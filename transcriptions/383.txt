[00:00.000 --> 00:05.520]  I guess we should just knock out the sad news right at the beginning Jason and do the obituaries.
[00:10.480 --> 00:13.760]  Yeah, let's do it. Let's put them up top. That's how I like it.
[00:13.760 --> 00:20.400]  We got John Warnock, co-founder of Adobe. He died about a week ago. The Times had a good
[00:21.360 --> 00:28.480]  obituary. I was kind of taken aback. Adobe did not do the sort of our founder died,
[00:28.480 --> 00:34.400]  let's devote our homepage to a obituary. Like, I mean, the canonical example would be what
[00:34.400 --> 00:40.560]  Apple did when Steve Jobs died. Adobe just sort of had like a statement, but they didn't really
[00:41.680 --> 00:46.080]  market on their website. They're too busy trying to sell you on doing
[00:46.800 --> 00:51.280]  marketing things with your website or whatever they do now.
[00:51.280 --> 00:58.400]  It still is the Adobe I love, but there's also the new Adobe that does stuff that I don't
[00:58.400 --> 01:01.680]  think I want to know about. The ad tech Adobe.
[01:02.400 --> 01:06.800]  Yeah. When I was at IDG, we used Omniture for a while, which is part of Adobe and it's all the,
[01:06.800 --> 01:10.960]  yeah, it's like ad tech and analysis and stats and marketing tools and all of that,
[01:10.960 --> 01:16.480]  which I understand they got a lot of people who are in the advertising business and then the
[01:16.480 --> 01:21.840]  marketing business. And it's one of those ways, like all this talk, I'm sure we're going to talk
[01:21.840 --> 01:27.360]  about, about like businesses Apple is in that you would never have bet they would have been in.
[01:27.360 --> 01:31.840]  And are there going to be other weird businesses that they are going to go in that we will be
[01:31.840 --> 01:37.280]  shocked by today? But like Adobe's like that, right? Where they're like, they still do Photoshop.
[01:37.280 --> 01:43.520]  They still do all of the creative apps. They're still building new apps. They still have like
[01:43.520 --> 01:50.560]  teams of scientists and mathematicians working on wild, like AI image recognition features and
[01:50.560 --> 01:56.320]  all of that stuff. But they also have now this built this whole side business and, or, or maybe
[01:56.320 --> 01:59.920]  it's the main business. I actually don't know the size of it, but it's like, yeah, marketing tools
[01:59.920 --> 02:05.120]  for big companies. I don't know, but, but Warnock, he wrote illustrator and Warnock and Geschke,
[02:05.120 --> 02:11.840]  the two founders Geschke passed away a couple of years ago, just pivotal knowledgeable computer
[02:11.840 --> 02:16.160]  people who also decided that they were going to just take that tech and build their own business.
[02:16.160 --> 02:22.320]  And PostScript obviously is the, the, the biggest intersection with, with Apple, where Steve jobs
[02:22.880 --> 02:28.320]  saw that and was like, Oh my God. And they made the laser writer, essentially it's a collaboration
[02:28.320 --> 02:34.640]  between Apple and Adobe. And the laser writer itself changed the course of the publishing
[02:34.640 --> 02:38.080]  industry at the very least, and probably the computer industry at the same time.
[02:38.080 --> 02:43.680]  Trenton Larkin And it's just sometimes at this point in our
[02:43.680 --> 02:49.440]  careers, it's like, we've been doing this long enough yet. We still have a long way ahead of us
[02:49.440 --> 02:54.960]  knock on wood, hopefully, but I'm blown away. And I I'll just say it, we'll get to it later, but
[02:55.680 --> 03:02.320]  talking about the iPad as a person, it can't be your main computer, the, the never ending topic.
[03:02.320 --> 03:08.640]  And it's like, in some ways, it feels like it's moving so slow. And Steven trout and Smith
[03:09.280 --> 03:15.360]  pointed out, I added it to the show notes a 2013 article 10 years ago, I wrote an article that
[03:15.360 --> 03:19.120]  was pretty much covering the exact same stuff that you and I were writing about this week.
[03:20.960 --> 03:25.680]  10 years. And it's like, no, I know that the iPad has gotten better to the last 10 years,
[03:25.680 --> 03:33.760]  a lot of ways, but not crazy fast. Whereas desktop publishing, the Macintosh didn't even exist
[03:33.760 --> 03:42.160]  until 1984. And the laser writer comes out in 1985. Illustrator, I looked it up was 87.
[03:42.880 --> 03:51.840]  By like 1988, the publishing industry had largely moved to the Macintosh and digital publishing,
[03:51.840 --> 03:58.080]  like in four years, the, an industry that you could arguably date back to Gutenberg
[03:59.040 --> 04:06.960]  had entirely switched to doing it on computers, because it was so much better. And it happened,
[04:06.960 --> 04:11.920]  that happened so fast. But because I was a kid at the time, I thought that was just totally normal.
[04:11.920 --> 04:17.760]  Right? No, it was a there was a lot, I would say there's a lot of pent up, pent up inspiration going
[04:17.760 --> 04:21.600]  on there, right? Whereas like, we just need a computer that can do this, we just need something
[04:21.600 --> 04:26.000]  that can do this. And then all of a sudden there was this explosion and it was like, did the Mac,
[04:26.720 --> 04:30.720]  like everybody had its precursor, but like the Mac leading to that point and then having
[04:30.720 --> 04:36.800]  Warnock and Geschke at Adobe and saying, we can do postscript. And you put those together with the
[04:36.800 --> 04:40.880]  hardware of the laser writer and you put it together with page maker and then later Quark
[04:40.880 --> 04:47.280]  express, you put it together with Photoshop and illustrator. And it, that, it just kept that ball
[04:47.280 --> 04:53.520]  just kept rolling for a very long time. And by the time, yeah, five years had passed,
[04:53.520 --> 04:57.680]  the whole industry had already been transformed. And yeah, just like that.
[04:58.720 --> 05:05.840]  I wrote in my little brief sort of, I don't know, call it a bit, whatever you want to call when I,
[05:05.840 --> 05:10.080]  you know, just add a couple of thoughts when somebody dies or something about the way that
[05:10.960 --> 05:14.640]  they did not settle. And to me, it's exactly, I really do think it's why
[05:14.640 --> 05:20.240]  Adobe and Apple continue to have, I think, a pretty, pretty friendly corporate relationship.
[05:20.240 --> 05:24.880]  And certainly on and off over the years, they obviously got along with Steve Jobs.
[05:24.880 --> 05:29.200]  The laser writer, as you just alluded to, was a total collaboration. Apple sold it,
[05:29.200 --> 05:32.880]  and it was an Apple hardware product that connected to Apple's computers,
[05:33.440 --> 05:40.000]  but entirely based on postscript technology that was Adobe's. Totally a joint collaboration.
[05:40.000 --> 05:47.600]  And in those 80s years, if you were doing desktop publishing on a Macintosh,
[05:48.240 --> 05:55.280]  effectively part of your system software was from Adobe. Adobe Type Manager was effectively,
[05:56.160 --> 06:02.240]  in those days, extend, all extensions ran. No, there was no kernel, really. But so they
[06:02.240 --> 06:07.200]  effectively all ran in kernel space. And infamously, any kind of conflict or bug in a
[06:07.200 --> 06:12.080]  third-party extension could just freeze up, collapse your entire system or whatever. But
[06:12.880 --> 06:16.720]  if you were there at the time, nobody even called it Adobe Type Manager. It was ATM.
[06:17.920 --> 06:26.880]  And the extension was always spelled tilde ATM, because unlike now where tilde
[06:26.880 --> 06:33.680]  sorts to the top A to Z alphabetically, and for some reason in Mac Roman text encoding,
[06:33.680 --> 06:39.920]  in classic Mac OS, tilde sorted to the bottom. And you always wanted ATM to load last,
[06:39.920 --> 06:45.840]  so whatever other shenanigans your extensions were doing, ATM patched the traps last.
[06:46.640 --> 06:53.920]  But ATM was amazing, because it rendered these outline fonts on your screen,
[06:54.560 --> 06:59.200]  and they looked like the fonts, but they weren't bitmap fonts drawn pixel for pixel.
[06:59.200 --> 07:08.000]  Some reader who thanked me for my post but couldn't believe I didn't mention the term
[07:08.000 --> 07:14.320]  WYSIWYG, which at the time was, whether we were writing about it professionally or before that,
[07:14.320 --> 07:19.440]  just talking about the Mac, you couldn't go two paragraphs without talking WYSIWYG.
[07:19.440 --> 07:24.080]  What you see is what you get, because it was transformative. The idea that you actually
[07:24.080 --> 07:29.840]  could see on screen what you would get when you printed seems so obvious.
[07:30.880 --> 07:34.800]  But up until that point, it was nothing like that.
[07:34.800 --> 07:39.840]  People don't understand the idea that it used to be you're writing your college term paper,
[07:39.840 --> 07:45.040]  let's say, because this is a true story about me, in Microsoft Word. It's a little short.
[07:45.040 --> 07:50.240]  You wrote it in 12-point, but you need to pump it up a little bit, and you put it in 13-point.
[07:50.240 --> 07:56.640]  It will print on a laser writer and look great, but on your screen it looked like crap,
[07:56.640 --> 08:04.720]  because the bitmap font that was displaying on your pixel-y screen only came in certain type
[08:05.520 --> 08:11.360]  faces, and they were outlined or shadowed in the fonts menu as well. You knew which ones were
[08:11.360 --> 08:14.560]  the good ones that you could use, but when you printed it, it would print fine.
[08:15.120 --> 08:19.520]  ATM was that moment where Adobe was basically patching macOS to say,
[08:19.520 --> 08:25.200]  if we've got an outline, we can make it look okay on your screen. It'll be fine.
[08:26.160 --> 08:34.480]  Before that, there was as different as doing any sort of typography, even just
[08:34.480 --> 08:38.640]  rudimentary word processing for a school paper where you were just happy to use
[08:39.200 --> 08:45.360]  Helvetica or Times New Roman. You weren't fussy about typefaces. You're picking one of the 12
[08:45.360 --> 08:51.920]  fonts that came with the computer, which felt like a plethora of fonts compared to what we
[08:51.920 --> 09:01.200]  had before, which was where before it was, well, you had a typewriter or a
[09:01.200 --> 09:06.400]  quote-unquote word processor that was really just a typewriter with a couple of lines of memory,
[09:06.400 --> 09:13.360]  and you got 12-point courier and you liked it. That was it. But there was this odd similarity to
[09:13.360 --> 09:21.920]  setting hot metal type, where in hot metal type, if you're setting with little tiny pieces of type,
[09:22.640 --> 09:27.440]  obviously, whatever size that is, is the size you're going to get when it strikes the paper.
[09:27.440 --> 09:32.720]  Our bitmap fonts were like that. It was like we'd have nine pixel. We'd call them points,
[09:32.720 --> 09:43.680]  but the points were pixels. 9, 10, 12, 18, 24, 48, 72. And if you didn't like one of those,
[09:44.640 --> 09:49.520]  it's a tough one. You could set it to the others, but they looked terrible because they were just a
[09:49.520 --> 09:56.880]  mathematical sort of like expansion of it. They weren't based on the shapes, which were in
[09:56.880 --> 10:02.240]  the vectors, which was what PolkScript was all about, was creating a resolution independent of
[10:02.240 --> 10:09.680]  independent vector, and no font hinted every point size. It also means that you couldn't zoom
[10:09.680 --> 10:15.760]  effectively because that's cheating. If you zoom in on a document that's got a 12-point font,
[10:15.760 --> 10:20.320]  it's not 12-point on your screen anymore, and so it would look terrible.
[10:21.200 --> 10:25.440]  I remember one of my first encounters when I really fell for the Mac was at my college
[10:25.440 --> 10:31.600]  newspaper and we had PageMaker, and there's that moment where you zoom in and it redraws the
[10:31.600 --> 10:38.400]  letters and you're like, oh my God, they're still clear. And if you zoom out far enough,
[10:38.400 --> 10:42.640]  they just all turns into a gray square because it's like, nope, forget it. Can't even, not going
[10:42.640 --> 10:49.200]  to try. And then Jobs, because Jobs, right, so savvy. When he went to Next, one of the first
[10:49.200 --> 10:54.160]  things they did was like they built their Next Step operating system on display PostScript,
[10:54.160 --> 11:00.720]  which was just, we're going to use PostScript as our display layer. And that ended up coming back
[11:00.720 --> 11:09.360]  to macOS in OS X with like Quartz and like, so PostScript ended up inspiring Next and then
[11:09.360 --> 11:15.200]  wrapping back around and being a key part of the concept of how OS X, and trust me, like,
[11:15.200 --> 11:18.240]  oh, the hard, I don't know if you ever used a Next Step computer, but like,
[11:19.040 --> 11:23.520]  oh, the processors at the time really struggled to try and like render PostScript on the screen.
[11:23.520 --> 11:29.040]  But I got the idea, right? The idea is, yeah, we should probably just use these fundamental
[11:29.040 --> 11:33.600]  resolution independent outlines to draw everything on the screen. And by the time we got sort of into
[11:33.600 --> 11:39.120]  the OS X era, you could do all that stuff and it looked good. Yeah, I was infinitely curious
[11:39.120 --> 11:46.080]  about the Next computers, but Drexel had, as far as I knew, one. There was one that I knew of in
[11:46.080 --> 11:51.600]  the computer lab and I got to, I don't know, kick the tires on it. I mean, pretty much spent about
[11:51.600 --> 11:58.080]  as much time as I would have if there were retail stores where you could have, but I could see.
[11:58.080 --> 12:04.480]  Mine was University Bookstore had one and I spent like a good hour on the stupid
[12:05.040 --> 12:08.480]  display unit at the University Bookstore because it's the only way I was ever going to touch one.
[12:08.480 --> 12:14.640]  Yeah, it was vaguely reminiscent of the early versions of Mac OS X in that the screen was slow
[12:14.640 --> 12:20.080]  to refresh because you could see what it was doing. And you could see that it was elegant
[12:20.080 --> 12:25.680]  and doing it correctly in some sort of abstract notion of, oh, this is the way to draw everything,
[12:25.680 --> 12:31.360]  do it all with PostScript right on the screen. And everything that could be an outline is an outline
[12:31.920 --> 12:36.880]  or a vector graphic or something like that. And everything that could be scalable is scalable.
[12:36.880 --> 12:43.760]  But yes, the computers, even though the Next was like started at $10,000, way too slow,
[12:43.760 --> 12:48.720]  really, to handle it at the time. I do know this. I didn't mention it. It's just, again,
[12:48.720 --> 12:54.080]  the guy just died. I don't know. It's not the time to drudge up the unpleasant stuff,
[12:54.080 --> 13:01.680]  but I've talked to people, more than one person, engineers at Apple who more or less have been
[13:01.680 --> 13:11.200]  there since the Next era. And Next's use of display PostScript was technologically advanced
[13:11.200 --> 13:19.840]  and clearly the right thing to do. And like as you said, absolutely is why the groundwork they laid
[13:19.840 --> 13:25.120]  literally just goes straight through to all of these devices today, right up to the Vision Pro,
[13:25.120 --> 13:30.080]  which isn't even out yet. That there's this, you can just trace the operating system through in
[13:30.080 --> 13:35.040]  this way and the way that it handles graphics, certainly. But the relationship between Next and
[13:35.040 --> 13:41.280]  Adobe was contentious. It's the way that Next kind of got pushed around. It bothered Jobs.
[13:41.280 --> 13:46.480]  Steve Jobs does not remind anybody of the sort of executive who liked being pushed around and
[13:46.480 --> 13:52.880]  bullied by bigger companies and being sort of overlooked by the press at large and written
[13:52.880 --> 13:59.440]  about in the past tense. But the basic story, and this is all never written. This is all like
[13:59.440 --> 14:06.800]  stories told over beers at Macworlds and WWDCs long past, but Next didn't have the source code
[14:06.800 --> 14:11.600]  to display PostScript. They had a licensing agreement, obviously, and they were allowed
[14:11.600 --> 14:19.120]  to use it, but they only got to take like the binaries and put them in the operating system.
[14:19.120 --> 14:27.760]  And so when Next engineers needed to do work that involved actual display PostScript code,
[14:28.400 --> 14:35.040]  they had to go to Adobe and work in what effectively an air-gapped room without
[14:35.040 --> 14:43.440]  internet access. And it breeds resentment, I guess, more or less. Like, okay, you guys can
[14:43.440 --> 14:49.920]  come in, but it's like you got to, I don't know if they went through a magnetometer, but effectively
[14:49.920 --> 14:54.320]  just anything that Adobe could do to make sure that they weren't sneaking out the source code
[14:54.320 --> 14:59.840]  to PostScript, they would sit there, do all the work at somebody else's office, possibly depending
[14:59.840 --> 15:04.560]  on how intense it was. It wasn't just like, oh, we need to come in and spend five minutes fixing
[15:04.560 --> 15:09.040]  a bug. It might be a major new feature. It might've been when they added color to Next,
[15:09.040 --> 15:15.200]  something super significant and difficult weeks at a time. But it's funny because these guys
[15:15.200 --> 15:20.160]  resented that, but then what has Apple done in the decades past when they invite third-party
[15:20.160 --> 15:26.320]  developers to come and work on unreleased operating systems and unreleased products like
[15:26.320 --> 15:34.400]  the iPad and Vision Pro now? It's like, come to us, come into a room. You walk out with nothing.
[15:35.280 --> 15:38.320]  It's the exact same thing. It's just, who's got the power now?
[15:39.520 --> 15:46.320]  Yep. Yep. The other thing I just, I'll bring up this story from when I was in college studying
[15:46.320 --> 15:52.320]  computer science at Drexel. One of my very, I guess, quite honestly, my favorite in hindsight
[15:52.320 --> 16:00.960]  professor, his name is David Manganyaske, and I had him for a couple of classes, but he had written
[16:00.960 --> 16:10.480]  his PhD, I guess, dissertation on PostScript. I had him in around 93, 94. I don't know when
[16:10.480 --> 16:16.000]  he got his PhD, but he was pretty young for a professor. But he had written his dissertation
[16:16.000 --> 16:21.440]  about PostScript and doing stuff, and so he knew, and he had these amazing little programs. They
[16:21.440 --> 16:27.920]  were amazing. PostScript really is a programming language, but it doesn't look like JavaScript or
[16:27.920 --> 16:35.600]  C or the way we think of most normal programming languages, but it is. If you do write it as a
[16:35.600 --> 16:41.920]  human, you can kind of follow the gist of it. But he would have these amazing little 13-line
[16:41.920 --> 16:48.240]  programs that would draw incredibly intricate fractals. You know what I mean? What was that
[16:48.240 --> 16:55.280]  thing we had as a kid with the pencil, the spirograph? When you look at currency very close
[16:55.280 --> 17:03.280]  and you look at the fine-grained 3D etched artwork, it would be like 17 lines of code,
[17:04.000 --> 17:10.720]  and you would get this amazing stuff out of it. PostScript was amazing like that, but it's so,
[17:11.360 --> 17:17.280]  as I wrote, the thing that makes Adobe, Adobe made Warnock and what was the other guy's name?
[17:17.280 --> 17:19.680]  Chuck Kesky. Chuck Kesky.
[17:19.680 --> 17:24.560]  Was that they never stopped when they invented PostScript. They were like,
[17:24.560 --> 17:28.720]  this is nowhere near enough. Illustrator is the perfect example because it really was
[17:28.720 --> 17:36.880]  just a front end to PostScript purely. And it wasn't like, oh, well, the smart people will
[17:36.880 --> 17:44.320]  just write PostScript directly and we'll build PostScript for dummies and put it on the Macintosh
[17:44.320 --> 17:49.360]  and you can click and drag and do some things. And if you really want to do something serious,
[17:49.360 --> 17:54.320]  you'll have to poke into the hood and find the closest person who knows how to write actual
[17:54.320 --> 18:01.200]  PostScript and they'll go into your Illustrator file and do the real hard work in actual PostScript.
[18:01.200 --> 18:07.440]  No, it was a complete encapsulation. And maybe I'm drawn to that word encapsulation because of the
[18:07.440 --> 18:14.640]  EPS format, encapsulated PostScript. EPS files still are part of the publishing industry. PDF
[18:14.640 --> 18:23.280]  sort of is a superset of EPS, but the encapsulated PostScript format was like the native format of
[18:23.280 --> 18:28.640]  Illustrator and Illustrator, the app was conceptually a complete encapsulation of
[18:28.640 --> 18:36.480]  PostScript. It was just a word to the millions of graphic designers who still use Illustrator.
[18:36.480 --> 18:41.840]  PostScript is just a word that they don't need to really know anything about. It's all there
[18:41.840 --> 18:49.760]  as a visual tool for visual artists working in visual medium. And I think most of the times in
[18:49.760 --> 18:55.200]  history, somebody invents something like PostScript and they're so proud of it and they're so focused
[18:55.200 --> 19:02.080]  on it because their mind works like as a programming language inventor. They're not the
[19:02.080 --> 19:08.640]  same people who have the mind to create a complete visual GUI tool that encapsulates it.
[19:08.640 --> 19:12.080]  Right. You created this amazing thing. Now what are we going to do with it? And the answer is,
[19:12.080 --> 19:15.040]  what do you mean? We'll just make it better. It's like, no, no, no. You got to do something
[19:15.040 --> 19:19.360]  with it because artists need this. So we had artists in college. We had this one incredible
[19:19.360 --> 19:24.640]  artist in my college newspaper, and this is like 1991. So it's the very early days of this.
[19:24.640 --> 19:28.480]  And his medium was Illustrator. He just passed away a couple of years ago. His name is Mel
[19:28.480 --> 19:33.520]  Marcello. This guy was a genius. He was still making like posters that are hanging in like
[19:33.520 --> 19:38.960]  sports venues and stuff. He was so great with Illustrator. And I remember I would see these
[19:38.960 --> 19:43.680]  things and when you would, you would see whether you were in Illustrator or Photoshop or no,
[19:43.680 --> 19:51.680]  Illustrator or page maker, you'd see it actually draw all the objects on screen one by one. So you,
[19:52.240 --> 19:56.960]  because back then they wouldn't often wouldn't render a preview. And so you'd have to watch it
[19:56.960 --> 20:01.760]  draw live with all of the shading and everything. And so you, it was almost like these videos of
[20:01.760 --> 20:07.760]  people making a sketch on an iPad where you're seeing not just the finished image, but like
[20:07.760 --> 20:13.360]  all the layers and all the different shapes that are built up by the artist to get to the point
[20:13.360 --> 20:17.600]  where you get that final image. And it was just amazing. And that was, so his medium was
[20:17.600 --> 20:23.120]  Illustrator, which means essentially his medium was PostScript. And then the other thing about
[20:23.120 --> 20:28.480]  Adobe and Warnock and Geschke is right when I started a Mac user, my boss was Pam Piffner,
[20:28.480 --> 20:32.720]  who ended up writing a book that is out of print, but you can get it places. It's essentially the
[20:32.720 --> 20:36.640]  Adobe story. I mean, it was for their 20th anniversary. It's called inside the publishing
[20:36.640 --> 20:41.600]  revolution. So she was deep down in this and she was my first boss. And that was when they were
[20:41.600 --> 20:46.320]  trying to popularize PDF and release Acrobat. And at the time it was like kind of a hard sell,
[20:46.320 --> 20:52.400]  but Acrobat, the whole premise of Acrobat and PDF was PostScript was not actually portable.
[20:52.400 --> 20:58.560]  PostScript, you had to rely on embedded fonts or fonts that were on the hardware. You didn't know,
[20:58.560 --> 21:04.080]  I did a magazine when I was in college and I laid it out in page maker and I had to do it as a
[21:04.080 --> 21:08.240]  PostScript file. And it was like, I couldn't use anything, but the fonts that were on every single
[21:08.240 --> 21:12.880]  PostScript fender printer, because otherwise you just couldn't do it. And so they said,
[21:12.880 --> 21:18.640]  what we need to do is make something that will be available everywhere, like a piece of paper
[21:18.640 --> 21:22.480]  for any document. And it'll look the same everywhere without the overhead. And it took
[21:22.480 --> 21:28.080]  them a long time. It was super hard for them to sell it at the very beginning. And I think about
[21:28.080 --> 21:33.600]  that now, cause that was a long time ago, right? I started at Mac user in 94. So we're coming up on
[21:34.560 --> 21:43.840]  too many years there, right? It's coming up on 30 years, but like now we were trying to register
[21:43.840 --> 21:49.680]  my daughter's car in Oregon, cause she lives in Oregon now and graduated from college. And
[21:50.400 --> 21:57.920]  every DMV form is a PDF, California, Oregon, doesn't matter. Everything is a PDF. And that
[21:57.920 --> 22:01.040]  was one of those things where there was a vision thing on their part. Like they knew
[22:01.840 --> 22:09.040]  PostScript wasn't the end result. It was a pathway to a bunch of things they wanted to do. And it
[22:09.040 --> 22:14.480]  took a lot of time and a lot of effort for PDF to get where it is. But at this point, everybody
[22:14.480 --> 22:20.640]  just it's a PDF. What is a PDF? It's paper. It's it. And that's exactly what they always
[22:20.640 --> 22:26.240]  meant for it to be is what it is now, but it took them decades of work to get it there.
[22:26.240 --> 22:33.600]  Yeah. And there really was this straddle between the history, hundreds year old history of print,
[22:33.600 --> 22:41.040]  which had hundreds of years of tradition and and technological advances to get print to the true
[22:41.040 --> 22:48.800]  non computerized print design printing to the point where by the eighties it had reached the
[22:48.800 --> 22:54.000]  apex in the same way that every technology is at its best, right? When it's about to be replaced
[22:54.000 --> 23:01.680]  like the very best, smoothest propeller passenger jets came right before the jet era, you know,
[23:01.680 --> 23:08.000]  you know, made them irrelevant. And print forms could be as beautiful as your ability to make them
[23:08.880 --> 23:14.000]  yet was print. And you had to put ink on paper and tallying results if you were printing some
[23:14.000 --> 23:20.080]  kind of survey or whatever would be lots of manual labor, lots of manual labor just to actually print
[23:20.080 --> 23:25.760]  and distribute them. And computerization makes all sorts of stuff easier. But everything that
[23:25.760 --> 23:32.800]  came out of computers was ugly and or at the very least crude, if not ugly, right? Just blocky,
[23:33.520 --> 23:40.880]  visible dots even on the printed output. And it was Adobe at a large level. I mean,
[23:41.440 --> 23:47.040]  Apple obviously had an interest in it, but Adobe really more even, I think, obviously more so than
[23:47.040 --> 23:54.480]  Apple in the professional tool space for desktop publishing really pushed for, hey, this we should
[23:54.480 --> 24:01.280]  be able to use computers to make stuff that's even better looking than print because computers
[24:01.280 --> 24:05.920]  give human superpowers. They're the bicycle for the mind. We shouldn't settle for, oh,
[24:05.920 --> 24:12.160]  if it's computerized, it's easier and faster, but looks crude. It should be beautiful.
[24:13.360 --> 24:18.880]  And I remember the moment, one of those transformative moments for me is we laid out our
[24:18.880 --> 24:24.160]  college newspaper, like I said, in PageMaker, but we still shot all of our halftones in order,
[24:24.160 --> 24:28.960]  you got to take a continuous tone, a black and white photo in order to make a color or not
[24:28.960 --> 24:34.000]  color in order to make it print. Well, it's like photocopying a regular thing in a Xerox machine,
[24:34.000 --> 24:39.040]  right? It comes out. It's awful. So what you do is you use a stat camera and you basically make
[24:39.040 --> 24:44.720]  a halftone of it, which is the whole thing becomes like pixels. It becomes dots, dots and absence of
[24:44.720 --> 24:52.320]  dots. And then you can reproduce that directly. Okay, great. We got a scanner my junior year,
[24:52.320 --> 24:57.840]  I think in college and I scanned a photo and it's like, oh my God. And you could place the photo,
[24:57.840 --> 25:02.400]  you could move the photo around in PageMaker. And one of the things you could do was click on the
[25:02.400 --> 25:10.000]  thing and say, put a screen on it. And then when it printed, it was, it was ready to go for the
[25:10.000 --> 25:16.000]  camera without us having to hand a print to someone who had to take it into a dark room,
[25:16.000 --> 25:20.720]  who had to use a stat camera to turn it into a halftone that would then get pasted down.
[25:20.720 --> 25:28.240]  And it was a moment that I remembered where I was like, can we do this? Can we take a picture and
[25:28.240 --> 25:34.400]  put it, print it out of the computer and print it? And it looked different in fact, because the dot
[25:34.400 --> 25:40.320]  patterns were finer and more sophisticated, but, but it worked. And it was just an amazing moment.
[25:40.320 --> 25:45.760]  Like I cannot believe the computers let us do this stuff now because it was, I could feel us
[25:45.760 --> 25:52.000]  just leaving the past behind when I did that. Yeah. I was like a year or two behind you on
[25:52.000 --> 25:56.720]  that. So we were, I was all scared. My, my college newspaper time was all through the scanner and we
[25:56.720 --> 26:03.760]  were, we've talked about this on my show before QuarkXPress, not PageMaker. But I remember when
[26:03.760 --> 26:12.560]  we got at this, at the newspaper, our first 1200 DPI laser printers, and we figured out,
[26:12.560 --> 26:17.280]  Oh my God, we could make the screens, these black and white photos look so much better.
[26:17.280 --> 26:22.480]  And they were all photo ready. And then we sent them. And then that issue of the Drexel triangle,
[26:22.480 --> 26:28.720]  the photos all looked terrible because then it met the analog world of newspaper,
[26:28.720 --> 26:33.360]  ink hitting newsprint paper. The press, the press couldn't handle 1200 DPI.
[26:34.320 --> 26:40.480]  We didn't actually screen at 1200, but I forget what we did, but we made what we sent photo ready
[26:40.480 --> 26:45.360]  to the printer looked way better than anything we'd been sending up until that point. But then
[26:45.360 --> 26:50.480]  when the ink blobs go that small, it looked at then all these photos that we thought were going
[26:50.480 --> 26:57.200]  to look better than ever all looked like a photocopy of a fax that, that had been crumpled
[26:57.200 --> 27:03.040]  up into a ball and smoothed out or something. It was terrible. Anyway, hats off to, to John
[27:03.040 --> 27:07.920]  Warnock. What a, what a career. Absolutely. What a legacy. The other obituary, I think we can,
[27:07.920 --> 27:12.560]  we can spend less time on it, but our our good friend, everybody America's TV friend,
[27:12.560 --> 27:17.920]  Bob Barker, the host of the price is right. Died after a good long run at 99 years old.
[27:18.720 --> 27:23.760]  Almost, almost a hundred. He was a few months short, which led to a lot of funny people,
[27:23.760 --> 27:28.240]  bless them on the internet saying that Bob got as close to a hundred as he could possibly get.
[27:29.920 --> 27:34.800]  Amazing. And, and you made the same, I actually, I was visiting my mom this week and I said,
[27:34.800 --> 27:41.600]  did you see Bob Barker died? I said, he was every kid's sick day friend because that was,
[27:41.600 --> 27:45.680]  that show was on in the morning for an hour. You're a kid, you're home sick. What are you
[27:45.680 --> 27:48.960]  going to do? You just watch TV. There's nothing more you can do. You just got to lay there.
[27:49.520 --> 27:56.080]  And that was game shows are half an hour long. That game was an hour long. It was captivating.
[27:56.080 --> 28:01.120]  And then I look at daring fireball and you have written the same thing, which is he is the,
[28:01.120 --> 28:05.040]  he is your friend when you're a kid and it's, and you're sick home from school.
[28:05.600 --> 28:10.080]  It was definitely very strong memories of that snow day. A lot of snow days,
[28:10.080 --> 28:15.760]  if it was a nice snow day, we'd go out and play of course. But I guess actually we might even be like
[28:15.760 --> 28:21.440]  frozen and wet by the time that the price is right was on at 11 AM for us. So yeah,
[28:21.440 --> 28:26.240]  I think so. I think that was the time we might've actually even on snow days where we went out,
[28:26.240 --> 28:31.680]  been back in the house by the time it was price is right time, ringing out your socks and having some
[28:31.680 --> 28:35.920]  soup, but a lot of, a lot of snow days weren't really snow is more like ice or whatever.
[28:35.920 --> 28:40.800]  So you wouldn't go out and boom price is right. Of course, rainy summer days where you couldn't
[28:40.800 --> 28:44.640]  go out and play price is right. That was the one thing. And I had a sister, my sister's two years
[28:44.640 --> 28:50.880]  younger than me. And we might've fought over every other hour of the day, if we were both home,
[28:50.880 --> 28:54.880]  because it was a rainy summer day or a snow day or something. But one thing where there's never
[28:54.880 --> 29:03.040]  an argument about is 11. Well, of course price is right. Absolutely. And it is not to dig down too
[29:03.040 --> 29:08.080]  far into this rabbit hole, but like it was a show conceived as being for housewives. The whole idea
[29:08.080 --> 29:14.000]  of it was it's a daytime show it's for the housewives. And the whole idea is, is you know
[29:14.000 --> 29:18.560]  what housewives know about shopping because they are the shoppers in the family. So we're going to
[29:18.560 --> 29:26.080]  do a whole game show based on you guessing what things cost. Okay. That's fine. And yet people of
[29:26.080 --> 29:32.880]  our generation kids who did not know what cost were enthralled by the price is right. And I,
[29:32.880 --> 29:39.920]  I think it's because it had this Bob Barker, very friendly, and it had this bizarre sensibility in
[29:39.920 --> 29:44.160]  it. It was a bunch of mini games. We would say now for something like Mario party, right? It was
[29:44.160 --> 29:51.200]  mini games and they were all, they had weird designs, sometimes elegant, mostly not, but
[29:51.200 --> 29:56.960]  weird designs of the mini games. We had the little like yodeling guy going on the mountain. You had
[29:56.960 --> 30:01.920]  the big, big levers that you would pull and a number would come up. You had the big Plinko
[30:01.920 --> 30:06.800]  thing where the they're all going down. Like there was some maniac who was in the art department of
[30:06.800 --> 30:13.360]  that who would invent these just bizarre little mini games and they were so striking. And I think
[30:13.360 --> 30:18.400]  that's why kids liked it is if you got bored with it, you're onto the next one. And then it also
[30:18.400 --> 30:21.760]  means, you know what they all are and they had a rotating, whatever they had like 10 or 15 that
[30:21.760 --> 30:25.760]  would rotate and then you'd see it and you'd be like, Oh, I know this one. It was magical.
[30:25.760 --> 30:30.800]  It really was. I think that was part of what made it like, it's still on. It still is a popular
[30:30.800 --> 30:36.400]  show. And in that era, people who are younger than us or whose memories aren't as good as us,
[30:36.400 --> 30:41.280]  the whole morning was filled with, with game shows until it, until it became soap opera time.
[30:41.280 --> 30:45.440]  And then the soap operas came on, I guess after the Price is Right. It was like the Price is
[30:45.440 --> 30:50.400]  Right ended it. And news, you might have news at noon and then it was all soap operas after that.
[30:50.400 --> 30:58.160]  But that mini game format is what kept it fresh because every other game was 30 minutes of the
[30:58.160 --> 31:03.680]  exact same game every day. And some of them are great. I loved the, one of my all time favorites
[31:03.680 --> 31:07.120]  too was Dick Clark's, whatever. Pyramid.
[31:07.120 --> 31:13.040]  Yeah, but it changed over the year. $25,000, $64,000 pyramid, $100,000 pyramid. But the
[31:13.040 --> 31:19.120]  pyramid was a good game. But it was still, it was two rounds and the rounds were exactly the
[31:19.120 --> 31:24.800]  same every day. The Price is Right had these mini games. I wonder how many they had. I want to say,
[31:25.760 --> 31:27.200]  because of what, what would they do?
[31:27.200 --> 31:31.440]  In rotation at any given time, right? How many would have been there? I don't, I don't know.
[31:31.440 --> 31:36.000]  But it was six a day, right? Because it would be like the first three for the first spin-off
[31:36.000 --> 31:38.160]  and then the second three for the second spin-off.
[31:38.160 --> 31:39.040]  Sounds about right.
[31:39.040 --> 31:42.960]  So if there were six mini games a day, they must have had 20 or 30 of them,
[31:42.960 --> 31:48.000]  really. Cause I think if you went all week, you'd see some maybe more than once, but it was great.
[31:48.000 --> 31:52.160]  Cause they, and then the other thing they had that was fantastic is most of the time
[31:52.880 --> 31:58.400]  the normal prizes people were playing for would be like a dining room set or a brand new washer
[31:58.400 --> 32:03.920]  dryer, a big jet ski, jet skis or something like that. But, but at least once a day,
[32:03.920 --> 32:12.720]  somebody's game would be for a new car and everybody would go bananas. The whole crowd
[32:12.720 --> 32:18.720]  would go bananas. Me and my sister would go bananas. We'd be like, Oh my God. And it happened
[32:18.720 --> 32:26.880]  every day, somebody every day, but they, it wasn't like always the second spot or the seventh spot,
[32:26.880 --> 32:30.880]  or sometimes it would be the first person of the day. It would be like, Oh my God, the show only
[32:30.880 --> 32:36.160]  started three minutes ago. And already this lady's planned for a brand new Honda. Holy cow.
[32:36.720 --> 32:42.320]  Mm hmm. It's every day. Yeah. You can't just, you can't explain it even logically. I mean,
[32:42.320 --> 32:47.040]  we could, like I said, I think I, I can understand logically what it was, but as a kid, it was just
[32:47.040 --> 32:52.080]  like, give it to me. I'm I'm, I'm homesick. Give me an hour of this show. I want it. I hope the
[32:52.080 --> 32:56.960]  yodeling guys are on. I hope the big thing where you pull the handle and it tells you how many you
[32:56.960 --> 33:02.000]  got right is on, because those are my, my favorites. Like there was, yeah, it was magical.
[33:02.000 --> 33:06.560]  And Bob Barker was the guy at the center of it. Game show host is a tough job. And it's funny
[33:06.560 --> 33:11.760]  that some game show hosts live on in our memories. You mentioned Dick Clark. I was thinking about
[33:11.760 --> 33:16.560]  like Alex Trebek. Like there is something that Pat Sajak is retiring, right? Like there was something
[33:16.560 --> 33:20.960]  that the audience has really connected those hosts in, in a way. And, and Bob Barker, certainly
[33:20.960 --> 33:25.680]  that was my first thought was just like so many hours spent in front of the TV. Usually when I
[33:25.680 --> 33:31.360]  was homesick from school and he was, he, it was a great, that's just nostalgia, pure nostalgia
[33:31.360 --> 33:37.760]  right there. It's a bizarre human trait to be able to spend literally thousands of hours,
[33:37.760 --> 33:46.560]  hundreds of hours a year over dozens of years for Barker doing the exact same thing. And people
[33:46.560 --> 33:51.840]  don't get tired of you. It's like, all they get is they just, they just grow in affinity for your
[33:51.840 --> 33:55.920]  presence. I mean, and you and I could have wasted many, many hours on this show talking about our
[33:55.920 --> 34:00.320]  love of David Letterman and late night talk shows. I have the same thing, but it's a different kind
[34:00.320 --> 34:05.600]  of charisma and Pat Sajak sort of proved it by trying his hand at hosting a late night show,
[34:05.600 --> 34:10.000]  which lasted like, I don't know, four months or something like that. Just didn't have it as a
[34:10.000 --> 34:17.200]  late night host, but obviously has it in spades as the host of, to me, rather insipid game show,
[34:17.200 --> 34:22.960]  but yeah, it's not my favorite. Merv Griffin actually, who was, had his greatest success
[34:22.960 --> 34:29.200]  on camera as a talk show host, but he invented game shows and then went out and hired. And that's
[34:29.200 --> 34:33.760]  how he made his money was he invented game shows and made huge amounts of money from them.
[34:33.760 --> 34:39.680]  Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune being his babies. Right. Bringing back Jeopardy, which had a much
[34:39.680 --> 34:46.160]  lesser known run before the Alex Trebek era. And I guess inventing Wheel of Fortune whole cloth.
[34:46.160 --> 34:52.080]  No. And Jeopardy was his invention to begin with. He and his wife, yeah, the Art Fleming
[34:52.080 --> 34:55.920]  version too. He and his wife invented it. That Jeopardy song, everybody knows was written by
[34:55.920 --> 35:00.320]  Merv Griffin. It's just bananas. And then Wheel of Fortune, they actually brought back Jeopardy
[35:00.320 --> 35:04.880]  to pair it with Wheel of Fortune. And yeah, something about that. And I don't know if our
[35:04.880 --> 35:09.040]  kids have anything, are YouTubers comparable? I mean, like there weren't very many channels.
[35:09.040 --> 35:13.440]  There wasn't much to do. And it became this thing that you really formed a connection with. And so
[35:13.440 --> 35:17.680]  it's ninety nine. He had a good run. Good job. Didn't go over. Didn't go over.
[35:18.640 --> 35:22.800]  All right. Let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor of the day. It's our good friends
[35:22.800 --> 35:29.360]  at Trade Coffee. I'm literally fueled on trade coffee as we speak, although I'm off it for the
[35:29.360 --> 35:34.240]  day. We're recording too late in the afternoon, but it's coursing the caffeine from their coffees,
[35:34.240 --> 35:40.160]  coursing through my veins. Trade Coffee is a coffee service that makes it so simple to
[35:40.160 --> 35:46.480]  discover new coffees from over fifty five top independent roasters. And it enables you to make
[35:46.480 --> 35:52.000]  your best cup of coffee at home every day. They have a matching algorithm that curates coffee
[35:52.640 --> 35:57.040]  perfect for you. And it really is true. I've honestly stopped even giving them feedback
[35:57.040 --> 36:00.400]  because I just know that the coffee that comes from them, they've already dialed it in.
[36:00.400 --> 36:04.880]  But you start getting coffee from them. They send you an email. They don't badger you. And they say,
[36:04.880 --> 36:08.720]  like, how did you like that last coffee that we sent you? And you give it like a thumbs up or
[36:08.720 --> 36:15.120]  a thumbs down. And as you tell them how much you like the coffee they've sent you, they steer your
[36:15.120 --> 36:20.800]  choices. You can think about how collectively from their users, they kind of get a sense. Oh,
[36:20.800 --> 36:25.680]  people who like that also like this. People who didn't like that one so much. OK, we won't send
[36:25.680 --> 36:31.200]  them this, et cetera, et cetera. Totally works. I just get coffee that I don't even look at.
[36:31.200 --> 36:34.400]  I don't even bother like smelling it. I just know I'm going to like it.
[36:34.400 --> 36:40.320]  It's really, really great. And it just comes to your house on the schedule you set.
[36:41.040 --> 36:46.160]  All of their coffee is freshly roasted. And again, I always say it when I talk about trade coffee.
[36:46.160 --> 36:51.840]  Coffee is produce. It doesn't look like it. It looks and most supermarkets sell coffee,
[36:51.840 --> 36:56.160]  whether it's ground or whole bean, just sits on the shelf. You don't think of it. They don't
[36:56.160 --> 37:03.840]  put it in the produce section. But my opinion, they should. Roasted coffee goes doesn't go bad.
[37:03.840 --> 37:11.040]  It just goes bland very, very quickly. Coffee from trade always gets shipped within 48 hours
[37:11.040 --> 37:15.120]  of being roasted. And they always every every one of their roasters prints the date it was
[37:15.120 --> 37:20.320]  roasted on usually gets to my house in my hands four or five days after being roasted. Can't you
[37:20.320 --> 37:24.880]  can't beat it other than roasting beans yourself. I don't know how else you could beat it. It's just
[37:24.880 --> 37:31.440]  a fantastic service. And it's customizable up the wazoo in terms of your frequency.
[37:31.440 --> 37:34.800]  If you're going on vacation because it's summertime, you want to pause,
[37:34.800 --> 37:39.520]  you want to adjust your schedule. All of that is so super easy. Just go to the website,
[37:39.520 --> 37:45.840]  say skip the next one or pause for a week or switch to every two weeks instead of every week
[37:45.840 --> 37:50.960]  or whatever you want to do. You can do it at any time. Couldn't be great. And it's just hassle free.
[37:50.960 --> 37:57.360]  Just shows up at your door on a regular schedule. Can't beat it. Upgrade your morning routine with
[37:57.360 --> 38:01.840]  better coffee right now. Trade is offering listeners of the talk show a free bag of coffee

[38:22.400 --> 38:27.120]  iPhones coming up next month. I've often thought and I used to think about it with speed
[38:27.840 --> 38:32.640]  is and in the early years of iPhone, it was super noticeable, but it's all noticeable
[38:32.640 --> 38:39.040]  with most computers. But I've always thought that it's way easier to tell how fast a new one is
[38:39.840 --> 38:45.600]  after you've gotten completely used to it and then go back to the just one generation back
[38:45.600 --> 38:51.040]  and feel how much slower it is. And I always keep my old iPhones around for testing with
[38:51.040 --> 38:57.680]  you know, oh, I've got the old last year's OS on my last year's phone so that I can. Oh, is this
[38:57.680 --> 39:02.160]  new? Is this feature new? What what did this look like? Oh, here it is. And then I'll be like, wow,
[39:02.160 --> 39:08.800]  this scroll is slow. This is crazy. I had that experience this week with my AirPods. I've been
[39:08.800 --> 39:14.000]  using AirPods Pro 2 ever since they came out. And remember when I got them and I wrote I reviewed
[39:14.000 --> 39:20.320]  them very glowingly. It's one of my favorite Apple products. I think it's as much as I've
[39:20.320 --> 39:28.560]  as much as people love AirPods, I honestly think they're vastly underrated as augmented reality
[39:28.560 --> 39:34.080]  devices that everybody, especially with the pro versions that do the and the max that do the
[39:34.080 --> 39:38.400]  advanced noise cancellation stuff, which is going to get better this year. I don't have the beta
[39:38.400 --> 39:45.840]  software online, but anyway, I love my AirPods Pro 2. I'm glad I upgraded even though my AirPods Pro
[39:45.840 --> 39:52.720]  1 were fine and not lost or not battery deficient. But I thought this definitely sounds better,
[39:52.720 --> 39:57.840]  especially the noise reduction. And I wear them as a pedestrian walking around Philadelphia
[39:57.840 --> 40:02.000]  99 percent of the time. My use of AirPods is while walking around the city.
[40:02.800 --> 40:10.480]  But last week I had to go somewhere. Where was I? I forget. I don't know. I had a doctor appointment
[40:10.480 --> 40:17.120]  and it's, I don't know, like a one mile walk. So it's like two miles round trip. And I had to leave
[40:17.120 --> 40:22.720]  because, yeah, that's why I couldn't go look for my AirPods Pro 2. I didn't know where they were.
[40:22.720 --> 40:28.400]  And I thought, crap. But I knew time wise, I needed to leave right now and sort of briskly
[40:28.400 --> 40:35.040]  walk to make it on time anyway. So I took my AirPods Pro 1, which were still had a charge,
[40:35.040 --> 40:38.880]  and I knew where they were. They're in my office. My office is on the ground floor.
[40:38.880 --> 40:44.560]  They were easy to grab. And I'd use them for a two mile round trip walk. Wow. Did they sound terrible?
[40:46.240 --> 40:53.520]  I, I was blown away. They sound so, and it was podcasts, not music, just listening to podcasts.
[40:53.520 --> 40:57.440]  And it's not even the noise reduction. At first I was like, well, it's because the noise
[40:58.000 --> 41:02.640]  cancellation is not as advanced and it's not tuning out the traffic and the buses and the
[41:02.640 --> 41:08.720]  city noise as well. But even when I got to the doctor's office and was waiting in a quiet room,
[41:09.360 --> 41:16.560]  and I'm just listening to podcasts and I'm like, these sound so tinny and thin. And I couldn't wait
[41:16.560 --> 41:20.800]  to get home and find my AirPods Pro 2, which were just like up in my bedroom or whatever,
[41:21.360 --> 41:27.200]  and then do a side by side. And I'm like, I'm blown away at how much better I now see AirPods
[41:27.200 --> 41:32.880]  Pro 2 are compared to when they were brand new. And I was impressed by them and thought, yeah,
[41:32.880 --> 41:38.560]  this is worth an upgrade, but not blown away. And I just thought I'd tuck that into the show.
[41:39.760 --> 41:44.480]  Yep. They're great. I haven't, I don't think I've gone back, but it's hard to see in the moment,
[41:44.480 --> 41:48.960]  right? When you switch over, I agree switching back sometimes is the really when you see what
[41:48.960 --> 41:53.360]  you lose when you go backward and you're like, Oh, okay. That's the, that's the difference there.
[41:53.360 --> 41:58.000]  I love them. I, yeah, they're one of my favorite Apple products I think ever. And I was super
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.240]  skeptical originally about them. I'm like Apple headphones, come on. And the AirPods were great,
[42:02.240 --> 42:07.360]  but the AirPods Pro are the best. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I, I don't travel with anything
[42:07.360 --> 42:14.720]  else at this point. And talk about a product that just looking at them side by side, I mean,
[42:14.720 --> 42:19.040]  obviously they're headphones. So looking at them, isn't how you're supposed to judge them,
[42:19.040 --> 42:24.560]  but looking at them, boy, they sure don't look like a major upgrade. I mean, they look
[42:25.600 --> 42:31.040]  pretty much identical. It's a slightly different pattern of black on the white buds and they're
[42:31.600 --> 42:37.840]  slightly different ear cup rubber things that go in and the case is slightly different,
[42:37.840 --> 42:42.080]  but at a glance, it's impossible to tell them apart. It certainly doesn't look like it,
[42:42.080 --> 42:45.920]  but boy, do they sound different. And now it has me excited wondering where,
[42:45.920 --> 42:49.520]  when AirPods Pro 3 will come out, because if there is much of an improvement,
[42:50.240 --> 42:56.000]  boy, that's going to be something. I'm trying to think here. What else do we have? I guess we'll
[42:56.000 --> 43:00.800]  start going down the list. It's just one I want to get out of the way. It's a weird clickbait
[43:00.800 --> 43:05.920]  story. I put this in the notes. I don't know if you saw this, but my son, my son sent me this.
[43:05.920 --> 43:12.800]  He said, did you see Apple? That Apple is telling people not to sleep next to their iPhone when it's
[43:12.800 --> 43:18.640]  charging. And I thought that's insane. I can't believe my son is so illiterate that he would
[43:18.640 --> 43:22.000]  think that what, I don't know what he read that gave him that impression. I was like,
[43:22.000 --> 43:26.880]  send me a link. And he sent me a link on Yahoo news. And the headline is Apple says,
[43:26.880 --> 43:33.280]  don't sleep next to charging on phone. And I'm like, what you go through? And of course,
[43:33.280 --> 43:38.960]  Apple said no such thing. They said no such thing. The Apple actual support document,
[43:38.960 --> 43:45.760]  which I don't believe is new at all says here, I'm reading verbatim avoid prolonged skin contact
[43:45.760 --> 43:49.920]  with the charging cable and connector when the charging cable is connected to a power source,
[43:49.920 --> 43:56.080]  because it may cause discomfort or injury. Well, I don't know about that, but then the next sentence
[43:56.080 --> 44:04.320]  sleeping or sitting on the charging cable or connector should be avoided. Well, I don't know.
[44:04.320 --> 44:09.920]  That seems like good advice, right? Like this, I don't think it's a new document, but how that
[44:09.920 --> 44:18.640]  got spun into Apple says don't sleep next to a charging iPhone. I have no idea. But lo and behold,
[44:18.640 --> 44:23.840]  I found like two or three other stories now, like including one at the clickbait factory,
[44:23.840 --> 44:28.320]  the street.com more or less saying the same thing. Of course, the streets headline is even
[44:28.320 --> 44:37.360]  more clickbaity. It's Apple issues a surprise iPhone danger warning. I don't know what to do,
[44:37.360 --> 44:49.440]  Jason. You talked about this recently. I feel like SEO and broken media business models
[44:50.320 --> 44:56.560]  haven't just broken like Google searches are kind of broken now because they're full of
[44:56.560 --> 45:00.400]  garbage search for anything. And you'll get all these AI articles or you'll get a search
[45:00.400 --> 45:05.120]  for a recipe and you'll get a blog post with 3000 words. And then the recipes at the bottom,
[45:05.120 --> 45:08.960]  like, and it's all SEO or search for an old scene, that article, and you won't find it
[45:08.960 --> 45:13.440]  because they deleted it. Cause they think that it's SEO, but the one that, that really makes
[45:13.440 --> 45:21.920]  me dispirited is our people, professional media people, journalists, basically have apparently
[45:21.920 --> 45:28.960]  over the last few years, had it ground into them so much that you need to write clickbait headlines
[45:28.960 --> 45:34.800]  because the business model has been so embedded that the only way we make money is if somebody
[45:34.800 --> 45:40.800]  clicks through on the headline. So we have to get them to click and trick them in any way possible.
[45:40.800 --> 45:46.560]  And, and what really infuriates me is when it happens in a place where the business model does
[45:46.560 --> 45:53.360]  not require clickbait and they still do it because they've hired people who have grown up in this
[45:53.360 --> 46:00.000]  toxic clickbait environment. And my example that I, I texted to you last week is the San
[46:00.000 --> 46:07.040]  Francisco Chronicle, a website that is primarily for subscribers of its newspaper and website.
[46:07.040 --> 46:15.040]  And I am a subscriber. All their headlines are like this Bay Area city may be committing horrible
[46:15.040 --> 46:21.360]  racist acts. And I mean, it's just like, guys, I pay for it. Just tell me what city it is so I can
[46:21.360 --> 46:26.080]  decide if I want to read it or is headlines and subheads are supposed to be relevant. They're
[46:26.080 --> 46:31.680]  supposed to make me want to read the story because they've informed me whether it's for me or not.
[46:31.680 --> 46:38.080]  And yet, and I feel like given their business model, they, I doubt that there's somebody saying
[46:38.080 --> 46:42.880]  you got to write a clickbait headline. I think it's people who just have survived the last 15
[46:42.880 --> 46:48.880]  years in the media and they don't understand that headlines shouldn't be like that. But I feel like
[46:48.880 --> 46:55.520]  these are all examples of how broken the whole media ecosystem has gotten because of the last
[46:55.520 --> 47:00.160]  10 or 15 years at the web. And now it's like, it doesn't even matter if you need the clicks,
[47:00.160 --> 47:04.400]  you're just going to write the story as if it was clickbait or write the headline. It kills me.
[47:04.960 --> 47:11.760]  It's so bad. And this sleeping next to the iPhone thing, I hope it just I'm wrong and that by the
[47:11.760 --> 47:16.800]  time people listen to this show or like a week, a week or so, I just have a sick feeling though,
[47:16.800 --> 47:21.520]  that this coming week is going to have a dozen more of these stories because it's too good to
[47:21.520 --> 47:26.320]  pass up. Can we make that the, like, can we do a hit clickbait like headline for this episode
[47:26.320 --> 47:32.880]  of the talk show? Can we call it like my iPhone burned my pillow? You won't believe how we got
[47:32.880 --> 47:39.760]  burned recording this episode, right? This, this, this, yes, this object was set on fire by my
[47:39.760 --> 47:47.520]  iPhone. Won't believe it. It's really a pillow. It's like on the one hand, maybe me and you
[47:47.520 --> 47:56.880]  should be like, Hey, this just makes our work look better. You know, that our work stands out at all
[47:56.880 --> 48:02.640]  the places. I feel bad for these people. Like I see a lot of these, I don't know if you saw the
[48:02.640 --> 48:08.720]  timestamp on these. I'm not sure about that, but I, some of the worst stuff I see is on the weekend
[48:08.720 --> 48:13.840]  and it's very clearly somebody who is a low paid person. Who's trying, just trying to make it.
[48:14.480 --> 48:19.760]  And they ha you know, that they've got basically a gun to their head saying, you got to do this
[48:19.760 --> 48:24.080]  many posts on the weekend because our staff's not here. So we're bringing you in to write these
[48:24.080 --> 48:29.920]  posts. And that's when I really see the worst. And it's because those people are desperate and
[48:29.920 --> 48:34.880]  they will do anything to fulfill their quota so that they can get paid. And they're not,
[48:34.880 --> 48:40.320]  they're not on the top of their game and they don't necessarily, they don't. And some of these
[48:40.320 --> 48:44.720]  stories, like you mentioned that one story that sort of ran with this and reran it, they don't
[48:44.720 --> 48:49.760]  want to know, right? Like they don't want to write the article that debunks the story. They just want
[48:49.760 --> 48:55.280]  to pass the story on with some rewritten headlines. Nothing makes me more dispirited than when I'm in
[48:55.280 --> 48:59.680]  a Slack or a discord and somebody posts a news story and it's from a website and I click through
[48:59.680 --> 49:04.000]  and I realize that all they're doing is rewriting the original news story that came from somewhere
[49:04.000 --> 49:11.200]  else. And it's like, why just linked to the real story. Like I know that this is from we've got
[49:11.200 --> 49:18.640]  this covered or comic book fan number one.com. And it's like, yeah, that story was at variety.
[49:18.640 --> 49:23.840]  Can you just link to variety, please? Like they have a reporter who actually reported something,
[49:23.840 --> 49:29.200]  please. Can we link to that? It's and it's, it's getting worse because I know you do the
[49:29.200 --> 49:33.040]  same thing I do is you're trying to hunt through. You're like, well, let me find the original
[49:33.040 --> 49:38.000]  and they'll say it was originally reported by variety, but that's not the link. You have to
[49:38.000 --> 49:44.640]  go to like the next paragraph and they do have a link hidden somewhere, but it's not on the phrase
[49:44.640 --> 49:48.960]  as originally reported or first reported by variety. It's like, they're, they're making it
[49:48.960 --> 49:56.480]  even harder. Yeah. Cause they, they, they want, cause their SEO extends to all their links being
[49:56.480 --> 50:02.160]  self links. Right. And so the, on first reference, it'll be like, but it's a story about some actor
[50:02.160 --> 50:06.160]  and the link will be to their tag page about that actor with all their other stories about that
[50:06.160 --> 50:11.920]  actor, because that's how they can build up this search. Referral power, or at least they believe
[50:12.640 --> 50:17.840]  a consultant told them at one point several years ago that that's what they should do.
[50:17.840 --> 50:22.160]  And it's completely broken them now. And then you, cause you do, you want to find,
[50:22.160 --> 50:27.200]  I ended up doing a lot of Google searches where I, I put in the subject matter and variety or
[50:27.200 --> 50:33.120]  Hollywood reporter or whatever to see if I can find what they're talking about. And, and
[50:33.120 --> 50:37.920]  invariably when it's a game of telephone, where there's a clickbait article that's based on
[50:37.920 --> 50:43.680]  something out of context, and then it's rewritten, you have to, you have to go back several steps in
[50:43.680 --> 50:50.640]  order to get to something like a boring tech note on Apple's website. Yeah. Whole world's coming to
[50:50.640 --> 50:58.720]  an end, Mallory. I I'm hopeful that the, that the, some of this will get rewritten, that some,
[50:58.720 --> 51:03.920]  some of this, like now that there are websites that are more likely getting their money from
[51:03.920 --> 51:10.160]  people paying than from people coming in over the transom, that some, some of the people in
[51:10.160 --> 51:14.240]  charge will be like, please don't write that headline that way anymore. That's not what we do
[51:14.240 --> 51:18.080]  here. Right. Somebody has to stand up and say it because you've got people who spent their career
[51:18.080 --> 51:24.480]  having to write those bad headlines or writing those blog posts that feed, it's like, I can't
[51:24.480 --> 51:29.200]  investigate this or I won't get paid. I must just take it on face value because it's the only way I
[51:29.200 --> 51:33.600]  can get a post out of it. I hope that'll, that'll heal at least in some places, but I don't know,
[51:33.600 --> 51:39.040]  maybe it's irreparably broken. I don't know. Right. It, it, it comes back to like my, my love
[51:39.040 --> 51:46.880]  of outlining and proper outlining, not just a word processor that can, has a feature to make bullets
[51:46.880 --> 51:53.920]  indent, but like an omni outliner type app or the new app from Jesse Gross, Jean, the task paper,
[51:53.920 --> 52:00.240]  who's probably best known for it as a Mac app called bike named after the bicycle for the mind
[52:00.240 --> 52:05.360]  thing I alluded to earlier, which is a really, really great new, new ish. It's like a year old
[52:05.360 --> 52:11.280]  now Mac outliner. That's a proper outliner. But I love Jesse Gross, Jean trivia point,
[52:11.280 --> 52:17.680]  a distant cousin of my wife. They they share a great-grandfather it's wild. It's the name.
[52:17.680 --> 52:23.280]  It's the name small world. Wait, wait, wait, Mac developers, the Jesse name or the gross
[52:23.280 --> 52:28.960]  Jean. My wife's maiden name is Grosjean. But that's only because her grandfather decided
[52:28.960 --> 52:34.320]  it would sound better if it was more French. Well, her grandfather, her great-grandfather
[52:34.320 --> 52:38.480]  is gross Jean and that's Jesse's too. Yeah. We, we went through this like 10 years ago. I'm like,
[52:38.480 --> 52:42.880]  how could it, it's gotta be right. And it actually, they're totally, they're totally
[52:42.880 --> 52:46.640]  related, but so I paid attention and bike is great. And that's the bicycle for the mind thing.
[52:46.640 --> 52:53.520]  The idea of doing a proper, I dare I say it sort of Dave Weiner ask outliner as a way to structure
[52:53.520 --> 53:00.880]  your thoughts with the hierarchy. And that's what a newspaper front page was is if you really were
[53:00.880 --> 53:07.520]  short on time, you could just read the headlines and you'd basically have an idea of what was
[53:07.520 --> 53:14.480]  important in the world, the nation and your local community. Most, most newspapers aren't nationally
[53:14.480 --> 53:20.000]  focused. And then if you have a little more time or about a particular story, there'd be a subhead,
[53:20.000 --> 53:26.240]  which would give you like a second level of information that you'd be fairly well informed,
[53:26.240 --> 53:29.840]  at least what's going on. And then if you really want the details, read the details and the
[53:29.840 --> 53:34.880]  newspaper. And it's. It's the inverted pyramid, right? The whole idea of in for people who don't
[53:34.880 --> 53:39.040]  know journalism is, yeah, you read the headline, are you, are you committed? You read the subhead,
[53:39.040 --> 53:43.040]  are you committed? You read the lead, the first paragraph and literally journalists were always
[53:43.040 --> 53:48.320]  trained. The most important. Information goes in paragraph one. The second most goes in paragraph
[53:48.320 --> 53:54.080]  two and so on dating to the period of time when you would write these stories. And when they ran
[53:54.080 --> 53:59.280]  out of space, they would just cut the article at that point. So don't save your like big revelation
[53:59.280 --> 54:05.360]  for the end because nobody will read that far. And that's totally true. But that was in an era
[54:05.360 --> 54:10.000]  where you could say like, I bought your newspaper and now I am not going to read all 12 of these
[54:10.000 --> 54:14.320]  stories. I'm going to read the four that appeal to me the most, but you're competing with yourself
[54:14.320 --> 54:19.680]  and the product was already purchased. And so you're performing ultimately it's a customer
[54:19.680 --> 54:22.800]  service thing, right? It's the, it's what we would say in the computers. We'd say it was like the
[54:22.800 --> 54:28.720]  user experience, which is you bought our product. We want you to get the most out of it by clearly
[54:28.720 --> 54:35.200]  clearly labeling what all these articles are about. And the free web completely broke that
[54:35.200 --> 54:39.360]  where now it was all just like, we just need to trick you into your browser, loading this page
[54:39.360 --> 54:44.080]  so that the ads will load so that we'll get credit for that. Right, right. Because in the newspaper
[54:44.080 --> 54:49.680]  printed newspaper era, if you had the newspaper in your hand, it was assumed you'd already purchased
[54:49.680 --> 54:54.320]  it. Whether you're a subscriber or you bought it at the newsstand, you probably had already
[54:54.320 --> 55:00.000]  purchased it. So you already had the whole package. And so they could treat you accordingly,
[55:00.000 --> 55:05.200]  but it's pretty sad. I mean, it's different from like headless body and topless bar. That's
[55:05.200 --> 55:10.400]  literally, that is marketing, right? That is a huge tabloid front page that is meant to be
[55:11.520 --> 55:16.160]  caught, catches your eye and you buy a copy on the newsstand. That's a little different or a
[55:16.160 --> 55:21.520]  magazine cover or something. But once you're inside, like don't, I don't need to be tricked.
[55:21.520 --> 55:26.080]  Just tell me what it is. I just want to know what the story's about, please.
[55:27.280 --> 55:31.600]  For people who don't know the reference, I forget the actual details, but I just read that recently.
[55:31.600 --> 55:34.960]  I think, did I even link to it? But it was like the history of that headline.
[55:34.960 --> 55:40.080]  The guy who wrote that article died last year. I wrote the headline died last year. He was one
[55:40.080 --> 55:47.920]  of their classic Newark post headline writers and yeah, headless body and topless bar, the
[55:47.920 --> 55:51.840]  best headline of all time. Yeah, but my favorite detail of the headline,
[55:52.400 --> 55:58.800]  and it really was, it was like a gruesome murder. And, but they actually sent somebody from the
[55:58.800 --> 56:02.960]  newsroom before they started printing it. They knew it was the greatest, maybe the greatest
[56:02.960 --> 56:09.760]  tabloid headline of all time, but they sent somebody to confirm that there was some semblance
[56:09.760 --> 56:14.960]  of topless dancing in that bar at some times, like, so that they still had the integrity
[56:14.960 --> 56:18.560]  that they wouldn't have run it if it was like, well, there was some shady stuff going on in
[56:18.560 --> 56:24.400]  that bar, but no topless dancing, like, no, there was. And it was like, payphone, like boss,
[56:24.400 --> 56:28.640]  we got it. They definitely had topless dancing on Saturday nights go, but yeah,
[56:28.640 --> 56:33.520]  that's it. This is it. It's the, it's gotta be a topless bar. Mr. Musetto cried, right?
[56:33.520 --> 56:38.000]  This is the greatest headline of my career, but the post set a reporter who phoned from
[56:38.000 --> 56:43.280]  Queens to say that the relief of all that topless, it was amazing.
[56:43.280 --> 56:48.160]  And getting from Midtown or wherever the post headquarters to Queens was no easy task.
[56:48.160 --> 56:50.320]  Yeah. But set a guy out there just for that.
[56:50.320 --> 56:53.600]  Just for that. But that's, that's the integrity that even the New York Post,
[56:53.600 --> 56:58.560]  here we are singing the praises of the editorial and journalistic integrity of the New York Post,
[56:58.560 --> 57:01.520]  but that's where we are. Yeah. And that was a, I mean,
[57:01.520 --> 57:06.960]  that was in a day where that was a really tough fought over newspaper market. So there's a lot
[57:06.960 --> 57:10.960]  of competition and, and that, I mean, it was the clickbait of its day, those covers that were going
[57:10.960 --> 57:16.240]  to sell to commuters who were going into the city or walking down the block and you had the
[57:16.240 --> 57:21.760]  Post and the Daily News. And then probably like, if you're in Long Island, at least you had Newsday
[57:21.760 --> 57:25.840]  and you had the Times, obviously, and you're trying to figure out, does it catch my eye?
[57:25.840 --> 57:29.600]  Do I want to put down a quarter or whatever for it? And my, one of my journalism school
[57:29.600 --> 57:34.080]  professors was the city editor at the Daily News for many years. And I enjoyed the contempt he had
[57:34.080 --> 57:39.600]  for the New York Times and, and how he was really committed to like doing good journalism, but,
[57:39.600 --> 57:43.200]  and putting in the work and doing the footwork, but also realizing that
[57:43.200 --> 57:47.280]  you, you were trying to give people something that they wanted to see or wanted to read.
[57:48.560 --> 57:52.320]  Speaking of journalism, we can move on and talk about the Disney empire.
[57:53.120 --> 57:56.880]  Ah, yes. ABC news, the ESPN, let's talk about it.
[57:56.880 --> 58:02.640]  Actual, you don't think of Disney and journalism, but it's a big part of their business as it
[58:02.640 --> 58:09.600]  stands and you and I both simultaneously, although me slower and behind you as usual,
[58:09.600 --> 58:14.400]  wrote about the sort of, what would you call it? It's not a rumor even.
[58:15.040 --> 58:20.640]  Yeah. It's speculation, possibly motivated by some insiders information, but it was,
[58:20.640 --> 58:25.440]  yeah, it's basically this piece by Kim Masters and the Hollywood Reporter that basically says,
[58:26.000 --> 58:30.720]  this is an old rumor that everybody in the entertainment industry is tired of hearing,
[58:30.720 --> 58:35.920]  but it feels, I think it's a really well-framed article, speaking of like good journalism versus
[58:35.920 --> 58:43.600]  clickbait. She says, when I talk to insiders, this old thing that didn't make any sense seems
[58:43.600 --> 58:50.000]  like it might make more sense now. And it all is swirling around Bob Iger returning to Disney
[58:50.000 --> 58:55.920]  and being under kind of like a lot of pressure to change the business and get it back in growth mode.
[58:55.920 --> 59:01.120]  And that people within Hollywood think he might be positioning it for a sale, in which case he
[59:01.120 --> 59:06.240]  might sell off some of his assets in order to make it more a better position for a sale, perhaps even
[59:06.240 --> 59:11.680]  to a specific buyer like Apple. And then second, this thing that I hadn't really thought about
[59:11.680 --> 59:17.120]  until the last maybe month, which is the idea that technology companies are so much bigger,
[59:17.120 --> 59:22.560]  more profitable and have so much more market cap than entertainment companies. And one of
[59:22.560 --> 59:28.640]  these entertainment industry insiders quoted in the Hollywood Reporter story says, it's inevitable
[59:28.640 --> 59:33.280]  that the tech industry is going to eat these things because entertainment has now just become
[59:33.280 --> 59:38.720]  streaming content. And that's part of the tech bubble. And that they said, in the end, all that
[59:38.720 --> 59:44.960]  will be left is Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and one other from an entertainment company. And if that's
[59:44.960 --> 59:51.840]  the case, I think you and I look at it and say, well, if they're going to eat the entertainment
[59:51.840 --> 59:58.400]  industry alive, Apple and Disney certainly seem like they're the best partners in terms of their
[59:58.400 --> 01:00:03.680]  corporate culture and their fit. And I think that is, I think that's fundamentally true. I think
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:09.520]  it's arguable that Iger would want Apple to buy them. I always just come back to the thing that I
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:17.760]  know has stopped you too, which is, but why would Apple pay a hundred or $150 billion for some or
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:23.760]  all of Disney? That's a harder question to answer, right? I would just want to, before I forget, I
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:29.280]  just want to, and this is where I was like, I got to get Jason on the show because of this, but,
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:35.120]  but I just, I saw, I was still writing my piece. I saw that yours was out because I got bored and
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:41.040]  was looking at my feed reader. And as soon as I saw the headline, I just go in like, nope. Yeah.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:45.920]  It's like, I can't read his piece because I don't want it to pollute my thoughts. And I'm so glad I
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:52.000]  didn't because you tied it together with the Steve Jobs analogy of the Apple is exists at the
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.440]  intersection of technology and the liberal arts and Disney does too. And it's like, it really,
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:03.600]  and I think about it, pick Pixar imagineers at the, at the parks, like their ILM, like there's
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:08.320]  so many the, the, the new ILM like stagecraft thing where they're using like a gaming engine
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:15.280]  to beam. They put images on an LCD screen and they shoot it like it's on a set or out in,
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:21.040]  in the world. But it's actually like all of that is this incredible, our, our friend Todd Vizzeri,
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:26.560]  right. Who works at ILM. Like these are people who love film, they're creative artists, and they're
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:31.680]  also highly technical and understand what needs to be done on the technical side in order to make
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:38.000]  the creative art better. Like they are. People are like, Oh, Disney and theme parks and Apple
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.400]  doesn't make any sense. And I'm like, I don't know. Imagineering seems to be exactly what Apple
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:49.040]  does on an abstract level. And so like, that's why I say, I think culturally, they're actually
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:55.120]  pretty close. And of course jobs was a big, it was when he sold Pixar, he, he sold it to Disney.
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:00.480]  So that is a Steve Jobs company that's inside Disney. He became a leading shareholder of Disney.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:08.800]  Iger was on Apple's board. Like there are so many connections here that like, I, I think that if
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:15.360]  Apple were to buy Disney, they culturally would make it work. I don't think it would be like an
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:20.240]  AOL time Warner thing where, where they're like, Oh my God, we can't put these two companies
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:27.280]  together. I think that they are, they might be the two companies. Disney might be the company that is
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:32.480]  most like Apple in the world. Maybe Nintendo is the only other competitor here that would be like
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:38.960]  that. But like they, they see the world and I think a similar way. And that's, I think that's
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:43.200]  interesting when you, when you're musing about this, when you're speculating about it, I'm not
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:49.840]  sure, again, it makes the case that they should buy them, but I think if you can see it right,
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:56.720]  you can see that resonance between them. There's like an unquenchable thirst for higher
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:02.640]  production values. And it defines which company am I talking about? It's both right. And it doesn't
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:10.880]  matter every time there's a breakthrough, whether it's Apple with the iPhone. And it was like,
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:16.960]  it was only the fourth model that went to the retina displays that quadrupled the number of
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:23.200]  pixels per inch at a time when the first three iPhones were considered super high res, super
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:30.000]  smooth scrolling, beautiful displays, unquenchable. And I'll throw a shout out and I jotted it down
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.920]  on paper. I'll probably hopefully put it in the actual show notes, but there's a Neil Gabler
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:40.560]  biography of Walt Disney, The Man, which is one of my, usually I'm either bored to tears by a
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:45.280]  biography and never even finished chapter three, or I gobbled the whole book up and this was one of
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:51.520]  them. But like the early years of animated films, they were a sensation. They were, they, it was,
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:55.840]  it was like a technological, I mean, motion pictures were a sensation. I mean, people
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:01.360]  screamed when, when the first one that was widely distributed showed a train coming towards the
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:06.000]  screen because nobody had ever seen anything like this before. And they thought people panicked and
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.600]  literally panicked and thought something might burst through the screen. People going to the
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:16.320]  movies on Saturdays gave people something to do and see that they'd never had before.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:25.120]  But the way that Disney, the Disney studio never stopped pushing the state of the art forward,
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:31.120]  technically, they did this, I think it was with Snow White, which again, just doing a feature
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:36.720]  length animated movie like Snow White, everybody was like, almost again, like Apple, nobody's going
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:41.520]  to buy that. That's Pan. Everybody thought cartoons were something, yes, kids like them for
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:47.040]  five minutes before the real movie, but nobody's going to watch a 90 minute cartoon. And of course,
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:52.880]  yeah, it turned out the opposite. Kids love big, long feature length cartoons, but they invented
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:05:01.120]  so many technological things to fake 3D and depth. And multi-plane camera, the whole thing. They,
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:08.480]  they actually, I don't think it's there anymore, but Disney, the Hollywood studios park in Florida
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:15.680]  used to have one of the attractions. And again, it's like, guess which, how many people in the
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:23.840]  Gruber family liked going to see the Walt Disney museum in the theme park? It was, I'll tell you,
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:32.320]  it was 33%. But they had that multi-plane contraption. They had the actual one or one
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:37.520]  of several that they used and I'd read about it and it sounded fascinating. It wasn't like,
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:41.200]  oh, and then they invented that. And then they stopped. It was just onward, onward,
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.120]  onward. When the theme parks are the same way, there's this culture. You could see it.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:51.920]  One thing I tried to look up and I couldn't find it. And so maybe I'm imagining it, but
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:06:03.280]  it would have happened around 1994, 95, 96, when Apple was the bad years for Apple.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:09.280]  Obviously, I mean, it was a whole side note, but I think the closest Apple ever came to getting
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:15.680]  acquired by another company was Sun Microsystems who easily could have afforded it at the time.
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:20.720]  And Scott McNeely was like, but why, why would we buy a company with no technology we wanted?
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:25.440]  So they, they passed more or less out of ambivalence, not, not out of price tag.
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:32.560]  Talk about like, where, where would the whole computing world be today? Who knows? But I seem
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:37.840]  to recall though, that at that time when Apple was in financial trouble, that there was idle
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:44.880]  speculation of this sort, that was Disney should buy Apple. Do you recall that? I can't. I searched
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:53.680]  for it. And because 94, 95, 96 was so early on the web, nothing that was on the web persists from
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:58.080]  that time or very little of it. It would have been in print, but I seem to recall. And I don't think
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:02.320]  it was, somebody must have speculated at the time because at the time Apple was in trouble and they
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:07.680]  were like, well, who should buy them? I seem to recall there were some people arguing, maybe just
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:12.640]  spouting off, pulling it out of their own butt, but saying Disney should buy Apple. And it's like,
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:18.480]  these companies ebb and flow over decades. And what comes around goes around. I don't think,
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:25.120]  I don't anticipate a time 20, 30 years from now where Disney once again would be big enough to
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:33.760]  buy Apple. I think that's sort of over, but it's been in the air for a long time. I also, I wonder,
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:41.600]  it was not just that Jobs sold Pixar to Disney. It's that I don't know how many studios they
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:48.000]  seriously shopped around who they were going to collaborate with other than Disney, right? I mean,
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.240]  it was like Disney and who was second choice at the time? Well, Disney had an exclusive
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:58.080]  distribution arrangement with Pixar that they were going to have to run out the clock on. So
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:02.560]  I think there was this thought that they were the only real suitable partner since they were yoked
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:10.000]  to them. Yeah, but when they made that agreement, right, before Toy Story even existed, I don't
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:16.880]  really think Steve Jobs and John Lasseter and everybody else in the Pixar brain trust really
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:21.280]  wanted to do this with anybody else. I mean, you know, Jobs, of course, is a famously good
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:27.840]  negotiator. I'm sure he did talk to, I don't know, Universal or Warner Brothers or whoever else might
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:33.840]  have possibly done it, but it just, even before they sold the company to them, just the whole
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:39.600]  idea, it just fit. It fit in a way that it just wouldn't have been the same otherwise. There was
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:48.400]  just, oh yeah, this is exactly, this is an out of character for Disney to make these movies like
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:55.600]  Toy Story and Bugs Life and Monsters Inc. These feel like they should be Disney movies in a way
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:01.280]  that even Disney owning Star Wars and Lucasfilm, I'm not saying that's unnatural, but it's nowhere
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:10.480]  near as natural as the Pixar sub-brand of Disney because it's just the kids and fantasy and stuff
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:15.520]  like that. And this has gone on, yeah, I don't know about the certain times, but these rumors
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:20.080]  have been out there on both sides. And today it's more referred to as Apple buying Disney,
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:24.960]  whereas back in the day, I think there was a talk about a merger. And even Iger said that he thought
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:30.720]  that that might happen, but today Apple has just in the last 10 years gotten so much bigger that
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:37.440]  that's not how it would be. And I think I've sort of been thinking about this a lot broader term,
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:43.120]  just as the overall, where are we as an industry and this whole big tech moment.
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:49.280]  Honestly, I really think it boils down to something very simple, which is that computers
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:58.880]  are as big a revolution to society as the industrial revolution was. It's not like a
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:08.640]  continuation of it or a tweak. It is that kind of step change. And I think in hindsight,
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:14.320]  everybody sees what the industrial revolution did to the world, but I'm sure that at the time,
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:23.840]  in the 1860s and 70s and 80s, it was underestimated by the adults who grew up pre-industrial
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:30.240]  revolution. And it was really only the industrialists themselves who fully understood
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:35.120]  it. And I think the same thing's going on with the computerization of everything, where
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:43.200]  people who don't really understand computers just underestimate how profoundly they're taking over
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:50.960]  everything. And naturally, it's almost inevitable that companies and very different approaches to
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:57.280]  the computerization of blank. Apple and Amazon are very different businesses. They all are,
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:03.920]  to some extent. None of them are quite like the others. Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and let's count
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:10.640]  Meta slash Facebook amongst them as one of the others in there. You can't look at any two of
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:15.360]  them and say, well, those two are doing the exact same thing. They're just arch rivals like Coke
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:20.960]  and Pepsi. No, they're all sort of different. But fundamentally, they're all humongous because the
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:30.960]  computerization of blank is just maybe two orders of magnitude at least. Apple is 10 or 11 times
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:37.440]  bigger than Disney by market cap. It's an entire order of magnitude. It makes sense that it's the
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:43.600]  computer companies that have the money to do it. And I just don't think, I do think if Disney were
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:54.320]  to continue to shrink in market cap stock price and Disney investors were so up in arms that a
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:12:01.280]  sale was sort of forced upon the company. Apple makes more sense than anybody in terms of who
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:08.720]  Disney would want. It's really just would Apple want to do it. That's where I just go back to. It
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:14.080]  just seems out of character for Apple in a way that it's not for Microsoft. Microsoft does things
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:20.800]  like buys Activision Blizzard for 69 billion. And sure, it's bold. It's not like they took it
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:26.720]  lightly. It's not like, ah, what the heck? Sure. Sure, Phil Spencer, go spend $69 billion on a game
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:32.960]  studio. I'm sure they, but they do things like that. Apple doesn't. The 3 billion, only 3 billion
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:38.960]  acquisition of Beats is by far their biggest acquisition. So I agree with you. And yet this is
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:46.880]  where I have to say Apple has changed. Their objectives are not necessarily what you would say
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:52.720]  as like, they're the most profitable company among the most in history, their most valuable company
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:57.280]  in history. What is left for them to do? And the answer is, well, Wall Street says, keep going,
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:03.200]  right? And that is just a fundamental of our economic system. So I would say they're huge.
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:07.600]  Where do they go from here? What other worlds do they have to conquer? And they have done so well
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:13.360]  with services. You and I have talked about this. Services has become, I die a little as an old time
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:18.160]  Mac user, I die a little inside every time that Tim Cook comes on the call and says, Apple's
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:22.880]  special brand is a combination of hardware and software and services. And I'm like, that third
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:27.760]  one, I don't know about that, but it is clearly a huge part of what they do. What I would say to you
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:33.920]  is if you're feeling the pressure of wall street to keep growing and you're like, how do we keep
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:41.360]  doing that? Well, services has been a way we do it. Apple has taken the Apple path up to now for
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:48.480]  TV plus, which is they are putting in a lot of money and they're building a catalog, but there's
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:52.960]  no back catalog to speak of some movies come and go, but there's really no catalog to speak of.
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:58.640]  They're building it. And they, they are a nice little boutique HBO ask service. And it's great.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:03.520]  I think they've done a very good job. I think it is exceeded all expectations of what a Zach
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:09.200]  and Jamie, who they hired from Sony have done. However, if you, if you say, okay,
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:14.800]  you're going to still make, how do we grow that? How do we expand that business? And how do we
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:19.840]  scale it? Cause it is not making TV shows is not necessarily a thing that really scales. We can
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:24.080]  give Zach and Jamie billions of dollars every year, but it's only going to be a pretty linear
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:30.640]  growth. And if you want to grow services massively over the next five years, how do you do that?
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:36.640]  The answer is probably buy a streaming service and all of their intellectual property, right?
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:43.360]  Or at least that's an answer. And that's what gives me pause is the idea that as nice a thing
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:51.200]  as Apple TV plus is they look at that and say, yeah, but you could just buy Disney and Hulu and
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:58.560]  Disney plus and star Wars and Pixar and, and all and Marvel. And, and you've got, and these parks,
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:04.080]  which actually they don't scale, but they are very profitable. And you like that, right? And you can
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:10.400]  just go down the list. That's what gives me pause is not Apple following what we think of as the
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:18.320]  Apple playbook, but Apple saying, Oh, services is good, is growing great. But what we really
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:23.920]  should do is take a quantum leap. And if they decide that that's when they buy, if not Disney,
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:30.960]  I think they buy some, some intellectual property and some services just to give them a big leap
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:37.600]  where suddenly it's not 20 nice TV shows and some movies, but it's literally all of Marvel and,
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:41.120]  and star Wars is in there now. And it's a much more relevant.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:47.920]  They were, I think more than just rumors, but obviously Apple didn't say anything, but by
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:52.880]  again, probably Hollywood reporter and variety reporting, both of which, again, it, it, I,
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:59.920]  as two long-term rivals, like Pepsi and Coke, it, it is odd to me that they both are still
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:05.520]  great publications, but I think one or both of them are just basically an, when, when
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:11.120]  Amazon bought United artists, Apple would apparently sniffed around it to buy that.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:17.520]  And that key franchise that United artists owns is the James Bond franchise near and dear to my
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:23.040]  heart. Perhaps even nearer and dearer to Phil Schiller's heart. Again, I don't think those
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:30.240]  MGM, the MGM assets, right. It doesn't matter how big a fan of James Bond, Phil Schiller is.
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:34.240]  I'm sure he wasn't advocating in their Monday morning executive meeting. We should buy them
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:40.480]  just so that we can get the rights to the James Bond theme song. But, you know, Apple
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:45.280]  sniffs around for stuff like that. I mean, it, it makes sense. You know, why not? They're in this
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:49.600]  streaming business. And if the price is right, they would do it. I guess the other thing that
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:54.800]  strikes me about that with, with the services narrative and I have that same, it's not a
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:02.720]  queasy, well, it's an uneasy feeling, right? Because it's like, you're, you're, the, the
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:10.080]  more Apple relies on the services stuff, it's towing the line with the dark side, right? And
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:18.960]  it's, it, all of a sudden, everybody who's an enthusiast has their complaints about things that,
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:26.320]  is this an ad or not? You bought a new iPhone and you didn't get Apple care plus and 30 days after
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:30.880]  you buy it. Now you've got a red dot on the settings app. That's saying, Hey, you've still
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:37.680]  got so many months left to buy Apple care plus for this. Or if you don't subscribe to Apple's
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:45.040]  media streaming their own ones, Apple music and Apple TV plus and Apple one, right? Which
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:51.120]  includes the fitness and stuff. They put things in the operating system that you pretty hard not
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:57.440]  to call an ad, even though they don't look like an ad it's, it's a form of advertising to take a
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:03.360]  row of the settings app at the top. Where do they draw the line? And you can see, I mean,
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:08.560]  people who complain about it, I think have valid points and people who think they've crossed the
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:14.400]  line may not be wrong. But I think even people who think they've crossed the line have to admit
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:21.360]  they haven't, they haven't become untethered in that direction, right? They're not flying out of
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:28.400]  control in the way that the latest versions of windows. There's some crazy stuff in a factory
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:35.920]  fresh install of windows on like a $400 PC with the number of ads. And they've gone back to,
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:40.720]  I think they've gone back to you have to get a different version of windows to install apps from
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:47.360]  outside their app store. And it's like, you can just reinstall it over. It's not like with the
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:53.360]  iPad or iPhone where you can just install an alternate version of iOS to get a version that
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:58.560]  lets you go outside the app store. You can do that with windows. It's still just a PC. You can put a
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:03.760]  full version of windows there, but Microsoft has gone so far in that direction in a way that
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:10.720]  it's like, take a look at where the rest of the industry is if you really want to
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:17.440]  bitch about apples. But I get it. And you have to say, when you follow the, the, the, I always just
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:24.480]  complete this. I just lean on six colors coverage of Apple's quarterly financials.
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:31.920]  I just wait to you post. And then I linked to Europe charts, but I follow them closely enough
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:40.800]  to know that they didn't lock into this. Tim Cook. I mean, it is as a pure CEO move, it is a strategy
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:46.080]  that he laid out. He explained it years ago, eight years ago, something he was like, we're going to
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:50.720]  whatever it was, triple our services revenue in the next four years. Or he said he at which they
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:54.960]  beat by a mile, but yeah, he laid it out in that one quarterly call where he's like, this is what
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:58.800]  we're going to do. This is our area of growth because it was a time when the iPhone revenue
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:02.720]  was kind of flat and everybody was like, how are you going to grow? Cause we want to see growth and
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:06.080]  he's like services. That's where it's going to be. And that's what gives me pause when people say
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:14.400]  Apple wouldn't do X, right? Cause it's like Apple hasn't done X so far, maybe, but who's to say like
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:19.920]  this, what decisions will they make? And I know that when you and Ben Thompson talk on dithering
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:28.080]  about this, like it is, it has been learned now by every streaming service that advertising is more
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:32.960]  profitable than having people pay for an ad free streaming service. And that's why Disney and
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:38.480]  Netflix and everybody else is creating ad versions of their services and then ramping up the price of
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:43.200]  the ad free version, because if they don't ramp it up, they're actually making less money from
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:48.320]  people paying them more than from people paying them less. And I wrote a piece of Mac world about
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:52.480]  this like three or four months ago. That was basically, it is inevitable that Apple TV plus
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:56.880]  will have an ad tier and it is, it just is. And that's so it's like, well, would Apple do that?
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:00.480]  It's like, well, they already have an ad business. There's already a, they have a vice senior vice
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:05.120]  president or whatever of advertising who is who has said that he's going to grow that business.
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:10.000]  Most of it is in like app store search and stuff now, but clearly they're going to go into this
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.640]  into this business of, of TV advertising. And you think, well, Apple's never going to do that,
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:18.480]  but they are. And, and I also hear sometimes like people were like,
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:22.400]  Oh, they're not going to be interested in ESPN. They have a gambling partnership that they just
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:27.200]  did for ESPN bet. And so that takes it off limits. It's like, I was watching Friday night baseball
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:33.280]  this week. And not only is the, is the pregame show have a segment about your betting line,
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:38.160]  but during the game, among of the odds of like chance that they'll get a hit chance,
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:42.560]  they'll get on base chance. They'll strike out. One of them was just straight up.
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:48.960]  Odds on the over under of the game in progress, right? That is an Apple commission and you can
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:53.200]  blame it on the MLB network that produces it. But like that stats company that's doing those stats,
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:59.200]  they only do that on Apple TV. Plus they have a deal with Apple and, and Apple's not like, no,
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:03.680]  no, no. Don't pretend that the gambling doesn't exist. The over and under doesn't matter. Like,
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:11.520]  no, it's there. It's right there. So be careful. When you say Apple wouldn't do it or Apple has
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:16.960]  never done it because it doesn't, maybe they have, and maybe they're trying stuff, but also
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:23.200]  you never know, like Apple would never produce TV shows and movies. Apple would never have a fitness
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:28.240]  feature where they have literally Apple employees who are fitness trainers in a studio in Santa
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:33.840]  Monica, like Apple would never until they do. And that's the, that's the part that gives me pause.
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:38.800]  It's like, I know they've never done it before, but I don't know. I mean, given the right
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:45.040]  circumstances they might. Yeah. And it's the best way I can put it is I'll use two analogies. There's
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:51.360]  dams crack and then they burst. And and then there's the Hemingway bankruptcy thing. How did
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:59.280]  it very slowly and all at once slowly and then, and then quickly, we have all sorts of other stuff
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:03.680]  to talk about here, but we obviously people who are familiar with your appearances on my show
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:11.280]  here know that we love, we love sports and we love TV sports. It it's just unbelievable how the dam
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:18.160]  broke on gambling with professional sports. And again, it is the computerization of everything.
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:23.600]  It's online gambling. This never would have happened. There is no, in my opinion,
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:30.240]  there is no roll of the roll of the dice for alternate versions of the 20th century where,
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:36.240]  where sports gambling is legal. And I don't know how many States it's up to now,
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:41.920]  but I think it's most of the country you can gamble on sports legally. There's no way that
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:48.400]  that happens before the internet. It just, it just wasn't true. I mean, New Jersey had casinos
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:54.080]  in the late seventies at a time when the only only state in the whole country where you could gamble
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:24:03.920]  at all legally was Nevada. And then Atlantic city opened real casinos in like 1977 or 78, but left
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:12.000]  out sports, which because it, it, it was just so verboten and they were like New Jersey sports
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:19.760]  gambling. No way like forget about it. There's the ID cause they were. And at least the idea was,
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:24.560]  and I think it's true in real casinos the blackjack games are on the level that roulette
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:29.600]  tables. They, the casinos want them perfectly fair. They, they don't want them to be crooked
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:34.400]  because the rules of the game, give them the edge. They don't need them to be crooked.
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:41.920]  But the fear with sports is that you introduce gambling and all of a sudden point shaving,
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:49.360]  fixing games, it's all that. And we're seeing some scandals with college sports players and coaches.
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:55.680]  There was, I forget which some obscure NCAA team, the coach tried to bet. Did you see that story?
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:01.920]  It was some, he tried to, he had like a friend try to bet a hundred thousand dollars on a game
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:07.360]  where there was only like $500 grand total bet. And they were like, sir, that's an unusually
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:12.000]  large wager. I mean, we're going to have to call a manager. And he said to them, don't worry. I have
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.320]  inside information. Yeah. Yeah. Cause the coach had told him that the starting pitcher or something
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:23.920]  wasn't going to pitch and yeah. And literally his excuse for trying to place this enormous wager on
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:28.880]  an obscure college baseball game was don't worry. I have, I have inside information.
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:33.920]  Yeah. That'll get them to accept your bet that it's that, that insider info is going to make
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:39.920]  sure that you have to pay. I've mentioned this before, or I remember one thing I noticed for
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:43.520]  years and years, cause I've always been interested in sports betting. Even when I couldn't do it
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:50.400]  legally was Al Michaels has always obviously been interested in it. Famous, the Dean of TV
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:56.000]  play by play announcers at this point, but he would often at the end of a like a football
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.200]  game with a 13 point lead. So the game isn't really up in the air, but somebody kicks a field
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:05.840]  goal at the end that crosses the over underline. And he'd be like, well, there's some people out
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:09.520]  there who are pretty happy about that field goal. And it's like, if you knew you knew,
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:15.280]  but he couldn't even say that's what put it over the, it was a 51 point over underline and it went
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:20.560]  from 48 total points scored to 51 or something like that. He couldn't say that he would just say,
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:25.840]  ah, there's some, some, some TV viewers out in Nevada who were interested in that field goal.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:32.400]  And it was just, you just daintily touch on it. And now the halftime show is brought to you by
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:40.080]  FanDuel and they've got people begging you to place bets on the second half in TV commercials.
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:44.960]  I have often brought this up. My family has gone on several Disney cruises over the years,
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:50.800]  cruise ships, as far as I know, every major cruise line, every cruise ship in the world has a casino
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:56.720]  somewhere on the ship because guess what? They make money. And once you're three miles out at
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:02.240]  sea, you're, you're only covered by international law. So it's legal. Guess whose cruise ships don't
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:10.800]  have casinos? Disney. But to me, and this gets to the, Hey, if Apple did buy Disney,
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:19.360]  they'd probably keep them wholly intact as Disney. Disney, they own ESPN. ESPN is totally
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:26.480]  full on into sports gambling in all the ways you, we just talked about, but there's no
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:32.560]  mouse logo on ESPN. Right? Exactly. Different brand, different rules. It's a different brand,
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:38.640]  different rules. And look at the way Apple's treated Beats headphones. Right? I there's
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:43.280]  obviously some engineer that it's not like some kind of isolated team. They get the same
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:50.560]  w one w two chips and integrate with the OS in the way that the only other brand of headphones
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:55.680]  that do are the AirPods that we talked about earlier on the show. But the industrial design
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:59.280]  of beats headphones, they don't look like Apple products. They look like beats products.
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:05.440]  Right. And they have, and beats has like a name image and licensing program with college athletes
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:10.320]  now where they're like given paying. Cause you can do that now you can pay college athletes to wear
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:15.680]  your headphones in this case. And like that's, and, and I would put that in the category of
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:20.080]  Apple would never write like Apple would never well beats is owned by Apple and beats is paying
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:25.280]  college athletes to wear their headphones. And that's the thing like, so, so I would argue
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:32.000]  whatever five, seven years ago, if I said, Oh, a couple of Sony executives, Jamie Ehrlich and
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.560]  Zach van Amber. Oh yeah. Like they're going to get hired by Apple and have their own offices in LA,
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:40.240]  but it's still Apple. And they're going to report to Eddie Q and they're going to make movies and
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:44.560]  TV shows and win awards. Oh, Apple would never do that. That sounds ridiculous. Right. Except
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:50.720]  that's literally what happened. And, and I, I think again, I'm not, I'm not trying to make
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:54.880]  the case that Apple should buy Disney here. I'm saying that I feel like a lot of people,
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:29:00.560]  I went on a rant about this in my podcast with my curly upgrade of like, I fear that a lot of
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:06.960]  people have a vision of Apple in their head. That is a little bit out of date because the Apple of
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:10.720]  today is so huge and they are, they, their tendrils are expanding into so many different
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:15.680]  areas. And it's very easy to say, Oh, that that's beyond like, Apple would never do that.
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:22.160]  Apple would never own a theme park. It's like, well, but like theme parks are very profitable
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:27.440]  and are very technological. And there's a lot of ways to fuss over the consumer experience
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:31.760]  and take and make a lot of money from people. Right. It's like, what part of that is not Apple,
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:38.000]  right? Like the theme park part, but not the other parts. And, and they have shown the ability
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:44.080]  to change in ways that are surprising, like having an entire entertainment wing that's run by
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:49.120]  entertainment executives. And yeah, they report to Eddie, but like Eddie's not ordering the shows
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:54.160]  right. Zach and Jamie are ordering the shows. Eddie's like working with them at a high level
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:30:00.400]  and setting their budget or whatever. That's the part of it that it's like, I know, I know it's
[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:06.160]  weird, but just like beats is doing its own thing in some areas, a Disney brand and an ESPN brand
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:12.640]  and anything that they would want to want to keep, they can set some rules. It's too easy and too
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:17.040]  facile. I think to say, Oh no, but Apple would never be involved with gambling or it doesn't
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:23.040]  make any sense. Like in the context of ESPN, maybe it does make sense, but that doesn't necessarily
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:28.800]  mean that it makes sense that to put a casino at Disneyland, right? Like probably not, probably
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:35.520]  not that. Right. They're not Disney's not going to do that, but, and Apple is not going to make,
[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:40.000]  and speaking of physical infrastructure and building out real world places in the year,
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.840]  2000, people thought it was crazy that Apple was building out its own retail stores. Why
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:48.160]  would a computer maker do that? Like gateway, even they're closing stores. So why would Apple,
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:52.000]  who has no idea what they're doing with retail do this? That doesn't make any sense. Well,
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:58.000]  today we have an entire generation of, of, uh, adults, my college aid son, I don't think could
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:03.120]  believe that you couldn't just go to the Apple store to get your iPhone fixed. I don't, I don't
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:06.880]  know if you've noticed this, but I've noticed this, that there are, there are certain people
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:12.160]  who listen to our shows and read what we write and all of that, who are vociferous defenders
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:18.720]  of Apple. And we'll say like, Apple, Apple has to have a reason for this. Apple can essentially
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:23.440]  like, they're, they're, they're fans and that's fine, but they're like, Apple could do anything.
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:28.400]  And yet then you say something about like, well, why didn't Apple do this? And the response is,
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:32.560]  Oh, Apple could never do that. That's too hard. And it's like, well, wait a second, which is,
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:37.200]  are they brilliant? And everything they do is right. Or are they incapable of solving a user
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:43.280]  interface problem in one of their platforms? Right. And I, I am a believer that Apple is
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:49.200]  incredibly capable of, of solving hard problems if they matter. And if they want to do them,
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:54.160]  this is one of those things where it's like, I just don't believe Apple would never, because
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:58.240]  I've seen it right. Retail is such a great example. It's like, Apple would never Apple.
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:04.640]  Why would they do an MP3 player? Right. Right. Like again, Apple would never until they do it.
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:11.600]  And then you, you say, Oh, of course. And so I'm not saying they will. I'm just saying maybe think
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:18.240]  for, instead of being negative about it, stop for a second and consider what if Apple owned
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:24.560]  Marvel and Pixar, Pixar and star Wars and Disney plus and Hulu, and what would they do? And what
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:29.440]  would that mean? You could view it as like, is it a good deal or a bad deal? Is it worth the money?
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:35.280]  But just think for a moment about like, isn't that would be interesting. And it's not so far a field
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:40.400]  to take us all the way back to that Hollywood reporter story. It used to be ludicrous. Now I
[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:47.840]  look at it and I'm like, maybe, maybe there it's maybe the biggest financial one in history is,
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:52.240]  well, blah, blah, blah. You know, cell phones are computers. Apple makes good computers and Apple
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:55.360]  makes good money, but blah, blah, blah. They're never going to do it. Cause they have to go
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:33:01.120]  through the carriers. Right. That was the thing. The argument pre iPhone ended with,
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:05.120]  well, Apple's never going to do this. Cause can you even imagine Steve jobs working with cell
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:12.000]  phone carriers, let alone in America, let alone all around the world. Well, guess what worked out.
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:16.640]  They did it. And they had, and, and, and there's this moment again, it's that idea that like Apple
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:20.720]  is amazing, but they, they, they, they certainly can't do that. It's like, they certainly can't
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:25.120]  work with dozens of carriers across the world and all sorts of different markets. And it's like,
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:30.400]  well, they, they do, they, they do. I remember even when the, the IMAX were coming out, the new
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:36.720]  IMAX, the M1 IMAX, I remember somebody sort of saying, Oh, you know, they can't do like all those
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:41.920]  different colors. Cause think of how many skews there would be. And it's like, they did, they did
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:49.280]  seven, six colors in silver, seven colors and color match cables and color match keyboards and
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:53.760]  color match track pads and color match mice, every one, a different skew. And they put it in their
[01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:58.880]  channel and it's all over the world online. And a lot of them in stores and they did that and they
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:05.280]  do the colors for the, like, yes, I know that it's really hard and it seems like, well, why would you
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:09.520]  do that? And the answer is if Apple thinks it's important, they will make it happen. They will
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:09.840]  find a way.
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:15.920]  Let me take a break here and thank our good friends at Memberful. Oh, Memberful, Memberful. If
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:22.480]  you're a creator, this is where you go and you can set up a membership system for your audience.
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:27.360]  And they have a whole team that is ready to simplify the, maybe you've already got something
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:31.280]  in place. You just want to take it to the next level. Maybe you're just starting out. They've
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:36.400]  got everything you need to grow your revenue with memberships. The most important thing I
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:42.560]  can say about Memberful as a customer of many, many Memberful creators and sites is that
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:47.120]  Memberful stays in the background. You don't know Memberful's there any more than you know
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:53.200]  who their web host provider is or what brand of pants they wear practically. You, the owner
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:35:00.960]  of the creative site or whatever it is, maintain full creative control over everything you present.
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:07.920]  You own the membership list so that if you ever decide to go elsewhere, you just take your
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:13.200]  membership list with you. They pay you directly to your Stripe account. Everything is right
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:19.200]  there in your control. They're just there to supply all the stuff you need to make it easy.
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:24.240]  And they make money when you make money. That's it. And they're there to help you with ideas
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:29.360]  or strategies for how to grow. They have experience, obviously, with all the sites that
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:35.520]  they are already using Memberful. Everything you need, checkout, easy to use customer member
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:39.680]  portal so members can go in and change their email address if they need to change their email
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:44.720]  address, update their credit card, all of that sort of stuff. The transactional emails, the
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:50.080]  receipts, a membership dashboard where you can go to see everybody who's your member.
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:55.280]  They've got analytics that give you easy, up-to-date, in-depth view of what's working,
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:36:01.200]  what's not, where you should put your emphasis, where you should steer your future example.
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:06.480]  They let you create things like members-only podcasts near and dear to probably everybody
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:10.480]  who's listening to this hard. I don't know if there's anybody listening to this who's not
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:15.040]  listening to some members-only podcasts. And there are some people who are on today's episode
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:22.320]  who have members-only podcasts. It's a big deal. So where do you go? Diversify your revenue stream
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:28.880]  with membership at Memberful. Six Colors is one of the places. Is the incomparable Memberful too?
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:33.440]  Yep. I have two different Memberful things and we use them for both and they both do a great job.
[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:38.560]  That's a pure, this is pure serendipity. This is not why Jason's on the show, but it's,
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:43.840]  I'm a member of Six Colors, happily paying, I think, I don't know, maybe you sent me a freebie,
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:49.920]  but I would happily pay, so you should cancel my freebie if it's free. Anyway, anything you need.
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:55.680]  Newsletters, podcasts, gift subscriptions, Apple Pay support, it's all there. Get started for free

[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:20.000]  in a service like that. No, they've served me well. What else did we coincide with this week?
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:25.680]  The iMac turned 25 and we both wrote about that. You wrote about, you wrote a terrific piece
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:31.920]  for The Verge of all places. Yeah. Caught me by surprise with that one. I ran into those guys
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:39.920]  at WWDC and they said, hey, it's the 25th anniversary of the iMac this summer. Would you
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:44.800]  like to write something for us about it? And I said, sure. I've written for them like three or
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:50.720]  four times, I think, since I left IDG back in the day. So I said, sure, that was great. And they
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:55.280]  said, don't write about design because I'm going to do a separate piece about design. And then that
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:38:00.720]  piece fell through right at the moment where I was feeling short of my word count. And I got the go
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:04.880]  ahead to write about the George Foreman grill. So then I threw that in there and then I was in
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:10.880]  pretty good shape, but it was fun to revisit that. I wrote about it a little bit for my 20 max for
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:20.000]  2020 project three years ago, but it was nice to try to sit there and rub my chin and think about
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:26.240]  the big picture about explaining to people who weren't around then maybe why it mattered so much.
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:32.720]  And the idea that in some ways the iMac, the places where the iMac made the biggest difference
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:37.760]  were not what you might think because like that original iMac, it was the only, the G3 iMac was
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:44.480]  the only one that used a CRT display. All the rest of them were flat panels. Des- desktops aren't as
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:51.520]  important as laptops are now, but it saved Apple. Like it literally saved Apple. It gave it the
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:57.440]  money to complete the OS X transition, which they needed. And then that, and then they had the money
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:05.520]  to do the iPod and it led, like all of those things had to get money from the iMac first and
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:10.880]  it really revived the Mac in general. And then I think the one that gets very little credit these
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:18.640]  days is USB, which was in existence before the G3 iMac, but it was just sort of kicking around
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:23.440]  in PC makers. They're like, well, we will put it on there maybe as an option, but like really
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:27.200]  everybody's gonna use parallel and serial and that's what it's going to be. And Steve Jobs was
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:36.160]  like, all things that we used to have, Mac serial, SCSI, ADB for keyboards and mice, and the floppy
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:42.400]  drive. I want them out. He kicked them out. And it's like, that's heresy. And that's one of those
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:49.120]  things that I think is a real legacy of the iMac is that it was a transgressive computer that broke
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:53.280]  compatibility in a bunch of different ways, benefited from the fact that it was the opening
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:57.760]  days of the internet and a Mac could survive on the internet. You would read your email and look
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:03.120]  at the web on the Mac, just as well as a PC. And that I think it's really striking that 25 years
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:09.040]  later, if you take that keyboard or that stupid round mouse, like I I'm sitting here in a Mac
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:14.000]  studio right now, I could literally take that stupid round mouse and plug it into my Mac studio
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:22.160]  without an adapter. And it works 25 years later. That's bizarre. That's crazy. But USB, right?
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:27.600]  That was the thing. And I think USB would not have made it as fast and been as popular. No,
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:32.320]  we're not for the kick in the pants that the iMac gave because they announced it in the spring and
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:38.160]  then, and then they shipped it in August. Every vendor of peripherals was like, uh, we'll have
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:41.920]  one where we're going to do a USB one. It was like, that was the moment where they realized
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:46.160]  they had to promise a USB product, even though they didn't have it yet and had to deliver it
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:51.440]  because they knew the iMac was going to be big. It's key that they got rid of the legacy ports
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:56.640]  and for Apple, it was ADB, which I still use an ADB keyboard, but with an adapter, but
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:03.200]  but the fact that they got rid of that, that's the difference, right? The PC way of doing a,
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:08.640]  it was, it really was true that even though USB had been out for a while, there were a lot of PCs
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:12.880]  that didn't even include it because they were like, well, we'd only be able to add it because
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:18.160]  of course we would just add it so that they could still use their serial keyboard and serial mouse.
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:22.000]  So if we're just going to add it, why bother? It's just another way of connecting a mouse. We've
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:29.440]  already got it. And if Apple had thought the same way, they would have included ADB. Of course,
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:33.440]  I'm sure the Apple way, if they had done that, would have been to make the new mouse and new
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:40.160]  keyboard USB use this new connector, but then the third parties wouldn't have jumped on it because
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:45.040]  they would have already said the Logitech and whoever else were making ADB mice at the time
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:49.760]  would say, well, just buy our ADB mouse. If you don't like this hockey puck mouse, just buy it.
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:55.680]  Whereas the fact that you either had to buy the one adapter, the Griffin iMate, which I'm not even
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:42:02.960]  sure when that came out, but of course it was blue translucent plastic, but it wasn't cheap even at
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:09.040]  the time. So it just forced all of a sudden the whole industry was like, well, we better make USB
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:13.520]  mice and a lot of people don't like this mouse, so there's a market for it. I mean, I don't think
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:18.480]  that was deliberate, and I always bring it up. My wife loved the mouse, used it for years
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:24.480]  afterwards, even when she no longer was using her purple iMac. It was not universally hated,
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:34.960]  but of course was mostly, mostly hated. James Thompson says that during OS X demos in the
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:42.720]  development of OS X, when Steve would come in to try something out, before he came in the room,
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:48.400]  they would take the round mouse and they would rotate it, just so when the first time Steve
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:53.440]  tried to use the mouse, he would just grab it and push up and it would go to the side and he'd get
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:58.800]  frustrated. And that was their way to just remind him, you got to get rid of this mouse. It's really
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:04.400]  bad. And they just would do it every time. And they did, right? Like in 2000. So two years later,
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:12.240]  two years later at Macworld Expo, they're like, we're sorry. We got an oval mouse for you now.
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:19.040]  Yeah. When they went from one color, I always pronounce it wrong, Bondi blue, Bondi blue?
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:25.360]  Bondi blue? It is Bondi. Even though that sounds like Bandai and the Power Rangers,
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:31.360]  it is Bondi, not Bondi. Bondi beach. It's Bondi beach, Australia.
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:37.040]  When they went to the five colors, didn't they add like a dimple on the mouse button? I think
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:43.040]  the original Bondi blue one had no dimple. So it was much, it was even easier to misorient because
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:47.920]  it was a circle. But anyway, the USB thing was super interesting. One thing that noted,
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:53.600]  I noticed last week, looking back on it was, forget if it was your piece or somebody else's
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:59.200]  or multiple of them, but talking about that, they showed like a, there was a closeup photograph of
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:08.880]  the ports panel on the iMac. And it just struck me how low the industrial design was. Like there
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:13.360]  were gaps around everything. It was just sort of a piece of plastic with a hole in it. And then
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:19.120]  behind it, you could see, they just put like a generic ethernet card. And there was like a gap
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:26.720]  around the ethernet port and a gap around the USB port. Like nothing was as seamless as it is
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:33.360]  quickly. It didn't take very long under the new jobs regime to start closing those little air gaps
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:41.040]  around things like that. It was very crude in some ways, looking just at the details of how the USB
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:48.800]  port melded with the plastic around it. I remember at the time I started writing Daring Fireball in
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:55.760]  2002, but I was equally obsessive about all of this stuff at the time. If anything, more worried,
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:45:01.680]  more obsessive because Apple seemed to be in trouble. And I really, it seemed pretty clear
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:07.600]  that if Apple didn't make it, I'd either have to switch to using Windows for everything or,
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:16.000]  I don't know, become a carpenter or something. But I remember being focused so much more on
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.640]  the OS story, right? And that's the whole reason they bought NeXT. The whole idea was we need a
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:26.240]  new next generation operating system. Our efforts internally had failed. We need something. We're
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:33.360]  either going to buy B or we're going to buy NeXT. We went with NeXT. And now here's the plan. And
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:39.520]  it kept changing. And it was all, it had to be. I mean, it's not a mistake, but it was like they
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:46.880]  bought them at Christmas, 1996. And so effectively beginning 1997. And they were like, we'll have
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:52.640]  this new operating system out in 1998. No. And then it was like, oh no, we'll have it out in 99,
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:46:01.040]  2001. I don't know. It's hard. OS X, Mac OS X was a very, very, very hard project to get to,
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:07.280]  but that's what I was focused on. And the up and downs of, well, so there was the Rhapsody and
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:13.120]  the blue box, the yellow box, the yellow box. Yeah. They were trying to figure out a way to
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:18.320]  navigate that thing where they could use most of the technology brought over by NeXT, but make it
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:24.560]  just compatible enough with the Mac that Mac users would be able to move to it and not have
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:31.200]  everything break. And that sort of became in the end, it became cocoa and carbon, but it was
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:35.200]  originally, it was going to be like an emulator for Mac OS. And they're like, no, no, no, no,
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:40.000]  no. We can't do that. And they, and they, but it was again, talk about things that don't get
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:47.360]  enough credit. The OS X development cycle that, because everything Apple makes is based on OS X,
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:52.480]  right? To this day, everything is, is, and that's a legacy from NeXT and some decisions they made
[01:46:52.480 --> 01:47:01.600]  in 98, 99, 2000, 2001, any misstep there, the jig is up. There was a strategy. I think the yellow
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:08.160]  box was the name of it. That was because NeXT step or open step ran on Intel hardware and there
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:15.680]  was, but there was an idea that what we now call cocoa would run on windows. And so like carbon
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:20.560]  apps would only run on Mac OS X or Rhapsody or whatever the name was and cocoa apps would run
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:25.840]  there too, and would be best there. But if you wrote for these NeXT frameworks, you could also
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:31.120]  run your apps on windows cause they were going to ship the, but the software, software, software,
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:36.960]  OS strategy frameworks was all what I was thinking. And I, my, it's very vivid. I just
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:42.880]  remember when the news broke that Apple shipped this new computer and it was like, Whoa, look at
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:49.840]  that. That is not just like a new beige box. This is a state, a hardware statement. I just,
[01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:54.560]  that's the, it was like a thunderclap moment. I didn't get to watch it live. I wasn't covering
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:48:00.880]  them. I wasn't at the Flint center or wherever it was held. They, there was no tech. It wasn't even
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:06.800]  possible to, to live stream the event. You had to read about it somewhere, but it made news,
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:11.840]  right? I mean, and it's, I linked to Steven Levy's cover story for, I think it was a cover
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:16.720]  story for Newsweek. Certainly should have been if it wasn't. And there was lots of coverage in
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:22.720]  fortune where Brent, he wrote the co-wrote the book beings becoming Steve jobs had, had a bunch
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:28.400]  of access to Steve jobs and he was on the cover there, but it just, cause it looked, it, it, it,
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:33.200]  it was meant for a magazine cover cause it was a very attractive device and it didn't look like
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:40.640]  other computers. Right. And it was like a statement and the whole idea of an all in one
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:47.920]  Macintosh, it just sort of, it was like a statement that said, this is still the Macintosh from 1984
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:56.480]  in some ways, right? There's, there is a, we're back to making things that are of the same DNA
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:49:01.120]  that, that made the Mac, what the Mac, the, the, the good parts that were worth saving.
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:05.600]  I said this in the verge piece, essentially when he came back to Apple, he's like,
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:09.200]  what do we have here? I actually likened it to the princess bride where it's like,
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:13.840]  can we get a list of assets? Why didn't you mention a wheelbarrow and a Holocaust cloak?
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:16.320]  Now we've got something. It was like that. And it's like, what do we have? Well,
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:19.680]  we got Johnny Ive. He's playing around with all this plastic stuff. Like, all right,
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:23.360]  well, we got this diskless workstation thing called Columbus. We could probably adapt that
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:26.720]  into something. It was like, all right. Okay. Okay. What else do we have? And then Steve jobs
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:31.520]  supplied. We have the original vision of the Mac, which is a computer for the rest of us and all in
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:37.120]  one that is not maybe the most ergonomic kind of thing, but you can move it around. It's got a
[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:44.160]  handle. It's got a carrying thing. And that was a huge advantage. And keep in mind, it was not that
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:51.680]  long after, right? It was 25 years since the iMac came out. The iMac came out, what, 14 years after
[01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:56.960]  the original Mac. So Steve came back to the company and he was like, we still haven't nailed
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:50:02.400]  that. Let's nail that. Let's go back to the idea of creating an appliance that is friendly, that
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:08.160]  you can put on the desk, that people will be able to use. And so he was playing the hits in a way.
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:12.720]  He was saying we didn't nail it with the original Mac because the computer industry didn't,
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:17.600]  computers didn't end up looking quite like the original Mac. The GUI sort of happened with
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:24.400]  Windows 95, but everything's a beige CRT with a bunch of cables and a beige modem and a beige
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:29.040]  computer tower and all of that. So like, let's do that. And we'll use the translucent plastic from
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:34.560]  that kid in the design team and we'll use this diskless workstation concept and we'll throw out
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:39.360]  a bunch of old stuff and we'll make it happen. I was struck thinking about it, struck by how much
[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:43.920]  it was really Jobs going back to his old playbook and saying, look, what was the original idea for
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:51.440]  the Mac? Let's do that again. And it is that, I mean, it really is what he envisioned. It's that
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:57.360]  same all-in-one thing that he was thinking of with the Mac. Yeah, it's probably as you're listening
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:51:03.440]  to me talk right now, the album art for this chapter, but there's a, it was from the second
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:11.840]  generation when they went to Five Colors, but the Yum poster, and I tweeted it on, well,
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:17.040]  whatever you call it, posted about it on Mastodon and Threads yesterday or the day before. And so
[01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:23.280]  many people responding to my post about what a great poster it was and just sort of, because I
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:28.480]  consider those five colored iMacs the original iMac too. It's just, it's not really a new generation.
[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:34.640]  It was just sort of the second. Oh, they're all G3 iMacs. And this, oh, this idea of translucent
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:39.200]  plastic is a hit. Well, yeah, let's do it in all the colors. I can't tell you how many people
[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:44.320]  responded to it and said, yeah, either I still have that poster or I did, and I wish I still
[01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:49.280]  had it. Walt Mossberg replied to me on Threads that it was hanging in his office at the Wall
[01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:57.120]  Street Journal for years. Just a statement, just, yes, computers are fun. They're super fun. So,
[01:51:57.120 --> 01:52:03.120]  let's make them look like they're fun, right? And the whole idea that let's just put everything you
[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:07.360]  need in the box, that's it. And because every other computer, like it wasn't just that they
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:12.160]  were boring and beige. It was that everything you needed for them, did you need another hard
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:19.440]  drive or an external drive or this or that? It was either a tower that you took apart, and God
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:23.920]  bless you with some of them getting to the components, but putting them into drive bays and
[01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:30.560]  hooking things up inside and then resealing the case. Or they were these external things that you
[01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:37.120]  stacked up on your desk and plugged in and just including the modem as an internal component.
[01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:42.880]  It sounded, again, I think a lot of the John Dvoraks of the world thought that was stupid.
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:47.280]  Why? If people want a modem, just buy the modem. It's not really safe. But it gave them,
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:55.840]  there's that poster that I love, that Yum! visual poster of the five iMacs. And the TV commercial
[01:52:55.840 --> 01:53:03.600]  that everyone remembers is the Jeff Goldblum one, right? No step three. And that is so Jobs, right?
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:08.080]  And that is the idea that you plug it in, and then you plug your phone line in basically into
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:13.040]  the iMac or the iMac into the phone line of the wall. And you're on the internet. And the internet
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:18.880]  is the also an unsung hero of this transition. Because like I said earlier, this was at a time
[01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:23.760]  where Windows had sort of won, right? Like with the Windows 95, they had kind of closed the gap
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:30.080]  as much as mattered to most people in terms of the user interface. But the internet, people wanted to
[01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:34.160]  just get on the internet, they wanted email, they wanted to see the web, they wanted online services
[01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:39.280]  and stuff like that. And the iMac could be sold and that's why it had the I in the name, right?
[01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:44.320]  The iMac could be sold as an internet appliance. It wasn't even like, does it run the program I run
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:48.400]  at my job or something? It's like, yeah, don't worry about that. You buy it, you plug it in
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:53.760]  these two things. And you're on the internet to do whatever things you could do to explore the
[01:53:53.760 --> 01:54:02.000]  internet. And that was a moment where suddenly being a Mac and not a PC didn't matter. And that
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:06.400]  was, I mean, how do you close the sale otherwise? If you're like, well, no, no, you can't buy an
[01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:11.440]  iMac because it doesn't get you on the internet, game over. But instead it was like, yeah, this is
[01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:17.280]  a stylish little blob that you can put on a table in your house and plug in these two things and
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:22.000]  you're on the internet. And that was super important to uptake of this product that it was
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:28.320]  not, oh, it's not compatible. It's scary because Macs, that's why people didn't buy Macs. Number
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:32.080]  one reason is that they weren't compatible with the rest of the world and they weren't compatible
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:36.320]  with the internet. And for a lot of people in 1998, that is all that matters. They literally
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:41.520]  weren't compatible with floppy disks. They took the same disks, but if you put a Mac floppy disk
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:46.880]  in a PC, it would be unrecognized. Do you want to format? You want to format this disk, right?
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:53.760]  Exactly. And the Mac eventually grew to, by necessity, grew to have the built-in ability to
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:55:01.440]  read DOS formatted FAT32 or FAT16, whatever the hell the format was, floppy disks. But vice versa,
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:08.000]  if it didn't go both ways, it wasn't compatible. So you couldn't even share a Word doc, even though
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:14.240]  I have Word on my Mac and you have Word on your PC and they could read the same.doc files or
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:19.040]  Excel files. I couldn't put a floppy disk in your computer and have you read it. So it was like,
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:22.960]  why am I even bothering with this? Right? Exactly. And I think that's one of the reasons
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:27.280]  that goes to why the iMac doesn't even bother with writable storage. It's part of the philosophy.
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:31.600]  It's like, look, you're not going to put things on a floppy disk. We're not going to do that anymore.
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:35.520]  And they knew that writable disks were coming. Writable CD-ROMs are coming. You could buy a
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:38.960]  USB floppy if you really wanted it, but they're like, no, no, no, no, no. Here's what you're
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:44.160]  going to do. It's got built-in ethernet. So if you're in a network, you just do it that way by
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:48.400]  file sharing. And otherwise it's got the modem. You're going to email that file. You're not going
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:54.880]  to walk it somewhere on a floppy. You're going to either use ethernet or you're going to email it
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:56:00.720]  because the internet is now what connects all of us. End of story. Yeah. And to go back to our
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:08.480]  graphic design print world work of the nineties, it had all moved to zip drives at the time,
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:13.840]  which were just by, by those standards, I think they were like a hundred megabytes. So they were
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:18.640]  like, yeah, it's like an order of magnitude better than a floppy disk or two, two orders
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:22.000]  of magnitude. It was like a hundred times bigger than, Oh, I guess you're right. Yeah. Yeah. It
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:26.480]  just it's yeah. Roughly this amazing, right? Roughly the same size as a floppy disk, but
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:30.800]  faster. Why do we still have the floppy? Why do we still have it? And the answer was because you
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:34.480]  might have to boot from it. It's like, forget it. Right. Like you boot from the CD-ROM drive and
[01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:40.080]  you'll like it. Right. It's like, okay, let's do this. So just brilliant. And that TV commercial,
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:46.080]  that was it. And people had this idea and it was true. It was new, but how do I get on the internet?
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:51.920]  Well, Jeff Goldblum told you, you plug the iMac into the wall for power and you plug the phone
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:56.560]  into the phone socket and Oh, that's it. There is no step three. That's it. No step. It was
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:02.960]  fantastic. And it really is true that for all the different weird names where Apple does not
[01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:09.440]  like to explain what they mean. What does the R in iPhone 10 R stand for? Well, you and I both,
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:14.160]  Oh, I always ask. And they didn't, they never tell you. They're like, whatever they told us what the
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:19.680]  I stood for. The I stood for internet, all of the products since the iPod, which is crazy because
[01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:28.160]  the iPod didn't have networking, but it eventually silently without explanation stood to mean cool
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:34.720]  Apple product. I would ever meant it was the cool thing from Apple, but with the iMac, the I stood
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:40.560]  for internet. And it absolutely was part of the reason, a huge part of the reason that Apple still
[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:47.440]  exists to this day, because in the early to mid nineties, all of the software Mojo was on the
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:53.440]  windows side. All the Mac had left was the graphic design, print production stuff and a dough to go
[01:57:53.440 --> 01:58:00.080]  back to Adobe circle back two hours ago, all the whole Adobe suite moved to windows and stayed in
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:05.520]  parallel. I, we could go off on a tangent about this, but like when Microsoft word six infamously
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:11.280]  shipped on the Mac with a very windows style interface compared to word five, which was a
[01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:20.560]  beloved Mac app, Mac users rejected it. And it took until office 98, speaking of 98 for the Mac
[01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:25.920]  to have, or Microsoft to build the Mac business unit, the Mac BU that was dedicated to building
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:33.840]  Mac style versions of the Microsoft apps. Windows users don't have tastes like that. So Adobe making
[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:39.840]  Mac style versions of Photoshop illustrator, it's the whatever else was in the suite.
[01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:45.840]  Windows users were like, whatever it was good. It was, well, it was like a ice water in hell.
[01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:50.240]  It was a better style, but if you were a Mac user used to Mac Photoshop and you had to use
[01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:54.400]  sit down in front of Photoshop and windows, it was the one part of windows. You're like, Oh,
[01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:58.800]  everything's the same. All the windows, all the menus are the same. The pallets are the same.
[01:58:58.800 --> 01:59:04.080]  The file formats are compatible. So. The best the Mac could do at the time was,
[01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:11.360]  Oh, well, like the Adobe suite is available on both and it's identical. But by the late 90s,
[01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:17.200]  all of the companies, you don't think of them as software companies, but what was amazon.com?
[01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:21.440]  It's a website is software, right? I mean, there's a hardware component to have the servers,
[01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:26.240]  but all the companies you had heard about these companies like Yahoo and Amazon,
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:32.000]  some Stanford research project called Google that's coming out. All of that stuff was on the
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:37.280]  web. And Bill Gates famously penned a memo where he kind of turned the company around where
[01:59:37.280 --> 01:59:42.480]  Microsoft was in denial about the fact that the windows hegemony, whatever,
[01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:48.080]  have you pronounced that word was kind of over the, the web was becoming the new universal
[01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:52.960]  platform, even more universal than windows. Cause if when they tried to undermine it,
[01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:57.200]  right with like things that were plugins that only ran on windows and things like that,
[01:59:57.200 --> 02:00:02.560]  but it didn't, it didn't work. It didn't take in the end. The, I came to represent Apple to the
[02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:06.720]  point where for a while there, I think you could argue that the, I was the most important brand
[02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:11.440]  at Apple, not the Apple logo, which is not what they wanted, but that's where they needed to,
[02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:16.640]  to start is like iPod is named the way it is because they wanted to say the iMac that's cool.
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:20.960]  Well, this is too. And they went and that's why we have the iPhone and the, and the iPad. And
[02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:25.920]  now today it's an Apple watch and Apple vision pro and all of that. But like,
[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:31.920]  there was a time when Apple, something was not as impactful as I, something,
[02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:36.560]  everything, even stuff that was all Mac that remained Mac only like the eyesight camera,
[02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:44.240]  which is a brand they should, it's just, it, it just was a prefix for Apple that, you know,
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:52.720]  it clearly was something that Steve jobs believed in that seemingly the rest of the company did not.
[02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:59.920]  I mean, I don't know who else, Johnny, Phil, but as soon as Steve jobs died, they stopped shipping
[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:05.040]  I named products. And, and while he was alive, everything, I mean, famously when he introduced
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:09.680]  the iPhone, what are we going to call it? Yeah, that's right. iPhone. Cause it was like in the
[02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:14.640]  speculation up to the release of the iPhone, somebody figured out Cisco own a trademark
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:20.000]  bizarrely for a product named iPhone and they worked it out. They paid them off or whatever,
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:27.600]  but iPhone iPad, everything up until 2011 was I whatever. And then everything afterwards I forget
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:34.960]  is. I can't remember if there's literally cloud was, was jobs as last event. And that was the
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:40.000]  introduction of iCloud. So I think, and I think the iCloud is the last product name with the eye
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:45.440]  in front of it. I mean, and whether it's because the people left after he died, didn't like it
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:51.280]  anymore, or I don't think it was quite like Phil Schiller was in there saying the stupid eye names
[02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:55.600]  got to go. This is dumb, Steve. And then he waited until they died or Johnny or whatever,
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:02:01.360]  but maybe it might've been more that Steve was the one who didn't want to put Apple in front
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:06.480]  of everything. I mean, famously, there's a famous story about the original Mac before they come up
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:12.400]  with the Cloverleaf logo for the command key. They were all apples, right? Cause from the Apple,
[02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:18.000]  too, there were two Apple keys. Yeah. Open Apple and closed Apple. Open Apple and closed Apple.
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:24.400]  They're two different, two different Apple keys that were different modifiers, early versions of
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:31.360]  the original system. One had, it was Apple P for print and Apple S for save. And Steve was like,
[02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:36.000]  there's too many Apple logos. We're abusing it. This is supposed to be the Apple logo is precious,
[02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:41.920]  which is kind of right. So there'll be one, just one up in the upper left corner of the Apple menu.
[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:47.760]  That's it. And no more apples. So they had to invent Susan care, came up with the Cloverleaf
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:54.320]  from a, what was it like a park sign and yeah, in Scandinavia, somewhere in Scandinavia. But, you
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:03:01.840]  know, it may be that mindset of, you know, we want to be precious with using Apple was sort of what
[02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:06.080]  kept him on the eye names, but whatever it certainly worked out for them to the point where
[02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:14.000]  people call the Apple watch the eye watch. Exactly. They, they it's true. It's true. And yet now to go
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:21.200]  back to our, our Disney conversation, right. Apple today is not, is, is back to being an iconic brand
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:26.960]  in a way that maybe it lost its way for a while. And now they have, they made a dedicated choice
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:33.120]  to put Apple as the brand name up in the front that like, literally what is the watch that Apple
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:39.840]  makes? It's the Apple watch. Like you don't need another name for it. It's just Apple watch. That's
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:44.080]  all. And, and that's where they are now. And that, that is, they're, they're on top again.
[02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:50.240]  It's hard to imagine from the perspective of today, how broken the Apple brand was in the
[02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:57.760]  nineties, but like it was real broken to the point where the iMac was became like more valuable as
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:06.000]  the iMac than it did as a thing from Apple. And so the iPod. Logically was called iPod and that's
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:12.880]  how they got people to try the Mac again, was to love an iPod so much that they thought, Hey,
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:18.320]  I love this Apple product. Maybe that computer they make, maybe I should try that. I've never
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:23.040]  had one, but maybe I should try it. And they sold so many Macs to people who fell in love with the
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:27.760]  Apple brand because they love their iPod so much. It's just like that in the Apple store, being
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:32.800]  making it easy to try a Mac and see it and see what you could get out of it. That's how the
[02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:38.960]  rehab of that brand happened. It's hard to imagine now, but really they had, they spent a good decade
[02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:47.040]  rehabbing the Apple brand, but now it's on top again. I remember in 2000, 2001, I was living in
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:51.920]  suburban Boston when I worked at barebone software and we used to go, my wife and I would go to the
[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:57.760]  Rockingham mall where there was the closest Apple store. And repeatedly I would hear people say in
[02:04:57.760 --> 02:05:04.560]  the mall, let's go to the iPod store. Yeah, sure. It was, well, obviously not 2000. That would be
[02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:12.160]  2001, but 2001, 2002, I think 2002. Yeah. I lived there till 2002, but that, that all just, yeah,
[02:05:12.160 --> 02:05:17.760]  that, that happened, that happened and the iMac. Yeah. So in the end, like the iMac is funny because
[02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:23.520]  what the iMac represents is not maybe what you think, like, cause it didn't lead to a,
[02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:29.200]  a huge cavalcade of standalone desktops that were what everybody wanted. And it wasn't like
[02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:32.960]  brightly colored computers. Cause after the G3 iMac, they didn't really do brightly colored
[02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:38.640]  computers anymore until the M1, essentially they didn't do that. It didn't even lead to,
[02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:42.400]  it didn't lead to brightly colored pro Macs. They did the one blue one and then they're like, Nope,
[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:46.320]  people don't like it. We're going to make them boring and gray. Like none of those things are
[02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:51.040]  the, are the things that in the long run affected it. It's more like rehabbing the Apple brand,
[02:05:51.040 --> 02:05:56.480]  giving them a cashflow so that they could do OS 10 and ultimately the iPad and then continue on
[02:05:56.480 --> 02:06:03.360]  and like, and the USB, like it's those weird kind of like choices that they made that actually like
[02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:09.520]  are the demarcation line between like before and after those are the places where it made its
[02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:15.360]  biggest impact. Yeah. And it exemplified that Steve Jobs slash now just institutional Apple
[02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:20.960]  mindset of we're not going to ask our users what they want and build based on the polling.
[02:06:20.960 --> 02:06:25.760]  We're going to figure out what they want and, and build that. And nobody was saying,
[02:06:25.760 --> 02:06:31.040]  get rid of all of my AD, all the ADB ports on your exciting new Mac so that none of my existing mice
[02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:35.760]  and keyboards work without a peripheral and replace it with this thing that's brand new.
[02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:39.920]  Nobody was saying that, but it was the right decision. I got a note from somebody who used
[02:06:39.920 --> 02:06:45.600]  to work at Adobe speaking, just calling back to an earlier part of the show and who got to know
[02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:52.880]  John Warnock as a young, young intern at Adobe. You just had the gumption to, to ask to have lunch
[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:59.040]  with John Warnock. And he said, sure. And, and gave him advice and it said, it said, what do you,
[02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:03.360]  what's your top advice? And he said, here's my top advice. Don't ask people what they want,
[02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:10.640]  watch what they do, and then build something based on that. And again, that's the, that the iMac
[02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:17.360]  exemplifies that, right. Nobody was asking for pretty translucent blue plastic, but you know,
[02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:23.040]  people like things that look fun. People like things. And USB has stood the test of time,
[02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:27.680]  right? I mean, the fact is it's like, well, how are we ever, ever, ever going to get out from under
[02:07:28.720 --> 02:07:35.200]  SCSI and max serial and ADB and the floppy drive? How are we ever going to do that? And the answer
[02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:41.040]  was the only way we're going to do it is if we make people adopt the new standard. And so we're
[02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:45.440]  going to just cut them off and Apple does that to this day. Right. I know it frustrates people,
[02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:51.200]  but like, I, I understand the frustration, but I also almost always understand why Apple does it
[02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:55.280]  where they're like, look, look, we could, we could stretch this out, but that doesn't make
[02:07:55.280 --> 02:07:58.960]  anybody happy. It just stretches out the pain. So we're just going to make like, it's a, it's
[02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:02.560]  the dock connectors going away and now it's lightning and that, and then we're about to
[02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:08.000]  enter probably the, Oh, your iPhone doesn't use lightning anymore. It uses USB-C. It's like, okay.
[02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:12.320]  And the Mac don't go into USB-C. It's like, Oh yeah, I know there's pain there. But like
[02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:20.240]  at some point trying to create a long transition, just, just stretches out the pain. And, and
[02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:24.400]  instead of just like, let's do it, let's make the change. And you'll all thank us later.
[02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:28.240]  When you can't imagine going back to the way it was. And the iMac was the most extreme example
[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:34.000]  because 90s Apple was so dysfunctional that they had done nothing to get rid of any of those
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:37.920]  three different peripheral standards that had to be on every Mac. It's like,
[02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:39.920]  let's get it out of here. USB. That's it.
[02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:42.800]  Speaker 2 Let me thank our third and final sponsor of
[02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:46.640]  the show. It's our good friends at Squarespace. I can just tell you right now at the beginning,

[02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:19.360]  domain name registration, the beginning, picking a template, picking the features that you want on
[02:09:19.360 --> 02:09:25.280]  your website. You do it all by drag and drop. They've got the new fluid engine. That's their
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:31.760]  next generation website design system from Squarespace. It's always been easy and always
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:37.680]  been wizzy wig to use that term again, drag and drop where your interface as the owner of a
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:42.560]  Squarespace website, you're building the website, you're dragging features in, you're taking them
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:47.200]  out. It's exactly what you see is what the people who visit your website are going to see, except
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:53.840]  they're just not going to have the ability to tweak the design. The fluid engine takes
[02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:59.120]  everything Squarespace is known for and what they're good at and just makes it way, way better.
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:05.200]  It's just all reimagined drag and drop technology for desktop. You can do it on mobile too, which is
[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:10.240]  a big change and a big addition. So you can actually design your Squarespace website, tweak
[02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:16.720]  it, adjust it, modify it right on your phone. It is terrific. It is a huge success. It just
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:22.160]  Squarespace getting better at what they were already great at. Online store, all of that,
[02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:26.720]  anything you want to sell from products that you want to sell to selling your time,
[02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:32.800]  if you're a consultant or something like that. And you want to book people to sell your time
[02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:39.280]  to people and take the money and organize your schedule, all of that stuff right there.
[02:10:39.280 --> 02:10:44.960]  The payments, flexible templates that you can either choose from the existing template, start
[02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:50.800]  with a template and tweak it or do your own design from the ground up if you have the expertise or
[02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:57.760]  the desire to do it. Analytics built right in with an absolutely terrific, easily understood
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:04.560]  analytics interface. And if you've looked at 98% of analytics dashboards out there, they look like
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:08.240]  airplane cockpits, not Squarespaces, but that doesn't mean they don't give you all the
[02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:13.760]  information you need. It's just actually organized in a sensible, readable, logical,
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:18.560]  oh, I see where my traffic's coming from. I see which parts of the website people are actually
[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:24.560]  going to. Or if you're placing ads on Instagram or something like that, which of the ads, where are
[02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:30.160]  people landing on your website, all of that built in with their analytics. Just a terrific service.

[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:55.040]  Squarespace for their continuing support of the talk show. Last but not least, man, and this is,
[02:11:55.040 --> 02:12:01.920]  man, we could go for another three hours talking about the iPad. You wrote about your using the
[02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:07.760]  iPad as a travel computer. You just were down. Your mom lives in Arizona, I believe, right?
[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:13.360]  Eric Michael Rhodes Yeah. Yeah. Outside of Phoenix. And I went through a period of time when
[02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:18.640]  I tried really hard to not travel with a laptop and just travel with an iPad. I love using my
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:22.960]  iPad. I'm not going to not travel with it without the iPad. I'm going to bring the iPad. But I was
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:27.680]  like, do I really want to bring an iPad and a laptop on this? So I tried very hard and wrote
[02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:32.160]  about it a lot and talked about it for many years to do the, when I go somewhere, I'm just going to
[02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:36.960]  bring the iPad and the magic keyboard case, and I'm going to be able to do my podcasts and write
[02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:40.320]  my articles and I'm going to make it happen. I'm going to figure out a way to make it work.
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:45.360]  And ever since I got an Apple Silicon MacBook Air, basically, I don't do that anymore. I travel
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:51.040]  with both again. I'm back to that. And I was down on a Friday morning at my mom's house thinking I
[02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:55.040]  need to write something. And I, it was taken, literally I was in the shower and I was like,
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:12:58.960]  oh, that's what I could write. I could write about the fact that I'm doing this now,
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:03.520]  is that's what happens. Sometimes you're like, oh, that's a piece. I'm going to write that up.
[02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:07.440]  And, and I, it was really just sort of like trying to close the loop on like, well,
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:14.800]  I tried this so, so hard for so long. Why did I stop trying? And, and I, it has been interpreted,
[02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:19.040]  it was at the top of Hacker News. People were sending me messages on Mastodon. You write about
[02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:22.720]  any of this and you're going to get the people who are like, how dare you, sir. And you're going to
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:28.000]  get the people who are like, why did you even try to use an iPad? Because it's silly. And the truth
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:34.800]  is I, I liked the idea of only traveling with one of those devices. I tried very hard and I have
[02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:40.240]  come to the, the Apple Silicon MacBook Air is so good and it's so small and it, and it's so
[02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:46.960]  flexible. And I decided, as many of our colleagues have done, David Sparks, I think is a really good
[02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:55.840]  example of this. I've decided I'm done trying to push the iPad where Apple doesn't seem to want
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:14:02.320]  it to go. I was pushing it before. And now I think I've just decided I will accept the iPad
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:08.240]  for what it is. I still write articles on my iPad in that keyboard case or in a stand with an
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:15.200]  external keyboard at my, in my kitchen. Like I like it as a change of pace. I like traveling
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:21.600]  with it, but I'm going to stop doing things like, like if I want to use a, like the stream deck
[02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:25.920]  doesn't work with it. And I use that for a lot of automation stuff and it's got shortcuts, which is
[02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:31.120]  great, but it doesn't do like global keyboard shortcuts for automation. So that's a frustration.
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:35.360]  And then the podcasting thing, while I know esoteric because most people aren't podcasters
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:40.720]  is emblematic in a way of like, there is a fundamental thing that I need that the Mac does
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:45.760]  and the iPad just can't do it. And I can work around it, or I can just give up and say,
[02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:52.160]  am I recording a podcast on this trip? I went to Colorado with my family for a family, for an
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:56.560]  event with like all of Lauren's family being there. And I had one podcast to do, and you know what I
[02:14:56.560 --> 02:15:00.720]  did? I brought the MacBook Air and a microphone. I opened the MacBook Air one time, recorded the
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:06.080]  podcast, posted it, closed the MacBook Air, and that was it. But I like, I just decided that was
[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:10.720]  easier. It was just easier to do it that way. So I did it that way. So I, I, for me, it's more like,
[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:19.200]  I, I tried to make the iPad more than it was. And then I realized I should stop, right? I should
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:23.840]  just stop and accept it for what it is. And I love it for what it is. But like, if I want
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:29.760]  flexibility, if I want to be able to do sort of like anything I want to do, I should just have a
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:36.320]  Mac for that because that's what the Mac is great at. It's the most confounding platform in the
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:42.160]  history of computers. It really is. And I used to, I used to roll, I rolled my eyes for years
[02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:48.080]  and even talked to people in iPad product marketing. And I mean, I'm not, I'm not a,
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:55.760]  never, it's always collegial having briefings with, with Apple folks, but renaming iPad OS
[02:15:55.760 --> 02:16:00.000]  instead of just saying that it runs iOS. Cause it really, it's, they're obviously
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:05.680]  siblings in a very tight way, but I'm, I'm down with it. I, I, I agree that it it's,
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:11.120]  it's worth its own name. It is different. It is, it is not a big iPhone, even though it's kind of
[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:21.520]  a big iPhone, right? It makes it so hard to pin. The Mac is, is a PC. It is a full-blown computer,
[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:28.800]  a Unix workstation, when you can compile software on it and you can still do things,
[02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:33.200]  even with the things people worried wouldn't make the transition to Apple Silicon,
[02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:39.440]  like turning off system integrity protection, if you really want to, so that you can go and inspect
[02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:43.840]  and tweak and replace pieces of the system software, you can still do stuff like that.
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:48.640]  Like stuff that nobody in their wildest dreams imagines Apple's ever going to do with the iPad,
[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:54.080]  right? There is no system integrity protection toggle for, for the iPad. And I don't think there
[02:16:54.080 --> 02:17:00.080]  should be. You know what it is, and you know what the iPhone is. It's a phone and yes,
[02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:06.560]  people are frustrated and we'll see what happens with EU seemingly forcing Apple's regulatory hand
[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:12.400]  with sideloading. We'll see where that goes. I know people have been frustrated that you can't,
[02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:19.360]  if you choose, toggle a switch so that you can just install apps from the web if you want,
[02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:27.280]  if you want with, you know, hopefully appropriate warning. But you know what the iPhone is. It still
[02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:32.400]  is very well defined where it fits in people's lives and people can quibble with the design
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:39.600]  decisions Apple have made on where to draw those limits. But the iPad straddles all of it. It is,
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:44.560]  you can look at it and say that it's so close to being Mac like that it should just be more
[02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:53.280]  Mac like, and you can also see that what so many zillions zillions uncountable number of iPad thriving
[02:17:54.160 --> 02:18:00.960]  users who love it just love that it for them really is like a, just a big, big, big,
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:06.240]  maybe even 12.9 inch iPhone. And that's what they love about it.
[02:18:07.280 --> 02:18:12.960]  I think, I think there's so much mixed up here too, because I strongly suspect,
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:21.520]  and I do not have a lot of detail about this, but I strongly suspect that Apple at one point assumed
[02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:25.600]  that they were putting the Mac out to pasture and they were going to do minimal effort on the Mac.
[02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:31.680]  It was going to be a legacy platform and they were going to build the new Mac like platform
[02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:38.800]  on the iPad. That was what they were going to do. And I think they changed direction and they said,
[02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:41.920]  you know what? We're not going to do that. I suspect even it might've been the moment where
[02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:46.000]  they decided they were actually going to do Apple Silicon for the Mac, right? Because they would've
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:49.360]  been very easy for them to put the Mac out to pasture and just kind of take Intel chips and
[02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:54.400]  let it kind of fade away. And I think at some point, and I, I, one day, I hope somebody will
[02:18:54.400 --> 02:19:00.400]  tell me this for, for true, but it feels like Apple went from thinking that the iPad was the
[02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:05.760]  future of computing and that this would be the next generation computing platform, general purpose
[02:19:05.760 --> 02:19:11.680]  to saying, nah, it'll be the Mac. We're going to stick with the Mac and we're going to make,
[02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:15.760]  we're going to import and they did stuff, right? It's like, we're going to do catalyst and we're
[02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:20.640]  going to let Apple Silicon Macs run iPad apps and we're going to do all this stuff. So like
[02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:25.600]  it can pick up the iPad and pieces of the iPad. What we're not going to do is sort of like,
[02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:30.400]  put it on an Island and make the iPad do Mac things. It's more like we're going to let the Mac
[02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:36.000]  be more iPad-y at times, which is why when there's rumors like that rumor that Mark
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:41.440]  Gurman had at one point about like a touchscreen iMac, I started to think if now I believe that
[02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:47.360]  if Apple ever does something that looks like an iPad, but, but does Mac like things, it will
[02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:55.440]  literally be a Mac that has a compatibility mode, not an iPad that has been tricked out with
[02:19:55.440 --> 02:20:00.880]  a terminal, right? I just don't, it feels like that was a place they weren't going. And at some
[02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:05.520]  point they said, we're not going to go there. We're going to keep the iMac or the iPad a little
[02:20:05.520 --> 02:20:13.600]  bit purer and more iPhone-like with more of capability, but like purer and the Mac is where
[02:20:13.600 --> 02:20:20.720]  anything can happen. And like they, I don't know when 2017, 16, I don't know when,
[02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:27.840]  but like the rhetoric changed about the iPad had that Mac round table, you know? Yeah. And then
[02:20:27.840 --> 02:20:31.840]  there was a moment that I'm sure they actually regret now in 2018, where they pointed out that
[02:20:31.840 --> 02:20:37.840]  the iPad pro is faster than 90% of all PC laptops that sold in the last year. Like that. I think
[02:20:37.840 --> 02:20:42.080]  they, I think they regret that because they were like calling it out, like, look at, look at the
[02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:47.680]  computing prowess of the iPad and like, but that's actually not where they're, where they're going.
[02:20:47.680 --> 02:20:51.600]  Because now that's the Apple Silicon argument, but it's not the iPad argument anymore.
[02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:55.600]  Right. And I remember for years, I was never obsessed with benchmarks.
[02:20:56.400 --> 02:21:01.920]  I'm glad that other reviewers are, but it's just not my vein. I'm not good at it and I'm just not
[02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:06.880]  as obsessed with it. But there were a series of years where I remember not just with iPads,
[02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:15.040]  but even iPhones, where I was just fascinated watching Geekbench single core scores approach
[02:21:15.040 --> 02:21:21.280]  high-end MacBook pros. And it was very clear they were going to pass it. It was, it was clear. And I
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:24.800]  remember writing about it and people would be like, you're crazy. There's no way a phone is
[02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:29.200]  ever going to get a better single. And I'm like, look at the, look at the, the, the slope of these
[02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:35.840]  graphs. It is absolutely going to happen. And then it did happen. And yet the back still didn't move.
[02:21:35.840 --> 02:21:41.840]  I think you're right. I remember you talking about this on this show and I've come more around to
[02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:47.680]  your argument. You know, you're obviously more iPad power usury than I am. I mean, it's, it's
[02:21:47.680 --> 02:21:57.200]  obvious from all of your, our combined writing. I, there's something almost broken in my brain,
[02:21:57.200 --> 02:22:03.200]  in the way that my brain is melded with the Mac way of doing certain things. And it would have,
[02:22:03.840 --> 02:22:09.280]  I think, and I think I was in denial about it, to be honest. I think because I would have found it,
[02:22:09.280 --> 02:22:14.160]  if that's the way things had turned out, it would have been much more difficult for me to adjust.
[02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:18.640]  But I think in hindsight, I think it is true. And I don't think it was ever
[02:22:19.600 --> 02:22:26.480]  a spelled out plan. Like this is there's a cohesive roadmap for where, what year
[02:22:26.480 --> 02:22:31.360]  vaguely the Mac will go away and the iPad will grow to replace it. And there will be
[02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:39.040]  the iMac style 27 inch things running iPad OS or whatever, whatever else it would take for the iPad
[02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:48.240]  platform to have fully obviated the Mac. I think it was more vague and it was just sort of like,
[02:22:48.240 --> 02:22:54.560]  like one of those gnomes stealing underpants plans, right? Where it's like, the Mac is old,
[02:22:54.560 --> 02:23:04.960]  right? It dates back to 1984 on the Apple side and 1988 or 89 on the next side. And even Mac OS 10,
[02:23:04.960 --> 02:23:12.880]  by the time the iPad came out, was a decade old. And it's just, I think, just sort of a gut feeling
[02:23:12.880 --> 02:23:20.320]  of something this old should be replaced by something new. And this iPad clearly had so
[02:23:20.320 --> 02:23:24.640]  much potential, right? Just the first one you're looking at and you're like, and as much as that
[02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:31.040]  first one really was just a big iPhone, it's like, this is so rich with potential. I just,
[02:23:31.040 --> 02:23:36.880]  I always say, I just remember that first hands-on for the very first original iPad,
[02:23:36.880 --> 02:23:44.800]  me and Dan Morin were the last two media people who really got, we practically literally got
[02:23:44.800 --> 02:23:50.400]  kicked out of the hands-on area because, and we were over by the one that had the keyboard. Remember
[02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:55.520]  the original keyboard? It was a weird, weird dock. Yeah. And vertical keyboard dock. Yeah. A vertical
[02:23:55.520 --> 02:24:00.640]  keyboard dock. And it's the fact they had the keyboard dock obviously arranged and it was
[02:24:00.640 --> 02:24:05.680]  famously, there were plans until very late in the game that they were going to have two
[02:24:05.680 --> 02:24:11.040]  ports on the iPad, one the long way and one the skinny way. And there'd be two 30 pin connectors
[02:24:11.040 --> 02:24:16.160]  so that you could connect it to the keyboard dock either way. But we were just sitting there
[02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:22.480]  in front of this iPad, which, you know, seemingly we were, I remember talking with Dan about it,
[02:24:22.480 --> 02:24:27.040]  like, it seems like you ought to be able to put it the other way. You know, like we were just like,
[02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:32.160]  this is amazing, right? They have, they always have like a dummy, Johnny Appleseed, 1963
[02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:37.840]  at Mac.com. You could send emails and try everything out. It's like, this is a real computer.
[02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:43.120]  This is not a phone and you hook it up to this keyboard. And they didn't have trackpad support
[02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:48.160]  for almost 10 years, right? Or it was 10 years. But even without it, just reaching out and touching
[02:24:48.160 --> 02:24:54.000]  the screen, it was like, the potential is so rich. And I just feel like it was just like a gut
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:25:01.680]  feeling. Like, of course, this is going to grow to make the Mac seem so old and antiquated that
[02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:07.120]  this will be the bright future. And just like I said, like a gnome's eating underpants, this is
[02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:14.560]  new, the Mac is old, dot, dot, dot, profit. And then when it really came time in the middle of
[02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:22.080]  the teens for that to prove true, and it had to be a cohesive roadmap, I kind of feel like they
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:26.720]  looked at it and are like, there's no, there's no path to get there, right? Like to keep the iPad,
[02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:33.440]  the iPad, we're not going to have a Unix subsystem under the hood that's exposed to users. But
[02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:38.320]  without this Unix subsystem exposed to users under the hood, how in the world is Xcode ever
[02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:42.400]  going to work? How are we going to build their operating systems? Yeah, I don't even want to
[02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:46.800]  say they took their foot off the gas, but it does feel like they recalibrated because I do think
[02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:52.160]  that like, the change that they made to files and adding external display support last year and
[02:25:52.800 --> 02:25:57.520]  stage manager, but also like the magic keyboard and the trackpad support, like they did a lot of
[02:25:57.520 --> 02:26:03.040]  this stuff to make it more Mac-like. And I think the question is, was that part of a more cohesive
[02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:10.400]  strategy to advance the platform or not? I think, I think in the end, what you say is right, which
[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:17.280]  is the Mac going to Apple Silicon, it gains a lot of benefit. It also gains the software platform,
[02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:23.440]  right? Apple Silicon Mac can run if allowed, and that's an issue where a lot of people don't allow
[02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:28.560]  it, but like it will run iPad apps. It just runs them. And it's fine. Like the MLB app just runs
[02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:35.440]  on my Mac and there is not a Mac app for MLB. It just runs on my Mac. And that's great, right? And
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:40.800]  that seems to be what they've decided is we're going to unify instead of unifying, like on iOS,
[02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:45.360]  we're going to keep Mac OS around, but they did the, they did the work to take all the low level
[02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:50.160]  stuff and get it to be aligned across all the platforms. Cause they had both, they drifted
[02:26:50.160 --> 02:26:54.480]  apart and that allowed them to do catalyst, but it also allows them with Apple Silicon to just
[02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:59.280]  run those apps on there. And you can see you're sort of like building up this whole layer,
[02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:04.320]  which is why I said earlier at this point, if I'm Apple and I'm like intrigued by the idea
[02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:09.440]  of something that's more like a convertible laptop, something that could be touch and maybe
[02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:15.520]  thinner. I don't think you would build, like, I don't think there's a facility to build all
[02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:21.920]  that stuff into the iPad. Like the iPad is the iPad. The Mac is the superset. So you would take
[02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:28.080]  the iPad and say, Oh, when you fold the keyboard back, it becomes an iPad. That's what you'd say.
[02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:34.960]  You wouldn't say enter Mac mode on your iPad. You'd say your Mac can be an iPad sometimes,
[02:27:34.960 --> 02:27:40.320]  but it's still a Mac and it runs the same apps on either side. That's how you would,
[02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:43.920]  that's how you would have to do it. And I'm not saying they will do that. I'm just saying that
[02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:49.440]  it's another indicator of my progression of sort of like how I view where Apple is taking
[02:27:49.440 --> 02:27:54.480]  these platforms that I just don't think that Apple is, is looking at the iPad and saying,
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:28:00.240]  one day the iPad will do everything that people look to the Mac to do. And then the Mac won't be
[02:28:00.240 --> 02:28:03.840]  relevant anymore. I just don't think, I don't think they believe that. No, I don't think so
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:11.520]  either. I mean, and one of the tests is for a real computer is can you use the computer to make
[02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:17.280]  software for the computer? Right. And we go back to the original Mac in 1984. You couldn't write
[02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:23.280]  Mac software on an original Mac. You had to have a Lisa. And when the Lisa was, I don't know,
[02:28:23.280 --> 02:28:26.240]  everybody complained that the Mac was too expensive and the Lisa was, I don't know,
[02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:32.080]  like $10,000. And that, that did not last long. Macintosh programmers workshop came out pretty
[02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:36.640]  quickly thereafter. And I never used the Lisa. I don't know about you, but I don't, speaking of
[02:28:36.640 --> 02:28:42.320]  computers I never saw. It didn't take long for the Mac to bootstrap itself, to be able to write
[02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:49.680]  Mac software on a Mac. And Playgrounds feels like it might eventually be essentially an iOS
[02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:54.880]  app only Xcode, right? It could be right there. And there's, you can take like a Playgrounds
[02:28:54.880 --> 02:29:01.440]  project from iPad and import it into Xcode now. And it gets to some of those things with the,
[02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:07.760]  the, the pro AV apps, the logic and final cut. Right. Where now they finally, and I think it was
[02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:14.160]  a justifiable finally, have real professional versions of final cut and logic for the iPad.
[02:29:14.160 --> 02:29:21.120]  And you can, which one, one's more of a, the final cut is more of a subset of, on the Mac,
[02:29:21.120 --> 02:29:25.680]  but you can still go from the iPad to the Mac, even if you can't always go from the Mac back
[02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:32.320]  to the iPad. And Playgrounds is sorta like that, but even then it's only for making iPad style
[02:29:32.320 --> 02:29:38.320]  apps, right? Like you can't imagine writing Mac apps and Apple doesn't just write apps on the Mac.
[02:29:38.320 --> 02:29:43.360]  They write the operating systems, they write the firmware for them. What computers do you think
[02:29:43.360 --> 02:29:48.160]  write the firmware that runs the AirPod Pro 2 noise cancellation? They do that on the Mac,
[02:29:48.720 --> 02:29:55.280]  right? You'd have to be able to write all that software. But it's, it just, I, I, I do, I think
[02:29:55.280 --> 02:30:03.600]  I, I kind of feel like in the early PC era, platforms came and went every couple of years.
[02:30:03.600 --> 02:30:09.760]  Nothing, if you were lucky, if you got a full generation, like the Commodore 64, which had,
[02:30:09.760 --> 02:30:16.640]  I don't know, six or seven years of prime time life and things like the Apple 2 platform had
[02:30:17.440 --> 02:30:24.880]  over a decade long run of relevance, but then went away and it was just understood that platforms
[02:30:24.880 --> 02:30:32.720]  died after a decade or so replaced by something new. And the Mac and windows were these two
[02:30:33.280 --> 02:30:40.480]  things that came out of that era and seemingly had instead of a decade, decades. But I still think
[02:30:40.480 --> 02:30:43.840]  a lot of people of our generations just sort of had an assumption, but they're going to come to
[02:30:43.840 --> 02:30:48.960]  an end eventually, right? Then we're not going to be using Macs forever, but I kind of feel now
[02:30:48.960 --> 02:30:55.200]  we are. I, I don't, I don't foresee in, I think 25 years from now, there's still going to be a Mac.
[02:30:55.840 --> 02:30:59.200]  I really do at this point. I wouldn't have said that 10 or 15 years ago.
[02:31:00.800 --> 02:31:10.720]  The, when I talked to Phil Schiller, maybe the last time I did a one-on-one with Phil Schiller
[02:31:10.720 --> 02:31:19.360]  was for the 25th anniversary of the Mac, I think. And it was Phil and Jaws and I forget who else
[02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:28.240]  was in, was there, but it was a time where I basically said, do you foresee the Mac kind of
[02:31:28.240 --> 02:31:34.480]  fading away with these other products there? And he could have done the PR thing, right? And I'll,
[02:31:34.480 --> 02:31:39.840]  what he said was the Mac goes on forever. That's what he said. The Mac goes on forever.
[02:31:39.840 --> 02:31:47.200]  Not you never know. It was the Mac goes on forever. And I think about that from time to time,
[02:31:47.200 --> 02:31:51.600]  because there was a moment where I, like I said, I was like, I'm not sure the Mac goes on forever.
[02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:57.200]  And now I think maybe the Mac goes on forever. I think maybe that is essentially that, that either
[02:31:57.200 --> 02:32:05.920]  that or the iPad and Apple's platforms and the vision pro and all of that will evolve and keep
[02:32:05.920 --> 02:32:12.800]  evolving at this pace where at some point then there will be that more natural death where you'll
[02:32:12.800 --> 02:32:19.440]  realize that actually everything I use my Mac for now, I can do on those systems. And they've
[02:32:19.440 --> 02:32:24.320]  evolved to the point where it's irrelevant that the, right. Cause like, it's very rare that a
[02:32:24.320 --> 02:32:27.440]  thing that you love, you're talking about when Apple was maybe going out of business and we're
[02:32:27.440 --> 02:32:32.480]  all horrified by it. It's very rare that a thing that is used and loved is just the plug is pulled
[02:32:32.480 --> 02:32:37.520]  while everybody's using it. And they scream, right? What happens is what happens is it becomes
[02:32:37.520 --> 02:32:43.920]  irrelevant. So when it finally dies, nobody cares anymore, except collectors and some aficionados,
[02:32:43.920 --> 02:32:48.480]  but like everybody else has sort of moved on. So it's like, I can't imagine like when I stopped
[02:32:48.480 --> 02:32:53.680]  using a TiVo, it was like, Oh, I love TiVo. I did. But by the time I dumped my TiVo, it was
[02:32:53.680 --> 02:32:58.240]  irrelevant because everything was streaming at that point. And I had given, I wasn't using it
[02:32:58.240 --> 02:33:03.680]  anymore. That's the more likely tech irrelevance for the Mac would be that all these other Apple
[02:33:03.680 --> 02:33:07.600]  platforms have reached the point where you don't need the Mac. Oh, they all do all those things.
[02:33:07.600 --> 02:33:11.360]  It turns out that I'm not using the Mac for those things anymore. And that's when it ends.
[02:33:11.360 --> 02:33:16.000]  I still use a TiVo, but that's really, we'd have to get my wife on to explain why I could,
[02:33:16.560 --> 02:33:21.680]  I could switch to doing everything through the Apple TV box, but I pod would be a perfect
[02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:26.400]  example of that, right? There were no riots when Apple sold the last iPod. I mean, again,
[02:33:26.400 --> 02:33:30.640]  because it had become irrelevant by that deep, deep, deep affinity for some of the models,
[02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:35.280]  people collect them and people love them. And, and there's a part I know. And I know the,
[02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:40.560]  the oddest one was the hard drive based ones that had the biggest storage, right? Because they were
[02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:45.760]  like professional DJs who were like, I need to store like 80 gigabytes of music on a thing. And
[02:33:45.760 --> 02:33:50.640]  I used to show up at a wedding with this pack of cards. And now what am I supposed to do again? I
[02:33:50.640 --> 02:33:55.920]  got to take a whole laptop. But yeah, it, I think people sort of had that idea. And I think, I think
[02:33:55.920 --> 02:34:00.640]  the Mac is, is I really do. I think it's here forever. I think it has a longer future than the
[02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:05.760]  iPad ahead of it. I really do. You mentioned vision pro last thing I want. I'm so glad you
[02:34:05.760 --> 02:34:10.480]  did. Cause the one thing I wanted to mention was talking about this for travel and framing it in
[02:34:10.480 --> 02:34:16.160]  the perspective of, well, what do you put in your backpack or your briefcase to go on a trip? Right?
[02:34:16.160 --> 02:34:22.480]  Do you take the iPad and the Mac book? To me, that's the thing that the, the elephant in the
[02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:31.440]  room is the vision headsets. And I I'd say just vision headsets because there's clearly the $3,500
[02:34:31.440 --> 02:34:36.000]  vision pro that comes out early next year is not the only one that's going to exist.
[02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:42.560]  Let's blast fast forward three or four years and there's a vision non-pro that's only $1,500 or
[02:34:42.560 --> 02:34:50.080]  whatever. And it is, it turns out that as I think is going to be true, it's going to be a phenomenal
[02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:56.320]  device to use while you're sitting on an airplane or a train and a phenomenal device to sit at a
[02:34:56.320 --> 02:35:04.880]  hotel room at a desk and sort of catch up on stuff on a virtual big screen. One thing about
[02:35:04.880 --> 02:35:10.000]  if you're taking a Mac book, especially a Mac book air, but you know, even if it's a Mac book pro
[02:35:11.040 --> 02:35:18.000]  and an iPad with you, they both pack flat. And yes, it is. I, I, I don't know why I obsessed
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:23.440]  over the extra weight of my 11 inch iPad, but I do. And I think I should leave it at home,
[02:35:23.440 --> 02:35:28.080]  save my shoulders, a little bit of wear and tear. The vision pro I think is something or vision
[02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:33.680]  headsets is something I'm going to want to take with me on most trips. If it's like overnight
[02:35:33.680 --> 02:35:40.480]  length, maybe not like a day trip to New York, but overnight type trips is inherently going to
[02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:46.320]  be a pain in the ass to travel with packing wise, right? Because no matter you saw it in person,
[02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:52.080]  and even if for everybody out there listening who still hasn't seen one in person, let alone tried
[02:35:52.080 --> 02:35:57.600]  one, it's, you know, you can just look at it. It doesn't pack flat. So where do you put it? It's,
[02:35:57.600 --> 02:36:03.600]  it's like taking a big over the ear head headphones instead of just earbuds. It's
[02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:10.480]  takes some strategy. There's no way I feel like that's a breaking point for the,
[02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:15.440]  Hey, do I take my iPad and Mac book? If you're also going to take a vision pro,
[02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:18.960]  all of a sudden now it's like, what am I taking a whole Apple store with me?
[02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:26.160]  Yeah. And, and what it sounds like, basically you'd be able to run anything you'd run on your iPad
[02:36:26.160 --> 02:36:31.840]  on a vision pro, but vision pro at least this initial version, the way it does its
[02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:37.760]  Mac compatibility is it is doing screen sharing. So you would, what basically you'd bring up,
[02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:41.840]  you'd have to bring a Mac with you. I do wonder in the long run, and this goes back to the iPad
[02:36:41.840 --> 02:36:48.640]  as well. Like I do wonder at some point if Apple says, you know what Mac, the, the ultimate solution
[02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:55.680]  to the Mac iOS is that is emulation is a virtual machine or virtualization. And that, that first
[02:36:55.680 --> 02:37:02.960]  off M M two iPad pro, like it could run Mac iOS in a virtual machine if it wanted to. And that
[02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:07.520]  would be the answer to my iPad is not as functional as the Mac would be. We'll just run
[02:37:07.520 --> 02:37:12.400]  Mac iOS on it when you want to, and then you got it and it's not a Mac, but it'll, it'll virtualize
[02:37:12.400 --> 02:37:19.760]  it. I don't know if Apple will ever do that, but when I look at the vision pro, I think surely
[02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:26.560]  they're not going to say you always must bring a Mac with you in order to use Mac software. I surely
[02:37:26.560 --> 02:37:34.240]  the long game there is that it can be a Mac too, right? Just running again in virtualization,
[02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:40.480]  Apple Silicon, it's all the same. And that would be really interesting if I didn't have to
[02:37:40.480 --> 02:37:46.400]  bring a Mac book air with me, literally just so that I could open it up and then have it pop up
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:53.520]  into the vision. And with 10 more years, just to pick an even number of increases in performance
[02:37:53.520 --> 02:38:01.040]  and Apple Silicon CPU, single core multi-core 10 more years of the natural expansion of
[02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:07.760]  levels of RAM and memory and what's available, what a, what the computer in one of these devices
[02:38:07.760 --> 02:38:15.840]  can do in its spare cycles. Like you said, if an iPad could already clearly, if Apple technically
[02:38:15.840 --> 02:38:24.000]  allowed it, run a virtualized Mac OS, well, it's clearly vision pro probably could right now.
[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:30.000]  And if not, it certainly will within a handful of years, let alone 10 years. So I could see
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:37.440]  that I could see a future where the forever Mac is purely software. I really it's a virtual,
[02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:43.200]  it's a virtual machine that can run sort of wherever you want. And, and, and that yeah,
[02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:49.840]  I, I have that thought too, that, that in the end, like every now and then I see people like
[02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:53.280]  version writers really like to write about that Samsung decks thing where you plug a Samsung
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:57.680]  phone into a monitor and it's sort of a weird desktop computer. And it's like, in the grand
[02:38:57.680 --> 02:39:03.840]  scheme of things, I'll use a 10 years out, or is it unreasonable that every Apple product can be
[02:39:03.840 --> 02:39:09.840]  any Apple product? If you, if you put it in the right context, maybe, and vision pro seems to be
[02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:15.520]  especially the product that could do that, right? Where it's sort of like, it is a virtual reality
[02:39:15.520 --> 02:39:22.080]  product. So if you say, I want a Mac right here on this empty desk in the long run, shouldn't
[02:39:22.080 --> 02:39:27.120]  vision pro be able to put a Mac on that empty desk? I think it should right in the, in the end,
[02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:32.800]  and it'll, if it's, if it's all virtualized inside Apple Silicon, I don't see why not,
[02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:38.880]  other than wanting to sell a vision pro user an additional Mac. But you know, I don't know in
[02:39:38.880 --> 02:39:42.080]  the end, if that's the right thing for the product to do, I think Apple will let it do.
[02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:49.760]  Yeah, I do too. And I think, and I think it gets around a lot of the I don't know how to
[02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:55.760]  describe them, but the objections that Apple has internally to allowing Mac like things on
[02:39:55.760 --> 02:40:01.360]  iPhones and iPads and whatever, that they're not going to let give you Unix subsystem access to
[02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:06.960]  the actual file system on an iPad or iPhone. But if it's all virtualized, it's just in an app.
[02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:11.040]  It's not, you'd still have Unix, you'd still have all the command line stuff you want,
[02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:17.200]  but you'd only be diddling with the virtual internals of the virtual Mac with no access
[02:40:17.200 --> 02:40:23.600]  or connection to the actual literal physical computer that this is running on. And that
[02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:32.400]  satisfies Apple's design goals for keeping these generations of devices newer than the Mac
[02:40:33.520 --> 02:40:38.960]  completely sealed off from the user being able to touch them for four good reasons,
[02:40:38.960 --> 02:40:46.080]  but with bad trade-offs. There are reasons both ways, but virtualizing it solves those problems.
[02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:49.040]  It really does. So I kind of feel like that's the ultimate solution.
[02:40:49.040 --> 02:40:52.880]  Yeah. And I certainly would love, I mean, that would solve my travel problem. If I could just
[02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:56.960]  a virtual machine of Mac iOS on an iPad when I need it and then shut it back down again,
[02:40:56.960 --> 02:41:01.040]  I'm not saying they will do that, but well, that would solve a lot of my problems. If I brought a,
[02:41:01.040 --> 02:41:06.800]  if I'm bringing a keyboard and trackpad case along with me anyway, I could, I could fake it in a Mac
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:12.400]  app for a while and then just get rid of it and go back to using my iPad. But there are all those
[02:41:12.400 --> 02:41:16.080]  arguments are like, why don't, but they they'll sell me both. So they make more money. It's like,
[02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:19.360]  yeah, I know in the short term, but in the long term, I think it's worth thinking about that
[02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:24.000]  moment where like all these Apple platforms are all capable of running virtually on all,
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:28.560]  it's all the same hardware essentially, right? Like a MacBook air and an iPad pro that are
[02:41:28.560 --> 02:41:32.880]  running them too. They are not that different. Those two computers are not very different.
[02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:36.480]  And so at that point, you could almost mix and match and just say like, run,
[02:41:36.480 --> 02:41:41.840]  run, whatever, wherever. And, and the vision pro of all of them is like every,
[02:41:41.840 --> 02:41:46.720]  I think everything will be virtualizable inside the vision pro eventually. Cause that's the whole
[02:41:46.720 --> 02:41:52.320]  point of it is just create a, it's not hardware, it's virtual hardware on demand. I would think
[02:41:52.320 --> 02:41:57.520]  that it would definitely get there in the next 10 years. Right. And actually turns the portable
[02:41:57.520 --> 02:42:02.720]  Mac experience into something superior because even right now, I mean, again, we did not get
[02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:12.080]  to try the Mac virtual display in the demos they gave out at WWDC, but talking to people at Apple
[02:42:12.080 --> 02:42:17.440]  who've used it, it is by their accounts, not like marketing people, but engineering type people,
[02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:23.920]  it's really good and usable and credible on this first generation one, three quarters of a year
[02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:30.000]  before it actually ships. Future ones, it's going to be great, but you'll have not just a 4k display
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:35.600]  like this one's promising, but you know, six or eight K displays eventually. No problem. Right.
[02:42:35.600 --> 02:42:39.840]  I mean, there's no doubt in my mind that like a five year from now vision pro is going to be able
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:45.760]  to simulate like a giant eight K display in front of you that if it, and if it's the only thing you
[02:42:45.760 --> 02:42:51.200]  take in your backpack, wow, now you're traveling lighter, I guess, except for the battery packs,
[02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:56.560]  you'll need to take me out. Sure. But you know, still you'll probably save, it's probably going
[02:42:56.560 --> 02:43:02.800]  to weigh less than a MacBook pro, but you'll have a giant virtual display. So the future is bright,
[02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:09.200]  but I do think that it will in the near term next year and the year after it's, it's definitely
[02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:15.200]  going to change people's, Hey, what do I take with me when I go on this trip? I think you're right.
[02:43:15.200 --> 02:43:20.320]  I, I, and I don't know what my answer to that is. No, I don't want, I don't know what mine will be
[02:43:20.320 --> 02:43:24.080]  either. It's just one of those things where I'm like, well, I need to, I need to actually have
[02:43:24.080 --> 02:43:29.920]  one and live with it. I can't just go by marketing materials or a pack can 30 minute demo. I love
[02:43:29.920 --> 02:43:34.640]  that I got to have it. I love to talk about it. I still think about it. It kind of haunts me that I
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:40.560]  only got those sweet, sweet 30 minutes with it, but I don't draw any conclusions from it. It's
[02:43:40.560 --> 02:43:46.000]  everything is different when you use it for real. Anyway, Jason, it's always good to have you on,
[02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:50.400]  even if it's a brief show like this one. Yeah, they can't all be marathons. Sometimes we got
[02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:57.200]  to cut it short, certain sweet tight and bright. We got, we, we it's like Bob Barker got to 99.
[02:43:57.200 --> 02:44:02.160]  Didn't go over. We got to buy my count here, two 52, but we didn't go over the three minute mark.
[02:44:02.160 --> 02:44:08.000]  So we win. Yeah. This isn't like, this is Marco Arment or star Wars talk here. We don't go over
[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:12.080]  three hours. That's the, forget that we're staying right under there. Tight and bright.
[02:44:13.600 --> 02:44:17.120]  Do you remember as a kid, you go back to the prices, right? With the, in the, in the showcase
[02:44:17.120 --> 02:44:21.840]  showdown, when you got to be the fourth person and you you'd have the lucky option. If you thought
[02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:26.640]  everybody else overbid, you could go one dollar, one dollar. And remember when you knew that that
[02:44:26.640 --> 02:44:31.840]  was obviously the right strategy and then somebody wouldn't do it, screaming at the television.
[02:44:33.120 --> 02:44:37.120]  I mean, I have that when nobody knows the answer on final jeopardy and it's exactly the same
[02:44:37.120 --> 02:44:41.520]  feeling, right? It was just like, come on guys, come on. How is it that I know this and you don't
[02:44:41.520 --> 02:44:46.560]  right. I would have zero chance of winning on jeopardy or qualifying on jeopardy. I'm way
[02:44:46.560 --> 02:44:51.120]  I think way too slowly and I don't even know enough trivia, but whatever trivia I know,
[02:44:51.120 --> 02:44:57.200]  I don't, I'm not fast. Like our friend Glenn, who actually is jeopardy player champion,
[02:44:57.200 --> 02:45:01.920]  champion winner. But when I know the answer, I know it's bad. If they don't know it,
[02:45:02.880 --> 02:45:07.760]  it doesn't make me angry. Anyway. Thank you, Jason. Everybody of course can follow you
[02:45:07.760 --> 02:45:13.360]  at six colors.com. And you always, even when you do write at unusual places like the verge
[02:45:13.360 --> 02:45:19.680]  or your weekly regular Mac world column, it's always linked to from six colors, right? The
[02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:26.400]  upgrade with Mike Hurley, fantastic podcasts, always, always worn out episodes on my podcast
[02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:32.480]  player and the incomparable network, chock full of pop culture. Goodness. What else do,
[02:45:32.480 --> 02:45:37.200]  what else do you have? Those are the, I think biggest highlights. I believe it or not,
[02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:42.000]  I'm actually on Mac break weekly with Leo Laporte every Tuesday with Andy and Iko,
[02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:46.480]  who I have been working with for like 30 years now. So it's kind of fun to hang out with those.
[02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:49.520]  I don't understand how you do it. I don't understand. I don't understand.
[02:45:50.160 --> 02:45:54.720]  I don't know either. I just don't think about it. It's like violet coyote. You just run off
[02:45:54.720 --> 02:46:01.200]  the edge of the cliff and don't look down at me. I'm a looker downer. That's thank you, Jason.
[02:46:01.200 --> 02:46:12.240]  Thanks, John.
