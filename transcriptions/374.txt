[00:00.000 --> 00:03.600]  I know you do a podcast entirely about superhero movies.
[00:03.600 --> 00:06.480]  I do. That's shows and comic books.
[00:06.480 --> 00:10.560]  That's the Biff show, which we mentioned a lot of times at the end of the show.
[00:10.560 --> 00:11.600]  I'll mention it up front.
[00:14.320 --> 00:16.880]  You do that with Guy and Dan, thank you, too.
[00:16.880 --> 00:22.960]  Our good friends Guy English and Dan Morin, the successful novelist in our crew.
[00:22.960 --> 00:25.120]  Yeah, who's finally been on your show now.
[00:25.120 --> 00:26.880]  Yeah, yeah. It was fantastic.
[00:26.880 --> 00:27.760]  He was thrilled.
[00:27.760 --> 00:30.240]  Well, what an idiot I am for waiting, because he's great.
[00:30.240 --> 00:33.200]  But anyway, I thought about you. I don't know what happened.
[00:33.200 --> 00:34.800]  Who knows? Could have been an edible.
[00:37.680 --> 00:40.720]  I hear that a lot. People think edibles, and they think about me.
[00:40.720 --> 00:46.000]  Somehow, two nights ago, I wanted to watch something.
[00:46.000 --> 00:50.320]  Amy was asleep on the couch with me, so I had free choice to pick a movie
[00:50.320 --> 00:52.960]  that maybe she would have said, that's stupid, I don't want to watch that.
[00:54.560 --> 00:55.600]  That's how you thought about me.
[00:55.600 --> 00:58.960]  Well, what I saw in the menu, I'm just surfing for movies,
[00:58.960 --> 01:05.920]  and I saw Richard Donner's cut of Superman II, and I still don't think I've seen it.
[01:06.640 --> 01:12.800]  But I've heard the stories that they, I think, and you probably know this more than I do
[01:12.800 --> 01:18.720]  encyclopedic-wise, but more or less, when they decided to make Superman in 1979,
[01:18.720 --> 01:21.520]  and they had a big budget, and they got Marlon Brando,
[01:22.160 --> 01:25.200]  they spent half the budget on getting Marlon Brando,
[01:25.200 --> 01:26.800]  getting Brando for 20 minutes,
[01:27.680 --> 01:32.640]  and shot with the idea that this is going to be a hit, we're going to make sequels,
[01:32.640 --> 01:35.760]  and they shot parts of Superman II with it.
[01:35.760 --> 01:39.440]  They shot more than a movie, and while we've got all these,
[01:39.440 --> 01:42.560]  Gene Hackman and all these actors, Ned Beatty, a great cast,
[01:42.560 --> 01:46.400]  and they shot all of this, and then something happened with the producers,
[01:46.400 --> 01:50.320]  where Richard Donner had a falling out before they got to Superman II.
[01:50.320 --> 01:52.720]  Somebody else came in and shot half the movie,
[01:52.720 --> 01:55.120]  and it kind of explains why Superman II is weird.
[01:55.120 --> 01:56.960]  But I haven't seen Superman II in years.
[01:56.960 --> 01:58.800]  Now, am I right so far?
[01:58.800 --> 02:00.160]  I think as far as I know, yes.
[02:00.160 --> 02:01.600]  Yeah, and I'm not Super II.
[02:01.600 --> 02:04.720]  I know that they shot a lot of it at the same time,
[02:04.720 --> 02:06.000]  and I know that there was a falling out.
[02:06.560 --> 02:07.920]  I don't know a lot more than that.
[02:07.920 --> 02:14.160]  It kind of explains why Superman I has the bad guys from Superman II in it,
[02:14.160 --> 02:16.240]  which I remember now as a kid.
[02:16.240 --> 02:19.200]  Yeah, because they're teased at the beginning of that movie.
[02:19.200 --> 02:23.360]  Yeah, so anyway, what I was thinking two nights ago was,
[02:23.920 --> 02:26.160]  I was enticed by this Richard Donner cut,
[02:27.440 --> 02:28.240]  but I thought, you know what?
[02:28.240 --> 02:31.520]  I haven't seen the first Superman in forever.
[02:31.520 --> 02:32.080]  I don't know.
[02:32.080 --> 02:35.680]  Maybe when my son, who's now finishing up freshman year of college,
[02:35.680 --> 02:37.120]  was a toddler.
[02:37.120 --> 02:38.480]  I mean, it was a long time.
[02:39.120 --> 02:41.200]  So I thought, let's watch Superman, and I put it on.
[02:42.400 --> 02:44.720]  Wow, what a weird, weird movie.
[02:44.720 --> 02:47.120]  Have you seen the Superman movie?
[02:47.120 --> 02:48.000]  The 1970?
[02:48.000 --> 02:48.800]  Oh, my God.
[02:48.800 --> 02:55.120]  Yeah, honestly, I still think that it's the perfect superhero movie, honestly.
[02:55.120 --> 02:55.840]  I really do.
[02:55.840 --> 02:59.840]  I mean, it's very dated now, and certainly it's dated in terms of the special effects,
[02:59.840 --> 03:03.440]  and there's a lot of hilarious 70s-isms in there,
[03:03.440 --> 03:08.320]  but in terms of nailing the character, I think it's perfect.
[03:08.320 --> 03:20.960]  I guess what I'm trying to say is it is a very bad movie, but it is very bad in the
[03:20.960 --> 03:21.840]  perfect ways.
[03:23.360 --> 03:30.880]  The movie did go down like butter, and I've got the goddamn score stuck in my head now
[03:30.880 --> 03:33.600]  for 48 hours consecutively.
[03:33.600 --> 03:39.280]  There's, in the back of my head, whatever part of my brain gets song stuck in it, it
[03:39.280 --> 03:43.040]  is the absolutely amazing John Williams Superman score.
[03:44.080 --> 03:48.480]  But I'm going to assume for people out there listening, I don't want to spend tons of time
[03:48.480 --> 03:49.040]  on Superman.
[03:49.600 --> 03:50.880]  We're not spoiling this.
[03:51.680 --> 03:56.560]  I mean, you've had your chance to see the movie, but some of the things that are so
[03:56.560 --> 04:06.960]  weird, there's a scene, number one, the whole preface to the movie on Krypton, or as Marlon
[04:06.960 --> 04:10.160]  Brando calls it, Krypton, I'm not quite sure.
[04:11.600 --> 04:17.440]  Do we go with Brando's line read, or do we go with what everybody else in the world says?
[04:17.440 --> 04:19.280]  For 80 years of comic books.
[04:19.280 --> 04:27.280]  But once you get to Metropolis and adult Clark Kent is joining the Daily Planet, and Lois
[04:27.280 --> 04:34.400]  Lane is already the star reporter, and the big story in town is there's this Superman
[04:34.400 --> 04:37.200]  who's suddenly arrived and is solving crimes and stuff, right?
[04:37.200 --> 04:40.400]  And that premise was obvious, right?
[04:40.400 --> 04:41.200]  I mean, I don't know.
[04:41.200 --> 04:45.680]  I think they could make this movie a thousand different ways, and at some point, that's
[04:45.680 --> 04:46.560]  the setup, right?
[04:46.560 --> 04:50.720]  Yeah, Clark Kent, nude to the paper, Superman, nude to the town.
[04:51.360 --> 04:57.600]  There's a scene where Clark and Lois leave the paper, and they're like walking around
[04:57.600 --> 05:05.520]  a corner, and they get mugged, and a mugger is there with a gun, and I don't know what
[05:05.520 --> 05:11.600]  he's asking for her jewelry or a purse or something, and Clark is, we know he's Superman,
[05:11.600 --> 05:20.320]  and he bungles the scenario such that the mugger fires the gun at Lois Lane from about
[05:20.320 --> 05:26.560]  two feet away, right at her face, and he catches the bullet in fast motion and falls down,
[05:26.560 --> 05:29.840]  and the guy, he didn't really want to murder her.
[05:29.840 --> 05:34.400]  He was, it just was a bungled, you know, everybody got nervous, and as they say in Goodfellas,
[05:34.400 --> 05:35.200]  the gun went off.
[05:35.200 --> 05:42.080]  Lois doesn't know any better because he pushed her aside, but how reckless is that?
[05:42.080 --> 05:44.640]  That is so crazy that you...
[05:44.640 --> 05:50.560]  Well, I think the idea is that, well, I mean, part of the idea is he is both of those characters,
[05:50.560 --> 05:50.720]  right?
[05:50.720 --> 05:51.120]  Right.
[05:51.120 --> 05:55.680]  He's Superman, he's pretty cool, he's confident, but he's also Clark Kent, and he's a guy
[05:55.680 --> 05:59.440]  who was raised in Kansas, and he's new to the city.
[05:59.440 --> 06:06.720]  Like, he doesn't get what's going on, and similarly, how he ends up going to confront
[06:06.720 --> 06:11.680]  Lex Luthor and assumes that he's on top of the situation, and now Luthor's got him back
[06:11.680 --> 06:14.640]  on his heels, and he should have known that from the beginning.
[06:14.640 --> 06:14.960]  Right.
[06:14.960 --> 06:16.720]  He's a bit of a rube, right?
[06:16.720 --> 06:16.960]  Right.
[06:16.960 --> 06:23.520]  Because he's just starting out, and I think it kind of fits in a way.
[06:23.520 --> 06:30.080]  I mean, yeah, it is dumb, but he's not necessarily, I mean, I think that's part of, because he's
[06:30.080 --> 06:37.040]  so super-powered, obviously, he has to have some sort of flaw, and his flaw is naivete.
[06:37.040 --> 06:38.000]  Naivete, yeah.
[06:39.280 --> 06:42.800]  It works, but it is, when you really think about it, it's ridiculous.
[06:42.800 --> 06:49.440]  And I guess that the premise is that he's so good at, his Superman abilities are so
[06:49.440 --> 06:57.680]  unbelievable that catching a bullet fired two feet of somebody is an easy catch for
[06:57.680 --> 07:03.520]  him, so it wasn't really putting her at risk, but it seems like you're putting somebody
[07:03.520 --> 07:08.480]  at crazy risk just to protect your super identity.
[07:08.480 --> 07:10.320]  It's some of the other things.
[07:10.320 --> 07:11.920]  He makes it up to her later.
[07:11.920 --> 07:13.280]  He turns time back and saves her.
[07:13.280 --> 07:21.040]  I think one of the things that the movie did perfectly, and it explains the sort of, for
[07:21.040 --> 07:25.360]  lack of a better word, lots of stupidness, but who cares, let's make the stupidness
[07:25.360 --> 07:25.760]  short.
[07:25.760 --> 07:32.000]  Like, how does intergalactic space travel work in the Superman universe?
[07:32.880 --> 07:38.960]  You just send a little satellite that looks like a Christmas decoration into the orbit,
[07:38.960 --> 07:44.480]  and it looks like it's moving at the speed like our satellites move, and two years later
[07:44.480 --> 07:45.040]  it's at Earth.
[07:45.600 --> 07:46.240]  Yeah, okay.
[07:47.600 --> 07:49.840]  That part is not really germane to the Superman.
[07:49.840 --> 07:53.440]  It's part of the Superman story, I guess, but it's not what you want to concentrate
[07:53.440 --> 07:54.000]  on.
[07:54.000 --> 07:58.000]  But if you really do think about it, again, and these are the thoughts pouring through
[07:58.000 --> 07:59.440]  my head, how stupid is this?
[07:59.440 --> 08:09.360]  So Superman's father, Jor-El, he's both a leading politician and scientist, slash
[08:09.360 --> 08:13.520]  statesman on Krypton, sort of like a Ben Franklin type, I guess.
[08:14.240 --> 08:19.040]  He's the only one who, everybody knows the story, figures out that the planet is doomed,
[08:19.040 --> 08:24.480]  everybody else goes into denial, and for some reason, instead of rescuing the whole family,
[08:24.480 --> 08:29.040]  they decide to just send the toddler son all by himself to planet Earth.
[08:29.040 --> 08:37.440]  And somehow, through their observations and advanced science, he already knows all of
[08:37.440 --> 08:42.560]  the superpowers young Kal-El, Superman, will have on the planet.
[08:42.560 --> 08:45.440]  All right, and knows that he'll look right, right?
[08:46.240 --> 08:47.120]  Do they explain it?
[08:47.120 --> 08:48.000]  It's like Star Trek.
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.520]  Why does everybody look like a human with a different decoration on their forehead?
[08:51.520 --> 08:52.160]  Yeah, yeah.
[08:52.800 --> 08:53.520]  Don't explain it.
[08:54.320 --> 08:55.280]  That's the way it is, right?
[08:55.280 --> 09:02.480]  So he looks like a typical white male human and has these powers.
[09:03.600 --> 09:07.120]  All right, let's just concede that all of that makes sense.
[09:07.120 --> 09:15.280]  But in his other role, in addition to forecasting doom of the planet, he's also leading the
[09:15.280 --> 09:27.440]  trial to incarcerate three super criminals on Krypton who apparently attempted a, what
[09:27.440 --> 09:28.320]  do you call it?
[09:28.320 --> 09:28.880]  Coup or...
[09:28.880 --> 09:31.920]  Yeah, coup or a, what do we call January 6th?
[09:31.920 --> 09:33.280]  We have a word for it.
[09:33.280 --> 09:33.840]  Insurrection.
[09:33.840 --> 09:34.960]  Insurrection.
[09:34.960 --> 09:36.320]  They led an insurrection.
[09:36.320 --> 09:38.000]  I can't believe I forgot the word insurrection.
[09:38.560 --> 09:44.080]  Also, I can't believe that now you and I can talk about our recent insurrection.
[09:44.080 --> 09:44.880]  Yeah, yeah.
[09:44.880 --> 09:47.920]  What's the, what's the one we have experience with?
[09:48.720 --> 09:51.200]  Well, we've also got, I was thinking about this too.
[09:51.200 --> 09:55.840]  We've also, you and I growing up when we did, we've also, it's moving in much slower
[09:55.840 --> 09:58.560]  motion than a massive explosion.
[09:58.560 --> 10:05.200]  But we do kind of have the scientists telling us that the planet is in trouble and everybody
[10:05.200 --> 10:07.360]  else going, ah, yeah.
[10:09.120 --> 10:09.280]  Yeah.
[10:09.280 --> 10:14.160]  I mean, after thousands and thousands of years of people thinking that the Armageddon was
[10:14.160 --> 10:19.040]  right around the door, that the second coming was about to happen and the whole world was
[10:19.040 --> 10:21.760]  going to end, it could actually be happening on our watch.
[10:22.560 --> 10:24.720]  But anyway, he leads their trial.
[10:24.720 --> 10:29.760]  They're, they're convicted by the, these weird people.
[10:29.760 --> 10:31.440]  Only Marlon Brando is there in person.
[10:31.440 --> 10:36.320]  The other ones are all on a big screen Zoom call, right?
[10:36.320 --> 10:39.120]  It's like, what's the, how advanced is their technology?
[10:39.120 --> 10:44.800]  They, they use 40 foot movie screens for their Zoom, Zoom calls.
[10:44.800 --> 10:48.240]  They were too busy to come in for this particular trial.
[10:48.240 --> 10:48.560]  Right.
[10:48.560 --> 10:52.480]  And then they're sentenced to the Phantom zone.
[10:52.480 --> 10:57.760]  And I forget how the Phantom zone has worked in the comics over the time, but I always,
[10:57.760 --> 11:01.920]  I think in the comics, it's sort of another dimension where you go something like that,
[11:01.920 --> 11:05.600]  a timeless dimension where you're stuck for all eternity.
[11:05.600 --> 11:10.560]  Yeah, which seems, seems like maybe not a great idea either because obviously it doesn't,
[11:11.120 --> 11:12.320]  it doesn't work out so good.
[11:12.320 --> 11:12.640]  No.
[11:12.640 --> 11:19.440]  And, but it also, even if it did work out as it was supposed to, it does seem cruel and unusual.
[11:19.440 --> 11:19.920]  Yeah.
[11:19.920 --> 11:20.160]  Yeah.
[11:20.160 --> 11:20.800]  That too.
[11:20.800 --> 11:21.120]  Right.
[11:21.120 --> 11:23.840]  You know, yeah.
[11:23.840 --> 11:28.640]  It's sort of less incarceration with no escape and nothing to do.
[11:28.640 --> 11:28.880]  Yeah.
[11:28.880 --> 11:29.120]  Yeah.
[11:29.120 --> 11:29.680]  No, no.
[11:29.680 --> 11:29.920]  Great.
[11:29.920 --> 11:30.160]  Right.
[11:30.160 --> 11:31.360]  No room for improvement.
[11:31.360 --> 11:33.200]  No, no time.
[11:33.200 --> 11:33.680]  It does.
[11:33.680 --> 11:40.480]  It sounds like many people's description in religion of health and it doesn't, it doesn't
[11:40.480 --> 11:45.600]  anyway, it doesn't seem like civil liberties are that great on planet Krypton, but anyway,
[11:45.600 --> 11:46.800]  but this is how crazy it is.
[11:47.440 --> 11:49.280]  He's he, he votes guilty.
[11:49.840 --> 11:57.360]  Then the, in the movie, the Phantom zone is represented by a large glass square that sort
[11:57.360 --> 11:58.800]  of twists through the world.
[11:58.800 --> 12:00.960]  And then they make them into an album cover.
[12:00.960 --> 12:02.320]  Yeah, they, yeah, exactly.
[12:02.320 --> 12:09.920]  They may come into a giant space-sized album cover and then it goes into space.
[12:09.920 --> 12:17.840]  And of all the places in all the galaxies where they might send the Phantom zone prison
[12:17.840 --> 12:23.920]  with three super criminals is they send that one to earth too.
[12:26.000 --> 12:30.320]  I think there was just some sort of direct highway that went to earth because, because
[12:30.320 --> 12:34.800]  they also send like they send super girl and I think there's, there's a bunch of other,
[12:34.800 --> 12:38.800]  oh, and then, then, then I don't know how that, how at Monel, like, so there's another
[12:38.800 --> 12:43.760]  planet that's orbiting the same sun that Monel comes from.
[12:43.760 --> 12:49.600]  And then the, then there's the dog, which I assume is actually a Kryptonian dog, which
[12:49.600 --> 12:53.120]  just looks like a regular, also looks like a regular earth dog.
[12:54.320 --> 12:54.800]  I don't know.
[12:55.680 --> 12:56.180]  Yeah.
[12:56.180 --> 13:02.660]  So yeah, 80 years of comic books, you can't like, you need to just throw up your hands
[13:02.660 --> 13:05.460]  and try and explain too much of it.
[13:05.460 --> 13:08.660]  But where, and again, it sounds like I'm throwing this movie under the bus.
[13:08.660 --> 13:12.900]  It is still, I think, honestly, I will, I will defend this movie because I think it,
[13:12.900 --> 13:14.340]  I think character wise it is.
[13:14.340 --> 13:14.500]  Yeah.
[13:14.500 --> 13:16.420]  There's a lot of silliness from it in it.
[13:16.420 --> 13:22.100]  And it's, like I said, it's very dated, but I think his, and his portrayal is particularly
[13:22.100 --> 13:22.600]  good.
[13:23.700 --> 13:25.140]  I think Lois is too.
[13:25.140 --> 13:33.380]  I think, I think Lois is, is a very, she, and it reminds me and it, I, I don't know.
[13:33.380 --> 13:38.580]  Again, backstory, maybe they were up for the same roles, but Margo Kidder plays Lois Lane
[13:38.580 --> 13:45.780]  and the character reminds me a lot of Marion in Raiders of the Lost Ark, who was forgetting
[13:45.780 --> 13:46.660]  her name.
[13:46.660 --> 13:48.020]  Yeah, I'm forgetting it too.
[13:48.020 --> 13:54.180]  But similar sort of, Oh, Karen Allen played Marion in Raiders of the Lost Ark.
[13:54.180 --> 13:57.460]  And it is sort of in it.
[13:57.460 --> 14:03.300]  There are obviously some things that weren't, don't stand up to modern times now, but
[14:03.300 --> 14:07.380]  more or less, both of them were a progressive, very progressive.
[14:07.380 --> 14:08.100]  For the time.
[14:08.100 --> 14:08.660]  Yeah.
[14:08.660 --> 14:09.060]  At this.
[14:09.060 --> 14:09.700]  Because they're tough.
[14:09.700 --> 14:10.420]  They're tough as nails.
[14:10.420 --> 14:14.020]  I mean, they're, they're, they're less, I mean, they're more, I'm sorry, they're
[14:14.020 --> 14:19.300]  more ditzy than like Princess Leia, but they're, but they're, but they're all still sort
[14:19.300 --> 14:20.740]  of cut from the same cloth.
[14:20.740 --> 14:21.060]  Right.
[14:21.060 --> 14:25.460]  And they're, they don't need help or they maybe eventually they do, but they don't
[14:25.460 --> 14:26.180]  think they need help.
[14:26.180 --> 14:28.660]  And they're not just, they're not helpless.
[14:28.660 --> 14:29.220]  Right.
[14:29.220 --> 14:34.980]  And, and I think that's very different than it's superhero movies or any kind of action
[14:34.980 --> 14:35.700]  movie.
[14:35.700 --> 14:40.660]  What's the role of the woman going back through decades until you find rare exceptions,
[14:40.660 --> 14:44.340]  like what movies that aren't really action movies, you know, like if you go to the
[14:44.340 --> 14:49.940]  Humphrey Bogart classic era movies, they weren't really written like serial adventures,
[14:49.940 --> 14:54.260]  right? In, in the serial adventures that they based like Raiders and Superman on, but
[14:54.260 --> 14:58.500]  the women were just, their only job was to be tied up and it's, yeah.
[14:58.500 --> 15:00.980]  Are they tied up to a train track or tied up to a tree?
[15:02.020 --> 15:03.380]  Which one did we do last week?
[15:03.380 --> 15:04.580]  We'll do the other one this week.
[15:04.580 --> 15:05.080]  Yeah.
[15:05.940 --> 15:09.140]  There's a very famous gag that I really enjoyed.
[15:09.140 --> 15:13.780]  And again, because it is sort of a timestamp of what was New York.
[15:13.780 --> 15:14.020]  Yeah.
[15:14.020 --> 15:17.860]  I know it's Metropolis, but they are, they, they will go all in with, all right, in our
[15:17.860 --> 15:19.300]  world, Metropolis is New York.
[15:19.300 --> 15:21.060]  It's it's clearly Manhattan.
[15:21.060 --> 15:27.380]  There's a famous gag where the first time he needs to be quick change from Clark to
[15:27.380 --> 15:32.020]  Superman, because Lois of all people, what are the odds is trapped in a helicopter.
[15:32.020 --> 15:33.780]  That's about to crash off the top of the building.
[15:34.500 --> 15:41.380]  And he, he approaches a payphone on the sidewalk and it's not a phone booth, right?
[15:41.380 --> 15:47.300]  The gimmick, the gimmick is Clark would always dash into a phone booth, which adds clear
[15:47.300 --> 15:52.500]  walls, but do a, a worldly bird quick change and pop out as Superman.
[15:52.500 --> 15:55.620]  And that was, that was a trope from the comics that everybody knew.
[15:55.620 --> 16:01.460]  But here, the gag is in New York in 1979, the phones weren't booths anymore.
[16:01.460 --> 16:04.820]  They were just sort of standalone phones on a panel.
[16:04.820 --> 16:07.940]  And yeah, Clark gives it a look like, Hmm, what am I going to do?
[16:07.940 --> 16:08.820]  Can't change in here.
[16:08.820 --> 16:09.460]  Right.
[16:09.460 --> 16:14.340]  And it is very funny to 2023 eyes because it was actually a big, there was a big to
[16:14.340 --> 16:14.820]  do.
[16:14.820 --> 16:21.540]  I now I'm thinking I was going to say everything to me was last year, but it might have been
[16:21.540 --> 16:25.940]  five years ago at this point, like those pandemic years really are a blur.
[16:25.940 --> 16:30.980]  But I remember there was a big to do when Manhattan took out its last payphone period,
[16:30.980 --> 16:31.300]  right?
[16:31.300 --> 16:36.820]  It was like, Hey, there was, there was still a payphone at 57th and sixth or something
[16:36.820 --> 16:37.620]  like that.
[16:37.620 --> 16:39.140]  And here we are taking it out.
[16:39.140 --> 16:40.820]  There's no payphones at all anymore.
[16:40.820 --> 16:41.540]  It was kind of,
[16:41.540 --> 16:45.380]  yeah, we were actually, we went to Victoria BC a week before last.
[16:45.380 --> 16:48.500]  And in the, in the, in the Chinatown, there was, there's a couple of payphones.
[16:48.500 --> 16:49.540]  I took a picture of working.
[16:49.540 --> 16:53.300]  So it was so flabbergasted, but I didn't actually see, I didn't actually lift it up to see if
[16:53.300 --> 16:54.580]  it worked, but I think it, it did.
[16:54.580 --> 16:58.820]  It looked like it was in decent shape actually surprisingly, but that it's, yeah, that's
[16:58.820 --> 17:01.220]  the first one that I've seen in years and years and years.
[17:01.220 --> 17:01.460]  Yeah.
[17:01.460 --> 17:06.420]  Somewhere I can, you know what, actually the, the search will probably work if I search
[17:06.420 --> 17:09.300]  my photo library for payphone or phone booth.
[17:09.300 --> 17:12.180]  Yeah, phone booth, but payphone at least maybe.
[17:12.180 --> 17:14.980]  But I I've seen them around still.
[17:14.980 --> 17:18.660]  And a lot of times they look, they look in bad shape.
[17:18.660 --> 17:22.420]  But they're usually covered in graffiti and oftentimes just beat to crap.
[17:22.420 --> 17:22.580]  Yeah.
[17:22.580 --> 17:25.460]  It doesn't look like something you'd want to put up against your ear.
[17:25.460 --> 17:30.740]  But, and again, in hindsight, it seems odd that that's, that was the, that's just what
[17:30.740 --> 17:33.940]  you did because you needed a payphone for decades.
[17:33.940 --> 17:34.420]  Yeah.
[17:34.420 --> 17:36.980]  But that is an interesting slice of time.
[17:36.980 --> 17:37.300]  Right.
[17:37.300 --> 17:42.020]  Because that period in which payphones were replaced by those stands.
[17:42.020 --> 17:45.540]  I mean, I suppose that must've lasted 30 years, right?
[17:45.540 --> 17:46.100]  Yeah.
[17:46.100 --> 17:51.860]  But it happened in the mid, mid to late seventies and then existed until cell phones took over.
[17:51.860 --> 17:52.100]  Yeah.
[17:52.900 --> 17:55.380]  And I, I don't know what the thinking was in hindsight.
[17:55.380 --> 17:57.620]  I'm like, why did they get rid of phone booths?
[17:57.620 --> 18:03.140]  I guess the idea was when they first made public phones, the idea was everybody wanted
[18:03.140 --> 18:05.300]  privacy for their, it's all about the privacy.
[18:05.300 --> 18:07.940]  We don't, you don't want to be whatever you're saying on the phone.
[18:07.940 --> 18:10.420]  You don't want passers by to overhear.
[18:10.420 --> 18:13.220]  So we'll give you a little independent booth.
[18:13.220 --> 18:18.660]  And I guess that's clearly more expensive than just putting a phone on a stick.
[18:18.660 --> 18:24.580]  And I, I really do think it was probably a hygiene problem.
[18:24.580 --> 18:29.140]  You know, it was also, I bet, I mean, I bet people were living in them.
[18:29.140 --> 18:29.460]  Yeah.
[18:29.460 --> 18:33.300]  People were probably camping out in them and then you can't use the phone because there's
[18:33.300 --> 18:36.740]  some poor soul in there who's set it up as their house.
[18:37.380 --> 18:38.660]  Although they were, it's pretty hard.
[18:38.660 --> 18:41.540]  They were, as I recall, they were pretty, they were pretty tight.
[18:41.540 --> 18:42.180]  Yeah, I know.
[18:42.180 --> 18:46.740]  But if you, but if it's freezing cold and raining out, I mean, you probably would take
[18:46.740 --> 18:47.620]  what you can get.
[18:47.620 --> 18:47.860]  Yeah.
[18:47.860 --> 18:50.500]  You could fold your knees up somehow and sit on the floor.
[18:50.500 --> 18:50.740]  Yeah.
[18:50.740 --> 18:51.620]  At least for a while.
[18:51.620 --> 18:53.540]  I mean, you wouldn't stay in there forever, but.
[18:53.540 --> 18:54.180]  Yeah.
[18:54.180 --> 18:55.780]  But well, we've really brought this down.
[18:57.460 --> 19:01.620]  Speaking of bringing technology, speaking of bringing people down, let me tell you about
[19:01.620 --> 19:02.420]  our first sponsor.
[19:02.420 --> 19:06.980]  It's our good friends at, at Collide.
[19:06.980 --> 19:11.540]  If you're an Okta user, OKTA, well, you're not going to be brought down.
[19:11.540 --> 19:15.220]  You're going to be brought up because Collide has some big news for you.
[19:15.220 --> 19:19.380]  They can get your entire fleet of devices to 100% compliance.
[19:19.380 --> 19:19.620]  How?
[19:20.340 --> 19:25.780]  If a device from your company isn't compliant, then the user will not be able to log into
[19:25.780 --> 19:30.660]  your cloud apps for your organization until they have fixed the problem.
[19:30.660 --> 19:31.780]  It's that simple.
[19:31.780 --> 19:38.020]  Collide patches one of the major holes in zero trust architecture, device compliance.
[19:38.020 --> 19:42.980]  Without Collide, IT departments struggle to solve basic problems like keeping everyone's
[19:42.980 --> 19:45.860]  operating system and browsers up to date.
[19:46.420 --> 19:51.220]  The unsecured devices are logging into your company's apps because there's nothing there
[19:51.220 --> 19:51.860]  to stop them.
[19:51.860 --> 19:56.740]  Collide is the only device trust solution that enforces compliance as part of authentication,
[19:57.460 --> 20:01.060]  and it's built to work seamlessly with Okta.
[20:01.060 --> 20:04.500]  The moment Collide's agent detects a problem, it alerts the user, gives them instructions
[20:04.500 --> 20:08.900]  how to fix it, and if they don't fix the problem within a set amount of time, then they're
[20:08.900 --> 20:09.380]  blocked.
[20:09.380 --> 20:09.780]  That's it.
[20:10.420 --> 20:16.180]  Collide's method means fewer support tickets, less frustration, and most importantly, 100%
[20:16.740 --> 20:19.540]  fleet compliance that you can prove.
[20:19.540 --> 20:24.420]  Visit collide.com slash the talk show to learn more or book a demo.
[20:24.420 --> 20:33.540]  That's K-O-L-I-D-E dot com slash the talk show, collide.com slash the talk show.
[20:34.660 --> 20:40.580]  I wrote a post a little over a week ago making a stink about an ad I saw in the settings
[20:40.580 --> 20:45.780]  app on my phone, and the gist of it is for a couple of weeks, I'd been seeing, and I
[20:45.780 --> 20:49.860]  think it was only on my phone, and again, I'm the professional.
[20:49.860 --> 20:51.060]  I probably should have double checked this.
[20:51.060 --> 20:56.820]  I don't know if it was on my iPad, but on my phone, at the very top of the first level
[20:56.820 --> 21:03.460]  of settings, right underneath your Apple ID, I was getting a promotion to try that I qualified
[21:03.460 --> 21:10.020]  for Apple Arcade for a three-month trial, and it didn't make any sense to me because
[21:10.020 --> 21:15.700]  I've been paying for the Apple One family subscription for, I don't know, $30 or maybe
[21:15.700 --> 21:19.140]  more because we have the extra storage, but it's a good deal for us.
[21:19.140 --> 21:21.860]  We watch Apple TV, we listen to Apple music.
[21:22.580 --> 21:23.460]  What else do we get?
[21:23.460 --> 21:27.700]  We don't use the fitness thing, and I think we play the games a little.
[21:27.700 --> 21:28.020]  I don't know.
[21:28.020 --> 21:29.940]  I'm not really a big gamer, but we've got it.
[21:29.940 --> 21:31.140]  So why were they promoting?
[21:31.140 --> 21:36.660]  If I'm already paying for the bundle with everything, which presumably was what Apple
[21:36.660 --> 21:42.740]  wants people to do, like I'm being a good Apple ecosystem customer from their perspective
[21:42.740 --> 21:47.620]  by paying the most expensive subscription they offer, why are they badgering me here
[21:47.620 --> 21:51.460]  in the settings app to get a free trial for the game?
[21:51.460 --> 21:52.100]  Shouldn't they know?
[21:52.980 --> 21:55.460]  So I need to follow up on that on Daring Fireball.
[21:55.460 --> 21:56.340]  It won't take long.
[21:56.340 --> 21:58.580]  Won't even take nearly as long as my explanation there.
[21:59.460 --> 22:01.140]  Did you get any result from that?
[22:01.140 --> 22:02.660]  Is it still there or is it gone now?
[22:03.300 --> 22:06.740]  Well, what I did was I told myself, this is how my brain works.
[22:06.740 --> 22:09.460]  It's how I beat my procrastination.
[22:10.020 --> 22:12.980]  I told myself, I should write about this on Daring Fireball.
[22:12.980 --> 22:15.460]  This is a good grist for the blog.
[22:15.460 --> 22:18.900]  I won't tap through and say not now, right?
[22:18.900 --> 22:21.940]  Because if you tap that thing, you get two options on the next page.
[22:21.940 --> 22:26.340]  It's like subscribe to start my free trial or not now.
[22:26.340 --> 22:29.940]  And I figured tapping not now would make it go away and stop annoying me.
[22:29.940 --> 22:34.180]  But I told myself, I'm not allowed to do that until I post.
[22:34.180 --> 22:38.420]  So I wrote the article and then I thought, OK, let's see if this gets rid of it.
[22:38.420 --> 22:40.100]  And then I tap not now.
[22:40.100 --> 22:42.260]  And then it did go away and I stayed away.
[22:42.260 --> 22:43.060]  It's possible.
[22:43.060 --> 22:46.260]  Maybe that was a mistake because maybe someone at Apple would have wanted to look at.
[22:46.260 --> 22:52.820]  But anyway, unsurprisingly, I posted some people at Apple noticed and it looked into
[22:52.820 --> 23:01.380]  it with the speaking of superpowers, my weird superpower, where if I blog about a bug, yeah,
[23:01.380 --> 23:03.300]  I, I can get results.
[23:03.300 --> 23:05.860]  I could get results like the rest of us.
[23:05.860 --> 23:11.700]  And so and like like our friend, Kalel, I try to use my superpower wisely.
[23:11.700 --> 23:14.180]  My superpower wisely and for good.
[23:14.180 --> 23:15.620]  And I don't want to waste anybody's time.
[23:16.260 --> 23:18.180]  I will point out you're wearing a blue shirt today, too.
[23:18.180 --> 23:26.420]  So, yeah, the gist of it, though, is it boils down to the fact that I'm one of the legacy
[23:26.420 --> 23:28.100]  accounts with.
[23:29.700 --> 23:36.660]  A separate Apple ID for iCloud from my iTunes purchases ID.
[23:36.660 --> 23:40.020]  So what happened?
[23:40.020 --> 23:46.180]  What happened was way back when I was I signed up for iTunes before Mac.com was even a thing,
[23:46.180 --> 23:46.740]  right?
[23:46.740 --> 23:49.860]  What we now call iCloud has had several names.
[23:49.860 --> 23:51.140]  Mac.com.
[23:51.140 --> 23:53.860]  Then it was me.com.
[23:53.860 --> 23:54.180]  Yeah.
[23:54.180 --> 23:55.300]  Mobile me.
[23:55.300 --> 23:55.700]  Yeah.
[23:55.700 --> 23:57.940]  But with the domain me.com.
[23:57.940 --> 24:03.540]  And then they were like, let's rebrand to iCloud right at the tail end of Steve Jobs's
[24:03.540 --> 24:12.340]  life and and then iCloud.com, you can tell which era somebody's ideas from because you
[24:12.340 --> 24:16.020]  can like if for me who signed up, do you have a Mac.com?
[24:16.020 --> 24:18.260]  I've got I've got a Mac.com address.
[24:18.260 --> 24:24.980]  And yeah, but then you get for free the same name at me.com and then I same name at iCloud.com.
[24:24.980 --> 24:31.060]  But if you only sign up now, you only get iCloud.com and you can't get Clark Kent at
[24:31.060 --> 24:33.060]  Mac.com to work.
[24:33.780 --> 24:38.580]  But anyway, I had an iTunes account from 2001 when I first started selling things, and I
[24:38.580 --> 24:42.980]  signed up for that with my at during Fireball email address.
[24:42.980 --> 24:49.380]  And then Mac.com comes out and I signed up and got my user ID.
[24:50.420 --> 25:00.180]  And I don't know, I guess it's just sort of the way that Apple wasn't good at services
[25:00.180 --> 25:04.020]  back then that they were separate, totally separate things.
[25:04.020 --> 25:06.180]  And they've always been separate things.
[25:06.180 --> 25:11.860]  And I guess the chance at some point, what I could have done was just go all in with
[25:11.860 --> 25:16.980]  my Mac.com ID like most people do and use that ID for store purchases.
[25:16.980 --> 25:19.300]  And then what I would have done, though, is lost the music.
[25:21.140 --> 25:24.900]  I'd have the music, but it wouldn't be in my history anymore.
[25:24.900 --> 25:25.220]  Right.
[25:25.220 --> 25:27.780]  And whatever shows or movies I bought.
[25:27.780 --> 25:30.100]  So I've just stuck with it for all these years.
[25:30.100 --> 25:37.060]  I've got just a different log email and password for purchases than I do for iCloud.
[25:37.860 --> 25:39.940]  But it's all intersected now.
[25:39.940 --> 25:40.820]  It's all weird.
[25:40.820 --> 25:47.940]  I think the diagram on the whiteboard of how this works is like the classic meme of Charlie
[25:47.940 --> 25:54.660]  from It's Always Sunny with the crazy conspiracy theory, because I make purchases with this
[25:54.660 --> 26:01.620]  other ID, but my iCloud is where I make the purchase for Apple One, which is the subscription
[26:01.620 --> 26:06.500]  that gives us the access to Apple TV Plus and the music.
[26:06.500 --> 26:08.980]  So it really does blur together at that point.
[26:08.980 --> 26:18.900]  And something, the bug is I qualified for three months of Apple Arcade on my purchase
[26:18.900 --> 26:20.340]  ID account for something.
[26:20.340 --> 26:21.460]  It doesn't matter what.
[26:21.460 --> 26:21.940]  I don't know.
[26:21.940 --> 26:28.900]  I bought something and somehow the purchase I bought was with that ID at the Apple store
[26:28.900 --> 26:32.020]  and it qualified me for three months.
[26:32.020 --> 26:37.860]  But because my iCloud ID is this other ID, whatever the code is to say, does this person
[26:37.860 --> 26:39.620]  even need this free offer?
[26:39.620 --> 26:40.500]  It didn't work.
[26:40.500 --> 26:45.620]  And people are looking into it and this will be fixed supposedly in a future update.
[26:45.620 --> 26:46.740]  And it's not.
[26:46.740 --> 26:50.980]  There's a sort of subtle, this isn't really Apple's fault.
[26:50.980 --> 26:55.140]  And this isn't a problem that most people are facing sort of.
[26:55.140 --> 26:56.820]  I mean, yeah, it's probably not.
[26:56.820 --> 26:59.860]  It's probably not something that a lot of people are facing, but it's still Apple's
[26:59.860 --> 27:00.100]  fault.
[27:00.740 --> 27:09.380]  And I feel like there is, as they layer on more and more services, they run into more
[27:09.380 --> 27:13.540]  and more of these problems because we had a problem recently, because I think I just
[27:13.540 --> 27:18.020]  got Karen onto my, and I'm not sure if it's related to this, but it seems like it might
[27:18.020 --> 27:22.420]  be onto the Apple card she had not been on to date.
[27:22.420 --> 27:24.980]  And so she finally joined the Apple card thing.
[27:24.980 --> 27:31.220]  And now for some reason, app purchases are not being shared correctly.
[27:31.940 --> 27:33.380]  Like she has it turned on.
[27:33.380 --> 27:36.180]  She has turned on shared app purchases with me and Hank.
[27:36.180 --> 27:40.100]  And yet every time she buys an app and Hank, cause we did this because we play game nights
[27:40.100 --> 27:43.860]  online sometimes with friends and we were like, let's play this this week.
[27:43.860 --> 27:47.620]  And so she buys the app and then I go to buy it thinking I'm not going to be charged when
[27:47.620 --> 27:49.220]  it comes time to click the button.
[27:49.220 --> 27:51.620]  I click the button, I get charged again.
[27:51.620 --> 27:56.020]  And it's like, and I went downstairs and they're like, we're going to get another game.
[27:56.020 --> 27:57.700]  Like, let me check your device first.
[27:57.700 --> 28:02.740]  And so let's here's like, okay, it looks like it's set correctly and did it again and still
[28:02.740 --> 28:04.580]  got charged charged twice.
[28:04.580 --> 28:09.220]  So I don't know if it was related to the Apple card thing or not, but for some reason it's
[28:09.220 --> 28:11.140]  not working right anymore.
[28:11.140 --> 28:16.100]  And it just seems like it's one of those situations where, and it used to where like something
[28:16.100 --> 28:19.060]  got added and that screwed up the entire process.
[28:19.060 --> 28:24.500]  But are you saying then, so you've got the family account with the three of you.
[28:24.500 --> 28:27.940]  Are you saying though, that if you make a purchase, it does.
[28:27.940 --> 28:29.140]  We haven't tried that yet.
[28:29.140 --> 28:31.460]  I bet if I make a purchase, it will work correctly.
[28:31.460 --> 28:31.960]  Right.
[28:33.700 --> 28:35.780]  As the point person, I don't forget.
[28:35.780 --> 28:41.140]  Yeah, as like the parent account or, well, I mean, she's literally a parent account as
[28:41.140 --> 28:43.700]  well, but I'm the one who set it all up.
[28:43.700 --> 28:44.200]  Right.
[28:44.200 --> 28:50.120]  It got me thinking in my post and it was sort of a way to, it's been something that's been
[28:50.120 --> 29:03.160]  on my mind anyway, is just the basic complaint of is Apple giving us too many ads in abusing
[29:03.160 --> 29:10.760]  their position as the system provider to show us ads that we shouldn't be seeing.
[29:10.760 --> 29:18.280]  And so, okay, this one thing I saw in the settings app was a bug with an explanation.
[29:18.920 --> 29:26.920]  But there are a lot of other places where Apple sends, I laugh, I'm laughing here on
[29:26.920 --> 29:28.600]  the podcast, but I get the dilemma.
[29:28.600 --> 29:31.240]  Is it, what is an ad comes up, right?
[29:31.240 --> 29:36.760]  Like on this podcast, the ads are very obvious, right?
[29:36.760 --> 29:41.320]  We're talking like we just were, and then I take a break and I say, I would like to
[29:41.320 --> 29:42.600]  thank a sponsor.
[29:42.600 --> 29:48.200]  And then I name the sponsor and I have some talking points to tell you, the listener,
[29:48.200 --> 29:48.520]  about.
[29:48.520 --> 29:54.920]  And then at the end, there's always some kind of action item, which is usually a URL to
[29:54.920 --> 29:59.960]  go to their slash the talk show or whatever the URL is.
[29:59.960 --> 30:02.360]  And then we go back to talking about content.
[30:02.360 --> 30:07.720]  And if you're the listener, that was an ad, and that's how the show is monetized.
[30:07.720 --> 30:08.220]  Right.
[30:09.000 --> 30:11.880]  That's for people who are not paying for this.
[30:13.880 --> 30:17.080]  No one has put down money for this podcast.
[30:17.080 --> 30:17.320]  Right.
[30:17.320 --> 30:22.120]  That's the deal is you get to listen to the podcast and I read ads and you get to do it.
[30:22.120 --> 30:23.080]  That's how it's paid.
[30:23.080 --> 30:31.320]  You buy an iPhone and you give Apple $1,000 and you start paying your Verizon or AT&T
[30:31.320 --> 30:36.680]  or T-Mobile or whoever your carrier is 50 plus dollars a month for service.
[30:37.240 --> 30:38.760]  You're spending a lot of money.
[30:38.760 --> 30:46.920]  And then you start and I think and people have told me this people who are more sensitive
[30:46.920 --> 30:47.640]  to these ads.
[30:47.640 --> 30:55.160]  There's it's an interesting personality trait because people have very it's not like binary.
[30:55.160 --> 30:56.520]  You're either annoyed or not.
[30:56.520 --> 30:59.320]  People just have a different range of what they find annoying.
[30:59.320 --> 31:04.680]  But there are some people who find all of these things very, very annoying and would
[31:04.680 --> 31:06.040]  prefer to never get them.
[31:06.040 --> 31:12.200]  But you start getting offers for things from Apple like as they're not text messages.
[31:12.200 --> 31:18.600]  They're just notifications that come in and they say things like because you bought an
[31:18.600 --> 31:22.760]  iPhone, you qualify for I don't even know what you get.
[31:22.760 --> 31:29.160]  Remember for a while you'd get a full year of Apple TV plus service and there's promotions
[31:29.160 --> 31:33.640]  maybe you get Apple music because you bought during this back to school period or something
[31:33.640 --> 31:34.040]  like that.
[31:35.080 --> 31:36.040]  Is that an ad?
[31:37.080 --> 31:37.640]  I guess.
[31:38.520 --> 31:41.880]  Yeah, but it's like I'd say it's an ad for sure.
[31:41.880 --> 31:42.280]  Right.
[31:42.280 --> 31:46.680]  And the thing the one that drives me crazy in particular is every time I get an iPad,
[31:46.680 --> 31:53.400]  they want me to set up Apple pay on my iPad, which I mean, I will use my Apple card.
[31:53.400 --> 31:57.560]  Yes, but I don't also need to use like my bank cards.
[31:57.560 --> 32:01.720]  And I mean, on my iPad, I rarely ever do any of that stuff.
[32:01.720 --> 32:04.200]  I do on my phone all the time, but not on my iPad.
[32:04.200 --> 32:11.480]  And I have that red mark on it to go through a process every time I get an iPad to get
[32:11.480 --> 32:12.280]  rid of that red mark.
[32:12.280 --> 32:15.480]  And it's why it's not the way I use this device.
[32:15.480 --> 32:16.120]  You know what?
[32:16.120 --> 32:22.280]  And I think you've put your finger on an aspect that judging from emails and tweets and stuff
[32:22.280 --> 32:28.040]  like that that I get sent, people have a low tolerance for those red dots.
[32:28.680 --> 32:30.040]  Yeah, they really do.
[32:30.040 --> 32:32.040]  People write giant articles about it.
[32:32.040 --> 32:32.680]  Right.
[32:32.680 --> 32:34.520]  And there's a lot of people.
[32:34.520 --> 32:39.800]  I obviously don't famously have thousands and thousands of unread emails, and I keep
[32:39.800 --> 32:40.600]  for whatever.
[32:40.600 --> 32:45.320]  This is the part that I guess is weird that I don't have them on my Mac, but on my iOS
[32:45.320 --> 32:49.000]  devices, I've never turned off the badge for mail.
[32:49.000 --> 32:53.880]  So if I send a screenshot of my home screen, some people go into conniption.
[32:53.880 --> 32:56.600]  It's a visceral reaction.
[32:56.600 --> 32:57.640]  But I get it.
[32:57.640 --> 32:58.040]  I do.
[32:59.400 --> 33:05.400]  I totally understand the urge to not have any red badges on any icons, and it's probably
[33:05.400 --> 33:08.280]  a much healthier way to deal with it.
[33:08.280 --> 33:12.440]  Like, I think the people out there, those of you listening, I'm sure there's thousands
[33:12.440 --> 33:17.640]  of you who, if there's a red badge on your home screen, you take care of it.
[33:17.640 --> 33:19.880]  If it's a message, you read it.
[33:19.880 --> 33:25.000]  If it's some other app that gives you red dots, you go into the app and figure out what
[33:25.000 --> 33:28.040]  the dot is about and make it go away.
[33:28.040 --> 33:28.600]  Deal with it.
[33:29.160 --> 33:33.880]  And then when your phone has no red badges, you've dealt with everything you need to deal
[33:33.880 --> 33:34.280]  with.
[33:34.280 --> 33:35.640]  Yeah, I think people.
[33:35.640 --> 33:41.080]  So therefore, with that mentality, when you've got a red dot that says set up Apple Pay on
[33:41.080 --> 33:46.120]  this device and you don't want to set up Apple Pay, what do you do?
[33:46.120 --> 33:46.620]  Yeah.
[33:46.620 --> 33:52.060]  Well, yeah, you go through the you start the process and then you stop it, which which
[33:52.060 --> 33:53.900]  is dumb, right?
[33:54.460 --> 33:56.540]  You know, there should just be at the top level.
[33:56.540 --> 33:58.140]  There should be just a dismiss this.
[33:59.580 --> 34:04.860]  Yeah, there's and as a writer, I get it.
[34:04.860 --> 34:06.300]  And I'm sure you do, too.
[34:06.300 --> 34:16.380]  Like you can easily imagine the meetings at Apple that led to every word, every button
[34:16.380 --> 34:16.700]  name.
[34:17.900 --> 34:21.900]  It is all extremely thoughtful.
[34:23.020 --> 34:27.100]  I think surprising people would be shocked at how much time Apple spends.
[34:27.100 --> 34:36.140]  Tweaking that verbiage to get it just so, but the just so is sort of a very fine line
[34:37.020 --> 34:42.380]  of assuming that ultimately you definitely want to set up Apple Pay, right?
[34:42.940 --> 34:47.820]  Like, you may not want to do it right now, but even if you don't do it right now, you're
[34:47.820 --> 34:49.180]  going to want to do it later.
[34:50.140 --> 34:55.740]  But without coming out and telling you where Apple, the giant corporation who you just
[34:55.740 --> 34:59.980]  paid $1000 for the phone, and we're going to boss you around and annoy you with a red
[34:59.980 --> 35:05.980]  dot because we also want you to use our financial product, they are not going to say it that
[35:05.980 --> 35:06.540]  way.
[35:06.540 --> 35:11.980]  And they can and it's like they've got plausible deniability with everything that they say.
[35:11.980 --> 35:18.540]  I know in particular, I know that many people are very annoyed by their not now buttons,
[35:18.540 --> 35:19.100]  right?
[35:19.100 --> 35:21.980]  Because some people, they know the answer is never.
[35:21.980 --> 35:27.740]  This device is going to my child who's a first grader or something.
[35:27.740 --> 35:29.980]  I'm going to set up this iPad for my first grader.
[35:29.980 --> 35:32.940]  I am definitely not putting Apple Pay on this, right?
[35:34.300 --> 35:37.820]  My first grade, my daughter in first grade does not have a credit card.
[35:39.500 --> 35:41.500]  So why must I do this?
[35:41.500 --> 35:43.660]  And not now bothers them.
[35:43.660 --> 35:49.740]  I see now not now doesn't bother me, not now I salute the cleverness of Apple Pay.
[35:49.740 --> 35:56.300]  I salute the cleverness of it because it does mean it has a very precise meaning, but it
[35:56.300 --> 36:00.060]  also gives you the information.
[36:00.620 --> 36:07.420]  Because if you are, I guess what Apple is thinking is if you are thinking not now, but
[36:07.420 --> 36:14.300]  maybe later, pushing a not now button sort of gives you and you're not an expert iOS
[36:14.300 --> 36:18.220]  user, you're a very typical user, it gives you some degree of confidence that if you
[36:18.220 --> 36:21.980]  do change your mind in the future, you haven't made a permanent decision.
[36:23.580 --> 36:25.740]  But for the people who know that it is.
[36:26.620 --> 36:28.060]  Yeah, I guess I suppose so.
[36:28.060 --> 36:31.260]  But it doesn't seem like it seems obvious that that's the kind of thing that you could
[36:31.260 --> 36:33.020]  set up again later if you wanted to.
[36:33.020 --> 36:37.100]  Like it should be, you would think, but you have to go find it, I guess.
[36:37.100 --> 36:37.660]  Right.
[36:37.660 --> 36:40.380]  For some people is a harder task than that.
[36:40.380 --> 36:41.100]  All right.
[36:41.100 --> 36:49.340]  And I bigger picture, it's an Apple has, I think, these ads are weird because they're
[36:49.340 --> 36:51.260]  all for Apple's own services, right?
[36:51.260 --> 36:55.180]  So they're, it's not like somebody else is paying for them.
[36:55.180 --> 37:01.180]  It's Apple itself promoting additional ways to get more out of your device, right?
[37:01.180 --> 37:03.420]  Some of them aren't an upsell at all, right?
[37:03.420 --> 37:09.580]  Like the ones from the tips app, which I think is a very clever design to help people who
[37:09.580 --> 37:13.660]  are new to the iPhone, maybe they just switched from Android, you know, according to Apple,
[37:13.660 --> 37:19.500]  there's maybe like a million of them every week or something, some crazy number of people
[37:19.500 --> 37:20.940]  buying their first iPhones.
[37:20.940 --> 37:28.860]  And I know for those of us who've been using them too much for 15, 16 years, it's crazy,
[37:28.860 --> 37:30.460]  but there are people who are new to it.
[37:30.460 --> 37:36.780]  And I think the way that they sort of surface those tips is I think it's fascinating.
[37:36.780 --> 37:43.180]  And I think it's the sort of thing where they're very thoughtful, experienced designers who
[37:43.180 --> 37:44.460]  are responsible for that.
[37:44.460 --> 37:48.140]  And nobody really gives them credit and says, you know, who's really on top of their game
[37:48.140 --> 37:49.900]  at Apple, the tips team.
[37:49.900 --> 37:50.540]  Yeah.
[37:50.540 --> 37:57.020]  And as someone who doesn't jump on the betas the minute after WWDC, I find them helpful
[37:57.020 --> 38:02.380]  too, because I usually don't, I mean, I often get on the public beta, but by that, even
[38:02.380 --> 38:05.740]  by that point, I'm trying to remember exactly what all the new features are.
[38:05.740 --> 38:08.220]  Like a month or a month or so after WWDC.
[38:08.220 --> 38:09.900]  I'm like, okay, what did they announce again?
[38:09.900 --> 38:13.100]  And so I actually, I use the tip thing almost every time.
[38:13.100 --> 38:13.600]  Yeah.
[38:14.300 --> 38:15.580]  And they're not upselling you.
[38:15.580 --> 38:20.300]  It's all the, everything, I think everything in tips is how to, how to use what you've
[38:20.300 --> 38:21.260]  already paid for.
[38:21.260 --> 38:22.460]  But it could be worse.
[38:22.460 --> 38:25.340]  Like they could be, they could be allowing other parties to do these.
[38:25.340 --> 38:36.620]  Somebody at Apple is looking at that, you know, that empty column in the spreadsheet.
[38:36.620 --> 38:41.420]  There are other ones that they send you as a new user though, that if the message hits
[38:41.420 --> 38:45.260]  you and you, the users think, oh, that sounds interesting.
[38:45.260 --> 38:46.540]  I've been thinking about that.
[38:46.540 --> 38:48.060]  I would like to do that.
[38:48.060 --> 38:53.260]  It is all about getting you to start paying Apple a subscription price for Apple Music
[38:53.260 --> 38:56.460]  or the Apple one bundle or something like that.
[38:56.460 --> 38:59.660]  I don't think they should never send such messages.
[38:59.660 --> 39:01.100]  I think it is reasonable.
[39:01.100 --> 39:04.700]  And I think there are people who don't know about these things.
[39:05.660 --> 39:08.220]  And so it's worth messaging them.
[39:08.220 --> 39:15.340]  But I, I wonder though, if they aren't, I mean, one way to look at anything in life
[39:15.340 --> 39:19.900]  is that you can, you have to figure out which side you want to approach perfection from
[39:19.900 --> 39:23.260]  and assume we're all humans, we're going to make mistakes.
[39:23.260 --> 39:29.340]  And so should we err on the side of sending too many promotional messages or should we
[39:29.340 --> 39:31.340]  err on the side of sending too few?
[39:32.300 --> 39:38.540]  And I kind of feel like Apple is very close to the right line, but they're sort of, but
[39:38.540 --> 39:41.900]  they're coming at it from the, well, if we're going to make a mistake, let's send a few
[39:41.900 --> 39:42.700]  too many.
[39:42.700 --> 39:43.820]  Yeah, yeah.
[39:43.820 --> 39:48.380]  I don't feel like, in general, I feel like, yeah, it does feel like it's just slightly
[39:48.380 --> 39:48.860]  too many.
[39:48.860 --> 39:54.060]  And I don't get some of the ones that other people seem to do, seem to get for some reason.
[39:54.060 --> 39:59.420]  Again, it's weird what some people experience and what other people don't, for instance,
[39:59.420 --> 40:03.180]  you know, like you getting your arcade notification.
[40:03.180 --> 40:03.500]  Right.
[40:03.500 --> 40:10.780]  I don't, I mean, I, some people have shown things that are, seem pretty egregious to
[40:10.780 --> 40:13.420]  me, but I have not gotten those things.
[40:13.420 --> 40:20.060]  Usually I'll get, often I'll get a notification that some show is available on Apple TV+.
[40:20.060 --> 40:22.380]  And usually it's like, it's like, okay.
[40:22.380 --> 40:26.380]  I mean, it's either a show that I watch and it's a reminder that there's a new episode,
[40:26.380 --> 40:30.460]  which is the thing that I don't mind that so much because sometimes I will forget.
[40:30.460 --> 40:35.180]  The thing that drives me crazy is if I've already watched it, which has happened several
[40:35.180 --> 40:35.420]  times.
[40:35.420 --> 40:37.420]  It's like, there's a new episode of Ted Lasso.
[40:37.420 --> 40:39.340]  I was like, yeah, I watched it like two hours ago.
[40:39.340 --> 40:40.460]  Why are you telling me about it?
[40:41.020 --> 40:42.940]  You should know that I saw it already.
[40:42.940 --> 40:43.500]  All right.
[40:43.500 --> 40:47.660]  Well, and that sort of gets to a point that I made in my article complaining about this
[40:47.660 --> 40:54.540]  settings bug where we collectively have, certainly I have, have complained strongly about the
[40:54.540 --> 41:01.180]  surveillance based advertising epitomized by Facebook and Google, where they seemingly
[41:01.180 --> 41:02.940]  know too much about you.
[41:02.940 --> 41:11.980]  And my wife, Amy, she keeps, she knows that, I think she knows that her devices aren't
[41:11.980 --> 41:19.420]  listening to her, but she's, she's had some really freaky things and she's like, okay,
[41:19.420 --> 41:19.820]  come on.
[41:19.820 --> 41:21.580]  So here's a recent example.
[41:21.580 --> 41:23.100]  This isn't really about Apple.
[41:23.100 --> 41:32.460]  It's, I think it's more of an Instagram thing, but yeah, she bought a little shelf, little
[41:32.460 --> 41:33.340]  skinny shelf.
[41:34.060 --> 41:36.060]  It looks almost like the type of thing.
[41:36.060 --> 41:40.460]  Remember like, like in elementary school, did you have like, like when the books came
[41:40.460 --> 41:46.220]  back, sometimes the kid you'd be tasked with here, take these books and put them back on
[41:46.220 --> 41:47.660]  the shelf in the right place.
[41:47.660 --> 41:50.460]  And it'd be like a little wheelie cart for books.
[41:50.460 --> 41:54.860]  You know, she got something like that for our laundry room, very skinny.
[41:54.860 --> 41:58.780]  And it, I think it goes between the washer and the dryer, but she just wanted a place
[41:58.780 --> 42:03.500]  to put some more, I don't know, fabric softener and whatever else you keep in a laundry room.
[42:04.140 --> 42:05.100]  And she bought it.
[42:06.220 --> 42:10.300]  She said like during the pandemic, like, so a long, you know, two years ago.
[42:10.300 --> 42:11.820]  And just never set it up.
[42:11.820 --> 42:17.820]  And then like a few weeks ago, she's like, why didn't you set me up?
[42:17.820 --> 42:19.580]  Yeah, I got no, but she did.
[42:19.580 --> 42:24.940]  She, she took it out and it ended up being an extremely easy assembly.
[42:24.940 --> 42:26.460]  She was, I said, I'll do that.
[42:26.460 --> 42:31.180]  You know, I thought I'd earned some good spouse points, but unlike an Ikea thing where you
[42:31.180 --> 42:33.020]  have to put it all together, I think it has three shelves.
[42:33.020 --> 42:35.340]  The whole thing was together except for the wheels on the bottom.
[42:35.340 --> 42:39.020]  I just had to snap wheels on the bottom and it was already together because it's such
[42:39.020 --> 42:40.300]  a skinny little thing.
[42:40.300 --> 42:43.900]  It wasn't difficult to box in an efficient space, efficient way.
[42:43.900 --> 42:45.580]  Anyway, I put it together.
[42:45.580 --> 42:47.020]  Now it's in our laundry room.
[42:47.020 --> 42:54.380]  And like the next day she got an ad on Instagram for that shelf, the exact thing from the same
[42:54.380 --> 42:57.420]  company that she'd bought two years ago.
[42:58.140 --> 43:04.780]  And we had just spent like just a typical husband and wife conversation about a task
[43:04.780 --> 43:05.100]  like that.
[43:05.100 --> 43:05.820]  Like, I'll do it.
[43:05.820 --> 43:09.260]  I'll put this together for you and then you'll have a nice little carton a lot.
[43:09.260 --> 43:12.060]  But she's like, now you tell me that this thing isn't listening to us.
[43:12.060 --> 43:13.740]  And she knows that it's not.
[43:13.740 --> 43:16.860]  And I said, I don't even think we mentioned the name of the company, right?
[43:16.860 --> 43:20.380]  We, we talked about it, but it's, but it is weird.
[43:20.380 --> 43:26.620]  And it's a weird thing all the way around to, so you just think like, how the hell does
[43:26.620 --> 43:31.980]  Instagram know so much about her that they're showing her a little Japanese laundry room
[43:31.980 --> 43:36.060]  shelf that she already bought two years ago and was just thinking about.
[43:36.060 --> 43:37.500]  That's how on point their ads are.
[43:37.500 --> 43:44.380]  And meanwhile, Apple doesn't know that John Moltz just watched Ted Lasso two hours ago.
[43:44.380 --> 43:50.140]  I really look forward to driving my GM car down the road and getting notifications for
[43:50.140 --> 43:55.740]  services from General Motors on the dash of my car to sign up for.
[43:55.740 --> 44:01.980]  Isn't, isn't that, must press okay to proceed driving down the road.
[44:01.980 --> 44:02.480]  Right.
[44:02.780 --> 44:06.220]  I've been thinking so much more about that GM thing.
[44:06.220 --> 44:08.300]  Just it's better.
[44:08.300 --> 44:11.500]  I guess it's better podcast topic than a column topic.
[44:11.500 --> 44:17.820]  Cause it's, it's so speculative, but it's like the more I think about it and GM just
[44:17.820 --> 44:21.260]  had like, I think they did their earnings call or something and it came up.
[44:21.260 --> 44:27.420]  The, the basic story from three or four weeks ago was they're going to drop carplay support
[44:27.420 --> 44:34.620]  from future electronic vehicles, but that the ones, the EVs and the gas cars that already
[44:34.620 --> 44:39.340]  have carplay will keep having carplay, which is weird in and of itself.
[44:39.340 --> 44:43.340]  Like if you think there's a good idea, why, why would you only say new?
[44:43.340 --> 44:48.940]  But that's what they said, but lo and behold, canceled the bold, right?
[44:48.940 --> 44:49.440]  Yeah.
[44:49.440 --> 44:55.760]  So the volt is their award-winning, but probably, I think I haven't driven one, but I do believe
[44:55.760 --> 45:00.240]  it's, it might be the most innovative vehicle GM has made in a long time.
[45:00.240 --> 45:06.960]  Especially if you're, if you're looking at it from a EVs are the future, they make big,
[45:06.960 --> 45:09.840]  lots and lots of big, big trucks and SUVs.
[45:09.840 --> 45:14.560]  And they, it's where they make most of their money and lots and lots of Americans love
[45:14.560 --> 45:16.960]  to buy very big trucks and SUVs.
[45:16.960 --> 45:18.800]  And I don't, I don't know.
[45:18.800 --> 45:20.320]  I don't, I don't like driving them.
[45:20.320 --> 45:26.000]  I don't like running them, but for people with a sort of the volt, is it the volt or
[45:26.000 --> 45:26.400]  the bolt?
[45:26.400 --> 45:27.360]  It was the volt, right?
[45:27.360 --> 45:27.920]  I can't remember.
[45:27.920 --> 45:28.800]  That might be the bolt.
[45:28.800 --> 45:33.360]  Well, I'll try to, I'll try to blur my pronunciation together, but anyway, that's the one that
[45:33.360 --> 45:37.200]  people were like, well, that's the only car from GM I care about.
[45:37.200 --> 45:42.560]  And so at least they'll still keep carplay on that because it's not a new EV, but they've
[45:42.560 --> 45:49.120]  said they're canceling it so that they can use the reuse that production effort with
[45:49.120 --> 45:49.840]  a B.
[45:49.840 --> 45:50.240]  Yes.
[45:50.240 --> 45:50.560]  All right.
[45:50.560 --> 45:53.200]  It's the V volt would have been better though.
[45:53.200 --> 45:53.760]  Cause it's electric.
[45:53.760 --> 45:54.000]  Yeah.
[45:54.000 --> 45:54.320]  Right.
[45:54.320 --> 45:54.880]  Right.
[45:54.880 --> 45:56.240]  Maybe that lightning bolt.
[45:56.240 --> 45:56.640]  Yeah.
[45:56.640 --> 45:56.880]  Yeah.
[45:56.880 --> 45:57.520]  All right.
[45:57.520 --> 45:58.000]  No.
[45:58.000 --> 45:58.320]  All right.
[45:58.320 --> 45:59.360]  I'll give them the lightning bolt.
[45:59.360 --> 46:00.000]  It's a good name.
[46:00.000 --> 46:03.440]  It's even a good name, even though I couldn't remember it, but it's a good name.
[46:03.440 --> 46:04.480]  They're going to stop now.
[46:04.480 --> 46:05.840]  They're going to stop making it.
[46:07.040 --> 46:11.840]  And, and the thing that caught my attention was that in this call where they talked about
[46:11.840 --> 46:16.160]  this and said, the bolt is gone and we're going in a new direction is they keep talking
[46:16.160 --> 46:17.360]  about data collection.
[46:18.160 --> 46:18.800]  Like, yeah.
[46:18.800 --> 46:19.040]  Right.
[46:19.040 --> 46:24.960]  Like the line from speculative, but it's not really that speculative, right?
[46:24.960 --> 46:28.880]  Because they keep dropping the keywords that make it seem like, you know, this is exactly
[46:28.880 --> 46:29.440]  what they're doing.
[46:29.440 --> 46:29.940]  Right.
[46:30.640 --> 46:38.800]  Rivian and Tesla famously Tesla makes the, by far the most electric cars Rivian probably
[46:38.800 --> 46:45.440]  makes the premier critically acclaimed SUVs and pickup trucks in the space.
[46:46.320 --> 46:51.680]  And their explanation of why they go their own way and don't support carplay is that
[46:51.680 --> 46:55.840]  they want, they both sound like Apple when they explain it, they want to make the whole
[46:55.840 --> 46:58.080]  experience and control the whole experience.
[46:58.080 --> 46:59.200]  And they can't do that.
[46:59.200 --> 47:05.040]  If they're, if they're putting up the screen to some third party, no matter how good the
[47:05.040 --> 47:11.440]  third party's thing is that, that they're offering a better user experience by doing
[47:11.440 --> 47:13.040]  what Apple does with its devices.
[47:13.040 --> 47:13.280]  Right.
[47:13.280 --> 47:16.720]  Apple doesn't put Android on their cell phone hardware.
[47:16.720 --> 47:20.320]  They have their own entire OS architecture.
[47:21.360 --> 47:24.640]  That is that, that they're two sides of the same coin.
[47:24.640 --> 47:30.160]  Apple has talks about this almost every year and their big product introductions only Tim
[47:30.160 --> 47:30.400]  Cook.
[47:30.400 --> 47:34.960]  There was a year where the theme was only Apple, only Apple can do blank because of
[47:34.960 --> 47:37.040]  this marriage of software and hardware.
[47:37.040 --> 47:38.480]  And they're trying to do that with their car.
[47:38.480 --> 47:39.360]  Okay, blah, blah, blah.
[47:39.360 --> 47:42.720]  I, and I, people, some people really liked the Tesla interface.
[47:42.720 --> 47:46.480]  I, the Rivian thing that I had the long test drive in, it's good.
[47:47.280 --> 47:49.840]  And it is more than just a rectangle.
[47:49.840 --> 47:54.960]  It's, it's this weird odd screen, but Apple clearly is embracing that.
[47:54.960 --> 47:59.360]  Last year at WWDC, they spent a long time in the keynote at WWDC last year, talking
[47:59.360 --> 48:06.400]  about quote, next generation carplay, which would be able to support like a irregularly
[48:06.400 --> 48:12.640]  shaped screen that spans from the driver across to the passenger, going more in the direction
[48:12.640 --> 48:17.040]  of like Star Trek keyboard, what's in front of you interfaces.
[48:17.920 --> 48:21.440]  The GM isn't really talking much about the user experience.
[48:23.360 --> 48:24.960]  There's like lip service to it.
[48:24.960 --> 48:25.520]  Like that.
[48:25.520 --> 48:25.680]  Yeah.
[48:25.680 --> 48:25.920]  Yeah.
[48:25.920 --> 48:27.920]  That thing about if we control the whole thing.
[48:27.920 --> 48:28.160]  Yeah.
[48:28.160 --> 48:28.400]  Yeah.
[48:28.400 --> 48:30.000]  We'll, we'll, we'll be great.
[48:30.000 --> 48:30.720]  Yeah, sure.
[48:30.720 --> 48:31.360]  Yeah.
[48:31.360 --> 48:35.600]  But then what they really want to talk about is this data collection and it's like, what?
[48:35.600 --> 48:38.960]  And there's something, something they said that I quoted on during Fireball that maybe
[48:38.960 --> 48:41.280]  they'll sell, they want to sell some products, right?
[48:41.280 --> 48:44.640]  Which is where we're going that everybody wants subscription info.
[48:44.640 --> 48:51.520]  They're looking at 20 to $30 billion a year in subscription revenue for services to operate
[48:51.520 --> 48:52.720]  the car you've already bought.
[48:53.280 --> 48:53.520]  Yeah.
[48:54.160 --> 48:56.400]  And one of the things they mentioned was insurance.
[48:56.400 --> 49:00.080]  And I'm like, well, that's, I was thinking stuff like they're, they're going to come
[49:00.080 --> 49:05.920]  out with like GM music or something and, and you'll be able to get something like a Spotify
[49:05.920 --> 49:08.640]  or an Apple or Apple music through GM.
[49:09.280 --> 49:12.080]  And you know, that's how you'll get your music.
[49:12.080 --> 49:17.600]  My ancient Acura has built-in XM radio, right?
[49:17.600 --> 49:22.480]  Which we've subscribed to ever since we bought the car in 2006.
[49:22.480 --> 49:24.000]  So that there'd be something like that.
[49:24.000 --> 49:33.280]  It selling insurance based on the data you collect in the car, that, that seems oppressive,
[49:34.160 --> 49:34.400]  right?
[49:34.400 --> 49:34.560]  Yeah.
[49:35.120 --> 49:35.440]  Yeah.
[49:36.480 --> 49:38.880]  And it's not designed to make the car cheaper.
[49:38.880 --> 49:40.880]  It's designed to increase their profit margin.
[49:40.880 --> 49:44.480]  I mean, if they talked about their profit margin, they expect their profit margin going
[49:44.480 --> 49:46.400]  up from something like 12 to 14% to 20%.
[49:47.040 --> 49:47.520]  Right.
[49:47.520 --> 49:47.920]  Right.
[49:47.920 --> 49:48.720]  Yeah.
[49:48.720 --> 49:52.320]  We're not, we're not, we're not making like, like that used to be a thing that, you know,
[49:52.320 --> 49:53.440]  that's why Android's cheaper.
[49:53.440 --> 49:56.960]  You can get an Android device and we, maybe you're sacrificing some of your personal
[49:56.960 --> 49:58.480]  data, but you're getting a cheaper device.
[49:58.480 --> 50:03.840]  And when it's better for people who can't afford to buy an iPhone, but, but this is
[50:03.840 --> 50:05.280]  just like, no, we're taking it all.
[50:07.040 --> 50:11.360]  A friend of the show, Casey lists, sent me a text message after I posted that to remind
[50:11.360 --> 50:16.800]  me that there have been some deals like that for car insurance for a long time.
[50:16.800 --> 50:17.440]  Oh yeah.
[50:17.440 --> 50:19.840]  You could get a device in your car to, yeah.
[50:19.840 --> 50:24.160]  Yeah, onboard diagnostic OBD two port.
[50:24.160 --> 50:29.040]  It looks like a, like an HDMI port or something.
[50:29.040 --> 50:32.960]  And if you like a house arrest anklet for driving, right.
[50:33.840 --> 50:37.440]  But you can buy, there used to be, I can't, I still can't, I should look it up actually,
[50:37.440 --> 50:43.200]  but decades ago, maybe at this point, long, long time ago, early era of this show, we
[50:43.200 --> 50:49.200]  had a sponsor that has since gone defunct, but it was they sold like a little, like a
[50:49.200 --> 50:54.400]  hundred dollar dingus that you would put on that port, but it wasn't to monitor you or
[50:54.400 --> 50:56.160]  sell you out for advertising.
[50:56.160 --> 51:02.560]  It was like to, to give you, and it had a phone, you get the diagnostics that they could
[51:02.560 --> 51:05.600]  get at the dealer, right in there on your phone.
[51:05.600 --> 51:05.840]  Right.
[51:05.840 --> 51:10.000]  And you'd find out these things that you, you know, your car has all this data and you'd
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.960]  know, yeah, I think I have it in a box.
[51:12.960 --> 51:13.680]  Yeah.
[51:13.680 --> 51:15.760]  I've never used it.
[51:15.760 --> 51:18.080]  I did use it because they were a sponsor.
[51:18.080 --> 51:21.760]  I still can't, I can't remember the name, but anyway, that was though a product all
[51:21.760 --> 51:22.800]  for your benefit.
[51:22.800 --> 51:29.120]  And, and it would give you tips like you could monitor what your gas efficiency is and alter
[51:29.120 --> 51:34.800]  your driving habits to, to get more mileage, you know, by maybe coasting more and not riding
[51:34.800 --> 51:36.640]  the brake up and down or whatever.
[51:37.280 --> 51:41.360]  And there've been other dinguses that you can get from your insurance company, I guess.
[51:41.360 --> 51:45.440]  I've never known anybody who's done this, but that if you voluntarily put this in your
[51:45.440 --> 51:50.240]  car and let the insurance company monitor the information that they'll give you some
[51:50.240 --> 51:51.520]  kind of discount, you know?
[51:51.520 --> 51:51.760]  Yeah.
[51:51.760 --> 51:55.360]  And I think there was, there's also one that parents could do for kids.
[51:55.360 --> 51:59.920]  Yeah, like your, your teenagers learning to drive and, and you don't want them going
[51:59.920 --> 52:01.200]  to the bars and whatever.
[52:01.200 --> 52:05.200]  Well, or maybe you don't want them going, seeing how fast the car can go.
[52:05.200 --> 52:05.440]  Yeah.
[52:07.120 --> 52:08.880]  Basically doing all the stuff that I did when I was.
[52:09.440 --> 52:09.920]  Exactly.
[52:09.920 --> 52:10.320]  Right.
[52:10.320 --> 52:10.960]  Learning to drive.
[52:12.160 --> 52:14.400]  I can't believe I'm alive, honestly.
[52:14.400 --> 52:16.800]  Yeah, man, I almost wasn't several times.
[52:16.800 --> 52:18.240]  I, this is true for me too.
[52:18.240 --> 52:22.320]  I was with buddies and my buddy Todd, he had a, a Mustang.
[52:22.320 --> 52:27.040]  It was an old Mustang and the worst part, it was like one of the ugliest Mustangs Ford
[52:27.040 --> 52:27.600]  ever made.
[52:27.600 --> 52:29.680]  It was like from the, one of the eighties.
[52:29.680 --> 52:29.920]  Yeah.
[52:29.920 --> 52:31.520]  One of the eighties one time.
[52:31.520 --> 52:39.920]  Four of us in a car, I was in the back seat and we were just driving way too fast on rural
[52:39.920 --> 52:44.720]  roads at night with our friend James behind us driving his car.
[52:44.720 --> 52:45.920]  And James is a good driver.
[52:46.720 --> 52:51.440]  And my friend Ethan and I, we just looked at each other and in the back seat and we're
[52:51.440 --> 52:52.800]  like, we're having fun.
[52:52.800 --> 52:53.600]  We weren't drinking.
[52:53.600 --> 52:55.520]  No, no, no substances involved.
[52:55.520 --> 52:59.040]  Just teenage boys driving too fast on a rural road.
[52:59.840 --> 53:02.880]  And we looked at each other and we're like, maybe we should put our seatbelts on.
[53:02.880 --> 53:06.000]  And we, but it was an old eighties car.
[53:06.000 --> 53:12.960]  So it was just lap belts and Todd lost control of the car completely and sailed through,
[53:12.960 --> 53:16.000]  just went through a corn field full of corn.
[53:16.000 --> 53:17.120]  This is like fall.
[53:17.120 --> 53:18.880]  It was like October, early school year.
[53:18.880 --> 53:26.320]  So the corn was big, just shot through the corn at a very high speed and then shot back
[53:26.320 --> 53:27.360]  across the road.
[53:27.360 --> 53:33.520]  I guess he turned the other way and slammed on the brakes and we landed on some kind of,
[53:33.520 --> 53:38.800]  I guess it was very hilly and somebody had built like a driveway in front of their house
[53:38.800 --> 53:40.080]  that was elevated.
[53:40.080 --> 53:44.880]  And so it was like a 20 or 30 foot drop and the car was right at the edge of it.
[53:45.520 --> 53:51.520]  And it had, we'd gone through a fence and there was like barbed wire or something wrapped
[53:51.520 --> 53:54.400]  around the axle and, but we're all okay.
[53:54.400 --> 53:56.560]  And the cars come to a complete stop.
[53:56.560 --> 54:01.440]  Our friends behind us pulled up then and they were all terribly shaken because all they
[54:01.440 --> 54:07.680]  saw was the car disappear into a field and then shoot across in front of them.
[54:08.320 --> 54:09.360]  Everybody's okay.
[54:09.360 --> 54:18.160]  The car is a mess, but then we're greeted by the property owner and we're laughing.
[54:19.200 --> 54:21.120]  You'll never guess what he had in his hands.
[54:22.480 --> 54:25.200]  Oh, I bet it's a shotgun.
[54:25.200 --> 54:25.920]  It was.
[54:25.920 --> 54:27.680]  In fact, it was not just a gun.
[54:27.680 --> 54:28.640]  It was a shotgun.
[54:28.640 --> 54:29.680]  He had a shotgun.
[54:29.680 --> 54:34.720]  Now I, who knows in 2023, what he would have in his hands is probably on it.
[54:34.720 --> 54:39.200]  I mean, we joke, it's probably one of these assault rifles and AR-15 something.
[54:39.200 --> 54:47.280]  But in 1991, it was, or 90, it was a shotgun and it wasn't pointed at us.
[54:47.280 --> 54:53.040]  But he, but we, we, and again, we were a hundred, 0.0 blood alcohol amongst all of us.
[54:53.040 --> 54:56.640]  So we were able to explain ourselves very quickly.
[54:56.640 --> 54:59.280]  He said, well, I don't really, it was very gruff.
[54:59.280 --> 55:03.280]  You know, he's the sort of man who greets this loud bang with a shotgun.
[55:03.280 --> 55:06.080]  But he said, I, I've been looking to get rid of that fence.
[55:06.080 --> 55:09.440]  So no harm, but right.
[55:09.440 --> 55:14.160]  But we were, I mean, we came that close to just sailing over a 30 or 40 foot embankment
[55:14.160 --> 55:18.480]  with lap belts on and who knows what else we might've hit in the field when he lost.
[55:18.480 --> 55:21.920]  Anyway, that's a digression, but probably would have been good to have one of those
[55:21.920 --> 55:23.120]  sticks in Todd's car.
[55:24.240 --> 55:25.520]  Well, actually it probably wouldn't tear.
[55:25.520 --> 55:28.560]  Well, yeah, you probably would have done it anyway.
[55:28.560 --> 55:32.960]  Well, I guess now in hindsight, as I think about it, there was, it didn't matter if
[55:32.960 --> 55:36.880]  there were diagnostics, there was no other explanation for his parents.
[55:38.480 --> 55:39.520]  Now that I think about it.
[55:39.520 --> 55:40.160]  Oh yeah, right.
[55:40.160 --> 55:43.360]  You can, you come home and you've got, yeah, barbed wire wrapped around the car.
[55:43.360 --> 55:43.860]  Right.
[55:44.640 --> 55:46.640]  Probably going to need to do some fast talking.
[55:46.640 --> 55:47.140]  Yeah.
[55:48.400 --> 55:55.360]  But anyway, I, this future of GM sounds to me like they're envisioning a, instead of
[55:55.360 --> 55:59.840]  an opt in stick, which is what we're talking about from before, where you would say, okay,
[55:59.840 --> 56:05.040]  I will take a, you know, an insurance company might say, we're looking for people to drive
[56:05.040 --> 56:10.640]  safely or something like that, or, or which roads you drive on or how much, how many miles
[56:10.640 --> 56:11.520]  you do drive.
[56:11.520 --> 56:12.000]  I don't know.
[56:12.000 --> 56:16.240]  And we'll give you a discount if you stay under these limits, if you put this stick
[56:16.240 --> 56:20.800]  here in your car and if you say, okay, and then you're making this deal with your eyes
[56:20.800 --> 56:21.760]  wide open.
[56:21.760 --> 56:28.000]  I feel like the GM future is going to be monitoring if they continue along this path, monitoring
[56:28.000 --> 56:35.920]  people in a very, in my, I think anti-privacy way to what, badger them?
[56:35.920 --> 56:36.880]  I don't know.
[56:36.880 --> 56:41.520]  And State Farm notices that you're a, you're a great driver and would like you to switch.
[56:41.520 --> 56:43.360]  Is that going to come up on your dashboard?
[56:43.360 --> 56:46.320]  Like as you're driving down the road.
[56:46.320 --> 56:46.820]  Right.
[56:47.040 --> 56:48.720]  When you're driving through a cornfield.
[56:48.720 --> 56:48.960]  Right.
[56:48.960 --> 56:53.840]  Thanks to some sort of promotion where surely GM would be taking it for whatever number
[56:53.840 --> 56:58.480]  of people switch their insurance based on this information, GM gets a cut.
[56:59.360 --> 56:59.600]  Yeah.
[56:59.600 --> 57:00.080]  I don't know.
[57:00.080 --> 57:02.240]  I wonder if how well this is going to work out for them though.
[57:02.240 --> 57:08.640]  I mean, I personally, I don't have CarPlay in my current car, but I definitely want to
[57:08.640 --> 57:10.080]  get it in my next car.
[57:10.080 --> 57:13.760]  And I am, that is definitely a deciding factor.
[57:13.760 --> 57:17.600]  So, but I don't think that I'm probably most people.
[57:17.600 --> 57:18.100]  Right.
[57:18.100 --> 57:25.940]  And maybe, maybe, maybe it will work for them, but I doubt that their user experience is
[57:25.940 --> 57:29.380]  going to be all that great, particularly.
[57:29.380 --> 57:30.980]  I doubt it too.
[57:30.980 --> 57:35.060]  And the one thing I have in my mind, I think I wrote about this on Daring Fireball, but
[57:35.060 --> 57:40.900]  the one thing that's different about, well, Tesla doesn't really have this problem because
[57:40.900 --> 57:44.740]  of their newfangled-ness from top to bottom.
[57:44.740 --> 57:53.060]  But for the traditional car makers, the role of the car dealer is unlike, in my opinion,
[57:53.060 --> 57:59.220]  I can't think of an analogy to any other product that you buy like this, where you don't go.
[57:59.220 --> 58:04.180]  You, you can buy your iPhone from Verizon.
[58:04.180 --> 58:07.940]  You can buy it from Best Buy, right?
[58:07.940 --> 58:13.380]  You can go, you don't have to buy your iPhone directly from Apple, but those are just stores
[58:13.380 --> 58:17.940]  and you don't have salesmen, or I don't know, maybe you do, I guess, in a Verizon store.
[58:17.940 --> 58:19.220]  There's probably some commission or something.
[58:19.220 --> 58:21.060]  Yeah, but it's not like buying a car.
[58:21.060 --> 58:24.260]  And you can, you can just buy directly from Apple.
[58:24.260 --> 58:29.060]  But when you go to buy a Chevy Bolt, you have to go to your local Chevrolet dealer, which
[58:29.060 --> 58:31.540]  is an independently owned business.
[58:31.540 --> 58:35.860]  You know, and that's, it's like an antitrust decision from, I don't know, 100 years ago
[58:35.860 --> 58:40.340]  or early, the 1940s, or I don't know when they put it into place.
[58:40.340 --> 58:45.380]  But before we were born, so I've never known the world where you don't have this, but there's
[58:46.100 --> 58:51.540]  like in the US, laws that keep Chevy and Ford from owning the car dealers.
[58:51.540 --> 58:55.060]  Like legally, they have to be owned by third parties.
[58:55.060 --> 59:00.660]  We've often by like local, they become local celebrities through their TV ads, right?
[59:00.660 --> 59:04.660]  Like everybody knows the jingle from certain car dealers.
[59:04.660 --> 59:11.780]  There's, we've got one here in Philly, whose slogan for 30, 40 years, Gary Barbera, he
[59:11.780 --> 59:12.900]  sells Dodges.
[59:13.780 --> 59:15.700]  Is Barbera the best?
[59:15.700 --> 59:16.900]  Boy, I guess.
[59:16.900 --> 59:20.660]  That's, I swear to, swear to God.
[59:21.220 --> 59:22.180]  That's, I don't know.
[59:23.780 --> 59:25.540]  Is Barbera the best?
[59:25.540 --> 59:26.980]  Boy, I guess.
[59:26.980 --> 59:29.460]  But it's a weird slogan.
[59:29.460 --> 59:35.060]  But if you heard the voice, the narrator is a very deep baritone, confident man.
[59:35.060 --> 59:40.180]  So I guess his confidence in the line really sells you on Gary Barbera.
[59:40.180 --> 59:45.380]  But we've got a bunch of car dealers here in Philly that are owned by Mike Piazza, former
[59:45.380 --> 59:50.820]  baseball star, who never played for the Phillies, but he was born and raised in the area and
[59:50.820 --> 59:52.980]  now owns a bunch of car dealerships.
[59:54.420 --> 59:56.100]  Met stature for years.
[59:56.100 --> 59:59.700]  Right, Mets famously, I guess, most famously for the Mets.
[59:59.700 --> 01:00:04.660]  But the gist, but when you go to buy a car, you don't buy, you can't buy a car from GM,
[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:04.980]  right?
[01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:06.100]  It's like a legal thing.
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.100]  And it probably ought to be looked at.
[01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:09.060]  I don't really think.
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:11.380]  Did Saturn sell directly though?
[01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:12.900]  Yeah, maybe.
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:13.860]  It felt like Saturn.
[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.060]  I mean, that was their whole thing.
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:16.340]  Like they had a different deal.
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:20.900]  And I don't know if that worked, but I mean, I know that they didn't do haggling, right?
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:24.980]  You had, you got the price, that was the price, but I don't know if the dealerships were
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:26.100]  owned separately or not.
[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:30.660]  Yeah, but that's why I want, but yeah, but that was the story.
[01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:35.940]  It was because they made a new brand that they were allowed to do that, right?
[01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:39.700]  So like Saturn, because Saturn was a new label.
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:42.340]  And again, it's all just sort of, what's the difference?
[01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:43.940]  They're all owned by GM.
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:46.980]  So what's the sub brands are kind of a weird thing.
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:51.460]  But yeah, they and again, I don't know what people, I don't know what the car buying
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:56.740]  experience like is for our friends listening over in the UK and Germany and the rest of
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:57.220]  Europe.
[01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:05.620]  But here, because of this car dealer relationship, it is a product that famously, you don't
[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.780]  really know what the prices of the product.
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:10.180]  You go to the lot and you see the car.
[01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:12.500]  Like I would like to buy that car.
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.420]  I like, that's the model I was looking at.
[01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:15.220]  I like the color.
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:19.300]  And then there's like a piece of paper stuck to the windshield.
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.620]  Which means nothing.
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:22.180]  Yeah.
[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:25.300]  And it lists certain features the car has.
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:29.940]  It's got a 3.2 liter engine and it's got this and that.
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:35.300]  And it's got the seat package to get you the better seats or whatever.
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:39.380]  And then there is a dollar sign and a price at the bottom.
[01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:43.700]  But you're not supposed to pay that price.
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:49.220]  And they might tell you, like during COVID, when cars production was all jammed up and
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:54.420]  it was hard to buy cars, they might tell you right to your face, you have to pay more than
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:54.660]  that.
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:56.100]  Yeah, you have to.
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:02:00.340]  Literally, there's nothing you can do or say that is going to get this car off the lot
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:01.380]  at that price.
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:04.980]  It's going to be $10,000 more or $5,000 more or something like that.
[01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:11.700]  In normal times when production isn't jammed up, I guess, again, I've only bought one new
[01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:13.780]  car in my life because I just don't drive that much.
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:21.300]  And I did a really dumb thing where we went to buy that car in 2006 after our previous
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:27.380]  car was at a point of collapse to the point where I wasn't sure we could make it to the
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:28.020]  car dealer.
[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:32.180]  My wife was like, I don't know if we should be driving this car.
[01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:34.100]  I was like, well, they'll give us some money for it.
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:35.380]  So we've got to get it there.
[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:41.620]  It worked out, but I kind of needed to buy the car, which is not the position you're
[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:42.580]  supposed to be in.
[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:42.980]  No, yeah.
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.820]  You always want to be able to walk off the lot.
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:45.300]  Right.
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:50.820]  But the sticker says the car costs $40,000, and you're supposed to say, I'll give you
[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:52.340]  $35,000 right now.
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:54.420]  And they say, I can't do that.
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:55.300]  My God, let me go.
[01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:59.540]  And then I'll go talk to my manager, and my manager has good news for you.
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:02.420]  He's going to take it down to $39,000.
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:03.860]  But that's our best offer.
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:05.700]  And then you're supposed to leave in a huff.
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:08.980]  You're like, I'm going to the Honda dealer.
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:13.380]  And then the guy's like, yeah.
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:15.140]  And the guy's like, well, give me your phone number.
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:15.780]  They'll call you.
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:16.420]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:21.300]  That's a ridiculous dance that you have to do.
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:25.940]  We went, when we bought the first one, we went together, which was a mistake, because
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:30.740]  the second time, first, then you get in arguments, and then they're playing you against each
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:30.900]  other.
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:34.260]  And it's like, the second time, I was like, no, I'm going by myself.
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:39.940]  And I was able to use her as an excuse, because I'm going to go talk to my manager.
[01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:41.380]  They're like, well, I got to go talk to my wife.
[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:42.260]  I mean, I can't.
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:44.420]  You use your wife as the manager.
[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:46.580]  I got to clear it with her first, man.
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:47.700]  I mean, you got your manager.
[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:48.340]  I got my wife.
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:50.420]  We'll get there eventually.
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:58.660]  But then these are professionals, and they get paid by commission to some extent so that
[01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:02.660]  the sales person who sells more cars makes more money.
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:07.060]  And it's what they do all day, every day, right?
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:11.780]  And so a rube like me, I know these things.
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:16.580]  I'm at least not a complete ignorant rube who comes in and just says, oh, you say that's
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:17.140]  the price.
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:18.500]  OK, here you go.
[01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:20.100]  I know you got to haggle.
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:23.780]  And I know you got to do some, look it up in the Kelly Blue Book, what you're supposed
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:24.340]  to pay.
[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:31.220]  And you're supposed to call other dealers if you're shopping for a Toyota.
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:35.220]  You call three or four Toyota dealers and see who gives you blah, blah, blah.
[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:38.340]  But of course, I did this once in my adult life.
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:41.140]  I'm probably going to do it again soon.
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:42.580]  But how many of these am I going to buy?
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:48.980]  Whereas the car dealer, five days a week, eight hours a day, over and over, this is
[01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:49.780]  what they do.
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:58.420]  And if they're good at it and enjoy it enough to keep doing it, they're going to get better
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:04:58.980]  at it, right?
[01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:03.380]  It's the Malcolm Gladwell thing, 10,000 hours of selling cars.
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:06.420]  And all of a sudden, you're the Paul McCartney of car salesmen, right?
[01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:08.420]  Something, something.
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:12.340]  But they smell things like that because they're good at it.
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:16.980]  And they smell things like, oh, the wife really likes this car.
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:19.700]  Ah, yeah.
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:22.260]  And she's kind of thinking, I could see it.
[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:26.900]  She's kind of thinking, this guy's being cheap and they should just buy it.
[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:28.020]  What are you waiting for?
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:30.180]  And then they know how to work that.
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:32.420]  It's all, it's a weird thing.
[01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:36.420]  I used a broker one time, which was really pretty good, actually.
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:38.580]  You have to pay like, it was a few hundred dollars.
[01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:39.620]  I think it was like three or five.
[01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:40.180]  I can't remember.
[01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:44.900]  But in a lot of ways, it's worth it enough to go through the aggravation.
[01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.260]  And it was relatively quick.
[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:46.900]  Yeah.
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:49.060]  There's brokers you can use, which sounds good.
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:53.300]  And again, these are, it's for most people, it is by far and away,
[01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:56.180]  the second most expensive thing they're ever going to purchase, right?
[01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:58.500]  Your home is the most expensive.
[01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:01.780]  And then this, we, we talk about this Apple stuff all the time,
[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:09.780]  but are even my very expensive maxed out MacBook pro was like $5,000, right?
[01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:11.540]  And that's, I got a MacBook pro.
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:14.740]  I didn't get the 16 inch, so I would have had to pay more,
[01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:20.340]  but I got the most RAM and the biggest SSD and the fastest processor I could.
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:21.860]  That's $5,000, right?
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:25.860]  So yeah, cars are 48th of a really good, of a good car.
[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:26.360]  Yeah.
[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:28.740]  But it's kind of nutty.
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:32.740]  Nobody would buy a house without going through professional,
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:35.780]  like realtor who's on your side, right?
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:38.420]  And again, I hope people do.
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:39.140]  People do.
[01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:41.940]  I mean, I think that does happen, but yeah, I wouldn't do it.
[01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:43.460]  Well, yeah, I shouldn't say never.
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:47.220]  But the people who do it at least think they themselves are expert enough to do it.
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:47.720]  Right.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:52.420]  And whereas you probably shouldn't be going on to a lot and buying a car without some kind of broke.
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:55.700]  And again, somebody who you pay a couple of hundred dollars to,
[01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:58.500]  who can save you a couple of thousand dollars.
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:06:59.540]  Yeah, right, right.
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:01.620]  And it's, it's like, Oh, this is good.
[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:02.740]  You know, it's a question of your time.
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:03.940]  What's your time worth too?
[01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:06.100]  Yeah, this is how, Oh, this is how business works.
[01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:06.420]  I see.
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:08.180]  You're supposed to, you're supposed to make money.
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:10.580]  But it's weird here in the United States because nothing else works the same.
[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:11.620]  No, nothing works.
[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:16.100]  Whereas you go like going to Hong Kong and haggled over things in the street and stuff like that.
[01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:20.500]  And you go, you go other places and lots of other places in the world and you haggle over things.
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:23.780]  But here in the U S cars are the only thing.
[01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:24.100]  Right.
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:25.620]  And it's good houses, I guess.
[01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:33.220]  But you know, that's between two, two parties or two people rather than a business and a person.
[01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:33.940]  So I don't know.
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:38.180]  I just, it just seems to me like GM is heading into a dark place that they've,
[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:43.700]  they've looked at, they've looked at the possibility of the computerization of cars,
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:50.100]  which, you know, every everything that's the overarching theme of the whole world for the
[01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:56.100]  last few decades is everything is turning into computers and it gives us stuff to talk about
[01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:57.220]  and write about.
[01:07:57.220 --> 01:08:03.940]  And, but it, it leads to dark places when, when you start thinking about things like,
[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:07.380]  Oh, we'll collect every single bit of data about how they drive their car
[01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:10.340]  and when and where they've gone and how fast they've gone.
[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:13.540]  And I guess, is there who, who was driving?
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:16.740]  If there's some kind of connection to your phone with Bluetooth,
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:20.900]  even though it's not carplay, they could know who's the driver or I'm sure there are.
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:21.140]  Yeah.
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:22.740]  There are other ways they can figure it out.
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:23.380]  Yeah.
[01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:23.620]  Yeah.
[01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:28.180]  There's, it's, it's not hard to think of ways to figure this out and you start down that path
[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:35.460]  and it just feels not a good place, but I guess, and as much as we complain about it,
[01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:39.300]  all of these other ways that computers have made experiences worse.
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:43.780]  I keep complaining about them, but they, they keep happening.
[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:52.500]  My big one, my big one is the computerization of TV, which started with, to me with like TiVo
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.900]  and what was the TiVo rival?
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:55.700]  I always forget.
[01:08:55.700 --> 01:09:01.220]  Cause I, I joined team TiVo very early on, but like in the late nineties when they DVRs
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:06.500]  were brand new, it was TiVo and some other company that didn't make it.
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:11.620]  But the, and the big deal was the other one had a 30 second skip button and TiVo never
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:16.980]  added a 30 seconds or they did very, very recently, which is a digression I should save
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:21.380]  for when my fellow TiVo user, John, John Siracusa is on the show.
[01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:25.940]  But the gist of it was you'd buy TiVo's and the other one.
[01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:32.340]  And the idea was this makes your TV so much better for you because you can record all
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:35.300]  of your favorite shows and you subscribe to them.
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:40.740]  So you don't have to memorize, Oh, like with a VCR, the dream of, Oh, I'll just always
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:43.300]  record my favorite show every Tuesday night at nine.
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:47.380]  You've always got to have a fresh tape, the right tape in there.
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:53.220]  And the programming of the VCR was notoriously bad, right?
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:59.300]  Like it was a recurring standup bit for decades that everybody's VCR just blink 12 oh, oh,
[01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:02.100]  because nobody even knew how to set the time on the damn thing.
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:07.780]  And we effectively just used our, most of us used our VCRs to play movies.
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:11.140]  You'd go to the blockbuster and get a movie and put it in play.
[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:16.820]  The recording was such a pain because tapes sucked and the TiVo is just, no, just tell
[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:20.180]  it that your favorite show is NYPD blue from the nineties.
[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:25.300]  And, and now every night, every week, it'll just automatically record and it'll be there
[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:26.980]  and you can watch it on your time.
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:29.380]  And there is a fast forward button.
[01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:34.420]  So if there are parts of the show, like the ads that you would like to skip, you just
[01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:37.220]  go blip, blip, blip, and then you go right past them.
[01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:41.620]  And anyway, the computer was there to just improve it for you.
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:46.420]  You watch the shows when you watch instead of when they're broadcast and you have a fast
[01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:49.300]  forward and rewind and pause button, right?
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:51.300]  The pause itself was breakthrough.
[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:55.780]  Like it used to be, you'd be watching something and you had to, had to go to the bathroom.
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:57.620]  You'd just be like, Oh God, what am I going to do?
[01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:04.660]  And it, we've come around to the fact now where computers are being used for streaming
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:06.980]  to show you ads you can't skip, right?
[01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:11.060]  That's, they're like, well, we'll solve this problem.
[01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:13.780]  We'll, we'll make this ad unskippable.
[01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:19.540]  And, and you're, even though you pay some amount of money for this level of Hulu or
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:24.180]  whatever, because your level includes ads, they're unskippable.
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:28.020]  You can fast forward the show as much as you want.
[01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:28.740]  All you want.
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:28.980]  Yeah.
[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:29.380]  Right.
[01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:31.540]  Skip the show if you want to, but you have to watch the ad.
[01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:32.340]  All right.
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:37.300]  And my wife watches a couple of shows on, I think it's Peacock, which she, and she
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:41.780]  watches enough of these things where she's got better opinions about, about the streaming
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:42.820]  services than I do.
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:49.140]  And she's figured out, like, if she pauses the show halfway through, it'll remember
[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:53.620]  where she was, but it won't, it won't give her credit for the ads she's already watched
[01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:57.140]  if she waits like 48 hours before watching again.
[01:11:57.140 --> 01:12:02.260]  And then all of a sudden she has to watch the same unskippable ads she already had seen.
[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:05.860]  And then she just wants to throw the Apple TV remote out the window.
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:11.620]  But that's where we've gone is it's, it's clearly unskippable ads through a computer.
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:15.380]  It is anti user.
[01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:15.620]  Right.
[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:20.660]  And you know, the thinking behind it, it's well that if we don't make them unskippable,
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:21.780]  people will skip them.
[01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:24.260]  Oh yeah, for sure.
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:25.060]  Yeah.
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:30.820]  The worst was always, speaking of a Biff, I would watch these shows on the superhero
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:32.180]  shows on the CW.
[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:36.260]  And a lot of times I would bet this was a while ago, I used to buy some of them off
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:40.020]  of iTunes, but, but there were others that I was watching for the show that I didn't
[01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:41.140]  want to own or whatever.
[01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:43.940]  And so I would watch it on their, on the CW app.
[01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:48.740]  And I think they were, they were challenged to get advertisers a lot.
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:51.700]  It's like, it would always be like, you get a detergent ad or something like that.
[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:56.180]  And then, but then they would show you ads for their own shows and often they would show
[01:12:56.180 --> 01:13:00.260]  you the ad for the show that you're watching, which I always thought was hilarious.
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:02.580]  It's like, I am literally watching this show right now.
[01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:06.580]  Why are you showing me an unskippable ad for the same show that I'm watching?
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:10.420]  I did anyway.
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:16.500]  I think unskippable ads are coming soon to a car from General Motors near you.
[01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:17.220]  I really do.
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:20.660]  And it's, I don't know.
[01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:21.940]  It's just, yeah.
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:22.820]  Again, I'll complain.
[01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:24.020]  I'm complaining now.
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:25.300]  I'll complain when it happens.
[01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:27.300]  I won't buy one of their get go.
[01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:27.800]  Right.
[01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:29.060]  I guess.
[01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:32.340]  And the problem, and again, I don't even rent cars very frequently.
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:35.860]  A lot of times when I travel, like a lot, most of the time, when I go to California
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:38.980]  for Apple type things, I don't rent a car because I don't really need one.
[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:44.900]  I just take an Uber or a cab from the airport, just use Uber everywhere.
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:47.140]  But I do rent cars sometimes.
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:53.140]  And that's a lot of times my personal experience driving General Motors vehicles through rental
[01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:53.860]  cars.
[01:13:53.860 --> 01:14:02.980]  I'm not looking forward to winding up with a car that doesn't have car play and shows
[01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:03.620]  me ads.
[01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:07.700]  I mean, because you can only imagine that the rental cars will have a different version
[01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:11.620]  of the operating system optimized for renters for rental cars.
[01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:12.120]  Right.
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:14.180]  That would be interesting.
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:14.420]  Yeah.
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:16.260]  That will be interesting to see if that's what happens.
[01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:23.540]  It's a bit, but it's a bad set of user experiences all the way down.
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:24.180]  It really is.
[01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:24.420]  All right.
[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:27.860]  Let me take a break here and talk about a good user experience.
[01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:31.300]  How's that for a segue with our good friends at Squarespace.
[01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:38.180]  Squarespace is the all in one website publishing service.
[01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:44.900]  Everything that you might need to have your own website with your own brand, your own
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:49.860]  features, your own information on the website, everything can go through Squarespace.
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:56.660]  They've from the domain name registration to picking templates from hundreds of professionally
[01:14:56.660 --> 01:15:02.020]  designed templates to start with that you can tweak to your heart's desire right in
[01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:05.860]  the browser, dragging, dropping all visual.
[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:10.660]  You don't need to know any coding at all, but if you do know coding, you can get to
[01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:15.940]  it so you can look at the HTML, you can look at the CSS, you can adjust things like that.
[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:17.060]  They've got other features.
[01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:18.340]  They've got member areas.
[01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:22.660]  They make it easy for creators to monetize their content and expertise in a way that
[01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:25.540]  fits their brand with member areas on your website.
[01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:29.140]  You can unlock a new revenue stream for your business and free up time in your schedule
[01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:35.700]  by selling access to gated content like videos or online courses or newsletters that you
[01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:37.780]  only want to go to your paying subscribers.
[01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:40.660]  You could do that all through Squarespace online stores.
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:44.820]  If you want stuff, if you have stuff to sell, you want to set up a store that Squarespace
[01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:47.060]  specializes in that you could do it all through there.
[01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:52.820]  I know that a lot of a lot of people who run service oriented businesses like a personal
[01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:58.900]  trainer who does one on one sessions remotely, you could do that all through Squarespace
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:04.020]  and sell your time not just to like a whole audience, but for like one on one sessions,
[01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:04.980]  that sort of thing.
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:07.060]  All of it through Squarespace.
[01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:08.580]  It's just a fantastic service.
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:14.340]  They keep sponsoring the show because people from this show keep going to Squarespace at
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:18.900]  their special URL, squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:23.060]  You go there squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:28.500]  You get a free trial, 30 days, no limits, no watermarks on the site.
[01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:30.820]  You just have the full access to see what it's like.
[01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:34.260]  And then when you're ready to launch, use that same offer code talk show.
[01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:40.660]  No, the just talk show and save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain at squarespace.com
[01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:42.100]  slash talk show.
[01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:45.620]  I talk about Squarespace a lot, John.
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:47.380]  I do.
[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:48.340]  They're great.
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:52.260]  It's very, very pleasing to me that they're continuing sponsor.
[01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:56.660]  But it doesn't make sense to me.
[01:16:56.660 --> 01:17:01.140]  I feel like well, it's like, yeah, it's the easiest way to set up your website.
[01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:10.020]  I had one other thing that I wanted to talk to you about, which was we talked about the
[01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:10.660]  car play.
[01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:11.700]  Huh?
[01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:14.900]  Well, what's on your list?
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:15.780]  Was it blue sky?
[01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:17.060]  We could.
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:17.780]  Do you want to talk?
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:19.380]  Well, we could talk a little bit.
[01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:23.220]  I'm not an expert, but did you get in on the blue sky?
[01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:24.020]  I am in.
[01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:24.980]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:27.940]  And I'm mostly just lurking at this point.
[01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:33.220]  And it really did blow up this past week because it seemed like it was as far as the people
[01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:38.820]  that I follow, which was not many to begin at the beginning of the week and is significantly
[01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:44.500]  more now, there was really just one guy who was going before this week.
[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:47.700]  And now there's a lot more traffic.
[01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:48.980]  I will say that for sure.
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:53.460]  They seem to be for the most part, it's a lot of tech people.
[01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:55.540]  I think it's a lot of Twitter people.
[01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:58.100]  It's a lot of tech people at other tech companies.
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:04.740]  And it's not a lot of people, at least the people who are most vocal on there are not
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:09.220]  the people that I interact with the most currently.
[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:14.740]  At any rate, the basic idea is it is a good name, even I think blue sky.
[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:29.860]  But back before the empire, back in the dark days, before the emperor, Twitter had under
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:37.940]  Jack Dorsey's leadership started this blue sky project to sort of re-envision Twitter
[01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:46.180]  as a open protocol public service that wouldn't be centralized under one company's control
[01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:50.740]  like Twitter, like Instagram, like Facebook, right?
[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:51.800]  Yeah.
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:56.500]  Which is funny because a lot of people had asked me for codes like, I want to get my name.
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:59.700]  And I was like, okay, you can, but it's basically the same thing as Mastodon.
[01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:01.540]  You're getting your name on a particular server.
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:09.860]  Yeah, I had an impression of blue sky when it was announced that I've met Jack Dorsey
[01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:11.700]  once or twice.
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:17.300]  He was at an Apple event a couple of years ago and I said hi to him back in the very
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:19.140]  early years of Daring Fireball.
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:24.740]  He sent me some, and he's always been obsessed with very clever domains.
[01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:29.140]  I think he had something like gu.st.
[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:35.860]  And anyway, when he was just like an engineer working at Odeo, the company that started
[01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:40.020]  Twitter, maybe even before he was hired there, he was just sort of an interesting fellow.
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:48.500]  But he wrote, after I invented Markdown, he wrote a little Mac utility that would create
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:54.820]  a system service that would process Markdown in any app.
[01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:55.700]  It was super clever.
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:59.140]  I actually used a bunch of better ways to do it now.
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:00.500]  You could do it through Automator.
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:04.900]  I'm sure you could do it through shortcuts too now and just pick your own Markdown.
[01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:08.340]  There's a dozen ways to do it, but Automator didn't exist at the time.
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:10.740]  So it wasn't easy.
[01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:16.420]  Even though Macs had Pearl and Still Do built in, there wasn't an easy way.
[01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:19.380]  Anyway, Jack Dorsey did that and sent me an email about it.
[01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:21.860]  So I know him a little bit.
[01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:29.140]  But my impression of him is that he's like a lot of very, very successful people.
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:30.740]  He's just very unusual.
[01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:34.340]  And he does sort of have, I think, very clear...
[01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:41.300]  I mean, I think he said this publicly, but he aspires to a certain...
[01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:43.620]  What's the word?
[01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:45.300]  Idealism.
[01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:46.740]  He's an idealist, right?
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:55.300]  And I think he could see what a mess Twitter had sort of become and had an idea in his
[01:20:55.300 --> 01:21:03.300]  head for a sort of utopian alternative that would be open for all the reasons that open
[01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:06.020]  is better than closed for social networking.
[01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:07.300]  There's lots of trade-offs.
[01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:07.940]  Yeah.
[01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:09.220]  And that Blue Sky was the problem.
[01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:11.620]  And I just thought, this is never going to come to fruition.
[01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:16.980]  This is a fan, and he's too idealistic at a certain level.
[01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:20.500]  You need to be practical to actually get something to launch.
[01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:23.060]  And I didn't think anything would come of it.
[01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:26.420]  I don't know if anything ever would have come with it if...
[01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:28.900]  Yeah, I'm definitely not convinced at this point.
[01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:31.140]  Like I said, it's taking off now.
[01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:33.620]  Definitely, it's definitely having a moment at this point.
[01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:34.900]  But it seems...
[01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:39.380]  I said this someplace I don't remember where, but it seems like it is the answer if you
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:41.620]  think Twitter's problems were technical.
[01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:42.900]  Maybe.
[01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:45.140]  And they're really...
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:46.100]  I mean, they are.
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:48.500]  Some of them definitely were, for sure.
[01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:52.340]  And maybe this is an answer for those problems, but it's definitely not been an answer, I
[01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:54.100]  don't think, for many other problems.
[01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:55.140]  Because they've had a whole bunch...
[01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:55.860]  They've already had...
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:22:00.740]  First of all, you can't block anybody unless they just recently added that.
[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:07.060]  But they had a problem because their invite codes were apparently not long enough, and
[01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:12.340]  people were... Bad actors were brute-forcing them and getting onto the platform and making
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:15.540]  it miserable for certain people.
[01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:17.940]  Well, and I think that's the idealism showing through.
[01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:23.380]  And I know it's not Jack Dorsey who coded that, but I think there's a certain...
[01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:26.100]  Hey, why make these invite codes...
[01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:27.540]  I think there were URLs.
[01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:28.740]  Guys, I just got...
[01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:29.140]  Pretty...
[01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:30.020]  Something like that, yeah.
[01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:33.620]  Because the first two, there were like three sections, and the first two were just like
[01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:35.780]  Blue Sky, whatever the main name is.
[01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:36.280]  Yeah.
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:37.800]  I've always thought...
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:38.840]  Yeah, this is a good topic.
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:39.880]  I'm glad we're talking about it.
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:44.360]  Because I've always been fascinated by the mystery of traction.
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:49.480]  How does a product or service gain traction?
[01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:53.400]  And then once it does gain traction, how do you keep it going?
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:23:02.840]  And there are certain things that become so institutionalized in our culture that you
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:05.240]  just don't even think about it anymore, right?
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:10.760]  I don't want to go on a long tangent about Fox News and Tucker Carlson and all the fun
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:12.120]  and adventures they've had.
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:20.600]  But with all the recent news about them canning Tucker Carlson, it just reminded me again
[01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:23.880]  of just how weird a thing cable news is.
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:25.800]  It's a very weird product.
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:31.800]  And everybody who has cable TV, you've got MSNBC and CNN and Fox News, and they've got
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:37.400]  financial channels, and they just show news all the time, even though there's not that
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.280]  much news.
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:43.480]  And so they're just constantly, if you flip to them in the middle of the day, constantly
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:47.880]  trying to subtly convince you that there's something important going on that you need
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:54.440]  to know about and stay tuned because you're never going to believe what's going on on
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:56.360]  Capitol Hill, but we've got a reporter there.
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:58.680]  But it has traction.
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:01.320]  Cable news, it is.
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:05.000]  It surprises me how long it has retained that traction, too.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:11.160]  I mean, I haven't subscribed to a cable package in, well, we did for a while when Karen's
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:12.840]  dad was living here because he wanted to watch sports.
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:20.760]  But since then, prior to that and since then, for 15 years or something like that, I don't
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:21.880]  know, maybe it's not that long.
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:22.840]  It seems like it's been that long.
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:25.240]  But I've not subscribed to a cable package.
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:30.280]  Speaking of sports, how about the pickleball, right?
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:32.920]  You have you played pickleball?
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:35.880]  Pickleball a long time ago.
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:36.120]  All right.
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:43.080]  I played pickleball like 35 years ago, probably the first time I remember it distinctly.
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:49.800]  So for those of you, if you don't know, pickleball is sort of like if tennis and ping pong had
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:50.280]  a baby.
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:58.360]  So it's like I think by area, a pickleball court is one third of the size of a tennis
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:24:59.080]  court.
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:03.880]  And you play with like a wiffle ball, like a softball size plastic ball, and you have
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:07.160]  hard like plastic paddles.
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:09.240]  And so you're playing a game.
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:12.600]  It's like plastic paddles hitting a plastic ball.
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:17.320]  So it's got like a ping pong like sound, but it's you're not at a table.
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:21.960]  You're on a court and you can work up a sweat, and it's sort of a tennis size net.
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:24.920]  And here in the US, it's taking off.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:27.240]  It's very, very popular.
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:28.440]  I is wild, right?
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:32.600]  I mean, because like I said, I played it 35 years ago, and then now I'm reading like pickleball
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:34.200]  takes sweeping the country.
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:36.360]  Yeah, it's sweeping the country.
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:41.800]  And they're doing things like public parks are repurposing tennis courts to be pickleball
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:43.880]  courts because there's demand for it.
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:50.440]  But the tennis players are annoyed because pickleball makes it makes a clacking noise.
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:52.680]  Some people are with their pickleball, right?
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:55.480]  They're annoyed by the clacking noises or something like that.
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:56.520]  Or maybe they're annoyed.
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:02.200]  It's easier to play because the ball is sort of less reactive and like a tennis ball.
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:07.000]  It's not going to go flying off into the distance if you hit it the wrong way, right?
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:07.480]  Right.
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:07.880]  Yeah.
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:11.560]  Whereas the tennis ball fame, I played some tennis when I was younger.
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:17.800]  And yes, sometimes even when you hit it, you hit it and it just you can use a tennis ball.
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:20.280]  Yeah, you got to bring a lot of tennis balls to the tennis court.
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:20.680]  You do.
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:22.520]  And yeah, you really could.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:24.200]  You're not going to lose the pickleball.
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:25.000]  You're not going to lose.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.720]  I want I have not played it, but I do.
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:29.640]  I used to play some tennis.
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:30.360]  I was not good.
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:36.280]  I was very didn't play like on the team, but I was athletic enough that I could credibly
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:36.780]  play.
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:38.200]  I could serve.
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:38.920]  I could hit a ball.
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:45.480]  I played because I played baseball, I can I had some fundamental athletic ability to
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:49.160]  hit a fast moving small ball with a stick as it comes at me.
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:50.360]  Thanks to baseball.
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:55.640]  Mostly I used to be very good at ping pong as a like, I don't know, 11, 11 year old or
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:56.040]  something.
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:27:01.000]  I won some kind of county tournament for like, I don't know.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:06.280]  It wasn't like I was like into ping pong, but like you'd go to the local playground
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:10.200]  and if you won your local playgrounds ping pong tournament, you could play kids from
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:11.720]  other areas and I beat them.
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:15.480]  Yeah, I'm pretty good at ping pong and I need to get in shape.
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:22.360]  So this pickleball looks like and I like and competition is a thing like I used to play
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:25.560]  recreational basketball until I got too old.
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:27.640]  Maybe I'll get back into that and play old man.
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:30.600]  Slow low to the ground basketball, right?
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:33.080]  Yeah, like basketball.
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:39.160]  Yeah, basketball is the older you get, the more it's more like a soccer.
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:39.800]  It just stays.
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:42.040]  Everything's low.
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:45.720]  Everything's low until somebody shoots the ball and then the ball falls to the ground
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:46.680]  and drops.
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:51.480]  But I realize I need competition to drive me to exercise.
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:57.640]  I just don't have it in me to get on a stationary bike and just pedal.
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:59.240]  I'm not going to do it now.
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:03.080]  I'm old and I don't know about you, but I keep getting older every year.
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:07.160]  Yeah, I say it beat the alternative, but I'm not.
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:11.800]  But anyway, wondering pickleball looks like something I would very much enjoy.
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:16.040]  I like the competition that looks like I'd work up a sweat and our local the gym.
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:20.600]  We had a gym that's a couple blocks away from us that closed during the pandemic for
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:27.160]  the obvious reason, and then they took advantage of that to close for an extended period of
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:30.840]  time to do major renovations that they'd been planning for deck.
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:35.880]  You live in the city and it's harder to do major construction.
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:39.480]  And they're just reopening one of the bigs.
[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:41.240]  It's like they got this.
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:42.680]  They got that pickleball, pickleball.
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:43.560]  We've got pickleball now.
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.880]  Now we did not have pickleball before.
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:50.760]  Lots of you mentioned it before that we did not have pickleball, and now we've got pickleball.
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:54.040]  I'm into it, but I'm fascinated.
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:55.480]  The sport is not new.
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:59.080]  You yourself just said it came from the West Coast.
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:01.160]  So that's probably why you were familiar with it.
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:07.960]  I mean, when I was in college, I spent my junior year in Japan and I stopped in Seattle
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:09.880]  on my way back mid 80s.
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:13.000]  And that was the first time I played pickleball was in Seattle.
[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:15.640]  I'd never heard of it.
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:17.080]  It's underhand serving.
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:19.720]  So there's again, the ball's not moving 100 miles an hour.
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:20.440]  Right after work.
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:24.200]  It's designed to be something that's easy to pick up and probably like ping pong.
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:25.560]  You can probably get rid of that.
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:31.160]  I think you see people playing professional ping pong and you're like, Oh my God, there's
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:35.960]  definitely a difference between the average player and people who get really, really good
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:36.200]  at it.
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:37.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.600]  Somehow I've gotten I don't know how because I didn't ask for it.
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:44.920]  But you know how when you check Instagram, it's like all of a sudden Instagram thinks
[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:46.120]  you're into blank.
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:49.640]  Well, Instagram thinks I'm into ping pong now and they show me.
[01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:57.160]  And of course, the only ping pong clips that make it into a suggested what do they call
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:57.320]  them?
[01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:58.120]  Shorts, whatever.
[01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:01.480]  The reels Instagram reels are amazing.
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:03.560]  Did you see that one?
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:07.480]  There was one recently going around the guy like that walk off shot where he just shoots
[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:12.040]  it across the they're going back and forth and it looks like the one guy's got it.
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:19.400]  And then he goes too far to one side and the other guy just like just very nonchalantly
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:20.280]  just taps it.
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:20.680]  Yes.
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:22.760]  Yes, I did.
[01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:26.840]  And I think that the winning shot didn't even have to go over the net because they've gone
[01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:30.120]  so far to the side that he could just sort of deke it over there.
[01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:36.120]  Yeah, I've seen some crazy shots with spin on the ball where the guy shoots it with so
[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:41.000]  much spin that it hits the other side of the net and then starts coming back over the net
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.040]  to the other direction.
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:46.840]  But anyway, pickleball.
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:48.200]  How did it gain traction?
[01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:56.040]  Why something something happened and it had been sitting there for decades and all of
[01:30:56.040 --> 01:31:03.160]  a sudden our generation of middle aged people looking for some kind of exercise, but not
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:04.360]  too much exercise.
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:07.960]  Yeah, I don't want to cover a whole tennis court.
[01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:08.840]  Jesus Christ.
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:10.120]  Come on this.
[01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:12.760]  But it's also it's also something you can't really get hurt.
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:14.040]  Like I played racquetball.
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:17.320]  I played racquetball for years and you get nailed by the ball frequently.
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:20.200]  Like, I mean, you can get hit by a pickleball, but it's not going to hurt them.
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:24.680]  Yeah, I took it hurt like a racquetball had racquetball and squash.
[01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:28.440]  And we had a I don't know why, but it seems odd for a college.
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:31.960]  We had a physical physical education requirement.
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:37.480]  And and rather than I maybe I did take basketball at one point, the sport I was good at because,
[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:39.720]  of course, I want to do the one I know how to play.
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:45.720]  But I took I took racquetball and squash and it does like two idiots like maybe me and
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:47.960]  you going into a racquetball court.
[01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:50.120]  We could have some fun hitting it.
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:55.880]  But like when you play someone who knows what they're doing, it's we're back to the Superman
[01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:57.720]  thing with like a bullet coming at your face.
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:03.320]  I mean, because that's what they do to like the good players.
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:07.720]  They A, they hit the ball incredibly hard and B, they purposefully try to get it to
[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:12.120]  come right at you because that it's the hardest shot to hit if it's off to your side because
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:17.000]  you'll you'll shoot it into the wall, you'll refract it somehow like it'll go the wrong
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:17.160]  way.
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:17.320]  Yeah.
[01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:18.280]  Do you ever play squash?
[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:20.280]  No, I never played squash.
[01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:21.000]  That scares me.
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.600]  Yeah, that's because that ball is hard.
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:23.960]  The ball is like a golf ball.
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:27.000]  Yeah, it's like, yeah, I wasn't getting in there.
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:32.280]  You you think you think it looks like a fun little rubber ball, like the type of ball.
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:33.720]  No, the type of like a rock.
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:33.960]  Yeah.
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:37.000]  It looks like something like a little kid would just I would just like to have that
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.120]  ball just to bounce around.
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:45.080]  No, it is like a goddamn slingshot pellet or something designed to kill you.
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:53.720]  So anyway, Pickleball doesn't have any of that, but somehow mysteriously to me has
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:59.880]  suddenly gained significant traction, at least in the US after being around it.
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:04.280]  How did Blue Sky suddenly gain traction over the last two weeks?
[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:05.480]  I don't know.
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:07.160]  I think they opened it up to more people.
[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:12.760]  I mean, I think they added they gave I'm not positive because people people were
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:16.840]  lightly wondering about codes and I could never find them.
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:18.760]  And then I finally like swiped.
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:20.200]  I was like, oh, there they are.
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:24.040]  And I had I guess I had three codes all along and I didn't know about it.
[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:30.760]  But I imagine that they gave more people codes to let more people in, I guess.
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:37.880]  I guess but but there are other services that have popped out for obvious reasons.
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:45.640]  The moment to have a Twitter alternative has come and it's a mystery like Mastodon to
[01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:53.080]  me is more like Pickleball where Mastodon had been going on for years and existed.
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:55.560]  And it was and it wasn't 35 years.
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:34:03.080]  But for five years, this thing and all of the activity pub standards that Mastodon is
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:06.920]  based on and I because I'm a nerd, I'm sure you do, too.
[01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:12.520]  I know people who left Twitter years ago, people who had more, I don't know, the common
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:13.480]  sense that me.
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:22.840]  Yeah, a lower threshold for Trump era insanity and replies and stuff like that that you
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:26.440]  just don't want to see and they left for Mastodon years ago.
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:34.840]  And it makes sense to me that Mastodon suddenly saw a surge last fall in December,
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:35.720]  January.
[01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:41.080]  And like when I started talking about it here and I've shifted almost all I don't I still
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:45.480]  check Twitter because I have readers and followers there, but I don't enjoy it, especially
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:48.840]  since I have to use their app and website instead of Tweetbot.
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:50.600]  And I spent then that was the nail.
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:51.400]  That was the final.
[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:55.160]  I mean, I was checking for a while, but once Tweetbot and Twitter effect, that was it.
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:57.160]  But I spend my time on Mastodon.
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:01.000]  It makes sense that it was there waiting to happen and it has taken off.
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:07.240]  So I don't I'm not quite sure how Blue Sky has this enthusiasm when it's such a Mastodon
[01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:10.760]  like idea, but is not itself Mastodon.
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:13.560]  But there but there is something to it.
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:16.680]  And they don't have third party apps yet, but presumably they will.
[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:22.760]  The app just seems like the Twitter app with all the nonsense taken out, right?
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:23.160]  It is.
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:29.960]  And I think that's I think it's finally getting the people who were not interested,
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:33.640]  like who either had a bad experience on Mastodon for one reason or another.
[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:37.880]  And there are people who very legitimately had bad experiences on Mastodon.
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:42.120]  I think there are a lot of people of color who were treated poorly when they moved to
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:49.160]  Mastodon and never for very legitimate reasons didn't get over that.
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:56.520]  And worse, the people on Mastodon didn't get over it because they didn't improve their
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:58.120]  behavior, a lot of them.
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:03.000]  So they were looking for something else and didn't want to be on Twitter.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.760]  And now this came up.
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:05.880]  We'll see if it's any better.
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:08.040]  I'm not convinced yet.
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:14.200]  I don't know either, but there's a subtle difference in so you get like I think I'm
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:26.200]  at Gruber dot blue dot sky, I think is my profile Gruber at Gruber dot BSKY dot social.
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:30.920]  So sort of a mouthful, but that's the default server, I guess.
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:36.280]  But you can apparently if you own a domain name, use whatever domain name you want and
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:38.200]  you don't have to run a server.
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:40.200]  Like this is where it seems a lot.
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:43.640]  This is where you start seeing the appeal where you don't have to run this whole instance.
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:45.640]  You just register a domain name.
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:55.240]  And so my friend Andy Bayo of waxy.org fame blogging his blue sky is at Andy dot Bayo
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:55.880]  dot net.
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:00.920]  So I guess if this sticks, I should look into some kind of domain.
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:02.600]  Yeah, I was thinking that as well, right?
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:05.560]  I've never had a Gruber dot domain.
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:09.080]  There's some goddamn company in Arizona that registered.
[01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:13.400]  I thought I should get Gruber dot com in like 1994 because I was like, I'm ahead of the
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:16.360]  curve and some there's some and somebody had already taken it.
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:17.640]  I bet they're still there.
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:19.560]  I haven't looked in a while, but I should.
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:21.480]  But Gruber dot something.
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:26.040]  Maybe I just find one of those weird domain extensions that's out there.
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:30.280]  Yeah, the Gruber cause this SKY was that the is that an action?
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:33.720]  I think so BSKY dot social is the default, but it doesn't matter.
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:37.640]  But you don't have to the thing that you don't have to run a server just to have your own
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:39.160]  custom name is huge.
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:45.560]  Like I do not as much as I'm enthusiastic about Mastodon for years and I like having
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:46.040]  control.
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:48.680]  I like that I run Daring Fireball on my own server.
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:51.160]  I wouldn't I wouldn't have it any other way.
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:54.760]  I don't want to run my social media presence server.
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:56.360]  I just know I just don't.
[01:37:56.360 --> 01:38:01.000]  Yeah, well, because I mean, particularly the way that Mastodon is set up, it becomes a
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.680]  moderation nightmare because now you're like if you're going to have other people.
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:08.840]  If it's just you, that's probably that's probably fine, but it's an added expense.
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:12.680]  But if you're going to have other people on your server, then now you're responsible
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:17.000]  for everything that they say, which I do not want to get into the business.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:17.960]  Nope, do not.
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:21.000]  I'm looking here as a side note at Gruber dot com.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.160]  It is in fact welcome to the Gruber companies.
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:25.880]  It's the same company I can tell by the typeface.
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:32.440]  They've got Gruber communication products, Gruber power services, Gruber technical services,
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:34.360]  and then the one that's most intriguing to me.
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:35.720]  And I guess I should look into it.
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:37.320]  I'm not making this up.
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:38.680]  The Gruber Motor Company.
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:44.120]  Oh, just so there goes my idea of being the next John DeLorean.
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:44.680]  I got it.
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:46.440]  Yeah, I'm going to have to come up with a better name.
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:52.520]  But anyway, Andy Bayo here on Blue Sky, as Andy just prone to do in looking into fascinating
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:58.280]  things like this is people are buying Blue Sky invitation codes for up to 300 bucks on
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:02.200]  eBay, immediate invitation codes, too.
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:06.840]  And I'm just giving away like $297 or best offer free shipping.
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:11.400]  Are they going to write it down and mail it to you?
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:11.880]  I guess.
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:13.480]  Well, I guess they just email it to you.
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:13.960]  You know what I mean?
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:17.080]  It's the best instant gratification, but people are doing it.
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:20.760]  You know, like that's it speaks to the moment, right?
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:26.440]  That something that at some point soon it seems like it's going to be once they are
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:29.960]  confident in their scaling, everybody will just go like Twitter.
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:33.080]  You could just go there and sign up for free without an invitation code.
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:38.600]  If you just wait and people are buying them for $300 because they and I get the urge,
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:38.840]  right?
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:43.880]  It's like you kind of want your username, but you want at Gruber or at Molt's or whatever
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:44.920]  your favorite thing is.
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:49.480]  But it's a mystery to me that Blue Sky is clearly gaining.
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:49.880]  I don't know.
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:52.040]  Is it going to last or is it going to be a flash in Japan?
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:52.440]  I don't know.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:57.800]  I mean, it started out very from not much though, because like I said, it was, there
[01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:00.040]  was not a lot of activity prior to this week.
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:04.520]  And I think I read an article on the verge saying from earlier this month, earlier in
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:07.080]  April saying they had about 20,000 people.
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:10.440]  So it wasn't really very big to begin with.
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:11.560]  And so it's definitely taken off.
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:16.600]  I mean, you got AOC is on there now and I guess drill is also on there too.
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:23.160]  So, and, and, and, uh, Darth or somebody pretending to be dark, I wasn't positive.
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:26.200]  It's a, if it's actually dark or not, it seems like it is, but you know, you never
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:26.440]  know.
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:30.200]  We've run into people who pretend to be other people previously.
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:31.240]  I should check.
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:33.800]  I'm, I'm friends with, I am friends with Darth.
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:35.160]  I could check.
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:35.400]  Yeah.
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:38.520]  Check for, I would love to know if that would make sure that's really dark.
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:43.000]  I will find out and I will make a note and I will let you know and put it in the show
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:43.320]  notes.
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:49.720]  But yes, there's a seemingly convincing Darth tweeting about dogs and et cetera.
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:54.360]  So, I mean, that's, you know, it's the kind of thing that are, but there's some going
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:41:00.120]  on here that makes me think that maybe it's, I would have said a month ago cause I knew
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:03.000]  that they were still noodling with it and blue sky was an ongoing product.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.680]  But even as recently as a month ago, I would have said, this is never going to ship.
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:09.880]  This is sort of a weird Jack Dorsey idea.
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:12.680]  And why Mastodon is clearly taking off.
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:15.560]  So that there's no oxygen left for blue sky.
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:18.040]  And I think clearly that was wrong.
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:18.760]  There is.
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:25.640]  And I think it's some, it is just, my theory is there's a subtle difference in the ease
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:30.200]  of signing up of blue sky that Mastodon doesn't have.
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:36.280]  And it's, it's a slightly more, it's, these are, it's more like Twitter and simpler where
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:40.280]  it's like, okay, you have, you can have your own domain name, but it's just a name.
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:45.800]  And then you just follow individuals and they show up and their posts show up in your timeline.
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:46.520]  And that's it.
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:47.000]  Yeah.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.600]  Whereas Mastodon doesn't have that simple explanation.
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:55.320]  There's like, well, some of these, some, the one timeline is from your instance.
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:42:01.480]  You can get posts from people on other instances, but it's, and that.
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:01.640]  Yeah.
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:02.520]  And it's janky.
[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:04.120]  There's a lot of, yeah, there's a lot of trouble.
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:09.080]  Like if you look at people who, depending on how you look at who someone is following,
[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:12.600]  you'll either only see the people that they're following on your instance, or if you look
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:14.120]  at it a different way, you can see all of them.
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:14.360]  Yeah.
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:19.000]  And I'm looking and I've been using blue sky for a couple of weeks now, and I'm looking
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  at their suggestions in my network and they are all very interesting to me, or at least
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:25.960]  I know them right.
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:27.560]  You said AOC is there now.
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:33.560]  Chrissy Teigen, who's very, very, not the sort of person I talk about a lot, but she's
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:35.400]  very, very good at social media.
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:37.880]  I mean like exceptional.
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:38.920]  So she's there.
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:41.240]  Ken White, who's Popat.
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:41.880]  Oh, Popat.
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:42.040]  Yeah.
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:42.440]  A great.
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:47.560]  Some of these people, I mean, Darth had been on Mastodon previously and seems to have tailed
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:48.280]  off a bit there.
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:51.400]  I think Popat is still active in Mastodon as well.
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:55.720]  So some of them people, some of the people are on both, but varying degrees.
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:55.880]  Yeah.
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:43:02.840]  Here's, and here is our friend Drill, AKA Wint, AKA the greatest pure tweeter of all
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:03.640]  time, right?
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:12.120]  That's the one person who mastered the art form of the tweet.
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:12.600]  Yeah.
[01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:12.840]  Yeah.
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:14.120]  But anyway, it's going on.
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:19.640]  I guess I got to look at it, but now it's just like, I don't know what it does.
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:22.920]  How much time do I have a day to dick around on Twitter?
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:24.280]  Like social media, right?
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:25.640]  Yeah, right, right.
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:27.720]  But anyway, it's happening.
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:30.360]  Invitation codes going for 300 bucks on eBay.
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:32.360]  I got one.
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:39.080]  They get, I think there's something going on here with the scarcity, right?
[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:41.640]  That drives up the interest, right?
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:48.760]  It's like, that's a factor in this sudden traction too, where all of a sudden you get
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:51.160]  the hint that it's a thing and you don't want to miss out.
[01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:53.240]  And yet it's severely limited.
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:59.480]  But they most well, and that's what I think we'll be telling in the next month or two,
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:04.280]  probably is to whether or not it keeps going the way it's going, or if it goes off once
[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:06.840]  people are like, okay, that was fun for a while.
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:09.080]  And now I'm going to go back to whatever I was doing before.
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:14.920]  Yeah, there was like with the, I'm on the Mastodon dot social instance, the big, that's
[01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:20.440]  like the first one and the main one is it's, and I don't know if they still have signups
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:24.440]  closed to the public, but you know, as of a couple months ago, when they were exploding
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:29.320]  in growth, if you went to Mastodon dot social and you didn't have an account, they would
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:34.360]  send you to like a list of Mastodon servers other places.
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:40.680]  And it was partly because they were trying to control their own scaling of their instance,
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:43.800]  which is the biggest instance with the most active users.
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:50.120]  And also philosophically, the creators of Mastodon really embraced the federated ness
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:58.600]  of it, the Federation, they really want a robust ecosystem of many instances to thrive.
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:02.600]  And so they're happy to send people to other ones to sign up.
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:09.480]  But it confuses people who aren't deeply embedded in the world of Federation because
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:11.320]  they're like, I don't know which one to pick, right?
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:15.640]  And then all of a sudden, like it's, when you go to the store and there's one kind of
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:19.000]  peanut butter and you want peanut butter, it's a lot easier than when you go and there's
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.360]  a whole aisle of peanut butter.
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:21.960]  So you're like, ah, Christ, what do I want here?
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:24.200]  Oh, the natural or whatever.
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:26.360]  It confuses people.
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:31.720]  And it's the thing it has not, I mean, they, they have not revealed a monetization for
[01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:34.920]  blue sky strategy yet, particularly.
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:38.760]  So that's another shoe that's waiting to be dropped on this whole thing.
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:38.920]  Right.
[01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:40.520]  There's a sort of, here we go again.
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:42.120]  Yeah.
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:42.620]  Yeah.
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.160]  That's how we got into this problem in the first place.
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:45.640]  Right.
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:46.140]  Exactly.
[01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:49.000]  Twitter used to be nothing but fun too.
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:55.320]  That's what I always think when I look at these timelines and it's just people I like
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:59.240]  and messages, all, all of them are posts that I wanted to see.
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:00.840]  Cause I chose to see them.
[01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:01.560]  It's like, Oh yeah.
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:03.480]  I remember when Twitter was like this.
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:03.980]  Yeah.
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:09.240]  If I had codes to give out to, to those of you listening, I would, but they told me I
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:14.840]  had one, they said I I I'd been using the service for long enough and I had one invitation
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:17.640]  code and I used it to get my wife on.
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:20.360]  And then they, they, well, well, I don't know.
[01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:22.440]  It's just, it seems like something she might want.
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:23.880]  Oh, I got an extra one now.
[01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:26.200]  Where do you had three and I used two of them.
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:27.240]  And now I got two guys.
[01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:28.120]  Now I have two again.
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:29.320]  You're a, you're a lucky man.
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:30.280]  Where do you go to see it?
[01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:30.840]  I'm not sure.
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:33.080]  That's the thing that threw me.
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:33.800]  I couldn't find it.
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:37.080]  So you go into your timeline and you swipe right.
[01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:42.920]  And you can see your there's like a sidebar.
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:45.000]  No, I don't know.
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:45.480]  I forget.
[01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:46.120]  I did find it.
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:47.640]  And sometimes it doesn't seem like it works.
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:51.720]  I spent a bunch of times swiping and couldn't get into that.
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:53.320]  And right now it's working perfectly.
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:55.160]  So I don't know why I might.
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:58.360]  I might be in a bad, but anyway, they told me that I wouldn't, I wouldn't get one for
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:46:59.640]  another two weeks anyway.
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:04.440]  So anyway, blue sky, maybe it'll be a thing.
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:08.680]  Maybe this will be a waste of 20 minutes of the podcast, but I enjoyed.
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:10.440]  All right.
[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:12.600]  Let me thank, let me thank our sponsors.
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:17.640]  Our two great companies collide where you can go to manage your fleet of devices at
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:23.240]  a collide with a K KOL IDE.com slash the talk show.
[01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:28.440]  And of course our very good friends at Squarespace at squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:35.160]  No, the John people that we've mentioned Biff, you're, you're a superhero action show podcast
[01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:37.320]  with guy English and Dan Morin, which is good.
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:38.280]  What else?
[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:43.880]  Where else can the rebound to tech podcast with Dan and Lex Friedman.
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:46.280]  And also I've started writing for six colors.
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:49.800]  I've got a weekly column going for six colors, which I've had a lot of fun with.
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:52.600]  And I've enjoyed that very, very much.
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:54.360]  What's the column called this weekend?
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:55.400]  Apple this week in Apple.
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:56.760]  Yeah, that's great.
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:47:59.240]  It's a weekly, it's a weekly wrap up, right?
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:03.880]  Covered the top three stories from very, very enjoyable.
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:04.440]  I love it.
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:09.800]  But, and it's just one more reason that I, I, I enjoy, I enjoy that six color site.
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:11.640]  I do.
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:12.440]  Yeah, it's great.
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:15.640]  Yeah, no, it's, it's, it's one of my favorites and I'm glad to be working with these guys.
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:15.960]  Yeah.
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:22.600]  Well, some of them are all right.
