[00:00.000 --> 00:03.920]  Well, I enjoyed the first, uh, new show on the new network.
[00:04.360 --> 00:05.640]  Uh, did you notice any difference?
[00:06.240 --> 00:07.440]  No, not at all.
[00:07.440 --> 00:11.360]  The RSS worked and sounded good.
[00:11.520 --> 00:16.160]  A couple of people, it was, you know, put a little extra effort into it.
[00:16.200 --> 00:22.280]  Uh, it seems like, uh, they weren't pretty well in terms of like all the stuff that
[00:22.280 --> 00:27.960]  was supposed to forward getting forwarded, you know, the, uh, the RSS feed redirects.
[00:27.960 --> 00:31.200]  And it's just crazy though, because it's like, there's like four different
[00:31.200 --> 00:37.280]  redirects there's like feeds dot mule radio dot net slash the talk show is
[00:37.280 --> 00:46.000]  really a C name, um, is that feed burner now feed, uh, press feed press is like
[00:46.000 --> 00:49.200]  the new indie, totally indie version of feed burner.
[00:49.360 --> 00:50.440]  I should probably get on that.
[00:50.440 --> 00:51.920]  I'm still using feed burner.
[00:52.280 --> 00:53.480]  I still don't know though.
[00:53.480 --> 00:58.960]  It's like, uh, I'm like, I'm torn because they do seem to have some good analytics.
[00:58.960 --> 01:03.760]  But on the other hand, I always like just controlling my feed.
[01:04.240 --> 01:04.720]  Totally.
[01:04.840 --> 01:07.600]  And they, you know, and the feed press seems like the best option
[01:07.640 --> 01:09.120]  for something like this by far.
[01:09.600 --> 01:12.760]  Um, and you know, you could, there's like a, you know, they have an API.
[01:12.760 --> 01:16.200]  So you can always do a manual rebuild, say, Hey, look, I, you know, I made an
[01:16.200 --> 01:21.480]  edit to my last entry, rebuild the feed so that you have the current version of
[01:21.480 --> 01:26.320]  everything, you know, I don't know, I might, it seems like they do a decent
[01:26.320 --> 01:29.760]  job estimating subscribers, which is the big thing, right?
[01:29.800 --> 01:30.080]  Yeah.
[01:30.080 --> 01:33.880]  And that's, and I think you're on a SoundCloud as well.
[01:33.920 --> 01:34.440]  Yeah.
[01:34.680 --> 01:35.040]  Yeah.
[01:35.040 --> 01:36.440]  That's why I signed up there.
[01:36.440 --> 01:40.680]  Cause they're the only ones who even try to tell you how many times it's been played.
[01:40.760 --> 01:41.360]  Yes.
[01:41.480 --> 01:45.640]  I don't know how they are determining, you know, what counts as a play.
[01:45.880 --> 01:49.440]  This was like the old YouTube question of 2006.
[01:49.440 --> 01:52.920]  Like, right, how much of the video do they actually watch?
[01:53.880 --> 01:57.640]  Uh, and I actually owe the listeners a correction on that.
[01:57.640 --> 01:58.880]  I was Moltz last week.
[01:58.920 --> 02:05.280]  I, uh, I said SoundCloud was free and they do have a free tier, but, uh, for
[02:05.280 --> 02:07.560]  like unlimited downloads, it's not free.
[02:07.640 --> 02:12.200]  It's $30 a month, I think, which is what I have now for, for this show.
[02:12.720 --> 02:19.360]  Um, but compared to what I would pay to host the audio on S3, uh, which I
[02:19.360 --> 02:24.840]  think would probably be around two or three grand a month, it is free, right?
[02:24.920 --> 02:28.920]  When you, when you're comparing two or three grand for hosting on S3 versus
[02:28.920 --> 02:34.240]  $30 a month for SoundCloud, all right, that's free in my, you know, with an
[02:34.240 --> 02:34.800]  asterisk.
[02:35.520 --> 02:35.800]  Yeah.
[02:35.800 --> 02:39.160]  It's crazy that S3 gets expensive.
[02:39.160 --> 02:42.840]  It doesn't really scale that well in terms of pricing for media.
[02:43.160 --> 02:44.280]  No, not yet.
[02:44.960 --> 02:45.920]  Like video.
[02:45.920 --> 02:50.800]  I mean, I can't even imagine what a popular video download would cost.
[02:50.920 --> 02:51.240]  Yeah.
[02:51.240 --> 02:55.440]  Cause I would think video would have to be at least at least an order of
[02:55.440 --> 02:59.680]  magnitude bigger than audio, right?
[03:00.080 --> 03:04.680]  Uh, all of which just makes YouTube's infrastructure more impressive when you
[03:04.680 --> 03:05.280]  think about it.
[03:05.360 --> 03:06.240]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:06.800 --> 03:07.040]  Yeah.
[03:07.040 --> 03:13.680]  Cause my show, this show is usually around 70 megabytes, you know, 60, 70, 80
[03:13.680 --> 03:18.320]  megabytes, depending on how, how far past the hour mark we blow.
[03:18.640 --> 03:19.000]  Yeah.
[03:19.040 --> 03:21.880]  Um, the one hour, you mean the two hour?
[03:21.960 --> 03:22.280]  Yeah.
[03:22.280 --> 03:25.960]  Two hours, you know, you're still, do you, I think it's usually under still
[03:25.960 --> 03:28.920]  under, I think it's like 50 megabytes for about an hour.
[03:29.080 --> 03:33.160]  And then, uh, at the, you know, with the audio compression settings we use.
[03:33.840 --> 03:37.960]  And so, you know, somewhere between 50 and a hundred for an hour plus show.
[03:37.960 --> 03:43.480]  My first big story at Forbes when I was there was trying, and this was, uh,
[03:43.520 --> 03:51.880]  early 2006 trying to guess how much YouTube span with bill was based on their,
[03:52.280 --> 03:56.880]  and this is YouTube, you know, pre Google acquisition, their venture funded
[03:56.880 --> 03:57.440]  company.
[03:58.000 --> 04:01.840]  And back then they were very few options for hosting video.
[04:01.840 --> 04:05.200]  So they were using, uh, these content delivery networks.
[04:05.200 --> 04:08.040]  And I think one, I think the one they were using was limelight.
[04:08.080 --> 04:11.680]  Um, and the big one is Akamai, which is actually, they're both public companies
[04:11.680 --> 04:16.200]  now, but, um, and they refuse to talk to me.
[04:16.200 --> 04:17.080]  They wouldn't tell me.
[04:17.160 --> 04:23.120]  Um, and so I just use kind of publicly available data of how, you know, how
[04:23.120 --> 04:28.320]  many, how many hours of video they stream today, the kind of, uh, rate, you
[04:28.320 --> 04:32.800]  know, going rate for video streaming, uh, or video, they actually don't, don't
[04:32.840 --> 04:33.760]  did not stream.
[04:33.760 --> 04:37.200]  It was a, it was a progressive download, which was cheaper than streaming
[04:37.200 --> 04:43.600]  because back then to stream, you had to have some Adobe license and, uh, and
[04:43.600 --> 04:47.960]  then, yeah, and then I, and I made a guess and I guess that it was a million
[04:47.960 --> 04:52.680]  dollars a month, um, you know, an educated guest based on interviews with
[04:52.680 --> 04:54.160]  all these experts and that kind of stuff.
[04:54.240 --> 04:58.120]  And we published this article and people went crazy.
[04:58.120 --> 05:03.280]  It was just a huge, it got a lot of attention because I think the dig was
[05:03.280 --> 05:07.160]  the dig headline was something, this was when dig was massive.
[05:07.160 --> 05:12.520]  It was like YouTube burning up cash, spending a million dollars a month on,
[05:13.040 --> 05:15.760]  uh, of their VC money on bandwidth.
[05:15.840 --> 05:23.280]  And, um, I, the first thing I heard of back, you know, kind of through like
[05:23.280 --> 05:28.520]  a second degree grapevine was that I was kind of off by 10 X, which is
[05:28.520 --> 05:32.760]  kind of, you know, not ideal, you know, it's always, it was very clear that
[05:32.760 --> 05:36.360]  it was an estimate and you never want to be off by, by that much.
[05:36.360 --> 05:40.520]  So, uh, you know, a million dollars a month would have been a lot back then,
[05:40.520 --> 05:45.400]  especially, you know, this was before the era of the $50 million VC round.
[05:45.480 --> 05:47.320]  So, so which way were you off though?
[05:47.320 --> 05:48.400]  You were off high.
[05:48.400 --> 05:49.240]  I was high.
[05:49.240 --> 05:49.560]  Yeah.
[05:49.600 --> 05:52.440]  So they were, they were running YouTube pre pre Google.
[05:52.440 --> 05:55.560]  They were running it for a hundred thousand dollars, roughly a month.
[05:55.880 --> 05:57.120]  Maybe something like that.
[05:57.120 --> 05:59.840]  But then I also, yeah, yeah.
[05:59.840 --> 06:04.320]  Well, it was much smaller then, but then I think I saw an interview more
[06:04.320 --> 06:08.520]  recently with one of the founders where they said that it cost almost a
[06:08.520 --> 06:10.400]  million dollars a month in the early days.
[06:10.400 --> 06:11.440]  So I don't know.
[06:11.440 --> 06:12.080]  I don't really know.
[06:12.920 --> 06:16.760]  I mean, you know, someone has the bill somewhere, so we know, but then if you
[06:16.760 --> 06:21.160]  looked at limelight's financials, there was no way that YouTube was, you know,
[06:21.160 --> 06:25.000]  that big of there because they were not a huge, uh, company at that point,
[06:25.000 --> 06:27.440]  there was no way that YouTube was generating like a third of their
[06:27.440 --> 06:28.640]  revenue or whatever it was.
[06:28.640 --> 06:33.480]  So anyway, it was a really, it was like one of the first, um, business tech
[06:33.480 --> 06:37.800]  stories I did where we kind of played the wire, you know, the follow the
[06:37.800 --> 06:40.200]  money game and it was a lot of fun.
[06:40.280 --> 06:41.360]  It was a really fun story.
[06:41.360 --> 06:42.440]  It got a lot of attention.
[06:42.720 --> 06:45.760]  I, you know, I hope it was more accurate than it was.
[06:45.760 --> 06:49.120]  And I actually don't even know how accurate it was, but because people
[06:49.120 --> 06:55.440]  from YouTube just would never comment or, or give a suggestion either way, but
[06:55.440 --> 06:55.840]  it was fun.
[06:56.080 --> 06:56.240]  Yeah.
[06:56.240 --> 06:59.400]  It's a fun, like a modern equivalent of how many jelly beans are
[06:59.400 --> 07:01.000]  in the jar type of question.
[07:01.360 --> 07:01.760]  Totally.
[07:01.760 --> 07:02.160]  Yeah.
[07:02.920 --> 07:06.440]  And back then, you know, now video delivery is a lot cheaper, I think.
[07:06.520 --> 07:13.040]  Um, and, and video is bigger too, cause it's HD, but, um, it's, it's, you
[07:13.040 --> 07:16.920]  know, and I'm sure there are quite a lot of companies with billion dollar
[07:17.160 --> 07:18.280]  AWS bills.
[07:18.760 --> 07:19.480]  Oh, it's gotta be.
[07:19.760 --> 07:20.080]  Yeah.
[07:20.280 --> 07:23.400]  Well, Google, I wonder what, I wonder, you know, a good question now is what
[07:23.400 --> 07:26.360]  is Google paying for bandwidth for YouTube a month?
[07:27.680 --> 07:32.360]  I wonder because I think that a lot, and this is where now I'm making
[07:32.360 --> 07:35.960]  stuff up cause I don't actually know, but I think a lot of their, uh,
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.000]  bandwidth is on a peering basis.
[07:38.000 --> 07:40.680]  So they don't have to pay actual cash.
[07:40.680 --> 07:45.520]  They just kind of plug in to the other ISP and they, I don't know.
[07:45.600 --> 07:46.320]  Great question.
[07:46.680 --> 07:47.160]  Probably.
[07:47.640 --> 07:48.440]  I'm not sure.
[07:48.680 --> 07:49.200]  It must be.
[07:49.200 --> 07:53.560]  I, and yeah, you might be right that, that Google isn't such a unique situation
[07:53.560 --> 07:56.600]  that they're, they don't pay for bandwidth like normal companies do, but
[07:56.640 --> 07:59.960]  yeah, and there were always all these murmurs that like Google was buying
[07:59.960 --> 08:03.080]  up all kinds of, um, dark fiber.
[08:03.080 --> 08:08.040]  And I would not be surprised if they have the most advanced network
[08:08.040 --> 08:11.000]  infrastructure of any, you know, company.
[08:12.320 --> 08:15.120]  That's not like a straight up telecom company.
[08:15.120 --> 08:21.400]  So I don't know now I'm just making stuff up, which is, you know,
[08:22.600 --> 08:23.720]  that's commentary, right?
[08:23.720 --> 08:25.840]  That's how, yeah, we're allowed to make stuff up.
[08:25.840 --> 08:26.800]  It's just podcast.
[08:26.880 --> 08:35.480]  Um, I wonder too, like for user submitted videos to, to YouTube, they
[08:35.480 --> 08:37.480]  still have the 10 minute limit, right?
[08:38.480 --> 08:39.080]  I don't know.
[08:39.080 --> 08:42.120]  I've never, I haven't uploaded a video to YouTube in a long time.
[08:42.120 --> 08:44.920]  I know that, you know, that first stuff that did or say where there's
[08:44.920 --> 08:48.000]  like a commercial partnership, I mean, when, when, you know, some people
[08:48.000 --> 08:52.840]  can host their whole movie on YouTube, but that's not just like guy signs
[08:52.840 --> 08:56.760]  up for YouTube account and uploads an hour video, like the 10 minute
[08:56.760 --> 09:02.160]  thing is still a real limit, but I'm not quite sure what the exceptions
[09:02.880 --> 09:07.960]  you still see videos chopped into multiple parts when they're clearly
[09:07.960 --> 09:13.000]  not partner videos, like, you know, re some rip of a, of an Apple
[09:13.000 --> 09:14.160]  keynote or something like that.
[09:14.160 --> 09:16.400]  A lot of them are still chunked up.
[09:17.400 --> 09:18.480]  Uh, I don't know though.
[09:18.560 --> 09:19.160]  Good question.
[09:19.480 --> 09:23.920]  I haven't, I haven't, you know, uploading, making web videos is one of
[09:23.920 --> 09:26.800]  those things that every like two or three weeks, I'm like, Oh man, I
[09:26.800 --> 09:28.880]  wish I was making cool videos.
[09:28.880 --> 09:32.360]  And then that's the end of that someday.
[09:32.360 --> 09:33.080]  Maybe, I don't know.
[09:33.080 --> 09:37.120]  Uh, yeah, I don't know the podcast audio thing, you know, again, we talked
[09:37.120 --> 09:41.080]  about, I talked about it last week, but it's, it's, it's weird.
[09:41.320 --> 09:42.560]  I don't know, but SoundCloud is cool.
[09:42.560 --> 09:46.520]  And you're right that they do just to circle back five minutes that they seem
[09:46.520 --> 09:50.760]  to do more work, trying to figure out how many downloads you have than anybody else.
[09:50.800 --> 09:56.360]  And it isn't just, okay, you started a download, right?
[09:56.400 --> 09:57.560]  Well, we think, right.
[09:57.560 --> 10:02.600]  You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't, you don't, you don't, you don't
[10:02.600 --> 10:07.840]  have to, but it's, it's important because a podcast is delivered many different
[10:07.840 --> 10:11.720]  ways, you know, I'm sure some people are actually listening to it via the
[10:11.720 --> 10:17.040]  actual SoundCloud player, but a lot of people, probably most people are just
[10:17.040 --> 10:23.160]  pulling the file through either iTunes or the iOS podcast app or any
[10:23.160 --> 10:24.840]  other pod catching type thing.
[10:24.840 --> 10:29.320]  So, well, and the other thing too, is it gets to be like RSS too, because,
[10:29.320 --> 10:34.360]  podcast is RSS, but it's same way with RSS feeders, that, that the, the
[10:34.360 --> 10:39.000]  numbers don't equate to people because let's say you signed up in Apple's
[10:39.000 --> 10:43.360]  podcast app and you have a subscription to the show, and now you're using
[10:43.360 --> 10:45.320]  Castro or something else that's new.
[10:45.800 --> 10:50.080]  Uh, people don't unsubscribe from the other one.
[10:50.080 --> 10:52.080]  So you, you might be copying it twice.
[10:52.080 --> 10:54.640]  You might be downloading it once in iTunes on your Mac where
[10:54.640 --> 10:55.680]  you don't even listen to it.
[10:55.680 --> 10:59.640]  And then once in Castro on your iPhone, you're just one person, you're
[10:59.640 --> 11:02.800]  only going to listen once, but you might have two or even three copies of it.
[11:03.600 --> 11:04.040]  Yeah.
[11:04.040 --> 11:09.640]  And I often listen to, you know, this show on three or four different devices
[11:09.640 --> 11:11.000]  throughout the course of the show.
[11:11.160 --> 11:11.440]  Right.
[11:11.800 --> 11:16.160]  So who knows what, well, it's, it's better for everyone.
[11:16.160 --> 11:18.080]  If all of those count as a place.
[11:18.480 --> 11:21.240]  No, but yeah, I mean, it's, I'm not complaining about it.
[11:21.240 --> 11:25.120]  I'm just only pointing out that it's a very hard thing to put a number on.
[11:25.120 --> 11:26.080]  And it always has been.
[11:26.080 --> 11:29.680]  I mean, even the Nielsen numbers for TV, they were nonsense, you know?
[11:29.760 --> 11:33.760]  Oh, I mean, have you ever been part of the Arbitron radio survey where you
[11:33.760 --> 11:36.880]  actually have like a paper book and you're supposed to fill in what
[11:36.880 --> 11:38.280]  you're listening to on the radio?
[11:38.440 --> 11:43.520]  No, I think I heard that when I was like 12, five bucks in the mail, it's
[11:43.520 --> 11:45.240]  like, oh yeah, fine for five bucks.
[11:45.240 --> 11:46.480]  I'll write down the radio.
[11:47.320 --> 11:47.720]  Right.
[11:47.800 --> 11:49.120]  Shows that I'm not listening to.
[11:49.160 --> 11:49.400]  All right.
[11:49.400 --> 11:53.080]  That is actually how radio ratings, I don't know if they're still computed
[11:53.080 --> 11:54.600]  that way, but they might be.
[11:54.600 --> 11:58.000]  I think, I think it's a little more digital now, but it's still,
[11:58.880 --> 12:02.640]  there's still, uh, I believe I was talking to someone about this somewhat
[12:02.640 --> 12:05.680]  recently, I don't remember if it was radio or TV though, but it's still
[12:05.680 --> 12:10.120]  based on, I think it's, I think we were talking about TV, Nielsen.
[12:10.120 --> 12:14.160]  I think it's still based on like, you know, Nielsen households that have
[12:14.520 --> 12:19.160]  some sort of equipment or now it's at some point in the eighties or nineties,
[12:19.160 --> 12:24.040]  they switched to equipment, but it, I know when I was a kid in like the
[12:24.040 --> 12:26.960]  seventies, I remember reading that it was like Nielsen, it was a log book
[12:27.000 --> 12:28.680]  that the family would do it.
[12:28.680 --> 12:33.320]  And that it, um, not that there was it back in those days, not that there
[12:33.320 --> 12:37.040]  was a lot of inappropriate stuff on, but that people would, because you
[12:37.040 --> 12:40.760]  had to self-report it, people would write, wouldn't write the trashy
[12:40.760 --> 12:43.880]  stuff that they watched, that they were embarrassed and they'd say, oh,
[12:43.880 --> 12:49.080]  I watched the, you know, the McNeil report on PBS when in fact Rick
[12:49.080 --> 12:52.000]  Steeves all night, that's all I was watching when in fact they were
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.080]  watching, you know, Brady Bunch reruns or something.
[12:54.080 --> 12:54.480]  Yeah.
[12:55.000 --> 12:55.720]  Let's take a break.
[12:55.760 --> 12:58.400]  I'm going to thank the first sponsor.
[12:58.480 --> 12:59.240]  This is great.
[12:59.240 --> 13:03.040]  This is a new sponsor, Karma, K A R M A.
[13:03.760 --> 13:09.600]  Uh, what's Karma, Karma, uh, at a high level, you kind of think of them,
[13:09.600 --> 13:12.440]  you know, like what Mophie juice pack, what that is, you know, the, not
[13:12.440 --> 13:16.160]  the ones that, uh, the case, but you know, the little square rectangle
[13:16.160 --> 13:17.880]  ones, and you just have battery power.
[13:17.880 --> 13:18.800]  You could use it for anything.
[13:18.800 --> 13:20.880]  You could use it for your iPhone, you could use it for your iPad,
[13:20.880 --> 13:22.160]  anything with a USB connection.
[13:22.560 --> 13:27.760]  Karma is like that, except instead of battery power, it's for wifi.
[13:29.040 --> 13:31.680]  So Karma is a little cute, very small.
[13:31.680 --> 13:32.640]  You take a look at the hardware.
[13:32.640 --> 13:35.480]  It's really, really small, easily fits in any kind of pocket, very
[13:35.480 --> 13:40.880]  thin, uh, 4g hotspot, and you turn it on, gets a 4g connection.
[13:40.920 --> 13:45.720]  It creates a little, takes the 4g and creates a little local wifi network
[13:45.720 --> 13:47.160]  and you can connect anything to it.
[13:47.160 --> 13:51.640]  You connect your iPhone to it, your Mac, you can connect your iPad, um,
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.720]  super cool to have a device like that, um, or a hotspot for your Mac,
[13:56.720 --> 14:01.000]  because Macs still don't come with any kind of 4g, you know, cellular
[14:01.000 --> 14:07.320]  networking, uh, and it's, they've got a crazy cool business model.
[14:07.360 --> 14:08.280]  No monthly fees.
[14:08.280 --> 14:11.000]  You just buy the data and you can take as long as you want to use it.
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.120]  So if you buy it a hundred megabytes or something like that, you only use
[14:14.160 --> 14:16.680]  15 this month, next month, it doesn't reset.
[14:16.680 --> 14:17.840]  You still have 85 left.
[14:17.840 --> 14:20.000]  You just use it until it's up, not a monthly fee.
[14:20.600 --> 14:23.160]  Um, data is really affordable.
[14:23.160 --> 14:28.080]  It costs as little as nine 99 per gig, 10 bucks for a gigabyte.
[14:28.080 --> 14:31.320]  Pretty good for, for cellular and it's made for sharing.
[14:31.360 --> 14:35.680]  So you create an account and you create a little hotspot and you let other
[14:35.680 --> 14:38.840]  people on, if you have friends, you can let them on your hotspot.
[14:39.080 --> 14:42.880]  And every time somebody else joins using your hotspot, you each get
[14:42.880 --> 14:44.920]  an extra hundred megabytes free.
[14:44.920 --> 14:47.520]  You get another hundred megabytes added to your account.
[14:47.520 --> 14:48.720]  You can use it whenever you want.
[14:49.360 --> 14:52.360]  They get a hundred megabytes to start with just for signing up for free.
[14:52.600 --> 14:54.680]  So if you just keep letting people use your thing, you
[14:54.680 --> 14:56.200]  might never even pay for data.
[14:56.720 --> 14:58.920]  Uh, they have an iOS app that lets you check.
[14:58.960 --> 14:59.920]  They have an Android one too.
[14:59.920 --> 15:02.560]  If you happen to have an Android device, uh, use the app.
[15:02.560 --> 15:05.400]  You can check your balance, see who's connected to your device right now.
[15:06.600 --> 15:07.160]  So what do you do?
[15:07.400 --> 15:11.200]  You buy the device, it's 99 bucks to buy the little hotspot device.
[15:11.280 --> 15:13.360]  Uh, when you sign up, you get a hundred megabytes free.
[15:13.360 --> 15:17.080]  Uh, but don't just go there and buy it, do it this way.
[15:17.120 --> 15:19.920]  Their URL is your karma.com.
[15:19.960 --> 15:28.480]  Y O U R K A R M A your karma.com slash the talk show, go to that code,
[15:28.520 --> 15:33.880]  your karma.com, the talk show, and you'll save 15% off right off the top.
[15:33.880 --> 15:35.320]  So it only be 85 bucks for you.
[15:35.880 --> 15:39.120]  Uh, like I said, it's like a little Mophie juice pack, but instead of battery
[15:39.120 --> 15:43.280]  power, it just gives wifi to all your devices, really quick and easy.
[15:43.280 --> 15:45.000]  Cool deal, great prices.
[15:45.040 --> 15:47.600]  And with the sharing thing, you might not even have to pay for it.
[15:47.680 --> 15:48.520]  So go check them out.
[15:48.640 --> 15:49.440]  Great sponsor.
[15:50.040 --> 15:52.920]  I've used one of these things and, uh, works, works a charm.
[15:53.880 --> 15:57.960]  Uh, used it, uh, last month out in San Francisco when I was out
[15:57.960 --> 15:59.120]  there for the build conference.
[16:00.160 --> 16:02.720]  If you can do it, if you're listening right now, you're going to WWDC.
[16:02.720 --> 16:04.120]  You should quick order one right now.
[16:04.120 --> 16:06.080]  See if you can get it before you, before you get out there.
[16:06.320 --> 16:07.680]  Can't believe that's a week away.
[16:08.920 --> 16:12.680]  I cannot either a week from we're recording on a Memorial day.
[16:12.680 --> 16:14.440]  This is Monday, the 26th of may.
[16:15.160 --> 16:20.840]  So literally one week from today, it'll be a keynote will be over, right?
[16:20.840 --> 16:24.800]  It'll be one, one o'clock Pacific as we speak.
[16:25.320 --> 16:31.880]  So we will, we'll be cracking open the health book app and yeah, pricking our
[16:31.880 --> 16:37.200]  fingertips and measuring our blood, doing a blood test on the, uh, no, I don't know.
[16:37.200 --> 16:42.760]  I use a, an app called Ida Ida Ida.
[16:42.840 --> 16:43.760]  I don't know how to pronounce it.
[16:43.760 --> 16:49.640]  I T a iOS app and it lets you make little checklists and you can sit, you know,
[16:50.080 --> 16:53.760]  probably dozens of apps that make checklists, but you, I have one for like
[16:53.760 --> 16:57.840]  packing for a conference and then when I'm done and then I just uncheck them all.
[16:57.840 --> 16:59.440]  And then the next conference I can do it again.
[17:00.120 --> 17:06.080]  Last year, like a dumb ass, I did not bring an old iPhone to WWDC.
[17:06.080 --> 17:09.440]  And so I had to sit there and think, well, I did, there's no way you have to be a
[17:09.480 --> 17:16.800]  crazy person to install the first beta of iOS on your daily use iPhone,
[17:17.440 --> 17:21.960]  especially when you're like away from home, away from, you know, you're on
[17:21.960 --> 17:22.480]  your phone all day.
[17:22.480 --> 17:23.600]  It's insane.
[17:23.920 --> 17:26.080]  And especially when it's iOS seven.
[17:26.480 --> 17:27.080]  Exactly.
[17:27.080 --> 17:27.760]  Well, exactly.
[17:27.760 --> 17:29.320]  When it's a major release like that.
[17:29.320 --> 17:33.200]  And so I never others, I don't know why, but it's, so I've added a checklist to my
[17:33.200 --> 17:36.560]  car and you know, all year long, every time I go to anywhere else, any kind of
[17:36.560 --> 17:41.520]  business trip, I get the spare iPhone for iOS beta check thing and I just check it
[17:41.520 --> 17:42.840]  off because I know I don't want it.
[17:42.840 --> 17:48.240]  But then when I pack for next week, I'll bring my iPhone five, I guess.
[17:48.720 --> 17:52.200]  I ran out and bought a iPod touch for that.
[17:53.360 --> 17:57.760]  And then there were so many people last year who went to the one that I guess
[17:57.760 --> 18:00.800]  it's closed now, the Apple store on Market Street in San Francisco.
[18:00.800 --> 18:01.280]  Yeah.
[18:01.280 --> 18:03.240]  I think they're remaking it right, right.
[18:03.240 --> 18:06.560]  They're moving up to where Levi's used to be up in Union Square.
[18:06.560 --> 18:09.480]  I'm not sure if they're done with that yet that I don't, I have no idea.
[18:09.480 --> 18:12.400]  But anyway, the one that's right up there on Market Street, a couple blocks from
[18:12.400 --> 18:16.720]  Moscone, I don't know if they sold out or they came close to, but there was like a,
[18:18.120 --> 18:25.240]  just, you know, 40, 50, 60 people from WWDC going in to buy the, the super
[18:25.240 --> 18:28.240]  cheapo 199 iPod touch.
[18:28.320 --> 18:29.040]  That's awesome.
[18:29.040 --> 18:31.240]  Like the one that doesn't even have, it doesn't even have a camera.
[18:31.440 --> 18:31.800]  Yep.
[18:31.800 --> 18:37.560]  That's when I got, took it back like a week later when I realized that there was
[18:37.560 --> 18:43.240]  no need to have an iPod touch, but, but you took it back from running the iOS beta.
[18:43.640 --> 18:44.440]  Well, I wiped it.
[18:44.440 --> 18:46.080]  I don't know what it, I don't know what it wipes to.
[18:46.080 --> 18:48.720]  It wipes back to iOS beta.
[18:48.960 --> 18:52.560]  Oh, well, I'm sure they, yeah, I wonder what they do with that.
[18:52.560 --> 18:53.360]  They can figure it out.
[18:53.440 --> 18:53.760]  Huh?
[18:54.160 --> 18:55.240]  I'm sure Apple can figure it out.
[18:55.560 --> 18:55.840]  Yeah.
[18:55.840 --> 19:01.280]  Um, yeah, I, I, I can't help but think we're going to see, we're going to get
[19:01.280 --> 19:02.720]  betas of all that stuff next week.
[19:03.880 --> 19:04.120]  Yeah.
[19:04.120 --> 19:09.480]  So I'm wondering the big question I have, um, and I'm thinking about writing about
[19:09.480 --> 19:15.320]  this tonight or tomorrow is how drastically different the new OS 10 is
[19:15.320 --> 19:21.520]  going to seem like, just thinking about how, um, you know, when iOS seven came
[19:21.520 --> 19:26.680]  out, people freaked out, you know, and obviously not the, the Mac nerd types,
[19:26.680 --> 19:33.480]  but a lot of other people did, uh, and I wonder if changing someone's Mac that
[19:33.480 --> 19:36.240]  drastically would also cause people to freak out.
[19:37.120 --> 19:40.240]  And so I wonder how different it'll be.
[19:41.440 --> 19:48.120]  Theoretically, they would change a lot of the, uh, Mac OS stuff to more closely
[19:48.120 --> 19:53.160]  resemble iOS seven or whatever iOS eight is going to look and feel like, but I
[19:53.160 --> 19:53.680]  don't know.
[19:55.200 --> 20:02.360]  Yeah, I, I, I do not know what to expect and I, my, my spidey senses is failing me.
[20:02.560 --> 20:06.200]  I mean, clearly it's going to change to some degree cosmetically, but just
[20:06.200 --> 20:07.200]  how radically, I don't know.
[20:09.320 --> 20:09.680]  Yeah.
[20:10.240 --> 20:16.360]  And also the idea of running this now almost a four year old Mac book, which
[20:16.360 --> 20:22.960]  is a four year old Mac book air with a new software, running it also seems
[20:22.960 --> 20:29.040]  strange because OS 10 has really not changed that much visually since then.
[20:29.800 --> 20:33.840]  They've added a lot of stuff that I don't use, like the launcher and all that kind
[20:33.840 --> 20:38.800]  of stuff, but I don't remember like a different feeling Mac OS.
[20:38.840 --> 20:39.160]  Right.
[20:39.600 --> 20:39.920]  Yeah.
[20:39.920 --> 20:45.760]  I think that when they, I forget which version number it was.
[20:45.760 --> 20:50.720]  10.6, maybe it was 10, five, but one of them when they, when they got rid of the
[20:50.720 --> 20:55.440]  separate metal windows and just said all the windows just have one appearance and
[20:55.440 --> 20:59.080]  it's this gray, you know what I mean?
[20:59.080 --> 21:00.920]  There's not going to be two types of windows anymore.
[21:00.920 --> 21:02.600]  We're going to simple leopard, right?
[21:02.840 --> 21:06.640]  Yeah, it was probably 10, five and then 10, six was snow leopard.
[21:06.800 --> 21:07.200]  Yeah.
[21:07.200 --> 21:11.800]  So 10, five was the one where they made it look and, and it, it certainly looked
[21:11.800 --> 21:14.800]  different than what came before it because I got rid of a lot of the candy
[21:14.800 --> 21:15.640]  colored stuff.
[21:16.240 --> 21:20.400]  Um, but it was like a gentle flattening.
[21:20.680 --> 21:23.040]  It wasn't a radical flattening, right?
[21:23.040 --> 21:27.040]  Was this is the sort of, and I think that's what a lot of people were expecting
[21:27.040 --> 21:32.840]  with iOS seven was that kind of flattening and a perfect example of that.
[21:32.840 --> 21:36.880]  If you can, anybody wants to look it up, just look up the screenshots
[21:36.880 --> 21:40.240]  from last year's WWDC app.
[21:40.680 --> 21:42.000]  Uh, yes, I remember this.
[21:42.000 --> 21:47.120]  Um, and everyone was like, Oh, this is what iOS seven is going to look like.
[21:47.160 --> 21:47.440]  Yeah.
[21:47.440 --> 21:51.480]  And I even saw on Twitter, Mark Gurman from nine to five Mac the other day was
[21:51.480 --> 21:54.840]  writing, cause he had written about it, you know, that, that, Hey, this is what
[21:54.840 --> 21:56.160]  iOS seven is going to look like.
[21:56.160 --> 22:00.560]  And he still thinks it did, that it was a clue as to what I was seven look like.
[22:00.560 --> 22:05.920]  And I would say no, it was a step in that direction, but like a half step as
[22:05.920 --> 22:09.440]  opposed to the actual Iowa seven, which was like, Holy shit.
[22:09.480 --> 22:09.720]  Yeah.
[22:09.760 --> 22:10.320]  Holy shit.
[22:10.320 --> 22:14.720]  That was my, you know, and a lot of people's reaction when that video came
[22:14.720 --> 22:20.440]  out, just showing all the, all the new graphics and all that kind of stuff.
[22:20.480 --> 22:20.720]  Right.
[22:20.960 --> 22:23.640]  And I've said this before the last, over the last couple of weeks on this show,
[22:23.640 --> 22:31.400]  like the flat is overused and talking about these interfaces, but, and you
[22:31.400 --> 22:35.040]  know, it, there's no other words that say it, that there, and a lot of the ways in
[22:35.040 --> 22:39.640]  iOS seven on the iPhone and iPad, it is flatter.
[22:39.640 --> 22:45.400]  It is a lot less three D treatments between elements, you know, that when
[22:45.400 --> 22:49.080]  something scrolls underneath a navigation bar, there's no shadow there.
[22:49.080 --> 22:51.040]  It's just a, just a one pixel line.
[22:51.520 --> 22:56.080]  I just don't see how the Mac can get away with that much flatness when you have by
[22:56.080 --> 22:58.480]  definition, these overlapping windows.
[22:59.400 --> 22:59.920]  Yes.
[23:00.360 --> 23:00.640]  Yeah.
[23:00.680 --> 23:05.280]  By the way, I love this is like, you know, as someone who learned web design in the
[23:05.280 --> 23:11.840]  mid nineties and net didn't really learn much since then, no three D or gradient
[23:11.840 --> 23:13.120]  modeling or any of that kind of stuff.
[23:13.240 --> 23:15.600]  I love flat design cause it's all I've ever known.
[23:16.080 --> 23:22.000]  So I'm, I'm actually a competent designer again, but, uh, and I'm regret, you know,
[23:22.040 --> 23:26.360]  I'm already nervous about when it's going to start getting more, more technical again.
[23:26.400 --> 23:31.200]  And yeah, yeah, we still have an iPad original iPad running.
[23:31.200 --> 23:36.600]  Uh, well, I guess it's iOS five now and, you know, I use it every few weeks and
[23:36.600 --> 23:37.760]  it's super weird.
[23:37.920 --> 23:43.560]  Yeah, I think in many ways, great, but in also many ways, I'm very used to iOS seven
[23:43.560 --> 23:44.960]  now and, and I really like it.
[23:44.960 --> 23:49.280]  Like there's, there are some annoyances, but that's probably never not going to be
[23:49.280 --> 23:51.720]  the case, but I really liked the way it feels.
[23:51.960 --> 23:52.320]  Yeah.
[23:52.320 --> 23:57.720]  I think that it's for all the, the, I'm going to botch this, the what's the German
[23:57.720 --> 24:01.440]  term Sturm and Drong, all the, yes, something like that.
[24:01.480 --> 24:03.640]  Uh, well, you guys know what I'm talking about.
[24:03.680 --> 24:09.120]  Well, for all of the consternation that iOS seven caused and, and as, as vocal as
[24:09.120 --> 24:13.400]  some of its critics are about the plainness of its visual style in hindsight,
[24:13.400 --> 24:17.160]  when I go back and fire up one of those devices, I, you know, from my stack of old
[24:17.160 --> 24:24.320]  iPhones and look at iOS six, uh, or look at an old, uh, original iPad that has to
[24:24.320 --> 24:29.080]  be running iOS five or whatever the last version that, that it supports is it looks
[24:29.080 --> 24:34.040]  so much older, it just looks way more than what I can't, it's hard to believe
[24:34.040 --> 24:38.160]  that, that, that until like eight months ago, that was what everybody was using.
[24:40.520 --> 24:45.560]  It really feels like it's, it's just the distant past visual style wise.
[24:46.080 --> 24:46.400]  Yeah.
[24:46.800 --> 24:49.040]  And I don't see that changing.
[24:49.080 --> 24:51.720]  I mean, they might perhaps make some tweaks.
[24:51.720 --> 24:57.560]  Like there are some of the iOS seven icons that just don't really make sense.
[24:58.440 --> 25:05.720]  Um, like I think game center and then maybe also the newsstand one, which is
[25:06.200 --> 25:07.840]  hiding all the apps in there.
[25:07.880 --> 25:09.320]  I don't know what's going to happen with newsstand.
[25:09.320 --> 25:13.080]  I might just vaporize, but yeah, maybe with newsstand, it's actually
[25:13.080 --> 25:15.880]  appropriate because I feel like they don't know what to do with newsstand.
[25:15.880 --> 25:19.200]  And so an icon that sort of doesn't really know what it is either.
[25:19.200 --> 25:20.280]  It kind of, it, yeah.
[25:20.280 --> 25:22.560]  Not to, not to be a jerk, but it kind of fits.
[25:22.560 --> 25:23.440]  Whereas game center.
[25:23.440 --> 25:23.800]  Yeah.
[25:23.800 --> 25:24.520]  I don't know.
[25:25.080 --> 25:26.560]  I kind of feel like they punted on it.
[25:26.560 --> 25:30.120]  It's attractive to me, but it doesn't say game center.
[25:30.600 --> 25:33.160]  No, it says balls.
[25:33.240 --> 25:33.680]  Yeah.
[25:33.680 --> 25:36.800]  It just says like, I dunno, it just looks like something, you know, we
[25:36.800 --> 25:39.320]  don't have an icon yet, but we want to start giving beta built up.
[25:39.320 --> 25:42.000]  So, you know, it could be any app, it could be any app at all.
[25:42.000 --> 25:46.200]  It could be, you know, a photo app, a notes app could be a game, you know,
[25:46.240 --> 25:48.120]  we'll just put this placeholder icon here.
[25:48.120 --> 25:49.400]  I'm excited about it though.
[25:49.400 --> 25:52.720]  I do think, you know, in the big part, I think it's really cool.
[25:52.720 --> 25:54.720]  Here we are one week out from WWDC.
[25:54.720 --> 25:57.600]  We have no idea what this Mac OS 10 thing is going to look like.
[25:58.320 --> 26:04.400]  And as a long time Mac guy, you know, as someone who really got drawn into the
[26:04.400 --> 26:09.360]  whole following Apple closely, specifically, and only because of the Mac,
[26:10.040 --> 26:13.440]  I think it's pretty awesome that here we are in 2014 and the most exciting
[26:13.440 --> 26:17.960]  thing we have coming up is the Apple
[26:17.960 --> 26:21.680]  coming up next week is a Mac interface overhaul.
[26:22.240 --> 26:22.720]  Oh yeah.
[26:23.240 --> 26:23.880]  Yeah, I'm pumped.
[26:23.920 --> 26:30.240]  I remember when I switched from six to seven on the Mac and that was crazy.
[26:30.240 --> 26:33.800]  Like that was, cause that was the first one where the folders were colored in.
[26:33.920 --> 26:34.400]  Yeah.
[26:34.560 --> 26:40.600]  Six was system six was, you know, traced outlines.
[26:40.640 --> 26:45.480]  And then seven had the beginning of that kind of 3d folder look.
[26:45.480 --> 26:49.040]  And that was just, yeah, six supported color on certain models.
[26:49.040 --> 26:50.680]  But it was, you know, what's funny.
[26:50.680 --> 26:55.920]  It was a very flat color because remember like the, when they, yeah,
[26:55.920 --> 26:57.040]  it was very, very flat.
[26:57.040 --> 27:00.200]  I think it still had a black and white Apple logo though.
[27:00.200 --> 27:03.480]  I think the color Apple logo didn't come in, you know, for the
[27:03.480 --> 27:05.280]  menu bar until system seven.
[27:05.800 --> 27:07.400]  But, uh, but everything was flat.
[27:07.400 --> 27:10.520]  You know, the wind, even though you had color, the windows were still drawn.
[27:10.560 --> 27:12.680]  Just blue, not gray scale, black and white.
[27:12.680 --> 27:16.840]  It was just black pickles, pixels, and white pixels for the windows and,
[27:16.840 --> 27:19.680]  and, uh, open and save dialogues and everything.
[27:20.000 --> 27:25.560]  And then seven had like the, the scroll bar had a gradient to it, I believe.
[27:25.560 --> 27:25.800]  Yeah.
[27:25.800 --> 27:30.360]  And the windows, the window title bar had a gradient sort of thing.
[27:30.640 --> 27:35.040]  And it was, you know, it was clearly an evolution of the system six look.
[27:35.080 --> 27:38.280]  They just kind of colored in certain parts, but they didn't color in much.
[27:38.280 --> 27:42.320]  I think it was sort of, I wouldn't call that an exciting overhaul though.
[27:42.520 --> 27:46.280]  To me going from six to seven, it was a huge change, but the interface
[27:46.280 --> 27:48.240]  wasn't really that hugely changed.
[27:48.320 --> 27:52.200]  I also think that it, it slowed down our old Mac so much.
[27:52.200 --> 27:52.560]  Yeah.
[27:52.560 --> 27:53.760]  That was the back.
[27:53.800 --> 27:57.880]  That was the thing I remember is that system seven really
[27:57.880 --> 27:59.400]  slowed down your computer.
[27:59.720 --> 28:00.040]  Yeah.
[28:00.040 --> 28:00.920]  I don't remember.
[28:00.920 --> 28:06.760]  I think that was, I think we had an LC running six or maybe a plus or something.
[28:06.760 --> 28:07.320]  I don't know.
[28:07.560 --> 28:07.760]  Yeah.
[28:07.760 --> 28:16.400]  Cause people used to, um, people used to complain about the old original open and
[28:16.400 --> 28:21.560]  save dialogue boxes a lot because they were modal and they were kind of ugly.
[28:22.200 --> 28:25.520]  Um, and it was system seven actually originally didn't fix that.
[28:25.520 --> 28:30.120]  I forget when the nav services open and save dialogue boxes came about, which
[28:30.120 --> 28:34.320]  were a little bit more modernized UI wise, but the thing about the old open
[28:34.320 --> 28:38.720]  and save dialogue boxes was that if you knew the keyboard commands, the command
[28:38.800 --> 28:43.720]  up arrow and down arrow, and you knew that you could type ahead to match items
[28:43.720 --> 28:45.040]  in a list, right?
[28:45.040 --> 28:46.120]  Like to match.
[28:46.840 --> 28:51.600]  If it's a list of people's last names, I could just type FR and get fromer.
[28:52.200 --> 28:55.760]  You could really fly through those dialogue boxes because when you'd hit
[28:55.760 --> 28:59.640]  command up to go up a level in the hierarchy and down, down, down, command,
[28:59.640 --> 29:02.760]  down, command down, um, it would update instantly.
[29:02.760 --> 29:06.240]  It was like you could, if you knew the incantation and knew your way around
[29:06.240 --> 29:08.560]  that, and you weren't using the mouse, you were using the keyboard, you could
[29:08.560 --> 29:13.680]  kind of zip around your hard disc at the similar pace as to somebody who was an
[29:13.680 --> 29:15.960]  expert on like a command line system.
[29:16.720 --> 29:20.480]  And then when, um, system seven came out, just seemed like everything got slowed
[29:20.480 --> 29:24.320]  down and you'd hit command up and you'd, you'd get the watch cursor for a little
[29:24.320 --> 29:27.720]  bit, just little, all sorts of little things really slowed down.
[29:28.160 --> 29:31.560]  And that was the thing that I hated about visiting friends' houses with
[29:31.560 --> 29:37.080]  PCs was that even though windows was, was pretty awful, it felt so fast versus
[29:37.560 --> 29:38.560]  system seven.
[29:38.600 --> 29:43.400]  And I wonder if maybe that's the kind of thing that the new Mac OS by will, will
[29:43.400 --> 29:47.280]  it be a 10 or is it, are we at a, we're not at 11, you know, it'll be 10.10.
[29:47.840 --> 29:53.120]  Um, I wonder if that's the kind of thing that a flatter, simpler UI could
[29:53.120 --> 29:56.360]  actually achieve like, Hey, PS, we made your computer faster.
[29:57.080 --> 29:58.120]  Uh, I don't know.
[29:58.160 --> 29:58.800]  Maybe not.
[29:58.840 --> 29:59.480]  Yeah, I don't know.
[29:59.480 --> 30:02.560]  I think, I feel like we've gotten to the point where even the cheapest Mac can
[30:02.560 --> 30:05.000]  render pretty quickly.
[30:05.000 --> 30:05.560]  Yeah.
[30:05.600 --> 30:09.520]  And especially if they're going to go in a less exuberant style, like there's
[30:09.520 --> 30:13.680]  certain things in the transparency and iOS that maybe they're pushing the limits
[30:13.680 --> 30:17.960]  on, not even maybe they kind of are pushing the limits on some of the iOS
[30:17.960 --> 30:22.920]  devices that support it, uh, and the parallax and stuff like that, like that
[30:22.920 --> 30:27.560]  they didn't have good frame rate on some of those effects and it's gotten better
[30:27.560 --> 30:29.600]  with seven one, but they were pushing it.
[30:29.600 --> 30:34.840]  But any Mac, you know, even the cheapest Mac mini, which hasn't even been updated
[30:34.840 --> 30:40.040]  in 600 days or something like that, uh, can just chew that stuff up.
[30:40.080 --> 30:43.640]  I mean that the days when a Mac can't render, you know, windows dropping down
[30:43.640 --> 30:48.680]  and stuff like that, our menus dropping down quickly, it's yeah, we're past that.
[30:49.520 --> 30:52.280]  Yeah, I think so too as well with SSDs and all that.
[30:53.280 --> 30:53.760]  Yeah.
[30:53.760 --> 30:55.400]  And that's a big, that's definitely a big change.
[30:55.400 --> 31:00.040]  I think it's kind of cool though that we, you know, hopefully that's the reason
[31:00.200 --> 31:04.480]  that it's kind of cool that, that we haven't seen any major leaks yet about
[31:04.880 --> 31:06.200]  what's going on.
[31:06.800 --> 31:10.000]  Uh, it could just mean that there's nothing, there's nothing worth knowing.
[31:10.040 --> 31:14.240]  I don't know if that's true, but, um, I think it's kind of cool.
[31:14.800 --> 31:15.080]  Yeah.
[31:15.080 --> 31:20.200]  And it'd be curious, the leaks often come closer to the event, right?
[31:20.240 --> 31:20.440]  Yeah.
[31:20.440 --> 31:23.640]  Especially when they're software leak, the hardware leaks kind of, uh,
[31:23.640 --> 31:28.440]  you know, have been coming too early because of the supply chain stuff.
[31:28.480 --> 31:34.560]  But when it's stuff that never left Cupertino to begin with, that typically
[31:34.560 --> 31:39.440]  is like the night before, like wasn't last year, didn't, uh, someone nine to
[31:39.440 --> 31:44.120]  five or someone else have all the icons either the night before or the morning
[31:44.120 --> 31:49.640]  of, yeah, but I think that they had it as recreations some, right?
[31:49.680 --> 31:50.000]  Yeah.
[31:50.000 --> 31:53.520]  Someone had like, yeah, they had, they had, they had, they had, they had
[31:53.520 --> 31:57.360]  like dictated to them and then they drew them and they did really good.
[31:57.440 --> 31:57.960]  Yeah.
[31:58.040 --> 31:59.640]  I think I've even joked about it with Mark government.
[31:59.640 --> 32:03.320]  It was like a, like a, like a police sketch where the, yeah.
[32:03.840 --> 32:06.960]  And it's like a dead ringer. It's like, Holy hell, that's the guy.
[32:07.000 --> 32:07.280]  Yeah.
[32:07.280 --> 32:11.880]  You know, they like, they like police sketched the icons and they did a really
[32:11.880 --> 32:16.280]  good job and it was, um, and they nailed it. And there was so many people,
[32:16.280 --> 32:20.320]  of course, because the icons are probably, it's either the first thing you see
[32:20.320 --> 32:25.400]  and be, they are, we're kind of radically simplified.
[32:26.080 --> 32:30.080]  And there were so many people who are like, no way is Apple going to do icons
[32:30.080 --> 32:30.920]  that look like that.
[32:31.920 --> 32:32.640]  That was awesome.
[32:32.880 --> 32:33.040]  Yeah.
[32:33.040 --> 32:37.760]  And then you got to wonder, you know, for the apps that have a, the same app
[32:37.760 --> 32:43.160]  and Oh, S 10 and iOS, do they have the same icons now?
[32:43.640 --> 32:49.240]  Like the safari get this, this new icon, the same as iOS, or is it still
[32:49.240 --> 32:50.920]  Mac has their own icon set?
[32:51.240 --> 32:51.600]  Right.
[32:51.600 --> 32:57.320]  And are they going to do a thing like give Mac icons and official shape like a
[32:57.320 --> 32:58.480]  circle, you know?
[32:58.520 --> 32:59.200]  Interesting.
[32:59.280 --> 33:02.680]  You know, they've done a lot of circles, you know, like the I books is new and
[33:02.680 --> 33:03.960]  has a circle and apps.
[33:03.960 --> 33:04.120]  Yeah.
[33:04.120 --> 33:05.040]  It's been a circle.
[33:05.600 --> 33:12.600]  Um, though the I work numbers and that kind of stuff are still free, free form
[33:12.600 --> 33:14.480]  shapes, arbitrary shapes.
[33:14.520 --> 33:15.040]  I don't know.
[33:15.120 --> 33:15.440]  Yeah.
[33:15.960 --> 33:16.320]  I don't know.
[33:16.320 --> 33:19.960]  I feel like, um, well, I don't know.
[33:19.960 --> 33:24.600]  I wouldn't be surprised, but I, I feel like there's so much, I mean, there's
[33:24.600 --> 33:30.400]  what has, it's gotta be 30 years of history of, of Mac icons taking whatever
[33:30.400 --> 33:31.040]  shape they want.
[33:31.560 --> 33:35.680]  Whereas iOS always had, you know, you're going to make it a little round
[33:35.680 --> 33:36.560]  cornered square.
[33:37.000 --> 33:37.440]  Right.
[33:37.840 --> 33:38.480]  That's true.
[33:39.280 --> 33:39.840]  Yeah.
[33:39.880 --> 33:41.680]  I used to make Mac icons.
[33:41.680 --> 33:43.920]  That was, uh, that was a weird hobby.
[33:43.920 --> 33:49.320]  And like high school, I think with rez edit, just kind of goofing around.
[33:50.080 --> 33:55.520]  Cause there was a, I forgot which, maybe it was eight or eight, five had kind of
[33:55.520 --> 34:01.520]  these 3d folders and I would, uh, draw the icons of apps back then.
[34:01.520 --> 34:03.800]  You know, I wouldn't keep my apps in the apps folder.
[34:03.800 --> 34:08.720]  I would just keep them in their own folders in Macintosh HD.
[34:08.720 --> 34:10.720]  So there was like the cork express folder.
[34:10.720 --> 34:14.400]  And so I made like a special cork icon for that folder.
[34:14.920 --> 34:16.640]  Actually, I think cork had a good icon.
[34:16.640 --> 34:18.040]  Some of them had awful icons.
[34:18.080 --> 34:18.240]  Yeah.
[34:18.240 --> 34:19.800]  I remember customizing icons though.
[34:19.880 --> 34:20.440]  Same thing.
[34:20.920 --> 34:21.240]  All right.
[34:21.280 --> 34:25.680]  You'd either go in, you'd either go in and actually be an idiot and go in and
[34:25.720 --> 34:30.160]  edit the actual resource in the application, or you would make your own
[34:30.160 --> 34:34.520]  icon and then copy and paste it in the finders, get info, and then you could
[34:34.520 --> 34:37.040]  just delete it and it would go back to the regular icon for the app.
[34:37.440 --> 34:37.920]  Right.
[34:37.920 --> 34:41.280]  And then some of them, I even made aliases and I think an alias could
[34:41.280 --> 34:42.840]  even maybe have its own icon.
[34:42.880 --> 34:44.440]  Yeah, I think it could.
[34:44.760 --> 34:44.960]  Yeah.
[34:44.960 --> 34:47.800]  You could, I think I'm almost sure you could, which was crazy.
[34:47.840 --> 34:49.680]  It's confusing.
[34:50.080 --> 34:50.600]  Right.
[34:50.640 --> 34:53.520]  Well, yeah, no one, anyone who would sit down on my computer wouldn't
[34:53.520 --> 34:57.520]  have no idea how to use it, but did, uh, did you ever, do you remember when,
[34:57.560 --> 35:03.040]  I don't remember which Mac OS, maybe it was eight, eight, five or eight, which
[35:03.040 --> 35:09.400]  had it shipped with maybe one or two themes, and then there was the idea
[35:09.400 --> 35:12.320]  that there would be more themes coming within, they just never came.
[35:12.800 --> 35:19.560]  Yeah, that was, I think it was, I think it was system or Mac OS eight.
[35:20.040 --> 35:23.080]  I didn't expect when they stopped calling it system eight and it was
[35:23.080 --> 35:24.680]  the first version of Mac OS eight.
[35:24.920 --> 35:30.520]  And Syracuse is listening to this show right now and his head is exploding
[35:30.520 --> 35:34.760]  because he can't just jump in and correct us and tell us exactly what.
[35:35.120 --> 35:40.520]  I think it was 8.0 and it was called the appearance manager.
[35:40.840 --> 35:41.200]  Yes.
[35:41.240 --> 35:45.480]  And the appearance manager was a control panel and it had a list of themes and
[35:45.480 --> 35:51.880]  there was platinum, which was the default look, uh, gizmo, which was the one that
[35:51.880 --> 35:57.560]  was like a kid's theme, looked like something from like Nickelodeon and, uh,
[35:57.560 --> 36:02.960]  I think it was called techno, which was sort of the, uh, I don't know, looked
[36:02.960 --> 36:07.680]  like something from, uh, uh, that would have been art directed for like, uh,
[36:08.000 --> 36:11.520]  like a terminator movie or something like that, like a sci-fi movie where
[36:11.520 --> 36:14.880]  they have, you know, a custom theme for the GUI that the compute, you
[36:14.880 --> 36:16.400]  know, that the characters are using.
[36:16.960 --> 36:24.600]  Now, did you know about the, uh, leaked unofficial fourth theme though?
[36:24.680 --> 36:25.240]  No, I don't know.
[36:25.240 --> 36:27.680]  No, I don't know the drawing board.
[36:28.000 --> 36:28.920]  Oh, of course.
[36:28.920 --> 36:29.440]  Yes.
[36:29.480 --> 36:30.280]  That was awesome.
[36:30.360 --> 36:30.720]  Yeah.
[36:31.000 --> 36:31.680]  I love that.
[36:31.840 --> 36:33.280]  I wish I could run that now.
[36:33.360 --> 36:38.000]  That'd be, if I could, if OS 10.10 was drawing board, I would take that right.
[36:38.000 --> 36:42.400]  Drawing board made it look like an architectural sketch, like the windows
[36:42.400 --> 36:47.000]  were made out of paper and that the buttons and everything were sketched in
[36:47.240 --> 36:51.480]  by an architect and it even shipped with an architect handwriting font.
[36:51.520 --> 36:54.800]  I forget the name of the font, but I don't remember it set the system font
[36:54.800 --> 36:55.200]  to that.
[36:55.240 --> 36:59.160]  So like your menus and your window titles were in that, that architect
[36:59.320 --> 37:00.320]  handwriting font.
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.720]  Uh, but I, that never shipped to customers.
[37:03.720 --> 37:05.760]  It shipped as like developer betas.
[37:06.160 --> 37:09.280]  So like, you know, people who were in the developer program got those
[37:09.280 --> 37:13.440]  themes so that you could make sure your app looked good and gizmo and techno.
[37:13.440 --> 37:16.600]  And you're right that the architectural one was the one that actually was
[37:16.600 --> 37:18.560]  like, maybe, maybe I would use that.
[37:18.680 --> 37:22.440]  I mean, it was totally, it, it, it felt like playing one of those old
[37:22.440 --> 37:27.840]  SimCity games where it was like back in the, or maybe one of those SIM games
[37:27.840 --> 37:32.160]  where it was like the expansion set and, you know, just was never as fun as
[37:32.160 --> 37:34.720]  the main SimCity, but it was cool.
[37:34.720 --> 37:36.600]  I think I ran it for a couple of months.
[37:36.640 --> 37:38.320]  I'm not, I'm not looking this up.
[37:38.320 --> 37:39.280]  I'm going from memory here.
[37:39.280 --> 37:42.680]  I'm trusting my memory, which is dangerous, but my under my recollection
[37:42.680 --> 37:48.760]  though, is that this Mac OS 8 didn't come out until after the next acquisition
[37:48.760 --> 37:52.920]  and the next had come in and Steve Jobs was the interim CEO and Avi
[37:52.920 --> 37:56.520]  Tavanian was the CTO or whatever his title was.
[37:56.680 --> 38:03.320]  And while most of their efforts were focused on getting this next step, Mac
[38:03.320 --> 38:10.720]  OS carbon next generation OS that they kind of had to start in 96 and build
[38:10.720 --> 38:13.560]  it, and they were hoping to ship it in a year and they wound up not even
[38:13.560 --> 38:17.120]  shipping it in 2000 till 2001 or whenever, you know, they were four or
[38:17.120 --> 38:19.920]  five years out from it, but in the meantime, they had to keep the company
[38:19.920 --> 38:24.960]  running and so that, that team took over, or at least overseeing the last
[38:24.960 --> 38:31.240]  few years of Mac OS evolutions, Mac OS 8, 8.1, 8.5, and 9, I guess was the
[38:31.240 --> 38:35.000]  last one, and, you know, direct 6-2, right.
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.240]  And they were like ready to ship it with these themes and Steve
[38:37.240 --> 38:38.960]  Jobs was like, what is this bullshit?
[38:38.960 --> 38:40.280]  Get it out, get it all out.
[38:40.640 --> 38:41.760]  It ships with platinum.
[38:41.800 --> 38:42.920]  That's what it looks like.
[38:42.920 --> 38:48.120]  And so it shipped with an appearance manager and it would say theme.
[38:48.160 --> 38:51.920]  And there was one choice it like, so they, they ripped the themes out.
[38:51.960 --> 38:54.560]  The alternate themes were ripped out at the last minute, but they didn't
[38:54.560 --> 38:56.040]  couldn't rewrite all the software.
[38:56.360 --> 39:00.120]  So it was this interface that looked like it was meant to have a list of themes.
[39:00.120 --> 39:02.400]  And it did, but there was only one to choose from.
[39:02.480 --> 39:02.960]  Yeah.
[39:03.880 --> 39:05.040]  It was, it was hilarious.
[39:05.040 --> 39:09.680]  And I was that when you could, when you could change the colors to match the
[39:09.680 --> 39:14.840]  different iMac colors as well, like tangerine and, and lime and that kind of
[39:14.840 --> 39:15.960]  stuff, or was that later?
[39:15.960 --> 39:16.480]  I don't remember.
[39:16.480 --> 39:19.680]  I think that was later because they didn't come out until nine,
[39:19.720 --> 39:21.200]  98 was the original iMac.
[39:21.200 --> 39:24.280]  And then 99 was when the colored ones came out, but then they did.
[39:24.280 --> 39:24.520]  Yeah.
[39:24.520 --> 39:29.160]  They had like, I forget if the software could tell what color your iMac was
[39:29.160 --> 39:33.920]  though and default to it, but yeah, you could pick like highlight colors that
[39:33.920 --> 39:36.280]  matched your, your candy colored iMac.
[39:37.760 --> 39:39.040]  Now you can't do any of that stuff.
[39:39.040 --> 39:40.240]  That's, that's probably okay.
[39:40.600 --> 39:40.960]  Yeah.
[39:40.960 --> 39:41.960]  Well, I don't know.
[39:42.040 --> 39:45.040]  Is there anything I I've gotten old and crotchety.
[39:45.040 --> 39:45.600]  So I don't know.
[39:45.600 --> 39:46.520]  I don't look either.
[39:46.560 --> 39:47.440]  Maybe there is.
[39:47.720 --> 39:49.800]  I wonder whether there's still something like that.
[39:49.800 --> 39:53.160]  Cause the, there used to be something in the early days of Mac OS 10, where
[39:53.160 --> 39:54.200]  you could switch the theme.
[39:54.800 --> 39:56.280]  It was from sanity.
[39:56.280 --> 39:56.760]  Yeah.
[39:57.360 --> 39:57.680]  Oh yeah.
[39:57.680 --> 39:58.760]  Hey, look at that appearance.
[39:58.760 --> 40:02.800]  You can go, Oh, guess these are, these are many different options here.
[40:02.800 --> 40:10.080]  You can pick blue or graphite and then you can change the highlight color, but
[40:10.080 --> 40:12.440]  yeah, blue or gray are your choices now.
[40:12.480 --> 40:13.120]  That's all right.
[40:14.440 --> 40:21.560]  Maybe, um, yeah, and, and you know, this is obviously now just, uh, just, uh, fan
[40:21.560 --> 40:27.720]  fiction almost, but I wonder if the Mac hardware will ever kind of more closely
[40:27.720 --> 40:33.960]  reflect the iOS hardware, like, you know, the five C type plastic, like the return
[40:33.960 --> 40:35.680]  of the iBook or something like that.
[40:35.720 --> 40:42.120]  Um, it just, I was, uh, testing out that new Microsoft surface this week and it
[40:42.120 --> 40:46.200]  reminded me just how old the Mac book air design is.
[40:46.200 --> 40:52.840]  I mean, it's now six years old, almost the current Mac book air.
[40:52.840 --> 40:57.040]  So, and it was funny cause Microsoft's like, Hey, look, this thing is lighter
[40:57.040 --> 41:01.720]  than a Mac book air, but I'm like, yeah, that Mac book air is six years old, man.
[41:02.840 --> 41:03.200]  Yeah.
[41:03.200 --> 41:07.840]  And it looks to me, the part that really kind of looks a little dated is the, uh,
[41:08.200 --> 41:10.360]  the bezel around the screen, right?
[41:10.400 --> 41:10.720]  It was right.
[41:10.720 --> 41:15.440]  So they over, yeah, you've got like this inch thick frame around the screen and
[41:15.440 --> 41:19.680]  that the only part that is black glass or plastic, I guess it's not glass, but you
[41:19.680 --> 41:22.480]  know, shiny black screen is the screen.
[41:22.480 --> 41:29.680]  Whereas on the Mac book pros, they've got this to me, much more modern look,
[41:29.720 --> 41:33.560]  which looks like it matches the phone and matches the iPad.
[41:33.560 --> 41:37.000]  It matches the iMac, which goes edge to edge.
[41:37.000 --> 41:44.320]  Now matches the, the current displays where the whole front surface is black
[41:44.560 --> 41:47.720]  glass or black shiny screen material.
[41:47.720 --> 41:52.520]  And then not all of it is actually screen pixels, but it's just surrounded by,
[41:52.600 --> 41:54.200]  you know, black screen.
[41:55.160 --> 41:59.720]  It strikes me as a kind of thing that they've learned so much since then with
[41:59.720 --> 42:04.920]  the iPhone and with the other Macs, that there's a lot of improvements they could
[42:04.920 --> 42:09.960]  make if they were, you know, redesigning the laptop from scratch today.
[42:10.240 --> 42:10.400]  Yeah.
[42:10.400 --> 42:18.200]  My, my guess though, is that they're waiting for retina errors to update that
[42:18.240 --> 42:22.400]  because they just came out last month with new Mac book errors.
[42:22.440 --> 42:22.760]  Yeah.
[42:22.760 --> 42:26.280]  I don't think they're gonna, and they're, you know, they're, they're, you know,
[42:26.320 --> 42:33.200]  the latest CPU kit from Intel and et cetera, et cetera, but it's, you know,
[42:33.200 --> 42:38.200]  what we call in the business, a speed bump update, not a major update, but
[42:38.200 --> 42:41.880]  a major update, but given that it just came out last month, I can't imagine
[42:41.880 --> 42:43.040]  they're going to go retina soon.
[42:43.160 --> 42:47.960]  And I can't, therefore, I think that when they do go retina, they'll get the modern
[42:47.960 --> 42:50.440]  look where the whole front, when you open it up is black.
[42:51.000 --> 42:51.200]  Yeah.
[42:51.200 --> 42:56.920]  Unless they introduced that as a new line, which they kind of did with the retina
[42:57.000 --> 43:04.240]  pro because they kept the older pro around, who knows now this is silly.
[43:04.760 --> 43:07.000]  Well, that's the sort of thing.
[43:07.000 --> 43:07.560]  That's a good question.
[43:07.560 --> 43:09.520]  I mean, if they did it with the pros, they could do it.
[43:10.080 --> 43:13.840]  They could do whatever they want, but I kind of think they wouldn't because it
[43:13.840 --> 43:20.400]  seems to me that that sort of bifurcation of the product line, it, you can do it
[43:20.400 --> 43:25.080]  with a device that's pro and you kind of can't with the air because the air is
[43:25.080 --> 43:26.240]  just sort of the default.
[43:26.240 --> 43:30.200]  The air is you walk in the Apple store and they say, how can I help you?
[43:30.200 --> 43:31.480]  And you say, I want to get a laptop.
[43:32.560 --> 43:34.800]  They're going to, you know, the odds are pretty good.
[43:34.800 --> 43:37.000]  You're coming out with a 13 inch Mac book air.
[43:37.000 --> 43:39.960]  Yeah, because it's just the default.
[43:39.960 --> 43:43.440]  It's the one that's the cheap, it's cheaper, you know, and, and I know that
[43:43.440 --> 43:45.320]  the pros have gotten, it's crazy.
[43:45.320 --> 43:49.160]  If you remember how much power books used to cost back in the day, it's crazy
[43:49.160 --> 43:54.960]  that you can get a 13 inch Mac book pro with a retina display for 1299.
[43:54.960 --> 44:00.240]  I think the starting prices, which is crazy, but nine 99 is a lot less than 1299.
[44:00.480 --> 44:02.880]  You know, you're talking 25% less.
[44:03.320 --> 44:03.640]  Yeah.
[44:03.760 --> 44:04.800]  More than 25%.
[44:04.800 --> 44:05.040]  Right.
[44:05.040 --> 44:09.760]  Yeah. And when you add a hundred bucks for tax or whatever, it's, you know,
[44:10.320 --> 44:13.040]  you know, and it's that there's, you know, there's, it's just one of those,
[44:13.280 --> 44:17.520]  all those, every time you go up a digit, it's a magic price.
[44:17.520 --> 44:23.400]  Like nine 99 is a lot less than a thousand dollars in, in people's minds.
[44:25.400 --> 44:25.840]  Yeah.
[44:26.160 --> 44:28.200]  In real life, which is lovely in real life.
[44:28.200 --> 44:33.680]  It's a dollar a penny of it if you charge the 99 cents, but it just feels,
[44:33.680 --> 44:35.120]  it just feels like it's cheaper.
[44:35.840 --> 44:40.760]  Uh, so are you shipping a new Vesper by WWC this year?
[44:40.800 --> 44:42.960]  Uh, it could be any day.
[44:42.960 --> 44:46.600]  Uh, cause I remember that's when you launched last year, right?
[44:46.600 --> 44:46.760]  Yeah.
[44:47.000 --> 44:50.840]  I w I, if, if we were approved, I would tell you right now, but we're not,
[44:50.880 --> 44:54.560]  but it should be a knock on wood.
[44:54.600 --> 44:58.160]  If everything goes through, it should be, uh, before WWDC should be well before
[44:58.160 --> 45:00.360]  WWDC last year was, it was pretty tight.
[45:01.080 --> 45:02.920]  And this, but this is not the sync update.
[45:02.920 --> 45:04.600]  Or maybe you shouldn't tell me what it is.
[45:05.080 --> 45:07.800]  Uh, I'll tell you, don't tell anybody else though.
[45:07.800 --> 45:09.160]  It is the sync update.
[45:09.200 --> 45:09.880]  Oh wow.
[45:09.960 --> 45:10.360]  Okay.
[45:11.400 --> 45:17.160]  While we were, uh, let me take another break before we keep going, um, and tell
[45:17.160 --> 45:24.560]  you about our second sponsor and it's our good friend, good friends at linda.com.
[45:25.680 --> 45:31.640]  Linda.com helps you learn and keep up to date with your software, pick up brand
[45:31.640 --> 45:36.560]  new skills, explore new hobbies with their easy to follow video tutorials.
[45:37.160 --> 45:42.000]  So whether you want to learn to develop, uh, apps, I want to learn to program
[45:42.000 --> 45:46.640]  websites, pick up a programming language like objective C or something more
[45:46.640 --> 45:50.960]  creative, you want to learn how to, you've got like a really good digital camera,
[45:50.960 --> 45:54.200]  but all you do is just turn it on and press the button and you never do
[45:54.200 --> 45:54.760]  anything with it.
[45:54.760 --> 45:58.240]  You want to learn how, how, how can you learn to be a good amateur photographer?

[46:03.240 --> 46:10.560]  More are added weekly, uh, and one low monthly price, 25 bucks a month.
[46:10.600 --> 46:14.920]  It gets you on limited access to the entire linda.com library.
[46:14.960 --> 46:19.160]  To me, that's key to the whole thing because you don't have to think, ah,
[46:19.200 --> 46:21.280]  it's two bucks for this video, three bucks for this fee.
[46:21.280 --> 46:23.280]  I don't know if it's going to be worth it cause I have to spend the three
[46:23.280 --> 46:23.800]  bucks to do it.
[46:24.200 --> 46:26.280]  You just sign up for a linda.com account.
[46:27.640 --> 46:28.400]  It's unlimited.
[46:28.400 --> 46:29.880]  Start watching the video.
[46:29.880 --> 46:31.480]  If it is what you want, you've got it.
[46:31.480 --> 46:33.200]  If it's not, stop it and go back.
[46:33.240 --> 46:34.800]  Keep looking until you find the one you do want.
[46:35.680 --> 46:39.200]  Uh, all of their courses are produced at the highest quality, really high
[46:39.200 --> 46:43.760]  production level, really good, talented teachers.
[46:43.800 --> 46:47.400]  So it's not at all like it's like the polar opposite of the homemade videos
[46:47.400 --> 46:51.800]  you find on YouTube, uh, where anybody, it's a crap shoot, whether it's going
[46:51.800 --> 46:54.920]  to help you, whether the person actually knows what they're talking about,
[46:54.920 --> 46:59.920]  whether the video is actually technically even any good, uh, courses are
[46:59.920 --> 47:01.800]  broken down into bite-sized pieces.
[47:01.920 --> 47:05.800]  So whether you have 15 minutes or 15 hours, you can learn at your own pace on
[47:05.800 --> 47:06.480]  your own terms.
[47:07.280 --> 47:09.600]  A great deal, really great videos.
[47:09.920 --> 47:11.240]  Like I said, 2,400 of them.
[47:11.240 --> 47:12.440]  It's just unbelievable.
[47:12.960 --> 47:16.480]  Uh, and, and everything from technical stuff to creative stuff.
[47:16.520 --> 47:17.120]  Really great.
[47:17.160 --> 47:18.560]  They've been all around for a long time.
[47:18.880 --> 47:19.520]  Here's the best part.
[47:19.880 --> 47:23.880]  I've got to deal with them for the sponsorship of this show where you have
[47:23.880 --> 47:30.880]  access to their entire library free for seven days, so sign up for seven days.
[47:30.880 --> 47:34.200]  Watch as many of these videos as you want and they're, that's how sure they
[47:34.200 --> 47:35.840]  are that you'll sign up afterwards.
[47:35.920 --> 47:36.680]  How do you do that?
[47:37.000 --> 47:46.880]  Go to lynda.com L Y N D a.com slash the talk show lynda.com with a Y slash the
[47:46.880 --> 47:49.080]  talk show, you'll get seven days free.
[47:49.800 --> 47:51.480]  The whole library unlocked.
[47:51.480 --> 47:55.640]  And if there's anything like that you're curious about and want to learn, I cannot
[47:55.640 --> 47:56.560]  recommend it highly enough.
[47:56.560 --> 47:57.880]  It's great, great stuff.
[47:58.440 --> 47:59.600]  My thanks to lynda.com.
[48:00.000 --> 48:05.520]  So you mentioned your surface pro review or first look.
[48:05.600 --> 48:07.080]  This is not a review.
[48:07.160 --> 48:08.520]  Well, let's take a step back though.
[48:08.520 --> 48:13.280]  So, so since last you were on the talk show, you've picked up a new gig.
[48:13.280 --> 48:16.800]  You're now, I don't know, forget your title, but you're like the new technology
[48:16.800 --> 48:18.480]  columnist at quartz.
[48:19.000 --> 48:19.480]  Yes.
[48:19.480 --> 48:21.640]  Uh, this started a week ago.
[48:21.720 --> 48:28.760]  Um, I'm the tech editor at quartz, which means I'll be writing, um, several posts
[48:28.760 --> 48:32.920]  a week, probably one a day, maybe a little more than that, maybe less depending on
[48:32.920 --> 48:34.520]  the, uh, the news flow.
[48:34.760 --> 48:39.280]  And then also building out a team of journalists, um, around the world.
[48:39.280 --> 48:43.000]  Actually, that's one of the really cool things about quartz, which I guess I
[48:43.000 --> 48:44.800]  should explain what quartz is.
[48:44.800 --> 48:51.280]  It's a relatively new business news site owned by the Atlantic, uh, that started
[48:51.280 --> 48:58.440]  in 2012 and their whole thing is that it is what, you know, they sat down and they
[48:58.440 --> 49:02.760]  said, if you were starting a business news site in 2012, what would it be?
[49:03.320 --> 49:10.160]  Um, well, it would be designed first for phones and tablets and less for a desktop
[49:10.160 --> 49:12.560]  computer because talk show.
[49:12.560 --> 49:15.600]  The talk show during fireball.
[49:17.600 --> 49:20.720]  Well, I'm sorry, keep going down, uh, because that's where people will be
[49:20.720 --> 49:21.280]  reading it.
[49:21.320 --> 49:25.200]  Uh, it'll be global because people fly around a lot and, and real business
[49:25.200 --> 49:29.960]  leaders are thinking about what's going on in Asia, just as much as what's going
[49:29.960 --> 49:30.960]  on in at home.
[49:31.000 --> 49:37.880]  And, um, and, uh, you know, it'll have new forms of advertising and they've never
[49:37.880 --> 49:42.680]  really, I don't, I've never seen in the history of the site, any standard banner
[49:42.680 --> 49:43.440]  ads on the site.
[49:43.440 --> 49:50.720]  They do these special custom kind of big ads that, um, that work for a mobile site
[49:50.760 --> 49:52.280]  and for a desktop site.
[49:52.280 --> 49:53.040]  So it's really cool.
[49:53.040 --> 49:55.760]  The staff is, uh, it's pretty small.
[49:55.760 --> 49:57.920]  It's really, really smart people there.
[49:58.400 --> 50:01.600]  The editor in chief is this guy, Kevin Delaney, who was at the wall street
[50:01.600 --> 50:05.800]  journal for a long time and was, um, one of their leading tech journalists there.
[50:05.800 --> 50:08.800]  So I was not looking for a job.
[50:08.800 --> 50:13.600]  I mean, I've been working on my startup city notes for a long time now, and we're
[50:13.600 --> 50:18.680]  going to be shipping a brand new app in the next few months that, you know, could
[50:18.680 --> 50:20.560]  be a big thing someday.
[50:20.600 --> 50:26.480]  Um, but when the existing tech editor from quartz left recently for the wall
[50:26.480 --> 50:30.520]  street journal, I emailed Kevin and say, Hey man, let's, let's get together and
[50:30.520 --> 50:33.840]  talk because I've long been a huge fan of the site.
[50:33.840 --> 50:35.800]  Um, I think they do really cool stuff.
[50:35.840 --> 50:40.080]  They, uh, one of the really interesting things there is that they have a team of
[50:40.080 --> 50:44.640]  engineers that sits in the newsroom and work with journalists and, and our
[50:44.640 --> 50:50.200]  journalists themselves, uh, and make little apps and interactive stories and
[50:50.200 --> 50:56.200]  tools for the newsroom to either do reporting or to tell stories.
[50:56.200 --> 51:03.600]  Like we have a chart building tool that, um, you know, was made by one of the
[51:03.600 --> 51:06.080]  quartz engineers for the quartz newsroom.
[51:06.200 --> 51:07.320]  Um, so it's really cool.
[51:07.320 --> 51:11.360]  It's kind of, you know, if you, if you were taking all the elements of a news
[51:11.560 --> 51:17.120]  organization and creating them from scratch, you know, in this era, um, it's
[51:17.120 --> 51:18.560]  a really good representation of that.
[51:18.600 --> 51:20.920]  So I'm really excited to join the team.
[51:20.960 --> 51:26.240]  I'm, I have not been writing much lately, so I'm quite rusty, but I posted a few
[51:26.240 --> 51:30.200]  things last week and, um, hope you'll all follow me there.
[51:30.200 --> 51:34.200]  It's a very simple URL designed for the mobile era.
[51:34.240 --> 51:35.800]  It's qz.com.
[51:36.600 --> 51:41.160]  Uh, you know, the element courts, I believe is that, is that there, uh, is
[51:41.160 --> 51:47.080]  that the, it's been a while since the, uh, periodic table, but, uh, it's really
[51:47.080 --> 51:47.400]  cool.
[51:47.400 --> 51:48.840]  I'm really happy to be there.
[51:48.880 --> 51:54.480]  I'll be covering, you know, the same stuff that I did on my old site splat F,
[51:54.480 --> 52:01.600]  which is Apple, Microsoft, Google kind of big tech mobile, um, and I'll hopefully
[52:01.600 --> 52:06.880]  get to do some travel as well, looking up cool stories around the world that, you
[52:06.880 --> 52:12.240]  know, most, uh, desk bound tech, you know, sites aren't really touching.
[52:12.240 --> 52:16.800]  So they, they courts has been interesting to me ever since it debuted.
[52:16.840 --> 52:21.680]  And it's cooler for me that somebody who I know like you is going to be writing
[52:21.680 --> 52:23.400]  there, but they've always had good stuff.
[52:23.400 --> 52:26.400]  They've always had an interesting design where it doesn't really look like
[52:26.400 --> 52:27.560]  anybody else's stuff.
[52:28.320 --> 52:34.840]  Uh, they were really early to me on that, the infinite scroll where when you keep
[52:34.840 --> 52:38.360]  get, you get to the end of a, of an article and instead of a bottom of the
[52:38.360 --> 52:42.920]  page, they just sort of algorithmically predict what this might be something else
[52:42.920 --> 52:43.720]  you're interested in.
[52:44.080 --> 52:46.960]  You can close the window if you want, but if you want to keep scrolling down,
[52:46.960 --> 52:47.840]  here's another article.
[52:48.600 --> 52:49.000]  Yeah.
[52:49.000 --> 52:52.600]  And that's, you know, for better or worse, I think it works really great on
[52:52.600 --> 52:56.920]  mobile when, you know, Hey, if you're still connected to the network, here's
[52:56.920 --> 52:57.880]  something else to read.
[52:58.320 --> 53:02.680]  Um, sometimes at the computer, it's a little, uh, frustrating cause you want to
[53:02.680 --> 53:04.560]  share the previous story that you'd read.
[53:04.560 --> 53:07.840]  And then all of a sudden you're at the next one, but they've written that, you
[53:07.840 --> 53:11.880]  know, again, they have engineers in the newsroom, so they're making changes in
[53:11.880 --> 53:16.200]  real time as they, um, decide whether something's working or not.
[53:16.240 --> 53:20.720]  Well, that reminds me of Adrian Holovaty, you know, Adrian Holovaty, he was like,
[53:20.720 --> 53:25.960]  I know the name, co-creator of the Django Python framework and a bunch of other
[53:25.960 --> 53:30.880]  stuff from Chicago, but he's been on, I mean, longer than anybody and maybe even
[53:30.880 --> 53:38.200]  close to a decade, but at least from like 2006, 2007 on programming as journalism,
[53:39.000 --> 53:45.560]  you know, that, that it's now that the, that the output device for so much
[53:45.560 --> 53:50.000]  journalism is a computer, that it's not a piece of paper with ink on it, and it's
[53:50.000 --> 53:54.800]  not a TV screen getting something broadcast to millions of people
[53:54.800 --> 53:59.000]  identically, that it's this device that can compute, that it's almost criminal
[53:59.000 --> 54:03.800]  not to take advantage of it, that, and that we can't, you can't just hire, or
[54:03.840 --> 54:08.280]  not can't, but that the way to take advantage of it is not just to hire
[54:08.280 --> 54:12.280]  programmers to build you a CMS and then they go away and you're, you just sit
[54:12.280 --> 54:16.400]  there and type text into it and paste pictures into it, but that they're a
[54:16.400 --> 54:21.920]  full-time part of the team in the same way that a TV studio, a TV news is
[54:21.920 --> 54:25.920]  always going to have cameramen, that a website should always have programmers.
[54:26.440 --> 54:29.680]  And that you wouldn't, the same way that you wouldn't get rid of cameramen at a
[54:29.680 --> 54:33.360]  TV station, you know, you wouldn't just have them come in at the beginning and
[54:33.360 --> 54:36.480]  set the cameras up in the studio and say, here's the angles they should be at.
[54:36.480 --> 54:37.400]  Now you're on your own.
[54:37.400 --> 54:41.560]  Just, just hit this button when you want the camera to record, you know, you
[54:41.560 --> 54:44.160]  wouldn't want it, you don't want to dismiss the programmers after they've
[54:44.160 --> 54:44.760]  built the system.
[54:44.760 --> 54:49.280]  No, and I think like having worked in a few newsrooms now, there, in many
[54:49.320 --> 54:53.720]  organizations, there tends to be a combative relationship between product
[54:53.760 --> 54:59.800]  and, um, and the journalists, because, you know, sure, every CMS has flaws.
[54:59.800 --> 55:04.560]  So if you're just sitting around and ragging on this crappy CMS, you know,
[55:04.560 --> 55:08.960]  you're, you're probably not, um, thinking that the nicest thoughts about the
[55:08.960 --> 55:12.960]  people who made it for you, um, and often are, you know, trashing them.
[55:12.960 --> 55:17.040]  Whereas if they're sitting next to you and you are working on stuff together,
[55:17.480 --> 55:19.360]  um, it's a really cool opportunity.
[55:19.440 --> 55:26.080]  Uh, it's also made me personally realize that I need to learn to code too.
[55:26.160 --> 55:30.480]  Um, you know, I've been programming websites since the mid nineties.
[55:30.480 --> 55:36.200]  So I've known HTML and later CSS since, you know, since it was a thing, but I
[55:36.200 --> 55:40.720]  never took the dive into kind of more advanced stuff.
[55:40.720 --> 55:46.240]  And now I realize, especially the last six months, um, working with my friend
[55:46.280 --> 55:51.320]  Mark Dorison on city notes, uh, kind of feeling like a helpless loser, not
[55:51.320 --> 55:55.720]  being able to help out with, um, with building our iOS stuff.
[55:55.720 --> 56:00.200]  So I know it's going to take a lot of time, but, and it's kind of corny, but
[56:00.280 --> 56:05.480]  in this era, it feels like coding skills are almost like freedom.
[56:05.480 --> 56:10.240]  So that's one of the things I'm going to spend some of my time on.
[56:10.240 --> 56:13.360]  I spare time on now, I've already started actually.
[56:13.440 --> 56:18.400]  I don't want to abuse the metaphor, but I'll compare it to, uh, camera work
[56:18.400 --> 56:22.160]  again, where, you know, there was a time when it was so comp, you know, in
[56:22.160 --> 56:25.480]  the film days when you had so much going on just to take pictures where, you
[56:25.480 --> 56:29.080]  know, not many people learned to take photographs, but now everybody has
[56:29.080 --> 56:30.360]  cameras with them all the time.
[56:31.120 --> 56:35.360]  And not that everybody is going to be a pro photographer and not that you are
[56:35.360 --> 56:39.640]  going to become a top-notch developer, but it's like, you should have, you know,
[56:39.640 --> 56:42.840]  maybe everybody should have a basic fluency in it, you know, be able to
[56:42.840 --> 56:45.680]  write a little code and everybody should learn a little bit so you can
[56:45.680 --> 56:46.840]  take a decent picture.
[56:47.320 --> 56:52.280]  Like maybe, well, you know, you're out, you're a journalist, you see something,
[56:52.320 --> 56:55.680]  you should be able to get as good a photograph as your, you know, your
[56:55.680 --> 56:57.000]  iPhone is capable of taking.
[56:57.960 --> 57:02.320]  I think also the mobile era, you know, has a lot to do with it, at least for
[57:02.320 --> 57:07.400]  me, because back in the day, like I would buy, oh boy, I bought like student
[57:07.400 --> 57:10.440]  edition of, uh, what was it? Code Warrior.
[57:10.480 --> 57:13.440]  Where were the, what was the old, you know, and I tried learning that.
[57:13.440 --> 57:16.760]  I bought books like learn C on the Macintosh Metroworks.
[57:17.040 --> 57:17.880]  Yeah, right.
[57:18.280 --> 57:24.080]  And it never took like, I never got past hello world in part because I, you
[57:24.080 --> 57:27.640]  know, I'd sit there at my desk and think, well, if I could make a Mac app,
[57:27.680 --> 57:28.600]  what would I make?
[57:28.680 --> 57:31.800]  I'm not going to make like an email client or something like that.
[57:31.800 --> 57:33.920]  So, and then the web came out.
[57:33.920 --> 57:36.240]  So I just kind of started goofing around on the web.
[57:36.240 --> 57:41.120]  But now in the iPhone era, like I have an unlimited list of cool
[57:41.120 --> 57:42.480]  apps that I would want to make.
[57:42.560 --> 57:47.040]  And, um, and so one of the things that's, that, that has kind of stuck
[57:47.040 --> 57:51.600]  with me over the last week is I've been, um, starting to learn JavaScript.
[57:52.000 --> 57:57.360]  Uh, just kind of getting my feet wet is it's strange and unfortunate that
[57:57.360 --> 58:01.920]  there is no kind of iPad native programming environment and maybe
[58:01.920 --> 58:05.040]  I'm totally missing it, but there I've never heard of one that's, that's
[58:05.040 --> 58:08.480]  has any traction or has any acclaim.
[58:08.560 --> 58:13.280]  And, you know, I, so I'm like, you know, starting with these programming
[58:13.280 --> 58:17.920]  lessons and I have to sit at my computer at a desk and it feels weird in this.
[58:18.000 --> 58:18.480]  Okay.
[58:18.600 --> 58:19.640]  See, I don't know about that.
[58:19.680 --> 58:23.840]  C O D E a, uh, definitely worth checking out.
[58:24.120 --> 58:25.080]  Okay, cool.
[58:25.560 --> 58:26.120]  I forget the one.
[58:26.120 --> 58:27.160]  This wouldn't be good for you.
[58:27.160 --> 58:28.240]  It's more for kids.
[58:28.240 --> 58:31.320]  There's a great one for kids that Jonas has on his iPad.
[58:31.480 --> 58:32.000]  Oh, cool.
[58:32.000 --> 58:36.200]  It's, it's less code and a little bit more visual, uh, CODEA is
[58:36.200 --> 58:37.560]  probably the one worth checking out.
[58:38.560 --> 58:41.200]  People on, uh, people who are out there, let's send us Twitter,
[58:41.280 --> 58:42.640]  send it, hit us up on Twitter.
[58:43.080 --> 58:43.280]  Yeah.
[58:43.280 --> 58:46.040]  From dome on Twitter is my, uh, Twitter handle.
[58:46.040 --> 58:48.160]  Let me know what, what I should be doing.
[58:48.360 --> 58:48.640]  All right.
[58:49.080 --> 58:50.960]  And that's a new nuke tips.
[58:51.040 --> 58:55.320]  Um, but you know, and this is one of the things like I cover at during
[58:55.320 --> 58:58.440]  the day is the post PC shift.
[58:58.440 --> 59:04.200]  Like I did an article this week at courts about, um, tablet sales are
[59:04.200 --> 59:09.240]  actually on pace to match PC sales this year, or at least come very close.
[59:09.240 --> 59:11.360]  And by next year far surpassed them.
[59:11.840 --> 59:16.440]  Um, but you still can't make a tablet app on a tablet, which
[59:16.760 --> 59:21.880]  well, and that's the problem that CODEA ran into is that they ran into it's out.
[59:21.880 --> 59:26.560]  You get it, but they've run into a lot of hassle with the app store in terms
[59:26.560 --> 59:30.800]  of like you can do the interpreting code or something like that.
[59:31.240 --> 59:33.520]  I think that they're using JavaScript.
[59:33.520 --> 59:37.360]  So there's a rule that you're not supposed to include a third party
[59:37.360 --> 59:40.600]  interpreter, but if you want to have interpreted code, you could use
[59:40.600 --> 59:45.160]  the Webkits JavaScript and, and have at it, but you can't, they wanted
[59:45.160 --> 59:48.280]  to have it where you could maybe like save your sample project.
[59:48.360 --> 59:51.960]  And then I could download your sample project and run it in CODEA.
[59:51.960 --> 59:55.800]  But then all of a sudden that runs a foul of the, Hey, are you distributing
[59:55.800 --> 59:57.000]  apps, right?
[59:57.200 --> 01:00:02.520]  Like you make a game in CODEA and then you send me the game thing, and now
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:07.080]  I can open it in my copy of CODEA and I have a new game running and I
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.360]  didn't get it through the app store.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:12.960]  And so that was like, so I forget all the crazy hoops they have to jump through,
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:17.440]  but it's, it makes it all, it's all worse for the overall experience
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:22.760]  for the benefit of Apple's, uh, control overall app distribution.
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.920]  And, uh, you know, there are, there are constraints like, you know, typing
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:30.280]  in stuff on an iPad is kind of annoying still, and I get it, but it'd be
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:37.720]  cool if either Apple or a third party were to come out with a fairly, you
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:43.520]  know, sophisticated, um, yet iPad designed coding environment.
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:43.840]  Yep.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:49.080]  Well, remember, remember when we were kids and we would get magazines
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.240]  with programs in them, right.
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:54.200]  It would be like, you know, here's a program that, you know,
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:54.960]  here's a simple one.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:55.720]  I mean, this is stupid.
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:59.080]  You could write this in 10 lines or, you know, three lines of basic, you
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:03.360]  know, but, you know, enter your weight on earth, here's what you weigh on the
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.560]  moon and here's what you would weigh on Jupiter, and then you would type
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:11.280]  it into your, you know, your Apple two or your TI 99, four eight basic,
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:12.600]  and then you'd save it.
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.360]  And then you'd type run the name of the program and it would run.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:19.400]  But to duplicate these programs, they were printed in magazines and you'd
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:23.360]  sit the magazine next to the computer and type them in and that's how I
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:27.760]  learned a lot of HTML actually from the net magazine teaching me like
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:30.080]  tables and that kind of stuff, you know?
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:33.320]  And it's crazy that when, when now that we've invented things like the
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:36.920]  internet and copy and paste and downloading and stuff like that, that
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:40.360]  that's sort of how you have to use CODIA because they don't want you to
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:45.680]  distribute things that you just tap and open and run.
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.040]  And so you're stuck retyping all this stuff.
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:50.000]  It's, you know, but anyway, it's worth checking out.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:50.680]  Yep.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:51.520]  Yeah.
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.520]  And I remember actually, I think Google made some sort of very simple
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:02:00.400]  Android, um, you know, like almost drag and drop programming tool, but I
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.320]  don't think it took off and they probably shut it down.
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:02.800]  You know what?
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:09.200]  That's an interesting point because Android doesn't have the, the, the iron
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:14.400]  fisted control over executing code that, that by design, not, not like it's,
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.560]  you know, this is a weakness.
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:19.560]  This is a difference of opinion, you know?
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:24.160]  So, you know, you could buy a nexus and, you know, stock app, you know,
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:27.800]  this is the stock Google Android device and nexus, whatever the latest
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:32.960]  phone is, and you can go into settings and say, allow, you know, applications
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:36.080]  from third parties, and then it'll say, are you sure this is, you know,
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.480]  could open you up to security problems.
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:38.920]  You say, don't worry, I know what I'm doing.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:43.200]  And then you can install apps from anywhere and you, you know, with no
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:47.640]  developer signing and stuff like that, you can just install apps on your device.
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:52.800]  Um, so there's an opportunity there where they could have something like a, a sort
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:55.440]  of next generation hypercard, right?
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:58.160]  I mean, that's, that's what everybody always comes back to is they come back
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:01.960]  to hypercard because hypercard and the reason people keep coming back to
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:10.640]  hypercard is that hypercard when people, you know, if, if, if, I don't know what
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:12.360]  the percentage of people who can program is.
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:17.360]  Let's just ballpark and say 5% of people, if they want to can program
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:21.760]  like an objective C apps, probably lower than that, I would say less than one.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:22.160]  Yeah.
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:24.120]  Let's say, all right, let's be more realistic.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:24.960]  That's 0.5%.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.960]  Let's say 1% of people have that, that aptitude.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:34.960]  And it's a combination of, of ability and desire because it's so hard and complicated.
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:38.680]  You just can't make yourself do it unless you're driven to do it.
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:45.560]  And there's, you know, hypercard was a thing where way more, maybe 5% of people
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:49.280]  who looked at hypercard and had ideas for a little thing they could program, or,
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:52.320]  you know, if you click a button, this happens and you could click this button.
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:56.200]  And then you'd have a list of things that you could drag and drop to rearrange.
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:03.480]  That there was way more people who could just look at it, get it and, and, and not
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:07.200]  in terms of intelligence, I think entirely, although part of it is clearly
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:13.280]  intelligence, but it's also that, that level of obsession where if it was so
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:19.800]  much easier to do it and you didn't have to commit so much and learn at such a low
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.720]  level, you'd be willing to do it.
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.920]  You'd be willing to try, you know,
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.400]  Yeah, a little less abstract.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:29.400]  It's not, you know, uh, a text editor with gibberish in it.
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:32.600]  It, there's a lot more visual aspects.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:34.800]  They just, it just removed a lot of friction.
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:38.680]  And it just, and the lack of friction would encourage more people to try it.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:44.240]  In the same way that digital photography, you know, ultimately the best pictures
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:48.880]  we take, are they any better than the best pictures that were taken 50, 60 years ago?
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:53.960]  No, but way more pictures are being taken period because there's so much less
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:58.400]  friction, you just turn on these simple devices and exposure is computed
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.280]  automatically.
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:06.720]  Um, you know, the, the apertures computed automatically and it's, friction is
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:10.200]  removed and so people do it and that's what hypercard was.
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:14.160]  Hypercard was like a point and shoot camera for programming and there's nothing.
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.000]  Well, let's get that for iOS.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.560]  So if, if Phil Schiller, if you're listening, I'll help you out with this.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.480]  We'll, uh, we'll do it.
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:24.960]  Yeah, I think, and I think people, you know, people have tried stuff like that.
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:28.040]  And I think sometimes people may be thinking, well, you know, if you're
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:31.160]  in, I think sometimes people maybe get caught up because they want to boil the
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.080]  ocean all at once.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:35.760]  And they think, well, let's not just do iOS, let's do iOS and Android and let's
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:38.440]  have run in web browser too so that anybody, you could open it.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:42.600]  I say, start simple and maybe, you know, do that down, but get, do it and have it
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:43.840]  just run on the iPad.
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:44.640]  Right.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:50.000]  And then worry about, worry about other things next, get it running on the iPad
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.280]  and then expand to the iPhone and then think about Android and then, you know,
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:57.320]  but get it running one place at first.
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:00.520]  Anyway, I think Google has an opportunity there to do something Apple couldn't
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:07.280]  because Google could build a thing like that and not worry about the distribution
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:10.760]  of these, you know, the, in hypercard parlance, the stacks, right?
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:15.480]  Hypercard was the app and it ran stacks, whatever you want to call them, but you
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:18.680]  know, that you, they could allow people to distribute these things to other
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:22.520]  Android users and not, they don't care if you're not going through the play store
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:22.840]  anymore.
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:24.280]  Totally.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:25.240]  Yeah.
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:29.560]  And I think they started to try it, but then they, I don't know what happened
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:32.040]  with that weird thing that they made.
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:33.640]  Maybe it was just too simple.
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:37.320]  I think it was a typical Google thing where somebody, you know, some three
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:40.120]  people built the thing and there was never really anything behind it and they
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.280]  were like, well, ship it, you know, who cares?
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:44.920]  And then nobody ever even remembers it anymore.
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:45.960]  Yeah.
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:50.120]  And the Mac kind of has that with automator, but that's, you know, well, not
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:54.680]  really, that's not even close to hypercard, but I remember in the early
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:59.400]  automator days, actually, my friend ran a site called automator world, which
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:04.680]  was, you know, a community of automator, uh, recipes or whatever they were
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:05.080]  called.
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:07.800]  And that was pretty cool, but automators, cool.
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:12.840]  And Apple script still remains, you know, it's alive and well, but it's not
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:17.960]  thriving, you know, and it's not at all, you know, uh, but you know, there's
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.080]  little signs of health for it.
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:23.640]  Like, for example, I mean, the biggest sign of health for Apple script to me
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:29.880]  is that when the new versions of I work apps came out, the new pages, numbers,
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:38.680]  and, uh, keynote with this unified file format across iOS and the web and the
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.800]  Mac apps.
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:42.680]  And they took out all these, you know, all these features that were in the Mac
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:48.440]  were gone because they'd, they, you know, solidified the whole platform on
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:51.240]  this common denominator of features.
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:52.280]  Apple script was gone.
[01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.920]  But in the months since they've, they've brought it back.
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:58.280]  I don't think that they've brought entirely back, but it's mostly back, you
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:01.800]  know, that most of the things you could do in Apple script and those apps before
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:07.000]  you can do again, you know, it clearly wasn't enough of a priority to be there
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.240]  in their initial release, but it's enough of a priority that they got to it with
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.840]  before, before the end of the year.
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.040]  Yeah, that's good.
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:23.960]  Um, do you buy into the concept of a multi view, you know, two apps, two up
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:28.200]  apps on iOS or, cause I've been playing with that surface and I was, let's
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:28.600]  hold that.
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:29.720]  Let me do the third sponsor.
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:30.200]  Okay.
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:34.840]  Let's combine that with, uh, that for iOS combined with the surface.
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:35.400]  Okay, great.
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:37.640]  Um, third sponsor, final sponsor of the show.
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.560]  Great, great company.
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.680]  Uh, Harry's, what does Harry's provide?
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:47.720]  They provide, um, men's shaving goods.
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:49.800]  So the team behind Harvey's is there.
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.880]  They're, uh, I think one of the founders is one of the guys from Warby Parker,
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.840]  uh, the eyeglass people also a sponsor of the show.
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:01.160]  Uh, same basic idea though where Warby Parker's thing was why in the world are
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.320]  prescription eyeglasses so crazy expensive?
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:08.520]  Um, the team with Harry's is like, why does it cost so much to buy razor blades,
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:09.720]  uh, to shave?
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.400]  Why is this stuff so crazy expensive?
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:16.280]  Well, it doesn't have to be, uh, so what they've done is they've gone right to
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:16.680]  the source.
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:20.920]  They've, they're making, they even make their own razor blades.
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:27.560]  They purchased a 93 year old German factory that makes precision engineered
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:29.880]  German engineered razor blades.
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:31.080]  So they're making their own blades.
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:34.600]  They're not just like white labeling something that they're buying, you know,
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:37.000]  from some abandoned factory or something.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.320]  They're making brand new blades, brand new razors to hold them really cool,
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:43.960]  stylish stuff, really good, uh, equipment.
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:48.520]  Uh, and it gets shipped right to your door.
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:53.240]  They focus on providing men with a great shaving experience for a fraction of the
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:58.440]  price of the big name competitors had at least half the price of other brand name
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:02.120]  razor blades, better product design, less, but better.
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:06.120]  None of these fancy, you know, no, no fake chrome and stuff like that plastic
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:08.760]  stuff. You'd just go take a look at their stuff and you'll see what I mean.
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:13.960]  It's, it's classic design, not like the fake good design like you see from the
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:16.840]  Gillette or the other companies like that.
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:18.920]  Easy convenience.
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:22.200]  You don't have to go to a drug store where all the shaving stuff is blocked
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:24.760]  behind the cabinet because people shoplifted or something like that.
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:29.720]  You just order online and it shows up at your door so you don't have to go out.
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.400]  I don't want to go out buying stuff like that.
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:32.520]  Really good.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:36.120]  They've sent me a kit when I, when they first signed on as a sponsor and I've
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:36.520]  used it.
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:37.080]  Great stuff.
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:41.400]  It's, you know, it's good, good shaving cream, good, uh, good razor blades.
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:42.040]  Great stuff.
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:43.480]  So what do you do?
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:45.480]  How do you take advantage of this?
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.840]  Well, they have a promo code talk show.
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:52.120]  T A L K S H O W.

[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:31.720]  Father's day is coming up.
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.080]  God, it seems like a no brainer.
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.400]  So my thanks to Harry's.
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:39.800]  Go to harrys.com and remember the promo code talk show.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:41.240]  No, the just talk show.
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:43.800]  Uh, so my thanks to them.
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:50.120]  The, uh, the other Harry's guy, the non Warby Parker guy is an old friend of mine.
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.080]  Oh really?
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:51.320]  Yeah.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.720]  His, his wife married me.
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.000]  She not, not married me.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.680]  She officiated our wedding.
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:00.120]  There is a big difference.
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:00.920]  There is a big difference.
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:01.080]  Yeah.
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:02.040]  He was there too.
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:02.760]  It was cool.
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:03.080]  Wow.
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:06.200]  That's actually, you know, that's not like a, Hey, I met him the one time.
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:11.000]  That's actually like the guy was there for an important, uh, yeah, no, he's a
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:11.400]  good guy.
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:17.960]  That that's a, that's a really neat company that is, uh, smartly vertically
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:24.040]  integrated, uh, much like Warby Parker and a massive industry full of a bunch
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:24.680]  of clowns.
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:26.200]  So I hope they do really well.
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:26.680]  Yeah.
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:31.720]  I love all these stories of people who are getting into hardware of any kind.
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:32.520]  Oh yeah.
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:36.280]  Then, and, and I feel like there's so many opportunity, you know, we, our, our
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:39.720]  whole generation, we were all digital for so long and the web was such an
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:44.360]  eyeopener and we all built websites and spent, you know, first decade, two
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.960]  decades of our professional careers, shipping ones and zeros.
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:48.760]  And it was awesome.
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:52.200]  And I still, you know, everything I do is still mostly ones and zeros, right?
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:56.680]  Uh, Vespers, digital, daring fireballs, digital.
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:58.680]  Even the show is digital.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:02.440]  Um, although not entirely and I'll get back to that.
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:08.600]  Um, but I just love these people who are taking the same sort of, let's just
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:13.000]  stay lean and mean and vertically integrated and not have the waste of like
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:19.080]  a proctor and gamble gazillion head count conglomerate totally behind it.
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:24.360]  Um, yeah, let's, let's take this thing and let's just do it right.
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:28.680]  Let's, you know, let's start without all the baggage and do it right.
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:34.600]  And ultimately it ends up being cheaper for the consumer and in many cases
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:35.160]  better.
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:38.440]  I feel like, you know, it's like, it's like something that nobody really
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:44.520]  imagined, but like to me, going down the consumer aisles and like a drug
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:48.440]  store or like a target, if you're in the, you know, like shopping for deodorant
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:52.600]  or toothpaste or shaving cream or something like that, like 40 or 50 years
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:55.160]  ago, it would look like something out of science fiction.
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:59.240]  Like the way that when you go to buy crest, you, you have to choose between
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:01.880]  literally like 12 or 15 kinds of crest.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:06.440]  You know, that used to, you know, used to be, you'd switch between crest
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:08.600]  and Colgate and they were the rivals.
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:12.600]  And then like they've, they've gotten into this race to take up shelf space.
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:15.400]  And the only way they'll get the shelf space is if they have a bunch of
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:15.880]  varieties.
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:19.240]  So they have like 20 each have their own aisle at this point.
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:19.560]  Yeah.
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:23.880]  20 different kinds of crest to choose from or, or edge shaving gel.
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.960]  There's, there's 17 kinds of it.
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:28.680]  And like, I mean, I don't know which one to get.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:29.880]  I mean, I'm not an expert on it.
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:32.920]  Like I like these startups that are, you know, it's like here, look, here's
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:33.960]  good shave cream.
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:34.760]  Here it is.
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:35.560]  Harry's.
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:36.120]  Yeah.
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:37.320]  There's one flavor.
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:37.560]  Yeah.
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:38.120]  Here it is.
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:38.600]  And it's good.
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:39.800]  Here it is.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:40.840]  And that's it.
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:43.000]  Yeah.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:43.320]  I do.
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:43.800]  I love it.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:47.400]  Uh, anyway, I mean it, I know they're a sponsor.
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.640]  I am literally getting paid to tell you to go check them out.
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:50.600]  But I mean it there.
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.400]  It's, it's what I love about the show and doing this and getting these
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:56.600]  sponsors like this is that to me, they're doing fascinating and great
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:56.920]  work.
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:00.360]  I really, but that's actually, and not to, you know, plug your show, but
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:05.560]  that's part of, of doing that right is actually being in the right place
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:06.920]  to promote your company.
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:11.080]  I mean, yeah, I mean, Procter and Gamble, to my knowledge is not
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:13.640]  sponsoring tech podcasts.
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:17.240]  But if I wanted to reach the types of people that, you know, load up
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:20.920]  Amazon and drop a hundred bucks on nonsense, that, uh, that would be a
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:21.800]  good place to start.
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:24.680]  Uh, tablets.
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:29.560]  So you were at the surface announcement.
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.560]  Yeah, it was very strange.
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:35.000]  I was, it was like one of the first emails I got to my new quartz
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.800]  address was, Hey, do you want to come to this, uh, surface thing next
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:38.120]  week?
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.680]  And I said, yeah, sure.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:42.120]  And I didn't even know what it was.
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:43.880]  I thought I had no idea.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:48.200]  Like I didn't realize it was the unveiling of a new surface.
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:51.240]  Like I, I didn't realize that because you're not as tuned into that world
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.560]  as you are the Apple world where no.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.200]  Right.
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:57.160]  And they're, they're not on that regular schedule that Apple has.
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:57.400]  Right.
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:57.560]  Yeah.
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:00.920]  And it's in New York and it's Tuesday.
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:01.400]  I don't know.
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.320]  So I just wasn't expecting that.
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:06.760]  And then I showed up and they're like, here's the new surface and here's
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:07.640]  one to take with you.
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:10.520]  And, um, it was, it was interesting.
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:12.360]  So they didn't give you one to take with you.
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:15.560]  Yeah, I got, I have one it's, um, in my desk at the office.
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:20.280]  I don't have it here in front of me, but, um, it was in, you know,
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:23.000]  Satya Nadella, the new CEO of Microsoft was there.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.560]  He kicked off the event, uh, and what he said sounded good, actually,
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:32.600]  which was, you know, I had seen Balmer and Gates speak a few times
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:33.720]  at various things.
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:37.560]  And it always seemed like a lot of puffed up, uh, kind of corporate
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:40.440]  speak and, and Satya and Nadella.
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:42.120]  Actually sounded more human.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:46.680]  And you know, what he said was smart that they're making these devices
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:50.440]  and that every single product has to fit into their cloud strategy
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:51.320]  and all this stuff.
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:55.960]  Um, and then the guy who came on and kind of demoed the hardware was
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:17:00.120]  kind of a bozo and they were making all these really stupid jokes
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:04.040]  about Joanna Stern, the new wall street journal reviewer.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.320]  I don't know if you watched the video.
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:08.760]  It was just really awkward and not, not funny at all.
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:13.240]  I didn't watch the video, but I was following along on Twitter
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:16.200]  and I got the gist that they were making.
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.280]  They were referencing Joanna a lot.
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:18.520]  Yeah.
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:21.640]  And it was kind of funny the first time, but then they did it like four
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:22.360]  more times.
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:26.920]  It was, can you imagine like, uh, you know, Phil Schiller stopping
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:32.120]  an Apple keynote four times to rib Walt Mossberg about something?
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:32.680]  Right.
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:33.480]  Or me, right.
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:34.360]  What if he did it to me?
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:34.680]  Right.
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:36.920]  Hey, hey, John, remember that post you wrote?
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:37.240]  All right.
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:39.080]  And maybe once it's kind of funny.
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:43.880]  Um, well, and I guess it's because Joanna, um, who is, she was just on
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:47.240]  the show a couple months ago, but talking about these issues with
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:50.520]  tablets and laptops and can tablets, it was right after she had done.
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:53.240]  I'm sure this is why they referenced her is that she's done.
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:57.560]  She's been on this beat for a couple of years now of w you know, what's
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:02.040]  the ideal form factor for like a one and a half, one to two pound
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:04.680]  portable computer that you're going to do real work on?
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:05.480]  Is it a tablet?
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:06.840]  If so, how do you put it in a lab?
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:07.720]  How do you get a keyboard?
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:08.680]  How do you type fast?
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:11.720]  If it's not, if it's a laptop, you know, does it have a touch screen?
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.240]  What, what, what, where's this going?
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:18.200]  She's written a lot about it and she's done fantastic work reviewing
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:19.720]  a wide variety of stuff.
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:20.680]  So I'm sure that's why.
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:23.880]  I think she came from reviewing laptops.
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:28.120]  So she has probably, you know, if, if not the best, one of the best
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:33.400]  kind of, uh, histories in her brain of the evolution of these devices.
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:37.800]  So it makes sense that they would reference her during a keynote,
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:39.320]  I suppose once, but then.
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:40.520]  I don't know.
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:42.760]  It was, it was very weird.
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.920]  I think I tweeted something like Microsoft.
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:47.320]  You're still so Microsoft or something like that.
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.120]  And she was there.
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:49.800]  She that's there in the front row.
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:52.840]  And she had, she was curious why she was in the front row.
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:56.680]  And then she found out why it's cause she was part of the, uh, part of the play.
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:59.080]  She like went to take like a regular seat in the middle.
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:00.120]  And they're like, no, no, no.
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:00.360]  Yeah.
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.440]  Right down in front Joanna.
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:02.600]  Yeah.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:05.320]  So some of the stuff they did was actually kind of funny.
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:09.080]  Like, you know, they made, they kind of self-deprecating comment about
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:11.960]  how everybody in the audience was typing on a Mac book air.
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:19.320]  Um, but then, uh, I dunno, then it kind of dragged along and then I
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:21.480]  grabbed my surface and, and got out of there.
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.200]  Yeah, that's funny.
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:28.040]  That's like an interesting, I saw, I, and they definitely, I definitely
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:32.680]  noticed that they made a joke about the fact that, uh, the Mac book air is
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:38.520]  like stock issue for mid, I don't know what we call this decade, the tens,
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:42.760]  you know, in the tens tech journalists have Mac book airs.
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:46.200]  It's just, uh, it's just ridiculous what percentage.
[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:50.600]  And I, you know, most of my press events are Apple events, but even at
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:54.440]  like build when I was at build the, you know, in the press room, not
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:57.720]  everybody, and clearly there's a lot of windows devices in the build press
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:01.160]  room, but there was a crazy amount of Mac book errors too.
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:01.560]  Crazy.
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:01.880]  Yeah.
[01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:07.560]  And if this thing, it was pretty much all Macs, uh, it, I rarely see
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:14.120]  windows PCs in my life, which is kind of funny, but, uh, well, the thing
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:19.320]  to remember is that journalists, most of them are on a tight deadline.
[01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:20.920]  You know, they've got to file.
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:25.000]  If they're there today to cover the Microsoft surface event, they've got
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.280]  to have something ready to go pretty soon after the end.
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:32.600]  And a lot of people now a lot, most sites now they're taking photos and
[01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:35.960]  they're putting photos in and there's, it's more than just typing in a
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:37.640]  text area field and hitting a button.
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:42.040]  There's, you know, a CMS production system and you know, you kind of
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:48.600]  need your, you know, I don't test that many devices, but a lot of people
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:48.840]  do.
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:51.960]  But in terms of actually doing the work of covering the event, you want
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:53.880]  your go-to trustee.
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:59.080]  This is my thing, and it's got all the apps I need to, you know, get into
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:03.560]  the CMS to, you know, format this the way I want to format it, to get the
[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:06.920]  photos into where the photos go in the CMS so I can put them in the
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:08.040]  article and all this.
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:11.880]  And for most of the people working today, it's a, it's a Mac book air.
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:13.160]  Totally.
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:18.040]  And, you know, especially if you're carrying it around, um, the air is an
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:19.880]  amazing portable computer.
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:28.440]  So then, you know, the Microsoft argument seems to be that a tablet with
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:34.440]  a keyboard is better than a laptop because, and then they have different
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:38.200]  on, you know, one was that it's lighter than a Mac book air, which I
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:42.440]  don't, I don't, when you put that big keyboard thing on there, it's, I
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:43.400]  don't think it's lighter.
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:43.720]  I don't know.
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:47.960]  Well, they're a comparison and this is, to me, it's everybody called this
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:54.200]  out is that their weight comparison was the uncovered surface compared to
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:57.400]  the Mac book air, which has an attached cover.
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:04.040]  And if the 13 inch six year old Mac book air versus the, you know, brand
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:07.320]  new uncovered 12 inch.
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:13.240]  Well, the fact that the design is six years old doesn't, that's fair game.
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:14.040]  Oh yeah.
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:16.600]  It's, I mean, it's still shipping and it's, they just came out with new
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:22.680]  ones last month, you know, that's fair game, but I, it, it just doesn't
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:26.600]  seem like a fair comparison to say here, here's this device where a big
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:30.200]  part of it is that we've built this great cover with a keyboard and a
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:33.400]  great, a much improved over last year's track pad.
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:36.280]  And then when we compare it to this device that has a built-in keyboard
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:39.160]  and track pad, we're not going to put the cover on when we talk about
[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:39.640]  the weight.
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:40.760]  Right.
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:41.160]  Yeah.
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:44.360]  So that's, I mean, and that's also the kind of thing like, okay, but in
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:48.760]  your backpack with a few other things, there's really in, in use, I will
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:53.560]  say there's, there's no noticeable difference in, you know, how light one
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:56.040]  of those things feels next to the other one.
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:57.560]  And that's not even really the point.
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:03.400]  Like weight is not really the deciding factor in this it's, is this better
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:07.960]  for, and I guess they're straight up, just going after people who are
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:09.080]  using this for work.
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:13.000]  Like, you know, if you're the kind of person who is doing work on a
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.440]  laptop, which is really the only thing I use my laptop now for is
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:20.440]  straight up work, uh, is a tablet with a keyboard better.
[01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:24.040]  And it's still, to me, it just felt off.
[01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:27.320]  Um, and I haven't used it much and I, I really should use it more, but
[01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:33.160]  the idea of balancing this heavy screen and with this lighter keyboard
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:38.360]  that it's kind of attached to it, but not very rigid, just seems very
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:39.000]  awkward.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.240]  Um, I just, I would always rather have a laptop.
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:49.160]  And then, you know, for the stuff that I use a touch tablet for, have
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:55.000]  a separate tablet that is, you know, really designed for that and, you
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.880]  know, hardware and software and size and all that sort of stuff, um, for
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:05.720]  weight to really matter, it has to be like a next level.
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:08.920]  I mean, it's, it's all a little arbitrary, but it's gotta be like,
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:11.000]  Hey, this is actually like a game changer.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.600]  And an example I'll, I'll bring up is the MacBook air totally where a
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:20.840]  year ago when it was the iPad three and then the four, and these were
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:24.200]  the, when the iPad, when the retina iPad still had the full bezel around
[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:25.640]  the whole size, it doesn't matter.
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:29.960]  They were the same weight, the three and the four versus the first
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:32.280]  generation iPad mini.
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:36.520]  It was like, wow, this one has, it's a lot faster and has a beautiful
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:40.520]  retina to screen, but man, it's so much heavier than the mini, which
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:45.080]  doesn't have a retina screen and it's using your old, you know, system
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.560]  on a chip, but man, is it light.
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:52.040]  And it just seemed like a real easy, easier decision.
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:55.240]  Do you want to go lightweight and easier to carry around or do you want
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:58.360]  to go beautiful screen a little bit heavier?
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:02.360]  Whereas this year with the air, it was so much lighter.
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:06.520]  Like everybody who was at the original press event, you know, last
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:10.120]  October for the iPad, everybody was like, geez, I don't know how to
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:13.720]  decide which one of these to get now because the air is so much lighter.
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:17.000]  It's the whole reason I wanted a mini in the first place was it was
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.360]  easy to hold in one hand, but this is easy to hold in one hand because
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:23.960]  it was so much lighter than what it came before the surface pro is not
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:24.440]  like that.
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:25.880]  The surface pro is over a pound.
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:31.400]  So it's, it's, you know, it's not heavy, it's not, right.
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:33.080]  It's not, and that's fine.
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:37.320]  I mean, it's, you know, I guess it's thinner than a laptop, uh, and
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:41.160]  maybe a little lighter than one, but it's not the difference to me.
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:46.280]  The best example is still actually the MacBook air versus my old
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:50.920]  plastic MacBook, which was so heavy that I dreaded carrying it around.
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:55.080]  Whereas the, the minute I got the 13 inch MacBook air, it was the
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:58.360]  first computer I'd ever owned that I'm happy just to take anywhere.
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:01.480]  It never is annoying to carry it around.
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:04.680]  Uh, and there were other benefits too, like the battery life and that
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:08.680]  kind of stuff, but this, so the surface is not like that.
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:14.360]  Um, and I don't know, I, again, I should use it more and I'm not a
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:15.000]  windows guy.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.880]  So the OS is kind of foreign to me still.
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:23.800]  Uh, although I did, uh, pop open Twitter and internet Explorer side
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:25.960]  by side, and that was actually pretty cool.
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:30.280]  Like I would totally, so how does, how, what is the interface for, for
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:34.680]  putting two apps side by side instead of taking over the full screen?
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:36.920]  I'm sure there is a way to do it.
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:38.520]  That is the actual way to do it.
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:42.280]  But in my case, it was poke around until it happened by accident.
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:47.160]  Um, it's some secret gesture, like swiping in from one of the sides or
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:50.680]  something like that, which again, I'm sure there's, there's an actual
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:51.400]  right way to do it.
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.160]  I just haven't figured that out yet.
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:57.160]  So that's my, and you asked like, and I wrote about this this week is
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:59.160]  that, you know, I'm not opposed to it.
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:02.600]  And there, you know, it's, there's, I got some pushback, but like I wrote
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:05.960]  something, I was like to put it in, you know, Ramsey in terms, Michael,
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:07.880]  to steal Michael Lops, Twitter shtick.
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:13.960]  You say I want to run two apps side by side on my iPad.
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:18.680]  And I hear, I want the iPad to become more complicated.
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:19.880]  Right.
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:22.600]  And that doesn't mean that I think that they shouldn't do it or that
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:23.720]  they're not going to do it.
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:28.520]  But all I want to shine a light on is that if they do it, no matter how
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:32.760]  clever it is, it will therefore make the iPad more complicated than it
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:33.800]  was before.
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:34.920]  Maybe justly.
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:36.920]  So maybe it's a good decision.
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:40.520]  You know, when, when, when the iPhone couldn't copy and paste, when you
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:46.600]  couldn't select text and copy and paste, um, adding that made the iPhone
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:47.480]  more complicated.
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:52.920]  And I think everybody would agree, uh, it was complication for the
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:53.640]  better.
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:56.760]  Yes, it's more complicated, but it's better now because it's just so
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:57.560]  essential.
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:00.360]  Maybe Apple will come up with something for side by side apps that
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:03.480]  we'll look at the same way and it'll work for everybody.
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:07.640]  But to me, I think about it as a UI designer and I can't think of
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:14.680]  anything that really is, uh, approachable that most people would use
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:14.840]  it.
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:18.760]  To me, the only things I can think of are something where you double tap
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:24.680]  the home button to go into the multitasking thing and then drag, drag
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:29.000]  those little window versions that you see in the multitasking, somehow
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.440]  drag two of them together.
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:33.080]  And I just thought of that too independently.
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:34.600]  So maybe we're onto something there.
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:38.440]  Um, yeah, but I would, I'm going to go out in a limb and say, it's only
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:42.040]  going to work for apps that explicitly support it because it's a new half
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:46.280]  of the screen is going to be a new pixel resolution app that you ran a
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:47.080]  long time ago.
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:48.760]  The other one that you want on there, right?
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:50.200]  And it's not updating it.
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:50.440]  Right.
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:51.480]  How are they going to tell you?
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:56.440]  How are they going to suggest to you that this app is, you can select it?
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:57.080]  Ah, yeah.
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:57.880]  You know, I don't know.
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:59.400]  Turn the other ones black and white.
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:00.120]  I don't know.
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:00.840]  Have them bounce.
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:04.600]  I don't, I it's, it's a complicated, a complex question.
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:05.640]  UI design wise.
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:10.120]  I mean, it's kind of like how you join phone calls that are in session.
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:14.840]  Yeah, either put one on hold, start another one and then join the two of
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:19.560]  those, or you can put one on hold and create a new one and then join them.
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:23.320]  But it's, it's not that simple because that's just kind of running
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:24.680]  audio running in the background.
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:29.160]  Whereas this is, if it takes three or four taps to get two of them together,
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:32.440]  you don't want to have it completely undone by just hitting the home button
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:34.200]  once to do something else.
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:35.400]  Right.
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:38.600]  If you've set this up and it's taken three or four taps and you've got your
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:43.560]  Twitter client running next to Safari and, Oh, I got it.
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:46.760]  Just like my ideal, like living room setup.
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:47.000]  Right.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.600]  But I quick want to check my email because there's a thing I want to copy
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:53.160]  and paste from the email to put into the Safari.
[01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:54.440]  And then you hit the home button.
[01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:57.000]  You don't want to have to rebuild that Twitter thing.
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.160]  You want to be able to somehow go back to it.
[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:02.680]  And I don't know what that is because the only thing you can go back to in iOS
[01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:04.200]  as we know it is an app.
[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:05.480]  Right.
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:09.640]  And then on the surface, if I recall correctly, the way that that works is
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:14.280]  that it basically starts a third window and you can then decide where that
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:15.560]  third window goes.
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:17.400]  If anywhere, I don't have it in front of me.
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:20.760]  So maybe that's a false memory, but that's what it seemed like.
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:25.240]  So, you know, I know Mark Gurman said they're working on it, although he did
[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:27.400]  not say that they're doing it for sure.
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:31.160]  It seems to me like he doesn't even have that much stuff this year in terms of
[01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:32.040]  what's for sure.
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:33.640]  Other than like the health book thing.
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:35.000]  Yeah.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.040]  So I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:37.400]  I wouldn't like to bet on that.
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:39.960]  I wouldn't bet on seeing that next week.
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:40.600]  Right.
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:40.840]  Yeah.
[01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:43.480]  I mean, I would like it if it were elegant.
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:52.040]  You know, the Twitter on the iPad is, you know, the same with column that it
[01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:55.160]  should be on a phone and then it's taking up the rest of the screen.
[01:30:55.160 --> 01:31:01.080]  So it'd be really cool to have Twitter as like a side bar while I'm, you know,
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:04.920]  whatever using Safari or email or anything like that.
[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:09.720]  But as you say, they'll have to do it in a way that is elegant and makes sense.
[01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:13.000]  Otherwise they're messing with their clean OS.
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:17.320]  Other thing that they would be messing with, and Gurman acknowledged this in
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:19.480]  his report where he's like, I don't even, I don't know.
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:23.320]  And there's no word on whether it would be for the full size iPad air only or
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:24.760]  for the iPad mini too.
[01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:29.480]  But the thing is, is just in terms of the physical, just physical size, half of
[01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:31.960]  the iPad mini screen is not a lot of screen.
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:33.400]  Yeah.
[01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:36.680]  But in terms of pixels, it's the same as an air, isn't it?
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:38.680]  Well, I don't know.
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:38.920]  Yeah.
[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:39.080]  Yeah.
[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:42.440]  In terms of pixels, it's the same, but now you're talking about a lot of very
[01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:43.800]  small physical space.
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:47.880]  And yet to date, the OS is exactly the same.
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:50.280]  Pixel for pixel is exactly the same between the two.
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:53.480]  There's nothing you can do on the one on the air that you can't do on the other
[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:54.520]  just because it's bigger.
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:57.720]  Everything is pixel for pixel the same, but I can't help but think that if
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:01.400]  you're going to split it in half, it may not work out as well.
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:02.520]  Yeah.
[01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:06.040]  That would be an interesting thing to do some, some mock-ups of, I mean, and that
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:10.840]  was the most compelling thing to me about that surface is, wow, this is what a 12
[01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:12.360]  inch touch screen feels like.
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.400]  This is kind of cool.
[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:18.600]  Like I could see a big iPad, but, and that was kind of the angle of my piece
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:21.880]  about this was, Hey, I could actually see a big iPad being useful.
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:27.240]  Like my, you know, my kind of dream setup now would be a big iPad that I don't
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:28.280]  really take places.
[01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:31.880]  And then a big iPhone that kind of replaces my small iPad.
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:37.960]  But I don't, you know, now I'm just fantasy designing Apple hardware, which
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:43.400]  is not something that I'm probably supposed to be doing, but, but I'm excited
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:43.960]  for it though.
[01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:48.200]  I mean, just in terms of, if it does come out, I, I can't help but think that
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:51.320]  the only, if it is going to come out, that they've got something really
[01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:54.840]  thoughtfully designed because I don't think they're under any market pressure
[01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:55.720]  to do it.
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:55.960]  No.
[01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:56.360]  Right.
[01:32:56.360 --> 01:33:02.680]  So, so Microsoft has been banging the drum for this sort of, uh, not technical
[01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:07.480]  multitasking, not computer science to two processes running on the same
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:11.640]  operating system at the same time, but visual multitasking, two things on
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:18.440]  screen at the same time, Twitter and a YouTube video, or, you know, your email
[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:21.160]  and a web browser on screen at the same time.
[01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:25.160]  You know, for, for my work, uh, a web browser and Excel or something like
[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:29.480]  that, so I could get data and, and spreadsheet it at the same time.
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:30.440]  It certainly hasn't.
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:34.840]  Microsoft having gotten to it first two years ago, I guess, or a year and a
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:38.600]  half ago, hasn't really helped them make a dent, put a dent in the tablet
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:39.000]  market.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:44.040]  So it's not like Apple's under, under, um, market pressure to do so in the
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:48.680]  same way that they seem to be under market pressure to come out with a
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:49.480]  bigger iPhone.
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:50.280]  Right.
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:55.080]  And you know that there are people who are buying other brand phones
[01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:56.840]  because they want a bigger phone.
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:00.600]  You know, how big of that market, how, you know, how many people there are
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:06.200]  you could argue about, but you inarguable that it's a number worth caring
[01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:06.520]  about.
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:07.720]  Totally.
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:10.680]  Whereas I don't see that for this multitasking on tablets.
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:14.120]  To me, they're not going to do it unless they have something clever.
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:17.080]  So I'm excited because if they show it, I feel like we're going to see
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:18.920]  something pretty, pretty interesting.
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:20.920]  Yeah, I hope so.
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:24.680]  Uh, and one of the things I was thinking about then is, and as you
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:30.040]  mentioned, they just, Microsoft has not caught any traction with, with
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:31.880]  tablets or phones.
[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:37.400]  Um, I wonder if they should make a laptop or is that too competitive
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:39.800]  with all their partners?
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:43.080]  I don't know how is it to me, they've already broken the seal.
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:44.760]  I think they kind of have, haven't they?
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:48.120]  But see, here's the thing I think though, and this is what I took away
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:53.560]  from the coverage last week and your piece in particular is that to me, it
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:57.080]  seems like what they were saying at last week's event is that they think
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:59.560]  this is the future of the laptop, right?
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:04.920]  A tablet that attached, you know, uh, you know, the screen part is a tablet
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:07.000]  and the keyboard part to detaches.
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:08.200]  Yeah.
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:09.000]  And it's a cover.
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:14.760]  And to me, that's why they kept bringing up the Mac book air or not Mac.
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:15.000]  Yeah.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.800]  Mac book air, not the iPad that they weren't talking about iPads.
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:18.120]  Really.
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:20.440]  They were talking about the Mac book air that they're saying if you want
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:23.400]  to do work, this is the form factor.
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:27.160]  You know, and like the way I put it is that they're saying this tablet
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:32.120]  form factor isn't just for iOS type devices, media simplified.
[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:35.720]  Well, and not just media stuff, but simplified one thing at a time.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.840]  A simple system that anybody can kind of get the gist of, you know, you,
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:43.720]  you tap an app, you're in the app, you tap home, you go back to your
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:44.680]  apps and that's it.
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:50.600]  They're saying this form factor is useful for more complicated systems
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:53.080]  like windows or, you know, in theory.
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:56.760]  Now Microsoft isn't saying it, but in theory that they're there by
[01:35:56.760 --> 01:36:00.760]  implication, they're saying that Apple is wrong.
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:04.760]  Not to be doing a Mac OS device in this form factor.
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:05.160]  Yeah.
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:06.920]  And that this is your next laptop.
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:08.920]  It's this tablet, right?
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:14.280]  That Apple Apple's stance is that the form factors are tied to the
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:19.800]  complexities of the systems that the simple tablet form factor is meant
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:25.960]  for the simple iOS interface and that the more complicated MacBook form
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:30.040]  factor with the attached keyboard and a track pad and this layer of
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:33.960]  abstraction between the track pad and the pointer on the screen is
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:37.080]  inherently suited to the more complex OS Mac OS.
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:38.600]  Yeah.
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:41.720]  And Microsoft is saying that, you know, that to me is what I took away
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:44.520]  from it is they're saying, no, this form factor is the future of
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:48.120]  portable computing for any level of complexity.
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:48.520]  Yeah.
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:51.560]  And then, well, the trick, the trouble I had with that was that the
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:55.720]  minute they got into anything rather complicated, immediately the
[01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:57.800]  stylus came out and the keyboard.
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:04.120]  So, uh, is that better, you know, than a, just a keyboard that's, and
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:08.280]  not a touch screen, I suppose for some applications it is like, you
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:11.800]  know, you link to the people drawing on it and that kind of stuff.
[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:12.040]  Yeah.
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:17.400]  Um, I don't, you know, I don't know if that's better than a, than a
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:22.120]  purpose designed drawing tablet, like one of the Wacom, Wacom, whatever
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:22.840]  they're called.
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:23.080]  Yeah.
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:25.880]  Long-term though, what I I've always thought about with that and that,
[01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:27.960]  yeah, Wacom and I forget who else.
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:31.000]  And you know, apparently the, the, the surface is really good for this.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  Uh, I think he's Gabe, the penny arcade guy, who's the artist, uh, who's
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.040]  been using one for a while.
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:39.000]  And he has, you know, had the, got the surface pro three right away and
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:44.200]  says, it's really good, um, for precision drawing in a way that the
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:47.640]  iPad screens are not precise like that.
[01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:51.640]  Um, but there's nothing that stops Apple from eventually making an iPad
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:54.600]  that has a screen that that's, that is that precise.
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:58.680]  And I don't think they'll ever ship with a stylist, but they could make
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:03.080]  one that you could get a third party stylist that would have professional
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:03.960]  level precision.
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:04.920]  Yeah.
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:10.760]  I actually bought a Kickstarter stylist that was the most precise, like
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:12.600]  iPad stylists I've seen so far.
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:16.200]  Uh, very small tip and it's, it's all right, but I just don't really have
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:16.680]  any use for it.
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:20.600]  So I don't, I never use it, but, um, syntax, syntax.
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:21.480]  Is that the other one?
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:24.920]  It's like, uh, I think the Pixar people remember.
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:25.800]  Oh, cool.
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:27.000]  Yeah.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.080]  So that's what, I dunno, I, I'm not sold on, on that.
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:37.880]  I'm not sold and I'm sure there, my guess is that this will be the most
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:43.960]  successful tablet PC ever made, because that's basically saying that more
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:46.040]  than 20 people will buy it.
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:53.240]  But I, you know, when I think about writing a lot or, you know, building a
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:39:00.520]  document in a spreadsheet program or doing graphic manipulation, I'm still
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:07.960]  much happier with a keyboard and a real track pad, uh, than, than what they're
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:08.440]  shipping.
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:12.600]  Uh, that's not to say that they can't keep improving it, but it just like that,
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:19.320]  that keyboard still feels like a cheapo add-on keyboard relative to the real
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:23.320]  rigid kind of bottom half of a, of a good laptop.
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:27.000]  Let me, let me just stop right here and cut off all the people who are probably
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.600]  already halfway through emailing me.
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:37.880]  Syntiq C I N T I Q is, it's a line of, uh, touch screen tablets from Wacom.
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:39.320]  Oh, cool.
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:43.080]  So that's, that, that's, that's what I was thinking of, but that's why you
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:46.520]  thought Wacom it's Wacom's line of touch screen tablets.
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:48.760]  Do you think they would do that?
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:55.160]  Apple would do a touch screen Mac OS device, whether it's a Mac book with
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:40:00.200]  touch. Yeah, I really think no.
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:06.120]  I think we're, I think we're more likely to see a laptop iOS device than a
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:07.000]  touch screen Mac.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:07.880]  Huh?
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:08.520]  Interesting.
[01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:09.880]  I just, you know what though?
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:14.680]  Well, I don't think that they'll announce the hardware next week, but that's
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:20.040]  something to keep an eye on when they show us Mac OS 10.10 is look at what
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:21.800]  out of the chips.
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:25.400]  Well, no, look at how big the screen, the elements are on screen.
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:29.720]  Are they spaced in such a way that they look like they're amenable to big,
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:30.520]  fat fingers.
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:32.360]  Ah, interesting.
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:36.840]  Yeah, because Mac OS as we know it is totally, totally horrible for fingers.
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:41.800]  Like just the simplest thing, like the red, yellow, green buttons in the
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:44.280]  windows for closing.
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:45.000]  Not going to happen.
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:46.760]  Well, they're so close to each other.
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:50.040]  You'd never, nothing on iOS is ever that close to each other because you're,
[01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:50.840]  they're all right next to you.
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:54.760]  I mean, I'm looking at a Safari window right now and the close button, the
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:59.480]  minimize button and the back button are all, you know, within all of those
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:02.360]  three buttons are all within the target area of one button.
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:05.000]  That's the size of my fingertip, right?
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:05.240]  Yeah.
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:09.400]  And the, and the menu, uh, the little icons in the menu bar, um, you know,
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:13.480]  with the sound and the wifi and that kind of stuff, none of that would
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:14.680]  really be right.
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:15.720]  And combine it.
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:15.960]  Yeah.
[01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:20.440]  Combine it with the file menu, like the top window in Safari on my Mac right
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:24.280]  now, the close button is right under the file menu.
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:28.920]  So there's actually three touch targets, four touch targets that are all
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:33.000]  within, you know, the, with drastically different consequences, right?
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:33.560]  Right.
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:36.200]  Open a new, Oh, I didn't mean to close that whole app.
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:36.600]  Yeah.
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:37.000]  Right.
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  It's, it would be a recipe in frustration if they just turned on touch,
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.760]  they'd have to resize everything.
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:46.040]  And, you know, it just, it would just be, you know, I'm not saying it's
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:49.240]  impossible, but it's, you know, you'll be able to tell just by looking at
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:52.920]  iOS eight, if it's designed with future touch and in mind.
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:53.880]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:42:00.280]  And if they were to ever converge them into one, you know, whether it's
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:04.680]  fully, you know, the same operating system or at least the same look and
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:08.760]  feel, that's where we would start to see the cues there.
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:13.640]  Um, I thought you were going to say, look and see if it'll run on, um,
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:17.240]  non Intel arm chips, but they're not going to, yeah.
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:18.280]  They're not going to mention that.
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:22.760]  So I, I will eat my hat if they don't have a version of Mac OS 10 running
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:27.000]  on arm chips in the same, probably in the same freaking lab, that's how,
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:32.280]  that's how Tim Cook's Mac book air lasts all the way to, uh, to Taiwan or
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:32.760]  whatever.
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:33.080]  Right.
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:36.120]  They'd be nuts not to have it compile, especially now.
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:36.680]  I bet.
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:38.040]  And maybe they couldn't do it.
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:40.440]  In fact, I was thinking about it.
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:46.120]  Maybe they couldn't do it until the arm went 64 bit with the last year's
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:50.600]  devices because Mac OS 10 had already gone 64 bit and there was no way they
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:55.560]  could keep 64 bit Mac OS 10 running on 32 bit arm chips.
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:58.680]  But now that they have 64 bit arm chips, if they don't already have it
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:01.960]  running there, they're full steam ahead, making it running it's on.
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:06.760]  But we won't know that because in the same way that we never knew that iOS
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:12.280]  seven was going to be 64 bit until they shipped those devices until they
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:16.200]  announced the iPhone five S because the versions, the betas they shipped
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:20.360]  starting at WWDC last year and all summer long, they just shipped 32 bit
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:21.080]  betas.
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:23.800]  And they never, you know, nor did we know that there would be an Intel
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:28.360]  version of Mac OS versus the old, uh, power PC chips.
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:28.520]  Right.
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:31.880]  Cause they just never distributed outside their internal lab.
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:35.800]  Hey, so speaking, I mentioned before about the fact that everything's mostly
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:40.600]  ones and zeros, but I do have a physical thing to announce, which is live
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:41.640]  version of the talk show.
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:43.160]  I said this in the last episode.
[01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:44.120]  Whoa.
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:46.120]  I would have ticket information I've done.
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:48.280]  Oh, okay.
[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:51.880]  I thought this show was live and then we had an audience.
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.040]  No, I would never do that.
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:54.600]  Oh, cool.
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:57.080]  You launched a new podcasting suite.
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:57.560]  Nice man.
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:04.760]  No, it's a live event next week in San Francisco, uh, Tuesday, six to nine PM
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:10.040]  at mezzanine, which is right there on, uh, uh, what's it mint square or
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:11.560]  whatever the hell it's called?
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:11.960]  I don't know.
[01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:14.360]  Well, the address will be on the website.
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:15.320]  Here is where you go.
[01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:17.320]  This is the announcement for ticket information.
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:22.600]  Uh, selling the tickets on a new system from my friend, uh, Paul Campbell,
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:24.440]  the guy behind the wool conference Tito.
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:33.320]  So you go to ti.to super short domain name, ti.to slash daring fireball.
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:36.280]  And, uh, right now, as soon as, if you're listening to this, you can go
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:40.440]  and you'll see a link to the talk show live from WWDC.
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:44.200]  Um, and you can buy tickets, give me a limited space.
[01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:46.360]  We sold out pretty quickly last year.
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:47.560]  Same, same facility.
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:52.520]  Uh, I think we'll have at least 350 tickets.
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:55.160]  Maybe, maybe more, but probably 350 to start.
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:59.480]  Uh, so if you're hearing this now, uh, you should go and check it out.
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:02.680]  If you want to come and anybody can go, you don't have to be a WWDC attendee.
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:05.400]  I think most people this year aren't aren't, don't have badges.
[01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:06.520]  Yeah.
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:10.040]  Do you, uh, it's complicated.
[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:13.400]  I don't ask.
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:19.000]  I have been told that I will have a press badge for the keynote and I don't have a
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.920]  paid, uh, the attendee badge though.
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:21.240]  Okay.
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:22.120]  Got it.
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:23.400]  Um, but we'll see.
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:27.080]  I'm going to scalp some tickets to this thing now, cause it's going to sell out by the time
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:29.080]  anyone, are you going to be in San Francisco?
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:31.400]  Not, no, I'm actually going to be in Seattle that day.
[01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:33.720]  Uh, because quartz is having a conference there.
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:37.960]  Um, so Monday and Tuesday, uh, Monday.
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:41.560]  And then I'm actually spending Tuesday in Seattle and then coming back.
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:43.880]  I should have gone to San Francisco.
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:48.280]  Well, you're going to miss from Seattle, but I've been to the one, uh, that you did two
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:49.640]  years ago and it was super fun.
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:50.840]  It was really great.
[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:51.640]  Last year's was better.
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:52.760]  Yeah.
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:54.280]  Two years ago was cable Sasser.

[01:45:57.080 --> 01:45:58.680]  We're at the same place we were last year.

[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:04.680]  Really.
[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:05.880]  It's a really great place.

[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:19.080]  Um, although I think the bar sponsorship is still open.

[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:49.400]  It feels like a memorial day.
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:49.560]  Yeah.
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:50.920]  Happy Memorial day to you.
[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:51.880]  Uh, happy.
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:53.320]  Congratulations on the new gig.
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:55.400]  Always good to see you writing more.
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:56.280]  I'm excited.
[01:47:56.280 --> 01:48:00.760]  I've kind of have had a lot of thoughts in my head over the last six months that have
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:04.760]  been too kind of busy slash lazy to express.
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:06.040]  So now I have to do it.
[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:08.120]  And can I just say a big picture?
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:11.640]  I've been doing this for a while during fireball and even the talk show.
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:16.760]  I am more excited about what's going on and all this stuff that we talk about this year
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:19.880]  than I've been in a long time because I feel like, I don't know.
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:22.360]  I feel like there's a lot, a lot of turning points.
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:23.640]  I agree.
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:28.840]  I had last, the last, uh, I would say the second half of last year I was super bored.
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:35.400]  Like I just did not really, I was almost offended by kind of how little progress was going on,
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:41.000]  but I don't know what, maybe, maybe it's just, uh, the, the spring after a, an awful
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.320]  winter, but I'm really, I'm excited.
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:47.640]  I think there's a lot of, you know, and, and I hope I'm not disappointed by what ends
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:52.520]  up coming out of it, but I think that Apple in particular and other companies, Google
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:58.280]  and Microsoft and Amazon and even Facebook and Twitter are in a position to really do
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:48:59.400]  some cool stuff now.
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:02.200]  So I hope they hope they don't disappoint.
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:07.480]  I compare it to 2007 when the iPad or iPhone first came out and nobody, we knew it was
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:08.200]  awesome.
[01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:12.360]  It's a little different cause there's not one device that to me has sent centered our
[01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:17.320]  attention, but it was like, I just, we just didn't know where it was going to go.
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:20.360]  It was clearly going somewhere new, but we couldn't tell where.
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:27.240]  And I knew there was a phone coming, but we didn't know how drastically knew it was going
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:27.560]  to be.
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:30.680]  I feel that way with the interface stuff for Mac OS 10.
[01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:34.840]  I feel that way with the health monitoring stuff that everybody says is coming to iOS.
[01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:40.120]  So it's coming and it's feels like it's cool ideas, but I can't tell where it's going.
[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:44.040]  And so I feel like it's, it's a very exciting time to be writing about and talking about
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:44.520]  this stuff.
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:45.560]  Me too.
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:47.000]  Yeah.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:47.240]  All right.
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:48.040]  Well thank you Dan.
[01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:48.280]  Yeah.

[01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:50.040]  Qz.com.
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:55.160]  Qz and at from dome on Twitter where you can sound off and tell me I'm a moron.
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:55.400]  Right.
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:56.280]  What do we ask people?
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:57.640]  We want them to send us there.
[01:49:57.640 --> 01:49:59.080]  Oh, programming on.
[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:03.800]  If you have any ideas for new tips for early.
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:04.040]  Yeah.
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:08.200]  Like hypercard type stuff like CODIA and stuff like that, like ways that you can teach yourself
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:09.320]  programming on iOS.
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:10.360]  Awesome.
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:11.320]  Thank you everyone.
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:11.560]  Yeah.
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:12.840]  Thanks John.
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:20.920]  I'm hitting stop.
