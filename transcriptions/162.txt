[00:00.000 --> 00:03.280]  Every Mac user is the smugest bastard in the world.
[00:03.920 --> 00:05.520]  Viruses are never going to affect us.
[00:05.520 --> 00:06.640]  We're immune, whatever.
[00:06.640 --> 00:08.640]  And the reality, of course, is some people feel that way.
[00:09.200 --> 00:14.080]  Most people who've looked at the situation at all know that we're not immune.
[00:14.080 --> 00:14.960]  We're just really lucky.
[00:14.960 --> 00:16.560]  It's just the target's been small.
[00:16.560 --> 00:19.840]  Apple does a good job upgrading and pushing people to upgrade.
[00:19.840 --> 00:22.240]  They support systems back many years.
[00:22.240 --> 00:27.600]  The target is so small that it's usually not worthwhile for malware makers to target us.
[00:27.600 --> 00:32.560]  So that's been our immunity is because we're insignificant as a target, not necessarily
[00:32.560 --> 00:33.600]  in absolute numbers.
[00:33.600 --> 00:40.320]  So this new thing is this group at Cisco, Talos, or Talos, they are one of many security
[00:40.320 --> 00:44.000]  firms that's constantly researching for weaknesses, usually to help clients.
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.640]  They are trying to make sure their clients are protected.
[00:46.640 --> 00:47.600]  They find something.
[00:47.600 --> 00:54.640]  This fellow who I had some communication with, Tyler Bowen, found five previously undiscovered,
[00:54.640 --> 01:00.480]  fairly severe flaws in the way that image format files get parsed.
[01:01.360 --> 01:04.880]  And the trouble was like three or four of them were reasonably severe, but you had to
[01:04.880 --> 01:07.440]  kind of open a file and whatever, but there's one related to TIFF.
[01:07.440 --> 01:09.920]  John, you've been using TIFF for your whole life, right?
[01:09.920 --> 01:10.560]  Since you were born.
[01:10.560 --> 01:11.120]  That's right.
[01:11.120 --> 01:12.160]  That's right.
[01:12.160 --> 01:13.120]  Ancient format.
[01:13.120 --> 01:15.600]  So there's a part of the, something in the parser.
[01:15.600 --> 01:21.280]  If you use a tiled TIFF file and it's formatted in this very specific malicious fashion, the
[01:21.280 --> 01:26.400]  iOS and ostensibly OS 10, and probably, I think the other two OSes are also patched,
[01:26.400 --> 01:32.800]  tvOS and watchOS, if it's rendered, it will actually, I think in that case, it's a memory,
[01:32.800 --> 01:36.720]  it's a buffer overflow, usual typical old thing, and it can allow the potential for
[01:36.720 --> 01:40.960]  malicious code to execute and, you know, take control of the machine and do whatever.
[01:40.960 --> 01:42.800]  Just by displaying the image.
[01:42.800 --> 01:43.280]  Yeah.
[01:43.280 --> 01:45.600]  And here's the reason it's considered particularly insidious.
[01:45.600 --> 01:48.000]  You could load it with a webpage in Safari.
[01:48.000 --> 01:53.520]  You could have iMessages open and somebody could text, you know, send you a text message
[01:53.520 --> 01:54.320]  with a TIFF in it.
[01:54.320 --> 01:58.720]  There's a few other vectors merely by rendering the preview.
[01:58.720 --> 02:01.920]  It would have to parse the file enough that this condition could be exploited.
[02:02.480 --> 02:04.640]  That sounds pretty horrific, right?
[02:04.640 --> 02:10.640]  That's, and that's why it was considered, it's considered very severe at some discussion
[02:10.640 --> 02:15.040]  about how severe, in Apple's patch, they used responsible disclosure.
[02:15.040 --> 02:16.240]  It's not a zero day.
[02:16.240 --> 02:19.600]  It's not a zero day, there aren't exploits in the wild.
[02:19.600 --> 02:25.840]  And if you update to all the current OSs, if you just update to the latest micro release,
[02:25.840 --> 02:30.400]  you are protected against that particular TIFF exploit as well as the other four image
[02:30.400 --> 02:31.680]  format related exploits.
[02:32.240 --> 02:34.080]  I have so many follow-up points already.
[02:35.040 --> 02:39.280]  By the way, BMP format, BMP is actually also effective, which is kind of hilarious.
[02:39.280 --> 02:41.440]  Like TIFF and BMP, nobody's looking at them.
[02:41.440 --> 02:43.200]  And I think they're just old implementations.
[02:43.200 --> 02:46.160]  Let me see if I can keep them on my head.
[02:46.160 --> 02:51.440]  One of them is, yes, I used to use, as you know, and I know you have the ink-stained
[02:51.440 --> 02:54.400]  hands as well, I came from a world of print design.
[02:54.400 --> 03:01.760]  And in the world of print design in the 90s, TIFF was the de facto format, at least for
[03:01.760 --> 03:05.120]  line art, for any kind of bitmap.
[03:05.920 --> 03:10.400]  Everything went from through Photoshop into TIFF before it went into production.
[03:10.400 --> 03:14.960]  But it's sort of a notorious file format, because I seem to recall vaguely that over
[03:14.960 --> 03:21.920]  the years, there have been an awful lot of security issues like this that have to do
[03:21.920 --> 03:23.120]  with TIFF parsing.
[03:23.120 --> 03:24.720]  That is my reflection as well.
[03:24.720 --> 03:27.680]  I didn't go back and look it up, but I think it's that old code thing.
[03:27.680 --> 03:33.440]  Like, people wrote TIFF parsers in 1980-something, no, sorry, early 1990s, or late 1980s, maybe,
[03:33.440 --> 03:34.800]  probably late 1980s.
[03:34.800 --> 03:39.360]  And the parsers, the basic code is probably mostly unchanged in a lot of ways for the
[03:39.360 --> 03:40.560]  30 years.
[03:40.560 --> 03:42.640]  And it's probably a very difficult format.
[03:42.640 --> 03:45.600]  It's probably a poor format spec, that's my guess.
[03:45.600 --> 03:51.520]  That therefore, it makes it hard to write the easy to write, not easy to write, hard
[03:51.520 --> 03:58.000]  to write a parser, and easy to make mistakes with memory management in the handling of
[03:58.000 --> 03:58.480]  the parser.
[03:58.480 --> 04:00.320]  So anyway, here's another point.
[04:00.320 --> 04:05.600]  Because it's such a weird old format, and it was never really part of the web in any
[04:05.600 --> 04:12.480]  way, I'm very surprised that iOS and watchOS even have TIFF parsing code.
[04:12.480 --> 04:13.440]  I know.
[04:13.440 --> 04:14.480]  I am.
[04:14.480 --> 04:16.720]  This is part of the quick look thing, though.
[04:16.720 --> 04:23.600]  Everything in all the different OSes support quick look for every major file type and includes
[04:23.600 --> 04:27.840]  some weird image formats and other things that you might never be previewing.
[04:27.840 --> 04:33.680]  But you can preview raw images in some cases, PNGs, are they DNG files, one of the digital
[04:33.680 --> 04:35.920]  formats, all these things.
[04:35.920 --> 04:40.560]  PNG, by the way, when that specification, portable network graphics, that's kind of
[04:40.560 --> 04:44.800]  TIFF's replacement, because it has all the different kinds of things need lossless and
[04:44.800 --> 04:46.880]  lossy and different alpha, whatever.
[04:46.880 --> 04:51.520]  In the specifications, I met one of the people who wrote the spec years ago, 1990s.
[04:51.520 --> 04:54.320]  It says ping is pronounced ping in the spec.
[04:54.320 --> 04:55.200]  So there's no question.
[04:59.200 --> 05:00.320]  How else could you pronounce it?
[05:00.320 --> 05:01.280]  PNG, I guess.
[05:01.280 --> 05:02.560]  I don't know.
[05:02.560 --> 05:03.440]  The only other way.
[05:03.440 --> 05:07.760]  Yeah, the only other way I could think you could pronounce it would be just saying the
[05:07.760 --> 05:08.960]  initials PNG.
[05:08.960 --> 05:10.320]  I pronounce it pang.
[05:10.320 --> 05:10.720]  I don't know.
[05:11.280 --> 05:13.040]  You know someone would find a way.
[05:13.040 --> 05:22.000]  Ping is an odd historical success, because a lot of times when people get together in
[05:22.000 --> 05:27.440]  the open and say, you know, there's even like an XKCD comic about it where it's like, we
[05:27.440 --> 05:29.520]  have way too many specs and they all stink.
[05:29.520 --> 05:30.880]  You know what the solution is?
[05:30.880 --> 05:31.680]  A new spec.
[05:33.440 --> 05:36.800]  You just add to the pile, usually, even if it's a noble goal.
[05:36.800 --> 05:43.760]  Whereas ping had the noble goal of saying, we've got a couple of bitmap image files,
[05:43.760 --> 05:48.160]  formats that are out there being used, and they are all terrible for certain for one
[05:48.160 --> 05:49.280]  reason or another.
[05:49.280 --> 05:49.520]  Yeah.
[05:49.520 --> 05:50.880]  Web, we had GIF files.
[05:50.880 --> 05:53.040]  And don't even tell me that you're a GIF person.
[05:53.040 --> 05:53.760]  Oh, my God.
[05:53.760 --> 05:54.880]  Are you a GIF person?
[05:55.440 --> 05:56.960]  I'm choosy programmers.
[05:56.960 --> 05:57.680]  Choose Jeff.
[05:57.680 --> 05:58.480]  That's the GIF.
[05:58.480 --> 06:01.520]  It's a graphic image change interchange format.
[06:03.520 --> 06:04.800]  Anyway, it's a GIF file.
[06:07.520 --> 06:08.000]  Terrible.
[06:08.000 --> 06:11.360]  Just I mean, a horrendous format.
[06:11.360 --> 06:13.440]  I mean, you can only have 256 colors at a time.
[06:13.440 --> 06:14.800]  I mean, it's goofy.
[06:16.400 --> 06:17.360]  It was great.
[06:17.360 --> 06:18.960]  It was great for CompuServe.
[06:18.960 --> 06:19.680]  It's juju.
[06:20.240 --> 06:23.680]  It was great for CompuServe because I was a CompuServe user.
[06:23.680 --> 06:24.000]  Were you?
[06:24.000 --> 06:24.480]  I can't remember.
[06:24.480 --> 06:25.040]  Were you?
[06:25.040 --> 06:26.720]  No, I was never on CompuServe.
[06:26.720 --> 06:27.840]  Okay, no, I can't.
[06:27.840 --> 06:30.800]  For a long time, I can remember my five comma four digit
[06:31.360 --> 06:31.840]  address.
[06:31.840 --> 06:32.640]  It begins with seven.
[06:32.640 --> 06:33.360]  I've totally lost.
[06:33.360 --> 06:34.560]  That's one of the problems with aging.
[06:34.560 --> 06:37.600]  I cannot remember my 1979 CompuServe login.
[06:37.600 --> 06:38.560]  It makes me sad.
[06:38.560 --> 06:40.080]  But on CompuServe, it was great.
[06:40.080 --> 06:40.720]  It was dial-up.
[06:40.720 --> 06:44.000]  We had like, I don't know, 1,200 baud modems or 1,200
[06:44.000 --> 06:45.600]  BPS modems, something like that.
[06:45.600 --> 06:48.000]  It was a great compact format when you had, and it was
[06:49.200 --> 06:52.000]  rendered in a way that made sense, like line at a time
[06:52.000 --> 06:53.920]  or interlacing was, you know, all these things.
[06:53.920 --> 06:58.400]  Most computers only had 16 color displays.
[06:58.400 --> 07:00.240]  So yeah, it was perfect for the day.
[07:00.240 --> 07:03.360]  And it's astonishing that it still is great.
[07:03.360 --> 07:06.080]  But yeah, Ping, and you remember the most boring thing
[07:06.080 --> 07:06.800]  in the world.
[07:06.800 --> 07:10.720]  This LZW algorithm was patented and Unisys tried to
[07:10.720 --> 07:14.080]  enforce it and Ping is an outcome of efforts to patent.
[07:14.080 --> 07:17.120]  The patent expired in, I had to look it up, 2003, because
[07:17.120 --> 07:18.080]  I remember it had gone off.
[07:18.720 --> 07:19.840]  But that was part of the issue.
[07:19.840 --> 07:22.320]  Like TIFF used LZW, which meant how to be licensed.
[07:22.320 --> 07:25.600]  GIF was being attacked, or potentially Unisys wanted to
[07:25.600 --> 07:26.640]  license it.
[07:26.640 --> 07:29.920]  I believe LZW may have been one of the early attempts to,
[07:29.920 --> 07:31.760]  one of the issues like business, not business method
[07:31.760 --> 07:34.640]  patents, but it was a software-ish patent, algorithm
[07:34.640 --> 07:35.040]  patents.
[07:35.040 --> 07:36.000]  There were some issues there.
[07:36.000 --> 07:37.520]  Anyway, Ping came out of that.
[07:37.520 --> 07:39.600]  And historically, we're getting sidetracked here, but it's
[07:39.600 --> 07:40.240]  all good stuff.
[07:40.240 --> 07:40.720]  No.
[07:42.320 --> 07:45.760]  It was a big story locally, because Unisys is a
[07:45.760 --> 07:47.600]  Philadelphia area company, or at least they were.
[07:47.600 --> 07:49.040]  I don't know if they still are.
[07:49.040 --> 07:50.560]  So it was a big story locally.
[07:50.560 --> 07:53.840]  But the gist of it is that they owned the patents behind,
[07:53.840 --> 07:59.680]  or patents that were a fundamental part of the GIF format.
[08:01.680 --> 08:02.480]  Son of a bitch.
[08:05.040 --> 08:06.720]  And they never enforced it.
[08:06.720 --> 08:14.320]  And there were GIFs being displayed and parsed and created
[08:14.320 --> 08:16.800]  on every image editing tool.
[08:16.800 --> 08:17.920]  And it was all over the place.
[08:17.920 --> 08:21.840]  And then Netscape added, put support in to render them in
[08:23.840 --> 08:27.680]  Mosaic or whatever the first one of their browsers that
[08:27.680 --> 08:29.600]  had images, which was a big deal.
[08:30.400 --> 08:33.680]  It was actually a big deal when they added image tags to
[08:33.680 --> 08:34.640]  the web browser.
[08:34.640 --> 08:35.440]  Oh, my god.
[08:37.840 --> 08:41.120]  And they waited until all of a sudden, when the internet
[08:41.120 --> 08:46.560]  exploded, and everybody was buying like Adam Eng's stuff,
[08:46.560 --> 08:48.880]  like Adam Eng's internet book.
[08:48.880 --> 08:50.720]  And everybody is like, I'm going to get on the internet.
[08:50.720 --> 08:53.120]  And Bill Gates is writing a memo that we're going to turn
[08:53.120 --> 08:56.080]  the whole Microsoft around at the internet, internet,
[08:56.080 --> 08:56.560]  internet.
[08:57.120 --> 08:59.280]  And then all of a sudden, somebody at Unisys was like,
[08:59.280 --> 09:00.480]  hey, we own a patent for this.
[09:02.560 --> 09:06.480]  And the open community responded and said, we've got to
[09:06.480 --> 09:07.440]  create a new format.
[09:07.440 --> 09:08.080]  And they did it.
[09:08.080 --> 09:09.600]  They did it quickly.
[09:09.600 --> 09:12.560]  They got support into all the tools quickly.
[09:12.560 --> 09:17.760]  And Ping took over the world as it was supposed to very
[09:17.760 --> 09:18.240]  quickly.
[09:18.240 --> 09:19.520]  And that almost never happened.
[09:20.400 --> 09:22.240]  And Ping is such a great format in a lot of ways.
[09:22.240 --> 09:24.720]  I mean, I think it's funny that it didn't actually ultimately
[09:24.720 --> 09:28.160]  replace everything except JPEG.
[09:28.160 --> 09:29.760]  But it's great.
[09:29.760 --> 09:30.880]  There's all the different kinds.
[09:30.880 --> 09:31.600]  There's two modes.
[09:31.600 --> 09:34.720]  You can do 24-bit with alpha transparency.
[09:34.720 --> 09:39.760]  And it's just not quite as compact, I think, as GIF for the
[09:39.760 --> 09:41.200]  same thing.
[09:41.200 --> 09:43.040]  But yeah, patents.
[09:43.040 --> 09:44.800]  Patents are issues.
[09:44.800 --> 09:48.080]  It almost came up, you remember, with the committee
[09:48.080 --> 09:51.360]  that runs the, what is it, H.264, whatever the underlying
[09:51.360 --> 09:52.320]  patents are there.
[09:52.320 --> 09:53.600]  There's a patent pool.
[09:53.600 --> 09:55.520]  But I think there was, at one point, there was a question
[09:55.520 --> 10:00.560]  about whether if you used, if you displayed H.264 video on
[10:00.560 --> 10:03.680]  your site without going through a third-party package like
[10:03.680 --> 10:07.200]  Adobe Flash, for instance, which wraps it, that you might
[10:07.200 --> 10:09.120]  actually owe separate licensing fees.
[10:09.120 --> 10:12.160]  And using Flash, one of the reasons that Flash was
[10:12.160 --> 10:16.320]  successful is because Adobe handled the licensing for
[10:16.320 --> 10:18.240]  video patents, or at least they said they did.
[10:18.240 --> 10:20.880]  I think that fact was overlooked because, you know,
[10:20.880 --> 10:22.240]  Flash is so terrible.
[10:22.240 --> 10:24.960]  But it meant there was no, if you were a, you know, CBS or
[10:24.960 --> 10:27.360]  something, if you put it in Flash, your lawyers must have
[10:27.360 --> 10:28.560]  assured you it's cool.
[10:28.560 --> 10:29.360]  We don't have any fees.
[10:30.080 --> 10:34.160]  If you'd used HTML5, as if it existed, to show, you know, to
[10:34.160 --> 10:37.920]  directly stream that kind of format, I think there might
[10:37.920 --> 10:38.640]  have been a patent issue.
[10:38.640 --> 10:39.680]  And that's been resolved since.
[10:39.680 --> 10:41.920]  The patent holders changed it so they wouldn't, you know,
[10:41.920 --> 10:42.560]  poop in the pool.
[10:42.560 --> 10:43.760]  I seem to remember that.
[10:43.760 --> 10:46.240]  You know, it's always a good sign when the lawyers are
[10:46.240 --> 10:51.440]  making engineering decisions for your web technologies.
[10:51.440 --> 10:52.000]  It's great.
[10:52.000 --> 10:52.720]  I like that.
[10:52.720 --> 10:53.600]  No one could go wrong.
[10:55.360 --> 10:55.680]  All right.
[10:55.680 --> 10:56.720]  Back to the security issue.
[10:56.720 --> 11:03.760]  So all of Apple's operating systems were vulnerable to this
[11:03.760 --> 11:03.920]  threat.
[11:04.800 --> 11:07.840]  Yeah, all the current ones, and also two previous versions
[11:07.840 --> 11:09.360]  of OS X were tested.
[11:09.360 --> 11:12.720]  It's possible that older versions are also vulnerable,
[11:12.720 --> 11:13.920]  and they just didn't test them.
[11:13.920 --> 11:17.280]  I don't have clarity on that because the particular library
[11:17.280 --> 11:19.440]  may go back a bazillion years.
[11:19.440 --> 11:22.160]  Could be back to 10.6 or 10.0 for all we know.
[11:24.880 --> 11:29.120]  But there are no actual exploits in the wild, right?
[11:29.120 --> 11:30.480]  Or at least none that are known.
[11:31.040 --> 11:32.160]  None that are known.
[11:32.160 --> 11:33.040]  It's possible.
[11:33.040 --> 11:36.800]  So I talked to the folks at the Cisco division directly
[11:36.800 --> 11:38.160]  because I could not find...
[11:38.160 --> 11:39.040]  I saw this coverage.
[11:39.040 --> 11:40.160]  So you know how this works.
[11:40.160 --> 11:43.520]  Something happens related to Apple, and the news story
[11:43.520 --> 11:45.280]  is Apple computers burst into flames.
[11:45.280 --> 11:46.560]  That's like the next day.
[11:46.560 --> 11:48.240]  It's like, well, it was one computer in a lab.
[11:48.240 --> 11:49.680]  It was under controlled circumstance.
[11:49.680 --> 11:51.680]  No, no, Apple computers burst into flames.
[11:51.680 --> 11:55.200]  So Apple releases these updates, and then the engineer
[11:55.200 --> 11:57.360]  at Cisco, or sorry, Talos is the division.
[11:57.360 --> 12:00.240]  He writes up the guy who's in charge of this team,
[12:00.240 --> 12:02.000]  who's credited with the discovery by Apple.
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.800]  So it meant he used responsible disclosure, reported it
[12:04.800 --> 12:06.880]  months ago, Apple patched it all, everything's cool.
[12:06.880 --> 12:09.200]  He writes up a very detailed blog post that explains
[12:09.200 --> 12:12.160]  the severity, and then has some details about exactly
[12:12.160 --> 12:12.880]  what gets dumped.
[12:12.880 --> 12:15.760]  He puts some core dump information in, or traces
[12:15.760 --> 12:19.680]  and things, and people like the register and Forbes
[12:19.680 --> 12:20.400]  and whatever write these.
[12:20.400 --> 12:24.960]  It's stage fright for Apple, which is Android still
[12:24.960 --> 12:27.440]  is wrestling with stage fright, which was an MMS
[12:27.440 --> 12:31.680]  deliverable, among other vectors, a way to send
[12:31.680 --> 12:34.960]  a maliciously formatted message for Android 2.2
[12:34.960 --> 12:38.160]  and every subsequent system, and the problem with
[12:38.160 --> 12:40.560]  upgrading older Android systems and on and on.
[12:40.560 --> 12:42.000]  So stage fright remains.
[12:42.000 --> 12:43.760]  It's possible there's a couple hundred million
[12:43.760 --> 12:46.560]  Android devices that remain susceptible to stage fright.
[12:46.560 --> 12:47.120]  It's a big deal.
[12:47.120 --> 12:50.240]  And there were viruses that were discovered in the wild
[12:50.240 --> 12:53.120]  within, I think, weeks of the first stage fright release,
[12:53.920 --> 12:56.560]  and then months later, some more for devices
[12:56.560 --> 12:57.760]  that couldn't be patched.
[12:57.760 --> 13:04.640]  This touches on one of my very most precious pet themes
[13:04.640 --> 13:07.760]  in what I write about in media criticism, which
[13:07.760 --> 13:09.120]  is false equivalence.
[13:10.800 --> 13:12.880]  And it's a huge issue in politics.
[13:12.880 --> 13:15.280]  And it's definitely an issue in the tech world, too.
[13:15.280 --> 13:20.320]  And it's this idea that to be fair, or more cynically,
[13:20.320 --> 13:24.240]  to sensationalize the story.
[13:24.240 --> 13:26.720]  Because I think everybody knows that putting Apple
[13:26.720 --> 13:29.280]  into headlines gets more clicks.
[13:34.080 --> 13:37.440]  So Android had stage fright, or has stage fright,
[13:37.440 --> 13:39.520]  and has this issue that is actually
[13:39.520 --> 13:41.600]  being exploited in the world.
[13:41.600 --> 13:45.280]  And there are lots, not most, nobody
[13:45.280 --> 13:47.600]  is saying that every Android phone out there is hacked,
[13:47.600 --> 13:48.560]  or even most of them are.
[13:48.560 --> 13:51.840]  But that there are many people with Android devices
[13:51.840 --> 13:56.160]  that have malware, perhaps even unbeknownst to the user,
[13:56.160 --> 13:57.120]  because of this exploit.
[13:57.760 --> 14:02.640]  Then Apple has this, Cisco discovers this security problem
[14:02.640 --> 14:04.720]  in Apple's operating systems.
[14:04.720 --> 14:07.600]  And it's presented as though it's, like you just said,
[14:07.600 --> 14:09.920]  they're actually calling it Apple's version of stage fright,
[14:09.920 --> 14:12.240]  even though there aren't any known exploits.
[14:12.240 --> 14:14.240]  Right, it's a great narrative.
[14:14.240 --> 14:18.080]  And there are similarities, except sandboxing,
[14:18.080 --> 14:21.120]  and code signing, and so forth.
[14:21.120 --> 14:23.760]  There's a lot of spaces that are different in terms
[14:23.760 --> 14:25.920]  of how Android deals with incoming everything,
[14:25.920 --> 14:29.200]  or malicious software that's trying to execute on a system.
[14:29.200 --> 14:30.720]  There's other protections, even if you
[14:30.720 --> 14:32.480]  manage to deliver a payload.
[14:32.480 --> 14:34.560]  You may just crash a process, right?
[14:34.560 --> 14:36.160]  So I talked to the engineer.
[14:36.160 --> 14:37.360]  I went back and forth through email.
[14:37.360 --> 14:38.560]  I had to go through the PR folks.
[14:38.560 --> 14:41.040]  And it's like, is there a proof of concept?
[14:41.040 --> 14:42.640]  Because with stage fright, the researchers
[14:42.640 --> 14:45.600]  who did that delivered an effective proof of concept,
[14:45.600 --> 14:47.280]  showing not just that they could crash a process
[14:47.280 --> 14:49.440]  or overwrite a buffer, but that they could actually
[14:49.440 --> 14:51.280]  commit acts and gain root.
[14:51.280 --> 14:53.360]  If I recall, some Android systems,
[14:53.360 --> 14:55.920]  you could get root in some behalf.
[14:55.920 --> 14:57.920]  You could take control of the microphone
[14:57.920 --> 14:58.560]  and things like that.
[14:58.560 --> 15:01.360]  So there were ways to get access to system resources,
[15:01.360 --> 15:03.760]  even if you couldn't potentially gain root.
[15:03.760 --> 15:06.720]  And the Talos researcher said, in effect,
[15:06.720 --> 15:11.600]  we have a provable exploit that allows us to do nasty stuff
[15:11.600 --> 15:13.680]  with Safari and OS 10.
[15:13.680 --> 15:15.440]  And the reporting had been about MMS.
[15:16.400 --> 15:18.560]  But they have no exploit for that.
[15:18.560 --> 15:21.280]  They think there are some major hurdles in the way that
[15:21.280 --> 15:22.640]  might be able to be overcome.
[15:22.640 --> 15:24.320]  They weren't focusing on that because they
[15:24.320 --> 15:25.120]  knew it was going to be patched.
[15:25.120 --> 15:27.200]  They focused on something where they had a path already
[15:27.200 --> 15:27.760]  to do it.
[15:27.760 --> 15:30.880]  They suspect that the Safari plus OS 10 pathway
[15:30.880 --> 15:35.680]  would also let them exploit iOS and a Safari mobile Safari.
[15:35.680 --> 15:37.760]  They haven't tested it, but everything seems the same.
[15:37.760 --> 15:39.280]  They think there may be a few more bars in the way
[15:39.280 --> 15:40.880]  there, too, that could be overcome.
[15:40.880 --> 15:42.400]  This is all with the unpatched version.
[15:42.400 --> 15:45.760]  So the truth is, this is getting back to the beginning,
[15:45.760 --> 15:47.680]  is it's a severe bug.
[15:47.680 --> 15:49.920]  A few years ago, Apple had some Wi-Fi bugs
[15:49.920 --> 15:53.520]  where you could drive by and do terrible things
[15:53.520 --> 15:55.520]  to someone's Wi-Fi network and gain access
[15:55.520 --> 15:58.400]  and do all kinds of stuff to an airport base station
[15:58.400 --> 15:59.840]  or Mac, or sorry, Macintoshes.
[15:59.840 --> 16:02.400]  If you could just gain access, just have physical proximity.
[16:02.400 --> 16:05.040]  And it's especially terrifying because you don't actually
[16:05.040 --> 16:05.920]  have to be in their house.
[16:05.920 --> 16:08.400]  You just have to be within range of their Wi-Fi,
[16:08.400 --> 16:10.720]  which could be in a car in front of their house.
[16:11.680 --> 16:13.680]  Yeah, you just put a high gain antenna out the window
[16:13.680 --> 16:14.560]  and you can do it.
[16:14.560 --> 16:16.000]  And those, they were patched.
[16:16.000 --> 16:17.760]  And people had the same argument then.
[16:17.760 --> 16:19.760]  And this happened since, I think, in a lot of times.
[16:19.760 --> 16:22.240]  Is how severe is it if the threat is over?
[16:22.240 --> 16:23.760]  It's like, well, this is very severe.
[16:23.760 --> 16:26.960]  We don't know the, it's severe as an exploit.
[16:26.960 --> 16:28.400]  These things really are doing something
[16:28.400 --> 16:30.640]  really terribly wrong they shouldn't do
[16:30.640 --> 16:31.760]  and shouldn't be in the code.
[16:31.760 --> 16:32.560]  That's true.
[16:32.560 --> 16:34.800]  And conceivably, it's a pathway.
[16:34.800 --> 16:38.640]  The next steps are in the lab or malware could be developed
[16:38.640 --> 16:40.640]  that would then take advantage of it.
[16:40.640 --> 16:43.120]  And we could find out how severe in practice it is.
[16:43.120 --> 16:44.560]  In theory, it's very severe.
[16:44.560 --> 16:46.560]  But because of responsible disclosure
[16:46.560 --> 16:49.200]  and Apple being able to patch it in a timely manner,
[16:49.200 --> 16:51.280]  there's no evidence anything is in the wild.
[16:51.920 --> 16:54.240]  That said, this is the kind of thing when the,
[16:54.240 --> 16:56.480]  what was it, I'm blanking on the group in Italy
[16:56.480 --> 16:58.160]  that had all its files.
[16:58.160 --> 16:59.360]  Hacking, the hacking team.
[16:59.360 --> 17:00.240]  Hacking team.
[17:00.240 --> 17:01.600]  Hacking team or something like that.
[17:01.600 --> 17:02.480]  Yeah, those guys.
[17:02.480 --> 17:04.080]  And it's true of some other outfits
[17:04.080 --> 17:05.120]  that have had leaked information.
[17:05.120 --> 17:06.480]  These, you know, there's all these companies,
[17:06.480 --> 17:08.560]  it's individual researchers and companies
[17:08.560 --> 17:11.280]  that exist to find zero days and sell them to governments,
[17:11.280 --> 17:11.520]  right?
[17:11.520 --> 17:13.600]  And governments are also working on similar things.
[17:14.160 --> 17:17.760]  It's possible things like this are already completely known,
[17:17.760 --> 17:19.520]  it may be even to multiple parties,
[17:19.520 --> 17:21.760]  and they're being deployed against some Iranian official
[17:21.760 --> 17:24.000]  or American official or Chinese official
[17:24.000 --> 17:28.080]  or a company for, you know, for industrial espionage.
[17:28.080 --> 17:31.360]  And it's being specifically deployed in a very quiet way
[17:31.360 --> 17:34.080]  in which it allows them to exfiltrate information
[17:34.880 --> 17:37.680]  or, you know, tap communications.
[17:37.680 --> 17:40.720]  But the idea, it's not, if that's the case,
[17:40.720 --> 17:41.600]  that hasn't been found yet.
[17:41.600 --> 17:43.280]  Maybe it will now the bug is known,
[17:43.280 --> 17:45.280]  virus signatures will get updated, people will find it.
[17:45.280 --> 17:46.880]  So it's not in the wild.
[17:46.880 --> 17:54.560]  Yeah, there's the most obvious source of malware,
[17:54.560 --> 17:56.880]  the one that we see and hear about most often
[17:56.880 --> 17:59.840]  is the one that's sort of stuff that's sort of out in the open,
[17:59.840 --> 18:03.520]  where it's just almost like you almost want to say like,
[18:03.520 --> 18:08.480]  more like common criminals who either find exploits like this
[18:08.480 --> 18:10.560]  that you can go through, you know, a web page,
[18:10.560 --> 18:12.720]  or certainly, you know, email, click link,
[18:12.720 --> 18:14.320]  you know, click this link in an email.
[18:14.320 --> 18:16.400]  And if you're using a certain type of computer
[18:16.400 --> 18:21.920]  that has a known exploit, just by clicking the link,
[18:21.920 --> 18:24.880]  you know, you've got malware on your computer.
[18:24.880 --> 18:25.920]  And what does the malware do?
[18:25.920 --> 18:28.000]  A lot of times it sets up like a botnet
[18:28.000 --> 18:28.800]  or something like that.
[18:29.520 --> 18:33.200]  And it's like a shotgun approach to the crime,
[18:33.200 --> 18:35.840]  where they're trying to just get hundreds and thousands
[18:35.840 --> 18:36.800]  of random people.
[18:36.800 --> 18:38.800]  They don't even care who you are to run this
[18:38.800 --> 18:41.360]  and, you know, steal your bitcoins
[18:41.360 --> 18:42.560]  or whatever they want to do.
[18:42.560 --> 18:44.240]  That's the, you know, the stuff that we see.
[18:44.240 --> 18:47.440]  The part that, you know, the paranoid part of my mind
[18:47.440 --> 18:50.480]  is the, well, what about the Chinese government?
[18:50.480 --> 18:52.480]  The Chinese government would be, you know,
[18:53.680 --> 18:56.400]  are they employing people to find exploits like this?
[18:56.400 --> 18:57.760]  Of course they are, right?
[18:57.760 --> 19:00.720]  I mean, who, does anybody believe they're not?
[19:00.720 --> 19:04.560]  Does anybody think the NSA doesn't have really,
[19:04.560 --> 19:07.760]  really smart people doing this exact same thing?
[19:09.360 --> 19:11.040]  You know, anybody who's been doing this
[19:11.040 --> 19:14.800]  and then there's the companies, not just governments,
[19:14.800 --> 19:16.720]  but companies like the hacking team that you mentioned
[19:16.720 --> 19:20.000]  that sell their services, you know, to governments
[19:20.000 --> 19:20.800]  and stuff like that.
[19:20.800 --> 19:24.640]  But, you know, find these zero days and then hold,
[19:24.640 --> 19:26.960]  you know, instead of letting them loose,
[19:26.960 --> 19:28.320]  they're like a precious commodity.
[19:28.320 --> 19:30.720]  I mean, I think last year somebody was actually
[19:30.720 --> 19:32.880]  like in the public was saying, you know,
[19:34.240 --> 19:36.320]  we're gonna pay a million dollars if you can find
[19:36.320 --> 19:38.400]  an exploit for iOS 9 or something like that.
[19:38.400 --> 19:41.200]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, you know, a legitimate, I mean,
[19:41.200 --> 19:42.080]  sort of legitimate.
[19:42.080 --> 19:44.480]  I mean, it's sort of a scummy underside of the world,
[19:44.480 --> 19:47.760]  but, you know, a serious offer, a legitimate offer
[19:47.760 --> 19:50.080]  for a million dollars if you could deliver them
[19:50.080 --> 19:52.960]  an exploit that would let them do a buoyancy.
[19:53.760 --> 19:55.360]  Jailbreaking often falls to that, right?
[19:55.360 --> 19:56.880]  As there's companies that make a lot of money off
[19:57.520 --> 20:02.480]  third-party app stores for jailbroken iPhones, I think.
[20:02.480 --> 20:05.360]  And so there's money to be made if you get the exploit
[20:05.360 --> 20:10.000]  first, the Jailbreak Pathway first, some of them sell,
[20:10.000 --> 20:10.880]  jailbreaking is funny.
[20:10.880 --> 20:12.960]  Jailbreaking went from a very innocent enterprise
[20:12.960 --> 20:15.280]  in the early days to something that is now all enmeshed
[20:15.280 --> 20:18.080]  in viruses and criminal enterprise and so forth.
[20:18.080 --> 20:19.920]  There's still, I'm sure, legitimate people out there
[20:19.920 --> 20:22.640]  doing jailbreaking, but everything I read about it
[20:22.640 --> 20:24.640]  makes it sound like you don't know when you download
[20:24.640 --> 20:26.800]  the jailbreak tools what they're gonna do.
[20:26.800 --> 20:29.920]  I was talking to a friend of the show, Craig Hockenberry
[20:29.920 --> 20:36.640]  at WWDC, and we were laughing, thinking, like reminiscing
[20:36.640 --> 20:39.360]  to 10 years ago when the iPhone was new about how we all
[20:39.360 --> 20:40.400]  jailbroke our phones.
[20:40.400 --> 20:46.080]  Like, we all jailbroke our phones before the first
[20:46.080 --> 20:51.120]  C4 conference because somebody had created
[20:52.640 --> 20:56.080]  the Lights Out game, and it was a really nice game.
[20:56.080 --> 21:01.120]  It was just like, there was no Xcode for iOS yet.
[21:01.120 --> 21:02.880]  I mean, these were some really smart people.
[21:03.680 --> 21:10.400]  And there were no public tools at all to create iOS software
[21:10.400 --> 21:15.040]  and somehow, and Craig, eventually, during the jailbreak era
[21:15.040 --> 21:18.160]  got Twitterrific working.
[21:18.160 --> 21:21.360]  So of course I jailbroke my phone because then I had an
[21:21.360 --> 21:22.800]  iPhone with Twitterrific on it.
[21:22.800 --> 21:24.720]  And this is before you could have apps.
[21:24.720 --> 21:28.880]  I mean, of course I jailbroke, but it was, you know,
[21:28.880 --> 21:30.880]  it just seemed, it was a lot easier too.
[21:31.520 --> 21:34.720]  Innocent days back when it was just us kids playing around
[21:34.720 --> 21:35.280]  with the phone.
[21:36.320 --> 21:41.280]  Sidebar, counselor, EFF has just filed a lawsuit about
[21:42.160 --> 21:45.520]  Section 1201 of the DMCA, which I'm sure you're aware of.
[21:45.520 --> 21:46.560]  I saw the announcement.
[21:46.560 --> 21:49.840]  Yeah, it's, you know, DMCA, Digital Millennium Copyright
[21:49.840 --> 21:52.160]  Act, which I think is a largely unconstitutional piece
[21:52.160 --> 21:55.200]  of legislation that has never been fully tested.
[21:55.200 --> 21:57.680]  If the Supreme Court ever got his hands on it, I got to say
[21:57.680 --> 22:02.080]  there's so many things in there that give, they privilege
[22:02.080 --> 22:05.200]  commercial speech at the, in the face of free speech.
[22:05.200 --> 22:07.600]  And whenever I've seen anything like it, that's been decided
[22:07.600 --> 22:10.080]  by high courts, you know, either appeals or up the Supreme
[22:10.080 --> 22:13.040]  Court, it's usually, even if I don't agree with the decision
[22:13.040 --> 22:15.920]  entirely, it usually opens up the way for more speech,
[22:15.920 --> 22:17.440]  meaning more encoded speech.
[22:17.440 --> 22:20.320]  It's sort of now been encoded at a certain level of, you
[22:20.320 --> 22:23.120]  know, the court systems, even if it's not totally understood.
[22:23.120 --> 22:26.320]  So one provision of the DMCA is this reverse engineering
[22:26.320 --> 22:28.080]  thing related to digital rights management.
[22:28.080 --> 22:31.600]  And if you put DRM on something as a manufacturer, it's
[22:31.600 --> 22:34.800]  illegal and you can be sent to jail for years, for four,
[22:34.800 --> 22:36.720]  I'm sorry, four years, not for four years.
[22:36.720 --> 22:38.320]  I forgot to see if it's like five years, I think.
[22:39.520 --> 22:42.160]  If you reverse engineer it, even for yourself, like in the
[22:42.160 --> 22:44.960]  privacy of your own home, FBI breaks in, you've been breaking
[22:44.960 --> 22:47.440]  DRM and not distributing it, you go to jail.
[22:47.440 --> 22:50.320]  And there's a provision called section 1201, which is the
[22:50.320 --> 22:52.240]  most hilarious thing in the world.
[22:52.240 --> 22:56.240]  Every three years, more or less, the librarian of Congress
[22:56.800 --> 22:58.640]  holds hearings, not them personally.
[22:58.640 --> 23:00.320]  And the last, you know, we just got a new one.
[23:00.320 --> 23:00.960]  Isn't this awesome?
[23:00.960 --> 23:03.440]  The Senate actually approved the confirmation.
[23:04.160 --> 23:06.560]  New librarian of Congress understands technology has run
[23:06.560 --> 23:07.360]  a library system.
[23:07.360 --> 23:09.200]  She's the voice of the future.
[23:09.200 --> 23:10.080]  This is going to be great.
[23:10.080 --> 23:12.960]  The guy who's been in charge for decades has been kind of a
[23:12.960 --> 23:16.080]  know nothing Luddite, just terrible in terms of the
[23:16.080 --> 23:18.240]  technology side, great in terms of books.
[23:18.240 --> 23:21.200]  Anyway, so the section 1201 hearings, it's a circus.
[23:21.200 --> 23:24.720]  You have the process described in the law is terrible.
[23:24.720 --> 23:29.040]  So the librarian of Congress created a process that
[23:29.040 --> 23:33.440]  basically people who object to limitations and want to get
[23:33.440 --> 23:37.120]  them removed temporarily only for a three-year period have
[23:37.120 --> 23:39.360]  to essentially file something like a legal brief, although
[23:39.360 --> 23:41.520]  it can be in more plain language explaining why there's
[23:41.520 --> 23:46.240]  a legitimate public interest to be served in providing exemption.
[23:46.240 --> 23:48.160]  And then the librarian, so they have this circus, they
[23:48.160 --> 23:50.880]  have hearings and people pray through and they testify.
[23:50.880 --> 23:54.560]  And the last time I think there were 47 different subgroup
[23:55.520 --> 23:58.320]  items being presented and it's just, and it's, you know,
[23:58.320 --> 24:00.960]  farming, it's companies like John Deere who have DRM on
[24:00.960 --> 24:06.080]  their tractors, automakers, video game makers, printer
[24:06.080 --> 24:10.160]  companies as well as the software and you know, like
[24:10.160 --> 24:11.920]  iPhone locking and the rest of it.
[24:11.920 --> 24:13.840]  And then there's people who, you know, file these
[24:13.840 --> 24:15.440]  objections and there's back and forth.
[24:15.440 --> 24:18.800]  And then the library of Congress issues a set of rules
[24:18.800 --> 24:20.720]  about what's going to be exempted, if anything, in the
[24:20.720 --> 24:22.560]  next three-year period, it's a ridiculous process.
[24:22.560 --> 24:26.160]  So the EFF is suing basically on the
[24:26.160 --> 24:29.280]  unconstitutionality of the, of this provision.
[24:29.280 --> 24:32.720]  And if it were struck down or even minimized, it would
[24:32.720 --> 24:36.160]  dramatically enhance the ability of people to do self
[24:36.160 --> 24:38.800]  repair, which is, you know, Kyle Wiens at iFixit.
[24:38.800 --> 24:41.680]  He's been a huge proponent and deeply active in this
[24:41.680 --> 24:42.560]  process.
[24:42.560 --> 24:44.960]  And you can read a lot of stuff about right to repair
[24:44.960 --> 24:47.280]  that relates a lot to DRM these days.
[24:48.240 --> 24:55.600]  A specific provision in the digital, DMCA, not DCMA.
[24:55.600 --> 24:57.760]  Yeah, digital because it was-
[24:57.760 --> 24:58.880]  Millennium copyright.
[24:59.920 --> 25:01.520]  I can't remember if Sonny Bono was involved in that one,
[25:01.520 --> 25:02.000]  but maybe.
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.960]  There's a Sonny Bono law also, but that's a different one.
[25:04.960 --> 25:08.160]  It's specifically, it more or less outlaws backwards
[25:08.160 --> 25:11.120]  reverse engineering, how DRM works.
[25:11.120 --> 25:14.480]  And reverse engineering is, you know, here, you've got
[25:14.480 --> 25:15.920]  this thing, you own it.
[25:15.920 --> 25:18.160]  Are you allowed to try to figure out how it works?
[25:18.160 --> 25:21.200]  And, and that's, you know, it's, I think that's been
[25:21.200 --> 25:26.000]  considered part of, you know, I guess free speech, but
[25:26.000 --> 25:29.120]  certainly seems like something that, you know, I don't
[25:29.120 --> 25:31.680]  know, the engineer in me objects to, we've got this
[25:31.680 --> 25:36.560]  magic thing called, you know, copyright for our movies
[25:36.560 --> 25:39.920]  and music, and it gets a special exemption for this
[25:39.920 --> 25:40.880]  that nothing else has.
[25:41.840 --> 25:42.080]  Yeah.
[25:42.080 --> 25:44.480]  And, you know, I just learned something and that's
[25:44.480 --> 25:46.080]  terrible because it keeps innovation.
[25:46.080 --> 25:48.720]  You know, how did everything interesting happen that's
[25:48.720 --> 25:49.120]  going on?
[25:49.120 --> 25:51.360]  You know, some people point to giant corporate research
[25:51.360 --> 25:52.080]  labs.
[25:52.080 --> 25:54.400]  So many interesting things we're doing in technology
[25:54.400 --> 25:57.360]  came from people tinkering at little stuff that they
[25:57.360 --> 25:58.400]  took apart, right?
[25:58.400 --> 25:59.840]  I saw Kate McKinnon, who I love.
[25:59.840 --> 26:01.600]  We're going to talk about Ghostbusters later, right?
[26:01.600 --> 26:02.320]  We'll talk about Ghostbusters.
[26:02.320 --> 26:03.440]  I have not seen the movie yet.
[26:03.440 --> 26:04.160]  I won't talk about the movie.
[26:04.160 --> 26:04.320]  We'll talk.
[26:04.320 --> 26:05.840]  We're gonna talk about Twitter or whatever.
[26:05.840 --> 26:06.160]  Okay.
[26:07.120 --> 26:08.960]  I am one of the, my, one of the few people who still
[26:08.960 --> 26:09.760]  watches SNL.
[26:09.760 --> 26:12.320]  I watch it and Lynn and I, my wife, we fast forward.
[26:12.320 --> 26:12.800]  We tape it.
[26:12.800 --> 26:14.400]  We watch it like a few days later.
[26:14.400 --> 26:16.000]  We fast forward through the bad stuff.
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.480]  There are a bunch of really great performers.
[26:18.480 --> 26:21.360]  A lot of people our age have given up an SNL long.
[26:22.880 --> 26:24.080]  We're big SNL fans here.
[26:24.080 --> 26:24.560]  Oh, good.
[26:24.560 --> 26:24.880]  Yeah.
[26:24.880 --> 26:26.640]  And it's hit or miss as you know, sometimes you're
[26:26.640 --> 26:27.520]  watching an entire episode.
[26:27.520 --> 26:30.000]  You're like, I don't even know what happened.
[26:30.000 --> 26:31.760]  And then another time you're crying for.
[26:31.760 --> 26:33.360]  It's always been like that.
[26:33.360 --> 26:34.960]  It's always been totally right.
[26:34.960 --> 26:37.120]  And I have this, I have the same memory of, no, wasn't
[26:37.120 --> 26:38.160]  it always, no, it wasn't.
[26:38.160 --> 26:40.160]  So Kate McKinnon, you love her then cause you watch it.
[26:40.160 --> 26:43.760]  She's an incredible mimic and she's great in Ghostbusters.
[26:43.760 --> 26:45.360]  She is such a, I've seen her interviewed.
[26:45.360 --> 26:47.520]  I just think she is so great.
[26:47.520 --> 26:50.000]  And we're at the beginning of her breakout part of her
[26:50.000 --> 26:51.680]  career, like Kristen Wiig already had.
[26:51.680 --> 26:51.920]  Right.
[26:51.920 --> 26:52.560]  And this is it.
[26:52.560 --> 26:54.080]  So Kate McKinnon, I see this interview.
[26:54.080 --> 26:56.000]  She's on the red carpet for Ghostbusters and this
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.720]  tiny little girl, it's supposed to be like eight or
[26:58.720 --> 27:00.080]  nine is doing interviews.
[27:00.720 --> 27:02.960]  And she asked Kate McKinnon a question and Kate McKinnon
[27:02.960 --> 27:05.680]  looks so touched and in love and then looks at her very
[27:05.680 --> 27:07.040]  seriously and gives her this answer.
[27:07.040 --> 27:09.680]  And the girl said, what was it like to work around all this
[27:09.680 --> 27:10.960]  cool technology in the movie?
[27:10.960 --> 27:13.520]  And Kate McKinnon said, when I was a kid, I used to love
[27:13.520 --> 27:14.640]  to take things apart.
[27:14.640 --> 27:16.560]  Radio things, I look at the circuit boards and whatever.
[27:16.560 --> 27:19.360]  And this whole movie, I walk in, everything is circuit
[27:19.360 --> 27:20.960]  boards and it's just, it was a dream.
[27:20.960 --> 27:23.760]  It was like my childhood again, something like that.
[27:23.760 --> 27:26.880]  And I'm thinking that is the kind of thing that kids,
[27:26.880 --> 27:27.920]  kids today, they don't know.
[27:27.920 --> 27:30.560]  They're not encouraged to take things apart.
[27:30.560 --> 27:33.200]  They could actually be violating the law if they were to
[27:33.200 --> 27:35.680]  know in the software side to circumvent things.
[27:35.680 --> 27:38.000]  Literally this kids could be violating federal law for
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.480]  doing the stuff that you and I did and all, you know,
[27:40.480 --> 27:41.840]  millions and millions of other children.
[27:41.840 --> 27:44.400]  It is certainly the case that the overwhelming majority
[27:44.400 --> 27:47.440]  of all people have almost no curiosity about how things
[27:47.440 --> 27:49.120]  work, which is fine, which is fine.
[27:49.120 --> 27:53.440]  But for the minority of people who are curious about how
[27:53.440 --> 27:56.720]  things work, those also tend to be the sort of people who
[27:56.720 --> 27:58.000]  create new things, you know?
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.080]  And I mean, you could, I think you could find that with
[28:00.080 --> 28:03.680]  creative people in, like you said, entertainers, even
[28:03.680 --> 28:04.240]  entertainers.
[28:04.240 --> 28:07.680]  That's, it's just like a mindset of, I would like to take
[28:07.680 --> 28:08.240]  that apart.
[28:09.920 --> 28:12.720]  It is a very refinishing tables too.
[28:12.720 --> 28:14.320]  She's got a crafty aspect to her.
[28:14.320 --> 28:14.640]  She does.
[28:15.760 --> 28:21.280]  So my take on it is that I think it's, I object
[28:21.280 --> 28:23.760]  philosophically to the idea that you should outlaw being
[28:23.760 --> 28:26.000]  able to take things apart and figure out how they work.
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.560]  But on the flip side, I also think that the people who make
[28:28.560 --> 28:31.600]  things have every right to make them as difficult to take
[28:31.600 --> 28:36.880]  apart or as, you know, like in the case with Apple and cell
[28:36.880 --> 28:39.520]  phone encryption, that if Apple can figure out a way to
[28:39.520 --> 28:43.920]  mathematically make the contents of a phone effectively
[28:45.440 --> 28:48.720]  unbreakable encryption wise, they have the right to do that.
[28:48.720 --> 28:52.160]  And the NSA has a right to try to find the holes in their
[28:52.160 --> 28:52.560]  logic.
[28:52.560 --> 28:53.120]  Oh, yeah.
[28:53.120 --> 28:55.600]  I don't think manufacturers should be obliged to make it
[28:55.600 --> 28:55.840]  easy.
[28:55.840 --> 28:58.000]  I think that could be a marketing strategy and some do
[28:58.000 --> 28:58.160]  that.
[28:58.160 --> 29:00.880]  I was talking to a company that I can't reveal that said,
[29:00.880 --> 29:04.240]  because of various regulations, they're not allowed to promote
[29:04.240 --> 29:06.960]  the fact that their product is modifiable because it would
[29:06.960 --> 29:08.880]  actually put them in violation and put them in a new
[29:08.880 --> 29:10.080]  regulatory framework.
[29:10.080 --> 29:13.760]  However, they can make their product a modifiable, including
[29:13.760 --> 29:16.480]  the firmware, and they just can't say anything about it.
[29:16.480 --> 29:18.320]  So they are actually doing everything they can.
[29:19.040 --> 29:22.240]  A great example is that I can talk about is Chumby, which is
[29:22.240 --> 29:25.600]  Bunny Huang, who's one of the plaintiffs in the EFF suit
[29:25.600 --> 29:26.720]  that's coming up.
[29:26.720 --> 29:28.480]  Bunny lives in Singapore.
[29:28.480 --> 29:29.520]  I think he still lives in Singapore.
[29:29.520 --> 29:31.200]  It goes to Shenzhen all the time.
[29:31.200 --> 29:33.120]  He's a hands-on designer.
[29:33.120 --> 29:34.640]  He's been designing an open laptop.
[29:34.640 --> 29:36.640]  That's just a fascinating, it's not, there's a little
[29:36.640 --> 29:38.720]  ideology in it, but it's also an incredible technical
[29:38.720 --> 29:39.360]  exercise.
[29:39.360 --> 29:42.400]  He was one of the people behind Chumby, which was originally
[29:42.400 --> 29:46.240]  this kind of soft alarm clock that you could make apps for
[29:46.240 --> 29:47.440]  like many years ago.
[29:47.440 --> 29:47.680]  Yeah.
[29:47.680 --> 29:48.880]  And it went through a lot of revisions.
[29:48.880 --> 29:49.520]  It's still out there.
[29:49.520 --> 29:52.160]  A company, so they left everything in such a state that
[29:52.160 --> 29:55.040]  when the product didn't succeed, people could keep it
[29:55.040 --> 29:58.000]  alive and then a new company came in to support it.
[29:58.000 --> 30:00.160]  And then that company is now making new Chumby stuff and
[30:00.160 --> 30:04.480]  running the servers because enough was open and available.
[30:04.480 --> 30:06.000]  I don't think the whole thing was open source.
[30:06.000 --> 30:08.160]  I'm forgetting all the details, but they had left
[30:08.160 --> 30:09.200]  everything open enough.
[30:09.200 --> 30:11.600]  And then I think when it was shutting down, they opened
[30:11.600 --> 30:12.400]  it even further.
[30:12.400 --> 30:14.320]  And I'm like, that was a wonderful thing.
[30:14.320 --> 30:16.560]  So as a company, you could choose to do that, but you can
[30:16.560 --> 30:20.160]  also choose to be rat bastards or pursue security, let's
[30:20.160 --> 30:23.040]  say whichever you want and not make it easy.
[30:23.040 --> 30:25.200]  That's totally, I mean, I don't, I don't think being,
[30:25.760 --> 30:26.560]  there's a difference there.
[30:26.560 --> 30:29.200]  Like should Apple allow third-party apps that are not
[30:29.200 --> 30:29.920]  sold from its store?
[30:29.920 --> 30:31.680]  I should say non apps or apps.
[30:31.680 --> 30:32.880]  That's a whole interesting debate.
[30:32.880 --> 30:35.040]  And there's an argument to be made that they should be
[30:35.040 --> 30:38.320]  required, even if they have to put hurdles in and switches
[30:38.320 --> 30:40.240]  and you have to agree, you're going to avoid your warranty
[30:40.240 --> 30:43.280]  or whatever that's separate from should Apple let its
[30:43.280 --> 30:45.200]  firmware be hackable.
[30:45.200 --> 30:46.800]  That's a very different situation.
[30:46.800 --> 30:51.120]  They, they shouldn't pursue people who have broken into
[30:51.120 --> 30:51.440]  it.
[30:51.440 --> 30:54.560]  That's where the DRM issue lies rather than they should
[30:54.560 --> 30:56.800]  make it easy, which is a sort of philosophical,
[30:56.800 --> 30:58.400]  ideological situation.
[30:59.200 --> 31:00.320]  Um, all right.
[31:00.320 --> 31:03.200]  And that's where I disagree with the, what's his name?
[31:03.200 --> 31:06.800]  Wines from, uh, the, uh, Mac fix it.
[31:06.800 --> 31:07.600]  What's the point?
[31:07.600 --> 31:07.760]  Yeah.
[31:07.760 --> 31:10.720]  I fix it like the pentalobe screw thing was a big, that
[31:10.720 --> 31:11.840]  was an inflection point, right?
[31:11.840 --> 31:15.120]  As Apple switched to pentalobe screws, it was hard to get
[31:15.120 --> 31:15.920]  such a screwdriver.
[31:15.920 --> 31:19.680]  Then iFixit made it, which is great, but Kyle maintained,
[31:19.680 --> 31:23.600]  I think that, uh, yeah, he, he, uh, he said Apple is doing
[31:23.600 --> 31:25.280]  this to make it hard to repair.
[31:25.280 --> 31:27.840]  Some people said maybe it's because it's easier to do
[31:27.840 --> 31:30.160]  machine creation, but that was, you know, machine, uh,
[31:30.160 --> 31:33.280]  assembly that's who knows, but it definitely made it
[31:33.280 --> 31:34.080]  harder to repair.
[31:34.080 --> 31:36.560]  And then, you know, pentalobe screwdrivers got made and
[31:36.560 --> 31:37.360]  now it's possible.
[31:37.360 --> 31:40.240]  But, um, I agree that Apple probably does some things to
[31:40.240 --> 31:44.000]  make it harder for third, for consumers and third parties
[31:44.000 --> 31:45.440]  to make changes and other things.
[31:45.440 --> 31:46.800]  I think it's, they don't care.
[31:46.800 --> 31:48.640]  They just engineer it because they know they're going to
[31:48.640 --> 31:50.720]  repair it so they don't give a damn if it's hard because
[31:50.720 --> 31:51.520]  they'll take care of it.
[31:51.520 --> 31:52.000]  Right.
[31:52.000 --> 31:55.360]  I think that there's, uh, it's, it's funny because that's
[31:55.360 --> 31:56.320]  a perfect example.
[31:56.320 --> 31:59.040]  And, and I, I try to be like this as much as I can.
[31:59.040 --> 32:03.760]  So I disagree with, with Kyle on, on his take on this, but
[32:03.760 --> 32:06.880]  I'm intrigued by his argument and I don't, you know, I don't
[32:06.880 --> 32:09.840]  think that I don't say this guy's an idiot.
[32:09.840 --> 32:11.680]  I, I disagree with him.
[32:11.680 --> 32:14.800]  I do believe that he's wrong, but I, I always do enjoy
[32:14.800 --> 32:16.640]  reading his pieces, arguing about it.
[32:16.640 --> 32:19.040]  Oh, he's pushing and he pushes the, the, he pushes the
[32:19.040 --> 32:21.120]  envelope in a way that's good for everybody, even if you
[32:21.120 --> 32:22.000]  disagree with them.
[32:22.000 --> 32:25.440]  There's nothing wrong with the idea that Apple could roll
[32:25.440 --> 32:26.960]  back to Phillips head screws.
[32:26.960 --> 32:28.960]  Like that doesn't make things worse for anyone.
[32:28.960 --> 32:31.280]  Even if you disagree with why they switched to Pentalobe.
[32:31.280 --> 32:33.360]  Um, I want to point that since we're in a sidebar, we're
[32:33.360 --> 32:35.600]  sort of side barring a sidebar, there's a great piece
[32:35.600 --> 32:37.920]  about warranties and motherboard last month.
[32:37.920 --> 32:40.560]  I don't know if you saw this how Sony, Microsoft and other
[32:40.560 --> 32:43.120]  gadget makers violate federal warranty law.
[32:43.120 --> 32:46.400]  And I am going to send you, um, this is a
[32:46.400 --> 32:47.040]  great piece.
[32:47.040 --> 32:48.640]  I never knew this.
[32:48.640 --> 32:52.240]  Most, uh, all the things that say break the seal and you
[32:52.240 --> 32:54.800]  violate warranty are actually either illegal or
[32:54.800 --> 32:56.080]  unenforceable.
[32:56.080 --> 33:00.000]  I had no idea the 1970 law called the Magnus and Moss
[33:00.000 --> 33:01.200]  warranty act.
[33:01.200 --> 33:03.360]  Federal law says you can open your electronics without
[33:03.360 --> 33:05.440]  voiding the warranty, regardless of what the language
[33:05.440 --> 33:06.720]  of that warranty says.
[33:06.720 --> 33:09.200]  People should read this cause I was, had my mind blown.
[33:09.200 --> 33:11.920]  Every single hard drive I've ever purchased has a sticker
[33:11.920 --> 33:12.960]  like that somewhere on it.
[33:12.960 --> 33:16.720]  Um, but I always thought that it was kind of reasonable for
[33:16.720 --> 33:19.840]  like a hard drive because it, especially in the spinning
[33:19.840 --> 33:22.000]  disc era, if you open up, if you get to the point where
[33:22.000 --> 33:25.360]  you open up and expose the disc and it, and it picks up
[33:25.360 --> 33:26.960]  dust and then doesn't work right.
[33:26.960 --> 33:28.560]  Well, why shouldn't your warranty be?
[33:28.560 --> 33:31.120]  Well, yeah, it's not that, but it's, the thing is the
[33:31.120 --> 33:34.400]  warranty isn't de facto violated by, uh, by breaking
[33:34.400 --> 33:36.320]  the seal and that's the thing.
[33:36.320 --> 33:39.040]  And, or even doing a repair that the, um, the article
[33:39.040 --> 33:41.840]  notes and they got some great, you know, uh, liability
[33:41.840 --> 33:45.120]  lawyers, 11 law lawyers talk about it is the manufacturer
[33:45.120 --> 33:48.000]  has to prove that your, whatever you did caused the
[33:48.000 --> 33:48.240]  failure.
[33:48.240 --> 33:49.040]  Ah, gotcha.
[33:49.040 --> 33:50.560]  That's so they can do that.
[33:50.560 --> 33:51.920]  They can say there's dust on the drive.
[33:51.920 --> 33:53.360]  There wasn't dust originally.
[33:53.360 --> 33:54.240]  It worked when you got it.
[33:54.240 --> 33:54.880]  So screw you.
[33:55.440 --> 33:55.760]  Yeah.
[33:55.760 --> 33:58.720]  I see that going back to Kyle wines.
[33:58.720 --> 34:02.240]  I think his argument would be bolstered if he stopped
[34:02.240 --> 34:06.560]  attributing malice to Apple and simply stated why he
[34:06.560 --> 34:10.400]  thinks these would be better devices with standard screws.
[34:10.400 --> 34:12.720]  And I know one of his other bugaboos is the use of glue.
[34:13.440 --> 34:17.200]  Uh, you know, and to, you know, make, just make the
[34:17.200 --> 34:19.840]  argument that this would be a better device for everybody.
[34:20.400 --> 34:24.240]  If you know, they, they stopped using glue and stuff
[34:24.240 --> 34:24.880]  like that.
[34:24.880 --> 34:27.920]  And instead of saying that they're doing this to make it
[34:27.920 --> 34:31.280]  hard to repair, Apple does not care about the repair shops.
[34:31.280 --> 34:33.600]  They don't, they, they, they give no shits.
[34:33.600 --> 34:34.320]  It's tiny.
[34:34.320 --> 34:34.720]  Yeah.
[34:34.720 --> 34:37.680]  And yeah, it's also like, this is a case, uh, this is,
[34:37.680 --> 34:38.640]  I'm, this is not a sidebar.
[34:38.640 --> 34:39.200]  I swear to God.
[34:39.200 --> 34:42.000]  I'm like the biggest parentheses Nestor, as you know.
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.320]  Um, but Walt Hickey wrote this great piece that I
[34:44.320 --> 34:45.600]  think he's at five 38.
[34:45.600 --> 34:48.400]  I think that's right about, um, he's, I love his writing.
[34:48.400 --> 34:52.080]  And he wrote this thing about how IMDb, uh, movies, uh,
[34:52.080 --> 34:58.400]  movie scores are, um, are sunk by male trolls because
[34:58.400 --> 35:02.080]  they did the analysis and you can see that men more
[35:02.080 --> 35:05.440]  highly, uh, downvote or give poor ratings to movies
[35:05.440 --> 35:07.920]  that women like better than, and women do not do the
[35:07.920 --> 35:10.960]  same thing to male films, uh, films that men like better.
[35:10.960 --> 35:12.720]  So, you can look at films that more men have seen,
[35:12.720 --> 35:14.480]  there's gender split, you know, and so forth.
[35:14.480 --> 35:16.640]  And, uh, you can do that analysis and figure it out.
[35:16.640 --> 35:18.320]  And the article is really interesting, but the one
[35:18.320 --> 35:20.800]  thing I disagree with him on is he was attributing malice.
[35:20.800 --> 35:24.000]  He said effectively that men are trolling as opposed
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.720]  to internalizing their own toxic masculinity and
[35:26.720 --> 35:29.120]  voting stuff down because they thought no one should
[35:29.120 --> 35:31.280]  see it sort of Ghostbusters thing again, like, well,
[35:31.280 --> 35:32.960]  if you haven't seen the movie and you're voting to
[35:32.960 --> 35:35.440]  three, you're kind of a troll, but some people may
[35:35.440 --> 35:36.640]  have, may have seen it.
[35:36.640 --> 35:39.200]  You don't know how many haven't seen it, how have,
[35:39.200 --> 35:39.920]  and whatever.
[35:39.920 --> 35:42.000]  I feel like the same thing a bit with people who
[35:42.000 --> 35:43.920]  attribute things to Apple.
[35:43.920 --> 35:47.200]  If you know, if you could pull it out and say, um,
[35:47.200 --> 35:49.840]  I talked to, or, you know, or an Apple engineer
[35:49.840 --> 35:52.240]  goes public and says, I worked at Apple for 20 years
[35:52.240 --> 35:55.440]  and the things we did to screw repair firms, then
[35:55.440 --> 35:56.320]  you can say malice.
[35:56.320 --> 35:59.520]  My job was to make it, uh, difficult or impossible
[35:59.520 --> 36:02.720]  to replace your screen at a third-party facility
[36:02.720 --> 36:05.520]  because Apple wants the a hundred dollar replacement
[36:05.520 --> 36:06.080]  fee.
[36:06.080 --> 36:08.640]  I was the extra glue engineer at Apple, continuing
[36:08.640 --> 36:09.360]  glue engineer.
[36:10.080 --> 36:12.560]  Um, this is good.
[36:12.560 --> 36:13.600]  I think I can unwind.
[36:13.600 --> 36:19.600]  I want to go back to the, um, the security bug.
[36:19.600 --> 36:20.240]  Yeah.
[36:20.240 --> 36:23.120]  So all the way, all the way back to this, this
[36:23.120 --> 36:24.800]  responsible, what do you, what is it called?
[36:24.800 --> 36:25.440]  Responsible?
[36:26.000 --> 36:26.720]  Is it like, I don't know.
[36:26.720 --> 36:28.880]  I may know if this is like responsible disclosure
[36:28.880 --> 36:29.040]  policy.
[36:30.240 --> 36:33.680]  So in some aspect though, it's not responsible
[36:33.680 --> 36:36.240]  because the only things that are updated are the
[36:36.240 --> 36:39.760]  very latest update to the O S I'm talking to you
[36:39.760 --> 36:42.800]  right now on through an iMac that has not been
[36:42.800 --> 36:45.040]  updated because I didn't feel like restarting my
[36:45.040 --> 36:46.400]  Mac before we started the show.
[36:46.400 --> 36:46.800]  Right.
[36:46.800 --> 36:49.920]  So my, the Mac I'm talking to you on right now
[36:49.920 --> 36:51.040]  is not updated.
[36:51.680 --> 36:55.360]  Uh, my iPhone is, I thoroughly doubt that my sons
[36:55.360 --> 37:00.160]  or wife's iPhones are, uh, I pretty sure my iPad
[37:00.160 --> 37:01.600]  is not because I haven't.
[37:01.600 --> 37:02.080]  Oh no.
[37:02.080 --> 37:04.560]  Yeah, it might because I'm running iOS 10 beta.
[37:04.560 --> 37:07.360]  So I don't know, but I, I have devices, I'm
[37:07.360 --> 37:09.760]  technically adept and I in tune to the news.
[37:10.560 --> 37:12.960]  Uh, and I have devices that aren't updated yet.
[37:12.960 --> 37:17.520]  And let alone anybody who hasn't updated to,
[37:17.520 --> 37:22.400]  um, uh, El Capitan yet, if you're running, you
[37:22.400 --> 37:26.720]  know, uh, uh, what was the one before, uh, Yosemite,
[37:26.720 --> 37:29.520]  I know Yosemite, keep looking it up.
[37:29.520 --> 37:33.360]  Um, you know, you're still, you're still vulnerable.
[37:33.360 --> 37:35.600]  Um, and I don't know if Apple, you know, nobody
[37:35.600 --> 37:37.360]  knows cause Apple won't say, but whether Apple
[37:37.360 --> 37:39.120]  is going to do a security update for those things
[37:39.120 --> 37:39.520]  either.
[37:39.520 --> 37:42.640]  So in some sense, I often wonder about disclosing
[37:42.640 --> 37:45.200]  these things, you know, whether it's, it's good or
[37:45.200 --> 37:45.920]  bad.
[37:45.920 --> 37:47.200]  Well, there's a, yeah, there's a couple of
[37:47.200 --> 37:48.960]  different, uh, aspects to it, right?
[37:48.960 --> 37:52.560]  If there's a zero day, um, you know, which does
[37:52.560 --> 37:53.920]  for benefit of listeners who don't know zero
[37:53.920 --> 37:56.800]  days in an exploit that is known as something
[37:56.800 --> 37:57.360]  is patched.
[37:57.360 --> 38:00.960]  So the patch comes out and it's known, um, that
[38:00.960 --> 38:03.120]  it's in a, it's in malware that's being used,
[38:03.120 --> 38:03.360]  right?
[38:03.360 --> 38:05.680]  So, uh, uh, it has to be patched immediately
[38:05.680 --> 38:06.960]  because you have to protect people who are in
[38:06.960 --> 38:07.760]  active danger.
[38:07.760 --> 38:09.120]  So this is not a zero day.
[38:09.120 --> 38:11.040]  Uh, there's no known attacks in the wild.
[38:11.040 --> 38:12.400]  I haven't seen anything in the last couple of
[38:12.400 --> 38:14.720]  days that suggested anyone had managed to exploit
[38:14.720 --> 38:15.600]  this in any Broadway.
[38:15.600 --> 38:18.000]  And we'd know that cause Mac users and iOS users,
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.320]  if it had been sent out as general malware would
[38:20.320 --> 38:22.960]  have been reporting I've been hijacked or whatever
[38:22.960 --> 38:25.680]  because malware distributors are not subtle.
[38:25.680 --> 38:26.960]  Typically there'd be ransom.
[38:26.960 --> 38:28.240]  I mean, the big thing right now is ransomware
[38:28.240 --> 38:29.680]  is, you know, I've been running about that
[38:29.680 --> 38:31.280]  recently, got a couple articles on it.
[38:31.280 --> 38:35.120]  And, um, anyway, so we, so, uh, this isn't a zero
[38:35.120 --> 38:37.040]  day, but this is the tricky part.
[38:37.040 --> 38:39.120]  Like if you don't think that it's in the wild,
[38:39.120 --> 38:40.800]  like you're working for a security company,
[38:40.800 --> 38:42.480]  there's no reports of this coming out that you've
[38:42.480 --> 38:43.520]  been analyzing.
[38:43.520 --> 38:45.360]  You've found it per, you know, proactively in
[38:45.360 --> 38:47.360]  advance or, you know, prospectively.
[38:47.360 --> 38:49.840]  Um, and you know, the patch has been made and
[38:49.840 --> 38:52.080]  distributed so anyone can get it, has it, that
[38:52.080 --> 38:54.240]  removes the financial incentive for any criminal
[38:54.240 --> 38:57.520]  to criminal organization to try to find an exploit
[38:57.520 --> 38:59.680]  because the window is closing so fast.
[38:59.680 --> 39:02.240]  Like, you know, 25% of it's closed in the first
[39:02.240 --> 39:05.920]  few hours and Apple pushes updates so heavily
[39:05.920 --> 39:07.760]  it makes it hard to ignore them, especially in
[39:07.760 --> 39:11.440]  iOS and other platforms that the odds of having
[39:11.440 --> 39:12.800]  a target are very small.
[39:12.800 --> 39:15.200]  So you spend weeks or months developing the
[39:15.200 --> 39:17.440]  payload of the exploit technology to deliver
[39:17.440 --> 39:18.400]  the correct payload.
[39:18.400 --> 39:21.040]  And by then 93% of people have updated and you
[39:21.040 --> 39:22.240]  have, you know, a couple hundred thousand
[39:22.240 --> 39:24.720]  people you have to reach and even spam and
[39:24.720 --> 39:26.640]  phishing doesn't make it worthwhile to send out
[39:26.640 --> 39:29.040]  the messages to reach a fraction of them.
[39:29.040 --> 39:31.440]  So the economics of it are bad when it's not a
[39:31.440 --> 39:31.760]  zero day.
[39:31.760 --> 39:33.760]  When it's a zero day, you disclose because it's
[39:33.760 --> 39:35.520]  so dangerous and you want everyone to patch
[39:35.520 --> 39:37.680]  right away and the economics there change
[39:37.680 --> 39:38.320]  instantly too.
[39:38.320 --> 39:40.320]  But there's exploits out there that will be
[39:40.320 --> 39:42.240]  tried to be put out as fast as they can before
[39:42.240 --> 39:42.800]  people patch.
[39:43.360 --> 39:45.600]  Uh, let me take a break here and thank our first
[39:45.600 --> 39:46.080]  sponsor.
[39:46.640 --> 39:50.240]  I love this is a brand new sponsor and it is a
[39:50.240 --> 39:51.120]  great app.
[39:51.120 --> 39:52.320]  It's called Boom.
[39:52.320 --> 39:54.320]  It's a Mac app from Global Delight.
[39:54.320 --> 39:56.240]  Have you ever wished that the audio playing
[39:56.240 --> 39:58.160]  through your Mac could be richer, crisper and
[39:58.160 --> 39:58.640]  just better?
[39:59.840 --> 40:02.480]  If you like listening to music, movies, videos
[40:02.480 --> 40:06.240]  through your Mac or any other audio, then you
[40:06.240 --> 40:08.560]  may have searched for ways to boost the volume
[40:08.560 --> 40:10.160]  on your Mac, but haven't found anything yet.
[40:10.160 --> 40:11.360]  Well, that's what Boom does.
[40:11.360 --> 40:13.680]  It's an amazing audio enhancer for the Mac.
[40:13.680 --> 40:14.640]  It is simple.
[40:14.640 --> 40:16.480]  It's gorgeous, has great looking UI.
[40:16.480 --> 40:18.880]  These guys at Global Delight have always, uh,
[40:18.880 --> 40:22.160]  uh, always done really, really high end, you
[40:22.160 --> 40:25.680]  know, classic indie Mac developer attention
[40:25.680 --> 40:28.400]  to detail and, and all the icons look great
[40:28.400 --> 40:29.200]  and everything like that.
[40:29.760 --> 40:32.720]  Um, so it's just a volume booster.
[40:32.720 --> 40:35.520]  That's it just works on a system wide level.
[40:35.520 --> 40:37.920]  So you don't have to, uh, install it like inside
[40:37.920 --> 40:38.720]  act apps.
[40:38.720 --> 40:40.080]  It's not a plugin or anything like that.
[40:40.640 --> 40:43.440]  Uh, and anything you play on your Mac suddenly
[40:43.440 --> 40:44.880]  sounds amplified.
[40:44.880 --> 40:47.200]  Uh, it works with headphones, it works with
[40:47.200 --> 40:51.280]  speakers, um, and, and the best part, this,
[40:51.280 --> 40:52.800]  it's a Mac world best of show winner.
[40:52.800 --> 40:54.960]  This is an app that has been renowned.
[40:54.960 --> 40:56.960]  It really, it, you know, it sounds almost like
[40:56.960 --> 40:58.400]  snake oil, but it really does work.
[40:58.400 --> 41:00.400]  And it's won the Mac world best of show back
[41:00.400 --> 41:01.920]  when Mac world was a show.
[41:03.520 --> 41:04.640]  And here's the best part.
[41:04.640 --> 41:06.640]  Anyway, I keep talking in circles here, but
[41:06.640 --> 41:08.720]  the best part is right now for a very limited
[41:08.720 --> 41:10.480]  period, I don't quite know how limited the
[41:10.480 --> 41:10.960]  period is.
[41:10.960 --> 41:12.320]  So if you hear it, you better go get it.
[41:12.320 --> 41:15.680]  Now it is 33% off in their store.
[41:15.680 --> 41:17.200]  It's just nine 99.
[41:17.200 --> 41:18.720]  It's usually 15 bucks.
[41:18.720 --> 41:20.240]  Uh, you, where do you go?
[41:20.240 --> 41:21.280]  Here's their URL.
[41:21.280 --> 41:22.320]  It's a bitly URL.
[41:22.320 --> 41:28.640]  So go to bit.ly bit.ly slash boom to Mac.
[41:28.640 --> 41:34.400]  That's the digit to bit.ly slash boom to Mac.
[41:34.400 --> 41:36.000]  And you will get more info.
[41:36.000 --> 41:37.680]  They have a seven day free trial.
[41:37.680 --> 41:39.840]  Can you believe that seven day free trial?
[41:39.840 --> 41:42.480]  What a it's like in the world of the app store.
[41:42.480 --> 41:43.840]  It's like you forget about free trials.
[41:43.840 --> 41:44.640]  Well, guess what?
[41:44.640 --> 41:46.880]  That's why the Mac is awesome.
[41:46.880 --> 41:47.920]  Seven day free trial.
[41:47.920 --> 41:51.200]  Try it, listen to it, see that you like it, and
[41:51.200 --> 41:53.280]  then you can get it for 33% off.
[41:53.280 --> 41:54.880]  That's boom two.
[41:54.880 --> 41:56.880]  That's the reason that two is in the URL.
[41:56.880 --> 41:58.000]  This is version two of the app.
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.160]  Boom to 33% off bit.ly slash boom to Mac.
[42:02.160 --> 42:02.880]  It's a great app.
[42:04.160 --> 42:09.280]  Um, we were talking before about the sort of,
[42:09.280 --> 42:13.040]  um, I don't know what you would call it, but
[42:13.040 --> 42:16.640]  the idea that Mac users are smug, insufferably
[42:16.640 --> 42:18.240]  smug on security issues.
[42:20.080 --> 42:22.880]  And that's another one that's sort of like a pet
[42:22.880 --> 42:28.640]  issue of mine is, is the incessant, inevitable
[42:28.640 --> 42:32.400]  need to boil everything down to a binary.
[42:33.040 --> 42:36.880]  It's either this or that either the Mac is
[42:36.880 --> 42:42.000]  completely invulnerable to malware and security
[42:42.000 --> 42:46.960]  exploits or the Mac is every bit as vulnerable
[42:46.960 --> 42:49.040]  and exploitable as every other system that's
[42:49.040 --> 42:49.680]  out there.
[42:49.680 --> 42:54.560]  Uh, when the truth is in between, it is nuanced,
[42:54.560 --> 42:55.840]  you know, and it was a lot.
[42:56.640 --> 42:57.520]  You still see it.
[42:57.520 --> 43:02.800]  And part of it is that iOS is so spectacularly
[43:02.800 --> 43:05.120]  popular and such a lucrative target.
[43:05.120 --> 43:09.200]  But in the old days, pre iPhone, it was always
[43:09.200 --> 43:14.080]  almost always boiled down to an argument that
[43:14.080 --> 43:16.320]  the Mac, you know, windows has all this malware
[43:16.320 --> 43:19.360]  problems, all these issues and, and all this,
[43:19.360 --> 43:21.280]  you know, the, the, and I don't even think it
[43:21.280 --> 43:21.920]  was snake oil.
[43:21.920 --> 43:23.760]  I think it was a reasonable thing that, you know,
[43:24.560 --> 43:27.360]  informed users would agree with was that it
[43:27.360 --> 43:32.800]  was considered a standard practice to install
[43:32.800 --> 43:35.520]  antivirus on your windows PC.
[43:35.520 --> 43:37.440]  That if you didn't, you were a fool and you
[43:37.440 --> 43:38.800]  were probably going to get exploited.
[43:38.800 --> 43:39.200]  Oh yeah.
[43:39.200 --> 43:40.720]  Remember when you'd install a virtual windows
[43:40.720 --> 43:43.120]  machine on your Mac and parallels, and then
[43:43.120 --> 43:44.800]  you'd launch it and it would get infected
[43:44.800 --> 43:46.480]  before you could install the antivirus software.
[43:46.480 --> 43:49.840]  It's no exaggeration.
[43:50.560 --> 43:54.800]  Uh, and then Mac users informed Mac users,
[43:54.800 --> 43:57.840]  uh, like myself would say, well, I, I, I don't
[43:57.840 --> 44:00.000]  run any antivirus on my Mac.
[44:00.000 --> 44:02.640]  And in fact, I recommend, I don't recommend
[44:02.640 --> 44:03.920]  my family members do.
[44:03.920 --> 44:05.600]  And I don't think you should either.
[44:06.160 --> 44:08.400]  Um, and I don't think you need to.
[44:08.400 --> 44:09.760]  And then they would say, well, you're an idiot
[44:09.760 --> 44:11.520]  because the only, the only reason the Mac
[44:11.520 --> 44:13.360]  doesn't get exploited is that it's, it's every
[44:13.360 --> 44:15.200]  bit as vulnerable as windows, but it's, it's
[44:15.200 --> 44:17.680]  too small for the malware people to care about.
[44:18.560 --> 44:20.240]  And it's like, you can't disprove that.
[44:20.240 --> 44:20.960]  That's one of those.
[44:20.960 --> 44:22.960]  It's like a, I don't know what the rhetorical
[44:22.960 --> 44:24.960]  or the description of that is, but it's a,
[44:24.960 --> 44:26.400]  it's sort of like a straw man argument.
[44:26.400 --> 44:27.200]  You can't knock it down.
[44:27.200 --> 44:28.720]  You can't disprove it.
[44:29.520 --> 44:31.840]  A hypothetical like that, right?
[44:31.840 --> 44:34.640]  There's no way to prove it otherwise, except
[44:34.640 --> 44:37.280]  if the Mac got as popular as windows.
[44:37.280 --> 44:39.920]  And that's sort of happened.
[44:39.920 --> 44:42.080]  That sort of happened with iOS, right?
[44:42.720 --> 44:45.280]  iOS has, you know, hundreds of millions, or
[44:45.280 --> 44:46.800]  I guess a billion active devices.
[44:47.440 --> 44:49.760]  Uh, there might be, now that I think about
[44:49.760 --> 44:51.920]  it, there might be more iOS devices in use
[44:51.920 --> 44:53.200]  than windows devices.
[44:53.200 --> 44:53.520]  I don't know.
[44:53.520 --> 44:54.480]  That might be ridiculous.
[44:54.480 --> 44:55.840]  But it's, I think there's more windows
[44:55.840 --> 44:57.200]  because windows things are never, there's
[44:57.200 --> 44:59.840]  like people running windows 95 someplace.
[44:59.840 --> 45:01.760]  So it's in the ballpark though, probably
[45:01.760 --> 45:03.360]  running air traffic control or something.
[45:04.560 --> 45:05.760]  It is in the ballpark.
[45:05.760 --> 45:09.520]  Uh, and it didn't happen.
[45:09.520 --> 45:11.600]  I mean, now there is malware for Mac.
[45:11.600 --> 45:13.680]  There is malware that attacks iOS, but
[45:13.680 --> 45:15.440]  it's never been as rampant a problem as
[45:15.440 --> 45:17.040]  it has been on other platforms.
[45:18.000 --> 45:21.600]  Yeah, it's, uh, I've always said, I
[45:21.600 --> 45:22.800]  shouldn't say always, but I've said
[45:22.800 --> 45:24.080]  increasingly, let's say as time goes by,
[45:24.080 --> 45:26.080]  I said increasingly, like Apple was a
[45:26.080 --> 45:27.680]  weird target and we had, we're the first
[45:27.680 --> 45:29.920]  viruses come to the computers, the first
[45:29.920 --> 45:31.360]  widespread, uh, the worms and things.
[45:31.360 --> 45:32.720]  It was through, uh, Macs, right?
[45:32.720 --> 45:34.400]  We had the, the one that you stuck a disk
[45:34.400 --> 45:35.520]  in, it would write it to the floppy disk.
[45:35.520 --> 45:35.920]  Yes.
[45:35.920 --> 45:38.320]  I was in my notes here.
[45:38.320 --> 45:40.080]  I do remember what do you remember?
[45:40.080 --> 45:43.280]  There was a time there was a time when
[45:43.280 --> 45:45.840]  I did run antivirus on my Mac and I did
[45:45.840 --> 45:46.880]  recommend everybody do it.
[45:46.880 --> 45:48.240]  It was called disinfectant.
[45:48.240 --> 45:50.960]  And it was awesome.
[45:50.960 --> 45:52.160]  Oh no, it was one guy.
[45:52.160 --> 45:54.160]  It was like a guy up in Seattle, right?
[45:54.720 --> 45:55.520]  Oh, you're so right.
[45:55.520 --> 45:57.040]  Cause did he charge for it?
[45:57.040 --> 45:57.920]  No, it was free.
[45:57.920 --> 45:59.360]  It was great.
[45:59.360 --> 46:00.560]  It was as good as the commercial
[46:00.560 --> 46:01.680]  solutions for a long time.
[46:01.680 --> 46:03.760]  John Norstead.
[46:03.760 --> 46:05.120]  Oh, wow.
[46:05.120 --> 46:05.760]  That's good memory.
[46:05.760 --> 46:06.560]  I think that's right.
[46:06.560 --> 46:07.360]  I'm very nice guy.
[46:07.360 --> 46:10.320]  If I recall to really nice guy, I mean,
[46:10.320 --> 46:14.880]  like, uh, it's just amazing that it was
[46:14.880 --> 46:16.400]  just, and it was this free utility.
[46:16.400 --> 46:18.720]  You did like an Annette, you would,
[46:18.720 --> 46:21.520]  uh, Norstead, John Norstead.
[46:21.520 --> 46:23.200]  I'm missing it sort of.
[46:23.200 --> 46:24.000]  Here's his homepage.
[46:24.000 --> 46:25.280]  John Norstead's homepage.
[46:25.280 --> 46:26.640]  Uh, there he is.
[46:26.640 --> 46:28.960]  Uh, I will put this in the show notes.
[46:28.960 --> 46:30.000]  John Norstead's homepage.
[46:30.720 --> 46:31.760]  It was amazing.
[46:31.760 --> 46:33.760]  Uh, you would, it was an init.
[46:33.760 --> 46:34.320]  You ran it.
[46:34.320 --> 46:36.320]  It didn't seemingly didn't slow
[46:36.320 --> 46:38.240]  your Mac down at all.
[46:38.240 --> 46:41.600]  It had no adverse effects and it was
[46:41.600 --> 46:44.160]  updated on a regular basis with all
[46:44.160 --> 46:46.800]  the new, uh, viruses that were spread
[46:46.800 --> 46:48.240]  around and it would identify them
[46:48.240 --> 46:49.040]  and block them.
[46:49.040 --> 46:50.480]  But yeah, that was like an insidious
[46:50.480 --> 46:50.640]  one.
[46:50.640 --> 46:53.120]  I remember we Drexel was absolutely
[46:53.120 --> 46:56.480]  hit by it was, um, it was, it was so
[46:56.480 --> 46:56.880]  insidious.
[46:56.880 --> 46:58.640]  It was a virus that would spread just
[46:58.640 --> 47:00.400]  by inserting a floppy disk into an
[47:00.400 --> 47:01.680]  already infected machine.
[47:01.680 --> 47:02.800]  Great piece of engineering for the
[47:02.800 --> 47:03.360]  day.
[47:03.360 --> 47:05.600]  Um, but yeah, but so here's my thing.
[47:05.600 --> 47:07.680]  So Apple didn't necessarily, they're
[47:07.680 --> 47:09.440]  never, Apple was never necessarily
[47:09.440 --> 47:11.120]  ahead on any innovation like address
[47:11.120 --> 47:13.680]  space, layout, randomization, ALSR,
[47:13.680 --> 47:15.920]  which is a great technique used so
[47:15.920 --> 47:17.520]  that you can't predictably as a
[47:17.520 --> 47:19.600]  malware developer, know where part
[47:19.600 --> 47:21.120]  of the system is going to be located
[47:21.120 --> 47:22.160]  in memory necessarily.
[47:22.160 --> 47:24.320]  And the more ASLR you do across
[47:24.320 --> 47:26.560]  everything, the harder it is to target
[47:26.560 --> 47:28.000]  a memory location and have something
[47:28.000 --> 47:28.560]  happen.
[47:28.560 --> 47:30.560]  And so that, you know, a window is, I
[47:30.560 --> 47:32.400]  want to say Microsoft introduced that
[47:32.400 --> 47:34.320]  years before and they needed to before
[47:34.320 --> 47:35.120]  OS 10.
[47:35.120 --> 47:36.640]  It was much more necessary, but so
[47:36.640 --> 47:38.160]  Apple wasn't necessarily an innovator
[47:38.160 --> 47:39.520]  in that what they were an innovator
[47:39.520 --> 47:42.480]  in was accidental things that worked,
[47:42.480 --> 47:42.800]  right?
[47:42.800 --> 47:46.080]  So, um, Apple going to free updates for
[47:46.080 --> 47:47.840]  its operating system, you know, first
[47:47.840 --> 47:50.480]  super cheap and then completely free
[47:50.480 --> 47:52.000]  and all the free incremental ones and
[47:52.000 --> 47:53.360]  the way in which you could do an
[47:53.360 --> 47:55.520]  incremental update in OS 10 without
[47:55.520 --> 47:56.880]  typically destroying your system.
[47:56.880 --> 47:58.000]  I know there were some bad releases
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.240]  and I had problems over the years, but
[48:00.240 --> 48:01.840]  they created an environment in which
[48:01.840 --> 48:03.760]  people were expected to run updates and
[48:03.760 --> 48:04.800]  typically stay up to date.
[48:04.800 --> 48:07.440]  You might've been, you know, using 10.6.8
[48:07.440 --> 48:09.600]  not 10.7 for a while, but then you'd
[48:09.600 --> 48:10.080]  switch over.
[48:10.080 --> 48:11.840]  And when you looked at over the years,
[48:11.840 --> 48:14.160]  as you looked at the adoption curve,
[48:14.160 --> 48:15.760]  it's ridiculous compared to any other
[48:15.760 --> 48:16.640]  operating system.
[48:16.640 --> 48:18.960]  These people move up so fast and
[48:18.960 --> 48:20.480]  software developers of course have the
[48:20.480 --> 48:22.160]  issue of compatibility and all that.
[48:22.160 --> 48:22.800]  That's one thing.
[48:22.800 --> 48:25.760]  So there are the long tail of older
[48:25.760 --> 48:28.320]  versions by number of people, uh,
[48:28.320 --> 48:30.400]  running a number of computers, rather
[48:30.400 --> 48:32.880]  of older versions of OS 10 is very small
[48:32.880 --> 48:34.000]  compared to most other things.
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.240]  You look at Android, Android, and there's
[48:36.240 --> 48:38.480]  this incredible distribution because
[48:38.480 --> 48:40.880]  Android devices, when they were sold
[48:40.880 --> 48:42.560]  originally, the first generations, as
[48:42.560 --> 48:45.840]  opposed to iOS, uh, it was very difficult
[48:45.840 --> 48:47.760]  or impossible to get beyond the version,
[48:47.760 --> 48:50.080]  even the subversion, like 2.2 that you
[48:50.080 --> 48:51.840]  had installed that gives you a great
[48:51.840 --> 48:53.360]  target because you know, there's going
[48:53.360 --> 48:54.720]  to be a hundred million devices out
[48:54.720 --> 48:56.800]  there running Android 2.2 for as long
[48:56.800 --> 48:58.000]  as the devices work.
[48:58.000 --> 48:59.840]  So you have that target to attack
[48:59.840 --> 49:02.800]  forever, Android, as opposed to OS 10
[49:02.800 --> 49:05.520]  or iOS, uh, didn't have a good pathway
[49:05.520 --> 49:06.560]  directly to users.
[49:06.560 --> 49:08.000]  I mean, Windows has this, of course,
[49:08.000 --> 49:08.960]  that's a direct pathway.
[49:08.960 --> 49:10.800]  And eventually it helped, uh, to provide
[49:10.800 --> 49:11.600]  security updates.
[49:11.600 --> 49:14.000]  So Android users are sort of abandoned
[49:14.000 --> 49:15.440]  and Google's been working on this for
[49:15.440 --> 49:17.120]  years to create an effective way to have
[49:17.120 --> 49:18.800]  a rapid turnaround for certain kinds of
[49:18.800 --> 49:19.920]  security issues.
[49:19.920 --> 49:22.080]  Switching to apps is one way.
[49:22.080 --> 49:24.480]  One of my colleagues over at Greenbot
[49:24.480 --> 49:26.800]  in the IDG family there, um, Flowion was
[49:26.800 --> 49:27.840]  telling me the other day that like
[49:27.840 --> 49:30.720]  Google having a messaging app, uh, you
[49:30.720 --> 49:31.680]  know, hangouts and mess,
[49:31.680 --> 49:32.880]  I forget what they call it, a messenger,
[49:32.880 --> 49:34.400]  um, they can update the app.
[49:34.400 --> 49:35.760]  If there's a security problem in the app,
[49:35.760 --> 49:37.200]  the app can take care of it, but they
[49:37.200 --> 49:38.800]  can't update the entire system because
[49:38.800 --> 49:40.080]  someone's running an outdated or
[49:40.080 --> 49:41.520]  unpatchable phone.
[49:41.520 --> 49:44.640]  So Apple, I think the upgrade cycle can
[49:44.640 --> 49:46.240]  always reduces the target of
[49:46.240 --> 49:48.400]  potential infections, whether it's with
[49:48.400 --> 49:50.640]  iOS, which is a monolithic, you know,
[49:50.640 --> 49:52.400]  ecosystem as opposed to Android, or it's
[49:52.400 --> 49:54.960]  with OS 10 where they push stuff out.
[49:54.960 --> 49:56.640]  And I think in a, it seems like a
[49:56.640 --> 49:58.320]  pretty fast, pretty fast way and get
[49:58.320 --> 49:59.360]  people up to the next version.
[49:59.360 --> 50:01.280]  So there's never a lot of people that
[50:01.280 --> 50:02.400]  you can easily target.
[50:02.400 --> 50:04.640]  And with windows, you have people running,
[50:04.640 --> 50:05.840]  uh, hundreds of millions of people
[50:05.840 --> 50:07.760]  running pre windows 10 versions.
[50:07.760 --> 50:09.040]  You have hundreds of millions of
[50:09.040 --> 50:10.480]  Android users, maybe several hundred
[50:10.480 --> 50:12.640]  million running pre marshmallow six
[50:12.640 --> 50:14.080]  point X versions, right?
[50:14.080 --> 50:16.720]  So those targets are so lovely that as
[50:16.720 --> 50:19.200]  a, if you're a malware developer and
[50:19.200 --> 50:20.800]  you're a criminal and you're trying to
[50:20.800 --> 50:22.240]  hit the biggest target, why would you
[50:22.240 --> 50:25.520]  do it for iOS or OS 10 if it's going to
[50:25.520 --> 50:27.520]  be hard or there aren't enough people?
[50:27.520 --> 50:29.840]  It's it's again, if you're doing that
[50:29.840 --> 50:31.840]  shotgun approach of, I want to do the
[50:31.840 --> 50:33.360]  least, I want to do the least amount of
[50:33.360 --> 50:36.640]  work and get my scummy little piece of
[50:36.640 --> 50:38.800]  malware on as many devices as possible.
[50:38.800 --> 50:40.080]  I'm going to send it a billion fishing
[50:40.080 --> 50:40.640]  messages.
[50:40.640 --> 50:42.080]  And I know that I'm going to catch of
[50:42.080 --> 50:43.600]  that, like a hundred million Android
[50:43.600 --> 50:44.480]  2.2 users.
[50:44.480 --> 50:45.120]  It's our owners.
[50:45.120 --> 50:46.800]  It's easy, relatively easy.
[50:46.800 --> 50:48.960]  Whereas if you want it, if you're in the
[50:48.960 --> 50:51.200]  business of targeting specific
[50:51.200 --> 50:52.640]  individuals at the behest of a
[50:52.640 --> 50:54.720]  government agency, you totally different.
[50:54.720 --> 50:54.960]  Yeah.
[50:54.960 --> 50:56.240]  I mean, look at the threat, you know, the
[50:56.240 --> 50:57.600]  hacking team that revealed how many
[50:57.600 --> 50:58.720]  different kinds of attacks that were
[50:58.720 --> 51:00.960]  against, uh, max and iOS.
[51:00.960 --> 51:02.160]  And it's a different category.
[51:02.160 --> 51:03.520]  It's something to be concerned about,
[51:03.520 --> 51:05.680]  but it's also things like Apple, uh,
[51:05.680 --> 51:07.040]  didn't have a native mail program for
[51:07.040 --> 51:07.600]  the longest time.
[51:07.600 --> 51:08.480]  Remember, and then they come out with
[51:08.480 --> 51:10.240]  mail and mail is kind of crappy, but it
[51:10.240 --> 51:12.480]  also, by the time Apple came out with
[51:12.480 --> 51:15.200]  own mail program for OS 10, um, there was
[51:15.200 --> 51:16.000]  already diversity.
[51:16.000 --> 51:17.680]  So you couldn't, as a malware author
[51:17.680 --> 51:20.800]  target, a specific popular mail programs
[51:20.800 --> 51:22.880]  problems, the mail programs weren't
[51:22.880 --> 51:24.080]  deeply integrated like they were in
[51:24.080 --> 51:24.480]  windows.
[51:24.480 --> 51:26.320]  So you couldn't cause like JavaScript
[51:26.320 --> 51:28.000]  to run an attached message without
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  someone clicking on it in Eudora or
[51:30.000 --> 51:30.400]  whatever.
[51:30.400 --> 51:30.960]  Right.
[51:30.960 --> 51:32.480]  And then when mail came out, Apple
[51:32.480 --> 51:33.600]  already knew this was a problem.
[51:33.600 --> 51:35.600]  So they engineered something that was
[51:35.600 --> 51:37.440]  less embedded in more separate.
[51:37.440 --> 51:38.560]  So you could still have stuff that would
[51:38.560 --> 51:41.360]  go wrong, but it was a more limited set
[51:41.360 --> 51:43.440]  of activities that happened with outlook
[51:43.440 --> 51:44.080]  and integration.
[51:44.080 --> 51:45.680]  I mean, Microsoft basically spent the
[51:45.680 --> 51:48.000]  last 20 years pulling out the hooks.
[51:48.000 --> 51:49.840]  It built deeply into its systems that
[51:49.840 --> 51:51.040]  allowed things to happen when they
[51:51.040 --> 51:52.560]  should have been sandboxed.
[51:52.560 --> 51:55.200]  We're so old that I specifically, you
[51:55.200 --> 51:56.640]  say that and it sounds,
[51:56.640 --> 52:01.040]  it sounds so old, max shipped without
[52:01.040 --> 52:02.000]  an email app.
[52:02.000 --> 52:04.000]  And they, and I had to double check.
[52:04.000 --> 52:05.760]  I knew that Apple didn't make one, but I
[52:05.760 --> 52:08.000]  was like, wait, did they maybe ship
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.400]  like Netscape's weirdo email or
[52:10.400 --> 52:10.720]  something?
[52:10.720 --> 52:12.000]  I was like, no, they didn't ship any of
[52:12.000 --> 52:12.320]  them.
[52:12.320 --> 52:15.600]  I didn't even the one, uh, I was Eudora
[52:15.600 --> 52:16.080]  user.
[52:16.080 --> 52:17.360]  Um, what came after that?
[52:17.360 --> 52:18.160]  I mean, it was outlook.
[52:18.160 --> 52:20.000]  I think I used outlook for a while in
[52:20.000 --> 52:21.040]  the office suite.
[52:21.040 --> 52:22.080]  I don't know if that was part of, was
[52:22.080 --> 52:23.920]  that part of the deal, the job, the jobs
[52:23.920 --> 52:26.400]  and, uh, and gates agree as part of the
[52:26.400 --> 52:29.360]  Microsoft investment that, um, Apple
[52:29.360 --> 52:30.800]  wasn't going to release its own mail
[52:30.800 --> 52:31.200]  software?
[52:31.200 --> 52:32.240]  No, no.
[52:32.240 --> 52:32.640]  Okay.
[52:32.640 --> 52:34.080]  Because that's, but outlook existed.
[52:34.080 --> 52:35.440]  So we put office or they didn't sell
[52:35.440 --> 52:36.560]  Eudora and there were a bunch of other
[52:36.560 --> 52:37.120]  mail programs.
[52:37.120 --> 52:38.320]  There's still a, there's still a
[52:38.320 --> 52:40.080]  remarkable number of email programs
[52:40.080 --> 52:42.080]  available and new ones being developed.
[52:42.080 --> 52:43.680]  I don't, I don't want to, I don't want
[52:43.680 --> 52:45.120]  to, I don't want to resort to Google
[52:45.120 --> 52:45.360]  here.
[52:45.360 --> 52:47.120]  I want either me or you to remember it.
[52:47.120 --> 52:51.280]  What was the one, uh, Jed Spencer's team
[52:51.280 --> 52:53.680]  created it and they went on to Microsoft
[52:53.680 --> 52:55.840]  and created the, the good version of
[52:55.840 --> 52:56.400]  outlook.
[52:56.400 --> 52:57.520]  And it wasn't note.
[52:57.520 --> 52:58.320]  What was it called?
[52:59.840 --> 53:01.280]  And I think I ever used that guy.
[53:01.280 --> 53:04.560]  Kawasaki was a big, uh, male meat.
[53:04.560 --> 53:05.600]  No, no.
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.080]  It was beloved by some people.
[53:10.080 --> 53:11.760]  Was it a Clara's product at one point
[53:11.760 --> 53:12.480]  even?
[53:12.480 --> 53:14.080]  Clara's had an email product, didn't
[53:14.080 --> 53:14.480]  it?
[53:14.480 --> 53:17.040]  I don't, you know, I'll tell you, I
[53:17.040 --> 53:18.160]  use Mailsmith today.
[53:18.160 --> 53:20.080]  I actually wrote a, you still do.
[53:20.080 --> 53:21.600]  I wrote a pro, I wrote an article for
[53:21.600 --> 53:23.040]  Mac world recently called
[53:23.040 --> 53:24.640]  old software that we all still use.
[53:24.640 --> 53:26.080]  And I got so many lovely comments from
[53:26.080 --> 53:26.640]  people
[53:26.640 --> 53:27.520]  chipping in with these.
[53:27.520 --> 53:29.440]  I use quick in 2007.
[53:29.440 --> 53:31.040]  I use Mailsmith, which is updated for
[53:31.040 --> 53:31.920]  compatibility.
[53:31.920 --> 53:34.720]  I use CSS edit from Mac rabbit, which
[53:34.720 --> 53:36.720]  doesn't develop anymore for doing CSS
[53:36.720 --> 53:37.440]  tweaking
[53:37.440 --> 53:38.480]  on live sites.
[53:38.480 --> 53:40.400]  I have this whole set of old software
[53:40.400 --> 53:41.840]  that's, that's still
[53:41.840 --> 53:43.680]  either getting tiny compatibility
[53:43.680 --> 53:45.680]  updates or manages to work under the
[53:45.680 --> 53:46.640]  current environment.
[53:46.640 --> 53:47.840]  And I'll cry when it stops.
[53:47.840 --> 53:49.360]  And people chimed in with all this
[53:49.360 --> 53:50.880]  software that they use that's
[53:50.880 --> 53:53.360]  sometimes like 10 plus years old that
[53:53.360 --> 53:54.400]  they've just been, you know,
[53:54.400 --> 53:57.840]  Levelator, Levelator, they upgraded it
[53:57.840 --> 53:59.760]  very nice to the people involved to
[53:59.760 --> 54:01.840]  be compatible with El Capitan.
[54:01.840 --> 54:03.840]  But Levelator, I don't think was really
[54:03.840 --> 54:05.120]  changed for several years.
[54:05.120 --> 54:07.040]  It's a vital piece of podcast,
[54:07.040 --> 54:08.640]  you know, audio normalization
[54:08.640 --> 54:10.240]  equalization software.
[54:10.240 --> 54:12.080]  All right, we hold the thought.
[54:12.080 --> 54:13.520]  I have, I did cheat.
[54:13.520 --> 54:15.280]  I googled and I went to judge
[54:15.280 --> 54:18.080]  Spencer's LinkedIn page.
[54:18.080 --> 54:20.880]  It was Fog City software.
[54:20.880 --> 54:21.440]  Yes.
[54:21.440 --> 54:24.080]  And the product was called emailer.
[54:24.080 --> 54:26.000]  And then it was purchased by Apple in
[54:26.000 --> 54:27.600]  March 1996 and became
[54:27.600 --> 54:29.120]  Claris emailer.
[54:29.120 --> 54:31.840]  So Apple owned it because Apple owns or
[54:31.840 --> 54:33.360]  I guess Claris doesn't exist anymore.
[54:33.360 --> 54:34.480]  And I guess it's file maker.
[54:34.480 --> 54:36.320]  It was like spun out and summit was
[54:36.320 --> 54:37.200]  spun in.
[54:37.200 --> 54:39.440]  Apple owned the email client, but didn't
[54:39.440 --> 54:40.560]  pre-install it on Mac.
[54:40.560 --> 54:41.680]  Oh my God.
[54:41.680 --> 54:43.520]  I know because because and the whole
[54:43.520 --> 54:47.600]  point was that until the,
[54:47.600 --> 54:49.440]  you know, again, I've, I've long said
[54:49.440 --> 54:52.080]  that to me, there's really only
[54:52.080 --> 54:53.520]  two eras at Apple.
[54:53.520 --> 54:57.440]  There was the original era up and then
[54:57.440 --> 54:59.040]  starting with the next reunification.
[54:59.040 --> 55:01.280]  That's like modern Apple, modern Apple
[55:01.280 --> 55:04.800]  started with the next reunification
[55:04.800 --> 55:06.080]  and jobs coming back.
[55:06.080 --> 55:07.840]  And that's, there's so many things that
[55:07.840 --> 55:08.240]  were different.
[55:08.240 --> 55:10.640]  But in the, in the original Apple,
[55:10.640 --> 55:12.640]  it was, it was like explicit.
[55:12.640 --> 55:14.080]  It wasn't even implicit.
[55:14.080 --> 55:17.120]  I think Apple was explicit about it at
[55:17.120 --> 55:20.240]  times that they didn't want to compete
[55:20.240 --> 55:22.960]  with third party developers.
[55:22.960 --> 55:26.080]  And so the Mac, you know, it would have,
[55:26.080 --> 55:27.840]  it had like, uh, what was it called back
[55:27.840 --> 55:28.080]  then?
[55:28.080 --> 55:32.320]  Simple text, teach text, which was the
[55:32.320 --> 55:32.880]  iconic.
[55:32.880 --> 55:34.080]  I remember now, I think I remember
[55:34.080 --> 55:35.280]  simple text, but I think that was later.
[55:35.280 --> 55:35.760]  I think you're right.
[55:35.760 --> 55:37.840]  Teach, teach text was like the built-in
[55:37.840 --> 55:39.200]  read me reader.
[55:39.200 --> 55:41.360]  Um, but it's super minimal.
[55:41.360 --> 55:43.600]  I mean, way less, way more minimal
[55:43.600 --> 55:45.360]  feature, minimally featured even than
[55:45.360 --> 55:47.520]  text edit today, because they just
[55:47.520 --> 55:48.240]  about text edit.
[55:48.240 --> 55:49.680]  Cause text that it actually has its
[55:49.680 --> 55:51.040]  roots right in next.
[55:51.040 --> 55:51.200]  Yeah.
[55:51.200 --> 55:53.600]  I mean, that is basically, and text
[55:53.600 --> 55:54.960]  edit is a great piece of software.
[55:54.960 --> 55:55.760]  No one uses.
[55:55.760 --> 55:57.360]  And I wrote a macro piece about how
[55:57.360 --> 55:58.960]  great there's some features in it that
[55:58.960 --> 56:00.560]  are invaluable that you can basically
[56:00.560 --> 56:03.120]  cannot easily get in any other people
[56:03.120 --> 56:03.760]  do use it.
[56:03.760 --> 56:05.280]  I, there are, it's sort of like a secret
[56:05.280 --> 56:07.360]  cult of people who love and, and rightly
[56:07.360 --> 56:10.640]  so, uh, uh, text edit, including people
[56:10.640 --> 56:11.120]  at Apple.
[56:11.120 --> 56:12.560]  I remember I had a meeting at Apple
[56:13.440 --> 56:15.280]  over a decade ago when I was at joint,
[56:15.280 --> 56:16.320]  it had nothing to do with during
[56:16.320 --> 56:16.800]  fireball.
[56:16.800 --> 56:18.240]  It was, you know, Apple wanted to
[56:18.960 --> 56:20.960]  meet with us and talk about joints,
[56:20.960 --> 56:22.480]  technology and blah, blah, blah.
[56:22.480 --> 56:25.680]  And, uh, I noticed that the, uh, it was
[56:25.680 --> 56:27.120]  the first time actually I met Michael
[56:27.120 --> 56:29.840]  Lop in person, friends and repose.
[56:29.840 --> 56:30.880]  He was there.
[56:30.880 --> 56:32.480]  He was an Apple software manager at
[56:32.480 --> 56:32.960]  the time.
[56:32.960 --> 56:34.800]  Um, and so we didn't know each other.
[56:34.800 --> 56:35.600]  We weren't friends yet.
[56:35.600 --> 56:37.680]  Um, but we were, you know, online.
[56:38.480 --> 56:39.760]  I had a little bit of back and forth
[56:39.760 --> 56:41.280]  simply as, you know, he knew Darren
[56:41.280 --> 56:41.680]  fireball.
[56:41.680 --> 56:43.040]  I knew ransom repose.
[56:43.040 --> 56:45.200]  He comes into the meeting and of course
[56:45.200 --> 56:47.120]  he's a very, you know, he's such a
[56:47.120 --> 56:47.920]  minimalist.
[56:47.920 --> 56:50.080]  He opens up his, his, I don't know if
[56:50.080 --> 56:51.200]  it was, he might've even been a power
[56:51.200 --> 56:52.560]  book at the time, but whatever, you know,
[56:52.560 --> 56:54.480]  Mac book, power book, of course, there's
[56:54.480 --> 56:55.280]  nothing on screen.
[56:55.280 --> 56:56.720]  It's just a beautiful desktop picture.
[56:57.920 --> 57:00.160]  He launches text edit and he's got one
[57:00.160 --> 57:01.520]  window on screen and it's text.
[57:01.520 --> 57:03.280]  And that's the app he used to take notes
[57:03.280 --> 57:03.840]  for the meeting.
[57:03.840 --> 57:06.000]  And I was kind of blown away, but also
[57:06.000 --> 57:06.960]  not surprised at all.
[57:06.960 --> 57:08.320]  And he was like, oh, of course I, cause
[57:08.320 --> 57:10.000]  he, and he said, you know why I use this
[57:10.000 --> 57:10.240]  app?
[57:10.240 --> 57:12.480]  I use this app because it is super simple
[57:12.480 --> 57:14.480]  and it has never once crashed on me.
[57:14.480 --> 57:16.800]  I've never lost a single letter of
[57:16.800 --> 57:18.880]  anything I've ever typed in text edit.
[57:20.880 --> 57:22.400]  I think this is still the case in Japan.
[57:22.400 --> 57:23.920]  I don't know, but in Japan, it used to be
[57:23.920 --> 57:25.200]  the less on your business card, the more
[57:25.200 --> 57:26.240]  important you were.
[57:26.240 --> 57:27.520]  And then at least in the eighties, I
[57:27.520 --> 57:28.720]  remember seeing a cartoon about this and
[57:28.720 --> 57:29.680]  reading about this.
[57:29.680 --> 57:30.800]  And you know, you, when you hand someone
[57:30.800 --> 57:32.000]  a business card, Japan, you hold it with
[57:32.000 --> 57:33.520]  two hands and you hand it to them.
[57:33.520 --> 57:34.560]  It's just, you know, it's got a little
[57:34.560 --> 57:35.520]  bit of a ceremony about it.
[57:35.520 --> 57:36.720]  Used to, I have no idea what people do
[57:36.720 --> 57:37.200]  today.
[57:37.200 --> 57:38.480]  And there was a comic strip at the time
[57:38.480 --> 57:39.680]  by an alt cartoonist.
[57:39.680 --> 57:41.440]  It was about these two people competing
[57:41.440 --> 57:43.760]  for a job in Japan and striving to be
[57:43.760 --> 57:44.240]  whatever.
[57:44.240 --> 57:45.200]  And one of them has a dream.
[57:45.200 --> 57:46.560]  He says, I dreamt, I meant God.
[57:46.560 --> 57:48.080]  And he handed me his business card and
[57:48.080 --> 57:49.440]  it was completely blank.
[57:49.440 --> 57:50.480]  That's what I'm thinking about when you're
[57:50.480 --> 57:51.600]  talking about Michael Law.
[57:51.600 --> 57:52.000]  Right.
[57:52.880 --> 57:54.640]  So Apple had an email product and they
[57:54.640 --> 57:55.840]  didn't even pre-install it.
[57:55.840 --> 57:57.360]  I don't think maybe they did at some
[57:57.360 --> 57:57.600]  point.
[57:58.720 --> 57:58.880]  Yeah.
[57:58.880 --> 58:00.320]  So nothing bundled, you know, they, they
[58:00.320 --> 58:02.160]  kept their hands off and Microsoft
[58:02.160 --> 58:05.680]  integration, bundling, tying, monopoly-ish
[58:05.680 --> 58:08.080]  tendencies, always keeping this market
[58:08.080 --> 58:09.520]  locked in for themselves, whether it's
[58:09.520 --> 58:12.080]  business software, productivity issues,
[58:12.080 --> 58:14.880]  email, browser, that was their security
[58:14.880 --> 58:15.440]  downfall.
[58:15.440 --> 58:17.120]  And I think they spent a lot of time
[58:17.120 --> 58:18.240]  backing away from that.
[58:18.240 --> 58:18.800]  And okay.
[58:18.800 --> 58:19.920]  Oh, so I just did this story.
[58:19.920 --> 58:20.960]  I don't know if this is a sidebar.
[58:20.960 --> 58:22.160]  We're still talking viruses.
[58:22.160 --> 58:24.080]  I just did a piece that should be out by
[58:24.080 --> 58:26.320]  the time this airs for MIT Technology
[58:26.320 --> 58:27.680]  Review about some new research.
[58:27.680 --> 58:29.520]  It's not, it's been public for months.
[58:29.520 --> 58:30.960]  A couple of research teams at different
[58:30.960 --> 58:32.960]  universities came up with strategies for
[58:32.960 --> 58:34.640]  fighting ransomware on Windows.
[58:34.640 --> 58:35.840]  And it was very interesting.
[58:35.840 --> 58:36.800]  And I talked to a bunch of, you know,
[58:36.800 --> 58:39.520]  talked to McAfee and other folks and the
[58:39.520 --> 58:40.960]  researchers and the thing that's hilarious
[58:40.960 --> 58:42.240]  say, well, how do you stop ransomware?
[58:42.240 --> 58:43.280]  What's, you know, what are you doing?
[58:43.280 --> 58:44.720]  They're like, well, you keep your software
[58:44.720 --> 58:45.200]  up to date.
[58:45.200 --> 58:47.200]  You install, you know, you run the latest
[58:47.200 --> 58:48.640]  patches, you don't run Java, you don't
[58:48.640 --> 58:48.960]  run flash.
[58:48.960 --> 58:50.800]  I'm like, wait, what about virus software?
[58:50.800 --> 58:52.400]  They're like, that's sort of the last
[58:52.400 --> 58:55.040]  stage, like ransomware and most malware
[58:55.040 --> 58:57.200]  now just targets this incredibly low
[58:57.200 --> 58:59.040]  hanging fruit of which there still remains
[58:59.040 --> 58:59.520]  so much.
[58:59.520 --> 59:01.200]  Like, so one of the people I spoke to
[59:01.200 --> 59:03.360]  said something like 50% of machines you
[59:03.360 --> 59:05.680]  can just get into because they're just
[59:05.680 --> 59:07.120]  not protected in any way.
[59:07.120 --> 59:09.280]  Forget antivirus software.
[59:10.080 --> 59:11.760]  What the ransomware, what's interesting
[59:11.760 --> 59:13.600]  is the developers of these, these
[59:13.600 --> 59:14.880]  academics rather, the two different
[59:14.880 --> 59:16.320]  groups took different approaches.
[59:16.320 --> 59:18.480]  But the fact is ransomware, it works on
[59:18.480 --> 59:19.680]  user space files.
[59:19.680 --> 59:21.040]  So it's actually insidious.
[59:21.040 --> 59:22.480]  You don't have to gain deep permissions.
[59:22.480 --> 59:24.640]  Once the payload is dropped and it runs,
[59:24.640 --> 59:26.000]  you know, a lot of ransomware is like
[59:26.000 --> 59:29.040]  scripts, like PHP or JavaScript, and you
[59:29.040 --> 59:31.280]  double click a Trojan horse that's
[59:31.280 --> 59:32.640]  delivered via email.
[59:32.640 --> 59:34.240]  And it just starts encrypting files
[59:34.240 --> 59:35.840]  because it doesn't need extra permission.
[59:35.840 --> 59:36.080]  Right.
[59:36.080 --> 59:37.360]  It can, it's, they're your files.
[59:37.360 --> 59:39.120]  So they're only doing documents, but
[59:39.120 --> 59:40.480]  there's a lot of tell tales, there's
[59:40.480 --> 59:42.160]  entropy and all kinds of other stuff
[59:42.160 --> 59:42.800]  that can monitor.
[59:42.800 --> 59:44.320]  So the approaches are really cool.
[59:44.320 --> 59:46.160]  But I was like, oh, that's one reason
[59:46.160 --> 59:47.760]  ransomware has a money thing at the end,
[59:47.760 --> 59:49.280]  which is very straightforward.
[59:50.080 --> 59:53.040]  And there's like 6 million unique variants
[59:53.040 --> 59:55.440]  of ransomware out there now because the
[59:55.440 --> 59:57.440]  modifications of a bunch of like base
[59:57.440 --> 59:59.360]  families of ransomware, so many different
[59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.560]  people are doing it because the money
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:01.120]  is so easy.
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:03.440]  But fundamentally, it has that great
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:03.920]  advantage.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.280]  It's not trying to get into your kernel
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:05.920]  and do something.
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.520]  It's not trying to hijack your
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.240]  networking.
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.600]  It's just trying to take your word
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.200]  documents and make them unreadable.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:11.520]  Right.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.040]  It's not really fighting the system.
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.240]  It's actually going with the flow of
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:14.720]  the system.
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.320]  Oh, you're something the user double
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:17.760]  click, you could, you have access to all
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:18.960]  of the user's files.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:19.600]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:20.800]  It's in your, you know, my documents,
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:21.280]  boom, you're done.
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:23.040]  Well, and it's exactly the sort of thing.
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.480]  It's exactly the sort of reason that
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:27.600]  Apple is, you know, sandboxed iOS from
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.640]  the start and is so, for all the, the
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:33.680]  the, the technical problems it causes
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:39.280]  for honest apps, why they're so bent
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.360]  towards sandboxing on Mac as well.
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.240]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.440]  And I hear that there's, there's a
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.720]  technique I learned that I didn't know
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:44.960]  about.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.640]  There's a micro virtualization that's
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:46.880]  coming.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.720]  It's a step beyond sandboxing.
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.960]  Every app runs essentially in its own
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:54.000]  tiny virtual machine, which sounds crazy,
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.480]  but Bromium, a B-R-O-M-I-E-M is one of
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:57.600]  the companies in the space.
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.240]  I think, uh, was it, uh, F-Secure may
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.320]  has a product, um, it's the new thing
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:04.400]  because a lot of business users are
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.920]  basically only running a handful of
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.240]  apps.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.600]  So running them in the, in the virtual
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.040]  environments are transparent to you as
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:09.840]  a user,
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.760]  but essentially it's like super
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:12.800]  sandboxing.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:13.520]  Right.
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:14.640]  It's wild.
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.000]  Uh, did you see the story?
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.120]  I linked to it.
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.720]  I guess I'll put it in the show notes.
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.560]  Uh, I linked to it earlier this week
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:23.920]  or maybe last week where there was
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:27.040]  there's a variant of ransomware that
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:29.680]  doesn't actually
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.440]  after you pay them, it doesn't give you
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:32.800]  your files.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.400]  So the way for anybody who doesn't know
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.680]  the way ransomware works, your machine
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.040]  gets hit by ransomware.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.280]  The, the, the ransomware malware starts
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.880]  running and it starts encrypting your
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.400]  files and then all of a sudden
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.160]  you're going, you notice it when you go
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.360]  to open one of your
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.480]  documents and it gives you a dialogue
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.600]  and it says you've been,
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:52.240]  you know, you've been hit by ransomware.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.680]  All of your files are encrypted and
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:54.960]  they really are encrypted.
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.880]  And so like if you like go try to open
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.720]  it and, you know, a text editor or
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.160]  something that's just going to be,
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.720]  you know, garbled binary stuff because
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:03.520]  it's encrypted.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.040]  Right, and the key is sent via command
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.400]  and control system. That's the one. It
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.840]  does need a little network access so
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.600]  the key is not stored on the device so
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.360]  you can't just extract the keys.
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.600]  Yeah, so there's some clever, you know,
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:16.720]  use of encryption there and then if you
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.960]  give them money by following steps x, y,
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.320]  and z, who knows, you know, maybe they
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.080]  want bitcoin. You have to go buy bitcoin
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.920]  and then give them the bitcoin or,
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.280]  you know, or they just want your credit
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.120]  card number or whatever.
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.640]  Somehow you've got to get the money
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.920]  and then you give them money and then
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.760]  they really do decrypt, you know, they
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.520]  give you the key and you get your files
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.160]  back.
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.600]  And there have been cases, high-profile
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.440]  cases, there was, I remember there was a
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:39.200]  hospital, I think in Los Angeles,
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.960]  a hospital that got hit by ransomware
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:44.480]  and they spent $17,000, I think,
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:46.320]  unencrypted. They had to but, you know,
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.960]  they, you know, and there's sort of a,
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.120]  you know, it's like an old, almost like a
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.320]  political thing that, you know, like the
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.440]  United States government doesn't
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.800]  negotiate with terrorists.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.080]  And if that's your policy, if you just
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:57.520]  state that as your policy upfront, we
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.120]  don't negotiate with
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:02.160]  with terrorists, it hopefully acts as a
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:04.160]  deterrent to terrorists who would,
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:07.280]  you know, take people, take U.S.,
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.040]  you know, take people hostage because
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.560]  they, you know, now it's not really true
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:11.760]  that we don't negotiate with them but
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:12.960]  it's the policy. And you can see the
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:13.840]  logic of that.
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.120]  And you can see the logic of, well, you
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.960]  should never pay these people for this.
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.640]  But at a certain point it might have
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.480]  been worth it for, if it was critical
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.000]  enough information, it might be worth it
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.320]  for you to pay whatever the price, that
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:26.000]  the price they're asking, however
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.920]  distasteful it is to actually give in
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.200]  and give these
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.920]  literal criminals money, it might be more
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.440]  valuable to you, you know,
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:35.280]  than the, you know, the actual data that's
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.880]  been encrypted
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:40.320]  is more valuable. Now the funny thing is
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:41.440]  that
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:45.440]  there's a group, there's a group that
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.280]  you give them the money and I'm laughing
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.960]  but it's terrible because it's
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:51.200]  it's even worse, obviously. But the thing
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.480]  that makes me,
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.480]  it makes me laugh about it is that all
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:58.480]  of the, and all of the honest ransomware,
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:00.800]  and I, it's so funny to say that the
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.560]  honest crooks
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:04.640]  have got to be furious about this
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.800]  because if word spreads that even if you
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.240]  pay you don't get your files back it's
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:09.840]  going to make people less likely to pay.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.200]  I have so many things to say about this.
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.960]  Can I say a few things? So many,
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.560]  because I spent several days working on
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:17.600]  this recently. So, okay, so you know how
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:19.600]  ship ransoming works, like piracy, Somali
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:21.440]  pirates, right? Money, Planet Money did a
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.080]  great
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.680]  piece about this and it talked to one of
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.920]  the people who does negotiation with
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:26.720]  pirates
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:29.440]  to pay their ransom, right? If you start
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:30.960]  killing the hostages,
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.920]  piracy stops working. So it's actually
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:36.880]  typically not dangerous to be taken
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:40.000]  captive by pirates, Somalian or whomever,
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.080]  because it is entirely in the interest
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:43.920]  of the economic system to
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.480]  to negotiate a reasonable fee, make sure
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:48.000]  all the hostages are unharmed,
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.360]  they will even sometimes release people
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.960]  for medical or compassionate reasons,
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.800]  like it's handled like a business.
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.400]  Then you have the situation where, I
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.600]  can't remember how long ago this was now,
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.400]  a couple years,
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.760]  where some pirates started killing
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.600]  people and then it was like okay and all
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.960]  the navies in the world went
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:02.880]  screw this and they start steaming navy
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.480]  ships in and sort of clean up the
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.680]  problem, which has been a commercial
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:06.880]  problem and is now,
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:09.280]  you know, a human rights one, right? And
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.480]  I'm thinking
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:13.280]  the idiots who think it's funny to delete
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.960]  the files or they're too incompetent,
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:15.920]  whatever it is,
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.360]  they have so many, I mean there are so
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:19.440]  many angry organized criminals in the
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:20.240]  world.
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.760]  They're, these guys could get killed
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.120]  honestly if they're tracked down, that's
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:24.560]  for sure, so that's not funny, but it's
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:25.200]  also
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.520]  like it actually does exactly that.
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.440]  It's almost like a disruptive technique
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.800]  that would, that destroys the value of
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:31.680]  ransomware.
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:34.640]  So in researching this story, I came
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.800]  across just a few days ago, F-Secure
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.440]  released this hilarious white paper. They
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:41.200]  tested the customer service of major
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.320]  ransomware packages.
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.160]  They're like, it has a customer service
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.840]  burden. I talked to this guy named Sean
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:50.000]  Sullivan at F-Secure Labs about
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.360]  some background stuff about ransomware
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:52.480]  and he said
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:54.320]  the reason it's gotten so popular is
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.160]  it's Tor, you know, the routing network
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.080]  that lets you do anonymized browsing.
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.240]  That's how the ransomware people post
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.520]  websites basically
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.600]  and Bitcoin, it's all Bitcoin, there's no
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:04.960]  credit card anymore. That's the big
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:05.920]  change.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.680]  Ransomware dates back literally decades
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:10.080]  but this is the, Bitcoin just makes it,
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.560]  it facilitates it so much. The average
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.080]  ransomware
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.680]  demand now has gone up from a few hundred
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.040]  dollars worth of Bitcoin to like
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.120]  600 something dollars, but F-Secure
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:20.560]  found you could negotiate with some of
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.240]  them. They'll run the fee down. They
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.760]  created like a naive user
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.840]  who then, they hired somebody who was
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:26.800]  not technical
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:28.160]  to do the communication so they wouldn't
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.520]  give anything away about, you know, what
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.240]  they ate about
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.000]  more sophisticated details and they
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.600]  tested all these. You can extend the
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.440]  deadlines. Customer service people
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:36.800]  at the ransomware companies are very
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:38.640]  sensitive. In one case they're like, this
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:39.840]  was as good as like real
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.200]  customer service. It's like what you'd
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.120]  get from a software company. They talked
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.320]  you through it. They'll often teach you
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.760]  how to buy Bitcoin
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:47.360]  so that you can pay. They treat it like
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.040]  a real customer service burden, like it's
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:49.760]  a business and
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:51.280]  we're here to help you get your files
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:53.760]  back. So if you think about it,
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.080]  when do you typically get the best
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.280]  customer service?
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.680]  Typically you get better customer
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:00.480]  service
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.040]  before you've given them your money.
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.880]  Right? You get,
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:07.040]  you know, it's easier and you
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.680]  wait less time to talk to a salesperson
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:11.120]  before you've bought something than when
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.040]  you come back with a problem.
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.560]  Yeah, it's just the whole thing is
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:15.760]  hilarious. I mean it's hilarious and
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.280]  awful. So Mac users, you know, there's been
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:18.640]  a couple ransomware attempt,
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:20.560]  software attempts against Mac users. And
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.400]  again, because the userware or user
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:22.880]  space
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:26.480]  file issue, it's possible we will see
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:28.960]  you know phishing style ransomware or
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.320]  things that will be minimally capable
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:31.120]  because
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:34.080]  OS X will execute certain kinds of
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:34.560]  things.
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.080]  The question is your network access and
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:37.600]  some privilege it may need would be
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.120]  harder. There might need to be an exploit
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.480]  pathway for a little bit of it,
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:43.520]  but it is so much less of a burden to
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.160]  get to have some effect. So we'll see.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.760]  So hopefully it won't affect
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.680]  most of us, but it is. And again, it's,
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.120]  you know, everything they're saying, it's
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:51.440]  like
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.360]  update your software, use patches, make
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.360]  backups, having good backups.
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:57.920]  You know, I use Backblaze and CrashPlan
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:58.800]  and local
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.600]  clones and I have a deep archive. So if I
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:03.200]  have all my files were
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:05.360]  encrypted today, I have a hundred percent
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:06.560]  of those on
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:08.800]  most of them on Dropbox also and in two
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:10.240]  other, like at least one other place I
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.040]  should say
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.720]  where I have a deep archive and I could
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:15.520]  go back to a pre-encrypted release.
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:17.200]  Let me take a break here. Thank our
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.360]  next sponsor. This is a longtime
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:20.320]  friend of the show,
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:23.600]  longtime sponsor, Fracture. Fracture is a
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.520]  photo decor company that is out to
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:26.080]  rescue
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.240]  your favorite images from the digital
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:29.120]  ether.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:32.160]  They print your photos directly onto
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:32.720]  glass
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:35.520]  and add a laser cut rigid backing so
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.800]  they are ready to display
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:38.480]  right out of the box. It's not like a
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:41.120]  piece of paper glued to a piece of glass.
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:44.160]  They print the photo right on the glass.
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:45.840]  They've been a sponsor for years. I still
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:47.280]  haven't seen anybody else that does this.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.400]  Maybe it's somebody else. I think that
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:49.840]  Fracture's got all this proprietary
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:50.880]  stuff down there.
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.760]  It is an amazing display. I've
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:55.440]  always said it is very much
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:58.400]  like the way that the retina displays
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:58.800]  once
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.720]  Apple started fusing the screens to the
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.320]  glass where it looks like the pixels are
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:03.920]  on the glass instead of behind a layer
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:04.560]  of glass.
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.000]  That's what Fracture photos look like
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.760]  except they're completely analog.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:10.960]  It is a great thing to do with
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.720]  your digital photos. I have thousands. I
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.800]  shoot thousands of photos every year
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:16.800]  and the ones that I like best, I get
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:18.160]  them printed on these fractures, hang
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:19.840]  them up around the house.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.120]  That's what people used to do because
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.280]  your photos were printed. You'd go, you'd
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:25.120]  shoot photos, you'd get them back from
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.640]  the photo lab, you'd take the ones you
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:29.040]  like out, you know, the real keepers.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.480]  Instead of just putting them back
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:31.520]  in the envelope, you'd put them in a
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:33.120]  frame, hang them up.
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.040]  We don't do that anymore because there's
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.400]  like this extra step where you got to
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:37.120]  get them from
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.200]  your digital archive to being on. This is
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:40.240]  the way to do it. If you're going to
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:41.920]  print your photos, take the keepers and
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.840]  send them to Fracture. They're so good.
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:47.440]  They have so many sizes, amazing sizes.
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:50.640]  They have a 60 day happiness guarantee
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:52.080]  so that you're sure to love your order.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.160]  Each fracture is handmade
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:56.800]  in Gainesville, Florida from U.S. sourced
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:57.840]  materials
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:00.720]  in their carbon neutral factory. All
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:02.560]  happens in the U.S.
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:05.440]  So for more information and 10% off your

[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:16.320]  the name
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:18.480]  not the name of your podcast because
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:19.840]  I'll tell you if they did put that note
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:20.560]  in here I
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:21.840]  would have said

[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:24.960]  that's not it. Remember this. It's

[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:30.160]  you to do when you place your order
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:31.200]  they're going to say where did you hear
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:31.920]  about this?
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:33.520]  Just mention that you heard it from the
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:34.960]  talk show and they'll know that you came
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:35.760]  from here.
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:38.960]  It's literally it is a one
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.400]  question survey.
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.640]  Where does you hear about Fracture? So it
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:44.400]  is the easiest survey you will ever take.
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:45.680]  Just remember to tell them
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:47.120]  that helps support the show and it's

[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:53.120]  slash podcast.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.920]  Can I talk? You can do whatever you
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:56.560]  want.
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.640]  Well a brief another this is like
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:10:59.840]  this isn't a sidebar you were writing
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:00.960]  recently about
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.720]  Amazon and its inventory of the
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:04.640]  Birkenstock story. That's on my list of
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.920]  topics. Oh good well I have something to
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:07.120]  say about that but we can go
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.360]  take your direction. I don't I think I
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:10.720]  think we were done with security so we
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.480]  can totally go on to Amazon fraud.
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.400]  I've linked just to a couple of recent
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.160]  stories about
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:19.120]  so terrible so there's a couple of
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:20.480]  aspects to it. One
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.880]  is the the main one that I've been
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.320]  reading because it seems like it's a
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:28.240]  little bit new is is big brands
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.280]  being ripped off by
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:33.760]  mostly Chinese counterfeiters and then
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:36.000]  they sell these things through Amazon.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.480]  Well the first one I heard this is
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:39.760]  maybe two years ago
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.880]  is that mophie products mophie the
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:45.280]  battery maker they make a whole bunch of
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:47.120]  battery external battery packs and
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.720]  battery cases for
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:52.640]  for phones. A really interesting company
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.560]  I have a couple of their things and
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:57.520]  I really I have to say I like them a lot
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:59.040]  I have a battery
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.640]  I like the instead of a case I like to
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:02.160]  just have the battery
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.880]  pack and they make one that has built-in
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:06.640]  lightning and USB cable so you don't
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:07.440]  need to take
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:09.440]  cables you don't need to have an extra
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:11.200]  cable. I really like that product a lot
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:12.560]  it's my favorite external battery thing
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:13.200]  ever
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:15.680]  but I heard years ago just like at least
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:16.560]  two years ago
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.520]  don't buy mophie stuff on Amazon because
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:20.960]  there's so much Chinese
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.800]  knockoff crap that looks like a mophie
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.800]  product but it's really substandard
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.800]  electronics the batteries are no good
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:29.600]  they're just crummy products. If you
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.520]  google like mophie Amazon you'll find
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:32.800]  lots of hits about it.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.320]  So now just recently this week
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:36.160]  Birkenstock the
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:37.680]  sandals what else do they make just
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.600]  sandals and flip-flops I guess much stuff
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.040]  I was called by the way I was called
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.640]  socks and sandals in college because of
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.640]  my Birkenstock habits
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.160]  just so you know I went to school in the
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.360]  east grew up in the west that's how it
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.520]  goes
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:52.160]  uh is pulling out of Amazon on January
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:53.200]  I guess they had they can't do it
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.400]  immediately because they might have
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.080]  contracts or inventory or something big
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.160]  but they're so overrun by
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:12:59.680]  counterfeiters on Amazon that they're
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:00.880]  pulling out
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:01.760]  oh yeah and you and you love them
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:02.240]  they're like
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:04.080]  Amazon basically told them if you want
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:06.160]  to be sell every single thing you sell
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:07.920]  then we will fight counterfeiting I mean
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:08.880]  I'm paraphrasing
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.080]  and if you want to just sell the way
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.840]  you're doing then screw you I mean they
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:12.960]  didn't say it that way but that's the
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.000]  effect that's you know
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.840]  that's what Birkenstock claims at least
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:19.200]  I think I could be wrong on this I've
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.680]  I wrote I that I it's sort of like when
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:23.520]  you search for stuff on Amazon it tells
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:24.240]  you who it's
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.240]  who you're buying it from and you know
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.400]  with a lot of the smaller things like
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:30.800]  when you just go there and buy
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:34.240]  uh copy paper printer paper you know
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:35.040]  it's like full
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:37.120]  you know it's just you're not really
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.560]  buying it from Amazon you're buying it
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:39.040]  from
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.200]  some vendor that sells through Amazon
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:42.160]  but I've
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:43.920]  was under the impression that even if
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.520]  you wanted to buy like a mophie
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:47.840]  battery pack if you buy it directly from
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:50.080]  Amazon and you're not buying it from
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:53.360]  you know joe's battery right that you're
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.400]  you know you could
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:56.320]  be you know you could feel safe that
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:57.760]  you're getting the actual mophie
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:58.240]  product
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:01.360]  but you kind of have to be oh my god you
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:02.400]  have to be like a
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.320]  close reader how many people who shop at
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.640]  Amazon actually look at who it's
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:07.840]  who who's this
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:10.080]  fulfillment is I don't think most people
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.760]  most reasonable you know most regular
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:13.440]  people even know that that's how Amazon
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.000]  works
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.240]  you know I think they they just think
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.520]  you're buying it from Amazon
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:18.800]  and they don't even look they just look
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:21.200]  at prices and they might be curious
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:22.880]  about the fact that the same product is
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.720]  available at three different prices from
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:25.680]  Amazon
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:28.560]  because it's from three different um
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.080]  you know whatever you want to call them
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.240]  fulfillment partners
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:34.800]  um yeah or mark I don't know if it's
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:35.920]  through maybe through marketplace or
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:36.800]  maybe through their they've
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:39.520]  fulfillment by Amazon also you can send
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:40.720]  your stuff to Amazon
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.880]  and they will sell it to their own
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:44.000]  customers right
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.520]  this so you know I think you mentioned
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:46.880]  this in one of the pieces uh that you
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:47.520]  linked to
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:48.960]  the commingling so there's like two
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:50.480]  kinds of there's actually four kinds of
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:50.960]  fraud
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:53.120]  there are two kinds of major fraud one
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:53.920]  is
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.600]  oh god there's so many kinds of okay so
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.120]  commingling is
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:00.240]  company x ships a product to Amazon and
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.720]  they say this is exactly the same here's
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.400]  the SKU number this is product
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:06.560]  y that you already sell like a
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:07.920]  Cuisinart electric kettle which I'll
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.600]  explain why I bring that up right
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.440]  Amazon does commingling where they take
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:12.800]  this inventory I don't even know how
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.320]  many inspected or whatever
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:17.040]  they put it on their shelves as and they
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:18.240]  don't care
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:20.640]  uh they treat it as a fungible thing
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:22.320]  this thing that came from company x that
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:23.600]  claims its product y
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:24.880]  we're putting on the shelves in our
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:26.160]  warehouse next to this thing that came
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:27.600]  from the manufacturer
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.760]  that claims its product y right I have
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:31.680]  heard stories from multiple places and
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.360]  you can read them publicly too
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:34.880]  in a lot of these articles about
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:36.080]  companies like Birkenstock and
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.520]  Birkenstock has a different problem
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:38.800]  which I get to but
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.720]  you buy a product you go to Amazon you
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:42.080]  order product y
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:44.000]  and it comes and you're like this is not
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.440]  product y you complain to Amazon and
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.720]  they're like oh send it back we'll ship
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:47.680]  you a new one
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:49.120]  or you complain to the company I bought
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:50.720]  product y from Amazon they're like we
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.000]  didn't make that does it have this and
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:52.720]  this no
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.400]  that's a counterfeit that was put into
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.080]  Amazon's stream and we cannot prevent
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:57.520]  them from selling them basically
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:58.800]  that's the commingling problem
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:01.120]  Birkenstock has the undercutting
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.880]  problem where people are listing things
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.640]  basically as the same kind of thing
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:05.920]  they're undercutting Birkenstock's
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:07.360]  prices and they may or may not be
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:08.800]  shipping a Birkenstock they're probably
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:09.920]  shipping that thing as
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:11.600]  it could be they're buying them from
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.120]  some other source or it could be they're
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.560]  manufacturing something that is
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:15.840]  completely counterfeit
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:18.880]  and selling it and um they're both huge
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:20.080]  problems because in the one case you
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.280]  have this thing where people I mean
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.640]  actually Birkenstock has the same
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:23.920]  problem whether it's a commingled
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:25.600]  problem or counterfeit and cheaper
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:28.080]  someone buys it says Birkenstock screwed
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:29.280]  me they rented the company said we
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:30.480]  didn't make that what you buy from
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:31.120]  Amazon
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.720]  that's not ours you bought the 80 dollar
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:34.240]  one not the hundred dollar one we don't
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:35.600]  sell it for 80 dollars you bought the
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:36.720]  sucky one
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:39.440]  right so this just happened to me last
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:40.480]  night really
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:43.840]  yeah so what was the product so uh
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:45.360]  electric kettle love electric kettle
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.360]  I've had two uh brown model ones or
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:48.880]  brawn I guess we say in America
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.560]  uh my wife got one for a birthday like
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.720]  15 years ago it worked fine for
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:54.800]  several years and then it just died so
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:56.400]  we bought the identical thing
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:58.320]  it's like a 20 dollar one it's worked
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:16:59.840]  great it just dies of the day same thing
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.360]  some kind of you know it's got all these
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.360]  contacts breaks so I'm like okay I will
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:05.040]  find out what wire cutter recommends my
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.240]  old friends at wire cutter and sweet
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:06.880]  home
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.560]  was a contractor there for a bit I love
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:10.160]  the people there I love the process I'm
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:10.720]  like all right
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:12.000]  well what one do they recommend I'm like
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.600]  oh god it's 80 am I gonna spend 80
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:14.320]  dollars on a
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:16.000]  like I'm like ah I don't know I'm not
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.640]  made of money uh Jason Snell
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:22.080]  has a Breville T robot
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:25.200]  which is 250 which I've been eyeing for
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:27.360]  a year now I'm not I can't get it can't
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:29.120]  get a robot that makes tea
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:31.680]  it has a basket that lowers robotically
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:32.960]  and raises so it
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:34.960]  brew it's it steeps it for the right
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:36.480]  amount of time and I just wanted to
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:37.520]  clarify that it was
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:40.000]  tea the beverage and not like uh uh some
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.920]  kind of I I you know like a t-shirt like
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.200]  the letter
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:44.720]  something I wasn't familiar with it was
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.720]  a tea it's a tea brewing
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:49.120]  robot pot it's awesome it's and people
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:50.320]  love the Breville but I'm not ready to
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.080]  spend I'd love to be able if I ever got
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:53.600]  some great contract or something
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.000]  I might say this is my treat to myself
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.840]  I will get a robot that makes tea for me
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.040]  um you still have to put stuff in the
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:00.400]  basket but it moves it lose it up and
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:01.440]  down doesn't oversteep
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.440]  so anyway 80 bucks I'm like that seems I
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.800]  don't know so I start doing research and
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.240]  I go to Amazon because it's usually my
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:07.440]  first stop
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:09.600]  and there are like 700 electric kettles
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.760]  now and many of them have one review
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:14.320]  which makes no sense right like why is
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:15.600]  what's something with one review in a
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.200]  brand name I've never heard of
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:19.600]  in my 48 years on this planet and then a
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.040]  bunch of others I find one I'm like this
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.960]  is like 300 reviews I've never heard of
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:23.840]  this thing
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:27.120]  and 97 of them are five stars
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:28.480]  you know how the app store works same
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:30.160]  thing on Amazon so I'm reading the
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:31.680]  reviews it's like Marty says this is a
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:32.400]  great kettle
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:33.840]  this kettle does everything I want to
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:35.440]  it's great Jill says
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:36.880]  this kettle is great it does everything
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:38.720]  I wanted to this kettle is great it
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.240]  goes on and on and there's
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:42.560]  a few real five-star reviews and then a
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:44.000]  distribution of other ones I'm like I'm
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.280]  not gonna buy that because that's some
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:46.240]  piece of crap
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:48.640]  manufactured god knows where that they're
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.080]  you know for a finite amount of time
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.280]  they're gonna push through Amazon and
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:52.560]  make some hundreds of thousands of
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:53.360]  dollars
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:55.040]  so I'm like where are the 20 or 30 dollar
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.640]  good kettles like brown I can't find
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:58.480]  browns anymore everyone's got upscale
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:00.720]  kettles now cost 50 60 80 dollars just
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.480]  to do basic stuff so I'm like all right
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.080]  I'm gonna bite the bullet I I use the
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.840]  kettle two three times a day my wife
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:07.520]  uses it two times a day
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:09.280]  this is a high use thing I'm gonna I'm
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.200]  gonna spend 80 I'm I hate it but I'm
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:12.240]  gonna spend dollars
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:14.160]  I go to Amazon site and I'm like all
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:15.440]  right well it's 80 bucks okay I'm
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:16.640]  looking through reviews like this looks
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:17.760]  pretty good and then I look at the
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:18.640]  seller
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:20.960]  it's a Cuisinart but it doesn't say sold
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:23.840]  by Cuisinart it says sold by
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:27.440]  uh everything lucky I'm not making this
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:28.320]  up
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.720]  everything lucky to selling the
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:31.920]  Cuisinart
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:33.520]  and I'm thinking this this isn't right
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:35.440]  so I search an Amazon site for the model
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:36.560]  number it's like CP
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:39.520]  CPK 1212 or something and I'm like all
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:40.720]  right so where
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:42.160]  is this and then I find another listing
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:44.400]  for a hundred dollars with so okay so
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.880]  the the 80 unit everyday lucky
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.160]  which I find out later so he points that
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:50.320]  to me it says ever day lucky it's not
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:51.680]  even spelled right whatever the make you
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:52.000]  know
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.920]  they're mostly an everyday lucky is
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.520]  mostly selling iPhone cases
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:58.480]  and this Cuisinart alleged Cuisinart so
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:19:59.680]  the the $80
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:03.200]  everyday lucky listing has 2500
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.120]  clearly legitimate reviews they have
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.400]  managed somehow
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:09.280]  to hijack the main listing there's a
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:10.640]  hundred dollar version
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:11.920]  and if you look at all the other people
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:14.000]  selling this like Target Walmart
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.440]  Best Buy they're all selling this model
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:16.720]  for a hundred dollars so I'm like that's
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:17.040]  the
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:19.280]  list price clearly and the hundred dollar
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:21.200]  one on Amazon says buy sold by you know
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:22.720]  by Cuisinart it's being fulfilled by a
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:23.440]  third party
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:25.200]  but it's clearly the legitimate product
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:26.640]  but it has like seven reviews
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:28.160]  so I asked my friends at Sweet Home like
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.920]  what's going on here they're like oh
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:31.680]  what happened is like a response this
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:33.200]  money from Tony over there who's great
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:34.080]  you know they have all these deals
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.440]  people and everything it says
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:38.960]  what happened is the
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:40.640]  Amazon ran out of a stock that it sells
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:42.880]  directly and so they pulled
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:45.600]  a listing for someone selling it new not
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:46.720]  you know used or new
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:48.560]  refurbished whatever and they dropped
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:50.400]  that in so they don't drop the listing
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:50.880]  off
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.560]  and so in this case everyday lucky was
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.160]  the backup provider
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.320]  in their listing of third-party sellers
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.160]  for this particular model
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:00.320]  that's it's I've I'm looking at it as we
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:01.200]  speak it's
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.520]  ever thing like oh ever ever thing
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:05.040]  lucky sorry everything lucky
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:06.880]  I know isn't that and so that that is my
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:08.800]  story so it's still there
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.160]  yeah so well no so I wake up this
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:11.440]  morning and Tony has responded at
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:12.560]  Sweet Home via Twitter because great
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:13.840]  God he's like oh here's what's going on
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.280]  check it's back and I go I'm like oh
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:16.800]  there's the Amazon listing it's sixty
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:18.320]  seven dollars now now I feel
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.080]  justified I've waited right do you think
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.840]  that this is the real product though
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:24.880]  well we'll see here so I think it is it
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:26.480]  it may be but there's no way to know
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:28.080]  like I'm buying it from a third-party
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:28.800]  seller
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.960]  who has clearly done some magic so this
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:32.560]  morning I placed an order I paid sixty
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:33.280]  seven dollars
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:35.040]  everyone can criticize me for my
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:36.800]  profligate spending and
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:39.200]  if you like so please feel free anyway
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.400]  so I buy it
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.400]  and I write back to Tony I'm like hey
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:43.680]  the thing you're right swapped back and
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:44.880]  he's like I just went back and it's
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:45.360]  there
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.360]  apparently I bought the one model Amazon
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:48.320]  had in a warehouse
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:49.600]  that it fulfilled itself and it's back
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:51.600]  to everything lucky yeah so anyway
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:52.960]  that's the problem they have so I don't
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:54.480]  know so everything lucky
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:57.200]  could be selling me a legitimate object
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:58.560]  and still twenty dollars less than the
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:00.240]  retail price at Target Walmart
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:01.040]  etc
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:04.000]  however um they're getting the advantage
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.240]  of 2500 positive reviews and Amazon
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:07.760]  doesn't vet that that product
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:10.560]  is actually a new from Cuisinart item
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:11.840]  yeah so part of the
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:15.200]  part of the problem the the way that I
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.720]  mean this is so insidious but part of
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:18.560]  this problem now is if
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.960]  if it starts to if awareness starts to
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:21.680]  spread
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:23.520]  that you can't trust stuff through
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:25.440]  third-party resellers on Amazon
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:27.680]  it hurts all of the honest ones that the
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:29.680]  system was set up for in the first place
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:32.160]  exactly it's terrible all around there's
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:32.800]  also like
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:34.720]  even yet another variant on that too is
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:35.760]  that um
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:38.560]  so those are like the almost legitimate
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:39.920]  cases right like
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:41.920]  this could absolutely be a fell off the
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:43.520]  truck or you know bought like you know
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:45.200]  one of the things in China is that
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:46.960]  and I've heard this I hope I don't mean
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:48.720]  to tell lies about China so let's say
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:50.080]  this isn't I don't know if this is true
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:51.120]  but I've read it another
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:52.800]  number of accounts I've talked to people
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.240]  that admit stuff made in China it's a
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:56.400]  complaint made by a number of companies
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:59.440]  about things with China is some factories
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:01.680]  will gear up products for a given maker
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:02.960]  and during the day they're being
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:04.800]  supervised or being made for maker you
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:06.160]  know whatever company is
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.520]  you know Reebok or whatever it could be
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:09.120]  shoes it could be uh
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:11.680]  Cuisinart kettles at night they fire up
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:12.880]  the lines they make stuff and they sell
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:13.920]  that themselves
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:15.200]  and they're essentially identical
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:16.640]  sometimes there's labeling changes so
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:17.040]  they're
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.480]  the identical unit with it they're not
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:20.000]  labeled so they avoid some intellectual
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.120]  property issues
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:23.200]  so the Birkenstock thing when you're go
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:24.800]  to Birken to try to buy a Birkenstock
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:25.840]  thing and their list price is a hundred
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:27.120]  dollars for whatever
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:28.480]  and uh and there's people selling for
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:29.840]  eighty dollars you might be getting the
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:31.600]  legitimate thing it might be made as a
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.360]  factory nighttime job or
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:34.880]  who knows what or they're just doing
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:36.240]  deeper discounts because however
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:37.280]  they're acquiring it
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:38.720]  they're not honoring the list price the
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:40.080]  same thing that uh
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:42.560]  Cuisinart kettle bought from everything
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.080]  lucky could have been
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:45.440]  absolutely the same as anything
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:46.800]  purchased directly from an Amazon
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:48.960]  warehouse or from a third-party
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:51.680]  you know uh authorized Cuisinart thing
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:52.560]  but you don't know
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:54.080]  this the other problem though like the
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.600]  other thing is that uh
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:57.440]  what you're saying before is it's the um
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:58.800]  the counterfeit stuff that's just
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.240]  knockoffs that are crap
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:02.880]  and they appear to be listed the same so
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.560]  it's i see this all the time for
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:05.840]  you know all these different products
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.760]  i'm looking for for reviews and things
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:09.360]  you find stuff that is clearly the
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:10.800]  pictures are
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:12.880]  something off you buy it something's not
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:14.160]  right and
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:15.440]  you're not you know sometimes it's
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:16.720]  listed under a slightly different name
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:18.160]  sometimes it's listed as exactly the
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:19.040]  same thing and it's trying to take
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:20.400]  advantage of the reputation
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:22.240]  but all these problems persist because
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:24.480]  Amazon wants to sell more it doesn't
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:25.840]  want to do tighter inventory control
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:27.040]  because it costs a lot of money it
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:28.320]  shaves the margins off
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:30.640]  so i just sent you a link this is the
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.000]  1.8 quart
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.440]  cordless electric tea cuddle i think
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:35.760]  this is the product you're talking about
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:37.680]  i kind of yes that's kind of i kind of
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:39.520]  hate the interface to tell you i know
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:41.600]  it's the bet it's the best
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:42.800]  cheapest thing like if you want
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:45.040]  something better you have to spend more
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:46.720]  and like i know it looks horrible the
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:48.640]  queens aren't you see pay cpk
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:51.760]  17 sold by everything lucky now if you
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:52.160]  look
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:54.080]  i think it's the same product there's
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:56.480]  there's a thing that says size seven cup
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:58.960]  and yes one the two sizes that are
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:24:59.520]  offered
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:02.320]  is seven cup which is a hundred dollars
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:03.360]  and then the other one
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.120]  instead of measuring in cups it just
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:07.680]  gives you the dimensions of the box 9.7
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:10.080]  inches by six inches by eight
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:12.320]  and so it oh they may have managed to
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.720]  sneak oh interesting but they've made it
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:15.680]  look like there's
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:17.760]  two options of the same product but
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:20.240]  they're one is measuring by the
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:22.080]  cup capacity of how much water you can
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:23.680]  put in and the other one is measured in
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:24.160]  inches
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:25.680]  yeah and the one the eight quart one is
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:27.360]  the seven cup one is sold by
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:30.640]  card machine outlet ink oh the you know
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:31.600]  mine says
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:34.720]  oh it says mine says it's by cuisinart
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:36.880]  yeah you scroll down under in stock it
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:38.080]  says
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:40.560]  oh i see i know isn't it but so no mine
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:42.080]  is sold by kitchen capers
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:43.520]  oh my god what happens when i reload
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:45.200]  that's hilarious mine is from kitchen
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:46.240]  capers
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:47.520]  but every time i reload i'm getting a
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.280]  different answer i think uh
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:52.560]  and so this one is a hundred dollars and
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:54.080]  prime is available but that eighty
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:54.880]  dollar one
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:56.640]  to me is suspicious the eighty dollar
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:58.800]  one and i guess amazon defaults to it
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:00.000]  because it's cheapest
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.840]  yeah that's exactly the fact that that's
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:03.760]  the one by everything lucky the fact
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:05.760]  that it's cheaper makes me think that it
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.280]  might be fake i would actually if i were
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:08.800]  going to buy this right now i would buy
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:10.160]  i would actually spend the extra twenty
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:12.480]  dollars to get the one that says it by
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:13.120]  cuisinart
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:14.400]  yeah except here's the funny thing so
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:15.680]  when i logged in this morning amazon
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:16.480]  apparently had gotten
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:18.080]  one on their shelves that they fulfilled
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:20.400]  directly so it's listed as sold by amazon
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:22.560]  67 bucks so i got the deal i guess i got
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.400]  the one that was 67 dollars
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:26.000]  yeah i'm very happy about that i'm gonna
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.280]  be able to boil my tea at all kinds of
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:28.480]  temperatures it's gonna be now there's
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:30.000]  another there's another type of fraud
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.240]  going on on amazon and this is just
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:36.000]  comical come on i i linked i linked to
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:36.400]  the
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:38.480]  to somebody on twitter yesterday who
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:39.520]  bought uh
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:43.120]  wanted to get a floor mat and they got
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:45.120]  they got like a almost like a mouse pad
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:46.240]  type
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:49.120]  with printed on the mouse pad like it is
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:50.400]  it is format size but
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:53.920]  printed on the piece of foam
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:56.960]  is a screen print of the
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:00.080]  sort of texture of the full i was crying
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:01.360]  i was explaining that to my wife this
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:02.320]  morning because i was saying okay i
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:04.160]  bought a tea kettle here's my story
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:05.680]  and she's laughing and i told her about
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:08.160]  the other one the the cup the changing
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:08.800]  temperature
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:12.320]  pattern cup one right so the other one
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.560]  i guess i'll put a link to my to my
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:16.160]  daring fireball link piece in the show
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:17.920]  notes and i looked up there
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:19.920]  but somebody bought there was a listing
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:22.000]  on amazon and i showed a picture
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.560]  two pictures of the same mug one was
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.680]  like when it's empty
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:28.560]  and it just looks uh black and if you
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:30.400]  fill it with a hot beverage
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:33.440]  it with a color will uh that the it's
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:34.480]  printed with some kind of
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:36.560]  temperature sensitive ink yeah it
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:38.320]  changes and gives you like a snowy
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:39.440]  christmas scene
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:42.080]  and so somebody bought this on amazon
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:44.160]  and what they got was a mug where
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:45.040]  somebody had
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:48.240]  printed that photo of two mugs
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:52.320]  onto the mug so it was a mug thing a mug
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:56.640]  with a with a photo of two mugs
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:58.720]  on it it's kind of actually gonna be a
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:00.160]  great now that now that has become a
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:00.720]  meme
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:02.000]  that'd be a great gift i would love to
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.240]  buy a mug with a picture of two mugs on
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:05.920]  it i think that sounds great
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:09.200]  uh and i guess that the idea with that
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:10.400]  type of scam
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:13.360]  is that it is so i mean
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:15.200]  i'm guessing that this was not a very
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:16.960]  expensive mug that if it's only like
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:19.040]  four bucks or six bucks that people
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.840]  wouldn't even bother to send it back
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:23.440]  because it's like what's you know what's
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:24.800]  the point you know i mean like you feel
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.240]  like you're ripped off but at a certain
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:26.960]  point
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:28.880]  oh yeah it's more of a hassle to send it
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:30.880]  back than it is that the money's worth
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.240]  can i tell you my perfect walmart
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:33.600]  experience which is
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.360]  uh walmart pay just came out uh
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:36.720]  nationwide they rolled it out and i'm
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:37.520]  and this is
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:39.600]  so i've been laughing about currency
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:41.280]  which was the you know the big retailer
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:42.640]  system that was supposed to use
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:45.280]  2d codes and checking accounts and crap
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:46.480]  i've been laughing about that for years
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:47.680]  susie oaks and i in the mac world
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:48.480]  podcast
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:50.080]  every time a currency story comes out we
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:51.520]  make sure and highlight it so we can
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:52.480]  laugh at it
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:54.480]  because it sort of if it had come out
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:57.040]  before apple pay and then android pay
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:58.160]  maybe it would have gotten a little bit
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:28:59.680]  of traction i don't know but it didn't
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:01.600]  right it was like ridiculous it's finally
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:02.800]  been basically shut down they're
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:03.840]  focusing on the
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:05.920]  mcx consortium that's a bunch of these
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:07.920]  big retailers is now focusing on back
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:09.120]  end stuff which is great
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:10.800]  so walmart had been working on its own
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:12.160]  system it's a member of the mcx
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:13.040]  consortium
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:14.400]  but it's been working on its own variant
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:15.760]  and i saw an announcement that i'm like
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:16.400]  you know
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:18.160]  this doesn't look as awful you don't
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:19.680]  they don't accept checking account
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:21.280]  linkages so there's less risk of your
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:22.240]  stuff being
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:24.240]  hijacked right um where your checking
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:25.680]  account can be drained it's always a
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:27.440]  pain to get anything fixed i just talked
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:28.640]  to someone the other day
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:30.400]  they had a hundred and sixty thousand
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:31.600]  dollars taken out of their checking
[01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:33.040]  account after they sold a house
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.200]  took them six months to get it back even
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:36.560]  though they had not authorized anything
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:38.080]  they weren't even scammed the bank was
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:38.880]  scammed
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:40.800]  so checking accounts are a pain in the
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:42.560]  ass credit cards debit cards
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:44.800]  we have protections even um gift cards
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:45.920]  state troops
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:48.400]  yeah that's positively terrifying there
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:49.920]  are no protections on accounts let's go
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:50.800]  i'll go back to
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:53.600]  bitcoin and and gold um so uh state
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:54.960]  attorney generals have a lot of control
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:56.720]  over uh gift cards there's this those
[01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:58.160]  are state regulated
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:00.160]  and um so there's control even there so
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:01.680]  walmart pay will let you use a walmart
[01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:04.000]  gift card debit card credit card and uh
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:04.960]  uh
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:06.560]  prepaid card something like that and i'm
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:07.680]  like well this is kind of cool you still
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:08.800]  have to use a
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:11.760]  barcode you're scanning a 2d code um but
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:12.640]  it all looked
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:14.400]  sensible so i pitched to mac where let
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:16.000]  me go right about this is it sure so i
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.600]  find a walmart it's about 20 minutes away
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:18.720]  i've been to
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:20.080]  they've uh they opened it actually a
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.600]  store they shut down which is rare for
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:22.160]  them
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:23.520]  and i go there and first thing in the
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:25.040]  morning the place is totally empty no
[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:26.400]  one's even trailing me around to make
[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:27.920]  sure i don't steal there's no greeter
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.280]  nobody checked my receipt when i left
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:31.040]  the place is empty we need to buy a
[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:31.760]  cheap
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:34.480]  uh clock with a face for our dining room
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:35.280]  so that my
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:36.960]  younger son does not spend an hour and
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:38.880]  a half eating at the table the same
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:40.640]  piece of toast so he can get through
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:42.640]  things in the day so
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:44.080]  some children dawdle some eat fast
[01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:45.920]  anyway so i find a clock it costs
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:47.680]  650 i'm like this is great it's battery
[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:48.880]  operated looks cool i like the face
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:49.600]  whatever
[01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:51.280]  do the checkout process i actually quite
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:53.120]  like it i'd already set up walmart pay
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:55.920]  the app is actually very well designed
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:57.920]  point of sale system displays the code
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:59.840]  you just open your app you tap it and
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:01.280]  you're done and it's electronic i'm like
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:02.560]  this is great
[01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:04.320]  i get home i unpack it the clock doesn't
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:05.840]  work
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:09.040]  so that's the that's the walmart story
[01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:12.800]  uh i have noticed that seems like um
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:15.680]  i don't know if this was predicted or not
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:17.200]  i actually wanted to talk about apple
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:17.520]  pay
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:20.720]  um oh yeah it seems to me and and and
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:22.400]  apple is an interesting
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:25.120]  apple is usually late to most things but
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:26.240]  every once in a while
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:28.560]  they're early on things like for example
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:29.280]  wi-fi
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:32.480]  apple uh you know way like when apple
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:34.480]  introduced the iBook that had wi-fi
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:35.840]  they actually had to explain what wi-fi
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:38.080]  was and that was the that was the event
[01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:39.040]  where phil shiller
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:41.360]  uh did like a stunt like he like jumped
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:42.320]  oh yeah
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:44.000]  climbed up a ladder and jumped 10 feet
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.360]  onto a uh
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:48.240]  padded mat while holding the iBook to
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:48.960]  prove
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:50.720]  that it was you know getting the
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:52.240]  internet over the air like they
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:53.840]  actually it was almost like
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:55.920]  you know it the idea that you're getting
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:57.280]  internet over the air was
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:58.800]  such a novelty that they actually felt
[01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:00.160]  like they had to prove it
[01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:02.160]  um and it seems to me like apple pay is
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:03.360]  another one of those things where apple
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:04.640]  pay came out
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:07.760]  at the right time like because it's just
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:09.200]  maybe it's a local thing here in philly
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:10.240]  but maybe it's something else but a
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:10.960]  whole bunch of
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:12.880]  chains around here have suddenly started
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:14.800]  getting the chip and pin
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:17.840]  registers and they yeah they all seem to
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:19.120]  work with apple pay even though they
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:20.560]  don't have apple pay logos yet
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:22.320]  like so we have a supermarket chain here
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:24.960]  called acme they don't have there's no
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:26.000]  apple pay logo
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.200]  uh but it just says uh
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:31.360]  tap or pay or something i forget what
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:32.480]  they all say but there's like a little
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:34.320]  logo that suggests that maybe there's
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:36.640]  some kind of nfc thing and so i've i
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:37.600]  tried apple pay
[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:41.280]  and it just works and starbucks uh
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:43.600]  our locals at least the the one i go to
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.920]  uh now has chip and pin but a lot of
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:48.320]  these ones too they get the chip and pin
[01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:51.200]  um and then they have a piece of tape
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:53.680]  there and it says chip chip doesn't work
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:54.240]  yet
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:58.000]  yep um but at starbucks apple pay worked
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:58.720]  and i paid
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:02.160]  oh i paid with apple pay at starbucks and
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.800]  that's new right it is totally new i mean
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:06.480]  like you may have an early rollout it's
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:06.880]  like
[01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:08.960]  maybe like within the last 10 days at
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:10.160]  least here um
[01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:12.720]  and that the none of you know i and it's
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:13.600]  funny because it
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:15.600]  like whole foods where i go they've had
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:17.120]  apple pay for a while they were like a
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:19.120]  debut partner and like listed on the
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:22.000]  slide on the stage um
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.880]  and it i've been using it at at
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:26.400]  whole foods for you you know ever since
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:28.400]  it came out so it's not a novelty there
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:30.320]  but at starbucks i've gotten like two or
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:31.040]  three of the
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:32.560]  the clerks have been like whoa what did
[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:34.400]  you just do there that was amazing
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:37.200]  but then i went today and uh it didn't
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:37.920]  work
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:41.360]  it it worked insofar as as when i got my
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:43.200]  iphone near the terminal
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:46.240]  my credit card came up on the screen and
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:49.520]  it read my fingerprint and went
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:52.480]  ching and said done and then the little
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:54.960]  hand terminal uh said processing but
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:56.160]  then the processing
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:58.720]  uh never went through and it i forget
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:00.000]  what it said it just like
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.840]  processing was up way too long because
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:03.920]  apple pay is very fast usually
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:05.520]  uh it was processing way too long and
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:07.520]  then it said like uh
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:09.760]  payment could not be completed and so i
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:11.280]  had to you know pay with a
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:13.280]  actual credit card like a you know like
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:14.800]  a 20th century person
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:16.960]  i think my recollection is that nfc is
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:18.000]  typically like there's a
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.160]  it's a protocol the the payment is uh
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:21.920]  over nfc's a protocol so
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:24.320]  even if it isn't supposed to take apple
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:26.560]  pay if nfc is enabled at all
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:28.960]  it will try to do it but the back end
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:30.480]  part may not work because i think
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:32.480]  that was the deal was that um oh i
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:34.320]  forget cvs or something one of the mcs
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:35.280]  partners yes
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:36.560]  yeah at launch it was like people were
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:37.600]  paying with apple pay and they're like
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:39.120]  oh it's not supposed to work it's like
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:40.720]  they literally
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:44.320]  they literally did stay nationwide cvs
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:46.960]  disconnected their entire the the
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:49.600]  ability to pay with any nfc at all
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:51.920]  just so that it wouldn't use apple pay
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:53.520]  even though they were actually getting
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:55.120]  the money from apple pay it wasn't like
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:56.240]  they were getting ripped off
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:57.840]  it was they didn't want to put well they
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:59.280]  all had a deal and it was you know i
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:34:59.680]  just
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:01.040]  i just got emailed from a company i don't
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:02.640]  want to mention its name yet because i
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:03.760]  haven't tested it but
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:05.680]  you're so full of secrets i'm so no it's
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:06.800]  not that their secret i don't want to
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:08.160]  promote them until i see what they
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:08.880]  actually do
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:10.640]  uh they're in beta testing it like public
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:12.480]  baby you have to sign up our good friend
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:14.480]  adam lisa gore is
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:16.560]  is that a video for them so that's how
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:18.400]  incredible they are okay they're great
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:20.160]  um and it's a very funny video of course
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:23.120]  uh so and very informative so this uh do
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:24.640]  you remember several years ago there
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:25.280]  were some
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:27.680]  credit cards uh that would let you
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:29.840]  create an individual card number
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:32.320]  for every transaction yes yes i love
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:32.880]  that
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:34.880]  i use that and you could set things like
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:36.160]  this can charge no more than a hundred
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:37.840]  dollars a month this is a one-time use
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:39.280]  and should only work until such like all
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:39.840]  these things
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:41.120]  and the interface was terrible it's
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:42.880]  pre-mobile it was awful and online
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:44.000]  payment was terrible anyway
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.080]  so this is an outfit that is doing the
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:47.840]  same thing with an app
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:49.440]  you sign up you get a credit card through
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:50.800]  their partner which i forget which bank
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:52.000]  it is some major bank
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.080]  and uh 18 credit you know interest apr
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:57.360]  so it's you know it's the kind of card
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:59.040]  you better pay off because it's not
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:00.400]  reasonable otherwise and one percent
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:01.680]  cash back so it's they got all these
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:02.560]  parameters on it
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:04.160]  but the fact is like for online
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:06.160]  transactions like you're they have a
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:08.640]  physical card you can use that's got an
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:11.440]  emf or env chip in it um so you could
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:12.240]  use that but
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:14.000]  when you're paying online uh you know
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.080]  any kind of transaction you run the app
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:17.440]  it generates a unique number with
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:18.880]  whatever parameters you want like one
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:19.760]  time or whatever
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:22.000]  and you use that one-time number and so
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.680]  it gets stolen you know who stole it so
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:24.880]  i'm going to try they gave me an
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:25.680]  invitation
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.520]  i signed up i'm going to test my credit
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:29.760]  rating but um i had three card numbers
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:30.800]  stolen this year so far
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:32.320]  it's oh my god that's amazing it's been
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:34.640]  so long for me and numbers i had a visa
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:36.480]  and then an amex and another visa three
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:38.640]  different issuers and uh
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:40.640]  in every case i gotta tell you the fraud
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:41.920]  people have got i mean they used to be
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:43.600]  good i dealt with this in the past a bit
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:45.440]  but every call was with someone who was
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:47.280]  so crackerjacking like they're obviously
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:48.800]  paying people well they're training them
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:49.280]  well
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:50.880]  these people were amusing and fun to be
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.400]  like fun to talk to
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:53.600]  while we're going through all the crap
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:54.720]  you have to go through and they took
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:56.240]  care of it in every case
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:58.640]  they caught it in one case like a 38
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:00.720]  cent transaction to a charity went
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:01.360]  through
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:03.120]  and but everything else didn't so the
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:04.560]  pilot yeah
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:06.560]  yeah that's what they that's what they do
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:07.920]  i forget it wasn't me
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:09.680]  it was my wife i think i think it was
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:12.160]  amy gas station charge or an online
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:12.480]  charge
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:15.200]  uh like in a bodega somebody bought like
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:15.840]  coke
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:17.680]  they see if it's been cancelled yeah so
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:19.600]  they got it they they bought a coke
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:22.400]  and uh then they went to buy like uh you
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:23.120]  know i don't know
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:25.600]  tv yeah same same thing so in each of
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:26.960]  these three cases their fraud
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:28.480]  pattern got it and they're like in two
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:30.480]  cases nothing in one case 38 cents which
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:31.440]  was refunded
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:33.840]  and um poor charity they got 38 cents
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:34.640]  they didn't know they were going to get
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:35.680]  and then it's taken back
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:37.280]  um but so i'm very interested and you
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:39.280]  think so i am so excited for
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:42.080]  apple pay and safari not because i am so
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:43.680]  excited about apple pay but i'm like
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:45.280]  apple pain safaris can be the beginning
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:46.560]  of a transition
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:49.600]  because android pay in whatever browser
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:50.480]  is coming like
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:51.840]  there are going to be all these mobile
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:53.760]  pay options will now be available
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:56.800]  through desktop and um mobile web
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:57.920]  transactions
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:00.640]  the minute any of my cards is enabled
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:01.840]  i'm like never going to buy anything
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:03.600]  from a site that doesn't do apple pay
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:06.720]  in safari again i'm dreading my amex
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:08.480]  getting ripped off again it was a couple
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:09.760]  years ago and somebody
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:14.640]  some nitwit tried to buy uh jet skis in
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:16.960]  arizona or new mexico either arizona or
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:18.320]  new mexico that's very funny
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:20.800]  but uh you know the guy from amex called
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:21.680]  me and
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:24.640]  and said you know you're not trying to
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:25.200]  buy
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:26.960]  jet skis in arizona are you i was like
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:28.400]  no definitely not he goes all right well
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:29.120]  somebody is
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:30.720]  uh sorry you know and like you said
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:32.320]  totally on the ball
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:34.880]  just don't worry about it but your card
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:35.760]  is now cancelled
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:37.680]  i'm fed xing you a replacement it should
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:38.960]  be there tomorrow
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:42.160]  really sorry you know uh you know
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:44.560]  but you know and take a look take a
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:45.200]  look at your
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:48.160]  you know next uh you know statement and
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:50.080]  uh or i guess you read some of my recent
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:51.200]  transactions that were
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:52.800]  me and i was like yeah those are all
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:54.320]  good um
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:56.960]  but i'm dreading my the one i've had
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:58.480]  now for a couple years getting ripped
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:38:59.280]  off because
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:01.200]  it's my new couple my new card came my
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:02.720]  last three digits are
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:06.320]  007 oh my god yeah i love this card
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:07.840]  custom card numbers why don't they sell
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:09.760]  them i think if you're a very high like
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:11.440]  you're a whale of a card user
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:13.280]  or an investment i think you can get a
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.880]  number you want get some lucky numbers
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:15.520]  on there double
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:17.200]  can you believe it i got double oh my
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.120]  god that's so that's so good and i
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:20.240]  always read it when i have to read it
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:21.600]  over the phone i always say it that way
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:23.360]  like you know whatever whatever
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:25.040]  whatever whatever whatever whatever
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:28.240]  and then uh double
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:31.440]  uh yeah i think pain i mean
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:32.480]  the pain of thing the fact that we're
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:34.720]  still using unsecured numbers to do this
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:36.000]  is sort of hilarious like i i've
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.360]  wondered why can't the credit card
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.400]  companies be set up
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:40.400]  to do two-factor authentication like
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:42.240]  i'd be delighted if i went to amazon
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:43.680]  i punched in my cart around amazon
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:44.880]  because they have their own whatever
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:46.640]  they go to random site x
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:48.080]  and before the transaction goes through
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:50.000]  it texts me a code and i have to enter
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:50.560]  it like
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:52.640]  i know the back-end systems are ancient
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:53.760]  and weird and whatever
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:55.280]  but you'd think after this many years
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:57.600]  they could just tack that on and you'd
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:59.120]  enable it in your card and if you went to
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:00.320]  a site that couldn't do it
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:01.440]  you know they'd have to they'd say you
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:02.560]  know you have to try this transaction
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:03.840]  again after clicking a link that's being
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:05.760]  sent to you email or some kind of bypass
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:06.240]  but
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:08.640]  apparently the frictionless nature of
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:10.320]  e-commerce has to be emphasized
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:12.080]  over the amount of fraud fraud at some
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:13.520]  point becomes
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:14.960]  so high that they have to then invent
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:16.720]  new ways to you know prevent against it
[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:17.280]  but
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:21.040]  there's some balance there um so what do
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:21.360]  we think
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:24.640]  let's go back circle back to amazon i
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:26.400]  think amazon's got to clean this mess up
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:29.600]  i think amazon needs to
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:32.720]  uh i i know that they're operating at a
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:33.920]  massive scale
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:36.080]  and there's sort of you know an app
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:37.680]  store like problem there where if you've
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:38.080]  got
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:39.440]  all of these hundreds of thousands of
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:41.040]  products from all these partners that
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:41.520]  that
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:43.600]  you know maybe they can't ever achieve
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:45.200]  perfection but at this point it seems
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:47.040]  like nobody's even watching
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.280]  watching the the door you know what i
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:50.240]  mean yeah
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:51.280]  well they could say there's like they
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:52.560]  could say there's a thousand major
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:54.240]  brands or ten thousand major brands or
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:55.520]  they could even partner with major
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:57.120]  brands who want to do this
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:58.880]  and say if you're come if you're some
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:01.440]  no-name supplier who ships us a
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:02.160]  cuisinart
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:03.360]  electric kettle we're not going to list
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:04.560]  it as if we're not going to commingle
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:05.920]  the inventory because you're nobody
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:06.240]  right
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:07.600]  or you have to prove your relationship
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:09.280]  or you have to do some providence or you
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:10.560]  have to prove yourself over time they
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:11.520]  give you a you know
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:14.480]  they give you some kind of uh long
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:15.920]  payments so they do something
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:17.440]  to vet you before you're allowed to
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:19.440]  ship product that would be commingled
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:20.880]  they don't as far as i can tell they do
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:22.560]  a little bit of something i know there's
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:23.760]  issues about how they hold payment and
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:24.720]  so forth but
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:26.240]  um i don't think they have any real
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:28.800]  processes in place because it hasn't
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:30.320]  hit them yet but if you have companies
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:32.000]  like birkenstock saying we're
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.600]  more willing to um to back out of
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:37.440]  uh you know these relationships like
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:38.480]  you know like birkenstock i don't know
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:38.880]  how many
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:40.400]  tens of millions of products they sell
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:41.600]  online dollars of products that sell
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:42.400]  online but
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:44.320]  um it's got to be something so them
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:45.760]  saying basically they're going to tell
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:47.120]  me this was a leaked memo so we don't
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:48.400]  know you know this is internal
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:49.680]  stuff it wasn't a birkenstock
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:51.120]  announcement but if you have companies
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:51.760]  saying
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:54.240]  if you buy a product for us from if you
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:55.360]  buy a product
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:57.440]  with our name on it from amazon it is
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:41:58.880]  not authorized and it is likely
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:00.080]  counterfeit
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:02.720]  if it's being sold new that is i mean
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:04.560]  that that is serious damage to amazon's
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:05.040]  brand
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:07.040]  right because who wants that retail is
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:08.560]  largely about trust
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:11.040]  um in my opinion i mean i guess for some
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:12.480]  people it and maybe this is the way
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:13.600]  amazon sees it maybe
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:15.280]  i guess for some people retail is
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:17.120]  largely about price and it's all
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:19.040]  just cheap cheap price and you know
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:20.880]  walmart is sort of built on that
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:24.640]  but uh there's
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:27.040]  i think walmart has for people who who
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.960]  like walmart there's a certain trust
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:30.720]  right like i think part of it is that
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:31.920]  people trust that the prices are going
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:33.520]  to be low they just know you you know we
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:35.520]  don't have don't don't even bother
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:37.840]  going around town and pricing exactly
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:39.440]  pricing your dog food at
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:41.520]  at the supermarket to just get it at
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:43.120]  walmart you know it's going to be as
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:44.320]  cheaper cheaper
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:46.560]  uh and i think people know that when you
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:47.680]  buy you know
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:50.400]  uh whatever brand dog food at walmart it
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:52.560]  really is whatever brand
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:54.720]  dog food you know it's it's the you know
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:56.480]  the the cuisinart thing you buy at
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:58.480]  walmart is a cuisinart
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:01.440]  uh i think it's serious serious serious
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:02.640]  damage to amazon's
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:04.480]  trust that it's turning its reputation
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:06.240]  it's starting to be like ebay
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:07.520]  where it's like who the hell knows what
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:09.760]  god yeah it's it's true i remember by
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:11.040]  the way jeff bezos
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:12.800]  said this i worked for amazon briefly
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:14.880]  for like six months in 96 97
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:16.320]  was hired by jeff who i knew when the
[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:17.440]  company was starting out so it was a
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:18.720]  little bit of a you know it wasn't
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:20.320]  nepotism per se i did a great job
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:21.600]  i did a great job
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:22.800]  did a bunch of stuff they're still like
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:24.240]  i just did a bunch of programs i feel
[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:25.520]  very happy with my time there like what
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:26.480]  i got done but
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:28.720]  uh jeff said at some meeting and i i
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:29.760]  20 years ago i remember it very
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:30.960]  distinctly he said
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:32.320]  um we're eventually going to become
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:34.080]  authoritative like for price and what i
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:35.360]  mean by authoritative is not that we
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:36.640]  always have the best price that people
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:37.840]  don't think they need to go anywhere
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:38.160]  else
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:40.160]  they just assume we do right and i was
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:41.680]  like and that was like i thought it was
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:42.080]  like
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:43.360]  huh i wonder how that'll work out it's
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:45.360]  like boop that's what's happening so you
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:46.880]  know i run this book price comparison
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:49.040]  site called isbn.nu it's my ongoing
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:50.480]  programming experiment and running a
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:51.360]  large like a
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:53.120]  high traffic site it's millions of
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:55.200]  queries a day people just you know punch
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:56.800]  an isbn or you search on a book and it
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:58.720]  gives you price results from a dozen
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:00.560]  15 bookstores and what's fascinating to
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:01.840]  me is over time the revenue has gone
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:03.040]  down because people don't
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:05.440]  price compare that much and most of the
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:06.960]  revenue used to be amazon was i don't
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:08.640]  know like 25 percent of revenue now it's
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:09.920]  like 75
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:11.600]  because people come and they search like
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:13.360]  ah let's get it at amazon i mean that's
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:14.640]  kind of the result right
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:17.440]  and there was a point at which like most
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:18.960]  i think the majority of my money comes
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:20.400]  from people doing textbook
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:22.240]  searches because then you have more
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:23.840]  variety and i mean there's textbooks
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:24.640]  that sell
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:26.240]  there's people about textbooks that cost
[01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:28.080]  1200 and i get you know four to eight
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:30.000]  percent of that i'm like hooray but
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.720]  holy crap so uh and that so i get a lot
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:34.640]  of sales in uh you know in july august
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:36.000]  and january basically it's kind of a
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.440]  funny pattern i have
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:38.880]  um but it's been interesting to watch
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:40.800]  it because it's been this gradual change
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:42.960]  as as amazon is just assumed to have the
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:44.880]  best price and has other stores like
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:46.640]  why would you buy i i bought a bunch of
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:48.640]  dvds and blu-rays from barnes and noble
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:49.600]  a few weeks ago
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:51.120]  because they had a ridiculous sale they
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:53.440]  were doing 40 to 50 percent off
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:55.600]  everything already then they had a 30
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:57.280]  percent off coupon you could add with it
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:44:59.440]  and they had free shipping so i bought
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:01.600]  stuff some things for 70 to 80 percent
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:03.680]  off list price or off list price
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:07.120]  but i never buy from bn.com
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:09.040]  let me take one final break here thank
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:10.480]  our third and final sponsor of the show
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:12.240]  it is our old friends at casper
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:13.760]  a company that makes obsessively
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:16.160]  engineered mattresses at shockingly fair
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:16.800]  prices
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:19.040]  i have recently been on vacation we
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:20.400]  stayed in two different hotels
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:23.840]  uh split a little trip and one hotel had
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:27.200]  uh in my opinion a terrible mattress and
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:28.240]  i woke up every day
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:29.600]  and i was a little miserable and then we
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:31.440]  immediately uh spent the second half of
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:33.280]  the trip in a different hotel which had
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:34.800]  a terrific mattress
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:37.520]  and i sort of i thought of casper and i
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:38.160]  thought
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:39.680]  you know this because a lot of times if
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:40.960]  you don't think about it you don't get
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:42.720]  to compare one day after another what a
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:43.360]  difference
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:45.840]  a great mattress can make i am one of
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:47.520]  those people who says hey you really do
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:49.520]  sleep a third of your life it's worth
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:52.080]  getting a great mattress and a good bed
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:53.680]  uh you spend so much time in bed you
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:54.720]  don't you probably spend more time in
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:56.160]  bed than you do anywhere else
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:59.360]  uh why not get a great one well casper
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:00.160]  has created
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:01.760]  terrific mattress they have an
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:03.360]  engineering team in house
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:05.200]  that spent thousands of hours developing
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:06.400]  their casper mattress
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:08.720]  it combines springy latex and supportive
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:09.680]  memory phone
[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:11.440]  for a sleep surface with just the right
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:13.200]  sink and just the right bounce
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:16.720]  i love the fact that casper just has one
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:18.960]  type of mattress all you do is pick your
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:20.560]  size you just pick a size
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:22.320]  and that's the mattress because how the
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:23.760]  hell would you pick like if
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:25.200]  if they had like seven different types
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:27.280]  of mattresses how would you pick i don't
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:28.080]  know how to pick
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:30.880]  i just i trust that somebody who becomes
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:32.000]  a mattress engineer
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.080]  is going to do the job for me right it's
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:35.680]  sort of like apple in that regard where
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:36.960]  they're going to just
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:38.880]  do that's what design is design is
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:40.880]  making choices well casper has figured
[01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:42.320]  out what they think is the best way to
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:43.600]  make a mattress
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:46.320]  um now maybe you disagree maybe you get
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:47.440]  it you don't like it well guess what
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:48.480]  they have a hundred
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:51.680]  night home trial so if you buy the thing
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:54.000]  take it up the steps and they vacuum
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.360]  seal these things into the most
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:57.120]  ridiculously little you cannot believe
[01:46:57.120 --> 01:46:58.640]  that there is like a queen or king-sized
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:00.480]  mattress in one of these boxes
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:03.040]  um you take it up in a room follow the
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:04.560]  directions it sucks all the air out of
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:05.760]  the room to fill it up
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:06.880]  and all of a sudden you've got this
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:08.720]  little box now you've got a queen or
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:10.640]  king-sized mattress whatever you need
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:12.400]  if you don't like it you have a hundred
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:14.320]  nights and if you don't
[01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:16.080]  you just go to the website and say i
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:17.520]  take my mattress back they give you all
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:19.040]  your money back and they take care of
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:20.640]  the hassle of getting the mattress
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:23.520]  out of your house uh they that's how
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:24.720]  confident they are
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:26.880]  and how few people actually take them up
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:28.400]  on it so if you have any reluctance to
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:30.160]  buy a mattress online because you
[01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:31.360]  haven't actually
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:33.200]  sat there in a gross showroom where
[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:34.480]  other people have laid on the same
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:35.200]  mattress and
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:37.520]  and poked at it before uh you don't have
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:38.960]  to worry about it you can't lose
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:41.680]  um i have heard from readers a lot of
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:43.120]  readers it's the craziest thing in the
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:45.200]  world to me that i have become
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:46.720]  like a spokesperson for a mattress
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:48.720]  company among the many things i never

[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:24.640]  charming in a way that only people with
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:26.720]  an english accent can ever get away with
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:27.440]  while being
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:29.680]  he's he's a younger boris johnson for
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:32.240]  people into politics
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:35.120]  younger look at nasty reports and this
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:36.640]  relates to what you were talking about
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:38.800]  before where there is some subset
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:42.000]  of uh he's a participant in in this
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.480]  new subculture called the alt-right
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:48.240]  which is you know i don't want to get
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:50.400]  too much into politics of it but
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:53.520]  um there is a subset of this
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:56.320]  movement and of the internet at large uh
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:58.960]  that is
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:00.080]  of all the things in the world to be
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:03.520]  upset about very uh downright angry
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:06.640]  that uh the ghostbusters reboot
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:09.280]  features an all women cast of
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:10.640]  ghostbusters
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:12.480]  that the the people actually busting
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:14.000]  ghosts are
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.440]  uh for women when in the original
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:20.160]  movie i there were four men and they are
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:21.200]  very upset about this
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:24.160]  and uh i don't really know why uh it
[01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:28.320]  seems very strange to me i i i you know
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:30.240]  the people to me this is a sign that
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:32.080]  these people have some very
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:33.440]  uh
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:34.560]  i i think if you're upset that
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:36.640]  ghostbusters is now all women it is a
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:38.240]  very good sign that you have some
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:41.360]  very significant issues with women
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:44.480]  um well this guy uh i think i'm being
[01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:45.440]  fair here
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:49.680]  um somehow a week ago leslie jones
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:51.680]  also speaking of uh very talented
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:53.760]  current uh snl cast members interrupt
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:54.880]  you i love
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:56.880]  more than kate mckinnon i love leslie
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:51:01.680]  jones so much so much because she is
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:03.280]  the kind of comedian you did not see on
[01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:04.640]  television not just that she's
[01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:06.880]  black but she's like a statue s she's
[01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:08.480]  like i don't know she's sick something
[01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:10.480]  she's six feet tall but she is not a
[01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:13.200]  traditional you know figure she is she
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:13.920]  is this
[01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:17.760]  large beautiful totally outspoken woman
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:18.960]  with spiky hair
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:22.080]  who has this like incredible voice
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:24.320]  and she has this like intensity like
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:25.840]  john cleese at his best and he was like
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:26.960]  angry john cleese
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:28.400]  in the early money pythons and could go
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:30.080]  red face like she has this
[01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:33.200]  incredible energy and i love her
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:35.520]  and i love that she is on snl i love
[01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:36.800]  that she's in this film
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:39.040]  yeah i think she's really i like she's
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:40.480]  really great on snl too i
[01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:42.240]  love again like you said she's
[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:43.840]  definitely not the sort of comedian that
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:45.360]  you typically see
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:46.880]  uh i can't think of anybody else to even
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:48.640]  compare her to no i mean she's yeah
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:49.920]  she's kind of her own i mean
[01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:51.680]  i don't go to clubs but she seems to be
[01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:53.200]  like her own like
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:56.320]  unfor un like um she does not change
[01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:58.320]  herself for anybody else and she got
[01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:00.080]  her place in this show and is doing her
[01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:02.400]  thing absolutely uh she's a good writer
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:03.760]  too she's not just a good performer
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:05.360]  because i you know she writes like her
[01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:06.320]  own bits when she
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:07.600]  my favorites are when she's on the
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:09.120]  weekend update desk
[01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:11.200]  oh my god this is so good and that's
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:13.200]  really just you know those are her bits
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:14.880]  and they're real man well anyway she's
[01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:16.720]  in the ghostbusters she's busting ghosts
[01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:17.520]  and
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:20.720]  uh was on twitter engaging you know with
[01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:23.920]  the fans and somehow just started
[01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:24.480]  getting
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:28.320]  a just a steaming un ceaseless
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:32.160]  barrage of uh at replies and mentions
[01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:35.360]  uh uh racist misogynist
[01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:37.440]  uh i don't even know i mean there's got
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:38.640]  to be even more things
[01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:41.520]  more offenses uh but really some just
[01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:42.720]  sick sick stuff
[01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:46.560]  from these uh gamergate troll types
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:49.520]  uh and she you know engaged with them
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:51.360]  she started retreating some of them
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:54.640]  uh and this uh milo guy
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:57.360]  jumped in on it and including and to me
[01:52:57.360 --> 01:52:58.640]  the one i think probably put him over
[01:52:58.640 --> 01:52:59.760]  the top it was the
[01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:02.720]  one where he he posted a fake screenshot
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:04.880]  uh that made it look as though leslie
[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:06.640]  jones herself called somebody
[01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:10.400]  a uh a kike uh and she didn't
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:12.960]  she i think there's one where she he uh
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:14.560]  the manufacturer screenshot
[01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:16.240]  which had more than 140 characters by
[01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:17.920]  the way but it which was part of the
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:20.080]  tell but but who's counting was accusing
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:21.120]  him was like calling
[01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:22.880]  you know he's he's openly gay he makes a
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:24.640]  big point of being conservative and
[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:26.400]  very far right and gay and he's just at
[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:26.880]  the
[01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:28.000]  the republican national convention
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.160]  hosting a party um he's very into that
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:31.440]  right so he
[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:33.120]  the screen capture had something that
[01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:34.560]  was essentially making fun of him for
[01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:36.480]  being gay i forget the exact detail
[01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:38.000]  uh so that was part of it too like he
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.280]  was saying look i'm being attacked by
[01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:39.760]  her
[01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:41.600]  right when in fact she's not it was me
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:43.360]  and you and and these
[01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:47.200]  fake screenshots were not uh
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:48.560]  there's no way that you could they're
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:50.560]  not parody it's not like when our pal
[01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:51.120]  darth
[01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:53.680]  you know posts a picture that makes
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:55.040]  trump's hands seem like they're barbie
[01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:55.920]  doll size
[01:53:55.920 --> 01:53:58.080]  you know i mean like it's you know like
[01:53:58.080 --> 01:53:59.440]  that's parody
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:01.280]  and and and nobody is you know it's
[01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:02.640]  nobody's fool this is
[01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:06.080]  a deliberate attempt to to turn his
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:08.160]  followers to get them to actually
[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:09.600]  believe that she was
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:12.240]  committing you know these these acts of
[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:13.680]  hateful tweets as well
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:15.520]  which would encourage them to well hey
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:16.880]  if she's going to do that let's take the
[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:18.880]  gloves off you know now fair is fair now
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:19.760]  we can
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:24.480]  you know go racist and misogynist on her
[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:26.480]  and so what happened is this guy and
[01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:27.760]  this guy's been in trouble with twitter
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:29.280]  before where people have reported him
[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:31.680]  for this sort of
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:34.800]  abuse and harassment leading a a caterer
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:35.760]  of harassers
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:38.160]  before he at one point he was verified
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:39.920]  um you know i think it was part of the
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:41.840]  whole thing he is a journalist he works
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:43.360]  you know he's worked for legitimate
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:45.440]  publications before i think he's the
[01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:47.440]  tech correspondent for bright bart now if
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:48.880]  you don't know bright bart it's
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:52.560]  uh a a well i think all
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:54.160]  it'll say everything you need to know is
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:57.600]  it's a conservative uh leaning uh
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:00.160]  website that was very very early on the
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:01.200]  pro trump
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:03.680]  well yeah if the current state it's also
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:04.880]  if you haven't looked at bright part in
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:06.000]  a while i'm not sure you should but it
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:07.440]  was founded by andrew bright bart who's
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:09.120]  like was was our age
[01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:11.120]  and then died and yeah i know people who
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:12.160]  liked him actually like
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:14.240]  like friend a friend a friend liked him
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:16.000]  very much personally his site was oh he
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.600]  had tried it he'd helped co-start
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:19.120]  huffington post and then left and started
[01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:20.400]  this far right thing
[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:22.640]  and um but it wasn't uh didn't involve
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:24.240]  like white supremacy and
[01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:25.920]  whatever it was it was pretty far right
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:27.600]  and he's the one who found uh elliott
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:30.160]  spitzer's was who's picked no anthony
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:31.520]  wiener's wiener didn't he have the shot
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:32.800]  of that i think in revealed
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:35.040]  i don't know anyway so but and so bright
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:37.120]  bart now if you remember what bright the
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:38.320]  site was like when andrew bright bar
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:39.520]  were live and ran it
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:41.360]  this is like something even so far
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:43.280]  beyond that it makes me look back fondly
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:44.560]  at the time that andrew bright bright
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:45.040]  bart
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:47.440]  ran the site yeah right when bright bart
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:49.440]  ran it mine i was not a regular reader
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:50.080]  of it but
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:53.440]  i i was familiar with it um
[01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:55.680]  it was like something i didn't agree
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:56.880]  with but not something that i found
[01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:58.080]  offensive whereas yeah
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:00.480]  to me is it is borderline offensive it's
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:03.280]  yeah exactly to me it comes about as
[01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:07.120]  close as you possibly can in today's uh
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:09.040]  even if you're anti quote unquote
[01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:10.880]  anti-politically correct
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:14.160]  there are still uh moda comes of
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:16.640]  of discourse that we all agree to it
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:18.480]  comes about as close as you can
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:20.720]  in in the guidelines of modern discourse
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:21.360]  to being
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:24.480]  uh like white supremacist in my it's yeah
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:26.000]  it crosses into
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.400]  it it almost i mean this is because this
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:29.920]  is milo's stick without even getting into
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:31.360]  the political aspect of it because
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:34.160]  there are left left side extremists who
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:35.680]  do the same thing and we saw
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:37.200]  a lot of times the left does not get the
[01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:38.640]  same criticism as the right the right
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:40.000]  seems to get a lot more coverage when
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:41.360]  they say extreme things
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:43.440]  and they verge into you know nativism
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:44.880]  and white supremacy and
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:46.880]  things and you know anti-semitism and so
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:48.240]  forth the left
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:50.240]  has unfortunately the far left has an
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:51.920]  anti-semitic strain as well
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:54.480]  and other kinds of extremism and the
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:56.080]  whole uh bernie
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:58.080]  period revealed unfortunately that a
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:00.480]  subset not all not all bernie bros
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:02.160]  not all bernie supporters but a subset
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:04.400]  of uh sanders the people who
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:06.960]  alleged to be may have been good trolls
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:07.520]  may have been
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:09.440]  deep supporters also engaged in some
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:10.800]  pretty severe activity
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:12.640]  and it's they but they always try
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:13.920]  especially i mean bright bar does a
[01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:15.520]  great job of this milo especially
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:17.120]  they're trying to come up to the line of
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:19.440]  hate speech without crossing to it where
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:20.720]  they get into something that's
[01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:22.720]  that's actually actionable where they
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:25.040]  get sued and lose not just get sued but
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:25.600]  sued
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:27.680]  and clearly lose or in which they would
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:29.600]  cross some line in which
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:32.160]  some aspect of decency would involve
[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:32.880]  there might even be
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:35.280]  a criminal statue like hate speech is
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:36.800]  not protected in a line you know all
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:38.080]  speech is not absolutely protecting the
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:39.360]  united states there's been a lot of
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:40.800]  trials about it but certain kinds of
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:42.880]  hate speech used for incitement
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:44.320]  uh especially if you're publishing a
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:45.920]  website in multiple countries
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:47.200]  uh i don't know if i can't remember if
[01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:48.880]  milo lives in the u.s uk or he's back
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:49.760]  and forth but like
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:51.360]  he could wind up being you know
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:53.840]  prosecuted if he crossed certain lines
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:56.400]  in outside the u.s then here anyway so
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:57:57.600]  like they but they are
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:00.000]  they are knowingly skating up to the
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.680]  precipice and skating back where they
[01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:03.040]  will get as far as they can with the
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:04.640]  skates hanging over the cliff
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:06.960]  you know before they they skate back
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:07.840]  yeah uh
[01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:11.280]  and i don't think it's any coincidence
[01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:12.960]  i mean part of it is that leslie jones
[01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:15.920]  was engaging on twitter
[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:17.520]  but i don't think it's any coincidence
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:19.600]  that of the four ghostbusters
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:21.840]  they went after her the one who's not
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:25.280]  just a woman but is also black
[01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:28.160]  this guy's been in trouble with twitter
[01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:29.360]  before at one point he was verified
[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:30.640]  that's why i mentioned he's a journalist
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:31.440]  they they
[01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:33.600]  removed his verified badge which is very
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:35.360]  odd thing i thought that was very
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:36.000]  unusual
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.520]  like i could see why twitter wants to
[01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:38.880]  deal with this guy but removing his
[01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:40.720]  verified badge was a very strange move to
[01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:41.280]  me because
[01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:43.120]  i didn't like it i didn't like it either
[01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:44.560]  because it it
[01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:46.400]  a it plays into this whole notion that
[01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:48.240]  having the verified badge is this mark
[01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:49.440]  of prestige
[01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:52.080]  which to me is like nonsense i don't
[01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:53.760]  know i mean i got verified i didn't ask
[01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:54.640]  for it it was like
[01:58:54.640 --> 01:58:57.120]  it somehow what happened is remember
[01:58:57.120 --> 01:58:57.920]  when matt honan
[01:58:57.920 --> 01:59:01.360]  got uh uh hacked oh yeah yeah
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:03.680]  so matt honan uh who's now at uh
[01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:04.480]  buzzfeed
[01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:06.160]  got hacked like two years ago and he
[01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:08.080]  wrote a great story about it and it was
[01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:09.840]  somehow that was like you know it was
[01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:11.680]  sort of a
[01:59:11.680 --> 01:59:14.000]  social engineering where his attacker
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.120]  called apple
[01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:16.800]  and said you know claimed to be him and
[01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:18.400]  somehow got through a couple of the
[01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:19.520]  questions
[01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:22.800]  and got his you know mac.com his icloud
[01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:23.680]  account
[01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:27.040]  um uh reset and then once they had his
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:28.480]  email account that was the email
[01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:30.480]  account used by his twitter account and
[01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:31.200]  so his
[01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:33.520]  at mat you know it seemed like the
[01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:34.880]  target of it was that
[01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:37.600]  because he has this very short uh twitter
[01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:38.320]  handle at
[01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:40.720]  mat uh isn't that his twitter handle i
[01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:41.840]  think it used to be
[01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:43.680]  yes that's right it's super short they
[01:59:43.680 --> 01:59:45.040]  really wanted that and
[01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:46.480]  i have a friend who has a very short
[01:59:46.480 --> 01:59:48.000]  handle that apparently it's
[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:49.920]  part of her name but it's four letters
[01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:51.840]  and it relates to some programming thing
[01:59:51.840 --> 01:59:53.520]  so she is being regularly harassed by
[01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:55.280]  script kiddies and how to get someone
[01:59:55.280 --> 01:59:57.280]  permanently suspended because of their
[01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:58.960]  uh doxing attempts yeah
[01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:01.360]  uh or yeah it's a weird thing where
[02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:02.160]  like certain
[02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:05.360]  handles are so in demand jesse char is
[02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:08.240]  at jesse on instagram oh every every
[02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:09.520]  photo she posts there's some
[02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:11.120]  girl named jesse you know not the same
[02:00:11.120 --> 02:00:12.880]  person but every time it's can i have
[02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:14.000]  your twitter handle
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.320]  there's you know uh dave rutledge uh uh
[02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:17.520]  works at me
[02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:19.200]  um our friends at man which is i've been
[02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:20.400]  running for math by the way which is a
[02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:21.280]  fun place to wait for
[02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:23.680]  he's at he's at underscore yeah and his
[02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:25.200]  wife is at underscore underscore and
[02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:26.720]  their child is at underscore underscore
[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:28.640]  underscore well his wife's at underscore
[02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:29.200]  underscore
[02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:31.600]  got ripped off got hijacked somehow and
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:33.120]  he eventually kind of was trying to
[02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:34.080]  they're trying to go through channels
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:35.120]  they eventually kind of bumped up like
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:36.560]  anybody help us and somebody
[02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:38.080]  at twitter was like got your back and
[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:39.680]  took care of it but um she almost lost
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:40.880]  at underscore underscore
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:42.880]  oh well anyway they took away his
[02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:44.320]  verified badge which is weird because to
[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:44.960]  me
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:46.560]  it's almost like to me that isn't like
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:48.640]  we're punishing you it's like
[02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:50.000]  to me that would be like we're no longer
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.920]  certain that this account is who you is
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:52.560]  you yeah
[02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:54.080]  but they knew it was him there's no
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:56.000]  question that it was him so removing the
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:57.280]  verified badge
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:00:59.440]  is very strange oh well you know but
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:00.960]  the reason they do it though i think the
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:02.560]  reason they did it and i and i have the
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:04.160]  same reaction you do too it's like
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:05.760]  twitter shouldn't be anointing people
[02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:07.040]  they originally started the verified
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:09.440]  program to help celebrities in some news
[02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:10.400]  outlets um
[02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:12.480]  prevent to have a legitimate account
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:13.920]  that showed it wasn't being impersonated
[02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:15.280]  that they'd vetted it right
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:17.120]  and they used to have requirements that
[02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:18.080]  you had to have two-factor
[02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:19.600]  authentication or some other protection
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:20.640]  on your email
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:22.240]  or they would ask and so they vetted
[02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:24.000]  entire newsrooms where the newsroom had
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:25.600]  shown them or discussed
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:27.440]  um you know their techniques to prevent
[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:28.880]  email from being hijacked so that they
[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:30.240]  wouldn't be overtaken
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:32.080]  especially if they're like ap hijacks and
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:33.440]  a bunch of news outlets got hijacked a
[02:01:33.440 --> 02:01:34.480]  few years ago so
[02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:36.880]  um but the thing the the thing that uh
[02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:38.400]  the reason i think they did it is
[02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:40.160]  if you're verified i'm not sure you
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:41.440]  probably know this you know there's they
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:42.880]  have the tools you see only verified
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:43.520]  accounts
[02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:45.120]  so if you're looking at replies so i
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:47.520]  think this was to get him to not show up
[02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:49.760]  in the replies to other people who are
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:51.680]  verified like celebrities and
[02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:54.400]  whoever i say yeah i know because you
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:55.280]  know i tweeted so
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:58.480]  um chrissy tigin uh the supermodel i
[02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:00.400]  think she is also awesome like i don't
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:02.000]  even know her super modeling career like
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000]  i've seen pictures of her she's
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.280]  like most supermodels one of the most
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:06.640]  beautiful women on the planet great
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:07.600]  right but i don't it's
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:10.080]  it's fine just beautiful um sports
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:11.120]  illustrated
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:13.120]  model right cover model so but that i
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:14.480]  didn't follow her because at some point
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:14.960]  i
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:16.160]  noticed people be tweeting these
[02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:18.320]  incredibly funny really direct stuff
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:19.760]  she's saying about you know
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:21.200]  not just like feminism or politics
[02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:23.280]  whatever but the way that which she has
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:24.960]  to defend herself she's married to john
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:26.640]  legend about people telling her she
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:28.160]  doesn't deserve him and he's been duped
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:29.360]  in whatever she is
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:31.200]  awesome she is so forthright and so
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:32.720]  great she has a cookbook out
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:35.440]  so i she tweets something last night i
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:36.400]  wrote something back
[02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:37.840]  to her i can't just some little thing in
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:39.280]  passing i don't think she's gonna be it
[02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:41.040]  she favorited it and i'm like good god
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:42.640]  just the thing has four thousand
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:43.520]  favorites on it
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:45.600]  why would she do that i'm like oh she's
[02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:46.960]  using this filtering
[02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:48.720]  i have a verified tag so there is a
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:50.240]  little bit of a superpower
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:51.920]  that is associated with it is you have
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:53.600]  more visibility to people who are
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:55.040]  verified so i'm you know
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:56.480]  some random journalist who works in a
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:58.160]  daylit basement um
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:00.720]  and i can but because of that it's like
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:03.680]  that i think is the power of that blue
[02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:05.120]  check mark yeah well what happened yeah
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:06.000]  what happened for
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:07.920]  people like me and you is after honan
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:09.760]  got hacked and i think he got hacked i
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:11.200]  think i might be misremembering the
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:12.960]  details i think he got hacked those
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:14.160]  i think it was very clear it was about
[02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:16.400]  his his mat twitter handle i think
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:17.360]  you're totally right
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:19.440]  but it was early but yeah twitter i
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:20.800]  think as a precaution
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:22.640]  thought well maybe it's because he's a
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:24.320]  tech reporter and that
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:25.920]  all of a sudden in a very short period
[02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:26.560]  of time
[02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:27.920]  like i think me and you probably got
[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:29.600]  verified right around the same time
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:32.160]  a lot of people at macworld did um i had
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:33.520]  to wait a bit i had to ask them for
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:35.440]  actually a few years because i did you
[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:36.720]  well the thing was i felt there was this
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:38.080]  developing thing where a lot of
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:38.960]  journalists were getting
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:40.160]  marked and i'm like look i'm a
[02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:42.000]  freelancer yeah not having a blue check
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:43.520]  mark makes me look like i'm not
[02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:45.040]  legitimate on twitter
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:46.800]  and i'm like i don't care or not but if
[02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:48.480]  you're gonna have a system i want to be
[02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:49.120]  in it
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:51.280]  so that then and likewise like i can
[02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:52.560]  direct message people
[02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:54.400]  who don't have dms open and they can dm
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:55.680]  me even if i have
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:57.760]  dms off because we're verified like
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:03:59.040]  that's a funny thing there's a couple
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:00.000]  little things
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:03.280]  that are useful it's a very strange club
[02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:05.040]  yeah it's a weird club and it's like it's
[02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:06.960]  got supermodels the president states and
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:08.160]  you and me it's great i love being in
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:08.960]  this club
[02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:11.200]  i've told this before it and it is
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:12.560]  incredibly embarrassing
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:15.600]  but it's uh my son
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:17.360]  told his friends at school that i'm
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:19.200]  verified and all the girls in the class
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:20.560]  thought it was the coolest thing that
[02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:23.040]  they didn't think
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:25.120]  that's awesome they were like no way they
[02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:26.480]  didn't believe them they didn't believe
[02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:29.280]  them so like they
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:31.280]  yeah they opened up a chromebook and
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:32.560]  loaded my twitter page and they were
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:33.920]  like that's so cool
[02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:36.320]  oh my god that is awesome that is
[02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:37.840]  terrible i i think it's
[02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:41.120]  just dreadful but anyway milo yanopoulos
[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:42.400]  they they took away
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:44.560]  his badge they had suspended him
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:45.920]  temporarily for
[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:47.600]  similar incidents in the past and he'd
[02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:49.680]  always come back and after this one
[02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:50.560]  uh
[02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:52.480]  right before he was supposed to go into
[02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:54.320]  some kind of event in cleveland for the
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:56.000]  republican national
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.480]  convention he received an email that
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:04:59.280]  said uh
[02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:00.400]  this is it you're done you know your
[02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:02.480]  account is permanently suspended yeah
[02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:04.000]  uh one of the weird things about that i
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:05.440]  think they did the right thing
[02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:08.560]  uh i think this guy was abusing
[02:05:08.560 --> 02:05:10.960]  twitter and i don't think twitter should
[02:05:10.960 --> 02:05:12.720]  tolerate it but it is weird
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:15.520]  it it's there's a weird like down the
[02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:17.120]  memory hole aspect to it where once his
[02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:18.960]  account is suspended all of his tweets
[02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:19.600]  are gone
[02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:21.600]  yeah i don't yeah i know that's you know
[02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:23.360]  so when they do temporary suspensions
[02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:24.800]  they will often make people
[02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:27.600]  agree to delete specific tweets through
[02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:28.960]  an automated process before they're
[02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:30.160]  allowed to the account back
[02:05:30.160 --> 02:05:32.080]  so those only those tweets are deleted
[02:05:32.080 --> 02:05:33.920]  like however odious something is i'm
[02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:35.680]  like well this is deleting history now
[02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:37.120]  no one knows that he said
[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:39.440]  these hundred thousand terrible things
[02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:40.800]  yeah and that was part of it and and
[02:05:40.800 --> 02:05:42.560]  there were you know i wrote briefly
[02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:44.240]  about this on daring fireball i support
[02:05:44.240 --> 02:05:46.480]  this and my take is that his supporters
[02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:48.720]  or say and i've seen this argument with
[02:05:48.720 --> 02:05:50.160]  other people this is not the only time
[02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:50.960]  but
[02:05:50.960 --> 02:05:52.720]  when when something like this happens
[02:05:52.720 --> 02:05:55.200]  and after instigating this sort of abuse
[02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:56.480]  and
[02:05:56.480 --> 02:05:58.000]  they say well now that they've
[02:05:58.000 --> 02:05:59.760]  suspended his account they're obviously
[02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:00.320]  their sense
[02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:02.800]  this is twitter is a company that censors
[02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:03.760]  conservatives
[02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:07.120]  and suppresses free speech right right
[02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:10.400]  as though the right to harass people on
[02:06:10.400 --> 02:06:11.280]  twitter
[02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:12.640]  and and i don't think there can be any
[02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:14.320]  argument that what was done to leslie
[02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:14.880]  jones was
[02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:16.640]  outright harassment i mean she was she
[02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:17.920]  seemed genuinely
[02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:20.720]  emotionally distressed at what she was
[02:06:20.720 --> 02:06:24.240]  seeing and dealing with
[02:06:24.240 --> 02:06:26.240]  the argument that that is that should be
[02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:28.320]  protected free speech is just nonsense
[02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:30.720]  and it just shows that these people are
[02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:33.120]  in my opinion not not just you know
[02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:33.840]  racist
[02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:35.840]  and and misogynist but that they're
[02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:37.840]  outright like sociopaths that they're
[02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:39.520]  they're they're so
[02:06:39.520 --> 02:06:42.880]  emotionally
[02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:46.240]  stunted that that they're
[02:06:46.240 --> 02:06:48.080]  it's very hard you really can't argue
[02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:50.080]  you can't rationalize with these people
[02:06:50.080 --> 02:06:51.440]  and and there were other readers there
[02:06:51.440 --> 02:06:53.520]  were i got some feedback from people
[02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:55.040]  you know read during fireball very
[02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:56.400]  thoughtful and and
[02:06:56.400 --> 02:06:58.080]  you know some people i know some just
[02:06:58.080 --> 02:06:59.600]  brand you know random readers
[02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:01.120]  who were very you know said i'm very
[02:07:01.120 --> 02:07:02.960]  uncomfortable with this you know i don't
[02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:04.640]  like i'm not racist or misogynist these
[02:07:04.640 --> 02:07:05.680]  weren't people who are
[02:07:05.680 --> 02:07:07.600]  milo yanopoulos fans but they were like
[02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:09.280]  i'm just very uncomfortable
[02:07:09.280 --> 02:07:12.640]  with twitter um
[02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:14.320]  you know saying that somebody you know
[02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:15.760]  this is allowed and this isn't
[02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:17.200]  there should be a free for all but if
[02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:19.120]  you can't have a free for all you just
[02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:20.960]  and alan well you could you could run a
[02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:22.240]  service that's a free for all but it's
[02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:22.800]  not
[02:07:22.800 --> 02:07:25.120]  going to be a pleasant place yeah among
[02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:26.400]  other things i mean twitter has
[02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:28.880]  rules of engagement has terms of service
[02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:29.520]  and
[02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:31.920]  uh he was violating them yeah and and
[02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:33.360]  the question is how
[02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:35.120]  like the reason they got criticism about
[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:37.600]  this is famous persons attacked famous
[02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:38.800]  prominent person who's already under
[02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:41.280]  attack as part of like a cultural war
[02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:42.320]  against you know
[02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:43.680]  people who may align with trump and
[02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:45.520]  people may align with other progressive
[02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:46.320]  movements
[02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:48.800]  uh so and i actually saw leslie jones
[02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:50.720]  interviewed by her friend seth meyers
[02:07:50.720 --> 02:07:51.520]  and his show
[02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:53.040]  and it was lovely and she was talking
[02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:54.720]  about this whole situation
[02:07:54.720 --> 02:07:56.400]  oh really i didn't see that yeah it was
[02:07:56.400 --> 02:07:58.080]  like four or five minute clip and
[02:07:58.080 --> 02:07:59.040]  one of the things they showed was a
[02:07:59.040 --> 02:08:00.240]  bunch of people who'd sent into seth
[02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:02.000]  meyer like these little videos
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:03.440]  of just how you know you're awesome
[02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:05.040]  leslie you're so inspirational it's like
[02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:06.800]  just like a little girl and an adult
[02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:08.400]  couple and just like all kinds of people
[02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:09.440]  it's great and she was practically
[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:10.880]  crying because it was just you know
[02:08:10.880 --> 02:08:13.120]  so you'll be so nice about it but um she
[02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:14.000]  said um
[02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.480]  he said you know should it rise seth
[02:08:16.480 --> 02:08:18.080]  asked a very good question he was like
[02:08:18.080 --> 02:08:19.680]  should this rise the level like
[02:08:19.680 --> 02:08:21.280]  you and i are kind of well known like we
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:22.240]  have a lot of you know whatever a lot of
[02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:22.960]  followers
[02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:24.320]  and she's like this should be and she
[02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:26.080]  said you know this is for it should be
[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:27.600]  for everybody no one should go like he
[02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:29.280]  said she said if i never
[02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:30.880]  spoke up about this no one would ever
[02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:32.720]  have known it happened to me
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:35.040]  um but i made a fuss right and um if i
[02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:36.720]  she'd never talked back to people
[02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:38.080]  it still would have affected her because
[02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:40.800]  it's asymmetric and right i think that's
[02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:42.320]  that's the issue the question i would
[02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:44.080]  say too when you look at milo like he's
[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:46.240]  a provocateur that's his stock and trade
[02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:48.080]  he talks about being a provocateur he
[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:49.520]  wants to get a reaction
[02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:50.960]  and he's very good at it now it's
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:52.240]  unfortunate that what he wants that he's
[02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:53.280]  not you know
[02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:55.520]  in my mind funny or interesting or or
[02:08:55.520 --> 02:08:56.480]  decent or
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:08:58.240]  or whatever i think he's off the charts
[02:08:58.240 --> 02:08:59.920]  in terms of you know being
[02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:01.280]  practically a sociopath and the way that
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:03.200]  he acts it's he acts consistently in his
[02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:05.040]  self-interest without regard for
[02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:06.880]  any standards of morality or decency and
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:08.000]  that's you know it doesn't matter i
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.520]  don't care if he's left or right
[02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:10.800]  it doesn't i'm not even talking about any
[02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:12.960]  political view he has it's his behavior
[02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:14.480]  and it's not political correctness when
[02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:15.200]  you're
[02:09:15.200 --> 02:09:18.000]  specifically trying to say things that
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.280]  you know will call it like
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:21.680]  political correctness is when you are
[02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:23.680]  told not say something that is a
[02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:25.360]  reasonable statement that is not designed
[02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:26.400]  specifically
[02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:28.960]  to harm someone and is actually part of
[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:31.360]  social discourse that needs to occur to
[02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:32.720]  improve the social good
[02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:34.000]  that is political correctness i've
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:35.280]  encountered there's a lot of things as
[02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:36.080]  somebody who's
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:37.920]  you know left the center maybe a liberal
[02:09:37.920 --> 02:09:39.440]  lifelong democratic voter
[02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:41.040]  there are things that i do not feel
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:42.720]  comfortable discussing in public because
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:43.680]  i know
[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:46.560]  i can't discuss in a way without having
[02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:48.960]  a blowback that would be pretty severe
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:50.560]  even though i have no bad intent and i
[02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:52.000]  want to talk through an issue as opposed
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:53.440]  to make statements right
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:55.360]  so there is there is a chilling effect
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:09:56.880]  in certain areas that i would call that
[02:09:56.880 --> 02:09:58.560]  because you can't even bring up
[02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:00.320]  this happens like easy case which i can
[02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:01.680]  talk about it's like look at israel
[02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:02.800]  support of israel
[02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:04.960]  i'm a jew my whole family uh married
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:06.400]  someone's not jewish but i have my whole
[02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:07.840]  family back to
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:09.920]  whatever is jewish i'm very
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:11.200]  uncomfortable with israel i think they're
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:12.480]  engaged i don't i'm not gonna get the
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:13.600]  political stuff but like i'm very
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:15.120]  uncomfortable israel let's leave it there
[02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:15.600]  right
[02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:17.680]  it is very difficult to have any sane
[02:10:17.680 --> 02:10:18.960]  and sensible conversation about
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:20.080]  palestinians
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:22.560]  arabs and israel with any combination of
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:24.560]  people other jews non-jews
[02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:27.280]  muslims whatever no two people can get
[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:29.360]  together and talk without somebody
[02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:31.680]  chiding you for some opinion about it no
[02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:33.120]  matter what your stance is
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:34.720]  and there is that's sort of a problem
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:36.080]  with race in america too it's very
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:37.680]  difficult to have a discussion
[02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:39.840]  because no two people can agree how to
[02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:41.280]  talk about it without essentially
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:43.120]  accusing each other of engaging in
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:44.400]  something that is a form of political
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:45.120]  correctness
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:47.280]  going out of your way to specifically
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:48.320]  knowingly
[02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:51.200]  inflict emotional harm or inspire
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:52.880]  threats against somebody
[02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:54.480]  even when you do it with a way that's
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:55.840]  plausibly deniable that is not
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:56.800]  convincing at all
[02:10:56.800 --> 02:10:59.120]  there's no question what that is so if
[02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:00.000]  milo
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.400]  were super left-wing and thought it was
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:03.200]  funny to
[02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:05.600]  go after you anisomatic things against
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:07.280]  jewish actress or something
[02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:09.040]  right um and i'm saying that not that
[02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:10.160]  the left is all anti-semitic but it's
[02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:11.360]  the closest you're not going to have
[02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:13.120]  left-wing people go after black people
[02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:14.560]  typically but you know that happens too
[02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:15.840]  you have issues with intersectional
[02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:17.120]  feminism
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:18.400]  i won't go into that but anyway so it
[02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:19.520]  doesn't i don't think it's a political
[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:21.440]  thing he's not raising a conservative
[02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:22.400]  point
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:24.720]  against leslie he's not raising an issue
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:26.080]  even about the movie like he has a
[02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:28.160]  cultural the whole gamergate movement
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:30.080]  alt-right merged together with it and
[02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:32.000]  even the ghostbusters thing has to do
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:32.560]  with
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:34.560]  people who feel like that people who
[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:35.680]  were in a what they thought was a
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:37.360]  majority situation never felt the
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:39.040]  benefits of privilege and now reject
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:40.480]  entirely the notion
[02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:42.800]  that they have any privilege but so
[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:43.840]  there's a structural
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:46.560]  cultural argument there that he that the
[02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:48.240]  basis of which is a ghostbusters is a
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:49.680]  terrible thing because of but that is
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:51.360]  not a conservative viewpoint but he's
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:54.640]  he's parlaying off the the
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:57.760]  his followers actually i think is the
[02:11:57.760 --> 02:11:58.960]  point you're trying to make actually
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:00.400]  well-founded concern that political
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:01.680]  correctness
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:04.640]  the dial right now is set too far and
[02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:05.280]  that
[02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:06.720]  things that should we should be able to
[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:08.400]  have discussion about we
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:09.920]  feel like you can't right it's funny but
[02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:11.440]  whatever political correctness is raised
[02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:12.480]  it's always about issues where i'm like
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:13.680]  that's not political correctness that's
[02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:14.720]  someone wanting to say something
[02:12:14.720 --> 02:12:15.440]  offensive
[02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:17.120]  and not liking the consequences as
[02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:18.960]  opposed to a valid
[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:20.160]  when i say valid everyone will have
[02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:21.440]  valid differently this is the thing i
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:22.960]  want to get out with speech too is
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:24.480]  i wrote this long screen a few days ago
[02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:26.560]  i wrote like 40 tweets in a tweet storm i
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:27.520]  thought i was going to write two
[02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:30.720]  you wrote it really no it's crazy right
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:31.760]  and i got a remarkable amount of
[02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:32.880]  response but i thought people wouldn't
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:34.160]  listen i just had to say it because
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:35.360]  after leslie jen's thing
[02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:36.960]  and it's like i think there's a clear
[02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:38.560]  difference and i i don't study the first
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:40.080]  amendment so i can't tell you where this
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:41.440]  sits in law there's probably people have
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:42.560]  this more to define
[02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:44.240]  there's offensive speech and then
[02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:45.760]  there's like abusive
[02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:47.920]  hate threatening speech right and hate
[02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:49.360]  speech is a difficult thing under the
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:51.040]  first amendment because the first minute
[02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:51.920]  so broad but
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:54.400]  i think twitter um should not encourage
[02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:55.840]  offensive speech but i think it should
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:57.760]  allow it and when i say offensive things
[02:12:57.760 --> 02:12:59.520]  you don't want to hear are offensive
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:00.880]  and sometimes those things are very
[02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:03.040]  offensive if somebody wants to on their
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:03.840]  own account
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:06.800]  not adding me say um and not talking
[02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:08.400]  about me let's say let's do the best case
[02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:08.880]  they say
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:10.960]  there are nazis who want to say jews are
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:12.320]  terrible i think they should all go to a
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:14.320]  gas oven i wish this would happen i hate
[02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:16.080]  the fact the world is run by jews
[02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:17.680]  if somebody wants to say that well
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:19.440]  that's very general it's awful
[02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:20.960]  it's offensive i don't want to hear it i
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:22.320]  don't have to follow them
[02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:24.720]  if rather they're using their account to
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:26.560]  exchange information to create you know
[02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:28.560]  to organize around notions of hate to
[02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:29.360]  create
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:32.800]  um not even to create policies but to uh
[02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:34.320]  to threaten other people to gain
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:35.760]  strength that allows them to then
[02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:37.280]  practice hate speech against other
[02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:37.920]  people
[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:39.760]  um or if they're using their twitter
[02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:42.240]  accounts even as like coded ways to
[02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:44.400]  organize or promote things that they
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:46.160]  link to on websites or everyone knows on
[02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:47.520]  a website and there's some
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:48.960]  question with milo about like what he's
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:50.320]  posting on bright part versus what he's
[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:51.440]  doing on twitter and he may be more
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:52.720]  careful on twitter
[02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:55.440]  to not be as uh you know provocative in
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:56.240]  some ways as he
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:13:58.080]  was on bright part even like that's a
[02:13:58.080 --> 02:14:00.800]  different thing so like i don't so
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:03.120]  even if nothing milo said specifically
[02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:04.480]  individually
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:08.000]  if it weren't sent to uh leslie
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:12.080]  was offensive like vile but not actually
[02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:13.920]  abusive that maybe there's a case made
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:15.200]  that that person and there's some there's
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:15.680]  some
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:17.680]  gray area there about saying things you
[02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:18.640]  don't want to hear because john there's
[02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:19.840]  tons of things that people say that you
[02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:20.720]  don't want to hear
[02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:22.320]  that are valid political opinions that
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:23.680]  you wouldn't say that person should be
[02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:24.880]  banned unless
[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:26.640]  you actually wanted to decrease free
[02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:29.520]  speech right it's a very different thing
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:31.200]  and you know it's a funny thing it just
[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:32.480]  isn't it it's
[02:14:32.480 --> 02:14:34.720]  a subset of these people seem to really
[02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:36.080]  think that free speech
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:40.240]  is uh that
[02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:42.080]  that it's absolute that you they should
[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:43.600]  be able to do whatever they want say
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:45.120]  what say whatever they want to whatever
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:47.120]  they want and if they want to at reply
[02:14:47.120 --> 02:14:49.360]  glenn that you should be put in an oven
[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:50.560]  they should be allowed to
[02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:52.240]  and you know you you should figure out
[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:53.280]  how to filter it if you don't want to
[02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:55.280]  see it it's your that it's your problem
[02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:57.360]  and i say that's hogwash that's it's
[02:14:57.360 --> 02:14:58.720]  absolute nonsense
[02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:02.240]  uh and i know these analogies
[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:03.760]  for between the online world in the real
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:05.280]  world always break down they
[02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:07.520]  there's always because you know that it
[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:09.440]  online is so totally different
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:11.600]  but like my analogy was that nobody
[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:12.960]  would ever tolerate a restaurant
[02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:15.280]  no no no no sane restaurant would ever
[02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:16.640]  tolerate allowing
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:19.280]  a person to come in and harass fellow
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:19.920]  patrons
[02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:23.040]  and just go up and uh you know
[02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:25.920]  uh you know make disparaging remarks
[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:27.680]  about the color of their skin
[02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:31.680]  or that uh you know that they seem to be
[02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:34.080]  same-sex couple or whatever for anything
[02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:34.960]  you wouldn't
[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:36.720]  why would you allow that it would be it
[02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:39.120]  would be toxic and that's exactly
[02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:43.120]  what these storms of people harassing
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:45.040]  people on twitter are all about that's
[02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:46.800]  why leslie jones he's an exact he said if
[02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:48.080]  i'm in a restaurant she says exactly the
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:48.800]  same thing so
[02:15:48.800 --> 02:15:50.720]  maybe she read my restaurant i'm in a
[02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:52.560]  restaurant and a couple people are shot
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:53.600]  in front of me
[02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:55.520]  like that's the restaurant's problem
[02:15:55.520 --> 02:15:56.880]  that's not my problem i want to eat
[02:15:56.880 --> 02:15:58.080]  there that's what i like the restaurant i
[02:15:58.080 --> 02:15:58.960]  want to come back
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:00.320]  but if people are gonna be shot there
[02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:02.320]  i'm not going to go there and
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:04.080]  yeah i think there's also this the free
[02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:05.680]  speech is not the right to be heard it's
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:06.640]  the right to talk
[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:09.920]  so here's here's what i see i see that
[02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:13.840]  it it is actually hard to
[02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:16.640]  uh behave anti-socially in the real
[02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:17.360]  world
[02:16:17.360 --> 02:16:20.240]  especially after you get out of the
[02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:21.040]  older you get
[02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:23.440]  it's you know kindergarten there's a lot
[02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:24.800]  of anti-social behavior
[02:16:24.800 --> 02:16:26.400]  and as you work your way through high
[02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:28.800]  school it decreases but there's often
[02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:30.160]  you know a lot of people have memories
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:30.880]  of a lot of
[02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:33.440]  anti-social tormentors in you know
[02:16:33.440 --> 02:16:34.960]  middle school and high school
[02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:37.120]  um and then all of a sudden it just
[02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:38.480]  magically goes away when you go to
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:39.040]  college
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:42.000]  and in the real world in most venues it
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:43.840]  is extremely difficult to behave
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:44.720]  anti-socially
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:47.840]  there's all sorts of
[02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:49.680]  social pressure and there's physical
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:51.040]  pressure like if you behave the way some
[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:52.480]  of these people behave on twitter in the
[02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:53.840]  real world there's a very good chance
[02:16:53.840 --> 02:16:55.040]  that you'd get punched
[02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:56.640]  i mean it i mean oh yeah you would
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:16:58.000]  actually get
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.800]  punched like if so for example here's an
[02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:01.680]  example
[02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:04.240]  uh you and i both know an awful lot of
[02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:04.800]  uh
[02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:06.480]  we've seen it in the last year or two
[02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:08.240]  we've seen women
[02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:11.120]  uh who get you know stand up and speak
[02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:12.480]  out on
[02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:15.280]  um on something that upsets these people
[02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:15.760]  and then
[02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:17.520]  they get literally told literally
[02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:19.120]  threatened with rape or death
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:22.480]  in a tweet at at insert you know
[02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:25.360]  the username uh you know i know where
[02:17:25.360 --> 02:17:26.080]  you live
[02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:28.960]  uh you're gonna get raped uh if you did
[02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:30.720]  that to somebody in real life there's a
[02:17:30.720 --> 02:17:31.280]  very good
[02:17:31.280 --> 02:17:34.240]  chance well you should be like arrested
[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:35.440]  uh but if like
[02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:37.680]  if somebody did that to my wife i would
[02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:39.600]  you know i would be prepared to punch the
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:40.400]  guy
[02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:41.920]  like because that's a dangerous situation
[02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:43.680]  people don't do that i mean
[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:46.240]  it just doesn't happen so for these
[02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:48.160]  people who for whatever reason
[02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:50.400]  in their minds want to behave
[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:51.680]  anti-socially
[02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:53.680]  the online world and we've known this
[02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:55.040]  you know like you said you've been on
[02:17:55.040 --> 02:17:57.040]  compu serve since 1968
[02:17:57.040 --> 02:17:58.720]  i mean the online world has seen this
[02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:00.560]  from the beginning days that it there's
[02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:02.320]  anti-social behavior that you just
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:03.600]  don't encounter in the real world
[02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:05.440]  because you there's no
[02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:07.520]  there are no repercussions you can get
[02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:09.520]  away with it you can do it
[02:18:09.520 --> 02:18:12.640]  so people have gotten into these
[02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:15.520]  hordes that that harass people and they
[02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:17.440]  seem to enjoy doing it
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:19.600]  and what they're being told now like
[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:21.200]  with this milo getting kicked off
[02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:22.640]  twitter is no you can't do it
[02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:24.880]  well if they can't do it then they're
[02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:25.840]  all of a sudden they don't have an
[02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:28.880]  outlet for this anti-social behavior
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:30.720]  and part of it too is that you can
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:32.400]  behave you can go off into
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:34.800]  uh what's the 4chan or whatever and just
[02:18:34.800 --> 02:18:36.640]  hang out hang out with your fellow
[02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:40.160]  uh uh you know sickos
[02:18:40.160 --> 02:18:42.720]  and do this the the beauty of twitter
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:43.760]  from this these
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:45.760]  these weirdos perspective is that they
[02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:47.280]  can at reply these
[02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:50.560]  these women and minorities and
[02:18:50.560 --> 02:18:54.080]  get their uh get their jollies by
[02:18:54.080 --> 02:18:55.520]  knowing that the people who check their
[02:18:55.520 --> 02:18:56.640]  replies are going to see it
[02:18:56.640 --> 02:18:58.880]  and then when they engage it's like they
[02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:00.000]  just go bananas
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:01.520]  because it's like they know then it's
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:03.200]  confirmation like once they knew that
[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:04.800]  leslie jones was actually seeing this
[02:19:04.800 --> 02:19:05.520]  stuff and
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:07.200]  reacting to it it just made it worse
[02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:09.120]  because this is exactly what they want
[02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:10.000]  to do they want to
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:13.200]  behave in an extremely uh almost
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:14.400]  sociopathic way
[02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:16.320]  and they can and there's no other outlet
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:18.000]  for it in the world and so now that
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:19.360]  twitter is standing you know so they're
[02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:20.800]  standing behind free speech but what
[02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:22.400]  they really want is
[02:19:22.400 --> 02:19:24.640]  they want their uh special bullying
[02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:25.520]  venue
[02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:28.320]  to remain available special bullying
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:30.240]  venue is probably not what twitter wants
[02:19:30.240 --> 02:19:30.800]  as it's
[02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:32.960]  no definitely shouldn't but that's the
[02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:34.480]  way these guys see twitter that is
[02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:35.360]  exactly the
[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:36.880]  way they see twitter there's a high
[02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:38.640]  degree of asymmetricality in twitter
[02:19:38.640 --> 02:19:39.920]  that could be changed and uh
[02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:42.080]  randy harper knows i've been working on
[02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:43.600]  tools i use her uh
[02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:45.680]  good uh what's called uh good game
[02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:47.760]  blocklist i forget gg autoblocker
[02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:50.080]  um with uh block together is the tool
[02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:51.600]  and so you subscribe block together is a
[02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:52.480]  web app
[02:19:52.480 --> 02:19:54.960]  with a twitter api integration you log
[02:19:54.960 --> 02:19:55.600]  into it
[02:19:55.600 --> 02:19:57.360]  and then you can add shared lists of
[02:19:57.360 --> 02:19:58.560]  other people you and other people
[02:19:58.560 --> 02:20:00.160]  maintain and you can set a few throttles
[02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:00.800]  and things
[02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:02.400]  so block together exists it's a third
[02:20:02.400 --> 02:20:03.920]  party thing twitter allows it
[02:20:03.920 --> 02:20:05.680]  and they're like 12 000 people on
[02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:07.760]  randy's list that are auto generated from
[02:20:07.760 --> 02:20:09.600]  people who follow a few major accounts
[02:20:09.600 --> 02:20:10.880]  which will change because one of those
[02:20:10.880 --> 02:20:13.120]  few major accounts was milos so
[02:20:13.120 --> 02:20:15.520]  which was at nero um and oh twitter by
[02:20:15.520 --> 02:20:16.640]  the way when it blocked
[02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:17.760]  permanently suspended account that
[02:20:17.760 --> 02:20:19.520]  account is dead forever at nero will
[02:20:19.520 --> 02:20:20.560]  never be used again
[02:20:20.560 --> 02:20:22.080]  right now and so the sun burns out
[02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:23.840]  potentially uh
[02:20:23.840 --> 02:20:26.080]  so anyway so i the randy harper wrote
[02:20:26.080 --> 02:20:27.520]  this thing i just someone asked me that
[02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:28.240]  the other day it's
[02:20:28.240 --> 02:20:29.840]  in february is a medium piece you can
[02:20:29.840 --> 02:20:31.760]  search for randy harper medium twitter
[02:20:31.760 --> 02:20:32.560]  ideas and
[02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:33.920]  uh finding the show notes if you put in
[02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:34.960]  i don't know whatever but she had like
[02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:36.160]  23 ideas
[02:20:36.160 --> 02:20:38.160]  for twitter she's a developer she's been
[02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:39.520]  working against her api she's
[02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:41.440]  met with them she's knows how
[02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:43.120]  everything works on the you know
[02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:45.280]  the outside of the black box she knows
[02:20:45.280 --> 02:20:46.080]  it as well as
[02:20:46.080 --> 02:20:48.160]  anybody trying to develop anti-abusive
[02:20:48.160 --> 02:20:49.920]  tools the stuff she mentioned some of
[02:20:49.920 --> 02:20:51.760]  it's trivial some of it's harder she's
[02:20:51.760 --> 02:20:53.440]  not sure the severity
[02:20:53.440 --> 02:20:55.920]  of work required for all of it but those
[02:20:55.920 --> 02:20:57.040]  things are still out there
[02:20:57.040 --> 02:20:58.960]  and so the issue with twitter isn't so
[02:20:58.960 --> 02:21:00.320]  much that people can gang together and
[02:21:00.320 --> 02:21:01.200]  abuse it's that
[02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:04.320]  you as a party receiving it it is bad at
[02:21:04.320 --> 02:21:06.240]  asymmetrical warfare where someone can
[02:21:06.240 --> 02:21:06.720]  get
[02:21:06.720 --> 02:21:08.320]  a hundred someone can either create a
[02:21:08.320 --> 02:21:10.000]  thousand accounts and tweet at you
[02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:11.760]  or get a hundred thousand people like the
[02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:13.600]  the twitch twitchy
[02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:14.800]  there's a conservative site and they
[02:21:14.800 --> 02:21:16.480]  will often say basically
[02:21:16.480 --> 02:21:18.080]  that person is bad and then all the
[02:21:18.080 --> 02:21:19.600]  people who follow twitchy or go to the
[02:21:19.600 --> 02:21:20.240]  website
[02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:22.160]  will go off i get i say i'll say uh
[02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:24.080]  respond to something sally cohen
[02:21:24.080 --> 02:21:26.000]  says uh you know i have a little back
[02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:27.440]  and forth with her about something and
[02:21:27.440 --> 02:21:28.240]  we're being
[02:21:28.240 --> 02:21:29.520]  funny or whatever i think i'm being
[02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:31.120]  funny and i will suddenly get all these
[02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:32.720]  people who hate follow sally cohen
[02:21:32.720 --> 02:21:34.400]  i've never been targeted by twitchy yet
[02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:35.600]  for as far as i know
[02:21:35.600 --> 02:21:38.560]  uh and uh i get like you know 100 or 200
[02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:40.240]  tweets from people who don't spell and
[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:41.760]  have flags in their bios and
[02:21:41.760 --> 02:21:43.920]  just like you're before blah blah blah
[02:21:43.920 --> 02:21:45.040]  you know it's like it's not even
[02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:46.240]  intelligible
[02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:48.240]  it's just like random anger there's
[02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:49.600]  nothing i can do to stop it except
[02:21:49.600 --> 02:21:51.120]  blocking one at a time even the auto
[02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:52.800]  block lists don't help me so
[02:21:52.800 --> 02:21:54.320]  if there were tools like if you started
[02:21:54.320 --> 02:21:55.840]  getting a lot of tweets you could like
[02:21:55.840 --> 02:21:57.440]  if there were dials and tools you could
[02:21:57.440 --> 02:21:58.320]  adjust
[02:21:58.320 --> 02:21:59.600]  there are things that could happen that
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:01.040]  would allow that would either
[02:22:01.040 --> 02:22:02.080]  temporarily or
[02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:03.920]  as a permanent block you could prevent
[02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:05.520]  the course tool that titter twitter is
[02:22:05.520 --> 02:22:06.560]  going towards is that thing i was
[02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:08.000]  talking about they have an app i forgot
[02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:08.880]  what it's called
[02:22:08.880 --> 02:22:10.400]  they could at least a separate app that's
[02:22:10.400 --> 02:22:11.840]  basically it's good if you have a
[02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:13.920]  verified account works fine otherwise
[02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:16.000]  but it's a little tailored towards being
[02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:17.520]  a verified person with a
[02:22:17.520 --> 02:22:20.480]  large number of followers and
[02:22:20.480 --> 02:22:22.080]  mostly posting rather than doing a ton
[02:22:22.080 --> 02:22:23.840]  of interaction with everybody um
[02:22:23.840 --> 02:22:26.640]  i've forgotten the name of it but uh so
[02:22:26.640 --> 02:22:28.160]  twitter just the other day said they're
[02:22:28.160 --> 02:22:29.440]  going to open a verification to
[02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:30.800]  everybody with a
[02:22:30.800 --> 02:22:32.320]  opaque process that i think involves
[02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:34.080]  sending a picture id to them so you're
[02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:35.360]  going to give them your od
[02:22:35.360 --> 02:22:38.160]  so conceivably this is one step on the
[02:22:38.160 --> 02:22:39.920]  road to more people being verified and
[02:22:39.920 --> 02:22:41.440]  what if there are the hundred thousand
[02:22:41.440 --> 02:22:42.160]  most
[02:22:42.160 --> 02:22:44.480]  prolific engaged twitter people are all
[02:22:44.480 --> 02:22:46.320]  verified well that can be removed
[02:22:46.320 --> 02:22:48.320]  as well so maybe twitter is moving
[02:22:48.320 --> 02:22:49.920]  towards a more asymmetrical model where
[02:22:49.920 --> 02:22:51.200]  we're only following we give up
[02:22:51.200 --> 02:22:52.480]  following random people
[02:22:52.480 --> 02:22:54.640]  if you can't be bothered to verify i've
[02:22:54.640 --> 02:22:55.920]  thought for a long time twitter should
[02:22:55.920 --> 02:22:56.720]  offer a
[02:22:56.720 --> 02:22:58.480]  basic level of verification where you
[02:22:58.480 --> 02:23:00.240]  had to use a phone number to confirm
[02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:01.200]  even though phone numbers can be
[02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:02.960]  disposable and whatever it's a high
[02:23:02.960 --> 02:23:03.840]  enough bar
[02:23:03.840 --> 02:23:06.080]  that if you're taking getting a text
[02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:07.280]  from a phone number
[02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:09.360]  you're you know it's a hassle if that
[02:23:09.360 --> 02:23:11.360]  account gets banned or blocked
[02:23:11.360 --> 02:23:12.880]  it's a hassle to get their phone number
[02:23:12.880 --> 02:23:14.640]  you can only get so many you can't get a
[02:23:14.640 --> 02:23:16.640]  10 000 100 000 phone numbers
[02:23:16.640 --> 02:23:18.160]  but they could have some basic level that
[02:23:18.160 --> 02:23:19.920]  doesn't involve sending a photo id
[02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:21.120]  and i could say look i don't want to
[02:23:21.120 --> 02:23:22.160]  deal with people who are completely
[02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:23.840]  anonymous i only want to see people my
[02:23:23.840 --> 02:23:25.600]  timeline who i follow
[02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:27.680]  uh and you know or i could say only
[02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:29.200]  people who follow me
[02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:31.440]  who um i want to see them so i let
[02:23:31.440 --> 02:23:33.040]  people who follow me if they've opted in
[02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:34.080]  because i get most of my hate from
[02:23:34.080 --> 02:23:35.440]  people that don't follow me and i think
[02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:36.720]  that's true in general people don't
[02:23:36.720 --> 02:23:38.160]  follow brianna woo
[02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:39.680]  and then spew hate or they're not
[02:23:39.680 --> 02:23:41.520]  following us
[02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:42.560]  some people do some people follow you
[02:23:42.560 --> 02:23:43.520]  because they think it gives them a
[02:23:43.520 --> 02:23:45.040]  little extra whatever so i only want to
[02:23:45.040 --> 02:23:46.000]  see things in my timeline
[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:47.600]  will follow me because i can block them
[02:23:47.600 --> 02:23:49.120]  um or i could change them there's a
[02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:51.120]  checkbox and from people
[02:23:51.120 --> 02:23:54.240]  or for people who don't follow me who
[02:23:54.240 --> 02:23:55.600]  if they're not retweets from somebody
[02:23:55.600 --> 02:23:57.120]  else that's cool i'll see people who i
[02:23:57.120 --> 02:23:58.160]  follow as retweets but
[02:23:58.160 --> 02:24:00.320]  people who have gone through a very
[02:24:00.320 --> 02:24:01.760]  basic level of verification
[02:24:01.760 --> 02:24:03.360]  that doesn't cost money like i don't
[02:24:03.360 --> 02:24:04.800]  want this to be a first world
[02:24:04.800 --> 02:24:06.800]  developing world thing or whatever um
[02:24:06.800 --> 02:24:07.920]  but there's only things they could do
[02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:09.200]  they could put lots of throttles and
[02:24:09.200 --> 02:24:10.960]  they could be monitoring behavior
[02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:12.560]  john you know there's a setting called
[02:24:12.560 --> 02:24:14.400]  uh filter low quality tweets in your
[02:24:14.400 --> 02:24:16.400]  account right uh no i did not know that
[02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:18.000]  it's only available to verified people
[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:19.520]  so far it's been available for like two
[02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:21.040]  years if you check that
[02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:22.720]  they use their machine learning i think
[02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:24.480]  it's using machine learning to filter
[02:24:24.480 --> 02:24:26.320]  out tweets that look like they aren't
[02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:27.120]  very good
[02:24:27.120 --> 02:24:29.680]  i don't know i don't know i don't know
[02:24:29.680 --> 02:24:31.840]  what it is i think part of it
[02:24:31.840 --> 02:24:36.960]  obviously is that i am a white man
[02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:40.240]  i can do things like write about milo
[02:24:40.240 --> 02:24:42.720]  yanopoulos in a very critical way
[02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:44.800]  and at least knock on wood to date i
[02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:47.040]  don't get i get very i i got responses
[02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:48.480]  in twitter but it wasn't any
[02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:50.000]  i wouldn't call it abuse i mean there
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:51.600]  were people who disagreed and there were
[02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:52.960]  obviously you know people who staunchly
[02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:53.760]  disagreed
[02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:55.920]  and a little bit of it was ugly but i
[02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:57.200]  don't get any kind of mob
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:24:59.440]  no it never happens whereas if i think if
[02:24:59.440 --> 02:25:00.320]  i was
[02:25:00.320 --> 02:25:03.760]  uh you know uh joan gruber
[02:25:03.760 --> 02:25:05.680]  i think there's a very good chance that
[02:25:05.680 --> 02:25:07.840]  i i really do i
[02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:09.920]  b test i've thought about ab testing like
[02:25:09.920 --> 02:25:11.280]  creating a fake account
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:13.120]  that was under the name of a woman with
[02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:14.880]  a woman's face with someone's permission
[02:25:14.880 --> 02:25:16.400]  some people have tried this on like okay
[02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:17.760]  cupid they've gotten a friend's
[02:25:17.760 --> 02:25:19.520]  permission to use their image and just
[02:25:19.520 --> 02:25:20.960]  been like you know but then it becomes i
[02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:22.160]  mean it becomes a stunt i don't want to
[02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:23.360]  be a stunt enough women live through
[02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:24.240]  this people of color
[02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:26.080]  right people with who are not you know
[02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:27.600]  cis male
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:30.080]  straight uh white it's like they already
[02:25:30.080 --> 02:25:31.600]  have enough problems that i don't need
[02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:33.360]  to pretend to do um
[02:25:33.360 --> 02:25:35.040]  like racism tourism or something like
[02:25:35.040 --> 02:25:36.640]  that gender tourism
[02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:38.160]  i should try it though because it would
[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:39.760]  be interesting i actually just by
[02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:41.200]  coincidence last night
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:44.640]  i crafted what i i think i don't know
[02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:45.920]  how else you'd venture it i should go to
[02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:46.880]  fab star
[02:25:46.880 --> 02:25:49.280]  i think i wrote my two most popular
[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:50.480]  tweets of all time
[02:25:50.480 --> 02:25:53.680]  last night no no really yeah and it the
[02:25:53.680 --> 02:25:56.320]  beating my old one which was
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:25:57.920]  um
[02:25:57.920 --> 02:25:59.760]  my original all-time best tweet was like
[02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:00.960]  from 2009
[02:26:00.960 --> 02:26:02.320]  and i said let me see if i can get it
[02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:03.840]  right i said i'm looking it up here i
[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:04.320]  don't
[02:26:04.320 --> 02:26:08.080]  drink i don't gamble
[02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:10.480]  oh yeah and i found i found my one vice
[02:26:10.480 --> 02:26:11.760]  about reading your own tweet to you yeah
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:12.560]  read it
[02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:14.720]  okay i don't drink sorry i don't gamble
[02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:15.760]  i don't drink
[02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:18.080]  my one vice is buying a new iphone every
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:19.120]  summer
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:20.400]  well that and lying about drinking
[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:21.760]  gambling i remember that one that was
[02:26:21.760 --> 02:26:24.480]  great that was 2590 days ago
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:26.640]  yes that's my was previously my
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:27.840]  all-time favorite tweet
[02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:29.760]  but last night after i'm looking at your
[02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:31.200]  numbers this is hilarious
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:32.640]  what are you using to look at them i'm
[02:26:32.640 --> 02:26:34.240]  using fat i like fab star i'm
[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:36.560]  how do i admit i'm just vain enough i'm
[02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:38.720]  looking at oh nick kristoff and
[02:26:38.720 --> 02:26:40.560]  our my friend susan orlean uh both
[02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:41.680]  retweeted it and
[02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:44.880]  chris hayes from msnbc retweeted it yeah
[02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:46.400]  oh i'm looking at one of them oh yes
[02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:48.720]  nick kristoff and nick kristoff did
[02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:50.240]  columnists for the new york times
[02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:52.080]  susan orlean staff writer for the new
[02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:53.280]  york
[02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:56.000]  baratunde yeah it's unbelievable like
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:57.840]  somehow it got into the cycle of like
[02:26:57.840 --> 02:26:59.360]  top political reporters and they all
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:00.560]  retweeted it so
[02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:01.920]  well you're followed by you have an
[02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:02.960]  interesting group of followers it
[02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:04.800]  overlaps and so people who uh
[02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:06.320]  this is what i've had some breakouts
[02:27:06.320 --> 02:27:08.560]  i have like six thousand retweets
[02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:11.280]  which is by like uh 50 times more than
[02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:12.800]  anything i've ever said before
[02:27:12.800 --> 02:27:14.720]  because i made a comment about brexit
[02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:16.800]  um because the morning after i'm like
[02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:18.560]  i'm listening to everything and i'm like
[02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:20.480]  this isn't going to happen like there is
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:22.160]  a plan here
[02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:23.760]  and i wrote something about basically
[02:27:23.760 --> 02:27:25.520]  like brexit you know this could be such
[02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:26.960]  political suicide
[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:29.200]  that that brexit's not going to happen
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:30.880]  it got retweeted like six thousand times
[02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:32.640]  oh my god very interesting responses
[02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:34.720]  those were actually interesting i got
[02:27:34.720 --> 02:27:36.400]  hundreds and hundreds of replies from
[02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:37.760]  people some of them thought i was an
[02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:39.520]  idiot and i and some people thought i
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:40.800]  you know i'm like i don't vote in the uk
[02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:42.080]  i don't have an opinion on this but i
[02:27:42.080 --> 02:27:44.080]  love the uk i want it to succeed
[02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:46.000]  um but i also got very informed things
[02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:47.440]  by people who are who were
[02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:49.680]  torn about it or had voted for remain
[02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:51.840]  anyway but yeah yours blew it this blew
[02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:54.240]  away so i have two tweets one after
[02:27:54.240 --> 02:27:55.600]  another and i connected them with
[02:27:55.600 --> 02:27:57.920]  tweetbots whatever they call it uh let's
[02:27:57.920 --> 02:27:59.680]  play what if
[02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:01.760]  what if barack obama had five children
[02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:03.760]  with three different women
[02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:05.360]  immediately followed by what if hillary
[02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:07.040]  clinton had five children with three
[02:28:07.040 --> 02:28:08.080]  different fathers
[02:28:08.080 --> 02:28:10.320]  i thought those were pretty brilliant i
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:11.920]  was you know what's funny and this is
[02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:14.000]  not to not credit you with originality
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:15.600]  and wit because you have a lot of it i'm
[02:28:15.600 --> 02:28:16.880]  gonna butter you up
[02:28:16.880 --> 02:28:19.200]  but when i saw that i was like oh my god
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:20.880]  is no one tweeted that before
[02:28:20.880 --> 02:28:22.480]  because the minute you say it it's
[02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:24.080]  absolutely obvious
[02:28:24.080 --> 02:28:24.880]  because they're all you know they're on
[02:28:24.880 --> 02:28:26.560]  stage the five kids are on stage and
[02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:27.440]  you're like
[02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:30.160]  holy crap but like nobody had said it as
[02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:32.080]  succinctly and with the perfect timing
[02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:34.560]  as you add right and so i did my
[02:28:34.560 --> 02:28:36.480]  uh at reply you know so the one tweet
[02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:38.400]  the one mentioned the one with
[02:28:38.400 --> 02:28:40.800]  the first one with barack obama has uh
[02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:42.080]  3100
[02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:43.760]  retweets and then the hillary clinton one
[02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:46.160]  has 3834 retweets
[02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:48.400]  so i even though i have an unusual
[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:49.440]  twitter account and a large number of
[02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:50.560]  followers i
[02:28:50.560 --> 02:28:52.400]  had two tweets that were obviously a
[02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:55.920]  little uh
[02:28:55.920 --> 02:28:58.960]  provocative uh presented to an awful lot
[02:28:58.960 --> 02:28:59.680]  more people
[02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:01.280]  who you then who usually read my tweets
[02:29:01.280 --> 02:29:02.320]  my tweets and so
[02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:05.040]  my current at reply stream is i can't
[02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:06.560]  get to the bot i can't keep up with it
[02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:07.840]  right now it must be out of control i'm
[02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:08.880]  looking at yeah when i look at the
[02:29:08.880 --> 02:29:09.920]  people who've retweeted it
[02:29:09.920 --> 02:29:11.040]  there's a bunch of people in there that
[02:29:11.040 --> 02:29:12.960]  i know like uh mike montero and john
[02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:14.320]  syracusea and
[02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:15.680]  people are definitely the tech side of
[02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:17.680]  things uh and then you know so it's a
[02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:18.160]  lot of the
[02:29:18.160 --> 02:29:20.000]  lot of the folks and then like i mean
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:21.760]  looking at the top retweets and then
[02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:23.040]  it's a lot of just really interesting
[02:29:23.040 --> 02:29:24.480]  people who obviously found this another
[02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:26.480]  thing but some of them have 50 000 60
[02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:28.080]  000
[02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:29.840]  excuse me there's an incredible i mean
[02:29:29.840 --> 02:29:31.120]  this is what's interesting about twitter
[02:29:31.120 --> 02:29:32.560]  is like it makes everyone
[02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:34.320]  have the ability to be a pundit or to be
[02:29:34.320 --> 02:29:36.000]  a stand-up comedian and reach an
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:36.960]  audience they don't
[02:29:36.960 --> 02:29:38.720]  otherwise and it's like sometimes you
[02:29:38.720 --> 02:29:39.840]  feel like you're shouting to the void
[02:29:39.840 --> 02:29:40.560]  like there's times
[02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:42.160]  max temkin asked me you know from uh
[02:29:42.160 --> 02:29:43.440]  cards against humanity he asked me i
[02:29:43.440 --> 02:29:44.800]  don't know a while ago he's like
[02:29:44.800 --> 02:29:46.080]  you know everybody follows you agrees
[02:29:46.080 --> 02:29:47.440]  with what you're saying do you feel
[02:29:47.440 --> 02:29:49.200]  compelled to say it and he wasn't he was
[02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:50.800]  mildly castigating because i'd gone on
[02:29:50.800 --> 02:29:52.000]  about something
[02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:53.600]  and uh and i was like uh you know i did
[02:29:53.600 --> 02:29:55.520]  go on about something i'm like you know
[02:29:55.520 --> 02:29:57.280]  i don't think everyone who follows me
[02:29:57.280 --> 02:29:58.400]  actually like i don't know how many
[02:29:58.400 --> 02:29:59.920]  people who follow me read every tweet
[02:29:59.920 --> 02:30:01.840]  it's a percentage i look at twitter
[02:30:01.840 --> 02:30:03.520]  nobody i'm sorry that's i didn't mean to
[02:30:03.520 --> 02:30:05.280]  be such a trigger i meant more like you
[02:30:05.280 --> 02:30:06.400]  can use twitter analytics
[02:30:06.400 --> 02:30:08.320]  anyone can log in and you actually get
[02:30:08.320 --> 02:30:09.760]  to see the impressions like what
[02:30:09.760 --> 02:30:11.120]  percentage of your audience
[02:30:11.120 --> 02:30:12.640]  sees it and it's fascinating it's good
[02:30:12.640 --> 02:30:14.480]  it's good and bad for the ego too
[02:30:14.480 --> 02:30:16.640]  um we gotta wrap up okay there's there's
[02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:17.920]  things that yes
[02:30:17.920 --> 02:30:19.520]  so there's things that i say where i'm
[02:30:19.520 --> 02:30:21.440]  glad at times to be able to say
[02:30:21.440 --> 02:30:23.040]  i just need to say this because i want
[02:30:23.040 --> 02:30:24.240]  other people to know that other people
[02:30:24.240 --> 02:30:25.760]  feel it
[02:30:25.760 --> 02:30:28.080]  uh
[02:30:28.080 --> 02:30:29.760]  i at the bottom line twitter has got to
[02:30:29.760 --> 02:30:32.240]  get a handle on this it cannot just be
[02:30:32.240 --> 02:30:33.360]  something that they address
[02:30:33.360 --> 02:30:35.600]  when it's somebody of leslie jones's
[02:30:35.600 --> 02:30:37.680]  stature this needs to be something that
[02:30:37.680 --> 02:30:39.120]  everybody feels
[02:30:39.120 --> 02:30:41.040]  like they're not going to be abused not
[02:30:41.040 --> 02:30:43.200]  and i agree there is a fine line and it
[02:30:43.200 --> 02:30:44.560]  is worrisome in twitter and it's
[02:30:44.560 --> 02:30:45.600]  difficult and i
[02:30:45.600 --> 02:30:47.760]  i trust that it can be done which is
[02:30:47.760 --> 02:30:49.040]  there should not
[02:30:49.040 --> 02:30:52.320]  try to prevent offensive speech
[02:30:52.320 --> 02:30:54.800]  or ideas that some people find offensive
[02:30:54.800 --> 02:30:56.720]  for being expressed on twitter
[02:30:56.720 --> 02:30:58.800]  but they should absolutely make it seem
[02:30:58.800 --> 02:31:00.880]  as though people are not going to be
[02:31:00.880 --> 02:31:02.000]  attacked and they're
[02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:03.360]  the different human being i don't know
[02:31:03.360 --> 02:31:04.960]  if you could do it all algorithmically i
[02:31:04.960 --> 02:31:05.680]  really don't
[02:31:05.680 --> 02:31:07.360]  i think you can use some algorithms to
[02:31:07.360 --> 02:31:09.600]  help but i think when somebody reports
[02:31:09.600 --> 02:31:11.280]  abuse i think somebody at twitter who
[02:31:11.280 --> 02:31:13.840]  has any bit of empathy can easily discern
[02:31:13.840 --> 02:31:16.880]  this is just an offensive idea at versus
[02:31:16.880 --> 02:31:20.000]  this is a personal attack on
[02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.320]  this other user and some of its some of
[02:31:22.320 --> 02:31:24.080]  its nuance but when a thousand accounts
[02:31:24.080 --> 02:31:25.600]  with fewer than 100 followers
[02:31:25.600 --> 02:31:27.680]  all tweet within a few minutes of each
[02:31:27.680 --> 02:31:28.960]  other at one account
[02:31:28.960 --> 02:31:30.400]  i think machines can learn what that
[02:31:30.400 --> 02:31:32.720]  means and i would even be in favor of in
[02:31:32.720 --> 02:31:34.480]  terms of the nuance of
[02:31:34.480 --> 02:31:37.360]  if there's any doubt you know don't
[02:31:37.360 --> 02:31:39.680]  suspend the account right right but but
[02:31:39.680 --> 02:31:41.040]  it's so many cases where it's
[02:31:41.040 --> 02:31:43.040]  easily should be recognized and the
[02:31:43.040 --> 02:31:44.320]  other thing that twitter cannot you can
[02:31:44.320 --> 02:31:45.600]  say well there's a scaling problem there
[02:31:45.600 --> 02:31:47.440]  twitter has an enormous headcount
[02:31:47.440 --> 02:31:49.360]  uh it it's i don't know how sustainable
[02:31:49.360 --> 02:31:50.640]  that is i think it's
[02:31:50.640 --> 02:31:52.240]  it's you know we could do a whole segment
[02:31:52.240 --> 02:31:53.440]  on the show about it is why in the world
[02:31:53.440 --> 02:31:54.720]  does twitter have so many employees
[02:31:54.720 --> 02:31:56.240]  because it doesn't seem like there's
[02:31:56.240 --> 02:31:58.400]  much new stuff going on they they
[02:31:58.400 --> 02:31:59.920]  certainly have the resources to hire a
[02:31:59.920 --> 02:32:02.480]  staff that can look into this abuse
[02:32:02.480 --> 02:32:03.920]  and i think it absolutely needs to be
[02:32:03.920 --> 02:32:05.600]  done and it ties into the amazon thing
[02:32:05.600 --> 02:32:06.560]  where it really
[02:32:06.560 --> 02:32:08.000]  is hurting twitter's reputation where
[02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:09.520]  twitter is get more and more getting a
[02:32:09.520 --> 02:32:10.880]  reputation as a place where if you
[02:32:10.880 --> 02:32:11.840]  participate
[02:32:11.840 --> 02:32:15.600]  you especially as a woman uh
[02:32:15.600 --> 02:32:16.960]  you're you have a very good chance of
[02:32:16.960 --> 02:32:19.440]  being abused that's right twitter spends
[02:32:19.440 --> 02:32:20.560]  literally hundreds of millions of
[02:32:20.560 --> 02:32:22.480]  dollars a year literally hundreds of
[02:32:22.480 --> 02:32:24.880]  millions dollars a year on rnd it's um
[02:32:24.880 --> 02:32:26.320]  it's astonishing i don't know what
[02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:28.240]  exactly they can as rnd but it's a big
[02:32:28.240 --> 02:32:30.240]  part of their expense so they're working
[02:32:30.240 --> 02:32:32.000]  on it but yep
[02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:33.600]  bottom line anyway glenn thanks for

[02:32:48.240 --> 02:32:50.400]  get i have six slacks i'm part of and
[02:32:50.400 --> 02:32:51.520]  some of them thankfully are not very
[02:32:51.520 --> 02:32:52.960]  loud but i like them all but it can get
[02:32:52.960 --> 02:32:53.760]  out of control
[02:32:53.760 --> 02:32:55.680]  so yeah my friends at the take control
[02:32:55.680 --> 02:32:57.200]  books adam and tanya
[02:32:57.200 --> 02:32:59.280]  angst long time mac folks um we were
[02:32:59.280 --> 02:33:00.800]  talking about like we started using it
[02:33:00.800 --> 02:33:01.760]  and it's like uh
[02:33:01.760 --> 02:33:04.240]  it's it's not quite like pokemon go but
[02:33:04.240 --> 02:33:05.600]  it's not that addictive but boy
[02:33:05.600 --> 02:33:07.840]  it went from zero to you know millions
[02:33:07.840 --> 02:33:08.720]  really quickly
[02:33:08.720 --> 02:33:10.400]  and we were complaining amongst
[02:33:10.400 --> 02:33:11.920]  ourselves like how do we do this what's
[02:33:11.920 --> 02:33:13.280]  this thing we're like oh
[02:33:13.280 --> 02:33:14.880]  if we can't figure this out and we've
[02:33:14.880 --> 02:33:16.400]  used a thousand software packages in our
[02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:18.080]  life perhaps it would be useful
[02:33:18.080 --> 02:33:20.720]  to do a book so i did a book that's uh
[02:33:20.720 --> 02:33:22.320]  take control of slack basics
[02:33:22.320 --> 02:33:24.960]  that is for um people who are users who
[02:33:24.960 --> 02:33:26.560]  want to be able to master it because the
[02:33:26.560 --> 02:33:27.680]  online documentation
[02:33:27.680 --> 02:33:29.360]  it's good our friend matt howie he's you
[02:33:29.360 --> 02:33:31.280]  know involved in documentation some
[02:33:31.280 --> 02:33:33.600]  aspect of meta filters founder great guy
[02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:36.400]  and now uh slack's head of documentation
[02:33:36.400 --> 02:33:38.240]  or something yeah
[02:33:38.240 --> 02:33:39.840]  they're working on their side but like
[02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:41.760]  they have he writes for slack yeah they
[02:33:41.760 --> 02:33:42.480]  do a different
[02:33:42.480 --> 02:33:44.000]  they do a different thing like online
[02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:45.600]  documentation is not
[02:33:45.600 --> 02:33:47.600]  like uh what a take control book is about
[02:33:47.600 --> 02:33:48.880]  like they're experientially different
[02:33:48.880 --> 02:33:50.000]  things as you know you've worked on
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:51.520]  manuals working on stuff and so
[02:33:51.520 --> 02:33:53.040]  i wrote a book that's like it's divided
[02:33:53.040 --> 02:33:54.400]  into subjects using channels and
[02:33:54.400 --> 02:33:56.560]  messages and even how to do emoji and so
[02:33:56.560 --> 02:33:57.440]  forth and it's
[02:33:57.440 --> 02:33:59.520]  the idea is you wake up one morning so
[02:33:59.520 --> 02:34:01.120]  many people i know this happened to
[02:34:01.120 --> 02:34:04.000]  you're 30 years old 40 50 and everyone's
[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:05.760]  you get a message from the office
[02:34:05.760 --> 02:34:07.200]  uh we're using slack starting today
[02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:08.560]  you're like oh god not another piece of
[02:34:08.560 --> 02:34:10.240]  software so the book is partly
[02:34:10.240 --> 02:34:12.560]  for people who has sort of slack thrown
[02:34:12.560 --> 02:34:13.840]  at them and other you know also for
[02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:15.040]  people who want to
[02:34:15.040 --> 02:34:17.680]  master it without having to go through
[02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:19.040]  and sort of discover everything there's
[02:34:19.040 --> 02:34:20.160]  a lot of stuff in there
[02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:21.600]  and then i wrote a complimentary book
[02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:23.680]  that's how to set up a slack
[02:34:23.680 --> 02:34:25.280]  team which is pretty straightforward in
[02:34:25.280 --> 02:34:26.960]  some ways there's a lot of detail
[02:34:26.960 --> 02:34:28.400]  um and so if you don't have an it
[02:34:28.400 --> 02:34:29.840]  organization behind you but you want to
[02:34:29.840 --> 02:34:31.200]  set it up you want to run it well you
[02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:32.880]  want to make sure people
[02:34:32.880 --> 02:34:34.800]  stay civil and how do you keep things
[02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:36.320]  correct and keep people from doing
[02:34:36.320 --> 02:34:38.720]  you know stupid things but also just set
[02:34:38.720 --> 02:34:39.920]  it up so it's as secure
[02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:41.920]  and sensible as you want so i have this
[02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:43.200]  great url
[02:34:43.200 --> 02:34:45.040]  you can go to take control dot com of
[02:34:45.040 --> 02:34:46.880]  course to control books rather dot com
[02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:49.520]  of course but i have slack help dot me i
[02:34:49.520 --> 02:34:51.840]  got this url and i'm very happy about it
[02:34:51.840 --> 02:34:53.680]  slack help dot me i will absolutely put
[02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:55.040]  it in the show notes i love
[02:34:55.040 --> 02:34:56.560]  just by the way i know it's probably not
[02:34:56.560 --> 02:34:58.240]  probably you know maybe you did i don't
[02:34:58.240 --> 02:34:59.840]  know i know you know adam but i love the
[02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:01.760]  new uh cover design for the take control
[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:02.400]  books
[02:35:02.400 --> 02:35:04.080]  so it's so great took a lot of years to
[02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:06.240]  figure out what we didn't like
[02:35:06.240 --> 02:35:08.000]  to this illustrative approach and then
[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:09.680]  the minute i saw the new designs when
[02:35:09.680 --> 02:35:11.440]  they're in progress i'm like oh this is
[02:35:11.440 --> 02:35:13.200]  it it's like a discovering like you're
[02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:15.280]  cutting away yeah i block a marble and
[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:16.640]  there's the sculpture inside i think
[02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:17.280]  it's probably no
[02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:19.280]  no surprise that you know you can guess
[02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:20.720]  that i you know you know my taste in
[02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:21.760]  graphic design
[02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:23.440]  but well one of the things that i really
[02:35:23.440 --> 02:35:25.440]  love about the new cover design is that
[02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:27.920]  putting the where the author title is it
[02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:30.160]  the author title is in relatively small
[02:35:30.160 --> 02:35:33.280]  print but the topic is a big print which
[02:35:33.280 --> 02:35:34.480]  is right because that's what take
[02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:36.080]  control books are about
[02:35:36.080 --> 02:35:38.240]  very topical there it's like there this
[02:35:38.240 --> 02:35:40.240]  is about slack admin so that's nice and
[02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:40.960]  big
[02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:43.600]  real nice font all caps which i of
[02:35:43.600 --> 02:35:44.240]  course like
[02:35:44.240 --> 02:35:46.400]  then the author name is down below real
[02:35:46.400 --> 02:35:48.000]  small but because it's surrounded by
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:49.760]  white space it is
[02:35:49.760 --> 02:35:52.880]  so prominent and i love prominence
[02:35:52.880 --> 02:35:55.120]  in an author's name like it's because
[02:35:55.120 --> 02:35:56.240]  that's to me is the whole point of the
[02:35:56.240 --> 02:35:57.600]  take control series is that
[02:35:57.600 --> 02:35:59.200]  they're not just turned out these are
[02:35:59.200 --> 02:36:01.200]  like the best writers in our racket who
[02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:02.480]  do these things
[02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:04.400]  it's fun too i love writing ebooks after
[02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:06.000]  i mean i kind of misprint but
[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.800]  you know faster turnaround yeah um yeah
[02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:11.040]  so slack slack's fun it's it's fun i know
[02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:11.840]  people that
[02:36:11.840 --> 02:36:13.440]  jeff carlson knows long time mac where
[02:36:13.440 --> 02:36:15.440]  he and his wife have a two-person slide
[02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:17.280]  because it's free you can use it free
[02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:18.400]  you know with some limits but not you
[02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:20.880]  know 10 000 people we have a slack group
[02:36:20.880 --> 02:36:21.760]  we set up
[02:36:21.760 --> 02:36:23.360]  if people go to slackhelp.me there's a
[02:36:23.360 --> 02:36:25.280]  link it's a public slack
[02:36:25.280 --> 02:36:26.960]  team that anyone can join who just wants
[02:36:26.960 --> 02:36:29.120]  to understand what slack is like without
[02:36:29.120 --> 02:36:30.720]  having to set one up so it's for it's
[02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:31.920]  called slack bits
[02:36:31.920 --> 02:36:33.280]  and we're having discussions about mac
[02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:35.280]  stuff but also slack help and it's great
[02:36:35.280 --> 02:36:36.640]  we got several hundred people joined who
[02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:38.240]  just they wanted a place to go with no
[02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:39.040]  overhead
[02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:41.200]  and um because it takes five minutes to
[02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:42.480]  set up a slack team but you have to set
[02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:44.160]  one up and you're dealing with it so
[02:36:44.160 --> 02:36:46.800]  um i like there's a lot more so my very
[02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:48.800]  last point a lot more public slack teams
[02:36:48.800 --> 02:36:50.320]  starting like this one for mac admins
[02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:51.440]  there's a bunch of them i keep hearing
[02:36:51.440 --> 02:36:53.120]  about private ones that have
[02:36:53.120 --> 02:36:55.120]  hundreds or thousands of people if
[02:36:55.120 --> 02:36:56.480]  twitter isn't careful
[02:36:56.480 --> 02:36:57.760]  some of the conversation is going to get
[02:36:57.760 --> 02:36:59.280]  drained off to private slack groups
[02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:00.400]  where everything is controlled
[02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:02.560]  that's a very interesting tie-in and on
[02:37:02.560 --> 02:37:04.160]  the slack that i'm on that point has
[02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:05.680]  been made before too there's an awful
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:06.880]  lot of people i've heard this from other
[02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:09.040]  people but on the board i'm on with
[02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:10.160]  you know you probably know everybody's
[02:37:10.160 --> 02:37:12.160]  there it's a bunch of mutual friends um
[02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:13.840]  but it's relatively small group maybe
[02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:15.040]  like 15 of us
[02:37:15.040 --> 02:37:18.320]  um and and no a whole bunch of them
[02:37:18.320 --> 02:37:20.240]  i've admitted that they personally use
[02:37:20.240 --> 02:37:21.360]  twitter a lot less
[02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:23.680]  because of this this slack yeah same
[02:37:23.680 --> 02:37:25.360]  thing rather just communicate with this
[02:37:25.360 --> 02:37:27.600]  handful of good friends people who i
[02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:28.320]  would like to go
[02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:30.640]  and have dinner and a drink with then
[02:37:30.640 --> 02:37:32.160]  interact with the world at large on
[02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:33.440]  twitter just because of
[02:37:33.440 --> 02:37:34.960]  you know a couple of knuckleheads who
[02:37:34.960 --> 02:37:36.960]  who make it unpleasant it's safe you
[02:37:36.960 --> 02:37:38.240]  know you know everybody's part of the
[02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:40.640]  group and uh even if it's a public group
[02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:41.600]  there's still an administrator who can
[02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:42.640]  kick anybody off
[02:37:42.640 --> 02:37:44.320]  and uh incomparable podcast network we
[02:37:44.320 --> 02:37:45.520]  have an incomparable slack with i don't
[02:37:45.520 --> 02:37:47.200]  know 50 or 60 people who are involved in
[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:49.200]  the many many many podcasts
[02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:51.280]  jason stell has now uh got up at the
[02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:52.720]  site and um that's where
[02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:54.320]  a lot of my conversation that i don't
[02:37:54.320 --> 02:37:56.560]  trust to do publicly anymore because
[02:37:56.560 --> 02:37:58.400]  there's too many jerks on twitter who
[02:37:58.400 --> 02:37:59.760]  will respond to it i have those
[02:37:59.760 --> 02:38:01.120]  conversations with many of the same
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:02.480]  people who i would have on twitter i
[02:38:02.480 --> 02:38:03.600]  have not privately so
[02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:05.600]  sad but all right my thanks to you glenn

[02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:17.600]  stuff that you're going to be like i
[02:38:17.600 --> 02:38:18.800]  didn't know i could do that
