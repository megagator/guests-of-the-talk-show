[00:00.000 --> 00:06.160]  It's like if there's any appliance I don't want to turn into a social network or advertising
[00:06.160 --> 00:11.920]  platform it's communications like a phone like I don't want to know if somebody's
[00:11.920 --> 00:12.920]  having Thai food.
[00:12.920 --> 00:16.920]  This is not part of the show because talking about Skype is like it's like a college
[00:16.920 --> 00:22.040]  newspaper columnist writing about writing a college newspaper column.
[00:22.040 --> 00:25.420]  Dude you have to include this in the show because here's the problem.
[00:25.420 --> 00:30.360]  It's like everybody goes around with this Skype works fine until it doesn't.
[00:30.360 --> 00:31.440]  It's mostly fine.
[00:31.440 --> 00:32.440]  It's annoying.
[00:32.440 --> 00:35.180]  It's weird that it has ads in it.
[00:35.180 --> 00:38.080]  It's strange that I've got there's so much cruft.
[00:38.080 --> 00:43.040]  I want like five buttons to click to connect with the people that I talk to and I don't
[00:43.040 --> 00:44.040]  want anyone else to contact me.
[00:44.040 --> 00:45.040]  That's exactly what I want.
[00:45.040 --> 00:49.080]  I want like somebody to build me a front end for Skype.
[00:49.080 --> 00:50.080]  Right right.
[00:50.080 --> 00:51.840]  Well it's a web app you can probably just put it together yourself you're just doing
[00:51.840 --> 00:53.200]  markdown.
[00:53.200 --> 00:58.960]  I just laugh because it's the podcast is it's like I'm half writer at Daring Fireball
[00:58.960 --> 01:05.700]  half podcaster on the talk show and on half of my business the software just randomly
[01:05.700 --> 01:08.720]  changes under fire.
[01:08.720 --> 01:14.240]  Well I have to just I don't know you can leave this out but like so Skype Skype the protocol
[01:14.240 --> 01:21.720]  is something basically the as soon as RSS to serve audio began it became a thing.
[01:21.720 --> 01:24.340]  The question became well how do we record these with people who aren't in the room with
[01:24.340 --> 01:29.840]  us and in the earliest I remember this being an issue when I was on frickin Mac break weekly
[01:29.840 --> 01:36.400]  it's like everybody hates Skype but as of 2000 whatever five nobody had found anything
[01:36.400 --> 01:39.440]  better than Skype and the truth is people are out there actively trying.
[01:39.440 --> 01:40.680]  Yes I know there are websites.
[01:40.680 --> 01:44.680]  Yes I know there's all these other things but if you ever have to talk to somebody who's
[01:44.680 --> 01:48.720]  not a dear friend there's a pretty good chance you're going to have to use Skype for your
[01:48.720 --> 01:52.440]  job and this is my quote unquote job.
[01:52.440 --> 01:57.960]  The thing is though like it is you've nailed it it's like yeah I guess you could use FaceTime
[01:57.960 --> 02:02.640]  you could use stuff but like this could just go away and I don't know what I would do.
[02:02.640 --> 02:09.800]  Like the other half of my business I'm so utterly professional and conservative in my
[02:09.800 --> 02:10.800]  tools.
[02:10.800 --> 02:15.740]  Like you you're so into making you've got you got a movable type from 1977 you've got
[02:15.740 --> 02:19.320]  all you got your little fonts in there you know it's funny you know did you catch the
[02:19.320 --> 02:24.560]  end joke in episode five of season two of Stranger Things they're using movable type.
[02:24.560 --> 02:26.800]  Oh you're kidding.
[02:26.800 --> 02:28.360]  I am kidding.
[02:28.360 --> 02:29.480]  I'm not that far in.
[02:29.480 --> 02:33.680]  Well it takes place in 1984 so it would be tough.
[02:33.680 --> 02:37.200]  You know I like that program but I got issues with with the songs that they pick for things
[02:37.200 --> 02:42.360]  it's it's you know okay so I had this thing happen a couple weeks ago I've talked about
[02:42.360 --> 02:45.180]  this on all my shows I'm very sorry if you've heard them I'm just sorry in general if you've
[02:45.180 --> 02:49.360]  heard my shows but but I but I had a thing happen where like one day I'm recording with
[02:49.360 --> 02:54.240]  Roderick everything's fine the next day I try to Skype with Dan and check this one out
[02:54.240 --> 03:00.760]  okay so I can I can text with anybody in Skype multiple people in groups everything is fine
[03:00.760 --> 03:07.400]  I call them it doesn't ring on their end they call me it doesn't ring on my end I'm trying
[03:07.400 --> 03:13.000]  I am pissing on every spark plug I can find I'm in the console like an animal I'm trying
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.960]  to figure out what is wrong it just didn't work for two weeks and I just brought my laptop
[03:17.960 --> 03:24.680]  in my MacBook adorable which is not super fun but it works tried it again Monday work
[03:24.680 --> 03:31.700]  fine yay that doesn't give me a feeling of hope that like a mystery me problem appeared
[03:31.700 --> 03:34.800]  and then disappeared and I don't know why that that is the pain that's not how computers
[03:34.800 --> 03:40.680]  work I should be I don't know I forget we just had a problem could be a corrupted font
[03:40.680 --> 03:48.320]  I don't know it's always a corrupted seriously though does it give you the fear a little
[03:48.320 --> 03:51.880]  bit like you're you're a podcast big shot now like you you got to do this for stuff
[03:51.880 --> 03:55.440]  sometimes you get you know one to two episodes a month out if you're having a good month
[03:55.440 --> 04:01.040]  you push out the program it doesn't it kind of give you the fear it does you know I've
[04:01.040 --> 04:06.040]  looked you know it's funny it's like I do I I don't know if this comes as a surprise
[04:06.040 --> 04:14.840]  you but I'm not really I'm not really one to keep good records throughout the year and
[04:14.840 --> 04:20.960]  I think traditionally in the modern and in carnation of this show I've averaged somewhere
[04:20.960 --> 04:26.960]  around 40 episodes a year so ostensibly it's weekly it's never really been close it's been
[04:26.960 --> 04:34.500]  around 40 nominally 30 this is episode I think this is the 31st of 2017 I felt like
[04:34.500 --> 04:38.500]  things were see I don't know you're such a black box I don't know if you're at Disney
[04:38.500 --> 04:42.220]  I don't know what you're doing like I noticed I noticed that sometimes you as everybody
[04:42.220 --> 04:47.040]  knows you get a little careless with your references and I and I'll see some brackets
[04:47.040 --> 04:50.520]  that make it into the post and that's when everybody knows you're probably on a lounge
[04:50.520 --> 04:57.040]  chair having a beverage you wouldn't do that on your Mac no I might I might I might but
[04:57.040 --> 05:00.680]  it's it's more likely to happen when I'm doing it from the phone if it doesn't harm your
[05:00.680 --> 05:04.920]  OPSEC if you are you've probably talked about this before but like as of today like you're
[05:04.920 --> 05:08.320]  somewhere remote you go to Disney property with your family and you want to you want
[05:08.320 --> 05:11.760]  to post something about Gene Munster what do you do we draft that in how do you post
[05:11.760 --> 05:18.800]  that I'd usually just do it right in the movable type web app which I've sort of customized
[05:18.800 --> 05:24.920]  over the years on an iPhone Wow and if it's longer and it used to be a problem in the
[05:24.920 --> 05:32.400]  earlier years of the iPhone where back in the days when when RAM was tighter and remember
[05:32.400 --> 05:38.540]  you'd leave Safari and you'd come back to Safari and we just have to reload but yeah
[05:38.540 --> 05:43.560]  when it reloads when you've got a mostly edited post in a text area it makes you a little
[05:43.560 --> 05:50.080]  angry I rarely type that doesn't happen as you know the iPhone is just sort of just sort
[05:50.080 --> 05:53.640]  of reach the point where it never happens but if it's a little bit longer than that
[05:53.640 --> 05:59.200]  then I'll copy and paste everything and do it and Vesper or the notes app or something
[05:59.200 --> 06:06.080]  the most I type anything that I care about in the native app I realize that I'm a lunatic
[06:06.080 --> 06:09.720]  but like if I'm texting somebody like click with you and I message is like that's fine
[06:09.720 --> 06:13.840]  that's okay like that's gonna be fine but like almost everything I do if it's something
[06:13.840 --> 06:18.280]  I just need to capture really quickly it starts in drafts and then I have a little script
[06:18.280 --> 06:25.480]  in drafts that will take the first line and add a date stamp to it and put it in my my
[06:25.480 --> 06:29.360]  text files folder and then I'll open it up usually in editorial and that's where I do
[06:29.360 --> 06:33.720]  a lot of my jazz with markdown and stuff like that but and it's you know it's one reason
[06:33.720 --> 06:37.100]  that the Twitter character count thing isn't driving me completely crazy because I still
[06:37.100 --> 06:42.360]  write right I still draft most things in a legitimate app that's got an actual character
[06:42.360 --> 06:48.320]  count in it even your even your tweet yeah oh yeah oh yeah absolutely hundred percent
[06:48.320 --> 06:54.120]  you can't you can't get returns in the Twitter app or use Twitter if it right yeah okay yeah
[06:54.120 --> 06:58.520]  um yeah no I write it in drafts usually and then drafts is synced so it syncs with all
[06:58.520 --> 07:02.480]  the devices but anyways it's kind of boring but you ever imagine markdown would be this
[07:02.480 --> 07:09.280]  dirty no well it's a funny it's it's a it's funny because I was I really thought that
[07:09.280 --> 07:13.240]  I had something when it first came out I really thought I was like you know what this is it
[07:13.240 --> 07:21.800]  and and bless his heart Aaron Schwartz was super excited too and and and the history
[07:21.800 --> 07:26.240]  of that collaboration is sort of muddied because what I think I've talked about this before
[07:26.240 --> 07:31.880]  do you want to go back you want to go back to 2003 I absolutely would I mainly knew Aaron's
[07:31.880 --> 07:36.980]  contribution as the Python script that would go backwards was how I mainly remember him
[07:36.980 --> 07:42.440]  being involved but he was there from nearly day right he had you know what I'm talking
[07:42.440 --> 07:47.520]  about like he had the dot pie that you made markdown HTML and I feel like he had something
[07:47.520 --> 07:51.720]  that would do yeah it would take markdown and turn it or no take HTML and mark down
[07:51.720 --> 07:56.120]  a fight so you could copy and paste like new source on a web page and it would ignore just
[07:56.120 --> 08:03.020]  skip all the garbage tags and then just take tags like italics and the link yeah just the
[08:03.020 --> 08:10.560]  AH refs and turn them into real links how far back so there was Dean Allen's textile
[08:10.560 --> 08:17.740]  right which was a markdown sort of thing but not that close it was a little bit was that
[08:17.740 --> 08:21.960]  preceded by set text yeah that was there they were all there you know there were a whole
[08:21.960 --> 08:26.180]  bunch of these little formats but none of them really did the right thing none of them
[08:26.180 --> 08:31.040]  were really meant just specifically for turning it into HTML except textile was but I didn't
[08:31.040 --> 08:36.200]  like it because that still has seemed to have a lot of good gibberish up front do you ever
[08:36.200 --> 08:41.880]  write tear off the thing that you used to write man pages it's no I mean only only when
[08:41.880 --> 08:45.520]  I was playing like with trying to learn another book I never used it for anything the way
[08:45.520 --> 08:51.200]  that those things work is everything is preceded by some kind of code so there's like something
[08:51.200 --> 08:58.880]  at the beginning of every paragraph or line to tell you what this line is and it's tercer
[08:58.880 --> 09:03.200]  than writing raw HTML cuz that's the one thing is when you're just writing raw HTML it's
[09:03.200 --> 09:09.820]  just a lot of just a lot of the tags are just it's just character it's just character salad
[09:09.820 --> 09:15.080]  there's so much stuff like the most basic one is for writing legit HTML in the modern
[09:15.080 --> 09:19.380]  age you need an opening and closing paragraph tag right which I understand semantically
[09:19.380 --> 09:22.920]  why you need that but that's really crafty exactly trying to make right opening and closing
[09:22.920 --> 09:27.320]  is exactly it where you just you don't need it so textile got rid of a lot of that and
[09:27.320 --> 09:30.760]  if you were just writing in a plain text editor and you didn't have any kind of helper WYSIWYG
[09:30.760 --> 09:35.920]  type thing it would save you tons of characters and your stuff was more readable and a guy
[09:35.920 --> 09:41.440]  named Brad Choate I'm not sure I've known him for years and I don't know if he's chosen
[09:41.440 --> 09:46.720]  to show at but I think he's choked worked at six apart and and helped make a much better
[09:46.720 --> 09:51.940]  textile plug-in for movable type and he had some ideas for like improving it and he and
[09:51.940 --> 09:57.000]  Dean Allen you know Dean took those ideas and then I typed in because I knew Dean and
[09:57.000 --> 10:07.640]  I knew Brad and I wrote to them with my ideas and Dean wrote back and said these ideas are
[10:07.640 --> 10:12.080]  fantastic it's fantastic but it's sort of like a different thing you should just go
[10:12.080 --> 10:18.600]  make the thing and I thought you know what you're probably right and there were a whole
[10:18.600 --> 10:24.080]  bunch of other formats I can't even remember them all there's one called restructured text
[10:24.080 --> 10:30.920]  I think which well then there was also the abbreviated R lowercase E S T capital S T
[10:30.920 --> 10:36.480]  oh yeah and also the well it wasn't PHP BB but there was also a pretty at the time a
[10:36.480 --> 10:42.560]  fairly common markdown ask markup language for using forums yeah that was pretty widely
[10:42.560 --> 10:48.840]  adopted was very very it was in terrible it was really bad and Aaron had one called ATX
[10:48.840 --> 10:53.180]  that never got any pickup at all I don't know that anybody ever other than Aaron really
[10:53.180 --> 10:56.880]  used it but he had a web page describing it and there are some good ideas in there and
[10:56.880 --> 11:05.360]  I stole from I stole from everybody to make markdown and basic it you know and the idea
[11:05.360 --> 11:08.240]  was because I think the first year and a half of during fireball I was writing everything
[11:08.240 --> 11:13.620]  in raw HTML and then I started writing like not so much in raw HTML but then I had like
[11:13.620 --> 11:18.040]  scripts and BB edit that would put the P tags in you know what I mean so I didn't have to
[11:18.040 --> 11:21.600]  have the P tags while I was editing an article and then only at the very end I'd put them
[11:21.600 --> 11:25.600]  in but then when I went to make like a typo error you know fix a typo at some point you
[11:25.600 --> 11:30.360]  have to go and you know once you convert to HTML it stuck in HTML and I thought that stuck
[11:30.360 --> 11:33.800]  so I emailed a bunch of people when you and I mean for folks who aren't familiar with
[11:33.800 --> 11:37.080]  this that the sucky part is that I run into this with square pit Squarespace which is
[11:37.080 --> 11:41.640]  a great service and I love it but like if I've if I've done something to HTML I forget
[11:41.640 --> 11:46.400]  and I'll go in and I'll I'll select something and put two asterisks around it forgetting
[11:46.400 --> 11:51.640]  that that's not going to get processed because once it's inside of an HTML use your words
[11:51.640 --> 11:55.200]  but once it's inside an HTML container container won't be processed as mark so I emailed a
[11:55.200 --> 12:01.000]  bunch of people who I thought might be interested when once I had like a basic basic does half
[12:01.000 --> 12:05.440]  the things markdown actually does version working and and my basic description of where
[12:05.440 --> 12:09.880]  I thought going and I emailed a bunch of people and everybody was I don't know how many people
[12:09.880 --> 12:14.040]  maybe 10 people and everybody was very nice you know like that looks cool but I could
[12:14.040 --> 12:16.800]  tell that was like that looks cool but I'll just keep doing what I'm doing I don't I don't
[12:16.800 --> 12:23.600]  get it except Aaron Aaron got it immediately and he was like oh my god this is brilliant
[12:23.600 --> 12:28.160]  and so he was like just my he was my only active beta tester really and so like for
[12:28.160 --> 12:32.180]  like three four months I just kept adding to it and at that point I had it installed
[12:32.180 --> 12:40.360]  on my daring fireball movable type installation and and no you know was nobody knew it wasn't
[12:40.360 --> 12:44.800]  released as a public beta announced or anything but I'd keep adding things to it or changing
[12:44.800 --> 12:50.880]  things and and when I admit there were certain changes I would make that were like not backwards
[12:50.880 --> 12:56.920]  compatible and so like I did I actually did the research the other day I like looked up
[12:56.920 --> 13:03.760]  like the first markdown post in movable type the first one that you know was set to be
[13:03.760 --> 13:10.720]  marked down not right HTML and I think it was like October of 2003 and I don't think
[13:10.720 --> 13:15.560]  I announced the public beta till March and and it hasn't changed much since that March
[13:15.560 --> 13:20.400]  public beta announcement but pretty much every single during fireball entry I wrote from
[13:20.400 --> 13:25.760]  October to March when I every week I'd have to go back and change every every one of them
[13:25.760 --> 13:30.600]  to like up you know to make oh I see what I mean like I would make it I'd make a change
[13:30.600 --> 13:35.920]  to markdown in January and I'd have to go back to October and make sure that I you know
[13:35.920 --> 13:42.920]  whatever syntax I used wasn't in any of those posts in October November December early January
[13:42.920 --> 13:46.680]  but it really made markdown way better like it like I don't think if I think if I had
[13:46.680 --> 13:50.160]  released the version that I had when I first started using it it would have it would have
[13:50.160 --> 13:57.400]  nobody ever would heard of it well I anyway what happened was we've released it and yeah
[13:57.400 --> 14:01.040]  Aaron was super super excited about it and Aaron I guess is you know he was friends with
[14:01.040 --> 14:04.960]  everybody he knew everybody so he knew Cory Doctorow personally so he wrote to Boing Cory
[14:04.960 --> 14:12.320]  at Boing Boing and Aaron didn't take credit as a co-collab as a you know like a co-author
[14:12.320 --> 14:16.320]  of markdown but the way he wrote his email to Cory Doctorow I think left Cory with the
[14:16.320 --> 14:22.520]  impression that it was like a joint by Aaron Schwartz and John Gruber thing and that made
[14:22.520 --> 14:26.720]  its way into Wikipedia for years and years and years where it said that it was markdown
[14:26.720 --> 14:32.440]  was created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz blah blah blah which and then you know the
[14:32.440 --> 14:37.440]  all the unfortunate he was more of a conciliary yeah he was like the use I would call it and
[14:37.440 --> 14:42.120]  I don't know and you know and to my and we were friends forever you know afterwards I
[14:42.120 --> 14:46.440]  mean to my knowledge he never once deliberately took credit for it I think it all came from
[14:46.440 --> 14:51.200]  the initial Boing Boing announcement that said John Gruber and Aaron Schwartz have released
[14:51.200 --> 14:58.160]  markdown but then it's like once Aaron killed himself it's like you know what am I gonna
[14:58.160 --> 15:01.720]  do you know I know and I've been meaning for years how the kid that kid did that kid did
[15:01.720 --> 15:05.360]  so much I met him when he was like probably 15 I met him when he was like 16 it was terrifying
[15:05.360 --> 15:11.280]  right it was terrifying and it was he was he was so scary he was so intense and so smart
[15:11.280 --> 15:16.320]  it was really really intimidating he was like a woodland feature he I felt like a dog trying
[15:16.320 --> 15:24.280]  to talk about math with with its owner okay you know yeah I got basically two beats in
[15:24.280 --> 15:29.400]  life with you one and I don't understand the Yankees thing the other one is we are now
[15:29.400 --> 15:35.880]  in our 13th and a half year of contention about an issue that I posted to the markdown
[15:35.880 --> 15:46.240]  discussion oh really in March of 2004 so this would be March 15 2004 responding to
[15:46.240 --> 15:50.160]  the thread here this is your I so I had said markdown treats asterisks and underscores
[15:50.160 --> 15:54.800]  is indicators of emphasis text wrap with one asterisk or wraps an HTML I says probably
[15:54.800 --> 16:00.120]  the game for a syntax suggestion but I'm having a hard time getting used to basically I wanted
[16:00.120 --> 16:09.840]  you to go with asterisk one asterisk on either side is emphasis and an underscore on either
[16:09.840 --> 16:17.480]  side is italic and you wrote me a very you wanted emphasis you wanted to be bold yeah
[16:17.480 --> 16:22.640]  sorry yeah both face yeah yeah but and you wrote me this long and very thoughtful email
[16:22.640 --> 16:27.320]  about the history of all of this you talked about set text you talked about lowercase
[16:27.320 --> 16:34.600]  are instructed text it's so funny I can't believe that it's been 13 years that's one
[16:34.600 --> 16:38.120]  of the few things that I put in the markdown that I actually don't like I don't like using
[16:38.120 --> 16:42.760]  underscores for anything I wish it though I still get confused in different implement
[16:42.760 --> 16:47.120]  this is not your fault but I mean it's different in with implementation still treat it differently
[16:47.120 --> 16:52.040]  especially in like a lot of the web browser ish versions of it where it or it's like don't
[16:52.040 --> 16:55.760]  get me started on slack and they're stupid because when I write up I write up the show
[16:55.760 --> 17:00.720]  notes for reconcilable differences and I send it to Chairman Syracuse for his an ointment
[17:00.720 --> 17:05.080]  and it looks like such a mess in slack and he you know he knows what it's supposed to
[17:05.080 --> 17:08.960]  look like but it just drives me nuts now the slack moon man markdown syntax makes me so
[17:08.960 --> 17:13.840]  furiously angry I think slack does exactly what you want where slack uses asterisks for
[17:13.840 --> 17:20.500]  bold and single underscores for italic right now now you got my brain all screwed up with
[17:20.500 --> 17:24.760]  markdown the way it works in markdown and now all other places it seems really screwy
[17:24.760 --> 17:29.320]  to me what I was thinking about doing back in the day was using underscores to be the
[17:29.320 --> 17:35.480]  to be the rappers around links because links are oh my god oh my god that's like this is
[17:35.480 --> 17:39.560]  like man in the high castle I can't even imagine that oh my god what an alternate universe
[17:39.560 --> 17:44.840]  that would be I love the brackets and the parentheses yeah I think I kind of do too
[17:44.840 --> 17:51.560]  and if anything it was a good move in hindsight because that's so many people no longer underline
[17:51.560 --> 17:55.000]  their links you know what I mean like so many web pages don't have underlines for links
[17:55.000 --> 17:57.960]  anymore I don't oh I see what you're saying right so in other words at the beginning of
[17:57.960 --> 18:01.640]  the link you'd put an underscore at the end of the link you'd put another underscore and
[18:01.640 --> 18:07.640]  then you'd put your parentheses for the URL or the brackets to put a URL reference right
[18:07.640 --> 18:13.320]  right but then you'd have underlined text to to indicate which what's the thing anyway
[18:13.320 --> 18:16.140]  you're very polite you're very polite you said the downside would be that markdowns
[18:16.140 --> 18:19.400]  format would no longer be the same everywhere if there's just one consistent style markdown
[18:19.400 --> 18:23.040]  should work exactly the same everywhere true it's also the case that this would add an
[18:23.040 --> 18:28.040]  entire layer of complexity to the software and you close with sorry to disappoint comma
[18:28.040 --> 18:35.880]  dash jg sorry to disappoint I I am surprised I I so anyway in the early years of markdown
[18:35.880 --> 18:40.520]  I was disappointed because it didn't seem to go anywhere and I thought my god this is
[18:40.520 --> 18:46.120]  so great I'm having so much fun writing my web posts now that this I I loved it I I didn't
[18:46.120 --> 18:49.600]  want to turn back once I started using it it seemed crazy to type to type especially
[18:49.600 --> 18:54.020]  lists lists are the ones where and I'm somebody I'm a list maker and the idea of making a
[18:54.020 --> 18:58.780]  list with opening and closing tags in nested tags just seemed mental I know well and the
[18:58.780 --> 19:03.600]  other thing too is I really really hate the WYSIWYG list makers I don't even like the
[19:03.600 --> 19:07.720]  one in Apple Notes which is one of the best ever but I hate like when you're in a word
[19:07.720 --> 19:11.200]  processor and you type a bullet and a thing and it's like oh you're making a list and
[19:11.200 --> 19:17.000]  I'll put you in list mode but then it's like it how do you get out of this I yeah it's
[19:17.000 --> 19:20.620]  like you they put you in a room where you make lists and there's only there's no door
[19:20.620 --> 19:27.880]  to get out patreon is really I like the patreon service a lot but their their browser editor
[19:27.880 --> 19:32.520]  is like his mind boggling it's all like what you've just selected you get a little pop
[19:32.520 --> 19:38.280]  up where you click on something to do something right kind of like you would get in notes
[19:38.280 --> 19:41.740]  but you get a pop up and it's like is this a list is this and if you've got more than
[19:41.740 --> 19:45.600]  one screen full of text it won't come up so you have to go through and keep selecting
[19:45.600 --> 19:49.720]  and selecting and selecting to make a long list it's better than what we have the secret
[19:49.720 --> 19:53.120]  the secret to markdown and the thing that drove people nuts at the beginning and it
[19:53.120 --> 19:57.760]  seems like it's it's become popular enough now that nobody bitches about it anymore but
[19:57.760 --> 20:04.520]  the secret to it and the difference between everything that came before it is that it
[20:04.520 --> 20:10.280]  it trusts you the person typing the markdown to be to be to type sane markdown like you
[20:10.280 --> 20:14.160]  could put any there's all sorts of ways that you could write it there's no way that you
[20:14.160 --> 20:19.720]  can like parse it and say this is a valid markdown document or not you can't it's it
[20:19.720 --> 20:26.200]  just trust you to to be saying and don't do something stupid well it works a damn sight
[20:26.200 --> 20:30.020]  better than I mean I like again I also really like Google Docs but when I paste something
[20:30.020 --> 20:35.200]  into Google Docs it's it's just bananas and there's no they took away they used to have
[20:35.200 --> 20:39.000]  this ability to go in I know this is dumb and nobody but me wants this they used to
[20:39.000 --> 20:43.960]  have an edit it was edit as HTML was the selection and it would pop it up and you would be able
[20:43.960 --> 20:48.440]  to go in and whatever I imagine that the underlying platform stuff change where it's not exactly
[20:48.440 --> 20:53.560]  HTML anymore but it's certainly not like any front page type nonsense but like you can
[20:53.560 --> 20:58.500]  now you go in and you go like oh like turn off space after paragraph like do all this
[20:58.500 --> 21:03.320]  stuff like why are there all these bullets that are blank and then space under that and
[21:03.320 --> 21:06.880]  for some reason that just bugs me like I'm not that tightly wound about this stuff but
[21:06.880 --> 21:10.960]  I if I'm gonna do like a you know honestly like a sponsor read I want to be very neatly
[21:10.960 --> 21:15.200]  formatted I want to understand where the parts of it are and I don't want you just this salad
[21:15.200 --> 21:19.400]  of like bullets and letters all over the place it's you know what I've been thinking about
[21:19.400 --> 21:23.520]  doing for years and I think I'm at the point where I just need to find the time to bear
[21:23.520 --> 21:33.400]  down and do it but I want to go back to my old emails from 2003 2004 with Aaron and put
[21:33.400 --> 21:37.640]  them together somehow and publish them in some way as here's here's how you know here's
[21:37.640 --> 21:43.960]  how markdown came to be and I've like a not an oral history but an email email history
[21:43.960 --> 21:48.360]  of yeah right and the decisions that we made and stuff like that and see what I misremember
[21:48.360 --> 21:53.880]  and stuff like that and it's just a part of it is that I'm lazy and that that seems like
[21:53.880 --> 21:57.340]  a big enough project that it's always worth putting out but the other part is just the
[21:57.340 --> 22:04.740]  genuine it pains me in some way to think about going back and looking at email from somebody
[22:04.740 --> 22:09.560]  who's who's died so tragically yeah but anyway and I thought you know I don't know maybe
[22:09.560 --> 22:15.560]  I could put it in e-book or something like that and you know send the proceeds to you
[22:15.560 --> 22:19.480]  know one of Aaron's you know pet causes or something like that anyway I think would be
[22:19.480 --> 22:23.360]  interesting and one of the things I remember specifically was and and it's just like the
[22:23.360 --> 22:29.200]  under the ways to make italics and there's two ways to do it which in theory I'm against
[22:29.200 --> 22:32.680]  there should be you know in theory there should be one way to do it unambiguous way to do
[22:32.680 --> 22:38.040]  it yeah but the reason that it supports both was it just seemed like there were so many
[22:38.040 --> 22:43.720]  people who like on you know who used either plain text email or unused net or something
[22:43.720 --> 22:49.600]  like that who who thought that underscores were the equivalent of italics and just as
[22:49.600 --> 22:54.600]  many people thought that asterisks were the equivalent of italics right well it used to
[22:54.600 --> 23:00.820]  be at least for me I used to do a lot more of scooting back and forth like round tripping
[23:00.820 --> 23:05.120]  between markdown and HTML for mostly because I was probably because I was doing blog stuff
[23:05.120 --> 23:11.120]  more often you know wherever that was whether that was Drupal or WordPress or whatever but
[23:11.120 --> 23:17.840]  I don't have much occasion to go HTML to markdown in my day to day what I will sometimes do
[23:17.840 --> 23:23.020]  is I'll drag an HTML document into envy alt which will then do its best to take whatever
[23:23.020 --> 23:27.360]  the soup of any given HTML document is and turn it into markdown it's usually it's usually
[23:27.360 --> 23:32.640]  pretty good but I mean that's one it seems like the ambiguity becomes a factor if you're
[23:32.640 --> 23:39.680]  in a environment where you are taking HTML into turning HTML into markdown and you want
[23:39.680 --> 23:43.060]  to consistently always be the same thing maybe for some kind of reg reg ex reasons like you
[23:43.060 --> 23:46.320]  never want it to be this instead of that because it would confuse the machine the other the
[23:46.320 --> 23:50.880]  other one that I remember that there's there would you know I remember this one was Aaron's
[23:50.880 --> 23:59.140]  idea was that there's two ways to make headers that you could set text or so the C text style
[23:59.140 --> 24:04.800]  is you write a header see text I say you're probably right I if I think C text every everything
[24:04.800 --> 24:11.840]  I think is wrong pronunciation wise so let's go set text what is it it's you underline
[24:11.840 --> 24:17.600]  it with with I actually forget now I never use that style and I know I think one one
[24:17.600 --> 24:26.080]  set of equals is one and underline or dashes is h2 okay yeah sounds right I always do octave
[24:26.080 --> 24:32.920]  so there's the the big problem with that is that you only get to h2 the other problem
[24:32.920 --> 24:40.600]  is it's more typing and it was what's harder to format think Aaron had it in his ATX where
[24:40.600 --> 24:47.720]  it was just the octa Thorpe's it was just the hash tags in front and he was like you
[24:47.720 --> 24:52.280]  got to put this in I'm not typing all these you know I just want to type two octa Thorpe's
[24:52.280 --> 24:56.660]  in my header and hit return return and go and I was like all right all right but I also
[24:56.660 --> 25:01.640]  liked the brilliance of it like I'm sitting here as the author of markdown and I had a
[25:01.640 --> 25:06.080]  moment where I couldn't remember if equals was h1 or dash was h1 you know or vice versa
[25:06.080 --> 25:11.640]  whereas with the octa Thorpe's there's no doubt one of them is h1 2 is h2 3 is h3 up
[25:11.640 --> 25:17.000]  to 6 is h6 that's brilliant yeah it's absolutely brilliant and then the other thing I remember
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.400]  I seem to remember discussing this with Aaron is I was like is it weird that the one that
[25:21.400 --> 25:28.760]  seems like it has more emphasis meaning 6 octa Thorpe's for an 8 6 is actually the lesser
[25:28.760 --> 25:33.320]  and but then what we thought was that no because it's actually more like an outline right where
[25:33.320 --> 25:37.560]  the deeper you go it's almost like a level of it's like a level of indentation and it's
[25:37.560 --> 25:43.200]  it's gonna work and it's you know it's clearly the one that sticks I think there's a lot
[25:43.200 --> 25:46.320]  of people who use markdown on a daily basis who don't even know about the equals and dash
[25:46.320 --> 25:52.920]  thing oh I would bet I want to start a new document I live mostly in h2 and h3 h1 is
[25:52.920 --> 25:57.640]  this hallowed thing I kind of rarely use when you start a new document is h1 the title of
[25:57.640 --> 26:01.980]  the document I don't know is it a time I've never known what to do about that I always
[26:01.980 --> 26:07.240]  start with h2 like if I'm going to show notes in in a text document I always start with
[26:07.240 --> 26:13.000]  like I might have you know two octa Thorpe pound sign two pound signs titles and topics
[26:13.000 --> 26:18.160]  two pound signs follow-up two pound sign sponsor it's and then like listener feedback too and
[26:18.160 --> 26:23.040]  then for each and then it's like do three octa Thorpe's listener Jason question about
[26:23.040 --> 26:28.320]  resetting iPhone settings you know what I mean that's that makes the most sense in it
[26:28.320 --> 26:31.160]  and there's some that will actually like make an outline for you now right I mean aren't
[26:31.160 --> 26:37.480]  there some that'll give you like a left rail or if there's some I you know all I use is
[26:37.480 --> 26:41.960]  I use the most basic stuff it's so bad I should I should get sexier with this stuff but you
[26:41.960 --> 26:47.680]  know my trick that I have a daring fireball or if you add dot TEX dot TEX T to any of
[26:47.680 --> 26:54.040]  my articles permalinks you can get the raw markdown version so in that the the header
[26:54.040 --> 26:57.940]  part is actually part of a template that doesn't come out I don't type that when I type the
[26:57.940 --> 27:04.920]  article but I use I in that format I use the h1 tag for the or h1 format for the title
[27:04.920 --> 27:13.160]  oh look at that and you're you're using equals yeah how fun cuz that's h1 but I don't have
[27:13.160 --> 27:16.760]  to do that you know I mean like I don't do that manually that happens automatically and
[27:16.760 --> 27:22.940]  getting the exact right number of equals that's some kind of complicated reg X in my movable
[27:22.940 --> 27:28.400]  type template I'm intrigued by the way you do your what do you call it not the anchor
[27:28.400 --> 27:32.600]  but the way you title your links usually do like two characters they're like the author
[27:32.600 --> 27:37.840]  of the article okay all right yeah that's good and where do I put them that's you know
[27:37.840 --> 27:41.900]  sometimes I put here here's one where I put them all at the end I used to be really meticulous
[27:41.900 --> 27:45.300]  about always putting at the bottom sometimes on a longer article I like to put it right
[27:45.300 --> 27:50.920]  after the block quote oh yeah do you usually do that kind you don't do yeah you don't do
[27:50.920 --> 27:54.680]  much you know not really are you can see you know if you browse around on a daily basis
[27:54.680 --> 27:57.980]  you can see when I do in line and when I don't the short of the post the more likely I am
[27:57.980 --> 28:01.800]  to do in line of course well one thing that's nice I think this is an NBL feature but when
[28:01.800 --> 28:09.240]  I'm an NBL so if you've got a URL in the clipboard you can select some text and hit what option
[28:09.240 --> 28:14.500]  command V I think we try this isn't it funny how you you do it without thinking about it
[28:14.500 --> 28:19.440]  you have to talk about it yeah I know I know yeah option command V so if you select so
[28:19.440 --> 28:24.920]  if you've got a URL in the clipboard you select something hit option command V it turns the
[28:24.920 --> 28:29.760]  word you selected it puts the word you selected inside of brackets and then puts the URL in
[28:29.760 --> 28:34.480]  parentheses right after it it's a real huge time saver all right so let's just rewind
[28:34.480 --> 28:37.520]  here for a little bit all right sexy stuff you want start the show so you're you got
[28:37.520 --> 28:43.280]  envy all now are you sinking are you sinking that yes it's very funny I am apparently not
[28:43.280 --> 28:47.800]  the only person in this condition but I have a Dropbox folder called elements because there
[28:47.800 --> 28:52.360]  was a time when the text editor called elements came out when it this might have preceded
[28:52.360 --> 28:58.280]  the days of slash that was Justin Williams his app right and elements was a really good
[28:58.280 --> 29:04.440]  really really good this is like a 2008 2009 this is after after I lost my mind was simple
[29:04.440 --> 29:11.320]  note dropping some data one time and I was like that's it game over yeah crisis of confidence
[29:11.320 --> 29:16.720]  yeah Justin made that but it was hardwired to a top level Dropbox slash elements and
[29:16.720 --> 29:23.720]  to this day all of my text files 600 text files are still I know Alex Cox same way something
[29:23.720 --> 29:29.280]  called I'm gonna say that when an app that syncs data like a notes app loses data it
[29:29.280 --> 29:35.400]  is to me at least it is like you own a store and you've caught the kid at the cashier taking
[29:35.400 --> 29:41.080]  money out of the register it's like it's you're out you're done fine it is in a rage like
[29:41.080 --> 29:46.440]  I've got the kid by the back of the jacket and it's like you know and I'm you frog marching
[29:46.440 --> 29:55.200]  out of your general exactly and the horse you rode in on yeah but it still happens sometimes
[29:55.200 --> 30:00.160]  and I don't I lose things sometimes and well no but you know what a lot of the times though
[30:00.160 --> 30:06.360]  for me it's like you suspect the kid is taking money out of the register I can't prove it
[30:06.360 --> 30:12.400]  but I'm but like when you can prove it it's it's like it turns me into a red rage and
[30:12.400 --> 30:16.200]  I know you know and I don't want a bad mouth simple note because I believe and and there
[30:16.200 --> 30:21.400]  were pretty soft they were pretty solid like 99 and I think they are now the other there
[30:21.400 --> 30:26.640]  I think they're in good hands with the the WordPress people what's what's the parent
[30:26.640 --> 30:31.840]  company at WordPress automatic is is took over I don't know yeah I had no idea and now
[30:31.840 --> 30:36.720]  I just I have a Dropbox folder that I sync with a Dropbox folder syncs all my stuff in
[30:36.720 --> 30:41.520]  editorial and envy alt that's a envy alt points at that elements folder editorial is using
[30:41.520 --> 30:47.000]  that on iOS and then for drafts I just use I think I'm just using iCloud sync for drafts
[30:47.000 --> 30:50.520]  because I don't want them I don't want those little like one-liners to get mixed in with
[30:50.520 --> 30:56.540]  my actual file yeah what do you use what do you what do you use I still use Vesper but
[30:56.540 --> 31:03.020]  it no no longer sinks so Vesper I have a combination I've got Vesper on the phone and that is for
[31:03.020 --> 31:09.720]  certain you like one of those people who has their pet stuffed that's that's Lulu she's
[31:09.720 --> 31:17.000]  a good good girl I I'm I use Apple Notes extensively and ever since the I think it was a year ago
[31:17.000 --> 31:21.960]  the year ago I think revision is when they switched from their goofy eye map syncing
[31:21.960 --> 31:28.840]  to cloud kit and it whenever that was it was either a year ago or two years ago it their
[31:28.840 --> 31:34.040]  syncing became rock-solid and I love the shared thing like we have a shared note right here
[31:34.040 --> 31:39.680]  I do it every week with whoever's on the show their shared document thing is is dynamite
[31:39.680 --> 31:44.040]  it really is I love I love it so much it's so great for birthdays and Christmas and shopping
[31:44.040 --> 31:50.220]  I use Apple Notes and on my Mac that I've got so I've got an iPhone only notes app Vesper
[31:50.220 --> 31:57.060]  on my iPhone I've got Apple Notes which syncs everywhere but then on my Mac my Mac's I have
[31:57.060 --> 32:03.000]  best or not Vesper Yojimbo where I keep a lot of stuff oh of course Yojimbo sinks and
[32:03.000 --> 32:07.760]  it sinks extraordinarily well but it's all a Mac only app it only it only sinks from
[32:07.760 --> 32:14.440]  Mac to Mac and somehow in my head I know where everything is I know exactly which type of
[32:14.440 --> 32:19.160]  things I put in Vesper that I want on my phone everywhere I go I know exactly what type of
[32:19.160 --> 32:26.280]  things I put in Yojimbo and I know that everything else is in Apple Notes and every once in a
[32:26.280 --> 32:29.960]  while I have to search two of them to find something but for the most part I just have
[32:29.960 --> 32:35.320]  this inexplicable intuitive way of doing it so for example do you Siri do you Siri with
[32:35.320 --> 32:39.960]  Apple Notes very much no like how in what way to tell her to make a new note well I
[32:39.960 --> 32:45.040]  mean the thing that limits me and how much I use Apple Notes and candidly I think I way
[32:45.040 --> 32:49.120]  overthink this but you know me I'm trying to become the voice guy and I want to utilize
[32:49.120 --> 32:55.360]  that more so I tend to name things in Apple Notes obviously intuitively but the way I
[32:55.360 --> 33:00.120]  would name something in Envy alt is is pretty bananas like I have this really silly like
[33:00.120 --> 33:04.280]  for example here is the latest episode of back to work in Envy alt and then a text file
[33:04.280 --> 33:12.320]  is beat b2w show dash note X e 350 and the date dot MD like and that means that is if
[33:12.320 --> 33:15.480]  that is the format that I use for every single show notes thing I could find show notes for
[33:15.480 --> 33:21.080]  anything instantly like that but good luck trying to use Siri to add something in such
[33:21.080 --> 33:28.300]  a way so my Apple Notes are like a four-year-old has named them it's like TV to watch words
[33:28.300 --> 33:35.560]  I do not like books and so the idea is I want it to be all stuff that's intuitive that I
[33:35.560 --> 33:39.260]  could say to Siri that I'd be able to add things to a list even though I'm not using
[33:39.260 --> 33:44.600]  it very much like that and in theory I get it I get where Apple's going with Siri and
[33:44.600 --> 33:48.760]  I get how they have like a billion active users around the world and that these are
[33:48.760 --> 33:57.960]  normal people but it's like I miss the I miss the old ways of if you've got some kind of
[33:57.960 --> 34:03.440]  automation utility there's there's a way to make it so that if you have a weird header
[34:03.440 --> 34:07.480]  format like that or a first-line format like that you could just there's a way that you
[34:07.480 --> 34:12.300]  could go in and make it like you in theory there should be a way that you could teach
[34:12.300 --> 34:16.660]  Siri that when you tell her to make a note that that she could she could do something
[34:16.660 --> 34:19.940]  like that for you and I'm you got to get the incantation right I mean it's a little bit
[34:19.940 --> 34:23.740]  like timers and reminders are you creating are you creating a note are you adding to
[34:23.740 --> 34:26.840]  a note are you adding to a reminders list are you creating a mine there's all kinds
[34:26.840 --> 34:31.680]  of ways you have I find myself having to stop a little bit and remember to get the incantation
[34:31.680 --> 34:37.000]  right you know remind me to take out pasta in six minutes but it's sort of like if you
[34:37.000 --> 34:43.040]  like like the goal here would be to it would be like having a human assistant with you
[34:43.040 --> 34:48.160]  oh when I say this you know yeah so like if I had an assistant who is always at my side
[34:48.160 --> 34:57.040]  a real human being and you know smart bright person and and I could say hey make a note
[34:57.040 --> 35:03.680]  I want to talk to Merlin about markdown history and and if this assistant knows that I like
[35:03.680 --> 35:08.580]  to put every note with some kind of like a date string at the top they'll do that automatically
[35:08.580 --> 35:12.360]  because they know I want to do it you know I mean like because I've told them that I'm
[35:12.360 --> 35:17.120]  like hey every time I tell you to make a note but make the first line like this and always
[35:17.120 --> 35:20.480]  always put the date in but put it last like I don't need to see that but like I need to
[35:20.480 --> 35:23.360]  know when it was right because I want to scan it when I scan the list of them I want to
[35:23.360 --> 35:29.480]  see that the words that I'm using yeah the first word should be something very important
[35:29.480 --> 35:33.880]  I get what you're saying so now don't don't make me have to learn how the assistant things
[35:33.880 --> 35:42.760]  you ever use a keyboard maestro you know I played with it I've got it and I played with
[35:42.760 --> 35:48.640]  it in another era if this were 10 years ago I would be spending half my day on that app
[35:48.640 --> 35:52.800]  because it does look very powerful and you can do stuff like can't you like do screens
[35:52.800 --> 35:57.360]  like like not screens like but you can control remotely using keyboard keyboard maestro like
[35:57.360 --> 36:02.060]  it sounds like it does like pretty much everything the remote stuff there's something like that
[36:02.060 --> 36:05.300]  but I think that he kind of got away from that there's but it's a way to it's a way
[36:05.300 --> 36:08.640]  to patch all kinds of stuff you don't currently like about how stuff works you can make it
[36:08.640 --> 36:13.360]  do a thing for you fairly right and I I've had it for years and then I kind of like didn't
[36:13.360 --> 36:17.240]  use it for a while or didn't do anything new with it for a while I had like a couple of
[36:17.240 --> 36:20.880]  things that you know there's would you say it's a little bit like workflow on iOS yeah
[36:20.880 --> 36:24.920]  it's the same basic idea but way more powerful because it's on the Mac and the Mac just has
[36:24.920 --> 36:31.000]  way more stuff you can do so for example actually let me do sponsor break and I'll come back
[36:31.000 --> 36:36.760]  this weekend then when I know where we were look I'm gonna take these sponsor breaks everybody
[36:36.760 --> 36:40.560]  you got it pay attention by the end of the show everybody you're gonna have your holiday
[36:40.560 --> 36:45.360]  shopping you're gonna be half done that's a nice service people need that that's hard
[36:45.360 --> 36:49.720]  holidays are tough on people my first the first sponsor of the show is a great company
[36:49.720 --> 36:55.140]  love their products that their company called away away makes bags and accessories and they
[36:55.140 --> 36:59.800]  are terrific gifts and they have a lifetime guarantee and a hundred day trial so there's
[36:59.800 --> 37:04.660]  a size and a color for everyone on your list this holiday season or you can grab an away
[37:04.660 --> 37:08.400]  gift card if you can't make up your mind or you don't know what color the person you want
[37:08.400 --> 37:12.880]  to buy this thing might want they use high quality materials and they offer a much lower
[37:12.880 --> 37:17.560]  price compared to other brands with similar quality by cutting out the middleman and selling
[37:17.560 --> 37:23.200]  direct to you without the retail markup they've got over ten colors and five sizes they got
[37:23.200 --> 37:29.000]  the carry-on that's actually what I have the bigger carry-on which I'm tempted to buy the
[37:29.000 --> 37:35.040]  medium the large and they also have the kids carry-on for the smaller travelers among us
[37:35.040 --> 37:39.520]  all of their suitcases are made with a premium German polycarbonate that's very lightweight
[37:39.520 --> 37:44.000]  and bends never breaks now listen to me if you're a longtime listener of the show you
[37:44.000 --> 37:47.960]  probably remember me talking about a way before I forget when they first sponsored the show
[37:47.960 --> 37:53.320]  but it was well over a year ago and before they sponsored it they sent me this they sent
[37:53.320 --> 37:58.720]  me the suitcase the carry-on nice black carry-on so I've taken that suitcase everywhere I've
[37:58.720 --> 38:04.640]  gone and for over a year maybe well over a year I don't know the thing looks brand new
[38:04.640 --> 38:08.720]  and I you know I mean it's how is that even possible you know I mean you put your overhead
[38:08.720 --> 38:13.040]  up in the thing and it ends up two rows behind you because they get jostled around and everything
[38:13.040 --> 38:18.840]  like that the wheels still roll great I mean like silent and like it like at the Philly
[38:18.840 --> 38:22.020]  Airport we've got some terminals where there's a downward slope you've got actually got to
[38:22.020 --> 38:27.080]  be careful because the damn thing would will run away from you and it goes so fast the
[38:27.080 --> 38:31.800]  interior features a patent-pending compression system helpful for over packers it's really
[38:31.800 --> 38:34.920]  great they've it's just the it's not complex it's not like what do I do with all these
[38:34.920 --> 38:39.360]  pieces in here it's pretty obvious I put my shirts down on the right side then there's
[38:39.360 --> 38:43.520]  a thing that you can put over the shirts after you fold them up a little bit and snap it
[38:43.520 --> 38:46.840]  into place and it keeps your shirts from getting all messed up by everything else that you
[38:46.840 --> 38:51.720]  pack in there they have got that whole like whole half of it is like a zippered area where
[38:51.720 --> 38:56.240]  you can just put loose stuff and yes yes the zip the left panel is a zippered area where
[38:56.240 --> 39:00.600]  you can put all that stuff that that that might rattle around and it never rattles around
[39:00.600 --> 39:05.120]  and then they have a removable washable laundry bag that keeps dirty clothes separate from
[39:05.120 --> 39:10.960]  clean I love that thing it sounds so simple it sounds like well I could just put any bag
[39:10.960 --> 39:14.760]  in my in my case the only thing that could I mean I don't want to say it's your sponsor
[39:14.760 --> 39:17.800]  but the only thing that would make it better if there was some way to charge my I wish
[39:17.800 --> 39:22.760]  they would address that let me tell you the carry-ons in fact what have a built-in battery
[39:22.760 --> 39:28.680]  pack it's like I don't know gazillion mega amps and it works it works it's got two it's
[39:28.680 --> 39:33.240]  not a trick it actually charges your phone like four or five times right at least at
[39:33.240 --> 39:37.760]  least five times and it's got two USB ports so you can sit there at the you know and this
[39:37.760 --> 39:43.080]  is great because you're sitting there at the airport and there is like one electrical terminal
[39:43.080 --> 39:47.760]  at like you're at gate 28 you know a you know a 28 you're waiting for your flight sand people
[39:47.760 --> 39:54.120]  are around there's one electrical terminal it's not near any seat or if it is near a
[39:54.120 --> 39:58.400]  seat there's a guy there who's smugly has two things plugged into it and it's like I've
[39:58.400 --> 40:03.640]  been here for three eight that I hate that guy or if it's over by the wall there's like
[40:03.640 --> 40:08.520]  nomads you're sitting by a garbage can refuse processed off-site you're sitting there plugged
[40:08.520 --> 40:12.760]  in by a garbage can that's no way to call it now it's sitting crisscross crisscross
[40:12.760 --> 40:20.480]  crisscross applesauce style grown adults sitting on the floor of the airport my phone no with
[40:20.480 --> 40:24.080]  a way you don't have to go fishing around to find your little portable battery pack
[40:24.080 --> 40:29.120]  you just flip open a thing on the top of your carry-on plug in your charging cable and you
[40:29.120 --> 40:34.800]  can sit there and charge any device it is fantastic and it's a brilliant idea and here's
[40:34.800 --> 40:38.160]  the thing I've mentioned this before and people say well then doesn't that just mean you have
[40:38.160 --> 40:42.400]  to charge your suitcase all the time and eventually you do yes but because the battery pack in
[40:42.400 --> 40:47.920]  the suitcase is like a five five times the one charge of an iPhone you only have to do
[40:47.920 --> 40:51.600]  that like once in a while like maybe at the end of a trip when you empty your suitcase
[40:51.600 --> 40:56.800]  just go plug it in and then it'll be ready to go for your next trip you know I only charge
[40:56.800 --> 41:01.620]  it every several trips and it always charges my phone I just you just only have to worry
[41:01.620 --> 41:05.560]  about it once in a while and they have a lifetime guarantee if anything breaks they will fix
[41:05.560 --> 41:09.800]  or replace it I'll give you a sad testimonial I see I love the away but I'm not allowed
[41:09.800 --> 41:13.520]  to use it anymore because my wife has totally adopted it it is now her bag she likes it
[41:13.520 --> 41:17.080]  so much she said this will be mine now and I said very well you take that bag and that's
[41:17.080 --> 41:20.040]  hers now and so when she has to do her business trip she has to like head out to Washington
[41:20.040 --> 41:23.440]  for one night the poor thing she just jams everything in that bag and takes off and she
[41:23.440 --> 41:27.320]  loves it it looks right it looks brand new it's completely crazy it's I know it's this
[41:27.320 --> 41:32.040]  is a very very good it really is excellent product and you know maybe you don't want
[41:32.040 --> 41:36.280]  to buy somebody else a suitcase for the holidays I don't know I think it's not a terrible gift
[41:36.280 --> 41:39.960]  but it's the sort of thing I would like and and I'm often in the case where there are
[41:39.960 --> 41:43.160]  relatives my parents or something like that and they say what do you want for Christmas
[41:43.160 --> 41:48.180]  John it's like oh my god this is a great answer to that question somebody comes to you dear
[41:48.180 --> 41:51.760]  listener and they say what do you want for Christmas and if you think it's in the budget
[41:51.760 --> 41:55.640]  you could say you know what get me one of these I need a new suitcase and I'll tell
[41:55.640 --> 41:58.880]  you what and it's exactly like I always say with the the Casper folks with the mattress
[41:58.880 --> 42:04.200]  life is too short to sleep on it on a ratty mattress life is too short I spent years before
[42:04.200 --> 42:09.680]  I got this thing with like a 15-20 year old carry-on that had a like you got the one around
[42:09.680 --> 42:14.280]  like a freaking grocery cart the other one had like hair in it it's so hard to get hair
[42:14.280 --> 42:17.400]  out of a wheel I deal with this with my daughter's backpack I'm in there with the tweezers an
[42:17.400 --> 42:21.040]  exacto light knife like some kind of an animal don't live like that get it away back yeah
[42:21.040 --> 42:25.240]  it's it's too short so anyway you know you owe it to yourself it's you know what it is
[42:25.240 --> 42:28.680]  John when you get married they say to you look you got to register and you say you know
[42:28.680 --> 42:31.400]  what I don't want to register I don't want to ask people for presents I feel like some
[42:31.400 --> 42:35.920]  kind of a monster they say no you don't understand auntie Susie she wants to register she wants
[42:35.920 --> 42:39.080]  to get you what you want why don't you do your family a favor and tell them all you

[43:02.040 --> 43:06.800]  thanks to away it's a great product go go get one all right I was talking about keyboard
[43:06.800 --> 43:13.040]  maestro keyboard maestro this great long-standing Mac utility now developed by stairway software
[43:13.040 --> 43:21.680]  which is Peter Peter Lewis's company down in Peter and Lewis is that the Australian
[43:21.680 --> 43:27.440]  guy yeah oh he did um oh god what did he do he did you have to do Interarkey yeah which
[43:27.440 --> 43:31.360]  is still around which is still around but he has since sold that to a different company
[43:31.360 --> 43:36.800]  did I say that right but he had like an FTP app back in the day right is correct wow I
[43:36.800 --> 43:40.800]  would say keyboard maestro if you've never I really recommend anybody who wants to nerd
[43:40.800 --> 43:46.920]  out on their Mac try it but it's sort of like a cross between automator and Apple script
[43:46.920 --> 43:52.720]  and quick keys yeah like the quick keys from back in the day but you can make these macros
[43:52.720 --> 43:56.320]  and can do amazing things but the thing that you can do is you can like make your own features
[43:56.320 --> 44:01.760]  in an application and here's the one and I think I'm often loathe to make these requests
[44:01.760 --> 44:07.740]  so for example I don't know why but in Twitter I've got three main accounts in descending
[44:07.740 --> 44:15.080]  order I've got my at Gruber at daring fireball and at the talk show and for whatever reason
[44:15.080 --> 44:20.280]  years ago I decided that I anytime I reply to like an ad during fireball tweet I'm going
[44:20.280 --> 44:27.000]  to do it from at Gruber that at me John Gruber is at Gruber and when somebody writes at during
[44:27.000 --> 44:35.440]  fireball in my mind somehow they're writing at the publication I don't know if that makes
[44:35.440 --> 44:39.860]  sense I think everybody could guess that if ad during fireball replied to you who's writing
[44:39.860 --> 44:46.080]  it yeah but it just doesn't seem right to me because like if you added the verge and
[44:46.080 --> 44:51.000]  the verge wrote back to you you wouldn't know who's writing and I don't plan on adding collaborators
[44:51.000 --> 44:55.060]  but anyway people may ask a question to the publication but they're receiving a response
[44:55.060 --> 44:59.360]  from the publisher anyway in tweet bot that meant that for years and years I would go
[44:59.360 --> 45:04.000]  through the ad during fireball replies and I get tons of great stuff there I love Twitter
[45:04.000 --> 45:10.120]  for feedback on my work so much better than email because it forces the brevity is it
[45:10.120 --> 45:14.840]  I'm way I don't read all my email I do read every single at reply to at Gruber at during
[45:14.840 --> 45:21.140]  fireball at the talk show and I don't it doesn't feel like a chore to be at the Twitter equivalent
[45:21.140 --> 45:26.680]  of inbox zero every day with those things so anybody out there who's ever attempted
[45:26.680 --> 45:30.280]  to write to me I'm way more likely to see it if you're if if what you're willing to
[45:30.280 --> 45:34.840]  say you're willing to do in public is a Twitter reply and I'm way more likely to write back
[45:34.840 --> 45:39.320]  but I constantly clicking on in tweet bot you reply from ad during fireball and then
[45:39.320 --> 45:43.280]  you have to click on your avatar and then select the other account like you click on
[45:43.280 --> 45:46.400]  the avatar and you get a little pop-up menu and for years I've been doing it and I've
[45:46.400 --> 45:51.760]  been thinking I would maybe I should write to tap bots and ask them for a feature that
[45:51.760 --> 45:55.960]  when I reply from this account reply from this other account and the thing that never
[45:55.960 --> 46:00.680]  made me every time I think to write that request I think this is asking for a feature that
[46:00.680 --> 46:05.680]  there's one person who's going to use and that's me right and that just feels you know
[46:05.680 --> 46:10.440]  I wouldn't do that ordinarily but as John Gruber the person who writes this influential
[46:10.440 --> 46:14.800]  site that you know is nice when you get links from they might be more tempted to do it and
[46:14.800 --> 46:18.360]  I that makes me feel awful and I think I can't write this email this is terrible oh yeah
[46:18.360 --> 46:23.460]  and then I realized like a month ago I realized you know what I could freaking do that with
[46:23.460 --> 46:35.000]  keyboard maestro and so I made like a macro that I type command R and it in and the the
[46:35.000 --> 46:39.540]  macro is only available in tweet bot right so keep keyboard maestro will let you make
[46:39.540 --> 46:46.760]  like an app specific shortcut I type command R which was the tweet bot shortcut for replying
[46:46.760 --> 46:52.600]  tweet our keyboard maestro sees it first and keyboard maestro the first thing it does is
[46:52.600 --> 46:57.520]  it itself types the command R keystroke and I thought when I was making this I was like
[46:57.520 --> 47:01.360]  well this is going to put me in an infinite loop right because it's going to like keyboard
[47:01.360 --> 47:04.640]  maestro is going to eat the command R again and it's going to have to like force quit
[47:04.640 --> 47:09.280]  something but no it just works keyboard maestro is so smart that it can eat the command R
[47:09.280 --> 47:16.240]  that I typed then type a virtual command R that tweet bot sees it opens the reply window
[47:16.240 --> 47:23.560]  it fakes a click on the the avatar and then hit like so it's not using a menu selection
[47:23.560 --> 47:27.320]  and using like a location on the screen yeah well it just that's old school that is really
[47:27.320 --> 47:34.240]  old it clicks at 34 comma 180 from the top left corner of the front window but I didn't
[47:34.240 --> 47:39.720]  have to type that I did that now I did that by recording in keyboard maestro you just
[47:39.720 --> 47:45.520]  hit record click in the middle of the avatar move down it's inside the app window so I
[47:45.520 --> 47:49.680]  get it okay so it's not confused about the whole overall screen it's just the ads and
[47:49.680 --> 47:55.680]  it defaults to that when you record it defaults to doing it within the window and then it
[47:55.680 --> 48:01.680]  types the down arrow keystroke which would move the selection to the which I happen to
[48:01.680 --> 48:05.240]  know I just happen to know that the ad Gruber account is at the top like if I wanted to
[48:05.240 --> 48:08.940]  switch to the second one it would have to type like down arrow twice and then types
[48:08.940 --> 48:13.120]  the return keystroke to select the item then the second thought I had is well this is going
[48:13.120 --> 48:17.680]  to be so slow it's going to like annoy me but it happens so instantaneously fast that
[48:17.680 --> 48:21.600]  you don't even see it yeah I ten years ago that would have been slow right now exactly
[48:21.600 --> 48:27.380]  I think process so quick so I type command R I tap on a tweet in tweet bot I type command
[48:27.380 --> 48:31.240]  R and it doesn't matter which account I'm in it's already it the reply is coming from
[48:31.240 --> 48:35.080]  ad Gruber which is the feature I wanted and I never had to bother the tap on people to
[48:35.080 --> 48:39.960]  do it and it's every bit as good as if tap as if tweet bot did it itself like there's
[48:39.960 --> 48:44.440]  no delay there's no wait it doesn't work like 90% of the time it works a hundred percent
[48:44.440 --> 48:49.360]  of the time that's a good solution that's good use for them so anyway I don't know how
[48:49.360 --> 48:53.080]  we got started on somehow talking about I think I mean I don't I don't do nearly as
[48:53.080 --> 48:56.240]  many of those as I used to but sounds like you've got it sounds like you have a lot of
[48:56.240 --> 49:03.080]  those things in draft so I'm like with drafts or really yeah yeah so drafts has all kinds
[49:03.080 --> 49:08.640]  of like little scripts you can add in to do stuff and I mean you can I first of all say
[49:08.640 --> 49:14.520]  I love drafts like it's it's just that for me drafts is it's so fast and it's so easy
[49:14.520 --> 49:18.720]  and what undistracting I mean it's really just there to say what do you need to type
[49:18.720 --> 49:23.440]  Merlin and I type it and then it does something with it and so for me I mean there's so much
[49:23.440 --> 49:28.640]  you can do with drafts that I'm not doing it's just that for me it's I mean to be totally
[49:28.640 --> 49:32.720]  candid if editorial had a way to create a blank document I guess you could use templates
[49:32.720 --> 49:36.660]  in there I don't know I just like the cleanliness of drafts you know the thing is that this
[49:36.660 --> 49:42.800]  is a very kind of 43 folders type of thing or even though like I'm not generating a lot
[49:42.800 --> 49:45.980]  of those things I mean there's a reason I'm still using textmate one with all of my old
[49:45.980 --> 49:49.680]  commands in there because I know how that stuff works and that's I know that's ludicrous
[49:49.680 --> 49:53.200]  I should be using sublime text or something but I just haven't changed it over it works
[49:53.200 --> 49:56.720]  fine I've got macros in there that I'm still using for different things but no I mean I
[49:56.720 --> 50:02.480]  think the key part of this is to you know if there's any anti pattern in the productivity
[50:02.480 --> 50:07.660]  world it's like going out and trying to find 50 answers to a problem that isn't a problem
[50:07.660 --> 50:12.000]  like trying to find answers to a question that doesn't exist but the corollary being
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.640]  well how do you develop a presence of mind to go like okay this is kind of an annoying
[50:16.640 --> 50:20.960]  thing I'd like to fix I don't want to bug the developer about it like how could I you
[50:20.960 --> 50:24.600]  know there's just a million things where you just develop a little more mindfulness about
[50:24.600 --> 50:28.640]  noticing something that could be fixed and then adopting the tools that lets you do that
[50:28.640 --> 50:33.200]  in an elegant way and I think that's that's a really smart way to proceed whatever platform
[50:33.200 --> 50:37.880]  you're using whatever year it is I think it's so interesting now that you know we're 10
[50:37.880 --> 50:41.640]  years into the iPhone and it's just sort of part of the air that we breathe on a daily
[50:41.640 --> 50:51.720]  basis how we have evolved these ways to just basically have the same shit on whatever device
[50:51.720 --> 50:57.040]  we're using you know what I mean and and because it was a huge problem in the early years right
[50:57.040 --> 51:00.720]  we had these amazing everybody was blown away by the iPhone and it was fantastic and it
[51:00.720 --> 51:05.800]  was like this is you know I'm in Star Trek here I've got this amazing thing and you'd
[51:05.800 --> 51:12.000]  have remember you'd like hook up your iPhone to your Mac and then you'd go through iTunes
[51:12.000 --> 51:19.840]  and it would update your contacts between new podcasts yeah no no totally well you know
[51:19.840 --> 51:24.340]  something in this evolution of mine to try and not stay current to be a cool kid but
[51:24.340 --> 51:28.240]  just to like not become all calcified is you know when I look at stuff like what you can
[51:28.240 --> 51:33.940]  do with an iPad Pro now and I think it's it gets kind of misframed as okay there's people
[51:33.940 --> 51:37.520]  over here who say they'll only ever use a desktop forever and then there's the phrases
[51:37.520 --> 51:42.540]  and three because of the world over here that are like are died in the wall iPad will never
[51:42.540 --> 51:46.640]  use anything else and there's a giant continuum in between and I think to figure out what
[51:46.640 --> 51:50.920]  the right device for you is you have to be you have to have some humility about asking
[51:50.920 --> 51:56.200]  yourself what you actually really need on this device and I have I mean if I'm honest
[51:56.200 --> 52:00.080]  like there's so much stuff where I go man I could never do that on the iPad well you
[52:00.080 --> 52:03.760]  know what the iPads got a lot of firepower now it's not a processing problem anymore
[52:03.760 --> 52:09.200]  it's more a case now of saying like well do I expect something like Keyboard Maestro on
[52:09.200 --> 52:13.240]  the iPad well geez I could never give up because I don't have I don't have Hazel on my iPad
[52:13.240 --> 52:19.040]  or whatever and the truth is like you know there are cases where that is absolutely true
[52:19.040 --> 52:24.140]  and you always like I'll always want to do all kinds of things on my Mac over iOS device
[52:24.140 --> 52:28.000]  but if you're really honest with yourself and you kind of trace back in the stack and
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.680]  say like well what is the actual problem that I'm trying to solve here what's the actual
[52:30.680 --> 52:34.920]  kind of work that I'm ultimately trying to produce let's take away the tools for a minute
[52:34.920 --> 52:39.080]  and say like this is where my job starts this is where my job is mostly done what needs
[52:39.080 --> 52:43.520]  to happen in between and for myself I found that if I ask that question with humility
[52:43.520 --> 52:49.180]  and honesty there's not that much stuff that I can't do in some way on the iPad what's
[52:49.180 --> 52:54.880]  the thing that Snell uses there's that thing where you turn it on oh what is that I keep
[52:54.880 --> 52:58.040]  every time he mentions it and I hear it on a podcast I'm like oh I gotta get that got
[52:58.040 --> 53:05.400]  to use that I've got to use that yeah basically it's just when you flip it the idea is that
[53:05.400 --> 53:09.560]  if when you're on your the initial use of that is when you're on your laptop you don't
[53:09.560 --> 53:14.000]  want to burn through all your bandwidth on this and that thing but it's perfect for Skype
[53:14.000 --> 53:22.040]  recording where I would just say Plex, Backblaze, Time Machine, like Dropbox like pause all
[53:22.040 --> 53:26.260]  of those things don't let those things touch the internet while I'm doing this show I apologize
[53:26.260 --> 53:30.800]  I try to ride that stuff it's not an easy way to quit there used to be a man an app
[53:30.800 --> 53:34.720]  you could get for Time Machine was like Time Machine manager what do you back up to you
[53:34.720 --> 53:42.400]  back up to a Time Machine airport base station type thing I used to because if you're not
[53:42.400 --> 53:45.680]  backing up to a hard drive that's connected that's not gonna that's not gonna affect the
[53:45.680 --> 53:49.960]  network yeah you know you're probably you're probably right but then I checked in that
[53:49.960 --> 53:55.880]  was also Backblaze going and now it is stopped but sorry I'm so sorry about that so basically
[53:55.880 --> 54:01.440]  I just got on a rant to say that my side should be clean I basically all I was saying was
[54:01.440 --> 54:07.360]  that if I'm honest with myself and think focus on the work that I'm trying to create there's
[54:07.360 --> 54:11.720]  not that many cases where it's just undoable on any given device I just have to think about
[54:11.720 --> 54:16.200]  what it is I'm actually doing instead of the tools that I'm accustomed to yeah so speaking
[54:16.200 --> 54:20.760]  of these devices you're there's a thing here in the show note your your daughter got a
[54:20.760 --> 54:26.860]  Chromebook this is so this breaks my heart so these Chromebooks at school it's what they
[54:26.860 --> 54:31.640]  do a lot of their stuff on so there's actually two funny stories here funny story number
[54:31.640 --> 54:41.360]  one is I am ready to throw my MacBook adorable into the sea because the I've been something
[54:41.360 --> 54:44.760]  like eight months almost a year in with this thing and I still can't get used to the arrow
[54:44.760 --> 54:50.880]  keys up and down I hate it so much hate the arrow keys I don't have one I don't but I
[54:50.880 --> 54:55.360]  hate it's what's the same on a MacBook Pro now dude I know when I tested the MacBook
[54:55.360 --> 55:00.880]  Pro last year and I realized you know that the ports are an issue and the USBC thing
[55:00.880 --> 55:06.140]  is a huge issue you know and and I do feel like a lot of the power users they have legitimate
[55:06.140 --> 55:11.800]  gripes about Apple's decision-making on this thing but I really do feel that an awful lot
[55:11.800 --> 55:17.680]  of it boils down to Apple bet big on USBC and the industry did not move to USBC like
[55:17.680 --> 55:22.880]  you go and look for USBC peripherals and it's like crickets chirping it's like Marco has
[55:22.880 --> 55:28.200]  laid this out very well if you even even if you buy in on dongle town there's still not
[55:28.200 --> 55:31.400]  any way to do what you would want to do let's say you want to record it like he does you
[55:31.400 --> 55:36.440]  want to record a live podcast with a top-of-the-line MacBook Pro there's really no way to do that
[55:36.440 --> 55:40.080]  and get power at this point right and you know what I mean you don't want to record
[55:40.080 --> 55:45.680]  a show without power that'd be nice their show runs kind of long I know you're right
[55:45.680 --> 55:49.140]  that was not a MacGuffin exact I know yeah that was certainly the thing everybody noticed
[55:49.140 --> 55:55.080]  but like I the in what do you call it the inverted T yeah pattern of arrows I had no
[55:55.080 --> 55:59.700]  I because you know like you probably I'm very into I don't know what you call it that text
[55:59.700 --> 56:05.840]  editing of you know command option yep shift and arrow keys and I fly through text like
[56:05.840 --> 56:10.800]  crazy using that I don't know what and I feel utterly hobbled without it it's you know what
[56:10.800 --> 56:15.240]  it is it's a USB a situation all over again like it seems like about 50% of the time I
[56:15.240 --> 56:18.800]  should hit the right arrow up or down and I almost always get the wrong arrow and I
[56:18.800 --> 56:24.800]  don't know why I at some point very early in my days in a late 80s in high school when
[56:24.800 --> 56:31.320]  I first got on a Macintosh and I realized that in some app that you could you know use
[56:31.320 --> 56:35.720]  the shift key with the arrows to select text you know as you do it and then if you hold
[56:35.720 --> 56:40.960]  the option key it goes a word at a time and if you use the command key it'll go like to
[56:40.960 --> 56:46.280]  the beginning or end of the current line or paragraph and then I realized that it's exactly
[56:46.280 --> 56:51.200]  the same in every good Mac app and it was like ah this is that that's like where I fell
[56:51.200 --> 56:56.060]  in love with the Mac and those those like why was I never why was I never taught this
[56:56.060 --> 57:01.080]  it's so mental right and this is from an era when you know words you know like done that
[57:01.080 --> 57:05.000]  you know or even on the Apple you know that there'd be different command you know sequences
[57:05.000 --> 57:11.200]  for selecting and moving around text in every app every you know like DOS era or Apple I
[57:11.200 --> 57:16.040]  have just put I've just put the support Apple support doc into your show notes there you
[57:16.040 --> 57:21.080]  go because it's you I bet you I'll bet you dimes and donuts almost anybody who looks
[57:21.080 --> 57:24.760]  at this page you're gonna find five things on this page you didn't even know existed
[57:24.760 --> 57:28.200]  and it's it'll and once you internalize them it's mind-blowing and one of the best things
[57:28.200 --> 57:34.980]  about iOS is that iOS has inherited all of these or almost my iPad with a Bluetooth keyboard
[57:34.980 --> 57:39.760]  is a very powerful tool right now right and crazy and it's a big part to me it's a big
[57:39.760 --> 57:44.160]  part of the way that these iPad you know the Federico's and like Jason you know Jason Snell
[57:44.160 --> 57:49.320]  is doing it was just surprising to me because you know Federico is younger and his brain
[57:49.320 --> 57:52.500]  hasn't he's doing a lot of typing but I mean there are people who are editing like legit
[57:52.500 --> 57:58.040]  podcasts and like ferrite now people who prefer that over a Mac at this point but for whatever
[57:58.040 --> 58:05.280]  reason on a Mac keyboard at some point I also internalized that that gap above the left
[58:05.280 --> 58:12.120]  and right arrow keys I can't explain why the full height left and right arrow keys mess
[58:12.120 --> 58:16.560]  me up because in theory it should only be better right there they will make make the
[58:16.560 --> 58:20.560]  left and right keys half-height I'll be happy it's you know I'm saying well I don't all
[58:20.560 --> 58:25.400]  need to be big but if you just made even just making the left it's so what it is right now
[58:25.400 --> 58:29.300]  the left and right key are what we'll call full height and then the up and down arrow
[58:29.300 --> 58:34.700]  keys are in between our half-height and for whatever reason I find it virtually impossible
[58:34.700 --> 58:38.520]  to hit the right left and right one because I'm the proximity is just weird and I end
[58:38.520 --> 58:43.280]  up hitting the wrong one and I've just got this habit to locate my hand on those keys
[58:43.280 --> 58:47.540]  by the gap that exists when they were all half-height you know I'm doing it right now
[58:47.540 --> 58:51.440]  on this Bluetooth keyboard so my ring finger on my right hand rests above the right arrow
[58:51.440 --> 58:58.280]  key I'm smearing for my index finger on my right hand is on the left key this is basically
[58:58.280 --> 59:02.400]  if I'm my hands not on the mouse this is where my hand is and then my middle finger is on
[59:02.400 --> 59:07.480]  the up arrow that's just that is my posture on a keyboard I don't know I could not get
[59:07.480 --> 59:11.160]  used to it when I tried those keys and and I know that people are complaining about things
[59:11.160 --> 59:15.120]  like keys getting stuck and that's just a that's a bug in the design of the keyboard
[59:15.120 --> 59:19.840]  you know like Apple didn't deliver Apple didn't deliberately make it so that your E key would
[59:19.840 --> 59:23.080]  get stuck every once in a while but if you have a sandwich near that you may need to
[59:23.080 --> 59:26.480]  replace the top half of your computer right is the thing that happens now this new this
[59:26.480 --> 59:30.840]  new full height left and right arrow key is a deliberate design decision and it makes
[59:30.840 --> 59:38.360]  me insanely angry so you know it's cute and it weighs very little and it's nice but you
[59:38.360 --> 59:43.320]  know I you wouldn't believe the hour and a half that I spent trying to find the Mac that
[59:43.320 --> 59:49.080]  Marco was recommending the 2015 laptop long story short I've been thinking about getting
[59:49.080 --> 59:54.280]  a new laptop and I said because you know I'm awesome dad I'm like cool dad and so I'm ready
[59:54.280 --> 01:00:00.440]  to really spring this on my 10 year old daughter and I say you know in the event that dad gets
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:05.920]  a new laptop there's a chance that this guy right here could be yours and she's just like
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:11.520]  hmm I want a Chromebook like you want to what what you don't want go wash your mouth out
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:15.640]  with soap a Chromebook what kind of talk is that in this house because everything she
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:24.160]  uses is Apple iPad iPhone iPod you know Amazon yes but like every device that she uses is
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:27.880]  Apple but she loves the Chromebooks that they use at school and I asked her about it today
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:31.160]  I said I'm gonna talk to Uncle John Gruber tell me what the problem is you know what
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:35.560]  she likes about it she likes that it's heavy and big and sturdy and she likes she likes
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:42.080]  the large keyboard on it you know what that's actually that is that is not what I expected
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:47.960]  to hear I kind of get what she's I get it though right because you feel like you know
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:55.400]  it I you know it's whatever you're used to right well I mean that's yeah her typing her
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:58.960]  typing on a keyboard so in the morning when I brush her hair she looks at YouTube videos
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:03.280]  that's the extent of her using a physical keyboard at home you but you pick up the MacBook
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:08.440]  adorable and you if you're used to that big heavy chunky sturdy this feels like a sturdy
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.160]  piece of machinery that the MacBook adorable feels like a piece of glass that you're gonna
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.840]  bring consequential you feel like if you put your drink down wrong it's gonna go out the
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:21.360]  window right like a strong gust of wind is gonna take it oh my god so we had the big
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:25.200]  carnival at school and I swear this is not a jam-up my wife is the co-chair of the carnival
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:28.880]  one of the things we did we bought some of the stuff to be auctioned off and one of things
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:34.120]  was we we donated personally like an Amazon dot and we said hey you know people love these
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:37.280]  Chromebooks we should buy a Chromebook and we'll give that away and we'll you know get
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:42.920]  paid back by the school and I don't know if it works like this at your kid's school but
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:46.880]  there's seven parents at the school who do everything so not only do we put on the carnival
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:51.440]  but then we spent the most money at the carnival like we gave lots of money we bought like
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:56.360]  a hundred dollars in raffle tickets and guess what that did that produced a situation where
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:00.880]  we won the Chromebook that we had bought for the carnival and we were like no no seriously
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:05.000]  oh man we like everybody we were like seriously this is a jam-up like I'm gonna feel so bad
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.560]  if this is a jam-up and they're like no no no you legit won like you bought all the all
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:12.080]  the raffle tickets this feels like you're part of the Trump family now though right
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:20.120]  this feels I got the Javonka book right you're hosting State Department dinners at the Trump
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:25.400]  National Golf Course and it felt so wrong and so privileged and like we donated this
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:31.120]  and we won it merp but we were assured that there was a fair contest the truth is we're
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:35.800]  not going to expense it that you know if we won it we feel like well okay well you know
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:40.360]  we won't ask to be repaid for it but yeah no we won it we haven't set it up yet because
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:46.360]  I'm kind of going through this whole thing with my daughter about how we need to if you're
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:50.200]  gonna be on a computer like usually there's stuff we need to talk about and stuff you
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:53.180]  need to learn I know you think you know it but no you need to really really learn it
[01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:56.680]  like you're not gonna like your password and she cried when I told her that she couldn't
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:01.960]  use her fairly secure account password that she's got which is a one password English
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:07.740]  word dice where Pat Pat set of words but like no no no no no I'm in the industry the military
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:13.960]  grade password and you're gonna hate it but you know that's a vector right so but anyway
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:16.680]  I just thought that was funny I wanted to know we talked before about you know your
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:21.360]  son is the bellwether he's a little older than mine yeah my kid a few years and so like
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:27.680]  I feel like you get this stuff before I did um she loves the chrome what's what is his
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:33.480]  situation has no love for the Macintosh at all he likes oh my he doesn't she accuses
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:39.960]  kid same way yeah and you know molts his kid got a gaming laptop Dan's son is on a PC for
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:44.400]  games right now and Jonas I think if he had his druthers would have like a razor laptop
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:49.980]  or something are we old what happened I don't know it's like I said to you there was something
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:54.520]  you know literally it's not us it's the laptops that got small literally it's the elegance
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:04:01.320]  of things like having the same text editing shortcuts and those shortcuts being so sensible
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:05.120]  you know that it wasn't just that they were the same in all apps but that they were sensible
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:09.920]  and that there was this consistency and I don't know I fell in love with the Macintosh
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:15.740]  as soon as I saw it and I wanted to totally stuff with it and Jonas treats his as a thing
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:23.720]  that runs games and and a thing that runs YouTube I take the mouse I'm clicking on edit
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:29.060]  I'm clicking on copy when you watch people do that you're like oh my goodness like this
[01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:35.280]  is in my DNA at this point these key commands he does prefer he does he does prefer Safari
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:40.720]  over chrome and again this isn't through my proselytizing it he just doesn't you know
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:46.480]  it any and he totally gets it he believes it and sees it that chrome eats his battery
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:51.840]  life and that you know it's like his you know his laptop battery life is like everything
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:58.700]  right of course of course so he does prefer Safari over chrome so he has some of my some
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:04.880]  of my taste but all he really wants is a thing that you know and and I think he would prefer
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:11.400]  because the thing that get that gets him and I get it I get it is that there are as better
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:15.560]  as the Mac has gotten with games ever since they switched to Intel right where it's easier
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:19.960]  for game developers to do both what's the thing there's that service that's like Netflix
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:25.860]  for games what's it called like steam steam yeah so but there are games that come out
[01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:30.160]  on steam that are only available on Windows and aren't available on Mac and it bothers
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:38.400]  him right but the thing that the saving grace of that is that he's way more into the PlayStation
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:43.480]  4 than he is PC games but maybe that's because he has a MacBook Pro maybe if he had a gaming
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:48.160]  PC he'd be more into PC gaming I don't know but the only other the only other thing he
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:53.880]  does is the only other thing he does is watch YouTube and then way if he has homework it's
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:57.900]  all in Google Docs that's because that's what the school runs on and so if any if anything
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:01.920]  he'd be better off on a Chromebook probably I can only imagine that the Google Docs stuff
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:06.900]  runs better on it you know Chrome than anywhere else well one reason I'm resisting getting
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:10.480]  this together is I've never used a Chromebook I mean I I think I roughly understand how
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:14.440]  it is it's a device that's made to access mostly Google services right isn't that kind
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:18.480]  of well I mean anything you could do in a in a Chrome tab you know you know just really
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:23.480]  imagine a MacBook that was set like you know how like a like Docs and sheets and all that
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:28.640]  and all that kind of stuff plus the browser and all of that yeah yeah yeah I I've been
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:31.600]  a little bit resistance if I'm honest the part of the resistance is that I feel like
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:37.680]  I I need to understand how this device works like for example they gave um Microsoft gave
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:41.280]  Dan a Surface to try and like we'd really joked about it like oh god these idiots at
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:46.340]  Microsoft they were super nice they sent Dan the Surface and he kind of loves it like he
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:49.700]  thought it was pretty amazing and it been we had a pretty good episode about it where
[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:54.240]  he basically was saying like I really wish a lot of this stuff would come to the iPad
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:07:00.200]  and and but the thing is I'm so far out of my depth on PC stuff to begin with that like
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:04.560]  I'm not even sure I I would feel like I have to learn how to reuse a PC environment just
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:07.840]  to feel comfortable using it and that's the resistance I feel with the Chromebook we're
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:11.040]  like it might be as easy as in you just type a couple things in but I want to understand
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:14.640]  how it works before I give it to my kid I mean I guess that's probably kind of old-fashioned
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:21.480]  but that just seems advisable yeah it's I don't know it's it's a weird world what about
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:28.160]  the iOS stuff she uses like iPad 2 or no god she's so good she's like it's crazy we thought
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.760]  we might have talked about yeah I feel like we definitely talked about this a year ago
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:35.640]  because we talked about voice stuff last time right yeah um oh yeah that's right the way
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:41.640]  I yeah among other things last time is that she still she's less so a little less so now
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:45.880]  but up until very recently she would always prefer to click on the microphone and speak
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:52.520]  rather than use the keyboard which drove me bananas and I was like this is a keyboard
[01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:55.880]  it's a keyboard but she did it she made it work and she's in Safari and she wants to
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:08:00.580]  find out how to make you know slime and like she's able to just do that yeah she's great
[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:05.440]  she's super fast with it mostly looking at looking at videos to some extent she does
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:12.240]  Minecraft on the iPad and she's very into Lego worlds on the PlayStation right now those
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:18.960]  are her big games right now but no she's an ace she gets around really fast she's like
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:24.860]  they say I guess a digital native like there's nothing weird to her about this device I it
[01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:30.080]  in my gut I feel like in broad terms the difference is do you want a computer that acts like a
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:35.440]  computer like from like what you and I think of as computers from back in the day like
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:39.940]  a Commodore 64 you know like we to get anything done you kind of had to understand what the
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:45.720]  hell was actually how the thing actually works you know what I mean or are you using it more
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:50.400]  like an appliance like you're just at a higher level that's exactly the way to put it and
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:53.760]  it's not that they're not they have a task they have a task to accomplish with this they'll
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:57.320]  put up with whatever they need to to get there but they're not there for the polished user
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:01.040]  experience that we like to think that we're there for right it's like oh no and I actually
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:05.040]  you know Syracuse and I the directives that came out yesterday we were talking about steam
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.240]  and my experience using steam for the first time and he kind of took me to school on like
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:12.200]  what a huge deal steam well of course because it's their case about what a huge deal steam
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:16.500]  was finally there's these games are now available on the Mac but I was like this app is hot
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:20.600]  garbage those aren't real window widgets right somebody painted on it with like a magic marker
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:26.120]  this looks like malware why would I use this and he's like you know and I anyway of course
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:29.440]  we had 45 minutes of arguing about that but that was my thing when I first opened steam
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:33.720]  I was like you've got to be kidding me I what do I need to also update my flash like this
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:38.520]  looks like the fakest malware thing I've ever seen it looks like the steam app looks like
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:44.080]  it looks like the app that Tom Cruise uses to communicate with the Mission Impossible
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:50.340]  team I am definitely using a computer yeah are you getting this yeah it should be like
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:54.440]  beeping and whirring on every keystroke like beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:59.840]  beep by hacking the encryption you're in right
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:04.440]  typing noises typing noises timing noises and and scrolling noises right is that you
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:07.600]  know what I mean about the window widgets the yellow green yeah it looks like somebody
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:11.240]  used a magic marker to paint those on there it's not even from an EOS that I've seen like
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:18.600]  in five years it looks totally made up I've I've got some part of my brain that you know
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:24.240]  like a lizard lizard level part of my brain that it's supposed to recognize threats like
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:29.540]  you know, you're out in the woods picking berries, you know, 2,500 years ago and something
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:34.880]  dangerous is in your eyesight. And before you even know what it is, you're already,
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:38.700]  you know, like, you know, your, your hair standing on edge and the adrenaline's popping.
[01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:41.440]  That's what you hear. You just, you just hear a rattle. Yeah. That's what happens to me
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:46.800]  when I see a non-native app. I know, I know. I'm like, I said a Syracuse, I said, it looks
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:51.620]  like swing. I feel like I'm using a Java app from like 15, 20 years ago. I'm like this.
[01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:55.880]  It looks like, it looks like somebody explained the way a Mac application should look over
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:11:00.620]  a bad cell phone. And then they fax that to the people to put up as the app. I haven't
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:04.500]  even looked at how steam works, but like, I wouldn't even be surprised if like, instead
[01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:09.740]  of writing its data to like, you know, library slash preferences or something like that,
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:15.900]  that it's just writing it to a, a dot folder at the top level of your home directory, like
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:21.740]  an entourage. Let's put all your mail in this one very large document. Yeah. I mean, I don't
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:24.020]  think, again, I don't, I say that not to, not to bitch about steam. It sounds like a
[01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:27.380]  very good service. I'm sure gamers are very happy with it, but it's more to say like,
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:31.580]  you know, this is, this really does feel like a cultural distinction. Something, something
[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:35.020]  I've been talking about, I feel like we've been talking about for a while. Like one of
[01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:38.980]  the reasons you don't have a Mac world anymore is because as I believe Steve said, there's
[01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:42.620]  Mac worlds going on every day at stores all over the world. And the thing I keep beating
[01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:45.940]  on is, and people would look at me quizzically the last five years, but I don't think people
[01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:50.780]  self identify as Apple people in a significant way like they used to. There was a time when
[01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:54.740]  we really felt like the outcasts, the outsiders, the weirdos, the cool kids for using Apple
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:59.340]  stuff and blowing all our money on Apple stuff. I don't think when I see people on Muni quitting
[01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:03.340]  all their apps on their iPhone, I don't think they self identify as like, Oh, there might
[01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:07.700]  be the status of I am an iPhone user, but I don't think they see themselves as part
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:14.060]  of this winking hipster, tiny glasses, Helvetica tradition of using the best UX device, right?
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:22.100]  And that you understand the the idiomatic grammar of the UI, right? And you, it's just
[01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:29.040]  in the same way that you can instantly, everybody can instantly recognize a English as a second
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:36.300]  language person through, through the, the incorrect idioms they use, right? It's understandable,
[01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:40.140]  but it's not, yeah, you get it, but you can totally see like, and that, you know, and
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:46.220]  that people from certain, whatever language they're coming from will make the same sort
[01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:51.100]  of mistakes. Like somebody who learned, like my friend Lee, who, who, you know, speaks,
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:57.380]  grew up in Vietnam. He makes plural mistakes because there's totally different rules for
[01:12:57.380 --> 01:13:01.700]  when you make things plural or there are no plurals and in Vietnamese or something like,
[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:06.460]  you know, that would be complicated, but you know what I mean? But he'll often leave off
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:12.260]  the ass and, and, and it, it, it, it does an egg and egg and egg and egg and egg and
[01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:17.460]  egg. You know what I mean? And, and I do, I do. Well, and it's a, you can hear it, especially
[01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:21.980]  in speakers of things like Russian. We're like a perfect example, because the sentence
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:25.740]  construction is, you know, you'll, you'll hear backloading and front loading of certain
[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:30.620]  kinds of parts of, you know, in the way that we have this, the way that the incredibly
[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:35.240]  weird and complex way that we use adjectives, adjectives always go in a certain order for
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:39.300]  some reason in English and no one, you feel it, but you can't like identify it, but you
[01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:43.860]  know, when somebody does it wrong. Yes, exactly. You know, you, you wouldn't say something
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:55.060]  like, Oh, I saw an angry while I saw a Brown wild angry dog, right? There's this certain
[01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:58.860]  way that, and there's actually a wonderful book about this, about the ways that there's
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:02.740]  all these little like unconscious things in English. But anyway, I take, I take your meeting.
[01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:07.500]  Yeah, I was just, I don't know, disappointed. That's a stupid word cause I didn't even realize
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:14.020]  I was appointed. I, I, I just assumed that she would want to have a Mac. Do I should
[01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:18.060]  find this for you? Cause as the language nerd, you will really appreciate this. Yeah, here
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:23.540]  we go. Adjectives in English absolutely have to be in this order. Opinion, size, age, shape,
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:29.220]  color, origin, material, purpose, noun. So you can have a lovely little old rectangular
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:34.900]  green French silver whittling knife. But if you mess that word order in the slightest,
[01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:40.540]  you'll sound like a maniac. It's an odd thing that every English speaker uses that list,
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:45.640]  but almost none of us could write it out. And as size comes before color, as size comes
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:52.480]  before color, green, great dragons can't exist. What is that book? I don't know. I've got
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:58.300]  a, I've got an eye. It's the elements of eloquence. That's it. It's so good. And it's so well
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:02.260]  written. Do you, have you read it? No, I haven't. I, but I read this guardian article that I'm
[01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:05.780]  pasting into the show notes as, as we speak. Yeah, I learned about it from, I feel like
[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:11.520]  Paul Bausch and I, it's, it's a wonderful like idiom to idiom. Like he describes this
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:15.500]  certain kind of an effect in, in Greek or whatever. And then, and that leads us to this
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:19.660]  and boom, that's the next entry. It's an imminently readable book. It's so good. Highly recommended
[01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:24.260]  eloquence. What is it? The elements, elements of eloquence. There we go. There's another
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:29.580]  gift idea for a good, that's a good idea. The English speaking nerd in your, so anyway,
[01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:34.220]  in a way that you can know that I know the same thing for user interface. I can absolutely
[01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:39.300]  positively in an instant tell when an app was designed by somebody who does not, uh,
[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:44.620]  was not a, you know, a native Mac UI designer. And you know, in the old days it would be
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:50.500]  like a windows style app. It could just be something like a super wordy dialog box. You're
[01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:54.360]  like, Hmm, this is your first day, isn't it? You don't put that many words in a dialog
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:59.780]  box or a dialog box where you see the logic of it, but the order of which controls go
[01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:06.300]  where and what size they are is like nonsensical or if it says cancel and retry. Yeah, yeah,
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:11.260]  no, I totally know what you mean. Yeah. My, my, my brief dalliance just as a side note,
[01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:18.660]  my brief dalliance with PC stuff was, um, circa 2001 when I had to do some cold fusion
[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:22.940]  stuff for work and I had to learn a little bit of cold fusion and it was really, there
[01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:27.700]  was the only sensible way to do cold fusion was on a PC and it was so strange. It was
[01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:31.520]  just enough to drive me crazy. It was like just enough to make me feel nuts. We're moving
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:36.180]  between spending 30% time on the PC and the rest of my time on a Mac made me feel nuts.
[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:41.220]  Like where stuff was on the keyboard, how the mouse worked. I got equally bad at both
[01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:45.300]  when I used both. I didn't get better at one or the other. I got, I got, I kept getting
[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:51.740]  worse at both as I used to. I just pasted into the thing there. It's a recent post from
[01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:57.460]  the amazing Dr Drang where he has a, he's talking about converting fractions to decimal
[01:16:57.460 --> 01:17:00.820]  values and how he used to do it in excel, but he doesn't use excel anymore, but he paste
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:06.260]  a screenshot from excel and it's a die. This is a, this is the current version of Microsoft
[01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:11.700]  excel on Mac. Well, I sent it to you and I messaged. You can see, I got it. I got it.
[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:17.380]  This dialogue box is a perfect example. Oh my goodness. Oh, it's got Redmond all over
[01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:24.020]  it. I don't know how to describe it. I'll put it in the, uh, right now I'm going to,
[01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:27.040]  I'm going to make it, I'm going to do the thing where right now you could just look
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:33.020]  at your iPhone and, and this will be the cover art. Now I understand this dialog box. I understand
[01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:38.340]  everything that's going on in here. I'm not confused, right? No, it looks like it was
[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:42.680]  designed by an engineer or an engineer would look at this and go, what's the problem? Every
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:46.340]  option you would need is available here to select and it's got a, it's got, it's got
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:52.880]  three levels. It's got three levels of, of UI. You go from a tab to like a selection
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:58.540]  left rail to a sub selection, big text area, not text area, but selection area.
[01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:03.940]  Right. And then what this says, 16th, you click on this, you go to that and that. And
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:08.120]  there's this list of items for type and it doesn't take up nearly as much space as it
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:12.540]  could or should, but you can see why the engineer who made it did it this way. Cause look at
[01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:17.740]  the scroll bar, there aren't anymore. So if you only need 10 items, just make it 10 high,
[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:22.020]  regardless of how it looks into that. Oh no. Why did you say that? Oh no. Now I see it.
[01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:28.540]  Oh no. Oh no, no, no. It did. That one didn't have to be so tall in this. Oh no, no. This
[01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:33.260]  is very troubling. Is that because when you go to alignment font, border filler protection,
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:37.880]  I don't know. Category needs to look at the way the words, the label sample doesn't line
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:43.820]  up with the label type. Oh, that's very upsetting. It's all very upsetting. These are the sort
[01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:48.200]  of the padding on the sample is not good. These are the sort of things that bother me,
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:53.860]  but this is a minor thing compared to, compared to steam. You can get this, you can get this.
[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:59.020]  It isn't like there's like a, it isn't like there's a hastily drawn like octagon with
[01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:03.180]  a child's handwriting on it that says, okay, that's what steam feels. So what makes me
[01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:07.560]  sad? Here's the thing that makes me sad about this is that in the old days and even today
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:11.660]  you still see it here. Here's like a windows style UI on the Mac and it always makes me
[01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:17.180]  sad. But what I see more and more today is a Mac apps that are written by people who
[01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:23.300]  clearly are iOS developers and never really, the only Mac app they ever use is X, interesting,
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:28.900]  interesting. See these iOS style apps and it is, it kills me cause there's things like,
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:34.420]  Oh, you can't copy and paste. It's like, why can't I copy and paste? What are you doing
[01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:40.220]  here? Strange. That's so strange. I'm just looking at the original control panel on a
[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:47.180]  Mac or that they don't like one thing like an app made by, uh, I hate this. I hate this
[01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:54.040]  trend with the passion of a thousand sons is, um, these Mac apps that run not as like
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:58.540]  a Mac app with a menu bar or you know, and that you can command tattoo like the cute
[01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:03.540]  ones that run in their own little menu. They run as a little widget up in the menu bar
[01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:09.780]  in the top right. Where is this? I don't know where this lives. This isn't a secret room
[01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:13.060]  in my house that I can't find and I have to tap on the wall to know if it's there. It's
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:16.660]  so strange, but it's because their mindset is they don't, they don't think about apps
[01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:20.940]  as having a menu bar and having windows that you click through. It is just like a screen
[01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:25.220]  and so they just make like an iPhone size app and it runs. You click on a thing in the
[01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:31.460]  top right and it hangs down from the menu bar and there it is. I hate it. Bartender
[01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:36.460]  love bartender hides, hide so many things. Uh, do you ever hear of, there's a, there's
[01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:45.500]  a arrival app to bartender called vanilla. So you know how bartender, so Bart, there's
[01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:49.020]  two utilities that do this. They let you, they're great. I recommend anybody out, especially
[01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:55.560]  if you have a laptop because you, I hate the apps that run in the menu bar and even though
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:21:01.820]  I hate them, I still have so many of them that, that I, you need them like, you know,
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:06.460]  this is how I get to Google photos. This is how I get to back blaze. This is how I get
[01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:09.140]  to all kinds of stuff in here. Do you know what I miss? I forget who I was talking about
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:12.860]  a couple episodes ago, but the thing I really missed, one of the things I missed the most
[01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:18.460]  from classic Mac OS is the control strip. Remember that? Oh yeah. Grabby's on it. That
[01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:23.300]  was great. And it was the, it was the, it was where things like that lived and you could,
[01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:28.660]  they'd go away, you'd click on it, they'd come back. It was so elegant. It looked cool,
[01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:34.460]  right? I missed the accordion pop out thing. Yep, exactly. Yeah. I, you know, I miss that
[01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:39.760]  with windows more like a lot of times because I'm an animal, I'll be listening to overcast
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:44.300]  and the web browser on my iMac and I'll usually just, you know, double click Chrome to like
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:49.260]  make it go down to the dock. And I missed that ability to like have things kind of pop
[01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:53.700]  up without becoming fully on screen. Do you remember what I'm talking about? Yeah, I know
[01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:59.740]  exactly what you're talking about. Oh man. Vanilla. Okay. This looks pretty good. It's
[01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:03.620]  free. Yeah. I don't know why it's free. I wish that this guy would, I wish he would
[01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:08.580]  charge me a couple bucks for it. Thanks, Matthew Palmer. Yeah, I'll put it in the show notes.
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:12.340]  Did you want to tell me about anything else you like? You know what? I would love to.
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:17.900]  That's actually a, that's actually a perfect segue. Now look, I'm telling you right now
[01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:22.620]  that it's fracture. Oh, you guys know fracture. You'd know fracture, but you also know it's
[01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:26.660]  mid November and I've been telling you for, I think this is the third episode in a road
[01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:31.540]  where fractures been a sponsor and every single time I've told you that you should already,
[01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:35.940]  you should pause the podcast and go order some fracture prints for your, your, your
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:42.380]  family. Go do it because they're Fanta a, they are fantastic gifts. You let's circle
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:45.360]  back to that because I want to talk about, you'll be, you'll be praised a high. You gotta,
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:50.020]  you gotta get the order in you guys because by fracture elves have to get to work making
[01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:55.700]  your fracture, right? These things are made handmade, handmade by a happy team in Gainesville,
[01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:59.980]  Florida, but from us source materials, but they get backed up at some point in early
[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:04.500]  December. They're going to say, you know what? Any border after this date is going to be
[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:09.740]  too late for, for Christmas or whatever other holidays you might be celebrating. Do it now.
[01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:12.540]  You'll feel so much better. I'm telling you, this is the last one I'm telling you right
[01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:17.620]  now. I'll give you a sneak peek. Is your last warning? Well, it is for the holidays. I know
[01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:21.540]  I happen to know for a fact that the next episode of the show, the fracture is not a,
[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:25.500]  they're not sponsoring it there. This is the third of three in a row. Um, and I think the
[01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:29.780]  reason why is that by, by the end of November it might be too late already. You know, I'm
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:33.540]  telling you heartbreaking, heartbreaking. Get on it now. These are such good gifts.
[01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:38.100]  This is the most no brainer, no brainer gift of all time. It's so easy to do their site.
[01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:42.700]  Can I take over for a second? Yeah. Their site is so fun to use. It's almost like using
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:46.520]  flicker back in the day. It just feels like magic that you take a photo. It goes, Oh,
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:49.780]  it looks like you want this kind of fraction. Yeah, I totally want this. Should I make some
[01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:54.340]  more? Yeah. Make some more and then send that to your mom. Tell her I said hi. I've, I'm
[01:23:54.340 --> 01:24:00.820]  a terrible gift giver. I, and so far as that I struggle to, I struggle to buy thoughtful
[01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:06.900]  gifts for people like my wife who I know intimately and love dearly and I cannot figure out what
[01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:12.580]  to get. I cannot, and let alone, uh, people more distant, uh, fracture gifts I think are
[01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:17.380]  the only gift I've ever given anybody where it's like actually triggered like a tearful
[01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:22.220]  joy. Wow. Right. It is. It, you know, think about it like, I don't know, maybe you've
[01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:26.700]  got like a 10 year old kid. Give your, you know, the kids, grandparents, your parents,
[01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:30.660]  give them a picture of the kid from, I don't know, five years ago or six years ago or something
[01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:34.900]  like that where there's a real easy one. I, especially if your kids don't get to see that
[01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:39.300]  the grandparents or family members as much as you like, open up your iOS device. And
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:42.740]  if you're the sort of person like me who favorites photos, just go into your, go into your photos
[01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:46.340]  and look at some favorites and then look at them like you're the person who might receive
[01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:49.860]  that fracture and think about how thrilled they would be to get that little, that closeup
[01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:55.220]  of that sweet little face. I'm telling you, this thing is a great gift idea, but you are,
[01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:58.440]  this is the special, you know, I don't know if you knew this, Merlin, this is our Thanksgiving
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:05.660]  spectacular. No, not a holiday party yet. Well, no, it is a holiday party, but it's,
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:12.380]  it's run under giving man. Thanks for having me on. So the holidays are officially started
[01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:17.300]  like this is the, the Thanksgiving episode of, of the talk show. There won't, will not
[01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:20.900]  be another episode until after Thanksgiving. I'm telling you, it might be too late. Don't
[01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:24.380]  just beat the holiday rush. Don't wait until December. I'm telling you that their order
[01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:30.000]  queue fuels up. Ordering a simple, like Merlin said, the website is a joy. You have so many
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.440]  selections for size you could get, you know, get them a big one, get them a small one.
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:38.440]  Everything that you need comes in the package that to hang it on a wall, to prop it up on
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:45.780]  a mantle or a desk or whatever. And the picture quality is fantastic. And this edge to edge
[01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:50.300]  thing, it's no joke. It makes you, it makes every other way to hang a print of a photo
[01:25:50.300 --> 01:26:01.220]  seem outdated. So where do you go? Go to fracture.me, fracture.me or fracture me.com and say 15%
[01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:10.420]  off your first fracture order with the exclusive code. Talk 15 that's T a L K 15. And the talk
[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:14.580]  comes from the talk show. I presume in the 15 is the 15% you will save on your first
[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:21.360]  fracture order. And do not forget at the end of your purchase, they will ask you a one
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:27.980]  question survey. And that question is what's your middle name? No, the question is where
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:33.500]  did you hear about this podcast? And you can tell them you heard about it here and it will
[01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:37.980]  help support the show. But I'm telling you right now, don't, don't delay. Don't wait.
[01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:42.220]  Do it right now. Do it. Just go like Merlin said, go into your favorites, go in your favorites
[01:26:42.220 --> 01:26:46.020]  and just pick a bunch of them and get them printed up. You'll be so thankful and you'll
[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:49.680]  be like, thank God John Gruber reminded me to get these fracture prints. You said you
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:59.740]  saved Christmas again. Yeah. Good sponsor. Oh my God. They're, they're the best of ours.
[01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:06.100]  You know, a year ago, I don't know what else you want. Oh God. Oh my God. We got to do
[01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:12.940]  a year ago. We had, we had a, we had a holiday party in early November at the day after election
[01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:17.740]  day. Was it the day after? Did we record on Wednesday? The morning, the morning, morning
[01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:26.260]  after you were, you were still a celebrating. I'll never forget. We're going to miss a few
[01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:32.420]  people. We're going to try to, we're going to try to get everybody. We're going to miss
[01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:44.420]  a few people. We were both, um, in a pretty bad way and it was very fresh and very raw
[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:49.260]  and uh, and I got to tell you, you know what, I'm probably stealing your thunder here, but
[01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:57.340]  I feel like I've done a fair number of podcast programs over the years. I feel like the reaction
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:03.780]  that I got from that has been larger and more positive than probably anything I've ever
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:07.540]  done. The only thing I could compare it to, and it's, I don't think it's a coincidence.
[01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:13.300]  I think you and I, we do have a, we have a rep our tour, but the, uh, the thing we did
[01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:17.040]  at South by Southwest back. Oh, that was good. Yeah, that was good. But it was, you know,
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:21.200]  I think we're not trying to make it sound like heroes or something cause we basically
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:24.140]  just got up here and we're like, I don't know what the hell is going on, which as it happened
[01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:27.380]  was what pretty much everybody I know was thinking that day. Yeah, but really kind of
[01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:30.840]  mostly for a year. That's kind of mostly what it's felt like. I still don't really know
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:34.540]  what's going on. The thing that got me and I know you saw it cause we were interacting
[01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:38.280]  with the same people at Twitter, but it was right around election day or the one year
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:44.180]  anniversary a week or so ago, 10 days ago where just out of the woodwork, a slew of
[01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:47.940]  people on Twitter were thanking us for that episode saying that not only did it help them
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:55.280]  a year ago when it came out to cope with the surprising election of Donald Trump as president,
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:59.540]  but that in the intervening year they've listened to that episode multiple times or that they
[01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:03.540]  it on the one year anniversary, they, they listened again and enjoyed it every bit as
[01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:08.580]  again and felt better because of it again. And at, uh, you know, this is the talk show
[01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:14.340]  is this show is not that a sort of evergreen listen to episodes over and over again, you
[01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:19.460]  know, type of show. It is sort of a what's going on this week type of show for the most
[01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:25.280]  part. Mm hmm. Um, and so to hear that about an episode that we did not plan and, and that
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:30.340]  I was, well, and also, you know, I, I'm really grateful to everybody for saying that. I'm
[01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:33.860]  super grateful to everybody for listening cause it was the word that, uh, the only word
[01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:39.820]  I can really come up with, it wasn't fun, but it was cathartic in some ways. Yeah. Um,
[01:29:39.820 --> 01:29:46.340]  where it's, it's, it's, I don't even know what to say. It's difficult. Well, like I'm
[01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:49.160]  going through right this very second, it's difficult to not be able to articulate what
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:51.660]  you're feeling, to have complicated feelings, to know that it's not a particularly good
[01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:56.140]  feeling, but it's one nice thing about having a podcast. If you have, if you have the means,
[01:29:56.140 --> 01:29:59.840]  I highly recommend it. Get a podcast because it is an opportunity to think out loud a little
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:03.660]  bit and you may not exactly figure things out, but you do a rough draft of what's on
[01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:08.020]  your mind and that that was useful and I'm really glad I had something to fill my time
[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:16.540]  that morning. Oh my God. I responses. It really was. And I think people get it and uh, and
[01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:21.380]  we tried to emphasize at the beginning that we're not trying to get a political on it
[01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:26.960]  because I think that was so upsetting about it as opposed to just say, for example, like
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:36.860]  the election and reelection of George W. Bush, uh, 15 years ago, you know, what, what, for
[01:30:36.860 --> 01:30:44.860]  example, me, I found that unpleasant, but it, it did not feel, um, like the world had
[01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:49.620]  been ripped asunder, right? It felt like, well, there are people on one side of this
[01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:55.140]  argument and there are people on the other side and more people, uh, well, at least in
[01:30:55.140 --> 01:31:00.980]  the 2004 election, more people voted on the other side. Back to my dumb baseball analogy
[01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:03.980]  where I had said, I felt like I, it wasn't that my team lost, but I don't understand
[01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:09.620]  baseball like George. Well, sometimes when you lose an election, it's, it's a painful
[01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:14.700]  loss of a game, but you don't fundamentally question the, whether you understand how the
[01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:19.020]  sport works. Right. You know? And so like, I'm trying to figure out something smart to
[01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:24.220]  say or talk about on here and I don't have very much except to say that like, I don't
[01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:29.900]  know. There's one thing I want to say upfront, which is that I, that I, I feel like I regret
[01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:33.180]  because it was very privileged of me to say, but we both kind of agreed, Oh, everything's
[01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:36.740]  going to be fine. Probably like we'll come out of this fine. I hope you will allow us
[01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:41.180]  a little bit of happy talk on a very difficult day to say, Hey, chin up, this is going to
[01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:46.420]  be fine. But you know, the truth is it, we could have even known then that it wasn't
[01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:52.720]  going to be fine. Yeah. So I don't say I apologize, I guess I apologize if I was coming at that
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:56.740]  from a privileged position. It's, it's now clear to me that everything's not, hasn't
[01:31:56.740 --> 01:32:03.500]  gone fine and won't be fine. That sucks. The thing that's amazing for me is, Oh, and then
[01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:06.860]  the other thing I think nested, we didn't talk about this, but you know, we're not supposed
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:13.780]  to talk about this at all, but I got to tell you, John, in my mind on that day, I know
[01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:19.420]  this is completely irrational, but I swear to God, I thought he would, for whatever reason,
[01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:23.900]  for any of the many reasons I could come up with, I really did not think that he would
[01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:29.460]  be president today. I did not think he'd make even six months in there. I really, there's
[01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:34.220]  a part of me that thought this is all so going off the rails. I don't think he's going to
[01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:37.740]  be around even in six months, let alone in four years, which obviously I was wrong about
[01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:41.120]  as well. Did you have some part of your mind that thought that though, like this is so
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:45.180]  aberrant that it's going to have to like the way you get a little splinter and your skin
[01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:49.380]  eventually kind of pushes it out of its own accord. Didn't it kind of feel like the system
[01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:53.440]  would try to correct this in some way?
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:33:01.260]  Part of me thought it and then part of me, you know, thought, but he's so part, I really
[01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:08.060]  do believe it. And I really think that he suffers from a severe narcissism, mental disorder,
[01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:13.100]  and that it's just, that's just not a recipe for, to be taken out. And, and I, you know,
[01:33:13.100 --> 01:33:21.460]  it really does require, uh, I don't know. I, I, part of me thought it would happen,
[01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:25.180]  but part of me, cause I really do think that he is not mentally well in a very dangerous
[01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:26.180]  way. I really do.
[01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:31.380]  I'm not limiting this to the, what we talked about today with impeachment or 25th amendment.
[01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:36.300]  I just thought there's, there's so many grenades rolling around in this campaign. It just seems
[01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:40.740]  like it's, it's, there's like 50 different reasons this shouldn't be. And it seems like
[01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:43.900]  the system would take care of that one way or another. It just seemed implausible that
[01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:46.260]  he would still be in that office.
[01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:52.540]  The system just wasn't ready for it. It really wasn't, you know, it's, you know, I think,
[01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:57.060]  I don't know if I used this last year or not, or if I've used it before, but, uh, but the
[01:33:57.060 --> 01:34:03.620]  way that our, our system works is, um, like, like in an official basketball game, like
[01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:07.840]  if you go to watch an NBA game, there's a referee and the referee, the rack, you know,
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:11.860]  or even like even organized, uh, recreational league and there's referees. And like when
[01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:15.300]  I used to play rec league basketball, like the, you know, each team would have to bring
[01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:19.500]  like 15 bucks and you pay the refs, you know, and, and the refs, if the refs say it's a
[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:23.520]  foul, it's a foul and that's it. And there's nothing you can do about it. Whereas the political
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:27.340]  system is more like a pickup game of basketball where there's five guys on one team and five
[01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:34.580]  on another and you've got to call your own files. And you know, when I grew up, it's
[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:38.100]  a funny thing. Like it's just like a difference between the suburbs and the city. When I grew
[01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:44.980]  up playing pickup basketball in the suburbs, um, the defense called fouls. And so if, if
[01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:49.940]  you, I was guarding you and you went up for a shot and I know that I touched your arm,
[01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:54.980]  it was up to me to call the foul. And if I didn't, you would say, oh, come on, that's
[01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:58.980]  a foul, but too bad the game goes on. But that's, that would be dishonorable. Well,
[01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:02.720]  it would be dishonorable and I'm going to get my come up and it's on the other end if
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:07.300]  I do it more than twice. Right. And you know, and if I'm habitually doing it, I'm going
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:11.860]  to stop being invited to play because we have, you know, you, you know what I mean? It's
[01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:17.220]  actually a really good analogy. And in the city, when I came to Philadelphia in the early
[01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:22.980]  nineties to go to college in the city, the offense calls the files, but the logic holds.
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:26.400]  And if you're the type of player who every time you get your shot blocked, whether it's
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:31.580]  a foul or not, you call foul, they're going to start, they're going to start, uh, you
[01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:34.460]  know, you're going to get your come up and it's on the other end. You know, the other
[01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:37.860]  team is going to start calling fouls when they get their shots blocked too. You know,
[01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:41.060]  just to, you know, if you're going to do it, I'm going to do it. It's like mutually assured
[01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:46.060]  destruction. Like what happens though when there's one of the teams doesn't even want
[01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:52.060]  to play basketball and they just, and also imagine this is something that seems unique
[01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:55.620]  about the position that he holds right now, which is that there are all kinds of safeguards
[01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:59.540]  in place all the way up to vice president. There are, there are all kinds of things in
[01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:04.180]  like hearings and weddings and disclosures that you have to do, um, about your interests
[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:13.320]  in things. Um, and there are, are, can be very severe penalties for all sorts of ethical
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:18.460]  issues at every level of government except for one. And there is something unique. I'm
[01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:22.240]  not a scholar on this, but it's my understanding that there's a lot of stuff where that never
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:25.220]  even occurred to them to say, Oh yeah, the president has to do that too. Cause it was
[01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:29.660]  just always assumed it would be somebody of good, good conscious who was an honorable
[01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:33.860]  player. Um, I don't want to turn this into just bagging on the man, but you just kind
[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:40.860]  of assumed that like, it's just so crazy how much the kind of stuff that he says on Twitter
[01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:44.980]  that not only would nobody, nobody in government, even at like school board level ever say on
[01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:48.740]  Twitter, but the fact that he's basically admitting to things that would get so many
[01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:53.820]  other people in so much trouble feels so frustrating that that, and then to be so kind of, kind
[01:36:53.820 --> 01:37:02.360]  of proud of this, you know, what's your word? Kekka Kekka tocracy. Oh, Kekka Kekka. Something
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:10.580]  like that. Yeah. Anyways, government by the worst people. Yeah. Fantastic word. And it
[01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:16.500]  actually sues me that that word exists and comes from the ancient Greeks because it makes
[01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:20.260]  me think that maybe it's not unprecedented. Like it's certainly unprecedented in the United
[01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:26.140]  States, but you know, it's like the older I get, the more I realized that, you know,
[01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:30.020]  even 200 years ago isn't that long ago. Right. You know what I mean? Like you can start gaining
[01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:35.460]  that perspective and that, you know, this sort of thing has happened before that. That's
[01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:41.540]  the only thing that's unprecedented is, you know, the nuclear shame. Oh yeah. That too.
[01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:45.060]  The shame, the shame of the nuclear. Well, the worst, the worst case scenario is an awful
[01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:51.140]  lot worse than it might've been back in Plato's day. Right. Maniac gets, gets in charge. Not
[01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:58.540]  like calling traveling. Right. But they're doing bad people and, and they're so incompetent.
[01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:01.620]  That's the part that kills me and that kills me. I'm kind of glad for us. I just figured,
[01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:05.460]  I figured they would just starting with the travel ban. That was such an interesting couple
[01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:10.320]  of weeks because it became immediately apparent that these guys were not firing on all cylinders,
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:15.260]  that they could screw up a wet dream if they chose to. And that the, what the, the one
[01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:21.220]  saving grace has been just the, the, the utter lack of control, administration and competence
[01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:25.700]  that could make, could have made this so much worse. You know, that's, that, that's the
[01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:29.900]  part that's a little bit mind blowing is like the thing that makes it even more of a grenade
[01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:34.060]  rolling around is you're like, wow, he really does think he's doing a great job at this.
[01:38:34.060 --> 01:38:38.860]  It's really strange. The thing that I have found over the past year that's really, I've,
[01:38:38.860 --> 01:38:42.420]  I've really, I have not put my head in the sand and I'm paying attention to politics
[01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:47.420]  as much as I ever had before. But some of my very favorite people to follow on this
[01:38:47.420 --> 01:38:53.540]  are real Republicans, conservatives who are, have their wise wide open and are calling
[01:38:53.540 --> 01:38:57.900]  this out for what it is like to that come to mind. And I, I read their columns. I think
[01:38:57.900 --> 01:39:04.140]  they're great writers and I just find myself saying, yes, this is a David from who was
[01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:09.580]  formerly George W. Bush's speech writer. I mean his conservative bona fides are that
[01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:17.660]  he came up with the axis of evil line for what, North Korea, Iran and Iraq, Iraq in
[01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:21.160]  the lead up to the Iraq war. You know, I mean it was George W. Bush's speech writer who
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:27.880]  came up with this axis of evil sort of muscular, you know, you know, it, this is not a, a middle
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:33.780]  of the road Republican, but he's totally calling this out for what it is in terms of a, they're
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:43.580]  in competence and be the corruption, the outright corruption and the the, the just lying, you
[01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:49.740]  know, the, just, just plainly lying about something that is demonstrably that you can
[01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:54.900]  demonstrate is untrue, right? You know, like one of the interesting things of you know,
[01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:59.740]  again, it's almost like we're smoking weed in college, but you know, the long standing
[01:39:59.740 --> 01:40:06.300]  debate about who was the mid century writer who got the, the, the dystopian future, right?
[01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:12.580]  Was it Huxley or was it Orwell? And, and everybody was so afraid Orwell's future seemed so much
[01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:18.360]  scarier and everybody, but then, you know, there were a lot of good arguments to be made
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:24.500]  before the last five, 10 years that Huxley was the one who, who, who was more on point
[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:27.780]  and, you know, it's not one or the other. They were both brilliant, but, but that this,
[01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:31.700]  you know, entertain them at, you know, you don't have to lie and you don't have to oppress
[01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:36.140]  them, just entertain them and they won't pay attention and you know, all sorts of bad things
[01:40:36.140 --> 01:40:42.740]  can happen. But to me, the Trump administration has really woken up the Orwellian aspect of
[01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:48.460]  it, right? Like it really literally from day one with, with the, the, the, the goofy thing
[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:54.740]  where they're, you know, it was a sparsely attended inauguration. It was a sparsely attended
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:59.660]  inauguration. You can look at, you can look at it with your eyeballs and photographs taken
[01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:07.100]  with the exact same camera focal length from the exact same vantage point showing how much,
[01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:12.440]  you know, maybe hundreds of thousands fewer people attending it. And, and the White House
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:17.180]  press secretary with spit coming out of his mouth and his face. That was his introduction.
[01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:20.940]  That was his introduction. And now we know we can, we can, we have, it's a far first
[01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:26.140]  sign that we're going to have to confront an administration that's going to be defined
[01:41:26.140 --> 01:41:31.420]  by the pettiness of the lie they're willing to defend. And like that's such a small, you
[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:34.260]  know, you know, I don't want to have this argument. You think I want to argue about
[01:41:34.260 --> 01:41:38.520]  how many people were standing in an area? What a strange thing to be spending our time
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:42.460]  on. But the fact that he has, so I, you know me, I do not use double down because that
[01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:47.380]  has a special meaning, but to redouble his efforts to prove this thing that is demonstrably
[01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:51.700]  untrue, even though it's completely petty and unnecessary to everybody but him, makes
[01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:55.940]  it an issue. And now we're in that too. Yeah. Oh, that was a tough day for Sean. That was
[01:41:55.940 --> 01:42:01.300]  a tough first day on the job. He has his big boy suit on. Remember that? Yeah, I do. I
[01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:09.220]  do. My little turtle man. The original joke, the more he lies, the smaller his head gets.
[01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:15.580]  I don't know, but it was true. It's just bizarre. It just was the sort of thing. And again,
[01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:18.980]  I don't think that's political, you know what I mean? Like, it's not political on or it's
[01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:24.900]  political, but it's not partisan. You know, it's, it's not right, right, left, right.
[01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:30.500]  You know what I mean? Like, I'm not here arguing about whether we should massively slash taxes
[01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:36.820]  on the rich, which is a partisan, you know, typical left, right argument, or should we
[01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:42.860]  get so many shades, so many shades to it. Yeah, yeah. But also, like, you know, there,
[01:42:42.860 --> 01:42:46.620]  there are people in one's own party, one does not particularly like or want to support,
[01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:49.620]  like, you know, should the party thing even matter that much? I mean, like, what are the
[01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:52.860]  people have to say? What are they doing? What are they accomplishing? You know, but if anything,
[01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:58.860]  we and I see this from the people that I follow on Max Temkins political US politics Twitter
[01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:03.300]  list, which has become a way bigger part of my life that I'd like to admit is that, you
[01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:09.980]  know, the thing is, you got to just not take your eye off the policies. That's the problem
[01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:14.380]  is that there are so many ways I you know, I don't say distract us or I'm not even making
[01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:17.980]  that dumb case that there's only one important thing and stop looking at Russia because this
[01:43:17.980 --> 01:43:24.280]  it's all important in its way. But like, it's, it's just so easy at this point to lose track
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:29.180]  of the policy stuff that's happening. And then as against as you say, what do we mean
[01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:34.540]  politics partisan, like, you know, and these these words that used to seem like we all
[01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:38.860]  kind of understood them a year or two ago, say two years ago, like, it means so many
[01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:45.140]  different things. Now, there's so many different tribes, it's even difficult. You know, conservative
[01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:51.340]  and liberal, progressive, like, what are the words even mean anymore? It's just red and
[01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:52.340]  tooth and claw.
[01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:57.660]  Yeah, I don't know. And the thing that depresses me a year in and that it's become more and
[01:43:57.660 --> 01:44:04.300]  more clear, I guess not. It's not like I wasn't aware of this beforehand, but it's become
[01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:09.180]  now that he's in office, and so much stuff just continues to get overlooked. It becomes
[01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:14.500]  so obvious to me that there is a contingent in the US a very sizable contingent that largely
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:21.020]  backed Trump, who sees their number one enemy as the people on the other side of the spectrum
[01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:26.080]  here in the US, that that's the enemy and if then and that the thing that keeps them
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:30.880]  in favor of Trump, like the 33%, who still give him a favorable rating, is that he keeps
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:35.420]  doing things to piss off liberals. And if he's pissing off liberals, whatever it is,
[01:44:35.420 --> 01:44:41.400]  it's good. And it to be it couldn't be more clear to me that that's true. And I find that
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:46.060]  incredibly just, you know, distressing. And literally, I mean, like for kids like us who
[01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:52.460]  grew up in the 70s and 80s, to have them see the Russians, well, the enemy of my enemy
[01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:56.960]  is my friend and my enemy is Hillary Clinton. So therefore the Russians are my friend, right
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:06.940]  is it's startling. It's absolutely, you know, it's not like, like, they're too young to
[01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:11.620]  remember who the Russians are. You know what I mean? Like, so I got a discussion the other
[01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:16.200]  day about somebody posted a thing on on Twitter, where there was a screenshot of a web app
[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:20.900]  that they were trying to run in Mozilla. And it said, your browser is not supported, please
[01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:26.380]  use this, you have to use this in Chrome. And the discussion on Twitter is more or less,
[01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:29.840]  how did we come around to this didn't, you know, like back around 2000, when everything
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:38.180]  was like, it only runs in IE. And we were like, like a groundswell movement to get like,
[01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:44.420]  the Mozilla project off the ground, and then WebKit after that, and to embrace web standards
[01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:49.260]  that all these, you know, to get developers on board with building using web standards
[01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:53.340]  to build everything so that nothing would be dependent on one single browser. And it
[01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:59.660]  worked right, it worked, we have it actually worked and broke the the lock that IE had
[01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:05.020]  on this. And it's like, we've circled around again. And now people are building things
[01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:08.420]  that only work in Chrome. And I think part of I think the explanation is that they're
[01:46:08.420 --> 01:46:13.180]  being built by people who are too young to remember 2000. Right? It's, you know, 22 year
[01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:16.940]  old developers who see these cool things that Chrome and Chrome only supports, and they're
[01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:25.220]  doing it because they were seven years old when when we were trying to break the IE word,
[01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:31.860]  how do you pronounce the word H-e-g-e-m-o-n-e-y-m-o-n-y? Oh, I'd usually say hegemony, hegemony, but
[01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:38.120]  I'm trying to break that to it. All right. But anyway, but this Russian thing, how can
[01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:44.540]  you forget who the Russians are? I mean, Vladimir Putin was literally a goddamn KGB agent. You
[01:46:44.540 --> 01:46:49.100]  know what I mean? I don't get it, except that the only way it makes sense is that whole
[01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:53.060]  enemy of the enemy enemy of my enemy is my friend. And Hillary Clinton is my enemy. Like,
[01:46:53.060 --> 01:46:58.140]  aren't you amazed at how many people continue to how much like you turn out if you browse
[01:46:58.140 --> 01:47:03.100]  through Fox News, how the news is about Hillary Clinton's corruption. And it's like, dude,
[01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:08.460]  that election literally, it's over a year ago. It is over a year ago. She lost. Yeah,
[01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:11.700]  she lost and she didn't dispute it. She should definitely be taken out of office at this
[01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:16.540]  point. Well, did you see the thing? I retweeted it. The Jimmy Kimmel show this week had a
[01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:20.340]  man on the street thing. And I sometimes roll my eyes at those man on the street things
[01:47:20.340 --> 01:47:25.020]  because if you shoot enough people, you're going to find somebody. They went out and
[01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:31.060]  on the streets of L.A. and we're asking people if they think Hillary Clinton should be impeached.
[01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:35.900]  And they found dozens and dozens of people who all said, oh, absolutely, absolutely.
[01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:40.380]  For the, you know, the crime she's committed and she's and it's and like the person says,
[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:43.220]  so you think impeachment is in order and they're like, yeah. And they were like, she should
[01:47:43.220 --> 01:47:46.900]  be removed from office. And they were like, yes, definitely. Well, you know, there's that
[01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:51.140]  old that old joke about the drunk wandering around into the street lamp. The cop comes
[01:47:51.140 --> 01:47:55.100]  up and says, what are you doing? He says, I'm looking for look for my glasses. And he
[01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:57.980]  says, where'd you lose them? Oh, they fell in the river yesterday. He says, what are
[01:47:57.980 --> 01:48:02.620]  you doing here? So the lights so much better over here. And, you know, I think I think
[01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:08.460]  in some ways what you're seeing is a a nation of people who can't even at this point, nobody
[01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:15.420]  can even anymore. And each side feels like to paraphrase Will Ferrell, it feels like
[01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:18.280]  you're taking crazy pills because you feel like you're seeing something that is so clear
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:21.740]  to you and you cannot believe that the other side sees it. So even if, even if she's not
[01:48:21.740 --> 01:48:25.520]  technically president and can't technically be impeached, isn't it obvious that she's
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:31.140]  a horrible person who needs to continue to suffer? Right. And I think I haven't thought
[01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:37.420]  this out very well, but I feel like there's part of this is that there's a war, a war,
[01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:43.100]  a battle, a fight. There's a fight going on right now to decide who's allowed to decide
[01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:48.400]  what's true and what their reasoning is for deciding that it's true. And maybe that's
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:53.140]  always been the case. It's just that it's an open war at this point. There's no, there's
[01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:59.220]  no longer any disputing that people have different ideas that are on both sides, probably a little
[01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:04.540]  bit irrational about how things are, why they're that way and what that means. And I, when
[01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:09.180]  you see something like what's going on day to day lately, it really feels like it's an
[01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:13.760]  attempt to redefine. And this is what makes it feel. I mean, I, I personally, I, I, I'm
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:17.860]  very resistant to going into the whole like Orwell thing or the whole like Mao thing or
[01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:22.140]  any of that. Cause it's, we should say that, keep that special. But on the other hand,
[01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:29.760]  people choosing to as a group decide that this empirically provably false thing is not
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:35.060]  only true, it's importantly true. That's the, you know, I'm saying like when, when everybody
[01:49:35.060 --> 01:49:41.740]  can look at this, at this same blue triangle and call it a, you know, a red rectangle by
[01:49:41.740 --> 01:49:47.100]  Fiat, that that's where to me it does get a little bit scary, but also where it makes
[01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:50.340]  me try to look at myself and say like, you know, what are the Hills that I decided to
[01:49:50.340 --> 01:49:54.460]  die on and didn't realize it. But it's a, it's a battle for what, for what is true and
[01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:59.660]  who's allowed to decide that, that I think is really salient right now. This is, this
[01:49:59.660 --> 01:50:03.200]  is the way, this is the way that we have, I'm not trying to name names or places here,
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:07.400]  but like, like, w well, you know, when you attack a Confederate statue, you're attacking
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:13.600]  my dad. When you, when you attack guns, you're attacking my grandfather. You're, you're attacking
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:16.480]  like, and whether that's true or not, I think that's very true. You and I've talked about
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:20.020]  baseball and family. There's these certain kinds of things that become, and we're not
[01:50:20.020 --> 01:50:22.880]  even getting into the whole, like, don't think of an elephant thing about the country as
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:27.120]  a family, but, but things start to feel like an attack on your family, even when they're
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:32.080]  not. The fact that solar energy exists, it feels like attack, an attack on your family.
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:35.480]  That sounds silly to you and me, but just somebody else, the solar energy might as well
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:39.880]  be Hillary Clinton with her uranium. Like it's, you're destroying my community. This
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:44.680]  is what this community does. You're destroying that. Like not only are like, well, I'm going
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:48.840]  to stop at this point for I get myself in trouble, but, but that, that the battle for,
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:54.660]  not simply what we decide is true, but who's allowed to decide that I think is a big part
[01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:59.560]  of what we're dealing with right now. And it's going to get worse before it gets better.
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:04.480]  And you, you mentioned before, and I kind of feel the same way where we had a sort of,
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:08.920]  we're going to, it's, this is F'd up and we don't know where it's going, but we're going
[01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:14.680]  to be okay. And I feel, I feel just as bad as you do about that. Take, it felt like we
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:19.920]  were just being positive on the day, but listening back, it didn't age well. No, I mean, anybody,
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:23.520]  anybody who's, whose parents just got removed from the country, like, guess what? It didn't
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:29.400]  work out for them. That was a real thing that happened. Yeah. Real people, you know, you
[01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:35.380]  know, and real people who are living in terror right now of what immigration and whatever
[01:51:35.380 --> 01:51:39.440]  ice stands for. Yeah. You know, I wrote on Derek fireball a couple of weeks ago that
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:43.040]  they're, they're literally a terrorist organization. I mean that sincerely. Well, there's certainly
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:46.840]  using terrorist means they're, they're fighting asymmetrically. The idea of going to a hospital
[01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:49.880]  or a church to try and find a child that you want to remove from the country is some very,
[01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:54.640]  very dark material and doing it in a way where they, they, they call the press, they they'll
[01:51:54.640 --> 01:52:01.120]  call the press to go and, and you know, so that the press is there to photograph and
[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:07.360]  publicize it, that if you go to a hospital or the big one was, you know, we had a couple
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:11.840]  of hurricanes this year that were not, you know, not good. And there was an announcement
[01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:16.520]  that, yeah, I forget if it was in Texas or Florida, but one of them, the sheriff made
[01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:23.280]  an announcement that, uh, that there'll be, there'll be, uh, immigration officers, uh,
[01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:28.520]  at the shelter, at the shelters. Yeah. Uh, w again. So the idea is you could feel like
[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:33.500]  that was in Florida. And then I feel like in Texas they expressly, we're trying to not
[01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:38.560]  say that. I think so. You're right. It was a local, it was on a local basis, I believe.
[01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:45.160]  Right. And again, I, it's just incomprehensible to me, you know, that, that you, what a shockingly
[01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:51.800]  inhumane and cruel thing to do. Like what a position to put somebody in, you know, like
[01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:56.000]  somebody who is undocumented and maybe, you know, even if it's just themselves and they're
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:00.000]  by themselves and they have to decide, do I, you know, I don't feel safe in my house,
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:03.960]  but I feel like I might get arrested if I go to the shelter that's, you know, uh, you
[01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:09.240]  know, a certified reinforced hurricane proof facility with, you know, medical professionals
[01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:16.080]  and stockpiles of water and basic provisions. Uh, what would it, it's sick. I don't know.
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:19.920]  I, you know, and again, that's not me. You know what I mean? Like, I don't have to worry
[01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:25.860]  about that. And that, that, that privilege absolutely, you know, fed me with more optimism
[01:53:25.860 --> 01:53:29.760]  than I should have had. And it's not, it's not right. And I feel, I feel guilty about
[01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:42.960]  it. I really do. I feel like we really brought the show, brought it to a happy place. We'll
[01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:46.480]  talk about one of your sponsors. You know, John, I gotta be honest with you, buddy. I
[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:51.080]  got to tell you, Christmas is coming up. Christmas is a hard time of year for me. I'm not a good
[01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:56.920]  shopper. I'm hard to shop for. Is there anything out there that can help me with this situation?
[01:53:56.920 --> 01:54:03.400]  Do you know anybody with bad wifi? Oh brother, do I ever, Oh, bane of my existence. You get
[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:08.480]  wifi that drops out. You, uh, you don't have any ability to test the speed. There's all
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:13.060]  kinds of ways. Doesn't, doesn't cover the whole house. I've had, I've had things like
[01:54:13.060 --> 01:54:19.240]  extenders and amplifiers, but it hasn't felt like it. Blanketed. Let me tell you in a mesh
[01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:25.240]  like way, my entire edifice in delicious wifi, hot, delicious steaming wifi. All right, let
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:31.200]  me tell you about Euro E E R O. Now, unlike a traditional router company that typically
[01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:37.280]  tries to the old style way of trying to saturate your house with wifi is to build bigger base
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:44.600]  stations and try to pump more wifi raised through the house from a base station. Eero
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:48.760]  takes a totally, totally different strategy. Eero creates a mesh network where you have
[01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:54.640]  multiple multiple devices that you spread throughout your house. Uh, you don't have
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:59.520]  to have a special base station one, the same one that serves as your main one. You set
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:03.760]  it up, it have a little app. It's a brilliantly written, simple iPhone app. You put it on
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:08.740]  your iPhone. Let me talk about that app. Uh, and it just says, okay, this one, you give
[01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:12.420]  it a name like maybe, maybe your cable connections in your living room. You can just say living
[01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:17.200]  room, my house, the main connections in my office. So it says office and then you connect
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:22.460]  other ones throughout your house. The app will give you instructions on where best to
[01:55:22.460 --> 01:55:27.920]  place them. Like to, if you can put them near the stairways so that there's less fewer walls
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:32.820]  interfering, that's even better. But the apple guides you through it and you carried a couple
[01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:36.400]  of them and you don't connect to the thing you have to keep in mind. It was, let's say
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:40.360]  you have three of them. You have three of them in your house. You don't have three wifi
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:43.600]  networks, so it's not like you've created some kind of thing where now you have three
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:47.520]  wifi networks and depending on where you have, you're in your house, you're connected to
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:52.460]  network A, B or C. It's just one network. Your devices only see one network. When you
[01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:57.120]  go to your wifi menu and the menu bar, it only shows up as one network, but the device,
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:00.640]  this is the way the mesh network connects. It'll connect intelligently to the one that
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:04.560]  with the strongest signal and it really just works. It, you don't have, you don't have
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:08.620]  to have like a networking, uh, engineering certificate to set this up. You just plug
[01:56:08.620 --> 01:56:15.760]  them in. The app takes care of it and they've got a new second generation hardware that,
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:20.200]  that they came out with, I think just a couple of months ago. But the, the second generation
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:25.920]  hardware has a third five gigahertz radio. And so now it's tri band and that makes it
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:32.360]  twice as fast as its predecessor, the generation one Euro and the generation one Euro was plenty
[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:39.020]  fast, fastest wifi I've ever had in the house. Um, uh, so double the speed on something that
[01:56:39.020 --> 01:56:44.920]  was already fast is just terrific. And they've added these things called Euro beacons. So
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:50.160]  instead of having the full, I got the beacons, the beacons are brilliant. They're just little
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:56.600]  things. You don't even have like a power cable. They just plug into the wall like a nightlight.
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:57:00.400]  And in fact you can just, I just, I always imagined the meeting where they were like,
[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:05.360]  well, we could just plug it into the wall like a nightlight and somebody in, in at the,
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:08.800]  at the table. Henderson, Henderson shoots up and he says, wait a minute, what if we
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:15.440]  made it a light nightlight? Thanks Henderson. Totally works. I never fall down going to
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:19.960]  the bathroom anymore. It's really nice, right? So you can set it up and it can be a little
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:23.960]  nightlight and if you don't like that, you can use the app and say, turn on, turn the
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:28.360]  light off. Uh, so you don't, you don't have to use it as a nightlight, but if you want
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:33.280]  to, it's there thanks to Henderson. Uh, and so you have these smaller things that they're
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:37.840]  so inconspicuous and you can fit them anywhere because you don't have to plug it in and run
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:42.000]  a cable. It's, it's like if you just have an outlet at like the side of the stairs or
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:46.680]  something like that, it might be the perfect location. You just plug it in and the, the
[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:53.040]  beacons act as part of the mesh network to just saturate your home with really strong,
[01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:59.880]  thorough wifi service. Um, it, it's really great and a brilliant little devices. Just
[01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:04.040]  go to the website and take a look at them. Honest to God, I, I would call them Apple
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:08.920]  esque in design. They're sort of like a little white version of an Apple TV with, you know,
[01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:15.400]  nice round corners, uh, very inconspicuous, really, really about as, as nice of a, if
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:18.760]  you can make a router look nice, that Euro is it? Can I, can I, can I say a word? Can
[01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:22.720]  I say a word about the app? Absolutely. Cause I'm a fan. Go look at your, uh, their texts.
[01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:27.080]  Go look at that. So one thing you can do that's really, really cool. And there, there are
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:32.060]  whole other products and services that you can pick up that just do this one thing that
[01:58:32.060 --> 01:58:36.520]  era already does, which is it will show you every device on your network. And if you're
[01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:43.440]  a weirdo like me, you can go in, you can name all of your devices, whatever you want, and
[01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:48.480]  you can give them emoji. So all of my, all of my Apple or all of my TV pucks naturally
[01:58:48.480 --> 01:58:52.960]  have a hockey icon. You got, you got max, you got the Amazon one, you got my Kindle
[01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:56.800]  oasis is a little, is a little book. Okay. That's cool enough on its own. Now what's
[01:58:56.800 --> 01:59:00.680]  nice is it will show you what is on your network right now. What has recently been on your
[01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:04.480]  network? Why is this useful? If there's something weird on the air that you don't recognize,
[01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:08.020]  you can block it. If you think that somebody is glomming onto your network in a weird way,
[01:59:08.020 --> 01:59:11.600]  you can just, you can just block it. And if it is currently connected to your network,
[01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:16.620]  it will show you it at that moment, how much bandwidth that device is, is, uh, downloading
[01:59:16.620 --> 01:59:21.800]  and uploading. It's so great. Yeah. And if you happen to have a problem, you can even
[01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:25.880]  look at it and it'll tell you which base station it's connected to. Have you done profiles
[01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:30.760]  yet? Uh, I don't think so. What's the profile? There's a whole, you can go out and buy products
[01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:35.760]  for this. You can have profiles. So you create a profile called, uh, for the sake of argument,
[01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:40.920]  teenage son and the teenage son profile has certain kinds of devices on it and then certain
[01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:44.360]  kinds of rules about when it's allowed to be used. So if you've got yourself some little
[01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:48.360]  scamp that likes to dash off with the Chromebook and sit in a closet like an animal, you know
[01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:52.360]  what, maybe their wifi gets a, it goes away a little bit about nine o'clock. You can do
[01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:56.120]  that. That is built in. You have, you can have some things you have, you have absolute
[01:59:56.120 --> 02:00:00.240]  control. This is the MCP. That's what I'm saying. I really liked this. I liked it. I
[02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:03.560]  like your emoji. He sent this screenshot. He's got a, he's got a book, a book emoji
[02:00:03.560 --> 02:00:08.600]  for his Kindle. He's got a, uh, the scales of justice for the whittings scale. This is
[02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:12.240]  really actually, I thought that I was like looking at this an entire Friday night doing
[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:16.220]  this. I was looking at, I was like, wow, my Euro app doesn't do this. I didn't realize
[02:00:16.220 --> 02:00:19.840]  that you did the work, but it is a great feature. You can see all the devices on the network
[02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:23.720]  or one of the other little things that I love about this. And I know that other base stations
[02:00:23.720 --> 02:00:27.440]  have this feature. I know it. I know it's not unique to Euro, but Euro makes it so easy
[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:32.640]  to set up. It's so easy to set up a guest network because I'll tell you what, I'm a
[02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:35.960]  weirdo. You know what I have even when like when friends come over, but especially when
[02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:40.920]  it's just like people who are like lowercase F friends, uh, they want to get on a wifi.
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:44.680]  I don't like letting them on the real wifi, especially if they didn't bring anything.
[02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:47.640]  You know, if they didn't like bring, bring beer or casserole or something like, why are
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:51.920]  you going to give them the password? I don't think so. Get on the guest network. We had
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:56.840]  somebody on the, we had somebody at the house, uh, a family distant family member was in
[02:00:56.840 --> 02:01:02.880]  and wanted to get on the wifi. Uh, and I had an Android phone and I just, uh, I just thought,
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:06.480]  eh, who knows what the hell's running on there? And I can old Android phone and it's like,
[02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:10.760]  you know what? Put them on the guest network. Isolated. So good. This is a good product.
[02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:15.120]  Good product, John. You know what? Fantastic gift, you know? Exactly. So if you've got
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:18.520]  like a family member, I'm telling you, you got like your parents have some rickety old
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:23.200]  wifi network, buy them an era set up and set it up for him at Christmas. It'll be so easy.
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:27.920]  I swear you'd be done in five minutes. It's so great. So like for example, I'm just saying
[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:32.320]  if you have an Euro already and you know how good it is, not a bad gift idea for the people
[02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:37.080]  in your family who could use something like this. And I will tell you this also with firsthand
[02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:42.960]  experience. If you have the first generation Euro buying second generation Euro material,
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:47.580]  you don't have to like start over from scratch. You can just sort of add the second generation
[02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:51.060]  hardware to your network and you still get some of the better for performance and stuff
[02:01:51.060 --> 02:01:58.840]  like that. Cool. It's really, really great. Um, where do you go to find out more? You
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:04.840]  go to Euro.com and you get free overnight shipping in the U S and Canada. I'm sorry
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:09.360]  if you live elsewhere, but it's free overnight shipping in the U S and Canada at Euro.com.
[02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:15.800]  Uh, when you enter the promo code, the talk show, so you got to go, uh, you got to use
[02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:19.560]  that promo code to get the free shipping in U S or Canada. It's at Euro.com. You'll find
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:25.320]  out more. Um, they've got some great basic, the website will help you decide just based
[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:29.140]  on the size of the house or apartment you're buying for what to buy and how many units
[02:02:29.140 --> 02:02:33.160]  and stuff like that. You don't need me to tell you that. So just go to Euro.com and
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:37.440]  remember that code, the talk show for free shipping in the U S and Canada. There you
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:40.280]  go. Christmas is all set. Merry Christmas everybody.
[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:41.280]  Hmm.
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:50.200]  All right. What else do we got here? Oh, let's do something short and happy. How many more
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:54.840]  sponsors you got? Uh, that's it. Let's do something fun and happy. We can talk about
[02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:58.680]  your sandwich. We could talk about here. I'll tell you this before we move off for politics.
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:02.800]  You have an item here on our suggested ideas about predict it.org and you wrote, here's
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:07.280]  what Marlin wrote in the show notes. Predict it.org ever tried gambling on stuff like politics
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:12.760]  and so predict it.org is a site where you can put real money in there and bet on things
[02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:17.000]  like who's going to win an election or something like that. I lost a lot of money on predicted
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:18.000]  out of org last year.
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:22.120]  Oh, you did. Were you listening to the starly kind, David Reese or not? I'm sorry. No, no,
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:27.600]  the other one, the one with David and the other fellow. Were you listening to the, uh,
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:32.440]  where they were doing predicted on a podcast? Uh, no, I was just making my own gut feelings,
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:37.540]  but I forget how much money I put in to start contracts. They call them contracts. Which
[02:03:37.540 --> 02:03:41.880]  ones were you attracted to? Were you into the really like weird, like flipping a coin
[02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:45.360]  at the super bowl type ones, reading the margins, what kind of stuff? You can just straight
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:51.480]  up candidates. Yeah, straight up candidates. And I bet, I forget how many hundreds of dollars
[02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:56.480]  I put in there. Don't say, Oh, don't say, Oh, but I ran it up. I ran up like a couple
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:02.480]  of hundred dollars to start up to well over a thousand because I bet heavily against Ted
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:08.040]  Cruz. I bet I, I, I, the only one I lost a little bit on is I bet some money on Marco
[02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:16.040]  Rubio early. Uh, but the big one was I early on in the Republican primary, I, Trump was
[02:04:16.040 --> 02:04:21.000]  selling it around the way that the site works is, is you'll get like a number from zero
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:26.520]  to a hundred, but typically it's from one to 99. And so for example, let's say if you
[02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:34.520]  bet on, um, um, Hillary Clinton getting the democratic nomination and it costs you 68
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:39.440]  cents when if she wins, you get paid a dollar for every one of those shares that you, it's
[02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:43.960]  like a stock market type thing. So you paid 68 cents a share for it on the pay on the
[02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:48.320]  presumption that she, at that point she had a 68% chance of winning. If on election day
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:53.020]  she wins, you get paid a hundred, you get paid a dollar for the 68 cents share you bought.
[02:04:53.020 --> 02:04:58.840]  So I bought Trump at like 18, 19% and I bought a lot of it because I could, it was, I got
[02:04:58.840 --> 02:05:03.280]  a point where like I sold my Marco Rubio at like a small loss. I was like, you know what?
[02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:05.960]  Trump's going to beat all these guys. I could see it. It was like, I know how to drink a
[02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:12.440]  bottle of water. It's like I just saw it. I was on board with the Trump is never going
[02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:16.980]  to saw it. You saw it coming. Yeah, I really are. At least saw it as way higher in odds
[02:05:16.980 --> 02:05:22.520]  than 18%. Right. And so I bought, I don't know, like 500 shares at five or 600 shares
[02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:28.900]  of Trump at 18%. And it eventually became worth, you know, I held onto it till the very
[02:05:28.900 --> 02:05:34.040]  end and, and you know, got paid a dollar for every one of them. And I also bought a ton
[02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:39.720]  of Hillary Clinton at likes to beat Bernie Sanders at like 62%. And I thought that it
[02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:43.680]  was crazy. I thought this was like, I was like, I should like, I should like sell my
[02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:47.000]  stock and put all my money in this and I still feel that way. I felt like Hillary, I felt
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:50.040]  like the only way Hillary Clinton wasn't going to beat Bernie Sanders was if she had like
[02:05:50.040 --> 02:05:54.180]  a heart attack or something, you know, like if, you know, something medical or happened
[02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:58.880]  to her plane crash or something like that, where there was a point where, and it wasn't
[02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:03.560]  just my opinion. It wasn't like, I think Hillary Clinton should beat him. I like, you know,
[02:06:03.560 --> 02:06:07.880]  also the brain prions that she got from eating children at the pizza parlor. No, I'm talking
[02:06:07.880 --> 02:06:12.640]  about like, just like the math of like, you know, that she had already won certain primaries
[02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:17.400]  and that it wasn't like before the New Hampshire primary, it was like, you know, one third
[02:06:17.400 --> 02:06:22.180]  into primary season and you could still get shares of Hillary Clinton at like 68, 69%
[02:06:22.180 --> 02:06:26.720]  when the math was there, that there's no way for him to outperform that there was no way
[02:06:26.720 --> 02:06:32.240]  that he could win, you know, mathematically. And I know that this upsets Bernie. It upset
[02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:37.200]  Bernie supporters tremendously, like last March, April, when you would tell them that
[02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:41.640]  because they were, they were saying, I would prefer Bernie to win. And you would say, well,
[02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:45.580]  it doesn't matter. Mathematically, he can't win. And then they would say, but I want Bernie
[02:06:45.580 --> 02:06:53.960]  to win. Yeah. And it, you know, if you were talking it across purposes, they're cool.
[02:06:53.960 --> 02:06:58.480]  I have an analogy. Ben Thompson and I have brought this up that I think, uh, I really
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:03.680]  do believe this. If I could commission a poll, I believe, I know that they, they call it
[02:07:03.680 --> 02:07:07.680]  sports ball. There's a lot of people who don't like sports. And when people start talking
[02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:12.240]  about sports, that their eyes go back into it. I believe that there was a correlation,
[02:07:12.240 --> 02:07:16.920]  a very strong correlation. Obviously there are exceptions on both sides, many exceptions,
[02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:22.660]  but I think there was a strong correlation that Democrats who are sports fans supported
[02:07:22.660 --> 02:07:28.400]  Hillary Clinton and Democrats who don't like sports and don't pay attention to sports support.
[02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:34.420]  That's super interesting. I never thought of that. Hmm. Right. And there is a, in sports,
[02:07:34.420 --> 02:07:43.120]  there is a, it, you, you can't really get, uh, uh, uh, what's the opposite of pragmatic
[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:49.400]  idealistic. You can't let your ideals take advantage of you. Like, let's say, uh, especially
[02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:53.800]  if you're betting, right? Well, let's just say you're coaching. Let's say that idealistically
[02:07:53.800 --> 02:07:57.880]  you think a starting pitcher should pitch at least five innings and you're starting
[02:07:57.880 --> 02:08:02.420]  pitcher is out there in the second inning and you're already behind 12 nothing, right?
[02:08:02.420 --> 02:08:06.040]  You gotta, you gotta go out there and take them out and replace them. You know, you're,
[02:08:06.040 --> 02:08:13.320]  you're getting killed, you know, right. You, you know, I, I, this is just a loose thing
[02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:17.800]  and I really do feel that part of that was that the idealism, like Bernie Sanders supporters
[02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:21.360]  were far more idealistic than Hillary Clinton supporters. Whereas Hillary Clinton supporters
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:24.900]  were pragmatic and like, we should end this because the most important thing is making
[02:08:24.900 --> 02:08:29.480]  sure that, you know, either Bernie, whoever wins, wins the election. But at this point,
[02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:33.840]  Hillary is going to win. And so this is self-destructive to, to keep fighting this. In other words,
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:37.440]  if it, if the case has been otherwise that they might've said the same thing except with
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:42.160]  Bernie taking over. Right. And so I can imagine like, so football is a good example. So imagine
[02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:49.720]  in a football game, there's a three minutes left to play and the one team is up by a 35
[02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:53.400]  points where they're not going to win. And so it's, it's really in everybody's interest
[02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:57.120]  and in the interest of sportsmanship for, you know, just, just don't play it, you know,
[02:08:57.120 --> 02:09:00.680]  take a knee and let the clock run out. The Bernie Sanders people are like, well, my,
[02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:03.920]  I want to win so bad. I'm going to keep trying to tackle the other team. Yeah. Maybe I'll
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:08.240]  get a super touchdown. Right. Maybe I'll get even thinking things like injury, like avoiding
[02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:10.840]  injury, like the kind of stuff where you go like, boy, wouldn't it suck if we were up
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:15.240]  by 35 and our quarterback got a concussion? Right. So anyway, I made money betting on
[02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:18.680]  Hillary Clinton at a point I put, you know, several hundred dollars in it at a point where
[02:09:18.680 --> 02:09:22.000]  I felt like Mathem at, you know, I was really just betting that she wasn't going to die
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:28.120]  before the primary election. I honestly believe that. I really do think that you could just
[02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:34.220]  tally up the, the, you know, the, what do you call them? Delegates. Yeah, I think there
[02:09:34.220 --> 02:09:37.420]  might've been. So anyway, I ran up, I've made a ton of money on the primaries by betting
[02:09:37.420 --> 02:09:42.800]  on Trump, by betting against Ted Cruz, uh, and betting on Hillary Clinton. So I turned
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:47.920]  like a couple hundred bucks into like, I dunno, 1500 bucks or something like that. And I just
[02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:55.640]  let it all, I let it all ride on Hillary winning the general election. So I wound up with nothing
[02:09:55.640 --> 02:10:03.000]  like literally turned like 15 or $1,600 into zero. That's how it goes, huh? No, that's
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:08.360]  just my money. I think I started with like three or $400 and quadrupled it in the primaries
[02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:15.960]  with those bets. Oh, did that give you confidence? Confidence? What the winning of the primaries?
[02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:20.600]  It felt like you kind of like, like I didn't feel like start getting some winning hands.
[02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:27.480]  I felt like you were hot. Yeah. And I, I did feel I, I, you know, we talked about it a
[02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:31.840]  year ago. I don't, I wouldn't say that I felt like Hillary was a lock to win the general
[02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:35.740]  in the way that I felt she was a lock to beat Bernie Sanders in the primary. When I made
[02:10:35.740 --> 02:10:40.040]  that bet, I realized that it wasn't quite as much of a lock, but it felt like a pretty
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:47.400]  sure thing. Hmm. I learned about this from that podcast. It's so interesting to me that
[02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:53.880]  you actually did do this. That's hilarious. The other thing is though, that sometimes
[02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:59.140]  when people are talking about what's going to happen with this, um, election or what's
[02:10:59.140 --> 02:11:02.760]  going to happen with whatever this thing is that feels really up in the air could go either
[02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:06.980]  way, even if it's predicting who the next doctor is going to be, right? Who the BBC
[02:11:06.980 --> 02:11:10.700]  picks to be the next. It's very interesting to go, especially in England. There's a lot
[02:11:10.700 --> 02:11:15.120]  of betting markets for these things. It's sometimes at least interesting to compare
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:20.360]  what the betting markets say versus what the polls say. Cause the betting markets are,
[02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:25.920]  I mean there's all kinds of reasons for the market to make that as close to what we really
[02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:29.900]  know is going to happen as possible. Do you know what I mean? Yep. And it's, you'll see
[02:11:29.900 --> 02:11:33.180]  that really in the last, I guess maybe it's always existed, but I feel like really in
[02:11:33.180 --> 02:11:36.280]  the run up to the election more and more you would hear people saying like, well, this
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:43.440]  is what they're saying over in this giving, given a betting market. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah,
[02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:47.040]  I agree with that and I think that those things are interesting. It was actually Paul Krugman
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:51.520]  who turned me onto these betting markets a while ago as being a very accurate from his
[02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:55.480]  cab driver, I believe. Yeah, I think so. No, you're thinking of freedom. Oh, sorry. Blew
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:12:04.180]  it. Damn it. Friedman learns things from his cab drivers. Which one's Krugman? Uh, Krugman's
[02:12:04.180 --> 02:12:11.280]  the bearded guy with the economics degree. He's a Nobel prize winning. Oh, Friedman versus
[02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:16.080]  Krugman. Yeah. I always knew those are two different guys. I knew that. Yeah. Uh, but
[02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:19.740]  yeah, I think that they are an accurate gauge of, of the odds of an election. The thing
[02:12:19.740 --> 02:12:24.000]  that I, the other thing, mathematical thing I found frustrating with last year's election
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:30.560]  was the, uh, in the aftermath, the sort of see Nate silver is a fucking idiot reaction.
[02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:36.120]  That was also Nate silver. I forget what he placed on the eve of election day. I forget
[02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:40.160]  where he placed the odds, but let's just say for the sake of argument that he gave Hillary
[02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:44.900]  Clinton an 80% chance of winning, which I think was around where silver had been so
[02:12:44.900 --> 02:12:50.760]  criticized for not being yay, rah, rah, Hillary enough in the run up. Right, right. And that
[02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:54.640]  there were other people who were putting it way more like in the 90 some percentile that
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:13:00.120]  she would win. But let's say Nate silver says 80% chance that she will win. Very likely.
[02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:06.440]  And it turned out she didn't. Well, and then there were some on the, on the, on the Trump
[02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:09.940]  side who gleefully said, see, silver's an idiot. He doesn't know what the fuck he's
[02:13:09.940 --> 02:13:13.880]  talking about. These polls are all bullshit. But if you say something has understand how
[02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:18.600]  probability works, right? Don't, didn't you ever play a dice game? I mean, there's still
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:22.160]  10 chances out of a hundred. There's still one chance out of 10 that it'll be this way.
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:28.000]  And that chance resets every single time. That's what makes it a probability, right?
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:33.200]  Like if you play a dice game where a snake eyes is a loser, it only happens once out
[02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:39.720]  of every 36 rolls, but it happens. You know what I mean? So if you, if you say it's a
[02:13:39.720 --> 02:13:43.760]  one out of five chance of happening, that's actually terrifying. So like in other words,
[02:13:43.760 --> 02:13:47.520]  if we like three years from now, if we're on the eve of, and Trump somehow manages to
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:53.320]  still be an office and he's on the eve of his reelection thing and Nate silver tells
[02:13:53.320 --> 02:13:59.240]  me that there is a 98% chance that whoever's running against Trump is going to win. I am
[02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:03.240]  not going to sleep the night before cause I'm thinking one out of 50. Oh my God, that
[02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:10.800]  is too much. It's way too much running. It's cyber Hillary, right? Like imagine if somebody
[02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:15.600]  told you, you have a one in 50 chance of dying today. Oh, a hundred percent. Like this is,
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:20.260]  there's God, there's so much scholarship research about this, about how terrible human beings
[02:14:20.260 --> 02:14:25.560]  are at estimating things based on things like this that like we, we cause like, you know,
[02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:29.120]  and also then there's the whole difference of like, how likely is this to happen versus
[02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:34.480]  how confident are we in our bed? Do you know what I mean? And we take it all to kind of
[02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:39.240]  be the same number, which is like 90% shit. That's almost a hundred percent. That's totally
[02:14:39.240 --> 02:14:46.120]  going to happen. And you're like, no, no, that's not really what that means at all.
[02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:51.680]  It's absolutely terrifying. So like that 80% cyber Hillary, right? It was actually, he
[02:14:51.680 --> 02:14:57.000]  was, it was actually a feather in silver's cap in my opinion that he pegged Trump's odds
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:02.400]  is it's still a long shot or an underdog. Maybe the long shot is too strong a word,
[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:07.080]  but an underdog, a strong underdog to win the election, but had it as way more plausible
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:14.000]  than most other people. And the way that he won with such a narrow margin of victory in
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:19.400]  Pennsylvania, Wisconsin. And what was the third on Michigan? I think actually like it
[02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:24.680]  was like, yeah, that actually seems like a, like the way that a, a, a, an underdog could
[02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:25.680]  squeak through.
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:31.400]  Yeah. And then in the model, that's exactly what could happen. And it's what did happen,
[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:34.320]  right? I think it's probably still counting votes in that. Remember that one little county
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:39.680]  in Michigan. Remember, wait, wait, wait. Hang on just a moment, please. We still have not
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:44.560]  heard back. There may be a box somewhere in Southern Michigan that changes the entire
[02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:46.560]  evening. You're in the situation.
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:52.240]  What else do you want to talk about? You want to talk to your Apple pay two hours and 20
[02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:56.680]  minutes, dude. What are you doing? All right. That's good. Well, you know, I know you like
[02:15:56.680 --> 02:16:01.640]  the ones where I prepare. So I added a few things. What about this? What about this to
[02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:05.500]  wrap up? What about this? You know, since it is our Thanksgiving holiday spectacular,
[02:16:05.500 --> 02:16:10.240]  about just what we're thankful for right now. Hmm. Is that too corny? I should have thought
[02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:15.200]  about that. What am I really thankful for? You know, I'm thankful that I'm not incredibly
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:21.880]  ill right now. I'm thankful that my family is so tolerant of me by and large. Um, I don't
[02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:32.600]  know. Uh, are you reading my list? It was the best Thanksgiving ever. What's on yours?
[02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:41.360]  I am. I am. It is. I don't know how much, I don't know how much worse or how much stronger
[02:16:41.360 --> 02:16:47.820]  the sentiment gets the older you get. But I, at the age of 44, I'm so incredibly thankful
[02:16:47.820 --> 02:16:52.560]  for my health, which is something that I've lived my, you know, my entire life I've avoided
[02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:58.280]  any kind of really serious health ailments. You know, my eye thing, get your hand thing
[02:16:58.280 --> 02:17:03.360]  in your eye thing. Those are just an injury. You know what I mean? Like, and I fully recovered,
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:07.880]  you know, the hand thing I fully recovered from, you know, boy, that's it. But you see
[02:17:07.880 --> 02:17:11.840]  people, it's like, you know, I, you know, I live in the city just like you and it's
[02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:14.000]  like, you know, what do you do when you're walking around the city? Well, I listen to
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:17.640]  podcasts and I look at people and I like to watch interesting people. I'll tell you what,
[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:21.960]  I walked by a restaurant yesterday, really nice restaurant. Um, at the, in the base,
[02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:26.680]  it's actually in the base of the Comcast building. Nice. Yeah. Right there at cable town. It's
[02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:31.840]  a place called chops. I guess it's a steakhouse. I've never been there, but uh, it's, you know,
[02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:35.520]  it's after school. I'm walking the kiddo from school, so it's like 20 after three. Uh, so
[02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:38.760]  there, you know, there's nobody in there yet. I don't know when happy hour opens there,
[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:41.960]  but I'm guessing, you know, after four or something. And there's a guy who's obviously
[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:46.360]  a manager wearing a nice suit and he's at the bar and there's a bartender behind the
[02:17:46.360 --> 02:17:52.120]  bar and the bartender hands him some kind of like a placemat and I'm like, I wonder
[02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:57.120]  what's going on there. I'm walking right by the window and the manager takes it and holds
[02:17:57.120 --> 02:18:01.640]  it right up to his face and takes a big sniff. And I realized that they're going through
[02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:06.700]  some sort of, we have smelly placemats thing. Oh, interesting. Like I told myself an entire
[02:18:06.700 --> 02:18:11.220]  story about what's going on in there where the manager had just gone around and was looking
[02:18:11.220 --> 02:18:16.160]  at the place before it opened up and then had had read the bartender, the riot act about
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:21.600]  not sufficiently, you know, hosing down these, these placemats, you know, and now he's testing
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:26.800]  one sniffing it and it just looked like such a weirdo and he clearly had no idea, you know,
[02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:29.720]  wasn't thinking about the fact that anybody walking by could see it. But anyway, that's
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:35.300]  what I do. I look at people and you, you know, watch long enough and you see people with,
[02:18:35.300 --> 02:18:39.600]  you know, who obviously are struggling with their health and I think, oh my God, that's
[02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:44.280]  thank God I don't have to do that for now or right now for now. Yeah. Yeah. I'll say
[02:18:44.280 --> 02:18:50.000]  what I'm thankful for. I'm thankful for, um, my parents are in good health and my dad is,
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:57.520]  uh, my dad's turning 80 in December. Wow. Uh, my brother-in-law and I took him, uh,
[02:18:57.520 --> 02:19:00.960]  not last weekend, but the weekend before we actually took him. My dad liked me as a Dallas
[02:19:00.960 --> 02:19:05.900]  Cowboys fan and we, uh, he's always wanted to see a Dallas Cowboys game at Dallas. Never
[02:19:05.900 --> 02:19:09.880]  been there. So my brother and I took him to Dallas for a long weekend. That's nice. That's
[02:19:09.880 --> 02:19:14.680]  really nice. But he's 80 years old. He, you know, he's in terrific health. You know, you'd
[02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:18.440]  never, I think if you saw him, you'd never ever, I don't know. I think you'd guess 70
[02:19:18.440 --> 02:19:22.280]  maybe, honestly, maybe even younger. I mean, he plays golf almost every day when the weather
[02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:28.400]  permits and walks, walks the course, uh, doesn't ride around in a cart. Like some people, like
[02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:37.280]  some people, um, he doesn't get winded walking up a hill in Europe. Right? Exactly. The sniffing
[02:19:37.280 --> 02:19:45.240]  is back. Where's my golf cart? Um, my dad's 80 years old and could go out and eat steak
[02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:49.600]  and drink beer with my brother-in-law and me and go to a Cowboys game. And, and you
[02:19:49.600 --> 02:19:53.920]  know, my dad is very gregarious and outgoing. And so we, you know, we get to this football
[02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:59.040]  game. Uh, I think local time it was a three 30 kickoff in Dallas and you know, we got
[02:19:59.040 --> 02:20:05.120]  there to the, the, the tailgating area around two or something like that. Um, and my dad
[02:20:05.120 --> 02:20:11.740]  made like 50 friends in the, oh, I love somebody like that. That's the type you don't meet
[02:20:11.740 --> 02:20:18.160]  as much anymore. The garrulous guy, like the get along guy, get along guy. And uh, it was
[02:20:18.160 --> 02:20:21.880]  just had a great time. And I just think like, you know, how many people out there, you know,
[02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:25.800]  uh, you know, I know, you know, firsthand, I know so many, you know, what, what a privilege
[02:20:25.800 --> 02:20:29.840]  it is that at 80, you know, me at 44 and my dad at 80 that we could still do something
[02:20:29.840 --> 02:20:35.560]  like that. Very thankful. I truly am. There's no, there's no explanation. Cowboys win. The
[02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:42.040]  Cowboys did win. Cowboys did win. It turned out all right. Yeah, it turned out all right.
[02:20:42.040 --> 02:20:45.280]  I'll tell you what was nice too. I tell you, I appreciate this as a Philadelphia fan. The
[02:20:45.280 --> 02:20:48.040]  other thing that was nice is they were playing the Kansas city chiefs and Kansas city is
[02:20:48.040 --> 02:20:52.360]  about 500 miles away from Dallas and there were plenty of Kansas city fans there. I don't
[02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:56.740]  know if it was 20% of the people, but somewhere between 10 to 20% of the people that were
[02:20:56.740 --> 02:21:01.320]  were in Kansas city stuff and it, everything in the parking lot and in the stadium and
[02:21:01.320 --> 02:21:06.200]  everything was all in good fun and good spirits. That's nice. Yeah. Oh, that is, that is, that
[02:21:06.200 --> 02:21:12.120]  is so nice. I mean that, that would not happen in Philadelphia. Don't you guys throw batteries
[02:21:12.120 --> 02:21:15.480]  at people? Isn't that kind of your jam? They used to know they used to throw batteries,
[02:21:15.480 --> 02:21:21.040]  but they don't. That, that's, that was a long time ago. No, they throw coupons for Uber.
[02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:26.320]  No, they've calmed things down. I think what's happened is that the ticket prices have gone
[02:21:26.320 --> 02:21:31.080]  up so much that it's priced the, you can afford to throw batteries. Be too costly. Yeah, you
[02:21:31.080 --> 02:21:37.520]  know, and it's just sort of priced that crowd out of it. Like the battery people, right?
[02:21:37.520 --> 02:21:41.520]  The sort of sociopathic hooligan crowd who thinks, let's go to, let's go to an Eagles
[02:21:41.520 --> 02:21:47.040]  game. We can throw batteries at strangers. I remember, I feel like there were some white
[02:21:47.040 --> 02:21:52.000]  knuckle moments for the reds at certain times. Pete, Pete, Pete Rose might be over on the
[02:21:52.000 --> 02:22:02.960]  hot corner and take a nine volt to the back of the neck. Oh, anything else? No. Mary happy
[02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:08.120]  thanks giving time. Yeah. Likewise to you. I mean, you know, and to everybody back in
[02:22:08.120 --> 02:22:12.240]  a year and uh, you know, see where things are. Do you think, do you think Trump is going
[02:22:12.240 --> 02:22:15.600]  to be in office in a year? You think when we do our, our Thanksgiving spectacular? No,
[02:22:15.600 --> 02:22:22.640]  I, you know, I got this bet wrong before. All right. But let's see what predicted says,
[02:22:22.640 --> 02:22:28.280]  you know, it's, it's, it's an overused quote, but it's so true. Is that Hemingway line about
[02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:35.200]  how did you go bankrupt? And it was a slowly. Oh, so slowly at first. Right, right. And
[02:22:35.200 --> 02:22:41.920]  then, and I feel like that's how, that's how this, you know, he will quit as soon as it
[02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:46.520]  is really obvious to him. There's no way that he would like go down. Don't you think? I
[02:22:46.520 --> 02:22:50.200]  don't think. No, he'd say, I got a TV show. I got a better deal. I won the deal. Yeah.
[02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:54.080]  Okay. So here's what we got. Um, and this is, this is just science. This is not politics.
[02:22:54.080 --> 02:23:01.080]  This is science. Um, will Trump be president at year end 2017 the current market is 95%
[02:23:01.080 --> 02:23:05.840]  yes, 5% now. I mean for a variety of reasons that makes a lot of sense with no change.
[02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:10.640]  It's not a very active, but it is the one that a lot of people have bet on, you know,
[02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:15.760]  five. That's actually crazy. If you think about it, that's still, you know, middle.
[02:23:15.760 --> 02:23:22.120]  So we've got six weeks to go in the year that, that you can get 5% odds that some dynamic
[02:23:22.120 --> 02:23:25.700]  you can buy and sell anytime you want. Now let's look at who down a little bit. Will
[02:23:25.700 --> 02:23:35.840]  Trump be president at year end 2018? Uh, yes. At 68 cents. No, at 32 cents. Hmm. I think
[02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:41.040]  I've got to get back into this cause money be made in here. My friend, 2020 presidential
[02:23:41.040 --> 02:23:49.160]  winner. You can buy, you can buy no on Trump for 65 cents. Boy, that's 65 cents to buy
[02:23:49.160 --> 02:23:56.120]  a no. Wow. That seems like good. That seems like a good bet. I got to get back. We've
[02:23:56.120 --> 02:23:59.000]  got to end this show. I gotta, I gotta get over, get to predict it. Thanks for having
[02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:04.920]  me on buddy. Merlin. I, it's always, always a pleasure. Thank you.
