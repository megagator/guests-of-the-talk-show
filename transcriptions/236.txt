[00:00.000 --> 00:04.320]  Dieter Bohn, first time on the talk show. It's been too long without having you on.
[00:04.320 --> 00:07.440]  Yeah. I've been a long-time listener. It's good to be on. How are you doing?
[00:08.400 --> 00:11.840]  Oh, terrible. Today was Gruber family Christmas tree day.
[00:12.400 --> 00:15.360]  It is still... I say was as though it's the past.
[00:18.080 --> 00:24.240]  Well, it's in the house. Our living room is on the second floor. I don't know if you know this
[00:24.240 --> 00:29.440]  or not. I don't know if you follow my wife on Twitter. My wife has a predilection for very
[00:29.440 --> 00:37.040]  large Christmas trees. So take a tape measure, measure the ceiling in your abode, and then add
[00:37.680 --> 00:42.480]  two feet. And that's how big of a Christmas tree she wants. And it is every year.
[00:44.640 --> 00:51.760]  My son even said in the car ride on the way home from the artisanal Christmas tree farm we have to
[00:51.760 --> 01:03.680]  drive to. Doesn't it feel like it was just yesterday? At least this one fits in the house.
[01:03.680 --> 01:08.000]  That's all I can say. But to get it up on the second floor, it is so hard.
[01:08.640 --> 01:12.240]  And then try to pick up all the needles on the way up. It's just a disaster.
[01:12.240 --> 01:16.080]  Do you know what, though? We've been doing this for a long time. My wife and I have been together
[01:16.080 --> 01:20.560]  for many years, and we've always had a big Christmas tree. And it's always a huge
[01:20.560 --> 01:25.520]  mess getting the damn thing out of the house. And then I don't know why. And this is just me being
[01:25.520 --> 01:30.320]  an idiot. This seems like something I should have thought of years ago. But last year we had a tree
[01:30.320 --> 01:34.880]  that we moved to a bigger house a couple years ago. Well, a house with higher ceilings, at least.
[01:35.440 --> 01:40.240]  So we got a bigger tree than ever last year. And it was literally impossible. I honestly didn't
[01:40.240 --> 01:44.320]  see how we were going to get it out of the house. I mean, you get it in because it's tied up. You
[01:44.320 --> 01:48.960]  know what I mean? They tie these trees up and you get it in. And then it opens up. And it's
[01:48.960 --> 01:54.080]  you know, it's honestly like the Christmas Vacation movie where it's flowing and then
[01:54.080 --> 01:58.000]  all of a sudden it's like there's no room for anything in the living room other than this giant
[01:58.000 --> 02:03.200]  tree. But then, you know, how do you get this tree out? Well, you cut it up. So we got like one of
[02:03.200 --> 02:09.280]  these big, like hand shears. You know what I mean? It's like the world's biggest pair of scissors,
[02:09.280 --> 02:14.560]  effectively. What you should have done was gotten a chainsaw. That's what I was thinking. See,
[02:14.560 --> 02:21.280]  here, you think more like me. I thought chainsaw and my wife, I think sensibly, I think,
[02:21.920 --> 02:27.840]  bought this hand tool. And, and again, I will have to give her credit. She's the one who cut it up.
[02:27.840 --> 02:30.720]  But yeah, it's sort of like dismembering a body, you know,
[02:33.440 --> 02:37.840]  like one finger at a time. But we got the tree. It's been a long day.
[02:38.400 --> 02:43.280]  Yeah, man. It's funny. You know, my family's in Minnesota, my wife's family's in Arkansas.
[02:43.280 --> 02:48.960]  And so we're always traveling on the holidays. And so we haven't had a tree in a while. But
[02:48.960 --> 02:53.760]  my family in Minnesota, we used to have a tree. And then my mom decided, screw it. And she got
[02:53.760 --> 02:58.400]  a fake tree. And it's gotten to the point now where they don't even take the decorations off
[02:58.400 --> 03:03.120]  the thing anymore. They just fold up the plastic with the decorations on it, stick a trash bag
[03:03.120 --> 03:07.040]  over it, put it in the garage. And then the day before we show up, you know, every year for
[03:07.040 --> 03:10.240]  Christmas, they just pull it out, pull the trash bag off, stick it in the living room, and it's
[03:10.240 --> 03:16.640]  done. If you've got room that sounds so delightful, compared to the mess that we're in. So we're
[03:16.640 --> 03:20.880]  recording. And then after we record, I've got to string up the lights. That's my job. And
[03:23.760 --> 03:27.840]  with any tree, I think with a normal sized tree, it takes forever to put the lights on the tree.
[03:27.840 --> 03:32.240]  But with a giant ass tree, it takes forever. I don't know, I'll be drunk.
[03:33.520 --> 03:34.960]  Good. It's the right way to do it.
[03:34.960 --> 03:40.880]  All right, you and you did something crazy. You said what you bought a Surface Go?
[03:41.520 --> 03:47.200]  Yeah. So I, you know, I just reviewed the Pixel Slate, I played around with the iPad Pro a little
[03:47.200 --> 03:53.680]  bit. And I have last year's iPad Pro. And I, you know, I've got a Surface Pro that I, you know,
[03:53.680 --> 03:57.360]  use every now and then, although most of the time when I'm at home, I use a Pixelbook. Anyway,
[03:57.360 --> 04:04.960]  I was like, look, I want to I want a tablet that has LTE. And I have a unhealthy,
[04:05.680 --> 04:12.240]  unexplainable obsession with tiny computers. My favorite computer of all time, bar none,
[04:12.880 --> 04:18.640]  was the the 12 inch MacBook back in the day. And then I used the the new the new 12 inch MacBook,
[04:18.640 --> 04:23.600]  whatever, whatever we call that thing. Wait, what do you mean back in the day?
[04:23.600 --> 04:28.080]  The power book? The when there was the mini me commercial? The little guy?
[04:28.800 --> 04:34.320]  What was that? What was what was that? Was that a powered? Or was it 11 inch? It was called a
[04:34.320 --> 04:38.320]  power book. Yeah. How big was that? I know which one you're talking about. Because I had the
[04:38.320 --> 04:45.360]  keyboard that went all the way to the edge. Yeah. I shouldn't be drawing a blank on this. But all
[04:45.360 --> 04:48.800]  right, keep going. Anyway, that was my favorite computer. So I love tiny computers. I was like,
[04:48.800 --> 04:53.120]  all right, I'm gonna I'm gonna give the Surface Go a shot because I had I bought the LTE version.
[04:53.120 --> 04:58.880]  Microsoft was completely incompetent at shipping the thing because it turns out that if you don't
[04:58.880 --> 05:02.880]  actually run a massive retail operation, you just sell, you know, computers on the side,
[05:02.880 --> 05:08.560]  you don't know how to do it. Anyway, I finally got the thing. And I'm really impressed with
[05:08.560 --> 05:14.720]  how well Windows integrates with LTE, it just silently falls back when you need it. But I'm,
[05:14.720 --> 05:18.720]  you know, still my feelings on Windows are the same as they ever are, which is they,
[05:18.720 --> 05:24.800]  they laid a great foundation, and then they forgot to furnish it. They laid the foundation,
[05:24.800 --> 05:29.840]  they built the house, the house is okay, it's not the best house, it's like a ranch. And then they
[05:29.840 --> 05:33.600]  just forgot to put any furniture in it. And they assumed other people would come in and make apps
[05:33.600 --> 05:40.880]  for it. And nobody did. And so it's it's a little bit. I don't know, I can I can get a little bit
[05:40.880 --> 05:46.400]  more done on it than I can on an iPad Pro simply because I need so much web app stuff for my job.
[05:46.400 --> 05:52.960]  But generally speaking, it's it's it's nice because it it forces me to not work that hard
[05:52.960 --> 05:59.360]  because you can't do that much. It was in fact a 12 inch PowerBook G4. It was a PowerBook. Okay.
[05:59.360 --> 06:03.920]  Yeah, I don't know why I was I don't know why 12 inch threw me off. I should have known that because
[06:03.920 --> 06:10.960]  that is the computer and I'm with you on the small computers. That is the PowerBook that
[06:10.960 --> 06:17.440]  I never owned one because at the time, I couldn't really afford it slash justify it because I had
[06:17.440 --> 06:23.200]  like a super fancy desktop. And I really, really only needed a laptop occasionally. So I got the
[06:24.240 --> 06:30.560]  the iBook instead. Yeah. But I like side eyed that one because it was so gorgeous. I mean,
[06:30.560 --> 06:34.320]  I've talked to Jason Snell about this too. I remember just just a couple years ago. I mean,
[06:34.320 --> 06:38.080]  it wasn't that reason at this point, but maybe like two or three years ago, I was in a coffee
[06:38.080 --> 06:44.080]  shop here in Philly and I saw somebody with one. Oh, wow. But at a glance, I couldn't quite you
[06:44.080 --> 06:49.440]  know, it was just somebody at a table and I saw it and I was like, holy shit, what is that laptop?
[06:49.440 --> 06:54.400]  That is amazing. That is the first non Apple laptop I've seen in years that makes me really,
[06:54.400 --> 06:58.000]  really jealous. Yeah. And then I like did the double take and looked and I was like,
[06:58.000 --> 07:03.920]  Oh, it is an Apple laptop. And it's ancient. And it's super thick. But at a glance, just looking
[07:03.920 --> 07:11.040]  at it like top down with that keyboard, it was like, Oh man, that is perfect. Yeah. I was a grad
[07:11.040 --> 07:16.560]  student at the time and I would bike to school. And so it was small enough to fit my bag with,
[07:16.560 --> 07:21.520]  you know, the five books I had to stick in my backpack or whatever it was. And I would always
[07:21.520 --> 07:27.040]  impress people when I would pull it out because they couldn't believe that it existed. And like,
[07:27.040 --> 07:32.000]  honestly, that computer in a lot of ways was one of the reasons I like dropped out of grad school,
[07:32.000 --> 07:35.360]  went into technology because everyone's like, what is that thing? And I talked about the thing and
[07:35.360 --> 07:41.680]  then all of a sudden, like I was I realized I was more interested in the computer than I was in,
[07:41.680 --> 07:53.440]  you know, semiotics. So you bought the surface? I did. It's about the same size recording the
[07:53.440 --> 07:58.080]  show on what are you using to record this? I'm on I'm on a 13 inch MacBook Pro with a touch bar,
[07:58.080 --> 08:03.280]  which I regret getting the touch bar, not just getting the escape because I really hate the
[08:03.280 --> 08:07.200]  touch bar. But I wanted just that little bit of extra power because I have it in my head
[08:07.920 --> 08:11.680]  because I make YouTube videos that I'm going to go into this world where I'm going to
[08:11.680 --> 08:15.120]  shoot some stuff and do some basic editing myself and then hand it off to somebody that
[08:15.120 --> 08:20.960]  actually knows what they're doing. But I have yet to figure out how to effectively podcast
[08:20.960 --> 08:25.280]  on anything else other than a Mac. I've taken a little bit of time and played around with some
[08:25.280 --> 08:30.240]  stuff. But when it comes down, if I don't have audio hijack, I just feel like I don't know what
[08:30.240 --> 08:36.800]  I'm doing. Yeah. And it's, you know, it's I've used this analogy is probably one of my favorite
[08:36.800 --> 08:41.120]  things I've ever written, but that the more or less that it's the heaviness of the Mac that
[08:41.120 --> 08:47.440]  allows iOS to remain light, you know, and and you know what we and we've all in the last two months,
[08:47.440 --> 08:53.680]  everybody in our racket has run through this entire circle of these two and ones, you know,
[08:53.680 --> 09:02.640]  yeah, from the iPad to the surfaces to now now Google's in it with the pixel slate. And that
[09:02.640 --> 09:08.960]  the iPad is going at it from this sort of blown up phone OS. And it doesn't do a lot. And all of
[09:08.960 --> 09:15.120]  these complaints are around things that a quote unquote, real computer can do, or makes easy,
[09:15.120 --> 09:18.960]  or you don't have to think about and the iPad either can't do or you've got to jump through
[09:18.960 --> 09:23.760]  a million hoops. And then you know, like the Chromebooks and the Windows computers are coming
[09:23.760 --> 09:31.600]  from a PC and trying to put a iPad a tablet interface on and they are in to me in a nutshell,
[09:31.600 --> 09:37.360]  they all fall short in the most obvious way, which is that none of them really make jump the chasm
[09:37.360 --> 09:44.800]  from where they started that the iPad is still fundamentally a big phone tablet. And the the
[09:44.800 --> 09:49.520]  computer ones like the Chromebooks and the Windows ones never really get the simplified thing. But
[09:49.520 --> 09:53.840]  one of the things you don't even think about is the way that on a Mac, you've got so many audio
[09:53.840 --> 09:59.360]  options. And like, every app running on your computer can listen to the microphone company,
[09:59.360 --> 10:05.280]  you know, the USB microphone coming in if it wants to, and on the iPad. No.
[10:06.400 --> 10:11.440]  Well, and you also you just have so much more ability to really sort of fiddle with the way
[10:11.440 --> 10:15.680]  it works. What's the what's the other app that rogue Amoeba does that lets you squirt audio to
[10:15.680 --> 10:19.920]  different sources and mix and match where it comes in and where it goes. I used to use that
[10:19.920 --> 10:28.000]  all the time. There's audio hijack. And what else do they have? They've got the new one called
[10:29.040 --> 10:34.640]  they just have an update to loopback. But that does that similarly loopback is like you can,
[10:35.520 --> 10:39.680]  like if I want to if I played sound effects on my podcast or have a theme song, I could play
[10:39.680 --> 10:43.840]  the theme song right now. And then you would be able to hear it because it would I could if I so
[10:43.840 --> 10:48.800]  choose, pump the audio through to Skype or, or whatever. Right. And back in the day, if you
[10:48.800 --> 10:54.000]  wanted to record Skype, that was the only thing that you could use because you wanted to record
[10:54.000 --> 10:57.360]  locally, you didn't want to just record the output from Skype, and then you'd want to, like,
[10:57.360 --> 11:02.800]  take it from one thing to the next. So it was a whole fiasco. Yeah, the thing about like all
[11:02.800 --> 11:07.760]  these different, I wish there was a better term than future of computer computers. But that's
[11:07.760 --> 11:11.760]  kind of where we're at. I've been talking about like big screen computers, just to try and, you
[11:11.760 --> 11:17.680]  know, admit that phones are everybody's primary device these days. I think you're right that the
[11:17.680 --> 11:23.760]  the where they start is kind of where they are now. And party up until this year, and maybe last
[11:23.760 --> 11:27.520]  year, I was relatively forgiving, especially with the iPad was like, look, they're, they're gonna
[11:27.520 --> 11:32.080]  get there. It started as you know, a blown up phone, but they've done a really good job of
[11:32.080 --> 11:37.520]  making the UI work on the big screen. And they're trying to, like, think beyond what just, you know,
[11:37.520 --> 11:43.600]  click traditional windowing are, and that'll be fine. But at this point, it's, it's been a really
[11:43.600 --> 11:49.200]  long time, right? Like iPad has been around a long time. Yeah, I just, I just mentioned that it's,
[11:49.200 --> 11:55.680]  it's 2010. And so it's eight years, you know, eight and a half years, really. That's a long
[11:55.680 --> 12:01.040]  time. And like my thing that I compared it to, and I, it's not the first time other people have done
[12:01.040 --> 12:04.480]  this in years past, but now that we're eight and a half years in, but just comparing it to the Mac
[12:04.480 --> 12:09.680]  when the Mac was eight years old, which would be around 1992 or so. So it's like, that was one year
[12:09.680 --> 12:16.880]  into the system seven era. And the Mac was totally like the cloud that was like the the peak of the
[12:16.880 --> 12:21.840]  classic Mac era, if anything, you know, it was, it wasn't just that the Mac was ahead of the iPad,
[12:21.840 --> 12:27.840]  it was like the classic Mac had reached its apex, if anything, entire industries like graphic design
[12:27.840 --> 12:35.200]  and the print industry had it were it within eight years, the entire print industry had been completely
[12:37.280 --> 12:43.040]  blown away, and everything was based on Macintosh computers, which, when I was young, you know,
[12:43.040 --> 12:46.560]  and that was, you know, I was like, you know, first couple years of college, and then I came
[12:46.560 --> 12:51.680]  out of college and worked in the graphic design industry. It all seemed very normal to me as like,
[12:51.680 --> 12:56.160]  you know, 21 year old 22 year old that Yeah, of course, all of this stuff revolves around
[12:56.160 --> 12:59.920]  Macintosh is this what it would, you'd have to be an animal to do this some other way.
[13:00.480 --> 13:06.560]  But in hindsight, now that I'm in my 40s, and I think about an industry that completely dropped
[13:06.560 --> 13:11.280]  everything it did every technology from what the designers use to what the guys in the print shop
[13:11.280 --> 13:17.040]  did in eight years. Everything was thrown out, they just threw it all out and switched everything
[13:17.040 --> 13:23.680]  to Macintosh computers. It was amazing. You know, is there is there any like, are there any parallels
[13:23.680 --> 13:28.080]  to that today? I really have to stretch my mind to think of something. And, you know, you say that
[13:28.080 --> 13:33.600]  the the Mac being heavy is what lets the iPad be light. But I think it also it gives people an
[13:33.600 --> 13:39.280]  excuse not to do that with the iPad. Yeah. If since the Mac is there, you don't have to convert
[13:39.280 --> 13:44.400]  everything over to the iPad. And that in some ways holds it back. Yeah, in some ways. And I think
[13:44.400 --> 13:49.600]  that's the fear that some Macintosh fans have. And like I've said recently, like, if anything,
[13:49.600 --> 13:56.320]  I would be if I was a fan of one of the had to, you know, had all of my chips in one of Apple's
[13:56.320 --> 14:01.360]  platforms. The one that I would be the most worried about if I was all in on would be iPad,
[14:01.360 --> 14:05.840]  because it's the iPad that's never gotten to love like the Mac users are the ones who are paranoid
[14:05.840 --> 14:10.640]  and have this fear that Apple wants is going to abandon the Mac and have everybody, you know,
[14:10.640 --> 14:17.920]  just use iPads or stick iOS on a laptop or big s 30 inch, you know, iMac style thing.
[14:17.920 --> 14:23.440]  But if anything that, you know, it's the iPad that seemed the least love over the last eight years
[14:23.440 --> 14:28.560]  really has. Yeah, just in terms of I mean, they, they added the split screen, and there's a little
[14:28.560 --> 14:33.360]  slide over thing. And you know, there's a few of those accommodations. But it's, it's like,
[14:33.360 --> 14:39.040]  you need to be like an alchemist, you need to be a wizard to really get to some stuff that feels
[14:39.040 --> 14:44.000]  pretty basic. And it's like drag and drop, and even the file management stuff. And I recognize
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.560]  whenever I talk about this people in media, like, well, you're, you're asking for the past, you're
[14:48.560 --> 14:54.880]  asking for, like, mainframe computers and command lines in an age of the GUI and just accept the
[14:54.880 --> 15:02.320]  future. And like, I'm trying, I'm trying super hard. Whenever I am not at my office, I am using
[15:02.320 --> 15:06.000]  one of these computers and trying to use it in the way that it's meant. And I just, I hit that wall
[15:06.720 --> 15:10.240]  every time. And there are different walls for these different computers. So like the Surface
[15:10.240 --> 15:16.400]  Go, the thing that's really interesting about Windows is it never tells you no. It never says,
[15:16.400 --> 15:21.120]  hey, you know what, I can't do this. There's this weird wall here. And you know, you have no idea
[15:21.120 --> 15:24.960]  how to get a file onto this thing. You can always do whatever the hell you want on a Windows
[15:24.960 --> 15:30.880]  computer. But on a Surface Go, being able to do whatever the hell you want ends up being a huge
[15:30.880 --> 15:35.760]  problem, right? The cognitive load ends up being holding yourself back from like opening up the
[15:35.760 --> 15:41.360]  10th Chrome tab. Whereas that's not a problem on the iPad, the iPad will never screw up. But
[15:41.360 --> 15:46.160]  there's just things that it just refuses to do. Yeah, you can't really you can't shoot yourself
[15:46.160 --> 15:50.480]  with an iPad. Yeah. And sometimes, you know, sometimes you need a gun.
[15:54.560 --> 16:03.200]  So the Surface Go is Yeah, is the one that does it? I get confused. Which one is the Surface Go?
[16:03.200 --> 16:07.520]  So the Surface Go is the, it's the tiny one. So Microsoft, their whole Surface line, they've got
[16:07.520 --> 16:11.360]  the Surface Pro, which is their their, you know, thing with the kickstand. And, you know, they've
[16:11.360 --> 16:16.400]  been around forever. And it started off really badly, because they had it running Windows RT,
[16:16.400 --> 16:20.400]  which was an embarrassment of an operating system. And then Windows 8 didn't make it much better,
[16:20.400 --> 16:24.960]  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's come around to being a really nice, pretty, like flexible device,
[16:24.960 --> 16:29.200]  and people like it. But I think most people just use it as a laptop. And then every now and then,
[16:29.200 --> 16:34.880]  if you want to read a book or something, you can, you know, flip the keyboard around. The Surface
[16:34.880 --> 16:40.240]  Go is the tiny version of it. So it's, I forget the size of the screen. It's like, I don't know,
[16:40.240 --> 16:44.320]  10 inches or something pretty ridiculous. But it's about the size of the small iPad.
[16:45.760 --> 16:52.960]  And meaning meaning not the iPad Mini, but like the the smaller, like the 11 inch iPad Pro. Yeah.
[16:52.960 --> 16:58.720]  And the reason I like it is one, it lets me, you know, do a little bit more work stuff than I can
[16:58.720 --> 17:03.040]  on an iPad, just because like, I need to drag and drop an image without having to, you know,
[17:03.040 --> 17:07.840]  try four times in a row to do it like it honestly comes down to that. But also they have a version
[17:07.840 --> 17:14.320]  that has LTE. And, man, I, I do not ever want to buy another computer again, that doesn't have LTE
[17:14.320 --> 17:21.120]  built in. And I understand why companies don't make them, they barely sell. Especially if you
[17:21.120 --> 17:26.400]  especially if you have a computer with an Intel chip, getting it to integrate well, turns out to
[17:26.400 --> 17:29.920]  be pretty difficult. And you have to have a whole lot of extra parts on there. Whereas on an ARM
[17:29.920 --> 17:35.440]  chip, you know, the whole thing can be built into the the SOC. I wonder if that's the long story
[17:35.440 --> 17:42.720]  short of why Apple still doesn't have a MacBook with LTE. And because when you ask them, they they
[17:42.720 --> 17:49.120]  they really go off the rails. I mean, they Apple product marketing people are usually very good
[17:49.120 --> 17:54.720]  about even giving a non answer. But the non answer on why aren't there LTE Max is really like,
[17:55.680 --> 17:58.960]  I get to the end of it. I'm like, what did you say? I don't even understand what I don't even
[17:58.960 --> 18:03.840]  understand what you just said. Like, they have an answer ready to go. But it's like talks you
[18:03.840 --> 18:08.720]  around in a circle. And it's like you feel like you just got pickpocketed. Yeah, I think that
[18:08.720 --> 18:16.080]  putting LTE on a computer represents like a half dozen compromises. You compromise on sales numbers
[18:16.080 --> 18:21.040]  because no one no one buys them really. You compromise on the system design of the thing
[18:21.040 --> 18:25.360]  itself because you have to put an extra Qualcomm chip and then you have to make sure it works in
[18:25.360 --> 18:30.560]  there. And then you got to figure out how that goes. You and then you compromise on the body
[18:30.560 --> 18:35.120]  of the computer because you have to have a SIM card, right? Well, and you have the antennas.
[18:35.120 --> 18:40.400]  Yeah. And the other thing about the antenna is that everybody on all of these devices,
[18:40.400 --> 18:45.280]  everybody wants to use aluminum right now. Yeah, aluminum is the material of the decade.
[18:45.280 --> 18:49.520]  And you can't get cell signals through metal, right? So you've got to have some, you know,
[18:49.520 --> 18:54.080]  you got to do something to get the antenna on the outside. Yeah. And I just think that you start
[18:54.080 --> 18:58.080]  stacking those compromises up. And I don't know, Johnny Iver, somebody inside Apple is just like,
[18:58.080 --> 19:04.000]  nope, that's, that's one too far. I mean, I'm sure that if Apple could, they would, they'd get rid of
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.800]  the, you know, the SIM card door on the iPhone, right. And they would be right to, but the way
[19:08.800 --> 19:16.960]  that, you know, carriers work. So this is actually a good, I didn't have this in my notes to talk
[19:16.960 --> 19:21.280]  about, but I should, because it's the sort of thing that I don't want to write an article about
[19:21.280 --> 19:27.600]  because I feel like I would waste two days on it. And it's a little too self survey to be an
[19:27.600 --> 19:32.960]  article, but it's a good podcast rant is all right. My family is on Verizon and we have a
[19:32.960 --> 19:38.800]  family plan and Verizon has a pretty good deal. I think you have to pay a $30 activation fee,
[19:38.800 --> 19:45.040]  which is total bullshit. And it really, really, it's like $30. That feels like 300 to me, morally
[19:45.040 --> 19:50.640]  it, I really hate it, but you get an iPad on the family plan. And then after that you just pay 10
[19:50.640 --> 19:56.880]  bucks a month for the extra device and it's just uses the shared pool data. And you can just sort
[19:56.880 --> 20:01.760]  of keep track of how much data your family uses and adjust your plan. You know, it's like turning
[20:01.760 --> 20:06.880]  a dial. They make it very easy to say, you know what, let's go from 15 to 20 because we're going
[20:06.880 --> 20:11.120]  away. You know, the summer we're going to be traveling, we're going to be on LTE all the time.
[20:11.120 --> 20:15.440]  It's once you're on it, it's pretty easy. And so it's only 10 bucks more to get another device on,
[20:15.440 --> 20:20.640]  which is a great deal now. So actually, no, it's not. Well, why are you paying that 10 bucks?
[20:22.560 --> 20:26.480]  I actually, I agree with you that that is actually, it is kind of offensive after they
[20:26.480 --> 20:33.040]  had the activation fee. You're right. But still it, for me, the 10 bucks a month,
[20:33.040 --> 20:39.760]  it, there's a moral outrage that I have to pay anything at all, but yeah, it's, it's a good deal.
[20:40.320 --> 20:47.200]  Yeah. So all of my LTE devices are on Project Fi, which is Google, and I'm sorry, it's called,
[20:47.200 --> 20:50.400]  they just changed the name to Google Fi and a sign that maybe they're not going to kill it. Like
[20:50.400 --> 20:57.280]  they've killed every other communications product they've ever made. And I love it because it's,
[20:57.280 --> 21:00.640]  if you don't use that much data, it's pretty cheap. It's 10 bucks a gig flat. That's it.
[21:00.640 --> 21:06.400]  And it's 20 bucks for a phone line, but data only devices cost nothing. So you can just go to the
[21:06.400 --> 21:11.520]  website and order a data SIM. And I've got like four of them just sitting around and anything you
[21:11.520 --> 21:15.120]  put them in, they just work. They come off the same bucket of data. They don't cost anything
[21:15.120 --> 21:19.600]  per month. They're just around and they've got LTE if you need them. Yeah. And then there's a
[21:19.600 --> 21:25.760]  nice cap on the fee where it's like, if it's one device, I think it's like after six gigabytes,
[21:25.760 --> 21:31.600]  which is 60 bucks, then you don't pay anymore until you get to like 25 gigabytes or something.
[21:31.600 --> 21:34.880]  And then they just slow you down. So yeah, they slow you down and then you can pay a little
[21:34.880 --> 21:39.120]  extra to turn it off. Right. So it's really good. So if you use seven gigabytes or eight gigabytes
[21:39.120 --> 21:45.280]  on a device, you don't even pay over the 60. No, it's, it's a really good rate. Well, here's the
[21:45.280 --> 21:50.560]  thing. I don't use, I don't put my personal iPad on the family Verizon account. I have an AT&T account
[21:50.560 --> 21:58.160]  for it simply because I like the safety of having a second network, you know, especially in airports.
[21:58.160 --> 22:03.120]  I don't know why, but it's like every airport in the country, in my opinion, in my experience,
[22:03.120 --> 22:10.000]  there's like each terminal gets reception on one carrier, maybe. And it's like, of all the places
[22:10.000 --> 22:14.320]  in the country that should be saturated with cell service, it should be airports. Like every single
[22:14.320 --> 22:19.040]  person in the airport is on their phone. I don't understand why airports have such, I don't, I
[22:19.040 --> 22:23.600]  don't know if it's a safety thing or what, but even in 2018, you get terrible cellular reception
[22:23.600 --> 22:29.920]  in airports. And it often helps, you know, like my phone on Verizon gets Nada and the iPad with
[22:29.920 --> 22:37.600]  AT&T gets something. But it's, it's like your options on AT&T. And because I just got a new
[22:37.600 --> 22:41.600]  iPad, I reviewed it, I reviewed the whole thing. And what am I paying for? And it's like,
[22:41.600 --> 22:47.760]  I think it's like 15 bucks a month that you can get something from AT&T, but it's literally like
[22:47.760 --> 22:54.160]  250 megabytes or something of data. It is preposterously low. So I'm paying 50 bucks a
[22:54.160 --> 22:59.600]  month for my iPad to get seven gigabytes of data, which is a lot of money for a second device. I
[22:59.600 --> 23:05.680]  mean, that's 600 bucks a year, but I checked and I actually like went through my account and looked
[23:05.680 --> 23:10.320]  and I use three, four, you know, last few months, three, four, five gigabytes at a time because I
[23:10.320 --> 23:18.080]  use it all the time when I travel. So I do use it, but it, it kind of sucks. And, and I'm starting,
[23:18.080 --> 23:21.600]  you know, I'm wondering, you know, should I just cancel it and just take my chances with
[23:21.600 --> 23:27.920]  Verizon everywhere. But anyway, here's the thing I went through is my, I had a SIM card for my old
[23:27.920 --> 23:36.800]  iPad on AT&T and I popped it out and I put it in my new iPad, the iPad Pro, and it worked and I'm,
[23:36.800 --> 23:41.920]  I was on the account, but when I went to setting cellular to like, do this thing where I was like,
[23:41.920 --> 23:46.080]  I want to review my account and see if I'm getting the best deal. Should I switch or whatever it
[23:46.080 --> 23:50.400]  would, it, it had like, no, I forget what the interface said, but it was like, it wouldn't let
[23:50.400 --> 23:56.720]  me sign into my AT&T account. And I had to go through this crazy thing and I went through the
[23:56.720 --> 24:01.920]  website and they wouldn't take my password and I had to reset my password and blah, blah, blah.
[24:01.920 --> 24:08.400]  Blah, blah, blah. And it's like, and then I found out the password reset wasn't, wasn't kicking in.
[24:08.400 --> 24:14.320]  And then I found a second form on the AT&T website for like iPad users who can't log in.
[24:15.040 --> 24:19.920]  And instead of just your email address, they wanted your email address and like the E M E I
[24:20.880 --> 24:26.560]  identifier. Yeah. And the SIM card number. So I could get the SIM card number pretty easy,
[24:26.560 --> 24:30.720]  but the E M E I number, it wouldn't work. It kept saying this isn't recognized.
[24:30.720 --> 24:36.880]  And then I realized it was, it probably wanted my old iPad's E M E I number.
[24:37.920 --> 24:41.280]  And I went to the old one and that one didn't work. And then I thought about it and I thought,
[24:41.280 --> 24:48.240]  you know, I've been using AT&T since I had like a 2014 or 2012 iPad mini. I'm like, Jesus, do I
[24:48.240 --> 24:51.840]  even still have that? So I like had to go through my office. I mean, this seriously took me like,
[24:51.840 --> 24:56.960]  like an hour, find an old iPad mini from like 2012. The first one I had with like cellular
[24:56.960 --> 25:03.280]  fire that thing up and get the E M E I number off that. And it worked. Holy shit, that it actually
[25:03.280 --> 25:06.640]  let me in. I mean, I probably should have just called. It actually probably would have taken
[25:06.640 --> 25:11.200]  me less time and less aggravation to actually get on the phone and call them. But yeah, I had
[25:11.200 --> 25:15.680]  to go through all of that. And then it finally worked. And I had the SIM card and I went through
[25:15.680 --> 25:19.040]  all that work to get the SIM card working. And then I thought, well, what about this E SIM thing?
[25:19.040 --> 25:26.000]  Isn't that nice? And so I did the thing to switch my iPad to the E SIM. And that worked.
[25:26.000 --> 25:29.840]  But after I went through all that work to get the SIM card working, and then after I did this,
[25:29.840 --> 25:35.680]  I found out like immediately like within a minute, I was googling something. And I found out that
[25:35.680 --> 25:42.400]  because AT&T is AT&T once you lock your once you put your E SIM on an iPad on AT&T, it is
[25:42.400 --> 25:50.240]  permanently locked to AT&T. What? Yes, I'm not making this up. So even though it's a virtual
[25:50.240 --> 25:55.360]  SIM, it is a virtual SIM, it is permanently locked to AT&T. And I guess there is some kind of
[25:55.360 --> 26:00.960]  way that you can go to an AT&T store and ask them beg them and they'll maybe if you cancel your
[26:00.960 --> 26:06.240]  account, maybe they'll unlock the device. Yeah, I I'm not making this I never would have done this
[26:06.240 --> 26:11.440]  if I had known this, I would have just stuck with the SIM card I had at work. But now, not only is
[26:11.440 --> 26:17.680]  my iPad E SIM locked to AT&T, I no longer have a SIM card, I can pop out and put in a new iPad.
[26:17.680 --> 26:23.040]  Yeah. God, it was what a mistake. What a nightmare. And so of course, long way of saying,
[26:23.040 --> 26:28.720]  I kind of get why device makers are aren't putting LTE into everything. Right? Yeah, fair enough.
[26:28.720 --> 26:34.080]  Yeah. I don't know, I deal with with switching carriers and dealing with this crap all the time.
[26:34.080 --> 26:39.600]  My my biggest headache recently, and this is one that I prayed nobody ever has to deal with was
[26:39.600 --> 26:46.000]  getting the palm phone activated on Verizon. That little thing? Yeah. And by the way, I pray no one
[26:46.000 --> 26:49.280]  ever has to go with this because nobody should buy this thing. I'm actually I'm supposed to put
[26:49.280 --> 26:54.080]  my review of it next week. We'll see if I actually get around to it. All right. Yeah,
[26:54.080 --> 27:01.840]  hold that thought. I'm gonna do my first sponsor. So funny. I do want to talk about that. I have a
[27:01.840 --> 27:09.280]  great sponsor to tell you about. I GG software. This is a company they make an app called bank
[27:09.280 --> 27:14.560]  tivity. It is an easy to use full featured personal finance management app exclusively
[27:14.560 --> 27:22.240]  for Mac and iOS. So this is a company that knows the pain that Mac users have had for decades with
[27:22.240 --> 27:28.640]  personal finance apps that have been dominated by certain company, we found that name, who would
[27:28.640 --> 27:36.800]  have an app that would go literally maybe like a decade between software updates. Yet because,
[27:37.680 --> 27:41.840]  you know, one company dominated the Mac for personal finance, nobody else really entered
[27:41.840 --> 27:48.000]  the field. And they're really just have been a dearth of high quality. Look, this is clearly
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.160]  meant for the Mac. This isn't just a little web view. This isn't something ported over from
[27:52.160 --> 27:59.920]  Windows. It's a real Mac app, a real iPhone app. Bank tivity is that app. It is a terrific app.
[28:02.080 --> 28:09.440]  And it was born on the Mac and really is native for Mac and iOS. It connects
[28:09.440 --> 28:14.320]  to over 10,000 banks, and you can use it to track your checking and savings accounts, credit cards,
[28:15.040 --> 28:20.400]  everything in between your mortgage, real estate loans, investments, retirement accounts, anything
[28:20.400 --> 28:25.040]  you'd want to track in a personal finance app. Bank tivity can do it. Powerful features like
[28:25.040 --> 28:32.000]  customizable reports, budgeting, planning, bill tracking, and more. The latest version
[28:32.000 --> 28:37.280]  up to date, they're a great, great Mac developer already supports Mojave with dark mode support,
[28:37.280 --> 28:44.400]  everything you'd want in a top tier Mac developer. IGG does it. And bank tivity has it. It's a really
[28:44.400 --> 28:48.240]  great app. If you're looking for a personal finance app, I highly recommend it. It really
[28:48.240 --> 28:55.200]  looks great. It's just a super powerful app. And they've got all sorts of information on

[29:52.240 --> 29:58.640]  best personal finance software? My thanks to bank tivity. All right, this palm phone. Yeah.
[29:58.640 --> 30:06.480]  I saw this a month ago, somebody at the Apple. I think it was. I forget what we were doing in
[30:06.480 --> 30:11.280]  New York. I don't know. One of the things Oh, it was the iPhone 10. R. When the iPhone 10. R came
[30:11.280 --> 30:16.240]  out. And there were press briefings in New York, and one of the other writers had had the palm
[30:16.240 --> 30:24.720]  phone. So I got to see it. I wanted it to be good. Yeah, I, I want it to be good. Not not because I
[30:24.720 --> 30:30.160]  have a, you know, super long history with palm. But just because I like the idea. I get small
[30:30.160 --> 30:35.040]  computers, I like the idea of a small phone. And everyone got really jazzed about this idea that
[30:35.040 --> 30:40.720]  you could have a phone that would keep you less distracted. But man, it's just bad. It's bad in
[30:40.720 --> 30:48.800]  every way. And it doesn't have volume buttons. It doesn't have. It doesn't have volume buttons. It
[30:48.800 --> 30:53.760]  it's the battery is terrible, which is, you know, if your whole job is to have a phone that you can
[30:53.760 --> 30:59.600]  take with you on a weekend trip or something, it should last at least a day and it can't. And this
[30:59.600 --> 31:05.760]  isn't just me using it. It's me. I don't know having it around and like turning on every now
[31:05.760 --> 31:11.120]  and then to test it a little bit. It's just it's terrible. I forget who's who had it at the Apple
[31:11.120 --> 31:15.520]  event, but he was showing it and it was 1030 in the morning, or maybe even earlier, but it was
[31:15.520 --> 31:26.960]  around 10 in the morning. And this was at 37%. Yep. It was comical. And I mean, to go back to
[31:26.960 --> 31:34.240]  the carrier stuff, I'm sure you know, the guys started this company. They, you know, one of them
[31:34.240 --> 31:40.800]  was a former Samsung guy, and he made some pretty decent devices for Samsung back in the day. And
[31:40.800 --> 31:46.720]  so I believe that they were like an independent company that started up, but they got captured by
[31:46.720 --> 31:51.840]  Verizon just immediately. So you can't buy this thing on its own. You just can't. You can't go
[31:51.840 --> 31:59.120]  buy it and make it a phone. You can only buy it as an add on device on Verizon. And it is impossible
[31:59.120 --> 32:04.560]  to use it and get text messages on it unless you use Verizon's text messaging app, which is called
[32:04.560 --> 32:14.080]  MessagePlus. If you want to experience the worst messaging app on planet earth, download and install
[32:14.080 --> 32:22.400]  MessagePlus. It has custom emoji. It has a feature if you want where you can have your usage tracked
[32:22.400 --> 32:28.000]  so that they can share your information with oath, AOL oath, you know, the network that owns a bunch
[32:28.000 --> 32:34.640]  of sites. It has a feature where if you want, they can suggest greeting cards to you that you
[32:34.640 --> 32:41.120]  can buy in the app. And it's slow and it's buggy, but it's the only way to get a text message on
[32:41.120 --> 32:47.760]  Verizon that doesn't use the classic SMS system but comes over IP. And that otherwise you just
[32:47.760 --> 32:53.360]  you don't get your text messages on this thing. It's ridiculous. I'm downloading it right now on
[32:53.360 --> 32:59.040]  the on the pixel three. My pixel three is not even on Verizon. So I have no idea. You can actually
[32:59.040 --> 33:05.680]  get it on the iPhone. If you Yes, if you have like so if I if I have my Verizon similar pixel, I can
[33:05.680 --> 33:11.520]  download this on my iPhone and then scan a QR code on the pixel and then it becomes like a little
[33:11.520 --> 33:15.920]  iMessage app, a little text messaging app on the iPhone that gets numbers that are sent to my
[33:15.920 --> 33:21.600]  Verizon. So my pixel phone, it's completely insane. And it's not even on my phone. It's
[33:21.600 --> 33:28.400]  completely insane. It refused to run because I wouldn't give it permission to make phone calls.
[33:28.400 --> 33:36.240]  Yeah, sorry. And this, by the way, is why I spent the last month emailing every single carrier in
[33:36.240 --> 33:42.160]  the U.S. asking them when Rich Communication Services, RCS, is finally going to launch,
[33:42.880 --> 33:49.280]  because I really want to see are they going to be as horrible with RCS as they have been with
[33:49.280 --> 33:55.200]  everything else that they do. It's really bad. And if you don't allow it to take over as your
[33:55.200 --> 34:04.480]  default SMS app, it won't run. Do you want Verizon messages to handle SMS for you? And I said no,
[34:04.480 --> 34:12.560]  and it quit. Yep. Well, I've installed it. You don't really have phones. I mean, and it's,
[34:12.560 --> 34:16.480]  it's like, because I would never install the equivalent of this on my Mac, because I would
[34:16.480 --> 34:23.520]  just assume that it was putting some kind of 11-year-old kernel extension in and doing all
[34:23.520 --> 34:30.960]  sorts of irreparable harm in the library folder. Phone is so fun, even, you know, Android, iPhone,
[34:30.960 --> 34:33.920]  whatever. You can just install it, laugh at it, and then delete it.
[34:38.480 --> 34:42.000]  Well, we put it off long enough. Do you want me to rant about the pixel slate?
[34:42.000 --> 34:47.440]  Yes, the pixel slate. Man. So if you're not familiar,
[34:47.440 --> 34:53.040]  it is Google's new Chrome OS tablet. They've had Chrome OS laptops before. The pixel book was last
[34:53.040 --> 34:56.560]  year. Is it still around? It's actually pretty good. The pixel book is up to number three,
[34:56.560 --> 35:02.080]  right? Isn't it like the third? I forget. So they had, they had Chromebook pixels before,
[35:02.080 --> 35:05.920]  so they had one and two, and then they took a couple of years off and they made the pixel
[35:05.920 --> 35:11.440]  slate or the pixel book. And now they're making the pixel slate, which is the full-on tablet with
[35:11.440 --> 35:19.360]  a detachable keyboard. And man, everything about this thing is just frustrating and usually not
[35:19.360 --> 35:23.920]  good. If you have the keyboard attached and it's sitting on a desk, it basically feels like a
[35:23.920 --> 35:27.040]  pixel book, like a standard Chrome OS device, and you've got windows and all this stuff,
[35:27.040 --> 35:30.560]  and you can move stuff around and you might have a couple of Android apps because it can run
[35:30.560 --> 35:36.800]  Android apps and it's okay. But as soon as you do anything other than that, it just falls completely
[35:36.800 --> 35:44.960]  apart. The response time in tablet mode to move a window around and go into split screen is measured.
[35:44.960 --> 35:51.360]  Like the lag is almost a second, if not more. It should be less than 20 milliseconds for a human
[35:51.360 --> 35:57.840]  not to notice anything. It could be a second. And that's one of those things where I actually read
[35:57.840 --> 36:04.720]  your review first. And then I usually do watch the videos too, but sometimes I find that the videos
[36:04.720 --> 36:08.880]  are spoilers. I'd rather read the whole thing first. And if I'm going to hear something again,
[36:08.880 --> 36:12.880]  I'd rather hear it again in the video than have it spoiled. But anyway, somebody on Twitter
[36:12.880 --> 36:17.600]  mentioned something like, oh my God, I can't see how anybody who watches Dieter's video could
[36:18.640 --> 36:22.480]  not say this thing is a turd. I was like, oh, I got to watch the video. And I watched the video
[36:22.480 --> 36:28.800]  and your description of it as juddery was generous. It's like, how did they ship this?
[36:28.800 --> 36:34.960]  Who at Google in their new hardware division, presumably it's a guy in charge, Rick Osterlow,
[36:34.960 --> 36:39.840]  who is a pretty good guy who came over from Motorola back in the day. Who at Google's job
[36:39.840 --> 36:46.560]  is it to say, no, don't ship this. I don't know who that person is. And that person should have
[36:46.560 --> 36:51.840]  said, like, I honestly don't think they should have shipped this. Or they should not have shipped it
[36:52.640 --> 36:56.560]  with the quote unquote tablet features that it has. I would have much rather,
[36:56.560 --> 37:00.560]  if it had been a tablet and I had to deal with the awkwardness of windows on it, I would have been
[37:00.560 --> 37:04.560]  like, well, or only worked in full screen or something, which is the way Chrome always used
[37:04.560 --> 37:09.440]  to work. I would have been like, well, this is bad, but they'll fix it next year. And in the
[37:09.440 --> 37:13.920]  meantime, at least full screen works if you just want to watch a movie or something, life goes on.
[37:14.720 --> 37:20.720]  Instead, they tried to make it a little bit more iPad-like and it was so bad. I don't understand
[37:20.720 --> 37:25.040]  why nobody just said, hey, you know what? We don't need this. It's not like Google makes
[37:25.040 --> 37:31.280]  any money off of these things. They get nothing out of selling this other than a halo effect.
[37:31.280 --> 37:35.760]  It's sort of like when Microsoft first started making Surface devices, you'd ask, well, why are
[37:35.760 --> 37:40.800]  you making this thing? Well, we're not worried that we're going to undercut our competitors.
[37:40.800 --> 37:44.320]  And honestly, we need to learn how to make these things so that they will learn how to make better
[37:44.320 --> 37:50.240]  things. Because Windows laptops are actually, they had a really long period where they were awful.
[37:50.240 --> 37:54.800]  I mean, and after Microsoft started making the Surface, they all sort of like, oh, wait,
[37:54.800 --> 37:58.880]  we'll do it that way. And they got a little bit better over time. It actually worked. Yeah. What
[37:58.880 --> 38:04.240]  Microsoft said at the time, and there was, you know, as long time, you know, people who've
[38:04.240 --> 38:08.080]  watched the industry, it just seemed bizarre for Microsoft to be making PC hardware when they've
[38:08.080 --> 38:12.880]  been the company that works with every, how can you both be their partner and their competitor?
[38:12.880 --> 38:18.800]  But it worked. It raised the bar, you know, for PC laptops. Yeah. And Google's done the same thing
[38:18.800 --> 38:23.280]  for years with the Nexus devices before they made this hardware division, started calling everything
[38:23.280 --> 38:28.880]  Pixel. And the Chromebook is supposedly in the same category. Like, here's the flagship. We know
[38:28.880 --> 38:33.280]  that 100,000 people at most are going to buy this thing. But whatever, we need to learn how to
[38:33.280 --> 38:38.480]  develop for this new processor. And we want to teach everybody that's making the $300 Chromebooks
[38:38.480 --> 38:43.840]  how to do it better. So we're going to make this thing. But if your flagship Halo device
[38:43.840 --> 38:46.960]  that is supposed to lead the way for the industry of how it's supposed to go,
[38:46.960 --> 38:52.640]  can't move a window around in tablet mode without everything like shuttering to a stop,
[38:53.200 --> 38:57.680]  that's a big problem. And I haven't even that's like, that's just the baseline. Like I have,
[38:57.680 --> 39:01.760]  I could I could go on for another 45 minutes of complaints about how the keyboard folio works,
[39:01.760 --> 39:07.120]  about how Bluetooth crashes, the whole thing was just a mistake. They shouldn't have shipped it.
[39:07.120 --> 39:11.520]  I don't know. I don't know how that happens inside a company like how you get past that,
[39:11.520 --> 39:18.080]  hey, go or no go. And this thing is literally like the software equivalent of crumbling apart.
[39:18.080 --> 39:25.360]  Yeah. I guess that somehow you you you get a, you know, they obviously wanted to announce it
[39:25.360 --> 39:30.320]  alongside the pixel three. So they have this ship date, you know, announcement date in late September,
[39:30.320 --> 39:35.200]  early October, whenever that was. And they somehow had this on the whiteboard that we've got to ship
[39:35.200 --> 39:40.080]  this then. And you know, the hardware, I guess is clearly ready. I don't think I don't think,
[39:40.080 --> 39:46.560]  I don't think, you know, because it works so well in laptop mode. It's not crummy hardware.
[39:46.560 --> 39:50.880]  It's Yeah, no, it's really good hardware, you know, and I feel like that's the problem. I feel
[39:50.880 --> 39:54.960]  like hard, you know, if the hardware is good and hardware, you know, you can't fix can't send over
[39:54.960 --> 39:58.960]  the air patches to hardware, you know, the hardware has to be or not be and you can talk yourself in
[39:58.960 --> 40:04.320]  a circle that well, we can always fix software later, you know. And I guess that's it. Yeah,
[40:04.320 --> 40:09.360]  for Google, in particular with Chrome OS, they've been telling themselves that for literally years,
[40:09.360 --> 40:14.720]  because a new version of Chrome OS comes out every six weeks. And you know, usually it's just bug
[40:14.720 --> 40:20.560]  fixes. And you know, a couple of tweaks here or there. But it's great because you know, it's
[40:20.560 --> 40:26.480]  secure. And little features sort of pop up that are kind of useful. And, you know, it's nice to
[40:26.480 --> 40:31.280]  know that you're not going to have to wait a year for some app to get updated. This is, this is to
[40:31.280 --> 40:37.120]  me, the most frustrating thing about using an iPhone is all of those software developers working
[40:37.120 --> 40:42.000]  on a new version of the app, it all gets bundled into this big, giant iOS update, you know, every
[40:42.000 --> 40:47.840]  September, they've sort of been doing, I think, the last at least two years, Apple has done a
[40:47.840 --> 40:56.240]  better job of having like a dot two or dot three around February or so, or February or March,
[40:56.240 --> 41:02.000]  that is sort of like the high point of the year for the software. Right. But there's an awful
[41:02.000 --> 41:07.120]  lot of features that like, you just know that if it's coming, we've got to wait till September.
[41:07.120 --> 41:10.880]  Yeah, yeah. Well, and, and if you think about it, like, it's actually kind of nuts. Like,
[41:10.880 --> 41:14.960]  could you imagine if Apple wanted to update the, I don't know, the mail client on the Mac? I mean,
[41:14.960 --> 41:19.280]  I guess they kind of wait there. But an Android phone around, I guess, I guess on a pixel,
[41:19.280 --> 41:24.320]  although there aren't really any apps on a pixel that ship built in just a couple. If Google's got
[41:24.320 --> 41:28.480]  a new version of Gmail that they like, they just, it's just there because they ship everything
[41:28.480 --> 41:34.560]  through the infrastructure of the Play Store. Anyway, the point is, Google is able, since
[41:34.560 --> 41:39.680]  they're able to update this Chrome OS operating system every six weeks, anytime something goes
[41:39.680 --> 41:43.520]  out that's like not that great, they know that there's going to be a new version, they can fix
[41:43.520 --> 41:50.560]  it every six weeks. And so I think it might lower the stakes of shipping bad software. Whereas with
[41:50.560 --> 41:54.960]  Apple, if, you know, if they're really going to wait, you know, a year for the next big thing,
[41:54.960 --> 41:59.360]  or they're going to wait till the next big, you know, dot update to go out, if Apple ships
[41:59.360 --> 42:06.800]  something that is subpar, it's a much bigger deal. Yeah, totally. Yeah. And I think that Apple is,
[42:06.800 --> 42:12.080]  it has, I think it's part of the rhythm of the Apple calendar year, you know, the way that Apple
[42:12.080 --> 42:20.400]  sort of does everything, you know, it, they're a very annual company. And in a way that the real
[42:20.400 --> 42:26.640]  test is, can we show this at WWE on stage at WWDC? It does obviously doesn't have to be ready. I
[42:26.640 --> 42:34.080]  mean, beta still means beta. But like, they'll never show a mock up of what it's going to look
[42:34.080 --> 42:39.440]  like, like, when they do a demo of iOS 13, this coming June, whatever they're showing is actual
[42:39.440 --> 42:44.800]  software running on an actual device. And so if it's not in close enough form that they could
[42:44.800 --> 42:50.400]  actually demo it on stage, it doesn't make the cut for iOS 13. It's, you know, you're sorry,
[42:50.400 --> 42:56.480]  you're your team is on iOS 14, you know, yeah, come back next year. And that gives them then
[42:56.480 --> 43:01.440]  three months to get it in shape, you know, like, okay, we've demoed it, we've promised it. Let's,
[43:01.440 --> 43:06.560]  you know, let's actually finish it. But it can't be like, one frame per second.
[43:06.560 --> 43:13.680]  Trenton Larkin Well, and Apple, Apple is so consistent about shipping the stuff that they demo
[43:13.680 --> 43:19.040]  that the few times when they don't, it just it becomes a, you know, a running joke that everybody
[43:19.040 --> 43:24.160]  can can reference and everybody knows about. So right. I mean, FaceTime was FaceTime,
[43:24.160 --> 43:29.440]  airpower. Yeah. You know, I don't know, like open source sync FaceTime, I guess was like one thing,
[43:29.440 --> 43:34.480]  but like, they almost never promised something on stage that they don't eventually ship.
[43:34.480 --> 43:37.760]  Trenton Larkin You know, the story behind the open source FaceTime, right?
[43:38.880 --> 43:41.360]  Trenton Larkin I think so. But tell me.
[43:41.360 --> 43:47.520]  Trenton Larkin I think was it WWDC? Was it? I don't know if it's WWDC or Mac World Expo. I think it
[43:47.520 --> 43:53.120]  was probably a WWDC. But either way, it was a Monday keynote. And it was like Saturday. And
[43:53.120 --> 43:58.320]  they're doing like Saturday or Sunday. So it's like the 48 hours or 24 hours before and they're
[43:58.320 --> 44:02.640]  doing, you know, full dress rehearsal of the keynote. Yeah, I get to the FaceTime part. And
[44:02.640 --> 44:08.800]  Steve Jobs gets to it and says, Hey, what about what about FaceTiming people on other on other
[44:08.800 --> 44:15.040]  devices? You know, wouldn't that be great? You know, not everybody has an iPhone. What about,
[44:15.040 --> 44:18.240]  you know, FaceTiming people on computers? And they're like, Well, I don't know, think about it.
[44:18.240 --> 44:22.000]  And he was like, What if we just open source it? We'll open source it. We don't care. You know,
[44:22.000 --> 44:27.920]  we'll just make it we'll make it a standard. And you're like, All right. And, and the FaceTime team
[44:27.920 --> 44:35.520]  heard about it when they were watching the keynote Monday morning. And so the FaceTime team is like
[44:35.520 --> 44:40.240]  in in their offices watching the live stream, the internal live stream of the keynote, and they hear
[44:40.240 --> 44:44.800]  Steve Jobs saying, we're gonna make it an industry standard, it's gonna be open source. And they're
[44:44.800 --> 44:48.960]  all looking at each other. And they're like, at some of them were mad, because they're like, why
[44:48.960 --> 44:55.760]  didn't they tell me why wasn't I told and then managers are like, I got me. And then engineers
[44:55.760 --> 45:00.720]  were like, Well, we didn't write this, you know, we can't open up the source. This is also, you
[45:00.720 --> 45:05.440]  know, there's x, y, and z reasons that, you know, if you were going to make it open, you would write
[45:05.440 --> 45:10.080]  it, you know, a different way, right? Or not use certain patents or license certain things. So like,
[45:10.080 --> 45:15.120]  we can't open source this. And, and basically, that's one of the reasons why I mean, there was
[45:15.120 --> 45:19.920]  like a very specific lawsuit that Apple was involved in, over some kind of awful, awful
[45:19.920 --> 45:24.640]  software patent. And it's partly why FaceTime got bad for a couple of years, because they actually
[45:24.640 --> 45:30.000]  had to like, change the code. But so there's other reasons, too. But basically, long story short of
[45:30.000 --> 45:35.040]  why FaceTime never went open sources. It was, it never really could. It was just something Steve
[45:35.040 --> 45:39.920]  Jobs pulled out of his ass like the weekend before. So I've heard I don't know this for a
[45:39.920 --> 45:44.480]  fact. I don't have. I don't have a first hand report of that. I have a secondhand report of
[45:44.480 --> 45:49.600]  that. But that's incredible. Sounds true, right? Yeah, totally sounds like Steve Jobs. Right.
[45:49.600 --> 45:57.680]  But yeah, I think that that that that June, WWDC, you know, tentpole in the calendar,
[45:58.320 --> 46:02.320]  of if we don't, if we can't show it, you know, it doesn't ship in September. I mean,
[46:02.320 --> 46:05.840]  the only thing that they that they ship in September that they don't show at WWDC
[46:06.480 --> 46:12.320]  are features specific to the new phone, you know, like, so face ID, they didn't show, but I think
[46:12.320 --> 46:17.520]  internally, you know, it obviously had to be ready, you know, months in advance. It's not like
[46:17.520 --> 46:21.040]  it's not like in June, you could say, well, FaceTime isn't working yet. But don't worry,
[46:21.040 --> 46:23.360]  we'll, we'll have it by September.
[46:26.720 --> 46:32.000]  It just doesn't does it different. They're always they just ship stuff constantly throughout the
[46:32.000 --> 46:36.640]  year. And so it's funny, in some ways, you know, their big developer conferences, Google IO in
[46:36.640 --> 46:42.720]  in May. And in some ways, it's just like, well, we'll just we'll just announce whatever is close
[46:42.720 --> 46:47.680]  right now, I guess. But that doesn't nobody actually like holds anything for this is the
[46:47.680 --> 46:53.360]  stuff that's ready this week. So like the thing I got it, you know, I people were mad at me because
[46:53.360 --> 46:56.400]  I called them out on it. But they they had the what was the thing called where they were gonna
[46:56.400 --> 47:03.920]  do Plex duplex. Yes. And I said, Hey, this looks looks like a pile of shit. And here we are in
[47:03.920 --> 47:09.920]  November, and there's still no duplex. There's a very cool similar feature in in, in the latest
[47:09.920 --> 47:16.480]  Android operating system that your phone can answer a robo caller, a super cool feature that I
[47:16.480 --> 47:23.760]  really, really hope Apple can somehow steal. Because it's awesome, but it isn't duplex. It
[47:23.760 --> 47:30.560]  isn't. It isn't telling your Google Assistant to make you a dentist appointment. So yeah,
[47:30.560 --> 47:36.400]  it's launched in like a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny beta. And we've actually managed to make a couple
[47:36.400 --> 47:40.800]  reservations for it. There was a thing last week where someone at a restaurant posted a recording
[47:40.800 --> 47:47.040]  of it. And it was just like, yeah, and and you listen to it. And it says, Hey, I'm from Google,
[47:47.040 --> 47:51.520]  something, something, something. But it never said I'm a robot, right? Or never said I'm the
[47:51.520 --> 47:55.760]  assistant. It's just that I'm calling from Google on behalf of so and so. And so like,
[47:55.760 --> 48:00.800]  you change your disclosure, this is bad. And it turns out that that was one of the duplex calls
[48:00.800 --> 48:07.600]  that was actually completed by a human being. And so it's, and the other thing is, so far as we can
[48:07.600 --> 48:12.400]  tell, the only restaurants that it's rolled out to are restaurants that have, like already a
[48:12.400 --> 48:17.920]  pre existing pretty close relationship with Google through their their small business thing. And,
[48:17.920 --> 48:22.880]  and so, I don't know, I think it's gonna be a long time before this becomes a regular feature that
[48:22.880 --> 48:28.160]  that anybody uses. People totally misunderstood my skepticism to like, I wasn't saying like,
[48:28.160 --> 48:32.880]  you know, and people, some people jump on the whole, like, they think that I'm in the bag for
[48:32.880 --> 48:37.200]  Apple. And they're like, Oh, my God, can you think Syria is so great? You know, you have no idea how
[48:37.200 --> 48:41.600]  good Google Assistant is. It's like, No, I know exactly how good Google Assistant is. I use these
[48:41.600 --> 48:46.800]  things. And I get it. And I totally understand that if there's any organization on earth,
[48:46.800 --> 48:52.160]  that might have something like this actually working in a lab, it's my money would be on
[48:52.160 --> 48:59.280]  Google, you know, maybe my second bet would be on Amazon. You know, I get it that Google is working
[48:59.280 --> 49:04.000]  on things like this, I get it that we will this something like this will be available eventually.
[49:04.000 --> 49:08.560]  I'm just saying that what they showed on stage, and said would be shipping in a couple of weeks.
[49:09.200 --> 49:14.240]  And, you know, in the quote, unquote, near future to like, everybody, it that isn't,
[49:14.880 --> 49:16.720]  that isn't what they're that isn't happening.
[49:17.440 --> 49:21.760]  Yeah, well, you know, there may be no other organization that could do this than Google,
[49:21.760 --> 49:24.800]  but there's also I don't know if there's any other organization that could be as,
[49:26.080 --> 49:30.400]  I don't know, make an unforced error of not understanding how people would react to it.
[49:30.400 --> 49:36.480]  Yes, right. So it doesn't occur to them that people might be, one skeptical about the,
[49:36.480 --> 49:39.760]  you know, whatever edits they made to the audio to like, have it fit in the keynote,
[49:39.760 --> 49:43.520]  like, is this real or not? And to that people would be like, wait a minute, I don't know if
[49:43.520 --> 49:47.360]  I want to talk to a robot. Like it just they're like, they're so impressed with how cool it is,
[49:47.360 --> 49:52.000]  they doesn't, they don't think about that there are people outside of the Silicon Valley bubble,
[49:52.000 --> 49:57.120]  they'll be like, wait a minute, that's or no, or not that you don't want to talk to a robot,
[49:57.120 --> 50:02.800]  but that you don't want to sick a robot on your hairstylist, you know, like, hey, I've been going
[50:02.800 --> 50:09.040]  to her for 10 years, she knows me. I don't want to have her talking to a creepy robot on behalf
[50:09.040 --> 50:16.000]  of me. And then I go in there and have to look her in the eye. And oh, yeah, I did that. I sent
[50:16.000 --> 50:20.480]  a robot to make this appointment for me. Even though, you know, and again, it will happen.
[50:20.480 --> 50:26.400]  And we will be doing it and it'll all seem normal. But it has to has to be introduced the right way.
[50:26.400 --> 50:32.640]  Yeah. I want to keep talking on some of this Google stuff. And I want to talk definitely
[50:32.640 --> 50:36.080]  want to talk about the pixel three. But in the meantime, I'm gonna take another break here and
[50:36.080 --> 50:42.720]  thank our next sponsor. This sponsor, you've got to remember this fracture. Now you know who
[50:42.720 --> 50:47.600]  fractures fracture that you send them photos, they print them on glass. I told you last episode,
[50:48.160 --> 50:53.280]  that you should pause the episode right now as you listen to it and go order your fracture prints for
[50:53.280 --> 50:58.640]  the holidays. As I speak to you, I don't know when you're going to listen to this episode. But as I
[50:58.640 --> 51:02.880]  speak to you, they've already got a ship date in like the middle of December, it's like December
[51:02.880 --> 51:07.600]  13. If you order today, but you can order today, because you're not going to hear this episode
[51:07.600 --> 51:14.560]  today. So by tomorrow, it might be December 14, might be December 15. Don't wait. This is such a
[51:14.560 --> 51:19.600]  great gift idea. Get them for anybody who you have any anybody in your family, your parents send them
[51:19.600 --> 51:26.080]  pictures of your kids or your dog or cat, send them pictures of you. Anybody in your family,
[51:26.080 --> 51:30.400]  get them for your spouse, get them for your significant other. Everybody loves pictures.
[51:31.040 --> 51:36.800]  fracture pictures look awesome. They are terrific, terrific pictures, super high quality,
[51:36.800 --> 51:40.480]  printed directly on the glass, everything you need to hang it up on the wall or put it on the mantle,
[51:40.480 --> 51:43.840]  whatever you need. Everything comes in a box. You don't need a frame. You don't need anything
[51:43.840 --> 51:48.240]  to prop it up. But it's such a great gift idea. But you cannot wait because it will,
[51:48.240 --> 51:53.600]  you know, they get backed up. They print all these things down in their factory down in Gainesville,
[51:53.600 --> 51:58.880]  Florida, right here in the USA, ecola, echo, ecologically friendly. It's all green. You can
[51:58.880 --> 52:04.080]  feel good about that. Don't pause the episode. Yeah, I know I said that last time. It's probably
[52:04.080 --> 52:08.080]  nonsense. You're not going to break break the flow of this show. But make a note to yourself,
[52:08.080 --> 52:13.440]  put a big sticky right now, wherever you are to remind yourself that when you're done listening
[52:13.440 --> 52:17.440]  to the show, take an hour, go through your photos from the last year, pick out your favorites,
[52:18.400 --> 52:23.440]  send them to fracture, get them printed out as gift ideas. And you'll thank me for it. It's
[52:23.440 --> 52:28.880]  really just the best gift idea ever. But you're running out of time. Where do you go to find out
[52:28.880 --> 52:41.040]  more? Go to fracture me.com fracture me.com slash talk ta Okay, just talk ta Okay, and you'll get
[52:41.040 --> 52:47.600]  a special discount on your first fracture order. And seriously, that's the that's your whole to do
[52:47.600 --> 52:53.600]  list for the rest of the day finish this episode, me and Dieter talking about pixel three, iPhones,
[52:53.600 --> 52:59.280]  cameras, whatever else is on our agenda. And then order your fracture prints for the holidays.
[53:00.160 --> 53:01.840]  Great gift idea, but you're running out of time.
[53:04.400 --> 53:08.080]  Anything else on the pixel slate here? I guess the one thing here's the thing that stuck out
[53:08.080 --> 53:18.640]  to me from your review is that the the pixel book is, is probably about as good as a Chromebook
[53:18.640 --> 53:25.440]  could be. I don't have one, but I've seen it is very nice, you know, nice display. It's a nice
[53:25.440 --> 53:33.280]  hardware laptop, it's got a good trackpad, it's got a good keyboard. And it does, if you like
[53:33.280 --> 53:39.600]  Chrome OS, if you want a Chrome system running on a laptop, it's about as good as you could get,
[53:39.600 --> 53:43.040]  you know, I mean, you know, obviously, it's a year old at this point. So there's, you know,
[53:43.040 --> 53:48.160]  some kind of speed bump they could get, which but probably isn't worth it. Like,
[53:48.160 --> 53:55.040]  I don't think it's, it's not just Apple, that sort of is on an irregular update schedule for
[53:55.040 --> 54:01.120]  their laptops based on Intel CPUs. There really is sort of a, like, when I talked to some people
[54:01.120 --> 54:05.680]  at Apple about, well, look, why are the Why did it take so you know, why aren't why doesn't why
[54:05.680 --> 54:09.920]  don't you get a one year update every on everything in the MacBook lineup every year? And they're like,
[54:09.920 --> 54:14.400]  you know, some sometimes, you know, there's just diminishing returns on Moore's law at this point
[54:14.400 --> 54:20.160]  where it's not even worth it. Yeah. But it's really it's it's a great realization of what
[54:20.160 --> 54:27.440]  a Chromebook could be. Whereas the pixel slate is so flawed, right? And to me, it almost is like
[54:27.440 --> 54:34.400]  a mar on the pixel brand. Yep. You know, and the phone and we'll get to it. But the phone is the
[54:34.400 --> 54:39.680]  both phones, the big one and the small one are very, very, very good realizations of what an
[54:39.680 --> 54:46.000]  Android phone can be in 2018. And it's, you know, the pixel brand is a good one. And then they
[54:46.000 --> 54:53.440]  stick this turd out there. Yeah, it's it's it's baffling. And the there, there was a rumor that
[54:53.440 --> 54:57.920]  there was going to be an update to the pixel book that would make it better by making the bezels or
[54:57.920 --> 55:04.480]  on the screen smaller. And I don't know, it, it may have just been, I mean, the rumors came from
[55:04.480 --> 55:08.080]  like these advertisements that were popping up and people would like pixel beat them and be like,
[55:08.080 --> 55:12.720]  this screen is too big. So it may have just been like an overzealous like marketer that was like,
[55:12.720 --> 55:16.080]  I'm gonna make this thing look better and make the screen bigger. But anyway, there were some
[55:16.080 --> 55:20.480]  rumors that they're out there. And if they had done that, and you know, bumped the processor
[55:20.480 --> 55:23.520]  to this year's processor, everyone like, all right, yeah, they made it they made it a little
[55:23.520 --> 55:27.520]  bit better. I would have, you know, said, Oh, they fixed the Bluetooth, you know, a couple of things
[55:27.520 --> 55:32.960]  and everyone, everybody would have been pretty happy. Now, when you put the pixel slate into
[55:32.960 --> 55:38.480]  tablet mode, you can flip the keyboard around, you run into a lot of the same problems. But
[55:39.200 --> 55:44.240]  because it's a laptop that you just use as a tablet, if you want to every now and then, which
[55:44.240 --> 55:47.600]  everybody tells me when I talk to people in the industry, nobody does this, like,
[55:47.600 --> 55:52.640]  when you have a computer with a touchscreen, that you can flip around to the tablet mode,
[55:52.640 --> 55:56.400]  everybody who buys it, it's like, Oh, yeah, this is great. I'm not carrying another tablet,
[55:56.400 --> 56:00.400]  I'm gonna watch movies on it. And then nobody ever does anything except use it as a laptop, right?
[56:00.400 --> 56:04.560]  Right. Right. Because a lot of them have it set up. So you can
[56:07.200 --> 56:11.760]  you can turn it upside down and set it up like a like a TP almost to watch
[56:11.760 --> 56:15.120]  videos. But why would you do that? Why not just watch the video in laptop mode?
[56:16.000 --> 56:20.640]  Right? It's like, does it really mar your movie viewing experience on the plane to have the
[56:20.640 --> 56:25.440]  keyboard in front of you as opposed to having the keyboard behind you in an upside down V?
[56:25.440 --> 56:31.280]  Yeah, I mean, you can you can get a little bit more space to put your weird little, you know,
[56:31.280 --> 56:38.240]  drink and yeah, I guess tray of food there, but whatever. Yeah. But anyway, the when you would
[56:38.240 --> 56:42.720]  the pixel book doesn't do as well in tablet mode, it feels like the pixel slate in a lot of ways.
[56:42.720 --> 56:47.520]  But because nobody ever does that, it doesn't matter as much. Whereas the pixel slate is
[56:47.520 --> 56:51.120]  constantly like, as soon as you detach that keyboard, as soon as you flip that keyboard
[56:51.120 --> 56:54.640]  around, it's like, all right, I'm a tablet now. And it's just so bad at being a tablet.
[56:54.640 --> 56:59.440]  And it drives me crazy. So my son, it's interesting, my son's 14.
[57:00.800 --> 57:07.280]  He had a broken MacBook Pro, like a four year old MacBook Pro, and it eventually gave up the ghost,
[57:07.280 --> 57:12.880]  but it worked, except that I think the internal USB controller was broken. So his keyboard only
[57:12.880 --> 57:18.480]  kind of worked. And his trackpad didn't work at all. Nothing, not even like little. So we had to
[57:18.480 --> 57:24.240]  like plug a mouse into the side to like use the mouse. And he still while we were deciding what
[57:24.240 --> 57:30.000]  to get him as a replacement still used it as his YouTube machine, rather than use his iPad, just
[57:30.000 --> 57:36.320]  because the he just he's just so used to using, you know, the fact that you don't need to stand,
[57:36.320 --> 57:41.200]  right, right and walk around the house. And wherever he sits down, the screen is already
[57:41.200 --> 57:47.920]  propped up. So even without a working trackpad, he still used a MacBook to watch YouTube. And again,
[57:47.920 --> 57:53.200]  you know, for as many hours as he'd be allowed to, rather than use an iPad, just because it's
[57:53.200 --> 57:57.680]  already propped up. I mean, that's how useful the laptop form factor is. I really don't see the need
[57:57.680 --> 58:05.040]  for the bend around backwards thing. Yeah, I guess I would I have it like on an iPad in particular
[58:05.040 --> 58:10.560]  like this. The funny thing is I don't like the new keyboard on the new iPad Pro. Because I do use
[58:10.560 --> 58:15.280]  that flip around thing when I'm on a plane or when I'm like, yeah, lying in bed. I'll like I'll flip
[58:15.280 --> 58:19.840]  it around, then you can get the screen just a little bit closer to your face. And then it just
[58:19.840 --> 58:24.800]  if you don't have to worry about hitting the key or something. And you can't do that with the new
[58:24.800 --> 58:30.800]  keyboard, the old keyboard you could you could put into a sort of just like, like an easel mode
[58:30.800 --> 58:35.280]  or something. Yeah. And the new keyboard, you can't do that. It's either the keyboards flip
[58:35.280 --> 58:40.240]  behind it, or it's sitting there in front of you. And it's I get why they did it. It's better
[58:40.240 --> 58:46.320]  because like it's a little bit stabler on your lap in that mode. Yeah. And it also means I don't
[58:46.320 --> 58:50.720]  know, they could move that smart connector to the back and that, you know, weird place. And there's
[58:50.720 --> 58:54.400]  probably a bunch of reasons why it's better. I'm sure all their, you know, research and all their
[58:54.400 --> 59:00.400]  usability testing say that people prefer it. And I had this weird guilt about not liking it because
[59:00.400 --> 59:06.320]  I spent two years making fun of the original smart keyboard because it had this origami fold. And
[59:06.320 --> 59:10.640]  it was awkward to like fold it up. But it turns out it was actually a pretty good solution.
[59:10.640 --> 59:15.840]  Exactly. I think there's somebody at Apple who came up with it who was like, See, see,
[59:16.960 --> 59:22.320]  I know exactly what you mean. And it was it's like better as a laptop with the new keyboard.
[59:22.320 --> 59:27.520]  But the other one, all the Why is this so funny? And why do you have to fold it and learn how these
[59:27.520 --> 59:32.080]  funny things it was? And why does it have this bulge? And, and now it's like, yeah, I guess I
[59:32.080 --> 59:38.400]  kind of see why is then you could just put this one thing on it and use it everywhere from laptop
[59:38.400 --> 59:44.480]  mode to airplane tray mode, you know. The other thing, here's the other thing about the pixel
[59:44.480 --> 59:51.360]  slate that I found baffling immediately right at the announcement is why in the world are you
[59:51.360 --> 59:59.120]  making people who might buy this choose between this baffling array of CPU options and RAM options
[59:59.120 --> 01:00:09.440]  and all of it? It is mystifying. So they had to go with Intel because Chrome on ARM, there's only
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:14.800]  been one good Chromebook on ARM, in my opinion, the rest of them pretty bad. And, and so they
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:20.080]  wanted to go with Intel. And if you go with Intel, you are stuck with Intel choices. And I think in
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:25.840]  their head, they were like, Alright, well, when people buy other devices, you put them at like
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:30.640]  $100 price breakpoints, and then you just increase the storage. Well, okay, let's do that. Well,
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:34.080]  people don't actually don't care about storage on a Chromebook, they care about processor speed.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:39.600]  And we really want to hit this, you know, $600 price point. Is it six or 700? I think it's $600.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:43.680]  I think it's 599. Yeah, I think the lowest. I think the low maybe it's 699. I don't know.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:50.240]  No, it's 599. And the do not buy that. I mean, don't buy it in general right now until they
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:54.160]  have some of these software problems. I didn't realize they were still making
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:58.480]  Celeron processors. Right? I didn't even realize that was still a thing.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:04.000]  Man, not only are Celeron processors still a thing, they also are increasing the confusion
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.280]  amongst other processors. So the Surface Go that I just bought like a weirdo has this thing called a
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:15.680]  gold processor. I don't even know what that means. And then there's the M3, which if you think M with
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:20.560]  Intel, that usually means oh, it's really slow. But it turns out the new M3s are basically the
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:25.040]  same as the Core i5 and the Core i7y series just with, you know, slightly lower clock speed and
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:29.280]  something, something. And then maybe there's a core difference. I don't know. But anyway,
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.920]  I think they just, they got lost in the weeds of what we want to have $100 breakpoints. So let's
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:40.320]  just pick specs at these $100 breakpoints. But the result is there's five different SKUs. And
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:46.080]  unless you know exactly what you think you're going to do with this thing, picking one is
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:52.720]  impossible. And they should have just said, all right, we'll make the cheap one. And then we'll
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:56.640]  make the nice one. And then we'll make the crazy, we'll make a third one, I guess I'll let you do
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:01.920]  that, that has like super insane specs. And then be done. But to have two in the middle, it's just
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:09.040]  you're getting to put that price point out in the world. But you're doing it in a way that's
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:13.760]  actually going to hurt the Chrome OS brand again. Because just like Windows, Chrome never says no,
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:18.720]  it never stops you from opening the tab, it'll slow it down. Right. So people are going to buy
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:22.480]  this thing. And they're, you know, they're going to think it's going to perform like an iPad.
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:26.080]  And it's just super not. And they're just they're shooting themselves in the face with it.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:32.080]  Right. And to me, RAM options are another one where it's like, man, that is that is the old,
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:36.160]  that is not something people buying this device should be worried about, you know, give them
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:39.680]  enough RAM, and then that's it, then they don't have to worry about it. Because I wrote about
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:45.920]  this, and I got some more negative feedback than I expected. And I should have known it because the
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:53.040]  people who like to configure stuff built to order are, are vocal about it. But I like that the new
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:59.440]  MacBook Air doesn't have any CPU options that you're, there's just one CPU for all the MacBook
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:03.360]  Airs. And there's people who say, well, that's not because it's a good idea. That's because Intel
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:07.920]  only has one chip that meets their thermal specs, you know, there's one chip and one chip only that
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:12.160]  meets them. So if there were more, they'd have a CPU options. And it's like, Oh, maybe because all
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:18.240]  the other Mac books do. But none of Apple's ARM machines have CPU options. They make one chip for
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:24.960]  the model year. And that's it. And it's that chip is good. And, you know, that's it. You don't have
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:29.680]  to worry about it. You pick storage, and that's it. Yeah, it to me, it's delightful. Yeah. And
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:34.560]  for the MacBook Air, just philosophically, like, it's the mass market laptop that most people
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:42.320]  should get, you know, in terms of a Mac, by far. And why not just give them one processor option?
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:49.120]  Like, you know, you buy by offering something up, you get an upsell, I guess, but the upsell is
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:54.560]  there on the MacBook Pro. It's, you know, it's already confusing enough that they've got the
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:59.920]  12 inch, the MacBook Air and the 13 inch MacBook escape all sort of jostling around in the exact
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:05.200]  same like price range, right? If you were to throw on upsells on processor speed on the MacBook Air
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:10.560]  on top of that confusion, nobody would know what to do. Right. And, you know, to me, it's the way
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:16.400]  of the future with the to me, inevitable move to Apple's in house ARM chips for at least for Mac
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:20.400]  books, whether the whole Mac line goes or not, we could do a whole episode on but clearly, they're
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:24.800]  going to make mobile Macs that run on on their own chips. And then I just don't think they're going
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:28.880]  to have CPU options. I think, you know, I don't know if they'll call them a series, maybe they'll
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:36.240]  call them some other letter for the Mac chips, but you know, there'll be the, you know, the M1 chip,
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:40.320]  and that's it. That's the MacBook chip for this year or something like that, you know, maybe the
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:45.920]  MacBook Pro would get its own but so this is a this is a huge rabbit hole. But I just I just got
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:52.000]  to ask, assuming that they're going to move some Macs to arm, I also assume that they are.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:58.480]  What is the software fix going to be? Is it are they just going to like do something like Rosetta?
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:02.800]  Are they gonna just like use marzipan apps and you know, sorry for your luck if you want to tell
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:07.040]  apps I know it's actually not clear to me. No, it won't be the marzipan the marzipan thing is
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:13.120]  is I think a red herring. I don't know, maybe that's the wrong term. I don't think it's related
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:20.640]  to the switch. I think it is entirely just a developer play that that there's a and then you
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:25.680]  know, it is true that there's more iOS developers than Mac developers. And there's an awful lot of
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:31.680]  services that have native iOS apps that don't have native Mac apps. Or if they have a quote,
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:39.280]  native Mac app, it's really just a, you know, web view wrapper. It's not really a Mac app. And it
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:45.920]  those things, it would be better to have the iOS thing running like these marzipan apps. But I have
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:50.800]  a rant, I will get it out soon. I'll get it out before the end of the month. But I think the
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:56.640]  marzipan apps are garbage. I think they're they're some of the worst apps on the Mac. I cannot
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:01.280]  believe Apple shipped them. I really had bought you know, I don't want to waste the whole rant
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:06.160]  here on the show. But I think they're terrible apps. I think it's absolutely baffling. I it's
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:10.560]  crazy that there's a news app and you can't double click a news article to open it in a window.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:16.080]  Like to keep it open like, like, Oh, here's the story I would like to keep open because it's a
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:22.400]  long story. I want to keep reading it but I want to read other articles. No, you're you're limited
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:29.200]  to the user interaction of the phone, like a four inch phone on a 30 inch iMac. It's crazy. It's a
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:33.600]  garbage app. So I don't think that has anything to do with it. And they certainly couldn't say
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:38.080]  marzipan apps only at this point because you know, they only have like these four toy apps.
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:45.360]  Yeah. I the the question is, I think they would do it the same way they did the Intel switch
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:51.520]  announced it at WWDC before there actually is the hardware and Intel developers and say,
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:57.280]  you know, I it's so funny because I watched the video again. And I just I've watched a bunch of
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:03.840]  old Steve Jobs videos recently. Simply because I it occurred to me that we're at the point where
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:10.560]  it's not so sad that he's dead anymore. Right? I don't mean that. That sounds callous. But it's
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:17.520]  like enough time has gone by that it no longer feels like a fresh wound. And I can watch Steve
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:23.920]  Jobs videos now and just enjoy them for what they are. And I watched that one. I watched the one
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:30.560]  where he announced this switch to Intel. And it's so good. It's like five minutes. And it is like he
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:35.760]  conveys so much information. But it's so amazing. I tweeted it. It's like the arguments he gives
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:41.600]  are exactly the arguments that they would give for switching to from Intel to arm. It is entirely
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:49.040]  about not just performance, like he says, like, Look, I we promised you a year or two ago, a g5
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:54.400]  power book. We haven't shipped it, you know, that's on us. It's our fault. That's our fault,
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:57.680]  because we promised it, you know, and he took the totally said, you know, we're Apple, we're the
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:03.840]  ones who said we'd ship it, but we can't because it's not the chip isn't there. And he said, you
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:10.320]  know, we're looking at the power PC roadmap. And we have ideas for some great machines we'd like
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:16.160]  to build. And we can't build those machines with the chips on their roadmap. And it's not just
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:21.280]  about performance, it's about performance per watt. And then there's this chart that shows
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:25.920]  performance per watt. And of course, you know, the Intel chips were had really high bars and the
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:31.600]  power PC had puny little bars, you know, it's like, wow, this is incredible performance per
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:37.440]  watt. That's exactly what they're going to say about switching to arm. It is it is, I swear,
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:42.080]  they could just read, just take the script and just have Phil Schiller say it instead of Steve
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:48.880]  Jobs. It is the exact argument. So I think they announced it at WWDC. Tell developers, you know,
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:54.160]  and here's, you know, Xcode, whatever version number makes it easy. You know, if you've if
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:59.520]  you've been writing independent, you know, Swift is already, you know, everything in Swift is
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:07.120]  already automatically just check a box, and it'll all spit out arm code, your x86 code. If you know,
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:11.200]  you've been, you know, following our guidelines, all of your objective C code will do the same.
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:15.840]  If you do have assembly, you know, you're going to, you know, that's, that's where you're, you
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:19.840]  know, and, you know, it's rare these days that people are writing assembly code, but if you do,
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:26.000]  you know, we've got tools to help you whatever. But we're going to be shipping these next year.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:32.720]  And we will have, you know, some kind of developer hardware in available in the meantime, so that you
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:37.120]  can get your apps running. Yeah, and that'll be it, you know, so I don't think you have to write
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:42.400]  marzipan apps, I think most and I think most modern apps will just literally just recompile.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:47.520]  So the only problem will be the older apps you have that are no longer being maintained,
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:55.120]  but you still use what happens with those. Will there be some kind of emulation and what I've
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:10:01.520]  heard from people who know is that as performant as these apples ARM chips are, for reasons that
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:10.800]  are above my head, emulating x86 code on ARM is slow, that did right, it's it, you know,
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:19.600]  emulating power PC on x86 12 years ago, when they made that transition could fly, like you really
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:24.080]  didn't notice. I mean, if you were using something really, really performance heavy, you might notice
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:29.840]  but regular day to day apps that you would use if you use launch a power PC app with what they call
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:36.560]  it Rosetta was the Yeah, technology. You didn't really notice it was great. I don't think that
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:41.520]  that's possible. But who knows, you know, maybe they've got a genius who can make it happen.
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:47.280]  Yeah, and then I the question is just how many of those legacy apps and what are they?
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:52.560]  And the one that everybody pays attention to, it's the one everybody's paying attention to with,
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:11:00.320]  with the iPad is probably going to be Adobe stuff. And there may be this bizarro world where
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:06.480]  the Adobe stuff ends up not being a problem, because they made a good marzipan app. Right,
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:13.200]  right. If their iPad app gets good enough that you could run it on a Mac and marzipan. No,
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:18.800]  because I know, I know, I'm just saying, right. There's like, if you look at the there's enough,
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:24.160]  like, there's enough Jenga pieces sort of yeah, stacked up here that if you look three years down
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:31.440]  the road, you could see a lot of bizarro things popping out of the switch to arm with with with
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:36.160]  what's going on with Adobe and a few of the pro apps on the iPad. The other thing that jobs did
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:40.720]  that I could see them replaying was he was like, Now, what about Mac OS 10? You know,
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:45.840]  how are we going to get that running on Intel? He goes, Well, let me tell you, it's always been
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:50.320]  running on Intel we've had any like brought up like a Google Earth image of Apple's campus. And
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:54.000]  he like even circled the building. He's like, we've had a team in this building right here,
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:12:01.680]  building every single version of Mac OS 10 for Intel, all the way back to version 10.0 in 2001.
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:08.240]  Yeah. And and then and this is the total jobs in. Oh, my God, of course, he did it. But it was such
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:11.520]  a crowd pleaser. He was like, Oh, by the way, all the demos I've been showing you so far this
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:17.040]  keynote. Yeah, they're all running on this right here. This is an Intel Mac. Like, and you know,
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:21.520]  he was like an hour into the keynote already. Yeah. And I mean, the crowd just went nuts. I
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:25.120]  mean, they just went bananas. And of course, he did that. Of course, the whole thing was running
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:29.920]  on Intel up until then. But when he said it, it was just like, Oh, my God, it's like, I can't
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:36.080]  believe people didn't storm the stage. So I would imagine him doing the same thing again, and just
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:42.640]  saying, Oh, by the way, this whole thing has been running on an ARM Mac. Yeah. Well, I'm excited
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:46.320]  for it. I can't wait. I mean, you know, you've used the air. I reviewed the air. I think it's
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:51.840]  I think it's pretty good. But there's, it just doesn't have could be so much better. Yeah.
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:59.440]  It's it was so funny. It's so I feel for it. Because if I could only have one, if I had to
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:05.440]  go away to desert island for 30 days, and I can only take either the iPad Pro or the new MacBook
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:09.840]  Air, I would take the Mac, because that the Mac is what I need for work. You know, if I only had
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:16.560]  one, I would rather have it. I think it's great. But man, when you just got the new iPad Pro.
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:21.920]  And as frustrating as this over it could be the hardware is so amazing. Yeah, man,
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:26.800]  the MacBook Air just seems like, Oh, my God, why can't I have this in this?
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:36.400]  It feels same way. And you, I feel I bought, of course, the 11 inch iPad Pro,
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:41.200]  even though I had the 12.9 inch for review, my wife absolutely loves it. My wife loves the iPad,
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:47.840]  my wife is prototypical, you know, love uses our iPad way more than every other device phone,
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:53.040]  Mac combined. And just loves the 12.9 inch because if it's your main computer, it's
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:58.480]  fantastic to have that 13 inch size. Me, I just love this tiny little 11 inch thing
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:02.320]  that is so super lightweight. It just feels so amazing to me. Yeah.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:11.200]  Yeah, I have last year's 11. And I don't think I'd go up to the 12. Now, if Apple with iOS 13,
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:18.640]  you know, make some moves, you know, I would, I would think about it pretty seriously, actually.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:24.160]  Oh, I don't know. I would have to be for me probably never, just because I know I'm always
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:29.840]  going to have a Mac until they pry it away from me. But I that's why I like having the secondary
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:36.560]  portable biggish big way bigger than a phone screen. That just is optimized for being crazy
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:46.160]  small and lightweight. Yep. Yep. Where were we? We were we were working our way to the pixel three
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:56.400]  and we went sideways. So the pixel three. Is that your main phone? Yeah, although I'm my sims in an
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:05.360]  iPhone right now, which is fine. I've got an iPhone 10. But I'd say I'm probably like 65 70%
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:12.640]  pixel and, you know, 20 35% iPhone. And which pixel do you have the bigger one or the smaller
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:17.600]  one? So this time around, I went with the smaller one, personally, partially because I didn't want
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:26.400]  to look at the the doofy notch on the pixel three XL. And partly because after using the iPhone 10,
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:30.000]  I just didn't want to go to something that felt oversized.
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:35.520]  Yeah, I can see that I like this. I have the smaller one, I bought the smaller one.
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:43.680]  And I've been using it a fair amount, but I never actually did what I thought I was going to do,
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:49.760]  which is try to just use it as my full time phone for at least two weeks, because I so quickly
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:57.520]  determined that there's just no way I want to use Android. I really, I just don't like it. I think
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:04.320]  this is the best version of it that I've ever seen. And, you know, it is what it is. But there's
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:08.480]  no point to me using it full time. So I'm sort of treating it I bet I've had it with me everywhere.
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:18.080]  I'm sort of just using it as a camera. Yeah. And I love the size. I don't know it to me is actually
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:24.320]  a better size than the iPhone 10. I really, really like the size of this phone. And I like the weight
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:30.080]  it is. Yes, I forget exactly how many grams actually got out my little precision kitchen
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:35.120]  scale. And I know I could look up the tech specs, but I weighed them and it's it is noticeably
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:44.880]  lighter than the iPhone 10. And by 10 I mean 10 and 10 R and 10 s and 10 s max. But it doesn't
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:50.080]  feel like insubstantially light. It feels like Oh, this is the way iPhones used to weigh.
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:57.760]  Yeah, the weirdest craziest thing for me is when I bounced from pixel three back to an iPhone 10.
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:02.160]  The difference here it's it's measured on like, you know, millimeters me it's got to be less than
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:07.520]  10 millimeters of five millimeters is the width. Yeah, the iPhone 10 feels so much wider than the
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:11.200]  pixel three. And when you look at it, it's like, this is basically the same. Yeah, but you just
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:15.600]  there's something about it that you're like, Oh, this is the iPhone 10 is wide. Yeah, there is
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:22.320]  something weird about it. And in the watch world, it's always the case that you cannot, in my opinion,
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:27.280]  in my opinion, it no matter how much of a if you're any level of a watch nerd,
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:31.120]  you have to see a watch in person before you really know if you like it or not. There's just
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:35.520]  absolutely no way to judge a watch from a photograph. Because you can say, well, like,
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:39.600]  I like the style of it. But until you see it in person, you really don't know how big it is.
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:45.520]  And you know how thick it is. And you can see the numbers and you can say, well, I've got a watch
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:51.680]  that's 12.7 millimeters high. And it's not too high. And this one's 13 millimeters. So it's only
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:55.040]  three tenths of a millimeter, that'll be fine. And then you put it on your wrist, and it feels
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:00.480]  like it's a bubble, you know. And it's the same with these phones. It's like, I forget how many
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:04.560]  millimeters, it's just tiny, tiny little bit difference in width. And when you like you said,
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:09.200]  when you eyeball them side by side, they look about the same, but then you put it in your hand,
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:15.440]  and it feels narrower. Yeah, yeah, completely. I don't know. So what is it you don't like about
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:21.760]  Android? It's totally fair. I'm like, there are many things that bug me about Android.
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:29.200]  It is hard to articulate overall. On the surface, there are things that just bugged me because
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:35.520]  they're so obvious. Like, there's no way on the home screen to get most of the apps I use,
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:43.040]  like the app names don't even fit. In like desert golf, it shows up as desert g dot dot dot. I mean,
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:49.120]  that's not a long app name. Now, Instagram, Instagram is, I don't know if you've heard of
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:56.800]  it. It's pretty well known app. I swear to God, I'm not making this up. Instagram on my homepage
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:07.040]  shows up as instagram gra gra dot dot dot. But I swear to God, but the dot dot dot I think is,
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:12.880]  I think it's wider than the M. That is surreal. You must have some like,
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.880]  zoom settings. I don't have the zoom setting. But I do have the font size turned up one click
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:23.600]  because the font is tiny. That's another thing that I don't like. Like, you can turn the font
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:29.760]  size up and it's still is tiny. And they use like on the home screen. They use a compressed font.
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:36.560]  Trenton Larkin Yep. Yeah. It's really, there's little things. There's so many little things like
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:43.600]  that, that just make me crazy. Yeah. So the way that I've dealt with some of that stuff is I set
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:47.680]  up my home screen so that most stuff is in folders. So I actually don't actually, when I look at my
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:54.320]  home screen, I don't see any text at all. I just see rounded icons. Play Store shows up as Play
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:20:05.680]  Stow. Yeah, that's ridiculous. It's a system app. So I don't know, I could go on and on. I don't,
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:14.000]  it just doesn't fit my mental model for how things should work. I don't like Gmail. Although I do
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:19.520]  think they've made the Gmail app a lot better. I've, it's better than I remember it being on
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:24.480]  Android. The Gmail app went through a period of like two, three years, a couple of years ago,
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:31.280]  where they put too much like web view stuff in it. And it was just god awful. It was even worse
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:37.360]  on the iPhone. And so they finally were like, oh, wait, we should, they bought this, this great
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:43.680]  email company called Sparrow. And so they finally, they finally used the tech from Sparrow to like
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:47.760]  fix up the Gmail app, but it took them way too long to get it done. Yeah, the Sparrow guys had
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:53.600]  a good Mac app, right? Or was it an iOS app? I forget. I think they had both. Maybe they had both.
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:21:00.240]  Yeah. No, I remember when they got acquired. That makes sense. You know, and there's other apps,
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:04.800]  you know, Twitter, the actual, if you use the Twitter branded Twitter app, it's, you know,
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:11.840]  more or less the same. So it's okay. Yeah. You know, I could get by, like I've said many,
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:16.160]  many times before, if I had to, if you put a gun to my head and said, you either have to switch to
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:22.320]  Android, but you can keep using a Mac, or you can keep using iPhone, and you have to switch your
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:26.960]  computer to anything else other than the Mac, I would take the Mac and an Android phone, and I'd
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:31.600]  be fine. I mean, I'd be a little I'd be I'd gripe about it. But yeah, I'd be fine. Whereas if you
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:37.280]  took my Mac away, I would feel like I was in handcuffs. Yeah, yeah, I'm able to switch between
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:43.360]  iOS and Android pretty seamlessly. I don't really run into anything. But the reason I could do that
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:50.160]  is I'm pretty militant about turning off iMessage because I need to use Android so often. Yeah. And
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:55.040]  that's, that's the only thing that allows me to do that. Yeah. And I have to say, because I'm and
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:22:00.080]  I know Joanna Stern wrote a column recently about, you know, I think it was specifically when she was
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:07.680]  testing the pixel three about the pain of dropping off the iMessage universe. Yeah. You know, and all
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:14.000]  of a sudden, all your group iMessage things don't work. It's, it's tricky. And the pain of that,
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:18.160]  and I have an alternate SIM, I have a T mobile SIM that I use on the Android, so I could do that.
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:24.720]  And but then I'd still have to carry my iPhone around in case the phone rings. Yeah, you know,
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:28.800]  so and then and then you just use it. It just isn't worth it for me to do it. Because I know
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:36.400]  I just don't like it. I just I just don't. I don't know what else to say. No, it's fair. It's totally
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:40.000]  fair that honestly, I feel like sometimes the only reason I prefer the Android phone is because the
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.800]  home screen lets me put the the icons at the bottom of the screen instead of at the top.
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:50.160]  I did. I kind of like that. I don't really like the home screen on either any of these devices.
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:55.040]  I feel like I feel like nobody's really made a good home screen yet. And I feel like the iOS
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:23:00.880]  one where the apps always fill in top left down. It's kind of crazy that we're in 2018. And it
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:06.400]  still works that way. Especially on the plus size phones. It's like, what? What are you doing? Like,
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:12.240]  everybody? Did you see what Samsung is doing on the next version of the the Galaxy phones?
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:17.440]  No, I don't think so. They're used to be called touchwiz. Never made fun of it. And then they
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:22.480]  changed the name. And now they've got this thing. I think it's called one UI. And what they have
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:29.120]  done is they have made all of the headers on all of their apps, massive. And so literally,
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:32.960]  everything is shifted down to the bottom half of the screen. So like, you open up messages,
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:36.720]  and there's like, the top half of the screen is white space at the word messages. And then you
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:42.240]  can see like three or four of your recent conversations. It's Yeah, I did see screenshots
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:48.720]  to that. And it just so it's like, you can kind of, I mean, maybe I err too heavily on the
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:54.480]  these companies rip off Apple narrative. But you can kind of see where there was a meeting where
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:59.360]  they looked at like iOS 11. And they saw these big headers that Apple started using these big,
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:03.440]  bold headers at the top. And they're like, well, if Apple went that big, what if we went bigger?
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:09.520]  We can go way bigger. We'll beat them. Let's ship this because then we'll be first and they'll be
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:18.160]  forced to copy us and make the font 192 points. And it's, it is kind of funny, too, because
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:22.240]  we've reached this world where everybody is sort of like, yeah, I guess the whole world does want,
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:27.440]  you know, five inches phones, you know, yeah, because you can pack more stuff on them. And then
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:33.280]  they they've reduced like the usable size down to like where we were years ago. Well, it's it's
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:38.800]  the same thing as everybody copying the notch, right? It's like it actually justify it before
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:42.800]  you throw that thing on there. Because it does like it does look silly. And we've convinced
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:47.440]  ourselves that it doesn't but it just does. What do you think on the pixel three? So I have the
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:54.720]  smaller one, too. And there's no notch. It just instead has symmetrical chin and forehead. But
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:25:00.720]  they're small, smaller than in the old days, and I'm fine with it. But they rounded the corners off
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:06.640]  on the display. And there's something about the way that they rounded the corners off that I can't
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:11.280]  put my finger on. And I don't it's like that there's not enough of an inset for like the
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:19.280]  icons up in the in the in the top row. Yeah. If you want to hate your pixel forever, turn it off,
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:25.760]  and then turn it on and stare at the corners where they rounded off and you will see that they
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:30.560]  it it's actually bigger than what they round off and then they in software rounded a little bit
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:35.840]  smaller, more so it's not the elegant way that you know, the red or what's the liquid retina,
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:41.600]  the liquid retina that Apple does? It's just they like, this doesn't quite match. And so they just
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:44.880]  rounded a little bit more just for the heck of it. But the screen is still sitting there,
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:49.200]  able to show pixels, but they just they just cut it off to like get a different
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:54.000]  different corner on it. Oh, I just did what you said. And I see what you mean. Yeah. Oh,
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.680]  why won't they just let me have that? Oh, my God is the corners are so much better. Oh, there it
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:08.000]  goes. It is funny. You know, what's funny about this, this device shipping so soon after the
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.280]  quote unquote liquid retina did is that Apple spent time talking about how much effort they
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:22.080]  put into getting the corners right on the LCD of the iPhone XR. And I guess this is an OLED,
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:27.600]  this isn't LCD. But you know, it's still getting these round corners is, you know,
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:32.320]  there's work to be done. And I know it need I didn't need I break out a microscope with
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:36.080]  10 are just to show, you know, and it's even more detailed than you think, like,
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:42.720]  literally at the microscopic level. Yeah. That's how, you know, the effort Apple put into getting
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:47.360]  those round corners, right. And then here's what happens if you don't put that level of effort into
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:54.000]  it. It just feels crowded. For some reason, it is a much bigger phone than I ever thought I would
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.200]  like. And I you know, it is a very large screen. But yet because of the way they rounded the
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:04.880]  corners. I'm constantly thinking it feels a little cramped. Yeah, yeah. Let me add this Dieter.
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:09.920]  Here's another thing I absolutely despise about Android and could I'll just never ever, ever,
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:15.760]  ever get used to it is the the way that notifications get icons up there in the
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:20.560]  in the status bar. Oh, you don't like looking at the little I can't I can't stand it. I can't
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:24.800]  stand the way that if you've got three from Instagram, you've got three instagrams up there
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:29.040]  in the status bar. I don't want any of them in the status bar. And I don't think you can turn it off.
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:34.640]  I mean, I think you can do do not disturb. But yeah, you might be right that you can't turn it
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:40.720]  off. I don't mind them. I kind of I kind of like seeing what they're up there. My my my gripe goes
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:46.800]  the other way like the status bar is annoying. Sure. But the the information density on iPhone
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:52.320]  notifications with those big cloudy bubbles, I they fixed it a little bit with iOS 12. But
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:56.720]  the speed with which I can go through notifications on Android, it's it's literally
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:01.200]  three times faster than what I can do on an iPhone, I can, I can pull that thing down,
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:04.400]  see everything sort of stacked and grouped together, swipe away the stuff I don't want
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:10.880]  act on the stuff I want. Whereas with the iPhone, they just feel just way more onerous to me in some
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:18.240]  way. See, and I love the iPhone ones. But now that they've added, like I feel like now I maybe
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:24.000]  only with iOS 12. I feel like I finally am happy with iOS notifications. But I totally get your
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:29.760]  take on this. Like I don't I don't I don't think I Android's notification thing is bad. I just don't
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:34.880]  like it. Yeah, I hate the way that you can swipe things this either way. And it does the same thing
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:40.160]  like, I don't know why. And because in some ways, I kind of see how it shouldn't matter whether you
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:45.120]  swipe left or right, because there's nothing semantic that says, you know, dismiss one way,
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:50.560]  take action the other, right? There's no natural way to swipe. So why not be able to swipe both
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:59.520]  ways? Yeah. And I so I think that's less of a objective criticism and more of a I natively
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:06.240]  think in iOS idioms. And therefore, this feels foreign to me. Like, I don't think it's a bad
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:11.760]  design. In fact, I can kind of see how it's actually a good design because if you're just
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:15.360]  swiping off, it shouldn't matter whether it's left, right. But yeah, there's me
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:20.000]  Yeah. And this is the exact same problem, but in the opposite direction. So the thing I most want
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.880]  to do with most notifications is swipe them to make them go away. Just just dismiss them. And
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:30.800]  the fact that on iOS, you can't, it's always two actions to just dismiss a notification,
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:35.520]  you it's a swipe and a tap or like you it's a swipe to open. But if you just want the thing
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:41.440]  to just go away. You can't do that. You got to swipe in the tap clear. No, you can swipe it all
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:49.680]  the way and it'll go away. Which direction do you swipe it left or right? swipe it to the left. Oh,
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:54.800]  if you and then if you keep if you Okay. But if you do a quick swipe, it opens up the buttons,
[01:29:54.800 --> 01:30:01.200]  but you have to do a slow swipe, right? Then it goes away. See, that's crazy town. Okay. Yeah.
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:08.560]  And it is kind of crazy. Anyway, but I like it. I Well, I'm used to it, I will say right. And I
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:16.400]  do kind of feel honestly, I'll just say I think iOS is notification, our system is simpler,
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:24.240]  and therefore more serious to my dumb mind. Like the density of the of the Android one
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:29.760]  makes me feel like I'm a little bit under attack. Oh, for sure. The the iOS notifications
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:35.440]  are like, they're like a lower cognitive load. It's not about a dumb mind. It's that there's
[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:39.760]  there's less to think about when you're looking at them for sure. And so I appreciate that,
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:51.040]  because I need a I need a lower cognitive load. Another thing hardware wise, I then to me,
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:56.480]  this is baffling is why in the world did Google take this phone, which is otherwise so nice.
[01:30:56.480 --> 01:31:02.560]  It really is the nicest hardware I've seen on any phone other than an Apple phone. It is a very nice
[01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:09.920]  object in my hand. The buttons are nice. I didn't have the pixel to I had the pixel one and the
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:15.520]  pixel one did a thing where they they put like an etching on the power button. Right. And I never
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:21.280]  liked that. I was like, Why would you just does not feel like a nice button. It feels like feels
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:26.880]  industrial feels like something in the shop, you know, metal working thing. It just does not feel
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:31.840]  appropriate. So you know, I don't know why they did that. The buttons on this device very, very
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:37.760]  nice. I'm not a fan of volume buttons that are a single rocker. I like to have volume up and volume
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:46.080]  down, but I'm okay with it. It's a nice feeling volume, but it has a smaller camera bump than the
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:52.160]  iPhone. So it put aside the single lens versus dual lens. It's just it just in and of itself,
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:32:00.480]  a smaller camera bump is inherently a good thing if image quality is maintained. Yeah. And we can
[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:05.440]  we can go on a whole separate rant later about, you know, photography on the pixel three,
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:11.520]  but inarguably, the pixel three takes good pictures for a cell phone, very good pictures
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:17.120]  for a cell phone. So the fact that it does it with a smaller camera bump is a good thing.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:21.520]  But why in the world did they do this laser etching thing on the glass on the back?
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:28.960]  What this photographs do not do justice to this, what they've done to the glass,
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:36.800]  it you can't you have to feel it to understand it. And it is a to me it is not pleasant to the
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:44.720]  touch. It is it is not pleasant. At times, sometimes depending on the texture of my skin,
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:49.440]  and we're at that time of the year on the East Coast where my my hands will go from dry to
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:56.000]  sweaty, you know, because I've, I've got gloves on, and my hands get real sweaty. Or I've, you
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.080]  know, it's just cold and I don't have gloves on and my hands get real dry, you know, so my hands
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:05.600]  are all over the place skin wise. And there are times when it has plenty of grip, but there are
[01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:11.600]  times when it is the slipperiest goddamn phone I've ever owned in my life. Yeah, no, Dan Siefert,
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:16.000]  reviews editor at The Verge, he he just goes off on this because this phone does it and then
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:23.360]  OnePlus phones do it. And I don't know, man, like the this like window shade thing they call it
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:28.560]  where the top is glossy and the bottom is matte has been like the identifying feature of Pixel
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:32.880]  phones for a while if they just made it glossy glass people would have assumed it was a Samsung.
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:40.080]  But you can see what the glossy glass part feels great and looks great. And it's obviously what
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:46.160]  the glass started at before they laser etched it. So it could have just been the glossy back.
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:51.760]  And it would have looked like the jet black iPhone seven, except glass, or they could have etched it
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:56.480]  on the inside so that it's still like that, like some kind of color two tone thing that they want
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:03.120]  to have. Right. The other thing that caused so every phone that comes out every flagship phone
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:06.800]  that people pay attention to always has a bunch of gates, like what are the problems with it.
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:12.880]  And the the pixel has had more than its fair share. And some of them are pretty bad. We've
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:18.800]  written about a few of them, but not I haven't actually experienced most of them. So there was
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:24.480]  there's an issue where like pictures don't save. There's a couple other software things that are
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:31.120]  just kind of inexcusable. But the the one at launch was the question of whether or not this
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:38.800]  etched glass scratches more easily than the glossy part of the glass. Because if you take a key and
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:43.920]  rub it up against the phone, it is the most terrifying thing you've ever seen. Because it's
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:49.840]  just you get these massive things that look like horrific gashes. But it turns out what's happening
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:54.400]  is it's pretty hard glass. And so it's actually you know, it's just like you're you're filling it
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:59.760]  in with the metal and then you can rub it off. And so people did a bunch of videos showing that and
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:04.480]  then there was a YouTube fight and blah. But at the end of the day, I do think this thing scratches
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:09.360]  like I've got scratches on this thing that I don't think I would have had otherwise. And it's not
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:14.240]  because I was like taking a diamond to it. I think it does just scratch a little bit more easily than
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:21.680]  it should. That it's it's like you can it's a sign to me of and and again, I think that the
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:26.720]  the pixel hardware team is doing great work and and I get so frustrated when I see articles
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:31.280]  like why does why does Google even bother with hardware? They're you know, they're pixels never
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:36.160]  going to amount to anything in the world in terms of market share, blah, blah, blah. And it's like,
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:40.960]  if you're only going to get into hardware, if you have 20% market share or something like that,
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:46.080]  it's there's only going to be three hardware makers, right? I think it's a great I think
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:50.560]  it's great that Google is doing hardware. I think it's great that Microsoft is doing hardware
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:58.720]  regardless of whether they are industry Titans in terms of market share or not. I think it's
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:03.840]  really good for the companies. I think it's really good for their ecosystems. And you know, and the
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:10.640]  companies are full of clever people. This hardware overall is very, very good. But I think it's very
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:18.000]  clear that they're like, just 1015 years behind Apple in certain ways. And one of them is like,
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:26.320]  Apple made the same mistake. 15 years ago, there was an iPod nano. Yes. That was made of
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:32.960]  looking at crosswise, just right. You could actually scratch it by staring at it hard enough,
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:39.600]  like a good hard stare. And it would scratch the the polycarbonate whatever the material was
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:46.080]  of this of this iPod nano. And I remember, I didn't have one right away. But I did get one
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:50.480]  fairly quickly. But I remember people were putting videos up and I thought it was like a gag. People
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:55.360]  were like, Look, if you just put it, here's my keys. Here's the iPod. And look, it has like,
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:59.360]  here's two scratches on it. Right. All right. I put it in my pocket. I jump around a little I take
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:03.520]  it out. Now there's four scratches. I was like, Oh, that can't be. It was like, Oh, yeah, actually.
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:08.160]  That's how easily it's scratched like that is that is literally the test we did with the pixel three
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:14.320]  for our review and the same thing happened. And, you know, so I just feel like you you wind up
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:20.640]  building a company winds up building like a checklist after after a thing like that. And no
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:26.400]  product ever comes out again that doesn't go through. Put it in a pair of jeans with with a
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:33.360]  regular pair of keys and see what happens. The thing to watch with Google hardware on the phones
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:40.000]  phones is next year's pixel, because this year, you know, they used to Nexus phones and they were
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.960]  basically they'd work with some company like Samsung or HTC or Huawei and make it. But they
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:51.920]  bought HTC phone division a year and a half ago, two years ago. And so this hardware is good. And
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:57.200]  it is Google made hardware. You know, they did design it top to bottom, blah, blah, blah. So
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:01.200]  it's not like those old the first pixel phone or the old Nexus phones were really it was technically
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:09.040]  like a Huawei phone or whatever. But it takes a minute to integrate a whole damn company that you
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:14.240]  bought into your systems and into your processes and into your product roadmap. And so I think
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:20.640]  that next year's pixel will be the first phone hardware from Google that actually takes full
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:25.840]  advantage of the fact that they bought a phone company. Well, and not just a phone company. HTC
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:33.840]  was a for a while was a really good phone company like their fall from the top tier of Android
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:40.320]  hand makers was kind of baffling. Because you know, and it was funny because I don't know how
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:44.720]  I remember this because I wasn't really I'd never really cared about Windows Phone. But back when
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:49.360]  Windows Phone was a thing HTC was far and away the number one Windows Phone maker. Yeah. And I
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:54.640]  thought it was a testimony to the the it was a real feather in the cap of the company that they
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:39:00.320]  pivoted, you know, because it's really easy to when you're number one at something to stay in it,
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:04.080]  and then you turn around and realize that you're on this Windows Phone boat and you've
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:12.000]  you've you know, you're on the beach. The boat isn't even in the ocean anymore. It's like, Oh,
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:17.760]  how did we get here? Like they sidestep from being the number one Windows Phone maker to being a top
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:24.000]  or maybe for a while the top Android handset maker really well, I thought that that was a sign that
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.520]  boy, that's a that's a well run company. That is, you know, is, you know, keeping their eyes on the
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:33.280]  horizon, not just looking down at what they're doing right now. And then all of a sudden,
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:37.920]  they're gone. Yeah, well, so I mean, they've been they made the very first Android phone,
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:44.480]  the G one. And they made a bunch of really good Android phones later. And they were really good
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:51.040]  with materials. But they were never great with cameras. And they were mediocre at software. But
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:55.760]  the thing that they didn't have was Samsung's marketing budget. Right. And like, that's,
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:00.080]  that's kind of the whole story is that with a lot of Android manufacturers, especially in the West
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:06.000]  is nobody can compete with, with Samsung and marketing and Samsung was good enough on high
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:11.600]  end quality that, you know, if you walk into a carrier store, which is what everybody did
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:16.320]  back in the day to buy a phone, they would just push you to Samsung. And that was the end of it.
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:24.880]  Yeah, yeah, that's that makes sense. The other thing I like I bought the the Google I don't know,
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:32.080]  I you I know from your tweet where you showed the unfortunate scratch on your your pixel three that
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:37.920]  you don't you weren't using a case at least but I bought the Google case. The one with the cloth
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:45.680]  fabric cloth one. Yeah, I I'm not a case person, but I'm trying to be just because I don't know
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:52.400]  why because I know not I feel it feels strange to me that I don't use an iPhone case 95% of the time,
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:58.080]  but 95% of the people use 100% of the time like they buy it. They the only time they ever touch
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:03.680]  it without a case is when they take it out of the box after unboxing it and putting it under the
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:10.320]  case. You know, and people are you know, they're very expensive devices that are easily broken
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:15.840]  when dropped. And so I understand that. But you know, it seems to me like most people treat it
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:20.960]  like a like the way you like a heart surgeon treats that the heart as they move it from the
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:26.880]  icebox into the transplanted patient, you know, like, yeah, until they get that iPhone into a case
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:31.280]  they they're there. They act like they're treating handling a raw egg or something.
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:40.320]  But I'm trying it. I like this Google case. It is a very nice case. And I've tried I've wasted an
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:44.640]  unbelievable amount of money on iPhone cases recently as I tried to find one that I can kind
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:49.920]  of stand. And I would say it's up there with the very best iPhone cases I've seen. It's a really
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:56.320]  nice case. Yeah, I am. It's it's just a tad thick for me. Yeah, but nobody nobody's made a good thin
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:02.640]  case for the pixel three yet. So that's one of the reasons I'm not using a case. But yeah, like,
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:07.280]  everybody at the New York office at the verge who has a pixel swears by that that cloth case,
[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:11.840]  they all love it. I like it. And I kind of wish it was available for iPhone because the thing I
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:16.320]  like I do like having an iPhone case for and I keep one in my backpack, but I like it when I'm
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:21.040]  like on vacation, or we go to Disney World or something like that. And when I'm using my phone
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:25.440]  as a camera most of the time, so I'm on vacation, and I'm in tourist mode, and I'm taking lots of
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:31.520]  snapshots. I like having a case for grippiness. Because when I'm using my phone, when I'm, you
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:35.920]  know, doing, you know, Twitter and email and stuff like that, I never feel like I'm going to drop it.
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:41.040]  It's the times, you know, I've had very few drops over the years. But the times when I feel like
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:47.520]  it's the most precarious is when I'm photographing things. So I like having the grip of a somewhat
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:51.680]  grippy case. And I like the idea that if I do drop it, and it's in a case, it's, you know,
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:58.080]  less likely to come to harm. This case to me is like the cloth is really nice for grippiness,
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:01.680]  because it's not sticky at all. So there's no friction going in and out of the pocket.
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:05.520]  But if you have like, if your hands are sweating, because it's hot or something like that.
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:08.800]  It's like the perfect texture. Yeah.
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:15.040]  Yeah, honestly, the reason I don't like it is hitting the fingerprint sensor on the back.
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:20.480]  There's just like an extra little angle that drives me crazy, which is silly, but there it is.
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:25.200]  Well, and I will tell you, as I tell you also why I can't really bear to use this as my main phone,
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:30.000]  I cannot go back not to having face ID. That's another factor. Yeah. And I kind of knew that
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:38.240]  going in. Because back in June, when iOS 12 betas came out, I my habit for years has been never to
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:44.240]  don't don't put the betas on my main phone until at least late in the summer. This year,
[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:48.480]  I kind of did it early. And I know lots and lots of other people who did notice that iOS 12 was
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:53.600]  an unusually stable beta throughout the whole summer, even beta one, it was like the most stable
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:44:00.000]  WWDC beta ever. So hats off to everybody who worked on that. But when I when I got home from
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:07.040]  WWDC, I wanted to put the first beta on my iPhone eight, and, you know, put it on and I was like,
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:11.840]  All right, now I put my sim in there, I'm going to use this as my main phone as I get used to iOS 12.
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:17.360]  And like an hour later, after the 10th time of just staring at it, and like, Hey,
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:22.080]  why isn't this unlocking? I was like, I can't use this. I, you know, took I spent more time
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:27.440]  installing the beta on it than I did actually using it before I realized I'm ruined forever.
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:34.080]  Yeah. And I have to say that having a fingerprint sensor on the back, it's not horrible. But it's
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:38.960]  not. It's like a separate thing, right? Because you can't unlock. Well, you can unlock the phone
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:43.440]  with it. But when you're dealing with notifications on the notification screen, it's it's an entirely
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:49.840]  different thing. Yeah, well, and also, like, you just have to pick it up. So there's little just
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:53.280]  like, if it's sitting in a charging stand or something, and you want to unlock it in without
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:56.960]  taking it off the charging stand, you know, you can't, you got to like, tilt it forward,
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:02.160]  you got to punch in the code. And that's super frustrating. Yeah. And I the thing. I'm sure
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:07.360]  people who listen to my show are mostly all on iPhone 10 already. Well, not mostly I know, you
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:15.440]  know, I majority I'm sure are, you know, surprise, surprise, it's an early adopter crowd. But for
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:20.320]  those who aren't, and I know that there's like a natural skepticism of people who like or even
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:26.640]  love touch ID, who are just so skeptical about switching, you know that that the that the new
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:32.320]  way forward from the iPhone 10 forward is not touch ID plus face ID, it's you've touched away
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:37.280]  touch ID is gone. Now you have face ID. The thing I can't emphasize enough is that once you get
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:42.160]  used to it, it's like your phone isn't locked at all, right? You just pick it up. And it's
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:47.840]  raised awake, or tap to wake, right? You just tap it if you need to. And then you see a notification.
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:52.160]  And you're like, Oh, I would love to read that news story. I this headline is very enticing. And
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:56.880]  you just, you know, open the notification. And now you're reading the article. It was like you
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:02.160]  never even thought about the unlock part. It's and going back to something where it's like, ah,
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:06.880]  I got to stick a finger on that hole in the back of the phone. It's just an irritation every single
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:13.680]  time. Yeah, totally. It totally is. And I don't know when they're gonna, if they're gonna switch
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:19.680]  the the in screen fingerprint sensors that are out there are pretty slow, relative to what you
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:24.160]  can get if you just have a separate one. So maybe they can switch to something like face ID. I'd
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:30.160]  like them to, but you know, Apple probably has got that thing. patted up the wazoo. I wonder though,
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:34.720]  because I mean, you know, Apple was first with the touch. Well, I didn't know they weren't the
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:39.120]  first fingerprint sensor, but they were the first good fingerprint sensor. And now everybody's got
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:43.680]  a good fingerprint sensor. Yeah. So and there's Windows Hello. So you can, you know, like,
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:50.560]  right on a Windows laptop that they support it, and that uses an infrared camera. So yeah,
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:55.920]  maybe it's maybe they could do. It's the sort of thing where, you know, it's easy for me to say,
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:02.240]  because my name isn't on the face ID patent. But it's the sort of thing that as a generally,
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:09.840]  you know, not someone who's not generally a fan of software patents. It's the sort of
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:14.240]  thing that I hope isn't hindered by patents, because it's so clearly the right way to go.
[01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:18.160]  Yeah. So do you want to hear my conspiracy theory? Yes, I love conspiracy theory. The
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:25.440]  pixel three has one camera on the back and two on the front, right. And the two on the front
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:30.560]  are there because they one of them is a wide angle thing. And they also do actually use a little bit
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:35.920]  of it for portrait mode stuff. But the idea is mainly people love having wide angle selfies.
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:41.200]  And it's easy to poo poo that but like, actually like handing it to a normal person and then be
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:46.720]  like, look, you can get it this way. They love it. My conspiracy theory is that Google wanted
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:51.120]  to do the same thing with face unlock that Apple is doing a face ID but be able to claim that it
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:56.720]  was as secure as face ID without having to use lasers because they are able to do with two
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:01.120]  cameras, detect your face accurately in the same way that they don't need two cameras to do
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:04.720]  portrait mode on the back, if that makes sense. They're so good at applying machine learning to
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:10.000]  what the camera sees, that they could have a secure face unlock with the selfie cameras.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:15.040]  I'm sure this isn't true. But it's my crazy conspiracy theory informed by absolutely no
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:22.880]  sources or hints from anywhere. That makes that does make some sense. It's funny, I've, you know,
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:28.080]  and like I said, I've been using the pixel three mostly as a camera for at least a month. I'm just
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:36.400]  not a big selfie taker. So I've tried, you know, and I do see it, I see how from and you know, and
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:44.240]  it is optimized for arm's length. It is it is it is very useful if you're the sort of person
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:49.440]  who takes a lot of pictures of themselves in it and wants to see the background or
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:54.320]  takes a picture of yourself with friends and family right next to you. It it does exactly
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:49:00.240]  what Google says it does. You know, it is a good camera for getting more people in from exactly the
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:08.480]  length of of holding the camera out at arm's length. Well, it's a weird focal length at all
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:13.920]  sorts of other areas in the way that white super wide angle fisheye. I mean, I wouldn't quite call
[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:18.880]  it a fisheye lens, but it's close because it's so wide. And there's all sorts of stuff that looks
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:23.760]  bad if you get it at the wrong distance. But it's, you know, it's surprise, surprise optimized for
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:29.680]  arm's length. It is weird, though, that they have two pictures on the to me, the lesser side,
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:35.280]  not the greater side. I mean, two cameras on the lesser side. Well, I think that I mean,
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:42.240]  it's weird to me as well. But I'm also not a millennial. Right? I mean, it's easy to make
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:46.160]  jokes about millennials. But I do think that in a lot of ways, the selfie camera is the most
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:51.040]  important camera on a lot of phones. And like, and I make say that with no judgment, like, it's
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:50:00.400]  right. You know, I've even budged. I went a long time. I used to be my other pet peeve years ago.
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:04.480]  Nobody even talks about blogs anymore, period. But for a long time, in the early years of
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:09.840]  Daring Fireball, I went out of my way to always use the word web blog instead of blog. Because
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:14.800]  for some reason, I really, I thought, I still don't like the word. I think that it's, I don't
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:21.440]  know, there's something about the word that I don't like. Yeah. But I went out of my way for
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:27.120]  a long time to not use the word selfie. I still do sometimes I will use there's a lot of places
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:33.360]  in Daring Fireball where I will use the term self portrait, where everybody else in the 20th,
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:40.800]  21st century would use the word selfie. Yeah. You know, I feel like if even Apple calls them
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:45.120]  selfies, and you know, every time Phil Schiller says the word selfie, it always sticks out to me
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:49.600]  because he always seems to me like the sort of person who, if he's using the word selfie,
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:54.640]  then I should be using it to it's given up. That's it's a word, you know, language evolves,
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:56.480]  and that it is what it is. But
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:00.960]  well, I think I think everybody needs to have their one language thing that they refuse to
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:05.120]  judge on. For me, it's beg the question when people say beg the question and then like,
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:09.200]  actually state a question when really, when they misuse the phrase beg the question. That's that's
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:18.640]  the one that I get perspective about. I I'm big on people who say that they're nauseous.
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:25.200]  When they mean that they're nauseated. Because something that is nauseous is what makes you
[01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:34.400]  nauseated. Right? Like a nauseous odor makes you feel nauseated. Right. And I'm correct on that.
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:41.840]  But in general, unless I try to be as much of a descriptivist rather than prescriptive as the
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:47.760]  language evolves, and it's, you know, using nauseous to mean nauseated is so common that
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:54.400]  it's actually accepted in some places. Right. But it's, it's one to me that every time somebody
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:59.920]  says it, I always think that's wrong. Yeah. To bite my tongue and not correct them,
[01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:04.800]  or go on the rant that I just did right there. All right, let me take a final break here and
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:12.400]  thank our third and final sponsor of this show. So good friends at Casper. Casper products
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:16.640]  are cleverly designed to mimic human curves, providing supportive comfort for all kinds of
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:23.760]  bodies. They make mattresses, they make sheets, they make pillows. It's a sleep company. Bottom
[01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:27.920]  line. And they're experts. They're engineers. They're again, this isn't like a white label
[01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:32.480]  thing where there's some company making mattresses and then Casper just brands them and puts a Casper
[01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:36.960]  sticker on them. They're there. They're literally they have sleep engineers. I know it sounds like
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:41.520]  a joke, but they've got like, serious engineering team that makes these mattresses. They're,
[01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:48.400]  they're all custom designed. They're made right here in the United States. And they work on,
[01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:54.320]  on things like breathability, so that you sleep cool, and your body temperature stays consistent
[01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:59.120]  through the whole night. It's a big deal. You get too hot, you get too cold, you're gonna wake up,
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:06.000]  you're not gonna have a good night's sleep. They offer the regular mattress, which is great. That
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.920]  used to be the only one they have. But they've got two other mattresses now the wave and the essential
[01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:15.120]  the wave features their patent pending premium support system to mirror the natural shape of
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:19.600]  your body. That's their it's their premium mattress. That's what they're trying to say
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:24.800]  there. And the essential has a streamlined design at a price that won't keep you up at night. They
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:29.040]  say that's their way of saying it's the lower price one, but it's great. It is a terrific
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:34.960]  mattress. They don't have a bad mattress. And they have a wider array of other products. I've told
[01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:39.520]  you they pillows, sheets, all sorts of stuff like that. And it's all designed, developed and
[01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:45.040]  assembled right here in the United States. Now, here's the thing, their prices are so much lower
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:48.160]  than what you see in a mattress store because they cut out the middleman there is no mattress
[01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:54.480]  store with Casper, you buy from them, they make it, they ship it to you. And their shipping costs
[01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:59.280]  are lower because they're there. They ship them in these amazingly small boxes, because they're
[01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:03.600]  foam mattresses. You just can't believe you buy like a queen size mattress, you just cannot believe
[01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:07.600]  the box that it comes in. It's just unbelievable how small it is. Half the reason to buy one is
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:13.520]  just the fun of opening one up. It really is fun. But that means you don't get to try it before you
[01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:19.200]  buy. But guess what, they have 100 night risk free sleep on at trial. That's over three months. So
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:26.080]  buy one, try it out. Three months later, you're not satisfied. No questions asked, they will take
[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:30.000]  it back. And I've had readers say to me, you know, I did this and I thought it was gonna be a
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:34.000]  nightmare like sending your cable box back and they're gonna try to, you know, you know, talk
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.160]  you out of it. They're like, Oh, no problem. When when can we pick it up? It's it could not be
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:42.480]  easier. That's how confident they are and how few people actually take them up on that offer. But
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:46.400]  you can you don't have to worry about it. So here's the special offer they've got for you.
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:56.240]  50 bucks towards select mattresses by visiting Casper, casp, er.com slash talk show. That's
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:55:02.400]  just slash talk show at casper.com. And remember that same code talk show at checkout and you can
[01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:08.480]  save 50 bucks on select mattresses, terms and conditions to apply.
[01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:15.200]  I still sell the pillow. I think so. Yeah, they have pillows. Yeah, yeah, there it is. Yep. I
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:21.440]  use it. Love it. I have one. I love it. Another sometimes sponsor of the show is hello, who sells
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:28.000]  these buckwheat pillows that my wife and son adore. Yeah, absolutely adore. I don't I like it.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:32.400]  You know, I'm not going to speak poorly of them as a former sponsor of the show. My wife and son
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:37.280]  love I like the just the sort of regular pillow that the Casper makes. It's just like a like a
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:41.600]  pillow pillow. Yep. And it's easy to wash. That's why I bought it because you could take it apart
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:47.120]  and throw it in the machine. Yeah, it is. It is, you know, and it's like brand new. Like mine's
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:51.760]  at least a year old. It's and it's been washed several times. And it's, I'm a drooler when I
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:56:00.800]  sleep so I don't know that's too much information. I need washability. All right, pixel three camera.
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:07.440]  It is an excellent camera. But before I get to the camera, I have to say this. Here's the other thing
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:11.680]  about the pixel three that I just as an iPhone user, I cannot believe I can't believe what a
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:19.280]  shitty screen it has. And I cannot believe the default setting for the display. I cannot believe
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:25.920]  it. There's the which of the one does it default to default to the super adaptive adaptive. So so
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:32.400]  in you go to settings, display and then you have to go to advanced so you don't even know if you're
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:37.120]  just a typical user and you think advanced I you know, that's that's not for me. You would never
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:42.000]  even know the setting is there you go to advanced and then there's what do they call it here?
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:47.600]  colors. They have three options natural boosted and adaptive and they have a photo of like a
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:53.040]  hummingbird and some flowers to show you what these three mean but there's no text describing
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:57:00.320]  what what the difference is. The default is the last one adaptive. And I think it's crazy. I
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:04.800]  don't know what the hell there's I don't know what it's adapting to other than making everything look
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:11.120]  bad. It is so super saturated. I have no idea why they don't call that one boosted like the
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:19.600]  even the terms they use are wrong. Yeah. Okay, so natural is supposed to be straight RGB or s RGB,
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:26.320]  right? boosted is supposed to be straight s RGB, but they boost it like 10%. And then adaptive
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:32.720]  is adaptive to the colors on the screen where they make stuff super vivid, but they try to
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:39.440]  be intelligent about not boosting skin tone so that they look Donald Trumpy. It is they fail at
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:45.040]  that every well everything looks red. Yeah, everything looks red. So the the history here
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:51.440]  and I in particular a part of this history is is fascinating. So number one, the context to know
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:56.000]  and by the way, none of this is like an apology. None of this is saying that these are the right
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:59.840]  decisions. I'm just like the cop. I'm trying to explain the decisions I think they've made.
[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:03.920]  So number one is if you look at any other Android phone and especially a Samsung phone,
[01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:09.920]  it makes the even the the adaptive super vivid mode on the pixel three
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:14.960]  look washed out and muted. It is the most insane colors you've ever seen on a screen in your entire
[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:20.160]  life. Then Samsung has always tuned its colors that way. And so I think that there is a context
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:25.920]  for in the Android world where if they don't have the default presentation of the screen be bonkers,
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:30.480]  then people will think it looks washed out in the store relative to a Samsung phone in the same way
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:35.120]  that like all the wrong settings are on on the TVs at Best Buy. Right. Right. And it's it's like
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:38.800]  a blue state red state America where it's like, you know, there's parts of the country where it's
[01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:44.000]  totally, you know, very typical to have like 10 guns in your house and other parts of the country
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:48.240]  where it's like, it's shocking if you own a gun. Yeah. And it's like, wow, what a difference,
[01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:52.880]  you know, and it's like, we've sort of gotten like, that's, it's not political. It's obviously
[01:58:52.880 --> 01:59:00.800]  as the aesthetic. But Apple adheres to this very, very, very to me, absolutely pristine
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:08.880]  color space that is realistic. And yeah, and not really. Just almost with scientific, literally,
[01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:13.600]  maybe not even almost like with scientific rigor trying to be realistic. And yeah, Samsung and
[01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:21.440]  other Android makers have pushed the Android world to this vivid nightmare. Yep. Yep. And that leads
[01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:26.960]  me to the second part of the context, which was last year's pixel to the XL had such a terrible,
[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:32.960]  horrific screen that they are probably overcompensating with the way that they handle
[01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:36.560]  reds in particular on the screen. So we actually pulled our review for a while cause we were
[01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:41.920]  worried about burn-in brought it back, but the, the screen was like cast off LG screens, I guess,
[01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:47.600]  I don't know. But the reds look Brown, everything looked muddy. Like you were looking at it through
[01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:53.200]  a sheet of parchment paper. And it was just, it was, it was a terrible screen. And so I think
[01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:58.480]  when they got, you know, better suppliers here for these two screens I think ironically, the,
[01:59:59.120 --> 02:00:02.800]  the smaller one is LG and the bigger one is Samsung. I forget which is which now anyway.
[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:10.240]  I think they, when they, when they tuned the adaptive colors, they turned it up relative to
[02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:15.040]  what they had on the pixel two to like show that there was a clear difference in the screen because
[02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:18.800]  their defense of the original pixel two screen was, Hey, no, these are actually color accurate.
[02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:23.760]  We scientifically tested the colors, but it just looks terrible. And so,
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:29.200]  well, and it's funny because displays are, displays are a funny thing to review because
[02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:36.000]  you can't show, you can't really show a display because you're whoever's watching your video or
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:41.920]  looking at the photos on your review is looking at those on it's on a display, right? You can't
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:46.880]  really show a display on a display. You know what I mean? You can, and you can put one side by side
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:50.960]  and see some of the, Oh, I see, I see which way it's going, but until you see it in your hand,
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:55.040]  you're like, you can't do it. And I remember last year thinking, I don't know if I should
[02:00:55.040 --> 02:00:59.200]  buy the pixel too. You know, I already have the pixel one. I didn't really use it a lot.
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:03.200]  Maybe I should just get one every other year. And I went into a Verizon store and I remember reading
[02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:08.320]  the reviews and I picked one up and I was like, it's like the grandpa Simpson thing where he,
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:13.680]  he goes into the bordello, he like walks into the bordello and Bart is working the door and
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:17.840]  he takes off his hat and then he just turned the seasons. Bart just turns around and walks right
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:23.680]  out. I just picked up the pixel too. And I thought, Oh, I see. And I just put it down
[02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:28.240]  and I was just like, I'll wait till next year. Like that was a bad display, whatever the calibration
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:34.960]  was. I, I just can't believe that this, it defaults to this adaptive thing and that it's not
[02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:42.720]  a first run setup thing. And I totally get that. Like maybe Apple airs on the side of too many
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:48.000]  steps in the first run, you know, and I know that it's, it's a tricky balance because you
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:53.440]  don't want to make it feel like you're taking the SAT before you get to use your new device.
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:59.680]  You know, nobody likes setting up, but you have to ask some questions. And if you're even thinking
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:05.920]  about making the default, so such a polarizing decision. Yeah. I can't believe that they don't
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:10.960]  even bring it up as an option. I really, I really can't believe it. I thought, and, and Matthew
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:17.040]  Panzerino of tech crunch, he got a review unit of the pixel three around the same time. And so we
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:22.240]  both had them when we were in New York recently for the, I think it was when we picked up, like
[02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:29.760]  I said, like when we picked up the 10 hours and we're both very at the time, we're very, very new
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:33.520]  to the pixel three. No, it wasn't for the 10 hour thing. It was for the iPad event because I remember
[02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:39.360]  I saw you, I was when we saw you guys in the green room then. Yeah. Yeah. So Panzerino and I are both
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:43.040]  new to the pixel three and we're taking pictures and we're both like, what the hell are all these
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:46.880]  people saying that this is a great camera. This is the worst camera I've ever seen that doesn't get
[02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:52.480]  any of the colors. Right. And I've, and we're both, we were like, this is garbage. And then
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:57.760]  I thought to myself, wait, maybe it's the display. And I like sent one to myself and I looked at it
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:03.200]  on my iPhone and I was like, Oh, this is a terrific camera. This, the colors are completely
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:08.320]  right. Yeah. And we were like, Oh my God. And then we started digging around and you know,
[02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:12.720]  it's not like the setting is hidden. It is in settings, display, advanced colors. I mean,
[02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:17.040]  it's, you know, once you, the advanced thing I think is a little unnecessary. And again,
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:22.240]  the terms aren't good, but then once you switch it to natural, it's better. Yeah. But the colors
[02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:27.360]  still aren't right. And I've shown this to a couple people, like a lot of indoor areas,
[02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:33.040]  I'll hold up an iPhone, hold up the pixel three indoors. And I'm, you know, so I'm looking at the
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:38.640]  same scene on an iPhone through the camera, on the pixel three through the camera and with my eyes,
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:44.160]  looking at the actual scene and the colors on the iPhone look exactly like what I see with my eyes
[02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:48.880]  and the colors on the pixel three don't, but then I take the picture, send it to my iPhone or look
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:56.480]  at it on a Mac and they look, they look, the colors are perfect. Yep. There's nothing else
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:01.760]  to say Samsung and Apple are the only companies that make really good displays. So part of my
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:07.520]  gripe about the argument that the pixel three is the best camera phone in the world is I don't
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:11.280]  know how it can be the best camera phone in the world when it doesn't have a good viewfinder
[02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:16.800]  because the colors aren't right. Like you kind of have to trust what you see. You have to just
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:19.840]  trust that it's going to get the camera right, because it's not going to look right when you
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:28.480]  look at the screen. Right. Yeah. I mean, that's fair. But I mean, I guess for me, it's you know,
[02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:32.080]  the reason for me to take a photo is to send it to somebody and nobody owns a pixel three,
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:37.840]  so they're going to have a better display. It is, it was, it was shocking. And it is,
[02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:43.920]  it shows how spoiled I am and maybe how insular I am to the Apple world where I'm just so used to
[02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:50.640]  perfectly calibrated displays that I never have to worry about that it didn't occur to me for days
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:55.280]  that it was the display and not the camera. I really thought that the guys like you, the rest
[02:04:55.280 --> 02:04:59.440]  of the guys at the verge, like Vlad, I thought you guys were like pulling the biggest punk in
[02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:03.760]  the history of the world. I'm like, I wasted it. I spent like 700 bucks on this phone because
[02:05:03.760 --> 02:05:10.400]  the bird said it was, it was a great camera. This is garbage. Everything's red. Everything looks
[02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:16.240]  like you're in, you know, you know, like, again, like a bordello everything, everything's all like
[02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:22.400]  red. I switched mine. What mode am I on right now? I think I'm on natural, but I may have gone
[02:05:22.400 --> 02:05:26.880]  to boosted just for that boosted for a couple of days because I don't like natural either.
[02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:30.880]  Adaptive though makes me want to throw the phone in the garbage. I cannot believe that they don't
[02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:39.280]  even ask about it. Very strange. But the camera is good. I do see why people who are fans of the
[02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:49.040]  pixel three don't really talk about video. Yeah. It's not video is not bad, but it's not good.
[02:05:49.040 --> 02:05:55.120]  It's not great. And it's, it's, it's, it's definitely a place where, you know, you can do
[02:05:55.120 --> 02:06:02.240]  a lot with software, but the hardware, if your hardware, what am I trying to say? Video will
[02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:09.280]  betray your hardware every time. And Apple has an incredibly powerful chip and incredibly powerful
[02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:15.520]  image sensor and image processor. And that means that you're able to do good video. You can't,
[02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:19.760]  you can't do machine learning on video files or they're too big and it would take too long.
[02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:24.880]  Yeah. And one of the ways that it's not a machine learning thing, I think it's an image signal
[02:06:24.880 --> 02:06:31.920]  processing performance thing is, um, video is always a crop of the sensor. Like you don't get
[02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:36.880]  the full, you know, when you switch, if you ever know, you know, just in case, if you're not a big
[02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:42.320]  fan, just open up your iPhone or whatever phone you have, look at the still photos at one X
[02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:48.480]  magnification switch to video. And it zooms in a little is what it looks like because it's a crop.
[02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:55.840]  The pixel crops a lot more. So yes, it is. It's a, it is the widest you can get in video on the
[02:06:55.840 --> 02:07:01.680]  pixel is not very wide. It's very unnatural to me as somebody who's so used to the iPhone for video.
[02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:09.120]  Yeah. And I mean, I don't know how Google is going to solve this problem because at the end of the
[02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:13.840]  day, they don't have an a series processor. They're waiting on Qualcomm and for as much
[02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:19.360]  shit as we give Intel for not, not knowing what it's doing. Qualcomm is not that much better. What
[02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:25.120]  you get outside of like it's bread and butter use cases of modems and sort of standard processing
[02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:29.920]  for, you know, Android phones, right? When you get into like smartwatch battery or smartwatch
[02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:35.120]  processors, or like other sorts of things that the computation you need to do to shoot good video,
[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:38.880]  they're just, they just don't have it. And I don't know how Google gets around that sort of making
[02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:43.120]  its own silicon. It's doing that a little bit. They have their own image processing chip, but
[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:45.120]  I think they're going to have to do a lot more if they want to catch up.
[02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:51.680]  For stills it is absolutely it is. I think it's just a terrific camera. Maybe I don't,
[02:07:51.680 --> 02:07:56.480]  I don't know if it's for certain better than the iPhone. I think it's close,
[02:07:56.480 --> 02:08:01.440]  but it's certainly in the ballpark. And in certain ways it's, you know, it's, it's better.
[02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:08.240]  The night side thing is amazing. It really is. Yeah. So I prefer the pixel photos just because
[02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:14.320]  they, they tend to be there. This is again, it's all, it all comes out to aesthetics at this point
[02:08:14.320 --> 02:08:17.840]  or mostly. I do think that they tend to look a little bit more dramatic. They're a little
[02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:24.240]  bit more contrasty. But what's interesting is the pixel three actually became a little
[02:08:24.240 --> 02:08:29.600]  bit less blue, a little more yellow, a little bit less dramatic and a tiny little bit less
[02:08:29.600 --> 02:08:35.280]  contrasty compared to the pixel two. So Google actually moved the aesthetics of its images and
[02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:40.160]  its image processing a little bit closer to what the iPhone does, which is really fascinating.
[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:45.680]  Yeah. I saw it, you know, and I told you we did the the family Christmas tree thing today and I
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:49.280]  took, I had both phones with me and I have some photos and I was looking at them just before we
[02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:54.080]  started recording and there was a couple I took of my son and you know, he's surrounded by green
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:09:00.720]  Christmas trees. And I had to say that I liked the pixel one better because it was more contrasty
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:06.720]  and the green was very like a rich, vibrant green of these trees. Whereas the phone, the iPhone
[02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:12.480]  seemed, I wouldn't say washed out, but it looked what the greens look washed out on compared to
[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:18.560]  the pixel side by side. It was like, they're both so good, but it's clear that their engineering
[02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:23.840]  teams have made different priority, you know, had different priorities and are slightly different
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:29.120]  decisions in that, you know, the pipeline between a mid sensor and saving the actual JPEG.
[02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:34.400]  Yeah. And you could see that and then certain, so sometimes one looks better than the other.
[02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:41.360]  It is for sure. I think Apple, I think Apple cares more about getting the people right and
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:47.120]  the skin tone, especially on people. Right. And I think Google's looking at the whole scene a
[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:51.840]  little bit more and that's going to lead to like, one's going to win some situations. One's going
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:58.320]  to win in other situations and cases. It hasn't kicked in for me much in real life. I don't know
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:02.640]  why, but, and I've taken a ton of photos with that. I forget how many I took, at least 600,
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:12.480]  maybe more. But when it asks you if you'd like to take a different frame because the subject was
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:18.560]  looking away, it is so, it's so brilliant. And it, and the other thing is in over a month with
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:23.040]  hundreds of pictures taken, it has never once asked me that. It almost never does. It only
[02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:29.360]  comes up a couple of times. It has never asked me that when it wasn't an improvement. Really?
[02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:32.800]  Yeah. Oh, that's yeah. I've had a couple that were a little bit, little bit off, but again,
[02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:36.240]  that's like, I don't know how many like thousand photos I've taken. The worst I can say was there
[02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:42.320]  was one where they were, it was hard to say it was 50, 50 and it was sort of like, they were
[02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:47.760]  right that neither was great. Yeah. There was it's, and it's sort of spooky that, that the
[02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:53.920]  machine learning is so good at identifying a, the subject of this is clearly a human being,
[02:10:53.920 --> 02:11:00.080]  and this human being doesn't really look good. Yeah. What's impressive about the experience
[02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:04.560]  of using the camera and the Pixel 3 is what they did. They fixed their algorithms. They
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:08.080]  improved their portrait mode a little bit. It's not quite as good as the iPhone with the two
[02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:14.800]  lenses, but it's pretty good. And then they just ladled on a bunch of features and having reviewed
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:20.480]  phones for 12 years or whatever it is now. Anytime a company says, here's our camera,
[02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:24.560]  and here's the 15 new things we added to it. You know, you're in for a disaster because they're
[02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:28.080]  all going to feel like they're tacked on and they're going to feel like gimmicks and they're
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:35.440]  not going to work very well. And somehow they managed to avoid that for the most part on this
[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:42.000]  camera, the stuff that they do feels pretty well integrated. And when you use it, it's, you know,
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:48.000]  it seems like it's worth using. It's a very well done app. It's not just that the features are
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:52.960]  there and the machine learning and the AI and what, you know, the, this ignorant image chip
[02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:57.600]  that they have, whatever. It's not just the engineering. It's, to me, it's by far and away
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:04.080]  my favorite app on the device. It's a really nice app. And, you know, in some ways, you know,
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:08.480]  there's, there's a, it's not that different from using the iPhone camera app. I mean, you know,
[02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:13.200]  like, I don't know, they put like the button to switch from the front to the back on the left
[02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:19.920]  instead of the right. And well, you know, that's just a choice, but I don't know. It just, it, it
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:23.040]  doesn't get in your way. And like you said, it sounds like, ah, there's a bunch of features.
[02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:29.760]  How much, how annoying are they going to be? And they're not annoying. There's an interesting
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:34.160]  philosophical difference between Google and Apple that I, I thought about as I've used this because
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:40.080]  I've, um, I didn't get, I didn't, I'm not enough of an Android nerd. I didn't want to
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:45.040]  screw the phone up. So I didn't get the night sight thing when it was, uh,
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:49.200]  like unofficial. Yeah, I didn't do that. I just waited to get the over the air thing.
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:54.960]  Um, and I got it and I, you know, it's obviously, you know, because it's the only phone in the world
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:13:00.800]  that has this feature, it's, it's, you know, super exciting. Um, and it, you know, at times is,
[02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:06.320]  well, it's often amazing. And at times it gives you a picture that you just simply couldn't get
[02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:12.880]  otherwise. Um, that's a picture worth keeping. Um, there are other times where it takes pictures
[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:17.600]  and I, you know, even in the example pictures that people have posted, um, where it's like,
[02:13:17.600 --> 02:13:23.760]  that's technically amazing, but it, I don't like it because it looks like daytime. It's so it gets
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:27.840]  such a good exposure that it doesn't look, it doesn't look true to the scene. Like, you know,
[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:32.320]  this is supposed to look like a dark street at night and it looks like daytime. Yep. Um,
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:36.720]  well, that's why I'm really glad they made it a separate mode. If they had tried to build that
[02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:40.960]  into like something that happens automatically in the main camera, I would have flipped a lid
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:46.480]  because I want, I w I want consistency and like, I want to get, know what I'm going to get when I
[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:50.480]  click the camera shutter. But with night sight, you kind of don't know. It's always something you
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:54.880]  use like, well, this is a crazy situation to try and take a photo. Let me give this a shot
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:58.960]  instead of just replace the main camera function. Yeah. And they have a nice UI for it too,
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:03.120]  because you're just, you open the camera app, you're just framing a photo and if it's low
[02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:08.480]  light, it says try night sight and there's, you know, if you don't want to, you can just
[02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:12.960]  take your picture as usual, take your chances, holding your hand still. And then if you want
[02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:18.880]  to go night's night, it's, you know, just tap that button that pops up only when the phone
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:25.040]  only when the phone thinks it might be useful. Yep. And so you're not surprised, you know, you're
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:30.160]  in night sight. And therefore, you know, you have to take three or four seconds, I think, you know,
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:36.400]  maybe two, three seconds, whatever it is to hold the camera while it's Yeah, while it's making the
[02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:41.440]  exposure. And it's interesting. So the thought that I had at first was, well, this is interesting.
[02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:47.040]  And it's obviously useful. And so, you know, it'll probably spread to other phones, including the
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:52.720]  iPhone in some way, whether it's next year or two years, whenever. But now, now that I'm using it,
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:56.320]  and thinking about the way the iPhone works, and looking at the difference between the portrait
[02:14:56.320 --> 02:15:01.360]  modes on the two phones, it occurs to me that maybe not, maybe the iPhone wouldn't ever do this,
[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:07.840]  because there's clearly a philosophical difference between Apple and Google's camera teams, which is
[02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:13.040]  that Apple, philosophically only seemingly, I mean, maybe they can always change their
[02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:18.160]  mind in the future. But so far, they only do things that they can do live in the viewfinder.
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:25.440]  Right. And Google will do things that happen afterwards. So in Google's portrait mode,
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:30.080]  portrait mode is the perfect example. When you're doing portrait mode, on the iPhone,
[02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:35.920]  you see the portrait phone live in the viewfinder in real time, as you move the camera around. And
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:40.720]  then the image you take is exactly what you saw, when you hit the shutter button, right is on the
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:45.600]  Google phone, when you're in portrait mode, it doesn't look any different than the regular mode.
[02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:50.240]  And then you take the picture. And it applies the portrait mode in the next
[02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:55.360]  maybe second or two. Yeah, you can even see it sometimes, especially like in night mode,
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:58.960]  if you like, you hop into the picture right away, you like see the garbage and all of a sudden it
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:03.520]  resolves. Right? It's exactly right. Night Sight's perfect like that. Because you take it and of
[02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:08.000]  course, I'm super excited to be taking Night Sight pictures. So I'm like, Oh, here's a good time.
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:12.560]  Oh, I'll take it and it's like up. This isn't that great. And then it's like, Oh, no, wait.
[02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:18.240]  Oh, that's interesting. You know, but it takes that much time. Yeah. And Night Sight now. So
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:24.400]  portrait mode obviously can happen in real time. Because it Apple does it in real time. Right. But
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:30.400]  Night Sight by definition can't happen in real time. You can't, you can't in real time preview,
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:35.680]  what three seconds worth of exposures algorithmically stitched together into a
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:40.560]  cohesive sharp still image will look like by definition, because you need the three seconds.
[02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:47.040]  And so I wonder if Apple will do it. I mean, maybe they if it becomes popular enough,
[02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:52.240]  and other phones pick it up, they might have to quote unquote. Yeah, I hadn't thought of the idea
[02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:56.800]  that Apple philosophically doesn't want to do anything that you can't preview live in the in
[02:16:56.800 --> 02:17:01.120]  the viewfinder. And I'm, I'm trying to think if like, I mean, I guess you could argue that like
[02:17:01.120 --> 02:17:06.160]  panorama doesn't but even that it's like, I don't know if you think that's really like a philosophical
[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:11.760]  thing that they want to believe in. No, I mean, I've talked to people who are familiar with the
[02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:22.400]  situation and it is okay. It's why the 10 are that you know, the 10 R has portrait mode and 10 R does
[02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:26.480]  everything in real time to even with a single camera, but the 10 are in portrait mode doesn't
[02:17:26.480 --> 02:17:32.320]  have the stage lighting effects, which I don't really find useful. I've never once I don't I
[02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:36.800]  almost never even apply them, frankly. Yeah. So even when I have tried to apply them, they don't
[02:17:36.800 --> 02:17:41.680]  look like the ones Apple has that look good. They look like somebody's head got cut off or something.
[02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:47.040]  Yeah. Yep. But the 10 R doesn't even have them because it can't do them in real time. Huh? With
[02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:52.400]  the with the one you know, obviously, it has the same chips. So it's not the chips. It's the fact
[02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:58.000]  that it doesn't have two cameras. Right. So it is that's Yeah, that makes sense. And every feature
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:05.920]  that they have the in like the latest and greatest that doesn't work on older iPhones. It's not
[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:10.240]  marketing spite, like, Oh, we're gonna we want you to pay to get the new phone to get it. It's
[02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:14.960]  because they can't do it in real time without blank. Right. So some of the new stuff can't be
[02:18:14.960 --> 02:18:21.600]  done in real time, just because the new the neural engine thing on the A 12 is so much faster than it
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:26.960]  was before. Right. Like every single one of those things that that seems like it could be marketing
[02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:34.320]  spite, as I call it, is literally, I mean, you can say that the that the refusal to not do anything
[02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:40.640]  that can't be shown in real time is marketing spite, but that's their attitude. Right. I mean,
[02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:44.320]  that makes sense. Again, like the most important thing with the camera is predictability, right?
[02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:46.880]  Right. You're going to take a picture and it's going to do what you think it's going to do.
[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:51.360]  Well, but on the other hand, like I'm I started my life in as an amateur photographer shooting
[02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:58.320]  on film and film, film was entirely, you know, find out what you got later. Right. So I think
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:02.560]  I don't even it to me, it's a six of one half a dozen of the other it's two different approaches.
[02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:07.280]  I don't say one is better than the other. I mean, there's advantages to both. But I'm not like put
[02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:13.360]  off by Google's render it later approach, because maybe it's just the old film shooter in me where
[02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:18.720]  looking through the viewfinder of a 35 millimeter camera, there was no Boca, you know,
[02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:23.440]  right. Everything was in focus. I could focus at any distance I wanted to.
[02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:32.320]  You know, it's it and and you'd find out, you know, what kind of depth of field you really had
[02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:36.160]  when you got your film developed. So right, you know, having to wait two seconds as opposed to
[02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:43.200]  waiting three days. Yeah, whatever. Yeah. It still feels like magic to me, but it couldn't happen in
[02:19:43.200 --> 02:19:53.840]  Night Sight otherwise. Yeah. I do wonder what other photographic problems Google thinks machine
[02:19:53.840 --> 02:19:58.160]  learning can tackle. So I know that the next one for them is going to be white balance. They
[02:19:58.160 --> 02:20:03.120]  actually they have a different white balance algorithm in the standard camera than they do
[02:20:03.120 --> 02:20:08.000]  in Night Sight. So when they went so the way Night Sight works, it's if you haven't seen it,
[02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:15.440]  that it takes up to 15 frames. They're not long exposures, but they can be longer. And then it
[02:20:15.440 --> 02:20:20.240]  stitches them together. And then it also if you have handshake, it's able to use machine
[02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:23.840]  learning to make sure everything lines up and stay sharp. And so what you get is you get a
[02:20:23.840 --> 02:20:28.000]  picture that often has less noise than you otherwise have because it's able to average
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:32.560]  over the different shots you took. And it also makes it look unreal because it's brighter than
[02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:37.840]  it otherwise would be. Anyway, when you do that and you make a photo that is, you know, you took
[02:20:37.840 --> 02:20:42.960]  it in the dark, but it looks like it's daytime. It turns out that white balance goes bonkers. It
[02:20:42.960 --> 02:20:47.600]  goes crazy. Everything looks yellow or strange. And so they just they did a standard machine
[02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:52.000]  learning thing, which is they're like, well, these all look wrong. So they had everybody fix them to
[02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:56.240]  make the white balance right. And they did that with, you know, some sample of photos. And then
[02:20:56.240 --> 02:21:02.000]  they just told the camera, all right, make the white balance look like that. So they didn't,
[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.560]  you know, they didn't manually tune anything. They're just like, these all look right. Those
[02:21:04.560 --> 02:21:08.400]  will look wrong. Make it look more like that. And that's the white balance that gets applied
[02:21:08.400 --> 02:21:13.680]  to Night Sight. And I'm sure they're going to try and bring that to the main camera.
[02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:19.200]  But I got to think there's other stuff that they think can be, you know, machine learned
[02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:25.520]  or whatever. And so then at some point, will that philosophical difference of, you know,
[02:21:25.520 --> 02:21:31.520]  what is a quote unquote true it picture of a thing going to be and what counts and what doesn't
[02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:37.520]  might be a bigger rift between Apple and Google if Apple falls on the, you know,
[02:21:37.520 --> 02:21:41.520]  putting that line at a different spot. Yeah, it could end of the day, there's no such thing as
[02:21:41.520 --> 02:21:49.760]  like a true image. Right. And I think Apple's, you know, excitement over the fake bokeh in portrait
[02:21:49.760 --> 02:21:55.440]  mode shows that they're not adamant about that either. Because it's right, you know, you know,
[02:21:55.440 --> 02:22:03.040]  there are foot, you know, purists, if you will, who are offended by the idea of fake bokeh.
[02:22:05.360 --> 02:22:10.880]  And, you know, I'm, you know, I was always a fan. I liked the early years of Instagram when
[02:22:10.880 --> 02:22:17.040]  everybody was using the filters. Yeah, me too. I thought that was great. And, you know, I think
[02:22:17.040 --> 02:22:22.480]  it was this thing of the times, you know, and it wasn't going to last forever. But it was a fun,
[02:22:22.480 --> 02:22:29.760]  it was a very effective way, in my opinion, to patch over the fact that the camera phones of
[02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:36.800]  the time were still kind of camera phony and not real. Camera camera, you know, that they were
[02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:40.240]  still kind of, you know, we're getting to the point where a camera phone was actually just a
[02:22:40.240 --> 02:22:45.440]  good camera in any way period. Applying those filters that made them look like snapshots from
[02:22:45.440 --> 02:22:53.200]  1977 was a fun way to patch over that. Yeah. So I'm cool with that. And I'm cool with portrait
[02:22:53.200 --> 02:22:58.400]  mode. And sometimes I get portrait mode shots. I like them. And, and they especially look good
[02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:04.480]  on the phone itself when they're small, like, and then there's a lot of times I'll take a portrait
[02:23:04.480 --> 02:23:10.480]  mode photo, and then I look at it on my iMac. And I'm like, oh, that's actually, that's actually
[02:23:10.480 --> 02:23:15.920]  not good at all. That doesn't, that is, ooh. And it's like, it looks totally fake and gross.
[02:23:16.480 --> 02:23:20.400]  But most people look at their pictures on their phone, you know? Yeah. And they'll
[02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:23.920]  scroll by it on Instagram and they'll look at it for long enough to double tap it to give
[02:23:23.920 --> 02:23:28.320]  you a like, and they move on to the next thing. No one's actually, you know, zooming in to see
[02:23:28.320 --> 02:23:31.840]  if the hair got cropped perfectly correctly or not. Right. Right. So, I mean, you know,
[02:23:31.840 --> 02:23:35.680]  ideally you want it to look good as big as it can get. And, you know, and Apple famously for
[02:23:35.680 --> 02:23:39.920]  the last three or four years now has spent a gazillion dollars on the shot with iPhone
[02:23:39.920 --> 02:23:45.120]  marketing campaign, putting iPhone photographs on the biggest billboards, you know, they can buy.
[02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:49.920]  So, you know, Apple's certainly on board with making printing iPhone photos very large,
[02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:56.800]  but I think it's okay to add features that work best when looked on the iPhone itself.
[02:23:56.800 --> 02:24:01.280]  And portrait mode is one of those things. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. I wonder what else AI can do.
[02:24:01.280 --> 02:24:09.040]  I feel like I'm not, I'm not imaginative enough. Like, I feel like they're going to continue to
[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:15.840]  surprise us. Yeah. Well, it is literally just imagination, right? The method for this white
[02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:21.360]  balance thing is just take a data set, fix it and say, do that thing. And, you know, in my head,
[02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:24.880]  when I think about, you know, machine learning and camera stuff, I always think in terms of,
[02:24:24.880 --> 02:24:30.960]  I don't know, like a Moore's law, like more processing power, more, you know, better sensors,
[02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:34.800]  faster chips, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But this was just them saying, oh, wait,
[02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:40.000]  we have this methodology that, you know, works for recognizing, you know, dogs on the internet.
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:44.640]  Well, that same idea could work to fix white balance. So it's, it's literally, can you,
[02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:48.720]  can you take that same method and apply it to some other thing? You know, if you can build a data set,
[02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:52.560]  you can tell the computer to try and match it. Yeah. And I think the other thing that,
[02:24:52.560 --> 02:25:01.360]  you know, that's exciting is that like the actual Moore's law, Moore's law with CPU's has been over
[02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:05.840]  for a while. Like our CPU's just aren't getting faster. And so the things that could be improved
[02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:12.000]  by radically faster CPU's we're not getting, but like the machine learning stuff is in a,
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:19.280]  like early years of the eighties CPU phase where, you know, the, the a 12 really is
[02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:24.880]  like ridiculously faster than the a 11 at the neural engine stuff. And, you know,
[02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:29.840]  Google's got their chip and the pixel three one is way faster, you know, like the one year,
[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:35.360]  just wait a year. This stuff gets so much faster. And when you have those cycles and you can throw
[02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:43.200]  that many iterations of the machine learning thing at an image, you can really, really do amazing
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:48.720]  things. Like I feel like the portrait mode stuff is going to get so good, so fast that this anybody
[02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:55.440]  who's skeptical about it still is, is eventually is going to have to give in. Yeah. Oh, for sure.
[02:25:55.440 --> 02:26:00.400]  I mean, I have to imagine every time a phone ships and people that are working on this stuff, see what
[02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:05.200]  we all say about the portrait mode are just gritting their teeth because they know they've
[02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:11.280]  got something 10 times better sitting in the lab. You know, I, I think so too. And I, but I also
[02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:15.920]  wonder then too, about like the people who are working on those things, like how do they stand
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:21.760]  leaving at the end of the day and then using the, you know, the pixel three or the iPhone 10 S and,
[02:26:21.760 --> 02:26:27.760]  and they're stuck with this crummy camera when they, when they know that they've got, they've
[02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:33.760]  got one in the lab that is just so much better. Yeah. Anything else? What else did you,
[02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:38.800]  did anything else you want to talk about? Man, I don't know. I'm just sort of glad hardware
[02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:44.800]  season's over. I wish that my last review hadn't been on the pixel slate and all the Palm phone,
[02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:51.040]  but that's, that's the way it goes, I guess. Peter's out. It's it's been an unusually busy
[02:26:51.040 --> 02:26:57.760]  review season for me personally, because I, I did the phone, I did the iPad and the Mac, Mac,
[02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:05.920]  Mac book air. I did not do the Mac mini because I it's like, I'm glad Apple is doing the Mac mini,
[02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:11.600]  but it's like probably the least likely Mac that I would buy. Yeah. It's a, it's such a,
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:15.600]  it's so interesting because a lot of people still, still think of it as like that entry
[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:21.200]  level consumer Mac and it's super not that thing anymore. It's absolutely not. And that's why,
[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:24.480]  you know, it's funny that they're still calling it the Mac mini and we can, you know,
[02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:27.840]  there's the whole thing about why they still calling the Mac book air, the air when it's
[02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:32.640]  thicker and heavier than the regular Mac book. It's like those, it's just names that have stuck,
[02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:37.440]  you know, like the air is the one that looks like that. And there's 13 inches and the Mac
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:42.320]  mini is the one that's a square that's this big, even though it's actually not that many compared
[02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:49.280]  to a lot of these NUC computers and it's downright gigantic compared to the little computers you can
[02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:55.200]  just put on a thumb drive. But it's actually a nice size for what they're doing now, which
[02:27:55.200 --> 02:28:00.160]  is putting like pro components into it. Yep. Oh, anyway, it was good to have you on the show.
[02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:04.560]  I really enjoyed the blast and, you know, a true to form. It was, it was only like an hour or so.
[02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:10.400]  I want to find more to talk about so I don't have to go back to
[02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:16.240]  putting lights on the Christmas tree, but I feel like I've taken up enough of your time.
[02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:24.240]  So my thanks to you. Everybody can follow you. You are back on B-A-C-K-L-O-N on Twitter and,
[02:28:25.280 --> 02:28:32.320]  and can read your fine work at The Verge. Some day next time you're on what we should talk about
[02:28:32.320 --> 02:28:39.760]  is the old, the real Palm. Oh yeah. Happy to do that for days. Because you that's, you know,
[02:28:39.760 --> 02:28:46.000]  if people don't know this, if people don't remember you were, were you the editor in chief?
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:51.840]  What was your title? Yeah. So it was the editor in chief that I also founded it. And at the time
[02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:57.760]  it was called pre-Central. Now it's called, well, now it's gone, but it was WebOS Nation for a minute.
[02:28:58.560 --> 02:29:02.240]  But yeah, so we had this model where it was called, now it's called WebOS Nations,
[02:29:02.240 --> 02:29:08.400]  but it was smartphone experts. So I founded Windows Central and iMore. Although at the time
[02:29:08.400 --> 02:29:14.240]  it was called Phone Different because we didn't know what we were doing. Android Central, a few
[02:29:14.240 --> 02:29:22.400]  others. Anyway, it all grew out of the original website, which was called Visor Central. And so
[02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:27.920]  I've been very involved in the Palm community for a long time. Met my wife because of Palm,
[02:29:27.920 --> 02:29:34.800]  a whole long thing. It's, you know, it would be great for a huge topic on the show, but there's,
[02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:40.400]  it is very funny because I was always a fan. I never had one, but I was a huge fan of the UI.
[02:29:41.840 --> 02:29:46.800]  It was the thing to love about the phone was that it had this great, the whole system.
[02:29:46.800 --> 02:29:54.320]  And I mean that in the truest sense of the word was cohesive and thoughtful. And 11 years later,
[02:29:54.320 --> 02:30:01.360]  all the other phones have finally got up to the UI. Yep. Everybody took a minute. That's the one
[02:30:01.360 --> 02:30:06.560]  thing, you know, like everybody has come to this user interface that is kind of basically the
[02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:14.720]  Palm card interface where you swipe up from the bottom and you go side to side to switch between
[02:30:14.720 --> 02:30:23.840]  apps. Yep. And just this year, Apple and Google got around to implementing the idea that you
[02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:29.600]  should be able to use the thing that you search to also do actions. Right. So with Siri shortcuts
[02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:36.000]  and whatever they're called on Google, I guess it was called actions. I'm still waiting for somebody
[02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:42.480]  to put the notifications at the bottom, which I thought was, I thought that was so perfect.
[02:30:44.320 --> 02:30:47.680]  I think it's perfect until you have a software keyboard and then it's probably a disaster.
[02:30:47.680 --> 02:30:52.800]  That's probably, that is probably why that nobody's done that. I guess, I don't know,
[02:30:52.800 --> 02:30:57.680]  but aesthetically it was, it was superior and it felt like faster. Yeah, for sure.
[02:30:57.680 --> 02:31:03.840]  I, you know what, I will say this as a final note, it, it is easier to switch between iPhone
[02:31:03.840 --> 02:31:08.560]  and Android or at least the pixel version of Android than it ever has been in the past,
[02:31:08.560 --> 02:31:13.920]  just because so many of the interactions are similar now. And I don't, I don't think it's
[02:31:13.920 --> 02:31:20.800]  a case of copying. I think it is sort of water seeking its own level and the best ideas,
[02:31:21.520 --> 02:31:26.240]  you know, everybody kind of arrives at these good ideas, you know, I mean, without question,
[02:31:26.240 --> 02:31:30.880]  we talked about notifications that iOS was clearly behind, at least on the features of
[02:31:30.880 --> 02:31:36.480]  the notification display system for a long time. And it's, you know, gotten a lot more like Android
[02:31:36.480 --> 02:31:41.360]  where they're grouped together by app and you can deal with them as a group if you want or expand
[02:31:41.360 --> 02:31:47.200]  them, et cetera, et cetera. The card-based UI switching and stuff like that. It's, it's
[02:31:47.200 --> 02:31:52.400]  definitely easier than it has been in the past. Yeah. That's very generous of you. I do think that
[02:31:52.400 --> 02:31:59.520]  the multitasking system and the core card switching system on the pixel feel like they're
[02:31:59.520 --> 02:32:04.320]  a little bit more of a rip at the iPhone and it's certainly way less elegant. It's way more fun to
[02:32:04.320 --> 02:32:07.680]  switch between stuff on an iPhone than it is on a pixel. I was trying to be generous.
[02:32:11.520 --> 02:32:15.600]  The one thing that drives me nuts is that you still have to tap the home button. You can't,
[02:32:15.600 --> 02:32:24.000]  it's like they didn't copy enough. The companies that are more willing to just blatantly steal
[02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:28.000]  from Apple, like OnePlus has a different multitasking, like UI system for the buttons
[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:32.240]  at the bottom. It's just better. It's just like swiping up is way more natural. Yeah.
[02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:40.320]  Anyway, back on Twitter, the verge words is where your fine work can be read and viewed.
[02:32:41.200 --> 02:32:44.720]  And I thank you for your time. Have a good holiday season. You too, man. Have fun with
[02:32:44.720 --> 02:32:47.600]  those Christmas lights. This has been a blast. God help me.
