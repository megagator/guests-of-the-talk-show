[00:00.000 --> 00:02.280]  I don't think I've ever told you this.
[00:02.280 --> 00:04.300]  I am a big believer in the poodle.
[00:04.300 --> 00:08.620]  I also believe though that we should keep it quiet.
[00:08.620 --> 00:11.300]  But I feel like I'm almost out of this.
[00:11.300 --> 00:13.420]  Jonas is heading into 11th grade.
[00:13.420 --> 00:17.800]  I think we're hopefully getting out of the quarantine.
[00:17.800 --> 00:21.600]  I feel like if I've gotten this far and we haven't gotten a dog,
[00:21.600 --> 00:23.440]  I'm going to get out of this without a dog.
[00:23.440 --> 00:24.920]  But in my back pocket,
[00:24.920 --> 00:26.000]  I've had all along,
[00:26.000 --> 00:28.280]  if we got to get a dog, we're getting a poodle.
[00:28.280 --> 00:30.720]  Yeah. Because they're great.
[00:30.720 --> 00:34.920]  He's good. He's 11,
[00:34.920 --> 00:36.760]  but old dogs age faster,
[00:36.760 --> 00:40.160]  so he's a little rickety at this point.
[00:40.160 --> 00:42.200]  But he's a good boy.
[00:42.200 --> 00:44.360]  They're great dogs. They're smart.
[00:44.360 --> 00:46.480]  They have a great disposition.
[00:46.480 --> 00:48.760]  They don't shed.
[00:48.760 --> 00:50.280]  They don't shed.
[00:50.280 --> 00:52.600]  They do not shed.
[00:53.600 --> 00:56.360]  The only thing that happens is Karen will cut
[00:56.360 --> 00:59.160]  his hair and then leave the hairline all over the place.
[00:59.160 --> 01:01.880]  I assume under the assumption,
[01:01.880 --> 01:03.880]  the Roomba will take care of her.
[01:03.880 --> 01:06.200]  I'm not sure what's going on there.
[01:06.200 --> 01:10.200]  We also have, Amy had a poodle growing up named Andy.
[01:10.200 --> 01:11.840]  He was a great dog.
[01:11.840 --> 01:13.440]  They live a long time.
[01:13.440 --> 01:15.400]  Andy was unbelievable.
[01:15.400 --> 01:17.120]  I honestly got it.
[01:17.120 --> 01:19.000]  Was that a little one?
[01:19.000 --> 01:21.760]  He was like a mid-size. He wasn't like yours.
[01:21.760 --> 01:23.840]  I think we'll go mid-size next time.
[01:23.840 --> 01:32.800]  Yeah. Andy was a black poodle who wasn't big like yours.
[01:32.800 --> 01:33.760]  What's your dog's name?
[01:33.760 --> 01:34.560]  Grant.
[01:34.560 --> 01:35.400]  Grant.
[01:35.400 --> 01:36.200]  Yeah.
[01:36.200 --> 01:40.400]  Wasn't a big one, but he wasn't one of those mid-toy poodles.
[01:41.760 --> 01:43.520]  Well, that was the thing.
[01:43.520 --> 01:44.840]  If we were going to get a poodle,
[01:44.840 --> 01:46.800]  I want to get a big one because I didn't want
[01:46.800 --> 01:49.560]  something that would shiver every time the door opened.
[01:49.560 --> 01:51.000]  Andy was a good dog.
[01:51.000 --> 01:52.440]  He was a very good dog.
[01:52.440 --> 01:55.520]  But he lived a truly preposterous number of years.
[01:55.520 --> 01:57.840]  I honestly don't think I'm exaggerating in the least.
[01:57.840 --> 02:00.120]  I think he might have been 18 when he died.
[02:00.120 --> 02:01.520]  Wow.
[02:01.520 --> 02:05.120]  But he lost his hearing towards the end.
[02:05.120 --> 02:07.640]  I mean, and eventually lost it all.
[02:07.640 --> 02:08.480]  But he was in good health.
[02:08.480 --> 02:10.840]  I mean, for a dog that lived to be 18,
[02:10.840 --> 02:14.640]  going deaf is probably the least of his problems.
[02:14.640 --> 02:17.320]  And Amy's mom's house had this vent.
[02:17.320 --> 02:18.720]  It still has the vent, I guess.
[02:18.720 --> 02:19.920]  I shouldn't say she still lives there.
[02:19.920 --> 02:22.360]  But it has a vent in the floor and in the winter.
[02:22.360 --> 02:23.680]  It was just his spot.
[02:23.680 --> 02:27.720]  And the hot air would just come out.
[02:27.720 --> 02:31.120]  And many dogs did not care for the mail carrier
[02:31.120 --> 02:34.840]  and apparently would have dreams about the mail carrier.
[02:34.840 --> 02:37.200]  So the real mail would come.
[02:37.200 --> 02:39.160]  And for years and years, you wouldn't even
[02:39.160 --> 02:41.840]  hear the mail drop in through the slot.
[02:41.840 --> 02:44.240]  But then he would seemingly have dreams
[02:44.240 --> 02:47.160]  and just jump out of his corner.
[02:47.160 --> 02:48.040]  Go barking?
[02:48.040 --> 02:48.880]  Yeah.
[02:48.880 --> 02:51.480]  And it's kind of neat because an old dog is still
[02:51.480 --> 02:55.640]  a lot more limber and fast than an old person.
[02:55.640 --> 02:56.520]  You know what I mean?
[02:56.520 --> 02:59.800]  A 17-year-old dog, when he had a dream about the mailman,
[02:59.800 --> 03:02.840]  could still book it.
[03:02.840 --> 03:03.960]  Well, Grant can't do that.
[03:03.960 --> 03:06.840]  Grant, he's only 11, but big dogs
[03:06.840 --> 03:08.240]  have hip problems a lot of times.
[03:08.240 --> 03:09.640]  And he's got hip problems.
[03:09.640 --> 03:11.680]  He's got arthritis and stuff like that already.
[03:11.680 --> 03:16.080]  So he's wearing down fast.
[03:16.080 --> 03:18.240]  Yeah, but he does that sleep dream thing.
[03:18.240 --> 03:23.280]  So you see his paws moving a lot when he's asleep.
[03:23.280 --> 03:25.120]  And then one night, I was home.
[03:25.120 --> 03:26.400]  And I was up late working.
[03:26.400 --> 03:27.960]  And I was sitting in the living room.
[03:27.960 --> 03:29.400]  And he was lying there next to me.
[03:29.400 --> 03:33.000]  And we had a bunch of things go wrong in the house.
[03:33.000 --> 03:35.240]  And I can't remember exactly what.
[03:35.240 --> 03:38.200]  But just like you buy a house, it's a money sink.
[03:38.200 --> 03:41.880]  So I was mad about all that stuff.
[03:41.880 --> 03:44.280]  And all of a sudden, I hear this thump, thump, thump, thump.
[03:44.280 --> 03:45.280]  And I'm like, oh, god.
[03:45.280 --> 03:45.760]  Now what?
[03:45.760 --> 03:47.040]  What is going on in this house?
[03:47.040 --> 03:48.240]  What is broken down in this house?
[03:48.240 --> 03:49.920]  And I'm looking around trying to figure out what this noise is.
[03:49.920 --> 03:53.120]  And he's asleep, and he's having a happy dream in his wagon, his tail.
[03:53.120 --> 03:56.840]  Thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump.
[03:56.840 --> 03:58.680]  We went out to eat last night.
[03:58.680 --> 03:59.200]  Oh, really?
[03:59.200 --> 04:00.760]  Oh, it was great.
[04:00.760 --> 04:02.440]  It was actually great.
[04:02.440 --> 04:03.040]  I say this.
[04:03.040 --> 04:06.640]  This is the first time we've been out to eat since March.
[04:06.640 --> 04:07.160]  I forget.
[04:07.160 --> 04:08.640]  I used to know the date.
[04:08.640 --> 04:14.720]  It was like March 10th, I think, or something like that.
[04:14.720 --> 04:17.840]  But we went out to eat for the first time, and it was great.
[04:17.840 --> 04:21.920]  Philly, the rules are still no indoor dining.
[04:21.920 --> 04:23.440]  There's a rumor, possibly.
[04:23.440 --> 04:25.560]  I guess the plan is some point mid-September,
[04:25.560 --> 04:30.960]  they might reopen indoor dining with 25% capacity and a bunch of rules.
[04:30.960 --> 04:35.360]  But in the meantime, outdoor dining only, which we've had for weeks.
[04:35.360 --> 04:41.600]  And we, the groupers, have simply decided we're just not going to partake in.
[04:41.600 --> 04:46.240]  And it's just a vague, like, eh, we're good.
[04:46.240 --> 04:48.320]  Yeah, that's how I feel currently.
[04:48.320 --> 04:50.360]  I mean, I might do outdoor dining, though.
[04:50.360 --> 04:52.680]  I mean, that would be certainly something that I would consider.
[04:52.680 --> 04:54.840]  I would not consider indoor dining at this point.
[04:54.840 --> 05:00.440]  One of the factors for us isn't germophobia or overt fear of getting it.
[05:00.440 --> 05:06.440]  It's that July and August in Philadelphia are very hot and humid.
[05:06.440 --> 05:08.000]  I mean, really hot and humid.
[05:08.000 --> 05:14.000]  And I don't like to be sweaty when I'm eating.
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.840]  And I take the heat better than other members of the family.
[05:16.840 --> 05:18.560]  So it's just, you know, I get it.
[05:18.560 --> 05:19.560]  And it's great to see it.
[05:19.560 --> 05:22.760]  We go out for walks all the time, and we go past all these restaurants.
[05:22.760 --> 05:25.200]  And there's more and more of them opening up with lots of tables.
[05:25.200 --> 05:27.080]  And it's just a delight to see.
[05:27.080 --> 05:31.160]  And it's good to see that restaurants are not thriving.
[05:31.160 --> 05:34.240]  But it seems like some of them have enough space and enough tables
[05:34.240 --> 05:37.840]  that hopefully they're breaking even, at least.
[05:37.840 --> 05:38.680]  And I'm so glad to see it.
[05:38.680 --> 05:39.960]  But we went out to eat last night.
[05:39.960 --> 05:42.720]  And it was great.
[05:42.720 --> 05:45.040]  It was very nice.
[05:45.040 --> 05:51.640]  But boy, what a weird thing, you know, to go six months without eating
[05:51.640 --> 05:53.920]  at any restaurant at all.
[05:53.920 --> 05:55.800]  We do take out an awful lot.
[05:55.800 --> 05:56.560]  Yeah.
[05:56.560 --> 06:00.920]  Yeah, we've been in a restaurant, other than to pick up food.
[06:00.920 --> 06:01.840]  Right, same here.
[06:01.840 --> 06:03.400]  Same exact thing here.
[06:03.400 --> 06:07.160]  And for us, BC, and it was like last Friday, I picked up pizza.
[06:07.160 --> 06:14.600]  And I was like, what in the world is going on with all the DoorDash
[06:14.600 --> 06:16.880]  people at the pizza place where I've been before?
[06:16.880 --> 06:18.680]  And I realized, because it was raining.
[06:18.680 --> 06:19.760]  And it wasn't like pouring down rain.
[06:19.760 --> 06:20.600]  It was just a rainy night.
[06:20.600 --> 06:23.600]  But because it was a rainy night, nobody could eat outside.
[06:23.600 --> 06:29.480]  And so therefore, anybody whose plans were I don't want to cook
[06:29.480 --> 06:31.680]  was getting takeout.
[06:31.680 --> 06:35.640]  And so the difference between a nice Friday night
[06:35.640 --> 06:38.600]  and a rainy Friday night in terms of how many people
[06:38.600 --> 06:46.440]  are waiting at the pizza place for pickup were just kind of crazy.
[06:46.440 --> 06:47.520]  But they did a great job.
[06:47.520 --> 06:50.120]  And I had to wait a little longer than you'd think.
[06:50.120 --> 06:52.600]  But they were ready for me, paid in advance.
[06:52.600 --> 06:55.360]  And therefore, it was like they knew what I had.
[06:55.360 --> 06:57.320]  And it came right out of the oven into the box.
[06:57.320 --> 06:58.040]  Here you go, John.
[06:58.040 --> 06:59.000]  Here's your two pies.
[06:59.000 --> 07:00.960]  And I was on my way with fresh hot.
[07:00.960 --> 07:05.800]  I'd rather wait and have fresh hot pizza than get a cold pizza.
[07:05.800 --> 07:06.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[07:06.520 --> 07:09.880]  There's a couple places that do this, but one place
[07:09.880 --> 07:13.080]  that's like a Thai fusion sort of place close to us that we go to.
[07:13.080 --> 07:15.080]  If you pull up in the parking lot and call them,
[07:15.080 --> 07:17.480]  they'll bring it right out to you so you don't even have to go in.
[07:17.480 --> 07:18.120]  Yeah, yeah.
[07:18.120 --> 07:19.400]  There's a couple places that do.
[07:19.400 --> 07:24.680]  I mean, in Philly, where we are, it's so pedestrian oriented.
[07:24.680 --> 07:25.640]  But it is weird, too.
[07:25.640 --> 07:30.080]  There's a lot of people who are like recreationally driving,
[07:30.080 --> 07:32.040]  cruising clearly.
[07:32.040 --> 07:34.560]  Well, I've had to start doing that because my car won't start.
[07:34.560 --> 07:39.160]  If I don't take recreational drives and then I go to the grocery store
[07:39.160 --> 07:42.600]  every two weeks, the car has to jumpstart the car again.
[07:42.600 --> 07:44.600]  You know this from the ones like we're on.
[07:44.600 --> 07:49.560]  My car died and couldn't even be jumpstarted.
[07:49.560 --> 07:52.040]  It died, died, died.
[07:52.040 --> 07:55.400]  And it was an old-ish battery that I don't
[07:55.400 --> 07:58.520]  think I would have had to replace if I'd been driving normally.
[07:58.520 --> 08:02.680]  We don't even drive that much ordinarily, but we don't drive enough.
[08:02.680 --> 08:05.200]  And I was like, this is ridiculous.
[08:05.200 --> 08:06.840]  There's no way that it's been that long.
[08:06.840 --> 08:09.280]  And then I was like, well, wait.
[08:09.280 --> 08:13.400]  I definitely drove the car at Easter to pick up food on Easter Sunday.
[08:13.400 --> 08:15.160]  And I was like, how long ago was Easter?
[08:15.160 --> 08:16.320]  And I did the hey dingus.
[08:16.320 --> 08:18.400]  Hey dingus, how long ago was Easter?
[08:18.400 --> 08:20.600]  And it was like six weeks.
[08:20.600 --> 08:23.720]  It was like over six weeks where I hadn't even started the car.
[08:23.720 --> 08:29.400]  And I was like, oh, yeah, I guess that wasn't two weeks ago.
[08:29.400 --> 08:30.560]  Yeah, I did the same thing.
[08:30.560 --> 08:32.400]  And I feel sorry for the car, like the Roomba.
[08:32.400 --> 08:34.320]  The car should make a sad noise because I haven't
[08:34.320 --> 08:35.520]  been paying attention to it.
[08:35.520 --> 08:41.840]  Yeah, we have this great little startup thing here called 1-900 Ice Cream.
[08:41.840 --> 08:44.080]  I actually don't even know if the phone number works,
[08:44.080 --> 08:49.400]  but they started somebody maybe old enough to remember 1-900 numbers,
[08:49.400 --> 08:54.720]  which, again, in hindsight, wow, what a kooky idea that was.
[08:54.720 --> 09:01.720]  You call a number and pay to listen to stuff.
[09:01.720 --> 09:04.840]  But they don't have a permanent retail spot.
[09:04.840 --> 09:11.120]  And so what they've been doing, and I hope I'm getting the story right.
[09:11.120 --> 09:12.160]  Amy tends to handle it.
[09:12.160 --> 09:17.920]  But I think that they just make fresh batch, small batch ice creams week
[09:17.920 --> 09:22.200]  to week, and when they have ice cream ready to go, they announce it.
[09:22.200 --> 09:26.320]  And then you have to quick jump and order, and then you go pick it up.
[09:26.320 --> 09:30.920]  But they know a bunch of people in the industry because they often,
[09:30.920 --> 09:34.280]  I guess they make ice cream for restaurants, too.
[09:34.280 --> 09:37.280]  And they've just sort of been bouncing between spots
[09:37.280 --> 09:40.560]  that like restaurants that aren't open, and so they
[09:40.560 --> 09:42.120]  could take the spot for a month.
[09:42.120 --> 09:45.720]  And now they're out in a neighborhood four or five miles
[09:45.720 --> 09:47.200]  from Center City, Philadelphia.
[09:47.200 --> 09:49.000]  Not far, four or five miles.
[09:49.000 --> 09:51.120]  And Amy's like, I don't know if you want to go out there.
[09:51.120 --> 09:53.600]  I'm like, no, no, no, get all the ice cream now,
[09:53.600 --> 09:59.640]  because I need a four or five mile drive to charge the battery up.
[09:59.640 --> 10:02.720]  I don't even care about this ice cream that's making me fat.
[10:02.720 --> 10:05.360]  Even though it is delicious, it's absolutely delicious,
[10:05.360 --> 10:08.520]  and they're a delightful small company, and I'm happy to buy it.
[10:08.520 --> 10:11.960]  I was like, I just need a reason to drive the car.
[10:11.960 --> 10:13.920]  And this is where my life is, you know what I mean?
[10:13.920 --> 10:17.800]  And it's like, there's a lot worse problems out there.
[10:17.800 --> 10:20.280]  I drive down by the waterfront of Tacoma,
[10:20.280 --> 10:22.040]  which is a really nice drive.
[10:22.040 --> 10:27.240]  And also, you can see other people who are being unsafe,
[10:27.240 --> 10:30.440]  and you can be really judgy about it.
[10:30.440 --> 10:35.240]  I get two kicks at the cat with that one.
[10:35.240 --> 10:35.720]  All right.
[10:35.720 --> 10:39.880]  My thought is, we got the holiday week coming up.
[10:39.880 --> 10:42.640]  Have you guys, I mean, I haven't gone anywhere.
[10:42.640 --> 10:45.160]  Ben and I were talking about this on dithering for a bit.
[10:45.160 --> 10:48.000]  It's like, somehow the whole summer's coming past,
[10:48.000 --> 10:49.960]  and we didn't really take a vacation.
[10:49.960 --> 10:54.640]  And it's so totally like my weirdo job,
[10:54.640 --> 10:59.400]  put a parentheses S behind it, of doing my site and podcasts.
[10:59.400 --> 11:03.440]  It's like, I don't really need a vacation the way people would.
[11:03.440 --> 11:05.760]  Again, my old coal miner grandfather
[11:05.760 --> 11:09.520]  who died when I was in first grade of black lung disease,
[11:09.520 --> 11:11.680]  he probably could have used vacations for me.
[11:11.680 --> 11:13.440]  But there is a sort of burnout.
[11:13.440 --> 11:15.240]  It's like, all of a sudden, it's like, hey,
[11:15.240 --> 11:18.360]  I've been working six days a week and writing nonstop
[11:18.360 --> 11:19.200]  for six months.
[11:19.200 --> 11:23.880]  Maybe I should take it easy for a week.
[11:23.880 --> 11:26.920]  It doesn't seem like a vacation, but maybe a slow week.
[11:26.920 --> 11:27.840]  I don't know.
[11:27.840 --> 11:30.840]  I mean, yeah, eventually you need to reset your mind
[11:30.840 --> 11:32.000]  a little bit, right?
[11:32.000 --> 11:33.400]  I guess, I think.
[11:33.400 --> 11:36.080]  It certainly feels like maybe that.
[11:36.080 --> 11:38.120]  But anyway, I thought we could do a lighthearted show
[11:38.120 --> 11:41.120]  and not worry about stuff like that.
[11:41.120 --> 11:41.960]  We bought a pool.
[11:41.960 --> 11:45.440]  We bought an above-ground pool for the summer,
[11:45.440 --> 11:48.160]  which has been great.
[11:48.160 --> 11:52.520]  And here is a terrible place to have a pool,
[11:52.520 --> 11:54.840]  because there's basically two months out of the year
[11:54.840 --> 11:56.640]  that you're going to be able to use it.
[11:56.640 --> 11:58.360]  And we're quickly approaching.
[11:58.360 --> 12:01.560]  And we got it in a little bit late, because it was hard.
[12:01.560 --> 12:04.000]  I mean, I did all the work for myself, basically.
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.440]  But you got to flatten the, my yard was not flat.
[12:09.440 --> 12:12.000]  And you got to flatten it out, because otherwise, the thing
[12:12.000 --> 12:12.880]  will just tip over.
[12:12.880 --> 12:16.280]  So now, definitely, I did a lot more work
[12:16.280 --> 12:17.640]  than I thought it was going to be.
[12:17.640 --> 12:19.560]  How do you flatten a yard?
[12:19.560 --> 12:22.280]  I mean, so you just have to start digging.
[12:22.280 --> 12:25.360]  And you get a board, and you put a level on the board.
[12:25.360 --> 12:29.400]  And so you can get the distance of the whole board
[12:29.400 --> 12:30.360]  to see if it's level.
[12:30.360 --> 12:33.160]  And you just keep going around until you get it close enough.
[12:33.160 --> 12:36.840]  And it's supposed to be within an inch the whole way around.
[12:36.840 --> 12:39.520]  And I think I got about that close.
[12:39.520 --> 12:42.320]  I'm still completely nervous that I'm going to wake up one
[12:42.320 --> 12:44.640]  day, and the side busted open, and the whole thing
[12:44.640 --> 12:46.920]  spilled all over the yard.
[12:46.920 --> 12:48.360]  Because we got a good size.
[12:48.360 --> 12:51.400]  We got like a 15 foot.
[12:51.400 --> 12:53.760]  Because we wanted to be able to have other people over,
[12:53.760 --> 12:56.080]  and be 15 feet apart from each other,
[12:56.080 --> 12:57.320]  and have you be in the pool.
[12:57.320 --> 13:01.680]  We only have done that a couple of times, which was nice.
[13:01.680 --> 13:04.200]  And it's a great thing for Hank, because Hank loves to swim.
[13:04.200 --> 13:05.360]  He loves to be in the water.
[13:05.360 --> 13:09.200]  So it's a good way for him to get out of the house.
[13:09.200 --> 13:12.160]  Oh, that seems luxurious.
[13:12.160 --> 13:14.320]  Well, so now we're facing, now I got
[13:14.320 --> 13:15.640]  to deal with it for the winter.
[13:15.640 --> 13:17.720]  And I don't know what to do.
[13:17.720 --> 13:19.400]  Just move.
[13:19.400 --> 13:22.120]  Yeah, I think that's probably the easier way.
[13:22.120 --> 13:25.800]  Put the house over sale.
[13:25.800 --> 13:27.360]  Includes pool.
[13:27.360 --> 13:31.000]  No, well, like I said, we drive the value down.
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.520]  So the other funny thing about going out to eat yesterday
[13:33.520 --> 13:37.320]  was everything closes earlier.
[13:37.320 --> 13:38.960]  It's like places close at 8.
[13:38.960 --> 13:42.920]  And I don't know about you, if a place says they close at 8,
[13:42.920 --> 13:44.880]  I don't want to get a reservation
[13:44.880 --> 13:46.320]  in the last half hour.
[13:46.320 --> 13:48.080]  It always feels like you're imposing.
[13:48.080 --> 13:49.720]  And it's not like a selfish, oh, I
[13:49.720 --> 13:51.120]  think they might run out of stuff.
[13:51.120 --> 13:53.160]  It just feels like, you know.
[13:53.160 --> 13:55.040]  You don't want to be the last person in there.
[13:55.040 --> 13:58.600]  Yeah, I don't like to be the last person in a restaurant.
[13:58.600 --> 14:02.040]  Last person in a bar, a little different.
[14:02.040 --> 14:03.280]  That'll do.
[14:03.280 --> 14:04.800]  Yeah, they'll just push you out.
[14:04.800 --> 14:05.920]  You know what I mean?
[14:05.920 --> 14:06.800]  There's no problem.
[14:06.800 --> 14:12.520]  The last person in a restaurant, they don't want to be rude.
[14:12.520 --> 14:14.080]  So we ate at 6.15.
[14:14.080 --> 14:17.680]  And part of the novelty of the whole thing
[14:17.680 --> 14:22.000]  was I don't think we've ever eaten in a restaurant at 6.15
[14:22.000 --> 14:27.280]  other than a wedding or something.
[14:27.280 --> 14:30.880]  But not like, hey, let's us the family go eat.
[14:30.880 --> 14:31.680]  And we got out.
[14:31.680 --> 14:34.960]  And it's like 7.30, quarter to 8.
[14:34.960 --> 14:37.480]  And it's like, wait, why am I full?
[14:37.480 --> 14:39.640]  What is going on here?
[14:39.640 --> 14:40.280]  Am I retired?
[14:40.280 --> 14:42.480]  In your schedule, that was probably like lunch, right?
[14:42.480 --> 14:44.120]  Yeah.
[14:44.120 --> 14:47.520]  But it felt like, maybe we should move to Florida,
[14:47.520 --> 14:48.080]  go to Boca.
[14:50.800 --> 14:54.640]  Because then we'll be closing places out by eating at 6.15.
[14:54.640 --> 14:56.000]  Yeah.
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.280]  It's further north up here.
[14:57.280 --> 15:01.080]  And we get a big difference between sunlight in the summer
[15:01.080 --> 15:03.160]  and sunlight the rest of the year.
[15:03.160 --> 15:06.240]  And it's already started.
[15:06.240 --> 15:12.440]  So it'll be light until almost 10 o'clock some days during the summer.
[15:12.440 --> 15:16.440]  So yeah, they can't start the fireworks at least until 10 o'clock
[15:16.440 --> 15:17.560]  on 4th of July.
[15:17.560 --> 15:20.280]  Not that there were any this year.
[15:20.280 --> 15:23.520]  So now we were getting into, it's getting towards September,
[15:23.520 --> 15:26.800]  it's noticeably different.
[15:26.800 --> 15:29.680]  So we went and walked the dogs last night at like 8.20.
[15:29.680 --> 15:30.760]  And it was dark already.
[15:30.760 --> 15:31.260]  Yeah.
[15:31.260 --> 15:34.080]  And that was just like, man, this is really
[15:34.080 --> 15:37.120]  starting to feel like it's fall now.
[15:37.120 --> 15:40.080]  And it always does when it gets dark.
[15:40.080 --> 15:42.560]  But it feels like we didn't really have a summer.
[15:42.560 --> 15:45.280]  I mean, the other thing I noticed at dinner last night at 6.15
[15:45.280 --> 15:46.680]  is I was looking at Jonas.
[15:46.680 --> 15:52.920]  And I was like, man, you really have not gotten out this summer.
[15:52.920 --> 15:54.160]  He doesn't look unhealthy.
[15:54.160 --> 15:58.200]  But he definitely looks like a kid who has spent an entire summer
[15:58.200 --> 16:00.560]  indoors playing video games.
[16:00.560 --> 16:03.600]  Yeah, and that is pretty much, I mean, other than go out to the pool,
[16:03.600 --> 16:06.880]  Hank has been inside from almost all the summer.
[16:06.880 --> 16:09.560]  Yeah, and he wore sunglasses throughout the meal.
[16:09.560 --> 16:14.080]  And I thought, you're just being a jerk, you're trying to look cool.
[16:14.080 --> 16:15.400]  Is it his sunglasses or anything?
[16:15.400 --> 16:16.960]  Or maybe have your eyes.
[16:16.960 --> 16:18.520]  Yeah, right.
[16:18.520 --> 16:21.280]  We're turning into vampires.
[16:21.280 --> 16:24.000]  Yeah, have you done vampire-like damage to your eyes
[16:24.000 --> 16:25.600]  and your light sensitivity?
[16:25.600 --> 16:26.280]  I don't know.
[16:26.280 --> 16:28.640]  All right, let me take a break here to thank our first sponsor.
[16:28.640 --> 16:29.520]  It's our good friends.

[17:34.480 --> 17:38.560]  But one of the best things that we've enjoyed about HelloFresh
[17:38.560 --> 17:41.400]  is the variety and just like, hey, that sounds good,
[17:41.400 --> 17:44.080]  but that's not the sort of thing we usually make.
[17:44.080 --> 17:49.920]  And those sort of recipes have been like the big hits of using it.
[17:49.920 --> 17:51.200]  It really has been.
[17:51.200 --> 17:53.000]  But they really do have stuff for everyone.
[17:53.000 --> 17:58.480]  Low-calorie stuff, vegetarian options, and kid-friendly recipes.
[17:58.480 --> 18:02.600]  They totally get it when you have kids that it's different.
[18:02.600 --> 18:03.960]  And they totally get it.
[18:03.960 --> 18:07.920]  They have kid-friendly recipes that truly are kid-friendly.

[19:05.120 --> 19:08.560]  My thanks to HelloFresh for sponsoring the talk show.
[19:08.560 --> 19:10.920]  All right, this is why I want to talk to you, John.
[19:10.920 --> 19:11.560]  We got to go.
[19:11.560 --> 19:12.640]  We got to do this.
[19:12.640 --> 19:13.400]  I got to dig in.
[19:13.400 --> 19:14.120]  I got to rant.
[19:14.120 --> 19:17.040]  The main event.
[19:17.040 --> 19:22.880]  So 18 months ago for Christmas, we got Jonas a gaming PC.
[19:22.880 --> 19:25.280]  You and I have talked about this.
[19:25.280 --> 19:33.800]  I feel like you and I are long suffering fathers of children with PCs.
[19:33.800 --> 19:35.240]  All right.
[19:35.240 --> 19:37.760]  And again, it's not like I'm one of those people who ever
[19:37.760 --> 19:41.760]  spelled Windows with D-O-Z-E at the end.
[19:41.760 --> 19:42.640]  But I used it.
[19:42.640 --> 19:48.200]  I had to work using Windows computers when I was in the 90s
[19:48.200 --> 19:50.000]  and coming out of college.
[19:50.000 --> 19:50.480]  I knew it.
[19:50.480 --> 19:52.240]  I really found it distasteful.
[19:52.240 --> 19:54.720]  I was like, this is so gross.
[19:54.720 --> 19:58.680]  And so I've never bought one.
[19:58.680 --> 20:03.400]  I got an Xbox, like the original one circa 2000,
[20:03.400 --> 20:07.040]  which let you play PC era games on the Xbox.
[20:07.040 --> 20:08.360]  I like video games.
[20:08.360 --> 20:11.400]  I don't really play them much anymore, but I did when I was younger.
[20:11.400 --> 20:12.560]  Never bought a PC.
[20:12.560 --> 20:14.920]  Never owned one.
[20:14.920 --> 20:17.760]  Told Jonas, look, all right, I get it.
[20:17.760 --> 20:18.320]  You want one.
[20:18.320 --> 20:20.440]  I'm not trying to talk you out of it.
[20:20.440 --> 20:27.760]  But this is the biggest, nicest thing you're ever going to get from me.
[20:27.760 --> 20:30.120]  I don't know a lot about this.
[20:30.120 --> 20:34.640]  You're going to have to take some responsibility here
[20:34.640 --> 20:36.480]  on knowing how to manage this.
[20:36.480 --> 20:38.480]  I mean, I'll certainly try to help you out.
[20:38.480 --> 20:43.520]  It's not like I'm going to say I'm not going to touch it.
[20:43.520 --> 20:44.960]  And it's been great.
[20:44.960 --> 20:47.280]  That's what you got him?
[20:47.280 --> 20:51.600]  We got something from MSI, I forget, Trident.
[20:51.600 --> 20:52.120]  I don't know.
[20:52.120 --> 20:53.840]  So it wasn't a build your own thing.
[20:53.840 --> 20:55.720]  We got a pre-configured thing.
[20:55.720 --> 20:57.400]  And I know that that's up there.
[20:57.400 --> 20:58.640]  And I did a lot of research.
[20:58.640 --> 20:59.680]  We did a lot of research.
[20:59.680 --> 21:04.440]  But I didn't want to build it, and he didn't really want to build it.
[21:04.440 --> 21:07.560]  And it seemed like if we get one that just all comes put together,
[21:07.560 --> 21:09.720]  then we know it all works together.
[21:09.720 --> 21:15.960]  And we've both been very happy with it to date.
[21:15.960 --> 21:24.080]  Maxed out on the graphics card, which is the core of our problem.
[21:24.080 --> 21:27.840]  Anyway, it was great for 16 months out of 18 months.
[21:27.840 --> 21:31.280]  And then, I don't know, I guess it was about a month ago.
[21:31.280 --> 21:37.320]  Who knows in corona time, four or five weeks ago, Jonas says.
[21:37.320 --> 21:40.480]  I think maybe water got in my PC.
[21:43.160 --> 21:44.760]  By itself?
[21:44.760 --> 21:47.160]  Well, it's on the ground.
[21:47.160 --> 21:51.320]  And there's been, it's like a weird thing.
[21:51.320 --> 21:54.920]  You think like, well, that's not how leaky windows work, right?
[21:54.920 --> 21:58.040]  Where one time there's rain, and he gets a little bit of water
[21:58.040 --> 21:59.080]  in through a window.
[21:59.080 --> 22:00.440]  And then it never happens again.
[22:00.440 --> 22:02.880]  And so you can't really identify what the hell is going on.
[22:02.880 --> 22:05.000]  But that's sort of what happened.
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.080]  Where it's like, yeah, there's like a weird rain.
[22:07.080 --> 22:08.640]  This is a tower?
[22:08.640 --> 22:09.640]  Yeah, it's a tower.
[22:09.640 --> 22:10.960]  Yeah, OK, OK.
[22:10.960 --> 22:13.200]  It's on the ground.
[22:13.200 --> 22:16.840]  It was, you know, he puts, most nights, puts it to sleep,
[22:16.840 --> 22:19.400]  wakes up, and then starts playing games.
[22:19.400 --> 22:21.280]  Woke up, and power was off.
[22:21.280 --> 22:24.600]  And then when he turned it on, it was in a weird diagnostic mode,
[22:24.600 --> 22:28.760]  which in hindsight we realized was like the BIOS thing, which
[22:28.760 --> 22:31.480]  doesn't look like the old DOS BIOS thing anymore.
[22:31.480 --> 22:36.320]  It's like a manufacturer's thing that was graphical.
[22:36.320 --> 22:38.440]  But he tried to fix it at that point.
[22:38.440 --> 22:40.160]  So I didn't see that at that point.
[22:40.160 --> 22:42.520]  And then it didn't work.
[22:42.520 --> 22:43.560]  This is the weird thing.
[22:43.560 --> 22:47.040]  It manifested itself as working, but it was only
[22:47.040 --> 22:54.400]  driving his display at 1024 by 768, which was not right,
[22:54.400 --> 22:56.840]  and not even the right aspect ratio.
[22:56.840 --> 22:59.640]  So everything was like sort of stretched, and none of these games
[22:59.640 --> 23:02.560]  would launch.
[23:02.560 --> 23:05.160]  Windows was working, and he could do things like browse the web
[23:05.160 --> 23:05.720]  and whatever.
[23:05.720 --> 23:08.240]  It just was the display thing that was broken.
[23:08.240 --> 23:11.680]  And I was like, well, this doesn't seem like water damage at all.
[23:11.680 --> 23:13.320]  What makes you think it's water damage?
[23:13.320 --> 23:15.920]  And I'm thinking, you know, this whole thing is kaput.
[23:15.920 --> 23:19.400]  And there's nothing by his window.
[23:19.400 --> 23:21.200]  There's no signs, nothing on the floor.
[23:21.200 --> 23:22.640]  I'm like, and he's like, well, I don't know.
[23:22.640 --> 23:24.640]  I just guessed that that's what would break it.
[23:24.640 --> 23:26.480]  And I'm like, wait.
[23:26.480 --> 23:27.680]  Wait, wait, wait.
[23:27.680 --> 23:28.680]  I'm not mad.
[23:28.680 --> 23:29.800]  I'm not going to yell.
[23:29.800 --> 23:31.480]  You know, you're taking good care.
[23:31.480 --> 23:33.200]  There's no, nothing came in through the window.
[23:33.200 --> 23:34.800]  And I'm like, wait, it didn't even rain.
[23:34.800 --> 23:36.520]  I was like, did you spill something on it?
[23:36.520 --> 23:37.160]  Just tell me.
[23:37.160 --> 23:39.880]  Did you somehow spill something, even though it's off to the side?
[23:39.880 --> 23:41.440]  I'm not going to yell at you.
[23:41.440 --> 23:42.760]  You know, we'll figure it out.
[23:42.760 --> 23:43.800]  We'll fix it.
[23:43.800 --> 23:45.960]  And he's like, not that I remember.
[23:45.960 --> 23:51.280]  And I'm like, Jonas, just what do you mean not that you remember?
[23:51.280 --> 23:56.040]  If you are even suspicious, like did you like rest a can on it,
[23:56.040 --> 23:59.640]  and you're worried that the can was condensed with humidity
[23:59.640 --> 24:00.640]  and dripped into it?
[24:00.640 --> 24:03.320]  Just tell me if that's the sort of, and you're like, does that count?
[24:03.320 --> 24:07.560]  Are you trying to parse this legally?
[24:07.560 --> 24:08.280]  And he's like, no.
[24:08.280 --> 24:10.600]  And I was like, do you have any vague recollection
[24:10.600 --> 24:14.200]  of any incident like that that would involve drops of water getting
[24:14.200 --> 24:15.440]  into the top of this thing?
[24:15.440 --> 24:16.320]  And he's like, no.
[24:16.320 --> 24:18.440]  And I'm like, so it's not water damage.
[24:18.440 --> 24:21.600]  Water damage shorts electrical things out.
[24:21.600 --> 24:26.360]  They don't tend to still turn on and half work.
[24:26.360 --> 24:30.040]  And so the whole water damage thing was a complete red herring.
[24:30.040 --> 24:32.240]  It was just his, this is the level of his.
[24:32.240 --> 24:33.480]  This is idle speculation.
[24:33.480 --> 24:33.980]  Yeah.
[24:37.520 --> 24:39.840]  So we start digging around.
[24:39.840 --> 24:46.320]  And can I just tell you, Windows is so much worse than it ever was.
[24:46.320 --> 24:50.040]  On the surface level, it's like I thought, well, maybe it's gotten better.
[24:50.040 --> 24:51.960]  People say it's gotten better.
[24:51.960 --> 24:54.000]  It kind of looks better.
[24:54.000 --> 24:59.640]  But it's so much worse than it ever was back in the day when I had to use it.
[24:59.640 --> 25:00.520]  It's horrible.
[25:00.520 --> 25:04.480]  Windows is a goddamn criminal nightmare.
[25:04.480 --> 25:10.080]  And in my mind, I have, and for years I own the Pixel phones.
[25:10.080 --> 25:11.800]  And I used to have a Nexus.
[25:11.800 --> 25:14.440]  I try to stay up to date with the Android thing.
[25:14.440 --> 25:18.640]  And in my mind, I've always sort of thought, well, Android is to iOS
[25:18.640 --> 25:20.360]  as Windows was to the Mac.
[25:20.360 --> 25:22.000]  And there's things I see in Android.
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.640]  I'm like, this is just so distasteful.
[25:24.640 --> 25:26.480]  It's that Steve Jobs line about Bill Gates.
[25:26.480 --> 25:29.080]  That his problem is he just has no taste.
[25:29.080 --> 25:35.040]  I say, this is just, but it's like, Android is so much better and more
[25:35.040 --> 25:41.960]  tastefully designed than Windows, to mobile devices than Windows is to PCs
[25:41.960 --> 25:48.240]  that it's like, I can't even, I can't even, John, I can't even.
[25:48.240 --> 25:50.200]  Well, part of the thing that's really frustrating
[25:50.200 --> 25:52.680]  when you start to diagnose a Windows problem
[25:52.680 --> 25:57.680]  is that there's different places to look now.
[25:57.680 --> 25:59.840]  Because it used to be, you go to the control panels,
[25:59.840 --> 26:02.080]  like everything was in the control panel section.
[26:02.080 --> 26:03.520]  I mean, I may be using the wrong words.
[26:03.520 --> 26:04.240]  No, that's it.
[26:04.240 --> 26:04.760]  That's it.
[26:04.760 --> 26:06.800]  I think it's control panels, right?
[26:06.800 --> 26:12.920]  But now, there's like a system preferences interface, which
[26:12.920 --> 26:17.320]  I believe came about, actually, I'm pretty sure it came about during Windows 8
[26:17.320 --> 26:19.680]  when they were trying to do touch-based screens,
[26:19.680 --> 26:23.360]  so that you have this thing that has much bigger touch targets
[26:23.360 --> 26:27.080]  so that you can use it with a tablet, in a tablet form factor.
[26:27.080 --> 26:30.520]  But when you really want to do anything that's actually
[26:30.520 --> 26:36.400]  going to help fix your device, you've got to go into the control panels.
[26:36.400 --> 26:41.400]  And that's still the same basic thing that it was under XP.
[26:41.400 --> 26:42.280]  Yes.
[26:42.280 --> 26:43.400]  Yes.
[26:43.400 --> 26:45.200]  It's all still there.
[26:45.200 --> 26:47.760]  But it's not the thing that, but you have to find that, right?
[26:47.760 --> 26:50.280]  You can't, like, it's not a menu item.
[26:50.280 --> 26:53.760]  The menu item thing is the system preferences,
[26:53.760 --> 26:56.000]  which is like a bunch of basic settings.
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.040]  But everything where you really configure the guts of the machine
[26:59.040 --> 27:01.920]  is under the control panels.
[27:01.920 --> 27:06.360]  And you have to, like, search to find that every single time, at least I do.
[27:06.360 --> 27:08.200]  You have to go in.
[27:08.200 --> 27:10.280]  I swear to God, I'll put this in the show notes,
[27:10.280 --> 27:13.520]  but it's like you've got to go into the Run menu.
[27:13.520 --> 27:18.800]  And it's just like launching a CD-ROM in 1996, where you've got
[27:18.800 --> 27:21.640]  to type the exact right incantation.
[27:21.640 --> 27:27.080]  It's like you've got to type, like, D-E-V-M-G-M-T something in a dev
[27:27.080 --> 27:27.800]  management.
[27:27.800 --> 27:31.720]  And it's only, it's like, oh my God, we're back at the seven character file names.
[27:31.720 --> 27:36.320]  Like, we're at that level of DOS rot.
[27:36.320 --> 27:43.960]  Like, in a sense, like, actually having my son, whom I love,
[27:43.960 --> 27:49.240]  and who truly did and does take care of his PC,
[27:49.240 --> 27:54.000]  and who really does enjoy it, and it's a big part of his social life
[27:54.000 --> 27:59.440]  in normal times and the entirety of his social life in corona times,
[27:59.440 --> 28:03.360]  I really wanted to help fix it.
[28:03.360 --> 28:05.920]  Whatever it takes, if we need to spend our way out of it,
[28:05.920 --> 28:07.120]  we'll spend our way out of it.
[28:07.120 --> 28:10.360]  It's important.
[28:10.360 --> 28:13.400]  This is such a pile of heap of garbage.
[28:13.400 --> 28:17.080]  Again, in a sense, it is almost impressive the way
[28:17.080 --> 28:20.200]  that their strategy of managing technical debt
[28:20.200 --> 28:28.680]  is to keep architecting ways to haul all of it with them in, like,
[28:28.680 --> 28:31.160]  this Dante's Inferno-esque.
[28:31.160 --> 28:33.480]  We will leave no setting behind.
[28:33.480 --> 28:36.040]  Right, like, multiple layers of hell.
[28:36.040 --> 28:39.880]  Like, you think you're in hell just going through their settings app,
[28:39.880 --> 28:43.560]  but then you realize you've got to go back to the control panel.
[28:43.560 --> 28:48.520]  And then, eventually, you're back in the registry, and it's 1993 again.
[28:52.280 --> 28:56.280]  I kind of knew this was the case from helping him set the PC up,
[28:56.280 --> 29:00.040]  that there were even just setting it up when everything was new
[29:00.040 --> 29:02.920]  and working properly, and we needed to do a few things.
[29:02.920 --> 29:08.200]  Like, there was a courtesy copy of a Norton or something
[29:08.200 --> 29:09.480]  that was set to auto-run.
[29:09.480 --> 29:11.400]  And it's like, well, let's figure out how to get rid of this,
[29:11.400 --> 29:12.760]  because you don't need it.
[29:12.760 --> 29:16.120]  And let's just get this Microsoft's own Windows Defender set up.
[29:16.120 --> 29:19.000]  That seems like what you want to, you know, that's all you need.
[29:20.760 --> 29:23.080]  And even just setting it up, you kind of have to,
[29:23.080 --> 29:24.120]  you still can't get out.
[29:24.120 --> 29:26.600]  You can't just sit on the modern surface layer.
[29:26.600 --> 29:28.840]  But this is seriously, like, at a technical debt layer,
[29:28.840 --> 29:33.560]  this is like you're back at some point going back on the Mac,
[29:33.560 --> 29:36.520]  and, like, Susan Kerr's control panel is still there.
[29:38.760 --> 29:39.560]  You know what I mean?
[29:39.560 --> 29:43.960]  Like, you're looking at black and white Chicago 12 pixel font.
[29:43.960 --> 29:47.320]  There used to be, for a long time, there was something,
[29:47.320 --> 29:49.640]  like, if you started in recovery, what was that?
[29:49.640 --> 29:52.440]  Where it had, like, the OS 9 style.
[29:53.640 --> 29:54.600]  There was, yeah.
[29:54.600 --> 29:57.400]  It was like that got dragged forward for a long time,
[29:57.400 --> 29:59.720]  but that's not, I don't think that exists anymore.
[30:00.680 --> 30:02.680]  Or maybe I'm thinking of the tools,
[30:04.440 --> 30:08.840]  you'd get that CD that had the hardware diagnostic tool.
[30:08.840 --> 30:12.600]  It was called, like, the hardware diagnostic tool,
[30:12.600 --> 30:13.240]  and it did.
[30:13.240 --> 30:15.480]  It wasn't Mac OS.
[30:15.480 --> 30:16.840]  It was some weird.
[30:16.840 --> 30:18.200]  It was something made to look like it.
[30:18.200 --> 30:19.960]  Yeah, something made to look like it.
[30:19.960 --> 30:23.160]  Whereas this actually is the old Windows XP
[30:23.160 --> 30:27.080]  running under the hood with just a veneer on top,
[30:27.080 --> 30:29.560]  which is all the way back strategically.
[30:29.560 --> 30:31.720]  It's exactly what Windows was at the beginning.
[30:31.720 --> 30:33.880]  Windows was just a DOS program.
[30:33.880 --> 30:36.360]  It was, you know, if you recall, you would just type,
[30:36.360 --> 30:40.520]  you'd boot into DOS and type win to get into Windows.
[30:40.520 --> 30:43.720]  And, you know, when people bought a computer that launched,
[30:43.720 --> 30:45.320]  quote, unquote, launched into Windows,
[30:45.320 --> 30:47.720]  it was just an auto-exempt bat file
[30:47.720 --> 30:49.800]  that had the win command in it.
[30:49.800 --> 30:50.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[30:52.120 --> 30:53.800]  I ran a small office back then.
[30:53.800 --> 30:57.640]  Yeah, we had Windows 3.1 for work groups,
[30:57.640 --> 31:00.040]  3.1.1 or something like that.
[31:00.040 --> 31:01.640]  Yeah, that was a trip.
[31:02.600 --> 31:05.480]  So anyway, what it is, is we figured this out.
[31:05.480 --> 31:07.160]  We're in the control panel.
[31:07.160 --> 31:12.600]  We find the Nvidia GeForce GTX, whatever,
[31:12.600 --> 31:15.000]  2080 is his video card.
[31:15.640 --> 31:18.120]  And you go to general and it would say,
[31:21.320 --> 31:23.400]  here, I have a screenshot, I'll read it.
[31:23.400 --> 31:25.080]  Windows has stopped this device
[31:25.080 --> 31:28.520]  because it has reported problems, parentheses,
[31:28.520 --> 31:31.400]  code 43, end parentheses.
[31:31.400 --> 31:36.520]  And it was another way to tell that the video
[31:36.520 --> 31:38.520]  was being driven by something called
[31:38.520 --> 31:40.920]  like the Windows default driver.
[31:40.920 --> 31:42.680]  And it's some kind of generic thing
[31:42.680 --> 31:44.200]  built into the low level of Windows.
[31:44.200 --> 31:47.880]  So in other words, even though we never unplugged
[31:47.880 --> 31:51.400]  his display and put it into a different port
[31:51.400 --> 31:53.560]  on the back of his PC, because there's a bunch of them,
[31:53.560 --> 31:58.440]  because there's so many, because he put a video card in
[31:58.440 --> 32:02.440]  and then the video card has two DisplayPort ports
[32:02.440 --> 32:03.720]  and an HDMI port.
[32:03.720 --> 32:05.800]  But then there's one on the motherboard
[32:05.800 --> 32:07.480]  that has a plug in it, because it's like,
[32:07.480 --> 32:09.000]  don't use this one, because that's just
[32:09.000 --> 32:10.360]  the dumb one on the motherboard.
[32:12.360 --> 32:13.800]  But we never unplugged anything.
[32:13.800 --> 32:16.040]  So it was still plugged into the same thing
[32:16.040 --> 32:18.120]  that used to be driving it as this advanced,
[32:18.120 --> 32:20.680]  expensive Nvidia GeForce gaming card,
[32:20.680 --> 32:21.480]  but now it wasn't.
[32:21.480 --> 32:24.520]  But it was that the driver Windows was using
[32:24.520 --> 32:26.680]  was no longer the Nvidia driver.
[32:26.680 --> 32:29.240]  It was this default driver.
[32:29.240 --> 32:31.160]  And now, all right, this makes some level of sense.
[32:31.160 --> 32:34.200]  This is why it's a 1024 by 768.
[32:34.200 --> 32:37.960]  And none of your games, it doesn't even come close
[32:37.960 --> 32:40.280]  to meeting the minimum specs of any game
[32:40.280 --> 32:44.920]  other than maybe Minesweeper, which is still there.
[32:44.920 --> 32:45.960]  Oh no, it's not still there.
[32:45.960 --> 32:48.280]  They got rid of Minesweeper, which is criminal.
[32:48.280 --> 32:50.520]  Yeah, I think they make you pay for all the old games
[32:50.520 --> 32:52.200]  that they used to play for free.
[32:52.200 --> 32:52.680]  I forgot.
[32:52.680 --> 32:55.160]  We did, Jonas and I were playing Minesweeper,
[32:55.160 --> 32:57.560]  but the best way to get it now is through Google.
[32:57.560 --> 32:59.400]  You just go to Google and type Minesweeper,
[32:59.400 --> 33:00.920]  and they have a web-based version.
[33:02.280 --> 33:03.880]  But I was teaching them how to play real games,
[33:03.880 --> 33:04.680]  like Minesweeper.
[33:06.600 --> 33:08.600]  So OK, code 43.
[33:08.600 --> 33:10.440]  This is something to go on.
[33:10.440 --> 33:12.280]  This isn't helpful, but you go on it.
[33:12.280 --> 33:15.640]  And you go, and I'll put it in the show notes.
[33:15.640 --> 33:17.720]  It's a really helpful article, truly is,
[33:18.520 --> 33:22.520]  at a site called, what's this site called, Crazy Web Studio.
[33:22.520 --> 33:31.160]  How to Solve Code 43, NVIDIA GTX 10XX or RTX 20XX.
[33:31.160 --> 33:32.680]  It's a whole bunch of video cards
[33:32.680 --> 33:35.160]  that have that naming scheme GPU problem.
[33:36.360 --> 33:42.520]  And there's ways you can run it, techniques to go through.
[33:42.520 --> 33:45.720]  Completely uninstall all the NVIDIA device drivers,
[33:45.720 --> 33:47.320]  and reinstall them from NVIDIA.
[33:48.440 --> 33:49.000]  Reboot.
[33:49.880 --> 33:50.440]  Didn't work.
[33:50.440 --> 33:53.800]  Start using some scripts that people have written,
[33:53.800 --> 33:57.640]  and it seems that people swear by them,
[33:57.640 --> 33:59.800]  and there's enough people, and you can kind of say,
[33:59.800 --> 34:02.040]  you're not just running a truly random script.
[34:02.040 --> 34:07.560]  But it's like a bat file, and it deletes, delete, deletes.
[34:07.560 --> 34:11.400]  Super deletes the drivers, because I guess what they have
[34:11.400 --> 34:13.240]  to do is get into the registry.
[34:13.240 --> 34:20.280]  And the registry is still like the Yoda's Dagobah
[34:20.280 --> 34:21.720]  cave of the dark side.
[34:24.920 --> 34:27.240]  Everything's sort of dream-like in there.
[34:28.040 --> 34:30.920]  Anyway, the script, people swear by it that it works,
[34:30.920 --> 34:33.240]  then reinstall them, and it might work.
[34:33.880 --> 34:34.920]  That didn't solve it.
[34:36.040 --> 34:38.760]  So I thought, well, this is, and then you get there.
[34:38.760 --> 34:41.720]  And here's the, we did read that.
[34:41.720 --> 34:44.040]  I read the whole article, but it says, important.
[34:44.040 --> 34:46.520]  You also have to consider that the issue can happen
[34:46.520 --> 34:47.960]  for hardware problems.
[34:47.960 --> 34:52.120]  In some cases, the PCI card was not plugged in properly.
[34:52.120 --> 34:54.920]  In other cases, the alignment cable of the graphics card
[34:54.920 --> 34:57.720]  was not any more plugged properly.
[34:57.720 --> 35:00.440]  This is slightly broken English, perhaps.
[35:00.440 --> 35:03.240]  And in other cases, the graphic card was broken.
[35:05.720 --> 35:07.400]  This doesn't make any sense to me,
[35:07.400 --> 35:09.400]  that if the graphics card is broken,
[35:09.400 --> 35:13.320]  that it's still working in some low mode.
[35:13.320 --> 35:17.880]  Well, wouldn't it default back to whatever the graphics are
[35:17.880 --> 35:19.080]  that are included on the Intel?
[35:19.720 --> 35:21.640]  Well, but it's not plugged into it, right?
[35:23.000 --> 35:25.480]  How would the display be getting this
[35:25.480 --> 35:28.600]  when it's plugged into the display port, right?
[35:29.400 --> 35:31.640]  It wasn't like, oh, we're not getting any picture
[35:31.640 --> 35:32.600]  out of this video card.
[35:32.600 --> 35:35.800]  Let's plug it into the Intel graphics port
[35:35.800 --> 35:38.840]  on this motherboard and at least get a picture
[35:38.840 --> 35:40.520]  and see if we can diagnose this.
[35:40.520 --> 35:43.560]  We never unplugged anything.
[35:43.560 --> 35:45.720]  I checked with Panzerino, who's a gamer,
[35:45.720 --> 35:49.320]  and he said that that makes some level of sense
[35:49.320 --> 35:52.760]  that the hardware card could have failed.
[35:53.560 --> 35:54.120]  It's broken.
[35:54.760 --> 35:56.280]  It's out of warranty by far.
[35:56.280 --> 35:58.760]  It's a 12-month warranty, so it's out of warranty.
[35:59.320 --> 36:03.960]  But even when it fails, it might have an emergency mode.
[36:03.960 --> 36:07.560]  This makes some level of sense at the way PC components work.
[36:07.560 --> 36:08.840]  And it's like, I guess that is.
[36:08.840 --> 36:10.920]  So to the PC world's credit,
[36:10.920 --> 36:13.400]  that is better than nothing, I guess.
[36:14.280 --> 36:16.120]  But the error message is exactly...
[36:16.120 --> 36:17.640]  It's more confusing, though.
[36:17.640 --> 36:21.080]  The error message for drivers that need to be reinstalled
[36:21.880 --> 36:25.720]  and a card that has a cataclysmic hardware failure
[36:25.720 --> 36:31.880]  or a card that isn't properly seated in the PCI slot
[36:31.880 --> 36:34.200]  are all the same, code 43.
[36:35.000 --> 36:35.800]  That's it.
[36:35.800 --> 36:36.600]  That's all you get.
[36:36.600 --> 36:39.160]  So I had the idea then of, well,
[36:39.160 --> 36:43.640]  before we order a replacement video card, which is expensive.
[36:43.640 --> 36:47.400]  It's effectively a gaming PC is just a minimal...
[36:47.400 --> 36:49.320]  It's all, yeah, it all revolves around that.
[36:49.320 --> 36:54.280]  It's a high-end video card with a computer wrapped around it, right?
[36:54.280 --> 36:55.400]  I mean, effectively.
[36:56.520 --> 36:58.760]  And I was like, don't worry, it's not your fault.
[36:58.760 --> 37:00.360]  If this broke, it's truly...
[37:01.480 --> 37:05.320]  This is what you get when you buy a cutting-edge video card.
[37:05.320 --> 37:06.440]  Cutting-edge video card.
[37:07.240 --> 37:08.840]  No, no, no harm done.
[37:08.840 --> 37:09.960]  You're not in any trouble.
[37:09.960 --> 37:11.640]  This isn't coming out of your college fund.
[37:13.800 --> 37:14.440]  Which wouldn't...
[37:14.440 --> 37:15.000]  I worry.
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.000]  You gotta go to a state school now.
[37:17.000 --> 37:17.880]  Yeah, which I worry.
[37:17.880 --> 37:19.640]  He'd be like, ah, who cares?
[37:21.880 --> 37:23.160]  I need this now.
[37:23.160 --> 37:26.040]  But I thought before we spend the money on this,
[37:26.840 --> 37:29.800]  how can we prove that it's not a software problem?
[37:29.800 --> 37:32.840]  And I thought, well, what about booting from an external drive?
[37:32.840 --> 37:37.160]  Well, that's easy on a Mac, right?
[37:37.160 --> 37:38.520]  If you have a drive.
[37:38.520 --> 37:40.520]  And we have plenty of drives in our house.
[37:41.880 --> 37:45.400]  And Windows, that is not easy at all to just say,
[37:45.400 --> 37:51.160]  I would like to install Windows on a USB drive and then boot from that drive.
[37:51.160 --> 37:51.880]  That was like a day.
[37:53.640 --> 37:57.880]  But we did get it to work, and the video was exactly the same.
[37:57.880 --> 38:06.120]  1024, 768, fresh installation of Windows, you could tell it was, right?
[38:06.120 --> 38:10.360]  It wasn't like a clone of his original C drive.
[38:10.360 --> 38:12.760]  Can you believe there's still C drives, by the way?
[38:12.760 --> 38:13.560]  C and D drives?
[38:13.560 --> 38:14.600]  Well, I mean, I know there aren't, but...
[38:16.600 --> 38:20.200]  Anyway, we had a lot of father-son time.
[38:20.200 --> 38:21.720]  So maybe this is all a good story.
[38:22.440 --> 38:25.320]  But I was like, do you know where the A and B drives are?
[38:25.880 --> 38:27.080]  And Jonas was like, no.
[38:27.080 --> 38:28.840]  And I was like, have you ever wondered?
[38:28.840 --> 38:29.560]  He said, yes.
[38:30.200 --> 38:33.720]  And I said, those are reserved for floppy drives,
[38:34.360 --> 38:38.760]  which no longer are supported by the operating system.
[38:40.440 --> 38:42.520]  And you still need it to be the C drive.
[38:42.520 --> 38:42.840]  Right.
[38:43.480 --> 38:44.600]  And he's like, no.
[38:44.600 --> 38:45.880]  And I'm like, yep.
[38:49.880 --> 38:53.720]  So anyway, long story short, we replaced the video card.
[38:54.280 --> 38:54.920]  We got it.
[38:54.920 --> 38:57.880]  It took a while because it's one of those things that still has to ship from China.
[38:58.600 --> 39:01.320]  And therefore, you know, and it's like still the way shipments are
[39:01.320 --> 39:05.800]  messed up and the quarantine world took like a week and a half or something.
[39:06.520 --> 39:07.000]  Got it.
[39:07.000 --> 39:12.440]  We learned how to replace a video card in a modern PC, which was, you know, again,
[39:12.440 --> 39:16.760]  sort of is a father-son, you know, you know, it's like, like, it's like Legos,
[39:16.760 --> 39:18.440]  except the card costs $1,000.
[39:18.440 --> 39:25.160]  So let's be careful, right?
[39:25.160 --> 39:26.440]  Just what you wanted.
[39:26.440 --> 39:27.160]  Right.
[39:27.160 --> 39:29.160]  We didn't have Legos, but much more expensive.
[39:29.960 --> 39:33.320]  And lo and behold, once we got the replacement video card in,
[39:33.320 --> 39:36.120]  hooked everything back up, closed it all up, rebooted it.
[39:36.120 --> 39:37.800]  It was all back to normal.
[39:37.800 --> 39:39.000]  So that was it.
[39:39.800 --> 39:43.240]  And did you, did you buy a different kind of card or did you buy exactly the same?
[39:43.240 --> 39:46.440]  Ah, that's, I'm so glad you asked.
[39:46.440 --> 39:48.600]  So we bought the exact same card.
[39:48.600 --> 39:51.800]  I called MSI number one, and this is weird.
[39:52.360 --> 39:57.400]  So, um, I tried their online help first because I, of course, don't like to talk
[39:57.400 --> 40:04.200]  to people on the phone and their online help was one of those things that, and they
[40:04.200 --> 40:08.600]  try to steer you to it, I guess, for obvious reasons, um, it's cheaper.
[40:08.600 --> 40:13.160]  And it's one of those things, those awful chat things on the web.
[40:13.160 --> 40:17.320]  And it's like, and they don't, and they don't answer for a while.
[40:17.320 --> 40:18.920]  You know, they'll be like, how can I help you?
[40:18.920 --> 40:21.960]  And you're like, I have an MSI trident, whatever, whatever.
[40:21.960 --> 40:24.760]  And here's, you know, and I've, I've already written a bunch of this.
[40:24.760 --> 40:27.400]  So I get pasted in, you know, and be as helpful as possible.
[40:27.800 --> 40:29.800]  Um, and they're like, oh, let me see.
[40:29.800 --> 40:33.160]  And, you know, and then of course they're worried that I want a refund or whatever.
[40:33.160 --> 40:36.040]  And I, even though it's out of warranty and I'm like, I realize it's out of warranty.
[40:36.040 --> 40:37.560]  I just want to know what I should do.
[40:38.360 --> 40:41.400]  Um, and then they don't answer for a while.
[40:41.400 --> 40:45.160]  And then it's like, they come back and they're like, if I don't hear from you in 30 seconds,
[40:45.160 --> 40:46.680]  I will consider this ticket closed.
[40:46.680 --> 40:49.560]  And it's like, wait, it's terrible.
[40:49.560 --> 40:50.520]  And they were not helpful.
[40:50.520 --> 40:53.880]  They had like a fact and it's like, ah, I found all this already.
[40:53.880 --> 40:58.440]  I called them and I talked to a nice young man, uh, possibly in Texas.
[40:58.440 --> 41:01.400]  You sounded like, you know, sort of had a distinctive.
[41:01.400 --> 41:01.960]  Yeah.
[41:01.960 --> 41:07.320]  We've had, um, Lenovo's we had, well, Hank has had a Lenovo and a Dell.
[41:07.320 --> 41:09.880]  And I think both times the people that I talked to were in Texas.
[41:09.880 --> 41:11.800]  Yeah, very helpful.
[41:11.800 --> 41:16.840]  And again, once I made it clear that I realized this is well out of the 12 month warranty
[41:16.840 --> 41:18.440]  and I don't want warranty service.
[41:18.440 --> 41:20.280]  I just want to know what's the best thing to do.
[41:21.000 --> 41:22.120]  Uh, it was very helpful.
[41:22.120 --> 41:26.200]  And we got to the conclusion of, we should, you really should just buy a new card.
[41:26.200 --> 41:28.760]  And the best card you could get is the same model.
[41:28.760 --> 41:33.640]  Uh, so I bought it again and I said to Jonas, this is a, but we shopped around and they,
[41:33.640 --> 41:35.400]  even the pictures looked a little different.
[41:35.400 --> 41:39.720]  It's still the R T R T X something 20, 80.
[41:40.360 --> 41:43.160]  Um, but it's like a rev 2.0.
[41:43.160 --> 41:49.480]  So it's the same graphics card from Nvidia, but the, and it's from the PC maker MSI.
[41:49.480 --> 41:54.040]  So it's built and, and this, you know, it was like a half inch bigger, but you have
[41:54.040 --> 41:57.320]  to be careful that, you know, cause he doesn't have like this big giant, like I said earlier
[41:57.320 --> 42:00.600]  in the story, he doesn't have a giant build your own case.
[42:00.600 --> 42:06.280]  It was an all in one enclosure, but the all in one enclosure is still sort of bigger and
[42:06.280 --> 42:11.080]  more spacious and meant for component swapping, you know, more than like an apple product.
[42:11.800 --> 42:15.880]  Um, uh, it's a totally different design though.
[42:15.880 --> 42:19.880]  It's everything about, it's like, might be the same graphic card, but even like the green,
[42:19.880 --> 42:24.040]  uh, motherboard, you know, when I look, peek through it, cause it's like, got like all
[42:24.040 --> 42:25.960]  this other stuff glommed on top of it.
[42:25.960 --> 42:26.760]  You know what I mean?
[42:26.760 --> 42:31.640]  It's, if you've ever looked at these things, you know, the fans, well, it's all fans.
[42:31.640 --> 42:32.760]  It's just a bunch of fans.
[42:33.720 --> 42:38.840]  Um, but the thing I noticed was that the heat sink was completely different.
[42:38.840 --> 42:41.560]  It's just a totally different heat sink style.
[42:41.560 --> 42:43.320]  Doesn't look like more of a heat sink.
[42:43.320 --> 42:49.400]  Doesn't look like less of a heat sink, but the, it's just totally different architecture
[42:49.400 --> 42:51.160]  of where the physical coils go.
[42:51.160 --> 42:56.600]  And I was like, probably what happened is that the old one overheated at some point
[42:56.600 --> 43:00.840]  and burned out and that they've completely redesigned it in the interim.
[43:00.840 --> 43:02.760]  And then again, panzerino said, Oh yeah.
[43:02.760 --> 43:04.360]  And he goes like, how old was it when you bought it?
[43:04.360 --> 43:05.640]  And I was like, it was like two months old.
[43:05.640 --> 43:07.080]  He was like, yeah, you bought the dumb one.
[43:10.520 --> 43:12.360]  Cause I said to him, I was like, here's the worst part.
[43:12.360 --> 43:15.000]  I was like, what if these things have an 18 month lifespan?
[43:15.000 --> 43:15.640]  You know, right.
[43:15.640 --> 43:16.680]  You're just, you're paying.
[43:16.680 --> 43:17.080]  Yeah.
[43:17.080 --> 43:18.840]  Pay you a thousand bucks every 18 months.
[43:18.840 --> 43:19.080]  Right.
[43:19.080 --> 43:23.640]  And I was like, next time we'll just, I guess, get a new PC or, you know, maybe you'll be
[43:23.640 --> 43:28.920]  18 at the time and you know, I'll just disown you.
[43:28.920 --> 43:29.480]  Good luck.
[43:32.120 --> 43:33.400]  That's my story.
[43:33.400 --> 43:40.040]  Well, we had a, we're still in the midst of a similar, like, so he has a Dell laptop now.
[43:40.040 --> 43:42.840]  He's always wanted laptops, but he still likes playing games.
[43:42.840 --> 43:48.760]  So I get, you know, I try and get a laptop with a decent graphics card and he had something,
[43:48.760 --> 43:50.920]  he claims that he thinks that it was a virus.
[43:50.920 --> 43:55.400]  I, you know, he doesn't have any idea what it was, but the hard drive, something happened
[43:55.400 --> 43:56.040]  on the hard drive.
[43:56.040 --> 44:00.440]  And so I finally got around recently to opening it up and pulling the hard drive out.
[44:00.440 --> 44:02.280]  And it is, it is wiped.
[44:02.280 --> 44:07.640]  It is not even like, it's not just empty with windows or empty with any bootable thing.
[44:07.640 --> 44:11.320]  It is like that you plug it in and it does not recognize that the drive has been formatted
[44:11.320 --> 44:11.820]  at all.
[44:12.680 --> 44:15.240]  And I, and I have not been able, I haven't tried yet.
[44:15.240 --> 44:16.680]  I mean, it could be just like damaged.
[44:16.680 --> 44:18.200]  Was this the C drive?
[44:18.200 --> 44:19.480]  It was the startup drive.
[44:19.480 --> 44:24.520]  Yeah, this was the, which was a hybrid, um, terabyte hybrid drive.
[44:24.520 --> 44:27.960]  So, you know, and I think hybrids are not necessarily the best.
[44:29.000 --> 44:35.240]  Like, I think for, uh, durability, you're better off either with a full SSD or a, or
[44:35.240 --> 44:35.960]  a spinning drive.
[44:37.080 --> 44:39.880]  So I think if I, you know, if I have to get a replacement, I'll probably just get us,
[44:39.880 --> 44:42.840]  get an SSD, get the largest SSD I can afford.
[44:42.840 --> 44:43.080]  Yeah.
[44:43.080 --> 44:48.840]  The way, the way Jonas's works is his C drive is a spinning hard disk, but he has a built
[44:48.840 --> 44:55.560]  in D drive that is an SSD and the games, the games are all know to store their data on
[44:55.560 --> 44:56.520]  the D drive.
[44:56.520 --> 45:01.640]  And it seems like it's both a more logical way to put the thing you care about the games
[45:01.640 --> 45:03.000]  on the SSD.
[45:03.880 --> 45:10.920]  Um, and it seems to keep your game data safe from any windows, screwage, screwy uppiness,
[45:10.920 --> 45:15.720]  you know, like you're like, you know, just, we'll just kind of go over here.
[45:15.720 --> 45:20.040]  Which you'd be over there.
[45:20.040 --> 45:21.800]  We're going to be over here doing the fun stuff.
[45:21.800 --> 45:22.120]  Right.
[45:22.680 --> 45:22.920]  Yeah.
[45:23.640 --> 45:27.960]  Which I guess for gaming game, because games so much run in their own kind of environment
[45:27.960 --> 45:29.800]  that that's, that makes sense.
[45:29.800 --> 45:30.440]  Yeah.
[45:30.440 --> 45:30.680]  Yeah.
[45:30.680 --> 45:31.240]  I think so.
[45:31.960 --> 45:32.200]  Yeah.
[45:32.200 --> 45:36.440]  That's just sort of like, just give me enough to boot to launch.
[45:36.440 --> 45:36.840]  Yeah.
[45:36.840 --> 45:41.080]  And then we'll take, it takes over the, it basically takes over the computer and the
[45:41.080 --> 45:43.080]  operating system does nothing at that point.
[45:43.080 --> 45:43.240]  Yeah.
[45:43.240 --> 45:46.280]  Yeah. So anyway, windows worse than ever.
[45:46.280 --> 45:48.920]  I just did drive, just drive me nuts.
[45:48.920 --> 45:55.080]  Like my, whatever, I don't want to call it OCD ness, but it's, you know, whatever weird
[45:55.080 --> 45:59.880]  part of my brain that lets me have my physical desk be a mess, but I know where everything
[45:59.880 --> 46:01.400]  is like, no, don't touch it.
[46:01.400 --> 46:04.040]  That's where all the important legal papers are.
[46:04.600 --> 46:11.080]  Uh, but I want my computer to be very neatly organized, including my stuff.
[46:11.080 --> 46:17.560]  But I also like the idea that the system itself is, is self-explanatory, you know, that users.
[46:18.680 --> 46:26.520]  Library preferences is your users preferences and library root level library, you know,
[46:26.520 --> 46:29.320]  preferences is stuff that's system-wide for all users.
[46:29.320 --> 46:31.080]  And it's so neat and organized.
[46:31.080 --> 46:35.160]  And there's, I just keep thinking about how, like, I think it was Adam Anks.
[46:35.160 --> 46:40.120]  Somebody recently had like an article in the last year about like, Hey, does anybody find
[46:40.120 --> 46:43.640]  the order of control panel or system preference panels in the system?
[46:43.640 --> 46:45.480]  Prefs app to be like random.
[46:46.200 --> 46:51.480]  And somebody pointed out that you can, you know, go to the view menu and cat organize
[46:51.480 --> 46:55.400]  alphabetically, you know, and you can just change system preferences on the Mac to just
[46:55.400 --> 46:57.480]  order all of them alphabetically.
[46:57.480 --> 47:02.200]  And people, people who are, can't remember where some of them are like, Oh my God, you
[47:02.200 --> 47:03.000]  just saved my life.
[47:03.000 --> 47:10.280]  Because the, the, the other order by categories is like, they don't tell you what the categories
[47:10.280 --> 47:10.520]  are.
[47:11.240 --> 47:11.880]  You know what I mean?
[47:12.520 --> 47:13.720]  Yeah, it is.
[47:13.720 --> 47:14.840]  Yeah, it's, it's something, yeah.
[47:14.840 --> 47:17.880]  Someone at Apple decided what the logical collection is right now.
[47:17.880 --> 47:18.600]  It doesn't, yeah.
[47:18.600 --> 47:18.840]  Right.
[47:18.840 --> 47:21.320]  It's difficult to say what that actually is.
[47:21.320 --> 47:24.360]  And, and it's not just a Mac OS 10.
[47:24.360 --> 47:30.520]  And I say that very specifically, like starting in 2001, 2002, you know, the original Mac
[47:30.520 --> 47:32.040]  OS 10, it's not like a carryover.
[47:32.040 --> 47:39.880]  It's like, even with iOS, with the settings app, the, the organization of the Apple ones
[47:39.880 --> 47:43.720]  before you scroll down far enough at the root level of settings to get to all your third
[47:43.720 --> 47:46.680]  party apps is sort of arbitrary.
[47:46.680 --> 47:50.040]  You know, I think it was Adam Hanks who was writing, like, I don't understand this order
[47:50.040 --> 47:50.600]  at all.
[47:50.600 --> 47:54.120]  Like, you know, why, where, why is Safari down there where it is?
[47:54.120 --> 47:56.840]  Where, why is the camera app in there with music?
[47:56.840 --> 48:02.280]  So like the camera app is down there in a section, it's the, the first group is airplane
[48:02.280 --> 48:02.920]  mode, wifi.
[48:02.920 --> 48:04.600]  It's like, okay, this is all networking stuff.
[48:05.160 --> 48:09.000]  And then there's notification sounds, do not disturb and screen time.
[48:09.000 --> 48:10.200]  I don't know why they're together.
[48:11.320 --> 48:18.680]  And general control center, display and brightness, accessibility, wallpaper, Syrian search, face
[48:18.680 --> 48:19.800]  ID and passcode.
[48:19.800 --> 48:22.920]  I, it's starting to get confusing, right?
[48:22.920 --> 48:26.200]  It's like, why, why, why, why isn't this together?
[48:26.200 --> 48:31.480]  Then there's one that's just iTunes and app store and wallet and Apple pay and they kind
[48:31.480 --> 48:32.440]  of make sense together.
[48:32.440 --> 48:35.720]  It's like, well, there's where your financials, you know, you put credit cards in those two
[48:36.760 --> 48:38.120]  and then you start getting weird.
[48:38.120 --> 48:41.000]  Then there's a bunch of apps and then it's like everything else, right?
[48:41.000 --> 48:41.400]  Yeah.
[48:41.400 --> 48:43.080]  But then there's everything else.
[48:43.080 --> 48:46.360]  But yeah, but then two sections of everything else, right?
[48:46.360 --> 48:46.840]  Yeah.
[48:46.840 --> 48:50.760]  And then the one that's really weird is that one underneath the next section where it's
[48:50.760 --> 48:57.880]  music, TV, books, podcasts, I'm going out of order game center where you're like, okay,
[48:57.880 --> 49:03.560]  this is all content stuff from Apple, but then photos is in there.
[49:03.560 --> 49:03.880]  Right.
[49:03.880 --> 49:08.440]  But then photos is in there and the camera and camera is in there.
[49:08.440 --> 49:13.160]  And that camera one is kind of important if you care about using your phone as a camera
[49:13.160 --> 49:15.400]  because it's where you set like, what's your default video?
[49:15.400 --> 49:16.440]  Do you want to shoot 4k?
[49:16.440 --> 49:17.560]  You want to shoot 10 ADP?
[49:17.560 --> 49:21.560]  Like why in the world is something so hardware related with all the, it's all a bit weird.
[49:21.560 --> 49:22.920]  You kind of remember where it is.
[49:23.640 --> 49:24.120]  Yeah.
[49:24.120 --> 49:26.600]  I mean, I figured most people use the search thing now.
[49:26.600 --> 49:27.800]  Yeah, I think so too.
[49:27.800 --> 49:31.560]  And maybe that's why they've sort of gotten away with this and it's sort of grown.
[49:31.560 --> 49:37.240]  And I think if you went back to like the original 1.0 iPhone and looked at the lot, you know,
[49:37.240 --> 49:41.080]  the layout of the settings app, you'd be like, well, this makes complete sense.
[49:41.080 --> 49:46.440]  And somehow something that started making complete sense grew into something that seems
[49:46.440 --> 49:47.640]  a bit arbitrary.
[49:48.200 --> 49:53.480]  All of those complaints, when you dig in and try to do something system preference, control
[49:53.480 --> 49:57.480]  panel, these settings, whatever you want to frigging call it on windows, you were like,
[49:57.480 --> 50:03.880]  Oh my God, thank God for the complete sanity of the Apple layout of these things.
[50:05.080 --> 50:05.580]  Yeah.
[50:06.120 --> 50:09.640]  It, it, I, I, I just, you reuse the analogy.
[50:09.640 --> 50:14.760]  I really did start to feel like Luke down in the Dagobah cave, like where it's like
[50:14.760 --> 50:16.440]  the frame rates off.
[50:16.440 --> 50:16.840]  You're right.
[50:16.840 --> 50:18.920]  Like all of a sudden it's like, is that really Darth Vader?
[50:18.920 --> 50:21.880]  Like, remember being a kid and you'd be like, what is going on?
[50:21.880 --> 50:22.600]  What is going on?
[50:22.600 --> 50:23.480]  This makes no sense.
[50:23.480 --> 50:26.040]  I really, this is like the greatest movie I've ever seen.
[50:26.040 --> 50:30.680]  And I thought I was on top of it, but Darth Vader is down here in the, all of a sudden.
[50:30.680 --> 50:31.720]  And Luke, what?
[50:32.520 --> 50:33.880]  And why isn't Yoda helping him?
[50:33.880 --> 50:36.520]  Why would Yoda let him go down there and the frame rates off?
[50:36.520 --> 50:38.440]  And yeah, it's like, what the hell happened?
[50:38.440 --> 50:41.320]  He cut his head off and what it's Luke.
[50:41.320 --> 50:44.840]  I had, you know, and why, what the hell is going on?
[50:44.840 --> 50:49.160]  That's what it feels like when you're in the XPs control panel in windows.
[50:49.160 --> 50:50.680]  It's like, where, where, where am I?
[50:50.680 --> 50:51.560]  Which is not even, yeah.
[50:51.560 --> 50:55.000]  I mean, like I think under XP, it was ugly, but it made sense.
[50:55.000 --> 50:56.440]  It made more sense anyway.
[50:56.440 --> 50:59.800]  And now it has this extra layer of like, Hey, we're being friendly.
[50:59.800 --> 51:03.560]  Um, but you've also just obfuscated so many things that I can't even understand what's
[51:03.560 --> 51:04.360]  going on anymore.
[51:06.360 --> 51:06.860]  Yeah.
[51:07.080 --> 51:07.640]  The other thing.
[51:07.640 --> 51:13.080]  So the other PC story that I have from like the last year is that Karen's dad's come to
[51:13.080 --> 51:16.840]  be, he bought a new computer when he moved in with us.
[51:16.840 --> 51:20.520]  Cause the one that he had was ancient and running windows eight.
[51:20.520 --> 51:25.480]  And, um, so he wanted me to help him migrate, um, his old stuff to his new computer.
[51:25.480 --> 51:29.880]  And they don't have as much as we complain about, um, you know, the Apple migration tool.
[51:30.760 --> 51:33.960]  There is no, with windows 10, there is no migration tool.
[51:33.960 --> 51:39.320]  There is, there is something that you can move your settings, but you can't move apps.
[51:39.880 --> 51:41.800]  It won't move your apps for you.
[51:41.800 --> 51:45.400]  And so you have to pay like 40 bucks to this company that, um, you know, they have this
[51:45.400 --> 51:47.720]  recommended tool that you use and it's like 40 bucks.
[51:47.720 --> 51:49.240]  And I was like, Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[51:49.240 --> 51:53.720]  So, so I paid the $40 to get this tool and then it moves everything, you know, and it
[51:53.720 --> 51:54.920]  worked, it worked fine.
[51:54.920 --> 51:56.600]  It worked, it worked quite well.
[51:56.600 --> 52:00.520]  But, uh, one of the things that he still had was real player.
[52:00.520 --> 52:03.720]  Oh my God.
[52:03.720 --> 52:07.480]  You know, and it moved it dutifully moved real player, which is what it, you know, what
[52:07.480 --> 52:08.760]  it thought it should do.
[52:08.760 --> 52:10.920]  But then I could not get rid of real player.
[52:10.920 --> 52:12.200]  I thought you didn't need this anymore.
[52:12.200 --> 52:15.400]  And it's, and it kept popping up trying to, you know, like every time you reboot, it would
[52:15.400 --> 52:17.400]  say real player would like to be your default.
[52:17.400 --> 52:18.280]  Like, stop it.
[52:18.280 --> 52:18.520]  Okay.
[52:18.520 --> 52:19.880]  Nobody uses real player anymore.
[52:19.880 --> 52:20.680]  You need to go away.
[52:21.400 --> 52:25.400]  And setting it as your default player for anything has got to be the worst thing you
[52:25.400 --> 52:27.320]  could possibly completely insane.
[52:27.320 --> 52:27.800]  Right.
[52:27.800 --> 52:29.240]  And I could not get rid of it.
[52:29.240 --> 52:30.680]  It's still on that machine.
[52:31.720 --> 52:34.360]  And now it's, you know, I've inherited it since he passed away.
[52:34.360 --> 52:38.680]  And so I have set it up to like, I made a Minecraft server for Hank on it, but every
[52:38.680 --> 52:44.120]  time it boots, even in my user, it still has real player popping up there saying, hi, remember
[52:44.120 --> 52:46.200]  me from 1998.
[52:50.920 --> 52:53.720]  That's the most ridiculous thing possible.
[52:54.440 --> 52:58.760]  The only thing, I mean, what else it somehow is even sillier than if it was AOL.
[52:58.760 --> 53:02.200]  I don't even know what, what could be sillier than real player.
[53:02.200 --> 53:02.680]  Yeah.
[53:02.680 --> 53:05.640]  And it's like, then there is, there are instructions for how to get rid of it.
[53:05.640 --> 53:10.200]  Like you have to, you have to like, and some, some of them involve reinstalling it and then
[53:10.200 --> 53:10.840]  deleting it.
[53:11.560 --> 53:15.160]  And I've tried all of them and it will just simply will not go away.
[53:15.160 --> 53:18.840]  There's probably a registry thing that I have to do that I haven't figured out yet,
[53:18.840 --> 53:22.200]  but maybe someday I'll get, I also just think that I'm going to end up wiping them
[53:22.200 --> 53:24.200]  whole machine and starting all over again.
[53:24.200 --> 53:25.720]  But which is not easy.
[53:25.720 --> 53:31.080]  You know, I, that's the thing about trying to create a boot disk, an external USB drive
[53:31.080 --> 53:35.960]  to boot windows was I had to, I had to use a seemingly had to use third party software.
[53:38.120 --> 53:41.320]  And I forget why there was like a free mode.
[53:41.320 --> 53:45.720]  It was a very, you know, highly recommended utility seemed like, you know, like the way
[53:45.720 --> 53:49.400]  that Mac users talk about super duper people talk about this, this thing.
[53:49.400 --> 53:50.280]  I forget what it is.
[53:50.280 --> 53:55.160]  Um, and it was like, I don't know, 15 bucks or something.
[53:56.120 --> 53:59.320]  And Jonas thought it was like a deal breaker.
[53:59.320 --> 54:03.560]  And I'm like, Jonas, we're talking about replacing.
[54:03.560 --> 54:06.840]  If this doesn't work, we're talking about spending like a thousand dollars or close
[54:06.840 --> 54:08.840]  to a thousand dollars on a video card.
[54:08.840 --> 54:11.640]  We can spend 15 bucks on software utilities.
[54:11.640 --> 54:12.760]  Like, well, that seems like a lot.
[54:12.760 --> 54:17.000]  And I'm like, and you buy $60 games every time you'd scratch $60 together.
[54:17.000 --> 54:23.400]  Yeah, but it's like, and I'm reminded, did you see the tweet from, uh, uh, cable Sasser,
[54:23.400 --> 54:28.040]  friend of the show where his son, uh, forget how young his son is, but it'll just say
[54:28.040 --> 54:29.800]  he's 10, 11 ish.
[54:29.800 --> 54:35.480]  Um, maybe, uh, was really getting into art and wanted to get procreate for iPad.
[54:35.480 --> 54:39.800]  And he's like, dad, everybody says that this is the best, but, uh, it's 10 bucks.
[54:40.840 --> 54:43.400]  Like, and knowing that this was like a deal breaker and
[54:43.400 --> 54:46.760]  Hey, it's like, you don't understand what your father does for a living.
[54:46.760 --> 54:49.480]  It's like, it was like the side, I could just imagine with cable.
[54:49.480 --> 54:54.280]  It was the sigh of all sighs, you know, we've lost, we've lost, we've, we've actually
[54:54.280 --> 54:55.080]  lost this war.
[54:55.080 --> 55:01.080]  We think we're still sort of battling to keep indie utility and productivity software
[55:01.080 --> 55:01.560]  alive.
[55:01.560 --> 55:04.120]  And it's, but it's over, it's over.
[55:04.120 --> 55:07.320]  And it's like, and I said to John, so like, you know how much this would have cost when
[55:07.320 --> 55:09.560]  I was your age, this, this utility that would match it.
[55:09.560 --> 55:10.040]  Yeah.
[55:10.040 --> 55:10.520]  Yeah.
[55:10.520 --> 55:15.960]  If it, it was like the one that this, some of the, on two reasons, some of the smartest
[55:15.960 --> 55:21.960]  people in all of the earlier of computing were involved in like recovery tools because
[55:21.960 --> 55:24.120]  a, you had to be really smart to make them work.
[55:24.120 --> 55:24.520]  Right.
[55:24.520 --> 55:27.560]  Cause you're talking about like saving people's data from drives.
[55:27.560 --> 55:30.360]  Remember, you know, drives, I've said to Joe, this too.
[55:30.360 --> 55:33.160]  I was like, you have no idea how often drives went bad.
[55:33.160 --> 55:33.720]  Oh yeah.
[55:33.720 --> 55:34.680]  It doesn't even matter.
[55:34.680 --> 55:36.760]  It wasn't even like an Apple thing versus PCs.
[55:36.760 --> 55:40.920]  Like it drives, it just go bad.
[55:44.440 --> 55:49.640]  Like even we, we in the Mac thought we were so lucky cause at least we'd get like a little
[55:49.640 --> 55:50.200]  sad Mac.
[55:53.800 --> 55:57.720]  And it's like, you know, getting back to our, you know, the droids should make noises.
[55:57.720 --> 55:57.960]  Right.
[55:58.520 --> 55:58.840]  Right.
[56:00.040 --> 56:04.680]  But it's like, you know, technically you had to be very good to read, you know, bits and
[56:04.680 --> 56:09.080]  off a drive that had gone corrupt and it's, or, you know, whatever we used to call them
[56:09.080 --> 56:11.320]  boot sectors or whatever they were, you know.
[56:12.760 --> 56:17.080]  But then also you were very smart because guess what people are willing to pay a lot
[56:17.080 --> 56:17.640]  of money for.
[56:18.360 --> 56:23.880]  They're willing to pay a lot of money to get their data back when an emergency, you
[56:23.880 --> 56:28.360]  know, has crippled them from keeping, getting access to the file they need right now.
[56:28.360 --> 56:34.760]  Um, you know, it's, it was good business and, and whatever.
[56:34.760 --> 56:36.920]  I was like, this would not be $15 back then.
[56:36.920 --> 56:39.960]  This would be like, we'd have to call the bank and authorize.
[56:39.960 --> 56:43.560]  Like replacement replacement drives were crazy expensive.
[56:43.560 --> 56:44.200]  Oh yeah.
[56:44.200 --> 56:45.000]  Crazy expensive.
[56:45.000 --> 56:45.720]  You had to buy another one.
[56:45.720 --> 56:47.000]  You were like, Oh God.
[56:47.000 --> 56:47.560]  Oh my God.
[56:48.120 --> 56:48.360]  Right.
[56:48.360 --> 56:50.760]  I was like, drives were like the video cards of the day.
[56:50.760 --> 56:57.560]  It was like, Oh, this whole thing is just a computer built around a hard disk, uh, just
[56:57.560 --> 57:00.680]  to keep me from having to, you know, use 40 floppy disks.
[57:00.680 --> 57:01.160]  Yeah.
[57:01.160 --> 57:01.320]  Yeah.
[57:01.320 --> 57:06.760]  I had it for my first computer was an SC with a high density, not the 30, but with the high
[57:06.760 --> 57:08.360]  density floppy drives.
[57:08.360 --> 57:14.600]  Um, it did two floppy drives and instead of an internal drive and one floppy drive, and
[57:14.600 --> 57:19.320]  then it had an external hard drive, which was great because the guy, I bought it from
[57:19.320 --> 57:22.600]  a guy because I was going to graduate school and the guy said like, I feel, I feel like
[57:22.600 --> 57:26.760]  this is a good setup because you can like, if the drive goes down, you can run the OS
[57:26.760 --> 57:29.800]  on one of these floppies and then you can have another floppy in there with your data
[57:29.800 --> 57:31.000]  and programs and stuff like that.
[57:31.000 --> 57:32.760]  I was like, yeah, that sounds like a great idea.
[57:32.760 --> 57:37.000]  And it never, it never happened, but, um, but it was still, it was a great, I thought,
[57:37.000 --> 57:38.280]  always thought that was a great setup.
[57:39.000 --> 57:44.040]  Uh, whatever, whatever we did to get this bootable USB drive of windows took forever,
[57:44.040 --> 57:46.200]  took a lot longer than you'd think it would.
[57:46.200 --> 57:50.680]  And I was like, but I was like, and Jonas was getting a bit impatient and I was like,
[57:50.680 --> 57:56.200]  well, you know, I, I, I realized this is taking longer than I think it should, but I
[57:56.200 --> 57:59.800]  remember, and you know, let me tell you about what it was like in the old days.
[57:59.800 --> 58:05.800]  I remember the first time I had a job where we got windows NT and it came on floppies
[58:05.800 --> 58:07.720]  and it was like 40 floppies.
[58:07.720 --> 58:08.040]  Yeah.
[58:08.040 --> 58:08.520]  Yeah.
[58:08.520 --> 58:09.400]  And he's like, come on.
[58:09.400 --> 58:11.320]  I'm like, Nope, 40 floppies.
[58:11.320 --> 58:16.440]  And you would put it in and you know, I guess in theory, somebody could have built a robot
[58:16.440 --> 58:21.080]  to do it, but instead what they would do is hire college kids and your job.
[58:21.960 --> 58:24.440]  And I was like, so I got paid for like an entire day of work.
[58:24.440 --> 58:30.600]  I showed up at nine and today was the day I would install a NT on this PC and I would
[58:30.600 --> 58:32.520]  just sit there and wait and wait.
[58:32.520 --> 58:36.440]  And then the floppy, it would tell me and I hit a button and the floppy would pick out
[58:36.440 --> 58:37.800]  and I'd put number two in there.
[58:38.680 --> 58:43.640]  It would take a couple seconds for it to figure it out, get its bearings and then in the floppy
[58:43.640 --> 58:46.360]  drive, then it would continue and this would go on.
[58:46.360 --> 58:48.200]  And by the end of the day, maybe I was done.
[58:48.200 --> 58:54.120]  Uh, you know, times change.
[58:54.120 --> 58:54.840]  Yeah.
[58:56.440 --> 58:56.680]  All right.
[58:56.680 --> 58:59.880]  Let me tell you, speaking of which, what a, this is actually, I swear to God, I didn't
[58:59.880 --> 59:00.840]  set this up.
[59:00.840 --> 59:01.960]  Didn't set it up.
[59:01.960 --> 59:06.120]  This is a true coincidence, but my God, our next sponsor Backblaze.
[59:06.120 --> 59:08.520]  What a great, what a, what a great segue.
[59:08.520 --> 59:13.800]  Backblaze is unlimited computer backup for Macs and PCs with none of the hassles I just
[59:13.800 --> 59:18.680]  talked about in the old days, six bucks a month, which is unbelievable.
[59:18.680 --> 59:19.960]  Also not expensive.
[59:19.960 --> 59:24.680]  Like in the old days, six bucks a month, you back up everything, your documents, your music,
[59:24.680 --> 59:28.840]  your photos, your videos, your drawings, your projects, all of your data, and you can restore
[59:28.840 --> 59:30.440]  your files anywhere.
[59:30.440 --> 59:34.600]  You can get them direct download from the web or case of catastrophe.
[59:35.160 --> 59:38.520]  Something happens, somebody steals your, your hard drive, steals your computer.
[59:39.080 --> 59:42.760]  Uh, the roof caves in, uh, you're just traveling.
[59:42.760 --> 59:45.320]  You're out, you're away from home, but you need to access them.
[59:45.320 --> 59:48.280]  If you need to, you can get the whole drive sent to you.
[59:48.280 --> 59:52.360]  Um, like FedEx, they'll just put it on a, on a USB drive, send it to you.
[59:53.000 --> 59:56.040]  Uh, really, you can just restore your computer by mail.
[59:56.040 --> 59:57.080]  That's just unbelievable.
[59:57.080 --> 01:00:01.080]  They'll overnight FedEx it to you and you can restore and return the hard drive to us
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:05.240]  when you're done, to them when you're done and get the money back for the drive.
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:08.280]  So they'll just send you a hard drive with all your stuff overnight.
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.280]  Get it the next morning, copy it back.
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.320]  You're restored.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.440]  Send the drive back to them.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.040]  You get the cost of the drive back.
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.720]  That's, that's just unbelievable.
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:19.160]  You need to just get like one file somewhere, use their iOS app.
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.560]  You can just go right in to your last backup.
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:25.080]  There's a list of everything backed up from your Mac or your PC.
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.120]  Find the file you want.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:30.120]  There it is right on your iPhone, your iPad, whatever, wherever you are.
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.080]  Um, really just great mobile apps.
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:38.600]  Uh, they have restored over 50 billion files for its customers fully featured.
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:43.160]  And when it runs on your Mac, uh, it, you install back blaze, you sign up, you sign
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:46.120]  in and it just runs silently in the background.
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:47.320]  You don't even know it's there.
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:48.760]  There's never any kind of interruption.
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.560]  You don't have to do anything, but you need to see what's going on.
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:55.160]  When the last time it was, you just go into system preferences, go to back blaze.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:55.880]  There it is.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.560]  Anything you want to see in it.
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:01.080]  Very easy, nice interface while you're just using your computer.
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.840]  You don't have to worry about it, but there you go.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:08.040]  You have a full backup of all your stuff offsite, out of your house, out of your office,
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.080]  wherever you are.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:09.400]  Really.
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.880]  I've been using it for years and years.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.160]  Uh, never a problem.
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:14.520]  I recommend it to everybody.
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:15.720]  It's really great.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:22.040]  They have a fully featured trial with no credit card required upfront at back blaze.com

[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:43.320]  Yeah.
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:47.080]  Backing up, backing up back then was like impossible.
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.120]  I don't remember what I did.
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.200]  I think it just backed things up on floppies.
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.560]  Like you would back up files that you needed to keep and that was about it.
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:53.880]  Yeah.
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:55.240]  I still have all those floppies.
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:00.360]  I guess if I, I think mine are all right behind me right now.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:03.160]  I always say, uh, you know, some people get into golf.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:08.440]  It's like, I guess my retirement plan is I'll get into retro retro computing and hope that
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.600]  my floppies still work, I guess.
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:16.520]  Uh, yeah, but anything truly important, like if I had a game that was really good, I would
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:21.000]  just put it on floppy and lay by and I was real, you know, uh, I don't know if you did
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:21.160]  this.
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:25.720]  I, I, uh, I would, I had a style writer.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:26.920]  Remember the style writer?
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:27.160]  Yeah.
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:27.560]  Oh yeah.
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:36.360]  An inkjet, uh, and I, I bought labels like floppy disc labels and uh, what's that?
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:40.760]  That one company that has like a weird monopoly on, on labels.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:43.000]  Oh yeah.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:43.960]  I can't think of the name.
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.920]  Well, whatever they are.
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:48.920]  I bought their floppy disc labels and I would, if I had a game I really liked, I would, I
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:50.520]  would make a custom icon.
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:54.840]  You know, I did, I'd go into rez edit, get the icon if the style writer was black and
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:59.960]  white, so I'd get the, uh, even though I had a color LC, I'd go into rez edit and get the
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:01.640]  black and white icon, right?
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:04.920]  Because they, they, all the games still had to have black and white icons to some of the
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:05.160]  Macs.
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.760]  If you were running it on an se or something.
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:07.080]  Yeah.
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:07.240]  Right.
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:12.520]  And I would make custom labels for the games and make like these, you know, as nice as
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:17.080]  I could make them labels and then have an archive of all my stuff that I had just downloaded
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:17.640]  from the internet.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.000]  That was my backup.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:19.320]  Nice.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:20.920]  What else did I have?
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.560]  I had a, I had a tape drive at some point.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.240]  Uh, Oh, really?
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:25.560]  Wow.
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:25.880]  Yeah.
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:29.000]  We ended up at work, but I never, I never had one at home.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.680]  Um, I was like, the zip drive was like the first thing that I had.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:36.520]  Uh, I bought a tape drive and what was the name of the program?
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:41.000]  It was like the official, like the best backup program for like professional.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.920]  Cause this was like after college and I was, I had, you know, I was doing most of my income
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:45.960]  was from freelance work.
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:48.840]  So I felt like I should be professional and get a backup thing.
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:53.480]  So I had a expensive backup drive and I had these tapes that were expensive and it was
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.040]  backing it up.
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:57.480]  Uh, I think it's a typical Murphy's law.
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:03.080]  I never once needed them and never, never once backed up or restored a single thing.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:09.080]  I spent like, to my mind, a fortune that could have been better spent on fun stuff on a backup
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:12.040]  system that I never once ever used ever.
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.280]  Not even like one time, one file.
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.840]  Oh my God, whatever happened to that one file?
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:18.120]  I could bet I could get it from a tape.
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:18.440]  Nope.
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:19.240]  Never used it.
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.640]  I have no idea if any of them ever worked ever.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:22.920]  Cause you couldn't boot from them.
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.920]  That was the thing that wasn't a bootable thing.
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:28.680]  You'd have to like get the tape and restore it to our, it just seemed like so hard to
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:29.080]  test.
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:34.840]  So I never tested it, which of course is pretty dumb that I spent a relative fortune of my
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.520]  personal net worth on a backup system.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.440]  It was like having a painting of your backup.
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:48.440]  Uh, anyway, that was a cheap, but that would, tape was the cheap way to do, to do backups.
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:48.920]  Right.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:53.720]  To do backups. Right. Cause you could, you could back up a lot of data on tape for relatively,
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.720]  like it was, it was an inexpensive medium.
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:56.680]  Right.
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:02.840]  If so, you could have large amounts of data and, and you know, it was non ran, no random
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:03.160]  acts.
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:04.360]  Yeah.
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:05.080]  Yeah.
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:05.480]  Right.
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:06.200]  And yeah, that's right.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.800]  Cause you had to back up the whole thing.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.360]  Right.
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:11.960]  And you store it, we had to restore the whole thing in order to get like one file.
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:12.280]  Right.
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:15.800]  Because unlike a hard drive, if you wanted to get, you know, one file that was at the
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:20.760]  beginning of the tape and the other at the end of the tape, it would take you 20 minutes.
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:23.160]  Anyway.
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:25.240]  Oh, good times.
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:27.320]  Yeah.
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.080]  Most of that stuff is right here at my feet.
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.520]  Cause I podcast from the basement.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:35.880]  And so, and speaking of like things that you had to plug in different cards in the back,
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:41.320]  my performance 6400 is right here with the, I got it and I got an extra card, like the
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.080]  video, the advanced video card for it.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:48.360]  I forget what the heck the company was that made it, but like it was, um, a card that
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:52.840]  you put into the thing and then you had to get into the cable to, to reroute the video
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.280]  through the card back.
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.360]  So, you know,
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:02.280]  all right, moving on, uh, I just, I figured the rest of the show, we'd just talk a little
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:06.200]  lighthearted stuff, maybe make some movie TV recommendations, but, uh, the one thing
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:11.240]  related to that is, um, there was a rumor a couple of weeks ago, Mark Gurman had that
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:16.520]  Apple's supposedly thinking about coming out with a bundle of their subscription content
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:19.480]  stuff, which has, yeah, it seems pretty obvious.
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:23.880]  Ever since they started offering more than one monthly subscription thing, people have
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:28.840]  wondered, why don't they have a bundle where you can, you know, get them together, uh,
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:33.720]  with the idea that it's named Apple one, or at least that's the working title, uh,
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:34.680]  according to Gurman.
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.800]  And I wrote about this during fireball.
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:43.560]  I suggested that maybe they should try to, you know, it, what Gurman described seemed
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.240]  way too complicated to me.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.840]  It just seemed like it's not much of a bundle, right?
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:54.360]  Like it just seemed like, you know, there'd be like one tier with music and TV, and then
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:58.840]  you can pay more and get news and pay more and get this and pay.
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:04.680]  And it's like, and then like ultimately it was like, so a family with family sharing
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:11.320]  could wind up saving $5 on what would otherwise cost $45 a month to get like all of it, music
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:18.360]  and TV with sharing, with news, with Apple arcade and extended more than the default
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:19.400]  iCloud storage.
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:25.080]  And to me, my take was, well, I don't know, you know, and I feel like pricing and names
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:29.000]  are the sort of things that are the last to leak because they can be known by the least
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:29.960]  number of people.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:33.000]  You know, they can keep that within, I was going to say Schiller's group, but maybe
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.920]  it's JAWS's group at this point.
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:41.640]  Yeah, but I suggested that they should really try to be aggressive on the pricing on this
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:48.280]  and maybe, you know, try to get it to like 20 bucks for a single or 15 bucks for, you
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:52.600]  know, like a person and 20 bucks for family sharing with the idea that maybe they have
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:57.080]  to, right now it's 10 bucks for Apple music as an individual and 15 bucks a month for
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:58.760]  Apple music for a family.
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:03.800]  And because Apple doesn't own all that music or any of that music, they have to license
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:04.280]  it.
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:08.840]  It's not really up to Apple that they can't just, unlike Apple arcade, where they can
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:11.320]  say, look, Apple arcade, it's five bucks a month.
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.880]  And if you have a family, everybody in your family can use it.
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.280]  And there's no upsell for family sharing.
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:19.240]  They can do that because they own the rights to all the Apple arcade games.
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:20.440]  They can't do that for music.
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:24.200]  So let's just assume family sharing has to cost five bucks more.
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:29.320]  Why not 15 and $20 and get more people on it?
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:33.000]  And a lot of people wrote to me, I'm like, wait, aren't you the one who's always saying
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.680]  that Apple charges a fortune for everything and this year's me and you, we always have
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:40.280]  our segment when you're on the talk show that spend Tim Cook's money, right?
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:48.360]  Yeah, I feel, yeah, well, I would love it if they, I don't think they'll do it just
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:52.280]  because of, because of that, because they, they tend to charge more for everything.
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:52.440]  Right.
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:55.160]  And this seems this, yeah, I mean, like you said, this is aggressive.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.520]  I think it would be wonderful if they were aggressive.
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:02.760]  I mean, cause I'm currently paying, well, I'm not paying for TV plus yet because I'm
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:05.320]  still on the free year, but I probably will.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:08.200]  Cause I think there's enough stuff on it that I really, really like.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:15.000]  Maybe we'll get to some of that a little later, but I got to pay for the music.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.440]  We're all, we're all using music.
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.320]  I'm paying for arcade.
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:21.560]  Hank is actually not playing arcade very much.
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.320]  Um, if at all, frankly.
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:27.320]  Um, but I do occasionally and I like seeing what's available.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:31.160]  So, and that's the one I keep thinking, well, am I going to get rid of that or not?
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:36.600]  But if it was a part of a bundle, I would probably totally pay for the whole thing.
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:41.560]  And five bucks a month is, I'm getting old here, 60 bucks a year.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:48.600]  I had to double check that it's not, you know, it's not nothing, but I feel like $5 a
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.880]  month for new games is roughly what I would waste any.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:52.920]  And I don't play a lot of games.
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:56.600]  Even at me as someone that doesn't play a lot of games, I would, you know, still find
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:01.000]  a new game and oh, it's $3 or $2 I'll buy it.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:04.040]  Um, I'm on that for $5 a month.
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:08.120]  I'm, I'm interested enough, even though I don't spend a lot of time on Apple arcade
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.400]  games, I like seeing it.
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.280]  It seems fair.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:16.360]  Um, my argument in favor of this, even knowing that Apple stuff tends to be expensive and
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:20.200]  they don't discount it is that services are very different, right?
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:25.880]  There's no or, or less marginal costs for increasing it, right?
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:31.160]  Like when more people sign up for Apple arcade, Apple doesn't incur any extra costs other
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:36.120]  than the download cost of the games to more people, which is negligible.
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:36.520]  Come on.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:44.360]  Um, as opposed to people who might think like, Oh my God, the new iPhone 12 is going to
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:45.800]  start at $1,100.
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:49.800]  I wish they would only charge $800 and just, you know, it's like, well that, you know,
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:50.680]  welcome to Apple.
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.080]  You know, they're, they're going to charge more.
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:11:01.080]  Um, my argument in a totally, let's just try to make Apple the most money possible.
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:08.520]  Cynical purse perspective is a lower priced bundle that seems like, well, Oh man, at that
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:15.880]  price I should just sign up, would get so many more people to pay 15 or 20 bucks a month
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:17.160]  to Apple monthly.
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:21.000]  So many more people who don't spend anything monthly to Apple.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:26.680]  Um, or even if they only have music, which I think for obvious reasons, probably their
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:32.280]  most popular thing just to get them to spend five bucks more than they're already spending
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:37.480]  for Apple music and just give them everything except, and again, the news, they can't just
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:39.480]  throw in free cause news they don't own.
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:43.800]  They have to pay all the, the publishers who are in news plus.
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:50.760]  And also it also seems like the least popular thing because it's also the one aspect of
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.200]  this that is not fun at all.
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:53.420]  Right.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.320]  Certainly right now.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:55.820]  Right.
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:01.240]  It's like, who would like to relax?
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:04.360]  What's who wants to pay $5 for this news?
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:05.960]  No good.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:06.680]  Thanks.
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:08.840]  Oh, I don't want to see anything about that story.
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:10.040]  What else is in the news?
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:22.120]  Oh, Oh, the, Oh, the least the good news is a hurricane that wasn't as bad as they thought
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:27.160]  it was going to be, but was still bad and caused a lot of that.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.440]  That's the good news.
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:28.760]  Okay.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:29.400]  Yeah.
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:29.720]  Yeah.
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.720]  I'm going to say, I'm going to go back to arcade.
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.200]  Maybe we'll go back to staring at the wall.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.000]  Yeah.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.160]  It's the new episode of Ted lasso out.
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:39.320]  Yeah.
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:42.040]  How much, how much do I have to pay to just stare at the wall?
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:42.540]  Right.
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:48.600]  Um, but again, they can't just throw it in free, you know, from Apple's Pacific cause
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:49.560]  they have to pay them.
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:53.640]  And it seems like that's also something that's not as appealing to everybody.
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:57.080]  And then the storage thing, Oh my God.
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:05.320]  How many years now have we been talking that, Hey, the storage for Apple or for iCloud is
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:06.760]  kind of expensive.
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:13.160]  The default free one is ridiculously small and doesn't help anybody back up anything.
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.200]  Um, when is this going?
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.640]  This has to change eventually.
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:17.880]  Right?
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:22.440]  Like we're not going to be here 20 years from now doing episode a thousand of the talk show
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:28.680]  talking about the same five gigabyte plan for iCloud, right?
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:33.880]  It has to change eventually says me, the guy who's
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:36.360]  50, right? It's 50 or 50, whatever.
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:36.760]  Yeah.
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:37.000]  Okay.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.520]  I was wanting to make, cause like I originally, I think maybe it was like five or something.
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:41.720]  It was five for a while.
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:42.120]  Right.
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:42.680]  Yeah.
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.680]  Um, and you know, it's funny.
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:48.920]  I, a couple of people wrote to me when I wrote about this and other people, I'm not close.
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:50.360]  Oh, wait, hang on a second.
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.280]  50 is the 50 is a dollar a month.
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:53.080]  Yeah.
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:53.560]  Yeah.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.000]  You still have to pay to get to 50.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.640]  I think the default, the free one is still like 10 gigabytes.
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.160]  I think maybe it sounds right.
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:13:59.640]  Yeah.
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:01.160]  But it's not, it's not enough.
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:05.960]  I don't know, but, or if they want to say, okay, for free, we're still going to be mean
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:08.120]  and we're not going to give you enough, but just make it.
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:13.080]  So if you pay anything, you have enough to back up your device and typical photo albums
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:17.640]  like the, the dollar 99 plan really isn't enough for people who are shooting video.
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:23.400]  And it just doesn't make sense that they're shipping these devices with truly amazing
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:27.640]  4k cameras, like kind of crazy, you know, like again, I still look at it.
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:31.480]  I never look at things that I'm on cause I can't stand looking or listening to myself,
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:37.240]  but I still look at my talk show remote and think that we shot that with iPhones.
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:38.200]  I can't believe it.
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:39.560]  It looks so good.
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.280]  It's five gigabytes is free.
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:43.000]  Five gigabytes.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.760]  So I guess what you said originally was correct.
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:48.280]  I talked myself out of it, because it just seems like, oh, that can't be true.
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:52.040]  That seems so ridiculous that I couldn't believe that was real.
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:58.360]  So maybe my, my hope, and again, I'm, I'm truly Charlie Brown kicking Lucy's football
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:03.800]  with iCloud storage plans, but my hope is that they've been holding onto these old
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.800]  ones as long as they have.
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:12.040]  So that when they unveil this bundle, they can, they can say, and you're going from
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.520]  this terrible plan that we don't even know.
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:18.600]  We don't even know what maniacs, uh, all of us have been here forever.
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:20.360]  Yeah.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.080]  Who did this?
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:22.360]  Who did this?
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:26.440]  Now you can pay this one low monthly fee and you get on a four still.
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:26.920]  Yeah.
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:27.240]  Yeah.
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:27.480]  Yeah.
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:28.920]  Get him up there.
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:35.160]  But anyway, but the other day on the flip side, I just sort of unrelated to my argument
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:38.280]  that the bundle should be relatively low priced and compelling.
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:42.040]  The two, the most you can give them is like, I forget what it costs per month.
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:45.000]  What's the 50 gig or two terabyte plan?
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:51.000]  Uh, uh, 10 bucks a month, which isn't much per month, but that's the most you can
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:51.400]  get.
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:55.480]  And it's, I, I've heard from a bunch of daring fireball readers who were either pressing
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:16:02.600]  up against it or are over it and now have to manage what do they do with their videos?
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:07.080]  You know, and if you, you know, I, I can't even imagine what we'd be at if all of my
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:14.600]  video from my now 16 year old son, if I had four cave footage of him when he was a baby,
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:18.280]  my God, we'd be over two terabytes easily.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:18.520]  Yeah.
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:24.040]  So, and that, and just sort of ballpark estimating the age of the people emailing me, it's
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:27.000]  people with younger kids, they have more home video footage.
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.480]  Um, and why not shoot 4k?
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:29.720]  Right.
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:34.840]  I mean, you want the, you know, don't be an idiot and shoot 10 80 to save space.
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.720]  You know, you have these memories of your precious family.
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:38.840]  You love your child.
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:39.400]  Yeah.
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:41.960]  Don't you realize how big TVs are going to be in 40 years?
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:42.840]  Right.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:50.200]  Um, so I don't know, I, but anyway, that's my, my basic idea is that at a fundamental
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.480]  level, even if Apple wants to be, you know, why are Apple's prices so high?
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:56.840]  Why do they have 38% profit margins across the company?
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.640]  Because they enjoy making money there.
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:04.360]  That's, you know, part of what they do is they are, you know, how do they sleep at night?
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:08.360]  There's a line from madman, you know, somebody asks Don Draper, how do you sleep at night?
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:15.720]  And he says on a bed of money, uh, even if they're in it for the money, they want to
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:19.320]  make the most money they can on their own branded services.
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:24.440]  I think they would make more money by having a compelling bundle.
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:29.640]  That's a lot lower than the price of the a la carte.
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:29.960]  Okay.
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:34.120]  I'll get music and TV plus and arcade.
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:41.000]  Um, and I guess I need more storage because I have to back up more than five gigabytes
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:41.640]  of stuff.
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:45.640]  Uh, why not make it like a dislike?
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:46.600]  No brainer.
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:46.920]  Okay.
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:50.920]  You were spending close to $40 a month for 20 bucks a month.
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:55.640]  You can get this, but then yes, you'll make less money from people like me who were spending
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.560]  40 bucks a month or something like that.
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:02.440]  But you'll make up so much more from all the people who were only spending 10 bucks a month
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:09.000]  on music and you know, yeah, the math has to work out that there's some sweet spot in
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.160]  there.
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:14.520]  Maybe my dream prices are too low, but something where it's way less than the, than, than the
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:18.920]  a la carte combination five, like the Garmin story that says you might save five bucks
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:22.200]  a month if you buy everything is like, what's the point?
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.480]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:26.360]  What do you think?
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:26.760]  I know.
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:30.680]  Well, it seems to me like, yeah, there's, well, obviously there's a spreadsheet someplace
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:32.920]  in Cupertino that has all of this on it, right?
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:37.640]  And my guess is that they figure out where that sweet spot is and then they add $5.
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:40.360]  I guess.
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:42.040]  I don't know.
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:43.400]  I really hope it's true.
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:47.880]  Anyway, last thing on the show, I just wanted to throw out some recommendations for people
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:50.520]  for maybe this holiday week and what to watch.
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:53.480]  I want to recommend Ted Lasso, which is an Apple.
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:54.520]  Have you been watching?
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:55.240]  Oh my God.
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:57.640]  I've seen it like three times all the way through.
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:18:59.560]  It's so good.
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:01.480]  And it's so good.
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:03.880]  And it's not what I expected at all.
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:08.520]  I thought it was going to be, and I think maybe they played that up in the previews.
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:15.240]  I thought it's, you know, the premise is this guy was a American football coach in Kansas
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:16.520]  or Missouri.
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:22.840]  I forget where he's from, who somehow gets hired as the head of a premier league soccer
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:23.720]  team in London.
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:25.880]  Fish out of water.
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:32.200]  I figured the guy, it was going to be like, uh, you know, like 30 rock, uh, slapstick,
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:38.440]  truly dumb guy comedy, you know, like Ernest goes to coach soccer level of comedy.
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:39.720]  I like Jason Sudeikis.
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:40.600]  I thought it would be like that.
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:42.200]  It's not like that at all.
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.000]  It is funny.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.120]  I enjoy it, but it is way less.
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.120]  He's not a dumb guy.
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:50.280]  He's, he's really quite smart.
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:51.240]  He's quite smart.
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:54.040]  And as one of the most, he's like, he's sort of like Yoda, right?
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.600]  I mean, yeah, he's wise.
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:58.760]  He's not smart about soccer at all.
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:02.040]  It, he forgets, he forgets that they have ties.
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:05.640]  He forgets all these things, but he's smart about people.
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:06.140]  Right.
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:09.960]  And it's an earnest show in a way.
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:11.560]  It's not cynical.
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:17.640]  It is, uh, it is a throwback, uh, on Twitter.
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:21.400]  I was talking about how much, uh, a little thread and friend of the show, Adam, Lisa
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:24.760]  Gore, just, I think he described it as I, he just likes it.
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:27.400]  Cause it, everybody in the show is nice to each other.
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:28.760]  Uh, and that's not quite true.
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:30.120]  There's, you know, yeah, no.
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:30.360]  Yeah.
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:32.840]  But there's a heart of the heart of the show is nice.
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:36.760]  And in people who are nice to each other, really, you know, are the ones that you
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:40.040]  associate with and root for.
[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:41.160]  I love it.
[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:42.440]  Amy loves it.
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:47.000]  I've, I have watched, there's an episode that, uh, like the second to last episode,
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.320]  Amy fell asleep very early and I couldn't stop.
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:52.040]  And I'm usually, I'm very good about like stopping anything.
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:52.840]  And I was so into it.
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:55.640]  I watched the whole thing and then we just watched it again last night.
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:57.640]  And I've just, I've watched an episode.
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:01.320]  I haven't watched an episode of a show that I've watched before in years.
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:04.120]  I mean, literally since Mad Men, I loved it again.
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:04.680]  It was great.
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:08.920]  It was the one that the episode where they had the charity thing for underprivileged
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:09.420]  children.
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:12.120]  Um, and it was a nice surprise.
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:14.280]  Amy was like, wait, was this the one I fell asleep in?
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:14.760]  I was like, yeah.
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:15.880]  And she was like, so we have another one.
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:16.440]  And I was like, yeah.
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:17.400]  And she was like, yay.
[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:20.600]  And it was like the happiest thing that's happened to us in a month.
[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:22.360]  The next one's even better.
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:26.120]  I, well, we watched it last night, but she didn't know.
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:29.720]  She thought we were catching up and I was like, no, we have 30 more minutes.
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:31.480]  And it's, it was great.
[01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:36.760]  And it's such a great cast is like, it's a classic sitcom, you know, like cheers
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:40.600]  where there's like, you know, I don't know, a dozen characters and you like them
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:45.240]  all and they're all even the ones who aren't in a lot are like, ah, I like them.
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:46.280]  Yeah.
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:48.920]  And some of them were working on the writing, at least.
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:52.440]  I know the guy who plays Roy Kent, uh, wrote one of the more recent episodes.
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:52.760]  Oh yeah.
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:53.240]  Really?
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:53.560]  Huh?
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:54.040]  Yeah.
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:54.540]  Yeah.
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:56.520]  I was looking it up online.
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:22:01.400]  Um, I, I really enjoy that show and I would just say, just forget about the
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:01.880]  trailer.
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:02.840]  Just go watch it.
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:04.120]  If you have Apple TV plus.
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:04.920]  Yeah.
[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:08.440]  Cause I, cause I went back, I don't even remember seeing the trailer per se, but
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:12.200]  I went when they announced that I went back and looked at some of them because
[01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:16.040]  he, it started out as an ad for NBC's coverage of
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:16.680]  Yeah.
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:17.180]  Yeah.
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:20.440]  Football, like British football, right.
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:25.240]  Um, about this, you know, like goofy American and it was much more, I mean,
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:27.000]  not slapstick, but much more silly.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.920]  And, and, you know, he was much more of a Homer Simpson type, I guess.
[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:31.640]  Yeah.
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:32.120]  Yeah.
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.160]  That's a good way to put it.
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:33.400]  Yeah.
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.400]  Like Homer Simpson caught you coaching a sport.
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:36.840]  He doesn't know the rules too.
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:37.080]  Yeah.
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:37.720]  Yeah.
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:38.220]  Yeah.
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:43.240]  Um, and the premise is just so, the basic premise is so ridiculous.
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:47.080]  Um, it's, you know, like, imagine if like, it's like saying, like, imagine
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:52.520]  if the United States put a reality show game show host narcissists, sociopath
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:56.760]  and elected him president of the United States, you know, a guy who doesn't
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:59.720]  know soccer coaching in the premier league in England, it doesn't be, you
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:00.520]  know, couldn't happen.
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:05.480]  Um, but anyway, I really recommend it.
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:09.960]  And again, I am a cold, you know, me, John and I'm cold hearted.
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:11.560]  I like, I like my comedy.
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:14.680]  Mean, I like, I like my cynicism.
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:19.080]  This show is like a feel good show and I love it.
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:20.040]  I even, I need it.
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:20.920]  I need this show.
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:25.640]  And I know it wasn't planned for when it came out, but it is, it is truly
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:26.440]  the perfect.
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:27.880]  It's the, it's perfect for right now.
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:33.240]  It's exactly, yeah, it is just, it's so, uh, so it really decompresses
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:34.360]  you watching the show.
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:35.080]  Yeah.
[01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:38.360]  It is the proverbial cold glass of ice water in hell.
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:38.860]  Yeah.
[01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:43.100]  So Ted Lasso is my recommendation and it's been renewed for another season.
[01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:44.860]  Oh, that's fantastic.
[01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:45.340]  Yeah.
[01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:50.220]  I feel like, I feel like this could be the sort of show that really, I'm not
[01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:53.100]  going to say it's going to single handedly turn Apple TV plus into a hit,
[01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:56.380]  but it seems like the type of show that's going to have word of mouth.
[01:23:56.380 --> 01:23:57.420]  Like people will say it.
[01:23:57.420 --> 01:23:57.980]  Oh yeah.
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:24:01.660]  I noticed that I felt for a while I was watching, I got on it early and I
[01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:03.980]  felt like I was talking about it and nobody else was.
[01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:06.540]  And then all of a sudden, like this, this floodgate, well, not all of a
[01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:10.460]  sudden, slowly this floodgate started opening and, um, I keep seeing more and
[01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:11.580]  more people talking about it.
[01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:15.980]  And everybody who talks about it is just like, wow, this is so good.
[01:24:15.980 --> 01:24:17.340]  And I wasn't expecting it.
[01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:17.740]  Yeah.
[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:22.220]  And, and you know, and there is something to be said for the sitcom format.
[01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:25.660]  30 minutes, here's a story, but it's modern.
[01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:30.460]  It's not a, it's a throwback sentimentality wise in a way that people are
[01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:31.580]  good to each other.
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:37.580]  But like it, unlike a classic sitcom, which was always meant purposefully
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:41.740]  so that the episodes can be seen in any order, written for syndication,
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:45.420]  you know, so that, you know, like when you watch cheers, you don't have to
[01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:49.260]  know, you don't have to watch season six episodes immediately.
[01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:52.460]  If you didn't watch episode three, you're never going to get episode four.
[01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:54.700]  No, they're all, they all stand alone.
[01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:56.300]  This one, they go in order.
[01:24:56.300 --> 01:25:00.220]  You have to watch the season in order, which is a very modern streaming way of
[01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:01.900]  writing a season.
[01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:03.420]  It's so easy to get into.
[01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:05.980]  Oh, I totally recommend it to anybody.
[01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:08.540]  Anything else you want to recommend?
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:13.740]  No, I would just say one more thing about it.
[01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:17.340]  It's, it's definitely my favorite, just to talk about more Apple TV Plus,
[01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:20.380]  but it's definitely my favorite Apple TV Plus series.
[01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:22.300]  And there's, there are a couple that I really like.
[01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:26.300]  I really liked Dickerson and I really have liked the Space one.
[01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:28.940]  For All Mankind.
[01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:30.220]  I liked For All Mankind.
[01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:32.700]  Could not get Amy involved in it at all.
[01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:33.420]  I enjoyed it.
[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:34.940]  Glad they got season two coming out.
[01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:39.180]  We enjoyed as a family, the M Night Shyamalan one, which
[01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:39.740]  Oh, did you?
[01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:40.060]  Okay.
[01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:40.860]  What's it called?
[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:42.140]  I'm not a big horror fan.
[01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:46.780]  So that one was, uh, it seemed like it was well made, but it wasn't my cup of tea
[01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:47.260]  particularly.
[01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:48.860]  I only, I didn't get through the first episode.
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:53.180]  It's actually filmed blocks away from our house.
[01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:54.700]  Servant.
[01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:55.820]  It's called Servant.
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:56.300]  That's right.
[01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:58.620]  I wanted to say beloved and I knew that was not it.
[01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:03.820]  It, it's, it is very M Night Shyamalan.
[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:05.100]  Uh, right.
[01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:07.420]  It's a little lower on the horror.
[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:10.220]  You know, it's, it's very, it's suspenseful though.
[01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:11.260]  And it's weird.
[01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:11.580]  Yeah.
[01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:13.500]  Did you watch or no?
[01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:14.220]  I watched some of it.
[01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:16.860]  I watched some of the first episode and then I was like, yeah, I'm not going to,
[01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:18.380]  this isn't, and it's not an idea.
[01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:20.940]  It's not because I think it's bad or it's poorly made or anything.
[01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:25.100]  It's just, it's a, I do not care for horror very much.
[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:27.980]  Um, so, um, and the other thing it was.
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:31.500]  So the other thing I've heard very good things about is Lovecraft country.
[01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:34.940]  But another thing that is horror that I probably will.
[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:36.380]  Yeah.
[01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:37.660]  I think that's next on our list.
[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:38.940]  That's HBO max.
[01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:39.820]  Yeah.
[01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:40.780]  Yeah.
[01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:42.060]  That would be next on our list.
[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:43.500]  We're going to watch that.
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:45.980]  Um, anyway, that's pretty good.
[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:52.620]  I heard there's a rumor that Apple might extend the TV plus thing for another year with purchases.
[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:59.900]  Um, I, you know, I can see why and I feel like it's sort of, how do you bootstrap a,
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:01.660]  cause they're not doing that.
[01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:04.300]  They didn't buy the library rights to anything, right?
[01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:09.020]  Like when you get, and this is like before, like a year ago before TV plus launched,
[01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:13.420]  everybody was like, well, why are people going to pay for a service that only has,
[01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:19.340]  even if the six shows are great, why would you pay five bucks a month for a service with six shows
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:21.100]  that when you watch them, you're out?
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:25.660]  And the answer was, well, they're really kind of going to go out of their way to give it to
[01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:29.180]  anybody who buys any other Apple hardware products.
[01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:32.140]  Um, and that's how you bootstrap it.
[01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:32.620]  Right.
[01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:39.260]  Uh, and I kind of see that, but to me, that's why Apple TV plus it's don't compare it to
[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:41.420]  Netscape or not a Netscape.
[01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:41.820]  Jesus.
[01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:47.900]  Netflix definitely don't compare it to Netflix is entire business is getting people to pay,
[01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:50.220]  you know, 10 or 15 bucks a month for Netflix.
[01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:50.540]  Right.
[01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:51.340]  That is there.
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:55.660]  It's, it's, you know, as sprawling as they're, that's, that's what they do.
[01:27:55.660 --> 01:28:01.180]  And it's kind of a thing of beauty, you know, that they pivoted from a will mail you DVDs
[01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:07.500]  at home to we've, we're now the preeminent library of streaming content that everybody
[01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:07.820]  has.
[01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:11.820]  Um, it's a thing of beauty because it's so nice and simple.
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:17.500]  And the value proposition is, will you watch, you know, 10 bucks of Netflix a month?
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:18.060]  Probably.
[01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:19.100]  So yeah, you'll get it.
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:26.060]  Um, the TV plus thing is to me more like Apple or, uh, uh, Amazon prime video where nobody
[01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:32.220]  signs up for Amazon prime to get prime video, you sign up for free shipping and then you,
[01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:36.540]  you have these prime shows you can watch and they're, you know, some of them are pretty
[01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:39.580]  good and you know, it's one of the easiest streaming things.
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:43.020]  If it went away for me, I really probably wouldn't miss it.
[01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:45.900]  And, but I'm glad I have it because every once in a while something comes up.
[01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:52.940]  Um, and I feel like TV plus for Apple is and always will be like that in that it will make
[01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:59.740]  way more sense in the context of an Apple one bundle where, okay, you know, you just
[01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:01.260]  give us like 25.
[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:01.740]  Okay.
[01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:03.100]  Add five, $30.
[01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:03.580]  All right.
[01:29:03.580 --> 01:29:07.340]  They'll give us, just give us something a month and we'll give you these TV shows too.
[01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:09.900]  Wow.
[01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:11.100]  Is the free year thing going on?
[01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:12.220]  It's still going on right now?
[01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:15.820]  Yeah, because they, it, well, it has to be because it started, they announced it
[01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:17.340]  with the iPhones, right?
[01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:24.300]  So the iPhones were last September 7th, 8th, 9th, something around there or 12th or something,
[01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:28.300]  you know, somewhere around September 11th, but never actually September 11th.
[01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:33.980]  Um, and they didn't actually sell, they actually announced it and they didn't sell the phones
[01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:35.100]  for another week or two.
[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:40.780]  So even the earliest, like if you bought a new iPhone at the very first day, your year
[01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:44.380]  of TV, like if you bought, if you bought, well, the reason I asked is I just bought
[01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:45.740]  Hank a new phone.
[01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:46.460]  Yeah, I think you do.
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:46.700]  Yeah.
[01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:50.860]  I think you still get, you, you should still get a year of, of TV plus.
[01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:51.360]  Yeah.
[01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:55.260]  Um, anyway, that's my recommendation.
[01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:55.980]  Anything else?
[01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:56.220]  Yeah.
[01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:58.220]  I guess the other thing, what a sad story.
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:01.580]  I don't want to end on 2% of a note, but this Chadwick Boseman.
[01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:02.060]  Yeah.
[01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:02.620]  Passing.
[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:03.340]  Oh my God.
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:07.180]  What a completely out of the blue for, you know, most everybody, right?
[01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:07.500]  Yeah.
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:07.740]  Yeah.
[01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:11.900]  They kept it private and I don't blame him, you know, but I mean, who would have thought
[01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:13.180]  it doesn't even make any sense.
[01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:18.540]  The guy had, was fighting cancer for four years while he was like the most fit.
[01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:20.940]  He had been literally played superhero.
[01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:22.860]  I mean, and looked apart.
[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:24.140]  Oh, and who else did he play?
[01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:29.340]  Well, he played Jackie Robinson, like one of the greatest athletes in the history of
[01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:30.300]  America.
[01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:35.740]  And he looked like one of the great athletes of America and he's fighting cancer and died.
[01:30:35.740 --> 01:30:40.860]  And my God, what a sad story, but I will just say, and I know everybody, you know, he was
[01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:43.420]  so talented, so amazing.
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:47.660]  And everybody knows Black Panther and ABC or Disney, I guess, did a really cool thing
[01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:51.820]  where they showed Black Panther on ABC, which everybody gets.
[01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:54.620]  You can even get it over the air commercial free.
[01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:55.180]  Yeah.
[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:56.220]  A night or two ago.
[01:30:56.220 --> 01:31:00.620]  What a, what a great way to truly, to honor him, no commercials and put a nice thing about
[01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:01.660]  his life afterwards.
[01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:07.740]  But I'll just say 42, the Jackie Robinson movie is one of my favorite sports movies
[01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:08.300]  of all time.
[01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:09.500]  And is one of right.
[01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:10.780]  Okay, I have not seen it.
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:11.820]  Oh, it's so good.
[01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:12.860]  I really recommend it.
[01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:14.700]  I, that'd be my last recommendation.
[01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:17.500]  Like I, you know, I don't have to say, go watch Black Panther.
[01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:22.860]  I mean, probably everybody's seen Black Panther, which is a great superhero movie, but 42 is
[01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:23.740]  just amazing.
[01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:28.940]  And in terms, you know, it's, you know, the sort of where we've come and how far we have
[01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:31.020]  to go with race relations in this country.
[01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:39.420]  It is as relevant, you know, sadly as more relevant than it should be in 2020, but he's
[01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:39.900]  so good.
[01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:42.700]  He's, he was such an amazing actor.
[01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:46.940]  You just don't think of him as, Oh, there's Chadwick Boseman.
[01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:49.740]  It's like, no, that's Jackie Robinson.
[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:50.300]  So good.
[01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:53.180]  So that would be my other recommendation is watch 42.
[01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:54.220]  I will check that out.
[01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:55.020]  You see, he died.
[01:31:55.020 --> 01:32:00.940]  It's, I'm not like a coincidence person, but he died on Jackie Robinson day in major
[01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:04.220]  league baseball, which is so weird.
[01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:08.140]  And it's not even usually, usually it's April 15th, but it couldn't be because they weren't
[01:32:08.140 --> 01:32:09.980]  playing baseball on April 15th.
[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:10.140]  Right.
[01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:13.580]  Anyway, this timeline.
[01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:17.260]  Anyway, that's my recommendation about this timeline.
[01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:19.820]  John, it's always good to talk to you.
[01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:22.460]  People can get plenty of discussion.
[01:32:22.460 --> 01:32:23.500]  People can hear it here.
[01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:30.140]  Hear your good voice on turning, turning this car around the podcast with, with our good
[01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:38.460]  friend, uh, Lex and, uh, Oh, you ever see, said his name, Lex and John Armstrong, John
[01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:39.180]  Armstrong.
[01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:40.140]  Also a good friend.
[01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:45.340]  Uh, you see the joke I had, I have some, some poor guy on Twitter fell right in the middle
[01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:45.580]  of it.
[01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:48.780]  Did you see the thread Lex and I had on Twitter?
[01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:54.300]  Uh, I skimmed past it cause I try, I'm trying not to doom scroll these days.
[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:59.180]  And I am, I am not, I am no longer, I used to be a completist as far as Twitter goes.
[01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:01.020]  And now I'm like, Nope, Nope, Nope.
[01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:01.580]  Not today.
[01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:06.460]  Lex had a tweet that was something to the lines of, Oh, is anybody else running into
[01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:10.300]  the thing or, you know, late summer and these troubling times they they're waking up at
[01:33:10.300 --> 01:33:15.180]  five 15 and it was literally said five 15 and I just wrote me too.
[01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:20.780]  And somebody wrote, yeah, how, how do you not be a morning person?
[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:24.540]  And just some random and I wrote, Oh, we're talking about five 15 in the morning.
[01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:31.180]  It was, I couldn't have set it up better with a sock puppet account.
[01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:36.540]  Anyway, John, I'm glad you got, I'm glad you got up early for this podcast.
[01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:39.340]  Ah, I am getting up earlier.
[01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:43.740]  I guess if 11 is early, who knows?
[01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:45.100]  Some days I do get up early.
[01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:46.380]  It's crazy times.
[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:48.140]  Anyway, good talking to you, John.
[01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:49.580]  Have a good holiday week.
[01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:50.460]  Oh yeah, I will.
[01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:50.860]  You too.
[01:33:50.860 --> 01:34:00.860]  Enjoy the pool.
