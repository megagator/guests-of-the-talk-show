[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  Ah, happy new year, Jim. First show of the year.
[00:04.000 --> 00:08.000]  Yeah, happy new year.
[00:08.000 --> 00:12.000]  It was very quiet. My son was here
[00:12.000 --> 00:16.000]  and we just did, you know, father-son things, picked up
[00:16.000 --> 00:20.000]  the guitar, played some Aussie, Metallica, you know, things every father
[00:20.000 --> 00:24.000]  and son does.
[00:24.000 --> 00:28.000]  We went out to dinner with friends early. Because
[00:28.000 --> 00:32.000]  New Year's Eve, I think New Year's Eve sucks. It's the worst, right?
[00:32.000 --> 00:36.000]  It's like you're young and you just think, well everybody goes out on New Year's Eve so I'm going out
[00:36.000 --> 00:40.000]  and you go out. And I don't remember ever having a good
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.000]  time on New Year's Eve. It's always crowded. The only time I ever remember having a good time on
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.000]  New Year's Eve, and it's very funny because sometimes it's like the security question on
[00:48.000 --> 00:52.000]  like your bank or whatever. They're like, where were you on New Year's Eve 1999?
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.000]  And I remember that one because we had friends in town here in Philly
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.000]  from Florida and we just stayed
[01:00.000 --> 01:04.000]  at me and Amy's place for the evening and then before midnight we went
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.000]  down to, there's a park called Penn's Landing.
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.000]  Not too far of a walk. And it was an
[01:12.000 --> 01:16.000]  unusually warm New Year's Eve for Philadelphia. So it wasn't like we were real cold. We just
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.000]  took a bottle of champagne with us and they have fireworks and we watched fireworks and it was very nice.
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.000]  But in other words, we didn't spend any money. We didn't have to wait in line anywhere. We didn't have to wait
[01:24.000 --> 01:28.000]  for a cab. We didn't have to drive anywhere. We just walked.
[01:28.000 --> 01:32.000]  Yes, if anybody asked me where were you on this New Year's Eve, I could
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.000]  just quickly say home. I just
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.000]  you know, it's so expensive to go out on New Year's Eve. It's like three times
[01:40.000 --> 01:44.000]  more expensive than like if you go out on December 30th, right?
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.000]  Right. And you know, it's even worse if you have kids because then you have to pay
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  like $10,000 for a babysitter.
[01:52.000 --> 01:56.000]  Then you have the exorbitantly priced dinner
[01:56.000 --> 02:00.000]  and drinks that you have to go for. And it just, it's the same
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.000]  thing every year. And I'd rather watch, I didn't even
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.000]  make it up until midnight. I fell asleep.
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.000]  I remember a couple years ago, Amy and I went out, I
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  don't remember if it was recent enough that we could just leave Jonas at home or if
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.000]  we had Amy's sister come and watch. I think we probably had her sister come and watch him.
[02:20.000 --> 02:24.000]  So we went out to one of our favorite restaurants and we
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.000]  went late so that we could ostensibly be there
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  at midnight. So it was a real late dinner, maybe like a 10 o'clock dinner. Stayed
[02:32.000 --> 02:36.000]  and did the countdown with the restaurant full of people.
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  And of course it was more expensive than usual and it wasn't as good because
[02:40.000 --> 02:44.000]  I feel like it was too crowded and you know, dinner was just
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.000]  slightly off. It wasn't bad, but slightly off. And then we leave and we're like, I don't know.
[02:48.000 --> 02:52.000]  It's like a mile and a half from our house. We're right here in center city,
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.000]  Philadelphia. But it's cold and Amy had heels on. She's not going to walk
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  but we couldn't get a cab. Just couldn't get a cab because
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  it's New Year's Eve and it was just past midnight. Could not get a cab.
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  So we thought, hey, let's just go to
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  a hotel right down the street. There's a hotel. They have a nice bar. We'll go there.
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.000]  We'll have one more drink and then by the time we're done, there'll be plenty of cabs. We go in and it's
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  only like 20 after midnight. And the hotel bar is just closed.
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.000]  It's just completely shut down because they want everybody out, right?
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.000]  Like ordinarily they would never be closed at 12, you know, 12
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.000]  midnight. They'd be open until like 2. But they're closed because they want everybody out because
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.000]  everybody's a drunken mass. So we started walking home and
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.000]  like her feet are hurting and eventually a cab comes by and we're only like
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  four blocks from our house. And I'm like, I don't care. I'll still get a cab. Her feet hurt.
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.000]  And the guy just rolls down his window, the cab driver, and he just says, where are you going?
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.000]  And I told him, you know, where our address is. He knows it's only four blocks
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.000]  from where we are. And he goes, he goes, 30 bucks.
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.000]  Oh my God. And it's going to be off the meter. And I was like,
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  oh my God, I can't believe this. But if it was my feet that hurt, I would
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.000]  say, you know, go fuck yourself. But it's 80 and I'm like, all right, all right.
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.000]  You know, I paid $30 to four blocks and a cab. We haven't gone
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.000]  out on New Year's Eve since. Yeah, I don't blame you. So we went
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  out, we went out early, like 5.30 to dinner with some friends in Chinatown.
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.000]  And, you know, a guy knows a guy.
[04:24.000 --> 04:28.000]  And so it wasn't like a fancy, you know, you would never even know it was New Year's Eve.
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.000]  Well, you know, I, we, a couple
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.000]  of friends of mine came over for a little bit and they
[04:36.000 --> 04:40.000]  brought, you know, like a pot of pulled
[04:40.000 --> 04:44.000]  pork and some
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.000]  buns, you know. And
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  we had that. But that was about it. Still, I
[04:52.000 --> 04:56.000]  didn't make it till midnight. I was kicking the milk. Get out, get out.
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.000]  I've got to go to bed.
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  I'll bet you're grumpy when you have to go to bed. I'm grumpy when
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.000]  I have to go to bed and when I haven't eaten.
[05:08.000 --> 05:12.000]  I've seen you when you're hungry. You're not in a good mood.
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.000]  Yeah, we ended up at
[05:16.000 --> 05:20.000]  what's that place in San Francisco, the House of Meat or something?
[05:20.000 --> 05:24.000]  House of Prime Rib. House of Prime Rib, yeah. Is that where you went?
[05:24.000 --> 05:28.000]  Or are you talking about me and you when you were hungry then? Yeah.
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  You were in a bad mood. Yeah, I was.
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  Well, they take care of you at House of Prime Rib. They don't leave hungry.
[05:36.000 --> 05:40.000]  No. So, I don't know.
[05:40.000 --> 05:44.000]  It's New Year's. There's not a lot of news to talk about. We've got year in review stuff we could talk about.
[05:44.000 --> 05:48.000]  I don't know if you wanted to start with anything.
[05:48.000 --> 05:52.000]  I saw this, and this to me is one of those topics where I know
[05:52.000 --> 05:56.000]  opinions are all over the map. And I know that some people think
[05:56.000 --> 06:00.000]  that I'm off my rocker on this, which is the question of where does
[06:00.000 --> 06:04.000]  Sudary stand compared to its competitors like Google Assistant
[06:04.000 --> 06:08.000]  and Alexa from Amazon.
[06:08.000 --> 06:12.000]  And I linked to a piece, who's this guy?
[06:12.000 --> 06:16.000]  What was his name?
[06:16.000 --> 06:20.000]  This guy at BirchTree.com where he did a study. He did 50 commands
[06:20.000 --> 06:24.000]  with Siri and Google Assistant. The exact same commands.
[06:24.000 --> 06:28.000]  And Siri actually did better on more of them than Google Assistant.
[06:28.000 --> 06:32.000]  Which does not surprise me.
[06:32.000 --> 06:36.000]  And I think the bottom line is that none of these things are actually good.
[06:36.000 --> 06:40.000]  Siri is not good. Google Assistant is not good. Alexa is not good.
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.000]  All of these things stink. And 10 years from now, we're going to look back at the state
[06:44.000 --> 06:48.000]  of all these things, and they're ridiculous.
[06:48.000 --> 06:52.000]  It's such early days, and they all fail in such frustrating ways
[06:52.000 --> 06:56.000]  compared to, even if you had a bad human
[06:56.000 --> 07:00.000]  personal assistant.
[07:00.000 --> 07:04.000]  They're like, I should fire this person and hire somebody else.
[07:04.000 --> 07:08.000]  But they're like, no
[07:08.000 --> 07:12.000]  human being is as stupid or as frustrating as these things are
[07:12.000 --> 07:16.000]  overall. In terms of if you're talking about a certain topic, and then you're
[07:16.000 --> 07:20.000]  like, well, go get me one of those. And they're like, what? You just can't
[07:20.000 --> 07:24.000]  talk to them the way you really want to. And we will. It's clear that that's what we're working towards.
[07:24.000 --> 07:28.000]  But I thought that this guy's thing. And then, of course, because people are
[07:28.000 --> 07:32.000]  very angry about Siri. This is like an emotional topic.
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.000]  That's one thing I don't get.
[07:36.000 --> 07:40.000]  And I'm not emotional about it. And I know that there are some people in there, they think
[07:40.000 --> 07:44.000]  that because I tend to like Apple products, I write about Apple,
[07:44.000 --> 07:48.000]  that they think that I'm somehow a home team cheerleader
[07:48.000 --> 07:52.000]  for Siri. I really don't think so. I think Siri stinks.
[07:52.000 --> 07:56.000]  I just think the other ones stink, too. And that in some ways, Siri
[07:56.000 --> 08:00.000]  is better in ways that are meaningful to me.
[08:00.000 --> 08:04.000]  But one of the things people said about this guy's study was that he was
[08:04.000 --> 08:08.000]  using, on an Android device, but he was using
[08:08.000 --> 08:12.000]  Google Allo to do the queries. And you type, it's like a little chatbot.
[08:12.000 --> 08:16.000]  So it's sort of like typing it in iMessage. So instead of
[08:16.000 --> 08:20.000]  dictating it verbally, he's typing. And they're saying, the argument is that
[08:20.000 --> 08:24.000]  that's not a fair comparison because the real Google Assistant is a voice-driven
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.000]  thing and it's only available on the Pixel phones. And he didn't have a Pixel phone.
[08:28.000 --> 08:32.000]  So I don't know. For me, it's
[08:32.000 --> 08:36.000]  about what you want to use it for. That's what it comes
[08:36.000 --> 08:40.000]  down to for me. So, Siri, and I said this yesterday
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.000]  about all of the things that are showing
[08:44.000 --> 08:48.000]  up at CES about Alexa. You know, that
[08:48.000 --> 08:52.000]  to me, Siri is the assistant that you carry
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.000]  with you. It's your mobile assistant. But
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.000]  Apple doesn't seem to be taking those steps for the home.
[09:00.000 --> 09:04.000]  So if you want, you know, an assistant in the
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  home, right now that seems to be Alexa. Matt Burchler is the name of the guy who
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.000]  wrote this story. I'll put it in the show notes. The difference between
[09:12.000 --> 09:16.000]  Google Assistant and Siri. And what he did is he made a video about it, which I think was a very
[09:16.000 --> 09:20.000]  useful way of doing it, where you can actually see the results live.
[09:20.000 --> 09:24.000]  Yeah, I just, I mean, what
[09:24.000 --> 09:28.000]  Amazon is doing right now is very smart. I mean, they're getting
[09:28.000 --> 09:32.000]  Alexa into as many products as they can so that they
[09:32.000 --> 09:36.000]  just become the default. And it's a very smart thing to do.
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.000]  Yeah, I wrote about this recently where there was an announcement
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.000]  that when Las Vegas is going to put
[09:44.000 --> 09:48.000]  Alexa or the Echo into
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.000]  all 4,800 of their hotel rooms in their Vegas property.
[09:52.000 --> 09:56.000]  And that, however much you want to say that this
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.000]  home device stuff is early days, you know, hey,
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.000]  5,000 hotel rooms here, 5,000 hotel rooms there, and all of a sudden you've got
[10:04.000 --> 10:08.000]  a sustained lead. Because things like that don't get replaced that often.
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.000]  You know, it's like, how long did it take hotel rooms to get rid of the
[10:12.000 --> 10:16.000]  30-pin chargers on their alarm clocks?
[10:16.000 --> 10:20.000]  I mean, seriously, every once in a while, I don't know the last time I saw
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.000]  one of those, but until recently I occasionally would. The alarm
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.000]  clock would have the 30-pin charger. I mean, that's like, what, five,
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.000]  six years old? In terms of the last time you could buy an iPhone and add one of those?
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.000]  You know, Wind puts 5,000 of these Alexa things
[10:36.000 --> 10:40.000]  in there and hooks up all of the lights and 4,000 rooms
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  full of lights and shades and the window blinds
[10:44.000 --> 10:48.000]  to Alexa. They're not going to replace it with another device, you know,
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  next year. Nope. And so it seems,
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.000]  how would you summarize the news coming out of CES? You wrote this,
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.000]  you got this story on your site. Alexa is everywhere. I'll put that in the share notes.
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  Yeah, I just never liked CES to be
[11:04.000 --> 11:08.000]  honest with you. Did you ever go? I did. Yeah, I went for a few years.
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.000]  And it's just craziness. Because
[11:12.000 --> 11:16.000]  a lot
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.000]  of the stuff that you see at CES aren't real products.
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.000]  And it's difficult to really
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.000]  assess what's happening in terms of
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.000]  consumer electronics when, you know, 80%
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.000]  of the products aren't real or 70% or 60%. You know,
[11:36.000 --> 11:40.000]  they're bringing proof of concept things to CES
[11:40.000 --> 11:44.000]  to see how people react to them.
[11:44.000 --> 11:48.000]  So, the news out of CES to me
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  is just always, every year is just kind of, eh.
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.000]  Well, how would you summarize the Alexa news?
[11:56.000 --> 12:00.000]  Well, the Alexa news I find very interesting not because of Alexa,
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  but because everybody is choosing that platform.
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.000]  And... Well, and partially
[12:08.000 --> 12:12.000]  because it's a story down on your site,
[12:12.000 --> 12:16.000]  Dave Mark wrote it, that they're following the Netflix strategy
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.000]  of trying to embed Alexa everywhere that they can in a way
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.000]  that Netflix seemingly, if you've
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.000]  got a box that makes video come out of it, Netflix is
[12:28.000 --> 12:32.000]  willing to put a Netflix app on that box.
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.000]  I mean, can you buy a video box that doesn't come with
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.000]  Netflix? I don't even know if you can.
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  I don't know. It's everywhere. I mean, it's even on Comcast now.
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  You know, that Xfinity thing. So, yeah, it's everywhere.
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  Yeah, I had a relative who had that with their Comcast thing and
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.000]  that blew me away. It really surprised me that Comcast would do that
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  because you would kind of think Comcast wants to keep you tied to the cable channels.
[13:00.000 --> 13:04.000]  Yeah. Yeah, so there's like
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  other companies... Among the things I've seen is that there are
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.000]  other companies coming out with Echo-like docs.
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.000]  Some of them... Who was the one who was working with, like, Harman Kardon to make
[13:16.000 --> 13:20.000]  a really good speaker? So if you're
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.000]  gripe about the Amazon Echo is
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.000]  hey, I want one of these things. I would get the Amazon version, but
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.000]  I really want better sound quality than this. Instead of doing it themselves,
[13:32.000 --> 13:36.000]  they've just licensed the Alexa
[13:36.000 --> 13:40.000]  technology to these other companies. But other things too, though, like
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.000]  Ford Motor Company announced that they're going to
[13:44.000 --> 13:48.000]  put Alexa into their cars.
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.000]  I don't know. It just seems like they're running away with this.
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.000]  Do you have a voice assistant at home? Do you have Google
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.000]  or Alexa? I have the Alexa thing in the kitchen and we never use it.
[14:00.000 --> 14:04.000]  But on the other hand... No, we really don't. Honest to God.
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.000]  I got it so I could try it and it just felt like a reasonable
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.000]  business expense and maybe we would like it. But one thing is we don't have
[14:12.000 --> 14:16.000]  any smart light bulbs or anything like that.
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  We don't have any smart anything in the house because we're moving somewhat soon,
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.000]  supposedly. It's a long story. But it doesn't make any sense to buy
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.000]  stuff like that for the place we live now. And everybody I know who does like Alexa,
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.000]  like Ben Thompson really likes it, has stuff in
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.000]  the house where you can say things like, turn out the kitchen lights or
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.000]  whatever. But we don't have anything like that.
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.000]  And for the stuff I do do, it doesn't work as well as Siri for me.
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.000]  I can't stand the way... Usually, I've said this before on the show
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  and I don't want to be a broken record, but a lot of times all I care about,
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.000]  especially when I'm in our kitchen, our kitchen has windows so I can see what the weather's like. I can see if it's
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  raining or sunny or whatever. All I want to know is the temperature outside.
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.000]  And Alexa, if you say, what's the temperature? She understands it,
[15:04.000 --> 15:08.000]  but all she does is give you a full weather report for the day, which I don't want.
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.000]  It takes like 30 seconds. And if you ask Siri for the temperature,
[15:12.000 --> 15:16.000]  she just tells you the temperature.
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.000]  But that leads me to something that I want to complain about, Siri.
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.000]  So with Siri, when you ask
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.000]  the temperature, I don't know what the threshold is, but somewhere
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  around freezing, maybe it's
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.000]  under 40 degrees Fahrenheit or so, she answers with
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.000]  brrrrr and then tells you the temperature.
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.000]  Every goddamn time.
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.000]  And this to me is one of the worst things about Siri, the cutesiness of trying
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.000]  to be funny. If you're not asking her to be funny,
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.000]  because it's not funny. That's not funny at all.
[15:56.000 --> 16:00.000]  It's funny to me. Well, but no human being would
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.000]  do that. If I had a real human assistant,
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.000]  and they knew the temperature, they would never say
[16:08.000 --> 16:12.000]  brrr, it's 33 degrees. And if they did,
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.000]  they would do it once. And maybe only in the context of
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.000]  a surprisingly cold day. If it was the middle of September and the temperature
[16:20.000 --> 16:24.000]  dropped to an unusual degree, you could say something like that. But
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.000]  on the East Coast in Philadelphia in January, it's completely
[16:28.000 --> 16:32.000]  normal for it to be 33 degrees. There's nothing unusual about it at all.
[16:32.000 --> 16:36.000]  And so it's not funny. It's just annoying.
[16:36.000 --> 16:40.000]  Every time. Right.
[16:40.000 --> 16:44.000]  You know what I mean? I don't want my computers to work like that.
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.000]  I realize that the conversational nature of Siri is a little different than using the Mac,
[16:48.000 --> 16:52.000]  but it's like...
[16:52.000 --> 16:56.000]  I make a new numbers spreadsheet, and I
[16:56.000 --> 17:00.000]  title it 2016
[17:00.000 --> 17:04.000]  Daring Fireball Company Expenses, because I'm getting ready
[17:04.000 --> 17:08.000]  to go get my taxes done. I don't want the computer, when I hit return on saving
[17:08.000 --> 17:12.000]  the file, to say, tax time again, huh?
[17:12.000 --> 17:16.000]  Right? I don't want my computer making weird,
[17:16.000 --> 17:20.000]  obvious duh comments like that. But yet, Siri does.
[17:20.000 --> 17:24.000]  Just tell me the goddamn temperature.
[17:24.000 --> 17:28.000]  Are they trying to make Siri more, I don't know, friendly?
[17:28.000 --> 17:32.000]  Yeah, but that's not friendly, though. To me, I guess that's obviously the intent, is to try to
[17:32.000 --> 17:36.000]  make it friendly, but it's not, because it's so phony, because it's every day. Every single
[17:36.000 --> 17:40.000]  day. Right? And that, to me, has the opposite effect, where it just makes it
[17:40.000 --> 17:44.000]  seem...it's more artificial than if
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.000]  she just said 33 degrees, you know, going
[17:48.000 --> 17:52.000]  down to whatever. Right.
[17:52.000 --> 17:56.000]  I find it incredibly annoying. But then on the other side, you have
[17:56.000 --> 18:00.000]  Alexa giving you full weather forecast
[18:00.000 --> 18:04.000]  when all you want is the temperature. The thing with this Alexa Everywhere is
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.000]  I don't quite know how it's going to tie into being personal.
[18:08.000 --> 18:12.000]  In terms of...
[18:12.000 --> 18:16.000]  Amazon just doesn't know that much about me. You can do things like
[18:16.000 --> 18:20.000]  say, add to my shopping list, and it's just like
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.000]  your Amazon shopping list, but it's like...and I think there's
[18:24.000 --> 18:28.000]  a way you can hook up your Google Calendar, but I don't use Google Calendar.
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.000]  Siri has an advantage on things like access to my actual calendar
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.000]  that Alexa's never going to have. Right.
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  And I don't think...Alexa can't send text messages or iMessages.
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.000]  Certainly not iMessages. And I don't think it can send text
[18:44.000 --> 18:48.000]  messages. So, I don't know. It seems
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.000]  more about information and controlling, like, just
[18:52.000 --> 18:56.000]  controlling your environment with the lights and playing music than about being a real personal assistant.
[18:56.000 --> 19:00.000]  Well, and I'm the same way as you. I don't
[19:00.000 --> 19:04.000]  have the light bulbs, and I don't...but I...
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.000]  when I think of a personal assistant in the home, I think
[19:08.000 --> 19:12.000]  of having something that will
[19:12.000 --> 19:16.000]  be more interactive with me and my surroundings
[19:16.000 --> 19:20.000]  than what anything is right now. Maybe that's why I don't
[19:20.000 --> 19:24.000]  really...I haven't gone out and purchased one of these, because it doesn't really do
[19:24.000 --> 19:28.000]  anything besides answer questions.
[19:28.000 --> 19:32.000]  You know? I mean, I don't know...
[19:32.000 --> 19:36.000]  Merlin.
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.000]  Loves his. Ben Thompson does, too.
[19:40.000 --> 19:44.000]  Yeah. So, I don't know. I mean, maybe I'm just
[19:44.000 --> 19:48.000]  not seeing it. Yeah, I don't know. But right now,
[19:48.000 --> 19:52.000]  I mean, if I sat down now, and even if there was a sale on Alexa
[19:52.000 --> 19:56.000]  this afternoon, I don't think I'd buy one. Because I just...
[19:56.000 --> 20:00.000]  I don't think it's going to do a whole lot for me. I mean, look at
[20:00.000 --> 20:04.000]  the Google commercial about the little boy that's saying...trying to make the
[20:04.000 --> 20:08.000]  dog disappear. And he's trying to figure out what the magic word is.
[20:08.000 --> 20:12.000]  I mean, that's cute, but it really didn't do anything.
[20:12.000 --> 20:16.000]  So,
[20:16.000 --> 20:20.000]  I don't know. I keep coming back to this solve a problem
[20:20.000 --> 20:24.000]  thing. How much is Alexa solving a problem?
[20:24.000 --> 20:28.000]  Right now, none. The new products...
[20:28.000 --> 20:32.000]  it may. But
[20:32.000 --> 20:36.000]  I just don't see what it's doing for me that
[20:36.000 --> 20:40.000]  is so great that I just can't do it myself.
[20:40.000 --> 20:44.000]  I see how eventually it will. I think eventually
[20:44.000 --> 20:48.000]  it's going to be amazing. I really do. I think
[20:48.000 --> 20:52.000]  if you could just tell your assistant, hey, I'm
[20:52.000 --> 20:56.000]  flying to San Francisco
[20:56.000 --> 21:00.000]  on these dates. What are my choices for
[21:00.000 --> 21:04.000]  flights from American Airlines? And then have Siri
[21:04.000 --> 21:08.000]  come back in a couple of seconds and just have an ordered list of
[21:08.000 --> 21:12.000]  direct flights from Philly to San Francisco. That would be fantastic.
[21:12.000 --> 21:16.000]  Isn't that what that new one did that Samsung
[21:16.000 --> 21:20.000]  bought? Yeah, sort of. But again,
[21:20.000 --> 21:24.000]  I think that's a lot like CES or Viv. And Viv was created...that's the one
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.000]  that's created by the people who originally created Siri. So they have
[21:28.000 --> 21:32.000]  a track record. It's not like they're...like they don't have a track
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.000]  record. But I don't think...I think it was
[21:36.000 --> 21:40.000]  sort of a proof of concept when they demoed it. I don't think it was a real...
[21:40.000 --> 21:44.000]  it really couldn't do the things that they were showing.
[21:44.000 --> 21:48.000]  But that's where they...
[21:48.000 --> 21:52.000]  where they're going with it. It seemed...and
[21:52.000 --> 21:56.000]  this is...when everybody saw that, we all...
[21:56.000 --> 22:00.000]  everybody freaked out because Siri couldn't do
[22:00.000 --> 22:04.000]  those things. But we don't know that Siri can't do those things. We just know
[22:04.000 --> 22:08.000]  that the Siri that we have can't. So we're very
[22:08.000 --> 22:12.000]  quick to jump on Apple
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.000]  and say that they're not doing things. But Siri could outdo Viv right now in
[22:16.000 --> 22:20.000]  the prototype models. Bottom line for me
[22:20.000 --> 22:24.000]  is not that...again, not that Siri is behind these
[22:24.000 --> 22:28.000]  other companies, but that they all still stink overall. And they're better...
[22:28.000 --> 22:32.000]  but they're very different at different things. Like one of the things that most people really praise
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.000]  Alexa for is that once you know exactly what to say
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.000]  to it, it'll get it every time. And the response time...
[22:40.000 --> 22:44.000]  turnaround response time is faster for a lot of people with
[22:44.000 --> 22:48.000]  Alexa in terms of how long do you have to wait. The thing that matters...
[22:48.000 --> 22:52.000]  the reason it all matters...and a perfect example of why it matters
[22:52.000 --> 22:56.000]  is AirPods, right? Because Siri is a big part of
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.000]  AirPods. And I know my wife loves her. She really, really loves them. And she
[23:00.000 --> 23:04.000]  switched from Siri to having double-tap Play Pause because
[23:04.000 --> 23:08.000]  she finds the need to pause without taking it out a lot.
[23:08.000 --> 23:12.000]  And so she even tweeted that switching it to Play Pause
[23:12.000 --> 23:16.000]  was a game changer. It really made her...that preference
[23:16.000 --> 23:20.000]  setting made her go from mostly liking AirPods to
[23:20.000 --> 23:24.000]  loving AirPods. I set mine like that
[23:24.000 --> 23:28.000]  a day after I had them in when I figured out how to change that setting.
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.000]  I've kept it on Siri almost since...
[23:32.000 --> 23:36.000]  I had it on Play Pause for a little bit, but I like taking it out.
[23:36.000 --> 23:40.000]  And usually it works for me. Not works like
[23:40.000 --> 23:44.000]  functioning works, but in practical terms, it's fine for me to
[23:44.000 --> 23:48.000]  just take it out to Play Pause. So I keep it on Siri. So I use the
[23:48.000 --> 23:52.000]  Siri a lot. But the biggest annoyance
[23:52.000 --> 23:56.000]  for me is the pause between when I double-tap it and when I
[23:56.000 --> 24:00.000]  get the prompt. And I'm so...
[24:00.000 --> 24:04.000]  what's the word...impatient that a lot
[24:04.000 --> 24:08.000]  of times I'll start saying what I want to say before it's actually
[24:08.000 --> 24:12.000]  listening. The accuracy is probably...it's probably the most
[24:12.000 --> 24:16.000]  accurate Siri product I know. And I don't know if that's because the microphone is
[24:16.000 --> 24:20.000]  right there, you know, so close to my mouth. I don't know
[24:20.000 --> 24:24.000]  if it's because there's two of them. I don't know if
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.000]  they're doing funny stuff like getting it out of the bones in my
[24:28.000 --> 24:32.000]  ear or whatever. But it's very, very accurate. When I dictate
[24:32.000 --> 24:36.000]  into AirPods, the accuracy is the highest of any product.
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.000]  But that pause between the second
[24:40.000 --> 24:44.000]  tap and when it's actually listening is infuriating.
[24:44.000 --> 24:48.000]  Yeah, I do the same thing as you. It's like when it's on
[24:48.000 --> 24:52.000]  Bluetooth in the car. Have you tried that?
[24:52.000 --> 24:56.000]  It's on Bluetooth in the car and you press it and there's this long pause
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.000]  and I've already started talking just out of habit. And the pause is even longer
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.000]  than normal. And I get that it's because it's
[25:04.000 --> 25:08.000]  over Bluetooth and it's kind of connecting as a phone call or
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.000]  however it does it. But still, it's not optimal.
[25:12.000 --> 25:16.000]  I think that the number one way that Siri needs to improve
[25:16.000 --> 25:20.000]  is response time. Beyond any, just don't even get
[25:20.000 --> 25:24.000]  into the what Siri can do and the accuracy and whatever.
[25:24.000 --> 25:28.000]  But getting the response time as close to zero as possible I think is essential.
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.000]  And I think in all of computing, people recognize that that's
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.000]  it doesn't matter what field you're in. Eventually, anything where there's a delay
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.000]  if you don't get rid of that delay, the product
[25:40.000 --> 25:44.000]  falls by the wayside. I remember back
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.000]  when we had floppy disks, when you'd hit command S, you'd have to wait a bit
[25:48.000 --> 25:52.000]  just for a word processing file to save. And you'd hear the floppy going
[25:52.000 --> 25:56.000]  Oh my.
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.000]  You'd have to wait, but you don't have to wait anymore. Well, now it does it automatically.
[26:00.000 --> 26:04.000]  That's the whole thing. We know that
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  this is going to be a lot different in the
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.000]  coming years. It's just, right now, I have difficulty
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.000]  finding
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.000]  the usefulness for all of this stuff. Here's
[26:20.000 --> 26:24.000]  another example. Apple Maps. It's very cool. It really is.
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.000]  But if you're going somewhere where you don't
[26:28.000 --> 26:32.000]  know, Apple Maps will
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.000]  just say, in a half a mile
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.000]  turn left. Whereas Google Maps
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  is more
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.000]  interactive, more friendly, more
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.000]  detailed. Google Maps will say, in half a mile
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.000]  use the left two lanes to turn left.
[26:56.000 --> 27:00.000]  Okay, now I know what my options are. Or if you're
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.000]  coming to one of those intersections on the freeway,
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.000]  Google Maps will say, in one mile
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.000]  use the right two lanes to take the exit here, then keep
[27:12.000 --> 27:16.000]  left. Then use the left lane to keep left.
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.000]  That's useful. That is very useful.
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.000]  To just say, keep right,
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.000]  and then a lot of times there's a fork in the road when you keep right, and then it says now keep
[27:28.000 --> 27:32.000]  left. It doesn't say
[27:32.000 --> 27:36.000]  everything that you need, I think, to be
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.000]  to allow you to be as successful in your journey.
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  So, I love Apple Maps. I think it's great.
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.000]  It's a very cool interface.
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.000]  For the most part, it gives great directions. The directions
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.000]  are basically the same. They're just more detailed in areas
[27:56.000 --> 28:00.000]  that you don't know to allow you. And I actually used it
[28:00.000 --> 28:04.000]  on Christmas Day. I went to visit a friend.
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.000]  I had only been to their house one time before
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.000]  and I had been playing around. Of course,
[28:12.000 --> 28:16.000]  like we all do, we play around with the apps all the time.
[28:16.000 --> 28:20.000]  And I was playing around with Google Maps and I used it
[28:20.000 --> 28:24.000]  and it clued into me how much that
[28:24.000 --> 28:28.000]  mattered. That little detail mattered in areas where
[28:28.000 --> 28:32.000]  I didn't know where I was going. So,
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.000]  that's a situation where, yeah, this actually did
[28:36.000 --> 28:40.000]  help solve a problem for me. I wasn't turning into
[28:40.000 --> 28:44.000]  the middle lane and then waiting for Apple Maps
[28:44.000 --> 28:48.000]  to say which way I have to turn. Right, or something as humane as
[28:48.000 --> 28:52.000]  saying if it tells you you can be in either of the two left lanes,
[28:52.000 --> 28:56.000]  and you're already in the one closer to the center, then you know you're already good
[28:56.000 --> 29:00.000]  and you don't have to worry about merging one more lane over just because you know you have to make a left.
[29:00.000 --> 29:04.000]  That's actually very useful information. And it's the sort of thing that once you're familiar
[29:04.000 --> 29:08.000]  with a route to a certain, you just do that,
[29:08.000 --> 29:12.000]  your brain does that automatically. You're like, oh yeah, I know I'm good. There's two lanes
[29:12.000 --> 29:16.000]  that go right here because it's a busy exit. And actually,
[29:16.000 --> 29:20.000]  after I make that left turn, I have to make an immediate right, so
[29:20.000 --> 29:24.000]  I better stay in the second most left lane.
[29:24.000 --> 29:28.000]  Because that's where I'll want to turn. And see, those are just the
[29:28.000 --> 29:32.000]  types of things that I, when I talk about the
[29:32.000 --> 29:36.000]  usefulness, that to me is very useful. And I
[29:36.000 --> 29:40.000]  really like that. Alright, let me take a break here and thank one of our good friends at MailChimp.
[29:40.000 --> 29:44.000]  Twelve million people use MailChimp to
[29:44.000 --> 29:48.000]  connect with their customers, market their products, and grow their e-commerce businesses
[29:48.000 --> 29:52.000]  every day. They send a lot of email out of MailChimp. What are some of the
[29:52.000 --> 29:56.000]  things you can do? Well, you can use MailChimp to send an onboarding series to
[29:56.000 --> 30:00.000]  introduce new subscribers or users to your business or organization or
[30:00.000 --> 30:04.000]  app or whatever it is. You can automatically follow up with customers after a purchase
[30:04.000 --> 30:08.000]  and recommend other products that they'll love. You can surprise your best customers with a coupon
[30:08.000 --> 30:12.000]  triggered by their shopping behavior. All sorts of ideas
[30:12.000 --> 30:16.000]  and all sorts of integrations. They integrate with WordPress, Facebook,
[30:16.000 --> 30:20.000]  online store packages like Shopify and Magento.
[30:20.000 --> 30:24.000]  They integrate with all of these apps and web services that you use
[30:24.000 --> 30:28.000]  every day. What are the prices? You can send up to 12,000 emails
[30:28.000 --> 30:32.000]  a month to a list of up to 2,000 subscribers with MailChimp's
[30:32.000 --> 30:36.000]  forever free plan. Guess how much
[30:36.000 --> 30:40.000]  that costs? The forever free plan. Well, it's free. And guess how long it's free for?
[30:40.000 --> 30:44.000]  It's free forever. As long as you've got 2,000 or fewer
[30:44.000 --> 30:48.000]  subscribers across all lists in your account, you can send up to 12,000 emails a month
[30:48.000 --> 30:52.000]  without paying MailChimp a dime. They won't even ask for a credit card.
[30:52.000 --> 30:56.000]  And if you have more than that, if you have more than
[30:56.000 --> 31:00.000]  2,000 customers, well then you're already doing well. You can afford to pay. And the prices
[31:00.000 --> 31:04.000]  are amazing. So go to MailChimp.com and get started.
[31:04.000 --> 31:08.000]  That's it. MailChimp.com. There's no coupon, no code, nothing else to remember.
[31:08.000 --> 31:12.000]  Just go to MailChimp.com and see what they have to offer. They're
[31:12.000 --> 31:16.000]  an unbelievable service. Unbelievable company. Really great friends of the show.
[31:16.000 --> 31:20.000]  They've sponsored us forever. Including, I think, every year that we've done it
[31:20.000 --> 31:24.000]  they've been the sponsor of the open bar
[31:24.000 --> 31:28.000]  at the live talk show at WWDC.
[31:28.000 --> 31:32.000]  I use MailChimp all the time for the loop.
[31:32.000 --> 31:36.000]  Honestly, I don't even know who their competitors are.
[31:36.000 --> 31:40.000]  It's like they're so far above the best at doing
[31:40.000 --> 31:44.000]  personalized email that I don't even know what you would say.
[31:44.000 --> 31:48.000]  Anyway, if you have any kind of needs for email, or if maybe you don't even know you have needs for email
[31:48.000 --> 31:52.000]  go check out MailChimp.com. Alright, what about this?
[31:52.000 --> 31:56.000]  There was a really good article by Chuck von Rossbach. He called it
[31:56.000 --> 32:00.000]  Apple's 2016 Year in Review. And I thought it was really thoughtful. I didn't agree with everything
[32:00.000 --> 32:04.000]  that he wrote, but that's the way the world works.
[32:04.000 --> 32:08.000]  But I thought he made a couple of good points in particular on the
[32:08.000 --> 32:12.000]  airport base stations and the Mac Pro lineups
[32:12.000 --> 32:16.000]  in particular. And the thing that both of these
[32:16.000 --> 32:20.000]  products have in common, I mean, obviously the Mac Pro is a very expensive product
[32:20.000 --> 32:24.000]  it's core to a lot of people's relationship with Apple
[32:24.000 --> 32:28.000]  if you're a professional that has a need for a Mac Pro, this is probably
[32:28.000 --> 32:32.000]  the most important thing that Apple makes for you. Very expensive, too.
[32:32.000 --> 32:36.000]  I guess it's Apple's most expensive product, right? I mean, I can't imagine that there's anything else
[32:36.000 --> 32:40.000]  that's more expensive than a tripped out Mac Pro.
[32:40.000 --> 32:44.000]  Airport base stations are not. They're sort of an other. I don't even know what
[32:44.000 --> 32:48.000]  category they put them in on the Apple website, but it's sort of like a little peripheral
[32:48.000 --> 32:52.000]  and they're not very expensive and it's just sort of
[32:52.000 --> 32:56.000]  a way to keep you in the Apple ecosystem and to make sure that
[32:56.000 --> 33:00.000]  you have an Apple-like experience setting up Wi-Fi in your house where you
[33:00.000 --> 33:04.000]  get a nice little app on your phone and it's very easy to
[33:04.000 --> 33:08.000]  understand how to set it up from a consumer's point of view. And
[33:08.000 --> 33:12.000]  because if you're using an Apple airport, you know that things like
[33:12.000 --> 33:16.000]  back to your Mac or whatever should work.
[33:16.000 --> 33:20.000]  The features that Apple
[33:20.000 --> 33:24.000]  has for the products that operate over the internet
[33:24.000 --> 33:28.000]  presumably they're going to work better, or at least as
[33:28.000 --> 33:32.000]  they're expected to, with an airport base station. But the thing with both of these products is they
[33:32.000 --> 33:36.000]  are terribly out of date, but yet Apple is still
[33:36.000 --> 33:40.000]  selling them at the same prices as when they came out.
[33:40.000 --> 33:44.000]  And I don't know. And there was a story, Gurman had a story a couple months ago that
[33:44.000 --> 33:48.000]  Apple's getting out of the airport game and that they've reassigned the
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.000]  engineers who were previously working on airport base stations to other teams.
[33:52.000 --> 33:56.000]  So who knows what's going on there.
[33:56.000 --> 34:00.000]  You know what's interesting about 2016 is that
[34:00.000 --> 34:04.000]  the products that had the least amount of
[34:04.000 --> 34:08.000]  updates are the ones that are getting the most amount of news.
[34:08.000 --> 34:12.000]  The Mac didn't have a lot
[34:12.000 --> 34:16.000]  of updates, especially the Mac Pro and iMac,
[34:16.000 --> 34:20.000]  but that's what everybody's talking about.
[34:20.000 --> 34:24.000]  I don't think that they're abandoning
[34:24.000 --> 34:28.000]  the Mac. Well, we can get to the Mac in a bit, and I
[34:28.000 --> 34:32.000]  don't think so either. But with the airport, it's a simpler story, I
[34:32.000 --> 34:36.000]  think. Well, it has to be because it's either they're, you know,
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.000]  it's a simpler product. Do you think Apple should still be making
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.000]  airport base stations? I would love for them
[34:44.000 --> 34:48.000]  to still make airport base stations because I think that they're good.
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.000]  You know, they
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.000]  I guess the argument against it is that there are plenty of other companies that make
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.000]  just fine products, so there's no
[35:00.000 --> 35:04.000]  no way for Apple to really stand out. Like, Apple's
[35:04.000 --> 35:08.000]  Apple should focus on the products that they can
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.000]  build that are best in class, right? Like the iPhone, in my opinion,
[35:12.000 --> 35:16.000]  is far and away the best phone that you can buy, and it's not
[35:16.000 --> 35:20.000]  you know, to me it's not even close. And the difference is, even if you disagree that
[35:20.000 --> 35:24.000]  it's the best, you can certainly see how it's different because it's the only phone that runs iOS.
[35:24.000 --> 35:28.000]  And iOS is a huge thing. The only reason I think that Apple
[35:28.000 --> 35:32.000]  is not best in class in the products that it builds is because those are the products
[35:32.000 --> 35:36.000]  that it's not focusing on. I mean, there was a time when the airport
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.000]  time machine, time capsule,
[35:40.000 --> 35:44.000]  they were best. Yeah, they were, definitely.
[35:44.000 --> 35:48.000]  I thought, especially when you take into consideration not just how they function once
[35:48.000 --> 35:52.000]  set up, but the setup process itself.
[35:52.000 --> 35:56.000]  Because I remember the one time, at one point I did have a
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.000]  I forget if it was Linksys. I think it was a
[36:00.000 --> 36:04.000]  Linksys. And it was ridiculous how you configured
[36:04.000 --> 36:08.000]  the thing. It was like you had to go to a special, you'd turn it on and you'd
[36:08.000 --> 36:12.000]  point your web browser on your computer to a certain IP address that wasn't
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  outside. It was right there on the Linksys and type a password
[36:16.000 --> 36:20.000]  and it was like nobody ever changed the password, you know.
[36:20.000 --> 36:24.000]  You could. I did, of course, but most people didn't. And it was like, it's
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.000]  stupid. It was like the password was admin or something like that. And then you'd
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.000]  configure it in your web browser. And it was like, you really
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.000]  had to be a low level network engineer to understand
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.000]  what anything meant. It was really, really difficult.
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.000]  And whereas, right from the get-go, Airport, you'd configure
[36:44.000 --> 36:48.000]  it with a really nice app on your Mac that was just like everything else.
[36:48.000 --> 36:52.000]  It was easy Mac style interface to configure this
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.000]  stuff. I don't know that they're not alone in that, though. And they have,
[36:56.000 --> 37:00.000]  I will just say this just to
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.000]  full disclosure, Eero has sponsored the talk show a couple
[37:04.000 --> 37:08.000]  of times. They're not a sponsor this week. I don't think they're coming up soon either.
[37:08.000 --> 37:12.000]  But they have sponsored the site. And they gave me as part
[37:12.000 --> 37:16.000]  of the sponsorship a three-pack of Eero's. So the Eero's I have set up here are
[37:16.000 --> 37:20.000]  complimentary as part of the sponsorship package.
[37:20.000 --> 37:24.000]  It's better, and I have a couple of friends who I know also have Eero's set
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.000]  up. I haven't heard from one of them who didn't
[37:28.000 --> 37:32.000]  get a better network in their house
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.000]  after switching from like Airport, or some of them weren't even using
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.000]  Airport before, but whatever they did. Eero gives them a better, their house has better
[37:40.000 --> 37:44.000]  faster internet now. Take a speed test
[37:44.000 --> 37:48.000]  with your old internet, take it out, put the Eero's in, take another
[37:48.000 --> 37:52.000]  speed test, and you get better results. And they have a nice
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.000]  ad. I don't know that Apple could do better than Eero. I really don't. I think they could
[37:56.000 --> 38:00.000]  do as good, but I don't know that they can do better. And I know there's a couple of other
[38:00.000 --> 38:04.000]  companies that are doing the same thing with these mesh networks, where you have a couple
[38:04.000 --> 38:08.000]  of devices around your house. I don't know.
[38:08.000 --> 38:12.000]  But I do know this. If they're going to sell them, they should
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.000]  have updated hardware that's competitive with its current state of the art. And if
[38:16.000 --> 38:20.000]  they're not, they should get the hell out of the business and
[38:20.000 --> 38:24.000]  put Eero's or some other brand in the Apple Store and tell people to buy those instead.
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.000]  As it stands right now, if you go into the Apple Store and you're like
[38:28.000 --> 38:32.000]  hey, I just moved to a new apartment, I want to get a new, set up a new
[38:32.000 --> 38:36.000]  WiFi network. If you go in the Apple Store and do it, you're going to get, right now, today,
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.000]  as we record, you're going to get a substandard product. Like that's
[38:40.000 --> 38:44.000]  antithetical to the Apple brand.
[38:44.000 --> 38:48.000]  I really do believe that, and I really
[38:48.000 --> 38:52.000]  do stand by this. I think it's true that the Apple brand, a big part of it
[38:52.000 --> 38:56.000]  for non-expert users, is that you can go
[38:56.000 --> 39:00.000]  to the Apple Store and buy, if they sell it, what you're buying from them
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.000]  will be one of the best, a great product.
[39:04.000 --> 39:08.000]  It doesn't matter what it is. If you're going in to buy a phone, you're going to get an iPhone. If you're going to get a laptop,
[39:08.000 --> 39:12.000]  you're going to get a MacBook. These are great products.
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.000]  For stuff that they, the other type of stuff they sell from third parties, they're good stuff.
[39:16.000 --> 39:20.000]  Like if you get an iPhone case from the Apple Store, it's going to be a good case.
[39:20.000 --> 39:24.000]  It's not going to be a piece of junk. But if you get a base station today, you're going to get one that's slower
[39:24.000 --> 39:28.000]  than if you bought Eros. So I think they should either
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.000]  get out of the business or update the hardware.
[39:32.000 --> 39:36.000]  I might have to try that out, Eros. I just don't get, do you get it?
[39:36.000 --> 39:40.000]  I don't get why they're still selling.
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.000]  I think with the Mac Pro, and we can
[39:44.000 --> 39:48.000]  segue here into the Mac Pro, I think with the Mac Pro
[39:48.000 --> 39:52.000]  my guess is that something went terribly wrong with
[39:52.000 --> 39:56.000]  that radical new design of the trash can Mac Pro.
[39:56.000 --> 40:00.000]  Whether it's hard to make, whether this factory in the United States
[40:00.000 --> 40:04.000]  where it's at Austin isn't working out and that they
[40:04.000 --> 40:08.000]  if they, it's some kind of thing where they anticipated
[40:08.000 --> 40:12.000]  that it would be easy to get new updated chips and
[40:12.000 --> 40:16.000]  GPUs and put them in the same design and it's not, if it's
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.000]  proving too expensive to make and they need to redesign
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.000]  and if they had to redesign a new product that was in the works that failed
[40:24.000 --> 40:28.000]  somehow, I think there's some kind of complicated story like that where
[40:28.000 --> 40:32.000]  they intended to have updated hardware and something happened
[40:32.000 --> 40:36.000]  behind the scenes that kept them from releasing it.
[40:36.000 --> 40:40.000]  They were expecting X, Y, and Z from Intel in 2016
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.000]  and Intel failed to deliver and it left them holding
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.000]  the bag because they didn't have a plan B. I don't know, something like that.
[40:48.000 --> 40:52.000]  But with the airport base stations, it doesn't make any sense to me why they couldn't have
[40:52.000 --> 40:56.000]  an updated product if they wanted to.
[40:56.000 --> 41:00.000]  Well, and what's strange is that when
[41:00.000 --> 41:04.000]  we, I don't know, what was it, like three weeks ago or a month ago, they
[41:04.000 --> 41:08.000]  released the first update, software update for it in
[41:08.000 --> 41:12.000]  God knows how long. For what? For the airport base
[41:12.000 --> 41:16.000]  station. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, just
[41:16.000 --> 41:20.000]  I don't know. I agree with you. I do.
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.000]  See,
[41:24.000 --> 41:28.000]  you say that there's other products out there that are faster.
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.000]  There are other products out there that are just as easy to use.
[41:32.000 --> 41:36.000]  And I haven't tried any of those. I
[41:36.000 --> 41:40.000]  still have two airport base
[41:40.000 --> 41:44.000]  stations, one time capsule
[41:44.000 --> 41:48.000]  and one regular. And that's what I use.
[41:48.000 --> 41:52.000]  You know, so I haven't had the need to try any of the others.
[41:52.000 --> 41:56.000]  So for me, everything works fine.
[41:56.000 --> 42:00.000]  If I could get more speed, then that would be great.
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.000]  I would love that. And if Apple is not going to
[42:04.000 --> 42:08.000]  keep up with it. I mean, the thing
[42:08.000 --> 42:12.000]  that we love the most about Apple products, I think, is
[42:12.000 --> 42:16.000]  the integration or one of the things. You know, everything just kind of works
[42:16.000 --> 42:20.000]  together. You know, the automatic backups for
[42:20.000 --> 42:24.000]  Time Machine and you get one of these
[42:24.000 --> 42:28.000]  airports and everything just works. Everything talks
[42:28.000 --> 42:32.000]  to each other. It's great. And I love that. I love not
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.000]  having to think about all the things that
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.000]  Apple does for us.
[42:40.000 --> 42:44.000]  Well, it doesn't always just work, which is another topic of conversation.
[42:44.000 --> 42:48.000]  But sometimes it does, and when it does, it's easy to forget just how cool it is.
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.000]  One of the ones that works for me now, and I hadn't
[42:52.000 --> 42:56.000]  actually tried it for a while because my iCloud account was
[42:56.000 --> 43:00.000]  I don't know, I couldn't turn two-factor authentication on.
[43:00.000 --> 43:04.000]  It's very confusing. There was an older thing that they had
[43:04.000 --> 43:08.000]  that wasn't called two-factor. It was like two-form
[43:08.000 --> 43:12.000]  identification. And it did send things to my
[43:12.000 --> 43:16.000]  iPhone. I had that turned on. But when you have that turned on,
[43:16.000 --> 43:20.000]  you have to turn it off before you could switch to the real two-factor. And then when I did
[43:20.000 --> 43:24.000]  that, my iCloud account just didn't give me the option
[43:24.000 --> 43:28.000]  to turn on two-factor. But without two-factor authentication on your
[43:28.000 --> 43:32.000]  iCloud, you can't use, this is what I'm getting to, you can't use the new
[43:32.000 --> 43:36.000]  unlock your Mac with your Apple Watch feature.
[43:36.000 --> 43:40.000]  So anyway, I got that straightened out somehow.
[43:40.000 --> 43:44.000]  And I turned two-factor on my iCloud account, and I've
[43:44.000 --> 43:48.000]  got a watch here running watchOS 3.1
[43:48.000 --> 43:52.000]  and the unlock your Mac with the watch thing is amazing.
[43:52.000 --> 43:56.000]  It's absolutely amazing.
[43:56.000 --> 44:00.000]  I can't believe, and it works
[44:00.000 --> 44:04.000]  really well. And I know that it's one of those things, I think it was
[44:04.000 --> 44:08.000]  macOS, the 10.12.2 update,
[44:08.000 --> 44:12.000]  the same update where they took out the
[44:12.000 --> 44:16.000]  time remaining for the battery thing. The same update, one of
[44:16.000 --> 44:20.000]  the other features that was a bullet point, like, hey, here's what we've got
[44:20.000 --> 44:24.000]  in this minor update to macOS 10,
[44:24.000 --> 44:28.000]  I guess I just call it macOS now, Sierra, was that
[44:28.000 --> 44:32.000]  they made the unlock with your watch a lot faster.
[44:32.000 --> 44:36.000]  Now, I didn't use it before that,
[44:36.000 --> 44:40.000]  though, so I don't know what the speed was, but the speed now is amazing.
[44:40.000 --> 44:44.000]  It tells you, as you wake up your Mac, it's like unlocking with Apple Watch.
[44:44.000 --> 44:48.000]  And in way less time than it would take me to enter my
[44:48.000 --> 44:52.000]  password, I'm in. And part of the
[44:52.000 --> 44:56.000]  thing that they fixed with that is even the language
[44:56.000 --> 45:00.000]  to set it up. Because before they didn't really
[45:00.000 --> 45:04.000]  explain to you what was going on, and if
[45:04.000 --> 45:08.000]  something went wrong, then it just kind of went wrong.
[45:08.000 --> 45:12.000]  And
[45:12.000 --> 45:16.000]  I was very fortunate that I had, well,
[45:16.000 --> 45:20.000]  I set up a couple that went perfectly fine,
[45:20.000 --> 45:24.000]  and then I set up one that just would not
[45:24.000 --> 45:28.000]  work, and I couldn't figure out why it wouldn't work. So
[45:28.000 --> 45:32.000]  now the language is better, they're being
[45:32.000 --> 45:36.000]  a bit more interactive in what they're doing, so all of that helps.
[45:36.000 --> 45:40.000]  You know, I really like
[45:40.000 --> 45:44.000]  the unlock with Apple Watch, because I work
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.000]  a lot on my laptop.
[45:48.000 --> 45:52.000]  Right now I'm using a MacBook Pro, and I work on
[45:52.000 --> 45:56.000]  that a lot. So whenever I walk up to it, it just
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.000]  unlocks. And I don't know about you, but I'll get up and go
[46:00.000 --> 46:04.000]  grab a coffee, or get on the phone, or
[46:04.000 --> 46:08.000]  just take a little walk, and then when I come back it's locked.
[46:08.000 --> 46:12.000]  And it's not a big deal,
[46:12.000 --> 46:16.000]  honestly, to type in your password, it's just more efficient not to.
[46:16.000 --> 46:20.000]  If your Apple Watch is connected.
[46:20.000 --> 46:24.000]  Again, that integration and the things that
[46:24.000 --> 46:28.000]  Apple saves, the efficiency,
[46:28.000 --> 46:32.000]  to me is a big deal.
[46:32.000 --> 46:36.000]  Well, let's circle back to the Mac Pro.
[46:36.000 --> 46:40.000]  People look at this, and
[46:40.000 --> 46:44.000]  I think we're maybe... I understand, I
[46:44.000 --> 46:48.000]  said it was almost like a form of paranoia, and I think it's because
[46:48.000 --> 46:52.000]  I think people recognize that if you prefer a
[46:52.000 --> 46:56.000]  desktop-style interface,
[46:56.000 --> 47:00.000]  meaning a keyboard and a mouse and windows that are
[47:00.000 --> 47:04.000]  stacked on the screen, and you know, you could choose
[47:04.000 --> 47:08.000]  Mac, you could choose Windows, and then on the open source side
[47:08.000 --> 47:12.000]  there's a bunch of Linux variants. I linked to a guy this week
[47:12.000 --> 47:16.000]  who tried like ten of them. Did you see that? Where he tried like ten different,
[47:16.000 --> 47:20.000]  because he's trying to prepare for what happens if Mac OS goes away.
[47:20.000 --> 47:24.000]  Or at least for his own needs as a Ruby developer.
[47:24.000 --> 47:28.000]  And I think what people who really love
[47:28.000 --> 47:32.000]  and get the Mac understand is that there's
[47:32.000 --> 47:36.000]  nothing, the other ones are nothing like the Mac.
[47:36.000 --> 47:40.000]  I don't know. Honest to God, I think I'd just stop working if I had to use
[47:40.000 --> 47:44.000]  Windows. I don't know. I'd become like a
[47:44.000 --> 47:48.000]  lumberjack or something.
[47:48.000 --> 47:52.000]  I'm not cut out for physical labor. I'd have to find something else.
[47:52.000 --> 47:56.000]  I don't know.
[47:56.000 --> 48:00.000]  I'd become a podcaster and just record on tapes.
[48:00.000 --> 48:04.000]  I would find it.
[48:04.000 --> 48:08.000]  The Mac OS is amazing.
[48:08.000 --> 48:12.000]  It's so good in so many
[48:12.000 --> 48:16.000]  ways for a power user. And it doesn't mean, and I realize, and I think the fear
[48:16.000 --> 48:20.000]  that people see is that iOS
[48:20.000 --> 48:24.000]  sells way more devices, especially phones, but iPads
[48:24.000 --> 48:28.000]  however much iPads have declined in sales
[48:28.000 --> 48:32.000]  from their peak, they still outsell the Mac. And there
[48:32.000 --> 48:36.000]  are a lot of people, for a lot of people, the iPad can be
[48:36.000 --> 48:40.000]  a great main computer. And people see that.
[48:40.000 --> 48:44.000]  And it gives them the fear that Apple's going to
[48:44.000 --> 48:48.000]  say, why waste time on the Mac? Much like
[48:48.000 --> 48:52.000]  why waste time updating airport base stations when iOS is where it's at
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.000]  and we'll just make everybody move to iOS.
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.000]  I don't think that's reasonable. I don't think that's the case.
[49:00.000 --> 49:04.000]  But I think I'm loosely articulating the fear that's out there.
[49:04.000 --> 49:08.000]  Clearly. I mean, you can't deny that there are people who are worried
[49:08.000 --> 49:12.000]  about this, right? Oh, of course. Yes, absolutely. I mean, it is one of the
[49:12.000 --> 49:16.000]  main topics of conversation of Mac power users
[49:16.000 --> 49:20.000]  right now. And let's just
[49:20.000 --> 49:24.000]  put it out there. There's proof that something is wrong
[49:24.000 --> 49:28.000]  insofar as the Mac Pro is 1,100 days
[49:28.000 --> 49:32.000]  old and hasn't been updated. I mean, that is a fact. That's
[49:32.000 --> 49:36.000]  unarguable. Yeah, you can't argue the facts
[49:36.000 --> 49:40.000]  that are out there. But
[49:40.000 --> 49:44.000]  is there, we're very
[49:44.000 --> 49:48.000]  quick to believe, and in some cases we know
[49:48.000 --> 49:52.000]  that Apple has prototypes of
[49:52.000 --> 49:56.000]  different products.
[49:56.000 --> 50:00.000]  They're actively working on new products
[50:00.000 --> 50:04.000]  and they have those prototypes. But for some reason
[50:04.000 --> 50:08.000]  we refuse to believe that they're working on new Macs.
[50:08.000 --> 50:12.000]  And is that
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.000]  our problem or is it Apple's problem? I think it's partly Apple's
[50:16.000 --> 50:20.000]  problem because they haven't updated the damn thing. I think that
[50:20.000 --> 50:24.000]  one of the problems is a misconception among people who I think
[50:24.000 --> 50:28.000]  should even know better that they see Apple as almost omnipotent.
[50:28.000 --> 50:32.000]  What I think
[50:32.000 --> 50:36.000]  is the case is that something has gone horribly wrong. This is not their
[50:36.000 --> 50:40.000]  plan. Apple never planned to go three years without an update to this
[50:40.000 --> 50:44.000]  and that something behind the scenes or maybe multiple things
[50:44.000 --> 50:48.000]  like a domino effect of one thing leading to another
[50:48.000 --> 50:52.000]  has left them and that they are inside
[50:52.000 --> 50:56.000]  Apple terribly embarrassed. And there are people who
[50:56.000 --> 51:00.000]  up the chain who are angry, but
[51:00.000 --> 51:04.000]  because it's Apple and Apple keep their mouths shut
[51:04.000 --> 51:08.000]  the story doesn't leak. And so from the outside it just looks
[51:08.000 --> 51:12.000]  like
[51:12.000 --> 51:16.000]  a disastrous
[51:16.000 --> 51:20.000]  development process for either an updated Mac Pro similar to
[51:20.000 --> 51:24.000]  the one that they unveiled three years ago or
[51:24.000 --> 51:28.000]  an all new Mac Pro that is a totally new design
[51:28.000 --> 51:32.000]  because the reason that this one went without an update was there were various things
[51:32.000 --> 51:36.000]  that were wrong with it from Apple's perspective. One way or the other
[51:36.000 --> 51:40.000]  that those development projects went so wrong that they're delayed
[51:40.000 --> 51:44.000]  by years. Is that possible? I think there's a lot of people out there who think
[51:44.000 --> 51:48.000]  that Apple has so many resources and is so wealthy
[51:48.000 --> 51:52.000]  and good at this stuff that that couldn't be the case
[51:52.000 --> 51:56.000]  and therefore Apple has willfully and purposefully
[51:56.000 --> 52:00.000]  put the Mac Pro in the state that it's in. I think there's a lot of people who think that
[52:00.000 --> 52:04.000]  and I think they're wrong. I think Apple could, I think they push
[52:04.000 --> 52:08.000]  the boundaries so hard that they fail all the time and we just don't know it.
[52:08.000 --> 52:12.000]  Well yeah, I agree with that wholeheartedly. But if something like
[52:12.000 --> 52:16.000]  if what you're describing is true then it would have to
[52:16.000 --> 52:20.000]  be something outside of Apple's control. But
[52:20.000 --> 52:24.000]  we've seen... I don't know though. I don't even think it could be
[52:24.000 --> 52:28.000]  like just think back and I know it seems like ancient history but think back to the Mac Cube
[52:28.000 --> 52:32.000]  in 2002. I love the Cube. I still have a Cube. I wish
[52:32.000 --> 52:36.000]  that I wanted one. I coveted one desperately because it seemed like a perfect
[52:36.000 --> 52:40.000]  computer for me but it was outside my budget. I loved it. But with those
[52:40.000 --> 52:44.000]  like the fine cracks that were in it. That was out
[52:44.000 --> 52:48.000]  that was within their control. It's things like that like
[52:48.000 --> 52:52.000]  remember, to me the best example that things can go terribly
[52:52.000 --> 52:56.000]  wrong for Apple proof is the white iPhone
[52:56.000 --> 53:00.000]  4. Oh yeah, with the camera.
[53:00.000 --> 53:04.000]  And the first iPhone 4, this was the last
[53:04.000 --> 53:08.000]  iPhone that was released at the June time frame. The
[53:08.000 --> 53:12.000]  4S I think was the one that moved to September.
[53:12.000 --> 53:16.000]  So they announced it at WWDC and it's a radical
[53:16.000 --> 53:20.000]  new design. It's got a glass back. It
[53:20.000 --> 53:24.000]  really was just a great improvement.
[53:24.000 --> 53:28.000]  It's the first one that went retina.
[53:28.000 --> 53:32.000]  The 3GS was sort of like the cheapest looking iPhone that they ever made.
[53:32.000 --> 53:36.000]  The 3G, 3GS with the plastic back. So it's like a premium upgrade
[53:36.000 --> 53:40.000]  in materials. It's
[53:40.000 --> 53:44.000]  just great in so many ways. And they say it's available in black and white.
[53:44.000 --> 53:48.000]  And the black one comes out at like the end of June or first week of July. And then they
[53:48.000 --> 53:52.000]  say well there's a couple of weeks on the white one. And it's like a couple of weeks. And then it ends up
[53:52.000 --> 53:56.000]  the thing doesn't ship until like May of the next year, right?
[53:56.000 --> 54:00.000]  I mean it was so close. It was close to when people were anticipating the next iPhone
[54:00.000 --> 54:04.000]  would come out. Even though it didn't come out in June. But that meant people
[54:04.000 --> 54:08.000]  you know, it was almost a full year late
[54:08.000 --> 54:12.000]  of a product that they announced. And they've mumbled something about
[54:12.000 --> 54:16.000]  manufacturing process. They never really...
[54:16.000 --> 54:20.000]  They don't want to explain what went wrong.
[54:20.000 --> 54:24.000]  I don't remember. I think it was something with... Because it was the same
[54:24.000 --> 54:28.000]  camera as black, right? Or was it that the white interfered with the camera?
[54:28.000 --> 54:32.000]  Right. I seem to remember that that was when
[54:32.000 --> 54:36.000]  you took a picture, the white
[54:36.000 --> 54:40.000]  didn't interfere with how the picture turned out.
[54:40.000 --> 54:44.000]  And it was, you know, as far as I understand, it was like
[54:44.000 --> 54:48.000]  if everything went perfectly in the manufacturing of the white back
[54:48.000 --> 54:52.000]  thing, it was fine. It's just that when they started trying to
[54:52.000 --> 54:56.000]  pump millions of them out, you know, at the full production rate, some of them, too many of
[54:56.000 --> 55:00.000]  them like had this flaw where, right, like too much light got in and it ruined
[55:00.000 --> 55:04.000]  the thing. Because I remember
[55:04.000 --> 55:08.000]  it was bizarre. It was like when the antenna gate... Were you there for the antenna gate
[55:08.000 --> 55:12.000]  press? I couldn't make it. It was on short
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.000]  notice. I couldn't make it. Literally, same day. I mean, I remember whatever day it was, they
[55:16.000 --> 55:20.000]  called me and they were like, it's tomorrow morning. So I was like,
[55:20.000 --> 55:24.000]  I think it's the only time I've ever done this. I
[55:24.000 --> 55:28.000]  got the phone call at like two o'clock Eastern time here
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.000]  and found a four o'clock flight to SFO.
[55:32.000 --> 55:36.000]  And so like, I was like,
[55:36.000 --> 55:40.000]  I booked it. It wasn't ungodly expensive, but you know,
[55:40.000 --> 55:44.000]  booking a flight that leaves in two hours is kind of expensive. And I told
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.000]  Amy, you know, I got to go. Apple's having a thing about this antenna thing tomorrow.
[55:48.000 --> 55:52.000]  I got a flight. And I was like in a cab on the
[55:52.000 --> 55:56.000]  way to the airport about 20 minutes after I'd
[55:56.000 --> 56:00.000]  gotten off the phone with Apple. And you know, it was like the last
[56:00.000 --> 56:04.000]  I mean, I think I had a couple of other choices, but it was the only non-stop that was
[56:04.000 --> 56:08.000]  remaining for the day. But anyway, I remember going there for
[56:08.000 --> 56:12.000]  that meeting and I was in
[56:12.000 --> 56:16.000]  the group of people that got the tour of the antenna facilities. I don't know, it was about 20 of us.
[56:16.000 --> 56:20.000]  And while we were doing that, we're walking between
[56:20.000 --> 56:24.000]  you know, town hall and where they were going to show us these antenna testing rooms.
[56:24.000 --> 56:28.000]  You know, we're there in the middle of the campus. At the events now, they let us
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.000]  you know, they have us go through the middle of Infinite Loops campus. But
[56:32.000 --> 56:36.000]  back then, that was very rare. They'd let you in like
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.000]  they had like one door that you could go in and you were
[56:40.000 --> 56:44.000]  right there in front of town hall and that was it. You know, like you weren't going anywhere.
[56:44.000 --> 56:48.000]  Like now they let us, you know, they have us come in the main door and we get a little
[56:48.000 --> 56:52.000]  walk through the campus. But back in the Katie Cotton days, you didn't
[56:52.000 --> 56:56.000]  get to see anything. But we did to get to this thing. And the thing
[56:56.000 --> 57:00.000]  that I remember was this is just, when was it? It was like August, I think.
[57:00.000 --> 57:04.000]  There were Apple employees walking around with white iPhones.
[57:04.000 --> 57:08.000]  It's a very long story to say.
[57:08.000 --> 57:12.000]  But anyway, the white iPhone 4 is proof that Apple, something can go
[57:12.000 --> 57:16.000]  disastrously wrong between prototype
[57:16.000 --> 57:20.000]  and saying, okay, yes, this is good to go. We're going to make this
[57:20.000 --> 57:24.000]  in mass production and then making it in mass production. Something
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.000]  can go wrong. And I think something like that has gone wrong with the Mac Pro.
[57:28.000 --> 57:32.000]  I have no reason to believe it other than that it makes the most sense to me.
[57:32.000 --> 57:36.000]  No little birdies have told me anything like this, but I definitely think it's possible.
[57:36.000 --> 57:40.000]  And I think the pessimism out there is that there's too many people who
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.000]  think that that couldn't happen to Apple because Apple is too, you know,
[57:44.000 --> 57:48.000]  too rich, too good, too smart.
[57:48.000 --> 57:52.000]  Well, I
[57:52.000 --> 57:56.000]  do you ever see a time, I will not ever,
[57:56.000 --> 58:00.000]  in the next few years that Apple will come out and say
[58:00.000 --> 58:04.000]  we're done with the Mac or we're done with the Pro levels?
[58:04.000 --> 58:08.000]  No, I don't. In fact, I think the Pro levels are the ones that have the biggest
[58:08.000 --> 58:12.000]  future. I think the thing that makes the Mac
[58:12.000 --> 58:16.000]  essential is the Pro level.
[58:16.000 --> 58:20.000]  People often bring up,
[58:20.000 --> 58:24.000]  and I think it's a good point now, but it's just one of many
[58:24.000 --> 58:28.000]  Pro use cases. The one thing, I've seen this argument a lot, that no Apple,
[58:28.000 --> 58:32.000]  the Mac will be around forever because you need a Mac to make
[58:32.000 --> 58:36.000]  iPhone apps. And what
[58:36.000 --> 58:40.000]  could Apple do if they abandon the Mac? How would you make
[58:40.000 --> 58:44.000]  iPhone apps? Well, they could, in theory, port Xcode to Windows
[58:44.000 --> 58:48.000]  and the story would be, okay, if you want to write iPhone apps, you have to use Windows.
[58:48.000 --> 58:52.000]  I mean, technically that could happen, but there is 0% chance
[58:52.000 --> 58:56.000]  that Apple would do that. Zero. Zero.
[58:56.000 --> 59:00.000]  So, let me ask you this. If I say
[59:00.000 --> 59:04.000]  to you right now, John, I want you
[59:04.000 --> 59:08.000]  to write and post this story
[59:08.000 --> 59:12.000]  and hang up and go.
[59:12.000 --> 59:16.000]  Would you go to your Mac or your iPad? Well, I would go to the Mac.
[59:16.000 --> 59:20.000]  I do almost all of my work on the Mac, but I don't dispute the fact that there are
[59:20.000 --> 59:24.000]  people like Federico Vittucci and Ben Brooks who are
[59:24.000 --> 59:28.000]  more productive for them. For different
[59:28.000 --> 59:32.000]  people, iOS could be, I see the appeal of it.
[59:32.000 --> 59:36.000]  I don't deny it. I feel like
[59:36.000 --> 59:40.000]  that's another mistake a lot of Mac proponents, people who love the Mac and want
[59:40.000 --> 59:44.000]  to really do it. There's some people, I see it on Twitter all the time,
[59:44.000 --> 59:48.000]  they say you can't do real work on an iPad.
[59:48.000 --> 59:52.000]  That's wrong. And that the people who do are just sort of
[59:52.000 --> 59:56.000]  dilatants. It's like being a hipster.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000]  Federico and Ben have done some amazing things
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000]  workflow-wise, work-wise, everything on their iPads.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  I use my iPad all the time. I actually use multiple iPads
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000]  all the time. I love the iPad. But
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000]  if I'm going to sit down and do some work,
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  it's going to be on my Mac. Either my iMac
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  or my MacBook Pro. That's
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  what it's going to be for me. And that's what
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  I grew up with, what I did my business with.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  The iPad, the iPhone, all of those things,
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  the big word is the computer in your pocket. That's absolutely
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  true. It is absolutely true. And I never
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  force myself to use
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  an iPad or an iPhone to do, you know, as soon as the new
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  product comes out, people say, oh, I'm going to use this for a month instead of my Mac.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  I don't do stuff like that. I use it how it
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  fits into my workflow. And it does. It fits very well into
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  my workflow. So I have things that I can do with it.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  But the Mac for me is still, I mean
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  when I record and write music, you know, that's on the
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  27 inch iMac. That's a powerful machine. And
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  you know, when the Mac Pro, the MacBook Pro came out
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  I had a Logic project.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  Logic is a, you know, that's a professional level
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  audio workstation. I had 48
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  tracks running simultaneously, audio, midi,
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  recording, and I was editing. I mean, this is
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  all live. And the MacBook Pro had no issue at all
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  with it. It just went right through. So they're all powerful computers
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  these days. Are we at the stage where we actually don't
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  need a Mac Pro? Are the other
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  computers powerful enough for everything that we need to do?
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  I do think that that's a legitimate question. I wish that Apple would
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  keep making Mac Pros and putting the fastest
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  Intel processors they can possibly get, figuring out
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  a very clever engineered way
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  to either reduce the need for a fan or to make the fan
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  as utterly silent as possible. Because it's just one of those things that Apple
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  cares about that I feel like if, you know,
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  you had to use some other company's computers, it's like they make more noise.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  It's like, you know, having a nice quiet computer is important to me.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  And I think it's important to a lot of pros, and I think that's one of, it's just
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  you know, it's why people are Mac users. People are Mac users because they care about the details.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  And like a computer that makes noise makes them angry. Whereas people
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  who don't really care about the details are like, oh yeah, it makes noise like a hairdryer. Who cares?
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  I don't care. I'll put headphones on. And it's like, no,
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  you just spent a lot of money on this computer. It should be silent. So I hope they do.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  But given the evidence that they haven't updated it in three years,
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  you know, it's a legitimate fear that the message
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  is no, the Mac's not dead. We love the Mac. The Mac has a bright future, but the Mac's future
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  is iMacs and MacBooks.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  What do you make of what Tim Cook did after
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  it was Bloomberg, I think, that wrote the story about
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  you know, that the Mac is basically gone.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  And Tim came out in a Q&A.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  Internally. But knowing that it was going to leak.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  Of course. Yeah, they know all of them. Well, what did he say?
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  He said that they had great Macs in the
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  pipeline. Right.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  Yeah, we didn't specify. I think he said great desktops
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  in the pipeline. I think he said that.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  Which is, you know, it could just mean iMacs. It could.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  I mean, people are still pining for
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  new Mac Minis. I think that's over.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  I kind of do too, which is a shame, but it's nowhere near.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  It's clearly the least essential product that Apple makes. And I know that it's painful
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  for the people. Because that's the one thing about it. Is that, yes, I think most people who buy
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  a Mac Mini are just typical Mac users who are on a budget
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  and, or, you know, maybe they already have a display that they don't
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  want to replace. And so, you know, why spend all the money on an iMac
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  with its, you know, gorgeous. And in my opinion, the best, it's still
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  over a year since it's been updated, but I think it's the best display on the market.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  Period. Hands down. It's an unbelievable
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  display. Mine, I have the one from the year before that doesn't
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  have the high color gamut. And I still think it's an amazing, amazing display.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  I love it. I'm looking at it right now.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  But I realize that there are also, and I'm sure that
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  they're listening to the show. I hear from them all the time. I get email from them.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  That there are power users who use the Mac Mini in various ways.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  Maybe it is their main computer, but they have very sensible reasons
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  why they want a Mac Mini. And then there's also the enthusiasts who use Mac Minis
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  as little, you know, like to make their own home entertainment
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  system. You know, instead of getting an Apple TV, they use a Mac Mini
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  and they can run all sorts of stuff and, you know, play movies that have fallen
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  off the bus and, you know, the back of the truck and stuff like that.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  Yeah. And for them, it's a shame because I think,
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000]  you know, making a Hackintosh type thing to do that
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  is never going to be as nice, especially because the Mac Mini, you just want like this small
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000]  silent computer. But I kind of feel like Apple just,
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000]  there's no reason for Apple to really care too much about that.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000]  I'd love to see it updated, like even just like a small speed bump, but
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000]  I don't know. Here's what Tim said. Some folks in the media
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000]  have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear. We have great
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000]  Right. Here's something about that. Now I've seen people,
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  skepticism is a good thing, right? I encourage it.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  And I think everybody should be skeptical
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  about anything that somebody who works at a company can say,
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000]  including the CEO, right? And of course, Tim Cook, it's in his interest to say good things
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  about Apple. So of course, you know, don't
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  just assume that it's true. But I don't, one of the things about what he said is
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  it, again, it doesn't say anything about the Mac Pro. So it could mean that the future of
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  the desktop Mac is iMacs, you know? And I could see them going that route
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  and saying, hey, and at the high end, we've got this iMac,
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  you know, they call it the iMac Pro, you know, maybe it's all black instead of silver.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  And the iMac Pro comes with, you know, a faster set of
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  Intel chips than you could get previously and a professional
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  GPU. That's
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  possible. I don't know how, you know, in the current form factor, if that could be cooled
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000]  sufficiently, I don't know. But that's up to, you know, Apple comes up with clever ways to cool things.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  So I don't know. I could see that being the story for pro users. And I know
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  that that would be frustrating for people who don't want a built-in display. They
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  just, you know, want, you know, standalone displays, et cetera, et cetera. But I could see that being
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  the story. But there's no way, the thing about Tim Cook's statement is that there's
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  his credibility to his own employees matters. And if it's
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  false, right, you know, like, I've seen, I saw
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  people on Twitter when I came in, Tim Cook's full of shit, of course he'd say that. If there are
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  no desktops coming, it's not like people who worked at
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  Apple are going to forget that Tim Cook said, you know, literally
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000]  said you have no reason to worry about that. His credibility
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  goes right down the toilet, right? Like, that's a permanent
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  mark against his credibility. How do you, how do you
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  reconcile that with the fact that Steve would say things all the
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  time and then turn around and do the opposite? You know, we're not going to have a smaller iPad.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000]  Here's the iPad mini.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  Well, but this was
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  it was, when Steve would say things
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  that, and then a year later turn around and say the opposite, and
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  it was never like, it was never a thing where you feel like you
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  were burned. So here's a good example, right?
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  They come out with, they call it the iPod Photos, right? Wasn't that the name of the product? It was
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  the first iPod with a color display, and you could sync it to your iPhotos
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  and you'd get your photos on there. And then people
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  immediately after the product was announced, they'd say, well, now that you have a color
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  screen, why doesn't it play video? And Steve Jobs said, nobody wants to watch video
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  on a little two-inch screen. Now why would they want to look at their photos on a two-inch
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  screen but not watch video? I don't know. But that's what he said. Nobody wants to watch video
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  on a two-inch screen. And then a year later, they came out with an iPod with
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  the same size screen and now it played videos.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  People aren't mad because now they have
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  if what you wanted was an iPod that plays videos, the fact that a year
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  later he told a totally different story didn't make you mad, it made you happy
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  because now you could buy an iPod that played videos. The difference would be if
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  Steve Jobs said before it came out,
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  people are asking for an iPod that plays videos,
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  let me assure you, we are working on it and it's going to be awesome.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  It's in the pipeline, so don't worry about it. It's going to be great. You're going to be able to watch video
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  right from your pocket. And then it never shipped. Well, then that would make people
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  angry. That's what the case would be with the new desktops with
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  Tim Cook and his credibility.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  Again, it's not like he isn't capable
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  of spin, but when he does, it's not
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  very, very carefully worded and it's not bullshit.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  It's definitely spin sometimes, but it's not
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  bullshit. Well, to be clear, I trust Tim.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  I don't believe that Tim would come out and say what
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  he said if it wasn't true. Right, I agree.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  Even if it's not that you trust him personally, and I
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  do, but even if you just want to take your own personal
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  opinions of him out, it just makes no sense for him to
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  say what he said if it wasn't true. No, he can just do what they do
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  most of the time and just let it roll.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  Here's an example where I think Tim Cook spins and says something that I don't
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  quite think is true. I think that his
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  stance on privacy and where Apple stands
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  competitively with Google in particular, but other companies like Facebook,
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  is to me a little self-serving in so far as
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  that he'll say that other companies
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  collect your personal data so that they can sell it. It's not really what Google does.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  They don't really sell your personal data.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  What he says isn't really untrue, it's not false, it's not
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  a blatant lie, but I think it's a very euphemistic
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  spin on the state of affairs to
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  cover up for the state of Apple's
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  personalization in certain
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  areas.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  I'm just saying, it's a sidetrack. I just think that what he
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  says about privacy, and I do think Apple cares about your privacy, right?
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  It's largely true. I think Apple does care about your privacy. I think Google
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  cares about your privacy too in so far as it's very important that Google's
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  users and people who are the most embedded in their ecosystem
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  trust the company with their information. It is in
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000]  Google's very highest interest to keep the information
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  they collect about you safe.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  I think that's part of it, though, that Google collects so much
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  information, and Apple really collects none.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  They anonymize almost everything, so they don't
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  want your information, they want, and you know, the
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  old saying, if you didn't buy the product, you are the product.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  Well, again, I believe that. I've used that.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  You can find a bunch of posts on During Fireball where I've used
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  that, but I do think that sometimes when Tim Cook throws it out there, it's
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  spin, and it's not, again, not false, it's not bullshit, but
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  it is a decidedly and carefully worded
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  way of saying things in Apple's favor that maybe isn't really the
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  most objective way of saying it, period. I don't see that at all with his comments
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  on the desktop, right? That's the only reason I'm going down this whole path on
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  Cook and privacy, is that I think that is spin. I think with the
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  desktop, there's no spin. He looks like a fool if it's not true.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  Oh, yeah, absolutely. I don't see that at all. I mean,
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  they saw this Bloomberg story and
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  knew that they had to respond in some
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  way, or they wanted to respond in some way, so I think it was
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  very strong response.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  I also, and I keep reiterating this, I think that the
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  software schedule that Mac OS is on is proof the other way,
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  that Apple is very, very
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  heavily invested in the Mac and cares about it, because
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  it's annual, it's like clockwork now, just like
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  iOS, that there's going to be a significant feature update to
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  Mac OS every year, and it didn't used to be that way.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  It was like the early years of Mac OS, there were very frequent
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  updates. 10.1 came out like six months after 10.0, because
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  10.0 was effectively a public beta. They were just sick of calling it
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  a beta. And 10.2 and 10.3, I think even
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  10.4 came out really quickly, because there were so many problems back
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  then, and it was just so slow. The interface was slow.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  They were doing so much compared to what the hardware was capable of that they
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  really had to work very hard to get it to
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  I think 10.4 was the first version. I think that was called Tiger. That was sort of like,
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  yeah, this is actually pretty good. And then it slowed down,
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  right? And especially when the iPhone first came out, and they even, one time even
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  had to issue a press release that said, hey, we were going to release Mac OS 10 point, whatever
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  it was, at WWDC in June 2007,
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  but we've had to pull so many engineers to work on the first release of
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  iPhone's OS that it's going to be delayed until October.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  You remember in the years following that,
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  it was a crapshoot about what
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  Apple was going to do at WWDC. Was it going to be a Mac show or an
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  iOS show? And then finally,
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  a few years ago, they, I don't know
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  if they have enough resources or it's running
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  parallel, but now it's both. Now when you go
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  to WWDC, it's both Mac and iOS because they're
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  integrating and stuff like that, but for a while it wasn't. It was one or the other.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  So anyway, long story short, I think the Mac OS story shows
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  that Apple's committed. I think the Touch Bar as a
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  piece of hardware is a terrific example of Apple's commitment
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  to the Mac. I think the fact that the day the Touch Bar shipped,
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  Apple's own apps, dozens and
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  dozens of apps in the system had updates with
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  very, very thorough Touch Bar support.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  Clearly throughout the company, people who work on those apps,
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  text edit and mail, Safari messages, you name it,
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  the engineers who work on those had
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000]  spent a lot of time working on clever, thoughtful Touch Bar support.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  It shows that within Apple there's a lot of commitment to the Mac. I think the question
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000]  is specifically the Mac Pro, and I don't think that even if Apple
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  is getting out of the Mac Pro game, I don't think it means that
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  the Mac overall, that people need to worry about it. I think people are losing their minds
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  on this. Yeah, I agree. Although, if they are getting
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000]  out of the Mac Pro game, it makes no sense to me that they're still selling these Mac
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  Mac Pros at the same price. That they should, the way that if they were getting out of the
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000]  Mac Pro game, the way that it would make sense to me would be if, alright, we're not going to update
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  them, but every 9 months, 12 months or so, we'll keep
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  lowering the prices until we decide, you know, 2, 3, whatever
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  that we'll just take them away. Do you think they're selling any?
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  I can't imagine that they're selling any. Well, did you see there was a good, I had a link to Chris
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  Adamson just bought one last week. Huh. I'll put
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  it, link in the show notes. It's sort of a sad story really, like where he
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000]  obviously was waiting and waiting and waiting to update his old Mac Pro, and he does
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  video work.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  And I know on ATP, Marco Arment
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  who stays much more abreast of
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  like Intel's chips and what the names of the
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  chips, I don't even pay attention to that shit anymore to tell you the truth, because it's so boring. I did
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000]  see an R's story where they reviewed the new Kaby Lake whatever from
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000]  Intel, and the gist of the R summary was, it's pretty much like the last
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000]  one, just ever so slightly faster. I mean, and so it's like, why even bother
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000]  paying attention? It's not that interesting, but
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  the gist of it is he bought it, I think maybe
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000]  he might have been better off with an iMac, and that's what Marco thinks too, but
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  he didn't. He bought the Mac Pro, I guess because what
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  he does is, it requires a lot of cores, and he does, you know, the
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  video processing it does can be parallelized, but he didn't even buy like
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  the 8 or 12 core one, he bought the 6 core one, so he didn't even get the most cores.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  But anyway, long story short, spoiler, he
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  spent a lot of money on a new Mac Pro because he needed it and he thinks it was the best thing to do
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.000]  and he's, you know, eyes wide open about how old this is and how much money it costs
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000]  and then he sold all of his Apple stock, and he apparently had a very, very
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  significant investment in Apple stock and sold it because he's so
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.000]  not like angry, not like, you know, like he thinks he's sticking it
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  to Apple by selling his stock. It obviously doesn't hurt Apple if you one
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000]  individual sells your Apple stock because somebody else bought it.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  It more though that he, you know, I think his argument
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  was, I bought it way back when, and he apparently bought it, you know, in the dark days
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  when you could really get a, you know, the stock was way down compared to where it is now,
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  bought it because he believed in the company and thought that the market
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000]  was undervaluing Apple, and I think, you know, easy to
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000]  say, yeah, he was right, and anybody else who did buy stock, you know, like in the late 90s
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  or early 2000s thinking, hey, this company has a bright future, and I
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  don't think the market sees that, you were right, and he just doesn't see it anymore because
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  he doesn't get Apple anymore. And I definitely,
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  just, you know, on Twitter, there's an awful lot of people, and I think that they're drawing a connection
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  that the people who are most disappointed in Apple today are the
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  longest term oldest users, the ones who got into it
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  company in the 90s or even the 80s.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  I think that
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000]  a lot of that comes down to loyalty.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.000]  We have loyalty to Apple
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.000]  because we believe that they make great products.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.000]  I mean, I'm not blind to Apple's failings,
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.000]  and I'll bring them up, you know, all day long,
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.000]  but I'm not going to make up bad things either.
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.000]  You know, Apple Music, I think, needs a lot of work.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000]  I know that they're working on it,
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  and I praise them when they do good things,
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000]  but I also hit them when they do bad things.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  And it's the same with all of their products, and
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  as long as you're fair, I think that's a good thing.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.000]  But the difference with the new Apple customers
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000]  is that
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.000]  in my mind, they're general consumers.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  So if something new and cool comes out,
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000]  they'll go buy that, whether it's Apple or whatever.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000]  So there's not that level of loyalty.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000]  Before we move off the topic of Mac Pros,
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000]  I want to circle back to that thing I touched on with Xcode.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  Don't rest your hat on Xcode, because there's
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000]  all sorts of professional things that are better on the Mac than
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  iOS, right? And I think that you will,
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000]  sooner rather than later, be able to develop apps on an iPad.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.000]  I mean, I think that the Swift Playgrounds is just the first step.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000]  I'm not saying it's coming this year, but I think that
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  and whether they'll call it Xcode or not when it comes out for
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000]  iPad, I don't know. Because I don't think it would be...Xcode
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000]  as we know it is inextricably tied to the Mac UI
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  paradigm. It's got all sorts of little tiny things
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  that don't correlate to touch or iOS. So I think
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000]  maybe the way that you develop apps would be very different
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  from, or significantly different from the way you do it now.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000]  So whether they call it Xcode or not. But I think that the ability
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000]  to develop apps on an iPad is inevitable.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  And it doesn't...the fear I have is that they'll announce this
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000]  like, hey, we have this great new Xcode for iPad, and look, it's so much easier to
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  it's easier than ever to make an app, blah, blah, blah.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000]  And then people are going to go, that's it, the Mac is doomed. Because now there's Xcode on
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  iPad. And that's the wrong way to look at it. It's just that there's so many professional
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000]  things, whether it's like high end, the highest end 4K video editing
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  and...or pro photographers
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000]  who go on a shoot and shoot 1500 or 2000
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.000]  photos and need to sort through them and find the pics.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000]  All sorts of advanced things like that are so much better, or
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  can be so much better on a Mac. And the other thing too is
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000]  don't forget that Apple itself is a company full of creative
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000]  people. Not just developers, it's not just Apple's engineers who use Xcode who need
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.000]  Macs, but Apple is a company full of people who use Photoshop and
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  InDesign and just produce all their marketing
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.000]  materials and stuff. So they're fully well aware of how creative professionals
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  rely on the Mac.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  You have to at that point look at
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000]  Aperture gone.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000]  A Final Cut Pro. Not gone, but
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  I think they're still invested in that.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  A lot of people say it's not as pro as what it once was.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000]  Logic is still here, but you don't often hear
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  from them anymore.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000]  Aperture is definitely a curious
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  why. And I know that Lightroom exists, and I personally preferred Lightroom
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000]  but that was because way back in the day when they were both 1.0s, Lightroom was fast
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000]  and Aperture was slow. And I know that they fixed that with Aperture
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  and Aperture eventually got fast too.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  I get so much email
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  it's great, and I really welcome it. It helps me keep my
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  finger on the pulse of the people who listen to the show and read my site.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  I know that there are a lot of serious
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  either photo pros or serious photo prosumers.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  Maybe that's not their profession, but they have
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  serious professional cameras and they take it very seriously who
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.000]  are still furious about the decision to
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  walk away from Aperture. And fully informed and have tried
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.000]  their best to like Lightroom, don't like Lightroom, and like the Aperture way.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  And I do say I liked Lightroom, but I
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.000]  definitely could see how Aperture was a more Apple-y program. It just had, you know, because
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  it was Apple, but it just had like a certain Apple-iness and a
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000]  Mac-ness to it. With some of these things that have
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.000]  happened over the past number of years, it's easy to see
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  how people are
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  they have the thought or can be
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  easily convinced that Apple is getting out of the
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  pro market. All markets, whether that's computers or
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  software or anything else. Because once you've been hit by this, I mean if you're
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000]  a photographer and Aperture is dead
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  then you're thinking, wait a minute, it's been a thousand days now
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  since the Mac Pro's been updated. It's easy to
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000]  lead yourself down that path that, okay, Apple's out of
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.000]  the pro market. Well, but the most important thing has always been
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  not for Apple to make the pro apps that you use, but to make the system where pro
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  apps can really fly and have all of the
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  APIs and capabilities and the performance that pro apps need.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:08.000]  Whether they're made by Adobe or other companies, you know,
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  independent companies like Pixelmator and stuff like that.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  Anyway, let me take a break and thank our next
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  sponsor, it's our good friend Harry's. Who better with Jim Dalrymple
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  who literally goes by the nickname The Beard than a razor blade company to sponsor the show.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  Big blade, here's Harry, you guys know Harry's.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  They make their own razor blades. They have their
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  own factory in Germany. There was a link, I'm going to try to find this, there's a link
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  I had to somebody went to their razor blade factory and took pictures of it and it's amazing.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  I love factories, sometimes like a big place like that. How do you make
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  stuff like that? They make their own. Unlike the other
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  guys, the Gillette's and those guys, they come out with new blades every
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  couple years, new things, and they keep raising the prices. They'll come out with a new
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  thing and it's a better way to shave, but then they raise the price. Well, Harry's has
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  upgraded their stuff. They've come out with a new design.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  They've added a little trimmer blade so it's easy to reach
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  the little place under your nose where it's hard to get with the full-size blade. They've added a better lubricating
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  strip. A softer flex hinge for a more
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000]  comfortable glide. It just improved their blades in a whole bunch of ways
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  and guess what? They kept the prices exactly the same. Instead of raising the price and keeping
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.000]  the old ones and having a new model line, all they did was improve it and they kept the prices the
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  same. It's still just two bucks per blade compared to the four dollars or more
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  that you will pay for the big name brands. I've done this.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  I've done it a couple times. You go to Amazon and compare the competitive price for a
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.000]  Gillette or Schick or whoever else you want. Really, it's about twice
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  the price of Harry's blades because they own their own factory and sell their stuff
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  direct to you. Here's how confident they are.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000]  They're so confident in the quality of their blades that they will send you their popular free trial
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  set which comes with a Razer 5 blade cartridge and shaving gel. Free
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000]  when you sign up for a shave plan. You just pay shipping. Shave plan means
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  you sign up and you get this kit free and then they'll just send you replacement
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000]  blades. You tell them how often you think you need them and then they just show up.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  You don't have to do anything. You don't even have to remember to order new stuff.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  They also have a special offer for fans of this show. It's a special talk show
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  only offer. You'll get a bottle of Harry's Post Shave Bomb
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  added to your order for free when you visit harrys.com
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  and use the code talk show at checkout. Get their Post Shave

[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  My thanks to them. Great, great products. Great company. My thanks
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  for their continuing support of the show.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  It's funny. The two sponsors that you've had so far are two things that I already use.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  Yeah, what do you use Harry's for? Like shave underneath the beard? Like the neck
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  area or something like that? No, no. I leave that alone. Just on the sides.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.000]  The cheeks. Yeah, gotcha.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000]  I don't want to be a total homeless guy.
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000]  You know.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000]  Anyway, what do you think? Let's just flash forward a little bit. Here we are talking the first week of January.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000]  Do you think that Apple's going to have a March event?
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000]  They've had March events now for a couple of years.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  Well, the March event would be what? A watch or iPad? I don't think
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  watch. I think it would be iPad and maybe like iMac.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  Or wouldn't it be neat if they surprised us and had Mac Pro?
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000]  That would be neat. I think the iPads
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000]  are due because they did the original iPad Pro, the big 12.9 inch one
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  in September last year to 2015.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.000]  So that product is now over a year
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.000]  old. And then the mini Mac iPad Pro.
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000]  Did I say Mac Pro? I meant iPad Pro. The 12.9 inch iPad Pro.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000]  The 9.7 inch iPad Pro was released
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.000]  five months later in March of last year. So that'll be a year old in March.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:12.000]  And I think both of those products
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.000]  would be easy upgrades with the A10
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.000]  system on a chip from the iPhone 7.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.000]  Yeah, I guess if
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000]  they seem to be all over the place with the release schedule of
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.000]  these things, but it makes sense that they would have
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000]  something around March. But I think
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.000]  it'll have a lot to do with what they have on tap
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.000]  for WDC. Because it would make more sense to release
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.000]  Macs at WDC. But if they don't
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000]  have any Macs, maybe they'll release iPads instead.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:56.000]  Yeah, I don't know that they care about holding hardware for WDC.
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.000]  There's always plenty of software to talk about, right?
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000]  But they're not going to have, they always like to have something, and they're not going to
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.000]  have an event for a Mac.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.000]  I don't think so, but if they could do a combination with the iPad and make it all about
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.000]  work, because iPad Pro is for work and Mac is for work.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:20.000]  March timeframe makes
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:24.000]  perfect sense to me. If not, then WDC.
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:28.000]  Because the other thing too, the big iPad Pro is
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000]  lacking the True Tone display.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.000]  There's a couple of things,
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.000]  even if they, who knows, maybe they'll have surprising new things to announce.
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000]  But even just the obvious things, it seems like it's due for an update.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.000]  I love True Tone. I wish True Tone was on my phone.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000]  That's the one thing, I've said this before, and Schiller even said it when he announced it
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:56.000]  last year, that once you get used to it, you can't go back. And it made me think it was coming to the
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:00.000]  phone. Because I didn't think Schiller would say that if he didn't know it wasn't coming to the phone, and then it didn't
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000]  come to the phone. And it really, it's the one thing that annoys me about using my iPad
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.000]  is I have the 9.7 inch Pro, and
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:12.000]  it annoys me because then after I've read email on it
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.000]  or used it for like 45 minutes, I go and look at my
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:20.000]  phone, and if it's nighttime, it looks terrible.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000]  I want True Tone on everything.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.000]  It makes your phone look terrible.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.000]  Because you don't see it. You just don't notice.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:36.000]  It plays with your head.
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  I know that they're shifting the colors, and I'm so sensitive to that.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.000]  Every time I see somebody who uses night mode on their phone or whatever it's called,
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.000]  the thing that makes your phone yellow, I can't believe it.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:52.000]  I know there's lots of people who love that feature, but it sickens me because
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.000]  it looks like the phone is covered in urine or something.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.000]  Well, it's supposed to put you to sleep or make you not so awake.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.000]  So, I don't know.
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.000]  So anyway, I think there'll be a March event, but there's no rumors as such.
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:12.000]  And I don't know if that's sort of, in some
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.000]  ways, I really do think that if you take a step back and look,
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.000]  I do think that, you remember a couple years ago when Tim Cook said they're doubling down on secrecy?
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000]  I think in some ways they have. I think that in some ways
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  Apple has gotten better at keeping some things secret.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:32.000]  And that the only place where leaks come out of anymore is the supply chain.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.000]  And it's sort of outside Apple's control.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  Yeah, but then look at some of the stories that Gurman does, and those aren't coming out of the supply chains.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.000]  You know, like that Mac one.
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.000]  Yeah, but I have to publish my video. In the works, I think I even told Rene about it.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:52.000]  I talked back in 2016, my last episode.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:56.000]  I've got a response to that. And it's just taken a long time because it's
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.000]  I don't know why. Because I want to be careful.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.000]  But I really think that the more you look at that story
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  from Gurman, the less there is to it, other than the things that we know.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  Which are the obvious. That the iMac didn't get updated in 2016.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  The Mac Pro hasn't been updated in three years. The Mac Mini hasn't been updated in three years.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  And the MacBook Pros were
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  long in the tooth when they were just updated. But I also actually think the more you look at it,
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  there's nothing else in his story. There's nothing factual. And he says some things
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  that are ridiculous. Like, he has this story about how they had
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.000]  two versions of, I forget which product, but there were two versions in development
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  I think of the original MacBook.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  The super thin MacBook. Two versions in development, and then they decided to go
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  with this one. And it's somehow presented as like a sign
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:52.000]  of executive indecision at Apple and a lack of leadership
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  on the Mac that they did two designs and then choose one.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  That's how Apple works. I honestly, it's like
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  I've never heard of a product at Apple that didn't have multiple versions. In fact, the fact that there were
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.000]  only two is the most surprising part of it. Usually they do more. And on the software side
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.000]  they do like ten. Like everything, every new product at Apple usually
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  has like ten mock-ups of how the interface should look.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  And the designers, it's not like do one that's the real one
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  and then as busy work make nine inconsequential
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  changes knowing that you go to the meeting and they're going to
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:32.000]  pick the one. Like if you show up like that, you're on your way to get fired
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.000]  at Apple. You're expected to have ten mock-ups. All of them
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  might be the one that is, alright, choose number eight
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  but give us ten more based on number eight for next week. Go.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  That's how Apple works. They do, of course they have a plan B hardware.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  And with the MacBook, according to Germin's story, they went with the one
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  that was the more radical design. It's a sign that Apple is
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  pedal to the metal on being aggressive about
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  what they can do engineering-wise with the Mac as opposed to being lazy.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  Yeah, they're not afraid to go off on a left field
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  somewhere with any of their products. And another point
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  that Germin had in his story on Bloomberg was something to the effect of
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  that there was something with the batteries in the new Mac Pros that they
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  were going to go with a
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  this is an interesting thing if it's true because according to Germin
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  they tried to have a bunch of smaller batteries that fill
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  up more of the space in the device
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.000]  and failed some kind of test so they had to go with a more
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  traditional single rectangular battery that
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  I don't think it would have
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  the incremental improvement of having a sort of stair-step
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:56.000]  battery design that fills more of the crevices isn't
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  going to radically double the battery life. That's like a way to get five to
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  ten percent more battery life out of a device. It's interesting
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.000]  that if it's true that they couldn't pull that off for the MacBook Pro
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  because that's the actual design that they showed
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  that's what they're doing with the MacBooks. Remember that
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  part of the product video for the MacBooks
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  I think it was like Dan Ricci that was describing how they do that.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  But anyway, the gist of Germin's story with this battery thing was that they
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  went with this simpler battery that maybe
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  presumably Germin didn't have numbers but I would guess maybe gets like ten percent less battery life than the other
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  design. They went with it so that they could ship it now. Because otherwise
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  if they had waited until they could pull the other design off
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  here we would be in January 2017 and we still wouldn't have new MacBook Pros.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  And then this whole discussion that we're having about the languishing
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  hardware, we'd also be talking about, well the MacBook Pro hasn't been updated
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  in three years or whatever. You know what I mean? Like, you can't have it
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  both ways. They have to ship eventually and there's always room for improvement.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  And if there's no room for improvement, then who cares? Then it's fine.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  If there's no way, if they've developed the perfect MacBook Pro that never
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  needs an update, then what are we talking about?
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  So anyway, I don't get it.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  I don't either.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  What else? I lost my train of thought. Where are we going?
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  2017. What's happening?
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  Oh, with the rumors. We were talking about Tim Cook
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  and doubling down on secrecy. And if they have a March event coming
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  nobody knows because they've kept their mouth shut. I don't know.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  And it could be. I don't know. Maybe there's rumors of updated iPads that I just haven't seen, but
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  I haven't seen them. I haven't seen them. But I think they do. And it would be a good time
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  to release new iMacs, I think.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  We kind of
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  set the expectations, though, don't we? When we say
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  well, it's been a year. It's time.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  They need to update.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  Maybe they don't. I think they do eventually.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  I think the iPad is still, there's too much to be gained. The A10
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  is just so much better than the A9. The A9's great and the current iPad Pros are great.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  But it's like one of the most amazing stories in
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  technology the last few years is the A-series
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.000]  processors that Apple's turning out. It's like a return
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:40.000]  to the early years of the PC industry where every year
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  you're getting these incredible Moore's Law. I mean, they
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  keep showing the graphs at the iPhone events of the CPU and GPU
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  performance year over year. And it's like a hockey
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  stick curve. It's getting more and more amazing, whereas you would think
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  it would be more incremental because that's what it's like on the desktop size, right?
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  The new MacBook Pros performance-wise, they're not, nobody's bragging about
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  how much faster the new MacBook Pros are than the previous ones because being faster is no longer
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  really, that's not really where PCs are improving.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  But they could do that for sure with the iPad just by going
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  from the A9 to the A10.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.000]  How important is speed on an
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  iPad Pro in comparison to, say,
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.000]  usability? I mean, there you're talking more
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  the UI and UX as opposed to the
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:40.000]  actual speed of the device itself. I don't know, you could say the same
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.000]  thing about the phone too though, right? I don't know. I think that it is important.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  I think just in terms of, in some ways I think just
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  in terms of, it improves battery life, right?
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  Like, the faster the CPU can be done doing anything,
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  the less the CPU is using the battery. I think it's
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  a big part of it. I guess there are rumors,
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  I did see rumors, I do remember this before, you know, just to show that
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.000]  I'm not totally out of touch of iPad rumors, that there's rumors from the supply chain that there's going to
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  be a third iPad size. Have you seen that?
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  It's like in between 9.7
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  it's like an 11 inch iPad. It doesn't make any sense to me,
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  quite frankly. Yeah, that seems weird. I don't see why, it doesn't
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  make any sense to me that they would make an iPad in between those two
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  sizes. But we shall see.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  I don't get that. I think if it's true, it would probably
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  be something to the effect that the older screen sizes
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  are being moved down the product line to the mid-range and that the new size
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  is the new top of the line iPad. Here, I'll send
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  you a link. I'll send you a link right here. Apple planning thicker
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:00.000]  bezel-free 10.9 inch iPad Pro with 9.7
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  inch footprint and no home button. So in other words, the idea would be, it would be
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  like, physically, the device would be the size of
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  the current 9.7 inch iPad Pro. But the display would be bigger
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  because they're going to get rid of the bezels surrounding it.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  Let me take a break, since this
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  seems like a break in the action here, and thank our third and final sponsor, long time

[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  Great cause. Agreed.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.000]  Let me see what else I have here in my notes. How about the Apple New York Times
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:56.000]  in China? News came out two days ago that
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.000]  Apple has pulled the New York Times apps
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:04.000]  from the app store in the People's Republic of China.
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:08.000]  And I wrote about
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.000]  it and I got a whole bunch of shit.
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:16.000]  Well, my take is that their headline
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.000]  is Apple removes New York Times apps from its store in China. That's what the New York Times said.
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:24.000]  I think a more accurate headline would be something along the lines of China compels Apple to remove
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.000]  New York Times apps from its store in China. Cause it doesn't sound to me like Apple had any choice.
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:32.000]  I mean, other than to actually get in a pissing match
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.000]  with the People's Republic of China, which would surely result in them pulling
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.000]  the plug on the app store, right? I don't understand the people who
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:44.000]  think you have a choice. I mean, this is the problem with authoritarian
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.000]  regimes in a place like China, where they have no freedom of the press
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:52.000]  or anything like that. It's not like here. It's not like, you know, Apple is willing to
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:56.000]  fight the FBI on unlocking an iPhone. It's different. Right.
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:00.000]  You can fight the FBI here because it's a free country and you can go to court
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:04.000]  and argue with the FBI in court. You can't go
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:08.000]  to court with the People's Republic of China and fight to keep the New York Times
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:12.000]  app in the store. When China comes to you and says, you've got to take this out of the store, you've got
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:16.000]  to take it out of the store. So I don't understand what people
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.000]  want Apple to do other than pull out of China.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  Which, I don't think, you know,
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.000]  if you want to be, what's the word,
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:32.000]  it certainly wouldn't make any business sense to do it.
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  But if you think that in a moral regard, Apple should simply stop doing
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:40.000]  business in China, I mean, that's a reasonable take and I can listen to the argument, but
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.000]  Tim Cook's not going to do it. I don't understand what
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:48.000]  the argument is that Apple could still have an app store
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  in China and sell their products in China and not
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:56.000]  comply with the Chinese government when they say, you've got
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:00.000]  to remove the New York Times apps from the app store.
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:04.000]  Is it unfortunate that they have that much control over Apple?
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:08.000]  Yeah, of course. Right, and of over a billion people, yeah.
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:12.000]  Wouldn't it be one of the greatest things that could happen in the world would be for the Chinese government
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:16.000]  to open up and support things similar to our Bill of Rights.
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  That would be great, but that's not the way the world is.
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  No. So Apple is in a very tough position.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:28.000]  Like you said, there was no choice.
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:32.000]  Right, and I think Apple knows that it looks bad. I don't think Apple is like, okay, okay, we'll do whatever you want.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.000]  And they don't care. I think Apple cares deeply
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:40.000]  about it and wishes that the Chinese
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:44.000]  government didn't do this. But the other thing that's interesting to me, and I think it's sort of downplayed
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.000]  in most of the stories about it, is that the New York Times website has been blocked in China since 2012.
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:52.000]  So the existence of the New York Times apps,
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.000]  and obviously probably most people, surely most people in China don't have iPhones
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.000]  because they're so expensive and the average
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:04.000]  income in China is very low, but it's obviously
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:08.000]  a big part of Apple's market. They're selling more and more of their products
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:12.000]  in China every year, and for the people who can't afford it, the App Store gave
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:16.000]  them access to the New York Times that they couldn't get through the internet
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:20.000]  or through the web. I shouldn't say internet, since obviously it's coming down
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:24.000]  through the internet.
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  Well, when all this
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:32.000]  FBI stuff was going on, didn't Apple say that China wanted a version
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  of their operating system as well, and Apple said no? I think so.
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  I wouldn't be surprised if they asked for that. I mean, because I think that's the sort of thing
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  that Apple really would, if push came to shove, would get out of China over.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  If China said, you have to give us the source code to iOS or
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  we won't allow you to sell your iPhones in China, I think Apple would
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  I really do think that Apple would say, alright, we can't sell iPhones in China and we'll take the hit
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.000]  on sales, we'll take the hit on the stock, but there's no way that they're going to give
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  up the source code to iOS to anybody, let alone the Chinese
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  government. So, you know, Apple will make a stand
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  but, you know, that's
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  that would be a stand on their own software
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  not an app. So, I
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  they didn't have a choice. It sucks. It's terrible. I feel bad
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  for them, but, you know, I feel worse for the people in China. I mean, it's
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  the problem is the Chinese government, not Apple. Right.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  Right. I probably just got the talk show banned. Well, there you go.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  Yeah, you're done. You've been banned
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  at Apple, too, so, done. Derek Farval is now banned
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  in China. I wonder if it's banned. I don't know. I don't know. I have no idea.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:52.000]  What else? I've got this on my list, and I know
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  you're still wearing your Apple Watch, right? I am. Because you
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  have written extensively that the fitness features on Apple Watch
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  long story short have led you to, you lost a lot of weight and you're
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  exercising a lot more regularly. It's like
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  right out of an Apple commercial. Except I don't think they're going to put someone who looks like
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  you in an Apple commercial. I don't think so. They should, because I'm
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  really pretty. Apple sent me, I'm
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  wearing it right now. They sent me the Nike Plus Apple Watch.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.000]  Oh, yeah. I think it's, honest to God, I think it's the best
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  Apple Watch. Because they, when
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  the new Apple Watches first came out, the review unit I had was the
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:40.000]  regular stainless steel one. Yeah. I think
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:44.000]  that the aluminum one is better. Honest to God, I really do.
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  I've always suspected this, and I really, you know, I just like it better.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  It feels to me like the digital crown spins better. I think the
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.000]  Taptic engine feels slightly better. I think that the steel is harder for the
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  Taptics to get through than the aluminum. I don't think it's a huge difference, but I think it's a subtle difference.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  I think it's a great product.
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:08.000]  The rumor that came out last week, I linked to this, was that one
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  rumor came out about the next Apple Watch, which was that the company that's
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:16.000]  manufacturing it is saying that their primary mission from Apple is to increase
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  significantly increased battery life. I don't have a problem
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  with battery life. Well, I have a few thoughts on that.
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:28.000]  I think the Series 2 Watch gets so much better
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:32.000]  at battery life than the Series 1. I think
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  in my review of it, I think I missed just how much better it is. And I don't know if it's because
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  watchOS 3.1 made it better. Because it seems like watchOS 3.1
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  was a tremendous bug fix release for what was already
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  a great release. WatchOS 3.0
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  was a great release, feature-wise and interface-wise.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  But 3.1 seems to have really fixed a lot of
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  little things. Every once in a while,
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:04.000]  when your Apple Watch, it's right there next to your iPhone, but it says it doesn't see
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  your iPhone. You get that little red, the little red, I don't see the iPhone.
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  And then a minute later it goes away and it's fine. I never see that anymore.
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  Little things like that, like being connected to what you think
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:20.000]  it's connected to, or the way that it unlocks your iMac
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  now. It never doesn't see it. It's always there.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.000]  I don't know. I just think that
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  the battery life I'm getting on this is tremendous. I'm getting at least two days of battery
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.000]  life, sometimes even more. Where I can wear the watch to sleep and wake up in the
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.000]  morning and it's still, after starting the day before at 100% charge, it's still at like
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.000]  60%. See, I'm in the habit
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  of, I wear my watch all day long, never take it off.
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.000]  When I go to bed, I put it in the, I have one of those
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:56.000]  little stand chargers from
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:00.000]  Apple, where the thing pops up from the middle. I put it on there.
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:04.000]  As soon as I get up in the morning, I put it on my wrist and I go.
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  So, my habit is to just leave it
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:12.000]  charging all night and put it on in the day and it never runs out on me.
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:16.000]  So, and I use it a lot.
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  I actually use the Apple Watch a lot. So, you know, it's not that
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  it's just sitting idle all day long. I'm doing
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:28.000]  the fitness stuff on it. I always
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:32.000]  check my messages on it, you know, when alerts
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.000]  come in and things, just to see what's going on.
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.000]  So, yeah, I use it.
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:44.000]  Here's the report. This is from Chinese language Economic
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  Daily News. Claimed that the next iteration of the wearable device will be
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  manufactured by Taiwan-based Quanta, which is already the company
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  that's making the first and second generation watches for Apple. So, it sounds like
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:00.000]  they're changing and that citing market watchers and knowledge of Quanta's
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:04.000]  plans, the paper said improving battery life is the manufacturer's
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  main task. But beside general performance improvements,
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:12.000]  the device's other hardware would not see much change. That's the
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  report. Here's one thing I wrote, is that I would love to
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.000]  see it and always on display. It bothers me,
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:24.000]  always has as a long-time watch wearer, that
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  sometimes I look at the watch and instead of seeing the time, I see it's just black.
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:32.000]  But, I will add, as somebody who's annoyed by that and still wears
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  non-Apple watches occasionally,
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:40.000]  not even occasionally, but like when I, you know, I like my mechanical watches,
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  I think that the wrist detection
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:48.000]  has gotten better than ever. I think that they've continued to, I think it's always been pretty good,
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  but I think it's gotten even better, where there are fewer and fewer times where if I look at the watch, the
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:56.000]  face isn't on, but I'd still like to see it always on display.
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  That would take more power and possibly a different display
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  technology to prevent burn-in. That was my
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:08.000]  idea for why they, you know, other than, like
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:12.000]  don't think about it as going between charges. Think about like what could the
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:16.000]  watch do with the same charge it every day or charge it every other day
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  span, but what could it do with more battery life? The other things,
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:24.000]  and I didn't even think of these, but it's obvious, people chimed
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  in on Twitter, what if they added LTE networking and or
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:32.000]  GPS?
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.000]  Well, I think the watch is eventually going to
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  get, I don't know, see the thing about LTE is that you've got to pay, right? It's like
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:44.000]  there's no way, even like look at the iPads, what does it cost, like 25 bucks a month to get?
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  What's the cheapest plan you can get with an iPad?
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  Yeah, well, you get a rolling plan,
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  isn't it? Isn't that the cheapest where it's, you know, you pay five dollars
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  but then you add stuff like that. So if they add LTE,
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  I mean, obviously in terms of features, it'd be great in some ways where you could just
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  go out with a watch and you could still get text messages and stuff like that.
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:12.000]  I mean, that'd be a tremendous feature, but, you know,
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.000]  I don't know if that's a top priority, just because you have to pay for it.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:20.000]  Yeah, I don't think that's a priority for me. GPS could be, though,
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.000]  because they have, they've really, I feel like one of the things that they really figured out
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  in between the original and the Series
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:32.000]  2 hardware and watchOS 3 is that the fitness stuff
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  is, it was always one of the tent pole features, but I think that they've really figured
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  out that this is why people buy the watches, right?
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:44.000]  People want notifications and people want fitness tracking. And the fitness tracking
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:48.000]  GPS is a huge reason, that's a huge, huge reason why people,
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  it's probably the only reason why people would still buy stuff from Garmin, right? I mean,
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.000]  if it's not for GPS, I don't know why you would buy that. So in terms of
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.000]  just the competitive landscape, what are the reasons somebody would buy
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:04.000]  something other than, if they're going to put something on their wrist for fitness,
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:08.000]  right? Just, I'm going to get a gadget, it's going to go on my wrist, it's going to help me
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:12.000]  track my fitness. What are the reasons you would not, you would buy something other than Apple Watch?
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:16.000]  GPS is one of them. But on the other hand,
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:20.000]  you know, you look at the ones with Garmin that are GPS, they're big.
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  They're very large. Yeah. I don't know how important
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:28.000]  that is to me, though. It may not be important to you. I don't think it would be important
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  to me at all, because I don't go anywhere.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  I do jog, but I jog the same path every day, so I don't need to see,
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  you know, I don't need to see a map of where I go, like,
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.000]  it's boring. I just know exactly the path that I take. I can tell you
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  exactly, you know, you can look at my watch and see the runs, and I can tell you exactly
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  where I went, because I just take the same path.
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  But for some people, it's huge. I know some, I have some friends who
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:00.000]  are serious about their bicycling, and
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  GPS is fundamental to their workouts. You know, they go,
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  they want to know exactly the trail they took on a bike ride.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:12.000]  Well, the Apple Watch, the Series 2
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:16.000]  does have GPS tracking in it. Not on its own, though, right?
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  Does it? Yeah, on its own. It does? Yeah.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  I didn't know it had GPS. Are you serious? Yeah.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  No, it goes through the phone, right? No, no, no, you don't need the phone anymore.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  Really? Yeah. Well then,
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  I didn't know that. Or at least I didn't remember it. For tracking,
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  so that you can, it will track where you walk, and it makes
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:44.000]  it better, you know, you've walked
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:48.000]  the speed and all that kind of stuff. Huh. Well, how about
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:52.000]  that? I didn't know that. I don't know if it'll do
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:56.000]  like maps and stuff like that. Yeah, see, that's what I'm talking about.
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:00.000]  I don't think, I don't think, that's what I'm talking about. I'm talking about like, it always knows
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.000]  where you are. It's a GPS tracking, so if I go out to
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:08.000]  do a workout, and I start
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:12.000]  a workout, it knows where I am as I'm walking around.
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:16.000]  Huh. And when I get home and it syncs to my phone,
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:20.000]  it actually puts a little map in the activity
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:24.000]  app. Yeah, I'm looking at the website, built in GPS. Of where
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:28.000]  I went. This is a real test for me, Jim. Do I let this stand where
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:32.000]  I talked for two minutes about how the watch could add GPS, or do I edit it out?
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:36.000]  No, cut it out. I think we should let it stand. Alright, let
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  it stand. I think we should let it stand and people can know that I'm a podcaster with
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:44.000]  integrity. Built-in GPS. I forgot. I either didn't know
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:48.000]  it, wasn't paying attention, or completely forgot that the watch already has built-in GPS. So,
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:52.000]  LTE would obviously be the addition. Don't tell me it already
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:56.000]  has LTE. No, it does not. See,
[01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:00.000]  I think in order to do, maybe in order to do the type of
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:04.000]  GPS that you're talking about, it would need
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:08.000]  LTE. Right? No,
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:12.000]  I don't think so. I'm talking about, I think it's got, it must already have what I was talking
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:16.000]  about. Okay. So, I, so
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:20.000]  the thing that I did with my watch when I got the Series 2,
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:24.000]  I would always take my phone with me and then
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:28.000]  it would have, my watch would have GPS, but with
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:32.000]  Apple Watch Series 2, I didn't need to take the phone with me anymore
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:36.000]  and I had the wireless headphones. I put a music list on my
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:40.000]  watch so I could listen to music wirelessly from my watch and
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:44.000]  have it track where I was walking. And when I got back, it would sync
[01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:48.000]  with my phone and everything would be there.
[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:52.000]  So, that part is kind of cool. The single thing
[01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:56.000]  that they could do for Apple Watch that would make me happier
[01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:00.000]  would be to make it easier to
[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:04.000]  easier to put music on the watch and like not make me
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:08.000]  have to do it in advance and to make it easier
[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:12.000]  specifically for third party developers to load content on the watch.
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:16.000]  Because what I want in particular is I want, I use over, Marco's
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:20.000]  overcast to listen to podcasts. And most of what I do, and always
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:24.000]  when I go for a jog, always, almost always, I listen to podcasts.
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.000]  I would love to do it and be able to leave my phone at home and not
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.000]  have to jump through like 10 minutes of hoops of syncing this to that.
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:36.000]  Just have it, just trust that automatically the watch already has
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:40.000]  like, you know, the two most
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:44.000]  recent episodes of all the podcasts I subscribe to already on it. So I can just go
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:48.000]  out with AirPods and the watch and just play podcasts.
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  I would love that. That would be good. Because going with the phone, it's
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:56.000]  you know, it's just, there's no good place to put a phone
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:00.000]  if you're going out for a run. No, and I usually jog in my Speedos
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:04.000]  so that makes it even more difficult.
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:08.000]  There now I've been banned in
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:12.000]  Chinatown. Anything else that you want to talk about? Anything else in the
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  news that's on your mind, Jim? No, no, it's been a
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:20.000]  pretty good, a pretty good end of year. I think it was
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:24.000]  pretty calm except for the Mac stuff.
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.000]  Well, what about this new, the iPhone rumors
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  about edge-to-edge class? What do you think about that?
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:36.000]  The rumors don't make any sense to me. I've heard that they're working on an
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:40.000]  edge-to-edge iPhone. I heard that a while ago. And it's, I think, no surprise.
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:44.000]  I think it, you know, there's a lot, it makes a lot of sense. I think the fact that they've gotten rid
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:48.000]  of the physical home button, it makes logical sense that they're
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:52.000]  moving in that direction, that that could be one reason that they did that.
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:56.000]  Side note,
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:00.000]  by the way, the other day my iPhone ran out before the end of the day
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:04.000]  of battery. For the first time, I think it might be the first time that happened to me
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:08.000]  since I've had the iPhone 7. I don't know what I've, I guess I was using it all
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:12.000]  day. And it ran out. And it didn't run out
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:16.000]  while I was using it. It was like on my desk and I was like ready to call it a night.
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:20.000]  I was doing something on my computer really late at night. And I picked it up
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:24.000]  and I went to press the home button and it didn't move because it was dead.
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:28.000]  And it felt gross. It was almost like I wanted to drop it like I, you know, like
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:32.000]  like I picked up a dead mouse or something.
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:36.000]  It felt, it was, because I expected it to turn on. I had
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:40.000]  no reason to think that the battery was dead. And the fact that the button didn't move, it
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.000]  didn't just feel wrong. It felt gross. Anyway, so anyway
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:48.000]  I could see them moving to an edge-to-edge design. But the specific rumors don't make any
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:52.000]  sense to me because the specific rumors are that they've got new phones in development
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:56.000]  at the current sizes, 4.7 and 5.5 inch displays.
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:00.000]  And a new one that's 5.8
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:04.000]  inches diagonally. And it makes no sense to me that they would come out with all of
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:08.000]  those. Like, I could see that they would come out with a phone with a 5.8
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:12.000]  inch diagonal display in a bezel-less
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:16.000]  case or a much smaller bezel case so that the physical device
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:20.000]  isn't much bigger, right? Like, and some people have, you know, with rulers you can
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:24.000]  figure out that if they really do get rid of the forehead and chin
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:28.000]  bezels, that a 5.8 inch display wouldn't really even be
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:32.000]  a plus-sized phone. It would be slightly bigger than the regular
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:36.000]  iPhone 7. It would be a little bit wider, but mostly the same height.
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  So in terms of overall size, it might be very similar. That
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:44.000]  going from 4.7 to 5.8 really is just the diagonal of those
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  bezels. So I could see that, but I don't see why in the world would they come out with
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:52.000]  new phones with the old sizes. It doesn't make any sense to me that they'd come out with all of them.
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:56.000]  So the only way that the rumors make any sense to me is if this
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:00.000]  involves Apple still being in a plan A,
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:04.000]  plan B scenario, where plan A would be to go with
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:08.000]  this radical new edge-to-edge design
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  and plan B would be if we feel like
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  when it gets to the point where we have to say go and put this stuff into production
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:20.000]  if we don't think we're ready to make a September ship date
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:24.000]  we're going to have to go with plan B, which is to keep the same sizes and come out with just
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:28.000]  the 7S and 7S Plus next year. But I don't see
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:32.000]  why they would do both. It doesn't make any sense to me that they would come out with
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:36.000]  for lack of a better word, let's just call it the iPhone 8 with a radical edge-to-edge
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  design, come out with that and come out with the 7S Plus
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  it doesn't make any sense. Or 7S, 7S and 7S Plus. It doesn't make
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:48.000]  any sense. That's an awful big gamble though. It's a huge
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  gamble. But that's the only way it makes sense to me. I don't see
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  why they would come out with a third size.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:00.000]  I think if they come out with a new edge-to-edge display
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:04.000]  this year, then the 7 and 7 Plus
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:08.000]  just stay exactly as they are and move to the middle price points.
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:12.000]  I don't see why they would come out with new phones
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:16.000]  that are of a radical design and come out with new phones that have
[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:20.000]  the same as last year's design. Who'd buy those?
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:24.000]  Nobody. Right. Well, I mean you're always going to have the people that will complain
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:28.000]  about edge-to-edge. I've talked about this with a bunch of
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:32.000]  people on Twitter too and people say well maybe this new edge-to-edge one, they won't be able to make it
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:36.000]  in huge quantities. So that's why
[02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:40.000]  they would do the 7S and 7S Plus too. That's not good.
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:44.000]  If they can't do it in sufficient quantities, then why release it?
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:48.000]  That would be the most Apple-like thing I've ever heard of.
[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:52.000]  To have a device that they make and that they can't make enough of
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:56.000]  on purpose? That doesn't make any sense.
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:00.000]  And so what? You'd have what? One million lucky
[02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:04.000]  people who got the ones that come out and
[02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:08.000]  fifty million people who are like, well I wanted the cool one but I guess I'll get
[02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:12.000]  the one that's not cool and pay $800 for a phone that
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:16.000]  they didn't really want? That doesn't make any sense to me.
[02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:20.000]  It's doubt.
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:24.000]  It certainly is an interesting rumor though.
[02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:28.000]  It's very similar to the iPad rumor I told you where there's this
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:32.000]  third size with no bezels, right?
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:36.000]  It's sort of the same thing in both directions, but I don't know who knows whether they're ready for it.
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:40.000]  Doesn't make sense to me.
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:44.000]  But
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:48.000]  we'll see soon enough I guess. The other thing that's weird about the rumor to me
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:52.000]  is that this new third size, 5.8 inch, would be
[02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:56.000]  that there's only one
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:00.000]  that if they come out with a new edge to edge
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:04.000]  design and it has this 5.8 inch display that they're talking about, there's
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:08.000]  only one size of it. And that sounds unusual to me. It seems to me like this
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:12.000]  two size thing is a big part of Apple's
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:16.000]  appeal of the iPhone lineup.
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:20.000]  Doesn't make any sense to me. What would that make bringing
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:24.000]  the other two products
[02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:28.000]  along? Would that make that make more sense? No, it doesn't make
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:32.000]  any sense to me. No, but what if they only released one size of the edge
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.000]  to edge? I don't know.
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:40.000]  I guess they could, but it doesn't seem to fit with the
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:44.000]  pattern of Apple's previous releases. No, I agree.
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:48.000]  Anyway, at least there's something for us to write about this year.
[02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:52.000]  Well, it seems that there's going to be a few things to write about for sure.
[02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:56.000]  Jim, I thank you for your
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:00.000]  time. It's always good to have you on the show. People can get all the Dalrymple they want at your
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:04.000]  website, The Loop, which is at loopinsight.com

[02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:12.000]  correct? I am, yep. And that's where they can get your tweets, which are
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:16.000]  always a pleasure.
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:20.000]  Cheerful. If you want to get cheered up, follow
