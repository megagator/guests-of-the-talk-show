[00:00.000 --> 00:05.200]  uh what do you want to talk about first we've got we don't have too much but uh i think the macbook
[00:05.200 --> 00:09.440]  pros are still interesting because i had a show before thanksgiving with jason snell but at the
[00:09.440 --> 00:16.240]  time we had recorded that it was sort of at the time i like maybe possibly early orders were like
[00:16.240 --> 00:20.960]  unboxing their macbook pros but at the time it was really just people who had the the review units
[00:20.960 --> 00:27.040]  who'd had them whereas now lots and lots of people have macbook pros we have some real world
[00:27.040 --> 00:31.360]  experience might as well talk about it first yeah and i reached out to you because i was
[00:31.360 --> 00:36.880]  when you um i i really enjoyed your review and then let me let me pull up what you said about
[00:36.880 --> 00:44.480]  my review um i don't remember it was it was good and i was like i need to come on the podcast and
[00:44.480 --> 00:52.400]  defend myself um and and you know what we also we can talk about because i'm gonna i decided
[00:52.400 --> 00:59.520]  i'm gonna put the mic right up against the macbook pro keyboard so um even though your your your
[00:59.520 --> 01:04.880]  listeners your listeners don't like loud sounds i can just be typing on my macbook pro the entire
[01:04.880 --> 01:09.520]  time and which will annoy them or maybe that won't annoy them that is a good topic i i'm glad you
[01:09.520 --> 01:14.480]  brought that up i would have been furious if if we hit stop and rick stopped recording and never
[01:14.480 --> 01:20.880]  brought up the the sound allowed keyboards all right what did i say let's see i can find it first
[01:20.880 --> 01:27.200]  oh so you said um so you said very good take as usual it felt really good to get that and then
[01:27.840 --> 01:34.720]  i i say that it that it's baffling let me i'll quote what i what i wrote i said um why this
[01:34.720 --> 01:40.320]  isn't available and this is the the touch id isn't available on all of apple's macbook laptops
[01:40.320 --> 01:46.560]  especially the entry level 13 inch no touch bar pro is baffling and you said not baffling at all
[01:46.560 --> 01:50.560]  or maybe you should do it you should read your own things it's like an interactive
[01:50.560 --> 01:55.440]  no yeah you should do it you should well i should do like your your voice what i think is your voice
[01:55.440 --> 02:02.160]  yes yeah you should just do my voice not baffling at all with apple you have to pay for awesome new
[02:02.160 --> 02:09.680]  stuff is that a good impression that's pretty good i think touch id combined with the secure
[02:09.680 --> 02:17.280]  enclave is a is at least half the value of the entire touch bar it's funny because i would say
[02:17.280 --> 02:21.600]  no pun intended your impression your impression of me is is a little stern
[02:23.520 --> 02:28.320]  it is much better than my wife's though my wife's impression of me is always sort of that i'm like
[02:28.320 --> 02:34.880]  adult that's how that's how amy does does me and it's pretty
[02:34.880 --> 02:40.000]  um yeah i i actually just hear your voice i don't hear i don't hear whatever voice i did that was
[02:40.000 --> 02:46.560]  just like a that's just what uh yeah a blogger a man with a computer you know that's what i
[02:46.560 --> 02:51.040]  picture all men with computers not baffling at all
[02:54.800 --> 02:58.640]  uh but you know what this is exactly what i mean now what i mean by that and you know
[02:58.640 --> 03:03.360]  it's the format of during fireball that i tried to do and it's the format of during fireball
[03:03.360 --> 03:11.600]  that i tried to be no do no apologizing what's that are you apologizing for for no i'm not
[03:11.600 --> 03:17.760]  apologizing but i i sometimes wonder if it's too easy to it's easy to be a little because
[03:17.760 --> 03:21.920]  i'm so terse sometimes that it's you know i i that's this is why i sort of like having
[03:21.920 --> 03:26.960]  a podcast on the side is that we can go on lengthy digressions over i mean i'm looking
[03:26.960 --> 03:37.040]  at it right now two sentences uh you know it's when when something new comes out like
[03:37.040 --> 03:42.960]  uh touch id it's only available on the premium price models and you have to wait you know
[03:42.960 --> 03:48.480]  and i'm sure like a year from now the the mid-range model will probably be upgraded
[03:48.480 --> 03:55.680]  with you know the touch bar i i hear that but let's let's think about how long iphone
[03:55.680 --> 04:02.720]  owners have had touch id almost i would say now what 90 percent of iphone owners have
[04:02.720 --> 04:10.480]  touch id yeah i would think so i'd say i mean how many like going back to five s right right
[04:11.360 --> 04:16.320]  so okay maybe i don't know i don't have the percentages you know really only apple has
[04:16.320 --> 04:22.080]  the percentages but um that's that's a long time and we've all gotten used to using it
[04:22.080 --> 04:28.000]  on our iphone and it's great it's it's it's magical really you the the fact that you're
[04:28.000 --> 04:31.760]  able to do so many things now with your your your fingerprint and you don't have to punch
[04:31.760 --> 04:38.320]  in passwords it really made lives better it makes your life better on the macbook pro
[04:39.120 --> 04:44.480]  why can't i do it on a macbook why can't i do it on really just the macbook because that's
[04:44.480 --> 04:50.800]  really the only two new laptops that apple has um it just it kind of makes sense and
[04:50.800 --> 04:57.280]  and on on the and on the 13 inch no touch bar which is supposed to be i think what they thought
[04:57.280 --> 05:05.760]  would be a very sort of not entry level for 1500 obviously but this basic model it seems like you
[05:05.760 --> 05:09.280]  could have this without the touch bar now i know there's a lot of technology that you could that
[05:09.280 --> 05:15.360]  that comes along with the touch bar but i don't know it just seems like it should be there my
[05:15.360 --> 05:24.080]  guess is that part of it is product marketing meaning putting the this appealing new feature
[05:24.080 --> 05:29.680]  only at these higher price points what i think it's like 1799 for the first one that has the
[05:29.680 --> 05:37.840]  touch bar yeah um 1800 versus 1500 for the entry i say i keep saying entry level but it's i guess
[05:37.840 --> 05:44.080]  it is entry level for the new macbook pros right right and it's you know clearly clearly occupies
[05:44.080 --> 05:50.560]  the mid-range of the overall lineup it is right i would say it is the central you know it's the
[05:50.560 --> 05:56.880]  very middle of the lineup that and like you know combined with the high-end regular macbook are
[05:56.880 --> 06:00.480]  sort of right there around the same price point and it's you know which one do you want the super
[06:00.480 --> 06:07.440]  thin and light or the more powerful one right and i think my recommendation i i had i struggled with
[06:07.440 --> 06:13.280]  this review more than any review i've written in a number of years because to me there wasn't a very
[06:13.280 --> 06:19.040]  very clear you should get this one um not that i usually tell people you should get this one but
[06:19.040 --> 06:26.400]  it that you sort of you talk through what you may want but it was so complicated and when you looked
[06:26.400 --> 06:32.000]  at that 13 inch without the touch bar without touch id without the extra ports with the slower
[06:32.000 --> 06:38.160]  processor it's like why even though that seems like the one you'd you'd want to recommend to
[06:38.160 --> 06:42.400]  people right if you don't need the touch bar get this one but you but you can't really say that
[06:42.400 --> 06:46.480]  because it doesn't have touch id it doesn't have the extra ports and you're sort of like in this
[06:46.480 --> 06:53.200]  place where you're like you should pay 300 more to get this other one even though you might not
[06:53.200 --> 06:59.520]  use the touch bar yeah and if you compare that model the new 13-inch as it's called the macbook
[06:59.520 --> 07:08.640]  escape right right if you compare that one to the remaining old generation 13-inch macbook pros that
[07:08.640 --> 07:16.240]  they're still selling the ones that have the sd card slot and it you know the old school uh usba
[07:16.240 --> 07:22.480]  ports uh it's it's cool that's a tough decision for that would be a tough decision even for me
[07:22.480 --> 07:28.400]  personally like if i and that was the that's my entire review right like my entire review was
[07:28.960 --> 07:35.920]  there's a new thing it's good i i don't think it's bad it's very good there's a lot of great things
[07:35.920 --> 07:40.880]  in it but there's this old thing that is also still really good even though it hasn't been
[07:40.880 --> 07:46.480]  updated in many years and i don't really know which one to tell you to buy so let's just go
[07:46.480 --> 07:53.520]  through what's good here what's bad there and you decide yeah um and i still like like i don't even
[07:53.520 --> 07:58.320]  want to think about like i'm happy we did this podcast like a couple weeks after because like
[07:58.320 --> 08:04.400]  my brain hurt from thinking about macbooks so much yeah i agree it's it was actually great timing
[08:04.400 --> 08:09.440]  because it was happening during the election and it was a good escape in a way yeah escape
[08:10.640 --> 08:18.080]  it was the election escape key um that's pretty good actually so it was the macbook was the
[08:18.080 --> 08:23.040]  election escape key for me you know like i i spent a lot of hours like being able to think
[08:23.040 --> 08:29.280]  about laptops and not being able to not having to think about uh what the disaster that was happening
[08:29.280 --> 08:35.520]  everywhere else so i will say this i i think you have a very good point that maybe it has taken
[08:35.520 --> 08:41.440]  too long for touch id to come to macbooks in general that if you know if we had it on ios all
[08:41.440 --> 08:46.720]  the way back to the 5s why is november 2016 the first time it was available for the mac
[08:47.360 --> 08:50.880]  there i think you have a strong point and i can't really refute it it seems to me
[08:51.520 --> 08:57.680]  like if anything more proof on the side of right if you had a video podcast you'd see me dancing
[08:57.680 --> 09:05.680]  in my office right now that ios is the favored child of at apple and the mac is the you know
[09:06.720 --> 09:11.200]  you know second second fiddle i think that you know you could definitely argue that
[09:11.200 --> 09:16.800]  uh it it might even be hard to argue otherwise because how how long ago was the 5s last year was
[09:16.800 --> 09:24.400]  the six plus six six plus six s success the year before was the six the year before so three years
[09:24.400 --> 09:31.040]  ago was when the 5s was new that's pretty long right right four four years ago right yeah um
[09:31.920 --> 09:37.360]  so that's pretty long and i i agree with that what i'm not surprised by my take is that whenever
[09:37.360 --> 09:41.520]  it did first appear on the mac of course it's going to start only at the high end and then
[09:41.520 --> 09:47.680]  trickle down year year after year so i think you have a good point that maybe the first max with
[09:47.680 --> 09:53.680]  touch id should have appeared across the lineup like 18 months after the 5s or something like
[09:53.680 --> 09:59.760]  that yeah and and across the lineup is my well across the lineup you know but across the lineup
[09:59.760 --> 10:03.600]  never wouldn't would have wouldn't happen all at once it would but but then if it had happened
[10:03.600 --> 10:08.400]  right right if it had happened two years ago then by now it would be across the lineup
[10:09.040 --> 10:13.680]  right well or at least why didn't it come with the macbook and it was that was in my review when
[10:13.680 --> 10:17.920]  i reviewed the macbook when it first came out why is this not here and why is it still not there
[10:17.920 --> 10:25.520]  right yeah it could be i mean maybe it's maybe and maybe i would you know i people have had it
[10:25.520 --> 10:28.880]  now you're like you mentioned the beginning of the podcast people now have had the these new
[10:28.880 --> 10:34.320]  macbook pros maybe they aren't finding that it's a huge game changer for them but i mean i i like it
[10:34.320 --> 10:42.880]  a lot you know and i'm waiting for the dash lane integration um but like i i i use it i i mean i
[10:42.880 --> 10:48.640]  hate typing in passwords and i and i open and close my laptop like all day long yeah and it's
[10:48.640 --> 10:54.400]  you know it's uh have you set up the thing where you can log into your mac with your watch i
[10:54.400 --> 10:59.680]  haven't i haven't either because i went to do it and it was it seemed like it was going to take
[10:59.680 --> 11:05.680]  like an hour it was like it was like a thing it's like you've got to like turn off two-factor
[11:05.680 --> 11:13.360]  authentication and turn on to something else authentication and it really seemed like more
[11:13.360 --> 11:19.120]  trouble than it was worth especially since i don't wear my apple watch all the time and it
[11:19.120 --> 11:23.440]  just and i use a couple of different max it just seemed like and it was going to be set up on each
[11:23.440 --> 11:31.040]  device and at the same time i knew that i'd be testing the touch bar one soon enough so it's just
[11:31.040 --> 11:35.840]  i never did it and i've heard from people that it's not even that fast if it's not it's cool
[11:35.840 --> 11:41.760]  it works but it's not it may not be as fast as typing the password that i have in muscle memory
[11:41.760 --> 11:45.520]  that you know when i sit down but i'll tell you just logging into the thing with putting your
[11:45.520 --> 11:52.000]  finger up there boy that's great just makes sense and it's like and it's funny just going back to
[11:52.000 --> 11:57.840]  apple not having put this on laptops for years it's like the whole idea of fingerprint sensors
[11:57.840 --> 12:05.840]  and technology really began on enterprise windows laptops right they were terrible they were so bad
[12:05.840 --> 12:11.760]  you'd have to either swipe your finger in like the exact right direction and even then you'd
[12:11.760 --> 12:16.080]  get through like three different software layers that would say like whatever this you know whoever
[12:16.080 --> 12:21.520]  was making the the the fingerprint sensor would have their software then you'd have windows
[12:21.520 --> 12:27.440]  software and apple just fixed that with the iphone right they fixed that with touch id and then the
[12:27.440 --> 12:37.440]  entire android industry followed suit um just like why was it never on laptops yeah um so i you know
[12:40.000 --> 12:48.000]  i i don't blame i i'm not surprised i i kind of i you know circle back i think i wish touch id
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.880]  had come to the macbooks earlier i think this is pretty late but now that it's here i really like
[12:52.880 --> 12:57.920]  it i'm not surprised it doesn't go across the whole line i do wonder how much apple debated
[12:57.920 --> 13:03.600]  internally whether to release that macbook escape at all i can't help but think that that was a
[13:03.600 --> 13:13.440]  discussion it just it's like why it's it's a weird it's a weird product and it's very confusing it i
[13:13.440 --> 13:22.800]  think if that product had either been 300 cheaper right let's say well then that would be like
[13:22.800 --> 13:28.400]  right up against the macbook and that would be confusing um the whole lineup is very confusing
[13:28.400 --> 13:33.360]  to me but well not really the not the whole lineup is very confusing to me with the old models and
[13:33.360 --> 13:39.600]  then with that 13 the new 13 inch no touch bar it's very confusing to me why i think if that
[13:39.600 --> 13:45.200]  product didn't exist it might be a little bit easier or if the price was dropped my guess is
[13:45.200 --> 13:54.400]  is that it's because they this is my best guess is that they clearly for the last few years quite a
[13:54.400 --> 14:02.800]  few years they don't significantly change their mac hardware on a regular basis like i think we
[14:02.800 --> 14:08.480]  can safely assume that these new macbook pros are what the macbook pros are going to look like for
[14:08.480 --> 14:15.440]  at least three years probably four forever yeah for a long time and at the most the most they
[14:15.440 --> 14:21.360]  might do would be add new like anodization finishes maybe totally maybe add a gold one
[14:21.360 --> 14:28.160]  or something like that or a new version of black or something like that right um and so i kind of
[14:28.160 --> 14:36.320]  feel that that fifteen hundred dollar macbook escape isn't really there to sell in great numbers
[14:36.320 --> 14:43.040]  right now but it's there because it'll you know six months from now or a year from now it will
[14:43.040 --> 14:47.840]  move down you know it'll be thirteen hundred dollars instead of fifteen hundred dollars a
[14:47.840 --> 14:52.080]  year from now and maybe technically unchanged like yes they'll do the thing where they don't
[14:52.080 --> 14:58.480]  change any of the um yes any of the internals and eventually it'll be like a twelve hundred eleven
[14:58.480 --> 15:05.200]  hundred dollar macbook with you know two usb you know that's a pretty good machine for an
[15:05.200 --> 15:10.800]  entry-level person and maybe that is the machine that goes to to fill the the macbook air void
[15:11.520 --> 15:16.320]  right i mean for now the macbook air sticks around apple's saying it very loud and clear
[15:16.320 --> 15:21.920]  the the macbook air sticks around they know how much people love it um we can talk very we could
[15:21.920 --> 15:26.400]  talk about some of us who have have considered stocking up on the macbook air because we think
[15:26.400 --> 15:32.800]  it might be taken away at some point um but maybe that is that's the thought process right like
[15:32.800 --> 15:38.880]  if in my mind right and for someone who's constantly asked about laptops uh less less so
[15:39.440 --> 15:47.280]  more you know recently but um if the no touch bar 13-inch what is it called the escape the macbook
[15:47.280 --> 15:53.360]  is macbook pro escape was let's say a thousand dollars i think it's gonna be a while before it
[15:53.360 --> 16:00.640]  gets a thousand i agree i agree agree but if it was i would have it would be a great system for
[16:00.640 --> 16:08.320]  students right put aside the dongle situation it would be a good it would be a great recommendation
[16:08.320 --> 16:13.920]  for students right um and price is part of it but also you know all the other things that
[16:13.920 --> 16:20.320]  add to it right it would be great if it had touch id so okay so let's say it comes down to 1200 like
[16:20.320 --> 16:26.320]  you're saying or 1300 i think it is a much easier sell than it being fifteen hundred dollars
[16:26.320 --> 16:38.800]  uh i also think that it's that the the touch bar um as a whole including you know not just the
[16:38.800 --> 16:45.520]  actual display not just the touch screen but the touch id sensor and the secure enclave and the
[16:45.520 --> 16:51.280]  the stuff that lets that you know it is it you know it really is kind of fascinating at a meta
[16:51.280 --> 16:58.480]  level that it really is an ios computer inside an intel computer you know it's a computer and
[16:58.480 --> 17:04.720]  a computer it's it's a it's an input device that is itself a standalone computer including a display
[17:05.360 --> 17:14.880]  um i think it is a it really is probably a you know 200 to 250 component that the price difference
[17:14.880 --> 17:21.840]  between them it's a significant um it's you know almost certainly you know it's way more expensive
[17:21.840 --> 17:28.160]  than the the trackpad or the keyboard it's a very expensive thing and it's it's not you know it's
[17:28.160 --> 17:32.800]  a pretty simple explanation why they start at 1800 it's because they all you know the ones with
[17:32.800 --> 17:37.600]  the touch bar have a very expensive component at the top of the keyboard totally and i'm and
[17:37.600 --> 17:43.440]  i don't have as big of a problem with the 1800 starting price on the touch bar i mean i i think
[17:43.440 --> 17:51.600]  it's high absolutely um but when you consider that versus the 1300 dollar macbook old macbook
[17:51.600 --> 17:58.560]  pro where that starts um it to me that that one in the middle just doesn't make sense the escape
[17:58.560 --> 18:02.960]  macbook pro yeah i have a hard time recommending i really would you know even the fact that it
[18:02.960 --> 18:08.960]  only has two ports instead of four right that's the one that if there's one thing as the weeks
[18:08.960 --> 18:16.400]  go by that irks me the most about that is that it doesn't have the usb-c ports on the other side
[18:17.200 --> 18:22.000]  yeah at fifteen hundred dollars it seems to me i understand i really do understand why it doesn't
[18:22.000 --> 18:27.440]  have even the touch id because i think that you can't really separate the touch id from the fact
[18:27.440 --> 18:31.200]  that it's this whole you know it doesn't make sense to do a very like the to have touch id you'd
[18:31.200 --> 18:35.840]  still have to have an ios device it would just be an ios device without the touch screen thing but
[18:35.840 --> 18:41.040]  it would still have to have a miniature ios device to have the secure enclave and and all of that
[18:41.040 --> 18:48.560]  i don't think it'd be worth it for them to do the engineering to make it i see yeah um but so but
[18:48.560 --> 18:53.680]  it's for fifteen hundred dollars it's really seems weird to me to cheap out on usb-c ports
[18:54.480 --> 19:00.560]  right yeah i mean like and i'm in this i'm in the place where i want a new laptop right i've had
[19:00.560 --> 19:06.400]  this macbook air for three years now um i have like beat it into the ground it's a great system
[19:06.400 --> 19:10.960]  it could probably you know keep going for someone who doesn't do as much stuff on their laptop as i
[19:10.960 --> 19:16.720]  do and i i don't really know what to get like i keep going back and forth between the old 13-inch
[19:16.720 --> 19:23.520]  pro and the new touch bar um you know and i even ended my review saying maybe i'm holding out for
[19:23.520 --> 19:31.280]  one of these price drops or something um but it seems like odd to me that i still really want a
[19:31.280 --> 19:37.120]  two-year-old computer um and part of it is the ports like part of it is i mean i'm i'm using the
[19:37.120 --> 19:42.720]  mac the new macbook pro with touch bar to podcast right now and i've got two of the uh you know
[19:42.720 --> 19:47.920]  forty dollar dongles out of the sides i've got you know the the one with the hdmi hooked up to my
[19:47.920 --> 19:55.200]  monitor i've got the my external mic plugged in i've got ethernet plugged into the other one um
[19:55.200 --> 20:00.000]  that doesn't this isn't like a typical setup for me but you know that could be one of the things
[20:00.000 --> 20:09.120]  um yeah the sd card slot is a thing for me i don't know um i came here for you to tell me what to do
[20:09.120 --> 20:14.160]  well on the other thing i wanted just wanted to mention is that one of my favorite things about
[20:14.160 --> 20:19.360]  the new one and this is another one of the reasons why i'm i'm kind of annoyed that the that the
[20:19.360 --> 20:24.720]  macbook escape only has the two ports is that one of my favorite things about the new thing is that
[20:24.720 --> 20:31.520]  you can plug the power on either side and it seems like that it's a decent trade-off with losing mag
[20:31.520 --> 20:37.520]  safe i mean it's it's like i i really miss mag that's a good point but being able to plug it in
[20:37.520 --> 20:43.200]  on the right side in a lot of cases is really makes it a lot more convenient there are certain
[20:43.200 --> 20:50.160]  like uh i i don't know why but i always feel like every time i ride the asella between philly and
[20:50.160 --> 20:56.480]  new york and i if i'm lucky enough to get one of those seats with the the table right uh it's a
[20:56.480 --> 21:00.400]  you've done it right and it's a really really it's you know it's nice to have a table but you're
[21:00.400 --> 21:05.280]  facing it's like a it's like like a table right for anybody who doesn't know the amtrak on the
[21:05.280 --> 21:10.240]  east coast there's there's some seats on the asella trains that you you face people on the
[21:10.240 --> 21:15.200]  other side and in between you is a very narrow table but it's really great and if you can get
[21:15.200 --> 21:20.480]  one of those seats and i always feel like every time i do that i i the seat is like means that i
[21:20.480 --> 21:25.600]  have to like snake my power cord around people right it's because you're you're you're like
[21:25.600 --> 21:30.640]  sitting left yes i always am sitting on the left and it would be it would be you know it's not
[21:30.640 --> 21:34.800]  like wow that really changes my life that i don't have to drag the cable around the outside of my
[21:34.800 --> 21:38.880]  computer and plug it in but it would sure be a lot nicer if i could just have it sneak snake up
[21:38.880 --> 21:43.360]  right next to my lap and just plug it in on the right side and that's a really good point like
[21:43.360 --> 21:49.920]  and i you know maybe maybe part of the reason i've always chosen the left side of the bed is
[21:49.920 --> 21:58.560]  because of magsafe that's possible right what if that's true i didn't even think about that but
[21:58.560 --> 22:04.800]  people using laptops in bed it's not my laptop in bed like all the time yeah i'm a phone iphone
[22:04.800 --> 22:11.040]  iphone in bed only and always yeah i mean me too but i like you know if i'm writing late at night
[22:11.040 --> 22:15.920]  and i'm just like i don't want to be sitting at my desk or i'm it's true that's a good point though
[22:15.920 --> 22:22.960]  right side of the bed people have been screwed for forever but in my lap in our last two two
[22:22.960 --> 22:28.000]  apartments i always have chose the left side yeah that's very selfish of you i must say
[22:28.000 --> 22:33.360]  hey well my you know my wife doesn't love magsafe as much as i do i guess
[22:35.920 --> 22:40.720]  she's probably like who cares right right and interestingly like you know usually you pick
[22:40.720 --> 22:44.320]  based on like which side is closest to the bathroom right like that that's usually one
[22:44.320 --> 22:49.680]  of the choices at least for women right um well i guess men too men men pee in the middle of the
[22:49.680 --> 22:55.520]  night oh yeah it's like a thing all the time i don't live with a man so i don't know anyway
[22:55.520 --> 23:01.200]  um and so in this apartment i'm on the left side and that's not even the closest to the bathroom
[23:01.200 --> 23:05.840]  right so i think it is the answer magsafe has determined what side of the bed i sleep on yeah
[23:06.720 --> 23:12.880]  um anyway i still don't know what to do i don't know what to do and i'm just gonna keep just
[23:12.880 --> 23:17.120]  figuring it out and yes we had i had this funny conversation on twitter last night with walt
[23:17.120 --> 23:24.080]  mosberg because apparently on his podcast he mentioned that he has bought and i guess it's
[23:24.080 --> 23:31.760]  a recent it's the newest model of the macbook air and he has this model in the box unused
[23:31.760 --> 23:37.920]  stored in his house till his current one stops working because he's worried apple's going to
[23:37.920 --> 23:45.680]  discontinue it this is this is a thing he's stockpiling and saving up for doomsday of the
[23:45.680 --> 23:50.560]  macbook air and you agreed with disappearing you were like that's a great you're like that's a
[23:50.560 --> 23:56.720]  great genius idea it's like so it's like you've got like it's like a y2k shelter you've got like
[23:56.720 --> 24:03.520]  you know a bunch of canned food well i'm like one i'm one of those people that like if i have a shirt
[24:03.520 --> 24:09.440]  or something that i love i have i will buy a couple of of yeah i'll buy i'll buy a couple
[24:09.440 --> 24:16.320]  versions of the shirt i'll buy like i do that i do that and so i just never really thought about
[24:16.320 --> 24:22.800]  doing it for tech in a way um especially not a laptop that costs over a thousand dollars
[24:23.760 --> 24:28.320]  yeah i don't really have that kind of money where i want to just like save a thousand dollar laptop
[24:28.320 --> 24:34.960]  in my closet to be honest i i chimed in on twitter and i i was like you guys are nuts because i i
[24:34.960 --> 24:41.440]  can't i can't understand back you're right we are we are it's a non-retina screen it looks terrible
[24:41.440 --> 24:46.960]  ben thompson my friend of the show sometimes guess ben thompson had the same feelings where he felt
[24:46.960 --> 24:51.840]  like uh i don't want to put words in his mouth but more or less that the the nice things about
[24:51.840 --> 24:56.400]  the macbook air that you like the keyboard you like the thinness you like the weight you like
[24:56.400 --> 25:01.360]  having a couple of those different ports he bought one too like like i i'm gonna buy one
[25:01.360 --> 25:07.040]  while it's still available opened it up looked at the screen closed it packed it back up and sent
[25:07.040 --> 25:13.200]  it back to apple because he he had forgotten just how crude the non-retina displays are
[25:13.200 --> 25:17.360]  i can't see what there is that is appealing about the macbook air other than the price
[25:17.360 --> 25:23.040]  and i know that it's not like you and walt are are you know limited to thousand dollars i don't
[25:23.040 --> 25:28.000]  i don't see the appeal of it anymore i see no appeal to the current macbook air uh other than
[25:28.000 --> 25:33.360]  price i had none zero zero like if you really wanted to stockpile something if the ports were
[25:33.360 --> 25:38.880]  what's important to you why not get the the 13 inch 13 inch yeah and that's i mean that's what
[25:38.880 --> 25:47.440]  i've said i mean i totally agree i'm not buying another air but um i love this laptop i just like
[25:47.440 --> 25:53.040]  have a special place in my heart for this laptop um and that's like why i yesterday said like i
[25:53.040 --> 25:58.560]  came back to this laptop after two weeks and i was like i could work with this you know i'm not like
[25:58.560 --> 26:04.000]  yes the screen is definitely this big jarring adjustment back to basically seeing pixels all
[26:04.000 --> 26:11.920]  the time um but i just i just love it it just feels like home you know all right maybe maybe
[26:11.920 --> 26:15.520]  a little bit more time with the macbook pro and i could feel a little bit at home i want to take
[26:15.520 --> 26:22.800]  a break but when we come back we should talk about the um the keyboard yeah remind me i'll just be
[26:22.800 --> 26:28.640]  typing loudly here during your first sponsor is uh i love this company and i love their product
[26:28.640 --> 26:40.080]  it's ero e-e-r-o ero uh makes a wi-fi routers little little hockey puck things and they're
[26:40.080 --> 26:46.960]  brand new uh and it's a totally different model it is this is this is a totally different system
[26:46.960 --> 26:53.200]  it's a distributed system they really only make one one type of device typically what you do though
[26:53.200 --> 26:57.840]  is you get a couple of them you place them around your your house or your apartment and they create
[26:57.840 --> 27:05.360]  a distributed system to fill your whole house with wi-fi having just one router somewhere probably
[27:05.360 --> 27:13.360]  in your living room uh really doesn't work for multi-room homes it's if you ever if you've got
[27:13.360 --> 27:18.000]  any spots in your house like a bedroom two floors up which is what i've got that gets yeah like kind
[27:18.000 --> 27:23.360]  of like yeah i got wi-fi but it's like nowhere near as good as it is downstairs uh ero solves
[27:23.360 --> 27:31.680]  that problem and they do it painlessly um kind of right on time with rumors that apple is getting
[27:31.680 --> 27:36.960]  out of the airport business and they haven't updated their airport uh routers in years anyway
[27:36.960 --> 27:41.920]  i have a friend this is anecdotal obviously your mileage may vary i can't guarantee it i have a
[27:41.920 --> 27:50.560]  friend good friend technically uh very very adept uh who just replaced the airport routers in his
[27:50.560 --> 27:56.080]  house with in the ero system and the first thing he noticed when he was doing testing was that his
[27:56.080 --> 28:01.520]  upstream bandwidth went from eight to 24 megabits per second and he was under the impression that
[28:01.520 --> 28:06.000]  eight megabits per second was what he was capped at by comcast he had no idea that there was even
[28:06.000 --> 28:15.120]  more upstream bandwidth to have it tripled by switching to ero um it could not be an easier
[28:15.120 --> 28:21.120]  less technical product to set up this isn't like getting like uh enterprise stuff that you've got
[28:21.120 --> 28:27.360]  to configure in an enterprise you have to sort of put on a network administrator hat to set up no
[28:27.360 --> 28:31.280]  you just get these little pucks they're all the same there's not like you have one that's the
[28:31.280 --> 28:35.280]  home one and then you get these little satellite ones you get like a three-pack you can make any
[28:35.280 --> 28:40.480]  one the main one and put it in where you connect it to your cable modem and then you just take the
[28:40.480 --> 28:44.960]  other two and put them around the house or you you know they're all the same they're very very
[28:44.960 --> 28:50.080]  nicely designed they quite frankly look a lot like apple products they're just very very elegant
[28:50.080 --> 28:56.400]  little pucks um i i i bought i bought the three set for my new apartment no sorry i bought the
[28:56.400 --> 29:01.840]  two set for my new apartment and i was going to say the same thing it just feels like the whole
[29:01.840 --> 29:09.360]  experience feels even simpler than setting up the airport and and it you just wonder like why is
[29:09.360 --> 29:14.560]  apple why i mean i that's a whole other we could turn this into an editor we can roll this sponsor
[29:14.560 --> 29:20.160]  thing right into an editorial discussion we really could because i love ero is at like the top of our
[29:20.160 --> 29:24.960]  holiday gift guide list like it sounds like such a weird thing but it's like you should get someone
[29:24.960 --> 29:29.520]  a router like it sounds like super bad and ero does not pay me anyone who's listening to this
[29:29.520 --> 29:35.520]  ero absolutely does not pay me i never reviewed the eros my my partner jeff fowler did it here
[29:35.520 --> 29:42.080]  but i bought them and and i'm in love with it yep well it's a great product they recommend one for
[29:42.080 --> 29:46.800]  every thousand square feet their default pack is a three-pack that's what i have uh i forget how
[29:46.800 --> 29:51.680]  many square feet my house is but it's probably a little more than a thousand but it's it's
[29:51.680 --> 29:56.480]  absolutely the three-pack fills it up uh if you're lucky enough this is right out of their talking
[29:56.480 --> 30:01.840]  points if you're lucky enough to live in a mansion you can add additional eros up to 10 in total you
[30:01.840 --> 30:07.520]  configure the thing with a really nice ios app so it's right there on your iphone and it's not like
[30:07.520 --> 30:12.880]  you got to log into like a bizarre thing on a web browser that's running on port 80 on the ero just
[30:12.880 --> 30:18.960]  a nice little iphone app i just hook them up connect them once you've actually plugged them
[30:18.960 --> 30:23.600]  into power you've done most of the work it's really it's it could not be if you have an old
[30:23.600 --> 30:27.440]  wi-fi setup in your house you're going to get better performance out of an ero so where do
[30:27.440 --> 30:32.880]  you do to find out more um you go to the wall street journal you go to the wall street journal
[30:32.880 --> 30:37.440]  and read their review just to double check that i'm not full of it uh no just go to the really
[30:37.440 --> 30:42.080]  nice thing about the the wi-fi the app by the way is that you can like keep speed testing and
[30:42.080 --> 30:47.680]  sometimes it like it does the speed tests for you have you know it so i like am obsessed with
[30:47.680 --> 30:52.240]  checking what the speed tests are in my in my house like the like the last speed test it did
[30:52.240 --> 30:58.320]  like the last speed test it did was yesterday and then it lets you know whether hey maybe we should
[30:58.320 --> 31:02.000]  uh jiggle some of the settings because it's you know you're getting worse performance than you
[31:02.000 --> 31:07.040]  were a month ago or something like that it's just it it really is quite frankly an apple-like
[31:07.040 --> 31:11.360]  experience of yeah you don't have to understand it to know how it works just follow these simple
[31:11.360 --> 31:16.800]  instructions instructions and it just works and it looks nice and etc etc so anyway what do you
[31:16.800 --> 31:25.040]  do to get more to get these things go to ero.com and at checkout select overnight shipping and
[31:25.040 --> 31:30.480]  enter the code the talk show and that shipping will be free so as you're listening to this
[31:30.480 --> 31:36.880]  depending on the time of day you can have these eros in your hands tomorrow with no charge for
[31:36.880 --> 31:43.120]  that overnight shipping with that code the talk show my thanks to ero really i i i am getting
[31:43.120 --> 31:47.280]  paid to say this but i really do mean it i've got them set up in the house and it's it's a
[31:47.280 --> 31:51.600]  it's a better wi-fi network it really is and i am not getting paid to say any of this
[31:53.440 --> 31:57.200]  not even not even my impression of john grouper do i get paid for
[31:58.480 --> 32:02.080]  you know what i thought i thought when that story all right end of the sponsorship read we're done
[32:02.080 --> 32:08.880]  thanks to europe i thought when that news came out that uh german had the report that apple is
[32:08.880 --> 32:15.360]  getting out of the airport base station business whether or not i've heard the sort of conflicting
[32:15.360 --> 32:21.280]  things about that the the you know more or less i the thing i've heard is what i often hear with
[32:21.280 --> 32:26.000]  german stories about apple which is not that he's wrong not that anything he wrote was wrong
[32:26.000 --> 32:30.800]  but that he only has part of the story as part of the story which yeah that's the nightmare for
[32:30.800 --> 32:36.960]  any journalist right and that when the other parts of the story come out it might make what he wrote
[32:36.960 --> 32:43.040]  more sense yeah yeah but also maybe you know not look good now i don't know this is just pure
[32:43.040 --> 32:48.960]  speculation pure speculation um this is not anything i've heard but for example one way
[32:48.960 --> 32:52.560]  that he could only have part of the story right would be if apple comes out with one of these
[32:52.560 --> 33:00.880]  um you know uh speakers alexa type yeah speaker type systems like siri in a box and the siri in
[33:00.880 --> 33:08.880]  a box also acts as a wi-fi base station um it does seem weird to me and i know i said we'll
[33:08.880 --> 33:14.080]  get back to the macbook keyboard but no i like it's irresistible it really does seem weird to
[33:14.080 --> 33:19.920]  me because this this this story about apple getting out of the the router business it does
[33:19.920 --> 33:27.440]  seem weird to me because the apple idea is if you just stick with apple stuff you're probably going
[33:27.440 --> 33:35.200]  to pay more you know for x like and let's say x is a wi-fi base station right the apple's base
[33:35.200 --> 33:42.720]  stations cost more than uh just about any other most other consumer base stations but the the
[33:42.720 --> 33:47.600]  appeal of it is if you stick with the apple stuff it'll all just work and it'll be a lot less hassle
[33:47.600 --> 33:54.480]  to set up and a lot less hassle to keep it going and that is in my experience largely true and
[33:54.480 --> 34:01.600]  to that point right the home if that is the next major one of the next major battlegrounds in tech
[34:01.600 --> 34:06.000]  which it clearly seems to be with these talking speakers that are all about being home and if you
[34:06.000 --> 34:12.560]  look at google strategy there as well wi-fi and helping control that part of the equation seems
[34:12.560 --> 34:17.840]  pretty essential especially when you talk about smart home stuff right it's all on the same network
[34:19.360 --> 34:23.520]  you know there's the there's the privacy of there's the security of the network but there's
[34:23.520 --> 34:28.000]  also the management of the network and that's one thing that people have seemed to always love about
[34:28.000 --> 34:32.320]  the airports i actually have never had one um which is just how simple it is to manage
[34:33.520 --> 34:38.240]  it is very that's the reason i've i've always had them and i've now i've always known that i'm not
[34:38.240 --> 34:42.640]  getting or at least for a couple of years now i've known that i'm not getting the absolute best
[34:42.640 --> 34:49.760]  performance um and one reason i've justified that is i just know that the comcast service we have at
[34:49.760 --> 34:54.240]  the house isn't that great anyway like yeah and we're thinking about moving and it's all just sort
[34:54.240 --> 35:00.480]  of been when we move this is in the back of my mind i thought when we move i'm gonna deal with
[35:00.480 --> 35:06.720]  comcast bite the bullet and get the best comcast service i possibly can and then i'll figure out
[35:06.720 --> 35:11.440]  you know i'll get a wi-fi setup that takes advantage of it um but it just seems weird for
[35:11.440 --> 35:16.640]  me to out for apple to exit that because it doesn't it just seems like they're um
[35:16.640 --> 35:21.840]  once they start making it easy to say well you know i'm not going to buy an apple blank then
[35:21.840 --> 35:27.360]  you start saying i'm not going to buy an apple blank for other things too right that being able
[35:27.360 --> 35:32.080]  to have like hey all of my stuff is apple stuff makes it easy to just say well i'm just going to
[35:32.080 --> 35:38.080]  buy another apple thing because i know it's just going to work right well definitely i like your
[35:38.080 --> 35:44.720]  theory about whatever the you know if they get into this talking speaker race which is
[35:44.720 --> 35:53.040]  seems like they've got to right um that that that device is so core to the home
[35:54.240 --> 35:59.280]  it it i i think this theory of it maybe possibly doing something with the with a network could
[35:59.280 --> 36:06.560]  make sense yeah uh yeah i mean the and and that's that's the other top thing that we have on our
[36:06.560 --> 36:12.800]  holiday thing which is the which is the um the echo and you know amazon now they're what are
[36:12.800 --> 36:18.160]  another one of german's reports is that they'll have some sort of tablet version of the of the
[36:18.160 --> 36:24.800]  echo in the next couple of whatever next couple months or early in the next year um and that makes
[36:24.800 --> 36:29.920]  you wonder you know okay is that because people are then jumping on their phones or their tablets
[36:29.920 --> 36:35.440]  to you know finish up a task or whatever it is and in many cases that's probably an iphone or
[36:35.440 --> 36:41.840]  that's probably an ipad um and apple already controls that other part of the echos that
[36:41.840 --> 36:49.600]  other part of the experience in the home i so that's the if i'm remembering it correctly
[36:49.600 --> 36:54.480]  german's report this could just came out the other day and it was interesting to me at a
[36:54.480 --> 37:01.840]  meta level because i like i like mark a lot and now that he's at bloomberg um and he's you know
[37:01.840 --> 37:06.640]  he's so young he's just getting started i thought when he when he took that job at bloomberg my
[37:06.640 --> 37:13.360]  guess was he's going to expand beyond apple because it just seemed inevitable it doesn't
[37:13.360 --> 37:21.280]  seem justified to have just an apple an apple rumors guy at a at a publication is why why that
[37:21.280 --> 37:26.320]  covers is why did you know the entire industry like bloomberg and here you go he's got a scoop
[37:26.320 --> 37:30.880]  you know just like the scoops he typically gets on apple upcoming stuff he's got one on an amazon
[37:30.880 --> 37:37.920]  product um the gist of it though is that he like a seven inch display built into a speaker
[37:37.920 --> 37:43.200]  i don't know and and i do think it's in some ways it is obviously competitive with tablets
[37:43.200 --> 37:49.920]  where you could just why not just you know put say an ipad pro in your kitchen and prop it up
[37:49.920 --> 37:55.200]  and the ipad pro has you know beefed up its speakers significantly compared to the pre
[37:55.200 --> 38:00.960]  pro ipads i mean it's probably not as good as a standalone speaker system but one of the other
[38:00.960 --> 38:06.080]  things that german haddons report is that this new echo is going to have better speakers anyway
[38:06.080 --> 38:10.320]  because that's sort of the complaint people have about the current echo is that the speakers aren't
[38:10.320 --> 38:15.440]  that great they're they're good for like a novelty device if you think like oh my god i'm talking to
[38:15.440 --> 38:20.880]  a black cylinder this is amazing the speakers are great but then if you start listening to like
[38:20.880 --> 38:26.560]  music coming out of it and you really just judge it as like speakers for playing music it's like
[38:26.560 --> 38:31.840]  eh it's kind of right you know it's like you could get a better probably right speaker in that price
[38:31.840 --> 38:38.320]  range or well they've dropped the prices significantly right i mean i so yeah i i love the echo um
[38:38.960 --> 38:43.920]  you know i did the review of the echo in the home a couple of weeks ago and you know even preferred
[38:43.920 --> 38:49.200]  it to to google's product and speaking of google's also doing an ero competitor right they've got
[38:49.200 --> 38:54.160]  this new google wi-fi which i don't think has actually come out yet i don't think so either
[38:54.160 --> 38:58.320]  they haven't i think it was supposed to but i don't think it has yeah they haven't sent review
[38:58.320 --> 39:03.680]  units and they were going to um you know so it's all this fight of these ecosystems or these
[39:03.680 --> 39:08.720]  companies trying to control the ecosystems we live in especially in our homes now so that yeah
[39:08.720 --> 39:16.000]  the wi-fi thing is interesting uh but it makes me wonder you know and you know and again german's
[39:16.000 --> 39:24.560]  report wasn't that specific but what would be the advantage of a a echo which with like a physical
[39:24.560 --> 39:29.280]  thing that has to be plugged in and is not itself a tablet you know it's more of whether it's still
[39:29.280 --> 39:33.600]  a cylinder or whether it's a rectangle now because it has a display but having a built-in display
[39:33.600 --> 39:42.880]  what would be the advantage of that versus a um a device let's just say i mean if apple made one
[39:42.880 --> 39:47.920]  but that also could serve as an ipad doc and then just use the ipad as the display
[39:49.200 --> 39:54.400]  yeah i mean i i would assume that amazon's thinking is that people start something on
[39:54.400 --> 39:58.160]  the echo right and like i just talked to my experience i'll start something on the echo
[39:58.160 --> 40:02.960]  and then realize okay i actually need more information right um and so that i always
[40:02.960 --> 40:08.080]  have my phone i usually have my iphone in the kitchen and so i end up just sort of pulling
[40:08.080 --> 40:12.160]  that out and going and doing whatever i'm not doing that in the alexa app i'm i'm usually not
[40:12.160 --> 40:16.880]  even doing that at all with amazon's assistants whether it's you know searching for something
[40:16.880 --> 40:23.120]  or you know now the new recipe functions things like that i would assume this is more of a ploy
[40:23.120 --> 40:30.240]  to keep people in you know an amazon world but also you know try and move them away from using
[40:30.240 --> 40:35.280]  their their phones i don't know well i the other thing that occurs to me is and i forget if the
[40:35.280 --> 40:40.080]  word kitchen appeared in german's report or not did it or are people just speculating that this
[40:40.080 --> 40:44.720]  is more of a kitchen optimized device so i know i've seen people saying that like the echo is
[40:44.720 --> 40:47.600]  meant to go anywhere and some people have them in their bedroom and some people have in their
[40:47.600 --> 40:52.640]  living room and lots of people including me have one in the kitchen but this this new device with
[40:52.640 --> 40:57.040]  the display is sort of specifically meant for the kitchen and i can think of a couple of reasons why
[40:57.040 --> 41:02.320]  you definitely want to display one of them would be recipes right if you're doing something you
[41:02.320 --> 41:09.360]  know if you're cooking in the kitchen not having a display is almost worthless right it's like who
[41:09.360 --> 41:15.200]  you know it nobody's going to do a recipe by audio right because you'd say you'd have to keep
[41:15.200 --> 41:20.880]  repeating all right how much of this how much of that the new there's a new all recipes app for
[41:20.880 --> 41:26.240]  the echo and it does read out some of the the instructions well i just think though that no
[41:26.240 --> 41:30.240]  no but as a thing to depend on i totally agree like and that that's usually what i end up you
[41:30.240 --> 41:34.640]  know pulling up my phone for which is you know some recipe or something like that well and the
[41:34.640 --> 41:39.600]  other thing that's very obvious and a lot of people for a long time have had tvs in their kitchen
[41:39.600 --> 41:44.960]  you know like mini tvs like when when i was a kid they invented little like eight inch tvs that some
[41:44.960 --> 41:48.160]  people put in their tvs and i thought that was amazing and i wanted my parents to get one and
[41:48.160 --> 41:57.200]  they were like no yeah but it's obvious you know and for as much as there's tons of audio stuff
[41:57.200 --> 42:04.560]  that you can listen to you know like podcasts there's also a lot of people like video and a lot
[42:04.560 --> 42:10.960]  of people like to watch video and guess what amazon has a giant video service that would be
[42:10.960 --> 42:15.200]  you know it to me it's very obvious why they might want to have a display on the thing in the kitchen
[42:15.200 --> 42:20.080]  because it'd be like you just tell tell it you know to play something from amazon prime video
[42:20.080 --> 42:26.400]  and there you are watching it yeah and i mean like part of what amazon also wants you to do is buy
[42:26.400 --> 42:32.000]  more things on amazon and it's very simple now but there are a lot of times where i'm like oh
[42:32.000 --> 42:39.040]  you know i'm uh i'll say alexa add paper towels to my cart or whatever and it usually tries to
[42:39.040 --> 42:44.400]  remember or you know we'll pick what i've ordered before but like having a visual indication of what
[42:44.400 --> 42:50.000]  that is or what i've just ordered or added is is helpful like i never really complete the order on
[42:50.000 --> 42:57.440]  the echo i always end up going to my you know my cart on my laptop or on my um on my phone because
[42:57.440 --> 43:03.920]  you feel more confident if you see it yeah yeah i'm like oh yeah that's the one you know um yeah i
[43:03.920 --> 43:09.920]  mean so it's just you have to wonder what would have happened if amazon had actually had a
[43:09.920 --> 43:16.560]  successful phone years back if if they really i mean i i think honestly it's hard to see that
[43:16.560 --> 43:22.720]  the echo would have come through in the way it has if they had had a successful phone it almost
[43:22.720 --> 43:27.680]  feels like them not having control of the phone and not having a strong presence in people's
[43:27.680 --> 43:34.160]  mobile lives allowed them to create something that was outside of the phone right yeah i think so i
[43:34.160 --> 43:39.040]  definitely think it helped them because it's it was sort of i think the failure of the fire phone
[43:39.040 --> 43:42.640]  was sort of freeing for them and i think the timing of the stuff that they've done since
[43:42.640 --> 43:48.640]  it's sort of you know it's it sort of adds up that from the point where they gave up on the fire
[43:48.640 --> 43:55.920]  they've a fire phone at least they have you know you know it's to some measure or not i mean with
[43:55.920 --> 43:59.760]  as with all amazon products who the hell knows how many they've actually sold because they won't
[43:59.760 --> 44:04.640]  they won't tell you but it certainly seems with the echo that they have some measure of a hit on
[44:04.640 --> 44:11.440]  their hands yeah i definitely think so and i think this holiday like i even though the echo is now
[44:11.440 --> 44:15.760]  two almost two years old it'll be two years old in january which is why i think this new
[44:15.760 --> 44:19.920]  rumor makes a lot of sense i think you know it's probably primed for early next year
[44:21.360 --> 44:26.400]  i think this is the first time that i confidently yeah it really is the first time i've confidently
[44:26.400 --> 44:30.800]  recommended it to most people you know i'm buying one for my parents they just made it they just
[44:30.800 --> 44:35.360]  built a new house and i just think it's perfect for the kitchen that they they made um you know
[44:35.360 --> 44:40.480]  people for for a holiday i've just said this is now like now is the time to get one of these
[44:40.480 --> 44:47.120]  there's there's a it's just the the response time is better the her answers alexa's answers are
[44:47.120 --> 44:53.040]  are mostly on on point uh and compared to especially compared to people's experiences
[44:53.040 --> 44:57.680]  with siri you know you really do get this feeling like people are sort of like they gave siri a
[44:57.680 --> 45:02.640]  chance and then they they stopped giving siri a chance i think that and i've said for for a number
[45:02.640 --> 45:07.520]  of months and almost years now that's apple's biggest hurdle with siri is getting the people
[45:07.520 --> 45:12.880]  even even as siri improves it's hard to get people to go back and try and use siri for things
[45:12.880 --> 45:17.600]  but with alexa right out of the box you're you have this really strong experience you know the
[45:17.600 --> 45:22.080]  response times the answers are right there's not a lot of i'm sorry i have to search the web for
[45:22.080 --> 45:29.200]  that um so i think it's it's going to get more and more people comfortable with talking to to gadgets
[45:29.200 --> 45:35.520]  yeah um yeah i totally agree and i've said that too that the single biggest problem apple has
[45:35.520 --> 45:40.160]  with siri is getting people who felt burned by it to try it again that the first impressions
[45:40.160 --> 45:48.560]  mean so much and the first impression that people have with um uh siri it was so bad for so many
[45:48.560 --> 45:53.280]  people that and and was for a while that they don't they've just given up on it i think the
[45:53.280 --> 45:58.960]  same thing was true going back you know a very long time um and it doesn't matter because it
[45:58.960 --> 46:03.600]  was such a niche product but the newton handwriting was the same way at the end of the newton's
[46:03.600 --> 46:08.640]  lifespan the handwriting recognition was excellent it really was and nobody almost nobody remembers
[46:08.640 --> 46:12.480]  that everybody remembers that part of the reason why the newton failed was that the handwriting
[46:12.480 --> 46:17.120]  recognition was so bad because it was bad when they first shipped it and everybody was like this
[46:17.120 --> 46:21.440]  is amazing a little thing a little computer i can you know almost put in my pocket and i can write
[46:21.440 --> 46:26.000]  on it and you know i got everything wrong at the end of the lifespan it was amazing but it was too
[46:26.000 --> 46:31.680]  late everybody had filed newton handwriting recognition under terrible yeah it's really it's
[46:31.680 --> 46:36.400]  really interesting it's something i've been thinking about lately which is that we're we're
[46:36.400 --> 46:40.880]  early adopters right and many of your listeners are early adopters and so everyone tries all this
[46:40.880 --> 46:46.880]  stuff that's brand new and in the case of what's been going on with with technology over the last
[46:46.880 --> 46:52.320]  couple of years it's like people companies and apple more so than ever i think before
[46:52.320 --> 46:59.040]  releases something that might not quite be done and um gets better over time right especially now
[46:59.040 --> 47:03.360]  in terms of software because software is so much of the experience like the apple watch is the best
[47:03.360 --> 47:09.600]  example i think um certainly the new version is faster because there's a better processor and it's
[47:09.600 --> 47:14.080]  waterproof and there's all these fancy things but you know there's really an argument we made it was
[47:14.080 --> 47:19.200]  better if you waited a year right it was really better if you waited um or even if you waited and
[47:19.200 --> 47:25.520]  bought the old one for for cheaper price because the software got so much better um it's the same
[47:25.520 --> 47:29.920]  thing with the echo um and it's really the same thing with siri and a number of these things but
[47:30.640 --> 47:36.000]  it there's this fear there's this problem if people are early adopters and get a bad
[47:36.560 --> 47:39.840]  get that really bad taste in their mouth and then they just say this thing sucks and then
[47:39.840 --> 47:44.800]  they put it away and they don't sort of keep at it right so it's like almost it's like it's
[47:44.800 --> 47:49.360]  a good time to be an early adopter but it's also a really terrible time to be an early adopter
[47:49.360 --> 47:55.760]  yeah um that's a lot of thoughts let's talk about the new macbook pro keyboard
[47:57.840 --> 48:02.080]  the poor new macbook pro keyboard oh but first it's a good time to take a break i'll take a
[48:02.080 --> 48:07.040]  break and and do our next uh talk about our next sponsor and then we will talk about the the
[48:07.040 --> 48:11.840]  keyboard um i will try not to interrupt you that's all right that was the best interruption ever
[48:11.840 --> 48:20.080]  um this episode is also sponsored by audible.com who has an unmatched selection of audiobooks

[49:30.960 --> 49:36.240]  like they are netflix for audio maybe not even almost maybe that's just a perfect analogy
[49:38.000 --> 49:45.760]  really really great so go there get a 30-day free trial at audible.com slash talk show they always
[49:45.760 --> 49:51.040]  say optional you can recommend a book i will just say the book that i have read over the
[49:51.040 --> 50:01.120]  thanksgiving break i reread reread last year's um uh becoming steve jobs the evolution of a
[50:01.120 --> 50:07.200]  reckless upstart into a visionary leader by brent schlender and rick tesselli this is sort of the
[50:07.920 --> 50:13.920]  unauthorized biography of steve jobs that came out last year that i found way more satisfying
[50:13.920 --> 50:19.920]  and way more interesting and way more insightful than his official biography by uh walter whatever
[50:19.920 --> 50:29.040]  his name was um because it focuses on uh his work and i know that this book sort of there is
[50:29.040 --> 50:34.000]  sort of a skepticism when it came out and people i rolled because it it this book had the
[50:34.000 --> 50:40.400]  participation of people like tim cook and a few others at apple um and people wanted to present
[50:40.400 --> 50:44.960]  it as well this is a whitewashing of of steve jobs's life or something like that and if you
[50:44.960 --> 50:48.080]  read i don't think anybody who actually reads this book would actually say that the book
[50:48.080 --> 50:52.560]  it just happens not to it happens to be a lot less about his personal life and a lot more
[50:52.560 --> 51:01.120]  about his professional life uh early years at apple his uh years out in the wilderness when
[51:01.120 --> 51:07.200]  he was at next and when he founded pixar and then how pixar became a great success and how apple
[51:07.200 --> 51:12.560]  became you know at least to some degree you know i think apple did a little bit better after
[51:12.560 --> 51:18.240]  him steve jobs came back in 97. uh it's a great great book i've read it this is the second time
[51:18.240 --> 51:23.600]  i read it and uh i couldn't recommend it more they have it they have the unabridged version
[51:23.600 --> 51:29.520]  right there on audible.com so you can use it to listen to 16 hours 21 minutes pretty much like
[51:29.520 --> 51:34.880]  a long episode of of the talk show so there you go audible.com talk show and if you want my
[51:34.880 --> 51:44.400]  recommendation give uh becoming steve jobs a listen all right macbook pro keyboard the new
[51:44.400 --> 51:56.080]  keyboard you hear that i i i've i've mentioned this so i while i was doing my review i at one
[51:56.080 --> 52:00.640]  point thought you know what this keyboard is different than what i expected it doesn't feel
[52:00.640 --> 52:05.600]  like the 12 inch macbook keyboard even though it looks the same and it seems to have the same key
[52:05.600 --> 52:10.320]  travel it didn't feel the same to me at all and then you know apple said on stage that they did
[52:10.320 --> 52:15.120]  something different with these quote unquote butterfly switches underneath the keys uh and
[52:15.120 --> 52:20.880]  i believe it absolutely it it's less squishy and more clicky i would agree and there's like more
[52:20.880 --> 52:28.080]  of a bounce right yeah it's it just feels better it definitely feels better to me okay um but at
[52:28.080 --> 52:33.120]  one point during the review i thought boy i'd like the way this feels better than i feared but
[52:33.120 --> 52:39.120]  is this loud this seems loud and yeah i called my wife and son in at one point and i said listen
[52:39.120 --> 52:43.760]  to this do you think this is too loud is this louder than than the old ones and they were they
[52:43.760 --> 52:47.760]  both convinced me that i was kind of crazy they were like it definitely sounds different but it's
[52:47.760 --> 52:51.040]  not loud and i was like all right well i'll just forget it and i didn't write about it but then
[52:51.680 --> 52:56.800]  when the reviews all hit a couple of people mentioned including you that the yeah the
[52:56.800 --> 53:01.360]  keyboard is that louder and i thought damn i should have written about that because i think
[53:01.360 --> 53:07.120]  i i was onto something so i have a theory that but it's it's hard because i haven't gone back to the
[53:07.120 --> 53:11.680]  macbook but i think you're right i think they fixed a lot with the keyboard i still i don't
[53:11.680 --> 53:17.440]  love it i don't really like it really to be honest but um that i i think i need to move i need to move
[53:17.440 --> 53:23.360]  into the future and and accept that this keyboard is changing but i think because there's this
[53:23.360 --> 53:28.880]  because the keys are flat and when you're moving from a you know a keyboard that had these more
[53:28.880 --> 53:36.160]  raised keys that had more travel you might be hitting the keys harder and i know i think i
[53:36.160 --> 53:39.840]  hit the keys harder especially when i'm like in it and i'm really writing and i'm like this is it
[53:39.840 --> 53:43.600]  you know i've got a great thought and this you know i figured out how to do this i feel like i'm
[53:43.600 --> 53:48.880]  sort of slamming on the keys a little bit more um and so that might be why it's louder
[53:48.880 --> 53:53.520]  that it's it's it's part of my theory i mean i definitely think they it certainly is a different
[53:53.520 --> 53:59.040]  sound than the the regular macbook and if you actually the funny thing is in in my video review
[53:59.040 --> 54:04.880]  i did a first person video uh as i do sometimes with the helmet camera and one of the the whole
[54:04.880 --> 54:11.040]  the video kind of shtick was that i you know i was typing on my laptop as sort of like a you
[54:11.040 --> 54:15.360]  know a diary as i was going through my review process and so we recorded the two different
[54:15.360 --> 54:19.840]  sounds the beginning it opens when i'm i'm typing on my macbook and you hear the sounds of the
[54:19.840 --> 54:24.320]  macbook air sorry i'm typing on my macbook air and you hear the keyboard sounds of the macbook air
[54:24.320 --> 54:28.080]  and then we recorded the sounds of the macbook pro because then i switched to typing on the
[54:28.080 --> 54:34.160]  macbook pro for the rest of the of the piece so and you hear you hear like we i recorded it in
[54:34.160 --> 54:39.680]  our booth here and you you definitely hear the different sounds the question i have is is it
[54:39.680 --> 54:46.400]  louder because i'm hitting the keys with more force or is it just genuinely louder and i can't
[54:46.400 --> 54:50.800]  really think of a scientific test to figure out well i can think of a scientific test but i i
[54:50.800 --> 54:55.760]  haven't done it i i think it is louder and i think but i think i think it's a little bit of column a
[54:55.760 --> 55:00.080]  and a little bit of column b i think it is louder i do think though that i i think i just tend to
[55:00.080 --> 55:08.320]  have a very hard typing style so it's right you know and i think with other people you know have
[55:08.320 --> 55:14.400]  very different you know maybe have a gentler typing style and i think if you were in like a
[55:14.400 --> 55:19.440]  library and you were self-conscious about the noise of your typing if you were thinking about
[55:19.440 --> 55:24.080]  typing softly i don't think that the macbook is going to be a problem i think though that if you
[55:25.200 --> 55:30.720]  you know have headphones on and weren't really paying attention to your typing it could be a
[55:30.720 --> 55:39.840]  problem yeah yeah i mean i don't i feel like i just am typing a lot harder on this computer
[55:39.840 --> 55:45.360]  but maybe i've always typed really hard yeah what's your opinion of the keyboard overall noise aside
[55:47.760 --> 55:51.520]  like you get used to it right like i said in this piece and i know a lot of people thought it was a
[55:51.520 --> 55:55.600]  super harsh line i was like you get used to it you also get used to sleeping on a rock when you're
[55:55.600 --> 56:01.680]  camping right like you know i didn't mean that to be super snarky i guess it came out that way but
[56:01.680 --> 56:05.920]  like you get used to it you know it's like anything that might not be comfortable at first then you
[56:05.920 --> 56:11.600]  just sort of get used to it um and then you kind of learn to like it i like i that's the other
[56:11.600 --> 56:16.000]  thing i went back to my macbook air this week and i'm just like i i missed you you know i i really
[56:16.000 --> 56:21.920]  missed you um but i've but i've written some like i have this also like superstition sometimes where
[56:21.920 --> 56:26.000]  i like work on a laptop and i like if i've done some of my best work on that laptop i'll be like
[56:26.000 --> 56:31.440]  this is a great laptop you know i the laptop made the work great and i i think i've done some really
[56:31.440 --> 56:38.560]  good work on this macbook pro so i really can't say that uh that i don't like you know using it
[56:38.560 --> 56:45.440]  yeah i i would i i don't have a i i don't say that i think it's fine and i i really and i say
[56:45.440 --> 56:51.120]  that meaning that i think all laptop keyboards are a compromise you know that none of them
[56:51.120 --> 56:58.080]  i've never had a macbook or power book or any apple laptop ever that has had a keyboard that
[56:58.080 --> 57:02.800]  i find as nice as a desktop keyboard and on the desktop i'm the i'm the guy who famously still
[57:02.800 --> 57:08.800]  uses a 20 some year old apple extended keyboard too that's super clicky and loud right um although
[57:08.800 --> 57:12.800]  not as loud as a lot of these mechanical keyboards by mechanical keyboard standard it's kind of quiet
[57:12.800 --> 57:19.920]  but it is very quicky clicky and loud compared to modern lower travel keyboards um and i will
[57:19.920 --> 57:26.400]  also add some some wiseacre on on twitter after i made fun of you and walt for stockpiling at uh
[57:27.120 --> 57:33.120]  airport macbook airs said this from the guy who has a closet full of old apple extended keyboards
[57:33.120 --> 57:38.720]  which is true i've i've got at least like four of them in my closet um but my defense on that
[57:38.720 --> 57:42.800]  is that this keyboard they don't make keyboards like this anymore as a keyboard it's if you do
[57:42.800 --> 57:50.480]  prefer it there it's you know there is a reason to stockpile them right right that's the thing i i
[57:50.480 --> 57:56.160]  really do prefer the macbook air or the old macbook air macbook pro keyboard yeah i think i
[57:56.160 --> 57:59.760]  prefer it though only because i'm used to it i think if i spend enough time on the new one i
[57:59.760 --> 58:05.040]  would go back to the i'd go back to this one and i'd be on just i'd be too unfamiliar with it
[58:05.680 --> 58:11.040]  right right yeah it's like anything you get used to it you know um i think there's another thing
[58:11.040 --> 58:16.640]  about the new keyboard that i think and again i think i would completely get used to it but i
[58:16.640 --> 58:23.360]  haven't yet which is that the actual keys are bigger the keyboard isn't bigger but they've
[58:23.360 --> 58:30.560]  reduced the space between the keys and made the keys bigger and for some reason it makes me feel
[58:30.560 --> 58:35.840]  like my fingers are spread out more even though it makes no sense because the center of each key
[58:35.840 --> 58:40.000]  is exactly the same distance from each other as on the old keyboard but for some reason
[58:40.000 --> 58:44.880]  that that subtle difference makes me feel like i have to spread my fingers out more and it's
[58:44.880 --> 58:52.080]  not true but it somehow makes it feel that way yeah i really think i'm just typing on it right
[58:52.080 --> 58:57.360]  now i really think i'm hitting the keys harder because and maybe over time i wouldn't hit the
[58:57.360 --> 59:02.800]  keys as hard if i hadn't i found you know if i hadn't if i don't keep going back to the old
[59:03.360 --> 59:09.280]  keyboard i might get more used to just the regular feel of this and i won't strike the keys as hard
[59:09.280 --> 59:15.120]  the keys as hard um but i think it has something to do with the fact that i keep switching between
[59:15.120 --> 59:19.120]  them all right the other thing that bothers me lastly on the keyboard the new arrow key
[59:19.120 --> 59:25.360]  arrangement and i i don't know why but it's like the instead of being a t shape now they've made
[59:25.360 --> 59:30.560]  yeah the left and right ones full height and i for some reason in the two or three weeks that i
[59:30.560 --> 59:35.920]  was using the new macbook pro i could never get used to that it just took the entire two three
[59:35.920 --> 59:40.400]  week period never got used to it isn't that the same on the macbook too yeah it is it started
[59:40.400 --> 59:44.800]  yeah debuted with the new macbook but i never used the new macbook so it's you know i mean i
[59:44.800 --> 59:49.040]  other than like just kicking the tires in the store in the hands-on area i never like reviewed
[59:49.040 --> 59:56.080]  yeah oh really no yeah i think i kind of got used to i used a macbook for like four four months
[59:56.080 --> 01:00:03.600]  about i used it most of the summer um switching back to my air for sort of heavier work and stuff
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:10.000]  like that um what about the trackpad you do you care that it's ginormous i love it and i don't
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.960]  have any palm i didn't have any palm rejection problems whatsoever i saw a couple of people on
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:21.200]  twitter when they first started getting their their 15-inch macbook pros saying i i you know
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:27.200]  this is unusable for me my my palms keep getting registered as um you know i wonder if they were
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:35.440]  using it at a desk i don't know if they got bad hardware i don't know if their their skin registers
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:40.800]  differently capacity of weird skin or if they you know they got a bum device i don't know but it
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:46.640]  didn't i i kept my eye on it and it didn't seem it doesn't seem to be like a rampant problem it
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:52.080]  was like a couple of people the first few days but i i retested the 15-inch you know and was
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:57.040]  really thought about it and and you know my palms absolutely rest on the trackpad while i'm typing
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:03.040]  and it was never a problem yeah i think i think it's a big thing about what the angle what angle
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:08.000]  you're using the laptop at so i don't have really any problem when i'm using it at my desk but there
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.520]  have been some times where i have it on my lap and i do have the problem or the or the keys or the
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:21.280]  the laptop's raised up a little bit more so my the the bottom of my palm will strike the the the
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:27.520]  trackpad as i'm trying to type like something lower on the keyboard i i don't i find it to
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:34.000]  be delightful and it's you know my personal the the macbook that i own is a 13-inch macbook pro
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.640]  that i guess is exactly two years old and i think it was the last macbook pro that didn't have the
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:46.880]  magic trackpad and you know it's still it physically clicks um and i much prefer the new
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:52.880]  trackpad to the one to the one that physically clicks and especially because it it doesn't work
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:57.680]  as a lever so when you click at the top it clicks just as nicely as it does when you click at the
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:02.960]  bottom yeah i totally agree and that's one thing i hate about going back to the macbook errors that
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:07.680]  it doesn't have the force touch or whatever it's called whatever they call it it's my favorite it's
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:14.400]  it's it seems silly but at this point like i'm not really performance constrained nothing i really do
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:20.720]  on especially on a macbook really strains the cpu that much and and one of the little things i
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:26.080]  thought about was what i've always done when i buy a macbook i don't buy them that often you know i
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:31.680]  try to just get it set it up exactly as i want it and then use it until i can't stand it anymore and
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:37.440]  then get a new one and when i buy a new one i've always just maxed it out just go into the thing
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:44.000]  and upgrade from you know the core i5 to the core i7 you know the top of the line whatever get the
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:50.080]  most ram get the biggest ssd etc i realized i think that if i were buying a new mat or when
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:56.400]  when next i do buy a new macbook pro i'm not going to upgrade the cpu i'm going to probably stick
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:00.720]  with the default because the cpu isn't constraining me at all and i'd rather have the longer battery
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:06.800]  life of the lower powered cpu that i've i think i made a mistake two years ago when i bought the
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:12.000]  highest speed cpu because i don't i i'm not i don't need it i never pegged this almost never
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.080]  pegged the cpu's and but i'm getting i know i'm getting worse battery life because i made that
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:23.680]  decision and and you know what i what was i spent hours benchmarking the old pro the old 13-inch
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:29.760]  pro and the new 13-inch pro and performance wise even though there's a leap in a generation
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:36.800]  yeah there's one generation intel that leap that happens um you really cannot tell the difference
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:41.200]  in the performance the intel performance has basically slowed to a point where you're not
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:48.080]  going to notice much unless uh you're really not going to notice much unless i mean unless you're
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:52.960]  doing things that are more relying on storage and the ssd and the ssd speed was faster but not much
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:04:00.160]  faster for everyday type things um so you know like i've you know people have said oh well
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:04.560]  shouldn't i get the new one because it's faster i don't i don't think the reason to get the new one
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:10.320]  is because of perf well it's not because of perfor processor performance is faster it's graphics
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:14.880]  performance or ssd performance and for the everyday person that's not a ton that they're
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:23.120]  going to see yeah i i i was surprised and i don't know how much of this is just the the constraints
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:27.360]  that apple was under because obviously the touch bar ones weren't ready on day one because nobody
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:32.320]  got a touch bar review unit until like a week or so after the event like leaving the event
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:37.120]  everybody who got a review unit got the macbook escape and you know i think that they were you
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:41.680]  know i think it was simply because they didn't have them to give out yeah totally and when i
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:46.880]  did get the 13 inch the one that i got and i'm guessing they probably gave everybody the same one
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:53.520]  was the core i5 model not the core i7 i don't know this for sure but in my memory every other time
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:58.320]  i've ever gotten review units from apple they just give you the top of the line model yeah i was happy
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:03.600]  they didn't actually yeah me too because it's a typical more typical configuration but i honestly
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:10.160]  wonder in that in this case whether it wasn't just constraints but maybe like that they really think
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:15.920]  that this is the better model because the battery life is so much better that's one of the things
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:20.640]  one of the things that i found that is so much better i'm not gonna buy one right now like my
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:25.760]  two-year-old macbook pro is still it's it's too good and it's there's too many reasons i think to
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:33.280]  wait another year um on you know on upgrading so i'm personally not upgrading to one of these
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:39.120]  one of these models it's just not maybe i should just buy your old one maybe it's got your keyboard
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:46.400]  um but yeah you helped me figure it out i think i finally figured it out if there was my old
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:51.120]  old macbooks if there was a reason to get it it would be the battery life it just so happens that
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:57.600]  when i'm using my macbook pro i very seldom am untethered for that long but if i were that would
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:03.120]  be the number one reason to upgrade because the battery life on the new macbook pro is unlike any
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:08.480]  other macbook pro i have ever used it's just unbelievable i mean i i in my review i mentioned
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:13.120]  keeping it open on my lap during game seven of the world series which was i don't know it was
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:16.880]  like four and a half hours incredibly long baseball game it even had like a rain delay
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:22.400]  and when i got i was done i still had 70 battery life left it was i i've never seen anything like
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:28.240]  that and this was the one with the touch bar yeah 13 inch with the touch bar but the core i5 not the
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:35.440]  core i7 and you know i was on twitter and safari you know the whole game um see i've had varying
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:41.200]  results um and i think it could be some of the apps and apple said that you know some of the
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:47.120]  apps that i i've used are obviously more processor intensive um i'm talking about like tweet deck
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:53.120]  really like tweet deck or i'll use um i mean obviously chrome is a is a really huge battery
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:58.400]  sucker but like you know i've just noticed whether it's tweet deck or spotify both of
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:03.520]  those can have some various varying results but yeah pretty much you know in line with
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:10.880]  with what they've said was with was my results but um i've gotten you get longer battery life
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:16.320]  with the not that we're going to go back and start talking about that 13 inch without touch
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:20.480]  bar but you get longer battery life with that one yeah but not not much you know a couple
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:24.720]  20 minutes but if it's like you're defining characteristic of what you need from a macbook
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:33.360]  it's that's the one to get right uh yeah you want to talk about dongles love talking about dongles
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:40.400]  yeah i i think the dongle thing is so overblown i it is obviously a problem if you get it now
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:44.560]  i mean i would need a bunch there's no doubt about it if my main computer was a brand new
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:49.680]  macbook pro with the touch bar i would be using a couple of dongles right now i would
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:54.880]  you know if if it were my main computer i would i'm at my desk so i would be like you i'd need
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:08:00.480]  one to hook up a display and i i would need a dongle to do it unless i've already bought that
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:06.320]  that lg 5k display which i probably would do if it was my only computer depending on when last
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:14.400]  and i would need one to hook up this microphone because this microphone is it connects to my
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:21.280]  computer by usb a so i would need some kind of dongle to connect that to the usb-c port
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:27.440]  and i would also need one to connect my external hard drives because none of my
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:34.480]  external hard drives are usb-c they're all uh i think thunderbolt and i what else do i have
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:38.400]  i forget i think i might even have one here that's an old firewire one that i have a firewire to
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:43.360]  thunderbolt so i'd have to go no i wouldn't have to i would i might have to because i don't think
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:50.240]  there's a firewire usb-c i'd have to go firewire to thunderbolt and thunderbolt to usb-c yeah i
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:54.080]  have to uh right well that's not what i'm doing with this one i've got the
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:09:00.720]  display port to thunderbolt for my thunderbolt monitor did you see there was a story somebody
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:04.640]  had i think i linked to it on during fireball but somebody on medium had a post where they called
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:10.640]  the new macbook pro a surprisingly great machine for hackers and that it's arguably the most open
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:17.280]  computer apple's ever made and you know just as a you know to synopsize that argument the new
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:25.200]  macbook pros don't have a single proprietary port on them right they've got four open standard usb-c
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:31.440]  slash thunderbolt 3 ports and one standard headphone jack and that's it that's the
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:36.000]  has there ever been an apple computer and a macintosh without a single proprietary port
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:42.880]  i don't think so and i've said this many times usb-c is the greatest port it's a great port
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:49.760]  i think the i think the the the backlash has been i think it's been to some of the
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:54.640]  obviously them cutting out the other ports but i also think that there's this major backlash
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:02.720]  to apple not having this sort of unified port structure and i mean why not you put usb-c on
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:06.400]  the iphone right that was like one of the biggest complaints when when they announced the macbook
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:13.840]  was like okay so now i can't plug my iphone into um into the uh you can't plug your iphone into
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:18.000]  your macbook right you need a different adapter but you also can't plug your iphone into the
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.920]  same adapter that goes into the wall because that's usb-c right and that's i have to find
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:29.200]  that article but it's uh it but part of his argument is as you know sort of a nerdy
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:35.280]  android developer yeah and he's he's got like a nexus 6p as his phone because he uses a nexus
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:39.440]  he just needs to take one chart he just takes his macbook pro charger with him and then he can plug
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:44.240]  his he can plug his phone into it as well which is you know convenient right but that and that's
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:51.520]  a great argument for why isn't apple using usb-c on iphones even for the connector that goes into
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:56.400]  the wall now of course they hadn't had the new macbook pros out yet and of course there's a far
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:00.560]  a far bigger market for people who are buying iphones and it's probably going to piss off we're
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:04.960]  going to hear all the complaints when they do switch to usb-c there oh now i can't use my old
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:10.800]  cord to plug into my you know the new little wall adapter that comes in the box with the iphone we're
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:15.200]  going to hear all of that all over again but you know it's a tough time this goes back to my day
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:19.680]  it's a tough time to be an early adopter there's a lot of transition that's going on i don't think
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:24.480]  they're ever going to switch to usb-c on the iphone or ipad i don't think they're going to
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:31.920]  switch from usb-c on the input on the female input on the iphone or on the ipad because they
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:37.680]  love lightning and now they've made a big to-do about lightning as a audio interface but i do
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:44.000]  think they will switch to usb-c on the adapter that goes into the wall yeah i yeah that's what
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.880]  i think they'll do i think and i again in my review i called them out as a nickel and dime move
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:54.480]  i i think what they should have done is done exactly what google did with the pixel phone uh
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:12:03.680]  is ship both cables in in the box when you buy the new pixel you get a usb-c to usb-c cable
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:11.440]  that's right and you get a usb-a to usb-c cable that's right or just put i mean are we talking
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:15.040]  about which box should they put that in them they should put i think they should put them in the
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:19.040]  iphone i think and and if they you know i don't think it would have killed killed them to maybe
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:24.080]  put that cable in the the two thousand dollar macbook pro box either but i think it really
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:27.600]  should have come with the iphone 7 i think the iphone 7 should should have shipped with both
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:34.400]  cables and i've adamantly said that they should have included the usb-c to usb-a adapter that's
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:40.080]  19 but now nine dollars the same price as the adapter that you get in from the lightning cable
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:45.280]  to the headphone jack in yes the iphone box include that in the macbook pro box yes and
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:50.320]  then everyone will be pretty much okay yeah i it's a nickel and dime move i really think they should
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:54.480]  have included one of those in the box and i know that that you know i've made this argument before
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:59.200]  that shipping the dongles with the device is sort of on apple like but you know what they did it
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:04.480]  with the headphone jack right with the iphone 7 and ultimately i think that was the right thing
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:10.160]  to do i really do it built up a lot of goodwill you know people they should have thought okay it's here
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:15.840]  i got this here i have this article it will be in the show notes it's adam geit gee the new macbook
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:21.280]  pro is kind of great for hackers yeah so i will include that in yeah i saw that show notes yeah
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:26.000]  i mean you know i and i actually ended up writing this dongle piece before the macbook pros came out
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.680]  because i just felt i had this inkling that this was going to be a a big deal uh even before they
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:35.760]  announced them and i you know people were already talking about all the dongle situation around the
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:41.520]  iphone um so i did this piece about this is the year of the dongle and you know actually you know
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:45.360]  these new ports are great so let's not complain about the ports but we can't complain about the
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:50.160]  dongles that kind of stuff and you know i recommended a couple of good options there are
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:54.320]  some really good options you know they're there it's a it's a booming dongle market out there it's
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:59.280]  a great time to be in the dongle business the problem is frankly on us that you were you forget
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:04.400]  them at places and they are annoying right they just like are annoying well or even if you for
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:12.000]  even if you don't forget them or lose them it's did you take the right bag right or you know did
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.640]  you know where do you keep them so that they're always there you know and you buy two sets so
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:22.240]  you have one at your office and one at home um you know and yeah i mean an apple makes money off of
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:27.680]  these there's no doubt apple makes money off of these i think that's secondary to in all of their
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:32.720]  thinking but it's you know it's certainly the fact that they could cut the prices as much as they did
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:39.520]  is true right but i mean by the way in that article that i wrote i it it you're better off
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:47.600]  buying apple dongles right because usbc um has had some issues with the open development of these
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:53.760]  of these you know it depends on which ones you're buying but of of some of the adapters where some
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:59.040]  have fried ports yeah and um you know amazon has a number of them listed there even though
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:05.280]  amazon says they will only carry usbif certified usbc dongles and adapters there are many that get
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:11.360]  through um so you're you really are best buying something that either apple sells in their stores
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:17.680]  or that apple makes themselves i i've it this is an interesting tangent i'm not afraid to go down
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:25.120]  but i it's come up recently where amazon has been found to be selling fraudulent stuff you know like
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:29.680]  apple had a thing where they they you know found that there was a whole bunch of you know supposedly
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:35.120]  first-party apple chargers being sold on amazon are third-party ones and that they're completely
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:41.120]  inferior and you know downright dangerous in some cases in terms of just how shoddily made they are
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:46.640]  um i don't trust amazon for stuff like that anymore i really don't yeah i mean like it was
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:50.480]  funny when i was doing the reporting for the story you know the only the only cables i would
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:56.480]  buy from amazon honestly are the amazon basics amazon branded ones because you know that those
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:02.320]  aren't fake and that's a really good experience with them so when i was doing this dongle reporting
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:09.440]  because i'm a dongle journalist at this point um i so so i spoke to the usbif which is the the
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:17.360]  governing body that controls the standards around usb uh usb-c and usb in general and so they you
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:22.080]  know ran me through how something gets certified right and that they have to meet their specs and
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:26.400]  blah blah blah blah blah and they said okay amazon says that they will only carry things
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:32.960]  that have met that have been um sorry there's not certified because some things haven't been
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:40.000]  certified but meet the requirements of the usbif so the companies don't have to have a usbif
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:46.640]  approval which costs some money they just have to have said we meet these we meet these it's
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:53.120]  basically just you know they they just give their word on it to be honest and so when i i started
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:58.640]  doing some research and i was like i found one product on amazon it looked very sort of it
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:04.400]  looked shady frankly and so i emailed amazon pr and they said yeah we don't we they say that this
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:12.400]  meets the usbif certification but more than that we don't really know right so you're in this place
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:16.800]  where you're like okay amazon says yes we do this and they have it listed on their site in
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:24.400]  this dongle article i link to their policy um but there's really no assurance that they really do
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:29.600]  meet that and so you know my advice and and the one i do recommend here i spoke to the company
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:35.200]  they said yes we do have meet the stats i or we do meet the certification or the requirements i
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:40.560]  went to the usbif they also said this one is listed um but yeah there's it's more than meets
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:45.120]  the eye you know these dongles are not just it's just cheap pieces of plastic you know there's more
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:52.000]  to it do you ever buy stuff from mono price no i love this company and i've never had a bad
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:58.400]  bad uh product from them is this a segue into an ad no it is not honestly it is an honest just
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:03.440]  endorsement the and i but the truth is i was looking i mean you're like that was a compliment
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:08.480]  you are such such a great segue for the ads for your for your sponsors that sometimes you don't
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:12.960]  really know so i was like is this a not a sponsor i would love to have them as a sponsor but
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:18.480]  mono price is a great company they their their shtick is that the you know that their cables
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:26.000]  and dongles and etc are very low price um but they're also really well made and they make them
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:31.040]  themselves as far as i know all they sell are their own products so you go to monoprice.com
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:38.000]  and search for various cables and they even have like it it's a little it can be a little
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:43.360]  bit confusing where like sometimes um they have like three different tiers and i don't know what
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:48.000]  the names are but there's oh yeah look at this good better and best of the cabling and they're
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.800]  like the one that's the cheapest and then they have ones like uh like i've bought a bunch of
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:58.640]  little real little like uh six inch tiny six inch lightning cables because there's certain
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:04.320]  situations where that's you don't want a big long cable like when i plug a like a mophie battery
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:09.280]  pack into my phone i don't want i don't want a three-foot cable i just want a tiny little cable
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:14.080]  and they have so this company makes them they make them and they're super low priced and they
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:18.800]  have a great reputation for quality but right now in my opinion they don't have a lot of the
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:24.320]  usb-c thunderbolt stuff because i think they're not ready yet you know it's like i feel like by
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:29.120]  this time next year yeah so these and they're all mfi certified yeah and by next by this time next
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:33.280]  year i think mono price is the place you maybe even six months from now mono price will be the
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:39.920]  place to go to get all your you know usb-c stuff that you don't want to pay 39 or 29 from apple for
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:44.560]  but you can't do it yet because i think it's still so new but they have ones like the the high-end
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:51.520]  one has like uh this is like a just a lightning usb-a to lightning adapter and it has like a nice
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:58.080]  braided yeah canvas cable and it even has uh this is the thing i really love about it has a little
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:03.840]  green light on the lightning end so it's sort of like the old yes it's like magsafe yeah it's like
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:08.160]  magsafe which is another thing that i really miss on the new yeah i mentioned that in my review i'm
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:13.280]  just it is maddening not to have the little light uh you know what and for me and you know
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:19.360]  again i'm buying these right now by the way i'm telling you it's a great i again they haven't paid
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:23.600]  me a nickel but i love this company and also they're certified again when i did my dongle
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:28.720]  reporting it really is important to get the certified stuff because it means apple's tested
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:34.880]  it like apple i mean say what you want about buying some of these you know overpriced dongles
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:40.560]  apple tests all of those with their products right um in fact it's funny i just got an update i
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:45.360]  plugged in one of these adapters and it said i needed to update the system for the dongle have
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:53.040]  you seen that pop up yes yes and just an example of like that the two are integrated right so um
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:57.520]  but the mfi you know it might seem like it's a stupid little thing but it's it's important to
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:03.520]  look for yeah it's the same with the usb cif stuff you want to look for that usb if certification
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:08.320]  the other thing that monoprice has their mid-priced ones have like flat cables like a ribbon cable
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:12.400]  instead of a tube and those can be really nice too because they're a lot less likely to get tangled
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:16.720]  up if they're longer uh anyway they make great stuff i love having you're making me want to do
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:22.160]  a column now not on dongles but cables yeah well monoprice cables are great and i love having the
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:26.240]  indicator light and i really miss having it on a macbook and one of the things is that it's it's
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:32.480]  our stupid house the stupid house we live in we have some i don't know who the hell set up these
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:36.560]  goddamn sockets originally and thought it was a good idea but there's way too many of them that
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:41.840]  are set up where they're connected the switches on the wall yeah in places and the only reason
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:47.040]  you'd ever want that is for plugging a light but like in our kitchen there is a light hanging from
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:53.680]  the ceiling like why would anybody put a wall that we have we have sockets that have that are
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:58.160]  you know meant to be hooked up to light switches in positions where you'd never want to put a light
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:04.480]  and it's totally but that means we've got sockets that are sometimes off and i love it you know and
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:08.240]  and there's somebody comes into the room and flicks it but they don't realize that it's not
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:11.680]  and so then you turn it off and you plug something in you're like why is this not charging right and
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:18.160]  the other common scenario for me at least is we you know it's somewhat older house um and some
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:22.560]  some of the sockets are a little loosey-goosey and when you put the heavy macbook charger right
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:27.440]  in the wall sometimes gravity just pulls it out enough where it's not actually in the light
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:33.440]  and having the light actually go on when you plug it into the thing i find to be very very helpful
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:37.600]  because every once in a while i'll plug in the mag safe on my macbook and the light doesn't go on
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:42.960]  and i know it's either plugged into a socket that needs a switch to be flipped or the thing on the
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:48.480]  wall isn't in all the way yeah no i'm with you on on the light especially too i have the same
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:53.760]  situation or sometimes it'll fall out like um well like you know you're pulling at it and it falls
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:58.320]  out or like we you know the when we had the dog and he's younger we would take it we would unplug
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:04.160]  everything um because we don't want him to eat anything um and you know you think you you plug
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:07.280]  in your thing you think it's charging but then it's not charging because you don't see the light
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:11.360]  and i always love the orange to green it's like orange you know it's still charging green you
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:15.600]  know it's good yeah you don't even have to open the thing i really miss that and these uh lightning
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:19.440]  cables from monoprice have those so anyway that's and by the way what we're talking about cables you
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:26.960]  know this griffin griffin makes the the fake magsafe for usbc yeah have you seen it i i've
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:31.280]  tested i didn't write about it it's really not worth it it doesn't look like it's worth it then
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:37.520]  you have this little dongle thing you have another dongle hanging off for usbc you know in the usb
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:40.320]  port and you're just like what the fuck should i do with that thing you know it's just like and
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:44.240]  i've lost it like i don't know where it is right now i mean this office is a mess already but
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:50.240]  so you've lost the dongle for the whatever priced it's like a cable it's a nubbin for your dongle
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:56.720]  yeah it's it it is god bless griffin for for having tried to make it but yeah no griffin
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:01.360]  thank you thank you i'm sorry to be mean to you it doesn't it's not worth it but it doesn't satisfy
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:07.680]  it doesn't it's it's not the same yeah no it's not it's um i plan to send it back thank you griffin
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:14.320]  for sending me this product that i did not like but good work making it um yeah no i'm happy about
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:20.720]  mono price though this is a great great site uh well here's a complaint i've seen and i just did
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:24.960]  not occur to me while i was testing the device but some people have said that with there's you know i
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:33.440]  bought a usb c uh uh thumb thumb drive you know because that's one of the little things that you
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:39.760]  you know you you know being able to plug a thumb drive in it just you know usb a is so ubiquitous
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:44.480]  that it it the first time i really did run into this while i was testing the the macbook i was
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:49.200]  going to transfer just one thing with a thumb drive and i was like oh crap can't do that wow
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:56.160]  that's weird um so i bought a thumb drive that's usb c uh i've seen people say that they have some
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:03.200]  some usb c things probably not the cables but you know like drives or card readers or something
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:08.240]  they need to be powered well but that the problem on the new macbook pros is that the usb c ports
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:12.080]  are too close to each other that they're so close to each other that there are some things that you
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:17.600]  can plug in and it covers the other port or is at least close enough to the other port that you
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:23.600]  can't even plug the cable in well that's that's exactly the problem that i have on the 13 inch
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:29.360]  as we come back to the the 13 inch no escape whatever it's called the macbook no escape
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:32.640]  can we just come up with another name for that i don't really like love the no escape
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:36.960]  anyway no it's not no escape it is the macbook escape escape sorry escape
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:45.200]  on that the ports are close to each other yeah and i have this sd card reader that um has to
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:50.960]  be powered because many of these dongles don't require power to work depending on what you're
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:56.160]  plugging into them and depending how good the dongle is so this is one that's made by hyperdrive
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:26:03.440]  it's a really cheap u uh sd card usb uh usb c sd card reader but you have to plug it it requires
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:14.800]  power and i can't plug in the power because it's blocking the port you laugh at my my life well
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:20.800]  it's yeah but it's part of the thing yeah it is part of the thing i think i bought i bought an
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:26.160]  sd card reader too and now i don't know where the hell i put it i hope it's in my bag right
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:30.720]  it's you know look like as much as people complain about these and it does look silly
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:35.440]  and stupid they complain these are like these are things that people deal with in their everyday
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:41.280]  life you know and maybe some of us more than others like i'm lucky i'm sitting here with
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:47.760]  like a giant bag of dongles you know because i just called them all in when i was doing this
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:53.520]  this dongle piece but um i mean literally it's like 500 worth of dongles if not more
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:57.360]  can i just add one other nice thing about mono price is that with other cables that they sell
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:03.520]  they have some color choices i know and the color choices if you if you if you think about it
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:08.080]  before you place your order you can do some smart things where i what i started doing a few months
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:16.080]  ago is for oh what's the old usb the micro usb right the one that was sort of that's the real
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:22.960]  small the smallest usb connector before usb-c but mini mini is it i think it's micro mini was the
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:27.760]  one that was sort of small but fat well whatever it is the one which one are you talking about
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:32.640]  which the one that's standard on most uh miss android phones that's micro all right that's the
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:38.880]  one so i still i need to have one of those because my kindle charges with that uh and my uh little
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:44.800]  mophie battery packs charge with that um so i whenever i buy those i just buy them in orange
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:49.680]  and then when in my bag it's very distinctive it's not black it's not white the white ones are
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:55.760]  the worst because they could be anything but if i see orange i know exactly what it is and i there's
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:28:01.520]  no confusion it's a great if you have to put like a bunch of cables and stuff in a bag having them
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:10.320]  color color coordinated by type is is this is a genius you're a genius this is truly like the most
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:16.320]  useful information i've ever gotten on anywhere and every ever apples everything white is very
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:22.400]  good for their brand but it is absolutely a disaster for a laptop bag full of cables and
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:27.840]  dongles it is absolutely terrible i'm looking at these colors now i was about to say when you said
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:32.400]  like this site is great and i was looking i was like oh my god i can get this red cord like i
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:37.840]  always wanted a red yeah but if you keep it by port you know you can you know keep your keep
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:44.800]  your stuff logically organized this really is the site it's a game changer game changer this whole
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:50.560]  thing has been a game changer worth every every moment of this conversation all right let me
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:58.320]  segue smoothly into into our third and final sponsor thank you uh of the show it is a great
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:04.000]  one but it's it is it is time sensitive you need to listen to me listen to me now don't don't hear
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:10.000]  me later it's fracture fracture is the photo decor company that's out to rescue your favorite images
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.960]  from the digital ether they take your photos you upload them to fracture and they print them
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:20.080]  directly onto glass and add a laser cut rigid backing so they're ready to display right out
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:27.120]  of the box they even include a wall anchor you just upload your photo pick the size and it's it
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:34.160]  that's it and the quality is terrific i've got a bunch uh i've given a bunch of holiday gifts well
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:39.440]  that's where i'm going with the time sensitive nature here's the thing these things are terrific
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:45.840]  gifts for your family they really really are uh it's a great way to knock off a whole bunch of
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:53.760]  your holiday shopping uh in one fell swoop but you've got to do it now because it's everybody
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:59.280]  else thinks the same thing and these things are all handmade down in gainesville florida
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:06.560]  from u.s source materials in a carbon neutral factory uh but they can't they their peak
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:12.400]  capacity always gets reached and at some point in the next week or two they're going to hit
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:18.800]  the point where they cannot fulfill orders for the holiday season we are recording this on november

[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:09.440]  off i'm not a procrastinator um i might go order uh but mostly i'm going to mono price right away
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:13.840]  yeah uh what else we have i know the other thing is that your column i think it just came out today
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:19.600]  on the spectacles snapchat yeah is it are they called snapchat spectacles are they now snap
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:24.320]  what's the deal with the name change it like the the social network is still called snapchat but
[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:29.920]  the parent company is now snap is that correct okay correct yeah and it doesn't say snapchat
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:34.400]  spectacles on here but everyone's calling that that's what they're like people are calling them
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:39.200]  that because the app is still called snapchat and they only really work with snapchat so it's not
[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:44.000]  wrong to call them snapchat spectacles it's sort of wrong to add like you can't it's not the
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:49.920]  snapchat spectacles it's not you know it doesn't belong to snapchat it would be snaps
[01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:56.240]  spectacles you're my entire connection to snapchat i've i've installed the app i've looked at it i
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:33:00.880]  don't understand it and then you had a column a long while back earlier this year which is what
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:06.240]  the hell is snapchat and it was the first time it ever made sense to me um and that's why i'm here
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:10.560]  you've got a review out of the snapchat spectacles i just before we get into the spectacles i just
[01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:15.520]  want to say i saw this thing on twitter yesterday and i forget who it was i'm sorry if if i know you
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:21.760]  but someone somewhere in my twitter feed someone was talking about um uh that they have a friend
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:27.040]  who has three teenagers and at all they were and over thanksgiving they they were together and and
[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:35.280]  the topic came up that um every time facebook slash instagram copies something from snapchat
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:44.960]  it makes these teenagers more uh brand attached to snapchat that they they know what's going on
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:50.160]  they see it and it makes them rather than make them i'll just use instagram instead of snapchat
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:55.280]  it makes them want to use snapchat more because they see it as the rip-off that it is and and
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:34:04.720]  in specific context of this was that instagram has added a a um a snapchat like feature of
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:11.360]  notifying you when somebody you're communicating with takes a screenshot of one of the ephemeral
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:20.240]  things that you send them right right yeah i mean and the whole stories feature in instagram which
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:25.680]  was added you know a couple months ago is a complete rip-off of snapchat right um you know
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:30.320]  to some degree that really did work because i think it worked for people like you who were just
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:37.680]  like why do i i've already in instagram instagram used to be cool i'm here why should i go learn
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:43.760]  some complicated snapchat thing and then you know instagram went and added snapchat like stuff and
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:48.480]  people are like okay cool yeah i think that it's you know like for the teens that they're every
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:51.760]  you know they use snapchat because all their friends are already on it i don't need snapchat
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:58.000]  because i don't really like that honestly i don't really care that much about the instagram uh
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:03.120]  what do they call it stories i've started checking them out a little bit but i really don't pay
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:10.720]  attention to them anywhere near as much as just my regular instagram feed yeah i mean yeah i i
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:15.760]  i see them up there and i'll like click on them and i'm just like oh okay you know then but then
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:21.680]  you end up seeing like the same photo yeah in some you know in your actual feed yeah so have
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:28.240]  you posted any in there i don't think i've seen that uh like once or twice and then i was like
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:33.120]  why the hell am i doing this it doesn't stick it does not stick for me i've put some in there but
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:40.080]  it's not surprising that you haven't noticed them because it's you know they go away right anyway
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:46.240]  i thought that was just interesting though that at least it it might be it might be giving some
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:50.320]  of the benefits of snapchat to people who haven't signed up for it like me where i'm seeing these
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:54.720]  stories from the people i follow on instagram but it doesn't you know it's not doing anything to
[01:35:54.720 --> 01:36:01.280]  draw teenagers and the people who are snapchat's core market away from snapchat that if anything
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:05.360]  it you know and again it's anecdotal it's one guy talking about his friends three teenagers
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:11.920]  but it's pretty interesting i thought yeah i mean i think it makes sense i think that like
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:18.560]  the and especially the brand's awareness that's happened around these glasses um like the the
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:25.840]  scramble to get them it they have this really strong um you know just for better or worse like
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:33.520]  cool coolness you know um and and i think part of that is like they haven't really caved to
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:40.320]  being this sort of like mainstream place uh like they do have the whole discover thing with all
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:44.080]  the brands and stuff like that and they try and sort of shove that down your face but there's
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:48.880]  still the core of what snapchat is which is you know building these stories or sending your
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:58.320]  expiring photos and videos um yeah i yeah and and and i think since i've written that piece
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:03.600]  the the piece about you know what is snapchat and how to use it i feel like many adults sort of
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:08.640]  either they sort of just were like okay i i get what it is now but i'm not going to use it
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:13.120]  or they've you know they've started to use it and they've sort of just said this is a place where
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:18.000]  there are are younger people and there's stuff to do here and i don't really need to know what's
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:24.560]  happening here right like it's a thing and i don't i get it now but i don't need to know it
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:29.840]  right like it's for me honestly it's like i don't i don't want to hang out in a bar where i'm 20
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:36.480]  years older than everybody else's who's in the bar yeah i don't know that i would go running away
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:43.600]  but i might just you know finish finish one drink and you know i love it for some reason and i have
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:49.200]  a lot of people in here that like our colleagues or friends that are are are similar age to me for
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:55.920]  sure um yeah i mean and but it's like it is random things that you don't really have to
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:38:00.960]  think that much about you know twitter i mean i'm kind of over twitter i need to like get get out
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:07.520]  of twitter for a little bit but um yeah it's just like stuff that you know and the filters are fun
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:13.040]  you know the filters are really fun to play around with um even though now some of them are so
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:19.760]  promotional for some of these companies it's ridiculous um but yeah it's the the glasses
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:25.920]  are interesting because obviously they've done what google glass just never did which was make
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:31.840]  wearing a camera super cool right everyone's such an interesting comparison in so many ways
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:38.880]  from like just a simple design perspective of what they look like uh how much they cost and
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:45.280]  you know honestly i think it really comes down to the fact that okay they announced these spectacles
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:52.080]  a couple of weeks ago but that's not a a vaporware announcement they're out now right i mean there's
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:57.520]  people who have you know the production ones are out in the real world so it's not like you know
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:02.560]  whereas google glass was i forget what google called it but it was you know for the explorers
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:09.040]  program or something like that and they were expensive and they were just so weird and and
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:15.920]  in so many ways everything about it from the how much they cost to what they look like to to the
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:22.800]  envisioned usage of like recording everything everywhere versus these spectacles which are the
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:29.360]  design wise they're so obviously toys right and they're not to be taken seriously in any way
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:34.480]  again maybe that's just the bottom line was that google's google glass was clearly meant to be
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:41.680]  taken seriously and it i couldn't take it seriously but it it was such an earnest device
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:46.560]  whereas these things are just hey have fun with some sunglasses that have take 10 second
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:53.040]  burst videos or you know what i mean totally and i mean as and and i think they're totally awesome
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:57.760]  like even though i was totally frustrated with this experience of trying to get them which led
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:02.560]  to this funny story that i wrote about all these people scrambling to go to these vending machines
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:08.160]  to get these things i mean it's totally insane um they're awesome because they're just so simple
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:12.240]  right and that was the other thing about google i was like they were trying to do all of this stuff
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:17.280]  they were overlaying things they were you know it was all this complicated technology to swipe
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:24.320]  places there was voice control this is just so simple um that you that you just feel like it's
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:29.280]  so easy to capture the moment that you're looking at and the and the point of view video is awesome
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:33.520]  i'm obsessed with it to begin with and and you know being able to like instantly share it
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:39.760]  although the the bluetooth pairing is a a bit of an issue um it just works it's just like super
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:45.360]  easy and and works um but you know it's a lot of hype about something that's really very simple
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:54.160]  uh what's your experience with like like the quality of the video not that good
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:41:00.160]  is is it difficult in low light i mean what are the what are the light is low light is not good
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:04.800]  at all um but like again they're sunglasses so when are you really going to be wearing them
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:11.520]  that much in low light like i you know i i the video my video this week we shot pretty much
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:16.320]  like it's a shot of me on the left hand side with our regular camera and then the shot from the
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:21.280]  the spectacles on the right hand side for most of the video um and i mean obviously the quality is
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:25.840]  just like you can very much see the difference and i you know my first idea for the video was
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:29.440]  like let's shoot the whole video with the spectacles and just when i started watching
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:33.520]  the footage i was like nobody's going to watch more than a minute of this like it's just not
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:40.000]  it's it's it's grainy it's it's some of it's blurry um you know i i saw some people saying
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:45.440]  that they think it's as good as an iphone i don't agree at all even when you export it as hd
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:51.520]  directly from the glasses into the app and then directly to your phone it does not look like a
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:57.120]  an iphone or a good smartphone i think it's a clever design choice to make them sunglasses
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:02.400]  because that it it says this is you know you can use them wherever you want but they're meant to
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:08.400]  be used outside where there's daylight which is a huge difference for you know a camera that has
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:13.600]  you know trouble with you know low light totally and that was the piece that i wrote this week
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:19.040]  which was like um these are really fun and exciting and we should all be like we should be
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:24.400]  excited about this kind of thing it's it's it's an interesting way of of taking uh video and i
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:29.520]  wish you took photos without shoving a phone in your face right in somebody's face and like the
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:34.240]  the clips i've captured of kids who are sort of scared of of the phone or you know sort of back
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:38.880]  away and get a little shy and when when you stick the phone in their face or even my dog my dog
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:43.360]  knows about the phone you know he's always like kind of like pushes it out of the way right he
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:51.200]  doesn't like the phone um that kind of goes away with these but there's still this um there is this
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:55.360]  stigma of being able to record people when they don't know and and you definitely can do that
[01:42:55.360 --> 01:43:00.480]  with these i said in the piece like i've recorded many moments this week that people did not know
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:05.760]  i was recording because you're not holding a phone up and there's this you're the social norms around
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:10.400]  holding up a phone people know you're recording something something weird is happening you're
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:14.640]  sort of staring like there's one situation i'm staring at a barista with these sunglasses on
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:19.440]  and she's like what the you know she's looking at me weird which is good because she she notices
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:25.040]  that something's different but also i don't think she necessarily knew that there was video recording
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:30.560]  um you know maybe she thought i was like shooting lasers in my i don't know what she she might have
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:35.440]  thought but um yeah it's really interesting you know the the piece i wrote was that we sort of
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:41.040]  need to have some rules around wearing cameras um because this is this is just the start of it right
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:49.040]  like the the augmented reality glasses and the headsets are are likely to have cameras um and
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:53.440]  we have to sort of we need to be respectful of people when we when we are putting these things
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:59.760]  on even if they do look like fun cool things yeah especially as they become more and more subtle
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:04.880]  i mean these are you know these right if you're walking around indoors with these it's obvious
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:10.720]  you've got if people don't know what they are they just at least know they're something yeah exactly
[01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:15.520]  but it's not going to be too long before you'll have glasses that could have a camera on them
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:19.200]  where you'd really have to look closely to notice that there's a camera on them
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:25.040]  it's it's not going to be long uh you know and it's not like you know like if you strapped a
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:31.920]  gopro to your head or or like you do on some of your videos when you strap an slr to your head
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:37.920]  and i i tweeted about this yesterday the the spectacles cannot replace that no the the
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:44.400]  technology of my helmet camera is just far too good and the design is far too good for me to
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:48.640]  replace them with these toy sunglasses well it'll happen soon though i mean just look at what
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:55.280]  happened with the iphone right the original iphone nine years ago didn't even shoot video period
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:45:01.920]  yeah which is crazy if you think about it like and i i've looked that there have been several
[01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:05.920]  times over the years when i thought wait am i misremembering that maybe it's not really bad
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:11.520]  video and i go back and it's like nope didn't shoot video uh so it went from shooting no video
[01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:17.840]  to shooting really terrible video to now shooting better video than my than my
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:23.120]  twelve hundred dollar fuji because it has image stabilization on the video and the fuji doesn't
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:29.120]  and does your fuji's shoot 4k not that you probably shoot that for much 4k with your
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:35.360]  iphone but no but if i wanted to i could which is you know kind of amazing right yeah i mean
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:40.880]  it definitely is going to happen and i think glasses are thick are going to be a the next big
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:49.280]  wave of what we see um in this you know whether it be ar vr world um and especially ones that do
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:55.520]  look like very normal glasses that look like you know the warby parkers and and the ray bans
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:02.320]  so these are 130 bucks do you think what what's the word on availability like are they gonna are
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:06.560]  they gonna are they like there's no way that like they're gonna meet demand for the holidays
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:10.960]  well so you're you know how they're sort of selling them in these pop-up vending machines
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:16.640]  yeah yeah so um so that's how i got into this story so i like i wanted to i wanted to review
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:22.000]  these snapchat said no review units you have to go to these these vending machines and so you know
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:27.120]  they started popping up mostly in california a few times i asked someone to go wait in line and there
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:32.800]  were the lines were three or four or five hours deep and people were waiting in the lines and
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:38.880]  not getting them i had a friend who stood out in venice for me um or no sorry santa monica uh they
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:44.880]  were in line for four hours never ended up getting them you know snapchat has done an incredible job
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:51.120]  apple-like job of creating hype around these things um with the lines with the marketing it's
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:57.760]  it's it i mean it's pretty incredible as a user it's totally it's it's the worst it's really bad
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:02.480]  but from when you look at it from a tech company perspective the tech you know industry perspective
[01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:08.720]  i don't know the last time a company has created this much hype around a gadget yeah um other than
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:13.520]  apple right um so they've done that they've really done that with these with these things and then
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:17.920]  and then there's the resale market right because you could only get these uh so i wrote this page
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:21.840]  this front page piece i wrote an a-head for the journal about these people who were going to
[01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:27.920]  insane lengths to get to the vending machines so they could buy the 130 glasses and quickly
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:35.600]  flip them for 10 times the price um on ebay right so i mean again i i really don't think that
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:41.680]  there's any comparison other than to apple totally i mean and it like you know when i was i started
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:45.840]  telling people about this and they're like well isn't aren't the lines basically just like apple
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:50.640]  and you know it's like well they are they definitely are but the scarcity of it and the
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:56.000]  fact that they're only releasing them in these vending machines in random places um you know
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.840]  has created madness i mean imagine if apple did that i mean if apple did that now it would be
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:04.880]  totally madness right you only could get your the new iphone i mean people would probably line up
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:09.920]  for for an apple product like uh one of these probably this usbc dongle if it was some sort
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:13.040]  of special thing you know it only came from certain types of vending machines and it was
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:18.240]  the only thing you could get well maybe the dongle is a bad example but whatever um so yeah they've
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:23.360]  done like this crazy this crazy i mean i said it was you know it's evan spiegel's version of the
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:29.520]  hunger games basically it's just like dropping random vending machines in random parts of the
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:35.520]  country and seeing who who goes to it um but yeah a lot it's a very simple product that's the thing
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:40.480]  at the end of the day it's such a simple product um and it's something that's like the technology
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:45.600]  has been around for years you could buy these cameras you know a hundred dollars on amazon
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:51.040]  for a you know camcorder glasses you know what get these things the only other i i thought of
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:56.400]  another example the other example would be tesla where with the i'm gonna forget the name of their
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:49:03.600]  upcoming mid you know 34 whatever the mid-priced uh sedan is but the s yeah is that it that well
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:08.320]  whatever it's called the whatever the new one that's that's not out for another two years and
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:13.840]  they got so many pre-orders you know that the the it was backed up people were you know signing up
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:18.400]  you know again you don't have to pay the whole price pre-order but tremendous tremendous you
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:26.240]  know get in line buy it sight unseen uh brand awareness right right price wise you know yeah
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:32.800]  130 sunglasses are a little different than a 50 000 car but still it just speaks though to me it's
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:43.920]  a it is a under maybe undervalued by many people a way to measure a brand you know that there's very
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:47.680]  very as you can count them on one hand the companies that can do something like this
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:53.760]  yeah i i mean and you didn't really think snapchat could but they have you know and
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:59.120]  they're gonna ipo soon and um i think it's i mean i think they're a fascinating company i do too and
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:03.520]  i think and again i don't i i'm you know i'm not an expert on them i don't use the service but i
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:08.640]  you know as a i i'm fascinated and i do like reading stories about them and to me the demand
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:15.280]  for these these uh spectacles is excellent uh i think it's excellent news for anybody who's
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:21.360]  involved with the ipo because to me that sort of brand awareness brand trust brand enthusiasm maybe
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:27.840]  is the best way to put it is is a valuable thing and it's the sort of thing that that isn't likely
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:33.600]  to dissipate quickly yeah and i think you know it's funny like we spend what an hour an hour and
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:41.680]  55 minutes talking about laptops right snapchat has no presence on computers none none and even
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:46.160]  less than instagram which at least has a website that is you know more or less meant to be used on
[01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:52.160]  a on a desktop computer and it's you know i make a video series i do one video a week that basically
[01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:56.640]  we do it does go on our platform but it goes on snapchat and we have far more viewers on snapchat
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:51:02.720]  for the for the video than we have anywhere else and um you know the the a that means that whatever
[01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:06.880]  i'm doing is resonating with people on snapchat which is great but it also just means like people
[01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:12.640]  are so hungry to watch these videos in this format and you know like i did that piece a couple of
[01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:17.760]  months ago on vertical video and i hope that there will be some sort of solution down down the road i
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:23.360]  actually you know these these take um circular video which i think is pretty cool um have you
[01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:27.920]  seen that on the yeah but how does that work on the desktop like if you just like oh it just
[01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:33.440]  exports a circle so you like when you open it like in quicktime play or whatever on your mac it just
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:38.400]  plays in a circle yeah watch my video this week because we like watch the video and did you see
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:43.280]  the circles yeah so the circle is actually what you get yeah like the the the shots where there's
[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:46.720]  like the circle on white yeah like there's the circle in the middle and then white on the other
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:52.080]  side so we have like a big polka dot that's how it exports fascinating and then as you're watching
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:56.640]  it the cool thing is as you're watching it on the phone yeah and you can watch watch joanna's video
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:52:01.600]  and you'll see it but as you rotate the phone it just takes a rectangle within the circle so
[01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:07.360]  if you're holding your phone vertically it takes a vertical rectangle within the circle and then
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:12.400]  as you rotate it just you know you never see you never see black bars it always fills the screen
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:18.960]  yeah and the weird thing is like it it's the framing with the glasses isn't great like you
[01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:23.760]  don't really know like that's where you could see like an augmented reality thing being very helpful
[01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:27.440]  in these like if there was a way to sort of be looking at your glasses and say this is the center
[01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:32.640]  of your frame you know or like a you know actually would be really cool if they showed you inside
[01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:37.520]  where the circle really is um because like there are no many shots where i would like take a shot
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:42.880]  at the dog and like half the dog's face was cut off um you know like oh yeah it's like love to
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:48.000]  capture a memory with you know half a child's face in it um but yeah i think like they're just doing
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  really interesting things around video what's interesting like the you know in the piece where
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:58.160]  it was a journal magazine piece and evan spiegel announced that he was making these and renaming
[01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:04.560]  the company snap and he kept saying that the company is now a camera company um it's interesting
[01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:12.000]  positioning i keep thinking the company is much more of a like a tv network or this uh or or
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:19.120]  it's sort of more of like the youtube of of mobile in my in my sort of thinking about it but it seems
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:23.920]  like he's very set on controlling the camera experience and giving people interesting ways
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:30.320]  to use their smartphone or now glasses camera um so it makes you wonder what kind of other camera
[01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:35.040]  products they're going to work on um but given that like today there's news that gopro just
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:38.640]  laid off 15 percent of their workforce so you know great time to be in the camera business
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:45.040]  i i think gopro i i mean it'd be i'm not an expert on that either but i think gopro has always been
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:51.760]  i've always seen them as the next uh flip remember the flip cameras totally totally and uh it's
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:56.000]  i've never and then whenever i've said that to people they're they've had you know no because
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:00.640]  blank blank and it's like i i don't everything you just said to me doesn't make any sense to me
[01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:05.360]  they're exactly like the flip where they you know had a couple of good years because they were ahead
[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:12.720]  of the game but that other you know there's there's nothing to sustain it um i i've already
[01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:18.960]  noticed i see less people with gopros at places like the beach and stuff like that like a couple
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:25.120]  of years ago when no you know it was like the only safe way people felt to you know take photos
[01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:30.240]  at the beach i think now that we have at least splash proof phones i see a lot more people who
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:34.000]  are willing to like you know go knee deep in the water with the phone in their hands
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.480]  to take a picture and you know no longer need to have a gopro i think i actually tweeted that
[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:43.600]  during the one of the event the apple the iphone event it was like this is the worst news for gopro
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:49.680]  right you know this this because i'm that way now like i don't worry about using that i use my phone
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:57.760]  in the shower on election night i i tweeted that i was legitimately in the shower looking at cnn
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:55:04.960]  looking at the eggs i was like oh you know it it's it's really you don't really when it was
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:08.160]  announced that this is going to be waterproof splash if you know it's all this fun stuff we like
[01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:12.640]  and i obviously did a lot of the pool stuff or whatever but there it's just there's this huge
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:19.600]  level of anxiety that just goes away yeah and and especially the beach or the pool or you know you're
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:24.000]  trying you're washing your dog or you're washing your child and you don't really care that the
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:28.560]  gets wet um those were the times you would take out the gopro right i've always been paranoid
[01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:34.400]  about using my phone in the rain honestly i i've always been super paranoid about you know
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:38.800]  scorching a whatever you call it you know ruining a phone by getting it wet even though like the
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:43.760]  headphone jack has pointed it's been on the bottom for a while i don't know but it's you know i feel
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:48.080]  much better now anything else you want to talk about i think we could wrap up otherwise unless
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:54.480]  you have a topic no i think i'm you know so what am i doing about the laptop you're buying your
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:59.920]  old one you're currently no you're not buying my own because i don't want to get a new one yet i
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:02.960]  want to i'm going to hold on to it in front of you yeah because you don't want to have to make this
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:07.600]  decision i mean i'm in the case where i would eat i'm probably going to yeah this is a company
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:15.200]  laptop i might see if we have any old pros hanging around um it's not that it doesn't work it works
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:19.600]  fine but i just need i i need a little bit more i've been doing more video stuff and you got to
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:24.160]  get rid of the non-retinal screen that's the non-retinal screen is the thing it's going to
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:31.760]  wreck your eyes it's going to wreck my eyes i think you got to tell walt walt's got his next
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:39.440]  air all all set for the for the apocalypse you know i by the time he needs it the the next
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:45.120]  macbook pros will be out it's it's he's he's never going to open that box because by the time
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:51.120]  by the time he even would be tempted to it's he's he can get a macbook pro that will you know and
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:57.520]  the dongle situation will be way better there'll be a usb-c everywhere that's true i say you know
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:02.960]  ultimately if you can wait a little bit until the you know usb-c everywhere is a little bit closer
[01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:10.160]  to the truth and maybe even one more generation of these comes out it's probably worth it but if
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:15.280]  you'd you know really are desperate i wouldn't hesitate to just get the the macbook pro a touch
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:22.320]  bar right now if you really need it if you can wait a year i would wait a year yeah i guess i
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:28.640]  wait a year i'm curious when the i mean i don't want to go on a long discussion here but i'm
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:33.360]  curious when because i know it's going to happen is that the macbook air is going to go away
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:39.440]  uh i think the fact that they didn't update it at all is shows that it's going to um
[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:45.600]  it's either going to go away or apple will like start dropping the actual price and sell it for
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:51.040]  like 7.99 instead of 9.99 but i don't think that they'll do that i kind of think that
[01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:55.280]  the mac is a thing that like with the ipad they'll keep dropping the price but i think the mac
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:58.800]  is something where they want to maintain the average selling price and i think that
[01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:05.840]  sooner rather than later the macbook air will truly disappear and the macbook will drop to 9.99
[01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:12.080]  yeah and i think there's a push to i think there's a push to get people to buy those ipad pros
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:17.280]  you know when you look at really what you what you can do i mean it's really the difference
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:21.680]  of an operating system yeah well and the prediction here's a prediction with absolute
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:25.920]  zero sourcing whatsoever i don't have any inside information on this but it's just my gut feeling
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:32.080]  as to how apple does stuff like this is that sometime in the first half of next year i don't
[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:37.360]  know i don't remember when the macbooks the regular 12-inch macbooks got updated last year
[01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:42.080]  i think it was like april or may or something like that yeah um maybe around that time again
[01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:46.000]  they will update them and they will get the touch bar
[01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:55.200]  and the one without the touch bar will remain unchanged and drop in price i don't know that
[01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:59.120]  that's i don't think they'll quite get rid of the air yet but then it's like maybe like within the
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:06.320]  next 18 months that device the macbook without the touch bar will drop to 9.99 and aren't there
[01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:10.880]  some rumors about a new ipad pro oh i think that they'll def i think they'll definitely do that in
[01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:15.280]  march and i don't have any information on that other just my hunch that they're not going to go
[01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:19.840]  that long without updating the ipad pro and they've already got this new what are they up
[01:59:19.840 --> 01:59:27.760]  to now the a10 processor and the iphone 7 whatever they call it yeah a9 a10 whatever uh yeah and
[01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:32.000]  they'll just put but they'll update i think what they'll do is update both ipad pros at the same
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:39.120]  time the big big one in a medium-sized one i hope they update that keyboard the keyboard cover yeah
[01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:48.800]  yeah i i i i never it's all right but it never did it for me yeah it's a good way to get happy
[01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:52.640]  with the macbook pro keyboard though it's true that's true you're like oh this is wonderful
[01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:58.400]  spend some time with that one all right i have a bunch of links in the show notes to your recent
[01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:02.480]  work uh but people can always find you at the wall street journal and then on twitter what's
[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:10.000]  your twitter twitter handle just joanna stern just spell out joanna joanna j-o-a-n-n-a stern
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:15.440]  s-t-e-r-n i always ask people and i should have done it in your in your voice yes
[02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:23.280]  uh it's funny how many times i have somebody on the show who i see on twitter and interact with
[02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:28.880]  on twitter all the time and i completely draw a blank on what their their twitter handle is
[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:31.840]  because it's sort of like phone numbers you know what i mean like once you have them in your
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:37.040]  twitter feed you don't really need to to pay attention to it yeah and twitter doesn't make
[02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:42.080]  it easy to like add names sometimes even that like autocomplete thing doesn't really work that well
[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:46.880]  yeah i don't even honest to god i don't even know my wife's phone number i i think i know it uh
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:50.960]  let me think i think i know it but i wouldn't want to i wouldn't want to bet that i get every
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:58.480]  digit correct because i 99 times out of 100 i i just tap her in the favorites and then like but
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:01.600]  like sometimes like i'll go and pick up a prescription or something like that and they're
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:05.840]  like you know what's the phone number and i have to fish out my phone and like look at her contact
[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:14.720]  and read it yeah i i i think i know my wife's i and i i don't know like immediate family members
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:20.480]  anymore just like i know my home line like my parents home i know my parents and i know like
[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:25.280]  my best friend from high schools yeah i know my best friend from high school's cell phone number
[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:30.480]  but i don't and my home no i don't know my parents cell phone number not cell phone i know my best
[02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:36.560]  friend from high school's home phone number that i haven't dialed in i don't know 20 22 years right
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:40.880]  because he doesn't live there anymore right but i dialed it so many times as a teenager that it's
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:45.760]  like completely burned into my burned into my mind anyway thank you joanna what a great time
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:02:01.520]  talking to you yes you too
