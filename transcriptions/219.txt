[00:00.000 --> 00:06.080]  I got a bunch of funny stories to start the show. Here's one. Saturday afternoon, Jonas
[00:06.080 --> 00:10.700]  and I wanted to go see Ready Player One. He's into video games. We're into Spielberg movies.
[00:10.700 --> 00:15.780]  Looks like it's right up our alley. Our favorite theater is one that's outside the city. It's
[00:15.780 --> 00:22.160]  about a 20, 25 minute drive from Center City, Philadelphia, called the AMC Woodhaven 10.
[00:22.160 --> 00:27.880]  It's a great theater. Somebody out there, when we went to see The Last Jedi there, said
[00:27.880 --> 00:33.540]  are you John Gruber? He's a listener of the show. I forget your name, good fellow, but
[00:33.540 --> 00:39.680]  I remember meeting him and his, I think his girlfriend or wife. It's a really great theater.
[00:39.680 --> 00:46.640]  It's one that you get reserved seats. They're all full recliners. They have a great concession
[00:46.640 --> 00:50.360]  stand. It's not like you'd sit there and wait 10 minutes. It's like they actually want
[00:50.360 --> 00:58.360]  to serve you. They have a bar that serves beer, so you can have a beer and watch a movie.
[00:58.360 --> 01:01.880]  I just love to go there. It's a very clean place. I don't know how many years it's been
[01:01.880 --> 01:07.040]  open, but it still looks brand new. Great projection systems, great sound systems, etc.
[01:07.040 --> 01:12.360]  Anyway, we get there to the AMC Woodhaven 10 and I've got my pre-bought tickets and
[01:12.360 --> 01:18.080]  our perfect seats all picked out from the day before. It was telling me, instead of
[01:18.080 --> 01:21.840]  putting it in my wallet, which is what I've done in previous times, it didn't have that
[01:21.840 --> 01:30.360]  option. They said, just use your credit card in the kiosk. I thought, well, whatever. I'd
[01:30.360 --> 01:35.980]  rather just use my wallet, but what's the difference? It says, are you sure? It doesn't
[01:35.980 --> 01:41.120]  seem like you have any tickets today. I'm looking at my email or the confirmation thing
[01:41.120 --> 01:48.160]  I have and it says two tickets for Matinee. I got the day right, the AMC Woodhaven 10.
[01:48.160 --> 01:54.920]  I have to go talk to somebody. While I'm waiting in line to talk to a guy at the ticket thing,
[01:54.920 --> 02:00.360]  I stare closely at the fine print and it turns out I bought tickets for a Matinee of Ready
[02:00.360 --> 02:15.440]  Player One at the AMC Woodhaven 10 in Michigan. All the geolocation services in the world
[02:15.440 --> 02:21.160]  couldn't save you from that one. I was like, oh, maybe I could just buy tickets for the
[02:21.160 --> 02:28.760]  same showing here. Problem solved. I'm just out 18 bucks. It turns out they didn't have
[02:28.760 --> 02:34.480]  another showing at that theater for like another two hours. I was like, well, I guess we're
[02:34.480 --> 02:41.660]  going home. I will say Jonas was an extraordinary good sport about it. It actually made me feel
[02:41.660 --> 02:52.560]  very good about his disposition and his willingness to accept disappointing news. You know what
[02:52.560 --> 02:57.600]  the problem is? The problem I made was, I made a couple of mistakes obviously, but the
[02:57.600 --> 03:02.040]  problem was in the past, what I've done is I've gone to, I've used the Fandango app.
[03:02.040 --> 03:07.880]  You ever use this app? I searched for a movie and then from the movie, I searched for the
[03:07.880 --> 03:13.880]  theater and I've told this app that the AMC Woodhaven 10 is a favorite, but for whatever
[03:13.880 --> 03:19.000]  reason it still sorts them by location. Like I said, it's 25 minute drive. I don't know
[03:19.000 --> 03:25.800]  how many miles it is, but it's not the closest theater by far to us, to our house. I always
[03:25.800 --> 03:30.520]  have to scroll. So this time, instead of starting by searching for the movie, I started by searching
[03:30.520 --> 03:37.240]  for the theater and that's where everything went south and that's where everything went
[03:37.240 --> 03:42.720]  south. Well, you know, when you, when you launch Safari on Google or anything, I mean
[03:42.720 --> 03:47.560]  you would have used that. I do it for the most part. I've, yeah, I just realized I've
[03:47.560 --> 03:51.480]  got at least one device that's still set to Google as the default. I forget which one
[03:51.480 --> 03:59.040]  it is. It might be my MacBook Pro. So I will, I will say this, not to denigrate your use
[03:59.040 --> 04:04.560]  of DuckDuckGo, which I appreciate and understand why you do, but when you do launch Safari
[04:04.560 --> 04:10.200]  with Google as your default search engine, the first thing it does when you do a search
[04:10.200 --> 04:17.440]  is often ask for your access to your location. And obviously it would, it would just do this
[04:17.440 --> 04:21.600]  on an Android device, on an iOS device. At least you get a warning like, Hey, you know,
[04:21.600 --> 04:24.840]  do you want to share your location? And you're like, no, I'm searching for food to bring
[04:24.840 --> 04:30.720]  my mistress. I'd rather not hit dismiss. But you hit okay. And then of course any search
[04:30.720 --> 04:35.720]  you would have done for Woodhaven Cinemas would have probably most likely turned up
[04:35.720 --> 04:38.960]  the nearest one. Yeah, I even said that to Jonas on the way home. I was like, you know,
[04:38.960 --> 04:44.640]  I was reviewing the mistakes I made. One of them too was not noticing the, um, I should
[04:44.640 --> 04:49.560]  have been suspicious when it wouldn't let me put it in a wallet, but I, I just, I should
[04:49.560 --> 04:54.960]  have known something was up, but who would that theater didn't do digital? The one, the
[04:54.960 --> 05:02.960]  one in Michigan must not have a wallet scanner. Michigan's like 10, 10 years behind. I only
[05:02.960 --> 05:07.820]  say that because one of my writers is in Michigan. I'm sure he'll hear this and love it. I really
[05:07.820 --> 05:11.120]  could not hate me. I'll go to Michigan now. We've, you know, we solved the problem. We
[05:11.120 --> 05:15.360]  wound up going to a later show that afternoon at another theater, closer, closer to home
[05:15.360 --> 05:20.520]  and, and enjoyed the movie tremendously. Uh, I really enjoyed it. So you liked it. Oh,
[05:20.520 --> 05:25.380]  I enjoyed it. I really liked it. I liked it a lot. And uh, okay. Did you see it? Sounds
[05:25.380 --> 05:30.200]  like something you would have. No, I haven't, I haven't seen it yet. Um, I want to see it,
[05:30.200 --> 05:35.440]  but I hated the book so much that I'm trying to like just work myself up to this place
[05:35.440 --> 05:41.640]  where I could sort of watch the movie. I have to basically have, I have to bring two people
[05:41.640 --> 05:45.160]  to the movie after bringing myself and then I have to bring myself that read the book
[05:45.160 --> 05:49.640]  and they'll get, they're going to have different experiences of it. Well, you know, I'm gonna
[05:49.640 --> 05:53.920]  have to bifurcate my logic about it. If it helps. I didn't really like the book. If it
[05:53.920 --> 05:58.700]  helps though, I've seen a lot of complaints that it's too different from the book and
[05:58.700 --> 06:05.840]  Jonas read and very much liked the book and it was an interesting, it was a very interesting
[06:05.840 --> 06:11.880]  post movie conversation with him because he, he liked the movie too, but was, it was like
[06:11.880 --> 06:16.400]  the first time he was really struggling I think with his disappointment that a book
[06:16.400 --> 06:22.140]  adaptation wasn't as faithful as he wanted it to have been. Uh, even though he recognized
[06:22.140 --> 06:26.200]  that he liked the, you know, you know, we talked about why some of the changes were
[06:26.200 --> 06:29.520]  there. Anyway, I won't go on and on about it. Those mixed feelings that many of us have
[06:29.520 --> 06:33.200]  had over the years, many, many times, you know, he's getting that first brush with that,
[06:33.200 --> 06:38.080]  like, Oh, the book came alive in my head and I imagined all these things. And, um, and
[06:38.080 --> 06:43.300]  I hear obviously that, that some of the, the plot particulars, you know, have been movie
[06:43.300 --> 06:48.000]  eyes to us and, you know, broadened or, or, you know, sharp edges, blunt and blend it
[06:48.000 --> 06:53.280]  down to be more, you know, quick and paste well and stuff. Uh, but the minutia is what
[06:53.280 --> 06:57.200]  books are good at, you know, that's, yeah, there's a, there's a, you know, like, I don't
[06:57.200 --> 07:00.040]  think this is a spoiler. There's, there's lots of stuff I could say about it that would
[07:00.040 --> 07:03.800]  be a terrible spoiler. And so I won't, but one of them is that there's, there's a part
[07:03.800 --> 07:09.720]  of the book where the, our, our heroes have to like solve a puzzle of some sort, you know,
[07:09.720 --> 07:20.000]  and in the movie it's a car race. It's like nail on the head, prototypical movie stuff,
[07:20.000 --> 07:24.480]  right? Like when you go, Oh, why didn't you like the movie? Oh, well it dumps things down.
[07:24.480 --> 07:30.080]  How well, instead of, you know, meticulously solving a decades old puzzle, they smash each
[07:30.080 --> 07:35.160]  other in the face with a board until one of them dies. It's, it's effectively like the,
[07:35.160 --> 07:40.880]  like, uh, the cinematic, it's like the cinematic version of Mario Kart, like a more violent,
[07:40.880 --> 07:45.040]  a more violent version of Mario Kart. It's really good. It's a really good car chase.
[07:45.040 --> 07:50.440]  It is very inventive. It's, it's good. Oh, here's my other one. Y'all have to reserve
[07:50.440 --> 07:54.020]  judgment until I see it. All right. Here's my other opening anecdote that I just have
[07:54.020 --> 08:00.600]  to get off my chest and maybe if, if this hadn't happened to me today, uh, I wouldn't
[08:00.600 --> 08:07.320]  be so angry about it, but I, I literally lost a half an hour to this. So I've got a, uh,
[08:07.320 --> 08:13.040]  our family account, we're on Verizon, but I also have a $50 a month prepaid T-Mobile
[08:13.040 --> 08:19.480]  account, which I use in, um, like whatever Android phones I'm tinkering with. Uh, sometimes
[08:19.480 --> 08:23.940]  I'll stick that SIM into an iPhone. I'm always spooked about getting it stuck to iMessage,
[08:23.940 --> 08:27.960]  but you know, it's just so I can have a second phone, you know, seems like a reasonable business
[08:27.960 --> 08:32.380]  expense given the racket I'm in. I got a text, I don't, but I don't check that all the time
[08:32.380 --> 08:36.560]  because I don't, you know, I don't, it's not my daily carry. I don't carry two phones.
[08:36.560 --> 08:41.640]  So I turned it on, uh, over the weekend. It turned out I had a text from last week from
[08:41.640 --> 08:46.760]  T-Mobile saying that the credit card I was using for my prepaid account had an expired
[08:46.760 --> 08:52.680]  expiration date and they need to log in and update it. So I go, you know, put it on my
[08:52.680 --> 08:59.760]  list of crap to do on Monday. I log in and it says your password has expired. You have
[08:59.760 --> 09:05.520]  to create a new password. Passwords don't expire. That's the dumb, right? And they've
[09:05.520 --> 09:10.720]  got these rules and the rules are you have to have at least one letter. You have to have
[09:10.720 --> 09:16.920]  at least one number. You are not allowed to use spaces and it has to be between eight
[09:16.920 --> 09:23.460]  and 50 characters. Those are the rules. Okay. So I start making passwords that fit these
[09:23.460 --> 09:33.100]  rules and paste them in and uh, the two fields and I hit update and it says, uh, nope, that's,
[09:33.100 --> 09:37.000]  that's no good. And I'm like, well, all the rules have, you know, they, the rules turn
[09:37.000 --> 09:41.400]  into green check marks as you type, as you fulfill them. Like once you type the number
[09:41.400 --> 09:47.820]  it changes. Um, and I'm going nuts and it says it just keeps saying the password provided
[09:47.820 --> 09:52.060]  does not meet T-Mobile security policy. So I think, all right, maybe it's content blockers.
[09:52.060 --> 09:56.480]  It's like they're, they're verifying this with JavaScript reload without contact blockers.
[09:56.480 --> 10:00.400]  Nope. Same problem. So I think, all right, maybe it's Safari. I'll go to Chrome. I go
[10:00.400 --> 10:06.480]  to Chrome login and I get the exact same thing and I think, what the hell is going on? I
[10:06.480 --> 10:09.560]  was like, well, it's got to work on an iPhone. If I do it on an iPhone, everybody had, you
[10:09.560 --> 10:13.700]  know, they have to make their password thing, work on an iPhone, go on the iPhone. I start
[10:13.700 --> 10:18.240]  searching the web to see if other people have this problem. Is T-Mobile's website down?
[10:18.240 --> 10:22.060]  But they won't let me do anything else with my account until I set a new password. Like
[10:22.060 --> 10:27.560]  I can't skip this and go to billing. I'm telling you, I spent half an hour on this and I figured
[10:27.560 --> 10:35.840]  out eventually that they also don't allow any punctuation characters, but they don't
[10:35.840 --> 10:38.720]  tell you that. No, they don't tell you have to discover that one on your own. It's not
[10:38.720 --> 10:44.200]  like a fun surprise. It's not listed in the rules and it's not given to you as the error
[10:44.200 --> 10:49.080]  when they let you, they'll let you submit a password that contains a hyphens, right?
[10:49.080 --> 10:54.320]  I got mine, the passwords I was trying, I tried Safari auto-generated password suggested
[10:54.320 --> 11:00.460]  ones have hyphens and the other system I use to make passwords puts hyphens between the
[11:00.460 --> 11:06.060]  words because there's so many systems that don't let you use spaces. I literally lost
[11:06.060 --> 11:10.400]  a half an hour to that and that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard because it's actually
[11:10.400 --> 11:15.320]  less secure. Like they're the ones, the stupid assholes who made me lose 30 minutes and they're
[11:15.320 --> 11:22.680]  the ones with a password system that won't, won't accept punctuation characters. Yeah,
[11:22.680 --> 11:27.360]  we gotta be, you gotta be extra secure. So we expired this password and now we're going
[11:27.360 --> 11:32.280]  to make our passwords easier to guess. It's just crazy. I really thought that I was going
[11:32.280 --> 11:40.880]  to have to like get a new SIM. Just let it expire. I think I have, I'll be honest. I
[11:40.880 --> 11:44.880]  have had bad experiences where it wasn't the same exact thing, but I've had bad experiences
[11:44.880 --> 11:48.760]  with like prepaid and accounts and things like that. So I think I have three T-Mobile
[11:48.760 --> 11:54.560]  accounts because I have abandoned at least one account before because I couldn't get
[11:54.560 --> 12:01.280]  it to do it. And in my case, I think it was, I think it was the iPad auto-generated account
[12:01.280 --> 12:06.760]  that really caused my issues because you know that thing where you get to buy an iPad and
[12:06.760 --> 12:11.580]  it comes with, in the US anyway, it comes with free T-Mobile like 150 megabytes, which
[12:11.580 --> 12:19.600]  is like you open one web page these days. That's it. You're done. It's open google.com
[12:19.600 --> 12:23.240]  with a doodle and it's like, well, that's 150 megabytes. This flash game in the doodle
[12:23.240 --> 12:30.360]  really boned you on that one. But they create that account and you know, you got to enter
[12:30.360 --> 12:34.560]  an email and password and all that or try to log in with an existing. And it's like
[12:34.560 --> 12:37.440]  one of those things where you try to log in with your existing one and then like, as you
[12:37.440 --> 12:40.840]  said, your passwords expired or you haven't logged in forever because I have the same
[12:40.840 --> 12:46.040]  thing. I have a prepaid that I bounce around, you know, and that system really led me to
[12:46.040 --> 12:50.240]  go like, fine, I'll just put in the secondary email address. And now you can't log into
[12:50.240 --> 12:54.400]  that because I've like long since gotten rid of that iPad. It was either an Apple demo
[12:54.400 --> 12:58.860]  or you know, one that I sold or whatever. And so you have a bunch of vestigial T-Mobile
[12:58.860 --> 13:02.240]  accounts hanging out. I don't know why it's T-Mobile. I don't know if I'd have the same
[13:02.240 --> 13:06.840]  problem on other networks, but I already have accounts with those. I don't know, you know,
[13:06.840 --> 13:10.000]  but yeah, it's a weird one. I think they need to work on that.
[13:10.000 --> 13:16.080]  It makes me so bad. Or not. Maybe they like it. Maybe they think it's fun.
[13:16.080 --> 13:22.720]  People are, I mean, people are such bad programmers. I mean, why would you make a system like this?
[13:22.720 --> 13:27.800]  And there's, did you see that T-Mobile tweet chain? No, no. That happened this past week.
[13:27.800 --> 13:31.880]  So that, and I forgive me, I'm not, I'm trying to hang out less and less on Twitter, but
[13:31.880 --> 13:36.460]  I did happen to see it as I was driving by. So I don't have the whole Odyssey. So if there's
[13:36.460 --> 13:39.800]  some followup that's happened in the last day or so, a couple of days, I don't know.
[13:39.800 --> 13:44.720]  But there was basically a chain last week that was started because somebody, somebody
[13:44.720 --> 13:49.520]  said something about their password to T-Mobile and they said, Hey, you, like you, I was on
[13:49.520 --> 13:55.880]  the phone with your agent and they asked me for my password and were able to verify it.
[13:55.880 --> 13:59.680]  You know, and obviously, as you know, most modern companies don't even ask you for your
[13:59.680 --> 14:04.480]  password over the phone. Like they won't, even if you know, you call them or whatever,
[14:04.480 --> 14:09.040]  they'll ask for other verification components, like maybe social, which is ironic or other
[14:09.040 --> 14:13.200]  things, but they, they generally don't ask you for your password, but I guess the agent
[14:13.200 --> 14:19.440]  asked him for his password and T-Mobile was able to verify, the agent was able to verify
[14:19.440 --> 14:24.880]  that that was his password. And so at some point the password was like in plain text,
[14:24.880 --> 14:29.420]  you know, where they could see it, they could not hash, not encrypted in any way where an
[14:29.420 --> 14:32.920]  agent couldn't just look up your password. Well, that's too many people to be able to
[14:32.920 --> 14:40.360]  look up your password, you know? And then they, this thread trundled out and I guess
[14:40.360 --> 14:45.200]  they had boiled down to T-Mobile was storing at least some of the password in plain text.
[14:45.200 --> 14:50.360]  I'm not exactly sure, or even all of it. And the answer that the T-Mobile rep, and I am
[14:50.360 --> 14:55.260]  assuming this T-Mobile rep is now canned, unfortunately, not like I wish it on anyone,
[14:55.260 --> 14:59.360]  but they were responding to this thread, you know, you know how they do with the, from
[14:59.360 --> 15:04.480]  the official T-Mobile Australia, it was Australia, T-Mobile Australia account. And then, you
[15:04.480 --> 15:08.880]  know, with the little dash MC or BR or whatever their initials are, you know, for the support
[15:08.880 --> 15:14.400]  rep. And they replied, and they said, Well, it doesn't matter if your password is in plain
[15:14.400 --> 15:15.960]  text because our security is so awesome.
[15:15.960 --> 15:18.000]  Trenton Larkin Oh, I did see that. I did see I thought it
[15:18.000 --> 15:19.520]  was a joke. This is real.
[15:19.520 --> 15:22.000]  Jay Haynes No, I don't. I mean, it's real. It's why
[15:22.000 --> 15:27.000]  I mean, unless it's an elaborate narrative that I am not wise to, I believe it was real.
[15:27.000 --> 15:30.780]  And people, of course, at that point just exploded. Because at that point, it's no longer
[15:30.780 --> 15:35.160]  about like, trying to figure out the truth of of how much of the password they could
[15:35.160 --> 15:39.040]  see, like, can they only see the last four digits? And is that really secure? Is that
[15:39.040 --> 15:43.920]  a thing anybody should be doing? And then the of course, the dialogue then went right
[15:43.920 --> 15:50.480]  on to, oh, really, you're like, you're claiming to be on hackable. That's your defense. This
[15:50.480 --> 15:53.440]  is a classic stuff. They really need to get it together.
[15:53.440 --> 15:56.480]  Trenton Larkin Hey, I should mention, before I forget, because
[15:56.480 --> 16:03.760]  I keep forgetting every week, there is going to be a live episode of the talk show at WWDC.
[16:03.760 --> 16:11.440]  It will be on Tuesday, whatever day of June that is, at the California theater once again.
[16:11.440 --> 16:20.840]  Top people are working on this right now. I literally top men, tickets are not yet available.
[16:20.840 --> 16:27.320]  But they will be soon. And I'm I know, it's sold out very quickly, the last few years,
[16:27.320 --> 16:32.580]  and that's very exciting. And in a way, it makes me proud. But it also makes me very
[16:32.580 --> 16:36.600]  sad because I realized that there are a lot more people who would like to be in attendance
[16:36.600 --> 16:41.200]  than who will be able to be in attendance. And I'm, we're trying to figure out the best
[16:41.200 --> 16:51.160]  fairest possible way to, to make it, you know, so sorry. But I have no information to, to,
[16:51.160 --> 16:54.760]  to announce yet. And I guess see, and here's the problem. Here's what I'm kind of stammering
[16:54.760 --> 16:59.640]  around is people know that. And what people what people want to know is they don't want
[16:59.640 --> 17:06.040]  to know how to get tickets. They want to know where to, where to go to find out when I'm
[17:06.040 --> 17:10.920]  going to announce how to get tickets. Like what is the thing that they should be reloading
[17:10.920 --> 17:15.560]  constantly all day every day? Yeah, exactly. What should they have a monitor on? Right.
[17:15.560 --> 17:20.980]  And the one year I did it by announcing it in the middle of a like one of the like a
[17:20.980 --> 17:24.720]  regular show. And I thought, well, that'd be fun. It would make people listen to the
[17:24.720 --> 17:29.040]  show. But I think that was a bad idea. I don't think I thought that through all the way because
[17:29.040 --> 17:32.480]  I think it made, you know, people started like, you know, they weren't really listening
[17:32.480 --> 17:37.740]  to the show. They were like dancing, you know, quick download the show and like skip 15 seconds
[17:37.740 --> 17:42.480]  that that that until you get to the part. And so I don't know what I'm going to do,
[17:42.480 --> 17:45.640]  but I'm very sorry about that. But we will try to live stream it. And I think last year's
[17:45.640 --> 17:51.240]  live stream was a pretty successful. So hopefully our expert, you know, with a year of experience
[17:51.240 --> 17:56.280]  under our belt, we'll do even better this year for those who can't attend. Yeah. I mean,
[17:56.280 --> 18:01.600]  the show was great last year. Good venue too. I liked that venue. The loading was a little
[18:01.600 --> 18:04.920]  bit tight in there, but after that, I think everybody had a really good time. Yeah. I
[18:04.920 --> 18:09.560]  have to figure out how to do that too. It seemed like cause it's general admission.
[18:09.560 --> 18:13.360]  And like if there was a problem with last year's show, it was that everybody quick wanted
[18:13.360 --> 18:18.120]  to stand by the doors waiting for that. You know, we let people into the lobby and then
[18:18.120 --> 18:25.000]  we didn't have the theater doors open and it might have been like a soccer riot or something.
[18:25.000 --> 18:27.960]  So I don't know. I don't know how to deal with that. Yeah. But nerds don't riot. So
[18:27.960 --> 18:33.800]  you were fine. Right. That's good. Just used to standing in line. Stand over here. Okay.
[18:33.800 --> 18:39.040]  I always say I've gotten this. I got this last year from the folks, the fine, fine staff
[18:39.040 --> 18:42.780]  at the California theater. And I used to get it at mezzanine in San Francisco when I held
[18:42.780 --> 18:48.440]  it there is after every show they would say, you have the most nicest, politest fans of
[18:48.440 --> 18:55.360]  anybody who's ever been here. So I hope we can keep that up. That makes me very proud.
[18:55.360 --> 19:01.240]  The DF audience. Yeah. Um, you know why I have some, as someone who has some experience
[19:01.240 --> 19:07.080]  in, um, events and live events and ticketing and whatnot. I'm not, I'm nobody's expert,
[19:07.080 --> 19:11.680]  but just a suggestion might be, you might want to release them in batches at different
[19:11.680 --> 19:15.340]  times. Cause I think that's, I mean, I'm sure you know this, but that's like a common thing
[19:15.340 --> 19:19.280]  with dub dub is that people go, Oh, you know, you recently released them at a really convenient
[19:19.280 --> 19:23.720]  time for the west coast, but um, nobody else has a chance. Obviously now it's lottery.
[19:23.720 --> 19:27.880]  So not a, none of that is really applicable, but I don't know if you want to go full lottery
[19:27.880 --> 19:32.040]  at this point, you might end up having better success just to saying, Hey, like, you know,
[19:32.040 --> 19:36.720]  I'm going to release one quarter of the tickets, you know, throughout the day, all day on this
[19:36.720 --> 19:41.040]  day and that way hopefully people will be up and have their coffee and maybe get a chance
[19:41.040 --> 19:44.640]  to buy the tickets. You know, I did that a little bit last year. I think I did two batches
[19:44.640 --> 19:48.000]  of my, maybe I should break it up into more, but, and I made a mistake last year where
[19:48.000 --> 19:56.920]  I broke off the main floor from the balcony. Um, and the main floor ones went first I think.
[19:56.920 --> 20:00.980]  Um, but then I found out from the staff that they would, they would much prefer just general
[20:00.980 --> 20:05.720]  admission and they'll sort people. And so I shouldn't have done that. No. And yeah,
[20:05.720 --> 20:09.920]  they'll load them because that way it creates like a crawl, a log jam with like the people
[20:09.920 --> 20:13.340]  trying to get upstairs down. It makes sense. I will say from people who are in the balcony,
[20:13.340 --> 20:16.360]  I know it sounds better. You would certainly be more exciting. You know, everybody wants
[20:16.360 --> 20:20.600]  to be in the front row or whatever, but, uh, it's a wonderful theater and the balcony is,
[20:20.600 --> 20:26.040]  is really not like a second class seats. It's, it's really beautiful up there. So anyway,
[20:26.040 --> 20:31.960]  yeah, it's, it is a true theater, so it is meant so that the people on the balcony can
[20:31.960 --> 20:37.000]  have a great view and great acoustics. It's really a funny thing. Um, you know, I don't
[20:37.000 --> 20:42.960]  even know if I was the first to have a live show at the WWDC. I'm not trying to get, you
[20:42.960 --> 20:50.840]  know, bragging rights. Um, but I do think I was one of them. Um, and it's really cool
[20:50.840 --> 20:58.360]  now how many podcasts there are during the week at WWDC. ATP is doing one Monday, uh,
[20:58.360 --> 21:05.400]  Monday night. Um, Brent Simmons just announced that, uh, is the Omni show podcast that he
[21:05.400 --> 21:11.000]  does as a, you know, marketing person at the Omni group. They're going to do one, uh, at
[21:11.000 --> 21:15.320]  the, what's it called? The next door conference, uh, right after the state of the union. So
[21:15.320 --> 21:19.800]  right after the state of the union, Monday afternoon, there's going to be a show. I was
[21:19.800 --> 21:24.120]  a bunch of more that relay FM guys have, I don't know, probably dozens of shows throughout
[21:24.120 --> 21:27.520]  the week, but I think that's so cool. And it gives everybody, it gives people who don't
[21:27.520 --> 21:32.680]  have WWDC passes a reason, um, to go to San, you know, feel like you've got something,
[21:32.680 --> 21:36.280]  you know, you're doing something other than just sitting around drinking and eating, you
[21:36.280 --> 21:40.480]  know? Yeah. And there's, there's an ecosystem of events that has grown up around it. As
[21:40.480 --> 21:45.840]  you said, live podcasts, um, you know, the, uh, the fine folks at the layers conference,
[21:45.840 --> 21:49.000]  they post theirs. It was right. I don't know if it's going to be at the same spot this
[21:49.000 --> 21:52.640]  year, but it was right across the street from the conference center last year, which must've
[21:52.640 --> 21:57.120]  been convenient for folks who wanted to bounce back and forth. Yeah. I don't think that the,
[21:57.120 --> 22:03.160]  um, I know layers is happening and it's going to be in San Jose. Um, last I spoke to Jesse
[22:03.160 --> 22:07.400]  charred, I don't think they have the venue nailed down. Like I think it's in the, you
[22:07.400 --> 22:11.320]  know, possibly at the same venue, possibly somewhere else. I don't know, but it's, it's
[22:11.320 --> 22:21.200]  a great conference too. Yeah. Um, uh, why don't we start by taking a break? I'll thank
[22:21.200 --> 22:29.500]  our first sponsor, uh, the wonderful, wonderful people at trace Pontus coffee. Uh, trace Pontus
[22:29.500 --> 22:38.640]  is a family owned coffee farm, uh, in Brazil. And it's been in the family for generation,
[22:38.640 --> 22:46.560]  the race family, our E I S uh, and for decades, or it looks here, here's what it tastes safe
[22:46.560 --> 22:51.360]  for over a hundred years and three generations. So it's the family's been growing premium
[22:51.360 --> 22:55.680]  coffee in Brazil for a very long time, over a hundred years. But until very recently in
[22:55.680 --> 23:01.120]  their deal with trace Pontus, they only sold their coffee in Brazil to local roasters.
[23:01.120 --> 23:04.420]  So this is the first time they've exported. They begun exporting coffee to the United
[23:04.420 --> 23:11.440]  States. You couldn't get trace Pontus coffee from this race plantation until now. Um, and
[23:11.440 --> 23:15.820]  it's really, really fresh here. It's good coffee, but the big difference between a lot
[23:15.820 --> 23:21.040]  of places where you can get like gourmet coffee is, um, a lot of times you buy it and it's
[23:21.040 --> 23:25.040]  a few weeks old already and that makes a difference. Like coffee, even after it's been roasted
[23:25.040 --> 23:32.400]  is a produce. It goes bad, uh, may not go like, like rotten, but it just loses, it just
[23:32.400 --> 23:36.880]  loses some of the freshness. It really does make a difference. Um, so when you order trace
[23:36.880 --> 23:42.400]  Pontus coffee, uh, that's when they, they like, it's not sitting in a warehouse somewhere
[23:42.400 --> 23:47.280]  and then they go grab, you know, your order and send it to you. Uh, you place your order
[23:47.280 --> 23:51.720]  and then they roast some beans and stick them in a bag and you get like the next batch that
[23:51.720 --> 23:55.800]  goes out. So it's super, super fresh and it comes with a date stamp on it. When it arrives
[23:55.800 --> 23:59.560]  at your house, you'll see how just how fresh it is. I just got one sat another shipment
[23:59.560 --> 24:05.560]  on Saturday and it was roasted like three days before three or four days. Um, just crazy,
[24:05.560 --> 24:10.200]  crazy fresh coffee. Uh, and there's two ways to buy it. You can go to their website, trace
[24:10.200 --> 24:19.880]  Pontus, T R E S P O N T A S coffee or no trace Pontus.com slash coffee. Uh, and I'm telling
[24:19.880 --> 24:23.800]  you, it'd be roasted fresh for you, shipped out immediately. Um, and you don't have to
[24:23.800 --> 24:28.160]  choose between varieties. What you choose between with them is the roast light, medium,
[24:28.160 --> 24:31.920]  dark and French roast. Really, really easy. It's so it's like one, they have one type
[24:31.920 --> 24:37.360]  of coffee and they roast it to different degrees based on your taste. Um, but the other way
[24:37.360 --> 24:41.620]  to get it is you can go to Amazon and search for trace Pontus and it'll be the first thing
[24:41.620 --> 24:45.600]  you see. And the stuff from Amazon is it's just, they're just using Amazon as a front
[24:45.600 --> 24:49.280]  end. They still fulfill it. So you still get the same fresh roasted coffee right from the
[24:49.280 --> 24:53.520]  trace Pontus people. It's not sitting in an Amazon warehouse, just an easier way for you
[24:53.520 --> 24:59.680]  to shop if you're already an Amazon customer. Um, and all orders in the U S and I'm sorry
[24:59.680 --> 25:03.640]  for those of you outside the U S but you get free shipping in the U S when you order it.
[25:03.640 --> 25:06.560]  I don't know how they do that. Now here's the special offer they have for listeners
[25:06.560 --> 25:11.480]  of the show. Uh, what you can do is you can sign up for a coffee subscription and you
[25:11.480 --> 25:15.800]  get freshly roasted beans sent to you every one, two or four weeks. Your choice. Uh, one
[25:15.800 --> 25:20.200]  bag every two weeks is perfect for me for one, one coffee drinker who drinks coffee
[25:20.200 --> 25:24.920]  just about every day. Um, and when you sign up for a coffee subscription, you always save
[25:24.920 --> 25:30.140]  10% off every bag. But listeners at the talk show can get an extra 10% off by using the
[25:30.140 --> 25:37.320]  code, the talk show, all one word at checkout. So that means you'll save 20% off every bag
[25:37.320 --> 25:41.880]  in your subscription with that code. Just enter that code at checkout. So go there,
[25:41.880 --> 25:47.700]  sign up for a subscription. Remember that code, the talk show, and you'll save 20% off
[25:47.700 --> 25:51.840]  every bag in perpetuity. So there you go. My thanks to trace Pontos. Go check them out
[25:51.840 --> 26:00.120]  on Amazon or at trace pontos.com slash coffee. Uh, you had quite a week last week. We might
[26:00.120 --> 26:07.600]  as well talk about this a little bit. I guess so. A long story short, you got an exclusive
[26:07.600 --> 26:12.720]  behind the scenes. Uh, I don't even want to, it's not a look. I mean, you spent a couple
[26:12.720 --> 26:18.160]  hours at apple, right? Talking to their, uh, product marketing and their pro tools group.
[26:18.160 --> 26:24.640]  Uh, did you do, was it last week? It was last week when you went, uh, got it all put us
[26:24.640 --> 26:32.120]  together. Yes. Two last Tuesday. Okay. So tell me, you know, tell the story. Yeah. So,
[26:32.120 --> 26:41.500]  uh, the whole premise was that, uh, I was going to be in a room for a bit with, um,
[26:41.500 --> 26:49.080]  for people from apples, uh, which I didn't know at the time, but learned, uh, as I was
[26:49.080 --> 26:55.360]  there, uh, from their pro workflow group. Um, the pro workflow group group is a new
[26:55.360 --> 27:02.440]  group that they've created, um, inside and literally lives in the building, uh, where
[27:02.440 --> 27:08.820]  a lot of their pro products are being, um, sort of designed and built. And, uh, that
[27:08.820 --> 27:15.920]  group is responsible for evaluating professional workflows to figure out ways where apple hardware
[27:15.920 --> 27:21.880]  or software or a combination thereof is sort of not doing what it should or not being as
[27:21.880 --> 27:29.360]  efficient or as effective or whatever as possible. Um, and so the four people, uh, from the group
[27:29.360 --> 27:36.900]  were, um, all basically either hardware or software or oversight or marketing, uh, from
[27:36.900 --> 27:43.160]  that group that kind of looked over, oversaw different projects, uh, to do with their program.
[27:43.160 --> 27:49.640]  And so we talked for a couple of hours and then, uh, went on a little tour of the, um,
[27:49.640 --> 27:54.240]  system that basically, you know, got to see like, Hey, we're, this is, this is how we
[27:54.240 --> 28:01.000]  view, um, how we see pros using logic. And then this is how we see pros using, uh, final
[28:01.000 --> 28:06.000]  cup pro, uh, and then some of the actual facilities where they're, where the pro workflow group
[28:06.000 --> 28:10.620]  is doing their, uh, work flowing. So do you didn't know in advance that this, what did
[28:10.620 --> 28:14.280]  you know it was going to be Mac Mac related? I mean, how much did you know in advance?
[28:14.280 --> 28:19.180]  Um, yeah, I mean, I didn't know a ton in advance besides the fact that yes, it would essentially
[28:19.180 --> 28:26.520]  be some sort of follow on to the year ago round table, um, which you were at, um, where
[28:26.520 --> 28:31.880]  they basically said, Hey, the Mac pro is, uh, not going to work, you know, out as we
[28:31.880 --> 28:38.360]  knew it. Yeah, exactly. At that point. Um, and so we need to restart our thinking on
[28:38.360 --> 28:42.400]  this and kind of start this project over. So they, I knew it was going to be a retrospective
[28:42.400 --> 28:47.400]  on that. So obviously, you know, at that point you kind of go like, Oh, okay, well if it's
[28:47.400 --> 28:52.080]  going to be that, so they're obviously hopefully going to be sharing some sort of information
[28:52.080 --> 28:57.680]  about the status of it, which they did. Um, and then also from there, it's a matter of
[28:57.680 --> 29:01.440]  like, okay, what's the rest of the time going to be? Is it going to be philosophy or whatever?
[29:01.440 --> 29:06.440]  And I ended up finding out who I was going to be talking to shortly before, um, which
[29:06.440 --> 29:10.480]  is always helpful. I always hate going into a room not knowing who it is because it just
[29:10.480 --> 29:16.280]  like a few minutes to, or, or sometime hopefully a couple of days. That's it's to think about
[29:16.280 --> 29:20.320]  what good questions are to ask these people because they don't, they have wildly different
[29:20.320 --> 29:22.760]  jobs. A lot of them can ask the same question.
[29:22.760 --> 29:30.920]  It is standard Apple PR technique not to tell you who you're meeting with. I hate it, but
[29:30.920 --> 29:35.480]  it can be exciting. Yeah. I mean, it's fine. I mean, you gotta be on your toes, you know,
[29:35.480 --> 29:40.800]  you gotta walk in with the, you know, hopefully with your thinking cap on and um, take opportunity
[29:40.800 --> 29:44.480]  of the time to do two things. And one is, you know, get at the truth of what they're
[29:44.480 --> 29:49.300]  saying and get at the, you know, sort of, you know, read their angle and then interpret
[29:49.300 --> 29:54.100]  it in your own way, hopefully. Uh, but then also theoretically you're there to act as
[29:54.100 --> 29:58.920]  an advocate and an avatar for the audience, right? Like that's your job and you don't,
[29:58.920 --> 30:02.520]  you're not there to be like, you know, Oh, what is, you know, what does Matthew want
[30:02.520 --> 30:07.440]  to know about this? Although I do take my time to do that, you know, um, in these interviews,
[30:07.440 --> 30:10.680]  like I'll ask a question. It's like, nobody on earth probably cares about this, but I
[30:10.680 --> 30:14.560]  really do care about this. You know, I find this interesting. I would like to know the
[30:14.560 --> 30:19.400]  answer to this, but then a large majority of the time you want to dedicate to, Hey,
[30:19.400 --> 30:24.440]  if you know, in this case, all these pro users were here, you know, what questions would
[30:24.440 --> 30:28.200]  they ask? What would they want to know about? And you can ask the questions and you won't
[30:28.200 --> 30:33.920]  always get answers or the answers you get won't always be, you know, as revealing or
[30:33.920 --> 30:38.000]  satisfactory as you want. I almost never simply because of the way Apple works and that's
[30:38.000 --> 30:43.680]  fine, but I have, you know, you ask them, right? You, you try not to be an idiot and
[30:43.680 --> 30:48.040]  ask intelligent questions, but also don't, you don't shy away from them. Even if you
[30:48.040 --> 30:54.480]  know that the answers may not be super satisfactory, it's important that they, that they're asked,
[30:54.480 --> 31:01.280]  you know, um, and did you know it was a exclusive that it was you, you were going to be the
[31:01.280 --> 31:06.960]  only one there? Uh, yes, I did know that. Um, they did tell me it'll just be you this
[31:06.960 --> 31:13.800]  time and I said, uh, okay and didn't say anything further in case they changed their mind. I'm
[31:13.800 --> 31:17.780]  curious what they were thinking. I, like I've told you, we talked about this offline, uh,
[31:17.780 --> 31:22.800]  for quite a while. Um, but I think, I think you were a fantastic choice. Uh, and if there
[31:22.800 --> 31:27.720]  had to be only one person to get it, I mean it sincerely. I would rather it be you than
[31:27.720 --> 31:35.040]  me, uh, because I wouldn't want to be responsible for reporting the, everything that went on
[31:35.040 --> 31:38.960]  because it's just, I'm just not good at it. You know, like that's just not what I do.
[31:38.960 --> 31:44.960]  Um, yeah, it's not like that's, that's not what gets you out of bed in the morning. You're
[31:44.960 --> 31:49.760]  like, you're like, I want to, I want to like absorb it and then, you know, kind of the
[31:49.760 --> 31:52.720]  spirit. I think that's your talent is that you're like, I don't, I'm gonna, you know,
[31:52.720 --> 31:55.920]  I'm going to throw my spear right at this point. This is very interesting. And I don't
[31:55.920 --> 32:05.000]  know how you got that story out from an all day at Tuesday briefings with Apple to 8 a.m.
[32:05.000 --> 32:12.160]  Pacific Thursday. You know, a very comprehensive story is out. Like I, I know I would've had
[32:12.160 --> 32:15.880]  like three paragraphs written. I'd, I would, I would still be like looking at, was it rush
[32:15.880 --> 32:20.200]  if there were some typos? Um, I'm ashamed to admit at launch, but you know, what can
[32:20.200 --> 32:25.660]  you do? I only had one person's name is spelled, um, many times in the piece, but I fixed it
[32:25.660 --> 32:29.640]  pretty quick. But you know, it, it is rough sometimes with that, but you know, you just
[32:29.640 --> 32:34.800]  kind of suck it up and do it. I mean the real kink in it is for me like the time that I
[32:34.800 --> 32:42.400]  do that, I love it, but it is, I am in fact stealing time from my, I hate to say this,
[32:42.400 --> 32:45.080]  but like my, I don't know, I don't actually mean that. I'm not going to say that, but
[32:45.080 --> 32:48.960]  like I said, I'm stealing time from my other duties. I was going to say a real job, but
[32:48.960 --> 32:52.920]  that's not true. They're both my real job. But, um, I do run a site, you know, I have
[32:52.920 --> 32:55.980]  a lot of people ask questions about various important things. I mean, they're working
[32:55.980 --> 32:59.880]  on their own important stories about a variety of other things. So it's a balance. I always
[32:59.880 --> 33:03.480]  have to always find myself stealing time from that. And then I was going to Pixar the next
[33:03.480 --> 33:08.720]  day. So I was like, uh, you know, I'll just write this now at midnight.
[33:08.720 --> 33:17.920]  Um, well speaking of Pixar, hold that thought on Pixar. I'll make a note of this. The, the,
[33:17.920 --> 33:23.360]  we have to talk about the fact that one of the lead takeaways from this briefing was
[33:23.360 --> 33:29.000]  that there, they confirmed that the new Mac pro is not going to come out this year. It
[33:29.000 --> 33:35.960]  will come out next year. Um, and I think that took a lot of people by surprise and, uh,
[33:35.960 --> 33:40.440]  it took even more people to get as a major disappointment, you know, that even people
[33:40.440 --> 33:44.400]  who were like, well, I don't know, I know they didn't say 2018, but I sure hope they
[33:44.400 --> 33:50.220]  do. How hard can it be, you know, blah, blah, blah. Um, so it, you know, obviously got that
[33:50.220 --> 33:57.160]  aspect of the announcement, got a lot of attention. Um, but you and I talked about this, uh, last
[33:57.160 --> 34:03.320]  year at the round table, who was there? It was me and you and Lance on off and enough
[34:03.320 --> 34:13.000]  in a freed and somebody else, right? Uh, John Pachowski, John Pachowski from Buzzfeed. Um,
[34:13.000 --> 34:16.240]  and there was a point and I believe, I don't know, did you ever look at the transcript?
[34:16.240 --> 34:20.960]  I, my recollection of this was that you asked a question like they said, Hey, we, you know,
[34:20.960 --> 34:25.080]  blah, blah, blah. We hit the reset button. We backed ourselves into a thermal corner.
[34:25.080 --> 34:33.420]  We, we've, we've got a very compelling pro version of the iMac for pros coming later
[34:33.420 --> 34:39.680]  this year, which we now know is the iMac called the iMac pro. Um, but that we're going back
[34:39.680 --> 34:46.560]  to the, you know, the drawing board on Mac pro and um, you know, and it won't, they said,
[34:46.560 --> 34:49.840]  and it won't, you know, this is something that will not ship this year. And you asked
[34:49.840 --> 34:54.800]  a question that said something about the Mac pro and at this point last year, quote unquote,
[34:54.800 --> 35:00.160]  next year. And I believe that we, we were corrected and the correction was, we didn't
[35:00.160 --> 35:06.440]  say next year, we said not this year. And, Oh, it's like, you know, so, and there've
[35:06.440 --> 35:10.800]  been people on Twitter accusing me of spinning this whole thing in Apple's favor because
[35:10.800 --> 35:15.400]  I've said this overall, your story on tech crunch about this whole thing is very good
[35:15.400 --> 35:21.480]  news for serious Mac pro users. The part that I'm saying is good news is, is not the part
[35:21.480 --> 35:26.720]  that the Mac pro isn't shipping this year. That's obviously bad news. The part that is
[35:26.720 --> 35:31.260]  good news is all this stuff about the pro workflows group and how they're working hand
[35:31.260 --> 35:38.740]  in hand with actual professional film editors and music producers and musicians in Cupertino
[35:38.740 --> 35:43.520]  in apples, you know, at Apple park, working hand in hand with them as Apple employees
[35:43.520 --> 35:47.800]  or as, as full-time contractors, if it's a shorter term thing so that they can learn
[35:47.800 --> 35:52.120]  and study what these people need, not just from the apps that they're using, but that
[35:52.120 --> 36:00.160]  they're actually, these people are these true pros are informing the design of the new Mac
[36:00.160 --> 36:05.560]  pro itself. And I think that is undeniably very good news, but this aspect about it not
[36:05.560 --> 36:10.760]  coming until next year, it it's clear in hindsight that they were kind of setting this up for
[36:10.760 --> 36:16.680]  that. My, my bottom line is that I think what they were trying to say is that we're shooting
[36:16.680 --> 36:21.980]  for late 2018, but you know, it could be 2019. So we're not going to say anything other than
[36:21.980 --> 36:23.280]  not this year.
[36:23.280 --> 36:29.800]  Right. And, you know, my, and, uh, I did go back and look and the, the phrasing was definitely
[36:29.800 --> 36:35.160]  clear or not. I shouldn't say clear, but it was definitely not clear that it was 2018.
[36:35.160 --> 36:39.680]  Right. Right. If that makes sense. And then I, I, I believe I asked for confirmation,
[36:39.680 --> 36:45.320]  um, and it basically, it was like, you know, Hey, exactly what was said. And when you read
[36:45.320 --> 36:50.680]  what was said, it said, it's not a product for this year. Right. That's basically what
[36:50.680 --> 36:57.440]  they said. And that was in 2017. Right. Yeah. And that, that either basically is a means
[36:57.440 --> 37:02.960]  that it may not have been, it may have been a 2018 product, but it also, they weren't
[37:02.960 --> 37:09.040]  promising that. And clearly, obviously it's not, they said 2019 now that the trashcan
[37:09.040 --> 37:15.400]  Mac pro is obviously, um, you know, it's, how much do you think that they, that the,
[37:15.400 --> 37:20.080]  they hate that in the product design group, they must love that it's called the trashcan
[37:20.080 --> 37:24.520]  macro. I mean, it must be extended. I'm sorry. Go ahead. It's yes, the trash came back. It's
[37:24.520 --> 37:29.960]  clearly heading towards the trashcan of history, the jet turbine, a super polished, awesome
[37:29.960 --> 37:41.480]  Mac pro in addition to its striking looks, it was in architecture, it was a very unusual
[37:41.480 --> 37:49.080]  computer. It was not like the PC workstations from, you know, companies like Dell or whoever
[37:49.080 --> 37:55.640]  else makes them. And it wasn't like any Mac previously made, uh, you know, maybe in spirit
[37:55.640 --> 38:00.920]  closest to the cube, uh, you know, just in terms of density and, and being like an artifact
[38:00.920 --> 38:05.340]  that you would really, that you want on your desk. I mean, I even said this at the introduction
[38:05.340 --> 38:08.440]  at the introduction of it, that it's, this is something you're going to want on your
[38:08.440 --> 38:12.480]  desk. Not, you're not going to want to put it on the floor. Um, yeah, it turns out I
[38:12.480 --> 38:16.800]  want it on my desk. It's just, right. But it turns out I can do anything with it. You
[38:16.800 --> 38:24.360]  know, the, the, you know, I, I, it's, it's simplistic to reduce it to just one thing,
[38:24.360 --> 38:28.720]  but basically they overlooked the, at the time they designed it, they overlooked the
[38:28.720 --> 38:35.680]  growing importance of GPU's to pro computing. And that just was a Mac, you know, there were
[38:35.680 --> 38:39.360]  just so many GPU problems with people who have these Mac pros and they couldn't keep
[38:39.360 --> 38:45.900]  up with the state of the art and they couldn't massively parallelize by adding more because
[38:45.900 --> 38:51.800]  it was designed for this very specific amount of GPU heat output. And that's, that's it.
[38:51.800 --> 38:57.600]  Um, right. And so they more or less told us this last year, really. I mean, no, actually
[38:57.600 --> 38:58.600]  no more or less.
[38:58.600 --> 39:03.440]  You use the phrase thermal corner specifically. That was in relation to the GP. We painted
[39:03.440 --> 39:09.120]  ourselves into a thermal corner. Um, and so it was very, you know, and they didn't have
[39:09.120 --> 39:14.880]  anything to say about what, what will the new Mac pro look like other than they did
[39:14.880 --> 39:20.620]  use the word modular as an adjective, you know, that it would be a modular design. Uh,
[39:20.620 --> 39:24.900]  and unsurprising, you know, it's given as it was, uh, you know, extraordinary how much
[39:24.900 --> 39:28.640]  information they gave us. It was extraordinary that they, you know, more or less admitted
[39:28.640 --> 39:34.400]  to a major mistake on a very, uh, on a product that's sells to very few people, but it is
[39:34.400 --> 39:39.480]  extraordinarily important to them because it's, you know, their livelihood is done on
[39:39.480 --> 39:45.320]  these machines. Um, I think there was an assumption on an awful lot of people's parts that they
[39:45.320 --> 39:50.600]  were just going to, uh, you know, more or less go back to the philosophy of the cheese
[39:50.600 --> 39:59.200]  grater Mac pros and we'll just make a big aluminum box and we'll just put the most powerful
[39:59.200 --> 40:05.060]  Intel Xeons that we can buy from Intel in there and have a bunch of slots for other
[40:05.060 --> 40:12.160]  stuff and, um, call it a day. You know, I don't think people are expecting it to literally
[40:12.160 --> 40:18.200]  look like the, the cheese grater that, uh, preceded the trashcan. I'm sure they love
[40:18.200 --> 40:23.600]  all these terms, cheese graters, trash cans. But if I use these terms, you'll know what
[40:23.600 --> 40:29.200]  I mean. Um, like somebody on Twitter who was clearly frustrated and I see it as they, somebody
[40:29.200 --> 40:33.100]  had tweeted at me and I did laugh. Like they're obviously angry, but I appreciated the joke
[40:33.100 --> 40:40.040]  is that they said that they could literally just put it into, into old power Mac G three
[40:40.040 --> 40:44.920]  boxes that they still have lying around. And I would be perfectly happy, you know, go back
[40:44.920 --> 40:50.800]  to the old Bondi blue, uh, power Mac G three boxes and just as long as you stuff it to
[40:50.800 --> 40:56.480]  the gills with, you know, powerful workstation stuff, you know, I lost count of the number
[40:56.480 --> 41:01.980]  of people saying how hard can it be? Uh, you know, and I think if what they announced next
[41:01.980 --> 41:09.880]  year is just a big, big PC workstation box, uh, you know, that's more, let's just put
[41:09.880 --> 41:15.960]  a big, put everything in a big box and cool it. I guess we will have to ask, Hmm, why
[41:15.960 --> 41:21.320]  did that take two years? I just get the feeling that they've got something else in mind that,
[41:21.320 --> 41:25.160]  no, they are not, you know, they are definitely going in a very different direction from the
[41:25.160 --> 41:35.080]  trashcan, but that they still have very ambitious, um, plans for something that is not, not just
[41:35.080 --> 41:39.640]  the Mac OS running on a workstation you could buy from Dell.
[41:39.640 --> 41:47.340]  Yeah. Like not, not an officially licensed tack and Taj speak, uh, of just a kind of
[41:47.340 --> 41:52.820]  generic parts. I mean, I know everybody wants like Nvidia GPUs and they want them, you know,
[41:52.820 --> 41:56.480]  in a box and they want to maybe be able to add one more and then replace it when a new
[41:56.480 --> 42:01.640]  one comes out. And I appreciate that. And I don't disagree necessarily. Um, I mean,
[42:01.640 --> 42:07.800]  I certainly, I have a PC and I use it for gaming. Um, I don't use it for a much else,
[42:07.800 --> 42:13.080]  to be honest, because I can't stay in windows, but I, as modern windows, especially like
[42:13.080 --> 42:19.120]  last version of windows, I like was like 95. It was, I use like, like it was okay. Um,
[42:19.120 --> 42:26.040]  but the, the feature of being essentially feature of being able to replace that GPU
[42:26.040 --> 42:30.040]  and get an upgraded gaming experience for me has always led me to, you know, keep a
[42:30.040 --> 42:35.840]  PC around and say, Hey, if I want to play destiny at 60 frames per second, you know,
[42:35.840 --> 42:40.800]  with all of the water droplets and all of the cool stuff turned on, I can do that. And
[42:40.800 --> 42:49.880]  the, the fact is that I don't, I don't see that as the way that Apple is thinking about
[42:49.880 --> 42:55.240]  their machines at all. Um, and I know, obviously I'm talking about consuming games, not making
[42:55.240 --> 43:00.560]  games, but people that build games use roughly this, you know, similar hardware. Um, I think
[43:00.560 --> 43:06.760]  that it is the, the term modular keeps sticking in my mind because they did emphasize again
[43:06.760 --> 43:13.680]  in this chat, I asked, I said, you know, Hey, you know, obviously, you know, whatever you
[43:13.680 --> 43:19.040]  want to say about it or not say about it is up to you, but can you characterize this modular
[43:19.040 --> 43:23.020]  thing? How important is this? Is this still stand? In other words, have you, have you
[43:23.020 --> 43:28.580]  changed fundamentally your thought process on the Mac pro since we last talked and the
[43:28.580 --> 43:33.000]  basic gist is the, no, we haven't changed the fundamental architecture of what we wanted
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.260]  to build since we last talked. Now, of course, I don't know how much of it they had done
[43:37.260 --> 43:43.160]  then, but you know, the, the arc of it seems to be continuing on whatever trajectory they
[43:43.160 --> 43:50.480]  had set, um, a year ago. Um, but they said that modularity was absolutely a core part
[43:50.480 --> 43:57.380]  of it, whatever it is. Um, I just don't know if the idea of modular that Apple has in mind
[43:57.380 --> 44:03.000]  is going to be the same modular that, uh, you know, uh, your average pro who wants a
[44:03.000 --> 44:10.620]  cheese grater with multiple slots has in mind. Um, I don't want to put you on the spot, but
[44:10.620 --> 44:15.440]  so I'll just speak for myself and I will say that this, there are times when people at
[44:15.440 --> 44:21.740]  Apple, uh, will answer my questions, but answer them off the record or on background or something
[44:21.740 --> 44:30.260]  like that. I will say on this, on the whole iMac pro and Mac pro front, um, everything
[44:30.260 --> 44:33.260]  and it's, it's extraordinary how much they told us, but everything that they told me
[44:33.260 --> 44:39.280]  about it was on the record there. I didn't know anything about the iMac pro before it
[44:39.280 --> 44:44.680]  was unveiled at WWDC other than what we wrote about from the round table, you know, last
[44:44.680 --> 44:50.740]  year that they have a just to just had a pro minded config of the iMac 27 inch iMac in
[44:50.740 --> 44:56.520]  the works. And they did say last year it would be later this year. Um, and that they think
[44:56.520 --> 45:03.740]  it's going to be the most commonly bought desktop for professional Mac use for the most
[45:03.740 --> 45:08.940]  number of Mac users. Um, I don't know, I didn't know anything else about it. I don't know
[45:08.940 --> 45:13.740]  anything else about the upcoming Mac pro other than what is on the record. Uh, so I have
[45:13.740 --> 45:19.940]  no insight information. I don't have any little birdies who work on this, on that team. Um,
[45:19.940 --> 45:24.940]  so what I'm speculating here is entirely my speculation. This is not really, this is,
[45:24.940 --> 45:34.220]  there's no background information. My guess is that they decided that the trashcan was
[45:34.220 --> 45:40.700]  a mistake a while before the round table, maybe even a year. I mean, cause they knew,
[45:40.700 --> 45:46.940]  they knew how many hundreds of years that they'd gone without even like a speed bump.
[45:46.940 --> 45:50.660]  Um, I mean it, you know, I'm sure that they were embarrassed by that. They certainly didn't
[45:50.660 --> 45:56.060]  let on that they were embarrassed last year. I mean, they're Apple, they're pros. Um, but
[45:56.060 --> 46:01.540]  they knew, I mean, and so they must've thought, here's what I think happened is that, you
[46:01.540 --> 46:05.420]  know, obviously when they launched the trashcan, they certainly didn't anticipate that they
[46:05.420 --> 46:10.140]  were never going to do a significant update to it. Um, they, they thought this was the
[46:10.140 --> 46:14.900]  future and we'll update it. And then it turned out that they made a very strong editorial
[46:14.900 --> 46:20.020]  bet on the way compute was going and it just went left instead of right. It went left instead
[46:20.020 --> 46:26.180]  of right. And then at a certain point, I think they started working on this. The, what we
[46:26.180 --> 46:30.460]  now know is the iMac pro. Cause one thing we now know about the iMac pro is the iMac
[46:30.460 --> 46:38.380]  pro is not just a slightly faster regular iMac with black anodized aluminum. It is a
[46:38.380 --> 46:44.580]  completely different architecture, totally different thermal architecture. Um, and it,
[46:44.580 --> 46:52.260]  you know, uses an entirely different class of CPU and GPU. Um, and you know, the totally
[46:52.260 --> 46:56.220]  different thermal system is exactly why that was necessary, right? You'd put, if you put
[46:56.220 --> 47:01.460]  the iMac pros internals into a regular iMac, it would melt, it would, it would, it wouldn't
[47:01.460 --> 47:10.200]  work. Um, I think that at some point internally, they're either their official plan or their,
[47:10.200 --> 47:18.500]  this is probably the plan plan was that the iMac pro would be the pro desktop that will
[47:18.500 --> 47:23.660]  just stretch. We'll, we'll stretch it out with the trashcan until we get this iMac pro
[47:23.660 --> 47:29.260]  out and then that's our new pro desktop. And I think what happened in hindsight, you know,
[47:29.260 --> 47:34.220]  I mean, I think at some point last year or probably around March, I think it was probably
[47:34.220 --> 47:39.460]  right before they called us in for the round table. They had like a come to Jesus moment
[47:39.460 --> 47:43.660]  where they were like, you know what, here's, here's the type of pros who even this, you
[47:43.660 --> 47:47.300]  know, iMac pro, which is shaping up to be a great device. Every, I mean, I haven't seen
[47:47.300 --> 47:51.740]  a bad review of the iMac pro everybody. No, it's very well received, very well received.
[47:51.740 --> 47:56.260]  And I think, you know, by, by early last year, I think they were, must've been far enough
[47:56.260 --> 48:02.300]  along to know exactly how good it was going to be. Um, but I think they had a moment internally
[48:02.300 --> 48:08.060]  where they were like, but wait, here's a use case. Here's a use case. Here's somebody who
[48:08.060 --> 48:13.660]  this isn't enough, you know, and that there, we're going to lose these people to windows
[48:13.660 --> 48:18.960]  or Linux or other platforms because they need, you know, they need things that even the iMac
[48:18.960 --> 48:24.060]  pro can't, can't give them. And those machines are out there on the market. They just don't
[48:24.060 --> 48:30.620]  run Mac OS 10. Um, I think they had that moment and then thought, well shit, what do we do?
[48:30.620 --> 48:34.620]  We're stuck. We cannot have, you know, we can't make that happen in this enclosure.
[48:34.620 --> 48:38.820]  I think they, I think that's when they convened the round table. I think that round table
[48:38.820 --> 48:43.900]  was convened very shortly after they decided to make a new Mac pro and I think that's why
[48:43.900 --> 48:48.840]  they're still not done because I really think that as of like the round table, the entire
[48:48.840 --> 48:58.140]  plan was like the words new Mac pro Matt modular written on a, on a notepad. I don't know.
[48:58.140 --> 49:01.880]  What do you think about that with the timing? I think my time, I'm pretty sure that that's
[49:01.880 --> 49:05.060]  the timing, but nobody, I don't have any confirmation of that.
[49:05.060 --> 49:10.740]  So you're saying like, like give me a Q, a quarter that you think that this basically
[49:10.740 --> 49:17.340]  this project started in earnest. You think it started like a Q, Q two of last year. I
[49:17.340 --> 49:26.060]  do. Cause when was our, when was our round table? March? Uh, or was it? Yeah, I thought
[49:26.060 --> 49:31.660]  April, April. Yeah. Either late March or early April. I think early. I think that they started
[49:31.660 --> 49:35.620]  putting the band together to make it, you know, at like the end of March, you know,
[49:35.620 --> 49:41.020]  they're like, okay. Okay. So I, I agree. Uh, I mean, I, and once again, um, I can't actually
[49:41.020 --> 49:44.500]  tell you in this case, like, you know, it's not like, uh, I couldn't tell you if I, if
[49:44.500 --> 49:48.400]  I knew right back, I don't know, you know, they didn't, they didn't tell me, um, they're
[49:48.400 --> 49:52.740]  not very keen on going, Oh, well we started this project this date and edited on that
[49:52.740 --> 49:59.420]  one. I mean, I, I re one, one person that, um, um, and I can't remember who it is, so
[49:59.420 --> 50:02.540]  I'm not going to say the name. So like, I'm afraid to say the name, but, uh, one, one
[50:02.540 --> 50:08.900]  person, one Apple exec said during the iPhone 10 round table that they had, they didn't
[50:08.900 --> 50:13.100]  on the record one with a bunch of international journalists and a couple from the U S and
[50:13.100 --> 50:17.820]  one of the things that they had said, they explicitly said when they started basically
[50:17.820 --> 50:22.460]  when they locked at one of the PR people there was like, ah, you know, like they don't want
[50:22.460 --> 50:26.980]  to know when designs are locked and when they're shipped. Not honestly because the, that lock
[50:26.980 --> 50:31.260]  date is all that secret or special cause it's really not, it's just like an arbitrary date
[50:31.260 --> 50:35.540]  where they're like, okay, you know, begin the things we can begin now. Um, we think
[50:35.540 --> 50:39.860]  we have this design pretty much set. Um, and it's more about not giving away competitive
[50:39.860 --> 50:44.980]  information like, Hey, if we lock this, Apple was able to lock this in November and ship
[50:44.980 --> 50:51.380]  it in December of the next year or whatever, you know, that, um, that or September the
[50:51.380 --> 50:56.180]  next year, that information is maybe mean nothing to the average person to be honest.
[50:56.180 --> 50:59.740]  Like even if you were a reporter and you found it out and put it in the story, the average
[50:59.740 --> 51:04.220]  person may not know or care, you know, who cares? Right. It's like, okay, great. You
[51:04.220 --> 51:10.460]  know, it took them like nine months to build this thing. All right. But for another manufacturer
[51:10.460 --> 51:14.740]  or for an analyst, this is incredibly valuable information that they can reverse engineer
[51:14.740 --> 51:20.780]  essentially into a lot of additional competitive advantage, you know, competitive information
[51:20.780 --> 51:27.820]  that can give them advantages either in purchasing or manufacturing. So if that, that said, there
[51:27.820 --> 51:31.020]  was none of that slippage here. Like they didn't say, Oh, we started the project at
[51:31.020 --> 51:36.280]  X and you know, we're going to ship in 2019. None of that. So I, my conjecture basically
[51:36.280 --> 51:42.740]  is the same as yours. Also based on just my vibe and not any actual information.
[51:42.740 --> 51:50.980]  Uh, my favorite, uh, story like that was, uh, after the antenna gate press conference,
[51:50.980 --> 52:01.020]  that must've been 2010, right? Uh, cause 2007 was the iPhone, 2008 was the three G, 2009
[52:01.020 --> 52:06.140]  was the three GS. So 2010 would be the iPhone four. So there's the antenna gate press conference.
[52:06.140 --> 52:13.980]  I'm out there, it's in town hall. Um, and I think they took about a dozen of us on a
[52:13.980 --> 52:17.860]  backstage tour, a lot like the audio tour. I told you this before, but we, when, when
[52:17.860 --> 52:24.180]  we took that tour of their audio facilities for the home pod earlier or earlier this year,
[52:24.180 --> 52:29.940]  where's that last year? Well, a couple months ago, um, they took us on a tour of their antenna
[52:29.940 --> 52:36.380]  testing labs, uh, and it was guided by like their head and tenant engineer. A really interesting,
[52:36.380 --> 52:39.420]  really cool stuff, but only about a dozen of us. And then at one point during the tour,
[52:39.420 --> 52:43.980]  somebody asked him and you know, and you could, he did a great job. He was, you know, it's
[52:43.980 --> 52:49.300]  like a typical Apple person is both good at their job and able to explain what they do
[52:49.300 --> 52:55.540]  very well. And it's like, I forget who's adage it is, but um, you know, that if you can't
[52:55.540 --> 52:59.220]  explain it in terms that lay person would understand, then you don't really understand
[52:59.220 --> 53:03.300]  it. I don't know, it might be Einstein or it might be, yeah, if you can't explain, yeah,
[53:03.300 --> 53:06.660]  if you can't explain it to a five year old, you don't understand it or whatever the case.
[53:06.660 --> 53:14.460]  Uh, yeah. Um, you know, it did a great job, but obviously was not used to talking to the
[53:14.460 --> 53:19.380]  press. You know, you could see a sense of certain nervousness, you know, Apple people,
[53:19.380 --> 53:24.100]  you know, you know, they know that it's their instincts, their instincts tell them you don't
[53:24.100 --> 53:27.680]  talk to the press, you don't talk to the press. And then all of a sudden, you know, like Katie
[53:27.680 --> 53:31.860]  cotton is there and, and they're like, Hey, what would you think about leading a tour
[53:31.860 --> 53:37.780]  of the press on the record? You know, uh, but somebody asked him how long they'd been
[53:37.780 --> 53:43.980]  working on the external design of the iPhone four antenna. And he just said, Oh, about
[53:43.980 --> 53:48.100]  three years. And, uh, Schiller was on the tour, not speaking, but just walking around
[53:48.100 --> 53:51.780]  with this and Phil Schiller jumped in and just, he was ready for it. And he just said,
[53:51.780 --> 53:55.380]  we're not here to talk about timelines. You know, he didn't like bark at him or anything,
[53:55.380 --> 53:58.180]  but I noticed that he like immediately jumped in and was like, we're not here to talk about
[53:58.180 --> 54:02.260]  timelines. Cause they just, even when they were like, Oh, let's open the kimono here
[54:02.260 --> 54:06.140]  and let you see how we test these antennas and revealing all sorts of things we'd never
[54:06.140 --> 54:10.380]  revealed before. They don't want to talk about how long they were working on something.
[54:10.380 --> 54:16.820]  Mm hmm. Yeah. And I think that is an expectation thing. Like you don't want somebody to go,
[54:16.820 --> 54:21.460]  Oh, well let me count backwards from next September. I think it's competitive. I think
[54:21.460 --> 54:25.580]  it's competitive. It's all competitive. It's both competitive in terms of letting it competitors
[54:25.580 --> 54:30.600]  know how long they work on something. And for anybody trying to look at their strategy,
[54:30.600 --> 54:34.460]  like you just said, like look at the calendar, go back three years. What did it look like
[54:34.460 --> 54:39.660]  then? Hmm. What would have happened then that would make them decide to do this? Hmm. Yeah.
[54:39.660 --> 54:45.380]  And even, I mean, even the layman now, I mean, for instance, the iPhone 10 thing, you know,
[54:45.380 --> 54:48.660]  there was some stuff around that set on the record that basically told you like, we've
[54:48.660 --> 54:53.300]  been working on this for three years. You know, they very explicitly said things like,
[54:53.300 --> 54:59.100]  you know, this year. So that whole context, the context for that conversation was around
[54:59.100 --> 55:04.260]  the FaceTime or not FaceTime, the Face ID thing, you know, and everybody was like, Oh,
[55:04.260 --> 55:07.580]  you just threw face idea. And then at the last minute, like these reports came out and
[55:07.580 --> 55:12.860]  they're like, uh, no, first of all, you can't, it's impossible. And second of all, like we
[55:12.860 --> 55:18.740]  locked this thing way before like you, you even published your piece. So, you know, you
[55:18.740 --> 55:24.260]  know, and like that, that situation I think is, it allowed us to see a little bit more
[55:24.260 --> 55:30.540]  of, Hey, this really is like, they're deciding these things three years ahead. And yes, they
[55:30.540 --> 55:36.140]  can, because they're nimble, they can make final decisions on things as late as lock
[55:36.140 --> 55:41.420]  date, right? They could say, Hey, this thing. And, and what I heard basically, and this
[55:41.420 --> 55:45.020]  is, this is not on the record is not an official and it's not even off the record. It's just
[55:45.020 --> 55:50.340]  what I heard through people, right? Is that they, they had very, they had a phone without
[55:50.340 --> 55:56.220]  the, the, um, the second camera in it when they launched this, the two camera. Yeah.
[55:56.220 --> 56:01.780]  What was that? Six or seven or whatever they all blur together. Yeah. Might've been this,
[56:01.780 --> 56:06.400]  whatever the plus was with the two cameras. They had one without, right? Because you know,
[56:06.400 --> 56:10.100]  what if it doesn't work right? They had like a design ready to go. And then at the last
[56:10.100 --> 56:14.520]  minute they're like, ah, let's just do it. Right. Like they felt they could do it and
[56:14.520 --> 56:18.180]  they felt they could get it done. And so they locked that design and essentially stepped
[56:18.180 --> 56:23.260]  off a ledge, you know, and eventually of course shipped the twin lens. But you know, that,
[56:23.260 --> 56:28.220]  that kind of, you know, it takes, it takes guts. It takes like a Supreme handle on your
[56:28.220 --> 56:33.140]  supply chain. It takes the ability to like inch that thing, that kind of major decision
[56:33.140 --> 56:37.220]  later and later and later. And I think people that treat that as like, Oh, they don't know
[56:37.220 --> 56:42.460]  what they're doing. It really is. It does a disservice to like the engineers actually
[56:42.460 --> 56:46.860]  trying to push the envelope as far as they can, you know, to the bleeding edge of what's
[56:46.860 --> 56:51.780]  possible. And then they ship that thing that's barely possible. And then people are like,
[56:51.780 --> 56:55.740]  Oh, well, you just did this at the last minute just for giggles. And it's like, no, man,
[56:55.740 --> 57:02.420]  you know, no, we had to try really, really hard to do this. And then we did it. And sure,
[57:02.420 --> 57:07.060]  like it works like 80% as well as we say it does on stage. Right. But then we get it there
[57:07.060 --> 57:11.100]  the next iteration and yada yada. But yeah, I think that's the same kind of thing they're
[57:11.100 --> 57:15.580]  working on with this that if they're making decisions on the Mac Pro, I think that they,
[57:15.580 --> 57:19.780]  you know, they would have had to made major architectural decisions a while ago now. But
[57:19.780 --> 57:24.180]  I think they could definitely make some real gutsy calls still late in the game, you know,
[57:24.180 --> 57:27.420]  I think at this point, those are done, maybe, maybe you got a couple more months to figure
[57:27.420 --> 57:33.980]  that out. If you're shipping 2019. And let's say you assume maximum potential, like, in
[57:33.980 --> 57:37.380]  other words, they're going to ship it late 2019. I'm not saying they are, they did not
[57:37.380 --> 57:41.300]  give any indication. But if they're going to announce it, like it, say a dub dub, and
[57:41.300 --> 57:46.540]  then ship it later in the year, you know, you figure right now, it's not as I mean,
[57:46.540 --> 57:50.740]  I don't know what the design is, maybe it is, but I would imagine it's not as mission
[57:50.740 --> 57:55.420]  critical as like a smartphone to get right, you know, that that kind of lineup done where
[57:55.420 --> 58:01.720]  you're doing that really fine to like, you know, 16 different components coming together
[58:01.720 --> 58:06.820]  all into one component, which goes into another 250 components. I don't probably not at that
[58:06.820 --> 58:12.420]  level, but it's still got to be pretty soon that they're locking that down. And if so,
[58:12.420 --> 58:15.300]  if they're locking it down in another four or five months, let's say, or a little bit
[58:15.300 --> 58:19.540]  more than that, they have a few months left to actually make major decisions about what
[58:19.540 --> 58:23.700]  they're going to do. And, you know, if that's not the case, then they figured it out. And
[58:23.700 --> 58:26.820]  they're they're plowing ahead and whatever, they're just doing manufacturing, testing
[58:26.820 --> 58:29.820]  and whatnot. But I don't think so. Yeah, I think they're not done yet. In other words,
[58:29.820 --> 58:36.500]  Yeah, and I don't think I don't think we're going to see a preview of it at WWDC. I could
[58:36.500 --> 58:40.780]  be wrong. I mean, they obviously did it last year with the iMac Pro and shipped later that
[58:40.780 --> 58:47.540]  year. And if they if I guess if they think they're shipping early 2019, they could. But
[58:47.540 --> 58:52.900]  I don't think so. I think there's it's a different situation this year, you know, and I feel
[58:52.900 --> 58:59.260]  like with the iMac Pro, they could show it. And everybody knows what an iMac looks like
[58:59.260 --> 59:05.580]  it, you know, the iMac Pro looks like an iMac, it's just black and therefore cooler. Whereas
[59:05.580 --> 59:11.300]  I feel like they're doing something with this that they don't want to spoil too far in advance.
[59:11.300 --> 59:16.140]  You know, and one thing you have to recognize is when Apple makes a successful hardware
[59:16.140 --> 59:23.020]  product, all of a sudden, a lot of other competing products start looking very similar.
[59:23.020 --> 59:26.220]  Even if they have absolutely no reason to do so. Like, have you seen all of these Android
[59:26.220 --> 59:31.840]  phones coming out with a notch? Yeah, it's it's really like, it's like it's amazing.
[59:31.840 --> 59:35.660]  It's like a tag. Like I have like a tag in my a lot of a lot of them don't even have
[59:35.660 --> 59:40.460]  anything special. It's just like regular cameras. Like you can just put a regular camera in
[59:40.460 --> 59:48.180]  the frame. Nobody's gonna kill you. It's copying the worst aspect of the iPhone 10. Like in
[59:48.180 --> 59:53.580]  hindsight, now months into it, I'm fine with the notch. I get it. You know, I still think
[59:53.580 --> 59:57.580]  though it's the worst part of the phone. I can't wait for them to figure out a way to
[59:57.580 --> 01:00:04.140]  do all this without a notch and just have the screen go edge to edge, corner to corner.
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:09.180]  They're copying the one part of the phone that everybody agrees is actually I don't
[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:13.220]  think anyone Apple likes it either. I never had a single person tell me, Oh, the notch
[01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:17.300]  is great and lovely. And we love it. Right. It was we the notch needs to be there. We
[01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:21.180]  think the the cost of the notch or whatever you want to call it, they don't even call
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:27.900]  it a notch. They hate another word. They call it the same. They call it the sensor. Yeah,
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:36.740]  whatever it is. Yeah. But that area. That area on the phone is there. Nobody loves that
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:41.640]  it's there, including the people that had to put it there. They were like, Hey, we could
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:46.420]  do this, what we think is a really awesome forward looking thing. And we could, you know,
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:50.180]  all of this kind of works like the corners could be used for things and we could push
[01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:55.380]  the rest of it edge to edge. And this is the way we chose to do it. And, and it makes sense
[01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:59.860]  completely with Apple's design language that they're going to utilize those little corners
[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:03.460]  instead of putting black all the way across. Because they're like, we don't need black
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:08.500]  here. So why put it there? Right. That's their, you know, that's the gets to the core of what
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:14.340]  how they're they design products. And like that, that whole thing is literally just in
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:20.040]  service of those cameras. It was not by any means because they thought it looked great.
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:25.660]  And looked awesome. And so for somebody who has no need of it to put it there, it's like,
[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:29.420]  you know, really, I don't know. It's like putting a spoiler on a minivan. The Android
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:35.660]  phones that are coming out with notches are both the most like, I slapped my head on the
[01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:40.500]  forehead. I slapped my forehead on the table. Like I cannot believe they did this and simultaneously
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:46.020]  the least surprising thing of the year. I love the stories. They had stories. The verge
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:53.500]  had stories I think from was it Mobile World Congress, whatever the big cell phone conference
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:57.660]  was that was a couple weeks ago where where these handset makers show off upcoming phones
[01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:01.740]  that haven't been seen before. And there were several of them. Yeah, MWC. There were several
[01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:07.040]  of them that had fake iPhone 10 style notches that didn't even have a version of Android
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:11.300]  installed that was aware there was a notch there. So they were it was like drawing underneath
[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:18.100]  the notch, like all those notifications that line up on the Android. Right. And one where
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:25.300]  like the date or time was clipped. It's just like, what are you doing? I can't believe
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:28.940]  it. All right. Hold on a second. I'm going to take a break here. Fast follow. I got to
[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:34.100]  take a break here and thank our next sponsor. Longtime sponsor and fan, you know, supporter
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:41.660]  of the show, Casper. Any guys know Casper? Casper makes innovative, award winning sleep
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:45.860]  products. Well, here's the deal. They've got a new mattress that they called the Wave,
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:50.340]  and it's their most innovative, innovative mattress from the sleep experts at Casper.
[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:55.240]  It's the first mattress of its kind to relieve pressure at 36 different points so you can
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:59.940]  feel relaxed in ways you never thought possible. It features advanced temperature regulating
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:05.380]  technology to help you sleep cool and comfortable without overeating during the night as five
[01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:11.600]  layers of superior foam, including a cushioning top layer for maximum comfort. It's their
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:17.040]  biggest breakthrough in sleep technology. And one of the things that they studied and
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:22.080]  I mean this, they really do have mattress engineers. This is, you know, they did. Casper
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:27.740]  doesn't buy mattresses from some, you know, Chinese factory and just slap a Casper sticker
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:30.820]  on them. They really engineer these things. And one of the things they looked at with
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:36.020]  the Wave is trying to create a mattress that works as well as possible, whether you're
[01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:41.820]  a back sleeper, stomach sleeper or a side sleeper. It works great for all three types
[01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:47.440]  of sleepers. Me personally, I got to tell you, I do all three. I'm a sort of a every
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:52.620]  two hours if I wake up, the only way I get back to sleep is to like change. So, you know,
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:56.100]  flip around or turn on my side or whatever. So that sounds good to me because I'm all
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:04:02.380]  three. Now the Wave is also designed to keep its original form so you'll be supported
[01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:08.740]  for years to come. This is supposed to be a very, very durable mattress. It's just
[01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:15.100]  a great product. I love these guys. Now when you buy the Wave, your Wave purchase comes
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:21.740]  with in-home white glove delivery and set up for free. That's just part of the cost
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:25.780]  of the mattress is they will just show up with a white glove team and set it up in your
[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:32.020]  bedroom just where you want it just so. And here's the best deal. If you're a listener
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:37.980]  of the show, you can save a hundred bucks off a Wave mattress by going to casper.com.
[01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:45.820]  C-A-S-P-E-R casper.com slash talk show 100. That's talk show because you're listening
[01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:50.080]  to the talk show and a hundred because you're going to save a hundred bucks and then just
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:58.500]  use that promo code, talk show 100. So casper.com slash talk show 100 with promo code 100.
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:02.980]  Terms and conditions do apply but you'll save a hundred bucks with that code. My thanks
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:10.560]  to Casper and her Wave mattress. What is your take? What is your take on this angle before
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:17.080]  we drop it of why are they bothering to overengineer? Are they going to just make a different type
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:22.940]  of mistake like the trash can Mac Pro by over-engineering this and not doing, you know, they have the
[01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:26.780]  humility to admit they made a mistake and they're starting over but is it a problem
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:32.660]  perhaps that maybe they lack the humility to just do the obvious thing? I guarantee
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:38.540]  you there are thousands of people listening to the show right now who are saying yes that.
[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:43.980]  Just do that thing, please. And second, I get it. Second part of the question is okay
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:49.780]  if you want to go and have John Ternus and his team go off and build the supercomputer
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:57.020]  of Apple's ambitious dreams. Okay, but in the meantime, how about you just stick a big
[01:05:57.020 --> 01:06:04.280]  Z on in a box call it the Mac Pro and sell it to me. Right, right. Yeah, put like put
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:11.220]  your B team on just popping this thing out while your A team goes off and you know, applies
[01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:18.060]  quantum mechanics to aluminum and comes up with something new. I mean, I think there's
[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:23.300]  two major possibilities. One is that they are in fact figuring out the best possible
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:31.980]  way to build what we have considered to be PC, you know, box like a tower computer, right?
[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:36.660]  That's one possibility. They're just taking every angle of that thing and examining how
[01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:41.980]  could this be better? What are the problems? It's like when case manufacturers went from
[01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:46.500]  making you screw everything in to like, to those member they moved to those big, I don't
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:50.500]  know how many PCs you built over the years, but they moved to those big thumbscrews. Yeah,
[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:55.420]  I know. And then I know. And then and then they moved from thumbscrews to clip in. So
[01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:59.540]  like almost all modern PC cases. Now you don't they're called tool this cases, right? You
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:03.740]  just you get them pull them out of the box. You can unclip all of the stuff that you need.
[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:07.360]  You can pull out the motherboard tray. I think some of the mostly the motherboards still
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:14.300]  need to be like punched in or screwed in because they've got the posts for for, you know, electric
[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:18.700]  insulation and whatnot. But and standoffs from the metal cases and stuff. But I think
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:22.820]  even some of those are clipping now. And as you can clip in pretty much every major component,
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:27.020]  like a hard drive and, and your, you know, all of this stuff. But there are a lot of
[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:33.300]  there's a lot about PCs that are still complete BS. Like cable routing is dumb. It's so
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:38.420]  stupid, right? Like that you have to figure out how to route cables inside this case for
[01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:44.220]  work for airflow. And I know some people like that's their that's catnip. Right? Like, I
[01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:48.660]  had a buddy who would route his cables for weeks before he actually finished his piece.
[01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:52.300]  But he's like, he would route it and then like, put it aside to come back to the next
[01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:56.400]  day. Like, hmm, yeah, they do a good job. You know, I get it. I get all that. It's like
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:02.540]  people who have a hobby, like painting miniature figurines. Yes, I get it. I don't I don't
[01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:07.300]  I don't have that hobby. But I don't I don't mock it. I totally get how it might be extremely
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:13.020]  satisfying to spend days at a time on a single tiny little figurine. And that you've got
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:17.500]  this entire army of them ahead of you. And I think that for like, the people who like
[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:22.300]  building their own PCs, like you're saying the cable management is, you know, routing
[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:27.740]  is is sort of like that hobby, you know? Yeah, yeah, the airflow, the cable management, I
[01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:30.820]  mean, you know, testing airflow and all that's figuring all that stuff out. Like, and those
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:34.420]  are that's like self built PCs, PCs, but I think a lot of the same principles apply to
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:39.380]  when you buy one. So if you buy one, and you say want to upgrade it, it still requires
[01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:44.700]  that you open it up that you have to look at a PC slot that you have to look at a motherboard,
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:48.060]  you know that you have to like figure out these the guts of this thing and say, Okay,
[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:52.140]  well, what do I want to change here. And I know there are some pros that build their
[01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:57.380]  own PCs that are very vocal, you know, or have built their own machines over the years
[01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:02.820]  that are very vocal on the web, about how, you know, they just want this thing, this,
[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:07.020]  you know, let me figure it out. So me, I can go buy an Nvidia card and throw it in if I
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:12.780]  want to upgrade all this. That's great. But they they are also being myopic. And they
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:17.740]  don't want to hear this. And I'm sure I'll get email. But I firmly believe that pros
[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:23.980]  are some of the most myopic consumers out there on an individual level, because each
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:31.660]  one of them is so immersed in their skill, they're incredibly skilled, incredibly good
[01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:35.300]  at the thing that they're doing, they've steeped themselves in it, they've made their lives
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:40.980]  work to figure this thing out. And frankly, usually they're intelligent, they're driven,
[01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:45.980]  you know, they have a lot of things that kind of make them that kind of person. But that
[01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:52.340]  doesn't necessarily come part and parcel with, you know, any number of other professional
[01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:58.360]  pursuits outside of say, software engineering, or even hardware engineering or engineering
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:03.740]  at large, right? Like, they're definitely pro pursuits that lend themselves to being
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:10.300]  willing or able or desirous of sort of being able to manipulate the innards of a machine,
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:14.740]  you know, in that way. And then there are a bunch of pros in other fields who are just
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:20.380]  as driven and intelligent and capable and, and, you know, just masters of their craft,
[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:26.540]  who couldn't give a flying F about what what's inside the machine or how it looks, or how
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:31.740]  to, you know, install a graphics card or want to do any of that, right. And so you I think
[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:36.180]  you have to like one thing that I was told, you know, that they mentioned several times
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:44.380]  was that pros are an incredibly diverse bunch, you know, that the pros as a group are not
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:49.780]  a monolith at all, and that some pros may love the iMac Pro, and that'll service them.
[01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:53.900]  Other pros do not want that at all. And they want this more modular design. And that's
[01:10:53.900 --> 01:11:00.820]  understood. But the fact that Apple sees the breadth of that, and I know that people think,
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:04.740]  Oh, yeah, just give me this thing that I could throw a card in. And it's good. And it's all
[01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:10.900]  I want is power and all of that. But I believe that it is biopic to think that that is all
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:17.620]  all pros want. And pros are a very diverse group that utilize computers to create art
[01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:23.140]  and to do finance and to do all kinds of things that could benefit from from more power and
[01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:28.460]  more capability. And yes, more expansion and modularity. I just think that there's a discussion
[01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:33.780]  to be had about what form that takes. And that may be, you know, making somebody stick
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:39.820]  a new PCI card in a PCI slot is not the way to go about it. And I think that's basically
[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:43.580]  the discussion that happened inside Apple, which is why we didn't end up with that or
[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:52.940]  haven't ended up with that yet. Yeah. I guess, you know, I feel like it goes hand in hand
[01:11:52.940 --> 01:12:02.780]  with the eGPU revolution. Right? Like, I don't know, at some point, not too long ago, the
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:07.420]  idea of an external GPU wouldn't even make any sense. It would be like, it would be like
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:11.580]  a line of dialogue on it on like, CIS. And you'd be like, Oh, my God, who wrote that
[01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:16.100]  external GPU? What the hell? That wouldn't work. You know, it's not that long ago that
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:19.180]  it would have just sounded like they threw together, you know, some screenwriter threw
[01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:28.060]  together some words and thought it made sense, you know. But that was a that was a big part
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:31.180]  of what they were talking about last week with you. Right?
[01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:35.060]  Jay Haynes Yeah, so that Okay, so the shape of the discussion
[01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:38.860]  went from Okay, you know, we want to get this out of the way at the top or, you know, recap,
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:44.380]  we want to get this out of the way at the top. Mac Pro 2019, you know, still modular
[01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:49.140]  design, don't have much more to say about it now. You know, that's what we have to say.
[01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:52.940]  The second part of the discussion was really about the pro workflows group. And the group
[01:12:52.940 --> 01:13:00.700]  is designed to literally hire professionals, we're talking award winning video editors,
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:08.700]  award winning musicians, slash, you know, mixers, basically, producers, audio producers,
[01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:14.660]  people that that handle and manipulate and use Apple's products in their workflow. They
[01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:18.860]  give examples, of course, of people outside in the professional world that are still using
[01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:26.140]  them. You know, people that are making music for Star Wars movies and cutting commercials
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:32.860]  and Golden Globe award winning TV shows on Final Cut Pro, you know, etc. Right? Like
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:37.220]  this, this is their ecosystem that they're thinking about in some ways, because it is
[01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:42.100]  in their universe, right? They make software that that these pros these types of pros use
[01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:48.860]  logic, of course, Final Cut Pro, etc. But they don't they know that's not the complete
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:53.100]  universe of pros. That's sort of just where they've begun. And they've also begun a bit
[01:13:53.100 --> 01:14:01.300]  with 3d design as well, and 3d work, like, you know, AR VR, 3d gaming, you know, three
[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:06.820]  work in 3d spaces, let's call it right. And so that is kind of where they've begun their
[01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:13.940]  work to create this group, and to have this group, create feedback and create, you know,
[01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:21.140]  sort of theses that are then incorporated into Mac hardware. And the Mac Pro is absolutely
[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:25.980]  being informed by this group, the iMac Pro was informed by some of the work that this
[01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:30.940]  group did early on. And so like the this is it's existed for a while, it's not completely
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:38.020]  brand new, but they are planning on expanding it to encompass more arenas of professional
[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:44.420]  use down the road. And that as a part of that, I got like, basically kind of a tour, just
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:49.820]  a very small tour of a couple of, of components of how they use that. And each of us were
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:55.180]  everywhere. In that. Yeah. I think it goes without saying, although, but I guess it doesn't
[01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:58.900]  go without saying because I got asked by a couple of people after they read your story
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:05.980]  of, well, that's great. I'm sure that, you know, that's great for movie editors and music
[01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:10.420]  producers. But what about developers? You know, why don't you know, and I think what
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:15.340]  I think goes without saying is Apple is full of developers, you know, they say, like, they're
[01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:20.420]  probably one of the foremost customers of Apple products, right? They, you know, they
[01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:23.580]  don't need to do that. If there's one group of pro users, they don't have to set up a
[01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:28.560]  special team of people to study and work hand in hand with software developers, like they've
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:33.820]  already got that, like, they're going to build something that is a great system for developers.
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:39.420]  And I will reiterate when we had our when the iMac Pro came out in December, and they
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:44.780]  were giving us you know, had like a some press in New York, and we got to meet a, you know,
[01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:51.940]  see a whole bunch of use cases for the iMac Pro software development was a huge, a huge
[01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:59.620]  aspect of that it was a big, you know, it was a big part of the the the tour. And it
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:05.640]  was in fact, presented by an Apple engineer, somebody who works at Apple and software engineering,
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:10.460]  but they even did. They even showed us things on the iMac Pro, and presumably the Mac Pro
[01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:15.540]  is going to even be better at this. But even things that weren't just like, well, everybody
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:20.060]  at Apple is using Xcode and building iOS apps and rack apps, but they were showing us, you
[01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:27.840]  know, like the workflow for like a web developer, who's running virtualized, here's three VMs,
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:32.660]  there's a bunch of running copies of Chrome running, there's like three VMs running Windows
[01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:38.300]  and running Linux and running another version of Windows and running, you know, different,
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:42.140]  you know, different browsers and different things and doing all these automated tests.
[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:47.580]  And, you know, here's, here's the whisper quiet, not hot iMac, handling it with a plum.
[01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:51.540]  So they've got developers backs. Any hint?
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:54.420]  Jay Haynes Yeah, and then other areas, you know, those
[01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:58.100]  will come. And so if you're a game developer, and you're like, Oh, you know, they don't
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:03.880]  understand my 3d needs. Well, that's what this is about. They hired literal game developers,
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:10.740]  they hired literal, literal, you know, technicians that use this stuff to their maximum potential,
[01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:17.000]  to have them create real projects, to, you know, utilize them in a way that they would
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.900]  in their real life in their real workflows, because engineering test cases often do not
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:29.780]  catch or do not highlight the problems that come with an organic workflow. And that is
[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:31.660]  the core tenant. I think of this.
[01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:34.460]  Trenton Larkin Yeah, I one of my favorite anecdotes in your
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:40.380]  story. I think it was john tournes telling you but that they realized after they brought
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:45.420]  this this, these people in and they had one of the groups is a bunch of 3d artists, people,
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:50.300]  you know, I guess making stuff for games or maybe visual effects, people probably similar
[01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:56.900]  workflows, but 3d artists, they're doing real work there at Apple. And they observed that
[01:17:56.900 --> 01:18:00.880]  one of the I don't know what he wasn't gonna throw the whatever the software packages under
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:05.300]  the bus, but whatever software package they're using, there's a palette that they open. And
[01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:10.380]  it turns out professional 3d artists open this palette like 100 times a day. And it
[01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:13.380]  took like, what do you say like five seconds every time,
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:16.620]  Jay Haynes Like six, six seconds to six to 10 seconds or something to open
[01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:19.380]  Trenton Larkin Right. So that's a six second delay to do
[01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:23.700]  what you want to do 100 times a day. And even if he's fudging some of the factors, even
[01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:27.660]  if it's only three seconds, and maybe you only open it 25 times a day, that still is
[01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:32.740]  a sort of thing that it really annoys you. And so they like dug deep into it. And it
[01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:36.620]  turned out it was all the way down at like the software driver level where it had to
[01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:40.700]  get fixed, but they fixed it. And now it's like they hit the key to open the palette
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:42.620]  and the palette is instantly there.
[01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:46.220]  Jay Haynes Mm hmm. Yeah. And I think that's the kind of,
[01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:50.180]  you know, the I was obviously an anecdote, it didn't seem prepared, maybe it was. But
[01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:54.340]  you know, that kind of anecdote is like a, an example of hopefully the things that they're
[01:18:54.340 --> 01:19:00.060]  trying to suss out, but it speaks to something larger, which is that, you know, there, when
[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:04.140]  you notice matter how many like listening tours you go on, right? Like you when you
[01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:10.700]  get into a room with Apple, as a developer, or as a, you know, software engineer, or yeah,
[01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:16.740]  software engineer, or as a audio engineer, or as a as a, an editor, you know, film editor,
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:19.780]  whatever, if you get into a room with Apple, and they're like, Okay, tell us, you know,
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:23.860]  what you want, right? You're gonna go big picture, right? You're gonna go like, Oh,
[01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:29.460]  I'd love for you to support this format, or I'd love for you to, you know, to launch a
[01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:34.900]  version of it that supported, you know, my, this my dream feature, or, you know, whatever.
[01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:38.420]  And that's great. And feature requests are wonderful. And yada, yada, you know, it's
[01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:41.500]  good to have that input, which is why they do those listening tours, you know, they go
[01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:47.100]  around, you know, listening to professionals, external to the company, but it cannot give
[01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:52.340]  you the same insight into an average workflow and how that workflow is being negatively
[01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:56.980]  impacted. Or frankly, it could be just fine. And they could be finding massive ways to
[01:19:56.980 --> 01:20:00.820]  improve it, or it could be telling them, Oh, this is how people use their machines, we
[01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:06.340]  can lean into this, you know, for either future hardware or future software, updates, bug
[01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:11.300]  fixes, features, whatever. But you can't get that in a in a hour long conversation or whatever
[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:15.800]  with some pro randomly, you have to bring them in house, you have to get them to sit
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:21.220]  down and do their work. And the problem as was brought up to me was with that is that
[01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:28.020]  these people are working on proprietary stuff. And you cannot ask them to just bring the
[01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:33.500]  footage of the next season of Game of Thrones to Apple and edit it there. He can't do it
[01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:38.260]  right. It's not possible. They won't, they are not allowed by any way, shape or means.
[01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:42.820]  And so they that's the reasoning they felt for bringing people in. And I don't know exactly
[01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:47.140]  what projects they're shooting or whatever, but they're shooting literal movies and stuff
[01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:52.860]  at Apple and editing them there. And that that is, you know, informing, of course, their
[01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:56.900]  their understanding of the workflows that these people go through.
[01:20:56.900 --> 01:21:00.820]  Any hint from them? Because one thing they revealed last year at the roundtable was that
[01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:06.860]  in addition to deciding to work on an all new Mac Pro, they were also at the same time,
[01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:15.200]  working on an all new pro display, standalone display. Any any word on that? I didn't see
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:18.980]  anything in your story about it. No, I you know, I didn't mention it simply because I
[01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:23.540]  did ask and they basically said yes, that, you know, it's coming, which we already knew,
[01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:27.740]  you know, or at least they had, they had said that it was it was coming a year ago, and
[01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:31.460]  there was no major change. So you know, editing, you had to leave something out, you know,
[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:37.300]  usually and so no, basically, yes, but no, no real additional just confirmation that
[01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:40.940]  that's still part of the plan. Yeah, exactly. And you don't expect them to give you the
[01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:45.340]  details like, you know, oh, yeah, it's gonna be there was a teleconferencing screen in
[01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:52.740]  the room that was like, I don't know, 12 feet across. I was like, Is this the one? No, no.
[01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:58.860]  Do you think it's possible that it could be an 8k display?
[01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:03.380]  I think it's absolutely possible. I mean, I think the hardware is capable of driving
[01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:07.960]  it. I think you could drive an 8k display off of a MacBook Pro with an eGPU. You know,
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:13.020]  somebody is a film editor, and they want to edit 8k. And I will say that they emphasize
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:17.380]  that Final Cut Pro, the performance improvements after they stripped it to the bolts, right
[01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:22.380]  a few years ago, and have slowly built it back up. The performance improvements, which
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:27.180]  they demonstrated for me in their edit bay there, one of their edit bays, after cleaning
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:31.220]  it out, basically, it seemed very sterile for an edit bay. If you know edit bays, they're
[01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:37.100]  notoriously dirty with food and everything everywhere. And that but they showed on an
[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:45.060]  8k display, you know, the iMac Pro handling all of these streams of simultaneous footage,
[01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:52.060]  you know, 8k footage, color graded, non rendered live, you know, footage, I think, which is
[01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:55.300]  amazing. I think display is really great. I don't know how big it'll be. But I think
[01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:58.900]  it's got to be 8k because I think they just want you know, 5k they've done they did that
[01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:17.020]  years ago, you know, like, and it's still it's, yeah, I still am using my original generation iMac 5k, you know, like the first iMac 5k that came out is still my daily that's on my desk in my office. And I love it. But they've done that already, you know, so I kind of feel like
[01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:46.620]  Yeah, I mean, the 8k TVs are out there. I mean, they're in I'm not saying they're everywhere. They're not abundant, but they are, you know, the displays are out there. I think even Dell has an 8k monitor now. And the TV that they showed me was 8k. And like 8k HDR is what most people are like editing in our most, you know, modern, modern shooters who have like these red cameras and other high end cameras. And then you know, everything because then you can master it down to
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:24:16.340]  anything and it looks amazing, you know, what you have, it's future proofing, you know, you have that archive, as it let's say you shoot your movie, your feature film and 8k, you're able to then, you know, in 10 years or six years or five years, whatever, remaster that and offer it as an upgrade. It's the same thing where that happened with 4k. When, you know, Apple said, Oh, hey, iTunes can support 4k now, and all these studios came out with 4k stuff pretty quickly. Well, that didn't happen.
[01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:26.780]  You know, because they like figured out a way to make it 4k. It happened because they shot it or scanned it from film at very high res. And then we're able to offer that stream pretty quickly.
[01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:56.740]  I keep thinking in the back of my head that I sort of hope that what they're building is a modern day Mac to FX, the Mac to FX was sold from 1990 to 1992 is the fastest Mac ever made at that point. And it retailed starting price was not $9,000. So it was priced from 9000 to 12,000, according to Wikipedia, and which is bargain, which is how I recall it, I just recall it was some number that made me want to die because I was
[01:24:56.740 --> 01:25:24.020]  I was picking up my brand new Mac LC with. But the basic idea of what I'm all I mean by it is let's make the fastest computer we can make. Right. And we've got right, you know, if $10,000 computer is out of your budget, we have other we have great iMac systems for the desktop that start at a very reasonable price.
[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:53.980]  You know, let's build a machine for people who have the money and the need professionally to get something truly extraordinary. Like what could we do if we made a $15,000 Mac Pro, you know, I'm not suggesting that would be the starting price, I'm just saying, you know, but what if the starting price was quite higher than the iMac Pro, because it's so you know, and that it's worthy on the on the performance front, like the Mac to FX, you look at it, and I'll put a link to that in the description.
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:26:23.020]  I think in the show notes, it was from the beige box era at Apple, it was didn't really look all that much different, or and it certainly didn't, I wouldn't even say it looked better than other Mac twos, you know, in the Mac two family. But the performance was extraordinary. You know, and for some people, that was worth it. But the other thing that made me laugh is talking about 8k displays is look at the display on that picture from the Wikipedia thing.
[01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:52.900]  I think that's just, I don't even know what display that is. I don't think that that's a 13 inch display. It looks like it might be like a 12 inch display, like. And as this big bezel, it's so like displays have gotten so much better. It's so are bigger tire width is the tire width of the display to 18 inches. So it can't be much more than 12. Right? It's, you know, I think I might be misremembering my timeline, but it might be the
[01:26:52.900 --> 01:27:20.100]  case that in 1990, there still weren't such things as 17 inch displays, or I guess we had 15 inch for a while, too. But 13 inch might have been the most you could get. You could buy a $10,000 computer, a $10,000 computer in 1990 dollars. So it's probably at least at least like a 15 16 $17,000 computer in today's dollars. I don't want I don't even care.
[01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:24.660]  Yeah, Wikipedia says that it was equivalent to 16,800 in 2017.
[01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:30.900]  All right, there we go. So it's a $17,000 starting price in today's dollars. And you'd use it with a display.
[01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:35.420]  The pros, are you ready? With Apple's $18,000 Mac Pro?
[01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:39.700]  Right. And the best display you could get was the size of an iPad Pro.
[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:46.500]  Yeah, and about 1 1 16th resolution at the most.
[01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:50.100]  Like 640 by 480 probably. Yeah.
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:28:15.100]  Not even resolution, technically CRT. But, um, right. Yeah. I think that there's, I think there's an opportunity here to look at this. And, you know, I digress back to what I said, there was two ways they could go in one way was like, Hey, what's the best way you could build that box? Like, what if what if you could just slide the card in from the back and it would make contact and it felt beautiful to do and they're able to convince AMD.
[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:32.860]  Or Nvidia to like, you know, change architecture slightly on the cards so that they work better with the machine and, you know, whatever. Right. Who knows what they could do with their leverage, you know, to make these experiences of having this modern machine feel as good as possible, just like the modern cheese grater, let's call it right.
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:29:00.860]  Um, you know, can't cut your fingers. It's impossible. Um, don't have to screw anything in, you know, you can clip everything in, uh, dead silent, you know, whatever, whatever the water cooled, you know, et cetera. But then the other way you could think of it is like, Hey, what if, you know, the because they were very hot on GPU right now and yes, admittedly, it had just shipped, you know, support for it had just shipped and so they were highlighting it for me, just like, Hey, we've got you here.
[01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:22.620]  So we're going to show you a few things that utilize the GPU, which is totally understandable. Um, one of the demos that I got was this, you know, kind of insane, uh, you know, detailed, I mean, it wasn't that as a, it's like a, a typical graphics card stress test type thing, but it had like a planet with a bunch of asteroids around it that were actual geometry, not a particle effect.
[01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:51.620]  And, um, they pushed that on a Mac, on a Mac book pro and obviously very poor frame rates, uh, on a Mac book pro natively for a stress test like that, um, using the internal graphics card. And then, um, they did a demonstration, which was fairly impressive. If you know anything about the way that, um, systems, uh, recognize graphics cards, um, if you remove a graphics card from a system, uh, usually the computer crashes just immediately. Cause it's like, I have no idea.
[01:29:51.620 --> 01:30:21.580]  What, what you just did to me, it doesn't take it off one of the loads of my brain. Yeah, exactly. It would be like, yeah, you separated. Right. I was using the rest of your brain's like, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey. Right. Um, so you know, it's immediate shut down, just falls over like a rag doll. And it's like, I don't, whatever, man, I'm, I quit. And so with the, uh, what they demonstrated though was, um, they had two eGPU units, uh, one with the, like an AMD virus.
[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:50.580]  Uh, one had the i5 80 or something in it. And then the other one had the Vega part, uh, the one that's in the iMac pro or something like it. Uh, I think they said it was the Vega part. So, um, but that basically is like one of the beefier GPUs you can buy. And so they had those two lined up. Um, you plug in one, it takes over the rendering, um, obviously the hands off, um, any modern application, um, being a relatively new application belt for OS 10.
[01:30:50.580 --> 01:31:19.580]  I can't remember whether it works out of the box or whether there's some small change you can make to where it understands this. Um, but they also said, actually, I'll dig it. I'll get to that in a second. But yeah, so that it'll understand the handoff and says, okay, I'm stop. I'm going to quit using this GPU here on board. I'm going to start using this one. And then they had a monitor plugged into the back of the GPU, the eGPU. And then of course the monitor comes active and it's pushing that monitor, um, and also pushing the content on the, on the Mac book.
[01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:47.580]  So it's actually really clever the way they handle it. Just one Thunderbolt cable boop, right? Just plug it in. You now have a new GPU, you unplug it. And if it's an older application, it just destroyed. And if it's a new application, it completely, it handles it fine. They actually have a dialogue for older applications where it says, Hey, yo, you know, this, if you want to, if there's like, you know, a little GPU icon that appears in the bar and you, you eject it, you know, you click on the icon and eject it before you unplug it.
[01:31:47.580 --> 01:32:07.580]  And when you go to eject it, it says, wait, you're going to want to save anything you're doing here because the moment you unplug this, it's going to go into psychosis and just quit, you know, just crash on you. Um, and I told them, of course, nobody has ever removed any peripheral without first ejecting it properly. So this is going to be fine. There's no problem here at all.
[01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:31.580]  But newer applications will handle it gracefully. You unplug it. There's a small, essentially a suspend. And then it says, Hey, I'm on a new machine now. That's literally the thought process of the, of the app. It says, Oh, you just opened me up on a new machine that's configured differently with this new graphics card. And then it takes off and unsuspends and goes from there. It's like a save state.
[01:32:31.580 --> 01:33:00.580]  Um, but it happens incredibly quickly and gracefully from what I observed. Um, but then they did one further, which is that they plugged in two. So they plugged in one that was the 580 and then one that was the Vega. And so you have two Thunderbolt ports, essentially, and utilizing the bandwidth of those, you know, beefier controllers, which is the whole reason they went with four Thunderbolts and not legacy stuff, which, you know, some people will complain and whatever. I'm not your complaint department.
[01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:29.580]  But the, well, I mean, I got a bunch of flack on Twitter, like, why, you know, I don't use these GPUs. And it's like, well, I don't know, you may, you know, you never know, right? Like, maybe you will. And yeah, that's the decision that they made to enable this kind of thing. And they, they plugged in both parts, they fired it up again. And of course, you know, you could see that the most powerful one takes over. And it says, Hey, this one can handle the most load. But then they loaded up Cinema 4D, which is the most powerful one.
[01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:59.460]  And Cinema 4D, which is a 3D rendering application that is used by visual effects people to render scenes for movies or high end commercials and things like that. And you saw that. We saw that together at the iMac. The highest thought they were saying, Hey, but literally the highest of the high end visual effects. I mean, I'm not saying that there aren't competitors to Cinema 4D. I'm just saying that there are people using Cinema 4D to make, you know, movies like Star Wars, and you know, whatever else you
[01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:29.380]  Right. Right, exactly. And so the way that it worked is you plugged in both GPUs. And you had the machine. And then you told the window, the viewport, which is the way it works in 3D software, you tell a viewport to start rendering, or you tell it how you want it to render. And so you start the viewport rendering. And then what happened is they actually had three little thin green lines that popped up on the screen. And this is a Cinema 4D feature, right? It's not an OS 10 feature. But the green lines, obviously, supported by OS 10.
[01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:59.260]  popped up on the viewport. And it essentially showed you a slice of the viewport was being given to each GPU. And I asked them whether it was we like this was allegorical, you know, or actual. And I think it's actual, but if somebody out there wants to correct me, that's totally fine. You know, that's that's all good. But the basically a small sliver of the viewport on the left, which was this was a car dashboard that they were
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:28.860]  rendering a picture of a car dashboard. And so the small sliver on the left, which is just a strip of like pebbled, you know, plastic texture was being rendered by the GPU of the MacBook, then a larger chunk was being rendered. And it's like, you know, everything to the right of that green line is being rendered by the 580. And then the largest chunk of the viewport was being rendered by the Vega part. So it's essentially allowed you to like utilize three GPUs at once, just by plugging them in. And then it would portion out the
[01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:32.980]  work to whatever, you know, load that there's each can handle.
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:36:02.900]  I like I just like the idea of the of the built in. Was it a MacBook? Right? I love the idea of the MacBook Pro. The MacBook's built in GPU is like I can help fellas. Yeah, exactly. That was basically it. It was a tiny sliver. Yeah, let me let me help out, guys. You want me to get you coffee? I'll handle the notifications menu. Give me the notifications. I'll handle those for you boys. If you get an iPad.
[01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:32.900]  message while we're doing this. But that that was very interesting to me this philosophy of like, hey, you know, how much compute power do you need GPU wise, you know, for a GPU bound instruction. And, and you can have that instantly and not have it when you don't want it when you want to move away from your desk or walk away or carry your work with you or whatever. It's not about like, okay, you got to transform files and do all this stuff. Like if you're doing truly GPU bound work, you can get a
[01:36:32.900 --> 01:37:02.780]  MacBook Pro and still do that work, which is amazing. And if it's especially if it's not very CPU bound, your two year old MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt, you know, by the time GPUs really get out there, your two year old MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt three is an immensely capable machine for rendering work and stuff still, like the effectively extended the life of people's MacBook Pros massively, or enable them to do things that they they wouldn't be able to do otherwise. And it works forever.
[01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:13.180]  They worked for gaming. If you got a MacBook Pro and you want to game, there's this company that makes this little puck thing that you can take with you and plug it into your machine in a hotel room and boom, you got a gaming rig.
[01:37:13.180 --> 01:37:42.220]  And that works. That works now. That works today. Cool. Yeah, yeah, it just the OS X, the latest update to OS X enabled the GPU support. Apple has two pages up on the website about it, one that's developer focused and then one that's consumer focused. So you could check on the website. I don't know what the exact URLs are off the top of my head. I put it in the show notes. But yeah, it's basically like, hey, here's, you know, take your machine running the latest version of OS X that obviously has the ports to support it.
[01:37:42.220 --> 01:38:08.300]  And you're golden, you know, plug it in, and it'll know what to do, it'll take over that. Obviously, if you have stuff where the CPU is handling a lot of additional computation, it's still being limited, you know, to you and to the age of your computer. But the fact that it can say, hey, give me this beefy ass job, I'll figure out which GPU to throw it to whether it's the one on board or the one off board.
[01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:26.300]  And you plug this into your fantastic high resolution monitor, put your MacBook in a clamshell, and it's like you're using a much beefier machine. To me, seeing it live and the way that they're just swapping in and out and all of that. It says a hell of a lot to me about the way they think about modularity.
[01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:56.220]  Yeah. So I don't know that the new Mac, I mean, don't believe me, to be honest, I say all of this. And then I'm like, don't believe me because I was the person who had the original Mac Pro was coming up that trash kid thing. My feeling was like, oh, it's gonna be modular, all modular, right? And like, they're gonna be you're gonna plug in your GPU if you want it and, and hell, maybe even the cinema display will have its own GPU, which that doesn't make any guidance says because then you got to replace your CPU, your cinema display, you know, so don't listen to me about this. But I did find it compelling.
[01:38:56.300 --> 01:39:25.980]  And interesting, you know, to see that happen live, right? I thought it was cool. And it does sound philosophically Apple like Apple likes to ship devices that you don't go inside. And I'm not saying that you're not gonna be able to open your Mac, new Mac Pro. I mean, I'm not, but I'm just saying if most of the quote unquote modularity is a philosophically about plugging in external GPUs, and then other external things, that sounds more
[01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:55.620]  Apple like to me philosophically, then put a card in the case, you know, shut that machine down, unplug it, put a card in the case, hot swap ability, just plug it, unplug it, you know, you're doing this stuff, you know, that requires, you know, the best external GPU money can buy. But you're, you've got to get out of the office because the cleaning people are coming through, we're going to be running vacuum cleaners and stuff. So you just unplug go to a coffee shop for an hour and work on something, an aspect of the project
[01:39:55.620 --> 01:40:23.380]  that's not GPU intensive, you know, you're like at the wireframe level or something. But that you just unplug it and pick up your MacBook and go, that's actually kind of amazing. Like you don't have to say, you don't have to save, shuffle the files around and switch to a different machine, because now you're on a MacBook and open this thing up. And, you know, you could just go to a different part of the building and, you know, just keep using the machine.
[01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:52.580]  Right. And you could do setups like a lot of the stuff they talked about, some of it was with logic as well, but a lot of the stuff they talked about was, you know, being able to do setups and things like that. I mean, think about it, like, from a rendering perspective, like the MacBook Pro can handle a decent amount of geometry, you know, in bare polygonal form, right, or wireframe or whatever. So you could do a lot of setups and play around and all of this stuff. And then when you're ready to render, you have that.
[01:40:53.380 --> 01:41:23.300]  At your fingertips, but it doesn't mean you need it all the time. And in fact, for bigger units where you have, like, you know, two GPUs plugged in and you're rendering or you're basically treating it as a rendering farm, a miniature one. And I was talking to some smart people in, I don't think it's, I don't know if it's secret or not, but I was really talking to some smart folks that work at like Pixar and whatnot. And they were saying that there's probably a really nice market in between a company like Pixar that has its own world.
[01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:53.340]  render farm, or another VFX house, which uses AWS or one of the bigger server services like Google's, which a lot of them do now. And then then all the way down to the person who's just using their onboard GPU. In other words, there's probably a really solid mark long tail market for people that need GPU bound instruction stuff work done that, you know, want to build their own miniature render farm. And you could do a render, you know, build a little render farm for yourself with just a few of those
[01:41:53.340 --> 01:42:12.660]  GPUs for a few grand and have quite a good time of it, you know, turnaround wise and getting your proofs out and all of that, even if you used for your final render, you used a bigger farm, you know, or spun up servers, you could definitely get your dailies out of that, so to speak. So it's it's very, very interesting compelling for for certain types of pros.
[01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:42.460]  What do you think I this is where I'm going over my head because I'm not a gamer and I'm not a 3d professional. What is the deal? So it's like the even the iMac Pro comes with Radeon, the Vega 56 and the Vega 64 graphics processor. What's the deal with Apple's relationship with Nvidia? Like, because it seems to me like there's some people who prefer Nvidia for I don't know if it but it's like Apple's never really had a good relationship with
[01:42:42.460 --> 01:43:12.300]  them. Wasn't there a thing like many, many years ago in the Steve Jobs era where Nvidia blew a there was like a Mac coming out with an Nvidia card and Nvidia pre announced it before Apple did and they were like, screw them. I don't remember that. I'm sorry. I could be misremembering. But what do you make of that? Is that is it? Is it a thing or is it not a thing? You mean like the Nvidia versus Apple type thing? Yeah. Or and it does the new Mac Pro need to
[01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:13.380]  support Nvidia?
[01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:43.060]  Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah. Um, I mean, I sure as heck would like it to I mean, I think that there's a lot of, you know, Nvidia is thinking correctly about a lot of stuff and they are smart. I mean, they, the Nvidia and all GPUs sort of got really kind of blindsided by the cryptocurrency crypto industry at large, you know, and they really, you know, we're steam rolled in and really skewed the prices
[01:43:43.060 --> 01:44:12.940]  and availability and everything of all these cards. And so I think they're still kind of dealing with being that and trying to establish a place for themselves among purpose built AI processing as well, like AI CPUs, because CPUs that are purpose built for AI or co processors that are purposeful for AI is a huge thing. And it's gonna be like the next big wave in chip growth. At least that's the conjecture. But I think that they are, they are in a position of strength when it comes to games and gamers on
[01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:42.780]  all of that, because it but they do support, you know, Mac, right? Like they and they have for a while, the Nvidia GPUs have supported Mac, since I mean, like early last year, I think there was a nice wave of like additional support for Mac. So I don't think that there's any acrimony there. I don't know if it's an absolute must that it should support Nvidia cards, but I sure as hell would hope so. I would say that like, you know, if eGPU that's Nvidia, like, there's no reason that should work any different.
[01:44:43.620 --> 01:45:10.020]  From an AMD GPU that you plug into your dear machine. So I'd say it's a must that that works. But I don't know whether or not they will use the part if it's of that model where the cards are internal, you know, they may just go with one partner. And that partner at this point will probably be MD. I mean, it's on the wall, right? The alternative is, of course, is that there have been rumblings forever that Apple wants to build their own GPU.
[01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:31.220]  Yeah, but I think that will come very, very, very far down the road for anything but their smartphones, or their small devices, their compact devices, because that's where all of the advantages, like power, you know, and battery usage have come into play. That's what they're building it for. They're not building it because they can make the most powerful one. They're building it purpose built.
[01:45:31.220 --> 01:46:00.660]  Yeah. All right, let me take a break here and thank our third and final sponsor of this show. Squarespace.

[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:32.180]  longtime support of the talk show. Alright, you mentioned that there's rumors that Apple might want is getting into making their own GPUs. They started doing that with the iPhone. The other recent rumor that I think we have to talk about is there was a Bloomsburg Bloomberg report a week or two ago that said Apple plans to ship to their own it switch the Mac to their own in house chips starting in 2020.
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:49:01.200]  Which people have inspected. This is, you know, the timing, you know, saying putting a specific year on it is obviously news. But I mean, you'd have to be you have your head in the sand or not, you know, be totally ignorant not to have been thinking, you know, ever since the Apple a series chips started coming out for the iPhone, that Apple might switch to doing their own chips for everything. Because Apple likes to have control and Apple has different priorities than the rest of the industry.
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:31.120]  There have been Macs over the years that have been held up by Intel's ability to ship on time. You know, so it makes all the sense in the world as a simple, would they do this if they could? Yes, of course they would. The question is, and I've gotten it from a lot of people you probably have to is do you think this new Mac Pro that's not coming until next year? Is that the explanation for why the new Mac Pro is
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:50:00.880]  incoming till next year? Because it'll be the first thing that they build in house, you know, but the in house CPUs or whatever? I think the answer to that is a definite no. And here's why. Because 2019 is not 2020. You know, and so however much, however much faith you put in the Bloomberg story, which Mark Gurman, I forget who else's byline was on it. But I really, really doubt that if that story is
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:30.640]  completely true, I really doubt that it's going to come out early. You know, like, I would guess that if the current plan, if there really is a plan, if that story is completely true, and Apple is planning to ship to in house design CPUs for Macs it by 2020. I think that that means it'll come 2020 at the earliest, and maybe, you know, 2021. Because, you know, these things sometimes take longer than you think they will. And if they're already saying, and they started last year on on
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:59.920]  a new Mac Pro, that has to be two separate things, right? It just doesn't make any sense to me that they would be related. I sort of think this is people just desperately trying to understand the how hard can it be to ship a workstation? Like, right, not so much that they want this to be true. It's not so much that they they've thought through all of the technical aspects of it, like, would these be a series arm chips? And would this, you know, all the complications that that would entail
[01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:04.040]  of, you know, having a new process, a new architecture for the max?
[01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:34.000]  Blah, blah, blah, forget that. I mean, arm is just not designed for high power, you know, use it, it would basically be a redesign chip completely. I mean, we're talking like, it can't be any iteration of what they built before, because arm is specifically Apple went with arm not because it was different, right? But because very specifically, it's sipped power, right? And it's, you know, useful for making devices like iPads and phones and watches. Right?
[01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:50.480]  Like, like, what makes Apple's in house design team so good at, like, wow, this new series three Apple Watch, so so much faster than just two years ago. Like, right, that skill set doesn't really translate to let's render a scene from the new Star Wars movie.
[01:51:50.480 --> 01:52:20.240]  Jay Haynes Yeah, I mean, it doesn't. I will say like the chip T on the subject of the chip team. I don't care how many times it has come up, or somebody has posted some fluff piece about like, oh, Apple's chip team or whatever. I don't care how many of those you publish. I don't think anybody understands exactly how amazing that team is. And I'm not saying this to blow smoke. I'm talking about the individuals involved, like Apple is assembled an insane group of talent in that team. And like,
[01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:50.120]  everybody had talked to who actually knows what the hell they're talking about, is like, that team is a beast. Like it is there. Not only is their output insane, like the amount of improvements that they're building on processors that nobody else has, right? Like this is not where they can, oh, we'll take this design and improve on it 10%. Right? Like they are literally building purpose built brand new chips at a very rapid clip and making them better and better and better. It is very impressive output for a chip design team, which is chip design
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:53:19.400]  is like one of the hardest things to do in tech and hard tech. You know, it's like the the pinnacle of difficult always has been engineering level, right? Because somebody, whether if you take your if you make a misstep as a chip maker, or just, you know, start resting on your laurels, somebody else is going to stay at the history of the computer industry showing that somebody else is going to come in with their pedal to the metal and make a chip that is the state of the art in every aspect, you know,
[01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:44.960]  you know, and, and eat your lunch, right? Right. Yeah, I think these are two totally unrelated stories. If it's true that Apple is switching to in house chips, whether they are arm or they're their own in house x86 or whatever. I don't think that has any relation to a Mac Pro that started being engineered last year. I mean, I'm sure if they have this
[01:53:44.960 --> 01:54:06.640]  roadmap, have a hard time believing it, right? For sure. I'm sure that they're, you know, it. I'm sure they're also not happening in isolation, because I'm sure that it's john, you know, john tournes's team at Apple doing hardware if this is true, and I have no idea. But if it is true that there is a plan to switch to in house CPUs in 2020. I'm sure he's already aware of this.
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:36.560]  I think those Venn diagrams significantly overlap. Yeah, right. I'm pretty sure. And so I'm sure they're thinking about it. But I don't think that, you know, you know, there's an art to shipping, whether it's software or hardware, right. And it's, you know, to ship one of these in 2019, you've got to, you know, you start cutting things off early, you know, like, okay, we'll use this, we'll use this, we'll use this. And using in house CPUs that don't exist yet. So I think that's a really important thing.
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:55:05.760]  Isn't something you can do now to ship in 2019. Right. Right. Exactly. Yeah, good luck with that one. I don't believe that either. I think it's definitely something along the lines of, you know, the GPU in their own iDevices thing. That's not theirs, either. Right. It's not a completely Apple built part yet, by by any means, but it is certainly closer to custom, whatever you want to call it.
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:16.240]  You know, they did a lot of work on that, and they will continue to fully convinced that at some point, they will be their own in house GPU. Right now, I think it still uses a lot of
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:44.880]  templatization and in kind of similar structures as other existing GPUs. But the fact that they're building that thing is a given, and the fact that they're working on other chips is a given. But like, if you look at that situation, I can imagine that if they chose like a manufacturer, an x86 manufacturer of some sort, to build the CPUs in that, let's say it's Intel. And they're going to build them a chip for that computer. I can imagine them having to build a chip for that computer.
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:56:05.840]  I can imagine them having extensive custom requirements that make it wildly different than a normal off the shelf Intel part, right? You know, for this for this release in the future, you know, whatever, but definitely I don't believe that there's going to be like some anal arm part in this in this pro computer. No.
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:33.840]  I wouldn't be surprised now Apple's gone through two major CPU transitions with the Mac and the first max ran on Motorola 6800 family chips, or 68,000 family chips. And then in the 90s, they switched to the PowerPC platform. And they switched everything not all at once. But you know, in the course of a year, everything went from being Motorola 68,000 base to PowerPC.
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:55.840]  based. And gosh, I even forget what it was called. But there was a, you know, but you could run your 68,000 software in emulation for a couple of years. So that's, you know, what, what apps am I going to use if nothing's been recompiled yet. And then they sort of did the same thing when they switched in 2005 from the PowerPC to Intel. And they had a, they had a, you know, a
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:57:19.840]  I remember the name of that one that was called Rosetta. And Rosetta would let you run your PowerPC code. And I don't believe it was I think, technically speaking, and I'm sure John Sirkusa will appreciate my exactitude here. It was not an emulator, it was a transcoder, like it transcoded 68,000 and 68,000 instruction sets.
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:37.840]  to know, I mean, PowerPC instruction set to Intel on the fly. But effectively, it's an emulator and from the user's perspective, but then again, and within a year, the entire product line had been moved to Intel, like every single Mac, you know, after the first one shipped a year later, when you go in an Apple store, every Mac was on an Intel processor.
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:53.840]  I'm not 100% sure if they switch to ARM chips in house designed ARM chips for Macs, I'm not sure that they would switch all of them, I could see them. And I, I think that I don't think the developer story would be all that complicated by it. I mean, it, it might be because you'd have to be able to switch all of them.
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:58:19.840]  I'm not 100% sure if they switch to ARM chips for Macs, I'm not sure that they would switch all of them. I could see them. And I, I think that I don't think the developer story would be all that complicated by it. I mean, it, it might be because you'd have to be able to, you might have a lot of games, for example, that only run on the x86 Max and don't run on the just plain MacBook that has an Apple designed ARM CPU.
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:41.840]  I don't know, that might be too confusing for people. But philosophically, I could see them doing that because the, like the MacBook, I think would be a better computer if it had iPads CPU, the iPad Pro CPU, then the Intel whatever wimpy whatever it has.
[01:58:41.840 --> 01:59:04.840]  But I don't, I could see them saying, but then at the high end for like the iMac Pro and for the upcoming Mac Pro and stuff that, you know, we'll just stick with Intel and let them do what they do best, which is the high performance stuff. I don't know. I could be wrong. It might just be that if they do switch, they will switch everything and they'll figure out a way to get high performance. I don't know.
[01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:28.840]  I didn't spend much time on this rumor. Yeah, I think it's an interesting one. And it's, it's as it's compelling every time it comes up, because people are like, well, hopefully they're thinking this and it's not just from a shock and awe perspective, right? Which is like, Oh, yeah, they're switching from Intel and it's gonna upset the business world. That's all fine, right? But it doesn't really matter to most users.
[01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:43.840]  And I think that the, the compelling part of it is what could Apple accomplish if it was freed from, you know, completely from Intel architecture and able to do to build a processor that was part and parcel with every other decision they made on their hardware.
[01:59:43.840 --> 02:00:12.840]  And if it's not at a point where that they could do that, and then where that contributes to significant gains in performance, or, frankly, if it's Apple, we're talking about whether the fans turn on or not. You know, if they could feel that they could get a significant lead in that stuff, and users will notice a difference. That is when it makes sense. And I think there's a lot of attention paid to Oh, when will they switch away from Intel without considering the why?
[02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:41.840]  So much, right? You know, like the why would they you know, and, and yes, part of it is fiscal, right? Like if they can, if they can do their own in and have their own whitelist providers make their own chips, they don't have to rely on Intel, there's only so many foundries in the world, though. And I'm sure they're already getting a pretty damn good deal. And so the the financial aspects of it are just going to be relatively speaking, although it will probably be the size of a small company of its own, right?
[02:00:41.840 --> 02:01:04.840]  will be a relatively drop in the bucket for Apple. And so I think it would all really hinge on performance based or experience based improvements. And, you know, that is where you have to like concentrate your ideas and your thoughts. And just for me, like, there's not a lot of clear ones on a desktop right away, you know, in that regard.
[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:26.840]  And I think we've seen from the co processor aspect of the, the MacBook Pro, that Apple has charted a way forward for them to be able to do things like utilize stuff purpose built for arm on iOS, like, you know, the face, let's say face ID, for instance, they've charted a course forward for them to be able to do that without switching wholesale.
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:42.840]  So they bought themselves some time or whatever you want to call it. So I don't know if the transition is as eminent as it seems, or if there's something else going on, where they have another class of compute device that is going to be using an ARM computer, all the aka new product lines.
[02:01:42.840 --> 02:02:00.840]  I think it's safe to say that all the other high end phones use Qualcomm Snapdragon processors, if Apple's in house, like a series processors weren't notably superior, and had, you know, many advantages probably cost included, since they don't have to, you know, they're in control of it.
[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:14.840]  If they were just roughly equivalent to the current generation snapdragons, I don't think I think Apple would shut the effort down, you know, like, they're not doing it just so they can have their own, you know, put a cool name on it, like a 12 nitro.
[02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:36.840]  I don't know, whatever they're gonna call this year's chip. They're not doing it just so they can put a name on it. They're doing it because it's an advantage, you know, we'll undertake this incredible expense and effort of designing our own personal chips, but we're doing it because we're getting, you know, and the end result that the customer has in their hands is going to be a better product.
[02:02:36.840 --> 02:03:05.840]  Right. And I think that the experience or advantage often expresses itself in ways that are not obvious to users, or frankly, even analysts, in many cases. Once you explain it, you know, everybody sort of the meme catches on and the, you know, people understand. But like the recent chip, what the hell is it called? It's not fusion. It's not, that's a drives.
[02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:07.840]  No, it's just a fusion. It is a fusion.
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:08.840]  What's the buzzword?
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:09.840]  I thought it was fusion.
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:10.840]  Is it?
[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:11.840]  Yeah.
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:12.840]  A11?
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:13.840]  Yeah, A11 fusion.
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:20.840]  It is? Okay. So this A11 chip, they said bionic. It's bionic.
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:22.840]  No, no, no. I thought that was the A10.
[02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:23.840]  Is it?
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:24.840]  Yeah.
[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:25.840]  I thought it was A11.
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:26.840]  I think it was A10.
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:27.840]  A11 bionic. No, no, no. It's A11 bionic.
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:28.840]  Alright.
[02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:51.840]  Which just goes to show you how dumb these names are, right? Those names are really just to kind of say, hey, like it's, you know, this is a new version of the chip. And we want you to know that there's more going on here than just a new chip. And there is more, right? It is, it does have dedicated sections of the chip that are used for things like security and used for things like processing, specifically, machine learning style instructions.
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:04:03.840]  You know, I talked earlier about the AI chips being bigger and bigger things. And by AI, I really mean at this point, machine learning and computational chips that are designed to run these types of instructions very efficiently.
[02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:17.840]  And to see a large portion of the reason the bionic works the way it does or is the way it is, is because it could do things like it can handle instructions that are not, that don't need a full cycle and it can run them, you know, sort of more efficiently.
[02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:29.840]  Because a lot of these, a lot of machine learning instructions are like really low rent, you know, not high powered instructions, but you need to run an absolute junk ton of them.
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:42.840]  And so it allows you to run these instructions on essentially a half of what a normal swing would be, you know, it'd be like a batter going up to the plate and you're like, we really do not want you to hit a home run on this one.
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:51.840]  We need you to hit it between third and fourth, right? Or between second and third base. Third and fourth. That's hilarious. Between second and third base. I just invented a base.
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:05:00.840]  We need you to hit it there, out there. And this is going to do wonders for our strategy. It's exactly what we need right now. And you have that hitter who's like, no problem.
[02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:07.840]  You know, I could hit this home run for you, but this is what you want. And so here it is. And so it hits those base hits because the swing is shorter.
[02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:13.840]  And you can hit, you know, 50 or 100 of those at the time it takes them to hit one home run. And that is what's going on here.
[02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:31.840]  So that is then if you spool that out, what it allows Apple to do is run a lot of these instructions on device and do things like figure out who's faces or who's or whatever, without popping it up to the cloud and making the cloud run all these instructions instead.
[02:05:31.840 --> 02:05:51.840]  And that, of course, dovetails with their security and privacy angle with their whole philosophy and all of this stuff. And these types of interconnected tissues of the decisions that Apple makes on a hardware level are not only not possible, but not even in the realm of like understanding for most companies that built like an Android phone or another mobile device.
[02:05:51.840 --> 02:06:01.840]  Not I'm not saying those phones are bad. I'm not saying that people that like them are horrible human beings. I'm just saying that, like, you cannot do this on those devices.
[02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:09.840]  And now you will be able to eventually, right? Because usually Apple does the thing. And then, you know, a year or two later, everybody figures out how to do it. And that's great.
[02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:25.840]  But right now, these purpose built devices each year that come out like chips and all this stuff are built in this way where they're not just saying, oh, we built this because X, it's we built this because X, Y, Z, alpha, beta, gamma, delta, all connect to this.
[02:06:25.840 --> 02:06:37.840]  And that, I think, is the way you got to look at their chip design, the way you got to look at the desktop. If they're going to switch to ARM, it's not going to be because, you know, one win.
[02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:44.840]  It has to be a dozen wins on different angles. And not all those wins will be evident right up front.
[02:06:44.840 --> 02:07:13.840]  It feels like a show. It feels like we've covered this completely. I'll just say I just feel like this whole thing. And again, I'll go back to what I said before that I felt like your story was such good news for people who love the Mac and who are really, you know, again, to abuse a term that I sometimes cringe at, but I don't know what else to say power users of various sorts, who feel like whose big fear is that Apple is moving to this everybody will use an iPad and like it mentality.
[02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:28.840]  I just felt like your story and this commitment they have to the pro market shows how committed they are to the Mac. And maybe not the Mac exactly as we know it, but the Mac that has these Mac like aspects that aren't like iOS that we know.
[02:07:28.840 --> 02:07:41.840]  Because I don't see iOS devices moving to support extra external GPUs. It just doesn't make sense. You know, right. I mean, you know, in the near term,
[02:07:41.840 --> 02:08:10.840]  I, you know, I'll be honest. No, probably not. But, you know, an iPad Pro with an eGPU would be pretty cool. You know, and then that's, that's one with like, just a last addendum to the whole discussion about that, that thing, you know, that, but that story is that one of the things that they showed me, which was very cool there, and which does also tap into the way that Apple thinks about pros and pro computers and, you know, kind of follows along with this GPU.
[02:08:10.840 --> 02:08:28.840]  eGPU line of reasoning is that they had a an iMac Pro, they're running logic, and they had two iPad Pros paired to it wirelessly. And I was told you could pair up to five devices wirelessly to an iMac Pro on logic, you know, I think all you know, all of the above work with up to five devices.
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:47.840]  And, you know, everybody's encouraged to buy four, five iPad Pros with every iMac purchase, of course. But you could put them together. And what the way they were using them is that they they were up to the left to the right of the iMac, and they had logic displays, they were served by logic.
[02:08:47.840 --> 02:09:12.840]  But they were not the same displays that you saw on the iMac, they were purpose built for iPad screens. And they those screens could show you, you know, large tappable buttons that allowed you to do things like time, you know, do like, you know, either metronome metronome timing, jump to a particular portion in a track, do a scratch pad, you know, whatever the case may be, whatever you need to do to tweak your stuff that works better by touch.
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:27.840]  And to do things like reference the manual live. I mean, you could hover over a device or a knob on the iMac, and the manual would live update to that particular section for that knob on the iPad Pro. It was really cool.
[02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:42.840]  That's very cool. And then you could just like just an iPad wireless that you could pick it up and just like if you wanted to read about that setting, you know, you could just like pick it up and take a stretch and walk around with the iPad. You don't have to like unplug it or unmount it. It sounds pretty cool. Yep.
[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:55.840]  Yeah, I mean, it's it was neat. And it's just, and I'm not saying this will work for everybody. And some people are gonna be like, ah, you know, my work does not use, you know, there's no feasible way I could possibly utilize that setup in my work. But that just goes back to this thing and pros are diverse.
[02:09:55.840 --> 02:10:11.840]  And most of them just wanted to work in the way that feels right in their workflow. And I think iPad Pros have a lot to do with that and will have a lot to do with that in the future. And it really typified why Apple believes that touchscreen Macs are not in its immediate future.
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:41.820]  You know, they're not the way it wants to go. It's instead, why not take this touchscreen that is incredibly high resolution and incredibly responsive, that, you know, adding to a Mac would not be feasible and or, you know, cost wise effective. And utilize that, you know, if you want to do touch there, you could, you know, activate your your all of your controls you want on there, walk around and control your Mac with it while you're producing music or whatever. And then when you want to walk away from it, you can walk away and use GarageBand.
[02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:42.800]  You know, and then come back.
[02:10:42.800 --> 02:11:12.300]  I know, I just I'm so glad I thought of it. There's one more point I wanted to make. And you mentioned it explicitly, I think, somebody at Apple told you this, but that one of the reasons they wanted to, hey, call you in and get this story out that the new Mac Pro is going to be next year thing is that they're aware that people are making buying decisions now. And if you've been thinking, well, I need a new pro desktop, and the new iMac Pro looks like I could, I could make do with that. But maybe I'll hold my breath.
[02:11:12.300 --> 02:11:38.100]  And wait for this Mac Pro. If you need work, you know, something for this year, you know, now, you know, get them, you know, rig out a iMac Pro. And I think that's pretty cool. And it's definitely a new Apple thing, right? Like, Apple has not in the past, been all that interested in helping people with their buying decisions when there are curiously long in the tooth products in the in the, you know,
[02:11:38.100 --> 02:12:08.060]  Yeah, everybody's got to be the tea leaves. And I don't think it makes for a very welcoming environment for institutional buyers. I really don't think that that like, I think you're absolutely correct that it was expectation setting and all of that stuff. But I don't think that it was necessarily even aimed at the individual buyer, you know, because the individual buyer at this point, they're going to take away from this, you know, exactly the same thing. But it really was aimed at those institutional buyers who are like, I have a 2018 budget, do I spend it?
[02:12:08.100 --> 02:12:37.380]  Now? Or wait? That's really their simple question. And they'll find ways to spend it, whether that's on iMac Pros or, or some other thing that they need to spend it on this year. But it's a message saying, if you've got a budget set aside, utilize it, utilize it for other Apple products, other Apple products, hopefully, obviously. But then in 2019, you know, earmark your budget for the Mac Pros that you've been waiting for. We're talking research, we're talking, you know,
[02:12:37.380 --> 02:13:07.260]  schools, we're talking, you know, R&D departments, you know, these places that really need this raw compute power that buy a bunch at a time, you know, movie studios, whatever you want to call it. And these production houses, wait, buy it in 2019. Don't worry about, you know, saving your budget now in 2018, spend it on what you got. And then when you get your new budget for 2019, you know what to look for. That's really the major market
[02:13:07.260 --> 02:13:08.020]  it was aimed at, I think.
[02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:26.860]  All right, Matthew, thank you so much for your time. Thank you for writing such a great story. I'm so glad you came here to talk about it.
