[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  How is sunny California?
[00:02.000 --> 00:06.000]  It's great. I mean, it was snowing in Montreal this week before I left,
[00:06.000 --> 00:10.000]  which is just climate chaos, and then I got here and it was a heatwave, so it's great.
[00:10.000 --> 00:13.000]  Ah, so anyway, you are out there, I don't know what else you're doing,
[00:13.000 --> 00:18.000]  but I know yesterday you were at the grand opening of the new,
[00:18.000 --> 00:21.000]  or I guess it's not really the grand opening, I guess that's tomorrow,
[00:21.000 --> 00:28.000]  but the sort of preview opening of the new flagship Apple Store in San Francisco,
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.000]  right at the top of the hill at Union Square.
[00:31.000 --> 00:34.000]  Yeah, they did a sort of a preview event. It's opening officially on Saturday.
[00:34.000 --> 00:38.000]  It's when the general public can go and we'll see how normal people react to the store,
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  especially when they're at capacity.
[00:40.000 --> 00:43.000]  But they had a small event yesterday with Angela Ahrens, which was very nice.
[00:43.000 --> 00:45.000]  So tell me about it.
[00:45.000 --> 00:48.000]  Well, the thing that was remarkable to me up front is they brought us in
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  and they said Angela was going to speak,
[00:50.000 --> 00:54.000]  and there was all this Internet stuff previously about why is Apple hiding Angela Ahrens?
[00:54.000 --> 00:58.000]  Why isn't Apple showcasing her? Why isn't she on the stage?
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.000]  Is she even around anymore?
[01:00.000 --> 01:03.000]  And you knew that that was bullshit because you see her on campus.
[01:03.000 --> 01:07.000]  She's a presence at Apple. She's everywhere. She does phenomenal work.
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.000]  But she came out, and it was very similar to how I remember Johnny Ive coming out
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.000]  for the Unibody MacBook event many years ago,
[01:14.000 --> 01:17.000]  where she said flatly that it's not her favorite thing to do.
[01:17.000 --> 01:20.000]  And she asked for a bottle of water and she got talking,
[01:20.000 --> 01:23.000]  and she's so passionate that she wanted to do this,
[01:23.000 --> 01:27.000]  and clearly being on an Apple keynote stage is not top of her personal list of things.
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.000]  Oh, interesting. Maybe that's the simple explanation
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.000]  for why we haven't seen her on stage more often, that she doesn't want to be.
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  Just like Johnny. I mean, not everyone wants to do that stuff.
[01:39.000 --> 01:43.000]  Yeah, I think people...
[01:43.000 --> 01:46.000]  For all of the...
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  And some of it certainly warranted all of the debate
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.000]  over the diversity of the people who are on stage at Apple events.
[01:54.000 --> 01:57.000]  It's easy to overlook the fact that a lot of people really,
[01:57.000 --> 02:02.000]  not just don't like it, but really have...
[02:02.000 --> 02:08.000]  It's so stressful to go and speak in front of an audience that it's undesirable.
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.000]  They just don't want to do it.
[02:10.000 --> 02:13.000]  Yeah, or they work. I mean, like Craig Federighi, he was not great the first year he did it,
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.000]  but he got better and better every year at it,
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.000]  and some of that is just they're going to have to give people that time,
[02:18.000 --> 02:21.000]  opportunities, and maybe smaller events like this is a good way to do it.
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.000]  They can sort of get comfortable with it and then become very good at those jobs.
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  There's that... I think it's Malcolm Gladwell who's got this theory
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.000]  that it takes 10,000 hours to get good at something,
[02:32.000 --> 02:34.000]  which, you know, roll your eyes, because it's Malcolm Gladwell,
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  and it's sort of anecdotal, but with Craig Federighi,
[02:37.000 --> 02:39.000]  it's like he needed like an hour and a half.
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  Yes.
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  He needed like... He had like one...
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  His first time he came back was, I think it was the Back to the Mac event that was at Town Hall.
[02:48.000 --> 02:52.000]  I was not there. I actually watched that one remotely.
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.000]  And he was doing the demos of these features on a Mac,
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  and his hands were literally shaking.
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.000]  He really couldn't do the mousing required to do the demo.
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  He was like clicking wrong because his hands were so shaky.
[03:08.000 --> 03:13.000]  It was almost hard to watch as, you know, unless, you know...
[03:13.000 --> 03:16.000]  It's hard to watch somebody who's that nervous speaking.
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  Then like the next time he came out, he was much better.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  And then by the third time he did an event, he's like,
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.000]  wow, he might be the best public speaker in the company.
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.000]  Yeah, it was phenomenal.
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.000]  And they had... I'm blanking on her name right now,
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.000]  but the woman who... the vice president of Apple Pay was just phenomenal first time out.
[03:32.000 --> 03:33.000]  Yeah.
[03:33.000 --> 03:34.000]  The person covering you is really good too.
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  I mean, they make jokes about some of our sports illustrated.
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.000]  Phenomenal. And that kind of stuff I'm really eager to see more of.
[03:39.000 --> 03:40.000]  Yeah.
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.000]  So tell me about the store itself.
[03:43.000 --> 03:46.000]  So what I loved about this is that in typical Apple fashion,
[03:46.000 --> 03:49.000]  most companies would just... they would give anything to have a business like Apple Store.
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  Never mind a business like Apple. It's such a valuable property.
[03:52.000 --> 03:55.000]  It does so many billions of dollars in transactions.
[03:55.000 --> 03:57.000]  Really a beloved retail experience.
[03:57.000 --> 04:00.000]  And messing with that is super scary because you do anything wrong,
[04:00.000 --> 04:03.000]  you risk damaging that business. And that's big business for Apple.
[04:03.000 --> 04:07.000]  But they don't just, oh, I think we'll make the Genius Bar three inches longer.
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.000]  We'll change the wood. We'll do all these incremental things to improve them.
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  We'll make the quality of the screens better.
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  They rethought everything from the beginning.
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.000]  So it was Angela Aaron's team and Johnny Ive's team and the companies that they worked with.
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  And they brought everything back to the essence.
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  And it wasn't, you know, do we keep the theaters or do we ax the theaters
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.000]  or do we do something with the Genius Bars?
[04:26.000 --> 04:29.000]  What is our core principle? What governs... what we're going to do with Apple Stores?
[04:29.000 --> 04:34.000]  And she mentioned that Apple Store is the biggest product that Apple ships to customers.
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.000]  And they've had a long history, but Apple Online now does so much.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  People can just go there and order.
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  And they don't necessarily have to go to stores anymore to do that.
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.000]  And likewise, support.apple.com and Apple Support on Twitter
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  handle a lot of the low-level queries now.
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  So if you just have a software issue or you just need help or how-to information,
[04:52.000 --> 04:57.000]  they handle all that. So it's not necessary for the Genius Bars to do the same load they used to do.
[04:57.000 --> 05:01.000]  So they wanted to figure out what made the Apple Store relevant to customers these days,
[05:01.000 --> 05:03.000]  what would make them actually want to go there.
[05:03.000 --> 05:05.000]  And they settled on this overarching theme of community,
[05:05.000 --> 05:09.000]  that the Apple Store could be the central hub of the Apple community.
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.000]  And it starts with those giant 40-foot doors on both sides that,
[05:12.000 --> 05:14.000]  yeah, make your Apple car drive-through jokes.
[05:14.000 --> 05:18.000]  But they really want to be able to open up the entire store and make it part of that block,
[05:18.000 --> 05:21.000]  almost like an open-air market.
[05:21.000 --> 05:27.000]  Interesting. And I can definitely say here in Philadelphia,
[05:27.000 --> 05:32.000]  I tend to walk by the, you know, it's just in a busy retail area,
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  so no surprise that I end up walking by the Apple Store a lot.
[05:35.000 --> 05:40.000]  And, you know, like most Apple Stores, almost always pretty crowded.
[05:40.000 --> 05:44.000]  And it's definitely not just people who are shopping for things.
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.000]  I mean, there are definitely people who just go in to hang out,
[05:47.000 --> 05:50.000]  check their email and stuff like that.
[05:50.000 --> 05:54.000]  Yeah, and they're taking that whole approach and they're applying it to everything.
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  So there's a giant screen now.
[05:56.000 --> 05:59.000]  And if people remember, there used to be a movie theater at the old Union Square store.
[05:59.000 --> 06:03.000]  But now they have this giant 6K display, and it looked seamless to me.
[06:03.000 --> 06:05.000]  It looked like it was actually one display,
[06:05.000 --> 06:07.000]  and I immediately just wanted to take it home, but they don't sell it.
[06:07.000 --> 06:10.000]  And that's right in the middle of what they call Forum now.
[06:10.000 --> 06:14.000]  And Forum has these little box and ball seats that you can sit on,
[06:14.000 --> 06:18.000]  and they can make it one big room where a developer or an expert can come and give a talk,
[06:18.000 --> 06:20.000]  but they can also split it up into smaller areas.
[06:20.000 --> 06:24.000]  So you can have several people doing smaller talks at the same time.
[06:24.000 --> 06:27.000]  And the screen can be used for presentations, but also just shows information.
[06:27.000 --> 06:32.000]  And all the iconography is exactly like iOS, and it uses San Francisco as a typeface.
[06:32.000 --> 06:35.000]  So it was built to be an Apple product.
[06:35.000 --> 06:38.000]  Like, what would an Apple, what would iOS look like running on a 6K display
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.000]  is exactly what you'd expect with this.
[06:41.000 --> 06:46.000]  Yeah, I think those big displays are part of the, I mean, in every, you know,
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  a lot of these stores have to fit the existing space.
[06:50.000 --> 06:53.000]  They can't just say, here's the dimensions that we want.
[06:53.000 --> 06:58.000]  It's, you know, we're in a historic building here, so, you know, here's what we have to work with.
[06:58.000 --> 07:02.000]  But those big displays are definitely part of the new store design.
[07:02.000 --> 07:05.000]  Yeah, and they took the Genius Bar, and they said, you know, Genius Bar,
[07:05.000 --> 07:07.000]  it's got some negative connotations.
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.000]  Like, it's loud, it's noisy, people are elbowing,
[07:09.000 --> 07:12.000]  everyone's fighting for their chance to get to the Genius Bartender,
[07:12.000 --> 07:14.000]  and it's not the experience they want to give anymore,
[07:14.000 --> 07:18.000]  especially now that a lot of the software and basic help and how-to stuff has moved online.
[07:18.000 --> 07:21.000]  So now they have the Genius Grove, which is right up front in the store,
[07:21.000 --> 07:24.000]  not in the back anymore, and it's part of that area where the forum is
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.000]  with a lot of these open tables and open seating
[07:27.000 --> 07:30.000]  and those trees that people might have seen at the Belgium store previously.
[07:30.000 --> 07:33.000]  And you can just go and sit there and get help with your Mac or iPhone or iPad
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.000]  for hardware issues or other things that they can't solve online
[07:36.000 --> 07:39.000]  and not feel sort of crowded around the little table anymore.
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.000]  Hmm. That's interesting. It's interesting that they would move that to the front.
[07:42.000 --> 07:45.000]  The whole thing was super interesting. They have a boardroom there,
[07:45.000 --> 07:48.000]  and I don't know, they said like some of these features will move to other stores,
[07:48.000 --> 07:51.000]  and some of them they've tried already, but there's something called boardroom,
[07:51.000 --> 07:55.000]  where Apple's approaching enterprise and big business with Oracle partnerships
[07:55.000 --> 07:59.000]  and IBM partnerships, but for smaller businesses, for entrepreneurs,
[07:59.000 --> 08:02.000]  for VCs, for sort of the Kickstarter stuff, they have boardroom now
[08:02.000 --> 08:05.000]  where people can go in and not only get help with that,
[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  but also network and make connections.
[08:07.000 --> 08:11.000]  And they were saying that part of San Francisco is so rich with that kind of culture
[08:11.000 --> 08:14.000]  that they wanted a nexus, almost like an Apple-centric nexus for them,
[08:14.000 --> 08:17.000]  and that became the boardroom area.
[08:17.000 --> 08:20.000]  The retail stuff was super interesting too because they have the Avenue now.
[08:20.000 --> 08:22.000]  So the Avenue, they used to have those accessories,
[08:22.000 --> 08:25.000]  but if anyone has seen pictures of the new Infinite Loop store
[08:25.000 --> 08:28.000]  or the new store in New York, and I think the one in Belgium too,
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.000]  they've got these panes.
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  Instead of just having cases, there's cases on shelves,
[08:33.000 --> 08:35.000]  and you see the individual cases.
[08:35.000 --> 08:38.000]  So it's an avenue, and you have almost like little boutiques called windows
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  where there's different sets of accessories like cases
[08:40.000 --> 08:42.000]  and photography equipment and music,
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.000]  and they have a new Apple job there called the Creative Pro,
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  and the Creative Pro's job is to help you.
[08:47.000 --> 08:50.000]  You're supposed to touch everything, try everything, sample everything,
[08:50.000 --> 08:52.000]  and if you need help, they'll show you the basics.
[08:52.000 --> 08:55.000]  If you don't know anything, the basics of photography or music,
[08:55.000 --> 08:58.000]  but they can also go up to and including lessons on Final Cut Pro or Logic Pro
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  if you want to take that next step up,
[09:00.000 --> 09:03.000]  and they really want to make that sort of your introduction to Apple experience,
[09:03.000 --> 09:05.000]  and it really is the whole back of the store.
[09:05.000 --> 09:08.000]  It's just one long run for that.
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.000]  So what do you think? Do you think it's an improvement?
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  It's just an evolution?
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.000]  It's super interesting, because the last thing I didn't mention
[09:15.000 --> 09:17.000]  is that they also have this garden, this neglected area.
[09:17.000 --> 09:20.000]  They've turned into a garden where it's 24-7 Wi-Fi with seating,
[09:20.000 --> 09:24.000]  and it can fit up to 200 people, and it's interesting as an experiment,
[09:24.000 --> 09:27.000]  and I like that Apple is not just doing that incremental thing,
[09:27.000 --> 09:29.000]  that they're willing to take risks with this,
[09:29.000 --> 09:32.000]  that, you know, Johnny Ivan and Angela Irons are passionate about this.
[09:32.000 --> 09:34.000]  It'll be interesting to see how people react to it.
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  Usually you go into an Apple store,
[09:36.000 --> 09:38.000]  and you see dozens of kids around the machine
[09:38.000 --> 09:40.000]  trying to use Facebook or something like that,
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.000]  but this really does seem like a place where people like us,
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  we're really good at handling Apple technology.
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.000]  We only go there if we break our screen or something.
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  We need a logic board to play something.
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  Something really serious happens, but for a lot of people,
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  I feel totally alienated going into a lot of stores.
[09:55.000 --> 09:58.000]  I go into a liquor store, and I've got to text you or somebody for advice.
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  I just have no idea what I'm doing, and I feel bad.
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.000]  I feel anxious and a little bit embarrassed and dumb,
[10:04.000 --> 10:06.000]  and for a lot of people, that's what technology is like,
[10:06.000 --> 10:09.000]  and if they can go to an Apple store and get greeted
[10:09.000 --> 10:12.000]  and get help and get shown things and learn things,
[10:12.000 --> 10:14.000]  and I think it de-stresses all that,
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.000]  and it shows that Apple really is playing the long game still.
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  They don't want to bring you in there and hustle you
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  and force you to buy a case just to get a quick sale.
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  They want to make that Apple brand super important to you
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  so that even if you don't need something now,
[10:24.000 --> 10:27.000]  if you're just curious, you'll think that Apple's just a great experience,
[10:27.000 --> 10:30.000]  and when you do want something, that's exactly where you're going to go.
[10:30.000 --> 10:34.000]  Yeah, I do think, you know, it's funny looking back
[10:34.000 --> 10:40.000]  because at this point, the Apple stores being ubiquitous,
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  I mean, they're pretty much everywhere,
[10:42.000 --> 10:47.000]  and being successful, it's been long enough that we just take it for granted
[10:47.000 --> 10:52.000]  that going back to when they first started it, it was widely panned,
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.000]  and there's a massive file of claim chowder in my bookmarks
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  of people who were predicting doom
[10:59.000 --> 11:01.000]  because every other computer company that had ever tried
[11:01.000 --> 11:04.000]  their own branded stores before failed miserably.
[11:04.000 --> 11:07.000]  I mean, Gateway isn't even a company anymore.
[11:07.000 --> 11:09.000]  No, yeah, totally.
[11:09.000 --> 11:14.000]  And it just gets to the heart of why Apple is not like other computer companies,
[11:14.000 --> 11:21.000]  and part of it is just as simple as the fact that they do hardware and software,
[11:21.000 --> 11:24.000]  which sounds like, well, come on, that's not that big a deal,
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.000]  but it's not necessarily because they do hardware and software.
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.000]  What makes Apple different is why they do hardware and software, right?
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  I would say that the fact that they do the hardware and software
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  is the result of, you know, it's the effect,
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  and that the cause is just the way that Apple approaches this stuff that's different,
[11:41.000 --> 11:45.000]  and their stores are emblematic of that.
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.000]  Absolutely. If you look at Apple, the consistent theme from the Apple II
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  all the way to something like an Apple Watch or an Apple TV
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  is the mainstreaming of computing technology,
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  democratization of access to ubiquitous computing,
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  and the Apple Store is like that.
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  It's a way to reach people, and it's a way to make people want to sort of get,
[12:04.000 --> 12:07.000]  make this, and you've called it this before, like this affordable luxury
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  where technology shouldn't be just kept to a small few people,
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  and it shouldn't be something that's off-putting or inaccessible
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  or something that makes you feel bad about yourself.
[12:15.000 --> 12:17.000]  It should be something that everybody can use to enhance their lives,
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.000]  and Apple, people will debate, is it a hardware company, software company?
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  It's really a product company.
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  Apple products because they want to give you a great experience,
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  and this is absolutely an extension of that.
[12:26.000 --> 12:31.000]  I do think there's, and it's pretty clear that the architectural evolution
[12:31.000 --> 12:36.000]  of the Apple Store has gotten a lot more humane, I would say,
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.000]  where the original design was sort of like being inside a,
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  probably at the time it was a power book.
[12:42.000 --> 12:48.000]  You know, it was sort of like aluminum walls, and it was, you know.
[12:48.000 --> 12:49.000]  Almost utilitarian.
[12:49.000 --> 12:54.000]  Yeah, it was a very, not quite like you're in a sci-fi movie,
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.000]  but futuristic and definitely forward-thinking and a little cold,
[12:57.000 --> 13:03.000]  a little clean, and, you know, utilitarian is a good way to put it.
[13:03.000 --> 13:08.000]  And the stores got warmer when they started going more towards wood
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  and getting away from the metal walls,
[13:10.000 --> 13:15.000]  and I know most or all of the original Apple Stores that had that first look,
[13:15.000 --> 13:19.000]  all of them, I think, have at one point or another been shut down
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.000]  to be renovated to be updated to the more humane look.
[13:23.000 --> 13:28.000]  But this new look, which is sort of like a 3.0, is downright organic.
[13:28.000 --> 13:31.000]  I mean, there are actual plants, you know, on the walls.
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  There's trees in the middle.
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.000]  Right, and if the stores are big enough, they even have trees.
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  And this one has a garden wall.
[13:37.000 --> 13:40.000]  The only thing that was curious to me is they don't have the glowing logo anymore
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  that you were so used to seeing on the stores.
[13:42.000 --> 13:45.000]  They actually have something that's like the embedded stainless steel logo
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.000]  that you'd see on a MacBook or an iPhone or an iPad,
[13:48.000 --> 13:51.000]  and it's big and it's space gray and it's right on the side of the building.
[13:51.000 --> 13:54.000]  So it's not on the front of the building? It's on the side?
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.000]  Well, I'm not sure what is actually the front because you have those two big doors.
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  You have the front and the back door, and those take up the entire wall.
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  They're 40-foot doors.
[14:01.000 --> 14:04.000]  So then in between those on the other side, you have the giant Apple logo.
[14:04.000 --> 14:11.000]  Somebody who's selling big pieces of glass is making a lot of money from Apple.
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  Yeah, especially considering campus too.
[14:13.000 --> 14:14.000]  Exactly.
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  It's higher at this point.
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  Oh, man.
[14:18.000 --> 14:24.000]  I guess my only worry with the Apple Store is that if I have to play devil's advocate,
[14:24.000 --> 14:30.000]  I worry that maybe they're getting a little unfocused.
[14:30.000 --> 14:33.000]  Shouldn't there be a focus to this?
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.000]  And I would say that originally the focus was very simple.
[14:37.000 --> 14:43.000]  It was to let people come in and see and play and touch Apple products because it's the best way.
[14:43.000 --> 14:48.000]  And I think this was a lot more important in the early parts of the last decade,
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.000]  let's say when people called them the iPod company,
[14:51.000 --> 14:58.000]  because people didn't know Apple products because they had relative to now so many,
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.000]  an order of magnitude fewer customers, maybe two orders of magnitude fewer customers.
[15:03.000 --> 15:09.000]  The thing that makes Apple products desirable are things that you really have to see them
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.000]  and use it yourself to see how nice they are.
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.000]  You can say that this iPod is nicer than other music players,
[15:17.000 --> 15:24.000]  but you really have to use it and see how it feels when you spin the click wheel
[15:24.000 --> 15:30.000]  or in the modern time to just load a web page and see how much better the trackpad is
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  than the Windows trackpad you might be used to, etc.
[15:33.000 --> 15:40.000]  You can't just say, hey, Macs have much nicer trackpads than the crappy Windows machine you're used to.
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.000]  You can say it, but seeing is believing.
[15:44.000 --> 15:45.000]  And that was the purpose of the stores.
[15:45.000 --> 15:48.000]  Let people see these things, make it easy to buy them,
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  and once you have them, make it easy to get help with them.
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  And that was it.
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.000]  And now I feel like by making it a community hub,
[15:55.000 --> 16:03.000]  I wonder if they're just, again, to play devil's advocate, is it worrisome that they're maybe losing focus?
[16:03.000 --> 16:05.000]  So I think that's absolutely valid.
[16:05.000 --> 16:09.000]  I'm wondering how much of the community focus is actually the sugar candy coating on this,
[16:09.000 --> 16:12.000]  because you sort of go through those three stages you mentioned
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.000]  where Apple stores became a place where you could go buy Apple products, and that was perfect timing.
[16:16.000 --> 16:19.000]  It was one of the many things that were the confluence that led to iPhone
[16:19.000 --> 16:22.000]  becoming the astronomical business that it was,
[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  and Apple made iPhone super available at the Apple stores.
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  But then there was this whole move towards the halo effect,
[16:26.000 --> 16:29.000]  where once you got an iPhone, that was sort of your gateway to Apple,
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  and then there was the back to my Mac event,
[16:31.000 --> 16:33.000]  and once you had an iPhone, you'd go to the Apple store,
[16:33.000 --> 16:35.000]  and maybe you'd get a Mac or you'd get an iPad.
[16:35.000 --> 16:38.000]  But now we're getting to a point where these products are so mature
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  that they have to start looking for extra markets,
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  and that there is Apple Watch and Apple TV,
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  and those sort of become satellites around the iPhone.
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.000]  But now there really is this move, especially with that new avenue set up,
[16:47.000 --> 16:51.000]  towards the things that now that iPhone is built out as a platform,
[16:51.000 --> 16:53.000]  the things that you can build out from the iPhone platform,
[16:53.000 --> 16:56.000]  and that is photography and music and things like cases,
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.000]  which are similar to watch bands for phones.
[16:58.000 --> 17:01.000]  And while the iPhone business might be maturing,
[17:01.000 --> 17:04.000]  it lets Apple build all these other small businesses
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  that aren't as valuable as the iPhone,
[17:06.000 --> 17:09.000]  but taken together might become very, very valuable for Apple.
[17:09.000 --> 17:12.000]  All right, and I can't move on from the store
[17:12.000 --> 17:18.000]  without mentioning the giant doors that easily could accommodate a car.
[17:18.000 --> 17:26.000]  When you look at that front showroom, can you imagine two cars on the floor?
[17:26.000 --> 17:27.000]  Is there room for that?
[17:27.000 --> 17:31.000]  Yeah, it's funny because I went from the Apple store,
[17:31.000 --> 17:34.000]  I went down to Santana Row later where they have a Tesla store,
[17:34.000 --> 17:37.000]  and the Tesla store looks very much like that front of that Apple store.
[17:37.000 --> 17:41.000]  Once that's open, they have room for two Teslas and the bottom chassis there,
[17:41.000 --> 17:44.000]  so three cars in essence for print.
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.000]  And absolutely, if you move those tables out of the way,
[17:47.000 --> 17:50.000]  you can easily see, especially if Apple goes for something small and smart car,
[17:50.000 --> 17:54.000]  you'll see a couple of those right in the front.
[17:54.000 --> 17:57.000]  All right, let me take a break and thank our first sponsor.
[17:57.000 --> 18:00.000]  It is our good friends at Casper.
[18:00.000 --> 18:08.000]  Casper sells obsessively engineered mattresses at shockingly fair prices.
[18:08.000 --> 18:11.000]  Go to casper.com slash the talk show
[18:11.000 --> 18:14.000]  and just use that code the talk show when you check out,
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.000]  and you will save 50 bucks on any mattress.
[18:16.000 --> 18:17.000]  So here's the deal.
[18:17.000 --> 18:20.000]  Casper created one perfect mattress,
[18:20.000 --> 18:23.000]  or at least one technology for the mattress.
[18:23.000 --> 18:27.000]  It is their own custom version of a foam mattress.
[18:27.000 --> 18:35.000]  It is sort of like memory foam, sort of like it's just the right balance.
[18:35.000 --> 18:36.000]  That's the thing.
[18:36.000 --> 18:39.000]  I always say that they're a lot like Apple,
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.000]  where instead of coming into a mattress store
[18:41.000 --> 18:44.000]  and picking between 10 different types of mattresses,
[18:44.000 --> 18:47.000]  seven different types of foam or spring or this,
[18:47.000 --> 18:50.000]  and you want this kind of sink, you want this kind of bounce, no.
[18:50.000 --> 18:51.000]  Forget it.
[18:51.000 --> 18:54.000]  Casper's engineers figured out the right type of foam
[18:54.000 --> 18:57.000]  that's the best for most people, and that's it.
[18:57.000 --> 18:59.000]  And then all you have to do is pick what size you want.
[18:59.000 --> 19:00.000]  That's it.
[19:00.000 --> 19:01.000]  You just pick what size.
[19:01.000 --> 19:02.000]  It could not be easier.
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.000]  And because they sell direct,
[19:04.000 --> 19:07.000]  they're one of these companies that just sells direct.
[19:07.000 --> 19:09.000]  That's why they're doing the podcast ads.
[19:09.000 --> 19:12.000]  That's why I'm talking to you about them, is there's no middleman.
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  That's where all of these savings come.
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  Casper makes these things.
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  They make them right here in the USA, by the way.
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  You go to the website.
[19:20.000 --> 19:21.000]  You pick what size you want.
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  You put the talk show code in.
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  You save 50 bucks, and boom, next thing you know,
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  this box shows up at your house, and you're like,
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  I cannot believe that there's an entire queen
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  or king-size mattress in this box.
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  You take it up to your bedroom.
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  You follow the little directions, very simple,
[19:36.000 --> 19:39.000]  of the right way to open a box, and then boom.
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  All of a sudden, you have a brand-new, very comfortable mattress
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  right there in your bedroom.
[19:44.000 --> 19:45.000]  Could not be easier.
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.000]  Here's how sure they are that you're going to like it.
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  They have a 100-night home trial.
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.000]  You go there. You buy it.
[19:51.000 --> 19:52.000]  Don't forget the code, the talk show.
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  You save 50 bucks, and if you don't love it,
[19:54.000 --> 19:58.000]  within 100 days, you just call them up or go to the website.
[19:58.000 --> 19:59.000]  They don't give you a hard time.
[19:59.000 --> 20:00.000]  They don't try to talk you out of it.
[20:00.000 --> 20:02.000]  They just say, okay, and then they schedule a time
[20:02.000 --> 20:04.000]  to come to your house and pick it up,
[20:04.000 --> 20:05.000]  and they give you a full refund.
[20:05.000 --> 20:08.000]  That's it, and it's like almost nobody does it
[20:08.000 --> 20:10.000]  because the mattress is so good.
[20:10.000 --> 20:11.000]  I've heard from a couple readers.
[20:11.000 --> 20:14.000]  Somebody wrote to me once and said that they did
[20:14.000 --> 20:16.000]  and that they were actually surprised at how, you know,
[20:16.000 --> 20:17.000]  they thought this was going to be a nightmare
[20:17.000 --> 20:18.000]  getting rid of this mattress
[20:18.000 --> 20:19.000]  because they actually didn't like it,
[20:19.000 --> 20:22.000]  and it was actually just as easy as I said.
[20:22.000 --> 20:23.000]  You call them up. They come.
[20:23.000 --> 20:25.000]  They get it, and you get all your money back.
[20:25.000 --> 20:29.000]  So go to casper.com slash the talk show and remember that,
[20:29.000 --> 20:33.000]  and next time you need a mattress, you'll save 50 bucks.
[20:33.000 --> 20:35.000]  Anything else on the Apple Store?
[20:35.000 --> 20:38.000]  No, I think it's going to be just interesting to see
[20:38.000 --> 20:41.000]  how rapidly and how many of these new five special features
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.000]  they roll out to other stores,
[20:43.000 --> 20:44.000]  how long that's going to take to happen.
[20:44.000 --> 20:47.000]  Yeah, you know, I bet fairly quickly,
[20:47.000 --> 20:49.000]  but it's, you know, it's certainly interesting,
[20:49.000 --> 20:51.000]  and it certainly does answer the question
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  of what's Angela Arndt been up to.
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  Yeah, she's been busy, and anyone who, like, again,
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  anyone who knows her on campus knows that she's been
[20:57.000 --> 20:59.000]  super engaged and super busy since she took over.
[20:59.000 --> 21:02.000]  Just even the transition from, prior to Angela Arndt's
[21:02.000 --> 21:05.000]  online and retail were separate operations,
[21:05.000 --> 21:06.000]  and she's been unifying those,
[21:06.000 --> 21:09.000]  and they did that giant online store makeover
[21:09.000 --> 21:11.000]  at the end of last year, which took them right from,
[21:11.000 --> 21:13.000]  that stuff was terribly outdated technology,
[21:13.000 --> 21:16.000]  and they went, like, whether you like it or hate it,
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  you know, you can't browse anymore,
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  but technologically speaking, the new Apple Store,
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.000]  they flipped a switch, and it appeared one day,
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  which is a remarkable achievement.
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.000]  Yeah, and you know, it's got to be a stressful job,
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  Angela Arndt, because, and I, you know,
[21:30.000 --> 21:33.000]  famously Apple doesn't really run by profit and loss centers,
[21:33.000 --> 21:36.000]  you know, there's no, you know, target for profit
[21:36.000 --> 21:39.000]  from the iPods and the target for profit from the Macs,
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  and I mean, I'm sure they have internal goals,
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  but they don't run, like, a division like that,
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  but retail, by definition, I mean, at the end of the day,
[21:45.000 --> 21:48.000]  you know, you, you know, there's these fixed costs,
[21:48.000 --> 21:51.000]  like the lease of the building, and all of the salaries
[21:51.000 --> 21:54.000]  for all of the employees, and then there's how much money
[21:54.000 --> 21:57.000]  you made by selling products, and it's, you know,
[21:57.000 --> 22:00.000]  if there is, you know, like, a decline in that,
[22:00.000 --> 22:03.000]  it's going to, you know, be noticeable.
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  Yeah, and Apple, again, famously doesn't have presidents,
[22:05.000 --> 22:08.000]  but if you look at the size of Apple Store business,
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  and it's similar to iTunes, where they,
[22:10.000 --> 22:13.000]  I mean, they need marketing, they need all these divisions
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  to make stuff for them, it's much more than a branch
[22:15.000 --> 22:18.000]  like engineering, or a branch like Silicon Technologies
[22:18.000 --> 22:19.000]  would need.
[22:19.000 --> 22:21.000]  Yeah, it's, you know, it's an incredible operation,
[22:21.000 --> 22:24.000]  really is, I wonder how many stores they have now.
[22:24.000 --> 22:27.000]  I forget the number, but it was the anniversary,
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  I think, the 15th or something anniversary yesterday
[22:29.000 --> 22:30.000]  when they timed this.
[22:30.000 --> 22:31.000]  Yeah.
[22:31.000 --> 22:36.000]  So, from one store to another, the App Store,
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.000]  and in the news lately, developers, something,
[22:40.000 --> 22:43.000]  they flipped some sort of switch within the last two weeks
[22:43.000 --> 22:47.000]  or so, and review times at the App Store haven't just
[22:47.000 --> 22:50.000]  gotten better, it's like, it's like overnight,
[22:50.000 --> 22:53.000]  it went from a roughly one-week review process,
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.000]  like here's version 1.2 of my app, I'm submitting it
[22:56.000 --> 22:57.000]  to the App Store.
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.000]  For years, I mean, the entire life of the App Store,
[23:00.000 --> 23:04.000]  you know, going back to 2008, you could more or less
[23:04.000 --> 23:08.000]  expect about a week before your app, if it goes through
[23:08.000 --> 23:12.000]  and everything is okay, about a week before it is,
[23:12.000 --> 23:15.000]  you get the email that says, okay, you know,
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  it's ready to go, just hit this button,
[23:17.000 --> 23:18.000]  and it'll be live in the store.
[23:18.000 --> 23:22.000]  And now it's one day, and at times, it's within a day.
[23:22.000 --> 23:25.000]  There's a story, Cable Sasser posted a tweet
[23:25.000 --> 23:27.000]  that one of the people at Panic published,
[23:27.000 --> 23:30.000]  not a Panic app, but a private app, you know,
[23:30.000 --> 23:33.000]  a personal app, at 10.30 in the morning, submitted it,
[23:33.000 --> 23:36.000]  got a notice at 3.30 in the afternoon that there was
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  a crasher, and it was actually a legitimate crasher,
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  so it was like, hey, thanks for finding this.
[23:40.000 --> 23:44.000]  At 5.30 or so, submitted a fixed version,
[23:44.000 --> 23:47.000]  and by like 9 o'clock at night, it was ready to go.
[23:47.000 --> 23:49.000]  8.30 at night, it was ready to go.
[23:49.000 --> 23:53.000]  So within a day, they submitted, a guy submitted an app,
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  they found a crasher, resubmitted a fixed version,
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  and published it to the store.
[23:57.000 --> 23:59.000]  So something's going on.
[23:59.000 --> 24:01.000]  Yeah, I mean, it's super interesting to me,
[24:01.000 --> 24:03.000]  because immediately, everyone's like, well, Phil Schiller,
[24:03.000 --> 24:05.000]  Phil Schiller, but, you know, Phil Schiller's
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  been in charge of app reviews since the beginning.
[24:07.000 --> 24:09.000]  That's always been part of his organization,
[24:09.000 --> 24:12.000]  the way that evangelism is, and the WWDR is.
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.000]  That's always been a Phil Schiller thing.
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.000]  So I just wonder that now that Phil Schiller
[24:16.000 --> 24:17.000]  has total control over the app store,
[24:17.000 --> 24:20.000]  that there's no more, you know, what can we put on Eddie?
[24:20.000 --> 24:21.000]  What can we put on Phil?
[24:21.000 --> 24:23.000]  Is anybody really looking at this?
[24:23.000 --> 24:24.000]  We need this fixed, Phil.
[24:24.000 --> 24:25.000]  You're going in there to fix it.
[24:25.000 --> 24:26.000]  It has to be fixed.
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  And that prompts a lot of action.
[24:28.000 --> 24:29.000]  I guess.
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  Is that what you think is going on?
[24:31.000 --> 24:32.000]  I mean.
[24:32.000 --> 24:33.000]  I think there's a couple of things.
[24:33.000 --> 24:36.000]  Like one is, you know, I'm not a developer,
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  but we've had apps, just for the company I work with,
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  has had apps in the app store for a very long time.
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  And usually what I would see, because I'm on the email chain,
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  is the app gets submitted, and then you don't hear anything
[24:44.000 --> 24:45.000]  for about a week.
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  And then at the weak point, it says your app is now in review.
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  And then usually, very quickly after that,
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  it's either approved or rejected.
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  So the actual review process was always very, very quick.
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  It was just a part getting your app into that review process
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.000]  that seemed to take a long time.
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.000]  And then when the Google Play Store famously switched to reviews,
[25:01.000 --> 25:03.000]  that gap was much less.
[25:03.000 --> 25:04.000]  Like they were doing something,
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  maybe not to the extent that Apple was doing it,
[25:06.000 --> 25:07.000]  but they didn't have that long gap
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.000]  before your app would go into review.
[25:09.000 --> 25:12.000]  And that was really what seemed to be killer for people.
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  And now that gap is gone.
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  And my understanding is, I forget how long it was,
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  maybe three or four weeks ago,
[25:18.000 --> 25:21.000]  there was just a major reorg in that organization.
[25:21.000 --> 25:26.000]  And they changed some things that I think needed to be changed.
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  I think everybody involved knew that they needed to be changed.
[25:28.000 --> 25:30.000]  I'm talking mostly like, I don't want to name names here,
[25:30.000 --> 25:33.000]  but people probably know who was involved in that organization
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  because they did get attention years ago.
[25:35.000 --> 25:38.000]  That got moved, and those people are no longer there.
[25:38.000 --> 25:41.000]  And it seems like that was the fix that needed to be made,
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  at least the high-level fix that needed to be made
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  to make this process on track.
[25:45.000 --> 25:50.000]  Yeah, I wonder if the, I think it was in January
[25:50.000 --> 25:52.000]  where they announced, or maybe it was December.
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  Yeah, it looks like it was back in December.
[25:54.000 --> 25:55.000]  So it was at the end of the year,
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.000]  and Apple made an announcement where,
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  did they promote somebody?
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.000]  I think somebody got promoted to be a senior vice president.
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.000]  What's his name? The chip guy.
[26:08.000 --> 26:09.000]  Oh, Johnny Srouji.
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.000]  Yeah, Johnny Srouji got promoted to senior vice president.
[26:14.000 --> 26:20.000]  And they put the app store, which used to be under Eddy Cue.
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  They moved it to Phil Schiller's group.
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.000]  And I can't help but think it's not,
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  I don't even think it's like a Phil versus anything.
[26:28.000 --> 26:32.000]  I think it's sort of a fell through the cracks thing
[26:32.000 --> 26:35.000]  because, like you said,
[26:35.000 --> 26:39.000]  app review was always part of developer relations,
[26:39.000 --> 26:43.000]  and developer relations has been under Phil Schiller
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  going back to the 90s.
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.000]  I mean, as long as Schiller's been there,
[26:47.000 --> 26:50.000]  I think Schiller's been in charge of, you know,
[26:50.000 --> 26:51.000]  not that he runs it.
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  You know, he's obviously got a lot of responsibilities,
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  but ultimately whoever's in charge of developer relations
[26:55.000 --> 26:58.000]  is a direct report to Phil Schiller.
[26:58.000 --> 27:02.000]  And I can't help but think that having the app store
[27:02.000 --> 27:05.000]  as everything else related to the app store,
[27:05.000 --> 27:09.000]  being under Eddy's group and review under Phil's group,
[27:09.000 --> 27:14.000]  it just creates a crack that I think the suboptimal,
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.000]  you know, week-long process, which was obviously,
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.000]  you know, the app store is a huge success for Apple.
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  Let's just look at this from Apple's perspective.
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.000]  And I'm not trying to make excuses for it.
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  I'm just saying it's objectively,
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.000]  there's no way you could argue that the app store,
[27:30.000 --> 27:33.000]  especially on iOS, is a tremendous success.
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.000]  I mean, it's, in my opinion, literally responsible
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.000]  for the fact that app is now a word that everybody knows.
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  It is a common, it's, you know,
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  it's just a word that everybody knows.
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  That really wasn't the case before the iPhone.
[27:46.000 --> 27:49.000]  People didn't talk about apps.
[27:49.000 --> 27:52.000]  At least outside, you know, our sphere.
[27:52.000 --> 27:55.000]  And here, it's a huge success,
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  so I think a lot of the complaints that have come in,
[27:57.000 --> 27:58.000]  it's like, come on, what do you complain about?
[27:58.000 --> 27:59.000]  This thing is awesome.
[27:59.000 --> 28:03.000]  Whereas, I think putting it all under fill
[28:03.000 --> 28:06.000]  eliminates that crack, and it's a lot easier to say,
[28:06.000 --> 28:09.000]  look, there's no buck, we can't pass the buck here.
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  We're the group in charge of this.
[28:11.000 --> 28:12.000]  This isn't great.
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  A week-long review process is, you know,
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  Apple can do better than that.
[28:16.000 --> 28:17.000]  We can't, you know, we, Apple,
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  can't say we don't have the resources to do better than this.
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  We have billions of dollars.
[28:21.000 --> 28:24.000]  We could and should do better.
[28:24.000 --> 28:25.000]  Absolutely.
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  I mean, so around that time, there was a rework
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  in the marketing organization as well,
[28:29.000 --> 28:30.000]  and, you know, Phil Schiller took full responsibility
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  for the App Store, but at the same time,
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.000]  you know, someone like Greg Joswiak,
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.000]  who's also phenomenal,
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  took on full product marketing responsibilities
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  across the range of Apple products,
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  not just iOS devices anymore.
[28:40.000 --> 28:41.000]  And I think that allowed a lot of them
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  to sort of focus down on these issues
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  and avoid anything slipping through the cracks.
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.000]  But also, as Apple scales, Phil Schiller is phenomenal.
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  EdiQ is phenomenal.
[28:50.000 --> 28:51.000]  Craig Vedericki is phenomenal.
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  But the amount of product that they have to ship now
[28:53.000 --> 28:54.000]  is exponentially bigger
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  than what they had to ship several years ago,
[28:56.000 --> 28:57.000]  and they're still human beings,
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.000]  and they can't look at everything all the time.
[29:00.000 --> 29:03.000]  So having people who have that more focused responsibility,
[29:03.000 --> 29:05.000]  I think, is really great.
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.000]  Like, for a long time, all I wanted from Apple
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.000]  was a front-facing vice president of App Store,
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.000]  and with Phil Schiller, you know,
[29:11.000 --> 29:13.000]  it might even be better than that world,
[29:13.000 --> 29:14.000]  because Phil is...
[29:14.000 --> 29:15.000]  It's funny, because, like,
[29:15.000 --> 29:16.000]  you still have certain personalities
[29:16.000 --> 29:17.000]  from the Apple groups.
[29:17.000 --> 29:18.000]  Like, it always seems like EdiQ's group
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  is slightly, you know, louder shirts
[29:20.000 --> 29:22.000]  and a little looser-going,
[29:22.000 --> 29:24.000]  and Phil Schiller is, like, very, very focused
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  and really cares about the user experience,
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  and you all have these distinct personalities,
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.000]  but giving him the App Store and letting him run it,
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  I think regardless of whether the organization
[29:32.000 --> 29:33.000]  has always been his,
[29:33.000 --> 29:35.000]  it lets him focus down on that
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  and say, if I'm waking up today
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  and I want to make App Store a phenomenal product,
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.000]  and not just for developers, but for users,
[29:41.000 --> 29:42.000]  because if there's a bug in an app,
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.000]  I don't want that bug for a week.
[29:44.000 --> 29:45.000]  I want that bug fixed immediately,
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  and me having to wait for a developer to get a review,
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.000]  I feel bad for the developer, but I want my bug fixed,
[29:50.000 --> 29:53.000]  and this fixes a really big-facing customer issue.
[29:53.000 --> 29:54.000]  What do you think...
[29:54.000 --> 29:57.000]  So what do you think they're doing differently?
[29:57.000 --> 29:58.000]  I think... Part of it, I think,
[29:58.000 --> 29:59.000]  is just they made personnel changes
[29:59.000 --> 30:01.000]  that they really should have made years ago.
[30:01.000 --> 30:02.000]  I mean, like, when you'd hear
[30:02.000 --> 30:03.000]  what was going on behind some of this,
[30:03.000 --> 30:05.000]  like, we see this stuff on the outside,
[30:05.000 --> 30:07.000]  but people inside Apple feel this stuff,
[30:07.000 --> 30:08.000]  feel the same kind of pain we do,
[30:08.000 --> 30:10.000]  and they see decisions that don't make any sense
[30:10.000 --> 30:12.000]  and reversals and things like that,
[30:12.000 --> 30:13.000]  and just it kept coming back
[30:13.000 --> 30:15.000]  to sort of the same group of people,
[30:15.000 --> 30:18.000]  and reorging that seems to have taken care of that.
[30:18.000 --> 30:20.000]  So, like, I don't know if there is technical issues
[30:20.000 --> 30:21.000]  that they change, too,
[30:21.000 --> 30:23.000]  but it just seems like this really coincided
[30:23.000 --> 30:25.000]  with reorganizing App Review.
[30:25.000 --> 30:26.000]  It has to be...
[30:26.000 --> 30:28.000]  There has to be procedural differences, though.
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.000]  There has to be something that they're doing procedurally
[30:31.000 --> 30:33.000]  that is different than what they were doing before,
[30:33.000 --> 30:35.000]  because it's just...
[30:35.000 --> 30:39.000]  Even just throwing more reviewers at it,
[30:39.000 --> 30:40.000]  if it was a backlog,
[30:40.000 --> 30:44.000]  I don't think would result in same-day submissions.
[30:44.000 --> 30:47.000]  I know I just was listening to ATP this morning,
[30:47.000 --> 30:49.000]  and I know Marco had the exact same experience
[30:49.000 --> 30:54.000]  where he had a same-day approval of an Overcast update,
[30:54.000 --> 30:55.000]  which it just...
[30:55.000 --> 30:59.000]  I mean, same day, it's just not how the App Store looks.
[30:59.000 --> 31:01.000]  So something is different procedurally.
[31:01.000 --> 31:03.000]  I think that with this reorg,
[31:03.000 --> 31:05.000]  the reorg put people in place
[31:05.000 --> 31:08.000]  who were willing to institute the procedural changes
[31:08.000 --> 31:09.000]  that we're seeing,
[31:09.000 --> 31:10.000]  and I think one of them,
[31:10.000 --> 31:13.000]  it has to be something where they've enabled reviewers
[31:13.000 --> 31:16.000]  to sort of look at the history of a developer.
[31:16.000 --> 31:17.000]  I'm just guessing.
[31:17.000 --> 31:18.000]  It's just a guess,
[31:18.000 --> 31:19.000]  but let's say,
[31:19.000 --> 31:20.000]  okay, here's an app.
[31:20.000 --> 31:23.000]  It's from Marco Arment,
[31:23.000 --> 31:27.000]  and here's the history of submissions that he's made.
[31:27.000 --> 31:28.000]  It's, oh, look at how many...
[31:28.000 --> 31:30.000]  You know, this is a very popular app,
[31:30.000 --> 31:33.000]  and here's how many updates he has submitted.
[31:33.000 --> 31:38.000]  He's never abused the system by...
[31:38.000 --> 31:39.000]  I can't help but think that
[31:39.000 --> 31:42.000]  if you started submitting builds daily,
[31:42.000 --> 31:43.000]  that if you just...
[31:43.000 --> 31:44.000]  Every single...
[31:44.000 --> 31:47.000]  If you started submitting the equivalent of nightly builds,
[31:47.000 --> 31:49.000]  you're not going to get same-day approval.
[31:49.000 --> 31:50.000]  I think that they're going to,
[31:50.000 --> 31:51.000]  I would guess,
[31:51.000 --> 31:53.000]  look at the history and put the brakes on that
[31:53.000 --> 31:55.000]  and say no.
[31:55.000 --> 31:57.000]  But if your history is,
[31:57.000 --> 31:59.000]  wow, you've never been a problem.
[31:59.000 --> 32:02.000]  This is obviously a legitimate app.
[32:02.000 --> 32:05.000]  Here, let's just make sure that there are no crashers.
[32:05.000 --> 32:07.000]  Let's open it up and go through
[32:07.000 --> 32:08.000]  and see that everything works.
[32:08.000 --> 32:09.000]  Okay, there you go.
[32:09.000 --> 32:10.000]  You're through.
[32:10.000 --> 32:13.000]  Yeah, I think it's exactly that.
[32:13.000 --> 32:15.000]  I think it's putting together a smart system,
[32:15.000 --> 32:17.000]  and what I liked about Cable's tweet, too,
[32:17.000 --> 32:18.000]  is that it said they could cut the crash,
[32:18.000 --> 32:19.000]  the crash was fixed,
[32:19.000 --> 32:20.000]  then the app went out.
[32:20.000 --> 32:22.000]  So they're not just suddenly opening the gates
[32:22.000 --> 32:23.000]  and saying, fine, just get rid of the backlog,
[32:23.000 --> 32:24.000]  push all apps out.
[32:24.000 --> 32:25.000]  They're running those instruments,
[32:25.000 --> 32:26.000]  and they're running those tests,
[32:26.000 --> 32:28.000]  and they're finding those things.
[32:28.000 --> 32:29.000]  And then if that flags it,
[32:29.000 --> 32:30.000]  maybe they're paying better attention to it
[32:30.000 --> 32:31.000]  and say, we caught this bug.
[32:31.000 --> 32:32.000]  Oh, the guy's resubmitted it.
[32:32.000 --> 32:33.000]  Let's go.
[32:33.000 --> 32:34.000]  Nothing else was wrong with it.
[32:34.000 --> 32:36.000]  And maybe just they got rid of people
[32:36.000 --> 32:39.000]  whose opinions were not congruent
[32:39.000 --> 32:40.000]  or weren't easy to work with
[32:40.000 --> 32:42.000]  or were holding back other people.
[32:42.000 --> 32:43.000]  Because it really,
[32:43.000 --> 32:44.000]  if you think about it linearly,
[32:44.000 --> 32:45.000]  it should not be app review
[32:45.000 --> 32:46.000]  or making choices about what is
[32:46.000 --> 32:48.000]  and what isn't proper user experience.
[32:48.000 --> 32:50.000]  It's whole realms of other people at Apple
[32:50.000 --> 32:51.000]  much better positioned to do that
[32:51.000 --> 32:53.000]  before an app ever hits review.
[32:53.000 --> 32:55.000]  So getting all that out of the way
[32:55.000 --> 32:56.000]  and putting in that system
[32:56.000 --> 32:57.000]  and then just applying it
[32:57.000 --> 32:59.000]  I think is the key to what we're seeing now.
[32:59.000 --> 33:00.000]  Yeah, I think so.
[33:00.000 --> 33:02.000]  But it's very, very good news.
[33:02.000 --> 33:05.000]  And it's one of those rare things
[33:05.000 --> 33:09.000]  that there is no downside to this whatsoever.
[33:09.000 --> 33:10.000]  There is no,
[33:10.000 --> 33:12.000]  so whatever they're doing at Apple,
[33:12.000 --> 33:13.000]  whoever, if you're listening
[33:13.000 --> 33:16.000]  and you work in developer relations,
[33:16.000 --> 33:19.000]  the entire world of third-party developers
[33:19.000 --> 33:21.000]  says thank you.
[33:21.000 --> 33:22.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[33:22.000 --> 33:23.000]  And to go back to your point,
[33:23.000 --> 33:26.000]  the App Store is a phenomenal business for Apple.
[33:26.000 --> 33:28.000]  And developers do have pain points.
[33:28.000 --> 33:29.000]  And it's really hard,
[33:29.000 --> 33:30.000]  it's not hard,
[33:30.000 --> 33:31.000]  but it's hard emotionally to sort out
[33:31.000 --> 33:33.000]  because a lot of our friends are developers.
[33:33.000 --> 33:35.000]  And you'll go to WWDC
[33:35.000 --> 33:36.000]  and see the App Store labs
[33:36.000 --> 33:37.000]  and a developer will go in there
[33:37.000 --> 33:38.000]  and say, I made a great app.
[33:38.000 --> 33:39.000]  Are you going to feature it?
[33:39.000 --> 33:41.000]  And they'll say, what's your marketing plan?
[33:41.000 --> 33:42.000]  And developers say, I don't need one.
[33:42.000 --> 33:43.000]  I'm going to feature it, right?
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.000]  And they're like, well, even if we do feature it,
[33:45.000 --> 33:47.000]  that's one week out of 51.
[33:47.000 --> 33:49.000]  What are you doing for the other 51 weeks?
[33:49.000 --> 33:50.000]  And that's the kind of thing
[33:50.000 --> 33:51.000]  that App Store can't really fix.
[33:51.000 --> 33:52.000]  They'll never be able to,
[33:52.000 --> 33:53.000]  no matter how good your app is,
[33:53.000 --> 33:55.000]  they'll never be able to artificially
[33:55.000 --> 33:56.000]  make it a hit app,
[33:56.000 --> 33:58.000]  especially in the climate we are in now.
[33:58.000 --> 34:00.000]  But they can fix a lot of things.
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  Search is a solved problem.
[34:02.000 --> 34:03.000]  I type in tweetbot.
[34:03.000 --> 34:04.000]  I should get tweetbot.
[34:04.000 --> 34:06.000]  There should be no discussion about that anymore.
[34:06.000 --> 34:07.000]  Google can handle that.
[34:07.000 --> 34:10.000]  I think AltaVista handled that.
[34:10.000 --> 34:11.000]  But it's still something that's not workable.
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  On the App Store.
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  And I understand the technical reasons.
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  I understand the infrastructure reasons.
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.000]  But why isn't there a metadata layer
[34:21.000 --> 34:23.000]  that just intermediates that stuff
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  and then goes to the old school database system,
[34:25.000 --> 34:27.000]  pulls the likely results and gives me that?
[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  Search widening, sloppy search, nearest neighbor.
[34:29.000 --> 34:32.000]  All these things, these can help developers.
[34:32.000 --> 34:33.000]  If I search for Twitter,
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.000]  I should get relevant results,
[34:35.000 --> 34:36.000]  not just linear,
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  like, oh, this has Twitter in the name.
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.000]  I want tweetbot in that result.
[34:40.000 --> 34:41.000]  And that's sort of a thing, I think,
[34:41.000 --> 34:43.000]  that affects customers and affects developers.
[34:43.000 --> 34:46.000]  And it's something that Apple absolutely knows about that,
[34:46.000 --> 34:47.000]  and they feel that pain.
[34:47.000 --> 34:49.000]  But those are sort of things that I really hope
[34:49.000 --> 34:51.000]  that they figure out how to fix sooner rather than later.
[34:51.000 --> 34:53.000]  Yeah, it's got to be.
[34:53.000 --> 34:54.000]  I hope so.
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  This is a sign that makes me think
[34:56.000 --> 34:59.000]  that I would bet on them fixing App Store search
[34:59.000 --> 35:01.000]  in the near future,
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  just because it seems like somebody's paying attention
[35:03.000 --> 35:07.000]  to these little long-standing issues.
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.000]  And that's another one that's super long-standing.
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  And I've made the exact same argument.
[35:11.000 --> 35:15.000]  I don't care how hard a technical problem it is.
[35:15.000 --> 35:18.000]  Apple cannot cry poor, right?
[35:18.000 --> 35:19.000]  Yes.
[35:19.000 --> 35:22.000]  And it is, you know, however hard it is,
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  it's obviously been solved.
[35:24.000 --> 35:28.000]  And so the standard, the bar is Google, right?
[35:28.000 --> 35:32.000]  And you should not be able to get better search results
[35:32.000 --> 35:35.000]  by typing in a Google box,
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.000]  like your example, tweetbot iOS.
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  You should not, iOS app,
[35:40.000 --> 35:44.000]  you should not be more likely to be led to tweetbot
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  than if you type tweetbot in the App Store.
[35:46.000 --> 35:47.000]  It's got to be that good.
[35:47.000 --> 35:50.000]  And it can't be as hard as web search
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  because web search is searching everything.
[35:52.000 --> 35:53.000]  You're only searching,
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.000]  I don't care how many million apps you have,
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  you're only searching your own apps.
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  I just feel like Apple got burned
[35:59.000 --> 36:02.000]  by whatever original algorithm they used for search
[36:02.000 --> 36:06.000]  where they trusted the metadata from developers
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  and opened the door to being scammed.
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.000]  That's, I mean, it's a huge part of the problem
[36:10.000 --> 36:11.000]  with the search results
[36:11.000 --> 36:14.000]  is that you get search results that are unrelated
[36:14.000 --> 36:18.000]  and then if you actually, like, look at the metadata,
[36:18.000 --> 36:21.000]  it's that they've put, like, in their list of keywords
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  that, you know, we want to be searched by,
[36:23.000 --> 36:24.000]  they put competing app names in,
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.000]  which is supposed to be against the rules,
[36:26.000 --> 36:28.000]  but it obviously doesn't get flagged.
[36:28.000 --> 36:31.000]  Yeah, I mean, to go back to your point a minute ago,
[36:31.000 --> 36:33.000]  I believe it's the customer's job
[36:33.000 --> 36:34.000]  to protect me even from myself.
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  So I really, I'm very hesitant
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.000]  to ever blame a user for something,
[36:38.000 --> 36:39.000]  and if I'm doing something wrong,
[36:39.000 --> 36:40.000]  that's fine, I'm doing it wrong,
[36:40.000 --> 36:42.000]  but it's still, if I'm using a company like Apple,
[36:42.000 --> 36:43.000]  I want them to do everything possible
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.000]  to stop me from making mistakes.
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.000]  And I don't even need keywords.
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  Like, that's part of the problem that's bewildering to me
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  is that you just, and I hate saying this
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  because it's so easy to say how you can fix these things,
[36:53.000 --> 36:56.000]  but I'm just talking about, I type in tweetbot without,
[36:56.000 --> 36:58.000]  and I miss the e because I'm human
[36:58.000 --> 36:59.000]  and I make a spelling mistake,
[36:59.000 --> 37:00.000]  and that doesn't result,
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  that doesn't rely on keywords at all.
[37:02.000 --> 37:03.000]  That's just you have a database of things
[37:03.000 --> 37:06.000]  and you know how to do nearest neighbor and search widening
[37:06.000 --> 37:09.000]  and basic things that search has been doing for a decade,
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  and you know what the most popular result is
[37:11.000 --> 37:13.000]  that's close to that one,
[37:13.000 --> 37:14.000]  and you provide me with that result
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  because that's what I want,
[37:16.000 --> 37:19.000]  and you kind of do that extra work to give me what I want.
[37:19.000 --> 37:22.000]  And it sort of feels like iTunes,
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.000]  which is the overarching infrastructure,
[37:24.000 --> 37:25.000]  all of this was built,
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  the App Store is built on the iTunes Store,
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.000]  which was originally designed to handle music.
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  All of this to me is almost like Apple's version
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.000]  of Windows XP where you have just a legacy product
[37:35.000 --> 37:38.000]  that needs to serve hundreds of millions of people
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.000]  with an incredibly diverse range of use cases.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  Like Jim Dalrymple wants 10 versions
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.000]  of every Ozzy Osbourne song to play exactly the one he wants
[37:47.000 --> 37:48.000]  whenever he wants it.
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  Well, I just want Siri to say,
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  play me this smooth criminal cover by Glee
[37:52.000 --> 37:53.000]  and it just does it,
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  and I have zero music in my library.
[37:55.000 --> 37:58.000]  And then there's someone who just bought an iPod Nano
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  at Best Buy and wants to sync it on their Windows PC
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  using iTunes over a cable.
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  And you also, on top of that,
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  you have billions of dollars of transactions
[38:06.000 --> 38:07.000]  moving through it,
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  and the person at Virgin Music,
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.000]  who knows how to use the crazy backend of iTunes
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  the way a Bloomberg terminal person
[38:14.000 --> 38:15.000]  knows how to use Bloomberg,
[38:15.000 --> 38:16.000]  and they just have to upload
[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  their entire music catalog for that week,
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.000]  and they wouldn't want anything to change
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  because they know how to do it even if it is horrible.
[38:22.000 --> 38:23.000]  And balancing all of that,
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  it's super easy on the internet to say,
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  just fix iTunes and just fix this.
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  I would not want that job.
[38:29.000 --> 38:30.000]  It sounds like, again,
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  like another one of those impossible jobs to me,
[38:32.000 --> 38:33.000]  but it is one of those jobs
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  that Apple has to figure out and fix
[38:35.000 --> 38:36.000]  because it's not getting any better.
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  Yeah.
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.000]  You know, it's just the fact of human nature.
[38:42.000 --> 38:46.000]  We're a terrible, dishonest species collectively.
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  You can't trust metadata.
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.000]  I mean, it sounds laughable,
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  but in the old days, in the 90s,
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  there was a time where search engines,
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  you'd put the meta tag in your HTML
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  and it would be like meta,
[38:59.000 --> 39:00.000]  and here you're supposed to list
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  like a handful of keywords that are like,
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  what is this page about?
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  And search engines would take those
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  and actually like trust them.
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  And so as soon as people figured out
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  that the search engines actually trust them,
[39:12.000 --> 39:13.000]  they would just start loading it up
[39:13.000 --> 39:18.000]  with anything and everything to get SEO.
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  It was keyword stuffing.
[39:20.000 --> 39:21.000]  It's ridiculous.
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  And of course, anything that can be abused
[39:23.000 --> 39:24.000]  is going to be abused,
[39:24.000 --> 39:27.000]  and unfortunately, the App Store can be abused,
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  and it is.
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  You see it anytime you type like a popular app name
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  and all these unrelated apps show up,
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.000]  and it's like, why the hell is that listed?
[39:36.000 --> 39:39.000]  Yeah, which is what Google solved for.
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  They originally had link authority,
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  and now I think that they're judging in social shares
[39:43.000 --> 39:44.000]  and other things like that.
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  You try to determine the authority of the result
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  and give people the results that are more widely respected,
[39:48.000 --> 39:52.000]  not just the ones that have data that you're looking for.
[39:52.000 --> 39:55.000]  Right, like it's the actual actions of users
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  that Google trusts,
[39:57.000 --> 40:00.000]  including things like being able to see like,
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  okay, you searched for X, Y, and Z,
[40:02.000 --> 40:05.000]  and we made this the second result,
[40:05.000 --> 40:06.000]  but you clicked it.
[40:06.000 --> 40:07.000]  That's the one you clicked.
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  And then I searched for X, Y, and Z,
[40:09.000 --> 40:10.000]  and it's the second result,
[40:10.000 --> 40:11.000]  but it's the one I clicked
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  because I realized it's the one I want.
[40:13.000 --> 40:14.000]  And then they're like,
[40:14.000 --> 40:15.000]  well, that must be a good result for X, Y, and Z.
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  Maybe we should make that the top result for X, Y, and Z
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  because all these people are clicking, you know.
[40:19.000 --> 40:20.000]  They do things like that.
[40:20.000 --> 40:21.000]  That can't be cheated.
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  I guess you could try to cheat it by having,
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  you know, bots click them or whatever,
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  but Google, you know, fights against it.
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  Anyway, it needs to be,
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  the App Store needs to be as good as Google Search, period.
[40:31.000 --> 40:32.000]  Yes.
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  For, just for apps, right?
[40:34.000 --> 40:37.000]  Yeah, and again, but it's, again,
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  like I don't know how often you search for email,
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  but I was trying to search for email this morning
[40:41.000 --> 40:42.000]  just to find something I knew was there,
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  and it was inside the email app.
[40:44.000 --> 40:45.000]  It was just a nightmare.
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  But if you go to Spotlight, it works fine.
[40:47.000 --> 40:50.000]  So whatever they're doing,
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  there just has to be a better way of doing it.
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  And I know they walked this back.
[40:54.000 --> 40:55.000]  They were going to have this process
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  because they're super concerned about privacy
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  where they would surface apps online for you
[40:59.000 --> 41:00.000]  if you were looking for them.
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  I mean, they know who has what app installed.
[41:02.000 --> 41:05.000]  So if the Twitter app is installed on everyone's iPhone,
[41:05.000 --> 41:06.000]  yeah, give me that first.
[41:06.000 --> 41:07.000]  But if Tweetbot is on,
[41:07.000 --> 41:09.000]  is the second most installed Twitter app
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  in the iOS ecosystem, show me that second
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  because likely I'll be really happy with it.
[41:13.000 --> 41:14.000]  Hmm.
[41:14.000 --> 41:17.000]  Let me take another break here and thank our next sponsor.
[41:17.000 --> 41:20.000]  It is our good friends at Warby Parker.
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.000]  Warby Parker makes buying glasses online easy and risk-free.
[41:24.000 --> 41:28.000]  Go to warbyparker.com slash the talk show
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.000]  and order your free home try-ons today.
[41:32.000 --> 41:33.000]  I've got Warby Parkers.
[41:33.000 --> 41:34.000]  I've got them.
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  They're great glasses.
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.000]  It could not be an easier way to shop for glasses.
[41:39.000 --> 41:40.000]  You go to the website
[41:40.000 --> 41:43.000]  and you start picking out the ones you want.
[41:43.000 --> 41:44.000]  You can pick up to five of them.
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  And if you only find like three,
[41:46.000 --> 41:47.000]  you can just order three and they'll throw in,
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.000]  they'll just take a guess and just throw in two extras.
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  Then like two days later, you get a box in the mail
[41:52.000 --> 41:55.000]  and it has five try-on versions of the glasses
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.000]  that you picked, the five that you picked,
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  you know, with just regular, you know,
[42:00.000 --> 42:01.000]  non-prescription lenses.
[42:01.000 --> 42:02.000]  You go, you try them on.
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.000]  You ask, you know, ask the people you live with
[42:05.000 --> 42:06.000]  or your friends, you know, do you like these?
[42:06.000 --> 42:07.000]  Do you not like these?
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.000]  You look in the mirror.
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  You find the ones you like.
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  You send them all back and they already have a sticker.
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  You just put the sticker on the same box.
[42:14.000 --> 42:15.000]  It just goes right back to Warby Parker
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  with these try-on ones.
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  And then a week later or so,
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  the ones that you picked come with your prescription
[42:22.000 --> 42:23.000]  and that's it.
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.000]  And it's so much cheaper than buying in like
[42:26.000 --> 42:27.000]  an eyeglass boutique.
[42:27.000 --> 42:30.000]  I think it starts at just 95 bucks.
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.000]  And they don't upsell you on coatings for the lenses.
[42:34.000 --> 42:35.000]  Do you want coatings?
[42:35.000 --> 42:36.000]  Do you want anti-glare?
[42:36.000 --> 42:37.000]  Do you want the nice lens?
[42:37.000 --> 42:40.000]  You just get the nice lenses with an anti-glare coating.
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  That's just the default.
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  They have a titanium collection.
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  These are like the metal ones that starts at just $145.
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.000]  And that includes prescription lenses.
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  And that's with premium Japanese titanium
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  and French non-rocking screws.
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  They even pay attention to the little details
[42:56.000 --> 42:58.000]  like putting nice screws in there.
[42:58.000 --> 43:00.000]  They also offer, and it's that time of the year
[43:00.000 --> 43:02.000]  where the sun's getting out,
[43:02.000 --> 43:05.000]  they offer prescription and non-prescription sunglasses.
[43:05.000 --> 43:07.000]  So even if you have 20-20 vision,
[43:07.000 --> 43:08.000]  there's something for you at Warby Parker.
[43:08.000 --> 43:11.000]  You can get really good, really cool sunglasses
[43:11.000 --> 43:13.000]  even if you don't need prescription.
[43:13.000 --> 43:18.000]  So you get good lenses, anti-glare, all of that.
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  You get really cool-looking frames.
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  You get to try them on at home.
[43:22.000 --> 43:23.000]  Nothing could be better.
[43:23.000 --> 43:24.000]  It's really, really great.
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  And even if you have a strong prescription,
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  like I do, I have a very strong prescription.
[43:28.000 --> 43:31.000]  They offer ultra-thin, high-index lenses
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  so that the actual lenses aren't thick.
[43:33.000 --> 43:36.000]  Back in the old days, if you had a strong prescription,
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  the stronger your prescription, the thicker your lenses were.
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.000]  You got what they call them, Coke bottle glasses.
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  You don't get that at Warby Parker.
[43:42.000 --> 43:43.000]  They have high-index.
[43:43.000 --> 43:45.000]  That means that they can do a strong prescription
[43:45.000 --> 43:47.000]  in a very thin lens.
[43:47.000 --> 43:50.000]  I could not be happier as a customer of Warby Parker.
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  They are just great.
[43:52.000 --> 43:53.000]  So go to Warby Park.
[43:53.000 --> 43:54.000]  If you need glasses of any kind,
[43:54.000 --> 43:58.000]  just go to warbyparker.com slash the talk show,
[43:58.000 --> 44:00.000]  and you will get a free home try-on
[44:00.000 --> 44:03.000]  and free shipping both ways and no obligation to buy.
[44:03.000 --> 44:04.000]  So if you don't want to buy, you get five of them.
[44:04.000 --> 44:05.000]  You don't like it?
[44:05.000 --> 44:06.000]  No obligation.
[44:06.000 --> 44:09.000]  So once again, warbyparker.com slash the talk show.
[44:09.000 --> 44:17.000]  And I thank them for sponsoring the talk show.
[44:17.000 --> 44:18.000]  What else is going on?
[44:18.000 --> 44:19.000]  There's Google I.O.
[44:19.000 --> 44:22.000]  Yep.
[44:22.000 --> 44:27.000]  I watched the keynote, and for the first time ever,
[44:27.000 --> 44:30.000]  I really thought that Google did a good job.
[44:30.000 --> 44:31.000]  It's the first time where I thought,
[44:31.000 --> 44:34.000]  wow, that was a really good keynote.
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  I had mixed feelings on it.
[44:36.000 --> 44:38.000]  I thought some of the technologies
[44:38.000 --> 44:43.000]  were more impressive than the way that they were presented.
[44:43.000 --> 44:44.000]  I could see that.
[44:44.000 --> 44:47.000]  And I do think that their culture,
[44:47.000 --> 44:49.000]  and again, this is the way most companies work.
[44:49.000 --> 44:51.000]  Apple is the exception,
[44:51.000 --> 44:55.000]  where Apple tends to have fewer people on stage.
[44:55.000 --> 44:57.000]  Apple's pacing in a keynote is always better
[44:57.000 --> 44:59.000]  than everybody else's.
[44:59.000 --> 45:00.000]  And for someone like me,
[45:00.000 --> 45:03.000]  whose default keynote to watch is an Apple keynote,
[45:03.000 --> 45:06.000]  it makes everybody else's seem a little,
[45:06.000 --> 45:09.000]  it's like, come on, tighten this up.
[45:09.000 --> 45:10.000]  Even the time it takes,
[45:10.000 --> 45:13.000]  even the time it takes to pass off to the next presenter
[45:13.000 --> 45:17.000]  is longer in a Google keynote than in an Apple keynote.
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  Well, tangentially, like we do this thing,
[45:19.000 --> 45:21.000]  it's finally called Jason Sonnell,
[45:21.000 --> 45:24.000]  and sometimes I help out where we transcribe the CEO,
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  like Tim Cook, historically, his comments.
[45:26.000 --> 45:28.000]  And I had to do that for,
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  we have a site now, Tesla Central,
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  for Elon Musk's last conference call.
[45:32.000 --> 45:34.000]  And it was so difficult,
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.000]  because Tim Cook is such a clean speaker,
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.000]  and Elon Musk, every second word was like,
[45:38.000 --> 45:42.000]  and he would interrupt himself halfway through every sentence,
[45:42.000 --> 45:45.000]  and it was incredibly hard to transcribe him,
[45:45.000 --> 45:49.000]  and it made me really appreciate just how well Apple,
[45:49.000 --> 45:51.000]  not just what they say,
[45:51.000 --> 45:53.000]  but how polished they all are as speakers.
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.000]  Yeah, because ultimately in a transcription like that,
[45:55.000 --> 45:58.000]  you're not doing like a legal transcription,
[45:58.000 --> 46:01.000]  where you're documenting every single word out of their mouth.
[46:01.000 --> 46:03.000]  You really want to get like a,
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.000]  that's what he meant to say, transcription.
[46:05.000 --> 46:07.000]  Not that you want to put words in his mouth,
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  but if he adds an extra like or an um or something like that,
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.000]  you don't want that in the transcription.
[46:11.000 --> 46:13.000]  What you're doing is trying to make a transcription
[46:13.000 --> 46:16.000]  that's easier for your readers to learn what he had to say.
[46:16.000 --> 46:18.000]  Like an idealized version of what he said.
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  Exactly, exactly, that's the right way to do it.
[46:20.000 --> 46:23.000]  And yeah, it's like with Tim Cook,
[46:23.000 --> 46:26.000]  it's a lot closer to the idealized version right out of his mouth.
[46:26.000 --> 46:28.000]  Yeah, and the same thing,
[46:28.000 --> 46:30.000]  so I watched some of it, some of it was super interesting.
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  They have new chat apps,
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  I just don't need new chat apps, I have so many of them already.
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.000]  So it would have been nice if those were sort of expansions of existing services.
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  I understand this, but they did this one duo,
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  which is just real time, it's like FaceTime,
[46:42.000 --> 46:45.000]  but the minute the call comes in, it's already streaming live video.
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.000]  And to me, I just know I'm going to get people sending me junk,
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  like their junk specifically, right away,
[46:50.000 --> 46:52.000]  and there'd be no way to avoid it.
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  I don't think that's going to work on iOS, though.
[46:54.000 --> 46:57.000]  It won't, but I mean, just the idea of it,
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.000]  like the idea of giving someone a direct,
[46:59.000 --> 47:01.000]  like they can just pop up in your eyeballs,
[47:01.000 --> 47:03.000]  is a recipe for disaster.
[47:03.000 --> 47:05.000]  Like you said before, humans cannot be trusted with this technology.
[47:05.000 --> 47:07.000]  Well, let's go through the stuff in order.
[47:07.000 --> 47:09.000]  We'll start with Google Home.
[47:09.000 --> 47:11.000]  Now, this leaked the night before,
[47:11.000 --> 47:13.000]  but it's not a surprise.
[47:13.000 --> 47:17.000]  And it was nice, Sundar Pichai actually called out Amazon
[47:17.000 --> 47:21.000]  and said Amazon's been doing good work in this area,
[47:21.000 --> 47:26.000]  which is sort of a tacit acknowledgment that this is a direct competitor.
[47:26.000 --> 47:29.000]  It's not like a tangential competitor.
[47:29.000 --> 47:34.000]  It's absolutely a dead-on direct competitor to the Amazon Echo,
[47:34.000 --> 47:39.000]  and that the family of devices that Amazon has developed around it.
[47:39.000 --> 47:42.000]  So Google Home is a little,
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  Syracuse calls it a weebl wobble.
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.000]  Remember the weebl wobbles?
[47:46.000 --> 47:48.000]  Yeah, it looks to me like an air freshener.
[47:48.000 --> 47:50.000]  They weebl and they wobble, but they won't fall down.
[47:50.000 --> 47:53.000]  They don't fall down.
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.000]  So it's a little speaker, pretty small, surprisingly small.
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  I thought when they first showed the product shots,
[47:58.000 --> 48:01.000]  I thought it was going to be more like Echo-sized, Echo-height,
[48:01.000 --> 48:04.000]  and it's a lot smaller than the Echo.
[48:04.000 --> 48:05.000]  So you plug it in.
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.000]  It is an always-listening speaker,
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.000]  and you say, like, hey, Google to it,
[48:11.000 --> 48:18.000]  and you can start a voice-driven assistant conversation with it.
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  Yeah, it was interesting to meet a couple of vectors.
[48:20.000 --> 48:23.000]  First, Amazon's been given a huge amount of credit
[48:23.000 --> 48:26.000]  for the Amazon Echo and for Alexa,
[48:26.000 --> 48:29.000]  but what always strikes me is that it is a U.S.-only product
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  and I believe still a unilingual product,
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  and it's impressive what they can do with it,
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  but the solution set that they have to offer
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.000]  is so incredibly small compared to what Apple or Google
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  are offering with multilingual support.
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  And, for example, with the Apple TV,
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  Siri not only does multilingual support,
[48:44.000 --> 48:47.000]  but they can do multiple languages within the same query.
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  Like, I speak French, too, so I can, in French,
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  ask for an English movie title,
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  and that is an incredibly hard problem to solve
[48:53.000 --> 48:54.000]  that Apple is solving.
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  And as far as I know, Alexa is nowhere near.
[48:56.000 --> 49:01.000]  So, yeah, Alexa handles American English queries really, really well,
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  but I think it's impossible at this point
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  to not realize, like, just how far ahead
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  Google really is in that sort of technology,
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  and I'm hopeful that by introducing this,
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  it will no longer be an English-only American product,
[49:12.000 --> 49:16.000]  but it will be something that becomes competitive internationally.
[49:16.000 --> 49:20.000]  Do you know, is Google home U.S.-only?
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  I think it might be starting that way.
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  The whole thing was kind of weird to me
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  because Sundar Pichai, I think he was the one
[49:26.000 --> 49:29.000]  giving the home pitch, at least in the beginning.
[49:29.000 --> 49:32.000]  He started off basically saying how wonderful it was
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  that Google understood context,
[49:34.000 --> 49:37.000]  and he basically described the sequential inference engine
[49:37.000 --> 49:38.000]  that Siri launched with.
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  Like, you could do the kind of...
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.000]  That's what I meant by the presentations
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  weren't as impressive as the technology.
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.000]  The things that he said Google Home could do
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  were things that Siri has done for years
[49:48.000 --> 49:51.000]  and things that Apple TV launched with months ago,
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.000]  and I believe, I firmly believe this technology
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  is beyond what Apple's doing with Siri right now,
[49:56.000 --> 49:57.000]  but he didn't show me that.
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  He made it sound like Google was inventing
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  the very basics of voice assistance.
[50:04.000 --> 50:08.000]  I will say, and I spoke about this last week on my show,
[50:08.000 --> 50:09.000]  well, I guess it was two weeks ago,
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  but the last episode with Ben Thompson,
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  who Ben Thompson is a bit...
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.000]  He's more of a bull on the Echo,
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  and I know Marco Arment is, too,
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  and I think the difference... I'm not.
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  I just got one a few weeks ago
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  because those guys were saying how good it was,
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  and I really, really do think
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  that this voice-driven assistant thing
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  is in the coming decade going to be...
[50:31.000 --> 50:32.000]  It's like the new touch.
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  Not that it's going to replace touch,
[50:34.000 --> 50:38.000]  but we're on the cusp of getting this to be really useful,
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  and therefore it's definitely going to happen,
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  and so I really want to stay up to date
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  with what everybody's doing,
[50:44.000 --> 50:45.000]  and it's easier for me to do it
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  because I'm in the U.S. and I speak English,
[50:47.000 --> 50:50.000]  so I can use Amazon's product.
[50:50.000 --> 50:54.000]  I think that those two are much happier
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  with the Echo than I am
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  because they have a lot of smart home stuff
[50:58.000 --> 51:01.000]  in their houses that hook up to the Echo,
[51:01.000 --> 51:02.000]  and I don't.
[51:02.000 --> 51:03.000]  I don't have any smart light bulbs
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  or anything like that,
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  and so therefore what the Echo does for me
[51:07.000 --> 51:10.000]  is almost nothing.
[51:10.000 --> 51:11.000]  I can get the weather,
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  and even with the weather,
[51:13.000 --> 51:14.000]  it's like a lot of times
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  I just want to know the temperature
[51:16.000 --> 51:19.000]  because I can see outside whether it's raining or not.
[51:19.000 --> 51:20.000]  It's in our kitchen,
[51:20.000 --> 51:23.000]  and we have a window like humans do,
[51:23.000 --> 51:26.000]  so I could see if it's sunny or overcast or rainy.
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  I just want to know if I need a jacket,
[51:28.000 --> 51:32.000]  and if I ask Alexa for the temperature,
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  she gives me the whole weather,
[51:34.000 --> 51:35.000]  including the temperature,
[51:35.000 --> 51:36.000]  but the temperature doesn't come
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  until halfway through the weather report,
[51:38.000 --> 51:42.000]  and Siri is better at stuff like that.
[51:42.000 --> 51:45.000]  You can ask Siri for the weather,
[51:45.000 --> 51:46.000]  and you'll get a whole weather forecast,
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  but if you just ask for the temperature outside,
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  she'll just tell you the temperature,
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  and I find that to be more useful.
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  There's several things here
[51:54.000 --> 51:57.000]  that at least for me are really interesting.
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  Amazon, again, that product is stuck in your house,
[51:59.000 --> 52:00.000]  and I have Siri on my wrist.
[52:00.000 --> 52:01.000]  I have it in my pocket.
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.000]  I have it on my lap with my iPad
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  and maybe soon with the Mac,
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  and so Siri goes with me everywhere,
[52:07.000 --> 52:08.000]  and that means that everything
[52:08.000 --> 52:11.000]  that I have connected to Siri is with me everywhere,
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  and I do have a lot of the connected technology in my house.
[52:13.000 --> 52:16.000]  Like, I have a lot of the Hue light bulbs, for example,
[52:16.000 --> 52:19.000]  but also the LED panels that I use for video podcasting
[52:19.000 --> 52:20.000]  are connected to an iHome plug
[52:20.000 --> 52:23.000]  because there's no Hue light bulb giant LED panels,
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  but because I named them correctly,
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  if I say turn on my studio lights,
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  it knows that the plug is called a light too,
[52:29.000 --> 52:30.000]  so it just turns it on,
[52:30.000 --> 52:31.000]  and suddenly every light is on there,
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  and if I say make the lights purple,
[52:33.000 --> 52:34.000]  it does all those things.
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.000]  And wait, what are you using to drive that, Siri?
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  Yeah, Siri does all of that for me.
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  And how did you connect that to Siri?
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  So, Siri works through HomeKit,
[52:43.000 --> 52:44.000]  so anything that's HomeKit-aware
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  will work with a series of commands with Siri,
[52:46.000 --> 52:49.000]  and it has triggers and it has rooms and it has events
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  and it has all sorts of really, really fun,
[52:51.000 --> 52:54.000]  really powerful stuff that you can use with it already.
[52:54.000 --> 52:57.000]  I don't, this is something I need to catch up on,
[52:57.000 --> 53:01.000]  but how do you configure stuff in HomeKit?
[53:01.000 --> 53:02.000]  Is there a HomeKit app?
[53:02.000 --> 53:03.000]  I don't even know.
[53:03.000 --> 53:06.000]  So, internally there's a home app that they haven't shipped,
[53:06.000 --> 53:07.000]  and rumor is, you know,
[53:07.000 --> 53:08.000]  every year they say they're going to ship it,
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  and the rumor is they'll ship it this year,
[53:10.000 --> 53:13.000]  but you can configure it in any HomeKit-aware app,
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  but I bought a $10 app off the app store called Home
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  that's really good, that just shows me every room in the house
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  and every device that's connected to it and every state of it,
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  and I can make changes in it very quickly.
[53:21.000 --> 53:24.000]  So, yeah, because I honestly wouldn't even know where to start.
[53:24.000 --> 53:27.000]  Like, if a whole bunch of HomeKit stuff showed up at my house
[53:27.000 --> 53:30.000]  and I plugged it in, I don't even know where to start in that iOS.
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  So, you're saying you got to get an app,
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  and so you got an app called Home,
[53:34.000 --> 53:37.000]  and Home is a third-party app that you paid 10 bucks for,
[53:37.000 --> 53:42.000]  and it uses Apple's HomeKit APIs that they've been talking about for a while
[53:42.000 --> 53:46.000]  to allow you to set this stuff up.
[53:46.000 --> 53:47.000]  Yeah, you just use the camera.
[53:47.000 --> 53:48.000]  You scan the barcode on the device.
[53:48.000 --> 53:49.000]  It sets it up for you.
[53:49.000 --> 53:50.000]  You give it a name.
[53:50.000 --> 53:51.000]  You assign it to a room.
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  You can have multiple houses set up.
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  You can, through iCloud, you can control things remotely
[53:55.000 --> 53:58.000]  so that if I'm not at home, I can still use Siri on my phone,
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  for example, to control the lights in the house.
[54:00.000 --> 54:03.000]  It works really, really well, and because it's not...
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  See, for me, Amazon has big problems, and that is, again,
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  they're U.S.-focused, but it's very unclear to me
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  that Amazon could ever have a presence in China
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  because they have their own retailers, and they have their own...
[54:11.000 --> 54:14.000]  And I want a product that, if I'm in Europe,
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  still works great for me, and if I'm traveling on business,
[54:16.000 --> 54:17.000]  or if I'm in China...
[54:17.000 --> 54:20.000]  Like, I speak very bad Mandarin, but I speak a little bit of Mandarin,
[54:20.000 --> 54:21.000]  and Siri supports that.
[54:21.000 --> 54:22.000]  It supports Hebrew.
[54:22.000 --> 54:25.000]  It does all these things to me that makes it a much...
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  It has the potential to be a much greater solution,
[54:27.000 --> 54:30.000]  and I think so does Google Now than anything Amazon is fielding.
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  Marco described Google...
[54:32.000 --> 54:38.000]  Or not Google Now, Alexa as sort of like a voice-driven command line,
[54:38.000 --> 54:42.000]  meaning that it's in the same way that a command line at the terminal,
[54:42.000 --> 54:47.000]  you have to put the arguments in the exact right order.
[54:47.000 --> 54:48.000]  It is rigid.
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.000]  Like, the command line is not plain English.
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  You know, you don't just type,
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.000]  show me a list of the files in this folder.
[54:55.000 --> 55:00.000]  You have to type LS, and if you type LS slash or dash A,
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  you get all of them, and, you know,
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  the arguments have to be the exact right way,
[55:04.000 --> 55:07.000]  and then once you learn those arguments to Alexa
[55:07.000 --> 55:10.000]  in the right order to put them, it is very, very reliable,
[55:10.000 --> 55:14.000]  and it's, you know, it's nearing 100% accuracy
[55:14.000 --> 55:18.000]  that the voice recognition will recognize it,
[55:18.000 --> 55:19.000]  will quickly parse it,
[55:19.000 --> 55:22.000]  and will quickly get the result back from the cloud.
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  But that's exactly why I think...
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  I'm not going to say a dead end,
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  because they can obviously scrap it
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  with a new engine at some point, but I just feel, though,
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  that that rigidity, that's what Marco likes,
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  that's what Ben Thompson likes about it,
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  that it's dependable because you can learn it,
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  but I also feel like ultimately it's limiting
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  because there's going to be so many things
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  we want to use these things for,
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  and I don't know.
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  I know a lot of people out there.
[55:46.000 --> 55:49.000]  Every time I mention that Siri has actually gotten a lot better,
[55:49.000 --> 55:52.000]  and it's noticeably improved to me in every way,
[55:52.000 --> 55:55.000]  both in terms of the speed, like when I just want to...
[55:55.000 --> 55:59.000]  And I know attributing it all to Siri is not quite right,
[55:59.000 --> 56:02.000]  because, like, if I'm just in iMessage
[56:02.000 --> 56:05.000]  and I'm walking on the sidewalk,
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  so I want to dictate a text message,
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  that's not really Siri.
[56:09.000 --> 56:10.000]  It's just the voice recognition,
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  but it does go round trip to the cloud,
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  and it is so much faster than it used to be.
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  It's even local on the latest iPhones.
[56:16.000 --> 56:17.000]  If you can't connect,
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  it'll still do a bunch of dictation locally.
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  Right, it'll do some of it locally.
[56:21.000 --> 56:22.000]  It's gotten so much better.
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  It's super useful to me.
[56:24.000 --> 56:27.000]  But I actually do use Siri quite a bit,
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  and there's so many things that Siri can do,
[56:29.000 --> 56:32.000]  and that if I just take a guess whether...
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  You know, that seems like something Siri could do.
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  I'm often right, and one of them, for example,
[56:36.000 --> 56:39.000]  is that Siri now knows the point spreads
[56:39.000 --> 56:43.000]  for, like, NFL games, NBA games.
[56:43.000 --> 56:47.000]  So, like, I wanted to know what the point spread was
[56:47.000 --> 56:51.000]  for the second Golden State Warriors-Oklahoma City game,
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  because I wanted to see if it went up,
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  because everybody was expecting Golden State to win
[56:55.000 --> 56:56.000]  because they lost game one,
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  and Siri instantly knew the point spread,
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  and I thought, I wonder if Alexa can do that.
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  Nope, no chance.
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  I use Siri all the time, too.
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  Like, if I'm driving, I'll just use Siri,
[57:06.000 --> 57:07.000]  and I have an idea for an article.
[57:07.000 --> 57:08.000]  I'll just tell Siri to take a note,
[57:08.000 --> 57:09.000]  and it comes out well enough
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.000]  that I can quickly put an article together.
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  But beyond that, what I really like about it is
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  it does do that sequential inference.
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  So if I, say, turn on my studio lights,
[57:17.000 --> 57:18.000]  it turns on the lights just in the studio,
[57:18.000 --> 57:19.000]  and if I, say, make them purple,
[57:19.000 --> 57:21.000]  it knows that I'm still talking about the lights,
[57:21.000 --> 57:22.000]  so it makes the lights purple.
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  If I, say, make them white,
[57:24.000 --> 57:25.000]  it'll say, I can't make them white,
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  but I can turn them into sunlight.
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.000]  And to me, that's kind of tedious,
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  because, like, just understand that I mean that anyway
[57:31.000 --> 57:32.000]  and do it. Don't give me the back chat.
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  But at least it's smart enough to not do
[57:34.000 --> 57:35.000]  what I was complaining about before,
[57:35.000 --> 57:36.000]  and that is to widen its search
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  and figure out what I want and do that,
[57:38.000 --> 57:41.000]  even if it's not exactly what I asked for.
[57:41.000 --> 57:45.000]  Yeah. So one of the things that Google Home does
[57:45.000 --> 57:47.000]  that seems really interesting
[57:47.000 --> 57:51.000]  is it integrates with Chromecast
[57:51.000 --> 57:53.000]  that you might have in your house,
[57:53.000 --> 57:55.000]  and there is an interesting demo
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.000]  in the demo video they had
[57:57.000 --> 58:00.000]  where there's a little boy asking something,
[58:00.000 --> 58:02.000]  some kind of question about space
[58:02.000 --> 58:03.000]  or something like that,
[58:03.000 --> 58:05.000]  and then he just said, put it on the TV,
[58:05.000 --> 58:09.000]  and it put whatever he was searching for on the TV.
[58:09.000 --> 58:12.000]  Now, some of that is a bit of a cheat
[58:12.000 --> 58:16.000]  because the TV, you know, at least my TV,
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  you would actually have to already have picked
[58:18.000 --> 58:20.000]  the Chromecast as the HDMI input
[58:20.000 --> 58:23.000]  and the TV would have to already be on.
[58:23.000 --> 58:26.000]  But still, that's a pretty cool trick.
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  Yeah, there's a lot of things in there
[58:28.000 --> 58:31.000]  that seem almost quasi-magical,
[58:31.000 --> 58:32.000]  and one of the big things,
[58:32.000 --> 58:33.000]  especially with the Amazon Echo,
[58:33.000 --> 58:34.000]  is the API access,
[58:34.000 --> 58:35.000]  and you've probably heard the same as I am
[58:35.000 --> 58:37.000]  that there's rumors of Siri APIs for years,
[58:37.000 --> 58:41.000]  but right now Apple has not shipped a Siri API,
[58:41.000 --> 58:43.000]  so third-party software and services
[58:43.000 --> 58:45.000]  beyond HomeKit can't access it,
[58:45.000 --> 58:47.000]  and that does limit what it can do.
[58:47.000 --> 58:49.000]  But I'm wondering when we eventually do get
[58:49.000 --> 58:51.000]  that new Apple remote app,
[58:51.000 --> 58:52.000]  if we'll have sort of the ability
[58:52.000 --> 58:55.000]  to control Siri on our Apple TV through our iPhone,
[58:55.000 --> 58:56.000]  because Apple is very good
[58:56.000 --> 58:58.000]  at sort of leveraging all their technologies
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  with things like continuity and handoff
[59:00.000 --> 59:02.000]  that will get sort of those abilities.
[59:02.000 --> 59:04.000]  And maybe Google is using the same thing
[59:04.000 --> 59:05.000]  that, you know, the Siri remote does
[59:05.000 --> 59:06.000]  when it turns it on,
[59:06.000 --> 59:07.000]  that the HDMI throughput tells the TV
[59:07.000 --> 59:09.000]  and everything else to go to the right place,
[59:09.000 --> 59:11.000]  and if you have the exact right setup, it'll all work.
[59:11.000 --> 59:13.000]  So I'll give a little bit of credit to that.
[59:13.000 --> 59:14.000]  As far as I know, it's not shipping for months, though,
[59:14.000 --> 59:16.000]  so it's still a preview,
[59:16.000 --> 59:17.000]  and you never know how much of a preview
[59:17.000 --> 59:19.000]  will actually be finished and ready enough
[59:19.000 --> 59:21.000]  to launch when the product goes out the door.
[59:21.000 --> 59:22.000]  Yeah, nothing.
[59:22.000 --> 59:23.000]  I don't think anything that they announced
[59:23.000 --> 59:25.000]  in the keynote yesterday is shipping yet.
[59:25.000 --> 59:29.000]  Even the software like Android N is still in beta,
[59:29.000 --> 59:31.000]  and the device is, quote,
[59:31.000 --> 59:34.000]  later this fall or something like that.
[59:34.000 --> 59:37.000]  Even the chat apps are,
[59:37.000 --> 59:40.000]  I think they said summer or something like that.
[59:40.000 --> 59:43.000]  I do question, big picture.
[59:43.000 --> 59:45.000]  I mean, well, do you think,
[59:45.000 --> 59:49.000]  so now of the three, of Amazon, Apple, and Google,
[59:49.000 --> 59:51.000]  now two of the three have announced
[59:51.000 --> 59:54.000]  this Echo-like standalone voice assistant device,
[59:54.000 --> 59:56.000]  a no-screen, just speaker,
[59:56.000 --> 59:59.000]  you talk to it and get audio out of it device.
[59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000]  Do you think Apple would ship a product like that?
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000]  I mean, there's been rumors of them doing that for a while,
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000]  and it was all mixed into,
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000]  like the Apple TV was a really complicated project,
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  and they went many, many directions with it
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  that are different than what they ultimately ship,
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  but there was this idea that it would be
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000]  the central home hub and would serve as a nexus
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  for controlling everything within your house,
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000]  and they ultimately didn't go that way,
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  but there's a lot of choices that Apple would have to make
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000]  to make that product.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  So like with the Apple TV,
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  they very clearly said that you have to hold down
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  this button when you talk to Siri,
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  and that's fine when you're just sitting there
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  in front of your TV with a remote,
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  but if you want a ubiquitous device that's like Echo
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  or that's like the Google Home device,
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  you have to eliminate that.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  You have to just let people talk to it,
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  which means you have to have a live mic in the living room,
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  almost like Microsoft did that with Kinect as well,
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  and Apple as a company has to be willing to say,
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  we're gonna put a live mic in your living room,
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  and this is very counter
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  to what they've done with their products previously.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  Yeah.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  I don't know.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  I don't think Apple would do this,
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  and I think that these voice-driven assistants
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  are absolutely positively gonna be,
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  they're already useful, but they're gonna be way,
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  you know, in 10 years from now,
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  we're gonna look back and say,
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  how did we get by without them?
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  I'm not sure that this standalone speaker microphone device
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  is the form factor to do it,
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  because it doesn't seem to scale,
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  and I know people asked,
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  I know some people were asking like,
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  well, what if you have multiple of these Google Home devices,
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  you know, one on each floor?
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  Did they work together?
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  And I think the answer is not yet.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  Like, I'm not quite sure that that's the answer
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  to how you have this everywhere you want it
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  is by setting up these speaker devices that,
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  you know, I almost feel like the speaker devices
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  should be dumb terminals, not the central hub.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  It's useful to have the speaker and say play the music,
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  you know, I'm gonna play the song right now,
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  and then it comes out and it sounds good,
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  and it's there to help listen,
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  but I don't think,
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  I think it should just be like a dumb terminal.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  It shouldn't really be the hub.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  Yeah, I went to a demo at Nuance,
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  like just in terms of the actual opposite of this,
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  I went to a demo, and Nuance has a press event,
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  and I went to look at it,
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  and they were showing their version of this,
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  and it was a couple years ago,
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  but they wanted to make sure that if you were talking,
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  you know, your kid couldn't interrupt you,
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  so you would snap your fingers twice,
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  and you'd have a camera and three microphones
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  beam form on you, and then as you walked around,
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  it would stay locked to you so you could talk,
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  and nobody else would get any crosstalk in on that,
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  and that to me was like the most overwrought
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  of all these possible solutions,
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  but then the other day, I was raising my arm
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  to just stretch, and I wanted to talk,
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  I wanted to ask Siri something, so I said,
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  you know, Siri, and because I was moving my arm,
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  my Apple Watch activated because I had an iPhone with me,
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  the iPhone activated, my 9.7-inch iPad Pro activated,
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  and because the 12-inch was plugged in,
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  that activated as well, so I had,
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  I just said to turn on the lights,
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  and then all these four or five voices
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  were said yes all at once.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  Now, the lights just went on,
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  so I don't know which one was ultimately responsible for it,
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  but it means like there's just so much potential
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  for a collision and sort of figuring out
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  what is the behavior, like how do you know
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  which device is closest to me,
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  or which one I'm talking to,
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  because maybe my watch is closer,
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  but I didn't move it, so Siri's not listening,
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  and maybe my iPhone is across the room
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  and my Mac is in my lap,
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  but I really am talking to my iPhone,
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  and solving those are interesting problems.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  Yeah, I would say that's exactly the point
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  I was gonna make is that, okay,
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  I don't think that this Echo-like speaker thing
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  is the ultimate solution to this,
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  to what is the device you buy to have this interaction
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  with a voice assistant, but conversely,
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  I don't know that Apple's like,
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  let's just have, hey, and then the name of the,
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  I don't wanna have to beep it out, hey, you know.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  Yo, Siri.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  Hey, you know.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  I don't think that's the answer either
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  to have it on all of your devices,
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  because I've had the situation, too,
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  where you try it and multiple devices are plugged in
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  and they all answer, or the iPhone doesn't even
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  have to be plugged in anymore.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  So I don't know what the answer is,
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  but it's definitely coming,
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  and I thought that some of the stuff
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  that they showed in the Google Home
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  is really impressive, but then some of it, too,
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  is also, it's so hand-wavy, it's like, are you serious?
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  It's like, you know, like, I could see,
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  like, the mom in the video, she got a notice
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  that her flight was delayed by half an hour,
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  and it's like, you know what, number one,
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  nobody ever, your flight is never delayed by half an hour.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  Like, if it's half an hour delayed,
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  you just bored late, they don't give you a warning.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  If your flight's delayed, it's like hours.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  But I think they wanted to make it like a nice, happy story,
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  so it's like, oh, your flight's delayed by half an hour.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  And so she said, move my dinner reservation
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  from 7.30 to 8, and it worked.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  And I could see that working,
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  because it's surely through OpenTable,
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  and I think OpenTable's AVPIs would allow that to work.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  But there were other things that they did
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  that it just seemed like, come on, it's too easy.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  You know, I absolutely agree,
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  and one of the things about this technology
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  is it really is a parallel interface.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  Like, we will still have our tactile interfaces,
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  but natural language and voice is so powerful
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  that we'll have these running in parallel,
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  and we won't really see, it's taken years to evolve,
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  just a lot of the basic things we now take for granted
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  on the old mouse interfaces
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  and now on the gesture-based interfaces,
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000]  and it'll take some time to sort of,
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000]  like, one of the things I worry about is immediacy.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000]  Like, I forget if it was this demo or the other demo
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000]  where it just said, you know, buy movie tickets.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  And I'm petrified. Ever since the iMessage changes,
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  yesterday I shared my location with somebody by accident
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  because it was instant,
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  and it wasn't a person that it was a problem for,
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  but location is highly sensitive information
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000]  and me hitting that by accident
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  and not having sort of a confirmed deny request
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  in between that was hugely problematic for me.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  And the same idea with here, like, just get movie tickets,
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  just make a reservation,
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000]  and I can go back and say, oh, no, don't make them,
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  but just the, we don't seem to have all the steps
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  that we have on our traditional interfaces
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  yet established for this.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000]  Yeah, I know Syracuse had called out the,
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000]  well, Get Indian Food, and it was like,
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  oh, hey, it'll be at your house,
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000]  and it's like no confirmation as to what you're ordering
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000]  or what restaurant.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000]  It's just, okay, there'll be Indian food
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000]  in a bag on your porch by the time you get home,
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000]  and it's like, come on.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000]  Oh, yeah, in the back.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000]  It's one of those things that's really hard to do by voice,
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000]  and it would have to,
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000]  it would necessarily require a lot of back and forth, right?
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000]  It should more or less be the same amount of back and forth
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  that you would have if you actually called the restaurant
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  and talked to a person.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000]  And you could have a standing,
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  like you could have gone to the trouble of pre-setting,
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  like this is my standard order.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000]  If I don't say anything else, this is the order,
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000]  but that's a lot of faffing work
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000]  that they don't show off in the beginning.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000]  And otherwise, exactly to your point,
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  there are sometimes when it's faster,
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  just tap a quick button
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  because your brain is reading all the information
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  on a screen and can react to it with fingers and taps
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  faster than it could
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000]  if you'd have a long, involved conversation with something.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  Yeah.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  I think I'm gonna buy one of these,
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  but I don't know that I'm going to leave it on.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  I don't know.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  I've still got the Echo downstairs,
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  but I might as well mention it
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000]  because in light of the...
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  I just don't see how you can avoid
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  the privacy implications of this.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  And even above and beyond the,
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  do you trust Amazon with an always-on microphone
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  in your kitchen?
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  Do you trust Google with this?
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  And the answer, obviously, for many, many people is yes.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  And is Google learning anything more about you
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  than it already knows
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  if you're a heavy Google services user?
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  But just think about it from a law enforcement angle.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  This is like a dream from the FBI.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  We're bugging ourselves.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  Right, because imagine if you're under investigation
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  and FBI goes to Google with a warrant and says,
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  you know, we're investigating this individual,
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  Rene Ritchie, does he have a Google home?
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  And if Google is legally compelled to say yes,
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  then they can issue a warrant that says,
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  well, we would like to have that microphone
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  recording everything that, you know,
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  please send us a 24-hour MP3 file
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  of everything that gets said every day in this house.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  Like, that is something that they could compel Google to do.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  It's funny, one of my favorite,
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  you know, it's not a phenomenal movie,
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  but there's a movie called Equilibrium,
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000]  and they have Christian Bale in it,
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  and he's a grammaton cleric,
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  and they want to kill him at the end,
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  and they say, what's the easiest way
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000]  to get your weapon away from you?
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  And he says, what?
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  And he says, to ask you for it.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000]  And it's true with passwords.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  I mean, any law enforcement will tell you
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  that often the easiest way to get something
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  is just to ask it,
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  because we're happy to do a lot of things to ourselves,
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  just out of convenience, with no sense of security.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  And that was one of the more troubling aspects
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000]  of the Google IOT of me,
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  is that a lot of the things that they're doing
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  requires me to remove encryption in order to have it done.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  Like, they showed off their,
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  and I know we'll get to it later,
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  but they showed off their chat app,
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  and they have an incognito mode,
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  and only when you go into incognito mode
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  does it have end-to-end encryption,
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  and that's because they want to do
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  a lot of machine-learning bots, you know, inside that.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  But that, to me, is dumb.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  If I'm talking to you, John,
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  and then I want to ask a bot something,
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  I still want that parsed.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  I want my communication with you to be end-to-end encrypted.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  Then if I address the bot, you know,
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  turn off the encryption,
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  if I go back to talking to you,
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  turn it back on again,
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  and for the very reasons you mentioned.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  Like, I have a personal belief
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  that our phones are like hard drives for our brains
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  and that they should be covered with a privilege
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  that is beyond what spouses or priests
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  or doctors or anybody enjoys in the law,
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  that they should just be almost inviolate
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  and that their data should not be accessible
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  to law enforcement.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  But we don't live in that world,
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  and the world we're living in now,
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  we are giving away and leaking so much data
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  that all of these products are a huge concern.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  Uh, yeah, you know,
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  I think that it's not going to keep people from using it,
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  and there's also been questions, you know,
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  now that our phones can listen to us,
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  is has law enforcement ever tried to compel Apple
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  or somebody else to turn your iPhone into a bug?
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  And I don't think that that's ever happened,
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  and I'm not, you know, but it's obviously a concern
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  now that we have these devices
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  that are literally always listening to us.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  I mean...
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  Did you see the Edward Snowden documentary?
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  No, I haven't seen it.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  It's great.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  There's a scene in the very beginning,
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  and they're filming him,
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  and it's actual film of him doing the first interviews
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  that led to the articles, I believe, in The Guardian.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  And right away, there's an IP phone on the table,
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  and he unplugs it, takes it apart,
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  and they're saying, why are you doing that?
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  And he said, it has a speaker.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  And they said, it's not on.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  He goes, what do you mean it's not on?
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  I used to sit on the opposite ends of these things,
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  and he would put his blanket over his head
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  to type in his password,
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  because there were cameras outside of the windows.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  And he's like, you don't understand the degree
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  to which we are doing surveillance on you.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  That's creepy.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  What's the name of the documentary?
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  It's chilling.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  Citizen 4, Citizen 5, or something like that.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  No, I haven't seen it.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  I can't really say why,
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  because it's something I'm interested in,
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  and I love a good documentary.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  It's terrific.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  And I know that the feature film is coming out soon
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  with Edward Norton, right?
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  Isn't Edward Norton playing?
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  Sort of a dead ringer.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  Yeah.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  And all these things go through your mind.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  And Apple's taking great pains to take care of security,
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  and they're building systems
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  that they themselves cannot get into.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  And that's the thing,
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  is that you might trust Google with your data,
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  but once someone else has your data,
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  I'll take responsibility for losing my own data,
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  but once somebody else has it,
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  even if they don't do anything bad with it,
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  they're like employees at that company,
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  or that company gets exploited
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  or some place that they're using to store data
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  gets broken into.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  It creates this ability for that information
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  to get even further out.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  It's just one step removed.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  It's one step less safe.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  We don't think about it,
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  because convenience is such a good selling point,
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  but this is super valuable thing.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  It's the most valuable thing that we have,
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  is our information.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  And I really worry about a lot of these products
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  and what they'll turn us into.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  Yeah.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  So the next thing they did announce,
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  and you mentioned it,
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  it's their new chat app.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  It's, you know, effectively, it's like they're...
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  Well, Google has had a lot of chat apps over the years.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  So they're starting over with a new one.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  It's called Allo.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  A-L-L-O.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  It's like French for hello.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  Obviously.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  Allo.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  Not a bad name. I like it.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  But they've wiped the slate clean.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  This is not Google Hangouts.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  This is a new thing.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  It's a chat app,
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  so it's sort of a cross between iMessage
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  and, like, WhatsApp or something like that.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  And it's not Spaces,
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  which they introduced, I think, three days before this one,
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  which also has chat features.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  Yeah, that's curious that they released Spaces before this
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  and then didn't talk about Spaces in the keynote at all.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000]  I haven't really looked closely at Spaces yet,
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  but I've heard from a couple people that I should,
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  because it looks like a really, you know,
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  seems like a really useful thing.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  I just have so much fatigue.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  It's like the virtual real estate is free,
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  so people can build as many things as they want.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  But it's almost like if you have a garden
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  and you're tending it
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  and somebody gives you another garden
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  and you've got to tend that
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  and then another garden and then another garden
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  and you start forgetting about the first one.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  And it feels that way with all these programs.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  Like, I still have people contacting me on Hangouts.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  No Google Wave anymore, thankfully.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  But, you know, there was Google Buzz
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  and then there's Google Spaces.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  And people have expectations once you use that,
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  if they send you a WhatsApp message or a Snapchat,
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  that you're going to get back to them.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  And there's just more and more proliferation
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  of all these services,
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  and it doesn't look like it's slowing down.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  Just the demands on our attention are ridiculous.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  Yeah.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  And people's not doing anything coherent with it.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  And I understand it's easier for them
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  to launch them a separate service,
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  but it's going back to what we were talking about with Apple.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  It's not their job to do things that are easy for them.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  It's their job to do things that are better for me.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  And my world, maybe burying it all in Slack
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  would be the best thing.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  But, you know, Google could make a product
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  that is coherent and that produces these features
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  and gets rid of ones that they don't find as valuable anymore.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  That would be better for me as a customer.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  The thing about Allo is the privacy thing that you said.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  So there's two modes in Allo.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  And the default mode includes, like, the, you know,
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  what's new is that it includes a Google bot interaction.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  And so you can, like, at Google and, you know,
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  in the middle of your chat and get answers to questions
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  that you could ask Google.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  I can imagine that being useful.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  But it seems weird that it's the default.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  And then they call the other mode incognito mode,
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  which to me is very problematic.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  I really, really don't like using that.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  And I know that the term comes from Chrome,
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  where that's what they call the private mode for your tabs.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  And I guess they're, you know, if you want to be,
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  give them the benefit of the doubt,
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  that's why they chose the word incognito.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  But to me, calling it incognito
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  puts a slightly negative connotation on it,
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  that it's, you know, that that's something that you use
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  for something that you want to keep secret.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  Or something where you want to be anonymous
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  or you want to hide.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  And it sort of carries, like, a negative connotation to me.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  Whereas the word private,
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  which is what I think they should call it,
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  and I think it should be the default,
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  is, well, of course you want privacy.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  You know, who doesn't want privacy?
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  And, you know, as Christopher,
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  I'm going to botch his last name.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  Soyihan, how do you pronounce his name?
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  I'm not sure.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  Do you know who he is?
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  No.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  He's a privacy advocate,
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  and he's a super good follower.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  I'll put his Twitter in the show notes.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  Thank you.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  But as he described it yesterday,
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  the default mode of Allo,
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  which is encrypted, but it's not end-to-end encrypted.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  So the privacy mode and the way iMessage works,
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  and I think the way WhatsApp works is end-to-end encrypted.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  So if I send a message on iMessage to you,
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  it is encrypted leaving my phone,
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  and it isn't decrypted until it gets to your phone.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  And in between, like, when it's in Apple's hands,
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  it is in an encrypted state that they can't read.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  That's end-to-end encryption.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  Apple's really only there to facilitate the, you know,
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  connecting your Apple ID to your phone.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  It's just a route, and it's end-to-end encrypted.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  That's, you know, the term is exactly what it sounds like.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  And it makes it impervious to person-to-person
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  in the middle attacks, which is the important thing.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  Yes, right.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  So if somebody, you know, hacks my, or, you know,
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  if I'm in Starbucks and I'm using the Wi-Fi
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  and somebody else, you know, is, you know,
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  is reading all the stuff that goes through the Wi-Fi router,
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  all they see is the encrypted version of the message.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000]  The default mode for Allo that includes the Google bot
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  by definition in order to have this interaction with the Google bot.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  It is over HTTPS, but it's encrypted from you to Google server.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  Then Google sees what you type,
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000]  and then Google encrypts it to send it on to you.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  That's, like, exactly how the FBI wants all of these services to work.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  That's exactly what the FBI has been pushing for
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  in this entire argument.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  And maybe, you know, not just the FBI here in the U.S.,
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  but law enforcement, you know,
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  like-minded law enforcement in Europe and elsewhere.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  And I'm certain that the Chinese government
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  would like to see messaging services work like that, too,
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  because if it's only secure over the air from me to Google,
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  and then it's unencrypted on Google's side,
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000]  then if Google has served a warrant to say,
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  let us see these messages, we're really, you know,
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  we're conducting an investigation between John Gruber and Rene Ritchie.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  They're running some kind of scam.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  We need to see their messages.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  There they are, right?
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  I mean, I understand why Google's doing it,
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000]  because they're all about machine learning,
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  and the more data you feed that, the better it is.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  And they're getting access to what we're typing,
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  how we're typing it, when we're typing it.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  All those discussions, it really feeds, at an enormous scale,
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  it feeds their machine learning
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  and their artificial intelligence projects.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  And they're giving me a free service in exchange,
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  and convenience is always at war with security.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000]  But to your point, what Google wants here happens to be what everybody else wants.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  And you could make a case that Google will protect it,
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  but Google is bound by laws,
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000]  and we don't know what those laws are going to be yet.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000]  But also, Google is subject to abuse.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  And we saw with the NSA, when they started having access to this data,
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000]  they didn't just use it for legitimate and noble government purposes,
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000]  but they used it to keep track of ex-girlfriends
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000]  and to spy on people and to do things.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  And you can say that won't happen,
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000]  but the best way for that not to happen is what Apple's doing,
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  where they themselves do not have access to it.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.000]  And I know for a fact that iMessage was architected with that in mind.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  It was the high-level, one of the top bullet items was,
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000]  we need to design this system from the ground up
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  so that we cannot see these messages,
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  even if compelled to do so by a warrant.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  And FaceTime too, which is why it's allowed to be used in the medical industry,
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  because it's end-to-end encrypted,
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  and there's no chance for someone to intercept that and have private data leaked.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  They've been doing this with all their services systematically.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000]  Yeah, so I really...
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  There's no other way for Google to do this with the bot, I don't think.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  I guess there are other ways where it would have to be, like you said,
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  where everything I typed to you is still end-to-end encrypted,
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  but only the at-Google ones are not.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000]  And I really feel like that they should,
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000]  and it doesn't seem like they're doing it,
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.000]  I think that they should do something visual,
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  like the way that iMessage does green bubbles for SMS
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  and blue bubbles for iMessages.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  They should do something to make clear what is end-to-end encrypted and what is not.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  And I really kind of feel like they drop the ball by doing this
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000]  the way that they're doing it.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000]  I mean, it's sort of deliberate, but I really do feel like it's a problem.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  I mean, it's a service that I wouldn't want to rely on.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000]  And to your point, I mean, using the term incognito,
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000]  it's baffling to me because they're using your phone number as a unique identifier,
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.000]  and that means that by definition you're not incognito.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  And if I'm messaging you in incognito mode, we still know who each other are.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.000]  There's no identity questions there.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  Right. It's not incognito.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  It's really a problematic use of the word.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  I really do think so, because it's not the same as Chrome.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  Chrome, when you go into incognito mode, you really are anonymous,
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000]  or at least if it works the way it's designed,
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  obviously there could be a bug or something.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000]  Even there, it stops your history and it stops the cookies,
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.000]  but unless you're using some form of ad tracker and all those things, blockers,
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000]  it's not stopping the web from monitoring your progress in general.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000]  You have to go incognito and block everything else.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.000]  Yeah, and it doesn't route you through some kind of anonymizing service.
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.000]  Either your IP address is still just your IP address,
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000]  but it is cut off from your regular cookie stash and et cetera.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000]  You search history.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000]  Then next, the sibling.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  Oh, by the way, we should say that Apple actually, I think,
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000]  does call this privacy mode, and they're the ones who started it.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000]  Yes, in Safari, you mean?
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000]  Yes.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  Yeah, it's a new private window.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  Yeah.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  But again, their use of incognito in Allo is really not that similar to Chrome,
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  and like you said, it's still your phone number.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000]  I say thumbs down.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  Thumbs down on the architectural design of Allo,
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:54.000]  or at least the defaults should be flipped, in my opinion.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000]  The default should be what they call private mode,
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000]  and then you should be able to turn on, you know,
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000]  give me some help from Google bot mode,
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000]  and then there should be a very clear visual indication
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000]  that you're no longer private.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  Yeah, and the whole, again, like I said,
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000]  the technology was impressive, but the presentations,
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.000]  I think, did not do them any service.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  It's unclear to me.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.000]  You and I are chatting on iMessage, and I'm researching a Scotch thing.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  It reminds me almost of those really, really early adventure games
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000]  where you're standing on the edge of a forest,
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000]  and it's a river to one side, and you type and pick up the sword,
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000]  and it does that.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  It's not always an optimal form.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000]  I mean, we replace that.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  Those aren't how games run anymore.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  We replace that with easier, more direct forms of manipulation,
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000]  and it's not clear to me exactly what, like you said,
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000]  or Syracuse has said about the curry,
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  it's not clear to me how efficient this form of communication will be.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000]  There will be specific cases where it's very useful,
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  but do I want my entire chat experience subsumed with these little use cases
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000]  that I might not ever put to use?
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000]  Yeah.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  So the sibling app to Allo is called Duo,
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  and I think it's very fair to say it's their answer to FaceTime.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  It is live video chat.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000]  I don't know.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  There might be an audio mode.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  I mean, it doesn't demo as well, but it's live video.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  It is a companion to Allo,
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  so I'm guessing it still uses your phone number as an identifier.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:18.000]  It is going to be cross-platform, iOS and Android,
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  and like you said earlier, you hinted at it.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  They have a feature they call knock-knock preview,
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:27.000]  which means that if I call you, it'll start the video on me,
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:34.000]  and the notification that you get when it rings or whatever,
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000]  when I'm knock-knocking you,
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.000]  it'll already show you where I am, who I am, and what I'm doing.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000]  You'll already have the video to look at.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  I don't know who thought this was a great idea.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000]  I understand they use someone's kids as a demo,
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000]  but I don't know who decided that anybody has the right
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000]  to put live video on my home screen without my consent
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000]  or my lock screen without my consent because we know people.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000]  It's not going to end up well for us.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  Well, yeah.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000]  Like if I know you're having a meeting.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000]  No, my phone rings and all of a sudden
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000]  it's every inch of guy English on my home screen.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000]  I mean, it's just not going to work well.
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000]  It's an interesting demo, and like you said,
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  it may not be a good feature.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  And on iOS, it's 99.999% certain there's no way that's going to work
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000]  because that's something that's only going to be on Android.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  Yeah, well, you have to have the app open and sitting there
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000]  waiting for the person to call,
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  at which point it kind of defeats the purpose.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000]  Right. If you're already in the app, they could do it,
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:37.000]  but otherwise it's just going to be a standard notification.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000]  Again, another separate application.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:45.000]  Yeah. Well, it's the same reason that FaceTime is a separate application.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.000]  It is, but Apple doesn't have FaceTime plus an app like Hangouts
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000]  that already does very similar things to this.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000]  I mean, it's layer upon layer of Google communication apps at this point.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  Yeah, I think it's interesting to me that they're doing it,
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  and I wonder, unlike with Amazon and the Echo where they called it out,
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000]  they didn't mention Apple and FaceTime, but especially with the Duo.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  And I think it's fair to say that Allo is as much a competitor to WhatsApp
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  and Line and all the other, you know, there's so many messaging apps that are out there.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  You can't just say it's a direct answer to iMessage,
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  and iMessage is a little different. iMessage doesn't have stickers,
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  and it's really more about replacing SMS text messaging.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  But with Duo, it's impossible not to talk about this and not mention FaceTime.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  It looks like FaceTime. I mean, the screen just looks like FaceTime.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  Yeah, and I just think that they're answering for Android users a need that, you know,
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  that's like a cool thing that iPhone users have been using for years,
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  and, you know, there hasn't been a good answer for Android users, and now there will be.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  And it's interesting because FaceTime, I mean, well, the story is well known.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  Steve Jobs announced it was going to be an open standard,
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  and much to the surprise of the engineers sitting in the audience at the time.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  And then Apple got sued by Vertimex, and basically they had to re-architect the entire system
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  based on, you know, rocket docket Texas patent law.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.000]  And I believe they've gone to court three times, and I'm not sure what the status is now,
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  but it really hamstrung the roadmap for FaceTime.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  It gets years later, and we have FaceTime audio now,
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  but we don't have FaceTime conference calls,
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  and there's all sorts of really obvious features that Apple,
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  just being sued into oblivion by this company, has not been able to roll out.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  And the technology behind Duo is super interesting to me,
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  and they're using WebRTC. I think that's what they're doing.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  And the way that they're implementing it, really, really interesting,
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000]  but it'll need to evolve, too.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  Like Skype has got all these features, and Hangouts has conference calls.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  I'm not sure what the exact difference is, why they don't get sued the way that Apple has,
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.000]  but it really does sort of open up that sort of cross-platform dynamic
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  that you want from services like these.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  Yeah, definitely. So it would be interesting to see what kind of uptake it gets.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  I kind of salute them. I feel like these are focused apps,
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:08.000]  and the point is very clear, and it's sort of the opposite of...
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  What was that thing that Google built a couple years ago,
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  and it eventually disappeared, but it was like...
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  Wave.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  Yeah, that's it. Google Wave. Right. It's the opposite of Wave.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  It's the antithesis, where Wave was so nebulous and so grandiose in its ambitions
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  that they lost the point of, hey, I'm looking at this thing, and I just don't get it.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  It was like WikiChat. It was very strange.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  It was super ambitious, but it really was not a good product.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  I mean, it was a fascinating research endeavor,
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  but it was just nowhere near as cohesive as a product needs to be,
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  whereas these new apps are so super focused.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  Okay, it's messaging. Oh, and it's video. It's like FaceTime.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  Yeah, almost like unitaskers, and Apple, again, famously never put FaceTime on Android.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  People still want iMessage on Android,
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  and Apple historically has not been great at services
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  and not been great at cross-platform apps,
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  so wanting those two things together is a curious choice
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  when you hear people complain about it.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  Google has been really good about putting apps on iOS,
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  and there's profound business reasons for why they do that,
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  but their apps have not been great on iOS.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  From the design where they insist on making them very Android-like,
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  with Roboto and with a lot of the hamburger buttons,
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  to the performance on like Hangouts.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  Hangouts has gotten better, but Hangouts was a dumpster fire for far too long,
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  so having these stripped-down apps could mean that they're actually decent apps on iOS,
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  and then you solve that cross-platform problem.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.000]  Yeah, we'll have to see, but again, later this summer, not available now.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  No.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  What else do we have here? We've got Android N, they announced.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  Are they going to let the internet name it? I think that was the general.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  Yeah, that seems weird. I don't know what the...
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  I don't know. That seems pretty stupid to me.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  I'm guessing that they already have a name
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  and that they're just saying that they're letting the internet name it.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  Nutella or...
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  No, they can't use Nutella, though. It's a trademark.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  Well, they used KitKat. They came to a licensing agreement to use KitKat.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  Yeah, so maybe that's what they'll do. Maybe they'll pay the Nutella people.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  Or just go with Nougat and screw it.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  I'm trying to think from the Android N. I have my notes here.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  The one thing that was interesting to me,
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000]  the most interesting thing that they showed were these.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  I forget what they call it, but it's like instant app something.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  Yeah, so it's basically streaming apps.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  Yeah, and that if you architect your Android app the way that...
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  This is a new thing.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  But if you architect, you can divide your app up into slices
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  and more or less componentize your app.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  It can load just the component that it needs to do something
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.000]  and will more or less load it like a web page.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:09.000]  So it'll just load right over the air and all of a sudden you're in the app,
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  but it hasn't downloaded the entire app.
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:16.000]  It's just the piece that it needs to do a thing.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  So maybe if you're OpenTable, I forget what demos they use,
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:23.000]  but if you're OpenTable, it could just show you the screen that you use
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  to make a reservation and you pick a time and then you're in.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  You're in with the reservation.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  And then if you want the rest of the app, you can say,
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  give me the rest of the app and then it'll download the whole thing.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000]  It's really interesting to me because a lot of us have been there
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  where we're out, we're traveling, maybe we're roaming,
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  we have a poor connection, we want to do something,
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  but we just don't happen to have the app installed
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000]  and you go to the app store and you have one bar
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000]  and you're trying to download it and you're just watching the thing try to turn
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000]  and you just wish you'd had that app installed.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000]  You'd remember to do it at the hotel on Wi-Fi.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000]  So it is an absolute problem.
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.000]  But to me the bigger picture here is that we've been seeing for a while,
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000]  and you've been talking about this for a long time,
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000]  how there used to be websites and then just things started happening over HTTP
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000]  and they became web services and you had APIs and endpoints
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000]  and maybe they would show up on the web but maybe they'd show up on apps
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000]  or maybe they would service in some other type of client.
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.000]  And it really changed the fundamental meaning of what it meant to be a web service.
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.000]  And now that's been happening with apps and we saw it with extensibility on iOS
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:25.000]  where previously you had to take a photo, go out to a photo app, make an edit,
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.000]  go to another photo app, make an edit, go back to maybe go to Pinterest
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000]  or to Tumblr and share it and it was super inconvenient
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000]  but you went to all these different destination apps
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000]  where now thanks to extensibility you just pull out the features of an app.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.000]  I use PCALC in shade now. I never go to the PCALC app.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000]  I share to social networks using the share sheet.
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000]  I never actually launch social network apps.
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000]  And that has profound meaning to the brands of those apps
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.000]  because they no longer control those experiences.
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:56.000]  Maybe it will show up on my watch or overcast might be on my CarPlay dashboard
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000]  and the logic and the interface layers are totally decoupled
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.000]  and the binary has been separated out into all these features
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000]  and now these features are being streamed, at least in Google's world,
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000]  it's being streamed back almost like web services
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.000]  and it makes you really question what an app will be,
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.000]  never mind five years from now but two or three years from now
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000]  and what that means for developers and for services.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000]  It's fascinating to me. It's a really neat trick.
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000]  I'm not quite sure if it's a good idea or not.
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000]  Is it something Apple would do? I don't know because Apple is pretty...
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000]  because it doesn't even ask you if you want the app.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:31.000]  It just all of a sudden you're in it in the same way that when you tap a URL
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000]  it just takes you to the web page.
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:38.000]  You tap a URL and it's sort of like the way that...
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000]  you know, like the Twitter app can say,
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:45.000]  hey, I own the twitter.com domain name so now let the user choose
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:49.000]  whether tapping a tweet URL takes you to the web page
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:52.000]  or opens the Twitter app right to the tweet.
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:57.000]  So that's what this is doing on Android except it's letting you run apps
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000]  you haven't even installed yet.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000]  Apple would allow that, even the technology behind it aside.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000]  I just don't think Apple would do it because they don't want to...
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:10.000]  they're so conservative about letting native software run on the device.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.000]  Yeah, like the Google approach almost seemed like feature caching,
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000]  like you're going out grabbing a bit of a web page,
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000]  treating it a bit like an app so it performs better
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:22.000]  or maybe has advantages or access that a web page wouldn't get.
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000]  And that's true.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:29.000]  Every year there's a technology that fascinates me in WWDC
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000]  and two years ago it was extensibility
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.000]  and last year it was all the app thinning stuff,
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000]  the app slicing and on demand resources
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000]  because we're starting to see that.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  You don't have to download every iPad version of the interface
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000]  just to get the iPhone app
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000]  and you don't have to download the 32-bit if you're running a 64-bit device
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.000]  and you don't have to download ten levels if all you need is one.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000]  And you start to think about that like on an Apple TV
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000]  where if your kid is playing and you don't ever want them to see a dialogue
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000]  that says you're out of space, please go delete something
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000]  because that's just a terrible experience.
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:01.000]  So it's handling all of that stuff dynamically in the background.
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000]  And even multitasking now is just in time multitasking.
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.000]  It's not the old concept of multitasking anymore.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000]  And this is becoming almost like a real-time world
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000]  where you don't have to preload a bunch of apps
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.000]  and you can have a bunch of features.
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000]  And I agree with you.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000]  I don't think Apple would do it in this way,
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000]  but I think extensibility and the creative ways they've been using it
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000]  and it's underpinning a lot of technologies in iOS 9
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000]  like the game recording, for example, is run through an extension
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000]  so that the game has no idea what you're recording
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.000]  and no access to your movie,
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  but that could easily be split out into a separate screen recording functionality.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.000]  I think that's sort of that future that we're going to
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.000]  where we're not going to be bound by these binary blobs on our screens anymore.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000]  I found it in my notes.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  It's called Android Instant Apps.
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  And one of the things that's interesting about me is just the big picture
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  that it is a full embrace of the native app as an important thing
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.000]  by Google, who's known as a web company.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  Yes.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:34:00.000]  To me, it's a tacit acknowledgement that native apps are better than web apps
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.000]  because this is a way that native apps are getting a lot more webby,
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:09.000]  to put it one way, where the same way that you don't have to download,
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  you don't install a web page.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  You just go to the URL and it loads.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  This is the same thing.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  You don't have to worry about installing an app.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  You just tap a URL and a part of the app just instantly loads.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  To me, it's just a tacit acknowledgement that native apps are superior,
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  especially on mobile devices.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000]  I don't know if they announced it,
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.000]  but I think there was that whole thing about Android apps on Chrome as well.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  What does that mean?
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  Because Chrome, to me, was like the most Google operating system.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  It was a cloud-first web-centric operating system,
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000]  but you have to start running Android apps.
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  What does that mean about the future of those cloud-centric web apps?
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  Yeah, well, I think maybe it's wrong to describe that as the most Googley.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  It's the most webby.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000]  And there's a lot of people, and for a lot of years,
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:59.000]  it seemed like Google as a company was dominated by people who have that,
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000]  hey, the web is the future.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  Everything's going to run in a browser tab eventually mindset.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  And I think that what we're seeing is that that's no longer true of Google.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000]  Here it is.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  So Chromebooks will be able to run Android apps when the feature arrives
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:18.000]  later this year, and that, to me, is really, really interesting.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  Yeah, but I wonder, though, how well that's going to work.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000]  It's been a while since I've tried an Android tablet,
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  but it just seems to me like so many Android apps are only meant to be run on phones.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  And I guess what they could do is just show a phone-size slice of the Chromebook,
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  just make a little cell phone dimension window.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  I don't know, because they don't really have windows.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  They just have tabs.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  Yeah, there's been companies that have been trying to do stuff like this for a while.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000]  There was a rumor that WebOS was going to run on HP computers
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  when they first bought the company, and that didn't really go anywhere.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  But I think, again, to your point, there's still things that native apps do
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  that web-based technologies don't do.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  Yeah, well, all right, before we wrap up, let me thank our third and final sponsor of the show,
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  and this is Wealthfront.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  Wealthfront is an automated investment service
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:21.000]  with over $3 billion in client assets under management.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  It is passive and low-cost.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  So what you do, you should use Wealthfront to invest your money for the long term.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  This isn't like day trading. It's the opposite.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  Clients love Wealthfront because the automation allows them to just set it and forget it,
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  leading to better long-term results.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  It's not for the short term, not for day trading.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  Research shows that when individuals attempt to time the market
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  and just buying and selling and all this stuff, individual stocks,
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  and predicting what's going to go up and what's going to go down,
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:56.000]  they underperform the averages, like the S&P 500 or index funds,
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  because of the higher costs, because when you're actively trading and selling and buying,
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  you pay transaction costs on every one, every trade,
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:10.000]  and you pay higher taxes and you make mistakes with timing the market.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  Wealthfront charges no trading commissions
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  and performed over 2.5 million free trades for our clients in 2015 alone.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  That's over $20 million in saved fees at just $8 a trade, which is a low cost.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  They charge an advisory fee of 0.25%, one quarter of 1%, on assets above 10 grand.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:38.000]  And clients can get an additional $5,000 managed free for each friend they invite
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  who ends up funding their account.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  And if you sign up using this URL, wealthfront.com slash the talk show,
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  wealthfront.com slash the talk show,
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  you'll just by starting out get up to $15,000 instead of 10,000 managed fee free.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  So up to $15,000, you pay no fees.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  $15,000 and above, you pay a management fee of just one quarter of 1%.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  That is so much below the normal rate that you get from a financial advisor.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  It's absurd.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  So you pay low fees.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  They optimize the investment strategy to minimize your taxes in the long run
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  and maximize the amount of money that you're going to make in the long run on your investment.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  So if you are looking for a better, smarter way to invest your money for the long term,
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  go to wealthfront.com slash the talk show.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000]  My thanks to them.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  Anything else that you noticed at Google I.O.?
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.000]  Well, I had this sort of general feeling when I was watching this,
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  and I don't know if I'll have the same feeling at WWDC,
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:50.000]  that we're sort of getting to this point where we're getting most of the functionality we need out of these devices.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  And the announcements that are being made are, you know, they're not startling technologies anymore.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  It's like the first time you saw the App Store, the first time you saw Siri,
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  or the first time you saw some of the multi-touch technologies.
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  They were just so different than what we've seen before.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  And now we're seeing things that are either filling in the gaps that other vendors make that maybe they don't have already,
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  or they're things that just build on.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  And maybe bots and machine learning are the big things now,
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  but they're sort of factored into apps that we know and use already.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  And it reminded me of the talk you had, I think it was last week, about iPhone 7.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  And the Internet is just falling over itself saying, oh, it's going to be boring.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  It's going to look the same.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  And I went and looked, and the last three Galaxy phones all looked the same,
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  because we're getting to a point where we know how a phone should look.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000]  And if Apple wanted to, they could make a triangle.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  It wouldn't be boring, but it would be stupid to use.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  So I just wonder how much of this is really going to be exciting
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  as the very early days, the frontier days of mobile technology,
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  and how much we're going to complain about boredom
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  when really we're getting just exactly what we need now.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  I think there's a huge chunk of the technology press,
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:57.000]  and not just the people who write about it,
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  but some of the enthusiasts who follow this stuff,
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  who have just a childlike attention span and a need for novelty
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  that bears no relation to the general public,
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  and they miss the forest for the trees, really,
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  because there's so much that is interesting on these devices
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  if you dig into them and get into the details.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  And so many people just want to, here, just show me what it looks like
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  and let me see if it looks new or not.
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000]  And if it doesn't, then it's boring.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000]  And it's just absurd.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  And other products aren't like that.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  This is a sign that it's...
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  And of course there was, in the early years,
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  of course the iPhone changed more dramatically in the first five years
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:46.000]  when it would go from the 3GS to the iPhone 4.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  I mean, it was a huge, really dramatic,
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  just look at the device physical change.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  It went from non-retina to retina,
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:58.000]  it went to a flat back with the antenna on the outside of the sides.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  Well, we're not going to see changes like that anymore
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  because it's becoming closer to...
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  they've gotten it down and they know what form factor it wants to be.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  And just look at the car industry.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.000]  Nobody... the new Porsche 911 comes out
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  and nobody who follows cars says,
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  oh my god, it looks just like last year's 911.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  It's ridiculous.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  And when somebody like BlackBerry did the BlackBerry Passport,
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  which was a big square phone,
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  and a bunch of people said,
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  oh, BlackBerry is willing to take risks, it looks different,
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  then nobody bought it and nobody used it
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  because we say we want these things but we don't.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  It's like why McDonald's is so popular.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  And the thing that's... Apple, of course,
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  they're working on phones that have a higher screen-to-casing ratio
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  and they'll ship them eventually,
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  but you read some of the articles
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  and they just delete the bezels and double-size the battery
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  and that's what Apple has to do to be a successful iPhone 7.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  And then you open up iFixit
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  and you show them all the technology in this phone
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  and you're like, what do you want them to do again?
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  Yeah, just cut off the bezels on the top and bottom.
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  Okay, but what about these parts of the phone?
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  Where are they going to go?
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  Are you chopping off all the battery that's in there
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  and all the sensors that are in there?
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  Are you going to compact them down,
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  just push them and hope that they somehow fit in anyway?
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  These aren't rational, well-thought-out arguments that are being made.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  They're sort of very emotional and very superficial.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  And I'm wondering how much we're going to have to put up with that, frankly,
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  because I'm not looking forward to September.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  I don't know either.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  And if the iPhone, I don't want to get lost in the woods on iPhone 7 speculation,
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  but if it's true, as widely leaked so far
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  by the things that have leaked out of the supply chain,
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  that the next iPhone, we keep calling it the 7.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  I don't know that they're going to call it the iPhone 7,
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  especially if it does look so similar to the iPhone 6 and 6s.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  But if it does largely look like the 6 and 6s,
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  it will be new because this will be the first time
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  I've stuck with a general form factor for three products three years in a row.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000]  So that is new territory.
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  But I really do think it's...
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:12.000]  Over every single year, every one of the S years so far,
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  I've seen people not trying to be jerks,
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  not trying to be clickbait,
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000]  just readers or just people on Twitter who say,
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  man, I don't think that they're going to sell a lot of these
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.000]  because it looks just like last year's.
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  But normal people don't buy a new iPhone every year.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  I just can't repeat that enough.
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  And I almost think that every two years is starting to become a stretch,
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:40.000]  that people just don't buy new $700 phones every two years.
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.000]  Yeah, and I went back and looked
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.000]  because I remember this Board Now narrative,
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.000]  and it was the iPhone 5.
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:51.000]  And the iPhone 5 rebuilt the iPhone from the Atom up.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.000]  It went to the bigger screen.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  It had the chamfered bay.
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.000]  Apple didn't have to.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:57.000]  They spent an awful lot of money basically rebuilding that entire phone,
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000]  and people said, oh, it's still a round-rect.
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000]  Yeah, new aspect ratio.
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000]  Yeah, boring, a round-rect.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.000]  I don't care about LTE.
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.000]  I don't care about the camera.
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000]  I don't care about the screen being 16 by 9.
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000]  I don't care about the chamfered edges.
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000]  It's still a round-rect fail.
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000]  I've heard this from so many people at Apple.
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:14.000]  It's absolutely institutionalized in the company's thinking
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:20.000]  is that they don't do new just for the sake of new.
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  The only reason they change something is if they're convinced that it's better.
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:30.000]  And that's why things like the MacBook slash PowerBook form factor
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  has been so incredibly stable since the titanium PowerBook,
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:37.000]  which was like, what, 2001 or something?
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:44.000]  I mean, it's very close to like the Porsche 911 of Apple
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:49.000]  is what does a pro laptop look like.
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.000]  I mean, if you took the titanium original,
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000]  which is the first one that went in this direction,
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  and compared it to today's MacBook Pro,
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.000]  you're going to be blown away by how thin and light the MacBook Pro is
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:08.000]  and how much better the unibody casing is than the titanium one in particular,
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:12.000]  where the seams really with wear and tear started to fall apart.
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:16.000]  It's better in so many ways, but year over year,
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  there was never like a radical, wow,
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:22.000]  they've totally changed the way the MacBook or PowerBook looks.
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.000]  Can you imagine reporters going, oh, another clamshell, boring.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  Right, exactly.
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:32.000]  It's very childish, the desire for radical new form factors,
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  because it's just not, unless you can do better.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000]  Yeah, and there's so many features that are better
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000]  that are actually worthy of our time and attention.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  It reminds me a bit of the smart battery case debacle from last December
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000]  where people reviewed it and they didn't ask any questions.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  They just did things like, oh, this is the capacity as listed.
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000]  Like, we found out the capacity of this battery
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:56.000]  and based on the price that other people charge for their batteries,
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000]  this is expensive.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.000]  Or, oh, we think it looks ugly because it has a hump.
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.000]  And nobody asked, like I asked immediately,
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000]  because the design was really different, is why did you do this?
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  And they were happy to answer,
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:10.000]  and I'm assuming they'd answer anybody on those questions.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  And it turns out it does things like not making your phone think
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  it's plugged into the wall so it doesn't turn on all the networking features
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  that it does when it believes it has unlimited power.
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  And it carefully goes around the antennas so that they don't get blocked,
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  because when the antennas are blocked, everything fires up
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000]  and has to use a lot more power to make a connection,
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  which defeats the purpose of having a battery case.
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000]  And they put the word smart in the name,
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.000]  but so much of the coverage was so incredibly superficial
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:40.000]  that it really embarrassed me as someone who works in the industry.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  And I just worry that we're getting more and more in that direction.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000]  I've seen people with those out and about, too.
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:48.000]  I've seen a fair, you know, because it's a fairly distinctive design,
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:52.000]  and you can, if somebody's walking and using their phone on the sidewalk,
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000]  it's, you know, the back of their phone is actually what you see.
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  And so I've definitely seen enough of them.
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000]  Because some of them on campus, I mean, they really like them.
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:02.000]  And these are not people who will suffer poor technology lightly.
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.000]  I'm still, I'm so surprised that they're only available in black and white.
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:09.000]  Like, I kind of wondered at the origin, you know,
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000]  like, hey, they're getting close to the holidays.
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000]  You know, I think it came out in November.
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000]  So I thought maybe that's why it's just black and white,
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.000]  because they, you know, wanted to make just, you know,
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.000]  two very, you know, you know, to match the front face of your phone.
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:24.000]  If you have a, you know, a gold iPhone or a silver one,
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.000]  you get the white case.
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000]  If you want it black, you can get black.
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000]  And that I just kind of thought that, like,
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000]  sort of like with the watch bands that they, you know,
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  maybe in a couple months there'd be more colors.
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  I'm sort of surprised that they're still just black and white.
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  Yeah, I thought that, too, about the smart keyboards for the iPads,
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  that, you know, the charcoal is fine,
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  but I thought that there would be at least one or two other options by now.
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  Yeah, I thought so, too.
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  Those are apparently incredibly hard to make.
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  Hmm, I did.
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000]  Which is why they've been shortages, yeah.
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  Hmm.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000]  All right, back to IO.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  Yes, sorry.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  Speaking of new phones, they didn't announce any new phones.
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  There was no word of a Nexus, new Nexus phone.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  And one of the reasons I'm curious about that is that
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  they announced all these other things that were coming later this year,
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.000]  you know, like Google Home.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  So even if the reason that they didn't do the new Nexus phone
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.000]  is that it's not ready yet,
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  well, that doesn't seem to have stopped them from announcing
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000]  all these other things that aren't ready yet.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  You know, why not just announce the phone that's coming in the fall?
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  So I'm curious of whether they're giving up on the Nexus phone thing now.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  Well, there was that rumor that they're going to switch from making Nexus phones
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  to making, I think, Project Silver or something,
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  which is going to be different.
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  And there's all these rumors that, you know, Google will one day,
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  like there's rumors that Microsoft will make a Surface phone.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  There's rumors that Google will make a Pixel phone
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  because the Nexus phones to date have not been manufactured by Google.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  They're manufactured by HTC or Samsung or I think it was LG,
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000]  and the most recent one, I think, is Huawei.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  And that's a very different thing because you're working with a partner
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:50.000]  and they're directing it a lot,
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000]  but, you know, they're working at the time schedule
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000]  of the original equipment manufacturer.
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.000]  So maybe whoever is making the next Nexus just doesn't have anything to show yet.
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  Yeah, I don't know. It's interesting to me.
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  One of the other things that I thought was pretty interesting, too,
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  is that the Android Instant Apps feature,
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  which is, you know, really, you know, a very impressive demo,
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  but it's going, when it ships, it's going to work back to Android KitKat,
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  which is, what are they on now, Marshmallow L, three versions ago.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  And it, to me, goes to show how what's most important in Android,
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  at least from Google's perspective,
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  and if you're a Google customer, a Google user,
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  is the Android Play runtime.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  What's that called?
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  Google Play.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  Google Play. The Google Play runtime.
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  Because Google can keep that up to date
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  and ship a change like supporting these Instant Apps
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  and not have to go through the phone carriers.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.000]  That's just the thing that updates through the Google Play app,
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  you know, just like your apps.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  So in the same way that you get app updates on Android
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  without going through the carrier process,
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  the Google Play updates the same way.
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  And so a lot of the, you know, 60% of all Android users
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  are using a two-year-old version of Android,
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:26.000]  sort of schadenfreude that iOS users look upon, you know,
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000]  Android as being inferior in that way.
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  It's really sort of not that important
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  because the parts that do get updated
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  is a lot of the user-facing parts.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  Yeah, I think there's a lot of truth to that.
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  I mean, there are situations where things like stage fright happen
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  where their inability to get carrier manufacturers
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  to push out updates in a timely fashion
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  is absolutely a user-facing issue
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  because your phone is just, no one really has exploited it,
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  but then, you know, those phones are open for an exploit,
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  and that's not a good thing,
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000]  whereas Apple can push out security updates to every phone
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  going back to 2011 all on the same day, every day, everywhere.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  Super impressive, but to me the interesting thing
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000]  is that we sort of went from these models
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  where Apple was very much a boutique.
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  Everything was completely locked down,
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  very curated and very limited, and Google was bizarre.
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.000]  Like, it was open-air market.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  You could sell or do anything you wanted,
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000]  and now, you know, slowly as Apple's beginning opener
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  with the technologies, Google has had to bring things in
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000]  and do things like app review
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  and do things like take away services from
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  the Android Open Source Project and put them,
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000]  or at least make more attractive versions of them
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:28.000]  available through Google Play services that they control.
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000]  So Apple's had to relax a little bit,
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  and Google's had to tighten up a little bit,
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000]  and we're getting sort of a much better experience
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  in the middle from both of them.
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:40.000]  Yeah. There was, they announced Android Wear 2.0.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000]  Yeah.
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:44.000]  Nothing really grabbed me in there,
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  and they added a keyboard, which I,
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:52.000]  I'm sorry, whoever I'm stealing this from,
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.000]  but somebody on Twitter last night quipped
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  that they still have a hard time entering
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.000]  their PIN code on an Apple Watch, you know,
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:03.000]  with just a zero to nine keyboard.
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.000]  I don't have a lot of faith in a full,
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:09.000]  QWERTY keyboard on a device this size.
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:13.000]  They say Google's pitch is that it's, you know,
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.000]  you're supposed to use it with the slide typing
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000]  and that their machine language will,
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:21.000]  their machine learning will, you know, be accurate,
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  but even during the demo, they got it wrong.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000]  I mean, like the iPhone is not as easy to type on
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000]  as the Mac, but we use it for things that are brief
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000]  and important that we don't want to have to go back
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.000]  to our Mac for, and the Apple Watch significantly,
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.000]  exponentially harder to interact with than an iPhone,
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  but you're supposed to use it again for briefer
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:43.000]  and even more important things.
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000]  You don't even have to pull your iPhone out for,
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000]  and it's just not clear to me,
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  and we're still really early days.
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000]  We haven't had a decade of phones and tablets
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  that, you know, we haven't had decade of watches
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  like we had phones and tablets
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000]  that what that interaction model should be,
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  but Android Wear 2.0 doesn't look like it,
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000]  it moves the needle in any direction significantly.
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000]  Yeah, and with this keyboard, I like, I'm not going to,
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  you know, it's a cardinal rule.
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000]  I'm not going to say it's a bad idea without having used it
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000]  because who knows, I could be surprised,
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  but I would certainly wager that it's a terrible idea.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  Well, you're not going to be writing
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.000]  during firewall post lines.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000]  I wouldn't write anything.
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:17.000]  I'm convinced that one thing that's true is for wearables,
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:21.000]  the only way to get text input is to dictate it.
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  The only good way.
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:27.000]  I just cannot believe that a full QWERTY keyboard on a watch,
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:30.000]  even if the watch is, you know, a big watch,
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000]  there's no way.
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000]  You need like that holographic Tony Stark keyboard
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  that makes a full size floating above your wrist
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  that you could type on.
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  I was trying to keep track.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.000]  I think every single person who came on stage at the event
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:45.000]  had a Google or an Android Wear watch on.
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  You have to be watch loyal, John. It's just part of the job.
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.000]  Well, I'm guessing that since the Apple watch has come out
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:53.000]  that there hasn't been a speaker in an Apple event
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000]  who's not wearing an Apple watch either.
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:58.000]  But to me, it's sort of, I don't know.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  There's something about that that rubs me the wrong way.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:03.000]  On both companies.
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000]  Yeah, I don't know if we talked about it on this show previously,
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:08.000]  but we were joking about are you going to have to be car loyal
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  because there's people at Apple that love their Porsches
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:13.000]  and their Ferraris and are they going to have to leave those at home
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  and drive the little Apple smart car around
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000]  and how happy will they be with that?
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  And they've got to do it in public the way they're not wearing
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  their Omegas or Panerais or Rolexes right now,
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000]  but they're wearing their Apple watches in public.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  Well, it's a damn good question. I don't know.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  Turn that Ferrari around, sir.
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:38.000]  Go back, get your Apple car, and then you can park here.
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  The last thing I have from my notes was they call it,
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  I don't know if it was the whole thing,
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:50.000]  but I think it's the Daydream, which is their mobile VR on Android phones,
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  and there's an API so that developers can start writing their own stuff,
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  and Google didn't announce any sort of hardware
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  they're actually going to sell,
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:02.000]  but they've made a quote-unquote reference design
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  for how to make a headset that you will put your phone in
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  and then make it your VR headset.
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:14.000]  They did Cardboard previously, which was a really low cost,
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  and there are versions of that that were sold in the Apple store, I think.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:20.000]  I forget what the name of that really popular kit, ViewMaster or something,
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  was making a version of that.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000]  All sorts of people did.
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:29.000]  I have a relative who works for Kellogg,
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:32.000]  and Kellogg even had, the cereal company,
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  even had a kit that you could put together to make your phone into...
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000]  A toy in the jack-in-box.
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  I don't know what to make of this.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  Is the phone going to be the future of VR?
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  I don't know.
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:56.000]  I do feel like the whole industry is moving in big trends across multiple companies.
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.000]  The voice-driven assistants, which we've talked about at length before,
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  and VR and or slash AR, augmented reality.
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  These things are obviously coming.
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  On the VR AR front, Apple has been publicly absolutely absent.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  There's no way that they're not working on stuff.
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  They have to be.
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  It's almost 100% certainty that internally they must be working on something.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:26.000]  But as typical for Apple, they're not going to talk about it
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000]  until they have a product ready to announce.
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  I don't know. This idea of the phone as the thing,
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  it kind of works because if you have VR goggles on,
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  you need a display in the goggles that's roughly about the size of a phone,
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:44.000]  and a phone isn't that heavy.
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  But is it the way to go?
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  Is it the way to go to slide into a pair of...
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  I don't know.
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  I think if you want to evangelize the technology,
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:58.000]  one of the problems with Google's previous AR attempts, the Google Glass,
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  is that it was really expensive, and you wore it out in public,
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  and it just wasn't a good social situation.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  And things like Oculus and the HTC Vive are these big elaborate headsets.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  You have to put on helmets, and you need a really powerful PC to run them.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  That's just not available to mainstream.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  This way, Samsung did it with the Samsung Galaxy Gear,
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  or just the Samsung Gear. I think it's Galaxy Gear anyway.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.000]  You put the phone on, and you put the goggles on, and you're doing it.
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  And that at least is accessible to anybody who has a phone
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:31.000]  and a few dollars extra for the case that holds it on your head.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  And I don't know if wearing something on your head is the end point for VR, AR,
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  or if it's just going to become a pervasive layer in our lives
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  that's projected on services around us.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:48.000]  But if you do want to get people into looking at VR displays,
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:51.000]  this is the cheapest way you can get it to as many people as possible,
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000]  and at least introduce the technology into our culture.
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:59.000]  I guess so, but do you think Apple would go down this route?
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.000]  No.
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000]  No. I don't either.
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:05.000]  I can't see Apple doing something like this.
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.000]  Although everybody's doing it, so maybe? I don't know.
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000]  I guess I wouldn't be shocked if they had that.
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:14.000]  But Apple AR, VR could be the HUD display in their car.
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000]  There's so many ways.
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000]  When you think about current display technology,
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000]  the display technology doesn't matter anymore.
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:24.000]  I have an OLED display on my wrist, and I have an LCD display in my hand,
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000]  but that's the last thing I really think about.
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000]  They're just ways of displaying information,
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:31.000]  and maybe Apple will figure that out for this as well.
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:34.000]  It's an interesting contrast with Oculus,
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:38.000]  because Oculus is sort of going the high-end route.
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:45.000]  To drive an Oculus, my understanding is you effectively need the power of a gaming PC.
[01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:49.000]  Yeah, absolutely, and famously they complained that a Mac won't drive it,
[01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:52.000]  at least not any standard Mac on the market will drive it.
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:55.000]  I preordered the Oculus. I haven't received it because it's been delayed.
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000]  My friend Georgia preordered the HTC Vive, and she hasn't got it yet
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000]  because it's been delayed either,
[01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:02.000]  but both of those require significant computer investments.
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:05.000]  You're easily talking over $1,000 to just get into the entry level of these things.
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:10.000]  Right. It's really high-end gaming PC-caliber graphics to drive it.
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:16.000]  From what I've seen, again, you really have to wear the goggles to really get the full effect,
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:21.000]  and Oculus is obviously producing much better graphics than what Google was showing with Daydream.
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000]  I was watching someone put on the Vive,
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.000]  and it looked almost like the first Iron Man movie where they were holding their heads up
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.000]  and things were going in their hands, and the thing was going on their head,
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:32.000]  and the cables were being tightened.
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:35.000]  Maybe PlayStation VR will be easier because people who have PlayStation won't be able to game it.
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:40.000]  Wait, you mean the Iron Man one where Tony Stark made it in the cave?
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:44.000]  Yeah, maybe. Maybe like that. That's probably it.
[01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:48.000]  They're not easy products. You've got to really commit your time to it.
[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.000]  I was joking when Facebook first bought Oculus
[01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.000]  that Facebook right now, they're in a browser window,
[01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000]  and you can just close a tab and you're gone,
[01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000]  or they're in an app and you can just switch apps and they're gone,
[01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:01.000]  but when Facebook is on your head, it takes a lot of commitment to get out of that.
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:05.000]  They just own that experience from then on.
[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:09.000]  Anything else from Google Iot? I think that more or less covers my notes.
[02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:12.000]  Yeah, they had a ton of sessions the way WWDC does,
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:15.000]  and I haven't had time to sort through much of what went on,
[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:18.000]  so I'm sure there's a bunch of very small and very, very interesting things that we haven't seen yet,
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:22.000]  but it wasn't to me like the razzle-dazzle Google Iot
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:25.000]  where Sir Guy is jumping off a plane like we saw in the early years,
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:31.000]  or I forget if it was Hugo Barrow or someone else who was just slamming Apple at every chance on stage.
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:36.000]  This to me was a very mature, very product-focused, very
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000]  Vic Gundotra is the guy.
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:41.000]  Vic Gundotra, that's right. Yeah, he was the one famously for doing it,
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:46.000]  but this was a very Sundar Pichai, I think, Google Iot, and I think it really benefited from that.
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:49.000]  I like the new Sundar Pichai Google.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000]  I do. I like it a lot more.
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:01:00.000]  It seems like all the crazy town stuff is all bundled up and shipped to Alphabet.
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000]  Yes.
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:08.000]  The Google Glass introduction, that might be peak Google I don't like,
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:14.000]  the peak of what I don't like about Google was entirely encapsulated by that,
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:21.000]  which was everything from Glass itself as a product idea, which I was absurd.
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.000]  It was terrible. It's just stupid.
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:30.000]  It is absolutely a terrible product, underpowered, ugly,
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:37.000]  on the worst part of your body for an ugly wearable, technically deficient.
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:44.000]  I've tried a pair. It's actually not thatit's low resolution, and it doesn't do anything.
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:49.000]  The fact that people thought that was going to be a product was just so goofy
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:52.000]  and says so much about the people who liked it.
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:57.000]  It's the wholewhat's his name? Robert, the guy who took it in the shower.
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000]  Yeah, Robert Scoville.
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:05.000]  Robert Scoville. Scoville said he doesn't foresee ever not wearing Google Glass ever again in his life.
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000]  Yeah.
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000]  The history is only obvious in hindsight.
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:16.000]  But combine that with the way that they introduced it with Serjay jumping out of a plane.
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:21.000]  Didn't Serjay do it? Serjay jumping out of a plane and landing on the roof of Moscone,
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:26.000]  everything about that just encapsulizes what I found ridiculous and absurd
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:32.000]  and hurt my eyes by rolling my eyes so hard about Google, and all of that seems gone.
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  And no, they didn't ship any of this stuff yet. Everything that they announced is coming later this year.
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:42.000]  But I have no doubt they're going to ship it, and it all seems to me like stuff that might be pretty popular.
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:47.000]  I think this Google Home seems like something that, depending on the price
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000]  and I don't think they announced the price. Do you know?
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:52.000]  No, I don't. At least not that I saw.
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:59.000]  I am going to assume it's going to be roughly Google Echo priced, or Amazon Echo priced.
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:07.000]  So let's say $150 to $200, something like that, or lower. I think they're going to sell a zillion of them.
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:13.000]  I can see Allo and Duo taking off and being successful.
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:16.000]  And I think Android N seems like a nice update to Android.
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000]  Absolutely, and almost everything except for Android N.
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:22.000]  I mean, they clearly said it's coming to iOS and Android, which means to me they've gotten their
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:25.000]  they sort of understand now that they're a services company,
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:29.000]  and if their end goal is to be the Star Trek computer, to be the machine learning, to be the AI,
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:33.000]  they need to reach as many people as possible, and they need that scale.
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000]  And as much as Android was an interesting way for them to hedge
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  and make sure they always had access to at least some form of device in people's hands,
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:43.000]  they are really being ubiquitous now with this technology.
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000]  And this to me is a cleaner, more focused Google.
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:50.000]  Did you see the thing where they added split screen to Android?
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:53.000]  I didn't see this version. I've seen various versions before.
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:57.000]  And including on the phone, which is interesting.
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:00.000]  Oh, that's right. I did see that, yeah.
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  I forget if it's a long tap or a double tap, but the standard three buttons now on Android
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:14.000]  are back button on the left, home button in the middle, and the multitasking button on the right.
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:21.000]  So if you tap the multitasking button, it puts your seven most recent apps in
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:24.000]  it's a lot like iOS, where you see that you just choose between these.
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:28.000]  It turns your apps into Windows, and you can scroll between them and switch.
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:35.000]  If you'd long tap on it now in Android N, it goes to split screen, multi-screen.
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:42.000]  And even on the phone, so it turns your phone into, like if you're holding it in a typical portrait,
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:45.000]  you get a square on top and a square on the bottom.
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:50.000]  So you kind of get two little, almost like Blackberry-sized screens.
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:51.000]  Yeah.
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:55.000]  And they also have picture-in-picture, which obviously is good for video.
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:05:01.000]  To be clear, that's obviously a catch-up feature to iOS.
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:05.000]  But on iOS, it's only an iPad feature. You can't do it on a phone.
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000]  So it's sort of a jump ahead there.
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:12.000]  I wonder whether Apple is thinking about picture-in-picture for iPhone.
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:18.000]  Well, on Android, at least to me, some Android phones are six inches and bigger.
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.000]  So for them, it's always been a continuum. The line between tablet and phone has been fuzzy.
[02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:25.000]  So they really have to make those things across a range of their devices.
[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:31.000]  I have to say, and it's one of those things where I'm not pushing for Apple to add a permanent button
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:35.000]  on the system like Android has for multitasking.
[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:39.000]  But I have to say that for the idea of split screen, I think it's a better interface.
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:44.000]  Because one of the things, too, is because they're soft buttons, it changes the icon of the button.
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:49.000]  It's just like a rectangle usually. And when you go to split screen, it's two rectangles on top of each other.
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:54.000]  And so it's very obvious how you get out of the mode. You just tap that button again and you get out of the mode.
[02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:59.000]  I don't like the way that the iPad does split screen.
[02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:07.000]  Because every time I use it, and I've been using the iPad Pro a lot more for doing things than I did on iPad before.
[02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000]  And I want to use the multitasking.
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:14.000]  But it seems so inconvenient to me that when I want to have two apps side by side, I have to slide the one over.
[02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:19.000]  And then tap the thing to change it from slide over to split screen.
[02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000]  It seems so fiddly.
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:26.000]  Yeah, and then there's different ways of switching the apps on either side and it's not a consistent experience yet.
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:31.000]  I really hope that Apple, I hope Apple is as dissatisfied with that as I am.
[02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:46.000]  That's like maybe my number one wish list for iPad for WWDC is for Apple to have given the idea of how we're going to do split screen multitasking a serious, serious redo design-wise.
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.000]  I don't think developers would have to do anything.
[02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:59.000]  If you're already on board with the size classes to support multitasking, if Apple switches the interface for how you get into and out of multitasking, it shouldn't be an issue for developers at all.
[02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:07.000]  Yeah, I still go back to if Apple Watch gets carousel and Apple TV gets headboard and whatever the other board is that I always forget the name for.
[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:18.000]  They get their distinct interface layers and iPad can easily get its own distinct interface layer that's better suited to the split screen, large screen world than just a straight port of the iPhone springboard is.
[02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:25.000]  Yeah, but split screen, not picture in picture, but split screen for the phone, I see that as a little bit of a gimmick.
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000]  I don't know how useful that would be.
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:37.000]  No, and then you start thinking maybe it would be useful in portrait like you said with two squares on top of it, but then you start having collision issues and where does the keyboard pop up and all these other things you have to start dealing with.
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:48.000]  Yeah, I kind of wanted to see that. They didn't show that. I guess it just slides the top app up off screen and if you're typing in the bottom app, it must just move it up to the top.
[02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:51.000]  And vice versa, yeah. That would be my hope at least.
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000]  Anything else?
[02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:57.000]  No, I think it was a good show. I'm eager to see what Apple does now at DubDub.
[02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:01.000]  Yeah, very interesting. It's going to be a fun run up. I'm looking forward to it.
[02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:13.000]  Rene, people can find you. Now, there's a new podcast you guys just started. I was actually the guest, so if you like hearing me and Rene talk, you should go listen to Apple Talk, which is a terrific name.
[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:33.000]  I cannot believe that that name hadn't been used for a podcast yet. You guys have switched your podcast methodology up. There's always been the iMore podcast. There still is the iMore podcast, but the iMore podcast is now sort of what you described.
[02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:45.000]  Yeah, it's more community focused and we do a lot of how-to stuff and question and answer and apps and accessories and things like that. And then the Apple Talk. And it's already called, well, I came up with the name. She's fantastic at naming those things.
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:56.000]  We had Michael Gartenberg join us, formerly of Apple. Michael Gartenberg joined us and we wanted to do more of a deep dive. And you were really gracious to come on the first episode and we spent the entire time talking about just the iPhone business.
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:09.000]  And the second episode was just on Apple Pay. And we're going to put up, I think later today, the third episode, which has Horace DeGio on it, and we're just talking about Apple Car. So it lets us really do sort of deeper dives than we were able to otherwise. I'm finding it really interesting so far.
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:26.000]  Yeah, it's a really great idea. And Michael Gartenberg, it's funny because he was at Apple for I think around four or five years. It was three, but yes, something like that. But it was like the three years where podcast has really taken off.
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:46.000]  And as we were recording the show, I was like, this guy is, I knew he's great. I mean, he's a smart guy and I've long been a fan of his writing. And I've met him a few times. But it's the first time I heard him on a podcast. And I thought, it's like a criminal shame that this man has not been on podcasts for the last three or four years because he's been at Apple.
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:54.000]  He's really, really good. He's really good at it. And it also was surprising to me that as a guy who hadn't been doing it for a while, he was already like a natural.
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:10:01.000]  I find a lot of people come out, especially people who've worked at Apple for a while, they're just so good at public speaking that it translates over the podcast well.
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:17.000]  Yeah. Well, the culture inside Apple is one of, I don't know, you didn't necessarily do a lot of public speaking, but it's a very, very, people who have good communication skills are drawn to Apple.
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:27.000]  It's a culture where you kind of need good communication skills to succeed. And so it's no surprise that people come out of Apple and have just never been on a podcast and are already good.
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:35.000]  Because it's a very verbal, go talk and express your ideas succinctly and clearly sort of company.
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000]  Good way of putting it.
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:47.000]  Everything or what else? They can find you on Twitter at Renee Richie. What else do you want to promote? What else do you got? You got the debug. You got so many podcasts.
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:57.000]  Yeah. I've cut down. I cut down a lot. So I only have a few right now, but we wanted to do this thing where instead of quantity, we really wanted to spend a lot more time and we're doing a lot more editing on them now.
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000]  And we want to make them as good as shows as we possibly can.
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:04.000]  Is there a point, is there like a webpage where they can find all these podcasts? Where should I tell people to go?
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:08.000]  iMore.com. We should have all of it. iMore.com slash podcasts.
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:14.000]  Alright. iMore.com slash podcasts and you can find out more. Renee, I thank you very much for your time.
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.000]  Thank you so much.
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  Always good to talk to you. I'll finish up here with a thanks to our sponsors. We had Warby Parker, the place where you get glasses, the Casper, the place where you buy a mattress, and Wealthfront, the place where you put your money if you're not stuffing it into your mattress.
