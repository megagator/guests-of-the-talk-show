[00:00.000 --> 00:04.680]  Well, not much has changed in the world since April of last year.
[00:04.680 --> 00:07.600]  Nothing at all.
[00:07.600 --> 00:12.000]  I think, I know, every time it comes up, I always say,
[00:12.000 --> 00:14.960]  yeah, it looks like it was April 30th, 2019.
[00:14.960 --> 00:20.040]  Every time Skype comes up on a podcast, it gets real meta real quick,
[00:20.040 --> 00:21.120]  and people complain.
[00:21.120 --> 00:23.520]  And I know people use other things, and who knows?
[00:23.520 --> 00:24.320]  Maybe I'll stop.
[00:24.320 --> 00:27.680]  Maybe I'll move on to something better.
[00:27.680 --> 00:33.240]  Ben and I use something called Zencastr for dithering,
[00:33.240 --> 00:38.720]  which is really weird but works really well, even when the things that
[00:38.720 --> 00:41.040]  are bad that could happen.
[00:41.040 --> 00:42.760]  Have you ever used Zencastr?
[00:42.760 --> 00:43.920]  Yeah, the web version, you mean?
[00:43.920 --> 00:46.040]  Yeah, so it's this web thing.
[00:46.040 --> 00:49.360]  You have to run it in Chrome or a Chrome browser.
[00:49.360 --> 00:50.360]  It doesn't work on Safari.
[00:53.240 --> 00:56.520]  And you start thinking weird things, like, well, wait a minute.
[00:56.520 --> 00:59.800]  If it's in a browser, couldn't you accidentally close the tab,
[00:59.800 --> 01:00.880]  and then you lose it?
[01:00.880 --> 01:04.000]  And I did that a couple days ago.
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.760]  And it's all pretty, it defends against it in pretty smart ways.
[01:08.760 --> 01:14.200]  I closed Chrome before everything was uploaded, and I just reopened it.
[01:14.200 --> 01:15.880]  And it was there.
[01:15.880 --> 01:21.000]  And it uses local storage to save a WAV file, and it was still there.
[01:21.000 --> 01:24.880]  But it's terrifying, because while that worked, like, oh my god,
[01:24.880 --> 01:27.840]  I shouldn't have closed that, reopen, there it is.
[01:27.840 --> 01:31.800]  On the other hand, like, Ben and I will go from, like,
[01:31.800 --> 01:33.680]  it always happens from Thursday to Sunday.
[01:33.680 --> 01:35.560]  Like, the biggest gap in our weekly schedule
[01:35.560 --> 01:39.760]  is that Thursday night we record for Friday morning,
[01:39.760 --> 01:42.400]  and then Sunday night we record for Monday morning.
[01:42.400 --> 01:45.800]  And when I come back on Sunday night after two nights off,
[01:45.800 --> 01:46.920]  it's all forgotten me.
[01:46.920 --> 01:50.880]  I'm not, you know, it might have my login, but it doesn't know anything.
[01:50.880 --> 01:53.600]  And I got to reload Chrome a couple times.
[01:53.600 --> 01:58.600]  And it's just not the way desktop apps work at all.
[01:58.600 --> 02:00.520]  Yeah, yeah, I agree.
[02:00.520 --> 02:05.200]  It's not, so I have recorded a number of podcasts using Zencastr,
[02:05.200 --> 02:09.320]  because it seems to be, for whatever reason, the preferred method by a lot of folks.
[02:09.320 --> 02:14.720]  I have lost an entire episode, which is obviously, you know, beyond frustrating.
[02:14.720 --> 02:16.600]  And the worst case scenario.
[02:16.600 --> 02:18.360]  Yeah, using it.
[02:18.360 --> 02:20.720]  I'm very surprised that they don't have a native app.
[02:20.720 --> 02:23.840]  You think, like, of all things, to all your points,
[02:23.840 --> 02:26.880]  this is something that probably should be a native app, so I'm surprised.
[02:26.880 --> 02:31.560]  I mean, obviously it's, you know, more involved and you have to do it for,
[02:31.560 --> 02:34.960]  then you'd have to do it for Mac, for Windows.
[02:34.960 --> 02:37.040]  But I'm pretty surprised that they don't do that.
[02:37.040 --> 02:39.720]  Yeah, and maybe it's on their list.
[02:39.720 --> 02:44.680]  You know, I should be the last one to complain about people not getting just stuff lower on their list.
[02:44.680 --> 02:49.520]  And maybe if they do an iOS app, then they can make it their Mac
[02:49.520 --> 02:52.640]  app by bringing it over with Catalyst.
[02:52.640 --> 02:57.960]  And, you know, it might be the perfect use of Catalyst,
[02:57.960 --> 03:02.760]  you know, like, in theory, if Zencastr is doing it, if they make an iPhone app,
[03:02.760 --> 03:06.480]  which you'd think they'd want to do, because it seems to me like, you know,
[03:06.480 --> 03:09.760]  people might want to use the computer that's with them everywhere.
[03:09.760 --> 03:13.360]  And the one that, you know, there's like a billion of them out there.
[03:13.360 --> 03:15.120]  Right.
[03:15.120 --> 03:18.160]  And it's not really at all.
[03:18.160 --> 03:21.440]  It's not like a professional editing tool, right?
[03:21.440 --> 03:25.920]  So it's like, I think that that's the sort of use case for Catalyst,
[03:25.920 --> 03:29.040]  where it could be really good for the Mac.
[03:29.040 --> 03:31.440]  Like, oh, well, we weren't going to do a Mac native app.
[03:31.440 --> 03:33.840]  But, you know, we have this iPhone one.
[03:33.840 --> 03:34.680]  Here it is.
[03:34.680 --> 03:38.000]  And it's better than running it in your browser.
[03:38.000 --> 03:39.480]  That really could be the case.
[03:39.480 --> 03:42.200]  But anyway, back to Scott.
[03:42.200 --> 03:44.080]  Yeah, I think that's right.
[03:44.080 --> 03:48.720]  Yeah, and, you know, I was an investor in Anchor, the podcasting startup that sold to Spotify.
[03:48.720 --> 03:52.240]  And they made a, you know, a native iOS and then iPad app.
[03:52.240 --> 03:53.640]  And the iPad app was actually great.
[03:53.640 --> 03:57.840]  And it seems like the perfect sort of tool for recording a podcast, right?
[03:57.840 --> 04:02.360]  Because to your point, it's sort of a computer you're more likely to have with you wherever you are.
[04:02.360 --> 04:08.560]  And it's certainly, obviously, way more than powerful enough to do this type of thing.
[04:08.560 --> 04:09.520]  But yeah, you're probably right.
[04:09.520 --> 04:17.120]  They might be holding off and going to do an iOS app and then port it over when catalyst stuff is working.
[04:17.120 --> 04:18.640]  Yeah, and a little bit more stable.
[04:18.640 --> 04:19.840]  Who knows?
[04:19.840 --> 04:20.480]  Yeah.
[04:20.480 --> 04:26.560]  But my thing with Skype is, and again, you know, you could set your clock by three, four times a year.
[04:26.560 --> 04:28.560]  At some point, I'm going to talk about it on my show.
[04:28.560 --> 04:36.480]  But the weirdest thing to me about Skype is that, and I use it literally three to four times a month, every month,
[04:36.480 --> 04:38.480]  because this is what I record my show on.
[04:38.480 --> 04:43.440]  And every once in a while, including today, I open it up, and it looks entirely different.
[04:43.440 --> 04:44.720]  And I don't know where anything is.
[04:44.720 --> 04:45.360]  Right.
[04:45.360 --> 04:51.440]  They add stories, they add, you know, whatever the thing de jour is to the social experience.
[04:51.440 --> 04:52.000]  It's ridiculous.
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  I opened it up today, and I haven't changed it.
[04:54.000 --> 04:57.760]  But the window looks like it's like a little iPhone-sized window.
[04:57.760 --> 05:01.280]  But you're there, and you know, it's working, so I'm going to let it go.
[05:01.280 --> 05:11.200]  But I have never used an app in all of my life that changes so completely every couple months,
[05:11.200 --> 05:18.000]  and just completely discombobulates my awareness of where everything in the app is and how to do stuff.
[05:20.400 --> 05:21.680]  But, you know, it sounds good.
[05:22.560 --> 05:23.520]  It does sound good.
[05:23.520 --> 05:25.760]  And what is, I mean, but what is Microsoft doing with it?
[05:25.760 --> 05:29.360]  Obviously, they're putting all their effort or a lot of their effort into the Teams product,
[05:29.360 --> 05:33.440]  which is, you know, a huge part of that is this exact use case, right?
[05:33.440 --> 05:37.600]  It's video conferencing, and obviously, audio is part of that.
[05:38.400 --> 05:40.560]  But they still have Skype in parallel.
[05:40.560 --> 05:42.640]  So, I mean, at some point, do they fold them together?
[05:43.200 --> 05:46.960]  And then you'll have to move over to Microsoft Teams or something to be able to do this?
[05:46.960 --> 05:48.240]  You would think so.
[05:48.240 --> 05:53.840]  I mean, and I know, we hashed over before, you know, we started talking like what topics
[05:53.840 --> 05:54.240]  to talk about.
[05:54.240 --> 05:57.840]  And I don't really want to go into the whole antitrust thing with the house.
[05:57.840 --> 06:02.880]  But in broad terms, without getting into the details of the report, there is a sort of
[06:02.880 --> 06:09.920]  sense of, like, without getting into the details, I feel like the higher level stuff is more
[06:09.920 --> 06:10.480]  interesting.
[06:10.480 --> 06:15.120]  And I kind of feel like if you read the prelude to their report, they're like, these companies
[06:15.120 --> 06:18.560]  have gotten really big and have made a lot of acquisitions.
[06:20.320 --> 06:22.400]  Something must be wrong, right?
[06:22.400 --> 06:23.840]  That's sort of their conclusion.
[06:23.840 --> 06:29.920]  And they're not so good at telling you exactly how this is wrong for the country or for consumers
[06:29.920 --> 06:34.160]  or for, you know, and they have specific cases of competitors, you know, who have complaints.
[06:34.160 --> 06:41.360]  But there is a sort of sense like, okay, Microsoft is so big that they own Skype, which they
[06:41.360 --> 06:46.880]  paid a fortune for and which has changed hands multiple times, like eBay, eBay paid a fortune
[06:46.880 --> 06:47.360]  for it.
[06:48.000 --> 06:48.640]  Right.
[06:48.640 --> 06:49.120]  It is.
[06:49.120 --> 06:51.680]  And spun it out and Andreessen was a big investor.
[06:51.680 --> 06:53.360]  And then they, yeah, right.
[06:53.360 --> 07:01.200]  It's like too big and too good to disappear, but also nobody seems to know what to do with
[07:01.200 --> 07:02.800]  it, right?
[07:02.800 --> 07:05.280]  Yeah, it still has brand mindshare, right?
[07:05.280 --> 07:09.200]  Like if you say Skype, most of the world, I think, would know what it is still.
[07:10.560 --> 07:14.720]  But right, it's no longer the go-to for what it was.
[07:14.720 --> 07:19.920]  And the technology is sort of, you know, it was very novel at the time, but now, you know,
[07:19.920 --> 07:25.360]  it's been sort of, I don't want to say eclipsed, but it's definitely sort of been sidetracked,
[07:25.920 --> 07:27.840]  sidelined by everything else.
[07:27.840 --> 07:29.760]  It's, I mean, it's old at this point.
[07:29.760 --> 07:30.320]  Yeah.
[07:30.320 --> 07:35.360]  And well, and let's face it, like, what is the app of 2020?
[07:35.360 --> 07:36.560]  It's got to be Zoom.
[07:36.560 --> 07:38.480]  I mean, TikTok, I guess, is on the list.
[07:38.480 --> 07:41.920]  Like if you're going to do, you know, all right, I don't even want to say that we have
[07:41.920 --> 07:43.360]  to pick one over the other.
[07:43.360 --> 07:50.160]  Let's just say we'll have just being nominated is an honor, right?
[07:50.160 --> 07:50.640]  Yeah.
[07:50.640 --> 08:01.600]  But like, TikTok, to me, isn't specific to the nature of 2020, whereas Zoom specifically
[08:01.600 --> 08:02.320]  is, right?
[08:02.320 --> 08:10.400]  Like the nature of being quarantined and having everything be remote, whether it's a school
[08:10.400 --> 08:15.040]  or meetings or just social stuff, right?
[08:15.040 --> 08:19.040]  Zoom cocktail hours, like, and Zoom is the thing that is sort of taken.
[08:19.040 --> 08:25.360]  And Skype is on the list of, well, wait, why wasn't Skype the thing that we're doing?
[08:25.360 --> 08:27.040]  Skype was there for years in advance.
[08:27.760 --> 08:28.480]  It's a good point.
[08:28.480 --> 08:32.960]  It's something I think about a lot on the, you know, in my current world of investing.
[08:32.960 --> 08:37.200]  It's basically, it boils down to this is, you know, just sort of the highest level thesis
[08:37.200 --> 08:39.680]  I have of things being in the right place at the right time, right?
[08:39.680 --> 08:41.120]  Because no ideas are really new.
[08:41.120 --> 08:42.320]  Everyone knows that.
[08:42.320 --> 08:48.400]  And things come up again and again and new, you know, it's just new takes on old ideas.
[08:48.400 --> 08:52.960]  And at some point, you know, something's in the right place at the right time for it to
[08:52.960 --> 08:53.200]  hit.
[08:53.200 --> 08:56.000]  And, you know, Skype was obviously, you know, massively popular.
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.800]  As you noted, it sold for many billions of dollars first to eBay, then to Microsoft later.
[09:00.800 --> 09:05.680]  So it's not like it wasn't a success, but you could argue had it existed, you know, now,
[09:05.680 --> 09:08.720]  10 years later or whatnot, it would have been a much bigger success.
[09:08.720 --> 09:10.240]  And that's what we're seeing with Zoom.
[09:10.240 --> 09:15.360]  And I think Zoom is, you're right that it's obviously benefiting from all the work from
[09:15.360 --> 09:16.560]  home and the COVID stuff.
[09:17.520 --> 09:21.520]  I think that was part of a trend that was, you know, happening all the remote work.
[09:21.520 --> 09:25.440]  Everyone knows that that was like, you know, slowly but surely sort of coming into focus.
[09:25.440 --> 09:29.760]  But this, I mean, the whole situation in the past six months now has accelerated it to
[09:29.760 --> 09:30.160]  the point.
[09:30.160 --> 09:33.760]  And Zoom was sitting right there in the perfect place to take advantage of it.
[09:33.760 --> 09:40.400]  Yeah, and that sort of, and I, you know, I've been a critic of several aspects of Zoom's,
[09:41.600 --> 09:46.240]  for lack of a better term, sloppiness in terms of the technical aspects of like, you know,
[09:46.240 --> 09:50.960]  the Mac app and how it was installed and what it left behind and the liberties its installer
[09:50.960 --> 09:51.200]  took.
[09:52.720 --> 10:00.720]  But on the other hand, I definitely appreciate the fact that it started with a very opinionated
[10:00.720 --> 10:02.000]  this should be easier.
[10:02.800 --> 10:03.200]  Yes.
[10:03.200 --> 10:05.440]  And you shouldn't have to complain.
[10:06.000 --> 10:07.440]  And what's easy?
[10:07.440 --> 10:12.400]  Okay, what if we just made, everybody who's invited gets a URL and when you click the
[10:12.400 --> 10:18.640]  URL, it either pops you right in because you're ready to go or you're literally about one
[10:18.640 --> 10:22.320]  or two more clicks from being there.
[10:23.760 --> 10:24.160]  Right.
[10:24.160 --> 10:25.520]  And they actually made it harder, right?
[10:25.520 --> 10:27.440]  Because of some of the security stuff you're alluding to.
[10:27.440 --> 10:28.720]  It's much harder than it used to be.
[10:28.720 --> 10:34.080]  So they sort of benefited from being small enough when they implemented that solution
[10:34.080 --> 10:38.080]  to not draw the eyes of both, you know, people who would take advantage of that
[10:38.080 --> 10:43.600]  nefariously, but also, you know, of the press and all that kind of stuff to know that, you
[10:43.600 --> 10:45.920]  know, there could be some downsides to that ease of use.
[10:46.560 --> 10:51.920]  And then once they, once that was sort of discovered, you know, they were able to move
[10:52.560 --> 10:56.640]  to fix it and it hasn't sort of sunk the company in a way that, you know, ruined the
[10:56.640 --> 10:57.680]  value proposition.
[10:57.680 --> 10:57.920]  Yeah.
[10:57.920 --> 11:07.760]  One way I try to think about, and I feel like part of it is a long-term cultural issue.
[11:07.760 --> 11:09.440]  And I think it's driven by the internet.
[11:09.440 --> 11:15.360]  And I think part of it is exacerbated by short tempers in 2020, which are natural, right?
[11:15.360 --> 11:21.200]  It is just natural that everybody is just had enough and our patience has worn thin
[11:21.920 --> 11:22.720]  across the board.
[11:22.720 --> 11:34.480]  But people, to me, are a lot less forgiving of mistakes across the board.
[11:34.480 --> 11:39.280]  And I'm really trying to be, it's one of those things, you know, I'm just trying to
[11:39.280 --> 11:41.200]  keep a consciousness about it.
[11:41.200 --> 11:45.120]  And me, you know, I don't want to be the one who doesn't forgive mistakes.
[11:46.320 --> 11:47.840]  And mistakes are inevitable.
[11:47.840 --> 11:48.880]  Everybody makes mistakes.
[11:48.880 --> 11:57.680]  I always say the way to be right all the time is to be smart enough and curious enough to
[11:57.680 --> 12:02.640]  be right most of the time, but also be aware that you're going to be wrong some of the
[12:02.640 --> 12:08.960]  time and be constantly open-minded about what you might be wrong about and figure it out
[12:08.960 --> 12:11.040]  and then say, oh, I was wrong about that.
[12:11.040 --> 12:11.920]  Here's the right.
[12:11.920 --> 12:13.600]  And correct yourself.
[12:13.600 --> 12:15.600]  And don't be embarrassed to say I was wrong.
[12:15.600 --> 12:18.720]  And definitely don't be embarrassed to say, I don't know.
[12:18.720 --> 12:18.960]  Right?
[12:18.960 --> 12:22.320]  The smartest people, I always say this, the smartest people I know are the people who
[12:22.320 --> 12:23.760]  are the most willing to say, I don't know.
[12:26.320 --> 12:27.440]  I think that's right.
[12:27.440 --> 12:32.400]  I think, you know, that's obviously top of mind in our political climate right now.
[12:32.400 --> 12:40.240]  But yeah, I mean, I view it as, I think that you're right that there seems to be more
[12:40.240 --> 12:45.840]  of a focus on things that are, I don't know, calling out things that are mistakes or what
[12:45.840 --> 12:46.480]  not.
[12:46.480 --> 12:51.040]  I think part of that is, you know, in our world, in the tech world, it's just, it's
[12:51.040 --> 12:53.360]  now fully mainstream, right?
[12:53.360 --> 12:57.600]  It obviously has been for a while, but it's now, it's so integrated in everyone's lives,
[12:57.600 --> 13:02.880]  especially in work from home, as we were just talking about, we rely on these things so
[13:02.880 --> 13:08.800]  much that any little mistake like, you know, Slack went down yesterday or the day before,
[13:08.800 --> 13:11.120]  and it's like, you know, the internet is up in arms about it.
[13:11.120 --> 13:11.680]  And why?
[13:11.680 --> 13:15.280]  Because everyone's using it to do their business.
[13:15.280 --> 13:19.440]  And when it goes, when something like that goes down, it's not just that it's like a
[13:19.440 --> 13:21.440]  nice to have even like Twitter, right?
[13:21.440 --> 13:25.120]  It's not just like, Twitter's become an information flow for people.
[13:25.120 --> 13:28.960]  Like how do we know what the, if Twitter goes down and the president is trying to tweet
[13:28.960 --> 13:33.360]  that he's about to attack a country, like that is real now ramifications.
[13:34.880 --> 13:41.040]  Imagine if, imagine if for the next four weeks, Twitter had the uptime that it had circa,
[13:41.040 --> 13:41.840]  let's say 2009.
[13:41.840 --> 13:43.040]  Oh my God.
[13:43.040 --> 13:44.160]  Remember the fail whale?
[13:44.160 --> 13:45.280]  Oh, I don't know.
[13:45.280 --> 13:46.880]  I mean, yes, of course.
[13:46.880 --> 13:50.480]  I, you know, I was, I was as guilty as anyone as for writing about that every single time
[13:50.480 --> 13:52.480]  it went down back in the day.
[13:52.480 --> 13:54.400]  I don't know what they would like, what would they do?
[13:54.400 --> 13:58.080]  Would the government have to step in to take over control of Twitter to make sure?
[13:58.080 --> 14:00.880]  How would we know what the president has to say?
[14:00.880 --> 14:01.520]  I don't know.
[14:01.520 --> 14:02.960]  They have to nationalize Twitter.
[14:02.960 --> 14:03.520]  I don't know.
[14:04.480 --> 14:05.040]  I don't know.
[14:05.040 --> 14:12.160]  But my, my take on mistakes and Zoom and trying to be forgiving is that if you assume that
[14:12.160 --> 14:16.560]  everybody is always going to make mistakes and nothing's ever going to be perfect, a
[14:16.560 --> 14:22.480]  lot of times you have to decide which way you're going to approach the perfect ideal.
[14:23.360 --> 14:31.040]  And for this sort of remote video collaboration, Zoom approached it from the side of being
[14:31.040 --> 14:32.880]  as easy to use as possible.
[14:32.880 --> 14:39.680]  And so their mistakes were things like, we'll just have these URLs with a string that's
[14:39.680 --> 14:42.400]  string that's randomized and that's how you get in.
[14:42.400 --> 14:47.600]  And if you know that you're in and it made Zoom bombing possible because attackers could
[14:47.600 --> 14:54.960]  just start guessing, you know, the, the, the, you know, within the pattern of what a Zoom
[14:54.960 --> 14:59.600]  URL might be, just keep trying them all until you find one and then jump in and there you
[14:59.600 --> 14:59.760]  are.
[15:01.760 --> 15:03.520]  And, you know, it was a mistake.
[15:03.520 --> 15:04.080]  They fixed it.
[15:04.080 --> 15:07.360]  I mean, one thing they have is they, you know, they had their, I hope that was bad.
[15:07.360 --> 15:09.280]  We'll fix it, you know, and there you go.
[15:09.280 --> 15:10.160]  They're, they're out.
[15:10.160 --> 15:15.040]  And, and it's, I think the popularity of Zoom is that they're approaching it from that
[15:15.040 --> 15:18.640]  side and it's so easy to get in.
[15:18.640 --> 15:22.480]  And I, you know, we, we can, nobody's got a good solution to any of this.
[15:22.480 --> 15:28.480]  And, but it's no surprise that it's the best one or the most popular one.
[15:28.480 --> 15:30.880]  It's the one that we've sort of turned into a verb.
[15:30.880 --> 15:33.680]  I mean, it went from a product to a verb so fast.
[15:33.680 --> 15:39.360]  I don't know that anything that's, that's gone that fast to, to verbified.
[15:41.040 --> 15:42.000]  I think that's right.
[15:42.720 --> 15:44.480]  I also am curious of your thoughts.
[15:44.480 --> 15:47.600]  I, I haven't thought about this in a while, but this was something I think I read about
[15:47.600 --> 15:51.200]  it, I don't know, maybe six months ago or so, probably around the time that quarantine
[15:51.200 --> 15:57.840]  started, because to your point, you know, we were all getting this, this type of solution
[15:57.840 --> 16:01.760]  we needed all of a sudden, even if we didn't realize it at first.
[16:01.760 --> 16:06.640]  And it's, it's sort of fascinating to me that Apple has had FaceTime for many years
[16:06.640 --> 16:07.840]  now, and it's a great product.
[16:07.840 --> 16:12.960]  Everyone would say it's, it's a, it's really fantastic, easy to use, great quality.
[16:14.640 --> 16:19.760]  But they didn't, they were never able to connect it in a way for this type of use case,
[16:19.760 --> 16:20.160]  right?
[16:20.160 --> 16:22.480]  Like, you know, you connect to your family, sure.
[16:22.480 --> 16:26.080]  And I'm sure the use case, the usage is up immensely because of that.
[16:26.080 --> 16:29.120]  I use it to talk to, to my family on a regular basis.
[16:29.120 --> 16:32.320]  But there's not like the use case of work, certainly.
[16:32.320 --> 16:35.200]  And you know, that's not Apple's focus, so it's hard to ding them for that.
[16:35.200 --> 16:39.600]  But I think it does seem like, especially in the era of services and everything that's
[16:39.600 --> 16:45.280]  going on with Apple, there was a real opportunity there to sort of own this space, because to
[16:45.280 --> 16:48.240]  your point, they are, you know, famous for the ease of use.
[16:48.240 --> 16:51.280]  And I think that they could have probably done it even better than Zoom has done it,
[16:51.280 --> 16:55.040]  if they made like a, I don't want to say an enterprise-grade version of it necessarily,
[16:55.040 --> 16:56.720]  but certainly one for the living room, right?
[16:56.720 --> 17:01.040]  Like if you imagine what they could have done with using either Apple TV or the HomePod
[17:02.000 --> 17:07.520]  or a new product and just made it like the perfect device, sort of like what Facebook
[17:07.520 --> 17:11.840]  randomly, oddly did with the portal, which I haven't used myself.
[17:11.840 --> 17:14.640]  I know a lot of people who have it and actually love it.
[17:15.760 --> 17:19.680]  I made a lot of fun of it when it first came out because it came out in the middle of probably
[17:19.680 --> 17:23.040]  the worst possible time for a product like that to come out when Facebook was in the
[17:23.040 --> 17:25.120]  middle of the Cambridge Analytica stuff.
[17:25.120 --> 17:31.120]  You know, like, okay, so Facebook is going to launch a connected camera, you know, from
[17:31.120 --> 17:33.360]  a company that you don't necessarily trust with your data.
[17:33.360 --> 17:35.040]  That sounds like the worst idea in the world.
[17:35.040 --> 17:37.200]  Like at least postpone this thing six months.
[17:37.200 --> 17:39.120]  But now it's in a perfect position, right?
[17:39.120 --> 17:40.880]  And why does an Apple have a product like that?
[17:41.760 --> 17:42.960]  Yeah, I wonder.
[17:42.960 --> 17:49.040]  And with the group chat feature that they added in particular, I forget, probably multiple
[17:49.040 --> 17:55.760]  people observe this, but it almost feels in hindsight after people actually tried using
[17:55.760 --> 18:01.040]  it that it's really felt built for demoing.
[18:01.680 --> 18:09.760]  Like the best case scenario for FaceTime group chat was the on stage demo when Apple showed
[18:09.760 --> 18:10.160]  it.
[18:10.160 --> 18:11.440]  And it looks cool.
[18:12.320 --> 18:18.320]  But in practice, there's a lot of aspects of it that just aren't that, it just isn't
[18:18.320 --> 18:19.040]  cut out for it.
[18:19.040 --> 18:23.760]  And that's even if you just accept the baseline, it only works on Apple products, right?
[18:23.760 --> 18:29.040]  Like if you even just accept the fact that that's who it's for, and you have to have
[18:29.040 --> 18:32.480]  one and therefore, you know, it can't be used for school or something like that, where they
[18:32.480 --> 18:35.600]  can't say you have to have a device from this one company.
[18:37.280 --> 18:39.200]  But even there, it just isn't that great.
[18:39.200 --> 18:45.680]  And I, you know, it's, it is the case that, you know, all of these remote briefings and
[18:45.680 --> 18:49.440]  stuff that Apple's had over the last six, you know, in the whole COVID era, they do
[18:49.440 --> 18:55.360]  over WebEx, which is amazing Cisco product, like an old school Cisco product.
[18:55.360 --> 18:55.520]  Yeah.
[18:56.320 --> 19:03.040]  And I don't blame them, but it's just because, you know, there's features in the WebEx that
[19:03.040 --> 19:07.280]  just aren't possible in FaceTime, you know, there's, and part of it, you know, they're
[19:07.280 --> 19:14.160]  not great and interface wise, but there's ways for like people who at Apple who are
[19:14.160 --> 19:21.440]  in PR, who aren't on the call to be, who aren't talking on the call, but want to be,
[19:21.440 --> 19:25.760]  you know, sort of like, if it was the real world, they'd be in the room, but they're
[19:25.760 --> 19:29.840]  not participating, you know, you can be in the room and not participate.
[19:29.840 --> 19:34.400]  And in a way that FaceTime doesn't really make possible other than having their face
[19:34.400 --> 19:38.080]  there, you know, and adding, you know, you can't be in that state.
[19:38.080 --> 19:42.960]  There's other features too, but it just sticks out to me though, that they're using
[19:42.960 --> 19:46.720]  that instead of their own product when their own product is in this sphere.
[19:46.720 --> 19:47.200]  I don't know.
[19:47.200 --> 19:48.000]  Yeah.
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.240]  It's, I think you're right.
[19:50.240 --> 19:54.960]  I think there's a utilitarian aspect to sort of the certainly WebEx, but also to
[19:54.960 --> 19:55.600]  Zoom, right?
[19:55.600 --> 19:59.840]  Where Apple just doesn't fill that use case well right now.
[19:59.840 --> 20:05.600]  And as you're noting, like the multi-person thing is more, it's more like cute, right?
[20:05.600 --> 20:08.720]  It's more of a cute UI that they're trying to do and less utilitarian.
[20:08.720 --> 20:12.320]  So it'd be sort of frustrating, I imagine, to use it for a lot of these use cases.
[20:12.320 --> 20:12.720]  Yeah.
[20:12.720 --> 20:17.440]  But it does remind me of, it's like when the Apple stores, before they were using the
[20:17.440 --> 20:20.160]  iPhone to actually do payments, right?
[20:20.160 --> 20:24.480]  Like, so they had, you know, they had a mechanism to do it with Square, certainly.
[20:24.480 --> 20:26.880]  But, you know, a number of different ways.
[20:27.600 --> 20:33.920]  PayPal had a version at one point, but they were still using an old school POS system,
[20:33.920 --> 20:34.560]  right?
[20:34.560 --> 20:37.280]  Up until, I think, what, last year or something like that.
[20:37.280 --> 20:40.480]  They use them now and they have this sort of, I don't even know who makes it.
[20:40.480 --> 20:42.720]  I'm sure you've seen it, though, you know, the one where you can do Apple Pay.
[20:42.720 --> 20:45.360]  It sort of like snaps off the back of an iPhone, I think.
[20:45.360 --> 20:46.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[20:46.720 --> 20:47.360]  It's weird.
[20:47.360 --> 20:53.280]  It's like related to the iPhone, but isn't just an iPhone, you know?
[20:53.280 --> 20:54.560]  Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.
[20:55.360 --> 20:58.800]  But it's sort of like that, how they, you know, they have sort of solutions they could
[20:58.800 --> 21:03.920]  use and they eventually get there, but yeah, not right out of the gate.
[21:05.040 --> 21:07.920]  I remember, and I don't do this to be a jerk.
[21:07.920 --> 21:12.880]  I just, and I, in hindsight, as soon as I did it, I was like, I should not have done
[21:12.880 --> 21:13.040]  this.
[21:13.040 --> 21:15.200]  This was a mistake because it's just not me.
[21:15.200 --> 21:19.440]  But it must have been like five years ago or six years ago when the first Apple Watch
[21:19.440 --> 21:22.400]  came out and it had Apple Pay right from the beginning.
[21:23.040 --> 21:28.320]  And I had a review unit before they, you know, were in customer hands.
[21:28.320 --> 21:30.640]  And I wanted to try, I didn't know where to try Apple Pay.
[21:30.640 --> 21:32.480]  So I went to the Apple store to buy something.
[21:32.480 --> 21:37.760]  And I would choose, and I forget what I bought.
[21:37.760 --> 21:40.560]  Something, you know, I don't know, something I needed like a cable or something that I
[21:40.560 --> 21:42.800]  could use, but you know, it's like 30 bucks.
[21:42.800 --> 21:43.440]  How do you want to pay?
[21:43.440 --> 21:44.480]  I want to pay Apple Pay.
[21:44.480 --> 21:48.240]  And she held the thing out and I took out my watch and they didn't even have watches
[21:48.240 --> 21:49.200]  for sale yet.
[21:49.200 --> 21:50.640]  And she was like, whoa.
[21:50.640 --> 21:53.280]  And I'm like, oh no, please, let's keep this on the down low.
[21:53.280 --> 21:54.640]  She's like, how do you have that?
[21:54.640 --> 21:56.800]  And I'm like, oh no, I just wanted to see how it works.
[21:57.680 --> 22:02.160]  And I was like, I really wanted to just drop the product and just run out of the store
[22:02.160 --> 22:04.560]  and just be like, oh no, this is a terrible mistake.
[22:05.440 --> 22:05.600]  Yeah.
[22:05.600 --> 22:06.800]  It's like that.
[22:06.800 --> 22:10.560]  Remember the, you'll remember back in the day when Steve Jobs would use the iPhone,
[22:10.560 --> 22:14.800]  like at a baseball game, just like, yeah, yeah, it's no big deal, whatever.
[22:16.640 --> 22:16.800]  Right.
[22:16.800 --> 22:19.040]  He was like his kid's soccer gamer, whatever.
[22:19.040 --> 22:23.040]  And just standing by the fence, like, you know, all of a sudden, you know, it's like,
[22:23.600 --> 22:24.880]  you know, he's like a real person too.
[22:24.880 --> 22:29.520]  He's just a dad at a soccer game and he's got an iPhone and they're not out yet.
[22:29.520 --> 22:30.160]  Right.
[22:30.160 --> 22:34.000]  He has this thing that's about to change the world in many ways, but you know, whatever.
[22:34.000 --> 22:34.320]  Yeah.
[22:34.320 --> 22:42.720]  Predicting every single parent at a soccer game for the next decades of civilization.
[22:43.920 --> 22:44.160]  All right.
[22:44.160 --> 22:46.400]  Let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor.
[22:46.400 --> 22:47.520]  Oh, it's a new sponsor.
[22:47.520 --> 22:48.160]  Really excited.
[22:49.040 --> 22:50.640]  Nest Payroll.
[22:51.520 --> 22:55.760]  How many of you are trying to balance working from home and caring for kids or maybe an
[22:55.760 --> 23:01.120]  aging parent? Have you hired a regular babysitter, a nanny or a caregiver to help you?
[23:01.760 --> 23:07.040]  If you're paying over $2,200 a year, which is really just 43 bucks a week,
[23:07.600 --> 23:11.280]  it is actually the law that you have to pay above the board.
[23:11.280 --> 23:16.080]  Many people think nannies, caregivers, or that learning supervisor that you just hired
[23:16.080 --> 23:17.840]  are independent contractors.
[23:17.840 --> 23:22.960]  They are actually your employee, even if they only work part time or for multiple families.
[23:22.960 --> 23:27.040]  And the IRS is really clear that you are required to withhold and pay employer taxes.
[23:27.040 --> 23:28.080]  Oh, what a pain.
[23:28.080 --> 23:29.760]  That sounds complicated and hard to do.
[23:29.760 --> 23:32.800]  And that is where Nest Payroll comes in.
[23:32.800 --> 23:37.120]  They believe that you deserve an easy way to do this all legally and above the board.
[23:37.840 --> 23:39.520]  And so they created Nest Payroll.
[23:39.520 --> 23:41.440]  It's a native iOS app for your iPhone.
[23:41.440 --> 23:42.960]  It works on your iPad too.
[23:42.960 --> 23:47.920]  Takes care of all of the work while making payday a cinch.
[23:47.920 --> 23:49.200]  Five minutes of setup.
[23:49.200 --> 23:51.920]  You get walked through three easy steps to get you going.
[23:51.920 --> 23:55.360]  You add your employees, take seconds to pay them each week.
[23:55.360 --> 23:58.880]  Professional pay stubs are automatically emailed to your employee,
[23:58.880 --> 24:03.040]  employees, and all the tax work is completed behind the scenes.
[24:03.040 --> 24:06.960]  So you don't do anything that includes setting up your accounts with the state,
[24:06.960 --> 24:11.840]  federal reporting, filing each quarter, W-2s at the end of the year,
[24:11.840 --> 24:16.720]  and a signature ready schedule age that goes with your taxes each April.
[24:16.720 --> 24:18.080]  All of it taken care of.
[24:18.080 --> 24:22.240]  It's as easy as paying them below the board, but paying them above the board.
[24:22.240 --> 24:23.600]  It benefits everybody.
[24:23.600 --> 24:26.480]  Your employees receive the safety net of unemployment insurance,
[24:26.480 --> 24:28.400]  Social Security, Medicare.
[24:28.400 --> 24:30.800]  It's good for them and it is good for you.
[24:30.800 --> 24:33.040]  Just peace of mind alone.
[24:34.320 --> 24:35.520]  You might think it's more expensive.
[24:35.520 --> 24:37.360]  You're like, ah, well, what about the cost?
[24:37.360 --> 24:42.960]  It's really only about 10% more to pay officially and report everything
[24:42.960 --> 24:44.560]  than it is to pay below the board.
[24:44.560 --> 24:49.040]  10%, that is the peace of mind alone is worth it.
[24:49.040 --> 24:52.000]  It's just 34 bucks a month to use Nest Payroll,
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.040]  and it is the easiest way to pay your household employees legally.
[24:55.040 --> 24:56.000]  So you're above the board.
[24:56.880 --> 25:00.080]  Just take out your phone, pay them in seconds with confidence,
[25:00.080 --> 25:01.440]  and know that you're doing the right thing.
[25:02.080 --> 25:05.360]  Go to nestpayroll.com.

[25:27.920 --> 25:30.560]  Hey, before we get into upcoming stuff,
[25:30.560 --> 25:32.800]  you had a good piece on Apple Watch 6,
[25:34.400 --> 25:36.640]  which I didn't even notice before I invited you on the show,
[25:36.640 --> 25:38.720]  but I thought you had a good take on it.
[25:39.840 --> 25:45.680]  In particular, that you switched from the graphite steel to the blue aluminum,
[25:46.960 --> 25:53.680]  which I still haven't seen in person because where do you go to see watches?
[25:55.680 --> 26:00.880]  But the photos of which I really like and your photos too,
[26:00.880 --> 26:04.400]  just you shooting photos of the watch in your hand,
[26:04.400 --> 26:08.720]  it's like, man, this blue aluminum looks really cool.
[26:09.840 --> 26:10.800]  I think it does look great.
[26:14.640 --> 26:18.000]  Because I read your review, I think I have the same one that you did.
[26:18.640 --> 26:20.720]  I had the graphite stainless steel.
[26:20.720 --> 26:21.280]  That's the one you have.
[26:21.280 --> 26:22.400]  Yeah, that's the one Apple sent me.
[26:24.080 --> 26:26.880]  And so I ordered that one at first,
[26:26.880 --> 26:30.320]  mainly honestly because that was the one that would sort of get here the fastest
[26:31.200 --> 26:33.280]  of all the shipping times.
[26:33.280 --> 26:34.880]  But I was interested in that one too,
[26:34.880 --> 26:39.200]  sort of a new take on the color that they've done for a long time.
[26:39.200 --> 26:44.960]  But then I was a little bit curious about the blue one
[26:45.840 --> 26:48.480]  because I just sort of thought I would like that color.
[26:48.480 --> 26:52.640]  And so I was able to get one that shipped I think two weeks or so later.
[26:52.640 --> 26:55.680]  And I was glad that I did because to your point,
[26:55.680 --> 26:57.680]  I do think it looks great.
[26:57.680 --> 26:58.640]  I mean, I'm wearing it right now.
[26:58.640 --> 27:05.600]  It looks like, as I put in there, it's not blue blue.
[27:05.600 --> 27:09.520]  It's sort of darker cobalt is how I sort of described it.
[27:09.520 --> 27:11.200]  And then like a lighter navy.
[27:11.200 --> 27:13.840]  It's like in between those, but it looks really good.
[27:14.480 --> 27:18.000]  And I do hope that the rumor of an iPhone in this color,
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.640]  sort of replacing the hunter green or whatever they called it for the last one.
[27:22.640 --> 27:25.440]  I hope that they do one in this color because I think it's great.
[27:25.440 --> 27:27.760]  It's a little weird having a colorful one, right?
[27:27.760 --> 27:30.720]  Because obviously some of the bands it will clash with.
[27:31.840 --> 27:35.680]  But I think blue is a nice sort of elegant solution to it.
[27:35.680 --> 27:40.240]  Red would be a little bit in your face, but I like the blue one a lot.
[27:40.240 --> 27:42.640]  Yeah, red is probably not for me and you.
[27:42.640 --> 27:45.440]  We're not really in your face, but I could see why it might be popular.
[27:45.440 --> 27:48.240]  And that's another color I'm really interested to see
[27:48.240 --> 27:54.080]  because it's so different from the watches they've made to date.
[27:54.080 --> 27:59.680]  And I, again, I don't like to do what I'm about to do,
[27:59.680 --> 28:06.880]  except that I actually do like it, but which is speculate on executives
[28:06.880 --> 28:09.440]  who are no longer with the company and how things are different,
[28:09.440 --> 28:14.320]  which is to me, some, maybe some of the Johnny I've influence.
[28:14.320 --> 28:24.000]  And I, I couldn't help but feel all along from the get-go that the Johnny I've influence.
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.920]  The Johnny I've, part of the Johnny I've influence on the Apple watch
[28:28.720 --> 28:38.240]  was too informed and unrestrained by his affinity and deep appreciation
[28:38.240 --> 28:40.000]  for the traditional watch industry.
[28:40.000 --> 28:45.040]  Johnny I've is a long-standing app or regular watch person.
[28:45.840 --> 28:49.600]  Luxury watches has, you know, like we're an investor in a Houdenki,
[28:49.600 --> 28:56.560]  which is one of the preeminent sort of high-end watch destinations.
[28:56.560 --> 28:59.840]  And he's done interviews with them and just goes on and on
[28:59.840 --> 29:02.560]  about how much he loves his luxury watches.
[29:02.560 --> 29:03.760]  And I think you're right.
[29:03.760 --> 29:11.360]  Like you're basically suggesting that there was a reason that they did the gold one,
[29:11.360 --> 29:15.120]  the edition ones, was obviously driven by him.
[29:15.120 --> 29:17.120]  And now the fact that he's no longer there,
[29:17.120 --> 29:20.320]  is that why we're now seeing, you know, a range of colors?
[29:20.320 --> 29:21.040]  Yeah.
[29:21.040 --> 29:26.160]  And you know, and you're being, you're being too humble.
[29:26.160 --> 29:29.840]  Houdenki is the premier site for stuff like that.
[29:29.840 --> 29:30.800]  And I love it.
[29:30.800 --> 29:34.880]  And I've known Ben Clymer, founder of Houdenki for a while.
[29:34.880 --> 29:35.600]  It's a great site.
[29:36.720 --> 29:38.720]  But yeah, I'll put that in the show notes.
[29:38.720 --> 29:40.080]  I swear to God, I'm adding it right now.
[29:40.080 --> 29:45.040]  But the Houdenki profile of Johnny I've was terrific.
[29:45.040 --> 29:49.040]  Really, really terrific.
[29:49.040 --> 29:54.640]  But I feel like the gold thing is ridiculous in hindsight.
[29:54.640 --> 29:56.720]  It was just ridiculous when it happened.
[29:56.720 --> 29:59.840]  And it doesn't get any less ridiculous in hindsight
[29:59.840 --> 30:05.040]  that Apple was selling $20,000 solid gold watches,
[30:06.640 --> 30:11.680]  the internals of which were technology that lasted a year.
[30:11.680 --> 30:15.280]  You know, and it was so technologically that the,
[30:15.280 --> 30:17.600]  you know, what we now call in hindsight, the series zero,
[30:18.160 --> 30:21.760]  that they didn't, when they came out with the series two,
[30:22.800 --> 30:24.960]  they couldn't keep selling.
[30:24.960 --> 30:26.480]  You know, this is Apple's pattern, right?
[30:26.480 --> 30:27.280]  We saw it again.
[30:27.280 --> 30:28.960]  You know, we see it now where they're still selling
[30:28.960 --> 30:34.160]  the series three watches for $199 is that the last 10 years
[30:34.160 --> 30:37.040]  of Apple as they've gotten bigger, the way that they've
[30:37.040 --> 30:40.800]  gotten more democratic and lowered their price points
[30:40.800 --> 30:46.640]  across the board is by selling older products at lower prices.
[30:48.400 --> 30:50.000]  And it's really worked well for them.
[30:50.720 --> 30:53.680]  And the times where they've tried to introduce new products
[30:53.680 --> 30:55.760]  at a lower price, like the iPhone 5C,
[30:56.320 --> 30:58.080]  it hasn't worked so well.
[30:58.080 --> 31:00.960]  And I almost feel like maybe they gave up on it too soon.
[31:00.960 --> 31:03.760]  I still think the iPhone 5C is one of the most
[31:03.760 --> 31:05.760]  best looking iPhones Apple ever made.
[31:05.760 --> 31:06.400]  I agree.
[31:06.400 --> 31:09.440]  I got one, even though it wasn't my primary phone.
[31:09.440 --> 31:12.240]  And I got one just to see what it would look like.
[31:12.240 --> 31:15.200]  This is back when I was still reviewing tech products
[31:15.200 --> 31:16.160]  for a living and stuff.
[31:16.160 --> 31:17.680]  And it was a beautiful device.
[31:17.680 --> 31:20.000]  I think I still have it in a drawer somewhere, a blue one.
[31:20.000 --> 31:21.040]  It was great looking.
[31:21.040 --> 31:22.400]  Yeah, it really was.
[31:22.400 --> 31:25.680]  But it didn't set the world on fire marketing wise.
[31:25.680 --> 31:29.680]  And I feel like, or sales wise, and I feel like the lesson
[31:29.680 --> 31:34.160]  Apple internalized from that was that what works is taking
[31:34.160 --> 31:38.720]  former top of the line products and then a year, two years,
[31:38.720 --> 31:40.960]  three years later, selling them at lower price points.
[31:40.960 --> 31:46.560]  So that even if you're buying the $199 Series 3 watch today,
[31:47.200 --> 31:49.520]  you're getting an Apple watch that just three years ago
[31:49.520 --> 31:50.960]  was the best Apple watch you could buy.
[31:54.000 --> 31:55.440]  Two things in there that you bring up,
[31:55.440 --> 31:56.400]  which I think is interesting.
[31:57.200 --> 32:02.400]  One is that I think that the iPhone 5C was actually,
[32:02.400 --> 32:05.840]  it's almost like it was the perfect, you said marketing
[32:05.840 --> 32:08.080]  when you meant sales wise, but it was the perfect
[32:08.080 --> 32:08.960]  marketing product, right?
[32:08.960 --> 32:10.400]  It looked great on those posters.
[32:10.400 --> 32:13.680]  And it's almost like, you know, did they, it's almost
[32:13.680 --> 32:16.560]  like it existed to be like the perfect marketing product
[32:16.560 --> 32:19.600]  for Apple, but not a great actual product for Apple.
[32:19.600 --> 32:22.480]  Because, you know, the colors just popped on all the posters
[32:22.480 --> 32:24.000]  that you see around the city.
[32:24.000 --> 32:26.800]  And it ended up being great, like for them to use in those
[32:26.800 --> 32:27.760]  promotional images.
[32:27.760 --> 32:30.080]  But then, yeah, just didn't resonate for whatever reason
[32:30.080 --> 32:31.200]  with the audience.
[32:32.080 --> 32:36.240]  But then you bring up, you know, the idea of what that was,
[32:36.240 --> 32:39.840]  which was trying to create a new product at a lower price
[32:39.840 --> 32:41.680]  point and how that hasn't worked for Apple in the past,
[32:41.680 --> 32:44.080]  which is interesting now because that's sort of exactly
[32:44.080 --> 32:47.360]  what they're doing with the iPhone, or sorry, the Apple
[32:47.360 --> 32:50.640]  watch SE, which I don't really understand.
[32:50.640 --> 32:52.720]  I mean, I conceptually understand what they're doing.
[32:52.720 --> 32:56.640]  It's essentially an Apple watch series five with a few
[32:57.200 --> 33:00.880]  features removed, including I think the always on screen.
[33:00.880 --> 33:01.280]  Yeah.
[33:01.280 --> 33:01.520]  Right.
[33:01.520 --> 33:06.880]  But it's sort of a weird choice in my mind because it's
[33:06.880 --> 33:09.680]  in between, as you noted, the series three, which you're
[33:09.680 --> 33:10.560]  still selling.
[33:10.560 --> 33:12.160]  So it's not the cheapest one.
[33:12.160 --> 33:15.440]  It's obviously not the best one, the highest end one.
[33:16.720 --> 33:19.520]  But it's not just a series five sold at a lower price.
[33:19.520 --> 33:21.360]  It's a new product.
[33:21.360 --> 33:24.080]  And why do you think they did it like that?
[33:26.560 --> 33:28.880]  I forget what chip it has.
[33:28.880 --> 33:32.080]  I think it actually has the it has the S five.
[33:32.080 --> 33:34.400]  I looked at it recently, so I know that it has the one
[33:34.400 --> 33:37.440]  that's the same as what the series five had.
[33:37.440 --> 33:37.920]  Huh?
[33:37.920 --> 33:47.120]  So I guess my take on the SE nomenclature is as they start
[33:47.120 --> 33:53.440]  to use it more is it is a way for them to make a product
[33:53.440 --> 33:57.520]  and put it out and keep it unchanged in the lineup for
[33:57.520 --> 33:59.040]  years to come.
[33:59.040 --> 34:01.200]  And then they don't have to do it every year, right?
[34:01.200 --> 34:04.480]  And the name doesn't sound like it's getting older.
[34:04.480 --> 34:08.960]  So the series three watch isn't a bad product, but it is
[34:08.960 --> 34:10.480]  the older form factor.
[34:10.480 --> 34:13.200]  And when you look at them side by side, even with the
[34:13.200 --> 34:16.960]  screen off, you can you can see, oh, yeah, it's not, you
[34:16.960 --> 34:19.520]  know that, you know, when they change the actual form
[34:19.520 --> 34:23.040]  factors for the series four, it it definitely got sleeker
[34:23.040 --> 34:27.440]  and better looking just as a piece of jewelry on your wrist.
[34:28.160 --> 34:28.400]  Right.
[34:28.400 --> 34:32.640]  And but the series three is still a nice product.
[34:32.640 --> 34:36.800]  But the biggest problem with it is it sounds so old compared
[34:36.800 --> 34:39.920]  to the series six, three generations old, right?
[34:39.920 --> 34:46.080]  Whereas they come out now with the SE and two years from
[34:46.080 --> 34:49.760]  now that we'll be talking about the iPhone, the Apple watch
[34:49.760 --> 34:54.960]  series eight, if they still have the the the SE and the
[34:54.960 --> 34:57.360]  lineup, and now it's only one hundred and seventy nine
[34:57.360 --> 35:00.560]  dollars or something two years from now, it doesn't sound
[35:00.560 --> 35:01.680]  so old.
[35:01.680 --> 35:03.520]  And that's so I think that's what it is.
[35:03.520 --> 35:07.440]  I feel like the SE isn't really there so much for this
[35:07.440 --> 35:07.840]  year.
[35:07.840 --> 35:10.240]  I know there's, you know, maybe they're selling a zillion
[35:10.240 --> 35:14.400]  of them because the other angle is, OK, we say, you know,
[35:14.400 --> 35:17.280]  it's the oldest sales tactic in the world or one of them
[35:17.280 --> 35:20.080]  where you get people in the door with start.
[35:20.080 --> 35:23.440]  The whole lineup starts at one ninety nine, but then you
[35:23.440 --> 35:26.240]  get in and as soon as you, you know, you talk to somebody
[35:26.240 --> 35:29.280]  and you're like, well, for eighty bucks, this isn't that
[35:29.280 --> 35:30.960]  I really would like the SE.
[35:30.960 --> 35:32.800]  So I'm not saying they're not going to sell it this year,
[35:32.800 --> 35:37.120]  but I kind of feel like it's it's there to be exactly what
[35:37.120 --> 35:39.520]  it is unchanged for at least two or three years.
[35:40.080 --> 35:42.080]  I think that that's a really smart take.
[35:42.080 --> 35:43.440]  I think that that's probably right.
[35:43.440 --> 35:46.880]  It's sort of like resetting the baseline expectation and
[35:46.880 --> 35:49.920]  it's going to be this weird overhang for this year because
[35:50.480 --> 35:51.920]  of the things that we just talked about.
[35:51.920 --> 35:54.880]  But going forward, it sort of makes sense strategy wise.
[35:54.880 --> 35:57.520]  That also answers a question which I had when it was
[35:57.520 --> 36:01.040]  unveiled and I wasn't the only one, but it almost felt
[36:01.040 --> 36:03.920]  like it would have made more sense to call the SE the
[36:03.920 --> 36:06.720]  Apple Watch and then call the Series 6 the Apple Watch
[36:06.720 --> 36:09.600]  Pro and, you know, start sort of going down that path.
[36:09.600 --> 36:11.920]  But if as you're suggesting that they're going to keep
[36:11.920 --> 36:14.880]  the SE sort of as as they do with the iPhone, that it's
[36:14.880 --> 36:17.760]  like a an update every two years, not every one year,
[36:17.760 --> 36:19.520]  that makes a lot more sense because then it would just
[36:19.520 --> 36:23.120]  be weird to only update the Apple Watch Pro line and
[36:23.120 --> 36:25.040]  not the Apple Watch every year.
[36:25.040 --> 36:25.360]  Yeah.
[36:25.360 --> 36:28.480]  And I think the reason they can't go pro with the watch
[36:28.480 --> 36:32.080]  for just the new one is then you run into we're right
[36:32.080 --> 36:33.760]  back to talking about the difference between the
[36:33.760 --> 36:35.520]  aluminum models and the steel models.
[36:35.520 --> 36:35.920]  Yeah.
[36:35.920 --> 36:39.520]  And, you know, at least with the phones, steel versus
[36:39.520 --> 36:42.160]  aluminum is the distinction or part of the distinction
[36:42.160 --> 36:43.600]  between pro and not pro.
[36:43.600 --> 36:46.400]  And yeah, it's a good point.
[36:46.400 --> 36:48.560]  And I was that was actually what, you know, to bring it
[36:48.560 --> 36:52.480]  back to the blue, the blue aluminum model, there was one
[36:52.480 --> 36:53.280]  hesitation, right?
[36:53.280 --> 36:56.160]  The get it going down, downgrading as it were to
[36:56.160 --> 36:59.440]  aluminum, because frankly, the last aluminum one I had
[36:59.440 --> 37:01.280]  was, I think, two generations ago.
[37:01.280 --> 37:03.040]  And that's one where I had all sorts of problems with
[37:03.040 --> 37:03.200]  that.
[37:03.200 --> 37:05.200]  The screen kept popping out on its own.
[37:05.200 --> 37:07.280]  And I had this whole thing back and forth with Apple
[37:07.280 --> 37:09.360]  about it because, like, you know, they suggested that
[37:09.360 --> 37:11.360]  I did something to it and I really didn't do anything
[37:11.360 --> 37:11.600]  to it.
[37:11.600 --> 37:13.520]  The screen just popped out one day.
[37:13.520 --> 37:16.800]  And eventually, you know, I got them to replace it after
[37:16.800 --> 37:17.920]  a lot of back and forth.
[37:17.920 --> 37:20.320]  But so I was hesitant to do it because obviously the
[37:20.320 --> 37:21.760]  screens are also better.
[37:22.880 --> 37:25.680]  They're more, you know, they once called like ion X and
[37:25.680 --> 37:27.520]  the others, the crystal sapphire.
[37:27.520 --> 37:27.920]  Is that right?
[37:27.920 --> 37:28.800]  Yeah, yeah.
[37:28.800 --> 37:29.200]  Yeah.
[37:29.200 --> 37:32.880]  So the screens are better on the non aluminum ones as
[37:32.880 --> 37:33.040]  well.
[37:33.040 --> 37:34.160]  And so I was hesitant to do it.
[37:34.160 --> 37:36.880]  It seems like it's fine now.
[37:36.880 --> 37:39.840]  But that was another hesitation for sure about
[37:39.840 --> 37:41.920]  downgrading, quote unquote, to aluminum, though it is
[37:41.920 --> 37:42.560]  much lighter.
[37:42.560 --> 37:45.520]  You can tell by picking them up how much lighter the
[37:45.520 --> 37:47.680]  aluminum is versus certainly the stainless steel.
[37:47.680 --> 37:50.160]  And the one I had for the five was the titanium, which
[37:50.160 --> 37:52.000]  is a little bit lighter than the stainless steel.
[37:53.200 --> 37:57.920]  Not surprising given the material, but yeah, it's nice
[37:57.920 --> 37:59.760]  to have the sort of lightweight one.
[37:59.760 --> 38:03.760]  And to go back to the Johnny Ive point about, like, you
[38:03.760 --> 38:06.560]  know, I think they did a good job that it does look
[38:06.560 --> 38:07.280]  pretty elegant.
[38:08.080 --> 38:10.480]  Would it, will it, do they eventually go down the path
[38:10.480 --> 38:13.360]  of having like pink ones and like really garish looking
[38:13.360 --> 38:14.080]  colors?
[38:14.080 --> 38:14.560]  I don't know.
[38:15.520 --> 38:17.840]  I mean, you could make an argument that there's a market
[38:17.840 --> 38:18.480]  for that, right?
[38:18.480 --> 38:20.880]  With Swatch and everything else that, you know, that is
[38:20.880 --> 38:21.280]  long done.
[38:21.280 --> 38:26.640]  These sort of like, you know, just design forward, bright
[38:26.640 --> 38:28.800]  colored looking pieces.
[38:28.800 --> 38:31.920]  But that also is what you were talking about with Ive
[38:31.920 --> 38:32.800]  in particular.
[38:32.800 --> 38:35.600]  He obviously set up the Apple Watch and they released it
[38:35.600 --> 38:37.280]  thinking it would be a fashion device.
[38:37.280 --> 38:39.200]  And instead it ended up being a fitness device.
[38:39.200 --> 38:41.840]  And that was a fundamental mistake that they made in those
[38:41.840 --> 38:42.960]  early days.
[38:42.960 --> 38:45.680]  And it's, I think it's an interesting question to know if
[38:45.680 --> 38:48.560]  it ever could potentially get back to being a fashion
[38:48.560 --> 38:50.560]  device that's on par.
[38:50.560 --> 38:52.560]  I think part of it is certainly a fashion device right
[38:52.560 --> 38:55.360]  now, but can it ever be on par with the fitness stuff that
[38:55.360 --> 38:57.360]  they're doing and the health stuff that they're doing?
[38:57.360 --> 38:58.080]  I don't know.
[38:58.080 --> 38:58.480]  Yeah.
[38:58.480 --> 39:02.400]  And so my take, I think, and I think if I had, and I would
[39:02.400 --> 39:04.720]  love to have him, Johnny, if you're listening to the show,
[39:04.720 --> 39:06.800]  please pick up the phone.
[39:06.800 --> 39:07.280]  Come on down.
[39:07.280 --> 39:07.760]  Give me a call.
[39:07.760 --> 39:10.160]  I would love to talk to Johnny Ive again.
[39:11.200 --> 39:15.120]  And I think he would vehemently disagree in an honest way.
[39:15.120 --> 39:19.120]  And I think he would, not disseminating, but I think he
[39:19.120 --> 39:21.040]  would disagree with what I'm about to say.
[39:21.600 --> 39:27.600]  But I feel like they sort of penalized the aluminum models
[39:27.600 --> 39:32.640]  in the early years, fashion wise, where the only colors were
[39:32.640 --> 39:36.240]  regular aluminum and dark gray aluminum.
[39:36.240 --> 39:39.760]  And they don't look bad, and they're clearly the best selling
[39:39.760 --> 39:42.560]  models because they're lower priced and they have all the
[39:42.560 --> 39:43.440]  functionality.
[39:43.440 --> 39:47.440]  And to be clear, all of the functionality has always been
[39:47.440 --> 39:48.800]  available in those models.
[39:48.800 --> 39:55.040]  It's just the aluminum versus steel and the ceramic finishes
[39:55.040 --> 39:59.760]  in some of the years and now titanium in some of the addition
[39:59.760 --> 40:00.560]  models.
[40:00.560 --> 40:02.240]  But the functionality is always the same.
[40:02.240 --> 40:03.760]  The sensors are the same.
[40:03.760 --> 40:07.520]  And even with the ion glass, ion X glass, whatever they call
[40:07.520 --> 40:11.040]  it, and the sapphire, the display itself is the same.
[40:11.040 --> 40:13.840]  Like the OLED display has the same brightness.
[40:13.840 --> 40:17.920]  It's just that the actual glass that you can tap your fingernail
[40:17.920 --> 40:20.640]  on is glass versus sapphire.
[40:20.640 --> 40:23.520]  And glass can be scratched like your phone can.
[40:25.040 --> 40:28.400]  And the sapphire is remarkably scratch proof.
[40:28.400 --> 40:33.840]  But the thing about scratches too, and the whole real watch
[40:33.840 --> 40:36.560]  industry has moved to sapphire.
[40:36.560 --> 40:41.600]  I mean, it's really hard to find a watch for more than $500
[40:41.600 --> 40:43.840]  that doesn't have a sapphire crystal.
[40:45.280 --> 40:46.080]  And it's great.
[40:46.080 --> 40:48.560]  And there's optic advantages to it.
[40:48.560 --> 40:52.480]  And some watch brands make their sapphire very, very flat.
[40:52.480 --> 40:57.520]  Like a Rolex, a modern Rolex is perfectly flat because Rolex
[40:57.520 --> 40:59.600]  sort of doesn't like to show off stuff.
[41:00.640 --> 41:03.680]  Like the back of a Rolex never shows the movement,
[41:03.680 --> 41:06.960]  which is what a lot of fancy watches do now is they have,
[41:06.960 --> 41:10.320]  actually, and they use sapphire for that too, which is funny.
[41:10.320 --> 41:14.240]  Because it's on your wrist when you're wearing it.
[41:14.240 --> 41:15.920]  You're never going to scratch it, right?
[41:15.920 --> 41:18.560]  But they still use sapphire because you're spending,
[41:18.560 --> 41:21.280]  I don't know, $10,000, $15,000, $20,000, whatever it is.
[41:21.280 --> 41:22.240]  But they show off.
[41:22.240 --> 41:24.080]  They put a crystal on the back of the watch
[41:24.080 --> 41:27.600]  so you can see the internals and watch people really love that.
[41:30.080 --> 41:31.680]  Rolex doesn't play that game.
[41:31.680 --> 41:35.440]  But other brands will shape the sapphire into a bubble.
[41:35.440 --> 41:37.200]  And it has these neat optical effects.
[41:37.200 --> 41:38.560]  It looks very, very pretty.
[41:38.560 --> 41:39.060]  It can.
[41:40.000 --> 41:44.880]  And having it be scratch-proof is always better than getting a scratch.
[41:44.880 --> 41:47.840]  Nobody likes to get a scratch on anything they own.
[41:47.840 --> 41:48.880]  I know that.
[41:48.880 --> 41:54.880]  And I know this is why people are so opposed and averse to scratching
[41:54.880 --> 41:57.520]  that they'll buy their phone, put it in a case,
[41:58.160 --> 42:00.880]  and never take it out of the case knowing that.
[42:00.880 --> 42:02.800]  Or put those plastic shields over it.
[42:02.800 --> 42:04.640]  Right, put the plastic shields over it.
[42:04.640 --> 42:09.280]  And it's not because they can't afford to fix the screen.
[42:09.280 --> 42:13.920]  It's just that they're so averse to the idea of needing to someday.
[42:13.920 --> 42:18.640]  But then, therefore, they never actually use and appreciate the phone
[42:18.640 --> 42:22.000]  in its unscratched state without all this protective gear.
[42:22.560 --> 42:24.720]  But I'm not even saying they're making a mistake,
[42:24.720 --> 42:29.840]  because I feel like they would be so heartbroken and upset
[42:29.840 --> 42:32.880]  by scratching or a minor crack on the screen or something
[42:32.880 --> 42:34.640]  that they'd rather have it this way.
[42:35.360 --> 42:37.840]  So the sapphire is great for that regard.
[42:37.840 --> 42:42.400]  But the truth is that the way you see scratches on a watch crystal
[42:43.040 --> 42:47.440]  is the best way to see them is when you angle it towards a light source
[42:47.440 --> 42:51.120]  to get a refraction.
[42:52.480 --> 42:54.480]  You have to try to see the scratches.
[42:55.040 --> 42:57.280]  Whereas when you're actually trying to read your watch,
[42:57.280 --> 43:02.000]  whether it's a digital Apple Watch with an OLED screen or a mechanical watch,
[43:02.000 --> 43:06.400]  the last thing you want to do is have a reflecting light source in it.
[43:06.400 --> 43:09.280]  You turn your wrist in a way that you don't see the scratches.
[43:10.560 --> 43:11.840]  And I've looked at my son's watch.
[43:12.720 --> 43:15.280]  I think we got him in the Series 4 when the Series 4 came out,
[43:15.280 --> 43:16.720]  so it's two years old.
[43:16.720 --> 43:20.560]  So a 16-year-old, it was not reckless.
[43:20.560 --> 43:21.680]  He's very careful with this stuff.
[43:21.680 --> 43:26.640]  But when I look at his Apple Watch, it is definitely scratched up.
[43:26.640 --> 43:28.560]  The ion glass definitely gets scratches.
[43:28.560 --> 43:31.280]  But when you actually go to read it, you don't see any of the scratches.
[43:33.360 --> 43:36.400]  It's not something that people should really be overly worried about
[43:36.400 --> 43:40.400]  in terms of, ooh, is the main reason you should upgrade
[43:40.400 --> 43:44.960]  and spend $300 more on a steel Apple Watch to get the sapphire?
[43:44.960 --> 43:45.200]  No.
[43:45.200 --> 43:46.720]  All right, right, right.
[43:46.720 --> 43:52.240]  But anyway, I just think that the blue and the red is a sign that Apple is trying,
[43:52.240 --> 43:58.720]  they're doing the best they can to make the aluminum models as cool
[43:58.720 --> 44:05.200]  and just beautiful objects as they can in a way that I don't think they tried in the early years.
[44:06.000 --> 44:06.960]  Yeah, I think that's right.
[44:06.960 --> 44:08.800]  And I think they did a good job with it.
[44:08.800 --> 44:14.480]  And yeah, I mean, I would anticipate these things will sell like crazy as a result of that.
[44:14.480 --> 44:14.800]  Yeah.
[44:14.800 --> 44:19.040]  And the blue in particular, it's just, I can't wait to see it in person.
[44:19.040 --> 44:24.480]  It's the first, I would never think I'd want a blue watch, but I see the pictures of it.
[44:24.480 --> 44:27.760]  And I'm like, well, if I ever did want a blue watch, though, it would be this kind of blue.
[44:30.240 --> 44:33.200]  One other thing about this, which you'll appreciate,
[44:33.200 --> 44:39.600]  because I know you wrote one of the pieces about the whole trying on the loop thing.
[44:39.600 --> 44:40.320]  Oh, God.
[44:40.320 --> 44:46.720]  Yours is actually useful because you did the lining up of the holes with what the size
[44:46.720 --> 44:50.960]  should be, which I found immensely useful in trying to think about which size they should get.
[44:53.520 --> 44:58.320]  Obviously, Apple made a mistake in not allowing people to return them when...
[44:59.760 --> 45:01.440]  Without returning the whole watch.
[45:01.440 --> 45:04.320]  Right, without returning the whole watch when they probably weren't going to pick the right size.
[45:04.320 --> 45:08.560]  And it's to the point where I actually did go to an Apple store this week.
[45:08.560 --> 45:10.720]  I actually went to go just to take back.
[45:10.720 --> 45:12.400]  I was driving around anyway.
[45:12.400 --> 45:17.600]  And so I put my life in my own hands to go into a store.
[45:17.600 --> 45:21.600]  And I wanted to return the previous model.
[45:22.960 --> 45:24.720]  And so I could do that in the store.
[45:24.720 --> 45:26.400]  And so I just ran in there to go do it.
[45:26.400 --> 45:29.840]  But while I was in there, I decided, well, since I'm here, I'm going to try on one of the loops.
[45:29.840 --> 45:33.920]  Because I didn't get the loop for the very reasons that we're talking about.
[45:33.920 --> 45:38.880]  I was terrified that I just would pick the wrong size, even with their printout and everything.
[45:38.880 --> 45:41.520]  And it turns out, so I went to the Apple store and I used their...
[45:42.480 --> 45:49.040]  In the Apple store, they have this more professional version of the printout thing,
[45:49.040 --> 45:53.360]  including like you unwrap it yourself.
[45:53.360 --> 45:56.160]  And it's nicely made, as you might expect.
[45:56.160 --> 45:59.120]  But when I tried to use it to see what size I would be,
[45:59.840 --> 46:03.520]  and then went to go try on the size that they suggested, it was wrong.
[46:03.520 --> 46:04.960]  I swear, it was wrong.
[46:04.960 --> 46:08.800]  It said that I should be an eight, and I should be a seven.
[46:08.800 --> 46:11.040]  When I actually tried on the thing, the eight was too loose.
[46:11.040 --> 46:17.360]  And I care about that because with the heart monitor, or sorry, the blood oxygen monitor,
[46:17.360 --> 46:18.400]  it has to be tight.
[46:18.400 --> 46:21.680]  It's always complaining that it's too loose.
[46:21.680 --> 46:22.560]  Yes, yes.
[46:22.560 --> 46:29.280]  And so, you know, obviously, it's just Apple wrote out this feature with the loop, you know,
[46:29.280 --> 46:34.240]  and these things, you know, together in parallel, like, need to work in perfection in order
[46:34.240 --> 46:35.760]  for that feature to work.
[46:35.760 --> 46:40.320]  But I swear, the in-house tool that they use gives you the wrong size.
[46:40.320 --> 46:40.820]  Yeah.
[46:41.760 --> 46:46.080]  I still remember, and you know, I've got a teenager, so I'm going through it.
[46:47.520 --> 46:54.880]  I remember as a kid and now as a parent, what growth spurts are like and how annoying it
[46:54.880 --> 46:58.480]  is to not know what shoe size you take.
[46:58.480 --> 47:01.680]  And I know what it's like to have shoes that are too tight.
[47:01.680 --> 47:03.600]  That's miserable, right?
[47:04.640 --> 47:11.040]  And I also know what it's like to have the attention span and zero interest in shoe shopping,
[47:11.040 --> 47:11.540]  right?
[47:12.800 --> 47:13.300]  Right.
[47:13.760 --> 47:19.920]  But if you ever actually look at, like, the thing they have at a shoe store, and, you
[47:19.920 --> 47:21.920]  know, the thing you put your foot on.
[47:21.920 --> 47:22.560]  Yeah, that scale.
[47:22.560 --> 47:24.880]  The little scale or ruler, whatever you want to call it.
[47:24.880 --> 47:25.760]  Yeah, the ruler, right.
[47:25.760 --> 47:31.280]  The difference between shoe sizes, like, between a 10 and 11, it's really small.
[47:31.280 --> 47:35.200]  And most people shop by half sizes, which are really, really small.
[47:35.200 --> 47:37.520]  But you know, like, I've had shoes.
[47:37.520 --> 47:41.280]  I've bought, like, new pairs of shoes and had them, like, I feel like this is a half
[47:41.280 --> 47:43.920]  size too big or small, and it makes you miserable.
[47:45.360 --> 47:47.280]  The loop bands are exactly like that.
[47:47.280 --> 47:48.400]  Like, you can measure it.
[47:48.400 --> 47:53.840]  And again, if you've ever been to the shoe store and you put your foot on the thing and
[47:53.840 --> 47:59.200]  the guy says, you are an 11, and then you try on the 11, you're like, feels tight.
[47:59.200 --> 48:02.800]  And then the salesperson will be like, you know what, you're right, that does feel tight.
[48:02.800 --> 48:04.240]  Here, let me go get an 11 and a half.
[48:05.520 --> 48:07.040]  And you're like, yeah, that's much better.
[48:07.040 --> 48:10.480]  And it's exactly like that with the loop bands.
[48:10.480 --> 48:14.160]  I feel like you can measure it as perfectly as you can with the tool.
[48:14.160 --> 48:19.040]  Do it exactly the right way, and you still might not get the right size.
[48:19.040 --> 48:24.640]  Because the difference between a seven and a six or a seven and an eight, it's like five
[48:24.640 --> 48:25.280]  millimeters.
[48:25.280 --> 48:26.400]  It's really small.
[48:28.560 --> 48:29.840]  Yeah, I'm surprised at Apple.
[48:30.480 --> 48:33.360]  Obviously, it's a good looking product, both the loop and the braided loop.
[48:33.360 --> 48:34.240]  They look great.
[48:34.240 --> 48:37.280]  It's nice to have this one seamless loop, continuous loop.
[48:38.000 --> 48:42.240]  But it seems like such a headache from a SKU perspective and everything, right?
[48:42.240 --> 48:45.120]  And obviously, that's proven to be the case in these early days.
[48:45.120 --> 48:49.920]  But even still, going in and having to have all these people try on multiple different
[48:49.920 --> 48:52.240]  versions of it, I'm surprised.
[48:54.240 --> 48:56.080]  I obsess over the things like this.
[48:56.080 --> 49:00.480]  This is why I've spent more pixels on Daring Fireball writing about the loop size, because
[49:00.480 --> 49:08.800]  I just find it so fascinating because it's so minor, but yet still so interesting.
[49:08.800 --> 49:10.720]  I've heard about the tool they have at the stores.
[49:10.720 --> 49:12.560]  I keep meaning to go because I want to get one.
[49:12.560 --> 49:15.600]  A couple people who work at the stores who said you should come in and just get one of
[49:15.600 --> 49:16.880]  these things because they're kind of cool.
[49:19.200 --> 49:24.720]  But I would love to the fly on the wall conversations at Apple.
[49:24.720 --> 49:28.240]  Some of the ones I'm most interested in are the ones everybody's interested in.
[49:28.240 --> 49:35.680]  Like I would love to be a fly on the wall for the annual let's negotiate how much Google
[49:35.680 --> 49:39.040]  plays pays for default search placement in Safari, right?
[49:39.040 --> 49:44.480]  Everybody knows that must be really fascinating because it's tens of billions of dollars.
[49:46.640 --> 49:53.520]  I would love to have been in the meeting where the Apple Watch Band design team pitches Jeff
[49:53.520 --> 49:59.600]  Williams and or Tim Cook on, we would like to sell these stretchy bands.
[50:02.320 --> 50:05.520]  We're going to have eight or nine different sizes of them.
[50:05.520 --> 50:07.760]  For both widths, so it's 12 total.
[50:07.760 --> 50:13.920]  And if they don't fit right, you're really not going to be happy.
[50:17.120 --> 50:23.040]  And as you've noted in the past, they have one of the most elegant solutions for this
[50:24.080 --> 50:30.160]  with the current, the non-loop model of the sport band that just tucks under.
[50:30.160 --> 50:31.600]  It's such a great solution.
[50:31.600 --> 50:38.400]  And it remains obviously in the lineup, but they're calling out that we think we can do
[50:38.400 --> 50:39.920]  this better, and then this is what we get.
[50:39.920 --> 50:43.600]  I can see why the designers wanted to do it because it is clever.
[50:43.600 --> 50:47.120]  And when it fits perfectly, it does feel incredibly elegant.
[50:47.920 --> 50:48.880]  It just feels amazing.
[50:48.880 --> 50:50.720]  It's just a rubber watch band.
[50:50.720 --> 50:59.280]  And again, that sort of thing is often very popular in the real watch world too.
[50:59.280 --> 51:05.920]  Like these NATO straps, these nylon bands that are sort of from the military world
[51:07.920 --> 51:08.960]  are super popular.
[51:08.960 --> 51:15.040]  And with certain sport watches, people will wear them with like $30,000 vintage Rolexes.
[51:15.920 --> 51:16.880]  Sometimes you have to.
[51:16.880 --> 51:22.560]  There's military versions of the Rolex where the spring bars, you know what a spring bar is,
[51:22.560 --> 51:22.800]  right?
[51:22.800 --> 51:26.400]  Everybody knows that's the thing in the watch that you have to push in and out to change
[51:26.400 --> 51:27.200]  the band.
[51:27.200 --> 51:32.720]  On certain older military Rolexes, those spring bars aren't springy at all.
[51:32.720 --> 51:38.400]  They're welded in place for the military purpose of, well, we want this to be something that
[51:38.400 --> 51:41.920]  can't possibly come out because these watches were made to...
[51:41.920 --> 51:46.720]  I mean, it sounds ridiculous that like in the 60s, the British military was buying Rolexes
[51:46.720 --> 51:49.920]  for the troops, but Rolexes only cost like $200 then.
[51:51.760 --> 51:55.600]  In terms of like how to make a fortune as a time traveler, going back in time and buying
[51:55.600 --> 52:00.720]  a bunch of Rolexes in 1968 and burying them somewhere safe and then coming back to the
[52:00.720 --> 52:05.680]  present is probably better than buying stock in Berkshire Hathaway.
[52:08.720 --> 52:10.880]  But those spring bars are welded in place.
[52:10.880 --> 52:13.760]  So you can't take them out to swap bands.
[52:13.760 --> 52:14.800]  So you need one of these...
[52:16.000 --> 52:20.800]  They're meant to be used with the NATO bands that thread through the slots that are there
[52:20.800 --> 52:21.520]  with the spring bar.
[52:21.520 --> 52:26.640]  So there are people in the watch world who love super simple bands, but these are amazing.
[52:26.640 --> 52:30.160]  They're so elegant, but I just would love to have been there.
[52:30.160 --> 52:35.600]  I could see why the designers wanted them, but to pitch it on what's considered an operations
[52:35.600 --> 52:36.480]  first company...
[52:36.480 --> 52:38.000]  Right.
[52:38.960 --> 52:40.480]  You want how many SKUs?
[52:41.760 --> 52:46.880]  We can fit all of the SKUs on the table for all Apple products unless we include the Apple
[52:46.880 --> 52:48.560]  Watch loops, then we cannot.
[52:48.560 --> 52:52.880]  In which case we need a warehouse.
[52:52.880 --> 52:53.600]  Right.
[52:53.600 --> 52:54.160]  I love it.
[52:56.720 --> 52:59.600]  Let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor.
[52:59.600 --> 53:02.640]  It is our good friends at Squarespace.
[53:02.640 --> 53:04.640]  Oh man, do I love Squarespace.
[53:04.640 --> 53:11.360]  Squarespace is your all in one, build your own, create your own, edit your own, modify

[53:29.680 --> 53:31.280]  there in Squarespace.
[53:32.560 --> 53:39.040]  You can do it all and they've got great analytics and anything you want to do that lets you
[53:39.040 --> 53:44.160]  focus on the thing you're making that the website's about as opposed to spending all

[53:49.920 --> 53:53.760]  thing and not worry about the website that's about the thing.

[53:55.600 --> 53:56.720]  It is a great product.
[53:56.720 --> 54:00.960]  I have so many friends who go to Squarespace all the time for the stuff they build.
[54:00.960 --> 54:03.760]  My friend Adam, Lisa Gore has a new podcast out.
[54:05.120 --> 54:06.720]  What they do for their website, guess what?
[54:06.720 --> 54:08.160]  Squarespace.
[54:09.680 --> 54:11.680]  It is all terrific.
[54:12.400 --> 54:13.440]  Where do you go to find out more?
[54:13.440 --> 54:15.920]  Go to squarespace.com slash talk show.

[54:23.360 --> 54:26.240]  So go to squarespace.com slash talk show.
[54:27.040 --> 54:27.760]  Find out more.
[54:29.600 --> 54:31.440]  One last thing before we get to news.
[54:31.440 --> 54:32.240]  You had a great piece.
[54:32.240 --> 54:33.920]  I've been meaning to write about this.
[54:33.920 --> 54:36.560]  iOS 14 clips, app clips.
[54:36.560 --> 54:37.840]  Yeah, app clips, right.
[54:37.840 --> 54:42.720]  And there's this game that has an app clip and I saw this.
[54:42.720 --> 54:45.840]  I still haven't linked to it from Daring Fireball, but I was like, this is amazing.
[54:45.840 --> 54:48.320]  Why wasn't this the demo at WWDC?
[54:49.200 --> 54:50.240]  I totally agree.
[54:50.240 --> 54:51.600]  It's called Phoenix 2.
[54:52.880 --> 54:54.880]  And I think I, it came on my radar.
[54:54.880 --> 54:59.040]  I think MacRumors linked to it first, maybe Touch Arcade, right?
[54:59.040 --> 54:59.920]  One of their affiliates.
[54:59.920 --> 55:06.960]  And so, yeah, so when they did the demo of app clips, right, they, they basically highlighted
[55:06.960 --> 55:11.200]  how good it would be for things like walking into a neighborhood restaurant where you don't
[55:11.200 --> 55:14.960]  have the app necessarily, but they have an app and you, but you don't necessarily want
[55:14.960 --> 55:18.320]  to download the entire app to use, to have to use in the restaurant.
[55:18.320 --> 55:19.840]  And it seems like that's a great use case.
[55:19.840 --> 55:22.080]  It's obvious, makes all sense in the world.
[55:22.080 --> 55:25.120]  I feel like they totally underplayed something like this.
[55:25.120 --> 55:28.080]  So basically there's this game Phoenix 2.
[55:28.080 --> 55:30.000]  It is a sort of space shooter game.
[55:31.680 --> 55:39.920]  And you can go on your iPhone to the site that they have for just the website and, and
[55:39.920 --> 55:46.080]  it will pop up a little thing at the top and it's just, you click it and it says play.
[55:46.080 --> 55:49.680]  And then you click on that and then it pops up on an iOS device.
[55:49.680 --> 55:50.800]  It pops up an overlay.
[55:51.920 --> 55:56.640]  That's sort of like you know, it's what the app clip one looks like.
[55:56.640 --> 56:00.880]  It's, it's basically from the bottom and it, and it shows like a little bit about the
[56:00.880 --> 56:01.680]  game.
[56:01.680 --> 56:06.400]  And then you click play again, and then you wait about 10 to 15 seconds in the few times
[56:06.400 --> 56:07.200]  that I've done it.
[56:07.200 --> 56:12.800]  And then you're in the app playing because it's basically not downloading the entire
[56:12.800 --> 56:13.440]  game.
[56:13.440 --> 56:18.560]  It's downloading, I think the first level of it and it downloads it as a, it is like
[56:18.560 --> 56:20.880]  an app from what I can tell, but it's not the full app.
[56:20.880 --> 56:21.360]  Right.
[56:21.360 --> 56:26.320]  And they do it, you know, in a clever way where it has like this, like a scissor cut,
[56:26.320 --> 56:27.520]  you know, outline around it.
[56:27.520 --> 56:29.440]  So you know that it's like not the full app.
[56:30.080 --> 56:32.000]  But it's amazing how seamless it is.
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.640]  And the app runs just like a regular native app.
[56:34.640 --> 56:38.480]  I mean, presumably again, it is all native code and it's just like the first level of
[56:38.480 --> 56:38.720]  it.
[56:38.720 --> 56:40.720]  I was just blown away by how seamless it is.
[56:40.720 --> 56:44.800]  And you know, when I wrote about this and, and others have linked to it and the touch
[56:44.800 --> 56:48.240]  arcade stuff, it's like everyone seems to have the same reaction, which is like, wow,
[56:48.240 --> 56:51.200]  this is, this is absolutely the way that you should do game demos.
[56:51.200 --> 56:52.720]  And how is everyone not using this?
[56:52.720 --> 56:56.560]  Yeah, and it's sort of, you know, and it would even work.
[56:56.560 --> 57:00.880]  I don't, I'm not even sure what Phoenix two is doing as their sales model, but you know,
[57:00.880 --> 57:06.000]  in terms of that whole try before you buy, do you need an in-app purchase or do you want
[57:06.000 --> 57:09.600]  to just sell it for three bucks and you have to pay the three bucks before you play the
[57:09.600 --> 57:14.480]  app clip idea gets around that where the clip is free.
[57:14.480 --> 57:19.920]  It's a quicker download because you only have to put the first level in and then you could
[57:19.920 --> 57:24.000]  make the app three bucks, five bucks, whatever the app costs.
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.160]  I think that's actually what they're doing too.
[57:26.160 --> 57:27.200]  I'm not a hundred percent.
[57:27.200 --> 57:28.880]  I did play to the end of the demo.
[57:28.880 --> 57:32.800]  And then when you get to the end, it just has a screen that shows like, you know, I
[57:32.800 --> 57:35.600]  think it says like, yeah, $2.99 to then download the entire thing.
[57:35.600 --> 57:36.640]  It's possible it's free.
[57:36.640 --> 57:41.840]  And then, you know, they just are going to do you know, monetize via in-app, but I think
[57:41.840 --> 57:44.160]  that it is paid and then you, you just get to it.
[57:44.160 --> 57:45.760]  So it's exactly what you're saying.
[57:45.760 --> 57:49.680]  It is like, I mean, I don't know why, again, everyone is doing this.
[57:49.680 --> 57:54.080]  And I actually talked to the developers of the game about it a little bit.
[57:55.200 --> 58:00.480]  And, you know, they obviously say that it's maybe not as easy as it makes it seem like
[58:00.480 --> 58:01.200]  just when you're playing it.
[58:01.200 --> 58:05.600]  And I'm sure that's true, but I'm surprised that Apple just hasn't sort of pushed forward
[58:06.320 --> 58:06.880]  this notion.
[58:06.880 --> 58:10.240]  Maybe they're holding it back until, you know, they feel like app clips have been out in
[58:10.240 --> 58:12.560]  the wild for a little bit and to test it out a little bit more.
[58:12.560 --> 58:18.400]  But I have to believe that this is sort of the future of demos and yeah, free trials.
[58:18.400 --> 58:23.760]  Yeah, and it was the first app clip I was really excited to try because I'm not really
[58:23.760 --> 58:24.800]  going to restaurants.
[58:24.800 --> 58:29.360]  I haven't parked my car anywhere except at my house in seven months.
[58:30.160 --> 58:34.480]  Well, you know, other than occasional errands, you know, I haven't used a parking garage.
[58:36.560 --> 58:39.040]  And all of a sudden here, well, I would like to try this game.
[58:39.040 --> 58:43.040]  It's like a Galaga sort of 1942.
[58:43.040 --> 58:45.040]  1942 was huge when I was in high school.
[58:45.040 --> 58:50.160]  It's just sort of a ship that goes up the screen and shoots everything it sees.
[58:51.920 --> 58:55.360]  You know, it's not really my type of game for the iPhone, but I enjoyed playing.
[58:55.360 --> 58:57.120]  I enjoyed the heck out of playing the demo.
[58:57.840 --> 58:58.960]  Yeah, I'm the exact same.
[59:00.000 --> 59:05.920]  The thing I ran into then after this was that because it was my first excuse to use an app
[59:05.920 --> 59:09.600]  clip, I suddenly realized, well, wait, how do you get rid of an app clip?
[59:09.600 --> 59:10.960]  What if I'm like done?
[59:10.960 --> 59:18.400]  And I honestly feel like because we didn't get to try third party app clips over the
[59:18.400 --> 59:21.520]  summer, or at least I didn't, you know, because they're not in the app store, you'd have
[59:21.520 --> 59:23.120]  to be like on a test flight or something.
[59:25.120 --> 59:27.600]  It's very strange the way it interacts.
[59:28.320 --> 59:32.960]  The clips interact with the new app library concept, right?
[59:32.960 --> 59:33.440]  Right.
[59:33.440 --> 59:40.320]  So like, because they go into recently downloaded recently, whatever recent apps.
[59:40.320 --> 59:42.480]  And you can't delete it, though.
[59:43.200 --> 59:44.160]  I noticed that too.
[59:44.960 --> 59:49.680]  It seems like they're taking the mentality exactly like that you shouldn't be manually
[59:49.680 --> 59:50.640]  quitting apps, right?
[59:50.640 --> 59:53.520]  Like they view it that let the system take care of that.
[59:53.520 --> 59:54.480]  Don't worry about it.
[59:54.480 --> 59:58.720]  So it basically goes away after an upset period of time, which is not clear.
[59:58.720 --> 59:59.680]  But I'm with you.
[59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.400]  I tried to do that and you can't do anything with it.
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:06.400]  I don't even think you can drag the app clip onto your screen if I'm right.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.520]  Yeah, I don't think so either.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:14.800]  Yeah, it's like it has to stay in the library and only be launched like from the library
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:20.240]  or from the series, the search at the top, spotlight search, whatever they call it.
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:25.120]  Well, and then it turns out you can delete it in settings.
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:26.240]  There's like somewhere to go.
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:30.800]  I actually, I was about to tell you how to go, but the phone in my pocket right now is
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.560]  still running iOS 13.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:33.680]  So I can't.
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:39.680]  But you go into settings something and then you like or just at the bottom of settings,
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:43.280]  you know how like all of your apps are listed in settings at the bottom.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:46.560]  If you just scroll through, I mean, if you go all the way to the bottom, there's a listing
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:52.000]  of clips and then you can go into the clip there and there's a button that says delete
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.240]  this clip and you can delete an app clip, but you have to go into settings to do it.
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:00.560]  But regular apps you can only delete from the home screen.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:04.960]  So it's this weird thing where I've always wanted to, I've always wished that there was
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:09.600]  a way to just give me an alphabetical list of all my apps because I would just like to,
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.120]  I'm in the mood to clean up, right?
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.200]  Like I'm in a tidying up mode.
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:17.440]  I would like to just see an alphabetical list of all my apps and just go swipe, swipe, swipe,
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.080]  never use it.
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.840]  That Caviar that was acquired by DoorDash don't need it.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:23.760]  Delete it, delete it.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:28.720]  And you can't, you always have to go on the home screen and go into jiggle mode and it's
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:32.320]  like one at a time, hit the little X and then confirm it.
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:37.280]  And it takes time and clips are the opposite where you can't just delete the app icon.
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.560]  You have to go into settings.
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.320]  It's a very strange, interesting.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.440]  Yeah, I have to, I need to complain about it and see if.
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:48.640]  And, and even now, so you, so what you're sort of asking for app library, when you click
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:52.480]  on the app library search thing, it does list them alphabetically, which is weird too, because
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:58.640]  it obviously like it gives prominence to anything that's named within a but you can't do
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.920]  anything beyond launch them there.
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:00.960]  You can't delete them or anything.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:01.460]  Right.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:04.800]  Let's talk about TV shows.
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:06.400]  Yes.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:09.120]  Is Apple TV plus the new HBO?
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.640]  That's your proposed section.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:11.760]  That's my prompt for you.
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:18.560]  So obviously this is not a new thought, but I do think that it's coming more into focus
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.800]  in particular with a few things that are happening right now.
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:27.040]  So first and foremost, I think you've seen online, I believe you've watched it as well.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.960]  I have, everyone's talking about Ted Lasso.
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:31.360]  I love Ted Lasso.
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.160]  It's a great show.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:35.360]  And it's a great show because, partially because I think people thought it wouldn't
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:38.240]  be a great show because it's, the premise of it is ridiculous.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:41.200]  Of course it's based on a commercial that ran, right?
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:47.040]  Like the idea that an American football coach can go and take over an English soccer club,
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:48.080]  an English football club.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.840]  And, you know, it seems like, yeah, it's a cute ad.
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.160]  It's a cute gimmick for an idea.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:58.960]  You know, maybe it's even a, you know, cutesy Adam Sandler 90 minute movie, but can it be
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:01.760]  like a TV show, like a full season?
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:06.720]  And it turns out not only can it, it's definitely the best show that's been on Apple TV plus
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.600]  so far.
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:12.320]  And I find it incredible the response to it just online.
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.600]  You won't find a person who doesn't seem to love that show.
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:17.920]  And obviously part of it is the world in which we live.
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:24.640]  And this is like such a refreshing break from both high drama, you know, a lot of the best
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:30.640]  shows on TV right now are all like, you know, hour long, very serious, very well done dramas
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:35.200]  and are violent and are, you know, something else that just reminds you of the crazy world
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:35.920]  in which we live.
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:37.200]  And this is just so refreshing.
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.000]  It's a half an hour.
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.800]  It's funny, it's cute, it's heartfelt.
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:45.040]  And I have to believe obviously that's why it's resonating with people so much, but it's
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.160]  also just really well done.
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:48.000]  It's really well done.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.040]  Moltz and I talked about it a couple episodes ago when it was earlier in the run.
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:56.320]  And I feel this feels like something I would have been late to.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:01.760]  And somehow I got early on and it was something about like, it was almost because I wanted
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.360]  it to be a different show.
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:08.640]  Like I was like in the mood for a stupid dumb guy comedy.
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:14.080]  And I thought, you know, and I was familiar with the, the, the, and that's sort of how
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:17.600]  the commercials were years ago when the Ted Lasso character was created.
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:26.000]  It was played as the silly gag that it is, um, you know, something like a 30 Rock, absurd
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.160]  joke, joke, joke type thing.
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:29.840]  And I was a big fan of 30 Rock.
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:30.560]  I love that show.
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:35.920]  And hopefully, and I thought, you know, it's funny, I didn't think of Adam Sandler, but
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:40.000]  that would have been, and again, I'm not an Adam Sandler hater and, you know, I can get
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.720]  into a dumb Adam Sandler movie if it's, you know, if it's one of the better ones.
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:50.560]  Um, but that was sort of what I was hoping it wasn't, you know, uh, cause I was like,
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:54.000]  how are you going to, cause again, yeah, like you said, you could do 90 minutes of that
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.160]  fish out of water, but then how do you do 10 weeks of it full season?
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:01.360]  Um, and that's just not it at all.
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.800]  And it's just a really amazing show.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:08.000]  I'm telling you anybody out there, I know you've heard me talk about it on the show.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  I'm telling, I don't know anybody who doesn't like it.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:16.480]  I, I, and it's just, it's uncanny how many people of different tastes and whose taste
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:19.920]  and shows is different and it closest I can come.
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:25.280]  And again, it's not like cheers, but it's like in a way that everybody liked cheers,
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:25.760]  you know?
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.680]  Yeah, I can see that analogy.
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:33.040]  I, it reminds me, it's not like this either, but because the plot, the high level plot
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.880]  is similar to major league number.
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:35.280]  Yeah.
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:39.040]  I know it well because I grew up in Cleveland about the Indians, but, you know, it's like
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:47.120]  an owner, you know, in both cases, a female, you know, spouse of a former owner is taking
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:51.920]  over a team to basically try to run it into the ground to be able to sell it or to move
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:52.480]  it elsewhere.
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:54.320]  And so that's like the high level premise of both.
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:59.440]  And so that ends up being like, you know, the kickoff point and Ted Lasso is definitely
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:04.480]  more, again, heartfelt than major leagues, but major leagues is also a great movie for
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:06.080]  some, for some of the same reasons, right?
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:11.760]  And I think you're right that the cheers, like the camaraderie aspect of it, again,
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:16.720]  going back to what we were talking about earlier, I also just think it's the perfect place,
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:19.040]  the perfect time for this type of thing, right?
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:22.400]  And so they just nailed it in that regard.
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:28.080]  And I think that that speaks to, you know, what my setup for the question about is Apple
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.440]  TV plus the new HBO.
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:33.120]  I don't know if this is necessarily a show you would have seen on HBO, though I don't
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:35.120]  think it's totally different either, right?
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:41.120]  Like they, HBO has long had the sort of 30 minute, more fun style shows.
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.680]  I don't even know if 30 minutes, maybe what, because there's no commercial thing.
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.520]  What about Curb Your Enthusiasm?
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.040]  Curb Your Enthusiasm is a good example.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.960]  Entourage back in the day, the Ballers show, I don't know how long that actually is, but
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:57.120]  all of those things are sort of in, in a vein that you could sort of, you know, feel like
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:03.680]  is of that, but that mixed with sort of the morning show, which I don't know your view
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:08.480]  on, but I went into that as the first Marquee show and I was super skeptical at first, certainly
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.240]  for the first few episodes, sort of felt a little bit too like an Apple, too much like
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:15.440]  an Apple commercial, like they were going out of their way, you know, to use iPhones
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.120]  and as the alarm clock and things like that.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:21.120]  But then by the end of the run of the first season, I thought it was actually really good
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.840]  and I was surprised by how good it got.
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:27.120]  And then I just, we just actually last night started watching another one.
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:28.400]  I don't know if you've seen it yet.
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.200]  It's called Tehran.
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.080]  I have not started.
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:31.680]  It's good.
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:32.240]  It's really good.
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:35.200]  It's sort of like a Bourne Identity type show.
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:39.520]  Let's talk about the, that has a lot of nuance.
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:44.080]  It seems like at least in these first few episodes about the Israeli Iranian situation
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:47.840]  conflict and the two sides there, it's really well done.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:53.280]  And so all of these are leading me to wonder like, I know that this is sort of the premise
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:59.840]  that maybe Apple kicked off with, that they could create these very high value, high production
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:03.600]  value shows in the vein of HBO back in the day.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:09.120]  And meanwhile, it feels like HBO has totally ceded that ground partially, obviously, because
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:12.640]  of what AT&T, their parent company, has asked them to do.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:17.280]  And when they came in and sort of said, we need to scale this in order to compete with
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:24.880]  Netflix, they've ceded, I think, what has been the historical stronghold of HBO.
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:28.960]  And I think Apple can now fill that slot, oddly, with Apple TV Plus.
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.360]  And we were all skeptical that, can Apple actually do content?
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:34.400]  And I think they're proving to do a good job, which is surprising to me.
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.880]  It's an interesting notion.
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:42.880]  The other show that I really liked, our whole family did, and it's getting, it's rarer
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:46.080]  these days with a 16-year-old to find a show that all three of us like.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:50.720]  But the other one that we really liked was Servant, which is M. Night Shyamalan's.
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.480]  Ah, yeah, I never watched that.
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:53.040]  That was good?
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:54.480]  It is.
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:55.200]  It's creepy.
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:01.760]  Again, I think because it's so creepy, it's not for everyone.
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:05.600]  Like, you've got to be into a sort of horror mindset.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:12.400]  It happens to shoot in our, not just in Philadelphia, but in our neighborhood, which is...
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:14.240]  All right, because he's a big Philadelphia guy, right?
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:14.240]  Yeah.
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.640]  Like all the movies are there.
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:20.720]  It's really, really close to where we live, where they shoot a lot of the exteriors.
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:30.080]  Like, such that we're in the neighborhood where we get the protest posters from people
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:33.680]  who are like, and again, it's because it's a nice neighborhood.
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:35.440]  It's people who are upset about parking.
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:38.400]  And it's like, oh my God, just shut up.
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:40.400]  There's a cool TV show shooting in the neighborhood.
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.080]  Park your car somewhere else.
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:44.080]  But we liked it.
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.040]  And it's well done.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:49.760]  I don't think it has the universal appeal of Ted Lasso, but it is good.
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:50.800]  It's a good show.
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:54.400]  And I see it.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:10:01.760]  And I feel like the similarity here is, and I think Apple is going for this, which is
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:07.120]  we'll go for quality over quantity, right?
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:11.680]  Because Netflix owns quantity, and you're never going to out Netflix.
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:12.960]  You're never going to compete with that.
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:13.520]  Right.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:13.840]  Right.
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:15.600]  Because they're already there.
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:16.560]  What else?
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.480]  How could you out-compete Netflix?
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:21.680]  That's right.
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:25.760]  Like, AT&T is trying to get HBO to do that with HBO Max.
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:31.440]  But the reality is that they just, as a public company, they have a different business model
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:35.760]  than what Netflix has come up with, and the flywheel is already going.
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:38.800]  And you're not going to be able to out to just dump money.
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:42.400]  Even Apple, which has obviously more money than anyone to be able to spend on that, they
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:46.480]  don't have the right model, the business model, to be able to do that type of thing.
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:51.360]  And so they do seemingly have the right model, though, to recreate an HBO.
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:55.200]  And with HBO, again, I view it as seeding the ground, like when you think about HBO.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.840]  So obviously, I still have it.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:58.960]  I have HBO Max now.
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:03.360]  And there are still good shows on it.
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.200]  So Succession is one of them, for sure.
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:08.080]  It just won a bunch of Emmys, and rightfully so, I think.
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:12.640]  But I think a lot of the shows, and from what I've heard sort of through the grapevine,
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:16.080]  is that a lot of the stuff that's still great on there was from the last regime, right?
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.200]  It was already greenlit.
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.640]  It's already in production.
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:24.320]  I think maybe Watchmen was maybe the last one that's sort of the single season run.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:27.600]  And once that's over now, we're getting into these newer shows,
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.120]  which are just not resonating as well.
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:32.480]  I haven't watched the Lovecraft one.
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:33.840]  No, we haven't either.
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:38.720]  And so I think that that's pretty well received, but it's not getting the type of zeitgeist
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:42.080]  stuff that some of the other HBO shows have gotten in the past.
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:42.960]  And maybe it'll get there.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:46.800]  But some of the other ones, there's like a Jude Law one that doesn't seem to be
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:47.840]  going much of anywhere.
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.520]  The Pope show or whatever?
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.240]  There was the Pope one.
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:51.680]  I think there's another one, though, now.
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:57.840]  And from what I've heard, again, that there would be an overhang of time where there were
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:01.120]  these shows that were greenlit by the old regime that were in production and or old
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:05.680]  shows that are going into new seasons like Succession, which will continue for a few
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:05.920]  years.
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.120]  But then we're going to hit this wall.
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:13.360]  And there's just not going to beit's TBD how well they'll do going forward at
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:14.000]  that point.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:19.440]  And HBO's answer to that is to just pump out more and more type of content and try
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:23.360]  to get to the Netflix, maybe not fully Netflix scale because they won't be able to, but
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:25.280]  still get closer to that.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.520]  And I'm pretty skeptical of that.
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:36.000]  I do likeI was super skeptical once the AT&T crew came in and basically ran Richard
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  Plepler, who was running HBO for years and years.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.440]  They ran him out, obviously.
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:45.440]  And there was that famous town hall meeting with John Stankey, who's now in charge of
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:46.720]  all of AT&T at the time.
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:49.200]  I think he was just in charge of WarnerMedia.
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:50.720]  And now he's in charge of the whole thing.
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:53.600]  And there was this weird town hall that they did with the HBO folks.
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:57.280]  And it was clear at that point that things were not setting up well.
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.920]  And that played out over the next six, 12 months.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:07.920]  And now we're at this point where they brought in new people, including Jason Kyler, who
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.440]  I think is really well regarded.
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:14.960]  I don't know him personally, but I do think what he did at Hulu definitely seems like
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.640]  it was ahead of its time.
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:18.320]  And he's really highly regarded.
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:21.200]  So there's a chance that they can do something interesting here, but it's not going to
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.960]  be what HBO was, regardless.
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:27.360]  And again, I think Apple can step in and fill that void.
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:40.720]  It's sort of like you have to accept that some good ideas have a maximum scale of how
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:44.320]  much money it's going to make, how pervasive it's going to be.
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:53.120]  And I feel like in the cable TV era, HBO was about as successful as it could have been.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:14:00.080]  It's hard to imagine a scenario where the premise of, OK, you pay $30, $40, $50 a month
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:00.880]  for cable TV.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:05.600]  And I'm talking about when HBO came up, because I realize people pay a lot more than that
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:06.640]  for cable TV now.
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:13.360]  But the idea was, when I was a kid, that it was like, OK, you pay $30 a month for cable
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:17.680]  TV, and you get all these channels and these cable channels.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.840]  It was such a distinction.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:23.920]  Like ESPN was so clearly not one of the networks.
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:26.160]  It was like, it's nothing but sports all day.
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:36.480]  And just Turner Classic movies, what a strange channel compared to network TV.
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:38.160]  It's nothing but old movies.
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:40.400]  But if you like old movies, then they're good.
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.320]  And then you watch it, and there's commercials.
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:44.480]  And then here was this thing that was different.
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:46.320]  And it was, here's what we've got.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:51.520]  We've got new movies, like really recent, like ones that you remember being in the theater
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:54.320]  because they were in the theater like a year and a half ago.
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:57.440]  And we're going to show them with no commercials.
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:01.920]  And that sounded, when I was a kid, it was like, it just seemed crazy to me that this
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.360]  idea that they're, what do you mean?
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:06.080]  They're new movies with no commercials.
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:09.840]  Neither of those things were possible on the regular TV.
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:13.840]  But you got to pay like $10 a month.
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:23.920]  And if you can get $10 of family enjoyment per month watching this stuff, these movies,
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.960]  which it's the whole movie, that's the name, Home Box Office.
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:27.840]  It was all movies.
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:30.080]  And then they started making shows.
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:38.160]  It was really easy to say, this is easily worth $10 or $15 for us, The Sopranos and
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:40.880]  Six Feet Under and so many great shows.
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:45.120]  The Wire, it's the one that so many people think might be the best show ever made.
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:47.600]  That and The Sopranos.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:51.440]  A lot of the arguments over what's the best show ever are all between HBO shows.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.480]  Early HBO shows.
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:52.980]  Right.
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:57.120]  And is that worth $10 or $15?
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:01.600]  And then even when there was home video, it's like, what does it cost to rent a movie?
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:04.000]  Well, it costs like to get a tape for two nights.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.320]  It's $5 or $6 or something like that.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:11.760]  So it's easy to get to work the $10 or $15 that HBO costs into that equation and say,
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:12.720]  yeah, well, this is great.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:13.840]  Then we don't have to go anywhere.
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:14.640]  Nothing to send back.
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:23.680]  But the maximum scope of the idea of HBO, we're only going to show good stuff and you're
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:24.800]  going to pay extra for it.
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:25.360]  And that's it.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:30.080]  There's a maximum scale to how big that was going to be.
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:32.160]  And it's not as big as Netflix, right?
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:34.160]  Netflix is a bigger idea.
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.040]  It just is.
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:38.320]  You're comparing a very big planet to a sun.
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.480]  I think that's right.
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:46.720]  And it's interesting to look back upon because there was this famous sort of idea that would
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.400]  Netflix be able to become HBO faster than HBO could become Netflix was like a thing
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.840]  that people said back in the day, right?
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:17:00.880]  And it actually ended up not being the case at all because they ran a playbook which was
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:02.480]  similar in different eras, right?
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:08.800]  So you noted that HBO basically bootstrapped off of Hollywood movies without commercials,
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:11.280]  and then they eventually moved into their own content.
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.720]  And that own content eventually became the main product.
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:19.360]  Netflix did a very similar thing where they bootstrapped off of old shows basically more
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.720]  than movies, but they had movies too.
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:24.640]  And then were able to move into original content and that eventually became the thing.
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:29.600]  And now it's to the point where not only is it, I mean, it is being done at a scale that
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:35.920]  was previously could not be believed that they were spending this amount, doing this
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:40.640]  amount of new content on a yearly, on a monthly basis that they are right now.
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:44.240]  And it's like they just zoomed right past HBO.
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:52.320]  And I'm not sure that Netflix wanted to, Netflix even knew that they would do basically
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:57.360]  create a show for every type of person, every type of genre, all these different countries
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:00.960]  rather than being what HBO was, you know, sort of the high quality bar thing.
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:03.680]  Maybe they thought in the beginning, like with House of Cards, that yeah, they would
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:07.280]  aim for, you know, the HBO style show, high quality, and we'll just do a few of these
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.640]  because it's going to be so expensive.
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:13.440]  And somehow they were able to figure out a way to do this at scale that HBO now is we're
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:16.400]  talking about, like, you know, maybe things that they can try to do that, but they're
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.680]  not going to be able to because they don't have the right model to be able to do that.
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:27.200]  And Apple can, Apple doesn't need necessarily like HBO does to have this be one of the key
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:28.720]  pillars of the company.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:30.720]  They view it as part of the services narrative, right?
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:34.960]  It's a nice thing that that adds to their services story.
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:39.200]  It obviously helps sell Apple devices in some way.
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:40.880]  And so it makes sense for them to do it.
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:44.160]  And so HBO is like in this very precarious situation now.
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:50.640]  Yeah, it's, it's really interesting because I feel like all of those, oh, well, so this
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:54.480]  new thing, Netflix has to be like HBO and it's like, no, that's not their plan at all.
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:59.600]  So yeah, you're right that that whole, well, Netflix become HBO faster than HBO can become
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:00.800]  from Netflix.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:02.640]  That really was a bad framework.
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:04.080]  And I've used that.
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.680]  I know I use that myself.
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:11.520]  And it was, it's natural to look at a new thing and think it's going to be like the
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:12.080]  old thing.
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:14.000]  But, and I don't think it was wrong at the time either.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.120]  I just think that Netflix realized to their credit at some point, this is a way bigger
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:21.520]  opportunity than what HBO was doing, right?
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:28.560]  It's, you know, like Netflix became a gas giant, like Jupiter or Saturn and, and HBO
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:31.200]  is just like a nice planet, like a Venus, you know?
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:36.480]  And it's like, and then AT&T buys them up and they're like, okay, guys turn into a gas
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:36.960]  giant.
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:38.880]  And it's like, yeah, exactly right.
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:39.840]  You know, it doesn't work.
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:45.920]  And it's like, kind of ruining the thing that we had, you know, we had a nice thing and
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.360]  it's like, it just doesn't work.
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:51.120]  And I've talked about this on other podcasts before.
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:56.080]  I just find the, just the branding alone tells you everything you need to know about how
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:59.760]  misguided HBO is under current leadership.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:03.040]  Like, just call it HBO, just it.
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.000]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:07.840]  Or do the bigger thing and call it Warderman.
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:12.400]  Or something like that and have HBO be a part of it as being the high end part.
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:14.800]  And you should be able to subscribe to that separately if you want to.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:18.160]  There's reasons why they didn't do that, that I understand, right?
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:22.880]  There's, there's carrier agreements with the cable operators that they couldn't, you know,
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:25.680]  necessarily do it in that seamless of a way.
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:29.920]  But at the end of the day, that's obviously like, that's the play that they sort of missed.
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:34.880]  And you know, I think that you could see it again back in that original town hall with
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:41.040]  John Stankey and Richard Kleppler, like, you just knew that they were not going to be able
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:45.600]  to do it in the way that they thought it would be, that it would go down seamlessly.
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:46.800]  And it hasn't so far.
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:50.320]  And so we'll see, you know, what the new team in there is able to do.
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:51.440]  And they've talented people there.
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:54.480]  But, you know, I don't think they're going to be Netflix.
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:59.280]  And are they going to then pivot back to become, try to become HBO as it was again?
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.960]  I don't think, I think the cat's out of the bag there.
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:05.040]  And I think, again, Apple might end up sort of beating them to get back to that.
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:11.440]  There, there was a sense of HBO, like, it's not magic.
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:15.440]  Like the, the, the person who doesn't see the difference between a good show and a bad
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:20.880]  show and just doesn't have the taste, but just knows, well, this show's making a gazillion
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:25.520]  dollars and this one's dud, and this one, all the stars are on magazine covers and on
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:26.880]  TV, and this one's not.
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:32.080]  Uh, and HBO has this one that everybody's talking about and somebody other channel has
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:32.720]  this one.
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:36.800]  And so just saying it's on HBO, that's the difference, right?
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.560]  Get your show on HBO and it becomes it.
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:39.760]  That's not how it works.
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:41.680]  Like it's that you've got it backwards.
[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:48.000]  It was that HBO, the leadership, they were keenly aware of what's a good show and they
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.400]  were really, really, you know, like protective of the brand.
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:56.560]  It's, you know, a lot like Apple, where it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:00.960]  Apple where there's that thousand no's for every yes, you know, and that's right.
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:05.600]  And how do you make it so that every new product from Apple is a good product?
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:08.480]  Well, by saying no to everything else and only going with the hits.
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:13.360]  And how do you, how does HBO keep putting out good shows by being very careful, you
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:15.520]  know, and, and having good taste?
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:19.200]  I know, I don't remember the exact details, but you probably have a better idea, but I
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:22.000]  know the one that slipped through their fingers was Mad Men.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:22.480]  Mad Men.
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:22.880]  Yep.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:25.440]  Um, because yeah, they passed on it.
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:28.640]  Uh, and you know, that basically made AMC then, right?
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:33.040]  I mean, AMC was obviously in existence before then, but it, it became a prestige channel
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:37.920]  where it wasn't before it was showing old movies before, um, uh, movie classics.
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:38.160]  Right.
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:43.680]  And, um, and then became Mad Men and then it became, uh, Walking Dead and it became,
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:46.960]  uh, uh, Halt and Catch Fire, which is one of my all time favorite shows.
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:50.720]  Uh, um, and so it did, it became prestige television.
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:54.960]  Now they have a, they have, uh, AMC plus, I think that just launched as, uh, you know,
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:56.560]  I think it's an Apple TV channel now.
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:00.720]  Um, but yeah, they, that, that is one that they missed and they, you know, they, they
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:01.200]  talk about that.
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:02.560]  They, they totally missed on that.
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:02.880]  Right.
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:06.880]  And so it's almost more notable that they missed a good show, not that they put out
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:11.760]  a dud, whereas now it's just sort of like, oh, we've got a gazillion things.
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:14.720]  And I don't know, it's kind of sad, but I do.
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:18.000]  And I, I feel like it's such an interesting way to frame it.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.680]  And I know that there are still people who are Apple TV plus haters who are thinking
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:25.680]  they're really rolling their eyes and they're like, oh my God, one good show, Ted Lasso.
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:27.520]  And you guys are calling it the new HBO.
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:34.720]  But I kind of, I see it and I feel like the big difference is that Apple is a hundred
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:41.760]  percent willing to just let Apple TV plus be what it is and try to try to have just
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:44.160]  make it synonymous with good shows.
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:47.200]  And they also, and they're doing movies too, right?
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:51.840]  And this is like, you know, they, they bought the Tom Hanks Greyhound one, which is a great
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:52.080]  movie.
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:55.280]  It's a, you know, a nice sort of quick watch.
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:59.120]  Obviously it was, it was an opportunity that came about because of the COVID situation,
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.440]  but that's like, I can see that working as well.
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:03.440]  You know, they can do just like HBO used to do.
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:07.360]  They did, they did their own movies too, and you could do great movies, great shows, and
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:10.800]  just keep the, the, the bar, the quality bar high.
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:16.880]  You know, there was, there was early trepidation that Apple would be too hands-on, right?
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:19.760]  With the shows and the reports that maybe that was happening.
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:22.240]  And it seems like now that's quieted down.
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:27.120]  I think they've made, they've made a number of racy sort of episodes of various shows,
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:28.480]  if not the entire shows themselves.
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:30.400]  And so I think there's less fear about that.
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:33.520]  The talent then can be less fearful because that was the main concern, right?
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:36.960]  That if the talent felt like that, that Apple was meddling, they're not going to go there
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:41.360]  because they, that's why HBO with Plepler, they love that guy because they felt like
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:42.400]  he was on their side.
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:47.200]  He was, you know, the, the guy who was going to be their, their biggest champion to make
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:48.480]  sure that their show was a success.
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:54.640]  Once you sold him an HBO on your show, they're like, okay, we're sold, go do your thing.
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:59.040]  We'll get you a budget, you know, and we'll let you do your thing.
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:24:59.680]  We trust you.
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:02.240]  We're, you know, you're on Team HBO now, go do it.
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:07.120]  And I, I feel like that that stuff with Apple is one of those things I need to do a claim
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:12.320]  chowder on, um, because I feel like none of that panned out and nobody says it anymore
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.800]  because it obviously doesn't hold water there.
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:20.560]  There were reports that Tim Cook was giving notes to the show runners to be nicer.
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:24.800]  And it's like, man, you, you, you know, none of the, a lot of these, well, Ted Lasso is
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:28.880]  very nice, but not in a, not in a corny way, right?
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:30.640]  It still has crude things about it, right?
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:31.440]  I'll bet, you know what?
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:34.000]  I'll bet Tim Cook loves Ted Lasso.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:34.800]  Oh my God.
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:35.760]  You know, he does.
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.040]  But in a good way.
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:45.280]  But like, uh, uh, uh, the morning show is obviously Apple's premier to date award winner
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:48.800]  won a bunch, you know, got a bunch of Emmy nominations and I thought it was good.
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:49.520]  I agree with you.
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:54.080]  Um, I actually feel that I wanted to say this before we move on to a new topic for me and
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:26:00.240]  Amy, it was a lot like succession where at least for the first half, maybe even the first
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:05.680]  six episodes of the first season, we were kind of lukewarm, but just enough to keep
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:07.520]  going and then it heated up.
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:08.400]  I totally agree.
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:12.320]  I think that we were in the exact same boat with succession and with the morning show
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:16.800]  and then yeah, they both got good around the end, those last three episodes or so of the
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:20.880]  first season and then succession took off from there and now is, is, you know, multiple
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:24.480]  seasons in and the morning show is about to, I think, start production on the second season.
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:27.040]  So, uh, but yeah, I'm totally with you.
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:29.200]  And it wasn't that the first episodes were bad.
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:31.920]  It was that they, they served to set up stuff.
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:36.480]  It was like they did a lot of work and we're asking a bit of patience of you as the viewer
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:40.160]  to, you know, give us five hours to go through these episodes.
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:46.320]  Not that it's a slog, but that it's just a lot of foundational work for payoff later.
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:51.040]  And then all of a sudden it can start moving fast because it's building on this stuff from
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:52.000]  these other episodes.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.640]  And I, I, I really thought it was, I was like, this is just like succession when we were
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:58.960]  watching the, the, the morning show.
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:01.600]  And then the other thing too, and again, I don't want to give any spoilers for people
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:07.440]  haven't watched it yet, but any idea that they were going to shy away from, uh, R-rated
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:11.120]  subject matter, it's like, forget it.
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:12.560]  And this is their premiere show.
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:18.080]  This is the one where Tim Cook was there at the, the gala premiere and, you know, it's
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:21.920]  their award winner and they've spent a fortune promoting it and advertising and stuff like
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:22.640]  that.
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:26.080]  Um, and it's, you know, it is absolutely R-rated.
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:35.840]  I mean, it's, there's no, we're going to go with a Disney level of subject matter to it.
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:40.240]  You know, Servant, the only thing I would, Servant is a very creepy R-rated show.
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:41.120]  Oh yeah.
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:44.800]  That's where I had to the point where whenever it does the autoplay, I keep swiping away
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:45.520]  from it on the thing.
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:47.520]  It's like, what am I looking at here?
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:53.200]  But the only thing I would, I would say on that, um, I think you should do the claim
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:57.120]  chowder piece and hunt those things down.
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:02.240]  I will say I did hear from people, you know, I worked in, in Hollywood as very low level
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:06.880]  production assistant for a time and I still know some people there and I will say I did
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:12.160]  hear that as well, like the same, uh, the same type of idea that, that Apple was meddling
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:13.120]  from people there.
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:16.160]  So I do think that there was some element of truth to that.
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:21.280]  I don't think that it was, it was completely BS, but I, I almost wonder now if that doesn't
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:27.040]  um, signal well to Apple that they sort of quickly realize like, look, we're setting
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:29.920]  up to do, you know, we need to set this up for success.
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:31.280]  We're doing a big push.
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:36.320]  We're spending millions and tens of millions of dollars on this, uh, new initiative and
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:38.160]  trying to really make this a big thing.
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:43.280]  And one of our, one of the jewels of the Apple crown, let's, you know, let's run the
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:46.960]  playbook the way that, that, you know, a Hollywood studio would run it the way that HBO
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:47.520]  would run it.
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:49.920]  And let's let the creative talent do their thing.
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:53.920]  We'll be more hands off and, and we recognize that this is not like an Apple product type
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:54.160]  thing.
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:54.400]  All right.
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:58.240]  Let me just tell you the worst Apple TV plus show I've seen the worst.
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:28:58.640]  Okay.
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:28:59.600]  Amazing stories.
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:01.920]  The Spielberg one.
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:02.160]  Yep.
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:02.880]  I didn't watch it.
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:03.760]  Oh my God.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:09.200]  We only got, I think we, I forget if we watched three or four, but it was the only reason
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:13.520]  we stuck with it was the idea that it has to be better.
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:16.640]  We had, we were like, why would they make the first episode so bad?
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:19.120]  You'd think they'd put it at least make the first one good.
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:23.120]  And we're like, well, with the pedigree, it has to get better.
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:26.960]  And so we, we, I think we might've watched four, but, you know, and after four, we were
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:28.960]  just like, this is a dreck.
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:31.680]  This is really, are they, are they just like, are they hokey?
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:33.600]  Like what about hokey?
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:35.920]  And just, just unengaging.
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:39.360]  It's just, you know, it's like trying to strike a wet match, you know?
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:42.560]  And it's like, uh, just not good.
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:44.000]  Uh, really?
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:45.840]  Yeah.
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:49.040]  So, you know, they gotta, you gotta work out some cakes, but I mean, that's an
[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:50.640]  obvious sort of mistake to make, right?
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:54.480]  Like who would not work with Steven Spielberg on a, on a show, like a remake of a show that
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:55.680]  was, that was popular.
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:56.800]  Of course they're going to do that.
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:30:03.280]  And, and the one last point I think, you know, that speaks to, uh, why people are at some
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:05.520]  level we're rooting against, it seemed like Apple TV plus.
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:07.600]  Cause I think like the way that they presented it to the world, right.
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:13.840]  In that weird, weird, uh, conference that they did press conference, uh, events was,
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:15.840]  you know, sort of misguided in many ways.
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:16.160]  Right.
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:20.320]  Uh, because it's not something they tried to make an Apple event out of like, what was
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:21.920]  like an upfront basically.
[01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:23.760]  And, uh, it was weird.
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:25.760]  It was very weird with Oprah and everything.
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:28.800]  And, you know, they needed to let the content speak for itself and there, they didn't show
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:29.600]  any of the content.
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:33.200]  All they did was try out stars on stage to talk about how great it is to work with Apple.
[01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:39.600]  That was, you know, it was like, uh, it's like a, like a political theater type situation.
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:40.320]  It was very strange.
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:40.720]  Yeah.
[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:46.720]  That's another one where I feel like it, it, it was sort of like Apple has its way of doing
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:50.240]  announcements and Hollywood has its way of doing announcements and they are the way they
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:51.280]  are for good reasons.
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:54.640]  And then it came time to announce it and it was like a car crash.
[01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:57.200]  It was like, wait, it's like a collision.
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:02.400]  You know, like car crashes, bad analogy, but it's like two people who aren't paying attention
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:04.880]  to each other, who bump into each other and spill everything.
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:08.640]  It was like this style of presentation doesn't work with this.
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:12.960]  And it was truly, and it, I don't know that Apple even foresaw it.
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:17.920]  Like with the skepticism people had that, ah, I just don't believe that a tech company
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:19.840]  is going to do good in Hollywood.
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:24.240]  And then when they didn't show anything, it was like, yeah, there was a re the reason
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:26.240]  you don't show anything is that it's bad.
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:28.400]  And which is actually true, right?
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.400]  That is a reasonable assumption to make.
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:36.240]  All right, let's take a break and I will do and tell you about, uh, our third and final
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:37.040]  sponsor.
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:41.920]  Another repeat sponsor feels F E a L S.

[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:49.040]  This sounds like 2020 to me, chronic pain, trouble sleeping at least once a week.
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:50.720]  You are not alone.

[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:14.400]  One more time, fields.com Feals.com slash talk show.
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:19.120]  So while we're talking entertainment, we got to talk movies.
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:23.440]  And you are probably the biggest Christopher Nolan fan I know.
[01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:25.840]  And I'm a huge Christopher Nolan fan.
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:28.560]  Yeah, I am.
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:29.440]  I'm a big one.
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:33.760]  And so this past obviously few months has been fascinating to watch, mainly because
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:38.240]  like, I totally disagree with his stance on Tenet, what they've done.
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:44.640]  Because so, you know, as you know, they had Tenet done.
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:47.440]  It was going to be one of the big marquee movies this summer.
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:49.760]  Obviously, plans change, plans had to change.
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:55.120]  And rather than doing what everyone else has done and putting it out there and
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:57.600]  and postpone to next year.
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:02.320]  Obviously, they postponed Tenet a couple times to later in the summer, but they eventually
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:03.120]  just opened it.
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:07.520]  And you know, it hasn't done well at the box office, which is no surprise given the state
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:08.000]  of the world.
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:13.520]  But I think it's, I just think it was a mistake to launch it because I think it sets a bad,
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:16.560]  you know, I think it's the wrong tone.
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:22.800]  I think it's a bad idea to try to entice people to go to a movie theater if they're not at
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:23.760]  all comfortable with it.
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:26.240]  And obviously, some people are going to be comfortable with it.
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:30.480]  And some of the theaters, I'm sure, are doing a great job, you know, making sure everything
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:33.200]  is safe and clean and all that.
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:36.480]  And we haven't heard of any, as far as I know, any major outbreaks as a result.
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:40.080]  But still, I just think it's, he didn't read the room right.
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:44.960]  And neither did the, you know, the studio.
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:48.320]  And I just think they should have, they should have postponed it if they really wanted to
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:50.160]  make it a theatrical thing until next year.
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:53.920]  Trenton Larkin It's hard to imagine a movie that's more in my wheelhouse. I would go see,
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:56.960]  I remember, I had a friend years ago.
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:00.160]  I mean, this is back in the late 90s, because it was when he was still alive.
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:05.760]  But somebody was talking about when Eyes Wide Shut was was announced and was coming out.
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:08.880]  And somebody was like, I don't know, that one doesn't sound interesting to me.
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:12.880]  And my one friend said, I would, if somebody said Kubrick made a movie about paint drying,
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:14.880]  I would go, I would go buy a ticket.
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:18.240]  And I was like, yeah, you just trust, you know, Christopher Nolan, you know, his new
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:19.760]  movie paint drying on a wall.
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:21.600]  I would watch it because I bet it'd be good.
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:23.520]  I don't know why.
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:24.480]  I don't know what hand.
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:27.760]  Brian Feroldi Not only that, you know, it's going to be great in the theater, because
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:31.280]  he does legitimately care about this more than anyone cares about sound.
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:35.840]  He does the, I met he just filming on IMAX cameras, like he cares about this to the utmost
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:37.920]  of anyone, obviously.
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:41.680]  And so you can understand why he doesn't want to launch it on one of the streaming services,
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:48.480]  or direct to, you know, direct to iTunes, and all the PVOD services.
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:52.800]  But again, just postpone it then, like everyone else is doing till next year.
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:56.240]  Trenton Larkin Which was the Batman that was like, partially
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:56.960]  IMAX.
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:58.240]  I think it was the second one.
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:00.960]  I actually did the Dark Knight or no dark.
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:02.160]  Brian Feroldi Oh, yeah, right.
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:07.200]  Yeah, they had a few scenes in the Dark Knight that were shot exclusively for IMAX.
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:07.840]  Trenton Larkin Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:13.040]  And my son and I went to see it at the Franklin Institute here in Philadelphia, where their
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:15.840]  IMAX screen is the real IMAX.
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:17.840]  And it was sort of a weird experience.
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:20.800]  So we saw that one twice in the theaters, we saw it in a regular theater, and then we
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:22.400]  went to see it in the IMAX.
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:23.920]  I guess we went to IMAX first.
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:31.600]  And it takes a little bit of time to get used to it's sort of like, like, maybe like if
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:37.360]  you like, went back in time and brought Thomas Jefferson to the modern day and showed him
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:42.880]  a movie and you know, it might take him a while for his brain to handle seeing a motion
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:45.840]  picture on a hundred foot screen.
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:52.480]  It's like seeing Batman on a real IMAX screen took some time for your brain to process but
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:54.720]  then once you got into it, it was amazing.
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:55.520]  It really was.
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:56.640]  Brian Feroldi So immersive.
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:01.600]  It's so I saw Interstellar twice in IMAX because it's like it was the most immersive.
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:04.880]  They've shot a huge percentage of that in with IMAX cameras.
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:08.640]  And I mean, yeah, it's like one of the most immersive experiences I've ever had.
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:09.040]  Trenton Larkin Right.
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:15.840]  And and he's a huge speaking of Kubrick, Christopher Nolan is big Kubrick fan and in fact supervised
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:22.560]  the last cleanup of 2001, which actually I didn't even I didn't realize that.
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:23.060]  Yeah.
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:25.760]  In terms of like the color correction and stuff.
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:27.200]  Yeah, keep it the way it should be.
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:33.440]  And we saw that I took my son I had been holding out on letting him see 2001 until he could
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:34.240]  see it in the theater.
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:36.000]  And we went to see it on an IMAX screen.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:41.760]  And you know, it was shot 70 millimeter, but the and we went to see it on a regular IMAX
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:42.560]  movie screen.
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:46.320]  But that's the point of 70 millimeter is that you can show it big.
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:47.280]  Yeah, it looks huge.
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:47.780]  Good.
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:52.640]  And that's what I that's what's showing it on a digital production projection of it on
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:55.760]  an IMAX screen does is it just it's big.
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:58.480]  And there is I'm a big believer in this.
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:37:59.200]  I really do.
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:06.560]  There's a psychological effect of seeing something big that your brain knows is big.
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:11.360]  You know, it's a giant 200 foot screen or however big the screen is.
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:15.520]  That is more than just the effect of field of view.
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:15.840]  Right.
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:20.480]  And like the most profound way of doing it is you can hold the phone close enough to
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:23.040]  your eyes to fill a movie theater.
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:23.200]  Right.
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:25.360]  To be bigger than the equivalent of that.
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:26.080]  Right.
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:27.520]  It's more than that, you know.
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:33.360]  And and having a nice big 70 inch TV in your house and sitting close to it, it still is
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:37.440]  not the same psychological effect of something that your brain knows is big.
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:39.920]  It's more the field of view doesn't explain it all.
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:43.280]  I'll give you two other sides to that.
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:47.360]  One is that the other thing that I think about a lot and what I really miss about movie theaters
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:49.520]  and we can get into movie theaters themselves in a second.
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:56.000]  But I also just think a big part of it is is you yourself knowing that you're not going
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.680]  to check your phone during it and knowing that everyone around you is not going to check
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:00.400]  your phone during it.
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:00.880]  Yeah.
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:03.040]  You're all fully immersed in the same experience.
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:03.280]  Yep.
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:06.480]  And I think that that's like it seems like a subtle distinction, but I think that that's
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:07.520]  a really important one.
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:08.880]  Yeah.
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:12.960]  The other thing as a brief aside, I would I would say one the most recent time I saw
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:17.840]  2001, we actually saw it with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:19.360]  It's an amazing experience.
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:22.320]  I don't know if you've ever done that where you go and see a movie with the orchestra.
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:28.000]  So I've seen now I've seen 2001, I've seen Breakfast at Tiffany's in London with with
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:28.960]  the orchestra there.
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:32.640]  And then I've seen Batman, the Tim Burton Batman.
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:35.360]  All three are amazing.
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:40.320]  If you can see them in that regard, they you know, obviously the the audio is the key part
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:40.640]  of that.
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:42.320]  They bring down a big screen.
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:44.960]  You know, it's not an IMAX screen, but it's a big, nice, nice screen.
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:46.480]  And that's great.
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:51.520]  But seeing it with a 2001 was was quite the experience, as you might imagine.
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:54.560]  So I highly recommend that if they if they ever do something like that near you.
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:59.840]  We almost went to see the Empire Strikes Back that way and something fell through because
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:03.440]  it's the sort of thing where it's like they don't do it every day for a month.
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:05.440]  It's like special, you know, special engagement.
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:06.720]  We had like some kind of conflict.
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:07.680]  I really wanted to.
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:10.160]  I'm sure it would be immersive.
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:12.320]  The the Batman IMAX thing.
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:13.520]  It was so immersive.
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:15.040]  Immersive is just the best way to put it.
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:17.760]  And I know it sounds like a catchphrase.
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:18.880]  It's hype or whatever.
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:24.400]  But it was like, man, when when Batman jumped off that building to in Hong Kong to like
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:29.200]  crash through the window and and take that guy back to back to Gotham City.
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:39.120]  I mean, it was more immersive than like Disney rides where they blow wind on you and do and
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:42.880]  play, you know, pump smells into the air and stuff.
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:43.440]  All that.
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:45.920]  But that's sort of I love all that for Disney, too.
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:47.920]  But it was just purely visual.
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:49.520]  No wind, no smell.
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:54.640]  But there was like a like a palm sweatiness, you know, like, oh, my God.
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:59.040]  One of the best ones I've seen of that is actually not a Christopher Nolan one.
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:00.640]  It was Mission Impossible.
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:01.840]  One of the Mission Impossibles.
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:02.800]  It wasn't the most recent one.
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:04.800]  I think it was two or three ago.
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:09.360]  It's the one where they're at the Burj Khalifa, you know, the world's tallest building.
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:09.760]  Yes.
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:10.320]  Yes.
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:11.840]  That's the one Brad Bird directed.
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:13.120]  Yes, it is.
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:13.520]  That's right.
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:15.040]  Brad Bird, Pixar.
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:15.360]  Yes.
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:16.240]  Famous Pixar director.
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:19.520]  So there's a scene where they're outside.
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:26.240]  Tom Cruise is walking outside and, you know, is about to walk scale down the side of the
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:27.440]  tallest building in the world.
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:30.640]  And right when that happens, they do this brilliant thing where if you're seeing it
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:34.640]  on IMAX, they just open up the field of view to full IMAX scale.
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:35.840]  And you're just looking down.
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:39.360]  And I mean, it's an incredible experience when you first see that.
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:40.080]  Yeah.
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:41.200]  Oh, man.
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:43.040]  So anyway, I'm a big believer in it.
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:45.600]  So I hold Tenet till next year.
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:46.880]  I could see doing it.
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:47.600]  I'm glad.
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:49.520]  And, you know, so what's up my wheel?
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:52.000]  I'm a huge fan of my favorite directors.
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:55.520]  Like there are certain directors who once you're on my list, I'll watch anything.
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:57.440]  I just don't even don't show me the preview.
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:41:58.480]  Don't show me the trailer.
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:02.080]  I'm in, you know, the new Sofia Coppola movie.
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:02.960]  Yeah.
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:03.840]  The Bill Murray one.
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:04.080]  Yeah.
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:04.640]  That's great.
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:04.960]  Yeah.
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:08.960]  Did you even before you told me Bill Murray's in it, though, you tell me Sofia Coppola made
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:09.680]  a new movie.
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:10.240]  I'm in line.
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:14.000]  Christopher Nolan.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:14.640]  I'm in line.
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:16.000]  A spy movie?
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:19.600]  Typical Nolan-esque time twisting.
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:20.000]  Stop.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:20.800]  Stop telling me.
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:21.600]  I'm in line.
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:22.560]  I dissolved.
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:27.840]  You know, I cannot wait for the new James Bond movie.
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:29.040]  I cannot wait.
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:35.760]  I really kind of feel like they went off the rails with Sam Mendes a little bit where it's,
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:40.640]  you know, we could do a whole podcast about what I think is wrong with Skyfall and Spectre.
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:45.200]  And I always mispronounce his name.
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:50.480]  What's his Koji Fukunawa, the guy who's directed the new Bond movie.
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:50.960]  Yeah, the...
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:56.000]  Kari Kojifukunawa.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:01.440]  I will screw it up, too, but famously did True Detective season one.
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:03.440]  Which was amazing.
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:05.600]  Speaking of HBO, right?
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:05.920]  Yes.
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:06.240]  Right.
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:08.800]  Yeah, totally one of the best ever that season one.
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:16.240]  Yeah, and in terms of having multiple hour-long episodes that are just there to serve the
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:20.880]  point of something that happens in episode six, man, oh, man.
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:23.920]  But they postponed.
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:27.120]  They were supposed to open last spring, postponed till November.
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:28.800]  November is obviously not going to happen.
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:29.520]  We already know that.
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:32.000]  So they've already said, oh, we'll go to next spring.
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.080]  I feel like Tenet should have done that.
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:36.720]  I really do.
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:45.440]  They absolutely should have, and all these movies that I think it speaks to sort of where
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:50.640]  we're headed with movies in general as well, because as has been the trend for a long time,
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:56.640]  there's now these tentpole movies, the Christopher Nolan prominent example, James Bond movies,
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:43:59.360]  obviously tentpole movies that are going to be in theaters.
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:03.920]  And now we're seeing more and more movies because of the result of COVID and everything
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:04.480]  that's happened.
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:08.560]  There's now these like other tier of movies, which are still great movies, which can go
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:11.200]  straight to streaming and can go straight to the living room.
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:13.360]  They don't necessarily need to be seen.
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:15.280]  The directors may want them to be seen, and that's fine.
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:20.960]  I think it should be at their discretion for a high-profile enough director, I would say.
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:26.640]  But even like, look, Martin Scorsese put The Irishman with Netflix, and his new movie is
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:28.240]  going to be that way too, it sounds like, right?
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:28.800]  I think with Apple.
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:29.440]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:38.720]  And so it just feels like we're heading to a world where it seems inevitable that a bunch
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:41.760]  of smaller movies go direct to streaming.
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:44.720]  The movies, like one of my favorite movies is a movie called Michael Clayton.
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:45.440]  I don't know if you've seen it.
[01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:47.200]  Yes, many times.
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:48.400]  It's a great movie.
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:52.080]  It's something, though, that would never, it seems like it would never be a theatrical
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:55.680]  movie, maybe because of George Clooney, because he's still a big enough star that he would
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:56.400]  be a big star.
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:01.120]  Maybe because of George Clooney, because he's still a big enough star that he would basically
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:02.080]  drive people to theaters.
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:04.400]  But it didn't do all that well, I think, when it was in theaters.
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:09.280]  But it's the type of movie that probably would be a Netflix or an Apple TV Plus movie
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:10.000]  these days, right?
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:13.360]  So you're going to have those types of movies which go to streaming.
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:15.120]  We're going to have the big tent poles which go.
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:18.720]  And obviously, Disney is the preeminent example of all those tent poles.
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:21.520]  Every Disney movie is basically a tent pole movie at this point.
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:26.800]  And so I wonder if we don't get back to the world where, because of what unfortunately
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:33.840]  has happened to the movie theaters, with Regal now reshutting down everything, and AMC, the
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:38.400]  biggest one, striking deals with Paramount to try to make some money on the side.
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:42.720]  If it doesn't just go back to the world, which is one of the original antitrust things, where
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:45.680]  the theaters end up being owned by studios again.
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:50.160]  Doesn't it make sense for Disney to own its own studios now and basically have that as
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:51.440]  part of the product offerings?
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:56.160]  So they have Disney Plus, and then maybe they offer it in theaters as well for the biggest
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:56.640]  movies.
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:00.880]  Yeah, and if you already subscribe to Disney Plus, you can show your phone, maybe get in
[01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:03.360]  free or discounted or something like that.
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:05.840]  Right, or some sort of upsell like they did with Mulan.
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:12.320]  And yeah, I think that that's the world that we're going to see much faster as a result
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:14.720]  of the COVID situation than we had previously.
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:18.320]  Because I love going to movie theaters, and I want them to exist.
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:21.920]  Some of the best movie theaters in the world are some of the great experiences in the world.
[01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:26.000]  There's this place in London that I used to love to go to called Electric Cinema.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.520]  There's a few of them, but there's one in Notting Hill in particular that people who
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:31.280]  hear this who have been there will know what I'm talking about.
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:35.280]  It's a one-screen, amazing experience theater.
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:36.480]  Those are the greatest things in the world.
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:38.240]  The Alamo Drafthouse is a great theater.
[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:40.240]  The AMC is the world's are not great theaters.
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:43.280]  And I think we're all okay if there's fewer of those.
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:47.920]  But I think that we can recreate a world now from the ground up where the theatrical experience
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:50.400]  is like a more magical thing across the board again.
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:50.640]  Yeah.
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:59.680]  And it speaks to, and again, not to put on a free enterprise at all costs hat, but it
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:06.560]  speaks to the way that regulation gets so caught up in current events, and then it lasts
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:07.040]  forever.
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:08.800]  It was news to me.
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:14.400]  I'm a nerd for the entertainment industry, and I sort of follow politics.
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:16.560]  And it was news to me.
[01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:23.520]  I didn't know until like at some point this year in the context of the danger of theater
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:30.640]  change going completely bankrupt in COVID that it's illegal for the studios to own their
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:31.280]  own theaters.
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:37.680]  Yeah, the Paramount Decree, which they just are making changes to right now so that we
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:39.600]  will be able to go back to that world.
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:44.000]  Because to your point, it may have made sense, you know, in 1940 or 70 years ago.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:44.320]  Right.
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:48.560]  It does not make sense anymore because the world is just totally different now.
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:52.960]  And in fact, that may end up being the savior of many of these movie theaters.
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:58.560]  You know, Netflix has already bought a couple theaters, and I think Disney and the other
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:03.040]  studios are going to be in the same position to do that as just another offering in their
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:03.840]  sort of tool belt.
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:12.080]  And I always call it a usual suspects moment where it's that the denouement and usual
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:17.840]  suspects where the detective figures out, you know, again, without spoiling it.
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:20.400]  Everybody who's seen it knows what I'm talking about.
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:25.200]  And there's this moment where he drops his coffee cup and it's like, oh, and you it's
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:27.920]  so great because you in the audience are like, no.
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:29.840]  Oh, yeah.
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:31.040]  Right.
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:33.200]  And I love those moments.
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:38.080]  But there was this thing to go back in Disney lore at the tail end of the Michael Eisner
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:39.280]  era in the 90s.
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.440]  Disney had this plan.
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:46.080]  I forget what they were called, but they were going to build these entertainment complexes
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:48.880]  in cities instead of theme parks.
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:52.560]  It was like their next instead of building a new theme park in Orlando or something like
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:57.280]  that, our new Disneyland in another country somewhere around the world, they were going
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:48:58.320]  to build these things.
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:01.280]  And one of the places they were going to build it was here in Philadelphia.
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:03.600]  And there was a it's a great location.
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:06.240]  It was like right here in Center City, Philadelphia.
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:12.320]  And it was on the spot of what used to be like 100 years ago, one of the big department
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:15.360]  stores and long ago was destroyed.
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:19.920]  And it was just it's a prime spot of real estate right on Market Street.
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:22.160]  Just couldn't find a better spot.
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:26.800]  That was literally not a parking garage, just a parking lot.
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:28.800]  Prime real estate.
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:33.360]  It's like it's like things that happen in Philadelphia that would never happen in Manhattan
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:35.840]  is just prime real estate as a parking lot.
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:42.160]  But because it used to be a building, it had a like a basement.
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:44.320]  And so the parking garage was built on top of this.
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:45.360]  It was hollow.
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:49.200]  And every couple of years, it would it was like a sinkhole waiting to happen.
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:50.720]  It was like I wouldn't park my car there.
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:52.320]  That lot is concave.
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:53.200]  It looked like a bowl.
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:58.000]  But they were they didn't want to do anything like put any more permanent there because
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.920]  they just kept thinking somebody's going to buy it.
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:03.840]  And Disney was going to buy it and spend billions of dollars to make this entertainment complex
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:05.280]  never came to fruition.
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:08.080]  But the plan never included movie theaters.
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:09.840]  And I always thought that was weird.
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:10.960]  And right.
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:12.000]  Of all the things.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:16.480]  Yeah, it was like they're going to have laser guns, you know, like laser guns and other
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:18.880]  stuff and all sorts of interactive stuff.
[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:19.760]  But no movie theater.
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:20.640]  I was like, that's crazy.
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:24.240]  There's a need in Center City, Philly for great movie theaters.
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:25.360]  In fact, they did.
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:27.760]  It's so tragic because it opened right before COVID.
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:32.400]  They did actually there is a new movie theater in downtown Philadelphia, very close to the
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:34.160]  spot where Disney was going to build this.
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:37.040]  But it turns out it's like my usual suspect moment.
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:41.280]  Oh, they weren't going to put movie theaters in because that would have been illegal, which
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:42.080]  is crazy.
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:47.920]  You could build like laser tag and indoor roller coasters and other things.
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:50.480]  But you can't have a movie theater because you're a movie studio.
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:54.480]  I like the idea of them building that in secret and then at the grand opening them taking
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:56.080]  away like Michael Eisner in handcuffs.
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:01.600]  Yeah, because you build a movie theater to show the Lion King or whatever.
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:08.720]  Yeah, well, speaking of theaters and people being in a room together, Apple has an event
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:10.880]  next week as we speak.
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:13.600]  They're calling it high comma speed.
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:19.680]  And it again, for obvious reasons, will not be held in an actual theater.
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:20.560]  It'll be remote.
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:24.400]  And I guess we can wrap up by talking about what we expect to see.
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:29.760]  Yeah, so this is obviously event number two.
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:33.520]  I'm curious if this is the last one, if this is going to be everything.
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:34.560]  And we'll get to that in a second.
[01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:38.800]  But obviously it is the iPhone event, but there the naming of it, right?
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:45.200]  There's always these Zapruder film like analysis of the invite and what it means.
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:46.160]  The name is interesting.
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:52.720]  It does seem like, you know, given what the rumors have been that there's some element
[01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:58.320]  of it being a pun on maybe the high speeds of the phones, but also like the look of it
[01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:00.000]  as sort of HomePod-esque, right?
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:05.280]  And like the rumor that there would be a new HomePod device with concentric circles showing
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.200]  the audio element of it.
[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:10.160]  But is there something else to that?
[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:12.480]  Is it Apple chips, silicon chips?
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:13.680]  Is it something else?
[01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:18.560]  It's funny because my take was I don't think there's much to read into on this invitation.
[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:19.920]  Yeah, I saw that.
[01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:20.480]  Right.
[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:24.480]  And because everything could be, speed is like the easiest thing to talk about.
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:25.920]  Everything is always getting faster.
[01:52:25.920 --> 01:52:26.640]  They're computers.
[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:31.120]  So it's, to me, it's sort of a blank slate that they could, they could have used this
[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:32.720]  invitation and title last year.
[01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:34.160]  They could have used it five years ago.
[01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:37.440]  They could write five years from now, but you tell people that.
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:38.960]  And it's part of the reason I do it.
[01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:40.320]  Here's it'll insider secret.
[01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:45.440]  If you're listening to the show is I like to do that to hear because the best way to
[01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:49.360]  get people's theories on what it means is to tell them you don't think it means anything.
[01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:50.820]  Right.
[01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:55.280]  So there's people, I mean, there are people who are willing to like bet their mortgage
[01:52:55.280 --> 01:52:56.960]  that it's about five G.
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:02.000]  There are people who think it means that the Apple Silicon max are coming and they're
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:03.200]  going to be super fast.
[01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:12.080]  The latency, the latency of a home pod audio responses with the voice assistant.
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:13.380]  Yeah.
[01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:15.280]  What about high fidelity?
[01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:15.920]  Yeah.
[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:16.400]  Yeah.
[01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:21.760]  Cause it's so people think it's any and all of those things I could be, I just don't feel
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:27.840]  like the, the, the, uh, Oh, and somebody who, somebody thinks that it's the, um, cause there
[01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:34.960]  are rumors that Apple has, while they scrapped the charging pad, you know, the air power
[01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:40.000]  and I'm sure they won't use, reuse the name, but that they haven't given up on their own
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:42.640]  wireless charging thing.
[01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:47.440]  And that it might be, that might be power, you know, they might, those, those circles
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:52.080]  might symbolize the power coming out of a wireless charging pad.
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:57.120]  Um, and they, and they look a bit like the air tags, which is sort of like visually,
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:53:57.600]  right?
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:53:58.080]  Right.
[01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:02.720]  And maybe they're with the air tags where you find your devices that you put the tags
[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:09.200]  on, um, that, that those are like radar waves to show, who knows, it could be any or all
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:09.440]  of that.
[01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:10.000]  It doesn't matter.
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:16.080]  But you know, I feel like, who knows, uh, what we do know obviously is it's the iPhone
[01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:22.560]  event, uh, and it seems pretty well established what the iPhones are going to be, you know,
[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:28.080]  at this point, obviously the 5g element is the key portion of it, but also they're moving
[01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:31.760]  to sort of the different sizes, three different sizes potentially.
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:34.960]  And will, are they actually, do you think they're actually going to call one of them
[01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:35.760]  the iPhone mini?
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:44.480]  Maybe I actually feel like that passes the sniff test and the names typically don't leak.
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:50.880]  I know, uh, I think Gurman got the iPhone 10 name.
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:52.800]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:53.280]  Right.
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:58.080]  And I, you know, lost, I, as I often do, you know, uh, lose my bets.
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:02.080]  I thought, well, if that's really the name or maybe Gurman didn't get the name, maybe
[01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:06.080]  the name iPhone with a capital X came out of the, a software leak.
[01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:06.880]  Maybe that was Steven.
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:10.480]  I think it was, I think it was leaked somewhere in software.
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:10.800]  Yeah.
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:11.200]  Yeah.
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:11.520]  All right.
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:12.240]  I take it back.
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:17.760]  So with the iPhone 10, it was a software leak that, but all we knew because it was a status
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:18.160]  is right.
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:19.600]  It was because it was a software leak.
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:21.440]  We only knew the way it was typed.
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:24.640]  You know, I found it was the X a placeholder for something else.
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:31.600]  Was it a placeholder or was it a 10 Roman numerals or was it an X like Xbox?
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:36.720]  And I thought for sure it would be an X like Xbox if that's really the name, because I
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:40.880]  so hate my hatred of Roman numerals is so profound that I couldn't believe they would
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:47.760]  do it again after finally getting away from iPhone, Mac OS 10, which stuck them with this
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:50.800]  weird version number for 20 years.
[01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:54.240]  And everyone's saying OS X who doesn't know.
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:54.720]  Right.
[01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:56.240]  Everybody's saying it wrong anyway.
[01:55:56.240 --> 01:55:57.200]  That was my argument.
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:02.560]  My argument was everybody said it wrong for 15 years and they just got away from it.
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:07.920]  They're going to call it the iPhone X and Gurman predicted, no, I think it'll be 10
[01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:11.200]  because it's the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and he was right.
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:21.680]  Names tend not to leak because that group gets to keep them and they even print.
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:28.240]  I honestly think it's an anti-secrecy measure that when you buy a new iPhone, the box just
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:34.240]  says iPhone because they put these boxes in the back of your iPhone.
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:36.400]  Now it doesn't even say anything.
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:38.000]  Now it just has an Apple logo.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:42.720]  It doesn't even say iPhone anymore, but they always used to just say iPhone on the phone
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:45.360]  instead of saying like iPhone, whatever.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:46.240]  Right.
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:50.400]  And so instead what leaks is that the model like a one, five, six, three, whatever.
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:50.800]  Right.
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:53.760]  But this iPhone mini name has leaked.
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:57.120]  I believe it because they've stuck with mini for smaller.
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:03.920]  It will be the smallest of the new iPhones, you know, and again, without getting out or
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:09.040]  rulers and doing it, but the basic idea is that compared to last year, there will still
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:12.960]  be two pro models, a smaller one and a bigger one, I guess called Max.
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:16.560]  And then there'll be the regular one that's just called iPhone.
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:18.880]  That's cheaper and is made of aluminum.
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:22.960]  And now that cheaper one will have a smaller sibling.
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:26.480]  I believe that they would call that one the mini because it might be the main selling
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:30.560]  point of it is, you know, if you want a smaller iPhone, here it is.
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:34.720]  And they also, it still allows them to have the SE to our earlier points, right?
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:39.520]  Like you can still have the SE because people, you know, at first associated the SE as being
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:43.280]  sort of the mini iPhone, but that was never clearly now the intention of it.
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:46.560]  And so they can, they can remain with that.
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:50.640]  Like, like we talked about this sort of two year cycle for those and then do the mini
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:55.120]  as the actual small version of the phone, which is, which is sort of funny because it's
[01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:58.800]  obviously going to be far bigger than like the original iPhone.
[01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:02.560]  But compared to the other ones, it's going to be pretty small, especially compared to
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:06.240]  what this, this new rumored biggest one is going to be the, you know, the biggest one ever.
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:06.720]  Right.
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:08.080]  Which is just gigantic.
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:11.200]  It's going to be like the size of, I don't know, the size of a MacBook.
[01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:13.440]  Yeah.
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:20.080]  My wife has the iPhone 11 Pro Max and every time I pick up her phone, like she'll be
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:21.680]  like, Hey, can you bring my phone up?
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:22.560]  Or, you know, whatever.
[01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:24.880]  Every single time I pick it up, I'm like, this is so big.
[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:26.560]  That's what I have too.
[01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:30.000]  And I often think about sort of downsizing.
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:36.160]  Um, but, uh, if for a while, obviously the camera element was the big selling point,
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:37.920]  but now those are at parody.
[01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:41.040]  Um, and I don't think, I don't think anything is rumored, right.
[01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:47.200]  To be bigger, to be better, uh, beyond the screen size about the new max versus the regular
[01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:48.000]  pro models.
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:48.560]  Is that right?
[01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:51.280]  Uh, I don't, I think so.
[01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:51.600]  Yeah.
[01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:52.080]  It's unclear.
[01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:55.040]  There's like a lot of talk about the promotion, right.
[01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:59.360]  Screen, uh, and they may not do that even though it's been on the iPad for a while.
[01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:04.640]  Um, but seemingly it'll just be all the pro models have the five G there's one that's
[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:05.360]  slightly bigger.
[01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:07.200]  That's, that's the max version.
[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:12.000]  Um, they all have the same chip and, uh, you know, maybe it in the past, I think one of
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.400]  them might've had slightly more Ram, I think too.
[01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:15.760]  Um, but they never talked about that.
[01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:16.240]  Obviously.
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:17.280]  And there's some spec.
[01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:22.560]  I'm less interested in what the rumors, what the leakers say and more interested in just
[01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:26.480]  playing the, what, what might be coming just because we're going to find out anyway.
[01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:32.560]  But I think that the rumor mill, the leaker mill is that only the max is going to have
[01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:38.320]  a certain form of five G networking, which seems really weird to me.
[01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:39.040]  Yeah.
[01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:43.280]  Um, but that it is more, it takes up more space and therefore it's the only one with
[01:59:43.280 --> 01:59:44.160]  the room for it.
[01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:51.360]  Um, but I, to me, the five G thing, it always puts Apple in a weird spot when they go through
[01:59:51.360 --> 01:59:51.920]  these things.
[01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:56.480]  So the first one, when they went from edge to three G was easy because edge was really,
[01:59:56.480 --> 01:59:57.200]  really slow.
[01:59:57.200 --> 02:00:00.720]  I mean, like in hindsight, ridiculously slow.
[02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:01.680]  Um, right.
[02:00:01.680 --> 02:00:05.840]  And everyone was on them that they, you know, there was already three G available, but they
[02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:06.640]  weren't using it.
[02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:07.600]  And so, yeah, right.
[02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:12.480]  And you know, one year or two years, I guess it was two years before they came out.
[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:13.120]  No, one year.
[02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:14.080]  It was only one year, one year.
[02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:15.680]  Cause they skipped, there was no iPhone two.
[02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:16.080]  Right, right.
[02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:17.040]  Right to iPhone three G.
[02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:25.760]  Right. Uh, and then when they went from three G to LTE, it, it definitely, I mean, and there
[02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:30.880]  still is a switch in settings to turn off LTE because you know, why did, why weren't
[02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:32.960]  they the first ones to jump on LTE?
[02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:38.240]  Well, it doesn't make any sense because the first ones, like there've been five G phones
[02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:40.320]  for well over a year on the market.
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:47.200]  Um, but when a new network technology rolls out, it takes a long time to roll out everywhere.
[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:49.600]  The first chips aren't the most efficient.
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:53.120]  They're battery, you know, they, they, they consume a lot of energy.
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:59.360]  And, um, there's a reason why when we went from three G to LTE, I, I turned off the LTE
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:00.240]  for a long time.
[02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:04.320]  I, I, you know, because it was, it was like, I wasn't getting faster speeds and I was
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:08.960]  definitely losing battery life and I'd turn it off and just use three G.
[02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:11.920]  And I didn't notice a speed difference in the real world.
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:13.760]  And my battery lasted longer.
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:19.120]  I wouldn't be surprised if we wind up in a similar situation where five G for a lot of
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:22.240]  people in a lot of places, maybe doesn't do them anything.
[02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:26.560]  And the other weird thing about five G for Apple is it's not really their feature.
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:29.120]  It's a network feature and other phones have it.
[02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:33.360]  So however fast five G is, it's not iPhone specific.
[02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:38.080]  It applies to any phone on the same network with the same five G carrier.
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:39.440]  Right.
[02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:40.960]  I, I agree with all of that.
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:44.800]  Obviously some of the early tests, you know, like it's rolled out in places in San
[02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:45.440]  Francisco.
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:48.960]  I don't have any of the devices, but the early tests are like, you know, they're good.
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:49.520]  They're not great.
[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:50.400]  They're not that much better.
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:55.920]  In some cases they're worse than, than what we have right now with, with LTE or whatever
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:02:02.320]  five GE, whatever bullshit AT&T uses to name it.
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:05.200]  But yeah, I mean, I think that that's right.
[02:02:05.200 --> 02:02:09.200]  That's why it's you know, it's always the question of when Apple will actually do this.
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:14.320]  And it feels like, it feels like there was some pressure maybe to do it you know, this
[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:20.960]  year instead of waiting another year you know, pressure on, on the sales of you know,
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:22.880]  potential, potentially the iPhone.
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:27.360]  But I don't know that it's going to be vital for another year to really have it.
[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:30.000]  And that that'll make that big of a difference to people.
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:30.320]  Yeah.
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:34.320]  And maybe, but maybe that's the way it goes where you kind of have to roll it out at a
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:38.880]  certain point, you know, and, and again, we don't talk about the carriers anywhere near
[02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:42.960]  as much as we did 10 years ago in the early years of iPhone when they were more dominant
[02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:47.760]  and we were more used to, I mean, in the early years of the iPhone, it wasn't until the
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:51.200]  iPhone four that they were even on more than one carrier in the United States.
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:55.440]  And it wasn't even the main, it was a special edition of the iPhone four that came out in
[02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:56.160]  February.
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:56.640]  Yeah.
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:02:58.800]  I remember going to the Verizon event in New York.
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:02:59.440]  Right there.
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:04.480]  And I, it was the first, that was, I remember specifically cause it was the first Apple
[02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:06.400]  product I got as a review unit.
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:08.240]  It was the Verizon iPhone four.
[02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:14.320]  You know, it, so it was a couple of years before they were even on more than one network.
[02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:20.400]  We're, we're away from the idea that then the carriers tell us why to buy new phones,
[02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:20.800]  right?
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:22.400]  I mean, it's just not how we think about it.
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:26.880]  They're just, you know, it's just give me, give me, give me upstream and downstream.
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:27.280]  That's it.
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:28.400]  Right.
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:33.040]  So here, here's an interesting tangent off of that for you which relates to one thing
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:35.280]  that they may or may not talk about here.
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:41.440]  Do you think that they'll do a Mac book with their own Silicon with 5g?
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:46.320]  I think they might, and it might be why they've been waiting.
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:49.680]  It just seems so weird that they haven't done that.
[02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:53.200]  And I, I agree.
[02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:54.320]  You talk to people about it.
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:59.040]  They almost uniformly say that it has much more to do with the operating system than
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:03:59.920]  anything else, right?
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:06.240]  Like that OS 10 previously and Mac OS now just wasn't geared to do that.
[02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:08.320]  And you see it when you were like tethered.
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:14.400]  I, there were many times when I've been tethered to a, like a Mifi device and I wake up and
[02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:18.800]  I look at how much data is used and it's like 10 gigabytes overnight because it was doing
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:19.760]  all this stuff in the background.
[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:20.160]  Right.
[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:27.200]  And it just isn't, I remember Marco Arment years and years ago was, I think it was a
[02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:32.080]  WWDC and the hotel wifi was terrible.
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:36.400]  So he tethered, left his Mac connected overnight and woke up in the morning and used up his
[02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:43.280]  entire connection because his Mac had like downloaded a bunch of like iTunes shows and
[02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:45.120]  it's like, Oh, well your Mac didn't know.
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:47.200]  Your Mac is just like, Oh, I've got a network connection.
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:49.360]  Well, there's a new episode of Mad Men.
[02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:49.840]  Here we go.
[02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:50.240]  Here you go.
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:50.880]  Here it is.
[02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:51.600]  Ready for you.
[02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:52.400]  High def even.
[02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:54.320]  And it was like, no, I didn't want you to do that.
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:55.600]  Those episodes cost $10,000.
[02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:56.800]  Enjoy.
[02:04:57.680 --> 02:04:59.360]  I don't know how you solve that.
[02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:03.440]  And you know, again, it's just simple, basic things we've been talking about forever and
[02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:04.720]  we all know it's true.
[02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:09.680]  You know, that apps on the Mac, if you have them running, they're just running.
[02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:11.600]  It doesn't matter if you're looking at them or not.
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:17.840]  And on iPads and iPhones back being in the background means something very different
[02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:20.080]  than just is the window front most.
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:26.000]  You don't accidentally download, you know, gigabytes of stuff in the background on your
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.320]  phone other than weird cases where there's bugs.
[02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:32.800]  I know, please don't don't tell me about the time that you, I know it happens and I'm very
[02:05:32.800 --> 02:05:34.320]  sorry that you got a bill for it, but.
[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:38.240]  And so we haven't seen anything like that in Big Sur, right?
[02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:42.240]  Where there's like an indication that the apps in the background are changing in some
[02:05:42.240 --> 02:05:42.560]  way.
[02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:45.920]  Yeah, but I, yeah, but I think there are some APIs for that.
[02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:51.520]  There are, I think without going on a big tangent, I think there are some APIs for like
[02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:55.680]  Macs to have that sort of fine grain control and they could add it.
[02:05:55.680 --> 02:05:57.600]  So I wouldn't be surprised.
[02:05:57.600 --> 02:06:01.840]  And basically long story short with the, I don't think there's going to be, let's just
[02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:02.640]  cut to the chase.
[02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:05.600]  Do we think that the Apple Silicon Macs are coming next week?
[02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:07.440]  My answer is no, I don't think so.
[02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:12.080]  Um, I, well, I don't think they're coming next week.
[02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:14.000]  I think there's a chance they talk about it though.
[02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:17.920]  I think, I still think they're coming before the end of the year would be what I would
[02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:18.800]  bet on.
[02:06:18.800 --> 02:06:23.440]  The question then is, do they talk about it next week or do they have a third event?
[02:06:23.440 --> 02:06:27.280]  Because now we're in the world of virtual events where they're nice and not easy, but
[02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:30.320]  relatively easier to, to stage.
[02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:32.240]  Do they do one in November or something like that?
[02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:32.960]  That's what I think.
[02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:38.160]  And I know that our, you know, politely fun are, you know, remember when arguments were
[02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:39.920]  fun, this is a fun argument.
[02:06:39.920 --> 02:06:48.960]  It is, uh, Apple has had late November, early December of Mac press briefings for years
[02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:49.360]  now.
[02:06:49.360 --> 02:06:55.840]  Like the last year they did the brand new 16 inch Mac book pro with the fixed keyboard
[02:06:57.040 --> 02:06:58.080]  in December.
[02:06:58.080 --> 02:06:59.280]  Uh, that's right.
[02:06:59.280 --> 02:06:59.600]  Yeah.
[02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:09.280]  And the Mac pro launched in December and the hands on with the, uh, pro display XDR and
[02:07:09.280 --> 02:07:10.320]  the Mac pro.
[02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:15.600]  And the first time we got to see, we in the media got to see the Mac pro rack mounted.
[02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:18.400]  They didn't have that at WWDC when they announced it.
[02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:20.240]  That was all in a press brief.
[02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:21.280]  They didn't do an event.
[02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:23.360]  It wasn't at the Steve jobs theater.
[02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:27.840]  They might've had something in Cupertino for West coast media, but I went to the one in
[02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:28.320]  New York.
[02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:35.040]  Um, and there were a bunch of media there, you know, but it wasn't something for, it
[02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:36.320]  wasn't streamed to the public.
[02:07:36.320 --> 02:07:42.320]  There was no, you know, I, I, people who aren't in the media don't realize maybe that Apple
[02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:46.320]  does that because there wasn't a thing to watch if you were at home.
[02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:47.200]  Right, right, right.
[02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:52.960]  But they do put on a show or they did, and it was a thing that, you know, and Phil Schiller
[02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:53.440]  was there.
[02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:58.080]  I mean, you know, flew out from California to New York to be there to talk about this
[02:07:58.080 --> 02:07:58.400]  stuff.
[02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:02.800]  I mean, and John Ternus was there and you know, people who are, you know, leaders of
[02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:04.880]  the company were there to talk about the Mac pro again.
[02:08:04.880 --> 02:08:09.600]  And the year before was, I think when, or maybe it was two years ago when the iMac pro
[02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:11.200]  came out, that came out in December.
[02:08:11.920 --> 02:08:13.680]  So they do stuff in December.
[02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:22.400]  And I think especially now in 2020, there is no difference between a media briefing
[02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:26.800]  event and a full on keynote public event.
[02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:27.760]  Right, right.
[02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:31.200]  That's what I was going to say because they're not, they're obviously not going to do those,
[02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:34.720]  those types of behind closed doors media events just for safety reasons.
[02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:35.680]  So why not?
[02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:36.560]  So how do they do it?
[02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:41.440]  And it's just as easy, again, not easy, but just as seamless, I guess, to do it for the
[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:46.160]  whole public rather than would they just send a video to a handful of people like yourself
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:48.080]  or would they actually just release it to the public?
[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:55.840]  And I think that the mechanics of holding an actual event, even when it's not 300 people
[02:08:55.840 --> 02:09:05.040]  at the Steve Jobs Theater, even when it's 50 people in New York, or maybe 25 at a time
[02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:09.280]  for an hour, and then they leave and, you know, you're walking out, oh, there's Joanna
[02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:11.520]  Stern in the next group coming in, and hey, how you doing?
[02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:16.640]  And, you know, 25 people come in at 10 o'clock, and then another group comes in 11 o'clock.
[02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:23.600]  The mechanics of that are so complicated, just the, you know, flying people out from
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:29.120]  Cupertino to New York and hosting this and preparing it, that it makes more sense to
[02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:31.360]  put more into a single event.
[02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:37.280]  And for the ones that are the big keynotes, where they are going to say this is a keynote
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:42.320]  event on the Steve Jobs Theater and we're going to live stream this to the world, it
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:50.480]  makes more sense to do a two-hour keynote with two hours of stuff as opposed to doing
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:53.760]  it all twice and having two one-hour versions.
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:10:02.080]  Whereas with these purely remote, televised shows that just stream, it's the opposite.
[02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:08.560]  I think it makes way more sense to do two one-hour events than one two-hour event.
[02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:09.920]  Right.
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:16.080]  And they, I mean, we've gone from a world where everyone joked that these types of events
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:20.000]  were marketing for Apple to, like, they are actually a huge component of marketing for
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:24.400]  Apple now, that they're, you know, they can put them on nicely, anyone can watch them
[02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:25.280]  around the world.
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:29.920]  And so, you know, I think that that leads them to want to do, maybe not more of them,
[02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:34.400]  but just do them with less questions asked about it.
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:35.360]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:44.000]  And so I think just in general, it would make more sense to, I think the people who think
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:48.800]  they might cram every remaining announcement in the next Tuesday's event are thinking
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:50.720]  too much in terms of two-hour events.
[02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:55.440]  And I know in this specifically, people say, well, there's an, you know, an ICS file from
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:59.120]  Apple for the event where you can download it from the website to put it on your calendar.
[02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:00.480]  And it says it's two hours.
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:03.920]  The last one said it was two hours a month ago.
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:04.480]  It was only an hour.
[02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:05.280]  And it was only an hour.
[02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:09.440]  They just make it two hours because they're, in some sense, they're playing poker.
[02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:13.440]  You know, it's like when you have five cards in your hand, but the only three that matter
[02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:15.920]  is the three kings and the other two don't really matter.
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:20.080]  You don't say to your opponent, I only care about three of the cards in my hand.
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:22.800]  You're giving information away.
[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:26.640]  They're not going to set an event that says, you know, 55 minutes.
[02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:28.960]  They're just not going to, even if they knew it.
[02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:33.440]  And I really doubt that the people who make the website have any idea how long the event
[02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:33.760]  is going to be.
[02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:34.320]  Right, right.
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:39.040]  Though it is interesting that Apple knows, presumably right now, exactly how long it's
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:39.600]  going to run, right?
[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:40.480]  Because they already filmed it.
[02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:44.080]  Yeah, maybe they're still doing editing over the weekend, but still, like, they know roughly
[02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:44.960]  how long it's going to be.
[02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:50.480]  Yeah, I would guess that it's in the can or very, very close, you know, like, or it could,
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:53.840]  like, they could stream it right now, but maybe they're doing some final touches or
[02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:54.480]  something like that.
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:12:01.600]  I just think strategically, details of what they're going to announce aside, I just think
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:02.880]  it works better for them.
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:09.200]  It works better in every single way to do a one-hour event, mostly about iPhone next
[02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:15.280]  week, and then do a one-hour event after Thanksgiving, I guess.
[02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:18.720]  So, Thanksgiving, I looked, is late this year.
[02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:20.800]  It's the date is November 26.
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:25.680]  So, if they do a Mac event, it would either have to be the week before that.
[02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:26.480]  The first week of December.
[02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:29.360]  Yeah, but I think first week of December is way more.
[02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:33.040]  It would actually be Tuesday, December 1st, so it would literally be the first day of
[02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:33.520]  December.
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:37.760]  So, the other thing they could do then is, because they obviously, they still haven't
[02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:39.280]  launched Big Sur, right?
[02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:42.000]  And I don't think it's clear when it's coming.
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:42.720]  They said the fall.
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:46.880]  Did they say the fall, or did they say, I don't even know what, I don't remember what
[02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:47.280]  they said.
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:47.920]  They said fall.
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:53.200]  Okay, but that would be another way to show, because I'm just trying to think of, like,
[02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:57.360]  what, obviously it's a huge announcement, their own silicon, but they already did a
[02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:00.240]  lot of time, spent a lot of time on it during WWDC.
[02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:02.800]  So, like, what else did they do?
[02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:04.640]  Did they just do demos of it?
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:08.160]  Do they show off, you know, certain third-party apps that were ported?
[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:10.240]  I think that's pretty obvious.
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:14.240]  Do they do, but like, do they have enough there to do an hour event, I guess?
[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:17.360]  Or can it be a half an hour event, or is it something else?
[02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:23.760]  I think that they have successfully kept this very close to their vest.
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:28.320]  People don't seem to have any idea what Apple Silicon Macs are going to be like.
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:29.760]  I certainly don't, and it doesn't.
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:33.280]  Right, we don't even know which model it's going, like, the rumor is that it's a MacBook
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:33.760]  Pro.
[02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:39.040]  But there's been other rumors, too, in the past, that it was going to be a 12-inch MacBook,
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:41.360]  that it was going to be an iMac, yeah.
[02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:48.720]  Yeah, the 12-inch iMac, or not iMac, MacBook, seems like the most obvious one, because it
[02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:52.240]  was a product in their lineup, and some people really loved it.
[02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:55.360]  I still love it, I still have it, I still use that thing a ton.
[02:13:55.360 --> 02:14:00.000]  It's relatively slow now, because it's got old Intel chips, but it's a great form factor.
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:03.760]  Right, and keyboard socks, but it's a great form factor.
[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:08.160]  So there's a lot of people who know that it was a good product that was held back only
[02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:13.280]  by the speed of the Intel chips that had the thermal characteristics that the form factor
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:14.080]  demanded.
[02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:18.400]  And we know Apple has chips already that could make you happy with it.
[02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:24.800]  If they just put the internals of an iPad Pro in that, we'd be like, that's way faster
[02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:27.280]  than the MacBook they were selling.
[02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:33.040]  And so it just seems so obvious that they would do that and bring that form factor back
[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:36.160]  that people think it, because it doesn't really take much imagination.
[02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:42.400]  It's taking a form factor they already shipped for the Mac, and taking the chips they've
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:47.600]  already put in iPad Pros and just put them together, you know, just put your peanut butter
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:48.720]  tastes great with my chocolate.
[02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:51.440]  And they might make that product.
[02:14:51.440 --> 02:15:04.720]  But I think that they have such bigger plans for Apple Silicon Macs that, and I have to
[02:15:04.720 --> 02:15:09.040]  go back and rewatch it, but I remember, and I don't think people read it the right way.
[02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:17.600]  When they did that segment at WWDC, and they went to the gimmick in the show, Underground
[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:25.440]  Secret Lab, and Johnny Srouji was talking, what Johnny Srouji said, and I haven't rewatched
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:31.360]  it in a month, but the way I remember it was that he said, look, we've had this custom
[02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:34.800]  chip team that we started making custom chips for iPhones and iPads.
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:39.440]  And then we had to make them for Apple Watch.
[02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:41.040]  And that was an entirely new thing.
[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:45.120]  We had to make it so much smaller and so much more power efficient because it was so much,
[02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:47.520]  you know, and our team did it.
[02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:50.160]  And now we're going to do it for the Mac.
[02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:54.880]  And that means making it bigger, you know, not physically bigger, but just like metaphorically
[02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:55.280]  bigger.
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:03.120]  And the way that he posited it to me was telling us that in the way that they made their chips
[02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:08.720]  smaller and tinier to fit them on your wrist, they're going to make chips for the Mac that
[02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:16.640]  are so much faster and more powerful for the Mac that I'm expecting, like Led Zeppelin
[02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:20.480]  4, you know, like the album that is like, holy crap, I thought Led Zeppelin was playing
[02:16:20.480 --> 02:16:21.200]  heavy before.
[02:16:21.200 --> 02:16:22.320]  This is amazing.
[02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:26.080]  Like I'm expecting that's right.
[02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:26.560]  It does.
[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:27.120]  It did.
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:30.240]  I got the same impression the way that they talked about it.
[02:16:30.240 --> 02:16:38.480]  It's it was setting it up for a big reveal of sort of the you ain't seen nothing yet.
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:39.280]  You've seen a lot.
[02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:44.880]  You've seen what we can do, but this is within a certain thermal envelope that it's about
[02:16:44.880 --> 02:16:46.320]  to be unleashed, right?
[02:16:46.320 --> 02:16:52.320]  And so I, I really feel like it is easily an hour and I feel like a big part of it is
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:58.160]  sort of filling in like almost like what Srouji did at WWDC was a trailer.
[02:16:58.160 --> 02:17:00.960]  And now we get to see the movie where they're going to talk about their chips and they're
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:08.160]  going to talk about how they're pulling the pants off Intel and AMD in terms of what they're
[02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:09.280]  what they're capable of.
[02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:10.800]  That's interesting.
[02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:15.600]  Do you think that they would do more than one than Mac at the same time to show off?
[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:21.520]  Yeah, maybe because I kind of feel like the most unexpected thing would be again.
[02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:26.240]  I have no inside information about it, but what if they come out and say that, you know,
[02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:28.560]  it's the least expected Mac.
[02:17:28.560 --> 02:17:29.840]  It's the Mac Pro.
[02:17:29.840 --> 02:17:35.680]  It's the one that you can configure in a workstation up to $50,000 and we've got Apple Silicon
[02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:42.720]  running in it and, you know, if you just buy like the $6,000 model, look at the numbers
[02:17:42.720 --> 02:17:43.040]  it does.
[02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:45.280]  Look at what we can do with the $6,000 computer.
[02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:50.160]  And oh, by the way, if you, you know, for our $40,000, you know, it, it runs 10 circles
[02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:53.680]  around the equivalent Intel Xeon chips or something like that.
[02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:54.160]  I don't know.
[02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:57.280]  I just feel like that's what they were setting us up for.
[02:17:57.280 --> 02:18:02.160]  And the thing to remember is they even made a point of talking about how like, so the
[02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:05.920]  A series chips are the ones in the iPhones and iPads.
[02:18:06.480 --> 02:18:10.400]  And I think people are thinking like, oh, it would be like the A14M and that's the one
[02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:11.680]  they put in Macs.
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:15.760]  But there's no, it doesn't make any sense that there'd be one chip that would work in
[02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:23.520]  both a 12 inch, $1,200 MacBook and a $25,000 workstation.
[02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:30.720]  Uh, I, I re and I feel like he, Ruji almost spelled it out where they don't call it like
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:33.840]  the A8W for watch.
[02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:36.000]  It's not like they took the A8 and shrunk it down.
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:40.000]  They called it the S1 because it was an entirely different thing.
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:43.680]  I don't know what letter they're going to use because they've already used M for the,
[02:18:43.680 --> 02:18:47.920]  for the motion, but maybe X is my guess, like the Apple X1 chip.
[02:18:47.920 --> 02:18:51.840]  And that's the chip that's for, um, Macs.
[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:52.320]  I don't know.
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:56.640]  I don't know if one number would do, maybe it's an altogether new marketing scheme, but
[02:18:56.640 --> 02:19:04.800]  I'm expecting an announcement that's so big that it can't possibly coexist with the iPhone
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:12.160]  for, or 12 on stage in one event without sort of bifurcating people's attention from one
[02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:12.720]  or the other.
[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:15.600]  That's why I think it will be a different event.
[02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:21.200]  So you don't think there's any chance that it's the, you know, the famous call out to
[02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:25.120]  the one more thing, you know, and, and lift up a veil and show off, you know, the new
[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:26.720]  computer.
[02:19:26.720 --> 02:19:31.280]  It, it could be, you know, and maybe it's just the plainest thing possible where they
[02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:37.840]  do one more thing and they say, here is the, uh, the new Mac book and it has the A14 and
[02:19:37.840 --> 02:19:43.600]  it's exactly like, it's just the A14 and it's in a Mac book and it goes on sale December
[02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:44.560]  1st and that's it.
[02:19:44.560 --> 02:19:46.960]  And it's like, Oh, that wasn't that big a deal.
[02:19:46.960 --> 02:19:49.840]  And they don't talk about any other Mac hardware until next year.
[02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:52.480]  And next year is when we hear the bigger story.
[02:19:52.480 --> 02:19:56.080]  It could be, it could be like the most simple thing in five minutes does it and it just
[02:19:56.080 --> 02:19:59.360]  looks like a Mac book that we know and that's it.
[02:19:59.360 --> 02:20:01.920]  But I tend to, I would bet the other way.
[02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:08.240]  Um, and of course they already, they've been shipping the developer kits for all, but those
[02:20:08.240 --> 02:20:10.720]  are running on the actual iPad pro chips.
[02:20:10.720 --> 02:20:11.120]  Is that right?
[02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:16.640]  Yeah, it's exactly the A12Z from the current iPad pros.
[02:20:17.440 --> 02:20:17.680]  Right.
[02:20:17.680 --> 02:20:24.400]  So it's, it's presumably slower than the A14, right, that's in the new iPad Air, which is
[02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:25.520]  about to be in the new iPhone.
[02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:30.720]  It's slower in single processing and faster in multi-threaded processing and the graphics
[02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:32.800]  are probably still faster in the A12Z.
[02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:33.920]  Okay.
[02:20:34.720 --> 02:20:38.160]  Cause the other, the other interesting element is I think they stated on the record, right,
[02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:41.120]  that they're, they're launching the whole lineup by the end of next year.
[02:20:41.120 --> 02:20:41.840]  Is that right?
[02:20:41.840 --> 02:20:43.200]  I think that's what they said.
[02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:48.880]  And so, you know, 2021 should see a revamp of everything in Apple's Mac lineup.
[02:20:50.480 --> 02:20:50.800]  Right.
[02:20:50.800 --> 02:20:55.520]  And so that's the other thing where they could do just like a tease of the first product
[02:20:55.520 --> 02:21:00.160]  and then have some big event at the early part of next year for like everything that's
[02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:00.560]  coming.
[02:21:01.120 --> 02:21:03.680]  I'm just trying to think through if there's like some other way they could do it.
[02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:09.120]  But yeah, they don't, obviously they don't want to take away from the star of the show
[02:21:09.120 --> 02:21:13.360]  and we know that there's going to be, or we presume that there's going to be a few other things
[02:21:13.360 --> 02:21:17.040]  like we talked about, maybe AirTags and maybe the HomePod mini or whatever.
[02:21:17.600 --> 02:21:21.280]  Or Air, yeah, AirPods that go over your ears studio.
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:22.240]  Right, right, right.
[02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:23.440]  Those, right.
[02:21:23.440 --> 02:21:26.480]  But those things all act as peripherals to your iPhone, right?
[02:21:26.480 --> 02:21:27.520]  The iPhone, right.
[02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:32.080]  If you do AirTag, or if you do all of them, if they say, hey, we have AirTags and new
[02:21:32.080 --> 02:21:38.640]  AirPods that go over your ears with studio quality sound and a new HomePod, they all
[02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:44.000]  work as part of the, you know, the same story as new iPhones.
[02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.960]  Whereas the Mac is an entirely different story, right?
[02:21:46.960 --> 02:21:48.640]  And they could do it as one more thing.
[02:21:48.640 --> 02:21:52.240]  It could just be, oh, and by the way, we told you about the Macs and here's the thing.
[02:21:52.240 --> 02:21:56.800]  But if they do that, that just means that the first Macs to come out are performance
[02:21:56.800 --> 02:22:01.280]  wise, just in line with the iPads and iPhones that we know.
[02:22:01.280 --> 02:22:04.880]  Because the other thing, and again, not to read too much into the name, but if they're
[02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:09.040]  going to talk about speed, they can't come out and say, here's the new iPhones.
[02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:14.160]  They cost up to $1,000 and it's the A14 and here's how fast it is.
[02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:18.560]  And by the way, here's these Macs that are 10 times faster because they're Macs.
[02:22:18.560 --> 02:22:19.280]  Right, right.
[02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:23.520]  They, you know, it would have to be Macs that are, you know, like the same speed.
[02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:27.840]  Well, that's an interesting point because then what it's sort of, again, obviously,
[02:22:27.840 --> 02:22:31.280]  like this is just where my mind is trailing, but it's like, they could, you could see a
[02:22:31.280 --> 02:22:37.040]  world in which then they do the mythical 12 inch one, which is actually running a chip
[02:22:37.040 --> 02:22:42.240]  that is very similar to the iPad Pro chip because they want to keep the battery life
[02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:45.600]  and the svelteness of the device is the key factor.
[02:22:45.600 --> 02:22:49.920]  And then the super chips are coming next year, but we're going to have this first Mac which
[02:22:49.920 --> 02:22:54.720]  runs, yeah, it's like, it's faster than the most recent Intel ones, but it's, you know,
[02:22:54.720 --> 02:23:01.520]  it's basically running the same iPad system on a chip and we're going to have some other
[02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:02.640]  Macs to talk about next year.
[02:23:02.640 --> 02:23:03.600]  You could see a world in which they do.
[02:23:03.600 --> 02:23:04.800]  Yeah, I could definitely see that.
[02:23:04.800 --> 02:23:11.120]  It just depends on how impressive a family of chips they're ready to unveil this year.
[02:23:11.120 --> 02:23:15.280]  If it's an impressive family that's going to scale to things like desktops, like iMac
[02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:22.480]  Pros or just, just playing iMacs, then I think it gets its own event slash streaming, whatever
[02:23:22.480 --> 02:23:23.600]  you want to call it.
[02:23:23.600 --> 02:23:27.120]  I don't know, the air tags and stuff like that.
[02:23:27.120 --> 02:23:29.440]  I feel like those, you know, if they're ready, they're ready.
[02:23:29.440 --> 02:23:30.640]  And if they're not, they're not.
[02:23:30.640 --> 02:23:35.440]  But if they are, you know, of course they just slip right into the story with the iPhones
[02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:36.080]  on Tuesday.
[02:23:37.360 --> 02:23:37.600]  Right.
[02:23:37.600 --> 02:23:40.880]  And it seems like some of these things at least have been ready and just waiting for
[02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:41.520]  the right time.
[02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:43.680]  And you know, this would presumably be the right time.
[02:23:43.680 --> 02:23:46.000]  Yeah, yeah, that's what I think.
[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.240]  So anyway, it's no use speculating too much more.
[02:23:48.240 --> 02:23:49.840]  I mean, we'll find out soon enough.
[02:23:49.840 --> 02:23:53.840]  So unless you have anything else to add, we can wrap up, but it's always good to talk
[02:23:53.840 --> 02:23:54.080]  to you.
[02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:59.680]  Hopefully it won't be another 18 months and hopefully the world will be a much better
[02:23:59.680 --> 02:24:01.040]  place next time we talk.
[02:24:03.040 --> 02:24:04.080]  Yeah, I mean, I hope so.
[02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:10.080]  Hopefully Regeneron is out for everyone and we can, I've made this joke to John like multiple
[02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:12.080]  times, but I just find it so amusing.
[02:24:12.080 --> 02:24:15.760]  The name of a company is a super drug that we all need to take.
[02:24:15.760 --> 02:24:21.600]  But yeah, I hope the world is in a better place the next time we talk and I hope the
[02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:24.400]  next time we talk is only a few months from now and even the world is a better place.
[02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:27.920]  They should just pump it into the drinking water like fluoride, you know, like the fluoride
[02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:29.200]  was to the 1950s.
[02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:32.800]  Just put Regeneron into the tap water and then we can bathe in it.
[02:24:32.800 --> 02:24:34.000]  We can shower with it.
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:45.760]  It's, it'll be everywhere.
