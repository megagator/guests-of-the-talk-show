[00:00.000 --> 00:06.560]  So the one good thing about podcasting is that nobody it doesn't matter what jokes I crack. Nobody's gonna come up and give me a smack
[00:08.320 --> 00:10.320]  Oh my god
[00:11.200 --> 00:14.480]  So brutal is that bananas or what is isn't that crazy?
[00:15.520 --> 00:21.440]  Yeah, I mean in the end nobody should ever be assaulted, but it's just such a layered
[00:22.080 --> 00:23.600]  it you know
[00:23.600 --> 00:30.240]  complex situation that you get the I mean obviously so shocking right to see out there and then
[00:30.240 --> 00:35.280]  You sort of think all kinds of things immediately like what you know, did that really happen all that stuff and then?
[00:35.920 --> 00:41.220]  You get the immediate hot takes and the second day hot takes and the third day hot takes. It's just exhausting
[00:41.680 --> 00:47.600]  So we we we don't watch the oscars live and haven't for years. I I you know, it's just a little tedious
[00:47.600 --> 00:51.840]  I like movies but it's you know, I think for the reason a lot of people don't watch anymore
[00:51.840 --> 00:57.840]  But amy and I were going to bed on sunday night and amy went upstairs first and jonas said something
[00:58.080 --> 01:02.000]  About it and she was like what and I was like, oh I gotta find out what this is about
[01:02.560 --> 01:04.640]  and it was like because they they like
[01:05.200 --> 01:07.840]  Muted it on the live american broadcast, you know
[01:07.840 --> 01:14.800]  I guess because there's some kind of tape delay jonas had like a clip from the internet that was from like japanese tv. So it
[01:16.240 --> 01:18.560]  It was such a bananas way to watch it
[01:18.560 --> 01:23.200]  But it was clearly real, you know, and I do think I know everybody's talking about it
[01:23.200 --> 01:26.480]  But I think there's a reason everybody's talking about it is it's like the rare
[01:27.500 --> 01:28.800]  incident
[01:28.800 --> 01:30.720]  where it's
[01:30.720 --> 01:32.560]  it's it's like
[01:32.560 --> 01:38.240]  the perfect storm and I I said this to amy and she thought I was nuts, but I said it was sort of like
[01:39.120 --> 01:44.240]  Remember that that meme that you have to remember this the meme that went around like five six seven years ago about that
[01:44.240 --> 01:50.560]  What color is this dress? Is it blue or is it right gold or I forget what the two colors were?
[01:50.960 --> 01:54.560]  But yeah, yeah blue and gold. Yeah. Yeah, and it's like, you know, it's somebody, you know
[01:54.560 --> 02:00.800]  It was just like a weird trick of the lighting and and a weird trick of the way digital cameras work
[02:01.040 --> 02:07.200]  Where it's like some people perceived it as blue and some perceived it as gold and it was pretty close to 50 50
[02:07.200 --> 02:14.400]  50 and I did I saw polling on this chris rock will smith thing and it is so close to 50 50
[02:14.480 --> 02:19.040]  It is a stop. You can't find anything like this. That's 50 50 and and the poll I saw
[02:19.600 --> 02:22.720]  Asked the respondents it was like a poll of 2 000 people
[02:23.360 --> 02:26.160]  And they asked them who they voted for in a presidential election
[02:26.880 --> 02:33.920]  And it was the exact it was to the tenth of a percentage point like trump voters and biden voters
[02:34.320 --> 02:36.320]  Were both split 50 50
[02:36.320 --> 02:41.840]  Between will you know who was more wrong will smith or chris rock and it's like wait. Do you remember who was who?
[02:42.960 --> 02:45.680]  What was what was what was the who who thought will was wrong?
[02:46.240 --> 02:49.760]  It no no i'm saying that there was no difference between trump and biden voters
[02:49.760 --> 02:55.600]  I see what you're saying like the the the trump voters were 50 50 split. Yeah, as well as the bite as well
[02:56.400 --> 03:01.200]  Yeah, and and so you thought you said there was a partisan divide. I was very curious to hear what that was
[03:01.440 --> 03:02.320]  No
[03:02.320 --> 03:09.760]  There there was like a mild socio-economic divide where it's like the the wealthier people reported
[03:10.160 --> 03:15.760]  Being the more likely they were to say chris rock was wronged, you know
[03:15.840 --> 03:23.040]  Like and then people with lower income were more likely to say will smith but even there it it wasn't
[03:23.680 --> 03:29.280]  Nothing got out of the 50s, you know, it wasn't like a huge split right right and man. It's just like
[03:29.280 --> 03:33.760]  Sorry, go ahead. Well men and women were very both very close to 50 50. Although women
[03:34.400 --> 03:37.280]  Women were a little bit more on will smith's side, you know
[03:37.280 --> 03:42.160]  Like hey, he was defending his wife and men were a little bit more on chris rock's side
[03:42.320 --> 03:47.920]  But again, very close to 50 50 just that and I think that's why you know, the whole world can't stop talking about it
[03:48.720 --> 03:55.360]  Yeah, it's a pure definition like literal definition of a polarizing topic right when you have that kind of split and it's just
[03:55.360 --> 04:02.880]  It's so layered. It does not lend itself whatsoever to pithy takes right and that's the thing
[04:02.880 --> 04:07.680]  I think that our reaction especially driven by social media and the general polarization of
[04:08.320 --> 04:13.760]  of sentiment right and the value of shock and awe and this kind of
[04:14.480 --> 04:16.480]  lean towards
[04:16.800 --> 04:23.280]  Extremes in our media consumption and entertainment and frankly in human interaction
[04:23.280 --> 04:30.260]  In human interaction, right? Like then if you want to put it under a big umbrella, it's the polarization of civilization
[04:30.880 --> 04:38.180]  Right, like that's that's really what it is and in all of these tools technological and and sociological
[04:39.280 --> 04:43.600]  trends have sort of pushed people towards this polarization thing and
[04:44.160 --> 04:47.280]  You know the both of them were wrong to some degree
[04:48.140 --> 04:50.140]  argument is very hard to
[04:50.140 --> 04:56.700]  Make publicly without the polarization without the polarized crowd, right, you know coming in and going how dare you?
[04:57.020 --> 05:03.580]  Right, because it's very easy to say how dare you suggest that anybody should ever be assaulted physically, which is true
[05:03.900 --> 05:04.380]  It's hard
[05:04.380 --> 05:09.580]  You can't it's very difficult to argue that in situations other than self-defense or defensive
[05:09.980 --> 05:16.540]  Another physically, you know physical defense that it it's defensible right to physically assault somebody else. But
[05:16.540 --> 05:21.180]  There's also the argument on the other side. It's like well should you know, everybody have the right to
[05:21.980 --> 05:23.820]  You know verbally
[05:23.820 --> 05:29.580]  insult and verbally assault anybody else with no repercussions or no checks and balances
[05:29.980 --> 05:34.220]  And then you come right back with the argument. Yes, but should those checks and balances come in the form of physical assault?
[05:34.220 --> 05:39.820]  It's really hard to argue that they should right and so like you get this back and forth and then you add into that
[05:39.820 --> 05:43.180]  on top of this this whole sociological layer about
[05:43.180 --> 05:50.700]  The way that black women are treated and then then their general respect that has afforded them the general idea of their
[05:51.420 --> 05:52.460]  sort of
[05:52.460 --> 05:57.420]  just the the society tends to treat them as less valuable, you know, and
[05:58.380 --> 06:04.060]  And not view their safety and security and respect as a as a matter of tantamount
[06:04.700 --> 06:09.820]  You know importance and you add in that layer and then you add in the layer of you know
[06:09.820 --> 06:12.940]  That will smith is a black man. And so you've got racial
[06:13.980 --> 06:22.140]  Situations or scenarios that are that are playing out you have stereotypes that play out you have all of the people that want to read
[06:22.700 --> 06:24.620]  the situation a certain way
[06:24.620 --> 06:27.820]  Seeing validation in their own polarization, right?
[06:27.820 --> 06:33.180]  And i'm not passing any judgment either way because I don't I feel i'm probably one of the least qualified people on the planet
[06:33.180 --> 06:38.300]  Right, there's plenty of people that are much smarter than I am, but I think it's absolutely clear that it's not that it's not that
[06:38.300 --> 06:41.180]  I think it's absolutely clear that everybody has an opinion
[06:41.740 --> 06:46.700]  And it's very interesting just to see all of the layering of these different, you know
[06:46.780 --> 06:50.140]  different factors at play and it's a perfect storm because obviously
[06:50.780 --> 06:56.460]  Highly televised highly publicized event and it's a weird scenario where the base
[06:57.900 --> 07:01.740]  Like obviously jada is being sidelined by a lot of the discussion here, you know
[07:01.740 --> 07:07.420]  And she's not really like her pov and her her sort of part in this is all getting sidelined because these two
[07:07.420 --> 07:13.260]  You know guys had this altercation and two men in in her life or one man in her life and one not had this altercation
[07:13.340 --> 07:14.700]  but
[07:14.700 --> 07:21.420]  I really do feel it like the idea that they're both very wealthy both very well known both famous
[07:21.980 --> 07:26.220]  It lends itself to like a sort of now not for better for worse, right?
[07:26.220 --> 07:30.380]  I'm not passing judgment on whether it should or not, but it actually makes it easier for people to talk about it
[07:30.940 --> 07:35.820]  Like it's not somebody who's obviously in a position of much more power assaulting somebody
[07:35.820 --> 07:40.700]  In a much lower position like what if will smith hit a waiter right and like that it would be I think
[07:41.340 --> 07:45.820]  The your percentages would be different right now. I'm not saying it's valid or not
[07:46.060 --> 07:51.580]  I'm, just saying that I think that that idea of them both being very famous well-known and powerful people
[07:51.980 --> 07:55.260]  Also lends itself to the polarization because it's like hey
[07:56.140 --> 07:58.220]  You know, they both had a choice to make here
[07:58.860 --> 08:03.900]  You know chris rock could not have insulted her and will smith could not have assaulted chris, but I think that it's
[08:03.900 --> 08:05.660]  but I think that it's
[08:05.660 --> 08:11.180]  Easier to have that discussion when it's two very very famous very popular people, you know
[08:11.420 --> 08:13.260]  So I think it's like a perfect storm as you said
[08:13.260 --> 08:17.020]  They're as close to peers as you could get I mean, I guess you know
[08:17.100 --> 08:21.100]  I I guess I would say will smith is a bigger star. I mean, he's a movie star
[08:21.180 --> 08:28.300]  He's literally was one of the bizarre things is it wasn't just will smith like last year coming up on stage and slapping
[08:28.300 --> 08:34.540]  Chris rock or next year. It was this year the year that he was nominated and was like
[08:35.020 --> 08:37.420]  Half an hour away from winning best actor
[08:38.380 --> 08:41.340]  Which I don't think is actually totally coincidental. I
[08:42.300 --> 08:47.820]  Can't help but think that he was his emotions were on edge because that was still forthcoming
[08:48.060 --> 08:53.500]  Right, like and and I know that the best actor and actress awards come at the very end
[08:53.820 --> 08:57.100]  Right before best picture because they're like the biggest award so you save them
[08:57.100 --> 09:00.940]  So there's not much room afterwards, but I feel like if he had already won
[09:01.580 --> 09:05.980]  Maybe it wouldn't have happened, you know, but he was on edge. Who knows what was going through his head
[09:06.300 --> 09:08.140]  But you know, I don't want to belabor this
[09:08.140 --> 09:12.700]  I know everybody's listened to it to death, but I can't I couldn't let the show go and I knew you'd have a good take
[09:12.700 --> 09:16.700]  Which you did but I do think the one thing you mentioned that totally resonates for me
[09:17.420 --> 09:22.460]  Is tremendous sympathy for jada pinkett smith because she had nothing to do with this
[09:22.460 --> 09:26.220]  She didn't crack a joke that you know, you could say hey, you shouldn't be joking about that
[09:26.220 --> 09:29.020]  It's a medical condition or he should know better, you know
[09:29.020 --> 09:32.780]  And that she'd be sensitive about it and she didn't go up and slap anybody, you know
[09:32.780 --> 09:36.300]  But yet she's literally in the middle of the whole thing and didn't ask for it
[09:37.340 --> 09:39.340]  Right, right. Yeah
[09:39.340 --> 09:42.140]  Yeah, it's hard. I mean, I think that's kind of one clear thing that
[09:43.020 --> 09:47.740]  You know comes out of it is that you feel bad, you know for her position in the whole thing coming and going
[09:47.740 --> 09:53.100]  You know and it is it is a sad situation for all involved. I I don't I don't think that anybody
[09:53.100 --> 09:55.980]  You know benefits from this scenario in any clear way
[09:56.540 --> 10:02.540]  At all and you know, there's no winner here and it's impossible to ever declare one. I feel like what what?
[10:03.180 --> 10:07.340]  I don't know. I can't speak to you know, I know will smith apologized to chris rock
[10:07.980 --> 10:13.980]  On instagram then and I think chris rock has been silent on the matter at least this is up till last night
[10:13.980 --> 10:19.180]  And I think he's doing a show in boston tonight and maybe is sort of saving his public remarks
[10:19.180 --> 10:24.780]  For his comedy show tonight, but I do feel I feel like they'll they'll patch this up and like somebody
[10:24.780 --> 10:31.180]  I forget who it was on twitter. It was like 10 bucks says next year's oscars will smith and chris rock come out together to give an award
[10:31.180 --> 10:36.700]  You know like because they can make this go away right like they you know now i'm not even saying they should you know
[10:36.700 --> 10:38.300]  That's what's so you know
[10:38.300 --> 10:43.580]  You know, I know there's literally turn the other cheek. I mean i'm not even saying that chris rock should forgive him
[10:43.580 --> 10:46.300]  I'm, not saying will smith. It's just so bizarrely
[10:46.300 --> 10:53.020]  You could not write a better scenario. And and the other thing that I thought was so interesting was reading the after the fact
[10:54.380 --> 10:58.460]  Backstage drama where the people who run the show are like what do we do?
[10:58.620 --> 11:06.300]  Should we have him escorted out like this was you know, I mean, you know, he he he literally assaulted somebody on right on camera
[11:06.300 --> 11:08.300]  Should you know but he was also?
[11:08.940 --> 11:13.740]  Waiting, you know and they don't know that he won. I mean it is true like my son
[11:13.740 --> 11:20.380]  Doesn't believe me, but I really do believe that that the academy awards take the secrecy of the
[11:21.020 --> 11:26.060]  Ballots and the the I think it's still price waterhouse coopers or somebody is the only people, you know
[11:26.060 --> 11:30.720]  There's a very limited number of people who know the actual winners, but they knew he was nominated
[11:31.020 --> 11:35.900]  They know that he was actually the odds-on favorite this year. What do you do and does that alter your opinion?
[11:35.900 --> 11:39.980]  You know, how do you do this? And it's like what they have 10 minutes to make a decision, you know
[11:39.980 --> 11:44.540]  What's the right thing to do? Do you do you escort him out because he did this. Do you leave him in?
[11:44.540 --> 11:48.380]  Does it make a difference that he still has an award coming? It's all so complicated
[11:49.420 --> 11:51.980]  Yeah, I know. I mean I you know, it's
[11:53.580 --> 11:59.500]  If it was me it would be hard like I I don't think that I can put myself in the academy scenario there
[11:59.500 --> 12:04.540]  This is a very complex situation very fast developing. You're like what the heck just happened, you know in a lot of cases
[12:04.540 --> 12:06.540]  I think I think though to like
[12:06.540 --> 12:10.460]  One of our events, you know one of our shows something like hey, what are what would I do?
[12:10.460 --> 12:15.740]  All right. All right. What would I do if somebody assaulted a guest or something on stage and like it's very clear to me
[12:15.740 --> 12:22.140]  I really didn't matter who they were and I would ask them to leave but I also never you know, obviously put on an oscars
[12:22.140 --> 12:28.460]  So yeah, I know but you know like it right like in our case like if it was a tech crunch event or something like that
[12:28.460 --> 12:30.460]  I mean, you know there I I
[12:31.500 --> 12:33.500]  I guess it's well, I I I I
[12:33.500 --> 12:40.060]  I guess it's well, I I met Derek Jeter as you recall at a tech crunch event in New York with my son
[12:40.060 --> 12:41.100]  Which was pretty, you know
[12:41.100 --> 12:47.420]  It's pretty big stars come to the tech crunch event and and Jeter was on stage to talk about the the launch of what's called
[12:47.420 --> 12:53.100]  The players Tribune. So I mean, you know, there's real stars who come to these events. I mean what happened?
[12:53.100 --> 12:56.700]  I mean Derek Jeter seems unlikely to slap somebody but you know
[12:57.420 --> 13:02.140]  Yeah, I don't know. It's just bananas. Anyway, I'll take a break here and then we'll get on with the real show
[13:02.140 --> 13:07.340]  And then we'll get on with the real show, but I want to thank our first sponsor to our good friends at Squarespace

[14:42.700 --> 14:47.820]  Matthew where certain things five years ago. Was it four years ago? Was it three years ago?
[14:48.380 --> 14:53.260]  Start to blur together. I think because of the I I think because of this gap, you know
[14:53.260 --> 14:56.540]  It's almost like a science fiction gap of covid, right?
[14:57.980 --> 15:04.220]  Where like you like you've been time space traveling and your relativity has has screwed with your perception of time
[15:04.540 --> 15:06.140]  Yeah, and it's like all of a sudden yeah
[15:06.140 --> 15:11.340]  You you know you volunteer to go on a mission and you go out in a spaceship and you you know break a record for
[15:11.340 --> 15:16.940]  You know break a record for something and you come back and now your your kids are your age and it's like what how'd that happen?
[15:17.100 --> 15:18.380]  There's like a gap
[15:18.380 --> 15:25.260]  But to research this to have you on the show to talk about apple's studio products the studio display and the mac studio
[15:25.340 --> 15:28.940]  You know, I went back and I looked and and you even opened your your interview
[15:29.100 --> 15:35.660]  You had you scored a great interview with tom boeger from mac product marketing zander. What's zander's last name?
[15:35.740 --> 15:37.420]  I have it right here in front of sword
[15:37.420 --> 15:43.180]  Yeah, zander sauren who I remember the first time I remember him was demoing I forget if it was the first garage band
[15:43.340 --> 15:46.220]  Or if it was like a major version of garage band
[15:46.780 --> 15:48.620]  But at town hall and yeah
[15:48.620 --> 15:55.020]  He's been with those teams for a very long time and shelly goldberg who is senior director of the mac and ipad product design
[15:55.580 --> 16:00.380]  And you got to talk about both products, but you even open put it in your lead for this
[16:00.780 --> 16:05.500]  Terrific feature interview with the three of them that the mac studio and the studio display
[16:05.500 --> 16:11.660]  Are still coming from that remarkable roundtable discussion that you and I were present for
[16:12.060 --> 16:16.700]  And as soon as I read that i'm like, oh man, what a great way to tie this together because this is so true
[16:17.020 --> 16:19.580]  This is what I want to talk to matthew about and i'm like wait
[16:19.580 --> 16:22.620]  when was that was that like three years ago four years ago and then
[16:23.260 --> 16:29.820]  2017 april of 2017 five years ago. I can't believe that was five years ago. I know
[16:29.820 --> 16:37.100]  I know. Yes, the time compression is in full effect. I I was shocked too when I looked up my articles like wait
[16:37.980 --> 16:41.360]  Wait, really? I still remember afterwards
[16:42.140 --> 16:43.500]  You and me
[16:43.500 --> 16:47.580]  Like trying to bang out some takes and get get something done
[16:48.460 --> 16:49.500]  and
[16:49.500 --> 16:53.900]  You sent the recording like we we didn't have like we weren't you know
[16:53.900 --> 16:58.220]  It was like it wasn't off the record famously because they wanted us to write about it
[16:58.220 --> 17:01.660]  But we weren't supposed to publish, you know, like a recording of it
[17:02.060 --> 17:06.300]  But we were allowed to record it for our own notes and you got you know
[17:06.300 --> 17:10.060]  like a colleague at tech crunch to do a transcript and I just
[17:10.460 --> 17:14.220]  I just remember and I was like, oh that would be so helpful if you could share that with me because I was like
[17:14.220 --> 17:20.060]  Trying to take notes by hand and it's like I I just remember it like it was yesterday and yet it was five years ago
[17:22.220 --> 17:26.860]  Yeah, it does it does play with the uh perception of time this whole covid thing
[17:26.860 --> 17:30.940]  It's a it's a crazy one and like that honestly, it feels like another world, too
[17:31.660 --> 17:35.740]  Because that was you know, uh, and not at on infinite loop
[17:35.740 --> 17:40.780]  But at an extension of infinite loops campus in an outbuilding where they had at the time
[17:40.940 --> 17:46.780]  Obviously that's all been moved over to the new headquarters. But at the time they had their mac development components
[17:46.860 --> 17:53.260]  They had their their their laboratory machine shop, you know with literal the machines they use to
[17:53.260 --> 17:59.820]  to lay the prototype and chip away and and manufacture casings and hinges and
[18:00.140 --> 18:05.740]  In you know macbook parts and mac pro designs and specifications all of that stuff
[18:05.740 --> 18:10.940]  This was their actual machine shop set up like a real machine shop smelled like one felt like one, you know
[18:11.100 --> 18:15.980]  And that's where they hosted us. But now of course, they have this pristine new ufo thing
[18:15.980 --> 18:20.860]  And so like it also feels like wow, wow where that feels like an ancient piece of history
[18:20.860 --> 18:23.740]  You know when they're when they were doing it from that location, too
[18:24.780 --> 18:26.780]  so one of the weird things and I I
[18:26.940 --> 18:31.100]  I obsess over these things that you know today is further from blank
[18:31.420 --> 18:36.540]  than blank was from this thing that doesn't seem like it was that much further behind it and
[18:37.420 --> 18:43.900]  That the trash can for lack of I know people at apple hate hearing it called that the trash can mac pro the
[18:44.540 --> 18:46.540]  Small cylinder the cylindrical
[18:46.540 --> 18:53.500]  Cylindrical mac pro came out in 2013. And so the mac pro round table, which was largely
[18:54.360 --> 18:57.760]  Explicitly not implicitly but explicitly about acknowledging
[18:58.380 --> 18:59.980]  that it was
[18:59.980 --> 19:07.520]  a mistake, you know as famously as federighi told us that they had painted themselves into a thermal corner and hadn't foreseen
[19:08.540 --> 19:13.180]  the rise a decade ago of GPUs as
[19:13.180 --> 19:15.840]  as integral to the pro
[19:16.760 --> 19:20.640]  Experience. Well, that's four years, right? It felt like, you know, it's 2013
[19:21.440 --> 19:27.520]  Then it's like the mac stagnates four years later. They called a bunch of us up had us come in for this truly
[19:27.680 --> 19:33.520]  you know open discussion about this and it but it felt like it when we did that that that
[19:33.520 --> 19:42.160]  That cylindrical mac pro was old and stagnant, but that was only four years prior now here. We are five years later and
[19:43.280 --> 19:51.120]  We've got the studio Mac studio and the studio display and this series of ever more impressive and different
[19:51.640 --> 19:54.620]  expansion of Apple silicon throughout the Mac Mac line
[19:55.520 --> 19:59.920]  It's yeah, it's like that 70 show moment where like that 70 show today would be about like
[19:59.920 --> 20:02.680]  2000 2007 or something
[20:04.320 --> 20:11.760]  Yeah, exactly exactly or like when I was a kid happy days was about these kid teenagers in Milwaukee in the 50s and it
[20:11.760 --> 20:18.740]  Might for me in the 70s. It might as well have been about like Abe Lincoln's time in the 1860s. I was like
[20:19.320 --> 20:24.980]  Right. I don't know what's going on with this crazy music and they've got jukeboxes and these crazy cars
[20:24.980 --> 20:30.500]  That was forever ago. Whereas it was really a 16 17 years or something like that. Yeah, exactly
[20:30.900 --> 20:33.820]  Yeah, but the trashcan disc does feel like
[20:34.620 --> 20:38.420]  Ancient history and the fact is is that that that amount of time?
[20:39.700 --> 20:45.940]  You know, obviously it wasn't when we when they we had that meeting and they were talking to us about it
[20:46.300 --> 20:49.700]  The important context to to remember if people weren't like, you know
[20:49.700 --> 20:57.180]  reading those articles and remembering that is that they were just telling us that they had done something wrong and they were not yet ready to
[20:57.180 --> 21:04.140]  Say anything about what they were doing to fix it, right? Right. They were just saying hey, this is the wrong way to go and
[21:06.060 --> 21:08.060]  Okay, bye
[21:09.820 --> 21:17.700]  That was wrong that was bad and and and to emphasize that we we get that that what we have today with our Mac Pro
[21:17.700 --> 21:22.740]  Is not suiting the needs of our pro customers on the Mac and we are still committed to the Mac
[21:22.860 --> 21:27.220]  Yeah, it I I feel like that something about it. We're just not sure what yet
[21:27.220 --> 21:32.380]  Oh, we're not ready to talk about what yet, right? I guess the one thing they they dropped a hint back then
[21:33.340 --> 21:36.760]  Fairly strong hint was what would become the iMac Pro
[21:37.220 --> 21:39.900]  You know that that they said something to the you know
[21:39.900 --> 21:42.020]  They're like we really can't tell you what we have in mind
[21:42.020 --> 21:48.220]  But we will tell you that one of the things we've been thinking was that we could do an iMac
[21:48.220 --> 21:55.240]  That is more suited for our pro customers something like that. They didn't give us the name iMac Pro, but it was
[21:55.780 --> 21:59.620]  About as close as ever on or off the record
[22:00.020 --> 22:05.740]  Anybody in Apple product marketing has ever come to spilling the name of an upcoming device
[22:05.740 --> 22:09.300]  It was sort of like it would be an iMac and it would be Pro
[22:09.300 --> 22:13.340]  You know, we can't tell you what it's called intent
[22:14.260 --> 22:20.880]  But we really do think that an iMac that is intended for our pro customers could be a really
[22:21.540 --> 22:26.100]  Important product and we've been working on something like that that we you know, we'll have to show you
[22:26.180 --> 22:34.020]  You know sooner rather than later, but I do think I'll start there like in in hindsight. It's like any kind of good
[22:34.860 --> 22:36.100]  mystery
[22:36.100 --> 22:37.260]  movie
[22:37.260 --> 22:41.780]  it you get these clues and then when you get to the
[22:42.500 --> 22:44.500]  The denouement, how do you pronounce it?
[22:45.180 --> 22:46.420]  Denouement denouement
[22:46.420 --> 22:50.700]  and then all of a sudden you can look back and fill in some blanks and
[22:50.820 --> 22:55.420]  the biggest blank that we've been able to fill in is the Apple silicon strategy and
[22:55.700 --> 23:03.300]  right and I really do think that there was that part of the the whole Mac lineup seems stretched thin and
[23:03.580 --> 23:05.260]  stagnant and
[23:05.260 --> 23:12.320]  Really concerning that maybe the company is only concerned about as you described it in your article the volcanic
[23:12.580 --> 23:18.900]  Popularity of iOS devices and they just can't they just don't have the attention to worry about Mac hardware
[23:18.980 --> 23:24.420]  But part of it too in hindsight has to be that they were they were like at that point
[23:24.420 --> 23:30.760]  They could see where the Apple silicon strategy was going to go and they could imagine the sort of performance
[23:30.760 --> 23:34.620]  They were going to get maybe not exact numbers, but you know at least ballpark
[23:34.620 --> 23:38.300]  You know, this is what we're going to be able to build in just a couple of years
[23:39.140 --> 23:40.340]  mm-hmm
[23:40.340 --> 23:45.340]  what do we do in the meet in the interim and you can see that they I think that there was sort of a
[23:46.580 --> 23:51.200]  Running out the clock on Intel like well we can just you know
[23:51.200 --> 23:56.460]  Let's save our most impressive designs for the Apple silicon because we can go thinner, you know
[23:56.460 --> 23:59.900]  It's not just like let's save the good designs for our own silicon
[23:59.900 --> 24:07.000]  It's our own silicon will enable us to make these fantastic designs that we can't make now with Intel. So why even try with Intel?
[24:07.000 --> 24:10.840]  Yes. Yes. There was a lot of models in there and I think like that
[24:11.260 --> 24:15.460]  It's like a 15 inch Pro in there somewhere that I don't know
[24:15.460 --> 24:20.180]  There was some questionable choices made in terms of processor generation, right?
[24:20.180 --> 24:25.980]  Right, like the Intel they chose an Intel part. That was you know, they're like, oh, why would you go with this Intel part?
[24:25.980 --> 24:32.180]  Like why not wait until X right or why not push it until Y right and I don't like I'm not I'm sorry
[24:32.180 --> 24:37.220]  I'm just not the the guy to remember all of the different architectures Kaby Lake and you know
[24:37.860 --> 24:42.700]  Sunspire and dogs, but or whatever like but that you know, there was basically a a
[24:43.220 --> 24:47.140]  Certain period in there where it did feel awkward. It felt like wow
[24:47.140 --> 24:50.820]  Why didn't they wait until Intel could do X Y or Z more for them?
[24:50.820 --> 24:57.740]  And the answer I think on Apple's side internally was hey, we don't really think we're ever gonna get what we really want from them
[24:57.740 --> 25:03.180]  And we're working to build something that we think will in terms of power in terms of power per watt for sure
[25:03.220 --> 25:07.940]  So we're just going to put in you know, an upgraded part very straightforward
[25:07.940 --> 25:14.380]  This is not really a new or big jump forward, but it does serve customers
[25:14.380 --> 25:19.660]  We just need a new laptop right or need a new me new hardware now and then we'll keep working on this other thing
[25:19.660 --> 25:24.220]  You know, and I think that answers a lot of the questions people had in the public about it about like hey
[25:24.220 --> 25:29.660]  Why would you go with this part or why not push Intel to do XY or why not wait until this part?
[25:30.140 --> 25:33.220]  Arrives to solve all your problems and apples like saying hey
[25:33.220 --> 25:35.340]  We got problems that we don't think Intel's ever gonna solve
[25:35.340 --> 25:41.780]  I do think that one of the things that I see differently in hindsight is the iMac Pro and
[25:43.180 --> 25:48.380]  It's it it it always seemed a little bit curious, you know that that you would
[25:48.380 --> 25:54.780]  go pro with an all-in-one design because and I know that the Apple has certainly starting from
[25:55.820 --> 25:58.980]  That that roundtable discussion five years ago unbelievably
[25:59.500 --> 26:05.660]  But they've started using the word modular a lot more with the Mac as it comes to their pro users
[26:05.660 --> 26:11.380]  You know and I think for all the obvious reasons, but an all-in-one iMac Pro is anti modular, right?
[26:11.380 --> 26:14.820]  Did you've got this these Xeon chips and?
[26:14.820 --> 26:21.980]  Xeon chips and truly pro performance where okay because they're Xeon chips single-core
[26:21.980 --> 26:25.540]  They're actually slower than lots of much less expensive
[26:26.540 --> 26:28.380]  consumer-oriented max that are on
[26:28.380 --> 26:35.420]  Newer Intel chips, but especially for people that whose main use case is not multi-threaded, right? Exactly, right
[26:35.420 --> 26:37.420]  But it's it just seemed a little curious that
[26:37.700 --> 26:44.220]  Single threaded was so much slower because these are Xeon chips and they take longer to come out on the same generation
[26:44.220 --> 26:46.220]  but for the pro users who are
[26:46.940 --> 26:53.700]  compiling lots of code and all sorts of you know files in a big Xcode project can be thrown out to a
[26:54.100 --> 27:00.060]  Dozen different CPUs and distribute this or are all the video and audio type things
[27:00.940 --> 27:03.980]  You know that they love to demo that that can be multi-threaded
[27:04.260 --> 27:12.240]  The performance was excellent and the thermals were amazing and the first real hint as to Apple's totally to me
[27:12.240 --> 27:14.240]  rejuvenated interest in
[27:14.720 --> 27:16.600]  advancing the state of
[27:16.600 --> 27:23.880]  Computer thermal system design, you know because one thing nobody ever really talked about with at least I'm not familiar with
[27:24.800 --> 27:31.400]  Before the Apple's iMac Pro was nobody ever talked, you know, these Intel Xeon chips boy
[27:31.400 --> 27:33.400]  You can make them run whisper quiet
[27:33.400 --> 27:41.600]  Right, right you can really really push push this multi-core design and
[27:42.720 --> 27:48.160]  Boy at a run quiet and cool, you know, nobody put it as close to your face as possible
[27:48.160 --> 27:53.100]  Like that's where you want to sit right behind your display. Nobody ever talked about that
[27:53.100 --> 27:57.720]  It was truly an astonishing design and in their hands-on area when it first came out
[27:57.720 --> 28:02.500]  They encouraged those of us who were there, you know, here's this demo machine
[28:02.500 --> 28:05.520]  I think the one that that I remember getting behind and you know
[28:05.520 --> 28:08.760]  There was plenty of room behind the desk or table counter
[28:08.760 --> 28:11.160]  whatever you want to call it where they had the demo station set up and they were
[28:11.880 --> 28:19.020]  Compiling lots and lots of code across multiple cores and here get down there put your ear right next to the vents
[28:19.020 --> 28:25.640]  See what you can hear and it's like yeah, I think I hear something but you know, it was clearly like within the placebo
[28:25.640 --> 28:32.320]  Range of I guess I hear something but it's you know, this is a maxed out Xeon that's that's been pressed for minutes doing
[28:32.720 --> 28:38.360]  One demo after another as the groups went around the room. Yeah, this is quiet and cool and it's it doesn't feel like
[28:38.360 --> 28:41.360]  I could cook an egg on it or anything like that. This is pretty amazing
[28:41.360 --> 28:47.640]  But in hindsight, it really was truly a stopgap design, right? And I think that it it that the
[28:48.520 --> 28:50.520]  last, you know this month's
[28:50.520 --> 28:58.280]  announcement and and product release of the max studio and and the combination this both products this max studio and the studio display
[28:59.000 --> 29:00.840]  sort of show
[29:00.840 --> 29:08.280]  The actual way forward for that market because that to me that that's the what the iMac Pro was meant for
[29:08.280 --> 29:13.960]  That audience is exactly the audience that is meant for the max studio with a studio display
[29:14.680 --> 29:19.560]  yeah, and I think that that audience was sort of willing to accept the iMac Pro because they got
[29:19.560 --> 29:25.400]  Pretty much the world's best display in a desktop, you know at that point and it's hard to argue against that right?
[29:25.400 --> 29:28.840]  It's hard to argue. Oh, wait, what if I want a different kind of monitor?
[29:28.840 --> 29:32.600]  What if I want a different setup because you go? Oh, well, you know, I can extend the monitor
[29:32.600 --> 29:37.320]  I obviously you can't use it as a target display, which still remains a pain point, but you could
[29:37.880 --> 29:42.200]  Ostensibly attach another monitor to it and you knew your main monitor was pretty damn good
[29:42.200 --> 29:47.880]  This wasn't some sort of all-in-one where you're getting some subpar display and then you feel itchy about it, right?
[29:47.880 --> 29:52.840]  It was the best monitor you could buy and so they felt as long as the performance was good. That's great
[29:52.840 --> 29:58.040]  So as you said the modularity aspect of it though was nowhere to be found
[29:58.040 --> 30:05.000]  You couldn't argue in any way shape or form that that was a modular design right it, you know, and I really feel like it was
[30:06.200 --> 30:09.880]  You know and they did come out, you know, like I guess the last
[30:10.520 --> 30:16.760]  Obviously the last hurrah of the whole Mac stint on Intel was the Mac Pro
[30:16.760 --> 30:20.680]  from 2019 and I know they had some
[30:21.320 --> 30:27.800]  Intel models that came out until the end of 2020, but none of them were all new designs, right?
[30:27.880 --> 30:34.200]  They were all you know, looks exactly like the previous generation, but we've upgraded to whatever core
[30:35.060 --> 30:42.520]  I7 and I9 whatever Intel's upgraded to like you said Skylake, Doggy Lake, Doggy Paddle, whatever
[30:43.000 --> 30:44.840]  right
[30:44.840 --> 30:46.840]  The Mac Pro is the last
[30:47.000 --> 30:51.480]  Truly new Intel based product and it shows, you know, it's the fact and again though
[30:51.480 --> 30:54.040]  It was sort of a stop gap right that they came out with it
[30:55.720 --> 30:57.000]  Did
[30:57.000 --> 30:58.280]  truly
[30:58.280 --> 31:03.320]  What would you call it exuberant exorbitant industrial design on on the?
[31:04.600 --> 31:12.760]  Yes. Yeah, the air channeling and the cheese grater and the the a very aggressive stand for the monitor
[31:12.760 --> 31:16.840]  And everything else thousand dollar thousand dollar thousand dollar wheels
[31:17.880 --> 31:19.880]  Yes, thousand dollar wheels, right?
[31:19.960 --> 31:25.720]  They they you know spared no effort and made something that wasn't just like oh, well, you know
[31:26.520 --> 31:29.000]  It and in some ways was sort of the anti
[31:29.800 --> 31:34.600]  iMac Pro where the iMac Pro it's like, okay, we'll change the color of the aluminum to
[31:35.720 --> 31:37.720]  Space gray to show that it's pro
[31:37.720 --> 31:43.960]  Pro right and otherwise it looks exactly like the 27 inch 5k
[31:44.040 --> 31:48.360]  iMac that had been out since 2014 or so or 2013 whenever it was
[31:48.920 --> 31:53.640]  Even though inside where you never ever get to look it's this whole new
[31:54.420 --> 31:56.840]  incredible thermal system to get these
[31:57.640 --> 32:04.600]  Crazy much more powerful and hotter Xeon chips to run within the same form factor as the regular consumer 5k
[32:04.600 --> 32:09.560]  But you don't see it, right? And so the opposite of that would be the Mac Pro where it's like, okay
[32:09.640 --> 32:15.960]  You want a a big desktop rig? Here you go. You could you know, you could fit like a small dog in here
[32:16.040 --> 32:18.840]  You know, no problem, right? You know, this is pretty big box
[32:19.560 --> 32:20.760]  and
[32:20.760 --> 32:24.840]  It looks like no other Mac we've ever made. It's an all new design and
[32:25.620 --> 32:31.160]  seemingly only one generation of product right like I don't think anybody thinks that
[32:31.160 --> 32:36.760]  The which we'll get to later in the show, but I don't think anybody thinks the Apple silicon Mac Pro is going to look
[32:37.560 --> 32:41.960]  Exactly like the Intel one. I don't because I don't think there's any reason to make it that big
[32:43.480 --> 32:47.080]  Yeah, I don't know. I mean we can I don't know if you want to segue into talking about that later. Yeah
[32:47.080 --> 32:52.040]  Yeah, let's let's let's put it put a tack in it. What do we look at lingo? I have some thoughts for sure
[32:52.200 --> 32:56.760]  But yeah, they said they this introduction so that you mentioned the modularity which I think is an interesting
[32:56.760 --> 33:00.840]  Thing to talk about because it's semantic, but you know, Apple loves semantics, right?
[33:00.840 --> 33:06.040]  That's one of their favorite things to play with when we were talking about the Mac Pro and when they were
[33:06.040 --> 33:09.640]  You know walking us through all of that because in the interim, you know
[33:09.640 --> 33:12.760]  There there was a sort of as we were talking about there was a sort of meeting where
[33:13.480 --> 33:17.880]  It's like hey, we don't know what we're gonna do yet or maybe they did internally but they weren't saying but we do
[33:18.040 --> 33:23.320]  We wanted to acknowledge publicly to our pro users that we see you we hear you yada yada, right?
[33:23.320 --> 33:30.200]  There's that hearts and minds situation there then in the interim they came out with I went to the
[33:30.360 --> 33:33.240]  HQ and they were like, hey, we went and talked about this
[33:33.240 --> 33:34.920]  We want to know if you want to talk to this team
[33:34.920 --> 33:38.760]  We've built this new team and that's the pro pro workflows team, right?
[33:38.920 --> 33:43.320]  And that was the first time they had talked about it publicly it honestly don't think it had been formed that
[33:43.640 --> 33:49.880]  Much prior to me talking to them like they clearly were doing work and they it had existed for a while
[33:49.880 --> 33:54.760]  But it wasn't a thing where it was like, oh, we've had this for 10 years, you know, no, this is some new thing
[33:55.320 --> 34:00.120]  Where they basically were following on that same line or the same vein where they're saying
[34:00.120 --> 34:05.640]  Hey, remember when we said we were listening to you here's explicitly how we are listening to you, right?
[34:05.640 --> 34:11.720]  We have these people who do nothing but talk to professionals about their workflows and the way that they use Macs
[34:12.280 --> 34:18.280]  And we want to use that data to inform the design of new computers. Yes, including the Mac Pro
[34:18.280 --> 34:24.600]  Which is coming in 2019, right? Like that was their whole purpose of of they that's the message they wanted to get across
[34:25.160 --> 34:30.920]  And that pro workflows discussion had a lot to say about modularity
[34:31.240 --> 34:36.600]  Right, like we know pros do different things. They do different kinds of work. They have different needs. That's why
[34:37.240 --> 34:41.000]  We feel that modularity and the pro workflows
[34:41.640 --> 34:45.640]  Discussions are going to be integral to whatever design, you know
[34:45.640 --> 34:52.520]  We come up with for the Mac Pro and when they did it when they did announce it. It was very modular, right?
[34:52.520 --> 34:59.880]  They had custom cards. They had compatibility with external suppliers and external manufacturers of cards all this stuff
[34:59.880 --> 35:05.720]  And so at that time modularity very straightforwardly very clearly meant
[35:06.280 --> 35:11.880]  You can add in the components to this machine that make it work for you
[35:11.880 --> 35:19.640]  Make it work for you. That's what modular meant semantically to Apple and or at least in their public messaging at that time, right?
[35:20.360 --> 35:26.760]  Now, what does it mean now, right because the same word is being used to talk about
[35:27.320 --> 35:33.320]  Mac Studio and I think it's very interesting curious to hear what you that you think about this, but I think that now
[35:33.800 --> 35:36.200]  very clearly in their minds modular means
[35:36.200 --> 35:43.720]  you have a desktop unit which has some customizability to it and configurability and then you have a monitor and that's
[35:44.040 --> 35:49.000]  Modular and then of course that's supported by a lot of external supports which also supports
[35:49.640 --> 35:57.980]  Modularity like external devices being plugged in right and so like their their version or their definition and positioning of modularity
[35:58.600 --> 36:00.200]  has
[36:00.200 --> 36:06.840]  Evolved I guess you'd say, you know, I'm so curious to see what you thought about that. Yeah, I think I know
[36:07.320 --> 36:10.760]  I think a lot of people make too big a deal over
[36:11.400 --> 36:14.600]  Johnny Ive's singular influence on their design
[36:15.160 --> 36:21.080]  And I know that sounds that sounds hyperbole to say that he you know that you can overstate his influence
[36:21.400 --> 36:23.400]  but I think when it comes to
[36:24.520 --> 36:26.200]  the
[36:26.200 --> 36:31.080]  The thermal corner the Mac got painted in a decade ago that we're talking about
[36:31.320 --> 36:37.000]  I I really don't think you can lay that at Johnny Ive's feet. I think his influence was in there somewhere, you know
[36:37.960 --> 36:38.760]  and
[36:38.760 --> 36:41.160]  You know the trash can design
[36:42.600 --> 36:49.240]  Certainly it is it was super striking. I mean, I know people I know Marquez Brownlee posted a funny video where he was like
[36:49.240 --> 36:54.680]  Your move Tim Cook and he showed that he turned his old one into a planter, you know, like how can you reuse?
[36:54.680 --> 36:57.080]  It's a beautiful case. It really is
[36:58.600 --> 37:00.440]  But it wasn't
[37:00.440 --> 37:06.600]  It was an honest attempt at making a pro device like when you spin it around and look at all the ports
[37:06.600 --> 37:09.160]  I mean it was not like some sort of
[37:10.040 --> 37:16.600]  Johnny Ive's white universe. Here's this beautiful small device with one port on the back, you know
[37:16.840 --> 37:20.200]  To keep it as simple as possible. It was clearly intended for pros
[37:20.200 --> 37:27.160]  But somehow one of the things that I do think they lost their way on and the modularity to me really fills in that gap
[37:28.040 --> 37:30.040]  is
[37:30.040 --> 37:33.880]  That that the Mac market needs more than
[37:35.240 --> 37:38.280]  You know like two levels and I
[37:39.400 --> 37:45.740]  Famously it helped write the ship at Apple, but when when Steve Jobs in like 1998
[37:45.740 --> 37:53.420]  1998 I guess or 99 maybe it was when the iBooks the first iBooks came out the ones that were orange and
[37:54.460 --> 37:58.620]  Bondi blue and he drew the little simple four-way grid pro
[37:59.560 --> 38:00.620]  consumer
[38:00.620 --> 38:01.980]  desktop
[38:01.980 --> 38:09.580]  Portable right and there was one Mac for each of those things pro desktop was the Mac Pro or I guess the the power Mac
[38:09.580 --> 38:15.420]  G3 or whatever the chip was at the time the consumer desktop was the iMac G3
[38:15.740 --> 38:22.220]  The pro desktop was the power book and our laptop and the consumer laptop was the iBook
[38:22.220 --> 38:26.300]  there you go for Macs one for everybody go and
[38:27.180 --> 38:30.940]  You know, like the iPhone still has a grid sort of like that, right?
[38:30.940 --> 38:34.620]  It's it's a little maybe more than four where you've got, you know
[38:34.620 --> 38:40.300]  You can buy like an iPhone 11 or an iPhone 12 from last year to save a couple hundred bucks
[38:40.540 --> 38:44.860]  You can get the iPhone SE which was just renewed with the new chips
[38:45.340 --> 38:47.900]  if you really want the lowest priced iPhone and
[38:48.620 --> 38:53.100]  Or or which might be both you really want the classic home button design
[38:53.740 --> 38:59.100]  And then with the latest and greatest iPhone 13s, we've got a mini and a regular
[38:59.100 --> 39:05.420]  with with the two lens camera and then we've got the regular size and the max size with the
[39:05.740 --> 39:07.900]  Three-legged or three three-lens camera
[39:09.180 --> 39:16.380]  Done and I feel like the Mac lineup inherently needs more spots and and they've really
[39:17.100 --> 39:19.980]  If you go from the silicon out
[39:20.780 --> 39:23.420]  It you you see that that's their strategy
[39:23.420 --> 39:29.260]  There's there's and it's funny because it's the last thing Mac users have always talked about right?
[39:29.340 --> 39:32.940]  Like we've never been silicon obsessed and I you know
[39:33.340 --> 39:40.300]  I can't tell you the differences between like the intel core i7s and i9s and i5s and why can you?
[39:40.780 --> 39:48.460]  Why can you configure an i5 that's so expensive? I don't get it. I don't understand it. Whereas the the lingo behind the m1
[39:48.460 --> 39:55.420]  Family to me is so clear. You've got the regular m1 and it's just great as is you don't need to upgrade at all
[39:55.420 --> 39:59.440]  and the regular m1 chip that debuted in november 2020
[39:59.980 --> 40:05.100]  Is a terrifically powerful cool fast long battery life
[40:05.900 --> 40:11.580]  Thing for macbook airs and the consumer 13-inch macbook pro. You can put it in a mac mini
[40:12.460 --> 40:14.460]  You can put it in ipads now
[40:14.460 --> 40:20.220]  terrific, then you go to pro and then the pro is for the
[40:21.420 --> 40:26.300]  The better 14 and 16 inch macbook pros, but then there's the max which again
[40:26.380 --> 40:30.140]  I I said this on my last episode with casey list the worst name
[40:31.260 --> 40:34.300]  For a for a podcaster, right? You can put it
[40:35.180 --> 40:41.660]  You put it in right? I cannot say you say max and it's we're talking about max max chips max, right?
[40:41.660 --> 40:44.380]  So you've got a max max. Yeah the max max
[40:44.860 --> 40:45.580]  But you've you know
[40:45.580 --> 40:52.780]  You've got these two extra tiers for pro laptops pro and then max and then you've got with the studio
[40:53.420 --> 41:01.100]  Two tiers the max from the laptops and then and one more level above it the ultra which is you know
[41:01.900 --> 41:06.300]  Clearly given how much copper two pounds of copper it goes into the studio
[41:06.700 --> 41:10.700]  It is not feasible for a laptop or certainly not a laptop
[41:10.700 --> 41:16.700]  Anywhere vaguely resembling, you know, the macbook pros that came out last year or earlier
[41:16.700 --> 41:21.100]  yeah, but that's like a clear each tick up that ladder is
[41:21.660 --> 41:26.540]  Clear performance wins and clear thermal trade-offs, right?
[41:26.620 --> 41:32.460]  Like when you get to the ultra and you find out that it yes, it fits in this seven inch by seven inch square
[41:33.100 --> 41:37.740]  Only three point something inches high, you know remarkably small box
[41:37.740 --> 41:44.860]  For the power, but you know, you find out it is two pounds of copper that the m1 max chips don't need for the same thermal
[41:45.500 --> 41:50.620]  Characteristics, you know, you're like, oh, yeah, you know that that's that's way too powerful to go into
[41:51.340 --> 41:53.100]  a macbook pro
[41:53.100 --> 41:57.420]  And there's clarity with that but then you get to the modularity and to me
[41:58.780 --> 42:05.180]  I still wonder why if if there's a mistake that apple made over the last 10 years that I really feel
[42:05.180 --> 42:09.340]  You can't pin it on the silicon apple silicon transition it to me
[42:09.340 --> 42:15.420]  It was just just just an own goal was getting out of the display game. They never should have stopped making
[42:16.060 --> 42:21.180]  27 inch displays and I know that there were issues in the early years with you know
[42:21.180 --> 42:24.780]  And retina is what we wanted what everybody wanted was a 27 inch retina display
[42:25.660 --> 42:31.820]  Just like the iMac but without the actual mac just let me plug anything into it and I know that there were problems were like
[42:31.820 --> 42:35.420]  Initially, they had to have two video controllers to drive the you know
[42:35.420 --> 42:42.140]  That's how you got all those pixels and they they just made it work and made it seem like one big display to the system
[42:42.700 --> 42:47.980]  And there might have been issues doing that with an external display over a thunderbolt cable
[42:47.980 --> 42:52.220]  But it was obviously technically possible at some point because LG was doing it right there
[42:52.220 --> 42:58.220]  You know and Dell shipped a 27 inch what we would call retina display, which they've cancelled years ago
[42:58.220 --> 43:02.860]  but that's the modularity that to me that they really lost for a few years there and
[43:03.420 --> 43:09.020]  Boger even said it to you in your interview with him that one of the use cases it's it's so super common
[43:09.340 --> 43:13.740]  For pro users is to want to take a macbook pro
[43:14.300 --> 43:18.540]  back and forth from their desk and just unhook a cable and go somewhere else or
[43:19.100 --> 43:25.660]  In a lot of scenarios. I know people who've worked in like studio and you know actual student lowercase s studio environments where
[43:25.660 --> 43:33.020]  Your office they you just set up a bunch of displays and as a designer you just carry your macbook around with you
[43:33.020 --> 43:35.660]  And you can take it home. You could go to a coffee shop
[43:35.660 --> 43:39.180]  You can go to a corner sit in a lounge chair or you can just go to one of these
[43:39.740 --> 43:44.860]  You know desktops or like a countertop and just plug it into any display and now you've got a big
[43:45.580 --> 43:48.140]  Real big display to spread your workout on
[43:48.940 --> 43:52.780]  And that's got to be super common on like movie sets and like
[43:52.780 --> 43:58.940]  That's got to be super common on like movie sets commercial sets anywhere where people are shooting video where people are
[43:58.940 --> 43:59.180]  You know
[43:59.180 --> 44:03.420]  You might want to start putting together a rough cut of the edit and you're using a macbook pro
[44:03.820 --> 44:07.980]  Because it's a dynamic situation. But then as soon as you can you want to plug it into a big display
[44:08.780 --> 44:10.140]  right
[44:10.140 --> 44:12.140]  yeah, I mean the the
[44:12.140 --> 44:15.340]  Idea of modularity referring to hey
[44:15.340 --> 44:22.860]  You keep a display for 10 years and you upgrade your desktop two or three times in that period of time. I think it's valid, right?
[44:22.940 --> 44:27.420]  I don't i'm not arguing against it necessarily. I just think it's it's worth noting
[44:28.300 --> 44:30.880]  That the definition has if not shifted
[44:31.560 --> 44:34.540]  Expanded and I say expanded because we don't actually know
[44:35.580 --> 44:41.180]  We don't actually know what the new mac pro is going to look like right and you you talked about that a little bit earlier
[44:41.180 --> 44:45.820]  So do we think it's going to have a bunch of cards do we not do we think it's going to look significantly different?
[44:46.060 --> 44:49.020]  Do we think it's you know, pci heavy, etc
[44:49.580 --> 44:50.540]  and
[44:50.540 --> 44:54.800]  That me if it is if it is then that means the definition has expanded
[44:55.980 --> 44:58.300]  to include both the original definition which is
[44:58.860 --> 45:04.860]  You can put a bunch of cards in this thing, right and add on a bunch of additional physical storage or or long-term storage, etc
[45:05.100 --> 45:06.380]  and
[45:06.380 --> 45:11.580]  It means a monitor right an external monitor and so like it's it's like the expansion of that now
[45:11.900 --> 45:16.700]  You could say look look the xdr was an external monitor. So the definition was already there
[45:17.020 --> 45:21.180]  I just think that it's interesting the way the the studio is being
[45:22.140 --> 45:27.900]  Positioned as something where hey, this is extensible. I think that the biggest way that it plays out is that
[45:28.780 --> 45:33.500]  Is the the performance right like the performance of this machine is so
[45:33.500 --> 45:35.500]  So
[45:35.960 --> 45:40.320]  Unmistakably better and more insane than anything else you could buy
[45:41.120 --> 45:46.000]  For the price for the average user for the desktop user that they actually get away with it
[45:46.480 --> 45:48.960]  Because of the performance because you're able to say
[45:49.680 --> 45:50.880]  Hey
[45:50.880 --> 45:54.640]  This machine is one you could conceive it'll be be using in in 10 years
[45:54.960 --> 45:57.680]  And you could just be plugging a bunch of additional things into it
[45:57.680 --> 46:05.280]  It's just got such just massive performance overhead, you know for for what it is and for what you can buy right now
[46:05.680 --> 46:08.160]  They this thing is sitting it's got legs, right?
[46:08.480 --> 46:14.640]  Like it reminds me like that when they were talking when they showed the performance charts and when you can actually compare the real world performance
[46:15.280 --> 46:19.360]  As we were doing our testing and all that and especially as we you see some of the ultra
[46:19.740 --> 46:25.200]  Benchmarks, which I didn't I don't have an ultra to test but as you see some of the actual real world tests of it
[46:25.200 --> 46:28.640]  It reminds me of that scene and I think it's uh, triple x
[46:29.280 --> 46:35.120]  Vin did this Vin Diesel movie. It's like kind of like a camp speed. You remember the scene. I'm talking about. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[46:35.680 --> 46:42.080]  I'm talking I hate to admit it, but I've seen the movie. Yeah. Yeah, and it's a when he goes there's a scene where he's talking to
[46:42.960 --> 46:49.280]  The Q equivalent, right? Yeah, there's always a Q equivalent because it's like a bond bond like like a roguelike of bond
[46:49.280 --> 46:55.840]  Of bond and he's stood he's showing him all of the different weaponry and he's showing them the car that he has for him
[46:56.400 --> 46:57.600]  and
[46:57.600 --> 47:03.840]  He basically says, you know, I want all of that in here, right? Like i'll take it all i'll take all the weapons, right?
[47:03.840 --> 47:08.800]  Just put them fit them all in the car and then he proceeds to use them all over the next the car chase, right?
[47:08.960 --> 47:13.840]  But that idea that you're just going to say hey, I want performance I want
[47:13.840 --> 47:18.480]  Power I want I want performance per watt. I want pure performance
[47:18.800 --> 47:25.280]  I want some modularity and i'd like the ability to have an external monitor that I like and it just you sort of get it
[47:25.360 --> 47:30.480]  All in there. It's very difficult to argue that this thing doesn't deliver on needs
[47:30.960 --> 47:34.080]  Right, and it's it's a very clear deliverable
[47:34.800 --> 47:41.440]  Situation that makes it very easy to sell and very easy to talk about. It's just a matter of how long it's going to
[47:41.440 --> 47:48.240]  Sort of last in terms of extensibility, right? And I think that's the argument the modularity argument people are trying to
[47:48.720 --> 47:53.920]  To wrap their heads around. All right. Let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor
[47:53.920 --> 48:00.080]  It's our good friends at back blaze. They're back sponsoring the show love this company seven bucks a month
[48:00.640 --> 48:06.880]  No gimmicks or add-ons or gotchas and you can back up unlimited backup for your mac or pc
[48:06.880 --> 48:11.040]  Your movies your music your photos your videos all of your projects all of your data
[48:11.600 --> 48:18.480]  All of it gets backed up to their cloud service seven bucks a month. That's it and you think well, yeah
[48:18.480 --> 48:23.360]  But i'm sure when they say unlimited that means like up to like one terabyte. Nope, whatever's on your mac
[48:23.360 --> 48:29.280]  It all goes up there. They have nearly two exabytes of data storage under management and counting
[48:29.840 --> 48:35.360]  That is i'm so glad they put this here because I have no idea what an exabyte is an exabyte is
[48:35.360 --> 48:39.360]  An exabyte is two billion gigabytes
[48:39.840 --> 48:47.120]  That's 55 over 55 billion files have been restored for customers over the years that backblaze has been doing this
[48:47.440 --> 48:49.440]  They have web restores
[48:49.600 --> 48:55.120]  For access anywhere in the world or or you can restore by mail
[48:55.680 --> 49:03.120]  Actual physical mail because you cannot beat the bandwidth of shipping like an actual hard drive or a flash key USB flash key
[49:03.120 --> 49:09.760]  They'll overnight it right to your door like you've disaster strikes. You need the whole thing like two terabytes
[49:09.840 --> 49:15.360]  You got to get it. You need it by tomorrow morning have them send it and they have a restore return refund program
[49:15.440 --> 49:17.440]  You buy the hard drive restore
[49:17.440 --> 49:22.880]  They ship it to you. You restore your mac you set it back up then you send the drive back to them
[49:23.360 --> 49:27.280]  Within 30 days you get a full refund so you don't even pay for the hard drive
[49:28.080 --> 49:30.960]  You get it you restore send it back to them get all your money back
[49:30.960 --> 49:36.240]  If you're worried about accidentally deleting files for an extra two bucks a month, that's it
[49:36.240 --> 49:41.120]  Just two extra bucks a month. You can increase your retention history to an entire year
[49:41.520 --> 49:45.280]  So like if you're worried that like, oh well, it's great to back everything up
[49:45.280 --> 49:49.280]  But what if I delete something today and then six months from now? I want it back
[49:49.520 --> 49:51.520]  Guess what two bucks a month gets you out of that?
[49:51.680 --> 49:57.680]  They have been recommended backblaze by just about anybody new york times mac world tom's guide nine to five mac and more
[49:57.680 --> 50:02.400]  I personally have been using them for probably like 10 years at this point long time
[50:02.560 --> 50:08.900]  They have a 15-day no credit card required free trial. Just go to back blaze b-a-c-k-b-l-a-z-e.com
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.240]  slash the talk show
[50:13.040 --> 50:18.080]  And that's 15 days. You have plenty of time to upload download some files. Try it out
[50:18.320 --> 50:21.360]  Seriously back your stuff up great mac software too, by the way
[50:21.360 --> 50:26.640]  It just runs on your mac and never ever gets in your way easy to configure easy to see what the status is
[50:26.640 --> 50:30.720]  But it doesn't interfere with anything. It just you just install it. It's terrific
[50:30.800 --> 50:36.640]  it's mac software by mac users for mac users go to backblaze.com slash the
[50:37.120 --> 50:41.200]  Talk show. Let's try to I you know, I I did I googled it
[50:41.280 --> 50:45.440]  It seems like vin diesel did not win a best actor award for triple x
[50:46.240 --> 50:48.240]  so
[50:48.480 --> 50:54.400]  No, I was worried I I don't think he I think it was he was robbed yeah here totally robbed
[50:54.400 --> 50:57.040]  Should have stormed the stage and slapped somebody because he was wrong
[50:57.040 --> 51:03.280]  That was that was his masterpiece before we get to the mac pro. Let's try to go backwards here
[51:03.840 --> 51:11.440]  And sort of fill in the gaps of where we think the mac lineup is headed as now as we head towards the end of the m1
[51:12.080 --> 51:18.720]  Series and go to the m2 and we even if we're talking about like mac books and consumer products
[51:18.720 --> 51:25.760]  And consumer products it you have to still talk about the mac pro because john tournes teased it at the end of the thing
[51:26.320 --> 51:31.920]  I guess what he said. I I hate to not have it quoted but basically what he said is with the m1 ultra
[51:32.080 --> 51:38.480]  We have our final chip in the m1 family, but we haven't completed the transition to apple silicon yet
[51:38.480 --> 51:41.520]  We have one more machine to come the mac pro, but it
[51:42.240 --> 51:46.080]  If the mac pro is coming like at wwdc in just a couple months
[51:46.080 --> 51:52.240]  And it's based on m1. It would seem as though it's using the m1 ultra or
[51:52.800 --> 51:57.600]  If they're doing something glued, you know, like put two m1 ultras together
[51:57.600 --> 52:01.360]  They're not going to give it a new name like the m1 extreme. It would just be
[52:01.920 --> 52:06.800]  Dual m1 ultras or something like that. Well, I give you know, maybe we should talk about the the mac pro now
[52:06.800 --> 52:12.320]  We'll save the mac book discussion for later. Well, I think look the studio just to like capra the studio is so
[52:12.320 --> 52:18.080]  Good, like it's very difficult to argue that it's not good. You can definitely have
[52:18.640 --> 52:22.560]  Well, I think a lot of people and we can I mean if you want to talk about display separately whatever you could talk
[52:22.560 --> 52:23.520]  We could talk about that too
[52:23.520 --> 52:28.480]  you could definitely have qualms about the display one way or another in in terms of its panel quality or
[52:28.800 --> 52:31.200]  feature set or or frankly lack of
[52:32.720 --> 52:38.400]  Ability to work properly, but the the studio is just really
[52:38.400 --> 52:42.880]  Just really good. It's really really hard
[52:43.520 --> 52:46.960]  To argue that the studio is not a good machine
[52:47.600 --> 52:53.920]  Your only argument you're gonna find from a lot of people is that oh I need more in terms of modularity, right?
[52:53.920 --> 53:00.000]  I have special needs and that's where the mac pro kind of steps in which makes sense. Like that's this is our missing piece
[53:00.000 --> 53:05.040]  They're saying we're gonna you know, get the m1 into this thing that we know some of you really need. Yeah
[53:05.040 --> 53:12.320]  Well, I kind of feel like that's my takeaway. It was a it's a delightful teaser as somebody who's a pundit and podcaster
[53:12.640 --> 53:17.760]  You know to because it gives us infinite we could just talk about this for hours literally
[53:18.240 --> 53:24.000]  The two scenarios seem to be either the mac pro is going to go to apple silicon
[53:24.640 --> 53:27.520]  between now and wwdc I would guess at
[53:27.520 --> 53:35.060]  wwdc if that's the case that I I really don't see them having an april event after having had a march event just to do
[53:35.060 --> 53:36.500]  the mac pro
[53:36.500 --> 53:41.220]  And then may you're too close to wwdc. I mean presuming that wwdc
[53:41.940 --> 53:48.500]  Will be you know, like the second monday of june or something like that the traditional schedule and you're talking about announce, right?
[53:48.580 --> 53:51.060]  Yeah, like that's my view announce then ship
[53:51.060 --> 53:58.980]  Q4 right or like september or october just say late say later this year give give give themselves some slack
[53:59.060 --> 54:01.060]  but that's sort of what they did with the
[54:01.620 --> 54:05.240]  The current mac pro back in 2019. They announced it at wwdc
[54:05.780 --> 54:11.700]  they had them there for attendees to to ogle and look at and they had this dude the
[54:12.260 --> 54:18.580]  Pro display xdr's were there on display for everybody to look at and they said these products will be shipping later this year
[54:18.580 --> 54:25.380]  And then they shipped later that year. I I would think something like that where they would announce the mac pro with
[54:25.940 --> 54:32.500]  Dual, you know are starting with it the m1 ultra and going up to dual m1 ultras
[54:32.580 --> 54:34.580]  I don't know what that technology would be
[54:34.660 --> 54:40.340]  I don't know why they wouldn't give it its own name, but there'd be some sort of you know, well beyond my
[54:41.140 --> 54:47.140]  Just about anybody's so you're saying basically you don't see them just saying hey m1 ultra
[54:47.140 --> 54:50.340]  Is what you get in the mac pro. I don't think it has there has to be something more
[54:50.420 --> 54:53.540]  I think so and the pattern that i'm seeing is
[54:54.260 --> 54:59.300]  With all of their pro max there's two tiers right and now there's not a lot of them
[54:59.380 --> 55:04.660]  But we've got the the macbook pros go from the m1 pro to the m1 max
[55:05.540 --> 55:13.300]  And the mac studios go from the m1 max to the m1 ultra so I would guess that there's some similar
[55:13.300 --> 55:18.900]  Look, if you just need the the the the least performance in the mac pro
[55:18.980 --> 55:24.980]  Which is starting from you know, race car level of performance. You can get it for whatever the price is for this
[55:25.380 --> 55:29.060]  But if you need more you can go up to this something like that. I don't know
[55:29.460 --> 55:33.940]  But if it happens in june, I would think it'll ship later in the year
[55:34.740 --> 55:37.960]  It'll let them announce it now and put up the benchmarks
[55:37.960 --> 55:44.040]  Where it still isn't getting beaten in single core performance by the nine hundred ninety nine dollar
[55:44.440 --> 55:51.640]  Macbook air running the m2 right right which is going to happen right the m2 right will have faster single core performance
[55:52.040 --> 55:55.960]  And it'll start to look weird. And so I always thought that the people
[55:57.160 --> 56:01.720]  Spitballing ideas of when apple is going to announce that the rest of the transition
[56:02.120 --> 56:04.440]  The people who are thinking that they could overlap
[56:04.440 --> 56:10.680]  The m2 with the m1 introduction because there were some people who thought maybe we'd see like new macbook airs this month, too
[56:10.760 --> 56:12.760]  We're running, you know
[56:12.760 --> 56:19.400]  Inter to every yeah introducing the m2 i'm not saying they couldn't do that and intel has obviously done that, you know and had
[56:20.200 --> 56:25.720]  New generations of chips that come out before the xeons, you know years before
[56:26.840 --> 56:31.400]  But why why if you were in complete control of it like apple would you do it that way?
[56:31.400 --> 56:35.880]  But I know that like german and mark german and I think ming qi quo
[56:36.440 --> 56:39.960]  And a few other people with their ear to the ground on the supply
[56:40.680 --> 56:46.280]  Chain side of things are speculating that the mac pro might not come till next year
[56:46.920 --> 56:50.540]  At on apple silicon that to me seems unlikely
[56:51.240 --> 56:58.680]  And again, I have no inside information. No sources. No little birdies, but they said, you know when they introduced the apple silicon in
[56:58.680 --> 57:02.140]  Wwdc 2020 they said it's a two-year transition
[57:02.700 --> 57:09.180]  And it seems to me like they've been firing on all cylinders even with those two years being
[57:09.980 --> 57:11.980]  Quite disrupted by covid
[57:12.060 --> 57:17.180]  It doesn't seem to me like they're going to miss that and I think announcing
[57:18.300 --> 57:23.980]  The last mac to go to apple silicon exactly two years later at wwdc
[57:23.980 --> 57:28.080]  2022 would would keep them right on schedule and
[57:28.800 --> 57:33.840]  You know make tim cook a man of his word that it would be a two-year transition and then ship
[57:34.640 --> 57:39.600]  Later in the year two years after the you know, the first round of m1
[57:40.480 --> 57:44.320]  Consumer max shipped so I still kind of think that that's what they're doing
[57:44.320 --> 57:46.160]  I have no idea how they're going to pull it off
[57:46.160 --> 57:51.920]  I guess the people who think otherwise are just thinking that if the m1 ultra is the
[57:51.920 --> 57:58.880]  M1 ultra is the last of the m1 chips, then what is what's left for the mac pro, right?
[57:59.280 --> 58:03.120]  I mean so they I guess let's scheme theory it right so the two
[58:04.240 --> 58:09.680]  most obvious options here would be either for them to offer an m1 ultra and then
[58:10.720 --> 58:17.680]  Some sort of m1 ultra quad configuration, right which the way the interconnect works, you know
[58:17.680 --> 58:22.800]  The interconnect is two chips, but it does not rule out them doing more, you know
[58:22.960 --> 58:26.080]  Like the architecture does not rule out them doing more. So let's say it's an
[58:27.360 --> 58:30.080]  They keep the letter of their word in that
[58:30.160 --> 58:35.280]  This is the last chip in the line by calling it an m1 ultra quad or something, right?
[58:35.520 --> 58:38.880]  Or m1 ultra times two right m1 ultra max
[58:39.040 --> 58:43.520]  But the other possible scenario is that they introduce the m2 with the mac pro
[58:43.520 --> 58:51.520]  Mm-hmm, right. Mm-hmm and say hey, this is the pinnacle. This is the new pinnacle and that way it doesn't get lapped for
[58:52.800 --> 58:55.520]  Eight months six months, you know what I mean in nine months
[58:55.520 --> 58:59.760]  I don't know how long you know before they introduce the m2 into the rest of the line out of those two
[58:59.760 --> 59:03.120]  I would say it's probably more likely that they do like an m1 ultra quad
[59:04.240 --> 59:09.760]  Personally, yeah rather than making the m2 because I think the m2 is such like a
[59:09.760 --> 59:13.200]  A nice watershed moment for them. They can use it to push their most
[59:13.760 --> 59:18.880]  This thing is not going to sell like crazy, right? Right, like they know that it's going to sell in limited quantities
[59:19.360 --> 59:26.880]  Comparably speaking so why not use their big marketing moment and their big watershed moment to introduce
[59:27.440 --> 59:30.240]  the m2 into like the macbook line rather than
[59:30.960 --> 59:35.520]  Using the mac pro as as that option. I'm just I don't think this is extremely lucky
[59:35.520 --> 59:40.400]  I don't think this is extremely lucky. I'm just kind of like talking out the theory right and so I think that that's
[59:40.640 --> 59:44.080]  That's the way I look at that and you know, especially considering that the m2
[59:45.760 --> 59:48.560]  Given patterns, right if we follow the patterns
[59:49.200 --> 59:51.200]  The m2 is extremely likely
[59:51.600 --> 59:57.920]  To have even more impressive power per watt ratings. It's going to be much more well received much
[59:58.560 --> 01:00:01.920]  The most well received in a laptop, right or in a portable
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:05.360]  Yeah at introduction. Yep. Yeah, and you know and
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:11.280]  The the idea I spitballed on my show last week with casey lis is just okay
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:15.520]  So we've got this footprint with the mac studio and it looks you know, you squint your eyes
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:18.400]  It looks like two mac minis stacked on top of each other
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:23.520]  But who's to say the mac mini couldn't get a lot smaller right that you can make you know
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:29.200]  Because look at how small cell an iphone is which I know it doesn't have the m1 but it's you know
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:33.840]  The a15 is you know, roughly, you know the guts of it. What's going to be an m2?
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:41.520]  I really think that they could make a mac nano for lack of a better name that is defined solely by the ports
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:46.560]  Well, what what ports do we absolutely need to have on this? That's how big it it'll be, you know
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:51.120]  Because it won't wouldn't need the thermals. It doesn't need a fan. It's so two usb-c's
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.320]  Yeah, two usb-c's and or maybe three if one of them's for power
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:01.600]  Something like that, right? Right, right. I don't know it it's but I do think the other thing too and again
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:05.600]  I don't know jack squat about the johnny suruji
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:08.240]  whole area of engineering
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.640]  of why
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:11.760]  it's
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:18.800]  The but the it just observing the way not just apple's chip team, but just the way the industry works you come out with these new
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:25.520]  Processes and you can say this is the the the world's greatest
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:28.720]  The world's greatest, uh, maybe they'll get the three nanometer
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:34.400]  Maybe it's like a new fi a new version of five nanometer for the m2 series, but it's a new process
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.960]  and the consumer level
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:39.360]  chips come first
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.560]  And then you you know
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:45.760]  it takes more time because you have to do that first then they ship first then a way to put two of them together and
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:50.320]  get a pro version that comes later and then there's four of them together and you get the max and
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:55.040]  You know and you you grow it from there, but it just seems like that's just the way the industry works
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.680]  It just yeah, so I can't see how they're going to have
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:00.800]  The mac pro version of the m2
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:04.800]  Ready that it just seems like that would be the last version, you know
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:10.480]  Which is why I think it's most likely to be like the m1 ultra quad or whatever
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:14.800]  The other ideas for the mac pro that would separate it from the mac studio because that's the other thing
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.800]  I I just want to say this it's is that the
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.320]  It's is that the the turnis teaser?
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:24.720]  For lack of a better name i'll always call it. Let's just call it the turnis teaser
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.040]  Of the mac pro at the end of the event
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:32.160]  I think one of the reasons is of course everybody who wants a mac pro has been waiting to hear about it
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:35.280]  So they kind of had to say maybe they felt like they had to say something
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:37.600]  But the other thing is if they hadn't said that
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:44.080]  People could reasonably look at the highest end config of the mac studio and say well, I guess that's the new mac
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:50.580]  Yeah, okay the ram the the maximum amount of ram you can put in is only only 128 gigabytes
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:56.720]  But compared to today's mac pro running intel, that's actually a very small minimum, right?
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.920]  The performance is good
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.920]  But you can't add gpu
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:05.600]  If you really just need I need all the gpu I can get and all I need a cpu for
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:09.760]  Is to run the software that runs the stuff that goes to the gpu. That's that's
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:17.120]  That's my pro task. You can't really do that with the mac studio you but but you could you could certainly believe that apple
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:20.580]  Might some version of apple in the multiverse
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:24.080]  Thinks that the maxed out mac studio
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:27.200]  Is is that's great for pros. That's it
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:34.080]  Right. So by saying but we still have one more to come it's you know, it's a way of saying this mac studio
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:38.640]  It's awesome. We know it's great for many pros, but it's not that's not the mac pro
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.640]  right, right
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:45.200]  So that would it's trying to tell people what version of the multiverse they're in, right?
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:52.240]  But that those would be those would be my two ideas for ways just broad broad strokes to separate, you know
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:59.360]  Well, why would somebody be interested in this hypothetical? Well, not even hypothetical gpu and ram in ram
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.840]  Yeah, that's that that would be my guess
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:08.160]  It is some kind of way and I know that all the ram so far in the unified memory architecture is
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:15.920]  on the system on a chip and it's shared and there's all sorts it must be fascinating how they've got the ultra to work with these
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.520]  bridges where
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:24.320]  Each of these they're like bridges between systems on a chip and each of the systems on a chip has 64 or 32
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:30.240]  gigabytes of ram max but they talk to each other in a way and do it fast enough that it that the system
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:37.200]  The software can see it as one big pool of up to 128 gigabytes of ram. My guess would be something something
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.880]  Where you can have extra ram slots and there'd be some
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.280]  penalty to pay
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.520]  versus the unified memory architecture
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:47.280]  but
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:53.840]  Compared to like today's mac pro or today anything you can buy on the x86 architecture
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.520]  It's not even a penalty. It's only a penalty that you would pay
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:01.360]  Compared to having it all right on the system on a chip
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:07.280]  And so if you really need a giga or a terabyte of ram, you can do it
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:16.240]  And there'd be like up to 128 gigabytes of ram that is unified memory and it's the very fastest and the system would just
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:19.680]  You know, it's sort of like swap swap space
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:23.760]  But instead of writing it to a disk you'd be writing it to even more ram
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:30.160]  Right, right. That's yeah ram ram to ram. So uma to right non uma swap
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:34.080]  I mean, that's what that's I think the the most likely scenario
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:41.120]  If you're talking about extensibility for a pro user and somebody says hey, I love one terabyte, you know, 3d files
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:44.720]  Right, and why why do you not have a machine that can do that for me?
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:50.800]  Because uma doesn't mean anything once like, you know 128 gigabytes of uma doesn't mean anything when I get to that point
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:54.560]  You know, I end up hitting slowdowns and this isn't a machine for me
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:59.280]  And so they could say hey you could do that and you'll take like a 10 performance hit
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:04.640]  But it's still faster than the fastest machine on the market right and you know and you you I i'm thinking that in theory
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:12.800]  You'd only hit that performance thing when you're doing a task a single task that goes past the 128 gigabytes
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:16.960]  Max of the unified memory, right right and so, you know
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:24.480]  Nothing, I do would ever go past that and somebody in the scientific community or doing some kind of crazy big render
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:28.640]  Of that that you need, you know, they have these examples now where they're showing
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:35.440]  You know that that that there are it's fanny pack versus backpack, right? Right like every most everybody's fine with their fanny pack
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:36.480]  They got the chapstick in it
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:41.120]  They got their keys and if you need to get in your backpack to get your snacks or your camp stove out
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:46.640]  It's gonna cost you time and energy and awkwardness to get there, but you've got it if you need it. Yeah, that's it
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:52.160]  I think that can that could work. Maybe that would be the name of the chip design fanny pack backpack fanny pack. I like it
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:58.080]  I I would really like to see I would really like to see johnny suruji. Call it a fanny pack
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:06.080]  Yes, it'll elaborate in a testing lab and say now here's where we developed fanny pack
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:12.400]  I i've never met him in person yet. I would love to because he certainly seems like a fascinating individual and you and I are
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:17.120]  Lucky enough in this racket, even though over the last two years we didn't didn't get to see anybody
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:21.200]  I would love to in these videos. I find it. So I I it
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:27.920]  Never ceases to amuse me how angry johnny suruji seems and and it he doesn't seem angry
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:32.720]  In in like he's angry at people it seems to me like he's just angry at
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:37.520]  people it seems to me like he's just angry at inefficiencies in chip design
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.960]  Right, that's who you want. You want to zeal it, right?
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:47.280]  It's like when I see a piece of hardware not performing to spec it makes me so mad
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:53.760]  Right when I find out that our our our most our our most uh devoted pro users
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.880]  Are shuffling all of this data
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:04.160]  From system system memory to gpu memory and paying a non-stop penalty back and forth with every frame
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:10.160]  They render i'm just furious. I can't I could not stand it. I couldn't sleep. I haven't slept in three years. I'm so angry
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:18.960]  right, right, but I do think I I because you know that then there's there's the and again it gets to that modular inside the
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:21.520]  Box as opposed to the box being you know
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:28.880]  The actual mac being part of the modular setup to a display ram would be one and then now here's where i'm really just
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:35.140]  Spitballing because I don't know what this would be, but you might have a better idea but something something expandable
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:37.040]  gpu
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.800]  where it's not
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:44.400]  Amd or nvidia gpu's which that that that story is over in my opinion
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:49.840]  That's that's an intel x86 architecture thing. It would be from apple, right but something
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:52.660]  Something where you can add gpu capabilities
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:56.160]  It inside the box
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:01.920]  You know, I don't know what the what nature would be something you could just plug in
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:05.680]  I mean because obviously the internal architecture of the chip is gonna you know
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:12.880]  Obviously you're gonna have the gpu on board which they seem to be in in early benchmarks to be very respectable, but they are nobody's
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.680]  research grade and or
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:22.500]  Or crypto mining and or high-end gaming grade gps, right? They're very good
[01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:24.900]  They're very very very good, but they're not
[01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:30.580]  Pinnacle right and it seems to me everything about this era of apple silicon is about pinnacle
[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:34.180]  Right, they they are no they are no longer saying. Hey
[01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:41.460]  Macs are amazing to use but you're not going to get the edge right because we believe the ease of use is better
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:43.860]  it's it's sort of like
[01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:46.580]  it's sort of like nintendo exiting its
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:49.220]  Gameplay era, you know what I mean?
[01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:53.300]  And i'm not saying it is or it should but it sort of feels like that in some ways
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:56.660]  But they are trying to do it without compromise. Obviously that that'd be the thing
[01:09:56.660 --> 01:10:03.540]  So it'd be like nintendo saying hey our new machine is twice as fast as the ps5 and you play it with your nose
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:06.020]  right, like they're not giving up on the
[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.620]  on the
[01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:09.620]  fun and familiarity
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:16.180]  Right, right, right the whimsy exactly and in apple's case their whimsy is theoretically ease of use, right?
[01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:20.740]  It's that's always been their thing. It's like hey, you know, it's accessible. It's easy to use
[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:26.260]  it doesn't get in your way as a professional and as a creative and that was what the the
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:31.880]  Attraction was to people who weren't in it to prove that they were good at using computers
[01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:38.100]  Right. I think there's a certain a certain amount of that and i'm not saying it's necessarily bad
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:40.500]  It's just it is what it is. I've been that person
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:46.820]  Right who was wanted to build a machine and utilize the machine and max it out just to prove that I could
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:54.020]  And just to just be like hey, i'm good at using computers. I'm I want to maximize my usage but in all reality
[01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:59.780]  Even if I build the best machine in the world, I utilize its maximum capabilities for
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.500]  Maybe a couple of hours at a time, right?
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:06.100]  Like i'm maybe a very high performance game right that i'm playing or whatever
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:10.180]  Most of the time it sits there and doesn't do shit. And so don't really it's not really all that important
[01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:16.020]  It's I did it because I wanted to and that's great and apple has generally shied away from that
[01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:19.720]  Like they're not in the business of doing things technologically
[01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:27.460]  Or in hardware because they just because they could right they want to do it in in sort of search of a user or a user's
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:33.460]  Needs and that has historically been the way that they go about this, but I think they're sort of exiting that era
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:38.900]  Not at least not in their minds. They would never say they would right because they philosophically they want to keep that but
[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:45.940]  You no longer have to say oh this apple computer is the best computer i've ever used. I just wish it was more powerful
[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:50.260]  You're not going to have to say that anymore. They don't want you to have to say that. So if you extend that
[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:52.900]  philosophy and
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:54.900]  Theory to GPUs
[01:11:55.140 --> 01:12:00.900]  Then it would stand to reason that they're about to get into the GPU game and the Mac Pro is where they begin
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:07.940]  Yeah, because that's the one the CPUs really do seem to stand toe-to-toe with anything else on the planet performance-wise
[01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:12.340]  And when you compare performance to what it really you really can't say they're they're the best
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:19.300]  I mean, it's it just hands down and yes, if you have some kind of legacy code, that's that's only available and would be a
[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:22.520]  Bear to port away from x86
[01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:29.700]  Sure, then your best solution still might be some sort of x86 system if you're got code that needs to run it or
[01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:35.140]  You know if you're running if it's windows-based, right? And what are the fastest windows machines you can buy?
[01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:37.140]  Well, they're still x86 and if
[01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:42.020]  Extricating your software dependency on running on windows is
[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:47.460]  Significant maybe you're starting the project. Maybe you're like, well, you know, maybe we've got to you know
[01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:53.620]  Hedge our bets here and start porting something so we can run to the Mac whether it's an internal tool or a commercial tool
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:57.300]  I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of companies are doing that
[01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:01.940]  Again, you know publicly available software or private internal software. It might be happening
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:04.180]  But in the meantime, you still need to do that
[01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:10.340]  But that the GPU story is still where you can't look at the the Mac studio
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:16.420]  with the ultra and say this is the highest performing GPU on the market hands down and
[01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:21.300]  I'm real I'm with you reading between the lines. I think Apple part of their
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:23.940]  last five years of
[01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:31.300]  Okay, let's rethink this back to the drawing board. Why aren't we the greatest computing performance company on the planet?
[01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:35.700]  I was trying to trying to explain to Jonas the other day talking about the Mac studio about
[01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:40.340]  like when I was his age in the early 90s the the
[01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:42.180]  the
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:49.380]  Workstation market and the PC market were completely divided right and that there are these companies and he's heard of them
[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:52.420]  I mean, they're not you know, it's I they've completely been forgotten
[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:55.700]  but like silicon graphics and Sun and
[01:13:56.340 --> 01:14:04.020]  You know and and that their starting price for getting like a silicon graphics workstation on your desk was like fifteen twenty thousand dollars
[01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:09.140]  In nineteen ninety dollars, you know, it's it was insane and Apple
[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:17.700]  Dabbled, you know, like arguably the Mac 2 FX which I think came out in 1989 and had like close to twenty thousand dollar
[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:23.700]  Price tag about that. Yeah, it was you know, like arguably, you know, like one time one Mac
[01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:29.700]  They sort of reached into workstation territory performance wise and then just you know
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:33.940]  Sort of you know as often happened out of it. Yeah, just sort of like a fitness start
[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:36.740]  and you know and then it it
[01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:44.100]  The x80 Intel and the x86 architecture sort of ate the rest of the architectural world until
[01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:50.340]  Arm came up from the bottom on performance per watt and and surpassed them but you know
[01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:55.620]  It it's easy to forget that you know, like by mm-hmm by you know, ten fifteen years ago
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:59.060]  all those companies were gone right, you know, they're right and
[01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:03.140]  Workstation just became not a different class
[01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:09.860]  But just the definition of the high end of PCs. It was still running the same operating system as a
[01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:15.460]  $400 consumer box you could get it Best Buy and you know, it just happened to be a
[01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:24.100]  $15,000 workstation with lots of RAM and you know some kind of crazy cooling systems. It's keep the GPU from
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:30.420]  Catching on. Yeah. I mean my definition of an Eldon ring machine was the previous definition of
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:37.940]  High-end workstation, right? I mean sure obviously with some concessions tool to my particular use case
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:42.980]  And away from things like banks of storage or redundancy and things like that, but at its core
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:49.540]  Performing, you know from a performance perspective. That's where we are. So that that that to me would be my
[01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:58.980]  I don't know how that would be with the GPU. But the other aspect of modularity is and Apple really seems to be doing this is
[01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:04.660]  Within limits and they're not going to do an infinite number
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:08.580]  You know, they're not going to have 17 different max to choose from, you know
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:14.180]  just a couple of form factors and then within each form factor a couple of tiers of performance, but basically
[01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:20.900]  Letting you decide where you want to spend your money and if you if you happen to know
[01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:26.660]  That you need as much RAM as you can get but you really don't need storage
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:33.140]  You can configure a max studio with a low amount of SSD storage and 120
[01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:38.900]  8 gigabytes of RAM or the other way if you need 8 terabytes of SSD storage
[01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:41.700]  Which is you know by SSD standards a lot
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:46.740]  You can get it and then you could just take the minimum amount of RAM on the machine, you know
[01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:52.820]  It's so there's you know, but I feel like the thing they don't have is okay. Let's say
[01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:55.540]  Whatever your business is
[01:16:55.540 --> 01:17:02.660]  Maybe it's aerospace engineering and you're you work at Boeing and you test the the the wings of the machine
[01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:07.540]  the wing stability of a new airplane design and it doesn't it's I don't know
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:10.660]  I don't even maybe that's I think that's CPU, you know
[01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:13.140]  Let's just say that it's a CPU intensive task
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:15.860]  You need gobs and gobs and gobs of RAM
[01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:20.580]  If you could configure a machine with a terabyte of RAM, you'll take it if you could get two terabytes
[01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:24.580]  You'll take that you know another forty thousand dollars. Just bill it to mr
[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:29.700]  Boeing but you don't need gobs and gobs of GPU. Well, then that should be modular
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:34.420]  You shouldn't be you shouldn't be forced to pay for like the world's greatest most
[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:36.980]  most performant GPU
[01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:41.540]  If all you really need out of a Mac Pro is RAM or vice versa if you're doing
[01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:47.460]  Some kind of crazy thing where you need as many GPU cores as you can possibly fit in a box and have the system see
[01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:51.540]  But you don't need a preposterous amount of RAM then you shouldn't have to pay for that either
[01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:56.100]  Especially not at custom build prices because that's what Apple's doing. They're custom building
[01:17:56.100 --> 01:18:02.980]  They're custom building people's silicon, right? And you know, obviously the quote unquote people that they are building this for are
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:10.820]  Theoretically a class of customer versus an individual but you are basically saying, you know, you're getting custom built
[01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:15.220]  silicon and so it's a bargain at twice the price is a funny statement, but
[01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:19.220]  In all reality you couldn't go to Intel because people have tried
[01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:23.380]  You couldn't go to Intel and tell them eight years ago ten years ago eight years ago
[01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:28.740]  Eight years ago. Hey, we don't like the way you're doing things like this is really annoying and frustrating
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:33.220]  And if could you like 2x this overnight, that would be lovely or overnight, you know
[01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:37.300]  But and they would just be like hey, we got a roadmap man, you know, like
[01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:45.140]  Chill and so Apple probably had those conversations and Apple's got a lot more clout than the individual user, right?
[01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:49.780]  I was so they probably went to Intel and said hey we want these things and Intel's like nah, you know
[01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:52.100]  We've got a roadmap, right?
[01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:57.940]  And they said all right, we'll just custom build it for our customers then right and that is a that's an interesting tack to take
[01:18:58.020 --> 01:18:59.940]  and if either if they're doing that
[01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:01.040]  then
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:03.140]  theoretically, they should be able to
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:09.540]  adjust twiddle those dials of like cost and modularity and capability in order to
[01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:13.380]  Make their costs worth it to develop these things
[01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:18.980]  But also not saddle a user who's never going to use them with the costs on their end
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:24.420]  Yeah, I and that's that would be a goal. I would think I I really do think that if Apple couldn't
[01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:30.260]  Convince Intel to steer their roadmap into into Apple friendly ways. There's no way any
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:37.460]  individual customer is right and I I think the best example of that is the long delay between the
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:44.420]  Pre-retina MacBook Air and the retina MacBook Air. Yes, and you know, I was told off the record by you know,
[01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:48.420]  Very good sources the you know, it was Intel's fault, you know that there was you know
[01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:53.700]  basically nothing from Intel that would let Apple build the retina MacBook Air they wanted to make and they had to you know,
[01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:58.660]  Even Apple had to wait until there was a chip that they could build the MacBook Air
[01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:04.260]  With a retina display that they wanted to and that they were proud of and thought was thin enough and look like the future
[01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:06.740]  You know and was moving in the right direction
[01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:13.380]  It was years behind where Apple thought it should have been in their hands, but you know wasn't their control
[01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:16.260]  Wasn't under their control which I'm sure
[01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:17.780]  I'm sure was the
[01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:24.740]  The big top-down impetus behind so much of this. I mean you have the bottom-up impetus of hey
[01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:32.260]  We can accomplish this and we can do this and where our silicon teams can deliver this which will generate sales
[01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:35.620]  But there's probably not probably explicitly
[01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:41.780]  Also that that whole layer of this is out of our hands and we never wanted to be out of our hands again
[01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:46.340]  Yeah, and I I don't know how how useful the analogy is and I know it's
[01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:50.180]  Extraordinarily unoriginal it gets made all the time
[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:54.660]  but it is sort of like being a consumer company like Honda or
[01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:58.020]  Mercedes Benz or Volkswagen and
[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:05.060]  Why have you know a Formula One team? Why why build race cars?
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:10.660]  Right, you know and and build these crazy engines and you know part of it is prestige
[01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:14.580]  and pride and that you maybe want to
[01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:21.540]  It's a magnet for engineering and design talent too, but I you know, I've always been open to the idea
[01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:27.940]  I know far less about cars than most people especially even including you I know because we've taught we talk about them a lot
[01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:28.900]  But I'm open
[01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:32.260]  I think there's got to be something to the idea too though that it trickles down
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:39.220]  Right, and that's something like the v-tech technology of my youth that Honda, you know debuted in like their race cars
[01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:45.780]  And then first came in the honda prelude which I always thought was like the best car name because they it was a prelude of
[01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:51.140]  Technology that was going to come to the accords and the civics and the cars that people actually bought, you know
[01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:53.780]  I I just think it's it's well
[01:21:53.780 --> 01:22:01.380]  I think the more proletariat and fall this loosely proletariat example of this at least at least more grounded is the Mercedes E-class
[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:07.860]  Mercedes E-class debuted I think three-point harnesses and side airbags and a bunch of other stuff
[01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:11.140]  A bunch of other stuff and maybe not three points so don't get on me car people
[01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:18.260]  But you know that they debuted a bunch of safety and security equipment that later trickled down the line not just into
[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:21.540]  Other Mercedes but into everybody's cars, right?
[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:25.140]  They they had to have it as standard from a selling perspective or whatever
[01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:29.860]  But if that high-end car with the additional expense hadn't existed
[01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:36.260]  It would have taken longer for those things to make it to market and that is you know, absolutely
[01:22:36.260 --> 01:22:37.620]  Proven to be a thing
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:44.900]  So whether you'd think of their prestige racing team as something where that is like a skunk works for new features or whatever
[01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:49.460]  It's certainly true that the high end of the line tends to debut features that become
[01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:51.620]  oftentimes
[01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:59.300]  Necessities or expected and then once the customer expects them and once it's become de rigueur or you know
[01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:04.420]  Part of the the fabric of what's expected in that class of car. It's unavoidable at that point
[01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:05.940]  It's unavoidable at that point
[01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:13.060]  Yeah, and I'll toss out an area that I do know more about which is cameras and that in the traditional camera market, you know
[01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:15.700]  You know Canon sells, you know
[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:23.620]  Thousand multi-thousand dollar lenses, you know for and and they've got some crazy lenses that if you don't know you need it
[01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:24.900]  You definitely don't need it
[01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:30.740]  But then you look at like the sideline photographers at the Super Bowl and there's there's photographers there with these
[01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:36.140]  Uh lenses that need their own little legs to stand on because the glass is so heavy
[01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:44.700]  Well, what did serving that market do for the consumer market who were for years and years and years were buying point-and-shoots
[01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:49.900]  Well it the technology did trickle down and stuff like autofocus and you know, yeah
[01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:57.980]  Autofocus especially is a huge huge thing and then most people don't realize that but autofocus was absolutely developed for the sports market
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:24:03.260]  specifically and available only in the top-end cameras of the time and then you know
[01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:07.020]  Definitely trickled down to a consumer point-and-shoot over the next two decades, right?
[01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:13.420]  And to the point where then once it came you it would be hard to convince somebody like of our children's age
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:16.380]  That autofocus didn't used to be a thing
[01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:20.220]  You had to turn the dial and trust your eye
[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:25.980]  And you know and they well and they'd have little tricks like the little thing right in the center would look sharper
[01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:29.980]  If the thing in the you know, there were ways like die up. Yeah, but yeah
[01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:33.660]  Yeah, you just you know, you would just end up shooting a lot of out of focus photos
[01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:41.660]  Yep, and and of course like once the technology exists it gets refined and refined and refined, right?
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:45.180]  Because the initial autofocus was contrast based autofocus
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:52.220]  Well initially it was diopter based and then contrast based and then you move from there to pixel based which is the most common
[01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:58.480]  Uh methodology now still where basically on a pixel by pixel basis. It says hey do these two things match up?
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:00.720]  Right, you know and if they if they do they're in focus
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:07.520]  So there's just like lots of really interesting ways that that technology does trickle down. I do think that
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:12.800]  When you apply it, I mean to bring it back to the mac pro like when you applied to some like the back pros
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:15.760]  I think the gpu could absolutely be
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:21.120]  That thing for the mac pro because we're sort of working in reverse from that right now
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:27.360]  like the the macbook airs processor for for better or for worse, you know, or not enough for better for worse, but
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:29.920]  In general terms it's going to run the mac pro
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:36.160]  Right, like the mac the m1. Yes architected up and more powerful version, etc
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:41.600]  But a version of the macbook airs processor is going to run the mac pro and it debuted in the macbook air, right?
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:45.600]  Right, it would technically debut in the iphone, but we you know, let's just call it m1
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:49.520]  so that's backwards from where you would normally expect but
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:52.980]  but edge case like high-end performance
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:59.520]  You know edge of the envelope stuff is still out there to be conquered by apple and gpu's are a big big one
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:03.760]  And so I could absolutely see apple deep viewing like an apple
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:10.240]  G1 gpu in the mac pro and then in five years or three years
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:14.240]  You know, the macbook has a macbook air has a g1. Yeah, right
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:19.600]  Yeah, or or g2 or whatever the case yeah or a g something right the g, you know, exactly, you know
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:24.640]  they they used to use x to say that it was extra special, you know, the the
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:31.760]  A the a11x or whatever right they I could see them doing like the g1i or something like that
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:35.440]  You know tack an eye on to mean it's we took this great graphics
[01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:40.880]  Processor and shrunk it down to fit in your phone and it doesn't get hot and doesn't suck the battery
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:42.880]  Yeah, but now you can push you know
[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:49.600]  The two trillion polygons or whatever you want, right? Now you can play fortnite and max settings on your iphone and you know
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:53.200]  All right. Let me take a break here. Thank our next sponsors are good friends at trade

[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:32.080]  Do you think do you think the pro display xdr is getting revised? There's the craziest rumor was from that ross young
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:38.160]  Who's who's a display analyst who still thinks that there's a pro 27 inch?
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:44.160]  Apple display coming which to me seems like the most bananas prediction i've ever heard like
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:51.440]  I totally get the division between the mac studio display or the studio display and the pro display xdr right as you know
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000]  two three to four thousand dollars
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:59.040]  In price difference there and definite easily discernible technical differences
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:04.080]  But I kind of feel at the high end of the display market a lot of stuff has changed since 2019
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:07.600]  it's been a long three years for stuff like local dimming zones and
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:14.160]  Right, and and if you're in that market, it seems like you you know, you really want the best you want the least
[01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:19.040]  What do you call it bloom? You know, like when white text on a black background, you know
[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:24.240]  You don't you don't want to see any bloom anything else. Yeah. Well, once you do use i'm just i'm honestly glad that I
[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:30.640]  i'm glad that I I had tested the xdr so long ago and then sent it back so long ago that
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:38.080]  Tested the xdr so long ago and then sent it back so long ago that I didn't have it to compare because I probably would
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:44.320]  It probably wouldn't be much more bothersome to me, but i'm coming off of like a 2014 inch iMac
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:49.360]  And so that's why I didn't lean too much into the the display. I say look it looks good to me
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:55.840]  I didn't lean too much in display comparative and comparators because I have like an lg curved lg gaming monitor
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:31:03.120]  Which is quite good, but it's not it. I bought it for response not for you know, high image quality and so that's fine
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:07.440]  But then I have this 2014 iMac which has been my main machine for a long time
[01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:11.600]  And then I have this other display this studio display
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:14.160]  And so like the studio display to me looks good
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:18.880]  But I understand a lot of people were really bothered by bloom and all of that stuff and I get it
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:23.280]  But it looks great to me. I mean, especially in comparison to the 2014 iMac, which whatever, you know
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:26.960]  It looks pretty good and is fine for home use so to speak
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:31.440]  I don't know if there's room in the lineup for another one in between
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.360]  So are you thinking like 2,500 bucks? Is that what we're thinking? I don't see it
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:39.760]  I just don't I you know, and I get it that people want their dream
[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:47.760]  Display that ticks off every box they want and comes in at a reasonable price, but I feel like this is it I always
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:51.120]  I I think it's a shtick that the macalope
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:53.220]  pre perfected years ago
[01:31:54.020 --> 01:32:02.260]  Which would apply to mac criticism from the pc side and especially iphone criticism from the android side where?
[01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:06.180]  You know apple would announce a new iphone in september
[01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:10.260]  and the android side of the fence would be like
[01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:16.020]  Well, it doesn't have this and here's an android phone that has it and it doesn't have that and here's an android phone
[01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:21.940]  That has it and it doesn't do this and here's an android phone that has a you know, 20x optical lens
[01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:24.980]  But all those android phones are different phones, right?
[01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:30.580]  It's not like it's like so you if if one of those issues is your pet issue
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:36.580]  Then you could you could find a phone that had it but it's they'd speak that android has this that and the other
[01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:40.660]  But there is no one android phone that has this that and the other and so yeah
[01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:47.140]  And I break out the duct tape, right? Right. And so I sort of feel like the criticism of the studio display is like that
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:49.940]  Where it's like well, it doesn't have local dimming zones and it doesn't
[01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:55.380]  Have it's not oled and you know, it doesn't do hdr
[01:32:55.380 --> 01:32:58.660]  It's just a p3 color gamut and oh you could get
[01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:05.700]  This display that's 4k at 27 inches and it has some of these features and it's like
[01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:13.540]  it's like it none of them are saying that if your baseline is you want 5k resolution at 27 or
[01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:17.380]  27 inches or bigger. This is the best panel on the market right now
[01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:20.420]  They're you know, and no it doesn't have some of those other features
[01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:25.940]  but there are no there is no one display you can go out and buy that ticks all those boxes and
[01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:31.860]  27 inches with 4k resolution is just not it's not retina by max standards
[01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:36.100]  And I know the pc world is different in that regard and the way that high does, you know
[01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:42.660]  high resolution works on windows and I know that gaming gamers in particular aren't even interested in all those pixels because they don't want to
[01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:44.660]  push them, you know, it's
[01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:48.980]  It's it's criticism coming from people who I don't think get what mac users want
[01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:54.660]  Yeah, I mean, I think that the bad value crowd, you know in terms of the studio display is very much coming from that place
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:34:00.020]  I think you've kind of summed it up nicely that if their conclusion is a bad value don't buy this
[01:34:00.020 --> 01:34:04.420]  It's they're seeking the edges of the envelope in ways that people don't even
[01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:09.380]  Register the vast majority of customers for this monitor don't even register, right? Now
[01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:15.220]  I think there is a section of those users that should pay attention to that
[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:22.500]  Criticism and should judge, you know whether or not this is something that they want to invest in and that's the high end of that market
[01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:24.500]  Right. So let's call them the top
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:31.060]  10 percent of all studio customers right should really ask themselves like do I want the best image quality possible?
[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:35.540]  Do I want high response times does local dimming bother me and they should take those?
[01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:39.300]  Those criticisms seriously and make a judgment call based on that
[01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:43.140]  I don't think the vast majority of people are going to or should to be honest
[01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:46.740]  yeah, I will say update since my last episode of the show I
[01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:52.820]  said on the show that I would like to see the nano texture before I make a purchasing decision and
[01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:58.340]  My local Apple store here in Center City, Philadelphia doesn't have them on display King of Prussia Mall
[01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:02.420]  I think I said on the show 15 miles away. It's I measured it's 19 miles away
[01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:08.260]  My wife and I went shopping on Saturday had lovely time. It was such a nice like hey life is getting back to normal
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:11.940]  We're spending a day at the mall and having having a lovely casual time
[01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:15.780]  I did get to see the nano texture display and I love it
[01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:20.180]  It's I haven't ordered yet because I'm an idiot and I know they're back ordered and I should order it
[01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:25.700]  I should have already done it but I'm going to and it was funny because I was sort of thinking that because the Apple stores
[01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:32.900]  Have such pleasant lighting that it might be a bad environment to compare but it actually is sliding
[01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:34.900]  Yeah, but it's actually it was true
[01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:40.900]  It was actually terrific is because it's like you can absolutely see the lights reflected once you know to look at it
[01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:42.900]  And I knew it was impressive
[01:35:42.900 --> 01:35:48.260]  When even my wife who isn't picky about such things and if we had others shopping to do, you know
[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:52.820]  Bought other stuff. It wasn't like we went all the way out there just so I could look at the nano texture display
[01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:56.020]  Cuz in which case I would have had to go by myself not have surprised me either
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:36:00.420]  Right, but you know there was a bit of an eye roll at the okay
[01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:06.020]  You know, how long is this gonna take in the Apple store, you know, and we went in but even even we've all been there
[01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:10.820]  Even Amy was like, oh wow, this is totally I this is amazing
[01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:16.900]  I can't believe this, you know, and you know and again, it's not like the regular glossy finish displays look back
[01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:22.180]  But you when you look at the nano texture one the the decrease in glare
[01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:27.140]  Inside the Apple store is just tremendous and for me with the sunlight issues in my office
[01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:32.660]  I think it's great. I do get what people are saying that it makes it look a little less sharp
[01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:36.580]  but I haven't for my eyesight I have to take my glasses off and
[01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:43.060]  Really risk putting my nose up against the screen and I could see okay. I I see that this is not so sharp
[01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:49.700]  I see that this is not so sharp. I don't get that close. And so it's you know, I I think as a spitball
[01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:53.460]  I don't own it yet. And so I can't really give a first-hand review
[01:36:53.460 --> 01:36:54.820]  I only looked at in the Apple store
[01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:58.260]  But I'm confident enough that it's worth 300 bucks more that I'm gonna buy one
[01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:00.900]  I think that if you have really really good eyesight
[01:37:01.140 --> 01:37:06.820]  You could probably see a difference in sharpness and it might bother you. I totally get that but the decrease in
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:10.420]  Reflectivity is so tremendous. I can't I can't wait to get it
[01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:13.860]  Good. Yeah, I I don't think I really need it in my environment
[01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:19.860]  I've been I have the non obviously nanotexture for this display unit or this review and i'm trying to decide which one i'm in
[01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:24.900]  Order because I probably will order a studio as I mentioned. I'm on a quite an old iMac. So it's about time and
[01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:27.300]  I I do
[01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:31.540]  I do like the nanotexture because that's the one that's the xtr I have to test
[01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:35.540]  I had one to test for a bit and it was the the nanotexture and it's
[01:37:35.540 --> 01:37:42.200]  It's fantastic. I mean the no glare is like zero glare. It's not the typical non glare, which is like less glare
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:45.720]  You know, it's it's zero. It's like a black hole for glare, which is amazing
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:50.840]  but I didn't have it to compare against like sharpness wise I can't say that the xtr is just
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:57.960]  You know unfathomably good to most people, you know, they've never seen a monitor like this in person. It's so good, right?
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:01.000]  But it's also it's insanely expensive
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:06.680]  So it's never really on my radar as something that I would buy personally. I just can't you know justify it
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:11.560]  But you know the nanotexture part of it was so incredibly impressive
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:15.480]  It would be hard for me to recommend against for anybody who had anything but
[01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:20.200]  Completely diffuse no direct sunlight environment, you know
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:27.320]  Which fortunately I do have like I have windows that are behind my monitor to some degree and they're usually covered by you know
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:33.480]  Very diffuse blinds and there's just no direct impact on my screen from sunlight. So I don't get
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:39.880]  Those rays that creep across in the afternoon or any of that jazz where it would be absolute a must
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:45.000]  You know for me to get it so I don't I don't think I'm gonna buy I think I'm just gonna get the glossy one
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:51.440]  But I I think that that's a call people have to make purely based on does Sun touch your screw, right?
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:53.360]  I do remember at
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:39:00.560]  WWDC 2019 the the media we had like a hands-on tour after the keynote and they showed us stuff and and
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:05.800]  They were showing off the pro display XDR and comparing it to like Sony's
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:10.440]  $20,000 reference monitor. I forget, you know, there were a handful of other
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:12.960]  video pro
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:18.360]  Reference monitors that they had but they had it set up in like a blackout room
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:23.480]  It was like a room with black walls black ceiling black carpet
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:30.760]  Right and like I can totally see how if you're you know a pro film editor
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:36.040]  That's the kind of setup you want feels like home. Yeah, it feels like home. It's like you're editing Bay
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:40.880]  That's exactly what you want, but it was impossible to see the nano texture be no
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:49.000]  It was like you you could have like a mirror finish and you wouldn't be able to tell in that room, right?
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.360]  Yeah, it was one of those smile and nod situation. Ah, yes
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:40:00.040]  Yeah, the other my other takeaway from having seen the nano texture in the Apple store side by side
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:04.720]  It was right on the same table next to a non nano texture one
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:09.640]  so it was perfect for side-by-side comparison is if you didn't have the
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:14.320]  Regular one next to it to see the reflections and the glossiness
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:20.200]  The other thing about the nano texture is and I remember this now from seeing the XDR in 2019
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:27.200]  It doesn't look matte to your eyes like so I totally get why they're not calling it a matte finish
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:32.680]  It's not just calling nano texture nano texture to use fancy a very fancy
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:38.400]  $3 series of hyphenated words to just say matte because it doesn't look matte
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:42.880]  It still is kind of shiny and doesn't look rough to the touch or anything like that
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:46.240]  It just somehow looks like magically the reflectivity is gone
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:49.280]  Yeah, even though it's the front side of it that is
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:56.600]  Treated with by blasting it to create that surface. It feels like when you look at frosted glass from the backside
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:01.880]  Yeah, like you're looking at the non frosted side of it right still soft. Yep. That's a perfect way to put it
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:02.360]  All right
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:03.520]  I have one last
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:08.960]  Sponsor to thank and then we can get to the homestretch of the show and it's our good friends at member full
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:14.440]  Which is where you go to monetize your passion with memberships

[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:13.840]  You mean in what device do you think it's what do you think they're gonna do because
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:19.360]  The my key point that I said on the last episode with Casey is that I just think we haven't seen
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:27.120]  Custom designs for the MacBook Air or even the Mac mini that are built around Apple silicon yet
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:30.720]  We still have the the industrial designs that were based on Intel
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:36.200]  Right and in the very explained so in my discussions, I came over
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:41.300]  I probably mentioned this publicly at some point but the basic when you we may have even chatted about at the time
[01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:47.960]  But the basic idea behind that was they knew they were doing something so big and so aggressive and so risky with the processor
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:49.460]  they didn't want to
[01:43:49.460 --> 01:43:51.460]  screw it up by
[01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:57.340]  Trying to launch new ID and like having some like hinge or something be wrong, you know
[01:43:57.340 --> 01:44:01.420]  Like having an issue right that got in the way of the debut of the M
[01:44:01.420 --> 01:44:07.120]  Or instead they took a design that had been around or a keyboard and that had proven itself. Yeah, or the art
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:13.400]  Keyboard oh god, it's happened. Oh, right. No, it's happened. It's definitely happened
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:16.920]  It's overshadowed, you know what they're trying to do with the rest of the thing, but yeah, exactly
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:20.060]  they wanted to take a tried-and-true design that it had time to
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:27.840]  mature and had time that to shake out the cobwebs and understand what worked and what didn't with it and
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.300]  Then say okay cool
[01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:35.500]  Now let's launch our big new bet in the processor arena into this hardware and with this hardware
[01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:38.540]  Versus the opposite, you know, which would be like, I don't know
[01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:44.900]  Let's see what happens with new hardware and new ID and new processor and everything all at once which would have been
[01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:49.820]  Interesting and even more exciting than say hey, here's the same computer with a different processor
[01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:54.620]  But infinitely more risky and probably the right choice, you know to not do that
[01:44:54.620 --> 01:44:57.780]  It is certainly made to our jobs as reviewers easier
[01:44:58.660 --> 01:45:03.900]  Yeah, exactly. You're like same ID. Okay now about that process. Yeah, you know, yeah
[01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:09.660]  Yeah, yeah, it is nice to concentrate on that because it's like with an iPhone. It's like oh man. Look I got performance
[01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:15.900]  I gotta talk about these edges and how you know feels against my fingers and I'm talking about the damn color and you know
[01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:19.940]  Oh wait, but the processor and RAM and oh, you know, and it's like it's a lot
[01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:24.860]  It's a lot to juggle also makes it easier when you can concentrate, but I think it was also just the right
[01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:31.300]  Absorption level for the public too because it was like hey, I don't think anybody was really getting all
[01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:37.780]  Angry about the MacBook Air's design right? I think the vast majority of the public is like
[01:45:37.780 --> 01:45:43.620]  Oh cool MacBook Air still looks cool super thin. I like it, you know looks good. I'll take one
[01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:50.260]  Oh, and now it's like way he better and probably the most powerful computer you could buy. Oh sure. Sounds good, right?
[01:45:50.260 --> 01:45:55.620]  So I think from the public's perspective. It wasn't that hard to sell either. Yeah, and I think that you know
[01:45:55.620 --> 01:46:00.740]  People know they like the MacBook Air, you know, they know they like it
[01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:06.500]  So why you know that wasn't the complaint that anybody had about the MacBook Air once it went to retina, right?
[01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:12.900]  So right so wide right, right, right, you know, it's sort of like if it ain't broke don't fix it yet, right?
[01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:14.420]  Don't don't try to improve it
[01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:19.940]  But now I think we're I think we're definitely gonna see new industrial design and I really think it's a good bet
[01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:21.940]  Yeah, and I you know
[01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:26.980]  It is weird. I guess the thing that I think of when I when I think about it as a pundit is
[01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:33.460]  Is it a little bit weird that it at least for this first transition from M1 to M2?
[01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:39.460]  It's a full two-year cycle as it appears to be is that right? Is it weird that okay?
[01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:48.020]  November of 2020 they came out with the MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro and a Mac Mini with the M1 chips and
[01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:55.860]  Everybody reviewed them and raved about the performance and that the software experience was just seamless and even if you were running
[01:46:56.500 --> 01:47:02.100]  Mac apps that hadn't been updated yet the the Rosetta 2 did it just a terrific job
[01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:04.740]  You probably won't even notice just terrific
[01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:07.380]  But then they're still
[01:47:07.700 --> 01:47:14.260]  untouched unchanged unmodified untweaked for two years is is two years permanently the cycle of
[01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:20.180]  It I feel like it could be you know, like it because it seems like if they've got this whole
[01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:24.420]  suite of chips to go from the regular M
[01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:27.300]  1 the M2
[01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:34.740]  A couple years from now the M3 but then they're gonna have a pro version. That's higher performance and then max and then ultra
[01:47:35.540 --> 01:47:39.780]  You know that it seems like two years might be the normal cycle
[01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:44.740]  For this, I I don't know. Is that weird?
[01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:50.020]  I don't think so. I think for a while. I think this that's the thing about these things you make these
[01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:55.060]  You know, let's call them proclamations right or prognostications better
[01:47:55.220 --> 01:48:01.780]  So you make these prognostications about the lineup and I think all too often we fall into this trap of like here's what it here's the new
[01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:02.900]  way of being
[01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:04.260]  perpetuity right because everybody likes to make a good
[01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:10.980]  grandiose statement, but I think this is a pretty unique transition, right? It's a pretty unique transitionary period in apple's
[01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:18.660]  Timeline of everything they've done before i'm gonna think about being intel for 30 plus years and then having
[01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:25.060]  You know a change into your own processing architecture and and taking control and saying hey
[01:48:25.060 --> 01:48:28.820]  We're launching our own chips and we've got to obviously produce all of them
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:35.780]  and and put them all into our own hardware and market them and sell them and make sure that they work right and all of that stuff
[01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:40.740]  I just think it's too much of a black swan to say let's here's the new pattern
[01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:47.940]  So maybe the first launch of it is two years and then the thereafter it's whenever the new chips are ready
[01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:52.980]  Right, and maybe that's one year. Maybe it's three years. I don't think that they're under any pressure
[01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:58.820]  Because I think that previously the pressure was exerted externally people would say. Oh the new intel chips are here
[01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:03.300]  When are the new macbooks coming with those intel chips in them because i'm going to wait for that?
[01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:06.340]  And I think that that external market pressure
[01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:12.340]  Definitely drove a lot of their cadence as much as they would like to say it probably didn't it's you know
[01:49:12.340 --> 01:49:14.340]  It drives some of it for sure
[01:49:14.660 --> 01:49:16.980]  And so I think that that's now they're sort of like
[01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:23.380]  Are able to chart their own course and it's going to be a matter of
[01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:30.020]  Hey, when do we think we can ship a meaningful update that will move the needle on sales and that obviously there's internal pressures there
[01:49:30.020 --> 01:49:35.780]  But they don't have this external pressure. So I think it's sort of a we have to wait in the sea rather than oh
[01:49:35.780 --> 01:49:38.580]  This is the new pattern. It could be two years. Absolutely
[01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:42.340]  Stands to reason makes sense. It'll trickle down through the line. There's a lot of
[01:49:42.340 --> 01:49:48.100]  They'll shake out the kinks and then they'll launch a quad or or or dual configuration or more powerful configuration
[01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:53.700]  I could see that happening definitely through m2, maybe even m3, but it's sort of all bets are off really
[01:49:54.340 --> 01:50:01.300]  Yeah, and the other thing too is it it could I think they could get away with the two-year cycle for a few generations
[01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:03.540]  If that's the plan
[01:50:03.540 --> 01:50:05.540]  assuming that each new
[01:50:05.540 --> 01:50:08.020]  added add an integer going from the original
[01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:15.060]  Assuming that each new added add an integer going from the m1 to m2 is fairly significant
[01:50:15.140 --> 01:50:19.620]  And in terms of its wow, this is actually, you know, you thought the m1 was good. Well now look at this
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:24.020]  It's even more efficient and faster. It's you know, it's enough of an upgrade
[01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:31.080]  Where they still maintain their their lead that they've established over the rest of the industry and performance
[01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:36.820]  You know, they're not by doing it once every you know, a new refresh of the whole lineup every two years
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:42.660]  isn't giving the competition room to catch up if each additional generation is enough of a
[01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:48.420]  Within the apple silicon world is a big upgrade. The other thing I look at though pattern wise
[01:50:49.060 --> 01:50:50.420]  is
[01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:53.700]  it's it's the iphone that has sort of
[01:50:54.580 --> 01:50:58.260]  spoiled at least my mind into thinking that the
[01:50:58.980 --> 01:51:03.780]  the ultimate goal if everything works as planned and is
[01:51:03.780 --> 01:51:10.920]  Nothing goes wrong is annual right that once a year every september unless there's a global pandemic
[01:51:10.980 --> 01:51:14.660]  In which case it's only delayed by a month and it's october
[01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:22.420]  There's a new generation of iphones and that there's a steady series of improvements every single year that you can notice and sure
[01:51:22.980 --> 01:51:24.980]  If you upgrade every single year
[01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:31.220]  you don't really notice that much of a difference going from the iphone 11 to the 12 or the 12 to 13, but
[01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:38.340]  By doing it every year when like a normal person you go from an iphone 10s to an iphone 13
[01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:42.660]  You're like wow, this is way faster and the battery lasts longer and it's really nice
[01:51:42.900 --> 01:51:47.380]  but that that one year cycle for the phone that that's the phone being the phone and the the
[01:51:47.780 --> 01:51:55.060]  The 1 billion users around the planet thing it I look at the ipads which are mostly on like an 18 month cycle
[01:51:55.220 --> 01:51:59.220]  Right, it's it's not like clockwork like the phones where you could say the month
[01:51:59.220 --> 01:52:01.220]  Of when they're going to announce them
[01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:03.220]  But you know the the ipad pros
[01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:11.140]  Every 18 months or so. There's a new generation of ipad pros and the the new ipad air that came out this month
[01:52:11.940 --> 01:52:17.540]  You know was last updated like a year and a half ago and now it's on the so presumably like one one way to look at it
[01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:24.020]  Is it if you just say well now that the high-end ipads are also using the m series chips
[01:52:24.020 --> 01:52:29.700]  You know the ipad pros and the ipad air are on the m1 if the m1 is a two-year cycle
[01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:36.100]  Then that would mean the ipads are a two-year cycle too, right because presumably the next ipad pro is going to have the m2
[01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:40.180]  It's not you know, what what are they going to do give it's here's a new ipad pro
[01:52:40.180 --> 01:52:42.820]  But it still has the m1 that doesn't really make any sense
[01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:49.460]  so, you know, I I don't I guess so that part of me just looking at the pattern would say maybe
[01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:56.260]  Now that they've got their feet under them and they sort of had the first generation out the door and did it again during during a
[01:52:57.060 --> 01:53:02.740]  A pandemic that somewhat disrupted the supply chain globally 18 months might be like the sort of goal
[01:53:03.140 --> 01:53:08.740]  That's it's just a pure speculation on my part. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah 18 months to even 20
[01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:11.300]  When is a macbook? So the macbook air
[01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:14.500]  Was introduced
[01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:20.660]  March 2020 i'm like wait the macbook air that yeah the macbook air the m1 macbook air. No
[01:53:21.380 --> 01:53:26.180]  No, no, november 2020 november 20. Thank you. Okay. Yeah, so november 2020
[01:53:28.020 --> 01:53:30.020]  Let's just let's let's
[01:53:30.660 --> 01:53:32.660]  metagame it
[01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:36.520]  Imagine you're you're in november of 2022
[01:53:37.380 --> 01:53:41.860]  Like does november of 2022 that feels really long. Yeah, that's a good idea
[01:53:41.860 --> 01:53:45.620]  November of 22 that feels really long. Yeah to me. It feels long
[01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:51.320]  It feels long. So it feels much more like q1 2020
[01:53:53.620 --> 01:53:55.620]  So
[01:53:56.020 --> 01:54:01.140]  That's that's hard it's interesting 18 months well 18 months would put it two months away right right right
[01:54:01.780 --> 01:54:06.500]  Yeah, so I don't know, uh, you know, you know, and maybe you know, so maybe they come out with the m
[01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:14.420]  M2, I mean, you know, what's two months away? I know wwdc. So maybe and theoretically a back throw, right?
[01:54:14.980 --> 01:54:18.020]  Right. So it's weird. I don't think it's a weird one. Yeah, you know
[01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:23.060]  Maybe the mac pro is the m2 launch. I mean, I know I just argued against it three seconds ago
[01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:29.380]  Right, I don't know would you have to if they announced the m2 macbook air at wwdc in two months?
[01:54:29.460 --> 01:54:34.820]  Would I would I have to go to the fainting couch? No, but I would just be pleasantly surprised and just think wow
[01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:38.420]  They're right. They're really they're they're more on top of their game than I expected
[01:54:39.220 --> 01:54:43.060]  Yeah, so I mean like let's say if you go a full two-year cycle
[01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:48.660]  In my mind if they don't introduce it to wwdc it's not going to be until
[01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:52.820]  November. Yeah, that's sort of or october maybe you know october, right?
[01:54:52.820 --> 01:54:56.820]  Because I think maybe like in the fall of 2020 everything was a month back
[01:54:56.900 --> 01:54:59.640]  So the iphones didn't come you didn't get announced till october
[01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:06.600]  And then the max which I think if everything had gone according to plan probably would have been a mid-october event where instead
[01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:12.040]  Late november, you know, it's you know, and I don't think that I tweeted something about it
[01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:17.320]  Which is now gone because I delete all my tweets, which is so relaxing by the way, highly recommend. Oh, you're smart
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:19.320]  Yeah, I just I got tired of it
[01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:24.680]  it wasn't even like it's like I tweeted something ridiculous at some point as I I didn't but
[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:30.200]  I just got exhausted with having such an online presence all the time. I just tried to reel it back
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:35.640]  Anyway, that's another discussion, but I tweeted something during the event about like the a15 chips
[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:41.080]  Like are we seeing like this trickle out of the lineup? And I just don't I think the a series ships are around for a while
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:45.560]  Still, I don't think they're going anywhere. Yeah, I don't think so. Like in other words, you could say hey one way to debut
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:50.600]  The m2 would be in the iphone pro, right? You know what I mean? Right, but I just don't think that's gonna happen yet
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:53.880]  I think we're gonna see like an a16. Yeah in this year's iphone pro
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:57.720]  Yeah, so that would be my guess a16 in september
[01:55:58.360 --> 01:55:59.720]  and then
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:04.520]  The m2 which might be based on the a15 in terms of its core, you know
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:10.680]  and so like the bleeding edge of their new technology is always the a series chips in the iphones and
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:17.160]  Then the year later they come out in the m series and then over the next you know
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:23.080]  18 months trickle out to the pro max ultra tiers and that's yeah
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:25.080]  and there's some poetic and
[01:56:25.700 --> 01:56:27.700]  clarity driven
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:35.880]  Desire to see say the mac or the ipad pro and the iphone pro both have m series chips
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:40.680]  And then the iphone regular line and ipad regular line so to speak
[01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:48.040]  Have the a series chips like there's some sort of poetic thing around that and maybe that comes to pass at some point
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:50.840]  You know where like an iphone 14
[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:55.640]  Has just non-pro has an a16 but the iphone
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:57:00.600]  Pro 14 pro has an m, right?
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:03.960]  Well, the the rumor somebody had was that the a
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:09.500]  What wait what's the next chip going to be the a16 a15
[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:17.480]  What are we at? No a16 a16 right is only going to be in the pros and that the non-pros will still have the a15
[01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:22.680]  That's a year old which is the same same thing. Yeah, it's the same thing. I mean, it's really a marketing exercise
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:29.320]  But the other thing that the one last point I want to I want to just get out before we wrap up and finish the show
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:37.160]  Is that the one thing I think we're done with from apple across the board is the concept of speed bump updates, right?
[01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:43.480]  You know that like well, we don't have a major redesign of this product, but you know, we're going to go from
[01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:49.340]  You know this many gigahertz to slightly more gigahertz in the processor
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:51.880]  or a slight upgrade
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:59.960]  In the type of ram that it accepts or something like that or the one we've seen more re in more recent years
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:06.280]  Is like midway through the cycle of like a mac 16 inch macbook pro they'd come out with a new gpu option
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:07.720]  Everything else is the same
[01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:13.640]  But now if you want the highest end pro gpu in a macbook, you could you can get a new option
[01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:18.600]  I think that those days are over because of the integration of the systems on a chip
[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:23.080]  But I think that's a good thing. I know that it's every time
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:31.000]  Things like that that that people of our generations grew up with thinking that's how computers are if you just wait six months
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.920]  There's like a speed bump
[01:58:32.920 --> 01:58:34.920]  I think it's actually better
[01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:40.600]  And more it's it's easier to shop and buy decide what to buy when you know, okay
[01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:43.880]  They came out with it. They just came apple just came out with a new macbook air
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:46.600]  If you think it looks good buy it because you know
[01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:49.800]  They're not going to come out with a new one nine months later that makes you regret it
[01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:52.520]  And if you're late in the cycle
[01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:57.960]  Like right now today as we're recording if you're in the market for a macbook air you you know
[01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:01.960]  You can feel reasonably certain that if you can put off your purchase till
[01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:04.840]  You know the end of the year you're probably going to see new hardware
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.560]  You know what you're getting if you buy a macbook air today
[01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:13.960]  Yeah, and that you know, the externalities had a lot to do with that obviously as we talked about a little bit the intel
[01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:18.680]  You know kind of saying hey, we have we have new chips and apple saying okay cool
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:25.080]  We can build a new you know, we could put build a speed bump around that right right ship it mid-year and get a sales bump
[01:59:25.160 --> 01:59:29.880]  And you know provide users with an additional reason to buy or whatever like if that rationale goes at the window
[01:59:29.880 --> 01:59:31.880]  Apple can confidently
[01:59:31.880 --> 01:59:32.840]  offer
[01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:36.600]  A powerful machine that as you said like as long as they maintain their power delta
[01:59:36.760 --> 01:59:42.920]  They could say that look this is better than any laptop you can buy pretty much right right now and for the next six months
[01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:46.600]  Easily the best laptop you can buy and another thing it does of course
[01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:52.280]  On the supply chain is it adds an enormous amount of predictability and cost effective, you know cost efficiencies
[01:59:52.840 --> 01:59:56.120]  So, you know, that's good good good. Yeah, so to speak
[01:59:56.120 --> 02:00:00.040]  Yeah, and I you know, and is it the tim kook influence on the culture?
[02:00:00.200 --> 02:00:03.720]  I don't know. You can't say it's not right that that a supply chain
[02:00:04.280 --> 02:00:08.680]  You know by all accounts wizard is now has been the ceo now for over a decade
[02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:14.760]  And that they've evolved all of their product lines into a more supply chain friendly pattern
[02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:18.120]  you know it's yeah, I mean look so you you
[02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:21.880]  You want to workshop that conversation right and the conversation is?
[02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:27.640]  Like you have a tournes or a vedry or or that cadre of of leadership group
[02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:31.720]  And they're having the meeting and they're talking in the boardroom and they're like we want to you know
[02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:33.720]  We got to get out from in the intel's thumb
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:35.880]  We want to do all these cool things that we can't do
[02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:41.480]  With intel the chip team tells me that they're confident that they can ship an iphone processor
[02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:44.920]  In a macbook and if we scale it up and we do thermals, right?
[02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:50.520]  It's just as powerful and in fact is way more powerful if we do it, right? We know this let's do it
[02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:54.600]  Let's go for it. And then tim comes in and says like now tell me
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:01:01.560]  If we went all out, you know and took a year to develop it and make it the most powerful chip you could possibly buy
[02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:09.880]  Could we ship one and we'll have it last for two years because in the second half of that lifespan i'll make double
[02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:16.280]  You know, we'll make we'll make double on the chip right on and obviously less than that overall profit margin
[02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:23.640]  But you can imagine the profit margin going from twenty seven percent on the front end to thirty eight percent on the back end
[02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:30.120]  Right or whatever, you know, and I mean that's probably a big swing but you get the idea and like that that second
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:34.040]  Half of that 24 month cycle they'd make a killing
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:39.720]  And you know, that's where they get their additional growth out of in terms of the shareholder value, right?
[02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:43.720]  You know that what the shareholders want to see right and they can stand behind the product and say you
[02:01:43.720 --> 02:01:49.560]  that the customer who's buying a new macbook air 18 months after it was introduced
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:53.800]  You're still getting a terrific product, you know, it's a it's a great product
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:02:00.200]  It'll be good for years to come but if you buy an old macbook air the day before the new ones announced, right?
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:06.120]  Yes, you're not getting the new one, but you're still getting a better machine than everybody else is shipping for another six months to eight months
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:12.120]  Yeah, and i'm sure that like that conversation, you know, but I but I really am i'm sure that the way you put it
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:15.880]  It's music to tim cook's ears. I'm sure
[02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:19.000]  he probably does I I just
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  Guess that he's not a you know, he's a gregarious person on stage
[02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:28.680]  I think he's you know, I think you have those meetings with him like a monday morning, you know executive meeting
[02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:32.360]  I I can't help but think that that you know, you think we could do this for you know
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:35.080]  A two-year cycle that a smile cracks his face
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:40.440]  It's like the heavens part
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:44.840]  Anyway, that was great. I thank you matthew for your time as always
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:50.840]  It's always always fun catching up to you catching up with you. Hopefully in person sometime soon ish
[02:02:51.080 --> 02:02:55.560]  Yeah, it'd be nice. That'd be good. Wouldn't it be a little return to return to friendly faces?
