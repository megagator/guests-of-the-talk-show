[00:00.000 --> 00:07.180]  Nothing going on this August. I don't know. It's like the worst DC Universe movie ever and I'm just afraid what the Snyder cuts gonna be
[00:08.940 --> 00:16.100]  What's going on with that thing that's that's crazy right is that nuts I only following that loosely and it's like I
[00:16.980 --> 00:21.620]  Have I'm like the rare person like and I think that this is going to be the theme of the episode
[00:21.740 --> 00:26.400]  Is that we're going to talk about a lot of things that have very polarizing opinions
[00:26.400 --> 00:33.800]  Yeah, and Zack Snyder seems to be a very polarizing filmmaker and my take on Zack Snyder is sort of in the middle
[00:34.300 --> 00:39.540]  Like I feel like I'm like the one fan of superhero movies who's like, I guess I mostly like them
[00:39.540 --> 00:41.740]  But I kind of see why you know, he's yes
[00:42.580 --> 00:45.900]  No, I think to me it highlights exactly what you said except
[00:46.540 --> 00:48.420]  Everybody can be wrong is my takeaway
[00:48.420 --> 00:52.620]  I think Twitter hates the idea that multiple people can be right and or wrong
[00:52.620 --> 00:57.700]  They want a clear-cut, you know sides on everything, but I think Justice League was a bad movie
[00:57.700 --> 01:02.540]  And I think the Snyder cut it's gonna be a bad movie. I can't remember I honest to God. This is the truth
[01:02.540 --> 01:04.540]  I can't remember if I watch Justice League
[01:06.180 --> 01:09.140]  Like I like the Superman movie I didn't love it
[01:09.140 --> 01:15.020]  I don't still don't think I still think that the only good Superman movie ever made was Richard Donner's original
[01:15.020 --> 01:17.860]  Yes, man, still think it was the only one
[01:17.860 --> 01:26.180]  But I kind of like the moments of Zack Snyder's and you know, and it's like what a bold move
[01:26.180 --> 01:31.740]  just doing away with the theme music and going with a new one and it worked for me and I you know,
[01:32.300 --> 01:36.340]  Kind of like the the feel of it, which to me is often a lot more important
[01:36.780 --> 01:43.020]  But then you know, it's stuff falls apart. So anyway, the whole thing with the Zack Snyder cut of the movie is that
[01:43.020 --> 01:49.660]  He's making Justice League a couple years ago. Something happens in his personal life. I don't
[01:50.220 --> 01:51.900]  I don't know things there was like
[01:51.900 --> 01:58.620]  DC the DC brass decided they didn't want him doing this anymore because his previous movies were doing so badly both
[01:58.620 --> 02:01.020]  you know not in terms of box office, but in terms of
[02:01.020 --> 02:08.220]  Public reaction and then his father passed away and they sort of used that as a way to move him aside in the middle of production
[02:08.220 --> 02:13.580]  In the middle of production who'd made the X the Avengers right, but that's in the middle of production. Yes
[02:13.740 --> 02:22.060]  Yeah, or maybe more than past the middle of production. Yes. It was before the reshoots, right and Joss Whedon isn't just a
[02:23.220 --> 02:26.820]  Director if anything he's better known as a writer. I mean, he's a filmmaker
[02:26.820 --> 02:30.260]  I don't mean to I don't mean to take away from his skills as a director, too
[02:30.260 --> 02:35.980]  And he's obviously helmed as director some inordinately beloved in popular movies, but he is a writer
[02:35.980 --> 02:41.340]  So, you know that he's not gonna he's not at somebody's just gonna come in and say, okay, give me the script
[02:41.340 --> 02:46.900]  I'll start I'll just pick it up, you know, and you know, perhaps contributed to it being a
[02:47.980 --> 02:49.060]  mismatch
[02:49.060 --> 02:54.180]  Mishmash and now the cast are coming forward and just saying he was terrible and the producers were terrible and the whole thing was a
[02:54.180 --> 02:59.740]  Giant mess. So right on the one end. I do want to you know, you judge the final work
[02:59.740 --> 03:07.740]  right that you should be able to ignore all of the backstory not even pay attention and then the movie comes out and
[03:08.420 --> 03:14.460]  I was gonna say you take your seat and let the film star but nobody does that anymore, right?
[03:14.460 --> 03:16.600]  We live we literally can't we hit play
[03:17.380 --> 03:20.820]  you watch the movie and then you can make an opinion but
[03:21.580 --> 03:22.820]  but
[03:22.820 --> 03:24.820]  There's some backstory
[03:25.220 --> 03:26.860]  stories that
[03:26.860 --> 03:34.140]  Are just petty politics and gossip and you know people get into digs in and then there's some where it's like
[03:34.140 --> 03:38.660]  Well, this sounds like it's impossible for a coherent movie to come out of it
[03:38.660 --> 03:41.940]  Yes, and then you watch it and it's like yep
[03:41.940 --> 03:48.100]  there is no way a coherent movie could come out of that and for example, I'm thinking of solo which was a
[03:49.060 --> 03:54.920]  Disaster behind the scenes and that's not even like gossip. That was just like just flat-out we have to Disney
[03:54.920 --> 03:58.840]  We have to say we fired these guys. We hired Ron Howard. We're
[03:59.660 --> 04:03.220]  Probably never should have made this movie in the first place. I think Disney said that
[04:03.940 --> 04:06.880]  Yeah, and the movie came out and it was it was horrendous
[04:07.660 --> 04:11.260]  It was I don't know if you saw it, but there's this movie came out on Disney plus it
[04:11.260 --> 04:14.320]  I believe it averted the cinema is called Arlo Finch. No
[04:15.260 --> 04:17.740]  So it's not Arlo Finch. I'm sorry. It's Artemis Fowl
[04:17.740 --> 04:23.940]  not not Arlo Finch and it was hugely controversial for not being a like the book the book is basically like
[04:23.940 --> 04:27.700]  Harry Potter but Harry Potter is a super villain and towards the end of it
[04:27.700 --> 04:31.860]  You start to see some redeeming qualities and that was the actual movie they made
[04:31.860 --> 04:34.100]  But then when they realized they were putting it on streaming
[04:34.100 --> 04:39.980]  They knew they couldn't just put it up like that because in a movie theater you pay your money up front and you're forced to
[04:39.980 --> 04:44.620]  Put up with the movie until the end and they figured that gave them time to redeem the character
[04:44.660 --> 04:50.420]  But on streaming if the kid was unlikable in the beginning people would just click off immediately
[04:50.420 --> 04:54.580]  So they redid the entire first half of the movie by overdubbing
[04:55.660 --> 04:59.300]  By overdubbing dialogue over scenes where you can't see anyone talking
[04:59.300 --> 05:06.380]  So through the entire first half of the movie you almost never see anyone say anything on screen. Yeah, that's that's an interesting story
[05:06.380 --> 05:10.960]  That is interesting that you kind of have to write streaming stuff in a different way, right? Yeah
[05:13.060 --> 05:15.580]  Anyway, we shouldn't be talking about any of this we have too much no
[05:16.420 --> 05:18.420]  Too much to go on
[05:18.420 --> 05:23.740]  So you are there's a bit of news breaking at least for me, I guess it's 24 hours old
[05:23.740 --> 05:31.300]  I don't know but the apples changing the name of beats one. Yeah, they're kind of finally getting away from the beat
[05:31.300 --> 05:37.940]  Is there anything left beats branded other than their beats headphones? No, I think that's it. It's just a few headphones left
[05:38.540 --> 05:46.580]  So what do we so the gist is that the until recently or until yesterday the big station on Apple music was beat one
[05:46.580 --> 05:50.820]  Yeah, and now they're renaming it Apple music one. Is that the new name?
[05:50.820 --> 05:51.420]  Yeah
[05:51.420 --> 05:56.260]  which is odd because when they meant when they said beats one originally a lot of us thought that meant there was going to be a
[05:56.260 --> 05:59.900]  Beats two and it beats three like BBC one BBC two fairly quickly
[05:59.900 --> 06:03.820]  But it's been four years and and this is a be only the beginning of it
[06:04.420 --> 06:08.180]  Yeah, but I wonder if that's why they're doing this now. I don't know. Maybe that's still
[06:09.740 --> 06:11.740]  When they bought beats
[06:11.740 --> 06:17.660]  2013 I want to say which is all of a sudden seems like a long time ago
[06:18.300 --> 06:20.220]  They had they got two things
[06:20.220 --> 06:27.780]  They got a big profitable headphone business and they got a streaming music service that they parlayed into
[06:28.860 --> 06:30.860]  What we now call Apple music. I
[06:31.700 --> 06:33.380]  always thought and
[06:33.380 --> 06:38.820]  still think that they bought it primarily for the streaming thing and in both in terms of a
[06:38.820 --> 06:42.460]  Sort of and I don't know how much of this was sort of a licensing coup
[06:42.980 --> 06:44.980]  where
[06:45.220 --> 06:51.020]  Like the record labels who grew suspicious of Apple because in
[06:52.140 --> 06:59.300]  2001 2002 when Apple launched the iTunes music store. I'm not gonna say they hoodwinked the music labels, but they
[07:00.580 --> 07:04.140]  You know, which sounds like they they they misdirected them
[07:04.140 --> 07:10.940]  but the the music labels underestimated Apple because Apple negotiated terms that would have allowed them to
[07:11.460 --> 07:17.060]  Sell these music the music everywhere and the music labels just wrongfully assumed
[07:17.060 --> 07:19.260]  Well, they've got this iPod thing
[07:19.260 --> 07:26.320]  But it only works on the Mac and the Mac is a niche market with like under 5% market share. So why not?
[07:26.940 --> 07:32.900]  Experiment with Apple at the most this will ever be 5% of the market if everybody on a Mac
[07:32.900 --> 07:37.700]  buys music through it, which probably won't happen, so it'll be less than 5% and
[07:38.500 --> 07:40.420]  instead, you know
[07:40.420 --> 07:42.940]  The iPod became a little bit more popular than that
[07:44.460 --> 07:51.700]  But anyway Apple's then, you know growing influence in the music industry led them to be grew viewed with suspicion
[07:52.380 --> 07:57.860]  Rightfully, so right like well, let's be careful negotiating with Apple. So I've always thought Apple
[07:57.860 --> 08:03.180]  could wanted to start their streaming music service by buying beats or
[08:03.540 --> 08:06.960]  Maybe somebody else so that they could get a leg in and say well
[08:07.260 --> 08:09.280]  Maybe you didn't want to negotiate with us
[08:09.280 --> 08:15.220]  But you negotiated with them and we can buy them and so now we've bought them and now we have these licensing deals that were
[08:15.220 --> 08:16.780]  already in place. I
[08:16.780 --> 08:19.700]  Don't know how much of that is true. I just assume it is
[08:20.260 --> 08:23.960]  To some degree. I've always heard that the licensing deals in many
[08:23.960 --> 08:30.180]  I don't know for the specific one, but in many cases are broken when they're sold or they at least have to be renegotiated
[08:30.180 --> 08:37.860]  I don't think they also just really like Jimmy Iovine in relationships and his vision for curated music because it was very anti
[08:38.700 --> 08:42.260]  Algorithm that seemed to really appeal to Apple at a deep level, right?
[08:42.260 --> 08:47.380]  and that's where I was going next was that even if those deals were severed or severable or
[08:47.900 --> 08:53.220]  Expired which at this point again if it's six seven years since it happened probably did
[08:53.220 --> 08:57.340]  that they wanted Jimmy Iovine on their side to
[08:57.940 --> 09:03.420]  Negotiate he had great relationships with them. And again his whole that whole sort of
[09:04.540 --> 09:07.540]  DJ slash producers ear towards
[09:09.580 --> 09:11.580]  You know
[09:11.620 --> 09:13.220]  Collecting the music whatever
[09:13.220 --> 09:13.780]  Yeah
[09:13.780 --> 09:20.340]  Just and talent right and it's interesting because they they've had beats one for a while now and they're launching beats hits
[09:20.340 --> 09:24.980]  might be said sorry Apple music hits and Apple music country and
[09:25.580 --> 09:30.420]  They seem to feel like they already have a lock on the hip-hop market or not a lot but a huge share
[09:31.140 --> 09:34.660]  Or a huge community around the hip-hop market
[09:34.660 --> 09:40.180]  But that's very modern hits or neck or what's tomorrow's hits driven and the hits channel is going to focus on
[09:40.580 --> 09:45.460]  music hits from the sixth and seventies eight sorry eighties nine eighties nineties and
[09:45.460 --> 09:52.180]  2000s and country is going to be based in Nashville and focusing on a very different music scene for them. Hmm
[09:52.780 --> 09:59.140]  Yeah, you know, I guess that's just the nature of the game. What do you think about what's the deals now with Beats headphones?
[09:59.140 --> 10:01.060]  Do you think that that just continues?
[10:01.060 --> 10:08.060]  Or do you think that this does this make does this raise your Spidey sense to make you think maybe the Beats brand is?
[10:08.620 --> 10:10.820]  No more or on the way out the door
[10:10.820 --> 10:16.900]  Yeah, I mean there were a couple rumors about that. I think John Prosser published something a while back saying that they were actively deprecating it
[10:16.900 --> 10:23.700]  But if just if you look at the evidence that we have they're replacing more and more of the Beats line with AirPods branded
[10:24.180 --> 10:29.500]  Devices and AirPods branded devices are far more popular than any of the Beats branded devices
[10:29.500 --> 10:35.020]  I think initially they liked the Beats brand because it had a very good demographic for them
[10:35.020 --> 10:39.180]  They were very there was popular culturally significant. They were selling a lot
[10:39.180 --> 10:45.060]  They were selling a lot but then AirPods came along and they're I don't know what else to say it, but they're meme worthy
[10:45.060 --> 10:50.460]  They've just become an entire subculture and that has greater value than I think them keeping the Beats
[10:51.020 --> 10:57.500]  Label around and if rumors of new over the ear and around the ear AirPods are true then it seems
[10:58.740 --> 11:00.740]  useless to keep Beats around
[11:01.340 --> 11:07.700]  Yeah, and there's always there's a part of me too that always thought and I think it's almost certainly true
[11:07.700 --> 11:08.940]  that
[11:08.940 --> 11:11.460]  to some degree the Beats brand
[11:12.140 --> 11:13.580]  was
[11:13.580 --> 11:18.740]  Inherently Apple like in that it was a very brand first
[11:19.740 --> 11:21.340]  polarizing
[11:21.340 --> 11:28.240]  Yeah thing and it was sold at a premium, you know that it was, you know, you know juicy profit margins
[11:29.780 --> 11:31.220]  Devoted fans
[11:31.220 --> 11:34.260]  You know that that people who got into Beats, you know
[11:34.260 --> 11:38.060]  We're if they lost their headphones or wanted a new pair they were gonna buy another pair of Beats
[11:38.060 --> 11:44.520]  You know, it's that they start by saying, you know, what Beach should I buy as opposed to which headphones should I buy?
[11:44.920 --> 11:47.280]  Which is you know Apple like fundamentally?
[11:47.940 --> 11:53.100]  But it's just weird for Apple to have a subsidiary like that, right? It's just not something they do
[11:53.100 --> 12:00.260]  They're not a conglomerate that owns a bunch of sub brands. There's like file maker in this right and even file maker
[12:00.260 --> 12:08.020]  You're you know a file maker as an independent company is truly ancient history by anyone's standards of this
[12:08.140 --> 12:11.460]  Industry, right? I mean you'd have to talk about other industries to
[12:12.140 --> 12:16.540]  Not qualify that as ancient history and even then there's a certain
[12:16.980 --> 12:20.860]  Very Apple enos to the file maker brand, right?
[12:20.860 --> 12:26.160]  They for a long time they even had a website that sort of just looked like the Apple website. Yeah
[12:26.160 --> 12:28.880]  It's you know
[12:28.880 --> 12:34.800]  And then again if you go around and just pull a thousand people and how many of them have heard of Beats headphones and how?
[12:34.800 --> 12:36.800]  Many of them have heard of file maker
[12:37.040 --> 12:39.040]  Yeah, you know in the general public
[12:39.040 --> 12:44.360]  You might get a very decided split if you talk to people who are listening to me and you right now on this show
[12:44.360 --> 12:46.360]  Yeah, sure. They've heard of file maker
[12:46.600 --> 12:51.040]  But even there I mean how many people do you know who are still using file maker on a regular basis?
[12:51.040 --> 12:53.720]  I'm not saying it's obscure, but it's just sort of you know
[12:53.720 --> 12:55.360]  a
[12:55.360 --> 12:58.720]  Legacy in a sense legacy, but still going strong
[12:59.360 --> 13:04.480]  You know anything with beats for me is that they've always done things that I think is beyond what Apple would do
[13:04.480 --> 13:11.440]  Like they have headphones in every Olympic team color. Yeah, Mickey Mouse branded headphones, which are deals. I don't see Apple making with AirPods
[13:11.440 --> 13:17.800]  Yeah, totally and it gets them it also I think gets them a certain segment of the market who you know
[13:18.040 --> 13:21.440]  Let's just face it like on a mobile sense probably has an Android phone
[13:21.440 --> 13:29.080]  I wouldn't buy wouldn't buy an an Apple pair of headphones, even if it worked it was advertised as working with Android
[13:30.000 --> 13:36.080]  And would buy beats and so it is, you know, it's a but but on the whole
[13:36.080 --> 13:41.320]  I just don't see it as going away and I kind of think the vague, you know, not that there's a specific
[13:42.520 --> 13:47.520]  whiteboard somewhere at Apple where here's the plan to get rid of beats but as a
[13:47.520 --> 13:54.360]  sort of loosely held notion the cooler the AirPods brand gets and the
[13:54.720 --> 13:58.560]  More products that fall within the AirPods brand
[13:58.560 --> 14:05.300]  I mean, we're up to two but supposedly at least a third, you know, the big new one the over the ears type thing
[14:06.520 --> 14:10.760]  You know has been rumored for a long time and you know the sports ones, right?
[14:10.760 --> 14:14.720]  So two two holes in the market for AirPods, so we've got regular ones
[14:14.720 --> 14:21.840]  You've got the AirPods Pro which are noise cancelling, but the same basic idea as regular AirPods
[14:22.480 --> 14:26.200]  so the two holes would be the over the ear type and the
[14:27.040 --> 14:31.680]  Sports ones. Yeah, right and you know somewhere Marco's listening to this and me
[14:32.240 --> 14:36.040]  Qualifying the entire concept of over the ears headphones is one category
[14:38.720 --> 14:43.200]  It's for me is just saying like AirPods X because I try to say this with the processors
[14:43.200 --> 14:48.640]  I was trying to say a 12x yesterday and I kept saying a 12 10 and apples destroyed any ability for me to distinguish what?
[14:48.640 --> 14:50.640]  That symbol means
[14:53.240 --> 14:55.120]  It's very true
[14:55.120 --> 14:59.320]  Lea at least Microsoft's very consistent. They use a lot of X's but they're always access
[14:59.320 --> 15:04.940]  Although I guess what did know Windows 10 is it is a one zero. Yep. Yeah, blessed one zero
[15:04.940 --> 15:14.140]  Uh, yeah, so I think that it beats probably aren't going away but they're fading away. Yes, sir, I think
[15:16.020 --> 15:20.080]  All right, let me take a break before we dig into the meat of the show and thank our first sponsor
[15:20.080 --> 15:22.340]  It's our good friends our old friends at Squarespace
[15:23.140 --> 15:24.540]  Hey
[15:24.540 --> 15:29.740]  I'm Ted. I keep saying that over and over again and it's like this whole year for better for worse
[15:29.740 --> 15:34.380]  Not even getting to the worst but just the basic notion of it. It's it's Groundhog Day year, right?
[15:34.380 --> 15:40.420]  It effectively if there's ever been a year where you can make New Year's resolutions in August this 2020 is it?
[15:40.660 --> 15:42.780]  We all have a lot more time on our hands
[15:42.780 --> 15:47.180]  I'm telling you if you one of the things on your list your list of like hey stuff I should do
[15:47.260 --> 15:53.940]  while I'm mostly at home still stuck in quarantine if one of them is to make a new website or update an old website or
[15:54.620 --> 15:57.500]  Help somebody else get their self started with a website
[15:57.860 --> 16:02.700]  Take a look at Squarespace first Squarespace all in one everything from domain name
[16:02.700 --> 16:07.740]  registration to picking a template to modifying the template to picking which sort of
[16:08.060 --> 16:12.020]  Components you want on a website. Like is it a blog? Is it gonna host a podcast?
[16:12.020 --> 16:16.700]  Is it a storefront where you want to have a catalog of items and sell stuff?
[16:17.500 --> 16:20.500]  You could do all that stuff on Squarespace. You could do it all on one website
[16:20.700 --> 16:27.460]  You could do it just one of them. You could host a menu just about every restaurant every small mom-and-pop restaurant
[16:27.460 --> 16:30.220]  I know you go view source. Look at the source of the web page
[16:30.220 --> 16:38.020]  Guess where it's hosted Squarespace because it lets you worry about your stuff without worrying about all the stuff that you don't need to worry
[16:38.020 --> 16:40.020]  About because you're not a web professional
[16:40.180 --> 16:43.900]  Software updates server stuff like that. You don't have to worry about it
[16:44.060 --> 16:47.940]  But all the stuff you do want like control over the website what it looks like
[16:48.680 --> 16:53.980]  The analytics seeing who's using the website where they're coming from where the traffic is coming from
[16:54.020 --> 16:56.780]  They have a great great analytics dashboard
[16:56.780 --> 17:02.460]  So next time you need a website or someone, you know comes to you because you're a nerd and they want you to help
[17:03.260 --> 17:07.420]  Get them a website send them to Squarespace. I'm telling you. You won't regret it
[17:07.420 --> 17:12.100]  You get a free trial 30 days after that if you use the code talk show

[17:18.300 --> 17:19.500]  talk show
[17:19.500 --> 17:27.180]  Squarespace.com slash talk show and that same code talk show when you sign up gets you 10% off your first purchase. I
[17:29.420 --> 17:32.380]  Thought I would have thought that Phil Schiller
[17:33.380 --> 17:35.420]  stepping aside stepping up
[17:36.620 --> 17:42.220]  Advancing in Apple's verbiage to an Apple fellow. That would be a whole show. Yeah
[17:44.100 --> 17:47.580]  Something we got to get out of the way we got to get out of the way quickly
[17:47.580 --> 17:48.860]  He's
[17:48.860 --> 17:50.380]  he's
[17:50.380 --> 17:56.460]  Still he's long time. I don't even know they don't even say how long he's been the senior vice president of worldwide marketing
[17:56.460 --> 17:59.580]  That's his title. Now used to be worldwide product marketing. I
[18:00.380 --> 18:06.460]  Don't know when they lost the product, but it's the same job. I think when Jaws became VP of product marketing. Hmm, maybe
[18:07.100 --> 18:11.860]  I'm not quite sure what that means. But like a lot of companies that probably mean something inside Apple
[18:12.580 --> 18:14.180]  Yeah
[18:14.180 --> 18:16.180]  product
[18:16.180 --> 18:22.860]  Uh, what does it mean? Is he one foot out the door? Is this just the graceful easy way of
[18:23.460 --> 18:31.460]  Phil Schiller heading into retirement or is he really going to be around for years to come with the App Store and
[18:32.500 --> 18:34.500]  Events still on his plate
[18:35.300 --> 18:37.300]  We don't know. I don't know
[18:38.060 --> 18:40.060]  Phil Schiller probably does know
[18:40.380 --> 18:44.480]  But they're not gonna mean Mansfield try to get out and they brought him back in so I don't really know
[18:44.480 --> 18:46.040]  I
[18:46.040 --> 18:53.120]  Thought that like I don't I think that in certain terms of being well known
[18:53.960 --> 18:56.640]  By people who follow the company
[18:58.600 --> 19:01.080]  Schiller's up there at the top of the list
[19:01.880 --> 19:08.760]  You know not probably not quite certainly nobody's up there with Steve Jobs. Nobody anymore is up there with Tim Cook
[19:08.760 --> 19:14.400]  He's the CEO. He is the face of the company a brightly. So Johnny I've unique. I
[19:14.920 --> 19:21.960]  You know Schiller is next on that list. I think without question. I would say fourth, you know fourth on the list. I
[19:22.880 --> 19:27.340]  Think when you have fun intros for years, that's the most popular visible positions to do
[19:28.200 --> 19:35.240]  Every time whether there were a couple of years were early on, you know, where Steve Jobs was out on medical leave
[19:35.240 --> 19:39.640]  I believe the 3gs
[19:40.320 --> 19:43.960]  Yes. Yes the 3gs. So the third iPhone
[19:44.760 --> 19:46.760]  Which was still introduced at?
[19:47.880 --> 19:49.880]  WWDC yeah
[19:50.640 --> 19:55.160]  Schiller took the took the job. So there was a while where every single iPhone
[19:55.680 --> 20:03.400]  In fact, maybe still to some degree that's true that every single iPhone has either been introduced on stage by Steve Jobs or Phil Schiller
[20:03.400 --> 20:04.640]  I
[20:04.640 --> 20:07.280]  Tied to the 11 last year, right?
[20:07.280 --> 20:13.160]  I think that's the first variant cayenne grants the right president not new vice president of iPhone marketing, right?
[20:13.160 --> 20:17.160]  Oh, so she's got the she took John jaws his old title. Is that true?
[20:17.160 --> 20:21.760]  I didn't know though jaws was VP of product marketing and he had a bunch of VPS under him
[20:21.760 --> 20:27.800]  Like Stan was vice president of Apple watch marketing cayenne's vice president of iPhone marketing, right?
[20:27.800 --> 20:34.560]  I think they just have their own divisions now. Yeah, I guess that this sort of
[20:35.440 --> 20:41.260]  Basic idea of who introduced the new iPhone each year is sort of stale anyway
[20:41.260 --> 20:45.860]  Because yeah, the product line has expanded, you know, and what is the main iPhone?
[20:45.860 --> 20:49.360]  Is it the iPhone 11 or is it the iPhone 11 Pro right?
[20:49.360 --> 20:54.200]  the pro is obviously the one that's the hero in the lineup, but the iPhone 11 is the one that's the
[20:54.200 --> 20:58.120]  Actually the better product for most people and the best-selling one
[20:58.640 --> 20:59.440]  Yeah, absolutely
[20:59.440 --> 21:06.400]  And I think you know, I think just Schiller loved the cameras so much too and the 11 Pro was all mostly about the cameras
[21:06.400 --> 21:11.520]  Yeah, yeah, because it was the first one to have three. Is that right? Yeah
[21:12.160 --> 21:14.160]  Yeah, and the sweater mode
[21:14.960 --> 21:16.960]  That's right sweater mode
[21:18.840 --> 21:23.400]  Yeah, I don't want to because you know and it's weird it's you know, I don't know what you call it
[21:23.400 --> 21:26.120]  We have a word when somebody dies call it a eulogy
[21:26.680 --> 21:28.120]  I
[21:28.120 --> 21:31.280]  Don't know what you call it when somebody retires, you know, but it's weird
[21:31.280 --> 21:38.120]  I don't feel I honestly don't feel like it's time to talk about Phil Schiller in the past tense. I really don't especially
[21:39.040 --> 21:42.720]  With and you know, I don't know. I don't know if you looked at the show notes
[21:42.720 --> 21:48.480]  I have here for the rest of this. Yeah podcast the App Store is going we are going to mention it once or twice
[21:49.280 --> 21:52.120]  Yeah, it's not exactly like his
[21:52.120 --> 21:54.120]  limited
[21:54.200 --> 21:59.960]  Plate of our limited selection of things still on his plate are obscure
[22:00.920 --> 22:04.680]  You know, the thing is that the senior vice presidents at Apple are all overloaded
[22:04.680 --> 22:07.880]  They would all be presidents if not CEOs of their own companies
[22:07.880 --> 22:14.440]  Those divisions are huge and if you look at Eddie's desk or Phil's desk previously the the sheer quantity of things
[22:14.440 --> 22:16.680]  They had to deal with was ridiculous
[22:16.680 --> 22:21.480]  Which is why I think they were aggressive in getting a whole new range of vice presidents under them
[22:21.480 --> 22:27.240]  but even jaws taking this job, you know, the the senior vice president of worldwide marketing and
[22:27.440 --> 22:33.480]  not having to deal with the App Store and with events in 2020, I think is just a
[22:34.120 --> 22:36.280]  If I was you know, it would be a huge. Thank you
[22:36.280 --> 22:41.320]  You know, there's gonna be a lot going on right now you keeping those two things just much appreciated, right?
[22:41.320 --> 22:47.800]  So the two things that are still on Phil Schiller's plate as an Apple fellow are the App Store and Apple events
[22:47.800 --> 22:50.840]  Which are in order the most controversial
[22:51.400 --> 22:57.640]  Aspect of Apple's business. I think I think it's fair to say that it's obviously up for argument and the highest-profile
[22:58.200 --> 23:04.360]  Aspect which I think is inarguable right the Apple introduction events, especially the fall one for new iPhones
[23:04.360 --> 23:06.600]  But WWDC is a close second
[23:07.720 --> 23:13.320]  And you know any other special events they deem necessary throughout the year are obviously the highest proof
[23:13.320 --> 23:15.720]  They're literally that's the whole point of them is to be high-profile
[23:15.720 --> 23:21.400]  Right, I mean it's and that's only the events we see but that organization also is huge and does a ton of other things from
[23:21.400 --> 23:23.240]  developer kitchens to
[23:23.240 --> 23:27.800]  Like mainstream media things to now with Apple TV plus Hollywood sort of things
[23:28.680 --> 23:35.000]  Right. Well and speaking of Hollywood sort of things. I had Adam Lisa Gore on the show a couple of weeks ago
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  We talked about the keynote
[23:38.040 --> 23:41.320]  And I think I get my dates mixed up
[23:41.320 --> 23:42.760]  I don't know about you in 2020
[23:42.760 --> 23:54.200]  But I think the Samsung event came after that and the longer we go from WWDC and the more we settle in to the
[23:55.080 --> 23:58.200]  At least temporary, you know, it is temporary at some point
[23:58.200 --> 24:03.480]  We'll get back to having public events without I mean, you know for the long way or the short way eventually
[24:04.040 --> 24:06.040]  Covid-19 is going to dissipate
[24:06.040 --> 24:11.000]  But in the meantime the longer we go from WWDC the better it looks I mean
[24:11.000 --> 24:14.680]  I don't think anybody really complained about it when it happened. It was like wow
[24:14.680 --> 24:18.360]  This is you know, maybe there were things we were surprised they did it this way or that way
[24:18.360 --> 24:25.240]  But now watching as more time has gone on and more companies have done things that are have to be remote that were previously in person
[24:25.960 --> 24:31.960]  Boy, it really it stands apart. I mean so Facebook and Google just canceled theirs
[24:31.960 --> 24:36.120]  They just said we're not even doing it. We're we're just not there
[24:36.120 --> 24:40.520]  So there is no that the and I feel like it's fair to say, you know that that's it
[24:41.320 --> 24:47.400]  You can't say they did a bad job with their developer conferences, but it's a way of judging how important they are to the companies
[24:48.120 --> 24:55.560]  Yeah, like yeah, I don't think it was ever even on the table for Apple not to have WWDC in some way online
[24:56.200 --> 24:58.200]  like yeah and
[24:58.200 --> 25:04.920]  It is high their new releases so closely to the event which Google doesn't always do like the new version of Android is just announced at
[25:04.920 --> 25:09.240]  Some point and they do three betas and then it's live and over the next eight years people adopt it
[25:10.280 --> 25:18.040]  Right and Facebook, you know, I'm not saying that you know, their developer conference has developers and there are things that
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.920]  Facebook offers that are API's and integrations that
[25:22.920 --> 25:28.440]  Developers follow and they have even a hardware platform that's relevant with oculus
[25:30.200 --> 25:33.080]  But it's just not central to what they do
[25:33.080 --> 25:36.760]  You know and again this will tie in to the remainder of this episode
[25:36.760 --> 25:43.640]  But the App Store and the message from Apple to third-party developers and the way that they convey those same
[25:44.920 --> 25:47.320]  tentpole features of their platforms to
[25:47.320 --> 25:52.920]  users too, um is really uh, it's just a
[25:54.040 --> 25:58.440]  It's a tentpole aspect of Apple's annual calendar that just cannot be
[25:59.640 --> 26:01.640]  overstated
[26:02.200 --> 26:06.360]  Uh, Samsung's event with the iPhone event. I saw mixed reviews of Samsung's event
[26:06.360 --> 26:11.240]  I couldn't watch the whole thing, but I saw some clips. I thought it was I mean it wasn't unprofessional
[26:11.240 --> 26:13.240]  But I thought it was really bad
[26:13.240 --> 26:18.360]  I thought there were aspects of it that were just I I like I can't believe that this is real
[26:19.320 --> 26:24.680]  No, I the thing is and a lot of people say oh it's because it's 2020 or it's because you know
[26:24.680 --> 26:31.560]  It's it's Samsung, but I was at a Samsung event at Radio City Music Hall years ago and it was a disaster
[26:31.560 --> 26:35.400]  And I knew some of the people who were working at Samsung at the time and they said basically
[26:35.640 --> 26:38.680]  They got the script on the teleprompter was the first time they ever saw it
[26:38.680 --> 26:44.200]  And they tried their best to say it out loud and that's apparently what happened again this time and just it
[26:44.200 --> 26:50.680]  Must be five or six years later. You can make that mistake once after that. It's just not caring right and you know
[26:50.680 --> 26:59.240]  There were there were two main co-hosts sort of like news anchors at a desk there there was an Asian woman on the left and
[26:59.880 --> 27:02.760]  a young black man on the right and
[27:02.760 --> 27:10.760]  You know lots of points for diversity with you know, a woman and a man and an Asian and a black
[27:11.640 --> 27:15.640]  Man, but they clearly weren't Samsung
[27:16.600 --> 27:20.440]  Executives, you know, they weren't people with knowledge of the products
[27:20.440 --> 27:26.680]  I mean and some of what they were reading where I mean they were clearly just reading and it was very, you know
[27:26.680 --> 27:29.000]  It was very hard for them to be able to do that
[27:29.000 --> 27:35.000]  I mean, they were clearly just reading and it was very, you know, it really seemed like was it was this take one?
[27:35.160 --> 27:36.920]  I mean what is going on here?
[27:36.920 --> 27:40.840]  I believe it was I believe that's the first time I saw that stuff because the script keeps getting and they're also
[27:41.480 --> 27:47.080]  Samsung America fights with Samsung Korea over who's going to be in charge of things who's going to do things
[27:47.400 --> 27:51.000]  And you can't run a company that way. It's not a unified vision for an event
[27:51.400 --> 27:55.480]  right and that it it highlights to me and I you know that
[27:55.480 --> 27:57.480]  Apple's
[27:57.480 --> 28:02.040]  WWDC was certainly more diverse and who got screen time then you know in there and their
[28:02.280 --> 28:05.640]  Presentations are getting more diverse and they're getting more people
[28:06.280 --> 28:12.840]  Into the events and they use the unique sort of pre-taped version of this. I think in a very
[28:13.480 --> 28:17.080]  Good way to get more people involved without making it seem
[28:17.720 --> 28:21.880]  Like at a lot of other companies if you know to look for it
[28:21.880 --> 28:28.380]  If you know to look for it, you can see it that it's a political argument between companies that are organized divisionally
[28:29.000 --> 28:36.360]  Where each division is arguing for time in the keynote whether they deserve whether that works for the company's benefit or not
[28:37.160 --> 28:42.840]  You know and it's time for somebody from the xbox division to come up and speak even though there's nothing new for the xbox
[28:42.920 --> 28:47.080]  This year to do it, but they don't want to give up their 20-minute spot in the keynote
[28:47.080 --> 28:53.000]  and and sometimes that's very transparent and the lack of a divisional nature within apple sort of
[28:53.560 --> 28:55.560]  Has always helped them avoid that
[28:56.120 --> 29:03.580]  But the thing about apple and the people you see in their events is that it's always people who are responsible
[29:04.920 --> 29:10.600]  Yes directly for the thing that they are telling you about, you know, and if it's somebody telling you
[29:11.320 --> 29:13.320]  about the new
[29:13.320 --> 29:19.660]  New wireless technology that helps the two air pods talk to each other with no latency
[29:19.820 --> 29:26.780]  It's somebody who's directly involved in the development of the air pods product. It's not just let's pick somebody to talk about it
[29:26.860 --> 29:30.620]  It's somebody let's pick somebody who is involved with it to talk about it
[29:31.260 --> 29:34.940]  If if the power went out and you were stuck in an elevator with them and they had no
[29:35.340 --> 29:39.980]  Like no preparation time they could still give you an incredible education about that product, right?
[29:39.980 --> 29:48.220]  Right, that is it's very true, right and you know that they're they're obviously involved in picking out these sort of bullet points
[29:48.220 --> 29:50.700]  What's the best way to make somebody understand this product?
[29:52.300 --> 29:58.380]  So I really do think that you know having seen a couple of other things and i'll throw in the democratic national convention
[29:58.380 --> 30:00.460]  That's going on this week as we record
[30:01.100 --> 30:02.460]  Which isn't bad, you know
[30:02.460 --> 30:08.780]  But it is it's another thing like a product introduction keynote that is traditionally held on a stage
[30:08.780 --> 30:11.580]  in front of thousands of people and
[30:13.100 --> 30:16.060]  Interspersed with occasional pre-taped things
[30:16.540 --> 30:22.140]  Whereas now it has to be entirely remote with no crowd, which is very unusual
[30:22.860 --> 30:23.660]  um
[30:23.660 --> 30:29.900]  And they're doing a you know, it's to me a credible job, you know, basically you're not putting on a live show anymore
[30:29.900 --> 30:31.900]  You're putting you're making a tv show
[30:32.060 --> 30:36.140]  Yeah, they're doing okay, but it's not they're not doing great. I think what apple did with
[30:36.140 --> 30:38.360]  wwdc like
[30:38.360 --> 30:44.720]  Wwdc is the only thing that's happened so far in 2020 that used to be live wasn't live at all
[30:44.960 --> 30:51.040]  And afterwards had a lot of people saying oh, this is probably what they're going to do forever even when covid is over
[30:51.360 --> 30:56.160]  That's the only one so far. Nobody is looking at this democratic national committee
[30:56.640 --> 30:59.920]  Convention and saying oh four years from now, they'll do it the same way. No
[31:00.880 --> 31:03.680]  Exactly that and like and samsung had terrific products
[31:03.680 --> 31:08.640]  Like they like you you can either like them or not like them think they're boring or or iterative or they're fantastic
[31:08.720 --> 31:12.800]  But their products were all super solid and it was just the event that let them down
[31:13.280 --> 31:18.320]  Where apple didn't have any like no products that required atoms like at least like from the developer kit
[31:18.560 --> 31:22.640]  it was all software, but their production value and storytelling was just
[31:24.240 --> 31:29.840]  Expertly done. Yeah, and it you know things that were awkward or just I don't remember anything, you know
[31:29.840 --> 31:35.040]  It was all very smooth and rehearsed and well tight and tightened up like I with the samsung
[31:35.760 --> 31:40.000]  Co-hosts, I I I think it was very clear that they weren't together
[31:40.720 --> 31:45.280]  You know and it would hopefully they weren't because I think it would you know, they were too close, you know
[31:45.280 --> 31:47.680]  So they simulated them being close together
[31:47.920 --> 31:53.680]  But there were times where their banter back and forth was just so poorly edited where it's like I really hope
[31:53.680 --> 31:59.620]  That this is just poorly edited back and forth banter because if they really were together, this is excruciating
[32:01.280 --> 32:02.240]  It was well
[32:02.240 --> 32:07.520]  Usually like there's a couple things that I always dunk on samsung for every year and one is they they're very different than apple
[32:07.520 --> 32:09.120]  But not in always a good way
[32:09.120 --> 32:13.700]  They always do pre briefings which means like if it was me and you we would go to samsung
[32:14.240 --> 32:20.340]  A week or two weeks before we'd get time in a room. We'd get to ask them questions take photos film the devices
[32:20.340 --> 32:23.540]  Maybe you know get review units then two weeks before the event
[32:23.780 --> 32:27.780]  Then when the event starts the exact moment the event starts the embargo lifts
[32:27.780 --> 32:32.420]  So like marquez and everybody's videos go live and now I no longer know if I should be watching the event
[32:32.740 --> 32:35.780]  Or watching the videos which are going to be way more concise than the event
[32:36.340 --> 32:41.300]  Where typically they spend like they have a 20-minute speech about how they're the most innovative company in the world
[32:41.540 --> 32:45.620]  And if tim cook did that I would change the channel. I don't want to hear that from any ceo when i'm a captive audience
[32:45.620 --> 32:51.860]  Yeah, and they had like a two-person interview this time which which wasted my time in exactly the same way. I I just don't I
[32:52.500 --> 32:59.140]  Just show me the products and tell me why I should buy them. Yeah, I don't and why not just put the embargo a day afterwards
[32:59.780 --> 33:05.480]  It's very strange. Yeah. Yeah, we're after the show anything that makes it just more literally possible like a sequential
[33:05.780 --> 33:07.780]  Yeah, just you know, even just after the show
[33:08.820 --> 33:12.580]  So anyway, do you think that we've seen the last of phil schiller on stage?
[33:12.580 --> 33:18.660]  I hope not just because I I it's one of the things where you just want to see it's like when batman comes out one last
[33:18.660 --> 33:23.300]  Time it just gives you that rush and if he was had the opportunity to do something that he loved
[33:23.620 --> 33:29.460]  Like talk about new photographic technology or new audio technology or a big change to the app store
[33:29.460 --> 33:33.460]  Which i'm sure we'll get into soon and he could do that on stage. I think it would be terrific
[33:34.340 --> 33:37.060]  Seeing him knowing that would be one of the last times instead of
[33:37.700 --> 33:41.220]  You know sort of enjoying the past ones not knowing that that way there would be a change
[33:41.220 --> 33:45.300]  Yeah, and I I don't know I I I could see it, you know, and he's certainly
[33:46.260 --> 33:50.740]  I think it was obvious as it happened that there was a um
[33:51.940 --> 33:55.460]  And it's a broader argument. We don't have time to get into but
[33:56.100 --> 33:58.740]  apple's events have evolved
[33:59.380 --> 34:03.700]  Over time and and when you go back and watch the steve jobs era ones
[34:04.420 --> 34:08.260]  It it's a lot easier to notice by jumping back
[34:08.260 --> 34:12.360]  11-12 years than it was to notice incrementally
[34:13.060 --> 34:19.300]  Year after year event after event, but they've gotten a lot more polished. They've gotten a lot more hollywood
[34:20.900 --> 34:24.740]  For better or for worse, uh, you know, and I think you can make both cases
[34:28.980 --> 34:35.700]  But one of the other differences is that there's a lot more people who get stage time now
[34:35.700 --> 34:40.500]  like there were times in the past where it really, you know, especially in the jobs era where it was
[34:42.100 --> 34:46.500]  The only people who might come on stage were people from outside apple right, you know
[34:46.500 --> 34:50.580]  it's like when the iphone got introduced and it's like well, let's bring eric schmidt from google and
[34:51.060 --> 34:55.620]  jerry yang from yahoo to talk about the weather app that we're using yahoo weather for
[34:56.340 --> 34:58.660]  Uh, oh and who can forget, uh, stan
[35:00.100 --> 35:01.780]  That was his last name
[35:01.780 --> 35:08.100]  That the guy from singular. Oh god, i'm blanking on it. Oh, yeah, that was those were always terrible
[35:08.100 --> 35:11.700]  Stan the man with the worst the worst on stage
[35:15.300 --> 35:17.300]  Presence in an apple keynote ever
[35:19.540 --> 35:20.500]  But
[35:20.500 --> 35:26.500]  It you know, there's a lot more people from within the company who are involved now in recent years
[35:26.500 --> 35:32.820]  And this is a pet peeve of mine had been but I love it now to me. This is one of the things that to me is
[35:33.540 --> 35:38.660]  A change that i've noticed but most people don't seem to comment on but I think it's only for the better
[35:38.660 --> 35:40.660]  It's not just that you see more people
[35:41.540 --> 35:43.540]  throughout apple on
[35:43.860 --> 35:48.420]  On stage or on screen as the case may be but they get credit by name
[35:49.300 --> 35:54.180]  You know, here's uh, cayenne drance. Here's you know, and and just down the line
[35:54.180 --> 35:59.380]  And and the wwdc coach keynote credited every single person who appeared by name
[36:00.100 --> 36:04.020]  And you know just re you know with the title that told you that they work on whatever it is
[36:04.020 --> 36:08.020]  there you didn't really have to see their title because whatever they're talking about is what they work on but
[36:09.060 --> 36:11.300]  I think that's a big change and I think you could you know
[36:11.300 --> 36:16.580]  There's a certain strategy to that to become less reliant on phil shiller individually
[36:17.460 --> 36:22.660]  And you know craig federighi and you know, it's not just tim craig and phil shiller
[36:22.660 --> 36:25.780]  Tim craig and phil doing everything every time
[36:26.820 --> 36:30.580]  And the occasional eddie like the occasional eddie cube, you know bright shirt
[36:33.060 --> 36:40.100]  Well, it's so different because you would if you I watched the old events quite a lot and when they were at town hall at infinite loop
[36:40.660 --> 36:44.980]  Steve would just say and phil's going to tell you about it or even johnny's going to tell you about the new unibody
[36:45.220 --> 36:49.060]  And you'd literally see them step up from the chair. Yeah jump up on stage and turn around
[36:49.060 --> 36:51.540]  I don't know. That's very true
[36:55.140 --> 36:56.580]  Um
[36:56.580 --> 37:01.700]  Yeah, I don't know I if I had to bet I would say we'll still see shiller, uh again, um
[37:02.500 --> 37:05.700]  You know possibly in the exact same role. I mean it has been
[37:06.500 --> 37:10.020]  Uh, and people just don't notice but like I even mentioned, you know
[37:10.020 --> 37:15.860]  and it makes me a little annoyed because they're obviously not paying close attention to my wwdc talk shows, but um,
[37:15.860 --> 37:21.480]  Um, it started a few years ago when phil shiller didn't appear on stage at wwdc
[37:22.340 --> 37:27.460]  And yeah, and I and but he was on my show afterwards and I brought it up and I remember which
[37:27.940 --> 37:32.260]  I think we were still at 111 mina in san francisco. In fact, I know we were um
[37:33.380 --> 37:37.860]  We're not 111 minute the uh, wherever the other place was in san francisco. Um
[37:38.500 --> 37:42.500]  But we were still in san francisco and I asked phil about hey
[37:42.500 --> 37:46.900]  This is the first time I think in a long time. You haven't been to wwdc and he was like, yeah, it's like 20 years
[37:48.100 --> 37:50.100]  Like he'd been on stage every time
[37:50.100 --> 37:55.140]  um, and I you know, I I think it was strategic to broaden it out, you know, and and
[37:56.180 --> 38:01.220]  It it does also follow with the whoever is saying it is responsible for it
[38:01.780 --> 38:04.500]  And craig federigi in charge of software
[38:04.500 --> 38:12.260]  is the number two after tim cook at wwdc where they're talking about their software platforms and
[38:12.820 --> 38:18.660]  It's hardware people like phil and cayenne talking about the iphones when?
[38:19.140 --> 38:21.780]  It's september middle september and the iphones come out
[38:22.980 --> 38:30.260]  I think phil the last I remember him at wwc was the home pod in 2017. He just had so many hardware products at that show
[38:30.260 --> 38:35.220]  At that show and he capped it off. I think with the home pod. Yeah, I remember that that was a tough demo because
[38:35.380 --> 38:38.260]  I remember he even acknowledged that it was a tough demo because it's like
[38:38.820 --> 38:43.620]  we've done all this advanced stuff to make it sound good in the living room and now we have to simulate it for you and
[38:44.340 --> 38:46.420]  Yeah in a room full of six thousand people
[38:46.980 --> 38:51.380]  But he was really deep on that product like he was there for everything and he and you could tell he loved it
[38:51.460 --> 38:54.580]  And I think that's why he was the one who did it at dub dub
[38:54.580 --> 38:59.060]  Uh, so anyway, let me take a break before we dive into the app store
[38:59.060 --> 39:02.740]  If we have a little bit to talk about and let me tell you about our next sponsor. It's feels
[39:03.460 --> 39:06.660]  Hey, do you experience stress? Do you have anxiety? Maybe chronic pain?
[39:06.660 --> 39:10.660]  Do you have trouble sleeping at least once a week? You are not alone. Many people do
[39:11.220 --> 39:13.220]  feels is premium

[39:15.380 --> 39:17.720]  delivered directly to your doorstep
[39:18.260 --> 39:23.480]  What does feels do feels naturally helps reduce stress anxiety pain and sleeplessness?

[39:48.840 --> 39:50.920]  You want to just text which is what I would do
[39:50.920 --> 39:55.880]  Uh, you could do that too, but you get a real person on the other end not just some automated support thing
[39:56.360 --> 39:57.560]  uh
[39:57.560 --> 40:01.880]  And they can help guide your personal experience to tell you what you know, what what should you order?
[40:01.880 --> 40:03.880]  What should you expect that sort of thing?

[40:49.720 --> 40:50.680]  Uh
[40:50.680 --> 40:52.680]  The app store. Oh, yeah
[40:53.400 --> 40:56.680]  Oh boy, it's a lot. John. Hey, you know what before we go on to app store?
[40:56.680 --> 40:59.480]  We should just say I I think that in addition to
[41:00.120 --> 41:06.280]  I because he's been on stage so much the phil shiller moving on from being in charge of product marketing to
[41:06.280 --> 41:09.480]  Its title of apple fellow with a limited number of things on his plate
[41:10.440 --> 41:12.440]  Gets got all the a lot of publicity
[41:13.080 --> 41:15.480]  jaws getting promoted to
[41:16.440 --> 41:18.680]  senior vice president of worldwide marketing
[41:19.400 --> 41:20.760]  is
[41:20.760 --> 41:25.320]  It was very obvious to anybody who's known anything about the company for 10 15
[41:25.480 --> 41:29.560]  Maybe longer years that jaws was number two under under phil
[41:31.320 --> 41:36.040]  And you know i'm not just saying this in the self-serving way that jaws has been on my show a couple of years ago
[41:36.040 --> 41:38.040]  a couple of times, um
[41:38.200 --> 41:40.200]  but he is
[41:41.320 --> 41:42.920]  Really
[41:42.920 --> 41:44.920]  it just
[41:45.160 --> 41:49.320]  The amount of time he's been on stage is not proportionate to his influence within
[41:49.880 --> 41:51.880]  that marketing division
[41:52.120 --> 41:57.240]  You know, he's just you know, humbly allowed himself to be mostly off stage over the years
[41:58.920 --> 42:01.400]  But he's good when he's on stage he's amazing
[42:02.360 --> 42:04.360]  He did the 10.2 inch. Um
[42:04.360 --> 42:06.600]  ipad at the last september event
[42:06.840 --> 42:11.960]  Yeah, and he's also one of the smart like in my old career when I worked in product marketing
[42:12.200 --> 42:16.600]  I was in enterprise but most of the marketing people that you dealt with were sales people
[42:16.840 --> 42:18.760]  And all they would do is try to sell you on a product
[42:18.760 --> 42:22.360]  They would tell you it had any feature and if it didn't have it that you know that the sky was limit
[42:22.360 --> 42:27.960]  They just wanted to make sales and apple's marketing is not like that at all. He's an engineer
[42:28.040 --> 42:31.020]  He can explain battery chemistry processor architecture
[42:31.020 --> 42:35.280]  Everything like three layers deep and they really have an ownership of products
[42:35.280 --> 42:39.120]  That's almost unheard of in general marketing organizations, right?
[42:39.280 --> 42:45.280]  And and i've said this before often maybe specifically about phil shiller
[42:46.300 --> 42:53.360]  Individually, but really is more about the entire division that people's the layperson's
[42:55.340 --> 42:58.560]  Conception of what quote-unquote marketing means is
[42:58.560 --> 43:03.840]  Absolutely, not what marketing means at apple. Like if you think marketing means
[43:04.640 --> 43:08.180]  The you design the packaging and the advertising
[43:08.800 --> 43:12.240]  For products, you know that other people ready jingles, right?
[43:12.240 --> 43:17.760]  You you know that you know that you're like the in-house ad agency for the products that you know
[43:17.760 --> 43:19.680]  They come to you and say here and now sell this
[43:20.320 --> 43:24.640]  That is how marketing works at some companies. It may be how marketing works at a lot of companies
[43:24.640 --> 43:30.800]  It is nothing how marketing works at apple marketing. I always said they got rid of the word product, but I always said
[43:31.440 --> 43:36.320]  That when his title was direct or senior vice president of worldwide product marketing
[43:36.400 --> 43:41.360]  The product was more important than the marketing. Yes, um, and they're involved from the conception forward
[43:41.920 --> 43:46.800]  Like you said jaws knows his stuff inside and out battery chemistry stuff like that
[43:46.800 --> 43:53.540]  Cayenne drance, you know her knowledge of the camera systems is so intricate
[43:54.240 --> 43:56.240]  and she's absolutely a
[43:56.640 --> 44:01.440]  Tremendous person to have like i've spoken to her in the off the record briefings after events
[44:02.000 --> 44:04.000]  but it's always in the context of
[44:04.960 --> 44:11.680]  You're talking to an expert and it's and it's it's not that she's talking down to you, but it's she's explaining
[44:12.560 --> 44:14.080]  intricate
[44:14.080 --> 44:21.600]  amounts of detailed knowledge to how do I how do I take that intricate knowledge of how this really works to explain it to
[44:21.600 --> 44:24.000]  You in a way that I know will answer your question, you know
[44:24.000 --> 44:31.360]  But she handled the a12 announcement two years ago in september and she knows the soc everything on deeply technical levels
[44:31.360 --> 44:36.320]  Yeah, the the technical stuff is just tremendous. So like when you speak to the people in
[44:36.960 --> 44:38.960]  product marketing
[44:39.520 --> 44:42.160]  And you ask a sort of technical question
[44:42.160 --> 44:47.760]  There is never a it's not like, you know testifying before congress and they're like, uh, let me take a note of that
[44:47.760 --> 44:51.680]  And i'll have someone get back to you. Like it is. How do I explain this to you?
[44:53.600 --> 44:58.320]  Right, it is never like I need to get I need to talk to somebody and i'll get back to you with an answer
[44:58.320 --> 45:05.200]  It's they know the answer and they're just you know, like a good teacher figuring out how do they how you know pedagogically?
[45:05.200 --> 45:07.840]  How do they explain this in in a genuine way?
[45:07.840 --> 45:13.040]  It always seems to me like, you know, like the industrial design team like they they feel an ownership of the iphone's design
[45:13.040 --> 45:16.480]  And the hard engineering team feels an ownership of how it gets produced
[45:16.720 --> 45:22.800]  And the software and interface people feel ownership of how it runs and how it looks but the marketing team has to
[45:23.440 --> 45:28.960]  Keep in constant contact with all of it and make sure all those components end up to be a cohesive thing
[45:29.280 --> 45:33.920]  That somebody wants to buy which is a really important part at the end. Yeah, and I do think
[45:33.920 --> 45:39.360]  You know in a broad sense it it it gets to the advertising part the packaging part
[45:40.320 --> 45:45.440]  It the brand management part which you know is inherently nebulous, right?
[45:45.440 --> 45:49.680]  Like what is the apple brand worth? I mean that is I know that you know
[45:50.320 --> 45:55.600]  Forbes or somebody comes up with a number every year and says, you know, here's here's what these top brands are worth
[45:55.600 --> 45:58.320]  You can't that's just bs right? I mean, but
[45:58.960 --> 46:01.040]  You can't really put a price tag on it
[46:01.040 --> 46:06.320]  Yes, right. I mean, but you can't really put a dollar amount on it. It is so nebulous
[46:06.960 --> 46:10.640]  But there is but it's also undeniable that it's incredibly valuable
[46:12.720 --> 46:19.120]  It does get to the heart though of what I think good marketing is good marketing is inherently honest
[46:19.440 --> 46:24.880]  And it is informed, you know that that by helping to conceive of the scope
[46:26.160 --> 46:27.760]  the design
[46:27.760 --> 46:29.920]  the nature the intended purpose
[46:29.920 --> 46:31.920]  the price
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  of a product
[46:34.160 --> 46:36.160]  the advertising
[46:36.160 --> 46:41.440]  Ideas the way to present it to the public falls out of that because you just describe it, you know
[46:41.440 --> 46:45.680]  You just say here's what it's good for. Here's why the new iphone 11 pro camera
[46:46.240 --> 46:51.040]  Is better than any camera we've ever shipped before and it's not
[46:52.720 --> 46:56.720]  Made up nonsense it is actual technical
[46:56.720 --> 47:04.240]  User relevant this will actually change what you do in your personal life when you take photos of your friends and families
[47:04.240 --> 47:06.160]  And the places you go
[47:06.160 --> 47:08.160]  Back when you were allowed to go places
[47:09.520 --> 47:10.560]  Yeah
[47:10.560 --> 47:15.760]  Photos, you know or where but it's exactly that it's like a good bad marketers will take a product
[47:15.760 --> 47:18.880]  no one wants and try to con them people into buying it right and
[47:19.360 --> 47:22.960]  You know bad good marketers will take a good product and just let it die on the vine
[47:22.960 --> 47:27.040]  but apple has a lot of really good good marketers who have solid products and are
[47:27.760 --> 47:33.120]  Highly capable in explaining to people why they're relevant for them and that's why I think they've had the success that they have
[47:33.200 --> 47:36.400]  Right, and it is also very contrary to these sort of
[47:36.960 --> 47:38.400]  apple hater
[47:38.400 --> 47:40.400]  view of the company
[47:40.400 --> 47:47.520]  Which is that broadly speaking the company's products are overrated overpriced and sold by hype
[47:48.080 --> 47:50.720]  I mean and i'm not trying to a bunch of deluded cultists
[47:50.720 --> 47:54.000]  Yeah, or you know even to a lesser degree i'm trying to
[47:54.560 --> 48:01.760]  Trying to be a little bit more generous to the viewpoint and i'm not using uh, the cult or uh, what are what are some?
[48:01.760 --> 48:03.360]  I'm, i'm trying to avoid
[48:03.360 --> 48:07.840]  phrasing like that, but the idea that it's you know, you're you're buying on hype. I mean i've
[48:08.480 --> 48:11.600]  there's some people i've i've seen some people say that like, uh,
[48:12.640 --> 48:18.160]  You know argue that like a lexus or an acura is just a bunch of better plastic on a honda or
[48:18.160 --> 48:23.920]  Toyota, you know and that if you really know what's go, you know what you're buying you just buy the honda accord instead of the
[48:24.480 --> 48:26.800]  Acura, you're just paying for hype or whatever
[48:27.440 --> 48:32.160]  Whether that's true or not. I don't know about cars to say but you know, there's that mindset towards apple
[48:32.160 --> 48:34.160]  and I really think that that's that's
[48:34.800 --> 48:42.320]  I disagree with it. But I also think you're if you start with that perspective you're going to misunderstand what what this entire
[48:42.320 --> 48:48.000]  Division within apple does and what their role is and why they're the ones on stage telling us about these products
[48:48.800 --> 48:52.640]  Well, I think people also have different personal beliefs on what is valuable
[48:52.640 --> 48:56.560]  But also an intolerance of what other people or how other people see value
[48:56.800 --> 49:02.560]  So for some like an absolute and we'll get to this in a minute an absolute open computing environment is incredibly valuable
[49:02.800 --> 49:08.560]  And if you deny them that you then your product is a joke and for other people an open computing company
[49:08.560 --> 49:13.200]  Then your product is a joke and for other people an open computing system is a nightmare
[49:13.280 --> 49:16.960]  And they just want something that works for them. And if you give them that nightmare, they're going to hate you
[49:17.280 --> 49:23.840]  But they also don't understand why anybody would want that and I think the the hard part is understanding your subjective view
[49:24.160 --> 49:30.160]  Not mistaking it for an objective view, but also understanding and respecting that other people have very different views and priorities and values
[49:31.360 --> 49:36.880]  Um, so yeah, let's get into it, you know, it's um, the app store is
[49:36.880 --> 49:38.880]  Is in a lot of news
[49:39.840 --> 49:43.760]  Uh, how do we start? I mean the xbox thing already seems like old news
[49:44.320 --> 49:50.400]  Yeah, but I guess i'm going but let's start with it as go in chronological order where?
[49:51.340 --> 49:58.640]  Microsoft had toiled for a long time to get their new xbox game pass working on ios
[49:58.960 --> 50:00.960]  as well as android
[50:01.280 --> 50:02.400]  uh
[50:02.400 --> 50:03.840]  this is
[50:03.840 --> 50:05.840]  a product that
[50:05.840 --> 50:11.120]  It it is game streaming and so effectively in a sense and you know
[50:11.120 --> 50:14.720]  you I think you know more about this than me, but it is um
[50:16.160 --> 50:20.480]  It is almost more like the app is a video player
[50:21.040 --> 50:22.720]  that takes
[50:22.720 --> 50:29.520]  You know the game is running on hardware somewhere in the cloud. There is still a native xbox game running on
[50:30.000 --> 50:31.680]  an xbox
[50:31.680 --> 50:33.680]  operating system on a machine
[50:33.680 --> 50:35.280]  On a machine
[50:35.280 --> 50:40.400]  And that machine is not your phone or your ipad. It is somewhere in the cloud and
[50:41.920 --> 50:44.960]  Your app is just effectively a video player
[50:45.440 --> 50:48.640]  but it takes the input from your game controller and
[50:49.360 --> 50:55.200]  It effectively turns your net connection to the xbox into the hdmi connection
[50:55.760 --> 50:59.700]  That you have with a real, you know, it's just replay if you think of it as replacing
[50:59.700 --> 51:04.180]  Sort of and I guess that's not right because it's like netflix for video games. It really is it just the bits
[51:04.180 --> 51:06.740]  They're streaming aren't like a single stream you can
[51:07.380 --> 51:12.020]  Even then like you can press play and pause and do even like our bandersnatch on netflix
[51:12.020 --> 51:18.020]  You could interact with it is really just the bits and and the video and audio is for a gaming experience
[51:18.020 --> 51:20.020]  That's the only real difference, right?
[51:20.420 --> 51:23.300]  And they you know, they were working on it
[51:23.300 --> 51:30.740]  They were working on it. It was somewhat highly publicized test flight beta where I presume they filled up the 10 000 spots
[51:30.900 --> 51:32.340]  very easily
[51:32.340 --> 51:35.060]  Uh, they could only do one game even in the test box environment
[51:35.060 --> 51:41.380]  They could only do master chief for the halo game right because on uh, android they did have multiple games
[51:41.540 --> 51:45.540]  Yeah, and they will and the eventual service is going to ship with hundreds of games. Um
[51:46.260 --> 51:51.540]  And I guess presumably it's because test flight still has to go through
[51:51.540 --> 51:54.580]  This is something I don't know enough about I don't think
[51:55.220 --> 51:58.980]  That test flight betas still go through approval
[51:59.620 --> 52:04.980]  In some way and it's just what less a lot less scrutiny and they don't really
[52:05.860 --> 52:10.580]  They'll let stuff fly like this, you know, I mean presumably if it's
[52:11.460 --> 52:16.180]  Um, I mean just to pick the most glaring example if it's something to do with pornography
[52:16.180 --> 52:21.620]  They're just not even going to let the test flight. Yeah go through. Yeah. Um, I
[52:21.860 --> 52:28.820]  I would guess if it was actual online gambling, you know, if you could play real money blackjack in the app
[52:28.900 --> 52:30.980]  They're not going to even let that through in test flight
[52:31.780 --> 52:33.780]  um
[52:34.340 --> 52:39.300]  So it goes through but even there the rules against having like
[52:40.020 --> 52:42.660]  I forget the exact app store guideline rule
[52:42.660 --> 52:47.700]  But effectively you cannot have a game an app that contains multiple games, you know
[52:47.700 --> 52:49.620]  Because you can't have an app store in the app store
[52:49.620 --> 52:55.140]  You can have like a video store a bookstore or you can have any sorts of stories except for an app or game store
[52:55.380 --> 53:02.020]  And you know where they draw the line on that. I don't know. I mean, obviously there are for just to name an example
[53:02.100 --> 53:04.100]  There's solitaire games. There's you know
[53:04.820 --> 53:09.460]  100 different ways to play solitaire you can have a solitaire game that offers 100
[53:09.460 --> 53:14.980]  Game options, you know that are different types of solitaire games that doesn't run afoul of it
[53:14.980 --> 53:18.020]  but you can't have a solitaire game that also
[53:19.140 --> 53:23.940]  Is a pac-man game. I don't know where the line is drawn. Like I don't know this distribution
[53:24.020 --> 53:26.180]  I think like you can have your own options
[53:26.180 --> 53:30.420]  Maybe even if you're hasbro you could have a couple of your own games in an app, right?
[53:30.420 --> 53:36.180]  You can't be distributing third-party content, right? Right makes it a store so you could make a casino game
[53:36.180 --> 53:42.020]  You know that a doesn't use real money, but offers craps and blackjack and roulette
[53:42.660 --> 53:46.260]  In the same game, but you know, there's obviously a line they draw
[53:46.900 --> 53:52.900]  even in test flight beta they apple apparently either apple drew the line I presume or
[53:53.360 --> 53:58.660]  Microsoft voluntarily drew it but it seems a lot more likely that apple was like, uh, how about one? Yeah
[53:58.660 --> 54:00.660]  They seem salty enough that it sounds like it
[54:02.100 --> 54:03.620]  um
[54:03.620 --> 54:06.260]  and you know it came out and uh
[54:07.220 --> 54:13.300]  Bottom line is microsoft said well, we don't see a path forward for this. So it's going to be android only and we're giving up
[54:13.940 --> 54:17.780]  Uh, and a lot of people were very disappointed in this decision
[54:18.500 --> 54:20.500]  and at microsoft, uh
[54:20.980 --> 54:24.180]  Ios users who wanted to play their xbox games
[54:25.220 --> 54:26.900]  um
[54:26.900 --> 54:30.260]  We don't really know exactly what happened though, right like i've
[54:30.260 --> 54:34.500]  I've you know, and it's fallen off the radar with the epic fortnite thing, but
[54:35.380 --> 54:38.820]  I don't think that this was about the money the 30
[54:39.540 --> 54:44.900]  You know and it i'll just save the financial deal with xbox game passes. It's 15 a month
[54:45.540 --> 54:51.860]  And then you pay microsoft you're 15 a month and then you have xbox game pass and like you said I think at launch next
[54:51.860 --> 54:53.860]  Month, they're going to have like 100 games
[54:54.020 --> 54:59.380]  You know halo and this and that and they're all real xbox games and you can play them and you just keep paying
[54:59.380 --> 55:04.920]  15 a month and you can keep playing all these games and they'll add more games as they become available
[55:05.640 --> 55:07.640]  I don't think this is about
[55:07.880 --> 55:08.920]  um
[55:08.920 --> 55:16.200]  apple wanting microsoft to offer in-app purchase for that subscription and apple would get 30
[55:17.880 --> 55:23.080]  And you know, I think everybody's jumps to the conclusion and you know, not wrongly. It's not it's not
[55:23.720 --> 55:28.200]  Idiotic just to just start with the assumption that it's about money
[55:28.200 --> 55:31.080]  That's actually usually a good assumption, right? You're good
[55:31.880 --> 55:36.680]  You'll be right more often than wrong. If in any of these disputes your first guess is
[55:37.320 --> 55:41.000]  I'll bet it's about money. You're probably right. I think in this case it's ultimately about money
[55:41.240 --> 55:46.520]  Is it short-term about money or is it long-term about money? Is it about the immediate transaction? Right? Yes
[55:47.240 --> 55:48.200]  um
[55:48.200 --> 55:52.200]  I don't think it is I don't you know, and I think that at first thought you're thinking like well
[55:52.200 --> 55:58.840]  One way to do it like what apple, you know, like the way netflix used to work for years and years was you could
[55:59.160 --> 56:01.180]  Sign up for netflix at netflix.com
[56:01.800 --> 56:08.200]  And have a netflix account and then get the netflix app on your iphone and sign in and then you're into netflix
[56:08.440 --> 56:12.920]  And apple doesn't see a penny and you're watching movies for years to come and that's that
[56:13.480 --> 56:20.520]  Or you could download the netflix app on your iphone and you don't have a netflix account yet and you could sign up in the app
[56:20.520 --> 56:22.520]  through the in-app purchasing
[56:22.680 --> 56:30.280]  And you've got a subscription to netflix and that subscription works everywhere else where netflix works on the website on other devices
[56:30.600 --> 56:31.560]  on android
[56:31.560 --> 56:35.240]  um, but your monthly subscription goes through your
[56:35.960 --> 56:40.520]  Apple account I was gonna say itunes account. I guess we're sort of getting away from calling them itunes account
[56:40.520 --> 56:46.200]  But you know, it's just another subscription those subscriptions are still there. I know for a long time
[56:46.200 --> 56:48.440]  I they don't really publish top grossing but
[56:48.440 --> 56:55.000]  For a while after netflix said, you know what? We're not going to offer in-app subscriptions anymore. We're just going to do this on our own
[56:55.720 --> 57:00.600]  Netflix remained for obvious reasons the top grossing or eight, you know
[57:00.600 --> 57:05.720]  One or two on the list of the top grossing apps in the app store because so many people
[57:06.360 --> 57:12.440]  Signed up for their netflix subscriptions in app and I don't think netflix will ever get rid of it because it would be so disruptive
[57:12.440 --> 57:14.440]  You know why take the risk?
[57:14.440 --> 57:22.280]  You know, why take the risk, um, you know, but then obviously with that netflix traditional situation the deal was that
[57:23.240 --> 57:24.600]  You know
[57:24.600 --> 57:26.040]  Lots, I don't know what the breakdown is
[57:26.040 --> 57:30.700]  But lots of people who watch netflix on their ios devices already had their netflix subscription
[57:31.240 --> 57:34.360]  Outside the apple ecosystem and some of them got it within
[57:35.080 --> 57:36.680]  um
[57:36.680 --> 57:40.200]  Is that what my apple wanted from microsoft? I don't think so
[57:40.200 --> 57:46.040]  I don't think that was it at all let alone going more hardcore and saying we're only going to let this on
[57:46.920 --> 57:48.040]  ios
[57:48.040 --> 57:48.900]  if
[57:48.900 --> 57:52.520]  Everybody who uses on ios signs up in app and we get 30
[57:53.400 --> 57:59.480]  Yeah, I don't because now there I I don't think I think even microsoft would be like well, that's that's you're asking too much
[57:59.480 --> 58:02.600]  You know, we're going to sign up a gazillion of these people right on our xbox
[58:03.400 --> 58:05.400]  I don't think it had anything to do with any of that
[58:05.400 --> 58:11.500]  I think they've already done it haven't they because microsoft has other subscription services like um for office 365
[58:12.200 --> 58:17.400]  And I believe they've come to agreement with apple about that. So it's not like it's something that's more like unusual for them
[58:17.960 --> 58:18.840]  Yeah
[58:18.840 --> 58:24.520]  Yeah, and and I think that is a a I think it's contentious and I don't think it has ever sat right with app
[58:24.600 --> 58:31.720]  With microsoft that the microsoft 365 stuff does offer in-app subscriptions at some level, you know
[58:31.720 --> 58:36.280]  And some percentage of the users using them have signed up that way and apple is seeing
[58:37.080 --> 58:39.880]  30 to 15 percent of that money
[58:40.920 --> 58:46.680]  Even though a lot of other users almost certainly most by, you know, overwhelmingly most I would assume
[58:47.300 --> 58:51.400]  365 users who do use ios devices aren't paying through itunes
[58:51.400 --> 58:55.960]  They're getting it through work or they signed up on their computer or something
[58:56.760 --> 58:58.040]  um
[58:58.040 --> 59:02.840]  You know again, that's a dangerous thing to say to call something a computer in this discussion. Yeah
[59:03.880 --> 59:05.880]  They're they're pc or mac
[59:06.200 --> 59:07.160]  um
[59:07.160 --> 59:08.520]  I don't think that was it at all
[59:08.520 --> 59:12.840]  And I think that everybody has sort of come to the conclusion that you know
[59:12.920 --> 59:17.640]  There probably isn't and I think a microsoft statement on this sort of made it clear
[59:18.840 --> 59:23.400]  Um, I know you had a great video on this. So anyway, i'll leave it to you to to pick this up
[59:24.280 --> 59:25.960]  I know thank you, but
[59:25.960 --> 59:27.880]  it seems like just
[59:27.880 --> 59:30.520]  Streaming video for some reason. Sorry. Let me start that again
[59:31.000 --> 59:37.640]  Apps in general and games in specific seem to be treated differently just in general even on android
[59:37.640 --> 59:44.680]  Which is famous for allowing side loading and allowing different payment options has very strict policies about games
[59:44.840 --> 59:46.840]  You know, which again we'll get we'll get to in a minute
[59:47.240 --> 59:52.600]  But streaming games are going to be hugely disruptive because you're paying 15 a month
[59:53.320 --> 59:56.280]  and you're getting a hundred games and there's a lot of
[59:56.280 --> 59:59.480]  I I feel like calling them excuses why we can't let it on their platform
[59:59.480 --> 01:00:03.720]  Like we can't I think what apple said is they can't review every single title
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:07.880]  but they don't need to because it it really is no different than netflix or
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:12.280]  Spotify and they don't review every song and they don't review every movie or every tv show
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:15.240]  And all of those have parental guidance ratings already
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:21.560]  You know, they're either have mature lyrics or they have adult content or they have pg or or whatever it is and anyone
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:25.560]  That gets respected within parental guidance controls. So that's not an issue either
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:31.160]  It's just that these are streaming games instead of streaming video or or streaming audio
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.160]  and
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:35.160]  I honestly think
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:38.360]  And and just overall, you know, like there's no mustache twirling villains in this
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:43.080]  It's not like apple is sitting there going. Ah, ha ha ha we're gonna we're gonna rule this universe and and
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:47.160]  Microsoft or epic are twirling their mustaches back in return
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:53.160]  It's everybody has their own best interest in mind and projects those into what's best for the customer
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:56.760]  Even if we as customers sometimes think that's that's not really best for us. So
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.640]  I think they're being
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:01.800]  conservative they're being careful in how they
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:03.880]  approach
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:08.440]  game streaming and apple doesn't have a game streaming service and some people say that's why but
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:14.600]  Apple didn't have a music streaming service when they allowed spotify on and didn't have a video streaming service when they had
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:20.760]  Netflix on so I think that's really irrelevant as well. It's just I don't think I don't it's one of those things where
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.880]  It's one of those things where we discussed just between us earlier
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:27.800]  They were not prepared for like it was not built with these sorts of services in mind
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:32.440]  Apps were very different when the app store was created and games were very different
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.000]  They were all discrete binary blobs that were largely
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:39.720]  Paid for up front. They were expensive at first the prices dropped
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:45.800]  but just the idea of in-app purchases and the idea of streaming video is nothing that anybody really thought of and
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:50.200]  Apple tends to be a measure 20 times cut once company even if they're being
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:55.080]  Obliterated in the media during the two or three weeks. It takes them to think these things through
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:00.200]  Yeah, I I I think that people just aren't hooked up
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.960]  Just it's human nature and it's you know, and it is
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:11.800]  Political and it's political in the sense of the broadest sense of the word where it's both electoral
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:19.560]  Politics and it's what a lot of people say they hate about politicians in general regardless of where they've these politicians fall
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.040]  along party lines and
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:25.000]  It's why people get frustrated with
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:31.400]  Corporations and the way corporations even Apple even Microsoft even Google
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:37.480]  Even companies that people amazon companies that rank very highly on people's
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:44.920]  Brand affinity rankings right that they don't they people aren't hooked up for the way they communicate to the public
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:48.280]  Where they just they they they get they're very good
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:53.240]  that's it's a very difficult job to be in comms for a company like that and
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:58.360]  Part of it is that it is hard to give a credible non-answer
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:04.200]  To a question you don't want to answer right and politicians aren't ready to answer yet, right?
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:07.800]  Well, whatever whatever the reason of why you don't want to answer it
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:14.520]  But you do need to give some sort of answer you give a non-answer and that's where and
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.080]  Was it a bad answer?
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:25.080]  No, maybe not. I thought at first maybe but maybe it's fine and I the fact that it actually dates back to
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.640]  this this apple
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.480]  statement on xbox game pass
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:35.640]  Which went to business insider and everybody just quoted business insider, but they were giving it to other outlets
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:38.760]  I actually did ask apple and they gave me the same statement. Um
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:45.960]  It's you know for whatever reason in this case people didn't a lot of news outlets just went with the business insider version
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:51.000]  But it was the same but it wasn't new it was it was new for in the context of xbox game pass
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:57.480]  But apple had given it to mark german back in march in the context of was it stadia was a google
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:01.000]  Stadia, I forget which it was some other game streaming thing
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  So you ask a question
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:11.480]  And somebody gives you an answer and you just assume their answer is an answer to the question and so you say why?
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:16.760]  Isn't xbox game pass allowed on the app store and apple's answer?
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:19.880]  Includes this phrasing here. I'll read
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:26.600]  Um, they can absolute gaming services can absolutely launch on the app store as long as they follow the same set of guidelines
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:31.560]  applicable to all developers including submitting games individually for review
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:38.200]  And appearing in charts and search and so everybody, you know, that is apple's statement and everybody read that and thought well
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:41.500]  That means if you need to review each app individually
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:47.160]  How does that possibly work for a streaming service and everybody immediately went to the app store?
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:53.800]  For a streaming service and everybody immediately went to the streaming video like netflix and spotify and you know
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:55.800]  Just to name the two big ones which
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:00.120]  By the size of their libraries. It's impossible, right? It really would be
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:06.840]  A syspian task to try to individually review every video on netflix. There's it's impossible
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:10.280]  Um and everybody, you know thinks well this doesn't even make sense
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:15.160]  But if you take that whole phrase, this is my take on it. I I really I think i'm 100 right
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:17.160]  That if you take the whole phrase
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:25.080]  That they follow the same guidelines applicable to all developers including submitting games individually for review and appearing in charts and search
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:33.240]  Well, what what charts what search they mean app store start charts and search so it's really just a non-answer way
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:38.120]  Of saying why why can't xbox game pass be in the app store?
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:42.440]  What apple's saying is native iphone games can be in the app store
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:46.600]  Which is another way of saying we don't allow game streaming
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.720]  But they don't want to say this they don't want to say it
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.680]  Like they've solved this for other media for example
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:58.440]  Things on spotify don't show up in app store in the apple music charts, obviously, right?
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:02.440]  But you know, they if they choose and netflix famously chooses not to but if they choose
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:08.120]  They can integrate and have it show up in series search and have it show up in up next and do all sorts of things on
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:13.320]  Like the tv app interface for example. Yeah, but it's almost there's ways of handling this. It's almost like the the
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:17.800]  The whole thing is beside the point right? It's not really what they're saying is
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.680]  it's it's less about
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:29.000]  Reviewing individual titles or being in charts and search it's they're just saying there. Here's some good things about native iphone games
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:34.520]  Yes, right native iphone games are reviewed individually and they do appear in our charts and search
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:38.920]  Yeah, and that's not an answer to why can't the x why isn't the xbox game allowed?
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:40.680]  and
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:44.680]  It's you know, I think it's mostly about control and there
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:52.200]  Once you start to talk about platform control, then you're a couple of steps a couple of chess moves away from talking about money
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.680]  um, so yes, there is money involved in what apple is looking at here, but
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:02.120]  I really think that and let's just say this about the xbox game pass
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:06.760]  idea xbox game pass specifically is not a threat to
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:10.680]  native iphone and ipad gaming
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:16.680]  Right other than the fact that every minute somebody spends playing
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:23.240]  xbox game pass on their iphone or ipad if it were available is a minute they wouldn't spend playing
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:28.760]  A native iphone game and there's only a limited amount of attention in the day
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:32.760]  Um, but it's not these aren't made these aren't really iphone games
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:38.920]  These are games that all require xbox controllers and yeah, and apple is the one who allowed ios to have great
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:44.760]  You know first class support for literally the xbox controller and the playstation controller. Um,
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:51.800]  But like you're on the bus going to work and you take out your phone to play a game for a while
[01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:55.000]  You can't use the xbox game pass
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:00.600]  For that unless you have a controller with you and yes, there's like a thing that you can snap onto the sides of an iphone
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:01.800]  To turn it, you know
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:05.560]  It's basically the switch model where you can put hardware controls on the edge
[01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:12.120]  But again in in a lot of contexts where a lot of people spend a lot of time playing games even people who love
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:16.600]  Xbox games that require the controller aren't going to do that, right?
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:22.040]  You're not going to just you know while you're waiting in line to buy something at a store where you're not going to
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:26.680]  Why you're waiting in line to buy something at a store where there's a long queue. You're not going to
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:29.800]  Set up your phone as a switch
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:38.040]  For 90 seconds to play a little bit of xbox. You're just going to play something else, you know, that's meant for the phone
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:39.640]  um
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:45.240]  Also, everybody's like well now it's it's all about apple arcade because apple has a subscription thing
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:46.600]  Yeah
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:50.600]  And they want you to they want you to spend five dollars a month on apple arcade
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:56.360]  Not this but then again now we're talking about direct money and apple's thirty percent of fifteen
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:00.520]  Is like four dollars or is exactly four dollars and fifty cents
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:05.880]  Which is almost five dollars a month for a thing that they don't have any production costs for at all
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:09.880]  And yes money it would drop to fifteen percent after a year
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:15.400]  so it would only be two dollars and twenty five cents instead of that but two dollars and twenty five cents a month as
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.720]  their share of
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:22.360]  Xbox game pass is in the ballpark of the five dollars a month for
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:26.680]  Apple arcade when you consider that they they don't have to do anything
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.320]  right it's
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:33.080]  The thing that gets me with all of these analysis and it's going to bleed into epic too
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:39.640]  Is that these a lot of things that people accuse apple of being in it for the money or turn to these massive
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:42.520]  conspiracies
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:48.040]  It's this fundamental error of always assuming that you are the majority and it happens on twitter a lot, too
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:53.180]  Where anyone who has a strong opinion thinks that by definition ninety percent of other people have the same circumstances
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:59.960]  And opinion and it's it's these are not big numbers for apple and i've joked about this before like when people accuse apple of doing
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.880]  things to maintain their mfi
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:08.600]  They're made for iphone accessory profit that that is literally cushion change for apple compared to iphone profits
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:12.760]  Most of these things like the the xbox game pass thing is not a mainstream concern
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:18.840]  I fully believe streaming gaming is inevitable the same way streaming video and audio is and they'll have massive mainstream appeal
[01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:20.040]  eventually
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:25.080]  but right now apple's problem isn't understanding and coming up with policy and
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:29.960]  Structure for it for xbox game pass or for google. Um
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:36.680]  Stadia, it's just figuring out handle handle it how to handle it in general and once that happens all of this will be folded in
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.360]  but these are these are like the
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:46.280]  Like the smallest the smallest niche concerns and the lowest amount of margin problems
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.160]  They just get an incredible amount of online attention
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:54.120]  Yeah, I do think though that microsoft must have thought that it was going to be about the money
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:11:01.000]  Because they clearly thought they had a pretty good chance and I kind of think they assumed that this was going to be worked out
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.120]  I really do think and I have no inside information on it
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:09.640]  And I think the number of people who are privy to the actual negotiations is very small and on both sides
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.200]  Aren't the sort of people who blab?
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:16.680]  You know probably phil shiller personally
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:20.200]  Yes, honestly and satya nadella. Yeah
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:27.820]  But I really think that microsoft went into this thinking it would be a fight over where between 30 and 15
[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:35.580]  30 and 15 and what level of prominence the in-app signup needs to have and those sort of things and then apple was like
[01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:38.540]  No, we really we don't even want your money, you know, we don't want it
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:42.460]  We don't want if we don't even want 30 percent of this. We're we're not allowing it
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:44.860]  um
[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:48.220]  And I think microsoft was taken aback by that I do
[01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:51.900]  Um because I think if they'd known it going in I think that you know
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:56.700]  They wouldn't have wasted the time developing it and I don't know how much time they spent on the ios version
[01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:01.600]  And particularly that wasn't applicable just as much to the android version
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:03.520]  um
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:08.000]  But you can definitely see the other thing, you know is by all accounts
[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:14.400]  iPhone and android aren't really equivalent demographics. I mean not even that that's
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:22.640]  I'm underselling the differences, you know, ios users are more willing and likely to spend money than android users
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:29.840]  And so just counting up the number of android devices in use versus the number of iphone and ipad devices in use
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:37.760]  Doesn't give you an accurate picture of all of the market and to me the the real eye-opening number recently was david hannemeyer hanson's
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:45.360]  Posted last month that was part of his testimony to congress in the antitrust hearings about hey
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:52.480]  And that now this is post launch of hey and after they had, you know, a month or six weeks of of
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:55.040]  You know market data
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:13:00.240]  Um, and they have you know, they have an android version that I use I i've I still use hey the email
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:07.040]  I have it on my phone and I have it on my pixel four and it is as good. It's very similar app because
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:13.120]  uh the base camp company they the way they develop software is sort of a web app first and that
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:16.240]  Especially the iphone version. I know this is a whole discussion. I don't want to have but
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:24.000]  It's not quite a web app and wrapped in an iphone thing the iphone app in particular is native in a lot of ways. Um, but
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:31.920]  If you it's very very similar design you can see how they the android version and the iphone version are it's like, uh,
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:38.080]  You know the way that games are often the same if the game is on both platforms. It's you know, very very minor differences
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:42.960]  That they're the number of people paying for hey who are using an apple device
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:47.840]  I think they I think it was like 90 percent of their users use at least one apple device
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:54.320]  Now i'm not sure what that number means because it could mean that they have an android phone but use a mac
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:14:01.120]  Which I think would probably especially for their audience is quite possibly a large number of their android users
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:05.760]  Because they're using android phones, but they're developer types nerds who use
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:08.560]  A macbook for like web app development
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:15.600]  But it was and something like 75 of their mobile payers are on ios devices
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:20.080]  Which isn't what you think of as the market share for you know
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:25.360]  This certainly it's not it's not the market share for iphone versus android phone 75 being iphones
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:33.200]  You know the the number of people who pay for services like a 99 dollar a year email service is way higher on
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.200]  on ios
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:40.480]  Yeah, absolutely. Well the market that's that's one of the things you get into when you're discussing how much dominance someone has over a market
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:42.080]  right so like globally
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:47.680]  Uh apple share is tiny. I think it's like 20 something percent in some countries in europe. It's
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:53.120]  Infinitesimal there's some countries where just android is vastly vastly more used and it goes down
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:57.440]  I think into the teens of usage and then in north america, they have a
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.160]  Majority of usage like there's more people using iphones
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:02.800]  With american teens, you never know how good the data is
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:09.440]  but one of the research firms said it's like 83 of american teens have them and the other and two more percent want them right don't
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:10.480]  have them
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:16.160]  And so you by defining those markets all who does like who does xbox streaming gaming?
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:22.720]  Appeal to if they really want to attach to north american teens then they obviously really badly want on the ios market, right?
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:24.620]  So skip the age
[01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:27.120]  Demographics and just go by who spends money
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:31.280]  Well, you want to be on the iphone and if you go by the age demographics, who do you want?
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:34.640]  Well, you probably want teenagers, uh, then you want the iphone, you know
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:40.880]  So whatever their internal spreadsheet was on the number of people they expect to be playing xbox game pass
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.600]  on their mobile phones, um
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:52.000]  The iphone's role in that excel spreadsheet, uh, was certainly not based on unit sales of devices
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.200]  And it was far more, you know, and if they could pick if you just went to satya nadella and said well
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:03.360]  I can't explain why but you have a decision all I can tell you is you have a choice you can either have xbox game pass
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:09.040]  On iphone or have it on android and he would before you even finish the sentence. He'd say oh iPhone
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:12.000]  Yeah, because there's more money with their own apps, right?
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.880]  Like they've been making mobile versions of their products or ipad before they've been making them from right there's there's more money
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:18.880]  You know, there's more money to be had
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:25.600]  Um, so I think that from apple's perspective it's not you know
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:30.320]  I think there's part of this idea that the gaming is so lucrative and it is
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:37.840]  You know and we can get into this idea that ios in the broad sense is a console like system for apps period
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:42.720]  But when it comes to games specifically is a one-to-one comparison, you know that
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:48.320]  It it is like a gaming platform that also does a whole lot more
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:49.760]  yeah, um
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:51.040]  and
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.040]  No gaming platform
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:57.520]  That's a console like system allows game streaming
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.720]  You know, nobody is irate that the nintendo switch doesn't have
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:08.960]  Xbox game pass, you know and even microsoft didn't you know as far as ios
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:17.120]  You know and even microsoft didn't you know, as far as I know there was no 10,000 person beta of xbox game pass for switch
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:22.240]  Or playstation for them. Yeah or playstation and xbox, you know
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:27.840]  They're not taking xbox and xbox doesn't have a version of playstation's game streaming thing
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:30.320]  Which is very cool
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:37.040]  That's the first place i've ever seen game streaming my son has a playstation 4 and he has I forget what playstation calls their thing
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:41.520]  And but he can play a lot of old and and there's his mix their service
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:43.680]  It's the same subscription fee
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:49.200]  Some of the games you download to your playstation and you play them as a downloaded game like other playstation games
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:52.960]  but some you can just stream especially the older ones that are smaller and he can just
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:57.680]  Stream games and if he just gets like an inkling to play an old game
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:59.600]  He doesn't have to wait for it to download
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:02.960]  You can just like go pick it and stream it and i'm like really you're straight
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:05.760]  and it was like the first time I saw somebody doing it and I was like
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:10.800]  This is very impressive and i'm you know, it shows my age that I just assumed the latency of a network
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:18.580]  Is you know going to make twitch like gaming not twitch the video streaming service, but twitchy reflexes
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:26.320]  Um, yeah, it works, you know, but there's no way xbox is going to host game streaming from another company and yet people
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:30.160]  You know and here we get into the contentious argument where some people are saying yeah
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:33.840]  So it makes sense and what the hell was microsoft thinking that apple was going to allow
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:36.960]  a game streaming service on their game platform
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:43.600]  And whereas others are saying what are you nuts ios is nothing like a game platform
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:47.680]  Yeah, I mean we all bring our own personal desires to it
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:51.520]  But you know if you go back and watch the introduction, you know when steve jobs introduced the app store
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.160]  He was incredibly clear from the beginning that he was using a console model. Yeah
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:02.080]  and that's so I i've you know, i've been talking about this on dithering with ben thompson and
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:05.920]  Arguing with people very nicely. It's actually been a very fun and it's you know
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:12.320]  It reinvigorated my belief that human beings are capable of respectful intelligent open-minded argument
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:15.280]  The problem
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:21.600]  That i've gotten into by making this argument that not really that ios is like a console
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.600]  But it is a console system
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.480]  Conceptually and was right from the beginning
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:34.080]  Is that some people hear console as a word and they immediately go to game console that you don't have to say that
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:37.920]  Game consoles aren't a type of computing console. They are
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:45.440]  It's it's like dropping the tele from telephone. It's the same word. I say i'm going to call you on the phone
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:47.520]  I'm going to call you on the telephone
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:55.120]  It's the same thing. I say ios is a console and there's a lot of people who hear me saying i've ios is the same thing
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:58.000]  saying i've ios is exactly like
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:01.840]  Switch and xbox and playstation 4 no more than that
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:07.440]  No less than that exactly like that and they say that's the nonsense and that is that would be nonsense
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:10.000]  If that's the way you hear it, that's not the way I mean it
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:12.080]  I mean console in a broader term
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:18.080]  and it's just that game consoles are the ones that have been around for decades and have popularized the
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.000]  basic
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000]  business model
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.760]  Well, and also it's how we view it as opposed to how the vendor views it
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:28.800]  Apple clearly views it as a console and you don't have to agree with them
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:35.040]  You can think they're completely wrong and out to lunch and bananas and you can view it as it should be an open console
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:39.540]  Just just to touch briefly on epic like they were super angry that microsoft's
[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:45.120]  HoloLens was closed and they couldn't have the unreal engine on it and they went to war with microsoft over that
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:48.240]  Because microsoft viewed it as a console like the xbox
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:51.520]  Right and we look at the xbox like it's okay to be a console
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:56.000]  But most of these game consoles have web browsers you can get skype you can get netflix
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:00.000]  You can get a host of apps that aren't video games on them as well and they are
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:05.280]  Literally inside almost the same as any computer that you would use to run general purpose apps
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:09.860]  It's just the philosophy behind them is different right and with the xbox in particular
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:15.600]  And again, right? I don't want to get into like a college, you know, sit around smoking dope, you know
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:20.320]  We're talking about the philosophy the nature of what's the nature of what's the nature of a computer man?
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:27.360]  but like the xbox in particular going back to the very first xbox was literally
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  the the basic idea is
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:36.800]  Let's take a gaming pc that we can put together into a into a size that would fit in
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:40.420]  somebody's entertainment system underneath most TVs
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:42.800]  and replace the
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:45.860]  pc connectors in the back with home entertainment connectors
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:48.480]  and um
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:52.320]  and sell windows games using the console model and if you took
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:22:00.160]  the xbox even today if you took it out of the box or the the the packet, you know, what do you call it the uh,
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:03.040]  Just took it out of the case
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:08.080]  And just took the internal components out and took a gaming pc out of its case
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:13.120]  Which is a lot easier to do and put it out. You couldn't tell them apart. You you could we used to do that
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:15.200]  We used to mod the original xbox all the time, right?
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:20.400]  You you know, you'd have to like look at the actual green boards and see if there's some small print that says that
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:24.800]  It's the you know, it says something is stamped xbox, you know before you could tell it apart
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:32.000]  Um conceptually I had linux on mine for a while, right and much like I didn't even know that was possible
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:36.400]  But much like how much like how apple shares operating system
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.720]  Core core os across its platforms
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:43.680]  The xbox runs a variant of windows 10, you know, and so people say okay
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:50.240]  So there's a web browser, but nobody uses it as their main web browser, but that's just by design, right?
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:57.280]  There's no reason that a kid couldn't go to college with their xbox as their computer
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:02.320]  you know go with a computer and a monitor and put the xbox on their desk and
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:07.520]  Have the xbox run things like an email client and their a good version of a web browser
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:14.960]  And do all of their work on the same, you know that one device that's just by design that they don't let things like that
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:21.760]  Go through and that they don't it isn't designed to run in a context where you're going to open up a bunch of browser tabs
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:27.360]  And read it, you know read the news on your xbox, but it certainly could it's just limiting, you know
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:33.360]  it's sort of like an alternate universe where
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:41.360]  Circa 2008 steve jobs who was still on the fence. I guess it would have been 2007. Steve jobs is still on the fence
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:48.320]  Of whether they should have third-party native apps at all. What if apple has said, okay, but only games
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:56.160]  Where you know, no native apps was the original iphone message you we have a sweet solution where you can write web apps
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:24:00.640]  What if they had said instead? Okay, we are going to allow
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:06.320]  Third-party apps, but we're not a games company. So we'll let games, you know, and here's uh,
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:10.400]  Say we'll partner with netflix like we do with youtube and you'll have like a netflix app, right?
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:14.160]  Uh, fine. Yeah, and we'll have you know, it's stuff like that
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:18.960]  Um, there's the you know, it obviously would have been leaving a lot of opportunity on the table
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:24.080]  But in theory, there's no reason they couldn't have done that, you know, and then what would be the argument now?
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:26.080]  There's really very little argument
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:30.800]  Yeah, and all i'm parsing out is that it's it's a different argument to say it isn't a console
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:35.760]  Then saying it shouldn't be a console and I think that's what gets lost sometimes it does
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:42.240]  But uh the other thing that i've noticed so i've noticed that the word console means something specific to games to say
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:48.000]  Means something specific to games to some people and when I explained that I don't mean games specifically I mean the model
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:52.960]  Then they say oh, okay. I see what you mean now. I thought you just like an infotainment center
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:54.480]  Yeah, that's also a console
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:25:00.080]  I don't but if you know and somebody looked at the some some smart ass looked in the dictionary and the dictionary has an entry
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:01.840]  that says uh
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:07.440]  You know console like definition three is a computer device primarily for playing games
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:12.080]  And they're like well that you know, that means the dictionary says it's just for games and I said well
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:15.120]  Okay, the same dictionary merriam websters look up the phone
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:20.340]  Yeah, and trust me the merriam webster entry for phones as a telephone
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:25.200]  So, but there are dedicated consoles like air people who control aircraft and stuff
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:31.920]  There are purpose-built consoles for almost everything across industries. They're just not usually consumer related right and you know
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:38.080]  I get it, but there's also the other way that I have lost people with this argument
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:42.000]  Is and and again and you're very right that there is the should
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:46.400]  angle which again that is a whole thing that we could talk about for hours and
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:53.200]  will be talking about for hours and hours to come and on videos and you in columns and
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:26:00.320]  Podcasts to come and it's a great argument and then what makes it a great argument is there's validity to multiple arguments with
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:02.640]  across the spectrum on that
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:08.480]  But even without the argument of whether apple should be treating it the thing that I have noticed is
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:13.120]  There is a significant number of people with very strong opinions about
[01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:15.740]  ios
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:17.760]  Who
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:24.160]  Don't hadn't been under hadn't really opened their eyes to how much it is a console
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:28.160]  Yeah, and when you point this out, they are
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:34.720]  Angry about it. It is very it's an electric reaction and they are offended and it really does
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:36.960]  date back
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:38.960]  25 years
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.160]  to
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:44.160]  Mid to late 90s arguments there where richard stallman was talking about
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:49.520]  You know certain chips that microsoft wanted introduced into pcs for safe boot, you know, and um,
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:56.880]  Well jobs and was were arguing about whether it should be a sealed appliance right open computing platform decades ago. Yeah
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:01.680]  Yeah, yeah, and you know, i've heard I saw some people say well, you know, you shouldn't use the word console
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:03.680]  That means games you should call it an appliance
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.160]  but to me appliance of
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:11.760]  You know like your refrigerator might have a computer in it, but you don't install apps on it, right to me
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:15.040]  The console model is is the expandability notion
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:21.920]  You know that that it's sure my dishwasher I my dishwasher actually is some sort of computer and I hate it
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:26.640]  I really do saying that i'm sure there must be an android fridge out there and someone's installing apps on it right now
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:29.680]  Well, there is remember tim cook made fun of samsung for making that
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.440]  Or maybe I forget if they came out with the fridge after he made fun of it or not
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:35.680]  but uh, he called them on it, but
[01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:39.680]  Appliance to me implies and i'm talking in broad terms. I don't know
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:41.360]  Maybe we don't have a great word
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:46.640]  But I think console works as long as you say that xbox playstation and switch are game
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:53.060]  Consoles and they're the consoles that have been established for a long time. Ios is an app console. It always has been
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:59.140]  And but a lot of you hate that word. I mean you could call it unmanaged versus managed computing environments
[01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:04.500]  You can choose whatever word you want, right? But it's there's a lot of people out there who really see
[01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:07.140]  that the that ios is
[01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:09.620]  like the mac
[01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:16.180]  But for like a little asterisk like a footnote that says but right now apple makes everything go through the app store
[01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:20.180]  And if they would just like erase this asterisk, then they'd be it would be the same
[01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:24.100]  and that's what they want very much they want the
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:31.940]  iphone and ipad to be like the mac in terms of being able to run software from anywhere
[01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:37.620]  uh that does things that aren't going through the app store that apple would never approve and
[01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:40.100]  You know, it's
[01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:43.780]  It is they're completely missing how apple has talked about it
[01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:51.300]  Uh, ever since it came out, they're completely not really looking at how it's been run every single step of the way since it came out
[01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:55.300]  What they're looking at and where they're not necessarily crazy
[01:28:56.100 --> 01:29:01.540]  Is that at a technical level? Yeah, you can look at it and see that it's not like
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:08.340]  Not that it wouldn't take work. Not that apple has to erase like one line of code. That's like an if statement if
[01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:14.660]  If if ios then yeah, if ios then this and just erase that and then all of a sudden it's exactly like the mac
[01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:18.660]  But you can see how yes, technically, you know the work
[01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:22.500]  you know to make ios have something like um,
[01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:28.740]  You know the mac where you can just download an app package from a website and click one
[01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:33.620]  You know permission dialogue and have it installed you could see that
[01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:38.820]  But that's not how apple's ever talked about it. And the other thing people often say is they say apple never called it a console
[01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:44.260]  Well, of course, they don't you know, it's not really a pleasant word. I don't really think you hear xbox
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:47.940]  And nintendo talk about their platforms as consoles
[01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:51.540]  Yeah, I think it's also
[01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:58.100]  Really important to point out that most of the time when we have these discussions is with incredibly technologically savvy computer literate people
[01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:00.740]  And going back to what I said earlier
[01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:07.060]  Everyone mistakes themselves for a majority and they just believe deeply that what they say reflects the opinions of most people
[01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:09.620]  Even when it's totally not the case
[01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:15.700]  And we've had open computing environments for decades and one of the things that steve jobs was most ardent on
[01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:22.020]  Was making computers ever more accessible to ever more the greater amounts of people of mainstreaming computing technology
[01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:27.380]  And his vision of doing that was making them easier to use by making them more controlled
[01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:34.100]  And when you when you step through apple 2 to mac, uh to the iphone and ipad which which he thought were far more important
[01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:39.880]  To mainstream people than than the mac even was that providing that controlled managed experience
[01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:44.020]  Opened them up. He wasn't restricting their rights. He was relieving their burden
[01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:48.420]  Like he didn't think that humans should have to manage or deal with that complexity
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:54.020]  And he believed that a lot of people found that off-putting if not alienating it made them feel dumb
[01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:57.380]  And that they deserve to have these as tools not as
[01:30:57.940 --> 01:31:02.900]  Sort of workbenches but as as tools that they shouldn't have to worry about, you know
[01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:08.600]  Finding other sources. Can they trust it? And it's also an important part of this argument that I think gets left behind
[01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:15.140]  Is whether the iphone as a platform is successful whether people are more willing to spend money on it
[01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:18.740]  Whether it's adopted by users who are more willing to spend money on it
[01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:25.540]  Because it is users who appreciate the way that it works largely because of how apple has managed the platform
[01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:31.540]  And I always test against android. I always look and say well android doesn't have these things
[01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:38.260]  So show me the app that can exist under android that can exist under ios that is changing the world and improving lives
[01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:41.940]  And i'm sure there are a bunch of apps that are on android that aren't on ios
[01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:46.180]  Emulators and all sorts of other things that are not on android
[01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:49.220]  But all the big ones like instagram and lyft and you know
[01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:54.420]  Just any almost any app you can think of is on the iphone almost always first quite often still
[01:31:55.060 --> 01:32:01.940]  More polished than it is on android and more available to people and by changing it by making it I joke about this
[01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:06.660]  I always talk to developers and they tell me what they want and I said, but so you want the google play store?
[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:09.620]  And they say yes, and I said well, why aren't you on that? And they say because I hate it
[01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:13.620]  And reconciling those statements. It seems like it's going to change the world
[01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:19.060]  And reconciling those statements. It seems to be really hard for people to me. One of the concepts
[01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:25.000]  That we're talking about is encapsulation encapsulation that you encapsulate
[01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:28.740]  Uh complexity
[01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:29.860]  in
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:32.900]  A way that is easier understood and managed
[01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:39.140]  And when you do and again, it comes back to one of the most recurring themes and everything
[01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:41.780]  I ever talk about or write about is trade-offs
[01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:43.780]  trade-offs and
[01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:47.380]  People it's like you said earlier about twitter people want there to be an answer
[01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:51.720]  That's zero or a hundred and they don't want to hear that. The answer is actually 57
[01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:58.180]  And it's mostly towards 100, but there's actually 43 good points on the other side, you know
[01:32:58.260 --> 01:33:00.660]  And that's just the way it is, but that's where the answer is
[01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:03.300]  um, they just don't want to hear it, but
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:06.480]  encapsulating complexity
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:09.380]  inherently involves trade-offs, um
[01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:17.220]  um, it's just but one of the positives is it makes it more accessible to people who don't understand the
[01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:20.020]  the technical underpinnings
[01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:23.940]  And
[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:28.900]  People who do understand them often don't see the downsides to it, you know
[01:33:29.060 --> 01:33:31.700]  but I think that that sort of and I think this
[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:36.340]  I think a lot of people who are arguing that ios should be
[01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:42.440]  Should not is but should be less of a console and should be more open or are just completely
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:44.720]  overlooking
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:52.420]  Completely the advantages that it has to many many people that it's not that it's I think there's so many people making the argument
[01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:54.840]  That apple is very wrong and has an indefensible
[01:33:55.540 --> 01:33:58.740]  Ethical and perhaps legal position on this whole thing
[01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:01.060]  um
[01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:07.140]  That on the ethical side, they don't really they just completely assume that apples
[01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:11.700]  That the ios has succeeded despite apple's tight-fisted control
[01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:16.580]  And not because of the tight-fisted control but think about you know
[01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:21.380]  And and the console model if you go back and again this also comes to one of my big themes
[01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:28.180]  Is that where you start from matters because it colors how people see things going forward
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:35.620]  And if you think about game consoles you think about like the atari 2600 and the original nintendo nes system
[01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:41.380]  Yeah, where they were actual cartridges that the game was on chips in hardware
[01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:43.220]  and
[01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:44.420]  the
[01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:50.340]  The concept to the user was exactly what you saw right you you had
[01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:56.500]  The game console in front of you hooked up to your tv and if you turned it on without a cartridge in
[01:34:56.500 --> 01:35:01.140]  Nothing happened. You didn't even there wasn't like a system, you know, I forget it
[01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:07.220]  I don't think nes had one but I know atari 2600 didn't you didn't even get a picture without a cartridge in the cartridge slot?
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:08.500]  There was nothing
[01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:14.260]  Yeah, and you put asteroids in and uh, I think yeah with the 2600
[01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:17.220]  They used to even recommend strongly that you turn it off
[01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:21.540]  Take the cartridge out put a new cartridge and turn it back on and my sister would just
[01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:26.020]  Yank cartridge out and put it back in and I was so deathly afraid that she was going to break it
[01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:31.860]  Because I was like, oh my god, I I was like I wasn't even it wasn't even like my parents won't buy us a new one
[01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:33.860]  I was like we might have to go three days without it
[01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:35.780]  or whatever
[01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:36.980]  um
[01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:38.980]  I was like, you know, listen, you know
[01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:44.020]  Yeah, exactly, but I still have that with the stupid sd cards on max today, right?
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:50.580]  But same original trauma the idea of how do you install asteroids was very obvious you put the cartridge in the slot
[01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:55.700]  And yep, how do you uninstall it? Well, you take it out and then you put space invaders in
[01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:58.180]  that and
[01:35:58.180 --> 01:36:04.260]  Where we've gotten today with the xbox playstation switch is obviously incredibly more powerful
[01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:11.700]  Computer systems and you can install things in more complicated ways, but that basic model is still there where you get the app
[01:36:12.820 --> 01:36:16.200]  From an official source and it's completely encapsulated
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:22.600]  Completely encapsulated and the assumption that the game even on a completely modern
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:28.600]  Not even out yet xbox x system x coming later this year
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:35.400]  Which is the most you know in the playstation 5 the most advanced game console computers ever made
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:39.080]  The idea is that no matter what you do when you get a new game
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:46.520]  The game isn't going to like overwrite the system and create a launch item so that the next time you turn on your playstation 5
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:53.320]  whatever game you just bought now puts up a pop-up menu every time your system starts up and
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:57.080]  It's oh and when you delete the game because you don't even like it
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:01.560]  it leaves behind a bunch of files that you have to clean up and stuff like you
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:05.160]  People are like no no games consoles don't work like that, right?
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:10.120]  You're they're all everything's neatly encapsulated and if you delete the game you delete all traces of the game
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:12.920]  But it's not like a voluntary compliance thing
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:19.080]  You can't even get your game into the platform unless you comply with the rules, you know that that are
[01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:27.240]  Voluntary or otherwise whether they're sandboxing hardware things people just assume that that's the case because that's where game consoles came from because they used
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:30.700]  To literally be enforced by the fact that it was a hardware cartridge
[01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:37.340]  And the fact that ios and android look like mac os 10 and linux
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:45.740]  Derivative computers that just happen to run in your pocket and you know that there's a linux kernel on the android and
[01:37:46.220 --> 01:37:49.100]  A darwin kernel and you know ui
[01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:56.060]  Kit and appkit are similar and a lot of the frameworks like swift ui are literally exactly the same
[01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:58.620]  It's you know
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:02.060]  Technically, yeah, there's a lot of similarities but yet
[01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:09.820]  The the neatness of ios where you cannot mess up your iphone by installing an app. You can't do it
[01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:11.900]  There's nothing that can be done
[01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:16.860]  through an app you get through the app store that will mess up your system or leave behind traces or
[01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:23.520]  All of a sudden you get weird pop-up menus every time you get a phone call because you installed a thing from facebook
[01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:26.380]  Doesn't happen, right?
[01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:30.780]  And whereas on our macs and pcs stuff like that happens all the time
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:34.460]  I don't think people
[01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:37.020]  Understand just how much of an appeal that is, you know
[01:38:37.660 --> 01:38:42.940]  Yeah, it it's that it's that joking cliche. It just works thing but for like I had
[01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:47.660]  Right now it's also in vogue to say that you know apple really didn't do much with the app store that there were
[01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:53.900]  Ways to download apps and there were ways to buy apps previously and but I was one of those people I had you know
[01:38:53.900 --> 01:39:00.140]  you know since the handspring visor and the palm trio and the windows mobile phones i've had all of them and I have
[01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:06.060]  Receipts for buying like the 48 sticky app that crashed constantly and me trying to remember
[01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:09.340]  Which of the eight different web stores I bought it off of
[01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:16.620]  It was just it was not a model where most people were doing it. It was a very very very niche
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:19.580]  Activity and what apple did is what they've done
[01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:23.580]  That's generated their success for for years is that they figured out a way to package
[01:39:24.700 --> 01:39:27.820]  To package technology in a way that had massive mainstream appeal
[01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:32.140]  And the app store is an apple product in the same way that the iphone is did the same thing
[01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:37.340]  It took a bunch of sort of quirky hard to use disparate technologies and made a cohesive product out of it
[01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:41.200]  And hugely successful business and they did the same thing with app distribution
[01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:47.500]  I think looking at it differently than that is non-helpful and i'm not saying that I agree with how it's run. I think that
[01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:54.780]  2020 is very different than 2008 and that there are strong arguments for changing the percentage base because
[01:39:55.820 --> 01:39:59.820]  It's really not that much money for apple people have this idea that apple's fighting over this
[01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:04.780]  It is it is literally pocket change for apple. I forget how many billions it moves the needle
[01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:10.620]  But it's like it's sing. It's very low single digit for a company that makes hundreds of billions of dollars all the time
[01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:16.540]  And I also think that side loading is important, especially in an age where china can block vpn apps
[01:40:16.540 --> 01:40:18.540]  And america might block tik tok
[01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:25.340]  But it's it's not because I think there's anything fundamentally broken with the app stores because I think that we're living in a time that requires
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:31.980]  Um requires a more flexible approach just because the world is becoming a more chaotic place
[01:40:32.620 --> 01:40:36.220]  But I think a lot of this and this is where I get into a lot of trouble from a lot of people
[01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:41.260]  I think there's a lot of frustration about apps and games moving from
[01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:46.060]  Valuable expensive niche scarce products into
[01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:51.820]  Abundant commodity if not unit-based then rapidly becoming subscription
[01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:56.780]  based the same way we've seen news transformed by google and
[01:40:57.340 --> 01:41:04.300]  Movies and videos transformed by netflix and music by spotify the same forces are being applied to apps and games
[01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:08.240]  And I don't even think apple understands it yet, but I think it's making a lot of developers
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:11.120]  Who want to have successful apps angry in the same way?
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:16.240]  It makes a lot of youtubers who want to have huge audiences and don't have them really angry
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:21.760]  And all of these things serves serve as very good targets for channeling that anger
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:24.720]  Yeah, I think so
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:25.360]  um
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:29.520]  And just like I don't think it would change like I think apple could give developers almost everything they want and I still think
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:36.160]  Developers would have to work really really hard to figure out how to find a valuable niche or become a breakout mainstream
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:42.480]  Sensation and it wouldn't just magically make any developer super affluent overnight. Yeah
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:50.900]  I really do think though just to tie off the xbox game pass thing that it's in some ways about games specifically
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:55.760]  Where they don't want these meta games that are games within an app
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:42:00.560]  And even though xbox game pass isn't mobile first
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:08.400]  The technology once you're talking about streaming the technology is there where somebody could easily make one if they it's that opening the door
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:14.080]  To streaming and so I think if they were going to make an exception and they made it for xbox game pass
[01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:18.800]  Specifically the fact that you're still playing xbox games that require a hardware controller
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:26.320]  And aren't really meant for the sort of mobile context that most mobile games are including apple arcade games. It's not really
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:28.400]  disruptive
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:32.480]  to apple's current game market for ios
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:39.600]  But opening the door to streaming software in general streaming from the cloud
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:46.880]  Is and I really think that it's it's almost the inverse of the epic argument where the epic argument
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:50.400]  They're trying to say it's about everything, but they're really talking about games
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:57.040]  The xbox one everybody's talking about games and the competition with apple arcade games
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:59.360]  But I really think that from apple's perspective
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:04.640]  It's the broader perspective of they don't have a policy in place yet for streaming software
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:11.440]  Which is clearly coming it's coming to games first. It's here for games. It's the present tense thing for games
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:18.160]  It's obviously as as cloud computing is more prominent and latency and ubiquitous
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:25.040]  5g and good lte networking is in more places. It's it's coming and
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:31.440]  It's it's coming and apple isn't doesn't have an answer for it yet, you know, and how in terms it
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:37.540]  What what does it mean for a company that wants to have control over all of the apps on this platform?
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:44.020]  You know, it's sort of like microsoft when the web browser started becoming a thing is they only understood
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:46.960]  Windows as office apps. They didn't have any
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:52.080]  Understanding at all of what google docs would be and it took like 30 years
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:57.360]  But scott mcneally's thin client future is finally getting closer to reality, you know, and
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:04.720]  Our you know, our mutual dear friend guy english sent me something about that when this whole thing broke
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:09.280]  He'd sent me, you know and guys like us where he has a long memory and remembers stuff like that
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:11.680]  But it is true the thin client
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:15.920]  From that era and you know oracle was a big player in that too
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:18.000]  um
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:19.040]  it
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:24.000]  It always did make sense that it would happen eventually, you know
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:30.080]  Just not it's people weren't thinking it through at the time, right same way that the web became, you know
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:31.920]  Web apps would be a future
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:37.440]  But everybody at the time thought that the web would be the new windows and you'd run apps that were just like the apps
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:41.840]  You ran on windows, but they'd go through your web browser and it's like that doesn't really make sense
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:46.240]  Because it's just not good for it and the payload grew faster than the delivery system every time
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:49.520]  Right, and just just you could just look at it, you know what I mean?
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:56.640]  Like there's a reason gmail is very super super duper popular and doesn't look like have windows or mac app at all
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:01.600]  You know, yeah, it's just you know, hey doesn't look like a mac app or a windows app
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:04.560]  It looks like a web app and that's you know
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:12.240]  You know not good or bad in and of itself. It just is what it is. But the you know, it did become the de facto
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:18.800]  Lowest common denominator software platform. Yeah. All right. Let's take a break. I'm going to thank our third and final sponsor
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:23.280]  New sponsor they sponsored I think two episodes ago, but i'm so happy to have them raycon

[01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:58.480]  Like the hold my beer order
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:06.400]  Right, like wow this fight with microsoft and apple over the future of iowa's gaming and apple's tight-fisted
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:10.240]  Control over the app store and what type of games and stuff can be on it
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:12.960]  is fascinating what drama and
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:15.600]  Tim swinney is like
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:18.400]  Hold my beer hold hold a keg of beer. Yes
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:21.760]  Yeah, good old tim swinney, uh
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:24.480]  You know, and so it's fun like somebody
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:29.040]  Somebody uh, you know, why are we so interested in this? Why is it getting so much attention?
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:35.040]  Well, it's a lot of drama and it is, you know, I don't think it's and it is complex
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:37.120]  It's not a simple clear-cut
[01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:38.640]  argument
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:44.800]  Um, there's a lot of money at stake. There's two big companies with or three if you count google
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:52.240]  Um people have very strong opinions that run a gamut. It's not just two binary positions. Um, yeah
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:53.440]  Yeah
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:55.280]  It's a lot of drama
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:48:00.960]  And it was engineered to be dramatic. I mean I had videos and it was just designed to be dramatic from the start
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:06.240]  Yeah, it's you know, it's i've drawn the analogy, uh dithering to a chess game and I you know
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:08.720]  it's it very much so right, but there's like
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:11.760]  Certain chess openings where it's like you already
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:16.240]  You know, you got to get like three moves in before you start making choices because it's like oh
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:18.960]  This is the whatever gambit and that's how you open
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:20.880]  um
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:24.640]  And if you know, you know that your your opening move is this
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:29.280]  That might be a surprise your opening move is a surprise, you know, and I think
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:38.000]  Fortnight sneaking in their own custom payment processing into an app. They'd submitted to apple a week before that didn't have it exposed
[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:40.400]  Definitely was a surprise
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:47.360]  Uh and epic clearly thought apple is almost certainly going to pull fortnite from the store in response
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:53.600]  That happened hours later and within minutes of that the lawsuit dropped and the video dropped
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:59.040]  Yeah, they had that move ready to go. So that's like you're playing white you make a surprising opening move
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:04.480]  Apple spends some time to think makes their move and a second they do you're like I knew it and then you have your move
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:07.360]  Ready to go and it's and they had a google lawsuit ready, too
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:10.800]  So i'm assuming they like so they must have figured that google would pull the app, too
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:14.320]  But they didn't have a video right there was no don't be evil video
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:17.200]  Right, right and you know, I think part of that is
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.320]  Apple's the juicier target. I mean, what would the google version of it be?
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:27.360]  But then why do the lost like so that that was the thing for me and we can get this later, too
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:32.080]  It's that it would almost have been worse for apple if they hadn't sued google immediately as well
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:37.360]  I wonder and I wonder if they thought you know
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:44.640]  if they thought to themselves maybe google would like to play both sides of this and they'll let
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:47.440]  They'll let fortnite slide, you know
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:53.680]  You know that maybe their epics thinking was maybe google would like to make hay at apple's expense, too
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:58.880]  I mean it at times google does right? I mean and you know, microsoft made
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:02.560]  Put out a pithy statement about the xbox game thing
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:08.400]  I mean, they're not above these big companies that play within our expectations of corporate decorum
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:12.000]  Aren't above taking jabs at each other
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:19.600]  So I think maybe they didn't know I didn't know I wasn't I felt very certain
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:22.160]  I would have bet a lot of money not my house
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:25.600]  But I would have bet a lot of money that apple was going to pull fortnite
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:30.320]  Same however crazy that seems given how popular it is. But what else could they do?
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:35.040]  I would not have bet so much on google. I would have made a much smaller bet on google
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:40.960]  And I think that that just you know, that that epic sort of okay. We'll file a lawsuit against you too. We kind of have to
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:47.680]  But they're they're everything they've done since has been less about google and more about apple
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:49.920]  Yeah, the curious thing to me though
[01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:51.920]  And it touches on a lot of the arguments people made
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:58.880]  Is and I think when a lot of these things happen a lot of the feelings that get expressed are more generic or more personal
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:02.000]  Or more personal and they sort of get attached to like epic
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:08.080]  So people who have had grudges or fundamental philosophical disagreements about the way the app store gets run
[01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:14.160]  Sort of voice those in support of epic regardless of whether they have anything to do with the specifics of epic or not
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:18.580]  And in this case, we saw a bunch of people saying like, you know, yes the app store is a monopoly
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:23.280]  Apple needs to open it up. They should allow side loading and the interesting thing to me is that
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:28.640]  uh epic shut that it should have effectively shut that down immediately because
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:36.640]  They had side loading on android. They used it. They hated it so much. They had to go back to the google play store
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:40.100]  And in their lawsuit, they argue that it's insufficient
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:46.640]  And people weren't familiar with it the way it works on android is basically like gatekeeper in that you have to go in turn it on
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:52.800]  To tap through a bunch of warning messages and then install the app and they said that that is enough
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:58.160]  To make sure that almost nobody ever uses it. So it's effectively not there anyway
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:03.200]  So when you argue that apple should just allow gatekeeper on the iphone that is an argument
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:08.640]  You know, I will make that argument too, but it is nothing that would make epic any happier than they are right now
[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:11.280]  well, I but I
[01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:12.480]  I think
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:16.960]  I I correct me if i'm wrong. I actually did the research on this and now i've already forgotten and of course
[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:19.040]  I don't have the notes. But um
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:28.640]  The way that epic did it wasn't that they pulled at fortnite from the play store they debuted android the android version of fortnite
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:30.880]  outside the play store
[01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:35.040]  And they tried to do it only on their own only through side loading
[01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:40.160]  And like a year later were like, uh, it didn't really work that well
[01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:42.660]  So here it is for the play store and now it complies
[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:48.240]  um, and it is still available outside the play store, so I actually went through on my
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:51.120]  pixel and
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:57.200]  Uh installed it and it's actually I this is actually I have to say I just hadn't been curious until this point
[01:52:57.280 --> 01:52:59.280]  How side loading worked on android?
[01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:01.860]  It is different than gatekeeper
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:04.800]  in a certain basic sense
[01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:10.880]  Where at least on the latest version of android, uh, I think it's android 10, whatever i'm running on my pixel
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:17.760]  That's up to pixel 4 that's up to date. It's not a system-wide thing where you say allow apps from other sources
[01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:21.520]  What you do is you pick apps that can?
[01:53:22.380 --> 01:53:23.920]  install
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:25.840]  uh apps
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:26.960]  to
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:29.520]  And they call them sources and it's a little
[01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:36.480]  Apk source it's confusing because you you're in so the way that you go about it is i'm in chrome
[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:42.800]  With the default browser on android and I go to the epic site and I say I want to get fortnite and they say okay
[01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:47.600]  Start by downloading the epic games store or I think that's what they call it
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:52.560]  And you download an apk file, which is like the dot app bundle for them
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:56.800]  um and chrome says do you want to allow
[01:53:56.800 --> 01:54:02.560]  App installations from this source, you know, it might might be dangerous blah blah blah
[01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:08.000]  I wasn't sure what that dialogue i'm not trying to be obtuse here. I I honestly didn't know what it meant
[01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:13.040]  Like do they mean the source is epic games.com or the source is
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:18.080]  Chrome the chrome app on my phone what they mean is the chrome app
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:24.560]  Um, that's the source and so what you do then there's like a security section in the
[01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:28.560]  It's android settings where you can say here are the sources you're allowed to install
[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:32.080]  Apps from and there it's a list of apps
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:39.840]  And so the path for getting fortnite on your android phone is first use your browser to get epic games
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:44.480]  And and first you have to allow your browser to install apps
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:52.240]  Then you can run epic games and you have to run through the same set of permission dialogues to let the epic game store install
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:54.800]  Apps because the epic game store is how you get fortnite
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:54:57.680]  so
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:01.280]  And there's no notarization requirement like there is for the standard gatekeeper
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:03.600]  Like you can turn off that requirement for gatekeeper, but there's no
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:06.720]  Signed or notarized as far as I know
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:11.840]  Uh for those android apps, yeah, maybe uh, here's the dialog box
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:18.000]  It says chrome for your security your phone is not allowed to install unknown apps from this source
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:21.600]  And then your two your two options are cancel or settings
[01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:27.780]  So again, I I think that that exact and and this is on i'm on the epic games.com
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:32.320]  Fortnite website and the dialog box just says chrome for your security
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:34.720]  Your phone is not allowed to install unknown apps from this source
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:39.200]  I don't think it was a bad guess for me to say that the source is epic games.com, but they mean
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:45.040]  Chrome, but if you just tap settings then you go through and it's a very clear dialogue
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:50.160]  The next screen is your it jumps you right to settings says chrome allow from this source
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:56.080]  It's off by default and it says your phone and personal data are more vulnerable to attack by unknown apps
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:02.240]  By installing apps from this source you agree that you are responsible for any damage to your phone or loss of data
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:04.320]  That may result from their use
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:08.400]  And then you can turn it on so I think there's a couple of things here number one
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:15.360]  I think epic's little a b test on what what is their success outside the play store?
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:20.720]  Is corrupted by the fact that they don't let you download fortnite directly anyway
[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:24.400]  They make you download epic games and then through epic games get fortnite, right?
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:26.560]  So it was on the samsung store as well
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:30.560]  But I think that also just shows us the marketing back to the samsung store versus google play
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:35.600]  Yeah, I definitely think so, uh, which is confusing too, right and it gets into the level of
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:38.160]  Okay, you have more choices more choices is good
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:43.360]  Well, not necessarily because if you have a samsung phone and you have access to the play store and the samsung store
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:45.600]  Where are you supposed to go?
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:49.200]  Well, it also goes beyond that like when people say android is open. Android is open to the vendors
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:53.120]  There's very little about android that's open to the end consumer unless you build it yourself from
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:58.560]  The open source project and very few human beings are capable of doing that to make a functional consumer phone
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:02.160]  And you for example, you can't get the l like if there was an lg store
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:09.040]  You couldn't get the lg store on on samsung or the samsung store on on one plus and that was part of their argument
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:13.920]  Was that google was sort of forcing one plus not to include the epic game launcher built-in
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:19.520]  Which would make it easier for customers and we're forcing lg not to include it which would make it easier for customers
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:26.320]  And I I don't think that these dialogue boxes are particularly
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:30.160]  Alarming in their language. I mean honestly i'm not trying to
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:34.800]  Be again, I keep saying i'm not trying to be obtuse, but i'm really not. I think that these are very reasonable
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:42.240]  Paths to turn on side loading. It's very difficult. You wouldn't happen by accident, which is important
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:49.600]  And I think correct and if we really want to get fortnite the path to do it is pretty obvious
[01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:57.520]  But it's epic's own fault that it is a two level first install the epic game store then install fortnite
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:01.040]  It's their own dumb ass fault. However, many people they've lost
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:08.960]  By not just allowing the fortnite dot apk to be downloaded directly from the web and only granting your web browser this
[01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:11.200]  Super ability to install apps
[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:15.360]  That's their own fault for putting their their desire to have an epic game store
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:21.520]  Ahead of making it as easy as possible to install fortnite. So if they've that's sort of like i'm
[01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:27.040]  Spoiler here, but that's why i'll get to later is that epic is not the batman we want or need here because their goal is
[01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:28.880]  Not to have you install
[01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:34.160]  Fortnite their goal is to get the epic store right on like they they're they're their problem is not so much
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:39.600]  They hate the app store and hate the google play store in in that they want to be an app store or a google play store
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:43.600]  They don't want to they don't want to give 30 of their income to apple or google
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:47.360]  They want to charge 12 percent or whatever it ends up being to other game developers
[01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:52.000]  All right, they want to be on the opposite side of that fence right and much like a lot of the stuff with
[01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:55.200]  President trump where it's like just listen to him, right?
[01:58:55.200 --> 01:59:01.360]  Like he literally said i'm i'm trying to keep the post office underfunded so they can't count the millions of ballots, you know
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:05.120]  And they're like, uh, you weren't supposed to say that out loud and he's like, oh, yeah, that's what i'm doing
[01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:07.760]  It's the same way where tim swinney has said
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:13.920]  Yes, just the other day. He even said like wouldn't it be great if you could buy once and
[01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:18.000]  Have the same game on your playstation and your switch and your phone
[01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:22.560]  And again, i'm not even disagreeing that from a user's perspective. That would be great
[01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:29.040]  It would be fantastic if you could buy a 60 app once and run it on two platforms and your phone with one purchase
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:33.040]  I agree from the consumer's perspective totally agree
[01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:37.840]  But what what is he talking about is the mechanism for that? He's talking about the epic store?
[01:59:38.480 --> 01:59:41.360]  I mean and his games, right? He's not fighting the game. He's not fighting the game
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:45.520]  I mean and his games, right? He's not fighting any other developers battles, but his own
[01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:48.560]  so
[01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:49.760]  So
[01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:52.080]  Google I i'm not surprised that they
[01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:54.720]  kicked fortnite off I
[01:59:55.760 --> 02:00:00.560]  Wouldn't have bet heavily on it. I can see why they're not making a big stink about it because
[02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:05.760]  It it the existence of android. I think this would be a lot easier on android
[02:00:05.760 --> 02:00:10.800]  If the play store were a lot more like the ios app store and had a lot more
[02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:12.400]  It's increasingly becoming like that though
[02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:17.680]  Like google has moved away from the open android model towards a far more controlled google play services model over the years
[02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:22.000]  And even with games they are far more controlling with games than they are with random software
[02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:29.200]  But there's an awful lot of people who are what they're saying. They want from ios at a user's perspective is
[02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:34.560]  Something like gatekeeper or what android calls. I don't even know if they have a name for it, but
[02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:41.440]  Something that would let you install apps by clicking, you know off by everybody. Oh, everybody reasonable agrees. It would be off by default
[02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:44.880]  Because it even is on the mac and everybody and yes
[02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:50.000]  There's some diehards on the issue who maybe would say that's somehow philosophically offensive
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:59.360]  Off by default easily turned on with a warning that is not that is truthful and not yes
[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:02.400]  unnecessarily alarming
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:09.280]  And therefore it would give you the user freedom to get things that either aren't allowed or otherwise are just optional through
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:11.600]  their platforms app store
[02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:16.640]  They have it on google, right? That's the so there's a part of this
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:23.040]  Thing where it's very uncomfortable for epic in my opinion to say well, what do you want apple to do?
[02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:29.440]  What could apple do to just say? Okay, you know what tim swinney and epic you're right. We're wrong
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:33.200]  You're right. We're wrong. Let's you know, we'll just
[02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:36.240]  Do whatever you want. What do you want us to do?
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:38.640]  And I think there's a lot of people
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:42.240]  uh on the ios side of the
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:46.560]  debate here who are saying that ios should be like android but they are
[02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:51.600]  That's obviously not the answer because they're they're suing google, too
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:55.360]  They want something more and if you read their lawsuit against google
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:58.320]  they complain
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:01:59.780]  vociferously
[02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:06.820]  That those warning dialogues that I just read are yes are the whole reason they were a failure outside the play for
[02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:09.220]  Play store and that they're unfair
[02:02:09.540 --> 02:02:11.540]  and overly alarming
[02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:17.060]  I I think they want like a one tap thing where all of a sudden there's an epic game store on your phone
[02:02:17.220 --> 02:02:20.180]  and that's it with no warning by default and
[02:02:21.220 --> 02:02:23.220]  That is a bad idea
[02:02:23.540 --> 02:02:27.860]  They want basically the epic game store to be on the app store on the google play store where you can tap it
[02:02:27.860 --> 02:02:30.820]  Install it and from then on you never have to go back to the app store the play store, right?
[02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:35.780]  And you know and then that the games installed by the epic game store or every bit, you know
[02:02:36.100 --> 02:02:40.420]  Native apps on the platform that are on your home screen etc and so forth
[02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:45.940]  And then when and because they run the epic game store very similar. So the epic game store people aren't familiar with it
[02:02:46.580 --> 02:02:52.340]  Um tim sweden gets angry at so many people he got angry at valve steam because they charge 30
[02:02:52.660 --> 02:02:56.580]  The industry standard is 30 you can love it or hate it, but it's the industry standard. Um,
[02:02:56.580 --> 02:03:02.340]  They were charging 30 and he didn't think he was getting value from that. So he made his own store and he's aggressive
[02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:05.640]  So he's tried to assign a lot of games to exclusive agreements
[02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:10.900]  That would keep them out of the steam store as a way to compete and he only charges 12
[02:03:11.620 --> 02:03:15.940]  He epic only charges 12 they do charge a licensing fee for the unreal engine
[02:03:15.940 --> 02:03:21.140]  But if you use the unreal engine inside the epic store you get that five percent back. So it's
[02:03:21.700 --> 02:03:25.540]  a little more complicated, but i'd also caution saying that
[02:03:25.540 --> 02:03:32.580]  He's delivering fundamentally less than what most like he's not delivering anywhere near the value that an app store or a play store is
[02:03:32.980 --> 02:03:35.780]  I'm, not sure compared to steam because he doesn't have the reach
[02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:40.900]  He doesn't he doesn't have the ability to feature games doesn't have the the scope of the of the user commitment to it
[02:03:41.220 --> 02:03:46.180]  But also that can change at any time. There's no law that says what a game store has to charge so
[02:03:47.060 --> 02:03:53.060]  He effectively just like people say it's david versus goliath, but it's it's a young hungry goliath who wants to be the goliath
[02:03:53.060 --> 02:03:58.500]  Uh, can I just say also as an aside that the epic game store for android that I did go ahead and install only has two
[02:03:58.500 --> 02:04:03.860]  Games, it has fortnite and battle breakers, which i've never heard of so they make you jump through the hoop of
[02:04:04.660 --> 02:04:07.540]  Installing their game store first before you can get fortnite
[02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:12.020]  Which is the thing everybody is surely going there this week for just to have the option to install one other game
[02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:15.460]  I mean for now, I think the windows I forget how many are on the windows version
[02:04:15.460 --> 02:04:19.780]  But they do have a bunch of apps that they're that they're effectively doing what the app store does. They're brokering those apps, right?
[02:04:19.780 --> 02:04:25.380]  Um, obviously with apple it's more of a fight obviously it is, you know, and it's a true
[02:04:25.380 --> 02:04:32.420]  it's a trojan horse not in the sense of being a you know, the the security industry term of a trojan horse, but in the
[02:04:32.980 --> 02:04:37.460]  allegorical sense of the the story of the the original trojan horse
[02:04:38.180 --> 02:04:40.660]  They built this functionality into fortnite
[02:04:41.220 --> 02:04:46.020]  Didn't have it enabled submitted the update got it approved and then turned it on right
[02:04:46.020 --> 02:04:51.460]  Now, um, you know, and in terms of apple not being as heavy-handed as they could be, you know
[02:04:51.460 --> 02:04:56.260]  They're allowing it to stay up at least through august 28th, I guess is their deadline
[02:04:57.140 --> 02:04:58.340]  Yeah
[02:04:58.340 --> 02:05:03.860]  And uh, if it sounds like you know, i'm being hard harder on it, you know, i'm not sure if it's going to be as heavy-handed
[02:05:03.860 --> 02:05:08.660]  But i'm not sure if it's going to be as heavy-handed as it could be. You know, i'm not sure if it's going to be as heavy-handed
[02:05:08.660 --> 02:05:10.660]  But i'm not sure if it's going to be as heavy-handed as it could be
[02:05:10.660 --> 02:05:16.980]  Yeah, and uh, if it sounds like you know, i'm being hard harder on epic than I am on apple
[02:05:17.220 --> 02:05:22.740]  That's only because epic won't stop talking if apple and google put out apples put out two statements google one statement
[02:05:23.300 --> 02:05:27.620]  Sweeney is tweeting and it's just it's so much easier when you have things that you can respond to
[02:05:28.340 --> 02:05:33.460]  Because I I you know, I think that there's much better ways that apple can handle this and I do think to your point earlier
[02:05:33.860 --> 02:05:38.500]  It's absolutely reckless that epic has a game engine attached to them
[02:05:38.500 --> 02:05:43.380]  this isn't like unity, which is a standalone engine and it's not like, uh, hey, which uh,
[02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:48.500]  You know base camp which has an app that that's not a framework that everyone depends on
[02:05:48.980 --> 02:05:52.500]  Uh and android isn't in this discussion because nobody creates
[02:05:53.140 --> 02:05:57.320]  Unreal games on android but on on apple's platforms
[02:05:57.860 --> 02:06:04.020]  They both apple and epic have developers who are dependent upon this relationship being mature and being managed
[02:06:04.020 --> 02:06:10.420]  And it's that's not what it is right now. And so my most of my usually all my sympathy is not with epic
[02:06:10.420 --> 02:06:13.940]  It's not with apple. It's with the indie devs, but here it's also with the people who are
[02:06:14.580 --> 02:06:17.860]  whose businesses depend on the unreal engine and right now are
[02:06:18.580 --> 02:06:23.860]  Nervous if not terrified about what's happening. Yeah, I it you know, and I looked into this. Um,
[02:06:24.500 --> 02:06:28.660]  There's not a lot of unreal engine games for ios
[02:06:28.660 --> 02:06:32.020]  I mean there have been some high profile ones including infinity blade which
[02:06:32.020 --> 02:06:38.340]  Was from epic and actually got them on stage at keynotes. Probably not going to be on stage at future keynotes for a while
[02:06:40.260 --> 02:06:41.780]  Um
[02:06:41.780 --> 02:06:44.040]  It's not that old gears award on microsoft
[02:06:44.900 --> 02:06:50.660]  but it is it even if you don't plan it on if you don't have direct plans for launching your
[02:06:51.300 --> 02:06:58.100]  uh in the works title for ios the fact that it's a possibility is certainly there right and
[02:06:58.100 --> 02:07:04.100]  Platforms that really need to be stable and predictable, you know, and you can say what you want
[02:07:04.580 --> 02:07:08.340]  And you know, that's a lot of what the predictability is
[02:07:08.980 --> 02:07:13.300]  You mentioned hey there that's a real issue with the app store
[02:07:14.100 --> 02:07:17.220]  Guidelines is and it makes the platform
[02:07:18.500 --> 02:07:24.340]  Unreliable right like yes. Um, and I do I think this is so funny that
[02:07:24.340 --> 02:07:27.220]  when hey
[02:07:27.220 --> 02:07:29.220]  launched and apple
[02:07:29.540 --> 02:07:35.140]  Initially let the first version through and then the second version before they officially launched they were like
[02:07:35.460 --> 02:07:39.540]  Oh, you need to implement in-app purchasing. This isn't in compliance
[02:07:40.340 --> 02:07:41.620]  and
[02:07:41.620 --> 02:07:44.420]  Rather than sit there and stew quietly
[02:07:46.100 --> 02:07:51.300]  Jason fried and david hannemeyer hanson collectively, you know went public with it
[02:07:51.300 --> 02:07:55.620]  In a very effective way, right? They're very he doesn't do anything quietly
[02:07:55.860 --> 02:08:01.460]  No, he doesn't you know and they're such a good duo because there's sort of a it's not good cop bad cop
[02:08:01.460 --> 02:08:03.460]  But like loud cop quiet cop
[02:08:04.260 --> 02:08:06.260]  right dramatic and dramatic
[02:08:07.300 --> 02:08:14.980]  uh, but it was a very effective campaign and so many people accused them of engineering the whole thing as a stunt for
[02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:16.420]  publicity
[02:08:16.420 --> 02:08:23.700]  And you know and dhs in particular is like that's insane. How in the world would we possibly have predicted that?
[02:08:23.860 --> 02:08:31.300]  You know, but all people saw was that oh you're getting a lot of publicity public sentiment is almost entirely on your side
[02:08:32.260 --> 02:08:37.940]  Uh, therefore this was all a publicity stunt. Whereas they're like no we really just wanted the damn app in the store
[02:08:38.100 --> 02:08:44.020]  The launch wasn't the stunt the really the the litigation about the blockage was like they have a very prominent article on it
[02:08:44.020 --> 02:08:50.100]  Their website that talks about the value of rage, uh in in getting your opinion across online
[02:08:50.740 --> 02:08:55.060]  And they are very effective at once something happens that they don't think is right and proper
[02:08:55.700 --> 02:09:02.100]  Of marshaling that sort of internet rage in their direction to help them get what they want, right? And that's just good clean
[02:09:02.100 --> 02:09:09.460]  Yes advocacy for yourself, you know, and it shows that however disproportionate the financial might of apple versus
[02:09:09.460 --> 02:09:15.720]  The base camp company llc is in terms of righteous indignation and publicity
[02:09:16.180 --> 02:09:18.900]  You can fight them on equal grounds, right?
[02:09:18.900 --> 02:09:20.580]  That's it's a fascinating story
[02:09:20.580 --> 02:09:27.460]  but these these people who accused them of a stunt and and their story their their side of the argument is we thought hey was
[02:09:27.460 --> 02:09:31.860]  A lot like base camp and we've been doing this with base camp on ios for 12 years
[02:09:31.860 --> 02:09:35.220]  So we just and and our first 1.0 went through
[02:09:35.220 --> 02:09:42.340]  And that's all true. It's exactly what they thought developer who's not doing something outlandish should ever have to worry about whether their app
[02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:49.940]  Gets on the store or not. Whereas what epic is done with fortnite literally is a publicity stunt. Yes. They had a publicity stunt
[02:09:50.740 --> 02:09:55.780]  Uh video ready to go and they deliberately epic deliberately
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:00.580]  Violated the clear rules of the store and they knew it
[02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:04.500]  I mean they they they admit it. Nobody's in denial of it fortnite says oh, yeah
[02:10:04.500 --> 02:10:10.180]  We we put a feature in our app for the app store that completely violates one of the core rules
[02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:13.220]  Not like an easel apple and google's app store, right?
[02:10:13.220 --> 02:10:19.080]  A rule that everybody is aware of and talks about all the time not like oh you never knew about rule 29
[02:10:19.780 --> 02:10:21.780]  D section f oh
[02:10:22.820 --> 02:10:26.820]  I didn't know. Yeah. No, this is like, you know rule it might be rule 29
[02:10:26.820 --> 02:10:31.300]  I didn't know. Yeah. No, this is like, you know rule it might be rule 3.3
[02:10:31.300 --> 02:10:35.380]  But it might as well be rule one, which is that if you do online, you know
[02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:43.460]  Ones and zero digital content transactions they go through apple and you pay apple thou shalt put no payment system before me, right?
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:45.540]  exactly, um
[02:10:45.540 --> 02:10:46.500]  but
[02:10:46.500 --> 02:10:48.500]  in terms of predictability that
[02:10:49.380 --> 02:10:51.380]  What happened with hay?
[02:10:51.460 --> 02:10:55.700]  Gets to actual problems honest indie
[02:10:55.700 --> 02:11:02.920]  developers large and small have with the app store is that it's not predictable and look I I think it ties in with
[02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:10.000]  Microsoft and the xbox game pass is that I think they thought they were going to be able to work this out by writing a
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:13.800]  Check effectively. Let's just figure out what percentage you want and we'll agree to it
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:19.160]  And when apple was like, no, this is actually about solving, you know control of the platform going forward not money
[02:11:19.960 --> 02:11:23.480]  It was unpredictable and that makes weird. That's a problem
[02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:27.080]  That's a problem. No, it totally there's this weird thing inside apple
[02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:32.440]  And I don't know why it exists this way where they would they prefer not to say no to an app up front
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:38.760]  But when they find something they don't like they want to make an example out of a very public app immediately as a way of setting
[02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:42.040]  policy, they don't have to write down and I think that
[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:50.200]  I think maybe that is a lot of legal legal ass covering or it's a way of they see it as a way of maintaining flexibility
[02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:52.440]  but I think it's absolutely detrimental to
[02:11:52.440 --> 02:11:56.920]  To uh developer confidence in the platform and I really wish they wouldn't do that. It just
[02:11:57.640 --> 02:12:01.340]  It it takes their most ardent supporter and turns them into a disgruntled
[02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:06.680]  Angry individual and there's just no reason for it, right? I think in terms of sort of un
[02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:10.200]  Breaking free of some of the I don't know. What are they barnacles?
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:14.280]  You know things that are stuck the way that the argument has sort of gotten rusty
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:17.320]  And we're sort of making the same arguments over and over again
[02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:23.420]  And if you really just want to let's break let's break this off snap this off and find a new perspective
[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:30.300]  Like one of the ways apple could like let's rethink the app store is how can we make this a lot more predictable?
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.660]  now and
[02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:34.660]  anticipating future trends
[02:12:35.160 --> 02:12:38.620]  um, I I think that the whole reader app category
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:43.800]  is unpredictable because it's it's it's clearly what they're
[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:47.640]  They're just the plain terminology calling netflix a reader app
[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:54.520]  You know, it's it just speaks to the fact that the rule is ambiguous in terms of what qualifies and what doesn't you know?
[02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:57.080]  And if you want to say games definitely don't qualify
[02:12:57.640 --> 02:13:01.880]  Games are one of those things like pornography where there's a I know it when I see it, right?
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:08.600]  It's you know, you can say games and people know what games are right bandersnatch is game like video
[02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:11.400]  But everybody knows it's not a game. Yeah, um
[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:13.400]  So
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:15.720]  I I think that that unpredictability
[02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:21.880]  I don't think in terms of what chess moves one side or the other may or may not have anticipated or predicted
[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:28.120]  I'm, not entirely sure epic foresaw apple saying we're going to sever your apple developer agreement
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:34.520]  Maybe they did maybe they didn't but this is the thing and like you pointed it out. This is what puts unreal engine at risk
[02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:36.600]  um
[02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:42.920]  Because it has nothing to do with ios. It's because they develop it using max so that it can run on
[02:13:43.540 --> 02:13:45.160]  ios
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:48.280]  um, you know, presumably, uh, you know the pc development where
[02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:53.480]  It's bread and butter of the unreal target audience of games are isn't done on a mac
[02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:57.400]  But they need to be able to do the development on a mac to keep it compiling
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:00.360]  Even if you don't even count the mac as a target
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:02.920]  it's um
[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:08.600]  Although that's probably less relevant as time goes on and apple and max move to apple silicon that the mac will
[02:14:09.160 --> 02:14:14.120]  As a byproduct of being more architecturally similar to ios, but that's neither here nor there
[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:16.120]  But if they want it to run on ios
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:21.160]  They need to compile it on a mac and if they need to compile it on a mac, they need an apple developer license
[02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:23.000]  and
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:24.520]  it's
[02:14:24.520 --> 02:14:25.860]  you know
[02:14:25.860 --> 02:14:31.320]  Technically, yeah, they could just say well, you know renee they could let you side load it. I mean, yeah
[02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:38.440]  Yeah, they hate that whole idea or they could register a new apple developer license agreement and it's somebody else's name
[02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:42.360]  You know the you know, the renee richie, you know personal thing
[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:44.920]  But that's that's actually against the rules
[02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:49.800]  If you want to say we're sticking to rules and we're looking at these and we have lawyers involved the license agreement
[02:14:49.880 --> 02:14:54.280]  Also says that if you're a company you can't play shenanigans by registering
[02:14:54.900 --> 02:14:56.440]  developer license, you know
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:15:02.600]  If they can make a subsidiary and license the engine to themselves in perpetuity and have a developer account for the subsidiary
[02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:06.520]  There's all sorts of legal shenanigans, right? There's all sorts of stuff they could do but in the meantime
[02:15:07.060 --> 02:15:09.060]  basically, they put
[02:15:09.160 --> 02:15:16.360]  Unreal engine as a platform for targeting ios at risk for a fight that has nothing to do with unreal engine specifically at all
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:17.480]  Yeah
[02:15:17.480 --> 02:15:19.480]  And that is not a good move
[02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:21.800]  as a platform vendor
[02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:25.960]  And it should have been predictable because that is exactly what the other clause in the app store thing says
[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:28.280]  I mean like maybe they would have thought that apple wouldn't enforce it
[02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:33.080]  But they had to know that it was a possibility because it is in that same agreement that they signed, right?
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:36.760]  So what should apple have done in response to fortnite doing this, right?
[02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:39.160]  that's if we're going to wrap up the show and
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:45.400]  And I think that there's a sentiment that i've seen from a lot of people and I think it's reasonable which is that apple
[02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:53.080]  threatening to pull epics entire developer license and therefore, uh putting unreal engine at risk too
[02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:57.320]  Is heavy-handed and uncalled for and a bullying tactic
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:03.560]  um, I could preface this quickly by saying like there's a lot of things I think people look at as individuals and not as companies
[02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:05.720]  and we saw that like a week or so ago when
[02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:10.280]  Apple is suing this company that has a pear-shaped logo and everyone's like, oh look apple is evil
[02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:14.520]  But the law literally says if you don't defend trademarks you lose them
[02:16:14.680 --> 02:16:19.320]  I mean there's things that happen as a company that are morally, you know, I don't say reprehensible
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:23.160]  But you know, they no sane person would do them but because of the way laws are written
[02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:28.840]  And if they don't enforce the app store agreement as written, uh, I mean they obviously have discretion
[02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:33.480]  but if they don't enforce it as written it becomes very hard to enforce it the next time when maybe it is
[02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:38.440]  and like maybe they catch a new social network literally stealing everyone's data and they want to pull their license and
[02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:42.760]  The lawsuit says well you didn't pull epics license. So why are you going to pull ours? This is obviously
[02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:48.120]  Not fair dealing so you have to always look at these things in terms of companies not individuals, right?
[02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:51.560]  And the pear-shaped licensed one is maybe a good example
[02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:55.880]  Actually, it's maybe it's a bad example and that's what makes it a good example where the logo really isn't
[02:16:56.120 --> 02:17:01.800]  Confused with the apple logo at all, right? Like the way I say it is it would be a problem if a company
[02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:05.080]  Said to their designer, okay
[02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:10.920]  We want a pear logo make it look like the apple logo, but a pear instead of an apple
[02:17:11.480 --> 02:17:14.600]  And there's different ways you can interpret that basic art direction
[02:17:14.600 --> 02:17:19.320]  But however, it came out if they did a good job, you could say well, that's something apple needs to sue to defend
[02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:24.120]  The logo we're talking about with this pear company is not that at all. It does not
[02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:26.360]  so
[02:17:26.360 --> 02:17:32.920]  Looking at the two logos. I think most reasonable people including me would say apple didn't need to go after this company, but
[02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:41.480]  You can see how somebody in apple legal who's looking after their interests in their job and the company's interests would say
[02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:47.880]  Anything even vaguely involved with computers and a piece of fruit and a leaf on top. We're going to say you can't do it
[02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:55.240]  I disagree, but it's not like out of left field, right? It's not like it's not even that like it's it's not like they're suing them
[02:17:55.240 --> 02:17:59.480]  They're just filing an objection and the person who gets the objection will just say no you're out of your minds
[02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:06.920]  But you did because they filed the objection, right? Um, whereas with this with the the guidelines that's you know
[02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:13.400]  The guidelines that's you know, your your way, you know, whoever filed that for apple legal is way out on the edge of protecting
[02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:15.640]  their apple logo trademark
[02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:21.080]  Apple's saying we're going to remove your we're going to cut you off from the apple developer program
[02:18:21.640 --> 02:18:27.240]  Is again, it's not an obscure violation. It is a direct assault on the nature of it
[02:18:27.800 --> 02:18:30.440]  And if they want to be able to do that for other reasons
[02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:34.520]  I think that they might have to do it here and if they didn't do it like what else could they do?
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:38.520]  What else could apple do in the interim while this lawsuit is being?
[02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:41.320]  fought and I will say
[02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:47.240]  By all accounts both sides. There is no indication that epic needs to
[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:54.440]  Drop their lawsuit apple isn't saying you have to drop your lawsuit or else we're not letting you
[02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000]  You were canceling your developer agreement
[02:18:57.160 --> 02:19:00.840]  They're all apple is saying that they have to do is submit a new version of fortnite that
[02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:05.080]  Complys with the guidelines meaning takes out their payment processing and all's good
[02:19:05.720 --> 02:19:10.520]  Meaning all's good. You can continue with your lawsuit. You can sue apple and be in the app store
[02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:13.320]  So it's they're not that spiteful, right?
[02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:20.440]  What else could apple do if they don't threaten to take the the developer licensing way? I guess what they could do is
[02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:22.120]  just
[02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:28.040]  Get not just take fortnite out of the store, but make fortnite stop working on installed devices
[02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:34.040]  Such just fortnite instead of the license overall. I mean, yeah
[02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:37.640]  But does that mean then that they take away, you know
[02:19:37.720 --> 02:19:43.800]  That's I think where you're going is does that mean that in future cases with other companies where they really want to take away
[02:19:44.520 --> 02:19:51.000]  Their developer license agreement does it set a bad precedent where the company can say? Well the last time they just kicked the app out
[02:19:51.720 --> 02:19:55.560]  Yeah, I mean precedent is everything that's why like like i'm i'm not saying the pair thing wasn't ridiculous
[02:19:55.560 --> 02:20:01.480]  It was but it's pro forma. It's like and i'm not saying this is a huge threat to the business, but it
[02:20:02.280 --> 02:20:07.320]  Everything is based on precedent and if it says in the agreement, this is what happens 28 days after you do that
[02:20:07.720 --> 02:20:09.720]  This is what happens 28 days after you do that
[02:20:09.800 --> 02:20:11.800]  And if you start not doing those things as a company
[02:20:12.040 --> 02:20:16.360]  You're setting a precedent that in in who who knows what egregious case comes up next
[02:20:16.600 --> 02:20:20.120]  It gets litigated saying well your honor, they didn't do it in these three other cases. Why are they doing it?
[02:20:20.120 --> 02:20:24.620]  Now they're being punitive right and it gets to the nature of the word anti-competitive
[02:20:24.620 --> 02:20:26.620]  competitive which is weird
[02:20:26.780 --> 02:20:27.980]  uh
[02:20:27.980 --> 02:20:33.660]  Ben thompson's been mentioning lately that the the last the case with qualcomm brings up the term the difference between
[02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:38.240]  Anti-competitive and hyper competitive which is interesting. But the thing about anti-competitive
[02:20:39.180 --> 02:20:41.180]  Is that in a lot of sense?
[02:20:41.580 --> 02:20:46.800]  When whenever we bring up anti-competitive what you're really also talking about is just being competitive
[02:20:47.180 --> 02:20:51.260]  Yeah, you know anti-competitive behavior and competitive behavior
[02:20:51.260 --> 02:20:59.200]  Is often the same thing right and it's not really anti-meaning the opposite like anti-competitive is sort of like socialist communist
[02:20:59.580 --> 02:21:01.580]  Everybody, you know
[02:21:01.580 --> 02:21:06.540]  You know everybody hold hands and share collectively in the common good for everybody, right?
[02:21:07.180 --> 02:21:13.420]  Or you're a legal monopoly like some cable companies are where you you give up some form of regulation and in exchange for owning a market
[02:21:13.660 --> 02:21:20.140]  Right anti-matter and matter just cancel each other out anti-competition and competition aren't opposites really
[02:21:20.140 --> 02:21:23.340]  Um, and so what are you if you're saying that apple shouldn't
[02:21:24.060 --> 02:21:30.060]  Shouldn't yank or put the kill switch on fortnite and disable fortnite on all the phones that are out there
[02:21:30.620 --> 02:21:36.860]  And they shouldn't revoke their developer cert. Well, then what what should they do? There's nothing there is nothing left what they just sit and
[02:21:36.860 --> 02:21:38.860]  Take it and let fortnite
[02:21:39.180 --> 02:21:41.180]  completely flagrantly violate
[02:21:41.740 --> 02:21:47.580]  the terms of the agreement for and then when the next app does does it what can they do then because they just said they're
[02:21:47.580 --> 02:21:51.820]  What can they do then because they just said they're not going to do anything when force knight did it so like every game like
[02:21:52.460 --> 02:21:57.100]  Like the company that owns farm like facebook owns farmville and the company that owns candy crush king. I think it is
[02:21:57.660 --> 02:21:59.740]  They will just switch to the same thing immediately
[02:22:00.460 --> 02:22:01.660]  well
[02:22:01.660 --> 02:22:03.660]  would they I don't know because
[02:22:03.740 --> 02:22:09.020]  You know then the lawsuit gets settled and it's settled in apple's favor and all of a sudden there's a reckoning for all of these
[02:22:09.100 --> 02:22:13.180]  Yeah, I know I guess yeah. No fair point. But I mean, it's like it's it's hard to have someone
[02:22:13.260 --> 02:22:15.580]  It's basically it's occupy wall street for the app store at that point
[02:22:15.580 --> 02:22:20.860]  Yeah, but anybody who does want to take their chances the way epic is it would certainly be free game for it
[02:22:20.860 --> 02:22:24.140]  So, I don't know. I don't think it's uncalled for for apple to do it
[02:22:24.140 --> 02:22:27.740]  I think it's actually just shows how reckless it was in the first place for epic
[02:22:28.300 --> 02:22:31.980]  To wage the battle this way. They certainly could have they could have pulled fortnite, right?
[02:22:31.980 --> 02:22:33.260]  Like they could have done that instead
[02:22:33.260 --> 02:22:37.740]  They could have just said we're not going to put fortnite on ios devices until apple changes their policy
[02:22:37.740 --> 02:22:41.980]  And if you're upset about that, here's apple's communication numbers, right? Well or
[02:22:41.980 --> 02:22:44.940]  The the far less dramatic. Well
[02:22:45.740 --> 02:22:49.340]  all right, so they could have pulled it and then that disrupts all of the
[02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:54.620]  customers the mutual customers of fortnite and ios
[02:22:55.340 --> 02:22:56.380]  which again
[02:22:56.380 --> 02:23:03.020]  I don't want to lose them in your in my discussion of this right like apple and epic and the courts can sort of
[02:23:03.820 --> 02:23:07.500]  Omit them as best they can or use them as pawns to only make their side of the argument
[02:23:07.500 --> 02:23:13.260]  But let's just face it, you know people who like playing fortnite on their devices should get to keep playing fortnite
[02:23:13.340 --> 02:23:18.780]  And right now they are they get to keep playing fortnite and it is still hosted in the app store
[02:23:19.340 --> 02:23:21.340]  yeah, so if you
[02:23:21.340 --> 02:23:25.820]  Reset your iphone or get a new iphone and need to redownload fortnite. It's there
[02:23:26.220 --> 02:23:27.580]  I got it on my phone
[02:23:27.580 --> 02:23:32.540]  Even though I never had it because my son had it and we have family sharing and so I could go to the app store
[02:23:33.420 --> 02:23:35.420]  uh purchased
[02:23:35.420 --> 02:23:39.420]  A family member jonas and then find fortnite and I got it
[02:23:39.660 --> 02:23:43.100]  so it is still there and include and it's the version that has the
[02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:46.240]  You know against the rules payment processing
[02:23:47.100 --> 02:23:49.100]  um
[02:23:50.140 --> 02:23:56.940]  It's hard to make the anti-competitive argument specifically with games because uh, you know people will say there's no choice but
[02:23:57.500 --> 02:24:01.500]  Games are games. We we were making that point earlier. You can play fortnite on android
[02:24:01.500 --> 02:24:04.460]  You can play it on xbox. You can play it on playstation. You can play it on switch
[02:24:04.460 --> 02:24:07.980]  there are several markets available to
[02:24:08.620 --> 02:24:13.260]  To uh epic for selling fortnite. They don't and then one of the best ways to
[02:24:13.820 --> 02:24:16.780]  Again, it does hurt the customers who want to play specifically on ios
[02:24:16.940 --> 02:24:19.980]  But in a traditional market if you're not happy with the terms of one store
[02:24:20.380 --> 02:24:25.420]  You go to the other stores and hopefully like that's what apple did with verizon verizon wasn't happy with their terms
[02:24:25.580 --> 02:24:29.660]  They sold so many phones on at&t verizon came begging for an iphone, right?
[02:24:29.660 --> 02:24:35.260]  Uh, and again, that's competition, you know, and again, I i'll make the point I would go on the aside
[02:24:35.820 --> 02:24:37.340]  there is this the sense that
[02:24:38.060 --> 02:24:43.580]  The xbox game pass thing is anti-competitive on apple's part because it uh is
[02:24:44.780 --> 02:24:45.740]  blocking
[02:24:45.740 --> 02:24:51.340]  Microsoft from doing this thing that microsoft wants to provide and that a lot of ios users want to use
[02:24:51.580 --> 02:24:57.260]  But in another sense, it's extremely competitive because now if you care about playing xbox game pass
[02:24:57.260 --> 02:25:02.220]  Games on your phone. There's a huge new competitive reason to buy an android phone instead of an iphone
[02:25:02.780 --> 02:25:04.780]  So in a sense, it's competitive
[02:25:05.500 --> 02:25:13.020]  um, absolutely, but in terms of blaming me ultimately blaming epic for the putting unreal engine at risk and not
[02:25:13.100 --> 02:25:20.300]  Blaming apple for saying that come august 28th. If you haven't fixed this we're going to cancel sever your your developer account
[02:25:20.860 --> 02:25:24.780]  They're the ones who decided to open this by flagrantly
[02:25:24.780 --> 02:25:30.300]  Violating the rules of the store with a trojan horse implementation of the feature
[02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:35.360]  The way that they could have done this and had the same lawsuit
[02:25:36.060 --> 02:25:41.260]  Is submit the app on the up and up with that feature fully exposed
[02:25:41.820 --> 02:25:44.700]  Have app store tap through and say whoa
[02:25:45.260 --> 02:25:49.660]  This is against the rules. No, no way you I don't know what you were thinking
[02:25:49.660 --> 02:25:52.720]  You cannot put your own payment in here as an alternative
[02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:54.720]  It's rejected
[02:25:54.720 --> 02:25:57.920]  File the lawsuit because the app was rejected
[02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:04.160]  And there you go. You've got your lawsuit you you submitted the app with the feature
[02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:08.000]  On the on its face so the apple could see it they rejected it
[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:15.520]  You can make your case publicly that this would have allowed them to pass 20 or 30 savings on to the you know users
[02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:19.280]  and apple would have no grounds to
[02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:24.800]  Cancel their developer license agreement. Not only I don't think apple would do it
[02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:28.880]  They did I don't believe there'd be any grounds for them to do it according to the terms
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:35.440]  It's all epics own doing they gave apple the ability to do it. So I think that the people who think apple is being
[02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:39.440]  A bully in this regard. Well, it's epic
[02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:44.560]  Who's the one who started it by doing something that they knew would open the door to it?
[02:26:44.560 --> 02:26:50.880]  And it it's reckless reckless behavior as the platform
[02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:53.760]  provider for unreal engine
[02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:58.080]  yeah, and I think that goes to a lot of the motivation behind this because I think it really was
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:05.440]  Really well planned like people have asked why they're not suing xbox or playstation or switch because again 30 is the industry standard
[02:27:06.080 --> 02:27:11.760]  And you can say like tim swinney will say it's because he believes that those platforms sell
[02:27:11.760 --> 02:27:18.900]  Sell hardware at cost or a loss and also do better partnering deals with big studios. So they better earn their 30%
[02:27:19.620 --> 02:27:23.140]  And again, that's that's something that people can rightfully argue about
[02:27:23.940 --> 02:27:30.260]  Also, sony owns 1.4% of epic 10 cent owns 40% of epic and 10 cent wants their own stores as well
[02:27:30.820 --> 02:27:35.540]  Microsoft, um, they made up famously and nintendo licenses the unreal engines
[02:27:35.540 --> 02:27:38.980]  They don't have a normal developer platform relationship with nintendo
[02:27:38.980 --> 02:27:45.060]  But beyond that I think they know that under current us law and I don't know about the eu but under current us law
[02:27:45.060 --> 02:27:50.580]  They would probably lose because there's no duty to deal you it's very hard to force a company
[02:27:51.780 --> 02:27:57.460]  To to do business that they don't want to do so they would probably law lose a lawsuit under the current laws
[02:27:58.020 --> 02:28:04.340]  But there is so much scrutiny, you know, tim cook and sundar pachai and everybody just testified in front of congress
[02:28:04.340 --> 02:28:11.220]  And there's so much uh momentum towards the regulation the breakup the the involvement in the tech industry
[02:28:11.860 --> 02:28:12.900]  that
[02:28:12.900 --> 02:28:20.100]  If you wanted a story to slap down in front of congress that would hurt apple and probably help you
[02:28:20.660 --> 02:28:24.740]  This is sort of like I always try to look at the end result and then reverse engineer how I get there
[02:28:25.060 --> 02:28:31.060]  And that to me seems like what epic wants out of this is to change the game enough that they can become part of it
[02:28:31.060 --> 02:28:34.100]  And I think from that lens, this is a good strategy for them
[02:28:34.900 --> 02:28:39.140]  Uh, I don't know. I i'm not sure I think it is good and if in
[02:28:39.780 --> 02:28:44.020]  In broad terms are you saying that in terms of they're battling this out in the court of public opinion?
[02:28:44.500 --> 02:28:50.760]  Yeah, I think also yeah, I think because I don't think they'd win a lawsuit but I think that they that they're creating a huge controversy
[02:28:51.300 --> 02:28:58.740]  That plays into the idea that people who are technologically illiterate will eventually be able to regulate companies like apple
[02:28:58.740 --> 02:29:03.060]  Yeah, and I think that one of the things that sort of gets lost and again
[02:29:03.060 --> 02:29:05.060]  I don't want to teach a high school civics course
[02:29:05.620 --> 02:29:12.020]  but you know the judicial branch of the government is a lot less political than
[02:29:12.580 --> 02:29:17.220]  Again, and it's very political but it's less political than the legislative branch
[02:29:17.860 --> 02:29:19.860]  Who are literally elected politicians?
[02:29:20.740 --> 02:29:21.860]  and
[02:29:21.860 --> 02:29:27.220]  The court of public opinion doesn't hold any sway in a court of law, right?
[02:29:27.220 --> 02:29:34.180]  Like if you don't have the law you got nothing to argue about when you're doing you're arguing, you know this case legally
[02:29:34.820 --> 02:29:35.860]  um
[02:29:35.860 --> 02:29:38.580]  When you're arguing there's no jury to nullify in these kind of courses
[02:29:38.580 --> 02:29:41.380]  It's literally like a judge sitting there looking at you, right?
[02:29:41.380 --> 02:29:48.260]  But when you're arguing before congress the way things should be holds a lot of sway because what congress can do is write laws
[02:29:48.900 --> 02:29:54.260]  The way they should be right the you know, and again, it's yeah, we're out of a whole discussion that yeah
[02:29:54.260 --> 02:30:00.020]  Well, there's certain judges have certain perspectives and they interpret laws in different ways. And yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's not you can't remove
[02:30:00.100 --> 02:30:05.220]  it's not absolute that congress is completely political and the judicial branch is not but
[02:30:06.100 --> 02:30:08.820]  The court of public opinion arguments definitely have more sway
[02:30:09.540 --> 02:30:10.400]  when
[02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:13.540]  Legislators and regulators are involved not judges. Um
[02:30:15.300 --> 02:30:22.420]  Where do you think it's going I I think i'm a little surprised it hasn't happened yet, but I expect I expect fortnite to
[02:30:22.420 --> 02:30:26.580]  Have an update that removes the the thing they'll say
[02:30:26.980 --> 02:30:33.300]  Epic will say look what mean apple the monopolist forced us to do and now everybody on ios has to pay
[02:30:33.540 --> 02:30:37.140]  The higher prices for v bucks which again aren't legal arguments at all
[02:30:37.460 --> 02:30:43.620]  They're completely court of public opinion arguments, but they're good ones. You know, they work they certainly work for fortnite players. Um
[02:30:45.700 --> 02:30:47.700]  But that they'll do that and then
[02:30:47.700 --> 02:30:52.660]  For for fortnite players who aren't paying attention. The only way they even knew about it
[02:30:52.740 --> 02:30:57.780]  Is that they maybe they saw the video when they launched fortnite because I don't know if anybody else knows that but I did
[02:30:58.020 --> 02:31:04.420]  I found it amusing that 1984 style video actually is like the startup video now when you launch fortnite
[02:31:05.540 --> 02:31:11.780]  Yeah, they they made it in game and they're they wanted to they wanted to weaponize the fortnite audience against apple
[02:31:12.020 --> 02:31:15.780]  Well, they but they show it they even show it on all the other platforms
[02:31:15.780 --> 02:31:19.780]  I didn't try it on the other I tried it on switch and I tried it on android and you see it
[02:31:19.780 --> 02:31:25.780]  They had an in-game debut for it as well. Yeah, it's it's in. Yeah, it's in game in on switch and android
[02:31:26.260 --> 02:31:30.340]  An anti-apple message. It's almost like they have monopoly control over the fortnite market
[02:31:31.220 --> 02:31:33.220]  I found it amusing
[02:31:33.220 --> 02:31:34.420]  um
[02:31:34.420 --> 02:31:37.060]  I don't know where it's going to end up. I don't know
[02:31:37.380 --> 02:31:40.820]  um, but I do think the other point i'll point out though is I think that
[02:31:40.820 --> 02:31:48.100]  Okay, they they picked their targets. They picked google and apple and I think they are juicier public court of public opinion targets
[02:31:48.100 --> 02:31:50.100]  but if they were to win
[02:31:50.260 --> 02:31:55.380]  And you never know how these things will turn out in court, right? Look at qualcomm which had like a terrible, you know
[02:31:56.100 --> 02:31:58.980]  Uh, you know like you're an anti-competitive monopolist who broke the law
[02:31:59.140 --> 02:32:03.940]  They appealed and the appeal was like three to zero who said no. Nope. That's all wrong, right? So
[02:32:04.740 --> 02:32:05.860]  You know, I don't know
[02:32:05.860 --> 02:32:12.820]  I don't know skipping the argument one of the fascinating things is those qualcomm lawyers who almost always fight against antitrust are now fighting for it
[02:32:13.300 --> 02:32:17.700]  They're the same lawyers that epic hired to fight for it for them if this goes to a judge
[02:32:17.780 --> 02:32:23.700]  You don't know how it's going to turn out. Um, but if it turns out more in epics favor than apples
[02:32:24.020 --> 02:32:24.580]  uh
[02:32:24.580 --> 02:32:29.940]  I I would be shocked if they don't epic doesn't turn around and then use it against
[02:32:29.940 --> 02:32:37.460]  Xbox playstation and nintendo not maybe not in a quite the same way because as you mentioned they have partnerships with those companies
[02:32:37.700 --> 02:32:38.580]  but
[02:32:38.580 --> 02:32:44.820]  It gives you know, uh, I think in terms of getting trying to get the epic play store on those platforms
[02:32:45.140 --> 02:32:51.140]  They're definitely going to use it if they win some kind of everything came up millhouse epic judgment
[02:32:51.460 --> 02:32:57.300]  Why wouldn't they right they can say screw our previous arrangement screw your 1.4 ownership of our company
[02:32:57.300 --> 02:33:02.740]  We want the epic store on playstation 5 and you have to do it because here's the here's the law. Here's our president
[02:33:02.740 --> 02:33:05.140]  Here's our president. I think it was interesting to me is um
[02:33:05.540 --> 02:33:09.940]  I did a community poll on my youtube channel because I wanted five options and twitter only allows
[02:33:10.500 --> 02:33:15.700]  For four because I wanted like I think apple's right. I think epic's right. I think they both have points figured out
[02:33:15.940 --> 02:33:20.580]  I think they're both dumb just stop it. And also honestly, I have way bigger problems in 2020 than this
[02:33:21.540 --> 02:33:25.540]  And people would assume that my audience is super pro apple, but with the microsoft
[02:33:25.540 --> 02:33:28.820]  Xbox streaming some people did say, you know, it's apple store
[02:33:28.820 --> 02:33:29.700]  They can do what they want
[02:33:29.700 --> 02:33:33.780]  But almost everybody thought that apple was being stupid and wrong about it like it wasn't even close
[02:33:34.020 --> 02:33:39.140]  Nobody's affinity for apple stopped them from thinking that it wasn't dumb for apple to block xbox streaming
[02:33:39.540 --> 02:33:45.300]  But here like 40 41 percent of people on apple side 18 on epics 17 think that they're both right
[02:33:45.460 --> 02:33:50.260]  They're three percent think they're both wrong and 20 think they're way bigger problems in the world right now
[02:33:50.260 --> 02:33:55.060]  So it's like it's one of those things where I think epic had a good initial strategy
[02:33:55.060 --> 02:34:00.740]  But they made some mistakes along the way that took away the momentum. Like I think the google lawsuit was one of those mistakes
[02:34:01.300 --> 02:34:06.020]  And just uh them tweeting so much I think was one of or just being so overly communicative
[02:34:06.500 --> 02:34:11.380]  It's like a friend of mine devin who runs a legal eagle channel. He just keeps saying like stop talking, you know
[02:34:11.380 --> 02:34:15.620]  Just don't talk. That's why you have a lawyer and they really I think should stop talking
[02:34:15.620 --> 02:34:20.900]  But I think your assessment is is spot on the best thing they could do right now is to put the game back
[02:34:20.900 --> 02:34:24.500]  Say that apple forced them to do it gin up more negative sentiment against apple
[02:34:25.060 --> 02:34:30.740]  Try to litigate it in the courts where they may not win probably won't win but then go full on at
[02:34:31.060 --> 02:34:33.060]  congress and the eu because
[02:34:33.940 --> 02:34:41.220]  The eu and congress have both shown a massive under misunderstanding of how tech works right and I bring this up as an example
[02:34:41.220 --> 02:34:43.060]  but you look at the
[02:34:43.060 --> 02:34:48.100]  The browser ballot from microsoft famously. They wanted to help out opera and slept near and these other browsers
[02:34:48.900 --> 02:34:53.380]  Which now we have like two and a half two and a fork rendering engines left
[02:34:53.860 --> 02:34:56.260]  Like it's just they've decimated the browser industry
[02:34:56.820 --> 02:34:59.540]  And I don't think it'll do better for the app industry
[02:34:59.540 --> 02:35:03.940]  I think we'll get results that all of us look on thinking what why did we let this happen instead of doing anything?
[02:35:03.940 --> 02:35:07.460]  We can't stop it. Do you think that it do you think it's interesting?
[02:35:07.460 --> 02:35:14.660]  Yeah, it's interesting to to look at that decision in the the the conquest of the browser market by
[02:35:15.540 --> 02:35:17.540]  chrome and the blink engine
[02:35:17.540 --> 02:35:24.660]  um, do you think without that if microsoft were as free as ever or as free as apple is with ios to
[02:35:25.140 --> 02:35:26.580]  have their
[02:35:26.580 --> 02:35:28.340]  default engine
[02:35:28.340 --> 02:35:30.340]  in the default browser that
[02:35:32.580 --> 02:35:33.860]  That
[02:35:33.860 --> 02:35:38.100]  Edge would still be using them. You know, i'm not so sure that that would have stopped chrome's
[02:35:38.740 --> 02:35:41.060]  Rampage over windows as the default browser
[02:35:41.860 --> 02:35:45.380]  No, but I don't think it helped opera and I don't think it helped like I don't think it achieved what they want
[02:35:45.380 --> 02:35:49.540]  Like the same way like the ebook case where now amazon has 83 of the ebook market
[02:35:49.540 --> 02:35:55.380]  I don't think that helped necessarily it was it was a huge distraction that didn't actually help the fundamental notion that we
[02:35:55.620 --> 02:35:57.860]  In theory would be a lot better with a healthy
[02:35:58.420 --> 02:36:00.340]  market of multiple
[02:36:00.340 --> 02:36:04.740]  Rendering engines for the web and no matter what we seem to do or try
[02:36:06.660 --> 02:36:11.540]  We get down like you look at firefox these last couple weeks and gecko's not I mean who knows right?
[02:36:11.940 --> 02:36:12.660]  um
[02:36:12.660 --> 02:36:17.780]  yeah, and the last thing just one thing I wanted to add to is that I really do mean that that epic is not the
[02:36:17.860 --> 02:36:20.100]  batman that we want or need because like if you just
[02:36:20.820 --> 02:36:25.940]  I would have more confidence in epic if you if if they ran their store better if they ran their store the way they wanted
[02:36:25.940 --> 02:36:31.060]  Apple to there are still ongoing lawsuits including carlton from the fresh prince of bel air
[02:36:31.460 --> 02:36:33.940]  over epic take because epic said that they want
[02:36:34.420 --> 02:36:36.180]  To they want to get rid of the intermediation
[02:36:36.180 --> 02:36:39.300]  They want to let game creators sell directly to other gamers
[02:36:39.300 --> 02:36:41.940]  They want to make sure that the people who do the work get the money
[02:36:42.260 --> 02:36:46.900]  But at the same time they're famously being sued for taking other people's stuff and selling it
[02:36:47.220 --> 02:36:51.460]  As like emotes and other things in the epic store and giving the creators zero money
[02:36:51.460 --> 02:36:56.020]  Like they are their behavior is more egregious than apple in many of these circumstances. Well, and yet
[02:36:57.060 --> 02:37:02.500]  It well and it ties in too with the xbox game pass where there's the mature way to do it in the immature way
[02:37:02.580 --> 02:37:06.180]  And the sneaking this thing in as a trojan horse is immature
[02:37:06.340 --> 02:37:12.500]  It's good for me and you because it's a lot more fun to comment about as a you know
[02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:19.700]  Podcaster and a youtuber and a writer but it is clearly on its face a lot more childish behavior
[02:37:19.700 --> 02:37:24.740]  In terms of xbox, you know, it's not like xbox had a halo game for ios
[02:37:25.300 --> 02:37:32.020]  And then it got approved and then through an over-the-air update to the app turned the halo game into microsoft game pass
[02:37:32.020 --> 02:37:37.780]  And there's 100 games inside and what are you going to do now apple right which would have been exactly analogous, you know?
[02:37:38.180 --> 02:37:43.620]  It's I think um, yeah, no and every like netflix. I wasn't aware of this until I saw it yesterday
[02:37:43.620 --> 02:37:46.740]  but netflix is being uh scrutinized because of the way that they
[02:37:46.740 --> 02:37:50.180]  People are actually saying that netflix has a monopoly over netflix content and aren't
[02:37:50.980 --> 02:37:56.900]  Aren't don't deal well with other creators and demand all the rights and and the same arguments are going on there
[02:37:57.220 --> 02:38:01.620]  And I think there's just an upsell upswell of independence and creator ownership
[02:38:02.500 --> 02:38:06.820]  That is surging and I just want to be real clear that epic does not represent any of that
[02:38:07.140 --> 02:38:10.100]  So like I want the app store to change. I think the app store has to change
[02:38:10.100 --> 02:38:15.140]  I think there's a whole conversation about what what the app stores can do to be better for intranet
[02:38:15.140 --> 02:38:22.660]  Developers, this isn't that uh at all. Yeah. Yeah, it's just some it's some very interesting striking and very
[02:38:23.300 --> 02:38:29.300]  You know similarities because xbox and fortnite are all about games and the hay thing is interesting because it's about
[02:38:29.380 --> 02:38:34.580]  It's not even spotify where they have to pay artists like it's not like epic is literally refusing to pay the people whose money they're making
[02:38:34.900 --> 02:38:42.180]  It's an argument over who gets to keep all of the profits from casino-like businesses. Yeah. Yeah. All right renee
[02:38:42.180 --> 02:38:48.980]  That's uh, that's a call it a wrap. I mean, we've got plenty more to go on episode. Yeah short episode. It's short year
