[00:00.000 --> 00:05.680]  I was so excited yesterday. I was in receipt of many exciting things from China. Oh yeah,
[00:05.680 --> 00:10.580]  many Chinese things arrived in my house yesterday. And it's very early for me. I slept in a little
[00:10.580 --> 00:15.200]  bit, so I'm kind of out of it. Yeah, so I was really excited. I got the new big boy
[00:15.200 --> 00:20.640]  iPad and I hurriedly, I said, they said, honey, you watch, watch, watch, watch some cartoons.
[00:20.640 --> 00:25.800]  I'm going to go to the office and I'm going to go restore my iPad. And I got there and
[00:25.800 --> 00:34.240]  I went, Hmm, because I have a retina 5k iMac from two, three years ago, the first retina
[00:34.240 --> 00:39.000]  5k iMac. That's I still got that. And I stood there like, like my late stepfather holding
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.320]  a cord with two different things on it going, Hmm, Hmm, looking back and forth. And I realized
[00:44.320 --> 00:49.520]  at my office, as it stands, I do not have any way to go from this particular machine
[00:49.520 --> 00:55.800]  to USB-C that I know of. It's, it is funny. I don't have that either. I've got a bunch
[00:55.800 --> 01:02.360]  of, I got my front pocket of my backpack is a, I got one of these backpacks. That's where
[01:02.360 --> 01:07.800]  you store dongle town. Yeah, it's a, it's a very small pocket, but I now have many,
[01:07.800 --> 01:13.640]  many dongles and it's not, not even all of them are USB-C related. They just have, right.
[01:13.640 --> 01:17.960]  I decided that I would, I'm never going to get caught short again without a dog. Right.
[01:17.960 --> 01:23.400]  I have a bag that up until this week was real good for that purpose. It's just that, you
[01:23.400 --> 01:26.640]  know, you're the one who studied math, you're the engineer, but my, if you think about it,
[01:26.640 --> 01:33.280]  it used to be mostly as simple as you go on the road with whatever and you need, uh, some
[01:33.280 --> 01:41.000]  kind of little plug thing that goes from USB-A to 30 pin. And now over time, as I got more
[01:41.000 --> 01:46.360]  other devices, not Apple devices that became a micro, but usually many USB mini, you gotta
[01:46.360 --> 01:49.760]  account for that. So in that case, I always get them wrong, but whatever the one is this
[01:49.760 --> 01:56.200]  is flat and popular. Uh, I got, I got that kind that's reversible or flippable, right?
[01:56.200 --> 01:59.760]  Where you can put it in either way and it usually works cause I would always get it
[01:59.760 --> 02:03.760]  wrong. You know, we get it wrong more than 50% of the time. I got one of those, I had
[02:03.760 --> 02:07.240]  all of those, you know, but the problem is then, uh, then you start getting this, this
[02:07.240 --> 02:11.040]  weird, like anytime you draw that, do that network drawing with more than a few dots
[02:11.040 --> 02:15.800]  and connect all the dots, it becomes hopelessly confusing. You had USB-C to that mix and now
[02:15.800 --> 02:20.120]  all of a sudden I, I, I don't know, I feel like professor Frank or something like that.
[02:20.120 --> 02:24.340]  I'm going to need several different, and I honestly, there will certainly be things where
[02:24.340 --> 02:28.120]  I complain about Apple today. I'm honestly not complaining. I'm just noting that like
[02:28.120 --> 02:33.600]  I thought I had, I thought I had a wired man. I had the, literally I had the anchor hub,
[02:33.600 --> 02:38.700]  the USB-C hub that was great for going on the road. I've got, I'm, I'm pretty like stored
[02:38.700 --> 02:42.900]  up at this point with having devices that charge faster, you know, with between iPads
[02:42.900 --> 02:50.300]  and iPhones. I've got the higher powered, uh, USB adapters. Yeah. But now I need to
[02:50.300 --> 02:53.740]  revisit the whole system. I have a, I have a go bag where I can just throw in a suitcase
[02:53.740 --> 02:58.120]  and know to a certainty that everything from the Apple watch to the Fitbit, to the Mac,
[02:58.120 --> 03:03.440]  to the iPad does will all be taken care of. And I knew I'd be good. And I do need to revisit
[03:03.440 --> 03:07.340]  that. And I think it's going to possibly get more complex. You know, it is weird cause
[03:07.340 --> 03:12.040]  it doesn't seem like there's too many things out there, right? Most of everything I've
[03:12.040 --> 03:18.160]  gotten either needs the, you know, the lightning or the USB-C now, but you still have some
[03:18.160 --> 03:22.000]  mostly lightning. I mean, let's be honest up until, you know, this week. Well, but then
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.360]  you've also got your, your oddball devices that need the, uh, I don't even know what
[03:26.360 --> 03:31.520]  it's called. Mini was the one that was, was not even that many. Mini was the one that
[03:31.520 --> 03:38.920]  was the Android ish one that's taller and like a trapezoid kind of, and then the one
[03:38.920 --> 03:44.480]  in a what, like in everything else is my modern devices as micro. Right. And so like my external
[03:44.480 --> 03:48.240]  battery packs, you know, they, those things need to always need micro, who knows why they
[03:48.240 --> 03:53.400]  got it. If we could get those things on USB-C, it would really upgrade the world. Uh, I think
[03:53.400 --> 03:58.240]  the Kindle still takes the micro. I don't know. I've got a brand new, I have a brand
[03:58.240 --> 04:03.280]  new Kindle upstairs that I got came like three and a half weeks ago and I still haven't opened
[04:03.280 --> 04:07.200]  the box because it's like busiest. It's like the busy time of the year for me and I've
[04:07.200 --> 04:13.120]  got all these other things. It's like I can't Dick around with a new Kindle. Well, you know,
[04:13.120 --> 04:18.400]  it's it, I dunno, this is actually a somewhat interesting, I think somewhat germane topic,
[04:18.400 --> 04:25.520]  which is like almost all the time in Apple since let's say what, 1998. I mean in all
[04:25.520 --> 04:30.240]  the time since then it always feels like we're in the middle of a transition, whether that's,
[04:30.240 --> 04:35.560]  let's start with, you know, floppies not being relevant anymore. The widespread, uh, adoption
[04:35.560 --> 04:40.640]  of USB-A, but really at every step along the way. I mean, uh, it's only people like my
[04:40.640 --> 04:44.020]  friend John Roderick that feel like it was 30 pin jacks forever. And then why does Apple
[04:44.020 --> 04:48.080]  keep changing it? It really is. It's a constant time of transition. And so you just look at
[04:48.080 --> 04:52.400]  the one vector of this thing you plug in to your device. Let's say the most basic one.
[04:52.400 --> 04:55.720]  You need a way to charge your iPhone. Well, of course you need a way to charge your iPhone,
[04:55.720 --> 05:00.240]  but in a lot of cases you also need a way to get data over that cable, which changes
[05:00.240 --> 05:04.000]  things a little bit because if you are traveling and have multiple devices and you don't want
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.040]  to be an insane person carrying like a Dr. Satchel full of these things around, you have
[05:08.040 --> 05:13.160]  to really think all that stuff through. And the USB-C does, does complicate that. Uh,
[05:13.160 --> 05:19.920]  cause like for example, I was thinking, so what do you use to charge your iPhone from
[05:19.920 --> 05:25.280]  your new iPad that must be USB-C to lightning, right? Do you have that cable? No, I don't
[05:25.280 --> 05:30.360]  have that cable. I don't think I do. I really don't think I do. I'm not complaining. I might
[05:30.360 --> 05:35.040]  have it, but I'm becoming aware that I have to jump on the segue and go back and forth
[05:35.040 --> 05:39.680]  to the house three times. And I still could not figure. It was like, it's like the thing
[05:39.680 --> 05:43.800]  my kid does now. She's a, she's in fifth grade and she has these logic problems where like
[05:43.800 --> 05:47.760]  Doug is sitting next to John and John has a hoagie and it's like, you go, ah, so, so
[05:47.760 --> 05:52.600]  who's on the train? And, and, uh, and I eventually gave up and went with, um, iCloud backup because
[05:52.600 --> 05:57.320]  I am a compulsive iCloud back-upper. I actually prefer the iCloud for the restore. It's come
[05:57.320 --> 06:03.160]  so far, John. It's really stem to stern the entire thing. Uh, Oh yeah. And again, so you're,
[06:03.160 --> 06:06.400]  you're making the point for me, which was if we only account for power, that's one thing.
[06:06.400 --> 06:10.360]  If we only account for data or, you know, that's another thing. Well, we were, what
[06:10.360 --> 06:13.680]  we still need to get our head around if we're going to stay in this universe is all the
[06:13.680 --> 06:19.000]  other stuff too. We also, we do have the constant of mostly 10 hour plus or minus battery life
[06:19.000 --> 06:24.760]  to keep in mind. But I mean, we've talked about this how many times where sometimes
[06:24.760 --> 06:28.860]  your LTE connection some places is actually faster than the wifi connection. You can do
[06:28.860 --> 06:34.000]  some pretty substantial stuff and not have to check on it constantly. It's not like burning
[06:34.000 --> 06:39.020]  a CD in like 2002 like you can, you know, that stuff is eventually going to work, but
[06:39.020 --> 06:42.720]  you do have to take all that into account. You have to then think about stuff like, uh,
[06:42.720 --> 06:48.880]  still USB, USB keys for moving stuff around things like the files, uh, apps and services.
[06:48.880 --> 06:53.420]  And you know, if we, I guess what I'm trying to say is in order to avoid becoming a completely
[06:53.420 --> 06:57.520]  unhappy old man, it is important for me to keep focusing on where things are and where
[06:57.520 --> 07:03.080]  they are going rather than gazing exclusively at where I thought they should be in 1987.
[07:03.080 --> 07:09.260]  You know, I don't miss scuzzy 50. I don't miss it. That was, it was brutal. I, you have
[07:09.260 --> 07:14.080]  to take into account how the entire ecosystem works together and is moving. And of all the
[07:14.080 --> 07:17.980]  things we can be skeptical with about Apple, I think one is that they have a pretty good
[07:17.980 --> 07:23.400]  idea about how it will fit together. I hope. Yeah, I think the weird thing too that, um,
[07:23.400 --> 07:29.160]  while testing this new iPad, I at one point, um, on the last day, I think because the reviews
[07:29.160 --> 07:32.760]  were going up Monday morning, let me see if I have a timeline. Yeah. Monday was the iPads
[07:32.760 --> 07:40.400]  and Tuesday was Mac book air. Um, I had been using this iPad for the better part of a week,
[07:40.400 --> 07:44.800]  but Amy is a much more avid iPad user than me and I wanted her to use it cause I was
[07:44.800 --> 07:50.280]  really interested if her perspective of would she like this size, meaning the 12.9 and so
[07:50.280 --> 07:55.400]  I wiped it and, and gave it to her and let her restore her iPad thing. And again, that
[07:55.400 --> 07:59.960]  went so fast. It was like, ah, this could be a nightmare. This, you know, am I misremembering
[07:59.960 --> 08:03.000]  how quick it was for me to set this up? And it was seriously, it was like, I don't know,
[08:03.000 --> 08:06.600]  isn't there a small part of your mind? I mean like, so just real quick. So what I do, here's
[08:06.600 --> 08:13.120]  my, I screw up was I'm running, uh, the developer betas on most of my iOS devices cause I'm
[08:13.120 --> 08:19.040]  that guy. Um, and of course my backup was 12, one, one. And so I try to restore and
[08:19.040 --> 08:25.680]  it says, sorry, no luck. So I wipe, I start over and now I have to get to, but it turns
[08:25.680 --> 08:29.920]  out in the time since then, even in that day now it's gotta be 12, one, two. So I gotta
[08:29.920 --> 08:34.200]  get them both up to 12, one. This is not a huge problem, but it was an extra like three
[08:34.200 --> 08:38.240]  hours all told. But what you're saying is correct. If you're in normie and just running
[08:38.240 --> 08:41.560]  normal software, that's just probably going to work fine. And it is shocking. All you
[08:41.560 --> 08:45.580]  have to do is go to reset. Please be very careful and don't just do this while I'm talking.
[08:45.580 --> 08:48.600]  You go to reset, you say erase all content and settings and then you just comes back
[08:48.600 --> 08:51.920]  up and you say, restore from iCloud. Which one do you want? And that's it. That's really,
[08:51.920 --> 08:56.680]  it really, it's shocking how fast. Oh, and also then the new thing where you get basic
[08:56.680 --> 09:00.960]  settings from a nearby iOS device, sort of like with the Apple TV set up. That's great.
[09:00.960 --> 09:06.200]  Yeah. Yeah. Get you on the wifi and stuff like that. So you don't have to type in your
[09:06.200 --> 09:11.040]  fiddly. So you see wiping, give it to her. Tell me what you think about this. Well, she
[09:11.040 --> 09:14.800]  likes it and she's like, yeah, I think I want this size. And she said, I think her exact
[09:14.800 --> 09:20.360]  words were, if, if the iPad is your jam, the size is your jam. This is, this is what people,
[09:20.360 --> 09:26.000]  you know, she got the big boy, the big boy, the 12.9 inch one and, and you know, but then
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.920]  it's like bedtime and she's going to bed and she's got like one lightning cable on her
[09:29.920 --> 09:34.920]  side of the bed and she's like, she's like, how do I plug this in? And I was like, no,
[09:34.920 --> 09:39.560]  no, it needs a new, it needs a new plug idiot. And she's looking at the bottom of this and
[09:39.560 --> 09:43.400]  she goes, you're telling me this is different. And I said, yeah. And she goes, you've got
[09:43.400 --> 09:49.560]  to be shitting me. And she's like, well, wait, if I put the new plug over here, will that
[09:49.560 --> 09:55.640]  one plug my phone, charge my phone? I was like, no, it's, it's box full of asterisks
[09:55.640 --> 10:01.200]  about how this is better. Yeah. And I'm not even sold that it's better. You know, I, I
[10:01.200 --> 10:05.480]  get, I get, I see the trade offs, right? I can make, I can make the list of pros and
[10:05.480 --> 10:09.600]  cons and, but she just looked at it and just was like, you've got to be shitting me. This
[10:09.600 --> 10:13.640]  is ridiculous. Okay. I've got these lightning cables, you know, everywhere I need them around
[10:13.640 --> 10:19.920]  the house to charge whatever. I'll often buy the Amazon ones cause they sell a six foot
[10:19.920 --> 10:23.560]  one or whatever the long, longer than the one that comes with it. I frequently buy them.
[10:23.560 --> 10:26.960]  And when I do, when I get them from Amazon, I buy them in pairs because when am I not
[10:26.960 --> 10:30.960]  going to need those? Well, not least because they get that little crayon mark. Eventually
[10:30.960 --> 10:33.560]  if you use them long enough, you get that little corrosion on there and you want to
[10:33.560 --> 10:39.160]  be able to switch them out, that kind of stuff. So I've got, I'm lousy with with those cables.
[10:39.160 --> 10:44.640]  I've been buying the ones from, uh, I always forget the name of the price, mono price,
[10:44.640 --> 10:51.720]  the mono price ones that have three caps. Uh, so it's, it natively, the cable has the
[10:51.720 --> 10:56.320]  micro USB, but then there's a lightning cap, like a little, little lightning condom you
[10:56.320 --> 11:01.500]  put on the top and it's, and it's connected. You know, there's, it's like a little tether.
[11:01.500 --> 11:05.880]  So it's not going to fly off like an apple pencil one. Yeah. So the one cable has all
[11:05.880 --> 11:10.680]  three things. You can do micro, you could do lightning, you can do USB-C. And as far
[11:10.680 --> 11:14.120]  as I can tell, you don't pay any kind of penalty on that. It's like when you're going with
[11:14.120 --> 11:20.120]  you, you put the USB-C cap on and you plug it into the powerful 30 watt charger, you're,
[11:20.120 --> 11:24.320]  you're getting the full 30 watt, you know, just because even though it's at some point
[11:24.320 --> 11:28.640]  going through a little micro USB thing, I don't, it doesn't see, I haven't done, I haven't
[11:28.640 --> 11:33.880]  send it to UL labs, but it seems like you don't lose anything. But I have to say it's,
[11:33.880 --> 11:42.040]  it is ugly. It's an ugly little tentacle of many cables at the end of the cable. It is.
[11:42.040 --> 11:46.160]  And there are so many things about, this is the first time in a pretty long time that
[11:46.160 --> 11:51.120]  except for my desktop Mac, which is, as I say, I think I got an August, I want to say
[11:51.120 --> 11:57.260]  of 2016 whenever, whenever the 5k right now was relatively new. I'm, I'm up to date on
[11:57.260 --> 12:01.560]  all my devices right now. I've got like, I'm a fancy boy and I've got recent versions of
[12:01.560 --> 12:06.560]  everything. And then, you know, it is funny what, what they say, you get used to this
[12:06.560 --> 12:12.320]  or you come to expect this. It is kind of funny at almost almost every step I have been
[12:12.320 --> 12:16.600]  proven utterly wrong. Like when I saw the notch, I was like, you've got to be kidding
[12:16.600 --> 12:22.880]  me. I will never not see the notch all the time. And now I'm on my second iPhone 10 series
[12:22.880 --> 12:29.320]  and it's, I'd see it, but it doesn't bother me. It's, it's, it doesn't bug me at all.
[12:29.320 --> 12:33.680]  And further to that point. So I had spent just enough time setting up this goal or just
[12:33.680 --> 12:39.480]  new iPad yesterday, just enough time that when I popped over to flip on the previous
[12:39.480 --> 12:44.680]  iPad pro 10 inch, I went, Hmm, that's kind of a, that's kind of a modest size screen.
[12:44.680 --> 12:48.480]  It's no different than my feeling of picking up my kid's iPod. She never uses anymore just
[12:48.480 --> 12:52.340]  to make sure it's up to date. And I go, Oh my gosh, this is like Roman on a postage stamp.
[12:52.340 --> 12:57.000]  This thing feels so little. It is, it is strange. But, but the other, the corollary to that
[12:57.000 --> 13:04.020]  is that, but you increasingly do notice how, how crazy some stuff is like, it really feels
[13:04.020 --> 13:09.880]  like we should be closer to truly wireless charging. For example, you know, when you,
[13:09.880 --> 13:14.080]  I mean the, the apex of this and thank God this has gone away. Of course, the lollipop
[13:14.080 --> 13:21.820]  effect of sticking your Apple pencil one into your iPad never stopped feeling utterly asinine
[13:21.820 --> 13:26.240]  a second only perhaps to that mouse you had to flip over to stick the charger into. Well,
[13:26.240 --> 13:31.040]  you get used to most all of it, but you also become increasingly aware of like, God damn,
[13:31.040 --> 13:34.120]  this thing is so good at so many of these things that it does really feel like a little
[13:34.120 --> 13:38.720]  bit of a legacy relic to have certain things, including a cable sticking out of the bottom
[13:38.720 --> 13:42.560]  wire trying to use it. I was thinking about this the other day. It's funny. I could tell
[13:42.560 --> 13:45.800]  you exactly what block of the city I was on. I was just talking to, I don't know if this
[13:45.800 --> 13:50.320]  is like an age thing or what, but more and more it's like I can remember exactly where
[13:50.320 --> 13:56.120]  and when I was when I had a thought. Oh yeah. So I can remember them at all. I can usually
[13:56.120 --> 13:59.240]  remember. I think it's the other way around. I think it's, you just don't remember much.
[13:59.240 --> 14:02.800]  You probably always remember, but now it's the thoughts you do remember, you know, so
[14:02.800 --> 14:06.280]  what you got to see, you've got the new pencil thing. Yeah, no, you didn't get the pencil.
[14:06.280 --> 14:10.440]  I did. No, no, I got, I got, I got everything. Yeah, I'm the four digit club. The new pencil
[14:10.440 --> 14:15.660]  is, is the greatest little Apple thing I can. I raved about it better in at least three
[14:15.660 --> 14:19.800]  or four ways. I raved about it in my review. It was the little sentence of the review that
[14:19.800 --> 14:24.600]  Apple picked up and, and put on there like what the reviewers are saying, which is always
[14:24.600 --> 14:29.360]  a weird thing for me. I always think, I think like I can't, you know, I should, I shouldn't
[14:29.360 --> 14:33.560]  understand that, that Apple reads my stuff and cares what I think, but it's like, Whoa,
[14:33.560 --> 14:38.960]  I can't believe they're quoting me the shit sandwich one. No, I didn't use that, but I,
[14:38.960 --> 14:43.040]  I feel like even though I raved about it so much that Apple even picked that segment to
[14:43.040 --> 14:47.640]  talk about it, I still don't feel like I did justice to just how beautiful this, this thing
[14:47.640 --> 14:54.300]  is and every aspect of it like, and I even wrote in my little thing that it nears perfection
[14:54.300 --> 15:00.200]  for the concept. So in theory, somebody could have a concept of a stylist that works differently,
[15:00.200 --> 15:03.680]  something that has like three little clicky buttons. So you could just sit there and click,
[15:03.680 --> 15:08.280]  you know, there's other ways to do a stylist, but the idea of a stylist with no buttons
[15:08.280 --> 15:15.040]  that just works. This, this new one is, it is seriously near perfection. The one and
[15:15.040 --> 15:18.520]  only idea I really sat there and thought, well, how would I even suggest an improvement?
[15:18.520 --> 15:23.240]  The only thing I could think of was it would be nice if it had like haptic feedback for
[15:23.240 --> 15:28.700]  that double tap thing. Cause as it stands, you, you double tap it. And whether to tell
[15:28.700 --> 15:32.040]  sometimes if it's taken, especially on an app that has been updated, you don't know
[15:32.040 --> 15:36.160]  that you've missed the pencil itself has no feedback to offer you. So the only way you
[15:36.160 --> 15:40.120]  can get feedback is in the app you're using. And so like the notes app, which has been
[15:40.120 --> 15:45.360]  updated for it, you, the little eraser will pop up, it animates and has a little spring
[15:45.360 --> 15:49.560]  to it, you know, and it's like, okay, you switched to the eraser by, by double tapping.
[15:49.560 --> 15:53.360]  It would be nice if the pencil offered you that feedback. But other than that, I can't
[15:53.360 --> 15:56.640]  even think of a way to improve it. It's so beautiful. And you're right that the, and
[15:56.640 --> 16:01.800]  I was still with the thought I had the other day was, was about the, the bad rap that the
[16:01.800 --> 16:07.440]  old pencil got for that lollipop effect you're talking about. Cause it was awkward. It did
[16:07.440 --> 16:12.240]  look silly. It always, and I don't know why every time I did it, I feel like, oh Christ,
[16:12.240 --> 16:15.840]  don't break it. You know, it just felt like, cause it's just sticking out and I never came
[16:15.840 --> 16:20.200]  close to breaking it, you know, but it's not the kind of thing you would see in an Apple
[16:20.200 --> 16:26.040]  product photo, you know, feature. It, it, it looks really weird and it's an anxiety
[16:26.040 --> 16:31.480]  making, but it was, but I totally see why they did it right. It's totally justifiable
[16:31.480 --> 16:35.880]  because in addition to charging and in addition to the fact that when the pencil is low on
[16:35.880 --> 16:39.960]  juice, you only, you really only needed to stick it in for a couple of seconds, you know,
[16:39.960 --> 16:46.640]  30 seconds and you'd be good for a long stretch. But the fact that it also is what paired it
[16:46.640 --> 16:51.000]  to the iPad. So if you've got one pencil and a couple of iPads and you know, you're not
[16:51.000 --> 16:53.680]  even, you know, it's like, this isn't your pencil. You just stick it in the lightning
[16:53.680 --> 16:57.580]  port and it's like, okay, I got you. And now this is the, the iPad is saying, this is my
[16:57.580 --> 17:00.680]  pencil now. Got it. It's brilliant. You know, you don't have to go to settings. You don't
[17:00.680 --> 17:07.200]  have to, you know, pair. There's no, you know, it's, it's brilliant, but boy, this is so
[17:07.200 --> 17:11.680]  much better without having to actually stick it in a port. Just snap. Yeah. And this is
[17:11.680 --> 17:16.980]  something I, uh, I feel like I say, I don't like to invoke the whole specter of Steve
[17:16.980 --> 17:20.520]  jobs for things. I think it's pretty lame most of the time, but there's a tremendous
[17:20.520 --> 17:26.280]  irony in the fact that it is a stylist that is the product I look at from the last five
[17:26.280 --> 17:29.720]  years. I go, wow, Steve jobs wouldn't like this ironic of course, cause of the, you blew
[17:29.720 --> 17:35.360]  it line. Um, but this is a very Steve jobs kind of thing. Um, just the subtle touches
[17:35.360 --> 17:39.600]  of this does not feel to me like a purely Johnny type of thing. I think the first pencil
[17:39.600 --> 17:43.080]  feels like a very Johnny kind of thing cause it looks great until you have to use it. And
[17:43.080 --> 17:47.400]  then it's kind of silly. And in this case, no offense, but in this case the thing looks
[17:47.400 --> 17:52.360]  great no matter how you're using it. The subtlety of like, it's fun. I wonder, you know, if
[17:52.360 --> 17:55.320]  they certainly must've thought of calling it the number two pencil, but that would have
[17:55.320 --> 18:01.240]  been confusing. But adding that what would be the one flat side would, I think that's
[18:01.240 --> 18:05.720]  probably a hexagonal plane. If you'd done that all the way around, it would be, it feels
[18:05.720 --> 18:12.120]  like a pencil on that part. Yes, it does pop right on. Another one that's so subtle. Uh,
[18:12.120 --> 18:16.360]  it feels real sturdy, but the, the texture, it's so strange. They're so good at materials.
[18:16.360 --> 18:20.560]  The texture of this thing. If, if God forbid Steve jobs ever had to live to see a stylist
[18:20.560 --> 18:25.040]  on one of his devices, I think he'd be proud of this one. I think this really, uh, especially
[18:25.040 --> 18:30.260]  for, I consider this a 1.0 I feel like this is a real do over. I guess the tips are similar,
[18:30.260 --> 18:33.620]  but this feels like a real do over of the concept. And I think he would be very proud
[18:33.620 --> 18:37.880]  of this. I think this would fit into his idea of how we interact with stuff. And that's,
[18:37.880 --> 18:41.800]  you know, if you go back and listen to what he said, I think his, his context was clearly,
[18:41.800 --> 18:46.760]  well, a, it was a classic jobs in if we don't have to use, you have to use a style. Yeah,
[18:46.760 --> 18:51.520]  it was about having, you know, a, a device where, where, where there are certain features
[18:51.520 --> 18:55.880]  that require the stylist and that's what he meant by blew it. I don't think that he even,
[18:55.880 --> 19:01.440]  even then at that moment was opposed to say the fact that, you know, that there were plenty
[19:01.440 --> 19:07.280]  of people using Wacom tablets with Macintosh computers, you know, and a stylist, you know,
[19:07.280 --> 19:12.840]  that there's of course artists need a stylist to draw. Um, but you know, there's a classic
[19:12.840 --> 19:18.680]  jobs in if Apple isn't selling X yet, then every X on the market is both unnecessary
[19:18.680 --> 19:23.480]  and garbage. Garbage is just poor design. Yeah. A hundred percent. Another one of his,
[19:23.480 --> 19:26.920]  uh, I don't, I don't know if this is apocryphal, but the, I feel like I remember him saying
[19:26.920 --> 19:32.200]  it one time, nobody, nobody's gonna, nobody watches movies. I remember it was when the
[19:32.200 --> 19:38.760]  first color iPod came out with and it only had support for photos. Yeah. And talk about
[19:38.760 --> 19:43.480]  that. That's the thing. That's the thing is I do remember having that particular, whichever
[19:43.480 --> 19:48.120]  iPad, iPod was the first one that could show a video and it was, I do feel like it was
[19:48.120 --> 19:54.160]  easily one of the first things I ever bought, uh, as like an eye, a videos thing from iTunes.
[19:54.160 --> 19:58.320]  I think I bought a few episodes of the show psych and I remember specifically I was staying
[19:58.320 --> 20:03.040]  at John Roderick's house and in his mom's guest room and I remember having the dingus
[20:03.040 --> 20:10.920]  that would let me go to RCA cables and I was, I was watching video from an eye iPod on a
[20:10.920 --> 20:17.140]  TV and, but it did feel very exotic. It did feel very, I enjoyed the episode y'all did
[20:17.140 --> 20:21.400]  about 2001 on the incomparable. Oh yeah. Very much feel like something, you know, a little
[20:21.400 --> 20:26.000]  bit proto Heywood, you know, like when you're on your way, you're hanging out, waiting to
[20:26.000 --> 20:31.160]  talk to the Russians and you pull out your video device in portrait mode. But that was,
[20:31.160 --> 20:35.080]  that was very exotic at the time. And now one of the reasons I suggest to people, if
[20:35.080 --> 20:38.680]  you're going to be a dumb, rich boy and buy one of these things, don't buy 64 and everybody's
[20:38.680 --> 20:41.960]  well, why would I ever use more? I look now I'm not using 64. I was like, this is a movie
[20:41.960 --> 20:46.040]  machine. If you have a kid, you could have 10 movies on this thing all the time and never
[20:46.040 --> 20:50.380]  even notice. But if you, you pick you, you get Scott Pilgrim, you get Harry Potter three,
[20:50.380 --> 20:54.240]  you get a few classic movies that everybody likes and you put it on here. And now when
[20:54.240 --> 20:58.400]  you're somewhere with no connectivity, you have a movie machine that looks stunning.
[20:58.400 --> 21:03.000]  This screen is bigger and certainly more colorful than the screen that I grew up with as a child.
[21:03.000 --> 21:07.840]  And it is a primary way that tons of people, especially young people watch video. Now that
[21:07.840 --> 21:12.040]  changed a lot. Yeah, I don't have anything that takes up significant space on my iPads
[21:12.040 --> 21:16.640]  other than the movies, you know, and it was, you know, I don't have a little kids anymore.
[21:16.640 --> 21:20.560]  So it's not, it's not, you know, thank God though, that would have made life easier if
[21:20.560 --> 21:22.000]  we'd had these things back then.
[21:22.000 --> 21:26.840]  Is he mostly, is he, it's so funny. So John, so much of the stuff you told me about our
[21:26.840 --> 21:30.940]  kids are, I think three, four years apart. Yeah. We're just looking at pictures of them
[21:30.940 --> 21:35.680]  back in Wellington. They're so low. But it's, it's so funny things you would say about how
[21:35.680 --> 21:39.520]  your, your son is like, he's doing like three different things at once on three different
[21:39.520 --> 21:44.320]  devices. And I'm like, Oh, that's so silly. How would you allow that? And I shot a video
[21:44.320 --> 21:49.460]  the other day of my kid playing Minecraft while watching on the iPad while watching
[21:49.460 --> 21:54.540]  Brooklyn nine, nine on the TV as she was on speakerphone with her friend who was also
[21:54.540 --> 21:58.060]  playing Minecraft on an iPad.
[21:58.060 --> 22:02.140]  It is there. The way they multitask is definitely a multi-device. It's like this device is doing
[22:02.140 --> 22:06.560]  this and this one's doing that. And so he's still like a big YouTube. Oh yeah. Right.
[22:06.560 --> 22:10.620]  Yep. Yeah. And it's so bizarre. And he'll have like a FaceTime call going with a buddy
[22:10.620 --> 22:15.840]  and they're like, I'm like, are you guys watching the same thing? And he's like, no, no, we're
[22:15.840 --> 22:21.240]  not dating. Right. But you know, maybe this is part of a, this section is, ends up being
[22:21.240 --> 22:27.160]  somewhat thematic, which is like, you know, anytime you're looking at this stuff, when
[22:27.160 --> 22:31.620]  you and I were maybe a little bit younger, we could always kind of groan and grunt and
[22:31.620 --> 22:35.680]  point at the olds who just didn't understand. And a certain time, most, you know what they
[22:35.680 --> 22:39.560]  didn't understand a desktop computer. Like, Oh, why do you need that? Why don't you use
[22:39.560 --> 22:42.720]  a typewriter? And you're like, Oh, you poor old man, you don't understand this. And now
[22:42.720 --> 22:46.280]  we are the ones who are constantly in danger of becoming that. And like the presence of
[22:46.280 --> 22:50.800]  mind that I think is valuable to hold in your head when, when it can occur to you is to
[22:50.800 --> 22:55.140]  look at where this is and where this is going rather than exclusively looking at how it
[22:55.140 --> 22:59.440]  squares up with what you've done in the past. Like you can get the terminal on lots of stuff,
[22:59.440 --> 23:03.100]  but you know, just update, that's not the best way to do stuff nowadays. There's a lot
[23:03.100 --> 23:10.060]  of really nice ways and learning to hue or mold or turn to the way that Apple is going
[23:10.060 --> 23:14.360]  is not a terrible idea if you want to stay in this ecosystem. All right, let me take
[23:14.360 --> 23:18.840]  a break here and thank our first special friend. That's our good friend at away. You guys know
[23:18.840 --> 23:25.960]  a way they make super high quality suitcases. Uh, look, you go there, you go to a way.com,
[23:25.960 --> 23:31.040]  you pick a suitcase. They got, here's their sizes. You carry on the bigger carry on the
[23:31.040 --> 23:35.960]  medium and the large. It tells you everything you need to know about. You don't have to.
[23:35.960 --> 23:40.600]  It's not like grande and tall and whatever. Oh, you mean the words mean stuff? Yeah. The
[23:40.600 --> 23:46.420]  words mean something. Uh, look, these are great. They have a whole bunch of, uh, colors
[23:46.420 --> 23:52.840]  to pick from. Uh, they're all made from premium German polycarbonate, unrivaled in strength
[23:52.840 --> 23:57.480]  and impact resistance. If long time listeners of the show, you know how long away has been
[23:57.480 --> 24:02.680]  sponsoring this show and before they, uh, the, the first time they sponsored the show,
[24:02.680 --> 24:07.440]  they sent me a carry on. This is years ago and I still use it. I've taken it on every
[24:07.440 --> 24:13.240]  single airplane trip I've gone on for years and the damn thing looks brand new. I, it's
[24:13.240 --> 24:17.800]  really, these things are very, very well made. The wheels are still in perfect shape and
[24:17.800 --> 24:21.320]  they even like months ago they were like, Hey, do you need a new, you know, do you want
[24:21.320 --> 24:23.880]  us to send you another suitcase? And I'm like, you don't have to send me another suitcase.
[24:23.880 --> 24:28.320]  My other one's still brand new. I mean, I honestly, it's, what am I going to do with
[24:28.320 --> 24:32.400]  the new one that it's stuck. It's that good. I can use a new one, John, because they sent
[24:32.400 --> 24:36.660]  me one a few years ago too, but mine has been adopted. Like so many things in my home that
[24:36.660 --> 24:39.540]  used to belong to me, they now belong to someone else in the house who's decided that that's
[24:39.540 --> 24:44.560]  theirs now. Great wheels, the TSA approved combination lock, honestly, and kids, kids
[24:44.560 --> 24:52.540]  love them. Great. I swear to God, patent pending compression system. There's things inside
[24:52.540 --> 24:56.200]  and little, it's very simple. You don't need like an instruction manual, but it's a way
[24:56.200 --> 25:00.920]  to put like stuff that gets wrinkled, like dress shirts, put them in the suitcase. You
[25:00.920 --> 25:05.760]  put this thing on top, cinch it, and then the shirts stay nice and flat while, while
[25:05.760 --> 25:10.720]  you're abusing your luggage on an airplane. It's great. It's a great little system. They've
[25:10.720 --> 25:14.600]  got like a nice little bag built in that you can put your dirty clothes in for the trip
[25:14.600 --> 25:17.920]  and then all your dirty clothes when you get home or in a nice little bag, you just shake
[25:17.920 --> 25:23.560]  them into the hamper or whatever you do and they have a lifetime warranty. Anything breaks,
[25:23.560 --> 25:29.200]  they will fix it or replace it to you. Place it for you for life and you get a hundred
[25:29.200 --> 25:34.520]  day trial, a hundred days. So buy it, use it for three months, travel with it, take
[25:34.520 --> 25:38.560]  pictures, whatever you want to do with it. And then if you don't like it, you can get
[25:38.560 --> 25:42.840]  a full refund. No questions asked. That's how confident they are. You get free shipping
[25:42.840 --> 25:49.640]  on any order within the lower 48 states. Sorry, Alaska. And the carry-ons are compliant with
[25:49.640 --> 25:55.020]  all the major US airlines and they have a retail store in New York City. So if you're
[25:55.020 --> 25:58.440]  in New York, you can actually go see these things in person, but you really, because
[25:58.440 --> 26:02.160]  of this guarantee, the hundred day guarantee, you can, you can just buy it, just buy it
[26:02.160 --> 26:06.640]  over the internet. You don't have to go to the store. So here's the deal. You can save
[26:06.640 --> 26:11.560]  20 bucks off a suitcase by going to a waytravel.com. So I was wrong. It's not a way.com. It's away
[26:11.560 --> 26:18.480]  travel.com. That was a test slash talk show and use that promo code talk show T a L K
[26:18.480 --> 26:25.520]  S H O W during checkout. And you can save 20 bucks on a suitcase. It's a great value.
[26:25.520 --> 26:29.920]  Great product. Really? I mean this sincerely. I don't know what percentage of listeners
[26:29.920 --> 26:33.720]  of the show are using away suitcases, but I'll bet it's pretty high. Did you mention
[26:33.720 --> 26:39.460]  the charging? No, I didn't even mention the charging carry-ons come with during the lead
[26:39.460 --> 26:43.260]  a little bit because this thing is a butt saver. Yeah. And we were just talking about
[26:43.260 --> 26:47.980]  charging devices. It's got two, two USB out ports. So you can sit there at the airport
[26:47.980 --> 26:52.700]  and charge your devices if you have the right cable. And if you have the right cable that's
[26:52.700 --> 26:56.920]  on you though, that don't play them away, away travel. But it's a, it's also a, um,
[26:56.920 --> 27:02.200]  I mean mine's a few years old right now, but it's a pretty high capacity battery. I'm usually
[27:02.200 --> 27:07.000]  able to get like at least, I feel like I want to say, at least serve four full charges out
[27:07.000 --> 27:10.000]  of it and it's got a, it's got a higher, it's got, so it's pretty, pretty good capacity
[27:10.000 --> 27:16.280]  bad battery and it has two ports. Hey, well, Hey, sorry. Um, word choice. It's got two,
[27:16.280 --> 27:19.000]  two ports that you can use so you can charge two things at once. And one of them is a higher
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.960]  wattage that will charge your iPad faster. Did you know that you can get a free upgrade
[27:23.960 --> 27:28.480]  if you have an older one? I did this. I need this. I need this. This is how we get the
[27:28.480 --> 27:32.480]  little pop out little toaster effect, right? Yeah. So the original, their original design,
[27:32.480 --> 27:36.720]  you could remove the battery, but you needed like a Phillips head screwdriver and a couple
[27:36.720 --> 27:40.800]  of minutes of work, which would, might be tough if you're at the gate, you know, like
[27:40.800 --> 27:44.760]  the scenario, right? The scenario where you would need to do this is if you thought you
[27:44.760 --> 27:48.440]  were going to put your suitcase in the overhead bin and then they're like, we ran out of space,
[27:48.440 --> 27:53.480]  we need the gate, check the remaining bags and you're not supposed to put a lithium ion
[27:53.480 --> 27:58.560]  battery in a check bag. So you're supposed to take the battery out. Uh, so some of the
[27:58.560 --> 28:02.720]  airlines now, I don't even know which ones, but some of them have a policy where if it's
[28:02.720 --> 28:07.120]  not easily removable, you're not supposed to get it on the airplane at all. And so away
[28:07.120 --> 28:10.880]  has switched to a different design. Little, you just pop it, you just punch at it, you
[28:10.880 --> 28:14.380]  know, and it pops right out, pops right back in. But if you've got their older one, they'll
[28:14.380 --> 28:19.400]  send you a free kit to turn your old mounting thing into a new one, which is great. And
[28:19.400 --> 28:23.600]  you're right. It's super, I don't know how many mega amp hours. You can get at least
[28:23.600 --> 28:27.580]  five charges on an iPhone out of it and your management very, but no, it's, it's, it's
[28:27.580 --> 28:31.620]  pretty boss. Yeah. Especially if for me, cause you're not really there long enough to really
[28:31.620 --> 28:35.920]  like, you know, hopefully your bat, your phone isn't at zero at the airport, but you know,
[28:35.920 --> 28:39.360]  just to sit there on while you're waiting for your boarding group to be called to sit
[28:39.360 --> 28:44.680]  there and you know, fill up your iPhone as best you can for 20 minutes or whatever. It's
[28:44.680 --> 28:48.520]  fantastic. Yeah. You'll never be that guy at the airport sitting on the, I always feel
[28:48.520 --> 28:53.680]  so bad for the people who sit on the floor. Yeah. It's usually, and you know, I don't
[28:53.680 --> 28:58.160]  know if this isn't intended as punishment, but I, I am shocked at how often the available
[28:58.160 --> 29:02.360]  plugs are near a garbage can. So it's usually somebody sitting there with McDonald's next
[29:02.360 --> 29:05.320]  to a garbage can and you're like, oh, you poor son of a bitch. She got in the way, way
[29:05.320 --> 29:09.760]  travel. Right. And then the other thing too is that at airports there's the newer things
[29:09.760 --> 29:15.540]  too where there's like a bar, you know, like and they have stools and it's like, here's
[29:15.540 --> 29:20.320]  a place that is sort of, these are waiting seats where you're supposed to have your laptop
[29:20.320 --> 29:25.120]  out or something and there's, there's ports for everybody. Those seats are always taken.
[29:25.120 --> 29:28.120]  You can never get one of those seats. Like I don't even know who these people are. Like
[29:28.120 --> 29:33.040]  who, who, how do you get one of these seats? And it seems to me like people are like, wow,
[29:33.040 --> 29:39.360]  I'm so lucky I got one of these seats. I guess I'll just skip my flight and stay here. Like
[29:39.360 --> 29:44.280]  I never put aside when I'm traveling with the family and it's not really, you can't
[29:44.280 --> 29:48.040]  really get like three of them, but even when I'm by myself and I've got 40 minutes, you
[29:48.040 --> 29:52.960]  know, I've, I've cruised through security. I've got plenty of time to go. I never get
[29:52.960 --> 29:57.160]  one of those seats. So turn, you know, having the charger on your suitcase and you can sit
[29:57.160 --> 30:02.880]  anywhere and you can, you can charge your devices with you. It always, we always end
[30:02.880 --> 30:10.940]  up doing, but after the sponsor read, we do like a whole segment. No, we travel everybody.
[30:10.940 --> 30:17.640]  So the one thing I want to say, I will talk about these chargers is the weird. No, no,
[30:17.640 --> 30:21.280]  I do. They're good. They're real good. You know, they're also good in the hotel room
[30:21.280 --> 30:24.600]  or maybe you don't feel like maybe your anger doesn't work because you didn't bring the
[30:24.600 --> 30:29.040]  right course. No, but isn't it, but you, you mentioned this before where now the chargers,
[30:29.040 --> 30:33.920]  the high capacity ones, like the one that comes with the, the iPad in the box. And I
[30:33.920 --> 30:37.200]  think it's the one that I think it might be the same charger that comes with the Mac book
[30:37.200 --> 30:43.260]  air, the new air. It looks different to me. The one I've been getting from the Apple store,
[30:43.260 --> 30:47.680]  you can tell me the wattage, but it's the one guy. It's so fricking confusing because
[30:47.680 --> 30:52.320]  there's the tiny little boys that the iPad comes with an 18 watt charger. That's right.
[30:52.320 --> 30:58.800]  It's not the right. So I have taken stickers out of a Marvel Avengers sticker book and
[30:58.800 --> 31:02.560]  affix them to different things. So I've got, I've got a wasp on the low wattage ones and
[31:02.560 --> 31:07.840]  a Hulk on the high wattage ones. And I'm able, I'm able to identify when's the last time
[31:07.840 --> 31:15.520]  you tried to read what the wattage is. I know your vision is pretty much that of a pirate
[31:15.520 --> 31:20.220]  at this point, but very recently I use the triple click. It's the only way I can read
[31:20.220 --> 31:26.040]  even what the thing is. All right. And it's no, cause I was looking and I was comparing
[31:26.040 --> 31:31.960]  it and I recently bought a pixel three and that Google gives you an 18 watt charger with
[31:31.960 --> 31:36.720]  the pixels, you know, and, and it's a very similar looking thing to the iPad charger
[31:36.720 --> 31:42.840]  except Google's is bigger, of course. Um, but I'm trying to read what the wattage is
[31:42.840 --> 31:47.260]  on it and I just gave up and like Googled and found like the verges review and it's
[31:47.260 --> 31:52.580]  like verge tells me it's an 18 watt charger. So I was like, all right, it's 18. It's such
[31:52.580 --> 31:56.360]  an, it's one thing for Apple to not tell you exactly like what Ram is in this, et cetera,
[31:56.360 --> 32:01.400]  et cetera. It's such an Apple move to a make it so you have to unplug it to see what it
[32:01.400 --> 32:07.960]  is. Be have the writing be comically the type size is comically small and it's like, it's
[32:07.960 --> 32:14.000]  like having EEE over CCC. It's the lowest contrast decision you could have made. It
[32:14.000 --> 32:22.240]  is a very light gray text on a glossy white background. It is. I'll tell you. So Marvel
[32:22.240 --> 32:25.840]  stickers. It'll say it'll save your day. Yeah, no, no. This is, this is as long as we're
[32:25.840 --> 32:30.600]  talking about chargers. Yeah. So we have some setups where we try, you know, my wife is
[32:30.600 --> 32:35.240]  a grown woman and she doesn't want the house to look like a bachelor lives there. And so
[32:35.240 --> 32:40.000]  I try to make accommodations where I avoid things like the octopus of cables and I really
[32:40.000 --> 32:45.120]  try to have a balance between, okay, everybody has a place in a way cause everybody's got
[32:45.120 --> 32:49.200]  iPhones, everybody's got watches, everybody's got iPads and we need a place to charge those.
[32:49.200 --> 32:52.300]  Of course that's my job cause nobody else does it. Not that I'm complaining, but we
[32:52.300 --> 32:56.960]  have stations around the house. And in one case we've got something that I think was
[32:56.960 --> 33:04.300]  designed to be a old fashioned, like a bamboo letter sorter or folder holder. And so we've
[33:04.300 --> 33:08.960]  got that on a thing in the kitchen and I got one of those little zip up three channel.
[33:08.960 --> 33:14.320]  Have you seen the sleeves you can get? I forget the brand name, but it's like a sleeve with
[33:14.320 --> 33:19.320]  a zipper on it and three implied channels in it into which you can put cables and you
[33:19.320 --> 33:23.160]  don't get a big tangle. Oh yeah, I think I know it's got a little bit of wiring in it
[33:23.160 --> 33:28.240]  so it can kind of hold a shape. And because that's mostly hidden, I loop that around once,
[33:28.240 --> 33:32.160]  put a bulldog clip on it and stick that behind this thing. And it's mostly not ugly. I don't
[33:32.160 --> 33:35.440]  love going through the holes, the channels for those things to do that. It doesn't work
[33:35.440 --> 33:40.760]  for me. So anyway, we do that. And that was great because I had three of my Hulk plugs
[33:40.760 --> 33:45.320]  on there. So regardless of device, any lightning thing you put in there, you're going to be
[33:45.320 --> 33:51.200]  good. And then as a consideration to my, my grown ass adult wife, I put one in the hallway
[33:51.200 --> 33:54.540]  because that's where she tends to leave her phone. Right? So I'm doing that kind of Berkeley
[33:54.540 --> 33:57.180]  design thing where I'm going to wait until people make the pass and then I'll put down
[33:57.180 --> 34:01.120]  the concrete and say, Oh, you leave your phone here. I will give you, I will accommodate
[34:01.120 --> 34:05.480]  you by putting this charger there with this very low key wire. You can just kind of pull
[34:05.480 --> 34:11.880]  out, stick in there. I got one. What are the round wireless chargers? Is it Belkin? Who's
[34:11.880 --> 34:16.560]  the other one? What's a little round one for? I don't know. I've been buying, you know what
[34:16.560 --> 34:20.280]  I mean? I've been buying anchor stuff recently. I love anchor stuff. So I've got one of those
[34:20.280 --> 34:24.680]  next to where I sit on the couch as well as another lightning cable that's kind of there
[34:24.680 --> 34:29.220]  because everybody needs to charge stuff all the time. And now we've got USB-C so the system
[34:29.220 --> 34:34.400]  is going to have to change a little bit. Well, that's the thing, the thing that, that the,
[34:34.400 --> 34:39.480]  the transition that our family must go through down with our cables is that the, not the
[34:39.480 --> 34:44.380]  end of the charger that goes into your device, it's the end that goes into the charger, right?
[34:44.380 --> 34:48.440]  They used to all be, it used to all be the old USB-A or whatever that was called. And
[34:48.440 --> 34:54.600]  now they're, the new trend is that they're USB-C and that means we need new cables at
[34:54.600 --> 34:59.680]  the other end. And I have to say, and with all of the, you know, well maybe Apple should
[34:59.680 --> 35:05.760]  just move the iPhone to USB-C and then everything's USB-C, you know, I see the sense of that argument.
[35:05.760 --> 35:09.260]  I don't think they're going to do it, but I see the sense of it. I see the desire for
[35:09.260 --> 35:12.920]  me to not have those cables, but I think that's, that's a little early for them to do that
[35:12.920 --> 35:19.400]  given their install base. Yeah, it's, but it, I will say though that I need, it is weird.
[35:19.400 --> 35:25.120]  A USB-C on one end and lightning on the other cable is really weird because USB-C and lightning
[35:25.120 --> 35:29.340]  are so similar in terms, you know, if you really look at it, you can see that USB-C
[35:29.340 --> 35:33.840]  is quite a bit bigger, but that's a weird cable because it, it sort of seems like, why
[35:33.840 --> 35:37.720]  are they different? You know, why shouldn't they, they, they should both be the same,
[35:37.720 --> 35:44.200]  but they're not the same. Yeah. Well, it's right, right now as of the, whatever, um,
[35:44.200 --> 35:49.120]  what's it been now probably 18 hours that I've had this in my life. It feels like, uh,
[35:49.120 --> 35:53.940]  we have a new family member who we dearly love, uh, and it's very important to our household,
[35:53.940 --> 35:58.520]  but it's not simply just too tall for the house we live in, but maybe a different shape
[35:58.520 --> 36:01.940]  than most human beings. And we're going to have to find a way to accommodate that. This
[36:01.940 --> 36:05.920]  is not the end of the world and we represent a little bit of an edge case because what,
[36:05.920 --> 36:09.840]  what are you really looking at? Most people, most people who own an iPhone, especially
[36:09.840 --> 36:13.560]  if they bought it, this is, this is coming straight out of my ass, but like I would guess
[36:13.560 --> 36:20.240]  that most people who are iPhone users who bought an iPhone in the last two to four years
[36:20.240 --> 36:26.320]  primarily, if you should have had a pie graph of their usage, it would be a vast majority
[36:26.320 --> 36:32.160]  would be a big ass iPhone with a lightning cable, right? I mean, how many people have
[36:32.160 --> 36:36.280]  an iPad and a laptop and an iPhone? There's certainly some, but I think we've got a little
[36:36.280 --> 36:42.040]  bit of a, I don't know, bias on like the people we roll with in the same way that like I,
[36:42.040 --> 36:46.440]  you know, I'm currently becoming very interested in how much people actually use iPads for
[36:46.440 --> 36:51.320]  real non-media jobs. And it's been super interesting. Federico has been doing the same thing. It's
[36:51.320 --> 36:55.800]  very interesting to get feedback from people who have real big boy jobs and use iPads,
[36:55.800 --> 36:59.320]  but it would be really easy for us to say like, well, you know, I have this problem.
[36:59.320 --> 37:02.600]  Why don't you, why doesn't everybody fix this? And like, well, think about Apple, think about
[37:02.600 --> 37:06.720]  scale. Like you got to think about people all over the world needing to make those changes
[37:06.720 --> 37:11.280]  at the, at the same time. And that's, that's a, that's a big ask. I think it's weird. And
[37:11.280 --> 37:16.920]  it's funny cause you know, new iPads come out and the new iPad pro is a more interesting
[37:16.920 --> 37:22.480]  device to write about then like eight months ago or whatever it was when the quote unquote
[37:22.480 --> 37:28.560]  regular iPads were updated, you know, cause the regular iPads are mostly about price.
[37:28.560 --> 37:33.500]  It is about being able to sell them for like 350 bucks. And so there's no technology in
[37:33.500 --> 37:38.560]  it that's new and interesting. It's just, here's a really nice iPad that's, you know,
[37:38.560 --> 37:42.460]  two or three years behind the cutting edge and it sells for a lower price so that as
[37:42.460 --> 37:47.820]  a reviewer and a nerd, the pro is a way more interesting to write about. But there is a
[37:47.820 --> 37:53.880]  part of me this week writing my review and talking to other people and reading the other
[37:53.880 --> 37:59.980]  reviews that is like, here we go again. I know that everybody, you know, talking about
[37:59.980 --> 38:06.440]  this whole, can you do your work on the iPad and why not just get a laptop, blah, blah,
[38:06.440 --> 38:11.680]  blah. Everybody, everybody can go on for thousands of words on this. Everybody can do an hour
[38:11.680 --> 38:16.840]  on their podcast about this and we, it seems like we never get anywhere, right? Like there's
[38:16.840 --> 38:22.400]  a part of me that I, it's mostly different from politics because the, the kind of, uh,
[38:22.400 --> 38:26.280]  suddenly I've really been thinking about and prepping for this is like how often the thing
[38:26.280 --> 38:30.280]  that we're doing, it's just the most obvious thing in the world. How much we're saying,
[38:30.280 --> 38:34.280]  yeah, but what about me? Like what about the way I think about this? And that becomes a
[38:34.280 --> 38:39.040]  form, that becomes your form of argumentation, right? Is where your form of perceived persuasion
[38:39.040 --> 38:43.560]  when, you know, that's not, that's not how everybody else thinks about it. Yeah. I thought,
[38:43.560 --> 38:48.080]  uh, I didn't, you know, I still have a bunch of tabs open with a bunch of these reviews
[38:48.080 --> 38:52.340]  cause it was so busy. It was a crazy week. It's just crazy doing an iPad pro review and
[38:52.340 --> 38:57.160]  a Mac book. It's a lot. I mean, especially coming on the heels of the tennis. It's, it's
[38:57.160 --> 39:02.280]  a lot. Um, but you know, I read some of them and you know, Joanna Stern is always a favorite
[39:02.280 --> 39:08.760]  of mine and I really enjoyed her Mac book air review. Um, she didn't do the iPad pro
[39:08.760 --> 39:12.800]  though. Her colleague at the wall street journal, David Pierce did a lot of these people who
[39:12.800 --> 39:17.820]  work at real publications only had to review one of the products that it was like me and
[39:17.820 --> 39:25.940]  Jason Snell I think who poor, poor Jason. Jason did, uh, I think he did all three. I
[39:25.940 --> 39:31.040]  know he'd read, I know he did Mac mini iPad, iPad. Yeah. So on, um, on upgrade they talked
[39:31.040 --> 39:37.140]  about the laptop and the mini, but they're holding off the iPad till next week I think.
[39:37.140 --> 39:41.360]  But uh, so what was the, the, the wall street journal guys? David Pierce, David Pierce.
[39:41.360 --> 39:46.120]  He used to be at, I think he was at wired for a while and then he's like one of these
[39:46.120 --> 39:53.480]  guys can't hold the job. Uh, he was at the verge back in the day. Uh, I joke, but it's,
[39:53.480 --> 39:58.440]  it's funny when you're inside this, there's just a lot of movement in these jobs. People,
[39:58.440 --> 40:03.600]  you know, people are bouncing around, especially after they pivoted to video. Right? Exactly.
[40:03.600 --> 40:08.320]  It's true. It is true. A lot of grenades are still rolling around. Um, thanks Facebook.
[40:08.320 --> 40:14.920]  But his review was, I thought, I thought it was fair and I think that it was very honest
[40:14.920 --> 40:21.680]  from his perspective, but it was, if there's a, there's a trend in these, it's, it is iPad
[40:21.680 --> 40:28.440]  reviews that say you can't replace your laptop with this. You're a good buddy in the light
[40:28.440 --> 40:32.320]  Patel. Well, well, but I thought neil eyes was a better take on this cause I thought
[40:32.320 --> 40:37.120]  that with pierces, I thought that it, it's a common problem where he's using the second
[40:37.120 --> 40:43.480]  person you, when he really means first person him, you know, I can't replace my laptop with
[40:43.480 --> 40:49.880]  an iPad and that's where I am personally. Me personally, John Gruber, I really feel
[40:49.880 --> 40:54.880]  like if I needed to do work and I don't even do video, I don't even do video on my review.
[40:54.880 --> 40:59.000]  So, you know, and I don't do a lot of photography. Uh, and you have somebody else out of your
[40:59.000 --> 41:04.400]  podcast. Yeah, yeah, I do. Honestly, honestly. I mean, you're not sitting there in fair right
[41:04.400 --> 41:08.320]  on a plane, but there's a couple of scenarios, immediate, you know, people who do video editing
[41:08.320 --> 41:12.360]  and audio editing, there's a lot of those are the people who are saying, look, I can't,
[41:12.360 --> 41:19.640]  my workflow can't move from the Mac to iOS or, or if it does, it requires so much fiddliness
[41:19.640 --> 41:25.320]  that it's not worth it. Uh, I'm not there, but even me, I just feel like I always, you
[41:25.320 --> 41:30.640]  know, my analogy is I just feel like I've put mittens on at times and I'm trying to,
[41:30.640 --> 41:34.960]  I'm trying to use this thing with a pair of mittens covering both hands. And if I could,
[41:34.960 --> 41:38.720]  you know, switching to a Mac book would be like taking the mittens off. That's just me.
[41:38.720 --> 41:42.320]  But I try to keep it in mind at all times that this is a very first person thing for
[41:42.320 --> 41:48.040]  me and I see other people who are doing amazing amounts of work on their iPad and really liking
[41:48.040 --> 41:52.480]  it. And so, you know, I try not to get into it, but I felt like pierces was more about
[41:52.480 --> 41:56.720]  his specific needs and his scenarios were things like, well, not everybody has to do
[41:56.720 --> 42:00.480]  that. And whereas I thought neil eyes was a, was a better take neil eyes take at the
[42:00.480 --> 42:05.600]  verge was, uh, was really generous. Well, and just really interesting. And I, you know,
[42:05.600 --> 42:11.240]  like he mentioned specifically, um, that, you know, and I think it sticks out like a
[42:11.240 --> 42:16.860]  sore thumb that, that, okay, we've switched to USB-C and you could take a USB-C like thumb
[42:16.860 --> 42:21.720]  drive that you can't put the, yeah, yeah, yeah. You can stick it in the iPad. Like,
[42:21.720 --> 42:24.820]  and I, why in the world wouldn't it come up in files? It's the single most obvious thing
[42:24.820 --> 42:28.460]  in the world, right? I don't, and I don't think that it should, you know, like the moment
[42:28.460 --> 42:34.160]  you plug it in that it should pop up automatically and put something in your face and take over
[42:34.160 --> 42:38.960]  your screen. Like if you had a copy of Trent, almost like if you had a copy of transmit
[42:38.960 --> 42:44.280]  on your Mac and it couldn't see files on the computer. Yeah. It's just, well, no, I can't
[42:44.280 --> 42:46.880]  really FTP if I can't get to my stuff. And you're like, well, that's not really what
[42:46.880 --> 42:51.280]  it's for. It's forgetting, it's forgetting to remote directories. And there is, I thought
[42:51.280 --> 42:57.760]  like new eyes review kind of got to where Apple is trying to have it both ways. So Adobe's
[42:57.760 --> 43:06.060]  stuff featured very heavily in their iPad pro, uh, demos during the event in their demos
[43:06.060 --> 43:10.760]  in the hands on area last week after the event and in some of the promotional stuff that
[43:10.760 --> 43:15.480]  they are talking about. But they, you know, and rightly so that they, you know, this like
[43:15.480 --> 43:21.980]  the Photoshop for iPad looks amazing. Lightroom on the iPad is right now cause the Photoshop
[43:21.980 --> 43:27.000]  at least is you could at least put an asterisk cause it's coming in 2019. You know, there's
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.440]  like the verge has access to the beta right now. It works. It's definitely, you know,
[43:31.440 --> 43:36.280]  close enough to shipping where it's, it's, it's usable, but it's clearly a beta, but
[43:36.280 --> 43:42.120]  Lightroom is a real thing for the iPad right now. Um, and I mentioned that they had these
[43:42.120 --> 43:48.120]  photos by, uh, Austin man who was there at the event and at the hands on area and he
[43:48.120 --> 43:52.520]  was, he shot these photos, you know, I forget where he was, you know, he travels, he's seriously
[43:52.520 --> 44:00.760]  like he and his wife are like a mini national geographic, um, 50 megapixel images from this
[44:00.760 --> 44:08.320]  amazing looking Hasselblad Hasselblad camera. And Lightroom just goes through and he's sitting
[44:08.320 --> 44:12.040]  there and he's, you know, it's not like if I were doing it, it's like, well, I'll just
[44:12.040 --> 44:15.560]  care, make it look black and white. I mean, this is a professional photographer with great
[44:15.560 --> 44:19.800]  eye and he's adjusting and he's dehazing, you know, like the dehazing is actually, have
[44:19.800 --> 44:24.880]  you looked at this in? No, I haven't. It's like, it's magic. It's like, so if there's
[44:24.880 --> 44:29.560]  something that requires like maybe not AI, but it requires some inference about what
[44:29.560 --> 44:34.240]  constitutes haze. Yeah, it is. I think it is AI. I don't know. And Adobe has this anti,
[44:34.240 --> 44:38.440]  you know, Adobe has figured it out and it's amazing. So you have this image and it kind
[44:38.440 --> 44:41.760]  of looks cool, but then you dehaze it and it's like, oh my God, I can't believe that's
[44:41.760 --> 44:46.720]  the same image. Wow. But anyway, all of these things happen instantaneously, which makes
[44:46.720 --> 44:52.120]  it look like either these were tiny little thumbnail images, you know, just, you know,
[44:52.120 --> 44:58.040]  2000 by 2000 pixels or something, not 50 megapixel or that these results were pre-rendered and
[44:58.040 --> 45:01.520]  you're tapping these things and you know, here's all these pre-rendered results you can
[45:01.520 --> 45:07.360]  flip through, but no, it's all happening live on 50 megapixel raw images. It, it truly as
[45:07.360 --> 45:13.000]  a computer, it is truly a phenomenal device in terms of, you know, mega flops, whatever,
[45:13.000 --> 45:16.560]  you know, whatever you want to say about speed is incredibly fast and it is doing things
[45:16.560 --> 45:23.480]  that you just have no expectation that it would be that fast. And again, it wasn't why
[45:23.480 --> 45:27.600]  Apple set it up. I mentioned this on my show last week, but they had a 15 inch Mac book
[45:27.600 --> 45:34.040]  pro next door. And the reason they had it there was to show you the Adobe CC lifestyle
[45:34.040 --> 45:38.920]  where you can make these changes on one device and it all goes through the creative cloud.
[45:38.920 --> 45:43.040]  And here you can see the same image and the same changes you made instantly sync over
[45:43.040 --> 45:46.800]  to this other device. But the thing I did on this Mac book pro, which is, you know,
[45:46.800 --> 45:51.600]  loaded to the gills is probably like a $6,000 Mac book pro is open the same image and just
[45:51.600 --> 45:57.040]  pinch to zoom. And it wasn't slow, but it wasn't like butter smooth. And it's like,
[45:57.040 --> 46:01.480]  so the iPad is blowing away. It butter smooth when you pinch to zoom on the iPad with these
[46:01.480 --> 46:08.280]  gigantic, ginormous images. Yeah. But yet what Neil, I pointed out is that the workflow
[46:08.280 --> 46:12.400]  of getting images into Lightroom on the iPad is kind of ridiculous because when you plug
[46:12.400 --> 46:21.660]  in a camera or a SD card reader, the only app that can deal with it is the photos app.
[46:21.660 --> 46:27.280]  And so you, it's like built into the system. So the photos app recognizes it and appears
[46:27.280 --> 46:32.520]  and says, Oh, okay, I see you've plugged in a camera. Would you like me to import? Oh,
[46:32.520 --> 46:36.320]  that's so interesting. Cause yeah, I mean, I guess in some ways, in some ways that absolutely
[46:36.320 --> 46:39.760]  makes sense. Cause what else would you want to put it in unless you're getting into a
[46:39.760 --> 46:43.040]  world where you've got stuff. So how do you get it? How do you get Lightroom gift to put
[46:43.040 --> 46:48.000]  into files first? Yeah, what? No, you have to put it, you go into photos and then somehow
[46:48.000 --> 46:53.080]  you've got to import from photos into Lightroom and, and like Neil, I pointed this out to
[46:53.080 --> 46:59.040]  Apple and Apple said, well, you know, and he said very proudly that Adobe is publishing
[46:59.040 --> 47:05.180]  a series shortcut that will import images from the photo, the system camera roll into
[47:05.180 --> 47:10.120]  Lightroom and delete those images from the camera roll. So they're not sitting there
[47:10.120 --> 47:15.360]  taking up your, your camera roll. It's accomplished through a series shortcut and ended this shortcut
[47:15.360 --> 47:22.160]  isn't out yet. Okay. Right. But it's like that is, that is ridiculous though. It's like,
[47:22.160 --> 47:26.000]  watch it run and stuff like it's like in a regular series shortcut. It just seems like
[47:26.000 --> 47:30.300]  a ridiculous word. So Rube Goldberg, right? It's like the real, the better way, the more
[47:30.300 --> 47:34.640]  direct way to do it is to import on a Mac first and then just open your iPad and have
[47:34.640 --> 47:39.320]  them appear through the cloud. But that doesn't, that's not the message. The message isn't
[47:39.320 --> 47:44.320]  well for first step, go to a Mac, right? Like, right. That's one of those things. Like when
[47:44.320 --> 47:49.760]  step one is go to a Mac, you really knew they blew it. Yeah. It's right. When your Mac is
[47:49.760 --> 47:54.040]  your stylist, like you've got, I've got to go. Yeah. I, yeah. It's interesting cause
[47:54.040 --> 47:58.960]  you're pointing out something that's so interesting, which is like you show capabilities in these
[47:58.960 --> 48:03.640]  demos, right? And God, I wish I could remember it was a John Hicks was talked about this
[48:03.640 --> 48:07.960]  app that he was using on iPad was 20 bucks and I bought it last night and I was trying
[48:07.960 --> 48:13.080]  to find the name of it, but it's this astonishing new drawing app with vectors and layers and
[48:13.080 --> 48:15.840]  it is, I opened it up and I just closed it cause it was freaking me out so much. It's
[48:15.840 --> 48:19.520]  incredible what this thing can do layers and layers and layers and layers and layers. I'll
[48:19.520 --> 48:24.120]  find it for show notes. And so you certainly, you show off those sort of capabilities where
[48:24.120 --> 48:27.160]  you go like, okay, you know, if we added this down, you said, this is the thing that you
[48:27.160 --> 48:31.000]  can do. And you're like, wow, that's really cool. But then you're like, Hmm, can we, how
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.680]  does that scale up? Like if we want to really do that. And in the case of something David
[48:34.680 --> 48:39.520]  Sparks used to talk about years ago before iCloud syncing got good, like, are you going
[48:39.520 --> 48:46.400]  to trust, you know, the early versions of iCloud sync to hold your career as an attorney
[48:46.400 --> 48:49.480]  where that, that, that is now something he can do. They have scaled that up and that
[48:49.480 --> 48:53.520]  now works and you can have folders and it works across all the things. But once again,
[48:53.520 --> 48:57.120]  now we're in a funny little in between area where the, yes, this has this capability that
[48:57.120 --> 49:02.520]  curl your hair, but like, you know, good luck this week trying to use that as a professional.
[49:02.520 --> 49:08.280]  Isn't that kind of part of the sticking point? Yeah, I don't know. It just seems, it just
[49:08.280 --> 49:13.760]  seems a little spiteful. I use the word spiteful and it just feels spiteful. It feels like,
[49:13.760 --> 49:17.280]  Oh, come on, this thing is so powerful and here's this USB drive and I know that you
[49:17.280 --> 49:24.640]  speak USB and I can connect them and then nothing happens. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know.
[49:24.640 --> 49:29.560]  I mean, the only part about that that feels, Hmm, I certainly wouldn't say dishonest, but
[49:29.560 --> 49:33.160]  feels a little bit sketchy where you get into the asterisks is like I say, like how you
[49:33.160 --> 49:37.320]  would use this thing in the field, something that our good friend Marco Arment runs against.
[49:37.320 --> 49:40.860]  I just think this is the classic example is like, what do you do with a one port professional
[49:40.860 --> 49:45.200]  computer if you need to record a podcast like you think you live in dongle town now, we'll
[49:45.200 --> 49:49.880]  look, welcome to dongle tropolis cause that's good luck. Even trying to make that happen.
[49:49.880 --> 49:53.480]  Something that seems like it should be so straightforward with a professional laptop
[49:53.480 --> 49:57.260]  at, you know, this is my, my, my, so that, that, that's frustrating when you see the
[49:57.260 --> 50:02.560]  demo of the capability, but then you are, and I'm not Federico, forgive me. I'm not
[50:02.560 --> 50:07.160]  trying to say it is strictly an iOS software problem. There's tons you can do. I keep returning
[50:07.160 --> 50:11.200]  to this one thing. Every time I look at this, yes, this is a thing that is developing. We're
[50:11.200 --> 50:15.480]  still so far ahead of where we were years ago, but with all of this stuff, I still am
[50:15.480 --> 50:20.720]  always, I've become very sensitive to looking for the old man part of this. Yeah. And it's
[50:20.720 --> 50:24.180]  not always, it's not always germane. Sometimes it is that Apple's just being stubborn or
[50:24.180 --> 50:27.040]  they're not ready to release this cause it's not good enough for whatever it is or maybe
[50:27.040 --> 50:31.640]  they're being spiteful. Who knows? But I do try to always find the old man part in all
[50:31.640 --> 50:36.140]  of this. Am I being an old man here? The same kind of people who are like, you know, well
[50:36.140 --> 50:40.920]  think about when we, when you first got, you know, power books and, and, and, or, you know,
[50:40.920 --> 50:44.560]  or any kind of like a laptop, the people who just let alone that it was a Mac laptop, they
[50:44.560 --> 50:49.240]  just thought you were so silly. You'll never be, you, you're a child. You, that might as
[50:49.240 --> 50:53.200]  well say Fisher price on it. And now, I mean, and the truth was you could do a fair amount
[50:53.200 --> 50:57.240]  then and you can do even more now because that's how it works. But you and I both have
[50:57.240 --> 51:02.280]  people who live in our household that we can look to for how a non old person looks at
[51:02.280 --> 51:07.000]  this stuff. And I try to never miss an opportunity, even when they're doing a quote unquote wrong.
[51:07.000 --> 51:12.640]  I try to look to that. And I do think this is super valuable because how can I put this?
[51:12.640 --> 51:16.680]  I don't have a smart way to say this, but you know, however we arrive where we are in
[51:16.680 --> 51:21.040]  feeling that we have expertise with something. Even if you can demonstrate that expertise,
[51:21.040 --> 51:25.720]  you can prove that expertise. You can, in fact, I'm talking to expertise in a job, not
[51:25.720 --> 51:29.640]  just with a given technical skill, right? But there are people, you know, who are crazy
[51:29.640 --> 51:34.420]  smart and experienced who have gotten somehow let's for a minute, avoid how they got there,
[51:34.420 --> 51:39.000]  but we can take it as read that this person really knows their stuff in their sort of
[51:39.000 --> 51:44.160]  domain, the work that they do and the tools that they use in order to achieve it. Right?
[51:44.160 --> 51:47.160]  I mean, we can certainly look at people like that now. Now what's interesting about that
[51:47.160 --> 51:51.040]  is some of the skills are things we started learning. Think about the skills we started
[51:51.040 --> 51:55.080]  learning in the eighties and nineties and the problems that we were going to solve with
[51:55.080 --> 52:01.920]  those skills, the tools that were available to us both educationally and professionally.
[52:01.920 --> 52:06.640]  I guess what I'm trying to say is that is, is it not possible that there will be a path
[52:06.640 --> 52:11.680]  to expertise in the future that doesn't take the same precise winding road you and I took.
[52:11.680 --> 52:14.920]  And I think we always have to keep that in mind. So when I look at somebody sitting in
[52:14.920 --> 52:21.680]  a Starbucks typing on the keyboard of an iPad and I'm like, Oh God, that looks, I can't
[52:21.680 --> 52:27.540]  do that. That is brutal. There's no key travel. Like how, how are you doing that? And yet
[52:27.540 --> 52:33.120]  look at how many people that are under 25 are totally happy to type on an iPad. Right.
[52:33.120 --> 52:36.440]  And so somebody like you and me, like we all, you got to have your DOS keyboard, like, Oh,
[52:36.440 --> 52:39.520]  what are you or your, in your case, your extended keyboard, I guess I'm just trying to say like,
[52:39.520 --> 52:44.160]  I think we have to, I think it's important to keep in mind that that long winding road
[52:44.160 --> 52:50.320]  to expertise success via experience is, does not have to take the same shape that we did
[52:50.320 --> 52:54.640]  in order for people to be successful. I realize I'm beating this into the ground, except this
[52:54.640 --> 52:58.360]  is something I so struggle with. And I've talked to Syracuse about this at length on
[52:58.360 --> 53:02.240]  reconcilable differences, but my kid's sitting there with her Chromebook, doing her homework
[53:02.240 --> 53:07.080]  and Google docs. And I'm like, Oh my God, you're doing everything so wrong. Just stop
[53:07.080 --> 53:11.240]  using the touch pad for everything. Learn the commands. But you know, she hasn't died.
[53:11.240 --> 53:15.840]  She hasn't exploded yet. She's learning as she goes, but her path to whatever comes in
[53:15.840 --> 53:21.060]  her future must necessarily take a different path than, than, than I took. And I really
[53:21.060 --> 53:24.360]  try to keep that in mind. It's not an excuse for saying like, Hey, it'd be great if the
[53:24.360 --> 53:28.660]  capabilities demonstrated here were supported by an infrastructure that makes that scalable
[53:28.660 --> 53:32.560]  for professionals. But I think we also have to watch the way the wind is blowing. I'm
[53:32.560 --> 53:36.560]  carrying on, but do you kind of get what I'm saying? Yeah, I do. I, you know, but then
[53:36.560 --> 53:41.040]  there's other problems where it, there is no new way. Like if the problem, like I was
[53:41.040 --> 53:46.840]  talking to the verge guys after the event, you know, uh, you know, in the media area
[53:46.840 --> 53:50.280]  and they were, they were just saying like, look, look at our scenario. There's like three
[53:50.280 --> 53:55.180]  or four of them. Uh, they're shooting with a standalone camera. They've got all this
[53:55.180 --> 54:00.440]  video footage and you know, these guys turn out the video like immediately like they go
[54:00.440 --> 54:05.080]  up, they rush into the hands on area, they shoot some, what do they call it? Like B roll
[54:05.080 --> 54:10.320]  footage and you know, they're shooting footage of the new iPad pro shots of people like holding
[54:10.320 --> 54:16.160]  the iPad from different angles. Meanwhile, like maybe neil is, is, is writing his narration
[54:16.160 --> 54:19.960]  for it and then they, you know, within, you know, by like one o'clock in the afternoon,
[54:19.960 --> 54:23.680]  Eastern time, they've got like a video up on their site, uh, you know, like a nice little
[54:23.680 --> 54:30.640]  four minute, very professional video, um, that gets tens of thousands of views immediately.
[54:30.640 --> 54:34.480]  Um, and, and they were like, well, how do you know, how would we do this on an iPad?
[54:34.480 --> 54:39.480]  We've got all of this video footage, we've got a recording of audio, we, we need it,
[54:39.480 --> 54:45.480]  you know, we need a USB microphone to get, you know, good quality audio for the narration.
[54:45.480 --> 54:50.720]  How do we do, how would we, if I've got, you know, this four K video here and we need it
[54:50.720 --> 54:54.960]  there on your machine cause you're the one who's going to edit it. How do we move this
[54:54.960 --> 55:00.520]  big, you know, multi gigabyte video over there with, if you don't have USB reader, I mean
[55:00.520 --> 55:05.620]  that's a, the sneaker net problem has still never gone away. Like, cause eventually you're
[55:05.620 --> 55:10.720]  going to run into something where the files are big enough where you can't reliably shoot
[55:10.720 --> 55:12.920]  them over the air at each other.
[55:12.920 --> 55:20.200]  Yeah. And I don't know, I guess, I guess I would look at that and I don't know. I mean,
[55:20.200 --> 55:24.480]  has Apple implicitly promised that you won't need backs anymore? Cause I don't know. I
[55:24.480 --> 55:27.160]  don't feel like that's on the table at all. I think what they're saying is we're getting
[55:27.160 --> 55:32.920]  you right. I mean, not, not, not to go back to, I like Syracuse, I think automobile analogies
[55:32.920 --> 55:37.480]  often fall short, but there are times when the car versus truck analogy does make a lot
[55:37.480 --> 55:44.440]  of sense I think. But yeah, I mean like any, in any profession you choose the tools that
[55:44.440 --> 55:48.600]  you need and like to use and work best for you and you get great at them. And in that
[55:48.600 --> 55:52.600]  case, yeah, that's, that's the place where they got room to improve for sure. For sure.
[55:52.600 --> 55:57.200]  It's I mean, I don't know, I don't know what the next step looks like. I would love to
[55:57.200 --> 56:05.200]  be a fly on the wall to see what iOS as an interface looks like in the next two years.
[56:05.200 --> 56:09.400]  I think it's really fascinating to think about where they're going to go next. This, this
[56:09.400 --> 56:14.920]  device, this new iPad I've got is now fast enough that I, for the first time, it doesn't
[56:14.920 --> 56:20.280]  feel onerous to create, what was the technical name for it when you drag a drag over to the
[56:20.280 --> 56:25.840]  right and you pull up a second app. What does that, what is that called? I don't know. I
[56:25.840 --> 56:30.680]  don't know what you mean. I don't use it much cause it's kind of a pain. Honestly, it's,
[56:30.680 --> 56:34.920]  this is one area where they can show, this is the, so let's go back to this earlier thing.
[56:34.920 --> 56:38.080]  Let's show some capabilities. Here's a really cool capability. Let's say you're looking
[56:38.080 --> 56:42.200]  at Safari and you want to make some notes for a report that you're doing. So you drag
[56:42.200 --> 56:47.680]  notes up to the right. You can change how wide it is. That's really cool. It's not difficult,
[56:47.680 --> 56:51.640]  but it's not crazy easy and it's certainly not crazy fast. And if it's not already in
[56:51.640 --> 56:54.700]  the doc, you're going to need to do, do you remember the theatrics you would have to do
[56:54.700 --> 56:58.640]  with two fingers to get stuff up from the doc? I personally did not spend a ton of time
[56:58.640 --> 57:02.200]  on it. I don't even know the name of it. It's like, just don't use it that much. I believe
[57:02.200 --> 57:06.840]  to a certainty there are people who do. Um, what I noticed last night, I just, for fun
[57:06.840 --> 57:11.040]  I said, Oh, I'll just grab this thing from the doc and pull it over. Talk about butter
[57:11.040 --> 57:15.680]  smooth. That worked great. But the basic concept of how you get to stuff that's not in the
[57:15.680 --> 57:20.280]  doc is still not surpassingly pretty. And I don't know what that's going to look like,
[57:20.280 --> 57:23.400]  let alone how we're going to see all the pipes and wires underneath that in the next two
[57:23.400 --> 57:28.640]  years that would accommodate things like your light room a thing you're talking about. Yeah.
[57:28.640 --> 57:33.500]  And I, I, I wanted to talk about this multitasking thing because again, I don't doubt that there
[57:33.500 --> 57:38.440]  are people who swear by it, but to me it never seems worthwhile and I'll just through observation
[57:38.440 --> 57:43.680]  I can point out, like I said, my wife is an avid iPad user. It is her main computer. She
[57:43.680 --> 57:47.840]  spends more time, like she even gets the reports now, you know, with the screen time, screen
[57:47.840 --> 57:53.360]  time. Yeah. I mean, and you know, her, her, she doesn't use her phone a lot. Uh, she's
[57:53.360 --> 57:59.000]  just not a big phone nerd like I am. My, my phone numbers are gross. You know, it's like
[57:59.000 --> 58:04.840]  200 pickups a day or something. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh, I don't like that number. Well, I don't
[58:04.840 --> 58:10.080]  mind it. I'm not embarrassed by it. Of course. I'm not surprised by it. So it's, you know,
[58:10.080 --> 58:14.640]  it doesn't bother me to look at it. I'm fully accepted that I look at my phone all the time,
[58:14.640 --> 58:18.880]  her iPad numbers are huge. She never uses the multitasking features. She uses it the
[58:18.880 --> 58:23.120]  way the iPad to me was intended all along where it is one thing at a time and it takes
[58:23.120 --> 58:29.200]  up the whole screen. But I also think though that, uh, it is kind of weird. Like, like
[58:29.200 --> 58:33.260]  what do you use for Twitter? Do you, do I use the tweet bot everywhere? Oh, you don't
[58:33.260 --> 58:36.600]  want to know. Okay. Um, when I'm doing stuff for myself, I usually use the Twitter app
[58:36.600 --> 58:43.840]  when I'm doing stuff for my shows. I use tweet bot on, um, on iOS, but it, the 12 point,
[58:43.840 --> 58:49.280]  not very fashionable, but I, I do, I do like some aspects of the regular Twitter app, but
[58:49.280 --> 58:54.240]  yeah, that's, that's pretty much it. I always use tweet bot in a, in a relatively narrow
[58:54.240 --> 58:59.580]  window, like effectively like a phone, you know, whether I'm on a Mac or anywhere else,
[58:59.580 --> 59:05.520]  it's Twitter is a thing to me that goes in a long skinny window. Uh, messages like when
[59:05.520 --> 59:10.040]  I'm messages, it doesn't make a ton of sense. I accidentally hit whichever laws and green,
[59:10.040 --> 59:14.600]  yellow, red laws and makes it fill the screen. I was aghast. It's not good for that. It's
[59:14.600 --> 59:20.520]  just that it, it, yeah, it's not good cause you get like there's, you just get these crazy
[59:20.520 --> 59:25.680]  long lines of texts that are actually unpleasant. You know, there's, there's, there's a reason
[59:25.680 --> 59:31.920]  why books don't have 200 lines of characters, 200 characters per line. It's supposed to
[59:31.920 --> 59:36.760]  be kind of skinny so that the paragraphs wrap to a certain size here. I want it to be about
[59:36.760 --> 59:42.440]  65 karat. And there's no good way. Like when you've got the 12.9 inch iPad in laptop mode,
[59:42.440 --> 59:45.880]  you know, you got it connected to the keyboard. There's no good way to just have your Twitter
[59:45.880 --> 59:50.040]  client be a skinny window. Like you've got to even to make it skinny. You've got to set
[59:50.040 --> 59:55.520]  up a second app to, you know, that may or may not go with it. I don't know. I find the
[59:55.520 --> 01:00:01.040]  whole thing very, very convoluted. I feel like apple has over, I don't know. It's very
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:04.480]  hard for me to express it, but I just can't help but think that they've, it's too clever
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:11.200]  by far. Whereas, Oh, I agree. I, and again, I, it's very important this particular week
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:15.680]  that I make, keep all of my friends and say, yes, I have no doubt at all that there are
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:20.500]  people using multiple sets of multiple windows. But you know, the nice thing is also that
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:23.620]  I feel like there is a, I overuse this phrase. I feel like there's a little bit of a sleeping
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:29.160]  giant out there cause I wonder how much people use extensions. Extensions do so much. There
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:33.240]  are, let's put it, let me put it differently. There are not that many occasions when I need
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:37.080]  to persistently look at two different apps on an iPad. It certainly happens and it's
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:42.120]  convenient, but honestly what I need is a conduit for moving information from one place
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:45.480]  to another. I mean the one thing that's been there for a couple, three years now that I
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:49.240]  think is just dynamite is in your case, you do all your stuff in notes. I do my stuff
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:55.380]  mostly in drafts or um, or the increasingly more abundant elements. But what is great
[01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:59.960]  is if it's getting around holiday or birthday time, I could be looking at the web and I'm
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:04.760]  on a page and Amazon page or whatever page and I can hit that little up arrow and send
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:09.800]  that to the shared note with my wife. It makes a smart card and it drops that in as this
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:13.540]  beautiful clickable thing that we can share now or I could send it to messages or I could
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:18.320]  do whatever. John, I know that extensions is there and I could bet you like street fight
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:23.880]  style. I use extensions more than 80% of other users. I still forget that I don't need to
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:29.080]  copy the URL out of Safari to put it into messages. All I need to do, I mean like if
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.880]  you want to send, send your wife a youtube video, how do you do it right now on your
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:38.200]  phone? Do you use the extension? Yeah, I think I do. Yeah. See, I'm trying to wean myself
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:46.480]  off the copy and paste, but like per 25 minutes ago, that's a very 1991 thing to do. The extensions
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:51.360]  changed the game. So for me, extensions and the swipey at the bottom, I love the swipey
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:56.400]  bottom gesture to get between. That's a terrible, I know exactly what you mean. I love it. But
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:00.080]  the swipey bottom is, is like for me, the way that I get around the swipey uppy to move
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:04.900]  between cards or move between apps. I use those two a lot, but, but they're for two
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:09.820]  very specifically different kinds of things. One is I need to move information from one
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:14.020]  place to another. Try to make yourself remember there's probably an extension for that cause
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:17.800]  it will save you so much time and effort. I'm real good at hitting insta, insta paper
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:22.840]  is my first icon in most of the apps on the left. So I'm always adding stuff to insta
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:26.760]  paper that I occasionally read, but that's really easy to do as far as the moving between
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:30.600]  apps. That's usually because I want to be doing something different now or I want to
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:36.840]  see something different now, but I don't know. I mean the, the demo value of having those
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:41.520]  two apps open at the same time is very high. I just have not find, found that many cases
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:46.680]  where it's worth the effort to make it happen. Do you use command tab on the iPad? Uh, heavily.
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.720]  Yeah. But right now I'm, I've got right now I was talking about what you using external
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:54.680]  keyboard. Yeah. Using it like usually, you know, with the iPad, it's the, the, you know,
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:58.720]  the apple. I've got this thing, uh, had this for years right now sitting on my desk. I
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:02.980]  have the Logitech case seven 60. It's not by any stretch. I have many, many of these
[01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:05.960]  Bluetooth keyboards. This is the one I just happened to keep it work cause it's not as
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:12.700]  loud as my DOS and it's got the dingus where you can hit the different Bluetooth keys to
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:18.640]  move between devices. I just, I feel like people would, their minds would be blown if
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:24.560]  they realize on the one hand how much stuff you can do with a keyboard, like a full feature
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:30.080]  keyboard, not just the folio one, a full feature keyboard on an iPad in particular. And as
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:33.200]  always with these things, then what you end up discovering is you discover how much more
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:37.620]  you wish it could do, but it is very, very powerful. There are apps like, so sometimes
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:43.040]  open up drafts, a recent copy of drafts and hit the show me, show me available keys. What
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:48.680]  is that? I don't even know. Command question mark or whatever. Yeah, he has multiple pages
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:52.120]  that you can do with the keyboard and dress. You have to go to pages to see all the stuff
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:56.540]  you can do to answer your question. Yes, that I use that a lot by and large, especially
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:04:00.920]  with the smaller one. I mostly use it in my hands right now. I have the big boy sitting
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:04.640]  in front of me and it's a, but I don't you think it's weird. I think it's weird that
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:09.900]  when you're command tabbing in the iPad that when you have two apps multitasking together
[01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:15.600]  side by side in the command tab interface, they're sort of married together. It's, I
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:19.140]  don't know why it just show you how often I do this, so I'm going to go recreate what
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:23.380]  you're talking about right now. It's just a weird thing like, and so if you've got like
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:27.840]  safari on the left and, and like you said, notes on the right because you're taking notes
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:31.240]  about a thing that you're reading and it's helpful to have them side by side, but if
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:34.800]  you just want to keep safari where it is on the left and then replace the thing on the
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:38.920]  right with, oh, if you're focal in the right one, if you're right, the cursor is in the
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.600]  right one and you switch, you think that should change out. I don't know. I don't know what
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:46.260]  they should do. It just seems to me like they should rethink the whole thing. And I know
[01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:54.980]  that there were rumors of a major iPad interface update for iOS 12 that got shelved last year
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:05:02.560]  on the grounds of let's just focus on reliability and you know, making, making the whole system,
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:07.480]  you know, let's, let's punt, punt for a year on these UI changes and just make what we
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:10.760]  have work better, you know, and, and hats off to Apple. You know, there were, oh yes,
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:14.660]  yes, yes. I love those years. I love the S years. Well, I bet that, you know, like I
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:19.520]  remember like when, when I was 12 shipped a month or two ago and people, you know, like
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:25.280]  a couple of reviewers like put it on an older iPhone and indeed it was faster. You know,
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:30.280]  it's like me and my daughter's success. Right. Real, real speedy. Yeah. And so it's, and
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:34.020]  that was great that what they said they were going to do and they did it, but it's, I can't
[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:39.560]  help but hope, I seriously hope that they have really big ideas for the iPad interface
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:44.400]  in terms of multitasking and stuff like that. I, cause I just feel like the way things stand
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:49.300]  right now, it's, I don't know, it just, it still seems to me like the, the native way
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:53.520]  to do everything is just, you know, go to the home screen, tap an icon, have it filled
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:58.800]  the screen, go back to the home screen, you know? Well, and, and so let, let me just throw
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:02.660]  this back at you one more time. Why is that? That's because you probably had some kind
[01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:06.840]  of smartphone in the past, but definitely you fell in love with the iPhone, right? And
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:10.400]  using the iPhone is how you started. I never had a smartphone before the iPhone. I had
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:14.400]  never at all. You always had a feature phone, like a $10, but once you, the point being,
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:18.840]  once you got on an iPhone, you never look back. And so that's like, even to this day,
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:23.160]  there's still things I need to unlearn based on, you know, nine years at that time of using
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:29.960]  an iPhone. It's crazy affinity designer for iPad. Sarah is the name of that app, by the
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:36.040]  way. Those guys are amazing. The affinity people. This thing's crazy. I'll put in notes.
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:44.120]  All right. Well, I just typed it in the note, but whatever. Wait, undo, undo. Oh no. It
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:47.080]  just works here. Let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor. It's our good

[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:03.240]  trial and there's no limits. It's not like you're in like a limited mode or something
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:07.820]  like that. You just go there and start your trial and you got the full power of Squarespace.
[01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:13.360]  You can start with one of their templates, all of their sites, professionally designed,
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:17.560]  regardless of your skill level, no code. If you don't want to see HTML, if you don't know
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:22.380]  the difference between HTML and CSS, that's fine. It doesn't matter. It's all visual.
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:27.800]  If you want it to be a very intuitive, easy to use tools, you make your site, you design
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:32.840]  your site in the browser. It is, you know, you're just in like super mode because you're
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:40.280]  the Squarespace account owner. So what you're looking at is the website you are building.
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:45.240]  Could not be more natural. You just build the website visually. You can, you can do
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:50.220]  everything at Squarespace. You can register the domain name you want. They have their
[01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:54.320]  own analytics package. So once your site is live, you want to see the traffic, you want
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:58.600]  to see where links are coming in from all that stuff. They show it to you. There's a
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:05.360]  great, great analytics dashboard, just super, super good design. One of the best reasons
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:11.320]  to use Squarespace. Honestly, it's one of the best analytics interfaces I've ever seen.
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:16.740]  Everything you want to do design updating it. So if you have a blog as part of your
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:21.360]  site or you want to publish a podcast or something like that, you do it all through Squarespace,
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:26.400]  Squarespace, in addition to being the design tool, also offers the CMS tools to do things
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:31.800]  like posts or episodes or stuff like that. All of it all goes through Squarespace. You'll
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:38.560]  save so much time and it's so professional and you get, it's really, really, you know,
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:42.340]  high capacity. Some, you know, if you get linked to from daring fireball, your site's
[01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:47.480]  not going to go down. It's super, super fast. Everything is good. And can I share this?
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:52.080]  Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. I just want to share something kind of nerdy that literally only
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:56.960]  your listeners would be interested in. I just sent you a link in text to a Squarespace site.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:00.040]  It's not the prettiest cause I haven't updated it lately, but really it's just a ham and
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:05.120]  eggs way for me to share playlists with people. So when I go and I make a playlist, Spotify
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:12.160]  or YouTube, when I remember to, I go in and I put it up, but I don't like using HTML.
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:17.160]  So I just sent you another image that I would like you to look at. So when I want to update
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:24.240]  my page, I don't even use the WYSIWYG. I write everything in markdown in envy alt. I keep
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:28.740]  that in one running file and then I copy and paste that and I just drop it into a big markdown
[01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:32.800]  field and that's how I update the page. I don't know if everybody knows you can do that,
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:36.120]  but if you prefer to work in markdown, it's all right there for you. How cool is that?
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.960]  And that works on Squarespace. Oh yeah, you're seeing this, you're seeing the three octa
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:42.160]  Thorps and that's, that's a heading and like you could just, you just do that. I do that
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:46.720]  locally and you, the WYSIWYG is great, but also you could put in, you can put in a full
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:50.160]  on regular HTML, but it also that you can have a little markdown area where you drag
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:54.240]  the markdown dingus over and you're, and you're good to go. However you want to work, they
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:58.040]  will accommodate that and it is super solid and it looks great on every device, which
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:01.040]  is something I could never do. That's what they used to be a whole career, John, having
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:06.000]  everything look good on every device, like armed, armed with a six months of Linda classes
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.920]  and a clear pixel, you could change the world. Don't need that anymore. You got Squarespace.
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:17.560]  It's really, really great. So you get a free free trial and they got a code special code.
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:23.480]  Go to squarespace.com slash talk show squarespace.com slash talk show and remember that code talk
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:27.880]  show and you'll get 10% off your first purchase. So if you sign up for a year, you can save
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:32.720]  10% off the whole year. But the only, the trick is you got to remember that code because
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:36.300]  you start a free trial. You don't pay right away. You go there, you use this thing for
[01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:39.280]  like a month before they'll say, okay, now you have to pay. If you want to keep using
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:43.960]  it, then just keep that. Keep that in your back pocket talk show and you'll save 10%
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:47.320]  it's a great service. So the next time you need a website, look at this. I've put a link
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:53.840]  to this thing in the show notes. Look at this cool site. Merlin has easy to come on, but
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:58.280]  it's made me lazy. It made me lazy. John, what I used to have to do everything by hand
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:02.320]  in movable type, especially I was constantly tweaking and now I'm just like, eh, they'll
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:05.520]  get it. They're gonna look at it on a phone anyway. Like I'm not going to spend tons of
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:09.800]  time on this and that's exactly what I want. What I want is a way to dump information onto
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:14.900]  the web that people can get and I don't spend the rest of my life wondering why the gray
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:20.080]  lines don't match up in Firefox. It's like, ah, thank you. I'm so glad to be out of that
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:25.400]  world. Never looked back. Never looked back. John, I used to think it was fun. It wasn't
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:30.240]  the time and you know, movable type was so great. Every, every website was a house of
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:36.800]  cards where, Oh, 100% and every design you would find that you'd be like, but, but in
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:42.320]  button I E the, the box doesn't, the two lines don't meet in the corner and then you'd fix
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:46.940]  it and then you'd go back and it was suddenly broken everywhere. I forgot to manually assign
[01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:55.680]  a font face to every cell in the table. What? That's how we used to live. Miserable table
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:00.480]  layouts. Oh my God. Well, you get every, well, you remember every TD, your time was, if you
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:04.280]  wanted to look at a Netscape, every TD, if you wanted to use style sheets like some kind
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:08.400]  of nut from the future, you had to have font face equals every one of those in order for
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:16.080]  it to render correctly. Nice, nice lean code. It was funny though, because with table layouts
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:22.360]  they did, they, they were more likely to look the same everywhere. Like when we switched
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:25.800]  and seen it changed the game, seen it changed everything. Like, wait a minute, wait, wait,
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:30.880]  wait. Just the left side of the page. Yellow. How did you do that? You've solved my yellow
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:34.680]  background riddle. All right, so you bought the whole kit with this iPad. You got, you
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:42.520]  got, you got your iPad. How many gigabytes did you buy? I went with shame on Apple for
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:47.880]  these levels. I went with five 12 because you wanted, well, what do you think? Cause
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:53.760]  like 100 movies. Right? There's a lot every time. John, every time I say now this is going
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:58.720]  to be the one I keep in use for five years. Every time I tell myself you got treat yourself
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:03.200]  right. Like you gotta, you gotta get the good one, right? I bought the, uh, what's the maximum
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:07.600]  for the iPhone five 12 I think that max for iPhone is five 12 and I bought that cause
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:12.880]  I've always bought. I did too, but I seriously started doing a math on how much like 4k video
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:17.960]  I would need to shoot before it even came close. And it, it really is sort of a waste
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:22.320]  of money. I really, it's like I forget how much storage I'm using, especially with the
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:28.340]  iCloud photos thing where once if you're, you know, and I'm all in on the iCloud photo,
[01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:32.760]  so I don't need my whole photo library local on the phone. It won't crack it. I don't even
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:36.720]  want it. So I, I really don't know why I bought the big iPhone. I'm still, I'm still running
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:41.580]  into friends and I mean I get this in my own family where I'm supposed to be the CTO and
[01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:45.480]  taking care of everything. And I'm like, I'll just be like, honey, you, you haven't, you
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:50.640]  haven't updated your OS or plugged in your iPad in like weeks. Like it's, everything's,
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:54.120]  you're signed out of everything. Like what is happening? But then you go and you get
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:57.440]  all signed in and everything. And like I still run into this, not so much in our household,
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:01.840]  but in, I will still encounter people. Uh, I haven't seen this one in a while, but you
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:07.600]  remember it was even fairly recently that people wouldn't be able to update their OS
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:11.200]  because they were out of room. Yes, yes, yes. That was, that couldn't have been more than
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:14.640]  two or three years ago. It was a big problem. It was a big problem when they were selling
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:20.840]  16 gigabyte devices because that's right. Because a significant portion of your 16 gigabytes
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:25.160]  was the OS, you know, the OS was five, six gigabytes. So you really, you didn't have
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:30.740]  much. Whereas if you buy even at 64 even if, you know, which is now like the small size,
[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:36.080]  the fact that the OS takes up four gigabytes, it's most of that 64 is still your space.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:41.480]  It's just wasn't the case with 16 and yeah, that, that's a weird problem to be in. You
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:45.760]  don't have enough room. You have to delete. That's so, it's so, but they have it from
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:49.280]  like what, five different angles, three different angles. They've, they've addressed that with
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:56.080]  the offloading. Um, you either need to delete photos of your daughter or yeah. Or how much
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:03.000]  do I want, how much do I want to not get hacked or I'm going to need a minute, right? Let's
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.520]  get that up though, buddy. Woo. Are you, what do you, when you shoot video, just out of
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:12.680]  curiosity, when you shoot video on your, you're on a tennis. Yep. Uh, what do you see? No,
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:17.200]  I had been on, I'm not sure why I was on Peter Jackson settings. I used to be on, I think
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:25.160]  I was at 10 80 at 60 but then I heard the HDR only works on 30 or so I switched back.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:30.720]  Yeah, right. That HDR is pretty bananas. We've combined in the first shot. The thing I shot
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:35.960]  like that, I did the auto HDR and I think it was the first thing I shot on a phone that
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:41.920]  was shooting in stereo as well. Yeah. And I was, uh, I'm not gonna say I like fell over,
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:47.600]  but I was like, wow, that the two of those things together was surprising. Real surprisingly
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:53.120]  realistic. The HDR, the auto HDR for, I mean I was shooting straight at the sun. So like
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:56.840]  in San Francisco you get a lot of fog and some sun and like it, you know, it looked
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:01.080]  a little, little tricky and gamey, but it worked and it sounded just the sound of me
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:06.440]  like walking down the street sounded amazing. I've, I've been shooting a four K 24 frames
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:15.400]  per second upgrade. I wish that it was easier to switch though. Um, like I kind of, I get
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:21.160]  it, you know, I, I do think that Apple's camera UI team is one of the best teams they have.
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:25.800]  The verge even had a story recently about how it's like the, the camera app UI design
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:31.320]  from iOS seven going forward, like when they went to the new style, it's like the most
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:37.320]  influential UI design of the last 10 years because everybody copies it. And you know,
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:40.680]  part of it is the shamelessness with, with, with some of these Chinese companies will
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:48.520]  just copy anything. Um, a little pop up with the fake AirPods. What are they called? Uh,
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:55.720]  Q pods or like ear earbud or something like that. Fly pods, fly pods, fly pods, fly pods.
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:00.520]  Yeah. Um, but part of it is that it's such a good design and once you've seen it, you
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:07.800]  can't unsee it. Uh, and I get it. And my God, is there an app that, that on the, on the
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:13.800]  entire phone that more people use than the camera app? I mean, even with like, I guess
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:17.720]  messages maybe. I mean, everybody uses messages, but there's some parts of the world where
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:21.640]  people, because they don't use text or I message, there's some parts of the world where even
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:26.680]  iPhone users are using, if I had to name this today, uh, you know, 10 years, 11 years on,
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:29.800]  I would, I would call this, I would say this is a camera that happens to have a phone,
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:34.840]  right? It's absolutely true. But, and most people use the system camera app and even
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:39.000]  like an expert, you know, like there's like the halide, if you know what halide is, halide
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.600]  is correct. Halide is worth spending some time with. I know you're, I know you're a
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:46.200]  stock camera guy, but if you have some time and you know you're going to be able to get
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:51.160]  everything the way you want, halide is crazy. I love it. The control you get in Halide is
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:56.760]  nuts. But even if you use halide for all of your photos, halide only does photos, it doesn't
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:00.920]  do video. So you're still going to the system app to shoot video. I get it that they, you
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:05.960]  know, they're trying to, you know, they're trying to keep it as usable as possible for,
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:12.200]  you know, those 800 million people who aren't camera nerds yet still give, have some features
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:16.440]  in there that are as powerful as possible. So I get it why you can't switch the video
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:21.320]  format in the camera app, you know, that you've got to go to settings and then camera and
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:25.720]  then shoot video. It's, it's not the worst thing in the world, but when you're right
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:30.840]  there in the camera, ready to shoot something and like, for example, I was, I shot a little
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:36.920]  bit of video, I don't even know why, but I've shot a little bit of video inside the, the
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:40.600]  theater at last week's event while we were waiting, you know, everybody taking their
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:48.360]  seats and it was very dark. It's a theater, you know, but it's 20 at, at 4k it was, it
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:53.080]  was actually so little light that it wasn't exposing the video. Right. You know, so I
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:57.880]  wanted to switch to 10 80, which would, would let, you know, the video was, it was, it was
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:02.200]  usually you got to do that in settings. Yeah. And it just, yeah, right there in the moment,
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:06.120]  it just felt like, Oh, what a pain in the ass. Switch to settings, poke around, you
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:10.760]  got to scroll down to get to camera. You know, it's, that's true, but that you, so you're
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:14.760]  thinking maybe they don't want it to, they could do some kind of a little left, right
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:20.360]  carousel slider thing. Well, like when you're shooting 24 k 24 frames per second, that there
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:25.880]  is a little thing in the camera app that says, Hey, 24 k 24 frames per second so that you
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:30.280]  know what, what mode you're in. I kind of wish I could just tap on that and then have
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:37.560]  it get a pop up. I get why they don't, but it, you know, and I'm sure the overwhelming
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:41.640]  majority of people have no idea that you can change from the default. You know, they just
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:47.400]  shoot the settings by the settings. I have one thing to say about settings. I have lots
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:50.840]  of things to say about settings. My one piece of advice about settings is start
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:55.800]  scrolling up to down to get the search field. You're going to make your life so much
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:59.640]  better. Like use the search field. Don't click. There's so much stuff in settings and
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:03.560]  it's so bananas. Every time I want to back up, I can't remember when, you know, do I
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:06.920]  have to go to my, what area did I go to for that? No, just to make sure it's backed up
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:10.440]  like I did last night. Just go flip from, you know, you don't talking about how would
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:15.320]  you describe that you're in settings and there's the sections of settings on the left.
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:20.200]  Just drag down a little bit and you'll get a search. I know, you know, this, all of you
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:23.560]  very smart doobies know this, but you'd be amazed how many people don't know. You can
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:28.280]  search for any area in settings rather than having to remember and click. I wonder if
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:31.640]  this, if that's the sort of thing, I wonder if that's something you can do in shortcuts.
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:35.640]  I just suddenly dawned on me. Like I bet. Have you been, have you been into the shortcuts
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:39.720]  thing? I definitely wanted to talk to you about. I'm there. Yeah. I got one more thing
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:43.560]  to say about cameras too, but I love the idea of shortcuts and I'm glad my friends are
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:49.400]  excited about it. It's, um, it's, it's a little cute. Uh, and there are some things
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:54.760]  that are very cool. Uh, I've seen people do, if you see most of the Matthew Castellini,
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:59.080]  you see people do the most amazing stuff with it and I go, that's cool. But like all mine
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:04.760]  are real like monkey stuff. Like show me this particular perspective in OmniFocus. Um, you
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:10.520]  know, real, real basic stuff that my, my, my short take on my short take on shortcuts
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:15.640]  is it's neat. I'm glad it exists. If anything, I think it will remind people what they could
[01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:19.320]  already be doing with Siri that they didn't know about. You can already do a ton of this
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:23.160]  stuff with Siri. You don't need to make a shortcut for a lot of this. I mean, here's
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:27.800]  how, let's put it this way. How many people know that if you use the app deliveries by
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:33.880]  June cloud, you can say, Hey dingus, open deliveries. I don't think now. I think people
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:39.640]  don't know that people who have a watch may remember that, but like really get good with
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:43.880]  that stuff before you worry about saying like, you know, you know, remember to flip, flip
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:49.400]  the dog at 7 25 PM if this condition is met. Like I'm glad people are going to realize
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:55.480]  because of that, but I'm very happy to use other people's for some stuff, but Oh, how
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:22:00.120]  do I say this? And so Siri gets so much better. It's, there's no point. I mean, there's so
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:05.400]  much, I still can't add a thing to OmniFocus from my watch. The home pod is just, it's
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:10.120]  sounds good, but like, I'm not going to invest a ton more in automation with my voice on
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:18.120]  this platform. When Alexa Alexa stop, when the Amazon dingus, when the Amazon echo system
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:22.520]  is so much more capable and getting better every Friday afternoon, I'm going to spend
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:27.720]  so much more time with that. Well, that's a separate discussion, but I will say the
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:30.120]  last thing about camera. Look, I see the last thing about camera. You go ahead and say what
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:33.560]  you're going to say. All I want to say about camera is like, wow, it's just so amazing
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:37.560]  to look at stuff we shot in 2007, 2008. My gosh, it's gotten better. But the thing I
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:41.560]  keep saying to my cohost on Dubai Friday, like we all bought the new phones. The thing
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:46.840]  I just keep saying, I keep sending them photos and marveling and saying they, I don't know
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:52.920]  what combination of the hardware, the lenses, the software. That's certainly a huge part
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:57.480]  of it's gotta be software, but this sounds so dumb, but you've really got to see it.
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:03.880]  You know, even in fairly weird conditions, it gets a shot you're going to love. And so
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:07.880]  with a camera on your phone and your kids doing something funny, you're going to be
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:12.360]  shocked how often it not only gets it, but it gets it real good. And you know what? It's
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:16.920]  not going to be the greatest photo ever taken that you're just grabbing your phone. You're
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:20.360]  hitting the button, do a long press and hit it. But you know what? Uh, my daughter had
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:24.520]  a six girl sleepover for her birthday and we went to the park to watch a cocoa. They're
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:29.400]  showing cocoa in the park and it was real foggy out. Typical like October night in San
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:34.280]  Francisco. And I got the coolest moody shots by sitting, mostly trying to be kind of still,
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:39.240]  but it got it, it got the shot, it got the HDR. You can see the pink of the jacket and
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:43.320]  the golden and the white and the, and, and there's still a little bit of frizz in the
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:47.560]  details on the leaves, but she can see it. And if you zoom in, yes, you're going to see
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:51.560]  there's some noise. What am I trying to say? They have nailed the camera in your pocket
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:56.680]  thing so hard and whatever trade-offs they made to like the world's greatest quality.
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:24:01.480]  If you meet these conditions, they have made the snapshot camera of my dreams. Yeah.
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:08.520]  I think that, I think that they feel that responsibility too, that they know that however
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:12.600]  much that, that there are professionals every second, every millisecond it takes for that
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:16.920]  thing to flip on, you're losing, you're losing memories, right? And they, they realize that
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:23.400]  most people there's quibbles that somebody who really, even at our level of being amateurs,
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:29.880]  that we can explain how the smart HDR can sometimes create unnatural looking results
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:35.320]  as much, you know, but that it's still, if you're shooting directly into the sun,
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:42.600]  if you're doing that, the unnaturalness of the results in with this smart HDR is still better
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:48.440]  than having it all blown out and having an unusual, unusable image, right? It's still doing
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:53.160]  the right thing. People who don't know to just keep the light behind you, keep the light behind
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:56.760]  you and you'll generally have better results. I feel so bad when you'd be walking around and
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:59.560]  somebody says, Oh, can you take a picture of us? I'm like, of course I'd love to take a picture of
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:04.360]  you. And I've instantly, even with my tiny bit of skills, I'm like, well, I'll tell you what,
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:08.360]  right now it looks like that light post is coming out of your head and be kind of nice.
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:13.320]  If the bridge was centered by your friends and I'm like art directing it because I know
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:17.400]  the shot they want me to take of them standing in front of the theater marquee with the sun
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:21.640]  pointing at the camera is going to make everybody look terrible. You're not going to have anything
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:25.720]  usable in that image. But friend of the show, Craig Hockenberry was telling a story a couple
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:28.760]  when this feature first came out. He's in, he lives out in California, Southern California.
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:33.560]  He's an avid swimmer and he swims. I think he swims almost either every day or almost every day
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:38.120]  in the ocean, in the ocean. And it's beautiful Southern California. So guess what? It's sunny
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:42.280]  every day. Yeah. It started as a conversation about the watch, but we were talking about the
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:46.280]  smart HDR and he just said that, you know, for years he would go swimming and either like,
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:50.840]  as he's going in the water or coming out, he'd see, you know, some family or some tourist,
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:55.640]  somebody's there at the beach shooting a picture right into the sun. And every single time he wants
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:26:00.760]  to, he, you know, and he's a very nice guy and he, you know, but you can't get it from his Twitter,
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:04.840]  but he's, he's, he's very calm. He's quiet and kind and he wants to help. But what are you going
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:10.840]  to do? You can't really, you know, you can't say, Hey, excuse me on the random six foot 10
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:17.000]  California swimmer. Yeah. A German on the beach is not going to accept that. May I suggest that
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.800]  you flip this image around and you stand over here and you stand over there. They're just going to
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:25.320]  think you're weird even though what he's telling you is you'd get a better image. So it will
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:29.160]  change the rest of your life as a photographer. Just learning that one dumb thing. Right. And
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:32.280]  you know, but now that the cameras work better that way, it's pretty amazing.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:38.040]  Yeah. Anyway, that was my thing. But anyway, it's the shortcuts thing. I Oh yeah. You know me,
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:43.400]  I'm an Apple script nerd and I've got the keyboard maestro and it's, it's big that that was sort of
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:48.520]  little fiddly things that I've done for myself over the years and, and carry around from machine
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:54.920]  to machine or big part of the whole reason that I feel, you know, my whole IO using an iPad feels
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:58.680]  like I'm typing with mittens, you know, a big part of that is that I've got all these little
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:04.680]  things on the Mac and I make a lot of stuff into services. Like, I mean, I feel like when you go
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:09.560]  to that website where you turn like a pro script or whatever into a service, like you're responsible
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:13.720]  for a lot of the serviceable things there. Can I tell you, here's a cool shortcut I made. So
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.880]  it, you know, I've got so many of those little services that do things with text
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.240]  that I, you, you, if you want them to have a keyboard shortcut, if you want to invoke
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:27.560]  them with a keyboard, it, you, you wind up, I mean, I know that this is a problem you've
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:32.600]  had Marlin is when you start assigning your own custom keyboard shortcuts to things,
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:36.760]  you eventually run into, you run out of keyboard shortcuts to use and,
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:41.400]  and you start risking a conflict with the built-in you're going to start using your
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:47.560]  pinky a lot more for your, for your Emacs, like chords. And when you use, when you use an app
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:54.440]  like BB edit or drafts, you know, uh, an app that is targeted toward enthusiasts, they have,
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:57.880]  guess what? They have a lot of built-in keyboard shortcuts already. But anyway,
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:02.520]  so this trick that I figured out for myself is, um, you know how, like when you're,
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:08.120]  when you open a menu, like on a Mac, so you open the file menu, you, if you start typing
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:13.000]  something like you open the file menu, if you type N it'll highlight the first item in the menu
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  that has starts with an N. So here in notes, you type, uh, and, and it highlights new note,
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.160]  and then you can select that with the return key. You can navigate the menu with the keyboard.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:27.480]  So what I did, I'm just like getting to the help menu, like command shift question mark. Well,
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:31.400]  or anything. So I've, that's another one, just commission of question mark and start typing.
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:35.320]  It'll find anything. Yes. In a menu. That's what you're typing. That is a fast. That's a cool.
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:42.360]  But what I did is I made a keyboard maestro shortcut that opens the services menu from
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:50.040]  any app. Ooh. And then with that services menu open, it just leaves it open. So it just opens
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:55.160]  the services menu. It just goes to, I think, I think the way the keyboard shortcut works
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:29:00.920]  is I forget how I made it. I could tell you, but how do you get the services from,
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:04.280]  from any app with one thing? I forget how I did it, but keyboard maestro has a way.
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:10.120]  But then once that menu is open, I can just type the name of any of my services and it'll start.
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:19.560]  So I have one, I have a script I wrote called tweet deets. I was cute, but all it is is it
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:26.840]  expects as input a, a, a URL pointing to a particular tweet. So it's a URL that's like
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:33.800]  twitter.com slash whatever the guy's name is slash here's the big long number of the tweet ID.
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:39.400]  That's the input. And then what the, what the service does is it turns it into like a little
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:45.240]  markdown link with their real name, with the brackets around their name, with the URL in
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:51.240]  the parentheses after the brackets and a colon. And then it quotes the whole tweet itself and
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:57.560]  puts it in a look, you know, with the block. I use this, I use this all the time, but I didn't
[01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:02.920]  want to sign a, you know, a custom shortcut. So all I do is I just have, what I made is shift
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:11.000]  command X and that opens the services menu for me from any app. It's X because X is the coolest
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:16.840]  letter of the alphabet and it's easily typed with one hand. And then I do that and I don't have to
[01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:20.600]  memorize all these different shortcuts anymore. I just know the script is called tweet deets. I
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:27.080]  type TW it's highlighted. I hit return and it runs. That's so great. I've got, I've got Chrome
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:31.320]  extensions that do stuff like that. I've got, there's several believe that I don't, I imagine
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:34.440]  you're not a Chrome user. There are several Chrome extensions that specialize in doing
[01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:38.680]  cool stuff with markdown, like what you just described with a, with a keyboard click. I've
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:46.200]  heard that. I'm not, I'm not, I am not Chrome. Chrome is so weird. There's so much stuff that
[01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:51.240]  I don't understand. Like Chrome, Chrome, Chrome, Chrome, like Chrome. Why don't you have standard
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:56.920]  UI elements where like I can see stuff like ups and downs. It's so weird. And why is it
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:31:01.560]  Chrome the only app where I hit option command H and it doesn't hide the other apps? Why is that?
[01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:05.800]  I don't know. Why is there so much that's weird in Chrome and what is happening? What is happening
[01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:13.160]  with these tabs now? Do you know that you can go back to the old UI? Well, Syracuse says they
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:17.800]  might've changed it permanently. I usually would go to flags, but have you seen this latest where
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:21.960]  they've got the X looks like, Syracuse and I were just talking about this on a soon to be released
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:27.800]  rectives, but like the X to close, it looks like something Jason Kotke designed as a mini font in
[01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:34.520]  2000 and then the thing next to it to launch a new tab looks like the cross of St. John like a flag
[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:39.000]  and it hasn't been fully knocked out. Like it doesn't, the transparency is so ugly. Send me
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:44.520]  a screenshot cause I've got my Chrome set running the old Chrome UI. And then if you're not in the
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:52.600]  app, right? If you're outside the app, but you can still see it. The tab that you were in is now red.
[01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:58.520]  Wait, what the hell is going on here? I'm trying to quit Chrome and it, and when I do command Q
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:03.400]  instead of quitting, it shows me a thing that says hold command Q to quit. Oh, are you sure
[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:07.480]  you want to quit? Are you really sure? Oh, you see, you have to press and hold command. See that,
[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:12.680]  that's, that should be illegal. Do you, that is not how a Macintosh program works. Yeah,
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:18.600]  that's cheating. Okay, so here you go. Have a look at this. That is what my three open tabs look like
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:26.440]  when I'm outside of, so I was like, wait, I see it. I see it. That's pretty pretty.
[01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:32.600]  You can almost tell it. There's tabs there. We're back to the CCC EEE problem. What the hell is
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:38.440]  this? It's garbage. When did they switch to this? You like that red tab? Isn't that pretty? Why is
[01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:42.120]  it red? You're like the cross of St. John right next to there in a completely different design
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:46.360]  language. And it's above the baseline. Like it's above. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But you can almost
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:51.960]  tell if you look real carefully, the feed Wrangler one, that's, that's, that's more of the EEE.
[01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:58.440]  And then DoorDash is more of the like, that's more FFF, I guess. But in this case, the tab that is
[01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:06.040]  nominally focal, if you were in the app is gray. It's really bizarre. Yeah. All right.
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:12.600]  Material. Is that what this is? Material? I guess so. I got to switch mine back. Anyway,
[01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:19.000]  here's where I wanted to go. The whole shortcut thing. I think, I think I have been old Manning,
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:24.840]  the shortcuts app in iOS 12, meaning it's, it seems a little bit fiddly to me. It seems a
[01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:30.040]  little ridiculous that you're doing quote unquote programming, but instead of just typing, if this,
[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:36.040]  then that you've got like these, you know, things you drag out and it's, you know, graphical instead
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:42.360]  of, you know, text and it, it therefore makes it a little bit harder to just copy and paste and
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:46.840]  share it with somebody else. You've got to share it. And I think I've been like, eh, kind of rolling
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:51.800]  my eyes at it. Uh, but now the more for you, good for you for catching that, the more that I'm
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:56.120]  talking to people about it though, I think I'm totally underselling it. And so, uh, after that
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:34:02.360]  event last week, uh, and, uh, uh, what I told you, I ran into Austin man, the photographer,
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:05.080]  and he was like, well, let's go get a cup of coffee. And I was like, yeah, that'd be great.
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:10.520]  So we went and got a cup of coffee. Um, we, I, you know what? It wasn't even coffee. It was beer.
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:16.680]  That's fine. I think about it, but it was, it was a cool place in Brooklyn that looked
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:21.080]  like a coffee shop, but they also sold draft beer. Uh, and he was showing me some of these
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:24.920]  shortcuts he's made. So he's, he said, I'm on airplanes a lot. He's, you know, cause not only
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:29.720]  does he fly frequently when he does fly, he's flying around the globe. And so there, he's got
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:36.840]  a lot of time where he doesn't have internet. Um, and he's really gotten into the shortcuts and
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:41.720]  he's built a bunch for himself and they do some really amazing things. So he can just say to his
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:46.760]  phone, Hey, dingus, uh, I forget what he calls it, but it's like, uh, put me into shooting mode.
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:51.320]  And then in other words, this is like he, he's going to use his phone camera to shoot
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:58.520]  and it does things like turns on, do not disturb, uh, sets his colors the way, you know,
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:03.240]  the brightness to where he wants it. But the thing is he does a similar thing like for nighttime
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:07.640]  shutdown. Yeah. I love that idea of like, yeah, that's a smart use. It's super smart and it's,
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:11.720]  it does more things than I thought would have been available through the shortcuts. And then he just
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:16.600]  has the habit now of every time he starts shooting to do that because like one of the weird things
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:23.560]  about the iPhone and I, I really, really hope that Apple makes this an option next year because I
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:28.280]  think it's overdue is I think they have to start treating, stop treating an incoming phone call as
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:34.760]  this magical, you need to stop everything you're doing. I totally agree. We're taking over your
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:43.880]  second. I mean, second only the, the only second for me there is like a video in an ad or on
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:48.440]  Twitter or something, hijacking your sound and losing your place in overcast. Oh yeah,
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:53.000]  that's right. But that's the, there is no event that destroys everything like a phone call. So
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.360]  you could be shooting something and you could, it could be, you know, you're getting this great
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:00.680]  video footage and all of a sudden a phone call comes in and it's, it's racked. Oh my God,
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:03.800]  I hadn't thought of that. So you put on, so what you want to do is you want to have,
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:09.320]  do not disturb turned on and you want to go into your settings app and change, do not disturb to,
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:17.800]  um, to always be on, even if you're using the phone, because by default, do not disturb,
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:24.360]  don't ring, don't do by default, do not disturb. Only doesn't disturb if the phone is locked and
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:29.080]  off and if you're unlocked and actually using it, it assumes, oh, well, you don't mind if you get
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:33.880]  notifications now because you're using the phone, even stuff like getting, getting messages, popups,
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:37.640]  like if I'm trying to watch TV, like sometimes I'll flip on the iPad and just walk around with
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:42.600]  headphones listening to MSNBC cause I'm broken inside and any kind of a pop up for like a,
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:49.160]  like a notification pauses Hulu. So I, so if you're saying anything that could kibosh my video,
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:55.400]  make that stop. Yeah. So he's, and he's also got one he made called, uh, uh, share my contact and
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:59.880]  it just, he just says to his phone, share my contact and then it pops open his contact card
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:05.320]  with airdrop and then anybody who's nearby. And I was like, wow, this is actually almost as easy
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:10.440]  to share contact information now as the Newton was back in 1994 at the bump.
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:16.680]  Do you remember that you could just point to Newton's at each other and they would,
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:20.520]  you could like exchange business cards. It was magic. It was amazing teacher that we still
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:26.520]  haven't replicated 25 years later. Big IR used to be. There's so much stuff you use IR for. Yeah,
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:30.760]  everything was there and it was pretty reliable. Anyway, we need to beam your contacts. Anyway,
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:35.800]  I got it. I'm, I'm, I'm committing myself now to becoming a bit more of a shortcut nerd. I think
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:40.840]  I've undersold it. I think, oh, I, I feel, I feel bad now that I might've done the same thing. I
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:45.240]  didn't mean, I just, it was more of a not for me right now thing, not least because I used to be
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:50.840]  Merlin man. And I, I could spend all fricking day with shortcuts trying to make a thing happen.
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:54.680]  And it's like, no, I've reached a point in life where like, I'm happy to let other people do that
[01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:59.560]  for me. I, there's a million things I want to remain curious about and a whole, whole bunch
[01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:03.720]  of stuff. I'm happy being in curious about learning how to do computer programming in a UI
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:09.640]  on my phone is something I'm okay to leave to the youngs. But I do agree with you. I do absolutely
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:14.360]  agree with you. I do still think it's a weird comma with that said, I just don't think it's
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:19.880]  kind of weird that you like watch the whole thing run. It feels gross. It feels, it feels,
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:25.240]  I don't know. It just feels like you're playing that board game mousetrap. Yeah. It feels like
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:30.680]  you're dropping the marble down and watch. It's like an okay. Go video. You're watching it. Yeah,
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:36.760]  but it's no, the presence of it is amazing. And I think the coupling it from the idea of using your
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:40.280]  voice. Cause right now, when we think of Siri, what does Siri mean? As we've said before,
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:44.520]  Siri means like at least three, four different things and getting to the point of this being
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:50.040]  a piece of automation, bespoke automation that you can invoke various ways that will, that will
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:53.720]  become very powerful. And like I say, people like that, Matthew fell out, he's doing some,
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:59.160]  he used to be at workflow, right? And he's on his own now. He's amazing. He does just his,
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:03.800]  you see his screens and screens and screens of these. I think he's got like 200 of them on his
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:07.720]  phone. It is magic. Yeah, but that's, see, that's a weird thing though. That's where you start,
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:10.920]  it starts getting weird cause you can't make like folders in that app. So if you have like
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:15.720]  200 shortcuts there, it's just like one list. Absolutely. Okay. Let's do this. You want to talk
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:19.480]  about this? You want to still talk about what we're using or you mostly just publicly putting
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:24.760]  a line in the sand. I'm just publicly putting a line in the sand. What do I use this for? Honestly,
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:29.320]  I added a bunch. It was so funny. It was like Patton Oswald's politically incorrect joke about
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:33.320]  TiVo back in the day where when you, when this first became available on the phone, it was like,
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:39.000]  you just typed, do you want soup for dinner to your wife? Do you want to do that again? It's
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.840]  like, no, no, Siri, I don't want to do that again. I did it that one time. I don't, I don't need to
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:46.440]  do that again. Like why you keep suggesting that I just type a thing. I just type. It's like when
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:51.240]  Amazon says, Hey, you know, you bought orange shoe trees. You want to buy more orange shoe
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:56.280]  trees? And you're like, no, nobody. I already got the thing I need. What have I got? I've got,
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:02.440]  Oh, I have started using eat 24 and no, I should correct myself. I have not tried this yet,
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:08.280]  but they've added shortcuts to eat 24 like grub hub. So you can like order your go-to meal with
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:16.200]  your voice. Now I got, um, I definitely got, um, looking at OmniFocus, um, perspectives. Some are
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:24.440]  real dumb. Find my AirPods. Very happy to have that, uh, play overcast, uh, kill the lights,
[01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:33.480]  um, find Ellie's phone. That's a good one. If you do real good. Right. If it's, you know,
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:36.680]  if it's something you do a lot now, so you're into it, you're using it. It's,
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:40.040]  Oh no, no, I've definitely done it. No. Here's what I haven't done. So what I've done is that
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:43.480]  I've, I've taken their serving suggestions and go, yeah, I could see that being useful.
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:46.600]  Like you go into overcast and he's got a whole codex in there of all the different things that
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:50.840]  you can do with that. I've got play do by Friday. I've got play accidental tech podcast. Um, I got
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:54.840]  all of those, but like the mainly, you know, sometimes I just feel like a dingling and go
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:41:00.520]  like, I forget. And I'm good at this, John. I'm good at this. Not like other people say,
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:05.080]  I'm good at this. And I know what I can do with Siri and I still don't always do it.
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:09.960]  So like main, like I say, mainly it's reminded me that I can say things like open deliveries or what
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:14.920]  time did the warriors play tonight or whatever. I can just do that stuff. And you know, hopefully
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:19.960]  Siri will continue to improve to, to where you aren't frustrated by what you just asked him
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:25.880]  before we move on. Uh, yeah. Uh, what do you think about this new keyboard cover for the iPad?
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:32.680]  Well, I spent a grand total of about one hour with it and it's fine for somebody. It's, it's,
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:37.080]  what did I say to you last night? Uh, it was like, it's like typing on a pizza box
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:43.880]  with children's candy for keys. Cause it's like smarties. Yeah. Smarties. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:47.880]  It says like you're typing on smarties on a pizza box. It's fine if you need it,
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:53.480]  but like there are way better solutions. Also when you fold it back, your hands are touching keys.
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:59.320]  Yeah. We're new design, right? So the new design, the old design had like a weird
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:04.200]  asymmetrical hump because there was a piece that folded over the keys, but that at least was there
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:09.240]  so that when you folded it just opened it like a book and you don't want to, you just want to use
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:14.440]  your iPad as an iPad while you folded the keyboard cover around to the back. And now instead of
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:21.960]  having the cover that the weird asymmetrical bump, now it's just exposed keys and that's kind of
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:28.120]  gross. It's weird. It shuts off the, my first concern was, Oh my God. So you mean it's making
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:31.160]  keys clicks? And it's like, no, no, no. They're smart about that. And this thing has like,
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:37.080]  I think it's about 750 magnets on it and a whole bunch of tungsten and it's, it's got so many
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:42.280]  fucking magnets, but it, uh, no, but when you flip it around, you are merely just holding a keyboard.
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:49.080]  It's not causing the keyboard to happen. Right. But there are so many, I don't know. I don't know.
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:52.840]  It's weird. Like, you know, our old friend Leslie Harpold used to say, I hate buying toys for my
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:56.920]  toys. You know, um, that that's, there is a concerning thing where you feel like you're
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:00.840]  getting a lot of stuff in order to get any value out of the thing that you have. I have no doubt
[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:04.440]  in my mind that that's going to work fine for somebody who travels a few times a month, take
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:09.080]  it on a plane. But you know, you're really, you're always not that far from being to the point where
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:13.880]  you're like, why don't you just bring your Mac book? Yeah. Oh, it's, and I just, and I can't get
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:19.240]  over the fact that when you put an iPad into laptop mode, it is so top heavy because you've
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:24.600]  got the whole computer and a glass touch screen sticking up and you've got like the super
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:31.240]  lightweight keyboard. Yeah. Which is really, I mean, it's, it's more so we'll get some kudos.
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:37.720]  The way that it magnetically with its 750 magnets magnetically snaps into one of the two grooves.
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:43.720]  I was slightly shocked last night when I went to fold it back up and I went, Hmm. And then I got
[01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:47.880]  this resistance. I was like, Oh you, you got this. You're not going to just slip out of there. Like
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:54.600]  you used to that, that, that was great. The experience of typing on this is garbage. It's $200.
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:59.480]  It has no media keys and it is not fun to type on. It feels like you're typing on the side of
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:05.160]  a tent. Like it's just, it doesn't feel good. It's well, I don't know. You tell me how much
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:10.920]  time have you spent with it? I'm guessing not a lot. I did. I did write the first half of my
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:16.040]  iPad review using it. And at one point it just got late in the night and I was like, to hell with
[01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:21.080]  this. I'm going to finish this on my, on this Mac share, which I was also trying to spend time with
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:26.040]  to write a review the next day. Oh no. Um, the call's coming from inside the review products.
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:31.080]  Yeah. But now I, I think it's better. I, you know, and I see that a lot of people like it,
[01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:36.360]  but it is $200 is a lot like a lot of money for what you're getting there when a lot of money.
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:41.480]  I like it. And I think that Apple did the right thing here by making the sort of keyboard piece,
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:46.760]  a, a solid non foldable thing, you know, that there are no more, you know, there's no more
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:51.720]  origami involved to getting it set up. You just sort of open it and it slots in just one of two
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:57.400]  positions and you're done. And it really is more, if it's the only case you ever use, let's be
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:45:01.880]  honest, like, so like me, I tend to like just the folio or, or no case at all when I'm just sitting
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:05.720]  around the house. If it's the only case you ever use, it probably won't bother you because you're
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:09.640]  used to the thickness, the weight, the keys, right? Like if you were through word, like most
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:13.880]  normal people spend $200 on something you intend to use for three years every day, I think you'll
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:18.360]  definitely get used to it. That's what you've decided to do. Yeah, totally. It's just hard for
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:23.080]  me to go back and forth between a Mac book and this because there's so many differences. And
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:28.280]  yes, you know, the truth is I prefer the Mac book for the, for that sort of, you know,
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:33.240]  we use the word laptop. I mean, and just literally describe the setup that I use,
[01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:38.200]  which will make everybody's eyes roll so hard into the, like, why don't you just use your
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:44.840]  perfectly serviceable 2015 Mac book pro territory? Well, what's your scenario? I'm sorry. I
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:48.600]  interrupted you. No, I, well, I'm just saying we use the word laptop to mean, you know,
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:52.840]  I try to use the word notebook computer rather than laptop. Oh, interesting. Cause laptop does
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:59.480]  imply an all in one, but yeah, but it is true. Well, and that you, I don't like the way that
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:04.760]  it literally implies a certain use case of having the computer on your lap, you know? So in general,
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:09.240]  I try to avoid it, but we do mental model. You get, you get stuck to some paradigmatic
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:13.960]  idea of where that came from in the same way you say iPhone. But the truth is we do sometimes use
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:18.600]  our notebooks on our laps. You know, like when I'm on an airplane, I don't, I prefer to have
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:24.120]  it on my lap than to have it on the tray. Mm hmm. Uh, you know, I felt that, you know,
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:29.720]  filthy that thing is, uh, the train, uh, when I take the train to New York, which I've done a lot
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:33.880]  recently because there's been a lot of Apple stuff in New York. Um, some of the seats on the train,
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:37.240]  you can get like a little table and that's nice. And then there's others where you're,
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:43.480]  it's more like a traditional, just a train seat. Uh, I put the, I put my computer on my lap and
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:48.760]  I'm actually using it as a quote laptop. And I think that this new iPad keyboard, the smart
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:54.200]  keyboard folio, it is definitely better for the literal use case of using it on your lap.
[01:46:54.200 --> 01:47:00.120]  I think it's great and that's great. Uh, but boy, it's, it, it is kind of weird.
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:06.360]  I stole this set up directly from Jason Snell and boy is it farcical, but for when I'm in the house
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:10.200]  and like there is a use case for me that is, I don't know, kind of weird, which is like,
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:14.360]  I like to stand, I don't have a standing desk. My current standing desk is using my daughter's,
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:18.840]  uh, disused Ikea play kitchen. I have an Ikea play kitchen. I stand out as the perfect size
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:23.400]  for a standing desk. Are you serious? I'm serious. My wife hates it. She hates it so much.
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:25.720]  She keeps saying, you think you'd like to get a real standing desk? And I'm like,
[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:32.920]  I kind of like the Ikea kitchen. It's it's real. It's but other times I do like to stand.
[01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:36.520]  I like to eat. There's, I'm not a big sitter. I can either stand or lay down. That's my,
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:39.960]  that's how I roll. If I'm standing in the kid, if I'm standing in the kitchen, listening to the NPR,
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:44.360]  making dinner, I need to lay down. I like to have my, I like to have my iPad and my keyboard
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:49.240]  at a level that is sensible to me. Uh, if you're ready for the privilege white guy hour,
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:53.640]  I have done this with two iPads and it is extremely powerful. Here's what I do. Um,
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:59.080]  mainly what I'm doing with one iPad set up, I have something, let me read you the SEO,
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:05.320]  uh, optimized a title for this on Amazon. Uh, via an iPad pro stand tablet stands,
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:11.560]  three 60 rota rotatable aluminum alloy desktop. It's, it's called VI OZ O N and it's a very
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:18.280]  pretty, uh, Apple ask looking stand. So just VI OZ O N iPad. Try that on Amazon or I could
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:24.600]  send you the link. Um, yeah, so, and so the, there has a, what do you call a clasp, an arm,
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:29.720]  it's got a spring loaded dingus that you open up to put your iPad in there. Any angle for
[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:35.240]  viewing that you want portrait landscape, full, full swivel, any way you want. And I pair that
[01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:41.320]  with the Modius laptop pro keyboard for Mac version five. I got the same one. That's the
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:46.360]  snow keyboard. It's the one that's snow keyboard now and forever. No. And it's not, it's not a
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:51.160]  DOS. It's not a full Modius, but like once you started using this thing around the house
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:55.480]  and you get those media keys, don't you think like the media keys, it sounds so dumb, but
[01:48:55.480 --> 01:49:01.400]  they really are great. And this is, this is my, if I need to type on the iPad as a device,
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:06.040]  this is an incredibly, there's a slight latency on the Bluetooth. The weirdest thing I get
[01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:10.120]  out of the latency on the Bluetooth is once you start using your iPad with a keyboard,
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:13.960]  let me tell you the world's greatest move is going to change your game command space
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:20.440]  bar. You now are about three clicks away from any app on your iPad provide using spotlight.
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:26.520]  It is ridiculously powerful. My biggest problem there is it will start the spotlight search.
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:30.040]  There's a slight latency where I missed the first or second letter that I've typed. Do you ever
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:34.520]  get that? I've never noticed that. Not too bad, but that's a, that's a hell of a setup.
[01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:39.880]  And I, that for me, that works. I, there's not a lot of times by the nature of the iPad,
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:44.760]  there's not a lot of times when I want to be typing on a keyboard while I'm sitting somewhere.
[01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:51.160]  But isn't that so part of the weird, the way that I struggled to talk about the iPad as a
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:56.280]  power user is the weird way that I, we just spent a huge segment of the show talking about how
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:03.000]  finicky it is to, you know, to do multitasking stuff on an iPad. But in another way,
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.760]  it really feels when you have a keyboard connected to it and it's set up, it really feels like you
[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:11.080]  can just fly around and that command space to do it. So you're not, you're not worried about
[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:15.320]  poking on the screen. You're not worried about which apps are in your doc or which, you know,
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:18.520]  Oh, I want to get to this app, but it's not even on the first home screen. I've got it.
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:23.400]  It's almost like introducing quicksilver to, to a device where suddenly your keyboard, just everything
[01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:27.560]  you, you, you, you switch your POV about how this thing works and it just flies.
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:32.600]  You mentioned the app deliveries a while ago, which is a fantastic little app. It's,
[01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:36.840]  it's a, I don't know what it costs. It's a couple of bucks, but, and it's been around since it
[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:42.920]  started life as a dashboard widget. Remember that sure did. And now it's a real app for iOS and for
[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:48.520]  Mac and you just, no matter who's shipping you something, whether it's like a FedEx or UPS or
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:52.520]  the postal service, if you've got a tracking number, you copy it on for that matter. You,
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:56.440]  if you type in your Amazon and you're logged in with your email, you get the full details,
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:51:00.760]  or you can even just type in a link to it and it'll know, right? So you copied the tracking
[01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:04.760]  number. You go to deliveries, deliveries will be like, Hey, your clipboard looks like a UPS
[01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:09.320]  tracking number. Would you like to add an item? And it couldn't make it more, you know, easier,
[01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:13.560]  but it's sinks and it sinks across everything. Yeah. That's the thing is it uses iCloud for
[01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:18.760]  sinking and it's all rock solid and whatever you've entered on one machine shows up elsewhere.
[01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:24.520]  And I've got the second you updated on your Mac, your watch will ding and you can use the today
[01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:29.320]  widget on your phone. So you just flip over to the side and if there's anything coming, it'll,
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:33.160]  it'll say, you know, here's your things that are coming. It's two days away. It's one day away.
[01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:37.400]  And if there's nothing, then there's nothing. It's great. Anyway. But that to me is a perfect
[01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:42.360]  type of app where like, when you want to get to deliveries, you want to get to it right now and
[01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:46.440]  just paste this thing in, but you probably not going to put it in your doc is like one of your
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:54.520]  most frequently used apps. So like the, the, uh, the, the command space for spotlight D E L
[01:51:54.520 --> 01:52:00.360]  return is it it's phenomenal, but it really makes it, uh, in some weird ways, even though you think
[01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:05.320]  like the iPad is the one that's a weird computer with a keyboard, it's sort of meant to be used
[01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:10.680]  just as a touch screen. It is kind of awesome with a keyboard, right? Oh, it's absolutely,
[01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:15.400]  it's absolutely. And you'll never see one of the most interesting parts of this. You'll never see
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:20.440]  until you put a keyboard on there, which is the little tab switcher. So like you're no longer,
[01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:26.200]  so you don't have to do three swipes, bottom swipes to say, you don't have to go three bottom
[01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:30.920]  swipes. He goes tab, you do command tab, tick, tick, tick, and it takes you right there. It's,
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:35.800]  it's pretty wild if you've never used it. Yeah. Anyway, that's my take on the iPad.
[01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:42.520]  It is a very complicated, very complicated, pretty wild though. I mean, boy, just maybe
[01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:48.600]  a subtle change, but pretty wild is if I flip on the right Bluetooth thing so that I'm now
[01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:54.360]  the keyboard is now hooked up to the iPad. I hit space. I get my face a tiny bit closer
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:58.440]  and it logs me straight in without touching the screen. Oh, isn't that insane? Yeah. With
[01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:03.480]  the camera on the side. Yeah. I did not explain that well to people. You, uh, if you're using
[01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:06.760]  a keyboard, you don't have to, you don't have to, uh, touch anything except the keyboard.
[01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:10.600]  Just as it sees your face and knows who you are, you can just like double tap the space bar
[01:53:10.600 --> 01:53:15.880]  and yeah, and it's, it's exactly, it's, it, it just like on the phone. I mean, I, I don't
[01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:20.680]  understand the people who, who are ambivalent about face. It's got, I want to stipulate
[01:53:20.680 --> 01:53:25.560]  it has gotten way better. I do not. I disagree wildly with you, you fans who said that you
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:30.040]  stopped noticing it after a day. I never stopped noticing it, but then I think it was a software
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:34.040]  update. It wasn't the tennis. It was, I think it was a software update. It has gotten way
[01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:39.880]  better and it's crazy fast on the iPad. Yeah, it's, I honestly don't, I really don't notice
[01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:42.920]  it hardly at all on the iPad. If it's in the right position, it really feels like you don't
[01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:47.320]  have a passcode on your device. It just feels like it's always ready to go double tap the
[01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:52.040]  space bar. And I'm convinced Apple hasn't mentioned this, but I, a couple of the reviews
[01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:55.640]  that I've read, I didn't mention it in mind, but a couple of the reviews have read and
[01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:59.960]  they all say the same thing that I think it works at a greater viewing angle than the
[01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:03.480]  phone because it's like, you don't even have to be square in front of the iPad. You can
[01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:08.200]  be off to the side a little bit and it still works. I've been using this part time for
[01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:13.000]  16 hours. So I definitely feel like I can say this at this point, I have a microphone
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:16.760]  in front of my face right now. And if I move just the tiniest bit, it has no problem seeing
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:21.240]  me. I agree that that was my beef, John. It wasn't just, it wasn't the time it took once
[01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:26.680]  it recognized you to unlock it. It was the time it took to recognize you. Yeah. And that,
[01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:30.920]  I got a lot of false, like, Oh, you got, no, I need you to hold it here. It's almost like
[01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:35.240]  you've got those index lenses where I can see good far away here, but I got to look
[01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:39.880]  down and hold it in exactly the right spot here to read. That's how I felt. And I do
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:45.720]  agree with you. I isn't, that would be a strange thing not to announce. Oh, they don't want
[01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:48.680]  the, I, they don't want the iPhone to look bad. Right. I think that might be it. I think
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:53.240]  it's, they don't want to say it has a better viewing angle. I will say based on my extensive
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:58.360]  use over something like 16 hours so far, it has, it has definitely, uh, it's much more,
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:05.800]  it's much faster. You know that, you know that $1,500 phone we're selling, you know,
[01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:11.160]  this is better than that. I don't think they want to, I don't, you know, I wonder if that
[01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:17.560]  came out of something they learned or caused to happen out of the need to change the way
[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:21.480]  it detects a different, how am I putting this? Terrible. I don't know. If you want your iPhone
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:24.320]  to detect your face, you have to hold it a certain way at a certain angle. It can't be
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:29.400]  upside down. It can't be sideways. Whereas the iPad just gets where your face is. Do
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:32.400]  you think it's something? I don't know. I don't know what the, I don't know what the
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:36.740]  explanation is. You know those jackals. Ask them. Yeah, I'll ask. All right. Let me take
[01:55:36.740 --> 01:55:39.760]  another break here and thank our third sponsor. Oh God. How long are you going to do this
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:45.920]  thing? Uh, I don't know. Uh, it's our friends at Jamf. J A M F it's brought to you Jamf.
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:48.880]  Now that's their, their product that they want me to tell you about. It makes it easy
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:54.780]  to set up, manage and protect your apple devices. It's it management for your apple devices
[01:55:54.780 --> 01:56:00.820]  for non professional it people. It's great, great interface that a normal person can use.
[01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:06.560]  So if you're part of a team or a small business and you've got company devices from apple
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:09.920]  Mac books and you've got phones, you've given your staff, you've got some new iPads maybe
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:15.200]  coming in and you want to track these things in a professional way. You sign up for Jamf
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:21.320]  and it's great. It is so easy to keep track of your, um, these devices for your company.
[01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:24.840]  So like if you're an individual and like we were saying like earlier in the show, like
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:28.760]  if you've got a Mac and an iPad and a phone and they're yours, it's easy to track all
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:32.440]  three things. But once you're running like a small company, even with like five, six
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:36.920]  people and you've got, you know, now you're like 15 devices and stuff like that. Like,
[01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:41.000]  and somebody has to be in charge of this stuff. Jamf is where you want to go. Jamf now is
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:46.040]  what you want to use as a business grows and you, your inventory grows. It makes it so
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:52.000]  much harder if you're not managing these some way to track all these devices. And it's especially
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:56.360]  true if some of your employees are remote and that's obviously more, you know, that's
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:57:00.320]  the modern way to work. I mean, how many small businesses that start these days have everybody
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:05.440]  working in a room together. It just isn't the modern way of setting up a business. So
[01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:10.980]  with Jamf now you can check your digital inventory, distribute wifi and email settings. So all
[01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:15.620]  this sort of stuff that you can configure, deploy apps. So if you've got like custom
[01:57:15.620 --> 01:57:21.200]  in-house apps, you can just zip them around to everybody's phone or everybody's iPod.
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:27.360]  And it's perfect for company data and you can even lock a room, wipe a device as needed.
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:31.480]  So somebody on your sales staff says, Oh my God, I lost my iPad. I left it. I think I
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:36.840]  left it in a golf cart, left it in a golf cart. Exactly. Boom. You're used Jamf. Now
[01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:42.440]  you can wipe it. It's safe. You can say that's fine. Uh, no it experience needed. I cannot
[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:47.960]  emphasize this enough. This is a super great interface so that you get all of these really
[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:52.620]  professional it features without being an it expert. It's all self-explanatory with
[01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:58.640]  a great interface and they have a great deal for you. You can, uh, you get your first three
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:02.640]  devices for free and that's forever. So up to three devices, you just, you sign up for
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:06.240]  Jamf and you don't ever have to send them any money and they'll just let you manage
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:12.480]  these three devices forever. But it'll teach, it'll show you what it's like. Then, uh, you
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:17.000]  can add more for just two bucks a month per device. That's it. All you pay is two bucks
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:21.040]  a month per device that you add more than three. That's it. That's, that's the whole
[01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:26.760]  thing. What a great deal. Uh, keeps the price low and it's super manageable. So where do
[01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:36.320]  you go to find out more jamf.com j a m f.com slash the talk show. That's jamf.com slash
[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:41.240]  the talk show and you go to that special URL and they will, uh, they'll know you came from
[01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:48.000]  here. My thanks to Jamf. Great company. Big, big supporters of the show. Good job. Uh,
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:53.560]  so two hours in, we haven't talked about this election two years ago. I don't think it has
[01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:58.960]  to be too surpassingly long. Uh, because I don't have, I don't have that that much to
[01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:03.080]  say, but I think it's worth the, I think it's worth revisiting over the, over the years
[01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:08.280]  you and I have done a few things that, that have achieved evergreen status, right? Like
[01:59:08.280 --> 01:59:11.480]  now we've got two things, two things we've ever done that anybody cares about. Yeah.
[01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:15.200]  We talked about blogs right around the time people stopped making blogs. Right. And we
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:19.120]  talked about the 2016 election when it was too late to do anything about it. So you're
[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:23.440]  welcome everybody. An awful lot. Just remember to like and subscribe. An awful lot of people
[01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:30.520]  who took the, the 2016 election as hard as we did, uh, really appreciated our show talking
[01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:35.400]  about it. Uh, it seemingly has stood up there from people and you, I've seen you, you know,
[01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:38.080]  people tweet at us or something. People like, you know, I listened to it when it was new
[01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:43.160]  and it really helped. And I, you know, from, you know, middle of this is July, 2018 they're
[01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:46.480]  like, you know, I'd listen to it again just to see. And it was like, you know what, it
[01:59:46.480 --> 01:59:50.660]  really stands up. You guys did a great thing. I'm going to listen to this episode, you know,
[01:59:50.660 --> 01:59:54.600]  every couple months forever. And it's like, that's pretty impressive. That, that feels
[01:59:54.600 --> 02:00:01.280]  good. Yeah. And we, so we tried to talk about a polarizing election in a non-polarizing
[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:09.960]  way. At first, at first you're not going to catch everybody. And you know, it's a lot
[02:00:09.960 --> 02:00:13.920]  that's happened in the last two years. There's a lot that's as always with this, there's
[02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:16.680]  a lot that's going to be okay. John, you think we're going to be all right. There's a lot
[02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:22.800]  that's happened in the last two days. I would like to please issue a correction and an apology.
[02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:27.200]  We're not going to be fine. What the fuck was I talking about? That was the, I was whistling.
[02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:31.080]  You were, you had had a holiday party. I was very nervous and I was whistling past the
[02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:35.100]  graveyard and I said something really, really stupid in the interest of comforting myself
[02:00:35.100 --> 02:00:38.680]  and our listeners, which as I said, I think we're going to be fine. I don't think we're
[02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:45.280]  fine. I don't think we've been fine. I don't think we're going to be fine. And you know,
[02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:48.260]  at that point I had lived with the election about as long as I've lived with this new
[02:00:48.260 --> 02:00:55.200]  iPad pro, but we sure as shit aren't going to be fine. No, it's just, it's not fine.
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:01:00.440]  You update you an issue. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. You know, a lot of people aren't
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:05.360]  going to be fine. I think it's worth acknowledging it wasn't fine. It's not going to be fine.
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:13.520]  I don't know if we'll ever be fine again. There. One of the things is that I get confused
[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:18.120]  over. I want to simplify it. I want to simplify my view of politics. I want to stop obsessing.
[02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:24.600]  You know, I want to spend more time on, you know, talking about new iPads and less time
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:28.920]  thinking about the destruction of the planet. And I think, well, what's really important?
[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:33.400]  Which one is important? And I think like, well, you know, and this is partly why I was
[02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:38.000]  having a holiday party two years ago is I, I, I couldn't narrow, I'd think to myself,
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.960]  you know what, the worst part about this is going to be the climate change because climate
[02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:46.680]  change is, you know, we got to fix this or, or it'll get already behind the count on that.
[02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:50.000]  We need every day to get this fixed. Even then we need it. And there's all sorts of
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.480]  other stuff, you know, like they, they put some numb nuts on the Supreme court. Well,
[02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:58.120]  guess what? Even the, you know, 40 years from now there's nobody on the court who's still
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:01.400]  going to be on the court. You know, that, that will, you know, even if it takes a long
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:06.880]  time for the Supreme court to be flushed, you know, history has a long time. Whereas
[02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:12.200]  the climate thing I get, I get worked up about because if we don't, if we're already behind
[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:16.080]  and if we don't fix this, it, it, it isn't going to be fixable, right? It's, you know,
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:20.200]  Miami is going to be under six feet of water and you know that you can't just, you know,
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:26.320]  a couple of buckets, it's not going to fix it. But then, then I convinced myself that
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:35.800]  no, no, even as bad as that is, it's the normalizing racism is, is the bigger problem. And you
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:41.240]  know, just sort of emboldening people. We, you know, I, I'm not surprised that there's
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:47.760]  an awful lot of white nationalist racist jerks in America. He never, he never takes any of
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:53.880]  the opportunities that he has to be empathetic to anybody except himself and other people
[02:02:53.880 --> 02:02:59.680]  in power. But even today, even today, the day of those shootings, the shootings in California,
[02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:05.120]  he only ever finds all he can find in himself is the, the, he, he has such a hard on for
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:10.600]  men in uniform and he's always, so he's always so into these, the troops and the first responders,
[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:13.400]  nothing against them. Thanks. Thank you for your service. But you know what? Could you
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:16.600]  have a little empathy for the people who were just out having a drink that night? Do you
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:20.960]  have to, do you have to have such a bukkake party for the one cop that, you know, how
[02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:24.320]  about everybody else? How about all of the other people that every other president has
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:30.160]  ever found the ability talking about normalizing? He is normalizing an utter lack of empathy
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:36.360]  as something that is not only okay but is desirable and makes you seem tough. You're
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:39.360]  seeing it emulated in the other candidates. I'm not even seeing that's anywhere near the
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:44.920]  biggest problem, but the way that he has normalized that kind of self absorption and utter lack
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:49.100]  of empathy for anybody but the people that could serve him. That's going to be with us
[02:03:49.100 --> 02:03:52.400]  for a long time too because now that's the only way to fight it is to be the same way.
[02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:59.120]  It's where of a generation where we, you know, I think you and I, I think we maybe even talked
[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:03.440]  about it two years ago is I remember being a kid in the seventies, you know, a little
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:09.280]  kid, five, six, whatever. And the fact that I had like a openly racist, great uncle, like
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:13.520]  a guy who you would say like, Hey, are you racist? And he would just say, Oh yeah, yeah,
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:18.040]  I don't like black people. You know, and it was just, it was just that that was a thing
[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:23.360]  of people of a certain generation and I, and I kind of caught the tail end of it, of being
[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:27.280]  able to have like a great uncle who was just nobody, nobody saying anything about it. Nobody,
[02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:31.520]  nobody even rolling their eyes and going, Oh, Oh, Phil. Like, no, it was just, that's
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:35.800]  what was it like in Christmas story when he says his father, you know, painted with obscenities
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:42.820]  the way other people would, you know, that my family painted with racism. It was just,
[02:04:42.820 --> 02:04:47.320]  that's how they were, you know, and one of the normal, totally normal. Yeah. And I remember
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:52.400]  that and then I just, you know, I took it for granted, uh, you know, and I'm obviously
[02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:58.320]  approaching the whole thing from a position of tremendous, uh, privilege in terms of being
[02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:06.240]  a healthy white man, uh, you know, heterosexual, you know, anything you can check off as not
[02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:13.480]  really being susceptible to, uh, bigotry. I've got it really. Uh, you know, and I, I,
[02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:20.560]  I, I, you know, I, I'm trying to, I try to appreciate it as much as I can. Um, I do feel
[02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:25.240]  like the other, another one is the just, I talked about, I can't get over this, keep
[02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:29.480]  talking about like it's, it's the fight for your life on stuff like climate change, which
[02:05:29.480 --> 02:05:33.920]  nobody seems to care about. But then the other fight is like you look at Georgia, look what
[02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:41.960]  happened in Georgia where like this incredibly competent woman candidate, community organizer,
[02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:46.040]  incredibly qualified for her job. She never had a chance and it's not because she's not
[02:05:46.040 --> 02:05:49.480]  qualified. She never had a chance because the president was saying untrue things about
[02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:54.880]  her even as her opponent was the secretary of state who changed the voting laws while
[02:05:54.880 --> 02:06:00.520]  he was in an election and that kind of thing. And you get the gerrymandering, you get the
[02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:05.680]  crazy ass map in the Senate right now. You get all of these things that are so weighted
[02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:09.520]  toward the most corrupt people staying in power. And again, maybe that's not climate
[02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:13.400]  change. Maybe it's not uncle Phil's racism, but that is going to, we're going to be, can
[02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:17.360]  you even imagine how long it would take to get back to anything like normal? How are
[02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:21.560]  we going to work together with the other parties even when we're in power when we have to say,
[02:06:21.560 --> 02:06:25.200]  look guys, you have to admit you kind of screwed the pooch on a lot of this and the low election
[02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:26.200]  stuff.
[02:06:26.200 --> 02:06:30.960]  I just can't, I really, in the last two years I knew it was going to be bad and that was
[02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:34.960]  hence the holiday party, but I couldn't get my hand, I couldn't come to grips with how
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:40.100]  bad it was going to be. It's just, I just knew it was bad and it's like, I don't know,
[02:06:40.100 --> 02:06:43.220]  like you're on the Titanic and you realize the ship is going down and you realize that
[02:06:43.220 --> 02:06:46.040]  if you're lucky, you get in the water, you know, you're not going down with the ship
[02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:49.820]  and it's like, you think it's going to be cold. Oh boy. Is it cold? Yeah. You don't
[02:06:49.820 --> 02:06:54.420]  know until you're actually in the water, how cold. And I really feel like one of the things
[02:06:54.420 --> 02:06:58.760]  that I look at two years later and look at what this guy is saying and how he went into
[02:06:58.760 --> 02:07:03.600]  this election and the way he, he's just turned everything up. I mean, you thought it was
[02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:08.200]  bad two years ago when he ran for president. Thank God for his lack of competence and focus
[02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:11.160]  and you were really so much worse. There really was part of me that thought, well, he's got
[02:07:11.160 --> 02:07:15.340]  to tone it down once he's in office and instead it's, he's turned it up like with this, this
[02:07:15.340 --> 02:07:20.520]  ridiculous stuff about the caravan, the caravan, the caravan, and she hasn't mentioned so much
[02:07:20.520 --> 02:07:25.480]  since the, and the ad that the crazy ad that he made that all these networks were like,
[02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:29.800]  we can't run this. This is overly openly racist. But the thing I'm trying to get to is this
[02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:36.100]  point of, of me and me, maybe you, uh, and I think that there's an awful lot of people
[02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:42.100]  who are not straight white, 40 something year old men who are like, uh, no, it's always
[02:07:42.100 --> 02:07:49.560]  been there. But the way that we as a society spent 40 years sort of pushing openly racist
[02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:53.680]  views out of the mainstream, that there's all what, you know, there's conservatives,
[02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:57.580]  there were liberals, but even on the, you know, nobody was allowed to be openly racist.
[02:07:57.580 --> 02:08:02.080]  That was completely agreed. Like you, if you're an open racist, you can't, you can't work
[02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:08.300]  here. You can't be on TV. You, you don't get to have an op ed column. You know, David Duke
[02:08:08.300 --> 02:08:12.580]  doesn't get to have an op ed column in a respectable newspaper, right? You automatically
[02:08:12.580 --> 02:08:17.100]  quiet like we've got to a place where you are more or less if there's always casual
[02:08:17.100 --> 02:08:21.700]  racism, but if you were, you kind of qualified yourself as a fringe character who was not
[02:08:21.700 --> 02:08:27.080]  to be taken seriously at that point. Open racism was just, uh, I, I, what I took for
[02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:33.960]  granted how, how much work that was as a society and how incremental it had to be. And it's
[02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:40.620]  one of those things like the, the, the dam has been smashed and it's not, it's not like,
[02:08:40.620 --> 02:08:45.120]  Oh, we're going to win. If we win an election two years from now, then we can just go back
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:50.980]  to the way it was like you don't, it, you know what I mean? Like it, it D it's the way
[02:08:50.980 --> 02:08:56.060]  that destruction can be instantaneous and construction takes a long time. It takes a
[02:08:56.060 --> 02:09:01.500]  very, it took a very long time to build the world trade center and it took, you know,
[02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:07.260]  15 minutes to, to bring it down. You know, I mean, it's something as simple as it to,
[02:09:07.260 --> 02:09:11.380]  it takes a, you know, six months or a year to build a house and like one afternoon of
[02:09:11.380 --> 02:09:15.340]  leaving the bathwater running. It's not, it's not difficult to screw up something pretty
[02:09:15.340 --> 02:09:20.620]  good by just being an idiot for a fairly short period of time. So being a willful, being
[02:09:20.620 --> 02:09:24.780]  a willful, it'd be a willful, like terrible person. But like I say, thank God for his
[02:09:24.780 --> 02:09:29.340]  lack of focus and competence. Can you imagine if it was, if, if you had somebody with surrounded
[02:09:29.340 --> 02:09:33.020]  by the competent people that George W. Bush had, he, all he could do was kill 500,000
[02:09:33.020 --> 02:09:37.540]  people. Can you imagine what Trump could do if he knew what he was doing? It's even imagine
[02:09:37.540 --> 02:09:41.640]  it's really something and you know, and I know it's, it's, it wasn't watching nine hours
[02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:46.900]  of TV a day. It's a trope at this point to say, boy, we didn't know what we had with
[02:09:46.900 --> 02:09:51.740]  George W. Bush, you know, and as much as I disliked him politically and as much as I
[02:09:51.740 --> 02:09:57.740]  thought he was a bit of a doofus and as much as I thought that and I can't wait to watch
[02:09:57.740 --> 02:10:03.100]  that new movie about Jamie vice vice. Oh, cannot wait for that. I didn't even recognize
[02:10:03.100 --> 02:10:10.340]  Christian Bale. No way. Totally lost as into that Dick Cheney voice, the makeup. Oh, I
[02:10:10.340 --> 02:10:15.220]  can't wait. But you know, it seemed pretty obvious from the outside, just as a consumer
[02:10:15.220 --> 02:10:19.460]  of the New York Times and you know, watch a little, you know, stay up to date on the
[02:10:19.460 --> 02:10:25.040]  news. It seemed pretty obvious that Dick Cheney was running things, right? Oh, right, right.
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:29.080]  But they were competent. You know, they, they, they, they were wrong about things, but they
[02:10:29.080 --> 02:10:33.660]  did these things in a competent way. It is, it is very different today. So anyway, that
[02:10:33.660 --> 02:10:40.880]  brings us to the election of this week and midterms. And I got to tell you, I was invested
[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:45.840]  deeply in this because I really do feel and I honest to God, I think the country is still
[02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:49.700]  in serious, serious trouble. I think we're on shaky ground. And I think the only chance
[02:10:49.700 --> 02:10:55.400]  we had is, is for the Democrats to have taken the house. I really, really feel that if the
[02:10:55.400 --> 02:11:02.580]  Republicans had kept both houses of Congress for the next two years, that we definitely
[02:11:02.580 --> 02:11:07.000]  it's, it's funny because like we're so behind in the count on so many things. And the one
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:12.540]  thing that felt clear was, listen, having a blue wave, whatever the fuck that means.
[02:11:12.540 --> 02:11:18.060]  I'm sorry, I'm cursing on your show, whatever it means to have a wave. We well, who knows
[02:11:18.060 --> 02:11:23.340]  what that means. But what we do know is even if we don't get all the things that we want,
[02:11:23.340 --> 02:11:29.500]  what we do know is that if we don't see some improvement in this, especially in this one
[02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:34.020]  area, which is we really need to get the house for a very, there are things that only the
[02:11:34.020 --> 02:11:38.420]  house can do. We hope we get the Senate too. But what we, what we know for sure is if there's
[02:11:38.420 --> 02:11:42.940]  a washout or a systematic total miscalculation in the polls and it turns out we're going
[02:11:42.940 --> 02:11:48.900]  to get our clock cleaned even worse than 2016. What we did know is like, no matter how long
[02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:52.940]  it's going to take to rebuild all this water damage, what we do know is if we miss it on
[02:11:52.940 --> 02:11:58.060]  this one, we are well and truly screwed. And pretty much to a certainty, we can say this
[02:11:58.060 --> 02:12:02.100]  is what the country is now. Yeah. And the house, of course, all the voting irregularities,
[02:12:02.100 --> 02:12:05.540]  but we don't have time to get into that. But still, but if you, but if that had gone as
[02:12:05.540 --> 02:12:10.740]  badly as 2016 went, you know, and all our, all our old drinking buddy Nate Silver still
[02:12:10.740 --> 02:12:14.980]  said the same thing, you know, do you want to get on a plane that has a 15% chance of
[02:12:14.980 --> 02:12:19.140]  crashing? No, that's what I, that's how it works. That's how percentages work. That's
[02:12:19.140 --> 02:12:26.660]  why it's a percentage. But what we knew was if this goes wrong now, it's actually officially
[02:12:26.660 --> 02:12:30.060]  really, really bad. There's no, there's no bull work against what these folks are going
[02:12:30.060 --> 02:12:34.620]  to be able to do. So I, you know, it was the election was Tuesday, Tuesday morning was
[02:12:34.620 --> 02:12:39.780]  the, the embargo date for the Mac book air reviews. So I, I, uh, you know, had that and
[02:12:39.780 --> 02:12:44.000]  then I, you know, spent the day sort of reading other people's reviews. Mac mini reviews dropped
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:49.260]  at the same time. And so I, you know, we went and we voted, uh, you know, and, but then
[02:12:49.260 --> 02:12:55.140]  I kind of stayed off political news all day. I had, I had plenty of, you know, Mac mini
[02:12:55.140 --> 02:13:00.580]  and Mac book air stuff to read and review to focus my mind. And I kept telling myself,
[02:13:00.580 --> 02:13:04.180]  I'm not going to put MSNBC on until eight o'clock, eight o'clock Eastern. That's what
[02:13:04.180 --> 02:13:08.120]  Madeline did. Madeline did that. I am not so good. I am not doing it till eight. I'm
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:13.860]  not doing it till Amy broke and she put it on around seven. Uh, and I was in the kitchen
[02:13:13.860 --> 02:13:19.140]  so I could hear it and I'd hear seven. So that's for my time. That's right around when
[02:13:19.140 --> 02:13:25.540]  the big first big closing, the first big closings. And then they had footage of, uh, I think
[02:13:25.540 --> 02:13:30.140]  it was in Georgia. There was lines, there was, well, there was a polling place where
[02:13:30.140 --> 02:13:33.660]  the machine, the machine, they had three, they had three, they have three machines in
[02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:39.100]  the whole place and they needed a specific proprietary power cord for them. And nobody,
[02:13:39.100 --> 02:13:44.760]  nobody had the power cord like dongle town. It's going to be all right. And it's like,
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:49.220]  how can this happen? How can it be, you know, how can it be election day and you don't have
[02:13:49.220 --> 02:13:53.380]  the right power cord for the voting machines and we could open up the whole can of worms
[02:13:53.380 --> 02:13:57.500]  of, we shouldn't really need a power cord for these things. We should, we really should
[02:13:57.500 --> 02:14:01.620]  for election security be doing a lot of this stuff on paper so that there's a paper show.
[02:14:01.620 --> 02:14:04.660]  You'd fire the entire crew. If your first night on Broadway couldn't happen because
[02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:08.380]  somebody forgot a cord and they'll go home. Well, this is different. It's only the future
[02:14:08.380 --> 02:14:14.820]  of our democracy. I don't know. It just seemed like from the first few hours of news were
[02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:22.780]  all seemed bad and I looked at it put me in a mood. You know what? It really, I was inconsolable
[02:14:22.780 --> 02:14:27.620]  fairly early cause I went right back into that old feeling of that old pattern. I didn't
[02:14:27.620 --> 02:14:30.660]  already start to feel like we're not going to win everything. Well, you let you always
[02:14:30.660 --> 02:14:35.700]  like these sports teams that always win. So like if you're, you know, even if you could
[02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:38.980]  win, you're already kind of down a little bit. Like we're not going to have the blue
[02:14:38.980 --> 02:14:44.460]  wave, are we? It's not going to happen. Steve Kornacki is the, the nerd on msnbc. He's the
[02:14:44.460 --> 02:14:51.740]  guy who sort of, uh, we can talk about, I don't watch msnbc on a daily basis. Every
[02:14:51.740 --> 02:14:55.660]  once in a while I do. I like, I like Rachel Maddow. I think she does a good job in a,
[02:14:55.660 --> 02:14:59.300]  and if I'm flipping around, I might, might watch her. I, you know, I watch here and there.
[02:14:59.300 --> 02:15:05.500]  I like their shows. Uh, but I tend to read my political stuff. Uh, you know, big, uh,
[02:15:05.500 --> 02:15:10.140]  TPM fan here. I linked to it all the time, but uh, talking points memo is a great site.
[02:15:10.140 --> 02:15:14.860]  I keep up today. I read most of my political stuff. I find I don't want to, I don't have
[02:15:14.860 --> 02:15:20.340]  that many hours a day to watch TV. I don't want to spend it. I know Steve Kornacki. I
[02:15:20.340 --> 02:15:25.820]  know Steve Kornacki works at MBC news full time and I know he's a political guy and a
[02:15:25.820 --> 02:15:29.420]  writer like just for, he has a new book out that's supposed to be just terrific, but he's
[02:15:29.420 --> 02:15:33.820]  a writer. He's a correspondent like and a writer. So, but I don't see, I don't think
[02:15:33.820 --> 02:15:39.180]  I've seen him since two years ago on election night and I will say, I have to say like seeing
[02:15:39.180 --> 02:15:44.700]  him like the way guy Lombardo used to be for New Year's Eve. Like I don't know. I'm sure
[02:15:44.700 --> 02:15:49.580]  you do other things the other, you know, the last 700 and some days, but I haven't. He's
[02:15:49.580 --> 02:15:53.020]  the guy who makes me nervous with the map, right? You're the guy who makes me nervous
[02:15:53.020 --> 02:15:59.220]  with the map and tells me bad news. Yeah. Right. It could still be 40 votes in a box
[02:15:59.220 --> 02:16:05.180]  somewhere in Michigan. Right. And then the five 38 I had that opened in a tab and it
[02:16:05.180 --> 02:16:09.180]  at some point did they bring a needle this year? No. Well, they had a percentage and
[02:16:09.180 --> 02:16:15.240]  at like at like six o'clock Eastern, so around three o'clock your time, they pegged the Democrats
[02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:20.180]  chances of taking the house at like 92% and I was like, that's a pretty good number and
[02:16:20.180 --> 02:16:24.940]  I don't think it's a great number because you said like, would you feel good on an airplane
[02:16:24.940 --> 02:16:31.060]  if there was a 92% chance that it was going to not crash? It's, you know, and but I still
[02:16:31.060 --> 02:16:34.420]  feel pretty good about it because I didn't expect, I had no reason to think that they
[02:16:34.420 --> 02:16:39.340]  would be 99% right. It's, it's like, you know, you look at this, it's, this is even, even
[02:16:39.340 --> 02:16:42.980]  they were saying in their, in their writing out on the podcast, they were saying it's
[02:16:42.980 --> 02:16:46.220]  the same thing that always applies. There could be something somebody missed and it's
[02:16:46.220 --> 02:16:50.000]  not our fault. This is what five 38 tries to say for two years. All we're doing is
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:53.600]  reporting on other people's polls. We evaluate how good the poll is, but we don't control
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:57.540]  the data and the polls. There's always the chance for a systematic error that throws
[02:16:57.540 --> 02:17:02.060]  this completely in one direction or the other and we have no control over it. Well, and
[02:17:02.060 --> 02:17:08.300]  it, you know, the way that we've sorted ourselves left and right with the, you know, the, the,
[02:17:08.300 --> 02:17:15.340]  the, uh, on the Trumpist perspective of denying climate change and not really, they're just
[02:17:15.340 --> 02:17:22.260]  not that fact based, you know, the whole fake news thing that those people surprisingly
[02:17:22.260 --> 02:17:28.260]  unsurprisingly, you know, don't really get math. And so their thing was that, Oh, that,
[02:17:28.260 --> 02:17:32.340]  you know, the, the people who predicted that Hillary Clinton would beat Trump, uh, you
[02:17:32.340 --> 02:17:36.680]  know, like Nate silver and five 38 or do they have egg on their face? Whereas what they
[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:40.940]  said was, you know, it looks like, you know, she has an 80% chance of winning or whatever
[02:17:40.940 --> 02:17:46.300]  it was, 85% whatever the number was. I mean, you do need to reframe these things. If there's
[02:17:46.300 --> 02:17:51.300]  a 15% chance, that means that like 16% is one six, right? That means that's about like
[02:17:51.300 --> 02:17:56.260]  saying, there's the, Oh, there's absolutely no way that this die will land on a five and
[02:17:56.260 --> 02:18:00.380]  you're like, that's insane. Have you ever actually rolled dice? And remember there was
[02:18:00.380 --> 02:18:06.260]  a game, uh, uh, trouble. Remember you pop them out. So you had one, you had one die
[02:18:06.260 --> 02:18:10.860]  in the middle of the thing and you pop it and then you had to like land on certain pegs
[02:18:10.860 --> 02:18:14.660]  exactly. So, you know, you'd be, you know, you're like your sister's ahead of you and
[02:18:14.660 --> 02:18:18.580]  you're playing and it's like, she has to get a one, you know, so every chance, you know,
[02:18:18.580 --> 02:18:22.780]  eventually you get a one, it's not that unusual. So if somebody said to you, you know, I'll
[02:18:22.780 --> 02:18:27.220]  bet you 10 bucks that the next roll of the die won't be a one. Well, I'll take that bet
[02:18:27.220 --> 02:18:31.260]  because you got a five out of six chance. But you know, even with the, I would take
[02:18:31.260 --> 02:18:36.880]  that bet. That's good. It happens, right? So anyway, I'm looking at this and MSNBC comes
[02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:41.940]  on and it seems like it's all bad news. It's, it's voting machines without power cords and
[02:18:41.940 --> 02:18:46.700]  long lines and all these, you see the, the kid, you see Kemp wasn't able to vote because
[02:18:46.700 --> 02:18:49.980]  he had a problem. Yeah, yeah, I did see that. It's hilarious. The guy who was rigging the
[02:18:49.980 --> 02:18:54.040]  elections couldn't even vote because they made these ridiculous voter ID laws that are
[02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:59.220]  transparently designed to keep, uh, uh, just transparently racist. Well, did you see the
[02:18:59.220 --> 02:19:05.700]  thing with North Dakota where they changed the law to, um, require a street address to
[02:19:05.700 --> 02:19:11.780]  vote on the, if you got Avenue instead of road. No, it's the fact that, um, many, many,
[02:19:11.780 --> 02:19:16.860]  many, they don't even have that. You're right. Native address, according to the government,
[02:19:16.860 --> 02:19:21.540]  it's a PO box, but they can't use a PO box. Yes. And it, it only, you know, so they made
[02:19:21.540 --> 02:19:26.060]  this law to literally the only people who are effects are the native Americans in North
[02:19:26.060 --> 02:19:30.500]  Dakota because their, their legal address is a PO box and it's not a street address
[02:19:30.500 --> 02:19:35.100]  because where they live, you know, the reservations where they live don't have streets, you know,
[02:19:35.100 --> 02:19:39.380]  or not streets in the U S whatever. It's not the cannot, it's not the canonical definition
[02:19:39.380 --> 02:19:43.420]  of the location. Not only is it bullshit that they have to show an ID to vote anyway, which
[02:19:43.420 --> 02:19:49.280]  is ridiculous and, and is entirely designed to disenfranchise minorities. They specifically
[02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:56.860]  wrote this street address law to target, uh, native Americans who voted for Heidi. Yeah.
[02:19:56.860 --> 02:20:01.340]  Uh, the last time, which is how, you know, she was writing, she won. Didn't you want
[02:20:01.340 --> 02:20:05.840]  the writing? Yeah. Morkowski Morkowski that in Alaska, but you know, and guess what? She
[02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:10.920]  lost badly. Yeah. But anyway, all this bad news comes in and I thought, well, I'm going
[02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:14.180]  to, you know, I'm not going out to watch TV yet. I'm going to go back to the kitchen.
[02:20:14.180 --> 02:20:18.980]  I'm going to do a little bit more work, but here, let me quick reload five 38 to get that
[02:20:18.980 --> 02:20:23.420]  90 something, see where that's at and then I'll feel better. And I reload five 38 and
[02:20:23.420 --> 02:20:32.580]  five 38 was down to like they, it was like 54% chance. I was like, what? I'm like, what?
[02:20:32.580 --> 02:20:37.420]  This was just at 91%. How the hell does this go to 54? And the thing that I remember is
[02:20:37.420 --> 02:20:43.340]  I remember like with the needles and et cetera, all these things in 2016, the jittering on
[02:20:43.340 --> 02:20:47.900]  the needle, they were all so, you know, very strongly in Hillary Clinton's favor. And then
[02:20:47.900 --> 02:20:51.500]  they started moving the other way. And then once they started moving the other way, they
[02:20:51.500 --> 02:20:56.780]  kept going past 50 and it very quickly went down to, yeah, she lost. She's going to remember
[02:20:56.780 --> 02:21:03.540]  that. And so all I can think is this thing that went from 91 to 54 if that keeps going
[02:21:03.540 --> 02:21:10.180]  like it did two years ago, that's going to be down to like 15% in like 20 minutes. And
[02:21:10.180 --> 02:21:15.560]  MSNBC had a needle too. They had like a thing and at one point there's was like 55% or something.
[02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:20.180]  And I'm like, and the needle doesn't even make that much sense. The needle for a Democrat
[02:21:20.180 --> 02:21:25.140]  versus Republican one person presidential contest needle makes sense. Needle for control
[02:21:25.140 --> 02:21:29.460]  of the house or the Senate does not on the face of it make as much sense. I got to tell
[02:21:29.460 --> 02:21:36.980]  you for a couple of hours there, it was extraordinarily nervous to use and you super over notice every
[02:21:36.980 --> 02:21:42.780]  time. Right. I mean there were the races, there were the races where the really high,
[02:21:42.780 --> 02:21:47.060]  the highlight, it looks something like the classic is bit overwork versus Ted Cruz. Nobody
[02:21:47.060 --> 02:21:50.600]  ever really, really, really super thought he was going to win. But like it would have
[02:21:50.600 --> 02:21:55.940]  been the total package. Cause you know, Ted, Ted Cruz is, is, is, I don't know. He's, he's,
[02:21:55.940 --> 02:21:59.900]  he's a suit on a blob fish. Like just he, and he's such a repellent human being. Even
[02:21:59.900 --> 02:22:05.020]  his colleagues don't like him. Bit of a work is arguably the future of the progressive.
[02:22:05.020 --> 02:22:07.720]  And it's like, that would have been like, you know, that's a, that's like the same about
[02:22:07.720 --> 02:22:11.540]  Marvel movies. That's like a four quadrant win. You can't help. And then when you see
[02:22:11.540 --> 02:22:15.820]  he's not going to win, you're like, well, I still, I damn it. Why was I hopeful? Why
[02:22:15.820 --> 02:22:20.180]  was I hopeful? And I think I under noticed, I don't jump ahead, but I think I under noticed
[02:22:20.180 --> 02:22:23.900]  the number of things that were actually going super well. Yep. Over noticed the stuff that
[02:22:23.900 --> 02:22:27.820]  was not going flawlessly and had no idea how many things there wouldn't be a count until
[02:22:27.820 --> 02:22:31.220]  later in the week, which is also getting very interesting. And the other thing that really
[02:22:31.220 --> 02:22:35.860]  put me in a bad mood Tuesday night where the results from Florida, which is on the East
[02:22:35.860 --> 02:22:40.220]  coast, I guess they, they close polls early, maybe seven o'clock ish or something. It's
[02:22:40.220 --> 02:22:45.140]  a mild where I used to live. It was the West coast. And where I used to live the West coast
[02:22:45.140 --> 02:22:48.940]  of Florida, the Gulf coast is what screwed it up. They had a governor race and they had
[02:22:48.940 --> 02:22:52.860]  a Senate race and the polls had said the Democrats are looking, you know, it's always Florida.
[02:22:52.860 --> 02:22:59.460]  So a big win is going to be 51 49, you know? Right. It's a large, it's a large state, but
[02:22:59.460 --> 02:23:05.020]  it's a very, yeah, it is bizarrely, but famously all the way back to 2000 feet, you know, where
[02:23:05.020 --> 02:23:11.460]  George W. Bush won by like a vote, uh, one quote, uh, uh, you know, however they had
[02:23:11.460 --> 02:23:15.220]  done that recount though, if they had done a full recount, nobody was going to win by
[02:23:15.220 --> 02:23:18.500]  more than a couple of hundred votes. You could do a recount three or four different times.
[02:23:18.500 --> 02:23:23.700]  And if you did a thorough, thorough hand recount, an actual manual, thorough hand recount three
[02:23:23.700 --> 02:23:27.380]  times, you'd get three different results. But if there's enough votes involved that
[02:23:27.380 --> 02:23:31.300]  I bet it would be different. It's just bizarrely 50 50. So you knew it was going to be, but
[02:23:31.300 --> 02:23:35.460]  everything went badly Tuesday in Florida. The Republican had been looking good for a
[02:23:35.460 --> 02:23:40.220]  couple of days. It looked like Gillum might do it right. The Republican one, uh, it's
[02:23:40.220 --> 02:23:45.060]  Rick Scott. He was the one, the Senate race and he's a real piece. He's a real piece of
[02:23:45.060 --> 02:23:49.140]  work. Yeah. And it's like, how the hell did this happen? How does Florida get to screw
[02:23:49.140 --> 02:23:54.700]  us again? And you just, I couldn't help but feel like I was like, well, a Florida, the
[02:23:54.700 --> 02:23:59.260]  polls, you know, we're a little bit skewed in the Democrats favor. This is obviously
[02:23:59.260 --> 02:24:03.660]  going to apply elsewhere. I think we might be screwed. And then James Carville came on
[02:24:03.660 --> 02:24:09.540]  the MSNBC and I love James Carville. I really do love him. I enjoy the way he talks. I think
[02:24:09.540 --> 02:24:15.160]  he's incredibly astute. But I remember that he was the guy like at the, he was the guy
[02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:20.940]  two years ago who at a moment where everybody, whether we should or should not have, whether
[02:24:20.940 --> 02:24:26.580]  we were in denial or just late, but everybody was still thinking, well, Trump's can't really
[02:24:26.580 --> 02:24:30.060]  win this. Right. Okay. So it's closer than we thought, but he can't really win. It was
[02:24:30.060 --> 02:24:36.220]  James Carville who came on MSNBC and was like, uh, I'm not going to do his accent, but yeah.
[02:24:36.220 --> 02:24:39.580]  More or less was like, uh, yeah, this looks really bad. He said the thing, he said the
[02:24:39.580 --> 02:24:42.460]  thing, a, that nobody wanted to hear that B turned out to be true, right? He did it
[02:24:42.460 --> 02:24:46.940]  fairly early. And then having him do that a second time, you're just like, oh, come
[02:24:46.940 --> 02:24:51.300]  on. Yeah. So he came on and he was like, yeah, this isn't going to be a blue wave. This,
[02:24:51.300 --> 02:24:54.140]  this could turn out bad. I think we've got to get our heads wrapped around the fact that
[02:24:54.140 --> 02:24:58.680]  we may not take, you know, Democrats may not take the house. I gotta tell you at that point
[02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:06.360]  I was like, I did not know what to do. Yeah. And then, you know, and then it all turned
[02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:10.380]  out okay. Did you notice that one thing I don't think, I think everybody had to notice,
[02:25:10.380 --> 02:25:16.260]  I don't see how you couldn't notice is as they start calling individual house races
[02:25:16.260 --> 02:25:19.540]  and they're calling them from, you know, they had this list of, here's the 50 that that
[02:25:19.540 --> 02:25:23.140]  are toss ups. Here's the, you know, here's the ones, these are the 50 races that are
[02:25:23.140 --> 02:25:26.480]  going to determine this. There's a, there's a bunch of, for a variety of reasons are like
[02:25:26.480 --> 02:25:30.740]  they're uncontested, they're already settled or in some cases there's, you know, somebody
[02:25:30.740 --> 02:25:34.160]  like Ocasio-Cortez, like we're not going to talk a lot about that because that's pretty
[02:25:34.160 --> 02:25:38.600]  much baked in that she's going to win. Right. Because it's a democratic district. Like in
[02:25:38.600 --> 02:25:43.660]  our district here where our representative is a fellow named Dwight Evans, who's, I think
[02:25:43.660 --> 02:25:47.740]  he's not nationally known too well. I mean, there's a lot of house members who aren't,
[02:25:47.740 --> 02:25:52.640]  you know, but he seems like a very good politician. He's, you know, he's been around, I forget
[02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:55.700]  how, how many times he's been elected. He's not real old, but he's, you know, at least
[02:25:55.700 --> 02:26:01.740]  five, five times his expected vote percentage according to five 38 and our district was
[02:26:01.740 --> 02:26:07.940]  97 in other words, the, the expectation was he would, he would get 97% of the votes in
[02:26:07.940 --> 02:26:11.280]  our district. Oh my goodness. So that was not, I'm not going to spend a whole lot of
[02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:15.340]  time on that. We live in a very blue district. Who's your representative? Did you vote for
[02:26:15.340 --> 02:26:21.340]  is Nancy Pelosi your representative? Uh, well our, our, let's see, who's our, uh, I voted
[02:26:21.340 --> 02:26:25.860]  for di-fi again. I got a, I got a soft spot for di-fi in the Senate and who did I vote
[02:26:25.860 --> 02:26:30.500]  for? I don't remember who I voted for in the rep. I mean here, my stuff is a lot less interesting
[02:26:30.500 --> 02:26:35.380]  than my friends in Chicago where they're a real difference can be made. So we were very
[02:26:35.380 --> 02:26:40.700]  focused on some of the, uh, uh, the, what do they call it in California? The, uh, not
[02:26:40.700 --> 02:26:43.620]  the amendments, but the proposition. Yeah. Cause there's some very interesting propositions
[02:26:43.620 --> 02:26:50.000]  in the city and the state. But it's, um, there's a lot of like very like a downcard stuff,
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.860]  you know, like, oh, real, real worried about who's going to be the assessor, you know,
[02:26:52.860 --> 02:26:57.540]  that school board judges. But no, I mean those here, there's not, I mean you want to show
[02:26:57.540 --> 02:27:01.880]  up and do your duty, but we do not have a giant impact. The people who really wanted
[02:27:01.880 --> 02:27:07.380]  Kevin de Leon over a di-fi I think are probably certainly understandably disappointed. They
[02:27:07.380 --> 02:27:12.380]  really wanted, you know, somebody more progressive and not 80 in there. Um, but that was, that
[02:27:12.380 --> 02:27:16.380]  was pretty much it where there was nothing. The most, the most well known things around
[02:27:16.380 --> 02:27:22.580]  here was some called Prop C where, um, Benioff in particular from, um, Salesforce was trying
[02:27:22.580 --> 02:27:28.180]  to get this tax that would help with homeless issues, which passed, uh, but not by enough
[02:27:28.180 --> 02:27:33.440]  to be like, um, I want to say veto proof. Like it's still, there's no, still no guarantee
[02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:37.180]  it'll happen. It can still be like sort of litigated. You know, what was it? What was
[02:27:37.180 --> 02:27:43.280]  a weird result was the, um, the proposition in Florida to restore voting rights to felons
[02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:47.300]  who have served their times. I was very happy to hear that, but I don't know, understand.
[02:27:47.300 --> 02:27:52.340]  So it's good and it's right because the, you know, the idea that once it's weird that it's
[02:27:52.340 --> 02:27:56.960]  a state decision, right? But if somebody in a felony, I think a priori, I think of a felony
[02:27:56.960 --> 02:28:01.460]  is like a national federal offense. I know that's not the case, but you know, and it's,
[02:28:01.460 --> 02:28:04.460]  you know, you've served your time. You should be, you know, you're done. If they say you
[02:28:04.460 --> 02:28:08.660]  have to go to jail for 10 years and then your 10 years are up and then you're, you, you,
[02:28:08.660 --> 02:28:13.060]  you know, it doesn't seem, it really seems like a condition of parole. Like you're done.
[02:28:13.060 --> 02:28:16.860]  You've done what you're, you're, you're done serving. It seems right on the surface in
[02:28:16.860 --> 02:28:21.140]  just unjust that you never get to vote again for the rest of your life until you, unless
[02:28:21.140 --> 02:28:24.660]  you get, I guess, move out of the state or something. I guess if you move, right? Cause
[02:28:24.660 --> 02:28:28.740]  then you'd be out of that. Well, but that's not what people should have to do. And it's
[02:28:28.740 --> 02:28:32.500]  unjust and interesting that it made it that far and super interesting that it passed for
[02:28:32.500 --> 02:28:36.680]  all the obvious reasons. It's passed. Like it got like 64% of the vote and all I can
[02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:40.980]  think is who voted for this and then still voted for the Republicans for the other thing
[02:28:40.980 --> 02:28:48.300]  because it was, I know you're right. Yeah, it's so nuts. Yeah, very nuts. I don't, the
[02:28:48.300 --> 02:28:52.180]  thing that, the thing that I had, I went to bed that night going meh, like, uh, I was,
[02:28:52.180 --> 02:28:55.000]  this could have gotten better. But even by the time I had recorded with Syracuse that
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:58.720]  night and so I'd missed a lot of the Sturm and Drang. But even by the end of the night
[02:28:58.720 --> 02:29:02.300]  I was like, wait a minute, this isn't as bad as everybody's making it sound. This could
[02:29:02.300 --> 02:29:07.420]  be, this could be way terrible. And I hadn't really thought through what it might mean
[02:29:07.420 --> 02:29:13.300]  if the Democrats get the, let's be honest, get the chairmanships of a lot of those committees.
[02:29:13.300 --> 02:29:18.420]  Just getting rid of Devin Nunez. That improves my day. He's a very bad person. I'm not, I'm
[02:29:18.420 --> 02:29:22.860]  not the hugest Adam Schiff fan. I think he's never seen a camera he didn't love, but like
[02:29:22.860 --> 02:29:27.140]  he, he might as well be working for MSNBC, but I think he's a damn sight better than
[02:29:27.140 --> 02:29:31.980]  Devin Nunez in that case. Well, I think he's a smart guy and that's the difference. And
[02:29:31.980 --> 02:29:36.520]  I do think, yeah, you're right. He likes to be on camera, but it's like, yeah, exactly.
[02:29:36.520 --> 02:29:40.380]  He's not a cipher for, for Donald Trump. But, but yeah, I hadn't really thought through
[02:29:40.380 --> 02:29:43.620]  all that. And then, you know, there was, there were really some bright signs and it took
[02:29:43.620 --> 02:29:46.820]  until the next day and people were reminding you, Hey, this is the first, you know, African
[02:29:46.820 --> 02:29:50.380]  American woman in this role, the first Muslim woman in this role. There was a lot of stuff
[02:29:50.380 --> 02:29:55.140]  like that that we missed in the lights because we wanted the coup de gras. We wanted this
[02:29:55.140 --> 02:30:00.340]  to be dumb liberal cucks like me are sitting around waiting for a daddy to shoot the silver
[02:30:00.340 --> 02:30:05.220]  bullet into the bad man. And that's not how politics works. Colorado, Colorado elected
[02:30:05.220 --> 02:30:10.980]  an openly gay governor, uh, first in the nation that's going to be governing over the people
[02:30:10.980 --> 02:30:15.220]  who wouldn't make the cake. It's, it's so much so being real, he's been real classy
[02:30:15.220 --> 02:30:19.740]  about it too. So many great things like that. And the thing I noticed it was that as they
[02:30:19.740 --> 02:30:23.740]  start calling these individual house races, and here's another one that flipped, here's
[02:30:23.740 --> 02:30:26.980]  another one that flipped for the Democrats and all of a sudden it started looking good
[02:30:26.980 --> 02:30:31.700]  and the needle started looking, you know, it was like 80% chance and it's like, Oh,
[02:30:31.700 --> 02:30:38.340]  it's back off 50 50 was how many of the ones who flipped it were women. It was, it's just
[02:30:38.340 --> 02:30:43.820]  nuts how it was a woman after a woman after a woman who were winning these seats. And
[02:30:43.820 --> 02:30:49.340]  uh, I'm not surprised by that, but I thought it was just a revelation how it was just one
[02:30:49.340 --> 02:30:55.020]  after another. You're not going to hurt. Right. I mean, that's we, that is the energy and
[02:30:55.020 --> 02:30:59.960]  I'm, I don't want to be an essentialist or trying to, uh, I don't want to be unintentionally
[02:30:59.960 --> 02:31:03.700]  sexist by saying all women are the same cause they're not. But there's been a lot of times
[02:31:03.700 --> 02:31:07.920]  in the last two years, a bit last time, a lot of time in the last 200 years where we
[02:31:07.920 --> 02:31:11.740]  really could have used some super smart women on the job. Yeah. And that's nice to see.
[02:31:11.740 --> 02:31:15.220]  That is so nice to see. Yeah. And I think it's great. I think it's going to be good
[02:31:15.220 --> 02:31:19.640]  governing wise, but I also think it was great that it was, it was a winning, it was a winning
[02:31:19.640 --> 02:31:23.980]  politically, you know, that it was a great way to win these seats. There also were some
[02:31:23.980 --> 02:31:30.100]  good schadenfreude is we lost him in the lights, but fricking Scott Walker. Yeah, he's done.
[02:31:30.100 --> 02:31:34.300]  He's out. That's so good. Dana Rohrabacher who might as well work for Vladimir Putin.
[02:31:34.300 --> 02:31:40.180]  I'm so glad Rohrabacher lost. That makes me so happy. I don't even think it's a joke.
[02:31:40.180 --> 02:31:44.060]  I actually think that he works for Vladimir Putin. I remember there was, they had that
[02:31:44.060 --> 02:31:47.580]  recording of the one guy and he was like recording where they joked about and now and the other
[02:31:47.580 --> 02:31:51.700]  guy's lives like the one guy and he was like, oh Ryan, Ryan was making jokes about it. There's
[02:31:51.700 --> 02:31:55.420]  two people that are on the payroll for Putin, right? Trump and Rohrabacher and they laughed
[02:31:55.420 --> 02:31:59.380]  and he goes, no, wait, I'm not joking. Like I really do think that this guy's on the take
[02:31:59.380 --> 02:32:04.260]  from the Russians. Yeah. There was so many, so many bad people who lost. Scott Walker
[02:32:04.260 --> 02:32:10.460]  losing is terrific. It was a good election. It was a good election. Absolutely. Absolutely.
[02:32:10.460 --> 02:32:13.320]  And I mean, and listen, I don't want to, if anything I've learned at this point is not
[02:32:13.320 --> 02:32:18.260]  to whistle past the graveyard. No, it sucks. It sucks that that Gillum didn't win. That
[02:32:18.260 --> 02:32:21.980]  would have been huge. It sucks that Beto O'Rourke didn't win. It's, it's all I can do not to
[02:32:21.980 --> 02:32:25.780]  be exactly that kind of centrist lefty who drives me nuts. But in my back of my head
[02:32:25.780 --> 02:32:29.960]  I am thinking, Oh, Beto O'Rourke and Gillum. Yeah. I'm kind of an interesting idea because
[02:32:29.960 --> 02:32:35.060]  of course as we keep hearing emerging this idea that from future future presidents like
[02:32:35.060 --> 02:32:38.580]  Michael Avenatti, we keep hearing about how, Oh dear, we can't have a woman running for
[02:32:38.580 --> 02:32:43.580]  the democratic seat. I hope that's not the case. But if you're going to have, I, I loved
[02:32:43.580 --> 02:32:49.020]  Joe Biden. I love uncle Joe. I'm Joseph Gordon Biden. Big fan. Hope he doesn't run. Hope
[02:32:49.020 --> 02:32:55.420]  he doesn't run too strong. I want to see people like Beto and Gillum. Yeah. I think that's
[02:32:55.420 --> 02:32:59.760]  a powerful combination. As we stand here today, that's a powerful combination. It reminds
[02:32:59.760 --> 02:33:09.260]  me a lot of a Barack Obama circa 2004 and I remember the cause like his sort of introduction
[02:33:09.260 --> 02:33:14.740]  to the national stage was so 2004 John Kerry was the democratic candidate and one of the
[02:33:14.740 --> 02:33:19.460]  nights, you know, like Tuesday night of the democratic convention, the big speech was
[02:33:19.460 --> 02:33:26.460]  delivered by this young up and coming Senate candidate from Chicago, Barack Obama. Right.
[02:33:26.460 --> 02:33:30.500]  And you know, I was just like, wow, that's, you know, that's it. That's a tough name to,
[02:33:30.500 --> 02:33:34.060]  you know, to be a black guy running for the national stage. A lot of people forget Barack
[02:33:34.060 --> 02:33:37.780]  Hussein Obama, right? That is important, right? The Democrats didn't really emphasize that
[02:33:37.780 --> 02:33:42.420]  part of it in 2004, but I'd never heard of the guy and I, you know, we're watching and
[02:33:42.420 --> 02:33:48.540]  he delivered and you know what we in hindsight we recognize as a terrific Barack Obama speech
[02:33:48.540 --> 02:33:53.300]  and I remember me and Amy just looking at each other saying like, why aren't we running
[02:33:53.300 --> 02:33:58.100]  this guy? Like, right, right, right. I think John Kerry would have been a fine president.
[02:33:58.100 --> 02:34:03.820]  Doesn't really be fine at being the administrator of something. He doesn't really start the
[02:34:03.820 --> 02:34:08.700]  blood, right? He doesn't make you stand up and to have, you know, wipe tears from your
[02:34:08.700 --> 02:34:13.700]  eyes. Whereas Barack Obama did. And in 2004 it was like, I think this guy's going to be
[02:34:13.700 --> 02:34:19.600]  the first black president and we're, you know, we, you know, we were both like, I think this
[02:34:19.600 --> 02:34:22.580]  guy could do it. And then we're like, no, there's never going to be a black president
[02:34:22.580 --> 02:34:26.380]  in our lifetime. So just because, right, because we're awful because we're an awful country
[02:34:26.380 --> 02:34:30.700]  is going to, you know, we're going to have Bush, we're going to have more Bush brothers
[02:34:30.700 --> 02:34:37.580]  for 40 years. Right. Those Bush boys are back. But it just, and Beto O'Rourke has that same
[02:34:37.580 --> 02:34:41.260]  effect on me. Like I just listened to this guy and I'm like, you may not beat Ted Cruz
[02:34:41.260 --> 02:34:46.420]  in this election, you know, because it's Texas and it's, you know, but boy, oh boy, are you
[02:34:46.420 --> 02:34:51.500]  inspiring. And you know, boy, do you have good things to say and do you, I'm ready to,
[02:34:51.500 --> 02:34:58.020]  I'm ready to see a lot more youth and I'm, I, I don't know. I don't, I think you and
[02:34:58.020 --> 02:35:01.540]  I differ a little on this. I see that I don't want to be offensive. I see you as a little
[02:35:01.540 --> 02:35:10.140]  more of a centrist progress in like, but you know what? I mean, I, I'm, I have great respect
[02:35:10.140 --> 02:35:14.340]  for Chuck Schumer. I don't think he's the guy we need in that job right now. I think
[02:35:14.340 --> 02:35:18.700]  there are, there are people like that where I like, oh my goodness, you are just going
[02:35:18.700 --> 02:35:24.140]  to apologize your way into oblivion. You've got to fight. There's no reason for us not
[02:35:24.140 --> 02:35:29.900]  to fight at this point. There's nothing, I mean, how much will be gained by not fighting?
[02:35:29.900 --> 02:35:34.300]  I mean, you just, they just, they sound a practically apologetic that they, they want
[02:35:34.300 --> 02:35:38.460]  these things that America has wanted for years. Like what is, what is the powder you're keeping
[02:35:38.460 --> 02:35:42.700]  dry at this point? What do you think they're going to do to you? I don't know. I'm with
[02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:47.740]  you. And that's the, I, so I mean the idea of somebody, um, people who are going to rub
[02:35:47.740 --> 02:35:51.600]  some people the wrong way, if you want it, you want to start turning out more than a,
[02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:56.380]  you know, low to low two digits of young people, put somebody out there that'll get them out
[02:35:56.380 --> 02:36:00.380]  of that off their ass and not worried about whether they can find stamps to buy. They
[02:36:00.380 --> 02:36:03.180]  will come out and they will do that. You know that you need somebody who's going to make
[02:36:03.180 --> 02:36:09.940]  them excited. The other side doesn't worry about what our side will think of their, their
[02:36:09.940 --> 02:36:16.220]  leaders, right? Like nobody on the Republicans looks at Chuck Grassley leading the Senate
[02:36:16.220 --> 02:36:19.460]  judiciary committee and says, you know what? I worry that Democrats aren't really going
[02:36:19.460 --> 02:36:24.220]  to like this guy. We're, we're, we're in a, there's a phrase we use in our family a lot,
[02:36:24.220 --> 02:36:28.500]  which is, um, sometimes we'll be watching a TV show or a movie and there'll be somebody
[02:36:28.500 --> 02:36:31.740]  who just, it seems, they seem so strange and I'll say, that guy seems like he's in a different
[02:36:31.740 --> 02:36:35.660]  movie right now. He's in a different movie. We're in a different movie than we used to
[02:36:35.660 --> 02:36:41.000]  be. We Chuck, Chuck Schumer and his very, very good, good humans who are, who are leading
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:45.560]  our, uh, the other elected officials, they think they are in a different movie than the
[02:36:45.560 --> 02:36:50.340]  one that they are in. And I really, I don't understand unless I'm really, really missing
[02:36:50.340 --> 02:36:54.460]  something and that's always possible. I think they think they're in a different movie and
[02:36:54.460 --> 02:36:59.620]  I'm, we're in a different genre of movie from a different era of movie. And like the more
[02:36:59.620 --> 02:37:05.740]  the thing is, you know, it's like the closest I can think of is like Margaret Dumont in
[02:37:05.740 --> 02:37:09.960]  a Marx brothers movie, like, like trying, trying to be in like all the president's men
[02:37:09.960 --> 02:37:14.340]  or something. Like, I don't know what the two movies are, but like it's time to fight.
[02:37:14.340 --> 02:37:19.980]  It is. It is. You're not going to get these people, you're not going to win a contest
[02:37:19.980 --> 02:37:24.700]  of like, have you no, have you no shame, sir. Like you are basically, you're fighting the
[02:37:24.700 --> 02:37:29.620]  three stooges and they've got a ladder, right? But now it's at a point where you could ask,
[02:37:29.620 --> 02:37:34.640]  you could have the, do you have no shame, sir? And then they could just look right at,
[02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:38.860]  you know, you know, do that thing where the, the, you speak into your testimony microphone
[02:37:38.860 --> 02:37:44.020]  at a crooked angle and they would just say, no, we, I have no shame. Of course not. Right.
[02:37:44.020 --> 02:37:47.140]  I believe I was stipulated for the record that I have no shame. Right. Like that was,
[02:37:47.140 --> 02:37:52.060]  I'm a stooge. Like they should, I have two associates and the three of us have worked
[02:37:52.060 --> 02:37:57.260]  to do so. Like when Cavanaugh was called back to retestify on that, on that thing. But they
[02:37:57.260 --> 02:38:01.900]  could have asked him like, sir, do you have, you know, shame. And he would have just answered,
[02:38:01.900 --> 02:38:05.580]  you know, I have no shame at all. None. Oh, I mean to go to an extreme, the guys on Chapo
[02:38:05.580 --> 02:38:09.220]  were saying like, well, somebody should have, maybe not Klobuchar, but somebody just sort
[02:38:09.220 --> 02:38:14.420]  of just said, well, the extreme version would be, um, Mr. Kevin, are you drunk right now?
[02:38:14.420 --> 02:38:19.300]  Yeah, I know. Right. Or if you want to be a little more low key about you go, um, Mr.
[02:38:19.300 --> 02:38:23.980]  Cavanaugh, when's the last time you drank any alcohol at all? And you know, the only honest
[02:38:23.980 --> 02:38:30.780]  answer is at least yesterday. I think, I think he did a shot before he came out. I do. I
[02:38:30.780 --> 02:38:35.380]  think the way that he came out hot. Okay. Have me back. It's getting late. Have me back.
[02:38:35.380 --> 02:38:40.460]  I want to land out my theory of how Adderall is running the right at this point. I think
[02:38:40.460 --> 02:38:44.380]  there's a tremendous stimulant addiction problem on the right. And I think the smart money
[02:38:44.380 --> 02:38:50.060]  is on Brett probably had a little too to Adderall and then you decide to shave it down with
[02:38:50.060 --> 02:38:54.180]  a little bit of scotch whiskey. That's my guess. I think he had a one and then the other
[02:38:54.180 --> 02:38:58.500]  did to get them off the clock. I mean, you ever notice how much Trump sniffs? Yeah. Oh
[02:38:58.500 --> 02:39:03.620]  yeah. Oh, all the time. Take Adderall. I used to sniff people sniff. It's not cocaine guys.
[02:39:03.620 --> 02:39:08.980]  Folks. Folks. Folks. Do we love it? Do we love the Adderall? And I thought, you know
[02:39:08.980 --> 02:39:12.820]  where I thought it was super noticeable. Always. I thought I was like, why aren't more people
[02:39:12.820 --> 02:39:16.140]  talking about this was during his debates with Hillary Clinton where he's up there.
[02:39:16.140 --> 02:39:21.060]  He's up there for 90 minutes. Yes. He's got a microphone in front of him for the whole
[02:39:21.060 --> 02:39:25.400]  thing and he's, you know, is there ever a time when he would get want to get keyed up,
[02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:29.220]  you know, and be ready to go. It became a running. It was a running bit for me on Twitter
[02:39:29.220 --> 02:39:33.060]  because I know for a fact that from the time I put an Adderall in my mouth to the time
[02:39:33.060 --> 02:39:37.500]  I felt like a, an Elton John song with wings was exactly 22 minutes. I don't know if they're
[02:39:37.500 --> 02:39:41.500]  count. You could count 22 minutes from the time he started talking. I think he got a
[02:39:41.500 --> 02:39:46.120]  little bump and it would hit him maybe a pill and it would him cause he would suddenly become
[02:39:46.120 --> 02:39:49.700]  extremely interested in what he was saying and he would like come to life from looking
[02:39:49.700 --> 02:39:53.700]  very tired and the man sleeps like three hours a night. Yeah. Well he just tweeted the other
[02:39:53.700 --> 02:39:57.100]  day at four 30 he had a tweet that can, you know, he tweets those himself. I think I wanted
[02:39:57.100 --> 02:40:00.300]  three. Yeah. He had wanted three the other day about his unfair treatment or maybe it
[02:40:00.300 --> 02:40:04.540]  was four, but it was literally, if you look at it like, yeah, it's either really late
[02:40:04.540 --> 02:40:08.220]  or really yourself. Is that healthy? Is that healthy that the president is up at that hour
[02:40:08.220 --> 02:40:14.180]  being aggrieved? Right. Is that what we want from a late night president? Ah, you know,
[02:40:14.180 --> 02:40:18.180]  and yet it's saying also, you notice how much water cabin I was drinking. Yeah. Did you
[02:40:18.180 --> 02:40:23.800]  see water? So we got to wrap it up, but it's just, so Trump had a bizarro press conference
[02:40:23.800 --> 02:40:28.520]  yesterday. He went all over the map from saying that he was going to work with Democrats to
[02:40:28.520 --> 02:40:34.220]  making threats. Again, you investigate me. Maybe I investigate. Yeah. Yeah. We're like
[02:40:34.220 --> 02:40:39.860]  that. I feel like that Nancy Pelosi, I'm going to investigate you. I'm not doing it right
[02:40:39.860 --> 02:40:42.860]  now, but I might, I could do it on the present. I could start investigating. Well, here's
[02:40:42.860 --> 02:40:47.420]  to get you. It fits though with it. It's like a drunk yelling. No, you're under arrest.
[02:40:47.420 --> 02:40:51.100]  No, let me tell you something though. I honestly believe this and I think it's a, it's one
[02:40:51.100 --> 02:40:53.900]  of those ways where like you said, we're in a different movie than these people think
[02:40:53.900 --> 02:41:01.180]  we are the real world today. Democrats look at the word investigation and they see what
[02:41:01.180 --> 02:41:07.340]  the dictionary says an investigation is an inquiry to find the answers to questions.
[02:41:07.340 --> 02:41:11.580]  So the Mueller, sometimes it's just to make sure that everything is as it appears. You
[02:41:11.580 --> 02:41:15.920]  will be investigated if you try to work for the FBI. So they know that everything's copacetic.
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:19.660]  They're not accusing you of anything. Republicans, they just need to investigate it to make sure
[02:41:19.660 --> 02:41:23.740]  everything's what it seems. Republicans, starting with Newt Gingrich back in the nineties, he
[02:41:23.740 --> 02:41:28.220]  sort of pioneered this, see investing, they see the word investigation and they see it
[02:41:28.220 --> 02:41:32.580]  as something that those in political power use against those who don't have political
[02:41:32.580 --> 02:41:37.320]  power. It's, it has nothing to do with the truth. That is nothing. It's just no matter
[02:41:37.320 --> 02:41:41.700]  what the intention is, it's definitely going to be a blanket party that is sets up from
[02:41:41.700 --> 02:41:47.860]  the beginning to undo. And so Trump's thing yesterday just, he's so internalized that
[02:41:47.860 --> 02:41:53.300]  and it comes so naturally to him that it has nothing to do with the fact that he's actually
[02:41:53.300 --> 02:41:58.820]  done illegal things, terribly illegal things, and that his campaign, you know, whether he
[02:41:58.820 --> 02:42:03.260]  knew about them or not, colluded with the Russians in illegal ways and that there's
[02:42:03.260 --> 02:42:06.820]  all sorts of financial, you don't need to go any further than his hotels, right? The
[02:42:06.820 --> 02:42:11.700]  thing that's number 95 on the list is how he and he and his family continue to enrich
[02:42:11.700 --> 02:42:16.060]  themselves because they didn't really get out of any of those businesses that we'll
[02:42:16.060 --> 02:42:19.500]  never even gonna, we won't get to that until they're all dead. But that'll follow David
[02:42:19.500 --> 02:42:24.980]  Fahrenheit on, on, uh, on Twitter and uh, and uh, what, Washington Post. Yeah. And just
[02:42:24.980 --> 02:42:29.740]  watch, watch what happens with that family. And it's, it's absolutely astonishing stuff
[02:42:29.740 --> 02:42:35.340]  that nobody would have gotten away with one time. He has an entire, his progeny are out
[02:42:35.340 --> 02:42:39.520]  there in buildings with his name on it, licensed to have his name on it. They're doing nothing
[02:42:39.520 --> 02:42:43.220]  but putting thousands of dollars in his pocket. Trump's little, do you want to investigate
[02:42:43.220 --> 02:42:47.900]  me? We'll investigate you. I'll investigate you is totally, it was totally in denial of
[02:42:47.900 --> 02:42:52.260]  the fact that like he's done an all, he and his campaign and his government have done
[02:42:52.260 --> 02:42:56.940]  an awful lot of things that are probably going to, you know, result in, well, already have
[02:42:56.940 --> 02:43:02.460]  resulted in a bunch of felonies, uh, an indictment. Uh, and the other side hasn't, but there are
[02:43:02.460 --> 02:43:06.620]  only people in some cases, there were only people that led his campaign or advised his
[02:43:06.620 --> 02:43:12.260]  campaign for a few months. But, and there was a whole, a whole, a whole, you, you, you,
[02:43:12.260 --> 02:43:16.340]  you couldn't fit them on a bus. You know, how many people when Trump won and they, you
[02:43:16.340 --> 02:43:20.260]  know, for two years ago when we had the little holiday party episode of the show and how
[02:43:20.260 --> 02:43:24.300]  many people right away, like with, you know, day after the election we're saying, ah, this
[02:43:24.300 --> 02:43:28.540]  isn't going to be that bad. You know, it's, ah, you're crazy if you think that, uh, that
[02:43:28.540 --> 02:43:32.740]  they're going, it's going to be like, there's so many fail safes and fire alarms and nets
[02:43:32.740 --> 02:43:36.860]  that keep this from going wrong. Now here we are two years later, the day after this
[02:43:36.860 --> 02:43:42.340]  election, people on the Supreme court, but they like to me of, of the list of things
[02:43:42.340 --> 02:43:46.700]  that we were, that I was like two years ago. Oh yeah, they're going to do this. They're
[02:43:46.700 --> 02:43:51.060]  going to do things like this. And then here we are yesterday, they, they revoke the press
[02:43:51.060 --> 02:43:58.700]  pass to a reporter from CNN. Yeah. And the, the white house press secretary, Sarah Sanders
[02:43:58.700 --> 02:44:03.540]  posted a video. Here's, she said, here's why we have to revoke his video, a doctor video,
[02:44:03.540 --> 02:44:11.420]  a doctor video, the white house. And this isn't an allegation that the, the original
[02:44:11.420 --> 02:44:19.220]  video is out there. You can see the original video, you can see how they doctored it. And
[02:44:19.220 --> 02:44:23.940]  that's, you know, again, you know, on the same, on the same day that at least it was
[02:44:23.940 --> 02:44:29.340]  announced that Jeff sessions had been asked to quit, had been essentially fired the day.
[02:44:29.340 --> 02:44:33.580]  It's like almost like he's waiting. When can I, when can I let the Keebler out go? It has
[02:44:33.580 --> 02:44:37.820]  to be after the midterm, sir. And the midterms end when, uh, well, sir, I guess technically
[02:44:37.820 --> 02:44:41.820]  that would be sometime he won't be fully counted, but after 12, okay, fine, I'll do it then.
[02:44:41.820 --> 02:44:45.900]  And that's, and that's a Keebler man is gone on that undated letter that's been weirdly
[02:44:45.900 --> 02:44:52.060]  sitting around undated letter. You know, I, I, I date notes to my wife that I put on the
[02:44:52.060 --> 02:44:57.740]  refrigerator. I don't think official resignation letters get passed around without a date on
[02:44:57.740 --> 02:45:03.760]  them. What is happening? I need a holiday party. I think, I think, I don't know if everything's
[02:45:03.760 --> 02:45:07.940]  going to be fine. I think it's not going to be fine. I do feel God, I hate to say this
[02:45:07.940 --> 02:45:11.300]  because I'm so obsessed with the Russia stuff, but I've come around to what a lot of people
[02:45:11.300 --> 02:45:15.660]  say, you know, let the Russia stuff play, play out its course. Having shift and his
[02:45:15.660 --> 02:45:19.700]  team in there is going to make a big difference, but don't lose that in the lights. Don't put
[02:45:19.700 --> 02:45:23.460]  all your hope. Robert Mueller is not Superman. There's only so much that's going to happen.
[02:45:23.460 --> 02:45:27.380]  And like my friend Max says, stay focused on stuff that you can do something about stuff
[02:45:27.380 --> 02:45:31.920]  in your area. Maybe even pick one thing. Don't be like the press. You guys don't chase every
[02:45:31.920 --> 02:45:35.220]  tennis ball. I mean, we're doing that now. We're having fun, but if you want to make
[02:45:35.220 --> 02:45:38.940]  a difference, you can't, you can't fret about everything. You got to fret about one thing
[02:45:38.940 --> 02:45:44.420]  or two things. Well, you know, yeah, we got to keep, you can just drink a lot. Well, I
[02:45:44.420 --> 02:45:50.060]  tried that two years ago. Didn't know it worked for a little while. I will say this. Let me
[02:45:50.060 --> 02:45:55.140]  say this because you'll be back on before the 2020 election, but God willing. Yeah.
[02:45:55.140 --> 02:46:00.180]  Yeah. Do you think Trump is going to run for reelection? I think there's a serious chance
[02:46:00.180 --> 02:46:04.280]  that he doesn't run for reelection. Boy, there's, this is one that I really had to change my
[02:46:04.280 --> 02:46:10.620]  mind on. Um, I, John Gruber, I, as we recorded that program approximately two years ago,
[02:46:10.620 --> 02:46:13.940]  I thought he'd be in it for six months. I thought there's no reason to believe he will
[02:46:13.940 --> 02:46:17.560]  be in there for more than six months. He will be impeached because he's already got a big
[02:46:17.560 --> 02:46:21.740]  stack of crimes. I made crimes. He made tons of crimes. He shouldn't be in there in the
[02:46:21.740 --> 02:46:25.040]  first place. He's got obviously going to be impeached. They made Jimmy Carter sell his
[02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:31.720]  peanut farm. He sold his peanut farm, retired world war two veteran that worked on submarines
[02:46:31.720 --> 02:46:36.600]  had to sell his peanut farm. This guy looks at you. This guy looks like a child's craft
[02:46:36.600 --> 02:46:40.740]  project in his video. Anyway, this guy opened a hotel with his name on it across the street
[02:46:40.740 --> 02:46:47.140]  from the white house. I can't have the FBI there. I know. I know. It's really easy. You
[02:46:47.140 --> 02:46:52.300]  can just use a little Elon Musk tunnel to move in between and a golf cart anyways. Uh,
[02:46:52.300 --> 02:46:55.980]  and so I thought there's no way he'll be in there six months. I was a little surprised
[02:46:55.980 --> 02:46:59.540]  that he made it more than six months. And then I thought, well, you remember what we
[02:46:59.540 --> 02:47:02.760]  all were saying toward the end when it was quote unquote, so obvious he wasn't going
[02:47:02.760 --> 02:47:06.860]  to win. We were like, oh, he's never, he's never going to stick this out because he has
[02:47:06.860 --> 02:47:10.820]  to do financial disclosures. He's never going to stick this out because if there's any chance
[02:47:10.820 --> 02:47:14.020]  he's not going to win, you know, he's not going to do it. Right. Remember all that talk
[02:47:14.020 --> 02:47:18.060]  and all that chatter. And then he did stay in and nobody was more surprised than him
[02:47:18.060 --> 02:47:24.420]  that he won. But I, I, I, I want to hear what you say about this because I think he definitely
[02:47:24.420 --> 02:47:28.380]  is planning to run again and I think he is definitely planning to win again. I think
[02:47:28.380 --> 02:47:34.300]  he never feels more alive and not terrible about himself than when he's in front of a
[02:47:34.300 --> 02:47:40.220]  rally crowd. Yep. And that's, that's just like, that's fudge for dinner every night
[02:47:40.220 --> 02:47:44.740]  for the last next two years for him. Can he do the rallies even if he isn't running? I
[02:47:44.740 --> 02:47:50.100]  think he could. He is running his reelection started in January of 2017. Yeah, but I see
[02:47:50.100 --> 02:47:54.380]  I think he'll probably win. Like if you want me to just bet money, yes or no, will he be
[02:47:54.380 --> 02:47:58.780]  on the ballot two years from now? I've given a ball. He's definitely going to win. I don't
[02:47:58.780 --> 02:48:03.220]  think so because we're going to have 16 people on our side splitting every conceivable vote.
[02:48:03.220 --> 02:48:08.740]  I think we'll get behind it. And I also think if you look at the actual way that he, well,
[02:48:08.740 --> 02:48:13.580]  Florida is Florida and Florida looks, you know, obviously came up red Tuesday, but Pennsylvania
[02:48:13.580 --> 02:48:19.700]  went super blue. We, cause the district changes, right? Yeah. District changes, changed lots
[02:48:19.700 --> 02:48:26.460]  of stuff. Pennsylvania did itself proud after helping to elect Trump two years ago, but
[02:48:26.460 --> 02:48:32.000]  we got a democratic governor, reelected democratic senator, reelected, neither of whom even really
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:37.700]  had serious opposition. Wasn't even close. Flipped a bunch of house seats. It was all,
[02:48:37.700 --> 02:48:43.100]  you know, all looked very good. Wisconsin went for Trump in a surprise was usually blue
[02:48:43.100 --> 02:48:47.060]  in presidential elections. Well, Wisconsin got attacked together and kick Scott Walker
[02:48:47.060 --> 02:48:51.420]  out. Anyway, I don't think, I mean, that guy's, that guy was, that guy was hard to get rid
[02:48:51.420 --> 02:48:56.200]  of. I think recall for him. I kept winning. It was crazy. I think when you sit there and
[02:48:56.200 --> 02:48:59.740]  just look at it, look at it state by state and add up the electoral. I mean, it all depends
[02:48:59.740 --> 02:49:03.100]  who the Democrats run. I just think that there is a chance of that. Trump looks at this thing
[02:49:03.100 --> 02:49:08.700]  like, and I losing would be human. I don't think he could handle losing, right? I don't
[02:49:08.700 --> 02:49:13.220]  think that his brain could handle it. It's the w that's what I thought in 16 too though.
[02:49:13.220 --> 02:49:19.500]  And I think that if he, I think if he looks at this and sees it as a loser, I think he
[02:49:19.500 --> 02:49:23.360]  just, I think his out is very obvious. He just just declared, you know, what was his
[02:49:23.360 --> 02:49:28.660]  goal of going in? It was to make America great again. All he says is I did it. It took, it
[02:49:28.660 --> 02:49:32.900]  took one. I only needed one term. I'm so good. I only needed one term. America's great again.
[02:49:32.900 --> 02:49:39.140]  I fixed it. And so I'm out here. He loves, he loves those cheering crowds. And I think
[02:49:39.140 --> 02:49:42.920]  I, I, he doesn't even have to run to get the cheering crowds. He could still go around
[02:49:42.920 --> 02:49:46.780]  the country and have his little rallies. But the other thing that's, I'm not going to say
[02:49:46.780 --> 02:49:51.660]  it's a certainty, but I think of the things that are happening with Russia, how does one
[02:49:51.660 --> 02:49:56.260]  put this? I think there's a pretty good chance that the Russia investigation is going to
[02:49:56.260 --> 02:50:02.780]  touch parts of his family pretty hard. Yeah. I think Don jr looking at jail time, he's
[02:50:02.780 --> 02:50:07.140]  looking at each other, but like even like, so like I don't think Trump's stays up nights
[02:50:07.140 --> 02:50:12.660]  worrying about Roger Stone. No. Um, but I think I hate to admit, yes, I have wanted
[02:50:12.660 --> 02:50:16.620]  this all along. I have wanted to see Jerry Kushner be sad. I've wanted that for a very
[02:50:16.620 --> 02:50:21.820]  long time. And I think those two guys are, have some fairly significant legal exposure.
[02:50:21.820 --> 02:50:26.440]  And if for no other reason, then I don't know. See, he, I'm the one he can't stand to be
[02:50:26.440 --> 02:50:31.820]  a loser in the electoral sense, but he also can't stand to feel like you've beaten him
[02:50:31.820 --> 02:50:36.300]  at anything. I think he could. I think he declares that he, that he, he's not running
[02:50:36.300 --> 02:50:39.640]  that my work, my work is done. It's already great. And then he'll spend the rest of his
[02:50:39.640 --> 02:50:45.380]  life saying that if he had one, if he had run, he would have won. Right. And it, it
[02:50:45.380 --> 02:50:49.140]  wouldn't bet a dollar. Yeah, I'll bet a dollar on this. I'm going to bet a dollar. The dollar
[02:50:49.140 --> 02:50:56.660]  in the bed is the contract is, uh, does Donald Trump run? Well, at what point does he make
[02:50:56.660 --> 02:51:03.780]  it to election day and stay in through election day? 2020? Regardless. Okay. Well, no, because
[02:51:03.780 --> 02:51:07.620]  he'll still be president. He needs to win. Okay. No, I think it's whether he runs your
[02:51:07.620 --> 02:51:12.140]  assistant type it up. I'll agree to whatever it is. Let's just say that, you know, that
[02:51:12.140 --> 02:51:16.120]  the Republican primaries go off and he's, you know, he's on a, you know, he's going
[02:51:16.120 --> 02:51:20.260]  to be the nominee. I thought he would drop out. I really did. I think I just don't think
[02:51:20.260 --> 02:51:23.180]  he runs. I feel like, and then, you know, who knows, maybe this next year we haven't
[02:51:23.180 --> 02:51:32.360]  talked about his health is not healthy. He thinks your body's like a battery. He, I misshapen.
[02:51:32.360 --> 02:51:36.260]  He's a misshapen child's craft project. He doesn't want to waste his energy on exercise.
[02:51:36.260 --> 02:51:39.540]  No, that's why he's, that's why he keeps leaving his phone in the car. He looks like he looks
[02:51:39.540 --> 02:51:44.420]  like he's been, he looks like something came from Michael's crafts. He's, he's lumping.
[02:51:44.420 --> 02:51:51.260]  He's a, he's, uh, I think that if he doesn't run, he never, he's never lost and that he
[02:51:51.260 --> 02:51:55.040]  keeps, he, you know, and he can do the rallies as long as he wants. People would still go
[02:51:55.040 --> 02:52:01.820]  see him. He'll be doing rallies in 2022. No, Jesus. Thanks for having me back. We went
[02:52:01.820 --> 02:52:08.500]  long today. Yeah, it was good. Enjoy your iPad. Thank you very much. You too. You should,
[02:52:08.500 --> 02:52:11.860]  you should tout something. You've got like a dozen podcasts. What do you, you, you've
[02:52:11.860 --> 02:52:16.420]  got, I mentioned do by Friday. You got do by Friday. Friday's there. I really want to
[02:52:16.420 --> 02:52:20.060]  make sure people, people who like this show in particular might enjoy a show. I do with
[02:52:20.060 --> 02:52:25.300]  John Siracusa called a reconcilable differences. That's at relay.fm slash rd. I would, I would
[02:52:25.300 --> 02:52:29.180]  like you to go and check out that show. It's a show I really enjoy doing. And uh, John's
[02:52:29.180 --> 02:52:33.980]  super annoying, but I have a lot of respect. I got to get him back on this show soon. Absolutely.
[02:52:33.980 --> 02:52:37.740]  Yeah. But that, you know, he's got, he's got his video games and stuff. He's busy. That's
[02:52:37.740 --> 02:52:43.300]  a tough one for me because you know, he's a wonderful person, but you know, you gotta
[02:52:43.300 --> 02:52:48.300]  be on your toes. Oh, you sure gotta be on your regular basis. He's got all those flying
[02:52:48.300 --> 02:52:51.340]  monkeys. You think you got flying monkeys? That guy's got flying monkeys, but you say
[02:52:51.340 --> 02:52:57.260]  anything to disappear. John Siracusa. Oh, anyway, it's, you know, we had this, we planned
[02:52:57.260 --> 02:53:02.180]  on doing this after the election all along. There was a moment, I told you there was a
[02:53:02.180 --> 02:53:07.220]  moment Tuesday night where I thought, oh, I'm going to, it's going to be a holiday party.
[02:53:07.220 --> 02:53:11.700]  I would, I would happily come back anytime. I enjoy your program. Uh, I, uh, I'm glad
[02:53:11.700 --> 02:53:15.560]  you're doing this and um, I'm going to be collecting my dollar. I think, I think he
[02:53:15.560 --> 02:53:18.460]  doesn't run.
