[00:00.000 --> 00:02.420]  Dan Fromer, good to have you back on the show.
[00:02.420 --> 00:03.860]  Thank you, long time.
[00:04.740 --> 00:06.180]  Yeah, it feels like it.
[00:06.180 --> 00:09.060]  And Skype is telling me 10 months.
[00:09.060 --> 00:10.300]  I don't know if that's accurate.
[00:10.300 --> 00:12.180]  I think that's right.
[00:12.180 --> 00:15.260]  I know, I do know I didn't see you last week.
[00:15.260 --> 00:16.700]  Oh my gosh, yeah.
[00:18.660 --> 00:21.280]  What a strange, what a strange thing.
[00:22.140 --> 00:23.420]  Let me jump right into it
[00:23.420 --> 00:24.780]  and talk about the keynote a little.
[00:24.780 --> 00:26.120]  I'm still not done talking about it,
[00:26.120 --> 00:30.720]  but here's a quote from your newsletter, The New Consumer,
[00:30.720 --> 00:32.860]  talking about the actual keynote itself,
[00:32.860 --> 00:34.860]  the presentation, sort of the cinema.
[00:34.860 --> 00:35.700]  Here's a quote.
[00:35.700 --> 00:38.800]  Remember how Oceans 11 felt faster and more modern
[00:38.800 --> 00:40.800]  than any heist movie before it.
[00:40.800 --> 00:42.900]  That's what this was like.
[00:42.900 --> 00:45.440]  I love that synopsis of the keynote.
[00:45.440 --> 00:47.580]  I think that that, and again, you could say,
[00:47.580 --> 00:49.900]  well, it's, you know, they're trying to sell you
[00:49.900 --> 00:51.960]  electronic gadgets and operating systems.
[00:51.960 --> 00:54.280]  It's not as cool as Oceans 11.
[00:54.280 --> 00:56.880]  It's the keynote equivalent, though, and it is.
[00:56.880 --> 00:58.060]  It's just faster.
[00:59.980 --> 01:04.980]  Yeah, and I guess they couldn't do it that way
[01:05.380 --> 01:08.640]  if they were still pretending to be talking
[01:08.640 --> 01:11.900]  to a theater of, what is it, 6,000 people
[01:11.900 --> 01:13.700]  or something like that?
[01:13.700 --> 01:14.540]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:14.540 --> 01:17.820]  But because they weren't, and they knew they weren't,
[01:17.820 --> 01:22.820]  they really kind of chopped out all the crowd reaction parts
[01:22.820 --> 01:25.780]  and, you know, they were speaking straight into the camera
[01:25.780 --> 01:29.100]  instead of pretending to be speaking to a room.
[01:29.100 --> 01:30.160]  It really worked.
[01:31.620 --> 01:34.380]  Yeah, I thought it was really interesting.
[01:34.380 --> 01:38.740]  It was, and I felt such a relief
[01:39.580 --> 01:43.180]  as I read other people's takes on it.
[01:43.180 --> 01:48.060]  I listened to ATP's post keynote episode,
[01:48.060 --> 01:51.460]  and having everybody say, hey, that was a lot to digest
[01:51.460 --> 01:55.140]  that went by so fast made me feel better
[01:55.140 --> 01:59.260]  about the fact that I felt overwhelmed when it was over.
[01:59.260 --> 02:02.560]  And I don't think, I still don't think it was too much.
[02:02.560 --> 02:06.600]  I don't think that, you know, if I had to give notes,
[02:06.600 --> 02:09.900]  I would say maybe slow down a little.
[02:09.900 --> 02:14.420]  But the other problem that they have with these keynotes,
[02:14.420 --> 02:16.380]  whether they're live in, you know,
[02:16.380 --> 02:19.900]  like regular traditional ones or this one that's virtual,
[02:19.900 --> 02:24.420]  is in terms of deciding what makes the cut
[02:24.420 --> 02:29.420]  for the keynote or not, it's not like writing a movie
[02:30.100 --> 02:31.980]  or maybe it's sort of like adapting a book
[02:31.980 --> 02:34.100]  or something like that where the book is, you know,
[02:34.100 --> 02:36.460]  700 pages and there's a lot of plot points
[02:36.460 --> 02:40.420]  and somehow you gotta make it, you know, two hours.
[02:40.420 --> 02:43.860]  They have, here's the list of everything they're doing
[02:43.860 --> 02:47.500]  for the next year across all of these platforms.
[02:47.500 --> 02:50.420]  They're doing it whether it makes the keynote or not.
[02:50.420 --> 02:51.900]  So it's like you could say, all right,
[02:51.900 --> 02:55.100]  we're gonna cut this feature from the keynote.
[02:55.100 --> 02:57.340]  We're not even gonna mention it too much.
[02:57.340 --> 02:58.900]  That doesn't mean the feature isn't there
[02:58.900 --> 03:00.220]  and those of us who wanna cover it
[03:00.220 --> 03:04.380]  still have to figure it out eventually anyway.
[03:04.380 --> 03:08.620]  So it's a hard thing to give notes on, you know.
[03:08.620 --> 03:11.260]  Did they pack too much into the keynote?
[03:11.260 --> 03:13.740]  Well, and it's just interesting how different it is
[03:13.740 --> 03:16.180]  than, you know, three or four or five years ago
[03:16.180 --> 03:18.060]  when, I don't know if you remember,
[03:18.060 --> 03:20.660]  but like they would start the iOS segment
[03:20.660 --> 03:24.020]  and they'd be like, all right, we've got 12 new tent poles
[03:24.020 --> 03:25.340]  or whatever it is and they would have
[03:25.340 --> 03:26.740]  all those icons on the screen.
[03:26.740 --> 03:28.220]  I think this year it was like two or three
[03:28.220 --> 03:30.820]  or something like that and instead,
[03:30.820 --> 03:32.480]  they're like kind of opening up new worlds
[03:32.480 --> 03:35.420]  like this whole concept of widgets
[03:35.420 --> 03:37.820]  which, you know, you could theoretically
[03:37.820 --> 03:39.420]  spend two hours just on widgets
[03:39.420 --> 03:40.860]  and I'm sure, I haven't had a chance
[03:40.860 --> 03:43.880]  to watch the technical videos from those sessions
[03:43.880 --> 03:46.820]  but I'm sure there's some pretty interesting stuff there
[03:46.820 --> 03:48.660]  but it's not like the old days where it's like,
[03:48.660 --> 03:51.900]  and now we have FaceTime or, you know,
[03:51.900 --> 03:53.740]  all these changes coming to the Mail app
[03:53.740 --> 03:54.860]  or something like that.
[03:56.140 --> 04:00.020]  Yeah, it seemed, I don't know if 10 was the magic number
[04:00.020 --> 04:02.260]  but it always felt to me like a lot of times
[04:02.260 --> 04:04.320]  they'd have 10 features like, you know,
[04:04.320 --> 04:07.120]  maybe it was a Steve Jobs axiom, you know,
[04:07.120 --> 04:09.580]  that let's pick 10 tent poles
[04:09.580 --> 04:13.020]  and, you know, you can imagine the prep sessions
[04:13.020 --> 04:16.020]  and the weeks leading up to the big announcement
[04:16.020 --> 04:18.180]  where, you know, there's 20 and all right,
[04:18.180 --> 04:20.420]  here's the 20, all right, we'll cut these two.
[04:20.420 --> 04:24.260]  Now we're down to 18, next meeting get it down to 15,
[04:24.260 --> 04:26.760]  you know, and eventually you get it down to the 10.
[04:28.180 --> 04:30.180]  This felt a little bit more aggressive than that.
[04:30.180 --> 04:31.260]  I think you're right, I don't think,
[04:31.260 --> 04:33.140]  I wouldn't say there were 10 tent poles
[04:33.140 --> 04:34.780]  for any of these things.
[04:34.780 --> 04:37.100]  I guess maybe the watch had a few things,
[04:37.100 --> 04:40.660]  you know, it's a platform that's still kind of
[04:40.660 --> 04:44.100]  less developed whereas iOS, like, you know,
[04:44.100 --> 04:47.460]  what, at this point we're like, all right,
[04:47.460 --> 04:50.620]  you can change default apps, there you go.
[04:50.620 --> 04:52.800]  It's not like there's a ton of, I mean,
[04:52.800 --> 04:54.540]  I guess if you wanted to be creative
[04:54.540 --> 04:57.100]  you could come up with a whole next set
[04:57.100 --> 05:00.580]  of 10, 20 features to add but it's certainly,
[05:00.580 --> 05:02.640]  you know, and I think people's literacy
[05:02.640 --> 05:06.100]  of learning new features has changed over the years too.
[05:06.100 --> 05:09.700]  People are much more, you know, this is a device
[05:09.700 --> 05:12.400]  that you've now used for a decade all the time
[05:12.400 --> 05:15.060]  so I think people learn new things faster
[05:15.060 --> 05:17.260]  and don't need to be walked through them
[05:17.260 --> 05:20.060]  quite as literally as they may have needed to
[05:20.060 --> 05:21.380]  five or six years ago.
[05:22.900 --> 05:23.720]  Maybe.
[05:25.580 --> 05:29.020]  I, you know, I do think that,
[05:29.020 --> 05:30.860]  I also think that the attention,
[05:30.860 --> 05:33.740]  and I, you know, you can never please everybody, right?
[05:33.740 --> 05:37.380]  I mean, there's 50 different ways of saying that.
[05:37.380 --> 05:42.060]  But I feel like iOS, you know, the iPhone version
[05:42.060 --> 05:44.900]  of iOS in particular changed the least
[05:44.900 --> 05:46.980]  and it's sort of the most additive.
[05:46.980 --> 05:49.580]  Although what they did change is at the very,
[05:49.580 --> 05:50.820]  you know, they even emphasized it.
[05:50.820 --> 05:52.740]  This is the main, you know, your main interface
[05:52.740 --> 05:54.800]  to the phone, the home screen, okay, finally
[05:54.800 --> 05:57.420]  we're gonna put widgets wherever you want them
[05:57.420 --> 05:59.740]  and we're gonna deal with this issue of
[06:01.620 --> 06:05.260]  your fourth and fifth and sixth and seventh page apps
[06:05.260 --> 06:07.520]  just being a complete mess.
[06:08.980 --> 06:10.620]  But I feel like they did it in a good way
[06:10.620 --> 06:15.620]  where it is not, it really should not confuse anybody
[06:15.620 --> 06:18.500]  moving, you know, who's already learned how to use an iPhone.
[06:18.500 --> 06:20.180]  It's, you know, it's not like all of a sudden
[06:20.180 --> 06:22.900]  they're gonna upgrade their iPhone or buy a new one
[06:22.900 --> 06:24.680]  and then they're gonna be lost on the homepage.
[06:24.680 --> 06:26.180]  It's pretty similar.
[06:27.100 --> 06:30.420]  Yeah, it's sort of a power user feature
[06:30.420 --> 06:32.460]  which I know is often an overused term
[06:32.460 --> 06:34.700]  but to me one of the best ways of describing
[06:34.700 --> 06:38.540]  a good power user feature is the sort of thing
[06:38.540 --> 06:42.140]  that's out of the way of normal people.
[06:42.140 --> 06:45.260]  They don't even know it's there but it is there
[06:45.260 --> 06:48.040]  in a very discoverable way for somebody
[06:48.040 --> 06:51.660]  who's enthusiastic enough to dig into it.
[06:51.660 --> 06:54.760]  So you could find it on your own by sort of
[06:54.760 --> 06:58.980]  learning to understand the insert platform here,
[06:58.980 --> 07:02.620]  the Mac way of thinking or the iPhone way of thinking.
[07:02.620 --> 07:04.500]  Well, I would think maybe it would be here.
[07:04.500 --> 07:06.500]  I'll go to the share button and open this sheet
[07:06.500 --> 07:08.940]  and scroll down and oh yeah, here's where you can,
[07:08.940 --> 07:12.300]  you know, do X, Y, or Z.
[07:12.300 --> 07:14.700]  You learn to find features like that
[07:15.700 --> 07:17.460]  and I feel like those home screen features
[07:17.460 --> 07:20.140]  fall into that category where you, you know,
[07:20.140 --> 07:22.100]  I guess it all starts with jiggle mode.
[07:22.100 --> 07:22.940]  Right.
[07:22.940 --> 07:27.940]  I don't, I was so excited that he called it jiggle mode
[07:29.580 --> 07:32.060]  in the keynote and then a bunch of people at Twitter like,
[07:32.060 --> 07:33.300]  they've always called it jiggle mode.
[07:33.300 --> 07:35.940]  It's like, I don't recall anybody in an Apple keynote
[07:35.940 --> 07:37.060]  calling it jiggle mode.
[07:37.060 --> 07:40.340]  It's the kind of joy that we need these days, Jon.
[07:40.340 --> 07:41.860]  Yeah.
[07:41.860 --> 07:42.700]  Yeah.
[07:42.700 --> 07:45.300]  I thought that was the other thing about the keynote
[07:45.300 --> 07:48.140]  that I thought they did a very good job of
[07:48.140 --> 07:52.580]  is they kept it lighthearted and it was sunny, you know,
[07:52.580 --> 07:55.780]  and I, you know, literally sunny in a lot of places
[07:55.780 --> 07:59.100]  where, you know, they clearly filmed in like the atrium
[07:59.100 --> 08:01.880]  of the Steve Jobs Theater with lots of, you know,
[08:01.880 --> 08:03.600]  California sunshine outside.
[08:05.460 --> 08:10.220]  You know, it's difficult times to do a keynote
[08:10.220 --> 08:12.260]  for multiple reasons, you know,
[08:12.260 --> 08:13.900]  and I feel like they hit the right tone.
[08:13.900 --> 08:16.860]  Couple of jokes, not too many, fewer than usual,
[08:18.700 --> 08:21.300]  but I feel like tonally really hit it.
[08:21.300 --> 08:22.740]  You know, like you just, you can't,
[08:22.740 --> 08:24.840]  you certainly can't accuse them of being,
[08:26.820 --> 08:29.980]  pretending that the current situation isn't going on,
[08:29.980 --> 08:33.980]  whether the current situation is the protests, you know,
[08:33.980 --> 08:38.980]  and the Black Lives Matter protests and police stuff
[08:39.140 --> 08:43.500]  around the country or the COVID-19 situation.
[08:44.740 --> 08:46.060]  You know, I think that they acknowledged
[08:46.060 --> 08:46.940]  all of it pretty well.
[08:46.940 --> 08:49.220]  Yeah, and I'm curious like, you know,
[08:49.220 --> 08:52.480]  how far out they kind of rewrote that intro.
[08:53.740 --> 08:56.260]  Yeah, I guess they had several weeks to prepare for it.
[08:56.260 --> 08:58.580]  I thought it was actually really well done
[08:58.580 --> 09:01.080]  in the way that, you know, the first shot
[09:01.080 --> 09:04.020]  was basically a reverse shot of the Steve Jobs stage
[09:04.020 --> 09:05.740]  that you normally would never see
[09:05.740 --> 09:07.920]  except for like a crowd reaction shot
[09:07.920 --> 09:09.660]  showing an empty theater.
[09:09.660 --> 09:13.700]  And there's Tim, you know, kind of washed in backlighting,
[09:14.700 --> 09:17.300]  you know, doing his Tim thing where he kind of rises
[09:17.300 --> 09:20.340]  above just running Apple and acts as a sort
[09:20.340 --> 09:24.180]  of a world leader in a way that, I mean, honestly,
[09:24.180 --> 09:26.060]  like that was probably more substantive
[09:26.060 --> 09:27.940]  than anything our actual leaders have said
[09:27.940 --> 09:29.140]  about either of those things.
[09:29.140 --> 09:31.540]  So I think it was well done.
[09:31.540 --> 09:34.420]  And not too over the top and not too cheesy
[09:34.420 --> 09:38.800]  and not too prolonged, but well done.
[09:38.800 --> 09:39.640]  Yeah.
[09:42.020 --> 09:43.720]  I guess I will take a break.
[09:43.720 --> 09:45.700]  I wanna, you know, I wanna keep moving,
[09:45.700 --> 09:48.020]  but I definitely wanna, when we come back,
[09:48.020 --> 09:49.800]  and I knew you were gonna write about it.
[09:49.800 --> 09:51.020]  I couldn't wait to read it.
[09:51.020 --> 09:53.340]  You wrote about app clips, and I knew,
[09:53.340 --> 09:56.420]  because it's, you know, what was the announcement
[09:56.420 --> 09:59.260]  that was more up the alley of new consumer.
[09:59.260 --> 10:00.100]  Totally.
[10:00.100 --> 10:02.980]  But let's take a break and thank our first sponsor,
[10:02.980 --> 10:07.740]  good friends at Linode, L-I-N-O-D-E, Linode Cloud Hosting.
[10:07.740 --> 10:09.540]  That's where I host Daring Fireball.
[10:09.540 --> 10:11.760]  Oh, man, do I like Linode.
[10:11.760 --> 10:14.240]  When, whether you're working on a personal project
[10:14.240 --> 10:16.760]  or managing your enterprise's infrastructure
[10:16.760 --> 10:20.220]  or something in between, which is probably where I fall,
[10:20.220 --> 10:22.260]  Linode Cloud Hosting has the pricing support
[10:22.260 --> 10:24.260]  and scale you need to take your project
[10:24.260 --> 10:26.380]  to the next level.
[10:26.380 --> 10:28.980]  They have 11 data centers worldwide,
[10:28.980 --> 10:30.500]  enterprise-grade hardware,
[10:30.500 --> 10:33.060]  and their next generation network.
[10:33.060 --> 10:34.940]  It gives you the server performance you expect
[10:34.940 --> 10:37.340]  at a price that you don't.
[10:37.340 --> 10:39.620]  They have a special offer for all talk show listeners
[10:39.620 --> 10:41.700]  and new Linode customers.
[10:41.700 --> 10:43.380]  Use the promo code.
[10:45.620 --> 10:49.300]  The, nope, promo code is talk show 20.
[10:49.300 --> 10:51.560]  I'll explain my confusion in a moment.
[10:51.560 --> 10:55.860]  But you remember that promo code, talk show 20,
[10:55.860 --> 10:58.860]  and you get $20 in free credits.
[10:58.860 --> 11:00.280]  Now, that goes a long way.
[11:00.280 --> 11:02.540]  They have a nanode plan that starts
[11:02.540 --> 11:03.820]  at just five bucks a month,
[11:03.820 --> 11:06.700]  which is a seriously useful plan.
[11:06.700 --> 11:09.420]  20 bucks in credit gets you four months of service.
[11:09.420 --> 11:10.420]  That's unbelievable.
[11:11.300 --> 11:12.740]  You could do all sorts of stuff there.
[11:12.740 --> 11:15.300]  And again, not just work, but I keep hearing,
[11:15.300 --> 11:18.240]  I keep mentioning it, so I keep hearing from readers,
[11:18.240 --> 11:19.780]  so I keep mentioning it.
[11:19.780 --> 11:22.300]  Linode is a great option for game servers,
[11:22.300 --> 11:24.240]  for Minecraft and all sorts of other games
[11:24.240 --> 11:25.780]  where you can run your own servers.
[11:25.780 --> 11:26.780]  And if you're a parent,
[11:26.780 --> 11:30.000]  which I know is a big part of the demo for my audience,
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.680]  what a great way to have your kids run their games
[11:32.680 --> 11:34.300]  and do it in a private way
[11:34.300 --> 11:37.240]  where them and their pals can play these games
[11:37.240 --> 11:41.020]  on their own server at a really, really low monthly cost.
[11:41.020 --> 11:42.860]  And it's really, really easy to set up.
[11:42.860 --> 11:44.640]  They make it easy that it's not like,
[11:44.640 --> 11:46.680]  oh, you can use Linode for this.
[11:46.680 --> 11:49.260]  No, they're totally ready for you to do it.
[11:49.260 --> 11:51.020]  Every technical thing you would want,
[11:51.020 --> 11:54.100]  they've got native SSD storage from the smallest plan
[11:54.100 --> 11:56.380]  to the biggest, 40 gigabit network,
[11:56.380 --> 12:00.240]  industry-leading processors, you name it, they've got it.
[12:00.240 --> 12:02.860]  Just remember that code, talkshow20, when you signed up.
[12:02.860 --> 12:04.320]  You get 20 bucks.
[12:04.320 --> 12:05.680]  Also, they're hiring.
[12:05.680 --> 12:09.180]  So if you're a nerd who might even be vaguely interested
[12:09.180 --> 12:11.520]  in working for a great cloud hosting company,
[12:11.520 --> 12:15.060]  go to linode.com slash careers to find out more.
[12:15.060 --> 12:19.660]  And the URL to go to, linode.com slash the talk show.
[12:19.660 --> 12:23.540]  So the URL, the talk show, linode.com slash the talk show.
[12:23.540 --> 12:28.180]  But the promo code, talkshow20, that's how you save 20 bucks.
[12:28.180 --> 12:29.580]  My thanks to Linode.
[12:30.480 --> 12:34.660]  App Clips, this to me is either, here's what I think,
[12:34.660 --> 12:36.600]  and then I wanna hear more of your thoughts
[12:36.600 --> 12:39.900]  because I thought you had a pretty good take on it.
[12:39.900 --> 12:42.540]  I think this is either gonna be a really big deal
[12:42.540 --> 12:46.860]  or a complete bust and there's not much room in the middle.
[12:46.860 --> 12:49.460]  The sign of any good new technology, right?
[12:50.940 --> 12:51.780]  I think so.
[12:51.780 --> 12:53.780]  That's not a bad rule of thumb
[12:53.780 --> 12:55.440]  that it's either gonna go big or go home.
[12:55.440 --> 12:57.180]  I mean, it's interesting.
[12:57.180 --> 13:00.580]  So I assume everyone here kind of knows what App Clips are,
[13:00.580 --> 13:04.340]  but if not, it's a piece of your iPhone app.
[13:04.340 --> 13:07.980]  So it's not new, I mean, it could be new code,
[13:07.980 --> 13:10.900]  but it's part of your app's binary
[13:10.900 --> 13:14.640]  that is loaded in a completely different way
[13:14.640 --> 13:17.500]  by someone who does not have your app.
[13:17.500 --> 13:21.420]  And they load it by, and it's a bunch of different things.
[13:21.420 --> 13:23.980]  And the examples are basically like,
[13:23.980 --> 13:27.100]  if you're Panera Bread and you have this whole app
[13:27.100 --> 13:28.980]  where you have all your nutrition info
[13:28.980 --> 13:31.700]  and a map that has all your locations
[13:31.700 --> 13:32.940]  and all this kind of stuff,
[13:32.940 --> 13:34.980]  if someone shows up in the store
[13:34.980 --> 13:37.140]  and they see a sign that says,
[13:37.140 --> 13:40.820]  well, we'll get into the QR code in a second,
[13:40.820 --> 13:45.340]  but basically they can load this App Clip
[13:45.340 --> 13:47.820]  that's just the ordering sheet.
[13:47.820 --> 13:50.960]  So, and the whole idea is it has to be under 10 meg,
[13:50.960 --> 13:52.420]  which is actually very small.
[13:52.420 --> 13:56.560]  I mean, I looked at a bunch of the apps, like Starbucks.
[13:56.560 --> 13:59.400]  I think Starbucks is almost 200 megs.
[14:00.900 --> 14:03.340]  Well, you know, these, it's funny,
[14:03.340 --> 14:05.540]  but like these apps do a lot these days.
[14:05.540 --> 14:06.680]  You know, you have your whole-
[14:06.680 --> 14:07.620]  Do you know what though?
[14:07.620 --> 14:08.460]  You know what though?
[14:08.460 --> 14:10.580]  I think a lot of that though is unnecessary bloat.
[14:10.580 --> 14:12.300]  I've seen people analyze it.
[14:12.300 --> 14:14.460]  I think part of it is that they do a lot,
[14:14.460 --> 14:18.080]  but part of it is that modern app development
[14:18.080 --> 14:21.360]  is a lot of, well, we'll just throw a framework in there.
[14:21.360 --> 14:23.060]  And this framework's eight megabytes
[14:23.060 --> 14:25.160]  and this framework's 13 megabytes.
[14:25.160 --> 14:27.160]  And all they're doing is like putting a framework in
[14:27.160 --> 14:28.860]  that does like one little thing.
[14:28.860 --> 14:30.580]  Next thing you know, it's a 200 megabyte app.
[14:30.580 --> 14:32.220]  Yeah, here's the one that tracks you
[14:32.220 --> 14:33.440]  while you're walking around.
[14:33.440 --> 14:34.660]  Here's the one that does, yeah.
[14:34.660 --> 14:35.500]  Right.
[14:35.500 --> 14:40.040]  So essentially, like the whole idea is
[14:40.040 --> 14:42.400]  for an essential part of your app
[14:42.400 --> 14:44.720]  to be able to be almost streamed,
[14:44.720 --> 14:48.100]  cause it's 10 megs, in real time,
[14:48.100 --> 14:51.440]  that solves, that like people can use very quickly
[14:51.440 --> 14:52.920]  to get something done.
[14:52.920 --> 14:55.480]  Whether it's, you know, I'm standing in the lobby
[14:55.480 --> 14:57.840]  of Panera, especially, and this is super helpful
[14:57.840 --> 15:00.520]  during COVID, like you're standing outside of Starbucks.
[15:00.520 --> 15:04.960]  You want to order a coffee for contactless pickup.
[15:04.960 --> 15:07.360]  You don't want to have to download this app,
[15:07.360 --> 15:12.220]  figure out the navigation, sign up for a loyalty account,
[15:12.220 --> 15:16.320]  log in, you know, every time I open like the Grubhub app
[15:16.320 --> 15:18.580]  or whatever, it's like, forget my address.
[15:18.580 --> 15:21.600]  I just want to see the menu of a restaurant.
[15:21.600 --> 15:23.640]  Don't ask me my address, don't, you know,
[15:23.640 --> 15:25.680]  let's skip all the throat clearing
[15:25.680 --> 15:26.740]  and just get into this point
[15:26.740 --> 15:29.680]  where I can just get one thing done very quickly.
[15:29.680 --> 15:33.800]  The sample app that Apple uses in the WWDC sessions
[15:33.800 --> 15:35.380]  is a smoothie ordering app.
[15:35.380 --> 15:38.240]  And you can kind of see where, you know,
[15:38.240 --> 15:40.460]  you're standing in front of the smoothie kiosk.
[15:40.460 --> 15:43.500]  All you want to do is just order a smoothie very quickly
[15:43.500 --> 15:46.640]  and boom, the app clip gets you the ordering screen.
[15:46.640 --> 15:47.480]  That's it.
[15:47.480 --> 15:49.180]  And then of course, you know, this is Apple.
[15:49.180 --> 15:52.060]  So you're encouraged to use Apple Pay.
[15:52.060 --> 15:54.160]  And then, you know, you're encouraged to offer
[15:54.160 --> 15:58.060]  your customers the opportunity to, you know,
[15:58.060 --> 15:59.840]  let people sign up for a loyalty account
[15:59.840 --> 16:02.100]  with sign in with Apple and all these things.
[16:02.100 --> 16:05.820]  But why I wrote about this for the new consumer
[16:05.820 --> 16:08.720]  and the part of it that I think is gonna be
[16:08.720 --> 16:11.320]  either the thing that takes it to that level
[16:11.320 --> 16:13.800]  where it's just part of how we use our phones
[16:13.800 --> 16:16.260]  in the future or not is this thing
[16:16.260 --> 16:18.360]  that's called the app clip code.
[16:18.360 --> 16:21.840]  And it's a round QR code.
[16:21.840 --> 16:23.960]  There's still a lot of details about how it's gonna work
[16:23.960 --> 16:25.280]  that we don't know yet.
[16:25.280 --> 16:29.240]  But the thinking is that there's gonna be this sticker
[16:29.240 --> 16:33.640]  that with this QR code on it that's round
[16:33.640 --> 16:35.860]  that also has an embedded NFC chip.
[16:35.860 --> 16:38.360]  And both of those things, whether you, you know,
[16:38.360 --> 16:42.240]  move your phone close to it or take a photo of the QR code
[16:42.240 --> 16:45.720]  will trigger a URL that is a deep link into your app
[16:45.720 --> 16:47.760]  that not only is to a specific page
[16:47.760 --> 16:49.320]  but could also be associated
[16:49.320 --> 16:52.120]  with a specific geographic location.
[16:52.120 --> 16:54.120]  And in fact, your app can actually ping the server
[16:54.120 --> 16:56.720]  and confirm that you're actually in the location
[16:56.720 --> 16:58.700]  that the sticker is supposed to be in.
[16:58.700 --> 17:00.860]  So that helps if you're, again,
[17:00.860 --> 17:03.260]  to go back to our Starbucks analogy.
[17:03.260 --> 17:04.980]  It not only knows that you wanna go straight
[17:04.980 --> 17:08.180]  to the order screen, but it knows what exact location
[17:08.180 --> 17:09.220]  you should be ordering from.
[17:09.220 --> 17:11.000]  So you don't have to go through the process
[17:11.000 --> 17:13.820]  of looking at the map, trying to figure out
[17:13.820 --> 17:17.400]  which of the four Starbucks in your immediate vicinity
[17:17.400 --> 17:19.840]  is the one you're standing in front of.
[17:19.840 --> 17:23.600]  And this extends to, you know,
[17:23.600 --> 17:26.500]  another example they gave is a scooter rental service.
[17:26.500 --> 17:29.720]  You know, if you have 10,000 scooters in your fleet,
[17:29.720 --> 17:31.780]  each code will be different and each code
[17:31.780 --> 17:35.800]  will actually be delineated to that specific scooter.
[17:35.800 --> 17:39.780]  So boom, it'll check, okay, is this scooter in our network
[17:39.780 --> 17:41.680]  where we think it's supposed to be?
[17:41.680 --> 17:44.800]  Start riding, you know, pay for it,
[17:44.800 --> 17:46.440]  deal with all the other nonsense later.
[17:46.440 --> 17:50.120]  So it's an interesting, it's an interesting idea.
[17:50.120 --> 17:53.000]  You know, we're in this era where a lot of companies
[17:53.000 --> 17:55.460]  have iPhone apps that do a lot of different things.
[17:55.460 --> 17:57.960]  They keep taking advantage of all these new technologies
[17:57.960 --> 17:59.720]  in the phone, but if you just wanna get
[17:59.720 --> 18:02.360]  one simple thing done, pay for parking,
[18:02.360 --> 18:06.600]  order something, you know, make a purchase,
[18:06.600 --> 18:08.080]  I think it could be a really interesting
[18:08.080 --> 18:11.720]  and compelling use for gaming and art, maybe.
[18:11.720 --> 18:13.280]  I don't know if that's gonna be allowed,
[18:13.280 --> 18:16.840]  but it seems very much purposely designed
[18:16.840 --> 18:19.700]  to just get one thing done very quickly,
[18:20.540 --> 18:24.720]  which, you know, well, there's a whole other
[18:24.720 --> 18:25.920]  set of things we can talk about.
[18:25.920 --> 18:27.440]  But yeah, that's the overview.
[18:28.980 --> 18:31.640]  I think that a couple of the interesting parts,
[18:31.640 --> 18:33.880]  another way to think of it is just sort of
[18:33.880 --> 18:36.320]  a mini version of the app, right?
[18:36.320 --> 18:40.800]  Like, there's not, and it's a little hard to,
[18:40.800 --> 18:42.720]  I always feel like the best way to learn anything
[18:42.720 --> 18:45.720]  is to just start using it, and you can't quite do it yet
[18:45.720 --> 18:48.200]  because nobody has app clips out yet,
[18:48.200 --> 18:50.000]  and you can't just say, you know, like,
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.720]  oh, they've already worked with Starbucks,
[18:52.720 --> 18:56.200]  and if you run the iOS 14 beta,
[18:56.200 --> 18:58.720]  you can already get the Starbucks app clip,
[18:58.720 --> 18:59.880]  you know, it doesn't work like that,
[18:59.880 --> 19:01.560]  so you kinda have to go by the sessions.
[19:01.560 --> 19:04.680]  But it's really just a mini version of the app,
[19:04.680 --> 19:07.920]  and part of it shows my age as somebody
[19:07.920 --> 19:10.600]  who came of age, you know, in the 90s,
[19:10.600 --> 19:13.560]  building websites, you know, when we tried to,
[19:13.560 --> 19:17.000]  we measured websites by the kilobyte, you know?
[19:17.000 --> 19:18.100]  And it mattered, right?
[19:18.100 --> 19:20.560]  It was like, that was like, it wasn't just a sign
[19:20.560 --> 19:22.880]  of professional pride and perfectionism,
[19:22.880 --> 19:25.700]  it was like, when I was doing freelance web development
[19:25.700 --> 19:29.560]  in like the mid to late 90s and early 2000s,
[19:29.560 --> 19:31.500]  it's like being able to tell people
[19:31.500 --> 19:34.280]  you'd have a faster website, and it would actually load
[19:34.280 --> 19:36.880]  pretty, you know, as quick as you can imagine
[19:36.880 --> 19:39.280]  on a modem connection, it mattered.
[19:39.280 --> 19:42.460]  And so talking about 10 megabytes as a small payload
[19:42.460 --> 19:44.560]  still sounds to me like a lot.
[19:44.560 --> 19:47.360]  I think my whole left TV account was two megs, so.
[19:47.360 --> 19:52.360]  But on the other hand, like you pointed out,
[19:52.360 --> 19:55.140]  and you know, a lot of very popular apps
[19:55.140 --> 19:59.140]  that are also the very much, the type of apps
[19:59.140 --> 20:02.520]  that ought to be using the app clips feature
[20:02.520 --> 20:05.840]  have, you know, 180 megabytes, 200 megabytes
[20:05.840 --> 20:07.280]  just to get the app.
[20:07.280 --> 20:08.880]  And then the bigger difference too,
[20:08.880 --> 20:11.640]  in addition to a lot less to download,
[20:11.640 --> 20:14.780]  so it's there installed and running, you know,
[20:14.780 --> 20:18.740]  one-tenth the size, you know, easily, maybe more,
[20:18.740 --> 20:20.960]  is the first run experience, right?
[20:20.960 --> 20:24.280]  The idea is that if you get the app for ordering
[20:24.280 --> 20:27.040]  from the, you know, Slurpee place,
[20:27.040 --> 20:29.280]  or what'd you say the example was?
[20:29.280 --> 20:31.160]  Not Slurpees, what's the?
[20:31.160 --> 20:33.760]  Smoothies, that's what we call Slurpees nowadays.
[20:35.400 --> 20:38.600]  But you know, if the idea is you get the app clip
[20:38.600 --> 20:41.000]  and then you can pre-order your thing,
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.600]  it's not gonna sit there and ask you for an email
[20:43.600 --> 20:46.480]  and a password and all this nonsense, you know,
[20:46.480 --> 20:49.160]  and go check your email for the confirmation code
[20:49.160 --> 20:52.240]  and tap the thing and oh, go fish it out of your spam
[20:52.240 --> 20:53.620]  because it actually went to spam
[20:53.620 --> 20:56.680]  and then click the link in there and now you're registered.
[20:56.680 --> 20:59.600]  By that time, you know, you've already missed your turn
[20:59.600 --> 21:01.400]  to get your smoothie.
[21:01.400 --> 21:05.160]  So you know, have it just launch, show me the things
[21:05.160 --> 21:08.100]  and then you tap it and it already knows you're there
[21:08.100 --> 21:09.800]  because you got it, like you said,
[21:09.800 --> 21:11.880]  and you know, hopefully it removes a lot of it.
[21:11.880 --> 21:15.640]  And I feel like what they're competing with in some ways
[21:16.800 --> 21:19.800]  is the obvious thing they're competing with
[21:19.800 --> 21:22.160]  is just downloading the whole app
[21:22.160 --> 21:25.800]  and going through the normal first run experience
[21:25.800 --> 21:28.240]  and the permissions and et cetera, et cetera.
[21:28.240 --> 21:30.820]  But the other thing they're competing against
[21:30.820 --> 21:34.160]  is just the good old fashioned real world, right?
[21:34.160 --> 21:38.000]  Like how many places have you been in your life,
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.560]  you know, for decades where if you're a regular,
[21:40.560 --> 21:42.160]  you get a little business card
[21:42.160 --> 21:43.860]  that's like every 10 times you come in,
[21:43.860 --> 21:46.400]  they stamp it and then you get like a free sandwich
[21:46.400 --> 21:48.040]  or something like that.
[21:48.040 --> 21:50.400]  And that's all the card does.
[21:50.400 --> 21:52.680]  Everybody understands what it does.
[21:52.680 --> 21:53.800]  They give you the card, they're like,
[21:53.800 --> 21:54.660]  hey, would you like this?
[21:54.660 --> 21:56.020]  And you know, here, I'll stamp it
[21:56.020 --> 22:00.160]  and then buy nine more sandwiches and you get a free one.
[22:00.160 --> 22:04.640]  Everybody understands what that card is, how it works
[22:04.640 --> 22:06.680]  and you can make the personal choice
[22:06.680 --> 22:08.940]  as to whether it's actually something
[22:08.940 --> 22:10.240]  you wanna stick in your wallet
[22:10.240 --> 22:12.360]  and you'll use, which a lot of people do,
[22:12.360 --> 22:14.280]  or if you'll just politely, you know,
[22:14.280 --> 22:16.740]  wait till you're out of sight and throw it away.
[22:18.300 --> 22:19.720]  But it's easy, you understand it.
[22:19.720 --> 22:22.160]  Nobody's confused by that card, right?
[22:22.160 --> 22:24.380]  And so like the idea with an app clip
[22:24.380 --> 22:26.520]  is if you just point your phone,
[22:26.520 --> 22:31.440]  you know, no matter how easy they make these app clip codes.
[22:31.440 --> 22:33.080]  And I do think they look pretty easy
[22:33.080 --> 22:36.040]  and I think the NFC stuff certainly helps make it easier
[22:36.040 --> 22:38.020]  where you just kind of get your phone close to it
[22:38.020 --> 22:39.220]  and it should pop up with,
[22:39.220 --> 22:43.040]  do you wanna load the app clip for Dan's Smoothie Shop?
[22:43.040 --> 22:45.400]  And then, yeah, that's exactly why I'm waving my phone
[22:45.400 --> 22:47.600]  at this tap a button and then you've got it.
[22:48.800 --> 22:51.640]  You know, and you know, seven to eight,
[22:51.640 --> 22:55.240]  nine megabyte download over a typical LTE network
[22:55.240 --> 22:57.520]  is actually going to happen pretty fast.
[22:57.520 --> 22:58.440]  There you are.
[22:58.440 --> 23:01.480]  You know, it's pretty close to the seamlessness
[23:01.480 --> 23:03.680]  of just picking up a flyer, right?
[23:03.680 --> 23:06.920]  Or a lot of busy takeout places will have, you know,
[23:06.920 --> 23:09.440]  obviously a lot of places have a menu on the wall
[23:09.440 --> 23:11.080]  that you can look at, but you know,
[23:11.080 --> 23:13.200]  they'll give you back in pre-COVID days,
[23:13.200 --> 23:16.440]  like a laminated menu to look at while you're in line
[23:16.440 --> 23:17.400]  or something like that.
[23:17.400 --> 23:18.240]  Totally.
[23:18.240 --> 23:21.040]  And let's not forget, like it's actually very easy
[23:21.040 --> 23:24.080]  to just stand there and order a smoothie off the menu.
[23:24.080 --> 23:26.440]  It's not, that's not a hardship,
[23:26.440 --> 23:29.400]  but that is assuming that, you know,
[23:29.400 --> 23:31.400]  there is a person there to take the order
[23:31.400 --> 23:34.400]  and that's assuming that you're actually standing there.
[23:34.400 --> 23:36.840]  And one of the interesting things about app clips
[23:36.840 --> 23:41.060]  is that not only are they discoverable in that setting,
[23:41.060 --> 23:42.280]  you know, the physical setting,
[23:42.280 --> 23:44.320]  but they're also going to be deep linked
[23:44.320 --> 23:47.760]  from the Apple maps listing for a location.
[23:47.760 --> 23:48.600]  They're shareable.
[23:48.600 --> 23:51.180]  You can text message someone a link to it.
[23:51.180 --> 23:54.700]  So it's a little more elaborate than just, you know,
[23:54.700 --> 23:57.680]  scan this QR code and load this thing.
[23:57.680 --> 24:00.960]  I think a good analogy is it's kind of like a webpage
[24:00.960 --> 24:02.000]  versus a website.
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.840]  And I think, you know, we talk about this mini app thing.
[24:04.840 --> 24:09.840]  To me, you know, and we'll see how it works in practice.
[24:10.440 --> 24:12.440]  My guess is that there's going to be a lot of things
[24:12.440 --> 24:16.640]  that the kind of ideal demo suggests
[24:16.640 --> 24:17.720]  that it would be useful for,
[24:17.720 --> 24:19.840]  where it turns out that it's just not that useful.
[24:19.840 --> 24:21.440]  And then there's going to be a bunch of new stuff,
[24:21.440 --> 24:23.480]  you know, whether it's vending machines
[24:23.480 --> 24:27.040]  or new types of retail designs, you know,
[24:27.040 --> 24:29.660]  this whole COVID period where you really are trying
[24:29.660 --> 24:31.960]  to minimize contact with staff.
[24:31.960 --> 24:36.200]  And a lot of places are not passing out menus at all,
[24:36.200 --> 24:39.180]  where it could actually be very useful and reduce friction.
[24:39.180 --> 24:43.380]  And, you know, a lot of times people are not only reluctant
[24:43.380 --> 24:45.120]  to download an app, but they'll download it
[24:45.120 --> 24:46.020]  and then never use it.
[24:46.020 --> 24:48.380]  I mean, I probably have three pages of apps on my phone
[24:48.380 --> 24:49.520]  that I've never even used.
[24:49.520 --> 24:54.520]  So if you can get someone to not only stop
[24:54.560 --> 24:57.660]  and see that something is available for purchase,
[24:57.660 --> 25:00.600]  but get the page to order it and order it
[25:00.600 --> 25:04.560]  and place the order within seconds instead of minutes
[25:04.560 --> 25:08.840]  or whatever it is, it could be very useful.
[25:08.840 --> 25:10.860]  But again, we'll see, I don't know.
[25:12.080 --> 25:12.920]  Maybe not.
[25:13.920 --> 25:15.720]  The other one that everybody keeps mentioning,
[25:15.720 --> 25:17.760]  and I think it's maybe a better example
[25:17.760 --> 25:21.480]  of something app clips can do that the real world can't,
[25:21.480 --> 25:24.000]  are the parking apps.
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.640]  And so like, I think part of the idea is, you know,
[25:26.640 --> 25:29.560]  like a municipality can have a certain app
[25:29.560 --> 25:32.680]  and you get the app clip and instead of pumping quarters
[25:32.680 --> 25:35.280]  into a meter, you just use the app.
[25:37.200 --> 25:40.000]  And part of the, it's like, oh, well, quarters.
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.280]  Everybody understood quarters and the inconvenience
[25:42.280 --> 25:45.080]  was if you had the quarters, you were set.
[25:45.080 --> 25:47.760]  And if you didn't, you're screwed.
[25:47.760 --> 25:50.600]  And that did suck if you were out of quarters.
[25:50.600 --> 25:52.960]  And I think we've all been in that situation.
[25:55.420 --> 25:57.560]  And, you know, and then you learn to just hide
[25:57.560 --> 25:59.520]  a roll of quarters somewhere in your car
[25:59.520 --> 26:00.980]  and they're always there.
[26:02.800 --> 26:05.440]  But the thing that an app can do is an app can do things
[26:05.440 --> 26:10.120]  like, hey, you know, I know you put in exactly 90 minutes
[26:10.120 --> 26:14.560]  of time and at 80 minutes, I can send you an alert
[26:14.560 --> 26:17.600]  and you're still at your kid's school play
[26:17.600 --> 26:19.600]  or something like that and you get an alert that says,
[26:19.600 --> 26:22.000]  hey, you know, your meter's up in 10 minutes.
[26:22.000 --> 26:23.880]  Do you wanna put more time in?
[26:23.880 --> 26:25.560]  And then maybe you can just put the more time in
[26:25.560 --> 26:28.040]  right there, you know, punch it into the phone
[26:28.040 --> 26:30.600]  instead of being the jerk who has to get up
[26:30.600 --> 26:33.960]  from the kindergarten sing-along and run out
[26:33.960 --> 26:35.640]  and pump quarters into a meter.
[26:35.640 --> 26:36.760]  That's pretty cool, right?
[26:36.760 --> 26:38.680]  Then you feel like you're living in the future
[26:38.680 --> 26:41.200]  and it's like, hey, that was pretty cool.
[26:41.200 --> 26:44.420]  And you also feel like, hey, I don't have to like,
[26:45.480 --> 26:47.000]  I don't know how long this dentist appointment's
[26:47.000 --> 26:50.360]  gonna take, I better just put $4 a quarters in here.
[26:50.360 --> 26:52.160]  You know, you don't know.
[26:52.160 --> 26:54.280]  It's, you know, so I could see it.
[26:54.280 --> 26:56.360]  So a few other things that I think are really interesting
[26:56.360 --> 26:59.280]  about the implementation is that to that point,
[26:59.280 --> 27:03.480]  that notification, the whole idea, again,
[27:03.480 --> 27:04.480]  is to lower friction.
[27:04.480 --> 27:06.160]  So it's actually not gonna prompt you
[27:06.160 --> 27:08.080]  to see if you want that notification or not.
[27:08.080 --> 27:09.900]  It's not gonna ask you for permission
[27:09.900 --> 27:12.640]  to send you notifications for, I think, eight hours
[27:13.640 --> 27:17.940]  or also location information for that first query,
[27:17.940 --> 27:20.240]  that first confirmation that you're in the place
[27:20.240 --> 27:21.120]  that it thinks you are.
[27:21.120 --> 27:24.940]  So it's a much less, the onboarding process
[27:24.940 --> 27:27.840]  is a lot less kind of hairy.
[27:27.840 --> 27:32.240]  Another interesting thing is that because it's part of,
[27:32.240 --> 27:34.720]  because the app clip is part of the main binary
[27:34.720 --> 27:39.720]  of your app, there's this thing like this shared data pool,
[27:40.520 --> 27:45.160]  I guess you could call it, where if you download
[27:45.160 --> 27:48.400]  the full app after you use the app clip,
[27:48.400 --> 27:51.400]  it will move your information over into the main app.
[27:51.400 --> 27:54.240]  So you don't have to sign up for an account a second time
[27:54.240 --> 27:56.960]  or anything like that, which I think is pretty slick.
[27:56.960 --> 27:59.260]  Then there's this idea that these app clips
[27:59.260 --> 28:03.080]  are almost ephemeral in a way.
[28:03.080 --> 28:05.460]  Like if you don't use them, if you only use them once,
[28:05.460 --> 28:09.360]  if you're visiting a new city and you get five app clips
[28:09.360 --> 28:11.740]  because you're at restaurants that you don't go to
[28:11.740 --> 28:15.800]  in your main city and you never use them,
[28:15.800 --> 28:19.320]  Apple will actually just clear them off your phone for you,
[28:19.320 --> 28:20.200]  which is kind of interesting.
[28:20.200 --> 28:25.200]  If you do use them over and over, it will keep them.
[28:25.200 --> 28:30.200]  And then lastly, this idea that an app can have
[28:30.760 --> 28:32.840]  multiple app clips that are active on your phone
[28:32.840 --> 28:33.680]  at the same time.
[28:33.680 --> 28:37.360]  So imagine Yelp could make an app clip for,
[28:37.360 --> 28:39.680]  if it wanted to, every business in its directory
[28:39.680 --> 28:43.240]  that's this kind of discrete branded app clip
[28:43.240 --> 28:45.060]  and you could have seven different app clips
[28:45.060 --> 28:46.700]  from the Yelp app on your phone,
[28:46.700 --> 28:49.400]  each of those for different locations.
[28:49.400 --> 28:51.840]  I imagine at that point you're just gonna get the Yelp app,
[28:51.840 --> 28:56.560]  but you start to see how, and I was just on,
[28:56.560 --> 28:58.960]  not to plug another podcast, but I was talking about this
[28:58.960 --> 29:02.360]  with one of the partners from Andreessen Horowitz
[29:02.360 --> 29:04.960]  on one of their podcasts this week,
[29:04.960 --> 29:06.960]  who studies the China market a lot.
[29:06.960 --> 29:10.160]  And this kind of pushes us towards this era
[29:10.160 --> 29:12.720]  that has not really happened in the US of these super apps
[29:12.720 --> 29:17.720]  where a lot of the activity is not every restaurant
[29:17.720 --> 29:19.840]  making their own app or every chain making their own app,
[29:19.840 --> 29:23.960]  but having a place within a WeChat or a bigger ecosystem.
[29:23.960 --> 29:28.160]  So a lot to kind of sketch out where maybe this is gonna
[29:28.160 --> 29:30.360]  happen over the next 10 years, maybe not,
[29:30.360 --> 29:34.220]  but it is kind of a really interesting new point where,
[29:34.220 --> 29:37.320]  and I guess this exists in other app platforms
[29:37.320 --> 29:40.540]  like Snapchat has its own version of this,
[29:40.540 --> 29:43.340]  I think Android does too, but it's an interesting thing
[29:43.340 --> 29:45.460]  from an iOS perspective as well.
[29:45.460 --> 29:49.340]  It feels to me like the Android version.
[29:49.340 --> 29:53.460]  I forget what they call it, but it doesn't seem like
[29:53.460 --> 29:54.900]  that ever really took off.
[29:54.900 --> 29:59.500]  I mean, and that's sort of the, it's a bust possible future
[29:59.500 --> 30:00.740]  for app clips that I see.
[30:00.740 --> 30:03.620]  Like I never hear anybody talking about,
[30:03.620 --> 30:07.680]  oh, I was somewhere and I got the Android card
[30:07.680 --> 30:10.020]  or whatever they call the little clips.
[30:10.020 --> 30:13.660]  I've never heard anybody talk about using such a thing.
[30:13.660 --> 30:15.820]  Certainly don't hear about it, yeah.
[30:15.820 --> 30:19.500]  But Apple has a very successful track record
[30:19.500 --> 30:22.040]  at getting people to do stuff that no one else
[30:22.040 --> 30:22.940]  can get them to do.
[30:22.940 --> 30:24.700]  So I don't know, we'll see.
[30:24.700 --> 30:27.360]  I think it's neat, I don't know if I'm gonna use them.
[30:27.360 --> 30:29.380]  I mean, I guess I will to test them out
[30:29.380 --> 30:30.940]  if I see them out and around.
[30:30.940 --> 30:33.980]  I'm very interested in how these stickers are gonna happen.
[30:33.980 --> 30:37.740]  I asked Apple and they're not talking about it yet,
[30:37.740 --> 30:41.540]  but and they kind of say in some of the session videos,
[30:41.540 --> 30:43.720]  like, you know, we're gonna make tools
[30:43.720 --> 30:46.500]  that help you make these stickers.
[30:46.500 --> 30:48.820]  I don't know if they're gonna approve stickers.
[30:48.820 --> 30:50.580]  Are they gonna make you guarantee
[30:50.580 --> 30:53.180]  that you're not gonna vandalize public places
[30:53.180 --> 30:54.020]  with these stickers?
[30:54.020 --> 30:57.020]  I think there's a lot of unknowns to those stickers
[30:57.020 --> 30:59.240]  that we'll have to find out, but.
[31:00.260 --> 31:01.900]  Well, I didn't even think about that angle,
[31:01.900 --> 31:03.500]  but there is, that is an angle
[31:03.500 --> 31:05.500]  because it is sort of clearly the,
[31:05.500 --> 31:07.800]  I don't think there's an Apple logo on it,
[31:07.800 --> 31:11.480]  but it's very clearly an iPhone in the center
[31:11.480 --> 31:12.820]  of the thing.
[31:12.820 --> 31:14.480]  They sort of look like a fingerprint,
[31:14.480 --> 31:15.980]  like the Touch ID fingerprint.
[31:15.980 --> 31:18.300]  They're like a, combined with,
[31:19.680 --> 31:23.680]  people are saying the Maze from Westworld
[31:25.980 --> 31:30.980]  and also the Hatch logos from Lost.
[31:32.840 --> 31:34.580]  But it's, you know, it's sort of like
[31:34.580 --> 31:38.480]  a circular fingerprint type thing with, you know,
[31:38.480 --> 31:40.920]  and yeah, I don't know how to read it or decipher it,
[31:40.920 --> 31:45.140]  but you can see that there's sort of a Morse code-y pattern
[31:45.140 --> 31:47.620]  to the concentric rings, you know.
[31:47.620 --> 31:51.460]  Short, long dashes as the rings go around.
[31:51.460 --> 31:55.180]  So you don't have to be a cryptographer
[31:55.180 --> 31:57.380]  to try to figure out how to actually read it
[31:57.380 --> 31:58.300]  and figure out what it is,
[31:58.300 --> 32:00.860]  but you can see that it's an embedded code.
[32:00.860 --> 32:02.820]  Same way that you can look at a QR code
[32:02.820 --> 32:05.500]  and see that there's this black and white pattern.
[32:06.460 --> 32:08.100]  But I guess it sort of raises the pattern.
[32:08.100 --> 32:11.540]  The question, why don't they just use QR codes?
[32:11.540 --> 32:14.780]  And I think I know the answer to that,
[32:15.900 --> 32:18.300]  which is, well, there's two answers.
[32:18.300 --> 32:21.140]  One, my first, the one that made me laugh,
[32:21.140 --> 32:23.560]  is that QR codes are so freaking ugly.
[32:23.560 --> 32:24.400]  They're just ugly.
[32:24.400 --> 32:27.100]  They're horrible, they're so super ugly,
[32:27.100 --> 32:30.380]  and I think Apple resisted using them for so long,
[32:30.380 --> 32:34.020]  and then I forget when, but like a year or two ago,
[32:34.020 --> 32:36.220]  maybe three years ago, they did build in a feature
[32:36.220 --> 32:38.380]  to the iOS camera, where if you just open up
[32:38.380 --> 32:40.940]  your camera app and point it at a QR code,
[32:40.940 --> 32:43.540]  it will recognize it and then say like,
[32:43.540 --> 32:46.280]  oh, okay, do you wanna open the Starbucks app
[32:46.280 --> 32:48.760]  or whatever the QR code is for?
[32:48.760 --> 32:51.240]  Write in the camera app, because prior to that,
[32:51.240 --> 32:55.180]  you had to go to the app store and get a QR code reader.
[32:56.260 --> 32:58.600]  And it was like a whole cottage industry of,
[32:58.600 --> 33:00.420]  I mean, literally, I'm not even exaggerating.
[33:00.420 --> 33:01.260]  Hundreds.
[33:01.260 --> 33:03.860]  Maybe hundreds, hundreds of apps,
[33:03.860 --> 33:08.860]  because Apple didn't, chose not to build it into the system,
[33:09.400 --> 33:10.940]  it was an obvious need.
[33:10.940 --> 33:13.500]  Their QR codes are all over the world,
[33:13.500 --> 33:17.340]  and so it, in one sense, it's like,
[33:17.340 --> 33:18.740]  well, the app store works.
[33:18.740 --> 33:20.940]  You could just go to the app store and get it,
[33:20.940 --> 33:22.380]  but which one do you get?
[33:22.380 --> 33:24.340]  And they're all just, every single one
[33:24.340 --> 33:27.660]  just was some variation of any obvious name
[33:27.660 --> 33:32.660]  you could think of, QR code scanner, QR code reader,
[33:32.660 --> 33:36.020]  reader for QR codes, you just name it.
[33:36.020 --> 33:37.300]  There was an app for it.
[33:37.300 --> 33:38.520]  They all looked the same.
[33:38.520 --> 33:40.220]  They all had cheeseball icons.
[33:40.220 --> 33:43.300]  They all were from developers you've never heard of.
[33:43.300 --> 33:44.620]  And what do you do?
[33:44.620 --> 33:45.460]  I don't know.
[33:46.400 --> 33:48.220]  So I'm glad they built it into the camera app
[33:48.220 --> 33:49.500]  so you don't have to worry about it,
[33:49.500 --> 33:51.760]  but I can see why Apple's not using it.
[33:51.760 --> 33:53.500]  QR codes, they are so ugly.
[33:53.500 --> 33:55.300]  And then the second idea is,
[33:55.300 --> 33:58.420]  QR codes are cross-platform and work for everybody.
[33:58.420 --> 34:01.780]  And I think they always just transform into a URL
[34:01.780 --> 34:04.900]  and I think that by doing their own scheme,
[34:04.900 --> 34:06.380]  they have a lot more control over it.
[34:06.380 --> 34:08.980]  They can build something proprietary
[34:08.980 --> 34:10.380]  that's just for iPhones.
[34:10.380 --> 34:15.140]  And it can, I don't know what the actual decoded
[34:16.340 --> 34:18.360]  app clip code resolves to.
[34:18.360 --> 34:22.420]  Maybe it is just, but I don't know if there's anything else
[34:22.420 --> 34:23.980]  in addition to the URL.
[34:23.980 --> 34:28.980]  Presumably, it's something that points to apps.apple.com
[34:28.980 --> 34:32.680]  or whatever the new URL, the top-level domain is
[34:32.680 --> 34:33.620]  for the App Store.
[34:34.960 --> 34:37.000]  So presumably, there's a URL in there,
[34:37.000 --> 34:38.920]  but I don't know if there's anything else.
[34:38.920 --> 34:41.440]  Some of this is in the videos, but I don't remember.
[34:41.440 --> 34:44.920]  But I don't know what the code goes to.
[34:44.920 --> 34:47.500]  And if it's, could Google hijack that then
[34:47.500 --> 34:49.040]  in a future version of Android
[34:49.040 --> 34:53.000]  and translate that to a deep link into Android apps?
[34:53.000 --> 34:53.840]  I don't know.
[34:54.680 --> 34:55.920]  All right, I don't know either.
[34:55.920 --> 34:58.640]  And it raises the question to,
[34:58.640 --> 35:01.760]  however popular the iPhone is in the United States,
[35:01.760 --> 35:04.200]  it certainly varies by countries around the world.
[35:04.200 --> 35:09.200]  And does a business want to have two different things?
[35:09.720 --> 35:14.220]  One of the nice advantages of most payment systems
[35:14.220 --> 35:17.960]  that take Apple Pay is that they also are,
[35:17.960 --> 35:19.840]  they're not tied specifically,
[35:19.840 --> 35:22.100]  it's not like an Apple-branded reader
[35:22.100 --> 35:26.640]  that only takes iPhones for Apple Pay or Apple Watch.
[35:26.640 --> 35:29.600]  It is an NFC payment thing
[35:29.600 --> 35:32.840]  that also can take Android phone payment.
[35:32.840 --> 35:35.640]  So that's good for the business.
[35:35.640 --> 35:39.040]  I think it's good not to have that locked into one platform.
[35:39.040 --> 35:40.440]  Well, and then imagine this world
[35:40.440 --> 35:42.360]  where you walk into a restaurant
[35:42.360 --> 35:46.080]  and they have the Grubhub app code,
[35:46.080 --> 35:48.080]  they have the TripAdvisor app code,
[35:48.080 --> 35:51.080]  they have the Resi and the OpenTable.
[35:51.080 --> 35:53.400]  It's like, which of these do I wanna use?
[35:53.400 --> 35:54.380]  I don't even know.
[35:54.380 --> 35:57.200]  Right, and then it's just another variation
[35:57.200 --> 36:00.040]  of the 300 different QR code reader apps in the App Store.
[36:00.040 --> 36:00.880]  It's like, what do I do?
[36:00.880 --> 36:01.840]  I don't know what to do.
[36:01.840 --> 36:04.720]  You know, right, you kind of want that clarity.
[36:04.720 --> 36:08.120]  I mean, it should not be hard to get a smoothie.
[36:08.120 --> 36:10.920]  Yeah, I keep wanting to say Slurpee.
[36:10.920 --> 36:13.820]  I mean, it shouldn't be hard to get a Slurpee either.
[36:16.240 --> 36:20.240]  But whatever cold, refreshing treat you want to order,
[36:20.240 --> 36:21.540]  it shouldn't be complicated
[36:21.540 --> 36:24.160]  and you shouldn't have to learn what to get.
[36:24.160 --> 36:26.540]  And then you mentioned it in New Consumer, too,
[36:26.540 --> 36:29.040]  is on the other end,
[36:29.040 --> 36:31.560]  in addition to the proliferation of choices
[36:31.560 --> 36:32.760]  and trying to reduce that
[36:32.760 --> 36:34.600]  from the business and the consumer side,
[36:34.600 --> 36:36.280]  how do you avoid the scams?
[36:36.280 --> 36:39.880]  How do you keep a company from making an app clip
[36:39.880 --> 36:44.300]  for Dan's smoothie shop that you don't even know about,
[36:44.300 --> 36:46.240]  which we've learned is actually a problem
[36:46.240 --> 36:51.240]  with a lot of the food delivery places, like a huge problem.
[36:51.280 --> 36:53.300]  There's a place here, I was telling a friend,
[36:53.300 --> 36:55.920]  there's a place here in Philly.
[36:55.920 --> 36:58.200]  It's been here, I don't know, 30 years,
[36:58.200 --> 37:02.140]  Pete's Famous Pizza, and they do their own delivery.
[37:03.140 --> 37:06.040]  And it's one of these places, it's a pizza place.
[37:06.040 --> 37:09.140]  They have two locations vaguely in Center City, Philly.
[37:10.200 --> 37:11.960]  You know, they're strategically located
[37:11.960 --> 37:14.440]  to cover the maximum area.
[37:14.440 --> 37:16.720]  They have their own trucks and cars.
[37:16.720 --> 37:18.200]  You know, you see them riding around.
[37:18.200 --> 37:20.280]  It's not even just like a magnet that somebody puts on.
[37:20.280 --> 37:21.460]  Like, they own their cars.
[37:21.460 --> 37:24.120]  You know, you see Pete's Famous Pizza driving around.
[37:25.060 --> 37:28.080]  And, you know, one of the, I forget who it was,
[37:28.080 --> 37:30.560]  Grubhub, or if it's not Grubhub,
[37:30.560 --> 37:32.520]  I apologize to those of you who work at Grubhub.
[37:32.520 --> 37:35.860]  But one of those type of places had like a scam website
[37:35.860 --> 37:39.000]  instead of like, and Pete's has their own website, you know.
[37:39.000 --> 37:42.360]  But it was like, if you Google Pete's Famous Pizza Philly,
[37:42.360 --> 37:45.040]  you'd get like, there's like an alternate URL
[37:45.040 --> 37:46.080]  and it looks legit.
[37:46.080 --> 37:48.760]  It's like Pete's Famous Pizza in Philly.
[37:48.760 --> 37:52.000]  And if you order from there, you're getting a Pete's Famous
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.680]  Pizza, but they're the ones going to get it, you know,
[37:54.680 --> 37:55.980]  even though Pete's has delivery.
[37:55.980 --> 37:57.460]  It's crazy.
[37:57.460 --> 37:58.580]  It's like a total scam.
[37:58.580 --> 38:00.160]  Yeah, so.
[38:00.160 --> 38:01.920]  And so, how do you keep that, how do you keep that
[38:01.920 --> 38:05.080]  sort of mindset from creeping into this app clip thing?
[38:05.080 --> 38:07.280]  Presumably, Apple's thinking about that
[38:07.280 --> 38:09.200]  because that seems right up the alley
[38:09.200 --> 38:11.080]  of all the privacy-focused stuff
[38:11.080 --> 38:13.880]  they've been working on across the board.
[38:13.880 --> 38:15.420]  Right, and that's where I don't know, like,
[38:15.420 --> 38:18.560]  will it just be a best practice?
[38:18.560 --> 38:21.520]  Will they advise you not to create app clips
[38:21.520 --> 38:23.440]  for businesses that don't want them,
[38:23.440 --> 38:26.380]  or will they actually enforce it somehow?
[38:26.380 --> 38:27.220]  I don't know.
[38:27.220 --> 38:28.280]  It's gonna be interesting though, you know,
[38:28.280 --> 38:30.440]  are we gonna start seeing app clips in ads,
[38:30.440 --> 38:32.760]  or on posters, or?
[38:32.760 --> 38:34.080]  Yeah.
[38:34.080 --> 38:35.560]  Yeah, and what's the right to print them?
[38:35.560 --> 38:37.380]  Because part of making them look better,
[38:37.380 --> 38:40.220]  like, part of what makes QR codes so ugly
[38:40.220 --> 38:41.900]  is that they're just, they just look like
[38:41.900 --> 38:42.880]  black and white static.
[38:42.880 --> 38:44.300]  It's just dorky.
[38:44.300 --> 38:46.080]  It's, yeah.
[38:46.080 --> 38:49.920]  But much like the, you know, universal product codes
[38:49.920 --> 38:53.280]  that have been around, I guess, since the 70s,
[38:53.280 --> 38:56.480]  maybe the 80s, I know that I was a very young kid
[38:56.480 --> 38:59.040]  when they first started appearing on every product.
[39:01.060 --> 39:04.680]  They're, you know, and, you know, UPC codes,
[39:04.680 --> 39:07.320]  they are ugly, and, you know, I don't even know,
[39:07.320 --> 39:09.160]  like, does Apple, I guess Apple does put them
[39:09.160 --> 39:10.000]  on their products.
[39:10.000 --> 39:11.000]  I think there's some kind, you know,
[39:11.000 --> 39:12.400]  like, laws that you have to,
[39:12.400 --> 39:14.820]  but you know it kind of bugs them to do it
[39:14.820 --> 39:16.220]  because they are ugly.
[39:16.220 --> 39:18.040]  But they're not as ugly as QR codes
[39:18.040 --> 39:20.400]  because QR codes go in two dimensions,
[39:20.400 --> 39:24.160]  whereas the UPC code is just one-dimensional array
[39:24.160 --> 39:26.480]  of thin and thick lines.
[39:26.480 --> 39:30.420]  The QR code being a two-dimensional square of static
[39:30.420 --> 39:33.560]  is really ugly, but they're very easy to print.
[39:33.560 --> 39:34.900]  You know, I've seen them, you know,
[39:34.900 --> 39:37.120]  you could just print them on whatever laser printer
[39:37.120 --> 39:38.880]  or inkjet printer you have, you know,
[39:38.880 --> 39:41.640]  and just spit them out and tape them to your wall.
[39:41.640 --> 39:43.280]  Like, if Apple's goal with these
[39:43.280 --> 39:45.180]  is to make these stickers look good,
[39:46.760 --> 39:48.120]  and they certainly do look attractive
[39:48.120 --> 39:51.800]  in their demos so far, but how do you get them?
[39:51.800 --> 39:54.120]  Like, if you can't just print them yourself.
[39:54.120 --> 39:55.560]  And that's the thing, I don't know.
[39:55.560 --> 39:59.940]  I mean, perhaps you'll be able to export a digital file,
[39:59.940 --> 40:02.240]  but if you want one with embedded NFC,
[40:02.240 --> 40:04.840]  you have to order them through a partner that Apple,
[40:04.840 --> 40:05.740]  and I don't know, is this like,
[40:05.740 --> 40:07.360]  is Moo.com gonna sell these,
[40:07.360 --> 40:10.760]  or is Apple gonna sell them themselves for a buck apiece?
[40:10.760 --> 40:12.360]  I have, I don't know.
[40:12.360 --> 40:13.960]  It'll be interesting to see that.
[40:13.960 --> 40:16.680]  I asked and they didn't say, so we'll see.
[40:16.680 --> 40:19.160]  All right, all right, let me take a break here.
[40:19.160 --> 40:21.520]  Thank our second sponsor of the show.
[40:21.520 --> 40:26.520]  It is our good friends at Feals, F-E-A-L-S.
[40:27.160 --> 40:28.360]  Do you experience stress?
[40:28.360 --> 40:30.520]  Do you have anxiety or chronic pain?
[40:30.520 --> 40:32.680]  Maybe trouble sleeping at least once a week?
[40:32.680 --> 40:35.400]  You are not alone, many people do.
[40:35.400 --> 40:40.400]  Feals is premium CBD delivered directly to your doorstep.
[40:40.560 --> 40:42.160]  What does Feals do?
[40:42.160 --> 40:45.120]  It naturally helps reduce stress, anxiety, pain,
[40:45.120 --> 40:47.820]  and sleeplessness, and it's easy to take.
[40:47.820 --> 40:49.680]  Just take a few drops, put it under your tongue,
[40:49.680 --> 40:52.280]  and you can feel the difference within minutes.
[40:52.280 --> 40:53.240]  Are you new to CBD?
[40:53.240 --> 40:55.360]  Most people are, it's a new thing.
[40:55.360 --> 40:58.120]  They make it easy to know what the heck to do.
[40:58.120 --> 40:59.200]  They have a free hotline.
[40:59.200 --> 41:01.680]  You can call them up, talk to them if you want,
[41:01.680 --> 41:04.180]  or what I would do, personally,
[41:04.180 --> 41:05.800]  I don't like talking to people,
[41:05.800 --> 41:07.400]  I would send them a text message.
[41:07.400 --> 41:09.480]  You can just do it all by text.
[41:09.480 --> 41:11.720]  Ask them what they think you should order,
[41:11.720 --> 41:13.960]  what you're looking for.
[41:13.960 --> 41:16.580]  They'll help you guide your personal experience,
[41:16.580 --> 41:18.040]  and it's totally natural.
[41:18.040 --> 41:21.660]  It is no high, no hangover, no addiction.
[41:21.660 --> 41:23.620]  It's not that type of substance.
[41:24.880 --> 41:26.480]  And they have a membership program.
[41:26.480 --> 41:27.480]  Join the Feals community.
[41:27.480 --> 41:29.480]  You get Feals delivered to your door every month.

[41:52.340 --> 41:54.180]  So go to Feals.com slash talk show.
[41:57.280 --> 41:59.400]  I guess the one last thing about app clips
[41:59.400 --> 42:03.360]  that I would like to talk about is that it is sort of,
[42:04.360 --> 42:06.720]  I've been waiting for this for decades.
[42:06.720 --> 42:08.320]  I mean, this is no exaggeration,
[42:08.320 --> 42:12.240]  of something with the sort of ease of use
[42:12.240 --> 42:15.480]  of just loading a webpage in terms of like,
[42:15.480 --> 42:18.740]  you know you're not really weighing your computer down
[42:18.740 --> 42:23.680]  or installing a thing, but not a webpage,
[42:23.680 --> 42:26.160]  not something that is just a URL
[42:26.160 --> 42:30.280]  that goes into a web browser and renders in the browser
[42:30.280 --> 42:34.160]  and has all the limits of a webpage and a web browser.
[42:34.160 --> 42:37.660]  And I know that the web browsers have added,
[42:37.660 --> 42:40.720]  and continue to add APIs and become more app-like
[42:40.720 --> 42:43.460]  over time, but there's still,
[42:43.460 --> 42:47.380]  it just seems like people have thought about things
[42:47.380 --> 42:49.320]  like this for a long time, like just here,
[42:49.320 --> 42:53.080]  just go here, instead of typing a crufty URL
[42:53.080 --> 42:56.160]  that's prone to typos, especially on your phone
[42:56.160 --> 42:57.480]  while you're out in public,
[42:58.500 --> 43:00.800]  just point your phone at this thing,
[43:00.800 --> 43:02.360]  or just hold it near this thing,
[43:02.360 --> 43:04.640]  and then a thing pops up, and you just hit a button,
[43:04.640 --> 43:06.040]  and now you've got the thing,
[43:06.040 --> 43:09.160]  but instead of being a webpage, it is an app,
[43:09.160 --> 43:14.160]  and it can maybe look better, load faster, store data,
[43:16.160 --> 43:19.240]  like you said, you can expand to the full app at some point
[43:19.240 --> 43:21.600]  and install the whole app, and then all the stuff
[43:21.600 --> 43:24.920]  you've already done in the app clip just moves over.
[43:24.920 --> 43:29.140]  But also, presumably, can guard your privacy in a way,
[43:29.140 --> 43:31.900]  you know, it's almost 100% certain
[43:31.900 --> 43:35.100]  that Apple has designed app clips with privacy in mind
[43:35.100 --> 43:39.120]  in a way that, as we're learning week by week,
[43:39.120 --> 43:40.560]  the web was not.
[43:41.540 --> 43:44.980]  Yes, and use all the sensors that are in your phone
[43:44.980 --> 43:47.740]  and the camera and all sorts of other things,
[43:47.740 --> 43:50.260]  and let's not forget, like, yes,
[43:50.260 --> 43:54.420]  this sounds pretty useful for the iPhones that we all have,
[43:54.420 --> 43:57.700]  but a lot of this seems to be setting things up
[43:57.700 --> 44:01.540]  for AR glasses, where those 10 megs
[44:01.540 --> 44:03.720]  have to go through to another device,
[44:03.720 --> 44:08.300]  they, you know, speed really is of the essence,
[44:08.300 --> 44:10.700]  but this idea of the physical world
[44:10.700 --> 44:14.880]  having these digital kind of portals or on-ramps
[44:14.880 --> 44:18.240]  is really interesting in the context of, you know,
[44:18.240 --> 44:20.420]  actually being able to see them with glasses
[44:20.420 --> 44:23.080]  and then use them on that screen
[44:23.080 --> 44:24.020]  that's right in front of you.
[44:24.020 --> 44:28.620]  So I have no idea what those types of experiences will be.
[44:28.620 --> 44:30.500]  I'm sure I could, you know,
[44:30.500 --> 44:32.660]  take an edible and come up with some ideas,
[44:32.660 --> 44:37.000]  but, you know, I think that's obviously
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.940]  where a lot of this is kind of being set up for,
[44:39.940 --> 44:42.460]  and as I say, I think in the piece,
[44:42.460 --> 44:45.620]  Apple is very good at setting future Apple up for success,
[44:45.620 --> 44:47.720]  and I think this is an example of that.
[44:49.300 --> 44:50.980]  Yeah, and I think, you know,
[44:50.980 --> 44:53.740]  and I keep thinking back to Apple Pay,
[44:53.740 --> 44:56.180]  and I forget how many years ago Apple Pay first came out,
[44:56.180 --> 45:01.180]  but, you know, they're a very patient company
[45:01.600 --> 45:03.460]  even though it doesn't seem like they're patient
[45:03.460 --> 45:06.820]  because they keep moving things forward every year,
[45:06.820 --> 45:08.780]  but there are things they do
[45:08.780 --> 45:12.440]  that they know are not gonna pay off for five years,
[45:12.440 --> 45:15.500]  you know, and Apple Pay is certainly one of them,
[45:15.500 --> 45:18.420]  and I think, like, when Apple Pay first came out
[45:18.420 --> 45:21.380]  and six months later, there were initial numbers
[45:21.380 --> 45:24.740]  of what percentage of U.S. retail transactions
[45:24.740 --> 45:26.060]  were going through Apple Pay,
[45:26.060 --> 45:28.000]  and people were rolling their eyes,
[45:28.000 --> 45:29.780]  like, oh my God, almost nobody's using it.
[45:29.780 --> 45:31.140]  Well, it's like, even in,
[45:31.140 --> 45:33.100]  I don't know what the best case scenario was,
[45:33.100 --> 45:36.940]  but that's the sort of shift in consumer habits
[45:36.940 --> 45:39.760]  that is obviously a long-term play.
[45:41.220 --> 45:42.740]  I remember at the time reading
[45:42.740 --> 45:44.700]  about, like, the history of credit cards,
[45:44.700 --> 45:45.960]  and I know you're a credit card,
[45:45.960 --> 45:49.120]  you're a much bigger credit card nerd than me,
[45:49.120 --> 45:52.060]  but, like, when credit cards first became a thing,
[45:52.060 --> 45:54.420]  like, I think it was the 60s, right,
[45:54.420 --> 45:56.940]  like, with diners card and stuff,
[45:56.940 --> 45:58.500]  very few people used them,
[45:58.500 --> 46:01.180]  and the idea was bizarre, you know,
[46:01.180 --> 46:03.900]  that you just give, you go to a restaurant
[46:03.900 --> 46:07.840]  and give somebody a piece of plastic with numbers on it,
[46:07.840 --> 46:09.820]  and they walk away with it and come back,
[46:09.820 --> 46:13.220]  and you just, that counts as paying your bill?
[46:13.220 --> 46:15.440]  It was very strange, and, you know,
[46:15.440 --> 46:17.780]  it is kind of wild when you think about the fact
[46:17.780 --> 46:22.660]  that credit cards were truly like an honor system
[46:22.660 --> 46:25.700]  until, I don't know, some point in the 80s,
[46:25.700 --> 46:29.260]  when there was some kind of networking and communication,
[46:29.260 --> 46:33.180]  but I remember going to Kmart, in particular, with my mom.
[46:33.180 --> 46:34.980]  My mom had a credit card,
[46:34.980 --> 46:38.300]  and they had, like, a phone book full of, like,
[46:38.300 --> 46:39.740]  I don't know if they were the good numbers
[46:39.740 --> 46:42.940]  or the bad numbers, like, a phone book
[46:42.940 --> 46:46.540]  full of, like, MasterCard numbers and Visa numbers,
[46:46.540 --> 46:48.860]  and my mom would give the credit card over,
[46:48.860 --> 46:50.780]  and then the clerk would go through the phone book
[46:50.780 --> 46:51.780]  and look for the number.
[46:51.780 --> 46:53.380]  I don't, I never could figure out
[46:53.380 --> 46:55.660]  if they were looking for, like, okay, it's in here,
[46:55.660 --> 46:58.640]  or it's, you know, like, is it a,
[47:00.100 --> 47:02.120]  allow, you know, a list of good numbers,
[47:02.120 --> 47:04.180]  or a list of, you know, these are the ones
[47:04.180 --> 47:06.060]  that people have ripped off,
[47:06.060 --> 47:07.580]  but they'd look it up in a book,
[47:07.580 --> 47:09.500]  and I guess they got, like, a new book every month
[47:09.500 --> 47:11.920]  or every couple months, and it's crazy
[47:11.920 --> 47:13.660]  that that's how credit cards worked.
[47:13.660 --> 47:15.480]  Took a long time to take off, you know,
[47:15.480 --> 47:18.180]  and I think that contactless payment with phones
[47:18.180 --> 47:19.620]  is taking off faster than that,
[47:19.620 --> 47:22.180]  but it certainly seems like AppClip
[47:22.180 --> 47:24.060]  is the same sort of thing, where the real payoff,
[47:24.060 --> 47:28.260]  if it takes off, it might be five to 10 years in the future.
[47:28.260 --> 47:29.100]  Yep.
[47:31.140 --> 47:33.300]  I think that the idea that they're thinking
[47:33.300 --> 47:35.880]  about AR already has gotta be true, right?
[47:35.880 --> 47:40.880]  It has to be, because it's so clearly,
[47:41.620 --> 47:43.660]  you don't even have to know the exact nature
[47:43.660 --> 47:47.200]  of what they're thinking the AR glasses product will be,
[47:47.200 --> 47:50.720]  to imagine that having some kind of card come up
[47:50.720 --> 47:54.060]  when you're in Starbucks that you can see,
[47:54.060 --> 47:55.900]  but it's really just sort of a card,
[47:55.900 --> 47:58.340]  and it doesn't have anywhere near the depth
[47:58.340 --> 48:02.820]  of screens and hierarchy that a full iPhone app would have,
[48:02.820 --> 48:04.940]  because that just seems, no matter how good
[48:04.940 --> 48:07.300]  the experience with AR is, it doesn't seem appropriate,
[48:07.300 --> 48:10.100]  right, it just seems like a sort of shallow,
[48:10.100 --> 48:13.140]  card-like interface is just what the doctor ordered.
[48:13.140 --> 48:17.400]  Yeah, something very simple and one-dimensional.
[48:18.500 --> 48:19.340]  Yeah.
[48:19.340 --> 48:20.180]  We'll see.
[48:21.300 --> 48:22.140]  Yeah.
[48:23.680 --> 48:24.580]  What else?
[48:24.580 --> 48:26.940]  Anything else from WWDC that really jumped out to you?
[48:26.940 --> 48:29.660]  I'm curious, since it's been something
[48:29.660 --> 48:33.220]  we've been thinking and talking about for decades,
[48:34.740 --> 48:38.720]  how the Apple Silicon announcement
[48:38.720 --> 48:42.940]  kind of fit your expectations as expected,
[48:42.940 --> 48:45.540]  or different than what you thought it might be?
[48:47.140 --> 48:49.580]  It was very much in line with what I expected,
[48:49.580 --> 48:52.580]  and I think, if I was wrong,
[48:52.580 --> 48:54.580]  and a couple people have found the places,
[48:54.580 --> 48:57.660]  the only area where I think I've been wrong for years on it
[48:57.660 --> 49:01.340]  was that I thought it would happen a couple of years sooner.
[49:01.340 --> 49:04.900]  I think that there was a post in Daring Fireball,
[49:04.900 --> 49:09.780]  like in 2017, where people thought I was being coy
[49:09.780 --> 49:10.900]  and dropping one of those hints
[49:10.900 --> 49:12.140]  where I actually know something,
[49:12.140 --> 49:14.780]  but just sort of act like I'm predicting it,
[49:14.780 --> 49:16.860]  and said something like, next year,
[49:16.860 --> 49:19.260]  when there's arm-based max, or something like that.
[49:19.260 --> 49:21.100]  And I was just being a wiseacre,
[49:21.100 --> 49:23.140]  because I obviously didn't know that.
[49:23.140 --> 49:28.140]  But other than maybe me being a little bit more aggressive
[49:28.780 --> 49:30.820]  on what I thought they could do,
[49:30.820 --> 49:32.820]  pretty much played out as I expected.
[49:34.060 --> 49:37.860]  I think the one thing people are really getting wrong,
[49:37.860 --> 49:41.540]  and on my show last week, Federighi even said it,
[49:41.540 --> 49:45.020]  was that you can't judge the performance
[49:45.020 --> 49:48.420]  of Mac on Apple Silicon by these developer kits
[49:48.420 --> 49:49.420]  that are actually starting
[49:49.420 --> 49:51.020]  to get in developer hands today.
[49:51.020 --> 49:53.660]  I actually know a couple of friends who got them today.
[49:54.940 --> 49:58.420]  But that this, paraphrasing Federighi on my show,
[49:58.420 --> 50:02.220]  that they run fine, they're good,
[50:02.220 --> 50:03.780]  but that it really only shows
[50:03.780 --> 50:05.780]  what their chip team is capable of
[50:05.780 --> 50:07.420]  when they're not even trying,
[50:07.420 --> 50:09.580]  because this isn't designed for the Mac at all.
[50:09.580 --> 50:12.060]  It's literally just the A12Z from the iPad.
[50:14.340 --> 50:15.180]  And I think that's what people
[50:15.180 --> 50:16.700]  are getting the wrong impression on,
[50:16.700 --> 50:19.500]  because Apple's in a tight spot
[50:19.500 --> 50:23.380]  where they really wanna hold their powder
[50:23.380 --> 50:26.300]  to brag about how awesome their chips are gonna be
[50:26.300 --> 50:27.980]  for when they're ready to sell them,
[50:27.980 --> 50:29.100]  because that's just how they are,
[50:29.100 --> 50:30.500]  and it's actually smarter marketing.
[50:30.500 --> 50:32.140]  You don't wanna get people too excited about them
[50:32.140 --> 50:34.140]  before they can buy them.
[50:34.140 --> 50:36.620]  But on the other hand, they kinda wanted to leave the hints
[50:36.620 --> 50:39.660]  that, hey, these are gonna be really fast.
[50:39.660 --> 50:43.540]  Yeah, I wonder if, is Geekbench allowed
[50:43.540 --> 50:45.460]  as per the borrowing terms,
[50:45.460 --> 50:48.020]  or are you not allowed to do that?
[50:48.940 --> 50:53.540]  So, we're recording at the wrong time for this.
[50:55.020 --> 50:57.980]  So, you can run Geekbench,
[50:57.980 --> 51:02.100]  but Geekbench hasn't been recompiled for ARM,
[51:02.100 --> 51:03.620]  so you're really only running,
[51:03.620 --> 51:06.140]  you're not testing the hardware,
[51:06.140 --> 51:10.780]  you're testing the Rosetta 2 emulation of x86
[51:10.780 --> 51:13.340]  on the hardware.
[51:13.340 --> 51:14.580]  And I believe, now,
[51:14.580 --> 51:17.700]  I don't have the Dell Developer Transition Kit.
[51:17.700 --> 51:21.340]  I didn't order one, because I don't,
[51:21.340 --> 51:23.460]  I have enough stuff to do this summer,
[51:23.460 --> 51:27.500]  and I feel like the last thing I need is another computer.
[51:27.500 --> 51:30.100]  And I know that it's not indicative
[51:30.100 --> 51:32.900]  of what they're going to actually ship.
[51:32.900 --> 51:36.700]  And so, not that I'm not interested,
[51:36.700 --> 51:37.940]  but I feel like here's something
[51:37.940 --> 51:39.580]  I can just let other people do,
[51:39.580 --> 51:41.140]  and I'll read what they say,
[51:41.140 --> 51:44.220]  and the great privilege of the format of Daring Fireball
[51:44.220 --> 51:46.620]  is if somebody else writes something really awesome,
[51:46.620 --> 51:47.780]  I just link to it,
[51:47.780 --> 51:50.700]  and then it's like, check it off my list, there you go.
[51:50.700 --> 51:52.100]  Somebody wrote an awesome piece
[51:52.100 --> 51:55.060]  about the Developer Transition Kit hardware,
[51:55.060 --> 51:56.020]  I'll just link to it.
[51:56.020 --> 51:58.700]  Here, go read, this person's great write-up.
[52:00.580 --> 52:02.380]  So, I didn't agree to any terms,
[52:02.380 --> 52:03.620]  because I don't have one.
[52:04.620 --> 52:07.220]  So, I could say that somebody on Twitter,
[52:07.220 --> 52:08.940]  I saw somebody on Twitter was posting,
[52:08.940 --> 52:10.900]  and I think that the Geekbench numbers
[52:10.900 --> 52:13.660]  look sort of like those of,
[52:13.660 --> 52:16.260]  roughly speaking, like a 2015 iMac,
[52:17.540 --> 52:19.100]  which doesn't seem great,
[52:19.100 --> 52:22.420]  because that's five years old as a Mac,
[52:22.420 --> 52:23.660]  but you have to remember,
[52:25.660 --> 52:27.580]  it's running an emulation,
[52:27.580 --> 52:32.060]  and it is a benchmark, so it's supposed to be taxing.
[52:32.060 --> 52:34.340]  So, off the top of my head,
[52:34.340 --> 52:37.660]  I would say for a Developer Transition Kit,
[52:37.660 --> 52:41.420]  running a chip that's not even designed to run a Mac,
[52:41.420 --> 52:43.620]  it's from an iPad,
[52:43.620 --> 52:48.620]  running an x86 to ARM emulation,
[52:48.840 --> 52:53.840]  getting the speed from a 15, $1,600 Mac from five years ago
[52:54.740 --> 52:55.580]  is pretty good.
[52:55.580 --> 52:56.420]  Sounds good to me.
[52:56.420 --> 52:58.500]  I mean, do you remember soft Windows 95,
[52:58.500 --> 52:59.420]  what that ran like?
[52:59.420 --> 53:02.180]  You could barely play Minesweeper.
[53:02.180 --> 53:03.780]  I remember all of those,
[53:03.780 --> 53:06.460]  because, just another callback,
[53:06.460 --> 53:09.060]  to being a web developer in the 90s,
[53:11.820 --> 53:15.020]  the best way to do it was to actually just have a PC
[53:15.020 --> 53:15.860]  next to you,
[53:15.860 --> 53:18.900]  and you'd either do all your development
[53:18.900 --> 53:20.500]  in home site on a PC,
[53:20.500 --> 53:22.620]  and then turn around and test it on a Mac,
[53:22.620 --> 53:25.340]  or you'd do all your development in BBEdit on a Mac,
[53:25.340 --> 53:27.660]  and then turn around and test it on a PC,
[53:27.660 --> 53:30.300]  so you could test it in all the popular browsers.
[53:30.300 --> 53:31.380]  I didn't have a PC.
[53:31.380 --> 53:33.420]  I didn't, A, didn't want to buy one,
[53:33.420 --> 53:34.460]  didn't have room for one,
[53:34.460 --> 53:37.460]  and so I just ran, like, what was it called?
[53:37.460 --> 53:40.680]  Virtual PC was the one I had.
[53:40.680 --> 53:42.180]  That was one of the, I had that.
[53:42.180 --> 53:44.440]  I had soft Windows 95, I remember,
[53:44.440 --> 53:46.880]  which was like a full-on software emulator,
[53:46.880 --> 53:47.880]  which was not good.
[53:47.880 --> 53:48.720]  Yeah.
[53:50.120 --> 53:51.220]  They were all not good.
[53:51.220 --> 53:52.060]  They were good enough
[53:52.060 --> 53:54.580]  in that they were running the actual code,
[53:54.580 --> 53:57.860]  and so for testing the visual fidelity of a website,
[53:57.860 --> 53:59.020]  they were great,
[53:59.020 --> 54:00.860]  because if it looked good,
[54:00.860 --> 54:02.180]  and then you knew it would be good,
[54:02.180 --> 54:03.700]  they just weren't any,
[54:03.700 --> 54:05.660]  they were so slow that it was no way
[54:05.660 --> 54:07.420]  to judge the actual load time.
[54:07.420 --> 54:08.260]  Yeah.
[54:09.540 --> 54:10.580]  But I remember them well.
[54:10.580 --> 54:11.740]  Do you remember,
[54:11.740 --> 54:13.860]  so while we're talking about emulators,
[54:13.860 --> 54:15.940]  do you remember, it was like around 2000,
[54:15.940 --> 54:19.580]  you could buy a PlayStation emulator for the Mac,
[54:19.580 --> 54:23.700]  and actually play PlayStation discs natively?
[54:23.700 --> 54:25.180]  No, I don't remember this at all.
[54:25.180 --> 54:26.020]  I forgot the name of it.
[54:26.020 --> 54:27.260]  It was super weird, though.
[54:27.260 --> 54:28.560]  It was so random,
[54:28.560 --> 54:30.140]  and there were no good controllers,
[54:30.140 --> 54:33.820]  so you were playing PlayStation games on a Mac.
[54:34.820 --> 54:36.220]  Without a PlayStation controller.
[54:36.220 --> 54:39.700]  And of course, like the 640 by 480 VGA screen
[54:39.700 --> 54:41.500]  looked so crappy on a,
[54:41.500 --> 54:44.260]  I think I was using a Power Mac,
[54:44.260 --> 54:48.340]  or the laptops, PowerBook G3 at that point, but.
[54:48.340 --> 54:49.180]  Yeah, PowerBook.
[54:50.640 --> 54:52.980]  Do you think, now, also going back,
[54:52.980 --> 54:54.460]  probably too early,
[54:54.460 --> 54:57.660]  they used to sell a desktop Mac
[54:57.660 --> 55:02.420]  that had a Intel chip and a PowerPC chip in it.
[55:02.420 --> 55:03.520]  Do you think they will?
[55:03.520 --> 55:04.360]  Yeah.
[55:04.360 --> 55:06.320]  And those were probably super unpopular.
[55:07.240 --> 55:08.080]  I think that was even.
[55:08.080 --> 55:09.020]  I forget what that was called.
[55:09.020 --> 55:11.660]  Yeah, I think that was before Steve came back,
[55:11.660 --> 55:16.660]  but do you think there would be like a Mac Pro board
[55:16.700 --> 55:17.980]  that you could run Intel
[55:17.980 --> 55:22.980]  and also run Apple Silicon in the same tower?
[55:23.360 --> 55:27.120]  The Mac Pro is a big question mark,
[55:27.120 --> 55:28.700]  because the Mac Pro,
[55:28.700 --> 55:32.220]  the new modern Mac Pro that's now six months old
[55:32.220 --> 55:36.140]  is such a beast of a architecture,
[55:36.140 --> 55:40.220]  and it has those boards that you can swap in,
[55:40.220 --> 55:41.760]  and as obvious.
[55:41.760 --> 55:44.380]  So I'm not gonna say no with the Mac Pro,
[55:44.380 --> 55:45.980]  that there would be some sort of way
[55:45.980 --> 55:49.500]  that you could just buy like a PC on a board
[55:49.500 --> 55:52.040]  that you just stick into a new Mac Pro,
[55:52.040 --> 55:54.900]  and now you've got an Intel-based computer
[55:54.900 --> 55:59.380]  inside your Apple Silicon Mac Pro computer,
[55:59.380 --> 56:02.980]  but for all other Macs,
[56:02.980 --> 56:04.540]  including even the iMac Pro,
[56:04.540 --> 56:06.420]  I don't think that's feasible.
[56:06.420 --> 56:08.220]  I just don't think it's a good idea.
[56:10.780 --> 56:12.300]  But I don't think so,
[56:12.300 --> 56:14.180]  because it's always weird,
[56:14.180 --> 56:15.660]  because even with the old Mac
[56:15.660 --> 56:17.300]  that had the two cards,
[56:17.300 --> 56:18.780]  it was like you ran Windows,
[56:18.780 --> 56:21.820]  and in the Mac it looked like an app,
[56:21.820 --> 56:24.640]  but it really was running the operating system
[56:24.640 --> 56:27.380]  on an entirely different CPU.
[56:27.380 --> 56:28.220]  Super weird.
[56:28.220 --> 56:29.300]  In the box.
[56:29.300 --> 56:31.260]  Yeah, it was weird.
[56:31.260 --> 56:32.300]  And so it was sort of like
[56:32.300 --> 56:34.820]  having two computers running at once,
[56:34.820 --> 56:36.740]  but the secondary computer
[56:36.740 --> 56:40.740]  was projecting its video out
[56:40.740 --> 56:42.800]  into a window on your Mac.
[56:42.800 --> 56:44.720]  You know, like instead of going
[56:44.720 --> 56:46.360]  to a real video outsource,
[56:46.360 --> 56:50.220]  it was going into a window in the other computer.
[56:50.220 --> 56:52.400]  It was all very weird.
[56:52.400 --> 56:54.040]  Like I'm not sure what you buy from that.
[56:54.040 --> 56:55.360]  I'm not sure what you get.
[56:55.360 --> 57:00.180]  I think that it sounds like an interesting idea,
[57:00.180 --> 57:02.920]  and it certainly sounds like at some technical level,
[57:02.920 --> 57:06.180]  the Mac Pro could support a PC on a card
[57:06.180 --> 57:08.000]  that you just stick into one of those slots,
[57:08.000 --> 57:09.520]  but what would you actually do?
[57:09.520 --> 57:10.840]  How would it actually work?
[57:10.840 --> 57:12.240]  Why not just buy a PC?
[57:12.240 --> 57:13.240]  Yeah, especially these days.
[57:13.240 --> 57:16.580]  The network is so fast you can run it wherever, you know?
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.280]  Do you think that the first wave
[57:20.280 --> 57:23.760]  of Apple Silicon-powered Macs
[57:23.760 --> 57:28.760]  will be like super dramatic industrial design different,
[57:29.020 --> 57:32.800]  or will they be like the first wave of Intel Macs
[57:32.800 --> 57:34.940]  that were pretty similar?
[57:36.240 --> 57:39.040]  Well, I think they'll be dramatic.
[57:39.040 --> 57:42.940]  I feel, and some of the Intel ones were dramatic,
[57:42.940 --> 57:43.780]  like the-
[57:43.780 --> 57:45.940]  The MacBook, the plastic MacBook, yeah.
[57:45.940 --> 57:50.060]  Yeah, yeah, so they got rid of what they called the iBook,
[57:50.060 --> 57:52.540]  which was the consumer version of the PowerBook
[57:52.540 --> 57:55.520]  in the PowerPC era, and called the MacBooks,
[57:56.820 --> 57:57.660]  which is so funny,
[57:57.660 --> 58:01.060]  because it's a name they keep coming up with,
[58:01.060 --> 58:03.260]  and they're always very striking,
[58:03.260 --> 58:04.500]  and then they go away,
[58:04.500 --> 58:08.020]  and then there is no more computer just called MacBook,
[58:08.020 --> 58:11.440]  but the MacBooks were those black and white plastic-y ones,
[58:11.440 --> 58:13.760]  and everybody remembers the black one looked cooler,
[58:13.760 --> 58:16.140]  and also cost more.
[58:16.140 --> 58:20.960]  It's still one of my favorite little footnotes
[58:20.960 --> 58:24.660]  of Apple history, that they literally charged more
[58:24.660 --> 58:28.860]  for a black version of the same computer,
[58:28.860 --> 58:31.300]  and I've still, even off the record,
[58:31.300 --> 58:33.780]  have never heard what the deal is with that,
[58:33.780 --> 58:35.500]  if they really were just charging
[58:35.500 --> 58:37.100]  because they knew it looked so much better,
[58:37.100 --> 58:39.140]  or if it actually did cost more.
[58:39.140 --> 58:39.980]  You know, like-
[58:39.980 --> 58:43.140]  I think the minimum configuration was higher.
[58:43.140 --> 58:43.980]  Yeah, yeah.
[58:43.980 --> 58:45.260]  I made Henry Blodgett buy me one.
[58:45.260 --> 58:49.820]  That was my first computer at Alley Insider in 2007.
[58:49.820 --> 58:50.820]  Right. It was awesome.
[58:50.820 --> 58:51.980]  It was a great machine.
[58:53.120 --> 58:55.420]  Yeah, I do think that that was part of it, too,
[58:55.420 --> 58:57.840]  that, yeah, the minimum configuration was higher,
[58:57.840 --> 59:00.620]  and maybe spec for spec, they were the same price,
[59:00.620 --> 59:03.500]  but basically, if you just walked in the Apple store,
[59:03.500 --> 59:06.240]  looked at the two, thought the black one was cooler,
[59:06.240 --> 59:09.940]  you were looking at at least $100 extra outlay, which,
[59:09.940 --> 59:12.540]  but they were totally cooler looking computers
[59:12.540 --> 59:14.060]  than the iBooks that came before them.
[59:14.060 --> 59:18.740]  I think that, to answer your question,
[59:18.740 --> 59:20.780]  I think that the first,
[59:20.780 --> 59:22.380]  I don't think there's gonna be any confusion
[59:22.380 --> 59:26.180]  over which Macs are the new Apple Silicon ones,
[59:26.180 --> 59:30.040]  and which ones are the older Intel ones.
[59:30.040 --> 59:33.420]  Maybe with the iMac, they'll do something.
[59:33.420 --> 59:35.540]  I mean, the iMac, as we know it,
[59:35.540 --> 59:37.180]  is sort of long in the tooth,
[59:37.180 --> 59:38.980]  and it hasn't been updated for a while.
[59:38.980 --> 59:41.100]  The iMac Pro has never been updated.
[59:41.100 --> 59:42.020]  They came out with it.
[59:42.020 --> 59:46.100]  It got universally great reviews.
[59:47.460 --> 59:49.940]  Everybody acknowledges that it has
[59:49.940 --> 59:54.940]  a truly genius heating architecture
[59:55.300 --> 01:00:00.300]  to keep it from running hot, yet very, very quiet,
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:02.420]  and they've never updated it.
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:04.820]  So are they going to do another round of updates
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:06.620]  to the iMac while they're still on Intel?
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:08.760]  And if they do, are they gonna make them look new?
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:09.700]  I mean, there's room, you know,
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:12.260]  there's the chin, as we call it,
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:13.360]  at the bottom of the iMac,
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.940]  sorta looks outdated at this point.
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:17.460]  It seems like the iMac should just be all screen,
[01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:20.760]  and it's not, and are they gonna wait?
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:21.820]  Are they really gonna make people
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:23.640]  keep buying the ones we have now
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.660]  that are kind of a couple years out of date
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:26.800]  for six more months,
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:29.380]  or are they going to give us a new one?
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:30.220]  I don't know.
[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:31.040]  So the iMac, maybe.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:33.000]  I think with MacBooks, though,
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.900]  the ARM ones are gonna look all new.
[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:37.300]  I don't know how, I mean,
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:38.360]  because I'm not a designer,
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.380]  but I would just guess thinner.
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:44.480]  I would guess just new design language screens
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.100]  that go closer to edge-to-edge.
[01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:47.620]  I think it's pretty telling
[01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:51.080]  that while they made the 16-inch MacBook Pro,
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.900]  you know, even bumping it up from 15-inch
[01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:56.020]  in terms of how big the screen size is,
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:58.560]  you know, they made it go closer to the side-to-side,
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.820]  but they didn't even do that with the 13-inch.
[01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:02.360]  You know, there certainly is a lot of room
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:05.700]  with the 13-inch to make it look a lot more modern.
[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:08.060]  I mean, I just even think back to that 12-inch MacBook
[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:09.260]  that I loved for so long
[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:11.300]  but just had such terrible battery life
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:13.460]  that, you know, that's the kind of thing where,
[01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:15.580]  and then you take the current iPad Pro,
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:18.300]  which is so thin and so fast,
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.620]  and, you know, yes, they don't have a keyboard
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:21.780]  they have to deal with,
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:25.860]  but, yeah, to me, that's gonna be the sweet spot
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:29.740]  is that kind of good consumer-level laptop
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:32.840]  where, you know, you could probably at least bump up
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.100]  to 10 real hours of battery life
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:39.100]  and probably make it a lot easier to have built-in cellular.
[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:43.600]  I know that was always an issue with the Intel MacBooks
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.620]  and a lot of stuff like that,
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:47.660]  and I've been waiting for it for years,
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:49.740]  so I'm actually really excited for that.
[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:53.740]  Yeah, I think something returning to the idea
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:57.680]  of the just plain MacBook from the last couple years,
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:02.420]  you know, not the 2006 one that was plastic,
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:04.900]  but the super thin and light one,
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:08.840]  they must return to that because the MacBook Air,
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:12.700]  the new MacBook Airs that are now like the flagship MacBooks
[01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:15.620]  in Apple's lineup, and they're great machines
[01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:18.380]  and they're pretty much exactly what I think,
[01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:23.380]  you know, the $1,100 to $1,300 Apple MacBook
[01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:25.620]  for most people should be.
[01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:26.860]  I think they're really great.
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:29.180]  I think they're nice and thin.
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:31.700]  You could make something a lot thinner, right?
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:34.260]  It's the MacBook that they got rid of
[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:36.180]  shows that they could make something a lot thinner.
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.880]  It's just that they were kind of slow
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.780]  and didn't get great battery life, you know?
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:41.860]  So if they could do something
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:44.240]  that's super impressively small like that,
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.540]  boy, I think that would sell.
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:50.780]  Cellular, I think is, you know,
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:53.220]  most people seem to be talking about touchscreens,
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:54.900]  and I guess we should talk about that.
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:55.940]  I'd love to hear if you think
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:57.300]  they're gonna do touchscreen Macs.
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:00.380]  If they do, I think that's clearly the time.
[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:01.660]  I don't even, and again,
[01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:05.740]  it's not because they can't do touchscreens on Intel,
[01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:08.060]  but if they're gonna have this line in the sand
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:10.360]  that we're doing this big transition,
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.700]  why not put as many of the transition-type things
[01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:16.880]  like there are no Macs with a touchscreen,
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.380]  and then there's a transition
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:21.820]  to there are some Macs with touchscreens.
[01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:25.100]  Why not have it all be the same line, right?
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:27.180]  And it certainly is a compelling argument
[01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:28.380]  in terms of selling it,
[01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:31.100]  and it would drive all the people nuts
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:33.100]  because Apple has spent years,
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:36.060]  it's very Apple-y to spend all of the years
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:37.660]  where they have no touchscreen Macs
[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:40.960]  saying we think touchscreens on the laptop form factor
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:44.020]  are a bad idea, and then until they do it,
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:46.520]  and then it's the best idea they've ever had,
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:49.780]  and they, of course, there's some aspect
[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:51.420]  to the introduction that makes it seem
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:53.420]  as though they invented it.
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:58.060]  And it just, I live for those moments
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:00.100]  to see the reactions from people.
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:02.580]  That was definitely the takeaway
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:07.580]  from the new UI for OS 11, I guess we're at now.
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:10.980]  I definitely saw a lot of tweets saying,
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:13.580]  oh, these touch targets are for fingers,
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:16.820]  not for mouse cursors or mouse buttons.
[01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:20.060]  It's so funny, because ever since I got
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:23.940]  the iPad Pro keyboard case with the trackpad,
[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:26.400]  I've almost never touched the screen anymore,
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:28.620]  except with the pencil.
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:32.540]  So I don't know, I don't know if I,
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:35.580]  there are some places where it's super useful,
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:40.580]  but if anything, I'm less interested in a touchscreen.
[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:43.340]  It might be nice, though, to have pencil support,
[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:46.580]  and it really depends on the balance of weight.
[01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:48.100]  If you're poking at the screen
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:50.100]  and it's flopping the computer around.
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:53.760]  But I would say that on the balance,
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:58.500]  I'm probably more, I'd be less, far less surprised
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:02.020]  if they did integrate touch into the Mac
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:05.420]  than before just by seeing the,
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:09.140]  kind of the new paradigm of the Mac UI.
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:11.900]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:14.260]  Some people seem to look at the new 10,
[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:16.860]  or not 10, it's actually a Mac OS 11 now,
[01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:20.820]  but people look at Big Sur, and some people look at it
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:25.200]  and seem to think this is definitely for a touchscreen,
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.820]  because some things have a little bit more space
[01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:31.580]  and some of the icons look more like iPad icons.
[01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:33.860]  I see some of what they're saying,
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:36.860]  but there's a lot to me that doesn't look
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:39.140]  any more touch-friendly than it ever was,
[01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:41.220]  and that doesn't mean that I think it's not gonna happen.
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:43.820]  I just, I think people are seeing what they wanna see.
[01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:48.820]  I think the people who seem to think it is a clear predictor
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:52.420]  of touchscreen support in the ARM-based Macs
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:56.260]  coming next year seem to be a one-to-one correlation
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:59.140]  with the people who most want it to happen,
[01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:02.300]  as opposed to sort of objectively looking at it.
[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:04.180]  And on that particular point,
[01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:06.780]  I feel pretty objective about it.
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:09.900]  I'm not opposed to it, I'm just not dying for it either.
[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:11.960]  I really don't feel strongly about it.
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:13.900]  The only part I feel very strongly about
[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:17.180]  is I really, really, and I don't think it's gonna happen,
[01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:21.040]  I would hate to see the Mac go to an interface
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:25.420]  where everything is expected and has to be sized for touch,
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:28.420]  because there's so much good Mac software
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:30.500]  where the information density,
[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.580]  you know, they just look at the palettes in Photoshop
[01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:34.960]  or any other app that's like Photoshop.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.940]  I don't wanna have a palette in Photoshop
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:40.380]  where all the buttons are double the size and spaced apart
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:44.580]  so that you can make them fingerprint friendly.
[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:46.660]  I like having them packed together.
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:49.080]  That's my only concern, and I think that's possible
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:53.340]  where you, you know, and I think it's the way they would go.
[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:55.580]  I think it's sort of like the inverse of the iPad
[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:57.300]  where the iPad is still touch first,
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:00.780]  but now it has a trackpad that you can use,
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:03.160]  but somebody who doesn't have one would never know it, right?
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:06.240]  My wife doesn't have the keyboard with the trackpad.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:09.300]  She uses her iPad as much as anybody I know.
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:11.800]  She uses her iPad more
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:15.300]  than her Mac and iPhone combined by far.
[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:16.660]  I don't know that she even knows
[01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:18.920]  that her iPad OS has trackpad support,
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:22.440]  because I don't know that she reads my website, right?
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.480]  But that's the way it should be.
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:24.760]  It still is, right?
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.680]  And I feel like the right way for the Mac
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.420]  to gain touchscreen support would be,
[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:30.600]  okay, so if you bought one that has a touchscreen,
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:33.960]  now you can scroll by putting your finger on your screen,
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:37.260]  but if you're still using your Mac connected to,
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:40.100]  you know, like if you just spent $6,000
[01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:43.780]  on an Apple whatever the display is called,
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:45.460]  which obviously doesn't have touch,
[01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:47.820]  it doesn't feel like you're left out, right?
[01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:48.640]  Totally, yeah.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.360]  So I feel like add, you know,
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:53.220]  the Mac is mouse first and touch second
[01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:55.700]  in the way that the iPad remains touch first
[01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:57.060]  and trackpad second.
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:57.900]  Yeah.
[01:07:57.900 --> 01:07:58.720]  I think that's possible.
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.460]  So another way of interpreting that is just like,
[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:03.140]  you know, the iPad is gonna look more like,
[01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:06.860]  perhaps even more like Big Sur at some point,
[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:09.780]  or, you know, if those visual paths
[01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:11.660]  are converging more and more,
[01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:14.100]  perhaps one of them will never get touch support,
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:15.500]  but if the idea is to make it
[01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.340]  so that they look more like each other,
[01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:18.580]  perhaps, I don't know.
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:21.660]  I don't know.
[01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:23.220]  We'll be, we'll be interested.
[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:24.760]  Have you installed, have you installed
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:25.600]  any of the betas yet?
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:26.420]  I have not.
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:28.380]  I usually wait for the public betas
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:31.860]  because I don't really have spare machines.
[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:34.300]  So, yeah.
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:35.260]  I keep thinking about it.
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:36.580]  I mentioned it with Bansarino.
[01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:38.340]  He was on my show last week,
[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:42.060]  but ordinarily, because I travel in the summer more,
[01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:43.300]  I depend on my phone,
[01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:47.100]  so I haven't installed betas on my regular iPhone for years
[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:48.820]  because I just can't take the chance,
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:50.480]  but I'm not going anywhere this summer,
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:52.180]  so I'm sort of like, why not?
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:54.360]  Yeah, the extra hits of the battery life
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:55.840]  does not matter at all.
[01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:58.700]  You know, it's like, I know a lot of people out there
[01:08:58.700 --> 01:08:59.540]  are cutting their own hair,
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:00.520]  and it's like, well, why not?
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:01.380]  I'm not going anywhere.
[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:03.660]  Nobody's seen me in, you know, months,
[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:04.940]  so what's the difference, you know?
[01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:06.500]  Yeah.
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.860]  So it's like, why not have a phone that's half brick?
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:10.420]  But everybody I know who's installed it
[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:14.020]  has said that they're seemingly on a ying-yang schedule
[01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:16.500]  where iOS 12, two years ago,
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.420]  everybody was like, this is the most stable beta
[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:19.700]  I've ever seen from Apple.
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:23.100]  This is actually more stable than iOS 11 was in production.
[01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:24.820]  This is fantastic.
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:25.660]  And then last year,
[01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:30.260]  iOS 13 was sort of one of the least stable releases
[01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:31.100]  they've ever had.
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.060]  Remember the weird release like in August
[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:35.820]  where they suddenly pulled the developer betas
[01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:37.660]  and, because like they kind of had to do
[01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:39.180]  a release to manufacturing,
[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:41.320]  and it wasn't really ready.
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:42.780]  And then it was really weird
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:47.780]  where like the initial wave of brand new iPhone 11s
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:52.780]  that came out in September had iPhone, iOS 11, or 13.0,
[01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:56.460]  but 13.1 came out like four days later.
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:57.300]  Yeah.
[01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:59.060]  I mean, it was weird.
[01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:01.220]  You know, it just, and you know,
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:03.380]  Apple didn't want to talk about it because they're Apple,
[01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:06.620]  but basically they were behind, you know?
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:07.700]  The software was behind.
[01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:09.540]  They had to ship because the hardware's coming
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:11.460]  and they did the best they could.
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:15.940]  And they kind of, you know, made it all work by October,
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:18.660]  which, you know, all credit to them.
[01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:20.840]  Well, I think that it seems like it balances up
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:23.580]  against the fewer, maybe new features this year
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:26.700]  is that the focus was on quality.
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:28.380]  And of course, any constraints
[01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:30.180]  from having people working at home too,
[01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:33.460]  I'm sure that slowed things down as well.
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:35.960]  I'm curious about that.
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:38.740]  And I sort of, if, you know, I always,
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:40.980]  after my live show or interview show,
[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:43.120]  whatever you want to call it, remote show this year,
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.000]  I always have the feeling, you know,
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.440]  the questions in the back of my head
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:49.720]  that I sort of wish I'd asked that I didn't ask.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:53.000]  And on my list, it wasn't that I forgot to ask,
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.280]  but it was just sort of, was in one of my question cards
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:58.820]  that it just felt like we ran out of time,
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:01.200]  was to talk about, you know, like,
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:02.160]  and I don't know what,
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:03.500]  I don't know if they would have answered it.
[01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:06.420]  I, you know, was it, I don't, I just don't know.
[01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:11.260]  But basically, has the work from home shift since March
[01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:14.260]  affected what they're working on?
[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:16.540]  Like, are they doing more bug fixes
[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:20.660]  because it's more amenable to engineers working at home?
[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:23.000]  Or is it sort of like, no, this is, you know,
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.080]  even if this hadn't happened with iOS,
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:26.680]  the iOS 14 you see today
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:29.480]  probably would have been pretty much the same?
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:30.680]  I don't think they would have answered,
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:33.640]  but I still think it's an interesting question.
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:34.560]  Here, let me take a break.
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:39.440]  I'll thank our third and final sponsor of the show,
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:42.000]  our good friends at Squarespace.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.320]  Squarespace is the all-in-one website,
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:49.680]  hosting, design, CMS, everything you want to do.
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:53.740]  To have your own website, you could do it at Squarespace.
[01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:56.640]  Next time you need a website, try it at Squarespace first.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:00.200]  Especially if somebody else comes to you and says,
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:02.320]  hey, you're a nerd, I know you know stuff.
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:03.160]  What should I do?
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:04.540]  I need a new website for my restaurant,
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:07.320]  my business, my portfolio.
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:09.280]  Have them go to Squarespace.
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.640]  And they'll thank you for it.
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:13.120]  Go to Squarespace and just start building it.
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.760]  You get a free trial.
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.440]  You can use it.
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.360]  Build the whole thing just the way you want it.
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:19.360]  And then when you're like, yeah,
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:20.600]  this is exactly what I want.
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.300]  This is perfect.
[01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:24.320]  You just switch to a paid account
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.080]  and what you've already built just moves right over
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:28.360]  and nobody knows the difference.
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.160]  Nobody knows outside your website
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.840]  that your free trial's over.
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.120]  You've shifted to paid.
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:34.480]  It just works.
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.320]  And they really do.
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:36.720]  They have everything.
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:39.500]  Design, templates to choose from.
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:40.800]  You could start from scratch.
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.600]  If you're a designer and you know CSS, HTML,
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.480]  that sort of thing, you can build your website
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:47.720]  from the ground up and have it look just the way you want.
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:51.360]  You can start with one of their designs and go from there.
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:53.680]  Really is great.
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:54.940]  I really do recommend it.
[01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:57.060]  And I know you say, well, how does Squarespace
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:00.640]  keep sponsoring the talk show almost every week?
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:02.640]  It's because people keep signing up with the code.
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.000]  So remember the code.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.440]  They'll know you keep coming.
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:07.280]  You keep sending people here.
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:09.320]  And the code saves you 10% off,
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:12.800]  which includes the ability to prepay for an entire year.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.160]  10%.
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.380]  So go to squarespace.com
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:19.320]  and the code is just plain talk show.
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:22.020]  At checkout, you get 10% off.
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:23.920]  My thanks to Squarespace.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:26.960]  You could even go to squarespace.com slash talk show
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:28.360]  and it has the code built in
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.760]  and they'll know you came from here.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:31.160]  So my thanks to Squarespace.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:35.980]  The only other thing I wanted to talk to you about,
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:37.520]  because I feel like I have to,
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:40.280]  is a little bit of media kibitzing.
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:41.400]  Oh yeah.
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:45.100]  You see, and there's a lot of it going on.
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:50.560]  I'm sort of nibbling around the edges of it.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:54.720]  And it's sort of coming together in a couple of ways.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.920]  The whole thing was social media networks
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:04.620]  sort of getting there,
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:07.120]  stopping trying to having it both ways.
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:10.480]  And just today, before we recorded,
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:13.640]  Reddit closed the Donald subreddit,
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:16.960]  which is where all the Trump fans
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.740]  got their hate on for years.
[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:22.460]  Twitter has, in recent weeks,
[01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:25.140]  started putting labels on the more egregious
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:28.980]  of Trump's tweets, and Facebook has not,
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:31.760]  and has really started to take flack for it
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:36.100]  and has seen a lot of big name advertisers
[01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:37.700]  not boycott them.
[01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:40.000]  It's an interesting dance.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.580]  And Coca Cola, to name one, and Unilever,
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:46.620]  which is a big, if you've never heard of Unilever,
[01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:50.940]  half of your supermarket is fully Unilever products.
[01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:55.380]  And they've said that they're going to just
[01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:58.060]  stop advertising on social media for six months
[01:14:58.060 --> 01:14:59.260]  and see what happens.
[01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:03.880]  Well, it happens to coincide with a massive recession,
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:06.640]  so it's not necessarily tied to controversy.
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:10.080]  But it just seems to me, my take on this,
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:12.560]  and again, maybe I'm the one seeing what I want to see here.
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.560]  Maybe I'm the one who's blinded by bias.
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:17.260]  But what I think is happening is that
[01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:19.980]  these social media groups, networks,
[01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:23.820]  have tried for years to sort of have it both ways
[01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:26.340]  where they're trying to say, everybody's welcome.
[01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:29.760]  We want the whole country, we want the whole world,
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:32.620]  whether you're on this side or that side
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:34.740]  of the political divide, no matter how extreme
[01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:36.640]  one of those sides might get,
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:39.280]  we're after the biggest audience,
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:41.240]  so we're gonna be the home to all of it,
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:45.240]  and that's the spirit of free speech.
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:49.400]  And you know, it sounds good until it starts going awry.
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:51.440]  And I feel like what's happened is that people are like,
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.500]  I don't want anything to do with this network
[01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:55.500]  if they're gonna allow X, Y, and Z.
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:58.320]  And so now you've got, you have to make a choice,
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:02.280]  which is we're going to allow this one side
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:07.000]  to post things that the other side finds unacceptable,
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.960]  or we're gonna lose one or the other.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:10.280]  If we say you're not allowed to do it,
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:11.960]  they're going to say you're biased against us
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:14.080]  because we're quote-unquote conservative.
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:19.600]  Or if they allow these people to post whatever they want,
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.120]  they're gonna lose people who say,
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.580]  I find this to be hateful.
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:25.500]  Curious what you think is going on
[01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:26.520]  and where you think it's heading.
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:29.640]  I mean, it's, you know, you look at Facebook,
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:32.640]  which is now 16 years old, something like that.
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:35.840]  You know, is it a utility?
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:38.960]  Is it like AT&T, where it just pushes
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:42.800]  whatever people on one end send to people on the other end?
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:43.980]  Is it a service?
[01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:45.720]  Is it a publisher?
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:48.040]  And you know, I think for a long time,
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:51.000]  Mark Zuckerberg described it as utility.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  In fact, he used to call it, I believe, a social utility.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.560]  But a social utility is not funded by advertising
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.560]  from the biggest companies in the world.
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:04.680]  And it runs an application layer
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:06.800]  and an application platform, in fact.
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:11.720]  And so, in the last four or five years, six years,
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:13.820]  you know, probably the biggest conversation
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:18.820]  in the tech industry is that these huge social networks,
[01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:21.460]  primarily Facebook, but also Twitter,
[01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:23.880]  to some degree, YouTube as well, Reddit,
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:27.760]  they need to take more responsibility for what they are.
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:31.260]  And you see that through varying degrees.
[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:35.420]  You know, even Twitter, which gets a lot of applause
[01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:39.960]  for the kind of, you know, little asterisks
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:42.580]  as they put on Trump tweets now.
[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:46.340]  Which is really what it amounts to.
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:48.300]  It's such a weenie thing, and it's so Twitter.
[01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:53.300]  But, you know, it's not an easy, by the way,
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:54.960]  not an easy problem to solve,
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:57.680]  and also not just a problem here in the US.
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:00.680]  Like, this was a much bigger problem
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:03.360]  in other countries before it was here,
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:05.480]  where people were actually being, you know,
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:07.600]  a lot of people were killed.
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.620]  But you could see also the severity of this,
[01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:14.620]  and how, I think people make it seem like it's so easy
[01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:18.080]  for Mark Zuckerberg to just make one decision
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.600]  and that will solve everything.
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:20.920]  That's just not the case.
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:23.200]  Like, these are complicated problems
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.480]  that are different everywhere.
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:27.060]  There are places where there are laws.
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:29.120]  There are places where there aren't laws.
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:33.200]  You know, there's probably a lot of Americans
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:36.920]  who wish that Twitter would just delete Trump's account.
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:39.640]  And you could make a very good case
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:41.800]  for why that should not be allowed either.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  If Twitter decides we are a journalistic entity,
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:49.840]  you know, we're a publisher,
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:52.340]  of course then it can have whatever,
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:54.280]  you know, then it can publish whatever it wants,
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:57.000]  and not publish whatever it wants.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.240]  But I don't think anyone wants that
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:00.640]  from Twitter or Facebook either.
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:03.260]  I don't think they want the effective, you know,
[01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.380]  the equivalent of the app review process
[01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:08.880]  for every single post that goes through these services.
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.680]  That's kind of not even possible.
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:12.580]  There's just so much content that flows through them,
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:15.300]  and so many people using them.
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:17.940]  You know, imagine the app queue for approval
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:19.520]  if there were two billion developers
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:21.720]  trying to ship updates every day.
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:23.080]  Like, that just wouldn't really work.
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:27.040]  So it's not an easy problem to solve.
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:29.440]  You also can't really say with a straight face
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:32.240]  that any of these companies are doing a great job at it,
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:34.600]  especially not Facebook,
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:37.320]  especially not YouTube and Twitter.
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:40.880]  There's just so much bad stuff that happens as well.
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:45.000]  And this is just gonna be part of the reality
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.440]  for quite a long time.
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:49.120]  I mean, you know, we're not close to having
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:52.280]  near perfect AI analysis of speech
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:55.240]  that would like, you know, rule out all,
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:59.160]  but.01% of edge cases.
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:02.080]  That's just not really happening either, so.
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:02.920]  Yeah.
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:06.960]  I think it's really hard to put your finger on
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:09.280]  because I feel like what they've built
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:13.520]  are so nebulous in certain ways, these social networks,
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:17.020]  that analogies to anything else break down.
[01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:18.800]  But like, the phone network,
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:21.160]  the old-fashioned landline phone network
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.720]  was a true utility.
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:26.760]  It really, you know, you could put it in terms of,
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:28.280]  especially the pre-internet era,
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:30.400]  it was the definition of a utility.
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:31.820]  And when you picked up your phone,
[01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:33.760]  all you got was a dial tone,
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:35.560]  and it just meant your phone is working,
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:39.560]  and then you punched numbers in and got connected.
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.320]  You know, it's, everything changes.
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:44.160]  You can't really call it a utility
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:46.000]  when Facebook has an algorithm
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.620]  that suggests things to you, right?
[01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:51.800]  You know, and there were apps.
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:53.400]  We didn't call them apps, but I always,
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:56.880]  it's like, it shows how old I am that I remember it.
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:59.200]  But then there was even an entire Seinfeld episode
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:00.320]  about the movie phone.
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:02.760]  You know, like, that was how you found out
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:03.800]  what movies were playing.
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:07.040]  You'd call the, I swear to God, kids, this is what you did.
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:09.560]  And it was awesome because before movie phone,
[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:11.340]  you had to like find a newspaper
[01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:13.960]  and find the movie listing page and figure it out.
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.640]  Like, if you just wanted to figure out
[01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:18.040]  what movies were playing and where,
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:19.340]  you'd call a phone number.
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:21.280]  And there was a guy, and he'd tell you,
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:22.760]  you know, it was a recorded voice,
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:24.320]  and you'd punch in your zip code,
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:26.980]  and then he would say, you know, you can go to this movie
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:28.500]  theater and they've got this movie,
[01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.840]  and you'd hit seven to hear the times,
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:33.540]  and it was playing at seven and 9.30 p.m.
[01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:34.840]  at this movie theater.
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.600]  And then you'd tell your friends that's where it is,
[01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:39.600]  and you'd go, it's like, Facebook is more like
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:41.840]  you pick up your phone and your phone just says to you,
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:44.000]  would you like to talk to movie phone?
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:44.840]  You know what I mean?
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:47.520]  Like, that's, and that changes it from being a utility.
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:49.640]  It's different, you know?
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:51.280]  And I think the other thing, too,
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:54.600]  is that they've sort of backed themselves into a corner here
[01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:58.480]  where, and again, this analogy has all sorts of holes in it,
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:02.200]  but maybe in the 1950s, everybody went shopping downtown,
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:05.080]  and you'd go downtown, and that's where all the stores are,
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:07.280]  and because it was a public square,
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:09.400]  if somebody with a political message could stand
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:12.000]  on the corner and shout it because it was public.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.200]  And then in the 70s, everybody went to indoor shopping malls
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.840]  and they were all privately owned,
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:18.680]  and everybody went to the malls,
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:22.080]  but they wouldn't let kooks stand in this middle
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:24.160]  of the hallway and shout their stuff
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:25.600]  because it was privately owned.
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:28.320]  And then you could say, you're shutting down free speech
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.480]  because this is where everybody is.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:33.840]  But it's not a town square, it's a private property,
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:37.360]  and if they allow you to do it, then it's on them, right?
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.080]  And it's, I don't know what the solution is
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:42.800]  because you can't make everybody go back to going downtown
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:46.560]  where it is free and open and nobody controls it,
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:51.120]  but it is you, if you own the mall and you let a kook,
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:53.560]  whether they're left-wing kooks, right-wing kooks,
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:55.560]  religious kooks, whatever it is,
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:57.920]  if you just let them sit there with a megaphone
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:00.400]  and shout at people, that's on you.
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:03.360]  It is a complicated scenario.
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.960]  Anyway, we could do a whole show.
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:08.960]  Yeah, it's complicated, it's never gonna be perfect,
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:10.520]  but it certainly could be better,
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:14.320]  and yeah, we'll see what happens.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:15.160]  All right, always good to talk to you.
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:16.000]  Thank you so much.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.720]  I love talking to you after WWDC.
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:21.080]  Everybody can, what's the domain
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:21.920]  for new consumer?
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:23.640]  Newconsumer.com, yeah.
[01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:24.480]  Check it out.
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:25.880]  And that's your newsletter.
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:28.280]  I enjoy reading it, it feels like you're doing a great job.
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.120]  Thank you.
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.320]  I think.
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:31.160]  I'm having fun, so.
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:32.040]  Really, really great.
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.780]  That's part of it.
[01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:35.660]  Yeah, but you know what, I feel it.
[01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:37.120]  I can feel it in your writing.
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:39.880]  It feels like you're, I don't know,
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:43.320]  you could probably tell me, you know me well enough,
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:46.520]  you could tell when I'm in a good mood on Daring Fireball.
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:47.600]  Absolutely, yep.
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:51.360]  Newconsumer.com, and then on Twitter,
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:56.280]  of course you are from Dome, F-R-O-M-E, D-O-M-E,
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:59.120]  and you know, I don't know why I'd say that,
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.640]  because I'm sure everybody's already following you.
[01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:02.480]  Thanks, Dan.
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:14.040]  I would hope so, thank you.
