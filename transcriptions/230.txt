[00:00.000 --> 00:04.580]  I can't believe it took this long to get you on my show. I was on like two years ago
[00:05.880 --> 00:12.380]  Yeah, I I just feel like you should be back more often though, you know, yeah, you know we started doing a
[00:13.580 --> 00:18.700]  Interview episodes of the first chance maybe we can trade back and forth because we're doing we're doing second episodes every week now
[00:18.700 --> 00:22.220]  You know, I you know, I'm game for that
[00:23.340 --> 00:25.980]  We should do it. I think two years ago. We
[00:25.980 --> 00:30.440]  It was the the height of the headphone jack debate. We made people wait
[00:31.520 --> 00:37.820]  Over an hour before we actually addressed it which I thought was very clever on both of our parts. I
[00:41.120 --> 00:47.920]  Am still exhausted I find that this this I
[00:48.900 --> 00:53.520]  Always say like this for me is like for an accountant. This is like April 15th
[00:53.520 --> 00:56.840]  You know, this is this to me is super exhausting
[00:58.440 --> 01:02.040]  And you know, even though I put my watch review up
[01:02.600 --> 01:08.280]  Wednesday it's and now we're recording on Friday. I still feel like punch-drunk. I am
[01:08.920 --> 01:13.960]  it and I counted and I'm not trying to brag it it I'm just saying like
[01:14.720 --> 01:16.720]  It's it's a big number
[01:17.040 --> 01:18.480]  from
[01:18.480 --> 01:20.480]  the event until
[01:20.480 --> 01:24.580]  Wednesday at one when I finally put my watch review up I wrote
[01:25.880 --> 01:30.560]  12,200 words in three articles on during fireball. That's crazy
[01:31.240 --> 01:34.680]  It's more than you're doing lately. You're all podcast now. I
[01:35.520 --> 01:38.400]  Back, so did you did I didn't even?
[01:40.040 --> 01:41.440]  This is how
[01:41.440 --> 01:48.540]  Exhausted and behind I am I thoroughly read your iPhone 10s review. I didn't even check the verges iPhone
[01:48.540 --> 01:53.780]  Or our series for watch review. Did you write that or did somebody else Dieter did that one?
[01:53.780 --> 01:56.900]  See that's that's where I need I need like a staff. I
[01:58.060 --> 02:05.180]  Encourage everyone to find a partner like to work with it's the most rewarding working relationship
[02:05.180 --> 02:09.720]  I've ever had and so yeah, go find that guy. Don't find Dieter stay the hell away from him
[02:09.720 --> 02:17.940]  But you know for us it's a little different because we have to make videos to write so this week this week for me is
[02:20.440 --> 02:23.920]  Hey, I don't know if this happens to you after the event itself
[02:23.920 --> 02:27.700]  I have to go back and watch the video like I have to watch the live stream
[02:27.960 --> 02:34.280]  just to remember everything that happened because we're live vlogging and then we're like I saw you in the hands-on area and
[02:34.840 --> 02:38.880]  Everyone should know this John saw me taking photos in the hands-on area and he just goes I'm so happy
[02:38.880 --> 02:40.000]  I don't have to do that shit
[02:40.000 --> 02:47.160]  So like we're like in pure panic mode right at the event and we come out of it and I always have to that night
[02:47.160 --> 02:52.300]  I always sit down and watch the live stream to remember what the hell happened
[02:52.600 --> 02:56.040]  So that's like step one and then we get back, you know, we got the devices
[02:56.680 --> 02:58.520]  our video
[02:58.520 --> 03:05.440]  Was made by eight people like I counted it like 2 a.m. On Monday night, you know, we published at 6 a.m
[03:05.440 --> 03:12.360]  Tuesday there were eight people in the verge office the cranking away in this video and then hilariously on the other side of the office
[03:12.360 --> 03:16.520]  Our science team was watching the Elon Musk's. I'm gonna send artists to Mars
[03:17.800 --> 03:20.380]  So it's like a totally crazy night in the verge office
[03:21.120 --> 03:28.280]  So we we the whole verge calls it iPhone week. Yeah, right. Here's iPhone week. It's gonna happen. It's me this big thing
[03:28.840 --> 03:32.620]  We have a new executive producer. She's great. Her name is Nori. She runs her video team
[03:32.620 --> 03:37.820]  she came to one of our shoots just because she wanted to like hear what see what all the hype was about and
[03:38.140 --> 03:42.860]  Now we're like kind of good at she's like this seems pretty calm and we're like, no, this is still as crazy
[03:43.500 --> 03:49.940]  We're just good at it. But I'm I am like very lucky to work at a place where
[03:51.060 --> 03:54.640]  Like so many people are involved in the production of the thing that we do
[03:55.900 --> 04:00.700]  It's just remark every year. This is just a remarkable week for us because we
[04:00.700 --> 04:05.100]  everything that we can do we we do right we take photos doing videos we
[04:05.620 --> 04:11.980]  Do an Instagram thing we have a pot like all of the things all the tools that the verge has
[04:11.980 --> 04:16.140]  we like throw at this project and them and then I don't know if this is like for you, but
[04:16.660 --> 04:19.560]  You would think it would be over like you publish the thing
[04:20.220 --> 04:22.460]  You know throw the bomb over your shoulder and walk away
[04:23.020 --> 04:28.540]  But that's what it feels like when I hit the button you hit the button. It's like do you have that moment?
[04:28.540 --> 04:31.180]  I don't did you get the embargo? I have this one moment of
[04:31.820 --> 04:34.500]  Panic when like the thing goes up at 6 a.m
[04:34.500 --> 04:40.080]  And then you know Twitter's like a little slow so I don't see everybody else's I'm like, oh I fucked that up
[04:40.380 --> 04:44.740]  Like I got there. I'm like I go and then like the Wall Street Journal goes up or something, right?
[04:45.780 --> 04:48.420]  so I have that moment of panic, but then I have a whole day of
[04:48.940 --> 04:53.640]  People reacting and like talking to me about the review and asking questions. So that's another whole day of
[04:53.640 --> 04:58.160]  Work and like really enjoyable work like that's what you live for, right?
[04:58.160 --> 05:04.080]  I I completely agree, but it is completely why I had to pull
[05:04.480 --> 05:10.800]  Two consecutive all-nighters. So yeah, I I'm terrible at deadlines. I almost hit so
[05:11.800 --> 05:17.900]  And I and this is exactly what this podcast is for. I love this inside baseball. So the embargo dates were
[05:18.640 --> 05:21.660]  Tuesday morning 6 a.m. Eastern time
[05:21.660 --> 05:29.420]  for the iPhone 10s and then Wednesday 6 a.m. For the series for Apple watch and
[05:30.300 --> 05:31.660]  I'm
[05:31.660 --> 05:34.540]  Writing my iPhone review and it's I got it
[05:34.540 --> 05:41.420]  It's like I feel it the words are coming out of my fingers really well, but I literally was up all night and I
[05:42.380 --> 05:47.740]  Dosed the caffeine just right, you know, like I wasn't like super jittery, you know
[05:47.740 --> 05:54.420]  But I got it and I think I published at like 7 a.m. I mean it for and for me, that's really close
[05:55.180 --> 05:57.940]  Oh, no, I didn't hit at 7 a.m. Because I
[05:58.900 --> 06:04.980]  the inside story the way behind-the-scenes story is I I felt so good the night before
[06:05.620 --> 06:11.980]  About where I already was and I knew I was gonna get up at 6 whether I was gonna get any sleep or not
[06:11.980 --> 06:14.880]  I was gonna get up at 6 to publish if I was done and so
[06:14.880 --> 06:16.880]  usually
[06:17.600 --> 06:21.600]  My wife Amy takes our son to school and I said, you know what? I'll be up
[06:21.600 --> 06:25.840]  I will take him to school tomorrow. So I was like you can sleep in I got it and
[06:26.640 --> 06:30.000]  It came time to take him to school and I was in I was editing
[06:30.000 --> 06:34.040]  It was like final editing, but I wasn't done yet and I was like, oh geez
[06:34.040 --> 06:36.040]  I was like, we're gonna speed walk to school today kid
[06:36.720 --> 06:39.340]  So I took him to school. So I published around eight. That's right
[06:39.340 --> 06:41.440]  I would have probably published around seven
[06:41.440 --> 06:45.360]  But I it wound up being a little after eight because I took my son to school
[06:45.560 --> 06:52.120]  Yeah, and then I had that day of I I read your review. I read
[06:52.720 --> 06:58.800]  Joanna's I read a couple others. I read panzerino, you know it there's still some I have so many open tabs from
[06:59.280 --> 07:02.280]  Reviews to read I still want to see what other people have to say
[07:03.480 --> 07:05.480]  But I'm taking feedback
[07:05.480 --> 07:12.560]  From people all day. But meanwhile, I know that I've got this 6 a.m. Deadline the next day for the watch
[07:12.560 --> 07:17.120]  and then eventually I go to sleep and I wake up around like 6 p.m. And
[07:18.520 --> 07:22.080]  It's like I got to get going on the watch thing. But in the meantime, I'm
[07:22.960 --> 07:29.440]  Still taking feedback from the iPhone review and and again, like you said it is fantastic. It is exactly
[07:29.440 --> 07:36.800]  Why I do this it is it is it is both the hardest I work all year and by far and away the most
[07:37.000 --> 07:39.480]  Rewarding the only thing that compares is when I do my live
[07:40.480 --> 07:47.040]  Show at the WWDC in terms of being rewarding and feeling like hey, I'm okay at what I do
[07:47.360 --> 07:54.120]  Yeah, no, I'm completely with you that and and for me, it's like both positive and like I want to hear I'm
[07:54.120 --> 08:00.020]  I'm very interested in what people think I got wrong, right? Like me too. That's exactly why I have you on the show
[08:01.080 --> 08:08.480]  Because I thought I felt like our reviews were quite different in terms of the camera and that is exactly you know
[08:08.480 --> 08:12.200]  Like that is exactly I don't want you to tell me what I got right? You don't even have the phone yet
[08:12.200 --> 08:17.880]  I want to know like what I got wrong and I want to know what questions you still have that are unanswered
[08:17.920 --> 08:23.440]  You know and and that's what it's fascinating, you know, and people ask such great questions
[08:23.440 --> 08:26.940]  It's like oh that is a great question. Let me tell you and then meanwhile
[08:27.040 --> 08:31.500]  It's like 11 p.m. And I haven't really started my watch review yet, and I'm like, oh
[08:36.240 --> 08:38.240]  I've started doing this very coy thing
[08:39.120 --> 08:43.800]  Which I you know, I used to be a lawyer. So I believe it's firmly within the letter of the law. I
[08:44.560 --> 08:49.960]  Don't know if it's within the spirit of the law, but you're not supposed to tell people that you have devices under embargo, right?
[08:49.960 --> 08:54.360]  Yeah, that well, it's like the rule. All right, I'm right, right
[08:55.240 --> 09:00.360]  My doorman actually saw the max in my hand in my apartment building. He's like, that's the man. I was like shit
[09:01.480 --> 09:05.760]  You can't it's a huge phone. They can't get away with it. Um, but I've started tweeting
[09:05.760 --> 09:09.200]  What questions do you have like early in the process like the day of the event?
[09:09.840 --> 09:16.440]  Just so I know because people ask questions. I would never think of and to me that's where you like really find
[09:16.440 --> 09:22.120]  Angles in so like one of these days one of these companies they're gonna be like, dude
[09:22.440 --> 09:27.200]  You're just giving it away that you have it, but I'm like, no, but it doesn't say it's just I'm just well
[09:27.200 --> 09:31.540]  I'm just idly wondering what questions you have. So we'll see. We'll see if I get ding for that
[09:31.540 --> 09:35.000]  but to me that if what I'm doing in a review is
[09:35.640 --> 09:39.520]  Answering as many questions as possible then I'm then I'm succeeding you
[09:40.040 --> 09:42.040]  You got that. I got the
[09:42.080 --> 09:44.900]  The gold tennis the gold tennis
[09:44.900 --> 09:51.740]  Max and I got the gold series for a watch. Did you get the same ones?
[09:51.740 --> 09:58.280]  I got the gold again Dieter has the watch right but did he get the gold one? I believe so, right?
[09:58.940 --> 10:03.540]  Well, the thing about getting the gold ones is there's no way to hide that you know
[10:03.540 --> 10:07.260]  I mean like you could put it in a case and then people couldn't tell but even you know
[10:07.260 --> 10:10.980]  If you don't put it in the case, there's no way that you can use it
[10:10.980 --> 10:16.380]  so the letter of the NDA is that you're not supposed to let anybody know other than like
[10:16.520 --> 10:19.980]  people you work with and people in your immediate family, but it
[10:21.100 --> 10:25.840]  You know, I don't see how they can eaters is space gray. We got that wrong, huh?
[10:27.660 --> 10:34.300]  Well, it's still it's like how am I supposed to wear this watch and and if somebody really notices that I'm wearing the gold
[10:34.740 --> 10:38.380]  Series for a watch. I mean, I can't hide it. You can't even put the watch in a case
[10:38.380 --> 10:44.620]  If you know what you're looking for, it's it's immediately obvious that I'm wearing this gold series for a watch
[10:44.780 --> 10:49.780]  Yeah, and it's not like we don't run in circles where knows what we do, right? So
[10:50.340 --> 10:56.020]  Well, there's like a little bit of like I'm gonna trust my friends like they're gonna see this phone and they're just gonna
[10:56.300 --> 10:58.300]  Help me keep the secret. Yeah
[11:02.140 --> 11:06.280]  So I have an inside baseball question for you sir, okay in your watch review
[11:06.280 --> 11:09.360]  Yes, you say you had it before the event
[11:09.960 --> 11:12.760]  Was that no, that's true. No, that's not
[11:13.400 --> 11:17.880]  That's a mistake. If I said that what does the actual review say?
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  Says you absolutely not true. I
[11:21.680 --> 11:26.320]  Need to go find your view now. Here we go. Live live doc saying yeah
[11:27.160 --> 11:29.160]  talk-show, um, oh
[11:29.640 --> 11:31.440]  Here we go
[11:31.440 --> 11:35.700]  You wrote which brings me to the most striking new hardware in the series for the display
[11:35.700 --> 11:41.300]  I cheated a bit when I wrote the following bit and my thoughts and observations piece regarding last week's event
[11:41.380 --> 11:46.860]  Because I'd been wearing this review unit for several days already, right? That meant that all I meant by that
[11:46.860 --> 11:49.260]  I didn't mean that I'd been wearing it before the event
[11:49.260 --> 11:55.100]  I meant that I didn't publish my thoughts and observations on the event thing until Friday. It was like
[11:55.780 --> 11:57.380]  Okay
[11:57.380 --> 12:04.100]  so that's a good call that I'm maybe that sentence was a little unclear, but I absolutely I
[12:04.100 --> 12:10.900]  I have never ever gotten anything before an event. I don't I don't think anybody has I don't think even Walt
[12:10.900 --> 12:14.580]  You know if anybody would have ever gotten anything before an event, it would have been Walt
[12:14.580 --> 12:20.720]  But I don't think anybody has I'll say I did a hundred episodes of a podcast with Walt. I never got him to admit shit
[12:23.300 --> 12:28.900]  Yeah, you're way closer to him than me but I've asked him questions like that and he's very very secret
[12:29.540 --> 12:32.700]  No, Peter and I both read that line and we're like no
[12:32.700 --> 12:34.180]  I
[12:34.180 --> 12:38.060]  Know I will I will try to clarify that after this after we record
[12:38.900 --> 12:43.020]  You should own it man. Keep the ambiguity in there. It's it's your brand. I
[12:46.940 --> 12:53.460]  Have a great great story about having privilege hardware. I forget what year it was
[12:55.660 --> 12:57.660]  But it was you know, maybe around
[12:57.660 --> 13:04.260]  2013 2014 and I got ahead and there was it was an iPad event in California. Yeah
[13:05.260 --> 13:08.460]  Maybe 2012. I don't know and I'm flying on
[13:09.540 --> 13:12.060]  Southwest back home to Philly and
[13:13.060 --> 13:17.860]  Wait, I don't even know why but to me this is all the more amazing because Southwest you you
[13:18.980 --> 13:21.060]  You don't get assigned seats on the plane
[13:21.140 --> 13:25.340]  you you first were on you pick an open seat and you just sit wherever you want and
[13:25.340 --> 13:31.820]  there's a little bit of status involved where you can like pay extra to get on first so you can be more likely to get
[13:31.820 --> 13:33.660]  a good seat whatever and
[13:33.660 --> 13:36.420]  I go on and I got it to me
[13:37.140 --> 13:41.620]  One of the best seats on the plane is in the exit row. There's one of the exit row
[13:42.180 --> 13:44.180]  Sides how only has two seats?
[13:45.060 --> 13:50.740]  And I get one of those seats and it has extra room in front of you. It's like Southwest version of first class and
[13:51.340 --> 13:53.340]  I get this seat and
[13:53.340 --> 13:55.340]  then a
[13:57.020 --> 14:01.180]  Nice young woman sits next to me and I take out this new iPad
[14:02.700 --> 14:06.300]  And immediately she says to me
[14:07.700 --> 14:09.700]  Holy shit, that's the new iPad
[14:11.860 --> 14:18.340]  And I'm like, what do I do and it ends up it's it's Ashley Nelson Hornstein and she's a great speaker
[14:18.340 --> 14:20.300]  I'll put this in the show notes
[14:20.300 --> 14:25.980]  But at the time she worked for Apple. Oh, no. Yeah, she worked for Apple and
[14:26.780 --> 14:31.540]  Well, it turned out great because she worked for Apple. So she knew to keep her mouth shut and I was like, oh
[14:31.540 --> 14:32.980]  I'm John Gruber and she's like, holy shit
[14:32.980 --> 14:37.860]  You're John Gruber and we had like the most amazing like three hour long conversation like nerding out on a plane
[14:37.860 --> 14:42.700]  And in fact, she had never seen the I've she worked on something else at the time while she was at Apple
[14:42.700 --> 14:48.100]  So she hadn't seen it but because she worked at Apple. I was just totally like here take it, you know play around with
[14:48.100 --> 14:49.340]  it
[14:49.340 --> 14:55.060]  And we had like the most amazing conversation for like three hours on this flight and it was amazing
[14:55.060 --> 14:57.820]  But I had this moment of panic when she first
[14:58.660 --> 15:00.700]  Said that I was like, oh shit. What do I do?
[15:01.500 --> 15:05.320]  That's always my fear, you know, cuz we I'm sure you feel this too
[15:06.580 --> 15:11.040]  There's the event and you get the phone and then you have to go home
[15:11.220 --> 15:15.100]  Right, and I the first thing I want to do is put my SIM card in the phone, right?
[15:15.100 --> 15:19.300]  Like without quite I I want to start using this thing. I want to understand it
[15:20.060 --> 15:21.460]  but I can't
[15:21.460 --> 15:25.980]  Use it on a plane. Like I feel very nervous about it. Yeah, and I certainly
[15:26.580 --> 15:33.140]  Cannot open my laptop and write iPhone 10s review and start typing away with somebody sitting next to me
[15:33.180 --> 15:37.420]  so there's this block of you know, five and a half hours flying from
[15:38.080 --> 15:41.740]  San Francisco to New York where I'm just like playing with the thing and
[15:41.740 --> 15:45.220]  Desperately trying to remember everything that happened on like the bad Wi-Fi
[15:45.220 --> 15:48.820]  Yeah, and I'm always like, you know, I should just sleep like what am I doing?
[15:48.820 --> 15:52.420]  This is useless time, but I can never help it and I always display with it
[15:52.420 --> 15:57.860]  Yeah, so yeah, and I there was one time to I forget when what year it was
[15:57.860 --> 16:02.660]  But it was one year to where it obviously wasn't one of the s years
[16:03.980 --> 16:09.380]  Might have been like the iPhone 4. I don't know. Well, cuz I didn't get it. No, I didn't get a review
[16:09.380 --> 16:11.380]  I wasn't on the review thing
[16:11.980 --> 16:13.980]  So probably was like the iPhone 5
[16:15.580 --> 16:19.500]  And I got on the plane and I had it out and like the flight attendant was like, oh my god
[16:19.500 --> 16:21.500]  is that the new iPhone and I just was like
[16:22.100 --> 16:26.920]  Yeah, and I just like put it back in my pocket and I was like, yeah, and I was thinking like you I was like
[16:26.920 --> 16:29.980]  I guess I'll just start playing with this when I get home like
[16:30.260 --> 16:35.060]  Cuz I just I just worried that somebody you know, I mean and it I just worried that you know
[16:35.060 --> 16:40.980]  if I said yeah, and I kept it out somebody's gonna snap a picture and and put it on Instagram or something and you know,
[16:40.980 --> 16:45.220]  Like dude, this guy next to me has an iPhone 5 already and it's like I don't I don't want I don't need that
[16:45.420 --> 16:51.700]  Yeah, I got really lucky this year because the two phones were identical for most part. Yes
[16:52.500 --> 16:54.980]  so in years past I
[16:55.580 --> 17:01.380]  Land in New York and the video team and the photography team want the phone right away
[17:01.380 --> 17:05.540]  Right, like those b-roll shots don't come out of nowhere. They take hours and hours and hours
[17:05.540 --> 17:11.700]  Like if you look watch our video this year, there's all these like beautiful shots of it floating through space
[17:13.380 --> 17:15.380]  Hopefully we took some behind the scenes photos of this
[17:16.220 --> 17:18.700]  That iPhone is mounted on like a robot arm
[17:18.700 --> 17:22.640]  That's like slowly tracking through a room with the camera following it
[17:22.980 --> 17:27.420]  That took a long time to set up and like that's time. I don't get to use the phone, right?
[17:27.420 --> 17:31.460]  So this year I was like, yeah, you could take this little one like whatever will like battery test it later
[17:31.460 --> 17:32.860]  Like have at it
[17:32.860 --> 17:37.260]  Like there's there's nothing I'm gonna miss if I don't have that phone apart from the screen size
[17:37.260 --> 17:43.260]  But like I know the screen size a little one in years past it's this it's literally war
[17:43.260 --> 17:46.860]  I'm like guys I need to review the phone and they're like, yeah
[17:46.860 --> 17:50.700]  But we need to do and we have we're constantly negotiating that time
[17:51.060 --> 17:55.220]  And then I'm always worried like it's my phone like I put my SIM card in it
[17:55.220 --> 17:59.260]  I log into my I do all the things and I'm always like in the middle of one of these shots
[17:59.260 --> 18:01.260]  I'm gonna get a notification. That's like
[18:01.740 --> 18:05.140]  The verge of shutting down, you know, it's something horrible, right?
[18:06.540 --> 18:08.860]  But this year it was it was I come I
[18:09.380 --> 18:16.160]  Fully support two identical phones with different screen sizes because it made it much easier this year to get photos fundamentally
[18:16.160 --> 18:22.620]  I that is absolutely true. And I think it's one of the I think it's one of the best things about this
[18:22.620 --> 18:27.140]  cycle of iPhone and I hope they keep it going forward is that
[18:27.660 --> 18:28.900]  and I
[18:28.900 --> 18:35.420]  Emphasized it as much as I could in my review that it really is like choosing between a medium and large cup of the same
[18:35.420 --> 18:40.900]  Coffee it is, you know, you do get more battery life. There are more it's it's
[18:41.380 --> 18:43.940]  You know that the screen has the same resolution
[18:44.820 --> 18:49.580]  Pixels per inch so you do get more pixels on the larger phone, you know
[18:49.580 --> 18:55.020]  And so in terms of quote-unquote, they're the same phone but different sizes. It's not the same screen scaled up
[18:55.020 --> 18:59.060]  You do get more information, you know more pixels, which I think is the right way to do it
[18:59.060 --> 19:04.180]  But I think people fundamentally understand that and it's a to me a much easier decision
[19:04.180 --> 19:06.800]  It is do you want a bigger phone or a smaller phone and that's it?
[19:06.800 --> 19:11.800]  It's because you get literally the exact same camera and I thought that in the past three four years
[19:12.620 --> 19:13.700]  the
[19:13.700 --> 19:20.860]  The subtle camera advantages of the plus phones were very hard to make a recommendation
[19:21.420 --> 19:23.780]  regarding you know that that they've always had like
[19:25.780 --> 19:29.180]  Like optical image stabilization advantages, you know
[19:29.180 --> 19:34.940]  Like there was one year where only the plus had any optical image stabilization and then the next year
[19:35.220 --> 19:40.540]  The smaller one had it but only for stills and not for video, but the plus had it for video, you know
[19:40.540 --> 19:42.340]  There were always these subtle
[19:42.340 --> 19:46.100]  technical advantages to the plus size phone that made it really hard to make a
[19:46.500 --> 19:51.260]  Sort of recommendation other than your preference for size. Whereas this year it is just
[19:51.820 --> 19:57.380]  Two two phones that are exactly the same in two sizes, and I'm good. I gotta say I'm going back and forth
[19:58.380 --> 20:00.860]  Almost day by day on which which size I prefer
[20:01.460 --> 20:06.140]  And I've been using the max and I'm like used to it and I hold the little one. I'm like pretty small
[20:06.980 --> 20:08.500]  but I
[20:08.500 --> 20:10.540]  think to me if the max had
[20:10.540 --> 20:17.780]  Picture in picture video. Yeah, man, that would that would it would sell it would just absolutely sound like yeah, you know, I saw the
[20:18.820 --> 20:24.420]  The Jets Browns game last night like got interesting the Browns won a game. It's amazing
[20:25.540 --> 20:27.740]  Like the whole I was like, alright, I want to check this out
[20:27.740 --> 20:31.020]  so like figure it out how to watch football on a phone is like
[20:31.700 --> 20:36.340]  Impossible like the NFL app last night told me that if I was using my cell network
[20:36.340 --> 20:42.180]  I could watch it. But if I wanted to watch it on Wi-Fi, I had to log into my cable provider, which makes
[20:42.900 --> 20:47.340]  Zero fucking sense. But anyway, it's like are you on Verizon? Are you on Verizon? I'm an AT&T
[20:47.340 --> 20:53.260]  I thought Verizon had like exclusive NFL rights, but maybe yeah, the NFL took those away this year. Ah, okay
[20:53.260 --> 20:55.860]  So look watching the NFL is like super complicated
[20:55.860 --> 21:01.680]  Yeah, I here's my recommendation to everyone by like buy some TV package like whatever one you want
[21:01.680 --> 21:06.900]  know in your heart that you've spent some money on TV and then watch whatever pirated stream you want because
[21:07.320 --> 21:09.320]  They don't they won't sell it to you
[21:09.340 --> 21:13.780]  So like just morally clear your your mind and then like go forward anyway
[21:13.780 --> 21:19.660]  So I'm like, I'm like on Twitter hearing like this game is crazy. So I go and open the app
[21:19.660 --> 21:23.700]  I watch the thing and I'm like wait, I want to see what people are tweeting about. All right, so yeah
[21:23.700 --> 21:27.820]  It's like and the screen is big enough to support picture-in-picture in it
[21:27.820 --> 21:33.060]  That's like literally the one thing I want from this phone. Just do it the way the iPad does it
[21:33.060 --> 21:37.080]  Yeah, and let me watch two things at once and that then there would be no
[21:37.600 --> 21:42.940]  Literally no competition and you know, you know that technically the phone could do it without breaking a sweat
[21:42.940 --> 21:44.620]  I mean because I did
[21:44.620 --> 21:51.020]  You know if the I if the iPad can do it and the iPad is still the best iPad you can buy today still has
[21:51.020 --> 21:54.900]  The old a 10 processor. Yeah, I guess it's an a 10 X
[21:54.900 --> 22:01.340]  I don't know but it's it's you know, two generations behind the a-12 the a-12 like I use the analogy in my review that it
[22:02.300 --> 22:07.740]  Deals with things like, you know things like this like neo and in the matrix dodging bullets, you know
[22:07.740 --> 22:12.660]  It is like it is like no sweat like no sweat could this phone, you know
[22:12.660 --> 22:18.060]  This phone could probably do like three or four picture-in-picture HD streams. No problem. Yeah, I mean the
[22:19.180 --> 22:21.860]  The Apple TV can do it right if you open the ESPN app
[22:21.860 --> 22:27.500]  You can get right for HD streams going this and that that thing is nowhere near as powerful as the top, right?
[22:27.500 --> 22:30.580]  So yeah, and that's a perfect example like watching live sports
[22:30.580 --> 22:37.420]  Why you want to check up on Twitter is exactly a perfect example of why you might want picture-in-picture
[22:37.740 --> 22:41.860]  It's also why Twitter keeps trying to be a sports video provider
[22:42.340 --> 22:44.340]  It's not a good strategy for them
[22:44.340 --> 22:48.620]  But you see why they like they keep wandering towards it because they know it's a compelling use case
[22:48.620 --> 22:52.300]  But yeah, that's if if it had the picture-in-picture video
[22:52.820 --> 22:55.640]  To me, it would be absolutely no con
[22:55.640 --> 23:00.700]  You should buy the max you I've been getting 12 to 14 hours of battery life on this thing and I'm not a casual
[23:01.020 --> 23:05.740]  Right on use right. So like the advantages are big, you know, there's some size stuff like
[23:06.540 --> 23:10.860]  I put it in my review, you know the old plus funds they had those big bezels
[23:10.860 --> 23:16.540]  So to reach the top was actually not as much of a reach and now it's a really big reach for me
[23:16.540 --> 23:19.060]  So yeah, there's some like handling considerations
[23:19.060 --> 23:24.780]  But if you could if this could just be your computer in that way, it would be no contest to me. I
[23:25.820 --> 23:30.900]  Do you find and it's the weirdest thing and I touched on this in my review and then I kind of
[23:33.620 --> 23:37.000]  Because it's so nonsensical that I didn't want to go into detail on it
[23:37.000 --> 23:38.940]  But it's the weirdest thing to me
[23:38.940 --> 23:46.300]  Is that even though it if you actually look at the technical specs of like an iPhone 8 plus and the iPhone 10s max?
[23:46.700 --> 23:49.700]  The max is like ever so slightly smaller
[23:49.700 --> 23:55.660]  It is like a millimeter narrower and in terms of side to side, but it feels
[23:56.460 --> 24:01.580]  Smaller in hand like like way more than you would think from one millimeter difference
[24:01.580 --> 24:04.660]  It actually to me feels it is way closer
[24:04.660 --> 24:10.980]  This is what I wrote is that it's a way closer call for me than than ever before. I've never really used a plus full-time
[24:11.340 --> 24:14.100]  but the the 10s max feels
[24:14.900 --> 24:18.980]  Somehow feels smaller. I don't know if that's just because it doesn't have the forehead and chin
[24:18.980 --> 24:22.500]  It's like an optical illusion, but it feels better in hand. I
[24:24.020 --> 24:26.860]  Would chalk it up to option like we you know, we measure it we put them
[24:27.980 --> 24:32.220]  To me. I think it's the screen is so good that when you're holding it
[24:32.220 --> 24:37.260]  You just feel like you're you feel like what how they want you to feel which is you're holding a giant screen
[24:37.260 --> 24:41.000]  Yeah, and there's nothing around it. Yeah, and you know, it's also the same
[24:42.080 --> 24:48.140]  Basic size as the note. It's the same basic size as the pixel 2. They're all big like there's no
[24:48.940 --> 24:52.640]  Well, you know when I flip the the max over I'm like, yeah, this looks
[24:53.340 --> 24:56.980]  Virtually the same as the is the old plus phones. I think that
[24:56.980 --> 25:04.720]  Having the camera bump be vertical instead of horizontal really helps it in like a in that optical illusion way like hmm
[25:04.840 --> 25:07.960]  You know, it's like thinning. It's like a thinning. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[25:08.680 --> 25:13.000]  But yeah, it's it's I mean I have big hands. I'm like, yeah, this one's pretty big
[25:13.000 --> 25:19.320]  That's what I'm saying day by day. He'd come back and forth, but I end up I end up working on my phone
[25:19.320 --> 25:27.200]  Almost all day long like my job is sometimes I like fear that the only thing I make at the verge is meetings, you know
[25:27.200 --> 25:31.440]  I'm like so I'm like I spent and I try not to take my laptop like I want to be engaged
[25:31.440 --> 25:34.800]  I want to pay attention. I want to be like a helpful boss like that sort of dude
[25:36.120 --> 25:39.400]  and so I only take my phone so I use my phone all day long and
[25:40.560 --> 25:42.480]  to me it's like
[25:42.480 --> 25:44.880]  Yeah, I want to watch things on this thing
[25:44.880 --> 25:50.720]  I want to like see more rows of the spreadsheet or whatever like that's the argument to me is like this is the phone you
[25:50.720 --> 25:53.120]  Can work on all day. It's not the argument is less
[25:54.000 --> 25:55.240]  like
[25:55.240 --> 25:57.900]  You're gonna get a great video experience, right?
[25:57.900 --> 26:03.360]  like I'm still a purist like I want to watch videos on big screen, but the argument to me is as a
[26:03.960 --> 26:06.600]  Primary computer you want a bigger screen? Yeah, I
[26:07.240 --> 26:09.000]  bought the
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.200]  And it is such an amazing cheat to be able to have the phone
[26:14.200 --> 26:17.800]  Both phones for a couple of days before the pre-ordering goes live
[26:18.320 --> 26:22.320]  And you know, you know, we don't have to return these review units right away
[26:22.320 --> 26:27.240]  So if I didn't pre-order right at 3 a.m. Eastern when the thing goes live
[26:27.240 --> 26:31.560]  It's not like I don't have the new phone already. I already have the review unit
[26:32.840 --> 26:38.680]  But I ordered for me personally that the regular tennis I did not get the max but it was a close call
[26:38.680 --> 26:44.720]  I just I just like the smaller size better and it's yeah, it's a good fit for my eyes
[26:46.640 --> 26:51.900]  But it is a way it's it in so many ways it's such a tougher call than any previous year
[26:52.200 --> 26:57.880]  Yeah, I mean I talked one of my friends into a max and I talked another one of my friends out of a max
[26:59.080 --> 27:05.520]  And the arguments were exactly the same right? Like I was like, it's really big but the battery is pretty good
[27:05.520 --> 27:11.040]  But it's really big and one friend was like wow, man gotta get the max then and the other friend was like, ah, it's huge
[27:11.880 --> 27:14.680]  It was was the same. So I think that's good
[27:14.680 --> 27:20.800]  I agree with you that the the difference on the plus camera was never enough to sell the size, right?
[27:21.000 --> 27:26.720]  It was tempting open and it was always an irritant like like like a piece of sand caught in my eye
[27:26.720 --> 27:30.880]  You know, I mean like that. I knew that I was getting a slightly lesser camera
[27:30.880 --> 27:34.160]  But it wasn't enough to motivate me to do it. Do you take a lot of video on your phone?
[27:34.160 --> 27:40.660]  I don't but I'm I'm trying to now and and it I realized that I've been
[27:41.360 --> 27:43.360]  for some
[27:44.440 --> 27:50.000]  Inexplicable reasons stingy about shooting video on like family vacations, etc
[27:50.000 --> 27:55.800]  You know the just the typical things that you do not not like work-related not stuff. I meant to mean to show but that
[27:57.760 --> 27:59.760]  And it's funny because
[28:00.440 --> 28:02.440]  like so my son is
[28:02.440 --> 28:08.660]  14 he's in ninth grade and in the early years of his life. It was sort of the
[28:09.240 --> 28:15.940]  The flip era, you know where we had like these these little dedicated video cameras that were so small
[28:15.940 --> 28:23.280]  and I shot more video then because I had a flip than I do now with an iPhone even though the iPhone is like
[28:23.920 --> 28:29.240]  Ten times a hundred times better technically. Yeah, and it there's a certain aspect of me
[28:29.240 --> 28:36.720]  That's stingy about shooting video. And and so like last year I had the 200 I bought the 256 gigabyte iPhone 10
[28:36.720 --> 28:43.180]  And I checked before ordering like hey, which one should I buy 256 or 512 and my phone was only at like?
[28:44.300 --> 28:47.520]  140 150 gigabytes, so I had tons of space left
[28:48.560 --> 28:51.680]  It's not like it's not like I'm running out of space and can't shoot the video
[28:53.600 --> 28:57.400]  But so I'm trying to I'm trying to shoot more video but I don't shoot a lot
[28:57.400 --> 29:01.760]  And there's like a part of me that is like trained to think hey video will suck up all your storage
[29:02.240 --> 29:05.360]  It's I don't you so I'm with you. I don't shoot nearly enough. I
[29:06.360 --> 29:10.300]  I'm not worried about storage. That's I can't figure it out. And so
[29:10.920 --> 29:14.840]  My kid is five months old. Her name is max, by the way, I'm
[29:15.400 --> 29:17.400]  Literally never gonna forget Apple for this
[29:18.680 --> 29:20.920]  And what I've noticed is
[29:20.920 --> 29:27.000]  My instincts are photography. I take photos of her. I edit photos and I take
[29:27.640 --> 29:30.280]  Hundreds of photos like if I was worried about storage
[29:30.280 --> 29:36.460]  I would be screwing myself because I can't stop taking photos of her. Yeah, and my wife takes videos of her
[29:36.460 --> 29:41.920]  Yeah, she has an iPhone 10 and my and I just like it never really clicked that we think differently
[29:41.920 --> 29:47.220]  Yeah, and now I realized my wife takes video by default. That's actually the first thing she goes to do
[29:47.220 --> 29:50.900]  so like we were on vacation and like she turns on her
[29:51.460 --> 29:55.100]  Camera and like takes a long video of wherever we are and like sends it to her mom
[29:55.180 --> 29:58.460]  Yeah, and like and I'm like I watch I'm like, why would you do that?
[29:58.940 --> 30:02.540]  But you know, it's like a difference in preference, but it's amazing to me that
[30:03.580 --> 30:09.980]  some some people's default is I'm gonna shoot video and then I look back I'm like, you know the
[30:11.020 --> 30:16.620]  Gigabytes of media we've collected of this small human being and I love the photos I've taken I'm like
[30:16.620 --> 30:21.380]  Oh, I should take way more video. And the only thing that bridges the gap is like they're all live photos
[30:21.380 --> 30:22.940]  Yeah, so I get a little bit of it
[30:22.940 --> 30:29.700]  But I'm like, I'm actively trying to train myself to take more video. I am exactly the same as a better
[30:29.700 --> 30:36.340]  I'm exactly in the same boat and the difference to me is that when when Jonas when my son was five months old
[30:36.340 --> 30:39.860]  I had this flip camera that only took video, right?
[30:39.860 --> 30:44.440]  Yeah, and so there was nothing else to do other than to take video
[30:44.440 --> 30:49.540]  And so that's why I had more video and I'm exactly like you I have I still take every week
[30:49.540 --> 30:51.980]  I take tons and tons of still photos
[30:51.980 --> 30:59.220]  but my instincts always are to take still photos not video and and the other thing I do and maybe it sounds to me like
[30:59.220 --> 31:02.460]  You and I think exactly like is when I do take video. I'm I
[31:02.980 --> 31:05.380]  There the clips are way too short. Yes
[31:06.380 --> 31:09.900]  It's like I'm holding my breath and it's like as long as I can hold my breath
[31:09.900 --> 31:14.420]  That's how long the clip is. Whereas I think my wife is the same way if my wife takes a video
[31:14.420 --> 31:18.540]  She just lets it run which is the way you suppose you should shoot video. You just let it run
[31:18.540 --> 31:22.980]  You know get lots of b-roll dude. I work with video professionals. I should know this
[31:24.820 --> 31:27.300]  Yet all my video clips like ten seconds
[31:28.100 --> 31:30.820]  Mine are all nine ten or eleven seconds long
[31:30.820 --> 31:35.500]  I'm like wants to watch this and I'm like, you know, my mom can't consume enough video of the kid
[31:35.500 --> 31:37.500]  Yeah, so Becky's sending her like
[31:38.060 --> 31:39.140]  15-minute
[31:39.140 --> 31:43.900]  Adventures. I'm like, what are we doing? It's any of iCloud. It all goes whatever
[31:43.900 --> 31:49.560]  It's I'm I'm trying to be better and I'm gonna get there. I hope you and I can go on this journey together
[31:49.700 --> 31:53.500]  You know, it's interesting is um, I know a bunch of like youtubers
[31:53.940 --> 31:58.580]  Yes, and one of the questions I got which it's really hard for me to
[31:59.300 --> 32:04.580]  Figure out the answer to is the stabilization the video stabilization the iPhone does
[32:04.580 --> 32:11.560]  Often competes with the gimbals like that. Yes. Yes, right and that to me is like
[32:12.260 --> 32:16.900]  You know, my my favorite thing about covering technology and like what the verge does in particular
[32:17.460 --> 32:22.380]  And I think you actually wrote this line today about the democratization of image capture
[32:23.420 --> 32:26.260]  That is to me. That's the heart of the verge right like that
[32:26.940 --> 32:31.920]  We make tools people use the tools tools great culture next generation of tools reflects that culture
[32:31.920 --> 32:38.480]  And it's so interesting to me that we are now at the place where teenagers are asking me about
[32:39.040 --> 32:45.980]  Image stabilization inside of like the world's most advanced smartphone camera because it's competing with their incredibly advanced gimbal
[32:45.980 --> 32:48.880]  And there you can see it in some of these videos. It's
[32:49.400 --> 32:52.680]  Like I'm not enough an expert to like really explain it to people
[32:52.680 --> 32:59.280]  But basically the gimbal tries to stabilize the camera by moving it ever so slightly and that competes with the cameras inbuilt
[32:59.280 --> 33:04.980]  stabilization and so the video jitters that's like is Apple gonna is Apple gonna
[33:05.660 --> 33:11.020]  Implement that setting right like that's a for Apple like a philosophical kind of question
[33:11.020 --> 33:17.940]  Like are you gonna enable people to turn off some of your features that helps most of the world because youtubers exist
[33:17.940 --> 33:26.060]  Yeah, and I honestly don't I couldn't answer that question at all. I actually spoke to someone at Apple and and the iPhone 10s is
[33:26.060 --> 33:33.180]  They actually did take that into consideration and while there's no setting it is it should be better
[33:33.860 --> 33:38.260]  That that the 10 in particular really had some problems
[33:39.020 --> 33:43.140]  exactly what you said when you put it on the gimbal and the gimbal is supposed to do the you know, the
[33:43.820 --> 33:45.500]  steady cam style
[33:45.500 --> 33:50.900]  Stabilization the 10s is supposedly better, you know, it's specifically for that use case
[33:50.900 --> 33:56.740]  I don't know though that it's ideal and they don't have a setting to actually just turn it off and let the gimbal do all
[33:56.740 --> 34:02.980]  The stabilization but yeah, it's a perfect example of a deep philosophical question for Apple
[34:03.420 --> 34:06.100]  but it's also I think a perfect example of
[34:07.100 --> 34:09.460]  just like the world we live in now where
[34:10.140 --> 34:17.500]  you know when whoever is designing the image sensor in the software stack you would never imagine them having to solve the problem of
[34:17.500 --> 34:22.860]  Thousands hundreds of thousands of people are gonna mount our phone on a gimbal
[34:22.860 --> 34:27.060]  Yeah, and that will not only just to make video but because that is their career
[34:27.060 --> 34:30.840]  Yeah, right and like I love that that that's like the thing
[34:31.340 --> 34:38.100]  That's what makes like writing about texting for me is it's it's an emergent behavior. It's a new kind of problem
[34:38.500 --> 34:42.820]  It's all happening in a loop. Like that's the stuff that makes me the most excited. All right
[34:42.820 --> 34:48.780]  Let me take a break here and thank our my first sponsor. It's a hello pillow. H u l l o
[34:49.060 --> 34:56.780]  Have you ever tried a buckwheat pillow? Probably not if you don't have a hello pillow already, but they're totally different than the fluffy
[34:57.580 --> 35:02.220]  Soft pillows that most of us are used to it's very similar to a beanbag
[35:02.580 --> 35:08.580]  Which if you if if you're only thinking about traditional bed pillows, you're gonna think well, that's weird
[35:08.580 --> 35:13.580]  I don't want to sleep on a beanbag, but it's really really great. It supports your head and neck
[35:14.620 --> 35:19.540]  Exactly the way you want to and unlike traditional pillows which collapse under the weight of your head
[35:20.820 --> 35:22.500]  hello
[35:22.500 --> 35:28.160]  Shapes to the shape of your head. It is a very different experience and it buckwheat fill
[35:28.620 --> 35:31.280]  Helps the pillow stay cool and dry
[35:32.220 --> 35:37.340]  All night long so you never have to do the thing like you wake up at like 4 in the morning and you flip your
[35:37.340 --> 35:40.900]  Pillow over because your pillows all hot you never have to do that with a hello pillow
[35:42.940 --> 35:47.020]  It's really a totally different experience and I've we've had them for years
[35:48.260 --> 35:50.780]  My wife can barely sleep without one
[35:50.780 --> 35:57.340]  I she's on the fence of like literally taking it with her when we travel like that is how much she loves it
[35:57.340 --> 36:01.420]  I like it. It is really great and it's so different
[36:01.420 --> 36:08.620]  The other thing too is with a hello pillow like if you're like a two pillow sleeper like with a hello pillow
[36:08.620 --> 36:11.740]  You don't need to do that anymore because it has the same effect
[36:11.740 --> 36:16.360]  Just sort of built in to sort of prop your head up a little bit. It really is amazing
[36:16.980 --> 36:18.980]  it is totally different and
[36:19.460 --> 36:24.820]  They just have it's just it's just really high quality. It's you can open it up
[36:24.820 --> 36:28.260]  You can zip it and you can put take some of it out
[36:28.260 --> 36:31.500]  If it if you feel like it's a little bit too big you just take it out. It's just like a
[36:31.820 --> 36:36.900]  You just take some of the buckwheat out. You can put more in whatever you want to do
[36:36.900 --> 36:41.700]  It's very very easy to adjust if you want a little bit bigger a little bit smaller
[36:42.700 --> 36:44.060]  and
[36:44.060 --> 36:48.200]  Here's the thing. It's very very different from what we're used to here in North America
[36:48.200 --> 36:52.420]  But people have been sleeping on buckwheat pillows for centuries. They've been using Japan
[36:52.940 --> 36:57.060]  Extensively and remain extremely popular there to do to to this day
[36:57.060 --> 37:03.660]  And so it's it's just sort of like bringing something that they've used in Japan and in Asia over here
[37:04.620 --> 37:07.940]  It's really just great now just like everything else
[37:08.620 --> 37:11.120]  You can't try it. It's an internet pillow, right?
[37:11.120 --> 37:13.660]  So you can't like sit there and try it before you buy it
[37:13.660 --> 37:14.540]  You have to buy it first
[37:14.540 --> 37:18.260]  But they know that so you can sleep on it for up to 60 nights
[37:18.260 --> 37:23.180]  And if it's not for you, you just send it back and I'll give you a full refund. No questions asked
[37:23.180 --> 37:28.580]  It's so you you can't lose. So if you're vaguely curious about it, just buy it. Try it
[37:28.700 --> 37:33.540]  You don't like it send it back you get your money back. So here's where you here's what you do to get one
[37:33.540 --> 37:35.700]  Go to hello pillow. It's you. L o o
[37:36.940 --> 37:38.940]  pillow comm
[37:39.120 --> 37:40.820]  talk-show and
[37:40.820 --> 37:44.700]  If you try more than one pillow if you get two or more
[37:44.820 --> 37:49.140]  You'll get a discount of up to 20 bucks per pillow depending on the size you buy
[37:49.140 --> 37:56.340]  Fast free shipping on every order and 1% of all of their profits are donated to the Nature Conservancy
[37:57.140 --> 37:59.140]  So go to hello pillow comm
[37:59.540 --> 38:05.100]  talk-show remember that code talk show when you check out and if you get more than one you'll save up to up to
[38:05.180 --> 38:09.340]  20 bucks per pillow my thanks to hello for sponsoring the show
[38:09.340 --> 38:17.100]  Hello, hello, what a great name. I love that. I love that. It's good. Um, all
[38:19.780 --> 38:25.340]  Right, let's talk about this this camera because we're not gonna make people wait an hour
[38:25.340 --> 38:28.460]  No, let's not make them wait an hour. We've only made him wait 40 minutes. I
[38:30.740 --> 38:35.820]  And and I'll tell you what I have a pixel but I have the pixel one I
[38:35.820 --> 38:39.660]  I'm on like an every other year and I want to get the pixel three
[38:39.660 --> 38:42.380]  I'm looking forward to it, but I skipped the pixel two
[38:42.380 --> 38:48.260]  But I feel like I'm on the wrong schedule because I feel like in hindsight the pixel two is clearly
[38:49.340 --> 38:56.360]  Way more interesting than the pixel one was it especially in terms of the camera? Yes, absolutely agreed
[38:57.420 --> 39:03.460]  You know pixel one did a lot of the same tricks. It was just a less inspired device and I feel like
[39:03.460 --> 39:05.460]  Google
[39:05.980 --> 39:09.020]  Google really understood what they wanted to do with the pixel to you and they did it
[39:10.220 --> 39:12.220]  No one bought it like
[39:12.340 --> 39:14.620]  You know, my review is like the pixel two is better
[39:15.380 --> 39:22.740]  It's like the hard caveat is the real competition is the galaxy s9, right? Like that is Apple's truest competitor and
[39:24.340 --> 39:28.740]  Some people buy the pixel I think for the verge audience
[39:28.740 --> 39:34.140]  They know the pixel exists a lot of them have it. So it's the one we address
[39:34.700 --> 39:36.700]  But it's funny to me
[39:36.700 --> 39:42.980]  Google has done all of this work to make such a compelling device and they just can't seem to turn the corner with it
[39:43.140 --> 39:50.980]  Yeah, that's to me is is and you're right that the verge audience in particular probably has the highest concentration of
[39:50.980 --> 39:58.380]  Pixel awareness. Oh, I got the stats. We have the highest concentration of pixel ownership. I think probably yeah
[39:58.700 --> 40:03.940]  I'm not surprised and it is a great phone and I've described it as an
[40:05.220 --> 40:10.900]  iPhone style phone for people who want to use Android and are
[40:11.620 --> 40:18.100]  primarily interested in Google's services, you know the integration of things like Google photos and
[40:18.100 --> 40:22.660]  You know just everything that Google does if you're in the Google ecosystem for
[40:23.260 --> 40:28.620]  Gmail and and Google photos and everything else that they do, you know calendar and and everything else
[40:29.300 --> 40:33.340]  And I don't even mean that to imply that it's a copy of the iPhone
[40:33.340 --> 40:38.820]  I just feel like it's it's just very obviously an iPhone style phone
[40:39.860 --> 40:41.860]  in a way that
[40:41.860 --> 40:48.740]  It you know that that most Android phones aren't to me most Android phones are Samsung style phones
[40:49.140 --> 40:54.540]  Mm-hmm, you know and and with in terms of just the way just the way that they deal with the displays
[40:54.540 --> 40:58.460]  You know that these displays on you know, if you spend a lot of money on any of these phones
[40:58.460 --> 41:05.460]  You're getting a great display, but the Android ones sort of I don't know Vegas it up. You know, it's it's
[41:06.180 --> 41:08.180]  Right. Yeah
[41:08.180 --> 41:13.940]  If you ever use a Samsung phone for any period of time there's if you're like a
[41:14.860 --> 41:22.060]  Huge nerd there is something extremely delightful about the fact that it just supports everything
[41:22.860 --> 41:29.340]  If you're like, oh, I've encountered an LCD monitor in the wild like I'll just plug my phone into it and it becomes like a computer
[41:30.060 --> 41:35.020]  Right or like, you know, I have this like LG OLED TV and it has some insane
[41:35.020 --> 41:42.420]  The screen mirroring standard and the s9 just like supports it like there's something great about that
[41:42.420 --> 41:48.420]  Right, like it just does everything does it do everything? Well, does that stuff work consistently?
[41:49.140 --> 41:54.980]  No, but is it enormously fun to tinker with like yes, like if you're if you're that kind of person
[41:55.300 --> 41:57.940]  It just rewards you for being like well
[41:57.940 --> 42:02.380]  What the hell else can this thing do and the answer is like honestly, whatever you want, right?
[42:02.380 --> 42:05.220]  like so I appreciate that I think you know Samsung
[42:05.900 --> 42:07.900]  they're trying to have a
[42:08.420 --> 42:14.340]  Identity as a software maker that identity is hopelessly confused where I would go with you is
[42:16.300 --> 42:19.540]  The pixel is spiritually like the the iPhone
[42:19.540 --> 42:19.940]  Yes
[42:19.940 --> 42:26.980]  And I think people listening this podcast would like understand that like it it's what Google wants. It's Google's vision of the phone
[42:26.980 --> 42:32.820]  It's integrated. There's no rough edges or or loose ends. Like it's an integrated device
[42:32.820 --> 42:36.020]  They built to their specifications to run their software
[42:36.020 --> 42:43.140]  But it just in terms of the display and and the camera, you know, which are in some ways different
[42:43.140 --> 42:49.340]  But you know you often look at your photos and videos that you shoot with the camera on the display of the device itself
[42:49.380 --> 42:55.300]  but just the amount of processing and amount of sort of punching up and the amount of you know, like you and I were talking
[42:55.300 --> 43:00.060]  Behind the scenes before we published our reviews about the amount of smoothing that's done. Yeah
[43:00.500 --> 43:05.700]  the the pixel again spiritually is along the lines of the iPhone where it's trying to be
[43:08.660 --> 43:12.300]  Natural whereas the Samsung style which a lot of amps
[43:13.020 --> 43:20.340]  Other Android phones sort of follow is sort of to you know, just punch here just punch here than reality, you know, yeah
[43:21.300 --> 43:23.300]  you know I
[43:23.300 --> 43:25.820]  So here's my I said this to you
[43:25.820 --> 43:29.060]  This is a conspiracy theory that I have and I've thought about it a lot
[43:29.060 --> 43:35.060]  And so it's a little bit more refined than the version. I told you sort of behind the scenes, right? I
[43:36.700 --> 43:40.460]  Think people prefer Samsung photos and a lot of a lot of cases
[43:41.460 --> 43:44.640]  Because they're looking at them on small screens. Yeah, they're not
[43:45.660 --> 43:47.660]  They're not looking at them with a high degree of scrutiny
[43:48.260 --> 43:52.460]  They're just looking at them on their smartphone screen and it particularly really on a Samsung smartphone screen
[43:52.460 --> 43:58.660]  you are rewarded by punchy colors and you know, like they make those look great and
[43:59.780 --> 44:06.460]  If you take a photo of yourself or your friend and the camera just happens to smooth out any imperfection in your skin on your face
[44:07.340 --> 44:09.340]  Like are you unhappy?
[44:09.500 --> 44:15.780]  No, but you know, I mean like right so there's like I think there's a huge break between
[44:15.780 --> 44:22.940]  being accurate and what people prefer and I think Samsung has sold out completely on
[44:23.380 --> 44:27.300]  Let's make what people prefer we and Samsung is a TV maker, right?
[44:27.300 --> 44:31.540]  Like they put the TVs and Best Buy and they crank the brightness all the way up and they sell a shitload of TVs
[44:31.540 --> 44:36.780]  So like what are their phones look like their phones are cranked up super punchy super saturated
[44:37.380 --> 44:39.940]  They're phantasmagoric in colors
[44:39.940 --> 44:45.900]  And what are their photos look like that? The colors are really bright. The skin tones are all smoothed out
[44:46.180 --> 44:50.760]  so I think you can sell out and make things people prefer and I
[44:51.700 --> 44:54.780]  Their photos like in the end. That's a valid right like
[44:55.420 --> 44:58.800]  Great make the thing people like yeah, it's it's all subjective in the end
[44:59.100 --> 45:03.860]  But I think Apple and Google are there they want to be honest brokers of photography
[45:03.860 --> 45:09.100]  they want to say this is true and if you want to go into Photoshop or Lightroom or whatever and
[45:09.100 --> 45:14.980]  Edit this photo you can get to where Samsung is but we're gonna start you at reality, right?
[45:14.980 --> 45:17.340]  and I I just think that pull of
[45:19.060 --> 45:23.220]  Instagram and Facebook and social sharing people are never gonna edit their photos
[45:23.220 --> 45:26.340]  So there's this poll to say well, we'll just pre-edit them for you
[45:26.340 --> 45:31.460]  And when people see the photo on Instagram, they'll say what camera is that and you'll say it s9 and be beautiful
[45:31.460 --> 45:35.540]  I don't think I should get an s92 and like I think that cycle is playing out a little bit
[45:35.540 --> 45:39.540]  I don't know that anyone will ever do as much as Samsung does but I
[45:40.100 --> 45:42.460]  Just kind of feel it. So that's like my conspiracy theory
[45:42.460 --> 45:46.300]  It's like Apple's feeling that pull Google's feeling that pull a little bit to
[45:47.020 --> 45:51.940]  Make the photos better for sharing because they know people aren't gonna edit and they're only in the same on small screens
[45:51.980 --> 45:54.860]  Yeah, I I see that and again
[45:54.860 --> 45:58.340]  I I err on the Apple slash Google side of things
[45:58.340 --> 46:02.980]  Like I want my I want my photos to be more natural and if I want to punch them up
[46:02.980 --> 46:08.540]  I'll punch them up, but I'm not even I well I am passing judgment, but I'm not saying it is
[46:08.580 --> 46:13.300]  I'm not saying it is like bad on one side good on the other it is
[46:13.900 --> 46:21.340]  two versions of good and and I and I think you're right that there definitely are some people and I think the big difference is
[46:23.260 --> 46:27.900]  It is taking into account the the knowledge that people
[46:27.900 --> 46:34.700]  Look at most of their photos only on the phone itself. They'll keep it. They'll feel like I love this photo. This is great
[46:34.700 --> 46:37.300]  I'm gonna heart it. I'm gonna send it. I'm gonna post it to
[46:38.080 --> 46:40.080]  Instagram or share it on Facebook or whatever
[46:40.380 --> 46:42.980]  But it's it's all on the phone
[46:42.980 --> 46:48.340]  no, and even the people they share it with are most likely to only look at it on the phone and
[46:48.660 --> 46:54.500]  That's different when you've got all of these megapixels and it could be so big and still look good
[46:54.500 --> 47:00.900]  But you're only looking at it, you know, and and even on a 6.5 inch diagonal, you know iPhone
[47:01.420 --> 47:05.100]  10s max it that's still very very small for a photograph
[47:06.500 --> 47:10.060]  Yeah, and I think that that that's the reality right now
[47:10.260 --> 47:15.380]  I'm with you like again, my instinct is to take photos and to be very critical of photos and
[47:16.260 --> 47:22.540]  One of the best things I invested in the last year after the kid was born. I signed up for Lightroom CC
[47:22.540 --> 47:28.180]  Which to me has it's taken the place of what the old iPhoto used to do for me in a digital camera
[47:28.340 --> 47:34.180]  Hmm, right. So like now I have a bunch of cameras like real cameras. I take a million photos that go into Lightroom
[47:35.020 --> 47:41.020]  And it it feels I have that feeling of when I first got iPhoto and I had a digital camera where I was like
[47:41.180 --> 47:43.980]  Yeah, I want to like monkey with photos all day long
[47:44.580 --> 47:49.220]  Photos on the Mac the Apple photos on the Mac does not make me feel that way. Yeah at all, right
[47:49.220 --> 47:53.260]  It's like this is kind of messy and slow and weird Lightroom is great. It sinks everywhere
[47:53.500 --> 48:00.220]  so I I'm that guy right like I want to go play with my photos and edit my photos and think about my photos and
[48:00.900 --> 48:04.380]  Look at them on my 27 inch Mac and like print a book out of them and do all that stuff
[48:05.100 --> 48:09.580]  But I don't I don't think most people are that person and so I try to keep that in mind
[48:10.460 --> 48:13.940]  Is you like examine the phone? I will say this I
[48:13.940 --> 48:18.380]  and I actually mean to write about this on during fireball not just talk about it on the
[48:18.620 --> 48:25.900]  On the podcast because it's so good and and I'm with you on that like for editing photos and manipulating them photos
[48:26.300 --> 48:28.140]  It doesn't really do it for me
[48:28.140 --> 48:33.180]  But and I used to be a Lightroom guy and I still have it but I haven't used it in a while
[48:33.180 --> 48:36.900]  Like I love Lightroom. I think I think Lightroom is is
[48:37.540 --> 48:41.960]  Arguably the best thing Adobe has ever done. I think it's a fantastic app. I love it
[48:41.960 --> 48:43.280]  but
[48:43.280 --> 48:50.040]  I've kind of got sucked into photos in just just for the simplicity of the sinking and I yeah
[48:50.040 --> 48:52.040]  I want to say this that
[48:52.160 --> 48:58.480]  For all of the knocks that Apple has gotten over the years for being quote unquote bad at services. I've I've
[48:58.960 --> 49:02.660]  photos I cloud photo syncing has gotten
[49:03.520 --> 49:04.780]  phenomenally good
[49:04.780 --> 49:08.320]  Like and and I noticed it this week in particular
[49:08.320 --> 49:12.120]  because I'm shooting photos with the
[49:12.680 --> 49:17.140]  Two new phones at least at first just to dump, you know, see very, you know
[49:17.160 --> 49:20.840]  To do the verification of are these cameras really exactly the same
[49:21.760 --> 49:22.880]  and
[49:22.880 --> 49:29.320]  I quickly determined. Yes, everything Apple says about these two cameras these two phones having the same camera is definitely true
[49:30.360 --> 49:33.040]  But even so I shot tons and tons of side-by-side
[49:33.040 --> 49:39.240]  photos with the iPhone XS and my old iPhone X to see what the year-over-year difference is and
[49:39.880 --> 49:44.520]  then I'd want to look at them on one of my Macs to see them big and
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.440]  The syncing it has gotten so good
[49:47.440 --> 49:54.640]  it is absolutely ridiculous including and I really want to thank Apple for this is and and that they've really
[49:55.040 --> 49:57.040]  improved the
[49:57.040 --> 50:03.940]  The sort of status message when you go to the photos tab like on your phone and it tells you like, okay
[50:03.940 --> 50:08.080]  you've got 20 photos that are waiting to upload but
[50:09.440 --> 50:11.520]  It's paused to save battery life
[50:11.520 --> 50:17.200]  Would you like to unpause and you can hit the button but like in terms of telling you exactly where you are?
[50:18.320 --> 50:24.960]  You know like this device is 20 photos behind has 20 new photos that haven't been uploaded yet. It is exactly right
[50:24.960 --> 50:27.200]  Whereas when when the iCloud photo?
[50:28.040 --> 50:30.040]  thing first shipped it
[50:30.800 --> 50:37.040]  It was indeterminate and and you'd look at one like if you had two phones side-by-side one would say I had like, you know
[50:38.800 --> 50:41.720]  18,000 537 photos and videos and the other one would say you have
[50:43.320 --> 50:48.600]  18,000 541 and it's like well, why are they not the same? Why what are the four photos?
[50:48.600 --> 50:52.640]  There's four and and it's like you'd look and they're not the most recent ones and it's like oh my god
[50:52.640 --> 50:56.160]  What the hell is missing? How can I make one catch up to the other?
[50:56.960 --> 51:03.560]  Not only is it way more in sync in terms of having the exact same number of photos and videos and telling you exactly how
[51:03.560 --> 51:09.320]  Number when they're not in sync it tells you and I just want to whoever at Apple has been working on that
[51:09.320 --> 51:14.820]  I want to say thank you because it it it made this week way way easier for me
[51:14.920 --> 51:20.540]  You know, it's funny because that's such a concession to the reality of like wireless networks
[51:20.540 --> 51:23.640]  Like, you know when they design it, they're like, no one should ever know
[51:23.960 --> 51:28.320]  It'll just be perfect. And then the reality is like it's never gonna be perfect
[51:28.320 --> 51:31.720]  You should tell people and they're like, you know on a whiteboard somewhere
[51:31.720 --> 51:35.040]  They're like, okay when the 5g iPhone comes out and the networking is perfect
[51:35.040 --> 51:37.820]  We're gonna take this indicator away because then it'll be perfect
[51:39.320 --> 51:44.200]  So we should talk about the actual camera because I you and I have like slightly different takes on it
[51:44.840 --> 51:50.120]  Well, hold on a second. Let me let me let me drop in another sponsor read because that's a great it's a great point
[51:50.120 --> 51:55.240]  We're gonna talk about camera right after this, but let me tell you about this great company trace Pontus
[51:56.160 --> 51:58.160]  trace Pontus is
[51:58.640 --> 52:02.640]  They sell freshly roasted gourmet coffee and it's shipped directly to you
[52:02.640 --> 52:07.640]  And one of the great things about this coffee is it's it's single origin
[52:07.640 --> 52:11.320]  That's you know, you've heard of that before but it's really just one level higher
[52:11.320 --> 52:16.360]  it is actually from a single-family farm this the this family has been selling and
[52:16.360 --> 52:21.500]  and growing coffee for like generations, but until recently
[52:22.220 --> 52:28.240]  They have only been selling it within Brazil where they make it and they've only recently started selling it around the world
[52:29.260 --> 52:35.180]  It's from the race family farm in in the town of trace Pontus in
[52:35.820 --> 52:39.060]  Brazil that's why they call it trace Pontus coffee. And here's the deal
[52:39.060 --> 52:44.860]  You don't have to choose between like a gazillion different kinds of coffee. They just sell one bean
[52:44.860 --> 52:50.740]  It is the same bean they grow it all over the farm and all you have to choose is your roast profile
[52:50.900 --> 52:55.300]  Light roast medium roast dark roast and French roast now me
[52:55.300 --> 53:01.860]  I'm not a dark or French roast or I'm French roast is effectively like extra dark that that's I've never preferred that
[53:02.500 --> 53:07.940]  I like the medium and and I'm always on the fence because I I've got this subscription
[53:07.940 --> 53:11.240]  I get the light too. Sometimes I like the light. I like the medium
[53:11.240 --> 53:17.020]  I'm on the fence between those two but you can try all of them you can get just by all four and see which one
[53:17.020 --> 53:19.660]  You like best or if you know that you don't like extra dark
[53:19.660 --> 53:24.260]  Don't even bother with the French or if you know, you like dark roast, you know get the dark in the French
[53:24.260 --> 53:26.260]  It is really great coffee
[53:27.180 --> 53:35.780]  and it is so fresh that is the thing is and I emphasize this every time I do the sponsor read for trace Pontus that
[53:35.780 --> 53:41.660]  Coffee is like a perishable item. It's not quite as sensitive as like a you know
[53:41.660 --> 53:44.460]  Like a piece of fruit or something like that, but it's close
[53:44.460 --> 53:51.620]  It is like that like roasted coffee goes bad quickly where a bad quote unquote bad isn't like awful
[53:51.620 --> 53:55.580]  It's not ruined if you've got like, you know, six-week-old coffee
[53:55.580 --> 53:57.460]  It's not like you know, it's undrinkable
[53:57.460 --> 54:02.400]  But it really makes a difference when it's fresh and here's the deal trace Pontus when you order it
[54:02.400 --> 54:08.920]  They ship it themselves. They don't put their coffee in like a warehouse and then you order it and then the stuff
[54:08.920 --> 54:13.380]  That's been sitting on the shelves forever get shipped to you. They are shipping you coffee. That has
[54:13.920 --> 54:16.720]  Just been roasted and then they ship it right to you
[54:17.760 --> 54:23.880]  It's really good stuff. I keep getting feedback from readers on Twitter and stuff like that. They're like, hey, I've signed up
[54:23.880 --> 54:27.400]  I got this trace Pontus really really good coffee. It's really really good
[54:28.800 --> 54:31.120]  So here's the deal you can go to trace Pontus
[54:31.120 --> 54:32.560]  com
[54:32.560 --> 54:39.760]  TR e s p o n t a s dot-com slash coffee and you can find out more about their coffee
[54:39.760 --> 54:41.760]  And you can order it from them right there
[54:42.120 --> 54:47.480]  Or you can just go to Amazon and search for trace Pontus and you can buy it from Amazon
[54:47.800 --> 54:53.200]  They encourage you to do it. They love it when you buy from Amazon, but when you buy from Amazon, it's just the storefront
[54:53.200 --> 54:55.080]  It still ships from trace Pontus
[54:55.080 --> 54:59.320]  It's not coming from like an Amazon warehouse where the coffee is sitting on the shelves for weeks and weeks
[54:59.320 --> 55:02.760]  So do that to try it see if you like it
[55:02.760 --> 55:08.280]  And if you do then you can sign up for a coffee subscription and you can get fresh free fresh beans
[55:08.840 --> 55:13.120]  Sent to you on a regular schedule up to you. Do you want it every week?
[55:13.120 --> 55:16.020]  You want it every two weeks you want it every four weeks. It's your choice
[55:16.280 --> 55:21.100]  But then you don't even have to worry you never have to do anything and it's just you know, ding-dong, you know
[55:21.120 --> 55:24.880]  There's there's your coffee and you never have to shop for coffee again
[55:24.880 --> 55:28.360]  You just always have fresh coffee in the house or in your office or wherever you want to buy it

[55:50.040 --> 55:57.520]  Using this code. So enter that code at checkout the talk show at trace Pontos comm slash coffee and
[55:58.600 --> 56:01.360]  You'll save a lot of money and it's good coffee. So
[56:02.280 --> 56:04.280]  My thanks to them
[56:04.760 --> 56:09.760]  All right, let's talk about this camera we promised we were gonna talk about the camera at the last break
[56:13.200 --> 56:15.200]  We're doing great
[56:15.200 --> 56:21.880]  Okay, do you want me to start? Mm-hmm. All right, I do here's here's my read
[56:24.480 --> 56:30.560]  So like we're saying Apple and Google are kind of doing similar things Apple's riff is a little bit different
[56:31.560 --> 56:36.600]  So Google pulls together for underexposed images merges them into an HDR photo
[56:38.160 --> 56:42.080]  They you I think you had in your iPhone review that they do it in the cloud
[56:42.080 --> 56:47.080]  That's not they actually do they do it on the phone at caption. Well, so here's where I screwed up in my review
[56:47.080 --> 56:54.760]  And I since edited it you probably read it right away. I was talking about Google as the maker of Android and
[56:55.800 --> 56:57.800]  Android wide the Android
[56:58.280 --> 57:05.320]  Ecosystems way of doing camera processing not the pixel in particular and that's a complete injustice to the pixel
[57:05.320 --> 57:12.040]  So I since edited the article to specifically mention that the pixel is an exception and that the pixel does stuff on camera
[57:12.040 --> 57:18.440]  It's like Google Photos. Yeah, its input is JPEG images from right every phone in the world and Google Photos is Google photo stuff
[57:18.440 --> 57:20.120]  the pixel has
[57:20.120 --> 57:23.320]  Its own custom coprocessor that Google built whatever
[57:23.960 --> 57:25.960]  Pixel visual core it's like a whole thing
[57:25.960 --> 57:31.760]  But philosophically very similar Apple's doing they just take a bunch of photos and merge them together at capture in the camera
[57:32.200 --> 57:33.800]  Apple takes one
[57:33.800 --> 57:40.040]  Overexposed image and I think this is the heart of where I see the differences in the cameras that
[57:40.040 --> 57:45.600]  That overexposed image gives them gives Apple a ton of shadow detail, right?
[57:45.600 --> 57:53.040]  And so they merge that shadow detail back in to my eye and I just want to stress a I told everybody this phone is
[57:53.040 --> 57:57.520]  Great, you'll be happy if you buy it B. I said it it's better iPhone camera than any other iPhone camera
[57:57.600 --> 58:00.120]  So me being like it's not quite as good as a pixel is
[58:00.240 --> 58:06.000]  One totally subjective and B does not mean that I think it's a bad phone people tend to over read my reviews in that way
[58:06.000 --> 58:11.480]  How about everybody over reads everybody's reviews, right? So I'm just like this is a very narrow criticism
[58:12.160 --> 58:13.560]  I
[58:13.560 --> 58:17.760]  Think app the way Apple adds shadow detail back to the photo
[58:18.520 --> 58:20.220]  to my eye
[58:20.220 --> 58:22.220]  flattens the photo in
[58:23.120 --> 58:27.560]  In a weird way where it just reduces the overall contrast of the photo
[58:27.840 --> 58:33.940]  It makes the dark areas and the light areas have the same tone. It just kind of muddies the the photo
[58:33.940 --> 58:38.460]  it reduces what you might call like the drama of the photo and then
[58:39.160 --> 58:41.040]  Into this I don't know for sure
[58:41.040 --> 58:48.120]  But we we looked it up the you noted in your view the image sensor is 32% bigger in the tennis
[58:48.520 --> 58:53.700]  The only image sensor on the market that matches Apple specs is a Samsung sensor
[58:54.280 --> 59:00.400]  So I think they switched from Sony Samsung and that that brought along some of the color differences that Samsung picks up
[59:00.400 --> 59:03.940]  I didn't want to speculate on that, but I did some research while writing my review
[59:03.940 --> 59:08.120]  And so I didn't put it in and and as we record, I don't know
[59:08.120 --> 59:11.620]  I were recording it in mid-afternoon Eastern Time on Friday
[59:11.620 --> 59:12.580]  I
[59:12.580 --> 59:17.680]  Fix it probably has their teardown up already because I know they always they flew they'd literally fly to
[59:17.860 --> 59:22.780]  Australia to get the phone early, so I don't know but I so, you know
[59:22.780 --> 59:27.200]  See I fix the teardown is up and the sensor isn't labeled. So we may never know. Well, we may never know
[59:27.200 --> 59:33.400]  I suspect you're right though that it is I I did some research and I do suspect it's that Samsung sensor that you're talking about
[59:33.400 --> 59:40.300]  Yeah, so that's the change the sensor. So I think that that that's some of the color difference, but then Apple does
[59:41.440 --> 59:43.640]  pretty aggressive noise reduction and
[59:44.220 --> 59:49.600]  so what you end up with is a photo that in the fine details is smoothed out in a way that
[59:50.520 --> 59:57.120]  Again, we've had this whole conversation like my instinct is to be a photographer and then to edit and so I would like the camera
[59:57.120 --> 01:00:03.020]  To have as much detail as possible and then I will monkey with the color and the contrast that stuff
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:08.920]  But if you give me detail, I can't I can't what I can't do is add detail to a photo. So those are my two
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:15.500]  Criticisms of the phone like that's where I think compared to the pixel as a photographer as somebody thinks that way first
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:21.420]  The pixel preserves that detail and it doesn't flatten that image in that way
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:27.540]  And I I completely understand what other people would prefer the iPhone photo, but to me
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:31.080]  It's that loss of detail is the thing that that always takes it down a notch
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:37.000]  yeah, and and to me and it's exactly why I wanted to have you on the show this week is that you're
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.320]  fundamentally your sort of
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:42.280]  benchmark
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:47.560]  for the tennis camera is the pixel 2 and which is fair and
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:54.880]  Interesting because the pixel 2 is like 11 months old and there's a pixel 3 coming out in a couple of weeks at the very least
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:01:01.200]  At you know soon. Yeah, so that they've already it's like it's gonna happen. Yeah
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:03.960]  It's already leaked as all Google things do
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:10.520]  It you know and my comparison is sort of within the you're gonna get it iPhone anyway
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:16.840]  Eco system. What is the year-over-year difference between the 10 and the 10s, you know, and
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:20.840]  And that's you know, I think they're both interesting comparisons
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:28.200]  To me and from my testing from the 10 to 10 s the difference is staggering
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.960]  I'm honestly I really I hope it came across in my review. I'm
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:42.240]  I'm literally flabbergasted that this is a one-year difference in the camera and I really do think that is the single in the entire
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:48.800]  What now 11 year history of the iPhone? I think it's the single greatest year-over-year increase in camera quality
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.040]  I think the five to the six was huge
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:55.240]  I don't remember it exactly but I remember the six was like, oh this is a real camera now
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:58.120]  Well, it's you know, and it's debatable
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:03.160]  I guess and and I know that going to dual lenses was a big deal because all of a sudden you can get a to
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:09.960]  You know quote unquote 2x zoom and you're not doing any optical, you know our digital, you know zoom at all. It's literally optical
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.520]  I
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:18.400]  I'm biased. I've always been biased towards low-light photography
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:22.060]  You know that and and in terms of low-light photography
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:27.680]  I'm I'll go to the mat and say this is the greatest year-over-year upgrade that will ever say because
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:32.000]  32% increase in sensor size is just flabbergasting. It is absolutely
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.640]  You know of of anything, you know
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:36.240]  like, you know
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:40.840]  like they say like the CPU is 15% faster and the GPU is
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:45.080]  50% faster and 50% faster is great for year-over-year, but like
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:52.080]  GPUs and CPUs getting faster is just like a thing that happens in the computer industry
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:03:00.280]  Whereas increasing the size of the sensor on a camera by 32% is is is not like a Moore's law thing
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:05.160]  It's actual physical thing where this thing in a device that is extremely
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:13.680]  Sensitive to you know it think about how small these cameras are compared to quote-unquote real cameras a
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:19.140]  32% increase in sensor size. It's just flabbergasting and yeah, it really shows in the low-light
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:24.360]  Output. Yeah, you know we were so again, you know, I have this like army of people
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.400]  helping me make the review and so
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:31.620]  The number of people who saw these side-by-side photos our video team
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:36.280]  James our creative director who I mean James is a pro photographer
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.680]  He was the the photographer. I'm like the pro windsurfing tour in Hawaii for like a decade, right?
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:46.800]  Like dude has been a pro photographer for 30 plus years
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:51.080]  So like we're all like art. I mean, this is like the most fun part of the week, right?
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:55.760]  We got the new iPhone we're gonna take a thousand photos and then we're all gonna argue about them
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:03.200]  Yeah, that's like what I live for right and every single person was like the 10s makes the 10 look horrible
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:08.160]  Yeah, and the 10 isn't bad. It's just next to the 10s. It looks bad
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:11.920]  So I I spent I took all of these side-by-side photos
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:17.060]  I mean hundreds of photos over the last week and I published a thing on flicker just before we started
[01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:22.000]  You know, I published like the two dozen or so of the the best example some of them
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.240]  You know not really showing a big difference between the two cameras because they were well-lit in well-lit situations
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:29.800]  They're not that different, but I spent the week in
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:35.880]  photos for Mac looking at these side-by-side photos and I
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:43.920]  Didn't really have like a scientific method of like always shoot with the old iPhone 10 first then shoot with the 10s
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.400]  It would be like whichever one was already out and in my hand
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:50.400]  I'd shoot first and then put it in my pocket take the other one out and try to frame the same photo
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:56.440]  And I had the little info window up which will tell you which one is which I
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:01.840]  Very quickly no longer need it, especially in low-light and low-light ones
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.080]  I didn't even need to look which one was 10 and which was 10s
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:09.600]  I instantly was like, oh this is 10 and then I'd look at the info window big. Yep. That's the 10
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:14.040]  This is the 10s. Yep. That's the tennis. Oh, yeah, I didn't need to double-check
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:21.320]  it was that clear and the 10 if you the the amount of smoothing the 10 does through noise reduction is
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:28.520]  Wild like you mean the tennis get in there and look no the 10 Oh compared to the tennis is less
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.680]  Oh, I see 10. Yeah, the 10 is like
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:38.080]  Actually more aggressive with the noise reduction right desperately trying to compensate for the noise that's coming off the sensor, right? Yep, exactly
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:45.360]  So yeah again, you know, I think it's a it's a great camera like it's the best iPhone camera that they've ever made
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.320]  to me, it's it really just comes back to
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:53.160]  Kind of this core question of what do you want the photo to look like?
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:53.760]  Yeah, right
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:06:00.240]  like do you want a great starting point and you're gonna edit or do you want something that is ready to share right away or
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:06.800]  Do you want something that's gonna hold up on a big screen right? Yeah or as a print
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:11.440]  I think most people are like living on Instagram, right? Yeah, like and
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:15.560]  that to me lets them get away with some stuff, but I
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:20.800]  There's just a part of me, you know, see you said it's an 11 11 month old camera the pixel 2
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.040]  There's a part of me it says
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:26.000]  You guys know that's the benchmark, right?
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.240]  But the whole sort of tech press has been saying the pixel 2 is the best camera for a year
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.560]  it's not just the verge like
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:38.440]  Mark has Brownlee. He's a great reviewer has been saying it. He actually said it in his review the tennis too
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:42.880]  It's the number two camera behind a pixel to said the same thing. Joanna has been saying at the journal
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:51.180]  So, you know, that's the benchmark and you know, Apple will never tell you this you can ask them any which way from Sunday
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:54.760]  You can say which metrics did you want to beat the pixel 2 on and they're like, no
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.120]  We just want to make the great camera
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:00.560]  But I'm there I would love to know like where do they think they're better than the pixel?
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:04.120]  Where do they think they're worse and where where does smart HDR is a new?
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:10.800]  Technology with a new sensor go next because I think that this is a new starting place for them
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:16.960]  Yeah, totally instead of refinement of what they've been doing for years with the seven eight nine or seven eight ten
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:23.600]  well, and it's such an interesting contrast because it it is sort of a luxury for
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:29.200]  Google that they don't have to make the pixel in the quantities that
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:33.600]  Apple has to make the iPhone and I'm not trying to excuse it, you know
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:41.240]  But it's different, you know, Apple is going to going to sell, you know, 40 million of these things in the first quarter
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:44.280]  And Google is not going to sell 40 million
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.560]  All right, and it's you know
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:57.280]  But that means though that and I really I guess I am trying to excuse it that Apple has to source a camera
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:00.840]  system an entire hardware camera system that they can make I
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:06.240]  Guess I mean what probably over a hundred million in the next 12 months
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:11.480]  Literally over a hundred million of them in the next 12 months counting. That's an hour, right?
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:16.000]  They've gotten this seems right the 10 are right. So, you know, well, let's count the 10 are right
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.600]  So it probably like 150 million
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:24.080]  I don't know but you know easily way over a hundred million of these camera systems for the wide-angle lens and it's the wide-angle lens
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:31.000]  That's the most interesting to me because the telephone quote-unquote telephoto lens is pretty much the same as last year's it's slightly better
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:37.320]  But it's technically roughly the same. It's the wide-angle lens that gets this new bigger sensor
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:44.380]  And has a different lens element and it's exactly supposedly going to be exactly the same in the 10 are
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:51.480]  So they have to source these and and I feel like it's a luxury for Google with the pixels where they can source
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:55.960]  You know, they can make cameras that they don't have to make a hundred million of you know
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:09:02.200]  Yeah, I mean the pixel to use is a pretty standard Sony sensor like it's a good sensor, right?
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:06.680]  But it's I don't think it was meaningfully different than the Sony sensors Apple was using and Sony
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:10.160]  You know, I said to Vlad one of our
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.080]  editors who folk who is in love with cameras and
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:21.120]  Hey, does this mean like Sony imaging is like if they have switched to Samsung this means Sony imaging is like gonna fall apart
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:26.480]  Because that happens like, you know Apple switched to Intel modems and Qualcomm falls apart, right?
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:32.320]  And he's like no dude, like every phone in China uses a Sony sensor, right? So like
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.960]  Even at Apple scale, they're just like a little blip for this company
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:39.960]  So I I don't know if I agree on the like it's easier for Google
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:44.240]  Like there's a lot of things that are easier for Google and because I don't make as many phones
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:49.360]  But I think here this is what they're doing is a software thing. Yeah, maybe I don't know
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:52.040]  I could be wrong, you know
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:57.440]  But I do think it's interesting that like exactly like you said so many people who I respect
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.960]  You know off the top of my head you you know the verge Joanna
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.400]  Marquez Brownlee
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:09.760]  Are all saying the same thing and and saying that the you know, year-old pixel 2 is still ahead?
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:14.460]  That's interesting to me and it makes me like I said at the outset of the show
[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.680]  I wish I had a pixel 2 instead of a pixel 1 and
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:24.360]  The pixel 3 is coming out man. Well, I'm sure Google will happily tip you right, right? I want to get on that train
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:28.880]  They're gonna try to convince you more than anybody. Well, let me ask you this. So
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:34.880]  What are the pixel twos capabilities with video so still aside
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:37.400]  Let's just concede for the moment that you think you know
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:42.920]  Or let's just say you think still image wise the pixel 2 does a better job than the iPhone tennis. What about video? I
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:48.120]  Think that's the iPhone is it is ahead there right for a couple of reasons
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:53.080]  Wannick it can I'm pretty sure the pixel can't do 4k 60. Let me double check that. I
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:11:00.280]  I don't think it can either and I know that the I've the iPhone tennis is doing amazing things
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:07.960]  With photo with video that is shot at either 30 30 or 24 frames per second where it's shooting
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:15.160]  It's like I have notes on this but my notes were so sort of sketchy and you and I were actually in the same briefing together
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.480]  When we were talking to the camera team
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:23.640]  But Apple is is doing this crazy thing where if you're shooting at 30 frames per second or or 24
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:29.160]  But you know 30 is the the the default they're actually shooting an entire
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:33.240]  Extra frame of video in between frames of video to do
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:39.320]  Dynamic range compensation. Yeah and and reduce noise so it
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:45.560]  It's you're shooting 30 frames per second video and in the mean in in the meantime in between
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:51.400]  The iPhone is taking an extra frame just to make the frames that it's keeping better. Yes
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:56.440]  I think that stabilization is incredible. Yeah, and so I looked at the pixel can only do 4k at 30
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.520]  so I always want to shoot either at 24 or 60 so that I've been just like
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.480]  Immediately wins like yeah, it's shooting in the formats
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:11.560]  I wanted to shoot in and then the thing you're talking about between the optical stabilizer and some of the
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:19.320]  The optical stabilizer and some of the the inter frame stabilization they're doing it just looks better. Yeah, and then on top of that
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:20.840]  um
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:24.600]  Our audio engineer was super impressed with the fact that the tennis
[01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:26.360]  records
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:28.360]  Stereo audio. Yes
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:35.000]  And you can sort of hear it on the you know, the wide stereo speakers, but it actually is stereo audio
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:39.960]  Um, which virtually no other phone can do especially a phone at apple scale
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:43.960]  yeah, it's it's absolutely staggering what they're doing with video and
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:46.120]  um
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:47.880]  It's funny like you and I you know
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:51.560]  they they they had us grouped in groups of three and
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:57.480]  We recycled around and talked to a bunch of people behind the scenes after the event in these briefings and you and I were in
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.680]  this group
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.280]  and we got to talk to
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:05.560]  Two people from the camera team one one guy who was sort of on the hardware side and one on the software side and you
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:11.400]  You know, we got all this great information and it was really interesting and you particularly asked some great questions
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:15.480]  And I've you know, I was like, oh that's interesting and we got these great answers and then we're like on the way out the door
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.960]  Because they're like you got to go on, you know
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:21.880]  You got to go on and the guy just says to us. Oh, by the way, low light video is amazing
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:26.360]  Right. It's like be sure to test that and it was like what wait what?
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:31.960]  And then I shot some i've got two examples on my this flicker page. I just linked to
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:33.560]  um
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:40.120]  that are just staggering like just literally not just like oh, this is okay, and this is better but like literally
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:41.800]  the
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:44.460]  Iphone 10 footage is like borderline
[01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:50.600]  Unusable and the iphone 10s footage on video in low light is actually pretty good
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:54.440]  like one is a fountain in a park here in philadelphia and one was
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  Um, I shot in this uh, great restaurant that my family loves, uh here in philly called uh, double nut
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.760]  um
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.560]  But it's super dark. I mean it is like crazy dark
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:09.320]  It is like I feel like i'm blind like I feel like I can't even get to my table
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:12.360]  it's so dark and I shot this footage of my son and it's like
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:18.840]  The the footage from my iphone 10 is exactly what I expected to get from a cell phone camera shooting video in this really dark room
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:20.840]  It is like unusable and then I shot
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:26.120]  Footage with the 10s and it is like this is actually pretty good. This is brighter than real life
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.760]  Yeah, that's my that's my
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:31.160]  um matt mucannon who is now the um
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:34.440]  executive editor eater and he sits just
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:39.880]  You know a hundred yards away from me in the office. I didn't know that he was there. I love matt mucannon
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:43.960]  Yeah, he's great. He was a eater. He was like when I was at n gadget. I was like baby blogger
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:50.860]  He was like my rival at gizmodo. Yeah, they used to want to be smarter than matt all the time and he wrote this headline
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:55.080]  uh that I think about every day because it was such a
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:59.640]  He was just smarter than me faster that that probably bothers you as much as bothers me but uh
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:02.680]  Iso is the new megapixel
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:09.160]  Right. Yes, and what he meant was yes performance and this is years ago. It's like yeah 2009 or something
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:12.200]  He wrote this and I I think about all the time like that's what you want
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:18.360]  You want great low light performance and then you can almost excuse anything else like because that's where you are
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:23.880]  You're always you know, you don't have a lighting rig with you or whatever and you're often in like a weird situation
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:28.760]  And if you can get the light out of the scene, you're way ahead. Yeah, I remember you know
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:33.400]  And it's one of those things that I don't know what the turning point was, but I remember
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:40.360]  Let's just say like eight years ago. I don't know like I was totally on the side of you know
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:45.320]  Every couple of weeks i'm posting something uh along the lines of you know
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:52.520]  Let's stop measuring our cameras by megapixel. This is absolutely, you know, yes more megapixels
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:54.520]  In general are better
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:16:00.760]  But given all of the other factors like the fact that sensors can't get bigger and that we're making cameras smaller and smaller
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.760]  Etc. Etc. Uh
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:06.360]  Megapixels is the worst way to measure cameras that you can you know
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:14.520]  You're way better off at the same sensor size with bigger pixels and fewer of them than more pixels that are smaller
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:19.480]  Yeah, and I remember you know harping about it and then I realized with this phone
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:26.360]  Writing this review where where the megapixel count is exactly the same as the iphone 10 and it's 32 bigger
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:29.480]  That it I haven't made this argument in a while
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:32.360]  it's like people have sort of they have like it like
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:38.600]  We like you people like me and you have finally like gotten it through to everybody to stop measuring
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:42.440]  Cameras by megapixel 12 megapixels is plenty it is
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:48.120]  Way more than enough for almost everything and sure 20 years from now i'm going to have to do it
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:53.480]  Sure, 20 years from now. I'm sure we'll look back and laugh at 12 megapixel cameras. We'll be like, oh my god
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:17:00.680]  That's ridiculous. But for the meantime given all of the other constraints and all of the other advantages. It's so much better to have
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:06.920]  Bigger pixels and then like you said like with matt bukenstein to be able to go to higher iso and have
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.880]  Not have you know crazy amounts of noise in the image
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:13.400]  Yeah, I mean you see it all over the industry too like
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:18.280]  dgi just put out new mavics and one has a smaller sensor and a big like a
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.600]  A bigger zoom lens, you know has a bigger sensor like
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:27.800]  The market is now sophisticated enough that it's applying sort of the right sensor to the right moment, right?
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:30.520]  And that it used to just be an arms race, right?
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:35.960]  And and you know, let's face it. I mean, I mean, this is a statement of the obvious but
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:40.360]  It I think it deserves to be called out like 99 of the photos
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:46.120]  Maybe even more maybe even more than 99 percent that i'm almost sure it's got to be more than 99 percent of
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:53.080]  The photos that people take with their cell phone camera are handheld with no physical stabilization
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:56.840]  Not even like just resting it not even put aside tripods
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:02.440]  But not even like putting it on a table or something to stabilize it. Everything is handheld and so
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  Anything you can do?
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.600]  to get
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:12.280]  Uh slower or faster shutter speeds with a proper exposure is is a win
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:17.560]  Yeah, you know, I actually had never really thought about it that way like we're
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:20.520]  there the real race is
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:27.080]  How much like you captured a fast shutter speed to compensate for for handheld shake, right? How would you put that in a spec?
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:29.080]  How can we make that an arms race?
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:34.120]  Yeah, I don't know if we just if we make that a number and say this it's better when this number is higher
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:38.840]  Like samsung will figure it out, right? That's how they think like we just need to beat that number
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.320]  well, and the other factor that that figures into that too is that
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:47.000]  you don't see the difference between
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:50.840]  A faster exposure a shorter, you know
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:57.320]  You know being able to shoot at like let's say in really low light and get a 1 30th of a second instead of like
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.400]  1 15th of a second exposure
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:05.000]  You don't even see it on the screen on the phone because like maybe if you're you're you're trying to hold your hand still
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.800]  And you take it but the amount of blur that you get from your hand moving in that
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:12.280]  1 15th of a second doesn't even show up on the screen
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:16.520]  It only shows up when you do put it on like a bigger screen like your mac or something like that
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:18.200]  So you don't even know
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:23.240]  That you should retake the photo because it's a little blurry because it doesn't show up on the the tiny little
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:27.640]  Quote-unquote tiny little 6.5 inch screen, right? Yeah
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:28.920]  Right. Yeah
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:33.800]  and that's that that's the heart of it right like to me the heart of it is
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:38.440]  What do I take pictures of the most it's my kid. Yep, and
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:42.200]  I want those photos to last I want to look at those photos
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:45.240]  20 years from now and show them to her and be like look
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:52.760]  Look at how insane your hair was right like uh, and that means I need definition in her hair like that's pretty basic and like
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:54.840]  to me the
[01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:58.760]  The argument for the pixel is I feel more confident
[01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:05.000]  In any situation that it will get that detail out of the photo. Yeah, right and like is that a great argument?
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.760]  Like is that the argument that's going to win everyone's decision-making process? No, do I carry an iphone?
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:18.120]  It's my primary phone sure as hell do like do I would I prefer to have a more privacy focused phone?
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:22.440]  That doesn't you know, like do I prefer apple's app model and sandbox?
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:25.560]  Like yeah, all those things like that's why I have an iphone
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.240]  But man, do I wish I had that pixel camera like
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:33.400]  Do I wish I could push a button and get it to act more like the pixel? I absolutely do
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:39.560]  All right. Let me take one last break here and thank our third and final sponsor. It is this scrappy young company
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:40.840]  I never heard of him
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.840]  squarespace
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.720]  Look
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:47.720]  Squarespace, it's a
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:52.120]  You've probably you know, whoever's listening is you've probably never heard of them, but they're they have an amazing service
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:53.640]  It is absolutely
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:58.840]  Flabbergasting you go there. Let's say you need a website you go to squarespace and you can do everything there
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.680]  You can get your domain name
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:04.280]  You can pick a template they have tons of templates. It is amazing
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:08.360]  How many templates you can start from to get an amazing looking website you can customize it?
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:14.920]  Every pixel of the entire website you can you can customize to the utmost degree
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:16.840]  uh
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:18.280]  They host the website
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:23.320]  They are the cms. So like if you want to have like a blog or you want to host a podcast or something like that
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:30.360]  You do it all through squarespace. They have a great user interface for this stuff. Uh, absolutely great. They do their own analytics
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:33.560]  So you want to see who's coming to your website? How many people are looking at your website?
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:38.760]  All of the analytics are there and it's so well designed. It's the best analytics interface
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:41.400]  I've ever seen
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:48.220]  All of it at one place everything from design to hosting to serving the site to the analytics
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:52.760]  To even doing the e-commerce if you want to have a store if you need like to sell stuff
[01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:56.040]  and doing all of the secure stuff to do the
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:04.520]  Uh online credit card processing etc. Do it right and do it secure. They host they do it all it is absolutely fabulous
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:09.640]  And they have abs they have truly award-winning technical support 24 hours a day

[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:18.600]  And if you do have questions, they'll tell you what to do. It is absolutely amazing
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:24.520]  So the next time you or anybody, you know who comes to you because you're a nerd and they come to you like hey
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:27.240]  I need a website. What should I do send them to squarespace?
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:30.040]  And if you go to squarespace.com
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:32.100]  talk show
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:33.160]  squarespace.com
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:34.600]  talk show
[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:40.680]  When you decide to pay use that code talk show and you will save 10 off your first purchase
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:47.080]  And that includes you can pay for a year in advance so you can save 10 on an entire year by using that code
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:49.400]  talk show at squarespace.com
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:50.840]  slash
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:52.840]  talk show
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.320]  I I do think that I you know
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:59.080]  So going back to the can I I the camera to me defines the iphone 10s
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:05.560]  And in terms of where it is versus the competition and on the android side of the fence and where it is
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:07.480]  versus
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:14.760]  Previous iphones it it's to me and that I literally wrote my entire review about the camera. I didn't even mention anything else
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:17.400]  Yeah, I mean like
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:20.120]  We're talking about how fast how much faster the processor is. Yep
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:22.920]  You know apple put lisa jackson on stage on a keynote
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:27.560]  They're like we want these products to last for a long time and sort of a question. I ask them every year is
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:35.160]  Well, hey the gpu and the a11 was 30 percent faster than the gpu and the a10 like is that does that maxed out?
[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:40.200]  You you're running that thing red hot all the time. I'm like no no I think of that as headroom like that
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.200]  They're building these processors to last for a long time
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:50.760]  Yep, and they're able to put ios 12 on five-year-old devices and make them perform better so that like
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.960]  just the amount of
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:24:00.680]  Credit apple gets for that I think is out of whack. Like that's one of the best things they do and they're their lead in
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:03.400]  smartphone processors
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:08.360]  Is so out of control that we I don't think we stopped to like consider it enough, right? Yeah
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:10.440]  so
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:16.760]  It's are you gonna notice a difference between did you notice that 10s outside of like an ar demo that uses neural engine?
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:19.960]  Did you notice it's much faster than the 10? Nope?
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:23.400]  Right. It's like the 10 is great. No, so what is the true?
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:31.320]  Did you notice it has gigabit lte like no because I I try I I did some speed tests and apparently there is no gigabit
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:37.160]  Lte or at least on verizon here in philadelphia, so I don't know where I have to go to try it but because I asked
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:44.600]  I asked because the one one of the it's it's so minor and I don't mind but the one thing one of the things that I
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:51.660]  Dislike about the 10s compared to the 10 is that the antenna bands on the stainless steel frame are asymmetrical
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:58.120]  Whereas the 10 was perfectly symmetrical and it really the part that really bothers me aren't the antenna lines
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:03.560]  It's the speaker grills on the bottom of the phone where there's only three holes on the left and six holes on the right
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:09.480]  As opposed to six and six like it was before and it's because there's no room for the extra holes
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:17.720]  because of the the new speaker line or antenna line and I asked and I thought maybe that was about the dual sim thing that
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:21.800]  they had to have different antennas for the two sims, but they said no it was all about this thing about the
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:24.520]  It's the gigabit lte
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:29.400]  So that's great. I would love to have gigabit lte verizon. Please roll it out in philadelphia
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:33.800]  but apparently it's not here yet because I don't I didn't get any better lte per and
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:38.120]  Verizon is very good in philadelphia. I get very good at it. I get very good at it
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:43.000]  Very good in philadelphia. I get very good lte service, but it's not better than the iphone 10
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:47.960]  Um, this is totally tangential, but there's there's just like growing
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:55.640]  Like discontent in sort of the wireless policy world that there are actually no good maps of coverage
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:00.200]  In the united states, I believe everyone is lying. So like
[01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:06.440]  Policymakers can't be like hey, we need to like spend more money in kansas to put more coverage here, right?
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:08.440]  Because they don't actually know
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:10.040]  um and like
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:15.240]  You can I just googled where is gigabit lte and like no, no, I did the same thing
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:19.480]  I was like I I did a speed test to see if it was here and it wasn't and I was like
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:24.840]  Well, is there anywhere nearby where I can test it and I was like there's like nothing that nobody knows. It's all you know
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:28.060]  Yeah, but it's that stuff like these are incremental
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:30.920]  The phone will last longer five years from now
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:34.840]  Maybe verizon will have gigabit lte and philly and your phone will be better but compared to the 10
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:39.080]  It's the same and like so yeah, it's down to that camera. Yeah
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:45.640]  Um, did you notice the photos taken on the camera have 60 greater dynamic range on the 10s screen?
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:51.080]  No, like people ask me about it. Like I don't I don't i'm a picky asshole with this shit
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:54.360]  I can't see it. I I don't see that either. Well and
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:27:02.760]  It brings me to to me the the the elephant in the room of this whole thing is the iphone 10r
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:06.520]  Yeah, and I you know, they don't apple
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:09.720]  in my personal experience
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:12.040]  apple never seeds
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.200]  review units
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:21.560]  More than like 10 days before they ship that's just everything i've ever gotten from them is always i've never gotten anything further in advance
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:23.160]  so for example
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:25.480]  famously last year when the
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:32.460]  The flagship one the iphone 10 was the one that was delayed and wasn't going to ship immediately after the event in september
[01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:37.580]  Everybody, you know, we got the iphone 8 to review and everybody's like what I don't want the iphone
[01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:40.700]  I don't want the iphone. I want the 10 i'm so excited for the 10
[01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:44.300]  Why are you giving me this thing that i'm not excited about, you know
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:45.660]  um
[01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:49.980]  And you know to my knowledge and i'm i'd be shocked if anybody has one
[01:27:49.980 --> 01:27:56.940]  nobody has an iphone 10r review unit and the reviews i'm guessing will will happen exactly on the same schedule like if you
[01:27:57.580 --> 01:27:59.580]  You know, i'm guessing we'll get them
[01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:03.500]  I think it ships on the 26th and pre-orders of the 19th
[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:10.220]  In october, so i'm guessing that anybody who gets a iphone 10r review unit will get it before
[01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:14.540]  Sometime early in the week of the night, you know that the friday ends on the 19th
[01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:21.740]  So probably like I don't know monday or tuesday of that week will get review units and the embargo will be three or four days
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:26.540]  Before they ship on the 26th because that's just their schedule is almost in stone
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:28.940]  Yeah, um
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:34.380]  But so all that said my experience with the iphone 10r is at the event
[01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:40.060]  In the hands-on area afterwards and then in a in a brief brief, you know
[01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:43.580]  Off the record briefing afterwards. I got to play with one, uh
[01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:44.780]  backstage
[01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:46.780]  or or behind the scenes, um
[01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:50.620]  I haven't so I haven't seen one since and I didn't get a lot of side-by-side time
[01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:56.140]  But I have to say from my eyes and I you know, my eyes i'm 45 my eyes are declining
[01:28:56.620 --> 01:29:01.500]  I don't really see the difference between the two displays side by side. They they both look great to me
[01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:06.540]  I I know that with darks I I can see it like you're watching a video or something with dark stuff
[01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:09.020]  I can see the oled advantages when it's dark
[01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:12.140]  But when the screen is like lit up and you're just like looking at mail
[01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:15.420]  I don't the 10r screen looks fantastic to me and like
[01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:20.460]  I did a thing where I like held them side by side and just looked at the home screen and like look at all the
[01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:28.620]  Icon colors and the the 10r looks fabulous. I mean, I know it's a lesser screen, but it's a really good screen and it's 250 bucks
[01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:31.500]  Less yeah, I think lesser is a really interesting
[01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:38.060]  Frame for that right like it lcd's are way better on some metrics than oled
[01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:42.220]  Right and oled is way better on some metrics than others. So for years
[01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:47.820]  I would publish iphone reviews of the lcd models of the eight plus or the seven or whatever
[01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:50.540]  And I would say the iphone has the best display in the market
[01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:55.580]  Right, right and all the android fanboys in the world would like scream at me that like
[01:29:56.140 --> 01:30:01.580]  Samsung's oleds if you look at them long enough or so bright, they'll like burn your eyes out the back yourself. Um
[01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:05.500]  And so that's true in like the black, you know, like all that stuff is true
[01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:09.660]  But apple has always had their lcd's have always been the most accurate
[01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:15.420]  They've always been the most pleasing to look at they do the best sort of aliasing tricks that anybody does
[01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:18.140]  And so if you remember last year with the 10
[01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:24.940]  The question was can apple make an oled that looks as good as their lcd that isn't as crazy with colors and saturation
[01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:27.340]  I think they accomplished it
[01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:34.060]  So it lesser is like a really interesting. Yeah to me like they're obviously different
[01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:36.060]  right, but
[01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:40.940]  The real questions are I know what apple is doing because it's a smart thing to do
[01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:45.100]  Is they're putting all of their best stuff into the oled so, you know
[01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:51.980]  The razor phone has like 120 hertz refresh lcd the iphone 10r does not right? Yeah
[01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:57.340]  Do I want that do I love promotion on the ipad? Yeah, can the lcd do it, right?
[01:30:57.340 --> 01:31:02.380]  Is there lcd technology in this world that can do it? Yes. Is it in the 10r? No, so it's like an interesting
[01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:07.980]  So it's like an interesting spec comparison like where are they trying to land this screen?
[01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:11.260]  And how does it really work in comparison to the oled?
[01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:17.180]  Side by side that hands on there's no way I could tell the difference. The one thing I got was
[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:20.620]  I brought a macro lens to the event
[01:31:21.100 --> 01:31:26.860]  And I took a bunch of super close-up photos of the notch and the curved corners because I heard phil shiller say
[01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:32.140]  We're doing really advanced anti-aliasing to make these corners work. And I thought what does that mean?
[01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:33.500]  and
[01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:39.260]  They are the you know, if you look at the iphone 10 notch, that's a totally smooth curve of pixels
[01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:41.900]  the
[01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:48.060]  10r is a there's like a there's like a gradient curve going on there. It's super interesting to me
[01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:51.500]  I'm very curious how that works. Yeah, I am too and
[01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:58.300]  You know and it's you know, we can't go on at length about it because we haven't had the 10r to test but the the basic
[01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:01.820]  thing that i'm hearing from a lot of people who read daring fireball and is
[01:32:02.540 --> 01:32:04.540]  Hey, I don't really use the
[01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:07.660]  2x camera on my plus that much
[01:32:08.140 --> 01:32:11.980]  and so i'm kind of leaning towards just getting the 10r and
[01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:17.660]  Am I missing anything like I it seems like it's just as good and 250 less
[01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:20.780]  $50 less I think they're going to sell a billion of these
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:29.500]  Absolutely. I I really really do. I I honestly think that the premium you pay for the 10s versus the 10r
[01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:36.300]  Is really fundamentally just about the second camera lens, which is you know, if you use it
[01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:43.020]  It's significant and that it's just slightly nicer, you know stainless steel is nicer than aluminum. Olad is nicer than
[01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:51.600]  Lcd overall, but it's just a little nicer and if you really think that the 10r is nice enough then you're you're just honestly
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:56.640]  You're not missing anything. You're not missing anything apple. It isn't holding anything back
[01:32:56.880 --> 01:33:02.160]  You they want you to buy it if you want it. It's still a 750 phone to start. It's not you know
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:09.200]  You know, but but I really do feel like from the twitter and email feedback i've gotten from readers that they're they're they're like
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:10.560]  What am I missing?
[01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:16.320]  Yeah, and it's like you're missing nothing. Just go get pre-order the 10r as soon as they start taking pre-orders because you're you're
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:18.800]  You know, you've got the right thing going on, you know
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:23.520]  There's like the the sort of like verge alumni mafia in the world now like, you know
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:25.680]  Joanna wrote she used to be a reviewer at the word
[01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:32.000]  She's at the journal lauren goode is wired and like all of us landed in the same place which made me laugh which was
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:36.560]  This phone is great, but wait for us to review the 10r and then we'll tell you what to do
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:42.240]  Right, and that wasn't like a yeah, it wasn't court. It was just like very funny because I know how everyone thinks
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:44.800]  Uh, we all obviously work together. So
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:46.480]  uh
[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:51.920]  It was just really funny because you know the point of a review for us. I don't know if it's the point for you
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:57.200]  um, you you know what daring fireball does is different but the point for me and
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:03.840]  For joanna and for lauren and other people who run these big consumer pubs is to help people make purchase decisions
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:06.240]  Yes to help people spend money
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:09.680]  and so for us all of us landed in the same place, which was
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:15.300]  We cannot at this moment help you make this purchase decision because we don't have all the information
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:21.600]  And it's I think that that's not bad for apple. It means people are gonna buy iphones, but it does mean
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:24.800]  The 10r reviews are gonna be
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:30.080]  The scrutiny of that phone I think will be higher than the scrutiny of the 10s. I do too and I
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:34.160]  and I it's an interesting flip year over year because
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:39.360]  Last year when the 10 first came out and the iphone 8 and 8 plus were great phones
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:41.840]  And if there had been no iphone 10 last year
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:46.400]  They would have been fine. There would have been definitely some some
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:52.080]  Legitimate criticism about the fact that if if there were no iphone 10 a year ago
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:58.960]  There would have been some legit criticism that I've apple is behind the curve on getting these edge to edge displays
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:01.360]  You know that the the chin and forehead look
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:08.340]  You know, they're they're you know behind they're they're clearly behind it's better not to have big chins and foreheads
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:14.800]  And the iphone 8 and 8 plus still had the traditional big chin and forehead that would have been legit
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:19.520]  But otherwise they were totally credible, you know 2017 phones
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:21.680]  um
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:25.200]  But given that the 10 existed there was just this huge
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:28.800]  Chasm in quality and interest and and you know
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:33.520]  Uh between the iphone 8 and 8 plus which were good phones, you know, they're fine
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.800]  But the 10 was better in so many ways and just looked better in so many ways and was better
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:43.040]  whereas this year it is the complete opposite where the the
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:47.280]  Again, not in hand yet. So let's wait and see but to me
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:54.720]  Me the 10r is the new iphone. It is the one that more people are going to buy the one that more people should buy
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:01.280]  And the the 10s is just sort of like a trim level that you're paying 250 for
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:04.400]  Yeah, you know, it's like
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:06.080]  What's the new product?
[01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:08.080]  Yeah, fundamentally
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:12.560]  I'm very what do you make of them not selling the 10 anymore?
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:17.840]  Well, I think it's I think it's very obvious. It doesn't fit in the product line and I think it's exactly like
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:26.080]  The the fact that when the original iphone was replaced by the 3g that they just dumped the original it was it was you know
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:28.480]  Almost like they shipped a prototype, you know
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:30.240]  right
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:33.680]  And they did the same thing with the iphone 5
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:37.760]  Right where so we had the iphone 5 and then when they came out with the 5s
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:42.240]  they dumped the 5 and had the 5c which was the phone with the the
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:49.920]  The fives internals but a different case and it was because that case was very expensive to make you know
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:55.040]  Like the the chamfered edges along the iphone 5 and 5s and the se
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:00.960]  It was not cheap to make and you know, the plastic of the 5c was cheaper to make
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:06.800]  I think that's exactly what's going on with the iphone 10 and if you think about it, it doesn't fit
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:14.000]  Like if given the existence of the 10r and the 10s if they did keep the iphone 10 around and sold just you know
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  Like a 128 gigabyte version of it. Where does it fit in a product line? Because the camera is so much worse, right?
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:27.040]  Did the 10r at 750 dollars is absolutely a better phone than than the year-old iphone 10
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:35.040]  Wow, that's a big call. Well, I I guess absolutely is maybe not quite clear because the iphone 10 does have the dual camera system
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:41.360]  But the wide angle lens is so much better in the 10r and I to me that outweighs the advantages of the iphone
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:43.520]  10's oled versus the 10r's lcd
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:50.640]  It's it it it would make for a very confusing product line if they still sold even just one one model of the iphone 10
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:57.040]  It just doesn't fit. I think the way to look at it is the 10r has replaced the 10, right? Yes, exactly
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:04.560]  And it's overall I think overall it is better it it you know that the the computational photography stuff that they get on the 10
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:10.320]  Stuff that they get from this neural engine and and the bigger sensor. I I would I would rather have a 10r than the 10
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:12.400]  Even though I don't I don't like the size
[01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:16.960]  The only thing I don't like about the 10r is I think 6.1 is too big as the one and only size
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:19.440]  The one of the biggest pieces, you know
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:22.480]  one of the biggest pieces of feedback
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:25.120]  like after the event not for us, but for like apple was
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:29.760]  People on the verge staff and people out in the world being like I just want a small phone
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:35.200]  Yeah, I just want that iphone sc size with a with a full like a edge-to-edge display
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:40.240]  And I where i've landed is it's the same thing as the photo stuff
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:44.000]  There's what you think you want and then there's what you prefer
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.480]  Yeah, right and it just like it feels like everyone in the world has the data to say
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:51.360]  Actually, no one buys the small phone. Yeah
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:53.280]  Well, but on the other hand
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:59.280]  We do know that the iphone se was actually more popular than apple expected and they were actually it was sold out
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:02.240]  Weeks in advance for a lot longer, you know when it first came out
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:08.400]  So was that because of the price or was it because of the size, you know, who knows but I I think that there's enough
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:12.160]  I feel like we're never going to see an iphone as small as the se again
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:18.000]  But I my secret hope and I have absolutely no inside juice on this at all and and the rumors
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:21.600]  Probably won't crank up until like january or so if it's true
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:25.920]  But the way that last year we only got one size of the iphone 10
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:30.000]  This is it one and only because they were like pushing the envelope. This is the one size
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.520]  We're going to make and now this year we've got two we've got that one and a bigger one
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:36.080]  My secret hope is that next year
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:40.000]  There's a successor to the 10r. That's smaller
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:44.960]  You know and it would be and and also smaller than the iphone
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:50.640]  10s you know what I mean the the 5.8 in size it would you know, I mean like so
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:58.080]  So the smallest would be in in in my dream world next year the smallest new iphone would be the the 10r
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:00.720]  Then that they they would
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:02.960]  Call like the 6.1
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:09.840]  You know what? I mean these names these names are getting away from them so fast. Oh, it's impossible to talk about I
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:12.480]  I I think
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:16.080]  I off the top of my head. I've been trying to do it right this whole episode
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:21.680]  I think that i've said 10 every time I haven't said x but i've probably said x ago. I don't know but
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:26.960]  Everyone's gonna call it the xr. I can get away with 10s for some reason. Yeah, I don't know why but
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:32.800]  Xr just sounds cool. Well, i'll tell you this and and I know we got to wrap up. Um, yeah
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:35.840]  as a writer
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:41.520]  I have to think of it as x because i'm typing an x and my brain i i've i've i'm not going to go on a
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:49.200]  rant about roman numerals, but I fucking hate roman numerals and and I really hate roman numerals and and I was so excited
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:52.720]  I've said this I have said this on the show a couple of times, but I was so excited
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:54.400]  I know you're a football fan, too
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:41:00.320]  I was so excited for super bowl 50 when the nfl switched to five zero instead of using roman numerals
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:02.880]  And I thought this is such a great out for them
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:09.600]  Here it is. It's 50 and now they'll just use regular numbers and then when they went back to roman numerals for 51
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:13.440]  I I like lost my mind. I'm like, oh my god, you had your out
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:19.840]  Nobody likes this. This isn't classy. It's just confusing. Nobody knows. Yeah, I I
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:23.200]  But when i'm writing so here's the thing
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:27.360]  It's just a little bit of inside baseball like when i'm writing I have to think of it as x so
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:32.320]  and when i'm writing i'm thinking of it as the xs and the xr because that's what i'm typing but I get my
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:37.600]  As and ands wrong if I don't use the iphone if I say faster than a
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:38.800]  A
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:40.800]  Xs, but that's wrong
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:47.120]  Or than an xs, right I would write an xs, but I have to write a
[01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:54.400]  Xs because it's really 10s and so you want a instead of an and so like it was like this little nitpick and
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:58.160]  You know, it literally eight in the morning after pulling an all-nighter
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:00.800]  I've got I always print my article if it's a long article
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:04.160]  I always print put it on paper and take a red pen to it and i've got like
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:09.840]  A hundred little a's and ands that are so inconsistent. Oh
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:12.480]  They have to switch next year. There's
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:16.000]  There's no way they're sticking with roman numerals. They can't
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:21.040]  Wait, are you talking about the nfl or no apple apple nfl nfl is a lost cause
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:23.520]  If the nfl didn't take that
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:29.040]  Super bowl 50 as their chance to change they're never going to I mean their next chance to do it is like super bowl 100
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:31.120]  And we're going to be dead. Yeah
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:36.960]  Uh roman numerals famously, uh, a number of existence that did not have the concept of zero. So
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:39.680]  Really the best choice that you want. Uh
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:45.120]  I think apple's brand is iphone 10. I think they're gonna stick with it
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:49.680]  And drive us insane right because iphone 10 is what they mean
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:55.040]  When they mean a edge to edge screen with a notch. Yeah, but then where did they go, you know, like, uh,
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:57.840]  They can't what are they gonna do pick new letters?
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:04.880]  Why not like there's just 24 left like let's see that iphone x or iphone k or whatever, right?
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:08.880]  Or like I wrote my article like iphone xx, you know the iphone 10x
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:12.640]  With two x's like it would be insane
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:18.560]  But I at this point I wouldn't be shocked if they did it like there so it looks like iphone xx
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:21.440]  And you're supposed to say 10x. It would be crazy
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:26.800]  I mean it has already happened to me that i've been talking about my kid and said max and somebody has thought about that
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:33.200]  And somebody has thought about the phone like i'm just like it's just like a personal affront to me, but we'll get through it
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:37.520]  Uh, all right. I i'm gonna call that a wrap. This has been a great show
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:42.480]  Uh, yeah, I mean thank you. I it's so good to have you back on the show and it was so good to have this
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:45.760]  This conversation. Let me thank our sponsors. We had uh, let me think about this
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:50.800]  We had squarespace where you go to make a website. We had hello pillow where you can get a buckwheat pillow
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:57.200]  And last but not least we had uh, trace pontas where where you can get some delicious coffee. So my thanks to them
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:02.400]  My thanks to you. Nilay. Everybody can follow you on twitter as uh, reckless
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:06.400]  Yeah, r e c k l e s s great twitter account
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:13.520]  You and I always have some good back and forth there. And of course, uh, you and all of your excellent colleagues at the verge
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:16.720]  Thank you so much. By the way, if you want to see some good twitter
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:23.440]  John, and I had a great conversation about the iphone 3gs keynote a few days ago. That was iphone 3g not 3gs 3g
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:26.560]  Right. Yes, go watch that. It's incredible. Yeah, you know what? That's funny
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:32.000]  It's funny you bring that up and I it it was lost in the shuffle of me trying to get these reviews together
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.720]  But you brought this up on twitter. That is such a great thing. You you
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:38.640]  You mentioned this and i'll put it in the show notes it
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:44.720]  It's stunning you brought it up as as sort of like the the canonical like
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:48.160]  canonical like or not canonical but like an
[01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:57.360]  Unheralded steve jobs keynote. It's totally underrated like right. It's so it's it's so remarkably efficient
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:44:59.600]  and it still seems
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:06.400]  Like just looking like the app store 3g like it's just like it just like bangs through it. It's incredible
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:11.280]  So the gist of it and you're right. I kind of had forgotten it and I was there in the room for it
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:17.600]  It so everybody remembers the original iphone keynote. It's it's like the what it is. I've always said and I I think
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:26.320]  I expect to finish my career and still say that the apple keynote was the original iphone
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:29.120]  keynote because everything you'd want
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:32.160]  Just a flabbergasting
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:37.680]  Everything you could dream of this it really is. It's not just an ipod with a cell phone
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:42.800]  It is literally a new computing platform. It's os 10 running on a cell phone and has this
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:46.480]  Wonderful new interface and blah blah blah and it was all secret
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:52.320]  Nothing had leaked, you know other than the vague rumor that apple was quote unquote going to announce a phone
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:56.080]  That was the only thing that leaked was that they might really be announcing a phone at mac world
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:46:00.240]  It was the keynote because the the what it looked like is hardware what it looked like
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:06.880]  It's software had all been kept under wraps. So in terms of actually having a humongous surprise. It was it
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:10.320]  But then a a year and a half later when the 3g came out
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:15.760]  I it is totally forgotten like it was it was 20 minutes
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:22.560]  At the end of the wwdc keynote so they didn't even hold an event for it
[01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:27.040]  It was just 20 minutes at the end of the wwdc keynote apple
[01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:30.160]  Steve jobs unveiled the iphone 3g
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:36.320]  and it was it it it really was the iphone that exploded like the original iphone very
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:40.000]  Very few of them was sold. I think they only sold like six million of them
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:46.800]  Uh, you know, they probably sold more than that in the first 15 seconds of the pre-order a week ago. Uh
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:54.080]  It the the 3g keynote i'll put it in the show notes you've got to watch it it is 20 minutes long
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:59.280]  And it was in the middle of a wwdc and like you said it is incredibly efficient it is
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:03.680]  Yeah, I mean he's like you're all the problem like he says like
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:09.620]  56 percent of people think the iphone is too expensive. Well problem solved like starting price 199 like
[01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:15.700]  80 percent of people are used exchange. So we added enterprise support like he's like here are all the problems
[01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:18.740]  I solved them get out of here buy an iphone. See you later edges edges
[01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:22.900]  Edge is too slow. Here's 3g and like you said like you called this out
[01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:26.260]  You called this out on twitter like to show how much faster it was
[01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:30.180]  He actually just stood aside quietly and let web pages load
[01:47:30.180 --> 01:47:35.220]  Yeah, it's 20 minutes and one minute is silent
[01:47:36.980 --> 01:47:44.340]  One yeah one one minute is waiting for the new york times home page to load on an edge network just
[01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:50.660]  Yeah, it's it's so unlike anything anyone would do today it is
[01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:55.460]  Nobody, but steve jobs could pull it off. It really is it so the better keynote
[01:47:55.540 --> 01:47:59.860]  Obviously the better announcement is the original one but in terms of like a performance like
[01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:06.740]  And what steve jobs could do on stage that nobody else ever could do it's it's a better example
[01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:08.820]  It's actually a better jobs performance
[01:48:09.380 --> 01:48:13.060]  Yeah, because I mean no one else is making people wait a minute
[01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:17.300]  And everybody clapped everybody was like
[01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:20.740]  Everybody was like clapping like thank you for making me watch that
[01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:24.260]  By the way, the 3g phone took 21 seconds
[01:48:25.060 --> 01:48:28.260]  It was still an eternity and he's like look at how much faster
[01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:32.580]  Well, that's funny too. And I did notice that and I I it's it's one of those things
[01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:34.260]  I don't know if i've ever written about it or not
[01:48:34.260 --> 01:48:40.660]  But it is funny because then he even compared it to wi-fi and wi-fi was 18 seconds and it's you know
[01:48:40.820 --> 01:48:44.020]  Like the the truth of it is is that web pages are?
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:49.300]  Computationally very expensive to render and so like 10 years ago
[01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:52.660]  It it. Yes, it was very slow on edge
[01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:58.100]  but actually most of the time you spent that your phone spent rendering the page was actually like
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:02.260]  html being rendered through the cpu to figure out where everything goes like
[01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:04.660]  We take it for granted now that our phones can like
[01:49:04.820 --> 01:49:07.700]  You know reload a web page and have it come up in like two or three seconds
[01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:13.460]  But most of that now is isn't even just networking advantages. It's the fact that the cpu is so much faster
[01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:19.780]  Yeah, it's I mean you just got to watch this thing like it is so good. It is just virtual
[01:49:19.780 --> 01:49:25.720]  It's virtuoso. It really is i'm so glad you remembered to call that out because it really was and it was a great twitter conversation
[01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:30.580]  Well, I was looking at I was looking at iphone. I was just like looking at iphone prices to see you know, because the
[01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:36.420]  The 10s max max that's like 1400 dollars, right? Yeah 14. I was like looking at the chart and I was like
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:38.580]  199
[01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:40.580]  and I ended up like
[01:49:41.380 --> 01:49:47.940]  And like obviously the carrier deals were actually far worse. Yes. Yeah. It's like a totally different situation and
[01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:54.740]  But like he put up the slide. It's like 199. I was like that slide is long gone. Like we're never seeing that again
[01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:59.460]  Can I tell you one more behind the scenes tidbit from the event last week was uh?
[01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:02.020]  I was I was
[01:50:02.020 --> 01:50:07.060]  Sitting uh next to a friend of the show and oftentimes guest dan frohmer from recode
[01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:11.780]  And we were towards the back. We were in the center but towards the back and there were a lot of
[01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:17.380]  Press people from asia around us and I think they were mostly from china. I mean, I honestly don't know but
[01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:22.820]  And and there was a weird thing going on at at first where
[01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:28.500]  I would say for the first 30 minutes of the apple event where apple had provided
[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:31.380]  asian language
[01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:35.860]  Press I don't know if this is new or if they've done it before but like earpieces where they could get like oh, yeah
[01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:42.660]  Real-time translation, but they were turned up way too loud and so a lot of these a lot of the people had taken them out
[01:50:42.660 --> 01:50:48.500]  Of their ears and were just sort of holding them because it was so loud that they didn't but that meant that like I could hear
[01:50:48.660 --> 01:50:50.660]  This sort of muffled
[01:50:51.060 --> 01:50:56.900]  I I thought that it was at first I thought it was people like listening to something on their phone with the speaker on and I
[01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:59.700]  Was like this is incredibly rude. Why are you doing this?
[01:50:59.700 --> 01:51:04.500]  I'm hearing but it was these earpieces and then apple I guess realized that it was too loud
[01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:10.340]  I guess realized that it was too loud and turned it down and but you know about halfway through or maybe like 30 minutes through it
[01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:12.340]  Stopped being a problem
[01:51:12.340 --> 01:51:13.700]  But I was surrounded, you know
[01:51:13.700 --> 01:51:18.820]  But I because of that I realized I was there was a lot of asian language press around us when they announced the prices
[01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:20.740]  of the iphone 10s
[01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:22.260]  in the event
[01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:24.260]  They there were gasps
[01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:25.380]  like
[01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:30.740]  Because I guess that there were rumors there there were so many rumors that the iphone 10s
[01:51:30.740 --> 01:51:38.260]  pricing last year was a one-off, you know that this was an anomaly to you know that they've so, you know shipped this
[01:51:38.900 --> 01:51:40.900]  Quote-unquote phone from the future, you know
[01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:46.980]  But that it would go back to where it used to be where the high-end phone started like seven hundred dollars or something like that
[01:51:47.220 --> 01:51:52.500]  When they announced that these phones started at 999 and that the 10s max started at eleven hundred dollars
[01:51:53.220 --> 01:51:57.780]  Uh, there were gasps. I mean just outright like shock it was
[01:51:57.780 --> 01:51:59.220]  Is
[01:51:59.220 --> 01:52:05.940]  It was the sort of gasp that you would expect if phil schiller had said and the default wallpaper is a nudie picture
[01:52:08.340 --> 01:52:14.660]  Wow, I didn't get that oh it was it but it was only because they were like the two rows behind me were just filled with
[01:52:14.820 --> 01:52:16.100]  uh
[01:52:16.100 --> 01:52:22.100]  I I think chinese but and and I it it just was so clear to me that they had bought hook line and sinker into
[01:52:22.100 --> 01:52:26.260]  The argument that that the phone prices were going to go back down this year and they they did not
[01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:28.260]  That's it. Well also
[01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:32.820]  Doing you can get a kick-ass phone in china for like 400 bucks
[01:52:33.940 --> 01:52:35.220]  right, so like
[01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:37.220]  It's way we actually sent um
[01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:42.900]  Ben popper he now works for dji, but we sent him when he was a reporter for us. We sent him to china
[01:52:43.460 --> 01:52:47.620]  um to go report on dji as it happens, um, and
[01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:53.060]  He texted me from like a store in shenzen. He was like what phone do you want?
[01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:57.380]  He's like this dude is just going to be on the phone. Like do you want an iphone body running android?
[01:52:57.380 --> 01:52:59.540]  Do you want this weird ass copy of ios like?
[01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:02.340]  that market is like
[01:53:02.340 --> 01:53:05.780]  It's incredible. Uh, so I think that those prices are really high and I think
[01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:08.340]  I don't know that's a whole other conversation
[01:53:08.340 --> 01:53:11.380]  Well, and then the other thing I know we got to wrap up but the other thing too though
[01:53:11.380 --> 01:53:17.380]  Is that the way that apple staged the show watch first then the 10s and then the 10r?
[01:53:17.380 --> 01:53:21.700]  So instead of doing the best or or better and then best they went best
[01:53:21.700 --> 01:53:23.700]  they went best and then
[01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:27.300]  But it makes sense given how good the 10r is that they you know
[01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:31.460]  They can just say it has the same grade a12. We already told you about same great wide angle camera blah blah
[01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:33.220]  Yeah, it makes sense
[01:53:33.220 --> 01:53:39.300]  And it is back in line with what people expect from iphone pricing for a brand new generation
[01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:43.300]  but so that the the the gasps at the 10s pricing
[01:53:43.940 --> 01:53:45.380]  I think were
[01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:49.700]  Exacerbate or lessened after the 10r pricing was unveiled
[01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:54.180]  Half an hour later. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's a good setup, right? You know, it's just a cheap one
[01:53:54.180 --> 01:53:58.340]  Yeah. All right. So we're gonna have to do this again when the 10r comes out. I think is the end of this conversation. Yeah
[01:53:59.060 --> 01:54:05.460]  Definitely. That's what I say. All right. Thank you. Nilay. I really appreciate it and uh, have a good weekend. Thanks, man
[01:54:05.460 --> 01:54:20.100]  Thanks, man. Love you on the show. All right
