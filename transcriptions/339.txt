[00:00.000 --> 00:02.880]  Ken Kishenda, welcome to the talk show. You're overdue.
[00:04.640 --> 00:07.760]  A little bit. By how many years would you make it out to be?
[00:07.760 --> 00:11.360]  Your book? Let me actually check the copyright date. 2018.
[00:11.360 --> 00:14.800]  So what time of the year in 2018 did creative selection come out?
[00:16.480 --> 00:20.480]  It was September the third or fourth, as I recall.
[00:20.480 --> 00:25.680]  So what, three plus years late. Because, and I call the show the talk show,
[00:25.680 --> 00:31.520]  and I like to think it is like a real talk show, but the whole point of actual,
[00:31.520 --> 00:36.240]  most actual talk shows is that when you have a guest with something to promote,
[00:36.240 --> 00:39.680]  if it's on the Stephen Colbert show or something like that, and there's a movie,
[00:39.680 --> 00:44.640]  they'll have the actor come out right before or right when the movie first hits theaters.
[00:45.680 --> 00:50.240]  That would have made my publisher really happy, I can say. The bright side of that,
[00:50.240 --> 00:55.840]  I tell you though, the bright side of the publisher was very happy with you because your
[00:56.880 --> 01:04.080]  link to the book was by far the best publicity that the book had.
[01:04.080 --> 01:10.080]  There was a huge bump in pre-orders right after you linked. And to tell you a funny story about
[01:10.080 --> 01:16.320]  that is that I didn't know that was going to happen. And my wife and I were in the car.
[01:16.320 --> 01:22.400]  We were driving down the coast towards Santa Barbara for just a weekend getaway.
[01:22.400 --> 01:26.400]  And maybe we can look back at the date. Maybe it was a Friday or a Saturday or something like that.
[01:27.040 --> 01:30.960]  So we were going into a part where I was going to lose cell phone coverage.
[01:30.960 --> 01:34.400]  And I wasn't looking at my phone anyway, because my wife and I were
[01:34.400 --> 01:38.800]  enjoying the conversation, enjoying our company, enjoying the beautiful scenery.
[01:38.800 --> 01:45.280]  And then you link to my book. It's, oh, holy cow, wait a minute. I got to look at it.
[01:45.280 --> 01:50.320]  I got to read this, what he said, and then be looking at what the feedback would be.
[01:50.320 --> 01:54.960]  And then it's like the cell phone coverage dropped out from the hour.
[01:54.960 --> 01:59.200]  And it was a pretty agonizing hour, not knowing what was going on in the virtual
[01:59.200 --> 02:03.040]  world when all of this beautiful scenery was going by in the real world.
[02:03.040 --> 02:05.440]  And I couldn't pay attention to it. Thanks for that, John.
[02:06.080 --> 02:10.560]  I don't know. I don't know what I'm not quite sure what to say.
[02:10.560 --> 02:15.280]  But I cannot explain it. The way my mind works is inscrutable.
[02:15.280 --> 02:21.040]  And I really did plan on having you on the show shortly after before around when the book came out
[02:21.040 --> 02:26.560]  and somehow felt overwhelmed because the book and I really am not I'm not just saying this
[02:26.560 --> 02:31.040]  because you're on the show right now. But I partly it was because the book is so good.
[02:31.840 --> 02:35.680]  And I didn't even know where to start. And I'm going to tell you,
[02:35.680 --> 02:39.840]  here we are three and a half years later, I still don't quite know where to start.
[02:39.840 --> 02:44.240]  But based on the piece I just published last night that I'd been working on for a while,
[02:44.240 --> 02:47.200]  let's let me just take my best stab right now at
[02:47.760 --> 02:52.000]  delineating the origin of the iPhone and putting it into a timeline.
[02:52.000 --> 02:52.500]  Go.
[02:53.520 --> 02:59.200]  And I your tweets in response to the stuff that I you know, it started a month ago.
[02:59.200 --> 03:02.720]  I'm assuming most people listening to this read my piece or at least
[03:02.720 --> 03:05.920]  follow Daring Fireball close enough that they saw it because it was pretty big.
[03:05.920 --> 03:11.440]  But basically, a month ago, there was a story came out about Facebook having two competing
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.960]  VRXR OS's for years with hundreds of people working on this other one
[03:16.960 --> 03:18.960]  and then pulled the plug on it late last year.
[03:19.520 --> 03:24.480]  And the executive in charge of it left to go to Google to head up AR VRXR.
[03:24.480 --> 03:29.360]  And I offhandedly a short post on Daring Fireball compared it to the
[03:29.360 --> 03:34.720]  famed bake off at Apple in the early days of the iPhone project between
[03:34.720 --> 03:40.560]  sort of a ground up Linux embedded OS sort of thing to make a phone versus
[03:40.560 --> 03:46.800]  what we now know as iOS famously a sort of let's take Mac OS 10 and strip it down to
[03:46.800 --> 03:52.160]  make something new that both performance wise can run on a tiny little cell phone of
[03:52.960 --> 03:59.280]  2006 2007 era hardware, which would be a hell of a thing to do with Mac OS 10 at the time,
[03:59.280 --> 04:02.800]  and redo the whole UI to work with this new metaphor.
[04:02.800 --> 04:05.600]  Long story short, we all know how it turned out.
[04:05.600 --> 04:10.880]  But it was anyway, my linking to it was a bad comparison and we could start there.
[04:10.880 --> 04:18.640]  I think it's not all that bad because how many operating systems get started at all
[04:18.640 --> 04:22.960]  at companies that could realistically finish it.
[04:23.920 --> 04:30.960]  And so it was an interesting story and an interesting occurrence at Facebook.
[04:30.960 --> 04:36.800]  Obviously, they bet the whole at least the whole name of the company on
[04:36.800 --> 04:40.560]  on a future that is different than their past.
[04:41.200 --> 04:47.760]  And Facebook just being an app and their future maybe being something more like a platform
[04:47.760 --> 04:51.280]  kind of makes sense that you would want your own operating system.
[04:51.280 --> 04:56.000]  And so the change in the direction of that is interesting.
[04:56.000 --> 05:01.920]  There is this story that maybe we're going to get to the bottom of it a little bit more
[05:01.920 --> 05:06.400]  given your looking into it and maybe some of the stories that I can tell.
[05:06.400 --> 05:12.000]  But I think it's a perfectly interesting and valid analogy or maybe and maybe that's
[05:12.000 --> 05:15.680]  an analogy that it's maybe less of a comparison and more of a contrast.
[05:15.680 --> 05:16.480]  Right.
[05:16.480 --> 05:21.840]  But maybe I can thank you because that's what then led to us talking right then.
[05:21.840 --> 05:23.840]  I can't think you really too much.
[05:23.840 --> 05:26.400]  But I do think it is an interesting comparison.
[05:26.400 --> 05:31.200]  And it would be interesting if you could find people someday to come on and talk to you
[05:31.200 --> 05:37.920]  about the effort that went on inside Facebook matter, what led to their decision being what
[05:37.920 --> 05:42.320]  it is, particularly if meta turns out to be as successful as the iPhone was.
[05:42.320 --> 05:43.440]  Yeah, maybe here.
[05:43.440 --> 05:47.920]  Let me just take a break, though, before we get rolling and figure out how we're going
[05:47.920 --> 05:48.640]  to do this.
[05:48.640 --> 05:52.400]  Let me take a break right here and thank our first sponsor.
[05:52.400 --> 05:54.960]  And it is our good friends at Remote.
[05:55.760 --> 05:58.960]  Do you employ or pay workers in other countries?
[05:58.960 --> 06:00.880]  Even if you don't yet, you might soon.
[06:00.880 --> 06:05.760]  Now that remote work is the norm, employees have more freedom than ever to move around.
[06:05.760 --> 06:08.800]  If you want to keep your best people, you want to hire the best people, you have to
[06:08.800 --> 06:09.760]  stay flexible.
[06:09.760 --> 06:16.800]  That's why remote makes it easy for companies of all sizes to employ global teams.
[06:16.800 --> 06:21.760]  They take care of international payroll benefits, taxes, and local compliance so you can focus
[06:21.760 --> 06:26.320]  less on paperwork and bureaucracy and more on growing your business.
[06:26.320 --> 06:31.600]  Remote helps you onboard full time employees or contractors in countries all over the world
[06:31.600 --> 06:34.000]  in minutes on its simple, easy to use platform.
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.960]  Even better, remote lets you rest easy by providing the most comprehensive intellectual
[06:38.960 --> 06:41.920]  property protections and data security in the industry.
[06:41.920 --> 06:46.960]  They own full legal local entities in all their covered countries, guaranteeing you
[06:46.960 --> 06:49.280]  never have to deal with a third party ever.
[06:49.280 --> 06:54.800]  You just deal with remote. To save you money, remote never charges any fees or salary percentages.
[06:54.800 --> 06:59.360]  You get access to everything remote offers from payroll to compliance to benefits management
[06:59.360 --> 07:03.360]  for one low flat rate, no hidden fees, no surprises ever.
[07:03.360 --> 07:06.400]  Just the best global employment solution in the business.
[07:06.400 --> 07:10.480]  Best of all, listeners to this show, the talk show, get an even bigger discount.
[07:10.480 --> 07:15.760]  You get 50% off Remote's full suite of global employment solutions for your first employee
[07:15.760 --> 07:22.080]  for three months. Just visit remote.com slash the talk show.
[07:22.080 --> 07:28.560]  That's remote.com slash the talk show and use that promo code the talk show 50% off
[07:28.560 --> 07:30.400]  your first employee for three months.
[07:30.400 --> 07:35.520]  See why top global companies like GitLab trust remote to manage and pay their international
[07:35.520 --> 07:35.920]  teams.
[07:35.920 --> 07:39.680]  Whether you want to hire one person or 100, remote makes it easy.
[07:39.680 --> 07:45.520]  Just go to remote.com slash the talk show and remember that promo code the talk show.
[07:45.520 --> 07:50.240]  Uh, we can talk about remote work later too.
[07:50.240 --> 07:53.760]  That's been in the news with Apple and is an interesting comparison.
[07:53.760 --> 07:54.960]  Oh, for sure.
[07:54.960 --> 08:02.560]  Particularly given my great preference to work in person with people and trying to balance
[08:02.560 --> 08:07.200]  that out, given how the world has changed over the last couple of years.
[08:07.200 --> 08:11.680]  Even just today, I was, and it's a Saturday that we're recording.
[08:11.680 --> 08:18.160]  I went in extra to spend some time with Imran Chaudhry, my colleague, and he's one of the
[08:18.160 --> 08:21.040]  co-founders at the company I'm working on now.
[08:21.040 --> 08:26.240]  And that's about all that I'm going to be able to say about what I'm doing at humane.
[08:28.080 --> 08:33.600]  That could be maybe a future topic for another visit with the factor of how long it would
[08:33.600 --> 08:36.880]  take me to have the, have you invite me back on.
[08:36.880 --> 08:40.000]  I can't maybe really speculate how long that would be.
[08:40.000 --> 08:43.520]  Uh, but we have plenty to talk about now.
[08:43.520 --> 08:47.600]  I'd never known about it, the future, but the past, what could I tell you about the
[08:47.600 --> 08:50.240]  book or maybe even the process of writing the book?
[08:50.240 --> 08:55.040]  I mean, one of the things I wanted to ask you about is that you're a writer.
[08:55.040 --> 09:01.280]  What is your idea about whether you might write a book of your own someday or is it
[09:01.280 --> 09:02.640]  just daring fireball?
[09:02.640 --> 09:08.320]  Is there something about the format, the kind of blogging format that just fits you better
[09:08.320 --> 09:10.320]  as opposed to something more long form?
[09:10.320 --> 09:11.520]  That's a tough question.
[09:11.520 --> 09:15.920]  I mean, I've obviously thought about it, but one of the things I wanted to, and rereading
[09:15.920 --> 09:21.520]  your book and revisiting all of this, which now, you know, let's face it, it's history,
[09:21.520 --> 09:21.760]  right?
[09:21.760 --> 09:26.960]  And it's like, you get to a certain age and I swear this digression is going somewhere,
[09:26.960 --> 09:33.520]  but when you're young, let's just say right out of college, 22, 23, around that age, when
[09:33.520 --> 09:39.120]  you think about things that happened 20 years before that, it feels like ancient history.
[09:39.120 --> 09:43.920]  And even if you were technically alive, like for me, like Nixon resigning from the presidency,
[09:43.920 --> 09:46.640]  and I was like, I don't know, one and a half years old.
[09:46.640 --> 09:51.680]  It happened in my lifetime, but it feels, I don't know, it felt like true history, like
[09:51.680 --> 09:58.640]  history with a capital H, not like lived history, you know, and you hear about things like the
[09:58.640 --> 10:04.080]  creation of Unix and like, why did they pick 1971 as the epoch date for time?
[10:04.080 --> 10:08.560]  It's because that's like when they first had it running and it's like, sure, in 1991,
[10:08.560 --> 10:13.840]  that was 20 years ago, but the original version of Unix felt like ancient computer history
[10:13.840 --> 10:14.960]  20 years prior.
[10:14.960 --> 10:22.320]  But now here I am in my late 40s and it feels like stuff that happened 20 years ago.
[10:22.320 --> 10:27.600]  I know it wasn't recent, but boy, it sure feels more relevant than it did.
[10:27.600 --> 10:33.360]  And so here, so here I am in the 20th year, going into the 20th year later this year of
[10:33.360 --> 10:36.240]  writing Daring Fireball and the.
[10:37.040 --> 10:39.360]  Wow, that's, that's an amazing milestone.
[10:39.360 --> 10:40.080]  Congratulations.
[10:40.080 --> 10:41.760]  Well, congratulate me when I get there.
[10:41.760 --> 10:43.200]  And I've never won.
[10:43.200 --> 10:48.800]  I think I've only even commemorated one anniversary, I think the 15th or something on Daring Fireball.
[10:48.800 --> 10:51.760]  I'm not one to make a show of stuff like that.
[10:51.760 --> 10:55.440]  I, not out of, it's not that I'm overly humble.
[10:55.440 --> 11:00.720]  It's just like an innate sense of that Steve Jobs axiom.
[11:00.720 --> 11:04.480]  And I'm sure he'll come up more times here, but that's sort of, if you do something good,
[11:04.480 --> 11:05.600]  take a moment to appreciate it.
[11:05.600 --> 11:08.880]  And I'm paraphrasing here, but move on to the next thing and make something else.
[11:08.880 --> 11:09.520]  That's good.
[11:09.520 --> 11:12.160]  It's, you know, that's, that's right.
[11:12.160 --> 11:16.960]  As a matter of fact, that, that quotation, at least when I worked on the infinite loop
[11:17.520 --> 11:22.800]  campus for all the years that I did 15, more than 15 years, certainly in the later part,
[11:22.800 --> 11:28.960]  maybe Evos even after his passing, that that quote that you're mentioning was painted up
[11:28.960 --> 11:33.840]  on the wall outside of the town hall, the on-campus auditorium.
[11:33.840 --> 11:42.880]  I mean, really quite famously, Steve was uninterested in the past and certainly uninterested
[11:42.880 --> 11:44.480]  in reveling in the past.
[11:44.480 --> 11:51.280]  I remember when I joined Apple in June of 2001, I worked on the infinite loop campus
[11:51.280 --> 11:52.880]  in Cupertino in building two.
[11:53.600 --> 11:59.920]  And on the second floor, there was a miniature next museum.
[11:59.920 --> 12:02.800]  There was some, some next hardware.
[12:02.800 --> 12:07.600]  There was a cube and a slab and then some sun hardware.
[12:07.600 --> 12:11.920]  I think that was running a next step once next got out of the business of making its
[12:11.920 --> 12:15.040]  own hardware and making software for other platforms.
[12:15.040 --> 12:17.760]  So there was maybe six or eight machines there.
[12:18.560 --> 12:20.160]  And of course this was 2001.
[12:20.160 --> 12:26.320]  So Steve had been back at Apple for years by that point, but not long after that, the
[12:26.320 --> 12:30.480]  word came down, nope, that stuff is just getting bundled up and sent off.
[12:30.480 --> 12:36.480]  I either send it to the computer history museum in Mountain View, just close by, or I think
[12:36.480 --> 12:41.360]  maybe as I'm thinking about it now, somebody at Stanford took it, but he was just like,
[12:41.360 --> 12:42.480]  clean that stuff out.
[12:42.480 --> 12:44.560]  We're making new things.
[12:44.560 --> 12:46.880]  Just don't worry about the past.
[12:46.880 --> 12:52.560]  These computers running this ancient software with little cards and what place does that
[12:52.560 --> 13:01.760]  have in a company that is focused on innovating and making new products that are going to
[13:01.760 --> 13:10.080]  at that point and trying to dig Apple out of a hole of having only 5% market share in
[13:10.080 --> 13:11.440]  desktop computing them.
[13:11.440 --> 13:18.000]  And thinking about that from the point from June of 2001, it was only four months later
[13:18.640 --> 13:21.760]  that the iPod was announced.
[13:21.760 --> 13:28.960]  And that was in some ways the real solution, the real jumping off point for Apple.
[13:28.960 --> 13:35.120]  The moment where Apple ceased to be what it was and started being what it has become.
[13:35.120 --> 13:41.840]  New products, new platforms, and a whole different order of success.
[13:41.840 --> 13:43.040]  I have the quote in front of me.
[13:43.040 --> 13:46.880]  I think if you do something, this is from Steve Jobs, I think if you do something and
[13:46.880 --> 13:51.200]  it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell
[13:51.200 --> 13:52.400]  on it for too long.
[13:52.400 --> 13:54.160]  Just figure out what's next.
[13:54.160 --> 13:56.960]  I believe that's the part of the quote that's on the wall.
[13:56.960 --> 14:00.640]  Last time I was at town hall for a media event, it was certainly still there.
[14:00.640 --> 14:02.320]  I certainly can't believe they'll take that down.
[14:02.320 --> 14:05.760]  But I don't know what they use town hall for anymore.
[14:05.760 --> 14:10.160]  COVID restrictions aside, media events are now on the new campus.
[14:10.160 --> 14:14.720]  It's never going to stop seeming weird to me that the old campus was infinite loop and
[14:14.720 --> 14:17.200]  the new campus is a building that's a loop.
[14:17.840 --> 14:19.680]  But so I always want to say infinite.
[14:19.680 --> 14:20.720]  Well, there there.
[14:20.720 --> 14:22.080]  Yeah, I mean, there is a loop.
[14:22.080 --> 14:23.200]  I mean, of six buildings.
[14:23.200 --> 14:25.920]  I mean, I wish I had a count.
[14:25.920 --> 14:30.400]  I wish I had a nickel for every time that during the day and either solving, you know,
[14:30.400 --> 14:34.960]  trying to work through a hard problem that I did laps around the outside of that loop.
[14:34.960 --> 14:37.280]  Yeah, it is aptly aptly named.
[14:37.280 --> 14:42.320]  It was really a beautiful place to spend 15 years of my working career, for sure.
[14:42.320 --> 14:50.480]  But that quote really does sum up so much of the culture that Steve tried to bring to
[14:50.480 --> 14:54.880]  Apple, that people like me, you know, an individual contributor, never, never a big
[14:54.880 --> 15:00.400]  executive, never really spent that much time with Steve, although I did a couple of times.
[15:00.400 --> 15:05.840]  And as I tried to write in my book that those few times affected me very greatly, had a
[15:05.840 --> 15:09.840]  huge influence on the way that I did my work.
[15:09.840 --> 15:14.560]  And so quotes like that, it's part of the culture, it's part of the lore, it's part
[15:14.560 --> 15:21.360]  of what we were shooting for, part of what inspired me to do the work that I did on the
[15:21.360 --> 15:22.640]  products we were trying to make.
[15:22.640 --> 15:24.240]  Yeah, it definitely expresses its sentiments.
[15:24.240 --> 15:29.520]  The other thing I know that I think it was Steve Jobs who got rid of was the icon garden.
[15:29.520 --> 15:36.240]  They had some of the original Mac, like 1984 icons somewhere in Infinite Loop, not really
[15:36.240 --> 15:40.320]  sculptures, but two dimensional things stuck in the grass, and they got rid of them.
[15:40.320 --> 15:44.560]  Yeah, so they got rid of those things, the numbers outside of the building are the last
[15:44.560 --> 15:45.520]  vestige of that.
[15:45.520 --> 15:47.360]  They never replaced those.
[15:47.360 --> 15:55.200]  But even back in 2001, you'd go into the reception area of Infinite Loop 2, and then
[15:55.200 --> 16:02.400]  there was a glass door, a set of glass doors that I mean, you've probably seen them, John,
[16:02.400 --> 16:05.040]  but other visitors will have as well.
[16:05.040 --> 16:10.960]  But the glass right at around maybe chest level had some stenciling on the glass of
[16:10.960 --> 16:14.000]  those old one bit icons.
[16:14.000 --> 16:21.120]  And yeah, maybe 2002, 2003, you just come in one morning and that day they were scraped
[16:21.120 --> 16:22.480]  off and never put back.
[16:22.480 --> 16:29.920]  Again, not focusing too much on the glorious past, but trying to make a better future.
[16:29.920 --> 16:32.160]  I don't want to keep moving on.
[16:32.160 --> 16:32.880]  We can do this.
[16:32.880 --> 16:35.200]  We can talk about you writing your book next.
[16:35.200 --> 16:36.480]  First, starting.
[16:36.480 --> 16:39.520]  Dodge the question of, do I think I have a book or books in me?
[16:39.520 --> 16:44.560]  Where I was going is I always thought maybe, and let's put aside the idea of best of collection
[16:44.560 --> 16:47.440]  from Daring Fireball, which is sort of a cop out, right?
[16:47.440 --> 16:48.640]  You can put that in a book.
[16:48.640 --> 16:52.320]  It might, people might enjoy it as a book, but that's not writing a book.
[16:52.320 --> 16:54.400]  That is that it's a different thing.
[16:54.400 --> 17:02.320]  So I've always had the idea and it always, in some self-effacing way, felt like real
[17:02.320 --> 17:05.760]  writers are book writers and not real writers.
[17:05.760 --> 17:12.240]  That's even too dismissive, but for whatever reason, I've always, even before Daring Fireball
[17:12.800 --> 17:22.000]  became a thing, I always felt like a columnist is the scope of my aptitude.
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.920]  And it's not Stephen King whose book on writing is one of the best writing books I have ever
[17:27.920 --> 17:28.400]  read.
[17:28.400 --> 17:31.600]  One of his things though, is that if you don't have time to read, you don't have time to
[17:31.600 --> 17:31.840]  write.
[17:31.840 --> 17:33.520]  You have to read to be a writer.
[17:33.520 --> 17:39.360]  And I read voraciously, of course, and I do read, I read a tremendous more amount of short
[17:39.360 --> 17:45.280]  form writing on news and stuff like that, stuff that I link to, then I do read books
[17:45.280 --> 17:48.160]  and I read fewer books than I used to.
[17:48.160 --> 17:54.160]  And I can't explain why, and I feel a little guilty about it, but long story short, I don't
[17:54.160 --> 17:54.320]  know.
[17:54.320 --> 17:55.440]  I don't know if I have it in me.
[17:55.440 --> 17:55.840]  I don't know.
[17:56.400 --> 18:00.000]  And I guess the big thing is that whenever I do write something, it's because I feel
[18:00.000 --> 18:03.440]  like I've got this idea in my head and I need to get it out.
[18:03.440 --> 18:07.360]  And one of Stephen King's analogies is that all of the things he's written, he imagines
[18:07.360 --> 18:10.640]  them as like fossils in the sand or in the dirt.
[18:10.640 --> 18:12.400]  Writing is like digging out the fossil.
[18:12.400 --> 18:16.560]  He doesn't know how big it is because it's in the ground, and then he digs it out.
[18:16.560 --> 18:19.760]  And of course, for Stephen King, a lot of these are like 500-page novels.
[18:20.720 --> 18:25.040]  I feel the same way though about articles that I wrote, like the one I wrote on the
[18:25.040 --> 18:26.240]  origin of the iPhone.
[18:26.240 --> 18:27.600]  So I've got to write this.
[18:27.600 --> 18:29.040]  I don't know how long it's going to take me.
[18:29.040 --> 18:30.240]  I don't know how long it's going to be.
[18:30.240 --> 18:31.280]  Is it a thousand words?
[18:31.280 --> 18:32.800]  Is it 3,000 words?
[18:32.800 --> 18:34.400]  Is it somewhere in between?
[18:34.400 --> 18:34.880]  I don't know.
[18:34.880 --> 18:39.600]  I just have never started digging on an idea where it feels like this is a 60,000-word
[18:40.320 --> 18:41.680]  book broken into chapters.
[18:41.680 --> 18:45.680]  But maybe I approach it wrong, and I would love to know the way you approached your book,
[18:45.680 --> 18:53.760]  is maybe I shouldn't think about writing a book, but instead think about an idea for
[18:53.760 --> 18:59.440]  a book that is composed of chapters, and chapters are more like articles, which is what I write,
[18:59.440 --> 19:04.400]  and think more about the practicality of writing chapters as opposed to just sitting down,
[19:04.400 --> 19:05.680]  start to finish writing a book.
[19:05.680 --> 19:11.920]  I, to go back to Stephen King, I found his book extraordinarily helpful.
[19:11.920 --> 19:19.440]  To those of you listening who are unfamiliar with the book, it's wonderful, highly recommended.
[19:19.440 --> 19:22.160]  The first, and he breaks it up into two parts.
[19:22.160 --> 19:24.960]  The first part of the book is autobiographical.
[19:24.960 --> 19:31.200]  He tells the story of how he, but really more almost like a memoir, because he doesn't,
[19:31.200 --> 19:38.320]  from start to finish, tell the story of his life, but tells enough of his earlier life
[19:38.320 --> 19:47.920]  to understand how it is that he became a writer, and how it was something similar to this fossil
[19:47.920 --> 19:50.160]  analogy that he uncovered.
[19:50.160 --> 19:51.760]  In some ways, he couldn't help himself.
[19:51.760 --> 19:57.120]  And so, it can have been some respects, it really is the right job for him.
[19:57.120 --> 20:05.200]  And he also did address the subject matter that he uses as his raw material for his writing.
[20:06.400 --> 20:17.520]  And how, for a long time, he felt that there was something either cheap or coarse around
[20:18.080 --> 20:20.080]  writing the sorts of books that he did.
[20:20.080 --> 20:26.320]  He almost felt sorry for it, sorry about it, felt that he needed to apologize.
[20:26.320 --> 20:31.360]  And he said, you know, he said that it was really later on in his life that it's just
[20:31.360 --> 20:33.360]  like, hey, now look, this is what I have.
[20:34.160 --> 20:39.760]  This is what, when he turns his mind toward being creative, this is what just comes out.
[20:40.480 --> 20:46.880]  And, you know, and I think that in some ways that is, that that's the answer for you.
[20:46.880 --> 20:54.800]  I mean, look, Daring Fireball is something that probably I have read every day since
[20:54.800 --> 20:59.120]  you, since I discovered it shortly after you started writing it.
[20:59.120 --> 21:04.000]  And so, sort of second guessing yourself on what you should write, you know, seems to
[21:04.000 --> 21:07.280]  me not to be a question really worth thinking about.
[21:07.280 --> 21:12.880]  For as long as there's something that comes along that you say you have to do, it's like
[21:12.880 --> 21:17.040]  you have to write this story on the origin of the iPhone, then you're probably doing
[21:17.040 --> 21:18.240]  as well as you can.
[21:18.240 --> 21:23.280]  I mean, you know, if you can find inspiration in things and there's something that's
[21:23.280 --> 21:28.880]  going to get you out of bed in the morning and work creatively, then, you know, who's
[21:28.880 --> 21:30.640]  anybody to second guess what that is?
[21:30.640 --> 21:32.000]  I don't worry about it.
[21:32.000 --> 21:33.920]  I've never felt too bad about it.
[21:33.920 --> 21:35.600]  My dad seems to want me to write a book.
[21:35.600 --> 21:37.520]  I'm glad he doesn't listen to the podcast.
[21:37.520 --> 21:40.560]  But it's sort of like, you know, I tell this story.
[21:40.560 --> 21:45.120]  I've told it often where my dad has always been very supportive, both my parents, very
[21:45.120 --> 21:48.320]  supportive of what I do, but they don't really get it.
[21:48.320 --> 21:52.320]  They don't, you know, I've been doing it enough years now that they trust me now and
[21:52.320 --> 21:53.680]  they see that I'm successful.
[21:54.320 --> 21:58.400]  But in the early years, they really didn't get it because the web is just not of the,
[21:58.400 --> 22:02.160]  I mean, they go to the web, but this just never seems as real to them.
[22:02.160 --> 22:06.800]  At some point, several years into writing, they're like, okay, I'm going to write a
[22:06.800 --> 22:07.680]  book.
[22:07.680 --> 22:11.680]  And then several years into writing during Fireball, I got to start writing occasional
[22:11.680 --> 22:19.920]  back page columns for Macworld, which for Apple punditry was always the, you know, that,
[22:19.920 --> 22:22.080]  that's the, that's the prime spot, right?
[22:22.080 --> 22:27.760]  There's only one back page column on Macworld and Macworld was always the sort of, you
[22:27.760 --> 22:28.800]  know, the gold standard of Mac.
[22:28.800 --> 22:30.000]  Oh, it's very prestigious.
[22:30.000 --> 22:30.560]  Sure.
[22:31.440 --> 22:36.160]  And it, it, it really, really impressed my dad.
[22:36.160 --> 22:39.840]  He was in his eyes blown away, like, oh, and I'm thinking like, I should have bought more
[22:39.840 --> 22:43.120]  copies of this for him, for him, you know?
[22:43.120 --> 22:47.600]  But like, like my wife said afterwards, and my wife loves my dad, but she was just like,
[22:47.600 --> 22:50.560]  doesn't he understand that you've built something way better?
[22:50.560 --> 22:52.560]  You know, you know what I mean?
[22:52.560 --> 22:57.200]  Like building during Fireball by that time was more of an accomplishment than getting
[22:57.200 --> 23:01.600]  on the back page of Macworld, but being in print, I still do love print.
[23:01.600 --> 23:02.720]  I always will.
[23:02.720 --> 23:04.240]  And that sort of dates me.
[23:04.240 --> 23:08.080]  I I'm, you know, student newspaper guy coming up through college.
[23:08.080 --> 23:09.200]  I do love print.
[23:09.200 --> 23:10.480]  I love typography.
[23:10.480 --> 23:15.040]  I don't think typography ever looks as good on a glowing screen, no matter how many pixels
[23:15.040 --> 23:18.160]  it has than it does printed on paper.
[23:18.960 --> 23:19.440]  I love it.
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.160]  I love the tangibleness of it.
[23:22.160 --> 23:23.200]  I do love it.
[23:23.200 --> 23:26.880]  So, you know, never say never on me writing a book or collecting stuff into a book or
[23:26.880 --> 23:27.200]  something.
[23:27.200 --> 23:29.440]  I just said that to somebody on Twitter again today.
[23:29.440 --> 23:31.600]  Never say never, but I don't know.
[23:31.600 --> 23:41.200]  But I, yeah, I mean, it's finding the right medium for the message that you're trying
[23:41.200 --> 23:45.280]  to convey to people is, is a trick to me.
[23:45.280 --> 23:49.920]  I, I like having constraints.
[23:51.280 --> 23:59.600]  And when I left Apple in May of 2017, I didn't know what I was going to do.
[23:59.600 --> 24:10.640]  And as I was contemplating leaving, I had a friend get in touch and her name is Kim
[24:10.640 --> 24:11.040]  Scott.
[24:12.320 --> 24:19.680]  And she is the author of two books that have gotten some mindshare out of the world.
[24:19.680 --> 24:23.200]  Radical candor is one and just work is her more recent book.
[24:23.200 --> 24:29.120]  Uh, and right at that moment when I was really thinking about, well, what's, what's next
[24:29.120 --> 24:35.280]  for me, uh, writing her book, radical candor came out and she invited me to the book release
[24:35.280 --> 24:38.480]  party, which, uh, took place in Palo Alto.
[24:39.120 --> 24:47.360]  And so I wrote over there after work one evening and she introduced me to her editor and her
[24:47.360 --> 24:49.040]  editors, you know, started questioning me.
[24:49.040 --> 24:50.640]  Well, Hey, Ken, what are you doing?
[24:50.640 --> 24:53.360]  You know, maybe you should, uh, maybe you should write a book.
[24:53.360 --> 24:59.920]  And I found out later that Kim Scott, it was a total setup that she had been talking to
[24:59.920 --> 25:01.280]  her editor about.
[25:01.280 --> 25:02.160]  It really was.
[25:02.160 --> 25:02.800]  Blind days.
[25:02.800 --> 25:04.320]  It's a blind day set up.
[25:04.320 --> 25:08.320]  Yeah, it re it actually actually totally was.
[25:08.320 --> 25:12.400]  And fortunately, uh, the, the fellow, his name is Tim Bartley.
[25:12.400 --> 25:20.960]  He's an absolutely marvelous, marvelous editor and so smart, so, uh, so good at his job.
[25:21.920 --> 25:27.680]  And, uh, he said, well, you know, if you want to write a book, just send me a proposal.
[25:27.680 --> 25:29.200]  And I got the wheels turning.
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.560]  Uh, and you know, I'd really already decided, but not, not yet announced that I was going
[25:34.560 --> 25:36.160]  to be leaving shortly thereafter.
[25:36.160 --> 25:41.760]  And, uh, you know, it, it just kind of like all the planets aligned.
[25:41.760 --> 25:50.080]  So within just a few days of, of leaving, uh, Apple, I, I had sat down and started,
[25:50.080 --> 25:54.000]  uh, started keyboarding started, uh, didn't quite put pen to paper.
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.360]  I was, I, I did the whole thing electronically, but this gets me back to then, uh, Stephen
[25:59.360 --> 25:59.680]  King.
[25:59.680 --> 26:03.760]  The other thing I wanted to say about the other half, the second half of the on writing
[26:03.760 --> 26:09.680]  book, which is, uh, Stephen King's advice on how to do the job of writing.
[26:10.400 --> 26:18.800]  And again, he made it very personal related, uh, what he did and the, the, that whole section
[26:18.800 --> 26:22.560]  is, uh, and I have to say that I didn't actually read the book.
[26:22.560 --> 26:27.200]  I had Stephen King read it to me and he's a marvelous reader of his own material.
[26:27.760 --> 26:32.080]  So, uh, so he told me he came to your house or you listened to the audio book.
[26:32.080 --> 26:36.720]  No, no, I listened to the audio book.
[26:36.720 --> 26:37.760]  Um, all right.
[26:37.760 --> 26:40.320]  I just didn't, I wasn't, I just wasn't being unclear.
[26:40.320 --> 26:40.800]  No, no, no, no.
[26:40.800 --> 26:43.440]  I wasn't quite sure how I wasn't quite clear about that.
[26:43.440 --> 26:46.000]  I wasn't quite sure I had just how well you did at Apple.
[26:48.880 --> 26:50.080]  Not, not that.
[26:50.080 --> 26:56.000]  Well, I, I doubt sincerely, although Stephen King is an avid user of, of Apple products.
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.600]  I doubt very sincerely that he has, uh, ever, ever heard of me.
[26:59.600 --> 27:04.240]  Uh, but, uh, so I had the audio book to be perfectly clear.
[27:04.240 --> 27:09.680]  Uh, and, uh, so listening to him, he said that what he did, he had a process is that
[27:09.680 --> 27:12.480]  he wrote 2000 new words every day.
[27:12.480 --> 27:18.240]  He'd get up in the morning and he would set about putting those 2000 words down.
[27:19.120 --> 27:24.080]  And he said, well, you know, if, if he had a good day and, and the writing was easy,
[27:24.080 --> 27:30.240]  he finishes up at 10 AM and then he can go get a cup of coffee, have a walk, do some
[27:30.240 --> 27:30.720]  shopping.
[27:31.440 --> 27:32.000]  That's it.
[27:32.000 --> 27:32.720]  He's done.
[27:32.720 --> 27:36.160]  He satisfied his obligation and the pressure is off.
[27:37.440 --> 27:40.480]  Now, other times the writing is more difficult to do.
[27:40.480 --> 27:44.800]  And he says, you know, he's particularly as he started getting older, that he was still
[27:44.800 --> 27:50.880]  at work at four and five in the afternoon, but the goal was to set down 2000 new words
[27:50.880 --> 27:51.280]  a day.
[27:51.280 --> 27:55.680]  Right. And that seemed to be a really, uh, wonderful discipline.
[27:56.240 --> 28:01.440]  And so, like I said before, I like to have constraints and, and so I said, well, I'm
[28:01.440 --> 28:05.760]  not nearly as good as Stephen King, but I set myself the ambitious goal of writing a
[28:05.760 --> 28:06.960]  thousand new words a day.
[28:07.520 --> 28:11.040]  And, uh, and that's what I did seven days a week.
[28:11.600 --> 28:13.440]  Yeah, I wasn't working anymore.
[28:13.440 --> 28:17.520]  And so this was the job that actually worked out pretty well.
[28:17.520 --> 28:21.040]  Um, I actually have a spreadsheet, uh, on, on my machine.
[28:21.040 --> 28:26.720]  I don't have it up here now, but, uh, uh, I would write down every day, uh, how many,
[28:26.720 --> 28:28.400]  how many words I did.
[28:28.400 --> 28:31.360]  And it was, I was pretty good.
[28:32.000 --> 28:39.440]  And with, uh, within a hundred days, uh, I had about 110,000 words because sometimes
[28:39.440 --> 28:45.360]  I, you know, you kind of kept going and that formed the core of the whole, of the
[28:45.360 --> 28:46.000]  whole book.
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.560]  And, you know, the interest, you know, the part of it is that I kind of knew what I
[28:50.560 --> 28:51.520]  wanted to say.
[28:52.560 --> 29:00.080]  And so the writing was kind of easy because it was going back over my memory and trying
[29:00.080 --> 29:03.840]  to tell this firsthand account of what, what happened.
[29:03.840 --> 29:10.160]  So I, you know, I have a lot of sympathy in a way for you trying to write this story,
[29:10.160 --> 29:15.120]  like on the origin of the iPhone, because you're not just going back over your own
[29:15.120 --> 29:16.000]  memory.
[29:16.000 --> 29:22.000]  You're trying to disclose and uncover facts that either don't exist or are locked away
[29:22.000 --> 29:23.840]  in somebody else's memory.
[29:23.840 --> 29:27.840]  And you have to try to piece together all of these accounts.
[29:27.840 --> 29:32.960]  I didn't set myself that nearly as a difficult a task as that.
[29:32.960 --> 29:38.720]  In some ways I marvel at what you're able to do with this, with a story like that.
[29:38.720 --> 29:43.360]  How do you, you get this idea in your mind that you want to write this story on the origin
[29:43.360 --> 29:43.840]  of the iPhone.
[29:43.840 --> 29:45.440]  What do you do?
[29:45.440 --> 29:46.320]  Well, here, let me say this.
[29:46.320 --> 29:50.720]  Let me just go back before I forget while we're sticking our fingers and pages and going
[29:50.720 --> 29:52.720]  back to them as we continue forward.
[29:52.720 --> 29:58.480]  I did write a post when Daring Fireball turned 15 in August of 2017.
[29:58.480 --> 30:00.960]  And I ran, I don't think I mentioned this in the article.
[30:00.960 --> 30:05.360]  Now I will put this in the show notes, but my friend Jim Kudall had suggested I do this
[30:05.360 --> 30:06.960]  at some point when we had gotten together.
[30:06.960 --> 30:10.320]  Then he was just like, I wonder how many words you've written, you know, at Daring Fireball.
[30:10.320 --> 30:17.440]  So I wrote a little script to do a word count and it five years ago, I guess that would
[30:17.440 --> 30:18.880]  be four and a half years ago.
[30:18.880 --> 30:24.400]  I had written 1173 full columns.
[30:24.400 --> 30:31.680]  That's the full length articles and 25,486 link list entries where I linked to somebody
[30:31.680 --> 30:33.840]  else in the full columns.
[30:33.840 --> 30:39.200]  I had, and it's amazing how even it worked out 1,048,000 words.
[30:39.200 --> 30:45.520]  So let's call it a million, a million original words and 200,000 extra words that were in
[30:45.520 --> 30:46.240]  block quotes.
[30:46.240 --> 30:49.680]  So in other words, when I quote from somebody else in one of my articles, which I obviously,
[30:49.680 --> 30:53.760]  you know, anybody familiar with my style knows that's sort of fundamental to the whole
[30:53.760 --> 30:58.640]  format is a lot, but in the full articles, you know, a million original words, link list
[30:58.640 --> 31:02.640]  entries, 950,000 original words.
[31:02.640 --> 31:07.600]  But of course, in those entries, 2,000,000 total words, including block quotes.
[31:07.600 --> 31:14.400]  But that added up to two over just over literally, it was, I honestly did not plan this combined
[31:14.400 --> 31:19.520]  original words, 2,001,516.
[31:19.520 --> 31:22.240]  So just 2,000,000 on the button for 15 years.
[31:23.120 --> 31:24.000]  Sounds like a lot.
[31:24.000 --> 31:24.480]  And it did.
[31:24.480 --> 31:26.320]  It was, it was, it's sort of like a lot.
[31:26.320 --> 31:29.040]  It's sort of what made me like, okay, I'll publish it.
[31:29.040 --> 31:31.120]  I'll commemorate this milestone.
[31:31.120 --> 31:34.800]  But then you think about Stephen King's productivity.
[31:34.800 --> 31:38.960]  If he gets 2,000 a day, that's only a thousand days, like three.
[31:41.120 --> 31:42.080]  That's under three years.
[31:42.080 --> 31:47.840]  No, but I just look at my own bookshelf full of Stephen King novels and I don't have all
[31:47.840 --> 31:48.320]  of them.
[31:48.320 --> 31:51.120]  And there's only one Stephen King productivity wise.
[31:51.120 --> 31:52.800]  Well, look, he's special.
[31:52.800 --> 32:00.320]  I mean, obviously he has an incredible talent that and a genius for doing what he does.
[32:00.320 --> 32:04.640]  And so I, I don't seek to compare myself to him.
[32:04.640 --> 32:07.280]  How could I having written one?
[32:08.240 --> 32:08.720]  Let's see.
[32:09.920 --> 32:16.960]  It turned out to be 80,000 words in the final or in this version, I think it even got edited
[32:16.960 --> 32:22.240]  down something like 77,000 words in the final book is, is what I recall.
[32:22.240 --> 32:26.720]  I actually have this spreadsheet here and yeah, probably about two out of every three
[32:26.720 --> 32:29.360]  days I got to a thousand words.
[32:29.360 --> 32:32.880]  And so, you know, any aspiring writers out there, if you wanted to, you know, write a
[32:32.880 --> 32:38.240]  book of the magnitude of creative selection, you can do a thousand words a day.
[32:38.240 --> 32:39.600]  You could have it in three months.
[32:40.560 --> 32:46.000]  I mean, so it's just, it's, it's all, you know, kind of the, you know, the numbers game
[32:46.000 --> 32:51.200]  is one thing, but, you know, kind of figuring out what you want to say is, is, is, is another.
[32:51.200 --> 32:54.880]  I mean, so do you find the, do you find the writing process easy?
[32:54.880 --> 33:01.280]  I mean, what do you, you know, you say that you had this, this burning desire to, well,
[33:01.280 --> 33:02.480]  I don't want to put words in your math.
[33:02.480 --> 33:10.000]  You said you had this, this idea in your mind that you wanted to write this origin of iPhone
[33:11.280 --> 33:11.760]  story.
[33:12.320 --> 33:16.880]  It's like, well, you know, how do you, how do you go about putting something together
[33:16.880 --> 33:20.560]  when you don't have all of the information right in front of you?
[33:20.560 --> 33:23.520]  Well, this was, I don't want to talk too much.
[33:23.520 --> 33:28.640]  I want to talk about your stuff, not me, but, but it does, it intertwines.
[33:28.640 --> 33:32.720]  Obviously the creation of the iPhone obviously intertwines with your stuff very much.
[33:32.720 --> 33:38.080]  Just so anybody who is not familiar with your work, your role on the original iPhone is
[33:38.080 --> 33:41.920]  you were the directly responsible individual.
[33:41.920 --> 33:43.840]  The that's the term, right?
[33:43.840 --> 33:45.040]  Inside Apple, DRI.
[33:45.760 --> 33:46.400]  DRI.
[33:46.400 --> 33:46.900]  Yeah.
[33:47.440 --> 33:48.720]  For the keyboard.
[33:48.720 --> 33:50.480]  And we can get to a little bit of that story.
[33:50.480 --> 33:55.760]  You tell the whole story here, but it, you know, long story short, very fair to say you
[33:55.760 --> 33:58.560]  created the original iPhone software keyboard.
[33:59.440 --> 34:05.280]  And so obviously, and you were, well, you joined obviously to, you know, you joined
[34:05.280 --> 34:11.360]  Scott Forstall's iOS software team early because, you know, the keyboard was there when
[34:11.360 --> 34:13.440]  the iPhone was announced.
[34:13.440 --> 34:15.520]  So you were there from very early stages.
[34:15.520 --> 34:19.840]  I probably should have, if I were a better host, probably would have introduced you with
[34:19.840 --> 34:24.080]  a bit of a biography for people who aren't familiar, but I also, I want to assume that
[34:24.080 --> 34:26.960]  people are pretty familiar with you, but by this point,
[34:27.760 --> 34:30.000]  I have no idea whether they would be or not.
[34:30.000 --> 34:35.520]  Basically my burning desire for this came out of, well, it's long nagged me that I never
[34:35.520 --> 34:37.200]  put the whole story together.
[34:37.200 --> 34:42.000]  You know, Apple's people famously because it's, it's a prerequisite to work there.
[34:42.000 --> 34:45.120]  You keep your mouth shut on what you're working on when you're working there.
[34:45.120 --> 34:49.520]  It's a tight lip company, secret, whatever you, whatever adjectives you want to apply.
[34:49.520 --> 34:55.440]  And then as time goes on and people leave, they can be freer or feel freer to talk about
[34:55.440 --> 34:56.160]  what happened.
[34:56.160 --> 35:01.600]  And nobody's going to be too sensitive about, you know, stuff that happened 15 or 20 years
[35:01.600 --> 35:01.840]  ago.
[35:03.680 --> 35:09.520]  Andy Hertzfeld, legendary engineer on the original Macintosh team, put together a great
[35:09.520 --> 35:16.000]  website called folklore.org, collecting stories of the creation of the original Macintosh.
[35:16.000 --> 35:20.960]  And then that got collected into a terrific book, which, you know, based on the website
[35:20.960 --> 35:24.480]  called Revolution in the Valley, which is just a terrific book.
[35:24.480 --> 35:26.320]  I have the book in my hand right now.
[35:26.320 --> 35:27.760]  I keep it right by my desk.
[35:28.720 --> 35:29.440]  It's marvelous.
[35:30.080 --> 35:34.000]  You know, and he all again, what a memory he had.
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.480]  I mean, it's just unbelievable how much stuff and that's, you know, obviously, you know,
[35:38.480 --> 35:43.120]  that that was a time when a lot of the digital artifacts didn't survive.
[35:43.120 --> 35:45.600]  There wasn't really email at the time, right?
[35:45.600 --> 35:51.360]  Like 1982 working at Apple on the prototypes for the Macintosh, there wasn't like email
[35:51.360 --> 35:52.160]  you could save.
[35:52.160 --> 35:53.760]  There weren't text messages.
[35:53.760 --> 35:58.000]  A lot of the stuff he had was like shred, you know, printouts of paper and graph paper
[35:58.000 --> 35:58.880]  and stuff like that.
[35:58.880 --> 36:01.680]  But by the time it came out, it wasn't spoiling anything.
[36:01.680 --> 36:03.280]  It was, you know, the classic Mac OS.
[36:03.280 --> 36:07.520]  I think I forget if it was even still alive or if it was, you know, by that time.
[36:07.520 --> 36:09.440]  But, you know, you can do that.
[36:09.440 --> 36:14.480]  You're just looking at the copyright of Revolution in the Valley was, oh, Andy signed this one
[36:14.480 --> 36:14.800]  for me.
[36:14.800 --> 36:15.440]  That's very nice.
[36:15.440 --> 36:18.160]  What we but 2005.
[36:18.160 --> 36:20.880]  So, yeah, the classic was already even dead.
[36:20.880 --> 36:23.680]  Not that it would have mattered if he had published it five years earlier.
[36:23.680 --> 36:28.960]  Nobody was thinking it was secret what happened in 1983 or 1984 by that time.
[36:29.520 --> 36:36.080]  And now that the original iPhone is in our rearview mirror, we've had drips and drabs
[36:36.080 --> 36:41.280]  and things like your book and interviews with participants and stories that have leaked.
[36:41.280 --> 36:48.720]  And we on the outside know much more about how it happened than certainly the day that
[36:48.720 --> 36:53.680]  Steve Jobs held it up on stage when it seemed, you know, like almost a technical marvel,
[36:53.680 --> 36:58.080]  you know, almost too good to be true, both on the hardware and software side.
[36:58.080 --> 36:58.720]  Is this real?
[36:58.720 --> 37:00.160]  Is this really happening?
[37:00.160 --> 37:02.080]  We know so much more about it.
[37:02.080 --> 37:09.680]  But what's always nagged me is that so much of it is vague or conflicting, like what happened
[37:09.680 --> 37:12.720]  in 2006, what happened in 2005.
[37:12.720 --> 37:17.440]  And I'm not saying that my one 2003,000 word article put it all together.
[37:18.240 --> 37:20.480]  There's still so much more to dig there.
[37:20.480 --> 37:23.280]  There were iPod projects going on.
[37:23.280 --> 37:30.720]  There were pure research into multi-touch projects going on with Boz.
[37:30.720 --> 37:31.680]  What's his last name?
[37:31.680 --> 37:32.400]  Boss Orting.
[37:32.400 --> 37:34.320]  Yeah, Boz Orting.
[37:34.320 --> 37:39.360]  And I know Greg Christie, whom I've met a few times, you know, was worked with Boz on
[37:39.360 --> 37:43.760]  some of those ideas as just like, hey, is this multi-touch something we can use for
[37:43.760 --> 37:44.240]  anything?
[37:44.240 --> 37:48.640]  And we know that there were ideas that they would build a tablet first, and then it's
[37:48.640 --> 37:50.080]  like, no, let's build a phone.
[37:50.080 --> 37:52.800]  And then it's like, well, wait, should we use the multi-touch stuff with the phone?
[37:52.800 --> 37:54.560]  We know all these things, drips and drabs.
[37:55.840 --> 38:03.040]  But that stupid little Facebook story to his eye, I credit him, you know, it actually
[38:03.040 --> 38:03.760]  motivated me.
[38:03.760 --> 38:07.600]  It was Tony Fidel tweeting about it like the day later.
[38:07.600 --> 38:14.560]  And I guess he said in a tweet that he tried to reach out to me about correcting the description
[38:14.560 --> 38:18.880]  of him being responsible or spearheading the Linux OS part.
[38:18.880 --> 38:23.440]  And I think it's a sensitive thing for him, but I didn't want to just take his word for
[38:23.440 --> 38:23.600]  it.
[38:23.600 --> 38:25.520]  And, oh, Tony Fidel says it's not true.
[38:25.520 --> 38:27.920]  Well, then I should just publish a correction and say it's not true.
[38:27.920 --> 38:29.040]  But I thought, you know what?
[38:29.040 --> 38:30.800]  This has been bothering me for years.
[38:31.360 --> 38:32.640]  Let me try to dig into this.
[38:33.360 --> 38:35.760]  Let me get something off my chest.
[38:35.760 --> 38:41.840]  And I started collecting, talking to a few people, a few other people like noticed Fidel's
[38:41.840 --> 38:43.920]  tweet and sent me a few comments.
[38:43.920 --> 38:47.840]  People, a couple of people who still work at Apple, so I can't mention them, but who've
[38:47.840 --> 38:48.720]  been there long enough.
[38:48.720 --> 38:50.560]  Lots of people have been at Apple a long time.
[38:50.560 --> 38:55.840]  It's sort of one of the secret sauces at Apple, you know, that there's a long institutional
[38:55.840 --> 38:56.320]  memory.
[38:57.680 --> 39:02.080]  And I just thought, let me just see what I can collect and start putting it into an outline
[39:02.080 --> 39:03.280]  and collect some stuff.
[39:03.280 --> 39:10.240]  And it like time went on and I wanted to correct it quickly because I felt like what I and
[39:10.240 --> 39:13.920]  it always bothers me when something I actually put on Daring Fireball is wrong.
[39:13.920 --> 39:18.720]  And I often say, my goal is to be right always and have everything I write be tracked.
[39:18.720 --> 39:20.960]  I know I'm going to make mistakes.
[39:20.960 --> 39:25.600]  And so what I try to do is make as few mistakes as possible, but be open to the fact that
[39:25.600 --> 39:29.280]  I might be making a mistake anytime, recognize it and correct it.
[39:29.280 --> 39:34.880]  And it bothered me that those posts I put up in January and you tweeted about them too.
[39:35.520 --> 39:40.720]  But then it was, if you just took them at face value, it was misleading about Fidel's
[39:40.720 --> 39:46.640]  role and misleading in terms of the scope of the bake-off between these two OSs.
[39:46.640 --> 39:50.880]  Facebook's was clearly a years-long thing with hundreds of employees working on the
[39:50.880 --> 39:53.280]  one they ended up abandoning.
[39:53.280 --> 39:55.920]  Whereas the bake-off period at Apple was very short.
[39:55.920 --> 39:56.880]  I knew that.
[39:56.880 --> 39:58.080]  I knew that.
[39:58.080 --> 40:03.600]  And yet I still published it just as a, huh, that's a previous OS bake-off story for
[40:03.600 --> 40:06.480]  a secret project that was coming up and that's good enough.
[40:06.480 --> 40:08.320]  And then I just had all these notes.
[40:08.320 --> 40:13.120]  I had all these notes, a bunch of good sources, some of them public, like your tweets, some
[40:13.120 --> 40:14.240]  of them private.
[40:14.800 --> 40:16.800]  And I thought, how do I organize this together?
[40:16.800 --> 40:20.720]  I just felt like I just had like a shoebox of slips of paper.
[40:20.720 --> 40:21.920]  It's like, what do I do?
[40:21.920 --> 40:26.320]  And the stupid idea that hit me were the obvious idea that hit me.
[40:26.320 --> 40:30.160]  And I think you'll sympathize with this where in hindsight, once you have it, Oh, how
[40:30.160 --> 40:32.000]  did we not think of this all along?
[40:32.000 --> 40:33.360]  You can't remember not having it.
[40:33.360 --> 40:37.600]  But I thought the whole thing should hinge upon putting together a timeline.
[40:37.600 --> 40:41.280]  And that's the middle of the article I posted last night is just here.
[40:41.280 --> 40:48.400]  As best as I can figure is a timeline of certain events along the way, starting in like 2004
[40:48.400 --> 40:55.920]  with the agreement to do the rocker phone with Motorola to 2005 and my favorite.
[40:55.920 --> 41:00.640]  And you, I was so glad to see you tweet it 2006 colon hard work.
[41:05.600 --> 41:08.240]  It really, John, you nailed it.
[41:08.240 --> 41:08.880]  You really did.
[41:08.880 --> 41:16.320]  You weren't there, but you, you, you were able to divine what 2006 was all about for
[41:16.320 --> 41:16.640]  sure.
[41:16.640 --> 41:22.640]  But it does seem like that as a rough timeline, 2004 is this timeline where, and maybe all
[41:22.640 --> 41:28.240]  along it's in the two thousands, some, somebody at Apple is thinking we should make a cell
[41:28.240 --> 41:30.880]  phone because cell phone is a computer type thing.
[41:31.440 --> 41:36.800]  The iPod in 2001, obviously showed that Apple can make handheld things that are actually
[41:36.800 --> 41:37.920]  extremely compelling.
[41:38.560 --> 41:44.160]  There's this pressure, which was obviously true that circa 2004.
[41:44.800 --> 41:45.120]  Okay.
[41:45.120 --> 41:49.680]  The iPod is exploding in popularity, which is good.
[41:49.680 --> 41:55.040]  And the part of that hand in hand is the iTunes music store is exploding in popularity.
[41:55.040 --> 41:56.400]  That's from Apple's perspective.
[41:56.400 --> 41:57.040]  Very good.
[41:57.040 --> 42:00.080]  And from a consumer perspective, I think it's turned out to be good.
[42:00.080 --> 42:05.520]  It was the first step towards making digital music without any sort of physical media,
[42:06.720 --> 42:10.800]  a business, as opposed to just something you pirated over the internet.
[42:11.680 --> 42:11.920]  Right.
[42:12.720 --> 42:18.480]  But by 2004, cell phones were getting good enough that, you know, and I think, I don't
[42:18.480 --> 42:22.400]  think I quoted in my article, but in one of the books and I, you know, again, like a,
[42:22.400 --> 42:27.840]  like a conspiracy theorist, I, for the last five weeks, I've had like six books with each
[42:27.840 --> 42:31.840]  of them with eight bookmarks in it at the points that are relevant to what I was trying
[42:31.840 --> 42:32.720]  to put together.
[42:32.720 --> 42:36.880]  At one point though, Eddie Q spoke to someone, I think it was in the Becoming Steve Jobs
[42:36.880 --> 42:41.040]  book, but just said simply, look, it was obvious, you know, why carry two things in your
[42:41.040 --> 42:41.520]  pocket?
[42:41.520 --> 42:45.600]  Everybody at Apple, even people at Apple had an iPod in one pocket and a cell phone in
[42:45.600 --> 42:46.480]  the other.
[42:46.480 --> 42:49.280]  And if they were only going to get rid of one, it seems like they're going to probably
[42:49.280 --> 42:53.200]  going to get rid of the iPod if the, cause the iPod wasn't making phone calls, but the
[42:53.200 --> 42:54.160]  phone could play music.
[42:54.800 --> 42:56.480]  And so what are we going to do?
[42:56.480 --> 43:02.960]  Steve Jobs felt like Apple couldn't do Apple phone the Apple way where Apple made the
[43:02.960 --> 43:05.200]  decisions and said, this is what we want to make here.
[43:05.200 --> 43:08.960]  It is it's finished ready for the world because cell phones all had to go through, as he
[43:08.960 --> 43:15.040]  called them the orifices, the carriers and the carriers notoriously dictated all sorts
[43:15.040 --> 43:21.120]  of nonsense to every single company that made phones at the time, you know, Nokia, Ericsson,
[43:21.120 --> 43:26.560]  Sony, whoever else was making popular phone, BlackBerry at the time, everything had to
[43:26.560 --> 43:28.080]  be approved through the carriers.
[43:28.080 --> 43:29.200]  Apple didn't want to do that.
[43:29.200 --> 43:30.480]  Steve Jobs didn't want to do that.
[43:30.480 --> 43:31.200]  So, okay, fine.
[43:31.200 --> 43:36.320]  We'll let Motorola make a phone and we'll work with them to get iTunes working on it.
[43:36.320 --> 43:39.120]  And it turned out almost famously bad.
[43:39.760 --> 43:41.920]  I mean, the rocker is just famously bad.
[43:42.800 --> 43:43.920]  It's not a good phone.
[43:43.920 --> 43:45.120]  Seemed bad at the time.
[43:45.760 --> 43:48.400]  I it was one of those things I revisited.
[43:48.400 --> 43:52.960]  I remember describing it like when the demo failed at the introduction and it was like
[43:52.960 --> 43:59.120]  Steve Jobs wanted to demonstrate that you if you played music and you got a phone call,
[43:59.120 --> 44:03.360]  it would like duck out the music and you take the phone call.
[44:03.360 --> 44:07.120]  And then when you're in the phone call, the music would resume and the music didn't
[44:07.120 --> 44:07.620]  resume.
[44:08.480 --> 44:13.120]  And I remember writing that it seemed like he almost wanted to just throw the damn phone
[44:13.120 --> 44:16.320]  on the ground and on stage in front of everybody and say, ah, forget it.
[44:16.320 --> 44:16.720]  You know what?
[44:16.720 --> 44:17.680]  We're building our own phones.
[44:18.560 --> 44:19.360]  Stay tuned.
[44:19.360 --> 44:20.080]  But he didn't.
[44:20.080 --> 44:22.240]  He, you know, he was a pro and he stuck with it.
[44:22.240 --> 44:25.360]  But then I rewatched the video this week and I was like, nope.
[44:25.360 --> 44:27.520]  He thought about throwing that phone on the ground.
[44:27.520 --> 44:28.400]  He really was.
[44:28.400 --> 44:29.680]  He really did.
[44:29.680 --> 44:29.920]  Yeah.
[44:29.920 --> 44:31.120]  He broke character, right?
[44:31.120 --> 44:31.920]  He really did.
[44:32.800 --> 44:33.440]  Yeah.
[44:33.440 --> 44:34.160]  Yeah, for sure.
[44:34.160 --> 44:35.200]  It's it for sure.
[44:35.200 --> 44:40.080]  It's interesting because you wonder what's going on in that moment.
[44:40.080 --> 44:45.600]  It's like, when did he decide that, OK, we're actually doing this thing ourselves?
[44:45.600 --> 44:50.320]  And you you can almost you can almost see the wheels turning in his mind.
[44:50.320 --> 44:52.800]  It's like it's right right now.
[44:52.800 --> 44:53.440]  Right.
[44:53.440 --> 44:54.320]  That's this is it.
[44:54.880 --> 44:56.640]  You know, we just need to do better ourselves.
[44:56.640 --> 44:57.200]  Right.
[44:57.200 --> 45:05.680]  And, you know, it it you know, the the iPod is is all gave.
[45:05.680 --> 45:12.160]  I think I gave Apple the confidence that the company could do it, that, you know, you kind
[45:12.160 --> 45:19.840]  of you kind of look at, you know, so much of what happened at Apple happened because
[45:19.840 --> 45:25.680]  of the talent that the company could attract, that there were these amazing designers and
[45:25.680 --> 45:31.600]  these highly skillful engineers and these excellent marketers and, you know, all of
[45:31.600 --> 45:36.960]  the lawyers and then the supply chain and the operations and everything like that goes
[45:36.960 --> 45:38.480]  into making a great product.
[45:39.040 --> 45:42.960]  But really, you know, what did Steve add?
[45:42.960 --> 45:47.600]  And, you know, I think it's, you know, maybe clear and obvious to say, but I think still
[45:47.600 --> 45:50.160]  worth saying that he provided the vision.
[45:50.160 --> 45:54.880]  He provided that we're going to go and do that, that that's the product that we're
[45:54.880 --> 46:00.560]  going to make and to just marshal all those resources and point point everybody in the
[46:00.560 --> 46:06.880]  same direction and give them a clear idea of what they wanted to do or what he wanted
[46:06.880 --> 46:08.480]  everybody to do.
[46:08.480 --> 46:14.480]  And, you know, I think one of the great things, you know, going back and looking at, you know,
[46:14.480 --> 46:18.800]  you say you mentioned looking at old videos, going back and looking at Steve, say, when
[46:18.800 --> 46:24.800]  he was at the all things digital conferences with the Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher up
[46:24.800 --> 46:31.360]  on stage over many years, he'll very often use the phrase making great products.
[46:31.360 --> 46:32.080]  What does Apple do?
[46:32.080 --> 46:33.360]  Well, we make great products.
[46:33.360 --> 46:34.880]  They ask him, what do you do in the morning?
[46:34.880 --> 46:39.200]  Well, I have a team of people get together and we figure out how to make great products.
[46:39.200 --> 46:40.480]  That's what he cared about.
[46:41.040 --> 46:43.360]  And so that's what he brought to the company.
[46:43.360 --> 46:49.840]  That's the momentum that he brought to the overall effort so that then people like me,
[46:49.840 --> 46:53.680]  you know, eventually, you know, there's a problem like making a software keyboard for
[46:53.680 --> 46:57.760]  this new phone that we're going to make that, you know, is just very, very clear to me that
[46:57.760 --> 46:59.440]  that's my piece in the puzzle.
[46:59.440 --> 47:04.320]  And so I just set about trying to actually deliver it so that there could be a whole
[47:04.320 --> 47:10.880]  product and that, you know, that Steve was like gathering up all of these pieces and,
[47:10.880 --> 47:17.840]  you know, and figuring out what the jigsaw looked like and and how all of these pieces
[47:17.840 --> 47:21.200]  would come together and what the final picture would look like.
[47:21.200 --> 47:25.520]  And of course, one of the major things that he did as well was, you know, sometimes you
[47:25.520 --> 47:31.920]  wind up with a beautiful piece that's, you know, excellent and marvelous all by itself.
[47:32.960 --> 47:34.560]  But it doesn't fit into the puzzle.
[47:35.280 --> 47:42.960]  And so he had this this intuition about, you know, what would be the pieces to keep and
[47:42.960 --> 47:49.200]  how should they be arranged so that the final picture would be would be wonderful.
[47:49.200 --> 47:52.640]  And so in a way, you know, you think think about, you know, what was Steve's job?
[47:52.640 --> 47:54.480]  It's like he was like an editor.
[47:54.480 --> 47:59.120]  He was just a great editor of of of everybody's work.
[47:59.120 --> 48:03.760]  He'd give out the story assignments and then the work would come back and he would figure
[48:03.760 --> 48:10.800]  out, well, OK, well, how do we make, you know, like either a magazine or a newspaper edition
[48:10.800 --> 48:11.680]  out of it?
[48:11.680 --> 48:15.600]  And he was an absolute genius at it.
[48:15.600 --> 48:20.480]  I always think of him as as being analogous, his role being analogous to a film director
[48:20.480 --> 48:27.520]  in terms of the film director doesn't have to put their hands on the camera, didn't write
[48:27.520 --> 48:37.040]  the script, doesn't show up as an actor on camera, doesn't build the sets, may not even
[48:37.040 --> 48:37.840]  edit the film.
[48:38.400 --> 48:42.640]  There's an editor who edits the film after it's been shot, but is there every step of
[48:42.640 --> 48:47.680]  the way to say this is what I want it to be like or this isn't good enough or that's great?
[48:47.680 --> 48:49.200]  That's that's an amazing idea.
[48:49.200 --> 48:52.560]  But what if I've always thought that.
[48:52.560 --> 48:53.920]  But let's let's take a break.
[48:53.920 --> 48:57.920]  And then I want to ask you about how you got started on the iPhone team, because it's one
[48:57.920 --> 48:59.440]  of my favorite parts of the book.
[48:59.440 --> 49:02.240]  But let me tell you right now about our next sponsor.
[49:02.240 --> 49:10.000]  It is our good friends at Retool, internal tools like dashboards, admin panels, custom
[49:10.000 --> 49:16.720]  crud apps, CRUD can dramatically speed up how your business operates, but building them
[49:16.720 --> 49:21.600]  from scratch and maintaining them over in time involves a lot of tedious work.
[49:22.160 --> 49:26.320]  Retool helps developers build these internal tools much faster.
[49:26.320 --> 49:33.760]  Retool offers a complete UI library with over 80 fully featured accessible components that
[49:33.760 --> 49:36.560]  you can drag and drop into any interface.
[49:36.560 --> 49:41.600]  And from there, you can connect your interface to any source, any data source like a database,
[49:42.240 --> 49:49.600]  customize anything with JavaScript and deploy your apps all within Retool with app environment,
[49:49.600 --> 49:54.640]  permissions, SSO and other time saving features available out of the box.
[49:54.640 --> 49:59.920]  The result, you can build production grade business apps without Googling for component
[49:59.920 --> 50:06.480]  libraries, debugging dependencies or rewriting boilerplate code.
[50:06.480 --> 50:12.800]  Thousands of teams at companies like Amazon, DoorDash, Volvo and Brex collaborate around
[50:12.800 --> 50:17.600]  custom built Retool apps that solve internal workflows.
[50:18.400 --> 50:19.440]  I've checked this out.
[50:19.440 --> 50:21.600]  They sponsored Daring Fireball a couple months ago.
[50:21.600 --> 50:24.320]  It is really, really, I love it.
[50:24.320 --> 50:28.240]  It's so good that it makes me want to use it to build something.
[50:28.240 --> 50:33.040]  It's I'm not saying I know people throw around the sort of a hypercard for the modern age
[50:33.040 --> 50:35.520]  a lot and it don't get into specifics.
[50:35.520 --> 50:40.800]  It's not supposed to be a clone of hypercard, but it has that same sort of, oh, you just
[50:40.800 --> 50:43.840]  drag things out and click on the thing you want to.
[50:43.840 --> 50:45.200]  Oh, here's the button.
[50:45.200 --> 50:49.680]  Add the code that the button makes happen when you click the button right there by clicking
[50:49.680 --> 50:50.720]  on the button.
[50:50.720 --> 50:57.440]  The sort of right combination of WYSIWYG visualness for dragging out the forms and connecting
[50:57.440 --> 50:59.760]  the visual parts to the code that you want to write.
[51:00.560 --> 51:02.560]  And then you just hit a button and there it is.
[51:02.560 --> 51:04.160]  And it's just running and it works.
[51:04.160 --> 51:08.000]  And you're like, huh, I have an app, really, really cool stuff.
[51:08.000 --> 51:08.400]  Great.
[51:08.400 --> 51:09.200]  It looks great.
[51:10.320 --> 51:11.440]  They're moving very fast.
[51:11.440 --> 51:15.520]  They've already added so much stuff just since the time they sponsored Daring Fireball a
[51:15.520 --> 51:17.040]  couple of months ago.
[51:17.040 --> 51:22.240]  Go to Retool, R-E-T-O-O-L.com to find out more.
[51:22.240 --> 51:25.440]  That's Retool.com to find out more.
[51:25.440 --> 51:30.720]  One of my favorite parts of your book, Ken, is is that you almost didn't work on the iPhone.
[51:30.720 --> 51:33.680]  It sounds to me like so long story.
[51:33.680 --> 51:40.320]  So when did you when did you start at Apple around 2001 in June?
[51:40.320 --> 51:44.480]  I was on my birthday of June in June of 2001.
[51:44.480 --> 51:44.960]  All right.
[51:44.960 --> 51:48.080]  So June 2001, Mac OS X is brand new.
[51:48.080 --> 51:58.160]  And the first thing, the first project you worked on at Apple was what became known as
[51:58.160 --> 51:59.920]  Safari or WebKit.
[51:59.920 --> 52:03.840]  I mean, I guess before you'd even there was a difference between Safari and WebKit.
[52:03.840 --> 52:04.880]  Which one would you?
[52:04.880 --> 52:07.040]  Well, actually, so yeah.
[52:07.040 --> 52:18.160]  When I joined, I joined the same day as Don Melton, and he and I had worked at a company
[52:18.160 --> 52:26.240]  called Easel, which interestingly was founded by Andy Hertzfeld, the fellow who did Folklore.org.
[52:26.240 --> 52:30.320]  That's how I got him to sign the copy of the book that I have on my desk here.
[52:30.320 --> 52:39.760]  That Andy, of course, was one of the instrumental developers in the original Mac OS in the 80s.
[52:40.880 --> 52:47.600]  And so, you know, Easel unfortunately didn't succeed, but it had gathered up this amazing
[52:47.600 --> 52:49.920]  set of talented people.
[52:50.480 --> 52:58.960]  And one of the other top executives at Easel was a fellow named Bug Tribble, who went off
[52:58.960 --> 53:04.880]  with Steve Jobs when Steve left Apple or was ousted from Apple, however you want to characterize
[53:04.880 --> 53:08.960]  that, in 1985 to found NeXT.
[53:08.960 --> 53:13.360]  And so Bud was our VP of engineering at Easel.
[53:13.360 --> 53:20.720]  And when it was clear that Easel didn't have a history anymore, I'm pretty sure he just
[53:20.720 --> 53:24.960]  got on the phone and called Steve and said, hey, we've got all of these wonderful engineers.
[53:25.840 --> 53:26.960]  Maybe you want to hire some.
[53:26.960 --> 53:33.120]  So Apple actually held a job fair for Easel on the Infinite Loop campus.
[53:33.120 --> 53:40.400]  So, I mean, it was really like, you know, like we were a high school and up on the fourth
[53:40.400 --> 53:44.320]  floor of Infinite Loop 2, which at that time was a game room.
[53:44.320 --> 53:48.560]  It was a pool table and a couple of the old coin operated arcade machines.
[53:49.440 --> 53:55.040]  Yeah, there was a bunch of hiring managers that struck up conversations with a whole
[53:55.040 --> 54:03.120]  bunch of us. And so I was very interested in going to Apple because at that point, Easel
[54:03.120 --> 54:08.640]  was the fourth company that I had worked at in the preceding two years.
[54:09.600 --> 54:13.280]  If you think about, you know, the kind of the dot com era, there were these startups
[54:13.280 --> 54:15.120]  came and these startups went.
[54:15.120 --> 54:21.840]  And, you know, to me, Apple seemed like a well, I'd always loved the company and it
[54:21.840 --> 54:26.240]  just seemed like, you know, OK, this Mac OS X is out and, you know, the company Steve
[54:26.240 --> 54:30.320]  is back and the companies probably got a good future ahead of it.
[54:30.320 --> 54:36.080]  And it was actually making money, which was more than you could say for any of these previous
[54:36.080 --> 54:37.280]  startups that I had worked for.
[54:37.280 --> 54:41.280]  So I was really enthusiastic about finding a job somewhere.
[54:41.280 --> 54:46.960]  And I had actually had a good lead on working for the system preferences team.
[54:46.960 --> 54:56.800]  Hmm. And before I could get even get an offer, Don, who again I had worked with at
[54:56.800 --> 55:01.600]  Easel, Don and I were the two directors of engineering reporting to Bud.
[55:03.040 --> 55:07.600]  Don was doing the client side of our effort, which I won't get into.
[55:07.600 --> 55:13.840]  And I was doing the server side code for our effort at Easel, which was would basically
[55:13.840 --> 55:18.480]  use Linux on the desktop with some online services layered on top.
[55:18.480 --> 55:19.520]  And it didn't work.
[55:19.520 --> 55:22.640]  So we were trying to figure out what was what what we should do.
[55:23.280 --> 55:28.400]  And so Don pulled me aside and said, here, why don't you come and take a take a ride
[55:28.400 --> 55:28.720]  with me?
[55:28.720 --> 55:32.080]  So we went over to the computer literacy bookshop.
[55:32.080 --> 55:39.280]  So we went to an actual physical brick and mortar bookstore and he went in and he you
[55:39.280 --> 55:43.200]  know, he bought a couple of books and he came back out and we got in his car and he put
[55:43.200 --> 55:48.880]  down the O'Reilly Rhino JavaScript book, right?
[55:48.880 --> 55:50.480]  JavaScript, the definitive guide.
[55:51.680 --> 55:52.480]  Right, right.
[55:52.480 --> 55:57.840]  So he put that book down on the console in between the two seats in the front of his
[55:57.840 --> 55:58.160]  car.
[55:59.200 --> 56:02.480]  And he said, Ken, you want to make a web browser?
[56:03.440 --> 56:06.880]  And I was like, sure.
[56:07.520 --> 56:07.680]  What?
[56:07.680 --> 56:09.200]  This sounded completely crazy.
[56:10.000 --> 56:10.720]  But he said, yeah.
[56:10.720 --> 56:16.160]  So he was talking to Scott Forrestal and Scott Forrestal wanted to bring him on, start a
[56:16.160 --> 56:17.120]  new project.
[56:17.120 --> 56:19.040]  He was going to make Don the manager.
[56:19.040 --> 56:24.880]  And Don in that moment offered to me an opportunity to be his team.
[56:26.480 --> 56:35.120]  So he and I then just a couple of weeks later in June of 2001 started and the job was to
[56:35.120 --> 56:36.080]  make a web browser.
[56:36.080 --> 56:40.080]  He was the manager and I was his team to two people.
[56:41.600 --> 56:45.840]  And the idea at the time, basically, why make a web browser?
[56:45.840 --> 56:46.960]  Why should Apple make their own?
[56:46.960 --> 56:48.480]  There was Internet Explorer.
[56:48.480 --> 56:51.440]  There was Mozilla.
[56:53.120 --> 56:54.080]  There were Firefox.
[56:54.080 --> 56:58.640]  I guess Firefox wasn't named Firefox yet, but you know, there were other browsers.
[56:58.640 --> 56:59.840]  You could run them on the Mac.
[57:02.000 --> 57:02.480]  Two things.
[57:02.480 --> 57:08.400]  I think if you're picky about the details, it was absolutely true that none of the browsers
[57:08.400 --> 57:12.560]  on Mac OS 10 felt native to Mac OS 10.
[57:12.560 --> 57:17.680]  And, you know, just little things like it with Internet Explorer.
[57:17.680 --> 57:25.040]  There were issues that it was ported from classic Mac OS to Mac OS 10 and had, you know,
[57:25.040 --> 57:28.640]  text rendering didn't quite look right on the Mac OS 10 side.
[57:28.640 --> 57:32.080]  And I know that's in some ways that sounds like such a silly little thing.
[57:32.080 --> 57:33.920]  Like, well, just render the text differently.
[57:33.920 --> 57:42.000]  But in those transitional years, it really made a difference.
[57:42.720 --> 57:48.080]  And because screens had so many fewer pixels per inch at the time, the difference was,
[57:48.080 --> 57:49.360]  you know, very noticeable.
[57:49.360 --> 57:54.800]  You didn't really have to be a super picky font snob to say, oh, the text doesn't look
[57:54.800 --> 57:55.120]  as good.
[57:55.120 --> 57:58.240]  But, you know, the way the buttons look and things work.
[57:58.240 --> 58:04.560]  And it was never going to be nobody was going to make a true great Mac browser unless Apple
[58:04.560 --> 58:05.520]  did it themselves.
[58:05.520 --> 58:11.680]  And then I think the other reason is that just web browsers were obviously so important,
[58:11.680 --> 58:12.080]  right?
[58:12.080 --> 58:17.040]  There's all sorts of other things that maybe there's not a great blank for the Mac.
[58:17.840 --> 58:20.640]  And you could say, well, but it's not that important, right?
[58:20.640 --> 58:24.480]  It's not so important that there's, you know, fill in your product category here.
[58:24.480 --> 58:29.440]  Web browser didn't, you know, seemed like it was, you know, to put it in the Tim Cook
[58:29.440 --> 58:34.240]  terms, an essential technology that Apple should control, you know, that it was too
[58:34.240 --> 58:35.360]  important not to have their own.
[58:36.560 --> 58:37.120]  Right.
[58:37.120 --> 58:47.520]  And so one of the other things that, you know, you were introducing this topic, you know,
[58:47.520 --> 58:49.760]  talking about both Safari and WebKit.
[58:49.760 --> 58:55.920]  Well, I can tell you that from day one, both of those were absolutely essential, that part
[58:55.920 --> 59:02.880]  of our charge was to make a web browser, but that also we needed to make a web framework
[59:02.880 --> 59:08.240]  that you could use to make a web browser, because I think it's really one of the underappreciated
[59:08.240 --> 59:16.960]  aspects of Apple's long term success in the, you know, the Steve Jobs 2.0, you know, you
[59:16.960 --> 59:22.400]  know, Steve returning to Apple, you know, starting from that date in the late 90s all
[59:22.400 --> 59:31.920]  the way through to today is the success of Apple's software frameworks, giving not only
[59:31.920 --> 59:37.040]  third party developers, but just as importantly, the internal first party developers, these
[59:37.040 --> 59:43.760]  great software development tools to make great apps.
[59:43.760 --> 59:54.400]  And so the goal was that we needed to deliver a framework that we could give out to third
[59:54.400 --> 59:58.240]  party developers to make great web app, web apps of their own.
[59:58.240 --> 01:00:04.480]  And they're not really web apps, but technologies that deeply integrated the web into the overall
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:07.520]  experience, right, just to be very clear about that.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:14.560]  So it was part of the job right from the start to do both Safari and WebKit.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.560]  But of course, we didn't have those names.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:18.640]  I mean, we really didn't have anything.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:24.000]  We didn't know from day one whether we were going to build something ourselves, whether,
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.960]  you know, Don and I used to joke that we sit down, you know, we get a terminal and we go
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:34.560]  VI web browser dot C, and we just start typing, you know, the code to write a web browser.
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:38.640]  I mean, that was kind of the the joke.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:46.080]  Do we do that, you know, to buy or do we to build or do we buy something from, you know,
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:51.320]  some existing web browser vendor and bring that code in house and try to customize it?
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:01:02.280]  Or do we go and try to latch on to some open source that was available and begin our work
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:07.320]  by customizing that and, you know, to make a very long story short, what you know, what
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:13.840]  we wound up, we wound up looking at Mozilla, we wound up looking at Opera, and we eventually
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:23.560]  fixed on the work, the web browsing frameworks, HTML and KJS from the KTE desktop environment
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:25.520]  on Linux.
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:33.080]  And we found that it was, you know, pretty easy to work with and it's actually is a one
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:40.640]  more digression is that this was a difficult thing for Don and I to, to, to decide on.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:46.360]  We were actually really looking back quite indecisive about it.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:50.520]  And we had going on been going on for about six weeks saying, Well, do we build do we
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:56.200]  buy do we do open source, do this investigation in this framework or that.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:00.280]  And right around that time, we're saying, Well, this can be a pretty big job to make
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:02.880]  a web browser and a web framework.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.780]  So we need to hire some people.
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:07.940]  And so we hired this fellow, Richard Williamson.
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:14.200]  And Richard came on, and he, again, about six weeks into the effort, and we didn't really
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:22.640]  have very much to show for what we that that time between when Don and I started and when
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.360]  Richard started.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.920]  And so Richard wanted, you know, kind of we wanted to give him an update on what we were
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:28.920]  doing.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:30.460]  And he was interested to hear about our progress.
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:34.200]  And he was like, really not impressed at all.
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:38.420]  He kind of he liked the idea of making a web browser seemed like a big project, something
[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:39.780]  worth doing.
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:41.360]  But he was completely unimpressed.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.040]  So he went off by himself for like two days.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.920]  And we're gonna Don and I were kind of looking at each other's like, Well, Richard seems
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:48.920]  busy.
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:52.320]  I don't know, he seemed, you know, maybe, you know, he's gonna come up with something.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:59.820]  And he did most really quite remarkably, he had taken this KDE code from Linux, and just
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:07.320]  absolutely jammed it onto the Mac got x windows running on the Mac, took this Linux code,
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:15.480]  started compiling on Mac OS X, and brought the browser up under x windows on the Mac
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.280]  in like two days.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:21.960]  And he called us into his office to give the give us a demo of the thing.
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:26.120]  And he just starts browsing the web on on.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.120]  It was incredible.
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:37.200]  I was absolutely, absolutely one of the most awesome displays of just jam pied to hackery,
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:43.260]  chicken wire and duct tape to get something that provided us with a vision of the future.
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:46.460]  It was really just an absolutely remarkable piece of work.
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:50.300]  And that just the next day I went we I went home from that.
[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:55.280]  And you know, it came in the next day and stood up a Linux box and downloaded Katie
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:00.760]  and really did started doing some analysis to figure out what code what what files do
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:12.200]  we actually need to bring over from Katie and and k k HTML and kj kjs to get our project
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:13.920]  starting in earnest.
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:19.200]  So if you go and look when you can on track dot webkit.org I mean, it's a WebKit is an
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.840]  open source project, you can go back and look and some of the first you know, the first
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:34.080]  commit is mine of just a couple of files from from the Katie project and we started on that.
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:42.740]  And you know, that development still proceeds more than you know, 2020 years, 20 years on.
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:46.560]  It's no longer a fresh transition from K HTML to WebKit.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:51.960]  It's no way no, no, it is really had a whole life of its own now.
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:55.680]  This story is told in great in great detail in the book.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:58.760]  But one of the things I read, that's one of the parts I reread and one of the parts that
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:03.040]  really struck me is at that point, it's three of you.
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:09.840]  It's Don Melton, you and now Richard Williamson, it's it's three people who are still like
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:12.380]  just sort of, you know, and you do have a firm mission.
[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:17.840]  The mission is pretty clear, you're going to build a great Mac web browser with a great
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:22.640]  engine that could be kiddified in Apple's terms, right?
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:26.680]  And so that, you know, I think about the ways that Apple has used WebKit, not just Safari,
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:31.040]  but WebKit since there was dashboard for a couple of years where the components were
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.400]  all built in WebKit.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:36.280]  There are little parts, you know, like the help system could now be written, you know,
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:40.500]  now use WebKit as the rendering engine for help information.
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:45.040]  Parts of iTunes could be rendered as HTML.
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:50.000]  And you know, Apple news today is it's all over the place, which doesn't even get to
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.160]  the point that by the time you got to make a phone, now you have your own engine.
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:06:00.840]  And obviously, an engine needed to be customized greatly to run on a three and a half inch
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:08.360]  diagonal touchscreen with pinch zoom and all these other things, you know, put even putting
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:16.000]  that part of the serendipity of having a great extensible componentized framework that could
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  do it.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.700]  You know, it obviously made sense.
[01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:23.080]  But at that point, it's just three of you, you and Don are mostly thinking, well, how
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:28.920]  can we shoehorn the Mozilla project into something that we can build on?
[01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:35.200]  And you know, maybe if Richard Williamson hadn't been available, or if he hadn't taken
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:39.800]  a job, or you hadn't decided to hire him, or somebody else had been employee three,
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:42.160]  maybe WebKit is totally different today.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:44.120]  You know, it's, it's entirely possible.
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:45.480]  We might have failed, right?
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:46.480]  We might have failed.
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.480]  Yeah, right.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:48.480]  Sure.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:53.800]  And, you know, I mean, failure may not have been an option to keep your jobs at Apple.
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:58.520]  But failure was an option in this case, where Apple had web browsers, right.
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:02.200]  And and when Safari debuted, it was a surprise announcement.
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:09.720]  It wasn't like, you know, it wasn't completely obvious that Apple needed absolutely positively
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:14.480]  needed its own browser, it was well, it would be nice, it would be nicer to have their own
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:18.680]  web browser that rather than rely on Internet Explorer, and these other options that people
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:23.880]  have that are mostly built on cross platform code bases, and therefore don't embrace the
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:24.880]  Mac.
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:27.200]  And, you know, maybe it can't be componentized easily.
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:28.200]  That that was the whole problem.
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:31.960]  Again, long story short, that was the whole problem with Mozilla was that it really was
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.600]  it was sort of the opposite of the framework mentality.
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:41.400]  It was just this gigantic monolithic code base that they built to sort of abstract out
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:45.560]  all the details because they wanted it to be cross platform, right by wanting Mozilla
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.120]  to run anywhere.
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:52.600]  They sort of built effectively their own operating system at a conceptual level that everything
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:53.600]  ran on.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:57.040]  And it was therefore hard to just pick out the Well, we just want the rendering part.
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.560]  You know, we just want the JavaScript engine.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:02.080]  And it was like, no, you kind of got to take this whole thing.
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:03.080]  Right.
[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:06.480]  Anyway, the WebKit thing turned out pretty well.
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:13.640]  You know, I just was looking at something came across my feed, I know it was Twitter
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:19.600]  or somewhere, the latest web browser statistics.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:25.080]  And so I went and looked and basically everybody uses WebKit to surf the web these days, whether
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:33.880]  it's in Safari, either on the Mac or in iOS or in the fork of WebKit that happened some
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:36.980]  years ago that now powers Chrome.
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:41.520]  So the entire web, I mean, it's it really is remarkable to think that it was just these
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:44.840]  three guys who didn't know anything about the web.
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:49.040]  Well, it's actually to be fair, Don was the one who did because he actually had worked
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.040]  at Netscape.
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:56.360]  Before easel, so it's one guy who knew about the web, two guys who didn't, and we're learning
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:58.320]  about it as quickly as we could.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:02.860]  And that, you know, some help for some smart people who did some good work in the open
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:04.240]  source world.
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:09.760]  Yeah, now, in the fullness of time, you know, things have completely changed.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:13.520]  I hate to say it, but I think it was me who linked to the thing about the web browsing
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.720]  statistics.
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:18.040]  But going by those stats, we did.
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:21.160]  That is a way I would have seen it.
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:22.160]  It is true.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:27.840]  But the path from KHTML to WebKit, and then for years, the first few years of Chrome,
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:33.880]  it was, they were just using WebKit, then, you know, opinions divided on, you know, where
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:34.880]  it should go.
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:38.520]  So Google forked it, and they have, I think they call it Blink or Chromium, whatever you
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:39.760]  want to call their version.
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:42.360]  But clearly, it was a fork from WebKit.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:45.880]  So the family tree is clear.
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:51.600]  As years have gone by, I think the only one left that's not derived from WebKit is the
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:57.280]  Mozilla engine in Firefox, which still has like nine, or let's give them 10%.
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:01.280]  Let's round up, to be generous, 10% of desktop browsing.
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:04.460]  But mobile browsing is a majority of browsing.
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:11.120]  And so overall browsing usage, you know, it's got to be something like 96 or 97% WebKit
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:17.020]  or Chrome, which is derived from WebKit, including, you know, Microsoft's own browser edge, which
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:23.260]  is the most, that's the part that would seem bananas, I think, if time traveling John Gruber
[01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:28.480]  went back and met with Don Melton, Ken Kashenda, and Richard Williamson while you guys were
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:35.160]  noodling over his demo, two day demo of getting Conquerer to run on the Mac.
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:41.920]  And I said, By the way, 20 years from now, 97% of all web browsing on all computing platforms,
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:44.920]  including those that haven't been you, you haven't been invented yet, we'll be using
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:47.160]  the derivation of your work right here.
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.720]  And you would have said, Well, that's, it's, it's, yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty crazy.
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:58.080]  Because actually, you know, I write about it in the book about the the effort to make
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.920]  a safari and WebKit fast.
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:11.280]  We used I had a Windows machine in my office and re we ran IE on Windows as the benchmark
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:14.440]  for how fast we needed to be.
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:18.420]  And in the beginning of the project, it was absolutely comical.
[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:26.500]  We were three, four or five times slower than Windows than IE on Windows.
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:36.200]  As a matter of fact, it is really quite annoyingly IE had this, this obnoxious click sound.
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:42.040]  When it would load, you know, go like go off and I'd probably begin fetching the URL.
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:50.000]  And so it would just go, click, click, click, click, click, because we just was it's like,
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:56.640]  how are we ever going to be that fast when I, you know, when ours was was just going
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:01.120]  three, took three times as long, or more to get through the thing.
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:05.800]  And, you know, it really I have to give Don Melton just a huge amount of credit for saying,
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:09.780]  you know, for it's almost like, you know, like a Zen master, he said, the way we're
[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:14.320]  going to make the web browser faster is by never making it slower, right?
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:19.160]  He just absolutely refused to accept any check ins into our code base.
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:24.200]  Even as the team grew, eventually, we had probably about eight or nine or maybe even
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:31.440]  10 people on the project by timely shift, a huge, huge team can just absolutely enormous,
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:40.760]  enormous Silicon Valley team of almost almost a dozen people, almost through to do a web
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:41.760]  browser.
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:42.760]  Well, what is it?
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:43.760]  But that's it.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:44.760]  I love that story from Don.
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:45.760]  I don't want to spend too much time on it.
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:51.600]  But to restate it, the basic rule instituted by Don Melton was anytime an engineer wanted
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:57.800]  to check in code for a new feature or an updated feature, you had to run your page load test,
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:59.540]  I think it was you called it.
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:04.760]  And it's just loading real world web pages from real sites that people actually use that
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:06.180]  were popular.
[01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:12.600]  And Safari had to be as fast or faster than it was, you know, preferably faster, but not
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:13.600]  slower.
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:17.600]  And if it was slower, then back to the drawing board, see what you can do in your code to
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:21.280]  make sure that when you do check this feature in, it always gets faster.
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:24.400]  And it sounds I think people out there who don't program and certainly haven't been
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:28.960]  involved in larger software projects that you might think, well, that must be the norm
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:30.120]  everywhere.
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:34.080]  But the real norm everywhere is we'll fix it later.
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.080]  Right?
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:40.120]  Like, yep, like we we were told we've got to get support for blank in here.
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:43.280]  You know, like, let's say it's a new CSS spec, right?
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:46.800]  CSS 1.1 came out, we only support 1.0.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:47.920]  There's these things we need to do.
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:48.920]  We've checked them in.
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:56.520]  Ah, but look, when we use these CSS 1.1 things, it's 10% slower rendering yahoo.com in the
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:57.920]  New York Times com.
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:58.920]  We'll fix it later.
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:01.700]  Okay, let's go because we've got these other things on our list.
[01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:05.480]  We've also got to support this other new thing and new technology.
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:09.040]  And we, you know, we've always been meaning to make printing better, keep going.
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:13.400]  And then those will fix it laters pile up and next thing you know, it's slow.
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.760]  Yeah, yeah, it's absolutely true.
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:22.520]  And you know, there were and Don just simply refused to have it be the way that we worked.
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:26.320]  I remember there was one time that I was working on some big feature.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.400]  I actually don't remember the feature.
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:33.560]  But I do remember the phone call that I got on like the Friday evening that hey, I finished
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.560]  the work.
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:38.240]  And as I check it in, no, naturally, you know, another programmer joke, you know, you, you
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:41.720]  make a big check in and then you go home for the weekend.
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:47.240]  The you know, he gave me a call and said, Ken, I checked out your code, and I ran the
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:50.100]  page load test and slower, it's got to come back out.
[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:53.280]  And it's like, Don, you always What do you what do you mean, I mean, it's just like huge
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:54.280]  amount of work.
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:55.280]  And it's all these new features.
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:57.740]  And he says, I don't care.
[01:14:57.740 --> 01:15:00.000]  And it was absolutely the right thing to do.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.820]  And and you would you would think, you know, if you are, you know, a developer, or maybe
[01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:10.000]  you're just thinking this through logically, well, how can you make the software do more
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:16.880]  add features, and yet still have it be faster than it was without those features there,
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:24.220]  like your your mention of like, CSS one dot one, it's actually doing more to implement
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:28.680]  a more complex, complicated version of a spec.
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:35.240]  And the trick was, you know, that, that the code base was sufficiently large, and sufficiently
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:42.920]  not, or insufficiently understood by us, that there was always an opportunity to go into
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:51.080]  some new area, understand that a little bit, optimize it a little bit and offset the the
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:16:00.760]  cost of adding the new features in subsystem A, with optimizations in subsystem B. And
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:07.720]  as long as the browser was faster, that was okay, as fast or equal, then it was okay,
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:09.080]  we could proceed.
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:13.640]  And so it was just a matter of matter of kind of sometimes shuffling around these these
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:19.620]  these chips around the table, and trying to think of, you know, like new and interesting
[01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:26.080]  ways that we could either optimize here or there, or sometimes gathering up little optimizations
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:28.340]  to, you know, to offset things.
[01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:32.240]  And we didn't really game the system either, you think that we could use like save an optimization
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:33.240]  for when we needed it.
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:39.120]  No, we just very honestly and straightforwardly tried to do the best job adding features and
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:41.480]  never letting the thing get slower.
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:45.160]  And you know, and and crazy, you know, and crazy enough, it worked.
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:50.400]  That would be that work that would be dastardly if you like you had part of the code in your
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:55.660]  purview and and and you had an optimization, but you it was like, oh, but then if I do
[01:16:55.660 --> 01:16:59.560]  something else, and it makes it slower, I'll check in my optimization for this other thing
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:01.460]  that I've had in my pocket.
[01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:04.800]  And then the whole thing feels faster.
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:09.520]  It's you know, it's just as it's like, I'm an absolutely like horrid liar.
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:15.400]  And I get I get, you know, such like childlike enthusiasm, if I had actually discovered an
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:18.960]  excellent optimization, there's absolutely no way I would have been able to keep it to
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:20.080]  myself.
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:24.160]  And so, you know, it just was the it was the culture was a good positive culture.
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:30.200]  And so, you know, and put that together with a plan and a clear goal and there you go.
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:37.400]  We're watching the my wife and I are watching the show Pam and Tommy on Hulu, which is about
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:43.560]  the Pamela Anderson, Tommy Lee, both their marriage personally, which is more I you know,
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:48.120]  I was around at the time it but the famous sex tape that came out and was sold over the
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:49.120]  web.
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:55.000]  And so and you know, these these scenes take place in 1996 of of the people who stole this
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:00.040]  tape from them as selling copies of because you couldn't watch tape.
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:04.480]  You couldn't watch video on the web at the time or if you did, it wasn't really it wasn't
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:05.480]  even VHS quality.
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:07.260]  It was so you know, tiny.
[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:12.920]  So the way to sell the way to put a sex tape out in 1996 was to actually sell VHS copies
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:13.960]  of the tape.
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:18.820]  But to do it on the web, you'd send them a check, and then they'd mail you a tape.
[01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:25.280]  But the the thing that it they, you know, and you know, I pay attention to everybody
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:30.440]  listening to the show pays attention to stuff like this, the thing they get right is how
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:34.160]  slow the web was at the time, and they don't cheat.
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:37.840]  And it's like, you're watching these pages load over modems.
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:42.320]  And it's like, everybody who went through this modem era knows, oh, my God, it was so
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:43.700]  incredibly slow.
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:46.920]  And people would just make their web pages as tiny as they could be.
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:52.040]  And we'd compress, you know, use whatever tools we could to shrink a GIF from 15 kilobytes
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:53.480]  to 13 kilobytes.
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:54.640]  That was a win.
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:56.520]  And it still was so terribly slow.
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:02.320]  And I remember having a job interview coming out of college and, and they had a T one line.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:07.280]  And it was the first Wow, I mean, we had some some computers at Drexel University where
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:08.280]  we had that.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:14.920]  But for the most part, when I was in the like the comp sci lab, it was at like a Unix terminal,
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:19.360]  you know, and I'm just staring at a command prompt, I wasn't browsing the web.
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:21.640]  And it was like, Oh, my God, this is so fast.
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:27.920]  But then once you got past modem speeds and got, you know, real internet, you at that
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:33.320]  time, you suddenly it didn't take long, where this thing that felt because you were no longer
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:39.960]  tied to this bandwidth of a modem, you're way faster than that bandwidth wise, you realized
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:42.960]  rendering the web is extremely slow.
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:49.600]  It is just it's just extremely difficult HTML and way what people wanted to build with HTML
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:54.140]  and JavaScript and and what people wanted to build and did build.
[01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:57.920]  And the other thing too, is it's like, you can't just say, Well, we won't, we won't do
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:58.920]  that.
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:03.240]  Because other if other web browsers are rendering this popular web page, that was very difficult
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:08.660]  to render, fine, then you had to to write it, it was competition at work.
[01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:14.080]  But it was, it's incredibly computed, the combination of computers being slow, slow,
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:19.920]  not bandwidth, not modems, but just the actual CPUs being so slow compared to today and web
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:23.680]  pages being ever growing in complexity.
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:25.060]  And the speed really mattered.
[01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:29.840]  And I remember when Safari was announced that it was, you know, to me, it was more interesting,
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:34.040]  like, hey, this is this really is native, I don't, you know, and of course, as Steve
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:39.560]  Jobs was announcing, we didn't know what the underlying rendering engine was yet.
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:44.240]  I think it was, you know, like an email to the KHTML team after you know, which again,
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.240]  I don't want to get into.
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:50.840]  It was like the KHTML team found out about this after it was announced, which is according
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:54.280]  to, you know, that that's within the rights of the license, yes, you know, and that's
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:56.200]  why WebKit was then open source.
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:00.220]  But it was like it dropped as a surprise even to them.
[01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:03.640]  But it was, to me, it was like, oh, my God, it is native, it looks great.
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:04.800]  I love this interface.
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:08.000]  And it renders text well, and the buttons look like Mac buttons.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  But it was fast, fast, fast.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.260]  This is faster than the other browsers.
[01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:14.720]  And it was so important.
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:25.400]  You know, and again, just, you know, total, you know, I, you know, I give, you know, so much credit for Don Melton for figuring out the way that we were going to deliver on that goal.
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:27.200]  But it just comes down to Steve.
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:28.200]  That's what he said.
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:31.240]  And so he said, this thing has to be fast.
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:32.240]  And that was that.
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:37.800]  I mean, there was no real arguing with Steve when he just said very, very clearly what he wanted.
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:44.200]  And just an incredible amount of insight into what, where the web was going.
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:22:09.200]  I mean, you know, don't necessarily, I mean, Apple is not necessarily known, perhaps with good reason, as a company that really maybe understands the web or is, you know, internet native, maybe even, you know, it bears so much of its history as being like this single user system that is, you know, people running Photoshop and Illustrator and other graphics programs by themselves.
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:36.800]  And yet Steve did have this, you know, really, you know, amazing insight into where the future of the web was going, as you just described as people were coming off modems and we're going to be getting faster internet speeds that this was something that he wanted to be a an important part of the overall experience of having, you know, then Apple web browsing experience.
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:45.560]  So Safari ships, WebKit ships, it's a hit, it takes off on the Mac, it's growing, you're working on it for a few years.
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:52.360]  But then long story short, you kind of ended up Peter-principaling yourself, right?
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:23:00.320]  The Peter principle is the adage that employees in an organization rise to the level of their incompetence.
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:04.360]  And you think, oh, well, you think that sounds brutal.
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:05.000]  That can't be right.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:05.720]  But it makes sense.
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:16.360]  Like, if you're really good at your job, and you deserve to be promoted in a well run organization, that will be recognized, and you will get the promotion you deserve.
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:25.920]  And then eventually, you'll get a promotion to a point where you're you're no longer looking like you need another promotion or deserve another promotion.
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:29.880]  You've risen to the level of of your incompetence.
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:33.200]  And maybe in your case, again, it's not maybe not even incompetence.
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:40.360]  It sounds like from your book, it was just you rose to the level of your dissatisfaction, right?
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:53.800]  Yeah, you'd gone to me, I asked for it to write, you asked for a promotion, became a manager and, and very, very quickly discovered that I didn't like it.
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:24:01.920]  It was I just missed coming in every day and worrying about the technology, you know, and realizing.
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:23.160]  After the fact, rather than having, you know, sufficient foresight to understand it, you know, before I made the commitment that when you're a manager, your job is to worry about your people and to make sure that they're productive, that they have what they need so that they can do the the work to make the make the product.
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:33.680]  And I just missed making the technology, but I missed missed coming in and having the difficult, interesting technical problems to solve myself.
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:44.080]  And I just after, you know, maybe two or three months, realized that it was just absolutely not for me.
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:55.040]  And, and so I'll just continue to continue with the story is that I just went and told Scott Forstall, it's like, Scott, this, I'm miserable, and I want out.
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:25:04.200]  And he's like, wait a minute, no, he's like, just three months ago, you committed to me that you're going to take this team on and that you were going to get some good things done.
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:22.480]  And I said, No, it's a way look, I'm willing to resign over it. I understand that I made this commitment to you and that now I'm reneging and that I'm willing to, you know, to, you know, to just leave the company over and I'll go find, you know, a job someplace else, but I feel like I let you down and I'm sorry.
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:46.600]  And he's like, Whoa, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, he was pretty upset with me. But he said, Ken, tell you what, go away. I'm going to work on this. And we'll figure it out. And this is around 2000. This is early 2005. I believe this is in it's actually in it's like in July of 2005.
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:58.120]  Okay, so middle of May, yeah, I'd made the final decision to, you know, to throw myself on the mercy mercy of forestall over the Fourth of July weekend.
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:23.120]  So famously, now, this is where it's all coming together. We, you know, as I've pieced together, not that I've, I'm like Sherlock Holmes, but you know, that by early 2005, at the highest levels, Apple had decided, let's build our own phone. And Scott forestall, obviously, was very, very much aware of that at the time, you had no idea, like, so you're you're meeting with Scott forestall.
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:42.120]  And talking about, you know, the three month old promotion, you would like to promote yourself and do something else. But meanwhile, you know, he's trying to he recognizes he, you know, you know, he'd like to keep you as a productive, you know, that you're you're a good team member to have somewhere.
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:27:10.120]  But meanwhile, in his head is the entire iPhone OS project, which was still at like, the, this sort of germ germ stage, like webkit was when it's you and Don Melton and Williamson, you know, and just like, I don't know, could it be cage tml? Should we build our own thing from scratch? You know, it's, you know, everything is possible, right?
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:14.120]  And so then, then you get you get a knock on the door, right?
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:43.120]  Yeah. So then the so then, Henri Lamoureux, who was reporting to Scott said, Ken, come, come over here, come in my office, close the door. And he said, sign this paper. It's like, okay, so it's like for new project, you sign the paper, I'll tell you what it is. And it's like, okay, so I signed the paper to some paper was an NDA, a non disclosure agreement, you know, that, of course,
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:28:01.120]  everybody at Apple is already under in a non disclosure agreement, blanket non disclosure. So this is the super double secret non disclosure agreement specifically about this project that he was going to tell me about if I sign, so I sign, and I hand the paper back to him.
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:19.120]  And he says, Yep, we're gonna make a cell phone. And that was it. And so then I was on the team. And and it turns out there was about like, maybe six or eight other intrepid engineers, you know, none of us had any experience making cell phones.
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:31.120]  Now, we eventually brought in another team member who did but of the people who made the iOS, the first version, none of us had ever worked on a cell phone before.
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:49.120]  At that point, is has the bake off been completed? Or is the bake off, you know, with, hey, what if we just build our own OS from scratch based on Linux, and it's not cut down from Mac OS X? Is that still going on coincident in July?
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:29:04.120]  Yeah, so to be clear about that, what I what project I signed up for was the effort to shrink down Mac OS X, right to take the desktop OS and to shrink it down so we could run it on this phone.
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:05.120]  Right.
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:17.120]  And then that project was being run by Scott and Scott had deputized, you know, Henri to be the day to day manager, since Scott had lots of other software responsibilities and design responsibilities as well.
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:27.120]  So, so that was part of the effort. So I got to see what became UI kit from a very, very early point.
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:44.120]  And just one of the little, you know, sort of isms that is, you know, fixed in my memory about the about the Apple software development culture is that we used the precursor to Xcode today, which is called project builder, which actually came from next.
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:53.120]  So that was the the development environment, the ID for the development that we were using.
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:30:04.120]  And the way that software works is that whenever you created a new file, it added this header at the top, which the name of the file and the person who created it and the date.
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:18.120]  So I remember that UI view dot M and object to see file for the basic fundamental view abstraction in UI kit was made in May of 2005.
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:41.120]  So it's not, you know, around two months later, I joined but you know, UI kit was already underway. And, but not really much more than two months of work had been done to to to make this shrink down Mac OS 10 version of the iPhone operating system.
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:54.120]  So that's when I joined, that's when I can give you my my best at it at a station that this is the you know, the state of things in you know, at that moment, July of 2005.
[01:30:54.120 --> 01:31:04.120]  And at that point, is your team committed to knowing that it's going to be an entirely touchscreen UI? And it's, you know, not going to Yeah.
[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:19.120]  Oh, yeah, yeah, there was there was. We had prototypes. And I think you you linked to one of the tweets that I that I made of a photograph of one of these prototypes.
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:42.120]  These little plastic touch screens that we, you know, everything at Apple has a code name. And so the code name for these things were wallabies, these little wallaby prototypes that are like, like, you know, kind of like a chunky three and a half inch diagonal screen with a kind of a big thick plastic bezel on it.
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:52.120]  And it was just a touchscreen, it didn't have any compute on board. So we had to take these these wallabies and tether them to a Mac.
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:32:10.120]  And you know, there was this whole USB thing. And there was this bare circuit board, I had a bare circuit board on my desk for a year and a half to interface between the Mac to the wallaby to get everything, you know, get that that touchscreen hardware up and running.
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:24.120]  And this wallaby then showed up on your on my Mac as an external display. So I could be running a prototype version of an iOS app on my Mac.
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:51.120]  And then moved, drag that window over the to the external display, and then pick up the display and start interacting with it using touch. But you know, it things were so provisional things were so you know, we were trying to scrambling so much that there was not even any touch recognition software, we were just using mouse events.
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:33:10.120]  Right. So it was just like, you know, mouse down on that button, you know, the mouse up. And it was months later, by time we actually started addressing the the multi touch capabilities of the of the screen in in, you know, in the iOS software.
[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:22.120]  And so that was the state of play was going to be a, you know, this this full touchscreen was going to be the basis of the whole system.
[01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:43.120]  And so that means you're there, you're on the team, you've signed the extra super double secret NDA, the team is very small, it is very secret. It is obviously got the attend, you must know at this point, it's got the attention of Steve Jobs, literally the, you know, highest levels in the company.
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:34:12.120]  And yet, the Motorola rocker hasn't even been announced yet that gets announced in September. So I don't want to spend time on a rocker, but you didn't work on it, which was a dud. But what was that like, knowing that you're already on this team, and it's, you know, starting to pick up steam, and it's getting it's gone from, you know, in months, it's gone from one empty uiview.m file to, hey, we've got some stuff running, and we've got some ideas here.
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:30.120]  And meanwhile, then in September, there's the you know, the phone and and the thing watching the video again this week that I always forget, is that when Steve Jobs introduced it on stage before he called it the rocker and said it was from Motorola, he said, I want to show you the iTunes phone.
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:55.120]  And, you know, and to his credit, he was trying to sell it, you know, I mean, and what better way, you know, certainly saying we've partnered, you know, if the first words out of his mouth or we've partnered with with Motorola on their new phone, the rocker to have iTunes running on it sounds way less exciting than Steve Jobs in a big keynote in Moscone Hall, saying, I want to show you the iTunes phone.
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:35:12.120]  Because outside Apple, by that time, again, it was a perennial idea that everybody hates their cell phone. Wouldn't it be great if Apple made a cell phone? We honestly that that it sounds simplistic, but that's honestly an inside Apple. That's the same thing.
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:30.120]  Everybody in Apple hated their cell phones, too. Everybody did. Oh, yeah, we're all terrible. Yeah, we did. Yeah, we did. I mean, I can reach on the shelf behind me here. I have a handspring phone with a flip up display there and a nice little chiclet keyboard.
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:45.120]  Yeah, we you know, that was the phone that I had at the time. It's got, you know, the little knobby antenna coming out of the top. Yeah, you know, and, you know, it just was wasn't good enough. So what's your what's your team's take when when the rocker comes out?
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:36:01.120]  Well, look, I you know, it was we always had a sense that, you know, and really thinking of two minds. I mean, look, I'll speak for myself, and I wouldn't be surprised if other people felt the same way, but I can't be sure.
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:17.120]  So I'll just speak for myself and saying that, you know, we really were of two minds in that it's like, yeah, we want a better phone and we think that we're going to make it. But gosh, we're really far from it. And, you know, we we we might fail.
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:32.120]  So that's the really the two minds is we want something better, but we might fail. And so it just kind of seemed and, you know, we're not going to be ready anytime soon. So it just sort of seemed, you know, prudent that someone like Steve is trying to run a big company.
[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:48.120]  And he's he's kind of in some ways hedging his bets. I mean, and hedging them in a couple of different ways in that, you know, ours isn't going to be ready. We need something now. We might fail. You know, what's going to be the best mix?
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:37:12.120]  You know, how are we how is he going to preserve the the best possible future outcomes from Apple, given what he knows right now and some hopeful speculation about what we're going to be able to do. But, you know, it really also does speak to the reality that we had no idea how successful the iPhone was going to turn out to be.
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:32.120]  We weren't even going to be sure that it was going to be successful at all, that we might go and look. This was, you know, you know, at that point, a couple of months later, we were hiring. We were maybe up to, you know, 10 to 15 software engineers and maybe, you know, eight to 10 designers.
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:46.120]  And that was the iOS effort. You know, a couple of executives, a program manager, and that was it. So it's a small handful of people. And so it was a bad and the rocker was another bad.
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:38:03.120]  But a real bet is a bet you can lose, right? If you know you're not going to lose, you're not actually wagering. Like if you, you know, I don't know, this might be a terrible analogy, but if you know that a horse race is fixed, and you place a bet on horse seven, and you know that horse seven is supposed to win, you're not really gambling.
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:18.120]  I guess there's a bit of a gamble of, well, is the horse going to go along with it or whatever, or like, you know, like Pulp Fiction, like a fixed prize fight. What if the guy who's supposed to, you know, take a dive actually knocks the other guy out because he bet against it the other way?
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:37.120]  I mean, so it's a small bet, but it's a different kind of bet. But the real bets, I know this sounds highfalutin like I'm giving people life advice, but if you guys only set out to build a phone that you knew you could make, it's July 2005, you've just joined the team and you're whiteboarding the whole idea.
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:56.120]  And you're saying if every single step of the way was, well, let's only put things on this idea that we know we can do 100% sure we can definitely build this. You don't get the iPhone, right? Like the only way you get the iPhone is to have things and again, to bring it to your story.
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:39:07.120]  You're committed at that point to a complete touchscreen display, and nobody has any idea how you're going to enter text yet. And it's basically, we'll bet that we can figure that out.
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:31.120]  Yes, right. Yes, it was. It was a total bet. There were some early ideas. And the fellow who made the company called Fingerworks that Apple acquired that brought over the multi-touch technology, he had a huge number of responsibilities on his plate to make that part of the system work.
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:46.120]  But Fingerworks previously also had made a hardware keyboard of their own based on multi-touch software, kind of a full desktop form factor, external keyboard.
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:40:05.120]  So the fellow's name is Wayne Westerman, an absolute genius. He was also planning on making the software version of the keyboard, but it was just too much. And that keyboard wasn't coming together fast enough.
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:21.120]  And it's kind of one of the, again, I mentioned before, one of the real secrets of how Apple has made products in the past and the culture of making products that has continued over the long term.
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:38.120]  Software frameworks was one of those keys. One of the other keys is tracking progress and being very, very realistic about how fast the progress is going.
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:51.120]  Being honest, honest with yourselves. Yes. And if progress begins to lag, it doesn't need to lag very long before something is done.
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:41:11.120]  And I think this is, I've heard, and I have no inside knowledge about it, but I've heard the same thing happened at Pixar and has happened with Pixar movies over the years, that a director was changed midstream, that Ratatouille didn't start with Brad Bird directing it.
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:28.120]  He was brought in later because the director who was on there was just not making quick enough progress. And at that point they knew well enough what progress on one of these crazy, you know, difficult, you know, creative technical projects should look like.
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:41.120]  There's a certain amount of messiness that goes on and a certain amount of we're going to figure it out as we go. But beyond a certain point, there's a recognition that this has gone off track. Right.
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:58.120]  But then, and with like with a Pixar movie, there's also like, there's like a window, like, hey, this is our Thanksgiving, you know, whatever year, you know, Disney needs a big family movie at Thanksgiving in this year, you know, 18 months from now. This is it. You know, there is no plan B.
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:23.120]  Yeah. And so at Apple, there was always a, you know, it was always a schedule that we were moving toward. And of course, at that point, you know, Macworld was a was a big event. And so there was always kind of like in this back of our mind, I don't know that I ever could really say for sure that I knew it was going to be January of 2007, way back in the summer or fall of 2005.
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:46.120]  But that, you know, it was always a feeling that, well, somebody has some date in mind and that they're using that date as a as a measuring stick. Right. Counting back from that date, are we going to make it? And everybody's asking everybody every day, are we going to be are we on track? Are we going to make it? Are we going to make that next milestone and so forth?
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:43:02.120]  And so that, you know, in the fall of 2005, there was just a termination that the software keyboard project was not on track and we needed to do something. And so it's really a unique experience in my whole Apple career. Is that just one fine day?
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:16.120]  And we called everybody out into the hallway and said, stop what you're doing. And to be clear, calling all of the software engineers and designers working on iOS and said, OK, stop what you're doing. Everybody starting from now is a keyboard engineer.
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:23.120]  We need to figure this out. We need something different and better than what we have now.
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:35.120]  And so all of us then it's like, well, OK, it's like go get a cup of coffee, go back in your office and sort of close all of the windows that you had open in Project Builder.
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:48.120]  And as I do, whatever you want, get your whiteboard out, get a notebook, you know, open up a new file and start figuring out what what keyboards we might be able to make.
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:54.120]  And, you know, it was just absolutely extraordinary is that the team was was a bunch of generalists.
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:44:06.120]  I mean, if you could just imagine that there were instead a team stocked with people who either came from Nokia or Motorola or, you know, some other company that their cell phone engineers.
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:16.120]  They might not have been so able to do so easy to pivot onto some brand new projects, some new area that they've never thought about just on a moment's notice.
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:31.120]  But we were all just generalists. So it's like, OK, we all had different backgrounds and things, but we were not we we didn't have a particular area of focus other than trying to make the best software possible.
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:38.120]  And so people just did. And in very, very short order, there was a stream of new demos.
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:43.120]  We were inviting each other to teach other's offices. Come on in, have a look at this one.
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:54.120]  What do you think? And it was just this this gurgling cauldron of new ideas for how to enter text using a touch screen.
[01:44:54.120 --> 01:45:02.120]  All right. Let me take a break. I don't want to interrupt you. Well, I do, actually, because I want people to come back after the break because it's such a good it's the high point of the story.
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:05.120]  But let me tell everybody about our third and final sponsor.
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:13.120]  We had remote retool and alas, we lose out on the third cherry of another sponsor with a re in front of their name.
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:23.120]  It's Squarespace. I'm going to call them up and I'm going to suggest they rename the company re Squarespace just to just to make this episode perfect.
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:27.120]  But in the meantime, they're still Squarespace. And you've probably heard of them.
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:41.120]  They are the all in one platform for building your brand and growing your business online. Stand out with your own beautiful website, engage with your audience and sell anything, your products, the content you create, even your time.
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:56.120]  They've got some great features. They've got member areas where you can unlock a new revenue stream for your business and free up time by accessing selling access to gated material like videos or courses or newsletters for paying members.
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:46:06.120]  It all goes through Squarespace analytics. They have analytics built in with one of the best designed analytics dashboards I've ever seen.
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:16.120]  It is so clear. And instead of looking like an airplane cockpit, like most analytics things do, it's like looking at a really nice cars dashboard with just what you really want to know.
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:29.120]  It's so good. Online stores, anything you want to sell. They handle everything from stuff like inventory to the actual commerce and processing of the payments.
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:46.120]  It's also it's all so easy to use. They've got custom templates, best in class, professionally designed templates that you can just use as is with almost as many styles as you can imagine to choose from that look great on everything from phones to big desktops.
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:59.120]  And you can customize them a little or customize them a lot or build your own template for scratch if that's what you want to do. Everything is easy to use and you can get started so quickly.
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:05.120]  So what you do is you go to Squarespace dot com slash talk show Squarespace dot com slash talk show.

[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:33.120]  So effectively, there's there's a bake off on keyboards. It is sort of an intramural kind of like a science fair contest.
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:39.120]  Yeah, one of it's one of my I don't want to spoil. I don't want to I don't know. I want people who haven't read your book to read the book.
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:48.120]  I don't want to spoil so much. And we can talk about things that aren't in the book. But I love this part of the story where.
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:48:03.120]  It basically you guys were everybody on the team was supposed to implement their keyboard is like part of a like a framework, again, to use the framework where it could be plugged in and within the same demo on the same device.
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:11.120]  Everybody's keyboards could just, you know, if there's 10 keyboards to demo and you're presenting them to Scott for stall, you could just go through on the same device.
[01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:22.120]  One, two, three, four. And, you know, whoever's number four is can introduce it and say, look, it's like a wheel. And you do go out from the middle and your yours didn't fit in the framework.
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:42.120]  No, no. Yeah. So I was a bad student and I didn't complete the assignment because, well, you know, I wound up rewriting from scratch like three or four times by that point.
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:52.120]  And it's it's it was like, well, you know, I think maybe if I rewrite it once more, I could I could maybe get something that really works.
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:59.120]  Either the dictionary was too slow or the you know, the touch handling was no good. And I figure I really need this one more rewrite.
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:09.120]  And I could either take my current version and and figure out how to get it integrated into that framework that you mentioned, or I could do this rewrite.
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:28.120]  And it decided to do the rewrite. And I think the keyboard came out pretty good. But what then just happened is that there was going to need to be a step where I was going to need to get, you know, take the the prototype out of Scott for stalls hands, you know, to go over to the Mac and run a new command and then hand the thing back to him.
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:39.120]  So it was just, you know, the people organizing the demo wanted to avoid that. And so I went last and, you know, it kind of got down to the end of the demo.
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:50.120]  And, you know, Kim Vorath, who was running the the the project, said, well, Scott, that's it. That's all the keyboards in the demo. And I was like, wait, wait, no, no, no.
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:58.120]  I still have mine to go. And, you know, it was, you know, it's so funny how, you know, history kind of turns on.
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:07.120]  Well, if Scott had gotten a phone call right at that moment or he decided, no, I've seen enough, he could have just left the room and I never would have gotten a chance to show my demo.
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:30.120]  But I did. And he liked it right away. And, you know, he, you know, the forestall is just, you know, is so smart and just is so quick to get down to the to what question should he ask that would tell him the most information.
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:42.120]  And so I talked to him years later and he said, Ken, he wanted to know, he can't even see it, like asked me what is what is going on in the software here.
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:57.120]  And I said, oh, well, I'm looking at your touches and I'm trying to figure out what you wanted. He says, like from that moment sold, he said, you had figured out how to make software a part of the text entry experience,
[01:50:57.120 --> 01:51:10.120]  because, of course, for the most part, you know, there's some low level software going on, say, in the, you know, the MacBook Pro keyboard sitting in front of me to marry up the keys to the software that processes them.
[01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:18.120]  But it's not sophisticated software in terms of what it's doing. It's just they're processing events from the hardware.
[01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:28.120]  Whereas the, you know, the breakthrough that that I came up with on that earliest keyboard was to say, no, I'm actually going to look at what you might mean.
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:39.120]  Look at what you did and try to match those things up to give the desired result. And that was enough for him. So I got the job. I became the DRI.
[01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:53.120]  But as you've mentioned in the book, part of the scary part about going last in any sort of like, hey, we've got an hour to demo projects to Scott Forstall. If you're going last, the risk is, well, what if Scott was late because of something else he had to do?
[01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:57.120]  You know, as you said, he was he was at least a little busy.
[01:51:57.120 --> 01:52:10.120]  As I it's as I inserted into my timeline, which I think is fascinating in hindsight, 2005 was also when Apple announced the move from PowerPC to Intel processors for the Mac, which guess what was a big deal.
[01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:18.120]  Yeah, there's lots going on. So Scott could be late, but he still has to leave at the end of the scheduled time for the next meeting because he's got something else.
[01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:30.120]  Or Scott could leave early because maybe his phone goes off and somebody says, hey, is Steve wants you? And you know, when Steve would call, Steve would just call him directly and just say, hey, come here. I got to talk to you about something.
[01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:37.120]  And guess what? When Steve Jobs call Scott Forstall and says, I need to talk to you about something, Scott Forstall goes and talks to Steve Jobs. Right.
[01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:50.120]  And I again, you know, like I said, maybe, you know, you don't hire Williamson, maybe WebKit's not based on KHTML, you know, maybe Steve Jobs call Scott Forstall. Maybe we have a different keyboard.
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:53:00.120]  I mean, and again, it's not like, oh, you were just a rando off the street who this was your own, you know, your only screen test. You were an employee on a small team.
[01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:09.120]  You might've had a chance to show him the keyboard subsequently. Sure. But it still makes these things just, yeah, it really does.
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:28.120]  It just, I just remember in that, that moment of, of, you know, you never really, you know, you want to make a scene in a demo with Scott or, you know, never with Steve, but not even with Scott, you know, it's, it's, it's a high stakes.
[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:39.120]  It's a high stakes moment. And so, you know, sort of pressing and pushing to say, no, no, no, I have this other demo to show felt like it was a little bit of a risk, but it was a risk that paid off.
[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:51.120]  You tell the story of demoing it for Phil Schiller the first time. And at the time, your, your, your keyboard had, instead of having a discreet onscreen key for all 26 letters of the alphabet, there were groups.
[01:53:51.120 --> 01:54:10.120]  So like K W E was one key. I think that's what it was. Cause you know, Q W E of course the first three. And then you would press that key for any word that with a Q W or E and press, you know, other keys that either had two or three letters on them.
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:23.120]  So they were bigger touch targets. And then the dictionary would figure out, well, out of all these possibilities, the first letter is either a Q W or an E the second letter is either a J K or L or whatever.
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:32.120]  What's, what's the most likely possibility, but it looked weird. And I think that, and basically your demo for Phil Schiller with the first keyboard was like two minutes.
[01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:47.120]  Like you're braced for like, Oh my God, it's Phil Schiller. He's, you know, he's got this reputation. He's got strong opinions, you know, good taste. This could be a night, you know, maybe not even a nightmare, but this could be like an hour long slog of arguing over details or defending my actions.
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:55:07.120]  And instead it's two minutes and he was like, man, but, but what comes away from me in the book and it's what I love about your attitude and what I think made you so successful and maybe typical for the apple mentality is rather than take it personally.
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:21.120]  Like, huh, huh. How about that? I've been slaving over this for so long, laboring over this for so long. And he just took two minutes and walked away, but you took it and thought, huh, something didn't impress him.
[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:30.120]  And it's like, well, he's Phil Schiller. He cares about how things look, how it's going to look on stage when it's demoed. And if it looks weird, that's, that's off. Right.
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:40.120]  It's off for Apple for something to look weird. Right. And it started sort of this, not a bump demo, but like, like a surprise demo like this.
[01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:53.120]  I can't believe it was only two minutes. This is so important. And instead it spurs you to think, huh, and it gets your gears turning to and then I think you said it was Greg Christie, who's just like, how about you just make each letter a key?
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:56:01.120]  You know, I'm not going to do a Greg Christie. You know, Greg Christie is, I love the guy to death. I've met him a few times.
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:13.120]  He's just, he, he is, you know, he is a wonderful, you know, the warm, supportive person to, to work for once you get to know him.
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:23.120]  But he is very, very gruff on the exterior and, and, you know, he's from New York and he's very, very direct in his communication style.
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:28.120]  So we were sitting in a meeting one time and he's just, oh, come on, Ken K, you just put, make one key for every letter.
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:33.120]  And that's like light bulb. That's it. All right. Yeah.
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:44.120]  And so, you know, you do, you went and described, you know, how that earlier software worked, whereas this group, you know, this, this key that had this group of letters on them.
[01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:51.120]  And that when you press that key, so it was a nice big touch target. So you could, you could, you could hit the key reliably.
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:55.120]  You're going to get, you were going to get one of those three letters.
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:57:08.120]  And so look, all I did was I chopped up the graphics so that it looked like you were getting, you were tapping only one of those keys, but underneath the software was doing the same game.
[01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:21.120]  And as a matter of fact, it even did more because when each letter was on, you know, when three letters was on one key, you were only going to get that letter because the keys were large enough targets to hit.
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:28.120]  And once I made the key smaller, I started taking into account keys that were letters that were above and below.
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:37.120]  And so I made, you know, the kind of these dynamic sets of keys, but creating the illusion that you were only tapping one key. And that was enough.
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:48.120]  That was enough to, you know, give people an impression that it, the, the keyboard was something that they could understand the first time that they approached it.
[01:57:48.120 --> 01:58:04.120]  I love the story of the keyboard. I think it makes such a great example. And again, the book is, as you said, 80,000 words. It goes into much detail, but sometimes you need a smaller example or a concrete example to exemplify a principle.
[01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:20.120]  And I have always thought, again, not saying this just because, you know, you and I are pals and you're on my show here, but I do think that the iPhone keyboard exemplifies everything Steve Jobs said on stage about why make the whole phone a touchscreen.
[01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:34.120]  Which is, look, you know, once you put hardware buttons on it, the hardware is there forever or until you make a new device. Whereas we know how to make something that changes with new ideas that we haven't even had yet.
[01:58:34.120 --> 01:58:48.120]  It's called software, right? And the keyboard itself exemplifies that. But the other thing I really love about the iPhone keyboard in hindsight is that it looks at first like the most obvious idea in the world.
[01:58:48.120 --> 01:59:13.120]  Starting in a world where Blackberries and Blackberry type phones were at that point the best selling smartphones, right? If you wanted to do a phone that did like email and messaging, you were getting a Blackberry or a phone that looked like a Blackberry, which had an actual 26 keys for all letters of the alphabet and punctuation in the space bar, and you actually click them with your thumb.
[01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:26.120]  And at first glance, that's what the iPhone keyboard looks like. It just looks like a touchscreen version of that, which is like the most obvious thing to do. It doesn't look clever at first, it looks like the most obvious thing possible.
[01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:45.120]  And all of the other differences, the affordances, the well, but we don't get, you know, with a Blackberry keyboard, you actually do get to engage one of your senses touch, right? So your thumbs are covering the keys, which is, you know, not not what you want, but it's what has to happen with thumb typing.
[01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:56.120]  But because you can feel as you move from the S to the A that you're on the next button to the left, you know to press, whereas you're never going to get that touch. You have no sense. You're never going to get that.
[01:59:56.120 --> 02:00:13.120]  Right. Yeah, man. And it really is way down in your nervous system when you you're feeling the edge of something on your finger. I'm not even sure that like your cerebral cortex is getting involved. Right. I mean, it's like pull your hand off the hot stove.
[02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:20.120]  Well, they always say they say that that takes place that takes place faster than you know, you've burned yourself, your hands already yanked back.
[02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:33.120]  That's right. And that that deep, tactile sense is so baked in. So much of our nervous system is given over to the sense of touch on our on our hands and on our fingertips.
[02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:49.120]  And so taking that away on the on the glass needed something to replace it. And that turned out to be auto correction software. But we didn't know that there was it was it was something that we needed to discover through this, you know, sort of arduous seeming.
[02:00:49.120 --> 02:01:03.120]  I mean, it wasn't that long. It wasn't like it was a years long research project. But I'll tell you, in the day to day going through it, and the stress of having to, you know, sort of, you know, save your project, you know, we didn't want to get canceled. We wanted this phone.
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:07.120]  And so well, it seemed like it was a lot of pressure.
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:26.120]  It wasn't like you were working on an obscure part of the of the OS, right? I mean, everybody, no matter, no matter what you were going to use the iPhone for, you were going to encounter this keyboard. And there was a state of the art, which was the Blackberry style hardware keyboard, which is obviously what it was going to be compared against.
[02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:40.120]  And the other factor that that complicates that is that the, you know, crackberries, or whatever you'd call the the addicted, the people who are addicted to their Blackberries, develop the ability to type very fast on their Blackberries, right?
[02:01:40.120 --> 02:02:00.120]  So, you know, there, it's not just Oh, everybody has hardware keyboards, it's everybody has these hardware keyboards that people can learn to type fast on. And so it sets the bar, right? And then we get back to, like, Internet Explorer on Windows rendering speed versus Safari.
[02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:11.120]  Well, there's the bar, because here it is, it's on, it's on your desk, I have a PC setup running the latest version of Windows with IE, and here's how fast they rendered the New York Times homepage.
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:34.120]  And here's Blackberry, here's how fast some people can type on it, what can we do, and then you come up with these ideas that that are impossible on a physical keyboard, like when you press the S key on the iPhone keyboard, and a popover appears above your thumb or finger, however you choose to type, I shouldn't say thumb because my wife is a is a finger typer.
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:03:03.120]  It, there's no way to do that in hardware to confirm, hey, you know, I, you know, the keyboard thinks you just hit an S, you know, and there it is S, I mean, right? How many at this point, honestly, I you get up past billions, and it's hard to know how many trillions, possibly whatever comes after trillions of key presses on iPhone keyboards and Android keyboards that use that same design of when you you know, it looks like a QWERTY keyboard.
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:17.120]  And your finger or thumb hits the letter and a popover shows up above so you actually can see what it thinks you hit. How many key presses have been made at this point? It's or how many have been made while we're recording this show around the world?
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:31.120]  Yeah, a lot. You know, that's it's one of the danger aspects for me of this show is that people are going to have a better idea that that's me to blame for all of that.
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:04:00.120]  I wanted I got to bring this home soon. But I want to I want to tell you a story that I heard from somebody at Apple, who would know. But I can't say who but years ago, basically, part of the drama of you guys putting a stripped down version of OS 10 on a cell phone in 2006 2007 is that at that time, Mac OS 10 wasn't that fast on PC.
[02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:18.120]  Hardware, right? And especially Yeah, go back to 2002. When Mac OS 10 first shipped to the public, it was dreadfully slow compared to 2001 or 2001. Well, 2002 to I mean, I would say it was at least two years yet. Yeah.
[02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:43.120]  Yeah. I talked to somebody who said they knew all along that the way that you know, and it was slow because aqua was so ambitious with the drop shadows and all the text anti alias and the transparency and everything that made it quote unquote, lickable, and made it look Wow, made it slow to like, hit the file menu in an app and watch the menu drop down.
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:05:08.120]  And what I was told was that Apple, starting even before Mac OS 10, it shipped had a had a lab where they were, they had a bunch of tests like drop down menus and applications, dragon, you know, the latency between dragging an icon and you know, does it track the mouse one to one, and measuring it down to like the hundredth of a second, and comparing it against Windows XP.
[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:28.120]  And I think a lot like the early days of Safari getting blown away by IE on Windows, Mac OS 10. The difference is Mac OS 10 actually shipped like that. And for years, and every major version of Mac OS 10 got faster and faster. But they still had this benchmark of is it as snappy as Windows XP? And the answer was no.
[02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:51.120]  So there was this bar, which to me is not just for Apple, but anybody when you have a bar above you, you know, it's such a better motivator than once you're the bar. You know? Yeah. But what I was told, here's what I was told, though, is when Windows Vista shipped, and I forget what year that was, but 2006 or seven or something like that.
[02:05:51.120 --> 02:06:10.120]  The people who, you know, who were aware of this benchmark for testing the speed of the OS didn't know what to do, because Vista got slower than XP. And it was less snappy. And the decision was made, well, we're going to keep testing against XP. That's our benchmark.
[02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:32.120]  And I think it speaks a lot because it was sort of like being able to cheat and say, well, now we're not as slow as we used to be because we'll run against this new version of Windows, which is slower. But one of the big this is where I'm going with it is, to me, a big difference between the original iPhone and the first version of Mac OS 10 is that the first version of Mac OS 10.
[02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:50.120]  Like if you dragged a window around, it dragged the whole window without an outline, like and for people who are younger or never used classic Mac OS, when you drag a window in Mac in a classic Mac OS, what you dragged was just an outline of the window to show where it would go.
[02:06:50.120 --> 02:07:09.120]  And then when you let go, the window would redraw in the new spot. And so it didn't actually you weren't seeing the actual window move around. And when Mac OS 10 shipped, and it did it, that's a cool idea. But you saw this shearing, you know, it the video couldn't the performance couldn't keep up with it.
[02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:25.120]  And when you scrolled, it scrolled live. But the contents of a complex document or a web page couldn't keep up. If it scrolled slow, even though it scrolled with visual fidelity, it looked cool, but felt slow.
[02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:44.120]  iPhone did something very, very, to me, that was so clever was like, and you'd noticed it most in Safari is like when you would scroll in Safari, the scroll view would always track your finger no matter how fast you scrolled. And if it couldn't keep up, it would just render a checkerboard.
[02:07:44.120 --> 02:07:46.120]  Yeah, that's my idea.
[02:07:46.120 --> 02:07:49.120]  Was it really? Was that in the book? Did I miss that?
[02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:53.120]  I don't know. I don't think that didn't make it in the book. I don't think that idea.
[02:07:53.120 --> 02:08:10.120]  Well, then I'm asking the right person, because yeah, it was sacra instead of making, putting as the top priority, visual fidelity and making make it as fast as possible. The second priority, the top priority was always keep up with the finger. Is that right?
[02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:28.120]  Yeah, absolutely. And this, I did write this in the book, that directive came from, and was best exemplified by the demo that Imran Chaudhry would give.
[02:08:28.120 --> 02:08:41.120]  And you have to kind of understand a little bit about the way the team was organized, how design and engineering collaborated with each other is that there was this software engineering team working on iOS.
[02:08:41.120 --> 02:09:08.120]  So the iOS software team, and then there was the human interface team, the HI team, who had broad responsibilities for iOS and macOS and, you know, a whole lot of projects. And so, and at the time, there was a clear mandate that if HI asked for something,
[02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:27.120]  it was the duty of the engineering team to do their best to deliver it. There just was no question as to, you know, the engineers want X, the HI team wants Y, and now there's going to be some sort of reconciliation, whether we do X or Y or both.
[02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:38.120]  It's like, no, no, no, no, no. What the HI team asks for, they get to the extent possible within the bounds of physics, right?
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:52.120]  And so this demo that Imran would give is that he would take just a blank sheet of paper on a clear table, and he would put the piece of paper down and then put his finger in the middle of the piece of paper.
[02:09:52.120 --> 02:10:07.120]  And he would move the piece of paper around, glide the piece of paper around on the tabletop. And he would say, piece of paper is not jumping. It's not skipping. It's tracking my finger exactly.
[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:21.120]  That's what the pixels need to be like on the iPhone. It needs to feel like those pixels have a physicality to them, that they're just pinned under your finger and that you can control them.
[02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:33.120]  If there's ever any lag or skip or judder, it breaks the illusion. And we don't want that. It just is not part of the design that we're aiming for.
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:43.120]  And so we couldn't deliver that in the web browser with full fidelity, scrolling the content. And so I just came up with this idea.
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:54.120]  I was like, okay, well, there's going to be this under layer, underneath the web content that if we can't draw there, you're just going to see this checkerboard.
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:11:07.120]  And I actually have to pretty sure that even at that time, Photoshop had a similar sort of idea. It says, I'm just going to do that. I'm just going to do that for the web browser.
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:17.120]  So I'm glad you appreciate that. But it was to meet that design goal where we don't break the illusion.
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:29.120]  Well, the Photoshop idea to me was always, and I don't know, maybe again, I think for most of us, we never read the manuals. Maybe they explained it somewhere, but I never read the Photoshop manual.
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:40.120]  I was self-taught. But to me, it was always, and as a budding UI designer and lover and fast, somebody fascinated by it, it was like, how do you render nothing?
[02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:57.120]  Right. And it's like, what color is water? And I remember one time in school, like a science teacher asked that once, and the kid he picked was, I think he purposefully picked a kid who he thought would give the answer he wanted, which was that the kid said white.
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:06.120]  And he said, no, it's not white. And he put something colored behind the glass of water, you know, and if it was red, then you could see red through there. You know, it's clear.
[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:17.120]  But how do you render clear? You can't render clear on a screen. And so Photoshop came up with this checkerboard. If you delete everything, you can't just show white because white might be the actual background you want.
[02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:30.120]  So the checkerboard was sort of nothing. Right. And I love that. It's kind of right. I mean, it's like, you know, of course you can. None of these little hacks are ever perfect because what if the web page is a checkerboard?
[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:50.120]  Right. So, I mean, you know, there's, there's always, there's always one, you know, you know, one ideal case, I mean, you know, where, where it could frustrated, it could, it could ruin the illusion, but it is just an illusion. It's just like you're, you're saying, you know, this is, this is, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's a trick.
[02:12:50.120 --> 02:13:13.120]  And, you know, trying to figure out what the right set of tricks are, what the right trade offs are, you know, you mentioned that there is this, this decision, which, which I'm glad that you that, that I guess I'm not surprised that communicated to you that, you know, the iOS, it just keeps up with your finger the whole time.
[02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:32.120]  It's like, that's something that we didn't want to get, give up on. And so we came up with a hack. It's, it's a good hack, but, but it's some, some bit of, of, of where, where the, you know, one part of the illusion breaks in order to keep another one stood up.
[02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:53.120]  And, you know, trying to design and, and trying to figure out what, what the right set, a set of trade offs is, I think is a big part of what has made, you know, Apple products so joyful to use over such a long period of time is because there's people there who care about it and have been caring about it for a long, long time.
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:14:16.120]  Recognizing that trade offs are often not just between good and better, but sometimes between a thing that's good and a thing that's bad. Right? So with the Mac OS X style, where nothing was ever checkerboarded and everything was always WYSIWYG, it looked cool and at the time was revolutionary for a computer.
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:28.120]  But it felt slow, whereas you'd never wanted to see the checkerboard, the checkerboard itself. I'm talking about how cool I thought it was. You're saying it was a clever idea you had, but you certainly, you never wanted to see it right.
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:39.120]  And Apple worked hard year after year to get it to the point where I forget at what point the checkerboard never stopped showing up in Safari. And it was always capable of rendering everything in real speed.
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:48.120]  It was only a handful of years. You know, it's, it's, yeah, surely there's a lot of people out here listening who don't even remember having an iPhone.
[02:14:48.120 --> 02:15:05.120]  Because it was just a few years because you couldn't wait to get rid of it. You hated it. But if you had to make the choice between a thing that was like, we give up on painting in real time, but that checkerboard is going to track your index finger one to one as fast as you move your index finger.
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:19.120]  Yeah, it was just, I, and I think part of the, uh, the, the trade off was we need to sell people on this notion of a touchscreen operating system.
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:27.120]  And so, you know, we, we decided to make the guarantee that it's going to feel like a physical object to you.
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:47.120]  And that was just going to be a part of what made people feel comfortable about it. I mean, but, you know, do you, you know, when you're, when you're making systems, you know, so often, uh, you know, I felt over the years that, um, uh, if, if I don't do a good enough job, people are going to take that product and they're going to want to throw it out the window.
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:59.120]  Certainly felt that with the keyboard, you know, uh, and it says, uh, what can I do to avoid that? Uh, you know, and, uh, you know, so long, even throughout the development of projects, things aren't good.
[02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:11.120]  You know, the funny thing is that if the project was good at any time, the executives and the marketers and the operations people would figure out how to ship the thing early if you were done ahead of time.
[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:23.120]  Right. And so it never really is that it's like during the, you know, the middle of a development cycle, things aren't good. A lot of stuff is broken features aren't implemented.
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:30.120]  They're not, uh, some of them are, and some of them aren't, but it's like, you know, a is implemented B isn't.
[02:16:30.120 --> 02:16:53.120]  And so that also means that C is broken because it depends on B, even though the rest of it is there and waiting for B to be finished, you know, and you just wind up with this, this whole, uh, you know, uh, Gantt set of Gantt charts, you know, that if you were to model it that way, where there's all of these dependencies and the system just doesn't work.
[02:16:53.120 --> 02:17:08.120]  It doesn't feel like it's come together, um, until you get, start to get closer and more things get done. And so there's always this, this, uh, you know, this game that you play as you're going is saying, well, what am I going to be able to get done in time?
[02:17:08.120 --> 02:17:17.120]  Uh, can I do something like the checkerboard that maybe is a stop gap and we wind up saying, well, that's a good enough stop gap. We're going to be able to ship now.
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:38.120]  And so it's this, this whole sort of multi-generate, uh, uh, excuse me, multi-dimensional multi-dimensional game that you're trying to play to figure out, well, where is this sweet spot in this huge set of, of inter, you know, uh, intersecting features and, and, uh, capabilities.
[02:17:38.120 --> 02:17:43.120]  So, I mean, it's, it certainly isn't science. It's, it's much, it's, it's an art.
[02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:50.120]  So how big of a mess is everything at humane right now?
[02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:56.120]  I, I, I, I, I'm not going to give you an answer to that.
[02:17:56.120 --> 02:18:10.120]  Stop stammering. Stop stammering. You were already kind enough at the beginning of the show, before I could even ask you the obligatory question, you already said, we're not talking about whatever it is that you and your colleagues are working on.
[02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:15.120]  Here's something, here's something that I will say about huge humane is that we're hiring.
[02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:24.120]  So if you're, if you're interested, um, so I'll, I'll give you a link for the, for the show notes.
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:37.120]  Uh, and, um, yeah, we've, we've got a lot of interesting work and it's, um, it's interesting, interesting and fascinating enough that I went into it, you know, I, I, I'm enjoying it very, very much.
[02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:47.120]  You took a meeting on a Saturday, so it's engaging, but that is good. You have something to promote for humane. They're hiring. We will put a link, I promise in the show notes.
[02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:59.120]  Uh, the other thing we can talk about, which people can enjoy right now, current work is your game up spell, which is, it's sort of, it was my pandemic project.
[02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:03.120]  It's your pandemic project. It's a word game for the iPhone surprise.
[02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:11.120]  Uh, it's very enjoyable. It is sort of the anti wordle because wordle has no clock.
[02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:21.120]  And the whole point of up spell is you get like, uh, like the, you get two minutes, you get a tile of letters like Scrabble and you make words and out of the letters.
[02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:24.120]  And then when you think you have a good word, you push it up.
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:35.120]  That's the up and then those tiles get replaced by other tiles and you try to make another word and you push it up and you try to make as many words as you can in two minutes with every time you use a word, the tiles get reloaded.
[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:42.120]  It is very fun to play. If you like word games, I will also put a link to it in the show notes, but that's thank you.
[02:19:42.120 --> 02:19:49.120]  But you know, it's, it's good to have something else to, to, to, uh, to pimp for lack of a better word.
[02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:57.120]  And last, last but not least, your book Creative Selection is, we've only scratched the surface, thank God.
[02:19:57.120 --> 02:20:02.120]  I don't know what in the world made me think that a two plus hour podcast would spoil the whole book.
[02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:16.120]  It's nowhere even close to it. But if you thought this conversation was interesting and you haven't read Creative Selection, my God, go run, don't walk or just go to your Kindle or your iBook store and get it.
[02:20:16.120 --> 02:20:24.120]  But the website for it is creativeselection.io. That's probably the best place to send people with links there that you can buy.
[02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:30.120]  Cannot recommend this book highly enough. And I deeply, deeply thank you for your time here, Ken.
[02:20:30.120 --> 02:20:33.120]  I got to have you back on the show. We've got too many other stories to tell.
[02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:35.120]  I had a great time.
[02:20:35.120 --> 02:20:43.120]  It's easier. The second, it's easier for me to get you on the second time or because I had, now I know, I know, I, you know, I've, I've,
[02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:47.120]  Well, you can, you can always find me on the watch channel.
[02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:51.120]  We didn't even begin to talk about our shared love.
[02:20:51.120 --> 02:21:03.120]  Our shared love of watches and close listeners to the talk show will, will, you may remember that a couple of episodes ago, John mentioned that he had this crazy signal channel.
[02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:07.120]  That was the only thing he was using the app for because he had a couple of friends.
[02:21:07.120 --> 02:21:16.120]  Well, it's, it was the, why it's the watch channel that, that we have and with me and a couple of other pals and we've actually moved it to iMessage now.
[02:21:16.120 --> 02:21:19.120]  What do you think of that? Is that a good change?
[02:21:19.120 --> 02:21:21.120]  No, I don't think so.
[02:21:21.120 --> 02:21:23.120]  I don't think so either. I think we should go back.
[02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:28.120]  I think we should go back to signal. Here's why. Because the watch channel, here's why.
[02:21:28.120 --> 02:21:36.120]  And me piping up about it here secretly before or, or in joke wise before got it to move to iMessage.
[02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:44.120]  But now let's just be explicit that I think we should move it back because it's not the sort of thing any of us on it need to stay up to date on.
[02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:50.120]  I don't need instant alerts. It's like, Hey, let me check what's up with the guys on the watch channel.
[02:21:50.120 --> 02:21:57.120]  And so I think it's better segregated, whereas everything else I have on iMessage is generally stuff I do want to see right away.
[02:21:57.120 --> 02:22:07.120]  So it's sort of spoiling my iMessage. And then the other thing selfishly is that we're busy enough on our little watch channel that it gets me looking at signal.
[02:22:07.120 --> 02:22:15.120]  And I publish my signal number for readers of Daring Fireball to contact me securely and privately and which is great for that.
[02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:23.120]  But I don't, people don't, it turns out to be not, it doesn't get used that frequently, but now I don't check signal at all.
[02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:32.120]  And I even this past week, right, I had a message pending from somebody and I wish I had seen it sooner.
[02:22:32.120 --> 02:22:36.120]  It didn't ruin, you know, I didn't lose, you know, a sponsor or anything, you know, along those lines.
[02:22:36.120 --> 02:22:43.120]  It wasn't like I lost business, but it's like, Oh, I would have answered that 48 hours ago, but I stopped looking at signal because the watch group isn't on it.
[02:22:43.120 --> 02:22:53.120]  But anyway, we could do a whole show about it.
[02:22:53.120 --> 02:22:59.120]  Thank you, Ken. This was absolutely a blast. And I do look forward to having you on again.
[02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:17.120]  Let me just say before we go, my thanks to our sponsors, Squarespace, a.k.a. Resquarespace and Remote, where you can use them to hire workers in countries around the world and retool the visual prototyping.
[02:23:17.120 --> 02:23:25.120]  Build your own actual from prototype to actual shipping usable Web apps for your your teams.
[02:23:25.120 --> 02:23:35.120]  Great, great, great sponsors, one and all. Thanks, Ken.
