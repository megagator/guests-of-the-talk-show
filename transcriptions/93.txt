[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  This is gonna be an interesting conversation
[00:02.800 --> 00:09.280]  Yeah, because we we're just totally freaking guessing about everything. I you know, it's funny. I'm not
[00:10.640 --> 00:18.740]  Totally guessing it's it is it is easily maybe the the thing I wrote about iphone screen sizes is maybe the most john gruberian
[00:19.600 --> 00:21.600]  thing i've ever written like it's
[00:22.160 --> 00:27.280]  Not totally out of the blue, but it's absolutely positively not informed by a single person
[00:27.280 --> 00:30.640]  Who's actually seen or touched a new iphone, right?
[00:32.880 --> 00:34.880]  But
[00:36.000 --> 00:37.200]  But
[00:37.200 --> 00:41.840]  I have talked to some people who claim to have talked to people who have seen or touched new iphones, right?
[00:42.880 --> 00:44.880]  So it's it's not you know
[00:46.000 --> 00:49.520]  the big one the big one and the one that uh, and we can
[00:50.800 --> 00:55.440]  I don't know. I think we'll do a good job of trying to explain this thing some of these things to everybody
[00:55.440 --> 00:59.940]  But the one that to me is weird is this idea of a 750 by 1334?
[01:00.880 --> 01:02.400]  iphone
[01:02.400 --> 01:04.400]  because
[01:04.720 --> 01:11.360]  If that's the pixel count you divide by two to get the points and it they're both odd numbers
[01:12.060 --> 01:14.060]  375 by 667
[01:15.360 --> 01:17.360]  Yeah, and and that's a little
[01:18.080 --> 01:22.240]  weird not quite as weird as a phone that had odd pixels, but
[01:22.240 --> 01:24.320]  Odd points is a little bit weird
[01:26.320 --> 01:33.840]  Well, the one that you're thinking for the uh, the 4.7 inch display, you know, that's the one yeah 1334 by
[01:34.400 --> 01:36.400]  750 that's just
[01:42.000 --> 01:48.960]  Yeah, exactly well, you know for people who are out there and probably not going well what's the matter odd numbers even numbers
[01:48.960 --> 01:52.880]  Odd numbers even numbers all programming is like binary
[01:53.600 --> 01:54.640]  Right
[01:54.640 --> 01:57.040]  It's powers of two on and off
[01:57.840 --> 01:59.840]  You know, everything is nicely
[02:00.560 --> 02:05.760]  You know, you can do a division by two by just shifting a binary digit, you know one
[02:06.560 --> 02:10.880]  place to the right everything is just kind of really nice when it's
[02:12.080 --> 02:14.080]  You know some fact or some power of two
[02:14.080 --> 02:18.080]  We start talking about a three. It's like oh
[02:19.360 --> 02:23.520]  And it's just in some ways. It's a little arbitrary. I mean the factor of two the
[02:24.400 --> 02:26.400]  Factors of two is our magic numbers
[02:26.640 --> 02:32.900]  I've been talking to jonas about that and he's actually gotten that down with the minecraft playing because everything in minecraft is so pixel-y
[02:33.440 --> 02:38.160]  that eight and sixteen and thirty-two are numbers that keep coming up in minecraft and I
[02:38.480 --> 02:40.960]  Sort of it was an interesting conversation, but I was like, you know
[02:40.960 --> 02:45.120]  You're gonna find out as you you know, get more and more into video games and stuff that those are
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.760]  Those powers of two when you keep doubling their magic numbers, but even so even just avoiding the powers of two thing
[02:53.520 --> 02:59.200]  It it's just a little weird because you can always split a screen in half and have two equal halves
[02:59.360 --> 03:05.200]  But if you have an odd number now, you can't right right that that really is the root of the problem, right?
[03:05.280 --> 03:08.400]  It's like and how do you center something at that point, right?
[03:08.400 --> 03:11.520]  It's uh, you know, what's half of six sixty seven?
[03:13.040 --> 03:16.880]  You know, what do you do with that extra 0.5 of a pixel do you right, you know?
[03:17.680 --> 03:22.000]  And it's you know, or not 0.5 of a pixel is 0.5 of point, right?
[03:23.040 --> 03:30.080]  And you know, it's a little bit arbitrary because if you have an even number of points you can always center an even
[03:30.480 --> 03:34.160]  Sized object, but you couldn't center an odd type to object now
[03:34.160 --> 03:39.520]  It's the other way around now you can take an odd sized object and put that odd pixel right in the middle of the screen
[03:40.080 --> 03:41.600]  So it's you know
[03:41.600 --> 03:45.360]  But it we're used to making things even even size widths
[03:46.000 --> 03:47.200]  Yeah
[03:47.200 --> 03:48.480]  well
[03:48.480 --> 03:50.080]  to me
[03:50.080 --> 03:52.080]  if this if this goes down like
[03:52.720 --> 03:56.240]  We think it's going to go down. It's really the end of thinking about
[03:56.780 --> 04:01.760]  Pixels. Yes, and that's really that's really the takeaway the
[04:01.760 --> 04:04.960]  the and you kind of see it in the the
[04:05.840 --> 04:08.800]  if you read between the lines, you always got to read between the lines between
[04:09.440 --> 04:14.720]  Um with wwc presentations, right because they're telling you stuff that's going to happen in the fall
[04:14.720 --> 04:16.720]  But they can't say it's going to happen in the fall
[04:17.280 --> 04:22.800]  Yeah, and it's all this thing about, you know compact versus regular, you know, uh
[04:22.800 --> 04:30.320]  Uh, what's the what's the it's uh, not traits. It's uh, let's get with it
[04:31.200 --> 04:37.040]  It's it's layouts. Yeah, the display class. Don't they call them layouts display class. Yes display class. That's what it is. Um,
[04:38.160 --> 04:41.760]  They're basically saying, you know, it's you know, sometimes you're going to display on a larger
[04:42.320 --> 04:44.560]  Screen, sometimes you're going to display on a more compact screen
[04:44.560 --> 04:52.080]  All right, and you're gonna you're gonna create layouts for those two different scenarios. Now, what are the number of points in those two? Well
[04:53.200 --> 05:00.720]  You've got the ipad and the iphone 5 right now as examples of the the the two cases, but
[05:02.000 --> 05:07.600]  But there there were there were a couple of sessions in wwc including the um
[05:07.600 --> 05:13.040]  Including the um, uh the state of the union
[05:13.680 --> 05:19.040]  As I like to call it the technical keynote, right, you know the the afternoon keynote on the good keynote
[05:19.760 --> 05:26.320]  Oh, I wouldn't say well, they're both good. They're both good. Yeah, but the but the one where we all like are going. Oh, yeah
[05:26.640 --> 05:28.000]  Oh, yeah
[05:28.000 --> 05:33.200]  It's like a meal in reverse is because we get our dessert in the morning and then we get the meat and
[05:33.200 --> 05:39.360]  Uh the nourishment in the afternoon, right? Exactly. That's a very that's a great analogy actually. Yeah
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  Uh, yeah, we're all still a little dizzy
[05:42.720 --> 05:47.520]  Right, exactly. We're right. We've got the sugar rush going and it's like now you're giving me a steak
[05:48.320 --> 05:52.960]  Right now all of a sudden there actually are putting code up on the screen and it's like wait a second
[05:53.040 --> 05:55.040]  I got it. I gotta slow down and think here
[05:55.280 --> 05:56.320]  um
[05:56.320 --> 06:00.640]  but even in the technical keynote even in the state of the union there was a little bit where they
[06:00.640 --> 06:06.960]  Immediately, it just was awkwardly phrased as to why in the world would they provide this for us unless there are
[06:07.680 --> 06:13.280]  New size devices coming out, but there's no way in hell they were going to say anything about new size devices
[06:13.600 --> 06:18.320]  But it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever that they would add this to the sdk otherwise
[06:19.120 --> 06:22.420]  And then in the session that i've been talking about this week session 216
[06:24.160 --> 06:29.280]  Adaptive layouts adaptive layouts in in apple's parlance is exactly well
[06:29.280 --> 06:34.800]  Maybe not exactly analogous, but it's the same basic idea as responsive web design, right?
[06:35.360 --> 06:37.280]  Right where you have one web page
[06:37.920 --> 06:41.360]  That scales and perhaps dramatic ways
[06:41.920 --> 06:46.640]  To look good on a phone on a tablet on a 30-inch display
[06:47.040 --> 06:52.160]  Like maybe when you know a lot of responsive websites when these show up on the phone
[06:52.160 --> 06:54.320]  They get rid of whole things they get rid of like
[06:54.320 --> 07:01.280]  Menus or all sorts of sidebars and stuff like that and just show the the text or they might move it to the bottom
[07:01.280 --> 07:07.280]  They might move like sidebar material to the bottom. Well, that's what adaptive layout and ios is like where you don't
[07:08.800 --> 07:10.160]  Effectively
[07:10.160 --> 07:17.360]  Redesign for this phone redesigned for this phone redesigned for the horizontal ipad redesigned for the vertical ipad. You just
[07:18.080 --> 07:22.960]  Set these constraints and say, you know in a dynamic fashion if it's between this and this
[07:22.960 --> 07:24.960]  between this and this
[07:25.280 --> 07:29.520]  Lay it out like this and if it gets smaller than this you can just hide this control
[07:29.920 --> 07:34.720]  yeah, and auto layout which is the technology that underlies all this is is
[07:35.280 --> 07:38.640]  Got a lot of parallels with css, which is yeah that underlies
[07:39.180 --> 07:41.360]  Responsive web design. Yeah. Yeah, it's
[07:42.160 --> 07:44.240]  I that was you know, that was the first thing I
[07:45.680 --> 07:51.680]  In learning about a lot of auto layout was like, okay. This is a lot like css. It's it's a very different take on
[07:51.680 --> 07:57.760]  The you know, the implementation is very different than than css, but it's solving the same problem
[07:58.480 --> 08:00.640]  Yeah for better. You don't know what size the screen is going to be
[08:01.280 --> 08:02.320]  Deal with it
[08:02.320 --> 08:07.280]  Right. It's a very apple-like thing to do to attack the same problem that css addresses
[08:07.840 --> 08:11.120]  And to just say we don't like effectively they're saying we don't like css
[08:11.120 --> 08:14.880]  We're going to you know, do it our own way and there's lots not to like about css
[08:14.880 --> 08:20.320]  I mean there's a reason why there are so many things like sass that are front ends to css
[08:20.320 --> 08:25.440]  Yeah, the css is a very general solution, right and this is a
[08:26.160 --> 08:33.680]  Pretty specific problem that that we're dealing with an ios right now so I can see why they did that right and the two
[08:34.480 --> 08:39.360]  The closest they came to to just come on, you know hitting us over the head with it
[08:39.360 --> 08:41.760]  Is that in the and I don't think this is
[08:42.400 --> 08:46.480]  Nda, I don't know. I'm never it's very unclear. What is nda or not anymore?
[08:46.480 --> 08:51.920]  But the the fact I mean, there's all sorts of places where you can also the video that talks about what you're about to talk about
[08:52.080 --> 08:58.160]  Is is not yeah, it's not nda. Yeah, and it's not you don't have to have an nda to to watch those videos anymore
[08:59.360 --> 09:04.560]  I assume you're you're talking about the fact that you can dial in the numbers that you want for the ios emulator
[09:04.560 --> 09:10.800]  Yeah, right when you do when you build and run your app in xcode you used to be able to choose between
[09:10.800 --> 09:17.200]  A device if you have like an actual physical ipad or iphone plugged in you can you know, you can pick it
[09:17.200 --> 09:23.680]  you know if your iphone is named craig's iphone you could say run this on craig's iphone and then the app would build for arm and
[09:24.560 --> 09:31.840]  Xcode would copy it over and it launches right on your actual iphone and if you run it in the simulator you'd have to pick between
[09:34.320 --> 09:35.280]  Actual
[09:35.280 --> 09:40.800]  Actual virtual ipads, you know ipad 2 ipad air ipad retina
[09:41.360 --> 09:44.160]  I find iphone 5 they added to this year
[09:44.880 --> 09:46.880]  resizable ipad
[09:46.880 --> 09:54.160]  And resizable iphone and at the bottom of those in the simulator you get to pick how many pixels wide the devices
[09:54.160 --> 10:01.120]  Right, right and how how high it is and like in the demo they picked I forget like 600 by 800 or something like that
[10:01.120 --> 10:03.120]  I don't know something that
[10:03.120 --> 10:08.800]  And it's you know, you'd sit there and watch this video and you're like why why why would they allow this?
[10:10.400 --> 10:14.160]  Yeah again, that's the reading between the lines right? It's like, okay
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.720]  There's going to be some display size that is not
[10:20.320 --> 10:23.360]  A multiple of 320 by 640 or right, you know
[10:24.080 --> 10:27.120]  325 what is it now 568?
[10:27.760 --> 10:30.160]  Yeah, I think of the number is yeah. Yeah
[10:30.160 --> 10:32.160]  so
[10:32.240 --> 10:35.760]  And you know to be honest, it doesn't really matter
[10:36.320 --> 10:41.440]  You know, it's like i'm the thing i'm coming to you know, the the conclusion i'm coming to is like, okay
[10:41.440 --> 10:43.760]  We're we've got to start thinking about this really
[10:44.400 --> 10:46.400]  in points
[10:46.400 --> 10:48.400]  it really is
[10:48.400 --> 10:54.960]  And that's that my only reservation here are those odd numbered points, right? It's like, you know, how do you split that in half?
[10:55.760 --> 10:57.760]  that's really the
[10:57.760 --> 10:59.760]  That's really the
[11:02.160 --> 11:04.160]  In fact, that's the I think
[11:04.960 --> 11:09.120]  You know people like paul haddad, you know, it was said, you know
[11:10.160 --> 11:14.880]  This is really a pain in the ass and paul haddad of uh tap bots. Yeah
[11:17.120 --> 11:18.160]  And
[11:18.160 --> 11:20.160]  You know, that's kind of where this this
[11:21.280 --> 11:24.160]  There was a conversation this weekend, and you know, it's like well, okay
[11:24.160 --> 11:28.960]  This and that's where I said, you know, this is the end of us, you know doing pixel perfect designs
[11:29.920 --> 11:31.040]  um
[11:31.040 --> 11:33.040]  and then your comment about the
[11:33.600 --> 11:35.600]  You know, how's this like?
[11:36.240 --> 11:40.080]  The retina macbook pro right, you know, you can set whatever
[11:41.280 --> 11:44.800]  Scaling factor you want right under behind the scenes
[11:45.920 --> 11:48.560]  The retina macbook pro always works at 2x
[11:48.560 --> 11:56.080]  It lays out a frame buffer at 2x, right? It renders your images at you know, two times their normal size
[11:56.160 --> 11:58.160]  but it may not display them at
[11:59.120 --> 12:01.120]  two times its size
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  It may display them at 1.6
[12:04.960 --> 12:06.880]  You know the size
[12:06.880 --> 12:12.560]  Well, there's five. I think there's five options if you have anybody who hasn't seen a retina macbook pro
[12:12.800 --> 12:16.960]  You're this might be very confusing and it was when I first heard about it
[12:16.960 --> 12:20.960]  Two years ago when the first retina max came out it sounded to me like
[12:21.440 --> 12:29.280]  wow, those other four settings are going to look awful and the gist of it is by default your retina macbook pro shows up
[12:29.840 --> 12:30.960]  with
[12:30.960 --> 12:35.600]  it there's five settings the one in the middle is like called best and
[12:36.160 --> 12:41.120]  It's the one where everything is rendered at exactly 2x because you have 2x
[12:41.280 --> 12:45.600]  You actually have 2x the pixels on the display and everything is rendered
[12:45.600 --> 12:48.800]  And everything is rendered at that size. It is pixel for drag
[12:49.760 --> 12:54.400]  And then there's two more size options in each direction bigger and smaller
[12:54.960 --> 13:03.040]  Where you go smaller everything on screen gets smaller and you effectively get a virtually bigger display where you have more
[13:04.320 --> 13:07.280]  And again, are they pixels are they points they're points
[13:07.280 --> 13:12.320]  I guess you'd call them more points in the display, right? And in other words like your eyes are great
[13:12.320 --> 13:18.080]  You have good eyes and you would like to see more content rendered smaller. You have two steps like
[13:18.960 --> 13:26.000]  Small and really small and then in the opposite direction, you can go big and really big and it zooms everything up a little bit
[13:26.640 --> 13:28.320]  um
[13:28.320 --> 13:29.840]  And I can see it a little bit
[13:29.840 --> 13:32.480]  Especially if I take my glasses off and get real close to the screen
[13:32.720 --> 13:38.640]  But at typical viewing distance from a matte retina macbook pro. I actually don't see it. It actually
[13:38.640 --> 13:42.960]  It turns out it works really well. Yeah, our eyes are old enough that it's like
[13:43.600 --> 13:44.640]  Okay
[13:44.640 --> 13:49.920]  Yeah, I close enough, you know, I was talking with molt about that a couple of weeks ago on the show about my eyes
[13:49.920 --> 13:51.920]  I'm you know at
[13:52.080 --> 13:56.560]  41 or whatever the hell I am. I'm so i'm i'm hitting that hitting those those limits, but
[13:58.800 --> 14:04.080]  I don't know. I actually think because when I take my glasses off and get real close to something I can still see I
[14:04.160 --> 14:06.080]  You know if I get it close enough to my eyes
[14:06.080 --> 14:10.560]  I can see it pretty sharp and i've i've gotten really close to a retina macbook pro and it's pretty effective
[14:11.520 --> 14:14.000]  Yeah, well i've been working on uh
[14:15.280 --> 14:22.640]  Some stuff for usimity and and doing retina versions off and I don't have a a macbook pro with
[14:22.720 --> 14:26.560]  A retina display, but I do have a 30 inch cinema display
[14:27.440 --> 14:29.200]  That I can put
[14:29.200 --> 14:33.120]  Into a retina mode with some developer tools. So instead of having 25
[14:33.120 --> 14:40.080]  Having 25 60 by 1500 pixels, I think it is, you know, I basically get half that number
[14:41.200 --> 14:42.560]  so I get
[14:42.560 --> 14:44.240]  a
[14:44.240 --> 14:46.240]  It renders in retina on
[14:46.320 --> 14:53.120]  The 30 inch display. So basically i've got like a 15 inch display in 30 inches of physical space and it's huge
[14:53.520 --> 14:55.520]  But it's really readable
[14:56.480 --> 15:01.360]  I don't have any problems seeing it and I can look at you know individual pixels. It's really good for testing
[15:01.360 --> 15:06.320]  But you know, that's that's an extreme case, you know, if somebody had a a vision problem
[15:07.680 --> 15:09.680]  You know that
[15:09.680 --> 15:12.400]  30 inches of real estate displaying a 15 inch image
[15:12.960 --> 15:20.080]  Would be awesome. Yeah, but and with you know, text rendered as well as it could be at the actual size that it's at
[15:20.080 --> 15:22.320]  You don't have you know big there's no big
[15:22.960 --> 15:26.720]  jaggies all over the place it doesn't look anything like
[15:27.280 --> 15:28.400]  when
[15:28.400 --> 15:35.920]  When non-updated iphone apps were running on the original iphone 4 right, you know, everybody remembers that they look terrible
[15:36.160 --> 15:39.840]  Everybody I mean you you'd have to be you know, maybe like borderline
[15:40.400 --> 15:44.640]  Legally, you know blind not to be able to notice. Wow that this looks pretty
[15:45.440 --> 15:46.880]  fuzzy
[15:46.880 --> 15:50.160]  It's not like that at all. Yeah, like once the pixels get small enough
[15:50.240 --> 15:53.040]  You can start playing games like that and I do think that's what it is
[15:53.040 --> 15:59.280]  So it's you know, if if this number i've come up with that i've heard I haven't didn't just pull it out of thin air
[15:59.280 --> 16:01.760]  But I did, you know, I can't can't say bet on it
[16:01.760 --> 16:08.800]  But if it's 1334 by 750 and these point sizes are odd. What's what's weird about it is that there's a
[16:10.000 --> 16:11.520]  to our
[16:11.520 --> 16:12.880]  user interface
[16:12.880 --> 16:15.200]  slash programmer minds a much more
[16:15.760 --> 16:20.080]  Obvious number right next door just add two pixels in each dimension
[16:20.960 --> 16:22.000]  and
[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  One of them is divisible by 16
[16:24.720 --> 16:26.220]  uh
[16:26.220 --> 16:28.220]  336 1336
[16:28.480 --> 16:30.640]  Just add two pixels is divisible by eight
[16:31.180 --> 16:32.480]  evenly
[16:32.480 --> 16:36.000]  And 752 is divisible not just by eight but by 16
[16:36.560 --> 16:38.640]  Which is what?
[16:38.640 --> 16:42.080]  Divisibility by 16 is what a lot of people just expect in a display
[16:43.120 --> 16:45.120]  um
[16:45.600 --> 16:49.520]  And it's only two pixels which is at
[16:49.520 --> 16:51.100]  At
[16:51.100 --> 16:53.940]  326 pixels per inch, uh one
[16:55.700 --> 16:57.680]  One over
[16:57.680 --> 16:59.300]  163
[16:59.300 --> 17:05.220]  Of an inch so it's not it's still a 4.7 inch display. It's literally one
[17:05.700 --> 17:10.180]  Less than one hundredth of an inch difference in physical size. So why wouldn't they do that?
[17:11.380 --> 17:18.900]  I don't know. I have no idea but the the the the little whispers word on the street are 1334 by 750
[17:18.900 --> 17:20.980]  I don't know. Maybe that's just an estimate
[17:20.980 --> 17:26.180]  Maybe it's wrong and then you know phil schiller's up on stage and the tech specs come up and it says 1336 by
[17:26.400 --> 17:28.820]  752 I don't know and you know that was close enough to
[17:28.980 --> 17:33.780]  750 where the word that came out and was whispered around was was off by a little they don't know
[17:33.860 --> 17:37.140]  They don't talk about pixels and in tech specs typically
[17:37.540 --> 17:42.900]  No, they do they give you the exact pixel dispense dimensions in tech specs. They don't talk about ram
[17:42.980 --> 17:46.580]  They never tell you the ram and they don't tell you clock speeds on
[17:46.580 --> 17:50.200]  Processors, I don't think but they definitely don't tell you about ram
[17:50.200 --> 17:53.720]  But they do tell you if you look at the tech specs now, they tell you that okay
[17:54.440 --> 17:56.440]  I seem to remember having a problem
[17:56.520 --> 18:02.920]  figuring out what the actual dimensions were for an iphone 5 screen at one point, but you know, I think they do it because they
[18:03.320 --> 18:07.080]  Dumb, I I think they do it because they want to brag about the pixels per inch
[18:08.040 --> 18:11.560]  And they do tell you the diagonal and so they give you know
[18:11.800 --> 18:15.240]  You can just divide right there and you can you know, it gives it away, right?
[18:15.240 --> 18:17.240]  that
[18:17.800 --> 18:19.800]  The diagonal size is actually
[18:19.960 --> 18:21.960]  an interesting thing to do in fact what
[18:22.600 --> 18:27.080]  my wife and I were talking about what we were going to talk about on this podcast while we're having dinner and
[18:27.720 --> 18:29.240]  um
[18:29.240 --> 18:35.720]  She's like what is a 4.7 inch display and what's a 5.5 inch display like and it there's a real simple thing
[18:35.800 --> 18:39.320]  You can do you get out a ruler that's got 5.5 inches on it
[18:40.120 --> 18:42.680]  and put it diagonally across your screen and
[18:42.680 --> 18:49.000]  You know go out to 5.5 because the aspect ratio is going to stay the same right as your is your iphone 5
[18:49.000 --> 18:50.680]  That's not going to change
[18:50.680 --> 18:52.680]  so you can just draw
[18:53.240 --> 18:57.240]  a line out to 5.5 and and get an idea for how big that screen is and it's
[18:58.520 --> 19:00.200]  it's hefty
[19:00.200 --> 19:02.200]  right and then and
[19:02.280 --> 19:05.640]  this is more fuel for the you know, is the
[19:07.060 --> 19:09.060]  5.5 inch display
[19:09.060 --> 19:12.580]  Going to behave like an ipad or is it going to behave like an iphone?
[19:13.460 --> 19:15.540]  Well, let's hold that thought and let me do
[19:16.180 --> 19:18.100]  Take a break and do our first sponsor. Uh
[19:19.140 --> 19:21.140]  brand new sponsor
[19:21.540 --> 19:24.820]  Really really interesting. I can't I almost can't believe it. It's like in terms of
[19:25.460 --> 19:30.660]  Things I expected to be sponsoring my my my show, but here it is. It's casper
[19:32.340 --> 19:34.340]  Sleep caspersleep.com
[19:34.340 --> 19:41.700]  They are brand new. They're they're they're like a warby parker to glasses like a uh, like harry's to shaving except it's to
[19:42.340 --> 19:44.340]  premium mattresses
[19:44.820 --> 19:46.820]  Mattresses the things that you sleep on
[19:47.620 --> 19:49.460]  I swear to god, here's the thing though
[19:50.020 --> 19:55.140]  As part of the sponsorship they they sent me one a demo they sent me a quiz. They sent you a mattress
[19:55.780 --> 20:01.380]  Honest to god i'll get back to this craig i'll get back to this because you think that's crazy. Yeah. Yeah, it is crazy
[20:01.380 --> 20:04.420]  I was like, how the hell are they going to send me a mattress? Well, here's the deal
[20:04.980 --> 20:06.020]  It's a new
[20:06.020 --> 20:09.220]  High, it's like a new I don't know they've got like some kind of new high-tech stuff
[20:09.220 --> 20:14.100]  They call it a new hybrid mattress that combines premium latex foam with memory foam
[20:14.820 --> 20:20.420]  It's a combination but it's not like memory foam. It's not that thing where you you get stuck in the bed
[20:20.420 --> 20:24.500]  Yeah, like I wake up in the morning and there's like a crime scene body thing. No, it's not like that at all
[20:24.740 --> 20:30.020]  It's just honest to god. It just feels like a great mattress. It just is it's it's just like a nice combination
[20:30.020 --> 20:37.540]  It's just like a nice combination of uh, you know softness and and a little bit of that sort of does amy like it
[20:38.420 --> 20:40.420]  Yeah, yeah, it's great mattress. Um
[20:41.780 --> 20:47.940]  And it's exactly the same sort of thing as like eyeglasses were where the mattress industry is just crooked as all hell
[20:48.500 --> 20:53.780]  uh, and they pay notoriously high markups and the existing mattress companies like
[20:54.260 --> 20:56.820]  Last time it has been a long time since I went mattress shopping
[20:56.820 --> 21:00.900]  but I remember you know, I remember reading a thing on cocky about it where you go from one store to another
[21:01.300 --> 21:04.740]  And you look at like you take one of the big name brands like celia or whatever
[21:04.980 --> 21:07.060]  And you go into the one store and you write down
[21:07.220 --> 21:11.460]  The ones that they had that you thought you liked and you go to another store and they don't have those models
[21:11.540 --> 21:18.040]  They sell like different models to every store with different names so that you can't compare like they've they've conspired
[21:18.880 --> 21:26.100]  Successfully to avoid, you know, yeah allowing you to be informed try to price match. Yeah. Yeah, you can't casper
[21:26.100 --> 21:28.520]  Casper undercuts among price dramatically
[21:29.560 --> 21:36.120]  Here's their prices. They're they're not even afraid to tell you what they are. Most mattresses good mattresses cost start at over 1500 bucks
[21:36.760 --> 21:43.960]  Casper's cost between 500 that's where a twin size mattress fits. That's that's like what craig would like keep his arm on. Yeah
[21:44.680 --> 21:52.680]  600 for xl twin 750 for full size mattress 850 for a queen and only 950 bucks for a king size mattress
[21:53.880 --> 21:55.160]  great prices
[21:55.160 --> 22:00.760]  There's not a lot of complication between what type of mattress they just make one type of mattress that just feels great
[22:00.760 --> 22:03.960]  You don't have to get all complicated about it's just a nice soft mattress
[22:04.600 --> 22:08.600]  They do this crazy thing when they ship it you think well how the hell they're going to ship a mattress
[22:09.000 --> 22:12.200]  They I don't know what the hell they do, but it's like vacuum packed
[22:12.360 --> 22:18.920]  It's still a big box, but it's like a big box that like maybe looks like it has like a dorm room fridge in it
[22:18.920 --> 22:25.880]  It it it doesn't ship as like a big as like a full-size mattress shows up at your house in this thing that you know
[22:26.040 --> 22:32.040]  Actually, you're like a UPS guy could reasonably give you it's actually kind of it's actually one of the coolest things you open
[22:32.040 --> 22:35.080]  I I was just gonna say do you have to kind of like stand back when you open?
[22:39.720 --> 22:46.560]  Obsessively engineered mattresses at shockingly fair prices a kiss can't let it it's got the right sink just the right bounce
[22:46.560 --> 22:53.440]  It is kind of bouncy two technologies latex foam and memory foam that come together for better nights better days
[22:53.960 --> 22:58.560]  Risk-free trial because this again anytime the first time you buy X on the internet
[22:58.560 --> 23:01.660]  You think like this is crazy that I'm buying a mattress on the internet
[23:02.320 --> 23:08.360]  Risk-free trial and return you get to try sleeping on it for a hundred days free delivery
[23:09.040 --> 23:12.960]  Painless return if you don't actually like it their mattresses are made in America
[23:12.960 --> 23:18.280]  Prices are great. So here's what you do. Oh and Evan done another deal. They've got this
[23:19.600 --> 23:21.600]  referral program
[23:21.920 --> 23:27.380]  So you get it one of these mattresses every friend you refer to Casper gives you a $50 gift card
[23:27.840 --> 23:31.440]  Plus any friend you refer also gets 50 bucks toward their mattress
[23:32.660 --> 23:39.200]  So they've offered us for the show the same opportunity. So you save use this code. It's it's I'll give you the URL
[23:39.200 --> 23:44.880]  www Casper CAS per Casper sleep calm
[23:45.760 --> 23:47.000]  talk show
[23:47.000 --> 23:53.820]  Slash talk show and I think when you check out you might have to use the promo code talk show know the just talk show
[23:54.120 --> 23:56.280]  you'll save 50 bucks I
[23:57.440 --> 24:02.320]  Get $50 referral fee, but my $50 for free. I'm not getting I don't want I don't want that
[24:02.320 --> 24:06.980]  They've already paid for the sponsorship. So we're gonna give it all the charity. We're gonna give it to the
[24:06.980 --> 24:08.940]  the
[24:08.940 --> 24:13.620]  Food and allergy anaphylactic network thing that my wife and son
[24:14.980 --> 24:19.020]  Participate in every year. So you save 50 bucks using the code on a mattress
[24:19.480 --> 24:24.860]  50 bucks goes to great charity and it's it's serious. I just can't believe it here
[24:24.860 --> 24:27.140]  I am selling mattresses, but it really is worth your attention
[24:28.460 --> 24:35.020]  You'll save money and you get a great mattress. I think the last time you had me on you were selling Caesar salads
[24:35.020 --> 24:38.500]  Yeah, I wasn't that great that was awesome
[24:38.500 --> 24:44.100]  You know, so it's kind of like an honor that I get all the weird but kind of cool
[24:44.100 --> 24:50.060]  I I'm tired of it. I think that the I think all sponsors I think you know, the show's doing pretty good
[24:50.060 --> 24:52.460]  It's I have a lot of repeat sponsors. I'm really happy about that
[24:53.380 --> 24:56.900]  And you know to me that's proof that it must be some kind of decent value
[24:57.100 --> 25:01.860]  But I love the sponsors that you don't think of is like oh, it's a tech podcast
[25:01.860 --> 25:09.380]  You know, let's sponsor it, you know, the the ones like the salad and eyeglasses and now mattresses, but I think it's great
[25:09.380 --> 25:14.060]  I don't know. I think that the core audience at during fireball isn't really defined by technology
[25:14.060 --> 25:19.600]  I think it's people who like nice things and are willing to pay for them. Yeah, that's well
[25:19.600 --> 25:21.980]  That's kind of just sums up the Apple
[25:23.220 --> 25:25.220]  customer base to and you know
[25:25.740 --> 25:30.540]  Frustrated by bullshit and stuff like that and buying a mattress is so so much bullshit. I don't know
[25:30.540 --> 25:33.460]  I think that this guy I don't know how many people buy a mattress per week
[25:33.460 --> 25:38.980]  But I'll bet I I have this have a gut feeling that they they could do really well. Yeah. No it is
[25:39.580 --> 25:41.580]  It's it's one of those sleazy
[25:42.300 --> 25:46.740]  You just it just it just oozes, you know, oh my god. What am I doing here?
[25:46.740 --> 25:51.980]  It's like a cartel because there's only like a couple of companies that control the whole industry and they just sort of conspire to
[25:52.380 --> 25:57.160]  Lock it. All right. So anyway, my thanks to them Casper sleep comm slash
[25:57.160 --> 26:02.400]  Talk show. All right, like you were saying this is a great great question and that
[26:02.840 --> 26:04.360]  WWDC session
[26:04.360 --> 26:06.360]  raises points about it is is
[26:07.120 --> 26:13.060]  This especially the five point five one is this five if it you know, and if it ships this year I do
[26:13.280 --> 26:17.840]  I'm almost I would say I'm 99% sure there's a five point five inch iPhone coming
[26:17.840 --> 26:23.000]  Is it coming September 9th that I don't know, you know could be something, you know, who knows?
[26:23.000 --> 26:27.360]  Maybe there'll be a special event in February or something, but I I do think it's coming
[26:28.080 --> 26:33.880]  And when it does is it going to act like an iPhone layout wise or more like an iPad?
[26:33.880 --> 26:38.360]  and so for example in that session 216 they set up the
[26:40.360 --> 26:42.200]  Adaptive layout
[26:42.200 --> 26:46.720]  Constraints such that when you rotate the phone to landscape
[26:47.320 --> 26:50.680]  that it works like an iPad and so if you have
[26:50.680 --> 26:56.680]  It was like a list of messages and you tap it it showed it, you know
[26:56.680 --> 27:02.400]  It was like one-third of the screen was for the list and the other two-thirds shows what you have selected
[27:02.560 --> 27:07.280]  Right and it stays on screen as opposed to the entire, you know to navigation
[27:09.260 --> 27:15.880]  To view controllers on screen at once as opposed to the iPhone where it's always only one at a time it really is
[27:17.040 --> 27:19.040]  from somebody who's who's
[27:19.040 --> 27:22.040]  Has 54 year old eyes, right? I
[27:23.400 --> 27:25.400]  Don't necessarily want a
[27:26.600 --> 27:29.920]  Smaller version of the iPad. I want a larger version of the iPhone
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  right somebody something that can
[27:34.240 --> 27:35.800]  Give you know
[27:35.800 --> 27:37.800]  Give me more space
[27:37.920 --> 27:39.920]  bigger text
[27:39.920 --> 27:43.380]  To you know read the stuff that I'm having trouble, you know, to be honest
[27:43.380 --> 27:45.380]  There's some stuff on the iPhone that I have trouble reading
[27:45.380 --> 27:48.580]  All right, it's just it just gets too small
[27:52.980 --> 27:58.760]  The flip side of that, you know somebody who's you know in their 20s, you know, they spend it a lot of time
[27:59.740 --> 28:01.740]  Looking at YouTube videos
[28:02.100 --> 28:08.980]  You know, they've got Facebook's there all their social networks, right? You know, they do all sorts of stuff on their phone
[28:08.980 --> 28:10.980]  They got great eyes
[28:11.360 --> 28:13.360]  They're gonna want that phone
[28:13.360 --> 28:15.320]  to work
[28:15.320 --> 28:21.560]  More like an iPad right? Just yeah tiny little font those shitloads of content on the screen
[28:22.560 --> 28:24.560]  so I
[28:24.840 --> 28:28.680]  That's why I say, you know pixels don't really matter anymore, right? It's like
[28:29.480 --> 28:34.920]  this is I see Apple telling us, you know, give up that the idea of
[28:36.800 --> 28:40.000]  Of pixels and start thinking about
[28:40.000 --> 28:47.120]  Areas, right? Yeah in fact and and trust that everything's gonna look sharp. Yeah, it's it's interesting
[28:47.120 --> 28:52.560]  One of the first things I did when I got an iPhone right is it's like I want to understand what that that magic
[28:52.640 --> 28:54.640]  44 pixel number was all about
[28:55.240 --> 28:56.240]  and
[28:56.240 --> 29:00.640]  I actually got a ruler out and put my finger against that ruler and
[29:01.980 --> 29:05.640]  My fingertip covered about a quarter of an inch. Well if you
[29:05.640 --> 29:11.840]  Know if you take the 44 pics, you know, 44 pixels divided by what?
[29:11.840 --> 29:15.440]  What was it 163 was the DPI originally?
[29:16.120 --> 29:21.600]  162 or 160. Yeah, I think they call it 163 now. It works out to be about a quarter of an inch
[29:21.720 --> 29:25.520]  Yeah, it's a little bit bigger a little tiny little bit bigger than the quarter of inch
[29:25.520 --> 29:31.900]  But you know, that's the size of your fingertip. Yeah, right and you know as we go to these different size displays
[29:31.900 --> 29:33.900]  The
[29:34.220 --> 29:36.220]  Number of pixels have changed but
[29:36.500 --> 29:42.500]  Our fingertips haven't changed. All right, we still you know, I still touch a piece of glass and it's about a quarter of an inch
[29:42.500 --> 29:44.260]  so it's
[29:44.260 --> 29:46.260]  Let's keep the controls that size
[29:46.380 --> 29:52.660]  yeah, something has to I don't know maybe I wasn't clear enough in the piece that I wrote over the weekend, but
[29:53.380 --> 29:58.780]  Something has to stay the same and in in I think what's been confusing and even to me
[29:58.780 --> 30:03.860]  It's caught me off guard for the first couple of years. A lot of things stayed the same as
[30:04.380 --> 30:06.380]  New iOS devices came out
[30:06.580 --> 30:12.540]  It wasn't just one or two factors that stayed the same lot stayed the same and when they first went retina
[30:12.540 --> 30:17.440]  It went they increased the resolution in such an easy to understand way
[30:17.660 --> 30:24.180]  The screen size was exactly the same. They just put four pixels into every spot where previously there'd only been one
[30:24.180 --> 30:31.620]  and it made us I think it fooled me definitely and I still has given the people who are
[30:31.820 --> 30:33.820]  Who seem to be doubting my predictions?
[30:34.100 --> 30:37.460]  There's still a lot of people out there who think they're gonna stay and keep it that way
[30:37.460 --> 30:45.100]  You know that the only reasonable way to go up they think is 1704 by 960, which is exactly three times the pixels
[30:45.100 --> 30:47.100]  but if they did that and
[30:47.940 --> 30:51.620]  Increase the size of the phone to four point seven and five point five
[30:51.620 --> 30:58.600]  They would be changing the size of the points. Mm-hmm, right and they would be changing the size of
[30:59.320 --> 31:01.320]  those tap targets and
[31:01.960 --> 31:06.040]  That I don't think they're gonna do that. I think that that is not gonna happen, right?
[31:06.040 --> 31:10.400]  Well, and it could I think they could make them a little bigger I do and I think on the 5.5
[31:10.400 --> 31:12.280]  They are going to make a little bigger
[31:12.280 --> 31:17.960]  But I think that to make it so that you get more content on the screen at once at a reasonable size
[31:17.960 --> 31:25.080]  The point is the thing that they're going to more or less keep centered. So if you have a 44 by 44
[31:25.840 --> 31:27.840]  tap target like for a
[31:29.520 --> 31:32.520]  And a tab controller at the bottom of the screen to switch between
[31:33.120 --> 31:38.380]  You know your mentions or your you know, your main timeline and a Twitter client or something like that
[31:39.120 --> 31:44.840]  That 44 by 44 point target is gonna be roughly the same size on all devices
[31:44.840 --> 31:49.600]  no matter which, you know from from for it for inch iPhones to
[31:50.380 --> 31:53.460]  You know nine point seven inch iPads or you know
[31:54.120 --> 31:59.440]  Perhaps a 12 inch iPad, but that 44 by 44 point target is going to be mostly the same
[32:00.040 --> 32:06.200]  And some of those devices are going to have four hundred and sixty pixels per inch some three hundred twenty six pixels per inch
[32:06.520 --> 32:13.040]  There's old ones, you know, there's still a lot of iPad first generation iPad minis out there with a hundred and sixty three per inch
[32:13.040 --> 32:18.720]  Mm-hmm, but the point is more or less the same size and that 44 by 44 tap target button is
[32:19.360 --> 32:23.520]  Something you can count on as a designer and and when you start messing with that
[32:23.520 --> 32:27.720]  I mean everybody's come across a web page where the links on that page, you know
[32:27.720 --> 32:30.220]  They don't have a responsive design on the web page
[32:30.880 --> 32:37.920]  Right. So like, you know the the next button on that web page is this tiny little target and you know
[32:37.920 --> 32:42.520]  You try to get your finger to get right over that and you like you hit the you know
[32:42.520 --> 32:46.640]  Some other link or some other control or they put and it's so frustrating
[32:47.200 --> 32:53.040]  Right, or it's not just that it's not just that they're small but that there's they're small and there's two right next to exactly
[32:53.040 --> 32:54.520]  It's like a paging control, right?
[32:54.520 --> 32:58.360]  You know you're trying to you want to go to page two and it's like you hit page three and it's like ah
[32:58.840 --> 32:59.960]  Yeah
[32:59.960 --> 33:01.880]  Then you swear at the web designer
[33:01.880 --> 33:07.680]  Well, you know if they start screwing her off the size of those tap targets, we're gonna be swearing at it at every
[33:07.680 --> 33:14.500]  IOS developer in every, you know Apple developers. It's just gonna be that they're not gonna screw with that
[33:15.380 --> 33:17.660]  It'll be it may be you know
[33:18.540 --> 33:26.060]  slightly different like you're saying, you know, maybe you know five percent different plus or minus but it's not gonna change significantly
[33:26.880 --> 33:28.880]  ever since
[33:29.580 --> 33:31.300]  There were first
[33:31.300 --> 33:38.260]  Rumors even just vague ones that that there would be future iPhones with significantly bigger screens not just the 4.0
[33:38.260 --> 33:42.620]  But stay with the same aspect rich because that wasn't really a change in size when they went to four
[33:42.620 --> 33:49.140]  It was more about changing the aspect ratio because they kept the width exactly the same six hundred three hundred and twenty points
[33:49.740 --> 33:54.660]  640 pixels they just added pixels in one dimension to change the aspect ratio
[33:54.660 --> 34:02.620]  Ever since there's been talk of a bigger iPhone. I've always just started with the question of well
[34:02.620 --> 34:08.520]  What's the problem they're trying to solve? Is it showing more content like more text per page?
[34:09.820 --> 34:15.500]  Or is it about zooming it up and making the text that is on the page bigger?
[34:16.440 --> 34:19.400]  You know and and there's different, you know, too totally, you know
[34:19.400 --> 34:25.100]  and it is largely age-based two totally different reasons to go each way where if you're younger and
[34:25.260 --> 34:30.700]  You want to use your phone as more of your personal more and more like it's your main personal computer
[34:31.040 --> 34:33.940]  You want more you want you want to show more at once?
[34:34.540 --> 34:36.540]  And if you're older
[34:37.460 --> 34:39.920]  You want bigger text, right?
[34:39.920 --> 34:46.920]  and so you can see it I think that by putting a lot more pixels on the screen going to 3x and
[34:46.920 --> 34:48.920]  having something like
[34:52.280 --> 34:55.020]  2208 by 1242, which is my guess
[34:57.760 --> 35:05.280]  That by default it's going to be mostly about showing more content because that's a 68% increase in the area
[35:05.700 --> 35:12.680]  You know multiply the number of visible visible points on screen not pixels, but points by one point six eight and you that's a lot more
[35:12.680 --> 35:18.760]  And it's a scaling factor of six percent. So it's a little you know about five or six percent bigger
[35:19.160 --> 35:22.440]  But I think that what they'll be able to do to make other you know
[35:22.440 --> 35:26.520]  The people who want everything just want big text happy is I think that they I don't know
[35:26.520 --> 35:32.640]  I mean, there's nothing certainly nothing like this in the iOS 8 betas, but and maybe it won't even be an iOS 8
[35:32.640 --> 35:39.440]  Maybe we'll have to wait for iOS 9 or something, but they could add something like the retina MacBook Pro scaling factor
[35:39.440 --> 35:46.400]  and where you you treat the 5.5 inch phone as a 2x device instead of a 3x device and
[35:46.920 --> 35:52.600]  all of the apps already have a 2x layout and it just scales up and
[35:54.000 --> 35:57.800]  Well, it's even simpler than that, right? It's like there there is that
[35:58.640 --> 36:05.320]  regular size or compact size that they talk about in session 216 and
[36:06.680 --> 36:08.680]  You know you
[36:08.680 --> 36:11.040]  You can say okay. I want my
[36:11.800 --> 36:15.780]  5.5 inch iPhone to act like it's compact or
[36:16.680 --> 36:20.160]  oh, no, no, no, I want it to act more like regular and
[36:21.920 --> 36:23.920]  The code that's written
[36:24.320 --> 36:27.920]  Well for the new, you know size classes
[36:27.920 --> 36:38.080]  Works correctly, right you get oh all of a sudden this behaves like an iPad or oh all sudden this behaves like an iPhone
[36:39.080 --> 36:40.720]  Given that
[36:40.720 --> 36:48.800]  display size that the physical display size that you're working with. Yeah, so I I think it's it's
[36:49.320 --> 36:51.320]  You're right. It's it
[36:51.440 --> 36:55.800]  there are two sets of people and they it's all about content and
[36:55.800 --> 36:57.800]  Some of them want more
[36:58.360 --> 37:04.520]  Some of them want bigger and some of them want some kind of mix between the two. Yeah, I mean, you know and and I
[37:05.400 --> 37:08.920]  Think Apple did a brilliant thing with that retina MacBook Pro, right?
[37:08.920 --> 37:16.720]  Cuz it yeah handles a lot of different situations from the software developers point of view. It's pretty simple, right? You just you
[37:17.320 --> 37:23.840]  You're rendering into a frame buffer. That's you know, twice as big as it used to be and
[37:23.840 --> 37:25.640]  And
[37:25.640 --> 37:30.940]  Those pixels make it to the screen. However, they make them their way to the screen. Yeah
[37:32.640 --> 37:38.920]  Another thing that's interesting in that I've discovered recently in the the Xcode beta
[37:39.720 --> 37:41.720]  is
[37:41.840 --> 37:43.840]  The ability to specify
[37:44.720 --> 37:46.280]  images
[37:46.280 --> 37:48.640]  specifically, you know graphics and software as
[37:49.480 --> 37:50.760]  vectors
[37:50.760 --> 37:54.140]  There's the ability to specify your
[37:55.360 --> 37:57.360]  image as a
[37:57.880 --> 37:59.880]  Say for example a PDF file
[38:02.760 --> 38:06.480]  What's interesting there is that that's always been problematic in the past
[38:08.680 --> 38:14.840]  Because you you know you take a you know saying the iOS 6 world right you take a richly rendered
[38:14.840 --> 38:22.040]  button with gradients and all sorts of you know, nice shadows and things like that and
[38:22.920 --> 38:27.440]  You take the PDF for that and it's number one. It's a pretty complex
[38:28.320 --> 38:33.840]  PDF file right it contains gradients and shadows and all sorts of stuff and
[38:34.480 --> 38:39.640]  Then you scale it down to any kind of size and it just it never looks great
[38:40.160 --> 38:42.960]  Right unless it's really big then it looks awesome
[38:42.960 --> 38:50.400]  But now with iOS 7, you know since i07 it all of the graphics in our applications
[38:50.920 --> 38:53.640]  Are really just you know stroke lines
[38:54.760 --> 38:58.720]  Right. They're really simple right an arrow is just you know, two lines
[38:59.320 --> 39:02.880]  It you know a 90 degree angle, you know
[39:03.760 --> 39:07.640]  Rotated 45 degrees, right? It's it's you know, and it literally is that
[39:07.640 --> 39:13.920]  That's how it's described in the PDF file, right? You know, this line is so many points long, right?
[39:13.920 --> 39:17.240]  You know, it goes from this point to this point this point to this point done
[39:17.520 --> 39:23.800]  Yeah, and that reminds me that's an exit various two point Craig and it brings me back to something that I remember now
[39:25.280 --> 39:27.280]  Well, I suspected it might have
[39:27.760 --> 39:34.440]  That I might it's something to file away and remember but last year in June when I first saw iOS 7
[39:34.440 --> 39:38.240]  When it was, you know, here's here's the big reveal. I
[39:38.880 --> 39:43.160]  Was talking to somebody at Apple can't say who but you know, but what I was told was
[39:43.840 --> 39:48.920]  From someone who had a hand in the design and it was something to the effect of well
[39:48.920 --> 39:55.920]  We know some of the stuff that's coming and that informed some of our decisions. Yeah, you know, and I can't tell you about it now
[39:56.640 --> 39:57.880]  but
[39:57.880 --> 40:02.420]  You know that played that you know part of this is not just about what it looks like now
[40:02.420 --> 40:05.160]  Which we think looks great and we really are we really are proud of it
[40:05.240 --> 40:07.040]  but part of it is about
[40:07.040 --> 40:13.360]  What's coming in the future and I do think that that's part of it that this is clearly it's the iOS 7 style is clearly
[40:13.360 --> 40:14.480]  more scalable
[40:14.480 --> 40:21.360]  Yeah, it malleable. It's that whole resolution independence thing is well that was an Apple's really wanted
[40:21.360 --> 40:27.480]  Yeah, that's the old term but it really is that god that go back to like Mac OS 10.4 10.5
[40:27.480 --> 40:33.360]  It was already and it was always problematic because you know, it's like aqua was not an easy thing to scale
[40:34.640 --> 40:40.320]  resolution wise yeah, I did had all sorts of gradients and shadows and all this and now that we're
[40:40.960 --> 40:45.400]  In Yosemite land and I was seven land. It's a
[40:45.960 --> 40:48.400]  Lot easier. Yeah the old time
[40:49.200 --> 40:51.200]  the original era was
[40:51.200 --> 40:59.920]  Everybody knew that ultimately it was about higher resolution displays and getting more pixels prints on our displays
[41:00.200 --> 41:02.980]  But we didn't we didn't have this retina
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  terminology and
[41:06.600 --> 41:11.480]  It's not so much that retina is a magic word, you know, it's it's an arbitrary
[41:12.200 --> 41:17.520]  Marketing term and there's a basic the basic idea that at the distance at which you know
[41:17.520 --> 41:24.040]  The pixel isn't discernible from your eye as long as it's you know, a typical viewing distance then that counts as retina
[41:24.040 --> 41:26.960]  There there's definitely some scientific merit to that
[41:29.040 --> 41:32.680]  But what wound up happening though is that it's sort of a binary
[41:34.080 --> 41:39.720]  thing does an Apple display whether it's a Mac or an iOS device is either retina or not and
[41:41.120 --> 41:44.800]  For those of us who care about the details we can tell yeah, this one's retina
[41:44.800 --> 41:49.160]  This one's not like the first time you saw a retina iPhone. It was double. Yeah
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.200]  Yeah, even with the MacBook Pros though
[41:52.200 --> 41:59.320]  The first one was the 15 inch right the 15 inch MacBook Pro shipped first and it was like it wasn't quite double the pixels
[41:59.320 --> 42:05.200]  You know, I think you could fake it with that scaling factor that we had to make it double the you know resolution
[42:05.440 --> 42:11.520]  But the actual at the native resolution everything was a little bit bigger because it wasn't they didn't quite get to double the pixels
[42:11.520 --> 42:15.920]  But you could just tell as soon as you looked at it. You're like, wow, this is something unlike anything
[42:15.920 --> 42:20.140]  I've ever seen on a Mac before at this level like the fonts look like real fonts
[42:20.760 --> 42:22.080]  I
[42:22.080 --> 42:25.440]  Think back in the original era and it wasn't just us on the outside
[42:25.440 --> 42:31.280]  I think even Apple had this that it was never it wasn't quite that did they didn't foresee doing it as like this binary
[42:31.760 --> 42:35.440]  Switch it was going to be this continuum where every maybe every couple years
[42:35.440 --> 42:42.120]  We'd get a couple more pixels per inch and that if we had retina or not retina resolution independent assets
[42:42.400 --> 42:44.520]  We wouldn't have to keep redrawing everything
[42:45.080 --> 42:50.480]  But it didn't work out that way. It was never really. Yeah, I never really shipped a version of Mac OS X
[42:50.480 --> 42:56.280]  That was resolution independent. It was a chicken. It was a chicken and egg problem, right? It's like developers aren't gonna do
[42:57.060 --> 43:01.680]  resolution independent graphics until they've got a resolution independent screen and Apple's not gonna release a
[43:01.680 --> 43:05.800]  resolution in the screen until their apps that run resolution independently
[43:06.200 --> 43:11.440]  Except panic. Yeah, okay cable those guys are just like god
[43:11.440 --> 43:18.200]  They're they're heroes, but I forget which one of their apps was that I don't know if it was coda 1.0 or something
[43:18.200 --> 43:21.080]  It was from you and smith. Oh, yeah, maybe there's an early version
[43:21.080 --> 43:28.320]  But there yeah, there were there were panic apps from 2006 or 2007 maybe even earlier that were resolution independent
[43:28.320 --> 43:33.120]  I'd like PDF assets for everything and they went to extraordinary lengths to do that
[43:33.360 --> 43:40.280]  Yeah, because and cable was the guy I remember going to like WWE the old WWDC sessions. I mean like
[43:41.080 --> 43:45.800]  seriously, probably like close to ten years ago and me and cable sass are hanging out in the back and just
[43:46.560 --> 43:51.960]  Giddy as they were talking about resolution independence because we both like we're thinking next year
[43:51.960 --> 43:57.600]  We're gonna have the max we think we didn't know the word retina, but we thought we were gonna get super high DPI max
[43:57.600 --> 44:01.280]  Yeah next year and we were like just giddy just crazy
[44:01.280 --> 44:05.160]  They're like, there's no way they'd be putting this in WWDC this year if they weren't coming
[44:05.680 --> 44:09.580]  It's like let's start saving our money and cable was like I'm gonna start building up
[44:10.400 --> 44:18.040]  Yeah, it was you know, you know, it it's it's all gonna come to fruition now and there's you know, what the my
[44:18.040 --> 44:24.800]  the red flag for me is it's the fact that they're using a Helvetica noise the
[44:25.840 --> 44:28.400]  System font. Oh, definitely. No doubt about it
[44:28.400 --> 44:32.800]  I mean that that it's okay on a non retina display
[44:33.040 --> 44:36.640]  but you see Helvetica noise on a retina display and it's like
[44:37.400 --> 44:41.960]  Okay, you know the eyes the L's the ones
[44:42.680 --> 44:43.960]  all
[44:43.960 --> 44:50.160]  Look, okay there. It's a little little muddy on a non retina display and
[44:51.200 --> 44:54.980]  Apples making that you know, they're planting the flag saying okay
[44:54.980 --> 45:01.000]  This is the way we're going forward and it's clear that that way forward is
[45:01.640 --> 45:05.800]  Everything's gonna be retina not not just I've said this before but not just in
[45:06.640 --> 45:13.480]  Hindsight having used retina MacBook Pros now for a while, but I've always thought I mean, I mean having used I'm sorry
[45:13.480 --> 45:15.480]  I told using
[45:15.600 --> 45:22.320]  Yosemite on a retina MacBook Pro for the last couple months Yosemite in particular not just because ever since the retina MacBook Pros
[45:22.840 --> 45:27.440]  Shipped I thought that the aqua interface looked a little weird
[45:27.440 --> 45:32.680]  I thought the displays looked beautiful and I thought everything about the UI looked a little weird look fake
[45:32.920 --> 45:33.520]  You know
[45:33.520 --> 45:41.000]  It always looked to me like a fake version of Mac OS that somebody made for a like a Marvel superhero movie
[45:41.000 --> 45:46.880]  So it would look really cool big on screen like they faked it and and you know
[45:46.880 --> 45:52.680]  I love Lucida Grande. I mean, I still love it, but it looked a little
[45:53.360 --> 45:57.600]  Janky on retina to my eye. Yeah, because well and it's you know, I
[45:58.000 --> 46:01.760]  Got it. There's a reason why you don't see that font used in print
[46:02.200 --> 46:08.600]  Right or sell to see it you very seldom see Lucida Grande in print because it just isn't
[46:08.600 --> 46:13.720]  You know, it was designed to look good with chunky pixels and it did a great job of it
[46:13.720 --> 46:19.480]  I mean it looked great on, you know, non retina displays look better than alvetica on non render this place
[46:19.480 --> 46:25.440]  It did it served its job for over a decade fantastically, but then once it went retina, it looked weird
[46:25.560 --> 46:29.320]  It's because it's just not this isn't a great font at high resolution
[46:30.040 --> 46:32.400]  yeah, you know the people that are complaining about
[46:32.400 --> 46:34.080]  The
[46:34.080 --> 46:38.040]  Helvetica noia not being a you know humanist font and and
[46:38.880 --> 46:46.080]  You know, it's I think I can get that as as far as you know content is concerned and you know
[46:46.080 --> 46:51.640]  it's like yeah, maybe your content in your app should be displayed in some other kind of font, but
[46:52.440 --> 46:58.840]  You know menu bars and dialog boxes and stuff like that. It's really no different than road signs
[46:58.840 --> 47:02.760]  Right. Yeah, it's navigation right it did, you know and
[47:03.600 --> 47:05.440]  Helvetica
[47:05.440 --> 47:12.040]  excels at you know, you just go out in public, you know, you know get on the New York City subway and
[47:13.440 --> 47:17.160]  Notice that Helvetica is all over the place. It's good at doing that
[47:18.240 --> 47:19.760]  I
[47:19.760 --> 47:23.480]  think that you know Apple moving to that as a
[47:23.480 --> 47:29.560]  System font. It's something that you know, that lets us navigate through our apps. It's a good thing
[47:30.080 --> 47:35.160]  Hold that thought because it's it comes back to another thing. I want to make about print design
[47:36.680 --> 47:42.200]  And UI design but let me I get it. Yep, they're gonna get another sponsor me do something and why don't I follow up?
[47:43.080 --> 47:47.840]  Casper with the actual one I compared them to Warby Parker our good friends at Warby Parker
[47:50.400 --> 47:52.400]  Super stylish really cool
[47:52.400 --> 47:58.680]  Low-priced well-crafted eyewear. That's what Warby Parker does you've heard me talk about it before right?
[47:58.680 --> 48:00.520]  They go there you go to the website
[48:00.520 --> 48:05.200]  they have a whole bunch of frames really cool really cool stuff on the website to help you kind of
[48:05.400 --> 48:08.800]  See what they would look like on your face take a webcam picture and just you know
[48:09.000 --> 48:14.200]  What does this look like on my face and they do an amazing job kind of guessing the distance between your eyes and stuff?
[48:14.200 --> 48:16.200]  like that
[48:16.680 --> 48:20.880]  Then you pick five pairs of glasses that you like they ship them to you
[48:20.880 --> 48:25.760]  Free they just show up, but they you know, none of your prescription lenses that you just try them on at home
[48:25.760 --> 48:27.600]  look in the mirror see what your
[48:27.600 --> 48:29.600]  significant other things you look best in
[48:30.720 --> 48:34.400]  and then if you find one or more pairs that you like you buy them and
[48:34.640 --> 48:38.960]  If you don't you send them all back and then a couple days later you get the glasses you picked
[48:40.560 --> 48:42.560]  No upsells on stuff like
[48:42.560 --> 48:50.880]  UV coating or anti-glare or anything like that all glasses include that everything includes the anti-glare everything includes the
[48:51.840 --> 48:56.560]  Anti-reflective coating no additional cost all their glasses come with a hard case
[48:57.120 --> 49:02.400]  We have a bunch of them in the house now really cool case good cleaning cloth everything like that
[49:03.280 --> 49:05.680]  They have titanium frames metal ones
[49:05.680 --> 49:13.760]  They start at one hundred and forty-five dollars and their regular ones start at just ninety-five bucks
[49:14.560 --> 49:19.440]  They do an awesome thing where every time they sell a pair of glasses prescription glasses
[49:19.680 --> 49:23.840]  they also send a pair of prescription glasses to
[49:25.040 --> 49:32.000]  People in need around the world who need prescription glasses almost a billion people around worldwide lack access to prescription glasses
[49:32.480 --> 49:34.480]  15% of the global population
[49:34.480 --> 49:35.760]  so
[49:35.760 --> 49:40.640]  They've pop partnered with various nonprofits including there's one here called vision spring
[49:40.960 --> 49:46.080]  To ensure that for every pair of glasses warby parker sells another pair is distributed to someone in need
[49:46.480 --> 49:48.480]  It's a great deal at a great price
[49:50.080 --> 49:54.240]  What were we talking about we were talking about older eyes get eyes getting older they have
[49:55.180 --> 49:59.280]  Progressive lenses that start at just two hundred ninety-five dollars including frames
[50:00.960 --> 50:02.960]  That's a lot more money, but i'll tell you what prescription
[50:02.960 --> 50:08.980]  Uh, progressive lenses they're the ones that have they have a distance prescription at the top of the lens and then they transition
[50:09.280 --> 50:13.840]  To a reading lens near the lens's bottom without any kind of harsh line or anything like that
[50:14.480 --> 50:17.120]  Um, usually those things are super super expensive
[50:17.680 --> 50:20.240]  Yeah, regular doctor. Yeah, there's started just
[50:21.260 --> 50:23.260]  295 bucks
[50:24.480 --> 50:27.200]  Really really cool stuff so go there check them out
[50:27.280 --> 50:31.840]  You need new glasses next time you need glasses or sunglasses prescription go to warby parker
[50:31.840 --> 50:33.760]  Warby parker
[50:33.760 --> 50:38.080]  Com slash the talk show. They've got the the in there the talk show
[50:38.720 --> 50:41.440]  And they have a special deal. What is the special deal here?
[50:42.880 --> 50:47.040]  I think anybody who uses that deal gets uh free shipping
[50:48.400 --> 50:53.600]  So they'll send them. Um, they'll get on one right away use that code and uh
[50:54.880 --> 50:58.080]  You get free shipping. So my thanks to warby parker
[50:58.080 --> 51:00.720]  Go buy them go go check them out to buy your glasses
[51:01.360 --> 51:03.360]  so print design
[51:03.360 --> 51:06.640]  I wanted to make this point a couple minutes ago and you reminded me of talking about the fonts
[51:08.160 --> 51:14.960]  I that's the world I came from coming out of college in the 90s. I knew cork express and I did print design
[51:15.520 --> 51:18.960]  And I you know knew how to do exact layouts
[51:18.960 --> 51:25.760]  But it wasn't down to what's the equivalent of the pixel which would be the dot of toner right if we had a 600 dpi
[51:25.760 --> 51:33.280]  laser printer we didn't we did, you know, there's no way in cork or illustrator or something like that to do
[51:34.400 --> 51:36.400]  Dot of toner perfect design
[51:36.800 --> 51:43.120]  Right and yeah 600 dpi laser printer is higher than any of these dpis we're talking about but if it's right that we have a
[51:43.760 --> 51:46.000]  461 pixel print phone coming up
[51:46.720 --> 51:51.200]  That's actually in the ballpark right where you really shouldn't be caring about the pixels
[51:51.200 --> 51:56.640]  And that if you specify if you just tell uh, the os give me how you know
[51:56.640 --> 51:59.440]  I want to draw half the screen black half white
[52:00.320 --> 52:03.440]  If the black half is actually one pixel
[52:04.080 --> 52:10.480]  Larger than the white half that looks like half and half exactly. There's no reason you shouldn't be worried about that
[52:10.480 --> 52:12.480]  You should just say half right?
[52:12.720 --> 52:17.200]  It would be just the same way that in cork express if I made an eight and a half by 11 sheet of paper
[52:17.200 --> 52:21.200]  And I just drew a line at the halfway mark on the ruler
[52:22.080 --> 52:29.120]  I don't know when it comes out on the piece of paper whether it's actually a half to the dot. It's it's close enough
[52:29.440 --> 52:34.320]  Actually, actually probably what would happen is you'd have an even number even number of black pixels
[52:34.960 --> 52:42.400]  A 50 gray pixel one single and then all white. I mean just there would be some sort of anti-aliasing there
[52:42.400 --> 52:48.080]  I mean just there would be some sort of anti-aliasing there right, but which would just make it smooth and look nice
[52:48.560 --> 52:51.600]  Right, but I don't think we're supposed to worry about that. Yeah, exactly
[52:51.680 --> 52:56.960]  I that that is kind of the takeaway for me is that it's like, you know, just give it up
[52:57.120 --> 52:59.120]  you know, it's like the design is
[53:00.160 --> 53:05.120]  How you're going to stroke these elements how you're going to you know, how are they balanced between each other?
[53:05.280 --> 53:08.240]  It's you know, you think about design at a higher level then
[53:08.240 --> 53:11.840]  Okay, it's 10 pixels of padding
[53:11.840 --> 53:17.920]  You know 15 pixels of content another 10 pixels of padding, you know, you got 25 pixels, right?
[53:17.920 --> 53:20.400]  And it's not about getting sloppy or not caring
[53:21.120 --> 53:28.160]  It's about caring at its slightly higher level, right care about it at the level of points and percentages
[53:28.240 --> 53:33.600]  But don't don't worry about it at the pixel level anymore. Well that and that's you know, the response of
[53:33.600 --> 53:37.520]  Uh web designs, you know the whole thing that ethan mark got is
[53:38.160 --> 53:43.520]  Champion right is that you know think about things in percentages, right?
[53:43.840 --> 53:47.440]  I want 100 of my page width to show this paragraph
[53:48.560 --> 53:54.320]  Uh, no, I really want 50 of my you know, it's like how many pixels that who the you know, who cares
[53:55.600 --> 53:58.320]  Now somewhere out there are our good friends. Um
[53:59.440 --> 54:01.440]  Many of them your colleagues
[54:01.440 --> 54:05.360]  Who are pixel designer or not pixel icon designers? Sure
[54:06.800 --> 54:13.360]  And you know what they have not been for error. No, no, no, no, no, no, they have not been dealing with pixels for
[54:14.160 --> 54:18.400]  Years, I really know. See that's why I want to have you on the show. It's
[54:19.600 --> 54:23.840]  Again, you know, you've got to think about things at a higher level. I mean, I think
[54:25.440 --> 54:30.080]  They'll probably correct me when they hear this, but I believe they work in illustrator at
[54:30.080 --> 54:33.280]  Illustrator at 2048 by 2048 pixels
[54:33.920 --> 54:35.920]  That's where they start off
[54:37.280 --> 54:38.400]  And
[54:38.400 --> 54:42.800]  They then scale it down to whatever pixel size, you know the client requests
[54:43.520 --> 54:48.320]  But they're working at some ridiculously large size, you know, and they're thinking about
[54:49.120 --> 54:52.340]  How things balance out in that large canvas?
[54:52.340 --> 54:59.300]  Um, you know what the final rendering size is really just an implementation detail
[55:00.340 --> 55:03.220]  You know, it's just something that you know, it's like, okay, they need it
[55:03.860 --> 55:10.020]  You know 512 by 512 and they also need a 256 great. We'll render it out that size
[55:11.780 --> 55:13.380]  Um
[55:13.380 --> 55:19.540]  There I mean we had I mean it used to be that you you'd go into like something like resedit right and click a pixel
[55:20.340 --> 55:21.380]  You know
[55:21.380 --> 55:25.380]  Set, you know say what color you wanted, you know, click another pixel and
[55:26.500 --> 55:30.980]  To be fair that there there is some of that still right, you know, if you take that
[55:31.760 --> 55:33.760]  2048 by 2048
[55:34.340 --> 55:38.660]  Image in illustrator and put it into photoshop and render down at 16 by 16
[55:39.300 --> 55:43.460]  And it's got some text or something on it. You're going to have to go clean up that text, right?
[55:43.540 --> 55:45.540]  It's not going to scale down nicely
[55:45.540 --> 55:52.260]  Uh, and you know, they do that still that is there is some pixel clean up there
[55:53.460 --> 55:55.460]  but to be honest, that's
[55:55.540 --> 56:03.300]  Less and less of you know, something with a client even needs right? I mean, right people don't work with that size anymore
[56:03.620 --> 56:05.620]  I think
[56:05.620 --> 56:07.300]  Yeah, it's
[56:07.300 --> 56:09.300]  You know, we've moved on from that
[56:09.620 --> 56:13.460]  Yeah, I go back to the my you know, my days as a print designer and you know
[56:13.460 --> 56:19.220]  Oh, it sucked when somebody would give you their logo and it was in a bitmap, you know, it's a file or something
[56:19.300 --> 56:21.300]  Yeah, not even if it was
[56:21.300 --> 56:24.820]  You know if it was really low res you'd have to go back to him and say you got to give me something better
[56:24.900 --> 56:28.580]  But even if it was high res it kind of stunk because you knew there was an upper limit, you know
[56:28.900 --> 56:33.700]  God, why can't you just give it to me as a vector and when you did have you know an eps of the logo?
[56:34.260 --> 56:37.940]  You just you didn't really worry about how it was going to turn out you sized it, right?
[56:37.940 --> 56:44.660]  You placed it exactly where you wanted in your layout and QuarkXPress and then you just trusted that when it came off the printer
[56:44.660 --> 56:48.020]  It was gonna look good and we would do things too. I remember with some logos
[56:48.740 --> 56:55.220]  where if it was like a dark background with white text if you knew it was going into
[56:55.700 --> 57:00.100]  Newsprint you might have an alternate version where the text was bolder
[57:00.340 --> 57:04.660]  Because you knew the ink was gonna bleed and to make it look right, you know
[57:04.660 --> 57:08.780]  There were some logos or things like that where you'd have an alternate version
[57:09.580 --> 57:12.300]  For something like newsprint because you knew it was going to bleed a little bit
[57:12.380 --> 57:16.140]  But for the most part you never had to worry about it. Yeah, I think in in
[57:17.100 --> 57:18.140]  in
[57:18.140 --> 57:22.540]  UIs with vector graphics, you know, a lot of people get
[57:23.100 --> 57:24.860]  confused the
[57:24.860 --> 57:30.380]  The graphic that you're using to develop with with the actual graphic that gets rendered on screen
[57:30.380 --> 57:32.380]  You
[57:33.020 --> 57:36.700]  Know when you're talking about what you were doing with QuarkXPress
[57:37.260 --> 57:41.860]  A very important part of that process was the rip right the thing right took that vector
[57:42.300 --> 57:48.300]  Representation and put it into a bitmap which it then could send on to the you know to the press that you know
[57:48.860 --> 57:50.860]  physically print it
[57:51.580 --> 57:55.420]  You know when you say okay, I'm gonna put a PDF into Xcode I
[57:55.420 --> 58:03.500]  Don't know this for a fact, but I'm guessing that all that PDF does is give something Xcode to work on
[58:04.140 --> 58:10.380]  Compile time and Xcode will know that it needs something that's 16 by 16 or it's gonna know that needs something
[58:10.380 --> 58:15.860]  It's 256 by 256 and it'll render it at the appropriate size
[58:15.860 --> 58:24.820]  The reason being is that all our GPUs work with textures, right? They work with bitmaps
[58:25.580 --> 58:32.140]  You know, it's not you don't want a vector representation in your app at runtime. You just don't want that
[58:32.140 --> 58:34.140]  it's it's inefficient right if you have to have a
[58:34.900 --> 58:36.900]  iPhone 6
[58:36.980 --> 58:43.020]  Render out all these PDFs before it can display them on the screen. Your launch time is going to be slower, right?
[58:43.020 --> 58:47.940]  You know, it's gonna take more CP take more CPU. Exactly. It's not I don't know that it works that way though
[58:47.940 --> 58:52.140]  I don't know. I don't I don't either but you know, just knowing how this this works
[58:52.980 --> 58:58.980]  But better to burn burn the developers CPU exactly right, you know once on a Mac Pro
[58:59.580 --> 59:01.580]  You know, no problem
[59:02.540 --> 59:04.540]  so
[59:04.620 --> 59:06.860]  You know you look at kind of Xcode
[59:07.580 --> 59:11.660]  6 is the rip now, right? It's the thing that takes all these vector
[59:11.660 --> 59:17.380]  Definitions it takes our auto layout definitions. It's the thing that
[59:17.980 --> 59:20.340]  That takes all this resolution
[59:21.220 --> 59:26.180]  independence and puts it into a format where at runtime the iPhone or
[59:27.340 --> 59:31.940]  Even you know you somebody now can take that and display it
[59:32.740 --> 59:34.100]  how
[59:34.100 --> 59:36.100]  The user wants to see it
[59:36.820 --> 59:38.620]  and
[59:38.620 --> 59:40.620]  It's a pretty
[59:40.620 --> 59:42.500]  it's
[59:42.500 --> 59:47.700]  It really it's us as developers. We have to kind of let go a little bit
[59:48.420 --> 59:53.860]  To say okay, this is gonna and that in fact web developers already gone through this process, right?
[59:53.860 --> 01:00:00.020]  They're when they talk about responsive web designs. There's they're letting go of the notion that everything's going to align
[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:02.980]  perfectly according to
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:10.180]  Their Photoshop mock-up. It's not it's not right. It's just not and what
[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:17.760]  Works, you know, what auto layout is saying and what these size classes are saying it's like in these different scenarios
[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:20.820]  this is kind of how you want things to lay out and
[01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:26.780]  You don't necessarily know that it's gonna lay out exactly
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.340]  The way you expect it to lay out. I mean, yeah
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:34.500]  Who's to say who's to say that your font settings are?
[01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:41.760]  You know, you know, that's you know, I in iOS you can go and say I want larger type
[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:44.020]  Yeah, right
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:48.140]  How how big how big yeah, how big is the text bubble in in?
[01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:50.580]  messages
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:56.060]  You know, how big is a text bubble? That's three lines of text. I bet in my iMessage
[01:00:56.060 --> 01:01:03.460]  Message it's going to be larger than in yours. Yeah, cuz I'm 13 years older. Yeah, I'll bet it is. I
[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:09.300]  Think there's another thing too that's implicit in the message coming from Apple
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:15.200]  Which is you can't look even if we add two new phones and one of them is seven hundred and fifty
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:17.900]  pixels wide and the other one is
[01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:21.420]  1200 and whatever 1224
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:29.500]  Don't take that as meaning. Okay. Now I can expect either 640 or 750 or
[01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:34.700]  No, stop thinking that you can make a list of the expected widths
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:42.020]  You should make an app that is ready for anyway, right? You know it in instead of just 704. Maybe it's
[01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:45.820]  703 doesn't matter your app should be ready for that
[01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:52.560]  You know that there's no there shouldn't be any reasonable width in that area that your app isn't ready to handle
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:57.580]  because I think it also ties into another rumor, which is the rumor of
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:04.860]  split-screen multitasking on the iPad right and you know and possibly combine that with
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:10.480]  New iPad sizes if they come out with it, you know a bigger pro size iPad
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:16.700]  Yeah, that there's some there's some problematic things as far as that split-screen on the iPad and you know
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:18.900]  The whole you know status bar
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.960]  like oh
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.520]  There's totally problems and I'm curious to see how it goes
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:27.040]  But I'll tell you the there's no doubt my mind know that part of the message is
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:35.160]  Don't don't assume you can you you're gonna you can expect the right to be from this short list of numbers
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:39.400]  Right the width could be anything. Yeah, exactly. And if it turns out
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:45.120]  That this iPhone really does ship with a width of 750 and a weird 1334 height
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.840]  instead of
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:53.900]  1336 by 752 which would be neater. I think that that's that's Apple explicitly telling us
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:03:01.880]  Stop stop trying to do pixel-perfect 16 by 16 pixel grid displays, you know designs. Yeah
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.720]  What's gonna happen with?
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:12.600]  iOS apps that are haven't been updated haven't been updated for iOS 7 even I
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.960]  Mean, I've got I've got some apps that are still
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.280]  iOS 6
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:24.880]  you know, yeah that that keyboard comes up and it's like it's I can tell what the shift key is, but other than that I
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.440]  Don't like it
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:27.240]  You know what?
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:31.560]  It's gotten to the point now where I find that I have a couple of those apps too and I've gotten to the point
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:36.400]  Where I for whatever reason even though it doesn't make any sense because it has no actual physical feel
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:41.000]  I find that I can't typewrite on it anymore. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's weird. It's
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.160]  But I tell you the shift key is better
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:49.820]  It's a constant reminder that why is Apple being so
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:55.200]  Reluctant to change that to fix it. I would love I've I have no idea
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:01.360]  There's gotta be somebody up high in that company that says no. No, it's better this way
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:08.400]  Somebody has somebody has taken control of that. Nobody nobody over this person. It cares enough to overrule
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:11.600]  Yeah, and nobody under them has been able to persuade them. Yes
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:19.140]  It's it and I you know here it's what been a year and I'm still
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.800]  Getting confused by it
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:28.420]  It's like it's like the it's like the USB cables, right? You know, yeah, it was. Oh, no, I got a shifted enough
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:31.600]  Put it in there. I got it
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:41.680]  It takes three tries it takes three tries to get the shift right did you see the tweet from speaking of God?
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:51.400]  It's by far and away it's why I love Steven so much because I'd never quite thought of it
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:55.320]  So there's rampant rumors that Apple is gonna come out with a reversible USB switch
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:59.340]  That's going to just work in existing USB sockets
[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:03.280]  and if you look Google if you haven't seen it Google it look at the patent and
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:08.640]  The diagram makes total sense where it's you know, it's like a they call it a tongue
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:12.080]  It's a tongue that would go up or down depending on which way you put it in
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:17.560]  So it would be reversible and Stephen Frank's tweet was are you meaning to tell me that for the last 15 years?
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.680]  nothing
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:22.760]  Technically stopping us from having reversible USB cables
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:30.500]  And it is such a fascinating way to word it because it's like oh my god how many times have I plugged it tried
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:36.720]  How many collectively how many man-hours have been wasted with USB cables being plugged in wrong?
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:40.860]  It's gotta be it's gotta be a staggering number because everybody does it
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:46.840]  I don't know about anybody else, but I'd like do it at least once a day. Yeah. Yeah, it's only five seconds
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:52.560]  But on those Apple white chargers, I never got up and down never know which one's up and down
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:58.200]  So it doesn't help me to look at the cable and say oh the USB logo is up. So I'll put it in this way
[01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.200]  I don't know which way the thing is in the socket
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:04.520]  like it, you know, it's all combined with the fact that in the US are
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:13.800]  Our electrical sockets are reversible for a lot of plugs including those little white adapter plugs. If it's not a three-prong plug you can
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:19.100]  Put the charger in upside down and even with the three-prong ones on some
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.240]  Wall sockets that are upside down. Yeah
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.480]  something getting that means that
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:34.160]  I've got 130 pin connector on my desk still just for an old test device and I tell you the lightning being
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:39.040]  Reversible it's it's it's it seems like a stupid little thing. Oh
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:45.280]  But it's just like oh, this is so much better. I have a rant in me
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:48.360]  I don't know that I've ever expressed it, but I think in hindsight
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:54.900]  That the lightning adapter is the most appley thing Apple has done in ten years
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:07:01.380]  It's the single it's it just epitomizes everything that either it's like killing the iPad mini, right?
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:08.680]  It's like it was there. Everybody loved it worked great. All the hotels had it. It's like no screw it
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:13.460]  Yeah, yeah, I would say go better, you know, maybe the one previous prior to it was that the iPod
[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:18.720]  Nuking the iPad mini even it was the most popular device on the planet for the iPod nano
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:21.980]  Even though they were switching the more expensive components. Yeah
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:28.620]  Yeah, I think doing it where everybody in industry uses these finicky little micro USB things
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:35.200]  That are horrible because I still have to deal with them with like my Kindle I have to deal with them with the Mophie
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:40.860]  And now that I've gotten used to lightning. It's only gotten worse because I don't have patience for it and I just stabbed
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:47.520]  It cracks me up when we travel, you know, you arrive in a hotel room and it's you know
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:50.120]  It's like they've got like the little you know
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:55.520]  They oh we we have an iPod charger in the room and you go over and it's a 30-bit connect
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:58.520]  Yeah, okay
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:05.440]  In another five years you guys will get with the program. All right, like hotels are on like a 15 year
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.160]  Refurbishment cycle and it's like that just does not work with something like phone charge
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:16.680]  But I also think that the lightning adapter in addition to being what I love about Apple that they're like
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.680]  We don't care what everybody else is doing
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:23.160]  And we're not happy with what we ourselves have we're not happy with our proprietary
[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:28.960]  30 pin plug because we could do so much but they were annoyed by their own ugly adapter and they're like we can make it
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:35.320]  Smaller we can make it reversible and that would be just eliminate a huge annoyance from all of our lives
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:39.040]  But it's also what drives some people who don't like Apple crazy
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:44.120]  Which is why don't they just use micro USB and then every phone on the planet would have the same adapter?
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.360]  Which I have to admit that's that's not
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:54.720]  Unreasonable, you know, it's a trade-off. Do you want to you know, do what everybody else does or do you want to try to do?
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:55.920]  something better
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:02.000]  Yeah, well, I look at micro USB and it's like it's the epitome of design by committee, right?
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.580]  it's just and it and it was it was defined by a
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:06.740]  consortium of
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:12.120]  companies that were saying let's make a universal serial connector, right and
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:16.240]  Things that are designed by committee are often
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:23.600]  Not optimal right now and I look at the lightning connector and it's pretty optimal
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:26.280]  Yeah, it's it's
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:28.860]  Effect, you know, they've done some crazy stuff with that
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:33.420]  Well at the very least it's better than anything I've ever seen from anybody else. Yeah
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:35.520]  Yeah
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:38.560]  Mark Edwards, this is going back about five minutes mark Edwards
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:42.080]  Who I think was very much in doubt
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:47.200]  About my predictions for screen sizes and he had a tweet earlier
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:51.920]  You know a day or so after I published where he he was, you know, something defective
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:55.140]  He was very skeptical of any screen sizes that aren't divisible by 16
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:58.680]  but then he went he did something understand I didn't think to do is
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:07.220]  Made a whole list of recent iMac MacBook Pro MacBook Air iPad and etc
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:11.220]  Devices and
[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:16.100]  Saw which ones were divisible by 32 16 8 4 and
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:26.820]  The MacBook Air there's an 11-inch there there's an 11-inch MacBook Air that isn't divisible by any of those numbers that it's got a
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:34.000]  1366 screen size width which isn't even divisible by 4 let alone 8 or 16
[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:37.040]  There's a
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:44.140]  13-inch MacBook Air where the height is 900 which is only divisible by 4 not even by 8
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:48.840]  And there's a couple others that aren't divisible by 16
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:55.500]  So it's not completely unprecedented like that was there was a bunch of people who were like hey graphics cards want everything in
[01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:57.500]  16 pixel increments
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:01.720]  That may be so but that hasn't stopped Apple with MacBooks before
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:08.320]  Yeah, well again, it's just a matter getting those textures that on the GPU which and the textures are gonna be
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:12.600]  By the line, you know that just for performance reasons, right?
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:18.120]  You know the whole graphics pipeline is it's gonna want to be you know, even numbers probably
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:25.440]  You know even word sizes, you know, so right there's something that's gonna line to 64 bits or 32 bits
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:28.940]  Or whatever that the bit size is for the right
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:32.720]  So in other words, they'll round up for when they're sending stuff to the GPU
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:38.120]  Yeah, they're just over right, you know, it's like okay. Yeah. Okay it you know those last two pixels
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:44.220]  That would have been perfect. Just go off into the ether. They don't actually go to the display. So yeah, it's
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:50.360]  Again you know, that's you know the the
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:52.360]  We
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.640]  For so long, you know, we've
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:58.280]  we've been tied to
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:06.760]  Display hardware's is the thing that is driving our operating systems our rest of the resolutions in our software
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:10.000]  That you know the the dimensions in our software
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:16.940]  And that's the thing that's going away is that we
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:18.940]  We
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:26.400]  We've got to stop thinking about the hardware and start thinking about our designs thinking about our layouts
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:34.740]  Yeah, that's gonna be our that's gonna be a hard thing that you know, as you know we've all you know
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:43.760]  It's like that's the thing that you know, this this odd number width and height for the 4.7 inch display
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:48.820]  Just makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:57.760]  Because I know because I know it's gonna cause problems right it's like, you know when we went from from 32 bits to 64 bits
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:02.080]  Right. It's like oh, it was just you know, twice as big was it?
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:07.840]  But yeah, you make assumptions in your software all over the place that well, this integer is gonna be 16 bits
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.960]  ever forever, right
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:16.320]  You know, it's never gonna change. It's only 16 bits. So, you know, then all of a sudden it's like 32 bits. Oh
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:22.080]  Crap, I remember I remember it. I remember 8-bit ints. Yeah, I remember into that
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:24.720]  Max out at what is that?
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:27.720]  665 535. Yeah. Yeah
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:30.760]  yes, that that was the
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:34.680]  8-bit microprocessor with a 16-bit address space
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:39.180]  Right, it's like you had to declare a long
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:44.280]  To get a six, but you know again, you know
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:50.840]  For the sometimes we pass out Pascal strings were 256 characters exactly
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:55.520]  Exactly. You had to have that that bite in there to tell you how long the string was. It's like, you know
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:58.840]  You weren't uni killed with that
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:03.840]  You have to think it's like we
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:10.640]  Throughout the history of of computing right? We've we've taken shortcuts either for
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:19.760]  You know caused by laziness or either as a deliberate. Yeah deliberate act for performance
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:24.800]  We have shortcuts all over our code
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:31.680]  And I don't think for example, I don't think the 32 kilobyte limit in the original text edit controls
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:37.680]  In Mac OS, I don't think that was laziness. I think that was a very practical decision
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:42.160]  Given the constraints of the original Mac hardware
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:45.120]  But then eventually we had all these apps
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:51.720]  With all these text fields that were using the system text edit control that couldn't show more than 32 kilobytes of text
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:58.560]  All right, you know and eventually it was you know, the computers clearly had the you know, the memory to allow it
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:01.040]  But now you had all this software to rewrite
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.080]  Yeah
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:07.040]  It wasn't saying the same thing with with you know, utf, right? It's like
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:11.680]  utf really didn't take off until utf-8 came around because it could
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.040]  handle
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:16.040]  the old ASCII
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:18.080]  character sets
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:23.440]  well, but then you could add on you know, you could have special sequences of
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:30.520]  Character strings that would I would hold that up. I would hold up utf-8 as a pretty good
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:37.560]  Designed by committee. Yeah, very pragmatic. Very very pragmatic
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:43.080]  I remember I'd and maybe I'm misremembering this but I seem to remember that there were an awful lot of people
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:47.920]  Who thought it was who who who held their nose at utf-8 and we're like, well
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:51.280]  It'll be a stopgap for a year or two before everybody switches to utf-16
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:54.960]  right and it was like utf-16 was like the equivalent of
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:04.320]  HTML 4.0 strict right, you know the HTML standards that never really are X HTML
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:08.520]  Right, like it was the way things were supposed to be right
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:15.000]  We'll let you we'll let you have your tag soup HTML now, but soon we'll switch to X HTML
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:21.280]  And if you're if you're if you're web page, it doesn't validate as an XML document will throw up an error
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:28.680]  Utf I feel like the people on who did utf-8 were like
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:34.280]  We'll let those eggheads go and blather on and in the meantime, we'll make very practical
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:40.360]  System that is actually, you know going to work and a few years later
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:45.880]  Along comes utf-32, right because they ran out of space with the 16
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:54.200]  It's classic, right? It's like oh, you know 16 bits should be enough for anybody any character set, you know, that's like
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.040]  Sorry, right
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:00.040]  You've got to go change all your code now
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:02.560]  Right, they effectively
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:05.040]  We made the same to sit they made the same mistake that
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:09.360]  That we ran into the first time with 256 character
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:15.440]  Yeah, and the thing that cracks me up is utf-8 is never more than 32 bits long, right? So
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:18.320]  worst case it's
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.800]  equal to the maximum
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:23.760]  utf-32 words are
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:29.180]  So yeah, yeah and in the common case, it's way smaller than you. Oh, yeah. Yeah
[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:31.500]  so anyway
[01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:37.780]  On with that. Let me take another break here and thank our good friends at Squarespace. You guys know Squarespace

[01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:46.140]  So go go there and check them out my thanks to Squarespace. I got a question for you Craig. Yeah
[01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:50.220]  We were talking about this before I kind of cut you off because I wanted to go deep on it in between
[01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:52.580]  sponsor breaks
[01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:54.260]  How do you think?
[01:19:54.260 --> 01:20:00.900]  Legacy apps are gonna run on the new iPhones. Oh, right. Yeah, so we have two kinds that you you you said ones
[01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:03.660]  I weren't even updated for iOS 7. I was just thinking about size
[01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:06.300]  Yeah
[01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:13.920]  Um, I've given a lot of thought to this I think I actually haven't so I'm gonna I'm just gonna kind of
[01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:16.220]  here so
[01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:20.980]  With the aspect ratio staying the same. It's a to me a totally different change
[01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:25.260]  from the iPhone 4 to the iPhone 5
[01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:30.340]  where they letterboxed it and they had black at the top and bottom and they just ran it at the
[01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:37.660]  Pixel for pixel same size and if you didn't update for the new 16 to 9 display, you just got I call it letterboxed
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:39.660]  Right. You just had black bar, right?
[01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:44.460]  So the equivalent now would be to letter you'd have to letterbox on all four sides
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:46.820]  Because there's gonna be more pixels in both dimensions
[01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:53.260]  So if they did the same thing, you would get a 640 by 1136 app in the middle of your screen
[01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:56.740]  I don't think they'll do that. The thing that that
[01:20:56.740 --> 01:21:00.180]  That is complicated. There is that
[01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:02.860]  you've got
[01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:08.660]  Apps that are potentially using auto layout or you got apps that are potentially using
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:11.260]  strings and spreads
[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:12.860]  springs and struts
[01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:14.860]  which are
[01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:18.260]  an older technology, but allow you to make
[01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:25.100]  Adaptive layouts not quite as elegantly as the new way with auto layout, but they still can't adapt
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:27.100]  um
[01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:33.740]  Do you think that it's possible though that even without recompiling with the iOS 8 SDK and submitting an update
[01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:38.180]  Yeah, that's I don't that's the question. I think you're gonna have to submit an update
[01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:42.980]  I think you're gonna have to have to flip some bid in your code saying yeah, I've tested this
[01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:47.780]  It's gonna have to go through app review again, and they're gonna say yep. This looks okay
[01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:53.900]  I think depending on how you wrote your app to this date if you use things like springs and struts or if you've if you
[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:56.100]  I think if you've been using auto layout, you're probably in good shape
[01:21:56.380 --> 01:22:01.620]  But you're still gonna have to at least recompile it and like you said do something in a p-list
[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:04.740]  You know your info dot p-list that says I'm ready for you know
[01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:07.720]  It was like it's like what we had to do with
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:14.620]  With the new tall screen, you know the four inch screen, right? It was a matter of putting in a new
[01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:21.880]  Launch image that said, you know, that was the right size. So it's like oh, okay. They got the new launch image
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:24.500]  They're okay for the iPhone 5. I
[01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:30.300]  Think if you don't if you're you know, like let's say you just haven't submitted you just your app is just sitting there
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:36.040]  You don't there is no update to the app the app that's there today in August is still there in
[01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:39.900]  you know late September when the new iPhone ships and
[01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:45.660]  You launch it on the phone. I think it will the system will scale the app
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:48.580]  to fill the screen
[01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:54.360]  So in the same way it would be like if it's I if it's compatible with the iPhone 5. Yeah
[01:22:55.220 --> 01:23:02.460]  Yeah, yeah, if it's something iOS 6 that's you know, there are still apps out there that are running on
[01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:10.420]  Five-inch displays. I mean that that's one of the problems with the App Store right now is that there's so many apps out there that
[01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:16.220]  I've never seen an update because it's not profitable for the developer who wrote the app
[01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:20.340]  Or it was a commission, you know some somebody hired
[01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:24.940]  contractors and they submitted and they were all gung-ho and then the contracts over and now the app just
[01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:29.380]  Sits there and never gets updated because there isn't even a team of developers
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:35.540]  Who are choosing not to update it? They were hired the contracts over in the app. It's just there
[01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:37.740]  I don't know what they're gonna do. I
[01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:42.580]  Maybe for like an app that still assumes a three three point five inch screen
[01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:47.500]  It'll zoom to fill the width and they'll still have black bars at the top and bottom
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:52.800]  I can't imagine that they would stretch it, you know, that's good. I think it'll just fill the width
[01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:58.220]  You know, I'm gonna I'm only thinking about the common case which is apps that are
[01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:02.360]  iOS 7 apps that are you know, it's already 16 to 9 but that they're
[01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:05.360]  hard-coded for 640 by 11 36
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:10.140]  I think that the system will scale them dynamically to fill the screen and
[01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:13.500]  I don't think it'll look that bad
[01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:20.900]  I think the people who really do notice pixel level details will be appalled and they'll be if if you know for designers and
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:24.460]  Developers who have apps in the store. They're gonna be motivated to get them updated as quickly as possible
[01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:31.460]  But I think it'll do you think it'll stretch images? Yeah, I think it'll stretch everything because they're all at 16 to 9
[01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:33.660]  It'll stretch in proportion
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:38.500]  That's what I think because I don't think I I think Apple would rather have
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:44.380]  in apps that look a little blurry and I don't think it'll look nearly as blurry as
[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:47.820]  Because I've played with yeah
[01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:52.780]  It won't be like when we went from 1x to 2x or even right
[01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:56.700]  For it won't look like that three and a half inch to four inch. Yeah, right
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:57.100]  well
[01:24:57.100 --> 01:25:02.140]  1x to 2x is probably the best example where if you had an app that wasn't updated for retina and you launched it on the
[01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:05.740]  iPhone 4 it just looked terrible. Yeah, it's not gonna look like that
[01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:11.180]  I've taken like screenshots of springboard and Vesper and a few other apps and just
[01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:17.100]  scaled them up in acorn by the multiple and then just shown them on at
[01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:20.500]  100% size on like a retina iPad and
[01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:23.220]  It's not
[01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:30.740]  Obviously, it can't be pixel perfect crisp, but it's not that bad and I think it is sort of comparable
[01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:33.640]  It's a little bit worse, but it's sort of comparable to the retina
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:39.920]  MacBook Pro scaling we talked about earlier. Yeah show I think the average person won't notice
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:42.600]  If the text is scaled correctly
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:46.080]  Right. Yeah, if the name that comes out crisp
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:53.400]  Then you're gonna get away with a lot, right? Yeah, you know, yeah, they're gonna be designers out there that are like, you know
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:56.440]  screeching and moaning about
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:00.360]  The you know, they're a little bit aliasing in those images
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:08.280]  Well, then get stretching and get your update submitted exactly, but you know that that if the text is readable
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  You know, that's the thing that
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:15.120]  You know, a lot of people are driven by what they see textually
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:20.560]  Yeah by what they see graphically well, and you know, it's just an awful lot of what we do
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:26.540]  You know reading messages their text for reading emails their text for reading web pages. It's mostly text
[01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:33.020]  You know and video will be just fine. It'll be a little blurrier than it would be if it was updated natively but
[01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:40.500]  Well, I think maybe not maybe not even video because a lot of apps use the standard movie player controller
[01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:42.860]  Yeah, you're right. And in which case it'll just should just work
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:48.500]  I think the big thing is that somebody who's blunks down the money for the big-ass
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:51.100]  5.5 inch iPhone
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:56.780]  Which I think is gonna carry $100 price premium at least because it's you know
[01:26:56.780 --> 01:27:00.860]  Got this super big display and everything and I think they're gonna be able to get away with that
[01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:06.140]  I think there's gonna be demand that justifies it you spunk down the money to get a big-ass
[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:12.720]  5.5 inch iPhone and it's gonna be big and then all of your non Apple apps are small
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.720]  I just think that's a non-starter
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:18.660]  Like as long you know, you buy a big phone you expect big apps
[01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:25.260]  And even if they're a little blurry that's better than having them run in a ridiculous silly little
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:27.780]  letter boxed on all four sides
[01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:32.380]  Rectangle in the middle of your screen. I think they're just gonna scale it and be done with it and that's it
[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:39.420]  You know and of going from the 4-inch phone to the 4.7 inch phone is not even that big of a scaling factor
[01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:42.860]  I think scaling them up for the 5.5 inch is gonna be a little a
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:48.620]  Little gross, but still won't be anywhere near as bad as the the 1x apps on the 2x
[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:54.700]  iPhone were back in 2010 and they did that. Yeah, what is the percentage increase? It's
[01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:58.500]  68 percent, so it'll be one point six eight
[01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:02.980]  But they're gonna have all those extra pixels to smooth it out
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:12.060]  Right, I just think it's gonna end up being surprising compared to those of us who still are scarred from what the 1x apps looked
[01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:14.860]  like on the original retina iPhone 4
[01:28:15.980 --> 01:28:19.340]  It's even on the 5.5 inch phone. I don't think it's gonna be that bad
[01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:24.200]  And I wouldn't be surprised if they do something where if you're using, you know
[01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:31.620]  UI text or something like that that it's that the text will will scale at the right, you know with the right proportions
[01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:33.700]  Yeah, but the I could see things
[01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:39.300]  Falling apart if you know say somebody has a text to you and they say okay
[01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:45.340]  I want this image to draw, you know 10 pixels to the right of this text you for some reason, right?
[01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:52.860]  How does how does the system handle that right? How does it know what to what the right thing to do is?
[01:28:57.300 --> 01:29:00.580]  Yeah, it's not gonna be imperfect but I think that's what they're gonna do
[01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:03.940]  I definitely think they're gonna scale them to fill the screen. I really yeah
[01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:08.020]  Well that there's definitely gonna be motivation for developers to get there
[01:29:08.020 --> 01:29:12.860]  Apps, I mean and the and the fact is that any
[01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:17.020]  Responsible developer has had since June
[01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:23.860]  To look at this stuff and to run it in a simulator and all sorts of weird sizes and make sure it does the right thing
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:26.900]  I
[01:29:26.900 --> 01:29:30.100]  Know we've done it with our apps. It's just you know
[01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:33.340]  you want to avoid surprises, but
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:40.440]  Again, there are gonna be you know, those development teams that were put together to build an app and the you know
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:47.880]  The marketing budget paid for the app and the marketing people don't understand what size classes mean or even the fact, you know
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:49.440]  They told there's a bigger iPhone
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:55.320]  What does that mean and until they actually see their app running on that iPhone and and go oh crap
[01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:57.880]  Yeah, we gotta fix this
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:00.400]  Those guys back in here. I
[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:03.240]  Remember that I remember hearing about the stories like that one
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:08.080]  Like when the retina iPhone. Yeah, it was a crap, you know
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:16.920]  If the old iPhone was so made had such an amazing screen how bad could it look on the new screen?
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:20.560]  Yeah, and then only when it came out where they yeah where they appalled and
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:28.360]  Started jumping all over it. Yeah as geeks we tended to be more sensitive to that than most people
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:34.880]  but yeah, most people can tell when then, you know presented with this stuff that it's like that's not right it
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:37.880]  opens up a lot of
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:45.080]  Interesting scenarios too as far as Apple's concerned right once you have this notion of
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:50.100]  UIs that can adapt to different sizes, right? Well
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000]  all of a sudden
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.920]  What about a UI?
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:31:01.520]  For an Apple TV or what about a UI for some wearable device or you know?
[01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:04.280]  Things don't necessarily have to be
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:12.320]  That magic, you know 320 or 640 with or that magic 11
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:15.480]  God, I always forget what it is
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:20.880]  1156 no 11 36 11 36, you know how I remember it. I remember it
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:27.040]  by the the classic George Lucas movie THX 11 38
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:30.960]  To us it's too it's too last
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:35.360]  Why couldn't they have made it a little and I that's what I always lament is why didn't they make it 11 38?
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:40.680]  Cuz then it would have been awesome and there's always that's actually a good way to remember it. It's too last
[01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:46.080]  It's just spitefully too last which might be what 750 is if it's really 750
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:48.400]  It might be too less than the the much neater
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:50.000]  752
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:56.000]  But I always remember that right and there's all sorts of in-jokes like in Star Wars the cell block where Princess Leia is held
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000]  as cell block 1 1 3 8
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.400]  George Lucas's movies are filled with
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:04.480]  1 1 3 8
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:08.620]  It's it is it's his number right, but the iPhone is too off
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:13.960]  That's a good way to remember it. I want that you thank you. You know, it's the sick way
[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:17.560]  Yeah, thank you as the as that size gets obviated into
[01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:21.040]  Exactly for two weeks, I'll be happy
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:26.040]  Yeah
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:28.800]  So are you gonna go with the 4.7 or 5.5?
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:33.900]  That's this that's my big dilemma right now knowing and think and you know
[01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:38.160]  Do I want something that fits in my pocket better or do I want something that you know?
[01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:45.080]  It's my my huge fleshy palm better single most frequently asked question. I've gotten over them since I've published. Ah
[01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:49.380]  my answer is I'm gonna do my best to keep an open mind and
[01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:55.820]  You know assuming that I'm getting invited and I'm out at the event and get to see the devices
[01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:57.820]  You know withhold judgment until I see him
[01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:03.900]  But in advance, what do I expect I expect that I would I'll get the 4.7
[01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:09.140]  because my eyes are not bad enough that I want a device specifically to get it bigger and
[01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:16.420]  I've seen five. I've seen devices with 5.5 inch displays. There's a Nokia that I played with at the build conference
[01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:23.580]  And it's a really interesting device just as a geek just looking at it as a gadget it's really interesting
[01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:29.500]  But to me, but it does not seem like something I would want to carry around and in my pants all the time
[01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:35.220]  That's it just seems too big might fit your hand though. Like a normal iPhone. It fits most of our hands
[01:33:35.220 --> 01:33:41.220]  My pockets are the same size your pockets are the same size but your hands
[01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:46.160]  I feel like you could be like the hand model for it and make it look like it's like a normal size iPhone
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:48.740]  Actually, I can do that with an iPad mini. So, you know
[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:54.980]  It really is though, I'm telling you look I haven't seen a Nokia with a 5.5 inch screen
[01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:57.340]  It is exactly what you think though where?
[01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:05.100]  If they didn't tell you what the device was and they just say here's the thing and you maybe if you went back two or
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:10.500]  Three years before the big super phones became prominent and somebody said what do you think?
[01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:17.140]  This is a really huge phone or a really small tablet. I think you would be like both. I don't know
[01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:23.660]  Yeah, it's impossible to decide it is that big or if you prefer it's that small, you know
[01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:29.700]  And I think that is the secret to the demand for these things. It's people who want to do
[01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:37.060]  More work on the device they carry with them all the way, you know all the places and you know
[01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:40.880]  In a way that Tim Cook says he does. What does he say 80% of his work on an iPad?
[01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:47.380]  You know that if you really want to do a lot more of your work on the device that you carry your own your phone
[01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:52.780]  You I could see how you might want that. I really do. I'm all know that I yeah
[01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:57.740]  I'm always curious to watch my wife's reaction to these things cuz
[01:34:57.740 --> 01:35:01.720]  she does not react to the
[01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:08.840]  These changes the way that I react to him. I mean she forget when the iPad mini first
[01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:14.320]  Not iPad iPod mini first came out. She was like, oh I gotta go get one of those
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:20.800]  What it's smaller. It's got less storage spaces, but it fits better in my purse, right?
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:25.680]  All right, okay different point of view
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:32.800]  She does a lot of work on her iPhone now. She does even she's doing email all the time. You know, it's like she she that's
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:42.840]  Almost to a detriment that she's on that thing a lot and I could see her wanting the larger one just because it's
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:45.800]  Not as big as her iPad
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:49.240]  But it lets her you know, write longer messages
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:52.960]  Presumably gonna be more comfortable to type on you know
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:59.040]  If it can have a split keyboard or is it gonna have it and you know iPhone esque keyboard?
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:03.400]  I wonder like when you're in in landscape mode. Yeah. Yeah have a split
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:08.200]  I I think about email and I think about how you know, it's long proven
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:16.740]  By usability studies and you know either bigger display like on your desktop bigger displays or dual displays that having more
[01:36:16.740 --> 01:36:23.660]  Desktop in front of you makes you more productive because you see, you know, we're you know
[01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:29.000]  Not to get all Syracuse here, but we're you know, our minds most of our minds for most people were we're spatially
[01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:37.500]  Our minds think spatially and we think like my emails over here my web browser is over here
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:42.660]  And if you could see them both at once while you're writing an email referring to a web page
[01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:48.200]  Your brain works better than if you have to keep to command tabbing between the two because they overlap
[01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:54.860]  And just as a little thing, but I find like when I'm reading I email on my iPad
[01:36:54.860 --> 01:37:01.960]  I always turn the screen to landscape so I can see the list of messages and see the selected message at the same time
[01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:08.020]  Being able to do that on an iPhone if they do the iPhone mail on the big phone
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:11.740]  like they did in that demo at WWDC where they
[01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:17.380]  You know show to two pains at once that could be a huge productivity thing
[01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:21.660]  I really I mean for somebody who if there's you know business people or people who for their work
[01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:26.860]  Do you know dozens and dozens of emails a day on their phone?
[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:29.920]  Having a device where you can see the list of your you know
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:34.100]  You see your inbox and the selected message at the same time. I don't think that's a little thing
[01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:37.620]  I think that's a big thing or even just replying to a message, right?
[01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:42.700]  Which is a lot of what I see my wife doing is she's scrolling up and down, right?
[01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:46.460]  She's gonna scroll down into the message to get the context for her reply
[01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:51.580]  Which is at the top of the message right and constantly move back. Well if the screens bigger
[01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:56.420]  You know, you can see the bottom part of the message and you can see the top part of the message
[01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:58.660]  And you don't have to do all that scrolling back and forth
[01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:02.660]  I mean it really I think the larger screen is gonna be more productive
[01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:06.100]  Right for the board not having to scroll at all in the first place, right?
[01:38:06.100 --> 01:38:11.960]  Yeah, like the message and your you know, I don't know 300 word email to me
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:14.140]  I see the whole thing without having to scroll at all
[01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:17.860]  Even though scrolling on the phone is so easy because your thumb is right there and you just do it
[01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:24.740]  you know if you're moving through 20 new emails and you want to do it before, you know your
[01:38:26.140 --> 01:38:30.460]  Bus shows up or whatever your what, you know, your train shows up that you're waiting for and here it comes
[01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:32.820]  You know, it makes you feel more efficient
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:38.720]  Yeah, I think it's gonna be insanely popular. I think I think my guess is there's probably gonna be like a waiting list for the
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:41.860]  5.5 and the 4.7 might be a little bit more available
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:46.380]  Well, you know according to Ben Thompson, you know, it's like all his
[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:49.380]  yeah, a lot of
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:55.940]  He's the guy he lives in in Taiwan pay. Yeah, Taiwan and
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:00.940]  Supposedly all his
[01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:07.260]  wife and her friends have all gotten these big Android devices and they're
[01:39:08.140 --> 01:39:15.260]  Really looking forward to this new larger iPhone coming out so they can ditch the Android device and get it back on the iPhone
[01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:18.420]  Because they need that large screen, right?
[01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:26.040]  I you know, maybe that made it maybe that is perceived need but probably not it's probably they have a good reason for wanting
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:28.040]  these larger screens
[01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:30.060]  You know, I personally
[01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:32.060]  I
[01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:34.620]  I'm not gonna I mean
[01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:40.380]  Part of me wants to get the larger screen just because it's you know, it's a developer. It's the new thing
[01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:42.380]  It's kind of the oddball
[01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:47.380]  It's about but both the 4.7 and the 5.5 or an oddball
[01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:54.500]  I'm not sure. I'm gonna want that that larger thing in my pocket. It's really that comes down to that
[01:39:54.500 --> 01:40:00.980]  I mean, I've got an iPad that I use in the evening, you know, I love my iPad mini and you know
[01:40:00.980 --> 01:40:05.340]  What's the difference between an iPad mini and a 5.5 inch?
[01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:11.180]  iPhone yeah, I think I think it's you know, and I've seen people who've you know
[01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:18.060]  It's all true. It's all trade-offs though. Everything is yeah, and I know some of that skepticism that Apple, you know
[01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:24.080]  There's still people even with all the rumors that there's still people who are skeptical that Apple would do a 5.5 inch iPhone
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:28.780]  Just on general principle and one of the arguments is it'll cannibalize sales of the iPad mini
[01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:33.300]  I think that's absolutely true, but I don't think it's true that it would keep Apple from doing it
[01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:39.620]  I think that you know, they want to have a continuum of device sizes that whatever your
[01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:42.420]  Perceived need is that you meet?
[01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:47.580]  You know that you have something to buy if you want to buy an iPhone and an iPad mini great
[01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:50.420]  They're apples twice as happy than if you just bought one device
[01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:55.060]  but if you really just want to buy one device they're sure as shit way happier if you buy a
[01:40:55.380 --> 01:41:00.220]  5.5 inch iPhone and only a 5.5 inch iPhone than if you buy a Samsung Galaxy Note
[01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:06.460]  Right, exactly, you know and I think Apple, you know as has had that mindset
[01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:13.360]  All along in that, you know the post next era, you know under Steve Jobs under Tim Cook
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:16.140]  I think the whole company has been you know
[01:41:16.140 --> 01:41:21.180]  Unafraid to cannibalize itself so as not to be cannibalized by an opponent
[01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:26.940]  You know, right. It's the same way. It goes back to the iPod mini right in the iPod nano
[01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:33.140]  All right, and it's and the the way that Steve Jobs called the original iPhone the best iPod we've ever made
[01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:36.940]  Right right there on stage. You said this is the best iPod we've ever made now
[01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:39.220]  I think it's arguable and there are a lot of people who are like I
[01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:45.100]  Actually kind of like my iPod for just for listening to music but they went the other way if anything they bragged about how?
[01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:46.540]  You know, you don't need an iPod
[01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:52.620]  You just have this phone that has everything when at a time when the iPod was the majority of the company's revenue and profits
[01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:53.900]  You know
[01:41:53.900 --> 01:41:55.660]  Whereas I think the traditional way
[01:41:55.660 --> 01:42:03.460]  That a company would be is the iPod division would have such political sway within the company that they would block the oh, yeah
[01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:08.500]  Political bullshit going on. Yeah, they would say well you can't play music
[01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:13.740]  You have to like tether your iPod to your phone to play music through or some, you know crazy thing like that
[01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:16.980]  That's the way tech companies typically worked, you know
[01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:21.660]  And still work is somebody would you know would block it like in a way that the crazy?
[01:42:21.820 --> 01:42:25.500]  Contortions that Microsoft still goes through to put windows on everything
[01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:29.220]  You know that the iPod division would have somehow, you know
[01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:35.180]  Let me ask you another question. Do you think there will be an iPod touch with these new dimensions? Oh
[01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:41.940]  Let's come back to that. I'm gonna do that. I have one more sponsor and ask that ask me that in in two minutes
[01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:47.580]  Okay, I want to thank our good friends another recurring sponsor a longtime friend of the show hover
[01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:54.820]  HOV ER best domain registrar in the world. I was listening to ATP last week and Marco said
[01:42:55.540 --> 01:43:00.740]  That he gets complaints every week about the way he pronounces their name and he says exactly like I do
[01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:04.940]  I think hover and it's like I'm the king of mispronouncing words on a podcast
[01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:11.100]  I have no idea how else you could pronounce HOV ER HOV ER like what a helicopter does
[01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:13.100]  who bear
[01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:19.340]  Oh, I don't know. I'm actually at a loss. I can't wait. I don't know if there's a new episode yet
[01:43:19.340 --> 01:43:24.940]  I'm hoping that there's follow-up on ATP because he asked for somebody to explain how else you could pronounce it. But anyway
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:28.980]  Just in case anybody is confused. It's HOV ER
[01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:32.100]  They are a great and long-standing
[01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:40.280]  domain registrar talk about a business that the domain registration makes the mattress business look like a
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:44.320]  Charity
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:50.420]  This is the typically the scum of the earth. I mean, they'll they'll steal your money. They'll swindle you
[01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:55.360]  I think that is a lot of crooked domain registrars out there that if you start searching for domain names on their site
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:44:00.360]  They like registering behind your back to sell them to you at a higher price. I don't trust them as far as I can throw
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:02.360]  them hover is the other way around
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:05.360]  really great
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:07.720]  everything customer service
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:11.860]  their interface their options their prices
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:20.320]  They've got all of the new top-level domains that you could possibly want if you want, you know dot guru or dot
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:26.840]  Plumber or whatever the hell else is available anything you could want hovers got it and
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:32.780]  Because you know if you're like me, you've got two main names registered from 10-15 years ago
[01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:37.600]  And you did it all over the internet with no really rhyme or reason or long-term thinking
[01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:42.040]  They've got this amazing thing you sign up for hover and it's called
[01:44:43.740 --> 01:44:48.980]  Valet service you just talk to them you say look I've got these domains at this other company
[01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:53.860]  whatever it is give your login to the other company to your rep at hover and
[01:44:53.860 --> 01:44:58.980]  They'll go through all of the stuff to move your DNS and set up
[01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:03.220]  Valet transfer service. It's completely painless and they do it for free
[01:45:03.220 --> 01:45:07.460]  They take care of the whole process for you because they know this is why they do it you think well
[01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:08.980]  That's too good to be true
[01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:11.020]  Hit the total pain in the butt today
[01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:16.580]  It's a huge pain in the ass, but they do it their valet transfer experts do it all the time
[01:45:17.100 --> 01:45:22.540]  They that's all they specialize in so they know DNS and screwing up your DNS. Ah, it's the worst
[01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:27.900]  I've yeah or even just are you having it how to initiate the transfers between the yeah
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:31.680]  It's it's in every domain registrar has a little bit different process
[01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:37.500]  It's yeah, they call it a lock or they call it a whatever cover knows how to handle this way
[01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:41.220]  Honestly that alone that that is is the best thing that they have
[01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:46.400]  Totally personal totally professional really really cool customer service
[01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:50.060]  If you don't already have your own domain name, you can get a domain name
[01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:52.940]  Then you have your own email address. You can have it for the rest of your life
[01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:57.420]  And instead of having a stupid at Gmail or whatever email address get your own domain name

[01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:07.980]  They even have email forwarding. It's just five bucks and then you can just use your same

[01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:02.500]  So my thanks to them
[01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:05.340]  Alright, what was your question again?
[01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:07.580]  You know, I press touch
[01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:11.540]  That's a great point five. So I
[01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:17.660]  I was just thinking about this looking at some of these product links that have come out or leaks
[01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:22.980]  You know the new iPhones and what they look like and how they kind of look like the the form factor of the current
[01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:25.060]  iPads
[01:47:25.060 --> 01:47:30.620]  Last year there were no new iPod touches. It's the the ones if you went to the Apple store today
[01:47:30.620 --> 01:47:33.980]  They're effectively the same ones that have been on sale for two years. Yeah
[01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:40.860]  Yeah, the previous generation was the same way where they've got it seems like now for four years
[01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:43.200]  They've had the iPod touch on a two-year cycle
[01:47:44.060 --> 01:47:48.800]  So if that stays the same there will be new ones this year, but there have been no rumors about it
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:56.300]  That doesn't prove anything, but who knows but the thing I remember is at the event the Apple event where the iPhone 5
[01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:58.460]  was announced
[01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:04.580]  And they said okay, you know, it was a press event there I thank you very much, you know
[01:48:04.580 --> 01:48:08.500]  There's a room over there you guys if you anybody want to have a hands-on you go over him
[01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:11.540]  and so I went over there and I was with MG Siegler and
[01:48:12.460 --> 01:48:16.580]  Everybody made a bum rush for the phones and the iPhones and I wanted to see him, too
[01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:22.940]  But the iPod touch the new iPod touches were there too and it was the table they were on was far less crowded
[01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:25.340]  so MG and I went over there and we were looking at the
[01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:27.580]  at the
[01:48:27.580 --> 01:48:30.660]  At the iPods we did we played with the phone for a little bit
[01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:33.020]  But we you know left to the side because it was just too crowded
[01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:37.260]  we go over and look at the iPods and they were so amazingly thin it was like
[01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:38.580]  I
[01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:41.060]  I just can't believe how thin this is
[01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:46.200]  I know I I've only spent a grand total of like 20 seconds with the new iPhone 5 and I'm already
[01:48:46.540 --> 01:48:49.980]  Kind of more impressed by this device because it's so much thinner
[01:48:50.620 --> 01:48:51.620]  and
[01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:54.540]  the iPhone 5 and the 5s are
[01:48:55.020 --> 01:49:00.740]  About as thin as the two generation ago iPod touch like pretty much throughout
[01:49:00.740 --> 01:49:08.860]  Pretty much for the entire life of the iPhone the iPod touch has been a generation ahead in terms of how thin
[01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:13.780]  The next one is going to be if there is one it would be amazingly thin
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:19.020]  Hey, this is Dave cutting in to let you know that Craig's audio is about to go haywire here in a minute
[01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:20.140]  I don't know what happened
[01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:23.420]  Maybe he had a wrong button or like nine wrong buttons
[01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:27.380]  But it only goes that way for a minute or so and then it goes back to normal. So don't freak out
[01:49:27.380 --> 01:49:31.140]  Also, this cut in was brought to you by Squarespace. So I don't know
[01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:33.860]  I don't know what to expect though because and it's you know
[01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:44.180]  No, I don't either
[01:49:49.020 --> 01:49:52.740]  You know, it's seven great big winning games
[01:49:52.740 --> 01:49:54.740]  It'll be
[01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:57.700]  Awesome awesome music
[01:49:59.620 --> 01:50:01.620]  Great great
[01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:06.500]  Like it, you know
[01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:18.180]  We didn't go ahead with that one seven seven there would make sense it's kind of like the 1136 640s just to get it to get it located
[01:50:21.980 --> 01:50:23.980]  That they were probably the
[01:50:23.980 --> 01:50:29.820]  The size is a multiple round or the the the lower end
[01:50:33.980 --> 01:50:35.980]  5c
[01:50:36.540 --> 01:50:38.540]  6 6. Yeah
[01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:43.300]  But I don't think since you know, it's gonna be CC
[01:50:45.860 --> 01:50:47.860]  5c
[01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:51.340]  So I have no
[01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:53.380]  I
[01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:59.540]  Don't know what I'm so terrible of all the things I I can predict predicting names
[01:50:59.540 --> 01:51:03.780]  I'm never right, so I'm not even gonna bother if I had to guess though, it would be
[01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:07.980]  Something like iPhone 6 and iPhone 6l
[01:51:08.420 --> 01:51:14.100]  but I honestly don't know where the 6 would be the 4.7 inch one and it's defined as being the
[01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:17.180]  that's like the standard iPhone 6 and
[01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:23.900]  The iPhone the big one the 5.5. One is the one that you know, I know people have tossed around the name. I
[01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:26.300]  iPhone air
[01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:28.780]  That doesn't make sense to me though for either one. I don't know
[01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:32.620]  maybe the 4.7 would be called the air I don't know but
[01:51:34.140 --> 01:51:36.420]  The baby basically there's gonna be
[01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:40.060]  5.5
[01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:42.580]  a orange
[01:51:42.580 --> 01:51:44.180]  And
[01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:45.980]  That's probably it
[01:51:45.980 --> 01:51:48.500]  here's why I don't think that there will be a
[01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:52.420]  5.5 inch iPod touch is that I think
[01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:59.940]  As I've said, I think the 5.5 inch iPhone is gonna go triple retina, and I don't think the 4.7 will
[01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:04.680]  And we can I should talk about that too because that's part of the follow-up
[01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:08.380]  I you know, a lot of people are pushing me back on that maybe be the last point but
[01:52:08.380 --> 01:52:15.540]  They're gonna I think they're gonna charge at least an extra hundred bucks for the same size for the 5.5
[01:52:15.660 --> 01:52:19.300]  But that's for the most of the markets where the iPhone is strongest
[01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:24.580]  It's subsidized pricing where you buy your iPhone with a two-year contract and the real price is hidden
[01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:29.820]  That's gonna be a super expensive screen. It's gonna be a super expensive battery
[01:52:30.380 --> 01:52:32.380]  Everything's gonna be more expensive than that
[01:52:32.380 --> 01:52:39.080]  And I'm already spending you're always spending a couple hundred dollars to get the iPhone upgrade. Anyway another hundred dollars
[01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:42.340]  It's like there's no care is gonna cost another hundred dollars
[01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:49.980]  You can't hide the price of that with the iPod touch because the iPod touch isn't so right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, right
[01:52:50.220 --> 01:52:55.900]  So the iPod touch if there's a new one, I think it's gonna have the 4.7 inch screen. Yeah, and the same
[01:52:55.900 --> 01:53:02.780]  Three hundred twenty six pixel per inch that the iPod touch already has right. It's just gonna be a little bit bigger
[01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:04.780]  And I think it's way more feasible
[01:53:05.100 --> 01:53:11.140]  To you know sell it at the same price points that we're used to selling the iPod touch at and look at what the iPod
[01:53:11.140 --> 01:53:14.220]  Touch is mainly used for it's music games
[01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:17.900]  Radio and videos. Yeah, and that's all
[01:53:18.820 --> 01:53:21.300]  You know, it's not a productivity thing, right?
[01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:27.420]  Right, you know you the teenager who's getting an iPod touch for Christmas is not thinking. Oh, yeah, cool
[01:53:27.420 --> 01:53:29.420]  I can run Microsoft Word on this now
[01:53:30.700 --> 01:53:32.700]  Thinking oh, yeah
[01:53:33.060 --> 01:53:35.300]  Candy crush or whatever that yeah
[01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:41.820]  Yeah, and so the last thing and this is a big push right and there's a super frequently
[01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:44.900]  asked response to my
[01:53:45.100 --> 01:53:47.100]  during fireball piece over the weekend is
[01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:53.740]  How in the world, you know, why in the world would Apple to go 3x on one the 5.5 and 2x
[01:53:53.740 --> 01:53:56.180]  Stay at 2x on the 4.7
[01:53:56.180 --> 01:54:01.140]  They're either gonna do 2x on both or they're gonna go 3x on both and there's no way they would do it any other way
[01:54:03.420 --> 01:54:04.860]  And there's a certain logic to that
[01:54:04.860 --> 01:54:08.860]  But the more I think about it the more I think if they're gonna charge more for the big one
[01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:15.100]  they need to it needs to be more technically impressive not just physically bigger and
[01:54:15.100 --> 01:54:22.260]  And I think there's a very serious battery life issue with that where
[01:54:23.660 --> 01:54:28.220]  And I'll put it in the show notes if I can remember but there's a there was a good piece at a non tech
[01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:36.340]  About the the push towards super high resolutions and phones going from the 300 and some DPI range to 400 and some DPI
[01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:43.100]  Because there's some other phones, you know, there's some HTC phones with 450 460 pixels prints and
[01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:48.620]  And according to them and I you know, I trust a non tech it takes going at the same size
[01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:50.700]  going from around
[01:54:50.700 --> 01:54:57.760]  350 to 450 pixels per inch comes with a 20% penalty in energy consumption just for the display
[01:54:58.180 --> 01:55:03.120]  Yeah, well for the number of pixels right at the same side. You're lighting up more transistors
[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:09.700]  Yeah, right not talking about the increase in size, but just the increase in transistors for the number of pixels is about a 20%
[01:55:09.700 --> 01:55:11.700]  A
[01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:14.020]  Penalty the
[01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:20.260]  5.5 according to all the component leaks the 5.5 inch iPhone has a 60% bigger battery
[01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:26.620]  So it's the battery is more than bigger enough to compensate for the 20% penalty
[01:55:26.700 --> 01:55:31.720]  Whereas a 4.7 inch iPhone just doesn't have room for a much bigger battery than the 4.0 inch iPhone
[01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:38.580]  So I think a energy consumption and be that $100 price difference that I think they're going to charge that they can
[01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:45.660]  You know the 5.5 can still hit the iPhone size margins and the 4.7 couldn't at least not this year
[01:55:45.660 --> 01:55:51.540]  And then that leaves room in the future for either next year or the year after that for a 3x retina
[01:55:51.820 --> 01:55:53.740]  4.7 iPhone
[01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:57.460]  but I don't think it's gonna I think the reason it won't happen this year is price and
[01:55:57.980 --> 01:56:04.500]  Energy consumption and the size of the battery that they can put in the phone. Yeah, that's the other thing productivity wise
[01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:10.500]  Yeah productivity wise that might drive people towards the 5.5 is I wouldn't be surprised
[01:56:10.620 --> 01:56:16.620]  If when they say here's your expected battery life if the 5.5 is just a preposterous number
[01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:21.580]  You know that it goes from I don't know 12 hours of use to 20 hours of use or something like that
[01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:29.360]  But could it really I mean if it's driving that bigger that much bigger because I think and and you know
[01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:31.360]  They're gonna want to keep it thin
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:37.920]  Okay, you know, yeah, you have a little bit more X and Y but you got no more Z. I don't know
[01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:39.920]  yeah, I agree with you on the Z it but
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:46.040]  You know, I don't know. I just wouldn't be surprised if if they put it up and it has just a
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:50.360]  seemingly, you know at least compared to the other model iPhone a
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:53.700]  huge jump in daily battery life
[01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:58.460]  Maybe not. Maybe it'll you know, maybe you're right and it'll you know
[01:56:58.460 --> 01:57:04.020]  Be they'll be more or less equivalent. But yeah, I think there'll be anything else other than
[01:57:05.180 --> 01:57:07.180]  display sizes I
[01:57:07.220 --> 01:57:10.900]  Don't think I don't think I don't see there being anything like a touch ID
[01:57:11.100 --> 01:57:16.020]  Or speed bumps or anything to separate the two or anything new anything new?
[01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:18.500]  I think this is gonna be all about display sizes
[01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:24.060]  It's like the jump between the you know, the 4s and the 5 in my mind. It's it's
[01:57:24.060 --> 01:57:30.140]  You know the this we're on that cycle where okay. It's all about the display this time
[01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:32.560]  It's you know
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:34.560]  You know, there may be something new
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:42.520]  with a success, you know in a year's time or something like that, but I think it's it there they're gonna be
[01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:48.360]  Yeah, these displays are gonna be impressive. They're gonna be impressive and
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:54.120]  That's the thing that Apple's gonna go. Hey, look at this
[01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:57.240]  it
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:02.800]  It's gonna be great though because the basically touch ID is gonna be across the line now, right, you know, yeah
[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:10.840]  It'll you know some some 5c equivalent thing is gonna have touch ID now. It's it's I
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:15.880]  Think here's how I think the lineup will look I think the lineup will be
[01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:20.200]  The top price is the 5.5 inch iPhone, right?
[01:58:21.340 --> 01:58:29.320]  $100 less for the same amount of storage the new 4.7. I think other than the display everything about those two phones will be the same
[01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:30.960]  I think they'll have the same
[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:36.000]  Better than ever camera and you'll have the same touch ID. I think if they add
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:40.840]  Anything new to the m8 motion?
[01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:47.800]  Cog co-processor if there's an m9, you know that has even more health tracking stuff. They'll both get the same thing
[01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:54.680]  If there are any kind of technical improvements to the fingerprint scanner, I think they'll both get the exact same
[01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:58.920]  Improvement everything other than the display I think will be the same
[01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:03.760]  I think they'll have the same a what are they up to a 8 CPU system on a chip?
[01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:05.760]  Do you think they'll go with a new CPU?
[01:59:05.980 --> 01:59:09.560]  Yeah, I think so. They got that 4.7
[01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:10.800]  or
[01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:12.800]  Excuse me a 7 this is
[01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:19.680]  It is pretty good. And you know, somebody has said something about you know, what it caught about the GPU being able to handle the
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:27.720]  22 by 12 whatever again. Yeah, I can drive an iPad mini. I mean, yeah, and then I was a great job with it
[01:59:27.720 --> 01:59:30.500]  Yeah, and and that actually has more total pixels
[01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:34.040]  Yeah, because it's only 2048 in the larger dimension
[01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:40.120]  but because the the wide dimension because it's four to three if you multiply it's like over three million pixels and
[01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:42.240]  And this is one of those
[01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:44.840]  It's all about the display
[01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:48.560]  Cycles, it's not about the CPU. No, though. I don't know
[01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:54.680]  I just feel though that they're on I feel like that they're their chip group is on a tear
[01:59:54.680 --> 01:59:56.200]  Oh, yeah, they're there on fire
[01:59:56.200 --> 02:00:01.520]  But I don't think they need to I think they will just because their chip group is on fire and it's almost like
[02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:07.200]  Right topic for a separate show is that whole topic of are they ever gonna have one that that's you know?
[02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:11.000]  speed compatible with like a low-end Intel chip, yeah, it's
[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:19.040]  I don't think it's astounding to me that the improvements that the the CPUs have seen. Yeah, I just don't think they'll take a
[02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:24.160]  I don't think they'll take a year off on that because I think that they're like firing on all cylinders and that they
[02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:28.800]  You know effectively at the same price that they made the a7 last year
[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:31.960]  They can make an even better a8 and they're not going to take a year off
[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:37.180]  Yeah, that's what I don't look at look at how many Android devices are running with a 64-bit processor right now
[02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:40.320]  cricket strip
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:43.600]  So let's so let's list them out
[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:51.080]  All right, we're done with that exhaustive list
[02:00:53.060 --> 02:00:57.680]  No, I think that the two new iPhones will be at the top $100 apart in price
[02:00:57.680 --> 02:01:01.400]  Anything that the one has the other will have except for the super display
[02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:04.760]  I think that the 5s
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:08.640]  Stays around for another year and they do that
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:15.360]  they go back to what they used to do and the 5s drops a hundred dollars in price and takes the mid tier and
[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:22.840]  I think the 5c stays around and becomes the free with contract phone as is without any changes
[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:23.840]  I don't think I think so
[02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:28.120]  I think touch ID moves down a tier because of the 5s moves down a tier but I
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:30.760]  Don't think it moves all the way down to the bottom. I
[02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:33.660]  Think it'll be another year before it does
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:40.360]  That's my guess and I don't think there's gonna be a 6c. I don't think there's gonna be a new plastic, you know phone
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:45.440]  I think that the new if you want a bigger iPhone, you have to buy the new you have to buy at the top of the
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:46.440]  line
[02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:47.960]  will be
[02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:55.040]  another potential scenario is to take the current 5s and fit it into the
[02:01:56.040 --> 02:02:01.520]  5c right like a 5 5 CS that has touch ID in an a8
[02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:05.240]  You know, it's like a
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:12.480]  Apple like simplified product lines, right, you know that that was the whole thing Steve Jobs brought back to Apple, right?
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:19.820]  It's like, you know that simple for product matrix, you know pro consumer desktop laptop and you know that you know
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.100]  Us talking about well, okay. Let's have
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:24.840]  four different models of iPhone
[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:28.160]  Do you really need four different models of iPhone? I
[02:02:29.060 --> 02:02:33.380]  Mean, yeah, but they've they do they do like to have that free phone
[02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:36.700]  Right. Yeah, and I'm sure that they that
[02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:40.720]  For certain people that's an important thing, right?
[02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:43.560]  It's like they all this phone is free
[02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:51.720]  My monthly bill to the carrier, right? Here's what I wrote two years ago
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:56.440]  And this was in response to a guy I actually got in there and responded to him
[02:02:56.440 --> 02:03:00.680]  But it was a guy on Hacker News who after I put my piece up who said, okay
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:02.280]  I'm not trying to be a dick here
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:04.320]  Which is always a good sign that you're trying to be a dick
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:08.880]  But every time I see the rumor about the screen size of the iPhone 6 it always remind me
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:15.640]  How Gruber and Jim Dalrymple two of the biggest Apple fans on the internet mock the screen size of Samsung note before?
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:23.360]  And I do I definitely cracked some jokes about using those big-ass phones as phones and I think the iPhone
[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:26.800]  5.5 is gonna look ridiculous if you hold it up to your ear and use it as a phone
[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:29.880]  But here's what I wrote two years ago when the iPhone 5 shipped
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:36.920]  I wrote there's no argument that some people really do like these big closer to five than four inch Android and Windows phones
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:40.160]  I was in a Verizon retail store yesterday long story
[02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:46.960]  Don't ask why and overheard a relatively small woman buying a Samsung Galaxy s3 and that was a big that was a 5-inch phone
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:48.960]  a
[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:55.560]  companion asked her if she wasn't worried that it was too big and she said no big was exactly what she wanted because she doesn't
[02:03:55.560 --> 02:03:57.720]  Have a tablet and wanted to do a lot of reading on
[02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:04.240]  Whatever phone she got and she even said she was thinking about the bigger Galaxy note
[02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:07.240]  But Verizon didn't carry it and she wanted to stay on Verizon
[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:14.440]  It was like like a conversation out of a Samsung commercial such people surely think the iPhone fives
[02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:17.280]  Four inch display remains too small
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:18.040]  But trust me
[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:24.040]  There's going to be many longtime iPhone users complaining that it's too big after they upgrade because that was me talking about how hard it
[02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:26.040]  Was to reach the corner with one hand
[02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:28.520]  So here's what I said in an ideal world
[02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:34.840]  perhaps Apple would offer to iPhone sizes like they do with products like MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs a
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:43.440]  Smaller one with the classic 3.5 inch display and a larger one with say a 4.5 inch display for people who want that
[02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:46.920]  So I think I've been on on on
[02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:51.300]  The team of hey, they should have two sized iPhones a bigger one and a smaller one
[02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:56.740]  For a while, but I think I under did one thing I underestimated was just how much bigger
[02:04:56.740 --> 02:05:04.580]  Phones could and would and demand would show that they get that my idea that they'd stick with the 3.5 inch and maybe add a
[02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:06.100]  4.5
[02:05:06.100 --> 02:05:07.500]  Wasn't enough. Yeah
[02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:15.380]  Well, the other thing to think about too is people's habits as far as using the quote-unquote phone have changed, right? I
[02:05:16.460 --> 02:05:19.100]  See a lot of people talking on their phone
[02:05:19.100 --> 02:05:26.300]  In ways that where the phone is not up to their ear, right? Yeah talking through your headset
[02:05:26.820 --> 02:05:29.260]  Talking to the speakerphone. Yeah, it's
[02:05:30.300 --> 02:05:32.940]  Yes, it looks ridiculous when you hold it up to your ear
[02:05:33.820 --> 02:05:35.340]  but I
[02:05:35.340 --> 02:05:41.100]  Mean I look at my wife. She does conference calls all the time and she's guy, you know her, you know
[02:05:41.260 --> 02:05:47.700]  The earbuds in and it's you know, the phones are sitting there on the desk. Yeah, I think it's a leg
[02:05:47.700 --> 02:05:50.980]  It's a legacy from the old telephone system that we think of
[02:05:50.980 --> 02:05:55.700]  you know that that guys and you still think of a phone is something you hold up to your ear right into your man and
[02:05:55.820 --> 02:06:01.340]  It's convenient to do that sometimes right, you know, if you you're out and about and you got a phone call
[02:06:01.340 --> 02:06:07.340]  You know, you hold it up to your and you talk and you know, it's a you know, it's literally a five-minute conversation
[02:06:07.340 --> 02:06:08.940]  I I don't
[02:06:08.940 --> 02:06:13.780]  Yeah, I don't talk, you know, you'd say that you know, you have to call these people
[02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:16.540]  What I?
[02:06:16.540 --> 02:06:20.780]  just want to talk to people over chat or email or
[02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:23.300]  social networks and
[02:06:23.380 --> 02:06:25.380]  You know, I still love having
[02:06:26.180 --> 02:06:28.180]  conversations in person
[02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:30.180]  You know like we're having now, right?
[02:06:30.940 --> 02:06:37.060]  That's still an important thing. But you know long converse phone conversations
[02:06:38.020 --> 02:06:44.780]  Don't do that very often. No almost never and I just don't think it's a reason. It's not a it's no longer a reason to
[02:06:44.780 --> 02:06:49.140]  To dictate the size of the hardware. Yeah. No, no
[02:06:50.460 --> 02:06:52.460]  right, and it's you know, I
[02:06:52.700 --> 02:06:54.700]  think it's very similar to
[02:06:54.780 --> 02:06:59.580]  Using a tablet no matter how big your tablet is as a camera, you know
[02:06:59.580 --> 02:07:03.500]  It does I still think it looks silly but I don't make fun of it anymore because it's too many
[02:07:03.500 --> 02:07:05.620]  I've seen too many hundreds of people doing it
[02:07:06.460 --> 02:07:12.500]  Well, look at the camera that Ansel Adam used. All right. Well, but he wasn't format film, right? It's
[02:07:13.100 --> 02:07:14.540]  it's
[02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:19.740]  A lot of people like it that was because you know Ansel Adams did it because it was technically to get the incredibly
[02:07:19.740 --> 02:07:22.380]  Yeah, you know there was a yeah, you know
[02:07:22.900 --> 02:07:28.460]  It would be different if the iPad had a huge sensor like a foreign if it had a four-inch image sensor
[02:07:28.580 --> 02:07:33.300]  Yeah, I was taking you'd be doing it even. Yeah, I would be doing it, too
[02:07:33.860 --> 02:07:39.100]  It's actually got a crummy sensor. No, it's just got a big screen. But you know, but it's too many people do it
[02:07:39.100 --> 02:07:42.140]  It's you know, it was worth a couple of laughs for a year or so
[02:07:42.140 --> 02:07:48.500]  But now that's you know, that's most people that's a lot of people's main camera. So, you know, yeah time to move on
[02:07:48.500 --> 02:07:54.040]  I see it all the time, you know people taking pictures of the sunset and Laguna Beach and that's like
[02:07:54.780 --> 02:08:03.000]  Well number one there it cracks me up people take pictures of the sunset by pointing the camera on the iPad at the Sun
[02:08:03.420 --> 02:08:05.260]  it's like
[02:08:05.260 --> 02:08:09.740]  They're looking at this big-ass screen, which they can barely see because the Sun is in there. It's
[02:08:09.740 --> 02:08:16.240]  The one thing that still gets people people using an iPad as a camera is when they have a cover and they just let the
[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:20.060]  Cover hang below and so they've got a double double size
[02:08:21.100 --> 02:08:24.580]  Rectangle in front of their face. They got a dangle, right?
[02:08:25.260 --> 02:08:29.580]  It's like at least fold the screen up, right? It's like, you know it accordions up
[02:08:29.580 --> 02:08:32.020]  You can hold it at the bottom of the phone and it won't cover the lens
[02:08:32.020 --> 02:08:36.780]  It's like at least fold that up. Yeah, that actually makes it a little bit thicker and easier to hold
[02:08:36.780 --> 02:08:42.100]  It's yeah, well, it almost looks like they're like they're in the witness protection and they're like hiding
[02:08:42.420 --> 02:08:47.540]  Yeah, but you know as developers we learn that that people are gonna do what they're gonna do
[02:08:47.540 --> 02:08:50.180]  All right, and you just kind of adapt to that
[02:08:50.180 --> 02:08:55.460]  It's like you can't force people to do things that you'd think make more sense
[02:08:56.460 --> 02:08:59.740]  What do you think? What do you think you're gonna do for buying a new phone?
[02:09:00.460 --> 02:09:04.780]  You're on the fence. Do you do you think you would wait until you could see him in the store? So yeah
[02:09:04.780 --> 02:09:10.380]  No, I'm definitely gonna have to wait and see him in the store. I think that's gonna be a huge difference this year
[02:09:10.380 --> 02:09:13.820]  I was thinking about I think there's gonna be an awful lot of people who
[02:09:14.260 --> 02:09:16.900]  Otherwise would have if they only had one new iPhone
[02:09:17.020 --> 02:09:19.820]  They would just pre-order it so they could get it as soon as they can
[02:09:20.020 --> 02:09:22.660]  But they're not they're gonna wait till they can see it in stores
[02:09:22.900 --> 02:09:29.140]  So that they can make it an informed decision about which of the two they want to get the lines are gonna be insane
[02:09:30.140 --> 02:09:31.820]  Yeah, I do
[02:09:31.820 --> 02:09:33.780]  insane because
[02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:40.060]  so many people in the last cycle or the last couple cycles actually have
[02:09:41.820 --> 02:09:44.780]  Just gotten the device delivered by
[02:09:45.860 --> 02:09:51.500]  FedEx or whoever, you know drivers it in your area and but now people want to see it. Yeah
[02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:55.180]  And you know
[02:09:55.540 --> 02:10:00.940]  You're gonna be in a better position than the most people because you'll have actually seen it at the press event
[02:10:00.940 --> 02:10:05.980]  But all right possibly, you know, we get a review unit, but I you know knock on wood there
[02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:09.660]  I you know, I never find out until the day of so yeah
[02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:15.740]  But at the least I hope to see them both at the at the at the press event
[02:10:15.740 --> 02:10:20.660]  I think I'll get to four seven. It really is one of those things that yeah that I
[02:10:21.220 --> 02:10:26.500]  would lean now towards the 4.7 just begin again because I've got the iPad mini which is
[02:10:26.980 --> 02:10:29.700]  Suits my needs just fine and that you know
[02:10:29.700 --> 02:10:32.600]  After dinner, you know reading
[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:35.600]  You know something to do while
[02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:39.240]  commercials are playing on the TV or whatever, but
[02:10:40.140 --> 02:10:42.320]  Yeah, I mean, you know
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:48.400]  the 5.5 is actually more interesting from the user interface point of view because it it extends the
[02:10:49.320 --> 02:10:55.240]  Thumb targets, right? No, totally. It's right got it. It's it's it's a new I
[02:10:55.960 --> 02:10:57.640]  mean with the mini
[02:10:57.640 --> 02:11:04.760]  You know the iPad mini you you basically say, okay, you can't move your thumb from the lower left of the upper, right?
[02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:06.960]  I spent your right handed
[02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:13.400]  I spent like half my review of the iPhone 5 talking about how I couldn't reach the top corner with my thumb and that was
[02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:15.400]  a half inch difference this is
[02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:19.360]  Two inches different from the three point five inch original iPhone
[02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:24.600]  So, you know, it's part of me wants to to get that larger phone just to understand
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:26.600]  the
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:28.440]  ergonomics of
[02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:30.440]  the new device
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:37.400]  From a pretty packed practical point of view. It's like okay. I want something smaller to put in my pocket. So
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:43.280]  Yeah, it's a it's a yeah, you know, everybody's gonna have a similar kind of
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:45.760]  You know, well
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:48.560]  Choice a is good and choice B is good
[02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:54.640]  Well, maybe I should go with a maybe I should go with B maybe a B a B a B and you know
[02:11:56.160 --> 02:11:58.520]  You're gonna get there and in fact
[02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:04.440]  You know that the lines at the Apple Store are probably gonna move more slowly because people are choosing between A and B
[02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:09.000]  And not not knowing which one is right. I mean some people will go in and yeah
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.920]  Oh, you definitely want to be definitely I need the bigger one bigger
[02:12:11.920 --> 02:12:14.180]  I think and I think that the the fan droid
[02:12:14.180 --> 02:12:18.660]  Contingent they're gonna have a like an aneurysm on the basis of that
[02:12:18.660 --> 02:12:22.140]  Apple is going to market it as though they invented big-screen phones
[02:12:23.300 --> 02:12:28.460]  You know that they are they're gonna call it like revolutionary based on some sort of thing
[02:12:28.460 --> 02:12:33.380]  And and then the fender is gonna be like, you know, I've had the you know, a five inch galaxy
[02:12:33.900 --> 02:12:36.580]  Whatever for two and a half years, they're gonna go nuts
[02:12:36.580 --> 02:12:37.780]  But that's you know, yeah
[02:12:37.780 --> 02:12:44.620]  Apple is either way ahead or they take their time and they do it last and better. Yep
[02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:47.020]  They're they're doing it
[02:12:47.580 --> 02:12:49.500]  Doing it. Well
[02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:51.500]  rather than first
[02:12:51.860 --> 02:12:53.820]  Yeah in this case
[02:12:53.820 --> 02:12:59.220]  It was the one more thing. I wanted to I have one more point, but I forget it. Yeah, who cares?
[02:12:59.220 --> 02:13:02.820]  We've got long enough. Yeah, I need to pee. Yeah, I
[02:13:02.820 --> 02:13:07.940]  Can't even imagine how big your bladder is. Yeah, probably a lot of large
[02:13:09.780 --> 02:13:16.460]  Craig Hockenberry of the Aachen the icon factory people can follow you on Twitter at
[02:13:17.620 --> 02:13:23.060]  At chalk and berry, right? I haven't been tweeting much lately. I'm very busy with
[02:13:24.380 --> 02:13:26.380]  Yosemite and iOS hate stuff
[02:13:27.060 --> 02:13:31.060]  But yeah, that's where I am. Oh, I know what I wanted to say. I had one more
[02:13:31.060 --> 02:13:33.140]  Here's my one more thing. My one more thing is
[02:13:34.420 --> 02:13:39.860]  How do they fill up a 90-minute iPhone announcement? I don't think bigger screen is enough
[02:13:40.140 --> 02:13:44.260]  So I think I'm now of the opinion that there's two paths that they take
[02:13:44.620 --> 02:13:46.780]  One path is not just talking about bigger
[02:13:46.780 --> 02:13:52.220]  But what bigger enables and it would be you know, like a sort of a productivity keynote
[02:13:52.620 --> 02:13:57.860]  Right, like look at now look at email in landscape. You can see two things at once, you know
[02:13:57.860 --> 02:14:04.660]  That sort of thing and other apps that they've secretly updated to act differently on this bigger iPhone
[02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:08.660]  They could talk and they could talk for 30 minutes just about iOS extensions
[02:14:09.300 --> 02:14:12.020]  iOS extensions and the continuity and
[02:14:12.660 --> 02:14:14.500]  Thank you and guess what?
[02:14:14.500 --> 02:14:20.500]  You know iOS 8 and you somebody are gonna have to drop at the same time because of all of the you know, I cloud
[02:14:21.060 --> 02:14:23.060]  No, no cloud kit
[02:14:23.060 --> 02:14:28.340]  Cloud kit. Nope. I think it's gonna play out exactly like last year where remember
[02:14:30.460 --> 02:14:32.460]  iOS keychain and
[02:14:32.540 --> 02:14:34.540]  It wasn't in iOS 7
[02:14:35.660 --> 02:14:36.860]  0.0
[02:14:36.860 --> 02:14:41.020]  We had to wait till October. I think we wait till October for continuity. I
[02:14:41.900 --> 02:14:46.340]  think iOS 8 ships without continuity hooked up yet and that the
[02:14:46.340 --> 02:14:53.340]  The Yosemite will come out in October with the new iPads. Mm-hmm
[02:14:54.780 --> 02:14:58.580]  It's in its higher profile than just the iOS keychain
[02:14:58.580 --> 02:15:03.660]  but that's the reason keychain didn't ship till October is because it had to shit like you said it has to ship at the same
[02:15:03.660 --> 02:15:06.460]  Time the feature has to ship at the same time as Yosemite
[02:15:06.700 --> 02:15:10.980]  Because what's the point of having keychain syncing keychain syncing if you don't have anything to sync it to?
[02:15:10.980 --> 02:15:15.660]  You they're gonna be a lot of disappointed developers as it goes down that way
[02:15:16.340 --> 02:15:22.460]  If they wait an extra month, yeah, I mean the whole thing, you know about you know, I cloud is that it it
[02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:27.100]  You know binds your devices together, right? You've got I
[02:15:28.340 --> 02:15:34.500]  Don't think Yosemite ships next month. I think it ships in October and I think just like last year
[02:15:34.500 --> 02:15:38.060]  I think Mac. I think it's too much to ask that they ship to operating system. Yeah
[02:15:38.060 --> 02:15:45.620]  No, just from I get it from an engineering resources point of view and a testing point of view and a deployment point of view
[02:15:45.620 --> 02:15:47.620]  And but you know
[02:15:49.820 --> 02:15:52.860]  Are you you know, this this thing was like iCloud Drive, right?
[02:15:52.860 --> 02:15:56.940]  You're gonna be able to put things on iCloud Drive, but you're not gonna be able to get them on your your man
[02:15:56.940 --> 02:16:00.820]  I don't think you I don't think you were able to put them in iCloud Drive until until October
[02:16:00.820 --> 02:16:02.820]  I think you have to wait for like 8.01
[02:16:03.780 --> 02:16:05.780]  For all of the iCloud stuff
[02:16:05.780 --> 02:16:13.140]  That's my guess. I could be wrong. I don't know. That's just pure guess based on last year's iCloud the keychain thing
[02:16:15.820 --> 02:16:20.580]  So, how else do they fill up if I am right that they don't have all that if if if they do ship at the
[02:16:20.580 --> 02:16:22.580]  Same time then god, they'll be
[02:16:22.980 --> 02:16:28.640]  They'll be hard-pressed to finish within two hours, right? They finish it's gonna it's gonna be like the WWC keynote, right?
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:34.040]  It's like boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom, right? Right because take a breath
[02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:41.880]  Yeah, and and just think I mean they could fill up they could fill up 45 minutes just with demos from selected third
[02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:48.840]  Parties who've been in secretly locked up in Cupertino for the last three weeks building cool extensions, you know easily
[02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:52.440]  But I don't think I think that's more of an October thing
[02:16:52.440 --> 02:16:57.960]  I think that they either fill it up with productivity stuff that you can do with the new bigger screen or
[02:16:57.960 --> 02:17:04.040]  Health stuff that this is when they unveil I don't know if they'd unveil the device
[02:17:04.040 --> 02:17:09.520]  I mean, I sort of guessed that they would a couple weeks ago and people had it should fit but that you know
[02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:14.360]  The health kit stuff and what they're going to do and maybe if there is like a new
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:17.220]  even better m9 and the new phones
[02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:21.540]  This is where they explain the whole health initiative
[02:17:22.020 --> 02:17:26.560]  Because I don't think that the health stuff fits with an October event
[02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:33.360]  Where they have all this continuity stuff and Yosemite to explain like to me. That's my
[02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:36.440]  That's yeah
[02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:40.900]  What you're what you're what you're what you're basically saying is that
[02:17:41.840 --> 02:17:43.680]  the
[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:49.260]  September event is all about the iOS device stuff you can do on the iOS device productivity
[02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:52.200]  tracking your health and
[02:17:52.200 --> 02:17:59.440]  Then the October event is about how all your devices together. Yeah, right
[02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:03.320]  That's my guess and that may be you know
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:07.940]  If there's a big surprise, it would be that whatever the wearable dingus that's been rumored for a while
[02:18:07.940 --> 02:18:10.940]  but everybody's sort of forgotten not forgotten, but as
[02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:14.280]  Everybody's so excited about the phone that people have stopped talking about it
[02:18:14.280 --> 02:18:19.280]  Then maybe it'll come out at the September of it or at least be announced even if it doesn't come out
[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:21.280]  Yeah
[02:18:21.800 --> 02:18:23.800]  That's that whole
[02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:31.000]  I've just recently started wearing a Fitbit flex on my wrist part of it is just to start
[02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:34.440]  You know, what does it mean to have a thing on your wrist in the end?
[02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:37.000]  See, I thought I would think that would be a ring for you. Yeah, I
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.920]  Got the large band on so there we go
[02:18:44.280 --> 02:18:47.600]  But it's weird it's like I don't I
[02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:53.120]  Did you know this is a great little product, but I don't see an Apple logo on it
[02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:59.640]  No, I don't think so. But anyway, I still think that that's I and again not because anybody has said hey
[02:18:59.640 --> 02:19:01.720]  I think that the wearable thing is coming in September
[02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:05.840]  I'm just trying to think how do you plot two events that have like a story and
[02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:09.760]  I think that one of them has to be about continuity and
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:15.680]  I don't I think that's the October event. I think that is when they have new iPad new iPads
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:17.680]  That's when they ship Yosemite
[02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:22.160]  And so I think that to me leaves the September one for health
[02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:25.960]  Because I think there's got to be a health related event this fall
[02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:32.280]  Yeah, if somebody's working his butt off to get stuff ready for September 9th
[02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:39.920]  Yeah, you know Yosemite slash iOS iCloud all that stuff happening at once. I'm like, ah, I
[02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:42.520]  Just don't hate it. It's it's plausible
[02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:49.320]  I mean what you're saying already to have if they weren't ready to have a health related event and possibly a health related new device
[02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:53.920]  In the fall, I don't know why they would have added health kit to iOS 8 to me
[02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:55.920]  Then they would have held it for iOS 9
[02:19:56.280 --> 02:19:58.280]  But I don't know
[02:19:58.640 --> 02:20:04.620]  Maybe because maybe if the health stuff is slipped from a 2014 thing
[02:20:04.620 --> 02:20:11.340]  They'll do it in like February or March in which case that it still needs to be an iOS 8 because iOS 9 won't come out
[02:20:11.340 --> 02:20:15.200]  For another year. What about that whole home kit thing too? That's kind of just
[02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:18.800]  Yeah, that would fit in too
[02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:23.680]  But that would fit in to me that would fit in at an iPhone event where you're talking about things like
[02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:28.880]  Opening your garage door when you get close right stuff like that, right, right. I
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000]  Don't know it's interesting times
[02:20:33.080 --> 02:20:39.160]  that's the thing that's so impressive about Apple right now is they've got so much stuff that
[02:20:39.160 --> 02:20:41.800]  They're working on. That's just
[02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:49.840]  Awesome. I mean that the you know, we were all blown away at WWDC by the the breadth of the stuff that they announced and
[02:20:51.080 --> 02:20:54.880]  Now that it's starting to become real. It's like
[02:20:56.080 --> 02:21:02.720]  The next you know that I totally believe, you know, somebody like Eddie Q saying this is the most impressive
[02:21:02.760 --> 02:21:05.200]  You know pipeline of products that they've had
[02:21:05.200 --> 02:21:09.000]  In you know, it's 20 years or whatever it was
[02:21:11.360 --> 02:21:13.640]  There's just they've got a lot on the queue right now
[02:21:14.120 --> 02:21:17.340]  And it's like and they got a how do they you know, how does it come out?
[02:21:17.340 --> 02:21:21.220]  I keep thinking about like there's a couple of sites that have put up like hey
[02:21:21.220 --> 02:21:28.320]  What should you expect and they show an iPhone 5 and a what a 4.7 inch phone would look like next to that
[02:21:28.320 --> 02:21:33.360]  What a 5.5 would look next to that and then how close that 5.5 is to the iPad mini
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:41.480]  you just have this nice continuum of devices and then add to that the possibility of a larger iPad and all of a sudden iOS
[02:21:41.480 --> 02:21:43.480]  is like a
[02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:46.200]  computing platform that covers everything
[02:21:47.240 --> 02:21:49.240]  right all sizes from
[02:21:49.760 --> 02:21:57.880]  Easily fits in one hand to a total two hand pro laptop size screen. Yeah, and then eventually they're gonna start making
[02:21:57.880 --> 02:22:04.560]  and laptops that have ARM chips in them and a whole nother interesting set of things that can happen
[02:22:05.200 --> 02:22:12.360]  But it's just amazing to me to think that it's evolved, you know already into something that's truly like a all-encompassing
[02:22:13.120 --> 02:22:18.600]  Computing platform. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's it's not surprising to me
[02:22:18.600 --> 02:22:22.800]  I mean, this is next, you know when this first came out it was
[02:22:23.400 --> 02:22:27.360]  Very clear to me this this is the next 30 years of computing, right?
[02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:32.320]  We're gonna be refining this touch display
[02:22:33.240 --> 02:22:40.680]  you know direct interaction mechanism for the next 30 years just like we have refined the mouse as a
[02:22:41.200 --> 02:22:44.280]  means of interacting with our computer for the past 30 years
[02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:47.600]  so
[02:22:47.600 --> 02:22:49.080]  this is just
[02:22:49.080 --> 02:22:51.520]  This is we're at that period room, you know where?
[02:22:52.400 --> 02:22:56.120]  There were all sorts of different kinds of Macs, right? There was the
[02:22:56.120 --> 02:23:03.520]  You know the original Mac there was a you know Mac with color display. There was a Mac with you know different
[02:23:04.280 --> 02:23:11.520]  You know bus architectures and you know, they they they just there was a $12,000 Mac to FX
[02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:17.960]  Yeah, you know that the 20th century the 20th anniversary Mac, you know, there's this huge big
[02:23:19.840 --> 02:23:22.040]  In some ways convoluted product line
[02:23:22.040 --> 02:23:24.040]  So
[02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:30.440]  But the Mac to FX cost more than like a Honda Civic, yeah
[02:23:32.200 --> 02:23:34.200]  Insane
[02:23:34.480 --> 02:23:35.760]  Yeah
[02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:37.760]  But God I wanted one so bad
[02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:43.440]  All right, Craig, let's yeah, let's call it a night. Thank you so much for your time. No, it's always a pleasure
[02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:44.760]  It's always a pleasure
[02:23:44.760 --> 02:23:49.440]  Anybody who's not even if he is slowed down if it if he is busy if you're not following Craig on Twitter
[02:23:49.440 --> 02:23:51.200]  You're you're missing out
[02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:53.200]  to goldmine
