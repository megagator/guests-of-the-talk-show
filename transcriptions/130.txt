[00:00.000 --> 00:29.760]  friend of the show Paul Kefasas texted me earlier today with an interesting question and he said if you heard somebody say that an out fielder went quote full can't say go on a ball what does that mean to you I'm not sure I know I I like the the thought experiment though I got it because I can never forget this play it was a
[00:29.760 --> 00:44.760]  play when when Jose Kensiko was on the sister Rangers he was playing right field and there was like what should have been a routine fly ball out of the warning track he lost it in it hit him on the head and bounced over for a home run
[00:44.760 --> 00:58.760]  it's it I will see if it's impossible I will put a put the I will put the link in the show now just where the guy I will send it to you now but
[00:58.760 --> 01:11.760]  it does sound impossible but it did happen and I think in I think you could probably if you had the right math degree you could probably prove mathematically that it could only have happened to Jose can't say go
[01:11.760 --> 01:27.760]  but seems that seems right yeah I know that's the second it's the second thing on you to the second search criteria for Jose can say go the first is just Jose can't say go in the second is Jose can say go ball hits head
[01:27.760 --> 01:44.760]  that's it I got the audio from your video so I don't want to get open what no this is great I'm listen
[01:44.760 --> 02:00.760]  here he goes here he goes he's going back he's going back thong it you think you'd have to try to do that no or that you'd have to try to do it on purpose
[02:00.760 --> 02:11.760]  right I'm not sure if you could do it on purpose right so what happened was it yesterday and yeah I guess it was yesterday Toronto Blue Jays left fielder Ben Revere
[02:11.760 --> 02:28.760]  was trying to catch a fly ball hit by the Orioles Matt weaters and it was it was gonna hit the wall about an about a foot short and he jumped up to catch it and it hit his glove and and went over for a home run so it would not have been a home run
[02:28.760 --> 02:37.760]  it would have been about a foot short and it instead was because he tried to catch in his glove to me that's not a full can't say go that that to me is like a half can't say go
[02:37.760 --> 03:06.760]  like it's got to hit your rights it's got to hit your head got to hit your head or some other but I mean you know I'm not sure if there's anything else more comical than the head that would actually work I think you're debasing the beauty of that play by calling it a full full yeah yeah yeah that's a half that's a half it best that's a half I can see the other that should be that should be the official scoring actually the other links are came up
[03:06.760 --> 03:34.760]  when I went to Google it when you type in Jose kids a guy and that is a fun it's a very fun game what auto completes the other one that came out was Jose can't say go knocked out and when that when that auto completed I thought I was like holy cow so I misremembered the play I was like I don't remember him getting knocked out on that play I thought that it just went over and you know he was okay turns out it's a different video he was in a celebrity boxing match
[03:34.760 --> 04:04.360]  and got knocked out in the first round naturally yeah naturally he was man who is he fighting vice-sikahima former Philadelphia Eagles I think he was like a safety and I kick returner and is now in fact a beloved local sports caster here in here in Philly vice-sikahima believe he's Hawaiian oh my god yeah
[04:04.360 --> 04:10.360]  but not for having having knocked out Jose can't say go exactly
[04:10.360 --> 04:29.760]  oh god I guess he I guess can't say go used to play at the for the local for our local team here for the rain years actually because the he was he was in the a's right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because it used to be the rain years used to be an a's farm team before the became a marriage farm team
[04:29.760 --> 04:42.760]  and so I remember going to a game one night and I'm pretty sure I get with the like the gift that thing you know if you get first 100 people or whatever was a okay Jose can say a bubble head doll
[04:42.760 --> 04:56.760]  that's a good name for a local team named after your local mountaintop mountaineer yeah unless they rename the mountain yeah well that happens nowadays right that's right yeah which I think they should but you know that's okay
[04:56.760 --> 05:26.720]  what a team name what a funny story that I'm guessing those people have heard this but it's uh it's uh it's uh there was it there's a mountain in Alaska and that everybody in Alaska calls it Denali and it's the like the indigenous name that you know they've been calling it that since you know I don't 100 years or whatever and then at some point 100 years ago some point a white man shows up a white man shows up and they named it mount McKinley after president
[05:26.720 --> 05:37.720]  McKinley who quite frankly was not a very good president no and in fact this is the part I did not know had never even stepped foot in Alaska and so
[05:37.720 --> 05:56.680]  was a long way to go back then president Barack Obama renamed it to Denali and to what it was originally named right and it's such a weird story because so much in in U.S. politics is just need jerk left right Republican Democrat
[05:56.680 --> 06:26.680]  you know anything you know Obama you know orders a hamburger and and Republicans complain that he didn't get a cheeseburger right and instead though is this very strange everybody in Alaska whether they're Republican or Democrat is very happy about this because it's apparently been like a sticking point for a long time because you know they don't like it and people in Ohio which is the home state of president McKinley very very upset too bad
[06:26.680 --> 06:27.680]  name one of your little mountains in Ohio Mount McKinley right now the name really exactly yeah yeah McKinley Hill yeah so to the rain rainier is actually I believe to Homer in whatever the I did which which native which native language it is if it's or if it's all of them if they all call it the same thing so basically the same I mean the same name as Tacoma right I did I did not know that
[06:56.680 --> 07:26.680]  yeah there you go this change that and then the the team could be the Tacoma to Homer's oh my god that'd be great that would be a good way to get on sports center on regular pace right they're not getting there the weather playing right now right actually I don't know how well the rainiers are doing but their parent team's not doing that well right I tried to explain to Jonas the other day about you remember Dick trickle
[07:26.680 --> 07:56.680]  he was like a mediocre mass card NASCAR driver did not have a you know great win record or anything like that but in the late 90s when like Keith Oberman and Dan Patrick were doing sports center I guess it was like the middle 90s and it's you know every night at 11 o'clock those two guys who went on you know two of the top sports casters in the country now whenever they reported NASCAR results they would say who came in first who came in second and where did Dick trickle finish
[07:56.680 --> 08:26.680]  so if they like you know so and so came in first so and so a second and Dick trickle finished 28th and and it was every single week it was so great and they never of course they never said why and I really had to go at Jonas did not believe me he we really had to like Google the guy and like look up his Wikipedia and and you can even find if you Google them you know references to the fact that he was always mentioned on sports
[08:26.680 --> 08:56.680]  so that's you need a catchy name like that if you're you know if you're not going to win if you're you know only a minor league franchise you need a good name like that to call that and that would have been a good baseball name too yeah yeah Dick trickle oh they should have put a baseball player right would have been yeah maybe that was it maybe that was he missed his calling yeah would have been like a relief pitcher like Raleigh fingers yeah right late innings late innings Dick trickle
[08:56.680 --> 09:26.680]  Dick trickle warming up in the bullpen oh thank god we have nothing real to talk about no no what do you want to start oh let's just get the Google logo thing out of the way okay that's why I brought in noted graphic designer yeah I was kind of wondering why I was I was being brought on but please continue probably you wanted somebody who knew less than you and I knew much more much less than you.
[09:26.680 --> 09:56.680]  you know here's the so Google chains are logo last week and I rather than write I should I'm going to write I sometime you know maybe it'll be when I get on the airplane but at some point I've got a right a longer piece and I have a whole bunch of links saved up because other people are writing about it. But my take on it what read your take I went short and sweet yeah and I said.
[09:56.680 --> 10:26.680]  to do it from memory it's pretty short but I better see I'll just search my home page for garbage there it is okay they're old logo was goofy this new one is simply garbage just write for a company with no taste. I know that's harsh but I meant I truly mean every word of that I really do I think it is a garbage logo I really do I think it is terrible.
[10:26.680 --> 10:56.680]  and they also have a logo which they didn't have before my right about that what would the what is the logo supposed to be like the the circle things yeah so there's like a circle yeah I mean so actually and the if you look in the what is it what's that little thing up in the the URL line the five icon yeah the faith I can write yeah so well I'm not sure what was up there before it was a G it was a lower case. But I see a G now I see a capital G.
[10:56.680 --> 11:26.680]  yeah but it's got the colors it's got the colors of the chrome icon yeah basically although actually no it's got blue because the chrome icon has blue in the middle this one has it on the outside so I thought it was just the chrome icon in the shape of a G but it's not. The only thing I would clarify about my I will write more but if I could if I could take my little short take again I would join I would add is that when I say the old logo was goofy I that I realize that's an incomplete thought because it was goofy.
[11:26.680 --> 11:56.680]  but over the years they had simplified it to a point where it was right it was goofy but goofy in the way that Google is goofy and I mean goofy like that they're sort of a quirky.
[11:56.680 --> 12:26.680]  I guess Yahoo and Hotmail were like the two that were most popular you got the new you know free email account and like you got like 10 megabytes of storage or 15 megabytes of storage or something like that and then on April 1st of like whatever year it was 2006 2007 whatever. Google announced that they have a new free email service called Gmail and you get like a gigabyte of storage it was like 50 times the storage.
[12:26.680 --> 12:56.680]  of these other services and it was April 1st which is internet jackass day and so I remember thinking like I think I think this might be true I think it's true that I've never once been taken in by an internet jackass day hoax I think and if not if if I haven't taken in it hasn't been bad like I've never once you know and I you know it's a point of pride for me that I've never once been full I remember like thinking like this is this is.
[12:56.680 --> 13:26.680]  I've never heard whether it's true or not but I think that's why they announced it on April 1st because I think they knew that it would have that reaction.
[13:26.680 --> 13:56.680]  and I think that the email was the are they kidding is this for real. Well that's the best thing to do on April 1st right because everybody's so sick of April 1st being full of these dumb Microsoft buys so and so.
[13:56.680 --> 14:15.680]  the epitomizes what is great and fun about Google that they can do they have amazing technology they have they think big. Right instead of thinking like let's double Yahoo storage let they were like let's give us 100 times. Yeah 100 times.
[14:15.680 --> 14:26.680]  They think they're not afraid you know that they have that sort of ambition in the imagination and they have this weird sense of humor where I wouldn't have put it past them to do it as a joke.
[14:26.680 --> 14:35.680]  And they do they are a company that does do jokes on April 1st you know like Apple for example never does April 1st jokes.
[14:35.680 --> 14:50.680]  And shouldn't it would be it would be terrible it but it you know I hate all not that good they're not that good at jokes that I'm really not trying to write I don't think Google's jokes are that good either but you know they do them.
[14:50.680 --> 15:06.680]  But it's right for Google's brand that they do them you know in the fact that I don't really care for those jokes is just one of those reasons why I just am more of an apple person than a Google person but anyway all that is to say is that where their logo was before like up until last week.
[15:06.680 --> 15:21.680]  Was to me it was goofy but goofy in the right way and it looked you know it had like a certain stateliness to it and the fact that it was this sort of weird old timey Sarah font that nobody really uses anymore.
[15:21.680 --> 15:43.680]  It was just like a weird quirk but it was instantly recognizable and you know all in a good way and I think that it it was it just had the right tone it was there they're old look I mean I so calling it goofy and leaving it that makes it sound like I was putting their old logo down to what I meant is that their old logo was goofy.
[15:43.680 --> 15:58.680]  And so you can criticize it in and of itself as a logo and a lot of the people who have written pieces supporting the new logo you know they're correct in all the ways that their old logo was kind of weird and you know.
[15:58.680 --> 16:14.680]  It was really good for Google and this new one to me it's just it's so childish looking it's it's ridiculous it's absolutely ridiculous and it's I think you think it's.
[16:14.680 --> 16:31.680]  How do you think it's childish because it looks like those those letters that you put on refrigerators yeah it just to me the tone of these shapes of letters the the.
[16:31.680 --> 16:39.680]  Complete geometric roundness of these letters and and like and the best letter to look at to me is the lowercase g.
[16:39.680 --> 16:53.680]  Kind of a kid learning to write for the first time I mean the oh they're just perfect circle so it's hard to complain about them but but just the G is really where it stands out as very very childish looking.
[16:53.680 --> 17:04.680]  And I don't think that's good at all I mean other people have pointed out that it's it's extremely similar to the like the four color g logo that they have now uppercase g.
[17:04.680 --> 17:09.680]  It's very very similar to a logo that Jim berry had used for like.
[17:09.680 --> 17:19.680]  I don't think it's a problem in that they rip them off it's not you know there's there's only so many ways to do primary colors which already was part of Google's brand.
[17:19.680 --> 17:23.680]  You know the blue red yellow green.
[17:23.680 --> 17:40.680]  If you're going to stick to these primary like you know right out of the eight color crayola box look and do a uppercase g. There's only so many ways to do it so I wouldn't call it a rip off but the fact that it is so similar in tone to a logo for.
[17:40.680 --> 17:49.680]  A romper room for three year olds it really really says to me how childish it is as a brand.
[17:49.680 --> 18:01.680]  I really liked for example with their old logo I liked the way that when they made icons like for example like when they put a you know the logo on the Google Maps icon.
[18:01.680 --> 18:15.680]  Or their old fav icon that instead of using the first g the uppercase g they use the middle g the lower case one and you knew that that was Google's g it's a Google owned that lower case g.
[18:15.680 --> 18:23.680]  And I thought that was a really cool way and I thought it was very very apt for their brand and the sort of tone of their company.
[18:23.680 --> 18:32.680]  Whereas now they're stuck with this uppercase g and it's very generic looking yeah generically childish.
[18:32.680 --> 18:37.680]  Part the other part of your argument the last part of your argument though.
[18:37.680 --> 18:46.680]  A company with no taste yeah I think that's probably what most people got hung up on.
[18:46.680 --> 19:04.680]  Well I don't you're on your they don't have taste I really I firmly believe it and there are here's the I guess the part that that gets lost in there is there are pockets within Google where there are good designers working and obviously have taste because there are some products that they put out.
[19:04.680 --> 19:07.680]  That are nicely designed.
[19:07.680 --> 19:14.680]  But institutionally they have no taste at all because that some of their products are just horrendous.
[19:14.680 --> 19:21.680]  I for example I think Gmail just looks like it looks like garbage and it always has and I could never.
[19:21.680 --> 19:27.680]  I know I know probably a majority of the people listening to the show probably use Gmail.
[19:27.680 --> 19:36.680]  And if if not a majority of certainly a huge chunk use it and they use it right out of the web browser you know that's how they you know do their email.
[19:36.680 --> 19:42.680]  I don't think anybody does that because they like the way it looks they just like the way that it works.
[19:42.680 --> 19:46.680]  It looks terrible it's it could just a jumbled ugly mess.
[19:46.680 --> 19:51.680]  And and it's like one of their flagship.
[19:51.680 --> 19:55.680]  Products I would say it's second only to web search.
[19:55.680 --> 20:02.680]  I guess I don't find their taste any worse than anybody else's particularly other than with the possible exception of Apple.
[20:02.680 --> 20:09.680]  I mean obviously we prefer Apple so we're going to come down on the side of Apple has better taste but I mean I think that.
[20:09.680 --> 20:13.680]  I mean I would say that that's probably not.
[20:13.680 --> 20:24.680]  Too much of an argument I mean Apple has got other reverse right they they occasionally they do have things that show poor taste often in their comments as opposed to their design.
[20:24.680 --> 20:29.680]  But by and large it's the opposite case for them.
[20:29.680 --> 20:35.680]  But but the thing about Google I just don't think that their taste is really any worse than Microsoft's or anybody else's.
[20:35.680 --> 20:37.680]  I don't think Microsoft has good taste either.
[20:37.680 --> 20:38.680]  Yeah.
[20:38.680 --> 20:42.680]  Although they I think they've evolved better taste than Google.
[20:42.680 --> 20:44.680]  I think Microsoft.
[20:44.680 --> 20:46.680]  Yeah I think in.
[20:46.680 --> 20:49.680]  Maybe they're showing it in the last few years.
[20:49.680 --> 20:56.680]  I would even say just look at their look you know their logo redesigns you know I think that Microsoft redesign their logo within the last few years too.
[20:56.680 --> 21:03.680]  And I think for the better you know I think that they've they've gotten to a mark now that they can stick with you know forever.
[21:03.680 --> 21:04.680]  Right.
[21:04.680 --> 21:06.680]  And it's there's I don't think it's great.
[21:06.680 --> 21:11.680]  I there's nothing really that I would rave about Microsoft's current logo.
[21:11.680 --> 21:19.680]  But it was better than what they had before and it's and it seems to fit their brand to me.
[21:19.680 --> 21:22.680]  You know and so that to me is a sign of taste.
[21:22.680 --> 21:28.680]  I mean one of the reactions I've gotten from people on Twitter and I I almost can't believe that they exist in a world.
[21:28.680 --> 21:34.680]  I know there's people who don't care about logos really think that and think that they don't matter whatever but why would those people follow me on Twitter.
[21:34.680 --> 21:45.680]  Like I bet people have said dude it's just it's just a logo to get angry I think it's right to me that's like saying it's who cares what font you pick you know it's like I don't know.
[21:45.680 --> 21:57.680]  Like in the in the apartment building that is my mind love of typography and love care about logos share a bedroom.
[21:57.680 --> 22:06.680]  Well it's to me it's the same part of my brain it like I the same part of my brain lights up when I think about fonts as when I think about logos and branding.
[22:06.680 --> 22:19.680]  It's it's exactly the same part of my brain and and in some cases it's married together because in this case what I really don't like about Google's logo is the type of the the you know the word mark.
[22:19.680 --> 22:33.680]  Yeah it is I mean I don't I don't like it either but this always happens to me is like I I end up these things get announced and a whole bunch of people lose their shit over it and I look at it and I think.
[22:33.680 --> 22:44.680]  Often I will I will end up one way or the other like saying oh I like it and then someone will write a very thoughtful post on why I shouldn't like it and I'll think oh yeah okay I can see that or the other way around.
[22:44.680 --> 22:58.680]  So I don't feel like I feel lost in this in this world but I did not I did not like it on first on first glance and also I mean I kind of understood why they did it because they've reorganized.
[22:58.680 --> 23:14.680]  I also but at the same time I still don't get I think that I think that companies tend to do that too much and often it's a bad impulse to rush out and redesign your your logo to reflect some sort of.
[23:14.680 --> 23:28.680]  Business reason that your customers really probably don't give a crap about yeah I it's a very interesting point and now that you've said I I have been thinking that like in the back of my head I think you're exactly right that it's.
[23:28.680 --> 23:48.680]  I think you're probably tied to this alphabet parent company and and honestly and I know it I do care deeply about logos and I really do you know I do think that they matter at or at least they can matter tremendously like I think for example the apple logo.
[23:48.680 --> 24:02.680]  It just you can't put a value on it it's it is incredibly valuable to the company and it's so meaningful to me that they can it you know have these retail stores that don't even say the name of the store they've never had a.
[24:02.680 --> 24:08.680]  Never put the name of the store anywhere they just put this mark out in front and everybody knows what it is.
[24:08.680 --> 24:24.680]  And they can make laptops that have this mark when I opened up and you can just see that you know you when you go into a coffee shop that everybody is using one of their laptops and it's incredibly valuable.
[24:24.680 --> 24:39.680]  It technically not their first logo. No well no not officially there's the the old Newton Newton sitting under a tree right. Which was terrible logo it was a very nice drawing.
[24:39.680 --> 24:50.680]  It doesn't really catch doesn't really catch the eye though I'll put it in the show notes I bet most people listening I've seen it but if you haven't you'll be shocked at the first apple computer.
[24:50.680 --> 24:58.680]  The company logo very well drawn it was very nice but it is a terrible logo.
[24:58.680 --> 25:09.680]  Yeah but that's interesting I do think that it's in it that they're changing the logo is inextricably tied to this sort of corporate reshuffling and honestly and not to read too much into it so all this said that I care about
[25:09.680 --> 25:24.680]  matter I actually do think that it is a sign I can't articulate it logically it's a feeling but I just feel it that it's a very bad sign for Google like to me it's a sign that they've lost their way.
[25:24.680 --> 25:39.680]  I don't have money in Google I don't have any money in any individual companies but if I did I would think very very seriously about about selling my Google stock that I don't know I think they might be in for some bad times ahead.
[25:39.680 --> 25:47.680]  And it's not just the logo it's the everything it's like the fact that like Larry and Sergey.
[25:47.680 --> 25:54.680]  I think that's I suppose to pronounce I've been calling pronouncing it a different way but I got some so mean.
[25:54.680 --> 25:55.680]  Oh that's a hard G.
[25:55.680 --> 25:56.680]  Sergey Sergey.
[25:56.680 --> 26:16.680]  I didn't know that either that you know that they've seemingly I've been thinking about this alphabet reshuffling and to me as I think about I think what it really means is that those two guys who could do whatever they want because they're filthy red be the way that the ingenious way that they've structured the stock for the company they can do whatever they want with the company.
[26:16.680 --> 26:30.680]  They don't have to answer to anybody which is great I you know I've always thought Steve Jobs must have looked at the way they set that up and thought you know god damn I wish I'd done something like that.
[26:30.680 --> 26:50.680]  That they've lost interest they've lost interest in what Google as we know it is and that they just they want to do other things you know to me that for Google you know whether the prospects for alphabet are bad I don't know maybe they've got some great new stuff up there sleep but for Google as we know it I feel like they're going into a decline.
[26:50.680 --> 27:07.680]  Yeah I mean in a way because it seems like they're taking they're taking the stuff that they think is the long term growth stuff out of Google right and other places right and this and this logo change makes me feel that the people left it left it Google you know what is now just Google.
[27:07.680 --> 27:22.680]  Really don't they don't get what Google what made Google great they don't get it I think because to me this brand doesn't fit what the best of Google feels like.
[27:22.680 --> 27:29.680]  I was thinking well I was thinking that it was that it was more dictated by alphabet.
[27:29.680 --> 27:46.680]  Rather than done with internally to Google but I mean maybe they maybe they said to go out and design a new logo or or maybe they said we have to make sure that the alphabet brand is all consistent and we're going in a different direction.
[27:46.680 --> 28:01.680]  Maybe I don't know but I think they've lost something that was pretty good and replaced it with something that's terrible.
[28:01.680 --> 28:16.680]  I mean I would not say that they have no taste but I don't think their taste is good as I'm there are people in the in teams within the company with great taste institutionally the company has no taste.
[28:16.680 --> 28:20.680]  That's what that's my argument and I think that it's a very strong argument.
[28:20.680 --> 28:36.680]  Anyway let's take a break and I'll tell you about a very good friend of the show Harry's you guys know Harry's they sell high quality razors blades and other you know shaving lotions and creams and shaving stuff.
[28:36.680 --> 28:53.680]  And they sell it for a fraction of the price of the big brands they were started by two guys who just wanted to make a better product and figured there had to be a way to sell shaving stuff especially blades cheaper than what the big blade companies sell stuff for.
[28:53.680 --> 29:10.680]  So they started ordering blades from their own factory in Germany they like the blade so much they just bought the factory must be nice so they just own their own blade factory they make their own blades in Germany, place it's been making blades for a long time.
[29:10.680 --> 29:27.680]  And then they ship them right to you so there is no middle man that's how they have the prices so much lower so you know you buy like Gillette it's you know going to warehouses and middle man and distributors and ends up in a retail store and every step of the way it all gets marked up.
[29:27.680 --> 29:42.680]  They're starter set it's an amazing deal 15 bucks you get a razor that's the handle you get moisturizing shave cream or gel your preference whether you want a cream or gel and three razor blades 15 bucks and when you need more blades.
[29:42.680 --> 29:55.680]  Depending on how many buy them at they're always two bucks are each less so like an eight pack which is like a small one it's just 15 bucks but you can get a 16 pack 25 bucks way way better.
[29:55.680 --> 30:06.680]  I think on Amazon the last time I checked here is it says a 12 pack of fusions from Gillette which is very comparable I think it's it's actually the blade I used to use before I switched to Harry's.
[30:06.680 --> 30:19.680]  They have a 12 pack for 41 bucks so that's Amazon you know is not getting under cut out price so way more it's like three bucks a blade more than three bucks a blade for Gillette less than two bucks.
[30:19.680 --> 30:30.680]  A blade for Harry's so if you're looking to if you're just looking to save money Harry's is the way to go if you care about design Harry's is also the way to go really nice packaging.
[30:30.680 --> 30:39.680]  I've always said this they're packaging it's so nice it makes me not want to throw it away and then I realized that that's the crazy that that's just the crazy hoarder.
[30:39.680 --> 30:53.680]  But I know exactly what you mean it's really well done as I stared in my left in my office here and look at this stack of old Apple laptops.
[30:53.680 --> 31:02.680]  Got like eight old power books I've got I books they're all stacked up that's what I feel like when I get Harry's I almost cursed them for the quality of their packaging.
[31:02.680 --> 31:10.680]  If you care about design Harry's is the way to go if you care about just being cheap Harry's is the way to go.
[31:10.680 --> 31:19.680]  If you care about quality shave so you're not like cutting yourself up and you know making a messier face Harry's is the way to go their blades are super sharp really great.
[31:19.680 --> 31:31.680]  And if you care about just being lazy it's the way to go because you don't even have to leave your house they just show up and you can if you want to you can even like tell them how often you need to replace your blades and just subscribe and they'll just send them to you on a regular basis.
[31:31.680 --> 31:35.680]  So you lose you win I mean every way.
[31:35.680 --> 31:43.680]  So go there to Harry's dot com h a r r y s dot com and if it's your first purchase use this code talk show.
[31:43.680 --> 31:51.680]  They don't have the the it's just talk show and you'll say five bucks off your first purchase so that $15 kid I was telling about is only ten bucks so it's practically free.
[31:51.680 --> 31:58.680]  So go there and check them out at Harry's dot com and remember the code talk show.
[31:58.680 --> 32:05.680]  My notes here confusing I don't know it says then and then down below here it says promo code the talk show so I don't even know what the code is.
[32:05.680 --> 32:13.680]  Try them both and one of one of them will give you one of them right if you don't get money off try again.
[32:13.680 --> 32:19.680]  And then try and then try Gruber yeah.
[32:19.680 --> 32:27.680]  What else is going on so we got this Google logo thing out of the way I guess we'll talk to this talk about the event because that maybe that you want to do you want to do that or you want to talk about speak because on
[32:27.680 --> 32:30.680]  no taste we could talk about the Samsung watch.
[32:30.680 --> 32:36.680]  Oh that's a good one yeah we could talk about that yeah which I actually think I actually think looks really nice.
[32:36.680 --> 32:50.680]  But I wrote a piece about the difference between square watch faces and round watch faces and I kind of think that square watch faces are actually more the way of the future than.
[32:50.680 --> 32:52.680]  Round watch faces.
[32:52.680 --> 32:58.680]  I got the article I did not even know you wrote this piece is nice yeah I'll put that in the show notes I'm going to let that up.
[32:58.680 --> 33:05.680]  All right so tell me why do you think that well I'm not in again I you had you had the guy who's not a designer on.
[33:05.680 --> 33:20.680]  But from the things that I've read from people who are actually designers it's just it's certainly easier to code for a square face and get and but also a square faces better at representing most information.
[33:20.680 --> 33:26.680]  That's not to say that there aren't certain instances were around.
[33:26.680 --> 33:36.680]  The picture of something is not more valuable in a square one it's just saying that you can you can easily more easily get a circle into a square than the other way around.
[33:36.680 --> 33:48.680]  You could get a circle into a square without losing any size yeah whereas you cannot get a square into a circle without losing size yeah that's a that is exactly what I have thought.
[33:48.680 --> 33:59.680]  Well would I have been shocked if a year ago and it would have been exactly a year ago as we talked that if you know when they unveiled the Apple watch if it had been circular.
[33:59.680 --> 34:01.680]  I guess I wouldn't have been shocked.
[34:01.680 --> 34:08.680]  But I wasn't surprised at all that apples was rectangular.
[34:08.680 --> 34:21.680]  Because of that exact thing that it's for generic display that might end up displaying anything including and I think especially today's apple post.
[34:21.680 --> 34:24.680]  App store and iPhone Apple.
[34:24.680 --> 34:40.680]  Realizes that the Apple watch was if it's successful would end up being used in ways that they'd never imagined right that's the that's like the big lesson of.
[34:40.680 --> 34:45.680]  Of the iPhone to me is you know that there was this.
[34:45.680 --> 34:58.680]  You know this whole internal debate I think Ben Thompson and I were talking about it last episode that it's just so funny that there was a camp within the company that was sort of like we don't need an app store you know we'll we'll just make all the apps we need ourselves.
[34:58.680 --> 35:09.680]  And partner with companies you know like Google for the YouTube app and the Google Maps app that shipped on the first iPhone we'll just partner with people and we'll we'll make all the apps but we need for this thing.
[35:09.680 --> 35:22.680]  So like for example I do think that Apple foresaw that there would have you know right away that there would be a second screen of apps you know I think that they had the idea that you'd page between from left to the right you know to get to more apps.
[35:22.680 --> 35:31.680]  I think though that there was a side within the company that though you know that'll be there there'll be our apps yeah there'll be like twenty twenty four apps for the iPhone that it'll be great.
[35:31.680 --> 35:42.680]  And that's so far so far he was the outlet for you know that I actually think that you know that when they announced that at the first WWE see that we have a sweet solution for you guys.
[35:42.680 --> 35:44.680]  I think that they meant it.
[35:44.680 --> 35:55.680]  I think there were some people within the company who wanted you know definitely was pushing for the app store angle you know who who who cringe at that just all the developers in the audience watching the keynote did.
[35:55.680 --> 36:09.680]  But I think that some of them thought this you know that's that's good enough for like you know and I think they foresaw things like you know like well you do your online banking on your phone well you know to they'll just write a website that works that fits right on this screen.
[36:09.680 --> 36:17.680]  So I think you know now low these many years later and all these literally millions of apps and all the money they're making on the apps.
[36:17.680 --> 36:30.680]  They realize hey the phone is being used in ways we never imagine I think they knew going into it with the watch they would be used in ways they didn't imagine and I think a rectangle is better generic shape than a circle for that.
[36:30.680 --> 36:48.680]  And the thing that one of the things that struck me what even just like while I was writing this piece was that because I went back and looked at all the old watches that I had lying around and.
[36:48.680 --> 36:59.680]  Which I like and don't like but I like it because it's got a lot of extra information on it and the problem that I had was like I wanted to watch face with a date on it and.
[36:59.680 --> 37:08.680]  And I also wanted to watch face that I could get the most complications on and the way you do that and most of them is by putting the date inside the watch face.
[37:08.680 --> 37:24.680]  Yeah well most of those are too small for me to read because I'm too old for it now and the other thing is that five minutes out of every hour you can't read the date anyway because the hand the minute hand is covering it.
[37:24.680 --> 37:26.680]  Yeah I've thought the same thing.
[37:26.680 --> 37:38.680]  Yeah and that's and that's sort of like it was interesting how I went back and looked at those old watches and thought yeah I mean that's kind of a thing that I've struggled with for years really and never really.
[37:38.680 --> 37:58.680]  Which about but I mean you can it with a watch with physical hands the minute hand is always the one that's higher so you can kind of tilt to see around it in order to see what the data is.
[37:58.680 --> 38:13.680]  You get covered up at odd parts of the you know parts of the hour and become difficult to use so all that stuff is just adding information to a watch with a circular face and trying to put it inside that circle becomes really difficult.
[38:13.680 --> 38:39.680]  And the modular face white while I don't like certain things about it it just displays all the information and there is like a psychological angle to it to like the way that every but you know the famous the adage that you know if you drop a slice of butter toast it's always going to land butter side down it's because that's what you remember is the time that it did that it just seems like it's more than.
[38:39.680 --> 38:50.680]  More often than not when I want to check the date it's quarter after it's just like oh my god it's well how do I'll come every time I want to check the date it's quarter after and I can't see the day what the hell.
[38:50.680 --> 39:03.680]  And that's not true it's just that all the other times I check the data don't remember that but the times that I is blocked I remember and then it's it just feels like it's always quarter after right.
[39:03.680 --> 39:11.680]  Like when you play blackjack it seems like I always get 16 that's all I remember every goddamn hand only ever get 16 all I ever get or 16s.
[39:11.680 --> 39:16.680]  And the dealer gets a blackjack every goddamn time every time how is that possible.
[39:16.680 --> 39:30.680]  It's unreal yeah so that is true and I think that to it it also it stinks it stick that doesn't stick it sticks out with the apple watch even more because when it happens you realize that you have the option of.
[39:30.680 --> 39:35.680]  Changing to a different face that it fixes it you know like if you buy an analog watch.
[39:35.680 --> 39:38.680]  And the date gets covered up when it's quarter after.
[39:38.680 --> 39:44.680]  You might be annoyed but you don't think well I could spend 10 seconds here and change the lot facing and fix this problem.
[39:44.680 --> 39:50.680]  Right where's with the apple watch you you know it's always an option to switch to a different face where you have that problem.
[39:50.680 --> 40:00.680]  Yeah and so that Samsung watch the Galaxy Gear S2 yeah is a very nice looking.
[40:00.680 --> 40:08.680]  Circular face smart watch yeah but I feel I still feel like the circular face is the wrong.
[40:08.680 --> 40:25.680]  Yeah I think it's a design but maybe not catastrophically you know like maybe that's not necessarily going to limit the success of those watches but I do think you know I there and there are some people it's this is a funny little.
[40:25.680 --> 40:29.680]  Side topic this square versus round thing.
[40:29.680 --> 40:44.680]  There's a fair number of people who I've seen you know either an email or on Twitter you know communicating with me that that are predicting that apple will eventually go circular because circular you know circular watches look better people who look at the apple watch and say I just don't like.
[40:44.680 --> 40:52.680]  It looks like a you know looks too nerdy to me because it's square apples got you know they're going to go circular eventually and I don't think that's going to happen.
[40:52.680 --> 41:04.680]  I think it would be and I think that way too hard now of course apple changes things all the time and they're never really all that worried about making developers do more work.
[41:04.680 --> 41:15.680]  I mean they're not and they shouldn't you know if they were they it would actually slow them down and in the long run in the short run it's always it's never good if they're making if they make changes that make developers do more work like the.
[41:15.680 --> 41:25.680]  The big change in iOS seven where the you know pretty much every single app other than games had to redo their entire user interface or else they would look bad.
[41:25.680 --> 41:33.680]  That's you know it's a lot to ask every hey all of you with all of your apps have to redo all of entirety of your user interface.
[41:33.680 --> 41:42.680]  That's a lot to ask but it's the right move going forward rather than stick with something that's you know going to be outdated still waiting for a new icon from Instagram.
[41:42.680 --> 41:46.680]  There every did the interface right.
[41:46.680 --> 41:48.680]  I really wonder.
[41:48.680 --> 41:59.680]  I would love to hear what what the argument inside the company is on that because it their icon does really just being just being dicks at this point.
[41:59.680 --> 42:08.680]  And it's not hard to imagine just and I know flat is a overused term but just flat in the goddamn thing you know right right.
[42:08.680 --> 42:15.680]  We have the same colors yeah same colors I think it would move the drop shadow right.
[42:15.680 --> 42:18.680]  Defore stall it.
[42:18.680 --> 42:23.680]  Yeah I I do think the new set the the the new Samsung.
[42:23.680 --> 42:29.680]  I'm going to get it wrong I'm Twitter that I called it the G2 it's not the G2 it's the S2 GRS 2 2.
[42:29.680 --> 42:32.680]  I'm just going to call it the Samsung which is a two not a great name.
[42:32.680 --> 42:38.680]  I actually here's a case where I wish that they just cap copied Apple and just called it Samsung watch.
[42:38.680 --> 42:47.680]  Yeah because that's it then I could remember the name but anyway it it it you know and I was you know pretty complimentary to it when I linked to it.
[42:47.680 --> 42:53.680]  I you know and people people whose I saw people a few people said I'm surprised to see you be complimentary to it.
[42:53.680 --> 42:58.680]  And to me that it's like I'm never trying to be against Samsung or against Google.
[42:58.680 --> 43:07.680]  I'm saying what I really think and what I really think about most Samsung products is that they they're you know derivative crap.
[43:07.680 --> 43:15.680]  So therefore it seems as though I'm against Samsung because I keep saying that but it's because they keep putting out what I see is derivative crap and then they put out something that to me is.
[43:15.680 --> 43:21.680]  Interesting and original and looks pretty good and so I said you know it's interesting and original looks pretty good.
[43:21.680 --> 43:31.680]  They did copy a few things from the Apple watch right that that round I mean it's that with their system though it's apps instead of contacts right.
[43:31.680 --> 43:38.680]  Yeah yeah it looks like it looks like the contacts thing that that comes up when you hit the button on the side of the Apple watch except it's actually apps.
[43:38.680 --> 43:49.680]  Yeah and the other thing is did you see the interface it I couldn't find a better place to link to it but there's just a couple seconds of it in the verges video where they show.
[43:49.680 --> 44:05.680]  What it when you when you they don't call them complications I forget what they call them they came up with a new word for complications but whatever they call the complications on their watch faces that are user adjustable when you go into the edit mode it is exactly like Apple watch.
[44:05.680 --> 44:15.680]  Like there's a little there's there's dots at the top that you can swipe between which thing you're editing when you're like changing the.
[44:15.680 --> 44:27.680]  Like the color of the second hand it highlights in the same color and there's even they even like use like the same all caps in a round rack thing that says like color.
[44:27.680 --> 44:50.680]  If you look for it it is it's just exactly they like there it could not be more of a copy kind of embarrassing for them but.
[44:50.680 --> 45:00.680]  And you know thing that changes the interface this is a really good idea yeah it seems like and and by all reports from people who have had a hands on with it has a good feel to it which is important.
[45:00.680 --> 45:12.680]  It's you know it's funny it's it's it's actually like talking about this is exactly why I like having a podcast and because I almost feel like even if I had gone really long writing about it.
[45:12.680 --> 45:20.680]  It would be so much easier just to talk about it which is that I want to say I wanted to say look they copied a few little things but.
[45:20.680 --> 45:32.680]  Overall it's you know it's it's mostly an original design and kudos and a good one and kudos to them for that but I didn't want to mention the little things that they copied because then people would say you know how can you call this a copy.
[45:32.680 --> 45:41.680]  Right that the you know it's round instead of square how can you say it's a it's a rip off and I'm you know I'm not saying that I'm just saying they did steal a few things but.
[45:41.680 --> 45:49.680]  Everybody does that I so like I don't even think it's worth complaining about in the way that like Apple will steal things you know like command tab which was a windows you know intention.
[45:49.680 --> 45:57.680]  So taking little good ideas from the other guys is okay it's it's the you know when you wholesale copy deal.
[45:57.680 --> 46:06.680]  Right when you get Phil Schiller on the stand in a court case and they hold up a thing and he says I can't tell if I can't tell the difference.
[46:06.680 --> 46:11.680]  Stars there is and it's like you know that well you tell the difference.
[46:11.680 --> 46:14.680]  What are the other things I liked about it was that it it kind of.
[46:14.680 --> 46:18.680]  More so than any of the other any of the Android where watches.
[46:18.680 --> 46:24.680]  And then I know this one's based on ties and but that it has a good sense of what it is.
[46:24.680 --> 46:31.680]  Yeah there's like two of them there's like two levels right and one of them looks like to me like a swatch which is not a cut down.
[46:31.680 --> 46:39.680]  And the other one looks like a good like eighty dollar ninety hundred something like that sort of mid-range watch.
[46:39.680 --> 46:43.680]  And I'm sure they probably cost more because they have they have more features they should cost more.
[46:43.680 --> 46:46.680]  And it's it but we don't still don't know how much they're going to cost.
[46:46.680 --> 46:49.680]  But they didn't like.
[46:49.680 --> 47:01.680]  The to me the the Motorola just looks flat out terrible the three small three six he just looks terrible because it's just a cylinder cut off with like little prongs on the end to attach a band to.
[47:01.680 --> 47:03.680]  And then the other one that's a big.
[47:03.680 --> 47:05.680]  And right where watches the.
[47:05.680 --> 47:08.680]  The horribly named LG one the.
[47:08.680 --> 47:10.680]  Oh yeah watch or bane.
[47:10.680 --> 47:13.680]  Which looks like it's trying to be.
[47:13.680 --> 47:15.680]  A fancy watch.
[47:15.680 --> 47:23.680]  But it looks like it's made out of cheap materials is that the one that has numbers printed around the bezel like hardware printed around the bezel.
[47:23.680 --> 47:30.680]  I don't think so no no there's one that has like a third like fifteen thirty forty five.
[47:30.680 --> 47:35.680]  Around the outside which really he is really weird on a very strange on a smart watch.
[47:35.680 --> 47:41.680]  Yeah like it's I know why it's there because you're using it to tell time as the time but it just seems like a weird.
[47:41.680 --> 47:45.680]  It just seems weird that it's put on the hardware instead of doing it on the screen.
[47:45.680 --> 47:54.680]  But that's the one that people and the LG one is the one that people most point to and say or had up to date pointed to and said that looks like a real watch.
[47:54.680 --> 47:55.680]  Yeah.
[47:55.680 --> 48:00.680]  Which I mean you know there there happened square watches before.
[48:00.680 --> 48:03.680]  And also it looks like a real crappy watch to me.
[48:03.680 --> 48:10.680]  Yeah where's this one looks like a good like maybe you know somewhat more casual not super fancy but like a good watch.
[48:10.680 --> 48:23.680]  Yeah it's it's funny because I feel like in my experience you really do have to see any watch in person to truly get a sense of the size like seeing a photograph of it on somebody's wrist just doesn't really work.
[48:23.680 --> 48:28.680]  Although if it's if it's a huge enough like the original mode of two seventy.
[48:28.680 --> 48:35.680]  You can tell just by looking at the picture that it's your mother's but then when you look at it in real life you're like oh my god it's even bigger than I thought.
[48:35.680 --> 48:42.680]  But that said the numbers of the I think the Samsung there's two sizes 40 and 42.
[48:42.680 --> 48:54.680]  And 40 40 millimeters is really a standard size for a watch today like the old standard for men's watches older you know like going back decades was more like 36 millimeters.
[48:54.680 --> 48:57.680]  But 40 is pretty standard.
[48:57.680 --> 49:02.680]  And you know obviously comparable roughly to apples 42.
[49:02.680 --> 49:09.680]  It is interesting to me that even a year later even Samsung can't yet match Apple on the 38.
[49:09.680 --> 49:17.680]  Because I do think I do think one of the problems with the Samsung one so I think the Samsung one totally credible just as like a piece of jewelry on a man's wrist.
[49:17.680 --> 49:26.680]  And to me it's the first first one that's not the Apple watch that that qualifies for that really I don't even the LG one I don't really think looks that good.
[49:26.680 --> 49:37.680]  I don't I still don't think that the Samsung one even the smaller one I don't think it's going to be something that women would wear.
[49:37.680 --> 49:48.680]  I just don't think I don't think it's small enough yet and I think Samsung kind of knows it because I don't think any of the bands that they've done look like they're targeted at women.
[49:48.680 --> 49:51.680]  That's not to say no women will buy.
[49:51.680 --> 49:56.680]  I mean yeah right and watches are a funny thing where is an awful lot of different styles.
[49:56.680 --> 49:59.680]  I've seen lots of women wear like big chunky watches.
[49:59.680 --> 50:15.680]  Well and look at the Apple watch there's an awful lot of the you know especially the most popular ones like the sport the sport ones are you know unisex you know I think you know you could argue that the pink band is you know probably if you know more feminine.
[50:15.680 --> 50:27.680]  But I would say other than the pink all of the other colors even the black are are unisex you know I wouldn't say that you know that there's really any kind of gender towards that.
[50:27.680 --> 50:33.680]  I think that the the link bracelet is probably you know to me looks masculine.
[50:33.680 --> 50:42.680]  But most of the other ones I think are unisex but I think Samsung's with the like the leather and stuff like that I think they look like men's watches.
[50:42.680 --> 50:54.680]  Just in general yeah I mean I would say I would say that a man would be more likely to like it than than a woman which is not yeah not to make a flat out.
[50:54.680 --> 50:56.680]  Like it's David.
[50:56.680 --> 51:06.680]  So an interesting thing that I was not aware of somebody on Twitter pointed out to me that that the fact that they're using ties in instead of Android Wear.
[51:06.680 --> 51:14.680]  Opens up China to them and that Android Wear apparently is not there's no Android Wear watches aren't available in China.
[51:14.680 --> 51:20.680]  I could be wrong is just going from a guy in Twitter and I asked him to firefight he said that.
[51:20.680 --> 51:35.680]  I didn't know that this is true that you know how like with Android Android you know Samsung takes Android from Google and you know if they agree to such and such they can have these Google apps built in but they still get to customize the interface with you know what do they call it.
[51:35.680 --> 51:41.680]  They call it touch with you know and they can add their own apps and stuff.
[51:41.680 --> 51:46.680]  Android Wear there is no option to do that like Android Wear you get Android Wear and you do it.
[51:46.680 --> 51:52.680]  I think you can like you can add custom faces but that's about it like you can't just in the kind of your own apps in there.
[51:52.680 --> 52:04.680]  Yeah and it's like you and that's a problem in China because in China I guess all the Android phones are all you know instead of having Google search and stuff like that they've all got the Chinese equivalents.
[52:04.680 --> 52:06.680]  Right.
[52:06.680 --> 52:11.680]  So that's interesting because I've heard China is a big market.
[52:11.680 --> 52:15.680]  Now the Apple watches are definitely on sale in China.
[52:15.680 --> 52:23.680]  Yeah well but that's somehow you know that's just Apple being Apple.
[52:23.680 --> 52:33.680]  I guess I don't even know I've got me thinking about it like if you're in China with an iPhone I guess that the app store has different apps.
[52:33.680 --> 52:36.680]  I mean I don't even know how that how that works.
[52:36.680 --> 52:42.680]  I've never really thought about that but with the way that China you know has the great firewall for internet access.
[52:42.680 --> 52:44.680]  How does the app store work in China?
[52:44.680 --> 52:47.680]  I actually probably do some research on this.
[52:47.680 --> 52:51.680]  Yeah we should probably all brush up by how things work in China.
[52:51.680 --> 52:53.680]  If anybody out there knows.
[52:53.680 --> 52:54.680]  It should have done that five years ago.
[52:54.680 --> 52:57.680]  If anybody out there knows send me email and explain this to me.
[52:57.680 --> 53:00.680]  I would love to hear about it but it seems very confusing to me.
[53:00.680 --> 53:09.680]  But anyway yeah I'm you know interested by your article but I do think Samsung did a good job with the desk too.
[53:09.680 --> 53:10.680]  Yeah.
[53:10.680 --> 53:11.680]  Yeah.
[53:11.680 --> 53:16.680]  The other thing I got me thinking about too and I've mentioned this on Daring Fireball.
[53:16.680 --> 53:21.680]  But the watch and it's kind of leads into the next topic which is next week in what we expect.
[53:21.680 --> 53:24.680]  But and you know talking about Apple TV.
[53:24.680 --> 53:31.680]  But the thing that's so weird about these smart watches is the way that they're all.
[53:31.680 --> 53:35.680]  And I think eventually they'll they'll be independent and they'll just have their own internet access.
[53:35.680 --> 53:40.680]  But the way that everybody's whether it's Apple's or Android's or Tizen.
[53:40.680 --> 53:48.680]  Is tied to the phone a phone that it's paired with to get it's you know most of its information and apps and stuff like that.
[53:48.680 --> 53:54.680]  That people don't really have a choice here like if it's really do you want to get a smart watch or not.
[53:54.680 --> 53:57.680]  And if you do you know you're on one side of the fence.
[53:57.680 --> 54:01.680]  You're only going to get you can only use an Apple watch if your if your phone is an iPhone.
[54:01.680 --> 54:04.680]  And right you know and I guess.
[54:04.680 --> 54:08.680]  Can use you can use an Android where now on the on the iPhone.
[54:08.680 --> 54:10.680]  But you're it's very very unlikely.
[54:10.680 --> 54:16.680]  I mean that's it's yes who I just can't imagine how many people would do that.
[54:16.680 --> 54:18.680]  Right it's very unlikely.
[54:18.680 --> 54:19.680]  Yeah.
[54:19.680 --> 54:27.680]  And supposedly I guess the Samsung was quoted recently as saying that they're they're going to try and bring it the Tizen watch to the iPhone as well.
[54:27.680 --> 54:30.680]  Why bother I honestly I don't I would like to try one.
[54:30.680 --> 54:34.680]  I guess it would be interested in trying it would be not depending on how much of cost but I would.
[54:34.680 --> 54:35.680]  Right.
[54:35.680 --> 54:37.680]  I might pick up the low end one and give it a try.
[54:37.680 --> 54:40.680]  Yeah I would do that but that's just me being right stupid.
[54:40.680 --> 54:42.680]  I mean I I shouldn't even call it stupid.
[54:42.680 --> 54:46.680]  I could totally justify it as a business expense that I might write about same reason that I bought the pebble.
[54:46.680 --> 54:51.680]  You know I paid for both generations of pebble just so I could speak about them intelligently.
[54:51.680 --> 54:56.680]  Knowing going in that it was almost certain that I wasn't going to actually wear it regularly.
[54:56.680 --> 54:57.680]  Right.
[54:57.680 --> 55:05.680]  But I just think it makes it so you know interesting and a little sad because I do wish that they were independent so that I could just spend.
[55:05.680 --> 55:09.680]  Because I'm going to I'm going to guess that that Samsung one is like 300 to 400 dollars.
[55:09.680 --> 55:11.680]  That's what I'm going to guess.
[55:11.680 --> 55:14.680]  Maybe maybe up to five but probably not.
[55:14.680 --> 55:17.680]  I just don't see how they could justify it.
[55:17.680 --> 55:19.680]  Do you know I wouldn't I wouldn't think it's that much.
[55:19.680 --> 55:20.680]  I wouldn't think it's that much.
[55:20.680 --> 55:23.680]  I was wondering if it might be a little bit cheaper like 250.
[55:23.680 --> 55:24.680]  Yeah.
[55:24.680 --> 55:28.680]  Did you see I know you mentioned this too in your article that there's a new
[55:28.680 --> 55:31.680]  new generation of Moto 360s.
[55:31.680 --> 55:35.680]  They're still there's still two seventies even a year later.
[55:35.680 --> 55:40.680]  They've still got the the entire design.
[55:40.680 --> 55:42.680]  I thought you made a mistake earlier.
[55:42.680 --> 55:44.680]  I get it now.
[55:44.680 --> 55:46.680]  When you call it a 270.
[55:46.680 --> 55:47.680]  Oh I've been doing that for a while.
[55:47.680 --> 55:49.680]  I've been doing that all year.
[55:49.680 --> 55:54.680]  I think I really want to I wish that they just renamed it in the Moto 270.
[55:54.680 --> 55:57.680]  It is smaller.
[55:57.680 --> 56:08.680]  But did you notice that they've come out and again I wouldn't call this copying Apple but it's come out with a very large variety of colors and bands and
[56:08.680 --> 56:12.680]  straps you know to choose from.
[56:12.680 --> 56:22.680]  I wouldn't say that that's ripping off Apple at all because you know that's just you know that's but it's just interesting to me though that Apple defined
[56:22.680 --> 56:26.680]  this that aspect of the smart watch right away.
[56:26.680 --> 56:34.680]  You know that that the way to go is to be you know to have you know get in all the accessories right and cover of a
[56:34.680 --> 56:38.680]  reasonable range of styles.
[56:38.680 --> 56:47.680]  Which is interesting that they they because they have never done that with the iPhone particularly or the iPad.
[56:47.680 --> 56:51.680]  They'll make they'll make us couple of cases and that's it.
[56:51.680 --> 56:53.680]  Yeah.
[56:53.680 --> 56:59.680]  Because they had I guess they have a few they have a few iPhone cases now don't they they have like a leather one and a plastic one.
[56:59.680 --> 57:04.680]  Yeah but they yeah but it's not a big deal it's nowhere near as.
[57:04.680 --> 57:05.680]  No.
[57:05.680 --> 57:09.680]  And they have lots of watch bands now and that's one of the things that may be coming next week.
[57:09.680 --> 57:11.680]  Yeah more bands.
[57:11.680 --> 57:18.680]  Yeah well I one thing I do notice like so for example I saw a ton of iPhones yesterday just because there's a.
[57:18.680 --> 57:28.680]  Like a huge free music festival this weekend here in in Philly it's like Jay-Z and Beyonce and it's like the Budweiser.
[57:28.680 --> 57:34.680]  Made in America Fest or something I mean like seriously like hundreds of thousands of people out on our parkway.
[57:34.680 --> 57:42.680]  And of course I did not go go to it but I went for a run yesterday and I thought well I'm going to go you know that there gives me a target.
[57:42.680 --> 57:49.680]  You know a couple of miles and I go up there and check it out and you know thousands I mean just thousands of people were heading towards it.
[57:49.680 --> 57:53.680]  And you know lots and lots of people with their phones out.
[57:53.680 --> 58:02.680]  And it's just I just struck me yesterday that you know every it just seems like almost everybody has a phone or an iPhone and.
[58:02.680 --> 58:08.680]  I could tell you know you always tell from the camera placement if it's an iPhone because the iPhone's only one that has it up in the corner.
[58:08.680 --> 58:14.680]  And that everybody has a case and that I don't think I saw anybody with the same cases each other.
[58:14.680 --> 58:21.680]  Like I think if I had taken a picture of every single person I saw with an iPhone and it would have been dozens and dozens of people.
[58:21.680 --> 58:24.680]  That no two people have the same case.
[58:24.680 --> 58:30.680]  You know it's tons of variety there and I kind of feel like that's a less I feel like Apple has sort of embraced that.
[58:30.680 --> 58:36.680]  And the more I think about it as the years gone on like that that's why the camera bump is there.
[58:36.680 --> 58:41.680]  That's why they were willing to live with it because they realize that most people were going to use it in a case anyway.
[58:41.680 --> 58:48.680]  And so the camera bump doesn't matter even though for people like me it breaks my heart every single day.
[58:48.680 --> 59:01.680]  But camera bump. Yeah every day. There's not a day single not a single day has gone by in the last year that I have it has not occurred to me at least at some point when my finger has encountered that bump that this is gross.
[59:01.680 --> 59:05.680]  Wow. Every day. I could feel like I've gotten used to it.
[59:05.680 --> 59:09.680]  I don't feel like I give it too much of a thought.
[59:09.680 --> 59:12.680]  Well I and you know you don't use a case.
[59:12.680 --> 59:24.680]  No I've never used a case. Months ago for months I thought like last year I thought well that's something that they could fix next year with the success because even with the S year where they don't really change the physical design.
[59:24.680 --> 59:27.680]  Surely they could just make the camera flush with the back.
[59:27.680 --> 59:36.680]  But now I'm thinking I'm not expecting it next week. It's funny because it's you know it's the way that I obsess over these tiny little details that most people don't.
[59:36.680 --> 59:42.680]  It's like the main thing I'm curious about for next week is whether or not the new phones will have a bump.
[59:42.680 --> 59:50.680]  I think they probably will because I think that they've I think that they've kind of given into the fact that most people use the phone in a case.
[59:50.680 --> 59:56.680]  Well I mean but isn't the reason there's a bump simply physics.
[59:56.680 --> 1:00:02.680]  Yeah yeah it's but they you know you know so they in order to get the right focal length right.
[1:00:02.680 --> 1:00:11.680]  Right the desk they asked me a certain depth and they because they want the phone to be thinner at some point the camera has to stick out.
[1:00:11.680 --> 1:00:21.680]  Well or that or they if it didn't stick out it would be a crap your camera right it would be a less visually you know what would be the word it would be a worse camera.
[1:00:21.680 --> 1:00:26.680]  Right you know at some point you know but they could make it stick out more and have it be better.
[1:00:26.680 --> 1:00:33.680]  So I think it should I think it should be telescoping.
[1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:54.680]  I think that the old apple I think prior to last year I think that it was just non negotiable though that it was going to be flush and that they would you know here's how thick will make it with you know taking all these factors into how thick the thing is going to be how strong it is how much battery they need how how can you know I think how thick an iPhone is is probably you know and incredibly complex.
[1:00:54.680 --> 1:01:03.680]  It's not like they just decide it's all of these factors how strong it is is it going to you know is it going to bend famously.
[1:01:03.680 --> 1:01:13.680]  And you know how good how good will the camera be and I think it's you know I think before though they'd come to some conclusion and then they would make the best camera that would fit in that.
[1:01:13.680 --> 1:01:29.680]  So we can make it this thing but then the cameras kind of kind of be crap and they like you know took a shot of whiskey and I just imagine it I just imagine that Johnny I really had to take a.
[1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:30.680]  Oh yeah.
[1:01:30.680 --> 1:01:31.680]  It had to take a stiff.
[1:01:31.680 --> 1:01:36.680]  It's not like being told that physics is the way it was.
[1:01:36.680 --> 1:01:43.680]  Let's take a break and then we'll talk about this week okay because I have to tell you about my good friends at fracture.
[1:01:43.680 --> 1:01:50.680]  These guys keep coming back keep sponsoring the show and the reason is that people keep buying pictures from them and that's great.
[1:01:50.680 --> 1:01:56.680]  These are the guys you guys know it I know everybody's let unless you're a new listener you know who fracture is.
[1:01:56.680 --> 1:02:05.680]  They're a service you send your digital photos to them and they print them directly on glass.
[1:02:05.680 --> 1:02:11.680]  Not really on the front of the glass it's actually behind the glass but it's an incredibly thin piece of glass.
[1:02:11.680 --> 1:02:20.680]  All sorts of sizes ranging from little desktop ones little square ones to big 23 by 29 ones which is really really big size.
[1:02:20.680 --> 1:02:30.680]  Really really thin piece of glass they print your image on the back of it so it shines through but it's so thin it really does look like it's on the surface of the glass.
[1:02:30.680 --> 1:02:42.680]  And again it's like that same effect as like when Apple started laminating the the iPhone displays to the touch screen to the glass where it no longer look like pixels under glass it look like pixels on the glass.
[1:02:42.680 --> 1:02:47.680]  That's exactly what these fractured prints look like really really neat effect.
[1:02:47.680 --> 1:03:00.680]  But also and I'm stealing this from Marcos read on an ATP recently and he I didn't really think about this until Marcos said it but because their glasses so thin their pictures are super super lightweight.
[1:03:00.680 --> 1:03:06.680]  And I've noticed that with the ones we have in our house too it's like usually with like a reason we size picture and the frame and everything.
[1:03:06.680 --> 1:03:15.680]  To big heavy thing on the wall and you know I know there's you know you get the special things you tap in the wall and it's you know it all every time I hang it used to hang the pictures I used to think this never.
[1:03:15.680 --> 1:03:17.680]  This is never going to.
[1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:26.680]  And I'm not handy so it's like I feel like you know I'm going to have to call someone then when there's you know the picture collapses and takes out a big chunk of the wall.
[1:03:26.680 --> 1:03:28.680]  We get earthquakes out here too.
[1:03:28.680 --> 1:03:30.680]  Yes you got a real thing.
[1:03:30.680 --> 1:03:42.680]  The fractures they're so lightweight I never have to worry I never I have a bunch of them hang around the house and I realized that they're the only pictures I've ever hung where I haven't walked stepped away from it thinking I'm going to watch this fall in 10 seconds.
[1:03:42.680 --> 1:04:01.680]  Really really lightweight it's just great I it's so great that if you've ever tried this you're never going to it has occurred to me I really do believe this you're never ever going to hang your own photographs by printing it on paper and then putting them in a frame again you're never going to use anything but fracture.
[1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:13.680]  And it solves so many other problems to another problem I have you go to Ikea and by frame you put a picture in there I never get the damn picture to sit so that when you close the thing up and you put all the
[1:04:13.680 --> 1:04:35.680]  and it just drops a little bit and you see like a piece of the backing behind the thing in there or your thumb prints on the inside of the glass yeah it's it's a mess like the old way of doing it I've I've been thinking about this lady because I've been trying to think a new things to say about fracture and last another one is like the old way of doing it where you have a picture that's printed out and you put it in a frame.
[1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:43.680]  It's a huge pain in the ass it's an enormous pain in the ass fracture solves all these problems so anytime you need to print a picture.
[1:04:43.680 --> 1:04:49.680]  Just go to fracture it's I can't even see why you would do anything else now here's the other thing you can.
[1:04:49.680 --> 1:04:53.680]  What's the code for I don't even know the goddamn notes don't have a code but.
[1:04:53.680 --> 1:04:58.680]  I could probably find out that they've sponsored the show recently I'll just go to my website.
[1:04:58.680 --> 1:05:02.680]  Probably the talk show what do you think.
[1:05:02.680 --> 1:05:07.680]  Yes that would be my that would be my guess knows like most no no.
[1:05:07.680 --> 1:05:09.680]  Daring fireball.
[1:05:09.680 --> 1:05:14.680]  We just make it a game let's make it a game for all these sponsors what the code is well anyway.
[1:05:14.680 --> 1:05:27.680]  Use that code Daring fireball when you go to fracture fracture me calm is there you are out go there use that code when you print your pictures out and you will say 15% off your first order.
[1:05:27.680 --> 1:05:40.680]  I really do mean this in a complete sincerity even if they never sponsored my show again I can't imagine why anybody else would buy you would ever print a photo any other way to hang on your wall than to go to fracture it's that good and that easy.
[1:05:40.680 --> 1:05:44.680]  So my thanks to them go go buy some pictures.
[1:05:44.680 --> 1:05:53.680]  All right we go to us we got we got next week should we talk about next week or well which is technically technically this week.
[1:05:53.680 --> 1:05:59.680]  So a couple days I will be flying to California.
[1:05:59.680 --> 1:06:06.680]  And Apple is having an event it's what it's Wednesday right it's a Wednesday event which is yeah.
[1:06:06.680 --> 1:06:16.680]  I was easy to figure out why I did I did I'm not smart until somebody else told me this but it's because they didn't want to make people fly on Labor Day.
[1:06:16.680 --> 1:06:31.680]  Apple loves us we have so much respect for me that they wanted to make sure I got a complete three day weekend to relax from my back breaking schedule.
[1:06:31.680 --> 1:06:39.680]  So that I didn't have to fly on Monday and I guess presumably so Apple themselves wouldn't have to work.
[1:06:39.680 --> 1:06:49.680]  I don't know I'm going to guess that most of the people involved in this event are probably pretty busy this weekend that they're not really relaxing but yeah no.
[1:06:49.680 --> 1:06:55.680]  Which is kind of looks probably stinks right I mean like school starts for us this week.
[1:06:55.680 --> 1:07:05.680]  Yeah same here I think at a thing in California started already though yeah I think it started I think it started last week because somebody I mentioned that to somebody else and they said now school started last week.
[1:07:05.680 --> 1:07:18.680]  Yeah a lot of places in Pennsylvania now that start and started last week too which is crazy to me I did a lot of places that start in August which to me just seems criminal yeah yeah although I mean this year Labor Day is really late.
[1:07:18.680 --> 1:07:22.680]  Yeah it is really late so starting after Labor Day is kind of yeah.
[1:07:22.680 --> 1:07:40.680]  But there are also I guess two you know you know what it might be it might be too that I would not be surprised one bit if this facility that the places has you know some kind of union workers that you know cannot be you know I have to get off for Labor Day.
[1:07:40.680 --> 1:07:47.680]  Yeah and that they need you know they definitely need to be in there doing stuff the day before so anyway it's all because of Labor Day.
[1:07:47.680 --> 1:07:52.680]  Thanks Labor Day. Thanks for nothing.
[1:07:52.680 --> 1:07:57.680]  All right so one of the things that might that might okay so new phones right.
[1:07:57.680 --> 1:08:04.680]  New phones are a sure thing I think that you know that there's the surest thing in the universe regarding this event.
[1:08:04.680 --> 1:08:09.680]  Yeah yeah and Mark Gurman says they might actually be thicker.
[1:08:09.680 --> 1:08:16.680]  Yeah slightly just slightly maybe for most people imperceptively thicker.
[1:08:16.680 --> 1:08:22.680]  Yeah I think that that's I think he's not even alone in reporting that there are a lot of the stuff that's come out.
[1:08:22.680 --> 1:08:24.680]  God damn kid has some sources.
[1:08:24.680 --> 1:08:32.680]  Yeah although some of them it's weird it's weird who some of his sources are like what they.
[1:08:32.680 --> 1:08:45.680]  I know him well enough I do trust him I think every single word he writes is true but that doesn't mean that all the things he says are going to happen are going to happen like he's always you know he'll say that you know like.
[1:08:45.680 --> 1:08:57.680]  He gave away the name of the force touch screen that it's the 3D touch screen that's what they're going to call it but that his source and this is just like yesterday or the day before but a source that said you know that it could change.
[1:08:57.680 --> 1:09:08.680]  Well it's like I believe him that somebody within Apple told him that that at some point they were thinking about calling it the 3D touch screen or whatever he says they're going to call it.
[1:09:08.680 --> 1:09:23.680]  But if his source really know they would you know today you know like 5 days before the event they would say they would know it for a fact you know I mean so like what he wrote is exactly true that it could be it could come out with another name.
[1:09:23.680 --> 1:09:35.680]  But that at some point that's what they were thinking about but that just you know but it's not so it's not it's not changing in between the time that the article is being published in the time of the announcement.
[1:09:35.680 --> 1:09:41.680]  They're not changing they're not changing the name behind the scenes and then running out and sanding it off of right.
[1:09:41.680 --> 1:09:45.680]  A bunch of boxes or whatever no re printing a bunch of.
[1:09:45.680 --> 1:09:52.680]  Yeah 3D he says are going to call it the 3D touch display which seems reasonable because it's you know got some kind of force.
[1:09:52.680 --> 1:09:56.680]  Yeah it's one of it's yeah it's a technology that not everybody is.
[1:09:56.680 --> 1:10:01.680]  Yeah although I mean I guess I guess it's going to be it you know if it's a feature that's.
[1:10:01.680 --> 1:10:12.680]  You know one of the we're on the talk here right and so they have to play up whatever they add to in order to get people to to go with that phone.
[1:10:12.680 --> 1:10:17.680]  Yeah so the force touch aspect of it actually becomes a big deal.
[1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:24.680]  Yeah yeah and the technology behind it becomes the kind of thing that you used to sell the the idea.
[1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:34.680]  Yeah okay you can touch on things and you get like a added functionality by the different ways you press on them.
[1:10:34.680 --> 1:10:53.680]  Yeah I think though it's interesting and he has a couple of you know it's written about before and you know a couple of ideas that you you know clearly somebody who's seen what they're tinkering with has spilled this to him you know that that if you force touch on an icon on the home screen that you'll get like a menu of.
[1:10:53.680 --> 1:11:05.680]  Options of what to do with the app you know that you know or that you could jump to something within the app so you could like just on the home screen force touch this is an example that the german gave you force touch on the phone app.
[1:11:05.680 --> 1:11:14.680]  And you'll get an option that would let you jump right to voicemail so you don't have to launch the app and yeah you know I don't know if that's I don't know if that's actually even easier but.
[1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:37.680]  But anyway that's what he says but he doesn't really have a lot though about what they're going to do with force touch what it's going to work yeah yeah and it's I you know it's just interesting how far down the chain you know his sources are because somebody within Apple knows everything about it and they I think that they've done actually a reasonable be good job of keeping that under wraps.
[1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:51.680]  Yeah it hasn't there hasn't been any I you know no screenshots know anything so german has said though that it's both because you know Apple's using this for stuff in different ways right like.
[1:11:51.680 --> 1:12:02.680]  On the Mac books it's a physical thing where you you press it and it gives you this false sense falsensation that it there's a physical click.
[1:12:02.680 --> 1:12:16.680]  On the watch it doesn't feel like it clicks it's just it uses the vibration yeah it uses the tactic engine but it doesn't feel like the screen clicks it feels like the watch itself is.
[1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:22.680]  Yeah it just gives you a tap it doesn't feel like the screen clicks.
[1:12:22.680 --> 1:12:41.680]  I wonder you know which way and it doesn't seem clear to me from the rumors and I'm glad I'm kind of excited to find out how it works like which way the phones are going to work is it just going to be like once in a while you force tap and the phone will give you a vibration to let you know that yes that registered as a phone.
[1:12:41.680 --> 1:12:53.680]  Tap which is I think what's more likely because it seems simpler or is it going to be more like the Mac book keyboard where when you click buttons on the screen it feels like the screen is clicking where you tapped it.
[1:12:53.680 --> 1:13:07.680]  Yeah which would be kind of amazing but I'm almost like that's what I'm hoping for but I almost feel like that's what I would hope for to yeah yeah but I feel like I'm hoping you know you know to hit the lottery you know I mean like I don't feel like that's a realistic.
[1:13:07.680 --> 1:13:25.680]  Yeah and I wonder if the thickness is related to that screen or if the thickness is more battery well but the rumor again you know we're all dependent on german here but I think it was german at least who says that the batteries are actually smaller.
[1:13:25.680 --> 1:13:38.680]  Now that could just you know that they're actually fewer. Yeah and oh oh actually less power yes slightly whatever that what's the metric for batteries megawatt hours whatever it is.
[1:13:38.680 --> 1:13:54.680]  You know those numbers that are like in the 1800 2000 range that they're actually a little smaller in both phones but that could be though you could be the same thing that to fit the forced screen in there and whatever else they're fitting in left less room for battery.
[1:13:54.680 --> 1:14:14.680]  So they made it a little thicker so they could at least like if they hadn't made it thicker than the battery would even be smaller than the actual decrease that they're going to do right yeah they had to decrease the battery because of whatever the else they're putting in there and if they hadn't made it a little thicker they would have had to make it even more of a drop.
[1:14:14.680 --> 1:14:28.680]  Yeah are you in the more battery camp because there was a big sort of surge of people within the last year who were saying enough with making them thinner just make the battery last longer.
[1:14:28.680 --> 1:14:54.680]  Yeah yeah I think if they asked me I would rather have the iPhone 7 not decrease and in fact here I'm just looking at nine to five Mac there's actually a report here just not a german it's they're reporting on Ming Chi Quo who knows you know these are the KGI analyst over in Asia who who's had pretty good supply chain sources.
[1:14:54.680 --> 1:15:06.680]  He says that next year's phone which you know would according to plans be or to tradition be the iPhone 7 is going to be as thin as the iPhone iPod touches.
[1:15:06.680 --> 1:15:18.680]  That's actually been that's actually been the case all along it maybe not exactly to the 10th of a millimeter but at least in general every you know the way that after the first round the.
[1:15:18.680 --> 1:15:36.680]  The actually even from the original even the original iPod touch was thinner than the iPhone iPhones have always gotten next generation iPhones have always been as thick as the iPod touches that came out before like the current iPhone 6 is as thin as the iPod touch.
[1:15:36.680 --> 1:15:45.680]  And so when the iPod touch the current design came out you know the one that originally came with the wristband wrist strap attachment.
[1:15:45.680 --> 1:15:51.680]  That was when the iPhone 5 came out.
[1:15:51.680 --> 1:16:01.680]  And I remember I've said this before I was I remember it was the so the iPhone 5 came out and was really nice I think I'd still like my favorite hardware design.
[1:16:01.680 --> 1:16:17.680]  Really really nice but it came out alongside those iPod touches and I remember at the press event I was hanging around with MGC dealer and we that the table with the iPhones was super crowded 3 deep everybody wanted to and and.
[1:16:17.680 --> 1:16:36.680]  And so when you read these reports and like from home of people at the press people at this event and they're showing pictures from the hands on area.
[1:16:36.680 --> 1:16:50.680]  They're usually good photos and the people taking the photos are pretty good at framing. But it's it's actually behind the scenes there if you're there it's actually really like it has a lot of.
[1:16:50.680 --> 1:17:12.680]  Jostling to get everybody else's hands out of the way you know so that they can get a shot of just the phone and make it look nice and you know it's actually it really it's it I don't know I just wait I wait until you know it clears out and then I go over on so MGN I went over to the iPod table because it was you know mostly clear.
[1:17:12.680 --> 1:17:26.680]  And we had spent a couple seconds with the iPhone 5 and we're both excited about it looks really nice and we looked at this iPod and we're like holy crap is this thin this blow you know we didn't even we didn't even get to use the new iPhone 5 yet.
[1:17:26.680 --> 1:17:34.680]  And we were already like kind of disappointed by how thick it was because these iPods are so amazing that and that but that's how thin the iPhone 6 was 2 years later.
[1:17:34.680 --> 1:17:44.680]  And so it's always been the case and now the here Ming Chi Quo is saying that next year's is going to be as you know even thinner.
[1:17:44.680 --> 1:17:52.680]  And so I you know that's the way Apple rolls but I'm with you I would rather have them just say just this is thin enough and just fill it with battery.
[1:17:52.680 --> 1:18:12.680]  Well I'm actually not in that camp and well not necessarily I get enough battery life I don't go anywhere for them I have enough battery life to get through the day and then I recharge it with the watch so I don't usually have much of a problem and if I do go someplace I'm usually driving my car I just plug it into the car.
[1:18:12.680 --> 1:18:22.680]  And I will say I don't feel strongly about it because I'm trying to remember the last time my phone died before the end of the day and it might.
[1:18:22.680 --> 1:18:29.680]  It might actually be the case that it was a previous iPhone that I've never once not gotten through the day last year with my iPhone 6.
[1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:50.680]  I think I think the problem is more the incidences I have that are somehow software cause because occasionally the phone will just inexplicably start losing battery life like crazy like one day I'll wake up and it'll just be much draining much faster than it did the previous day for no apparent reason.
[1:18:50.680 --> 1:18:59.680]  And usually just rebooting the phone clears it up or it clears up on its own for some reason that I haven't been able to fathom.
[1:18:59.680 --> 1:19:26.680]  So I think I don't know if it's managing processes better or what it is but there's some software related thing that's more the problem than the battery size.
[1:19:26.680 --> 1:19:37.680]  I don't feel strongly about it.
[1:19:37.680 --> 1:19:41.680]  So but you do think you think it apples right to keep making them better.
[1:19:41.680 --> 1:19:59.680]  Well, I wouldn't, I don't know, I mean, I, I would think what would be right is what hits the more the more most users and I don't really know which which one that is.
[1:19:59.680 --> 1:20:17.680]  I mean, I feel like the six is thin enough. I want it to be smaller across, but I'm not going to get that this year doesn't look like.
[1:20:17.680 --> 1:20:22.680]  I asked Shiller about that on stage right. I'm not misremembering that because if I didn't I wanted to.
[1:20:22.680 --> 1:20:36.680]  The battery, the battery thing. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I think you did. Yeah. And I seem to recall his answer was it wasn't really a concrete look. There's a X, XYZ therefore they get there.
[1:20:36.680 --> 1:20:41.680]  It's more or less, you know, we're trying to do both.
[1:20:41.680 --> 1:20:50.680]  Well, no, I think it was a very polite way of saying that I was wrong and I believe him. You know, I mean, like they know, like he's got access to information that I don't have.
[1:20:50.680 --> 1:21:00.680]  And I do think part of it too is it is a factor. It's a lust factor, right, which is, look, they're in the business of selling new iPhones.
[1:21:00.680 --> 1:21:09.680]  That's the business, right. And part of that, a huge part of that is to keep iPhone users happy so that they come back and buy another one.
[1:21:09.680 --> 1:21:25.680]  And so obviously that it is a balancing act because they don't want to make it so crazy thin that everybody's batteries die. In which case, you know, people would be it would be a very likely reason that would make someone switch is if they really felt like their battery was dying every day.
[1:21:25.680 --> 1:21:28.680]  So they definitely want to avoid that.
[1:21:28.680 --> 1:21:39.680]  But I think a huge factor though is that showroom appeal, right, that you're in the, you go in the Apple store and you think maybe I'll buy a new iPhone and then you see it and it fills your heart with that lust.
[1:21:39.680 --> 1:21:44.680]  And then all of a sudden you're walking, you don't even remember what happened, you're walking out and you have a new iPhone.
[1:21:44.680 --> 1:22:00.680]  And the batteries dream to ready. That's obviously that is that's that's part of the appeal, right. The guy is dead by the time you get to the car.
[1:22:00.680 --> 1:22:17.680]  Right. I have seen the right. I don't remember the phones. Oh, it's just a piece of glass. It was just glass. It just a piece of glass. And when you, you know, it's like clear when it's off and you turn it on and the screen fills up that it was like insane, you know, literally could not be thinner.
[1:22:17.680 --> 1:22:25.680]  Right. You wouldn't want it then unless it was like paper like it couldn't be thinner unless it was more like an index card than glass.
[1:22:25.680 --> 1:22:34.680]  I think, you know, clearly that's where we're heading. I don't know how we get there. But, you know, thinner is is unavoidable.
[1:22:34.680 --> 1:22:46.680]  I guess what I would say is I think Apple maybe should just if I were if they wanted my advice, maybe dial back on that a little bit in favor of battery life.
[1:22:46.680 --> 1:22:56.680]  So anyway, we're going to be talking about new iPhones. Force touch 3D display, touch display. Better camera.
[1:22:56.680 --> 1:23:08.680]  So my thought too, I've said this before, but my thought if my dream comes true and the taps you feel them when you press, it would be that that you can actually feel the keyboard when you're typing.
[1:23:08.680 --> 1:23:18.680]  Like, again, that sounds to me too good to be true. But boy, that would be cool if they pulled that off. That would be.
[1:23:18.680 --> 1:23:29.680]  Yeah, that seems awful fine. Right. Right. And really fast, right. Because it would have to, you know, it to be useful at all. It would have to have like no latency.
[1:23:29.680 --> 1:23:43.680]  Have you ever used an Android phone that vibrates when you type? No. Yeah, I've, I think my Nexus, whatever. I don't have the like latest and greatest Nexus. I have like a year old Nexus that I bought.
[1:23:43.680 --> 1:23:53.680]  You know, just a, or no, no, I didn't buy the Nexus. I bought the Motorola one with the wooden back, whatever it's called. I don't remember.
[1:23:53.680 --> 1:24:03.680]  It, when you type on it, it's an option. You can obviously turn it off. When you type on it, it vibrates like with each tap. And it does a very good job of not falling behind.
[1:24:03.680 --> 1:24:17.680]  But I, I just don't find it to be useful. I don't know why. But if the, but if it was localized right where if it felt like I was actually clicking the key screen, that would be, that would be awesome.
[1:24:17.680 --> 1:24:21.680]  I don't think that's possible. I sure hope so.
[1:24:21.680 --> 1:24:28.680]  What else is coming out with the phone? Oh, why, why do I think they made it thicker? I guess we covered them.
[1:24:28.680 --> 1:24:38.680]  Did you see the report? Did you see the video where the one guy, the baseball cap guy? You know, I mean, it's like the unbox Joe.
[1:24:38.680 --> 1:24:45.680]  I think his name is unbox Joe. He's a YouTuber. And he always wears a baseball cap backwards.
[1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:55.680]  And he's the guy who kind of got the whole Ben Gate thing role in last year. When he bent, he's the guy who bent the phone with his hands.
[1:24:55.680 --> 1:25:06.680]  Somehow he procured what it was claimed to be a iPhone 6S frame, just the aluminum part.
[1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:17.680]  And he had a very, you know, I'm, I'm kind of ripping on him here, but he had a really good video where he took it to like a serious like, you know, engineering shop.
[1:25:17.680 --> 1:25:27.680]  And they like tested the, they use some kind of fancy equipment to test the aluminum and sort of prove that it's like a, it's like a new, like 7,000 series aluminum.
[1:25:27.680 --> 1:25:29.680]  Right. Right.
[1:25:29.680 --> 1:25:33.680]  I had heard that part. I had heard that part, but I did not know that came from there.
[1:25:33.680 --> 1:25:36.680]  Yeah.
[1:25:36.680 --> 1:25:38.680]  Unbox therapy is his name.
[1:25:38.680 --> 1:25:39.680]  Okay.
[1:25:39.680 --> 1:25:45.680]  And that's kind of, I mean, they did that with the improved the materials between the five and the five S as well.
[1:25:45.680 --> 1:25:46.680]  Yeah, I think so too.
[1:25:46.680 --> 1:25:52.680]  But yeah, because my five, my head, I had the space gray five scratch to hell.
[1:25:52.680 --> 1:25:55.680]  But not so with the space gray five S.
[1:25:55.680 --> 1:26:00.680]  Yeah. So he, I'll put that in the show notes, hopefully.
[1:26:00.680 --> 1:26:05.680]  But yeah, unbox therapy has an interesting video and it, it almost certainly is a legit.
[1:26:05.680 --> 1:26:11.680]  I don't know how this stuff, you know, somebody smoked it out of a factory in Foxconn and somehow sent it to him.
[1:26:11.680 --> 1:26:16.680]  And, but he also stress tested it and like measured how many foot pounds of force takes to actually bend the frame.
[1:26:16.680 --> 1:26:23.680]  And it's like enormously more durable than what than the iPhone six and six plus.
[1:26:23.680 --> 1:26:26.680]  I hope the iPad pros made out of the same stuff.
[1:26:26.680 --> 1:26:31.680]  I want to, you've been like crazy, right?
[1:26:31.680 --> 1:26:34.680]  What else?
[1:26:34.680 --> 1:26:45.680]  Gurman says that they're going to keep both the six and the six plus in the lineup, you know, that, which I think makes sense.
[1:26:45.680 --> 1:26:52.680]  I think, you know, and it's also widely reported, you know, because there's none of these supply chain links.
[1:26:52.680 --> 1:27:02.680]  It's, it's almost the lack of, of, of weeks of a six C plastic six C, which you and I were thinking they would do.
[1:27:02.680 --> 1:27:08.680]  When we took public hoping they would do, but I've given up all hope on that because clear, I mean, there's no way they're going to do that.
[1:27:08.680 --> 1:27:09.680]  Yeah.
[1:27:09.680 --> 1:27:16.680]  I think they're going to do the most obvious thing possible, which is what they've done every other year other than that five C year is just move last year's phone down.
[1:27:16.680 --> 1:27:28.680]  And the fact that there were two last year, it just means there's two now this year, you know, and that you can choose the 4.7 inch or the 5.5 inch and whatever.
[1:27:28.680 --> 1:27:32.680]  Well, maybe next year.
[1:27:32.680 --> 1:27:33.680]  Yeah.
[1:27:33.680 --> 1:27:34.680]  I don't think so.
[1:27:34.680 --> 1:27:36.680]  You don't think even next year, really?
[1:27:36.680 --> 1:27:37.680]  Yeah, I've come around.
[1:27:37.680 --> 1:27:38.680]  I've changed my mind.
[1:27:38.680 --> 1:27:42.680]  I think that the four inch phones are gone forever.
[1:27:42.680 --> 1:27:51.680]  Well, there was, there was even a rumor though that that they were, I mean, this was just like a prototype, but they had a 3.5 inch phone that they were working on.
[1:27:51.680 --> 1:27:52.680]  I heard that.
[1:27:52.680 --> 1:27:53.680]  I'm surprised.
[1:27:53.680 --> 1:27:55.680]  I don't think so though.
[1:27:55.680 --> 1:27:57.680]  I just don't, I don't, I don't seem doing that.
[1:27:57.680 --> 1:28:03.680]  I, I'm not surprised that they tinkered with it, but I don't know.
[1:28:03.680 --> 1:28:05.680]  I just kind of my gut feeling now.
[1:28:05.680 --> 1:28:06.680]  I hope I'm wrong.
[1:28:06.680 --> 1:28:07.680]  I do.
[1:28:07.680 --> 1:28:12.680]  I do hope I'm wrong and I would love to see them come out with a new 4 inch phone or even smaller.
[1:28:12.680 --> 1:28:18.680]  I probably would not buy smaller, but I would be very tempted to buy a new 4 inch one that had good specs, but.
[1:28:18.680 --> 1:28:24.680]  If I could get this year's specs and a 4 inch phone, I would definitely get the 4 inch phone over over the 4.7.
[1:28:24.680 --> 1:28:24.680]  Right.
[1:28:24.680 --> 1:28:25.680]  I wouldn't hesitate either.
[1:28:25.680 --> 1:28:26.680]  I would definitely do it.
[1:28:26.680 --> 1:28:31.680]  But I think the problem that I will would obviously be that you won't get this year's specs you get last years.
[1:28:31.680 --> 1:28:32.680]  Yeah.
[1:28:32.680 --> 1:28:38.680]  The best that we could hope for is to, to get it to, you know, get like the equivalent of a 5c.
[1:28:38.680 --> 1:28:39.680]  Right.
[1:28:39.680 --> 1:28:42.680]  A last year's specs in a smaller size.
[1:28:42.680 --> 1:28:48.680]  They got a new, they're supposedly a new rose gold color.
[1:28:48.680 --> 1:28:50.680]  I don't really care.
[1:28:50.680 --> 1:28:51.680]  Yeah.
[1:28:51.680 --> 1:28:53.680]  I'm not surprised.
[1:28:53.680 --> 1:29:00.680]  The only time, the only time that I have been tempted by or actually thought that I should have gotten a different color was the.
[1:29:00.680 --> 1:29:02.680]  Five.
[1:29:02.680 --> 1:29:05.680]  Partly because like I said, the space gray one.
[1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:06.680]  Like crazy.
[1:29:06.680 --> 1:29:07.680]  Yeah.
[1:29:07.680 --> 1:29:11.680]  And I also just really liked that shape in the white color.
[1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:12.680]  Yeah.
[1:29:12.680 --> 1:29:18.680]  But I know we're repeating ourselves here, but I, but the space gray one that nicked really easily.
[1:29:18.680 --> 1:29:21.680]  The first couple of nicks annoyed me.
[1:29:21.680 --> 1:29:25.680]  And then once it kind of all got scuffed up, I thought it really looked good.
[1:29:25.680 --> 1:29:28.680]  Like in a Star Wars, you know, beat up.
[1:29:28.680 --> 1:29:30.680]  You know, you know what I mean?
[1:29:30.680 --> 1:29:36.680]  I thought it, you know, like in a way that, that your genes look good after you, you know, warn them a couple times, you know.
[1:29:36.680 --> 1:29:37.680]  I don't know.
[1:29:37.680 --> 1:29:40.680]  I thought it had like a cool, I got, you know, I don't know.
[1:29:40.680 --> 1:29:48.680]  I'm sure somebody's apple is, is dying hearing that because they may not, may not look like much, but just gotta work out.
[1:29:48.680 --> 1:29:51.680]  I don't, I don't know that apple was shooting for, it looks good.
[1:29:51.680 --> 1:29:53.680]  No, I don't think so either.
[1:29:53.680 --> 1:29:58.680]  But, you know, but my, I still got my original iPhones in there.
[1:29:58.680 --> 1:29:59.680]  Dang, it's like crazy too.
[1:29:59.680 --> 1:30:01.680]  Scuffed and.
[1:30:01.680 --> 1:30:05.680]  What else with iPhones or anything else with iPhone that we expect?
[1:30:05.680 --> 1:30:06.680]  I don't think so.
[1:30:06.680 --> 1:30:09.680]  I mean, I think the big stuff is other things, right?
[1:30:09.680 --> 1:30:10.680]  I mean, this is the talkier.
[1:30:10.680 --> 1:30:18.680]  So it's going to be same form factor and just like, you know, possibly the, the Siri this year is the force touch stuff.
[1:30:18.680 --> 1:30:20.680]  Yeah, that's what I think.
[1:30:20.680 --> 1:30:27.680]  I guess a wildcard would be whether there's like a serious big worth bragging about improvement to the camera.
[1:30:27.680 --> 1:30:29.680]  But I'm not really expecting that.
[1:30:29.680 --> 1:30:34.680]  I just feel like, you know, there'll be some kind of improvement whether it's megapixels or something.
[1:30:34.680 --> 1:30:38.680]  But I don't think it'll be like a, a greatly forward.
[1:30:38.680 --> 1:30:39.680]  Yeah.
[1:30:39.680 --> 1:30:49.680]  I talked a month ago, maybe even a year ago where I had heard from as they say a little birdie that Apple was working on a thing with a two camera system.
[1:30:49.680 --> 1:30:51.680]  Which I don't really understand the physics of.
[1:30:51.680 --> 1:30:54.680]  And I've read some pieces from people speculating about how that would work.
[1:30:54.680 --> 1:30:55.680]  And it is fascinating to me.
[1:30:55.680 --> 1:31:01.680]  But the basic gist is that there'd be a camera, a camera that has two lenses right next to each other.
[1:31:01.680 --> 1:31:09.680]  So sort of like, sort of like, I guess it'd be closer though, but like it would just be two circles right next to each other.
[1:31:09.680 --> 1:31:14.680]  And that somehow it's like one is focusing far and one's focusing near.
[1:31:14.680 --> 1:31:19.680]  And then somehow it gives amazing results in the resulting image.
[1:31:19.680 --> 1:31:21.680]  Like SLR quality photos.
[1:31:21.680 --> 1:31:24.680]  And I think I wrote about it, not podcasted about it.
[1:31:24.680 --> 1:31:27.680]  And I said the next iPhone.
[1:31:27.680 --> 1:31:30.680]  And I didn't mean this year's.
[1:31:30.680 --> 1:31:32.680]  I didn't mean that it was, that it was something for the success.
[1:31:32.680 --> 1:31:35.680]  I meant the next iPhone like the next iPhone form factor.
[1:31:35.680 --> 1:31:39.680]  Because I don't think that that sort of thing they would ever do in the S year.
[1:31:39.680 --> 1:31:43.680]  Because it would break like the rules of, you know, the S year.
[1:31:43.680 --> 1:31:49.680]  Like the S year rules are that it's, the phone's supposed to fit in last year's cases.
[1:31:49.680 --> 1:31:50.680]  Yeah.
[1:31:50.680 --> 1:31:55.680]  Which I guess is interesting if it is thicker, like you said, like how many cases will still fit the phone?
[1:31:55.680 --> 1:31:56.680]  That's interesting.
[1:31:56.680 --> 1:31:59.680]  Well, they see having german seem to think that it should still fit all of it.
[1:31:59.680 --> 1:32:01.680]  Yeah, because it's not that much thicker.
[1:32:01.680 --> 1:32:06.680]  Yeah, it sounds like it's, you know, like, like the difference in thickness.
[1:32:06.680 --> 1:32:08.680]  You really would have to like take out calipers and measure it.
[1:32:08.680 --> 1:32:09.680]  Yeah.
[1:32:09.680 --> 1:32:12.680]  Probably couldn't do it with your, with your hands.
[1:32:12.680 --> 1:32:17.680]  Do you, do you think they're going to have trouble blowing past last year's numbers?
[1:32:17.680 --> 1:32:19.680]  Because last year's numbers were so huge.
[1:32:19.680 --> 1:32:25.680]  And because they had the pent up demand for people who wanted a larger phone.
[1:32:25.680 --> 1:32:27.680]  I, I think that that's probably true.
[1:32:27.680 --> 1:32:32.680]  I think, and I, I just feel like the anecdotal explanation that you just gave.
[1:32:32.680 --> 1:32:39.680]  Just a basic, you know, lots of people had heard that they were going to do a bigger phone.
[1:32:39.680 --> 1:32:44.680]  For a long enough, you know, like that rumor was, it was over a year old.
[1:32:44.680 --> 1:32:45.680]  And, you know, it's weird.
[1:32:45.680 --> 1:32:49.680]  It's weird the way that like regular people know that Apple rumors now.
[1:32:49.680 --> 1:32:53.680]  You know, because people would ask me, you know, if a lot of events is Apple really going to do a bigger phone.
[1:32:53.680 --> 1:32:58.680]  And the fact that people were asking me that was like, wow, that people really do want bigger phones.
[1:32:58.680 --> 1:33:07.680]  And I think you're right that there's an awful lot of people who put off buying an iPhone that overly inflated last year's iPhone sales.
[1:33:07.680 --> 1:33:09.680]  Yeah.
[1:33:09.680 --> 1:33:17.680]  And I think, I think people held off long enough that it's not the kind of thing where the contract is going to be.
[1:33:17.680 --> 1:33:18.680]  Yeah.
[1:33:18.680 --> 1:33:21.680]  The issue, like, so it's not like, okay, well, yeah.
[1:33:21.680 --> 1:33:26.680]  But those people last year, but there's a whole set of new people who just came off contract for this year.
[1:33:26.680 --> 1:33:31.680]  Yeah, I also think that there might be, it might be tough to, to meet the sales that they didn't China.
[1:33:31.680 --> 1:33:34.680]  I don't know, though, because it's like they're growing so fast and trying.
[1:33:34.680 --> 1:33:39.680]  But it felt like last year was the year they were, were, where they really exploded in China.
[1:33:39.680 --> 1:33:44.680]  And that if there was pent up demand, they sold crazy big numbers to meet them.
[1:33:44.680 --> 1:33:46.680]  And that they might have trouble doing that.
[1:33:46.680 --> 1:33:56.680]  But maybe I'm underestimating just how many, just how many truly like maybe like tens of millions of first time iPhone buyers that are going to expand and.
[1:33:56.680 --> 1:33:59.680]  Yeah, that's what, that's kind of what I think will happen.
[1:33:59.680 --> 1:34:05.680]  The economy there is, is a concern, but it seems like they, they haven't talked out there yet.
[1:34:05.680 --> 1:34:10.680]  Like, they're, they did run up past Xiaomi, right?
[1:34:10.680 --> 1:34:11.680]  Yeah.
[1:34:11.680 --> 1:34:25.680]  Like in the second quarter, I want to say, but, but they're still, they were still, I mean, they, they had good growth, but they weren't big enough in China to that point where they've actually like, is saturated it.
[1:34:25.680 --> 1:34:30.680]  Yeah, and the weird thing to about the economy being weak is that.
[1:34:30.680 --> 1:34:40.680]  I think it might affect everything other than phones first because phones have turned into this weird thing that everybody who has one thinks is essential, right?
[1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:48.680]  Like, so the economy goes bad and like, vacation resorts suffer because like, that's one thing people do.
[1:34:48.680 --> 1:34:58.680]  Like, if, you know, they're, their investments have gone down or, you know, if you're taking a pay cut or if you're like a small business owner in the businesses down, you cut back on vacations, right?
[1:34:58.680 --> 1:35:05.680]  Or you cut back on jewelry or, you know, all sorts of things that when the economy goes bad definitely suffer.
[1:35:05.680 --> 1:35:16.680]  But I feel like phones maybe, or maybe not immune to it, but are strong resistance to it because people, even if the economy's bad and you're cutting back in other areas, if you need a new phone, you're still getting a new phone.
[1:35:16.680 --> 1:35:19.680]  And if you're going to get a new phone, you're going to get the one you want.
[1:35:19.680 --> 1:35:20.680]  Yeah.
[1:35:20.680 --> 1:35:21.680]  I think.
[1:35:21.680 --> 1:35:22.680]  So I don't know.
[1:35:22.680 --> 1:35:33.680]  I feel like the, you know, and I, you know, I thought it was really, really telling that Tim Cook had that public statement, you know, to, what's the name, Jimmy Kramer on CNBC, the other, the other week.
[1:35:33.680 --> 1:35:38.680]  That's going to, he's going to jail because of that.
[1:35:38.680 --> 1:35:41.680]  So I guess there was a concern he could get, he could get fined.
[1:35:41.680 --> 1:35:46.680]  I don't know. You know, Tim Cook seems like such a cautious person like Steve Jobs.
[1:35:46.680 --> 1:35:56.680]  It was the type of person who, if he wanted to do it was going to do it and then they figure out the, you know, like, and infamously, you know, really did get into trouble with the, the backdating of the stock options.
[1:35:56.680 --> 1:35:57.680]  Right.
[1:35:57.680 --> 1:35:57.680]  Right.
[1:35:57.680 --> 1:35:59.680]  I was, I guess, you know, that was pretty bad.
[1:35:59.680 --> 1:36:01.680]  Tim Cook is so deliberate.
[1:36:01.680 --> 1:36:10.680]  Or at least he seems to be that I would, I would be very surprised if that hadn't been vetted by apples, you know, like,
[1:36:10.680 --> 1:36:13.680]  like SEC compliance lawyers.
[1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:25.680]  Like, it just seems to me like, from what I can tell if Tim Cook's personality, that if he wanted to do that, he called up, you know, whether it was their general counsel, you know,
[1:36:25.680 --> 1:36:29.680]  it would probably just called the general counsel guy and then said, here's what I want to do.
[1:36:29.680 --> 1:36:33.680]  Let me, you know, here's the, you know, here's the exact thing I want to email Jim Kramer.
[1:36:33.680 --> 1:36:36.680]  I want to do it tomorrow and I am, is this okay?
[1:36:36.680 --> 1:36:38.680]  I would be very surprised if he didn't do that.
[1:36:38.680 --> 1:36:42.680]  Now, just because one lawyer at apples looks at it says, yeah, that's fine.
[1:36:42.680 --> 1:36:48.680]  That doesn't mean, you know, there's been a lot of cases where, you know, one lawyer saying it's okay, doesn't mean that it's good.
[1:36:48.680 --> 1:36:51.680]  But I haven't seen anything that anybody's looking into it, right?
[1:36:51.680 --> 1:36:53.680]  I saw it's just idle speculation that, right?
[1:36:53.680 --> 1:36:54.680]  Right.
[1:36:54.680 --> 1:36:56.680]  Right.
[1:36:56.680 --> 1:36:57.680]  What's the gist of the rule?
[1:36:57.680 --> 1:37:00.680]  The gist of the rule is, it's just, yeah, I don't know.
[1:37:00.680 --> 1:37:02.680]  I don't know, but just, yeah, I don't know.
[1:37:02.680 --> 1:37:07.680]  Something, something about giving information, any information that you give that would be.
[1:37:07.680 --> 1:37:12.680]  Of interest to some investors, you have to give to all of them.
[1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:13.680]  Right.
[1:37:13.680 --> 1:37:14.680]  Right.
[1:37:14.680 --> 1:37:15.680]  So that, you know, there's certain.
[1:37:15.680 --> 1:37:16.680]  That sounds, that sounds right.
[1:37:16.680 --> 1:37:17.680]  Yeah, sure.
[1:37:17.680 --> 1:37:18.680]  Right.
[1:37:18.680 --> 1:37:24.680]  So, you know, obviously the worst example would be if Tim Cook just called Jim Kramer up on the phone.
[1:37:24.680 --> 1:37:26.680]  It's just between me and you.
[1:37:26.680 --> 1:37:28.680]  Well, well, yeah, okay.
[1:37:28.680 --> 1:37:29.680]  Right.
[1:37:29.680 --> 1:37:30.680]  Right.
[1:37:30.680 --> 1:37:31.680]  You know, it's unlikely.
[1:37:31.680 --> 1:37:36.680]  I mean, Jim Kramer is a, you know, he's not a journalist really, but he's a guy who does, who talks about this stuff.
[1:37:36.680 --> 1:37:37.680]  And a show.
[1:37:37.680 --> 1:37:43.680]  So, if I think talking to him, it seems like he's, the, the point is actually to get it out there.
[1:37:43.680 --> 1:37:45.680]  It's what's worse is when you call your buddy.
[1:37:45.680 --> 1:37:46.680]  Yeah.
[1:37:46.680 --> 1:37:47.680]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:37:47.680 --> 1:37:48.680]  Your friend.
[1:37:48.680 --> 1:37:49.680]  Yeah.
[1:37:49.680 --> 1:37:50.680]  Yeah.
[1:37:50.680 --> 1:37:54.680]  So obviously that's what it's meant to, to, to, to, to, that's what the laws in place for.
[1:37:54.680 --> 1:38:01.680]  But that there's people who've gotten in trouble for, I didn't the Netflix CEO getting trouble for,
[1:38:01.680 --> 1:38:08.680]  like a blog post where he posted stuff, because blog post wasn't officially or maybe like a tweet or something.
[1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:09.680]  Oh.
[1:38:09.680 --> 1:38:12.680]  You know, that sounds, that sounds vaguely familiar.
[1:38:12.680 --> 1:38:13.680]  Yeah.
[1:38:13.680 --> 1:38:15.680]  But why would a tweet not be?
[1:38:15.680 --> 1:38:16.680]  I forget what it is.
[1:38:16.680 --> 1:38:20.680]  But it, well, that somehow that it, it, there's certain forms.
[1:38:20.680 --> 1:38:21.680]  Wasn't reaching it.
[1:38:21.680 --> 1:38:23.680]  It wasn't considered public or something.
[1:38:23.680 --> 1:38:24.680]  Right.
[1:38:24.680 --> 1:38:25.680]  Like opt in to follow it.
[1:38:25.680 --> 1:38:26.680]  Right.
[1:38:26.680 --> 1:38:31.680]  But press release that goes out on the official press wire, which is weird because it's actually,
[1:38:31.680 --> 1:38:36.680]  that's actually something that, you know, normal people don't access, but all of the media do.
[1:38:36.680 --> 1:38:39.680]  And it's assumed then that everybody is equal access to the media.
[1:38:39.680 --> 1:38:42.680]  Somehow that, you know, but that's okay.
[1:38:42.680 --> 1:38:48.680]  It's just that, like, tweets had never been, uh, okay by the SEC before.
[1:38:48.680 --> 1:38:49.680]  Yeah.
[1:38:49.680 --> 1:38:54.680]  And that they were speaking well, only, you know, certain people have access to Twitter because you have to have a cell phone and whatever.
[1:38:54.680 --> 1:38:56.680]  They just didn't get it.
[1:38:56.680 --> 1:38:59.680]  Yeah.
[1:38:59.680 --> 1:39:01.680]  So do you want to talk about the Apple TV?
[1:39:01.680 --> 1:39:02.680]  Uh, I do.
[1:39:02.680 --> 1:39:06.680]  But I, I should take a break here and thank another one of our, our friends.
[1:39:06.680 --> 1:39:11.680]  And this time it is our good friend, um, automatic.
[1:39:11.680 --> 1:39:16.680]  These are the guys who make that the connected car adapter.
[1:39:16.680 --> 1:39:17.680]  It's a little dongle.
[1:39:17.680 --> 1:39:18.680]  I love saying that word.
[1:39:18.680 --> 1:39:21.680]  Um, it plugs into your car's diagnostic port.
[1:39:21.680 --> 1:39:25.680]  Uh, I think it's like every car since like 1997, but it's somewhere around there.
[1:39:25.680 --> 1:39:28.680]  It's like every car of recent vintage has one of these ports.
[1:39:28.680 --> 1:39:31.680]  And it's a standard port, which is really kind of cool.
[1:39:31.680 --> 1:39:35.680]  Um, you know, like the way that like USB is a standard port and a DMI is a standard port.
[1:39:35.680 --> 1:39:37.680]  Well, there's a car diagnostic port.
[1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:40.680]  It's like underneath the dashboard somewhere on your car.
[1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:48.680]  Um, and that's when you go to, uh, like your dealer or to the mechanic, you know, and like when your car has like a thing that lights up and says like,
[1:39:48.680 --> 1:39:51.680]  uh, you need, you're due for service A2.
[1:39:51.680 --> 1:39:54.680]  Uh, you go in there, they, that's what they plug their stuff into.
[1:39:54.680 --> 1:39:59.680]  And then it tells them, you know, what it's saying that, you know, your oil filter needs replacement or whatever.
[1:39:59.680 --> 1:40:01.680]  Well, you can access that too.
[1:40:01.680 --> 1:40:03.680]  That's, you know, and that's what automatic is for.
[1:40:03.680 --> 1:40:04.680]  It's just really cool thing.
[1:40:04.680 --> 1:40:07.680]  You just plug it into that diagnostic port.
[1:40:07.680 --> 1:40:12.680]  And then it uses Bluetooth to, you know, talk to their app, which is on your iPhone.
[1:40:12.680 --> 1:40:17.680]  Um, and it just tells you, so if you ever get one of those weird things like service, you know,
[1:40:17.680 --> 1:40:20.680]  A5, or I don't even know what the things are.
[1:40:20.680 --> 1:40:22.680]  Uh, and you're worried like what the hell does that mean?
[1:40:22.680 --> 1:40:25.680]  Is that, you know, routine is, is my car ready to break it.
[1:40:25.680 --> 1:40:28.680]  Automatic will explain to you in plain English exactly what's going on.
[1:40:28.680 --> 1:40:33.680]  And it even lets you clear the light if, if you want to, so you don't have to get annoyed by that every time you start the car up.
[1:40:33.680 --> 1:40:34.680]  Really cool.
[1:40:34.680 --> 1:40:37.680]  Uh, gives you a log of your trips.
[1:40:37.680 --> 1:40:44.680]  Uh, it uses, uh, the GPS on your phone so that when, uh, you get out of your car, it will remember where you were parked.
[1:40:44.680 --> 1:40:49.680]  Um, it's like anything, it just turns your car into a smart car.
[1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:50.680]  Really, really cool.
[1:40:50.680 --> 1:40:53.680]  Uh, even, it can even score you on your driving.
[1:40:53.680 --> 1:40:59.680]  Uh, so if you're like me and you have a lead foot, it'll just tell you, boy, you, you know, you drive in too fast, John.
[1:40:59.680 --> 1:41:01.680]  I mean, that's really what it'll do.
[1:41:01.680 --> 1:41:08.680]  Uh, you can tell you how kind of mileage you're getting tells you if you drive in a style that's, uh, you know, getting a good mileage.
[1:41:08.680 --> 1:41:10.680]  Uh, just amazingly cool stuff.
[1:41:10.680 --> 1:41:14.680]  So they've added a new thing, they're calling it the app store for your car.
[1:41:14.680 --> 1:41:17.680]  Um, and there's over 20 apps that are available within, uh, their thing.
[1:41:17.680 --> 1:41:21.680]  And it allows you to use your car's data in all kinds of ways.
[1:41:21.680 --> 1:41:24.680]  So you can hook it up to nest so that you're thermostat.
[1:41:24.680 --> 1:41:27.680]  I mean, this is like, seriously, it's like science fiction stuff.
[1:41:27.680 --> 1:41:32.680]  You can have your air conditioning turn on when you get within, you know, five miles of your house or whatever you want.
[1:41:32.680 --> 1:41:35.680]  Uh, amazing stuff like that if you have nest.
[1:41:35.680 --> 1:41:39.680]  Uh, if this, then that integration with all sorts of ways to, to let you do,
[1:41:39.680 --> 1:41:44.680]  to let you do stuff based automatically on this smart information coming out of your car.
[1:41:44.680 --> 1:41:46.680]  Just really great.
[1:41:46.680 --> 1:41:47.680]  Really fun.
[1:41:47.680 --> 1:41:51.680]  It seems like something that ought to be built into your cars, but it's actually kind of cool that you can do it with automatic.
[1:41:51.680 --> 1:41:52.680]  It's a standard port.
[1:41:52.680 --> 1:41:57.680]  So you don't have to like depend on like your car maker making an app for your phone.
[1:41:57.680 --> 1:41:58.680]  You just use automatics.
[1:41:58.680 --> 1:41:59.680]  And it's really good.
[1:41:59.680 --> 1:42:00.680]  These guys know what they're doing.
[1:42:00.680 --> 1:42:02.680]  It's really good design and everything like that.
[1:42:02.680 --> 1:42:05.680]  Um, sounds too good to be true almost, but it's, it's great.
[1:42:05.680 --> 1:42:06.680]  I think it's really cool.
[1:42:06.680 --> 1:42:10.680]  You can check out the apps at automatic.com slash apps.
[1:42:10.680 --> 1:42:12.680]  Uh, you want to buy it.
[1:42:12.680 --> 1:42:13.680]  Here's the thing.
[1:42:13.680 --> 1:42:14.680]  It's just a hundred bucks.
[1:42:14.680 --> 1:42:16.680]  $99.95.

[1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:44.680]  I don't like it.
[1:42:44.680 --> 1:42:45.680]  It's nonsense.
[1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:46.680]  You just send it back.
[1:42:46.680 --> 1:42:47.680]  You get your money back.
[1:42:47.680 --> 1:42:48.680]  Nobody's going to do that because it's cool.

[1:42:50.680 --> 1:42:52.680]  it's like you've got kit.
[1:42:52.680 --> 1:42:55.680]  Uh, well, except for the power boost thing.
[1:42:55.680 --> 1:42:56.680]  It doesn't, it doesn't give you that.

[1:43:07.680 --> 1:43:11.680]  Um, so what else?
[1:43:11.680 --> 1:43:14.680]  Do you think there's going to be a Apple TV tomorrow?
[1:43:14.680 --> 1:43:15.680]  Not tomorrow.
[1:43:15.680 --> 1:43:16.680]  Uh, Tuesday.
[1:43:16.680 --> 1:43:17.680]  Wednesday.
[1:43:17.680 --> 1:43:18.680]  Wednesday.
[1:43:18.680 --> 1:43:20.680]  Uh, I sure sure.
[1:43:20.680 --> 1:43:23.680]  It's been five years.
[1:43:23.680 --> 1:43:26.680]  Uh, is that right?
[1:43:26.680 --> 1:43:28.680]  Remember, remember that correctly?
[1:43:28.680 --> 1:43:33.680]  I think that the one that the,
[1:43:33.680 --> 1:43:37.680]  the, the, I think the third, the third generation is later.
[1:43:37.680 --> 1:43:39.680]  Is it just five years in that form factor, maybe?
[1:43:39.680 --> 1:43:40.680]  Yeah.
[1:43:40.680 --> 1:43:42.680]  But what did the third one add?
[1:43:42.680 --> 1:43:45.680]  I know that it has faster and more memory, right?
[1:43:45.680 --> 1:43:46.680]  Yeah.
[1:43:46.680 --> 1:43:47.680]  And the second one.
[1:43:47.680 --> 1:43:49.680]  Oh, it's, it's, what is it?
[1:43:49.680 --> 1:43:50.680]  1080, 1080p.
[1:43:50.680 --> 1:43:51.680]  Yeah.
[1:43:51.680 --> 1:43:53.680]  Instead of 720.
[1:43:53.680 --> 1:43:54.680]  Yeah.
[1:43:54.680 --> 1:43:56.680]  Did, what's the old one only 720?
[1:43:56.680 --> 1:43:57.680]  I think so.
[1:43:57.680 --> 1:44:01.680]  Oh, well, that, that, that's kind of gross.
[1:44:01.680 --> 1:44:02.680]  That's what I have.
[1:44:02.680 --> 1:44:03.680]  Yeah.
[1:44:03.680 --> 1:44:05.680]  Well, I, well, no, it's funny as I have the new Apple TV,
[1:44:05.680 --> 1:44:07.680]  but I have a 720p TV set.
[1:44:07.680 --> 1:44:09.680]  Which I don't mind at all.
[1:44:09.680 --> 1:44:11.680]  I've got seven, I've got 720 eyes.
[1:44:11.680 --> 1:44:13.680]  Oh, by the way, don't,
[1:44:13.680 --> 1:44:16.680]  everybody out there don't tell my son that our TV is 720.
[1:44:16.680 --> 1:44:20.680]  Just a cage ever in the room.
[1:44:20.680 --> 1:44:24.680]  See, the thing is, I have a really, I have a,
[1:44:24.680 --> 1:44:29.680]  it's probably one of the most beloved possessions I have is,
[1:44:29.680 --> 1:44:33.680]  a pioneer plasma TV.
[1:44:33.680 --> 1:44:35.680]  And I got 720 instead of 1080.
[1:44:35.680 --> 1:44:38.680]  I don't know when I bought it in like 2006.
[1:44:38.680 --> 1:44:40.680]  It's, it's old, really.
[1:44:40.680 --> 1:44:43.680]  But I still love it because I love plasma.
[1:44:43.680 --> 1:44:45.680]  I love the color of plasma.
[1:44:45.680 --> 1:44:46.680]  And I did the math.
[1:44:46.680 --> 1:44:48.680]  I, there's like a calculator where you can,
[1:44:48.680 --> 1:44:51.680]  I got like a tape measure and measured where I sit
[1:44:51.680 --> 1:44:53.680]  and where our TV is in, in our house.
[1:44:53.680 --> 1:44:54.680]  And there's nowhere else.
[1:44:54.680 --> 1:44:56.680]  There's no way to like rearrange our TV is like,
[1:44:56.680 --> 1:44:58.680]  we've got one place where we can put a TV on our living room.
[1:44:58.680 --> 1:45:02.680]  And we were well within the range of,
[1:45:02.680 --> 1:45:06.680]  you, you will not see the difference, you know,
[1:45:06.680 --> 1:45:08.680]  between 720 and 1080.
[1:45:08.680 --> 1:45:10.680]  So I just saved the money and got the 720.
[1:45:10.680 --> 1:45:12.680]  But it seems gross.
[1:45:12.680 --> 1:45:14.680]  What seems gross to me is having an Apple TV
[1:45:14.680 --> 1:45:16.680]  that can't do 1080.
[1:45:16.680 --> 1:45:18.680]  Just the, just the thought of it.
[1:45:18.680 --> 1:45:20.680]  Well, that gross is a little long,
[1:45:20.680 --> 1:45:23.680]  but it just seems, it just seems like antiquated.
[1:45:23.680 --> 1:45:24.680]  Right.
[1:45:24.680 --> 1:45:26.680]  I mean, 1080 and the one they're in a year apart.
[1:45:26.680 --> 1:45:30.680]  So the, the most recent one was an introduced in March of 2012.
[1:45:30.680 --> 1:45:32.680]  And that prior one was March of 2011.
[1:45:32.680 --> 1:45:34.680]  So that makes not that far.
[1:45:34.680 --> 1:45:37.680]  And I know I still have the old, my second one upstairs,
[1:45:37.680 --> 1:45:39.680]  on a TV that we almost never watch,
[1:45:39.680 --> 1:45:42.680]  but it's, it doesn't have the new software update.
[1:45:42.680 --> 1:45:43.680]  It still has the old.
[1:45:43.680 --> 1:45:44.680]  It doesn't, yeah.
[1:45:44.680 --> 1:45:45.680]  Well, it doesn't take it.
[1:45:45.680 --> 1:45:46.680]  Yeah.
[1:45:46.680 --> 1:45:47.680]  Right.
[1:45:47.680 --> 1:45:50.680]  So I've got the, got the old, the old interface.
[1:45:50.680 --> 1:45:52.680]  And I had actually never even seen the new one,
[1:45:52.680 --> 1:45:53.680]  at least not in use.
[1:45:53.680 --> 1:45:54.680]  Yeah.
[1:45:54.680 --> 1:45:55.680]  It's only one over to Albert's theater night.
[1:45:55.680 --> 1:45:56.680]  So.
[1:45:56.680 --> 1:45:57.680]  Oh, yeah.
[1:45:57.680 --> 1:45:59.680]  Because yeah, of course he's got the latest and greatest.
[1:45:59.680 --> 1:46:00.680]  Yeah, sure.
[1:46:00.680 --> 1:46:01.680]  You know.
[1:46:01.680 --> 1:46:02.680]  Okay.
[1:46:02.680 --> 1:46:05.680]  I think this is, I'm really excited about this for the event.
[1:46:05.680 --> 1:46:06.680]  Me too.
[1:46:06.680 --> 1:46:08.680]  Because I'm dying for one of these forever.
[1:46:08.680 --> 1:46:09.680]  Okay.
[1:46:09.680 --> 1:46:11.680]  So we know that there's a new Apple TV.
[1:46:11.680 --> 1:46:15.680]  And we know that they're going to do, well, we don't know,
[1:46:15.680 --> 1:46:17.680]  but it's, everybody says it's going to be an app store for it.
[1:46:17.680 --> 1:46:18.680]  And a full SDK.
[1:46:18.680 --> 1:46:20.680]  And, and there's rumors about a new controller.
[1:46:20.680 --> 1:46:23.680]  And we know a little bit about the controller supposedly
[1:46:23.680 --> 1:46:26.680]  that it's like a touch pad.
[1:46:26.680 --> 1:46:28.680]  Like I guess like a Max.
[1:46:28.680 --> 1:46:29.680]  Got some physical buttons.
[1:46:29.680 --> 1:46:33.680]  And also like a, like a touch some sort of touch pad.
[1:46:33.680 --> 1:46:34.680]  Yeah.
[1:46:34.680 --> 1:46:35.680]  Like a track pad.
[1:46:35.680 --> 1:46:36.680]  So.
[1:46:36.680 --> 1:46:39.680]  It, you know, and, and by all the reports that I've seen,
[1:46:39.680 --> 1:46:43.680]  I know a lot of people for so long have said whenever we speculate
[1:46:43.680 --> 1:46:46.680]  on new Apple TVs and I've always been going on on that,
[1:46:46.680 --> 1:46:49.680]  they got to get rid of this piece of shit remote.
[1:46:49.680 --> 1:46:52.680]  They've got to do something about this goddamn remote.
[1:46:52.680 --> 1:46:55.680]  And everybody always says to me, I, I know at the new,
[1:46:55.680 --> 1:46:58.680]  the next Apple TV remote is it's going to be your iPhone.
[1:46:58.680 --> 1:47:00.680]  You just use your iPhone as the remote.
[1:47:00.680 --> 1:47:04.680]  And to me, that's, that's like a, that's a non star.
[1:47:04.680 --> 1:47:07.680]  You already can use that remote app, which I don't like.
[1:47:07.680 --> 1:47:08.680]  I know some people do.
[1:47:08.680 --> 1:47:11.680]  I just don't, I never ever use that other than when in like,
[1:47:11.680 --> 1:47:13.680]  if I have to like enter a password.
[1:47:13.680 --> 1:47:15.680]  But usually when I have to enter a password,
[1:47:15.680 --> 1:47:17.680]  it's the Wi-Fi password.
[1:47:17.680 --> 1:47:19.680]  And you can't enter the Wi-Fi password.
[1:47:19.680 --> 1:47:22.680]  That's where it is. I guess you can.
[1:47:22.680 --> 1:47:25.680]  I think they might have done something or no, it's a keyboard.
[1:47:25.680 --> 1:47:27.680]  You can do like a hook up a blue, a physical Bluetooth keyboard.
[1:47:27.680 --> 1:47:28.680]  Yes, you can, yes.
[1:47:28.680 --> 1:47:32.680]  Which is actually a cool, a cool, that's actually a cool thing if you know about it.
[1:47:32.680 --> 1:47:34.680]  So if you're setting up a new Apple, the old Apple,
[1:47:34.680 --> 1:47:36.680]  don't buy a new Apple TV right now by the way.
[1:47:36.680 --> 1:47:38.680]  But I'm buying one right now.
[1:47:38.680 --> 1:47:40.680]  Just to see the way the first run experience is like,
[1:47:40.680 --> 1:47:43.680]  you can hook up a Bluetooth, your Apple Bluetooth keyboard,
[1:47:43.680 --> 1:47:45.680]  or I guess any Bluetooth keyboard to it.
[1:47:45.680 --> 1:47:47.680]  And then enter your Wi-Fi password that way,
[1:47:47.680 --> 1:47:50.680]  which is a hell of a lot easier than the up-down left, right.
[1:47:50.680 --> 1:47:54.680]  It's like nonsense.
[1:47:54.680 --> 1:47:57.680]  So iPhone is an Apple TV remote.
[1:47:57.680 --> 1:47:59.680]  I mean, maybe they'll still have an app for it, but it's no good.
[1:47:59.680 --> 1:48:03.680]  You cannot sell a thing and then tell people that you have to run out and buy an iPod.
[1:48:03.680 --> 1:48:05.680]  A $600 iPhone.
[1:48:05.680 --> 1:48:09.680]  And then have one that's in the living room at all times.
[1:48:09.680 --> 1:48:18.680]  So like, even if like a family, the two parents and they both have iPhones,
[1:48:18.680 --> 1:48:22.680]  they can't say that you have to have one of those iPhones from front of the TV.
[1:48:22.680 --> 1:48:26.680]  So if the kid wants to watch TV, you know, one of the parents has to give up their iPhone,
[1:48:26.680 --> 1:48:28.680]  it's crazy.
[1:48:28.680 --> 1:48:32.680]  Oh, just buy your kid a $200 iPod touch.
[1:48:32.680 --> 1:48:37.680]  You can't sell a $200 remote control to a $150 box, you know.
[1:48:37.680 --> 1:48:39.680]  Well, the one reason, I mean, other than the keypad part,
[1:48:39.680 --> 1:48:45.680]  the one thing that I like about the remote app is that the remote is always in my pocket,
[1:48:45.680 --> 1:48:52.680]  or on my wrist now, whereas, you know, you try and find one of those, those little things.
[1:48:52.680 --> 1:48:54.680]  It's a fucking pain in the ass.
[1:48:54.680 --> 1:48:55.680]  Yeah.
[1:48:55.680 --> 1:48:58.680]  So like, my kid will just, you know, he'd turn something on,
[1:48:58.680 --> 1:49:01.680]  he just sits it on the couch and then, you know, five minutes later,
[1:49:01.680 --> 1:49:04.680]  it's stuck in the cushions someplace.
[1:49:04.680 --> 1:49:09.680]  Hey, does your kid sit real close to the TV when he plays video games?
[1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:10.680]  Oh, sure.
[1:49:10.680 --> 1:49:11.680]  So, yeah.
[1:49:11.680 --> 1:49:16.680]  So that's why I don't want Jonas to know how to be his, his 720 because he's,
[1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:19.680]  hey, he's young and he's, so he's got, still got great eyes.
[1:49:19.680 --> 1:49:22.680]  Who knows for how long given how close he sits to the TV,
[1:49:22.680 --> 1:49:28.680]  but he sits close enough that he's absolutely,
[1:49:28.680 --> 1:49:33.680]  positively within range where he would be able to see the difference between 720 and 1080.
[1:49:33.680 --> 1:49:34.680]  Oh, yeah.
[1:49:34.680 --> 1:49:37.680]  I just keep waiting for him to notice.
[1:49:37.680 --> 1:49:39.680]  He's got to go over to other kids' houses and see.
[1:49:39.680 --> 1:49:40.680]  Right.
[1:49:40.680 --> 1:49:46.680]  And I don't think I'm going to be able to sell him on the advantages of plasma versus,
[1:49:46.680 --> 1:49:54.680]  you know, plasma seven to, I really firmly, truly 100% my heart believed that I like a 720p
[1:49:54.680 --> 1:49:58.680]  plasma and a fact that I sit far enough away,
[1:49:58.680 --> 1:50:01.680]  always that I know that I wouldn't see the difference.
[1:50:01.680 --> 1:50:04.680]  I mean, you know, my, one eye screwed up anyway.
[1:50:04.680 --> 1:50:06.680]  So there's no way I would see the difference,
[1:50:06.680 --> 1:50:08.680]  but I know that he would cause he sits so damn close.
[1:50:08.680 --> 1:50:10.680]  So when we, when me and you were kids,
[1:50:10.680 --> 1:50:13.680]  I, I guess I remember sitting close to the TV to play Atari.
[1:50:13.680 --> 1:50:16.680]  And my parents would yell at me every time and make me move back.
[1:50:16.680 --> 1:50:19.680]  And they'd say, you know, you're going to, you know, you're going to recognize.
[1:50:19.680 --> 1:50:24.680]  And I remember, this is one of those things where I filed this away in my head as they don't know anything.
[1:50:24.680 --> 1:50:25.680]  They don't know this.
[1:50:25.680 --> 1:50:29.680]  They're not optometrists, you know, they don't show me the evidence that,
[1:50:29.680 --> 1:50:32.680]  sitting close, you know, I sit close to a book when I read it.
[1:50:32.680 --> 1:50:33.680]  Why can't I sit close to the TV?
[1:50:33.680 --> 1:50:37.680]  So I filed it away in my head that when I'm a parent, I'm not going to do that.
[1:50:37.680 --> 1:50:39.680]  And I've stuck to that.
[1:50:39.680 --> 1:50:40.680]  I don't.
[1:50:40.680 --> 1:50:44.680]  I will sometimes question him and I'll say, are you sure you want to sit that close?
[1:50:44.680 --> 1:50:45.680]  Yeah.
[1:50:45.680 --> 1:50:48.680]  And he says, well, I started doing that simply because that's what I had heard.
[1:50:48.680 --> 1:50:50.680]  And then I thought, wait a minute.
[1:50:50.680 --> 1:50:54.680]  This is not, I mean, first of all, these, you know, sitting close to a cathode
[1:50:54.680 --> 1:50:59.680]  radio, I think is a little different than sitting close to like, there's nothing.
[1:50:59.680 --> 1:51:00.680]  There's nothing.
[1:51:00.680 --> 1:51:03.680]  There's not like some radiation coming out of that thing.
[1:51:03.680 --> 1:51:04.680]  It's a flat.
[1:51:04.680 --> 1:51:05.680]  Yeah.
[1:51:05.680 --> 1:51:06.680]  It's just like liquid crystal.
[1:51:06.680 --> 1:51:07.680]  It's not.
[1:51:07.680 --> 1:51:08.680]  I'm worried.
[1:51:08.680 --> 1:51:10.680]  I'm worried I'm going to Google this after the show and it's going to say like, yeah,
[1:51:10.680 --> 1:51:13.680]  sitting close to a cathode radio is shown.
[1:51:13.680 --> 1:51:18.680]  It specifically leads to retinal detachments later in life.
[1:51:18.680 --> 1:51:21.680]  And like, holy shit, this is my fault.
[1:51:21.680 --> 1:51:22.680]  And stabbing yourself in my hand.
[1:51:22.680 --> 1:51:25.680]  Yeah, stabbing yourself in there.
[1:51:25.680 --> 1:51:27.680]  Falling down the stairs.
[1:51:27.680 --> 1:51:28.680]  Holy shit, though.
[1:51:28.680 --> 1:51:31.680]  Does my kid sit close to TV when he plays.
[1:51:31.680 --> 1:51:33.680]  Hank's side side is not great.
[1:51:33.680 --> 1:51:36.680]  So he often sits close to the TV.
[1:51:36.680 --> 1:51:39.680]  And whatever he's playing.
[1:51:39.680 --> 1:51:40.680]  Yeah.
[1:51:40.680 --> 1:51:41.680]  So.
[1:51:41.680 --> 1:51:45.680]  But he put his glasses on and he can back up like,
[1:51:45.680 --> 1:51:46.680]  foot.
[1:51:46.680 --> 1:51:47.680]  Yeah.
[1:51:47.680 --> 1:51:50.680]  There's nothing to do with like needing to sit close.
[1:51:50.680 --> 1:51:51.680]  He just likes it.
[1:51:51.680 --> 1:51:52.680]  No, I don't know.
[1:51:52.680 --> 1:51:53.680]  Well, that's why.
[1:51:53.680 --> 1:51:54.680]  Yeah.
[1:51:54.680 --> 1:51:55.680]  I mean, I think that's why I always did too.
[1:51:55.680 --> 1:51:56.680]  Yeah.
[1:51:56.680 --> 1:51:58.680]  Well, it fills your field of vision.
[1:51:58.680 --> 1:51:59.680]  Right.
[1:51:59.680 --> 1:52:01.680]  You want to immerse yourself in that experience.
[1:52:01.680 --> 1:52:02.680]  Right.
[1:52:02.680 --> 1:52:04.680]  It's effectively you have a bigger display that way.
[1:52:04.680 --> 1:52:05.680]  Especially, I think, yeah.
[1:52:05.680 --> 1:52:08.680]  And especially with games, which is our experience.
[1:52:08.680 --> 1:52:09.680]  Yeah.
[1:52:09.680 --> 1:52:13.680]  Well, it's just funny because now the way that our living room is arranged,
[1:52:13.680 --> 1:52:18.680]  the couch really has to be a certain distance away from the television.
[1:52:18.680 --> 1:52:22.680]  And I've sat on the couch and held my iPad up.
[1:52:22.680 --> 1:52:24.680]  And my iPad is closer.
[1:52:24.680 --> 1:52:26.680]  You know, his field fills more.
[1:52:26.680 --> 1:52:27.680]  Hmm.
[1:52:27.680 --> 1:52:28.680]  A larger area than the TV.
[1:52:28.680 --> 1:52:29.680]  And the TV's not small.
[1:52:29.680 --> 1:52:30.680]  It's 42 inches.
[1:52:30.680 --> 1:52:31.680]  It's not huge either.
[1:52:31.680 --> 1:52:33.680]  But it's, but it's pretty big.
[1:52:33.680 --> 1:52:34.680]  Yeah.
[1:52:34.680 --> 1:52:39.680]  And yet, if I have my iPad, it's actually a better option.
[1:52:39.680 --> 1:52:40.680]  Hmm.
[1:52:40.680 --> 1:52:41.680]  Interesting.
[1:52:41.680 --> 1:52:44.680]  But I'll have a new TV.
[1:52:44.680 --> 1:52:45.680]  I'll have a new Apple TV.
[1:52:45.680 --> 1:52:46.680]  Something.
[1:52:46.680 --> 1:52:47.680]  Yeah.
[1:52:47.680 --> 1:52:52.680]  But anyway, new remote for the Apple TV.
[1:52:52.680 --> 1:52:58.680]  But nobody really knows anything about what this is going to be like,
[1:52:58.680 --> 1:53:00.680]  which is super cool to me.
[1:53:00.680 --> 1:53:04.680]  Like, you know, what is the basic gist of the...
[1:53:04.680 --> 1:53:07.680]  Like, in my opinion, we don't really know much more than we knew that,
[1:53:07.680 --> 1:53:10.680]  you know, blah, blah, blah Apple is going to make a phone.
[1:53:10.680 --> 1:53:13.680]  I guess we know a little more because we know that this remote is supposedly
[1:53:13.680 --> 1:53:14.680]  like a little touchpad.
[1:53:14.680 --> 1:53:17.680]  And we didn't even know the iPhone had a touch screen, right?
[1:53:17.680 --> 1:53:19.680]  Um, you know, hopefully iPhone came out.
[1:53:19.680 --> 1:53:23.680]  But it's, it's close to that level of who knows what they're going to do.
[1:53:23.680 --> 1:53:25.680]  And what the interface is going to be like, right?
[1:53:25.680 --> 1:53:28.680]  It's, uh, I don't know.
[1:53:28.680 --> 1:53:29.680]  I'm, I'm really excited.
[1:53:29.680 --> 1:53:30.680]  I really opened that.
[1:53:30.680 --> 1:53:33.680]  They've, they've got like a big wow in store.
[1:53:33.680 --> 1:53:34.680]  Yeah.
[1:53:34.680 --> 1:53:35.680]  And I read about this.
[1:53:35.680 --> 1:53:36.680]  I wrote about this last week.
[1:53:36.680 --> 1:53:40.680]  I think the stakes are higher for them with this than with the watch.
[1:53:40.680 --> 1:53:42.680]  I think that the watch, I think this needs,
[1:53:42.680 --> 1:53:47.680]  that they need to do a better job with this than they did with the watch.
[1:53:47.680 --> 1:53:49.680]  And that the stakes are higher.
[1:53:49.680 --> 1:53:52.680]  Cause if it's, if it's a mediocre product, I feel like they're,
[1:53:52.680 --> 1:53:56.680]  it, it's not going to do as well as they need it to do.
[1:53:56.680 --> 1:53:58.680]  Hmm.
[1:53:58.680 --> 1:54:00.680]  What, uh, hmm.
[1:54:00.680 --> 1:54:04.680]  And it gets back to what I said, you know, while I go on the show and we were
[1:54:04.680 --> 1:54:08.680]  talking about watches that the watch kind of because it piggybacks on the phone.
[1:54:08.680 --> 1:54:11.680]  If you have an iPhone and you want to get a smart watch,
[1:54:11.680 --> 1:54:12.680]  you're going to get an Apple watch.
[1:54:12.680 --> 1:54:14.680]  And so they've got like a home field advantage there.
[1:54:14.680 --> 1:54:17.680]  Whereas there's a little bit of that with the Apple TV,
[1:54:17.680 --> 1:54:19.680]  where if you're in the ecosystem,
[1:54:19.680 --> 1:54:22.680]  if you already have an iTunes account,
[1:54:22.680 --> 1:54:24.680]  but everybody has an iTunes account, right?
[1:54:24.680 --> 1:54:25.680]  I mean, who doesn't have?
[1:54:25.680 --> 1:54:29.680]  I guess kids, you know, teenagers who've never gotten into buying music,
[1:54:29.680 --> 1:54:33.680]  but, you know, anybody who's an adult has an iTunes account.
[1:54:33.680 --> 1:54:36.680]  Um, and if you've already bought a bunch of movies and TV shows, you know,
[1:54:36.680 --> 1:54:39.680]  there's some motivation there to, to get an Apple TV,
[1:54:39.680 --> 1:54:42.680]  but it's, to me, it's nowhere near as tied to that.
[1:54:42.680 --> 1:54:44.680]  You know, that if you own an iPhone,
[1:54:44.680 --> 1:54:47.680]  even if you own an iPhone and an Apple watch and you have a MacBook,
[1:54:47.680 --> 1:54:53.680]  um, there's nothing stopping you from buying a rock you or any of these other boxes.
[1:54:53.680 --> 1:54:56.680]  You know, whereas, um, and many,
[1:54:56.680 --> 1:54:59.680]  I mean, most of the, most of the nerves that I know anyway have multiple,
[1:54:59.680 --> 1:55:00.680]  multiple boxes.
[1:55:00.680 --> 1:55:01.680]  Yeah.
[1:55:01.680 --> 1:55:06.680]  So, and I, but I kind of feel like the race is on to make the box, right?
[1:55:06.680 --> 1:55:11.680]  And it doesn't necessarily, even if you're a really staunch fan of Apple stuff,
[1:55:11.680 --> 1:55:16.680]  that doesn't mean it's going to be the Apple TV unless the Apple TV is great.
[1:55:16.680 --> 1:55:18.680]  It has to be great for its to succeed.
[1:55:18.680 --> 1:55:19.680]  Yeah.
[1:55:19.680 --> 1:55:21.680]  That's the own, and that's exciting to me.
[1:55:21.680 --> 1:55:23.680]  You know, whereas I feel like with the watch,
[1:55:23.680 --> 1:55:26.680]  the watch didn't have to be great for it to succeed.
[1:55:26.680 --> 1:55:27.680]  Pretty good.
[1:55:27.680 --> 1:55:31.680]  It would do, if it, if it is pretty good, it'll do pretty good.
[1:55:31.680 --> 1:55:33.680]  Whereas I feel like with Apple TV, if it's only pretty good,
[1:55:33.680 --> 1:55:35.680]  it's not even going to do pretty good in terms of,
[1:55:35.680 --> 1:55:36.680]  yeah.
[1:55:36.680 --> 1:55:38.680]  Like it really has to be great.
[1:55:38.680 --> 1:55:41.680]  So the, one of the key, other key features in the,
[1:55:41.680 --> 1:55:50.680]  the remote is supposedly universal search, which has been problematic on that thing forever.
[1:55:50.680 --> 1:55:54.680]  Because it's like you want to watch something, but you don't know where it's
[1:55:54.680 --> 1:55:55.680]  available.
[1:55:55.680 --> 1:55:56.680]  Right.
[1:55:56.680 --> 1:55:57.680]  Right.
[1:55:57.680 --> 1:55:58.680]  So you, you think they're going to do that?
[1:55:58.680 --> 1:56:00.680]  Well, that's one of the things that they're talking.
[1:56:00.680 --> 1:56:01.680]  I mean, that's, I hope so.
[1:56:01.680 --> 1:56:02.680]  I certainly hope so.
[1:56:02.680 --> 1:56:05.680]  And then, you know, and then tying Siri into that, you know, find me.
[1:56:05.680 --> 1:56:07.680]  That'll start you like to go or whatever.
[1:56:07.680 --> 1:56:08.680]  Right.
[1:56:08.680 --> 1:56:10.680]  Find me six feet deep something.
[1:56:10.680 --> 1:56:14.680]  You know, and Siri says you can get it here or here or here.
[1:56:14.680 --> 1:56:15.680]  Yeah.
[1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:16.680]  Or it's streaming over here.
[1:56:16.680 --> 1:56:19.680]  I mean, you know, it seems like those guys,
[1:56:19.680 --> 1:56:21.680]  they have to tie into it.
[1:56:21.680 --> 1:56:22.680]  So I don't know.
[1:56:22.680 --> 1:56:30.680]  I mean, maybe it's a difficult sell because a lot of them don't necessarily want to be in that level of competition.
[1:56:30.680 --> 1:56:33.680]  You know, because it really, it really kind of could,
[1:56:33.680 --> 1:56:37.680]  can screw you if your deal isn't quite as good as somebody else's.
[1:56:37.680 --> 1:56:38.680]  Hmm.
[1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:43.680]  And the, and the, it seems like the apps need to hook into that.
[1:56:43.680 --> 1:56:44.680]  And, I mean, well, yeah, I mean, that's obvious.
[1:56:44.680 --> 1:56:49.680]  The apps have to hook into that in order to be able to allow them to do that.
[1:56:49.680 --> 1:56:53.680]  I, I think though that most would or at least like the,
[1:56:53.680 --> 1:56:55.680]  enough of the big ones would, right?
[1:56:55.680 --> 1:56:57.680]  The ones who are already partners with Apple.
[1:56:57.680 --> 1:57:02.680]  So for example, let's just Netflix Hulu HBO,
[1:57:02.680 --> 1:57:04.680]  just to name a couple of them, right?
[1:57:04.680 --> 1:57:10.680]  So, and again, Apple TV to date has been what I think that they thought they were going to,
[1:57:10.680 --> 1:57:14.680]  the, the, the, the no app store camp thought they would do with the iPhone,
[1:57:14.680 --> 1:57:15.680]  where they have these partners.
[1:57:15.680 --> 1:57:17.680]  And there's, you know, now that at this point,
[1:57:17.680 --> 1:57:22.680]  there's lots and lots of channels or apps or whatever you want to call them on the current Apple TV.
[1:57:22.680 --> 1:57:24.680]  But they're all done in partnership.
[1:57:24.680 --> 1:57:29.680]  Like there's no way, like so, and so for example, the conspicuous absent is,
[1:57:29.680 --> 1:57:31.680]  conspicuously absent is Amazon.
[1:57:31.680 --> 1:57:34.680]  So if you have Amazon Prime, you need another box.
[1:57:34.680 --> 1:57:37.680]  You, you cannot, you know, there's no way to do it now.
[1:57:37.680 --> 1:57:40.680]  Whereas once this app store comes out presumably,
[1:57:40.680 --> 1:57:43.680]  Amazon will be able to write an Amazon app for the Apple TV.
[1:57:43.680 --> 1:57:46.680]  And even if Apple and Amazon never, you know,
[1:57:46.680 --> 1:57:49.680]  work out their own special deal, they'll just be in the app store.
[1:57:49.680 --> 1:57:52.680]  In the same way that you can watch Amazon Prime on your iPad.
[1:57:52.680 --> 1:57:59.680]  And so is it your view that it's Apple controlling that rather than Amazon not wanting to be on the Apple TV?
[1:57:59.680 --> 1:58:03.680]  Oh, I, I think so. Yeah, I think that, I'm guessing that Amazon would,
[1:58:03.680 --> 1:58:07.680]  but I think, I think that the way that the two companies don't like each other, you know,
[1:58:07.680 --> 1:58:10.680]  yeah. And I sort of thought it was the other way around that they,
[1:58:10.680 --> 1:58:12.680]  Amazon simply wanted you to go out and buy a fire stick.
[1:58:12.680 --> 1:58:16.680]  But I don't think so because, boy, you can get Amazon and just about every other box.
[1:58:16.680 --> 1:58:21.680]  If you look, if you, it's right, I'm not sure that you can even find a box that doesn't have.
[1:58:21.680 --> 1:58:24.680]  Amazon. Yeah, maybe we talked about, we talked about this on the rebound.
[1:58:24.680 --> 1:58:29.680]  And Dan pointed that to me too. And so I was thinking, yeah, it's probably, it was probably wrong.
[1:58:29.680 --> 1:58:35.680]  Yeah, I think so. I think it's Apple, but it's certainly on enough that it's, it's there.
[1:58:35.680 --> 1:58:40.680]  I think we have it on our Tivo. And it's really weird. Oh, it's, I don't know what the hell kind of crap.
[1:58:40.680 --> 1:58:44.680]  You write these apps on for Tivo. Like when you, when you switch to the,
[1:58:44.680 --> 1:58:48.680]  we have a really new Tivo too. It's, it's like the top of the line,
[1:58:48.680 --> 1:58:56.680]  and jobby. When you launch the Amazon thing, it's like the screen like zaps out.
[1:58:56.680 --> 1:59:03.680]  You know, like almost like the TV went off. Like, I don't know, it just feels like it was,
[1:59:03.680 --> 1:59:09.680]  I might even be right. I might not even be making this up that it's like written in like shockwave or something like that.
[1:59:09.680 --> 1:59:15.680]  It really feels like it. And it's not, it's not high deaf. It's, it's a standard depth picture.
[1:59:15.680 --> 1:59:20.680]  Oh, so bad. Um, anyway, though, I don't think Apple would have a hard time at all,
[1:59:20.680 --> 1:59:29.680]  at least with like people who they would want to promote on stage, like Netflix and Hulu and, and HBO,
[1:59:29.680 --> 1:59:35.680]  um, to get them to, to open up the search, right? Why wouldn't you want, why wouldn't Netflix want that?
[1:59:35.680 --> 1:59:39.680]  I mean, I mean, it wasn't just silly. Just certainly no reason Netflix wouldn't want it. That's right.
[1:59:39.680 --> 1:59:42.680]  Right. Yeah. Yeah. Cause everything is free. Right.
[1:59:42.680 --> 1:59:47.680]  It's no, no additional cost anyway. Right. It's just, I would, you know,
[1:59:47.680 --> 1:59:53.680]  I mean, you know, like Amazon, like if it's, if it's the difference between, although Amazon probably sells all that stuff for less than Apple, those.
[1:59:53.680 --> 2:00:00.680]  Yeah. It seems so. The universal search thing. I know, I've, I know he's talked about it in one of the shows he's on a million times,
[2:00:00.680 --> 2:00:05.680]  but like it's just, every time it happens to me, I always think of Merlin, uh, Merlin man,
[2:00:05.680 --> 2:00:09.680]  because I just know it's the sort of thing that just drives Merlin crazy. You know, like,
[2:00:09.680 --> 2:00:14.680]  so let's say you sit down with your family and you're going to, you've agreed to watch, uh,
[2:00:14.680 --> 2:00:18.680]  caddy shack or whatever. Take a family, you know, good family movie like that.
[2:00:18.680 --> 2:00:24.680]  Um, and you search for caddy shack, but you have to search and, and you, you would like,
[2:00:24.680 --> 2:00:29.680]  let's watch it for free in Netflix and you go to Netflix and it ends up in Netflix doesn't have caddy shack,
[2:00:29.680 --> 2:00:34.680]  but you've just been, and, and you sat there typing it in on, on the remote. Right.
[2:00:34.680 --> 2:00:39.680]  This ridiculous little up-down left-right remote that is not even using bluetooth.
[2:00:39.680 --> 2:00:44.680]  You have to point the goddamn infrared ray at the thing. And then you get all the way to do this and it ends up,
[2:00:44.680 --> 2:00:49.680]  they don't have caddy shack and then you go back and you go and then you have to,
[2:00:49.680 --> 2:00:54.680]  and to start the search again in the, you know, the iTunes store to get it from iTunes.
[2:00:54.680 --> 2:01:02.680]  You have to type it all over again. It doesn't even, you know, does not like a universal search memory or something like that.
[2:01:02.680 --> 2:01:07.680]  The idea that you could just say, find me caddy shack and it'll show you all of your options,
[2:01:07.680 --> 2:01:13.680]  you know, for how to watch caddy shack right now, including just hit here and you can start streaming it for free on Netflix.
[2:01:13.680 --> 2:01:19.680]  It would be fantastic. Right. In fact, I almost feel like it has to do that. Like if it doesn't do that, I think that's,
[2:01:19.680 --> 2:01:26.680]  Yeah, if it doesn't do that, it's going to be kind of a disappointment. I know that the, I mean, the, the Amazon device does that to a certain degree,
[2:01:26.680 --> 2:01:33.680]  I think it kind of prioritizes Amazon's. Yeah, like if it's like if it's free someplace else, their stuff still shows up like,
[2:01:33.680 --> 2:01:37.680]  hey, you can get it here. Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if Apple's does that too. If, you know,
[2:01:37.680 --> 2:01:46.680]  maybe iTunes offering is first, but yeah, I mean, yeah, I don't know. I'll swipe down a couple of times to watch it for free. Sure.
[2:01:46.680 --> 2:02:01.680]  I feel like in general, you know, because it's been so long since they've had a serious update to Apple TV, I feel like we're actually being reasonable by demanding a lot of this.
[2:02:01.680 --> 2:02:12.680]  Yes, I completely agree. Like in general, I tried to be reasonable in my expectations, you know, and, and, you know, the whole idea that, you know,
[2:02:12.680 --> 2:02:27.680]  famous, I you know, it's you're going to have, we're going to see at least 50 articles by the end of the week that say, there's not enough in the iPhone 6S to make people upgrade from the save Apple.
[2:02:27.680 --> 2:02:37.680]  Right. Not enough. There's not enough reasons to upgrade from last year's iPhone. Therefore, it's a failure. Whereas the whole point is normal people don't upgrade. They don't buy a new phone every year.
[2:02:37.680 --> 2:02:46.680]  You know, I feel though that, you know, with the Apple TV, it really does have to be enough that makes everybody who already has an Apple TV want to upgrade.
[2:02:46.680 --> 2:02:48.680]  Yeah.
[2:02:48.680 --> 2:02:54.680]  Yeah, it's, I mean, so it's been three and a half years since the most recent one.
[2:02:54.680 --> 2:03:00.680]  And that was only like a kind of a bump from the previous one. Yeah, it's just a phone. Yeah, really.
[2:03:00.680 --> 2:03:18.680]  Yeah, the picture of the pictures nicer too, but, yeah, but other than that, right, it's not that much. It's the same basic concept and infrared remote that goes up down left right select play pause and, and that you just sit there and move up down left move a selection up down left right around the screen full of apps.
[2:03:18.680 --> 2:03:25.680]  And then when you go in there, right, this is this, you know, same thing. Yeah, gotta be able to, they gotta do something new.
[2:03:25.680 --> 2:03:48.680]  I think they're going to pull it off. That's the, this is the other interesting thing to me is that I've detected an awful lot of, I guess pessimism or almost like a like we've been so disappointed and limited by what Apple TV is for so long that there's an awful lot of people who it seems to me don't don't really have high expectations for this.
[2:03:48.680 --> 2:04:02.680]  I mean, I don't know. I could be wrong about that. I don't know if you've noticed that that there's an awful lot of people who really think that, you know, this is going to be, you know, they just don't think Apple TV is ever going to be good because it hasn't been good.
[2:04:02.680 --> 2:04:10.680]  Yeah. Well, I think one of the big concerns was that it seems like they, the hard part is striking the deals.
[2:04:10.680 --> 2:04:19.680]  And a lot of people were also just expecting Apple to come up with their own streaming service, their own television streaming server. Yeah. Yeah.
[2:04:19.680 --> 2:04:35.680]  Television media, whatever. I mean, still along the lines of Netflix, I guess. And that that would be a key feature of it and that if they were able to do it, they would have done it a long time ago and they haven't done it so that means that they're not able to do it so it's not going to happen.
[2:04:35.680 --> 2:04:45.680]  I don't feel like that that's, I mean, I think that would be nice if they were able to do something that's better, but I still think that they could introduce a device that's really good without having to do that.
[2:04:45.680 --> 2:04:53.680]  I mean, if it has that global search functionality, I think that would work almost as well.
[2:04:53.680 --> 2:05:10.680]  I think they need to do it. I think though at a fundamental level, what they, what I really think they need to do, I really think that they need to do it. And I really hope that they have is they really need to make the basic interaction with the TV.
[2:05:10.680 --> 2:05:30.680]  Awesome that you are actually feel like you're having fun just by like choosing which thing to pick, right? Because that's really what fundamentally what they did with the iPhone where cell phones were always these things that were really junky and they had buttons that were like just didn't feel good.
[2:05:30.680 --> 2:05:46.680]  And these weird little Java applets that they called games that were always super high in the latency and, you know, the type of games that like adults play, you know, like just to waste two minutes, like it would never ever interest a kid, right, who had like a,
[2:05:46.680 --> 2:06:03.680]  yeah, like a game boy. Like in the way that like game boys have always been right since their first one really responsive fun top notch little gadgets. Apple did that to the phone. They took this thing that was across the board no matter which brand you bought.
[2:06:03.680 --> 2:06:15.680]  It was a crap experience and brought it all the way forward to this is an awesome experience and there's no latency and the screen, you know, it, it scrolls exactly one to one with your fingers as you touch.
[2:06:15.680 --> 2:06:22.680]  And when you touch something, you don't have to wait for it to respond. It responds a second, you know, just like a physical item. They need to make the TV like that.
[2:06:22.680 --> 2:06:28.680]  So that when you're sitting there moving your thumb around the remote or whatever you're going to do that it's, but just fun.
[2:06:28.680 --> 2:06:36.680]  Like it just feels fun just to interact with your TV and that, you know, and like a perfect Bluetooth connection from the remote to the TV.
[2:06:36.680 --> 2:06:51.680]  So there's never any latency and you're never like moving your finger around and nothing is happening. And when you select something and needs the launch right away and you're right in there and it's, you know, like like the iPhone.
[2:06:51.680 --> 2:07:01.680]  Because so much of what frustrates me with the every everything really I mean everything I've ever hooked up to my TV is just the stuff never seems to respond fast enough.
[2:07:01.680 --> 2:07:12.680]  Yeah. The best device I have is a Tivo, but by far just in general just because the newest one does have a Bluetooth remote not infrared.
[2:07:12.680 --> 2:07:19.680]  It is pretty good and the latency isn't that bad and I don't think the latency is between the remote and the Tivo.
[2:07:19.680 --> 2:07:24.680]  I think it's just that the Tivo itself has always had sort of a notoriously slow interface.
[2:07:24.680 --> 2:07:35.680]  And this is a thing I know Syracuse has gone on and on about this and I share it and I feel like I wouldn't even have the longing in my heart if I didn't own a Tivo forever.
[2:07:35.680 --> 2:07:39.680]  The one thing Tivo has always done really, really well.
[2:07:39.680 --> 2:07:50.680]  I mean going back to like my first one in like 1999 or 2000 is that when you're playing video you can fast forward and rewind and it's perfect.
[2:07:50.680 --> 2:08:00.680]  In fact it's almost like they're too smart. I find that like they do like they're like when you fast forward through commercials and you see the show and you hit play.
[2:08:00.680 --> 2:08:07.680]  It goes back a little bit because you know that's when you've hit play is when you've seen that the show's back on they go back too far.
[2:08:07.680 --> 2:08:21.680]  Like my reactions you know my what do you call it? Motor skills I don't know. I'm quick enough hand-eye coordination.
[2:08:21.680 --> 2:08:28.680]  Yeah yeah my reaction time is fast enough that they actually helped me too much and then I see the last 10 seconds of the commercial I just skipped.
[2:08:28.680 --> 2:08:42.680]  But the fast forwarding video on Apple TV and rewinding is garbage. It is so bad and in some cases like with the streaming stuff it doesn't even show it to you. It just goes black.
[2:08:42.680 --> 2:08:47.680]  Right because it's got a buffer all that stuff before I can do that and it doesn't even if you're going.
[2:08:47.680 --> 2:08:56.680]  Right far enough you're going to go past the puffer. Right so I feel like I really want somebody's going to do it eventually and it's the sort of thing that Apple cares about.
[2:08:56.680 --> 2:09:06.680]  So I hope it's you know I hope it's I hope it's Apple I hope it's coming this week is that to get it so that you know fast forwarding and rewinding video is as good as it can be.
[2:09:06.680 --> 2:09:16.680]  Or closer you know at least it's more like that first iPhone and the first iPhone you know by today's standards actually wasn't low latency and now it feels like it's laggy.
[2:09:16.680 --> 2:09:28.680]  But at the time it was a revelation so at least I would I I demanded I will call for Tim Cook's resignation if I don't get it.
[2:09:28.680 --> 2:09:34.680]  I want to be able to fast forward and rewind video and have it feel like it's a good experience.
[2:09:34.680 --> 2:09:42.680]  You're throwing that in kind of late. He's got to get that done by Wednesday. I don't think that's going to happen.
[2:09:42.680 --> 2:09:53.680]  You're funny. I mean one of the things one of the things which I find kind of odd about these rumors that some are saying that they're going to be too they're going to have two different memory sizes.
[2:09:53.680 --> 2:10:03.680]  Like there's like an eight gigabyte and a 16 gigabyte which I I don't believe that because I don't think they're going to be able to make people understand why.
[2:10:03.680 --> 2:10:15.680]  And it seems like a weird thing to do for those devices and I feel like the smart thing to do would be well yeah they don't do this with the phones but the to do the 16 gigabyte and don't just don't.
[2:10:15.680 --> 2:10:41.680]  Well get the do the 16 gigabyte and if you want to charge more charge more don't screw around with an eight gigabyte one if that's if you're going to have to yeah and rather than have two tiers just get the just do the bigger one.
[2:10:41.680 --> 2:10:50.680]  I mean games take up space and I know it's not going to be like a PS4 or an Xbox type gaming thing.
[2:10:50.680 --> 2:11:06.680]  It's we already know it's got like an eight I mean that's just common sense you don't even have to read rumor sites to know it's going to have like an eight system on a chip and so we know the basically the you know the capabilities of that's not going to be like a graphics powerhouse but that's no reason that it couldn't have good games you know like.
[2:11:06.680 --> 2:11:11.680]  Like good Nintendo style games right casual.
[2:11:11.680 --> 2:11:13.680]  Yeah.
[2:11:13.680 --> 2:11:20.680]  I just can't see why they would why they would cheap out on eight versus 16 if you could easily fill it up right.
[2:11:20.680 --> 2:11:24.680]  I also think it's just confusing to offer two different sizes.
[2:11:24.680 --> 2:11:33.680]  And yeah I think so too I think that I mean I mean I know people understand that you know you you want to download a lot apps you got to get a bigger phone but I don't think.
[2:11:33.680 --> 2:11:41.680]  Yeah marketing wise it seems so much easier to just say buy the the new Apple TV $149.
[2:11:41.680 --> 2:11:48.680]  That's right that's it your choices to get a new Apple TV or not get one and be a loser and that's it.
[2:11:48.680 --> 2:12:02.680]  Like like just that one level of you want to eight or sixteen gigabytes instantly makes the decision to buy so much more complicated and I really do think that they know I think Apple knows that
[2:12:02.680 --> 2:12:06.680]  that complication results in some people saying I don't know what to get so I'm not going to get one.
[2:12:06.680 --> 2:12:07.680]  Yeah.
[2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:23.680]  And I really think that they would sell I convinced that they would sell more boxes and make more money just by giving one with sixteen gigabytes and to everybody then they would with to you know even if they could save some money on it.
[2:12:23.680 --> 2:12:27.680]  I really do I think they would make more money because I think that that complexity would just drive people nuts.
[2:12:27.680 --> 2:12:28.680]  Right.
[2:12:28.680 --> 2:12:32.680]  And I think you know I don't know it just seems crazy.
[2:12:32.680 --> 2:12:37.680]  Yeah I wouldn't think that would be that doesn't sound like them but.
[2:12:37.680 --> 2:12:40.680]  I hope at least I hope it's not that.
[2:12:40.680 --> 2:12:49.680]  I wonder though with the games I think about that though with like just how limiting would even sixteen gigabytes be.
[2:12:49.680 --> 2:13:01.680]  Because it seems like a lot of games are you know measure in the gigabytes already and you can't just you can obviously you know delete it app and then re download it later.
[2:13:01.680 --> 2:13:10.680]  But even with fast internet it's like downloading a two gigabyte game again because you deleted it a couple weeks ago but now you're in the mood to play it again is pain in the ass.
[2:13:10.680 --> 2:13:10.680]  Yeah.
[2:13:10.680 --> 2:13:13.680]  I think the Xbox wasn't the.
[2:13:13.680 --> 2:13:16.680]  I think the sizes were like thirty two gigabytes and then two hundred.
[2:13:16.680 --> 2:13:27.680]  Yeah something like that yeah I mean I think the difference was was huge and it was kind of like well maybe you want to use it just for doing TV and maybe a couple games.
[2:13:27.680 --> 2:13:30.680]  Or you're like a real serious gamer.
[2:13:30.680 --> 2:13:31.680]  Yeah.
[2:13:31.680 --> 2:13:36.680]  But you know that's that's twice as small or once twice as much as.
[2:13:36.680 --> 2:13:44.680]  Do you think do you think they're going to do like a home kit push with Apple TV.
[2:13:44.680 --> 2:13:48.680]  I don't know if they're ready for that yet I mean I think maybe it would get a mention.
[2:13:48.680 --> 2:13:55.680]  And then it I think that that's a long term plan right but maybe not part of this week's announcement.
[2:13:55.680 --> 2:13:57.680]  Yeah but maybe not part of this week's announcement.
[2:13:57.680 --> 2:14:07.680]  Because it seems like we're on a kind of a slow build to that stuff and I don't know that there I mean unless they they've worked something out with somebody else that that there's really like a compelling.
[2:14:07.680 --> 2:14:30.680]  Thing where you're going to you know be standing up at your chair to applaud but I think that the basic idea and it makes sense to me but the basic idea is that Apple TV could and ultimately should be like this always on you know even if it's in some low power mode always on always connected to the internet.
[2:14:30.680 --> 2:14:44.680]  And always available from everywhere sort of smart thing that in your house so that you could do things you know like the nest type things like you know you know somehow it would be like this thing that you could connect to.
[2:14:44.680 --> 2:14:52.680]  And you know have your lights turned on or have the air conditioning turn on you know at a certain schedule or stuff like that I don't know.
[2:14:52.680 --> 2:15:02.680]  But I don't know that I don't know that that there's anything that they've got stuff and like you said like an ecosystem in place to really make it a central part of this week's announcement.
[2:15:02.680 --> 2:15:14.680]  Yeah yeah I mean there's some speculation about them making their own stuff but we certainly haven't heard any rumors of what that might be so it doesn't seem like it would be coming.
[2:15:14.680 --> 2:15:25.680]  Yeah let me take a break and with one more sponsor thing and then we'll wrap up the show with our final thoughts about what else might be coming at the coming at the show but it's our good friends at back place.
[2:15:25.680 --> 2:15:38.680]  Honestly I love all those sponsors of the show they're all great this week if there's only one that I would say you have to use it's gotta be back place because it's so important.
[2:15:38.680 --> 2:15:45.680]  What is it it's online backup for the Mac.
[2:15:45.680 --> 2:15:55.680]  You download back place you install it on your Mac and you just let it run they've got a free trial no risk no credit card required just go there and sign up.
[2:15:55.680 --> 2:16:03.680]  And it just starts running and it just backs up everything on your Mac to their servers up in the cloud as they call it.
[2:16:03.680 --> 2:16:16.680]  You have external hard drives back some up to how much what's the limit no limit whatever you've got on your Mac it gets backed up to back place and it's five bucks a month that's it.
[2:16:16.680 --> 2:16:29.680]  It sounds too good to be true that's I think if there are people out there who haven't tried backblays haven't used it it's because this sounds unlimited backup for five dollars a month sounds too good to be true.
[2:16:29.680 --> 2:16:38.680]  There's no catch there is no catch and the reason why is that hard drives are not that expensive like there's no it sounds like well how can they stay in business.
[2:16:38.680 --> 2:16:54.680]  It's because hard drives are so you know cheap and they buy them in bulk and they do these cool things on their blog where like every year they have like a report of like which brands of hard drives had the most failure and stuff like that like because they have so many hard drives in this massive amount of storage.
[2:16:54.680 --> 2:16:59.680]  Here I got it in front of me 150 petabytes of data backed up from their customers.
[2:16:59.680 --> 2:17:04.680]  That five bucks a month it you know it works out there like a profitable successful company.
[2:17:04.680 --> 2:17:13.680]  The only catch involved is it really it might take a long time for your initial backup depending you know you might say I have tons of data I've terabytes of data.
[2:17:13.680 --> 2:17:19.680]  It might take a while for that depending on you know your your relationship with Comcast.
[2:17:19.680 --> 2:17:24.680]  But that's it they can't solve that problem but once it's backed up then everything else is incremental.
[2:17:24.680 --> 2:17:40.680]  The software is great it's written by former Apple engineers it's really good back software you'll never notice it running on your computer there's never any kind of like all of a sudden why is my fan on and you go check activity monitor and it's because back blazes running that doesn't happen it's great software.
[2:17:40.680 --> 2:17:51.680]  You'll never notice it and all of your stuff is backed up from anywhere I cannot say how great a feeling whatever leaf is knowing that everything on my on my Mac is backed up outside my house somewhere.
[2:17:51.680 --> 2:17:57.680]  When you need to restore you can just get one file at a time and download it or you can download everything.
[2:17:57.680 --> 2:18:09.680]  And to save time in a case of a disaster if you want to you can just buy a USB hard drive from them and they'll just put all of your data on the USB hard drive and overnight it to you.
[2:18:09.680 --> 2:18:14.680]  It could not be better anything you would want from an online backup they do it.
[2:18:14.680 --> 2:18:22.680]  So go to if you haven't signed up already and you're crazy if you haven't go to backblaze.com slash the talk show.
[2:18:22.680 --> 2:18:30.680]  That's backblaze.com slash the talk show and sign up it in five bucks a month that's it.
[2:18:30.680 --> 2:18:37.680]  If there is a second catch it's the five bucks per month per Mac so if you have two Macs then you're up to ten bucks a month.
[2:18:37.680 --> 2:18:41.680]  That's a fair deal in my opinion go sign up.
[2:18:41.680 --> 2:18:43.680]  Back up your crap.
[2:18:43.680 --> 2:18:47.680]  If you don't back up your stuff you're not.
[2:18:47.680 --> 2:18:49.680]  Anyway, what else do you think of the show?
[2:18:49.680 --> 2:18:50.680]  I don't think iPads are coming.
[2:18:50.680 --> 2:18:53.680]  You don't think the iPad pros coming.
[2:18:53.680 --> 2:18:58.680]  Yeah, I want to go I'm going to go I'm not going on I'm not going to make a bet.
[2:18:58.680 --> 2:19:02.680]  Here's what I will say this honest to God John I have nobody has told me anything about the event.
[2:19:02.680 --> 2:19:07.680]  So I don't have any inside birdies or information about I don't want to I don't want to know I want to be surprised.
[2:19:07.680 --> 2:19:16.680]  It's just my gut feeling my gut feeling is that they're going to do the exact same thing they've done in years past and have an iPad event.
[2:19:16.680 --> 2:19:26.680]  A smaller event in October and they'll do iPads and new maybe like the new iMac with the 4k display on the 21 inch screen.
[2:19:26.680 --> 2:19:32.680]  And talk about El Capitan you know there's a pattern to the way they do these things.
[2:19:32.680 --> 2:19:41.680]  And the October event is usually or has been the last few years new iPads and some new Mac news like showing off.
[2:19:41.680 --> 2:19:49.680]  And they I feel like a lot of people in the press forget just how simple Apple does things and how they often repeat themselves.
[2:19:49.680 --> 2:19:55.680]  So they'll show off El Capitan and all the features they're going to show are the same ones that they showed at WWDC in June.
[2:19:55.680 --> 2:20:05.680]  And they do this and people are why did they do that because you know we already knew all this stuff they showed us that in June because that they just want normal people to know about these features.
[2:20:05.680 --> 2:20:19.680]  And the way you communicate with people who aren't hyperactive news junkies is you repeat yourself multiple times right it's like running for office like why do politicians keep saying the same things over and over again while they're getting elected because that's how you get your message across.
[2:20:19.680 --> 2:20:25.680]  So they'll just review what's new in El Capitan. I don't see how they do all that in one event next week if they're going to do this.
[2:20:25.680 --> 2:20:33.680]  Yeah that's true Apple TV right and they and I'm hoping they're going to talk about when the watch of us too is coming.
[2:20:33.680 --> 2:20:38.680]  I think they're going to do that next week's event this is what I think this doesn't mean.
[2:20:38.680 --> 2:20:50.680]  Yeah so this is what I think they're going to do Wednesday I think they're going to I think it's going to be exactly like last year's event there'll be three well it meaning three things.
[2:20:50.680 --> 2:21:05.680]  First will be the new iPhones and I'll probably be Shiller again exactly like last year Phil Shiller will come out and he'll tell us all about the new iPhone 6s and 6s plus and forced touch and whatever else they have to talk about and how it all works.
[2:21:05.680 --> 2:21:15.680]  And here's when they're going to be available and I guarantee it's going to be like 10 days later or 9 days later on Friday you know the week the week after.
[2:21:15.680 --> 2:21:19.680]  What will that be Friday the 18th.
[2:21:19.680 --> 2:21:26.680]  Then part two now last year part two was Apple pay this year's part two I'll bet is Apple watch.
[2:21:26.680 --> 2:21:38.680]  And it'll be about everything new with a watch 2.0 and I think I said this on the show a couple weeks ago but I wouldn't be surprised if they came out with new bands.
[2:21:38.680 --> 2:22:02.680]  For the holiday season and I think probably german again somebody this week had a rumor that they're going to do new bands new sport bands at least.
[2:22:02.680 --> 2:22:16.680]  So it's a way to have new hardware to show without new stuff but then they'll just review all of the watch 2.0 features that they showed at WWDC but then they'll say here and here's when it'll be here's when they update will be available.
[2:22:16.680 --> 2:22:36.680]  And then I don't know if they'll do one more thing but then there will be one more thing and it'll be Apple TV and Apple TV will fill the that third and final spot that Apple watch played last year and they're going to have a lot to show because it's all new it's radically new.
[2:22:36.680 --> 2:22:52.680]  And there's probably going to be like partners there like I don't know if they'll have Netflix or anything that could take a long time that could it would should take a long time I don't see our after what I've just said those three things I don't see how there's any time left for iPad.
[2:22:52.680 --> 2:23:07.680]  And they might even want to talk business you know I mean they given the concern over the Chinese.
[2:23:07.680 --> 2:23:19.680]  Yeah yeah you know what you know and you know what and to get around like not giving numbers that one thing I don't think there's any law against is like here's photographs of one of our news stores in China.
[2:23:19.680 --> 2:23:30.680]  And it's jam packed with people buying things you know here's a chart with a line going up with no numbers on it a Bezos chart right here's a Bezos chart.
[2:23:30.680 --> 2:23:35.680]  Unlabeled axes.
[2:23:35.680 --> 2:23:53.680]  There's those I don't know if they should be called Bezos charts or New Yorker charts because it's like you know how like there's like like the the every single New Yorker cartoon is either two guys on an island or it's a guy in a suit with a chart either going up or down right.
[2:23:53.680 --> 2:24:07.680]  If they are you know that makes a lot of sense I think that makes a lot of I just don't see and there's and so then and then I mean the other thing is like the iPad pro if that's what whatever it's going to be assuming that's what it is.
[2:24:07.680 --> 2:24:11.680]  Is kind of a thing that they need to talk about for a while.
[2:24:11.680 --> 2:24:25.680]  And it's a new it's a whole new form factor and supposedly it's coming with like a stylus and keyboards and I mean that's a lot to talk about there too so and and if they're going to do a refreshed.
[2:24:25.680 --> 2:24:34.680]  Many which is what the with the rumor is and and not do a refresh or at least not do a significant refresh of the air.
[2:24:34.680 --> 2:24:48.680]  That seems like that might be enough to fill a whole keynote I really do, especially with a review of El Capitan and if they don't have a separate I'm sorry so you're saying the El Capitan when would be the October one.
[2:24:48.680 --> 2:24:58.680]  Yes, oh okay I'm sorry okay no I miss I just misunderstood you I think next week is I this week I guess this week iPhone Apple watch 2.0.
[2:24:58.680 --> 2:25:07.680]  And an update on you know the amazing things people are doing with their Apple watches and then Apple TV and then that's it that's two hours right there.
[2:25:07.680 --> 2:25:13.680]  Yeah, or even not even if it isn't two hours even if it's only 90 minutes or 95 minutes.
[2:25:13.680 --> 2:25:17.680]  It doesn't leave enough time to do the rest and I don't think they want to do I don't think they want to.
[2:25:17.680 --> 2:25:28.680]  I don't want to do too much of ones why wouldn't they just have a second events to spread out the publicity why in the world would they want to just have all this stuff at once and if there's an iPad pro.
[2:25:28.680 --> 2:25:35.680]  If I don't again I don't like I'm trying to get away from knowing stuff I don't want to know the secrets anyway I want to be surprised.
[2:25:35.680 --> 2:25:40.680]  So I don't know I have nobody on the inside who has ever said anything to me about iPad pro.
[2:25:40.680 --> 2:25:48.680]  Make sense to me though and there's awful lot of smoke you know where there's smoke there's fire and awful lot of smoke that they're doing it. I think you're right that it.
[2:25:48.680 --> 2:25:55.680]  That takes that that's going to be like a hey we need to take time that's a whole segment of an event to tell you why we're doing this.
[2:25:55.680 --> 2:25:56.680]  Yeah.
[2:25:56.680 --> 2:26:03.680]  And I was a lot there's a fair amount of explanation that needs to go on there I think right and I think I think who's I mean who's it for.
[2:26:03.680 --> 2:26:14.680]  Well I think it you know what I think is interesting about the iPad pro really interesting is that's a great question and the reason I think it's great is I think it's for.
[2:26:14.680 --> 2:26:24.680]  Tim Cook not only Tim Cook but in the way that like Steve Jobs like had them make the phone that he wanted and he knew that the lots of other people would want it to but it was like.
[2:26:24.680 --> 2:26:34.680]  I the way that Tim Cook talks about iPad and the way he says so many times that he does so much of his work on iPad and that he's you know doing this big push.
[2:26:34.680 --> 2:26:39.680]  Personally into the enterprise with the you know the IBM deal.
[2:26:39.680 --> 2:26:44.680]  Just see this thing that he was on stage at a Cisco event at the end of August.
[2:26:44.680 --> 2:26:54.680]  Yeah well I heard that I didn't realize he was on stage I heard that they were doing it they were also looking up to do with thing about getting I.
[2:26:54.680 --> 2:27:01.680]  It was into the end of the enterprise was it more about I forget exactly it was last Monday and I don't think it was strong no okay so this was more recent.
[2:27:01.680 --> 2:27:10.680]  Yeah it was a huge event in Vegas it was like that some kind of big Cisco conference with you know and it was like in the.
[2:27:10.680 --> 2:27:19.680]  The MGM grand like the arena where all the big fights are like the Mayweather fighting stuff like that like a 1000s without you know 6 10,000 seat arena I don't know.
[2:27:19.680 --> 2:27:21.680]  Not the can't say go fight.
[2:27:21.680 --> 2:27:26.680]  Not the can't say.
[2:27:26.680 --> 2:27:28.680]  That was an a denny's.
[2:27:28.680 --> 2:27:33.680]  The parking lot the parking lot of the.
[2:27:33.680 --> 2:27:42.680]  No but he he made an unannounced surprise appearance on stage at the Cisco thing I got like some email about it but I don't know that's been publicized.
[2:27:42.680 --> 2:27:51.680]  But you know he spoke and apparently a great length and it was really really interest and it made a very compelling case for you know like that the iPad.
[2:27:51.680 --> 2:27:59.680]  We've only reached the tip of the iceberg but it's it's going to play a tremendous role in business computing going forward.
[2:27:59.680 --> 2:28:11.680]  Like that I really do I think he believes it I think he I think he really thinks it's true so I really and I really think that he himself is is going to use an iPad pro a lot.
[2:28:11.680 --> 2:28:25.680]  And I think that he he seems so interested in it personally I can't see why they how they wouldn't put a lot of time into the unveiling of it you know the added event and again I don't see how they fit that in one event next week.
[2:28:25.680 --> 2:28:37.680]  So and the the WWE just ahead off this possible I mean I could be wrong because I know German is saying it's coming next week or that it's planned to and John Patzkowski said that too.
[2:28:37.680 --> 2:28:49.680]  But Patzkowski said the same thing last year again August like when he same thing like when when he got the the leak of the date for the September event.
[2:28:49.680 --> 2:28:58.680]  He said you know that it's expected to be new phones and the apples yeah what we then called their wearable and new iPads.
[2:28:58.680 --> 2:29:04.680]  Well the one thing the one thing that goes against our argument though is the size of the venue.
[2:29:04.680 --> 2:29:06.680]  All right all right hold on.
[2:29:06.680 --> 2:29:08.680]  I have an explanation on it.
[2:29:08.680 --> 2:29:09.680]  Yes.
[2:29:09.680 --> 2:29:11.680]  I have an explanation I hold that thought.
[2:29:11.680 --> 2:29:18.680]  The other counter argument is that the WWDC keynote this year went over two hours well over two hours.
[2:29:18.680 --> 2:29:19.680]  Yeah.
[2:29:19.680 --> 2:29:21.680]  So why not just go over two hours again.
[2:29:21.680 --> 2:29:24.680]  I don't think they were happy that that went over two hours.
[2:29:24.680 --> 2:29:29.680]  I think that you know should have been.
[2:29:29.680 --> 2:29:39.680]  You know I've been a bit jam fact that really I'll follow the exciting information that that hold the whole Apple music thing was talking to you know some.
[2:29:39.680 --> 2:29:49.680]  You know there were some Apple people who you know obviously it's off the record you know but you know more or less we're like hey sorry about this.
[2:29:49.680 --> 2:30:02.680]  You know what Ben Thompson and I went we're sitting together for it and we were like we we asked a friend you know like we were like the word was that it was going to be long that's and we I asked somebody I know who who would know.
[2:30:02.680 --> 2:30:17.680]  You know someone from Apple PR and it was like hey should we should we run to the bat because running to the bathroom at WWDC is kind of a pain in the ass because there's so many thousands of people streaming in like the secret is to go all the way downstairs don't you know the keynotes on the third level don't go to that.
[2:30:17.680 --> 2:30:20.680]  Don't go to the one that's closest go further right.
[2:30:20.680 --> 2:30:31.680]  Yeah like a funny side story is Ben and I both like we're like oh we better go so we like went and you know we you know a couple minutes ago before the keynote goes we went down to the first floor to you know hit the restroom.
[2:30:31.680 --> 2:30:33.680]  Glad that I did.
[2:30:33.680 --> 2:30:35.680]  It's a son of a picture in law.
[2:30:35.680 --> 2:30:41.680]  If anything is we come back upstairs and we get to the third floor and the door to the men's room was out way out the door.
[2:30:41.680 --> 2:30:52.680]  I mean there must have been a hundred hundred guys waiting in line to go to the the men's room on the third floor of Moscone and Ben I see me I don't I don't I'm not a two-manitarian I was just going to go take my seat.
[2:30:52.680 --> 2:31:00.680]  Ben stopped and so was Ben is a very nice guy and started telling people he was like hey you know you can just go down to the first floor and there's no line.
[2:31:00.680 --> 2:31:05.680]  There's literally no line in the first four men's room and every nobody took his advice and they were scared.
[2:31:05.680 --> 2:31:07.680]  Yeah they were scared that it was like so good.
[2:31:07.680 --> 2:31:09.680]  It was a scam.
[2:31:09.680 --> 2:31:10.680]  Yeah.
[2:31:10.680 --> 2:31:11.680]  Yeah.
[2:31:11.680 --> 2:31:19.680]  And Ben like took it hard he's like I you know and I was like this is why it doesn't pay to help people Ben doesn't pay.
[2:31:19.680 --> 2:31:23.680]  But anyway I don't think they were happy that that went over two hours.
[2:31:23.680 --> 2:31:29.680]  They just felt like this is what we have to do at WWDC this year and they needed to you know they felt like they needed to get Apple music announced.
[2:31:29.680 --> 2:31:37.680]  And so therefore it had to be over two hours I feel like they they they're internal goal to keep them all under two hours.
[2:31:37.680 --> 2:31:44.680]  You know they'll make an exception if they feel like they need to but if they don't need to they won't and I feel like they don't need to this time why they don't have to do.
[2:31:44.680 --> 2:31:45.680]  Right.
[2:31:45.680 --> 2:31:48.680]  It would be breaking the pattern to do that.
[2:31:48.680 --> 2:31:49.680]  Yeah.
[2:31:49.680 --> 2:31:50.680]  Yeah.
[2:31:50.680 --> 2:31:51.680]  All right.
[2:31:51.680 --> 2:31:52.680]  What was the thing I said we get back to.
[2:31:52.680 --> 2:31:53.680]  Oh the venue.
[2:31:53.680 --> 2:32:00.680]  So the venue is Bill Graham Civic Auditorium I've never been there.
[2:32:00.680 --> 2:32:03.680]  I don't know I'm not even quite I hope I get there.
[2:32:03.680 --> 2:32:08.680]  If you do go to the bathroom in the basement even if there even if there's no bathroom down there.
[2:32:08.680 --> 2:32:09.680]  Well.
[2:32:09.680 --> 2:32:16.680]  So it's a huge place and I guess it can be configured to fill it fill thousands of people.
[2:32:16.680 --> 2:32:24.680]  But my understanding and again I this is just a sort of you know lick my finger and put it in a win.
[2:32:24.680 --> 2:32:31.680]  But it sounds to me like they they haven't really increased the number of people invited.
[2:32:31.680 --> 2:32:38.680]  Like it doesn't seem like pressing for the patients or all that easy to get.
[2:32:38.680 --> 2:32:45.680]  Which makes it sound like there's not now it could be that they are going to have thousands and thousands of people or whatever but that they've invited people from China or
[2:32:45.680 --> 2:32:51.680]  that it's a bunch of people from the TV industry you know like people who write about TV and Hollywood reporters.
[2:32:51.680 --> 2:32:58.680]  And so that I wouldn't know this because they haven't increased the number of you know the people I know in the tech people.
[2:32:58.680 --> 2:33:00.680]  Well I didn't get an invite.
[2:33:00.680 --> 2:33:07.680]  There you go see but that's just here's my my thinking is that maybe the reason they have this big venue.
[2:33:07.680 --> 2:33:09.680]  I don't know what it even looks like inside.
[2:33:09.680 --> 2:33:15.680]  You know I could be that this doesn't need this what I'm going to say doesn't make any sense but remember last year.
[2:33:15.680 --> 2:33:23.680]  They built this big white box in front of the Flint Center down there in Cupertino.
[2:33:23.680 --> 2:33:30.680]  And nobody knew what it was and it was a big demo area a big temporary demo area for all the new stuff they wanted to show.
[2:33:30.680 --> 2:33:39.680]  Like a one day two hour Apple store just for demonstrating the new watching everything.
[2:33:39.680 --> 2:33:44.680]  My thought is what if they did that again this year but they wanted to do it all indoors.
[2:33:44.680 --> 2:33:52.680]  That maybe that's why they haven't in this huge area so that there may not be tons of press seating or seating for people to see the event.
[2:33:52.680 --> 2:33:56.680]  But that they've built like a big area to demonstrate this.
[2:33:56.680 --> 2:34:06.680]  I think just thinking about it if you want to demonstrate Apple TV in a realistic way you need a lot of people to have a lot of space because you have a bunch of TVs.
[2:34:06.680 --> 2:34:09.680]  Yeah and maybe like couches set up or something.
[2:34:09.680 --> 2:34:13.680]  You know sit down and watch a ball game or something.
[2:34:13.680 --> 2:34:17.680]  So that's my guess my guess is just and just a guess.
[2:34:17.680 --> 2:34:22.680]  I mean how the hell did I know I don't know what the hell's going on in the bill Graham Civic.
[2:34:22.680 --> 2:34:28.680]  My guess is that they've built a big huge hands on area inside and that's why it's in a big venue.
[2:34:28.680 --> 2:34:30.680]  Not because they're inviting lots of people.
[2:34:30.680 --> 2:34:34.680]  Okay well not that they're not inviting lots of people even if you know.
[2:34:34.680 --> 2:34:42.680]  Yeah I was assuming that it was going to be all the way through iPads but but now that we've talked I think I'm going to say that we're right.
[2:34:42.680 --> 2:34:44.680]  Yeah that it's not that iPads are going to be next month.
[2:34:44.680 --> 2:34:50.680]  I'm also predicting I'll predict that Mark Gurman will say that he wasn't wrong about the iPads.
[2:34:50.680 --> 2:34:56.680]  He'll say he was right but that they moved them to October because it leaked that they were going to come out.
[2:34:56.680 --> 2:34:59.680]  Because his report that they leaked.
[2:34:59.680 --> 2:35:01.680]  That's unfair.
[2:35:01.680 --> 2:35:02.680]  Is it unfair?
[2:35:02.680 --> 2:35:05.680]  It only happened well did that happen more than once?
[2:35:05.680 --> 2:35:09.680]  No it's just with the design of just the ones.
[2:35:09.680 --> 2:35:13.680]  The healthcare health app design.
[2:35:13.680 --> 2:35:14.680]  Right.
[2:35:14.680 --> 2:35:19.680]  But that he wasn't wrong he was he was right and they moved it out of spite.
[2:35:19.680 --> 2:35:22.680]  They are very spiteful.
[2:35:22.680 --> 2:35:35.680]  And again if they and I just emphasized that they could I guess squeeze in iPad but then if they do then there's nothing left to have an event for El Capitan and any new Macs that they want to unveil.
[2:35:35.680 --> 2:35:36.680]  Yeah right.
[2:35:36.680 --> 2:35:46.680]  And I thought it was interesting I thought it was interesting too that Gurman even said that he said that he thinks that the iPad sources say the iPad is supposed to come out at this event this week.
[2:35:46.680 --> 2:35:53.680]  But then he himself said that the new retina 21 inch iMac is coming in October.
[2:35:53.680 --> 2:36:03.680]  And it's like you know a new I knew cool new retina iMac coming in October sure sounds like a perfect thing to announce at an event in October.
[2:36:03.680 --> 2:36:04.680]  Right.
[2:36:04.680 --> 2:36:05.680]  Yeah.
[2:36:05.680 --> 2:36:06.680]  So anyway.
[2:36:06.680 --> 2:36:08.680]  You think but.
[2:36:08.680 --> 2:36:10.680]  That'll be interesting.
[2:36:10.680 --> 2:36:11.680]  Yeah.
[2:36:11.680 --> 2:36:13.680]  Anything else?
[2:36:13.680 --> 2:36:14.680]  I think that's enough.
[2:36:14.680 --> 2:36:15.680]  Yeah that's pretty good.
[2:36:15.680 --> 2:36:17.680]  I think that's enough too.
[2:36:17.680 --> 2:36:18.680]  That's just enough.
[2:36:18.680 --> 2:36:19.680]  Just enough.
[2:36:19.680 --> 2:36:20.680]  Just enough.
[2:36:20.680 --> 2:36:21.680]  All right John.
[2:36:21.680 --> 2:36:22.680]  Exactly the right amount.
