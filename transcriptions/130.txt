[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  A friend of the show, Paul Kufasas, texted me earlier today with an interesting question,
[00:06.000 --> 00:13.080]  and he said, if you heard somebody say that an outfielder went, quote, full Kansako on
[00:13.080 --> 00:18.880]  a ball, what does that mean to you?
[00:18.880 --> 00:20.320]  I'm not sure I know.
[00:20.320 --> 00:24.440]  I like the thought experiment, though.
[00:24.440 --> 00:29.480]  I got it, because I can never forget this play.
[00:29.480 --> 00:33.400]  It was a play when Jose Kansako was on the Texas Rangers.
[00:33.400 --> 00:38.740]  He was playing right field, and there was what should have been a routine fly ball out
[00:38.740 --> 00:39.740]  of the warning track.
[00:39.740 --> 00:47.680]  He lost it, and it hit him on the head and bounced over for a home run.
[00:47.680 --> 00:49.800]  That seems impossible.
[00:49.800 --> 00:52.720]  That's got to be.
[00:52.720 --> 00:56.160]  I will put the link in the show notes, I swear to God.
[00:56.160 --> 00:59.280]  I will send it to you now.
[00:59.280 --> 01:05.760]  It does sound impossible, but it did happen, and I think you could probably, if you had
[01:05.760 --> 01:09.840]  the right math degree, you could probably prove mathematically that it could only have
[01:09.840 --> 01:13.160]  happened to Jose Kansako.
[01:13.160 --> 01:22.400]  That's the second thing on YouTube, the second search criteria for Jose Kansako.
[01:22.400 --> 01:28.200]  The first is just Jose Kansako, and the second is Jose Kansako, ball hits head.
[01:28.200 --> 01:36.480]  Wait, what the heck is that?
[01:36.480 --> 01:38.720]  I got the audio from your video, so.
[01:38.720 --> 01:39.720]  I don't want to.
[01:39.720 --> 01:40.720]  Yeah.
[01:40.720 --> 01:41.720]  Oh, did what?
[01:41.720 --> 01:42.720]  No, this is great.
[01:42.720 --> 01:43.720]  I'm listening.
[01:43.720 --> 01:47.080]  That was the ad.
[01:47.080 --> 01:48.080]  Here he goes.
[01:48.080 --> 01:49.080]  Here he goes.
[01:49.080 --> 01:50.080]  He's going back.
[01:50.080 --> 01:56.520]  He's going back thong.
[01:56.520 --> 02:00.440]  You think you'd have to try to do that now or that you'd have to try to do it on purpose,
[02:00.440 --> 02:01.440]  right?
[02:01.440 --> 02:04.260]  I mean, I'm not even sure if you could do it on purpose, but.
[02:04.260 --> 02:10.900]  So what happened was that yesterday or I guess it was yesterday, Toronto Blue Jays left fielder
[02:10.900 --> 02:17.680]  Ben Revere was trying to catch a fly ball hit by the Orioles, Matt Wieters, and it was
[02:17.680 --> 02:23.240]  it was going to hit the wall about an about a foot short and he jumped up to catch it
[02:23.240 --> 02:27.120]  and it hit his glove and and went over for a home run.
[02:27.120 --> 02:28.880]  So it would not have been a home run.
[02:28.880 --> 02:33.000]  It would have been about a foot foot short and it instead was because he tried to catch
[02:33.000 --> 02:34.000]  it his glove.
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.760]  To me, that's not a full Kansako that that to me is like a half Kansako like it's got
[02:38.760 --> 02:39.760]  to hit your rights.
[02:39.760 --> 02:40.760]  It's got to hit your head.
[02:40.760 --> 02:44.640]  Got to hit your head or some other, but I mean, you know, I'm not sure if there's anything
[02:44.640 --> 02:47.860]  else more comical than the head that would actually work.
[02:47.860 --> 02:55.360]  I think you're debasing the beauty of that play by calling it a Kansako.
[02:55.360 --> 02:56.360]  A full.
[02:56.360 --> 02:57.360]  Yeah.
[02:57.360 --> 02:58.360]  Yeah.
[02:58.360 --> 02:59.360]  Yeah.
[02:59.360 --> 03:00.360]  That's a half.
[03:00.360 --> 03:01.360]  That's a half at best.
[03:01.360 --> 03:02.360]  That's a half.
[03:02.360 --> 03:03.360]  I can't say the other.
[03:03.360 --> 03:04.360]  That should be.
[03:04.360 --> 03:06.480]  That should be the official scoring, actually.
[03:06.480 --> 03:10.680]  The other link that came up when I went to Google it, when you type in Jose Kansako and
[03:10.680 --> 03:13.120]  that is a fun it's a very fun game.
[03:13.120 --> 03:17.560]  What autocompletes the other one that came out was Jose Kansako.
[03:17.560 --> 03:18.920]  Knocked out.
[03:18.920 --> 03:22.600]  And when that when that autocompleted, I thought I was like, holy cow.
[03:22.600 --> 03:24.040]  So I misremembered the play.
[03:24.040 --> 03:27.000]  I was like, I don't remember him getting knocked out on that play.
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.000]  I thought that it just went over and, you know, he was OK.
[03:30.000 --> 03:31.680]  Turns out it's a different video.
[03:31.680 --> 03:37.920]  He was in a celebrity boxing match and got knocked out in the first round.
[03:37.920 --> 03:38.920]  Naturally.
[03:38.920 --> 03:39.920]  Yeah.
[03:39.920 --> 03:42.800]  Naturally, he was a man.
[03:42.800 --> 03:44.600]  Who is he fighting?
[03:44.600 --> 03:48.440]  Vi Sykahima, former Philadelphia Eagles.
[03:48.440 --> 03:56.200]  I think he was like a safety and like a kick returner and is now, in fact, a beloved local
[03:56.200 --> 04:01.160]  sportscaster here and here in Philly by Sykahima.
[04:01.160 --> 04:02.160]  Believe he's Hawaiian.
[04:02.160 --> 04:03.160]  Oh, my God.
[04:03.160 --> 04:04.160]  Yeah.
[04:04.160 --> 04:09.000]  Beloved for having having knocked out Jose Kansako.
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.000]  Exactly.
[04:11.000 --> 04:19.720]  I guess he I guess Kansako used to play at the for the local for our local team here
[04:19.720 --> 04:24.040]  for the Rainiers, actually, because he was he was he was in the A's, right?
[04:24.040 --> 04:25.040]  Yeah.
[04:25.040 --> 04:26.040]  Yeah.
[04:26.040 --> 04:27.040]  Yeah.
[04:27.040 --> 04:28.040]  Yeah.
[04:28.040 --> 04:29.040]  Yeah.
[04:29.040 --> 04:30.040]  Because it used to be the Rainiers used to be an A's farm team before they became a Mariners
[04:30.040 --> 04:31.040]  from team.
[04:31.040 --> 04:36.720]  And so I remember going to a game one night and I'm pretty sure I get the like the gift
[04:36.720 --> 04:41.200]  that the thing, you know, if you get the first 100 people or whatever was a Jose Kansako
[04:41.200 --> 04:42.200]  bubble head doll.
[04:42.200 --> 04:48.600]  That's a good name for a local team named after your local mountaintop mountain Rainier.
[04:48.600 --> 04:49.600]  Yeah.
[04:49.600 --> 04:50.600]  Unless they rename the mountain.
[04:50.600 --> 04:51.600]  Yeah.
[04:51.600 --> 04:52.600]  Well, that happens nowadays.
[04:52.600 --> 04:53.600]  Right.
[04:53.600 --> 04:54.600]  That's right.
[04:54.600 --> 04:55.600]  Yeah.
[04:55.600 --> 04:56.600]  Which I think they should.
[04:56.600 --> 04:58.600]  But, you know, that's OK.
[04:58.600 --> 04:59.920]  What a funny story that is.
[04:59.920 --> 05:05.580]  I'm guessing those people have heard this, but it's it's there was a mountain in Alaska
[05:05.580 --> 05:09.020]  and that everybody in Alaska calls it Denali.
[05:09.020 --> 05:14.280]  And it's the like the indigenous name that, you know, they've been calling it that since,
[05:14.280 --> 05:17.460]  you know, I don't know, hundreds of years or whatever.
[05:17.460 --> 05:23.380]  And then at some point, a hundred years ago, some point a white man shows up, a white man
[05:23.380 --> 05:28.240]  shows up and they named it Mount McKinley after President McKinley, who quite frankly
[05:28.240 --> 05:29.800]  was not a very good president.
[05:29.800 --> 05:30.800]  No.
[05:30.800 --> 05:32.920]  And in fact, this is the part I did not know.
[05:32.920 --> 05:37.120]  I'd never even stepped foot in Alaska.
[05:37.120 --> 05:40.660]  And so it was a long way to go back then.
[05:40.660 --> 05:48.960]  President Barack Obama renamed it to Denali and to what it was originally named.
[05:48.960 --> 05:49.960]  Right.
[05:49.960 --> 05:56.040]  And it's such a weird story because so much in U.S. politics is just knee jerk, left right,
[05:56.040 --> 05:57.680]  Republican, Democrat, you know, anything.
[05:57.680 --> 06:03.160]  You know, Obama, you know, orders a hamburger and and Republicans complain that he didn't
[06:03.160 --> 06:05.160]  get a cheeseburger.
[06:05.160 --> 06:06.860]  Right.
[06:06.860 --> 06:09.280]  And instead, though, this is very strange.
[06:09.280 --> 06:13.480]  Everybody in Alaska, whether they're Republican or Democrat, is very happy about this because
[06:13.480 --> 06:17.320]  it's apparently been like a sticking point for a long time because, you know, they don't
[06:17.320 --> 06:18.320]  like it.
[06:18.320 --> 06:22.760]  And people in Ohio, which is the home state of President McKinley, are very, very, very
[06:22.760 --> 06:25.760]  upset.
[06:25.760 --> 06:28.040]  Too bad.
[06:28.040 --> 06:30.640]  Name one of your little mountains in Ohio, Mount McKinley.
[06:30.640 --> 06:32.240]  Right now, the really exactly.
[06:32.240 --> 06:33.240]  Yeah.
[06:33.240 --> 06:34.240]  Yeah.
[06:34.240 --> 06:35.240]  McKinley Hill.
[06:35.240 --> 06:36.240]  Yeah.
[06:36.240 --> 06:46.360]  So it's the Rainier is actually, I believe, to Houma in whatever the I did, which which
[06:46.360 --> 06:49.520]  native which native language it is, if it's or if it's all of them, if they all called
[06:49.520 --> 06:51.400]  it the same thing.
[06:51.400 --> 06:52.400]  So basically the same.
[06:52.400 --> 06:53.800]  I mean, the same name as Tacoma.
[06:53.800 --> 06:54.800]  Right.
[06:54.800 --> 06:55.800]  Yeah.
[06:55.800 --> 06:56.800]  I did not know that.
[06:56.800 --> 06:57.800]  Yeah.
[06:57.800 --> 06:58.800]  Well, there you go.
[06:58.800 --> 06:59.800]  So they should change that.
[06:59.800 --> 07:02.680]  And then the team could be the Tacoma to Houmas.
[07:02.680 --> 07:03.680]  Oh, my God.
[07:03.680 --> 07:06.200]  That'd be great.
[07:06.200 --> 07:09.160]  That would be a good way to get on SportsCenter on a regular basis.
[07:09.160 --> 07:10.160]  Right.
[07:10.160 --> 07:12.040]  They're not getting there.
[07:12.040 --> 07:13.040]  The way they're playing right now.
[07:13.040 --> 07:14.040]  Right.
[07:14.040 --> 07:17.840]  Actually, I don't know how well the Rainiers are doing, but their parent team is not doing
[07:17.840 --> 07:18.840]  that well.
[07:18.840 --> 07:19.840]  All right.
[07:19.840 --> 07:24.600]  I tried to explain to Jonas the other day about you remember Dick Trickle?
[07:24.600 --> 07:25.600]  Remember the name?
[07:25.600 --> 07:26.880]  He was a NASCAR driver.
[07:26.880 --> 07:31.040]  He was like a mediocre NASCAR NASCAR driver.
[07:31.040 --> 07:34.200]  Did not have a great win record or anything like that.
[07:34.200 --> 07:42.280]  But in the late 90s, when like Keith Olbermann and Dan Patrick were doing SportsCenter, I
[07:42.280 --> 07:43.720]  guess it was like the middle 90s.
[07:43.720 --> 07:47.080]  And it's every night at eleven o'clock, those two guys who went on, you know, they're two
[07:47.080 --> 07:50.520]  of the top sportscasters in the country now.
[07:50.520 --> 07:54.680]  Whenever they reported NASCAR results, they would say who came in first, who came in second
[07:54.680 --> 07:57.000]  and where did Dick Trickle finish?
[07:57.000 --> 08:02.420]  So it'd be like, you know, so and so came in first, so and so is second and Dick Trickle
[08:02.420 --> 08:05.480]  finished twenty eighth.
[08:05.480 --> 08:07.520]  And it was every single week.
[08:07.520 --> 08:08.640]  It was so great.
[08:08.640 --> 08:11.880]  And they never of course, they never said why.
[08:11.880 --> 08:13.800]  And I really had to.
[08:13.800 --> 08:15.800]  Jonas did not believe me.
[08:15.800 --> 08:20.680]  He really had to like Google the guy and like look up his Wikipedia and and you can even
[08:20.680 --> 08:25.480]  find, if you Google him, you know, references to the fact that he was always mentioned on
[08:25.480 --> 08:26.480]  sports.
[08:26.480 --> 08:27.480]  Oh, my God.
[08:27.480 --> 08:29.800]  So that you need a catchy name like that.
[08:29.800 --> 08:33.080]  If you're you know, if you're not going to win, if you're only a minor league franchise,
[08:33.080 --> 08:36.640]  you need a good name like that to come that and that would have been a good baseball name
[08:36.640 --> 08:37.640]  to.
[08:37.640 --> 08:38.640]  Yeah.
[08:38.640 --> 08:39.640]  Yeah.
[08:39.640 --> 08:40.640]  Dick Trickle.
[08:40.640 --> 08:41.640]  Yeah.
[08:41.640 --> 08:42.640]  He should have put a baseball player.
[08:42.640 --> 08:43.640]  Right.
[08:43.640 --> 08:44.640]  Would have been maybe that was it.
[08:44.640 --> 08:45.640]  Maybe that was he missed his calling.
[08:45.640 --> 08:50.840]  Maybe that was a relief pitcher like Raleigh Fingers, right?
[08:50.840 --> 08:51.840]  Late innings.
[08:51.840 --> 08:52.840]  Late innings.
[08:52.840 --> 08:53.840]  Dick Trickle.
[08:53.840 --> 08:57.100]  In comes Dick Trickle.
[08:57.100 --> 08:58.640]  Dick Trickle warming up in the bullpen.
[08:58.640 --> 09:01.120]  Oh, thank God we have nothing real to talk about.
[09:01.120 --> 09:02.120]  No, no.
[09:02.120 --> 09:07.640]  Where do you want to start?
[09:07.640 --> 09:10.320]  Let's just get the Google logo thing out of the way.
[09:10.320 --> 09:11.320]  OK.
[09:11.320 --> 09:12.880]  That's why I brought in noted graphic designer.
[09:12.880 --> 09:13.880]  Yeah.
[09:13.880 --> 09:20.600]  I was kind of wondering why I was I was being brought on, but please continue probably because
[09:20.600 --> 09:30.120]  you wanted somebody who knew less than you and I knew much more much less than than you.
[09:30.120 --> 09:36.000]  I here's the so Google change their logo last week and I rather than right, I should I'm
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.140]  going to write sometime, you know, maybe it'll be when I get on the airplane, but at some
[09:40.140 --> 09:43.240]  point I've got to write a longer piece and I have a whole bunch of links saved up because
[09:43.240 --> 09:45.920]  other people are writing about it.
[09:45.920 --> 09:49.800]  But my take on it, I read your take.
[09:49.800 --> 09:50.800]  All right.
[09:50.800 --> 09:51.800]  I went short and sweet.
[09:51.800 --> 09:52.800]  Yeah.
[09:52.800 --> 09:57.440]  And I said they're all way I better I was going to do it from memory.
[09:57.440 --> 10:02.120]  It's pretty short, but I better see I'll just search my home page for garbage.
[10:02.120 --> 10:03.120]  There it is.
[10:03.120 --> 10:04.120]  OK.
[10:04.120 --> 10:05.260]  Their old logo was goofy.
[10:05.260 --> 10:07.720]  This new one is simply garbage.
[10:07.720 --> 10:10.600]  Just right for a company with no taste.
[10:10.600 --> 10:14.800]  I know that's harsh, but I meant I truly mean every word of that.
[10:14.800 --> 10:15.800]  I really do.
[10:15.800 --> 10:17.800]  I think it is a garbage logo.
[10:17.800 --> 10:18.800]  I really do.
[10:18.800 --> 10:20.800]  I think it is terrible.
[10:20.800 --> 10:22.840]  And well, there's two there's two new things, right?
[10:22.840 --> 10:25.720]  There's a new the name is written differently.
[10:25.720 --> 10:26.720]  Yes.
[10:26.720 --> 10:28.920]  And then they also have a logo, which they didn't have before.
[10:28.920 --> 10:30.720]  Am I right about that?
[10:30.720 --> 10:35.000]  What would the what is the logo supposed to be like the circle things?
[10:35.000 --> 10:36.000]  Yeah.
[10:36.000 --> 10:37.000]  So there's like a circle.
[10:37.000 --> 10:38.000]  Yeah.
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.640]  So let's take a look in the what is it?
[10:40.640 --> 10:43.360]  What's that little thing up in the URL line?
[10:43.360 --> 10:44.360]  The favicon?
[10:44.360 --> 10:45.360]  Yeah.
[10:45.360 --> 10:46.360]  The favicon.
[10:46.360 --> 10:47.360]  Right.
[10:47.360 --> 10:48.360]  Yeah.
[10:48.360 --> 10:50.800]  So well, I'm not sure what was up there before.
[10:50.800 --> 10:53.680]  It was there was a G. It was a lowercase.
[10:53.680 --> 10:54.960]  I see a G now.
[10:54.960 --> 10:55.960]  I see a capital G.
[10:55.960 --> 10:56.960]  Yeah.
[10:56.960 --> 10:58.360]  But you see something great.
[10:58.360 --> 10:59.400]  It's got the colors.
[10:59.400 --> 11:01.720]  It's got the colors of the chrome icon.
[11:01.720 --> 11:02.720]  Yeah.
[11:02.720 --> 11:03.720]  Basically.
[11:03.720 --> 11:07.520]  Although actually, no, it's got blue because the chrome icon has blue in the middle.
[11:07.520 --> 11:08.520]  This one has it on the outside.
[11:08.520 --> 11:13.160]  So I thought it was just the chrome icon in the shape of a G, but it's not right.
[11:13.160 --> 11:16.880]  The only thing I would clarify about I will write more, but if I could if I could take
[11:16.880 --> 11:21.560]  my little short take again, I would the only thing I would add is that when I say their
[11:21.560 --> 11:28.120]  old logo was goofy, I that I realized that's an incomplete thought because it was goofy.
[11:28.120 --> 11:31.360]  But over the years, they had simplified it to a point where it was right.
[11:31.360 --> 11:34.400]  It was goofy, but goofy in the way that Google is goofy.
[11:34.400 --> 11:38.520]  And I mean, goofy like that, they're sort of a quirky odd.
[11:38.520 --> 11:41.240]  You know, that's part of their brand, right?
[11:41.240 --> 11:43.920]  Like this is my favorite moment in Google history.
[11:43.920 --> 11:48.960]  And I mean, this in total sincerity, whatever year it was when Gmail was announced, they
[11:48.960 --> 11:51.760]  announced it on April 1st.
[11:51.760 --> 11:59.040]  And and at the time, like if you went to like AOL dot com and signed up for a free email
[11:59.040 --> 12:04.080]  or Yahoo, I guess Yahoo and Hotmail were like the two that were most popular.
[12:04.080 --> 12:10.120]  You got a new, you know, free email account and like you got like 10 megabytes of storage
[12:10.120 --> 12:12.640]  or 15 megabytes of storage or something like that.
[12:12.640 --> 12:18.800]  And then on April 1st of like whatever year it was, 2006, 2007, whatever, Google announced
[12:18.800 --> 12:24.000]  that they have a new free email service called Gmail and you get like a gigabyte of storage.
[12:24.000 --> 12:29.240]  It was like 50 times the storage of these other services.
[12:29.240 --> 12:31.640]  And it was April 1st, which is Internet jackass day.
[12:31.640 --> 12:36.720]  And so I remember thinking like I think and I think this might be true.
[12:36.720 --> 12:43.800]  I think it's true that I've never once been taken in by an Internet jackass day hoax,
[12:43.800 --> 12:44.880]  I think.
[12:44.880 --> 12:49.040]  And if not, if I have been taken in, it hasn't been bad.
[12:49.040 --> 12:53.160]  Like I've never once, you know, and I do know it's a point of pride for me that I've never
[12:53.160 --> 12:54.160]  once been full.
[12:54.160 --> 12:57.560]  I remember like thinking like this is this is dastardly.
[12:57.560 --> 13:01.960]  I can't tell whether this is real or a joke and I didn't know what to do.
[13:01.960 --> 13:03.720]  I didn't know whether I should link to it.
[13:03.720 --> 13:07.000]  I didn't know whether I should link to it and just say, I don't know if this is a joke
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.740]  or not because it just seemed impossible.
[13:09.740 --> 13:12.420]  How could they give everybody a gigabyte of storage?
[13:12.420 --> 13:14.280]  And it turned out it was completely true.
[13:14.280 --> 13:15.880]  But I love that story.
[13:15.880 --> 13:17.720]  And I think that they I think that they did it.
[13:17.720 --> 13:20.560]  I've never heard whether it's true or not, but I think that's why they announced it on
[13:20.560 --> 13:25.120]  April 1st, because I think they knew that it would have that reaction, that part of
[13:25.120 --> 13:28.360]  the reaction to the announcement of Gmail was the.
[13:28.360 --> 13:29.360]  Are they kidding?
[13:29.360 --> 13:30.360]  Is this for real?
[13:30.360 --> 13:31.360]  Yeah, yeah.
[13:31.360 --> 13:36.440]  Well, and that's the best thing to do on April 1st, right, because everybody's so sick of
[13:36.440 --> 13:47.240]  April 1st being full of these dumb Microsoft buys so-and-so and the real trick is to do
[13:47.240 --> 13:48.240]  the opposite.
[13:48.240 --> 13:49.240]  Right.
[13:49.240 --> 13:52.680]  I mean, the real the better gag is to do the exact opposite, announce something that's
[13:52.680 --> 13:56.020]  completely true, that seems like it's probably not.
[13:56.020 --> 14:01.020]  And to me, it just epitomizes what is great and fun about Google that they can do.
[14:01.020 --> 14:03.080]  They have amazing technology.
[14:03.080 --> 14:07.080]  They have they think big, right?
[14:07.080 --> 14:10.640]  Instead of thinking like, let's double Yahoo's storage.
[14:10.640 --> 14:16.520]  They were like, let's give a hundred times a hundred times.
[14:16.520 --> 14:17.520]  They think big.
[14:17.520 --> 14:18.520]  They're not afraid.
[14:18.520 --> 14:21.840]  You know, they have that sort of ambition in the imagination.
[14:21.840 --> 14:25.560]  And they have this weird sense of humor where I wouldn't have put it past them to do it
[14:25.560 --> 14:27.320]  as a joke.
[14:27.320 --> 14:28.320]  And they do.
[14:28.320 --> 14:33.000]  They are a company that does do jokes on April 1st, you know, like Apple, for example, never
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.060]  does April 1st jokes and shouldn't.
[14:37.060 --> 14:39.580]  It would be it would be terrible.
[14:39.580 --> 14:42.600]  But you know, I hate all that good.
[14:42.600 --> 14:43.600]  They're not that good at jokes.
[14:43.600 --> 14:45.560]  They should probably not try that.
[14:45.560 --> 14:46.560]  Right.
[14:46.560 --> 14:51.400]  I don't think Google's jokes are that good either, but, you know, they do them.
[14:51.400 --> 14:54.760]  But it's right for Google's brand that they do them, you know, and the fact that I don't
[14:54.760 --> 14:58.340]  really care for those jokes is just one of those reasons why I just am more of an Apple
[14:58.340 --> 14:59.660]  person than a Google person.
[14:59.660 --> 15:05.880]  But anyway, all of that is to say is that where their logo was before, like up until
[15:05.880 --> 15:11.040]  last week was to me, it was goofy, but goofy in the right way.
[15:11.040 --> 15:14.540]  And it looked, you know, it had like a certain stateliness to it.
[15:14.540 --> 15:20.720]  And the fact that it was this sort of weird old timey serif font that nobody really uses
[15:20.720 --> 15:21.720]  anymore.
[15:21.720 --> 15:29.560]  It was just like a weird quirk, but it was instantly recognizable and, you know, all
[15:29.560 --> 15:30.560]  in a good way.
[15:30.560 --> 15:34.380]  And I think that it it was it just had the right tone.
[15:34.380 --> 15:35.980]  It was their old logo.
[15:35.980 --> 15:39.040]  So calling it goofy and leaving it at that makes it sound like I was putting their old
[15:39.040 --> 15:45.320]  logo down to what I meant is that their old logo was goofy appropriately.
[15:45.320 --> 15:50.160]  And you know, and so you can criticize it as in and of itself as a logo.
[15:50.160 --> 15:53.780]  And a lot of the people who have written pieces supporting the new logo, you know, they're
[15:53.780 --> 15:58.600]  correct in all the ways that their old logo was kind of weird and, you know, in and of
[15:58.600 --> 15:59.600]  itself wasn't good.
[15:59.600 --> 16:03.220]  But I think it was really good for Google.
[16:03.220 --> 16:07.280]  And this new one, to me, it's just it's so childish looking.
[16:07.280 --> 16:10.040]  It's it's it's ridiculous.
[16:10.040 --> 16:11.360]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[16:11.360 --> 16:16.720]  And it's I think it's you think it's how do you think it's childish because it looks like
[16:16.720 --> 16:19.280]  those those letters that you put on refrigerators?
[16:19.280 --> 16:20.280]  Yeah.
[16:20.280 --> 16:27.320]  It just to me, the tone of these shapes of letters, the the the complete geometric roundness
[16:27.320 --> 16:33.180]  of these letters and like and the best letter to look at to me is the lowercase g, which
[16:33.180 --> 16:38.240]  is really, really to me, like a kindergarten looking lowercase g like the type of g you
[16:38.240 --> 16:43.480]  would, you know, put up in front of a kid learning to write for the first time.
[16:43.480 --> 16:47.800]  I mean, the O's are just perfect circles, so it's hard to complain about them, but but
[16:47.800 --> 16:53.360]  just the G is really where it stands out as very, very childish looking.
[16:53.360 --> 16:55.440]  And I don't think that's good at all.
[16:55.440 --> 17:01.180]  I mean, other people have pointed out that it's it's extremely similar to the like the
[17:01.180 --> 17:03.720]  four colored G logo that they have now.
[17:03.720 --> 17:10.600]  Uppercase G is very, very similar to a logo that Jim Berry had used for a decade.
[17:10.600 --> 17:13.600]  And I don't think it's a problem in that they rip them off.
[17:13.600 --> 17:17.920]  It's not you know, there's there's only so many ways to do primary colors, which already
[17:17.920 --> 17:20.240]  was part of Google's brand.
[17:20.240 --> 17:24.160]  You know, the blue, red, yellow, green.
[17:24.160 --> 17:28.240]  If you're going to stick to these primary like, you know, right out of the a color Crayola
[17:28.240 --> 17:35.040]  box look and do a uppercase G, there's only so many ways to do it so that I wouldn't call
[17:35.040 --> 17:36.160]  it a rip off.
[17:36.160 --> 17:43.720]  But the fact that it is so similar in tone to a logo for a romper room for three year
[17:43.720 --> 17:50.600]  olds, it really, really says to me how childish it is as a brand.
[17:50.600 --> 17:55.200]  I really liked for example, with their old logo, I liked the way that when they made
[17:55.200 --> 18:01.440]  icons, like for example, like when they put a you know, the logo on the Google Maps icon,
[18:01.440 --> 18:07.680]  or their old favicon, that instead of using the first G, the uppercase G, they use the
[18:07.680 --> 18:09.960]  middle G, the lowercase one.
[18:09.960 --> 18:15.520]  And you knew that that was Google's G. It's like Google owned that lowercase g.
[18:15.520 --> 18:17.080]  And I thought that was a really cool way.
[18:17.080 --> 18:23.820]  And I thought it was very, very apt for their brand and the sort of tone of their company.
[18:23.820 --> 18:28.840]  Whereas now they're stuck with this uppercase G and it's very generic looking, yeah, generically
[18:28.840 --> 18:32.920]  childish.
[18:32.920 --> 18:38.120]  Part of the other part of your argument, the last part of your argument though, a company
[18:38.120 --> 18:39.440]  with no taste.
[18:39.440 --> 18:40.440]  Yeah.
[18:40.440 --> 18:47.280]  I think that's probably what most people got hung up on.
[18:47.280 --> 18:50.360]  Well I don't, they don't have taste though.
[18:50.360 --> 18:52.280]  I really, I firmly believe it.
[18:52.280 --> 18:56.300]  And there are, here's the, I guess the part that gets lost in there is there are pockets
[18:56.300 --> 19:02.400]  within Google where there are good designers working and obviously have taste because there
[19:02.400 --> 19:07.880]  are some products that they put out that are nicely designed.
[19:07.880 --> 19:13.200]  But institutionally they have no taste at all because some of their products are just
[19:13.200 --> 19:15.200]  horrendous.
[19:15.200 --> 19:20.080]  For example, I think Gmail just looks like, it looks like garbage and it always has.
[19:20.080 --> 19:25.680]  And I could never, I know probably a majority of the people listening to this show probably
[19:25.680 --> 19:32.640]  use Gmail and if not a majority, certainly a huge chunk use it and they use it right
[19:32.640 --> 19:34.840]  out of the web browser.
[19:34.840 --> 19:36.840]  That's how they do their email.
[19:36.840 --> 19:40.440]  I don't think anybody does that because they like the way it looks.
[19:40.440 --> 19:43.120]  They just like the way that it works.
[19:43.120 --> 19:44.240]  It looks terrible.
[19:44.240 --> 19:47.840]  It's just a jumbled ugly mess.
[19:47.840 --> 19:52.520]  And it's like one of their flagship products.
[19:52.520 --> 19:55.800]  I would say it's second only to web search.
[19:55.800 --> 20:00.680]  I guess I don't find their tastes any worse than anybody else's particularly other than
[20:00.680 --> 20:02.480]  with the possible exception of Apple.
[20:02.480 --> 20:06.400]  I mean obviously we prefer Apple so we're going to come down on the side that Apple
[20:06.400 --> 20:07.400]  has better taste.
[20:07.400 --> 20:14.600]  But I mean I think that, I mean I would say that that's probably not too much of an argument.
[20:14.600 --> 20:17.800]  I mean Apple is kind of the reverse, right?
[20:17.800 --> 20:22.500]  Occasionally they do have things that show poor taste often in their comments as opposed
[20:22.500 --> 20:24.960]  to their design.
[20:24.960 --> 20:30.680]  But by and large it's the opposite case for them.
[20:30.680 --> 20:33.740]  But the thing about Google, I just don't think that their taste is really any worse than
[20:33.740 --> 20:35.200]  Microsoft's or anybody else's.
[20:35.200 --> 20:38.680]  I don't think Microsoft has good taste either.
[20:38.680 --> 20:43.240]  Although I think they've evolved better taste than Google.
[20:43.240 --> 20:46.960]  I think Microsoft has, yeah, I think in recent years.
[20:46.960 --> 20:49.920]  Maybe they're showing it in the last few years.
[20:49.920 --> 20:53.240]  I would even say just look at their logo redesigns.
[20:53.240 --> 20:57.760]  I think that Microsoft redesigned their logo within the last few years too and I think
[20:57.760 --> 20:58.760]  for the better.
[20:58.760 --> 21:06.080]  I think that they've gotten to a mark now that they can stick with forever.
[21:06.080 --> 21:08.080]  I don't think it's great.
[21:08.080 --> 21:12.640]  There's nothing really that I would rave about Microsoft's current logo.
[21:12.640 --> 21:21.440]  But it was better than what they had before and it seems to fit their brand to me.
[21:21.440 --> 21:23.000]  And so that to me is a sign of taste.
[21:23.000 --> 21:26.520]  I mean one of the reactions I've gotten from people on Twitter and I almost can't believe
[21:26.520 --> 21:28.960]  that they exist in a world.
[21:28.960 --> 21:32.560]  I know there's people who don't care about logos and think that they don't matter or
[21:32.560 --> 21:33.560]  whatever.
[21:33.560 --> 21:36.400]  But why would those people follow me on Twitter?
[21:36.400 --> 21:38.800]  People have said, dude, it's just a logo.
[21:38.800 --> 21:39.800]  To get angry.
[21:39.800 --> 21:40.800]  That's right.
[21:40.800 --> 21:43.800]  To get angry, that's like saying who cares what font you pick.
[21:43.800 --> 21:46.400]  It's like, I don't know.
[21:46.400 --> 21:52.960]  In the apartment building that is my mind, love of typography and love of care about
[21:52.960 --> 21:58.280]  logos share a bedroom.
[21:58.280 --> 22:00.680]  It's to me, it's the same part of my brain.
[22:00.680 --> 22:05.280]  The same part of my brain lights up when I think about fonts as when I think about logos
[22:05.280 --> 22:06.800]  and branding.
[22:06.800 --> 22:09.320]  It's exactly the same part of my brain.
[22:09.320 --> 22:12.680]  And in some cases it's married together.
[22:12.680 --> 22:18.160]  Because in this case what I really don't like about Google's logo is the type of the word
[22:18.160 --> 22:22.120]  mark that they're using.
[22:22.120 --> 22:23.400]  I don't like it either.
[22:23.400 --> 22:28.000]  But this always happens to me is like I end up, these things get announced and a whole
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.280]  bunch of people lose their shit over it.
[22:30.280 --> 22:37.960]  And I look at it and I think often I will end up one way or the other saying, oh, I
[22:37.960 --> 22:38.960]  like it.
[22:38.960 --> 22:41.840]  And then someone will write a very thoughtful post on why I shouldn't like it and they'll
[22:41.840 --> 22:44.720]  think, oh yeah, okay, I can see that or the other way around.
[22:44.720 --> 22:50.040]  So I don't feel like, I feel lost in this world.
[22:50.040 --> 22:53.400]  But I did not like it on first glance.
[22:53.400 --> 22:58.480]  And also, I mean, I kind of understood why they did it because they've reorganized.
[22:58.480 --> 23:06.000]  But at the same time I still don't get, I think that companies tend to do that too much.
[23:06.000 --> 23:15.320]  And often it's a bad impulse to rush out and redesign your logo to reflect some sort of
[23:15.320 --> 23:18.840]  business reason that your customers really probably don't give a crap about.
[23:18.840 --> 23:22.080]  Yeah, that's a very interesting point.
[23:22.080 --> 23:26.000]  And now that you've said it, I have been thinking that like in the back of my head, I think
[23:26.000 --> 23:34.480]  you're exactly right, that it's inextricably tied to this alphabet parent company and honestly,
[23:34.480 --> 23:41.240]  and I know, I do care deeply about logos and I really do, you know, I do think that they
[23:41.240 --> 23:44.980]  matter or at least they can matter tremendously.
[23:44.980 --> 23:53.080]  Like I think, for example, the Apple logo is just, you can't put a value on it.
[23:53.080 --> 23:58.400]  It is incredibly valuable to the company and it's so meaningful to me that they can have
[23:58.400 --> 24:01.520]  these retail stores that don't even say the name of the store.
[24:01.520 --> 24:04.240]  They've never had a, you know, they've never put the name of the store anywhere.
[24:04.240 --> 24:10.120]  They just put this mark out in front and everybody knows what it is.
[24:10.120 --> 24:14.840]  And they can make laptops that have this mark when they're opened up.
[24:14.840 --> 24:18.740]  And you can just see that, you know, when you go into a coffee shop that everybody is
[24:18.740 --> 24:25.600]  using one of their laptops and it's incredibly valuable.
[24:25.600 --> 24:26.960]  Technically not their first logo.
[24:26.960 --> 24:29.400]  No, well, no, not officially.
[24:29.400 --> 24:34.160]  There's the, the, the old Newton, Newton's sitting under a tree, right?
[24:34.160 --> 24:36.520]  Which was a terrible logo.
[24:36.520 --> 24:40.760]  It was a very nice drawing.
[24:40.760 --> 24:43.040]  Doesn't really catch, doesn't really catch the eye though.
[24:43.040 --> 24:44.120]  I'll put it in the show notes.
[24:44.120 --> 24:48.880]  I bet most people listening have seen it, but if you haven't, you'll be shocked at the
[24:48.880 --> 24:52.640]  first Apple computer company logo.
[24:52.640 --> 24:53.640]  Very well drawn.
[24:53.640 --> 24:56.760]  It was very nice, but it is a terrible logo.
[24:56.760 --> 25:00.440]  Yeah, but that's interesting.
[25:00.440 --> 25:04.520]  I do think that it's in a, that they're changing the logo is inextricably tied to this sort
[25:04.520 --> 25:07.720]  of corporate reshuffling and honestly, and not to read too much into it.
[25:07.720 --> 25:10.440]  So all this said that I care about logo and that they matter.
[25:10.440 --> 25:13.240]  I actually do think that it is a sign.
[25:13.240 --> 25:15.640]  I can't articulate it logically.
[25:15.640 --> 25:21.440]  It's a feeling, but I, I just feel it, that it's a very bad sign for Google.
[25:21.440 --> 25:27.880]  Like to me, it's a sign that they've lost their way and that, you know, I don't have
[25:27.880 --> 25:28.880]  money in Google.
[25:28.880 --> 25:33.200]  I don't have any money in any individual companies, but if I did, I would think very, very seriously
[25:33.200 --> 25:36.320]  about, about selling my Google stock that I don't know.
[25:36.320 --> 25:40.960]  I think they might be in for some bad times ahead and it's not just the logo, it's the
[25:40.960 --> 25:41.960]  everything.
[25:41.960 --> 25:48.720]  It's like the fact that like Larry and Sergey, I think that's how you supposed to pronounce
[25:48.720 --> 25:49.720]  it.
[25:49.720 --> 25:52.880]  I've been calling them, pronouncing it a different way, but I got some, some email.
[25:52.880 --> 25:55.000]  Oh, that's a hard G Sergey Sergey.
[25:55.000 --> 25:56.000]  Okay.
[25:56.000 --> 26:03.280]  I didn't know that either, uh, that, you know, that they've seemingly, I've been thinking
[26:03.280 --> 26:04.760]  about this alphabet reshuffling.
[26:04.760 --> 26:08.380]  And to me, as I think about it, I think what it really means is that those two guys who
[26:08.380 --> 26:13.320]  could do whatever they want, cause a they're filthy rich, be the way that they, the ingenious
[26:13.320 --> 26:16.900]  way that they've structured the stock for the company, they can do whatever they want
[26:16.900 --> 26:17.900]  with the company.
[26:17.900 --> 26:19.640]  They don't have to answer to anybody, which is great.
[26:19.640 --> 26:23.880]  I, you know, I, I've always thought Steve jobs must've looked at the way they set that
[26:23.880 --> 26:31.640]  up and thought, you know, God damn, I wish I'd done something like that, uh, uh, that
[26:31.640 --> 26:33.120]  they've lost interest.
[26:33.120 --> 26:38.000]  They've lost interest in what Google as we know it is and that they just, they, they
[26:38.000 --> 26:43.000]  want to do other things, you know, to me that for Google, you know, whether the prospects
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.260]  for alphabet are bad, I don't know.
[26:45.260 --> 26:47.400]  Maybe they've got some great new stuff up their sleeve.
[26:47.400 --> 26:50.240]  But for Google, as we know it, I feel like they're going into a decline.
[26:50.240 --> 26:51.240]  Hmm.
[26:51.240 --> 26:52.240]  Yeah.
[26:52.240 --> 26:55.760]  By the way, cause it seems like they're taking, they're taking the stuff that they think is
[26:55.760 --> 26:59.320]  the longterm growth stuff out of Google and other places.
[26:59.320 --> 27:00.320]  Right.
[27:00.320 --> 27:05.040]  And this, and this logo change makes me feel that the people left, left at Google, you
[27:05.040 --> 27:11.640]  know, what is now just Google, uh, really don't, they, they don't get what Google, what
[27:11.640 --> 27:14.440]  made Google great.
[27:14.440 --> 27:15.440]  They don't get it.
[27:15.440 --> 27:19.800]  I think cause to me, this brand doesn't fit what the best of Google feels like
[27:19.800 --> 27:27.240]  I mean, I was thinking, well, I was thinking that it was, that it was more dictated by
[27:27.240 --> 27:32.040]  alphabet maybe rather than done with internally to Google.
[27:32.040 --> 27:37.240]  But I mean, maybe they, maybe they said to go out and design a new logo or, or maybe
[27:37.240 --> 27:45.040]  they said we have to make sure that the alphabet brand is all consistent and we're going in
[27:45.040 --> 27:46.040]  a different direction.
[27:46.040 --> 27:47.040]  Yeah.
[27:47.040 --> 27:48.040]  Maybe.
[27:48.040 --> 27:49.040]  I don't know.
[27:49.040 --> 27:54.400]  I think they've lost something that was pretty good and replaced it with something that's
[27:54.400 --> 27:55.400]  terrible.
[27:55.400 --> 27:56.400]  Yeah.
[27:56.400 --> 27:57.400]  Anyway.
[27:57.400 --> 27:59.400]  That's my thoughts on their logo.
[27:59.400 --> 28:00.400]  Okay.
[28:00.400 --> 28:08.040]  I mean, I wouldn't go, I would not say that they have no taste, but I don't think their
[28:08.040 --> 28:12.880]  taste is as good as they, there are people in the, in teams within the company with great
[28:12.880 --> 28:17.320]  taste institutionally, the company has no taste.
[28:17.320 --> 28:18.320]  That's my argument.
[28:18.320 --> 28:20.480]  It's a, it's a very strong argument.
[28:20.480 --> 28:26.280]  Anyway, let's take a break and I'll tell you about a very good friend of the show, Harry's.
[28:26.280 --> 28:33.320]  You guys know Harry's, they sell high quality razors, blades, and other, you know, shaving
[28:33.320 --> 28:36.960]  lotions and creams and shaving stuff.
[28:36.960 --> 28:41.400]  And they sell it for a fraction of the price of the big brands.
[28:41.400 --> 28:46.000]  They were started by two guys who just wanted to make a better product and figured there
[28:46.000 --> 28:52.440]  had to be a way to sell shaving stuff, especially blades cheaper than what the big blade companies
[28:52.440 --> 28:54.680]  sell stuff for.
[28:54.680 --> 28:59.420]  So they started ordering blades from their own factory in Germany.
[28:59.420 --> 29:00.420]  They liked the blade so much.
[29:00.420 --> 29:01.420]  They just bought the factory.
[29:01.420 --> 29:02.840]  It must be nice.
[29:02.840 --> 29:04.840]  So they just own their own blade factory.
[29:04.840 --> 29:10.960]  They make their own blades in Germany place that's been making blades for a long time.
[29:10.960 --> 29:13.340]  And then they ship them right to you.
[29:13.340 --> 29:14.420]  So there is no middleman.
[29:14.420 --> 29:16.740]  That's how they have the prices so much lower.
[29:16.740 --> 29:18.560]  So you know, you buy like Gillette.
[29:18.560 --> 29:23.720]  It's you know, going to warehouses and middlemen and distributors, and then it ends up in a
[29:23.720 --> 29:28.400]  retail store and every step of the way it all gets marked up.
[29:28.400 --> 29:33.400]  Their starter set, it's an amazing deal, 15 bucks, you get a razor, that's the handle,
[29:33.400 --> 29:37.720]  you get moisturizing shave cream or gel, your preference, whether you want a cream or gel
[29:37.720 --> 29:43.320]  and three razor blades, 15 bucks, and when you need more blades, depending on how many
[29:43.320 --> 29:45.700]  you buy them at, they're always two bucks or each less.
[29:45.700 --> 29:49.320]  So like an eight pack, which is like a small one, it's just 15 bucks, but you can get a
[29:49.320 --> 29:52.560]  16 pack, 25 bucks.
[29:52.560 --> 29:55.800]  Way way better.
[29:55.800 --> 30:01.320]  I think on Amazon, the last time I checked here, it says a 12 pack of fusions from Gillette,
[30:01.320 --> 30:02.320]  which is very comparable.
[30:02.320 --> 30:06.520]  I think it's actually the blade I used to use before I switched to Harry's.
[30:06.520 --> 30:09.380]  They have a 12 pack for 41 bucks.
[30:09.380 --> 30:12.520]  So that's Amazon, who you know is not getting undercut on price.
[30:12.520 --> 30:13.560]  So way more.
[30:13.560 --> 30:18.600]  It's like three bucks a blade, more than three bucks a blade for Gillette's, less than two
[30:18.600 --> 30:22.160]  bucks a blade for Harry's.
[30:22.160 --> 30:25.800]  So if you're just looking to save money, Harry's is the way to go.
[30:25.800 --> 30:29.380]  If you care about design, Harry's is also the way to go.
[30:29.380 --> 30:30.720]  Really nice packaging.
[30:30.720 --> 30:34.320]  I've always said this, their packaging is so nice, it makes me not want to throw it
[30:34.320 --> 30:38.560]  away and then I realized that that's just the crazy hoarder.
[30:38.560 --> 30:43.000]  But I know exactly, I mean I have Harry's and stuff from that, I didn't know exactly
[30:43.000 --> 30:44.000]  what you mean.
[30:44.000 --> 30:45.440]  It's really well done.
[30:45.440 --> 30:53.600]  As I stare to my left in my office here and look at the stack of old Apple laptops, I've
[30:53.600 --> 30:58.100]  got like eight old PowerBooks, I've got iBooks, they're all stacked up.
[30:58.100 --> 30:59.400]  That's what I feel like when I get Harry's.
[30:59.400 --> 31:02.580]  I almost curse them for the quality of their packaging.
[31:02.580 --> 31:05.120]  So if you care about design, Harry's is the way to go.
[31:05.120 --> 31:10.480]  If you care about just being cheap, Harry's is the way to go.
[31:10.480 --> 31:15.200]  If you care about quality shave, so you're not like cutting yourself up and making a
[31:15.200 --> 31:17.060]  mess of your face, Harry's is the way to go.
[31:17.060 --> 31:20.000]  Their blades are super sharp, really great.
[31:20.000 --> 31:22.920]  And if you care about just being lazy, it's the way to go because you don't even have
[31:22.920 --> 31:23.920]  to leave your house.
[31:23.920 --> 31:28.680]  They just show up and if you want to, you can even tell them how often you need to replace
[31:28.680 --> 31:33.020]  your blades and just subscribe and they'll just send them to you on a regular basis.
[31:33.020 --> 31:36.680]  So you lose, you win, I mean, every way.
[31:36.680 --> 31:41.280]  So go there to harrys.com, H-A-R-R-Y-S.com.
[31:41.280 --> 31:45.040]  And if it's your first purchase, use this code, talk show, they don't have the the,
[31:45.040 --> 31:48.360]  it's just talk show and you'll save five bucks off your first purchase.
[31:48.360 --> 31:52.680]  So that $15 kit I was telling you about is only 10 bucks, so it's practically free.
[31:52.680 --> 31:59.080]  So go there and check them out at harrys.com and remember the code talk show.
[31:59.080 --> 32:00.080]  My notes here are confusing.
[32:00.080 --> 32:01.080]  I don't know.
[32:01.080 --> 32:04.080]  And then down below here it says promo code, the talk show.
[32:04.080 --> 32:06.400]  So I don't even know what the hell the code is.
[32:06.400 --> 32:07.400]  Try them both.
[32:07.400 --> 32:09.600]  And one of them, one of them will give you, right?
[32:09.600 --> 32:15.800]  If you don't get money off, try again, it's actually a fun, and then try, and then try
[32:15.800 --> 32:17.800]  Gruber.
[32:17.800 --> 32:20.600]  Yeah.
[32:20.600 --> 32:21.600]  What else is going on?
[32:21.600 --> 32:22.920]  So we got this Google logo thing out of the way.
[32:22.920 --> 32:25.720]  I guess we'll talk to, let's talk about the event because that may be the, well, do you
[32:25.720 --> 32:26.720]  want to do that?
[32:26.720 --> 32:27.720]  Or you want to talk about it with speaker?
[32:27.720 --> 32:31.120]  And no taste, we could talk about the Samsung watch.
[32:31.120 --> 32:32.120]  Oh, that's a good one.
[32:32.120 --> 32:33.120]  Yeah.
[32:33.120 --> 32:34.120]  We can talk about that.
[32:34.120 --> 32:35.120]  Yeah.
[32:35.120 --> 32:37.280]  Which I actually think, I actually think looks really nice.
[32:37.280 --> 32:44.200]  But I wrote a piece about the difference between square watch faces and round watch faces.
[32:44.200 --> 32:50.880]  And I kind of think that square watch faces are actually more the way of the future than
[32:50.880 --> 32:51.880]  round watch faces.
[32:51.880 --> 32:54.000]  Oh, there I got the article.
[32:54.000 --> 32:55.480]  I did not even know you wrote this piece.
[32:55.480 --> 32:56.480]  This is nice.
[32:56.480 --> 32:57.480]  Yeah.
[32:57.480 --> 32:58.480]  Yeah.
[32:58.480 --> 32:59.480]  I'm going to link that up.
[32:59.480 --> 33:00.480]  All right.
[33:00.480 --> 33:01.480]  So tell me, why do you think that?
[33:01.480 --> 33:06.480]  Well, and again, you had the guy who's not a designer on.
[33:06.480 --> 33:11.880]  But from the things that I've read from people who are actually designers, it's certainly
[33:11.880 --> 33:19.440]  easier to code for a square face and get, but also a square face is better at representing
[33:19.440 --> 33:20.440]  most information.
[33:20.440 --> 33:27.600]  That's not to say that there aren't certain instances where a round depiction of something
[33:27.600 --> 33:30.020]  is not more valuable than a square one.
[33:30.020 --> 33:34.580]  It's just saying that you can, you can easily more easily get a circle into a square than
[33:34.580 --> 33:36.520]  the other way around.
[33:36.520 --> 33:39.360]  You can get a circle into a square without losing any size.
[33:39.360 --> 33:40.360]  Yeah.
[33:40.360 --> 33:42.960]  Whereas you cannot get a square into a circle without losing size.
[33:42.960 --> 33:43.960]  Yeah.
[33:43.960 --> 33:47.520]  That's a, that is exactly what I have thought.
[33:47.520 --> 33:54.200]  Well, would I have been shocked if a year ago, and it would have been exactly a year
[33:54.200 --> 33:59.320]  ago as we talk that if, you know, when they unveiled the Apple watch, if it had been circular,
[33:59.320 --> 34:02.060]  I guess I wouldn't have been shocked.
[34:02.060 --> 34:09.840]  But I wasn't surprised at all that Apple's was rectangular because of that exact thing
[34:09.840 --> 34:18.680]  that it's for generic display that might end up displaying anything including, and I think
[34:18.680 --> 34:30.520]  especially today's Apple post app store and iPhone Apple realizes that the Apple watch
[34:30.520 --> 34:36.560]  was if it's successful, would end up being used in ways that they'd never imagined, right?
[34:36.560 --> 34:44.160]  That's, that's like the big lesson of, of the iPhone to me is, you know, that there
[34:44.160 --> 34:49.880]  was this, uh, you know, this whole internal debate, I think Ben Thompson and I were talking
[34:49.880 --> 34:53.840]  about in the last episode that it's just so funny that there was a camp within the company
[34:53.840 --> 34:57.000]  that was sort of like, we don't need an app store, you know, we'll, we'll just make all
[34:57.000 --> 35:01.640]  the apps we need ourselves and partner with companies, you know, like Google for the YouTube
[35:01.640 --> 35:05.040]  app and the Google maps app that shipped on the first iPhone.
[35:05.040 --> 35:08.600]  We'll just partner with people and we'll, we'll make all the apps that we need for this
[35:08.600 --> 35:09.600]  thing.
[35:09.600 --> 35:14.040]  Um, so like for example, I do think that Apple foresaw that there would have, you know, right
[35:14.040 --> 35:17.720]  away that there would be a second screen of apps, you know, I think that they had the
[35:17.720 --> 35:21.600]  idea that you'd page between, you know, from the left to the right, you know, to get to
[35:21.600 --> 35:22.720]  more apps.
[35:22.720 --> 35:25.960]  I think though that there was a side within the company that though, you know, that'll
[35:25.960 --> 35:30.200]  be there, there'll be our apps, there'll be like 20, 24 apps for the iPhone and it'll
[35:30.200 --> 35:31.200]  be great.
[35:31.200 --> 35:37.320]  Uh, and the, and that so far or Safari was the outlet for it, you know, that I, I actually
[35:37.320 --> 35:41.040]  think that, you know, that when they announced that at the first WWDC that we have a sweet
[35:41.040 --> 35:46.120]  solution for you guys, I think that they meant it, I think there were some people within
[35:46.120 --> 35:49.520]  the company who wanted, you know, definitely worth pushing for the app store angle, you
[35:49.520 --> 35:54.880]  know, who, who, who cringed at that, just like all the developers in the audience watching
[35:54.880 --> 35:56.360]  the keynote did.
[35:56.360 --> 36:00.520]  But I think that some of them thought this, you know, that that's good enough for like,
[36:00.520 --> 36:04.400]  you know, and I think they foresaw things like, you know, like, well, you do your online
[36:04.400 --> 36:05.400]  banking on your phone.
[36:05.400 --> 36:10.360]  Well, you know, they'll just write a website that works, that fits right on the screen.
[36:10.360 --> 36:15.700]  Um, so I think, you know, now lo these many years later and all these literally millions
[36:15.700 --> 36:20.200]  of apps and all the money they're making on the apps, they realize, Hey, the phone is
[36:20.200 --> 36:21.720]  being used in ways we never imagined.
[36:21.720 --> 36:24.840]  I think they knew going into it with a watch that it would be used in ways they didn't
[36:24.840 --> 36:25.840]  imagine.
[36:25.840 --> 36:30.080]  And I think a rectangle is a better generic shape than a circle for that.
[36:30.080 --> 36:31.080]  Yeah.
[36:31.080 --> 36:34.840]  And, and the thing, one of the things that struck me, even just like while I was writing
[36:34.840 --> 36:38.920]  this piece was that, cause I went back and looked at all the old watches that I had lying
[36:38.920 --> 36:46.000]  around and, and I guess that came out when, because I was using a circular watch face
[36:46.000 --> 36:51.560]  and I switched to modular, which I like and don't like, but I like it because it's got
[36:51.560 --> 36:54.240]  a lot of extra information on it.
[36:54.240 --> 36:59.160]  And the problem that I had was like, I wanted a watch face with a date on it.
[36:59.160 --> 37:04.260]  And I also wanted a watch face that I could get the most complications on.
[37:04.260 --> 37:08.960]  And the way you do that in most of them is by putting the date inside the watch face.
[37:08.960 --> 37:09.960]  Yeah.
[37:09.960 --> 37:15.640]  Well, most of those are too small for me to read because I'm too old for it now.
[37:15.640 --> 37:22.440]  And the other thing is that five minutes out of every hour, you can't read the date anyway
[37:22.440 --> 37:24.720]  because the hand, the minute hand is covering it.
[37:24.720 --> 37:25.720]  Yeah.
[37:25.720 --> 37:26.720]  I've thought the same thing.
[37:26.720 --> 37:27.720]  Yeah.
[37:27.720 --> 37:32.920]  And that's sort of like, it was interesting how I went back and looked at those old watches
[37:32.920 --> 37:36.500]  and thought, yeah, I mean, that's kind of a thing that I've struggled with for years
[37:36.500 --> 37:42.320]  really and never really thought much about, but I mean, you can with a watch with physical
[37:42.320 --> 37:45.000]  hands, the minute hand is always the one that's higher.
[37:45.000 --> 37:52.040]  So you can kind of tilt to see around it in order to see what the date is.
[37:52.040 --> 37:56.760]  But it's even worse on like a chronograph because it's got all those extra things on
[37:56.760 --> 38:03.080]  there that are on the face, but they get covered up at odd parts of the, you know, parts of
[38:03.080 --> 38:06.200]  the hour and become difficult to use.
[38:06.200 --> 38:10.080]  So all that stuff is just adding information to a watch with a circular face and trying
[38:10.080 --> 38:12.600]  to put it inside that circle becomes really difficult.
[38:12.600 --> 38:13.600]  Yeah.
[38:13.600 --> 38:18.800]  And the modular face, while I don't like certain things about it, it just displays all the
[38:18.800 --> 38:20.300]  information.
[38:20.300 --> 38:27.640]  And there is like a psychological angle to it too, like the way that everybody, you know,
[38:27.640 --> 38:32.040]  the famous, the adage that, you know, if you drop a slice of butter toast, it's always
[38:32.040 --> 38:33.760]  going to land butter side down.
[38:33.760 --> 38:36.680]  It's because that's what you remember is the time that it did that.
[38:36.680 --> 38:42.080]  It just seems like it's more than more often than not when I want to check the date it's
[38:42.080 --> 38:45.520]  quarter after it just seems like, Oh my God, it's wow.
[38:45.520 --> 38:49.760]  How come every time I want to check the date it's quarter after and I can't see the day,
[38:49.760 --> 38:51.160]  what the hell?
[38:51.160 --> 38:52.520]  And that's not true.
[38:52.520 --> 38:56.280]  It's just that all the other times I checked the date, I don't remember that, but the times
[38:56.280 --> 38:58.060]  that it is blocked, I remember.
[38:58.060 --> 39:01.760]  And then it's, it just feels like it's always quarter after.
[39:01.760 --> 39:02.760]  Right.
[39:02.760 --> 39:03.760]  Right.
[39:03.760 --> 39:06.700]  Just like when you play blackjack, it seems like I always get 16.
[39:06.700 --> 39:07.940]  That's all I remember.
[39:07.940 --> 39:08.940]  Every goddamn hand.
[39:08.940 --> 39:10.240]  You only ever get 16.
[39:10.240 --> 39:14.780]  All I ever get are 16s and the dealer gets a blackjack every goddamn time.
[39:14.780 --> 39:15.780]  Every time.
[39:15.780 --> 39:16.780]  How is that possible?
[39:16.780 --> 39:17.780]  It's unreal.
[39:17.780 --> 39:18.780]  Yeah.
[39:18.780 --> 39:19.780]  That's true.
[39:19.780 --> 39:23.920]  And I think that too, it also, it stinks, it doesn't stink.
[39:23.920 --> 39:29.280]  It sticks out with the Apple watch even more because when it happens, you realize that
[39:29.280 --> 39:33.400]  you have the option of changing to a different face that it fixes it.
[39:33.400 --> 39:37.720]  You know, like if you buy an analog watch and the date gets covered up on its quarter
[39:37.720 --> 39:42.260]  after you might be annoyed, but you don't think, well, I could spend 10 seconds here
[39:42.260 --> 39:45.160]  and change the lot face and, and fix this problem.
[39:45.160 --> 39:46.160]  Right.
[39:46.160 --> 39:49.520]  Because with the Apple watch, you, you know, it's always an option to switch to a different
[39:49.520 --> 39:51.440]  face where you don't have that problem.
[39:51.440 --> 39:52.440]  Yeah.
[39:52.440 --> 39:59.840]  And so that Samsung watch, the Galaxy, the gear S two is a very nice looking circular
[39:59.840 --> 40:03.720]  faced smartwatch.
[40:03.720 --> 40:07.920]  But I feel, I still feel like the circular face is the wrong UI.
[40:07.920 --> 40:09.400]  Yeah.
[40:09.400 --> 40:16.040]  I think it's a design, but maybe not catastrophically, you know, like maybe
[40:16.040 --> 40:20.600]  that's not necessarily going to limit the success of those watches.
[40:20.600 --> 40:26.880]  But I do think, you know, I, there, and there are some people that this is a funny little
[40:26.880 --> 40:30.440]  side topic, this square versus round thing.
[40:30.440 --> 40:34.720]  There's a fair number of people who I've seen, you know, either an email or on Twitter you
[40:34.720 --> 40:39.340]  know, communicating with me that, that are predicting that Apple will eventually go circular
[40:39.340 --> 40:41.880]  because circular, you know, circular watches look better.
[40:41.880 --> 40:46.480]  People who look at the Apple watch and say, I just don't like, it looks like a, you know,
[40:46.480 --> 40:47.480]  it looks too nerdy to me.
[40:47.480 --> 40:51.360]  Cause it's square Apple's got, you know, they're going to go circular eventually.
[40:51.360 --> 40:53.080]  And I don't think that's going to happen.
[40:53.080 --> 40:56.440]  I don't think that's going to happen either, but I think it would be.
[40:56.440 --> 41:00.400]  And I think that way too hard now, of course, Apple changes things all the time and they're
[41:00.400 --> 41:04.200]  never really all that worried about making developers do more work.
[41:04.200 --> 41:07.160]  I mean, they're not, and they shouldn't be, you know, if they were, they, it would actually
[41:07.160 --> 41:08.160]  slow them down.
[41:08.160 --> 41:12.360]  And in the long run, in the short run, it's always, it's never good that if you're making,
[41:12.360 --> 41:17.880]  if they make changes that make developers do more work like the the big change in Iowa
[41:17.880 --> 41:21.820]  seven, where the, you know, pretty much every single app other than games had to redo their
[41:21.820 --> 41:24.920]  entire user interface or else they would look bad.
[41:24.920 --> 41:31.000]  That's, you know, it's a lot to ask every day, all of you with all of your apps have
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.600]  to redo all of entirety of your user interface.
[41:33.600 --> 41:38.120]  That's a lot to ask, but it's the right move going forward rather than stick with something
[41:38.120 --> 41:40.280]  that's going to be outdated.
[41:40.280 --> 41:46.560]  Still waiting for a new icon from Instagram, they redid the interface, right?
[41:46.560 --> 41:53.580]  I really wonder, I wonder, I would love to hear what, what the argument inside the company
[41:53.580 --> 41:54.580]  is on that.
[41:54.580 --> 41:59.460]  Cause it, their icon does really just being dicks at this point.
[41:59.460 --> 42:06.060]  And it's not hard to imagine just, and I know flat is a overused term, but just flatten
[42:06.060 --> 42:08.320]  the goddamn thing, you know, right, right, right.
[42:08.320 --> 42:09.800]  It could be the same colors.
[42:09.800 --> 42:10.800]  Yeah.
[42:10.800 --> 42:11.800]  Same colors.
[42:11.800 --> 42:15.520]  I think it would move the drop shadow, right?
[42:15.520 --> 42:18.360]  Just deforest all it.
[42:18.360 --> 42:24.920]  Yeah, I, I do think the new set, the, the, the new Samsung, I'm going to get it wrong.
[42:24.920 --> 42:27.240]  I on Twitter that I called it the G two.
[42:27.240 --> 42:28.240]  It's not the G two.
[42:28.240 --> 42:29.240]  It's the S two gear.
[42:29.240 --> 42:30.240]  S two, two.
[42:30.240 --> 42:33.160]  I'm just going to call it the Samsung, which is not a great name.
[42:33.160 --> 42:37.440]  I actually, here's a case where I wish that they just cap copied Apple and just called
[42:37.440 --> 42:43.800]  it Samsung watch because that's, but then I could remember the name, but anyway, it,
[42:43.800 --> 42:47.760]  it, it, you know, I, and I was, you know, pretty complimentary to it when I linked to
[42:47.760 --> 42:48.760]  it.
[42:48.760 --> 42:52.520]  I, you know, and people who, I saw people, a few people said, I'm surprised, I was surprised
[42:52.520 --> 42:54.760]  to see you be complimentary to it.
[42:54.760 --> 42:59.480]  And to me that it's like, I'm never trying to be against Samsung or against Google.
[42:59.480 --> 43:03.320]  I'm saying what I really think and what I really think about most Samsung products is
[43:03.320 --> 43:08.040]  that they, they're, you know, derivative crap.
[43:08.040 --> 43:11.400]  So therefore it seems as though I'm against Samsung because I keep saying it, but it's
[43:11.400 --> 43:13.880]  because they keep putting out what I see as derivative crap.
[43:13.880 --> 43:17.520]  And then they put out something that to me is interesting and original and looks pretty
[43:17.520 --> 43:18.520]  good.
[43:18.520 --> 43:21.800]  And so I said, you know, it's interesting and original, it looks pretty good.
[43:21.800 --> 43:24.240]  They did copy a few things from the Apple watch, right?
[43:24.240 --> 43:25.240]  That, that round.
[43:25.240 --> 43:31.960]  I mean, it's with their system though, it's apps instead of, uh, contacts, right?
[43:31.960 --> 43:32.960]  Yeah.
[43:32.960 --> 43:33.960]  Yeah.
[43:33.960 --> 43:36.640]  It looks like, it looks like the context thing that, that comes up when you hit the button
[43:36.640 --> 43:39.320]  on the side of the Apple watch, except it's actually apps.
[43:39.320 --> 43:40.320]  Yeah.
[43:40.320 --> 43:44.240]  Uh, and the other thing is, did you see the interface?
[43:44.240 --> 43:47.440]  I couldn't find a better place to link to it, but there's just a couple of seconds of
[43:47.440 --> 43:52.200]  it in the verges video where they show what it, when you, when you, they don't call them
[43:52.200 --> 43:53.200]  complications.
[43:53.200 --> 43:54.200]  I forget what they call them.
[43:54.200 --> 43:58.360]  They come up with a new word for complications, but whatever they call the complications on
[43:58.360 --> 44:04.380]  their watch faces that are user adjustable, when you go into the edit mode, it is exactly
[44:04.380 --> 44:06.380]  like Apple watch.
[44:06.380 --> 44:11.520]  Like there's a little, there's, there's dots at the top that you can swipe between which
[44:11.520 --> 44:12.920]  thing you're editing.
[44:12.920 --> 44:19.040]  When you're like changing the, uh, like the color of the second hand, it highlights in
[44:19.040 --> 44:25.120]  the same color and there's even, they even like use like the same all caps in a round
[44:25.120 --> 44:28.240]  wreck thing that says like color it.
[44:28.240 --> 44:32.500]  If you look for it, it is, it's just exactly they like, they're, they, it could not be
[44:32.500 --> 44:36.800]  more of a copy, um, kind of embarrassing for them, but yeah.
[44:36.800 --> 44:41.320]  But in terms of outward appearance, for the most part, it does not look like anything
[44:41.320 --> 44:42.320]  like it.
[44:42.320 --> 44:46.560]  And, and that, that the, what do they call it?
[44:46.560 --> 44:47.560]  The bezel.
[44:47.560 --> 44:48.560]  The bezel.
[44:48.560 --> 44:53.880]  So getting bezel as an, you know, a thing that changes the interface is a really good
[44:53.880 --> 44:54.880]  idea.
[44:54.880 --> 44:55.880]  Yeah.
[44:55.880 --> 44:56.880]  It seems like it.
[44:56.880 --> 44:58.880]  And, and by all reports from people who've had a hands on with it, it has a good feel
[44:58.880 --> 45:00.520]  to it, which is important.
[45:00.520 --> 45:02.080]  It's, you know, it's funny.
[45:02.080 --> 45:06.840]  It's, it's, it's actually like talking about this is exactly why I like having a podcast
[45:06.840 --> 45:12.880]  and cause I almost feel like even if I had gone really long writing about it, it would
[45:12.880 --> 45:17.320]  be so much easier just to talk about it, which is that I want to say, I wanted to say, look,
[45:17.320 --> 45:23.720]  they copied a few little things, but overall it's, you know, it's, it's mostly an original
[45:23.720 --> 45:26.880]  design and kudos and a good one and kudos to them for that.
[45:26.880 --> 45:30.560]  But I didn't want to mention the little things that they'd copied because then people would
[45:30.560 --> 45:33.040]  say, you know, how can you call this a copy?
[45:33.040 --> 45:34.040]  Right.
[45:34.040 --> 45:35.960]  That the, you know, it's round instead of square.
[45:35.960 --> 45:39.440]  How can you say it's a, it's a ripoff and I'm, you know, I'm not saying that, I'm just
[45:39.440 --> 45:42.520]  saying they did steal a few things, but everybody does that.
[45:42.520 --> 45:45.560]  I, so like, I don't even think it's worth complaining about in the way that like Apple
[45:45.560 --> 45:50.120]  will steal things, you know, like command tab, which was a windows, you know, invention.
[45:50.120 --> 45:54.080]  So taking little good ideas from the other guys is okay.
[45:54.080 --> 45:59.680]  It's it's the, you know, when you wholesale copy deal type of thing, right?
[45:59.680 --> 46:03.160]  When you get Phil Schiller on the stand in a court case and the, and they hold up a thing
[46:03.160 --> 46:07.080]  and he says, I can't tell if they can't tell, can't tell the difference if that's ours or
[46:07.080 --> 46:08.080]  is.
[46:08.080 --> 46:11.680]  And it's like, you don't have, well, you can tell the difference, but one of the, one of
[46:11.680 --> 46:16.920]  the other things I liked about it was that it, it kind of more so than any of the other,
[46:16.920 --> 46:19.760]  any of the Android wear watches.
[46:19.760 --> 46:25.760]  And then I know this one's based on Tizen, but that it has a good sense of what it is.
[46:25.760 --> 46:26.760]  There's like two of them.
[46:26.760 --> 46:28.000]  There's like two levels, right?
[46:28.000 --> 46:32.820]  And one of them looks like to me like a swatch, which is not a cut down.
[46:32.820 --> 46:37.640]  And the other one looks like a good, like $80 or 90, a hundred, something like that
[46:37.640 --> 46:40.160]  sort of a mid range watch.
[46:40.160 --> 46:42.920]  And I'm sure they're probably cost more because they have, they have more features, they should
[46:42.920 --> 46:43.920]  cost more.
[46:43.920 --> 46:48.080]  Uh, and it's, but we don't still don't know how much they're going to cost, but they didn't
[46:48.080 --> 46:53.500]  like the, to me, the, the motor roll just looks flat out terrible.
[46:53.500 --> 46:58.120]  The three motor roll 360 just looks terrible because it's just a cylinder cutoff with like
[46:58.120 --> 47:01.760]  little prongs on the end to attach a band to.
[47:01.760 --> 47:08.400]  And then the other one that's a big Android wear watches, the horribly named LG one, the
[47:08.400 --> 47:16.240]  oh yeah, watcher bane, um, which looks like it's trying to be a fancy watch, but it looks
[47:16.240 --> 47:18.080]  like it's made out of cheap materials.
[47:18.080 --> 47:23.280]  Is that the one that has numbers printed around the bezel, like hardware printed around the
[47:23.280 --> 47:24.280]  bezel?
[47:24.280 --> 47:25.280]  I don't think so.
[47:25.280 --> 47:26.360]  No, no.
[47:26.360 --> 47:32.780]  There's one that has like a third, like 15, 30, 45 around the outside, which is really
[47:32.780 --> 47:33.780]  weird on it.
[47:33.780 --> 47:35.920]  That is very strange on a smartwatch.
[47:35.920 --> 47:36.920]  Yeah.
[47:36.920 --> 47:40.720]  Like it's, I know why it's there because you're using it to tell time most of the time, but
[47:40.720 --> 47:44.400]  it just seems like a weird, it just seems weird that it's printed on the hardware instead
[47:44.400 --> 47:45.960]  of doing it on the screen.
[47:45.960 --> 47:49.840]  But that's the one that people, the LG one is the one that people most point to and say,
[47:49.840 --> 47:54.720]  or had up to date pointed to and said, that looks like a real watch.
[47:54.720 --> 47:55.720]  Yeah.
[47:55.720 --> 48:02.180]  Um, which I mean, you know, there, there happened square watches before and also it looks like
[48:02.180 --> 48:03.760]  a real crappy watch to me.
[48:03.760 --> 48:04.760]  Yeah.
[48:04.760 --> 48:08.880]  The LG one looks like a good, like maybe, you know, somewhat more casual, not super
[48:08.880 --> 48:10.840]  fancy, but like a good watch.
[48:10.840 --> 48:11.840]  Yeah.
[48:11.840 --> 48:17.200]  It's, it's funny cause I feel like in my experience you really do have to see any watch in person
[48:17.200 --> 48:19.300]  to truly get a sense of the size.
[48:19.300 --> 48:23.840]  Like seeing a photograph of it on somebody's wrist just doesn't really work.
[48:23.840 --> 48:29.760]  Although if it's, if it's a huge enough, like the original Moto 270, you can tell just by
[48:29.760 --> 48:31.380]  looking at the picture that it's humongous.
[48:31.380 --> 48:34.000]  But then when you look at it in real life, you're like, Oh my God, it's even bigger than
[48:34.000 --> 48:35.240]  I thought.
[48:35.240 --> 48:41.760]  Um, but that said, the numbers of the, I think the Samsung, there's two sizes, 40 and 42.
[48:41.760 --> 48:47.520]  Um, and 40, 40 millimeters is really a standard size for a watch today.
[48:47.520 --> 48:52.120]  Like the old standard for men's watches older, you know, like going back decades was more
[48:52.120 --> 48:54.080]  like 36 millimeters.
[48:54.080 --> 48:56.840]  Um, but 40 is pretty standard.
[48:56.840 --> 49:02.520]  Um, and you know, obviously comparable roughly to Apple's 42.
[49:02.520 --> 49:07.760]  Um, it is interesting to me that even a year later and even Samsung can't yet match Apple
[49:07.760 --> 49:08.760]  on the 38.
[49:08.760 --> 49:13.200]  Um, cause I do think, I do think one of the problems with the Samsung one, so I think
[49:13.200 --> 49:17.920]  the Samsung with totally credible just as like a piece of jewelry on a man's wrist.
[49:17.920 --> 49:23.800]  Uh, and to me it's the first, first one that's not the Apple watch that, that qualifies for
[49:23.800 --> 49:24.800]  that.
[49:24.800 --> 49:25.800]  Really.
[49:25.800 --> 49:27.200]  I don't, I, even the LG one, I don't really think looks that good.
[49:27.200 --> 49:31.200]  I don't, um, uh,
[49:31.200 --> 49:34.600]  I still don't think though that the Samsung one, even the smaller one, I don't think it's
[49:34.600 --> 49:38.480]  going to be, uh, something that women would wear.
[49:38.480 --> 49:40.560]  I just don't think it, I don't think it's small enough yet.
[49:40.560 --> 49:45.020]  And I think Samsung kind of knows it because I don't think any of the bands that they've
[49:45.020 --> 49:50.280]  done look like they're targeted at women.
[49:50.280 --> 49:51.680]  That's not to say no women will buy it.
[49:51.680 --> 49:55.680]  I mean, and watches are a funny thing where there's an awful lot of like different styles.
[49:55.680 --> 49:59.160]  Yeah, I've seen lots of women wear like big chunky watches.
[49:59.160 --> 50:01.280]  Well, and look at the Apple watch.
[50:01.280 --> 50:05.280]  There's an awful lot of the, you know, especially the most popular ones, like the sport, the
[50:05.280 --> 50:09.960]  sport ones are, you know, unisex, you know, I think, you know, you could argue that the
[50:09.960 --> 50:15.640]  pink band is, you know, probably, you know, more feminine.
[50:15.640 --> 50:21.080]  Um, but I would say other than the pink, all of the other colors, even the black are, are
[50:21.080 --> 50:22.080]  unisex.
[50:22.080 --> 50:27.440]  You know, I, I wouldn't say that, you know, that there's really any kind of gender towards
[50:27.440 --> 50:28.440]  that.
[50:28.440 --> 50:34.720]  I mean, I think the, the link bracelet is probably, you know, to me looks masculine.
[50:34.720 --> 50:39.320]  But most of the other ones I think are unisex, but I think Samsung's with the, like the leather
[50:39.320 --> 50:40.320]  and stuff like that.
[50:40.320 --> 50:44.040]  I, I think they look like men's watches just in general.
[50:44.040 --> 50:45.040]  Yeah.
[50:45.040 --> 50:46.040]  Yeah.
[50:46.040 --> 50:51.200]  I mean, I would say, I would say that a man would be more likely to like it than, than
[50:51.200 --> 50:57.800]  a woman, which is not, you know, not to make a flat out blanket statement.
[50:57.800 --> 51:01.780]  So an interesting thing that I was not aware of, somebody on Twitter pointed out to me
[51:01.780 --> 51:07.920]  that, that the fact that they're using Tizen instead of Android Wear, um, opens up China
[51:07.920 --> 51:08.920]  to them.
[51:08.920 --> 51:13.280]  And that Android Wear apparently is not, there's no, Android Wear watches aren't available
[51:13.280 --> 51:14.280]  in China.
[51:14.280 --> 51:16.200]  And I could be wrong here.
[51:16.200 --> 51:21.380]  Just going from a guy on Twitter and I asked him to clarify and he said that, um, I did
[51:21.380 --> 51:25.800]  know that this was true that, you know how like with Android, Android, uh, you know,
[51:25.800 --> 51:31.320]  Samsung takes Android from Google and you know, if they agree to such and such, they
[51:31.320 --> 51:35.440]  can have these Google apps built in, but they still get to customize the interface with,
[51:35.440 --> 51:37.440]  you know, what do they call it?
[51:37.440 --> 51:38.440]  TouchWiz.
[51:38.440 --> 51:41.880]  Um, you know, and they can add their own apps and stuff.
[51:41.880 --> 51:43.920]  Android Wear, there is no option to do that.
[51:43.920 --> 51:47.760]  Like Android Wear, you get Android Wear and you do, I think you can like, you can add
[51:47.760 --> 51:50.160]  custom faces, but that's about it.
[51:50.160 --> 51:53.160]  Like you can't disentangle your own apps in there.
[51:53.160 --> 51:54.160]  Yeah.
[51:54.160 --> 51:59.720]  And that's a problem in China because in China, uh, I guess all the Android phones are all,
[51:59.720 --> 52:03.360]  you know, instead of having Google search and stuff like that, they've all got the Chinese
[52:03.360 --> 52:04.360]  equivalents.
[52:04.360 --> 52:06.160]  Um, right.
[52:06.160 --> 52:12.560]  Uh, so that's interesting because I've heard China is a big market.
[52:12.560 --> 52:15.800]  Now the Allen, the Apple watch is definitely on sale in China.
[52:15.800 --> 52:16.800]  Yeah.
[52:16.800 --> 52:22.400]  Well, but that's somehow, you know, uh, you know, that's just Apple being Apple.
[52:22.400 --> 52:23.400]  Yeah.
[52:23.400 --> 52:24.400]  Right.
[52:24.400 --> 52:25.400]  Right.
[52:25.400 --> 52:28.280]  I think that, I guess, I don't even know, it got me thinking about it.
[52:28.280 --> 52:34.560]  Like does, if you're in China with an iPhone, I guess that the app store has different apps.
[52:34.560 --> 52:36.680]  I mean, I don't even know how that, how, how that works.
[52:36.680 --> 52:40.160]  I've never really thought about that, but with the way that China, you know, has the,
[52:40.160 --> 52:45.080]  the great firewall for internet access, uh, how does the app store work in China?
[52:45.080 --> 52:48.560]  I actually, I should probably do some research on this.
[52:48.560 --> 52:49.560]  Yeah.
[52:49.560 --> 52:50.560]  Yeah.
[52:50.560 --> 52:52.360]  We should probably all brush up on how things work in China.
[52:52.360 --> 52:53.360]  Yeah.
[52:53.360 --> 52:54.360]  If anybody out there knows.
[52:54.360 --> 52:55.360]  We should have done that five years ago.
[52:55.360 --> 52:57.920]  If anybody out there knows, send me an email and explain this to me.
[52:57.920 --> 53:04.320]  I would love to hear about it, but it seems very confusing to me.
[53:04.320 --> 53:08.160]  But anyway, yeah, I'm, I'm, you know, interested by your article, but I do think Samsung did
[53:08.160 --> 53:10.680]  a good job with the desk too.
[53:10.680 --> 53:11.680]  Yeah.
[53:11.680 --> 53:12.680]  Yeah.
[53:12.680 --> 53:16.820]  Um, the other thing I got me thinking about too, and I've mentioned this on Daring Fireball,
[53:16.820 --> 53:21.200]  but the watch, and this kind of leads into the next topic, which is next week and what
[53:21.200 --> 53:24.960]  we expect, but, and you know, talking about Apple TV.
[53:24.960 --> 53:31.040]  Um, but the thing that's so weird about this smartwatches is the way that they're all,
[53:31.040 --> 53:35.160]  um, and I think eventually they'll, they'll be independent and they'll just have their
[53:35.160 --> 53:36.580]  own internet access.
[53:36.580 --> 53:42.160]  But the way that everybody's, whether it's apples or androids or Tizen, uh, is tied to
[53:42.160 --> 53:47.600]  the phone, a phone that it's paired with to get it's, you know, most of its information
[53:47.600 --> 53:51.640]  and apps and stuff like that, um, that people don't really have a choice here.
[53:51.640 --> 53:54.220]  Like if it's really, do you want to get a smartwatch or not?
[53:54.220 --> 53:57.440]  And if you do, you know, you're on one side of the fence.
[53:57.440 --> 54:00.760]  You're only going to get, you can only use an Apple watch if you're, if your phone is
[54:00.760 --> 54:02.760]  an iPhone.
[54:02.760 --> 54:08.280]  And you know, and I guess you can use, you can use an Android wear now on, on the, on
[54:08.280 --> 54:10.960]  the iPhone, but you're, it's very, very unlikely.
[54:10.960 --> 54:16.680]  I mean, that's, it's, yes, who, I just can't imagine how many people would do that.
[54:16.680 --> 54:17.680]  Right.
[54:17.680 --> 54:18.680]  It's very unlikely.
[54:18.680 --> 54:19.680]  Yeah.
[54:19.680 --> 54:22.560]  Um, and supposedly I guess the Samsung was quoted recently as saying that they're, they're
[54:22.560 --> 54:27.400]  going to try and bring it, the Tizen watch to the iPhone as well.
[54:27.400 --> 54:28.400]  Why bother?
[54:28.400 --> 54:29.400]  I honestly, I don't know.
[54:29.400 --> 54:30.400]  I would like to try one.
[54:30.400 --> 54:31.400]  I guess it's true.
[54:31.400 --> 54:35.720]  I would be interested in trying it, depending on how much it costs, but I've, I might pick
[54:35.720 --> 54:37.280]  up the low end one and give it a try.
[54:37.280 --> 54:38.280]  Yeah, I would do that.
[54:38.280 --> 54:40.880]  But that's just me being stupid.
[54:40.880 --> 54:42.560]  I mean, I shouldn't even call it stupid.
[54:42.560 --> 54:45.360]  I could totally justify it as a business expense that I might write about.
[54:45.360 --> 54:49.800]  Same reason that I bought the pebble, you know, I paid for both generations of pebble
[54:49.800 --> 54:54.400]  just so I could speak about them intelligently, knowing going in that it was almost certain
[54:54.400 --> 54:57.280]  that I wasn't going to actually wear it regularly.
[54:57.280 --> 54:58.280]  Right.
[54:58.280 --> 55:03.460]  Um, but I just think it makes it so interesting and a little sad because I do wish, I wish
[55:03.460 --> 55:06.440]  that they were independent so that I could just spend, cause I'm going to, I'm going
[55:06.440 --> 55:10.160]  to guess that that Samsung one is like 300 to $400.
[55:10.160 --> 55:15.280]  That's what I'm going to guess maybe, maybe up to five, but probably not.
[55:15.280 --> 55:17.240]  I just don't see how they can justify it.
[55:17.240 --> 55:20.560]  No, I wouldn't, I wouldn't think it's that much.
[55:20.560 --> 55:21.560]  I wouldn't think it's that much.
[55:21.560 --> 55:24.720]  I was wondering if it might be a little bit cheaper, like two 50.
[55:24.720 --> 55:25.720]  Yeah.
[55:25.720 --> 55:29.880]  Um, did you see, I know you mentioned this too in your article that there's a new moto,
[55:29.880 --> 55:35.100]  new generation of moto three sixties that are still, they're still two seventies.
[55:35.100 --> 55:41.400]  Even a year later, they've still got the, the flat tire design.
[55:41.400 --> 55:43.080]  I thought you made a mistake earlier.
[55:43.080 --> 55:46.400]  I get it now when you call it a two 70.
[55:46.400 --> 55:48.080]  Oh, I've been doing that for a while.
[55:48.080 --> 55:50.480]  I've been doing that all year.
[55:50.480 --> 55:57.080]  I really want every, I wish that they just renamed it in the moto two 70.
[55:57.080 --> 55:58.080]  It is smaller.
[55:58.080 --> 56:03.600]  Um, but did you notice that they've come out and again, I wouldn't call this copying apple,
[56:03.600 --> 56:10.120]  but it's come out with a very large variety of colors and bands and straps, you know,
[56:10.120 --> 56:13.360]  to choose from.
[56:13.360 --> 56:18.240]  I wouldn't say that that's ripping off apple at all because you know, that's just, you
[56:18.240 --> 56:24.240]  know, but it's just interesting to me though, that apple defined this, that aspect of the
[56:24.240 --> 56:27.160]  smartwatch right away.
[56:27.160 --> 56:31.560]  You know, that, that the way to go is to be, you know, to have, you know, get in all the
[56:31.560 --> 56:39.760]  accessories right and cover of, uh, uh, a reasonable range of styles, which is interesting
[56:39.760 --> 56:47.920]  that they, they, cause they have never done that with the iPhone particularly or the iPad.
[56:47.920 --> 56:52.120]  They'll make, they'll make a couple of cases and that's it.
[56:52.120 --> 56:53.120]  Yeah.
[56:53.120 --> 56:57.360]  I guess they had, I guess they have a few, they have a few iPhone cases now, don't they?
[56:57.360 --> 57:02.600]  They have like a leather one and a plastic one, but they, yeah, but it's not a big deal.
[57:02.600 --> 57:07.880]  It's nowhere near as, and they have lots of watch bands now and that's one of the things
[57:07.880 --> 57:10.920]  that may be coming next week is more, more bands.
[57:10.920 --> 57:11.920]  Yeah.
[57:11.920 --> 57:15.840]  Well, I, one thing I do notice, like, so for example, I saw a ton of iPhones yesterday
[57:15.840 --> 57:23.580]  just because there was a, uh, like a huge free music festival this weekend here in Philly.
[57:23.580 --> 57:30.320]  It's like Jay-Z and Beyonce and it's like the Budweiser made in America fest or something.
[57:30.320 --> 57:35.160]  I mean like seriously, like hundreds of thousands of people out on our Parkway and of course
[57:35.160 --> 57:39.880]  I did not go, go to it, but I went for a run yesterday and I thought, well, I'm going to
[57:39.880 --> 57:44.000]  go, you know, that there, that gives me like a target, uh, you know, a couple of miles
[57:44.000 --> 57:47.900]  and I could go up there and check it out and you know, thousands, I mean just thousands
[57:47.900 --> 57:52.320]  of people were heading towards it and you know, lots and lots of people, uh, with their
[57:52.320 --> 57:53.320]  phones out.
[57:53.320 --> 57:58.400]  Um, and I, it's just, it just struck me yesterday that, you know, every, it just seems like
[57:58.400 --> 58:04.040]  almost everybody has a phone or an iPhone and, uh, I could tell, you know, you always
[58:04.040 --> 58:06.800]  tell from the camera placement if it's an iPhone because the iPhone is the only one
[58:06.800 --> 58:08.400]  that has it up in the corner.
[58:08.400 --> 58:13.820]  Um, and that everybody has a case and that I, I don't think I saw anybody with the same
[58:13.820 --> 58:15.020]  case as each other.
[58:15.020 --> 58:18.400]  Like I think if I had taken a picture of every single person I saw with an iPhone and it
[58:18.400 --> 58:24.320]  would have been dozens and dozens of people, um, that no two people have the same case,
[58:24.320 --> 58:26.320]  you know, it's tons of variety there.
[58:26.320 --> 58:30.360]  And I kind of feel like that's a less, I feel like Apple has sort of embraced that.
[58:30.360 --> 58:35.600]  I, and the more I think about it as the years gone on, like, um, that that's why the camera
[58:35.600 --> 58:36.600]  bump is there.
[58:36.600 --> 58:39.560]  That's why they were willing to live with it because they realized that most people,
[58:39.560 --> 58:41.800]  um, we're going to use it in a case anyway.
[58:41.800 --> 58:43.640]  And so the camera bump doesn't matter.
[58:43.640 --> 58:44.640]  Yeah.
[58:44.640 --> 58:48.840]  Even though for people like me, it breaks my heart every single day.
[58:48.840 --> 58:49.840]  The camera bump.
[58:49.840 --> 58:50.840]  Yeah.
[58:50.840 --> 58:51.840]  Every day.
[58:51.840 --> 58:54.800]  There's not a day single, not a single day has gone by in the last year that I have.
[58:54.800 --> 58:58.480]  It has not occurred to me at least at some point when my finger has encountered that
[58:58.480 --> 59:01.360]  bump that, uh, this is gross.
[59:01.360 --> 59:02.360]  Wow.
[59:02.360 --> 59:03.360]  Huh?
[59:03.360 --> 59:04.360]  Every day.
[59:04.360 --> 59:05.360]  I could feel like I've gotten used to it.
[59:05.360 --> 59:06.360]  No, no, no.
[59:06.360 --> 59:09.200]  I don't feel like I give it too much of a thought.
[59:09.200 --> 59:12.680]  Oh, well I buy and you don't, you don't use a case, right?
[59:12.680 --> 59:15.840]  No, I've never used the case, um, months ago for months.
[59:15.840 --> 59:18.860]  I thought like last year I thought, well, that's something that they could fix next
[59:18.860 --> 59:22.840]  year with the success because even with the S year where they don't really change the
[59:22.840 --> 59:27.700]  physical design, clearly, surely they could just make the camera flush with the back.
[59:27.700 --> 59:31.160]  But now I'm thinking I'm not expecting it next week.
[59:31.160 --> 59:35.200]  It's funny cause it's, you know, it's the way that I obsess over these tiny little details
[59:35.200 --> 59:40.020]  that, that most people don't, it's, it's like the main thing I'm curious about for next
[59:40.020 --> 59:42.440]  week is whether or not the new phones will have a bump.
[59:42.440 --> 59:46.640]  I think they probably will because I think that they've, I think that they've kind of
[59:46.640 --> 59:50.400]  given into the fact that most people use the phone in a case.
[59:50.400 --> 59:55.720]  Well, I mean, but isn't, isn't the reason there's a bump simply physics?
[59:55.720 --> 59:56.720]  Yeah.
[59:56.720 --> 59:57.720]  Yeah.
[59:57.720 --> 59:58.720]  Yeah.
[59:58.720 --> 01:00:03.240]  It's but they, you know, you know, so they, in order to get the right focal length, right?
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:04.240]  Right.
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:08.000]  They asked me, asked me a certain depth and they, because they want the phone to be thinner
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:14.960]  at some point the camera has to stick out well or that or they, if it didn't stick out,
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.620]  it would be a crappier camera, right?
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:21.680]  It would be a less visually, you know, w what would be the word would be a worse camera,
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:22.680]  right?
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:25.520]  You know, at some point, you know, but they could make it stick out more and have it be
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.720]  better.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:31.520]  So I think it should, I think it should be telescoping, right?
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:37.380]  I think that the old Apple, I think prior to last year, I think that it was just non-negotiable
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:41.440]  though that it was going to be flush and that they would, you know, here's how thick we'll
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.740]  make it with, you know, and taking all these factors into how thick the thing is going
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:50.640]  to be, how strong it is, how much battery they need, how, how can, you know, I, I think
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:55.840]  how thick an iPhone is, is probably, you know, an incredibly complex equation.
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:00.320]  It's not like they just decide it's all of these factors, how strong it is, is it gonna,
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:06.240]  you know, is it going to bend famously and you know, how good, how good will the camera
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.240]  be?
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:10.440]  And I think it's, you know, I think before though, they'd come to some conclusion and
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:14.760]  then they would make the best camera that would fit in that flush.
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:18.440]  Whereas last year they, you know, said we can make it this thin, but then the camera's
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:26.720]  just gonna kind of be crap and they like, you know, took a shot of whiskey and I just
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:27.720]  imagined it.
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:31.640]  I just imagined that Johnny Ive really had to take a, had to take a stiff, had to take
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:37.600]  a stiff drink to not like being told that physics is the way it was.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:41.440]  Let's take a break and then we'll talk about it next week because I have to tell you about
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:44.040]  my good friends at Fracture.
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:48.120]  These guys keep coming back, keep sponsoring the show and the reason is that people keep
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:51.240]  buying pictures from them and that's great.
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:55.220]  These are the guys, you guys know it, I know everybody's, unless you're a new listener,
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.760]  you know who Fracture is.
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:05.520]  They're a service, you send your digital photos to them and they print them directly on glass.
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:09.240]  Not really on the front of the glass, it's actually behind the glass, but it's an incredibly
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:12.000]  thin piece of glass.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.520]  All sorts of sizes ranging from little desktop ones, little square ones to big 23 by 29 ones,
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:22.520]  which is a really, really big size, really, really thin piece of glass.
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:26.680]  They print your image on the back of it so it shines through, but it's so thin it really
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:31.440]  does look like it's on the surface of the glass.
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:37.220]  And again, it's like that same effect as like when Apple started laminating the iPhone displays
[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:41.320]  to the touchscreen to the glass where it no longer looked like pixels under glass, it
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.240]  looked like pixels on the glass.
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:48.320]  That's exactly what these Fracture prints look like, really, really neat effect.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:54.000]  But also, and I'm stealing this from Marco's read on an ATP recently and I didn't really
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.780]  think about this until Marco said it, but because their glass is so thin, their pictures
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:01.760]  are super, super lightweight.
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:05.020]  And I've noticed that with the ones we have in our house too, it's usually with a reasonably
[01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:09.120]  sized picture and the frame and everything, it's a big heavy thing on the wall and I know
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:13.120]  there's, you know, you get the special things you tap in the wall and it's, you know, every
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:18.360]  time I used to hang pictures, I used to think this is never, this is never going to happen.
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:19.360]  And I'm not handy.
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:24.000]  So it's like, I feel like, you know, I'm going to have to call someone then when there's,
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.560]  you know, the picture collapses and takes out a big chunk of the wall.
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:29.120]  We get earthquakes out here too.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:30.120]  Yes.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.120]  You got a real thing.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.640]  The Fractures, they're so lightweight, I never have to worry.
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:36.900]  I never, I have a bunch of them hanging around the house and I realized that they're the
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:40.840]  only pictures I've ever hung where I've haven't walked, stepped away from it thinking I'm
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:45.520]  going to watch this fall in 10 seconds, really, really lightweight.
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.700]  It's just great.
[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:51.360]  It's so great that if you've ever tried this, you're never going to, it has occurred to
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:56.540]  me and I really do believe this, you're never ever going to hang your own photographs by
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:59.240]  printing it on paper and then putting them in a frame again.
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:02.640]  You're never going to use anything but Fracture.
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.600]  And it solves so many other problems too.
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:08.360]  Another problem, you go to Ikea and buy a frame and you put a picture in there, I never
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:13.600]  get the damn picture to sit so that when you close the thing up and you put all the clasps
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:18.680]  in and it just drops a little bit and you see like a piece of the backing behind the
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:19.680]  thing in there.
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:23.160]  Or your thumb, or your thumb prints on the inside of the glass.
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:25.000]  Yeah, it's a mess.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.200]  Like the old way of doing it, I've been thinking about this lately because I've been trying
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.520]  to think of new things to say about Fracture and that's another one.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:34.140]  It's like the old way of doing it where you have a picture that's printed out and you
[01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:35.480]  put it in a frame.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.320]  It's a huge pain in the ass.
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.240]  It's an enormous pain in the ass.
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:40.520]  Fracture solves all these problems.
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:44.680]  So any time you need to print a picture, just go to Fracture.
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:46.960]  I can't even see why you would do anything else.
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:49.460]  Here's the other thing.
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:50.460]  What's the code?
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:51.460]  I don't even know.
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:54.560]  The goddamn notes don't have a code but I could probably find it.
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:55.960]  I bet they've sponsored the show recently.
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:59.260]  I'll just go to my website.
[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:00.260]  Probably the talk show.
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:01.260]  What do you think?
[01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:02.260]  What's your guess?
[01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:04.360]  Sounds about right.
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:05.360]  That would be my guess.
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:06.360]  Nope.
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.360]  Daring Fireball.
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.360]  Oh.
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:09.360]  Okay.
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.360]  We should just make it a game.
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:13.880]  Let's make it a game for all these sponsors what the code is.
[01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:17.300]  Well, anyway, use that code, Daring Fireball.
[01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:20.620]  When you go to fracture, fractureme.com is their URL.
[01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:21.620]  Go there.
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:28.040]  Use that code when you print your pictures out and you will save 15% off your first order.
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:31.280]  I really do mean this in complete sincerity.
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:35.520]  Even if they never sponsored my show again, I can't imagine why you would ever print a
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:39.300]  photo any other way to hang on your wall than to go to fracture.
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:41.400]  It's that good and that easy.
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.540]  My thanks to them.
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:43.540]  Go buy some pictures.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:44.540]  All right.
[01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:47.880]  What else have we got?
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:48.880]  We got next week.
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:49.880]  Should we talk about next week?
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:50.880]  Next week.
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.640]  Which is technically this week.
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:53.640]  Technically this week.
[01:05:53.640 --> 01:06:02.280]  So, in a couple of days, I will be flying to California and Apple is having an event.
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:03.560]  It's Wednesday, right?
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:09.680]  It's a Wednesday event, which is easy to figure out why.
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.160]  I'm not smart until somebody else told me this, but it's because they didn't want to
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:16.960]  make people fly on Labor Day.
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:21.780]  Apple loves us, we in the media, so much.
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:26.480]  So much respect for me that they wanted to make sure I got a complete three-day weekend
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:34.680]  to relax from my back-breaking schedule so that I didn't have to fly on Monday.
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:40.560]  And I guess, presumably, so that Apple themselves wouldn't have to work.
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:43.840]  I'm going to guess that most of the people involved in this event are probably pretty
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.040]  busy this weekend.
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:50.280]  That they're not really relaxing, but anyway.
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:53.760]  Which probably stinks, right?
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.120]  School starts for us this week.
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:56.120]  Yeah, same here.
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:59.800]  I think in California it started already, though.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.280]  I think it started last week.
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:05.600]  I mentioned that to somebody else and they said now school started last week.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:10.040]  Yeah, and there are a lot of places in Pennsylvania now that started last week, too.
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.040]  Which is crazy to me.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:15.360]  There are a lot of places that start in August, which to me just seems criminal.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:16.360]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.240]  Although, I mean, this year Labor Day is really late.
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.520]  Yeah, it is really late.
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:22.280]  So, starting after Labor Day is kind of late.
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:23.280]  Yeah.
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:30.160]  But there are also, I guess, too, you know what it might be, it might be too that I would
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:36.700]  not be surprised one bit if this facility that places has some kind of union workers
[01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:40.720]  that cannot be, you know, have to get off for Labor Day.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.720]  Yeah.
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:45.960]  And that they definitely need to be in there doing stuff the day before.
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:47.960]  So anyway, it's all because of Labor Day.
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:50.840]  Thanks, Labor Day.
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:51.840]  Thanks for nothing.
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:52.840]  All right.
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:58.220]  So, one of the things that might, okay, so new phones, right?
[01:07:58.220 --> 01:07:59.600]  New phones are a sure thing.
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:05.200]  I think that, you know, there's the surest thing in the universe regarding this event.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.360]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:10.400]  And Mark Gurman says they might actually be thicker.
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.400]  Yeah.
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:16.760]  Slightly, just slightly, maybe for most people, imperceptibly thicker.
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:17.760]  Yeah.
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:21.600]  I think that that's, I think he's not even alone in reporting that.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:25.320]  A lot of the stuff that's come out, God damn kid has some sources.
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:26.320]  Yeah.
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:29.920]  Although some of them it's weird, it's weird who some of his sources are.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:35.780]  Like what they, I know him well enough and I do trust him.
[01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:40.520]  I think every single word he writes is true, but that doesn't mean that all the things
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:42.240]  he says are going to happen are going to happen.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:48.000]  Like he's always, you know, he'll say that, you know, like that he gave away the name
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.280]  of the force touch screen, that it's the 3D touch screen, that's what they're going to
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.280]  call it.
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:56.240]  But that his source, and this is just like yesterday or the day before, but as sources
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:57.880]  said, you know, that it could change.
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:04.040]  Well, it's like, I believe him that somebody within Apple told him that that at some point
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:07.840]  they were thinking about calling it the 3D touch screen or whatever he says they're going
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:08.960]  to call it.
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:13.660]  But if his source really knew, they would, you know, today, you know, like five days
[01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:16.760]  before the event, they would say they would know it for a fact.
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:17.760]  You know what I mean?
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:22.880]  So like what he wrote is exactly true that it could be, it could come out with another
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:25.800]  name, but that at some point that's what they were thinking about.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:28.800]  But that just, you know, but it's not surprising.
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:33.320]  It's not changing in between the time that the article is being published and the time
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:36.360]  of the announcement.
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:39.380]  They're not changing, they're not changing the name behind the scenes and then running
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:47.400]  out and sanding it off of a bunch of boxes or whatever, reprinting a bunch of 3D.
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:51.800]  He says they're going to call it the 3D touch display, which seems reasonable because it's,
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:52.800]  you know, got some kind of force.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:53.800]  Yeah.
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:56.680]  It's one of the, and it's, yeah, it's a technology that not everybody is.
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:57.680]  Yeah.
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:00.680]  Well, although, I mean, I guess, I guess it's going to be it, you know, if it's a feature
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:06.360]  that's, you know, one of the, we're on the talk here, right?
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:11.720]  And so they have to play up whatever they add to, in order to get people to, to go with
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:12.720]  that phone.
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:13.720]  Yeah.
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:17.920]  So the force touch aspect of it actually becomes a big deal.
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:18.920]  Yeah.
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:19.920]  Yeah.
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:24.080]  And the technology behind it becomes the kind of thing that you use to sell the, the idea
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:32.440]  of, okay, you can touch on things and you get like a added functionality by the different
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.680]  ways you press on them.
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:36.880]  Yeah.
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:40.160]  I think though it's interesting and he has a couple of, you know, he's written about
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.880]  before and, you know, a couple of ideas that you, you know, clearly somebody who's seen
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:48.960]  what they're tinkering with has spilled this to him, you know, that, that if you force
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:54.560]  touch on an icon on the home screen, that you'll get like a menu of options of what
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:57.960]  to do with the app, you know, that, you know, or that you could jump to something within
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:58.960]  the app.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:01.460]  So you could like just on the home screen force touch.
[01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:06.260]  This is an example that, that Gurman gave you force touch on the phone app and you'll
[01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:08.940]  get an option that would let you jump right to voicemail.
[01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:13.080]  So you don't have to launch the app and, you know, I don't know if that's, I don't know
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:16.640]  if that's actually even easier, but anyway, that's what he says.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:19.800]  But he doesn't really have a lot though about what they're going to do with force touch.
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:21.440]  What it's going to, how it's going to work.
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.440]  Yeah.
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:23.440]  Yeah.
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:29.000]  And it's, you know, it's just interesting how far down the chain, you know, his sources
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.960]  are because somebody within Apple knows everything about it.
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:35.640]  And they, I think that they've done actually a reasonably good job of keeping that under
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:36.640]  wraps.
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:37.640]  Yeah.
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:44.500]  It hasn't, there hasn't been any, you know, no screenshots, no anything.
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:47.720]  So Garmin has said though, that it's both cause they're, you know, Apple's using this
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.720]  for stuff in different ways, right?
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:58.760]  Like on the Mac books, it's a physical thing where you, you press it and it gives you this
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:04.900]  false sense, false sensation that there's a physical click on the watch.
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:07.280]  It doesn't feel like it clicks.
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.360]  It's just, it, it uses the vibration.
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:11.360]  Yeah.
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:14.480]  It uses the taptic engine, but it doesn't feel like the screen clicks.
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.680]  It feels like the watch itself is, yeah, it just gives you a tap, but it doesn't feel
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:22.600]  like the screen clicks.
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:28.920]  I wonder, you know, which way, and it doesn't seem clear to me from the rumors and I'm glad,
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:32.600]  I'm kind of excited to find out how it works, like which way the phones are going to work.
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:37.380]  Is it just going to be like once in a while you force tap and the phone will give you
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:43.320]  a vibration to let you know that, yes, that registered as a phone tap, which is I think
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:48.560]  what's more likely because it seems simpler or is it going to be more like the Mac book
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:52.560]  keyboard where when you click buttons on the screen, it feels like the screen is clicking
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:56.880]  where you tapped it, which would be kind of amazing, but I'm almost like, that's what
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:00.240]  I'm hoping for, but I almost feel like that's what I would hope for too.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.240]  Yeah.
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:04.680]  But I feel like I'm hoping, you know, you know, to hit the lottery.
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:05.680]  You know what I mean?
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:07.640]  But I don't feel like that's a realistic hope.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:08.640]  Realistic hope.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.640]  Yeah.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:11.020]  Well, that may be.
[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:16.800]  And I wonder if the thickness is related to that screen or if the thickness is more battery.
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:21.560]  Well, but the rumor, again, you know, we're all dependent on Germin here, but I think
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:26.000]  it was Germin at least who says that the batteries are actually smaller.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.360]  Now, that could just, you know, that they're actually fewer megawatt hours.
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:31.360]  Physically smaller.
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.360]  Yeah.
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:33.360]  Oh, oh, oh, actually less power?
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.360]  Yeah.
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:36.360]  So whatever that, what's the metric for batteries?
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:43.240]  Megawatt hours, whatever it is, you know, those numbers that are like in the 1800, 2000 range
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:45.420]  that they're actually a little smaller in both phones.
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:49.640]  But that could be though, you could be the same thing that to fit the forced screen in
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:54.720]  there and whatever else they're fitting in left less room for battery.
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:59.120]  So they made it a little thicker so they could at least like if they hadn't made it thicker,
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:03.080]  then the battery would even be smaller than the actual decrease that they're going to
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:04.080]  do.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:05.080]  Right?
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:06.080]  Yeah.
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:09.760]  They had to decrease the battery because of whatever the else they're putting in there.
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:13.520]  And if they hadn't made it a little thicker, they would have had to make it even more of
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:14.840]  a drop.
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:15.840]  Yeah.
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:18.400]  Are you in the more battery camp?
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:23.280]  Because there was a big sort of a surge of people within the last year who were saying
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:27.600]  enough with making them thinner, just make the battery last longer.
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:28.760]  Yeah.
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:29.920]  Yeah.
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:38.960]  I, I think if they asked me, I would rather have the iPhone seven not decrease.
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:41.120]  And in fact here, I'm just looking at nine to five Mac.
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.800]  There's actually a report here, just not a Gurman.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:50.800]  It's they're reporting on Ming Chi Kuo, who knows, you know, these, the KGI analyst over
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:54.880]  in Asia who's had pretty good supply chain sources.
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:01.600]  He says that next year's phone, which, you know, would according to plans be, or to tradition
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:07.380]  be the iPhone seven is going to be as thin as the iPhone iPod touches.
[01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:10.760]  That's actually been, that's actually been the case all along.
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:16.040]  It maybe not exactly to the 10th of a millimeter, but at least in general, every, you know,
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:20.940]  the way that after the first round, the, the, actually even from the original, even the
[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:24.080]  original iPod touch was thinner than the iPhone.
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:26.640]  iPhones have always gotten next generation.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:32.260]  iPhones have always been as thick as the iPod touches that came out before, like the current
[01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:37.200]  iPhone six is as thin as the iPod touch.
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:41.700]  And so when the iPod touch, the current design came out, you know, the one that originally
[01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:46.280]  came with the wristband wrist strap attachment.
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:52.080]  That was when the iPhone five came out.
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:56.120]  And I remember, I've said this before, I was, I remember it was the, so the iPhone five
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:58.580]  came out and was really nice.
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:01.840]  I think I'd still like my favorite hardware design.
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:06.480]  Um, really, really nice, but it came out alongside those iPod touches.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:11.440]  And I remember, uh, at the press event I was hanging around with MG Ciggler and we, the,
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:15.720]  the table with the iPhones was super crowded, three deep.
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:20.520]  Everybody wanted to, and, and these people on a deadline at these events are always there.
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:26.360]  I don't know, they're very rude, but everybody wants to get pictures, right?
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:32.060]  And so when you read these reports and, uh, like from home of people at the press, people
[01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:38.880]  at this event and they're showing pictures from the hands on area, um, they're usually
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:42.600]  good photos and the people taking the photos are pretty good at framing.
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:45.740]  Um, but it's, it's actually behind the scenes there.
[01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:52.960]  If you're there, it's actually really like, there's a lot of, uh, jostling to get everybody
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:57.240]  else's hands out of the way, you know, so that they can get a shot of just the phone
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:58.560]  and make it look nice.
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:04.400]  And you know, uh, it's actually, it really, it's, it, uh, I don't know, I just wait, I
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:08.400]  wait until, you know, it clears out and then I, you know, go over on.
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:12.880]  So MG and I went over to the iPod table because it was, you know, mostly clear.
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:17.080]  Uh, and we had spent a couple seconds with the iPhone five and we were both excited about
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:18.080]  it.
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:19.080]  It looks really nice.
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:21.280]  And then we looked at this iPod and we're like, holy crap, is this thin?
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:26.880]  This blow, you know, we didn't even, we didn't even get to use the new iPhone five yet.
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:30.280]  And we were already like kind of disappointed by how thick it was because these iPods are
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:34.900]  so amazing that, and that, but that's how thin the iPhone six was two years later.
[01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:36.240]  And so it's always been the case.
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:41.360]  And now here, Ming Chi Kuo is saying that next year's is going to be as, uh, you know,
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.000]  even thinner.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:48.680]  Um, and so I, you know, that's the way Apple rolls, but, uh, I'm with you.
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:52.880]  I would rather have them just say, just, this is thin enough and just fill it with battery.
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:55.040]  Oh, I'm actually not in that camp.
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.040]  Well, not necessarily.
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.560]  I get enough battery life.
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:59.400]  I don't go anywhere for the most part.
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:05.900]  So I have enough battery life to get through the day and then recharge it with the watch.
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:08.200]  So I don't usually have much of a problem.
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:10.320]  And if I do go someplace, I'm usually driving my car.
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.520]  I just plug it into the car.
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.520]  Yeah.
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:13.520]  I will say that I will.
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:16.560]  And I will say too, I don't feel strongly about it because I'm trying to remember the
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:20.240]  last time my phone died before the end of the day.
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:25.200]  And it might, it might actually be the case that it was a previous iPhone that I've never
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:29.280]  once not gotten through the day in the last year with my iPhone six.
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:35.840]  Um, I think, I think the problem is more the incidents, incidents they have that are somehow
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:41.720]  software caused because occasionally the phone will just inexplicably start losing battery
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:42.920]  life like crazy.
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:47.540]  Like one day I'll wake up and it'll just be much draining, much faster than it did the
[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:50.800]  previous day for no apparent reason.
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:56.080]  And usually just rebooting the phone clears it up more or it clears up on its own for
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:59.640]  some reason that I haven't been able to fathom.
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:06.800]  So, so I think it, I don't know if it's managing processes better or what it is, but there's
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.800]  some, there's some software related thing that's more the problem than the, uh, than
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:11.800]  the battery size.
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:12.800]  Yeah.
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:17.260]  And you know, one reason I've, I've been able to get through the year without never ever
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:21.520]  once having my phone die by the end of the day is that when I anticipate that I'm going
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:26.640]  to be using it heavily and in a bandwidth or in a battery draining situation like Disney
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:27.640]  world is perfect example.
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:34.800]  A day at Disney world, sorry, I take a stand-alone Mophie pack with me and you know, to me that's
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:35.800]  a reasonable trade off.
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:39.400]  So I don't feel strongly about it, you know, so, but you do think, you think it Apple's
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.200]  right to keep making them thinner?
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.320]  Uh, well I wouldn't, um, I don't know.
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:50.400]  I mean, I, I would think what would be right is what hits the more, the more most users.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:52.920]  And I don't really know which, which one that is.
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:57.960]  One of the things, one thing that I will say though, is that the only thing that I ever
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:01.440]  looked when I looked at Android phones over the years, the only thing that I was ever
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:06.440]  covetous of was their thinner was the ones that were super thin.
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:11.880]  And so this phone is now, I mean, I feel like that the six is thin enough.
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:17.440]  I want it to be smaller across, but I'm not going to get that this year.
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:20.840]  It doesn't look like I asked Schiller about that on stage, right?
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:25.040]  I'm not misremembering that because if I didn't, I wanted to the battery, the battery
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:26.040]  thing.
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:27.040]  Yeah.
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:28.040]  Yes.
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:29.040]  Yeah.
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:30.040]  Yeah.
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:31.040]  I think you did.
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:32.040]  Yeah.
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:33.040]  And I seem to recall his answer was there.
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:38.120]  It was, it wasn't really a concrete, look, here's the X, Y, Z, therefore they get there.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:42.040]  It's more or less, you know, we're trying to, we're trying to do both.
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:47.800]  Well, no, I think it was a very polite way of saying that I was wrong and I believe him.
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:48.800]  You know what I mean?
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:51.680]  I don't know, like he's got access to information that I don't have.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:55.780]  And I, I do think part of it too, is it is a factor.
[01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:57.280]  It's a lust factor, right?
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:01.700]  Which is look, they're, they're in the business of selling new iPhones.
[01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:03.480]  That's the business, right?
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:08.760]  And part of that, a huge part of that is to keep iPhone users happy so that they come
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:10.880]  back and buy another one.
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:14.820]  And so obviously that it is a balancing act because they don't want to make it so crazy
[01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:20.360]  thin that everybody's batteries die, in which case, you know, people would be, it would
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:24.440]  be a very likely reason that would make someone switch is if they really felt like their battery
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.400]  was dying every day.
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:29.160]  So they definitely want to avoid that.
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:32.480]  But I think a huge factor though, is that showroom appeal, right?
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:35.720]  That you're in the, you go in the Apple store and you think maybe I'll buy a new iPhone
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:39.720]  and then you see it and it fills your heart with that lust.
[01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:42.720]  And then all of a sudden you're walking, you don't even remember what happened.
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:47.560]  You're walking out and you have a new iPhone and the battery's drained already, but that's
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:50.880]  obviously that is, that's, that's part of the appeal, right?
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:56.600]  The batteries dead by the time you get to the car, uh, the, the, those crazy cool phones
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:59.920]  from, um, looper.
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.200]  Remember you've seen looper, right?
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:02.200]  I have seen looper.
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.200]  I don't remember the phones.
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:05.040]  It was just a piece of glass.
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:10.280]  It was just glass, um, just a piece of glass that when you, you know, it's like clear when
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:15.400]  you, when it's off and you turn it on and the screen fills up that it was like insane,
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:19.000]  you know, literally could not be thinner, like you wouldn't want it then unless it was
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.840]  like paper, like it couldn't be thinner unless it was more like an index card than glass.
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:29.560]  Um, you know, I think, you know, clearly that's where we're heading.
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:35.680]  I don't know how, how we get there, but you know, thinner is, is, is unavoidable.
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:40.880]  I guess what I would say is I think Apple maybe should just, if I were, if they wanted
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:46.560]  my advice, maybe dial back on that a little bit in favor of battery life.
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:55.560]  But um, so anyway, we were talking about new iPhones, forced touch, 3d display, touch display,
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:56.560]  better camera.
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:57.560]  Yeah.
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:01.200]  So my thought too, I've said this before, but my thought, if my dream comes true and,
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:05.860]  and the taps, you feel them when you press, uh, it would be that, that you can actually
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:12.880]  feel the keyboard when you're typing like I, and again, that sounds to me too good to
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:13.880]  be true.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:18.040]  Um, but boy, that would be cool if they pulled that off.
[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:19.880]  That would be, yeah, that seems awful.
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:20.880]  Fine.
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:21.880]  Right.
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:22.880]  Right.
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:23.880]  And really fast.
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:24.880]  Right.
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:28.060]  Cause it would have to, you know, to be, to be useful at all, it would have to have like
[01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:29.060]  no latency.
[01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:30.060]  Yeah.
[01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:32.920]  Have you ever used an Android phone that vibrates when you type?
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:33.920]  No.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:34.920]  Yeah.
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:38.240]  I've, uh, I think my, uh, nexus, whatever.
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:40.440]  I don't have the like latest and greatest nexus.
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:45.720]  I have like a year old nexus that I bought, um, you know, just to, Oh no, no, I didn't
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:46.720]  buy the nexus.
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:49.840]  I bought the, the Motorola one with the wooden back, whatever it's called.
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:55.840]  I don't remember, um, uh, it, when you type on it, it's an option.
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:57.640]  You can obviously turn it off when you type on it.
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:04.080]  It vibrates like with each tap and it does a very good job of not falling behind, but
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:07.720]  I, I, I just don't find it to be useful.
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:13.320]  I don't know why, but if the, but if it was local localized right where, if it felt like
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:17.320]  I was actually clicking the key on the screen, that would be, that would be awesome.
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.520]  I don't think that's possible.
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.080]  I sure hope so.
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:23.720]  Uh, what else is coming out with the phone?
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:24.720]  Oh, why you asked?
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:26.960]  Why do you, why do I think they made it thicker?
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:28.440]  I guess we covered that.
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:29.600]  Did you see the report?
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:35.880]  Did you see the video where the one guy, uh, the baseball cap guy, uh, you know, I mean
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:38.840]  it's, he's like the unboxed Joe.
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.960]  I think his name is unboxed Joe.
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:45.920]  He's a YouTuber and he always wears a baseball cap, uh, backwards.
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:50.040]  And he's the guy who kind of got the whole Ben Gate thing rolling last year.
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:54.560]  Um, when he bent, he's the guy who bent the phone with his hands.
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:25:05.160]  Uh, somehow he procured what was claimed to be a iPhone success, a frame, just the, just
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:06.160]  the aluminum part.
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:12.160]  Uh, and he had a very, you know, um, I'm kind of ripping on him here, but he had a really
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:18.120]  good video where he took it to like a serious, like, um, um, you know, engineering shop and
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:22.960]  they like, uh, tested the, they use some kind of fancy equipment to test the aluminum and
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:28.080]  sort of prove that it's like a, it's like a new, like 7,000 series aluminum.
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:29.080]  Right.
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:30.080]  Right.
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:31.080]  I had heard that part.
[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:34.600]  I had heard that part, but I did not know that it came from there.
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:35.600]  Yeah.
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:38.920]  Uh, unbox therapy is his name.
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:39.920]  Okay.
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:42.440]  And that's kind of, I mean, they did that with the improved the materials between the
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:44.480]  five and the five S as well.
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:50.440]  Uh, yeah, I think so too, but yeah, cause my five, my, I had, I had the space gray five
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:56.320]  S scratch to hell, um, but not so with the space gray five S. Yeah.
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:02.080]  So he, I'll put that in the show notes, uh, hopefully, um, uh, but yeah, the unbox therapy
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:06.760]  has an interesting video and it, it, it almost certainly is a legit, I don't know how this
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:11.320]  stuff, you know, somebody smoke it out of a factory in Foxconn and somehow send it to
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:15.240]  him and, but he also stress tested it and like measured how many foot pounds of force
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:20.520]  takes to actually bend the frame and it's like enormously more durable than, than, than
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:23.960]  the iPhone six and six plus.
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:27.000]  I hope the iPad pros made out of the same stuff.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:32.040]  Oh, I want to do, you've been like crazy, right?
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:34.840]  Um, uh, what else?
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:42.160]  Gurman says that they're going to keep both the six and the six plus in the lineup.
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:45.880]  You know, that, uh, which I think makes sense.
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:50.600]  I think, you know, uh, and it's also widely reported, you know, because there's none of
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:57.480]  these supply chain links, you know, it's, it's almost the lack of, of, of leaks of a
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:04.480]  six C plastic six C, which you and I were thinking they would do like when we took hoping
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:07.880]  they would do, but I've given up all hope on that because I mean, there's no way they're
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:08.880]  going to do that.
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:09.880]  Yeah.
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:12.680]  They're going to do the most obvious thing possible, which is what they've done every
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:13.680]  other year.
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:16.920]  Other than that five C year is just move last year's phone down.
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:19.840]  And the fact that there were two last year, it just means there's two now this year, you
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:26.920]  know, and that you can choose the 4.7 inch or the 5.5 inch and whatever.
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:28.800]  Hmm.
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:32.720]  Oh, well maybe next year.
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:33.720]  Yeah.
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:34.720]  Um, I don't think so.
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:36.640]  I, I don't think even next year really.
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:37.640]  Yeah.
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:38.640]  I've come around.
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:39.640]  I've changed my mind.
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:42.720]  I think that the four inch phones are gone forever.
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:46.320]  Well there was a, there was even a rumor though that, that they were, I mean, this was just
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:51.720]  like a prototype, but that they had a 3.5 inch phone that they were working on.
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:52.720]  I heard that.
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:53.720]  I'm surprised.
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:55.840]  Uh, I don't think so though.
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:57.800]  I just don't, I don't, I don't see them doing that.
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:03.400]  I, I'm not surprised that they tinkered with it, but um, I don't know.
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:06.680]  I just kind of, my gut feeling, I hope I'm wrong.
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:07.680]  I do.
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:11.520]  I do hope I'm wrong and I would love to see them come out with a new four inch phone or
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:12.520]  even smaller.
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:17.240]  I probably would not buy smaller, but I would be very tempted to buy a new four inch one
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:18.360]  that had good specs.
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:22.160]  But if I could get this year's specs and a four inch phone, I would definitely get the
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:24.720]  four inch phone over over the 4.7 right.
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:25.720]  I wouldn't hesitate either.
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:26.720]  I would definitely do it.
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:30.500]  But I think the problem that it will obviously be that you won't get this year's specs you
[01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:31.500]  get last year's.
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:32.500]  Yeah.
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:37.720]  Uh, the best that we could hope for is to, uh, to get it to, you know, get like the equivalent
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:41.680]  of a five C last year specs in a smaller size.
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:46.320]  Uh, they got a new, they're supposedly a new rose gold color.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:50.360]  I don't really care.
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:51.360]  Yeah.
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:57.440]  I'm not surprised that the only time, the only time that I have been tempted by or actually
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:02.880]  thought that I should have gotten a different color was the five, uh, partially because
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:09.480]  like I, like I said, the space gray one nicked like crazy and, and I also just really liked
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:11.680]  that shape in the, in the white color.
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:17.140]  Uh, but yeah, I know we're repeating ourselves here, but I, but the, the, the space gray
[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:22.280]  one that Nick really easily, I, the first couple of nicks annoyed me and then once it
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:25.480]  kind of all got scuffed up, I thought it really looked good.
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:30.440]  Like in a star wars, you know, beat up, you know, you know what I mean?
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:34.680]  I thought it, you know, like in a way that, that, uh, your jeans look good after you've,
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:37.720]  you know, worn them a couple of times, you know, I don't know.
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:42.200]  I thought it had like a cool, like, uh, you know, I don't know, I'm sure somebody at Apple
[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:47.480]  is, is dying hearing that because they may not, may not look like much, but she's got
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:48.480]  it where it counts.
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:51.200]  I don't, I don't know that Apple was shooting for it.
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:52.200]  Looks good.
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:58.280]  I don't think so either, but you know, but my, I still got my original iPhones and they're
[01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:04.440]  dings like crazy to scuffed and, uh, what else with iPhones or anything else with iPhone
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:05.440]  that we expect?
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:06.440]  I don't think so.
[01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:09.720]  I mean, I think the big stuff is other things, right?
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:14.560]  I mean, this is the talk here, so it's going to be same form factor and just like, you
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:19.160]  know, possibly the Siri this year is the, uh, force touch stuff.
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:20.800]  Yeah, that's what I think.
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:26.360]  Uh, I guess a wildcard would be whether there's like a serious, big, worth bragging about
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:29.440]  improvement to the camera, but I'm not really expecting that.
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:34.080]  I just feel like, you know, there'll be some kind of improvement, whether it's megapixels
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:38.960]  or something, but I don't think it'll be like a, a great leap forward.
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:39.960]  Yeah.
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:46.240]  Uh, I talked a months ago, maybe even a year ago where I had heard, uh, from, as they say
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:50.760]  a little birdie, that Apple was working on a thing with a two camera system, which I
[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:54.400]  don't really understand the physics of, and I've read some pieces from people speculating
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:57.720]  about how that would work and it is fascinating to me, but the basic gist is that there'd
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:02.840]  be a camera, a camera that has two lenses right next to each other.
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:08.600]  So sort of like, um, sort of like, I guess it'd be closer though, but like it would just
[01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:14.160]  be two circles right next to each other and that somehow it's like one is focusing far
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:19.480]  and one's focusing near and then somehow it, it, it gives amazing results in the resulting
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:22.280]  image like SLR quality photos.
[01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:25.920]  And I, I think when I, I think I wrote about it, not podcasted about it, and I said the
[01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:32.560]  next iPhone and I didn't mean this year's, I didn't mean that it was, that it was something
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:33.560]  for the success.
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:36.940]  I meant the next iPhone, like the next iPhone form factor, because I don't think that that
[01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:42.960]  sort of thing they would ever do in the S year because it, it would break like the rules
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:48.200]  of, you know, the S year, like the S year rules are that it's the phone supposed to
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:53.480]  fit in last year's cases, which I guess is interesting if it is thicker, like you said,
[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:55.960]  like how many cases will still fit the phone.
[01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:56.960]  That's interesting.
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:00.280]  Well, they see, I mean, Gurman seemed to think that it should still fit all of it.
[01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:01.280]  Yeah.
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:02.280]  Cause it's not that much thicker.
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:03.280]  Yeah.
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:07.180]  It sounds like it's, you know, like, like, like the difference in thickness, you really
[01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:09.400]  would have to like take out calipers and measure it.
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:13.080]  You probably couldn't do it with your, with your hands.
[01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:18.200]  Do you, do you think they're going to have trouble blowing past last year's numbers because
[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:24.760]  last year's numbers were so huge and because they had a pent up demand of people who wanted
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:25.760]  a larger phone?
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:28.040]  I, I think that that's probably true.
[01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:34.380]  I think, and I just feel like the anecdotal explanation that you just gave just a basic,
[01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:41.160]  you know, lots of people had heard that they were going to do a bigger phone for a long
[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:46.020]  enough, you know, like that rumor was, it was over a year old and you know, it's weird.
[01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:50.440]  It's weird the way that like regular people know about Apple rumors now.
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:53.380]  You know, cause people would ask me, you know, in advance, is Apple really going to do a
[01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:54.380]  bigger phone?
[01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:58.140]  And the fact that people were asking me that it was like, wow, they're, people really do
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:32:59.800]  want bigger phones.
[01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:03.880]  And I think you're right that there's an awful lot of people who put off buying an iPhone
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:08.600]  that overly inflated last year's iPhone sales.
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:09.600]  Yeah.
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:15.720]  And I think, I think people held off long enough that it's not the kind of thing where
[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:20.000]  the contract is going to be the issue.
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.660]  Like so it's not like, okay, well yeah, but there were those people last year, but there's
[01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:26.720]  a whole set of new people who just came off contract for this year.
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:27.720]  Yeah.
[01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:31.320]  I also think that there might be, it might be tough to, to meet the sales that they did
[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:32.520]  in China.
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:35.760]  I don't know though, cause they're, it's like they're growing so fast in China, but it felt
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:40.320]  like last year was the year they were, where they really exploded in China and that if
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:46.140]  there was pent up demand, they sold crazy big numbers to meet them and that they might
[01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:47.140]  have trouble doing that.
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:52.440]  But maybe I'm underestimating just how many, just how many truly like maybe like tens of
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:58.440]  millions of first time iPhone buyers there are going to expand in China.
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:33:59.440]  That's kind of what I think will happen.
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:04.180]  I mean the economy there is, is, is a concern, but it seems like they, they haven't topped
[01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:05.360]  out there yet.
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:10.920]  Like they're, they did run up past the Xiaomi, right?
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:11.920]  Yeah.
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:19.360]  Like in the second quarter I want to say, but, um, but there's still, they were still,
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:22.960]  I mean they had good growth, but they weren't big enough in China to that point where they've
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:25.800]  actually like saturated it.
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:26.800]  Yeah.
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:32.040]  And the other thing too about the economy being weak is that I think it might affect
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:36.560]  everything other than phones first because phones have turned into this weird thing that
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:39.640]  everybody who has one thinks is essential.
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:40.640]  Right?
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:47.720]  Like, so the economy goes bad and like vacation resorts suffer because like that's one thing
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:48.720]  people do.
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:54.000]  Like if you know, they're, they're investments have gone down or you know, taking a pay cut
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.680]  or if you're like a small business owner and the business is down, you'd cut back on vacations,
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:34:58.680]  right?
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:04.040]  Or you cut back on a jewelry or you know, all sorts of things that when the economy
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:06.000]  goes bad, definitely suffer.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:10.760]  But I feel like phones maybe are maybe not immune to it, but are strong resistance to
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:14.640]  it because people, even if the economy is bad and you're cutting back in other areas,
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:16.960]  if you need a new phone, you're still getting a new phone.
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:19.440]  And if you're going to get a new phone, you're going to get the one you want.
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:20.440]  Yeah.
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:21.440]  I think.
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:22.440]  So I don't know.
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:26.520]  I feel like the, the, you know, and I, you know, I thought it was really, really telling
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:31.000]  that Tim Cook had that public statement, you know, to, uh, what's his name, Jimmy Kramer
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.720]  on CNBC the other day, the other week, um, that's going to, he's going to jail because
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:41.920]  I guess there was a concern he could get, he could get fined.
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:42.920]  I don't know.
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:45.440]  I, you know, Tim Cook seems like such a cautious person.
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:49.800]  Like Steve Jobs was the type of person who, if he wanted to do it, was going to do it.
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:53.320]  And then he'd figure out the, you know, like, and infamously, you know, really did get into
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:56.520]  trouble with the, uh, the backdating of the stock options.
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:57.520]  Right.
[01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:58.520]  Right.
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:35:59.720]  I was, I guess, you know, that was pretty bad.
[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:06.960]  Tim Cook is so deliberate, or at least he seems to be that I'll, I w I would be very
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:14.320]  surprised if that hadn't been vetted by apples, you know, like sec compliance lawyers.
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:19.600]  Like it just seems to me like from what I can tell if Tim Cook's personality, that if
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:25.440]  he wanted to do that, he called up, you know, whether it was their general counsel, you
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:28.880]  know, it would probably just called the general counsel guy and then said, here's what I want
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:29.880]  to do.
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:33.920]  Let me, you know, here's the, you know, here's the exact thing I want to email Jim Kramer.
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:35.800]  I want to do it tomorrow at 9am.
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:36.800]  Is this okay?
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:41.200]  I would be very surprised if he didn't do that now, just because one lawyer at apples
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:42.640]  looks at it and says, yeah, that's fine.
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:46.460]  That doesn't mean, you know, there's been a lot of cases where, you know, one lawyer
[01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:47.460]  saying it's okay.
[01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:50.640]  That doesn't mean that somebody could do, but I haven't seen anything that anybody's
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:51.640]  looking into it.
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:52.640]  Right.
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:56.880]  I saw it's just idle speculation that, you know, right.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:57.880]  What's the gist of the rule?
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:01.160]  The gist of the rule is it's just that, yeah, I don't know.
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:02.160]  I don't know the gist.
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:03.160]  Yeah.
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:04.160]  I don't know.
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:09.840]  Something, something about giving information, any information that you give that would be
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:13.000]  of interest to some investors, you have to give to all of them.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000]  Right.
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  Right.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  So that, you know, there's certain.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  That sounds right.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  Yeah.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  Right.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:23.800]  So, you know, obviously the, the, the worst example would be if Tim Cook just called Jim
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:28.440]  Kramer up on the phone and said, just between me and you, well, well, yeah.
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:29.440]  Okay.
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:30.440]  Right.
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:31.440]  Right.
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:32.440]  Yeah.
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:33.440]  I mean, it's unlikely.
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:35.560]  I mean, Jim Kramer is a, you know, he's not a journalist really, but he's a guy who does,
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:38.320]  who talks about this stuff in a show.
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:44.600]  So I think talking to him, it seems like he's, the, the point is actually to get it out there.
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:46.160]  It's what's worse is when you call your buddy.
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:47.160]  Yeah.
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:48.160]  Yeah.
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:49.160]  Your friend.
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:50.160]  Yeah.
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:51.160]  Yeah.
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:55.640]  So obviously that's what it's meant to, to, to, to, that's what the law is in place for,
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:38:01.400]  but that there's people who've gotten in trouble for, didn't the Netflix CEO get in trouble
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:07.240]  for like a blog post where he posted stuff like, cause blog posts wasn't officially,
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:09.520]  or maybe like a tweet or something.
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:13.400]  Oh, you know, that sounds, that sounds vaguely familiar.
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:14.400]  Yeah.
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:19.840]  But why would a tweet not be, I forget what it was, but it, well, that somehow that it,
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:25.000]  it, there's certain forms reaching out, it wasn't considered public or something opt
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.520]  in to follow it, right?
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:31.280]  Like a press release that goes out on the official press wire, which is weird because
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:35.560]  it's actually, that's actually something that, you know, normal people don't access, but
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:37.200]  all of the media do.
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:41.480]  And it's assumed then that everybody has equal access to the media somehow that, you know,
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:42.720]  but that's okay.
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:49.320]  It's just that like tweets had never been, uh, um, okayed by the sec before and that
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:50.320]  they're respected.
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:53.000]  Well only, you know, certain people have access to Twitter because you have to have a cell
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.260]  phone and whatever.
[01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:57.240]  They just didn't get it.
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:58.240]  Yeah.
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:01.520]  So do you want to talk about the Apple TV?
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:06.320]  Uh, I do, but I should take a break here and thank another one of our, uh, our friends
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:12.520]  and this time it is our good friend, um, automatic.
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:17.200]  These are the guys who make that the connected car adapter, it's a little dongle.
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:22.120]  I love saying that word, um, and it plugs into your car's diagnostic port.
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:26.240]  Uh, I think it's like every car since like 1997, but it's somewhere around there.
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:30.400]  It's like every car of recent vintage has one of these ports and it's a standard port,
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:31.760]  which is really kind of cool.
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:36.520]  Um, you know, like the way that like USB is a standard port and HDMI is a standard port
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:40.400]  where there's a car diagnostic port, it's like underneath the dashboard somewhere on
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:41.400]  your car.
[01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:46.800]  Um, and that's when you go to, uh, like your dealer or to the mechanic, you know, and like
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:50.080]  when your car has like a thing that lights up and says like, uh, you need, you're due
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:55.500]  for service a two, uh, you go in there, they, that's what they plug their stuff into.
[01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:58.720]  And then it tells them, you know, what it's saying that, you know, your oil filter needs
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:00.360]  replacement or whatever.
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:02.440]  Well, you can access that too.
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:04.200]  That's, you know, and that's what automatic is for.
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:05.440]  It's this really cool thing.
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:10.540]  You just plug it in to that diagnostic port and then it uses Bluetooth to cut, you know,
[01:40:10.540 --> 01:40:13.280]  talk to, uh, their app, which is on your iPhone.
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:17.640]  Um, and it just tells you, so if you ever get one of those weird things like service,
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:22.280]  you know, a five or I don't even know what the things are, uh, and you're worried like
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:23.280]  what the hell does that mean?
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:26.240]  Is that, you know, routine is, is my car ready to break it?
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:29.360]  Automatic will explain to you in plain English exactly what's going on.
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:32.540]  And it even lets you clear the light if, if you want to, so you don't have to get annoyed
[01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:33.540]  by that.
[01:40:33.540 --> 01:40:37.840]  Every time you start the car up really cool, uh, gives you a log of your trips.
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:43.320]  Uh, it uses, uh, the GPS on your phone so that when, uh, you get out of your car, it
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:45.440]  will remember where you were parked.
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:47.280]  Uh, it's like anything.
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:49.720]  It just turns your car into a smart car.
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:50.720]  Really, really cool.
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:53.880]  Uh, even it can even score you on your driving.
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:58.800]  Uh, so if you're like me and you have a lead foot, it'll just tell you, boy, you, you know,
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:00.360]  you driving too fast, John.
[01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:01.760]  I mean, that's really what it'll do.
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:05.320]  Uh, you can tell you how, what kind of mileage you're getting tells you if you drive in a
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:11.280]  style that's, uh, you know, getting you good mileage, uh, just amazingly cool stuff though.
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:12.640]  So they've added a new thing.
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:14.520]  They're calling it the app store for your car.
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:18.560]  Um, and there's over 20 apps that are available within, uh, their thing.
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:22.660]  And it allows you to use your car's data in all kinds of ways so you can hook it up to
[01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:27.360]  nest so that your thermostat, I mean, this is like, seriously, it's like science fiction
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:28.360]  stuff.
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:31.780]  You can have your air conditioning turn on when you get within, you know, five miles
[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:33.400]  of your house or whatever you want.
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:38.640]  Uh, amazing stuff like that if you have nest, uh, if this, then that integration with all
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:44.200]  sorts of ways to, to let you do stuff based automatically on this smart information coming
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:47.400]  out of your car, just really great, really fun.
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:50.640]  It seems like something that ought to be built into your cars, but it's actually kind of
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:52.080]  cool that you can do it with automatic.
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:56.640]  It's a standard port, so you don't have to like depend on like your car maker, making
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:57.740]  an app for your phone.
[01:41:57.740 --> 01:41:59.600]  You just use automatics and it's really good.
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:00.600]  These guys know what they're doing.
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:03.840]  They have really good design and everything like that.
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:06.120]  Sounds too good to be true almost, but it's, it's great.
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:07.120]  I think it's really cool.
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:12.920]  You can check out the apps at a automatic.com slash apps and you want to buy it.
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:14.060]  Here's the thing.
[01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:22.320]  It's just a hundred bucks, $99.95, but you get 20% off by using this URL, automatic.com
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:30.200]  slash the talk show that these guys have their act together and gave me the code right there
[01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:32.160]  slash the talk show.
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:33.860]  You save 20% off.
[01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:36.560]  That's 20 bucks, so you get this thing for 80 bucks.
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:40.240]  It ships in two days and they have a 45 day return policy.
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:44.760]  So 45 days later, 44 days later, you'd say this thing's, you know, I don't like it.
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:45.760]  It's nonsense.
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:46.760]  You just send it back.
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:47.760]  You get your money back.
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:49.720]  Nobody's going to do that because it's cool once you have it in there.
[01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:55.760]  I mean your car is like, it's like you've got kit well except for the power boost thing.
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:58.240]  It doesn't, it doesn't give you that.
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:01.440]  So anyway, go to automatic.com slash the talk show.

[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:12.720]  So what else?
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:15.760]  Do you think there's going to be a Apple TV tomorrow?
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:16.760]  Not tomorrow.
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:19.520]  Tuesday, Wednesday, Wednesday.
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:22.760]  I sure sure hope so.
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:27.200]  It's been five years.
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:28.200]  Is that right?
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:29.200]  Remember that correctly?
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:37.400]  I think that the one that the, I think the third, the third generation is later or is
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:39.920]  it just five years in that form factor maybe?
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:40.920]  Yeah.
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:42.680]  But what did the third one add?
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:45.800]  I know that it has faster and more memory, right?
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:46.800]  Yeah.
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:53.240]  And the second one, it's, um, it's, what is it, 10 80, 10 80 P instead of seven 20.
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:54.240]  Yeah.
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:56.160]  Did, what's the old one?
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:43:57.200]  Only seven 20.
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:58.200]  I think so.
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:02.240]  Oh, well that, that, that's kind of gross.
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:03.240]  That's what I have.
[01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:04.240]  Yeah.
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:09.920]  Well, I, well, no, it's funny as I have the new Apple TV, but I have a seven 20 P TV set,
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:10.920]  which I don't mind at all.
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:11.920]  I've got seven.
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:12.920]  I've got seven 20 eyes.
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:15.480]  Oh, by the way, don't everybody out there.
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:24.160]  Don't tell my son that our TV is seven 20 just in case you ever see the thing is, is
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:29.720]  I have a really, I have, I, it's probably one of the most beloved possessions I have
[01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:36.520]  is a pioneer plasma TV and I got seven 20 instead of 10 80.
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:37.520]  I don't know what I bought.
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:42.600]  I think I bought it in like 2006 it's, it's old really, but I still love it cause I love
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:43.600]  plasma.
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:45.960]  I love the color of plasma.
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:46.960]  And I did the math.
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:51.080]  I, there's like a calculator where you can, I got like a tape measure and measured where
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:55.120]  I sit and where our TV is in our house and there's nowhere else.
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:56.600]  There's no way to like rearrange our TV.
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:00.060]  It's like we've got one place where we can put a TV on our living room.
[01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:05.080]  And we were well within the range of you.
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:09.080]  You will not see the difference, you know, between seven 20 and 10 80 so I just saved
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:13.440]  the money and got the seven 20 but it seems gross.
[01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:18.840]  What seems gross to me is having an Apple TV that can't do 10 80 just the, just the
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:19.840]  thought of it.
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:23.520]  Well not gross, gross is a little long, but it just seems, it just seems like antiquated,
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:24.520]  right?
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:25.520]  I mean 10 80.
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:27.080]  Well they were a year apart.
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:32.200]  So the, the most recent one was introduced in March of 2012 and the prior one was March
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:33.200]  of 2011.
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:34.700]  So it's not that far.
[01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:39.560]  And I know I still have the old, my second one upstairs on a TV that we almost never
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:43.240]  will watch, but it's, it doesn't have the new software update.
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:44.240]  It still has the old.
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:45.240]  It doesn't.
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:46.240]  Yeah.
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:47.240]  Well it doesn't take it.
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:48.240]  Yeah.
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:49.240]  Right.
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:52.600]  It doesn't take it until the, the old interface and I had actually never even seen the new
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:56.040]  one, at least not in use until I went over to Alperts the other night.
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:57.040]  So Oh yeah.
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:00.160]  Cause he, of course he's got the latest and greatest.
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:01.160]  Yeah, sure.
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:07.920]  You know, I think this is, I'm really excited about this for the, because dying for one
[01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:08.920]  of these forever.
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:09.920]  Okay.
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:14.960]  So we know that there's a new Apple TV and we know that they're going to do, well, we
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:15.960]  don't know.
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:19.120]  No, but everybody says there's going to be an app store for it and a full SDK.
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:22.800]  And, and there's rumors about a new controller and we know a little bit about the controller
[01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:29.980]  supposedly that it's like a touch pad, like I guess like a max got some physical buttons
[01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:34.280]  and also like a, like a touch, some sort of touch, like a track pad.
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:41.320]  Um, so it, you know, and, and by all the reports that I've seen, I know a lot of people for
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:46.080]  so long have said, whenever we speculate on a new Apple TVs and I've always been going
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:50.740]  on and on and they got to get rid of this piece of shit remote, they've got to do something
[01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:52.760]  about this goddamn remote.
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:57.440]  And everybody always says to me, I, I know what the new, the next Apple TV remote is.
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:58.840]  It's going to be your iPhone.
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:01.000]  You just use your iPhone as the remote.
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.120]  And to me, that's, that's like a, that's a nonstarter.
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:08.120]  You already can use that remote app, which I don't like.
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:09.120]  I know some people do.
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:13.320]  I just don't, I never ever use that other than when like, if I have to like enter a
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:18.520]  password, but usually when I have to enter a password, it's, uh, the wifi password and
[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:22.000]  you can't enter the wifi password if, or I guess you can now.
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.880]  I think they might've done something or no, it's a keyboard.
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:29.640]  You can do like a hookup, a physical Bluetooth keyboard to it, which is actually a cool,
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:32.660]  a cool, uh, that's actually a cool thing if you know about it.
[01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:36.160]  So if you're setting up a new Apple, the old Apple, don't buy a new Apple TV right now,
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:40.160]  by the way, you should run on by one right now, just to see what the first run experience
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:44.200]  is like, you can hook up a Bluetooth, your, your Apple Bluetooth keyboard, or I guess
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:48.240]  any Bluetooth keyboard to it, and then enter your wifi password that way, which is a hell
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:53.240]  of a lot easier than the up, down, left, right, select nonsense.
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:57.200]  Um, uh, so I, iPhone is an Apple TV remote.
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:47:59.760]  I mean, maybe they'll still have an app for it or whatever, but it's no good.
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:03.060]  You cannot sell a thing and then tell people that you have to, you got to run out and buy
[01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:09.520]  an iPod or $600 iPhone and then have one that's in the living room at all times.
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:10.520]  Right.
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:17.960]  So like, even if like, uh, uh, a family, the, the, uh, two parents and they both have iPhones,
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:22.480]  uh, they can't say that you have to have one of those iPhones in front of the TV.
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:27.040]  So if a kid wants to watch TV, you know, one of the parents has to give up their iPhone.
[01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:28.040]  It's crazy.
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:32.920]  And you know, Oh, well just buy your kid a $200 iPod touch.
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:36.760]  You can't sell a $200 remote control to $150 box.
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:40.400]  You know, well, the one reason, I mean, other than the keypad part, the one thing that I
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:47.000]  like about the remote app is that the remote is always in my pocket or on my wrist now.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:53.960]  Um, whereas, you know, you try and find one of those, those little things, it's a pain
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:54.960]  in the ass.
[01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:55.960]  Yeah.
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:58.680]  So like, you know, like my kid will just, you know, he turned something on, he just
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:02.360]  sits it on the couch and then, and then, you know, five minutes later, it's stuck in the
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:03.360]  cushions someplace.
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:04.360]  Yeah.
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:09.400]  Um, Hey, does, does, uh, does your kid sit real close to the TV when he plays video games?
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:10.400]  Oh, sure.
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:11.400]  Yeah.
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:17.560]  So that's why I don't want Jonas to know it's seven 20 because he's a he's young and he's
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:21.840]  so he's got, still got great eyes, uh, who knows for how long, given how close he sits
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:23.840]  to the TV.
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:30.600]  Uh, but he sits close enough that he's absolutely positively within the range where he would
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:34.040]  be able to see the difference between seven 20 and 10 eight.
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:35.040]  Yeah.
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:39.000]  And I just keep waiting for him to notice, I guess he's got to go over to the other kids'
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.720]  houses and see, right.
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:46.120]  And I don't think I'm going to be able to sell him on the advantages of plasma versus,
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:51.620]  uh, you know, plasma seven, two, I really firmly, truly a hundred percent.
[01:49:51.620 --> 01:49:57.320]  My heart believed that I like a seven 20 P, uh, plasma.
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:50:01.560]  And the fact that I sit far enough away always that I, I know that I wouldn't see the difference.
[01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:04.520]  I mean, you know, my one, I just screwed up anyway.
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:08.040]  So there's no way I would see the difference, but I know that he would cause he sits so
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:09.040]  damn close.
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:12.960]  So when we, when me and you were kids, I guess I remember sitting close to the TV to play
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:16.720]  Atari and my parents would yell at me every time and make me move back.
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:20.080]  And they'd say, you're going to, you know, you're going to wreck your eyes.
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:24.260]  And I remember this is one of those things where I filed this away in my head as they
[01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:25.260]  don't know anything.
[01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:26.260]  They don't know this.
[01:50:26.260 --> 01:50:30.760]  They're not optometrists, you know, they don't show me the evidence that, that sitting close,
[01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:34.160]  you know, I sit close to a book when I read it, why can't I sit close to the TV?
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:38.440]  So I filed it away in my head that when I'm a parent, I'm not going to do that.
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:39.600]  And I've stuck to that.
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:44.440]  I don't, I, I will sometimes question him and I'll say, are you sure you want to sit
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:45.440]  that close?
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:49.460]  And he says, well, I, I started doing that simply because that's what I had heard.
[01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:53.480]  And then I thought, wait a minute, this is not, I mean, first of all, these, you know,
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:58.080]  sitting close to a cathode Ray tube, I think is a little different than sitting close.
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:03.960]  Like there's, there's nothing, there's not like some radiation coming out of that thing.
[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:06.760]  It's a flat, you know, it's just like liquid crystal.
[01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:07.760]  It's not, I'm worried.
[01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:08.760]  I'm worried.
[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:11.120]  I'm going to Google this after the show and it's going to say like, yeah, sitting close
[01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:14.320]  to a cathode Ray tube is shown.
[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:20.800]  It specifically leads to retinal detachments later in life and like, holy shit, that's
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:21.800]  my fault.
[01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:27.840]  And stabbing yourself in the hand, stabbing yourself in the hand, uh, falling down the
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:28.840]  stairs.
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:29.840]  Holy shit.
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:30.840]  That is my kid.
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:31.840]  Sit close to the TV when he plays.
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:33.680]  Well, Hank's, Hank's eyesight's not great.
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:39.040]  So he sits, he often sits close to the TV, um, and, and, you know, and whatever he's
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:40.040]  playing.
[01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:41.040]  Yeah.
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:48.080]  So, but you put his glasses on him and he can back up like foot that has nothing to
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:50.840]  do with like, uh, needing to sit close.
[01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:51.840]  He just likes it.
[01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:52.840]  So I don't know.
[01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:53.840]  Well, that's why.
[01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:54.840]  Yeah.
[01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:55.840]  I mean, I think that's why I always did too.
[01:51:55.840 --> 01:51:56.840]  Yeah.
[01:51:56.840 --> 01:51:59.120]  Well, it fills your, fills your field of vision, you know?
[01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:00.120]  Right.
[01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:01.120]  Right.
[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:02.120]  You want to immerse yourself in that experience.
[01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:03.120]  Right.
[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:05.520]  It's effectively, you have a bigger display that way, especially I think, yeah.
[01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:08.640]  And especially like with games, which are experienced, it's, you know,
[01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:09.640]  Yeah.
[01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:10.640]  Well, this is what just funny.
[01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:13.680]  Cause I, now I see it with the way that our living room is arranged.
[01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:18.960]  The couch really, you know, this has to be a certain distance away from the television
[01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:25.800]  and I've sat on the couch and held my iPad up and my iPad is closer, you know, his field
[01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:30.000]  fills more, a larger area than the TV and the TV is not small.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.000]  It's 42 inches.
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.560]  It's not huge either, but it's, but it's, it's pretty big.
[01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:35.560]  Yeah.
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:40.840]  And yet if I, if I have my iPad, it's actually a better option.
[01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:41.840]  Hmm.
[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:42.840]  Interesting.
[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:47.560]  Um, but I'll have a new T I'll have a new Apple TV sometime soon.
[01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:48.560]  Yeah.
[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:52.800]  Um, but anyway, new remote for the Apple TV.
[01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:59.800]  Uh, but nobody really knows anything about what this is going to be like, which is super
[01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:01.080]  cool to me.
[01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:07.000]  Like, you know, what is the basic gist of the, uh, like in my opinion, we don't really
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.240]  know much more than we knew that, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:10.880]  Apple's going to make a phone.
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:14.560]  I guess we know a little more because we know that this remote is supposedly like a little
[01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:17.920]  touch pad and we didn't even know the iPhone had a touch screen, right.
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:22.720]  Um, you know, before the iPhone came out, but it's, it's close to that level of who
[01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:26.320]  knows what they're going to do and what the interface is going to be like.
[01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:27.320]  Right.
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:30.360]  It's, uh, I don't know, I'm, I'm really excited.
[01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:34.720]  I really hoping that they've, they've got like a big wow in store.
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:35.720]  Yeah.
[01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:37.160]  And I wrote about this, I wrote about this last week.
[01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:41.080]  I think the stakes are higher for them with this than with the watch.
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:46.600]  I think that the watch, I think this needs that they need to do a better job with this
[01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:51.520]  than they did with the watch and that the stakes are higher because if it's, if it's
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:56.360]  a mediocre product, I feel like they are, it's not going to do as well as they need
[01:53:56.360 --> 01:54:04.760]  it to do what, uh, and it's, it gets back to what I said, you know, a while ago on the
[01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:08.520]  show and we were talking about watches that the watch kind of, because it piggybacks on
[01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:09.520]  the phone.
[01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:13.080]  If you have an iPhone and you want to get a smartwatch, you're going to get an Apple
[01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:14.080]  watch.
[01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:15.840]  And so they've got like a home field advantage there.
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:20.880]  Whereas there's a little bit of that with the Apple TV, where if you're in the ecosystem,
[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:24.920]  if you already have an iTunes account, but everybody has an iTunes account, right?
[01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:29.280]  Every, I mean, who doesn't have, I guess kids, you know, teenagers who've never gotten into
[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:33.800]  buying music, but you know, anybody who's an adult as an iTunes account.
[01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:37.500]  Um, and if you've already bought a bunch of movies and TV shows, you know, there's some
[01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:40.520]  motivation there to, to get an Apple TV.
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:43.520]  But it's, to me, it's nowhere near as tied to that.
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:47.600]  You know that if you own an iPhone, even if you own an iPhone and an Apple watch and you
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:52.760]  have a Mac book, um, there's nothing stopping you from buying a rock, you or any of these
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:59.640]  other boxes, you know, whereas, um, and many, I mean, most of the most of the nerds that
[01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:02.120]  I know anyway, have multiple, multiple boxes.
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:03.120]  Yeah.
[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:07.880]  So, and I, but I kind of feel like the race is on to make the box, right?
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:13.120]  And it doesn't necessarily, even if you're a really staunch fan of Apple stuff, that
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:17.400]  doesn't mean it's going to be the Apple TV unless the Apple TV is great.
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:19.600]  It has to be great for it to succeed.
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:20.600]  Yeah.
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:24.440]  That's the only, and that's exciting to me, you know, whereas I feel like with the watch,
[01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:27.840]  the watch didn't have to be great for it to succeed.
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:28.840]  Pretty good.
[01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:32.840]  It would, it would do if it, if it is pretty good, it'll do pretty good.
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:35.580]  Whereas I feel like with Apple TV, if it's only pretty good, it's not even going to do
[01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:37.480]  pretty good in terms of sales.
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:38.480]  Yeah.
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:40.900]  Like it really has to be great.
[01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:49.880]  So the one of the key other key features other than the remote is supposedly universal search,
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:54.880]  which has been problematic on that thing forever because it's like, you want to watch something,
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:56.840]  but you don't know where it's available.
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:55:57.840]  Right.
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:55:59.160]  You think, so you think they're going to do that?
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:02.680]  Well, that's one of the things that they're talking, I mean, that's, I hope so.
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:03.800]  I certainly hope so.
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:07.720]  And then, you know, and then tying Siri into that, you know, find me, that'll start electric
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:08.720]  or whatever.
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:09.720]  Right.
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:14.600]  I mean, six feet deep, something, you know, and Siri says, you can get it here or here
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:15.600]  or here.
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:16.600]  Yeah.
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:17.600]  Or it's streaming over here.
[01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:22.680]  I mean, you know, it seems like those guys, they have to tie into it.
[01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:27.040]  So I don't know, I mean, maybe it's a difficult sell because a lot of them don't necessarily
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:33.960]  want to be in that level of competition, you know, cause it really, it really kind of could,
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:39.440]  can screw you if your deal isn't quite as good as somebody else's.
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:43.880]  And the, and the, it seems like the apps need to hook into that.
[01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:45.240]  And I mean, well, yeah, I mean, that's obvious.
[01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:50.280]  The apps have to hook into that in order to be able to allow them to do that.
[01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:55.560]  I think though that most would, or at least like the, enough of the big ones would right.
[01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:58.400]  The ones who are already partners with Apple.
[01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:04.760]  So for example, that's just Netflix, Hulu, HBO, just to name a couple of them, right?
[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:11.160]  So, and again, Apple TV to date has been what I think that they thought they were going
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:15.080]  to, the, the, the no app store camp thought they would do with the iPhone, where they
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:18.680]  have these partners and there's, you know, now they're at this point, there's lots and
[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:23.560]  lots of channels or apps, whatever you want to call them on the current Apple TV.
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:25.680]  But they're all done in partnership, right?
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:30.640]  There's no way like, so, and so for example, the conspicuous absent is conspicuously absent
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:31.640]  is Amazon.
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:35.320]  So if you have Amazon prime, you need another box.
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:38.720]  You cannot, you know, there's no way to do it now.
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:43.080]  Whereas once this app store comes out, presumably Amazon will be able to write an Amazon app
[01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:44.080]  for the Apple TV.
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:49.280]  And even if Apple and Amazon never, you know, work out their own special deal, they'll just
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:53.760]  be in the app store in the same way that you can watch Amazon prime on your iPad.
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:58.920]  So is it your view that it's Apple controlling that rather than Amazon not wanting to be
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:00.200]  on the Apple TV?
[01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:01.760]  Oh, I, I think so.
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:02.760]  Yeah.
[01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:06.360]  I think that I'm guessing that Amazon would, but I think, I think that the way that the
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:09.320]  two companies don't like each other, you know, yeah.
[01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:12.120]  And I sort of thought it was the other way around that they, Amazon simply wanted you
[01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:16.360]  to go out and buy a fire stick, but I don't think so because boy, you can get Amazon and
[01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:17.680]  just about every other box.
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:22.640]  If you look, if you it's, I'm not sure that you can even find a box that doesn't have
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:23.640]  Amazon.
[01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:24.640]  Yeah.
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:25.640]  Cause we talked about it.
[01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:26.960]  We talked about this on the rebound and Dan pointed that out to me too.
[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:30.600]  And so I was thinking, yeah, it's probably, it was probably wrong.
[01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:31.600]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:35.480]  I think it's Apple though, but it's certainly on enough that it's, it's there.
[01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:38.960]  Um, I think we have it on our TiVo and it's really weird.
[01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:43.440]  Oh, it's, I don't know what the hell kind of crap you write these apps on for TiVo.
[01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:47.240]  Like when you, when you switch to the, oh, we have a really new TiVo too.
[01:58:47.240 --> 01:58:53.440]  It's it's like the top of the line jobby, uh, uh, when you launch the Amazon thing,
[01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:59.520]  it's like the screen like zaps out, you know, like almost like the TV went off.
[01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:06.780]  Like, and I don't know, it just feels like it was, uh, I might even be, I might not even
[01:59:06.780 --> 01:59:10.040]  be making this up that it's like written in like shockwave or something like that.
[01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:11.480]  It really feels like it.
[01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:16.640]  And it's not, it's not high def it's, it's a standard death picture.
[01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:17.640]  So bad.
[01:59:17.640 --> 01:59:21.760]  Um, anyway though, I don't think Apple would have a hard time at all, at least with like
[01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:30.280]  people who they would want to promote on stage, like Netflix and Hulu and, and, uh, HBO, um,
[01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:32.800]  to get them to, to open up the search.
[01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:33.800]  Right.
[01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:35.440]  Why wouldn't you want, why wouldn't Netflix want that?
[01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:39.280]  I mean, I mean, there's certainly, there's certainly no reason Netflix wouldn't want
[01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:40.280]  it.
[01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:41.280]  That's for sure.
[01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:42.280]  Yeah.
[01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:43.280]  Yeah.
[01:59:43.280 --> 01:59:44.280]  Cause everything is free.
[01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:45.280]  Right.
[01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:46.280]  It's no, no additional cost anyway.
[01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:50.160]  Uh, it's just, I would, you know, I mean, maybe, you know, like Amazon, like if it's,
[01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:53.320]  if it's the difference between, although Amazon probably sells all that stuff for less than
[01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:54.320]  Apple does.
[01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:55.320]  Yeah.
[01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:56.320]  It seems so.
[01:59:56.320 --> 01:59:57.320]  The universal search thing.
[01:59:57.320 --> 02:00:00.760]  I know I've, I've been, I know he's talked about it in one of the shows he's on a million
[02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:05.880]  times, but like it just, every time it happens to me, I always think of Merlin, uh, Merlin
[02:00:05.880 --> 02:00:06.880]  man.
[02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:09.880]  Cause I just know it's the sort of thing that just drives Merlin crazy.
[02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:13.080]  You know, like, so let's say you sit down with your family and you're going to, you've
[02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:18.400]  agreed to watch a caddy shack or whatever, pick a family, you know, good family movie
[02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:20.980]  like that.
[02:00:20.980 --> 02:00:25.380]  And you search for caddy shack, but you have to search and you were like, well, let's watch
[02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:29.420]  it for free and Netflix and you go to Netflix and it ends up Netflix doesn't have caddy
[02:00:29.420 --> 02:00:34.860]  shack, but you've just been, and you sat there typing it in on, on the remote, right?
[02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:39.440]  This ridiculous little up, down, left, right remote that is not even using Bluetooth.
[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:42.800]  You have to point the goddamn infrared ray at the thing.
[02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:46.880]  And then you get all the way then do this and it ends up, they don't have caddy shack
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:51.600]  and then you go back and you go and then they have to end it to start the search again in
[02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:56.200]  the, you know, the iTunes store to get it from iTunes, you have to type it all over
[02:00:56.200 --> 02:00:57.200]  again.
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:02.320]  It doesn't even, you know, there's not like a universal search memory or something like
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:03.320]  that.
[02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:06.880]  So the idea that you could just say, find me caddy shack and it'll show you all of your
[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:11.760]  options, you know, for how to watch caddy shack right now, including just hit here and
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:16.520]  you can start streaming it for free on Netflix would be fantastic, right?
[02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:18.440]  In fact, I almost feel like it has to do that.
[02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:21.320]  Like if it doesn't do that, I think that, I think if it doesn't do that, it's going
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:22.320]  to be kind of a disappointment.
[02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:26.880]  I know that the, I mean the, the Amazon device does that to a certain degree, but I think
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:30.160]  it kind of prioritizes Amazon's offering.
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:34.000]  So like if it's like, if it's free someplace else, their stuff still shows up like, Hey,
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:35.000]  you can get it here.
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:36.000]  Yeah.
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:37.000]  I wouldn't be surprised if Apple's does that too.
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:42.160]  If you know, maybe iTunes offering is first, but yeah, I mean, yeah, I don't know.
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:43.160]  I'll hit down.
[02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:46.080]  I'll swipe down a couple of times to watch it for free.
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:47.080]  Sure.
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:55.040]  Uh, I, I, I, and I feel like in, in general, you know, because it's been so long since
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:59.920]  they've had a serious update to Apple TV, I feel like we're actually being reasonable
[02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:02.280]  by demanding a lot of this.
[02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:03.280]  Yes.
[02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:05.480]  I completely, I completely agree.
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:10.200]  Like in general, I tried to be reasonable in my expectations, you know, and, and you
[02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:14.480]  know, the whole idea that, uh, you know, famously, you know, it's, you're going to have, we're
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:22.160]  going to see at least 50 articles by the end of the week that say, um, there's not enough
[02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:28.840]  in the iPhone six S to make, make people upgrade from save Apple, right?
[02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:29.840]  Not enough.
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:32.040]  There's not enough reasons to upgrade from last year's iPhone.
[02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:33.440]  Therefore it's a failure.
[02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:37.040]  Whereas the whole point is normal people don't upgrade, they don't buy a new phone every
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:38.280]  year.
[02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:43.080]  You know, I feel though that, you know, with the Apple TV, it really does have to be enough
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:46.600]  that it makes everybody who already has an Apple TV want to upgrade.
[02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:47.600]  Yeah.
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:48.600]  Yeah.
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:55.720]  It's, I mean, so it's been three and a half years since the most recent one.
[02:02:55.720 --> 02:02:58.960]  And that was only like a kind of a bump from the previous one.
[02:02:58.960 --> 02:02:59.960]  Yeah.
[02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:03.240]  It's just a, so it's, yeah, really, you know, the picture, the picture is nicer too, but
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:04.240]  yeah.
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:05.800]  And other than that, right.
[02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:06.800]  It's not that much.
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:11.040]  It's the same basic concept and infrared remote that goes up, down, left, right.
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:16.320]  Play, pause, and, and that you just sit there and move up, down, left, move a selection
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:18.960]  up, down, left, right around the screen full of apps.
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:22.520]  And then when you go in there, it's this, this, you know, same thing.
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:23.520]  Yeah.
[02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:25.760]  Got to be able to, they got to do something new.
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:27.200]  I think they're going to pull it off.
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:31.340]  That's the, this is the other interesting thing to me is that I've detected an awful
[02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:41.000]  lot of, um, I guess pessimism or almost like, uh, uh, like we've been so disappointed
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:44.600]  and limited by what Apple TV is for so long that there's an awful lot of people who it
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:48.920]  seems to me don't, don't really have high expectations for this.
[02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:49.920]  I don't know.
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:50.920]  I could be wrong about that.
[02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:54.280]  I don't know if you've noticed that, that there's an awful lot of people who, you know,
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:59.920]  really think that, you know, this is going to be, um, you know, they just don't think
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:02.600]  Apple TV is ever going to be good because it hasn't been good.
[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:03.600]  Yeah.
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:09.060]  Well, I think one of the big concerns was that it seems like they, the hard part is
[02:04:09.060 --> 02:04:14.040]  striking the deals and a lot of people were also just expecting Apple to come up with
[02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:18.360]  their own streaming service, their own television streaming server.
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:19.360]  Yeah.
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:20.360]  Yeah.
[02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:21.360]  Television, media, whatever.
[02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:26.760]  I mean, still along the lines of Netflix, I guess, and that that would be a key feature
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:31.740]  of it and that if they were able to do it, they would have done it a long time ago and
[02:04:31.740 --> 02:04:32.740]  they haven't done it.
[02:04:32.740 --> 02:04:33.900]  So that means that they're not able to do it.
[02:04:33.900 --> 02:04:35.400]  So it's not going to happen.
[02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:39.880]  Um, I don't feel like that that's, I mean, I think that would be nice if they were able
[02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:43.040]  to do something that's better, but I still think that they could introduce a device that's
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:45.120]  really good without having to do that.
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:53.520]  I mean, if it has that global search functionality, I, I think that would work almost as well.
[02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:54.960]  I think they need to do that.
[02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:59.480]  I think though, at a fundamental level, what they, what I really think they need to do,
[02:04:59.480 --> 02:05:04.260]  I really think that they need to do it and I really hope that they have is they really
[02:05:04.260 --> 02:05:12.640]  need to make the basic interaction with a TV awesome that you are actually feel like
[02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:17.520]  you're having fun just by like choosing which thing to pick, right?
[02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:23.640]  Cause that's really what fundamentally what they did with the iPhone where cell phones
[02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:28.820]  were always these things that were really junky and they had buttons that were like
[02:05:28.820 --> 02:05:34.380]  just didn't feel good and, and these weird little Java applets that they called games
[02:05:34.380 --> 02:05:40.400]  that were always super high in latency and you know, you know, the type of games that
[02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:45.040]  like adults play, you know, like just to waste two minutes, like it would never ever interest
[02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:46.040]  a kid, right?
[02:05:46.040 --> 02:05:51.960]  Who had like a Nintendo, like a game boy, like in the way that like game boys have always
[02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:58.520]  been right since the first one really responsive, fun, top-notch little gadgets.
[02:05:58.520 --> 02:05:59.800]  People did that to the phone.
[02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:04.400]  They took this thing that was across the board, no matter which brand you bought, it was a
[02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:09.860]  crap experience and brought it all the way forward to this is an awesome experience and
[02:06:09.860 --> 02:06:15.200]  there's no latency and the screen, you know, it, it scrolls exactly one to one with your
[02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:18.720]  fingers as you touch and when you touch something, you don't have to wait for it to respond.
[02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:21.560]  It responds a second, you know, just like a physical item.
[02:06:21.560 --> 02:06:24.720]  They need to make the TV like that so that when you're sitting there moving your thumb
[02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:29.140]  around the remote or whatever you're going to do, that it's just fun.
[02:06:29.140 --> 02:06:34.020]  Like it just feels fun just to interact with your TV and that, you know, and, and like
[02:06:34.020 --> 02:06:37.180]  a perfect Bluetooth connection from the remote to the TV.
[02:06:37.180 --> 02:06:41.320]  So there's never any latency and you're never like moving your finger around and nothing
[02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:44.340]  is happening.
[02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:48.760]  And when you select something that needs to launch right away and you're right in there
[02:06:48.760 --> 02:06:54.760]  and it's, you know, like, like the iPhone cause so much of what frustrates me with the
[02:06:54.760 --> 02:06:59.320]  every everything really, I mean everything I've ever hooked up to my TV is just the stuff
[02:06:59.320 --> 02:07:04.680]  never seems to respond fast enough.
[02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:10.720]  The best device I have is a TiVo by far just in general, just because the newest one does
[02:07:10.720 --> 02:07:13.040]  have a Bluetooth remote, not infrared.
[02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:18.420]  It is pretty good and the latency isn't that bad and I don't think the latency is between
[02:07:18.420 --> 02:07:22.720]  the remote and the TiVo, I think it's just that the TiVo itself has always had sort of
[02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:27.080]  a notoriously slow interface.
[02:07:27.080 --> 02:07:30.720]  And this is a thing I know Syracuse has gone on and on about this and I share it and I
[02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:35.800]  feel like I wouldn't even have the longing in my heart if I didn't own a TiVo forever.
[02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:41.040]  The one thing TiVo has always done really, really well, I mean going back to like my
[02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:47.800]  first one in like 1999 or 2000 is that when you're playing video, you can fast forward
[02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:51.160]  and rewind and it's perfect.
[02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:53.240]  In fact, it's almost like they're too smart.
[02:07:53.240 --> 02:07:58.720]  I find that like they do like when you fast forward through commercials and you see the
[02:07:58.720 --> 02:08:04.000]  show and you hit play, it goes back a little bit because you know that's when you've hit
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.360]  play is when you've seen that the show's back on.
[02:08:06.360 --> 02:08:16.560]  They go back too far, like my reactions, you know my, what do you call it?
[02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:17.560]  Motor skills, I don't know.
[02:08:17.560 --> 02:08:18.560]  I'm quick enough.
[02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:19.560]  I'm quick enough.
[02:08:19.560 --> 02:08:20.560]  Hand-eye coordination?
[02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:21.560]  Reaction time?
[02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:22.560]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:25.760]  My reaction time is fast enough that they actually help me too much and then I see the
[02:08:25.760 --> 02:08:29.160]  last 10 seconds of the commercial I just skipped.
[02:08:29.160 --> 02:08:34.920]  But the fast forwarding video on Apple TV and rewinding is garbage.
[02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:40.760]  It is so bad and in some cases, like with the streaming stuff, it doesn't even show
[02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:41.760]  it to you.
[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:42.760]  It just goes black.
[02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:43.760]  Right, right.
[02:08:43.760 --> 02:08:46.920]  Because it's got to buffer all that stuff before it can do that and if you're going
[02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:50.200]  far enough, you're going to go past the buffer.
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:51.200]  Right.
[02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:55.960]  So I feel like I really want, somebody's going to do it eventually and it's the sort of thing
[02:08:55.960 --> 02:09:00.360]  that Apple cares about so I hope it's, you know, I hope it's Apple and I hope it's coming
[02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:05.920]  this week is that to get it so that, you know, fast forwarding and rewinding video is as
[02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:11.240]  good as it can be or closer, you know, at least it's more like that first iPhone and
[02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:16.280]  the first iPhone, you know, by today's standards actually wasn't low latency and now it feels
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:17.280]  like it's laggy.
[02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:18.280]  Yeah.
[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:21.080]  But at the time, it was a revelation.
[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:25.600]  So at least I would, I demand it.
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:29.040]  I will call for Tim Cook's resignation if I don't get it.
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:34.080]  I want to be able to fast forward and rewind video and have it feel like it's a good experience.
[02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:37.880]  You're throwing that in kind of late.
[02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:39.800]  He's got to get that done by Wednesday.
[02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:41.720]  I don't think that's going to happen.
[02:09:41.720 --> 02:09:43.880]  That would be funny.
[02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:47.160]  I mean, one of the things, one of the things which I find kind of odd about these rumors
[02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:52.040]  is that some are saying that there are going to be two, they're going to have two different
[02:09:52.040 --> 02:09:54.120]  memory sizes.
[02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:58.320]  Like there's like an eight gigabyte and a 16 gigabyte, which I, I, I don't believe that
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:04.280]  because I don't think they're going to be able to make people understand why.
[02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:07.080]  And it just seems like a weird thing to do for those devices.
[02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:11.040]  And I feel like the smart thing to do would be, well, you know, they don't do this with
[02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:16.800]  the phones, but the, to do the 16 gigabyte and don't just don't, well, give the, do the
[02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:17.800]  16 gigabyte.
[02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:20.960]  And if you want to charge more, charge more, don't screw around with an eight gigabyte
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:21.960]  one.
[02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:22.960]  If that's, if you're going to have two.
[02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:23.960]  Yeah.
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:26.500]  And rather than have two tiers, just get the, just do the bigger one.
[02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:33.580]  And I know that most video and for some services, all of it, really most of it that it's streaming
[02:10:33.580 --> 02:10:39.620]  is the thing now rather than downloads, right?
[02:10:39.620 --> 02:10:45.780]  But it, if you're going to have games at all, I mean, games take up space and I know it's
[02:10:45.780 --> 02:10:49.880]  not going to be like a PS four or an Xbox type gaming thing.
[02:10:49.880 --> 02:10:53.880]  You know, it's, we already know it's got like an a eight, I mean, that's just common sense.
[02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:57.120]  You don't even have to read the rumor sites to know it's going to have like an a system
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:10:58.120]  on a chip.
[02:10:58.120 --> 02:11:01.000]  And so we know that basically the, you know, the capabilities of that, it's not going to
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:04.560]  be like a graphics powerhouse, but that's the reason that it couldn't have good games,
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:09.920]  you know, like, uh, like good Nintendo style games, right?
[02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:10.920]  Casual.
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:11.920]  Yeah.
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:18.720]  Um, I just can't see why they would, why they would cheap out on eight versus 16 if you
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:19.880]  could easily fill it up.
[02:11:19.880 --> 02:11:20.880]  Right.
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:21.880]  Yeah.
[02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:26.200]  I also think it's just confusing to offer two different sizes and yeah, I think so too.
[02:11:26.200 --> 02:11:29.680]  I think that, I mean, I know people understand that, you know, you gotta, you know, you want
[02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:34.400]  to download a lot of apps, you gotta get a bigger phone, but I don't think, yeah, Mark
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:35.400]  no marketing wise.
[02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:41.600]  It seems so much easier to just say, buy the, the new apple TV, $149.
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:42.600]  That's it.
[02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:43.600]  That's it.
[02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:46.640]  Your choice is to get a new apple TV or not get one and be a loser.
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:56.540]  And that's it like, like just that one level of do you want to eight or 16 gigabytes instantly
[02:11:56.540 --> 02:11:59.840]  makes the decision to buy so much more complicated.
[02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:03.920]  And I really do think that they know, I think apple knows that that complication results
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:06.840]  in some people saying, I don't know what to get, so I'm not going to get one.
[02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:07.840]  Yeah.
[02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:13.120]  And I really think that they would sell, I'm convinced that they would sell more boxes
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:19.920]  and make more money just by giving one with 16 gigabytes and to everybody than they would
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:24.080]  with two, you know, even if they could save some money on it, I really do.
[02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:27.000]  I think they would make more money cause I think that that complexity would just drive
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:28.000]  people nuts.
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  Right.
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.680]  And I, you know, I don't know, it just seems crazy.
[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:32.680]  Yeah.
[02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:38.320]  I wouldn't think that that would be, that doesn't sound like them, but I hope, at least
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:41.080]  I hope it's not, it's not that happens.
[02:12:41.080 --> 02:12:47.340]  I wonder though, with the games, I think about that though, with like just how limiting would
[02:12:47.340 --> 02:12:53.800]  even 16 gigabytes be, cause it seems like a lot of games are, you know, measure in the
[02:12:53.800 --> 02:13:00.440]  gigabytes already and you can't just, you can obviously, you know, delete an app and
[02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:05.640]  then redownload it later, but even with fast internet, it's like downloading a two gigabyte
[02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:09.120]  game again because you deleted it a couple of weeks ago, but now you're in the mood to
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:10.800]  play it again is a pain in the ass.
[02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:11.800]  Yeah.
[02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:18.120]  I think the Xbox was the, I think the sizes were like 32 gigabytes and then 200, something
[02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:19.120]  like that.
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:20.120]  Yeah.
[02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:24.200]  I mean, I think the difference was, was huge and it was kind of like, well, maybe you want
[02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:28.440]  to use it just for doing TV and maybe a couple of games.
[02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:30.640]  Or you're like a real serious gamer.
[02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:31.640]  Yeah.
[02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:37.200]  But you know, that's, that's twice as, or, you know, the smaller ones twice as much as.
[02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:45.240]  Do you think, do you think they're going to do like a, a home kit push with Apple TV?
[02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:46.960]  I don't know if they're ready for that yet.
[02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:52.400]  I mean, I think maybe it would get a mention and that it, it, I think that that's a long
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:53.480]  term plan.
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:54.480]  Right.
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:55.480]  But maybe not part of this week's announcement.
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:56.480]  Yeah.
[02:13:56.480 --> 02:13:57.480]  But maybe not part of this week's announcement.
[02:13:57.480 --> 02:13:58.480]  Yeah.
[02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:00.760]  Cause it seems like we're on a, we're on a kind of a slow build to that stuff.
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:04.480]  And I don't know that there, I mean, unless they they've worked something out with somebody
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:09.640]  else that, that there's really like a compelling thing where you're going to, you know, be
[02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:12.600]  standing up at your, at your chair to applaud.
[02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:18.320]  But I, I, I think that the basic idea and it makes sense to me, but the basic idea is
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:26.960]  that Apple, Apple TV could and ultimately should be like this always on, you know, even
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:32.340]  if it's in some low power mode, always on, always connected to the internet and always
[02:14:32.340 --> 02:14:38.200]  available from everywhere, sort of smart thing that's in your house so that you could do
[02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:42.480]  things, you know, like the nest type things like, you know, you know, somehow it would
[02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:46.720]  be like this thing that you could connect to and you know, have your lights turned on
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:51.200]  or have the air conditioning turn on, you know, at a certain schedule or stuff like
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:52.200]  that.
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:53.200]  I don't know.
[02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:55.760]  But I don't know that, I don't know that, that, that there's anything that they've got
[02:14:55.760 --> 02:15:00.800]  stuff and like you said, like an ecosystem in place to, to really make it a central part
[02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:01.800]  of this week's announcement.
[02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:02.800]  Yeah.
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:03.800]  Yeah.
[02:15:03.800 --> 02:15:10.020]  I mean, and there's some speculation about them making their own stuff, but we have certainly
[02:15:10.020 --> 02:15:11.780]  haven't heard any rumors of what that might be.
[02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:14.320]  So it doesn't seem like it would be coming.
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:15.320]  Right.
[02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:16.320]  Yeah.
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:17.320]  Let me take a break.
[02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:20.120]  I have one more sponsor thing and then we'll wrap up the show with our final thoughts about
[02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:24.600]  what else might be coming at the, coming at the show, but it's our good friends at back
[02:15:24.600 --> 02:15:25.600]  place.
[02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:28.200]  And honestly, I love all the sponsors of the show.
[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:29.360]  They're all great this week.
[02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:37.520]  If there's only one that I would say you, you have to use, it's gotta be backblaze because
[02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:39.280]  it's so important.
[02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:40.280]  What is it?
[02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:45.640]  It's online backup for the Mac.
[02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:50.240]  You download backblaze, you install it on your Mac and you just let it run.
[02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:53.360]  They've got a free trial, no risk, no credit card required.
[02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:56.280]  Just go there and sign up.
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:16:01.240]  And it just starts running and it just backs up everything on your Mac to their servers
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:04.080]  up in the cloud as they call it.
[02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:09.720]  You have external hard drives backs them up to how much, what's the limit, no limit, whatever
[02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:15.360]  you've got on your Mac, it gets backed up to backblaze and it's five bucks a month.
[02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:17.520]  That's it.
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:19.200]  It sounds too good to be true.
[02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:22.880]  That's I, I think if there are people out there who haven't tried backblaze, haven't
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:27.560]  used it, it's because this sounds unlimited backup for $5 a month.
[02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:29.840]  Sounds too good to be true.
[02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:30.840]  There's no catch.
[02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:32.680]  There is no catch.
[02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:35.400]  And the reason why is that hard drives are not that expensive.
[02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:39.120]  Like there's no, it sounds like, well, how can they stay in business?
[02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:42.860]  It's because hard drives are so, you know, cheap and they buy them in bulk and they do
[02:16:42.860 --> 02:16:46.720]  these cool things on their blog where like every year they have like a report of like
[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:49.560]  which brands of hard drives had the most failure and stuff like that.
[02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:54.360]  Like because they have so many hard drives in this massive amount of storage, what's
[02:16:54.360 --> 02:16:55.360]  the stat here?
[02:16:55.360 --> 02:17:00.680]  I got it in front of me, 150 petabytes of data backed up from their customers.
[02:17:00.680 --> 02:17:03.080]  That five bucks a month, it, you know, it works out.
[02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:05.200]  They're like a profitable, successful company.
[02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:09.920]  The only catch involved is that it really, it might take a long time for your initial
[02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:14.220]  backup depending, you know, you might say I have tons of data, I have terabytes of data.
[02:17:14.220 --> 02:17:20.000]  It might take a while for that depending on, you know, your, your relationship with Comcast.
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:21.160]  But that's it.
[02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:22.520]  They can't solve that problem.
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:24.960]  But once it's backed up, then everything else is incremental.
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:27.280]  The software is great.
[02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:29.020]  It's written by former Apple engineers.
[02:17:29.020 --> 02:17:30.200]  It's really good Mac software.
[02:17:30.200 --> 02:17:32.240]  You'll never notice it running on your computer.
[02:17:32.240 --> 02:17:36.360]  There's never any kind of like all of a sudden why is my fan on and you go check activity
[02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:38.440]  monitor and it's because backblaze is running.
[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:39.440]  That doesn't happen.
[02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:41.640]  It's great software.
[02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:44.960]  You'll never notice it and all of your stuff is backed up from anywhere.
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:48.880]  I cannot say how, how great a feeling it, what a relief that is knowing that everything
[02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:52.260]  on my, on my Mac is backed up outside my house somewhere.
[02:17:52.260 --> 02:17:56.080]  When you need to restore, you can just get one file at a time and download it or you
[02:17:56.080 --> 02:18:01.800]  can download everything and to save time in the case of a disaster if you want to, you
[02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:06.000]  can just buy a USB hard drive from them and they'll just put all of your data on the USB
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:09.920]  hard drive and overnight it to you.
[02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:11.320]  It could not be better.
[02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:13.280]  Everything you would want from an online backup.
[02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:14.280]  They do it.
[02:18:14.280 --> 02:18:19.280]  Uh, so go to, if you haven't signed up already and you're crazy, if you haven't go to back
[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:27.880]  blaze.com slash the talk show, that's back blaze.com slash the talk show, uh, and sign
[02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:29.720]  up it in five bucks a month.
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:30.720]  That's it.
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:34.120]  Oh, if there is a second catch, it's the five bucks per month per Mac.
[02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:38.240]  So if you have two Macs, then you're up to 10 bucks a month.
[02:18:38.240 --> 02:18:39.240]  That's a fair deal.
[02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:42.280]  Go sign up.
[02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:43.280]  Back up your crap.
[02:18:43.280 --> 02:18:44.280]  I can't.
[02:18:44.280 --> 02:18:47.680]  I'm telling you, if you don't back up your stuff, you're nuts.
[02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:49.720]  Uh, anyway, what else do you think at the show?
[02:18:49.720 --> 02:18:51.120]  I don't think iPads are coming.
[02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:52.120]  I know.
[02:18:52.120 --> 02:18:53.960]  Oh, you don't think the iPad pros coming?
[02:18:53.960 --> 02:18:54.960]  Yeah, I want to go.
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:55.960]  I'm going to go.
[02:18:55.960 --> 02:18:57.320]  Uh, I'm not going on.
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:18:58.920]  Well, I'm not going to make a bet.
[02:18:58.920 --> 02:19:02.600]  Here's what I will say this honest to God, John, I have, nobody has told me anything
[02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:06.160]  about the event, so I don't have any inside birdies or information about, I don't want
[02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:07.160]  it.
[02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:08.160]  I don't want to know.
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:09.160]  I want to be surprised.
[02:19:09.160 --> 02:19:10.160]  That's my gut feeling.
[02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:13.280]  My gut feeling is that they're going to do the exact same thing they've done in years
[02:19:13.280 --> 02:19:19.900]  past and, um, have an iPad event, a smaller event in October, and they'll do the iPads
[02:19:19.900 --> 02:19:26.160]  and new, maybe like the new iMac with the 4k display on the 21 inch screen.
[02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:29.240]  Um, and talk about El Capitan.
[02:19:29.240 --> 02:19:33.040]  Uh, you know, there's a pattern to the way they do these things.
[02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:39.360]  And, um, the October event is usually, or has been the last few years, new iPads and
[02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:42.320]  some new Mac news like showing off.
[02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:48.100]  And they, I feel like a lot of people in the press forget just how simple Apple does things
[02:19:48.100 --> 02:19:50.000]  and how they often repeat themselves.
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:53.960]  So they'll show off El Capitan and all the features they're going to show are the same
[02:19:53.960 --> 02:19:56.580]  ones that they showed at WWDC in June.
[02:19:56.580 --> 02:19:58.760]  And they do this and people are like, why, why did they do that?
[02:19:58.760 --> 02:20:00.480]  Because, you know, we already knew all this stuff.
[02:20:00.480 --> 02:20:06.000]  They showed us that in June because they just want normal people to know about these features.
[02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:11.360]  And the way you communicate with people who aren't hyperactive news junkies is you repeat
[02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:13.080]  yourself multiple times, right?
[02:20:13.080 --> 02:20:14.080]  It's like running for office.
[02:20:14.080 --> 02:20:17.360]  Like why do politicians keep saying the same things over and over again while they're getting
[02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:18.360]  elected?
[02:20:18.360 --> 02:20:19.800]  Because that's how you get your message across.
[02:20:19.800 --> 02:20:22.320]  So they'll just review what's new in El Capitan.
[02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:25.920]  I don't see how they do all that in one event next week, if they're going to do this.
[02:20:25.920 --> 02:20:26.920]  Yeah.
[02:20:26.920 --> 02:20:27.920]  That's true.
[02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:28.920]  Big new Apple TV.
[02:20:28.920 --> 02:20:29.920]  Right.
[02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:30.920]  Yeah.
[02:20:30.920 --> 02:20:34.480]  I'm hoping they're going to talk about when the watchOS 2 is coming.
[02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:36.680]  I think they're going to do that at next week's event.
[02:20:36.680 --> 02:20:37.680]  This is what I think.
[02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:38.680]  You mean Wednesday?
[02:20:38.680 --> 02:20:39.680]  Wednesday.
[02:20:39.680 --> 02:20:40.680]  This week.
[02:20:40.680 --> 02:20:41.680]  Yeah.
[02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:42.680]  No, that's what I meant.
[02:20:42.680 --> 02:20:43.680]  Yeah.
[02:20:43.680 --> 02:20:44.680]  So this is what I think they're going to do Wednesday.
[02:20:44.680 --> 02:20:48.360]  I think they're going to, I think it's going to be exactly like last year's event.
[02:20:48.360 --> 02:20:50.920]  There'll be three, well, meaning three things.
[02:20:50.920 --> 02:20:54.920]  First will be the new iPhones and I'll probably be Schiller again, exactly like last year.
[02:20:54.920 --> 02:21:00.840]  Phil Schiller will come out and he'll tell us all about the new iPhone 6s and 6s plus
[02:21:00.840 --> 02:21:06.600]  and force touch and whatever else they have to talk about and how it all works.
[02:21:06.600 --> 02:21:08.520]  And here's when they're going to be available.
[02:21:08.520 --> 02:21:13.720]  And I guarantee it's going to be like 10 days later or nine days later on Friday, you know,
[02:21:13.720 --> 02:21:17.360]  the week, the week after, what will that be?
[02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:20.560]  Friday the 18th.
[02:21:20.560 --> 02:21:21.560]  Then part two.
[02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:23.800]  Now, last year, part two was Apple pay.
[02:21:23.800 --> 02:21:27.860]  This year's part two I'll bet is Apple watch.
[02:21:27.860 --> 02:21:31.740]  And it'll be about everything new with a watch 2.0.
[02:21:31.740 --> 02:21:36.120]  And I think I said this on the show a couple of weeks ago, but I wouldn't be surprised
[02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:40.440]  if they came out with new bands for the holiday season.
[02:21:40.440 --> 02:21:44.800]  And I think probably Gurman again, somebody this week had a rumor that they're going to
[02:21:44.800 --> 02:21:52.740]  do new bands, new sport bands, at least, just to have something new to show and new to sell
[02:21:52.740 --> 02:21:55.160]  for the holidays.
[02:21:55.160 --> 02:22:00.040]  And maybe based on now that they have actual sales data, they know which existing bands
[02:22:00.040 --> 02:22:03.920]  are popular and they can, you know, do something like that.
[02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:06.280]  So it's a way to have new hardware to show without new stuff.
[02:22:06.280 --> 02:22:11.820]  But then they'll just review all of the watch 2.0 features that they showed at WWDC.
[02:22:11.820 --> 02:22:17.500]  But then they'll say, and here's when the update will be available.
[02:22:17.500 --> 02:22:22.680]  And then I don't know if they'll do one more thing, but then there will be one more thing
[02:22:22.680 --> 02:22:24.240]  and it'll be Apple TV.
[02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:31.560]  And Apple TV will fill that third and final spot that Apple Watch played last year.
[02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:37.440]  And they're going to have a lot to show because it's all new, it's radically new.
[02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:41.580]  And there's probably going to be like partners there, like I don't know if they'll have Netflix
[02:22:41.580 --> 02:22:42.580]  or HBO again.
[02:22:42.580 --> 02:22:43.960]  Yeah, that could take a long time.
[02:22:43.960 --> 02:22:45.920]  That could, it should take a long time.
[02:22:45.920 --> 02:22:50.560]  I don't see, after what I've just said, those three things, I don't see how there's any
[02:22:50.560 --> 02:22:53.880]  time left for iPads.
[02:22:53.880 --> 02:22:59.720]  And they might even want to talk business, you know, I mean, given the concern over the
[02:22:59.720 --> 02:23:04.400]  Chinese economy, they might just want to say, hey, we're doing really well.
[02:23:04.400 --> 02:23:09.600]  Here's how many iPhones we sold and here's an update on, you know, whatever.
[02:23:09.600 --> 02:23:13.440]  You know what, and you know what, and to get around like not giving numbers, like one thing
[02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:18.420]  I don't think there's any law against is like, here's photographs of one of our new stores
[02:23:18.420 --> 02:23:22.960]  in China and it's jam-packed with people buying things, you know.
[02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:26.360]  Here's a chart with a line going up with no numbers on it.
[02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:28.360]  A Bezos chart.
[02:23:28.360 --> 02:23:35.360]  Here's a Bezos chart, unlabeled axes.
[02:23:35.360 --> 02:23:38.720]  It really, there's those, I don't know if they should be called Bezos charts or New
[02:23:38.720 --> 02:23:43.460]  Yorker charts because it's like, you know how like, there's like, like the, every single
[02:23:43.460 --> 02:23:48.920]  New Yorker cartoon is either two guys on an island or it's a guy in a suit with a chart
[02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:55.480]  either going up or down, right?
[02:23:55.480 --> 02:23:56.480]  That makes a lot of sense.
[02:23:56.480 --> 02:23:57.480]  I think that makes a lot of sense.
[02:23:57.480 --> 02:23:58.480]  I just don't.
[02:23:58.480 --> 02:24:03.440]  And there's, and so then, and then, I mean, the other thing is like the iPad pro, if that's
[02:24:03.440 --> 02:24:08.840]  what, whatever it's going to be, assuming that's what it is, is kind of a thing that
[02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:10.560]  they need to talk about for awhile.
[02:24:10.560 --> 02:24:15.680]  I mean, it's a new, it's a whole new form factor and supposedly it's coming with like
[02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:21.360]  a stylus and keyboards and I mean, that's a, that's a lot to talk about there too.
[02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:29.300]  So and, and if they're going to do a refreshed mini, which is what the, what the rumor is
[02:24:29.300 --> 02:24:35.520]  and not do a refresh or at least not do a significant refresh of the air, that seems
[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:38.320]  like that might be enough to, to fill a whole keynote.
[02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:44.160]  I, I really do, especially, and especially with a review of El Capitan and if they don't
[02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:45.160]  have a separate,
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:46.160]  Oh, so I'm sorry.
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:48.840]  So you were saying the El Capitan one would be the October one?
[02:24:48.840 --> 02:24:49.840]  Yes.
[02:24:49.840 --> 02:24:50.840]  Oh, okay.
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:51.840]  I'm sorry.
[02:24:51.840 --> 02:24:52.840]  Okay.
[02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:53.840]  No, I misunderstood you.
[02:24:53.840 --> 02:24:59.600]  I think next week is I, this week, I guess this week, iPhone, Apple watch 2.0 and an
[02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:04.200]  update on, you know, the amazing things people are doing with their Apple watches and then
[02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:05.200]  Apple TV.
[02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:06.200]  And then that's it.
[02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:07.200]  That's two hours right there.
[02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:08.200]  Yeah.
[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:13.560]  Or even not, even if it isn't two hours, even if it's only 90 minutes or 95 minutes, it
[02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:15.540]  doesn't leave enough time to do the rest.
[02:25:15.540 --> 02:25:16.540]  And I don't think they want to do that.
[02:25:16.540 --> 02:25:19.200]  I don't think they want to, I don't think they want to do too much at once.
[02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:20.800]  Why wouldn't they just have a second event?
[02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:22.620]  So it's to spread out the publicity.
[02:25:22.620 --> 02:25:25.760]  Why in the world would they want to just have all this stuff at once?
[02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:32.600]  And if there's an iPad pro, if I don't, again, I don't like, I'm trying to get away from
[02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:33.600]  knowing stuff.
[02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:34.600]  I don't want to know the secrets anymore.
[02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:35.940]  I want to be surprised.
[02:25:35.940 --> 02:25:36.940]  So I don't know.
[02:25:36.940 --> 02:25:41.320]  And nobody on the inside who has ever said anything to me about an iPad pro makes sense
[02:25:41.320 --> 02:25:42.320]  to me though.
[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:44.880]  And there's an awful lot of smoke, you know, where there's smoke, there's fire and awful
[02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:46.600]  lot of smoke that they're doing it.
[02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:51.440]  I think you're right that it, that takes, that's going to be like a, Hey, we need to
[02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:52.440]  take time.
[02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:55.600]  That's a whole segment of an event to tell you why we're doing this.
[02:25:55.600 --> 02:25:56.600]  Yeah.
[02:25:56.600 --> 02:25:58.960]  And there's a fair amount of explanation that needs to go on there.
[02:25:58.960 --> 02:25:59.960]  I think.
[02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:00.960]  Right.
[02:26:00.960 --> 02:26:03.400]  And I think, I think, I mean, who's it for?
[02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:06.600]  Well, I think it's, you know, what?
[02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:11.440]  What I think is interesting about the iPad pro really interesting is that's a great question.
[02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:16.720]  And the reason I think it's great is I think it's for Tim cook, not only Tim cook, but
[02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:21.200]  in the way that like Steve jobs, like had them make the phone that he wanted.
[02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:25.720]  And he knew that lots of other people would want it too, but it was like, I, the way that
[02:26:25.720 --> 02:26:30.560]  Tim cook talks about iPad and the way he says so many times that he does so much of his
[02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:36.800]  work on iPad and that he's, you know, doing this big push personally into the enterprise
[02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:41.880]  with the, you know, the IBM deal, um, just do this thing that he was on stage at a Cisco
[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:44.440]  event, uh, at the end of August.
[02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:47.400]  I, yeah, well I heard that, Oh, I didn't realize he was on stage.
[02:26:47.400 --> 02:26:48.600]  I heard that they were doing it.
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:55.520]  They were also looking up to do with thing about getting, I, it was into the end of the
[02:26:55.520 --> 02:26:56.520]  enterprise.
[02:26:56.520 --> 02:26:57.800]  Was it more about, I forget exactly.
[02:26:57.800 --> 02:27:00.160]  It was last Monday and I don't think it was straight.
[02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:01.160]  Oh no.
[02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:02.160]  Okay.
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:03.160]  So this was more recent.
[02:27:03.160 --> 02:27:04.160]  Yeah.
[02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:05.320]  Uh, it was a huge event in Vegas.
[02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:11.040]  It was like the, some kind of big Cisco conference with, you know, and it was like in the, um,
[02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:14.800]  the MGM grand, like the arena where all the big fights are like the Mayweather fight and
[02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:15.800]  stuff like that.
[02:27:15.800 --> 02:27:18.920]  Like a thousands out, you know, six to 10,000 seat arena.
[02:27:18.920 --> 02:27:19.920]  I don't know.
[02:27:19.920 --> 02:27:30.640]  Not the Ken Sago fight, not the Ken Sago that wasn't a Denny's parking lot, the parking
[02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:37.000]  lot of the Denny's, uh, uh, no, but he, he made an unannounced surprise appearance on
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.360]  stage at the Cisco thing.
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:42.640]  I got like some email about it, but, uh, I don't know that it's been publicized, but
[02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:46.520]  he, you know, he spoke and apparently had great length and it was really, really interesting
[02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:53.080]  and it made a very compelling case for, you know, like that the iPad, we've only reached
[02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:58.240]  the tip of the iceberg, but it's, it's going to play a tremendous role in business computing
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:01.880]  going forward as like the, I, I really do.
[02:28:01.880 --> 02:28:02.960]  I think he believes it.
[02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:05.040]  I think he, I think he really thinks it's true.
[02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:11.080]  So I really, and I really think that he himself is, is going to use an iPad pro a lot.
[02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:15.240]  Um, and I think that he, he seemed so interested in it personally.
[02:28:15.240 --> 02:28:21.560]  I can't see why they, how they wouldn't put a lot of, um, time into the unveiling of it,
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:23.280]  you know, the ad at an event.
[02:28:23.280 --> 02:28:26.520]  And again, I don't see how they fit that in one event next week.
[02:28:26.520 --> 02:28:32.040]  So the, and the, the, just to head down off this possible, I mean, I could be wrong cause
[02:28:32.040 --> 02:28:36.040]  I know Gurman is saying it's coming next week or that it's planned to.
[02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:38.400]  And John Patkowski said that too.
[02:28:38.400 --> 02:28:44.560]  But Patkowski said the same thing last year, uh, like in August, like when he same thing,
[02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:51.240]  like when the, when he got the, the leak of the date for the September event, um, he said,
[02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:55.680]  you know, that it's expected to be new phones and the apples, what we then called their
[02:28:55.680 --> 02:28:59.240]  wearable and new iPads.
[02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:03.520]  The one thing, the one thing that goes against our argument though, is the, is the size of
[02:29:03.520 --> 02:29:04.520]  the venue.
[02:29:04.520 --> 02:29:05.520]  All right.
[02:29:05.520 --> 02:29:06.520]  All right.
[02:29:06.520 --> 02:29:07.520]  Hold that.
[02:29:07.520 --> 02:29:09.600]  I have, I have an explanation on it.
[02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:10.600]  Yes.
[02:29:10.600 --> 02:29:11.600]  Okay.
[02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:12.600]  All right.
[02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:13.600]  I have an explanation.
[02:29:13.600 --> 02:29:17.560]  I have an explanation that the WWDC country keynote this year went over two hours, well
[02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:18.560]  over two hours.
[02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:19.560]  Yeah.
[02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:21.000]  So why not just go over two hours again?
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:24.400]  Uh, I don't think they were happy that that went over two hours.
[02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:31.200]  I think that, uh, you know, it should have been, I, you know, I've been a bit jam packed
[02:29:31.200 --> 02:29:34.840]  with real, you know, full of exciting information at that, that, that, that, that whole, the
[02:29:34.840 --> 02:29:40.920]  whole Apple music thing was talking to, you know, some, uh, you know, there were some
[02:29:40.920 --> 02:29:45.040]  Apple people who, you know, obviously it's off the record, you know, but you know, more
[02:29:45.040 --> 02:29:49.640]  or less we're like, Hey, sorry about this.
[02:29:49.640 --> 02:29:53.760]  You know what, Ben, Ben Thompson and I went, we're sitting together for it.
[02:29:53.760 --> 02:29:57.640]  And we were like, we, we asked a friend, you know, like, we were like, the word was that
[02:29:57.640 --> 02:29:58.640]  it was going to be long.
[02:29:58.640 --> 02:30:03.680]  That's, and we, I asked somebody I know who would know, uh, you know, someone from Apple
[02:30:03.680 --> 02:30:06.720]  PR and it was like, Hey, should we, should we run to the bat?
[02:30:06.720 --> 02:30:09.880]  Because run into the bathroom at WWDC is kind of a pain in the ass because there's so many
[02:30:09.880 --> 02:30:13.720]  thousands of people streaming in like the, the secret is to go all the way downstairs.
[02:30:13.720 --> 02:30:16.960]  Don't, you know, you're the keynotes on the third level.
[02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:17.960]  Don't go to that.
[02:30:17.960 --> 02:30:18.960]  Don't go to the one that's closest.
[02:30:18.960 --> 02:30:19.960]  Go further.
[02:30:19.960 --> 02:30:20.960]  Right.
[02:30:20.960 --> 02:30:25.520]  Um, yeah, like a funny side story is Ben and I both like, we were like, Oh, we better go.
[02:30:25.520 --> 02:30:30.100]  So we went and you know, we, you know, a couple minutes ago before the keynote goes, we went
[02:30:30.100 --> 02:30:33.240]  down to the first floor to, you know, hit the restroom.
[02:30:33.240 --> 02:30:34.240]  Glad that I did.
[02:30:34.240 --> 02:30:35.560]  It's a son of a bitch ran long.
[02:30:35.560 --> 02:30:38.960]  And the funny thing is we come back upstairs and we get to the third floor and the door
[02:30:38.960 --> 02:30:39.960]  to the men's room.
[02:30:39.960 --> 02:30:41.720]  It was out way out the door.
[02:30:41.720 --> 02:30:45.960]  I mean, there must've been a hundred, a hundred guys waiting in line to go to the, the men's
[02:30:45.960 --> 02:30:48.360]  room on the third floor of Moscone.
[02:30:48.360 --> 02:30:51.600]  And Ben, I see me, I don't, I don't, I'm not a humanitarian.
[02:30:51.600 --> 02:30:53.560]  I was just going to go take my seat.
[02:30:53.560 --> 02:30:54.560]  Ben stopped.
[02:30:54.560 --> 02:30:57.880]  And Ben is a very nice guy and started telling people, it was like, Hey, you know, you can
[02:30:57.880 --> 02:31:01.120]  just go down to the first floor and there's no line.
[02:31:01.120 --> 02:31:04.680]  There's literally no line to the first floor men's room and every, nobody took his advice
[02:31:04.680 --> 02:31:06.320]  and because they were scared.
[02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:07.320]  Yeah.
[02:31:07.320 --> 02:31:08.320]  They were scared that it was like,
[02:31:08.320 --> 02:31:11.040]  Those are some sort of scam.
[02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:12.040]  Yeah.
[02:31:12.040 --> 02:31:13.040]  Yeah.
[02:31:13.040 --> 02:31:14.040]  And, and Ben like took it hard.
[02:31:14.040 --> 02:31:20.760]  He's like, I, you know, and I was like, this is why it doesn't pay to help people, Ben.
[02:31:20.760 --> 02:31:23.880]  But anyway, I don't think they were happy that that went over two hours.
[02:31:23.880 --> 02:31:27.000]  They just felt like this is what we have to do at WWDC this year.
[02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:31.180]  And they needed to, you know, they felt like they needed to get Apple music announced.
[02:31:31.180 --> 02:31:32.920]  And so therefore it had to be over two hours.
[02:31:32.920 --> 02:31:38.400]  I feel like they, they, their internal goal to keep them all under two hours.
[02:31:38.400 --> 02:31:41.200]  You know, they'll make an exception if they feel like they need to, but if they don't
[02:31:41.200 --> 02:31:42.200]  need to, they won't.
[02:31:42.200 --> 02:31:43.960]  And I feel like they don't need to this time.
[02:31:43.960 --> 02:31:46.160]  Why they don't have to do one.
[02:31:46.160 --> 02:31:49.720]  It would be breaking the pattern to do that.
[02:31:49.720 --> 02:31:50.720]  Yeah.
[02:31:50.720 --> 02:31:51.720]  Yeah.
[02:31:51.720 --> 02:31:52.720]  All right.
[02:31:52.720 --> 02:31:53.720]  What was the thing I said we'd get back to?
[02:31:53.720 --> 02:31:54.720]  Oh, the venue.
[02:31:54.720 --> 02:31:55.720]  The venue.
[02:31:55.720 --> 02:32:00.120]  So the venue is Bill Graham civic auditorium.
[02:32:00.120 --> 02:32:01.120]  I've never been there.
[02:32:01.120 --> 02:32:02.120]  I don't know.
[02:32:02.120 --> 02:32:05.480]  I hope I get there.
[02:32:05.480 --> 02:32:08.800]  If you do go to the bathroom in the basement, even if there, even if there's no bathroom
[02:32:08.800 --> 02:32:09.800]  down there.
[02:32:09.800 --> 02:32:16.640]  Well, so it's a huge place and I guess it can be configured to fill, fill thousands
[02:32:16.640 --> 02:32:17.800]  of people.
[02:32:17.800 --> 02:32:23.840]  But my understanding, and again, I, this is just a sort of, you know, lick my finger and
[02:32:23.840 --> 02:32:30.520]  put it in the wind, but it sounds to me like they, they haven't really increased the number
[02:32:30.520 --> 02:32:32.360]  of people invited.
[02:32:32.360 --> 02:32:38.880]  Like it doesn't seem like press invitations are all that easy to get.
[02:32:38.880 --> 02:32:42.760]  Which makes it sound like there's not, now it could be that they are going to have thousands
[02:32:42.760 --> 02:32:46.440]  and thousands and thousands of people or whatever, but that they've invited people from China
[02:32:46.440 --> 02:32:50.280]  or that it's a bunch of people from the TV industry, you know, like people who write
[02:32:50.280 --> 02:32:52.560]  about TV and Hollywood reporters.
[02:32:52.560 --> 02:32:56.600]  And so that I wouldn't know this because they haven't increased the number of you know,
[02:32:56.600 --> 02:32:59.200]  the people I know in the tech people.
[02:32:59.200 --> 02:33:00.800]  I didn't get an invite.
[02:33:00.800 --> 02:33:01.800]  There you go.
[02:33:01.800 --> 02:33:07.320]  See, but that's just, here's my, my thinking is that maybe the reason that they have this
[02:33:07.320 --> 02:33:09.560]  big venue, I don't know what it even looks like inside.
[02:33:09.560 --> 02:33:13.140]  So I, you know, I could be that this doesn't, this, what I'm going to say, it doesn't make
[02:33:13.140 --> 02:33:14.140]  any sense.
[02:33:14.140 --> 02:33:21.680]  But remember last year they built this big white box in front of the Flint Center down
[02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:25.120]  there in Cupertino and nobody knew what it was.
[02:33:25.120 --> 02:33:29.680]  And it was a big demo area, a big temporary demo area for all the new stuff they wanted
[02:33:29.680 --> 02:33:40.320]  to show like a one day, two hour Apple store just for demonstrating the new watch and everything.
[02:33:40.320 --> 02:33:45.460]  My thought is what if they did that again this year, but they wanted to do it all indoors
[02:33:45.460 --> 02:33:50.160]  that maybe that's why they have it in this huge area so that there may not be tons of
[02:33:50.160 --> 02:33:55.200]  press seating or seating for people to see the event, but that they've built like a big
[02:33:55.200 --> 02:33:56.600]  area to demonstrate this.
[02:33:56.600 --> 02:34:01.480]  And I think just thinking about it, if you want to demonstrate Apple TV in a realistic
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:05.040]  way, you're going to, it, you need a lot of, you've got to have a lot of space, right?
[02:34:05.040 --> 02:34:06.640]  Cause you got to have a bunch of TVs.
[02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:07.640]  Yeah.
[02:34:07.640 --> 02:34:10.840]  And maybe like couches set up or something, you know, so, you know, sit down and watch
[02:34:10.840 --> 02:34:13.920]  a ball game or something, right?
[02:34:13.920 --> 02:34:14.920]  So that's my guess.
[02:34:14.920 --> 02:34:18.480]  My guess is just, and just a guess, I mean, how the hell would I know?
[02:34:18.480 --> 02:34:23.240]  I don't know what the hell's going on in the bill, bill Graham civic, but this is my guess
[02:34:23.240 --> 02:34:29.200]  is that they've built a big, huge hands-on area inside and that's why it's in a big venue.
[02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:30.920]  Not because they're inviting lots of people.
[02:34:30.920 --> 02:34:31.920]  Okay.
[02:34:31.920 --> 02:34:36.160]  Well, not that they're not inviting lots of people, even if, you know, yeah, I was assuming
[02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:40.200]  that it was going to be all the way through iPads, but, but now that we've talked, I,
[02:34:40.200 --> 02:34:44.080]  I think I'm going to say, I'm going to say that we're right, that it's not that iPads
[02:34:44.080 --> 02:34:45.240]  are going to be next month.
[02:34:45.240 --> 02:34:46.240]  I'm also predicting.
[02:34:46.240 --> 02:34:51.040]  I'll predict that Mark Gurman will say that he wasn't wrong about the iPads.
[02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:55.440]  He'll say he was right, but that they moved them to October because it leaked that they
[02:34:55.440 --> 02:35:02.440]  were going to come out because his, his report that they leaked, that's unfair.
[02:35:02.440 --> 02:35:03.440]  Is it unfair?
[02:35:03.440 --> 02:35:04.440]  It only happened.
[02:35:04.440 --> 02:35:05.720]  Well, did that happen more than once?
[02:35:05.720 --> 02:35:15.340]  No, it was just with the design of the, the health kit or health, health app design, right?
[02:35:15.340 --> 02:35:16.340]  But that he wasn't wrong.
[02:35:16.340 --> 02:35:17.340]  He was, he was right.
[02:35:17.340 --> 02:35:22.000]  And they moved it out of spite.
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:23.000]  They are very spiteful.
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:29.080]  And again, if the, and I would just emphasize it, they could, I guess, squeeze in iPad,
[02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:33.960]  but then if they do, then there's nothing left to have an event for El Capitan and any
[02:35:33.960 --> 02:35:35.760]  new max that they want to unveil.
[02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:36.760]  Yeah.
[02:35:36.760 --> 02:35:37.760]  Right.
[02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:38.760]  And I thought it was interesting.
[02:35:38.760 --> 02:35:42.360]  I thought it was interesting too, that Gurman even said that he, you know, he said that
[02:35:42.360 --> 02:35:46.960]  he thinks that the iPad sources say the iPad's supposed to come out at this event this week,
[02:35:46.960 --> 02:35:54.280]  but then he himself said that the new retina 21 inch iMac is coming in October.
[02:35:54.280 --> 02:36:00.840]  And that's like, well, you know, a new, I knew cool new retina iMac coming in October
[02:36:00.840 --> 02:36:04.120]  sure sounds like a perfect thing to announce at an event in October.
[02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:05.120]  Right?
[02:36:05.120 --> 02:36:06.120]  Yeah.
[02:36:06.120 --> 02:36:12.160]  So anyway, you'd think, but it'll be interesting.
[02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:13.160]  Anything else?
[02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:14.800]  I think that's enough.
[02:36:14.800 --> 02:36:15.800]  Yeah.
[02:36:15.800 --> 02:36:16.800]  That's pretty good.
[02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:18.800]  I think that's enough too.
[02:36:18.800 --> 02:36:20.200]  It's just enough.
[02:36:20.200 --> 02:36:21.200]  Just enough.
[02:36:21.200 --> 02:36:22.200]  All right.
[02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:23.200]  John Molt.
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:24.200]  Exactly the right amount.
[02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:25.200]  Always good to talk to you.
[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:27.340]  Always a good time.
[02:36:27.340 --> 02:36:32.020]  Everybody can get all the molts they want at a very fine website.
[02:36:32.020 --> 02:36:33.020]  Very nice website.
[02:36:33.020 --> 02:36:34.020]  Very, very nice.
[02:36:34.020 --> 02:36:37.100]  I don't know what's going on at a very fine website.
[02:36:37.100 --> 02:36:39.960]  It's not as good as what's going on at a very nice website though.
[02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:40.960]  Yeah.
[02:36:40.960 --> 02:36:45.320]  Is it got to be the nice, it's got to be the number one hit if I Google very nice website.
[02:36:45.320 --> 02:36:47.680]  I would think so.
[02:36:47.680 --> 02:36:48.680]  Very nice website.
[02:36:48.680 --> 02:36:50.680]  Except I'm not using Google anymore.
[02:36:50.680 --> 02:36:51.680]  Yep.
[02:36:51.680 --> 02:36:52.680]  John Molt's is very nice website.
[02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:53.680]  There we go.
[02:36:53.680 --> 02:36:55.400]  So you can find out more.
[02:36:55.400 --> 02:36:56.600]  That's branding, baby.
[02:36:56.600 --> 02:36:57.960]  That's branding right there.
[02:36:57.960 --> 02:37:02.600]  If you enjoy the sounds of his voice on a podcast, you're in luck.
[02:37:02.600 --> 02:37:03.600]  Sorry.
[02:37:03.600 --> 02:37:09.240]  Please have your hearing checked.
[02:37:09.240 --> 02:37:13.760]  There's turning this car around, if you Google for turning this car around, you'll find,
[02:37:13.760 --> 02:37:28.120]  that's John's show where he talks about parenting and stuff like that with John Armstrong.
[02:37:28.120 --> 02:37:29.120]  Lex Friedman.
[02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:30.120]  Yes.
[02:37:30.120 --> 02:37:31.120]  Lex Friedman.
[02:37:31.120 --> 02:37:32.120]  Lex Friedman.
[02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:33.120]  I forgot about Lex.
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:34.760]  And you got, what else you got?
[02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:44.200]  The Rebound where we talk about technology with Lex Friedman and Dan Morin and Molt's
[02:37:44.200 --> 02:37:45.200]  at Twitter.
[02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:46.680]  And Molt's, at Molt's.
[02:37:46.680 --> 02:37:47.680]  Yep.
[02:37:47.680 --> 02:37:48.680]  Pretty good.
[02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:49.680]  Pretty good.
[02:37:49.680 --> 02:37:50.680]  Got in there quick.
[02:37:50.680 --> 02:37:51.680]  Got in there quick and got that.
[02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:52.680]  Yeah.
[02:37:52.680 --> 02:37:55.760]  I do have to erase Gruber.
[02:37:55.760 --> 02:37:57.680]  Gruber's too popular a name in Europe.
[02:37:57.680 --> 02:38:00.560]  It's a big name in Germany, so that if I go...
[02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:02.640]  Do you get lots of people asking for your handle?
[02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:03.640]  No.
[02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:05.720]  I don't get a lot of people asking for it though.
[02:38:05.720 --> 02:38:08.920]  You follow Jesse Char on Instagram?
[02:38:08.920 --> 02:38:09.920]  Every system.
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:10.920]  Hysterical.
[02:38:10.920 --> 02:38:11.920]  I never know.
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:12.920]  It's so funny.
[02:38:12.920 --> 02:38:13.920]  You know what?
[02:38:13.920 --> 02:38:14.920]  I never know whether it's a joke or not.
[02:38:14.920 --> 02:38:15.920]  Because people...
[02:38:15.920 --> 02:38:17.160]  Yeah, because people, it's become a joke now.
[02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:18.160]  Yeah.
[02:38:18.160 --> 02:38:19.160]  Right.
[02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:22.040]  She's got the at Jesse, just plain J-E-S-S-I-E on Instagram.
[02:38:22.040 --> 02:38:27.640]  And every post she ever makes, there's somebody, usually some young girl named, you know, Jess
[02:38:27.640 --> 02:38:31.880]  77, whatever, handle name.
[02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:32.880]  B-squared.
[02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:34.560]  I've never heard these kids come up with the handle names.
[02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:38.000]  But I mean, did you ever look, does your kid text at all?
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:39.000]  Oh, yeah.
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.920]  Did you ever look at the names of, like, the iMessage names of his friends?
[02:38:41.920 --> 02:38:42.920]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:43.920]  It looks like a...
[02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:45.920]  They bear no recognition.
[02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:46.920]  No.
[02:38:46.920 --> 02:38:47.920]  No.
[02:38:47.920 --> 02:38:48.920]  Who's this?
[02:38:48.920 --> 02:38:49.920]  Yeah.
[02:38:49.920 --> 02:38:51.880]  It looks like a mistake.
[02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:53.200]  Somebody asking, can I have your handle?
[02:38:53.200 --> 02:38:54.360]  Can I have your username?
[02:38:54.360 --> 02:38:55.360]  As though...
[02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:56.360]  Right.
[02:38:56.360 --> 02:38:57.360]  Like, you just say, sure.
[02:38:57.360 --> 02:38:58.360]  Yeah.
[02:38:58.360 --> 02:38:59.360]  Why not?
[02:38:59.360 --> 02:39:00.360]  Sure.
[02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:02.000]  Why wouldn't I give it to you?
[02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:03.000]  Teenage stranger.
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:04.720]  No, nobody asks for mine.
[02:39:04.720 --> 02:39:10.760]  Teenage stranger who has 15 followers compared to my thousands.
[02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:14.240]  It seems like a good deal.
[02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:16.040]  Wonder what ever happened with that guy who had...
[02:39:16.040 --> 02:39:17.320]  I know we have to wrap it up.
[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:19.720]  Whatever happened with that guy who has the at alphabet Twitter account?
[02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:20.720]  I don't know.
[02:39:20.720 --> 02:39:21.720]  I don't know.
[02:39:21.720 --> 02:39:22.720]  Yeah.
[02:39:22.720 --> 02:39:23.720]  That'd be something to look into.
[02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:24.720]  That's the way I say it.
[02:39:24.720 --> 02:39:25.720]  So...
[02:39:25.720 --> 02:39:26.720]  Okay, hang on.
[02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:27.720]  Yeah.
[02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:28.720]  Alphabet.
[02:39:28.720 --> 02:39:29.720]  Yeah.
[02:39:29.720 --> 02:39:30.720]  Oh, I spelled it wrong.
[02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:36.120]  I'll take the T off.
[02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:37.120]  That's still him.
[02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:38.120]  Yeah, it's still him.
[02:39:38.120 --> 02:39:39.120]  It says I'm not affiliated...
[02:39:39.120 --> 02:39:40.120]  I'm not affiliated with Google-slash-alphabet.
[02:39:40.120 --> 02:39:41.120]  Yeah.
[02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:42.120]  Have a good trip.
[02:39:42.120 --> 02:39:43.120]  All right.
[02:39:43.120 --> 02:39:44.120]  Thanks.
[02:39:44.120 --> 02:39:45.120]  Talk to you.
[02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:46.120]  Mention my name.
[02:39:46.120 --> 02:39:47.120]  Talk to you again.
[02:39:47.120 --> 02:39:48.120]  I will.
[02:39:48.120 --> 02:39:49.120]  I'll put in a good word for you.
[02:39:49.120 --> 02:39:50.120]  Win big prizes.
[02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:51.120]  Yeah.
[02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:53.680]  I usually sign up as if I get my press badge in your name, just in case.
[02:39:53.680 --> 02:39:56.240]  That would explain why I'm not getting invites.
[02:39:56.240 --> 02:39:57.240]  Thanks.
[02:39:57.240 --> 02:39:58.240]  He's here.
[02:39:58.240 --> 02:40:00.680]  Why do you guys even look at him and think he's already here?
