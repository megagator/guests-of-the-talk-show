[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  I haven't washed my hands. I haven't washed my hands in 20 years.
[00:09.000 --> 00:13.000]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I gotta jump in.
[00:13.000 --> 00:22.000]  Alright, remember last episode with Jason Snell and I misremembered some sort of joke I made over 10 years ago about never washing my hands.
[00:22.000 --> 00:30.000]  I thought it was on the podcast. It turns out it was a tweet that I wrote pretty sure during the swine flu epidemic.
[00:30.000 --> 00:36.000]  Stupid tweet, stupid joke about never washing my hands. Yeah, real funny now.
[00:36.000 --> 00:44.000]  But anyway, I made the joke on Twitter. My pal Daniel Jalkett took that tweet, wrote a beautiful little song about it.
[00:44.000 --> 00:53.000]  And what I was going to do last episode is when I referenced it, grab the audio from the old song that Jalkett wrote, splice it into the show.
[00:53.000 --> 01:05.000]  Would have been a funny little gag. After the show, I listened to the song again, realized part of my misremembering was that the song is chock full of F-bombs because my tweet was too.
[01:05.000 --> 01:15.000]  Can't really just jump that in to a podcast without warning. So I'm using the song as the opening theme song to this episode.
[01:15.000 --> 01:21.000]  But I have to jump in right here and warn everybody that the song is chock full of F-bombs.
[01:21.000 --> 01:28.000]  So skip ahead about a minute if you want to avoid them. Otherwise, enjoy.
[01:28.000 --> 01:45.000]  I haven't washed my hands. I haven't washed my hands in 20 years and a bunch of fucking pigs won't prompt me to end that streak.
[01:45.000 --> 02:01.000]  No, I haven't wash my hands. I said I haven't wash my hands in 20 years and a bunch of fucking pigs won't prompt me to end that streak.
[02:01.000 --> 02:15.000]  Cause a bunch of fucking pigs can't prompt me to do anything.
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.000]  From the archives.
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  Suddenly relevant again.
[02:20.000 --> 02:26.000]  What did you say to me when I told you I was going to play that song and you said there's always a tweet?
[02:26.000 --> 02:31.000]  Yeah, that's your version of Trump. There's always a tweet for everything he does.
[02:31.000 --> 02:39.000]  Yeah, I totally misremembered that in so many ways on the last episode. I thought it was on my old podcast with Dan Benjamin.
[02:39.000 --> 02:44.000]  I forgot that it was a tweet. I just remembered that Jowkit did this really sweet, sweet song.
[02:44.000 --> 02:55.000]  It's a beautiful little song with terribly profane lyrics and a sentiment that just doesn't even just doesn't hold water anymore.
[02:55.000 --> 03:00.000]  I'm washing my hands so often.
[03:00.000 --> 03:01.000]  I know.
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.000]  You can invest in moisturizer.
[03:03.000 --> 03:08.000]  But that's the advantage of having been around the internet for 10, 15 years now.
[03:08.000 --> 03:14.000]  I've got an 11 year old song that is a perfect theme song for the show.
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.000]  Lucky you.
[03:17.000 --> 03:18.000]  Oh my God.
[03:18.000 --> 03:25.000]  So Amy was telling me that. All right. Everybody knows hand sanitizer is out of stock everywhere.
[03:25.000 --> 03:32.000]  I think it's beautiful. I think it's fun. You know, everybody knows I enjoy an occasional drink here and there.
[03:32.000 --> 03:42.000]  I enjoy the fact that distilleries, beer distilleries, booze distilleries all around the country are ramping up production or making hand sanitizer.
[03:42.000 --> 03:50.000]  I think I saw that the Tito's the Tito's vodka people, I forget how they're making like they plan to make like tons, tons of hand sanitizer.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  Great move.
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.000]  I know there's a place here in Philly. I forget the name of it, but I know they're making it.
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.000]  And, you know, they don't have a license to make it or something like that. But so they're just giving it away.
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  You just show up and you can just take.
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.000]  I do feel, though, I don't know if you saw the Tito's one. Did you see the Tito's one?
[04:08.000 --> 04:14.000]  I didn't. No. Good on them, you know, in terms of the spirit.
[04:14.000 --> 04:23.000]  The problem with the Tito's one is they're shipping it in bottles that look like the little Tito's airplane bottles, you know, vodka.
[04:23.000 --> 04:30.000]  And there's just like little tiny words like it just says like Tito's and then it says like hand sanitizer and it says like do not drink.
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  Yeah. You know somebody's going to end up drinking one.
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.000]  It just looks it just looks a little too much like Tito's and a little too little like Purell.
[04:40.000 --> 04:47.000]  I mean, with all the kids in homeschool and all of us locked up in our houses, somebody's going to be hitting those little bottles sooner or later.
[04:47.000 --> 04:53.000]  I'll try to remember to put a link in the show notes to the Tito's bottle. How are you holding up?
[04:53.000 --> 04:59.000]  Oh, OK. You know, pretty good. I work from home a lot already and a lot of our team is distributed.
[04:59.000 --> 05:07.000]  So in some ways we were sort of ready for a lot of this. We didn't have to really disrupt our business life or whatever.
[05:07.000 --> 05:15.000]  But then, you know, personally, of course, I think everybody's dealing with the increased mental cognitive load of just viral outbreak.
[05:15.000 --> 05:24.000]  Plus, you know, kids off school and trying to manage all that. And single parents especially, obviously, are super slammed.
[05:24.000 --> 05:29.000]  So, yeah, hold up. OK. How about yourself? How's it over there in Philly? Ah, pretty good.
[05:29.000 --> 05:34.000]  You know, I like the three of us are temperamentally suited to staying at home.
[05:34.000 --> 05:45.000]  Jonas, I don't believe has been out of pajamas other than the shower. It's sent for him since school ended over a week ago.
[05:45.000 --> 05:54.000]  I'm not sure. And I think Amy went to the gym maybe last Monday and I don't believe she's left the house either.
[05:54.000 --> 06:04.000]  So the two of them are actually literally housebound. I'm on, you know, I'm leaving two or three times a week to pick up groceries.
[06:04.000 --> 06:10.000]  Yeah, you're on foraging duty, right? You're the one who's taken taking the scouting role.
[06:10.000 --> 06:16.000]  Yeah. You know, we're getting deliveries. You know, the deliveries are a crapshoot. I mean, I can't complain.
[06:16.000 --> 06:25.000]  Living in the city, I think, is pretty good. And we've got deliveries. But it's, you know, and there is some serious tech overlap here.
[06:25.000 --> 06:32.000]  You know, we've got a Whole Foods, a couple Whole Foods in Philly, but we have a big new one.
[06:32.000 --> 06:41.000]  You know, I think it's maybe like a mile, a mile on the dot walk. Huge, just cavernous.
[06:41.000 --> 06:51.000]  And it was built, you know, I think within a year of Amazon's acquisition. It was really, it's really one of the, it's got to be one of the newest Whole Foods.
[06:51.000 --> 07:03.000]  You know, it, but there's different delivery services, you know, and it's like Amazon Prime Pantry, I believe, is now not operational. It's like, that's, that's the thing.
[07:03.000 --> 07:20.000]  We get the stuff. It ended up crumbling a few days ago. I believe for, well, actually, I have a friend who lives in Philly, and he's the one who first alerted me to the fact that they were kind of crumbling under the weight of all the orders and everything and obviously lack of delivery people, etc.
[07:20.000 --> 07:32.000]  Yeah. And so we're still getting stuff, but it's, and again, I do not want to complain. We've got food. Amy's, you know, preparing good meals every night. We're eating well.
[07:32.000 --> 07:43.000]  But it's just so like in normal times, you'd be infuriated. Whereas in those times, you're just happy to get anything, but you just get like a random 50% of what you ordered.
[07:43.000 --> 07:48.000]  Yeah, yeah. Developing menus on the fly as you walk through and see what's left.
[07:48.000 --> 08:02.000]  Yeah, yeah. And Amy's doing a hell of a job where it's like, you know, you know, big tent pole items in our plan menu just don't show up. And it's like, well, right. I'll wing it. And it's like, Hey, this is actually good random protein. Let's go at it.
[08:02.000 --> 08:11.000]  Yeah. And then there's other things like, so we have a supermarket chain here. Real big, always been big in Philly is ACME.
[08:11.000 --> 08:25.000]  That's not a great name, right? That is a great name. Should be born. That's a classic. That's a great name. I forget if ACME, I think ACME uses a delivery service.
[08:25.000 --> 08:45.000]  You know, it's not ACME who people who deliver it. It's some website that I forget the name of it. But anyway, the difference between the Whole Foods, which comes from Amazon, and the one with the regular supermarket with ACME is ACME.
[08:45.000 --> 09:08.000]  Yesterday, she was on. So this was on Tuesday, and she got a Sunday delivery window. So that's five days away. You know, I mean, again, you don't complain. But the difference is that like with the ACME one, you've got this delivery window and she can like add, she can add items to her order up until like Sunday morning.
[09:08.000 --> 09:21.000]  Yeah, until they send somebody out to shop for it. Yeah. Whereas the Whole Foods one, it's like you put an order in and they give you a window and whatever you ordered, you get whatever they can find that was on that list.
[09:21.000 --> 09:23.000]  Right. Right.
[09:23.000 --> 09:35.000]  Again, we've got food where nobody's going hungry. But it's just weird. It's weird what stuff is selling out now. Like it's like corn chips.
[09:35.000 --> 09:42.000]  Yeah, corn chips. It was so weird. I was like, I just want some tortilla chips so I can dip them in my salsa.
[09:42.000 --> 09:54.000]  That's the thing is we got some really good salsa. We got really good fresh like pico de gallo and we have some corn chips, but now we're like rationing them. We're like...
[09:54.000 --> 09:57.000]  Yeah. Don't eat too many. Don't eat too many.
[09:57.000 --> 10:00.000]  Who would have thought corn chips?
[10:00.000 --> 10:16.000]  I know that one was one random weird one. There's certainly some different ones we have. You know, we're, I'm pretty lucky. I mean, I live in a fairly, I guess you'd call it, you know, rural-ish town, right? So there's like 500,000 people, right? So it's not like tiny.
[10:16.000 --> 10:40.000]  But at the same time, it's a farm town. You know, I live in a farm town where the primary economic output is either real estate because of urban sprawl or suburban sprawl or farming, right? So all the big monies in farming and we produce in this valley, something like two thirds of all the fruit and veg for the United States. You know, it's actually a really ridiculous amount.
[10:40.000 --> 11:07.000]  So we actually have an enormous glut of produce. Like if I go, we have a local place, we have a couple chains, you know, we have Whole Foods really close by. We have a, you know, Save Mart, which is like a Western chain. And then we have this place called The Market, which is as big as a Save Mart, you know, it's a normal size grocery store, but it is very much, you know, a locally owned version of that.
[11:07.000 --> 11:36.000]  Which means, of course, that you're going to find the same cast of general characters as far as foods and food groups. But the brands are a little different. You know, you get all the major brands, you know, like a pasta, you get a Berea, and you get, you know, the various pasta brands that are similar to anywhere across the US or elsewhere in the world. But then you'll get a lot of like local brands, you know, or smaller distributors who distribute to indie chains rather than, you know, the like, Oh, can you deliver a billion in units to the to all of our grocery stores across the world?
[11:36.000 --> 12:06.000]  Or grocery stores across the United States or whatever, right? So you just get that mix. And the one thing that you do get there is like, I went and, you know, obviously, aisles are empty and all this stuff. But this particular store has a lot of Italian stuff. Like it's, it's got a little bit of extra layer of Italian, you know, like, maybe like a, you know, instead of one kind of sardines, there's like six, you know what I mean? Like, it's one of those things where it's, you could tell Italian
[12:06.000 --> 12:36.000]  people shop here, probably older Italian people, you know, it's got a little bit of Italian deli mixed in with all the normal grocery stuff. So you go through and of course, the pasta aisles cleaned out, right? I mean, just bam. But then there's also like other weird things cleaned out, like, you know, it's the olive oil selection is super picked over, you know, things like that. But the one thing that they do have because of where we are in the valley, which I think is maybe different than a lot of other places, is that the the
[12:36.000 --> 13:06.000]  vegetable section, like floor to ceiling, absolutely packed. And then you go to the regular grocery store, and it's like, you know, it's kind of anemic, you know, so I don't know, it's an interesting, I think, a regional thing where you'll go some places and certain things are your universal, like a lot of dry goods and things that get picked over. But then a lot of other things are, you know, just regionally available. Yeah. Yeah. We did what this bean thing. No, I'm beans. Oh, no. Because it's like it's because it's protein that stays good forever. Right?
[13:06.000 --> 13:36.000]  Beans do stay good for quite a while. I mean, not forever, but for a while. They are. I don't know if you consider them shelf stable. Maybe you do. I don't know. But they're they're pretty, you know, you can keep them around for a bit. And people are buying the crap out of beans. And then like, I can't remember if maybe it was the Times or somebody did an article where all these people are buying beans. And I don't like to generalize, but they're like, you know, all these millennials are buying beans, and they don't know how to cook them. Like, what do we do? What do we do with beans?
[13:36.000 --> 14:06.000]  Like, certain people are gonna, you know, if you're older or whatever, you remember all the bean dishes, maybe, you know, your parents or grandparents especially used to make, you know, it's like, oh, we're having garbanzos with this, you know, or, you know, we're having red beans with this. And certainly a lot of cooking, like Indian cooking or Thai cooking will use beans a lot and stuff like that. And then, of course, Mexican cooking uses beans quite a bit. But I think a lot of a lot of people are just going,
[14:06.000 --> 14:36.000]  oh, we need shelf stable, just get some beans, get some beans. And they're like, what do we, how do we do beans? Like, what is, what's the method, you know, like, do you, what do you do? Do you scrape them? And like, most beans require a couple of days to do right. Like, you don't, you don't just cook beans, like, in 10 minutes, you know what I mean? And I mean that by raw beans, like not, you know, pre-prepared canned bean or whatever. Anyway, I find that hilarious. They're just like, I'm just gonna buy beans. They have no idea what to do with them.
[14:36.000 --> 15:06.000]  I recorded nine days ago with Snell and boy, does that seem like a long time ago. I forget if I told this. So the two nearest, there's a couple nearby places, but we have a place called the Bruno Brothers. Sounds a little bit like yours. It's small, family owned. There's a couple locations here in the city. As you might guess from the name, definitely an Italian slant. You know, it's the type of place where like the deli counter has like half the deli counter is like your usual staples, you know, provolone.
[15:06.000 --> 15:36.000]  Cheese, Swiss cheese, American cheese, ham, roast beef. And then the other entire half is prosciutto. Perfect. Sounds lovely. It's just like the widest variety. Like, I can't believe there's this much prosciutto.
[15:36.000 --> 16:02.000]  It's like they're stocked on pasta, like right up to the edge of the shelf, you know, like just tons of pasta. And it's like the stuff that they're out of is just weird. Like, whereas like I went in and thinking like, hey, I should just buy like, you know, just get like a bag of pasta. And I was like, yeah, I'll probably end up with all the weird stuff, you know, the weird, the weird, the weird pasta. And it all tastes to say, you know, there's no such thing as bad tasting pasta, but like the weird shapes that you never buy.
[16:02.000 --> 16:06.000]  Yeah. People are like, what is orecchiette? I don't understand this.
[16:06.000 --> 16:12.000]  Exactly. Yeah. Honey, I got eight boxes of shells.
[16:12.000 --> 16:20.000]  There was a lot of lasagna, like lasagna noodles. There was a lot of them because everybody's like, oh, pasta. Great. Lasagna. Oh, shoot.
[16:20.000 --> 16:26.000]  Yeah, because that's one. You can't just heat up a jar of sauce or, you know, just pour some olive oil on it or something.
[16:26.000 --> 16:34.000]  I mean, you could, but yeah, it's going to be a little weird. But they're fully stocked of pasta. It's just bizarre what they're out of, you know.
[16:34.000 --> 16:46.000]  No, you know. But, you know, the way that they're doing it here in the city, too, is and it works out great, is they are managing the occupancy of the stores.
[16:46.000 --> 16:47.000]  Oh, interesting.
[16:47.000 --> 16:57.000]  I think to Bruno's, I asked the guy, he said they're trying to limit to 25 customers at a time, and then the line is just outside the door.
[16:57.000 --> 17:06.000]  And they're doing the same thing at Trader Joe's now, too, which was a madhouse previously. I think I talked to Snell about this, but it creates the illusion.
[17:06.000 --> 17:18.000]  And I just wonder how many people don't know that that's what Trader Joe's is doing, is severely limiting the number of people in the store so that it's easy to maintain six feet of distance and there's no line at the checkouts.
[17:18.000 --> 17:25.000]  Whereas a week and a half ago, it was a madhouse and you couldn't even get in the door, you know, and it was like shoulder to shoulder inside.
[17:25.000 --> 17:32.000]  So I just wonder how many people are like cruising by Trader Joe's, see that there's like 30 people outside and they're like, nope.
[17:32.000 --> 17:33.000]  Yeah.
[17:33.000 --> 17:43.000]  Whereas it's actually not bad at all. It's actually better than Trader Joe's usually is at like 5 p.m. on a regular normal time weekday.
[17:43.000 --> 17:46.000]  Right. Yeah, exactly.
[17:46.000 --> 18:03.000]  Well, anyway, we're holding up. And Jonas is on spring break, too, and I think like the period between when his school shut down and spring break seemed really half-assed on the remote schooling, like the one day he had like 20 minutes of math, five minutes of quote unquote health class.
[18:03.000 --> 18:09.000]  And then that was it. And it was like, yeah, back to Animal Crossing.
[18:09.000 --> 18:21.000]  Exactly. I mean, you know, it's the same thing over here. They gave like they gave our kid a lot of my older kid. She's in school and my kids just in preschool. So he's he's living the life.
[18:21.000 --> 18:36.000]  But she got a lot of home work, like a home packet, you know, like, hey, you could download this digital packet or whatever. I do this work and we printed it out diligently and, you know, put it in a binder and all that stuff.
[18:36.000 --> 18:49.000]  And she's like, no, I don't want to do it. And we're like, on one hand, yeah, I mean, she should do it and we're making her do a little bit of it. But on the other hand, I'm like, you know, I don't blame you. I mean, you're this grade is over for you, essentially.
[18:49.000 --> 18:57.000]  You know, like that was that was it. You're not going to go back really into this section of your grade. You know what I mean?
[18:57.000 --> 19:10.000]  I think she may come back on the other half of the semester, and into that, but as far as this report card grades, right at this, like, you know, this, this period is done for you. So what does this matter? Like, we're gonna do it.
[19:10.000 --> 19:22.000]  And then like, the way we the way my wife and I thought about it, we talked about it. And I guess the agreement that we came to amongst ourselves was, it's good, we need to make sure that we do a selection of it so that she understands the concepts, right.
[19:22.000 --> 19:36.000]  But we're not gonna, I'm not gonna sit there and make her do 70 pages of, you know, back to back, front and back work pages, when nobody's gonna care about them, look at them or wonder ever if she did them, you know what I mean? Like, it's just not gonna happen.
[19:36.000 --> 19:51.000]  So at this, we just basically decided on hey, if we can get the concepts down, and we think she understands these concepts that they're trying to teach her, we're gonna be that's, that's good for us, you know, the rest of it is just trying not to go nuts. I think most of our concentration is on that.
[19:51.000 --> 20:05.000]  It's is hard. All right, let me take a break. It's a good time as our first sponsor. It's perfect timing. It is our good friends at Yes, please. Coffee. It's a coffee subscription service. You spell it.
[20:05.000 --> 20:27.000]  Y-E-S-P-L-Z. That's the gimmick. Yes, please. And they have an amazing domain name. Yes, please. Y-E-S-P-L-Z.coffee. Oh my God, what could be better? Yes, please.coffee. Look, they think that the best cup of coffee you ever drink should come right from your own kitchen.
[20:27.000 --> 20:40.000]  You don't have to miss the fact that you can't go to a coffee shop anymore. You don't have to miss it. You can make not just pretty good coffee. You can make great coffee. I can't cook for crap, but I can make a hell of a cup of coffee at home.
[20:40.000 --> 20:55.000]  And I'm doing it with Yes, please beans. Since most of us are stuck making our own coffee at home these days, there's never been a better time to get your beans delivered. The crew at Yes, please sources and roast some of the finest stuff from all over the world.
[20:55.000 --> 21:07.000]  They change it up every week and they deliver it to your door. Whole bean coffee delivered weekly, fortnightly, monthly, or just whenever you need it. And you can pause or cancel anytime, no hassle.
[21:07.000 --> 21:21.000]  I love these guys. One of the co-founders, Tony Canesny, everybody knows him as Tonks. Well, it used to be Tonks Coffee. They used to sponsor the show way back in the day before they got acquired by a bigger company.
[21:21.000 --> 21:29.000]  And his other co-founder, Sumi Ali, they're veterans of coffee's, quote unquote, third wave scene. They are fanatical about making great coffee.
[21:29.000 --> 21:43.000]  One of the things I love about the Yes, please mixes is it's not just like, oh, they find this one bean from Guatemala and then that's this week's shipment. Their stuff usually is like a cocktail of beans from all over the place.
[21:43.000 --> 21:55.000]  I know I forget where I should have brought the bag with me down here to record, but the batch I just got two days ago, yesterday, day before, is from seven different varieties of coffee.
[21:55.000 --> 22:06.000]  And these mad geniuses, they figure out how much to put in. It's a couple from Ethiopia, two from Costa Rica. I forget where the others are from. Mix them all together in the right amount.
[22:06.000 --> 22:20.000]  It is absolutely delicious. I literally just finished my pot of coffee, my morning pot of coffee, right as we were starting the show. Now I'm all out right here, but I'm going to make more as soon as we're done recording.
[22:20.000 --> 22:33.000]  I'm going through coffee like a fiend. I don't know why. I have no idea why, but I'm drinking coffee like a fiend while I'm housebound and having it delivered to the door is the absolute best.
[22:33.000 --> 22:43.000]  These guys believe in great coffee at home, and it's just great. And they have all sorts. They ship with a zine, a print zine. It's amazing, very fun.
[22:43.000 --> 22:52.000]  Once a month, a big issue, and then they have a little weekly thing that gets us an insert when you get your coffee every day or every week, whatever you get it.
[22:52.000 --> 23:02.000]  Anyway, I recommend this coffee wholeheartedly, even if they weren't sponsoring. They sponsored my site last week and the week before. They're sponsoring a podcast this week.
[23:02.000 --> 23:11.000]  This was actually in the works before this whole thing went down. It is complete serendipity that this sponsorship coincides with the need to get stuff delivered to your house.
[23:11.000 --> 23:19.000]  But this is the way to do it. I love this coffee. If they weren't sponsoring it and you said, where should I get coffee? I would tell you right now. Go to Yes, please. Coffee.
[23:19.000 --> 23:32.000]  Go to Yes, please. Coffee. And because they are sponsoring, they've got a promo code. Fireball5. That's F-I-R-E-B-A-L-L and then the digit five.
[23:32.000 --> 23:38.000]  Because if you use that code at checkout, you get five dollars off your first shipment.
[23:38.000 --> 23:48.000]  They have two sizes of bags that you can get every week, every other week, whenever you want it. I've upgraded. I just upgraded from the smaller one to the bigger one because like I said, I'm going through it like a fiend.
[23:48.000 --> 24:00.000]  And I really recommend it wholeheartedly. If you're at home wondering how the hell you can get some good coffee and how to make it, go to Yes, please. Coffee. And remember that code, Fireball5. Love these guys. Sign up for their coffee.
[24:00.000 --> 24:12.000]  And by the way, I checked with them fully operational during this saga. They've got a small crew. They're maintaining distance and they're shipping coffee out. There's no problem with that.
[24:12.000 --> 24:27.000]  I had a fear for when their sponsorship was running last week. I was like, hey, wait a second. I should check with Tonks and make sure they're actually sending this out before I tell everybody how much I love their coffee.
[24:27.000 --> 24:36.000]  And you should go sign up. But they're fully operational. And I just got a bag of beans the other day.
[24:36.000 --> 24:55.000]  Oh, man. How about Amazon? Are you ordering stuff from Amazon? Amazon, I realize, is doing phenomenal because everybody has to get stuff delivered. But there's no better sign that the world is not right than the way that Amazon has gotten weird.
[24:55.000 --> 25:07.000]  You know, I think in the ways that are right where they're prioritizing stuff that pertains to this situation as and stuff that is not essential is getting delayed.
[25:07.000 --> 25:21.000]  Like I ordered a USB adapter the other day and it's in stock. It's not like out of stock. It's in stock. And it's estimated delivery is April 21st.
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.000]  Which is a month.
[25:25.000 --> 25:39.000]  Yeah. I mean, everything you said is true. It's like a canary in a coal mine type situation or a leading indicator or whatever phrase you want to apply to it. Everything is severely jacked up.
[25:39.000 --> 25:54.000]  On a side note, by the way, not to enhance your sponsorship, but I do use like Guess Please as well. And I subscribed to Tonks before they went to Blue Bottle. And then when Blue Bottle bought them, I kept using them.
[25:54.000 --> 26:04.000]  I added a couple Blue Bottle blends to my rotation. But then I got tired of Blue Bottle and so I left. But then when Tony launched Guess Please, I resubscribed and I got a bag waiting for me.
[26:04.000 --> 26:15.000]  And I think I have, and this is more of a personal taste thing, definitely not a freshness thing. I think I've disliked one of their blends over the past year or whatever, you know, that have been getting here however long.
[26:15.000 --> 26:24.000]  Because I think I subscribed right away when they launched. And I think I disliked one blend. Everything else, their taste is amazing. Perfect taste. Anyhow, I thought I'd mention it.
[26:24.000 --> 26:36.000]  I didn't even know that. That's complete serendipity. The other thing I will say, and I enjoy this about Guess Please, is there's a lot of variety week to week. It's not the same.
[26:36.000 --> 26:43.000]  Yeah, you'll get a light South American blend one week and then like a dark African blend the next week.
[26:43.000 --> 26:54.000]  Whereas other coffee subscription services I've tried, especially Blue Bottle after the merger, sort of centralized on a Blue Bottle taste, which wasn't bad.
[26:54.000 --> 26:58.000]  Yeah, it's sort of acidic and kind of medium bright.
[26:58.000 --> 27:02.000]  Yeah, exactly. That's how I would describe it. Medium bright.
[27:02.000 --> 27:15.000]  Yeah. Anyhow, so the Amazon thing, this idea that some things are essential and some things not, I get it, right? I mean, it's easy to see that, yeah, sure. Okay, cool. Right.
[27:15.000 --> 27:26.000]  Somebody's ordering food stuff or medical supplies. Let's bump those up the list. On the surface of it, you could probably make the top 10% of those decisions very easily.
[27:26.000 --> 27:37.000]  It's when it gets down into the longer tail that you start to be curious about it. And like a lot of other people, obviously, I've been ordering a ton of stuff on Amazon.
[27:37.000 --> 27:46.000]  I mean, we do order stuff on Amazon, but I've been doing a few things lately. There were some areas of my house that I hadn't gotten prepped completely.
[27:46.000 --> 27:59.000]  Like, go bag stuff and keep around stuff for just general preparedness, right? And you could see all of those supplies getting really thin and the delivery times creeping out and all that stuff.
[27:59.000 --> 28:20.000]  But if you order a wide variety of stuff, it does start to become very curious. And just the, I don't know, the journalist or tech curio person in me is really intrigued by how they decide what exactly gets shifted.
[28:20.000 --> 28:33.000]  Right? Like what? Okay, so you ordered tweezers. And okay, those are sort of medical. So those come on time. But if you order like nose hair trimmers, it's like, hey, nobody needs to turn my nose hairs right now. Calm down.
[28:33.000 --> 28:45.000]  Like, you'll be alright. Those don't get, you know what I mean? Like, it's really weird. Like, you're like, where's the, okay, how do they decide? Some things, as I said, very easy, right? Like, oh, you know, we're ordering child's Tylenol, right?
[28:45.000 --> 28:56.000]  No, ship it out right now. Like, get it to them. It's quite possible they may have a kid and especially if the kid has, you know, an illness or whatever, everybody's very concerned. We want to make sure that medicine gets there as fast as possible.
[28:56.000 --> 29:08.000]  And same thing with, you know, other things like food and whatnot. But then as you get in the long tail, like, you know, how do you decide like, okay, nail clippers, not a big deal, you know, maybe we'll shift those down the line.
[29:08.000 --> 29:22.000]  But then, you know, oh, a bread proofing basket, does that come right away because it's related to food? Or does it get delayed because it's like, you could make bread in the oven, you don't need a proofing basket, you know what I mean? It's a weird one. It's interesting.
[29:22.000 --> 29:44.000]  Interesting computer science question. And even the USB adapter that I ordered that's coming April 21. So at the end of the week, I just posted, I forget even the context of it, but posted a link to an anchor USB-A to USB-C adapter.
[29:44.000 --> 29:54.000]  Oh, it was in the context of all the stuff I'm reviewing that only has, that's right, that all, you know, we'll get to this stuff, the MacBook Air and the new iPad Pro, they all only have USB-C ports.
[29:54.000 --> 30:09.000]  And if you need to plug anything with that has a hardwired USB-A cable, then you need an adapter. This is my favorite adapter. I linked to it. And then I don't know if it was, I don't think it's because of me, but it's sold out.
[30:09.000 --> 30:32.000]  And then somebody, you know, and I went looking for like, well, what looks similar, you know, because like, one of the things you need with a USB-C to USB-A adapter is you need one that's not too wide, because the ports on the MacBooks are kind of close to each other, you know, and I've seen some adapters, where they can be too close, and then you can't use the other port.
[30:32.000 --> 30:51.000]  But like I said, there's one that looked like a good alternative. It was a color match for the, you know, for the different shades of aluminum that Apple has. Looks nice and small. It's even smaller than the Anker one. And like I said, it's in stock, but it's not delivering until April 21.
[30:51.000 --> 31:15.000]  Again, life saving? No. But like work from a homing, and of course, there's a gazillion of them. So if you really need one to do your work, because now you're, you know, doing zoom or whatever for meetings, and you have a cable that you have to convert because now you need you need this thing to actually like, get your camera or your microphone or whatever hooked up, you can find one from somebody.
[31:15.000 --> 31:27.000]  But it just seems like that in a sense that is important to people, you know what I mean? Like getting a, you know, being able to work from home is important. And I realize it's not as important as having medicine.
[31:27.000 --> 31:46.000]  The other thing I saw today, and of course it sold out, of course it is, but it just hadn't occurred to me, because knock on wood, you know, here, all three of us, you know, no signs of any sickness or illness at all. But I was reading this heartbreaking story.
[31:46.000 --> 31:59.000]  Hopefully he's going to be all right. Doesn't seem, you know, he's not in hospital, but Jessica Lustig, who's a, like a managing editor for the New York Times Magazine, her husband has COVID-19.
[31:59.000 --> 32:14.000]  And she just wrote this, I linked it before we started recording, but she just had this terrific essay for the New York Times Magazine this weekend, just like, just sort of a first person, what it's like dealing with a really sick husband.
[32:14.000 --> 32:35.000]  And, you know, I'm like, riveting, really good writing, really just, wow, this is really eye opening. And then it's like two thirds down, it's like she mentions that like their friends, like when their friends know what they're going through, and one of their friends spotted a bottle of Advil at a thing and bought it for them and dropped it off, because you can't get it.
[32:35.000 --> 32:46.000]  And I'm like, wait, you can't get Advil and Tylenol? And then it's like, and I asked Amy, and she's like, oh, yeah, everybody's sold out. And I'm like, oh, shit. And I'm like, well, of course they are. You know, it makes sense.
[32:46.000 --> 32:57.000]  And that's what they tell you. If you do come down with it, and you just have a mild case, you're supposed to actually take like some kind of mix of both, like you alternate a little Tylenol, a little Advil, keeps your fever down, helps with the aches and pains.
[32:57.000 --> 33:12.000]  Right, yeah, every couple hours, yeah. But you just, so of course they're sold out, you know, but it's like, I'm 47 years old, and every time I've ever been in a drug store in my life, there's 7000 bottles of ibuprofen.
[33:12.000 --> 33:15.000]  Extra strength, 200, 400, 800, yeah, all of it.
[33:15.000 --> 33:18.000]  House brand, Tylenol brand, the other brand.
[33:18.000 --> 33:21.000]  There's usually so many, you can't decide which one to buy.
[33:21.000 --> 33:27.000]  Right. And it's like, wait, do I like capsules or caplets?
[33:27.000 --> 33:41.000]  It reminds me of this special. It was so precious. This special came at just the right time. I mean, everybody should watch it now. I mean, Netflix was, I guess, down today, but when Netflix comes back up, everybody should watch this Netflix special by Ronnie Chang.
[33:41.000 --> 33:55.000]  It's a comedian named Ronnie Chang who, he was in Crazy Rich Asians, he plays the a-hole brother-in-law or nephew, I can't remember what the relationship is, but he has a Netflix standup, a standup special that's amazing.
[33:55.000 --> 34:02.000]  And one of the things he talks about in one of the sort of segments or bits that he has is how plentiful everything is in America.
[34:02.000 --> 34:11.000]  And he says, there's just so much stuff, you know, in America. It's like, you go get takeout and they're like, here, have 50 napkins, have 100 napkins.
[34:11.000 --> 34:25.000]  There's so many napkins everywhere, right? And, you know, I'm not doing it justice so people should watch it, but he's just talking, he's like, America's just, the airspace over America is just Amazon Prime boxes bumping into one another, right?
[34:25.000 --> 34:42.000]  And he talks about the speed of shipping on Amazon and how people have gradually acclimated and they're like, you know, Amazon Prime now, you know, I want it now, I don't want it in two weeks.
[34:42.000 --> 34:59.000]  Oh, you know, like two days, God, I want it right now, like today, tonight, put it in my hand, you know what I mean? And it just, it is a very interesting thing, you know, how big of a deal everybody finds it, which is, it's normal.
[34:59.000 --> 35:16.000]  I'm not singling anybody out that notices this stuff and feels it because it becomes a fabric of a reality so quickly, but it's just wild how quickly we are like, oh, wow, Amazon can't deliver it for two weeks. And it's like used to be to order something, you know, like, oh, it's gonna be shipped next month. Awesome.
[35:16.000 --> 35:31.000]  Now we expect it tomorrow, you know, and things going back to what would even be considered regularly very quick shipping times is like, what is happening? You know, it's just wild how quickly we get used to it.
[35:31.000 --> 35:54.000]  I ordered something, you know, back, back in the old days. I forget what it was just some random thing. And I thought of it like really late at night. I mean, like 1130 at night, like while I was ready to like, put all my devices away and just tune out and watch some TV and I was like, I'll order this.
[35:54.000 --> 36:12.000]  And then like, the doorbell rang and it was like dropped off at like nine in the morning. It's like, wow, is that even possible? Right, right. How is that wild? That is it's too now, you know, well, those were the old days. Yeah, I didn't know Netflix was down today.
[36:12.000 --> 36:34.000]  Yeah, apparently, they had some large outage. I don't know if it's been rectified as of this recording or not. My team's on it. But I got a lot of things going on. So I wasn't tracking that individual thing. I did see it went down, which, obviously, at the on a given any given day, that's news. But right now, sort of everybody's lifeline to me, you know, let me watch something to take my mind off things. So we're paying attention.
[36:34.000 --> 36:50.000]  Yeah, we I can't help but think that it was related to the increased demand we watched. I think we've got the that the comedy special you're talking about. I think that's actually on my my whatever Netflix calls it watch list or whatever.
[36:50.000 --> 37:06.000]  Yeah. Because the comedy specials I like watching movies, Amy thinks movies are too long late at night lately. And so usually I wait for her to fall asleep. Yeah, yeah, well, yeah, you get 20 minutes to do it. They're asleep. And you're like, well, I've already seen this 10 times.
[37:06.000 --> 37:32.000]  But but with all of the talk shows on hiatus, like we're big Seth Meyers fans. We like the Colbert Show, too. But Seth Meyers is like our jam. But even like John Oliver's probably off now. And it you know, Bill Maher, I guess is off. I don't know. He was, you know, I don't know how, you know, unless they're going to do it without an audience. I don't know what they're going to do.
[37:32.000 --> 37:48.000]  So Netflix comedy specials have been our like mutual, you know, like the overlap of the Venn diagram of what do we want to watch tonight on the couch. So we were watching the Leslie Jones Netflix special.
[37:48.000 --> 38:07.000]  So number one, I know the strategy of it. If we want to go meta, I know the strategy of Netflix throwing tons of money at comedy specials because it there's so much even even if it's a lot of money from the comedian's perspective.
[38:07.000 --> 38:30.000]  It's so little money compared to original dramas. You know, in terms of what Netflix pays out of pocket, you know, like just putting a totally aces crew into a theater to record a standup special is so much less expensive than shooting 10 episodes of a top tier drama.
[38:30.000 --> 38:42.000]  And they're evergreen, right? That these comedy specials, you know, people watch comedy specials five years from now, six years, 10 years from now. You know, if it's funny, it's funny.
[38:42.000 --> 39:00.000]  And so it's great, great content. You know, I mean, HBO obviously originated this back in the day, but HBO back in the day would have like, you know, like four comedy specials a year. Now it's like Netflix. It's like you can't even keep up even to housebound. It's hard to keep up with all the comedy specials.
[39:00.000 --> 39:12.000]  But anyway, we're watching the Leslie Jones one, which was really good and kind of needed. It's one that I would recommend giving it more than five minutes because you kind of have to warm up to.
[39:12.000 --> 39:28.000]  I did, at least I had to kind of warm up to it and kind of get into the vibe that she was kind of creating. It's a little very different, very different in a lot of ways, very autobiographical and very honest and a little bit less jokey.
[39:28.000 --> 39:44.000]  But anyway, it was crapping out all the time. We were getting like a weird error that never happens with Netflix. And then there were whole stretches of it where we were getting what was either only 480p or whatever the digital equivalent of 480p was.
[39:44.000 --> 40:03.000]  I mean, really, really pixely. And I could even hear the audio was not as good. Amy was, you know, but it's a comedy special. So it's sort of like, you know, I mean, people used to listen to comedy records, you know, so if there's anything where the video degrading is still a-okay to just keep watching, a comedy special is it.
[40:03.000 --> 40:25.000]  Right. Yeah. You just kind of let it ride. Right. And they were doing that on purpose. They were throttling and YouTube as well. And a lot of other video, major video platforms have been intentionally throttling in order to stay up, you know, and ease the load on broadband backbones.
[40:25.000 --> 40:35.000]  Yeah, I was really curious. And I know that Westworld is not Game of Thrones. Who knows what the hell would happen if Game of Thrones was still on. But I'm a Westworld fan.
[40:35.000 --> 40:45.000]  And when I watched Sunday night, I was like, don't crash, don't crash. And I know that they've got great tech because they've got the BAM media from the baseball.
[40:45.000 --> 40:57.000]  Yeah. The back, you know, they used to be garbage. I mean, back when they first started trying to digitally stream Game of Thrones, it was just like their server just went up in a puff of smoke.
[40:57.000 --> 41:10.000]  And then they like partnered with the BAM media that was originated with Major League Baseball. And then Disney, you know, smartly was like, you guys seem to know what the hell you're doing. We're going to buy you.
[41:10.000 --> 41:27.000]  No, we'll be partners. And then they're like, this is working great. We'll just buy you. And I think I mentioned it was now, but that's why Disney Plus has had such a smooth launch is that they've got either the best or the second best technology in the game next to Netflix.
[41:27.000 --> 41:42.000]  But I mean, oh, man, that was talk about it. So I can't remember the last time Netflix had any hiccups for me. And no surprise. You know, again, again, you know, I'm not complaining. It's just like with the, you know, four month delivery for a USB adapter.
[41:42.000 --> 41:49.000]  I'm not delivering. It's magic. I mean, imagine if this fiasco had happened 15 years ago. What the hell would we be doing?
[41:49.000 --> 42:07.000]  Right. You know, in a lot of ways, it's as bad as this is and as tragic as it is. I mean, people are dying. So, you know, I laugh and we're cracking jokes about stuff, but there's, you know, it's a genuine worldwide tragedy.
[42:07.000 --> 42:26.000]  In some ways, though, man, oh, man, if it were going to happen, if there's going to be a global pandemic, it's better to have come now than before we had a lot of this infrastructure powered by the internet, both for entertainment and for the deliveries. And, you know, it is better now.
[42:26.000 --> 42:51.000]  And I think there's, I remember too that, and I think there is one of the writers on our site who's very thoughtful about this stuff, Josh Kunstein wrote a piece about social media and how much less performative it is at the moment. You know, A, people can't go anywhere. So they can't stand in front of, you know, Niagara Falls or in the Bahamas and take pictures of themselves in a bikini, right? Like they can't do that.
[42:51.000 --> 43:05.000]  So it's a lot less performative at the moment. And it turns out that there is still a backbone of that, that is about people communicating, that is about people, you know, with all the caveats of the platforms themselves, you know, having been irresponsible in many ways.
[43:05.000 --> 43:17.000]  It's just right now social media is actually pretty good, I guess, for lack of a better term, you know, the people in it and the content and the communication aspects of it, the kind of societal interaction.
[43:17.000 --> 43:35.000]  And I also, I mean, that is, I think, a lot of the interpersonal interactions like that are happening on networks like Facebook or are happening in groups on WhatsApp or heck even iMessage, you know, groups where people are sort of bolstering one another and talking and sharing about what they're going through and all that.
[43:35.000 --> 43:48.000]  Both family and, you know, family close friend groups. I think Twitter is an interesting case because it's not so much that you're going to go on there and commiserate with your brother, aunts, uncles or close friends.
[43:48.000 --> 44:11.000]  But it does offer a sort of, you know, it's, I've argued for years and years, I think I wrote my first piece about this in like 2000, like 10 or 11 or sometime back then, but it was basically that once we had a real time channel of constant continuous information that was available to us, we could never do without it again.
[44:11.000 --> 44:27.000]  So even if Twitter, the company went under, or even if they screwed up so bad that somebody had to just step in and do something very similar in a different way, whatever, that particular fire hose would need to exist. It's like an API for life, right?
[44:27.000 --> 44:43.000]  Like that's what Twitter is. It's an enormous amount of information, much of it total crap, you know, much of it inflammatory or unhelpful, but also a lot of it useful, informative or neutral, right?
[44:43.000 --> 45:02.000]  Neutral for now, but vital to one person or another. And that kind of stream of information, just like an API that delivers you a bunch of information, then you filter out, you know, the particular chunks of it you want, you know, that utility of Twitter is kind of showing itself off right now.
[45:02.000 --> 45:25.000]  Because we are unable to rely, I'm speaking of the United States in this instance, because I do believe it's important to acknowledge globally, the situations vary widely, right? But again, the United States right now, we're unable to rely on a lot of the information that's coming from our leadership about the spread, containment, mitigation, and treatment of the virus, right?
[45:25.000 --> 45:53.000]  And the disease that results. And Twitter offers an immediate and virulent counter to misinformation or false information. Of course, there's plenty of misinformation hosted there, too. But think about it in the days when you all you had was the news networks. And hopefully you had a Cronkite or somebody who would tell you the truth, or do the reporting and be in your face about what was really going on.
[45:53.000 --> 46:08.000]  And then you had the official word, and that was it, right? Like maybe you'd have people locally who knew a guy who knew a guy, or you'd have an intrepid news reporter in the media who did their job and cracked the case and showed you what was really going on.
[46:08.000 --> 46:23.000]  But you did not have this constant stream of, say, 10 epidemiologists in a big thread going, hey, here's why all of the government's information on this is BS, or here's how they're twisting the information to make it look a way that's advantageous to them.
[46:23.000 --> 46:34.000]  And that sort of immediate real time checks and balances situation, while it can have its caveats, and it can be dangerous at times, I think is very vital at the current moment in our lives.
[46:34.000 --> 46:50.000]  Yeah, it's complicated, right? I mean, that's basically, it's the story of our times. And maybe it's pretentious to pretend that things are complicated now, and they weren't back in the 60s and 70s.
[46:50.000 --> 47:09.000]  I don't want to be glib about it, but at least in terms of knowing what to trust, it is complicated now, because you didn't have choices back then, right? I'm not saying that there weren't problems with the fact that you got Cronkite at six o'clock, and you got your newspaper in the morning or the afternoon.
[47:09.000 --> 47:23.000]  And that was it. And maybe if you were really a news junkie, you got Time magazine delivered every Friday. I'm not saying that there weren't problems with that. There were, but you didn't have a choice. There wasn't anything, what are you going to do?
[47:23.000 --> 47:42.000]  What, call the Associated Press and get an AP terminal, put it in your home? There wasn't much you could do, whereas now you have to be a critical reader, and it's obviously a problem for a lot of people.
[47:42.000 --> 47:55.000]  I mean, and it is bizarre to have a president of the United States giving out completely false information.
[47:55.000 --> 48:07.000]  And this, again, not to get super political about it, but it's undeniable, even if you love the guy, even if you think, well, he made some mistakes, but he's still better than we would have been otherwise.
[48:07.000 --> 48:19.000]  I still stand supported. I don't know what's wrong with you if you think that. But even then, you have to acknowledge that the guy was completely wrong when, like, March 3rd, he was like, we'll be down to zero cases soon.
[48:19.000 --> 48:37.000]  It's like, that was wrong. I mean, there's no other way to put it. If you took him at his word, you had the completely wrong idea of what's going on, and now he's peddling these malaria drugs that maybe, possibly, would be great.
[48:37.000 --> 48:51.000]  Again, if he is right, Jesus Christ, you're never going to hear the end from him. But the president of the United States should not be encouraging people to take drugs that haven't been approved, or even...
[48:51.000 --> 49:08.000]  One of the drugs he's describing is incredibly toxic if taken in the wrong way. And the other one is Z-Pak, which is a pretty standard medicine that's used to treat infections.
[49:08.000 --> 49:21.000]  So it's like a mixture of really obvious stuff that any doctor would be like, yeah, of course we're going to give you a Z-Pak, you know what I mean? And stuff that's potentially incredibly dangerous. It's a toxic blend.
[49:21.000 --> 49:38.000]  Yeah. I mean, I saw there was some couple in the 60s where they saw him yapping about it on Fox News. The guy died, and his wife was in critical condition because he ordered up a bunch of it, and they, I don't know, drank a cupful of it, and, you know, wrong dose.
[49:38.000 --> 49:39.000]  Yeah.
[49:39.000 --> 49:43.000]  I mean, I laugh, but this should not be coming from the president.
[49:43.000 --> 49:48.000]  It's a macabre sort of laughter, you know what I mean? It's just, man, it's just something.
[49:48.000 --> 50:02.000]  But on the other hand, just a small thing, but it's like a friend of the show, friend of everybody, Ben Thompson, has been on this where Ben over in Taiwan was, you know, A, he had his eye on this thing very, very early.
[50:02.000 --> 50:10.000]  Got to give him credit for that. Has no trust in the Chinese government's word on this. Didn't believe a word they were saying. Turns out, you know, that attitude was right.
[50:10.000 --> 50:19.000]  Taiwan is really under control. You know, the restaurants are open, I think schools are open, but people go out. You know what people wear? They wear masks.
[50:19.000 --> 50:28.000]  And Ben was on the thing, you know, was on team, hey, don't be using masks unless you're sick. Masks are really only for you.
[50:28.000 --> 50:38.000]  If you think you have it to keep you from spreading it, don't wear a mask just to keep from getting it because now, you know, the medical professionals can't get their hands on it.
[50:38.000 --> 50:47.000]  And that was the expert line, but it turns out that's actually not really right. The mask, wearing a mask even when you don't have it actually does help keep you get it.
[50:47.000 --> 50:52.000]  And you can get it through your mouth in ways that they were saying originally you couldn't.
[50:52.000 --> 50:58.000]  And again, I don't have any masks in the house. I'm not wearing masks when I go out. I'm not encouraging it.
[50:58.000 --> 51:15.000]  But the truth is there is something to it, you know, and that's the sort of thing that I feel like critical reading of stuff on Twitter and among other places, but Twitter is certainly the one that I'm thinking of.
[51:15.000 --> 51:21.000]  You can pick up on stuff like that that you might not get just by reading the front page of The New York Times.
[51:21.000 --> 51:34.000]  Right. Yeah. You're going to get the counter narrative that says, hey, I actually live in this space or I live in a region that has been masking forever, which, of course, you know, many regions in Asia do.
[51:34.000 --> 51:44.000]  Masks have become a part of life. And contrary to popular belief, are not always or not primarily even worn by sick people.
[51:44.000 --> 51:53.000]  They're worn by people who go out in public who are healthy. But in fact, there are other subtleties attached to it that only people in the region would understand.
[51:53.000 --> 52:00.000]  Like masking is actually seen as a sign of respect and care for others. Right.
[52:00.000 --> 52:09.000]  You know, it's one of the reasons Japan was able to flatten its curve so harshly is in addition to a strong culture of like, hey, you know, the government says this is important to us.
[52:09.000 --> 52:19.000]  OK, let's play along and let's obey. But then they also have a strong culture of service to others.
[52:19.000 --> 52:29.000]  So where they care, it's a communal care culture where if somebody is inconveniencing somebody else, they would treat that as unfathomable.
[52:29.000 --> 52:33.000]  They do their best to avoid it. Right.
[52:33.000 --> 52:41.000]  And of course, the biggest thing you could do to inconvenience or harm another individual, of course, is like transmitted disease and potentially kill them.
[52:41.000 --> 52:48.000]  And so that that particular aspect of it was built into the culture. It's not so much built in here.
[52:48.000 --> 53:04.000]  It's, you know, there is a self-deterministic attitude to the U.S. that I think has that definitely slows any response to these things when it involves personal sacrifice, you know, as simple as staying in and not going out and doing your normal routine.
[53:04.000 --> 53:16.000]  We saw this sort of like the spring breakers and all of that stuff, but certainly with older folks as well who are reluctant to acknowledge that the distancing and self-quarantining might help.
[53:16.000 --> 53:21.000]  So it's just a different, you know, you see the you see the curves, you see the charts, you see the numbers.
[53:21.000 --> 53:37.000]  But then Twitter and other platforms like that give you access to people who are living in, you know, in these regions or in a particular area of expertise that can give you more depth and understanding, which then helps you, you know, in some ways, just the knowledge is better.
[53:37.000 --> 53:43.000]  You know, it makes it easier to do these things. A lot of mental health stuff going on and just knowledge helps a lot of times.
[53:43.000 --> 53:57.000]  Hey, speaking of masks, you just sent this to me breaking news while we're recording. Tim Cook has tweeted, proud to share we've been able to source 10 million masks for the U.S. and millions more for the hardest hit regions in Europe.
[53:57.000 --> 54:03.000]  Our ops teams are helping to find and purchase masks from our supply chain in coordination with governments around the world.
[54:03.000 --> 54:06.000]  Good for Apple.
[54:06.000 --> 54:14.000]  And again, you know, not to get too political about it, but it's of all the things to be short of, man, that just seems like something.
[54:14.000 --> 54:31.000]  And again, it doesn't seem like we should keep a stockpile ready for a global pandemic, but it seems like we should have switches ready to flip with a week or two notice to get, you know, it just doesn't seem like we should be struggling to have masks.
[54:31.000 --> 54:37.000]  The U.S. in particular should not be struggling for goddamn tests.
[54:37.000 --> 54:43.000]  You know, good for Apple, good for other companies that are contributing.
[54:43.000 --> 54:53.000]  But again, I just don't, it's not right that we're relying on Apple, a computer company, to get 10 million masks to the U.S.
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.000]  The federal government ought to be able to do it.
[54:55.000 --> 55:06.000]  Something has really gone off the rails, and once we're out of this mess, hopefully, you know, it's going to snap us collectively out of the complacency we've obviously developed.
[55:06.000 --> 55:18.000]  I mean, one thing, it's like you could say we were lucky that we didn't have, we in the U.S. weren't hit hard by SARS and a couple of other similar type viruses over the last 20 years.
[55:18.000 --> 55:24.000]  But the countries that were developed, you know, they were ready for this in ways that we weren't.
[55:24.000 --> 55:42.000]  Like the one thing I read was that a whole bunch of countries in Asia, after the SARS epidemic, set up their hospitals with actual, you know, buildings right next door ready for a virus outbreak connected to the hospital,
[55:42.000 --> 55:52.000]  but with entirely different entrances, entirely different HVAC systems, so that the next time something like this would happen.
[55:52.000 --> 56:01.000]  And knowing, you know, whether it was five years away or 10 years away or 20 years away, it was inevitable that they were ready for it.
[56:01.000 --> 56:10.000]  And, you know, in a way that U.S. hospitals clearly are not in terms of, and my heart just, we're just not ready for it.
[56:10.000 --> 56:24.000]  There's somebody, right now, there are people out there in the U.S., especially just New York, you know, the Bay Area's obviously, you know, hit pretty bad, Los Angeles, Southern California.
[56:24.000 --> 56:30.000]  Boston's hit pretty bad. Philly is really coming, Philly is very low right now, knock on wood.
[56:30.000 --> 56:46.000]  But, you know, we're so close to New York, it's kind of amazing to me the discrepancy, given how close we are and how many people I know on a daily basis go between New York and Philly, that that hasn't been more of an issue by this point.
[56:46.000 --> 57:01.000]  But, my God, just going into the regular emergency room in ordinary times is unpleasant, but, my God, if you're going in with symptoms for this, it's like, it's complicated in so many ways.
[57:01.000 --> 57:11.000]  Because, you know, just as a human being, you know that you've got it or you think you've got it because you've got all the symptoms, but you don't want to go in there and get other people sick.
[57:11.000 --> 57:21.000]  You know, somebody who just cut their hand or something like that, you know, just quote unquote normal reasons to go to the emergency room.
[57:21.000 --> 57:30.000]  And yet, you know, countries in Asia are set up for this so that if you, you know, you have it or you think you have it, you can get a test, you can get results, you can go to a special.
[57:30.000 --> 57:38.000]  You don't go in with the regular people who, you know, somebody who dropped something on their foot and thinks they broke a bone in their foot or something like that.
[57:38.000 --> 57:42.000]  You're not sitting there right next to somebody who's got COVID-19.
[57:42.000 --> 57:53.000]  Right. And, you know, at the moment, even if you look at it from the healthcare provider's perspective, I mean, there are already shortages of masks for healthcare workers.
[57:53.000 --> 57:56.000]  You know, if you get those healthcare workers sick, we're all screwed.
[57:56.000 --> 58:11.000]  Right. And it's just crazy. I mean, and you see the pictures, and again, social media really does help bring it to bear, right? And it's like, I saw a picture the other day where, I don't even know where it was, doesn't matter.
[58:11.000 --> 58:27.000]  I'm sure it's a situation echoed coast to coast, but like, because they're so short of masks, the hospital staff, like the nurses, when they're done, they take off their mask and put it in a paper bag with their name on it.
[58:27.000 --> 58:28.000]  Yeah.
[58:28.000 --> 58:44.000]  So that the next, you know, when their next shift starts or the break is over or whatever, they can go take it out of the bag, put the same mask back on, you know, like just really just, you just don't think of that as something that we would encounter in the modern first world, you know?
[58:44.000 --> 58:51.000]  Right. Well, yeah. I mean, there is anything that makes you question your first world status. It's our response to this situation.
[58:51.000 --> 58:52.000]  Yeah.
[58:52.000 --> 58:53.000]  Which sucks.
[58:53.000 --> 58:54.000]  Yeah.
[58:54.000 --> 59:06.000]  Totally. And, you know, not to get, again, not to get political about it, but there is something to be said for manufacturing, you know, that there are certain things that shouldn't be entirely outsourced out of the country.
[59:06.000 --> 59:15.000]  You know, that obviously like mask and ventilator production ought to be something that every country should be able to ramp up production on their own.
[59:15.000 --> 59:27.000]  Just because it's, you know, you can't rely, you know, in an emergency, you can't rely on getting stuff sent over from China or Taiwan or wherever else.
[59:27.000 --> 59:30.000]  Yep. Pretty wild.
[59:30.000 --> 59:49.000]  Let's take a break. And our next sponsor, good friends at Eero. E-E-R-O. I love Eero. Maybe you're at home now and you haven't really worried about your Wi-Fi that much. It was good enough or reached the places you need, but now you're working in a weird corner in your house or something like that.
[59:49.000 --> 59:56.000]  Well, if it's in the back of your mind, maybe you should upgrade your Wi-Fi. Eero is a terrific way to go.
[59:56.000 --> 01:00:07.000]  It is a mesh network. In other words, you set up multiple devices, you connect the main one to where your cable modem or whatever other wherever your Internet comes in, hook that up.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:21.000]  Then throughout your house, strategically place a few other units and Eero will help you based on the square footage, how many floors you have, help you plot out how many you need to really saturate your home with one solid network.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  So you might have three devices to go through your house, but from your phone's perspective or your MacBook's perspective, it just looks like one network, one network name, one password.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  And as you move around the house, it just silently hands off and you wind up with a really, really good Wi-Fi connection all through your house.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  Right now, I'm talking to Matthew over an Eero network. Couldn't be happier. It's really great.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  We used to never get a signal. This is my old house. We've had Eero ever since we moved here, but in my old house, we couldn't get a signal in the basement or not the basement, really, the garage.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  And it always sucked when you're leaving. You're in the car, you're ready to go. It's like, oh, I wanted to download a podcast. Nope, no signal. Well, no problem anymore.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  Whole house, top to bottom, solid signal. It's the Wi-Fi your home deserves.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  They have an all new Eero that starts at just 99 bucks and it sets up in minutes. You just plug it in your modem.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  You plug the other ones around your house and they have a beautiful app that they just updated to an all new rewritten version a couple months ago, about two months ago.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  Always was a great app. Now it's even better, even looks better, but it's really, really easy.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  I mean, within five minutes, you could have this whole thing set up and running. And most of that five minutes is actually just sort of walking up the stairs to go from the bottom to the top.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  It's hard to exaggerate how easy it is to set up an Eero network in your house.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  And it really is. It might be for a long time. Never been more important to have really solid, dependable Wi-Fi in your house.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  You can get yours fixed as soon as tomorrow, maybe by going to Eero dot com slash the talk show.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  That's the the U.R.L. Eero dot com slash the talk show.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  And remember that code, the talk show at checkout and you get free overnight shipping with your order.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  That's Eero dot com slash the talk show with the code, the talk show to get your system delivered free with overnight shipping.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  But you've got to use that U.R.L. to get the offer. Eero dot com slash the talk show. My thanks to them for continuing to support the show.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  Oh, I guess we should go on to actual stuff. We got two products last week. Boy, does that feel that was a week ago, a week ago when we found out about the new Apple products.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  And I know it's the oldest. Everybody keeps saying, my God, days feel like weeks and weeks feel like months, but I cannot believe it was seven days ago when we got these the briefings on these new Apple products.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  The new MacBook Air, primarily new MacBook Air, new iPad pros and a sneak peek tease at the magic keyboard.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  Magical floating iPad over a keyboard that is coming in May. I know the terms.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  I know I don't want to I didn't sign anything, but as a verbal agreement, you know, we in the media were we're not supposed to talk about the actual briefings which were delivered.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  We are allowed to say that they were by video. And so I don't want to you know, I don't want to violate any spirit of the agreement.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  But, you know, suffice it to say, Apple recorded effectively a little 30 minute what might have been maybe not an event, but maybe would have been like little small gathering things like in New York or Cupertino in normal times.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  You know, with slides and present, you know, here's the highlights. You know, this is sort of a typical Apple keynote. And but instead of seeing it in person, we saw it on video.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  Right.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  I reviewed both you, your colleague Brian reviewed the MacBook Air. Have you seen the MacBook Air or did you just do?
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  Yeah, they did. Yeah, they did send me one as well. I'm gonna play with it, but I haven't really done much beyond open it up and and tinkle the keys of it.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  That's about it. I'm gonna play with it more, but I haven't had a chance. I've been busy with this. Our newsrooms pretty crazy right now, as you can imagine.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  And so I kind of focused on the iPad, but I did look at the air and of course the keyboard.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  Keyboard feels great. I mean, my my I'm a huge air fan, right? Like I, I love the air. I do like the thin factor, the thin form factor, nothing in my line of work.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  I mean, it used to be in the old days, I would do like a lot of on laptop video editing or photo editing, especially when I was in a much smaller newsroom and kind of very ad hoc where everybody's kind of doing their own stuff.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.000]  But we have a video team and they're fantastic. And so I really don't do a lot of that on my laptop.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  So the 13 inch MacBook Pro, which is standard issue for, well, what is now Verizon Media, but the standard issue at TechCrunch. That is honestly overkill for me.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  You know, I like it. You know, I like the power. It's really nice to have it when you need it. You know, somebody sends me some weird 3D thing or something I need to crunch or unpack or slice or render in some way.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:57.000]  Great. It's cool. It can do it, but it's not necessary for the most part. And so I've actually been a really big fan of the air for a lot of years now because anything that's slimmer or smaller, that makes my bag lighter, that still gets the job done, which is largely web based these days because I use a lot of web tools, web editing tools, all that stuff.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:10.000]  I'm all for. And so I've loved the air for a very long time. I'm really a big fan. I do love the updates to the look and feel and everything that they've done over the years. It's gotten better.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:23.000]  And the retina certainly was a huge watershed moment. But the keyboard on the air, and I know people like to wax rhapsodic about old Apple keyboards and say how much better life used to be before the chiclet and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  But the old air keyboard was mushy as hell. I don't care who you are. If you're telling me the old air keyboard was great, you're an idiot.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  You mean from the pre-retina era?
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. The pre-retina. I'm not talking about the chiclet version. I'm talking about the old, old version. It was just super. The keys were very unstable. The mushiness came from a couple of things.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:58.000]  One being the keys had a lot of lateral travel. So you could put your finger on it and move it side to side and it would be like ch-ch-ch. And then they were very unstable. So depending on what corner of the key you hit, it would shift in a different direction, which just led to this overall mushiness to it.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  Now, it was still better than the chiclet keyboard. It was still better than the one we had on the MacBooks and stuff like that for a while, but certainly was not the best.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  So for me, getting a MacBook Air with this new keyboard, it's actually very exciting for me as far as the laptop use goes. I think that's a really great combo. Retina on an Air form factor with a keyboard that's stable and firm, but has that full one millimeter of travel. I'm all for it. I think that's a great package for everybody.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  It's hard not to just spend all the time talking about the keyboard because it is the most significant change. Well, it's not the most significant change because Intel has finally gotten their act together with chipsets that fit in that reduced lower thermal form factor.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:08:13.000]  So there's this very serious performance update with the new MacBook Airs that shipped last week, too. And that's good. That is actually good. And it's especially good because you just know it, I know it. I'm recording this podcast right now on a 2015 13-inch MacBook Pro.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  No, 2014. I actually undersold it. It is still a phenomenal machine. What I did in September of 2014 is bought the fastest 13-inch MacBook Pro I could get. I got the biggest SSD, which was, I think it was one terabyte. I actually don't even remember.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  16 gigs of RAM and the 3 gigahertz Core i7 fastest CPU update. Here I am five and a half years later, and it is still a very credible machine. I threw the Geekbench numbers in with my review. It's a little below the air, like on single core.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  But it's, you know, it's in the ballpark, which, you know, and again, Geekbench is not, you know, it's an arbitrary thing. But the ballpark numbers from Geekbench always, that's why I like including them in my reviews, is they, however much they might not exactly measure, say, Adobe Photoshop in particular, or some use case.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  As a ballpark number, they always jibe with my feel. You know, this 2014 machine is still there. Whereas the first round of retina MacBook Airs was just really not that fast.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  And fast enough for now, but it wasn't like the worry is, hey, what if you want to use it for five or six years? And I think that's a totally credible thing to do. I'm a pro, and I buy a new iPhone every freaking year because I'm an idiot.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  But I like to get my Macs up and running, get it, max them out, get them set up just the way I want, and then use them until they feel slow. And the longer it goes, the better.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  And I think that's, you know, for the amount of money that these things cost. You know, upgrade a little bit here and there, and a MacBook Air is $1,300, which in today's market for laptops is premium.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  Even Apple's lowest priced MacBooks, they're at the premium end of the market. $1,000 and up is more than most people spend on a laptop. They should last, and part of lasting is having a processor and GPU performance that's still going to be credible four or five years from now.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  I mean, God only knows how long your typical web page is going to take to load 2025, but you're going to want a beefy CPU. So I don't want to downplay the performance improvements in these new MacBook Airs, but the keyboard is what I want to talk about.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  I thought that has crossed my mind, and I got an interesting email from a reader today, like somebody who said, hey, I've been reading you forever, at least 10 years, don't even remember when I started, never wrote before.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  Just wanted to say I appreciate your reviews this week, and just said that this guy is also a keyboard obsessive, obsesses about external keyboards, cares about keyboards.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  He's like, what's wrong with, you know, why do we do this? And there's obviously two types of people in the world, people who really are really, really, really, really fussy about their keyboards and people who don't really care.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  And they just, they roll your eyes when a keyboard nerd starts going off about, you know, like me this week, I was talking about in my iPad review, I mentioned that I was using this Bluetooth mechanical keyboard, the Keychron K2, and complaining that not just which color mechanical switches, but that they were Gateron instead of Cherry brand brown switches, and they feel a little cheap.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  I mean, there's a lot of people who read that and are rolling their eyes. Those of us who really care, I think, you know, it would be nicer not to care. It would simplify life.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  It's just true with so many things that we obsess about over the years. It would be much nicer if I just couldn't care.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  It's because the keyboard is the physical interface between me and the machine. And I've always loved that bicycle of the mind analogy to computing.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  Like, I really do feel like using computers makes me smarter because I've got like this infinite memory. If I put it in Apple Notes, I can remember it forever because I just always have notes with me and I can look it up, you know.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  So like, effectively, I have like all of my bank account numbers memorized. I couldn't tell it to you right now in this mic, but I could look it up in about 20 seconds by going to a note, right?
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  What an amazing thing. Like 20, 30 years ago, nobody knew what the hell their bank account numbers were, right? I know everything. I know every phone number I need to know.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  You know, I can lose my credit cards, but if I have my phone, I can call the credit card company because I have their numbers.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  The keyboard is like right there at the intersection of me, a mechanical machine made of bones and meat and teeth.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  Right.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  And this thing made of aluminum and silicon and glass.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  Thank you for that visual, by the way.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  Right. Really, we're all just sacks of meat with teeth.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  Yeah, it's pretty much it. You just shove some teeth into a meat sack and you get yourself a human being. No, I know what you mean. I know what you mean.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  I mean, you know, you as a machine are interfacing with another machine. That's the point of contact.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  And there's a feel to it, right? And you know this. I mean, we've always talked about like your dad is a craftsman and there are, you know, if I had been born in another era, maybe I'd be working with my hands making things.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  And there's there's a, you know, it's soothing sometimes just to have something physical in your hands.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  You know, right now I'm just idly playing with my Apple pencil. I'm not writing anything, but it's just a nice object to have in my hands while I talk to you.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  It just feels good. It feels good to have a nice feeling keyboard. And I am a professional writer to some by some measurement.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  I write a lot of words. It feels good to have it feel pleasing to my fingers to move the keys up and down.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  Right. But I can't the thought that I had today and I never really popped into my head before.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  But now that the air has a good keyboard and I really do believe that it is a very good keyboard, it doesn't quite travel as much as the older ones before this whole butterfly fiasco.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  And more travel in general is better up to a certain point. But like the stability that you're talking about is so pleasing.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  And when you go to the older ones and they wiggle around, it feels like, oh, my God, these keys are going to just come flying off.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  If I turn this upside down, they wiggle so much. Right. There's I would say overall, you can quibble about.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  Oh, it would be nice to have had a little more travel or something like that. But it's a really good keyboard.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  It's a very good laptop keyboard. I feel that those of us who care, you know, and at a certain point, it seems very clear that inside Apple,
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  a group that doesn't care so much about feel got to make choices on shipping that butterfly keyboard.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  Right. Like, I don't know. I know. I think Casey lists says he likes the butterfly keyboard on his 12 inch MacBook.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  I know there are people who like it, but they're few. It's hard to find people who say I really like typing on this keyboard.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  There certainly are outnumbered by people who don't. And obviously there are there were people within Apple who in a decision making position thought this is good enough to ship or that they actually liked it.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  Right. Right. So in a sense, for those of us who didn't like the feel of it.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  I think that in a sense, it's possible that we really got lucky that there were profound reliability problems with those keyboards.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  Because, oh, I see what you're saying. Right. Like if they didn't break and cost the company money and raise a big cry about repairability and recycling and everything else.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  Right. Maybe that cadre would have been like, no, people will get used to it.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  Because that's the thing, the thing that really strikes out now that we're and we're not quite entirely in the rearview mirror because the 13 inch MacBook Pro still has the third generation butterfly keyboard.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  And now that the air has the new one, inevitably the new 13 inch MacBook Pro, or if they go to 14 inch, you know, like the way that the 15 inch went to 16.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  And rumors seem to suggest that 13 is going to go to 14, maybe not by increasing the for the footprint, but just by going closer to edge to edge on the lid.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000]  It's obviously going to get that keyboard.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  But I can't help but think because the thing that happened is even the people who don't obsess over the feel of, oh, butterfly switches versus scissor key switches.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  And I like the extra, you know, 10th of a millimeter of travel.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  And I like the sound. I like the sound of this better.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:57.000]  Even the people who roll their eyes at all of that, they expect when they hit the key to get one and only one E to appear on screen.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  Right. When they even the even the least obsessive keyboard user would like a letter to appear once or or or less than two.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  When their thumb hits the space bar, they expect one space to appear in the text editing field they're using and they expect the physical space bar to pop back up.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  Right. Right.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  So all of a sudden, what happened with those butterfly keyboards is that everybody became a keyboard fanatic.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  Everybody went from zero to 100 for everybody, because if it don't work, it don't work.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  Right.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:40.000]  And I I can't you know, I don't know.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  I don't know the back story. I have no inside juice on it.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  You know, as to whether even if the reliability thing hadn't been an issue, would they have spent the effort to to engineer the new scissor key keyboard that fits in these same form factors?
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:13.000]  And they don't quite sit in the same form factors, because if you actually look at the tech specs, the new MacBook Airs are like one millimeter thicker at the thick end of the wedge than the ones that shipped in November 2018.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  And that one millimeter is actually how much more travel there is on the keys.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:27.000]  So it kind of corresponds to if we make that thing a little one millimeter bigger, we can actually use one more millimeter and get a better keyboard in there.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  Would they have done it anyway?
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  I maybe, you know, maybe that that they, you know, within Apple, that even within Apple, there was a well, this isn't the best feeling keyboard in the world, but it's a it's a worthy compromise to ship these things in thinner form factors.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  And we'll keep our keyboard engineers at work and see if we can even come up with something better.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  And it took a couple of years. Who knows?
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:20:04.000]  But I think it's definitely not off the table that if the butterfly keyboards had been as reliable as all Apple keyboards always have been and as anybody should reasonably expect that we might still have them.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000]  Right.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.000]  You know, and and for those of us who care, that's a reasonable assumption to make, to be honest.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000]  Yeah, I do, too.
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:17.000]  And I was really thinking about it from this one very thoughtful email from from a longtime reader.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:31.000]  And the more I thought about it, the more I thought, boy, that seems likely because it just seems, you know, it's, you know, for as big and as much money as Apple has there, they are careful about what they shine their attention on.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:41.000]  You know, and would they have deemed fixing these, quote unquote, fixing these keyboards that weren't broken, that were operating completely as design? Would they have prioritized that?
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000]  I don't know.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:59.000]  Yeah, I I think it's one of those times where you just you just see and when I say cost, I don't want to treat I don't want to see the word cost here as in a negative light, because it's it's really a neutral term.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.000]  But you do see the cost.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:24.000]  You know, put on display here of Apple's policy of making sure that their ideation and creation of their of, you know, their decision making process of creating their devices is not unduly influenced by whatever anybody thinks at that moment in the public.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:35.000]  Like there is a very distinct, you know, auteur driven process that Apple has and has had a lot of success with over the years.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:53.000]  And so you see the cost of it here, because if you had been listening and applying the feedback and the the outcry about the look and feel of these keyboards, you would have been working on a new one before the reliability, you know, aspects came into play.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  Right. You would have been seeing like, Oh, doesn't matter what we think people actually do really dislike the feel of this keyboard.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  And the people that don't care will probably like whatever we put out.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:22.000]  And the people that do care are the most most voice difference and the highest, you know, sometimes the highest impact users, you know, the people that use our product a lot are genuinely more likely to care about, you know, the the way X or Y or Z feels.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  Maybe we should look at the redesign and maybe we should explore blah, blah, blah.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  But given the timeline, it seems pretty clear that they weren't exploring it at all until the reliability issues hit a hit a breaking point.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:40.000]  Yeah. One of the things I did, my son has a MacBook Air retina MacBook Air.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:48.000]  I think it's a year old. I forget. But he has some sort of butterfly keyboard. He's fine with it.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:57.000]  But I had him try the review unit and he agreed, felt better. But the thing he noticed right away and I don't think it's visually obvious at all.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:05.000]  I think the difference is so small that it's for me, at least it's hard to see, but you can feel it is that there's a little more space between the keys.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  Just a little just a little more space between the keys. But it makes it a lot easier just right as you put your fingers on the home road to orient them.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  Just slightly bigger gaps between the keys and therefore a slight reduction in the area. And it's somehow just I don't know.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.000]  It's just like the key caps are smaller. Yeah, that's the way he did that.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:32.000]  Key caps are smaller so that therefore the gaps are slightly bigger. But it's very hard to tell visually.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000]  I think you'd almost need you need to feel it. It's easier to feel than to see.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:49.000]  They just dialed it in just right. And they really took what they had, the basic concept of the retina MacBook Air and just made every little thing that really needed to be better.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.000]  They made it better. All right, let me take a break. Thank our third and final sponsor of the show.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:05.000]  I want to save more time to talk about iPad because I feel like there's more to talk about, which I'll explain on the other end of this, which is Squarespace.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  Hey. We've all got a lot more time on our hands than we used to.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:18.000]  Maybe one of the things on your agenda is creating a new website for you or for somebody you know, or maybe taking an old website.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  Moving it, updating it, modernizing it to a new platform. Squarespace has you covered.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  They have everything from domain name registration to a whole slew of award winning professionally designed templates to a CMS system so that you can add a blog, host a podcast, something like that where you post on a regular basis, do it all through Squarespace.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  Analytics. Who's coming to your site? Where are they coming from? What's your traffic like? They've got you covered.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:25:00.000]  One of the best analytic dashboards I've ever seen, where instead of just throwing a fire hose of numbers and tabs and sidebar items at you, they organize it.

[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  So I'm done with the MacBook Air, honestly talking about my review, said everything I had to say. The keyboard fixed.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  I love the new keyboard, if anything. I actually think it feels slightly better than the 16 inch MacBook Pro.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  I don't know if that's some kind of placebo effect. I think it might just be that I like the physical form factor of the air better.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  It just sort of feels a little I don't know. The keyboard's a little lost on the giant 16 inch thing.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  And whereas the keyboard is like just right on the 13 inch. But if I'm wrong, it's identical.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  You know, it's either it either feels the same as good or better. It's as good as maybe the best keyboard Apple's ever shipped on a laptop in some ways.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  The processors fixed. You've got three options now. Good, better, best. Even the good one is pretty good.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  Everything that was good remains good. Still has it has amazing sound for a MacBook Air.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  Like if you just actually play video through the speakers and they got the price down to $999.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  $899 for education to get a pretty good, credible machine with 256 gigs of storage done. Max done.
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  The thing about the iPad, which I think could fill up any remaining time we're going to spend on this, is in addition to new hardware,
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  they have totally like just like a lightning bolt to iPad OS in the middle of March.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  I've had OS 13.4 now has truly rich system wide trackpad support. Yes.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:44.000]  Literal, literal nowhere. There you go. Somebody had a nine to five max.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  Somebody got a peek at some device running iOS 14 a couple of weeks ago and they're like,
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  hey, it looks like they've got like really serious APIs for trackpad and mouse support in here.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  And everybody's like, oh, that'll be exciting. Hope WWDC hope we learn more about it in June. Hope there is a WWDC.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:04.000]  Can't wait to try it. Maybe I'll run the beta over summer. Can't wait for fall at the very end.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  And here we are at the end of March. And it's shipping as of yesterday.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  Well, yeah. And you can look at that two ways, I guess. Right. You can look at it like, you know, it.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:26.000]  Well, I guess not two ways. It's two interlocking ways. One, it was quite obviously to support the magic keyboard.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  Right. Like that's why the right now. Sure. It works with the you know, with any trackpad that you can attach to the iPad or that you can Bluetooth to it or whatever.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  It works with third party keyboards, yada, yada, yada. It's to support the magic keyboard. Right.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:50.000]  It's to support this accessory that probably has a nice profit margin, but that also seems like a really nice additional keyboard,
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  a better keyboard that takes all of the technology and learnings that they've had from revamping the MacBook keyboards and makes it available to iPad users.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:05.000]  Right. That's why this appeared. However, it is interesting that they were able to develop it and get it all done.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000]  And it only leaked a couple of weeks before they were literally going to drop it.
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:22.000]  So normally when these leaks happen, it's like months out and, you know, somebody got a hold of a piece of software through either a partner or a regulatory thing or whatever.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  And all of a sudden we're seeing, you know, oh, hey, there's hints of X or hints of Y or whatever.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  And so we're like, oh, there's hints of this. That'll be cool if they support it. Oh, no, here it is. It's fully realized. And not only that, it's really cool.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  Like it's different than anything you've seen before. It's not just keyboard and mouse support or it's not just cursor support.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:52.000]  It's a reimagined cursor. It's behavioral. It's deeply integrated. And it's probably one of the better implementations anybody's ever done on a tablet.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:59.000]  You know, it was a nice zero to 100 moment for iOS software, I thought.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:08.000]  And even though whispers of it did leak, I have to say as an overall surprise, this is one of the biggest ones that Apple's pulled off in a while.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:18.000]  Because even with the hint of maybe this fall, there's going to be some sort of quote unquote rich trackpad mouse pointer support for the iPad.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:27.000]  Nobody thought it was coming in 13.4. They completely hid it. Nobody saw the magic keyboard coming.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:37.000]  I guess the information had a story that Apple was working on some sort of thing with a trackpad integrated with a keyboard a couple of weeks ago.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:44.000]  So whispers of it leaked, but not any kind of actual description.
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.000]  And what a nice surprise. And it really is very thoughtful.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:54.000]  I really dig it. I can't believe we're recording this, I think, five days after I upgraded.
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:59.000]  Five or six days, at least as of yesterday when I was still writing my review.
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:04.000]  Just five days with the trackpad support and iPad OS. And I cannot imagine going back.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:12.000]  Cannot imagine. It was. I always write my reviews of new iPads on an iPad.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:18.000]  And it was just, you know, I know the arrow keys.
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:27.000]  I, you know, sometimes I'll use, you know, command and arrow keys to move the insertion point at the beginning or the end of the line, shift key to select words and stuff.
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:32.000]  But I use the mouse a lot, too. The mouse is great for precision text editing.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:41.000]  It's one of the things that iPad, iOS, you know, phones in general, it's a problem that I don't think Apple has licked.
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:50.000]  You and I talked about this a while back where you, when you interviewed Ken Kishenda.
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:32:02.000]  We were talking about it after, you know, the discussion after it, that one of the problems Apple just seemingly for as great as iOS has been and as revolutionary as it's been to people's daily lives.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:07.000]  One of the little things that say they never really got right is like selecting text.
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.000]  Even now, they've worked on it, they've tweaked it, you know.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:20.000]  Yeah. And even the people that worked on that whole project from the beginning, I talked to some of the people who were essentially in charge of that software.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:26.000]  And they were like, you know, none of us are ever really happy. We don't really ever think we actually nailed that.
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:35.000]  You know, that idea, that concept of insertion, text insertion and long text writing with various formatting and all of that stuff.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:44.000]  I think it's probably best in class still, but, you know, with some exceptions here and there for precise implementations of one feature or another.
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:50.000]  Which I totally agree that there's some things out there where I'm like, oh man, that's cool. I wish that was, you know, on iOS or whatever.
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:33:00.000]  But overall, best in class experience. And even then, the people that executed that are still like, yeah, you know, if I need to write a long email, I'm going to use my Mac.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:12.000]  You know what I mean? And I think that that's an interesting thing. You know, it certainly puts the idea of adding a cursor to the iPad in an interesting light.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  I mentioned a while, a few weeks ago, and a couple of people wrote to me and were like, holy crap, I had no idea that it worked like that. That there were certain decisions the original Mac team made in 1984 that maybe don't hold up so good.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  Or maybe they do. But a lot of it did. It's absolutely astounding how much of what they came up with still holds up great.
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  It's the nature of the paradigm, though, that there is a sort of select a noun and then choose an action metaphor.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  And so, like I said, the official way to open an application on the Mac is to click on it once, which selects it, and then go up to the file menu and the open command, and then that opens it.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:23.000]  Now, nobody actually does this. They double click on the thing. Double click is a shortcut for select and then use the open command, which is either command O or in the finder, you can use command down arrow to open a thing.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:31.000]  But those are just shortcuts to open the thing that is selected. And double clicking it is just a shortcut. Everybody just remembers the shortcut.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  But then people who don't really understand that that's how it works, just that short little description, most people don't know, they just know you double click and something happens.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  And then you wind up with millions of people around the world who still double click on links in web pages because they think double click is, you just have to double click everything.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  Double click means open. Yeah.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  And double clicking a link in a web browser actually does open it. You just are wasting a click that you didn't need to do.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  But there's also the circumstances where you double click on something and something unintentional happens because that second click actually does a different thing.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  Right. And it's one of the reasons people thrive, experts and non-experts alike, but especially non-experts who don't really care about how things work and just want to use it.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:39.000]  The modern touch era introduced with the original iPhone and now spread all over the world on Android and other devices where it's direct manipulation, you're not indirectly moving a pointer around and then selecting a thing or double clicking a thing to open it.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  You just see an icon for the app you want and your finger touches it once and it opens and it is, you know, you don't really have to double tap anything.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  And for stuff like just launching an app or switching an app, it's all better.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  But the original like text editing stuff with the mouse really is hard to imagine beating where if you single click, you know, number one, you drag your mouse into a text area and the mouse pointer changes to the I beam, which is nice and precise.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  And you can put it right between two letters perfectly. Click it once and the insertion point goes to where you click, click twice. It selects the word you're on.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  Click three times. And I remember when I first learned that shortcut, which was like, oh, holy crap.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  Right. Click three times and selects the whole paragraph.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  It is, you know, I think there were even apps, I don't know if there still are, but there were definitely apps at some point where like you could click like four times and like select the whole document.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  I mean, triple is about as much as I usually use, but to get the whole paragraph.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:37:02.000]  But without that, without the actual mouse pointer in there, doing some of those things is so cumbersome on iOS.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  You know, it always has been a lot of the paradigms still exist, but because you're expecting something to happen right away when you tap the screen, because you've been trained that way, it feels unnatural to be tapping.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  And remember, too, that your fingers way less precise.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  So what somebody may think is a triple click on the same target, no matter what affordances are built in to the text selection process, if you're triple tapping and your fingers at one coordinate on the first tap and then two different coordinates on the second and third tap,
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  it can only afford so much to assume that you're triple tapping on the same location rather than rapidly tapping around.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  Yeah, here's one I run into all the time because I like to I always try to give byline credit when I link to a post.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  So if Matthew Panzerino has a story at TechCrunch and I link to it, I'll write Matthew Panzerino writing at TechCrunch or reporting at TechCrunch or something like that.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  And for a lot of the times I have to get somebody's name spelled correctly, I will copy and paste it from the Web page. But if you ever try to select the author's name and a lot of Web sites, it's kind of tricky because most Web sites nowadays, if you just click the author's name, it goes to like the author bio page.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:42.000]  The name is a link to like the author's page. And that makes it hard to just I don't I don't I don't want to get the link. I don't want to go to the link. I don't want to copy the link. I just want to copy this person's surname.
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  The publication's a jerk and doesn't link the author. Right. But it's really easy with a mouse, even in a Web page. And it's really depending on and it's a weird use case. You know, it's not something it's I don't even fault the designers of Web pages and publications where it's hard to just select it with your big fat finger.
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  Yeah, but it's hard. And with the iPad, with the trackpad support now, all of a sudden it's just as easy as it is on the Mac. Boom. Just select. There it is. There's the person's last name. Copy. Right. Go back to the other thing. Paste.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  It's it's really, really good. I really enjoy it. I think it's so thoughtful and fun. I like I have everything running in the default mode. I know that you can turn off.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  There's like a little like when you move the cursor, it doesn't just stop when you lift your finger has a little bit of momentum and it keeps moving. Yeah. And I've seen a couple of people who are like, oh, thank God you can turn it off.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  I think that might be an accessibility. Some of this stuff is just in the normal trackpad preferences and some is an accessibility. I can imagine why some people would be annoyed by it.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  But if you haven't tried it yet and your first thought, I would just say give it a day or two with the default settings. I find it to be joyful.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  I think the way that it makes the mouse pointer feel alive in a way that it's never felt alive on any platform I've ever used before, period.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:24.000]  I think you said in your review that it kind of feels it feels natural in a way that like when you when you scroll on iOS and you get to the bottom, it doesn't just end like you hit a wall. It bounces.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  I think that was somebody else. I don't remember saying that, but I think it's a great observation. I don't know if that was Craig Maud's thing or. Yeah, maybe it was.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  But I agree. I think it absolutely has a feeling of like exuberance to it, which feels great. It feels fun. It also, I believe, has some affordance implications in that if somebody doesn't have fine motor skill ability or if they're not overly familiar with a mouse and cursor, which it's funny to think.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  But this adding trackpad support to the iPad may actually be many people's first experience with a trackpad. I know it seems weird because you and I and of course, many other people who are listening to this podcast are going to all have used a laptop with trackpad support or an external trackpad on a desktop.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:38.000]  But my daughter has never used a trackpad because she has a computer, which is an old iMac that I gave her. And she does her schoolwork on it. She watches She-Ra on it, does video conferences now with her teacher and all that stuff.
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  But I put a mouse on there very explicitly because I wanted her to get exposed to a mouse because guess what? She's never used a mouse either. She's seven. And sure, she's sort of like at the beginning of her computer lifespan or whatever.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  But in previous generations, the only option for a computer was to use a mouse. That was it. That was always your entry point. You used a mouse or of course, previous to that, you used a keyboard because the mouse wasn't really a thing or wasn't really required.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  But you forget that this entire generation of kids and even older kids 12 to 14 or whatever, there's a very good chance that if you lived in a household where a phone or a tablet was their first computer, they may never really have used a trackpad much.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  And it is interesting to me that this little momentum gives it the ability to move to a location and then snap to it. So it's sort of like, hey, I know where you're headed. Let's make sure that you get all the way there and grab this button or this action.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  And of course, there are all of the really cool things it does where it inhabits. I call it possession. Like it possesses an icon or a link or whatever. Sort of like the old, like a Ghostbusters type scenario.
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  The Ghostbusters cartoon when a ghost possesses somebody and they glow green or whatever. There's a ghost in there. It's like that kind of thing. It's got this little halo.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  So I thought about it through that lens, which I thought was interesting. What if that's actually really, really helpful for people that aren't used to the muscle memory of precisely going from one end of the screen to another and stopping on a dime?
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  Because they know exactly what the velocity of the cursor is going to be and how to precisely do that and what that feels like to their finger.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:47.000]  Like if I close my eyes right now, I can probably move my cursor from one end of the screen to the other end of the screen and stop pretty closely to where I want to be every time when my eyes closed.
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:44:03.000]  Simply because I've had decades of experience manipulating things with a touchpad. But I find it interesting that you could have had a lot of people where if they get an iPad and they get a keyboard with a touchpad on it, it might be their first one. It's interesting.
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:19.000]  I think one of the things people don't... The Mac interface doesn't have a lot of hover effects. One that pops to mind is that the red, yellow, green buttons have hover effects.
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:36.000]  So when you put the mouse pointer over the red, yellow, green buttons in a window, they've always lit up in some way in the Mac OS X era. They used to be more exuberant where they'd actually light up. Now you just get the little X minus and full screen things.
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  But it's just a little hint that, hey, you're on the red button. It lights up. But most things don't. And I think it would be annoying if they did. When your mouse is over the file menu in the menu bar, nothing happens to the file menu. You have to click and then it looks like it's selected and you go down.
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:08.000]  Now when you pull down on a menu, you do get a hover effect as you go over the menus to tell you which one. If you select new, then you're going to get it. So there are some, but there's not a lot.
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:28.000]  And I don't know, you have to really think of it. You have to be a little bit of a UI nerd to really think about the fact that with the arrow pointer, it's a 20 point high or 16 point high. I forget how big the standard arrow thing is. 32 pixels on a retina screen.
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:44.000]  But it's really one magic pixel at the very tip of the arrow. That one magic pixel at the top of the arrow is the magic pixel where whatever that pixel is over when you click is what gets clicked.
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:46:09.000]  The way that the iPad cursor, it's like the inverse of the Mac where most things have a hover effect and the ones that don't, I almost feel like, oh man, I hope Apple has a list of these. I've noticed that in the alerts, if you get an OK cancel alert, the buttons don't really light up. I want them to. I want those to light up too.
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:22.000]  And apps, I've noticed apps with custom UI elements, of course, they're going to have to implement it themselves. If they've used the out of the box ones that Apple provides, it gets built in. But anybody with a custom one has to design their own.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:42.000]  But you can put the arrow pointer over a button, but if it's a little bit too high and just the point of the arrow is above the button, even though the overall surface area of the mouse pointer is mostly over the button, when you click, you don't get the button. You're clicking above the button.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:47:00.000]  Whereas with the iPad, there's no ambiguity whatsoever. You can't miss it and you don't have to think about the implementation detail of, oh, it's really the point of the arrow is the only thing that really matters and the rest of it is just there so you can see it better.
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:15.000]  Whereas on the iPad implementation, you can't miss it. You don't even have to think about it. You're hovering over this button in the toolbar and you have this whole big hover effect. Boom, you know you're there and if you tap right there, you're going to get it.
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  Yeah, and there's a very straight line there to draw between that behavior and that philosophy, which I think is dead on. It's really good to observe that. And the fact that the interface has so many invisible affordances to help you actually touch the thing you think you're touching.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  Because most people don't understand, when they touch a screen, the tip of their finger, which may be on the button, is not what contacts the screen first. It's the pad. And it's basically where the whirl of your fingerprint centers.
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  And so when you're touching a screen, iOS says, oh, okay, yeah, you mean 40 pixels north of here, right? And you can test this actually. It's a fun little thing. If you've ever tried to turn your phone over and enter your passcode upside down, you understand how much of a bitch it is?
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  Because they know what orientation, you know, that that screen doesn't invert. Like on a screen that inverts, you're fine. It doesn't matter. They don't care. It's software. But if you get a screen that does not invert, that is not designed to be used in any orientation, like the passcode screen, and then you try to interact with it.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  Let's say somebody's like, oh, your phone locked. Could you unlock it for me? Like my wife does this, and she's looking through pictures, and she's like, oh, I locked the phone. And instead of doing face ID, if I'm on stand-in, let's say on the other side of a counter, and I reach over the top of the phone to try to enter my passcode, I have to explicitly move my finger further south, right?
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  Because it's moving it, or further, whatever. You know what I mean? Like towards it. Because it undershoot it. Because it's adjusting for what it knows a normal human would do, which is touching a point, and that point is too far down, you know, from where they actually want to touch.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  And there's dozens of these little affordances in the keyboard, and for icons, and for scrollable lists, and all of this stuff, right? They have a lot of experience, and frankly, it was one of the big, big secret weapons from the very beginning that made iOS feel so much easier and better to use with touch than Android or other platforms, because they may have been doing some of this, but nobody thought of it as aggressively as Apple did.
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  You know, it's like, what's the shape of a finger? How does it interact? What's the heuristics involved?
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:45.000]  They're not measuring where you're actually touching. They're measuring where you think you're touching, which is slightly different.
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:50:14.000]  You know, like, okay, I know what you're doing, but what did you actually want to do here, right? And that, I think, is embodied in the way that this cursor acts on iPad. So I think the team did a really good job of taking that same understanding that there is a general, like, nebulous nature to the way that this interface is set up, because it was built to honor a finger, you know, is built to,
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  to work on a primarily touch device. So what does a cursor look like here? How does it act here? And how should that be different than the way it acts on a Mac? And I thought, I think that this is one of those scenarios where it may not get acknowledged explicitly by a lot of people.
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  They may just think, oh, hey, cool cursor, right? Oh, that's fun. And that's interesting, which it is. It's all of those things. But it is also a decision. Like, that's a decision they had to make to break the paradigm of the way a cursor acted on a computer.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  Because the cursor on a surface, just to give an example, I don't want to be beating up on anybody, but the cursor on a surface acts exactly the same way as they did on Windows. And once again, not a bad or good thing. It's neutral, but it is a choice.
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:10.000]  Like the team decided, hey, we want to keep this universal. We want people that use Windows to feel comfortable here. So we want the cursor to look and feel and kind of act the same. Great, that's fine. That's a choice, right?
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  So this whole thing with the cursor on the iPad, it wasn't just like, oh, we think this will look cool, or be interesting. It was a decision. And then of course, hundreds and hundreds of other decisions down the road from that, we get what we got, right?
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:45.000]  So anyhow, it's a very interesting thing. And it's very rare that Apple introduces a new input mode. And though this is attached to a touchpad, I do believe it should be classified as separate from the interface that we would traditionally associate with a trackpad on, say, a Mac.
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:51.000]  You know, I do believe it's a new thing, a separate thing. It's very interesting.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:52:04.000]  Yeah, but yet some of the things still work the same. Like, it made me smile the first time I thought, well, if I hold down the Command key when I tap on a link, will it open in a new tab automatically? Yes, yes, it does.
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:28.000]  And so that's the sort of thing that when I'm on the iPad, and I've got a keyboard and a trackpad in front of it, I feel like all of a sudden, I am so much more efficient in a way that wasn't like if I go to just to name one site that I go on a daily basis talking points memo, a political site run by Josh Marshall now and a whole staff of news people, one of my favorite sites.
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  And I love their editor's blog, but their editor's blog, even though the posts are relatively short, the main listing, there's always a read more. Like, if you want to read everything, you have to read more.
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  So the way I read talking points memo is I'll load it up in a tab, and when I find one, I want to read more. I'll open in a new tab, keep scrolling. Oh, I want to open that one in a new tab, and I'll end up with like maybe three or four tabs with the full posts.
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  That's a real pain on the iPad, and it's one of those things that's kind of gotten a little worse on the phone without 3D touch because you have to kind of wait for the contextual menu.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  You click and hold, tap and hold with your finger on the link, wait for the thing to open up, open in background. It's this tap, wait, then tap the other thing, and then it goes. Whereas now with the iPad, it's exactly as efficient as the Mac where I just command tab, command click, command click, command click.
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:41.000]  Now I've got three tabs, click, click, click, read them, done. It just feels so efficient, and it's so familiar. But I agree, it definitely in other ways feels like this new thing.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:54:06.000]  Yeah, I mean, I don't think that every new thing has to be completely alien, right? I mean, being able to trace the DNA is important for consistency, is important to honor some expectations about the way things should work because, yes, while I get excited about this new computing generation and how they're interacting with machines, this is a fact of light that there's plenty of us that have used a computer before, and we're going to be using this, right?
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  So you have to honor that, as I said, that muscle memory, that intellectual memory about the way things are supposed to work enough so that it doesn't feel completely alien. It feels fresh and new and exciting, but not frustrating.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:44.000]  And maybe in terms of not feeling alien and frustrating, a good comparison is Apple TV with tvOS, which is the first iOS variant to ship with trackpad support, right? Because the magic remote, what do they call the Apple TV remote? There's a name for it.
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  Crap? I don't know.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  Sorry, Apple TV remote team.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  It has, you know, a trackpad at the top. I don't know, you know, whatever you want to call it. It's a trackpad that you slide your finger over. But on the tvOS, there is no cursor at all.
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  You're just moving the selection around, and it pops off the screen. And I can't help but suspect, and I kind of actually maybe secretly know that the cursor idea that we now see in the iPad was originally one of the concepts for Apple TV, that there'd be something similar.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  As you move your thumb around on the remote, you'd see a cursor that when it was over, an icon would make it pop. Very much like the home screen now.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  And that, you know, somehow the actual let's show the cursor when it's in the dead zone between tappable items, you know, lost the argument for tvOS, but it obviously came back for iPad OS. And boy, I think that would really improve tvOS.
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  Again, five days into it, I'm convinced that Apple TV would be better if the, even if you use the same crappy remote, it would be better if there was a cursor just like the one on iPad OS that would move around.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  Right. The one on Apple TV, not to go into a rabbit hole, but the one on Apple TV reminds me of when your computer enters a fail state and your cursor disappears, and you can still move it around, you know?
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  And you can say, oh, that's where it is right now. It's hovering over that folder. You know, okay, if I move south of there three inches and then over two inches, double click, I got it, I got it, right? And it's like open settings and, you know, turn off a mouse, turn it back on or something, whatever.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:58.000]  You know, whatever you're trying to do, just restart your computer. Like, oh, is it in the corner? You know? And I think that that's the way it's always felt to me. It feels unpredictable because you can't track it, right? It's like, where is it?
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:12.000]  You know, who knows? It's anybody's guess. And I think that that's obviously, you know, it's sort of solved by the fact that, yes, it's going to become contextually aware. One thing I really like about the cursor on the iPad is when you do touch an icon, of course, it snaps to that icon.
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:29.000]  So you can move it around a little bit. And because the icon shifts, you know, sort of does that isometric shifting or parallax shifting, isometric. Because it does that, it has a little sheen to it, right? It's got that little shine.
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:41.000]  And it's almost like your cursor is rattling around inside there, like moving inside that box of that icon. And it knows that you probably want to stay in there unless you really move out, right? And then, of course, exits that icon and moves on.
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:56.000]  But it's the same thing from the Apple TV. You know, people drew parallels pretty quickly because obviously you could see it, right? Because that Apple TV thing does the same. If you move your thumb around a little bit, it does that shift, which is cool. I like that aspect of it. I think that's really neat.
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:10.000]  But being able to see that that is inhabited, and then when it exits there, losing the context of it right away is not a great experience. Whereas on the iPad, you keep the context, okay, where am I headed now?
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:34.000]  Yeah, and it would make it so much easier. And Apple's own apps are structured in a way that's a more rectilinear grid that I think is meant for the remote. Whereas third-party apps, including Netflix, you know, Netflix's app is supposed to look like Netflix and even HBO Go and Hulu in particular is sort of weird.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:48.000]  Where you don't know what's going to happen if you just go up, right? Because you're not really going up to a thing that is directly above the currently selected thing. You're kind of like, it's like up and over. And you're like, I think if I just go up, it'll change to that.
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:59:09.000]  Whereas if you had a little cursor on screen like the iPad, there'd be no ambiguity about it at all. You know? I don't know. This is such a nicer solution. And maybe, you know, tvOS, maybe it's good that it went too far without having a pointer at all and only a selected state that you moved around.
[01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:23.000]  But I feel like, boy, this feels just right. This is the middle bowl and the Goldilocks, you know, bowls of porridge. Man, this one is just right. And I would really like to see that get to tvOS.
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:49.000]  I don't have a lot to say about the actual iPad Pro hardware. I honestly even less than the MacBook Air. It really is. I almost wish I'd used this in my review. And again, this is not a complaint because I like the idea that they would do a mid-cycle update like this, a spec bump in between major updates rather than let it go two and a half or three years or something between updates at all.
[01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:59.000]  So I'm glad they did it, but it's not a major new update. It's sort of like a Rev B of the 2018 iPad Pros.
[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:25.000]  Yeah, I think that's a fair way to position it. Yeah, you know, it's hardly faster, no faster at all CPU wise. The graphics card, you and I were talking about this while we were writing our reviews where they're like, it's 80 percent faster than the A10 powered iPad Pro from, you know, a couple of years ago. And then it just says it's also faster than the 2018 iPad Pros. They don't tell you how much. It's just faster.
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:42.000]  Yeah, exactly. You know, it's faster for sure, for sure. Trust us. I mean, you know, it obviously is. We ran the benchmarks in the comparative benchmarks show us that it has made forward progress, but certainly you understand why they didn't crow about it or make a big deal because it's just a little bit faster.
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:01:04.000]  Yeah, right. But you also understand why they shipped it without going to the A13 or waiting for the A14 because it didn't need to be faster. The 2018 iPad Pros were almost ridiculously fast, like hard to believe how fast they were. And they're still plenty fast enough. And so really all this has better camera system. I'm going to write about it.
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:33.760]  It does remind me. It does remind me of, you know, when they introduce a new like Bugatti, right? They're like, Oh, hey, the Veyron, right? Fastest production car in the universe. And you're like, Oh, okay, cool. That's awesome. Oh, yeah, it gets like 220 mile an hour top speed. You know, that's really cool. A, I'm never gonna buy one anyway, but that's really awesome and whatever. And then they introduced the next like the Chiron, the fastest, most powerful, you know, zero to 60 in six point or 3.2 seconds, which is
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:02:03.520]  point one seconds faster than the Bugatti Veyron. You're like, Okay, sure. You know, it already will peel like you could burn a pair of tires out in in one run up to 200 miles an hour. Like you have to replace your tires after that run. But now it's slightly faster. You're like, Well, okay, I was already replacing tires every time I took off, right? And I think that that's kind of what the iPad Pro is already. I've never once gone, man, I wish this was more powerful. And so
[02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:30.880]  at this point, it doesn't really need to be until they do something first party where they're like, Hey, we need the horsepower, which apparently does not exist yet. So the the LiDAR sensor is obviously new is the first device Apple has made with a LiDAR sensor. It is a huge difference for AR. Really, your your review captures it perfectly. You know more about AR than anybody I know. But it really that that whole startup and wave your device around while the device sort of
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:03:00.800]  figures out what shape room or where what the heck is going on around you, all gone. You just start the AR experience, the LiDAR sensor kicks in. And it's like, Okay, there's a table in front of me. You know, really, really, really great. But how much are we using AR right now? It just all still feels like prep for a future when when they're yeah, when AR is it's like future proofing these these devices, as opposed to AR.
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:30.000]  Really changing your day to day life. And I don't mean to put that down. I think AR kit is amazing. I think that it is fascinating to watch. It's one of those things that is improving at a very noticeable clip year after year, right? Like, you know, what one WWDC after another AR kit is like, Whoa, that is that's a big difference from the year before that it's a big team with
[02:03:30.880 --> 02:04:00.800]  good leadership with Mike Mike Rockwell. And they're doing really interesting stuff. But you cannot help but feel that really, really, really just feel in your gut that this isn't really about doing AR on these devices. This is about laying the groundwork. So that when an AR first device ships some kind of goggles or Pfizer or something, there's this huge grounds, you know, just huge existing developer base of Oh, I know how to do that. I've been using
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:30.280]  AR kit. I've been using these API's for years. You kind of can't help but feel that. Right, the actual cameras are better. I can't believe I didn't think to do this for my review. But the great, great third party camera app halide has a feature where they give you a technical camera readout. And I didn't think to do it till after I wrote my review. But looking at the specs, you can think Oh, maybe this is exactly like the iPhone 11.
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:59.920]  Non pro camera system because it has two cameras, a wide and an ultra wide. But if you look at the actual technical readout, it they're completely different paths. They this is completely different camera hardware. Even the focal lengths are slightly different. You know, the on the iPhone 11, the regular lens is 26 millimeters on the iPhone or the iPad Pro, it's 28 millimeters, which is very slight, but it is different. Different maximum ISOs, etc, etc.
[02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:21.920]  So it's not identical camera. And I think that kind that's one of the factors that plays into why it doesn't do portrait mode. Because it wasn't just copy and paste the code from the iPhone 11 and did, you know, put it in the iPad Pro. And now it has the same rear facing portrait mode because it's different camera lenses. And because instead of the A 13, it's got the A 12 z.
[02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:51.900]  I, I think you and I both know that it was simply they just ran out of time to get it done for 13.4. It may or may not, maybe an iOS or iPad OS 14. Maybe these actual iPads shipping right now will gain portrait mode, maybe they never will get it. But it was just, you know, it in theory, they could have it, but they don't. And I kind of see why it's different.
[02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:55.820]  I mean, I don't know why priority wise, that that wasn't the top priority for getting it out right now.
[02:05:55.820 --> 02:06:25.700]  Yeah, I mean, the iPhone's always gonna be a top priority. So if they didn't ship it, it is most likely because they're working on the next iPhone or they, you know, working on the last iPhone and this, this shipping sort of mid cycle was not a top priority to get portrait mode working with a new completely new sensor. You know, if the iPhone 12 knee, whatever, you know, has a LIDAR sensor in it, you can bet your bones that they will be the portrait mode will still ship on that, you know,
[02:06:26.300 --> 02:06:30.980]  but they're, they're not, I don't believe that it was top priority to get it on this iPad for this release.
[02:06:30.980 --> 02:06:58.180]  So basically, when we got to review these iPad pros, and the thing that we really wanted to review, we don't get to review, which is the Magic Keyboard. And I'm not surprised that we didn't get it. And, you know, you never know with Apple, and like I wrote my review, there is one notable exception I can think of, which was the original AirPods, which didn't ship, you know, they announced them in September when they did the iPhones. And they didn't ship until December.
[02:06:58.180 --> 02:07:23.180]  And if you remember those original AirPods, it was like really dicey to get them for Christmas, even if you were like constantly reloading to be like one of the first order it was that it was really down to the wire. They gave us reviewers, we reviewers, quote unquote, prototype AirPods to review in in late September, and we, you know, keep them until December when the other one shipped.
[02:07:23.180 --> 02:07:52.180]  And in my personal experience, they were physically and in actual use, identical to the ones that actually shipped, but they were deemed prototypes. And they, they really wanted them back the very day that the non prototype one shipped. And I duly sent them back. Other than AirPods, I can't remember Apple supplying me as a reviewer with anything more than about 10 days in advance of it shipping and usually about a week, you know, like,
[02:07:52.180 --> 02:08:13.180]  you know, our reviews for the new iPad Pro dropped yesterday. People started getting their their iPad Pros that they pre ordered right away yesterday. You know, that's, that's typically how it works. So I would not expect I have no idea. I did ask I was like, Am I going to get that we're going to get the magic keyboard? And they were like, No, not yet.
[02:08:13.180 --> 02:08:37.180]  I didn't even bother asking when, but I would expect that, you know, whenever they do decide, okay, we can ship this starting on we can start taking pre orders on May 21. And we'll ship it on May 28, or something like that, that those who get review units will get them like, you know, May 21, the day they start taking orders or something like that, maybe a week before it actually ships.
[02:08:37.180 --> 02:08:44.180]  I think that's safe. I can't wait for that thing. I, I just want to play with the hinge so bad.
[02:08:44.180 --> 02:09:07.180]  I am intrigued. I am definitely intrigued by just every dimension of that, like, you know, hinge tension, stability, you know, adjustment options. There is the the feel of the keyboard itself. Yeah, all of it.
[02:09:07.180 --> 02:09:23.180]  There and their video, their videos make it seem like you can disconnect it from the magnets with one hand, you know that you don't need to hold it down. Now, maybe that I don't know, you know, that'll be interesting to see. And if it does take two hands on, you know, that's not a deal breaker.
[02:09:23.180 --> 02:09:36.180]  I can't wait for I don't have anything to say, though, because I haven't used it. And so anybody listening to this knows every every bit as much about the magic keyboard as I do, and you do, there's there's not much else there.
[02:09:36.180 --> 02:10:00.180]  So what it what would be an interesting thing because obviously people are getting these new iPads now if they order one, you know, there seem to be shipping. They haven't sold out as far as I've seen. I am interested to see a teardown, as normally happens somebody like iFixit or another person out there will do a teardown of these iPads or new new hardware all the time.
[02:10:00.180 --> 02:10:10.180]  And if iFixit does a teardown, I'm interested to see if the magnet placement has changed between the iPad, the 2018 iPad and the 2020 iPad Pros.
[02:10:10.180 --> 02:10:34.180]  You know, that obviously they introduced the new kind of magnet array in the back, these antipodal magnets that you kind of apply oppositional force to keep things to align and keep things attached to the iPad, including the pencil, which has an interesting kind of set of dipole magnets in it to make sure it snaps exactly to perfect alignment so that it can charge when you throw it to the top of the iPad.
[02:10:34.180 --> 02:10:40.180]  And then, of course, the magic keyboard, the current one that we're using, the smart keyboard, I think they call it.
[02:10:41.180 --> 02:10:44.180]  And I call it the dumb keyboard.
[02:10:45.180 --> 02:11:00.180]  Right. The dumb keyboard. Although, you know, I don't know, I have I actually have a it's certainly not my favorite type of experience of all time, but I've gained a fondness for its durability and reliability over the past couple of years because I've spilled all kinds of crap on it.
[02:11:00.180 --> 02:11:18.180]  Like, you know, planes and cocktails and whatever else. And it's held up pretty well. But that said, like that back alignment happens automatically because of those magnets that are buried behind the back plane of that of the iPad in it. And it holds very nicely. Like I've never had a disconnect when I don't want it to.
[02:11:18.180 --> 02:11:31.180]  And there are actually magnets in the in the keyboard itself to help keep it into the grooves. You know, when you put it at the different angles, there's all kinds of magnets all over and keep it close.
[02:11:32.180 --> 02:11:44.180]  Yeah, exactly. And I think it would be really interesting to see what would happen or what will happen or if anything with the placement of magnets to support the magic keyboard.
[02:11:44.180 --> 02:12:02.180]  I'm curious if they had to swizzle them where they still work with the existing smart keyboard, but the magic keyboard requires additional magnets, say on the right side of a vertical or top half of a horizontal iPad in order to support it better.
[02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:14.180]  I don't know. It's curious. You know, it'd be interesting one or whether they basically said, hey, this is the array of magnets we have to use rather than change those. Let's make sure the magic keyboard can accomplish what it needs to accomplish utilizing those existing magnets.
[02:12:14.180 --> 02:12:33.180]  I enjoyed your review tremendously. I'll link to it, I promise, in the show notes. But one of the things you mentioned is that since November 2018, you've, for traveling, and you've traveled a lot in the last year and a half, your iPad is your portable computer.
[02:12:33.180 --> 02:12:48.180]  And I think it's a great story. I don't want to rehash it here. But there's the thing you mentioned is you can just take it out. It's on. You don't have to wait for all sorts of like alerts and messages and stuff to catch up.
[02:12:48.180 --> 02:13:02.180]  You just take it out, turn it on. You're on the Internet. You can do a thing, close it back up, put it away. My example, I mentioned this to you. I love having an iPad for like when you board an airplane and you're in your seat and I'm usually on my phone.
[02:13:02.180 --> 02:13:13.180]  And I'll notice something like my example was like somebody, you know, maybe I'll have posted something just before I boarded to Daring Fireball. And I get on my plane and somebody tweets me that I have a mistake or a typo.
[02:13:13.180 --> 02:13:26.180]  I can quick take out an iPad, get on cellular networking, fix the typo, close it, all in the time that it would have taken to get a Mac out and get it tethered to the phone.
[02:13:26.180 --> 02:13:33.180]  And by the time I would have even had a network connection, my iPad's already back in my backpack underneath the seat in front of me.
[02:13:33.180 --> 02:13:46.180]  And for travel, like part of traveling with a portable computer is like that sort of not a sustained work session, but the sort of dipping in and out. And man, that burst of activity.
[02:13:46.180 --> 02:13:52.180]  Yeah, here's my question for you. Maybe you answered it and I missed it. I forgot it. But what size iPad are you traveling with?
[02:13:52.180 --> 02:14:01.180]  So I'm traveling with the 12.9 and I have actually never even used the 11. So I've never even touched one.
[02:14:01.180 --> 02:14:13.180]  It is something I want to rectify. I actually want to buy one or borrow one to play with in the new year because I do feel that I need to understand whether or not that works for me and why it does or why it doesn't.
[02:14:13.180 --> 02:14:25.180]  The 12.9 I've had a wonderful experience with because I can essentially have two, I don't know what you'd call it, like they're not full size pages, but they feel full size pages side by side.
[02:14:25.180 --> 02:14:34.180]  And that view of let's say my two different back channels, like we have two different back channel communication tools.
[02:14:34.180 --> 02:14:44.180]  And so those two, I basically the way I arrange my spaces on my iPad, which I should probably write up some stuff on this, I got a few requests, like how do you work on the iPad? Like what is your process?
[02:14:44.180 --> 02:14:50.180]  And one of the ways that I arrange my spaces, my workspaces is that I put public and private spaces separately.
[02:14:50.180 --> 02:15:07.180]  So for instance, our iMessage and Slack or combo and Slack or our back channel tools, those will be paired together. And then public spaces, like let's say Twitter and email, you know, email is not quite public, but it straddles the line, right?
[02:15:07.180 --> 02:15:14.180]  Those will be separate. So it's like, hey, if you're in this space, the things that you're saying are private, ostensibly.
[02:15:14.180 --> 02:15:26.180]  And in this space, the things that you're saying are public. And for me, that helps me to divide my work life out, you know, as I'm flowing so that I know, hey, if I'm saying things here, they're being broadcast.
[02:15:26.180 --> 02:15:36.180]  And if I'm saying things here, they're being narrowcast. And if I'm saying things here, they're being said only to me, like a notepad and a word processor, for instance, right?
[02:15:36.180 --> 02:15:46.180]  And that's the way I kind of flow through those things. So my question really is for myself, do those same workspaces work on an 11?
[02:15:46.180 --> 02:15:55.180]  Are they viable? Or is it more of a slide over situation where I need one workspace up and the other workspace over the edge, you know, that kind of thing.
[02:15:55.180 --> 02:15:59.180]  So that's what I need to kind of suss out, whether the 11 works for that or not.
[02:15:59.180 --> 02:16:14.180]  Yeah, and it's a choice we don't really have on the Mac side of things, especially, you know, the closest we had was the, and I've gotten a bunch of emails from people who, like me, were fans of the old 11 inch MacBook Air back in the day.
[02:16:14.180 --> 02:16:22.180]  Now that the 12 inch just plain no adjective MacBook is gone, the 13 inch MacBook Air is the smallest MacBook Apple makes right now.
[02:16:22.180 --> 02:16:31.180]  And seemingly for the, you know, near term future. I'm never going to say never. You never want to bet against Apple making things smaller and lighter.
[02:16:31.180 --> 02:16:42.180]  But with, you know, the 12.9 inch, I mean, look, it's 12.9. I mean, they could call it 13. It's actually closer to 13 inches than the MacBook Air, which is 13.3, right?
[02:16:42.180 --> 02:16:52.180]  The MacBook Air is three tenths of an inch bigger than 13. The iPad is one tenth of an inch away from being 13.
[02:16:52.180 --> 02:17:10.180]  You know, it's marketing that they're calling it 12.9 instead of 13. But, you know, pound for pound, size for size, the 12.9 inch iPad Pro with a portable keyboard of some sort is very, very, very physically comparable to a MacBook Air.
[02:17:10.180 --> 02:17:31.180]  You know, roughly the same weight, roughly the same size. The 11 inch iPad Pro, or if you just want to carry around, you know, the iPad Air or the regular iPad, you know, which has a new interesting new keyboard from Logitech with a trackpad, you know, underneath that Apple worked with them in conjunction with.
[02:17:31.180 --> 02:17:41.180]  Those devices give you a portable option for a laptop ish thing that is way lighter and smaller than anything else.
[02:17:41.180 --> 02:17:50.180]  You know, and again, you know, like you delineated very well, there's certainly downsides to having the smaller screen in terms of what you can show side by side and stuff like that.
[02:17:50.180 --> 02:18:06.180]  But it's all other aspects of Mac versus iPad OS software wise with the apps and the interface and stuff like that, just in terms of the thing you carry around, it is an option that you just don't get on the Mac side of things.
[02:18:06.180 --> 02:18:20.180]  Yes, correct. Yeah. And I mean, it makes me miss the Mac, the 12 inch MacBook. But, you know, I do, which was one of my favorite computers ever. You know, I just I love that thing, despite the keyboard.
[02:18:20.180 --> 02:18:25.180]  But it's a shame. It's a shame it didn't live long enough to get the scissors, the scissor key.
[02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:37.180]  Yeah, and I think you and I were in this have got the same information from the same people. But the gist behind that Macbook existing was like, I don't know, we just wanted to try it.
[02:18:37.180 --> 02:18:45.180]  Yeah, like we just we just wanted to see if it would work. And it did. And that was cool. But it wasn't really one we felt like we needed to keep doing in perpetuity.
[02:18:45.180 --> 02:18:57.180]  And that in the future, they may make similar gambles with the Mac. I think the near term future of the Mac is pretty sketched out. You know, we're going to get a replacement for the 13 inch with the new keyboard. We know that's coming.
[02:18:57.180 --> 02:19:07.180]  Obviously, the 16 was just introduced, the air has been refreshed. We know what the near term future of the Mac lineup looks like. But I do hope that they continue to experiment.
[02:19:07.180 --> 02:19:23.180]  You know that they do continue to do things like, hey, let's do a 12 inch MacBook with, you know, specs that are good enough, but that it's super light for those people that want that. And you know that there are obviously historical lines to draw between that and other 12 inch, you know, models that they released in the past.
[02:19:23.180 --> 02:19:45.180]  But that was back when screens only only came into. So, you know, I think there's there's room for experimentation there. But the 11 inch to me, the 11 inch iPad Pro, I've been so impressed with the 12.9 that it's incredibly intriguing to me if my workflows are if I'm able to pull off my workflows on that.
[02:19:45.180 --> 02:20:05.180]  That is a massive change in how you travel with an iPad, or how you travel with a portable computer, just like the amount of weight. Because remember, it's it's a cascading effect. So like, let's say you're the 12.9. Essentially, you have to get a bag made for a 13 inch MacBook, right, or 13 inch laptop.
[02:20:05.180 --> 02:20:20.180]  That bag, generally speaking, will come with, you know, room to fit accessories that would you normally fit with that, including a 13 inch laptop charger, which, you know, even the apples are still quite large in the grand scheme of things.
[02:20:20.180 --> 02:20:36.180]  And the, you know, cables and whatever else you might need to attach to that or whatever you don't need. Oh, shut up. It's my Apple Watch. I need to start wearing it backwards like like Greg.
[02:20:36.180 --> 02:20:53.180]  But we're trying to thought Oh, yeah, but with if you move to a 11 inch iPad, you can go down to a bag that's minuscule, right? Overall, it's like tiny, it feels like a like a side bag that you carry, you know, just accessories in or, you know, a day bag or something.
[02:20:53.180 --> 02:21:09.180]  You can go down to that you can ditch or obviously will fit in a purse if you if you just want a solo bag in your in your woman, it'll fit right in your purse. Without a lot of extraneous accessories. You don't really need any massive power adapters, the power adapter for the iPad is tiny.
[02:21:09.180 --> 02:21:16.180]  You know, even the beefier USB C one is very easy to fit in any almost any bag.
[02:21:16.180 --> 02:21:30.180]  It just everything scales down because then you start to rethink everything that you carry with you and you start to question all of it, right? And you go Do I need this? Do I need that? Like I don't really need these USB C cables. I don't need these extension dongles. I don't really need all of this other stuff.
[02:21:30.180 --> 02:21:52.180]  And all of a sudden you're carrying a pair of out of AirPods, a pencil if you want it, the iPad and an adapter the size that's like two inches square and a cable and that's it. Like if you really want to be clever, you don't even have to carry you carry one USB C to lightning cable with you.
[02:21:52.180 --> 02:22:04.180]  And you could charge your phone off of your iPad or off of the iPads charger as well. Because the iPads battery lasts so long that you're almost never in sync of having to charge both of them at the same time.
[02:22:04.180 --> 02:22:15.180]  So for short trips or for quick, you know, lightweight trips or time away from the office or whatever, you could get away with just those four things and be done.
[02:22:15.180 --> 02:22:34.180]  And that is a massive change in lifestyle, you know, in travel lifestyle. And sure, accuse me of getting old and being less desirous of carrying massive amounts of equipment with me, but I feel a hell of a lot better when I'm breezing through an airport with a tiny bag and just an iPad in it.
[02:22:34.180 --> 02:22:47.180]  Not much going on, then, you know, hauling around my entire, you know, supply of cables and adapters and accessories. And it's been a good it's been a great lifestyle to work with portably.
[02:22:47.180 --> 02:23:05.180]  Yeah, and I I'm an 11 inch person. And primarily because I don't use I never really travel extensively with only an iPad. And so I'm the gratuitous jerk who travels with both a MacBook and an iPad.
[02:23:05.180 --> 02:23:17.180]  I wouldn't do that if it was if my only option for an iPad was 12.9 it would be too that's too much. Whereas the 11 feels like I could carry this to and use it for all the dipping in and dipping out type things I said.
[02:23:17.180 --> 02:23:28.180]  But like the other type of travel, which isn't like going away for an extended period of time, but like, back in the old days when Apple would have in person media briefings.
[02:23:28.180 --> 02:23:46.180]  And hopefully the good times when that will come back but like a day trip to New York, right? Like hop on the train here in Philly, go to New York, have a couple meetings, maybe do some work before I leave New York, and then hop back on the train and come back to Philly.
[02:23:46.180 --> 02:24:03.180]  Just taking an iPad for that in a bag. And I have like a shoulder bag that's just the perfect size for like an 11 inch. It's glorious because, you know, there's a lot of walking even more than like in an airport like going to a meeting in New York is a lot more walking
[02:24:03.180 --> 02:24:17.180]  and it just feels it feels like I'm carrying nothing. Not that, you know, a 13 inch MacBook Pro or even a 16 inch MacBook Pro is that much weight. But boy, it feels like you're carrying nothing when you're just carrying around an iPad.
[02:24:17.180 --> 02:24:33.180]  Yeah, well, like the dimensional size, you got to add two to three inches on all sides of it for the bag, you know, and it becomes cumbersome and then by human nature is to fill it with stuff, you know? It cascades, you know?
[02:24:33.180 --> 02:24:38.180]  Right, exactly. I guess I'll just bring this kombucha.
[02:24:38.180 --> 02:24:51.180]  All right, that's good. I will thank you for your time, Matthew. It's always been a pleasure. I wish you and your family the best. Good luck getting out of this thing. Thanks for the good work on your iPad review.
[02:24:51.180 --> 02:24:53.180]  Yeah, thanks. I enjoyed yours as well.
[02:24:53.180 --> 02:25:09.180]  Yeah, thank you. Anyway, people can follow you on Twitter at Panzer, P-A-N-Z-E-R. And of course, you and your team's excellent continuing work at TechCrunch. Anything else you want to promote or did I cover all the bases?
[02:25:09.180 --> 02:25:13.180]  No, not really. Go play Half-Life Alyx if you have VR. It's awesome.
[02:25:13.180 --> 02:25:21.180]  Oh, my son was just telling me about that. My son was just telling me that it's the first like AAA game that's VR first or VR only.
[02:25:21.180 --> 02:25:29.180]  Right. Yeah, it's killer. It's really good. They did a great job. I wrote a review. If anybody wants to check it out, that's about all I got.
[02:25:29.180 --> 02:25:32.180]  Oh, that's the thing you were telling me about that you had to work on.
[02:25:32.180 --> 02:25:52.180]  Yeah, I had to do the iPad review and the Alyx review at the same time. I was playing basically VR every night for three hours trying to finish the game. Everybody's on lockdown right now, so we're all talking in our group chats. I said, I got to do X and Y.
[02:25:52.180 --> 02:26:08.180]  And one of my friends was like, shut the hell up. I don't want to hear you complaining about anything. I'm like, look, this is the career I chose. It's not my fault that I have to play hotly anticipated VR games and test new hardware.
[02:26:08.180 --> 02:26:12.180]  Whereas other people are learning how to cook beans.
[02:26:12.180 --> 02:26:28.180]  Correct. Other people are learning how to cook red beans.
