[00:00.000 --> 00:02.320]  How's your week? Oh my god
[00:07.200 --> 00:09.800]  Geez what did I why did I launch an app I?
[00:10.960 --> 00:16.000]  Forgot how much work this is it's been a while since I've had an app in the store and the last app that was in the store was the magazine
[00:16.080 --> 00:18.320]  Because I'm very popular and didn't require tech support
[00:19.840 --> 00:22.000]  Man what was I thinking?
[00:23.320 --> 00:25.320]  What what's gone wrong?
[00:25.320 --> 00:32.720]  Um, it's it's mostly the funny thing is it's been a very successful launch overall like there have been very few
[00:34.760 --> 00:38.520]  Real major problems. There have been a few minor bugs
[00:39.560 --> 00:45.600]  Many of which I would have been able to fix server side just like you know some certain podcast fees weren't being crawled right or something but
[00:47.560 --> 00:53.480]  Overall the launch had been really good the problem is I've gotten nothing done since yesterday when I launched it
[00:53.480 --> 01:00.520]  Because I've been trying to keep up with all the tweet responses trying to read all the reviews trying to and it's your recently
[01:00.520 --> 01:02.520]  Tires to try to answer all these emails
[01:02.840 --> 01:04.840]  Yeah, I currently have
[01:05.480 --> 01:07.480]  1,099 unready emails on my inbox
[01:08.200 --> 01:12.960]  I've just finally started tackling them tonight after making a bunch of tech tech spender snippets
[01:12.960 --> 01:19.360]  They look all the common responses the worst part is the worst part is that that's over a hundred higher than number you quoted me about
[01:19.360 --> 01:26.600]  Six or seven hours ago when I checked to see if you wanted to be on this show. Yeah, and I just bought it to like 150 of them
[01:27.880 --> 01:33.680]  But they're coming in faster like a response. You're at like 900 around noon or so
[01:34.040 --> 01:38.680]  Yeah, I mean so I guess I was nine hours ago. So that's to give you some idea like the
[01:38.680 --> 01:44.920]  The total downloads of the entire app like the number of people who have even downloaded it not even the people who've made an account
[01:44.920 --> 01:50.520]  Just the people who've downloaded the app at all is roughly 35 to 40,000. I don't know. I haven't gotten today's stats yet
[01:50.520 --> 01:54.920]  But so I'm estimating a little bit, but roughly 35 or 40,000. Wow, and I've gotten
[01:55.880 --> 01:58.680]  I mean, that's a fantastic launch. I'm very happy with that, but
[01:59.560 --> 02:01.560]  Out of those at least
[02:01.560 --> 02:03.560]  1500 of them have emailed me
[02:03.560 --> 02:09.080]  Oh my god. That seems like a kind of high ratio to me. I don't know that that kind of seems too high
[02:09.080 --> 02:13.480]  Yeah, that does seem high, but it's I think it's also the nature though
[02:13.480 --> 02:15.480]  You're the weird dual nature and you know
[02:16.360 --> 02:18.720]  I'm in the same boat, but but where we're
[02:19.320 --> 02:26.200]  Media personalities, you know people read our sites. We're sort of have a columnist style and we do podcasts of course
[02:26.840 --> 02:28.360]  obviously I
[02:28.360 --> 02:30.360]  think we do I
[02:30.680 --> 02:32.680]  Think that encourages a sort of
[02:34.280 --> 02:39.640]  The wanting to give feedback, you know what I mean like yeah, and I don't think and again
[02:39.640 --> 02:44.840]  I bet you'll agree with me. I will bet you will agree with me with this that even though you're complaining about being swamped
[02:44.840 --> 02:51.400]  But you're it's a privilege and a thrill that people want to do that and say nice things about your app or ask questions and stuff
[02:51.400 --> 02:59.280]  I don't pre-grudge it. Oh, definitely. I mean, I I really want to do as much of the support of this myself
[03:00.120 --> 03:06.840]  And and I probably forget saying that. Oh god bless you. Well, but what I've done instead is I've tried to
[03:06.840 --> 03:13.960]  Ridiculously minimize the number of supporting me as I actually get so I can actually treat them like like a human being or at
[03:13.960 --> 03:16.760]  least hire somebody to do it and and keep an eye on it very closely
[03:17.080 --> 03:21.480]  Whereas with with insta paper. I was never able to do that. There was too much support and that's sort of a a
[03:22.040 --> 03:25.960]  virtuous circle where you being motivated
[03:26.840 --> 03:28.840]  to minimize support issues
[03:29.080 --> 03:32.360]  Design and development wise because you know you're gonna have to deal with them yourself
[03:32.360 --> 03:37.480]  Means that if you're succeed it works and you have less time doing support and vice versa
[03:37.480 --> 03:43.280]  You know, whereas if you had somebody doing support you may not maybe you wouldn't be as you wouldn't care quite as much
[03:43.520 --> 03:46.840]  Right, this is something that you know friend of the universe Daniel Jalka has always said
[03:47.360 --> 03:51.760]  That he I believe this is still the case that he always answers all of his own support email
[03:52.280 --> 04:00.160]  So that he is both you know on top of issues as they arise and aware of what people are asking for and so that he is motivated to
[04:00.160 --> 04:05.840]  You know, fix problems in the app that cause a lot of support issues so that people don't even have to email it
[04:06.160 --> 04:09.920]  So you know everyone wins there. So I'm trying it out. I'll see. I mean
[04:11.360 --> 04:14.640]  I don't have any idea what the like stable
[04:15.920 --> 04:17.920]  Email rate will be you know, I
[04:18.560 --> 04:23.280]  Five weeks from now on a Tuesday, you know, what's what's gonna be the email rate that day? I don't know
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.960]  So I'll see if I can still handle it myself
[04:26.960 --> 04:31.360]  I would like to do as much about myself in the early days as possible like this this initial batch of
[04:32.000 --> 04:37.280]  Out now it's 1100 got one more this initial batch of 1100 plus emails
[04:37.920 --> 04:43.120]  I would like to go through myself just so I have some idea like what are people asking for what you know
[04:43.120 --> 04:49.120]  What what should I be doing differently? What is confusing people about the app that I should I should you know
[04:49.120 --> 04:51.760]  Think about rearranging or relabeling or rethinking
[04:51.760 --> 04:56.080]  I know I know cable sassar does the same thing with major releases
[04:57.360 --> 05:02.560]  I don't know if he does it with every major release, but I know that he's done that like and I don't think he has
[05:02.560 --> 05:06.960]  Itates to dive into the support on a regular basis, but like when they launch like coda, you know
[05:06.960 --> 05:13.680]  I don't know 4.0 whatever the next version is he'll spend like that that like 36 hour manic period of okay
[05:13.680 --> 05:15.680]  It is out
[05:16.320 --> 05:19.200]  On the front lines of the support queue, you know
[05:19.200 --> 05:23.360]  Working through it because he wants that experience. He wants to see that, you know
[05:24.080 --> 05:26.800]  Initial feedback and it's true. It's valuable
[05:26.960 --> 05:32.880]  There's like an endorphin high of of a big release like this that and it to me it
[05:32.960 --> 05:36.480]  It's you know in hindsight you're gonna look back and say this was a great week
[05:37.040 --> 05:44.320]  Um if it's you know as long as the launch is successful and it's not something like holy crap the you know the server actually can't
[05:44.640 --> 05:46.640]  You know take more than 100 years
[05:46.640 --> 05:50.640]  And that I looked at a big time with that because I was that's what I was most worried about
[05:50.640 --> 05:53.440]  Oh, I had forgotten about the the concept of support email
[05:53.440 --> 05:59.440]  I was much more worried about the server's holding up and because I didn't really I couldn't really predict
[06:00.080 --> 06:02.120]  How heavy the load would be on the server?
[06:02.120 --> 06:05.920]  So I went to line out where all my stuff is a couple days ago
[06:05.920 --> 06:11.760]  And I just added like eight new servers just because you can add or destroy them whenever you want their build hourly
[06:11.840 --> 06:15.840]  So I was like, you know, let me just add way more capacity than I think I will need
[06:15.840 --> 06:20.000]  And and make a way that I can easily clone them if I need even more than that and
[06:20.560 --> 06:26.240]  And then you know, I can always take them all down next week. Yeah, and and you have the advantage where you've done
[06:26.640 --> 06:31.280]  large-scale things before insta paper had a ton of users and you know
[06:31.840 --> 06:33.840]  You know a lot like
[06:34.240 --> 06:39.520]  Overcast is largely, you know, it's the whole thing is the whole premise is built on this the server
[06:40.480 --> 06:43.600]  Tumbler obviously I think has a fair number of users
[06:43.600 --> 06:45.600]  a
[06:45.600 --> 06:46.800]  little bit yeah
[06:46.800 --> 06:53.200]  And even you know, however much smaller they were when you left tumbler the tumbler was a big ass website when you left
[06:53.400 --> 06:59.600]  Yeah, I mean when I left if I screwed up I would serve about 1200 error pages per second right. Well, there you go
[06:59.600 --> 07:04.400]  That's that's just kind of pressuring but the thing and so Brent Simmons was in the same boat
[07:04.400 --> 07:09.440]  And I will return to this because one of the reasons I'm so interested by overcast is I do see some
[07:09.440 --> 07:13.600]  Fair number of similarities situation wise with Vesper
[07:15.280 --> 07:17.280]  and design wise even but
[07:17.520 --> 07:22.640]  One of the things was that Brent has built large-scale so you know online things, you know, there's net news
[07:23.040 --> 07:26.080]  Why are sinking some of the other stuff he did in his gator?
[07:26.960 --> 07:30.720]  So I felt really good being you know having nothing to do with writing the code
[07:32.160 --> 07:36.360]  Bedding on Brent Simmons and it did work out. We had a great launch the sink all went fine
[07:36.360 --> 07:41.960]  And I would have been just as happy betting on you know overcast and Marco armant having a good thing
[07:42.440 --> 07:48.040]  Because experience really matters but on the other hand and Brent, you know, I had a couple of these things in mind
[07:49.960 --> 07:56.040]  Especially for online stuff every couple of years the state-of-the-art changes and there's little things that are new and different
[07:56.040 --> 08:01.960]  Right it didn't used to be that you could go to line out and say you know what give me a couple of extra database service
[08:02.360 --> 08:04.760]  You couldn't do that. Oh, yeah, right and so
[08:04.760 --> 08:10.760]  In in in large part and I think the reason by both of those launches went well those things work really well
[08:11.240 --> 08:16.360]  But you just never know because there might be something there might be something that you overlook because it's that's what bugs are
[08:16.360 --> 08:22.360]  Bugs are always things that you overlook and you can say here's all the here's the seven things that have bit me before
[08:22.360 --> 08:25.080]  Scaling wise and I'm gonna make sure all seven of these I've handled well
[08:25.320 --> 08:29.240]  There might be a new one an eighth one that you don't know about and then all of a sudden
[08:29.400 --> 08:32.520]  You've got a big launch all these websites are writing about you
[08:32.520 --> 08:35.480]  You're on the front page of this website that website
[08:36.280 --> 08:40.920]  all sorts of Twitter's going nuts people talking about it and your server is down and
[08:41.880 --> 08:46.520]  Yeah, it would you know you probably would be much less happy Marco
[08:46.920 --> 08:49.240]  Oh, yeah, and you know because the difference like I mean
[08:49.240 --> 08:52.520]  I did a beta test with about 40 people for about two months and
[08:53.000 --> 08:58.680]  40 people because Apple has not as far as I know rolled out that new testing thing at the bay made test flight into no
[08:58.680 --> 09:05.240]  So you're still limited to a hundred device slots. So 40 people if you want to leave any room for anyone to get new phones in the fall or anyone to
[09:05.240 --> 09:07.880]  Have an iPad that's about as big of a group as you can do and
[09:08.840 --> 09:13.960]  You know, I I this was the biggest beta I've ever done by a long shot the longest beta
[09:13.960 --> 09:18.680]  I've ever done and the beta and cut didn't cover tons of issues and which I'm very thankful for
[09:19.240 --> 09:20.760]  and
[09:20.760 --> 09:25.160]  Yet there were there are still bugs that none of us found because the difference between
[09:25.720 --> 09:27.400]  40 people and
[09:27.400 --> 09:29.640]  You know 30,000 people is
[09:30.360 --> 09:33.160]  Substantial and out of the and out of the 40
[09:33.640 --> 09:36.920]  You know, we were mostly it was mostly people. I know like you and you know
[09:36.920 --> 09:40.840]  They're like tech people so it wasn't a very diverse group and so certain things like
[09:41.320 --> 09:44.520]  We just never ran into because that isn't how we use the podcast app
[09:44.840 --> 09:49.480]  You know, whereas a lot of people do or into that any any that's part of a problem of
[09:49.480 --> 09:53.880]  I'd love to hear an example of that if you can think of one that's good like if there's like already like a
[09:54.600 --> 09:56.600]  frequently
[09:56.600 --> 09:59.160]  Run into oh, yeah sharp edge or something like that
[10:00.760 --> 10:06.120]  What do you think? What do you think the average a number of podcasts is that somebody subscribes to
[10:07.400 --> 10:08.600]  three
[10:08.600 --> 10:12.760]  Yeah, I mean you're ruling out anyone who's who does zero, you know, obviously, right?
[10:14.200 --> 10:16.920]  So I don't I don't have that number available for overcast yet
[10:16.920 --> 10:19.480]  However, I have heard from many people
[10:20.120 --> 10:26.040]  Apparently my opml importer is having problems for people who have opml files
[10:26.040 --> 10:30.120]  That have like a hundred feeds in them and there's a lot of these people who keep telling me this
[10:31.160 --> 10:35.240]  And I like I listen to my my feed list is about
[10:35.480 --> 10:41.800]  35 or 40 long because a lot of those are shows that that are retired or on hiatus or a lot of them are shows that I like
[10:41.800 --> 10:43.960]  I had one episode of but I didn't subscribe to the whole show
[10:44.520 --> 10:46.520]  And they they're still in my list. I haven't deleted them
[10:47.480 --> 10:49.720]  And so the number of podcasts I listen to
[10:49.720 --> 10:58.840]  Actively that you know that that that should produce new episodes every week. It's probably about 10 maybe and that I consider myself a heavy podcast listener
[10:59.720 --> 11:01.720]  but
[11:01.720 --> 11:05.320]  Compared to the general public like there are these edge cases out there
[11:05.320 --> 11:10.840]  There are these people who listen to over a hundred one guy complained that his had over 150 and I couldn't import it properly
[11:11.560 --> 11:17.560]  And I just never considered and that also that also creates problems, you know, the my
[11:17.560 --> 11:19.560]  The problem with opml
[11:20.280 --> 11:22.280]  Is that there's no way to specify
[11:22.600 --> 11:27.720]  Episodes you can only say which podcast you subscribe to it's another way in other words
[11:27.720 --> 11:33.080]  It's the the URL of the podcast feed not the correct URL of the episode
[11:33.560 --> 11:38.600]  Correct, and that's it and so it the opml standard cannot communicate to you know between apps
[11:39.160 --> 11:43.960]  What you know whether you've heard all the episodes or not which ones are unplayed how far you've gotten in them
[11:43.960 --> 11:50.600]  It only knows which podcasts you subscribe to period. That's it. Well, that's not and to be pedantic here
[11:50.600 --> 11:52.040]  I'll fill in for a circusa
[11:52.200 --> 11:59.480]  It's not really a limit of opml in general because I believe opml is a general purpose outlineer file format
[11:59.640 --> 12:05.480]  It's it's the specific flavor of opml that is widely understood as the lingua Frank
[12:05.960 --> 12:07.480]  Prankua. How do you say that lingua?
[12:07.480 --> 12:16.760]  Franka of sharing of sharing a list of feeds that you subscribe to and that's it's true for RSS readers too
[12:17.240 --> 12:20.680]  It's probably the exact same format and and there's actually a very good reason why
[12:21.800 --> 12:29.400]  Nobody's implemented episode exporting and importing. It's mostly because there is no good way to uniquely identify the episodes
[12:29.960 --> 12:33.560]  Yeah, I would imagine because GUI. These are not required in the standards
[12:33.560 --> 12:40.920]  So so there's and there's a lot of feeds that do GUI these wrong anyway and aren't there some feeds that you couldn't even use the URL
[12:41.080 --> 12:47.120]  For the audio file because there's some aren't there some shows where they'll give it and they'll they'll put two in and they'll say like
[12:47.120 --> 12:50.720]  Here's here's two different formats mp3 and m4a. Oh, yeah
[12:50.720 --> 12:55.000]  There's even still some people who put in ag vorbus and then there's there's a new format called ag
[12:55.240 --> 12:57.720]  Opus I think I didn't I didn't even hear of until yesterday
[12:58.280 --> 13:01.080]  I don't know how popular it is, but yeah, just to give you
[13:01.080 --> 13:08.360]  I think that tells you how popular it is, but yeah, but yeah, and so like there's and you know now
[13:08.360 --> 13:12.840]  I'm dealing with broken feeds, you know feeds that have clearly broken mark-up
[13:14.040 --> 13:18.920]  But you know that people are angry about that. I don't support and so I have to figure out how to support them and it's a mess
[13:18.920 --> 13:24.120]  But anyway, so the one of the biggest complaints I've gotten is from people who subscribe to a lot of shows
[13:24.120 --> 13:33.520]  My my default behavior when importing of a PML is I will assume that you want the one most recent episode in every one of those feeds listed
[13:34.680 --> 13:36.680]  That is a bad assumption
[13:36.680 --> 13:40.320]  Yep, and and so when you have a hundred and fifty feeds
[13:40.320 --> 13:43.160]  I try to immediately download a hundred and fifty episodes
[13:43.160 --> 13:48.200]  And people are complaining that I'm filling up their phones because all of a sudden they have three gigs of podcast
[13:48.200 --> 13:54.280]  Downloader after their import and and I don't have like a bulk cancel operation and
[13:54.280 --> 13:59.960]  Again, this is something that that is a valid problem. I didn't think of it. It never came up in beta
[13:59.960 --> 14:05.320]  I have to figure out some good way to solve that now, but that is very much a valid problem
[14:06.040 --> 14:12.040]  Yeah, and I'm a I was a bad tester for that because I don't keep like an archive of
[14:12.040 --> 14:17.480]  Old shows like I don't want I don't have a subscription to hyper critical anymore
[14:17.560 --> 14:22.920]  Just because I want to go back and listen to if I do it might strike me my fancy someday
[14:22.920 --> 14:25.880]  But then I would I wouldn't think I want to have subscription to it
[14:25.880 --> 14:28.840]  I would think I'll go into directory find it
[14:29.400 --> 14:32.760]  Find the episode I want and play and then add it there
[14:32.760 --> 14:37.240]  I would never think I want to even though I understand the mindset that someone would want to do that
[14:37.240 --> 14:42.280]  Here's the hundred and fifty podcasts. I've ever been interested in and I want to move this file around from app to app
[14:42.840 --> 14:49.640]  My mind that that seems crazy to me a new I kind of like the idea of switching and trying a new podcast app
[14:49.640 --> 14:56.680]  Everyone's in a while just to start clean and say here. Let me find two or three shows. I want to listen to I've got a long drive ahead of me
[14:57.240 --> 14:59.960]  Right, and I think it's easier because you know despite those outliers
[15:00.360 --> 15:05.720]  You know like RSS has always had that problem where usually people listen there are people subscribe to
[15:05.720 --> 15:11.560]  Usually a pretty good number of RSS feeds if they use it at all like I subscribe to probably 200 RSS feeds and again
[15:11.560 --> 15:13.720]  Most of them don't update every day, so it's easy to follow
[15:15.320 --> 15:23.080]  But podcasts, you know, there's there's a limit on how many podcasts you can listen to on a regular basis and so I always assume the numbers
[15:23.080 --> 15:29.080]  Would be substantially lower for your number of podcasts feeds that most people will be subscribed to I assume that would be a very low number
[15:29.720 --> 15:33.520]  And yeah turns out not necessarily a safe assumption
[15:33.520 --> 15:41.760]  So what what they want is they want to be able to maybe even default to zero downloads per podcast and then go through and then
[15:42.160 --> 15:43.680]  Change it from there
[15:43.680 --> 15:50.840]  Right, and I think honestly, I mean a safe default might be zero and just just make people pick one from everything
[15:50.840 --> 15:57.720]  You know, like I think my assumption that you want the latest one from everything is probably problematic enough that I should probably change it
[15:57.720 --> 16:03.160]  Because I can change that one server side. Yeah, maybe that's a good one that you'd want to do if I add and just a
[16:03.160 --> 16:04.840]  Single new subscription in the app
[16:05.560 --> 16:11.760]  Maybe assume I want to get the most recent episode, but if I'm importing an OPML file don't assume I want any of the episodes
[16:12.440 --> 16:15.560]  Yeah, I mean that's that is certainly well actually no
[16:15.560 --> 16:20.040]  I think I think my default behavior now is that if you tap subscribe on our new show
[16:20.040 --> 16:24.040]  I download the latest episode if you add it from the directory which so that I think that is a safe assumption
[16:24.040 --> 16:29.440]  But yeah, I think you're right with OPML it I think I think it isn't so yeah, I think maybe I'll change that later tonight after I'm done with you
[16:29.440 --> 16:31.440]  Yeah
[16:32.960 --> 16:37.520]  That leads directly to another question I've had and I've seen it and I'm not even following
[16:37.920 --> 16:42.000]  Anywhere nearly as religiously as I'm sure you are on Twitter the day one
[16:42.480 --> 16:46.840]  Commentary about it, but I've seen a lot of people remark about the lack of streaming
[16:47.920 --> 16:50.960]  Yes, that that is a big one and I
[16:50.960 --> 16:58.480]  Again, I never really noticed I guess I have because I guess there have been times like I've been trying to
[17:00.400 --> 17:07.040]  To run on a more regular basis and I that's you know one of the times where I do listen to podcasts and it'll be like hey
[17:07.040 --> 17:09.880]  I know that there's got to be a new ATP out
[17:11.320 --> 17:13.320]  Let me go look and
[17:13.720 --> 17:17.600]  There it is and I do I have to wait until I get the whole thing before I go out
[17:17.600 --> 17:21.760]  But I don't have to wait that long that it would ever even have occurred to me to
[17:22.480 --> 17:27.120]  You know right in as a suggestion that I would like to just leave the house and have it stream over
[17:27.120 --> 17:32.800]  LTE or something like that because it doesn't take that long for you know a hundred and some megabyte
[17:33.840 --> 17:37.720]  File, but it seems like lots of people want that what they want is
[17:38.440 --> 17:41.520]  They want it to start downloading and playing at the same time. Oh
[17:41.920 --> 17:43.920]  Yeah, and streaming it's
[17:43.920 --> 17:49.080]  You know, it isn't there because it's it's hard to do and I didn't have time to do it and it's going to take months to do it
[17:49.080 --> 17:50.840]  Right, that's why it's not there
[17:50.840 --> 17:54.720]  You know a lot of people will assume that I just forgot to add it of just some oversight, right, just
[17:58.640 --> 18:04.280]  Checkbox that's what I figured the answer is that the answer is that it's not it's like a lot of these things
[18:04.280 --> 18:11.240]  It's not easy. It's really hard and and it's harder for me because of my audio engine like it's it's easier for the other players
[18:11.240 --> 18:14.760]  That that don't use the low-level stuff that I do to do my audio effects
[18:15.080 --> 18:19.080]  It's easier for them, but it's a lot easier for them. The way I'm going to have to do it is going to be more
[18:19.640 --> 18:22.440]  Manual like I'm going to build more of those parts from scratch, but
[18:23.320 --> 18:25.320]  the main argument for it
[18:25.320 --> 18:31.360]  I mean first of all, I think the I think the need for it is exaggerated on day one because so many people
[18:31.960 --> 18:35.880]  Want to just jump in and try some and try playing it and they have to wait for their files to download
[18:35.880 --> 18:41.360]  Whereas if you just use the app regularly most new episodes you'll get we push to you in the background
[18:41.360 --> 18:44.720]  And you won't even notice them downloading about time. You know you long see the app next. They're just there
[18:45.400 --> 18:50.920]  So you know background download. I think removes much of the need, but there are still situations where you need
[18:51.640 --> 18:53.640]  Where streaming is very nice to have
[18:53.880 --> 18:59.680]  the big two are immediate feedback like if you just want it to add an episode and listen to it right now
[18:59.760 --> 19:04.440]  Like right as you add it then you want to hear it you can start playing it immediately and then the second big one is
[19:04.440 --> 19:05.680]  is
[19:05.680 --> 19:08.240]  if you like a lot of the other clients offer a
[19:08.640 --> 19:15.320]  Streaming only mode where nothing is ever downloaded you only ever stream things and that way you don't use any disk space
[19:15.760 --> 19:17.560]  See neither that would never be going to hurt me
[19:18.120 --> 19:22.280]  And it's it's a really good idea and like it you know if you think about you know for me
[19:22.280 --> 19:23.600]  I would never use it because I you know
[19:23.600 --> 19:29.560]  I have I live in an area that has spotty reception and I often you know travel and go up state or on a plane or something
[19:29.560 --> 19:33.640]  And so I I I want everything to be just downloaded and there and ready
[19:33.640 --> 19:36.960]  But a lot of people don't work that way a lot of people
[19:37.800 --> 19:41.360]  Want everything to always only be streamed and leave all the space free on their phone
[19:41.360 --> 19:45.960]  And we'll see what happens like with iOS 8 with the new photo management thing
[19:46.760 --> 19:52.320]  You know, maybe maybe there won't be as much of a space crunch on iOS devices as there used to be who knows
[19:53.080 --> 19:55.800]  But either way I am gonna add streaming. It's just a matter of
[19:55.800 --> 20:04.000]  Of doing it because you get probably gonna take a few months. Yeah, it seems like there's that that's actually sort of under the radar like one of the big
[20:05.640 --> 20:11.240]  Priorities of iOS 8 is space management because they're doing it to similar thing. They're doing with
[20:12.720 --> 20:14.080]  messages
[20:14.080 --> 20:21.400]  Where it's defaulting to not keeping the images and other attachments that you've been sent and I think
[20:21.400 --> 20:27.240]  part of that is a sort of trend towards privacy in general and
[20:27.720 --> 20:33.200]  You know things like snapchat and stuff like that where it works like that and people seem to like it and maybe it
[20:33.200 --> 20:37.280]  Just never occurred to them before but I think another big part of it is that you know even for me
[20:37.280 --> 20:39.280]  It's not like a super heavy texture, but
[20:40.480 --> 20:46.080]  Whiscus and I communicate a lot about Vesparo. I've got tons of screenshots in my eye messages with him
[20:46.080 --> 20:51.480]  If I look in the usage, I do have a couple of gigabytes
[20:51.480 --> 20:56.800]  I don't know for four four five gigabytes in messages and there's no way to get them to get them out
[20:56.800 --> 21:01.640]  I mean, I think you go through one by one, but you know that that's that way lies madness
[21:01.640 --> 21:06.360]  Right, or you can delete the entire conversation with Dave Whiscus and lose that entire history. Yeah
[21:06.600 --> 21:11.120]  Which I don't want to do. Yeah, and and it's also the way the weird way
[21:11.120 --> 21:16.720]  I message works where I've actually got like seven conversations with Whiscus. I don't know if they're based on different
[21:16.720 --> 21:21.920]  You know like his phone number to my Apple ID my Apple ID to his Apple ID
[21:21.920 --> 21:26.000]  I don't I don't know quite know how that counts, but everyone you know that would be less
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.640]  I would probably be easier to delete seven conversations with him, but
[21:30.320 --> 21:34.000]  But you know who knows how much of those gigabytes is all sorts of other people too
[21:34.000 --> 21:35.760]  And I'd have to keep deleting all those things
[21:35.760 --> 21:40.600]  I don't know one thing I don't know and I would love to know the answer to maybe somebody who's upgraded their
[21:40.600 --> 21:46.600]  Regular phone to iOS 8 betas would know whether that applies to your old messages
[21:46.680 --> 21:53.960]  Like if you upgrade your phone to iOS 8 well that that new world only applied to new messages as they come in or
[21:53.960 --> 21:58.080]  Is iOS 8 going to do something smart about your archive of
[21:58.600 --> 21:59.720]  Fold images
[21:59.720 --> 22:05.320]  That's a tough one because you certainly you could see the other problem is like you know if if they just default to
[22:05.640 --> 22:09.060]  All right, we're just gonna stop keeping all old stuff by default
[22:09.060 --> 22:13.340]  Then it's you need to upgrade to iOS 8 all your old messages get deleted and that's
[22:13.540 --> 22:15.540]  That's kind of bad
[22:15.540 --> 22:18.580]  So I can see the problem there right it's one thing if
[22:19.140 --> 22:23.300]  New messages start coming in with that little keep button and you you know
[22:23.300 --> 22:24.980]  Even if you don't quite notice it right away
[22:24.980 --> 22:29.220]  Well, it was there and you had the opportunity to press keep it's another thing to say
[22:29.220 --> 22:32.860]  Yeah, all those messages you got over the last three years that
[22:33.300 --> 22:36.020]  You never even had to worry about whether they were gonna be kept or not
[22:36.020 --> 22:38.980]  You you knew they were gonna be kept. Yeah. We did you a favor and delete them
[22:39.700 --> 22:42.180]  Right, I mean, I think what would probably make more sense
[22:42.980 --> 22:49.140]  Would be to treat those attachments just like entries in your photos library where
[22:49.700 --> 22:55.540]  They are all kept on iCloud and then they can just be pulled down on demand if you if you actually scroll up and go like
[22:55.540 --> 23:00.420]  You know three years back in history. They can be pulled off the off the network. Yeah, that would make that makes a lot of sense
[23:00.420 --> 23:01.540]  Have it use your storage
[23:01.540 --> 23:07.620]  But unfortunately with some people that might use a ton of storage right. Yeah, I was just about to say the problem is that it for a lot of
[23:07.620 --> 23:13.620]  People a couple of gigs of I message images is probably pretty close to the number of gigs
[23:13.620 --> 23:15.620]  I have in in their iCloud storage
[23:15.860 --> 23:21.220]  Right exactly. Yeah, and there's also a lot of duplication. I think like like if you send a picture to somebody
[23:21.940 --> 23:23.940]  Do you now have two copies of that in your storage
[23:24.900 --> 23:30.260]  Like like the one in your camera roll and then when you sent them I don't know like I don't know how that works. Yeah, I do think that
[23:30.260 --> 23:33.020]  Well, that's a good question. I think you might
[23:36.020 --> 23:41.300]  Because it might also I don't even know I actually never even checked whether they like shrink them at all or anything
[23:41.300 --> 23:43.220]  I don't think they do
[23:43.220 --> 23:48.260]  But I don't know that's a good question and when you do get a copy like when you you definitely get a dupe when
[23:48.500 --> 23:54.740]  You take the photo with your phone and then you switch to your iPad or your Mac or something and the
[23:54.740 --> 24:02.020]  Conversation is over there too. That's obviously a copy of the image. Right exactly. Yeah, I don't know. It's a good question
[24:03.060 --> 24:08.180]  Obviously something you have to concern yourself about though. That's one area where you know overcast
[24:08.180 --> 24:10.180]  I think it's in a unique situation where
[24:13.060 --> 24:20.340]  You know you some some users might reasonably want overcast to literally take up a majority of the storage on their device
[24:20.340 --> 24:29.260]  You know somebody with a 64 gigabyte iPhone might might actually want a podcast app that that stores about 40 gigabytes of
[24:29.460 --> 24:30.740]  Podcasts, right
[24:30.740 --> 24:34.060]  You know, especially if you're going on a trip or something and you're gonna be without coverage
[24:34.060 --> 24:39.980]  You're going internationally. You don't want to use data roaming or you're just going out for a while and you're in a country
[24:39.980 --> 24:43.980]  Where cell coverage or cell data is very expensive, you know, either way
[24:44.500 --> 24:48.140]  You know, there are so many reasons why you want it downloaded and
[24:48.140 --> 24:53.020]  Why you want it to be taking that space in your phone rather than requiring it to be streamed constantly
[24:53.260 --> 24:59.340]  but the other side of that is probably just as frequent which as you have you know a 16 gig device and it's full and
[24:59.780 --> 25:05.740]  You want it down its podcast and you don't have enough space and that sucks and so like I can see both sides of the argument
[25:05.940 --> 25:07.220]  but
[25:07.220 --> 25:09.700]  There's also a problem in having the app
[25:10.380 --> 25:17.660]  offer a very healthy blend of those two things because then everything becomes way more complicated both the both the code
[25:17.660 --> 25:22.380]  and the interface because then you have to you have to like manage these states and offer ways for people to like
[25:22.980 --> 25:24.980]  transform or stream into a download or
[25:25.100 --> 25:32.140]  You know delete something believe it's streamable and all these things that really complicate the interface and and the data model and then and even
[25:32.420 --> 25:36.780]  The mental model of the user as to to know like do I have this thing or not?
[25:37.420 --> 25:39.500]  That's I'm trying to keep it very simple
[25:40.060 --> 25:42.060]  so that people can
[25:42.060 --> 25:47.300]  Can know what what's happening. They can know what they have by looking at it. They can see they can tell okay
[25:47.300 --> 25:53.180]  I have this file and they can be kind of assured of that and they can depend on that, you know, but it's it's hard
[25:53.180 --> 25:56.260]  This and this is why podcasts after so challenging to make I think because
[25:56.780 --> 26:01.660]  It's one of those categories like to do lists where like it seems simple at first and then you start getting
[26:02.260 --> 26:07.500]  Request from people and you start realizing wait a minute. There is not only is there no way to satisfy all of them
[26:07.500 --> 26:11.820]  No, like like any change you make is going to satisfy this group, but anger this other group
[26:12.580 --> 26:15.740]  But also that the problem space is so
[26:16.620 --> 26:22.780]  Complicated of what somebody might want and exactly how they might want it that there is infinite potential for
[26:23.500 --> 26:27.660]  Improvement for every person no one is ever 100% satisfied with their podcast at
[26:28.700 --> 26:33.140]  Everyone's always like 60% satisfied and I'm you know, so I made one that
[26:33.140 --> 26:37.060]  Satisfies my 60% I'm very happy with it
[26:38.180 --> 26:42.780]  But it's it's never gonna appeal to everyone and it's not even close
[26:42.780 --> 26:49.180]  I think that's another it's one of the broad areas where I see it is similar to Vesper and that there's a ton of
[26:49.860 --> 26:54.460]  Notes apps and looting one that ships with the system from Apple
[26:55.980 --> 26:59.540]  That's not horrible, you know, and it is there. It's you know
[26:59.540 --> 27:05.220]  It's it's at least you know one of the things I like about it though is at least you see where Apple's coming from with it
[27:05.220 --> 27:09.620]  So you don't have to worry like it's more worrisome if Apple doesn't have an app in your category
[27:10.020 --> 27:13.260]  Right like it was then you're always wondering like either
[27:13.540 --> 27:19.740]  Why isn't there an app in my category? Just my category suck that badly or what will happen if they make one?
[27:19.740 --> 27:23.780]  Like then they'll crush us all, you know and even if it ends up not being crushing
[27:23.860 --> 27:29.300]  It's it's stressful like you must have gone through that with the reading list because you start hearing about it
[27:29.300 --> 27:33.900]  Before it comes out, then they announce it and then you have to worry well how popular is it going to be?
[27:33.900 --> 27:36.500]  It's coming out in three months when the beta is over
[27:37.060 --> 27:38.900]  and
[27:38.900 --> 27:44.020]  It's stressful. I mean, I you know, it's better to know that wow here's Apple's podcast app
[27:44.020 --> 27:50.860]  And here's all the reasons I don't like it and I know that there's a lot of other people who don't like it and they're probably not going to
[27:51.660 --> 27:54.060]  Wipe it out and start over. I don't think
[27:54.060 --> 28:00.140]  Well, and and you know there there are things about Apple's podcast app that are the way they are
[28:00.700 --> 28:06.660]  Because that's how Apple does things or because there's a strategy tax in place like there's there's a certain amount of
[28:08.460 --> 28:15.820]  Cludginess in the app that is entirely because it has to use the iTunes podcast directory right and it has to be tied so
[28:16.180 --> 28:18.180]  so firmly to that and
[28:18.180 --> 28:24.340]  so like they can't do anything that that like breaks that it has to cater to a casual
[28:24.340 --> 28:30.900]  I don't even I don't even know what a podcast is yet person in search arrays and it also it has to it has to cater to
[28:31.300 --> 28:37.220]  every territory in the world every language in the world every genre of podcasts in the world and
[28:39.060 --> 28:46.380]  It and like you know think about like whenever the podcast app team wants to get something changed or improved about the
[28:46.380 --> 28:48.100]  API to the store
[28:48.100 --> 28:50.100]  How likely is that to really happen?
[28:50.100 --> 28:54.420]  You know like inside Apple, you know that the iTunes store team has enough to do
[28:54.500 --> 28:59.540]  Do you think if the podcast team if the podcast app on iOS team makes a request?
[29:00.020 --> 29:03.580]  How how high our priority is that really to the iTunes store team?
[29:03.580 --> 29:08.980]  It's that's all this other stuff to do with you know the more high profile thing like the app store and the music store
[29:08.980 --> 29:10.820]  you know and so
[29:10.820 --> 29:15.140]  The Apple podcast app is always going to be limited by that plus it's limited by apples
[29:15.140 --> 29:18.940]  like 80% strategy. Yeah, you know, they're they're never going to do
[29:19.620 --> 29:21.620]  features that are as
[29:21.620 --> 29:28.500]  Nerdy as like my playlists like the way I do playlists. It's so crazy with all like these filters and everything and it's it's a playlist
[29:29.100 --> 29:33.900]  System for nerds and Apple's never gonna do one like that because that's not the way they do things. Yeah
[29:33.900 --> 29:36.180]  I don't think so either and in fact it might even
[29:37.540 --> 29:42.740]  Might even be problematic for them in the way that their podcast app for iOS
[29:42.740 --> 29:45.380]  is
[29:45.380 --> 29:47.380]  Has like this weird
[29:47.580 --> 29:51.740]  Relationship with iTunes on Mac and Windows, which is where you look, you know
[29:51.740 --> 29:57.820]  Apple's solution for how you listen to podcasts on your Mac or PC where playlists has a very different word
[29:58.340 --> 30:00.340]  I mean, maybe they could just add
[30:00.340 --> 30:06.740]  I guess they could maybe piggyback on playlists that include audio file, you know regular audio files from your library or whatever
[30:06.740 --> 30:09.860]  But that just turns it into more of a mess in my mind
[30:09.860 --> 30:13.500]  Right, and well, that's why like when the Apple the Apple podcast
[30:13.500 --> 30:15.620]  I've added something. I believe they call it channels
[30:15.740 --> 30:21.700]  Which is basically a smart playlist. It's you can just select like select which feeds go into this and that's your playlist
[30:22.700 --> 30:25.980]  And they add that to the podcast and I think the reason they had to call it channels
[30:25.980 --> 30:30.100]  Yeah, that's probably mean something else in the in iTunes land. I I never thought about that
[30:30.100 --> 30:32.300]  I was always confused as held by their channels
[30:32.300 --> 30:34.380]  I thought their channels were a little bit more like
[30:34.380 --> 30:41.340]  Category is in the store and and I think that's why I found it so confusing is that they're not really categories in the store
[30:41.340 --> 30:46.860]  They are probably more like it would have made more sense to me if they call them channels and then in parentheses playlists
[30:47.300 --> 30:54.620]  Yeah, smart playlist. That's what they are. They're smart playlists for podcasts. It's has there ever been anything in the history of technology
[30:55.500 --> 30:57.500]  after the television
[30:57.500 --> 31:02.860]  Where the word channels was used for something that ended up being a success. Oh, that's an excellent question
[31:02.860 --> 31:09.140]  Because it's been used in a bunch of like half-assed terrible things like the windows 98 channels bar on active desktop
[31:09.140 --> 31:13.580]  Yeah, anybody who's listening to the show actually remembers that you don't because you were a Mac person
[31:13.580 --> 31:15.580]  I never saw it now. No, it was very lucky
[31:16.900 --> 31:17.940]  Imagine
[31:17.940 --> 31:23.060]  Imagine Microsoft at its worst at a time when when PC hardware was at its worst
[31:23.900 --> 31:25.100]  where
[31:25.100 --> 31:27.420]  The software was trying to do way too much
[31:27.420 --> 31:35.380]  Web technologies were brand new and this is when Microsoft tried to integrate i.e. into the desktop so that the desktop was basically a giant web view
[31:35.740 --> 31:40.820]  On hardware that was like a penny M90 with 16 megs of RAM
[31:41.340 --> 31:43.020]  like it
[31:43.020 --> 31:48.300]  It was it was an awful time to be a PC user and and there are many awful times to be a PC user
[31:48.300 --> 31:54.540]  But I think like 1997 was a particularly awful one. That's pretty bad for being a Mac user too
[31:54.540 --> 32:01.860]  Yeah, at their point just a bad year for computers or as Steve jobs called it in the interview and the interview with crinsley a dark ages of
[32:02.260 --> 32:09.140]  Computing yeah, exactly yeah, he was not that far off about that. I was bad for everybody. You know next had like three developers
[32:10.060 --> 32:14.740]  Like a really cool system in like six apps and they were super expensive
[32:15.060 --> 32:17.300]  You know the machines that could run it
[32:18.300 --> 32:23.500]  Maybe by 97 I guess they ran on PCs. It was net next step or open step
[32:23.500 --> 32:26.180]  But like no market whatsoever
[32:27.660 --> 32:35.380]  Max were part of a company that was dying and had no no no real operating system no modern operating system and
[32:36.100 --> 32:39.100]  Then Microsoft Microsoft was so powerful
[32:39.900 --> 32:47.580]  And they just they ship windows 98 they just gave into all of their worst impulses so bad. It was so so bad
[32:47.580 --> 32:54.300]  And and the internet was you know the internet was so new in 97 that everyone was like the most used application
[32:54.300 --> 32:56.660]  New on your computer were started to become the web browser
[32:56.660 --> 33:01.140]  But web browsers were so bad and the hardware was so primitive and they had there was no RAM
[33:01.140 --> 33:02.140]  So just
[33:02.140 --> 33:08.100]  1997 just sounds like hard drives grinding as everything just swamps constantly that's that's the entire year
[33:08.100 --> 33:10.900]  Everything we just swapping for a year and waiting for dial-up
[33:11.220 --> 33:12.820]  Yeah, exactly that's who we have
[33:12.820 --> 33:14.820]  Oh
[33:16.620 --> 33:22.740]  My god things that you just could not even imagine explaining to your kids today would be the
[33:23.300 --> 33:29.940]  Dial-up dial-up. This is impossible. You can't explain slow internet, but dial-up was so much worse than being slow because I remember being
[33:31.020 --> 33:39.420]  I can't remember when I eventually I think we eventually Amy I eventually broke down and bought a second phone line got a second number just for internet
[33:39.420 --> 33:45.980]  But I remember it just you know, and I understand this stuff and I was able to set up a thing
[33:45.980 --> 33:53.060]  Oh, I'm gonna I'm gonna draw a blank on the software, but it was by a great indie Mac developer named Peter Sichol
[33:53.060 --> 33:56.140]  I don't have to take a moment here and Google this and look it up
[33:56.620 --> 34:03.660]  But he had this great Mac utility that would let you share a dial-up with multiple max on your local network
[34:03.660 --> 34:09.580]  So Amy and I could both get on the internet at the same time and she could just she didn't have the modem hooked up
[34:09.580 --> 34:11.100]  The hope modem was hooked up to my machine
[34:11.100 --> 34:15.080]  But she could just get on the internet go check email and then you know
[34:15.260 --> 34:17.380]  Wait the 90 seconds for the whole thing
[34:17.380 --> 34:22.460]  But then she'd have internet, you know with just one modem shared between us and we could both be on at the same time
[34:22.980 --> 34:27.260]  Yeah, that was unheard of back then. Oh, it was a game changer was awesome
[34:28.660 --> 34:33.580]  This is where I need I need the forum that you guys have the live audience because somebody would
[34:33.580 --> 34:35.580]  Yeah, the chat
[34:35.580 --> 34:42.780]  I don't know. This is pretty obscure even our chat. I'm not sure. Yeah, but I just feel like Peter Sichol S I C H E L sustainable softworks
[34:42.780 --> 34:44.780]  Let me see what I
[34:44.780 --> 34:48.900]  Don't remember the name of it, but it I'll give you I'll give a shout out to it
[34:48.900 --> 34:53.100]  He's still got his URL Sustworks S U S T work.com
[34:55.380 --> 34:58.540]  I used to have to I we only had one phone line on my house
[34:58.540 --> 35:03.340]  And I was I was like in seventh grade and I didn't do that 1997 so it's a little bit different
[35:03.340 --> 35:06.260]  I couldn't just buy another phone line. We only had one phone line
[35:06.260 --> 35:13.420]  And my mom had a lot of friends who would call her all the time and and so I was not allowed to disable call waiting
[35:16.060 --> 35:19.540]  I had to and it was an external modem. So anybody calls your house
[35:20.100 --> 35:21.700]  Yeah, I had I had to listen
[35:21.700 --> 35:26.660]  I had to leave the you could you could figure the modem in its string to leave the speaker on all the time
[35:26.660 --> 35:31.620]  Instead of turning off after it connects. So the whole time. I was just sitting there listening to static like
[35:32.620 --> 35:37.660]  And then you could hear beep if a call waiting came in and I had to listen for that
[35:37.660 --> 35:38.700]  And if I heard a beep
[35:38.700 --> 35:43.300]  I had to flick the modem off so it would hang up immediately and let the phone ring and pick it up and you know
[35:43.340 --> 35:46.260]  Then just not be on the internet for the next 20 minutes during this phone call
[35:47.780 --> 35:54.860]  I've got it here. It's IP net router to complete IP router and firewall solution including a built in DHCP server
[35:54.860 --> 36:00.900]  Nat with inbound port mapping and IP filtering to set up your own firewall. I think it costs like 40 bucks
[36:01.420 --> 36:08.960]  I mean, what was it here? There's a comment from so it was 89 bucks. It was a steal. It was 89 bucks and you you had
[36:09.420 --> 36:10.780]  Superpowers
[36:10.780 --> 36:12.780]  But now that's a pretty advanced
[36:12.980 --> 36:17.460]  functionality and like a pretty advanced network stack for that time. Well that was it was built on
[36:18.060 --> 36:20.220]  I'm going way out in weeds here, but
[36:20.220 --> 36:24.180]  at Macho is nine for as crazy
[36:25.140 --> 36:32.140]  convoluted, you know a terrible bag of wires. It wasn't some areas under the hood had some amazing stuff
[36:32.500 --> 36:35.540]  I think it was called open transport was the networking stack
[36:35.620 --> 36:39.980]  So he didn't necessarily write the whole networking stack all the way to the bottom
[36:39.980 --> 36:43.540]  It was built on open transport, but his stuff was almost like
[36:43.540 --> 36:51.460]  Like like the flagship of why open transport was great and why a lot of Mac developers were
[36:53.500 --> 36:58.860]  Beside themselves when Mac OS 10 went with the you know the Unix
[37:00.500 --> 37:06.940]  Networking I forget that there was a whole controversy in that you know there were all these mini there's thousands of these little mini
[37:07.940 --> 37:13.500]  Controversies between classic the which parts of the classic Mac OS would stay in which part parts
[37:13.500 --> 37:16.300]  Of next step would stay, and that was one of them
[37:17.300 --> 37:21.540]  I kind of feel very lucky that I didn't even come to the Mac until
[37:22.020 --> 37:24.020]  10 for in
[37:24.020 --> 37:27.500]  2004 I and I bought an aluminum power book
[37:27.700 --> 37:32.180]  So like I didn't come to the Mac until it was awesome. Yeah, that's actually a good point
[37:32.300 --> 37:35.340]  Because there was it's like somebody coming to the iPhone with the 5S
[37:35.340 --> 37:39.980]  Yeah, it's like you've missed this whole history of like a little bit of rough patches here and there
[37:39.980 --> 37:46.220]  Although the iPhone was way easier. I think than being a Mac going around the 90s. Yeah, there were a couple of years in there
[37:46.580 --> 37:52.620]  Where it was and it really it was the early years of during fireball exactly around 2002 2003
[37:53.340 --> 37:56.860]  That's when I started, but maybe even count 2001 where
[37:59.660 --> 38:04.700]  Mac OS 9 was half awesome and half terrible and Mac OS 10 was
[38:04.700 --> 38:11.700]  Half terrible and half awesome, and you know, maybe those percentages were 60 40 40 60 and then they got 55 and eight
[38:11.700 --> 38:17.260]  You know, they shifted over time, but it took years for Mac OS 10 to really be overwhelmingly
[38:17.260 --> 38:23.140]  Yeah, you know what I just want to use it all all the time clearly and so it was you know
[38:23.300 --> 38:26.260]  Switching I remember for a while. I had two machines at my desk. I had a
[38:28.020 --> 38:32.140]  Forget what it was running Mac OS 10. I think it was a power book running Mac OS 10 and an
[38:32.140 --> 38:40.660]  old really old power Mac running Mac OS 9 and the older machine running Mac OS 9 of course felt way faster. Oh
[38:40.660 --> 38:42.660]  Yeah, so it's doing way less right
[38:43.220 --> 38:46.900]  Yeah, I mean and Microsoft to their credit like the 90s they had a similar
[38:47.820 --> 38:50.900]  Scale of transit well not somewhat they had a much easier transition
[38:50.900 --> 38:55.420]  But it was it was still a pretty substantial transition between the Windows 95 98
[38:55.420 --> 39:00.820]  Me kernel and the NT kernel that that powered 2000 and then XP and everything after XP
[39:00.820 --> 39:05.700]  And that like I was I was using it heavily during that transition and I was like
[39:05.700 --> 39:10.960]  I would be using the the beta of Windows 2000 and it was way more stable than Windows 98
[39:11.060 --> 39:14.860]  Yeah, I remember even at even like the very first beta of it in like February
[39:15.260 --> 39:19.140]  1999 was way way more stable than Windows 98 and
[39:20.380 --> 39:27.180]  But you know it was easier back than to go through that transition because Microsoft stuff was always mediocre like it was to give the
[39:27.180 --> 39:29.180]  You know to their credit. They were consistent
[39:29.180 --> 39:34.180]  You know whereas Apple it sounded you know sounds like they would have some some amazing times and then some terrible times whereas
[39:34.660 --> 39:38.460]  Microsoft was always impressively mediocre. It was like you could count in the mediocrity
[39:38.460 --> 39:41.260]  It was the you know it was the Starbucks and McDonald's of computer
[39:41.900 --> 39:45.460]  operating systems and I would argue probably still is and
[39:46.060 --> 39:49.100]  That's actually kind of valuable for a lot of people to know what you're going to get
[39:49.100 --> 39:53.660]  You know, it's it's dependable and and the transition, you know from 98 to
[39:54.220 --> 39:55.180]  2000
[39:55.180 --> 39:56.500]  was
[39:56.500 --> 40:01.220]  Not that bad unless you had to scan or print anything and they were no drivers
[40:01.220 --> 40:04.260]  But besides that if you as long as you didn't have to scan or print
[40:04.660 --> 40:06.660]  It was actually a really easy transition
[40:06.660 --> 40:12.180]  Yeah, I think that was the basic idea why they didn't go to NT even earlier because I even I actually had to use
[40:12.460 --> 40:16.840]  Windows in some ways like in college when I had jobs and stuff where you know that's what people used
[40:17.500 --> 40:20.580]  And I remember the first time I saw Windows NT
[40:20.580 --> 40:25.020]  I don't even know what the version number was but it was before 2000, but it was probably like NT
[40:25.020 --> 40:29.940]  4 or three I think because they numbered it yeah because they numbered it to match
[40:30.460 --> 40:35.300]  Windows 3 yeah NT 4 I believe or was NT 4 2000 or was that NT 5?
[40:35.300 --> 40:39.940]  It doesn't matter and I remember asking like the the guys who knew a lot more you know
[40:39.940 --> 40:43.980]  We're into the PC side. I was like why isn't everybody using this? This is actually like, you know
[40:43.980 --> 40:48.300]  It's not five. It's still oh. Yeah. That was it. That was it NT 5 was 2000
[40:48.300 --> 40:55.940]  Yeah, NT 4 was the one that that looked like when it was 95. Yeah, it was NT 4 that I that I had seen and used
[40:55.940 --> 40:58.100]  I had some experience with and I was like this is you know
[40:58.100 --> 41:01.940]  I still think it's kind of gross design wise but technically this is so far superior
[41:01.940 --> 41:05.180]  Why isn't everybody using this and then they were like, oh, there's no drivers for it?
[41:05.180 --> 41:09.860]  I was like, well, don't you say there's an easy way to solve this shouldn't everybody just
[41:10.540 --> 41:15.980]  Switch to this and then everybody will write drivers for it. It did I mean transitions are hard
[41:15.980 --> 41:20.460]  I know it's not but it just seemed crazy to me that they were in active development for someone here's by that
[41:20.460 --> 41:24.740]  And the PC world is I mean I don't it's probably better now. I'm not I'm actually not sure
[41:24.740 --> 41:26.740]  I've been out of it too long, but
[41:26.820 --> 41:30.140]  You actually couldn't count on new drivers for almost anything like if you upgraded
[41:30.700 --> 41:36.980]  Your version of windows you would probably almost certainly you'd have to get a new scanner at least like some of your hardware
[41:36.980 --> 41:42.580]  Would just stop working reliably or at all because then because they wouldn't put out a new driver or they would put out a new
[41:42.580 --> 41:49.380]  Data driver and then go out of business or something it would and like scanners were scanners and printers were some of the worst
[41:50.260 --> 41:51.780]  And then like it like the more
[41:52.580 --> 41:58.420]  Specialized your hardware peripherals were the worst they would be so like like I had a couple of game pads
[41:58.420 --> 42:04.300]  So I wanted to like play emulators. That's why I bought these game pads and they were always the absolute worst and
[42:04.900 --> 42:09.140]  So you could almost be sure that any any hardware or any time you upgraded your windows OS
[42:09.140 --> 42:17.060]  You'd have to also spend maybe 200 bucks upgrading some of your hardware because just just because of driver issues
[42:17.060 --> 42:23.260]  You'd have to replace perfectly working hardware just because there wouldn't be drivers anymore or they wouldn't be workable drivers anymore
[42:23.260 --> 42:30.940]  Crazy dark days and that's one of the reasons why Microsoft had to jump through hoops for backwards compatibility all that crap because that was the world
[42:30.940 --> 42:33.180]  They were operating and that was like the hardware environment
[42:33.180 --> 42:36.140]  They were operating and where they they couldn't just dictate to people
[42:36.140 --> 42:39.860]  You know what? Everyone's now using this so you have to catch up. You know the way Apple does that today
[42:40.460 --> 42:44.700]  Microsoft could not do that in in the 90s and I I don't even know if they can do it today
[42:44.700 --> 42:46.700]  They probably still can't do it
[42:46.700 --> 42:51.660]  All right, let me jump in here in the early minutes of the show with our first sponsor break and
[42:52.620 --> 42:55.260]  Remind everybody about our good friends at
[42:56.340 --> 42:59.780]  Connected data makers of file transporter
[42:59.780 --> 43:05.380]  All right, I use this analogy every time I talk about these guys. It's like your own private Dropbox
[43:06.060 --> 43:09.300]  You buy a device or you buy multiple devices
[43:09.620 --> 43:13.860]  They come to your house. They have hard drives in them or you hook hard drives up to them
[43:14.020 --> 43:18.060]  You put them on your local network. They're right there in your house in your office
[43:18.900 --> 43:24.540]  Wherever you want them to be but they're in your control and then you install the software on your Mac and you get a little
[43:24.540 --> 43:31.540]  Folder on your Mac like Dropbox and it syncs and where are those files in the folder? They are stored on your
[43:31.540 --> 43:38.460]  Transporter device and you can share between multiple people you can share between multiple devices multiple places
[43:38.460 --> 43:40.460]  You can hook more than one of them up
[43:40.740 --> 43:43.140]  But the basic idea is you have
[43:44.140 --> 43:46.640]  Sink between computers through the cloud
[43:47.100 --> 43:53.940]  But not stored on servers in the cloud. They're stored on devices that you own in control
[43:53.940 --> 43:58.620]  Maybe that's just for your own piece of mind because you're interested in the privacy implications of that
[43:59.180 --> 44:03.340]  Maybe it's because you have legal reasons that you actually can't store things on
[44:03.980 --> 44:05.980]  Devices that you don't control
[44:05.980 --> 44:10.220]  For HIPAA or things like that. They have an iOS app and this is new fairly new
[44:10.900 --> 44:15.560]  iOS app for the iPhone and iPads been updated that has a pretty cool feature where it does things like
[44:16.460 --> 44:20.460]  Upload all your photos and videos from your camera roll right to a special folder on
[44:20.460 --> 44:28.380]  Transporter for safekeeping. So you want to again if that's one of your things you really want to do is have a cloud-based
[44:29.660 --> 44:31.660]  Effectively cloud-based
[44:31.660 --> 44:35.260]  Backup automatically of your photos so that if something happens to your phone
[44:35.460 --> 44:38.020]  You've know you've got them automatically somewhere else
[44:38.620 --> 44:45.260]  But you don't want that somewhere else to be a server in California or who knows where
[44:45.260 --> 44:50.660]  Controlled by some big corporation that might have the NSA tapping it or whatever
[44:51.620 --> 44:53.660]  Transporter can do that for you. Really cool
[44:54.260 --> 44:57.380]  Great stuff if any of that appeals you go check them out
[44:57.740 --> 45:01.660]  Where you go is you go to www.filetransporter
[45:02.460 --> 45:04.460]  Store.com
[45:04.700 --> 45:09.340]  File transporter store.com and they have two deals for listeners
[45:09.540 --> 45:14.740]  You want to save 10% you can save up to 35 bucks on any of the regular transporter models
[45:14.740 --> 45:21.300]  By using the code TTS 10 the talk show 10 TTS 10
[45:21.660 --> 45:28.100]  They have 500 gigabyte one terabyte two pair of terabyte capacities save 10% big bucks or
[45:28.740 --> 45:33.220]  If you want to buy the little thing the little thing. It's like the puck is the transporter sink
[45:34.060 --> 45:38.460]  Same functionality, but what you do with this one instead of having a hard drive built into it
[45:38.460 --> 45:40.140]  You just hook any
[45:40.140 --> 45:45.380]  USB drive up to it. So if you already have a big USB drive or a couple of them sitting around you can
[45:45.620 --> 45:54.220]  Get a cheaper device smaller device and just hook your own drive up to it. You can save 20 bucks on one of those by using the code
[45:54.780 --> 45:55.820]  TTS
[45:55.820 --> 45:56.820]  20
[45:56.820 --> 45:58.820]  So TTS 20
[45:58.820 --> 46:07.220]  If you want to get the little sink TTS 10 if you want to get the the big regular transporter and anybody who uses either of those codes gets free shipping
[46:07.220 --> 46:10.860]  So go check them out of file transporter store dot com
[46:12.020 --> 46:17.540]  So what are we talking about we were talking about overcast before before the detour into old windows of Mac
[46:17.540 --> 46:21.740]  Yeah, it is a horrible days of the late 90s of using computers. God. I don't know how that happened
[46:21.740 --> 46:25.440]  That was terrible. All right, that would help the entire computer industry was in middle school
[46:25.940 --> 46:29.700]  So the middle school always sucks for everybody and it sucks for the computer industry and that was it
[46:30.020 --> 46:34.860]  That's a pretty good analogy. It really was and you're the worst of your personality comes out
[46:34.860 --> 46:36.860]  Yes
[46:36.860 --> 46:39.260]  Apple Apple went pie in the sky
[46:40.100 --> 46:44.060]  You know off-smoke and pot thinking they were gonna write a universal
[46:44.060 --> 46:47.380]  I just linked that up today the Talogen thing with IBM
[46:47.700 --> 46:55.100]  Like I Apple had had was writing multiple operating systems that never actually came to exist, you know, and there was Copeland
[46:56.980 --> 47:03.060]  And they did the whole Newton thing which wasn't a failure wasn't a bus, but obviously, you know wasn't a hit and therefore didn't
[47:03.060 --> 47:08.660]  You know, they took their eyes off the ball and left the thing that was actually keeping the company around
[47:09.140 --> 47:15.460]  They let it languish and then Microsoft man. It's just it really got they got bad
[47:15.460 --> 47:21.820]  But anyway, that's enough of that. I do think it's amusing that that like the biggest Apple news this week is probably the IBM thing and
[47:22.260 --> 47:29.740]  You choose to have me on I am probably the least qualified person in the world to comment on that in any fashion whatsoever
[47:29.740 --> 47:31.740]  Well, maybe next to me
[47:31.740 --> 47:34.500]  Let's get well, let's save it. Let's go. Let's do news at the end of the week
[47:34.500 --> 47:37.860]  That was keep going on overcast. I had a couple more programming questions
[47:37.860 --> 47:41.620]  So Brent wanted me to ask this when I told him you were gonna be on the show
[47:41.620 --> 47:47.100]  He wanted to know how hard the audio programming was because he said it sounds like it would be hard
[47:47.100 --> 47:50.540]  It sounds like it would be hard for him and knowing just some of the
[47:51.100 --> 47:52.700]  trickery that you're
[47:52.860 --> 47:54.860]  Implementing that it's even harder
[47:54.860 --> 48:01.580]  So that's that's a question how hard was audio programming and you had no background in audio programming before you got into this correct
[48:01.740 --> 48:03.740]  Well, that's not entirely true
[48:03.740 --> 48:07.340]  I I did a project in college where I was I was trying to make a
[48:08.060 --> 48:12.300]  Better lossless compression algorithm like flak and you know those those kind of lossless ones
[48:13.380 --> 48:17.100]  My project in college failed because the compression of that I wrote
[48:17.100 --> 48:24.820]  Took like 10 hours to compress one file and the resulting file was actually larger than the input file
[48:24.820 --> 48:30.180]  So it was not a success my idea for for how I could lossly compress them
[48:31.060 --> 48:33.060]  Was not a good idea turns out
[48:35.340 --> 48:39.580]  When I was in college and I was taking computer science courses. This is mid 90s
[48:41.260 --> 48:43.820]  That was you know 91 to 96
[48:43.820 --> 48:49.980]  Everybody was writing ray tracers ray tracers were like maybe they're still a common thing
[48:49.980 --> 48:56.260]  But man, and I I was nowhere near good enough to even try but I remember that there are some kids
[48:56.260 --> 49:00.540]  I knew who wrote one and they they were getting like like one frame a day
[49:00.540 --> 49:07.100]  I mean this just unbelievably slow and it just had no idea how to improve it and
[49:07.740 --> 49:09.740]  just like despondent
[49:09.740 --> 49:14.140]  It was like if we it's so slow that we can't even figure out why it's slow
[49:14.860 --> 49:17.100]  Well when I was writing this thing in 2003
[49:18.940 --> 49:24.940]  About the same number of people cared then as now about lossless audio encoding, which was about five and
[49:26.300 --> 49:31.740]  Yeah, I don't even use like I'm an audio file. I love high quality audio
[49:31.740 --> 49:35.420]  I have all sorts of ridiculous equipment to listen to high quality audio
[49:35.420 --> 49:41.180]  But I don't even use lossless audio files like even if that doesn't even make sense for me to have those giant
[49:41.180 --> 49:43.180]  files sitting there where I'm like a
[49:43.180 --> 49:49.260]  256 KMP3 well encoded sounds just as good to me. I can't have the difference. Yeah. Well, so it was it was a ridiculous background. Anyway
[49:50.780 --> 49:57.500]  Compression in general though is hard whether it's lossy or lossless because you're still focused on quality
[49:57.500 --> 50:02.780]  I mean, you know even if you're writing lossy compression, you know JPG or something like that
[50:02.780 --> 50:06.540]  You still you don't it's not it's not like you can disregard quality
[50:07.580 --> 50:12.700]  Right, and it's just mathematically. It's just it's really mind-bending. I mean to me at least
[50:13.180 --> 50:17.180]  Oh, yeah, I mean like the once you get past very elementary forms of compression
[50:17.660 --> 50:19.980]  The met it's all math and it's all like very
[50:20.700 --> 50:28.220]  Complicated difficult to understand math that is far beyond my comprehension most of the time or like I might understand the general concept
[50:28.220 --> 50:34.300]  But I certainly couldn't implement it or do it myself. Right. There's like a one one level deep of compression that anybody can
[50:34.300 --> 50:40.700]  Understand and it's like well if there's like what zip does. Yeah, if there's if there's 16 ones in a row you could just
[50:41.740 --> 50:47.740]  Write it down as six you know say that there's 16 ones and that takes fewer space than this 16 actual ones. Oh, yeah
[50:47.900 --> 50:49.900]  Well, guess what that doesn't get you very far
[50:50.460 --> 50:55.820]  Yeah, exactly that's that's called RLE and that was in Windows 3.1 and you know 15 20 years ago
[50:55.820 --> 51:01.340]  All right, if there's these very obvious repeated patterns that's how gift works. Actually. Yeah, but that's
[51:01.820 --> 51:08.620]  Gift as well. That's why gift has such wonderful compression that Twitter reimplemented is the movie files
[51:09.260 --> 51:12.780]  Right before letting exactly see the cat pictures I
[51:14.540 --> 51:21.340]  Saw people because that's I don't know if anybody doesn't know that the Twitter added quote-unquote added support for animated gifts
[51:21.340 --> 51:26.860]  A couple of weeks ago, and then somebody figured out that they're not actually animated gifts. They're sending out
[51:27.900 --> 51:31.940]  It's to 64 video and then I saw people who were upset about this
[51:31.940 --> 51:39.460]  And it's like what there's a reason they did it that the the age to 64 video files are like 10 times smaller than the gifts
[51:39.460 --> 51:42.660]  Oh, yeah, I mean like I wrote the gift processor and tumblr
[51:43.140 --> 51:46.260]  It's dealing with gifts is a ridiculous pain in the ass
[51:46.260 --> 51:53.580]  It's a terrible format. It for so many reasons and you know not least of which is that it isn't very efficient
[51:53.580 --> 51:54.900]  Compression
[51:54.900 --> 51:58.300]  But it for so many other reasons like it has the fixed
[51:59.100 --> 52:06.580]  256 color palette right which is really limiting. Oh, it's so crushing. It's so like that's and those colors
[52:06.580 --> 52:12.180]  I don't think those colors can change between frames of an of an animation picture about that. Oh, I'm almost certain that
[52:12.180 --> 52:17.260]  I don't think so. I don't think between frames. Yeah, so I'd I would be very surprised if that were true
[52:17.260 --> 52:21.220]  Yeah, I remember can't change the cut anyway. Yeah. It's that terrible format. It's terrible
[52:21.460 --> 52:28.380]  Well, you know right back to the 90s, you know, but there was that whole debate when when was it unisis started trying to enforce the patent on
[52:28.380 --> 52:29.980]  gif
[52:29.980 --> 52:31.980]  It was like they had it patented and
[52:32.740 --> 52:35.460]  Didn't do anything with it and while they didn't do anything with it
[52:35.620 --> 52:39.940]  You know the world the worldwide web grew up with tons and tons of gift files
[52:39.940 --> 52:44.660]  And then all of a sudden somebody unisis was like, well, we have a patent on that. Yeah, the submarine patent
[52:46.260 --> 52:52.980]  It's like the canonical example of of like a submarine patent. I think yeah, yeah, right
[52:52.980 --> 52:57.300]  Why you should never trust a company that says hey, just use our stuff. We're never gonna enforce it
[52:57.860 --> 53:04.000]  Yeah, but I remember that the subcurrent of the whole argument about what we should replace it with and what are we gonna do?
[53:04.000 --> 53:11.780]  blah, blah, blah, was we're doing all this to replace an awful truly awful file format and you can find people who complain about
[53:11.780 --> 53:14.980]  JPEG and that other there were other formats at the time for
[53:15.580 --> 53:22.380]  Photographs, you know, which you know the role that JPEG plays that that there were better alternatives and stuff like that
[53:22.380 --> 53:27.740]  They could have been done better in certain ways, but nobody really says JPEG is terrible. I mean JPEG is JPEG
[53:27.740 --> 53:32.540]  Right, you know pretty good served. Yeah, I mean JPEG like it and similar mp3
[53:32.540 --> 53:35.740]  mp3 is a very old format
[53:36.500 --> 53:44.700]  What people don't realize it stands for mp1 layer 3 right like mp1 files are I believe from the late 80s
[53:44.700 --> 53:50.820]  I mean it was a while it was a while before they were commonplace, but late 80s or early 90s is I believe is when mp1 became
[53:52.220 --> 53:57.900]  Extended and became playable and like that is when mp3 format like it's from that era
[53:57.900 --> 54:02.620]  Yeah, JPEG is not from that much later than that. It's I think it's also from the very early 90s
[54:02.620 --> 54:08.420]  Yeah, and and it was a while before it was you know fast enough that computers could display them very quickly
[54:08.700 --> 54:10.060]  But now
[54:10.060 --> 54:15.260]  Like and there are better formats like there was a format called JPEG 2000. Yeah, that no one ever uses
[54:15.260 --> 54:18.780]  And I believe there were some patent issues with it which is one of the reasons why but
[54:19.660 --> 54:26.260]  You know JPEG is good enough. Yeah, gift is a horrible just a horrible format. Oh, yeah, it was there were billions
[54:26.260 --> 54:30.020]  I forget there are the estimates for how many gift files that were on like the early internet
[54:30.020 --> 54:32.020]  But it was it quickly went from like
[54:32.340 --> 54:40.260]  Hundreds to billions one they're back now. I feel like this was like our bell bottoms moment. Yeah, we're like it like this this this thing that was like a weird fad
[54:41.220 --> 54:42.660]  15 years ago
[54:42.660 --> 54:44.260]  20 years ago like
[54:44.260 --> 54:51.340]  Mostly 15 years ago that thing that this thing was a weird fad back then now it's back and all of us who were around back then like why is this back?
[54:51.340 --> 54:59.500]  This is terrible. It's the fashion has come back around. These are definitely our bell bottoms. Yeah, but it's used in a way that
[55:00.300 --> 55:01.820]  That is
[55:01.820 --> 55:03.420]  There's a little bit of retro to it
[55:03.420 --> 55:11.340]  But then in the most ways there's not because the gifts that people post now these huge animated ones with lots of frames from video and TV and stuff like that
[55:11.820 --> 55:17.820]  Are so humongous that that in computers in the mid 90s and internet connections in the mid 90s
[55:17.820 --> 55:24.860]  Couldn't have even handled one of them. Oh, yeah, they're like three megs. I mean you got to figure like imagine the concept of a three-meg
[55:25.020 --> 55:26.460]  Give in
[55:26.460 --> 55:27.660]  1997
[55:27.660 --> 55:31.660]  Right, we used to try to make I forget the target for our web pages, but you know
[55:31.980 --> 55:33.980]  Just you know a lot of times you if part of your
[55:34.700 --> 55:41.140]  Project specs for building websites were what was the target size for the web page and it was always measured in kilobytes
[55:41.140 --> 55:45.260]  You know it was like how many seconds would it take to load over a 56k modem, right?
[55:45.260 --> 55:51.340]  It was you know somewhere between for most projects. I worked on it was usually like 10 20 kilobytes for the whole page all assets
[55:52.380 --> 55:56.780]  Right cuz old cuz that would take a few seconds to load take forever to load. It is horrible
[55:58.780 --> 56:05.540]  So it answers your actual question, but if a three megabyte gift mile in the middle of the page would be terrible
[56:05.540 --> 56:10.340]  Right, I mean if it could even load without something running out of memory and crashing while decoding it
[56:10.340 --> 56:14.180]  Which is unlikely but if it could even load it would have taken 45 minutes to load
[56:14.180 --> 56:19.020]  All right, I also think if I'm remembering correctly. I'd then this hike here
[56:19.020 --> 56:22.180]  I could be I could be way off my rocker, but I seem to recall
[56:22.980 --> 56:24.660]  that like
[56:24.660 --> 56:26.060]  early
[56:26.060 --> 56:32.580]  Hosting accounts like if you were hosting a website somewhere like storage and bandwidth were measured in megabytes
[56:33.380 --> 56:41.460]  Like I don't know how many megabytes, but like you know you you just you couldn't serve up a couple hundred copies of a three megabyte file
[56:41.460 --> 56:43.460]  You just couldn't definitely not
[56:44.460 --> 56:46.700]  God and now people just crap them out
[56:47.860 --> 56:51.180]  Because now you can host them for free and I'm million different services that I want your privacy
[56:52.020 --> 56:58.940]  All right back to audio program. So you did have some experience in college. Yeah, and I've I've like to wait with it here and there
[56:58.940 --> 57:02.500]  It was a complete failure. Yeah. Yeah, my college experience was awful
[57:04.340 --> 57:09.460]  But you know, I got the basic concept of you know the samples and the frames and the formats and everything so you know
[57:09.460 --> 57:12.060]  And I've I've always been an audio nerd
[57:12.660 --> 57:17.380]  So I was though. I've always been familiar with you know editing audio in in basic forms
[57:18.180 --> 57:24.780]  Playing with it, you know, I've I've music and and talk radio have always been very important to me
[57:24.780 --> 57:27.860]  And so I've always kind of been in this anyway, so
[57:28.820 --> 57:30.820]  the audio programming in overcast
[57:30.820 --> 57:38.820]  Was by far my favorite part and it was ridiculously hard, but it was that it was the kind of good
[57:39.140 --> 57:45.260]  Hard for a programmer which is like it was it's very intellectually stimulating and so it was it's exactly what I love to do
[57:45.260 --> 57:52.180]  Which is working at a very low-level C code doing stuff that you don't think will be possible to do quickly and
[57:53.060 --> 57:58.340]  You know like it's questionable whether it will run on an iPhone at reasonable speed and that reasonable battery drain
[57:58.340 --> 58:04.140]  You know doing very low-level stuff like that using things that you know try to make even more efficient
[58:04.140 --> 58:08.300]  Try to take an even better trick to get this way, you know throw in some of the vector algorithms and stuff like that
[58:09.820 --> 58:12.620]  That it was it was a very very fun
[58:13.060 --> 58:17.780]  hard if that makes sense and it didn't take that much time
[58:17.780 --> 58:21.700]  You know relative to the entire rest of the app the audio engine
[58:22.740 --> 58:26.220]  It's it's actually easier in in many ways because
[58:26.220 --> 58:32.140]  It is self-contained and and what it's doing. It's a relatively simple task. It's easy to test
[58:32.140 --> 58:34.140]  It's easy to benchmark. It's easy to
[58:35.060 --> 58:37.060]  Find bugs and fix them
[58:37.660 --> 58:42.860]  Whereas if you compare if you compare that to like UI programming or sync logic to the server
[58:43.300 --> 58:45.940]  Like those things are much higher level code
[58:46.460 --> 58:49.260]  There's much more code to do that sort of stuff
[58:49.820 --> 58:53.900]  You know relative in total for the whole app and it's much harder to test
[58:53.900 --> 58:58.540]  There's always all these weird edge cases. You know the audio code really was it isn't that way
[58:58.540 --> 59:03.860]  It you have a stream of numbers coming in and you gotta put out a stream of numbers and there's some buffering issue
[59:03.860 --> 59:08.940]  You got to take care of and some some performance issues. You got to take care of and and you know some edge cases here there
[59:08.940 --> 59:13.540]  But it's nowhere near the level of of like possibility
[59:13.940 --> 59:16.660]  Complexity that programming and interface is
[59:17.340 --> 59:19.540]  Hmm, I think it helps that you're an audio file
[59:19.540 --> 59:26.020]  I really in fact I don't know that it would have worked that way otherwise because I'm not I'm a complete anti audio file
[59:26.020 --> 59:28.860]  I just want to hit yeah, I don't know. I'm well
[59:28.860 --> 59:31.020]  I shouldn't say anti because I do care about quality
[59:31.020 --> 59:39.100]  But my threshold for what sounds good seems a lot lower than then people who you know like you who are really into headphones and stuff like that
[59:39.100 --> 59:43.940]  Like like my you know line up 20 pairs of headphones and I'm gonna say
[59:44.300 --> 59:48.420]  There's a decent chance. I might find that they all sound pretty good if you know
[59:48.420 --> 59:51.620]  They're all costs. I don't know 60, 70, 80 bucks or above
[59:52.500 --> 59:54.500]  And I would have a harder time
[59:55.020 --> 59:59.060]  Talking about the differences if I did hear a difference between the two I'd have a harder time
[59:59.540 --> 1:00:05.220]  Describing right right and I think that helps because I would think most people and I wondered you know
[1:00:05.220 --> 1:00:09.820]  Maybe you know this maybe you can even tell like if I were gonna write a podcast app
[1:00:10.220 --> 1:00:14.460]  Or I were gonna be part of a team knows writing one my idea would be well
[1:00:14.460 --> 1:00:19.060]  I would just let the system I'd let iOS handle all the audio playback we get that there's a part
[1:00:19.060 --> 1:00:21.060]  We get for free we give the system
[1:00:21.780 --> 1:00:29.260]  An audio format that core audio knows how to play and then it'll play it and we don't have to worry about that and then start from there
[1:00:30.260 --> 1:00:36.860]  And I think that you know clearly that would rule out a whole bunch of the features that are in overcast
[1:00:37.500 --> 1:00:42.060]  Yeah, I mean the biggest one like you can do voice boost
[1:00:42.060 --> 1:00:47.420]  Using the simpler API's it is not you can't do it very well, but you can do it
[1:00:47.780 --> 1:00:50.860]  There's just a few little downsides, but most people wouldn't notice it'd be fine
[1:00:52.100 --> 1:01:01.660]  You definitely cannot do smart speed in any reasonable approachable way and so I had to do this if I wanted smart speed and
[1:01:02.900 --> 1:01:08.060]  It was an important enough feature for me that I said it was worth it, you know and and the reality is as
[1:01:08.060 --> 1:01:15.500]  As I said like the audio engine was very very hard for about you know a few weeks or a month maybe and then it was done
[1:01:15.500 --> 1:01:18.460]  And then the rest of the app was was the rest of the development time
[1:01:18.460 --> 1:01:21.620]  I haven't touched the audio processing code in months
[1:01:22.220 --> 1:01:24.700]  Because it's just it's fun. Okay, I made it over the course
[1:01:24.700 --> 1:01:29.940]  You know, I'd like I'd go in every once in a while and make a little tweak to like how something was dealt with or you know
[1:01:29.940 --> 1:01:32.540]  The levels or the EQ stuff like that, but
[1:01:32.540 --> 1:01:37.940]  For the most part it has barely changed in almost two years since I wrote it
[1:01:39.620 --> 1:01:42.940]  So those are the two like magic here just make this better
[1:01:43.700 --> 1:01:45.700]  features in
[1:01:45.700 --> 1:01:54.300]  In overcast smart speed and voice boost and I think of them as they're the audio equivalent of like that magic one thing in the photos app
[1:01:54.540 --> 1:02:01.620]  Exactly right and you say just make it better and a lot of times for me that button makes the photo better and in every once in a while
[1:02:01.620 --> 1:02:03.980]  It doesn't and then you can tap it again and it goes away
[1:02:03.980 --> 1:02:09.740]  And it's just like that with podcasts where you can say turn on smart speed and if you think this is better
[1:02:09.740 --> 1:02:13.260]  This is an easier way to listen to the show keep it on if not turn it off
[1:02:14.220 --> 1:02:19.060]  Exactly and and there are some shows where one or both those options will actually make it sound worse
[1:02:19.060 --> 1:02:22.060]  And that's why those buttons for those instead of just being on all the time
[1:02:22.860 --> 1:02:25.460]  But I found in the majority of shows I listened to
[1:02:26.700 --> 1:02:29.340]  The combination of both of them usually make it sound better
[1:02:29.340 --> 1:02:33.660]  What was the deal? I remember this there was a really interesting thread on the beta
[1:02:34.260 --> 1:02:37.640]  Glassport about the names of those features and
[1:02:38.340 --> 1:02:42.220]  Early on. I hope I'm not talking not a good behind the scenes
[1:02:42.220 --> 1:02:47.860]  But the voice voice boost had a different name, right? I think it just a boost early on
[1:02:48.460 --> 1:02:53.500]  Voice boost was not on or off. There were there were three modes to it
[1:02:53.740 --> 1:02:56.900]  There was their four modes. There was off
[1:02:56.900 --> 1:03:02.900]  Where it didn't process anything there was enhance and then boost and then also reduce
[1:03:03.300 --> 1:03:09.060]  Yeah, it was was a mode that would actually cut off the spectrum on the extreme highs and extreme lows
[1:03:09.060 --> 1:03:13.620]  So it would like if somebody sometimes you have a podcast where it's like way too much base
[1:03:13.620 --> 1:03:20.300]  And if you play it like in a bathroom or something like it it sounds really echo-y and horrible and it's it's hard to listen to
[1:03:20.300 --> 1:03:28.500]  Some of them also will leave in like very very high-pitched wines as an artifact of some part of their processing
[1:03:28.500 --> 1:03:33.260]  And I never quite figured out what causes that but some podcast will have that occasionally and this has been true for years
[1:03:33.260 --> 1:03:34.660]  way before ever cast
[1:03:34.660 --> 1:03:37.740]  And so reduce mode would cut those ends off and
[1:03:38.540 --> 1:03:44.620]  Then enhance and boost both did the same thing just boost did it more severely
[1:03:45.340 --> 1:03:48.060]  Boost was like a larger boost basically
[1:03:48.060 --> 1:03:52.180]  and so I had this the slider reduce off enhance boost and
[1:03:53.580 --> 1:03:56.180]  That was true for about half of the beta really
[1:03:56.740 --> 1:04:01.220]  Yeah, I was always confused as hell by the whole thing. Yeah, I kind of just wanted
[1:04:01.220 --> 1:04:05.940]  I really just wanted Marco just make it sound better for me, right?
[1:04:05.940 --> 1:04:10.540]  And and that was that was a common request actually and and what I what I eventually found
[1:04:10.780 --> 1:04:15.700]  What I realized is that even myself I was just leaving everything on boost all the time
[1:04:15.700 --> 1:04:20.380]  Like I wasn't using any of the other settings. I thought I would when I made them and then it turns out
[1:04:20.380 --> 1:04:26.460]  I was not using them at all. Yeah, and so that's when I reread it on that screen to just be just a button is this on or off
[1:04:27.500 --> 1:04:34.660]  Yeah, and it sounds like it's also a real interesting difference between where you listen to podcasts and it's like
[1:04:34.660 --> 1:04:39.340]  It seems like this feature the voice boost in particular really comes in handy to people who listen in their car
[1:04:40.340 --> 1:04:43.700]  Yeah, definitely that's I mean, that's why I made it because I listen all the time in my car
[1:04:43.700 --> 1:04:50.620]  I I I got a new car a couple years ago and it came with a serious radio and probably like you know a six-month trial subscription
[1:04:50.620 --> 1:04:54.020]  I never activated it. I'm only listening to podcasts now
[1:04:54.020 --> 1:05:01.060]  I I used to listen to satellite radio before that I would listen to like mp3s and CDs and everything now in my car
[1:05:01.060 --> 1:05:07.620]  I'm always listening to either either nothing like if I'm talking a tip or if I'm running alone usually it's always podcasts
[1:05:07.780 --> 1:05:12.020]  That's it. Yeah, and yeah voice boost makes a massive difference in the car
[1:05:12.020 --> 1:05:15.060]  All right, because noisy environment and you yeah, it's a noisy environment
[1:05:15.060 --> 1:05:18.980]  So the baseline for where you need the quietest voice on the show to be
[1:05:20.100 --> 1:05:28.660]  Audible is potentially dangerously high for like a burst of laughter or somebody else who's who was recorded at a higher level
[1:05:28.820 --> 1:05:36.500]  Right, you know if you have somebody who's very you know polite and soft-spoken like Brent, you know, I used his old show as an example the
[1:05:36.500 --> 1:05:44.100]  I'm what was that show called with the calendar guy. Oh the Simmons the Simmons brothers. Yeah, I don't because yeah
[1:05:44.740 --> 1:05:47.860]  Yeah, I use that show as one. Oh, that's good because Michael Simmons
[1:05:49.060 --> 1:05:53.300]  So loud he was like a loud boisterous voice and Brent would was soft-spoken
[1:05:53.300 --> 1:05:55.940]  Yeah, and they didn't level it very well at first because they you know
[1:05:55.940 --> 1:05:57.700]  They were when they first started the show they were you know
[1:05:57.700 --> 1:06:00.820]  They were in the experience producing podcasts and they got better at it afterwards
[1:06:00.820 --> 1:06:06.460]  But I use I use the earlier episodes as a test for this feature because it was the perfect case
[1:06:06.460 --> 1:06:12.860]  Where I wanted to hear what Brent was saying without having my ears blown out when Michael would talk and so it was
[1:06:13.180 --> 1:06:16.420]  It was exactly the situation where voice boost is necessary
[1:06:16.420 --> 1:06:22.260]  So a voice boost is it it's combination of an EQ and a compressor and the compressor
[1:06:22.660 --> 1:06:28.380]  And it looks at the files on a couple other ways, but for the most part it's a compressor that that's that most of what you're hearing is the compressor
[1:06:28.380 --> 1:06:35.980]  and and and that was exactly exactly what it's for which is make Brent loud enough so I can hear him in the car
[1:06:36.380 --> 1:06:40.780]  Without blowing up my ears when anyone else talks. Yeah, and there's like an old record producer
[1:06:41.340 --> 1:06:46.780]  Atage that you know you don't you don't optimize a music album for
[1:06:48.220 --> 1:06:54.620]  High quality studio headphones you optimize it for the actual way that people in real world are going to listen to this music
[1:06:54.620 --> 1:06:57.260]  Which might be you know 10 20 years ago
[1:06:57.260 --> 1:07:00.380]  You know a piece of crap portable radio
[1:07:00.380 --> 1:07:05.260]  You want to make sure it sounds good on that because that's where you know that if it doesn't sound good on that
[1:07:05.260 --> 1:07:08.060]  You're never gonna have a hit song no matter how good it sounds on your you know
[1:07:08.620 --> 1:07:10.620]  $1,000 studio headphones
[1:07:10.620 --> 1:07:16.500]  Exactly. Yeah, got it optimized for the real world. Yeah, and that's true. It's true web design app design. It's true everything
[1:07:17.900 --> 1:07:23.660]  One more question I had I'm surprised Brent is you ask is I was feet is feet parsing a nightmare
[1:07:23.660 --> 1:07:28.460]  for podcasts is it just like as bad as RSS because
[1:07:29.500 --> 1:07:32.220]  You know first of all podcasts are just simpler than
[1:07:32.860 --> 1:07:37.980]  the entirety of RSS feeds because you know the entirety of RSS feeds first of all includes Adam and
[1:07:38.620 --> 1:07:40.620]  40 from versions of RSS and
[1:07:41.260 --> 1:07:45.180]  And the the use cases for RSS feeds are very varied
[1:07:46.060 --> 1:07:50.700]  There's all sorts of things like it isn't just a site like in gadget posting news headlines
[1:07:50.700 --> 1:07:55.660]  There's all sorts of things publish RSS feeds that that any feed parser has to handle
[1:07:56.860 --> 1:08:04.140]  Podcasts have two things going for them. Not only are it is the scope of what they cover much smaller than that because for the most part
[1:08:04.700 --> 1:08:07.500]  It's audio shows that are produced, you know
[1:08:07.980 --> 1:08:13.180]  Once a day once a week maybe the most extreme ones might be published once an hour if it's like a dump from a radio station
[1:08:13.740 --> 1:08:20.060]  But there's you know not much more than that and you know usually it's pretty you know pretty well formed for the most part
[1:08:20.060 --> 1:08:24.060]  And the and the second big thing is that for all of the mediums history
[1:08:24.540 --> 1:08:27.100]  iTunes has been the dominant player and
[1:08:27.660 --> 1:08:30.140]  Historically it it iTunes is less picky now
[1:08:30.460 --> 1:08:32.460]  But before in previous years
[1:08:32.460 --> 1:08:38.140]  iTunes used to be very picky about what kind of feeds it would accept if your feed was malformed at all
[1:08:38.700 --> 1:08:45.180]  iTunes wouldn't take it and so it kind of enforced a level of consistency and quality even even a format
[1:08:45.180 --> 1:08:51.980]  iTunes for the for the longest time only supported RSS it didn't even support Adam and it still doesn't support it that well
[1:08:52.540 --> 1:08:53.500]  Right, yeah exactly
[1:08:53.500 --> 1:08:59.020]  It does support Adam, but not well because I looked into that when I had to take over the feed for this show and
[1:09:00.140 --> 1:09:03.500]  My back-end publishing stuff is all set up for Adam
[1:09:04.620 --> 1:09:11.660]  Or at least it would work better with Adam and theory and the bottom line was you could but you don't want to if you really want
[1:09:11.660 --> 1:09:15.820]  You really want your podcast to be our RSS?
[1:09:15.820 --> 1:09:23.500]  Actual RSS not the RSS as a catch all term that includes Adam which is amazing and Adam in I know this is like
[1:09:23.980 --> 1:09:29.820]  This is like a holy war of 2003. Yeah, but I really don't like Adam as a format
[1:09:31.340 --> 1:09:39.100]  You know RSS was clearly designed to be pragmatic and Adam was designed to be the standard that ends all standards
[1:09:39.100 --> 1:09:45.980]  It kind of can reproduce anything. Yeah, it shows. You know it shows in the complexity of these two formats and and Adam has a lot of
[1:09:46.620 --> 1:09:48.540]  ambiguity in like okay, well
[1:09:48.540 --> 1:09:53.100]  There's 17 different ways to represent the date and you if you need to support all these because some people might use this one
[1:09:53.100 --> 1:09:59.260]  And then what the heck is an author does everything have an author how is this author relevant to this other author and there's like
[1:09:59.900 --> 1:10:02.940]  Everything in Adam is well it depends
[1:10:03.420 --> 1:10:06.940]  You know and there's like 17 different ways to do it and in RSS
[1:10:06.940 --> 1:10:13.020]  You know, it isn't a perfect format. There are some ambiguities built in the into the format that are kind of annoying like the lack of required
[1:10:13.020 --> 1:10:16.540]  GUID's for instance, but for the most part
[1:10:17.900 --> 1:10:22.140]  RSS, you know as its name states is way simpler and
[1:10:22.540 --> 1:10:27.580]  Just to deal with to publish and to consume it is so much simpler because the format
[1:10:27.580 --> 1:10:34.540]  Just can't represent all the little tiny nuances that Adam can and Adam sees that as a flaw. I see that as a feature
[1:10:34.540 --> 1:10:38.940]  Yeah, I totally agree in hindsight, and you know who knows maybe someday
[1:10:38.940 --> 1:10:42.220]  I'll just change everything at during Fireball to go RSS instead of Adam
[1:10:42.220 --> 1:10:48.380]  But for some reason I picked the wrong side back then and I somehow convinced myself that I don't know
[1:10:48.380 --> 1:10:50.380]  I think I kind of bought into the
[1:10:53.820 --> 1:10:58.060]  The the that does sound good arguments behind the Adam people
[1:10:58.060 --> 1:11:00.780]  I mean, I never got involved in it and wasn't really active
[1:11:00.780 --> 1:11:07.260]  But you know Rick reading Mark Pilgrim's blog back then and a couple other people who were involved it all made a lot of sense to me
[1:11:07.260 --> 1:11:13.100]  And there were certain aspects of it that if you if you rendered a very simple feed in Adam
[1:11:13.100 --> 1:11:16.140]  It looked better to me than RSS and still does in a way
[1:11:16.620 --> 1:11:21.020]  Like I'm not thinking about it from the perspective of someone writing a parser and you have to handle everything
[1:11:21.020 --> 1:11:28.140]  I was thinking of it in terms of what would make my the daring fireball feed look better if you just looked at it
[1:11:28.140 --> 1:11:34.140]  And I still think Adam is better in that regard, but that's a stupid thing to make the judgment on
[1:11:34.620 --> 1:11:41.660]  I think I think the smarter way to look at it is just to say RSS is super pragmatic and it is
[1:11:42.140 --> 1:11:47.820]  Designed from the get-go for doing exactly and only what I was doing which is here's a bunch of articles
[1:11:48.620 --> 1:11:50.300]  Yeah, we're as opposed to like here
[1:11:50.300 --> 1:11:55.260]  We have to we have to design an overarching standard that will encompass every possible thing everyone will ever want to do again
[1:11:55.260 --> 1:12:01.820]  Yeah, you know, it's it's all and and Adam was also, you know a lot more strict with certain things and it's almost there's almost a parallel between
[1:12:02.380 --> 1:12:08.140]  XHTML being Adam. Yeah, I think it's ML five or even old HTML being RSS
[1:12:08.700 --> 1:12:13.820]  Where it's just like you know, they it was more structured more defined but way more complex
[1:12:14.060 --> 1:12:16.060]  And it sounded good in theory
[1:12:16.460 --> 1:12:21.660]  Then in practice. It just doesn't really work that well and it's it's actually more complicated to deal with in practice
[1:12:21.660 --> 1:12:27.580]  Yeah, and RSS thing went by really quickly and just a handful of years whereas the HTML thing played out over
[1:12:28.220 --> 1:12:31.580]  Almost 20 years, but I think it is pretty
[1:12:31.980 --> 1:12:35.420]  I think that's a pretty decent high-level analogy and in that analogy
[1:12:35.420 --> 1:12:37.820]  I think RSS 2.0 is HTML five
[1:12:38.460 --> 1:12:41.740]  Which is yeah, yeah, yeah, the early the RSS and it had weird numbers
[1:12:41.740 --> 1:12:46.940]  It was like point nine and point nine one and point nine two and the weird thing was that like
[1:12:46.940 --> 1:12:53.300]  point nine one was from Netscape and Dave Weiner had nothing to do with it and point nine two went back to Dave
[1:12:53.300 --> 1:12:57.900]  Weiner and ignored everything that was in point nine one. It was really a sequel to point nine
[1:12:57.900 --> 1:13:03.940]  Oh, I know I'm getting these version numbers wrong, but it doesn't matter that it doesn't matter that I'm getting the exact version numbers wrong
[1:13:03.940 --> 1:13:07.740]  It's it's yeah, Brent was literally a ground zero for all of that
[1:13:07.740 --> 1:13:11.260]  Yeah, he was like writing all the parsers and generators for all of these things
[1:13:11.820 --> 1:13:15.500]  And to be clear when I'm talking with RSS I'm talking with RSS two the earlier ones
[1:13:15.500 --> 1:13:20.060]  Yeah, the RDF based ones that disaster, but we went but did that was the battle though, right?
[1:13:20.060 --> 1:13:25.500]  That was you know, and that's like were they xx html never really was pitted against HTML 4
[1:13:25.500 --> 1:13:28.220]  It was really pitted against a state, you know HTML 5
[1:13:28.700 --> 1:13:31.740]  I mean even though the time, you know, they weren't at the same time effectively
[1:13:31.900 --> 1:13:39.660]  It was well the world's gonna move off HTML 4 eventually and you know the standards people you know really thought it was
[1:13:39.660 --> 1:13:45.260]  Uh, I'm gonna be x states email because my god
[1:13:45.260 --> 1:13:50.540]  It's gonna be great. It'll enforce that all of your web pages are XML compliant because if it's not it won't render
[1:13:51.020 --> 1:13:53.820]  Right. Yeah, everything everything was like structure
[1:13:54.380 --> 1:13:58.620]  This is a battle that you know computing has gone back and forth in this in cycles for decades
[1:13:59.100 --> 1:14:06.860]  It was a battle for like structure and definitions and schemas and well-defined everything and extremely unforgiving
[1:14:06.860 --> 1:14:13.260]  implementations versus you know forgiving flexible just kind of you know spew something out and we'll try to figure out what it is
[1:14:13.660 --> 1:14:18.780]  And the same the same thing is happening now with like objective c versus swift even
[1:14:18.780 --> 1:14:23.980]  I mean it like it's this that we keep having the same battle over and over again where you know somebody will want you know
[1:14:23.980 --> 1:14:28.860]  The there will be some kind of you know class of problems that
[1:14:29.340 --> 1:14:35.100]  Academic people will try to well think needs to be solved and the way to solve it is to require
[1:14:35.100 --> 1:14:39.260]  Standards so everything can be strictly typed and and and you know
[1:14:39.580 --> 1:14:42.940]  We can validate everything and everything has to be defined in a file
[1:14:43.180 --> 1:14:48.060]  And we're gonna write everything in Java with 10 met with 10 class deep hierarchies of every model
[1:14:48.060 --> 1:14:49.820]  This isn't this isn't just a person
[1:14:49.820 --> 1:14:56.220]  We need to have a person factory constructor to construct the factory to build people and like all this like this levels and levels of
[1:14:56.460 --> 1:14:58.460]  complexity and structure
[1:14:58.940 --> 1:15:02.380]  To combat the free form wild west of dirty data
[1:15:02.380 --> 1:15:06.700]  You know, and then the dirty data people come in and do everything faster and everything just works anyway and then
[1:15:07.340 --> 1:15:09.340]  The cycle repeats again. It's uh
[1:15:09.900 --> 1:15:13.500]  I'm I think we're gonna always see this cycle just go back and forth
[1:15:14.060 --> 1:15:17.820]  I mean no, I was not going to get into this and this could be this could absolutely
[1:15:18.620 --> 1:15:20.620]  sink the entire
[1:15:21.020 --> 1:15:26.620]  You might as well now. I mean have you seen this thing where there's this group that wants to turn mark down into an i
[1:15:27.020 --> 1:15:28.220]  ETF standard
[1:15:28.620 --> 1:15:30.620]  No, let me guess Jeff atwood
[1:15:30.620 --> 1:15:37.820]  I I don't even know. You know, it it broke last weekend. I was out of town with with Amy and
[1:15:38.460 --> 1:15:41.740]  It wasn't paying attention and I've been busy this week on other stuff
[1:15:41.740 --> 1:15:47.100]  I haven't even paid attention to it, but I don't know if it's I don't know if it's associated with that would screw say it or not
[1:15:47.820 --> 1:15:49.820]  um
[1:15:49.820 --> 1:15:56.620]  And there's talk from some people and the funny thing is they're doing it on a mailing list that I still host and I haven't participated on in
[1:15:56.620 --> 1:16:02.780]  Years and I don't know why I haven't pulled the plug on the damn mailing list, but I still host the mark down discuss mailing list
[1:16:02.780 --> 1:16:06.220]  And there's people saying that they should just take the name mark down from me
[1:16:07.020 --> 1:16:07.980]  um
[1:16:07.980 --> 1:16:16.780]  Because I've been such a lousy steward of it of it and at whatever meanwhile, you know, there's the the web pages on my site for mark down with
[1:16:17.020 --> 1:16:19.020]  Describing this in text and everything
[1:16:19.020 --> 1:16:21.420]  Uh are more popular every single day
[1:16:22.300 --> 1:16:26.220]  It's more popular the mark that I could actually I've thought about selling a sponsorship
[1:16:26.220 --> 1:16:28.220]  Just for mark down alone
[1:16:28.220 --> 1:16:36.060]  Because it's more popular the mark down pages on Daring Fireball get more traffic than Daring Fireball did as a whole when I went professional with Daring Fireball
[1:16:38.060 --> 1:16:42.940]  And you could even you could get like you know web development kind of advertisements for that too like it's a different market
[1:16:42.940 --> 1:16:46.940]  Right, that's what I've that's exactly why I thought that I could have a job board just on that page
[1:16:47.580 --> 1:16:52.140]  Although I do actually think a lot of the traffic is not coming from web developers
[1:16:52.140 --> 1:16:58.460]  It's coming from people who are using a new a site that is switched to mark down as the format
[1:16:59.260 --> 1:17:01.820]  Um, you know for that makes sense or whatever
[1:17:02.140 --> 1:17:04.780]  But anyway long story. I mean I could go on forever about this
[1:17:04.780 --> 1:17:10.620]  But to me mark downs not successful despite not being a standard
[1:17:11.820 --> 1:17:16.460]  And and and etc and etc and all that would entail but it because of that
[1:17:17.100 --> 1:17:21.900]  Now it's possible that it would be better off if there were some kind of spec that could you know
[1:17:21.900 --> 1:17:25.740]  If there were a spec that implementers could implement for some things
[1:17:28.060 --> 1:17:30.060]  And you know, maybe I'll do I there's
[1:17:31.020 --> 1:17:32.220]  I don't want to get too deep in this
[1:17:32.220 --> 1:17:37.100]  But there's some ideas and some work that some people have done that's really interesting in that regard because
[1:17:37.420 --> 1:17:41.900]  99.999% of people wouldn't have to worry about it and it wouldn't change things
[1:17:42.380 --> 1:17:49.420]  Um, but some of the things that people see as a problem like the fact that different mark down implementations are slightly different
[1:17:49.420 --> 1:17:53.980]  It's not a problem. It's actually, you know, that's actually a good thing because then github
[1:17:54.540 --> 1:17:57.340]  Which has a to my opinion a great flavor of mark down
[1:17:57.580 --> 1:18:00.140]  They even call it and they have a great name for it perfect name
[1:18:00.140 --> 1:18:05.020]  It's called github flavored mark down and it is exactly suited for github users
[1:18:05.020 --> 1:18:07.500]  And it does code a little differently because
[1:18:08.620 --> 1:18:12.540]  No shit github users are writing a lot of you know code blocks right
[1:18:13.020 --> 1:18:15.020]  um
[1:18:15.020 --> 1:18:19.580]  And it would not and and almost none of their changes would make sense for mark down everywhere
[1:18:20.700 --> 1:18:22.700]  So, you know, it's great
[1:18:23.740 --> 1:18:28.620]  I don't know people see the world is broken regarding mark down because there's not one true mark down
[1:18:29.260 --> 1:18:32.620]  Uh, meanwhile in the real world everybody's happy writing mark down
[1:18:33.580 --> 1:18:39.100]  Yeah, I think you're right. It doesn't it doesn't seem like it's a problem that needs to really be solved
[1:18:39.100 --> 1:18:43.180]  Uh, exactly and you know, it's I think I think there's this temp
[1:18:43.180 --> 1:18:46.460]  There's a tendency for programmers to want to
[1:18:47.500 --> 1:18:52.940]  Clean up standards and and and formalize things like that and in many cases that is warranted
[1:18:53.660 --> 1:18:58.700]  Um, but I think saying that everything has to be a standard is like saying open always wins
[1:18:58.700 --> 1:19:01.900]  Exactly like, you know, that that is true sometimes
[1:19:02.220 --> 1:19:04.860]  But it is not a generalization that holds all the time
[1:19:05.820 --> 1:19:06.300]  And
[1:19:07.340 --> 1:19:10.060]  I don't know, I mean, maybe there are things that should be standardized
[1:19:10.060 --> 1:19:14.620]  But it seems like mark down has gotten along just fine without that and it's moving along funny
[1:19:14.620 --> 1:19:18.220]  And you're right that, you know, different implementations will have different needs
[1:19:18.780 --> 1:19:25.900]  And it is it is not wise to try to cram all these specialty needs into one standard than everybody must
[1:19:26.380 --> 1:19:31.100]  Follow and then and then everything gets version and you have to be like, oh, well, does this support mark down 2.0 or not?
[1:19:31.100 --> 1:19:33.020]  And it's it's kind of a mess
[1:19:33.020 --> 1:19:35.020]  I don't know it's a hard problem to solve
[1:19:35.260 --> 1:19:38.460]  But I wouldn't assume that a standard's body is
[1:19:38.460 --> 1:19:45.660]  Necessarily the right solution to this problem. I would almost certainly say it is absolutely not
[1:19:46.140 --> 1:19:49.660]  Well, of course you would say that because they're basically trying to fire you right
[1:19:50.620 --> 1:19:52.620]  But I don't know it
[1:19:52.860 --> 1:19:54.940]  I think that the success of mark down
[1:19:55.660 --> 1:19:59.100]  Despite not having a standard's body behind it all this time
[1:19:59.900 --> 1:20:05.260]  Is the biggest evidence why it probably doesn't need one right exactly and you know part of what it meant?
[1:20:05.260 --> 1:20:09.020]  Let's get by without a spec and you know, and I you know, I like
[1:20:10.140 --> 1:20:17.020]  Be better in some ways there are there's things that could be clarified and there's things that make mark down very hard for example to write a syntax coloring
[1:20:17.980 --> 1:20:25.420]  Description for because of ambiguities. There's things the the assumption with mark down the thing that that the reason why it doesn't have a spec
[1:20:25.420 --> 1:20:33.500]  And why I think it probably shouldn't is the general assumption is that whoever is writing it knows what they're doing and isn't going to put input random gibberish
[1:20:33.500 --> 1:20:37.500]  And there's all sorts of the problems that people are talking about is well, what if you
[1:20:38.140 --> 1:20:43.180]  Put seven asterisks in a row. What is that generate? Well, don't do that. That's my answer
[1:20:43.180 --> 1:20:46.540]  I don't know what it generates is a generate a bunch of empty
[1:20:46.860 --> 1:20:52.300]  Em tags or strong tags. I don't know. It just seems like just why would you do that?
[1:20:53.980 --> 1:20:58.780]  You know check what it looks like before you publish it and if you see oh, I forgot that if I put a bunch of
[1:20:58.780 --> 1:21:04.140]  asterisks there that means something at mark down I should backslash escape them just you know
[1:21:04.700 --> 1:21:06.700]  Take a look at it
[1:21:06.700 --> 1:21:11.660]  It could be better. I'm not trying to brush aside all criticism of it and say that there's nothing
[1:21:11.660 --> 1:21:17.420]  I could do better. There's I maybe I should wait take a couple of weeks and wait back in and clean up some things
[1:21:17.740 --> 1:21:21.340]  But I think what mark down needs for me would be like a version
[1:21:21.740 --> 1:21:24.860]  I don't even know what the official version, but like if it's at 1.0
[1:21:24.860 --> 1:21:28.220]  one I should do like a 1.0 two
[1:21:29.260 --> 1:21:35.500]  Or at most like a 1.1. Yeah, maybe a 1.1. There's no need for a mark down to point out
[1:21:36.460 --> 1:21:39.820]  And there's no need for a standard or respect, but people get really worked up about it
[1:21:40.220 --> 1:21:44.460]  What if they just make their own thing and give it another name and see if it catches on exactly?
[1:21:44.460 --> 1:21:49.420]  That's I've said that to that's like I probably should set up a text expander snippet for that
[1:21:50.220 --> 1:21:52.220]  Make up your own thing and see if it catches on
[1:21:52.220 --> 1:21:55.100]  Yeah, cuz it might and then then find a problem solved
[1:21:55.100 --> 1:21:59.660]  Then you have your own thing that you control it has it has a different name and fine. You got it. All right
[1:22:00.780 --> 1:22:02.140]  I don't know we'll see how that goes
[1:22:02.140 --> 1:22:08.860]  It's it's either gonna peter out or it's going to be a thing that I'm going to have to take a little more public and then
[1:22:08.940 --> 1:22:15.340]  You know and be like no you cannot take the name mark down and I do have a nice soapbox for that
[1:22:15.340 --> 1:22:19.580]  And I have a lot of people who are probably gonna be on my side of this and then everybody's gonna be like oh my god
[1:22:19.580 --> 1:22:22.380]  I remember him talking to Marco about that on his podcast a couple weeks ago
[1:22:22.940 --> 1:22:26.460]  You can even trademark it maybe yeah, well probably isn't worth it. I mean
[1:22:27.260 --> 1:22:29.260]  I probably should try
[1:22:29.260 --> 1:22:33.820]  I don't know it's probably it probably is not worth it on might be harder because it's a general it's a
[1:22:34.220 --> 1:22:40.140]  You know getting a regular word even though the pun involved in the name. I think it's I still think it's rather clever
[1:22:40.300 --> 1:22:43.500]  But I don't know it might be hard because it's a dictionary
[1:22:44.220 --> 1:22:47.900]  I'm not a trademark lawyer. I've arrived filed for a number of trademarks now
[1:22:47.900 --> 1:22:49.900]  So I'm familiar with the process and
[1:22:51.020 --> 1:22:53.020]  from what I understand
[1:22:54.060 --> 1:22:57.980]  You know you could you could almost definitely trademark it. It doesn't matter that you haven't yet
[1:22:58.300 --> 1:23:02.300]  It doesn't matter that it's out there. You know the fact is it's still your thing your project
[1:23:02.620 --> 1:23:06.460]  Yeah, it is not become a generic term that describes all things like this
[1:23:07.100 --> 1:23:10.300]  it is still a specific thing that that you made and
[1:23:10.940 --> 1:23:12.940]  You could just make the
[1:23:12.940 --> 1:23:17.820]  You know like when you this is a very common thing. I hear people talking incorrectly about on podcast all the time
[1:23:18.620 --> 1:23:24.620]  They assume that a trademark is is like a universally unique name right when in fact when you file for a trademark
[1:23:24.620 --> 1:23:29.100]  You have to you have to file for it in certain relatively narrow categories and
[1:23:29.660 --> 1:23:33.660]  The more broadly you want that trademark to apply the harder it is to get and
[1:23:34.460 --> 1:23:39.100]  Sometimes it is it possible to get it more broadly. There might be someone else that's too close to you so like
[1:23:39.100 --> 1:23:43.500]  So you know like you like I had to file for overcast's trademark
[1:23:43.980 --> 1:23:48.940]  Within like the parameters of a website that does that that you know
[1:23:48.940 --> 1:23:56.060]  Let's people search and find and play podcasts and also a mobile application. Let's people search and find and play podcast and audio files and you know
[1:23:56.060 --> 1:23:58.060]  you have to you have to be that specific and
[1:23:59.900 --> 1:24:02.860]  And you know the and the more the more generic and overcast is a word
[1:24:02.860 --> 1:24:06.860]  It's an English dictionary word, but I still have a trademark pending on it that looks like it's gonna go through just fine
[1:24:06.860 --> 1:24:08.860]  and
[1:24:08.860 --> 1:24:13.580]  There are other trademarks of the word that are in different industries and that's fine too and so yeah
[1:24:14.140 --> 1:24:17.100]  Trademarks are are limited to a certain scope
[1:24:17.100 --> 1:24:22.140]  And if you make that scope narrow enough you can trademark almost anything. Yeah, it's not like getting the Twitter account name
[1:24:22.700 --> 1:24:24.700]  That's impossible. Yeah
[1:24:25.100 --> 1:24:30.140]  Every time it comes up where someone's like oh, yeah, I how do I want to recover this abandoned name on Twitter
[1:24:30.460 --> 1:24:33.420]  Every time this comes up. There's like three people who are like oh, I know a guy
[1:24:33.420 --> 1:24:35.500]  I can't or oh, yeah
[1:24:35.500 --> 1:24:40.380]  You could just email this person and every time if anyone else does it they can't do it anymore
[1:24:40.380 --> 1:24:47.820]  The process has now changed. It is not more strict. You know, sorry. Can't do it. Yeah, I think there might have been some Lucy Lucy early days where you could get
[1:24:48.780 --> 1:24:49.500]  a
[1:24:49.500 --> 1:24:57.260]  You know like in 2009 you could still get a claimed but vacant Twitter name, but it's it's I don't know
[1:24:57.260 --> 1:24:59.900]  I think for obvious reasons that it's gotten harder
[1:24:59.900 --> 1:25:04.700]  I have at mark down. I don't think I've ever even posted from it, but I do have that
[1:25:04.700 --> 1:25:08.080]  Do you know this? I think I talked about this on the show, but it was years ago
[1:25:09.620 --> 1:25:11.620]  Do you know who wanted to buy it from me?
[1:25:12.460 --> 1:25:19.980]  Matt Mullenmug nope Glenn Beck what talk show right wing talk show personality Glenn Beck
[1:25:20.220 --> 1:25:25.300]  Does he have like a show with that name or something? He started he got involved in some kind of
[1:25:25.300 --> 1:25:27.300]  um
[1:25:29.540 --> 1:25:31.540]  Like an overstock.com
[1:25:32.180 --> 1:25:34.180]  competitor
[1:25:34.180 --> 1:25:38.740]  Okay, so it's like price mark down either. Yeah, or maybe it was like group on or something
[1:25:38.740 --> 1:25:42.980]  I went and looked at it and tried to figure out what the hell it was and I was just like no
[1:25:42.980 --> 1:25:48.980]  So I just I got emails from there that they wanted to make a very serious offer about the Twitter account and I
[1:25:49.620 --> 1:25:51.620]  Just never answered them
[1:25:51.620 --> 1:25:56.660]  That that is that is really truly summer. I just couldn't live with myself. I don't want to hear the number
[1:25:57.620 --> 1:26:01.460]  Because I don't think it would have been that big anyway. I really don't I doubt it
[1:26:01.620 --> 1:26:04.660]  I don't think it would have been an offer that I couldn't refuse
[1:26:05.060 --> 1:26:07.540]  But I was afraid that it would be an offer. I couldn't refuse
[1:26:08.340 --> 1:26:13.380]  So on the other hand, it would be nice to take a whole lot of Glenn Beck's money. Oh, I don't know there's something about that
[1:26:14.580 --> 1:26:20.100]  Yeah, I thought of that too that wouldn't it be nice to you know buy a new car with Glenn Beck's money
[1:26:20.100 --> 1:26:22.180]  But then I don't know there's something about taking his money that
[1:26:23.540 --> 1:26:28.420]  And I don't know but anyway, he wanted to buy it, but I think his whole thing fell apart anyway now and his mark down is
[1:26:29.780 --> 1:26:32.580]  Not even remembered. I don't think anybody remembered it
[1:26:33.780 --> 1:26:35.780]  Remember him
[1:26:35.780 --> 1:26:40.660]  I don't know because he's not on TV anymore. I still be pops up on the politics sites. I read every once in a while
[1:26:41.460 --> 1:26:47.860]  You can actually you actually read politics. I can I like politics make me so angry like every every political news thing
[1:26:47.860 --> 1:26:52.340]  I've ever read is just made me angry. So I just tried to avoid it as much as I used to be really into it when I
[1:26:52.820 --> 1:26:57.140]  Another enormous digression, but circa 2002 when I thought you know what?
[1:26:57.140 --> 1:26:59.380]  I've got to start a blog and it was
[1:27:00.180 --> 1:27:04.100]  Maybe it wasn't quite 50 50 and I know in hindsight everybody's gonna say come on
[1:27:04.100 --> 1:27:10.020]  It couldn't have been but it felt closer to 50 50 me whether I would write about tech and et cetera
[1:27:10.420 --> 1:27:14.580]  Or politics and et cetera and then I thought well, maybe I'll start the
[1:27:14.580 --> 1:27:19.860]  The during fireball one first, which I always knew was gonna be the name of this one
[1:27:21.700 --> 1:27:25.940]  And I thought maybe I'll start a second blog. I even have a name for it, but I won't I can't say what it is
[1:27:27.220 --> 1:27:32.340]  Where I would write about politics, but it's just to me. It's not that it makes me angry anymore
[1:27:32.340 --> 1:27:37.060]  It just bores me it bores me to death. Yeah, cuz it's the same story all the time, you know
[1:27:37.940 --> 1:27:43.540]  Everyone's getting screwed these people are you know being bribed or being bought by lobbyists and you know
[1:27:43.540 --> 1:27:49.140]  The common people are getting screwed even further and everything just sucks and there's no hope inside like that's basically it
[1:27:49.540 --> 1:27:52.900]  Like if you if you boil it down, that's basically what every political
[1:27:53.380 --> 1:27:56.740]  Story is yeah, I think if I had been alive
[1:27:57.460 --> 1:28:04.420]  If my you know been born a few decades earlier and had been at good same like a columnist typewriter in the 70s or 80s
[1:28:04.420 --> 1:28:10.100]  I think it would have been bought politics because I think it was so much more interesting than and I know there's a lot of a lot
[1:28:10.100 --> 1:28:14.020]  Of that some of the problems were very exactly the same and a partisan ship and stuff, but
[1:28:15.780 --> 1:28:22.020]  It wasn't the money wasn't as as corrosive. It wasn't so much that it was really all just about business, you know
[1:28:22.020 --> 1:28:26.420]  It was it was more you know the partisanship was actually interesting and kind of fun to write about
[1:28:27.540 --> 1:28:31.620]  I guess think it's funny also that you know you and I have a similar problem
[1:28:31.620 --> 1:28:35.140]  You have it to a larger scale because your audience is much larger than mine
[1:28:35.940 --> 1:28:37.940]  We have a similar problem in that
[1:28:37.940 --> 1:28:42.500]  We say things that are opinionated about topics that shouldn't be
[1:28:43.220 --> 1:28:45.780]  Emotionally charged, but for many people they are and
[1:28:47.140 --> 1:28:48.740]  We get a lot of
[1:28:48.740 --> 1:28:51.140]  Craft from people who are like
[1:28:51.620 --> 1:28:56.580]  Unreasonably surprisingly angry about some statement we make about like a phone
[1:28:57.540 --> 1:29:05.220]  I can't even imagine what it would take in your mind to think that it would be a good idea to enter political writing as an additional thing that you did
[1:29:05.780 --> 1:29:07.300]  from that point of view
[1:29:07.300 --> 1:29:11.220]  Yeah, and when I've dabbled in it on Daring Fireball, it's you know
[1:29:11.620 --> 1:29:14.500]  I don't mind the criticism, but it was enormous
[1:29:14.500 --> 1:29:20.260]  It was it peaked in 2008 with the Sarah Palin thing because I couldn't I couldn't not hold my tongue
[1:29:20.260 --> 1:29:22.980]  I was so clear that the woman was this you know
[1:29:24.660 --> 1:29:29.700]  Borderline mentally disabled. I mean, you know real real real
[1:29:30.580 --> 1:29:37.220]  Problem and she was scary time right when it appeared that like there was a very good chance like most people
[1:29:37.220 --> 1:29:41.620]  Today who weren't voting or paying attention in 2008 don't realize that like
[1:29:42.340 --> 1:29:46.580]  There was a very good chance Sarah Palin was going to be president right because you know McCain
[1:29:46.740 --> 1:29:50.340]  Yeah, McCain still around now, but at the time everyone's looking at McCain saying he's not in great health
[1:29:50.420 --> 1:29:54.100]  He's pretty old. He was like one of the oldest people to run for president
[1:29:54.100 --> 1:30:00.580]  Well, and there was a tremendous and I think well grounded fear that the polling numbers might be severely off
[1:30:00.980 --> 1:30:06.020]  Because there were an awful lot of people who wouldn't want to tell a pollster that they wouldn't vote for the black guy
[1:30:06.020 --> 1:30:09.460]  But when they go in it in the privacy of the voting booth would
[1:30:10.580 --> 1:30:14.500]  There was a very real chance that McCain and Palin were going to win and
[1:30:15.220 --> 1:30:18.820]  And because of McCain's age and health there was a good chance
[1:30:18.820 --> 1:30:22.740]  He might not make it a for a full eight years and that she might become president like
[1:30:22.740 --> 1:30:27.460]  The these were really like non-trivial possibilities and when I'd write about her man
[1:30:27.460 --> 1:30:33.540]  People would just certain subset of people would just go not and it was funny because some of them were clearly themselves
[1:30:33.540 --> 1:30:36.980]  Very low IQ but others were not others were you know
[1:30:36.980 --> 1:30:42.740]  But that you know there because that's their side and and they'd say you know if she was a Democrat
[1:30:42.740 --> 1:30:48.980]  You love it. It's like no if she was if I'm not that partisan. It's like my politics are certainly not conservative, but I'm not
[1:30:50.660 --> 1:30:55.860]  You know if if if of true moron ran on the Democratic ticket, I would do the same thing
[1:30:56.660 --> 1:30:59.380]  Like it's way more dangerous way more dangerous
[1:30:59.380 --> 1:31:03.540]  I prefer to have a Democrat in the White House than a Republican. I do
[1:31:04.020 --> 1:31:06.020]  But I would much rather have
[1:31:06.740 --> 1:31:09.380]  any Republican of reasonable intelligence
[1:31:10.420 --> 1:31:12.420]  And a moron who's a Democrat
[1:31:13.140 --> 1:31:17.220]  I think that's terrifying like you know because when the Democrats sell out the public
[1:31:17.620 --> 1:31:23.860]  They at least try to do it quietly and and in subtle in more subtle ways that are less likely be traced back to them
[1:31:24.420 --> 1:31:28.820]  The Republicans have have learned that they can sell out the public in public
[1:31:28.820 --> 1:31:29.940]  like
[1:31:29.940 --> 1:31:31.140]  you know
[1:31:31.140 --> 1:31:33.940]  Brashley they can they can just they can do
[1:31:34.740 --> 1:31:38.020]  Things that seem ridiculous to to thinking people
[1:31:39.380 --> 1:31:46.500]  But they can get away with it because no one cares it like they just the public does not give a crap and so
[1:31:47.060 --> 1:31:53.220]  They just they can they can do it really at least at least the Democrats give us the illusion that they are like that
[1:31:53.220 --> 1:31:56.340]  They have us in mind which of course they don't but at least they give us that illusion
[1:31:56.340 --> 1:31:58.340]  and
[1:31:58.340 --> 1:32:00.340]  Here's Mark Oeg's
[1:32:00.340 --> 1:32:06.820]  Proving in the email I'll get in the coming seven days exactly why I made the right choice into that totally no
[1:32:06.820 --> 1:32:14.100]  And I think I think it's best for for you and I to keep doing what we already do with this issue which is like
[1:32:14.980 --> 1:32:16.980]  for truly important issues
[1:32:16.980 --> 1:32:18.980]  blog about them on our tech blogs
[1:32:20.180 --> 1:32:22.980]  Because if you know if we if either of us had a political blog
[1:32:22.980 --> 1:32:28.500]  The only people who would read it would people who agree with us. Yeah, it's true basically or and yeah
[1:32:28.500 --> 1:32:32.180]  They are be occasional drive by trolls who wanted to yell at us, but that doesn't really do anything
[1:32:32.660 --> 1:32:36.820]  And so I think I think you could make more of a difference
[1:32:37.540 --> 1:32:41.220]  For a cause you care about by not usually being political and
[1:32:41.940 --> 1:32:47.620]  Choosing occasional times where it's worth it to be and then you kind of trick some people who don't agree with you into seeing that opinion
[1:32:48.020 --> 1:32:51.300]  Yeah, here's the thing I keep thinking about when I look back at it
[1:32:51.300 --> 1:32:57.860]  I think that I wish that our system were set up in a way that it would be a lot easier for whoever won the last election to get
[1:32:58.100 --> 1:33:00.100]  Whatever shit done that they want and
[1:33:00.420 --> 1:33:02.420]  And if it turns out to be unpopular
[1:33:02.980 --> 1:33:07.700]  They're gonna get voted out and whoever comes in next can undo it. I think there should be a lot more
[1:33:10.420 --> 1:33:17.140]  Of that whereas we've got a system now where it's like nothing happens right like one one major. I know I'm
[1:33:17.140 --> 1:33:22.340]  Exaggerating to some extent, but really only one major thing has happened since Obama
[1:33:22.980 --> 1:33:28.900]  Was elected president, which is the health care reform. All right, and look at how well that like everyone keeps trying to repeal that
[1:33:29.140 --> 1:33:34.580]  Somehow it's just chemical, you know, but and that's one thing right and yeah, it's a big thing
[1:33:34.580 --> 1:33:39.860]  But still like that somebody's gonna say, you know, it's because you know that people are gonna email me and say
[1:33:39.860 --> 1:33:45.300]  It's because Obama's a terrible president and a bad leader blah blah blah, but it's not it's because it's so the system is set up in a way
[1:33:45.300 --> 1:33:50.180]  That nobody can get anything done Bush didn't get much done other than start the wars in terms of major
[1:33:50.820 --> 1:33:59.140]  Accomplishments because it was like this thing that both sides could somehow for a few brief years. It was like everybody felt like we had to get behind them
[1:34:01.140 --> 1:34:06.420]  I'm not saying I was behind it, but I'm just saying that like Democrats who were in the Senate and House also voted for it
[1:34:06.740 --> 1:34:10.500]  It was something that but other than that not much, you know, nobody passes anything
[1:34:10.500 --> 1:34:11.380]  I think it would be so much better
[1:34:11.380 --> 1:34:18.660]  And I say this knowing that in my lifetime there will be republican presidents and republicans control of the House and Senate
[1:34:19.140 --> 1:34:20.660]  And all those things have been flow
[1:34:20.660 --> 1:34:24.740]  I'd rather see even the republicans get to get more of their stuff done while they're
[1:34:25.460 --> 1:34:26.740]  winning
[1:34:26.740 --> 1:34:33.220]  And vice versa then the current system which seems to be set up basically around the idea of let's try to make sure nobody can do anything
[1:34:33.860 --> 1:34:38.100]  Yeah, it seems like there there are some like security holes and in the procedures
[1:34:38.100 --> 1:34:42.260]  In congress where like you know, it's very easy for
[1:34:43.060 --> 1:34:49.460]  For a party to block everything ever even when they're not really in power like the whole filibuster thing and certain majority rules
[1:34:49.540 --> 1:34:51.540]  Like there are certain things where like it's just
[1:34:52.500 --> 1:34:56.260]  It seems like when these rules were considered or made or implemented
[1:34:56.340 --> 1:34:59.540]  It was not really it was not really a thought put into it that
[1:35:00.340 --> 1:35:04.580]  What if one party or the other just decides to block everything for a decade
[1:35:04.580 --> 1:35:08.980]  Like it just says no to everything that party ever does for a decade and no one ever compromised on and out on anything
[1:35:08.980 --> 1:35:13.140]  Like I think that thought never crossed anyone's mind before because it never really happened before
[1:35:13.620 --> 1:35:16.180]  Yeah, and now that now we're being shown
[1:35:16.900 --> 1:35:21.780]  Oh, this is kind of a problem because we can't get anything done even things that are fairly moderate
[1:35:22.100 --> 1:35:24.500]  Like we can't even get moderate things past
[1:35:25.540 --> 1:35:30.740]  So yeah, I could use some rethought like some some some rule changes in congress
[1:35:30.740 --> 1:35:36.820]  Just just to just to make it so that it's possible to get something through you know for for whoever has an
[1:35:37.380 --> 1:35:42.260]  The technical majority. Yeah, and I think in terms of looking at a career as a you know
[1:35:42.980 --> 1:35:46.260]  Podcasting host and a columnist on a blog
[1:35:46.900 --> 1:35:48.820]  You know that that's what I mean when I say it to me
[1:35:48.820 --> 1:35:50.820]  It's just it would be it would be too boring
[1:35:50.900 --> 1:35:53.140]  I think I you know I might have burned down on it
[1:35:53.140 --> 1:35:55.620]  Not because I would have worked harder at it or that it would have been
[1:35:56.180 --> 1:35:58.580]  More stressful it I think I would have burned out from boredom
[1:35:58.580 --> 1:36:01.140]  You know like I think what makes what we talk about in general
[1:36:01.380 --> 1:36:04.100]  Interesting is how quickly things can change you know
[1:36:04.260 --> 1:36:06.260]  I mean just look at the phones alone
[1:36:06.580 --> 1:36:08.580]  That we've gone from a world
[1:36:08.580 --> 1:36:14.980]  You know where the iPhone didn't exist seven years ago or I guess it would just come out a couple weeks ago
[1:36:15.460 --> 1:36:16.820]  Seven years ago
[1:36:16.900 --> 1:36:22.340]  To a world where IBM and Apple are selling iPhones together to corporate customers. It's crazy
[1:36:22.980 --> 1:36:24.980]  Yeah, that's pretty nuts
[1:36:24.980 --> 1:36:27.380]  All right, let me thank our second sponsor. It's our good friends at

[1:39:03.700 --> 1:39:09.620]  With Amy having a drink and on on the TV behind the bar. It's showing ESPN and
[1:39:10.420 --> 1:39:15.620]  You know, I see a TV. I'm gonna pay attention to it and all of a sudden Adam Lisa Gore is on TV. Oh
[1:39:15.620 --> 1:39:22.420]  Yeah, for what that there's a commercial that he shot a sandwich video for a company called true car
[1:39:22.420 --> 1:39:28.660]  TR U E C A R it's the future of car buying. I actually haven't watched the whole thing
[1:39:28.660 --> 1:39:30.740]  I was in a bar. I couldn't hear it all I did was see him
[1:39:32.180 --> 1:39:35.300]  Now his videos have gone on real TV like national TV
[1:39:35.860 --> 1:39:40.020]  That's gotta be like that's definitely strange thing to see like your friend all of a sudden up here on TV
[1:39:40.020 --> 1:39:43.940]  I went nuts. I think I'm usually a pretty, you know, I was like that
[1:39:43.940 --> 1:39:47.220]  I know that guy that's my he's been on my show
[1:39:47.940 --> 1:39:50.340]  Right guy and there he is up there
[1:39:50.580 --> 1:39:55.380]  And it's just a classic sandwich video there. He's the spokesman. He's in it. He's all you know
[1:39:56.180 --> 1:39:58.180]  That's awesome. I
[1:39:58.580 --> 1:40:03.700]  Am so happy for him for everything. He's like I remember back when he was you know before he started sandwich video
[1:40:04.260 --> 1:40:07.940]  He was just doing like video work for people and he didn't seem like he was that happy doing it
[1:40:07.940 --> 1:40:09.460]  I don't want to you know, I don't want to put words in his mouth
[1:40:09.460 --> 1:40:15.060]  But it seemed like he was he was not incredibly happy with his previous jobs and he
[1:40:15.940 --> 1:40:18.340]  He did this thing on his own and it's just exploded
[1:40:18.900 --> 1:40:24.340]  He is because like now everyone sees how cool he is like at his his style
[1:40:25.060 --> 1:40:31.540]  How talented he is and how good his work is and and his unique like style and voice that he puts into these things
[1:40:32.020 --> 1:40:36.260]  That are so appealing to so many people like it's so great to see your friends have that kind of success
[1:40:36.260 --> 1:40:40.260]  And he's like the nicest guy in the world. You know, it couldn't happen to be a better guy
[1:40:40.260 --> 1:40:44.980]  No, he's such a thrill, but it's so it's so because to it's like
[1:40:47.940 --> 1:40:52.820]  Who would have thought that he you know, he just doesn't look like what you think of as celebrity pitch man
[1:40:53.380 --> 1:40:56.340]  Right, he's and he's like deadpan and like so like muted
[1:40:56.420 --> 1:40:58.420]  Right, and and it works and it works really well
[1:40:58.420 --> 1:41:03.460]  I mean we we you know, we you know, we all thought that you know like internet nerds because when you would see his videos previous videos
[1:41:03.460 --> 1:41:07.060]  And love them, but yeah, I think it's it's a surprise
[1:41:07.700 --> 1:41:12.340]  In a very good way that wow everyone else feels this way too. It's it's like it like
[1:41:13.940 --> 1:41:19.860]  Nerdy smart stuff like what we so often like around these parts is now popular everywhere
[1:41:20.820 --> 1:41:26.100]  It was so funny like I was making the directory in overcast and I had like we put together directory a few days ago and and
[1:41:27.300 --> 1:41:30.580]  Jason Snell suggested this category titled pop culture
[1:41:30.580 --> 1:41:34.420]  and almost everything in it is about geek culture
[1:41:35.620 --> 1:41:37.700]  And part of that's because Jason snell's a geek like us
[1:41:38.580 --> 1:41:44.660]  But part of it's also because geek culture now is pop culture, and that was a very strange thing to realize
[1:41:45.220 --> 1:41:52.180]  Right, yeah, like the thing the other day where that turned out that it turns out the next door is a woman and
[1:41:52.740 --> 1:41:55.380]  It was like I couldn't like it was on every site
[1:41:55.380 --> 1:42:00.420]  It didn't matter whether it was a geek site or like a mainstream site. It was covered with equal
[1:42:01.300 --> 1:42:03.300]  you know
[1:42:03.300 --> 1:42:05.300]  Excitement and you know
[1:42:06.340 --> 1:42:09.300]  It was a perfect example to me because I remember growing up
[1:42:10.260 --> 1:42:16.100]  What happened comic books would be like something like only the other kids in fifth grade were talking about
[1:42:16.580 --> 1:42:21.620]  You couldn't turn on TV and find out about the new spider-man outfit, you know, I mean
[1:42:21.620 --> 1:42:25.460]  Yeah, well cuz they weren't making movies that made billions of dollars with
[1:42:26.100 --> 1:42:33.780]  Right, but it's just funny how it's crossed over and but that's the thing though is that it's I think it's highly doubtful that
[1:42:34.260 --> 1:42:40.020]  The you know all sorts of stuff that happens in the comic books doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna happen in the movies
[1:42:40.420 --> 1:42:47.060]  You know, so it's it's only in the comic books where there's gonna be a where Thor is now a woman
[1:42:47.060 --> 1:42:51.540]  I mean, I guess it could eventually be turned into a movie. I don't know
[1:42:51.540 --> 1:42:59.620]  But I love that you've had me on here to talk about IBM TV and comics comics. I'm like so incredibly
[1:43:00.820 --> 1:43:02.820]  I don't read comic
[1:43:02.820 --> 1:43:07.460]  Babies I just think it's inner. I just think it's an interesting example of what you were talking about
[1:43:08.100 --> 1:43:10.900]  Yeah, I think I think it's more like, you know, it's
[1:43:12.180 --> 1:43:16.420]  A lot of people know, you know a one or two nerds who or maybe you are one of these nerds
[1:43:16.420 --> 1:43:18.420]  who
[1:43:18.420 --> 1:43:21.300]  You were a nerd socially growing up. It did not serve you well
[1:43:22.020 --> 1:43:25.860]  And then you got a job that paid you good money and then all of a sudden people are interested in you
[1:43:26.580 --> 1:43:28.820]  I feel like that has happened to the entire
[1:43:29.620 --> 1:43:33.780]  Nerd industry like the whole nerd and all the geeky category of things like
[1:43:34.500 --> 1:43:36.260]  Now geeks are big business, you know
[1:43:36.260 --> 1:43:38.260]  We we control all the internet stuff
[1:43:38.420 --> 1:43:42.660]  Our comic books and all that crap are now like billion dollar movie franchises and stuff like that
[1:43:42.660 --> 1:43:46.900]  Like I feel like the rest of the world now cares about us because we have all the money
[1:43:48.100 --> 1:43:53.460]  I guess to a certain degree that describes me, but I think I was always a little bit a little bit outside that a
[1:43:54.020 --> 1:43:56.020]  little bit harder to
[1:43:56.900 --> 1:44:00.580]  Pin down in that sort of, you know, like my high school years were not unhappy
[1:44:00.820 --> 1:44:05.300]  I wasn't I wouldn't I would say anything that made me really unhappy as I just wanted to already live on my own
[1:44:05.460 --> 1:44:08.340]  Not that I don't love my person. They're not great, but I felt like I was
[1:44:08.340 --> 1:44:13.700]  I was I felt clearly able to make my own decisions about when to go to bed, you know
[1:44:14.660 --> 1:44:16.660]  Like when I was around 11
[1:44:18.180 --> 1:44:24.660]  You have now reached the conclusion of side one of your official National Lampoon stereo test and demonstration record
[1:44:25.140 --> 1:44:28.420]  And what better time for our special end of the record test
[1:44:29.060 --> 1:44:35.220]  First of all, this is a test of your equipment no matter what brand or type of record player you have
[1:44:35.220 --> 1:44:42.340]  The tone arm should now be close to the center of the record and almost at the shiny area just before the label
[1:44:42.980 --> 1:44:46.420]  If you own an automatic turntable in a few seconds
[1:44:46.420 --> 1:44:53.780]  The arm should raise itself as if by magic and then return to its rest near the outside of the unit
[1:44:54.500 --> 1:44:58.980]  If you do not have an automatic turntable, this should not happen
[1:44:59.540 --> 1:45:02.220]  The second part of this test involves you
[1:45:02.220 --> 1:45:08.700]  If you have been correctly installed as part of your stereo system, you will now lift the record up
[1:45:09.500 --> 1:45:14.300]  Turn it over and replace it on the turntable with side two on the top
[1:45:15.020 --> 1:45:18.220]  You will then proceed to listen to all of side two
[1:45:19.340 --> 1:45:21.340]  If you do not do this
[1:45:21.340 --> 1:45:34.060]  You have failed the test and you have the worst high-fi system in the world no matter how much money you spent
