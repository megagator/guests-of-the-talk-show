[00:00.000 --> 00:07.760]  Hello good sir. How you doing? Good. I wasn't really that very optimistic about Drexel's
[00:07.760 --> 00:15.840]  chance. Being a 16 seed is hard. Yeah, and they deserve to be a 16 seed. I think that
[00:15.840 --> 00:24.640]  there's a very good chance that the Drexel University Dragons of the 2020-2021 season,
[00:24.640 --> 00:32.400]  this team that got their ass kicked today by Illinois, could still go down in NCAA tournament
[00:32.400 --> 00:41.080]  history as the team to reach the tournament with the fewest wins. Yeah, that's a good
[00:41.080 --> 00:46.740]  point. They were short in season, right? They were perhaps the most shortened season of
[00:46.740 --> 00:55.520]  any team in the NCAA. They were 12-7, so they only won 12 games, including the conference
[00:55.520 --> 01:01.000]  tournament games that got them into the tournament. Yeah, I was going to say that at the very
[01:01.000 --> 01:05.560]  least, even if you were a terrible team, if you won your conference tournament, you'd
[01:05.560 --> 01:11.880]  still need to win a handful of games to do that. I looked at the bracket, and I didn't
[01:11.880 --> 01:16.280]  look at the play-in games, the teams who played yesterday, but I don't think any of them would
[01:16.280 --> 01:22.380]  do it. There were a couple of other teams that had 14 wins, but Drexel with 12 was two
[01:22.380 --> 01:29.280]  games fewer than that. I think there's a very high likelihood, knock on wood, fingers crossed,
[01:29.280 --> 01:34.840]  that we won't have another pandemic like this going forward, and there's no feasible way
[01:34.840 --> 01:42.360]  that any other team with 12 wins could possibly make the tournament. Unless it was a team
[01:42.360 --> 01:47.440]  with two wins that then somehow ran the table, which in their conference tournament seems
[01:47.440 --> 01:53.720]  almost impossible, but not entirely impossible. Right, I guess if you had a superstar player,
[01:53.720 --> 02:00.800]  like a future Michael Jordan, LeBron James caliber player who was injured or otherwise
[02:00.800 --> 02:08.080]  ineligible for your regular season, and they came back. Yeah, break them out for the tournament.
[02:08.080 --> 02:12.160]  For the tournament, and then you run the table. So yeah, I guess that's possible, but that
[02:12.160 --> 02:16.880]  it's highly unlikely. Yeah, because I don't think it's ever happened before. Well, I'm
[02:16.880 --> 02:24.640]  hopeful that one day my alma mater will also receive a 16 seed. I went to UC San Diego,
[02:24.640 --> 02:28.760]  which only went to Division One last year. This year, the small University of California
[02:28.760 --> 02:33.320]  schools are being represented by UC Santa Barbara. It's very exciting for the Gauchos
[02:33.320 --> 02:39.940]  because it's usually like UC Irvine gets that bid. Yeah, I'm hoping someday the Tritons
[02:39.940 --> 02:44.080]  of UCSD will be in there and they'll be a 16 and they'll be drummed right out and that'll
[02:44.080 --> 02:49.180]  be fun because right now I went to grad school at Cal and my dad went to Cal, so I'm a major
[02:49.180 --> 02:55.520]  sports fan for Cal, which had like won the NIT one year and when Jason Kidd played there,
[02:55.520 --> 02:59.340]  they got to the Sweet 16. That's it for their success in basketball, but I'm hoping one
[02:59.340 --> 03:05.660]  day UCSD will give me that delight of being a 16 seed that's drummed right out of the
[03:05.660 --> 03:12.600]  tournament. It's a victory of a sort to get it in. It is bizarre. I mean, it's better
[03:12.600 --> 03:16.120]  to see these games than like last year where they were canceled because the whole thing
[03:16.120 --> 03:21.200]  happened right at the outset of the pandemic. It is kind of bizarre to see them playing
[03:21.200 --> 03:28.240]  in like a Drexel's game was in like a farmhouse, you know, like an old fashioned sports fieldhouse
[03:28.240 --> 03:33.840]  that used to host basketball games like 70 years ago and, you know, they have fans I
[03:33.840 --> 03:40.920]  guess they're allowed to be like 25% capacity, but it's a weird setup where the closest fans
[03:40.920 --> 03:45.620]  are it's like they're playing inside a hockey rink, right? They in and they've got the wall
[03:45.620 --> 03:53.020]  set up. It's it's very weird, but you know, step towards normalcy. Our friend friend of
[03:53.020 --> 03:58.140]  the show mutual friend Dr. Drang. I guess he's a I don't know. I know he lives in Illinois.
[03:58.140 --> 04:05.920]  I presume he's an alumni. He was very great, very gracious winner on Twitter. So it's funny.
[04:05.920 --> 04:14.700]  Back just before the pandemic in in late December of 2019, Cal played Illinois in a bowl game
[04:14.700 --> 04:19.380]  and it was in Santa Clara at the 49ers stadium. So we went and so I got to see the Illinois
[04:19.380 --> 04:22.840]  band and it was it was a lot of fun. I'd never been to that stadium before so we and we had
[04:22.840 --> 04:27.040]  a great time and it turned out that that was the next to last live sports. I would see
[04:27.040 --> 04:33.640]  right like we went to a Warriors game in in January and then that was it. But that was
[04:33.640 --> 04:38.780]  Dr. Drang was very nice and gracious and defeat as well. He's he's a you know, he's a mysterious
[04:38.780 --> 04:45.560]  internet snowman, but also a big fan of Illinois and and and yeah, very gracious and in victory
[04:45.560 --> 04:50.840]  and defeat. He's a he's a good guy. They look very good in my opinion. I'm nowhere I'm nowhere
[04:50.840 --> 04:54.400]  near the college basketball fan I used to be but I used to be obsessed with it and I
[04:54.400 --> 04:58.520]  know a good team when I see it and they you know, all right, well, they're number one
[04:58.520 --> 05:04.620]  seed and they played a 16 seed in one big. Duh, they looked good. But they looked really
[05:04.620 --> 05:09.040]  good and and you know, reading up on them coming into this game. It's like they play
[05:09.040 --> 05:15.040]  a really good style of basketball. So I'm very bullish on the Illinois fighting Illini.
[05:15.040 --> 05:18.840]  Fighting Illini. That's right. I love a name like that. That's like the Phillies, right?
[05:18.840 --> 05:23.400]  What is Illini? I don't know. They're from Illinois. Yeah, exactly. Did you know that
[05:23.400 --> 05:31.360]  I was on the talk show almost exactly a year ago? A year ago this week, March 17. Huh.
[05:31.360 --> 05:36.640]  And that was as everything was shutting down. Huh, that rings a bell. I know that I remember
[05:36.640 --> 05:42.600]  talking to Federico while Italy was having a terrible time of it and it had come to the
[05:42.600 --> 05:47.160]  US yet. Yeah, that was the next episode was that but it was we were doing it when they
[05:47.160 --> 05:52.880]  were right when the NBA stuff was happening. And so everything was shutting down and and
[05:52.880 --> 05:55.840]  you know borders were closing all of that. And it was definitely I remember that episode
[05:55.840 --> 06:01.440]  very distinctly because we were doing a lot of well what we're saying now is true at the
[06:01.440 --> 06:05.720]  moment but tomorrow it may be completely different because it had that feeling like we were in
[06:05.720 --> 06:11.560]  the in that period of a week where everything was going to change day to day. Yeah. Yeah,
[06:11.560 --> 06:15.240]  like when you're in a building and like a weird alarm goes off and it's like what is
[06:15.240 --> 06:18.440]  that we supposed to leave and it's like I don't know maybe sort of and then they're
[06:18.440 --> 06:22.400]  like just stand by and it's like huh maybe we should get our stuff together and get ready
[06:22.400 --> 06:29.600]  to leave you know except you know the whole world. Yeah, harder to leave. I think things
[06:29.600 --> 06:33.920]  are looking up though it's a good you know it's it you know if we were on the cusp of
[06:33.920 --> 06:39.160]  everything falling apart a year ago I feel very solid I feel just as I feel like the
[06:39.160 --> 06:44.000]  odds are just as good that we're on the cusp of everything starting to come back together.
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.760]  Yeah I have optimism too you know it's tempered with the idea that if people let down their
[06:47.760 --> 06:54.320]  guard right here at the end we have the potential to have like a little bit of a blowback but
[06:54.320 --> 06:58.980]  the but that the vaccines are kind of tamping that down they're sort of like the vaccines
[06:58.980 --> 07:03.960]  are in a fight with people's enthusiasm and if you can get enough people vaccinated before
[07:03.960 --> 07:10.360]  people are too enthusiastic then you can make it work. Yeah and I'm really optimistic too
[07:10.360 --> 07:17.960]  that that by setting some gold dates not like hard and fast line in the sand July 4th you
[07:17.960 --> 07:22.920]  can party down but just you know if we keep our stuff keep our keep our acts together
[07:22.920 --> 07:28.680]  and everybody does their part you know we can we can really be back to normal by summertime
[07:28.680 --> 07:32.800]  I feel like that gives people hope and and gives you a reason to keep going even if you
[07:32.800 --> 07:38.680]  feel like um you know I would like to go eat in a restaurant right now. Yeah also I would
[07:38.680 --> 07:42.720]  say the acceleration you know you see these theoretical numbers of acceleration of vaccines
[07:42.720 --> 07:45.940]  where especially in sort of January and February they're like well there are more and there
[07:45.940 --> 07:52.320]  are more coming and all of that the last two weeks especially but over the last month I
[07:52.320 --> 07:57.360]  keep hearing first off people I know people who are in like some of the slacks that I'm
[07:57.360 --> 08:01.560]  in all of a sudden are like I got vaccinated today I got vaccinated today I'm getting it's
[08:01.560 --> 08:08.060]  like I can now feel it's not just a number on you know on the news I can feel in my own
[08:08.060 --> 08:15.680]  personal network the acceleration of vaccinations so that makes it more real too right knowing
[08:15.680 --> 08:22.200]  that my my in-laws and my mom are are vaccinated with both shots my wife's had her first shot
[08:22.200 --> 08:27.840]  I haven't because I live in my garage and don't see anyone so I'm I should probably
[08:27.840 --> 08:34.460]  be way in back of the line but um but people I know and people I know even just a little
[08:34.460 --> 08:38.960]  bit online like they all have these vaccination stories now and that's what makes me honestly
[08:38.960 --> 08:43.360]  the most optimistic is like now I can feel it for real instead of it's a personal experience
[08:43.360 --> 08:46.740]  kind of thing not me getting vaccinated but like people I know are going through that
[08:46.740 --> 08:54.120]  now then it feels like this is really happening yeah the supply you know is increasing and
[08:54.120 --> 08:59.500]  it's getting rolled out and for all the things that we can genuinely and apolitically say
[08:59.500 --> 09:06.060]  the U.S. has handled very poorly throughout the last year the one thing the U.S. is handling
[09:06.060 --> 09:13.080]  extremely well is actually vaccinating people procuring vaccines is one thing I'm actually
[09:13.080 --> 09:18.800]  getting needles into arms is another and these big FEMA sites where they've got the aid of
[09:18.800 --> 09:26.240]  the the military I know it in San Francisco Moscone I don't know if they're doing both
[09:26.240 --> 09:31.520]  north and south yeah yeah I don't know there's the Moscone there's a and there's a the Oakland
[09:31.520 --> 09:37.120]  Coliseum there's a big yeah yeah yeah I've seen some people die I what I've seen is friends
[09:37.120 --> 09:41.620]  who are taking their parents to the Oakland one yeah here in Philly we have a big convention
[09:41.620 --> 09:48.000]  center you know our version of Moscone and that's where FEMA has their site set up and
[09:48.000 --> 09:54.000]  they've just been killing it just thousands and thousands of people a day it's just a
[09:54.000 --> 09:59.120]  terrific operation and you know exceeding the goals and they've got a great system right
[09:59.120 --> 10:04.800]  now where the surplus vaccinations their surplus ability over the people who have appointments
[10:04.800 --> 10:12.040]  they're they're looking at the zip codes in the city of Philadelphia where the percentage
[10:12.040 --> 10:18.120]  of people vaccinated so far is under the average for the city as a whole and if you live in
[10:18.120 --> 10:22.140]  one of those zip codes you could just show up at the convention center wow just show
[10:22.140 --> 10:27.820]  up you know they're open till eight they recommend you get there before five and the weather
[10:27.820 --> 10:32.480]  is nice today and you could just show up so you know and anybody who's was struggling
[10:32.480 --> 10:37.180]  to like fill out the web page or something like that or you know or if you're older and
[10:37.180 --> 10:40.760]  don't know how to fill out a web page which is the thing you just show up and they're
[10:40.760 --> 10:45.820]  just telling people if you live in zip code you know one nine one oh four which is actually
[10:45.820 --> 10:50.340]  my old zip code in West Philly but I just know it just stuck out to me as being on the
[10:50.340 --> 10:54.980]  list you just show up just show up today and you can get get vaccinated and on your way
[10:54.980 --> 10:58.380]  out the door you'll just get an appointment for three weeks from today to get the second
[10:58.380 --> 11:04.260]  dose it's great news anyway isn't it funny how far we've come that you know online appointments
[11:04.260 --> 11:09.440]  and all that are so normal now and they're so efficient in a lot of ways that you can
[11:09.440 --> 11:15.260]  this is really exposed the fact that there is certainly a portion of the population that
[11:15.260 --> 11:21.680]  either due to potentially age or due to the financial issues or whatever it is like they
[11:21.680 --> 11:28.760]  don't have access you really see how the getting access to online information is is hard I
[11:28.760 --> 11:33.640]  ended up telling my mom I filled out a bunch of forms for her but I also told her call
[11:33.640 --> 11:37.340]  these numbers and that's what ended up happening is that she called the number and put her
[11:37.340 --> 11:41.100]  name in and they called her back and they said come down and get your your first shot
[11:41.100 --> 11:45.400]  today and that was what worked and you know she's got an iPad that she uses and all that
[11:45.400 --> 11:49.420]  but she still felt really flummoxed because you know there's a generation that hasn't
[11:49.420 --> 11:54.940]  waited for concert tickets on Ticketmaster or wherever or bought playoff tickets or something
[11:54.940 --> 11:59.900]  like that whereas our generation like I remember hitting the button to get those Giants playoff
[11:59.900 --> 12:06.060]  tickets and in 2010 right like that was the thing that I that I was really good at but
[12:06.060 --> 12:12.460]  there's a generation that doesn't doesn't have that doesn't get it it's it it's true
[12:12.460 --> 12:16.540]  and the other problem too is at least with like tickets you know the main way to get
[12:16.540 --> 12:21.500]  it right there's like here's the main way to just get tickets and then there's the secondary
[12:21.500 --> 12:27.780]  way which is the aftermarket for tickets whereas with the bigger problem with the vaccine vaccinations
[12:27.780 --> 12:31.980]  is nobody knows like what's the one place to go to and because there isn't right it's
[12:31.980 --> 12:37.460]  like you go to CVS you go to you go to your local stadium right you can go to your health
[12:37.460 --> 12:44.360]  provider you can go to your supermarket they all might have it right we don't know maybe
[12:44.360 --> 12:51.060]  yeah and and as we were you know learning the ropes of it it's like the different the
[12:51.060 --> 12:56.300]  different pharmacies have different systems like we've a I don't know if it's a how how
[12:56.300 --> 13:01.460]  far west it goes but there's a big chain you know CVS is national right CVS is a big one
[13:01.460 --> 13:11.100]  yes the huge presence in Philly Rite Aid R I R I T E Rite Aid Rite Aid word spread typically
[13:11.100 --> 13:16.420]  opened up next day appointments like just before midnight and it was true like and you
[13:16.420 --> 13:20.700]  could find them you know but you know a lot of times it was like you know a hundred miles
[13:20.700 --> 13:24.980]  away in southern Delaware or something like that and it's you know I don't live in Delaware
[13:24.980 --> 13:30.780]  so no good but other ones it's like and there's just sites where you'd get tips and it was
[13:30.780 --> 13:36.620]  like it's like I equate it to to like some of the discount hotel sites where it's like
[13:36.620 --> 13:41.420]  oh you know here's one of these sites where you can say where you're going and you can
[13:41.420 --> 13:45.540]  get a discount hotel room and they'll tell you like how many that's a four-star hotel
[13:45.540 --> 13:49.540]  but they won't tell you exactly which hotel but then you can go to this one website and
[13:49.540 --> 13:55.140]  you could see oh well if it has a swimming pool an indoor swimming pool and a business
[13:55.140 --> 14:04.020]  center but doesn't have a gym that's the you know the Hyatt whatever right and you can
[14:04.020 --> 14:08.580]  like backwards and it's like ah so if you know you want to go to the CVS website on
[14:08.580 --> 14:13.300]  Wednesdays they seem to update the whole week but Rite Aid you want to go every night around
[14:13.300 --> 14:19.260]  11 40 and start hitting reload but sometimes it doesn't happen till after midnight I get
[14:19.260 --> 14:24.500]  I think with the Rite Aid thing it literally came down to human beings like it wasn't automated
[14:24.500 --> 14:30.100]  like like something automatically happened at 11 45 eastern time it was like at some
[14:30.100 --> 14:36.780]  point around 11 30 somebody who worked for Rite Aid was like typing things in and when
[14:36.780 --> 14:41.540]  they were done they were done and it went live anyway it's good news here in the US
[14:41.540 --> 14:48.740]  hopefully improving elsewhere around the world too but what a year seriously let's take a
[14:48.740 --> 14:53.140]  break right off the bat and thank my friends how about we thank my friends at Squarespace
[14:53.140 --> 15:00.780]  first oh Squarespace look you want to build a website you know how I bet I bet a lot of
[15:00.780 --> 15:06.980]  people listening to my show know how to make their own website or know how to start with
[15:06.980 --> 15:11.780]  something where you actually have the source code to your website and install it yourself
[15:11.780 --> 15:19.500]  and you know at some level sort of being responsible for the website yourself the coding of it
[15:19.500 --> 15:26.060]  the design of it there does you might be taking a lot more work than you need to and especially
[15:26.060 --> 15:30.540]  if it's a website that you're being asked to build for someone you know you could send
[15:30.540 --> 15:37.860]  them to Squarespace and they can do it all in a WYSIWYG style from getting domain name

[16:54.540 --> 17:02.660]  back to two old guys talking about old max you're younger than me so sure let me be the
[17:02.660 --> 17:07.180]  same age as you now that's great I love it I want to preview what I want to talk about
[17:07.180 --> 17:11.340]  later in the show but you and I you you've you've finished up this great it is funny
[17:11.340 --> 17:15.500]  because Skype says we haven't talked for four months it feels like we've talked more recently
[17:15.500 --> 17:22.500]  than that but we text we text you know randomly which is fun well but it's also that I've
[17:22.500 --> 17:26.100]  you know I don't listen to a lot of stuff that I do I don't listen to my own show I
[17:26.100 --> 17:29.700]  can't stand it but you know and if I appear on somebody else's podcast I'll listen for
[17:29.700 --> 17:35.880]  a bit or something like that but I got into listening to the 20 for 2020 max things with
[17:35.880 --> 17:41.180]  you and I was like huh I love all these max and it's like huh I'm glad I glad I said good
[17:41.180 --> 17:45.340]  things about them because I have such fond memories of it but you have released a series
[17:45.340 --> 17:51.380]  of three I don't know what do you call them outtakes extras yeah they're like they're
[17:51.380 --> 17:55.840]  basically unedited conversations between you and me and then I did I did three with John
[17:55.840 --> 18:01.100]  Syracuse it to you guys talk the most of anybody and I felt like in the end I had sort of three
[18:01.100 --> 18:05.580]  hours of each of you that was a pretty good conversation that I used a tiny little fraction
[18:05.580 --> 18:11.300]  of in the actual shows so I released those sort of at the end of the podcast being the
[18:11.300 --> 18:19.740]  last one just dropped publicly today right the straight up 20 for 2020 episodes were
[18:19.740 --> 18:28.100]  tightly edited documentary style podcasts and and really really just exquisitely well
[18:28.100 --> 18:32.380]  done I say that not just because you're my my guest today and I want to say nice things
[18:32.380 --> 18:38.460]  about it and not just because I was featured in a few of them but for enthusiasts of old
[18:38.460 --> 18:45.180]  max or max period because some of the ones aren't even that old that that made it in
[18:45.180 --> 18:49.700]  it's just really good but I could really appreciate just how much work went into the slicing and
[18:49.700 --> 18:54.800]  dicing of okay I'm in the editing room I've talked to all of these people for all this
[18:54.800 --> 19:01.700]  time and start getting things in together like here's everybody talking about the se
[19:01.700 --> 19:07.380]  30 okay how do I org and it's just came out so well and it's like it just came out like
[19:07.380 --> 19:12.660]  butter but the outtakes they just sort of hey let's just shoot the shit for an hour
[19:12.660 --> 19:18.820]  at a time yep about it are good too and they're they're fun and it is it is sort of like we
[19:18.820 --> 19:23.380]  were doing a regular podcast like this kind of podcast that it never got posted and instead
[19:23.380 --> 19:27.020]  just became raw material for that other thing and that when I got to the end I was looking
[19:27.020 --> 19:31.300]  I was thinking can I do anything is there anything extra do I have any bonus stuff and
[19:31.300 --> 19:37.140]  I realized that between you and Syracuse I had like almost eight hours of material that
[19:37.140 --> 19:41.300]  I trimmed a little like you know John's dog starts barking at a couple of points and you
[19:41.300 --> 19:45.580]  had to go take care of something in the middle of something and like there were little bits
[19:45.580 --> 19:50.940]  here and there that I snipped but it's mostly just you know us just talking about those
[19:50.940 --> 19:55.180]  old computers and occasionally like random things you can also see there's a progression
[19:55.180 --> 19:59.580]  of me explaining what I'm doing in the first conversation that's like in June and then
[19:59.580 --> 20:05.860]  by November I'm just a beaten down man who wants desperately to be done but it is it's
[20:05.860 --> 20:11.140]  it's it's one of those things that's exactly like Mark Twain's great line about which books
[20:11.140 --> 20:16.660]  are the classics that they're the books everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read
[20:16.660 --> 20:22.860]  it's like this project is a great thing that everybody will be so happy exists for decades
[20:22.860 --> 20:28.980]  to come and that no one would have really wanted to make except you thankfully and I
[20:28.980 --> 20:33.940]  didn't know what I was getting myself into but yeah I I'm happy with the right yeah you
[20:33.940 --> 20:36.940]  put all that work in and then you look and you're like ah that's good I'm glad I did
[20:36.940 --> 20:41.080]  that but boy during the making of it I was not glad right that's a thing to put on
[20:41.080 --> 20:48.100]  the shelf you know like yeah that is there anyway I I preview of what will come later
[20:48.100 --> 20:51.860]  on this episode is I did want to have you I thought it was a nice book yeah I thought
[20:51.860 --> 20:57.940]  it would be such a great bookend for me and you to talk at length about 20 years of Mac
[20:57.940 --> 21:03.060]  OS 10 literally this weekend probably I don't know what day this show is coming out either
[21:03.060 --> 21:08.100]  the day it comes out or the day after will mark the exact 20 year anniversary of Mac
[21:08.100 --> 21:20.100]  OS 10 10.0 literally hitting the shelves yeah in a box in a box and you know it having talked
[21:20.100 --> 21:25.200]  to you at such length over the last eight months however long since we started that
[21:25.200 --> 21:30.620]  discussion about Mac hardware history I thought it would be really interesting to bookend
[21:30.620 --> 21:40.980]  it with purely talking about the other side of the coin the OS anyway that will come but
[21:40.980 --> 21:48.640]  we have some news to cover so one of the things in the last few weeks is the rare product
[21:48.640 --> 21:56.500]  cancellation from Apple in recent years the HomePod was cancelled in a in a very sad Friday
[21:56.500 --> 22:03.740]  night announcement made to friend of the show Matthew Pansarino at TechCrunch who got the
[22:03.740 --> 22:08.540]  scoop it's two in a row by the way because the previous Friday afternoon was when they
[22:08.540 --> 22:14.180]  basically canned the iMac Pro and we're recording this on a Friday afternoon so I'm a little
[22:14.180 --> 22:20.180]  worried yeah we'll see well we'll break into this conversation about Mac OS 10 10.0 with
[22:20.180 --> 22:24.600]  whatever Apple killed this week but yeah this is a bit like a one and done like here's the
[22:24.600 --> 22:32.260]  HomePod and out it goes so the the iMac Pro is an interesting thing to bookend it with
[22:32.260 --> 22:39.180]  too right because it's if that's a very different kind of cancellation we think right we don't
[22:39.180 --> 22:48.700]  know but you don't have to be even a close follower to think that based on the performance
[22:48.700 --> 22:56.060]  we're seeing from the first round of M1 Apple Silicon Macs that iMacs based on whether they
[22:56.060 --> 23:03.140]  call it the M1 or the M1X or the whatever M2 who knows what what iMacs will be will
[23:03.140 --> 23:09.140]  come out with but even if they just came out with the M1s that we have they would be excellent
[23:09.140 --> 23:17.340]  iMacs yes now maybe not quite iMac Pros and I forget all the various things that an iMac
[23:17.340 --> 23:22.140]  Pro can do in terms of like hooking up additional displays to it in addition to the built-in
[23:22.140 --> 23:28.900]  one I would presume that something that whether they still have something called iMac Pro
[23:28.900 --> 23:36.100]  in the Apple Silicon world or just have you know lesser and more expensive just plain
[23:36.100 --> 23:43.300]  iMacs that span the gamut from very consumer I just want a regular iMac to very professional
[23:43.300 --> 23:49.180]  no I want I do really hard video editing and whatever else might really press the limits
[23:49.180 --> 23:56.220]  you know software development work it just seems very clear that Apple Silicon based
[23:56.220 --> 24:01.940]  iMacs are going to compare very nicely against the Intel versions yeah undoubtedly and that
[24:01.940 --> 24:08.300]  was honestly the last two rounds of Intel iMacs at the high end of the 27 inch model
[24:08.300 --> 24:14.020]  they've been faster than the bottom rung or two of the iMac Pro because the iMac Pro hasn't
[24:14.020 --> 24:18.120]  been updated and because the iMac Pro was originally conceived in a different era where
[24:18.120 --> 24:24.380]  they weren't going to do a Mac Pro and you know so I think it does stand to reason that
[24:24.380 --> 24:29.060]  you know they can call it a Mac high-end iMacs and iMac Pro if they really want to but the
[24:29.060 --> 24:33.740]  need for it has gone away and it sounds like the Xeons that they were using aren't going
[24:33.740 --> 24:39.000]  to be made by Intel anymore and it's that seems like a product that like is just naturally
[24:39.000 --> 24:44.580]  leaving its leaving its lifespan and we know they're going to be new iMacs and the new
[24:44.580 --> 24:48.900]  iMacs are going to be faster than all the old iMacs and it's it's fine whereas the HomePod
[24:48.900 --> 24:53.140]  is very much a different story of a product that got launched with a lot they put a lot
[24:53.140 --> 24:58.420]  of effort if you think back like I remember how much effort they put into that thing and
[24:58.420 --> 25:03.340]  if the stories are to be believed there are people who've bought like bought HomePods
[25:03.340 --> 25:08.380]  in the last couple of weeks and there there is and I don't know how much you know accuracy
[25:08.380 --> 25:13.780]  there is here but it seems like there are ways for you to look and get the build date
[25:13.780 --> 25:17.660]  and it sounds like some of the HomePods that were being bought in its last week of life
[25:17.660 --> 25:24.060]  were built when the HomePod was new in the ramp which suggests strongly that Apple just
[25:24.060 --> 25:29.620]  completely misjudged the market for these and had and you know had so many to sell that
[25:29.620 --> 25:34.060]  they just sort of kept selling the first round until they were rid of them and then they
[25:34.060 --> 25:41.300]  could just dump it yeah and that is brutal if that's true maybe I don't know only Apple
[25:41.300 --> 25:46.380]  knows for sure and they're not going to say yeah they they instead I loved great moments
[25:46.380 --> 25:50.380]  in Apple PR I really love the fact that they start their announcement of the death of the
[25:50.380 --> 25:54.980]  HomePod by talking about how great the HomePod mini is right for several sentences that's
[25:54.980 --> 26:01.220]  that's great right like look over there a product that we're still selling over there
[26:01.220 --> 26:07.980]  it makes me wonder whether when Apple decided that they were going to get rid of the big
[26:07.980 --> 26:12.820]  HomePod and do the HomePod mini and it seems to me that they wouldn't call it the HomePod
[26:12.820 --> 26:18.620]  mini if they were going to get rid of the big one because it seems really weird I know
[26:18.620 --> 26:24.740]  overall Apple's marketing names can sometimes be confusing and or maybe don't quite make
[26:24.740 --> 26:30.500]  a lot of sense and you know I was pushing for them to have pro models of the iPhone
[26:30.500 --> 26:38.100]  longer than they have been but that's clarified it a little 12 pro max is a little bit of
[26:38.100 --> 26:45.700]  a mouthful but having a HomePod mini and there is no other HomePod is is weird right yeah
[26:45.700 --> 26:52.060]  it's what Federico Vitucci called it the mini version of nothing right right like it's the
[26:52.060 --> 26:57.720]  mini version of a thing that doesn't exist so what is it I think you're right in they
[26:57.720 --> 27:02.180]  obviously had they had some conflicting things one is do you want to use this as a product
[27:02.180 --> 27:07.060]  name for a product line down the road well then maybe you keep it around but yeah if
[27:07.060 --> 27:12.420]  all you're doing is swapping out the old one for the new one it seems strange that you
[27:12.420 --> 27:19.460]  would give the new one this sort of mini version of the name and then keep the one other one
[27:19.460 --> 27:23.680]  around for a little while and then get rid of it but I'm not I'm not entirely convinced
[27:23.680 --> 27:27.980]  we've seen the last HomePod product like I think we've seen the last of that HomePod
[27:27.980 --> 27:32.900]  right but would they do a different kind of HomePod and have HomePod mini and HomePod
[27:32.900 --> 27:39.380]  whatever you know and a few different versions maybe maybe I mean who knows what Apple's
[27:39.380 --> 27:46.860]  home strategy is yeah but maybe Apple doesn't even know it's unclear but you know by all
[27:46.860 --> 27:54.960]  accounts the HomePod mini is is is pretty well thought of and probably fairly successful
[27:54.960 --> 28:07.060]  but nobody really knows I don't know it it also brings to mind the iPod hi-fi right wasn't
[28:07.060 --> 28:11.460]  that the name of the product yes I got one right here I use it every day so for those
[28:11.460 --> 28:19.180]  who don't remember the iPod hi-fi was a sort of I guess I'm guessing this is pure purely
[28:19.180 --> 28:32.260]  based on memory maybe like a 2005 product yeah I mean that's that's probably 2006 2006
[28:32.260 --> 28:38.660]  okay so I was close 2006 but the you know and it was like a boombox Apple looking white
[28:38.660 --> 28:45.440]  boombox thing with a 30-pin connector on top that you could you would put an iPod onto
[28:45.440 --> 28:51.620]  it and it would charge the iPod and you could then play music from the iPod through this
[28:51.620 --> 28:57.740]  and it had apparently you know so but I've never heard one in person that and it was
[28:57.740 --> 29:04.340]  a little it was like right before when I was going to media events you know so I was only
[29:04.340 --> 29:09.340]  observing them from afar and that's you know listening to hey listen to how good these
[29:09.340 --> 29:13.940]  speakers are is one of those things you can't really simulate right by watching a video
[29:13.940 --> 29:20.940]  or something it sounds pretty good I have a Sonos five that is clearly much better that's
[29:20.940 --> 29:26.220]  about the same size but I do have it an iPod hi-fi and I'm not kidding I have it it sits
[29:26.220 --> 29:32.180]  on my desk it has an aux in plug on the back which the HomePod of course doesn't that plugs
[29:32.180 --> 29:36.260]  into my iMac and that's what I use to sort of listen to music and stuff when I'm when
[29:36.260 --> 29:40.100]  I'm working and it works great for that it still does have the dock connector on the
[29:40.100 --> 29:43.900]  top I think I've got some you know object laying over that so I don't have to look at
[29:43.900 --> 29:50.040]  it it's a but you know the truth of that product was that was it is similar to the HomePod
[29:50.040 --> 29:54.680]  in some ways now it was a reaction to the Bose sound dock being incredibly successful
[29:54.680 --> 29:58.940]  and I think reading between the lines Steve Jobs felt like they should be making that
[29:58.940 --> 30:04.860]  money and not Bose and they but then they made their mistake that is the same mistake
[30:04.860 --> 30:08.800]  they made with the HomePod which is they over engineered it they said we're going to go
[30:08.800 --> 30:13.860]  out with a product that's going to sound better and people are going to pay the premium for
[30:13.860 --> 30:18.760]  an Apple product they're going to do it because we are going to be able to beat them on sound
[30:18.760 --> 30:25.120]  quality and I think the lesson of both products is competing on sound quality is not going
[30:25.120 --> 30:31.840]  to get you a hit product because people don't care like I know you care engineer about the
[30:31.840 --> 30:36.960]  sound quality of this thing but the mass market kind of doesn't care like there is a thin
[30:36.960 --> 30:40.900]  sliver of people who really care about sound quality and then there are people who listen
[30:40.900 --> 30:45.480]  to music through an Amazon echo and they're just fine and the both of these products ended
[30:45.480 --> 30:50.980]  up being too expensive because they were over engineered and people didn't want to want
[30:50.980 --> 30:57.760]  to buy them and as much as I like it I mean I like it but the iPod HiFi I you know I didn't
[30:57.760 --> 31:01.220]  pay for it I'm going to come clean here this is Macworld's review unit that they never
[31:01.220 --> 31:07.260]  wanted back and I just took it away with me but it has it had a carrying case it has which
[31:07.260 --> 31:12.380]  I still have it has room for like 6D batteries you could run it on battery power so you can
[31:12.380 --> 31:17.620]  take it to the beach right which is another shortcoming of the HomePod I mean it's not
[31:17.620 --> 31:22.420]  portable it doesn't have an aux in it doesn't you know really is at its best when you buy
[31:22.420 --> 31:25.740]  two of them and put them in a stereo pair and it was already overpriced and now you
[31:25.740 --> 31:30.820]  have to buy two of them like there's just so many reasons why it didn't work even though
[31:30.820 --> 31:38.580]  it I would say like the iPod HiFi not a bad product like in isolation the problem is what's
[31:38.580 --> 31:44.100]  the competition what does it cost what is the competition cost and that's when it all
[31:44.100 --> 31:51.660]  falls apart yeah and it's it is a similar situation over you know it turns out overpriced
[31:51.660 --> 31:59.660]  not popular only took one stab at it before pulling it and it was it came into a market
[31:59.660 --> 32:03.140]  where there are a bunch of competing products I know the Bose thing you mentioned was very
[32:03.140 --> 32:10.180]  popular I remember JVC had a bunch of seemingly pretty popular hey stick your iPod on this
[32:10.180 --> 32:14.820]  thing you know at the one that looks kind of like a football yeah I think they had a
[32:14.820 --> 32:20.500]  couple from JVC that I came very close to buying and it just never quite pulled the
[32:20.500 --> 32:26.900]  trigger but at multiple price points but and Apple clearly came in I mean that was their
[32:26.900 --> 32:31.980]  pitch and and it's one of those things where I always say like part of being an Apple pundit
[32:31.980 --> 32:37.740]  is is really just listen to them because for the most part like if you come in totally
[32:37.740 --> 32:45.060]  cynical thinking that they're full of shit and it's all all marketing is lies and spin
[32:45.060 --> 32:49.780]  and try to see through you know what's the real no just listen to what they say and like
[32:49.780 --> 32:54.220]  when they debuted the iPod HiFi their story was this sounds so much better than other
[32:54.220 --> 32:58.900]  products on the market and we spent all this time to make it fill the room and it's and
[32:58.900 --> 33:03.600]  when the HomePod came out they it was the same thing it was this sounds so much better
[33:03.600 --> 33:10.820]  than you might think it will and we've done you know all of this computational geometry
[33:10.820 --> 33:17.060]  and and as soon as the HomePod starts playing it it does this you know it's sort of like
[33:17.060 --> 33:22.560]  sonar it start as soon as it starts playing immediately but will adjust the acoustics
[33:22.560 --> 33:30.940]  it's emitting by figuring out where it's bouncing off walls and ceilings and that's the desk
[33:30.940 --> 33:35.980]  or counter or whatever it's sitting on and adjust the acoustics accordingly and when
[33:35.980 --> 33:42.660]  they're in a pair they coordinate as a pair like two teammates on a basketball team passing
[33:42.660 --> 33:47.780]  the ball back and forth like I did that all right got it better that instantly and it's
[33:47.780 --> 33:55.540]  all true it sounds we have two in our kitchen they're actually minis now but the coordination
[33:55.540 --> 34:03.060]  between them sounds better than two it's two two of two HomePods sound better than twice
[34:03.060 --> 34:09.340]  as good as one HomePod whether they're minis or HomePods it's a better than 2x improvement
[34:09.340 --> 34:15.780]  for having two yeah and you have to experience it I'm not an expert I would never propose
[34:15.780 --> 34:22.740]  to write at an expert level of review of them audio quality wise but even as a non-expert
[34:22.740 --> 34:27.860]  it's very easy to tell that they sound more than 2x better but that is a huge part of
[34:27.860 --> 34:35.580]  the you know what was HomePod too expensive I truly believe that the true HomePod experience
[34:35.580 --> 34:40.160]  is to have two of them paired and that was a seven that's a seven hundred dollar out
[34:40.160 --> 34:48.740]  of the box setup and again and you know all sorts of people spend way more than seven
[34:48.740 --> 34:53.500]  hundred dollars on speakers for their home entertainment system or they're there even
[34:53.500 --> 34:59.260]  if it's just to listen to music in their den or their office or whatever it's there's dozens
[34:59.260 --> 35:04.300]  and dozens of stores where you can go to buy speakers that cost way more than seven hundred
[35:04.300 --> 35:09.620]  dollars and I think that might be what Apple's thinking right that if all these people are
[35:09.620 --> 35:16.380]  selling you know thousands three thousand dollar speakers and people are already buying
[35:16.380 --> 35:20.260]  two hundred dollar speakers we can you know sell three hundred dollar speakers and convince
[35:20.260 --> 35:26.020]  people of how good they are because they we really do believe that they're good and you
[35:26.020 --> 35:35.860]  know I don't know that I that's it how they could miss so badly I don't know I think sometimes
[35:35.860 --> 35:42.300]  Apple thinks that the way to win and I think this is a good trait of them culturally but
[35:42.300 --> 35:46.220]  I think sometimes they think the way to win is that they use their engineering and software
[35:46.220 --> 35:51.500]  prowess and they use their secret sauce to put it all together and make a better product
[35:51.500 --> 35:56.100]  and then people will buy it and in most categories I think it's true and that's how they've built
[35:56.100 --> 36:02.500]  their their audience and their customer base but in some categories adding in more high
[36:02.500 --> 36:10.200]  quality high-tech stuff doesn't create a product that a large enough number of people are willing
[36:10.200 --> 36:15.000]  to pay money to get the benefit out of it and you know that's and I know that that's
[36:15.000 --> 36:21.300]  kind of squishy but that's the trick is in this market there are people who recognize
[36:21.300 --> 36:26.620]  quality but are there enough of them and there are people who'd recognize quality and other
[36:26.620 --> 36:31.180]  kinds of products but are happy to listen to an Amazon echo in their kitchen and think
[36:31.180 --> 36:35.780]  it sounds fine and I think this is the challenge is that Apple's first cut at this they're
[36:35.780 --> 36:40.780]  like we're gonna make these really good and the market shrugged and with a mini it's very
[36:40.780 --> 36:48.060]  instructive right like the mini is okay what else could we do and they threw out the auto
[36:48.060 --> 36:53.700]  detecting of the location and the tuning and they reduced the number of sound emitting
[36:53.700 --> 36:58.100]  objects in there and they made it smaller and they obviously made it way cheaper to
[36:58.100 --> 37:05.500]  produce and we'll see how it does but initially at least it sounds like it's a much more likely
[37:05.500 --> 37:11.060]  to be accepted kind of product and you can get two of them for a couple hundred bucks
[37:11.060 --> 37:15.100]  you know that's it seems like a much better deal so it's fascinating to watch that too
[37:15.100 --> 37:21.740]  and just realize see how Apple realized that their first you know first cut at this using
[37:21.740 --> 37:25.500]  the sort of traditional Apple playbook of we're gonna make it higher quality it's not
[37:25.500 --> 37:31.020]  a market that's seeking that level of quality not at volumes that they want to see but it
[37:31.020 --> 37:37.620]  is it's it's clearly much more fascinating to dissect than the very simple explanation
[37:37.620 --> 37:43.740]  of hey it was way too expensive people don't want to spend $300 on each one of these things
[37:43.740 --> 37:50.780]  so you know Apple's out of touch end of story of course it was gonna fail I think it's way
[37:50.780 --> 37:56.100]  more complex than that because that as you just alluded to that's basically the knock
[37:56.100 --> 38:01.540]  against every single product Apple has ever made it was the knock against the Apple to
[38:01.540 --> 38:06.380]  compared to other personal computers it was always been the knock against the Macintosh
[38:06.380 --> 38:12.780]  compared to PCs it it's the knock now it was the knock against iPods right when the iPod
[38:12.780 --> 38:19.340]  came out and in the early days of daring fireball I made so much hay over oh my god it was so
[38:19.340 --> 38:25.940]  easy and so much fun to write about the Dell Diddy oh yeah oh I think my headline was
[38:25.940 --> 38:35.580]  right rhymes with Diddy oh what a great I the zoom all of these things and every time
[38:35.580 --> 38:41.220]  one of these things came out they were always cheaper than the iPod for the comparable specs
[38:41.220 --> 38:48.500]  and a peep and all this killer killer now the iPod fire now we got it now Microsoft's
[38:48.500 --> 38:53.140]  in the game we did it everyone we got him right finally got him we finally got him it's
[38:53.140 --> 38:59.780]  the knock against the iPhone right for sure I mean I don't want to this is not a podcast
[38:59.780 --> 39:03.740]  where we talk about Samsung phones but Samsung seems to be going through a bit of a rough
[39:03.740 --> 39:08.060]  stretch you know where now they're saying that they might cancel the note which is one
[39:08.060 --> 39:14.740]  of their two flagship lines or at least skip a year and they're there whatever they call
[39:14.740 --> 39:21.220]  the galaxy s21 whatever the you know talk about when product names not doing that great
[39:21.220 --> 39:27.060]  you know in the Android world but it's it's only eight years ago where the consensus was
[39:27.060 --> 39:33.980]  that Samsung was gonna really maybe stamp out the iPhone and on the market because they
[39:33.980 --> 39:38.060]  you know it's Samsung and then the rest of the Android phones are cheaper and they do
[39:38.060 --> 39:42.260]  the same thing and who's gonna spend all this money on an iPhone it's the exact same argument
[39:42.260 --> 39:48.180]  I think the truth is that Apple's Apple's game is value for money right it's value for
[39:48.180 --> 39:53.740]  money and when Apple fails it's not because the product is expensive it's because nobody
[39:53.740 --> 39:59.820]  sees why they pay that much like versus something else like what do I get like can you imagine
[39:59.820 --> 40:03.900]  if the HomePod had come out and the reviews and been like yeah yeah I know you can get
[40:03.900 --> 40:10.060]  one cheaper but have you heard these and it wasn't really that it was like yeah they're
[40:10.060 --> 40:14.860]  maybe a little better they're in the ballpark and I think you know for the amount of money
[40:14.860 --> 40:18.020]  that you're spending extra you need to feel like oh but these are cut above and instead
[40:18.020 --> 40:23.300]  it was like yeah Siri's not that great and the sound is fine but the Sonos sound is fine
[40:23.300 --> 40:29.340]  too and Amazon sound is pretty good too and there and you know people are like oh well
[40:29.340 --> 40:33.680]  and I don't really like the Amazon stuff sounds great do I need this what is the perceived
[40:33.680 --> 40:37.900]  value and is it worth spending the extra money on it and and I think you you end up in in
[40:37.900 --> 40:42.500]  cases where maybe Apple's instincts are no no but if you listen to these I mean you were
[40:42.500 --> 40:46.820]  there right you went through this they had rooms where we listen to the different sounds
[40:46.820 --> 40:51.360]  from the different speakers and they're like can't you tell it's different I was like yeah
[40:51.360 --> 40:57.100]  I can tell and and really knowledgeable reviewers would say yes they do sound good but the truth
[40:57.100 --> 41:06.420]  is that on their own just in a house where you've got some 200 $300 cheaper crappy speaker
[41:06.420 --> 41:11.060]  people are like yeah it's fine and that makes it a harder sell so it's that it's a tricky
[41:11.060 --> 41:17.220]  thing of like how do you get people to perceive the improved value and make it worth their
[41:17.220 --> 41:22.020]  money and there are some categories where Apple has a much harder time I think AirPods
[41:22.020 --> 41:27.060]  Max is a real question here right yeah like the and I'd say the reviews of AirPods Max
[41:27.060 --> 41:33.100]  have been more generous than of the HomePod and saying yes it's expensive but it is better
[41:33.100 --> 41:38.900]  like the noise cancellation is better and it does sound very good and and so maybe it'll
[41:38.900 --> 41:42.860]  make it in a way that the HomePod won't or maybe it won't I honestly don't know and I've
[41:42.860 --> 41:47.540]  never used that product but it is similar in that way and the question is just did they
[41:47.540 --> 41:53.300]  put enough value in it to make people justify spending the money on the more expensive thing
[41:53.300 --> 41:57.120]  is it is do they feel like they're getting their money's worth in doing that yeah AirPods
[41:57.120 --> 42:03.060]  are the exception that we'll have to go back to in a moment but I do think that maybe in
[42:03.060 --> 42:09.940]  a broad sense the there is a fundamental difference here's my spitball theory as to why Apple
[42:09.940 --> 42:18.500]  keeps failing with their hi-fi systems but succeeding with you know watches phones computers
[42:18.500 --> 42:33.340]  is that human beings are in the in on the on the whole are far more visual than aural
[42:33.340 --> 42:38.300]  people there's way more people who are willing to spend a premium for a thing that looks
[42:38.300 --> 42:49.540]  better and that they can see is better than something that sounds better AirPods are the
[42:49.540 --> 42:54.400]  exception but I would almost say that maybe AirPods success isn't about their audio quality
[42:54.400 --> 43:00.140]  but just the convenience you know of the overall experience well I would also say what is the
[43:00.140 --> 43:07.060]  what is the software you know the the synergy between software design and hardware design
[43:07.060 --> 43:12.020]  you get a payoff with something like AirPods when you do that and I think the Apple's challenge
[43:12.020 --> 43:18.620]  was something like the HomePod is that so much of it rested on Siri and and on audio
[43:18.620 --> 43:24.340]  quality which is a harder sell and like again if Siri was the best and people are like oh
[43:24.340 --> 43:28.060]  yeah I know you can get these other ones but this is the one with Siri and like oh well
[43:28.060 --> 43:32.780]  then I want that one and they they couldn't really make that claim and so that's you know
[43:32.780 --> 43:37.820]  the soft if what if software is a big way Apple differentiates itself and in this case
[43:37.820 --> 43:43.980]  the user interface is Siri which is not Apple at its best really isn't then they're behind
[43:43.980 --> 43:51.760]  the eight ball yeah and you know I I don't think in the complicated somewhat complicated
[43:51.760 --> 44:00.500]  list of reasons HomePod failed I I think the actual objective quality of Siri on its own
[44:00.500 --> 44:09.460]  second it's quality compared to competing products in the space like Alexa and Google
[44:09.460 --> 44:14.620]  Voice and whatever else but that's I think primarily Alexa especially for the audience
[44:14.620 --> 44:25.740]  of people who might buy a HomePod and then third people's opinion of Siri which in my
[44:25.740 --> 44:31.140]  opinion is far worse than the state I think that in in that rundown number one the state
[44:31.140 --> 44:37.900]  of Siri is nowhere near good enough number two it's it's quality overall compared to
[44:37.900 --> 44:43.580]  Alexa is not good enough either I also think Alexa is nowhere near good enough I think
[44:43.580 --> 44:47.900]  that all of these voice assistants are all bad they're all horrible it's different variations
[44:47.900 --> 44:53.740]  of bad for sure right but and then I think third I think people's estimation of Siri
[44:53.740 --> 44:59.500]  is even worse than one and two objectively because of their previous experiences with
[44:59.500 --> 45:07.360]  it and the sort of egg freckles aspect of you know popular cultures take on how bad
[45:07.360 --> 45:11.260]  these things are right like you know voice voice assistants are a little bit like a rental
[45:11.260 --> 45:15.300]  car company or an airline or a cable company which is that sort of like once they fail
[45:15.300 --> 45:19.740]  you you never forgive them even if that's not rational and that all of the ones in that
[45:19.740 --> 45:23.960]  category are equally bad but the one that wronged you right you just are gonna put it
[45:23.960 --> 45:27.860]  on your list and say forget that because I I do have an Amazon echo in my kitchen and
[45:27.860 --> 45:32.820]  it does do stupid things I don't think it does as many stupid things as Siri does I
[45:32.820 --> 45:39.180]  think Siri is worse but they're both not great and then Apple actually has the additional
[45:39.180 --> 45:44.260]  problem which is you have like five different devices that are listening for Siri commands
[45:44.260 --> 45:51.020]  and at various points it's been good or bad where the wrong device like I can't tell you
[45:51.020 --> 45:54.780]  how many times I've tried to play music on my home pods and my phone has started playing
[45:54.780 --> 46:00.460]  music or my Apple watch has told me that I can't play music on my Apple watch and you
[46:00.460 --> 46:05.540]  know again there are months that will go by where it's all fine right and then something
[46:05.540 --> 46:09.500]  will happen a software update will happen and then all the other Apple device multi
[46:09.500 --> 46:14.260]  device sync stuff falls apart again and you know it's all it's all in the mix but yeah
[46:14.260 --> 46:18.500]  I think Siri is properly blamed as one of the reasons that home the home pod didn't
[46:18.500 --> 46:25.140]  do well but it also is fair to say that people probably have an even worse opinion of Siri
[46:25.140 --> 46:31.060]  than that and part of the issue is that the competition although it's not great is better
[46:31.060 --> 46:39.500]  than Siri I think that that's how I'd put it too is that Alexa isn't great but and I've
[46:39.500 --> 46:44.980]  heard this about the Google Assistant too like but it's better right and compare and contrast
[46:44.980 --> 46:51.820]  with the Mac or iPhone you know either way but it you could say with the Mac that it
[46:51.820 --> 46:58.540]  this is a great laptop period it's got a great build quality it has a great hinge it has
[46:58.540 --> 47:08.100]  a great display with you know great brightness and great color fidelity and the speakers
[47:08.100 --> 47:14.520]  if you get like the the 13 inch MacBook Pro has great sound for a 13 inch laptop we can
[47:14.520 --> 47:20.780]  now say the keyboard is excellent again people just love these keyboards they feel good they're
[47:20.780 --> 47:25.940]  apparently you know now that we're so many months into the the new keyboard as durable
[47:25.940 --> 47:31.300]  as anybody would want laptop keyboards to be they've always had great track pads now
[47:31.300 --> 47:35.940]  they have greater than ever battery life the Apple silicon models have performance that
[47:35.940 --> 47:44.580]  cannot be matched by any laptop of any kind any brand even like big old 17 inch PC gaming
[47:44.580 --> 47:54.920]  laptops you know this is a great laptop but you can also say Mac OS X is see I'm calling
[47:54.920 --> 48:01.500]  it that but Mac OS is the best PC operating system and it has the best apps and it's just
[48:01.500 --> 48:07.940]  a great interface and that's a reason to buy them too and it's you know you you could buy
[48:07.940 --> 48:11.940]  it for the OS and get a great laptop or you can buy it because you think it's a great
[48:11.940 --> 48:16.540]  laptop and even if you're gonna mostly just run browser tabs even if you're just gonna
[48:16.540 --> 48:22.940]  mostly run Chrome it is a great laptop and you're not really in the Mac software ecosystem
[48:22.940 --> 48:30.340]  but Mac Mac OS is a great place to run Chrome you know it's and the HomePod because Siri
[48:30.340 --> 48:36.780]  plays that role for the HomePod it and it's like you know where where would MacBook sales
[48:36.780 --> 48:48.020]  be if Mac OS were of the quality and competitive quality of Siri possibly you know if it had
[48:48.020 --> 48:54.480]  happened 20 years ago it possibly out of business really right I think that that's the thing
[48:54.480 --> 48:58.320]  that people who say like oh people just buy Apple stuff because it's cool or because they
[48:58.320 --> 49:03.380]  want to show off the you know that they've afforded an expensive computer that was always
[49:03.380 --> 49:08.820]  to me just one of the most furious arguments because you know I always saw the value in
[49:08.820 --> 49:13.180]  the Mac I always felt the Mac was better I thought I never felt like I was using a Mac
[49:13.180 --> 49:19.280]  because I wanted to spite Microsoft and that I knew that it was better over on the other
[49:19.280 --> 49:25.020]  side there were some moments in the 90s where it was close but I never felt that way I always
[49:25.020 --> 49:30.640]  felt like the product was superior in some way and yeah that's that's always the thing
[49:30.640 --> 49:35.720]  to think about is like where are the places where Apple is behind versus the places where
[49:35.720 --> 49:40.760]  they have some advantage and Siri has I mean Siri was first so they were ahead then but
[49:40.760 --> 49:45.820]  they have been behind with Siri for quite a while now yeah and I mean and you can say
[49:45.820 --> 49:52.860]  that there are areas where the Mac falls short you know like a glaring one is that there
[49:52.860 --> 49:59.220]  is no way to buy a big screen laptop other than spending a large amount of money on a
[49:59.220 --> 50:05.900]  MacBook Pro there's no equivalent of a 15 inch or 16 inch MacBook Air that's a big hole
[50:05.900 --> 50:12.540]  in the product line you know there's it's not like it's perfect but overall it's just
[50:12.540 --> 50:19.620]  a basic fundamental story of it is great hardware and it is a great software and it may not
[50:19.620 --> 50:23.180]  be for you maybe it's not your favorite software but you can certainly argue that for many
[50:23.180 --> 50:29.500]  people it is superior to the options and the HomePod didn't have that and I think I think
[50:29.500 --> 50:34.140]  it's this big blind spot on Apple maybe not I don't know maybe they knew it maybe they
[50:34.140 --> 50:37.980]  just had this sunken feeling the whole time like Siri is going to sync this product this
[50:37.980 --> 50:42.900]  is great speaker system and the damn thing's going to be sunk and and they're they're not
[50:42.900 --> 50:48.360]  like I don't know internally they're maybe they're not maybe they're as frustrated and
[50:48.360 --> 50:54.220]  angry about Siri as we are and they just can't figure out how to fix it and everything they
[50:54.220 --> 51:02.380]  do to try doesn't really seem to push it over the edge I don't know I also wonder with HomePod
[51:02.380 --> 51:09.440]  particularly how clarified Apple's view was from the get-go on what exactly is the reason
[51:09.440 --> 51:18.120]  to buy this yeah is it is it for great sound from music or is it to have a smart thing
[51:18.120 --> 51:23.140]  to talk to and say hey dingus you know what's on my calendar today and what's the weather
[51:23.140 --> 51:32.500]  and whatever else you can talk to and it's also a you know home kit hub and and the new
[51:32.500 --> 51:38.540]  HomePod mini is also has like the thread radio stuff in it and that's right I think you're
[51:38.540 --> 51:42.340]  right I think that there's a question of like what is the actual story of the product and
[51:42.340 --> 51:47.140]  that's the opportunity for the HomePod and the HomePod mini like in the future for Apple
[51:47.140 --> 51:51.260]  is this question of like where do your products fit in in the home because you know there
[51:51.260 --> 51:54.380]  were those rumors originally that the HomePod was gonna have a screen on top and it ends
[51:54.380 --> 51:57.740]  up with this sort of like shifty color II thing and I was thinking like what would you
[51:57.740 --> 52:01.380]  put in the screen but I think you know you could have a product called a HomePod that
[52:01.380 --> 52:07.560]  was a home kit hub and maybe had an actual screen on the top so you could tap to turn
[52:07.560 --> 52:12.600]  on something or set a mode or do other home kit kind of stuff and then it was also a speaker
[52:12.600 --> 52:18.380]  and maybe it was also Wi-Fi like there's lots of ideas about how you could create a HomePod
[52:18.380 --> 52:28.060]  product that would be like super appley smart home something but HomePod itself never really
[52:28.060 --> 52:32.520]  it was like a high-end speaker that had Siri in it that was sort of the concept and I'm
[52:32.520 --> 52:37.460]  not sure that's a focused enough concept yeah I don't think it was either I really don't
[52:37.460 --> 52:43.900]  I don't know I'm sad to see it go because I really like it I really do I actually bought
[52:43.900 --> 52:48.960]  two more since they canceled it to get them while I could I really like it I just wonder
[52:48.960 --> 52:56.220]  like if they had gotten the Apple TV pairing stuff right which you know my pal Mike Hurley
[52:56.220 --> 53:01.620]  has HomePods attached to his Apple TV and like when it works it's magical because it's
[53:01.620 --> 53:07.220]  like doing a whole home theater thing with a stereo pair of HomePods but he says it's
[53:07.220 --> 53:11.820]  kind of unreliable and obviously so late in the game that they finally enabled that feature
[53:11.820 --> 53:16.780]  and I wonder if even something like that might have been like oh you know but this is why
[53:16.780 --> 53:20.860]  you get them is that you won't believe how what kind of a sound you get out of your TV
[53:20.860 --> 53:24.860]  when you do this which is why I you know a couple years ago I think I wrote a piece and
[53:24.860 --> 53:30.320]  I keep running it up the flagpole which is I wonder if Apple combined the HomePod with
[53:30.320 --> 53:36.580]  the Apple TV and made like a sound bar kind of thing that sounded great and streamed everything
[53:36.580 --> 53:42.940]  and you put it under your TV set if that would be a more clear clearly defined product that
[53:42.940 --> 53:48.100]  would make people say you know you gotta buy this because it sounds so great but you know
[53:48.100 --> 53:52.820]  that was a that was a sort of unique feature that is in those HomePods now but it's sort
[53:52.820 --> 53:57.740]  of too late for that to be a selling point you know it's far too late I've got I've got
[53:57.740 --> 54:01.540]  two HomePods hooked up to my Apple TV in the living room which is why I don't have any
[54:01.540 --> 54:06.820]  in the kitchen anymore I find it I don't have any reliability issues with it I don't dispute
[54:06.820 --> 54:14.500]  that Mike does but for me it is bulletproof it yeah I've heard it sounds really good it
[54:14.500 --> 54:19.420]  it really sounds good and one of the reasons I had to buy two more is this right now we
[54:19.420 --> 54:23.460]  have I have a black one and a white one because that's the only two I had in the house and
[54:23.460 --> 54:27.260]  I only hooked it up to try it I was like well let me try this new feature with Apple TV
[54:27.260 --> 54:33.380]  and I hooked the two up and it I thought that they sound so much better than the built-in
[54:33.380 --> 54:38.740]  TV speakers that we've been using because I got the TV about a year ago at the beginning
[54:38.740 --> 54:44.100]  and I had plans to buy a whole you know some kind of soundbar thing right figure out something
[54:44.100 --> 54:50.220]  good for the thing but the built-in LG speakers were like good enough that it was like this
[54:50.220 --> 54:54.780]  actually isn't too bad compared to what we're used to and so we sort of went through most
[54:54.780 --> 55:00.860]  of the last year just using those and thinking well once this whole pandemic is over I'll
[55:00.860 --> 55:06.420]  figure this out and have you know somebody come in and hook up soundbar whatever but
[55:06.420 --> 55:11.160]  the two home pods sounds so great but now we watch some stuff on TiVo and the TiVo stuff
[55:11.160 --> 55:15.460]  still has to go through the TV and everything else we go through Apple TV I find the Apple
[55:15.460 --> 55:20.500]  TV stuff sounds so much I'm like this is amazing and my wife is like I don't hear the difference
[55:20.500 --> 55:26.020]  and it's like oh you know that's part that's part of the challenge right is that for a
[55:26.020 --> 55:31.100]  lot of people it's like yeah it's fine right and that's like I find my wife yeah we have
[55:31.100 --> 55:36.580]  a new Echo now and a new Echo Show but we had the original Echo Show for a while which
[55:36.580 --> 55:41.500]  is the sort of one with the screen and I would come out and find my wife cooking dinner or
[55:41.500 --> 55:45.220]  something with music playing on it and like I got the home pods are right over there she's
[55:45.220 --> 55:48.820]  yeah but I'm in the kitchen so I'm listening to this and like right so it sounds terrible
[55:48.820 --> 55:52.660]  and it sounds better now the new one sounds better but like she didn't care it was like
[55:52.660 --> 55:56.580]  it's just music in the background while she's cooking and there's the sound of the you know
[55:56.580 --> 56:01.220]  the hood over the stove and the stuff sizzling in a pan or whatever and it's like she didn't
[56:01.220 --> 56:05.420]  care and I think that that's fundamentally that's one of Apple's challenges with that
[56:05.420 --> 56:10.940]  high-end home pod is like most people I think yeah whatever doesn't doesn't matter well
[56:10.940 --> 56:15.320]  and and then I think it parlays right into a discussion of what the hell is Apple's strategy
[56:15.320 --> 56:19.740]  with Apple TV and you and I have actually written quite a bit about it recently yep
[56:19.740 --> 56:24.940]  and think about it a lot but it ties into it and I you know what exactly is their living
[56:24.940 --> 56:31.620]  room strategy right is maybe a better question you know or or you know they've got the computers
[56:31.620 --> 56:37.140]  in your pants pocket down and the computer at your desk or kitchen counter or wherever
[56:37.140 --> 56:43.980]  you work down it's the what do you use to entertain yourself yeah angle so I have a
[56:43.980 --> 56:50.740]  theory and I want to know what you think of it which is I think maybe culturally Apple
[56:50.740 --> 56:57.580]  has a lot of people at Apple maybe have this roadblock which is but the iPhone is so good
[56:57.580 --> 57:02.480]  but the iPad is so good why would you need something else and I felt like with for the
[57:02.480 --> 57:06.420]  longest time that was their argument about doing a smart speaker was like well why don't
[57:06.420 --> 57:10.380]  you just talk to your phone and I wonder if maybe that gets in the way like they're so
[57:10.380 --> 57:19.900]  focused on the pants pocket that they haven't thought about the the living room as much
[57:19.900 --> 57:23.900]  I don't know if that's I don't know if that's true but I'm trying honestly I am struggling
[57:23.900 --> 57:27.800]  to try to figure out why it is that Apple has completely whiffed on smart home stuff
[57:27.800 --> 57:32.380]  that they have the Apple TV over here they have the HomePod over here they abandoned
[57:32.380 --> 57:36.740]  the Wi-Fi router market at exactly the time where they could have probably made a difference
[57:36.740 --> 57:42.080]  in the Wi-Fi router market right and and HomeKit has been this thing that's also sort of like
[57:42.080 --> 57:46.660]  very amorphous first it was very strict then it was very loose now they're supposedly working
[57:46.660 --> 57:51.540]  on a new standard with their competitors I don't know it's all up in the air but but
[57:51.540 --> 57:57.600]  never has seemed coherent and and it feels like a real missed opportunity the home stuff
[57:57.600 --> 58:03.400]  they seem to be working out right and and I think the what are you what's the what's
[58:03.400 --> 58:10.700]  the phrase for all the stuff HomeKit the HomeKit stuff and the knock against HomeKit was Apple
[58:10.700 --> 58:16.960]  is making anybody who wants to be HomeKit certified go through XYZ a big long laundry
[58:16.960 --> 58:22.060]  list of stuff to comply and it's you know they can say it's for privacy and they could
[58:22.060 --> 58:27.100]  say it's for security and they could say it's for whatever good reasons but Amazon just
[58:27.100 --> 58:31.200]  makes you do like one two three and then you can have a device that talks to Alexa and
[58:31.200 --> 58:38.100]  so of course there's a gazillion things for Alexa and not so many for HomeKit it seems
[58:38.100 --> 58:44.220]  like they've worked that through through pure better through just through pure diligence
[58:44.220 --> 58:49.180]  right that they've taken it seriously have never let their eye off the ball and slowly
[58:49.180 --> 58:53.540]  but surely it's taken a long time but now there are all sorts of things like security
[58:53.540 --> 59:00.740]  cameras and stuff that that HomeKit was didn't have options for or too few I mean they also
[59:00.740 --> 59:05.020]  loosen their restrictions some because they realize that their original rules basically
[59:05.020 --> 59:08.780]  said that if you didn't ship your piece of hardware with HomeKit built into it you could
[59:08.780 --> 59:13.880]  never add it later because they were so strict and they kind of loosen some of that although
[59:13.880 --> 59:19.180]  even there there's some mysterious kind of bad decisions they announced HomeKit secure
[59:19.180 --> 59:24.980]  video but there were sort of no partners and when it did arrive it was buggy and it didn't
[59:24.980 --> 59:29.140]  you know and and you would have to sort of forgo the apps and then just use the home
[59:29.140 --> 59:35.340]  app and I you know it's still it's better you know we talked about my report card thing
[59:35.340 --> 59:40.380]  that I do every year and like I think the HomeKit stuff like it's gotten better people
[59:40.380 --> 59:46.180]  who knock it think back a few years like it's way better than it was it's much more useful
[59:46.180 --> 59:54.900]  but it's been a long slow slog to get to this point and it still feels like you know there
[59:54.900 --> 01:00:00.780]  are so many other competitors out there where you know maybe it is that I just look at it
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:06.580]  and I think Apple could really done something special in here and instead it seems like
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:11.860]  a low priority and that Apple is just trying to work as hard as it can to get to the table
[01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:16.980]  stakes when it could have said oh all of your home stuff is really bad and we're going to
[01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:21.180]  do a better job and they seem to have just said we're not going to do that we're just
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:27.380]  not going to do it yeah and it just seems like they just don't have a good answer for
[01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:31.620]  well okay let's say I want to get into this I want to get into having a smart home and
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:37.580]  have lights that I can turn off with voice commands and and other stuff like that and
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:42.380]  what do I buy what am I supposed to do right how do I do it and and the the I don't think
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:48.060]  they have a good answer for it here's my hope this is where I'm hopeful is that thread radio
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:56.320]  in the HomePod mini that is interesting because that's Apple saying there are lots of devices
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:01.380]  out there that are this is a new standard people are using the thread radio to talk
[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:07.700]  to Internet of Things devices and we have it in the HomePod mini and and for people
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:12.300]  who don't know or people who haven't bought this stuff like so many smart home things
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:17.140]  you buy there's also like this white plastic blob that you have to plug into your network
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:21.500]  or plug into a wall somewhere in order to get it to work and the idea of the thread
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:27.740]  radio is you buy these things and that little blob was a you know was a thread radio or
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:32.460]  it was a competitor to the thread standard it was you know the hue bulb radio or the
[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:38.300]  lutron casita smart switch radio I have those two I have in my house right and they're great
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:42.180]  but you've got this little white plastic box that you got to plug into power and plug into
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:47.820]  Ethernet and the thread radio like that's Apple sort of saying okay thread is a thing
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:53.860]  we are going to support it and if you buy an object that uses thread you don't have
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:02:00.980]  to buy that box it's not necessary it it will go on this and it will work and that makes
[01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:08.420]  me think oh maybe they do have a vision for what the home is and they're just only now
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:13.660]  starting to roll out what it's going to be so if I if I I'm not sure I'm that optimistic
[01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:19.860]  but if I was going to give you the the the bullish case for HomePod or for for Apple
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:24.860]  in the home in general that's probably what I'd have to hang my hat on is the fact that
[01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:28.580]  they they shipped a thread radio and that thing and kind of made a big deal out of it
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:32.940]  because that's Apple saying we are going to play well with all of these other objects
[01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:37.700]  and we want to make it easy right because you don't want to have to buy those boxes
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:43.500]  and position them somewhere where you can get wired internet or wired Ethernet and is
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:48.060]  close enough for that like it's what a mess right for them to say no you just put a HomePod
[01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:51.860]  out wouldn't it be great if they could do that for Wi-Fi too right put a HomePod out
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:55.380]  and not only is it a speaker and not only is it Siri but it's going to extend your Wi-Fi
[01:02:55.380 --> 01:03:02.100]  I haven't done that yet that would be fantastic but again they're out and the other the other
[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:08.180]  crazy part of the getting out of the Wi-Fi router business is the in addition to the
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:13.620]  just having the smart home when you're in the home is the how can you securely contact
[01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:18.620]  your home when you're out of the home right and the router is the point that's the point
[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:25.500]  where you would want to have this thing that you could trust trust from the outside and
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:30.820]  actually knows how to integrate with all the stuff on the inside exactly and and you could
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:37.420]  also argue that the the Wi-Fi router home router thing is could have been part of Apple's
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:42.780]  security and privacy argument right like they could have said we are the ones who are gonna
[01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:47.700]  gonna control what's going on in your home like Eero now has this setting where they
[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:53.740]  will wall off all of your internet smart home things on a separate network that doesn't
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:57.380]  see your network so that if they get hacked right they don't see the rest of your network
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:01.740]  and like but Apple could have led there and potentially even offered like VPNs and things
[01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:07.020]  like that as add-ons and and and and said we're gonna protect your home network it's
[01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:12.220]  gonna be us and you trust us and you know instead I get why they got out of the router
[01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:15.280]  business I think they felt like it was just a commodity business and they had nothing
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:20.420]  to contribute it's just unfortunate that like a year or two later it became clear that there
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:24.320]  was this whole new wave of technology that was coming that they could have contributed
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:29.340]  to and they missed the boat it's like when they got out of the printer business I mean
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:34.020]  not not to go too far back down memory lane but they had great printers laser writers
[01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:42.540]  laser writers were fantastic laser printers and the quality of the laser writer experience
[01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:52.100]  helped force HP to compete I remember it like being at the Drexel newspaper 25 years ago
[01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:58.180]  and we wound up spending a lot of money on a great high-end HP laser printer but it was
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:06.740]  great by the standards of laser writers you know but I totally it the Apple getting out
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:16.380]  of the printer business makes it was regrettable but it makes sense without the big but with
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:20.500]  the getting out of the Wi-Fi business where it's like I get it where it's similar to printers
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:27.920]  where their commodities but this whole privacy thing and security thing is like your message
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:33.740]  of the moment right whereas the printer thing that there was no thing like that it was just
[01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:38.660]  they just worked a little better and it would have been the perfect tie-in to a smart home
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:43.820]  story for them right to be at the center of your network spreading it throughout your
[01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:50.540]  house and yeah that was that was short-sighted but you know they there's something there's
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:55.000]  a story to be told at some point of the middle of the 2010s decade and decisions Apple made
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.600]  because there are a lot of interesting decisions that went in there because I'll throw onto
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:04.480]  the pile the we're out of the display business statement that they made which like Neelay
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:10.900]  Patel heard and I was there that was in the piano bar across the hallway from town hall
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:14.780]  and you know they they basically said now we're not going to do we're not going to do
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:18.000]  displays anymore we're out of the display business and of course that wasn't true either
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.140]  they were out of the Mac Pro business basically they came back out of the display business
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:28.740]  they came back and you know whether they come back into doing mesh networking or or or whatever
[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:32.500]  like clearly they decided they were out of that business and that I would argue that
[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:36.820]  was a huge mistake on their part too Apple doesn't need to be in every business but some
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:40.000]  of these things are core to their business and core to their customers technological
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.980]  lives and the the Wi-Fi thing not to harp on it too much but like Apple literally seeded
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:49.740]  everybody's home networks to cable companies and failing that Google and Amazon yeah just
[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:54.540]  seems like or or you buy one of these Netgear things that first off is easily hacked I'm
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:58.140]  sorry Netgear but like you hear stories about those things getting hacked and they look
[01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:04.300]  like they got like four antennas sticking out of them and stuff and they look horrible
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:06.900]  and then you look at something like Eero and you're like oh well that's what Apple would
[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:12.740]  have designed but Apple decided they weren't gonna bother
[01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:19.020]  admin admin I just bought I bought it I bought a Dymo label printer for like a hundred bucks
[01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:26.100]  and the way you set it up is you hold a button and it creates its own Wi-Fi network temporarily
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:31.620]  and and the instructions say and then log in with username admin password admin and
[01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:36.020]  then you can set it up and tell it how to get on your real Wi-Fi network and then it'll
[01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:40.740]  shut off its own Wi-Fi network and it's like it's not that insecure I guess but why even
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:46.580]  have the admin admin thing if it's just a temporary Wi-Fi network that you connect you
[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:51.940]  know what I mean it's like I don't know whatever thinking you had but there's some line of
[01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:57.700]  thought that some engineers have that well we'll just give admin admin as the username
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:04.500]  and password and you know then you wind up with Netgear routers getting hacked for 30
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:08.560]  years anyway yeah let me take a break thank our next sponsor our good friends at flat

[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:46.420]  that url very simple flat file dot io my thanks to flat file for sponsoring this show intel
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:50.540]  had some new ads this week i don't want to talk about them too much i wrote about a lot
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:10:00.780]  about them justin long they got the they got the mac and i'm a mac to pitch intel ads uh
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:04.200]  i always feel like if i write enough about something i should talk about it when i do
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:08.220]  a podcast but on the other hand it's like me having written about it well i don't have
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:17.660]  much more to add it just it's i hate i hate to watch something that makes me cringe yep
[01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:21.080]  and i was thinking about i just saw it right when i was watching i mentioned it out so
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:28.460]  i watched drexel illinois before we recorded today there was a microsoft surface ad during
[01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:34.560]  the basketball game and um there's like a young black teenager who is there telling
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:41.100]  you about the microsoft surface and the macbook next to him and telling you that he likes
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:47.940]  the surface because it's detachable and it has a touch screen and the macbook just has
[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:53.980]  this weird touch bar why do they do that and it doesn't detach and look at the price 1300
[01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:59.460]  for the macbook versus 900 for the surface and it plays games better and a commercial
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:04.860]  that's a that's a fine ad touting you know what's great about the surface the kid was
[01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:12.340]  great he's perfect spokesperson uh nothing cringe-worthy at all you know it it it's like
[01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:16.780]  some of the pushback i get from people like on twitter is you know that if somebody who
[01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:25.860]  writes a generally uh in you know likes apple products sort of site like daring fireball
[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:30.000]  takes issue with an intel ad it's like some kind of knee-jerk reaction and it's like no
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.860]  not really it's these are just bad ads and they're sort of embarrassing yeah there's
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:41.380]  a you remember i mean back in the in the bad old days um every now and then you get you
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:47.480]  see apple get hit with a uh a negative ad from somebody and and as a as a user of apple
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:54.060]  products you're like ouch you know it that stings this is not that kind of ad these these
[01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:58.700]  ads are like what are you doing like intel what are you doing like first off why are
[01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:04.740]  you spending your money on this second you've got problems already in your own space with
[01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:11.480]  more uh arm products running windows and with your competition out gunning you on the high
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:18.860]  end especially and uh also like nothing that you say was not true when apple was making
[01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:26.100]  intel max so it's not actually about intel processors at all it's it's more like uh we
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:31.780]  just broke up and now i'm angry so i'm gonna i'm gonna throw some shade at you um even
[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:37.860]  though it's sort of like it it's it's just kind of sad and it and it misses the point
[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:41.720]  like that's that's the problem i have with it is that it's not really extolling the virtues
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:47.940]  of intel even like it's extolling the virtues of windows the windows pc ecosystem even though
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:53.060]  some of those windows pcs are also not running intel processors it's i don't know it's just
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:59.060]  like intel's got so many problems right now and having apple break up with it seems so
[01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:04.460]  low on the list that they would do a whole sort of spite campaign and yeah it doesn't
[01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:11.420]  really sting like there are there are way better ways to advocate for uh what's going
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:17.500]  on in the pc market and the intel ads just sort of seem sad i don't know there's a there's
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:23.220]  a part of me that wants to say that the bigger problem with apple silicon max this the first
[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:30.180]  round and the first reaction and the first you know put them in real world reviewers
[01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:35.540]  hands give them to real people selling real people have people issue their feedback and
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:40.580]  the resounding wow these things are really fast the system runs better the battery life
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:46.340]  is truly you know almost twice what it was on intel versions they were just selling a
[01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:55.060]  few months ago isn't that intel is losing the business of selling chips to apple for
[01:13:55.060 --> 01:14:00.800]  four to five million max per quarter which is you know it is a loss but it's not that
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:07.020]  devastating it's that it's opened the eyes to the world at large to how far far behind
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:15.960]  the intel platform has fallen yeah because we have these arm tablets running android
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:23.860]  and ios ipad os and if everybody has phones running android and ios and we see these you
[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:29.020]  know wow this seems so much better and performing and it's felt like you know you can look at
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:34.940]  geekbench numbers and say wow it really you know this is actually faster than a macbook
[01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:39.700]  it seems like they could run a macbook on this but because the whole windows on arm
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:45.140]  thing and i know it exists but it's never it just doesn't have they didn't solve all
[01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:52.720]  the compatibility issues in the way that apple did with mac os where there's very little
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:15:00.100]  that doesn't run on a mac an m1 macbook or and even when you when it runs not natively
[01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:05.460]  when you're running the stuff through rosetta 2 for the most part it's actually faster than
[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:12.740]  having run it on a recent intel macbook that's how fast these are and how good rosetta is
[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:19.960]  windows doesn't have that sort of you won't even notice story almost anybody who's it
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:24.500]  very few people who aren't true computer experts are ever going to run into anything with an
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:28.820]  apple silicon mac where it's incompatible with something it's something that just doesn't
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:36.740]  run that they expect to run it that's not true on windows and so therefore and also
[01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:44.740]  the arm chips that they have shipped with certain windows running on arm products aren't
[01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:51.300]  great arm chips period so it's our it's the world's first look at a pc class operating
[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:58.460]  system running on good competes with the high end of any chips period arm chips and it's
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:04.780]  like wow that whole intel platform is behind it's just that's to me is the reaction like
[01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:10.660]  the the world's reaction to it and intel's if this is their response marketing wise it's
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:16.300]  like you you don't even realize it yeah that's that's the thing that's disturbing about it
[01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:21.300]  i would say is that the the ceo saying we're behind to his employees behind closed doors
[01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:27.380]  being like we got to catch up we got to work on this that makes sense the um you know first
[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:33.380]  off intel doesn't okay intel doesn't sell products that's also part of this right like
[01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:37.600]  intel doesn't sell products you don't go out and say give me an intel that you you buy
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:44.220]  a pc and so they're basically doing the heavy lifting for i guess microsoft but again a
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:49.140]  lot of the exciting stuff that's happening in the pc market is not running on intel processors
[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:53.660]  and i don't know is it just a smokescreen because they're so embarrassed by the the
[01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:59.060]  m1 max i don't know it just seems it's it's just sad and i i don't i would like to see
[01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:04.980]  intel intel is one of the great companies in the technology industry they've lost their
[01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:08.860]  way i would love to see them find their way i would love a story where they decide they're
[01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:12.980]  going to fab other people's chips and at some point down the road apple comes back to them
[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:17.120]  right and says we want to make some of our chips here in america and we're going to and
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:20.960]  you know we're using tsmc over here but we're going to use intel for this chip now i would
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:26.600]  love to see that but they need to look within themselves for that to happen i don't want
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:32.300]  them to fail but whatever they're doing you know now is not working and this these ads
[01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:39.660]  don't just why why why waste your money i really i would really like to think that justin
[01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:45.860]  long it really is making a lot of money from this because otherwise i'm worried that he
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:50.480]  needs work or something you know working actor i don't blame him i don't blame him they're
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:58.240]  paying him well i don't blame him you know it's and he does the best with some bad material
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:03.100]  in my opinion he is a very likable fellow i i do think that somebody raised this and
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:11.180]  i i didn't really think of it but i did you know if he intends to do commercials as part
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:16.380]  of his acting career going forward what does it mean though that if you clearly have exhibited
[01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:22.780]  the fact that you might go to the competitor and do an ad that you know you know what i
[01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:30.580]  mean like does it reduce his higher ability to sell coke later on if coke has to then
[01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:35.980]  worry that as soon as his contract is up he's going to go to pepsi and and talk about how
[01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:41.420]  coke rots your teeth out or something i don't know i mean that seems to happen so infrequently
[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:45.280]  but at the same time justin long at this point is recognizable enough that he's he's going
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:50.640]  to be hired because people want a oh it's that guy kind of approach to their to their
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:57.440]  ad you know he's he's i i would defer to a an expert on commercial casting and things
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:03.520]  like that but it strikes me that he's kind of in this uncanny valley now where he's too
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:11.420]  recognizable to be an anonymous actor in an ad but um not recognizable enough to be a
[01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:16.280]  celebrity endorser right he's not matthew mcconaughey you know picking his picking his
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:20.660]  nose driving a lincoln down the highway you know and this is a celebrity endorsement ad
[01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:25.840]  because he was in those apple ads so it's the rare it may be that it's the rare case
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:30.620]  where he can get a commercial job because most commercial people are going to be like
[01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:35.660]  well why would i pay there is everybody's going to focus on that it's justin long from
[01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:40.380]  you know those apple ads and galaxy quest and ed right like he's in that diehard movie
[01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:44.700]  right like oh it's that guy and that's not what you want in a lot of commercial casting
[01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:50.220]  right so i don't know i don't know i'm glad he got paid he is a he's a likable actor who's
[01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:55.740]  been in a lot of stuff that i've liked and uh i'm glad he got paid but uh yeah it's sad
[01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:59.740]  yeah and it just comes down to the you know you mentioned it the intel isn't really selling
[01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:05.660]  a product and like the original intel inside campaign with the dun dun dun dun dun you
[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:09.180]  know the little jingle that none of us will ever forget for the rest of our lives there
[01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:13.260]  there was a point to it i don't know that it was money well spent but i don't think
[01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:18.540]  it was money wasted where you know whatever you think of competitors like amd there was
[01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:25.580]  something to be established for intel saying look if your pc doesn't have this badge on
[01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:29.900]  it that's right literally stuck on it it's a second it's a second-rate computer this
[01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:35.980]  is the best intel's the best for the sticker it's a symbol of quality right don't get a
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:41.100]  right which may or may not have been true arguable right in the in the mid-2000s but
[01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:45.420]  it was a great ad campaign because it was basically like pcs that don't have the intel
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:51.980]  label on them are like uh crab with a k yeah you know buy some crab artificial crab meat
[01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:57.340]  at the store well it's it smells like a crab uh you're like don't get it it's bad it's
[01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:01.420]  bad don't get the fake stuff get the real stuff like that i think that was very effective
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:06.540]  and also very smart on their part because if i were their competitor trying to make pcs
[01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:11.660]  with my chips in them i'd be like oh intel like you're making you're devaluing us and
[01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:15.340]  that was that was a a brilliant campaign and that's why there are all those stickers by
[01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:19.020]  the way which is why there was that guy in 2007 who was like will you put stickers on
[01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:26.140]  your max that are running intel and steve jobs is like no no it was better i just re-watched
[01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:32.060]  it he was they laughed shiller laughed a little but shiller realized it's a tough question and
[01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:37.820]  he looks and he and he looks at jobs and jobs is clearly you could see it on chiller's face
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:42.060]  where he's like ah steve's gonna handle this thank god and he's like well what can i say
[01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:49.340]  we like our own stickers better and that's the perfect answer everybody laughed it didn't make
[01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:53.740]  a jerk out of the questioner and it didn't throw intel into the bus by saying we're not going to
[01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:59.020]  put their ugly stickers on our beautiful max back in 2007 i deconstructed this entire thing because
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:03.660]  of you by the way because of you yeah because jobs says don't get me wrong we love working
[01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:07.660]  with intel we're proud to ship intel products and max they're screamers you know we'd rather
[01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:11.500]  not tell them about the product that's inside the box everyone knows we use intel processors
[01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:18.140]  and then you said uh will someone please tell me who asked this question so i can name him jackass
[01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:23.740]  of the week it's like a rare public q and a with steve jobs and someone asks why they won't booger
[01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:27.660]  up their computers with horrid stickers and the answer is it's a guy named bob keefe who worked
[01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:35.340]  at cox newspapers and uh you know he was very good-natured when i when i called him out about
[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:42.940]  i was like it's that guy but um but yeah he was just like i'm a business reporter i was asking a
[01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:47.740]  question like he just didn't he didn't like even get what it was about and it turns out he was
[01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:52.300]  actually writing a story about the intel inside marketing program so he was really hijacking the
[01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:58.060]  whole pr campaign or the whole press conference so that he could write his he could get a question
[01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:03.980]  for his story which is a classic uh kind of bad reporter technique i would say early rude reporter
[01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:10.380]  technique where it's like forget about all this stuff give me a quote for my story steve uh but
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:15.260]  it was uh that was a it was quite a moment and people really thought like is intel gonna make
[01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:20.460]  them put stickers on there it's like steve jobs is never gonna do it he's never gonna do it right
[01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:25.740]  it was one of the not even on the box right it's just not there's no intel logo anywhere not
[01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:31.580]  interested right and who i wouldn't be surprised if apple truly paid more per processor because
[01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:35.420]  i'm sure intel was like okay you don't want to put stickers on you don't have to put stickers on but
[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:40.860]  if you do put the stickers on we will cut five percent off yeah my understanding is there was
[01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:44.460]  like also like marketing money where they like give you money for your commercials if you put
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:49.660]  the little animation of the intel logo and apple is not interested the the line by the way this
[01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:55.900]  is maybe the best line uh from the whole thing which is at the end steve says we put ourselves
[01:23:55.900 --> 01:24:00.060]  in the customer's shoes and we say what do we want stuck in our product when we take it out
[01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:07.580]  of the box and the answer is nothing where did you write about this was this at macworld it was at
[01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:11.980]  macworld i put a link in our little notes you can put in the show notes that story's still up there
[01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:15.980]  which is great they just changed their cms over at macworld and i'm glad all my all my stories
[01:24:15.980 --> 01:24:22.380]  i've written in the last 20 years are still there that was from 2007 good times i you know i regret
[01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:28.940]  see that's the i i regret it to some degree but it also is the difference between where daring
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:34.220]  for our ball is today in 2007 i would never consider calling somebody like that who if we
[01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:40.700]  got a q a with you know tim cook and and jaws and whoever else i would never consider calling them
[01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:47.260]  jackass it's just daring fireballs too prominent and i i've cringe a little bit that i did then
[01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:53.100]  but also in 2007 during fireball was read by people only by people who uh
[01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:59.740]  knew exactly what i was talking about like hey we only have so much time with these guys don't
[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:06.780]  ask a bad question but it's not the worst question either um yeah and and my piece that that we can
[01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:11.180]  link to basically says although i wouldn't have asked this question and i think it was kind of
[01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:17.740]  a dumb reason to ask it it did get very interesting things from steve jobs and phil shiller about their
[01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:24.060]  product marketing right you know philosophy and like it's really actually quite good and
[01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:27.980]  that last line about like what do we want if we were a customer what do we want stuck on our
[01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:33.500]  product the answer is nothing it's like yeah exactly so it was in the end i think it was worth
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:37.980]  what we got out of it but it was a moment where everybody's like who who asked that question the
[01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:44.540]  answer is it's some guy from the austin american statesman who it was working on a story it's chill
[01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:51.020]  chill everybody it's fine it they don't like to explain themselves i always think of the the line
[01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:58.220]  from uh there will be blood where the daniel dale lewis protagonist at one point just says i i don't
[01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:05.660]  like to explain myself and that sort of is sort of the theme of the whole movie um but apple does
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:10.700]  not like to explain itself in most cases and it was interesting just to hear them actually you
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:17.580]  know the the lack of stickers on the palm rest of of a macbook or a powerbook or an iBook or any
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:23.580]  of the laptops they've ever made speaks for itself mostly but then to have them actually talk about
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:29.660]  it actually is kind of interesting yeah yeah and in the jobs era especially i think steve jobs
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:33.740]  really liked the idea that apple was a black box and you just couldn't understand what magic things
[01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:38.140]  came out of it and that was it and you didn't we're never going to explain our magic tricks
[01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:44.700]  right no good magician explains their tricks i honestly feel i i feel like in some ways it was
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:50.940]  more of a magic trick mindset with steve jobs in that era but at that in other ways apple today
[01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:58.060]  is even less communicative about the why of what they do and it's almost like now it's like
[01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:04.220]  institutionalized it's like cultural as opposed to strategic sure well i think i think steve when
[01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:10.700]  he wrote the book on what apple's culture was going to be when he came back to apple um a lot
[01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:15.980]  of stuff that steve believed became part of that culture i don't think necessarily all of it was
[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:21.100]  good i think in the bulk it was good but i think lots of quirks of his personality made it in there
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:25.100]  and that some of that stuff is getting unwound i think that after steve passed away and katie
[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:32.540]  cotton left apple and and then and now you know steve dowling has left apple as well like we we're
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:38.860]  a couple generations of new apple approach to public communication and uh you see it like your
[01:27:38.860 --> 01:27:45.980]  talk show interviews at wwc hope we get those again someday uh in person but like and the podcast
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:52.060]  interviews they do now honestly for a bunch of us podcasters apple is one comfortable with people
[01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:59.420]  who are not high level executives talking about products in detail and two i would say more open
[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:07.420]  not wide open they're all very well trained but more open about um some of the thought processes
[01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:13.900]  about a product like i said they're well trained but like there's a little more i feel like there
[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:19.260]  that they're willing to share it's very clearly what they're willing to share but there is i feel
[01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:23.980]  like there's more there when we went like a couple years ago we went to uh we were in the same
[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:28.460]  briefing i think or at least on the same day in new york city and you know phil shiller is there
[01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:35.260]  and he's talking about the 16-inch macbook pro and you know i didn't think i just got a product litany
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:41.820]  from phil shiller i feel like i got some philosophy about the product and what they were going for
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:46.940]  that was maybe a little bit more than they would have um let out of the box before they still
[01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:51.260]  weren't going to talk about the butterfly keyboard right right but you could you got a little bit
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:56.780]  more so i think they've they've tweaked it and i've experimented with that and uh and we get more
[01:28:56.780 --> 01:29:03.100]  out of them out of the black box than we used to but make no mistake it's all intentional yeah
[01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:08.460]  yeah definitely uh all right let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor it's our good

[01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:21.820]  to the i got the box in my hand i don't have the box anymore i i think i was on the side
[01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:28.700]  core technologies aqua mm-hmm is that a technology darwin quartz with pdf imaging
[01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:37.420]  open gl3d quicktime 5 classic carbon and cocoa they are on one line java 2 standard edition

[01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:57.740]  the list goes on and there's a little flap on the front that that has like uh introducing mac os 10
[01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:02.540]  the super modern operating system that delivers the power of unix with the legendary simplicity
[01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:11.180]  and elegance of the macintosh uh yeah 20 years since they shipped the boxed copy of 10.0
[01:33:11.180 --> 01:33:19.900]  it's muddy right because in the fall of 2000 they shipped the public beta and in the fall of 2001
[01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:26.380]  they shipped 10.1 which i would argue is sort of the first usable version of 10 and we're kind of
[01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:31.900]  in the middle of these three anniversaries but it is the you know 10.0 shipped date is is now
[01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:37.340]  20 years ago uh here's their description from the press release mac os 10 slightly different
[01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:41.260]  it's slightly different than the boxed copies macos 10 is the world's most advanced operating
[01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:47.340]  system combining combining the power and openness of unix spelled with all caps with the legendary
[01:33:47.340 --> 01:33:55.020]  ease and use and broad applications base of macintosh and the quote in the pr from steve
[01:33:55.020 --> 01:34:01.820]  jobs apple's ceo macos 10 is the most important software from apple since the original macintosh
[01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:07.900]  operating system in 1984 that revenue revolutionized the entire industry we can't wait for
[01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:15.660]  mac users around the globe to experience its stability power and elegance so he didn't mention
[01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:24.860]  its speed stability power and elegance and that's my memory of 10.1 right when i wrote the 10.1
[01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:30.140]  because i looked it up i edited our big feature about the public beta at macworld back in the day
[01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:35.500]  and then from that point on i wrote the review basically the feature of every release since then
[01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:41.900]  i have very fond memories i've i've lived in my house about as long as os 10 era i we bought this
[01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:47.980]  house in 1999 and and over the years every summer i end up sitting in my backyard under the redwood
[01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:54.780]  tree writing about os 10 releases like every for 20 years now i've been doing that it's it keeps
[01:34:54.780 --> 01:35:02.140]  happening um but 10.1 you talk about the speed and that was my real clearest memory of the early days
[01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:09.580]  is we got to the 10.1 beta releases and it was literally like oh i can use this like i could
[01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:14.300]  stay booted into this because the public beta and even 10.0 it was more like you booted in
[01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:18.940]  there and then you're like oh okay uh now i'm gonna get some real work done i'm gonna restart
[01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:26.540]  back into os9 okay let's get out of here it was slow i mean i i so slow i think 10.1 definitely
[01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:32.220]  improved it i still think 10.1 was too slow it was not it it was not great but it was usable
[01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:37.180]  like you could you could use it and i think i started using os 10 full-time with 10.1 yeah
[01:35:37.180 --> 01:35:42.700]  and in this era there was the g3s and the g4s and really that you needed to have a g4 for it to
[01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:53.180]  really feel comfortable yeah i had i forget the exact model but i had i had a powerbook g3
[01:35:54.060 --> 01:35:59.340]  because i went when it shipped the 20 year ago this weekend i was still working full-time at
[01:35:59.340 --> 01:36:06.700]  barebone software um makers of bb edit yeah and i i i i guess i it was like my work laptop and i
[01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:13.260]  think i when i left the job i got it as a parting gift or something but i had a powerbook g3 that i
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:23.340]  ran mac os 10 on full-time and my home computer was a power mac 9600 350 that i'd bought in 97
[01:36:23.340 --> 01:36:30.140]  or 98 and never was able to run mac os 10 on because the they they originally said you know
[01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:34.860]  this would qualify and then as the years went on they moved the cutoff date to like g3 or later
[01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:40.300]  which was fair and i don't think i would have installed on it anyway but i had a powerbook g3
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:50.060]  that always ran os 10 and i had my power my 9600 that ran mac os 9 and it was a slower computer
[01:36:50.060 --> 01:36:55.660]  because it was older even though it was a fancy pants you know big ass mac power mac from from
[01:36:55.660 --> 01:37:01.260]  then but it was at this point you know four or five years old it was always startling how much
[01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:08.060]  faster everything felt going back to it just like stunning like oh my god i i could just like go
[01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:14.300]  through i i just go through emails down down down loads an email loads an email i hit new and the
[01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:20.460]  window opens immediately and i can start typing it's a you know it was a weird thing you know it
[01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:29.100]  just did you know it it worked out and i'm not even saying it was a mistake it's sort of you
[01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:36.620]  know but it worked out partially because they you know maybe they had to maybe they didn't want to
[01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:44.140]  but they you know they kept mac os 9 going for a few more years until they had the the ceremonial
[01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:53.020]  coffin funeral funeral for os 9 right yeah the truth is that the os 10 transition was a multi-year
[01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:57.580]  transition and not just like from when they announced that steve jobs was coming back in
[01:37:57.580 --> 01:38:02.460]  january 97 and he was bringing next step with him and that was going to be the foundation of
[01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:08.540]  mac os 10 which was like that's the starting gun right it's january of 97 but the truth is that
[01:38:08.540 --> 01:38:13.820]  even when they shipped the public beta in the fall of 2000 even when they shipped 10.0 in the
[01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:20.220]  spring of 2001 and even when they shipped 10.1 in the fall of 2001 they weren't really done even
[01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:25.900]  then it was many years like you could really argue that the public beta and 10.0 and 10.1
[01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:33.580]  were more for developers right to get all the software over and to prove that there was momentum
[01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:38.620]  there to the user and i think honestly part of apple strategy all along was not that they were
[01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:43.420]  going to make os 10 more efficient although they did like it got more efficient over time
[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:48.620]  it definitely ran faster over time but and keeping in mind that they had to build like
[01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:52.940]  all these features the compatibility features with the mac like it was a enormous undertaking
[01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:59.260]  but they also knew that their chips were getting faster right and that was the other part of it
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:06.140]  like if we wait this out eventually this was going to be usable and we got there but it took like
[01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:14.700]  what is that like 97 all of 98 all of 99 all of 2000 and probably even if 10.1 is the finish line
[01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:23.100]  that's almost five years all right it's a long time i mean it it you know felt like a long time
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:27.660]  as it went along it feels like a long time in hindsight it feels like it would be a long time
[01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:33.100]  if apple announced some new product now pre-announced and you know said it'll be here
[01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:37.980]  in two or three years and it winds up taking five we would think well that that's long right
[01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:43.980]  but it also didn't feel it never felt like a failure right because even along in the early
[01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:47.580]  years when they didn't even have a beta to show yet it's like well this is obviously big enough
[01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:52.380]  that taking at least two to three years is reasonable and then they had stuff to show
[01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:58.140]  along the way you know they had the the mac os 10 server release that still looked like mac os 9 and
[01:39:58.140 --> 01:40:07.100]  used the platinum interface um it and i think that that that is still part of apple's engineering
[01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:11.020]  and product development culture which is that you've got to make something that you're willing
[01:40:11.020 --> 01:40:17.020]  to put out in the world and say this is real you know you can't just idly work there for years
[01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:24.220]  because that's that is a how apple got into the mess that it was in in the 90s where they kept
[01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:30.300]  announcing these big new bold operating system initiatives and we'll just go off and work on
[01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:35.820]  them and we'll work on this one and in partnership with ibm and right you know halogen and then there
[01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:39.660]  was and then there was copeland which never shipped which was their thing that they talked
[01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:44.860]  about for a long time and they even had a sequel the copeland even had a sequel already planned
[01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:51.420]  gershwin yeah gershwin they already had a sequel they they had a major operating system release
[01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:55.820]  called copeland that they never shipped honestly the sequel was literally the stuff that they
[01:40:55.820 --> 01:40:59.580]  they originally promised for copeland and realized they couldn't deliver before they realized they
[01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:03.340]  couldn't deliver any of it so they're like we'll do that later and i was like no i think you're
[01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:09.740]  never going to do any of this but that was part of the bargaining stage um yeah i think uh it was
[01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:13.740]  never a doubt in my mind that this was the future right i i think that they made it apple made it
[01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:18.380]  clear this is one of the ways that apple is so much different from microsoft i would say in a
[01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:22.380]  better way but certainly in a different way is that it was clear that this is where they were
[01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:27.180]  going and even if the customers said we don't want to go it's too bad they're going to have to
[01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:33.660]  go there honestly also oh the classic mac os was so outmoded at that point no memory protection no
[01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:37.580]  you know full multitasking none of that stuff was in there and it was never going to be in there
[01:41:37.580 --> 01:41:41.420]  that it was sort of like either this would work or apple was going to die the mac was going to die
[01:41:41.420 --> 01:41:46.620]  because there's no way that classic mac os was going to survive for any longer already should
[01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:53.580]  have been replaced right by copeland years before so it was way past time that it got replaced and
[01:41:53.580 --> 01:41:58.060]  then apple had the guts to back that up too so after demonstrating that they were serious about
[01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:05.340]  this os 10 server public beta 10 0 10 1 there also came that moment where they said no new macs are
[01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:10.380]  going to ship that run os 9 that's it right and it's like you want to buy a new mac you're going
[01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:16.300]  to run os 10 it's over and they again five year span and at least a couple of years where they're
[01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:22.940]  actively publicly releasing os 10 but at some point it had it was either going to work or or
[01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:26.700]  that was going to be the end of the mac there was no there was no fallback anymore because
[01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:29.500]  all the fallbacks had failed so this was what they were left with
[01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:38.140]  i want to continue with this but i have a fourth bonus sponsor to thank and it's our good friends
[01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:45.180]  at mac weldon after taking a brief hiatus from outdoor activities and routine workouts it's time
[01:42:45.180 --> 01:42:50.940]  to get back to the grind with the new spring essentials from mac weldon with body mapping
[01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:57.980]  technology and fabric mesh zones mac weldon stealth boxer briefs deliver enhanced breathability
[01:42:57.980 --> 01:43:02.620]  and support i actually bought a couple of these in anticipation of this sponsorship paid for them
[01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:08.060]  there wasn't even freebies that they mailed to me uh very comfortable very nice perfect for everyday
[01:43:08.060 --> 01:43:14.700]  wear or to be layered underneath workout gear and for sweatpants you can wear outside without feeling
[01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:21.020]  like you're wearing sweatpants check out mac weldon's new ace line now when john syracusea
[01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:27.660]  was on the show an episode ago i told him i ordered a pair of those i'm not a sweatpants guy
[01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:32.540]  and he and he thought i was an animal i went through this whole pandemic wearing jeans every
[01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:38.700]  day got a pair of these sweatpants have to say pretty comfortable they're nice pretty pretty
[01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:45.580]  comfortable also very nice pockets very very nice pockets which is very important got to say and
[01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:50.380]  they they do they do kind of feel not so sweat panty i have i've actually left the house gone
[01:43:50.380 --> 01:43:55.580]  shopping ran some errands wearing these things very nice very comfortable they look nice they
[01:43:55.580 --> 01:44:00.300]  don't make you look like you just rolled out of bed uh really great all sorts of other stuff mac
[01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:04.940]  well themselves they got the men's essentials socks shirts hoodies undershirts all that sort
[01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:11.420]  of thing uh polos stuff that you can wear as we enter the world and go back out and and see people
[01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:17.260]  other than the people we live at live with i really love their stuff now weld and blue this
[01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:22.220]  is great they have a loyalty program you sign up you don't have to do anything except sign up level
[01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:27.740]  one once you buy some stuff it gets you free shipping for life once you reach level two and
[01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:33.580]  level two all you have to do is spend a grand total of 200 bucks level two after that you get
[01:44:33.580 --> 01:44:40.940]  20 off every order for the next year just you're just in spend 200 bucks you've already got the
[01:44:40.940 --> 01:44:46.620]  free shipping for life from reaching level one now for the next year everything you buy 20 off
[01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:50.780]  they have a guarantee mac weldon wants you to be comfortable so if you don't like your first pair
[01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:55.340]  of underwear or you can keep them they don't want you to mail back the underwear that you didn't

[01:44:59.820 --> 01:45:11.180]  so you can get 20 off your first order by going to mack weldon m-a-c-k weldon w-e-l-d-o-n dot
[01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:17.820]  com slash talk show and that just use that same promo code talk show that's mack weldon dot com
[01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:25.580]  slash talk show promo code talk show for 20 off your first order my thanks to them all right i
[01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:35.740]  would like to read some some more bullet points from the original mac os 10 pr okay dynamic
[01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:40.540]  memory management eliminating out of memory messages or needing to adjust the memory for
[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:49.740]  applications oh man get info this for those who never use the classic mac os was a clear
[01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:56.140]  a clear down you and i are proponents of it i loved it i still used it primarily for years
[01:45:56.140 --> 01:46:02.140]  after mac os 10 shipped the memory management story was always a problem horrible and if you
[01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:09.100]  cared about the mac for the reasons i did because of the elegance of the user experience this was
[01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:15.180]  crazy if if dos was in windows were the one that worked like this we would have merciless we would
[01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:22.620]  have been merciless about it yep you used to you would get info this is one one thing all mac users
[01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:28.060]  knew how to do then was get info because what you do is you have an application you would get info
[01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:34.540]  and at the bottom there was like uh suggested memory there were two and there were two fields
[01:46:34.540 --> 01:46:41.020]  for some reason right like the maximum memory and the minimum memory and you could change how many
[01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:46.620]  kilobytes of memory the application would get when it launched and then when you'd launch the
[01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:53.820]  application if you just let's say you gave it an even one megabyte it would get one megabyte of ram
[01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:59.260]  and that's all it got and that's all it would ever get and then it would have to do everything it
[01:46:59.260 --> 01:47:06.460]  wanted to do with that allocation of memory if it wasn't using all of it and some other application
[01:47:06.460 --> 01:47:10.220]  needed more well tough luck because that application's running it's already gotten it
[01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:15.660]  and if it needed more you would get an out of memory error usually and then it would tell you
[01:47:15.660 --> 01:47:24.060]  it would suggest quit get info try giving this application more memory and then try again and
[01:47:24.060 --> 01:47:33.660]  how much more memory take a guess not really the mac experience that you would think and certainly
[01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:40.780]  by by the year 2001 seemed a little antiquated but that was actually a selling point to existing
[01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:49.100]  mac users and so you would do the voodoo of like oh my app isn't working right let's get info and
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:56.780]  just give it more memory and would that work maybe maybe not who knew you could try right
[01:47:56.780 --> 01:48:06.860]  the guessing value of it was astounding 1024 right not enough all right 2048 okay seems to run a lot
[01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:14.300]  well let me quit though and try you know 1536 see if that's enough i don't know yeah not not great
[01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:21.180]  it's not good bb edit which i've been using since 1993 uh did not require you to go through these
[01:48:21.180 --> 01:48:25.980]  shenanigans because it implemented its own memory management and so you could open very large
[01:48:25.980 --> 01:48:32.940]  text files without assigning the application uh more memory photoshop had some fancy very fancy
[01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:38.380]  memory management as well including its own virtual memory where oh right it still has a
[01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:42.860]  scratch disk right right it was that was built into photoshop from very early on the idea that
[01:48:42.860 --> 01:48:46.300]  if it couldn't deal with the whole file it would just start writing things out to the disk right
[01:48:46.300 --> 01:48:51.740]  yeah photo it's still it's still there i know that it's still there in photoshop which is great i
[01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:57.180]  was just talking to a friend who's let's say familiar with familiar with the matter with the
[01:48:57.180 --> 01:49:04.060]  source code of photoshop uh there's a surprising amount of code that dates to around 1991 or 1992
[01:49:04.060 --> 01:49:09.260]  that's still inside photoshop i'm not surprised let me tell you about something that's in the
[01:49:09.260 --> 01:49:15.100]  inside flap of this box there's a there's an icon called unix based that's a like a metal
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:22.140]  plaque that's been screwed onto the wall or something unprecedented stability and performance
[01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:26.940]  mac os 10 features an industrial strength unix based foundation that provides powerful advanced
[01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:31.820]  features such as true protected memory preemptive multitasking and advanced memory management giving
[01:49:31.820 --> 01:49:41.660]  your macintosh bulletproof reliability and i will say there was the the least reliable computer that
[01:49:41.660 --> 01:49:49.020]  i used day to day in my entire life was in the last couple of years of classic mac os like os 8
[01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:56.460]  would crash hard multiple times a day for me and so i see what they're getting at here i i see it
[01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:03.500]  uh yeah browsing the web was always dangerous and it because it just seemed i think because
[01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:10.140]  browsing the web has always been computationally very very hard even today you know testing the
[01:50:10.140 --> 01:50:16.140]  speed of web browsers is still a great way to test systems it's it's a very complex thing
[01:50:16.140 --> 01:50:22.860]  and the web has gotten more complex as as computers have gotten more complex you would
[01:50:22.860 --> 01:50:27.100]  just be browsing the web going to a page that you've been to before and then your whole computer
[01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:32.380]  would just lock up because some kind of memory error corrupted memory outside the browser
[01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:42.620]  it it you know it happened less frequently than some people would have you believe like it was
[01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:49.180]  you know you could run it i ran a stable mac os 9 system you know into the 2000s yeah i think the
[01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:54.060]  8 6 era was the worst of it yeah i just have i have very clear memories in the in the mac os
[01:50:54.060 --> 01:50:59.980]  8 5 8 6 era that my mac would just freeze and keep in mind back in those days if an app broke
[01:50:59.980 --> 01:51:05.580]  the whole system was dead usually that was that was why the memory thing and even if it didn't
[01:51:05.580 --> 01:51:12.860]  die you're like i better restart now because this is is dangerous like mac os bless its heart like
[01:51:12.860 --> 01:51:19.020]  it was from another era and it's funny now the mac os 10 is way older than it ever got
[01:51:20.220 --> 01:51:26.220]  but here we are um but it was it was from another era the other thing i recall is like when i went
[01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:33.020]  off to college um i got a unix account or i guess it was vms originally um but like a unix account
[01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:38.220]  and i learned how to use vi and you know command line stuff that i'd never learned before i never
[01:51:38.220 --> 01:51:43.340]  used unix before i went to college and then there was this period where i became a mac user and i
[01:51:43.340 --> 01:51:51.500]  never thought about it again and then mac os 10 arrived and i realized oh no there's unix
[01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:56.220]  underneath here it was a real um jurassic park kind of moment where it's like it's unix i know
[01:51:56.220 --> 01:52:01.980]  this and i was able to use i'm finding i use vi to this day it's like i had no idea that would
[01:52:01.980 --> 01:52:09.980]  happen when i learned it in like the fall of 1988 but mac os 10 having unix underneath means that
[01:52:09.980 --> 01:52:15.420]  i still use it drassel had uh unix systems and we had to use them in the computer science program
[01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:21.900]  but we typically use them just purely through the terminal right like so for most of my years there
[01:52:21.900 --> 01:52:28.220]  i did it from a mac either either on the campus on the network and uh forget the terminal program
[01:52:28.220 --> 01:52:35.020]  we used over the over the network but uh oh from yeah we had a lot of we had a lot of dumb terminals
[01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:38.460]  but yeah from home you use like z term or something like that yeah which never reached
[01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:45.900]  1.0 z term like the most advanced version 0.9 0.9 the best the greatest program to never reach
[01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:51.100]  1.0 in my life was z term i maybe it was z term you just used it on the campus ethernet too i
[01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:55.660]  forget um it's possible that was a great app because not only was it just basically a dumb
[01:52:55.660 --> 01:52:59.580]  terminal where you know your your modem is connected to the network and then you're you're
[01:52:59.580 --> 01:53:04.220]  just doing command line stuff and the individual characters are flying over the the modem but the
[01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:08.620]  nice thing about it is that that z modem format that they had there there was a command line
[01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:13.340]  command you could give on the other end that basically said hey that file there send it to
[01:53:13.340 --> 01:53:21.260]  me yeah and it would it would just start spraying um text essentially back at you um and z term was
[01:53:21.260 --> 01:53:26.060]  smart enough to say oh it's a file transfer and it would just pop up a window that said transferring
[01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:31.100]  file and it would save onto your mac and it was like magic yeah because before max were officially
[01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:37.100]  on the on the internet themselves that's how you would move files around yeah either that or if it
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:44.460]  was a text file i would just ls it cat it copy and paste into bb edit just paste it in and then watch
[01:53:44.460 --> 01:53:52.140]  the modem lights blink sure uh you know but that is partly why to me this 20-year anniversary is
[01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:56.540]  pretty interesting because it's not exactly halfway you know but we've had 20 years of
[01:53:56.540 --> 01:54:05.180]  mac os 10 being the mac operating system and then 1984 to 2001 the only one was the classic mac os
[01:54:05.740 --> 01:54:12.540]  right but it it because of that transition that at least three-year transition you know like
[01:54:12.540 --> 01:54:17.740]  2004 was maybe where we could really say mac os 9 and classic was dead and and you were really
[01:54:17.740 --> 01:54:23.580]  hanging on to a legacy machine at that point you know it there were 20 years of relevance for the
[01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:30.220]  classic mac os from 1984 to maybe 2004 you know there's that three-year overlap so this 20-year
[01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:37.660]  anniversary is sort of to me arguably the halfway point you know here's one the aqua combines
[01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:45.180]  superior ease of use with amazing new functionality such as the doc a breakthrough for organizing
[01:54:45.180 --> 01:54:50.780]  documents and document windows there's a there's a whole page about explaining the doc inside the
[01:54:50.780 --> 01:54:56.140]  box here in the little manual that they have let's because the doc yeah that was i wonder how much
[01:54:56.140 --> 01:55:02.700]  of the doc thing was also um like next step next step pride because that was like similar to stuff
[01:55:02.700 --> 01:55:07.340]  that had been on next step and there were so few next step ui conventions that came over because
[01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:11.980]  obviously the message came down that like the mac users wanted to look like the mac and the next
[01:55:11.980 --> 01:55:17.580]  step people i suspect were maybe a little unhappy with that but the doc was something that managed
[01:55:17.580 --> 01:55:22.380]  to survive and of course our friend james thompson worked on a version of that that i think never
[01:55:22.380 --> 01:55:26.460]  shipped but he was one of the people who was writing the doc they literally hired the guy
[01:55:26.460 --> 01:55:32.540]  who wrote a doc for classic mac os drag thing and put him on the doc team which i find hilarious
[01:55:32.540 --> 01:55:36.780]  like hey there's the shareware guy who's doing something kind of like this bring him in
[01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:44.940]  get that guy in here it was very controversial for long-term mac users because it didn't seem to
[01:55:44.940 --> 01:55:52.060]  work in ways that we expected things to work on the mac yeah and and some of that is sort of hard
[01:55:52.060 --> 01:55:59.420]  to put to words but the you know like drag thing wasn't necessarily something that anybody would
[01:55:59.420 --> 01:56:04.460]  have endorsed hey apple should just buy it and make it part of the operating system you know
[01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:09.740]  at least you know maybe some kind of drag thing light could have been yeah i mean the closest is
[01:56:09.740 --> 01:56:14.620]  that there was the application switcher that you could drag out of the menu bar right in classic
[01:56:14.620 --> 01:56:20.860]  mac os and sort of you had this weird like app for running docs but but the mac os 10 doc was
[01:56:20.860 --> 01:56:25.820]  running apps not running like it is now running apps not running apps and then whatever you could
[01:56:25.820 --> 01:56:31.980]  drag in like a folder right uh a file whatever it just kind of went in there what and the trash
[01:56:31.980 --> 01:56:37.020]  which used to be on the desktop right well doc well that's let's let's get to that but the thing
[01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:42.460]  that made drag thing feel the thing that made drag thing feel mac like and made the pull-off
[01:56:42.460 --> 01:56:48.140]  application switcher feel mac like was that they were pallets they were in a window and a palette
[01:56:48.140 --> 01:56:56.220]  was a legit mac type of window and it was also legitimate in the mac universe of classic mac os
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:57:01.980]  for a palette to be system-wide as opposed to application wide yeah floating palette system
[01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:07.580]  wide right yeah absolutely standard ui and and in fact that was all considered very normal and and
[01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:15.180]  it it's in a way that idiomatic like you just you you just idiomatic understand oh this is totally
[01:57:15.180 --> 01:57:22.780]  acceptable that okay here's a tool palette in photoshop or quirk express right and when i switch
[01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:27.820]  away from quirk express i can still see my document window in the background but the palettes
[01:57:27.820 --> 01:57:35.260]  all disappear because it's no longer the active application so an application palette would appear
[01:57:35.260 --> 01:57:43.980]  when the app was active and disappear when it was inactive automatically global palettes like drag
[01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:48.780]  thing or the application switcher were also pallets and they looked the same but it you just
[01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:55.180]  understood well that's my drag thing palette so i would like it to be visible at all times the doc
[01:57:55.180 --> 01:58:01.980]  isn't a window it's this thing right and it's stuck on the side of your screen not a window
[01:58:01.980 --> 01:58:08.700]  it's a some something different stuck it doesn't follow the rules stuck in one particular location
[01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:16.540]  or other um yes it's unusual it's a it's a new invention for os 10 unlike anything else in the
[01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:25.980]  system right and it that offended my sensibilities of wanting mac os 10 to be more of just a modern
[01:58:25.980 --> 01:58:33.580]  and and not like i wasn't offended that they switched to aqua this fancy lickable appearance
[01:58:34.780 --> 01:58:39.020]  like i get it that hey that was old-fashioned looking and this is new and it's certainly
[01:58:39.020 --> 01:58:44.540]  however much the fancy transparency and everything is in the shadows that are actually shadows as
[01:58:44.540 --> 01:58:49.660]  opposed to just a one pixel black line drawn around whatever you want it to i get it that
[01:58:49.660 --> 01:58:54.460]  these shadows are computationally expensive and it's that's what's making everything slow when
[01:58:54.460 --> 01:59:03.340]  you move windows around and just drag menus down from the top but conceptually most of mac os 10
[01:59:03.340 --> 01:59:10.940]  fit with mac os 9 and in a way that next and mac were very copacetic in that way even when they
[01:59:10.940 --> 01:59:16.780]  were separate products you know that the next never had the weird windows thing where there's
[01:59:16.780 --> 01:59:22.940]  the application window and inside the application window where the document windows and it you know
[01:59:22.940 --> 01:59:29.180]  it was it was always more aligned with the mac they never tried to move away the menu bar right
[01:59:29.900 --> 01:59:33.980]  i mean if the weirdest thing they tried to do early on was maybe put the apple menu in the
[01:59:33.980 --> 01:59:38.540]  middle and have it not be a menu just like a little logo but yeah i think they could never
[01:59:38.540 --> 01:59:44.700]  really get rid of the the menu bar right that's right and it's yeah it's funny because now um
[01:59:44.700 --> 01:59:50.460]  you listen to john saracusa talk and you know he's made a a little uh second career for himself as
[01:59:50.460 --> 01:59:57.020]  developer of apps that bring back os 9 you know classic mac os features to mac os 10 which you
[01:59:57.020 --> 02:00:02.620]  know drag thing did for many years like the trash can like the windowing for me the big change in
[02:00:02.620 --> 02:00:07.900]  mac os 10 was how the rules of windowing worked where if you brought if you clicked one window
[02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:13.420]  in an app all the windows from that app came forward by default which on the old mac os um
[02:00:13.420 --> 02:00:18.380]  it didn't work that way at all and that's still standard behavior but that's not how it worked
[02:00:18.380 --> 02:00:21.980]  back in the day and they they did rethink a whole bunch of those things that you know you can now
[02:00:21.980 --> 02:00:27.580]  buy software written by john saracusa to make it revert back the way it was in 1991 right like if
[02:00:27.580 --> 02:00:34.860]  you had three bb edit windows open and three web browser windows open when you clicked on one of
[02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:40.220]  the bb edit windows all three windows would come forward and all three of them would be in front
[02:00:40.220 --> 02:00:45.820]  of all three of your web browser windows and if you switch to the finder all of the finder windows
[02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:51.500]  would pop to the front you know clicking the window is the same as activating the entire
[02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:59.500]  application right uh you know i think i was opposed to this at first but never as i also saw
[02:00:59.500 --> 02:01:05.180]  the logic of it right like i could see i was like well i see it both ways and you still could bring
[02:01:05.180 --> 02:01:11.340]  a way to this day you still can't if you click the application in the dock it's still the windows
[02:01:11.340 --> 02:01:16.860]  all the windows come forward right i think i said the back backward way but yeah it's per window now
[02:01:16.860 --> 02:01:24.860]  and in classic mac os because again because classic mac os originated as a single application
[02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:29.020]  interface kind of like the iphone and the ipad really when you think about it originally you
[02:01:29.020 --> 02:01:33.580]  could only run one thing and when they went to multi-finder and then to multitasking and system
[02:01:33.580 --> 02:01:38.780]  seven they kept the concept that when an app was frontmost it was frontmost like those palettes
[02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:43.420]  right it's the same idea is like when you're in the app all its windows come forward because
[02:01:43.420 --> 02:01:49.340]  you're in an app and mac os 10 was like no they're just windows whatever interleave them we don't care
[02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:55.740]  yeah it was always i guess in the i think maybe and i think maybe in classic mac os it had to
[02:01:55.740 --> 02:02:01.500]  be this way maybe just for technical limitations but any way of activating an application anyway
[02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:06.780]  always brought all of its open windows forward whereas mac os 10 drew this distinction between
[02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:12.700]  activating a window by just clicking on it right i i kind of see the logic that the mac os 10 way
[02:02:13.580 --> 02:02:19.580]  is is actually more sensible because at least then if you want to interleave
[02:02:20.460 --> 02:02:25.580]  one app one window from this app with another window from another app and not have them
[02:02:27.020 --> 02:02:32.220]  always bring forward all the windows you can you can do it whereas you couldn't before
[02:02:32.220 --> 02:02:38.220]  but it definitely took some getting used to but the doc oh boy the doc i felt was a foreign
[02:02:38.220 --> 02:02:44.220]  invader in the mac interface for at least a decade and i wasn't the sort of person who
[02:02:44.220 --> 02:02:50.060]  i didn't try to like hide it i guess very early on i tried to hide it and there were command line
[02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:56.220]  tricks to kill it permanently and replace it with third-party utilities but i gave up on that at
[02:02:56.220 --> 02:03:01.260]  some point and lived with it but i always felt it was like a grain of sand in my eye
[02:03:01.260 --> 02:03:07.580]  but at some point maybe halfway through maybe 10 years ago i just sort of accepted it and i
[02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:14.220]  and see it and now knowing that it's 20 years and how little the doc has actually changed the doc
[02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:23.420]  of today is remarkably similar to the doc of mac os 10 1.0 and if you take cosmetic differences
[02:03:23.420 --> 02:03:32.300]  aside like how is the glass look of the doc styled you know you take that aside it's it's
[02:03:32.300 --> 02:03:36.700]  i don't i'm not even sure what the differences are i mean they still have the zoom effect so
[02:03:36.700 --> 02:03:42.620]  you can scrub your mouse over and have the the icons jump in size underneath your your mac
[02:03:43.260 --> 02:03:49.980]  they still have the then incredibly impressive demo of the genie effect of a window getting
[02:03:49.980 --> 02:03:58.460]  sucked into the doc right i mean the big changes are you can do like uh stacks and stuff like that
[02:03:58.460 --> 02:04:04.220]  now there's more organizational structure for having folders in there than there was before but
[02:04:04.220 --> 02:04:10.220]  you're right i mean it's not that different from the original conception of it right and
[02:04:10.220 --> 02:04:15.420]  at this point 20 years in it is clearly this is this is i guess where i'm going with this whole
[02:04:15.420 --> 02:04:22.060]  point on the doc it is clearly as much a fundamental can't go anywhere can't really
[02:04:22.060 --> 02:04:29.820]  change it at this point part of the mac as the menu bar and that would have surprised me 20 years
[02:04:29.820 --> 02:04:34.220]  ago that i would come to that conclusion like i saw it as this foreign invader that should
[02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:42.940]  hopefully somebody will be distract steve jobs and take it out and get him not to notice and
[02:04:42.940 --> 02:04:49.660]  replace it with something that's mac like and now i realize the doc is now by definition mac like
[02:04:49.660 --> 02:04:56.540]  it it's it's redefined what it means to be a mac like interface you need the doc the other
[02:04:56.540 --> 02:05:01.740]  difference and and similar i said the genie effect so another big difference for me was
[02:05:02.780 --> 02:05:09.420]  mac os 9 had support for what they called window shade and you could double click the top of a
[02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:16.620]  the top of a window and the entire window would disappear except for the the title bar and it was
[02:05:16.620 --> 02:05:21.580]  a quick way that you could you could just double click the title bar and then you could look behind
[02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:27.580]  a window and then double click again and it would zap back down so if you needed to check something
[02:05:27.580 --> 02:05:33.100]  behind the window you were working on double click the top it would window shade up see what you were
[02:05:33.100 --> 02:05:39.100]  looking at double click again without moving the mouse and it would jump jump back down i used it
[02:05:39.100 --> 02:05:46.300]  all the time it was one of my favorite late era classic features because it wasn't i forget when
[02:05:46.300 --> 02:05:50.620]  it was introduced and it was one of those features that was originally in some third party init
[02:05:51.980 --> 02:05:57.580]  but then was eventually adopted by apple as part of the system but i took to it like water you know
[02:05:58.780 --> 02:06:03.740]  and the thing that always annoyed me about minimizing windows to the doc as opposed to
[02:06:03.740 --> 02:06:09.820]  window shade was that you couldn't undo it immediately right you'd it with the doc or
[02:06:09.820 --> 02:06:14.060]  with window shade you double click see behind it you could double click again without moving
[02:06:14.060 --> 02:06:20.380]  when you when you jump a window into the doc if you want to open it back up you've got to move
[02:06:20.380 --> 02:06:26.300]  your mouse all the way down to the doc and jump it back up you know you can't just double click
[02:06:26.300 --> 02:06:33.100]  double click double click double click to do it undo it do it undo it but now that i've learned
[02:06:33.100 --> 02:06:38.940]  to live with it i see the logic of having this special system place the doc that's not part of
[02:06:38.940 --> 02:06:45.100]  an application but is just there in the system that's where your windows go when they're you know
[02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:52.620]  minimized well and my argument would be um one having because i used to see people who had this
[02:06:52.620 --> 02:06:58.140]  having window shaded windows all over your mac was really not aesthetically pleasing right they're
[02:06:58.140 --> 02:07:04.460]  these weird floating severed rectangles right and secondarily so the doc is better for that i think
[02:07:04.460 --> 02:07:12.300]  secondarily when i hear you describe how you're using them which is to find something my answer
[02:07:12.300 --> 02:07:18.220]  is well see that is a problem that is better solved by either and these are other two good
[02:07:18.220 --> 02:07:24.860]  things that os 10 brought either by expose right by finding a way to find a window on your interface
[02:07:24.860 --> 02:07:31.100]  in a better way or another thing that i really love that the classic mac os didn't have which
[02:07:31.100 --> 02:07:38.540]  is the old uh command tilde uh the command tilde feature that basically cycle through windows yeah
[02:07:38.540 --> 02:07:44.060]  um the keyboard shortcut where you're just like okay i've got 18 windows open tap tap tap tap tap
[02:07:44.060 --> 02:07:47.980]  tap tap tap and you just cycle through all of the windows in that app until you find the one you're
[02:07:47.980 --> 02:07:53.340]  looking for and both of those are like here are other ways to find a thing other than like window
[02:07:53.340 --> 02:08:01.340]  shading everything until you find it um but uh you know there's different ways to do this so um apple
[02:08:02.060 --> 02:08:06.700]  it's interesting that apple sort of like was like okay don't do that use expose this is for this
[02:08:06.700 --> 02:08:12.460]  other thing which i just used today i actually put i was watching a video and it was in a youtube
[02:08:12.460 --> 02:08:17.420]  window or a twitch window actually and i popped it into picture in picture on my mac but you can't
[02:08:17.420 --> 02:08:22.140]  close the window the web browser window or the video stops playing so then i minimized it to the
[02:08:22.140 --> 02:08:26.940]  doc and i'm like aha minimize it to the doc how nice how convenient so i just did that today
[02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:33.340]  uh here's another one of the bullet points from mac os 10 1.0 and this is one that's still with
[02:08:33.340 --> 02:08:38.700]  us today it is it was a great revolutionary feature full pdf support and pdf integration
[02:08:38.700 --> 02:08:43.100]  into the operating system so that was 10 applications can generate standard pdf
[02:08:43.100 --> 02:08:50.220]  documents to be shared with any platform what a great feature that was one that that made me
[02:08:50.220 --> 02:08:54.540]  like while i every time i went back to mac os 9 or used my mac os 9 system i would miss it
[02:08:54.540 --> 02:09:01.420]  immediately because one thing that's true pdf is great format it's a great success story from adobe
[02:09:01.420 --> 02:09:08.860]  and acrobat has always been a terrible application like right from the start from the start yep
[02:09:08.860 --> 02:09:16.700]  i remember it so so here's the thing that's why os 10 was so slow because next step was built on
[02:09:16.700 --> 02:09:23.500]  display postscript the whole idea was what if we took this resolution kind of independent uh
[02:09:23.500 --> 02:09:28.300]  lossless output that you send to a laser printer what if we do a version of that that's essentially
[02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:33.900]  on the screen and that's why next step looked so good and so then they brought it to the mac and
[02:09:33.900 --> 02:09:38.380]  they're like well we're going to do this compositing thing uh and and there was a real
[02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:44.620]  question of like can you do that and how can you do that um but the result is that os 10 stuff
[02:09:44.620 --> 02:09:49.100]  looks way better and what did from the very beginning it looked better it allowed them to
[02:09:49.100 --> 02:09:57.660]  do all those translucency effects that were impossible on classic mac os right it gave them
[02:09:57.660 --> 02:10:06.380]  all of the pdf stuff for free and in the end you know it was actually a real asset but the knock
[02:10:06.380 --> 02:10:12.060]  on it was always that there was so much overhead because it was built to this kind of a little bit
[02:10:12.060 --> 02:10:20.780]  more of an ideal of uh of postscript format whereas quickdraw was done for speed on slow
[02:10:20.780 --> 02:10:28.140]  systems and so like it's a perfect encapsulation in some ways of like we get all of this by using
[02:10:28.140 --> 02:10:34.780]  this technology but here's the payment which is it was slow and i you know that that all that stuff
[02:10:35.580 --> 02:10:41.020]  the whole kind of windowing system and and everything about it and all the built-in stuff
[02:10:41.020 --> 02:10:46.140]  that they inherited from next that they used had great advantages but also like that was one of the
[02:10:46.140 --> 02:10:51.980]  reasons it was so slow for so long here's a here's the story i i can't say who but somebody told me
[02:10:51.980 --> 02:10:56.620]  this story and i believe them that they had and there weren't a lot of people at apple who knew
[02:10:56.620 --> 02:11:05.180]  about it but apple had a lab where they set up side by side mac and comparable windows machine
[02:11:05.180 --> 02:11:11.180]  running windows xp and they had a series of things and they i don't know if i don't know the details
[02:11:11.180 --> 02:11:15.820]  of how they measured the time but whether it was like cameras pointing at the screen or if they
[02:11:15.820 --> 02:11:21.260]  wrote software on both platforms to measure it but they they measured down to like the millisecond
[02:11:21.980 --> 02:11:29.660]  how long it took to drag a window how long it took to pop a menu down and have the full menu
[02:11:29.660 --> 02:11:33.820]  draw like how long does it take for the whole menu to be there how long does it take how long
[02:11:33.820 --> 02:11:40.060]  when you move the mouse over an item like a menu item with a hover effect how long from when the
[02:11:40.060 --> 02:11:46.700]  pointer gets there does the hover effect render on screen you know resizing windows all sorts of
[02:11:46.700 --> 02:11:56.300]  stuff like that and they knew that mac os 10 in those early 2000s was behind windows xp on all of
[02:11:56.300 --> 02:12:01.420]  it and it was slower and it was always their bet that was their benchmark and that was what they
[02:12:01.420 --> 02:12:11.260]  were measuring again how much closer can they get mac os 10 which looked way better but needed you
[02:12:11.260 --> 02:12:17.100]  know the ideal would be to both to to look better and be faster and they had this lab where they
[02:12:17.100 --> 02:12:23.260]  would measure against xp and that's that's what they used to build 10 1 and 10 2 and 10 3 and 10
[02:12:23.260 --> 02:12:32.220]  4 as they got closer and closer and then vista shipped and and they installed it and vista was
[02:12:32.220 --> 02:12:37.500]  slower than xp and it was in fact already slower than mac os 10 and they didn't know what to do
[02:12:38.140 --> 02:12:44.060]  and there were people who were like well our our job is done you know we we shouldn't be you know
[02:12:44.780 --> 02:12:49.100]  now we're faster but there were other people who were like well we should just pretend vista
[02:12:49.100 --> 02:12:55.020]  doesn't exist and keep testing against xp because that's still the gold that that was our established
[02:12:55.020 --> 02:13:01.420]  gold standard for how snappy things should be and and the side that did that won out was the side
[02:13:01.420 --> 02:13:06.700]  that measured against xp and they just their the lab where they tested that just pretended vista
[02:13:06.700 --> 02:13:12.460]  didn't exist because they still wanted to keep making the interface faster hardware for hardware
[02:13:12.460 --> 02:13:16.940]  don't just count on moore's law and faster hardware to get us out of this we should build
[02:13:16.940 --> 02:13:23.660]  something snappy and i think part of the payoff was that then was that you know it wasn't that
[02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:33.580]  many years from this 2001 really really slow desktop operating system to 2007 when they were
[02:13:33.580 --> 02:13:40.460]  doing a lot of the same things on a tiny little phone using a terrible little arm processor you
[02:13:40.460 --> 02:13:45.740]  know but i think that at some point in that era where they decided that we need to keep making
[02:13:45.740 --> 02:13:50.620]  mac os 10 faster even though it's not really painfully slow anymore paid off in their ability
[02:13:50.620 --> 02:13:58.300]  to make ios 1.0 when they did yeah i mean also realistically windows users were still using xp
[02:13:58.300 --> 02:14:02.300]  right like vista right kind of crashed and burned so it turned out that people were comparing
[02:14:02.300 --> 02:14:08.380]  everything to xp and they including vista and it didn't measure up but uh but you're right the the
[02:14:09.740 --> 02:14:14.380]  history like as mac users we're looking at the 20 years of mac os 10 and saying oh well you know it
[02:14:14.380 --> 02:14:20.620]  has all these important milestones and all of that its most important legacy to the world
[02:14:20.620 --> 02:14:26.780]  is probably that it was the source material from which ios was created or the iphone os was created
[02:14:26.780 --> 02:14:34.380]  and that is on you know the most successful consumer individual consumer technology product
[02:14:34.380 --> 02:14:41.980]  of the last 20 years at least right like the the the source for the iphone is it's funny to think
[02:14:41.980 --> 02:14:47.900]  of it this way but that that might be like the number one fact about mac os 10 in fact to the
[02:14:47.900 --> 02:14:52.540]  fact that they used it to reassure people that it was a good operating system running on the iphone
[02:14:52.540 --> 02:14:58.140]  because they said it had os 10 inside which is kind of weird and kind of not true but kind of
[02:14:58.140 --> 02:15:04.300]  true they wanted to they want to reassure people and by 2007 it was reassuring and impressive to
[02:15:04.300 --> 02:15:10.460]  hear that the iphone essentially ran os 10 underneath the the hood right i just remember
[02:15:10.460 --> 02:15:16.940]  the one thing uh that i think they said os 10 at on stage but then there was always the
[02:15:17.740 --> 02:15:23.980]  the word salad slide which is still too i hope apple never gets away from it is the slide where
[02:15:23.980 --> 02:15:30.300]  they just put up a slide on an event and it just has 50 or 60 different things oh yeah all on
[02:15:30.300 --> 02:15:36.060]  screen and one of them it just said cocoa and that was that was like the moment in the thing that like
[02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:41.100]  mac developer friends of ours like froze and they were like holy crap it's cocoa you know and they
[02:15:41.100 --> 02:15:45.420]  never mentioned that on stage because they weren't talking about people developing famously weren't
[02:15:45.420 --> 02:15:50.460]  talking about people developing third-party apps for it yet but it was you know this is the real
[02:15:50.460 --> 02:15:57.020]  deal we're making all this stuff to run on the phone the same way you guys are making apps to
[02:15:57.020 --> 02:16:02.140]  run on on the mac right i think something similar was in there i don't know if we have a name for
[02:16:02.140 --> 02:16:06.300]  it whether it's like the parfait or the layer cake but you know that slide where they're like there's
[02:16:06.300 --> 02:16:09.980]  the subsystem and then there's a layer for it and then there's a layer on top of it and that was
[02:16:09.980 --> 02:16:13.900]  another one of those reassuring layers of like it's a unix subsystem underneath darwin is
[02:16:13.900 --> 02:16:19.500]  underneath don't worry it's okay right and i'm like okay what a relief yeah because you know you
[02:16:19.500 --> 02:16:27.420]  didn't know from the demo alone whether it was some sort of thing that was more like ipod the
[02:16:27.420 --> 02:16:33.820]  ipod didn't run an apple os so right right no right and by that time when ipods got color
[02:16:33.820 --> 02:16:38.620]  screens and you know as much as i love the black and white screens and the you know let's just use
[02:16:38.620 --> 02:16:43.660]  chicago 12 bitmap again you know it it looked cooler when they went to color screens and they
[02:16:43.660 --> 02:16:50.620]  were rendering everything in anti-aliased myriad and and it looked like os 10 sort of styling and
[02:16:50.620 --> 02:16:57.660]  lickability and cool 3d effects on on selected items and stuff like that but it was all just
[02:16:57.660 --> 02:17:05.580]  sort of a thin veneer on a consumer electronic device operating system not a true computing
[02:17:05.580 --> 02:17:11.260]  operating system like no one ever was going to be able to run a web browser from their ipod
[02:17:13.340 --> 02:17:19.260]  you know yeah i don't think i mean i know somebody somewhere is clever enough to make it happen but
[02:17:19.260 --> 02:17:23.180]  it was there was like a script that you could rip the text out and put it into an ipod note
[02:17:23.180 --> 02:17:27.740]  and then stick it on the hard drive or something but it was not yeah it was not browsing the
[02:17:27.740 --> 02:17:35.820]  internet on no no don't do that uh any other thoughts from the 20-year uh anniversary
[02:17:37.980 --> 02:17:45.100]  i don't know i mean we we got off of 10 to 11 which is it took a long time uh it really
[02:17:45.100 --> 02:17:52.700]  blows my mind when i think about how we have outpaced the classic mac os that mac os 10
[02:17:52.700 --> 02:17:58.540]  which was this new thing that was replacing this this uh monolith this incredibly like a granite
[02:17:58.540 --> 02:18:07.260]  mountain of like classic mac os and now it's been a lot longer since then um but i guess what i
[02:18:07.260 --> 02:18:12.780]  would say is the the other funny thing that i think about sometimes is is how i don't feel like
[02:18:12.780 --> 02:18:20.460]  there's a replacement for mac os at this point like where we were after all those years was
[02:18:21.180 --> 02:18:26.940]  desperately needing a replacement for classic mac os and because i think of the side effect of apple
[02:18:26.940 --> 02:18:33.580]  developing ios and the iphone and the ipad over the last decade and then them spending the last
[02:18:33.580 --> 02:18:38.140]  two or three years in what i don't think people talk about enough when they when they made that
[02:18:38.140 --> 02:18:43.660]  statement that they were actually spending a lot of time getting the drift out of the operating
[02:18:43.660 --> 02:18:49.980]  systems that they had drifted apart and then i think they announced maybe for catalina um
[02:18:49.980 --> 02:18:55.500]  or maybe it was before maybe it was it was um mojave they said we did a lot of work to get the
[02:18:55.500 --> 02:19:01.900]  subsystems to be the same and obviously the reason for that was catalyst and and ultimately running
[02:19:01.900 --> 02:19:06.140]  ios apps on the mac that you can't you had to have the subsystems and the frameworks and stuff
[02:19:06.140 --> 02:19:11.260]  kind of all be back in line and they all drifted apart but as part of that and as part of going
[02:19:11.260 --> 02:19:15.980]  forward having swift and swift ui and having catalyst and having you know all of these things
[02:19:15.980 --> 02:19:21.900]  that are in common basically that's the infusion of the next generation operating system with the
[02:19:21.900 --> 02:19:27.820]  mac os so instead of them sort of throwing away mac os and saying here's new mac os number three
[02:19:27.820 --> 02:19:33.020]  instead what we're in the middle of now is this sort of um reinfusion of this thing that was
[02:19:33.020 --> 02:19:38.220]  created out of mac os developed on its own became insanely popular and now is being kind of re
[02:19:39.180 --> 02:19:45.420]  imported back into this kind of a a hole that's maybe greater than the sum of its parts because
[02:19:45.420 --> 02:19:50.300]  it's it's sort of the only platform that can run mac stuff and run ios stuff and i think that's
[02:19:50.300 --> 02:19:56.140]  fascinating because you know 20 years it's like a good amount of time to sort of say it's over
[02:19:56.140 --> 02:20:03.100]  what's what's next and the answer is what's next is actually this plus that that we've been working
[02:20:03.100 --> 02:20:09.820]  on for the last 10 or 15 years and i i can't envision a scenario where this just doesn't keep
[02:20:09.820 --> 02:20:16.940]  on going for you know a decade more at least there was a quote that steve jobs had i don't have it
[02:20:16.940 --> 02:20:21.180]  handy and it doesn't really matter because i know we're past it 20 years has definitely passed it but
[02:20:21.180 --> 02:20:27.180]  he when he was like introducing mac os 10 and he said this is the foundation for apple and the mac
[02:20:27.180 --> 02:20:33.420]  for the next 10 years or maybe he said 15 years you know maybe let's say 15 i'll find i'll try
[02:20:33.420 --> 02:20:40.940]  to find a quote for the show notes but it was 15 at the most and it felt like a bold statement and
[02:20:40.940 --> 02:20:45.340]  steve jobs liked to do things say things like that like when he said the iphone was five years ahead
[02:20:45.340 --> 02:20:51.660]  of the competition um but that seemed you know again that seems fair in hindsight it really did
[02:20:51.660 --> 02:20:58.220]  seem like android phones took at least until 2011 or 2012 to be to do some of the things that the
[02:20:58.220 --> 02:21:05.020]  original iphone could do display wise um right to be fair he also said the imac g4 was setting them
[02:21:05.020 --> 02:21:09.580]  up for the next decade and that to be very much not true it didn't didn't always nail it but i
[02:21:09.580 --> 02:21:18.380]  think what there was a weird thing that steve jobs part of his genius was this ability to always be
[02:21:19.420 --> 02:21:26.300]  looking for the next thing but to be building things to last as they go along and that the
[02:21:26.300 --> 02:21:33.420]  you know that the foundation of of the next system really was sound in terms of the way
[02:21:33.420 --> 02:21:39.980]  that things are layered and this idea of a system directory for the operating system and a library
[02:21:39.980 --> 02:21:44.540]  directory for stuff that was system-wide but the user could put stuff in and it's there for all
[02:21:44.540 --> 02:21:50.060]  users and then the user's home folder has a library folder where there's just these items
[02:21:50.060 --> 02:21:54.300]  just for that user so that another user on the same system wouldn't wouldn't be bothered with
[02:21:54.300 --> 02:21:59.340]  those preferences you know they could have their own that's that's a foundation that is sound and
[02:21:59.340 --> 02:22:06.140]  is sound and built to last and and it's elegant and it's graceful and it's when you learn how it
[02:22:06.140 --> 02:22:12.940]  works under the hood it's nothing at all like the windows registry where it's just this garbled mess
[02:22:12.940 --> 02:22:19.660]  of things you know and you know i've mentioned this on podcast before like with my son with his
[02:22:19.660 --> 02:22:25.260]  gaming pc and looking into certain problems with it you find out that on modern windows there's
[02:22:25.260 --> 02:22:29.660]  still there's like three different display preferences where there's like the new one
[02:22:29.660 --> 02:22:34.940]  that looks new and then there's one that looks a little bit older and then there's always like
[02:22:34.940 --> 02:22:39.900]  a little options or advanced button in the bottom corner and you're back in windows xp yeah it's all
[02:22:39.900 --> 02:22:46.620]  still there all the way down and yep you know that apple doesn't get enough credit for for the
[02:22:46.620 --> 02:22:51.740]  moment where apple just ruthlessly says it's dead it's gone right we're moving on and and we're not
[02:22:51.740 --> 02:22:55.260]  and and people complain and they're like oh you're making my thing incompatible and i'm gonna have to
[02:22:55.260 --> 02:23:00.300]  buy a new computer but like microsoft is the other side of that which is their great benefit
[02:23:00.300 --> 02:23:06.860]  is their huge user base but their great liability is that they can never say goodbye to this stuff
[02:23:07.420 --> 02:23:12.700]  and and you get you look under the covers and you're like i mean you have a tivo right i have
[02:23:12.700 --> 02:23:19.260]  a tivo and for years and i love my tivo even now but for years you go one level down in the
[02:23:19.260 --> 02:23:24.700]  interface in any direction and you're in standard definition four by three you're like what are you
[02:23:24.700 --> 02:23:29.340]  doing all of the troubleshooting stuff we had a weird we had a weird problem a couple months ago
[02:23:29.340 --> 02:23:34.300]  where the tivo couldn't get the the tv guide directory stuff and troubleshooting it was a
[02:23:34.300 --> 02:23:40.620]  weird pain in the ass and all of it was in standard def yeah and it really felt comical
[02:23:40.620 --> 02:23:47.180]  doing it on a 4k tv it's like oh my god yeah and it reminded me that that's very much like the
[02:23:47.180 --> 02:23:51.820]  windows thing where whenever i'm in windows 10 and i i suddenly find myself in a very familiar
[02:23:51.820 --> 02:23:58.700]  windows xp style uh control panel interface i'm like oh no i looked you know you don't look inside
[02:23:58.700 --> 02:24:03.660]  the walls don't don't don't open up the walls and look inside there no you don't want to look in
[02:24:03.660 --> 02:24:10.700]  there none of these a true architectural metaphor doesn't completely hold up but in some ways mac
[02:24:10.700 --> 02:24:18.220]  os 10 is still a single building and the building it's one building and xp is sort of like at some
[02:24:18.220 --> 02:24:22.620]  point they built a new build they left the old building and then they built a new building around
[02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:28.540]  it and if you go down to the first floor you can still find this entire old building inside it and
[02:24:28.540 --> 02:24:33.660]  then a couple years ago they built a new building around the second building and now it's like like
[02:24:33.660 --> 02:24:38.700]  three levels of of again here i am mixing metaphors like three russian nesting dolls
[02:24:38.700 --> 02:24:42.620]  of buildings a building in a building in a building and sometimes you really need to go
[02:24:42.620 --> 02:24:47.660]  into the old building in the old building down in the basement of that building to fix something
[02:24:47.660 --> 02:24:54.860]  whereas mac os 10 not that it has no historical baggage but it has so little that you never really
[02:24:54.860 --> 02:25:00.300]  find yourself like looking at something like oh this part looks like it's 20 years old this
[02:25:00.300 --> 02:25:07.260]  renders this renders fonts the old way right the only so here's the one place where i'm going to
[02:25:07.260 --> 02:25:14.460]  say os 10 if i had to pick one thing where it's the old building it's system preferences it's not
[02:25:14.460 --> 02:25:19.660]  resizable right yep syracuse and i talked about that right right right it was a great conversation
[02:25:19.660 --> 02:25:23.260]  but it's like it's absolutely right i hadn't really thought about it and you look at system
[02:25:23.260 --> 02:25:29.180]  preferences and you think to yourself why hasn't this been changed and the answer is they either
[02:25:29.180 --> 02:25:32.700]  they think it's fine i don't think they think it's fine it's just like it's never a high enough
[02:25:32.700 --> 02:25:38.700]  priority but you know that should be a settings app because you think you should call it settings
[02:25:38.700 --> 02:25:46.620]  it should be uh modern and resizable and all of these things like it's still the shape of
[02:25:46.620 --> 02:25:52.140]  the smallest display that was available when os 10 was released right like we got to fit it on
[02:25:52.140 --> 02:25:56.940]  the screen and i know if you click an individual ones the size changes a little bit but essentially
[02:25:56.940 --> 02:26:02.300]  they're all within this little block and the there aren't that many places like that i could
[02:26:02.300 --> 02:26:06.860]  still say like they've even things like font book they brushed up i would say if you do command t
[02:26:06.860 --> 02:26:13.980]  in apps and the font picker comes up that feels very much like the old uh mac os 10 next interface
[02:26:13.980 --> 02:26:18.540]  from the early days but there's very few things that are like that and even the ones that are like
[02:26:18.540 --> 02:26:23.020]  that they've all gotten a new coat of paint like they've changed the energy saver icon like five
[02:26:23.020 --> 02:26:28.860]  times over the years as as light bulbs evolve seriously seriously they keep changing the light
[02:26:28.860 --> 02:26:34.140]  bulb and the energy saver icon uh to me it was it was a edison bulb and then it was a compact
[02:26:34.140 --> 02:26:39.020]  fluorescent bulb and now it's an led like somebody's paying attention to that stuff but
[02:26:39.020 --> 02:26:44.460]  they still haven't said you know what we need to do is really rethink system preferences they just
[02:26:44.460 --> 02:26:50.140]  nobody wants to go there so that maybe that's the the windows xp hidden layer on on mac os 10
[02:26:50.140 --> 02:26:56.940]  and i think that the version numbers sort of belie that and eric show that sort of thinking
[02:26:56.940 --> 02:27:03.020]  where like from 1980 or 79 78 wherever you want to draw the you know origins of the modern
[02:27:03.020 --> 02:27:10.060]  you know the apple personal computer to 2000 there's you know you got about 20 years in there
[02:27:10.060 --> 02:27:16.060]  and not just with apple but with everybody when you'd make a new operating system it would have
[02:27:16.060 --> 02:27:21.340]  a shelf span where it would eventually you know it it it would either never take off in the first
[02:27:21.340 --> 02:27:27.980]  place or if it did it would go seven eight nine ten years and then be antiquated and something
[02:27:27.980 --> 02:27:33.580]  would come next and that would be the next thing and so saying hey this is built this is our
[02:27:33.580 --> 02:27:40.780]  foundation for 15 years was a bold statement because you know 15 years from 2001 took you back
[02:27:40.780 --> 02:27:49.020]  to 1986 and this is nothing like you could do in 1986 right yeah where and i think that the version
[02:27:49.020 --> 02:27:58.940]  numbers sort of you know the 10.1 10.2 10.3 where really those were versions 2.0 3.0 4.0 right
[02:27:58.940 --> 02:28:12.460]  um like so what we call big serb mac os 11 should be mac os 10 16.0 or 17.0 i guess 17.0 because
[02:28:12.460 --> 02:28:21.580]  mac os 10.1 should have been 2.0 so i guess we're up to like version 17.0 10 10 yeah version 16 you
[02:28:21.580 --> 02:28:25.980]  could even say version 16 because catalina was 10.15 yeah or yeah version 17
[02:28:25.980 --> 02:28:34.220]  yeah if there was no version zero version 17 mac mac os x and i'd 17 and i think it was kind of
[02:28:34.220 --> 02:28:40.620]  crazy even to the biggest optimist at the time like you know who knows maybe steve jobs or
[02:28:40.620 --> 02:28:48.620]  bertrand or uh you know uh i don't know who had the most optimistic outlook at the length of time
[02:28:48.620 --> 02:28:54.620]  that this thing they called mac os 10 20 years ago would have a shelf span and i don't know who
[02:28:54.620 --> 02:29:02.620]  shelf span you know 2021 with the 17th major release seemed incredibly ambitious i think
[02:29:02.620 --> 02:29:07.580]  that that was too much even for steve jobs to declare and yet in hindsight it worked out that
[02:29:07.580 --> 02:29:16.700]  way and i still has as bright a future as it's had at any point in the era like i think that we
[02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:22.460]  you know they built a thing that was truly built to last and for certain tasks which aren't going
[02:29:22.460 --> 02:29:29.660]  away and for certain form factors which aren't going away like the laptop it's or the desktop
[02:29:29.660 --> 02:29:34.940]  computer where you have a big display and the most powerful computer you can build in a box connected
[02:29:34.940 --> 02:29:45.020]  to it this system still has a you know decades in front of it maybe yeah i think so because it's gone
[02:29:45.020 --> 02:29:50.460]  beyond what it was ever originally intended to be because of the iphone and the ipad and now that
[02:29:50.460 --> 02:29:56.220]  they are getting mixed back together it's it's uh yeah i i just i don't see the end of it which is
[02:29:56.860 --> 02:30:01.100]  a remarkable and everything does have an end but it's a remarkable thing to be standing 20 years
[02:30:01.660 --> 02:30:08.060]  forward from that saying it's still here basically more or less it's still here and i still don't see
[02:30:08.060 --> 02:30:14.460]  an end of the road for this thing yeah i i agree well what a great discussion i appreciate you
[02:30:14.460 --> 02:30:18.780]  being here as always and again it was good to talk about software and not really talk about
[02:30:18.780 --> 02:30:26.140]  any particular hardware um we can mention throw out the uh toss out if you love and you want to
[02:30:26.140 --> 02:30:33.820]  hear me and jason talk for three more hours yep but have it be about hardware you can do it at the
[02:30:33.820 --> 02:30:44.220]  on the outtake episodes of the 20 for 22 20 max for 2020 uh that's it relay fm slash 20 for 20 max
[02:30:44.220 --> 02:30:49.580]  20 max all right but you can just take the whole thing you could just you could just google relay
[02:30:49.580 --> 02:30:56.300]  20 max yeah you'll you'll find it you'll find it sixcolors.com where you can spell colors
[02:30:56.300 --> 02:31:03.260]  whichever way is appropriate for you uh is of course the website you're right with dan moran
[02:31:03.260 --> 02:31:10.700]  and uh uh the incomparable where you have a bunch of other podcasts and upgrade with mike
[02:31:10.700 --> 02:31:15.580]  hurley and what else you do how do you find time for this that's it that's about it yeah you know
[02:31:15.580 --> 02:31:22.060]  i i i do a lot of podcasts that's definitely that's definitely true uh yeah it's it's good
[02:31:22.060 --> 02:31:31.580]  keep me it's keeping me busy my thanks to our sponsors we had uh mac welden flat file uh square
