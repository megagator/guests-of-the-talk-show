[00:00.000 --> 00:06.800]  Do you have that too? Don't you have that? Am I making this up that you've got your second toast sticks up further than your big?
[00:06.800 --> 00:09.000]  No, I always called that a freak toe when I was little.
[00:09.000 --> 00:14.400]  Supposedly it means you're going to be financially well-off when you get older.
[00:14.400 --> 00:20.000]  I actually looked it up years ago and I think that's like genetically the more common one.
[00:20.000 --> 00:24.300]  So having it not be that way is actually the freakish way but it still looks weird to me.
[00:24.300 --> 00:26.300]  Like you don't ever draw a foot that way.
[00:26.300 --> 00:28.500]  No, you would never draw a foot that way.
[00:28.500 --> 00:35.700]  But I remember that like the tips of my second and third toast would be just blistered to hell.
[00:35.700 --> 00:41.000]  And so I would get up earlier I would skip breakfast and go to the trainer.
[00:41.000 --> 00:43.600]  And it's sort of like being a pro athlete. It was like a nice professional.
[00:43.600 --> 00:47.000]  It was like it was a, it could sound university in Pennsylvania.
[00:47.000 --> 00:58.200]  And you go to the trainer and there was a real college athletic trainer and he would like take razor blades to your blisters and do them right.
[00:58.200 --> 01:02.200]  Is that the treatment?
[01:02.200 --> 01:06.200]  Well, I wouldn't recommend doing it yourself.
[01:06.200 --> 01:11.200]  It seems like it was like a fine line between cutting off too much of the skin and too little.
[01:11.200 --> 01:16.200]  But it hurt like hell in the morning and it would just feel like I can't, it was terrible.
[01:16.200 --> 01:17.200]  It was like you couldn't even walk.
[01:17.200 --> 01:24.200]  But then after a while it just sort of, you know, you just get numb to the pain and then you know, just play.
[01:24.200 --> 01:25.200]  All right.
[01:25.200 --> 01:29.200]  Never much for summer camp. We used to have a playground like a local playground would run,
[01:29.200 --> 01:35.200]  pay high school kids to supervise from like nine to noon in the morning.
[01:35.200 --> 01:41.200]  And it'd be like supervised kickball games and box hockey and arts and crafts.
[01:41.200 --> 01:43.200]  Who's paying the insurance on that?
[01:43.200 --> 01:50.200]  I don't, I think it was, it was like a, you know, this would be like the very late 70s and early 80s.
[01:50.200 --> 01:53.200]  I think it was a holdout from a smaller, simpler America.
[01:53.200 --> 01:56.200]  I was just going to say it's a simpler time, right?
[01:56.200 --> 02:02.200]  Where the municipal, the cities, the little town where I grew up, the municipal government paid for it somehow.
[02:02.200 --> 02:07.200]  It was in the school, like they'd open up a little hallway in the school, which is next to the playground.
[02:07.200 --> 02:11.200]  So then there was a ping pong table in there. You could play ping pong when it rained.
[02:11.200 --> 02:14.200]  And that's where the bathroom must have been because you need at least one place.
[02:14.200 --> 02:21.200]  Right. And there was a bathroom and a locker, a little locker where they'd keep the kickballs and the bases and stuff like that.
[02:21.200 --> 02:22.200]  Right.
[02:22.200 --> 02:26.200]  And then they'd open it up at night, too. It was like six to eight at night or something like that.
[02:26.200 --> 02:30.200]  Like they'd be closed from like noon to six and everybody would go to the community pool or whatever.
[02:30.200 --> 02:34.200]  But from like nine to noon and six to eight, they'd be open up.
[02:34.200 --> 02:37.200]  Gotta keep you off the street somehow, I guess.
[02:37.200 --> 02:38.200]  Yeah, I guess.
[02:38.200 --> 02:41.200]  I don't know. I grew up in like a, in a housing development.
[02:41.200 --> 02:45.200]  So we had, I don't know, a couple dozen kids all around the same age.
[02:45.200 --> 02:48.200]  So that was, we sort of had our own makeshift camp, I think.
[02:48.200 --> 02:51.200]  Yeah, I didn't know anybody who went to camp camp, though.
[02:51.200 --> 02:56.200]  Like I said, if your parents love you, they keep you around, I think.
[02:56.200 --> 02:57.200]  Yeah.
[02:57.200 --> 03:01.200]  I think Jonas has mixed feelings about it. Seems like a nice camp.
[03:01.200 --> 03:04.200]  And you know, they've got, he loves a swim, they've got a pool.
[03:04.200 --> 03:06.200]  They play games and stuff.
[03:06.200 --> 03:10.200]  But I feel like, you know, his view is that the inside of our house is sort of like a camp.
[03:10.200 --> 03:13.200]  It's got way better video games.
[03:13.200 --> 03:16.200]  Yeah, we've got video games and air conditioning and.
[03:16.200 --> 03:19.200]  Don't have to take out the bus to get there.
[03:19.200 --> 03:22.200]  Right. They're a refrigerator full of cold beverages.
[03:22.200 --> 03:24.200]  And that's about it.
[03:24.200 --> 03:30.200]  All right. Well, we got to get the show on the road because there's some exciting soccer matches coming up that I really, really want to see.
[03:30.200 --> 03:31.200]  So is this true?
[03:31.200 --> 03:33.200]  No, of course it's not. Soccer's the worst.
[03:33.200 --> 03:35.200]  You're not following the world.
[03:35.200 --> 03:36.200]  I am following it.
[03:36.200 --> 03:39.200]  I'm hating every minute of it because I'm a masochist. I'm following it.
[03:39.200 --> 03:41.200]  Did you ever play soccer?
[03:41.200 --> 03:45.200]  No, I like, you know, Jim soccer and I was half decent, but no,
[03:45.200 --> 03:48.200]  I never even, I never went out for any of the teams or anything.
[03:48.200 --> 03:50.200]  No, I didn't either.
[03:50.200 --> 03:52.200]  It just seemed interminable to me.
[03:52.200 --> 03:55.200]  Well, and I think playing it is way better than watching it.
[03:55.200 --> 03:57.200]  Yeah, I don't even know about that.
[03:57.200 --> 03:59.200]  I don't know. I just felt so clumsy to me.
[03:59.200 --> 04:04.200]  Like, it just seemed to me like, it seems to me like basketball and soccer are.
[04:04.200 --> 04:08.200]  Peer sports, you know, two teams, they're going for goals.
[04:08.200 --> 04:12.200]  There's, there's severe limits on how you can touch and advance the ball.
[04:12.200 --> 04:14.200]  And it seems like to me, I always seem to me like,
[04:14.200 --> 04:17.200]  basketball is the one where what, what is it that separates us from the other animals?
[04:17.200 --> 04:18.200]  It's our hand.
[04:18.200 --> 04:19.200]  Right.
[04:19.200 --> 04:22.200]  And we're purposely not using them in this one sport.
[04:22.200 --> 04:23.200]  Right.
[04:23.200 --> 04:26.200]  Well, I mean, the obvious corollary is really hockey though,
[04:26.200 --> 04:30.200]  but hockey manages to be way more exciting than soccer to me.
[04:30.200 --> 04:31.200]  Yeah.
[04:31.200 --> 04:36.200]  And again, you get to use your hands a little or at least a stick that's, you know, right.
[04:36.200 --> 04:37.200]  Right.
[04:37.200 --> 04:41.200]  I think, I think Greece is playing today, but I, God,
[04:41.200 --> 04:43.200]  I hate every minute of this.
[04:43.200 --> 04:45.200]  I'm glad it's only once every four years.
[04:45.200 --> 04:49.200]  Do you root for the Greeks just out of heritage, family heritage?
[04:49.200 --> 04:51.200]  Yeah, you know, for my dad, maybe.
[04:51.200 --> 04:53.200]  I honestly, I never cared.
[04:53.200 --> 04:54.200]  Yeah.
[04:54.200 --> 04:56.200]  I, you know, I was born in America.
[04:56.200 --> 05:01.200]  I'm an American, but I'm only, well, I guess I'm 50% Greek.
[05:01.200 --> 05:04.200]  That's pretty Greek, but I don't really trust me.
[05:04.200 --> 05:07.200]  You're pretty, you're pretty, you've seen my forearms.
[05:07.200 --> 05:10.200]  You were going there.
[05:10.200 --> 05:11.200]  I went there first.
[05:11.200 --> 05:12.200]  Fuck you.
[05:12.200 --> 05:15.200]  What's his name, Monteiro, is rooting for the Portuguese.
[05:15.200 --> 05:16.200]  Yeah.
[05:16.200 --> 05:19.200]  And he has, I don't know if he's even serious or if he's just trying to,
[05:19.200 --> 05:21.200]  it really seemed like trolling.
[05:21.200 --> 05:26.200]  And I hope it was because it was either trolling or he is like the worst sports fan I've ever seen,
[05:26.200 --> 05:28.200]  worse than you even.
[05:28.200 --> 05:29.200]  Right.
[05:29.200 --> 05:30.200]  Right.
[05:30.200 --> 05:32.200]  Because it's, how could you not be rooting for the Americans?
[05:32.200 --> 05:35.200]  Well, I mean, like, if he wants to root for the Portuguese, that's all right.
[05:35.200 --> 05:38.200]  But like, if you followed his Twitter stream during the Portugal US match,
[05:38.200 --> 05:44.200]  it was just, I mean, it was just, you'd want to throw something through the wall.
[05:44.200 --> 05:45.200]  Yeah.
[05:45.200 --> 05:46.200]  Yeah.
[05:46.200 --> 05:51.200]  I kind of got the feeling that he was, he was just trolling when he started complaining about the rest.
[05:51.200 --> 05:52.200]  Right.
[05:52.200 --> 05:53.200]  So I don't think we're in the US's favor at all.
[05:53.200 --> 05:55.200]  I don't think, I think it was a well-refereed match.
[05:55.200 --> 05:59.200]  Well, and like on, on Dempsey's goal, he was, he kept calling for an off sides.
[05:59.200 --> 06:02.200]  And then meanwhile, the announcers are not, like it wasn't even close.
[06:02.200 --> 06:03.200]  Right.
[06:03.200 --> 06:05.200]  Well, that wasn't even, like it wasn't as if there was any question in an offside.
[06:05.200 --> 06:06.200]  So.
[06:06.200 --> 06:07.200]  Right.
[06:07.200 --> 06:11.200]  So the question will thing in the officiating there was the extra, the one extra minute of, uh, extra time.
[06:11.200 --> 06:13.200]  He went from four to five minutes, right?
[06:13.200 --> 06:14.200]  Right.
[06:14.200 --> 06:15.200]  And that's when they scored in that.
[06:15.200 --> 06:17.200]  And that's when they scored was in the fifth minute.
[06:17.200 --> 06:18.200]  Yeah.
[06:18.200 --> 06:23.200]  And supposedly they're saying that the, I, when I read after the match is that the whoever, whoever the mysterious
[06:23.200 --> 06:30.200]  referee is who gets to decide how many minutes of extra time there is added another fifth minute.
[06:30.200 --> 06:35.200]  So he added four and any added one on, on the last US substitution,
[06:35.200 --> 06:42.200]  where the US, the guy being substituted was like crawling off the field, which is possibly justified.
[06:42.200 --> 06:46.200]  Although, from what the announcers said is, is a time-honored tradition.
[06:46.200 --> 06:47.200]  Oh, wow.
[06:47.200 --> 06:49.200]  It's horrible.
[06:49.200 --> 06:55.200]  I mean, this is, this is what happened against Ghana the past two world cups for the US.
[06:55.200 --> 07:01.200]  Uh, that, you know, they got a lead and then they were just, everybody was suddenly struck down by injury.
[07:01.200 --> 07:04.200]  Balls are being kicked out of the stadium.
[07:04.200 --> 07:05.200]  We don't have any more balls.
[07:05.200 --> 07:07.200]  Somebody get a pump.
[07:07.200 --> 07:17.200]  Well, I mean, what I don't, I have so many complaints about soccer, but the one that really gets me is that we can use the stop button on a stopwatch.
[07:17.200 --> 07:23.200]  It is literally called a stopwatch because you can start the time and then you can stop it.
[07:23.200 --> 07:30.200]  Instead of just letting it run for 45 minutes and then saying, yeah, there was about two minutes of extra time we need to add.
[07:30.200 --> 07:37.200]  Yeah, it seems, it seems like some kind of bizarre, antiquated, you know, thing, holdover from 100 years ago.
[07:37.200 --> 07:45.200]  Right, but then meanwhile, they've got like, like, like the television crew at least has like the off-sides camera that is like,
[07:45.200 --> 07:50.200]  showing exactly where the player was with like computer renderings and stuff.
[07:50.200 --> 07:57.200]  So I mean, it's not as if the game has, is the same that it is played in, you know, a desert or a back alley or something.
[07:57.200 --> 08:01.200]  Like the game, the world cup games are, are professional level.
[08:01.200 --> 08:03.200]  We can use a stopwatch properly.
[08:03.200 --> 08:05.200]  Yeah, I don't, I don't get that.
[08:05.200 --> 08:07.200]  I don't get why they don't run it simple.
[08:07.200 --> 08:10.200]  Just stop, if the ref decides, hey, this is a real injury.
[08:10.200 --> 08:13.200]  I'm blowing my whistle, then there's a timekeeper who hits a red button.
[08:13.200 --> 08:14.200]  Exactly.
[08:14.200 --> 08:16.200]  And then when he blows his whistle again, they hit the red button again.
[08:16.200 --> 08:19.200]  And then it's 90 minutes and it's 90 minutes.
[08:19.200 --> 08:20.200]  Right.
[08:20.200 --> 08:24.200]  And at 900, 00, a buzzer goes off and the game is over.
[08:24.200 --> 08:25.200]  Right.
[08:25.200 --> 08:30.200]  Because there's also the weird thing at the end, you know,
[08:30.200 --> 08:35.200]  and, you know, it was almost, almost got to that point in the US Portugal match where
[08:35.200 --> 08:38.200]  there is no automatic buzzer that goes off.
[08:38.200 --> 08:39.200]  Right.
[08:39.200 --> 08:40.200]  It's up to the rest of the whistle.
[08:40.200 --> 08:45.200]  And if the team is down by one goal and streaming down the sideline and play,
[08:45.200 --> 08:48.200]  right, that bothers me as an American.
[08:48.200 --> 08:51.200]  Just, just logically, like as a nerd, it's annoying.
[08:51.200 --> 08:54.200]  Like this, this nebulous nature of the clock.
[08:54.200 --> 08:55.200]  Right.
[08:55.200 --> 08:56.200]  Yeah.
[08:56.200 --> 08:58.200]  Whereas I love, I do love.
[08:58.200 --> 09:04.200]  And our mutual friend, and he's been slowly getting me more into the game over the
[09:04.200 --> 09:05.200]  years.
[09:05.200 --> 09:10.200]  Guy English is big, you know, grew up in, I don't know, some kind of soccer playing
[09:10.200 --> 09:15.200]  country, has been preaching to me that it's a beautiful, you know, that it's the beautiful
[09:15.200 --> 09:16.200]  game and that there's aspects.
[09:16.200 --> 09:18.200]  And there's parts of it that I am getting more into.
[09:18.200 --> 09:25.200]  But I do love, I love the fact that it's a running clock, that it's, you know, they start
[09:25.200 --> 09:26.200]  a half.
[09:26.200 --> 09:29.200]  And for the next 45 minutes, you're just watching these guys play.
[09:29.200 --> 09:32.200]  Well, I mean, that's the great aspect of it, that there's no commercials like cutting
[09:32.200 --> 09:34.200]  into the game.
[09:34.200 --> 09:35.200]  Right.
[09:35.200 --> 09:36.200]  Just a half time full of commercials.
[09:36.200 --> 09:37.200]  Right.
[09:37.200 --> 09:38.200]  And then they, you know, and it's funny.
[09:38.200 --> 09:43.200]  It's like the nature of the, it's just like the web and anything else.
[09:43.200 --> 09:48.200]  If you want to sell ads, the nature of the opportunity, the, the advertisers will find
[09:48.200 --> 09:49.200]  a way.
[09:49.200 --> 09:51.200]  Oh, I mean, so they have those sponsorships along the sidelines.
[09:51.200 --> 09:54.200]  Which are like way worse than the boards in hockey or way more noticeable.
[09:54.200 --> 09:57.200]  And yeah, but it's way better than commercial break.
[09:57.200 --> 09:58.200]  No, no, absolutely.
[09:58.200 --> 09:59.200]  Absolutely.
[09:59.200 --> 10:01.200]  Well, but I think, I don't know how much.
[10:01.200 --> 10:04.200]  I think that's part of the issue with soccer in America is that I think there's not nearly
[10:04.200 --> 10:09.200]  as much money in it, even with all those ads, because it just doesn't ever total up
[10:09.200 --> 10:12.200]  to as much as you would make from selling a few commercial ads like video.
[10:12.200 --> 10:16.200]  Yeah, but somehow the Premier League in Europe makes tons of money and that they can afford
[10:16.200 --> 10:17.200]  to pay guys.
[10:17.200 --> 10:22.200]  You know, it's, it's commensurate with US, you know, professional sports in terms of the
[10:22.200 --> 10:24.200]  top player salary is the value of the franchise.
[10:24.200 --> 10:25.200]  Yeah, I think so.
[10:25.200 --> 10:28.200]  Well, I mean, they all come like Beckham came here to make his money.
[10:28.200 --> 10:33.200]  I'm sure he made some of my, but yeah, but he's sort of like, you know, he's like an
[10:33.200 --> 10:38.200]  A-Rod type where it's, and I don't mean that to be disparaging to him, but, but where
[10:38.200 --> 10:42.200]  his celebrity far extended beyond sports.
[10:42.200 --> 10:43.200]  Yeah, okay.
[10:43.200 --> 10:48.200]  You know, that he had opportunities that were beyond just his soccer playing ability.
[10:48.200 --> 10:49.200]  Well, I don't know.
[10:49.200 --> 10:50.200]  I didn't do any research.
[10:50.200 --> 10:55.200]  Yeah, we should really talk more about soccer on your tech podcast with both of us that don't
[10:55.200 --> 10:56.200]  really like soccer.
[10:56.200 --> 10:57.200]  The fans are going to love that.
[10:57.200 --> 11:00.700]  Well, but the thing that to me is interesting though, in terms of like the advertising
[11:00.700 --> 11:04.200]  finding a way is that in the Premier League, the teams are sponsored.
[11:04.200 --> 11:09.200]  Right, and their jerseys are like, they have ads on their jerseys, don't they?
[11:09.200 --> 11:10.200]  Right.
[11:10.200 --> 11:12.200]  I forget which team is which, but I know that I watched a man.
[11:12.200 --> 11:15.200]  I don't know how I got tricked into watching the Premier League match a couple months ago.
[11:15.200 --> 11:21.200]  And the one had the Emirates, the airlines are big because they're international and that
[11:21.200 --> 11:25.200]  they, you know, the international appeal of it is, you know, makes it a perfect opportunity.
[11:25.200 --> 11:26.200]  Right.
[11:26.200 --> 11:29.600]  And they just have a, instead of having the team name on the jersey, it's a big airline logo
[11:29.600 --> 11:33.200]  on the jersey, which would, you know, to an American is crazy.
[11:33.200 --> 11:37.200]  I mean, if the Red Sox or the Yankees had a, had a big logo, somebody, some of their
[11:37.200 --> 11:39.200]  companies logo would be discussed.
[11:39.200 --> 11:42.200]  The Yankees, the Yankees don't even put their player names on the jersey.
[11:42.200 --> 11:43.200]  That's right.
[11:43.200 --> 11:46.200]  Derek Jeter's jersey just says two.
[11:46.200 --> 11:48.200]  That's all the way, Jersey, right.
[11:48.200 --> 11:49.200]  Right.
[11:49.200 --> 11:50.200]  It just says two.
[11:50.200 --> 11:51.200]  It's his number.
[11:51.200 --> 11:52.200]  That's all it says.
[11:52.200 --> 11:56.200]  I can't even imagine if it had like a big Pepsi logo.
[11:56.200 --> 12:01.200]  But that's the opportunity in the nature of the game such as that there aren't any breaks.
[12:01.200 --> 12:02.200]  Right.
[12:02.200 --> 12:05.200]  And so I do like that.
[12:05.200 --> 12:10.200]  I like that you can kind of just say, okay, I want to watch the US play somebody and you
[12:10.200 --> 12:14.200]  know, you only have to give up like, you know, it's exactly two hours.
[12:14.200 --> 12:15.200]  Yeah, exactly.
[12:15.200 --> 12:16.200]  Right.
[12:16.200 --> 12:18.200]  And, and it just flows.
[12:18.200 --> 12:19.200]  I like that.
[12:19.200 --> 12:21.200]  Anyway, let's make a prediction.
[12:21.200 --> 12:23.200]  You think the US is going to make it into the elimination?
[12:23.200 --> 12:24.200]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[12:24.200 --> 12:29.200]  The only reason I'm watching it all is because I have a, a pool going with some friends.
[12:29.200 --> 12:33.200]  Who's prize is a London Donovan World Cup, Jersey.
[12:33.200 --> 12:36.200]  Wait, is that for the loser or the winner?
[12:36.200 --> 12:37.200]  The winner for the winner.
[12:37.200 --> 12:42.200]  They must have printed these jerseys up before he was not for the team.
[12:42.200 --> 12:46.200]  So we found this on eBay and that's, that's going to be the prize for the winner.
[12:46.200 --> 12:49.200]  But, so I have them losing.
[12:49.200 --> 12:51.200]  I have, I had Germany in Portugal advancing.
[12:51.200 --> 12:53.200]  So, I don't know.
[12:53.200 --> 12:55.200]  I mean, they played well against Portugal.
[12:55.200 --> 12:56.200]  They could have won that game.
[12:56.200 --> 12:57.200]  So, sure.
[12:57.200 --> 12:59.200]  You don't want that game.
[12:59.200 --> 13:00.200]  I've got Brazil winning the whole thing though.
[13:00.200 --> 13:01.200]  I go hometown.
[13:01.200 --> 13:03.200]  I go, you know, one of the best soccer teams.
[13:03.200 --> 13:05.200]  Yeah, and eventually the refs are going to fix it for them.
[13:05.200 --> 13:07.200]  That'll be some kind of match.
[13:07.200 --> 13:09.200]  And, you know, there'll be a terrible handball.
[13:09.200 --> 13:12.200]  Have you noticed the, I don't know how much of the commercials you've seen,
[13:12.200 --> 13:14.200]  because there are some during the half.
[13:14.200 --> 13:20.200]  But there's a FIFA ad that is a soccer ball like rolling on a field and the field tilts.
[13:20.200 --> 13:21.200]  Have you seen this?
[13:21.200 --> 13:22.200]  No.
[13:22.200 --> 13:26.200]  The short, the, just, the gist of it is, is that it's, it's a FIFA ad and it says,
[13:26.200 --> 13:28.200]  together we fight match manipulation.
[13:28.200 --> 13:36.200]  And it's absurd that you need an ad to tell the fans like we're fighting against corruption in soccer.
[13:36.200 --> 13:37.200]  Right.
[13:37.200 --> 13:39.200]  Well, did you see that New York Times story a couple of weeks ago?
[13:39.200 --> 13:42.200]  About the previous South Africa, right?
[13:42.200 --> 13:43.200]  Yeah.
[13:43.200 --> 13:45.200]  And that the, you know, the one, the one FIFA ref, you know,
[13:45.200 --> 13:49.200]  just took like a cash deposit of $120,000 to the bank with it.
[13:49.200 --> 13:52.200]  And then like six hours later was reffing a match.
[13:52.200 --> 13:53.200]  Right.
[13:53.200 --> 13:55.200]  Making suspicious calls.
[13:55.200 --> 13:59.200]  Yeah, no, no attempt to hide it even.
[13:59.200 --> 14:03.200]  I mean, the whole, yeah, the whole thing is crooked.
[14:03.200 --> 14:04.200]  Yeah.
[14:04.200 --> 14:10.200]  And well, and that it's, it stems from the fact that they pick the referees via international diplomacy,
[14:10.200 --> 14:14.200]  where it's, hey, we need a guy from this part of the, the current world,
[14:14.200 --> 14:18.200]  this guy, part of the world, this part of the world as opposed to ranking them.
[14:18.200 --> 14:20.200]  Like these are the best refs.
[14:20.200 --> 14:21.200]  Right.
[14:21.200 --> 14:27.200]  Which is how US sports typically are done, like in the NFL, for the playoff games,
[14:27.200 --> 14:32.200]  there's like a systematic analysis of which referees for the most accurate in a regular season,
[14:32.200 --> 14:36.200]  and those refs get to ref playoff games.
[14:36.200 --> 14:38.200]  And it's, I think it's the same in baseball.
[14:38.200 --> 14:41.200]  I think that there's like, definitely the veteran teams at least.
[14:41.200 --> 14:45.200]  I don't know if it's, but if you're a veteran team, it's because you've done well over the years.
[14:45.200 --> 14:46.200]  Right.
[14:46.200 --> 14:50.200]  And one thing you could definitely say for Major League Baseball is for all the problems
[14:50.200 --> 14:52.200]  that, that they've had over the decade.
[14:52.200 --> 14:58.200]  One thing is that there's never really been any kind of even hint or, or with of implication of
[14:58.200 --> 14:59.200]  the offense.
[14:59.200 --> 15:00.200]  Yeah.
[15:00.200 --> 15:01.200]  Yeah.
[15:01.200 --> 15:06.200]  There's vampires you can complain about, but it's never in terms of bias or, uh, fixing matches or.
[15:06.200 --> 15:07.200]  No.
[15:07.200 --> 15:09.200]  You just think they're inconsistent with their strike zone or.
[15:09.200 --> 15:10.200]  Right.
[15:10.200 --> 15:12.200]  Just allows the umpire, but never a great umpire.
[15:12.200 --> 15:13.200]  Right.
[15:13.200 --> 15:19.200]  They had, they truly have an impeccable, you know, 100, you know, century long reputation for, uh,
[15:19.200 --> 15:20.200]  uncorruptibility.
[15:20.200 --> 15:21.200]  Yeah.
[15:21.200 --> 15:22.200]  Yeah.
[15:22.200 --> 15:23.200]  Being impartial.
[15:23.200 --> 15:24.200]  Yeah.
[15:24.200 --> 15:27.200]  And you take that for kind of when you hear what.
[15:27.200 --> 15:28.200]  Right.
[15:28.200 --> 15:29.200]  Right.
[15:29.200 --> 15:30.200]  Has to put an ad on.
[15:30.200 --> 15:33.200]  It says we're trying to keep this fair.
[15:33.200 --> 15:36.200]  Oh man, soccer.
[15:36.200 --> 15:37.200]  Let's move on.
[15:37.200 --> 15:42.200]  I said ahead of time that I wasn't going to get into it and I'm not into it, but I'm still
[15:42.200 --> 15:43.200]  watching it.
[15:43.200 --> 15:45.200]  And I don't want to talk about it.
[15:45.200 --> 15:46.200]  All right.
[15:46.200 --> 15:47.200]  One last thing.
[15:47.200 --> 15:49.200]  Thank God they got rid of those goddamn noise make.
[15:49.200 --> 15:50.200]  Oh, the voo is aless.
[15:50.200 --> 15:51.200]  Yeah.
[15:51.200 --> 15:56.000]  Remember, I don't want to, you, you can cut this, but, uh, those were great for our company
[15:56.000 --> 16:01.000]  because, uh, there was a plugin called voo voo X, and it was an audio plugin that let you
[16:01.000 --> 16:05.200]  cut out the sound of voo was aless and audio hijack pro worked with this plugin.
[16:05.200 --> 16:09.600]  So people were, were using audio hijack pro in this plugin to, uh, to remove the, the,
[16:09.600 --> 16:11.800]  the buzzing noise from the background.
[16:11.800 --> 16:13.200]  No, there's no reason to cut it.
[16:13.200 --> 16:14.200]  I don't mind.
[16:14.200 --> 16:17.000]  Well, when you were watching the matches, it was, if you could get wrapped.
[16:17.000 --> 16:18.000]  It was fantastic.
[16:18.000 --> 16:19.000]  Oh.
[16:19.000 --> 16:22.000]  A voo, say, a d, a d voo voo, say, a plugin.
[16:22.000 --> 16:23.000]  Yeah.
[16:23.000 --> 16:24.000]  Voo voo X.
[16:24.000 --> 16:25.000]  That's fantastic.
[16:25.000 --> 16:26.000]  That's good.
[16:26.000 --> 16:29.500]  You know, it was so annoying that it doesn't surprise me in the least that somebody took
[16:29.500 --> 16:30.500]  the time to write it.
[16:30.500 --> 16:31.500]  Get rid of it.
[16:31.500 --> 16:32.500]  Yeah.
[16:32.500 --> 16:33.500]  Well, but I mean, that was like an African thing.
[16:33.500 --> 16:35.200]  So I guess, you know, they don't have that in Brazil.
[16:35.200 --> 16:37.000]  I don't know what they have there, but nothing quite.
[16:37.000 --> 16:38.500]  Well, they've apparently banned it though.
[16:38.500 --> 16:39.500]  Oh, did they really?
[16:39.500 --> 16:43.000]  Yeah, that you, you know, that they were telling you as you come into the stadium that
[16:43.000 --> 16:46.000]  if you're caught with one, you're going to get kicked out.
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  Go.
[17:10.000 --> 17:12.000]  Well, I like what you've done with the place.
[17:12.000 --> 17:14.000]  The studio here, it's slim down.
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  It's sparse.
[17:16.000 --> 17:17.000]  I, you've changed it up a little bit.
[17:17.000 --> 17:20.000]  The set looks different.
[17:20.000 --> 17:26.000]  I was looking at the, the talk show page now versus, I think I was on some time last year.
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  You got rid of the wood paneling.
[17:28.000 --> 17:29.000]  Yeah.
[17:29.000 --> 17:32.000]  You got rid of the, uh, skill morphism, if you will.
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  You toned it down to a flat gray.
[17:34.000 --> 17:35.000]  Thank you.
[17:35.000 --> 17:36.000]  Very nice.
[17:36.000 --> 17:39.000]  Did you see this where FAA, I just sent you this link.
[17:39.000 --> 17:43.000]  There's late breaking news before we started recording that the FAA is, uh, put the
[17:43.000 --> 17:46.000]  next on Amazon's drone delivery plans.
[17:46.000 --> 17:49.000]  Well, which didn't, I mean, the drones didn't exist anyway.
[17:49.000 --> 17:52.000]  Or, you know, it's, it's not as if this was like they're in the air right now
[17:52.000 --> 17:55.000]  and they're calling them back because of this band.
[17:55.000 --> 17:56.000]  All right.
[17:56.000 --> 17:57.000]  Uh, you know, I read that article.
[17:57.000 --> 18:02.000]  It, uh, it indicated that this was something that the FAA had already
[18:02.000 --> 18:05.000]  attempted to band, right?
[18:05.000 --> 18:07.000]  I guess so.
[18:07.000 --> 18:11.000]  It occurred to me when Amazon announced this was a month ago, was it last year?
[18:11.000 --> 18:14.000]  I don't know when it was on.
[18:14.000 --> 18:19.000]  It occurred to me that it just seems like, well, this, it's a cool idea.
[18:19.000 --> 18:23.000]  And I could see how in the future this, you know, this, this could be a thing,
[18:23.000 --> 18:27.000]  but it's got to be, there's, there's got to be some regulatory structure here.
[18:27.000 --> 18:31.000]  We, you can't just have anybody who wants to willy-nilly flying.
[18:31.000 --> 18:32.000]  Right.
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.000]  Especially pro-peller driven.
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  Little, yeah, right.
[18:38.000 --> 18:43.000]  Uh, well, I mean, even when they announced it, they said this was, I mean, they announced it and it made a big,
[18:43.000 --> 18:48.000]  you know, it got a big PR, uh, cry and, and that was what they wanted.
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  But it wasn't as if they announced it like coming in six months.
[18:50.000 --> 18:53.000]  They said this is coming in several years.
[18:53.000 --> 18:59.000]  Uh, once we deal with the FAA and, uh, so this, this story now doesn't really,
[18:59.000 --> 19:03.000]  I don't think it really changes anything for Amazon.
[19:03.000 --> 19:06.000]  It just sort of clarifies that no, you cannot just start doing it right.
[19:06.000 --> 19:07.000]  Right.
[19:07.000 --> 19:08.000]  It's not, it's not happening next week.
[19:08.000 --> 19:13.000]  Uh, you're not, you're not getting drone deliveries within the next few months at least.
[19:13.000 --> 19:19.000]  It just fits to me though with like, um, into a lesser degree at Amazon, but, you know,
[19:19.000 --> 19:25.000]  it's Google's MO to me is to just announce crazy shit that's not even close to being real
[19:25.000 --> 19:28.000]  and get people all excited about it.
[19:28.000 --> 19:34.000]  And to me, it just distracts from the best of what's really real.
[19:34.000 --> 19:35.000]  Right.
[19:35.000 --> 19:36.000]  And being announced today.
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.000]  But for Amazon, I think it's probably actually pretty effective because it says, oh,
[19:40.000 --> 19:44.000]  they're really focused on delivery and even if they can't do this yet, I should still buy stuff from them.
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  Because it was only, it was an ancillary thing.
[19:46.000 --> 19:50.000]  It wasn't as if, I mean, probably some people would have ordered stuff just to get a drone
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.000]  to deliver it to them.
[19:51.000 --> 19:52.000]  I probably would have.
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  But yeah, I would do that.
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  But I mean, it wasn't as if they said, you know, this is the service.
[19:56.000 --> 20:01.000]  They said, you know, we're working to make shipping on what you buy as fast as possible.
[20:01.000 --> 20:05.000]  So it's not as if they were actually selling the drone delivery.
[20:05.000 --> 20:06.000]  Because I think you're right.
[20:06.000 --> 20:10.000]  In terms of Google, there's a lot of stuff that they pre-announced or announced when it's,
[20:10.000 --> 20:12.000]  you know, sort of half baked.
[20:12.000 --> 20:15.000]  And it's something that you might actually want to buy directly.
[20:15.000 --> 20:21.000]  But either it's not available like Google Glass has been, this year they've had a couple
[20:21.000 --> 20:23.000]  like anyone can buy it days, right?
[20:23.000 --> 20:24.000]  Yeah.
[20:24.000 --> 20:25.000]  But for the most part, it's still 15.
[20:25.000 --> 20:28.000]  It's 1500 bucks, which is much more than they planned charge for it.
[20:28.000 --> 20:32.000]  And for the most part, it's just been available to select developers.
[20:32.000 --> 20:37.000]  So it's something that's in the public consciousness, but not actually available to the public.
[20:37.000 --> 20:42.000]  So, you know, and we're recording this a day, I think one day before the Google IO keynote.
[20:42.000 --> 20:47.000]  It could be, you know, by the day or two from now, there's a big new Google Glass announcement
[20:47.000 --> 20:52.000]  where either A, they've radically dropped the price or B, they've got a new generational hardware
[20:52.000 --> 20:56.000]  that's less obtrusive and significantly improved who knows.
[20:56.000 --> 20:57.000]  But I don't really expect.
[20:57.000 --> 21:02.000]  Well, but even if they, even if that's true and it may well be, but, you know, it's been what,
[21:02.000 --> 21:07.000]  a year at least, a year plus since it first has landed in people's years.
[21:07.000 --> 21:08.000]  Two years.
[21:08.000 --> 21:09.000]  Yeah, two years, right?
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.000]  And, you know, it just, it doesn't really exist as a product.
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  It's not a product you can go into the store and buy.
[21:14.000 --> 21:15.000]  No.
[21:15.000 --> 21:16.000]  And that's strange to me.
[21:16.000 --> 21:20.000]  And I think your comparison is generally going to be the Apple where you don't hear anything
[21:20.000 --> 21:25.000]  about it until it's either in the stores or it's going to be in the stores very soon.
[21:25.000 --> 21:28.000]  And in a form that is exactly as promised.
[21:28.000 --> 21:29.000]  Right.
[21:29.000 --> 21:30.000]  Like, you know, they did pre-announced the iPhone.
[21:30.000 --> 21:33.000]  I was just going to say the iPhone 5, sort of the exception.
[21:33.000 --> 21:36.000]  But even that, nothing that they pre-announced.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  I mean, was there anything that was missing in the final product?
[21:38.000 --> 21:39.000]  No.
[21:39.000 --> 21:46.000]  In fact, it was better because they switched from plastic to Gorilla Glass, like a month before him.
[21:46.000 --> 21:51.000]  Which to me, it's one of those like secret, like little overlooked historical things where it's like,
[21:51.000 --> 21:57.000]  can you even imagine being Tim Cook and it's like, you're trying to get this super high profile thing shipped
[21:57.000 --> 22:02.000]  and from China and like Steve Jobs comes in, I was like, hey, he's plastic's no good.
[22:02.000 --> 22:06.000]  I've got these guys from Corning on the phone, and I think we can switch to Glass.
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  And it's like May.
[22:08.000 --> 22:09.000]  Right.
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  It's like six weeks before you're supposed to ship the thing.
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  And somehow he made it happen.
[22:13.000 --> 22:14.000]  Was it that?
[22:14.000 --> 22:15.000]  I mean, do you, I don't know.
[22:15.000 --> 22:18.000]  I mean, even if it was six months, even if it was six months, it's ridiculous.
[22:18.000 --> 22:21.000]  Well, it was definitely after January, you know.
[22:21.000 --> 22:24.000]  I think that one of the books might have had that.
[22:24.000 --> 22:27.000]  Maybe like the jobs biography had this story.
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  Maybe it was like April or something like that.
[22:29.000 --> 22:32.000]  But like you said, it doesn't, at any point between January and June.
[22:32.000 --> 22:33.000]  Right.
[22:33.000 --> 22:34.000]  It's been finalized.
[22:34.000 --> 22:35.000]  Right.
[22:35.000 --> 22:38.000]  And it was like the most important part of the phone.
[22:38.000 --> 22:41.000]  It was the thing that was most different and original and new.
[22:41.000 --> 22:44.000]  And they switched from plastic, hard plastic to Gorilla Glass.
[22:44.000 --> 22:45.000]  Right.
[22:45.000 --> 22:48.000]  And the apps got better in some ways.
[22:48.000 --> 22:49.000]  Right.
[22:49.000 --> 22:50.000]  I forget there were a couple of days.
[22:50.000 --> 22:51.000]  It was better than promised, though.
[22:51.000 --> 22:55.000]  And then two months after that, when they dropped the price, it even came down in price.
[22:55.000 --> 22:56.000]  Right.
[22:56.000 --> 22:56.000]  Right.
[22:56.000 --> 23:01.000]  So yeah, by in that first generation, it wound up being better than they had originally promised,
[23:01.000 --> 23:06.000]  which is something they never do anyway, as far as originally announcing something before it's available.
[23:06.000 --> 23:07.000]  Right.
[23:07.000 --> 23:12.000]  Like whereas the opposite would have been if they promised it was going to be Gorilla Glass.
[23:12.000 --> 23:17.000]  And promised it was going to be $3.99, and then they shipped it, and it was scratchable plastic and $6.99.
[23:17.000 --> 23:18.000]  Right.
[23:18.000 --> 23:19.000]  Right.
[23:19.000 --> 23:20.000]  Right.
[23:20.000 --> 23:32.000]  And well, and I'll also remind you of this, showing these concepts and sort of conflating between the concepts and reality with this thing I saw over the weekend and linked up about...
[23:32.000 --> 23:33.000]  No, the armband?
[23:33.000 --> 23:34.000]  Google gesture.
[23:34.000 --> 23:35.000]  Right.
[23:35.000 --> 23:41.000]  It was this video and mashable, linked it up as it was real, and then a couple of Android sites picked it up after Mashable.
[23:41.000 --> 23:49.000]  And what it really was, was just a student exercise from, I forget, some advertising school and stockable.
[23:49.000 --> 23:50.000]  And you're up for 30, right?
[23:50.000 --> 23:51.000]  Yeah.
[23:51.000 --> 23:52.000]  Yeah.
[23:52.000 --> 23:53.000]  I think it was Stockholm.
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  And it broke school of communication.
[23:55.000 --> 24:02.000]  And it was a bunch of students who made a video of a fake Google product called Google gesture where you'd put this armband on.
[24:02.000 --> 24:07.000]  And it would translate sign language to verbal speech in real time.
[24:07.000 --> 24:08.000]  Right.
[24:08.000 --> 24:17.000]  Which is a little fantastic given that it doesn't, you know, Google has great text to speech.
[24:17.000 --> 24:27.000]  You know, and speech to text, but it still isn't quite as real time as what they were showing for this armband for sign language.
[24:27.000 --> 24:30.000]  All it was though, it had nothing to do with Google.
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  They're not engineering students.
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  They're not working with, it's not like a computer science project.
[24:34.000 --> 24:35.000]  They're advertising.
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.000]  Right.
[24:36.000 --> 24:42.000]  And it was just an exercise to say like make a fantastic product and then make an ad for it.
[24:42.000 --> 24:43.000]  Right.
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.000]  But Mashable went with it as though it was real and posted other sites.
[24:46.000 --> 24:50.000]  And I feel like, you know, shame on them for not looking at it a little harder.
[24:50.000 --> 24:53.000]  The signs were all there that this was not real.
[24:53.000 --> 25:01.000]  But it's still to me is a little telling now that they got fooled because it's, you know, Google tends to announce stuff that's not really at.
[25:01.000 --> 25:02.000]  Right.
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.000]  What was the last sentence was no shipping date for the app has been announced yet.
[25:06.000 --> 25:09.000]  In the, in the Mashable, yeah, in the Mashable piece, right?
[25:09.000 --> 25:10.000]  Right.
[25:10.000 --> 25:11.000]  Well, I don't know.
[25:11.000 --> 25:19.000]  That, I mean, that happens with, it doesn't happen in the same way with Apple, but there's all sorts of writing about Apple about the eye watch that's coming.
[25:19.000 --> 25:24.000]  And it's written as if this is a certainty and as if Apple has already announced it.
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  And it drives me crazy.
[25:26.000 --> 25:27.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[25:27.000 --> 25:32.000]  Because, well, and I think I brought it up with Mark German a couple weeks ago when he was on the show.
[25:32.000 --> 25:37.000]  The thing that gets me is the way those articles are always accompanied by visual mock-ups.
[25:37.000 --> 25:42.000]  From some random, you know, designer on Flickr or Dribble or wherever.
[25:42.000 --> 25:43.000]  Right.
[25:43.000 --> 25:54.000]  And, and there's a tiny little credit to like a name, but it doesn't really say it never says this is just a crazy mock-up that is unrelated to the rumor that I were published.
[25:54.000 --> 26:00.000]  It goes well with the story, but don't take it as, as fact or even as, as anything, yeah.
[26:00.000 --> 26:03.000]  In fact, there was one a couple of weeks ago.
[26:03.000 --> 26:07.000]  It doesn't really matter which site it was, but it was one of these sites like nine to five Mac.
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  And it wasn't a Mark German story of somebody out, but it might have been nine to five Mac.
[26:10.000 --> 26:16.000]  Might have been somebody else, but it was a story about, or maybe it was a German.
[26:16.000 --> 26:31.000]  I don't know, it doesn't matter, but it was about this thing where that iOS 8 is rumored to be like in the fall when new iPads come out that there's going to be split screen mode between multiple apps, two apps.
[26:31.000 --> 26:34.000]  It was this before the developer's conference or after?
[26:34.000 --> 26:35.000]  After.
[26:35.000 --> 26:35.000]  Okay.
[26:35.000 --> 26:40.000]  So before the subject rumor, but then they didn't mention that the conference, so we're assuming it's not happening.
[26:40.000 --> 26:41.000]  Right.
[26:41.000 --> 26:52.000]  And somebody had poking around the iOS 8 beta had found some stuff that's in there that suggests, yeah, there's these, you know,
[26:52.000 --> 27:02.000]  we can actually come back to this later in the show, but these, you know, different screen modes like two thirds, one third, one half, one half.
[27:02.000 --> 27:11.000]  And so this article was describing what's actually in the iOS beta hidden, which isn't much.
[27:11.000 --> 27:18.000]  We still don't really know like the actual interactive like what is actually, how are you going to invoke it and drag it along and stuff like that.
[27:18.000 --> 27:25.000]  And in meantime, they had an illustration showing something completely from like somebody from months ago, just speculate.
[27:25.000 --> 27:31.000]  When the rumor first came out or right, it didn't even match what was being described.
[27:31.000 --> 27:40.000]  But yet was done in a very highly detailed visual style that conveys a sense of authority and of reality as if this is real.
[27:40.000 --> 27:41.000]  Right.
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.000]  Like it would be different.
[27:42.000 --> 27:43.000]  It would be stupid.
[27:43.000 --> 27:44.000]  They wouldn't do it.
[27:44.000 --> 27:59.000]  But like if somebody who's, you know, not really an artist like me took like a field notes notebook and a pen and just did like a simple sketch on artistic, just a pen on paper and said it's sort of like this, right, a couple of rectangles in an arrow.
[27:59.000 --> 28:04.000]  That would be one thing, but it's these completely fleshed down ideas.
[28:04.000 --> 28:09.000]  Yeah, like 100% articulated in Photoshop idea, you know, and it drives me nuts.
[28:09.000 --> 28:16.000]  You know, every, and you can just, you can find hundreds of these stories about like the iWatch that are accompanied by these illustrations.
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  Makes me crazy.
[28:18.000 --> 28:21.000]  Let me tell you about, take a break, talk about our first sponsor.
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  Happy to say, I always love to say this.
[28:23.000 --> 28:28.000]  I think pretty sure a new sponsor never before sponsored the talk show.
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  It's a company called Squarespace.
[28:31.000 --> 28:37.000]  Squarespace, I've not heard of them.
[28:37.000 --> 28:38.000]  Go ahead.
[28:38.000 --> 28:39.000]  All right.
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.000]  This is a fantastic company.
[28:40.000 --> 28:41.000]  You're going to love this.
[28:41.000 --> 28:42.000]  You got to hear this.
[28:42.000 --> 28:43.000]  Here's the thing.
[28:43.000 --> 28:49.000]  Squarespace is an all in one website building and hosting service.
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  So you need a website.
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.000]  Easy.
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  Go to squarespace.com.
[28:54.000 --> 29:01.000]  You sign up and they have an all in one platform, makes it fast and easy to create a very, very professional website.
[29:01.000 --> 29:03.000]  And it could be any sort of website.
[29:03.000 --> 29:06.000]  They have all sorts of templates for pre-existing ideas.
[29:06.000 --> 29:13.000]  Like a portfolio site, if you're an artist who wants to show off your work, an online store, if you have stuff to sell.
[29:13.000 --> 29:20.000]  And they take care of all the really hard stuff of online commerce for you, all just baked into your account.
[29:20.000 --> 29:27.000]  It's simple and easy, beautiful design, drag and drop content to rearrange it just the way you want.
[29:27.000 --> 29:35.000]  If you want, you can drop down and adjust it at the code level if you want to inject your own JavaScript or adjust the CSS or something like that.
[29:35.000 --> 29:43.000]  But if you don't know JavaScript or you don't know CSS, you can do the whole thing through drag and drop in a very visual intuitive way.
[29:43.000 --> 29:44.000]  And it all just works.
[29:44.000 --> 29:51.000]  Now, plans start at just eight bucks a month and include a free domain name if you sign up for a year.
[29:51.000 --> 30:02.000]  They have 24-7 tech support and live chat, live chat and email tech support located in New York City, Dublin and now Portland.
[30:02.000 --> 30:05.000]  I'm assuming that's Portland, Oregon.
[30:05.000 --> 30:08.000]  Could be Portland, Maine, that's fine city, but I'm going to guess it's true.
[30:08.000 --> 30:10.000]  Probably want the different times out, though.
[30:10.000 --> 30:12.000]  Yeah, probably want the different times out.
[30:12.000 --> 30:20.000]  Responsive design, everything they do looks great from phones to tablets to big 30-inch cinema this place.
[30:20.000 --> 30:24.000]  You can start a trial with no credit card required.
[30:24.000 --> 30:28.000]  You don't have to give them a credit card first and then cancel it if you decide to do it.
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.000]  You can start with no credit card and start building your website today.
[30:31.000 --> 30:32.000]  So here's what you do.
[30:32.000 --> 30:41.000]  Go to squarespace.com slash Gruber and you can use the offer code, JG, just my initials.
[30:41.000 --> 30:46.000]  John Gruber, JG, and you'll save 10% off your first purchase.
[30:46.000 --> 30:47.000]  So sign up for a year.
[30:47.000 --> 30:52.000]  You'll get the free domain name and the 10% will be a big discount.
[30:52.000 --> 30:54.000]  And that way they'll know you're coming from the talk show.
[30:54.000 --> 30:55.000]  Nine square space.
[30:55.000 --> 31:00.000]  What's interesting is actually if you use an offer code PK, my initials, you get 11% off.
[31:00.000 --> 31:03.000]  So it's up to you which one you want to use.
[31:03.000 --> 31:12.000]  I mean, it sounds like a great idea for a service, I'll bet I'll bet we'll hear from again.
[31:12.000 --> 31:14.000]  Happy to have him as a sponsor.
[31:14.000 --> 31:15.000]  What else?
[31:15.000 --> 31:16.000]  Where were we?
[31:16.000 --> 31:19.000]  We were talking about Amazon.
[31:19.000 --> 31:23.000]  So the last week they announced the Amazon Firephone.
[31:23.000 --> 31:24.000]  Right.
[31:24.000 --> 31:25.000]  Did you see that?
[31:25.000 --> 31:27.000]  I didn't see the event.
[31:27.000 --> 31:30.000]  I saw one of the summaries of it.
[31:30.000 --> 31:32.000]  Did you actually watch the event?
[31:32.000 --> 31:34.000]  No, I didn't.
[31:34.000 --> 31:35.000]  I watched a little bit.
[31:35.000 --> 31:37.000]  And they do seem to do a nice job.
[31:37.000 --> 31:40.000]  But I forget.
[31:40.000 --> 31:42.000]  I was busy at the time.
[31:42.000 --> 31:44.000]  And then I just read all the highlights.
[31:44.000 --> 31:46.000]  It just didn't seem like there was two hours of stuff.
[31:46.000 --> 31:47.000]  Well, right.
[31:47.000 --> 31:49.000]  Because it was just the phone, right?
[31:49.000 --> 31:51.000]  Did they cover anything else?
[31:51.000 --> 31:52.000]  Pretty much.
[31:52.000 --> 31:57.000]  I think they had some boilerplate up front just talking about how many
[31:57.000 --> 31:59.000]  how successful prime is.
[31:59.000 --> 32:03.000]  And they're graphs with no labeled axes.
[32:03.000 --> 32:05.000]  So it's twice as good as it was last year.
[32:05.000 --> 32:07.000]  But who knows what it was last year?
[32:07.000 --> 32:08.000]  All right.
[32:08.000 --> 32:10.000]  Well, I'm only half joking.
[32:10.000 --> 32:13.000]  I took a screenshot of one of the graphs.
[32:13.000 --> 32:16.000]  It showed like total number of prime members over the years.
[32:16.000 --> 32:19.000]  And it's a steeply sloping upwards.
[32:19.000 --> 32:20.000]  Upwards chart.
[32:20.000 --> 32:23.000]  But there's no label on the Y axis.
[32:23.000 --> 32:24.000]  No label.
[32:24.000 --> 32:25.000]  And I only half joking.
[32:25.000 --> 32:28.960]  I asked if Amazon had ever published a graph with a labeled Y
[32:28.960 --> 32:29.960]  axis.
[32:29.960 --> 32:32.960]  All they had that the X axis is labeled in years.
[32:32.960 --> 32:34.960]  Y axis is completely unlabeled.
[32:34.960 --> 32:36.960]  I don't think that they have.
[32:36.960 --> 32:40.960]  And I know that they've never once announced sales figures for
[32:40.960 --> 32:41.960]  any hardware device that they make.
[32:41.960 --> 32:42.960]  Right.
[32:42.960 --> 32:49.960]  For the kindles and the tablets and the TV one they've got now.
[32:49.960 --> 32:53.960]  They're all fire something now, aren't they?
[32:53.960 --> 32:54.960]  Yeah.
[32:54.960 --> 32:55.960]  I think so.
[32:55.960 --> 32:56.960]  Fire TV.
[32:56.960 --> 32:58.960]  Kindle means reader.
[32:58.960 --> 33:02.960]  And fire means like everything else.
[33:02.960 --> 33:03.960]  Like fancier.
[33:03.960 --> 33:06.960]  But except the Kindle Fire is a reader as well.
[33:06.960 --> 33:07.960]  I mean.
[33:07.960 --> 33:08.960]  The phone?
[33:08.960 --> 33:09.960]  No, no.
[33:09.960 --> 33:11.960]  The Kindle Fire tablet.
[33:11.960 --> 33:12.960]  Don't they call it the?
[33:12.960 --> 33:14.960]  Yeah, but it combines Kindle and fire.
[33:14.960 --> 33:15.960]  Right.
[33:15.960 --> 33:16.960]  Yeah.
[33:16.960 --> 33:17.960]  It's Kindle Fire.
[33:17.960 --> 33:18.960]  Right.
[33:18.960 --> 33:19.960]  Yeah, I see what you're saying.
[33:19.960 --> 33:23.960]  Amazon Kindle Fire is a tablet that's a reader and a fire.
[33:23.960 --> 33:25.960]  I guess fire means Android.
[33:25.960 --> 33:26.960]  I don't know.
[33:26.960 --> 33:27.960]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[33:27.960 --> 33:28.960]  I think the...
[33:28.960 --> 33:29.960]  Fire means they're offshoot of Android.
[33:29.960 --> 33:31.960]  Yeah, it's both an reader and the thing.
[33:31.960 --> 33:36.960]  Then the Fire phone is just their Android offshoot for the phone.
[33:36.960 --> 33:42.960]  And then Fire TV is their Android offshoot for watching video and playing games or whatever
[33:42.960 --> 33:43.960]  on your TV.
[33:43.960 --> 33:44.960]  I guess I don't know if they have games.
[33:44.960 --> 33:45.960]  I don't think they do.
[33:45.960 --> 33:46.960]  No, they do.
[33:46.960 --> 33:48.960]  Because that was one of the first ones that shipped with it.
[33:48.960 --> 33:51.960]  You could buy it with a separate controller.
[33:51.960 --> 33:55.960]  And that was where people said like the Apple TV should sell with a...
[33:55.960 --> 33:58.960]  You could buy a $20 controller and then play games on it.
[33:58.960 --> 33:59.960]  And the...
[33:59.960 --> 34:02.960]  The Amazon Fire TV had...
[34:02.960 --> 34:04.960]  I think the default model didn't have a controller,
[34:04.960 --> 34:06.960]  but you could buy an additional controller with it.
[34:06.960 --> 34:08.960]  I don't know if that ever took off.
[34:08.960 --> 34:09.960]  It's only been a few months ago.
[34:09.960 --> 34:10.960]  Yeah, I don't know.
[34:10.960 --> 34:11.960]  Never hear anybody write about it.
[34:11.960 --> 34:12.960]  So maybe it's not that popular.
[34:12.960 --> 34:13.960]  Maybe it is.
[34:13.960 --> 34:14.960]  And they're just not writing about it.
[34:14.960 --> 34:15.960]  But...
[34:15.960 --> 34:16.960]  You know what?
[34:16.960 --> 34:17.960]  That's one of those things too.
[34:17.960 --> 34:22.960]  I know people who follow Apple tend to be accused of...
[34:22.960 --> 34:24.960]  I don't know, favoritism or...
[34:24.960 --> 34:25.960]  Or like in the sport,
[34:25.960 --> 34:28.960]  to go back to the sports analogy that we're always complaining about the refs.
[34:28.960 --> 34:29.960]  Right.
[34:29.960 --> 34:30.960]  Right.
[34:30.960 --> 34:33.960]  We always perceive that the refs are out to get us.
[34:33.960 --> 34:38.960]  But I can't help but think that if Apple had announced at the same time
[34:38.960 --> 34:41.960]  an Apple TV update with a game controller
[34:41.960 --> 34:44.960]  and it had taken off to the extent that Amazon's has taken off,
[34:44.960 --> 34:47.960]  which is to say, apparently not much at all,
[34:47.960 --> 34:50.960]  that they'd be getting excoriated stories about how it was locked.
[34:50.960 --> 34:56.960]  And that Tim Cook would need to be fired and et cetera, et cetera.
[34:56.960 --> 34:58.960]  So better off not to try anything.
[34:58.960 --> 34:59.960]  Well, I don't know.
[34:59.960 --> 35:04.960]  Somehow Apple alone seems to not be given permission by the business press
[35:04.960 --> 35:07.960]  and some of the tech press to just try things.
[35:07.960 --> 35:08.960]  Right.
[35:08.960 --> 35:09.960]  Right.
[35:09.960 --> 35:13.960]  And there's Snide remarks about Apple TV as a quote-unquote hobby
[35:13.960 --> 35:16.960]  where as it's clearly more,
[35:16.960 --> 35:20.960]  and I think by that it just means it's not as big a deal financially
[35:20.960 --> 35:22.960]  as the other things that Apple does, like the phone and that.
[35:22.960 --> 35:24.960]  Well, I mean, that originated.
[35:24.960 --> 35:26.960]  I think it was Tim Cook who said that, wasn't it?
[35:26.960 --> 35:28.960]  Was it jobs, but it came from Apple?
[35:28.960 --> 35:29.960]  Or maybe it started?
[35:29.960 --> 35:32.960]  Well, it came while jobs was still alive.
[35:32.960 --> 35:33.960]  Okay.
[35:33.960 --> 35:35.960]  I don't know if it was his words or Tim Cook's words while
[35:35.960 --> 35:37.960]  but Steve was still this.
[35:37.960 --> 35:38.960]  Right.
[35:38.960 --> 35:39.960]  And yeah.
[35:39.960 --> 35:41.960]  And they said, you know, this is sort of a hobby for us.
[35:41.960 --> 35:44.960]  Yeah, then it becomes the way that the press writes about it.
[35:44.960 --> 35:45.960]  Right.
[35:45.960 --> 35:48.960]  Well, I actually remember when they did the first Apple TV.
[35:48.960 --> 35:49.960]  The silver one.
[35:49.960 --> 35:51.960]  And it was the actual hard drive in it.
[35:51.960 --> 35:52.960]  Yeah.
[35:52.960 --> 35:55.960]  And they even, it was sort of semi-preannounced
[35:55.960 --> 35:57.960]  because they were going to call it ITV.
[35:57.960 --> 35:58.960]  Yeah, it was the same time as the iPhone.
[35:58.960 --> 35:59.960]  Yeah.
[35:59.960 --> 36:02.960]  It was 2007, same in the keynote.
[36:02.960 --> 36:05.960]  Was it really at the end of the iPhone announcement?
[36:05.960 --> 36:05.960]  Yep.
[36:05.960 --> 36:06.960]  It was the same keynote.
[36:06.960 --> 36:09.960]  I'm like 99% certain on that.
[36:09.960 --> 36:10.960]  He was like, I don't even know what we're going to call it.
[36:10.960 --> 36:12.960]  We'll just call it ITV.
[36:12.960 --> 36:13.960]  Well, no, no, no.
[36:13.960 --> 36:15.960]  No, they decided it was the Apple TV.
[36:15.960 --> 36:17.960]  But he kept calling it the ITV because he said, oh, that's why
[36:17.960 --> 36:21.960]  you shouldn't go with a code name that like, I do remember that.
[36:21.960 --> 36:24.960]  It was that internally they had called it the ITV.
[36:24.960 --> 36:25.960]  Yeah.
[36:25.960 --> 36:28.960]  And then one of kept slipping when he was referring to it.
[36:28.960 --> 36:32.960]  Well, the reason that they I've heard that the reason they couldn't use
[36:32.960 --> 36:38.960]  that was because there's a big TV network in BBC called ITV.
[36:38.960 --> 36:41.960]  This wasn't worth it. Like I guess they could maybe use that name elsewhere
[36:41.960 --> 36:44.960]  around the world, but that the UK is big enough to do it.
[36:44.960 --> 36:44.960]  Yeah.
[36:44.960 --> 36:46.960]  Yeah, big enough market not to do it.
[36:46.960 --> 36:48.960]  But anyway, it was introduced as a hobby.
[36:48.960 --> 36:50.960]  It was like, we don't really know what we're doing with this,
[36:50.960 --> 36:54.960]  but we can it's it's it's interesting enough to ship and you can
[36:54.960 --> 36:56.960]  watch movies and TV shows on it and stuff.
[36:56.960 --> 36:57.960]  Right.
[36:57.960 --> 37:00.960]  But I can't help but think that if they had done a game controller already
[37:00.960 --> 37:04.960]  and had games for Apple TV and it was, you know, had gone nowhere.
[37:04.960 --> 37:05.960]  Yeah.
[37:05.960 --> 37:06.960]  You'd be here.
[37:06.960 --> 37:08.960]  Right. You'd hear about it.
[37:08.960 --> 37:09.960]  Well, let's.
[37:09.960 --> 37:10.960]  You wanted to talk.
[37:10.960 --> 37:12.960]  You wanted to talk Tim Cook, right?
[37:12.960 --> 37:13.960]  Sure.
[37:13.960 --> 37:15.960]  Let's segue right to to these.
[37:15.960 --> 37:18.960]  I guess it was just one piece about Tim Cook and then a response piece,
[37:18.960 --> 37:19.960]  right?
[37:19.960 --> 37:20.960]  Right.
[37:20.960 --> 37:22.960]  So there last Sunday, this was,
[37:22.960 --> 37:26.960]  well, it's I guess nine days ago now, but last Sunday there was on the front page
[37:26.960 --> 37:29.960]  and not the front page of the New York Times, but from page of the Sunday
[37:29.960 --> 37:34.960]  business section of the New York Times was a profile of Tim Cook, which
[37:34.960 --> 37:37.960]  interestingly, he did not sit down for.
[37:37.960 --> 37:38.960]  Right.
[37:38.960 --> 37:42.960]  And at one point in the profile, they'd spoke to Apple to verify some things,
[37:42.960 --> 37:45.960]  but they said, you know, Tim Cook, Tim Cook, who declined to be interviewed
[37:45.960 --> 37:48.960]  for this, for this piece.
[37:48.960 --> 37:53.960]  Yeah, but they open it with like an anecdote, a personal anecdote from his
[37:53.960 --> 37:58.960]  childhood, which makes it seem as though he had talked to them for the article,
[37:58.960 --> 38:02.960]  but in fact, they took the anecdote from speech or something that he gave,
[38:02.960 --> 38:07.960]  right, that he gave at Auburn University within the last few years,
[38:07.960 --> 38:11.960]  but then they just sort of, to me, it's a little disingenuous.
[38:11.960 --> 38:13.960]  I mean, the way that it's written.
[38:13.960 --> 38:17.960]  Yeah, the way that it opens anyway, it, it, it relatively quickly admits,
[38:17.960 --> 38:19.960]  you know, we did not interview him directly for this.
[38:19.960 --> 38:22.960]  So it's not as if there's certainly not framing the whole thing as,
[38:22.960 --> 38:26.960]  as if he had spoken to them, but you're right that the, the intro does
[38:26.960 --> 38:29.960]  make it seem a little bit like he was speaking directly to them.
[38:29.960 --> 38:32.960]  Yeah, the headline is Tim Cook making Apple a zone.
[38:32.960 --> 38:34.960]  I'll be sure to put it.
[38:34.960 --> 38:36.960]  I don't, I don't always keep up with the, the show notes,
[38:36.960 --> 38:38.960]  but I'll, I'll make sure I link this in the show notes.
[38:38.960 --> 38:44.960]  It's by Matt Richterl and Brian X Chen, Brian X Chen of, of Japanese
[38:44.960 --> 38:47.960]  hate the iPhone back when he wrote for a while.
[38:47.960 --> 38:49.960]  Right.
[38:49.960 --> 38:51.960]  But the other thing though, that's interesting.
[38:51.960 --> 38:56.960]  So Tim Cook did not speak to them for this profile, but they got a huge
[38:56.960 --> 39:00.960]  interview they did speak to Johnny off.
[39:00.960 --> 39:02.960]  For the same, was it in the same profile?
[39:02.960 --> 39:03.960]  They had spoken to me.
[39:03.960 --> 39:04.960]  Yes.
[39:04.960 --> 39:05.960]  Okay.
[39:05.960 --> 39:06.960]  I guess I didn't, I wrote it late last night.
[39:06.960 --> 39:09.960]  So I guess I didn't, didn't see that that was the, the case.
[39:09.960 --> 39:10.960]  Yeah.
[39:10.960 --> 39:13.960]  So they did get Johnny I've, which if anything is,
[39:13.960 --> 39:14.960]  it's a bigger get you think?
[39:14.960 --> 39:17.960]  Well, I think Tim Cook winds up speaking,
[39:17.960 --> 39:21.960]  certainly doesn't speak a lot to the press, but he speaks more often than
[39:21.960 --> 39:22.960]  Johnny I've does.
[39:22.960 --> 39:27.960]  But so it was Johnny I've speaking almost exclusively about Tim Cook.
[39:27.960 --> 39:32.960]  So it wasn't him talking about his own work or his own, you know,
[39:32.960 --> 39:33.960]  experiences at Apple.
[39:33.960 --> 39:37.960]  It was him sort of buttressing their claims about Tim Cook or, or
[39:37.960 --> 39:40.960]  responding to some of their claims about Tim Cook.
[39:40.960 --> 39:41.960]  Right.
[39:41.960 --> 39:44.960]  You know, Johnny, here's a quote from the article.
[39:44.960 --> 39:48.960]  Johnny I've the head of design at Apple and the name nearly as adored by its followers
[39:48.960 --> 39:50.960]  as Steve Jobs says,
[39:50.960 --> 39:53.960]  the quote has not neglected the company's central mission innovation.
[39:53.960 --> 39:54.960]  Here's the quote.
[39:54.960 --> 39:57.960]  Honestly, I don't think anything's changed.
[39:57.960 --> 40:01.960]  He people felt exactly the same way when we were working on the iPhone.
[40:01.960 --> 40:03.960]  It's hard for all of us to be patient.
[40:03.960 --> 40:04.960]  It was hard for Steve.
[40:04.960 --> 40:06.960]  It is hard for Tim.
[40:06.960 --> 40:08.960]  So I, it's a pretty strong statement.
[40:08.960 --> 40:14.960]  That's Johnny I've putting his personal stamp of approval on the, on the,
[40:14.960 --> 40:15.960]  the Tim Cook era.
[40:15.960 --> 40:16.960]  Yeah.
[40:16.960 --> 40:19.960]  And saying, honestly, I don't think anything's changed.
[40:19.960 --> 40:20.960]  Right.
[40:20.960 --> 40:24.960]  At least with regard to Apple and its, and, you know, the, the i-word innovation.
[40:24.960 --> 40:25.960]  Right.
[40:25.960 --> 40:29.960]  Well, it's interesting that, so yeah, he was, if he was interviewed for part of this,
[40:29.960 --> 40:33.960]  it was really to sort of vouch for Tim Cook.
[40:33.960 --> 40:34.960]  Right.
[40:34.960 --> 40:35.960]  Exactly.
[40:35.960 --> 40:37.960]  Which is if presumably put him forward to do that.
[40:37.960 --> 40:38.960]  Yeah.
[40:38.960 --> 40:42.960]  Because if anything, there's more credibility there than Tim Cook vouching for himself.
[40:42.960 --> 40:43.960]  Right.
[40:43.960 --> 40:44.960]  Absolutely.
[40:44.960 --> 40:45.960]  Right.
[40:45.960 --> 40:47.960]  Take, take these sort of, and I know it's a loaded word objectivity,
[40:47.960 --> 40:55.960]  but take the objective per stance of, okay, forget whether it's Apple and Tim Cook in particular,
[40:55.960 --> 41:06.960]  but a company's CEO and is he, it replaces a very successful predecessor who founded the company.
[41:06.960 --> 41:10.960]  The CEO claims that he himself is doing a good job of placing it.
[41:10.960 --> 41:11.960]  Right.
[41:11.960 --> 41:12.960]  It's almost meaningless.
[41:12.960 --> 41:13.960]  Right.
[41:13.960 --> 41:16.960]  It's, it's not, you know, we laugh, but it's like, well, you know,
[41:16.960 --> 41:17.960]  of course you're going to say it.
[41:17.960 --> 41:17.960]  Right.
[41:17.960 --> 41:18.960]  You'd hope.
[41:18.960 --> 41:19.960]  Right.
[41:19.960 --> 41:26.960]  It means a lot more when somebody who has his own, well, who's there before and who's there now, definitely.
[41:26.960 --> 41:27.960]  Right.
[41:27.960 --> 41:32.960]  And this has, and has earned an enormous amount of credibility.
[41:32.960 --> 41:33.960]  Right.
[41:33.960 --> 41:38.960]  And has credibility to lose an enormous amount of credibility to lose vouches for him.
[41:38.960 --> 41:43.960]  So it's, you know, you could see why Apple PRWise would, would strategize such and say,
[41:43.960 --> 41:47.960]  you know, and assuming that, you know, everybody went along with it, that they would have
[41:47.960 --> 41:48.960]  Johnny speak instead of Tim.
[41:48.960 --> 41:49.960]  Right.
[41:49.960 --> 41:51.960]  Even instead of both.
[41:51.960 --> 41:56.960]  The thing that I thought was interesting was there was a mention of, so right now there's this
[41:56.960 --> 42:02.960]  idea sort of in the ether that Apple hasn't had any innovative product since Steve Jobs died,
[42:02.960 --> 42:03.960]  right?
[42:03.960 --> 42:08.960]  And the last one was the iPad, which was 2010, he died in 2011, is that right?
[42:08.960 --> 42:10.960]  2011, I think.
[42:10.960 --> 42:13.960]  And, you know, they just have, they've been sitting on their hand since then.
[42:13.960 --> 42:20.960]  And, you know, the, the fairly obvious response is that innovative products don't come every six months or
[42:20.960 --> 42:21.960]  every year.
[42:21.960 --> 42:27.960]  It's, you know, the Mac, the iPod in 2001, the iPhone in 2007, and then the iPad in 2010.
[42:27.960 --> 42:32.960]  So even if you think it accelerated, I think that's fairly coincidental and really we're talking
[42:32.960 --> 42:38.960]  about a handful of truly game changing products that you should expect there to be multiple
[42:38.960 --> 42:42.960]  years, maybe even, you know, decades between them.
[42:42.960 --> 42:48.960]  But the iPad mini is sort of the counter to that that maybe that's one where it's at
[42:48.960 --> 42:53.960]  least semi innovative in terms of ramping up sales at least.
[42:53.960 --> 42:57.960]  And what was interesting in that piece was that it said that this was a product that Steve
[42:57.960 --> 42:59.960]  Jobs didn't think would find a market.
[42:59.960 --> 43:03.960]  And since then, it outsells the full size iPad.
[43:03.960 --> 43:07.960]  I don't think it gave a number, but it vastly outsells it, right?
[43:07.960 --> 43:10.960]  I don't know about vastly, but it did say that it outsold it.
[43:10.960 --> 43:15.960]  And I thought that was interesting because it wasn't, it's, Apple doesn't break that down.
[43:15.960 --> 43:18.960]  Although you can kind of extrapolate some of it from average.
[43:18.960 --> 43:23.960]  They do say how many total iPads they sell per quarter and they do give an average selling
[43:23.960 --> 43:27.960]  price and given that the iPad mini has always been significantly lower price.
[43:27.960 --> 43:32.960]  That, you know, you could see from the downward shift in average selling price that it's clearly
[43:32.960 --> 43:33.960]  been.
[43:33.960 --> 43:38.960]  Right.
[43:38.960 --> 43:43.960]  Not just credit, but like credit as far as Steve Jobs didn't want to make this product.
[43:43.960 --> 43:46.960]  And therefore, you know, they didn't under him.
[43:46.960 --> 43:50.960]  And Tim Cook took over and then he said, you know what, we are going to make this.
[43:50.960 --> 43:55.960]  And, you know, that's, that's really, it's never been been promoted that way.
[43:55.960 --> 44:00.960]  But that's, to me, almost really the first major Tim Cook product that,
[44:00.960 --> 44:04.960]  that apparently really just literally would not have happened under Steve Jobs.
[44:04.960 --> 44:05.960]  Right.
[44:05.960 --> 44:10.960]  And it's also a very interesting product to me.
[44:10.960 --> 44:15.960]  Operations wise because I still think it's an enormous, you know,
[44:15.960 --> 44:20.960]  Apple is a company of patterns and you can kind of pick up on the annual patterns
[44:20.960 --> 44:26.960]  of their development and make, you know, without any kind of sources at all at Apple.
[44:26.960 --> 44:30.960]  It's a pretty good guess that there's going to be at least one new iPhone later this year.
[44:30.960 --> 44:34.960]  And it's going to have a new system on a chip called the A8.
[44:34.960 --> 44:35.960]  Right.
[44:35.960 --> 44:36.960]  Right.
[44:36.960 --> 44:38.960]  Well, at the very least, there's going to be a new iPhone.
[44:38.960 --> 44:40.960]  As far as the chip, like what do you think?
[44:40.960 --> 44:42.960]  Like 90% chance on that.
[44:42.960 --> 44:47.960]  I would say at least 90% chance that there's going to be an A8 because there's been an A4,
[44:47.960 --> 44:50.960]  A5, A6, A7 for the last four years.
[44:50.960 --> 44:53.960]  And has it been every 10 years that they've had a new one?
[44:53.960 --> 44:56.960]  Ever since they introduced the one with the A4.
[44:56.960 --> 44:57.960]  Okay.
[44:57.960 --> 45:00.960]  Well, I'd say, you know, 99.99 that there's going to be a new iPhone.
[45:00.960 --> 45:03.960]  And then maybe just slightly less that it's going to have a new chip.
[45:03.960 --> 45:04.960]  Right.
[45:04.960 --> 45:05.960]  Anyway, it doesn't matter.
[45:05.960 --> 45:08.960]  But yeah, as you're saying, patterns that they've followed for years at this point.
[45:08.960 --> 45:09.960]  Right.
[45:09.960 --> 45:19.960]  And so to me, the thing that's most interesting about the iPad mini is the first one that was introduced in 2012 was like a year behind the big iPad.
[45:19.960 --> 45:25.960]  It was a year behind. It was still on the A5 when the big iPad had gone to the A6.
[45:25.960 --> 45:26.960]  It was not a year.
[45:26.960 --> 45:27.960]  Right.
[45:27.960 --> 45:28.960]  It didn't have the retina display.
[45:28.960 --> 45:29.960]  Right.
[45:29.960 --> 45:35.960]  And so I expected that in 2013 that it would still be one year behind.
[45:35.960 --> 45:40.960]  And it might go retina because the iPad had gone retina the year before, but that it would have the A6.
[45:40.960 --> 45:42.960]  The A6, where it, right.
[45:42.960 --> 45:48.960]  Which is how they, you know, how they, in other ways, you know, how they kept the prices so much lower than the full size.
[45:48.960 --> 45:50.960]  But it, like, skipped a year.
[45:50.960 --> 45:51.960]  It, to me, engineering lies.
[45:51.960 --> 46:02.960]  And went all the way from an A5 non retina device to top of the line A7 retina and not thicker like the original retina iPads were.
[46:02.960 --> 46:03.960]  Right.
[46:03.960 --> 46:10.960]  Kept the, this felt thinness, the long battery life and retina and went to the A7.
[46:10.960 --> 46:17.960]  I mean, it's like, there's like a tiny little asterisk you have to insert there because it's like the clock speed is like 5% slower than the iPad.
[46:17.960 --> 46:18.960]  Oh, is it?
[46:18.960 --> 46:20.960]  I don't even think I was aware of that.
[46:20.960 --> 46:24.960]  Yeah, but it's, it's really, really like, it's not even just an asterisk.
[46:24.960 --> 46:25.960]  It's like a tiny.
[46:25.960 --> 46:30.960]  It's effectively, they effectively brought it up to the same level as the, as the full size iPad instead of keeping.
[46:30.960 --> 46:31.960]  Right.
[46:31.960 --> 46:39.960]  In a year when the full size iPad had a tremendous, your big jump in terms of the thickness and the width and, you know, battery life and stuff like that.
[46:39.960 --> 46:40.960]  Right.
[46:40.960 --> 46:41.960]  Which is amazing.
[46:41.960 --> 46:43.960]  And to me, that's just all Tim Cook.
[46:43.960 --> 46:49.960]  And then to hear that this, you know, that he, you know, he'd been a proponent of the mini size all along.
[46:49.960 --> 46:57.960]  I mean, you know, it seems like the guy gets credit both of the operations and for the, for actually anticipating the market demand.
[46:57.960 --> 46:58.960]  Right.
[46:58.960 --> 47:03.960]  Well, the thing that I think before I say this, I need to stipulate that I do own some Apple stock.
[47:03.960 --> 47:10.960]  But the thing that I can't ever really get behind in these articles is talking about growth.
[47:10.960 --> 47:13.960]  And I'm not like, I'm not some sage investor.
[47:13.960 --> 47:15.960]  I don't really know what I'm doing.
[47:15.960 --> 47:20.960]  But everything talks about how Apple's growth has slowed.
[47:20.960 --> 47:22.960]  And that's percentage growth.
[47:22.960 --> 47:23.960]  Right.
[47:23.960 --> 47:24.960]  Right.
[47:24.960 --> 47:26.960]  But why is that the metric?
[47:26.960 --> 47:34.960]  Can someone explain to me why, you know, if you go from being, I don't know how big they were 10 years ago, but they weren't that big.
[47:34.960 --> 47:41.960]  To either the biggest or second biggest or, you know, top five biggest companies in the world.
[47:41.960 --> 47:43.960]  Why is that not enough?
[47:43.960 --> 47:49.960]  And why do you need to continue growing beyond that point?
[47:49.960 --> 47:59.960]  Well, and I would even say the flip side that where they did have in the crazy go-go early years 2008, 2009, 2010 of the iPhone,
[47:59.960 --> 48:04.960]  where they did have crazy like 40% 30% year over year growth.
[48:04.960 --> 48:11.960]  Who thinks though that once you are the biggest company in the world that 30% growth is feasible?
[48:11.960 --> 48:12.960]  Right.
[48:12.960 --> 48:14.960]  It's, it's, it's, it almost is impossible.
[48:14.960 --> 48:17.960]  And I know this is not really the law of big numbers.
[48:17.960 --> 48:26.960]  But it's what some people use that phrase, which it simply means once you're that big, you can't grow at 30 or 40%.
[48:26.960 --> 48:33.960]  That's the thing is that if you go from one billion in sales to two billion, it's 100% growth.
[48:33.960 --> 48:38.960]  But to do two to four billion is obviously not as easy as one to two.
[48:38.960 --> 48:41.960]  And as the numbers get bigger and bigger, that becomes more difficult.
[48:41.960 --> 48:42.960]  Right.
[48:42.960 --> 48:47.960]  When you're literally the most profitable company in the world, not just profitable tech company, but most profitable company.
[48:47.960 --> 48:51.960]  Seven or eight percent growth year over year in profits is huge.
[48:51.960 --> 49:01.960]  And, and it's huge numbers of billions of dollars that everyone's, I shouldn't say everyone, but Wall Street or investors or, you know, whoever it is,
[49:01.960 --> 49:04.960]  seem so focused on the percentage growth.
[49:04.960 --> 49:10.960]  And I just look at these numbers and I think like, okay, they made, you know, $20 billion last quarter.
[49:10.960 --> 49:12.960]  That seems pretty good to me.
[49:12.960 --> 49:13.960]  Yeah.
[49:13.960 --> 49:24.960]  You know, and I phone in particular, which is the biggest and most profitable by revenue and profit line that Apple has, is in a fascinating market, which is phones.
[49:24.960 --> 49:34.960]  Because for the most part, there's an upper cap on how many phones are going to be in the world, which is one phone for every adult or even close to adult aged person.
[49:34.960 --> 49:37.960]  Well, I mean, unless you've got your day phone and your night phone.
[49:37.960 --> 49:44.960]  Right. Which is an exception. And, you know, there's obviously a lot of very elderly people who are not going to buy.
[49:44.960 --> 49:45.960]  No, I'm just kidding.
[49:45.960 --> 49:52.960]  And they're dying off. And there's, you know, children, I guess, you know, really young children are typically not going to get an iPhone.
[49:52.960 --> 50:02.960]  Right. Well, and it's not a, it's not a good that people trade them in or upgrade, but it's not a good that expires in any way, at least not in terms of months.
[50:02.960 --> 50:11.960]  It's, you know, what's the world population seven billion people? So let's say there's truly a hard cap at around three billion phones in the world.
[50:11.960 --> 50:12.960]  Let's say three or four.
[50:12.960 --> 50:13.960]  Sure. Why not?
[50:13.960 --> 50:23.960]  You know, and, you know, you could cut off large swaths of those people for, for not having the financial, they don't have enough money to buy an iPhone.
[50:23.960 --> 50:23.960]  Right.
[50:23.960 --> 50:28.960]  Right. It's just not going to happen. Or they live in a place where there still isn't cell service. Right. Right.
[50:28.960 --> 50:41.960]  You know, not that the iPhone has already peaked in a can't sell more, but it's, it's actually if you look at the numbers that have actually sold, it's remarkably close to, they've sold about as many as they could have hoped to at this point.
[50:41.960 --> 50:51.960]  And they've got to expand and interesting in new ways and wait for the world to catch up. You know, it's, it's truly, they've done almost as well with the iPhone as they possibly could.
[50:51.960 --> 50:52.960]  Right.
[50:52.960 --> 51:00.960]  Right. Like if you said in 2007 when they came out with it, what's the best case scenario for the next seven years? Right.
[51:00.960 --> 51:10.960]  It almost, it's almost as though that they've, they've, they've, they've, you know, they've done as well with it as they possibly could have expected to do.
[51:10.960 --> 51:25.960]  And that years where they were having 30 or 40% growth, that was those were the years where they were expanding to new carriers around the world. I mean, it's, this is a thing that debuted on one carrier in one country in 2007.
[51:25.960 --> 51:34.960]  And because of the nature of the way that they control the customer experience and that, you know, it's so different than than what the carriers expect or want.
[51:34.960 --> 51:47.960]  You know, it was a relatively slow rollout around the world. And that's what made the growth possible is that there are these countries where it hadn't been sold, except like on the gray market.
[51:47.960 --> 51:55.960]  And then they debut and they could, you know, it would allow for this tremendous growth. Whereas that type of growth, it's just not feasible to expect that.
[51:55.960 --> 51:56.960]  Right. Right.
[51:56.960 --> 52:11.960]  Well, and, and then in that same piece, there was a quote from I forget who it was. It doesn't really matter some either investor or some analyst. And I wrote this down because he said he thought Apple no longer had the juice to create the world beating product it needs.
[52:11.960 --> 52:22.960]  And so let's, let's, I can even, I can even say, you know, maybe he's right, maybe they cannot create another iPhone. Maybe there's no market that exists or maybe they don't have the ability to create a market.
[52:22.960 --> 52:34.960]  But the word needs in that sense is really what sort of sticks because this is, again, I don't know what it is right now today, but it's one of the biggest companies in the world, one of the most profitable companies in the world.
[52:34.960 --> 52:40.960]  And they've got how much money in the bank. What does needs mean in that sense?
[52:40.960 --> 52:46.960]  Right. It's not what Apple needs. It's what these investors who seek huge returns on his stock, right?
[52:46.960 --> 52:51.960]  Right. What they need to justify continuing to support Apple.
[52:51.960 --> 52:57.960]  Here's a quote that they have in this time story from, you know, this is the balance that was added to the story.
[52:57.960 --> 53:03.960]  This is from Lawrence I. Walter, chief market strategist at Oracle Investment Research.
[53:03.960 --> 53:09.960]  Well, the article, this is, this is the, the, the Times Arthur's words.
[53:09.960 --> 53:16.960]  Investors have clamored for Apple wizardry, a much anticipated I watch or ITV perhaps to these critics.
[53:16.960 --> 53:25.960]  Mr. Cook is on inspiring his social views window dressing when what they want is magic, which is a little tell, I'm more telling than they could think.
[53:25.960 --> 53:35.960]  I think because I think that saying that they want magic, like they're presenting these guys as reasonable critics, whereas I'd say using the word magic is a little bit.
[53:35.960 --> 53:39.960]  It's actually spot on like what they want is not possible. Not, right?
[53:39.960 --> 53:40.960]  Or yeah.
[53:40.960 --> 53:45.960]  Here's the quote from this guy, Walter, where is the grand design?
[53:45.960 --> 53:51.960]  All we hear from Cook is that there are some great products coming down the pike.
[53:51.960 --> 53:55.960]  Mr. Walter calls Apple a financial rock of Gibraltar.
[53:55.960 --> 54:03.960]  It is sitting on about 150 billion in cash, but he says he has serious questions about whether it continued to be a hyper growth company.
[54:03.960 --> 54:10.960]  Is it a stock for growth investors he asks or quote widows?
[54:10.960 --> 54:13.960]  Which, and now to me, it's actually a little insulting.
[54:13.960 --> 54:15.960]  Right.
[54:15.960 --> 54:21.960]  Like now it's like the alpha male investor on Wall Street.
[54:21.960 --> 54:26.960]  What exactly is wrong with widows?
[54:26.960 --> 54:27.960]  Right.
[54:27.960 --> 54:29.960]  And then with a blue chip stock.
[54:29.960 --> 54:30.960]  Right.
[54:30.960 --> 54:38.960]  Which turns out earnings every year and pays a dividend and is a viable thing to hold on to and earn you some money.
[54:38.960 --> 54:44.960]  Right. Women whose husbands have died are looking for stability, I guess.
[54:44.960 --> 54:46.960]  Yeah. I guess.
[54:46.960 --> 54:49.960]  And exactly. Like you said, what's what's wrong with that either?
[54:49.960 --> 54:51.960]  Well, I mean, and you're right.
[54:51.960 --> 54:55.960]  It presents it as a, you know, it should be this hyper growth stock.
[54:55.960 --> 54:56.960]  And instead it's this boring.
[54:56.960 --> 54:57.960]  Right.
[54:57.960 --> 55:00.960]  You'll just make a little bit of money off at every year's stock.
[55:00.960 --> 55:01.960]  Right.
[55:01.960 --> 55:02.960]  Yeah.
[55:02.960 --> 55:04.960]  Like I said, I can't.
[55:04.960 --> 55:11.960]  I can't read too much of the stock analysis of Apple just because it's just so insane.
[55:11.960 --> 55:12.960]  Right.
[55:12.960 --> 55:22.960]  And it's never been a fair way to necessarily measure the CEO because the stock is into some ways outside the CEO.
[55:22.960 --> 55:26.960]  Well, in large ways, outside the CEO's control.
[55:26.960 --> 55:30.960]  You know, judge them by their revenue and their profit and their product lines.
[55:30.960 --> 55:36.960]  But what, what happens to the stock prices often irrational in an Apple's case, usually irrational.
[55:36.960 --> 55:42.960]  Even if you do think the CEO should be judged based on the stock, if you look at the numbers, it's way up since he took over.
[55:42.960 --> 55:43.960]  Right.
[55:43.960 --> 55:44.960]  Way up.
[55:44.960 --> 55:53.960]  And in fact, it's, that's the point I'm getting at is that this, it's, it's actually getting to me this times article if you really read between the lines and look at it.
[55:53.960 --> 56:01.960]  Um, the stuff in Tim Cook's favor is a lot of it is concrete, things like the iPad mini being in.
[56:01.960 --> 56:12.960]  Um, largely brushed over in this article, but, but the stuff at WWDC, where you see Apple is an organization really working to pulling together in a cohesive way.
[56:12.960 --> 56:15.960]  Between normal company, right.
[56:15.960 --> 56:16.960]  Right.
[56:16.960 --> 56:28.960]  And in a way that shows that these products they've already got, the iPhone and the iPad and even the Mac, which is, you know, the longest standing, still have deep areas to be improved.
[56:28.960 --> 56:31.960]  That they're nowhere close to being finished.
[56:31.960 --> 56:38.960]  You know, and that it's a shallowness to say, give me something new, give me a watch or a TV that the iPhone and iPad are old news.
[56:38.960 --> 56:49.960]  Whereas there's still so, so much to do to improve those products, even in the short term, even just this year and next year, let alone for the next decade.
[56:49.960 --> 56:50.960]  Right.
[56:50.960 --> 57:05.960]  And it's such a shallow way to look at them as to say that, that they need, you know, like use emphasize the word need, that they need something new when there's so much work that can be done and improvements that can be made to these existing products.
[57:05.960 --> 57:15.960]  But then conversely, the negative stuff, the balance, you know, well, I don't know, maybe the guy is an empty shirt is getting so much, the sauce is so much weaker.
[57:15.960 --> 57:16.960]  Right.
[57:16.960 --> 57:27.960]  They're still in this article using the stock dive in 2013, right, against cook that investors doubted the guy and the stock went from.
[57:27.960 --> 57:41.960]  60 over 700 down under 500. And this is the old pre split numbers, but it's, they're still using that like, hey, there's proof that the guy, you know, is maybe on shaky ground.
[57:41.960 --> 57:50.960]  Whereas really what that stock dip proved was that a lot of investors believed not that Tim Cook was an empty shirt, but that a lot of investors thought he was an empty shirt.
[57:50.960 --> 57:54.960]  Right. It's not proof that he was. It's proof that somebody believed he was. Right.
[57:54.960 --> 58:06.960]  Right. But the article came out in June of 2014 when the stock goes back up at near historic peaks and way higher. I mean, I might even be.
[58:06.960 --> 58:11.960]  I think it was around 350 when he took over. Right. I'm writing that number out of the year, but I'm pretty sure that's right.
[58:11.960 --> 58:20.960]  If it's not double, it is very close to double the peak of where it was when when Steve Jobs, you know, is right.
[58:20.960 --> 58:33.960]  So yeah, it went up and then it went down a little bit from there, but was still way over where it had been and now it's back up. Right. So that the only way you can use it as a cudgel against him is to ignore what's happened after.
[58:33.960 --> 58:47.960]  You know, you've got to still be stuck at like late 2013 when it was depressed. It's actually the stock now is it's not a good example of problems with Tim Cook.
[58:47.960 --> 58:53.960]  And then the last, well, there's two things I wanted to talk about in the article, but.
[58:53.960 --> 58:59.960]  The last thing in the article, I thought was weird too. Is there a Beatles comparison?
[58:59.960 --> 59:07.960]  Oh, yeah, maybe. Yeah. Was it? Was that who gave it? It's like they found some guys at WWDC who claimed to be, you know, I found him.
[59:07.960 --> 59:15.960]  Right. And yeah, and one of them. The quote that I have is that I wrote this down too is that jobs is to John Lennon.
[59:15.960 --> 59:34.960]  But Tim Cook is to Ringo. Yeah. I mean, nothing against Ringo, but I mean, that's I don't know. I couldn't I couldn't caught onto the idea that that jobs is Lennon and Tim Cook is not Paul McCartney. He's freaking Ringo.
[59:34.960 --> 59:36.960]  Right.
[59:36.960 --> 59:49.960]  I think it's I think comparisons to the Beatles in this case are pretty it doesn't work. It doesn't work. But it's yeah, they let that you know, but they found somebody obviously doesn't think much of Tim Cook and then at the very end of the article.
[59:49.960 --> 1:00:03.960]  They found one thing particularly jarring in the keynote Apple did not hue to its tradition of pairing hardware and software specifically Apple introduced a program called Health which helps consumers and doctors monitor health status like heart rate or glucose levels.
[1:00:03.960 --> 1:00:13.960]  But did not also introduce a piece of hardware to measure those results. That is something the new smart smartwatch is rumored to do quote from this guy, Mr. Ziliff.
[1:00:13.960 --> 1:00:20.960]  They just released software said Mr. Ziliff sounding surprised. It's something Steve wouldn't have done.
[1:00:20.960 --> 1:00:27.960]  It's an impossible comparison, but it's one that Mr. Cook is being held to at least until he makes enough magic of his own and then the article ends.
[1:00:27.960 --> 1:00:36.960]  So they just let this guy say this. They quote this guy who was at WDDC saying in the last paragraph, it's something Steve wouldn't have done.
[1:00:36.960 --> 1:00:42.960]  Whereas you can list you probably run out of fingers listing WWDCs where they didn't introduce new heart rate.
[1:00:42.960 --> 1:00:56.960]  Right. Right. Well, and recently it's all been new iOS stuff that then in the fall you realize, oh right, the phone does have, you know, two cameras or a GPS or I'm trying to think of a more recent example.
[1:00:56.960 --> 1:01:00.960]  You know, the phone does have things that go with this software.
[1:01:00.960 --> 1:01:06.960]  Right, including 2011 Steve Jobs last WWDC was no hardware. Right.
[1:01:06.960 --> 1:01:15.960]  It was actually the WWDC where they moved the iPhones from right to the fall and there was no hardware.
[1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:20.960]  It was the eye, you know, it was like the introduction of iCloud as a strategy, which was software.
[1:01:20.960 --> 1:01:26.960]  And so they don't, they just let the quote stand like that to me and that's how the article ends. They say that something Steve wouldn't have done.
[1:01:26.960 --> 1:01:36.960]  Whereas the times could have easily fact checked. Right and said actually it is something that not only would he have done, he did do and that to me is maddening.
[1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:41.960]  And to me is the sort of thing you would think you would expect better from the New York Times.
[1:01:41.960 --> 1:01:49.960]  But it's because I feel like it didn't even occur to them because their perspective is they want this false balance.
[1:01:49.960 --> 1:01:50.960]  Right.
[1:01:50.960 --> 1:01:55.960]  Where you've got, you know, where you've got to have somebody saying that something like this.
[1:01:55.960 --> 1:02:01.960]  Otherwise it seems like Tim Cook is, it's too balanced and too, too skewed in favor.
[1:02:01.960 --> 1:02:05.960]  It's actually doing a good job. Right. Whereas that's what the actual facts say.
[1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:12.960]  And it's just maddening to me that that's who they speak to from WWDC. Whereas I thought it was, I know you missed it this year.
[1:02:12.960 --> 1:02:18.960]  You weren't out there, but it was a crazily popular WWDC from developers perspective.
[1:02:18.960 --> 1:02:22.960]  Right. Right. Yeah. I mean, and you could see that after the fact in terms of developer resistance.
[1:02:22.960 --> 1:02:28.960]  And you didn't even have to be there for that. You know the announcements, you know that it's a lot of stuff that developers have been asking for.
[1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:36.960]  Right. It's really crazy. Let me take a second break here and thank our next sponsor and we'll keep going.
[1:02:36.960 --> 1:02:42.960]  It's our good friends at igloo. igloo is the internet you'll actually like.
[1:02:42.960 --> 1:02:49.960]  It's built with easy to use integrated apps like shared calendars, Twitter like micro blogs, file sharing and more. Right.
[1:02:49.960 --> 1:02:54.960]  So think about having a little Twitter for your team or your company where it's private.
[1:02:54.960 --> 1:03:01.960]  It's on your own hosted site separate from real Twitter, but you can post Twitter like things just amongst yourselves.
[1:03:01.960 --> 1:03:09.960]  Great idea. Everything you need is built in. Everything is social. So if you upload a file or you write a post on the internal blog.
[1:03:09.960 --> 1:03:15.960]  Your team can share it, comment it, rate it, like it, even manage versions of that document all within the igloo system.
[1:03:15.960 --> 1:03:20.960]  The idea is you get your whole company or your team within the company communicating better.
[1:03:20.960 --> 1:03:33.960]  It gives your team or your company depending on your size a place to work and collaborate and they put control over the content and page layout into the hands of users without compromising the needs of your IT team.
[1:03:33.960 --> 1:03:42.960]  It's very secure. You can still manage permissions and you have centrally centralized authentication with open standards like LDAP.
[1:03:42.960 --> 1:03:49.960]  So give it a try. It's free to use. Free with up to 10 people. Enough to get your whole team on board. See what it's like.
[1:03:49.960 --> 1:03:54.960]  And very, very affordable once you go over 10 people.
[1:03:54.960 --> 1:03:59.960]  Learn more. Watch their videos. They've got great videos that explain the whole thing.
[1:03:59.960 --> 1:04:06.960]  How the whole thing works. Way better than I can here. Go to igloosoftware.com slash the talk show.
[1:04:06.960 --> 1:04:11.960]  igloosoftware.com slash the talk show and find out more.
[1:04:11.960 --> 1:04:17.960]  Great service. I've heard from so many people who listen to the show who signed up and are super, super happy with it. So check them out.
[1:04:17.960 --> 1:04:22.960]  I was not able to negotiate. You guys a better discount with my name on that one.
[1:04:22.960 --> 1:04:35.960]  I thought there was one more thing in this time story that got under my skin, which was when they were talking about Tim Cook and Apple's charitable giving.
[1:04:35.960 --> 1:04:43.960]  And the whole thing with the telling the investors at the annual meeting that if they won't, you know, with regard to their environmental stance.
[1:04:43.960 --> 1:05:01.960]  They care about as the return on investment and get out of the stock, right? Right. And that they're going to do the right thing. And this was from some investors with admittedly right wing views on climate change and and similar.
[1:05:01.960 --> 1:05:07.960]  You know, that sort of environmental type things.
[1:05:07.960 --> 1:05:15.960]  And I thought that the article sort of painted Tim Cook tried to paint him a little bit as sort of a wasse.
[1:05:15.960 --> 1:05:35.960]  You know, like he's sort of a namsie pamsie wasting money on things that a CEO's I thought that they presented that side of the argument a lot more than then the flip side that they didn't really seem to have any quotes from anybody who who backs his leadership on on those concerns.
[1:05:35.960 --> 1:05:41.960]  Right. They had quotes from the people who were against it and nothing from the people for it. And I thought that was a little.
[1:05:41.960 --> 1:05:45.960]  Well, I mean Tim Cook to Tim Cook declined to be interviewed. So that's.
[1:05:45.960 --> 1:05:52.960]  Yeah, I guess. But I thought that was a little weird. And then it was a weird thing where they were comparing Apple's charitable giving to Microsoft.
[1:05:52.960 --> 1:06:02.960]  Yeah, did you work out the math on that? Because well, I'd leave that to you. You're you're well, I just I you know, I did a mental calculation on it.
[1:06:02.960 --> 1:06:09.960]  And it was something like, you know, under cook Apple has increased their charitable giving and their matching of employees charitable giving.
[1:06:09.960 --> 1:06:18.960]  And I don't remember the numbers. It doesn't really matter. You can look it up in the article. But basically it said something like in the past two years, 50 million has been donated.
[1:06:18.960 --> 1:06:23.960]  But in the past two decades, Microsoft has donated like over a billion.
[1:06:23.960 --> 1:06:36.960]  Yeah, that's exactly that it's over two decades. Microsoft is employees donations inclusive of the corporate match have donated a billion dollars since 1983. So two decades.
[1:06:36.960 --> 1:06:41.960]  Right. And so if you if you do the or three decades, right, 93, yeah, that's three decades.
[1:06:41.960 --> 1:06:51.960]  If you do the math like it worked out that yeah, Apple might not have, you know, might not be doing quite as much on average as Microsoft did over 20 years.
[1:06:51.960 --> 1:06:54.960]  But in the past two years, the numbers are way up.
[1:06:54.960 --> 1:07:01.960]  And it doesn't really make sense to compare 20 years worth of donations to two years.
[1:07:01.960 --> 1:07:05.960]  When they've just started this program out.
[1:07:05.960 --> 1:07:13.960]  So the whole thing, the math on it seemed it was just it was it was an apple in order to comparison to use a phrase that doesn't work that well for Apple.
[1:07:13.960 --> 1:07:16.960]  But it didn't really make sense to me as I was reading it.
[1:07:16.960 --> 1:07:24.960]  Well, if you divide a billion over 30 years from Microsoft is 33 billion or a million a year.
[1:07:24.960 --> 1:07:31.960]  Or 33 million a year. And that are saying Apple has donated 50, 50 years and two years.
[1:07:31.960 --> 1:07:36.960]  Well, so it's in the ballpark. Now there's inflation adjustment, et cetera, where 1983 dollars are worthless.
[1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:41.960]  So maybe Microsoft has been giving, you know, more, but still they're in the ballpark when you look at it that way.
[1:07:41.960 --> 1:07:49.960]  And it's new is it's they've recently gotten into the ballpark. So it doesn't seem to make sense to me to compare it over the past 20 or 30 years.
[1:07:49.960 --> 1:07:58.960]  Right. And the other thing too that they just toss out there as though it's equivalent is that Microsoft says that on average it donates $2 million a day.
[1:07:58.960 --> 1:08:06.960]  The software in software to nonprofits, which is great. It's better than not doing it, but let's face it.
[1:08:06.960 --> 1:08:12.960]  You know, that's that's a valuing office at like $900 or something, which nobody writes.
[1:08:12.960 --> 1:08:23.960]  Right. Right. It would be great if rogue amoeba donated software to nonprofits, but it's not the same thing as rogue amoeba donating money to nonprofits, you know.
[1:08:23.960 --> 1:08:32.960]  And two million sounds like a lot. Like it would be a lot for rogue amoeba or Q brands to donate $2 million a day in software.
[1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:38.960]  Right. Yeah, two million a day. It would be a lot of copies of Vesper.
[1:08:38.960 --> 1:08:45.960]  But from Microsoft it's not, especially given the fact that they can, you know, that the prices they charge for their software are just arbitrary.
[1:08:45.960 --> 1:08:53.960]  It's not real good. It's not the same thing as for example donating $2 million a day in hardware to nonprofits, which has a fixed cost.
[1:08:53.960 --> 1:08:57.960]  So it's a weird I thought it was a weird and slanted comparison.
[1:08:57.960 --> 1:09:00.960]  Yeah. All right. What else you got?
[1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:06.960]  Well, we were we were talking growth. I think you wanted to touch on the physical growth of the iPhone.
[1:09:06.960 --> 1:09:10.960]  Oh, there you go. Miss egg right. That's why. Yeah.
[1:09:10.960 --> 1:09:14.960]  So we've got that's the other big story that came out this week and this is nothing new.
[1:09:14.960 --> 1:09:21.960]  This is, you know, it's just verifying months long rumors, but that Bloomberg yesterday this is Peter Burrows.
[1:09:21.960 --> 1:09:24.960]  Well, hold on. Don't use the word verifying because.
[1:09:24.960 --> 1:09:26.960]  Oh, not verify. That's a wrong.
[1:09:26.960 --> 1:09:31.960]  I don't know. I don't mean to criticize you. I'm talking more about all the sites that publish this stuff all the time.
[1:09:31.960 --> 1:09:35.960]  Now we've got a slightly more reputable site with maybe better sourcing, right?
[1:09:35.960 --> 1:09:37.960]  All right. Echo. There you go.
[1:09:37.960 --> 1:09:43.960]  The rumors. There's Tim Culpin and Peter Burrows reporting for Bloomberg.
[1:09:43.960 --> 1:09:48.960]  Apple's big iPhones plural said to start production next month.
[1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:55.960]  Apple suppliers in China will begin mass production of its largest iPhones ever next month according to people familiar with the plans.
[1:09:55.960 --> 1:10:00.960]  As the smartphone maker faces increased competition.
[1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:04.960]  Bubble blog asked not to be identified because the plans are private.
[1:10:04.960 --> 1:10:10.960]  One model will have a 4.7 inch display compared to the four inch screen of the current five S.
[1:10:10.960 --> 1:10:15.960]  That may be available to ship to retailers around September said two of the people.
[1:10:15.960 --> 1:10:22.960]  A 5.5 inch version is also being prepared for manufacturing and may be available at the same time that people said.
[1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:35.960]  So they're saying, and this has been rumored by various people for a while, that there's two new bigger iPhones this year, a 4.7 inch diagonal display and a 5.5 inch.
[1:10:35.960 --> 1:10:42.960]  This is a lot of, I feel like we could easily fill the rest of the show just talking about this.
[1:10:42.960 --> 1:10:49.960]  I don't even understand. I don't even understand the aspect that this 5.5 inch version may be available at the same time.
[1:10:49.960 --> 1:10:53.960]  As if they might release this in like January or something.
[1:10:53.960 --> 1:10:57.960]  Even as we just talked about, you know, 10 minutes ago about the patterns that Apple follows,
[1:10:57.960 --> 1:11:02.960]  they don't release a new iPhone in the middle of the year with a different size.
[1:11:02.960 --> 1:11:08.960]  Right. I don't get it. I've never been less excited.
[1:11:08.960 --> 1:11:16.960]  Not excited. Well, I'm not exactly because I'm personally a little, yeah.
[1:11:16.960 --> 1:11:21.960]  I don't want to be like, I mean, I'll just put that right out there. I'm holding my iPhone right now.
[1:11:21.960 --> 1:11:26.960]  It's a 4 inch screen and it's almost too big to me.
[1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:32.960]  I could see how maybe I could get used to a 4.7.
[1:11:32.960 --> 1:11:36.960]  I've seen 4.7 devices, but that to me seems, just the width seems to me annoying.
[1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:41.960]  5.5, I've seen those phones. I know that I don't want one. I know that I don't.
[1:11:41.960 --> 1:11:46.960]  It just seems weird to me. No, I've never, even my personal tastes aside.
[1:11:46.960 --> 1:11:50.960]  Even let's say I really want, even if I wanted a huge iPhone.
[1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:58.960]  I just don't understand how Apple's going to present it in a keynote where they say,
[1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:01.960]  you know, I could see how they would say, look, everybody wants a big phone.
[1:12:01.960 --> 1:12:07.960]  Here's a bigger iPhone. I don't understand how they say, here's two bigger iPhone.
[1:12:07.960 --> 1:12:14.960]  Bigger and even more humongous. And the size that you've grown used to over the last seven years.
[1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:21.960]  And that is made the iPhone that by far, you know, 70% of all the profits in the entire handset industry is now.
[1:12:21.960 --> 1:12:25.960]  Right. That was, yeah, that was your big thing is that you're reading this as them saying,
[1:12:25.960 --> 1:12:29.960]  there will be a 4.7 and a 5.5 and that's it.
[1:12:29.960 --> 1:12:31.960]  And that's all I've ever seen rumored.
[1:12:31.960 --> 1:12:38.960]  I've never seen from any of these other rumors, rumors of a new four-inch, big current size iPhone.
[1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:46.960]  Right. Well, but I guess the question is, how would that, how would that leak versus if the size changes,
[1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:49.960]  it's much more obvious, right?
[1:12:49.960 --> 1:12:58.960]  Well, part of it too. And over the last few years, the track record's been pretty good on the component leaks out of Asia.
[1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:06.960]  And what they're showing this year is something that's more along the lines of the iPads with rounded sides.
[1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:07.960]  Okay. Have you seen any of this?
[1:13:07.960 --> 1:13:11.960]  I haven't. I really don't look at this stuff just because I wait till it comes out.
[1:13:11.960 --> 1:13:12.960]  But I understand what you're saying.
[1:13:12.960 --> 1:13:17.960]  A lot of what's come out and from sources that have been pretty accurate in years past, you know,
[1:13:17.960 --> 1:13:27.960]  and that got the new iPhone 5 shape and same type of people who had like leaks of the gold iPhone last year.
[1:13:27.960 --> 1:13:28.960]  Okay.
[1:13:28.960 --> 1:13:41.960]  Are showing I have 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch phones with more or less just think of a smaller iPad or iPad mini with the rounder sides and those style brands.
[1:13:41.960 --> 1:13:45.960]  And nothing like that has leaked with a four-inch.
[1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:52.960]  So let's, if you presume now, obviously this is an enormous if this is the biggest if I could make on the show.
[1:13:52.960 --> 1:14:02.960]  If we take it for granted that all new iPhone hardware will inevitably leak from the Asian supply chain.
[1:14:02.960 --> 1:14:03.960]  Okay.
[1:14:03.960 --> 1:14:05.960]  Again, that is an enormous if.
[1:14:05.960 --> 1:14:18.960]  But if we take that as an assumption, then the only way that the four-inch screen stays at the top of the, you know, gets the A8 and new camera and, you know, stays at the top of the heap technology-wise.
[1:14:18.960 --> 1:14:22.960]  Spec-wise, is if it's going to still be in the.
[1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:22.960]  Correct.
[1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:24.960]  Five S four and a half.
[1:14:24.960 --> 1:14:30.960]  Which seems different if there's two new models that have a new iPad style look.
[1:14:30.960 --> 1:14:31.960]  Yeah.
[1:14:31.960 --> 1:14:33.960]  Like it's possible, I guess.
[1:14:33.960 --> 1:14:34.960]  But it just seems weird.
[1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:47.960]  Like to me, for example, the way that I just mentioned before that in 2013 last fall Apple introduced two new iPads, the new mini with retina and the new iPad air.
[1:14:47.960 --> 1:14:52.960]  And they had the same spec, same camera, same A7 system on a chip.
[1:14:52.960 --> 1:14:55.960]  You know, roughly it's just, hey, which size do you want?
[1:14:55.960 --> 1:14:56.960]  Right.
[1:14:56.960 --> 1:14:58.960]  And they also looked like siblings.
[1:14:58.960 --> 1:14:59.960]  Right.
[1:14:59.960 --> 1:15:02.960]  They looked like the same device trunk up and down.
[1:15:02.960 --> 1:15:04.960]  Well, but if you even.
[1:15:04.960 --> 1:15:05.960]  Right.
[1:15:05.960 --> 1:15:14.960]  So I mean, the question is, are they going to keep a four-inch screen as a sibling, a brother to the exist or the new sizes.
[1:15:14.960 --> 1:15:22.960]  But if you're going to do that, if you're going to change the case, that's going to present all sorts of manufacturing challenges, right?
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:23.960]  I would guess.
[1:15:23.960 --> 1:15:27.960]  So I mean, it might make sense to put the new hardware in there.
[1:15:27.960 --> 1:15:30.960]  You know, whatever the new chip is, new camera, whatever.
[1:15:30.960 --> 1:15:37.960]  But keep the current case because you've already tooled up all your factories for that current four-inch sized case.
[1:15:37.960 --> 1:15:41.960]  Yeah, but they've never kept the same four factor form factor for more than two years.
[1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:45.960]  The 3G 3GS was two years. The four 4s was two years.
[1:15:45.960 --> 1:15:46.960]  And that's true.
[1:15:46.960 --> 1:15:47.960]  The five 5s.
[1:15:47.960 --> 1:16:00.960]  Now, there's, you know, again, the fact that that's the pattern that they've had ever since the, you know, the 3G, you know, in the original 2007 iPhone was the only one that only lasted a year.
[1:16:00.960 --> 1:16:02.960]  Does that mean that it will always be so?
[1:16:02.960 --> 1:16:03.960]  Maybe not.
[1:16:03.960 --> 1:16:12.960]  You know, maybe this form factor, the five 5s form factor is like their Porsche 911, you know, we don't need to change it.
[1:16:12.960 --> 1:16:16.960]  You know, this is, this is the way the four-inch iPhone looks all the time.
[1:16:16.960 --> 1:16:18.960]  And there's, and it doesn't look dated.
[1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:20.960]  It looks still looks great.
[1:16:20.960 --> 1:16:24.960]  I mean, ultimately what we'll see in what three months?
[1:16:24.960 --> 1:16:30.960]  I would guess September because that's, it's been September for ever since they moved it to the phone, right?
[1:16:30.960 --> 1:16:36.960]  And then October is for iPads and perhaps the watch or whatever else they're going to do.
[1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:39.960]  But I would guess the phone gets its own event in September.
[1:16:39.960 --> 1:16:40.960]  Right.
[1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:48.960]  Well, I said to you, I said the interesting thing to me was not the physical size growing because I'm, as I said, I'm pretty happy with the current physical size.
[1:16:48.960 --> 1:16:54.960]  I'm interested to see a storage space increase in the device.
[1:16:54.960 --> 1:16:55.960]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:16:55.960 --> 1:16:57.960]  And nobody has any kind of rumors about that.
[1:16:57.960 --> 1:17:02.960]  Well, again, I guess, is that something that would even leak because, you know, they already make 128 gig iPad.
[1:17:02.960 --> 1:17:06.960]  So the, the storage already exists in that size.
[1:17:06.960 --> 1:17:13.960]  Uh, how different would the, with the physical, you know, the case wouldn't need to be any different just to put a little more storage space in there, probably.
[1:17:13.960 --> 1:17:14.960]  Yeah, I don't think so.
[1:17:14.960 --> 1:17:17.960]  I don't think the 128 gigabyte chips would be bigger.
[1:17:17.960 --> 1:17:24.960]  And, and along the same lines, I would really, really, I think it's almost overdue at this point, like to see more RAM.
[1:17:24.960 --> 1:17:29.960]  Okay. Because they've, they've been all it, the iPhone's been at one gigabyte of RAM.
[1:17:29.960 --> 1:17:30.960]  Since.
[1:17:30.960 --> 1:17:31.960]  For a while now.
[1:17:31.960 --> 1:17:33.960]  I forget which was in the first iPhone five.
[1:17:33.960 --> 1:17:34.960]  I think the five.
[1:17:34.960 --> 1:17:42.960]  Um, you know, and in that TikTok strategy of every two years, they, they take bigger leaps forward.
[1:17:42.960 --> 1:17:45.960]  Uh, I would really like to see him go to two gigabytes.
[1:17:45.960 --> 1:17:51.960]  Well, now, do you, do you think you notice a, a lack of RAM?
[1:17:51.960 --> 1:17:57.960]  Less so than used to, but I still get those, you know, it's, it's most noticeable in Safari.
[1:17:57.960 --> 1:18:20.960]  Okay.
[1:18:20.960 --> 1:18:21.960]  So, it's a storage space.
[1:18:21.960 --> 1:18:22.960]  It's very obvious.
[1:18:22.960 --> 1:18:24.960]  If I want to put all of my music on there, I can't do it.
[1:18:24.960 --> 1:18:26.960]  Whereas with RAM, it's more of a nebulous.
[1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:29.960]  You know, as you said, some days Safari tab needs to reload.
[1:18:29.960 --> 1:18:34.960]  And, uh, but the other, that is, that is, I guess, one of the, one of the obvious ways you can tell.
[1:18:34.960 --> 1:18:35.960]  Yeah.
[1:18:35.960 --> 1:18:40.960]  And, you know, I don't play ton of games on my phone, but, uh, I know a lot of people do.
[1:18:40.960 --> 1:18:41.960]  Jonas certainly does.
[1:18:41.960 --> 1:18:45.960]  And there, you know, games typically, you know, can use as much RAM as you can throw at him.
[1:18:45.960 --> 1:18:46.960]  Right.
[1:18:46.960 --> 1:18:47.960]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:18:47.960 --> 1:18:52.960]  You know, so it's not so much that I personally on a day-to-day basis really, really need more RAM in my,
[1:18:52.960 --> 1:18:53.960]  in the iPhone.
[1:18:53.960 --> 1:18:56.960]  But I think that the iPhone as a platform could use it more.
[1:18:56.960 --> 1:18:57.960]  Yeah.
[1:18:57.960 --> 1:18:58.960]  Right.
[1:18:58.960 --> 1:18:59.960]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:18:59.960 --> 1:19:07.960]  And the iPad too, especially if it's true that they're going to add some sort of multitasking type interface where you can run two apps at the same time.
[1:19:07.960 --> 1:19:08.960]  Right.
[1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:09.960]  Sure.
[1:19:09.960 --> 1:19:10.960]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[1:19:10.960 --> 1:19:16.960]  I just, I still, I just can't see how they would spin, uh, an introduction where they say we've added two new sizes above it.
[1:19:16.960 --> 1:19:20.960]  And, but yet the four-inch one looks exactly the same as it used to.
[1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:21.960]  Right.
[1:19:21.960 --> 1:19:32.960]  Well, I mean, honestly, if you look at where we're, especially you, I think, are very fixated on the devices and pay much more attention to them than most people.
[1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:42.960]  Uh, but I mean, if you look at a bunch of iPhones side by side, the user experience is not really very different between them.
[1:19:42.960 --> 1:19:46.960]  From a, you know, from a consumer standpoint, you know what I mean?
[1:19:46.960 --> 1:19:48.960]  In that there's always been a home button at the bottom.
[1:19:48.960 --> 1:19:50.960]  There's a power button at the top.
[1:19:50.960 --> 1:20:00.960]  Uh, I guess the headphone jack moved, but, uh, you know, would it really be that big a deal if the four-inch had one case and the four seven and five five if they exist had a different case?
[1:20:00.960 --> 1:20:03.960]  It's not, but it just seems weird.
[1:20:03.960 --> 1:20:08.960]  It just, it just feels a little off to me that if they were all going to be on the same level.
[1:20:08.960 --> 1:20:13.960]  The same level, spec-wise, it just would seem odd if one of them looked different than the apps.
[1:20:13.960 --> 1:20:14.960]  Yeah.
[1:20:14.960 --> 1:20:15.960]  It just seems a little off.
[1:20:15.960 --> 1:20:19.960]  And then that makes me think that if it's the case that they're going to.
[1:20:19.960 --> 1:20:22.960]  Your concern is that you're going to bail on the four-inch size, right?
[1:20:22.960 --> 1:20:23.960]  Exactly.
[1:20:23.960 --> 1:20:32.960]  That's my concern is that the new, you know, AA top of the tier, top tier iPhones are only going to be four seven and or five five.
[1:20:32.960 --> 1:20:36.960]  And that the four-inch size will no longer even be made with metal.
[1:20:36.960 --> 1:20:38.960]  I don't know what they're going to call it.
[1:20:38.960 --> 1:20:50.960]  The five CS, but that the, a phone with the five S specs will be in the plastic case that we saw last year at one at that $200 or $100 price level down.
[1:20:50.960 --> 1:20:55.960]  Well, selfishly, I hope that's not the case, but I don't have any insight as to whether or not that'll be the case.
[1:20:55.960 --> 1:21:05.960]  I mean, no, but nobody who's publishing these rumors does either, which makes me, it just convinces me that all of the leaks are from the supply chain and none of them are from
[1:21:05.960 --> 1:21:11.960]  Kubernetes, whereas there's only people who know nobody even says like what, you know, how they're going to price these things are.
[1:21:11.960 --> 1:21:16.960]  How much is the five point five inch going to be much more expensive, right?
[1:21:16.960 --> 1:21:18.960]  With the iPads, you pay for the bigger size.
[1:21:18.960 --> 1:21:21.960]  You pay for the size of the storage, right?
[1:21:21.960 --> 1:21:24.960]  Right. Does it make sense that you would, I just don't see how you do this.
[1:21:24.960 --> 1:21:33.960]  You know, maybe one of them is, you know, another possibility is that the four point seven inch is the
[1:21:33.960 --> 1:21:37.960]  the new flagship model, most expensive.
[1:21:37.960 --> 1:21:42.960]  And the five point five inch is the new five C lower price model.
[1:21:42.960 --> 1:21:47.960]  But then that seems weird to me that you that that's somebody.
[1:21:47.960 --> 1:21:55.960]  Let's say somebody who's older and has, you know, really wants the bigger phone because they really have trouble reading the smaller screen.
[1:21:55.960 --> 1:22:00.960]  They just want everything bigger because they want bigger text, which is a totally reasonable perfectly.
[1:22:00.960 --> 1:22:05.960]  Maybe the best example of why they should have multiple size iPhones available.
[1:22:05.960 --> 1:22:13.960]  But why would you be, why would you have to sacrifice on the specs to get the bigger screen because you really want the bigger screen?
[1:22:13.960 --> 1:22:15.960]  It doesn't make any sense to me.
[1:22:15.960 --> 1:22:23.960]  Like to me it makes the most sense to do it like the iPads and have same specs across the line and, you know, different price points.
[1:22:23.960 --> 1:22:27.960]  But I don't even know if the price differential, you know, on the iPads makes sense.
[1:22:27.960 --> 1:22:30.960]  Why is the iPad mini so much cheaper? I don't know.
[1:22:30.960 --> 1:22:31.960]  Right.
[1:22:31.960 --> 1:22:35.960]  I guess the screens are, I guess at a certain point you really just costs more to have a bigger screen.
[1:22:35.960 --> 1:22:37.960]  Yeah, screen and battery.
[1:22:37.960 --> 1:22:39.960]  Even if the pixels are the same.
[1:22:39.960 --> 1:22:40.960]  Right. Yeah.
[1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:43.960]  Because I mean, it needs a bigger screen physically and it needs a bigger battery physically.
[1:22:43.960 --> 1:22:46.960]  So, so what are you hoping for?
[1:22:46.960 --> 1:22:50.960]  I had Marco on talking about this. I've had you I'm so confused about this.
[1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:53.960]  I really don't see it where where this is how this is going to play.
[1:22:53.960 --> 1:22:59.960]  I mean, like I said, I try not to think about this until they've actually announced it and then I say, okay, that's the one I'm going to get.
[1:22:59.960 --> 1:23:02.960]  But like I said, I don't want a bigger phone.
[1:23:02.960 --> 1:23:05.960]  I certainly don't want a five and five point five inch phone.
[1:23:05.960 --> 1:23:09.960]  As you said, you've tried a phone like that. I've used a phone like that. It's way too big for my taste.
[1:23:09.960 --> 1:23:10.960]  It's really big.
[1:23:10.960 --> 1:23:12.960]  I can see why some people do.
[1:23:12.960 --> 1:23:14.960]  I can. I can totally see why Apple would make it.
[1:23:14.960 --> 1:23:16.960]  But I certainly don't. I don't think I want.
[1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:22.960]  And you don't want to be forced into getting it almost because you want the top of the line phone as far as specs.
[1:23:22.960 --> 1:23:24.960]  Exactly. Right.
[1:23:24.960 --> 1:23:26.960]  So yeah, I don't.
[1:23:26.960 --> 1:23:34.960]  I'm hopeful that a relatively reasonable size physical size phone will exist with the high level specs.
[1:23:34.960 --> 1:23:37.960]  But, you know, like I said, we'll see in place.
[1:23:37.960 --> 1:23:47.960]  The ace that the eight, which I mentioned a few times is maybe not even the best example of it because the the iPads have the A7 too this year.
[1:23:47.960 --> 1:23:55.960]  The two things that the iPhone 5S has that no other iOS device has is it has a better camera touch ID and has touch ID.
[1:23:55.960 --> 1:24:05.960]  And anything else they might introduce along those lines is going to be in the iPhone first because the iPhone has the market the profit margins to support the top of the line.
[1:24:05.960 --> 1:24:08.960]  The camera, you know, for me personally, the camera is the most important thing.
[1:24:08.960 --> 1:24:15.960]  I would probably buy whichever iPhone has the best camera even if it's the five point five inch.
[1:24:15.960 --> 1:24:19.960]  Well, if it was only the five point five inch man, that would I don't know what I would do.
[1:24:19.960 --> 1:24:21.960]  Because I mean, the camera has gotten pretty good.
[1:24:21.960 --> 1:24:23.960]  Like I went from the I forget.
[1:24:23.960 --> 1:24:26.960]  I went from like the iPhone one to the 3G or 3G S maybe.
[1:24:26.960 --> 1:24:28.960]  And the difference was enormous.
[1:24:28.960 --> 1:24:34.960]  But at this point, you can certainly see a difference, but it's pretty good already.
[1:24:34.960 --> 1:24:36.960]  You know what? You still see the difference indoors.
[1:24:36.960 --> 1:24:37.960]  Okay.
[1:24:37.960 --> 1:24:42.960]  Outdoors, I don't know that I can Pepsi challenge it, but indoors you can definitely still see the difference.
[1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:46.960]  Especially, you know, indoors in at night, you know, where low the low light situations.
[1:24:46.960 --> 1:24:47.960]  Right.
[1:24:47.960 --> 1:24:51.960]  You can definitely I think I could easily tell the difference, you know, five and a five.
[1:24:51.960 --> 1:24:53.960]  Well, but it's not even just telling the difference.
[1:24:53.960 --> 1:24:56.960]  It's is the is the lower one.
[1:24:56.960 --> 1:24:58.960]  Pretty good and pretty acceptable.
[1:24:58.960 --> 1:24:59.960]  Right.
[1:24:59.960 --> 1:25:07.960]  Well, and I still because I'm, you know, as I can to send my, you know, amateur camera enthusiast and, you know, I have cameras, you know,
[1:25:07.960 --> 1:25:12.960]  you know, real cameras that have fancy lenses and high ISO.
[1:25:12.960 --> 1:25:17.960]  So I know what it's like to have a camera that can do really well in low light.
[1:25:17.960 --> 1:25:22.960]  You know, and I just so I can see how much potential, you know, phone cameras still have to go in low light.
[1:25:22.960 --> 1:25:23.960]  To get to that point.
[1:25:23.960 --> 1:25:24.960]  Right.
[1:25:24.960 --> 1:25:31.960]  It would honestly it would break, it would truly break my heart if the 5.5 inch display is the only way to go top and run.
[1:25:31.960 --> 1:25:35.960]  I just can't see how they would make such an enormous leap.
[1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:39.960]  Because I'll tell you what, going from four inches to 5.5 inches, it's huge.
[1:25:39.960 --> 1:25:41.960]  It's just, it's just huge.
[1:25:41.960 --> 1:25:45.960]  It's, it sounds like you're just talking about an inch and a half, but it's not.
[1:25:45.960 --> 1:25:47.960]  It's just so much bigger device.
[1:25:47.960 --> 1:25:51.960]  I mean, it's, I think it's even bigger than like a field notes notebook.
[1:25:51.960 --> 1:25:53.960]  They're really, really big.
[1:25:53.960 --> 1:25:56.960]  And again, I can see why someone would want that.
[1:25:56.960 --> 1:26:03.960]  I totally understand the idea of, hey, I just, I want something right in the middle of a phone and a tablet because I'm going to use it all day long for these things.
[1:26:03.960 --> 1:26:05.960]  But that's not what I want.
[1:26:05.960 --> 1:26:06.960]  Right.
[1:26:06.960 --> 1:26:11.960]  I just want something that's as small as possible and not noticeable in my pocket until I want.
[1:26:11.960 --> 1:26:12.960]  Right.
[1:26:12.960 --> 1:26:13.960]  So I don't know.
[1:26:13.960 --> 1:26:15.960]  I really don't see how this is going to play out.
[1:26:15.960 --> 1:26:16.960]  Let me take a third break here.
[1:26:16.960 --> 1:26:17.960]  All right.
[1:26:17.960 --> 1:26:19.960]  Thank our final sponsor.
[1:26:19.960 --> 1:26:22.960]  And it's our great friends at Backblaze.
[1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:23.960]  You guys know Backblaze.
[1:26:23.960 --> 1:26:24.960]  They've been here before.
[1:26:24.960 --> 1:26:28.960]  Unlimited, unthrottle backup for your Mac.
[1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:31.960]  $5 a month for everything.
[1:26:31.960 --> 1:26:34.960]  Everything. You just pay $5 a month.
[1:26:34.960 --> 1:26:36.960]  You install their software.
[1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:37.960]  Yeah, it does.
[1:26:37.960 --> 1:26:41.960]  Take a long time for your initial upload if you have a lot of data.
[1:26:41.960 --> 1:26:42.960]  It's a good capital.
[1:26:42.960 --> 1:26:43.960]  It's a good capital.
[1:26:43.960 --> 1:26:44.960]  I like that.
[1:26:44.960 --> 1:26:45.960]  Yeah, it's true.
[1:26:45.960 --> 1:26:46.960]  There's no way around it.
[1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:48.960]  There's no way around it.
[1:26:48.960 --> 1:26:55.960]  If you've got, you know, a terabytes of data and, you know, there's just no way to get that up there instantly.
[1:26:55.960 --> 1:26:56.960]  But it does work.
[1:26:56.960 --> 1:26:57.960]  I have a lot of data.
[1:26:57.960 --> 1:27:00.960]  When I first signed up, it took a couple days, maybe even took a week from my initial upload.
[1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:03.960]  After that, everything's incremental, and it just works.
[1:27:03.960 --> 1:27:08.960]  They have over 100 petabytes of total data backed up.
[1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:11.960]  I don't even know how big a petabyte is, but it's in.
[1:27:11.960 --> 1:27:19.960]  Over 5 billion files have been restored by users of Backblaze.
[1:27:19.960 --> 1:27:21.960]  In other words, not that they've backed up 5 billion files.
[1:27:21.960 --> 1:27:23.960]  They've backed up way more than that.
[1:27:23.960 --> 1:27:29.960]  But 5 billion people who've needed to get their files restored from Backblaze have gotten them.
[1:27:29.960 --> 1:27:33.960]  They have an iOS app that lets you access and share any of your files.
[1:27:33.960 --> 1:27:36.960]  So if you're just on your iPhone, you need to get something from your Mac.
[1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:40.960]  You can just connect the Backblaze and get the version that was most recently backed up.
[1:27:40.960 --> 1:27:42.960]  You can restore one file.
[1:27:42.960 --> 1:27:45.960]  If you've just got one file, like, oh, man, what happened to that thing?
[1:27:45.960 --> 1:27:46.960]  I got it.
[1:27:46.960 --> 1:27:47.960]  You know, here it is.
[1:27:47.960 --> 1:27:48.960]  It's corrupted on my Mac.
[1:27:48.960 --> 1:27:49.960]  I'm going to get it from Backblaze.
[1:27:49.960 --> 1:27:50.960]  Go get it.
[1:27:50.960 --> 1:27:53.960]  Or all of your files, easily, with their web restore.
[1:27:53.960 --> 1:27:55.960]  It's founded by X Apple engineers.
[1:27:55.960 --> 1:27:59.960]  Backblaze runs natively on your Mac and on Mavericks.
[1:27:59.960 --> 1:28:02.960]  There's no add-ons, no gimmicks, no additional charges.
[1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:07.960]  If you're here $5 a month and think it's just too good to be true,
[1:28:07.960 --> 1:28:09.960]  it's really that's the deal.
[1:28:09.960 --> 1:28:10.960]  It's just fantastic.
[1:28:10.960 --> 1:28:12.960]  I've been telling you about it for months.
[1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:14.960]  I can't believe all of you haven't signed up yet,
[1:28:14.960 --> 1:28:17.960]  but they keep coming back because people keep signing up.
[1:28:17.960 --> 1:28:21.960]  And if you've been on the fence, I can't encourage you to do it strongly enough.
[1:28:21.960 --> 1:28:22.960]  It's great service.
[1:28:22.960 --> 1:28:26.960]  It just helps you sleep better at night knowing your stuff is everything on your Mac
[1:28:26.960 --> 1:28:28.960]  is backed up off-site out of your house.
[1:28:28.960 --> 1:28:30.960]  Where do you go to find out more?
[1:28:30.960 --> 1:28:36.960]  www.backblaze.com, slash daringfireball.
[1:28:36.960 --> 1:28:39.960]  Backblaze.com slash daringfireball.
[1:28:39.960 --> 1:28:41.960]  If you haven't signed up yet, you're not too yet.
[1:28:41.960 --> 1:28:43.960]  You're just crazy.
[1:28:43.960 --> 1:28:45.960]  So bigger storage, more RAM.
[1:28:45.960 --> 1:28:47.960]  I agree with you on that.
[1:28:47.960 --> 1:28:49.960]  I don't know if we conclude it on that,
[1:28:49.960 --> 1:28:51.960]  but I do think they should go more.
[1:28:51.960 --> 1:28:53.960]  And I think the way that people are shooting video,
[1:28:53.960 --> 1:28:55.960]  I think that it's essential.
[1:28:55.960 --> 1:28:59.960]  I know I've had family members come to me with iPhones that are filled up.
[1:28:59.960 --> 1:29:00.960]  Yeah.
[1:29:00.960 --> 1:29:04.960]  And it's because they shoot so many videos and photos.
[1:29:04.960 --> 1:29:06.960]  I mean, I don't know.
[1:29:06.960 --> 1:29:07.960]  I don't know.
[1:29:07.960 --> 1:29:10.960]  I think it's due.
[1:29:10.960 --> 1:29:12.960]  What else do we have on the agenda?
[1:29:12.960 --> 1:29:13.960]  What?
[1:29:13.960 --> 1:29:15.960]  So bigger iPhones.
[1:29:15.960 --> 1:29:17.960]  This is something I want to talk about last week when Guy was on.
[1:29:17.960 --> 1:29:18.960]  Just a small thing.
[1:29:18.960 --> 1:29:21.960]  I don't know if you saw it.
[1:29:21.960 --> 1:29:22.960]  Did you see the state of the union address?
[1:29:22.960 --> 1:29:23.960]  I haven't yet.
[1:29:23.960 --> 1:29:26.960]  As I said, I had to miss Dub Dub for a family matter.
[1:29:26.960 --> 1:29:28.960]  And so I haven't caught up on all the videos yet.
[1:29:28.960 --> 1:29:30.960]  So the state of the union is great.
[1:29:30.960 --> 1:29:33.960]  I recommend it for anybody who's only watched the keynote.
[1:29:33.960 --> 1:29:35.960]  And I know that there were a couple of weeks out from WDC.
[1:29:35.960 --> 1:29:38.960]  But if you want to watch one more, I recommend the platforms.
[1:29:38.960 --> 1:29:40.960]  It is always what, especially as a developer.
[1:29:40.960 --> 1:29:44.960]  But in general, there's often stuff in there that you didn't hear about in the keynote,
[1:29:44.960 --> 1:29:46.960]  but that could have been in the keynote.
[1:29:46.960 --> 1:29:49.960]  And if you're nerdy enough to, even if you're not a developer,
[1:29:49.960 --> 1:29:51.960]  but if you're nerdy enough to listen to this podcast,
[1:29:51.960 --> 1:29:54.960]  you're absolutely in the target audience for the state of the union.
[1:29:54.960 --> 1:29:56.960]  Because it's not super codey.
[1:29:56.960 --> 1:29:58.960]  It's not a lot of example code.
[1:29:58.960 --> 1:30:02.960]  It's at the level of the show, I think.
[1:30:02.960 --> 1:30:06.960]  But they give you details that they just cannot fit into the keynote
[1:30:06.960 --> 1:30:09.960]  or that they just don't want to put in the morning keynote.
[1:30:09.960 --> 1:30:11.960]  And the big one, it's such a towel.
[1:30:11.960 --> 1:30:12.960]  And it's so awkward.
[1:30:12.960 --> 1:30:14.960]  And like you said, where they've switched to this thing
[1:30:14.960 --> 1:30:17.960]  where they'll ship stuff at WDC and software,
[1:30:17.960 --> 1:30:19.960]  and then the hardware that comes out later in a year,
[1:30:19.960 --> 1:30:21.960]  it's like, oh, yeah, that's why they did that.
[1:30:21.960 --> 1:30:27.960]  Well, the stuff about multiple screen sizes is so obvious,
[1:30:27.960 --> 1:30:30.960]  but they can't say, well, they won't say anything.
[1:30:30.960 --> 1:30:31.960]  Well, right.
[1:30:31.960 --> 1:30:33.960]  Well, right.
[1:30:33.960 --> 1:30:35.960]  They're not going to say, hey, we might be shipping iPhones
[1:30:35.960 --> 1:30:38.960]  with new pixel dimensions or new physical size.
[1:30:38.960 --> 1:30:42.960]  Or we might, when we unveil the iPad later,
[1:30:42.960 --> 1:30:47.960]  new iPads later this year have a show a new feature
[1:30:47.960 --> 1:30:50.960]  where you can run to apps side by side.
[1:30:50.960 --> 1:30:53.960]  They just say like, hey, in theory,
[1:30:53.960 --> 1:30:55.960]  you might want to support these new,
[1:30:55.960 --> 1:30:57.960]  they call it adaptive apps.
[1:30:57.960 --> 1:31:00.960]  And it's sort of like a responsive,
[1:31:00.960 --> 1:31:02.960]  responsive layout is to web design.
[1:31:02.960 --> 1:31:03.960]  Right, where it works.
[1:31:03.960 --> 1:31:05.960]  Whatever the screen size is, it'll still work
[1:31:05.960 --> 1:31:09.960]  and look as if it was made natively for that size.
[1:31:09.960 --> 1:31:14.960]  Right, and that they're switching from a model
[1:31:14.960 --> 1:31:17.960]  where there are two sizes you need to worry about.
[1:31:17.960 --> 1:31:20.960]  iPhone size and iPad size.
[1:31:20.960 --> 1:31:23.960]  And horizontal and vertical layout.
[1:31:23.960 --> 1:31:25.960]  And then a little asterisk for iPhone
[1:31:25.960 --> 1:31:28.960]  because there's still older ones that have a 3.5 inch
[1:31:28.960 --> 1:31:29.960]  instead of a four inch.
[1:31:29.960 --> 1:31:31.960]  But they really just added pixels to the top.
[1:31:31.960 --> 1:31:33.960]  They didn't really create a new,
[1:31:33.960 --> 1:31:35.960]  everything stayed exactly the same size.
[1:31:35.960 --> 1:31:36.960]  They just got taller.
[1:31:36.960 --> 1:31:39.960]  Yeah, just got taller.
[1:31:39.960 --> 1:31:41.960]  They're switching to a system
[1:31:41.960 --> 1:31:45.960]  where there's these one third width, half width,
[1:31:45.960 --> 1:31:47.960]  full width, two thirds width,
[1:31:47.960 --> 1:31:51.960]  and like the iPhone is considered a one third width.
[1:31:51.960 --> 1:31:53.960]  And so it just seems pretty,
[1:31:53.960 --> 1:31:55.960]  like without saying, hey, we might do this,
[1:31:55.960 --> 1:31:57.960]  they're telling you that your apps,
[1:31:57.960 --> 1:32:00.960]  everybody should watch the State of the Union
[1:32:00.960 --> 1:32:02.960]  and they talk about this.
[1:32:02.960 --> 1:32:04.960]  And it's interesting both in terms of thinking
[1:32:04.960 --> 1:32:07.960]  about how it might work as a user and developer
[1:32:07.960 --> 1:32:09.960]  and how it might, you know,
[1:32:09.960 --> 1:32:12.960]  but it's also interesting as anybody's ever spoken publicly
[1:32:12.960 --> 1:32:14.960]  or is careful with their words
[1:32:14.960 --> 1:32:17.960]  to look at the condition that they're jumping through.
[1:32:17.960 --> 1:32:19.960]  Yeah, and they do it pretty well,
[1:32:19.960 --> 1:32:23.960]  but it's so hard, it'll make you laugh.
[1:32:23.960 --> 1:32:25.960]  It's really kind of funny and I almost feel bad for them.
[1:32:25.960 --> 1:32:27.960]  And then there's a whole session.
[1:32:27.960 --> 1:32:28.960]  I haven't actually watched it yet,
[1:32:28.960 --> 1:32:30.960]  but it's building adaptive apps
[1:32:30.960 --> 1:32:33.960]  with the UIKit session 216.
[1:32:33.960 --> 1:32:35.960]  And the thing that's interesting too,
[1:32:35.960 --> 1:32:38.960]  and I still feel like this hasn't really gotten
[1:32:38.960 --> 1:32:39.960]  through to everybody yet.
[1:32:39.960 --> 1:32:41.960]  There's no NDA this year.
[1:32:41.960 --> 1:32:45.960]  Like everybody can just go to developer.apple.com
[1:32:45.960 --> 1:32:48.960]  or just Google WWDC 2014 videos,
[1:32:48.960 --> 1:32:50.960]  it's easier, but it's slash videos,
[1:32:50.960 --> 1:32:52.960]  slash WWDC's slash 2014.
[1:32:52.960 --> 1:32:54.960]  And I have all the videos from WWDC
[1:32:54.960 --> 1:32:57.960]  and you don't even need an ADC account.
[1:32:57.960 --> 1:32:58.960]  You don't have to log in,
[1:32:58.960 --> 1:33:01.960]  you just click the video you want and start watching it.
[1:33:01.960 --> 1:33:03.960]  Everybody, you don't even have to sign up for a developer account.
[1:33:03.960 --> 1:33:05.960]  You can just go watch session 216
[1:33:05.960 --> 1:33:07.960]  and see them talk about it.
[1:33:07.960 --> 1:33:10.960]  Yeah, I had a note that I wanted to mention
[1:33:10.960 --> 1:33:13.960]  that it's interesting that the NDA has been lifted
[1:33:13.960 --> 1:33:15.960]  on all of this.
[1:33:15.960 --> 1:33:18.960]  And they just before the conference
[1:33:18.960 --> 1:33:21.960]  talked about how there can be access
[1:33:21.960 --> 1:33:23.960]  to betas of the OS.
[1:33:23.960 --> 1:33:27.960]  But as a developer, it's tremendously annoying
[1:33:27.960 --> 1:33:30.960]  to have even more people running a beta OS.
[1:33:30.960 --> 1:33:33.960]  That's interesting.
[1:33:33.960 --> 1:33:36.960]  That occurred to me.
[1:33:36.960 --> 1:33:39.960]  And it's, yeah, I thought about that.
[1:33:39.960 --> 1:33:43.960]  But as my personal interest
[1:33:43.960 --> 1:33:45.960]  as a developer at Qbranch,
[1:33:45.960 --> 1:33:46.960]  we're still iOS only.
[1:33:46.960 --> 1:33:49.960]  And iOS is not having a public beta
[1:33:49.960 --> 1:33:51.960]  whereas at Rogan Meeba.
[1:33:51.960 --> 1:33:55.960]  The Macs you guys are almost all Mac
[1:33:55.960 --> 1:33:57.960]  and is it all Mac?
[1:33:57.960 --> 1:33:59.960]  I guess have something for them.
[1:33:59.960 --> 1:34:01.960]  But for the most part, though, the company,
[1:34:01.960 --> 1:34:05.960]  it's a Mac company with some toes dipped in the iOS pool.
[1:34:05.960 --> 1:34:08.960]  And you guys are going to have people running
[1:34:08.960 --> 1:34:10.960]  the public beta of the OS.
[1:34:10.960 --> 1:34:13.960]  And people always did this
[1:34:13.960 --> 1:34:15.960]  who I don't want to say shouldn't have,
[1:34:15.960 --> 1:34:18.960]  but didn't necessarily need to.
[1:34:18.960 --> 1:34:21.960]  And it was always a little bit of a struggle
[1:34:21.960 --> 1:34:24.960]  because we'd have to say we're not there yet.
[1:34:24.960 --> 1:34:25.960]  We're working on it.
[1:34:25.960 --> 1:34:28.960]  But if you need your stuff to work on a daily basis,
[1:34:28.960 --> 1:34:32.960]  on a beta OS, I mean, that's just good advice in general, right?
[1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:35.960]  Yeah, it's definitely a good advice in day.
[1:34:35.960 --> 1:34:37.960]  Anybody out there who's thinking about participating
[1:34:37.960 --> 1:34:40.960]  in the Yosemite public beta, you know, was right.
[1:34:40.960 --> 1:34:43.960]  I mean, if you not, we're not saying don't do it.
[1:34:43.960 --> 1:34:45.960]  I'm saying no, you've got to take responsibility for it.
[1:34:45.960 --> 1:34:46.960]  That's exactly it.
[1:34:46.960 --> 1:34:48.960]  And you've got to take responsibility for what?
[1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:50.960]  And the more people that are doing it,
[1:34:50.960 --> 1:34:52.960]  the more emails we're going to get that say,
[1:34:52.960 --> 1:34:53.960]  you know, this isn't working, whatever.
[1:34:53.960 --> 1:34:56.960]  And we want to support these people as soon as we can,
[1:34:56.960 --> 1:34:59.960]  but we also have limited resources.
[1:34:59.960 --> 1:35:00.960]  And so I don't know if this,
[1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:02.960]  I don't know if this will help Apple or not
[1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:04.960]  because I think they had pretty good testing
[1:35:04.960 --> 1:35:08.960]  both internally and from developers in previous years.
[1:35:08.960 --> 1:35:10.960]  So I'm not really sure what they're striving for
[1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:14.960]  with this sort of change to opening it up a little bit more.
[1:35:14.960 --> 1:35:18.960]  In theory, if there's something stupid simple
[1:35:18.960 --> 1:35:21.960]  that's like really just like a line of code
[1:35:21.960 --> 1:35:23.960]  and you know what did it odd that?
[1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:26.960]  It's a nice thing we could do this and maybe we'll ship a point
[1:35:26.960 --> 1:35:29.960]  one update and it'll make things run better
[1:35:29.960 --> 1:35:32.960]  on Yosemite public beta.
[1:35:32.960 --> 1:35:34.960]  Sure, you might do that.
[1:35:34.960 --> 1:35:35.960]  You could do that.
[1:35:35.960 --> 1:35:38.960]  Even if there was no public beta,
[1:35:38.960 --> 1:35:42.960]  might roll out public updates of your apps over summer.
[1:35:42.960 --> 1:35:44.960]  If you can work one in that does make things better
[1:35:44.960 --> 1:35:45.960]  under Yosemite, you'll do it.
[1:35:45.960 --> 1:35:47.960]  You might have done it anyway because it'll help you
[1:35:47.960 --> 1:35:49.960]  because you'll be running it.
[1:35:49.960 --> 1:35:52.960]  But you can't run your company.
[1:35:52.960 --> 1:35:55.960]  You can't support a beta operating system.
[1:35:55.960 --> 1:35:57.960]  No, and that's exactly it.
[1:35:57.960 --> 1:35:59.960]  I don't know what Apple is hoping to accomplish with this
[1:35:59.960 --> 1:36:02.960]  and I hope they do get something out of it,
[1:36:02.960 --> 1:36:05.960]  but it's definitely frustrating for us as developers.
[1:36:05.960 --> 1:36:08.960]  Because ideally you're going to want to support Yosemite
[1:36:08.960 --> 1:36:11.960]  either when it officially ships out of beta
[1:36:11.960 --> 1:36:14.960]  or soon thereafter with all of your main possible.
[1:36:14.960 --> 1:36:16.960]  All right, day one, if possible,
[1:36:16.960 --> 1:36:18.960]  if not as soon afterwards as possible.
[1:36:18.960 --> 1:36:20.960]  But that's because once it's out of beta,
[1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:22.960]  it's a stable target.
[1:36:22.960 --> 1:36:25.960]  That's the thing to make a great point there.
[1:36:25.960 --> 1:36:28.960]  Right now, it's completely all over the map
[1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:31.960]  and things can change drastically between releases
[1:36:31.960 --> 1:36:34.960]  and trying to track every single one of those changes
[1:36:34.960 --> 1:36:36.960]  across weekly or monthly releases
[1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:38.960]  before it's in the public's hands
[1:36:38.960 --> 1:36:40.960]  is not a good way to run a company.
[1:36:40.960 --> 1:36:43.960]  Right, you can't target a moving target.
[1:36:43.960 --> 1:36:44.960]  Well, you could.
[1:36:44.960 --> 1:36:45.960]  You can try to.
[1:36:45.960 --> 1:36:46.960]  It's way more worse.
[1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:48.960]  You'll end up wasting time.
[1:36:48.960 --> 1:36:51.960]  And it could be something like a cosmetic bug.
[1:36:51.960 --> 1:36:55.960]  This doesn't look good because it doesn't render well
[1:36:55.960 --> 1:36:57.960]  on the transparent such and such.
[1:36:57.960 --> 1:36:58.960]  Right.
[1:36:58.960 --> 1:36:59.960]  And it ends up by the time it ships,
[1:36:59.960 --> 1:37:02.960]  it's no longer even transparent because they've changed it.
[1:37:02.960 --> 1:37:05.960]  Right, and you spent time fixing it for two weeks worth of...
[1:37:05.960 --> 1:37:06.960]  Right, yeah.
[1:37:06.960 --> 1:37:07.960]  So anyway.
[1:37:07.960 --> 1:37:09.960]  And you cannot do it.
[1:37:09.960 --> 1:37:11.960]  And again, I've been there like,
[1:37:11.960 --> 1:37:13.960]  but even way back when I was at bare bones,
[1:37:13.960 --> 1:37:17.960]  we went through it with BV-ed it on the public beta of Mac OS X.
[1:37:17.960 --> 1:37:19.960]  Well, but I mean that,
[1:37:19.960 --> 1:37:21.960]  are you talking pre 10.0,
[1:37:21.960 --> 1:37:23.960]  the actual public beta's then?
[1:37:23.960 --> 1:37:26.960]  Because those were actually almost releases.
[1:37:26.960 --> 1:37:29.960]  That's probably a bad example because
[1:37:29.960 --> 1:37:31.960]  I think we only had the only way
[1:37:31.960 --> 1:37:34.960]  we only had the native carbon version of BV-ed it
[1:37:34.960 --> 1:37:35.960]  was internally beta tested.
[1:37:35.960 --> 1:37:37.960]  We didn't have a public beta of that.
[1:37:37.960 --> 1:37:40.960]  But there I remember though being at bare bones though,
[1:37:40.960 --> 1:37:43.960]  maybe not the 10-0, but like 10-1 and 10-2.
[1:37:43.960 --> 1:37:48.960]  And even before the even the betas of Mac OS 9,
[1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:51.960]  the various updates to it that we'd get bug reports
[1:37:51.960 --> 1:37:53.960]  from people who were running it.
[1:37:53.960 --> 1:37:55.960]  And it's like, thanks for filing the bug.
[1:37:55.960 --> 1:37:56.960]  We do appreciate that.
[1:37:56.960 --> 1:37:57.960]  Report the bug.
[1:37:57.960 --> 1:38:00.960]  But don't expect us to have this fixed
[1:38:00.960 --> 1:38:03.960]  on the schedule that we would for a similar bug
[1:38:03.960 --> 1:38:04.960]  on a shipping version of that.
[1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:06.960]  Yeah, that's exactly it.
[1:38:06.960 --> 1:38:07.960]  Right.
[1:38:07.960 --> 1:38:08.960]  Anyway.
[1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:09.960]  Yeah, it's interesting.
[1:38:09.960 --> 1:38:11.960]  I'm interested to see how that aspect of it plays out
[1:38:11.960 --> 1:38:12.960]  and how popular the public beta is.
[1:38:12.960 --> 1:38:14.960]  Well, I should, you know, I mentioned this,
[1:38:14.960 --> 1:38:16.960]  but I should say it hasn't been a huge issue.
[1:38:16.960 --> 1:38:18.960]  It's not as if we've seen it influx of people
[1:38:18.960 --> 1:38:20.960]  running this who shouldn't be or, you know.
[1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:22.960]  Ah, but they haven't started the public beta yet.
[1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:25.960]  For Yosemite, there's none right now at all.
[1:38:25.960 --> 1:38:26.960]  I don't know.
[1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:27.960]  Okay.
[1:38:27.960 --> 1:38:28.960]  Am I wrong?
[1:38:28.960 --> 1:38:29.960]  Well, then I guess we'll see.
[1:38:29.960 --> 1:38:32.960]  Like I said, I'm sort of out of it as far as dubbed that goes.
[1:38:32.960 --> 1:38:34.960]  You'll know in the next episode of the talk show
[1:38:34.960 --> 1:38:35.960]  if I start by apologizing.
[1:38:35.960 --> 1:38:38.960]  I'm nearly certain that the public beta hasn't started.
[1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:39.960]  You may well be right.
[1:38:39.960 --> 1:38:41.960]  I mean, I'm running it on one of my machines,
[1:38:41.960 --> 1:38:44.960]  but that doesn't mean, you know, I got it from the developers area.
[1:38:44.960 --> 1:38:45.960]  Yeah.
[1:38:45.960 --> 1:38:48.960]  My hope is that they're waiting for a significantly better.
[1:38:48.960 --> 1:38:51.960]  I think that the two betas are actually pretty good for June.
[1:38:51.960 --> 1:38:52.960]  Right.
[1:38:52.960 --> 1:38:54.960]  You know, both iOS 8 and Yosemite.
[1:38:54.960 --> 1:38:58.960]  I've got machines, I've got devices running both here.
[1:38:58.960 --> 1:39:00.960]  And they're both pretty good for June betas.
[1:39:00.960 --> 1:39:02.960]  Especially compared to past years.
[1:39:02.960 --> 1:39:03.960]  Yeah.
[1:39:03.960 --> 1:39:05.960]  Past years, the June ones have usually been unused.
[1:39:05.960 --> 1:39:06.960]  Right.
[1:39:06.960 --> 1:39:08.960]  You know, it's like I'll come back to it in mid July
[1:39:08.960 --> 1:39:09.960]  when they've got it.
[1:39:09.960 --> 1:39:12.960]  To me, they seem like they're ahead of where they've been in the past years,
[1:39:12.960 --> 1:39:15.960]  but I wouldn't recommend them to anybody to depend on.
[1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:19.960]  No, and there's a big thing is that a lot of the time,
[1:39:19.960 --> 1:39:22.960]  the features that they've talked about aren't in there yet.
[1:39:22.960 --> 1:39:24.960]  Yes, that's absolutely right.
[1:39:24.960 --> 1:39:26.960]  So you want to run these and see like, oh, they talked about this new stuff.
[1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:27.960]  I want to see it.
[1:39:27.960 --> 1:39:30.960]  And then you, if you install it, you're not actually going to see it for another month
[1:39:30.960 --> 1:39:32.960]  because it's not there yet.
[1:39:32.960 --> 1:39:33.960]  So I don't know.
[1:39:33.960 --> 1:39:36.960]  I'm optimistic that they're I'm curious about it, though,
[1:39:36.960 --> 1:39:40.960]  because it does seem, it does seem to be of a piece with this whole opening
[1:39:40.960 --> 1:39:44.960]  up of Apple, you know, that they're a little bit, you know,
[1:39:44.960 --> 1:39:48.960]  not in a radical departure, but in a slight shift, of course, you know,
[1:39:48.960 --> 1:39:54.960]  Angela Arnt's had a LinkedIn blog post yesterday on what it's like to be starting a new job
[1:39:54.960 --> 1:39:55.960]  but a new company.
[1:39:55.960 --> 1:39:59.960]  It wasn't particularly revealing in about Apple.
[1:39:59.960 --> 1:40:00.960]  It was, you know, right.
[1:40:00.960 --> 1:40:02.960]  And it was, you know, there were no secrets.
[1:40:02.960 --> 1:40:05.960]  There was nothing gossipy or shocking or notable.
[1:40:05.960 --> 1:40:08.960]  It was, you know, well written and interesting.
[1:40:08.960 --> 1:40:12.960]  It's an interesting perspective, but the thing that's most interesting is that
[1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:16.960]  a senior vice president at Apple posted a, here's what I'm up to,
[1:40:16.960 --> 1:40:18.960]  on LinkedIn, LinkedIn, right.
[1:40:18.960 --> 1:40:20.960]  Which has never happened before.
[1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:25.960]  Not just LinkedIn, but on any kind of social network or blog or anything.
[1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:29.960]  Well, besides when Steve Jobs was blogging on Apple.com.
[1:40:29.960 --> 1:40:32.960]  Yeah, but even then it wasn't on personal.
[1:40:32.960 --> 1:40:36.960]  It was, right. It was like two times in the entire history of Apple.
[1:40:36.960 --> 1:40:39.960]  Steve Jobs wrote, you know, here's something, you know,
[1:40:39.960 --> 1:40:43.960]  here's something you've bastard to make me actually.
[1:40:43.960 --> 1:40:46.960]  Thoughts on music and then thoughts on flash.
[1:40:46.960 --> 1:40:47.960]  That's right. That was the other one.
[1:40:47.960 --> 1:40:48.960]  Flash.
[1:40:48.960 --> 1:40:49.960]  Yeah.
[1:40:49.960 --> 1:40:50.960]  How'd that work out?
[1:40:50.960 --> 1:40:52.960]  We have flash on the iPhone yet.
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:55.960]  You know, that's people.
[1:40:55.960 --> 1:40:57.960]  Somebody emailed me about that.
[1:40:57.960 --> 1:40:59.960]  There's some reader wanting me to do like a claim challenge
[1:40:59.960 --> 1:41:03.960]  right up on mobile flash because the people who were adamant that it was
[1:41:03.960 --> 1:41:05.960]  it could never be a success without it.
[1:41:05.960 --> 1:41:06.960]  Right.
[1:41:06.960 --> 1:41:12.960]  Seemed to have conveniently lost their, lost their interest in the cause.
[1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:13.960]  Right.
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:14.960]  No, I don't believe so.
[1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:15.960]  I'm more curious.
[1:41:15.960 --> 1:41:18.960]  Are there any devices you can go out and buy today that have to do?
[1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:22.960]  Do you have flash right through the Android to current Android devices have it or?
[1:41:22.960 --> 1:41:23.960]  Right. I don't think so.
[1:41:23.960 --> 1:41:27.960]  I think you'd have to buy like a super low end Android phone that's running
[1:41:27.960 --> 1:41:29.960]  an ancient version of Android.
[1:41:29.960 --> 1:41:31.960]  You know, to get it like a two point something version.
[1:41:31.960 --> 1:41:35.960]  I don't think Android supported it an entire 4.0 version.
[1:41:35.960 --> 1:41:38.960]  And at 4.0 is a couple years old.
[1:41:38.960 --> 1:41:39.960]  Yeah.
[1:41:39.960 --> 1:41:40.960]  Everybody's given up on it.
[1:41:40.960 --> 1:41:41.960]  All right.
[1:41:41.960 --> 1:41:42.960]  I don't even know blackberry still supports it.
[1:41:42.960 --> 1:41:45.960]  Well, they just had some new phones, didn't they?
[1:41:45.960 --> 1:41:46.960]  Yeah.
[1:41:46.960 --> 1:41:48.960]  It's funny.
[1:41:48.960 --> 1:41:53.960]  It's funny how hard it is for a company to actually like the candle to actually go out.
[1:41:53.960 --> 1:41:54.960]  Right.
[1:41:54.960 --> 1:42:00.960]  Well, it's like, do you remember the loads this like lawsuits against
[1:42:00.960 --> 1:42:02.960]  Unix and Linux?
[1:42:02.960 --> 1:42:06.960]  This is this is they were suing Linux and maybe Unix.
[1:42:06.960 --> 1:42:09.960]  I forget what the deal was that they owned some piece of Unix.
[1:42:09.960 --> 1:42:12.960]  And therefore, we're suing Linux, I think, was the deal.
[1:42:12.960 --> 1:42:15.960]  And these lawsuits went on for like a decade.
[1:42:15.960 --> 1:42:18.960]  And they kept losing them, but they kept filing them.
[1:42:18.960 --> 1:42:22.960]  And it was always a concern that, you know, this was going to impact something
[1:42:22.960 --> 1:42:28.960]  like Android, where it's actually, even if it's not true Linux, it's built around it.
[1:42:28.960 --> 1:42:32.960]  And if one of these lawsuits was successful, suddenly somebody might be taking a huge chunk of
[1:42:32.960 --> 1:42:34.960]  money out of some big company.
[1:42:34.960 --> 1:42:35.960]  And yeah.
[1:42:35.960 --> 1:42:40.960]  Anyway, the point was that it took over a decade, I think, before they, as you said,
[1:42:40.960 --> 1:42:44.960]  the candle finally went out and they finally gave up and said, all right, we're done.
[1:42:44.960 --> 1:42:48.960]  And it's a similar thing with blackberry, where the company is just limping along.
[1:42:48.960 --> 1:42:51.960]  And I mean, they must have had some money in the bank too, the way Apple does.
[1:42:51.960 --> 1:42:52.960]  Not to that extent.
[1:42:52.960 --> 1:42:53.960]  But.
[1:42:53.960 --> 1:42:54.960]  Yeah, I guess so.
[1:42:54.960 --> 1:42:55.960]  I don't know.
[1:42:55.960 --> 1:42:57.960]  It's just, it's, I don't know.
[1:42:57.960 --> 1:43:00.960]  I expected something spectacular to have happened by now.
[1:43:00.960 --> 1:43:04.960]  Either like we're out, we're turning out the lights and we're, we've sold our, you know,
[1:43:04.960 --> 1:43:11.960]  the way I expected to go is we've sold ourselves to, I don't know, LG or HTC.
[1:43:11.960 --> 1:43:12.960]  I don't know.
[1:43:12.960 --> 1:43:14.960]  Somebody like that, we've sold ourselves to.
[1:43:14.960 --> 1:43:17.960]  And now blackberry's just a name that's owned by this other company.
[1:43:17.960 --> 1:43:20.960]  Like Napster got sold a couple times that way.
[1:43:20.960 --> 1:43:21.960]  Yeah.
[1:43:21.960 --> 1:43:23.960]  But it hasn't happened yet.
[1:43:23.960 --> 1:43:26.960]  And yet, you know, like you said, they're still coming out with new phones and it's like,
[1:43:26.960 --> 1:43:28.960]  I feel sorry for them.
[1:43:28.960 --> 1:43:29.960]  I don't know.
[1:43:29.960 --> 1:43:30.960]  Anybody who's still left.
[1:43:30.960 --> 1:43:31.960]  They don't look terrible.
[1:43:31.960 --> 1:43:35.960]  They look, but they don't look at at least a bit competitive with everything else.
[1:43:35.960 --> 1:43:36.960]  Right.
[1:43:36.960 --> 1:43:38.960]  Or Palm, you know, right?
[1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:40.960]  Like Palm just disappeared.
[1:43:40.960 --> 1:43:43.960]  You know, it's like I've thought something would have happened by now.
[1:43:43.960 --> 1:43:46.960]  You know, that blackberry's going to, you know, either disappear.
[1:43:46.960 --> 1:43:48.960]  Palm got bought by HP, right?
[1:43:48.960 --> 1:43:49.960]  Yeah.
[1:43:49.960 --> 1:43:50.960]  Yeah.
[1:43:50.960 --> 1:43:51.960]  I think that's where they went.
[1:43:51.960 --> 1:43:57.960]  I know HPE wound up with them at some point because the tablet size ones were HP device.
[1:43:57.960 --> 1:43:58.960]  Right.
[1:43:58.960 --> 1:43:59.960]  What were they called?
[1:43:59.960 --> 1:44:00.960]  Touchpad.
[1:44:00.960 --> 1:44:01.960]  Yeah, I think that's right.
[1:44:01.960 --> 1:44:04.960]  But yeah, blackberry's limping along still.
[1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:05.960]  And that was the thing.
[1:44:05.960 --> 1:44:07.960]  I was surprised to see this announcement.
[1:44:07.960 --> 1:44:08.960]  I think it was this week or last week.
[1:44:08.960 --> 1:44:10.960]  And I haven't even looked at the phones.
[1:44:10.960 --> 1:44:12.960]  But I've never been interested.
[1:44:12.960 --> 1:44:15.960]  But it's interesting that they're still able to put something out.
[1:44:15.960 --> 1:44:16.960]  Yeah.
[1:44:16.960 --> 1:44:20.960]  But I don't, you know, you never, just walking around the city and never see blackberry
[1:44:20.960 --> 1:44:22.960]  posters in the carrier stores anymore or anything.
[1:44:22.960 --> 1:44:23.960]  Right.
[1:44:23.960 --> 1:44:25.960]  You know, it's almost like they're not there.
[1:44:25.960 --> 1:44:27.960]  I mean, I'm sure you can go in and buy one.
[1:44:27.960 --> 1:44:28.960]  But I don't know.
[1:44:28.960 --> 1:44:32.960]  I would guess that most of the ones that are still being sold are like the old style ones.
[1:44:32.960 --> 1:44:33.960]  Not the new...
[1:44:33.960 --> 1:44:35.960]  With the keyboard versus the touch screen, you mean?
[1:44:35.960 --> 1:44:36.960]  Yeah.
[1:44:36.960 --> 1:44:37.960]  Right.
[1:44:37.960 --> 1:44:40.960]  The ones that, you know, people who are just blackberry die-hards who just skipped out on the whole
[1:44:40.960 --> 1:44:45.960]  iOS and type computing thing and still just, they just want a replacement for the blackberry
[1:44:45.960 --> 1:44:46.960]  that...
[1:44:46.960 --> 1:44:47.960]  Right.
[1:44:47.960 --> 1:44:48.960]  Right.
[1:44:48.960 --> 1:44:49.960]  Which isn't unreasonable.
[1:44:49.960 --> 1:44:50.960]  It's not a good business going forward.
[1:44:50.960 --> 1:44:51.960]  But it's...
[1:44:51.960 --> 1:44:54.960]  No, but if you have something that works and then it eventually breaks because it's been five
[1:44:54.960 --> 1:44:57.960]  years, you may well want the exact same thing.
[1:44:57.960 --> 1:44:58.960]  Right.
[1:44:58.960 --> 1:44:59.960]  I totally understand that mindset.
[1:44:59.960 --> 1:45:04.960]  I mean, I personally, obviously don't, you know, when it comes to phones, I don't feel that
[1:45:04.960 --> 1:45:05.960]  way.
[1:45:05.960 --> 1:45:08.960]  But there's other things in my life that if it breaks, I just want to buy the exact same thing.
[1:45:08.960 --> 1:45:10.960]  Goddamn keyboard, John.
[1:45:10.960 --> 1:45:11.960]  Exactly.
[1:45:11.960 --> 1:45:12.960]  My keyboard.
[1:45:12.960 --> 1:45:15.960]  It's the same, I bought like four or five pairs of the same stuff.
[1:45:15.960 --> 1:45:16.960]  Okay.
[1:45:16.960 --> 1:45:17.960]  Yeah.
[1:45:17.960 --> 1:45:18.960]  I don't care what the new sneakers are.
[1:45:18.960 --> 1:45:21.960]  Just give me a new pair of the samba millimeter.
[1:45:21.960 --> 1:45:22.960]  Right.
[1:45:22.960 --> 1:45:23.960]  Right.
[1:45:23.960 --> 1:45:24.960]  Or whatever they're called.
[1:45:24.960 --> 1:45:25.960]  All right.
[1:45:25.960 --> 1:45:26.960]  I think that's it for my list this week.
[1:45:26.960 --> 1:45:27.960]  Good show.
[1:45:27.960 --> 1:45:28.960]  All right.
[1:45:28.960 --> 1:45:29.960]  Well, I got one more for you.
[1:45:29.960 --> 1:45:30.960]  You got a topic.
[1:45:30.960 --> 1:45:31.960]  You got something.
[1:45:31.960 --> 1:45:32.960]  I do have a little bonus.
[1:45:32.960 --> 1:45:33.960]  I do have a little bonus.
[1:45:33.960 --> 1:45:34.960]  And this is important to me.
[1:45:34.960 --> 1:45:35.960]  Did you see...
[1:45:35.960 --> 1:45:36.960]  It was last week.
[1:45:36.960 --> 1:45:39.960]  Did you see the announcement of these new emoji?
[1:45:39.960 --> 1:45:40.960]  Emoji.
[1:45:40.960 --> 1:45:41.960]  No.
[1:45:41.960 --> 1:45:42.960]  No, I didn't.
[1:45:42.960 --> 1:45:44.960]  I saw that there were, but I didn't see what was going on.
[1:45:44.960 --> 1:45:45.960]  Okay.
[1:45:45.960 --> 1:45:46.960]  Well, so there's two things actually.
[1:45:46.960 --> 1:45:51.840]  iOS 8 makes it promotes emoji to like a top level keyboard now.
[1:45:51.840 --> 1:45:55.960]  So instead of by default, it used to be you had to turn on the emoji keyboard.
[1:45:55.960 --> 1:45:56.960]  Oh, right.
[1:45:56.960 --> 1:45:57.960]  Yeah.
[1:45:57.960 --> 1:46:01.200]  And now iOS 8 has it there by default for everybody, which is actually a little bit interesting
[1:46:01.200 --> 1:46:05.320]  because it indicates Apple feels this is part of the culture now.
[1:46:05.320 --> 1:46:08.320]  The same way like punctuation is almost.
[1:46:08.320 --> 1:46:10.320]  So I thought that was kind of interesting.
[1:46:10.320 --> 1:46:11.320]  Right.
[1:46:11.320 --> 1:46:12.320]  That's exactly it.
[1:46:12.320 --> 1:46:15.920]  Instead of hitting the globe and pulling up other keyboards, you just hit the smiley button
[1:46:15.920 --> 1:46:17.760]  basically.
[1:46:17.760 --> 1:46:18.760]  But yeah.
[1:46:18.760 --> 1:46:25.000]  So last week, the standard got released for like 240, 250 new emoji.
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:31.200]  And the way that it works is that each platform, Apple, Android, Twitter has to then create
[1:46:31.200 --> 1:46:36.160]  illustrations for this and make it part of their OS or part of their platform.
[1:46:36.160 --> 1:46:40.800]  And I wrote about this today, but the one that I'm very excited about, and I'm a little
[1:46:40.800 --> 1:46:46.400]  worried about is there is now going to be a middle finger emoji is there is a, I forget
[1:46:46.400 --> 1:46:52.400]  the exact name, but it's it's hand with middle finger raised, you know, they have longer
[1:46:52.400 --> 1:46:53.400]  names.
[1:46:53.400 --> 1:46:57.400]  I'm looking at your website now.
[1:46:57.400 --> 1:46:58.400]  There you go.
[1:46:58.400 --> 1:46:59.400]  Yeah.
[1:46:59.400 --> 1:47:02.040]  So it's what's it called?
[1:47:02.040 --> 1:47:04.080]  Reverse hand with middle finger extended.
[1:47:04.080 --> 1:47:08.320]  And it's, you know, it's a hand flip in the bird.
[1:47:08.320 --> 1:47:13.120]  Now my concern though, and this is a question for you, is Apple going to include this?
[1:47:13.120 --> 1:47:16.840]  Oh, now that's a fascinating question.
[1:47:16.840 --> 1:47:20.560]  This is why, this is why you put Paul Kavasas on your, on your show.
[1:47:20.560 --> 1:47:22.640]  That's a damn good question, Paul.
[1:47:22.640 --> 1:47:28.840]  Because Apple, you know, they've got the pile of poo in there, but at the same time,
[1:47:28.840 --> 1:47:31.080]  their app store is fairly restrictive.
[1:47:31.080 --> 1:47:32.560]  There's no pornography in there.
[1:47:32.560 --> 1:47:35.960]  There's no risque content.
[1:47:35.960 --> 1:47:42.480]  There's pile of poo is the, is the emoji, emoji description pile that is the actual name
[1:47:42.480 --> 1:47:43.480]  of it.
[1:47:43.480 --> 1:47:45.480]  Yeah, if you look in the unicorn table, it's called pile of poo.
[1:47:45.480 --> 1:47:50.920]  So, and so there's no, no reason that you would have to turn it into a googly eyed smiley
[1:47:50.920 --> 1:47:51.920]  face.
[1:47:51.920 --> 1:47:52.920]  No, it's not happy face.
[1:47:52.920 --> 1:47:54.080]  It's not happy pile of poo.
[1:47:54.080 --> 1:47:55.160]  It's not smiley pile of poo.
[1:47:55.160 --> 1:47:57.360]  It's literally just pile of poo.
[1:47:57.360 --> 1:48:02.280]  It could be an ugly ring smelly with flies buzzing around it.
[1:48:02.280 --> 1:48:06.520]  Yeah, like little little stink rays coming out of it, pile of poo.
[1:48:06.520 --> 1:48:12.440]  And instead, it's a very, very happy, you know, your, your, your, your doctor is going
[1:48:12.440 --> 1:48:14.040]  to be very happy with your school special.
[1:48:14.040 --> 1:48:18.920]  If it looked like this guy, yeah, yeah, you're eating well, you take care of yourself,
[1:48:18.920 --> 1:48:19.920]  you know?
[1:48:19.920 --> 1:48:23.520]  But so the, the, the thing is that, you know, they're restrictive in some regards and then
[1:48:23.520 --> 1:48:27.800]  not in others, but this is a standard.
[1:48:27.800 --> 1:48:31.480]  And they, the, what's interesting is that they were talking a couple months ago about introducing
[1:48:31.480 --> 1:48:36.240]  diversity into the emoji and they wanted to have, basically there's a whole lot of white
[1:48:36.240 --> 1:48:40.000]  people in the emoji, which is interesting because it comes from Japan.
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:45.680]  So it's a little strange, but Apple said, you know, we want to have other, other races
[1:48:45.680 --> 1:48:47.040]  represented in there.
[1:48:47.040 --> 1:48:51.520]  And they said they might just do it themselves and they can take instead of like smiling
[1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:58.320]  elderly person, they can make that a, a smiling elderly person of a different race.
[1:48:58.320 --> 1:49:03.840]  So I don't know, you know, they have the authority on their own platforms to make this
[1:49:03.840 --> 1:49:06.920]  not quite a middle finger, I think.
[1:49:06.920 --> 1:49:10.600]  And I'm worried that I'm going to have to switch to Android if this happens.
[1:49:10.600 --> 1:49:15.200]  Reverse hand with middle finger extended.
[1:49:15.200 --> 1:49:19.720]  Well, I mean, can you, can you draw that in a way that follows that guideline without it
[1:49:19.720 --> 1:49:20.720]  being a middle finger?
[1:49:20.720 --> 1:49:21.720]  Yeah.
[1:49:21.720 --> 1:49:25.480]  Well, look at that, you're obviously not an emoji lawyer as I am.
[1:49:25.480 --> 1:49:29.480]  I actually have a JD and emoji law.
[1:49:29.480 --> 1:49:32.920]  So reverse hand, you do need to show the back of the hand.
[1:49:32.920 --> 1:49:36.520]  The middle finger extended doesn't need to be extended, but there's no reason you couldn't
[1:49:36.520 --> 1:49:37.520]  have another finger.
[1:49:37.520 --> 1:49:38.520]  That's exactly it.
[1:49:38.520 --> 1:49:42.320]  You toss up another finger and it's, it's not incorrect.
[1:49:42.320 --> 1:49:44.200]  And then suddenly I'm not flipping somebody the bird.
[1:49:44.200 --> 1:49:45.480]  I'm giving them a peace sign.
[1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:46.480]  Right.
[1:49:46.480 --> 1:49:47.480]  Right.
[1:49:47.480 --> 1:49:50.520]  Yeah, exactly or, or a Spock sign.
[1:49:50.520 --> 1:49:52.040]  No, that, that is one of the new ones.
[1:49:52.040 --> 1:49:56.200]  I saw that one in that the, what I call that the Vulcan symbol.
[1:49:56.200 --> 1:49:57.640]  Yeah, that's already, that's already in it.
[1:49:57.640 --> 1:50:00.280]  A long and proper.
[1:50:00.280 --> 1:50:04.360]  I feel like you could officially comply with the description by putting another finger
[1:50:04.360 --> 1:50:05.360]  up there.
[1:50:05.360 --> 1:50:06.360]  I'm worried.
[1:50:06.360 --> 1:50:07.360]  I'm worried, John.
[1:50:07.360 --> 1:50:09.880]  That's a good question.
[1:50:09.880 --> 1:50:10.880]  What will I do?
[1:50:10.880 --> 1:50:11.880]  They got to do the right thing here.
[1:50:11.880 --> 1:50:13.880]  They got to give me the middle finger.
[1:50:13.880 --> 1:50:21.760]  Yeah, you know, it would be, it would, it would fit with, it wouldn't comply with the
[1:50:21.760 --> 1:50:22.760]  description at all.
[1:50:22.760 --> 1:50:31.480]  But it would fit with previous frustrations with similar curse words in, in prose, if they
[1:50:31.480 --> 1:50:35.120]  just replaced it with a picture of a doc.
[1:50:35.120 --> 1:50:36.120]  Right.
[1:50:36.120 --> 1:50:37.120]  Right.
[1:50:37.120 --> 1:50:38.120]  Right.
[1:50:38.120 --> 1:50:41.840]  You would go to insert this emoji and you get it.
[1:50:41.840 --> 1:50:43.040]  Just get a doc.
[1:50:43.040 --> 1:50:44.040]  Nice.
[1:50:44.040 --> 1:50:46.520]  That's my guess.
[1:50:46.520 --> 1:50:49.080]  My guess is they're just going to put a picture of a doc.
[1:50:49.080 --> 1:50:50.080]  Son of a bitch.
[1:50:50.080 --> 1:50:51.080]  We'll see.
[1:50:51.080 --> 1:50:54.480]  I'm hopeful.
[1:50:54.480 --> 1:50:55.480]  This is great.
[1:50:55.480 --> 1:50:57.280]  Now I'm on pins and needles to see how this turns out.
[1:50:57.280 --> 1:50:58.280]  It could be months.
[1:50:58.280 --> 1:50:59.280]  We don't know.
[1:50:59.280 --> 1:51:01.440]  Because the way the standard works, you know, it gets announced and then they implement
[1:51:01.440 --> 1:51:02.440]  it over time.
[1:51:02.440 --> 1:51:07.440]  So I don't know if it'll be part of iOS 8 or iOS 9, but I'm eager to see it and I hope
[1:51:07.440 --> 1:51:10.520]  we get what we deserve.
[1:51:10.520 --> 1:51:13.480]  Do you know if there was any controversy over this?
[1:51:13.480 --> 1:51:17.360]  You know, I didn't, not that I saw.
[1:51:17.360 --> 1:51:23.640]  It's a standard's body that, you know, the companies that comply to the standard still
[1:51:23.640 --> 1:51:26.400]  have a lot of leeway, rather.
[1:51:26.400 --> 1:51:29.240]  So if you look, you know, things look different on different platforms.
[1:51:29.240 --> 1:51:31.720]  So I'm going to go with no thing.
[1:51:31.720 --> 1:51:32.720]  Do you think they're not going to do it?
[1:51:32.720 --> 1:51:34.720]  I mean, they did pile of poo though.
[1:51:34.720 --> 1:51:38.560]  I wonder, would there be a way that they would add a parental control that you can
[1:51:38.560 --> 1:51:39.560]  hear?
[1:51:39.560 --> 1:51:40.560]  On your emoji keyboard?
[1:51:40.560 --> 1:51:41.560]  Right.
[1:51:41.560 --> 1:51:44.240]  Well, but the thing is that if you don't know what it means, then it's just a middle finger
[1:51:44.240 --> 1:51:45.240]  sticking up, right?
[1:51:45.240 --> 1:51:46.240]  I mean, it's not.
[1:51:46.240 --> 1:51:47.920]  Do they have other fingers?
[1:51:47.920 --> 1:51:50.000]  Can you get every single finger of that?
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:54.920]  I mean, there's already pointing fingers, like pointing with the pointer finger and up and
[1:51:54.920 --> 1:51:55.920]  down.
[1:51:55.920 --> 1:51:57.720]  And I don't know if there's one for every finger.
[1:51:57.720 --> 1:52:00.240]  I don't think there is.
[1:52:00.240 --> 1:52:03.840]  But I mean, like, you could just tell your kid, this is, this means one.
[1:52:03.840 --> 1:52:07.280]  Like, I mean, that's probably a bad lesson to teach your kid, I guess.
[1:52:07.280 --> 1:52:08.280]  Yeah.
[1:52:08.280 --> 1:52:09.280]  Yeah.
[1:52:09.280 --> 1:52:12.640]  Make sure you'd emphasize that lesson before the first day of kindergarten.
[1:52:12.640 --> 1:52:19.040]  This means one duck you paw, duck you John.
