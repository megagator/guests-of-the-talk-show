[00:00.000 --> 00:02.480]  Hey, man, how's the game?
[00:02.480 --> 00:04.120]  Well, it's funny watching baseball
[00:04.120 --> 00:06.600]  when you don't really have a vested interest
[00:06.600 --> 00:07.920]  in any of the particular teams.
[00:07.920 --> 00:11.600]  And then I develop a little mini interest in one of the teams.
[00:11.600 --> 00:14.680]  And it's like, I don't know, it's
[00:14.680 --> 00:17.180]  how it was we were talking about it during the World Cup, where
[00:17.180 --> 00:19.760]  two teams who you don't really care about start playing.
[00:19.760 --> 00:21.520]  And then one of them will do something,
[00:21.520 --> 00:23.520]  and it's like, that's my team.
[00:23.520 --> 00:27.800]  And then you're invested for, you're like a fan for an hour.
[00:27.800 --> 00:30.520]  Yeah, until the duration is over.
[00:30.520 --> 00:33.320]  And then there's penalty kicks, and you
[00:33.320 --> 00:35.240]  don't give a crap anymore.
[00:35.240 --> 00:41.080]  Now, I became a temporary fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers
[00:41.080 --> 00:43.320]  simply because their manager is Don Mattingly,
[00:43.320 --> 00:45.840]  who was on the Yankees when I was growing up.
[00:45.840 --> 00:48.840]  He was my boyhood Yankee title.
[00:48.840 --> 00:50.400]  That is very you think to do.
[00:50.400 --> 00:51.480]  That is so arbitrary.
[00:51.480 --> 00:52.400]  It's crazy.
[00:52.400 --> 00:54.480]  He was my favorite Yankee growing up.
[00:54.480 --> 00:55.360]  He was awesome.
[00:55.360 --> 00:56.440]  I always loved him.
[00:56.440 --> 00:57.760]  Do you call the managers Yankees?
[00:57.760 --> 01:01.440]  Like, that's if you're a player for the Yankees.
[01:01.440 --> 01:02.080]  Oh, he was.
[01:02.080 --> 01:02.760]  OK, I'm sorry.
[01:02.760 --> 01:03.800]  Yeah, he played first base.
[01:03.800 --> 01:05.960]  He was an all-star first baseman for the Yankees
[01:05.960 --> 01:10.720]  through the 80s, and then sort of a tragic career
[01:10.720 --> 01:14.480]  where he's, without doubt, the greatest New York
[01:14.480 --> 01:17.020]  Yankee who never won a World Series,
[01:17.020 --> 01:18.640]  and not only never won a World Series,
[01:18.640 --> 01:20.680]  he never won a playoff series.
[01:20.680 --> 01:23.960]  He played right after the Reggie Jackson era.
[01:23.960 --> 01:25.940]  Yankees had won some World Series,
[01:25.940 --> 01:28.440]  and then he played right through the 80s and the early 90s
[01:28.440 --> 01:30.600]  when the Yankees were actually pretty bad overall.
[01:30.600 --> 01:33.320]  He was like the star player on a pretty bad team.
[01:33.320 --> 01:35.800]  And then in his last season, and he got cut short,
[01:35.800 --> 01:38.200]  he had a relatively shorter career than most players.
[01:38.200 --> 01:40.960]  He had a bad back, 1995.
[01:40.960 --> 01:42.440]  From injury or just genetics?
[01:42.440 --> 01:44.240]  Yeah, well, just wear and tear.
[01:44.240 --> 01:45.020]  Yeah, who knows?
[01:45.020 --> 01:46.360]  He kind of had a funny batting stance
[01:46.360 --> 01:47.480]  where he squatted over.
[01:47.480 --> 01:48.640]  Maybe that contributed to it.
[01:48.640 --> 01:49.880]  But anyway, he had a bad back, so it
[01:49.880 --> 01:50.760]  was going to be his last year.
[01:50.760 --> 01:52.100]  And the Yankees made the playoffs
[01:52.100 --> 01:54.120]  for the first time in a long time,
[01:54.120 --> 01:58.520]  and they lost a game five in a five-game series
[01:58.520 --> 02:02.520]  to the Seattle Mariners, John Molta's team.
[02:02.520 --> 02:03.520]  That's not a real team.
[02:03.520 --> 02:04.720]  That's a Canadian team.
[02:04.720 --> 02:07.760]  Then he retired, and then starting in 96,
[02:07.760 --> 02:11.480]  the Yankees won four of the next five World Series.
[02:11.480 --> 02:12.960]  So it sort of is.
[02:12.960 --> 02:15.240]  Yeah, so he's sort of a tragic figure in my mind.
[02:15.240 --> 02:17.280]  And now he's managing the Dodgers, and they're.
[02:17.280 --> 02:21.160]  Yeah, but he's still working in the field.
[02:21.160 --> 02:23.040]  Not everybody gets to do that, right?
[02:23.040 --> 02:24.840]  Well, no, that's true, no.
[02:24.840 --> 02:27.440]  And they just, right before we started recording it,
[02:27.440 --> 02:29.520]  Los Angeles Dodgers were eliminated.
[02:29.520 --> 02:35.520]  Yeah, it's like the cherry on his shit Sunday, basically.
[02:35.520 --> 02:37.240]  Yeah, and it was close.
[02:37.240 --> 02:38.600]  It was three to two.
[02:38.600 --> 02:39.240]  Heartbreaker.
[02:39.240 --> 02:40.000]  So you know what?
[02:40.000 --> 02:42.720]  You're turning me around on baseball a little bit.
[02:42.720 --> 02:44.120]  Boy, the playoffs, playoff baseball
[02:44.120 --> 02:44.920]  is a different sport.
[02:44.920 --> 02:48.200]  Yeah, playoff anything is great, but yeah.
[02:48.200 --> 02:50.600]  I could see how a lot of people, someone who doesn't really get
[02:50.600 --> 02:51.600]  it, could get it.
[02:51.600 --> 02:53.880]  Same thing to me with the soccer.
[02:53.880 --> 02:56.120]  I'm not going to really watch regular season soccer,
[02:56.120 --> 02:58.080]  but I'm into the World Cup now.
[02:58.080 --> 02:59.840]  Yeah, good.
[02:59.840 --> 03:03.360]  The Euro, too, is probably going to be exciting.
[03:03.360 --> 03:06.480]  Euro is weird, because you're going to have to pick something at random.
[03:06.480 --> 03:10.240]  You're never going to have a home team in the Euro.
[03:10.240 --> 03:11.400]  But you know what?
[03:11.400 --> 03:13.960]  Your conversation with Ben last week was great.
[03:13.960 --> 03:15.600]  I loved it.
[03:15.600 --> 03:20.280]  What I like about soccer is that, and it's
[03:20.280 --> 03:23.400]  kind of what you guys discussed, is that eventually the score line
[03:23.400 --> 03:24.040]  doesn't matter.
[03:24.040 --> 03:27.480]  It's the stories that get told after the game.
[03:27.480 --> 03:30.920]  And you cover that a lot with Derek Jeter, where
[03:30.920 --> 03:35.600]  you could both recount crazy moves that he did.
[03:35.600 --> 03:41.320]  And not once did you ever really mention the score line.
[03:41.320 --> 03:44.880]  Right, and if you look at that sort of spreadsheet like,
[03:44.880 --> 03:47.920]  here's the game reduced to numbers, it just doesn't show up.
[03:47.920 --> 03:49.080]  It doesn't pop off the page.
[03:49.080 --> 03:51.560]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[03:51.560 --> 03:54.920]  When I'm dismissive of a stat, I call it a baseball stat.
[03:54.920 --> 03:59.080]  Only because, without context, so much stuff is just completely pointless.
[03:59.080 --> 04:01.320]  There's really no reason to it.
[04:01.320 --> 04:06.360]  I was adverse to baseball for many years, probably still am.
[04:06.360 --> 04:09.000]  Because it seems to fetishize stats, in a way,
[04:09.000 --> 04:12.880]  because nothing else is going on sometimes.
[04:12.880 --> 04:14.440]  Yeah, it lends itself to it, too.
[04:14.440 --> 04:15.800]  It's the pace of the game, too.
[04:15.800 --> 04:23.240]  And it's a game that lends itself to the keeping of innumerable statistics.
[04:23.240 --> 04:26.600]  And there's ways to show that all sorts of those statistics
[04:26.600 --> 04:30.200]  correlate, at least in some way, to winning and losing.
[04:30.200 --> 04:33.720]  And so it just lends itself to just elaborate,
[04:33.720 --> 04:36.840]  elaborate statistical analysis.
[04:36.840 --> 04:38.400]  I know, and that turned me off, though.
[04:38.400 --> 04:43.720]  Because when you start telling stories about Derek Jeter or whoever,
[04:43.720 --> 04:44.600]  I'm all into that.
[04:44.600 --> 04:45.680]  I love that kind of stuff.
[04:45.680 --> 04:50.640]  That's kind of why I like soccer.
[04:50.640 --> 04:51.920]  I don't want to say heroism.
[04:51.920 --> 04:56.920]  But it's the ups and downs of individual players and teams
[04:56.920 --> 05:01.520]  and that kind of thing that captures my attention.
[05:01.520 --> 05:04.960]  Yeah, the bottom line for me, and I know every week there's always
[05:04.960 --> 05:07.200]  somebody out there saying, I don't care about any sports at all.
[05:07.200 --> 05:09.040]  But the bottom line for me, and it's the appeal.
[05:09.040 --> 05:13.280]  And it fits right in with, take a guy like Jason Snow, who's
[05:13.280 --> 05:14.080]  a big baseball fan.
[05:14.080 --> 05:16.960]  He likes football, too, US football.
[05:16.960 --> 05:19.840]  But obviously, with all the incomparable stuff he does,
[05:19.840 --> 05:25.840]  he consumes an enormous amount of fiction, narrative fiction.
[05:25.840 --> 05:31.200]  To me, a lot of sports fans, or at least in my friend Matt's parlance,
[05:31.200 --> 05:33.360]  stats versus story guys, the story guys like me,
[05:33.360 --> 05:37.760]  we watch sports for the same reason we like to watch things like movies,
[05:37.760 --> 05:40.160]  is there's drama.
[05:40.160 --> 05:41.760]  But it's the weird thing with sports.
[05:41.760 --> 05:44.400]  With a movie, ostensibly, there's always going to be drama.
[05:44.400 --> 05:47.920]  And there's always going to be a good ending and a good story.
[05:47.920 --> 05:51.840]  Sometimes a sports game is just boring, because one team jumps out 8-0
[05:51.840 --> 05:53.120]  and it stays 8-0.
[05:53.120 --> 05:54.960]  And it's kind of, well, that was kind of dull.
[05:55.680 --> 05:56.800]  So you can't fake it.
[05:56.800 --> 06:00.160]  And then all of a sudden, sometimes it's 3-2 in the ninth inning,
[06:00.160 --> 06:02.000]  and the bases are loaded, and nobody's out.
[06:02.800 --> 06:04.160]  And you've got a real story.
[06:04.160 --> 06:08.480]  And there's no one person, like an author or a director,
[06:08.480 --> 06:12.080]  who gets to decide how it turns out based on what they think.
[06:12.080 --> 06:12.400]  You know?
[06:12.400 --> 06:13.200]  And it's that difference.
[06:13.200 --> 06:14.000]  It's that realness.
[06:14.000 --> 06:18.160]  It's that sometimes it's going to end.
[06:18.160 --> 06:21.040]  The good guys, meaning the team I'm rooting for,
[06:21.040 --> 06:23.600]  the good guys are going to lose.
[06:23.600 --> 06:24.880]  They're not always going to win.
[06:24.880 --> 06:27.360]  You know, I'm like this Dodgers manager.
[06:28.080 --> 06:28.400]  Right.
[06:28.400 --> 06:29.200]  Like a good man.
[06:29.200 --> 06:29.440]  Yeah.
[06:30.160 --> 06:30.560]  Great guy.
[06:30.560 --> 06:31.440]  Best nickname ever.
[06:31.440 --> 06:35.360]  His nickname, literally, I swear to God, his nickname is Donnie Baseball.
[06:35.360 --> 06:35.920]  Oh, God.
[06:35.920 --> 06:38.560]  Okay, this guy's aces.
[06:38.560 --> 06:39.200]  I like this guy.
[06:39.760 --> 06:40.000]  Right.
[06:40.000 --> 06:40.800]  How does he really...
[06:40.800 --> 06:41.600]  Donnie Baseball?
[06:41.600 --> 06:42.960]  How does he get like...
[06:42.960 --> 06:43.600]  That's crazy.
[06:43.600 --> 06:44.640]  How did he get that nickname?
[06:46.160 --> 06:48.560]  Just because he's like the baseball player's baseball player.
[06:48.560 --> 06:48.880]  Really?
[06:48.880 --> 06:50.080]  He's that kind of...
[06:50.080 --> 06:50.400]  Okay.
[06:50.960 --> 06:51.440]  Did you ever see it?
[06:51.440 --> 06:52.320]  Yeah, I swear to God.
[06:52.320 --> 06:54.000]  I twittered it the other day.
[06:54.000 --> 06:55.200]  He's the guy who...
[06:55.200 --> 06:59.200]  There's a YouTube clip of it, like in a regular season game in 1985.
[06:59.200 --> 07:02.560]  There was a foul ball, a big high pop-up going over into the stands,
[07:02.560 --> 07:04.400]  and he ran over to see if he could catch it.
[07:04.400 --> 07:06.480]  And it went too far into the stands. He couldn't catch it.
[07:07.280 --> 07:09.760]  Meanwhile, there's a kid in the front row eating a box of popcorn,
[07:09.760 --> 07:13.360]  and the kid had turned around to look where the foul ball landed,
[07:13.360 --> 07:16.560]  and Mattingly just reaches over and takes a handful of popcorn out of the kid's box.
[07:16.560 --> 07:18.240]  I saw that. That is him.
[07:18.240 --> 07:18.880]  And then he just...
[07:18.880 --> 07:20.560]  The kid turns around and is like,
[07:20.560 --> 07:22.800]  whoa, Don Mattingly just stole my popcorn.
[07:23.520 --> 07:26.480]  And then Mattingly just gives him a little nod, like, thanks for the popcorn, kid.
[07:26.480 --> 07:27.040]  That's awesome.
[07:27.040 --> 07:29.040]  And he goes back to first base to finish the game.
[07:29.040 --> 07:29.760]  That's awesome.
[07:31.760 --> 07:32.400]  Right?
[07:32.400 --> 07:34.000]  That's why he's Donnie Baseball.
[07:34.000 --> 07:34.480]  Yeah.
[07:34.480 --> 07:35.200]  Good nickname.
[07:35.200 --> 07:38.720]  While playing at the highest level, he's also thinking, well, I could go for some popcorn.
[07:39.760 --> 07:40.880]  That's perfect.
[07:40.880 --> 07:41.840]  See? Stories.
[07:42.480 --> 07:42.960]  Yeah.
[07:42.960 --> 07:43.440]  Right.
[07:43.440 --> 07:46.240]  Yeah. See, that's way better than what was batting average.
[07:46.240 --> 07:48.560]  Yeah. Who cares? Whatever. It doesn't matter.
[07:48.560 --> 07:50.080]  Right. But he took the popcorn.
[07:52.080 --> 07:54.160]  That makes him cool to me. I don't care.
[07:54.160 --> 07:55.600]  He's on my fantasy team.
[07:56.640 --> 07:57.200]  Exactly.
[07:57.200 --> 07:57.920]  He's immediately there.
[08:01.280 --> 08:03.040]  You want to talk non-sports?
[08:03.040 --> 08:06.480]  If anybody's listening, stop, first of all.
[08:06.480 --> 08:10.560]  Second, I'm not a sports guy, but I do enjoy stories.
[08:10.560 --> 08:11.060]  Right.
[08:11.600 --> 08:17.040]  Yeah. To me, that's just it, though. It's a way of hopefully manufacturing some actual
[08:17.040 --> 08:25.440]  drama that's going to come to a conclusion fair and square, based on the athletic abilities
[08:25.440 --> 08:26.560]  of the people involved.
[08:26.560 --> 08:30.880]  Well, not even fair and square if you got a dirty ref, which is like soccer half the
[08:30.880 --> 08:33.760]  time, and that's kind of part of the story.
[08:33.760 --> 08:36.240]  But even then, it adds to the story.
[08:36.240 --> 08:37.600]  Yes, I totally agree.
[08:38.240 --> 08:42.480]  And the other thing, too, about that, to me, it makes sports appealing, is that it's the
[08:42.480 --> 08:46.800]  fact, it's the complaint that a lot of people have about sports is that, well, it's pointless.
[08:46.800 --> 08:50.800]  Well, that's sort of what makes it. It makes it exciting because you can get all invested
[08:50.800 --> 08:57.200]  in it, and the team you're rooting for and more invested in win, lose. And it hurts,
[08:57.200 --> 09:02.160]  and you're upset, and you feel terrible for a day. But ultimately, it's okay because
[09:02.160 --> 09:02.880]  it was just a game.
[09:02.880 --> 09:07.680]  There's nothing. Yeah. You've only invested what you've emotionally put on the table,
[09:07.680 --> 09:10.640]  right? This is not going to change anybody's life.
[09:11.200 --> 09:12.160]  Right. Whereas...
[09:12.160 --> 09:15.360]  Unless you actually bet heavy, which don't do that. That's bad.
[09:15.360 --> 09:20.960]  Right. But whereas concentrating and obsessing over something that is even more dramatic,
[09:20.960 --> 09:27.120]  but where the stakes are real, like the situation in the Middle East between Israel
[09:27.120 --> 09:34.720]  and Palestine, or with this ISIS outfit, anything like that. There's all sorts of incredibly
[09:34.720 --> 09:40.560]  exciting drama involved, great stories to be told. But the stakes are so real, and it's
[09:40.560 --> 09:45.520]  real stuff. You can't take it lightly. You can't... When there's a big turn of events,
[09:45.520 --> 09:47.520]  you can't go, well, that was something, but too bad...
[09:48.080 --> 09:54.480]  Yeah, no, I totally agree. I think with sports, win or lose, in a way, you can always laugh
[09:54.480 --> 10:00.320]  at yourself. I can't believe I was so happy that this random team did this random thing,
[10:00.320 --> 10:07.040]  or I can't believe that I was so bummed out that they lost. With real life stuff, like
[10:07.040 --> 10:12.320]  what you're talking about, you don't get to laugh at yourself because it's people's lives
[10:12.320 --> 10:13.600]  on the line. It's a real thing.
[10:14.560 --> 10:19.040]  Right. We can be happy that the Death Star got blown up because the 6 billion people
[10:19.040 --> 10:21.280]  on the planet Alderaan weren't real people.
[10:21.280 --> 10:22.400]  Exactly. Yeah.
[10:22.400 --> 10:26.800]  There wasn't actually a real Holocaust that happened. It was just something that was in
[10:26.800 --> 10:27.760]  a space movie.
[10:27.760 --> 10:32.160]  Yeah. If you actually think about how horrible that movie is, there's a lot of dead people
[10:32.160 --> 10:36.800]  in there. It could be like the number one dead people movie.
[10:37.360 --> 10:41.120]  Right. There might've been more people killed in that movie than in any other movie ever
[10:41.120 --> 10:46.160]  filmed. I think that's an interesting argument. I would almost certainly think that that's
[10:46.160 --> 10:46.480]  the case.
[10:46.480 --> 10:48.160]  It's got to be close, right? I mean...
[10:48.160 --> 10:52.720]  Right. If you assume... We didn't learn much about Alderaan, but let's assume it was roughly
[10:52.720 --> 10:53.200]  Earth-like.
[10:54.320 --> 10:55.920]  5 to 6 billion people on there.
[10:56.480 --> 10:57.200]  Right.
[10:57.200 --> 11:01.120]  Plus all of the people dead on the Death Star, which has been gone into.
[11:01.760 --> 11:02.240]  Yeah.
[11:02.240 --> 11:04.080]  Plus the innumerable rebels killed.
[11:04.880 --> 11:05.380]  Right.
[11:06.320 --> 11:09.360]  It makes Darth Vader seem like a teddy bear.
[11:10.080 --> 11:11.600]  Because he only killed one person at a time.
[11:11.600 --> 11:14.080]  Yeah, he's not that bad.
[11:14.080 --> 11:16.800]  Yeah, he didn't have anything to do with firing the Death Star. That was all Tarkin.
[11:16.800 --> 11:18.560]  Exactly. God, I hate that guy.
[11:22.720 --> 11:24.800]  Want to talk what people want to hear about?
[11:24.800 --> 11:28.480]  Yeah. You know what, though? It's a good time before we get started on what people really
[11:28.480 --> 11:34.400]  want to hear about. Let's knock out the first sponsor. And let me tell everybody about our
[11:34.400 --> 11:40.320]  good friends returning as a sponsor of the show, our good friends at Harry's. Harry's
[11:40.320 --> 11:48.240]  makes high quality men's shaving stuff and makes it available at a terrific price.
[11:50.480 --> 11:55.440]  I've told you this before, but it's a great story. Harry's was started by a guy who went
[11:55.440 --> 11:58.640]  in, who was out of town traveling, went into a drug store because he realized he didn't
[11:58.640 --> 12:04.160]  pack his shaving stuff. Went in and all the shaving stuff in the drug store is all locked
[12:04.160 --> 12:07.840]  up behind a case. You have to get a clerk. You have to let him open it. And then you
[12:07.840 --> 12:13.200]  find out it's like 40 bucks for a pack of razor blades. So he thought, hey, there's
[12:13.200 --> 12:16.560]  got to be a better way. This stuff is only like two or three big companies, Gillette
[12:16.560 --> 12:20.480]  and Schick and whoever else who control this stuff. These prices have got to be artificially
[12:20.480 --> 12:32.080]  high. Ends up they are. And so Harry's focus is just a pure old fashioned disruption. You
[12:32.080 --> 12:38.880]  go, you sign up at Harry's, you get a kit, you get a reusable razor, and then you get
[12:38.880 --> 12:42.720]  a couple of blades to start with. And then going forward, you just get new blades sent
[12:42.720 --> 12:48.880]  to you. Really good price. Half the price of the competitors like Gillette. Marco did
[12:48.880 --> 12:54.080]  the research. I would just steal his research from an ATP where they sponsored. But Marco
[12:54.080 --> 13:01.200]  went to Amazon and priced a pack of Gillette fusion blades. It was like 40 some bucks.
[13:01.200 --> 13:06.160]  That's Amazon. We know Amazon cuts the prices about as low as they're going to go retail.
[13:06.160 --> 13:11.280]  Same equivalent pack of blades from Harry's was 20 bucks. Really. So when they say half
[13:11.280 --> 13:16.000]  the price, it's not like about half the price. Literally half the price. Ship them right
[13:16.000 --> 13:23.760]  to you. Really, really cool product design. Just nice feel to the stuff. Really nice heft.
[13:23.760 --> 13:27.440]  Really like I love the thing. It just feels like something that's going to last forever.
[13:27.440 --> 13:33.280]  A nice branding. Everything's nice. Nice packaging. Everything opens up nice. There's no blister
[13:33.280 --> 13:38.320]  packs or any crap like that. It's just a nice little cardboard package you open up. Just
[13:38.320 --> 13:42.720]  couldn't be better. If you're using anything else, you're probably paying too much and
[13:42.720 --> 13:46.880]  you're probably not getting as good as stuff. And the other thing, I always love this too
[13:46.880 --> 13:51.200]  because it just shows how serious these guys are, is that they're not just like white labeling
[13:51.200 --> 13:55.760]  some kind of razor blades they get from some generic contractor. Like they went to Germany
[13:55.760 --> 14:01.520]  and bought a razor blade factory and they make their own German engineered razor blades.
[14:02.720 --> 14:08.160]  They're not just buying Chinese razors and putting Harry's name on it. They're making
[14:08.160 --> 14:13.120]  their own in Germany. I love it. Super convenient. Just like anything else that once you get used
[14:13.120 --> 14:16.640]  to ordering it online, instead of having to go to the store and buy it every couple of weeks
[14:16.640 --> 14:21.840]  or months, you just never go back. Really good stuff. High quality, great price. So here's what
[14:21.840 --> 14:26.640]  you do and you'll get five bucks off your first purchase if you do what I tell you to do, which
[14:26.640 --> 14:38.960]  is go to harrys.com, H-A-R-R-Y-S.com and use the promo code talk show, just T-A-L-K-S-H-O-W
[14:38.960 --> 14:43.760]  and you'll save five bucks off your first purchase and their regular prices are already really low.
[14:43.760 --> 14:52.400]  So go do that. My thanks to Harry's. Uh, full disclosure, Harry's also sponsors my show, but
[14:52.400 --> 14:58.480]  you know what? Pretty awesome. I'm really happy. Have you, in the past two days, I got some samples
[14:58.480 --> 15:04.240]  of new shaving cream in an aftershave. I didn't get anything. They don't send me. They don't like
[15:04.240 --> 15:10.880]  you. No, but they love me. And I'm telling you, it's, it's takes all this. I think probably just
[15:10.880 --> 15:16.480]  swipes everything. Um, no, you know, I heard that. I heard that they, they got a new cream. They have
[15:16.480 --> 15:20.560]  a, like a lathering cream instead of a, like the first cream that they have, which is the one I use
[15:20.560 --> 15:25.440]  is, uh, it doesn't really work up a lather. It's just like, it's just a cream. It works great,
[15:25.440 --> 15:29.840]  but it doesn't like foam up. So the new one that some people just, yeah, some people just like it
[15:29.840 --> 15:33.760]  to foam up and now they have one. And today, just today, I haven't tried it yet, but the bottle
[15:33.760 --> 15:42.000]  looks awesome. Uh, I have like an aftershave sort of thing to try tomorrow, but it's great. I love
[15:42.000 --> 15:48.800]  it. And you know what, uh, besides the product, the packaging is incredible. Just the way the
[15:48.800 --> 15:55.120]  delivery, the design, everything about it is just amazing. Like I would buy it. I don't even care
[15:55.120 --> 15:57.920]  what's in the bottle. I feel bad. It's one of those things. It's like Apple products where I
[15:57.920 --> 16:02.160]  feel bad throwing the box out. Yeah. I keep my boxes until I get made fun of, to the point
[16:02.160 --> 16:06.080]  that it's like, no, I've really got to get rid of this thing. I still have my Mac pro box. It's just
[16:06.080 --> 16:13.920]  sitting there. No good reason. Anyway. Um, so I don't know what, 20 minutes in you want to,
[16:15.120 --> 16:20.560]  you want to get the show going? Yeah. Here's my big, the big topic, I think, and I don't know
[16:20.560 --> 16:26.960]  where it'll lead us when we get into the details, but it's this idea that we've, you, you and I have
[16:26.960 --> 16:30.720]  been involved in several of these threads this week on Twitter. A couple of people have too.
[16:30.720 --> 16:34.800]  And I think it's not, not that I'm hunting for people who agree with me, but I just,
[16:34.800 --> 16:38.800]  there doesn't really seem, I found it very curious that there was nobody arguing the other side,
[16:38.800 --> 16:45.120]  which is more or less a thesis that, well, there are two ways to pose it. At least this year with
[16:45.120 --> 16:51.680]  iOS eight and Yosemite, Apple bit off more than it could chew in terms of that, how much it was
[16:51.680 --> 16:58.240]  going to do and ship. And it's the quality control is suffering therefore that they,
[16:58.240 --> 17:03.680]  that they, they tried to do too much by September when they had to ship iOS eight because the new
[17:03.680 --> 17:10.560]  iPhones needed iOS eight. Um, and that this annual schedule there, not that the annual schedule is
[17:10.560 --> 17:17.200]  necessarily too, uh, too short a period, but that they're trying to do too much in those annual
[17:17.200 --> 17:20.720]  schedules. And if they want to do that much between major releases, it has to be more than
[17:20.720 --> 17:28.160]  a year. And if they want it to be a year, they have to do less at a time. Okay. So yeah, I've,
[17:28.160 --> 17:34.800]  I don't know. I, I was asked about this and I kind of disagreed with you, uh, and stated like that.
[17:34.800 --> 17:39.600]  I actually do agree with you because I think we probably think this similarly on a lot of
[17:39.600 --> 17:47.520]  these subjects. Um, you can't keep making the giant leaps that each of these OSs take
[17:47.520 --> 17:52.720]  in this space of a year. And the reason for that is that you don't have a year to do it.
[17:52.720 --> 17:56.640]  You've got maybe four to five, maybe six, if you're lucky months.
[17:57.440 --> 18:02.320]  Yeah. You, and you made this point on, uh, was it vector last week or debug?
[18:03.280 --> 18:04.480]  I don't know. I don't know.
[18:05.040 --> 18:08.000]  Well, whichever one, but yeah, explain, but explain. I thought this was,
[18:09.200 --> 18:13.520]  and I don't think that this, I don't think people think this because people think like,
[18:13.520 --> 18:17.520]  well, it's been a year since iOS seven came out. So why couldn't they do this in a year? But
[18:17.520 --> 18:21.040]  explain. Right. So, I mean, the reason is, and this is not just me, this is, you know,
[18:21.040 --> 18:27.120]  I've talked to project managers and people inside Apple. So I actually know that this is
[18:27.120 --> 18:32.240]  pretty much the fact, um, or the case, I don't want to say fact because I can't prove it. Um,
[18:34.720 --> 18:38.560]  the first few months are spent fixing the bugs that you did ship,
[18:38.560 --> 18:44.640]  right? That's the 8.01 and right. And even it just clearly a panic and we should get back to you.
[18:44.640 --> 18:49.200]  Right. If you forget, if you forget what it was like a year ago, when I was seven for a ship,
[18:49.200 --> 18:53.440]  don't worry about it. Just think about what, what you must assume people at Apple who work on iOS
[18:53.440 --> 18:57.440]  are doing right now today is they've got to be working on iOS eight bugs have to be,
[18:57.440 --> 19:01.440]  everybody knows it. All right. So they're doing that now. You ship it, call that,
[19:01.440 --> 19:08.160]  call that October, November, maybe even December. Yeah. So the iOS 8.0 0.1 bug hit
[19:08.160 --> 19:14.960]  40 to 50,000 people out of what I understand to be like a 10 million installed base.
[19:17.360 --> 19:21.280]  Despite that being a low percentage, that is a lot of people and it is,
[19:21.280 --> 19:26.960]  it's bad mojo. It's, it's bad news. Right? So yeah. And it's, it's enough like, and you know,
[19:26.960 --> 19:30.640]  it's, you know, I've clearly this small sample, this is the definition of this example size,
[19:30.640 --> 19:34.720]  but the day that that happened, that the 8.01 day, I think it was a Wednesday,
[19:34.720 --> 19:41.440]  um, whatever day of the week, it was mid day. And, uh, my pal Lee, the, the bartender,
[19:42.800 --> 19:49.760]  okay. Hey Lee. Uh, he, uh, he was guest bartending at a, uh, Jose Garcia's restaurant here in
[19:49.760 --> 19:57.280]  Philadelphia, uh, for happy hour and invited me and Amy to come. And so, um, got, got the
[19:57.280 --> 20:00.480]  kid taken care of and, you know, five went out and had a couple of cocktails with Lee
[20:00.480 --> 20:04.880]  at a new place. And he, he sat us next to a guy and the guy he sat us next to happened to be,
[20:04.880 --> 20:07.920]  he was like, are you John Gruber? And I was like, and I don't get that much in Philadelphia. And
[20:07.920 --> 20:14.240]  I was like, I am. And he ends up, he's a big fan. Uh, he, he's just an attorney. It works
[20:14.240 --> 20:20.080]  in Philadelphia. Also a fan of hops in laundromat bricked his iPhone six plus that day because he
[20:20.080 --> 20:24.880]  like came out. He had like, he had like court in the morning, had lunch, came out of lunch,
[20:24.880 --> 20:32.080]  saw that 8.01 was out, hit update. And by one o'clock his brand new iPhone six plus couldn't
[20:32.080 --> 20:37.040]  make phone calls. So, you know, I thought that was really interesting. I was like, wow, I just,
[20:37.040 --> 20:40.560]  you know, met somebody who got hit by the bug, you know? So I was like, it seems to me like it's
[20:40.560 --> 20:44.880]  pretty prevalent, 40 to 50,000 people. Again, it could have been a lot worse if it was everybody.
[20:44.880 --> 20:49.840]  Right. But I think the window was pretty small, right? It was, I don't know how many hours it
[20:49.840 --> 20:55.280]  was posted for. Well, but it was weird though, because I, it's one of those weird things about
[20:55.280 --> 21:00.400]  the way stuff propagates around the world with Apple and the CDNs that they use where they were
[21:00.400 --> 21:04.400]  still, I was still getting hearing from people on Twitter saying like four in the afternoon on
[21:04.400 --> 21:10.320]  Eastern time that their iPhone was still offering it and they knew not to allow it. But if they
[21:10.320 --> 21:14.080]  didn't, you know, hadn't been following the tech news of the day, they might've that it, you know,
[21:14.080 --> 21:18.800]  still hadn't been rescinded from at least their phone's perspective. Yeah. And you know, you have
[21:18.800 --> 21:25.440]  a pretty broad audience, but that is a tiny slice of Apple consumers, right? So, yeah. And I guess
[21:25.440 --> 21:29.600]  it kind of makes sense that, that that would be the max, you know, that something like that would
[21:29.600 --> 21:34.080]  be the number, because if it was a hundred percent of people, then it would have been caught. Yeah.
[21:34.080 --> 21:39.680]  It must, whatever the circumstances were that made that, that, that, that made this and I've still
[21:39.680 --> 21:44.240]  not seen anybody. Apparently it's a Delta update. Like if you just, it's the Delta download from a
[21:44.240 --> 21:50.400]  specific version to squeeze it up, apparently. Yeah. But it must've been something like that,
[21:50.400 --> 21:54.160]  because if it had affected everybody, it never would have made it out of QA. No. If it only
[21:54.160 --> 22:01.200]  affected, I don't know, 5% for some reason, you know, that the, you know, if you have this,
[22:01.200 --> 22:05.680]  if you have that, if you have this, then the, you know, it breaks your phone. Right. Just didn't,
[22:05.680 --> 22:11.120]  wasn't in their testing matrix, I guess. I think it was business insider that tried to name the,
[22:11.120 --> 22:15.120]  well, they did actually name the QA manager. No, business, it was business week. Oh, I'm sorry.
[22:16.160 --> 22:21.440]  I've got, that's, yeah, it's funny that I go to business insider, but, but yeah. Okay. So business
[22:21.440 --> 22:26.480]  week, don't do that. That's horrible reporting. You're missing the story and it's completely
[22:26.480 --> 22:31.120]  pointless. Yeah, that was a really, I thought that was so uncalled for. It's just dumb. It's,
[22:31.120 --> 22:37.360]  it's like when Jesus Diaz called out the guy that lost his iPhone 4 prototype. Right. And guess
[22:37.360 --> 22:44.400]  what? Hi Jesus, I'm going to call you out. Which is, again, a dick move. It was even worse. I
[22:44.400 --> 22:48.400]  would, I would say it was even worse. Really? Well, maybe not worse. No, no, it was an entire
[22:48.400 --> 22:53.440]  piece based on who this guy was. There was no reason for that. This poor kid, I'm calling him
[22:53.440 --> 22:59.440]  a kid, but whatever. He's, he was 20 some odd. Made a genuinely honest mistake. It was an honest
[22:59.440 --> 23:05.520]  mistake. People screw up. There was no need to rake him over the coals and, and out him. Like,
[23:05.520 --> 23:09.120]  you know, at least focus on the phone that you got. You really don't need to do a piece about
[23:09.120 --> 23:16.960]  the, you know, the guy that goofed and lost it. Yeah. I was going to say that it was worse though.
[23:16.960 --> 23:20.960]  And I know worse is the wrong word, but I would say, and the reason I was going to say that though
[23:20.960 --> 23:25.520]  is at least with the kid who lost the iPhone, he really did lose the iPhone. And what he was
[23:25.520 --> 23:32.000]  accused of having done is exactly what he did. That he had, as an engineer, he had access to
[23:32.000 --> 23:37.440]  access to pre-release iPhone. What was it? The iPhone four to use in the wild for field testing
[23:38.400 --> 23:45.520]  and left it at a bar restaurant. Well, we don't know, or it was lifted or it was lifted, but,
[23:45.520 --> 23:50.080]  but you know, but end of the day, it was not within when he left. Right. Right. Which is
[23:50.080 --> 23:53.520]  exactly what happened. Nobody's that's not in dispute. Whereas the first thing he did in the
[23:53.520 --> 23:59.600]  morning or it's like call in and be like, yo, I lost my iPhone. So right. Yeah. Right. He did
[23:59.600 --> 24:04.800]  the right thing, you know, but with the business week story, naming the guy and as being responsible
[24:04.800 --> 24:09.760]  for this eight Oh one update, and then further saying that he was on the QA team, that he was
[24:09.760 --> 24:17.440]  the leader of the QA team. Apple maps is actually wrong though. Like I, you know, I did the same
[24:17.440 --> 24:22.000]  thing as you, I asked around and it ends, you know, the guy is responsible for some level of
[24:22.000 --> 24:27.840]  QA at Apple, but nobody inside Apple that I talked to said that there's any sense that he like
[24:27.840 --> 24:33.840]  single-handedly pulled the trigger or deserves that anybody other than the entire company deserves
[24:33.840 --> 24:39.520]  team credit for the, for the fiasco. If you know, business week made it sound like one guy was like
[24:39.520 --> 24:48.080]  hitting a button and saying, it's ready to go. And his role, his role on maps was, had nothing
[24:48.080 --> 24:53.920]  to do with the maps data. It was the maps app, which nobody, which I know for users, they don't
[24:53.920 --> 24:58.240]  have a, it doesn't make a difference. They don't see a difference between the data and the app.
[24:59.600 --> 25:02.800]  But anybody who's listening to this show knows, knows the difference.
[25:02.800 --> 25:07.600]  Do you know what anybody reporting on technology for business week should know the difference,
[25:07.600 --> 25:14.720]  right? It's like being, you know, it's, it's bad. It's sort of like, it's sort of like the
[25:14.720 --> 25:19.840]  difference between your email client and what's in your emails. You know, it's like, it's not
[25:19.840 --> 25:26.160]  your email client's fault if the emails are full of junk. And the maps app worked fine. It was just
[25:26.160 --> 25:31.200]  that it had bad data and, you know, empty data that it was missing a lot of data, which he had
[25:31.200 --> 25:35.920]  nothing to do with. It was, that wasn't what he was QA. And yet there is listed in business week
[25:35.920 --> 25:41.680]  is like, you know, and the insinuation, it wasn't quite directed, but the only insinuation you could
[25:41.680 --> 25:46.400]  draw from it is that was the worst thing though, is that it was an insinuation and it wasn't like,
[25:46.400 --> 25:52.800]  wasn't like, um, putting all the wood behind the arrow. Like at least that would be a thing. This
[25:52.800 --> 25:58.080]  was just more like, this was like backhanded gossipy stuff. Yeah. And it's like the insinuation
[25:58.080 --> 26:04.800]  is Apple has an, you know, at least one inept bozo running, you know, doing QA who's, who's still,
[26:04.800 --> 26:09.760]  you know, after he, you know, made a terrible mistake with the maps is still bricking new
[26:09.760 --> 26:17.360]  iPhone, which is so far. It's just way off base. Somebody buy that guy a beer because he probably
[26:17.360 --> 26:22.800]  deserves it after this. I'll tell you, I don't think I've ever told this story publicly. I don't
[26:22.800 --> 26:27.840]  think, but I will. The writer, at least one of the writers on that story was Adam Satoriano.
[26:28.880 --> 26:37.120]  And, um, Adam Satoriano a couple of years ago wrote a piece for business week on me.
[26:37.120 --> 26:43.520]  Here's truly John Gruber, uh, which I went along with halfheartedly. I did talk to him,
[26:43.520 --> 26:47.920]  uh, I got thirsty bear when I was in San Francisco. Well, that's your first mistake.
[26:48.560 --> 26:53.200]  Uh, that was daytime. And then I met with a colleague of his here in Philly for followup
[26:53.200 --> 26:58.320]  questions. Um, and it was about what I do, the phenomenon of it was, well, it was posed to me
[26:58.320 --> 27:04.240]  initially as that they were going to write a piece about the independent Mac journalism web. People
[27:04.240 --> 27:10.640]  like me and Arnold Kim, who, who founded back rumors and maybe Jim Dalrymple and other people
[27:10.640 --> 27:16.480]  like that. Um, you know, people who are covering Apple, but, but as you know, either individuals
[27:16.480 --> 27:23.680]  like me or as, as new and, you know, publications like the loop and make rumors. Uh, and it became
[27:23.680 --> 27:28.640]  very obvious to me as the, the, the interviews progressed that it was not going to be that,
[27:28.640 --> 27:33.920]  that it was more just about me, which I found uncomfortable. And I encouraged them to not make
[27:33.920 --> 27:41.760]  it about me and make it about all of us together of which I'm just one example. Um, and so I kind
[27:41.760 --> 27:47.520]  of, and as it, as that became clear to me, I participated less and less and, you know,
[27:48.160 --> 27:54.000]  I don't think I wasn't rude and I didn't stop talking to them, but I stopped participating
[27:54.000 --> 28:03.120]  and they asked me to pose for a photograph and I refused. Um, that's awkward. Well,
[28:03.120 --> 28:07.520]  but I've seen the photographs that they had published of others and they made people look
[28:07.520 --> 28:14.160]  goofy. Like, uh, I told them this. So like, uh, what's the guy's name? Gene Munster. Yeah. Who's
[28:14.160 --> 28:21.600]  famously the analyst TV. Man. Yeah. I'm pulling for Gene, man. Love that guy. So I haven't looked
[28:21.600 --> 28:26.400]  at this well, but see if you, if you Google Gene Munster business, I don't know if I forget. I
[28:26.400 --> 28:30.560]  think it was business week, but it might've been Bloomberg, but Bloomberg owns business week.
[28:30.560 --> 28:34.640]  Mm hmm. Gene Munster says Apple is going to a thousand bucks.
[28:35.280 --> 28:39.200]  That might be it. No, no, that's from 2012. I don't want to make too much fun of him because
[28:39.920 --> 28:46.160]  this stock splits and sand. So it's just, it's very not fair. It's at 700 now. If you don't
[28:46.160 --> 28:49.760]  care, there it is. That's it though. But that's it. That's app, but that's it. Look at the picture
[28:49.760 --> 28:56.560]  of him. Why would you do this to somebody? Right. It's a very, to me, I think a very
[28:56.560 --> 29:01.360]  unflattering photo. I mean, I think he's goofy because of the TV stuff that he keeps bringing
[29:01.360 --> 29:06.960]  up, but this is that don't do that to him. He's smarter than that. Yeah. He's just, you know,
[29:06.960 --> 29:13.520]  they make him look like a clown. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, and, and I've seen other publications do this
[29:13.520 --> 29:19.200]  and I can also, I, and so I wanted nothing to do with it and you don't get to approve it. It's not
[29:19.200 --> 29:23.920]  like if they shoot 20 photos of me, I get to then pick which one they can use. They're all theirs.
[29:23.920 --> 29:28.960]  You agreed to let them do it. And I wanted nothing to do with that, nor would I allow them to use any
[29:28.960 --> 29:33.600]  of the photos I have of me. So they, I think if you look at the profile they had of me, if you
[29:33.600 --> 29:38.880]  Google it, they, they found like a, I don't know, a third party photo, like a creative comments thing
[29:38.880 --> 29:46.960]  from flipper or something. Um, uh, but anyway, the, the, the main point though is that there
[29:46.960 --> 29:50.960]  were then, then at the, towards the end they came out and asked the question I knew that they were
[29:50.960 --> 29:57.840]  going to ask, which is how much money do you make? And I said to Adam Satoriano on the record,
[29:57.840 --> 30:06.000]  I said, I don't know, I don't keep track. And he paused and he said, really? And I said, really,
[30:06.000 --> 30:11.440]  I don't keep track. And I said, off the record. And he said, what? And I said that, what you do,
[30:11.440 --> 30:15.680]  what I just told you is what you can quote me on. You can quote the world in business week. I don't
[30:15.680 --> 30:22.960]  know. I don't keep track. Um, and other than that, I'm not going to talk about it. Uh, and he, you
[30:22.960 --> 30:26.480]  know, he was like, so I could run that. I said, sure. I would love it if you ran that. I still
[30:26.480 --> 30:31.760]  wish he had right. But instead, uh, when the thing came out, it said like Gruber wouldn't discuss it.
[30:32.480 --> 30:40.960]  Um, but somebody familiar with his finances who can't be withheld, I swear to God, uh, because
[30:40.960 --> 30:46.160]  he doesn't have permission pegged his income at, I don't know what it was, $400,000. Well,
[30:46.160 --> 30:50.160]  you have a big organization, so I mean, God knows who leaked that. Right. Well,
[30:50.160 --> 30:54.640]  here's the thing that made me so mad about that. And I called Adam on it privately. I didn't,
[30:54.640 --> 30:59.440]  not publicly because I didn't want to bring it up because until now, well, I feel like on the talk
[30:59.440 --> 31:04.160]  show, maybe I can do it and it won't be in print, but I said, I know that it's bullshit. I know that
[31:04.160 --> 31:09.920]  it's bullshit because there's literally only three people on the planet who have any familiarity with
[31:09.920 --> 31:16.480]  my finances at all. That's me, my wife and my accountant. And I guess maybe if there's a fourth,
[31:16.480 --> 31:22.960]  it would be somebody at the IRS who, who handles the tax return that my accountant submits. But
[31:22.960 --> 31:26.240]  even then I doubt that there's anybody who remembers my name. I presume that those things
[31:26.240 --> 31:31.360]  are completely automated. Yeah, it's just robots. So there's literally only three people on the
[31:31.360 --> 31:37.680]  planet. And I know for a fact that he didn't speak to, uh, so, so Amy didn't rat you out.
[31:37.680 --> 31:42.560]  She didn't know. And I go to a pay phone on the corner and like privately, like, right.
[31:43.120 --> 31:47.760]  So what I presume that, I don't think he made it up. I presume that what he did is he found one
[31:48.320 --> 31:53.520]  person who's sponsored my site and asked, you know, what did you pay for the sponsorship and
[31:54.080 --> 31:57.600]  multiplied it or something like that? I don't know, but there's no way that, that, that would
[31:57.600 --> 32:02.560]  qualify. I mean, you, you present rates on your website, right? Right. But the description
[32:02.560 --> 32:07.840]  multiplied, but that's not what he said though. He did the description he used in print in business
[32:07.840 --> 32:12.480]  week is absolutely incompatible with any way that he could have come up with the number. Yeah. I
[32:12.480 --> 32:17.200]  thought that was so telling about, well, you know what it's like, Hey kid, get me a coffee,
[32:17.200 --> 32:22.240]  go to this website, find me this number, multiply it by 12. Right. It doesn't, it's just dumb.
[32:22.240 --> 32:26.400]  It's just anyway. Right. But I feel like it's dishonest. I feel like if that's what he did,
[32:26.400 --> 32:30.640]  then he should have said in print, you know, he should have spelled that out just like you
[32:30.640 --> 32:36.240]  did in print and said, as a ballpark estimate, there you go. Yeah. No, but what he said was
[32:36.240 --> 32:41.280]  that somebody familiar with my finances who didn't have, which it's made me mad in two ways because
[32:41.280 --> 32:46.720]  the first way is that it's, I know it's not true, but the second way is that insinuates that there's
[32:46.720 --> 32:52.560]  somebody who's close to me who betrayed me, which is even more angering. Yeah. That,
[32:54.320 --> 32:59.120]  yeah. I hadn't even thought of it like that. Yeah. That was like my secondary reaction.
[32:59.120 --> 33:02.800]  And in fact, that actually bothered me even more. That's somebody that I would,
[33:02.800 --> 33:07.520]  I would share my finances with somebody and that they would blab off the record to Adam
[33:07.520 --> 33:14.640]  Satoriano with business week, which didn't happen. So it always, and I always file that in my head
[33:14.640 --> 33:19.040]  whenever I see, I've never, I've always been a little bit skeptical of any unnamed sources
[33:19.040 --> 33:25.360]  in any, anything I read online. But after that, I'm even more so when I see information attributed
[33:25.360 --> 33:31.760]  to people familiar with the matter. Yeah. You have to. Right. I, yeah, I agree with you. I've,
[33:31.760 --> 33:40.720]  I've rejected that intellectually, but this is like a visual rejection, you know, like
[33:40.720 --> 33:47.600]  just being your pal. I know that. No, that's nobody would do that. I don't understand.
[33:47.600 --> 33:54.400]  Yeah. I am not a fan of Adam Satoriano's work. So he outed this guy at QA and I think that was a,
[33:54.400 --> 34:02.320]  that was a hack job and whatever. Pointless. We got way off track cause I was telling you why
[34:04.080 --> 34:08.880]  putting out an OS every year is kind of a pain in the ass. Right. At least three months after the
[34:08.880 --> 34:13.520]  OS comes out, you're fixing bugs. Minimum, you know, and you know, during that time,
[34:13.520 --> 34:19.680]  hopefully the management is trying to discern which are the major features that are going to
[34:19.680 --> 34:26.480]  be able to make it into the next release. Um, and then you've got maybe, you know, between,
[34:26.480 --> 34:31.760]  if you're lucky, three to six months to implement them, if you're lucky.
[34:32.800 --> 34:38.960]  And then or less squeeze, squeezing it in for WWDC. Yeah. Cause you know, I don't know what,
[34:38.960 --> 34:43.600]  you know, what's the December, January timeline for, you know, I had last year, what do you call
[34:43.600 --> 34:49.840]  it? Didn't 7.1 didn't come out until March. Yeah. But figure, I figured just as a rough timeline
[34:49.840 --> 34:56.480]  that through December it was mostly heads down on fixing stuff and doing stuff for 7.1 January
[34:56.480 --> 35:01.440]  and February. I'm sure a lot of resources started going towards the iOS eight, but some was still
[35:01.440 --> 35:08.000]  finishing the final touches on 7.1. Yeah. Um, but then roughly, you know, and up until June,
[35:08.000 --> 35:13.520]  you're trying to get the first working version of new stuff done for the next version of the OS.
[35:14.560 --> 35:24.400]  Right. I mean, um, yeah, so I'm hesitant to, uh, peg months to certain phases, right. Because,
[35:24.400 --> 35:31.040]  you know, I think that's fluid, but you know, the general process is that you'll get, if you're
[35:31.040 --> 35:37.040]  lucky, three to six months to actually implement stuff and the rest of the time, you know, at the
[35:37.040 --> 35:43.040]  end, you will be fixing everything that you find after you have released it as a beta, which is what
[35:43.040 --> 35:53.680]  WWDC is. Right. Uh, and so that means that any one given release has really only had, if you're
[35:53.680 --> 36:00.160]  lucky, three to six months of actual development time in terms of implementing new features,
[36:00.160 --> 36:04.960]  which is like creating, you know, create the creative phase of software development.
[36:04.960 --> 36:10.080]  That's the best way of putting it. Yes, I totally agree. Yeah. And so having this yearly schedule
[36:11.520 --> 36:19.840]  becomes onerous if you keep trying to bite off giant, you know, portions of the pie.
[36:22.560 --> 36:26.160]  If you know what you want to build, and I believe that Apple probably has like a road
[36:26.160 --> 36:31.280]  line that goes out, you know, a couple of versions at least, or at least they have aspirations.
[36:31.280 --> 36:37.360]  You're doing so only in chunks of three to six months of like pure creative engineering. The
[36:37.360 --> 36:42.800]  rest of the time is spent dealing with the bugs you created in the previous version and the bugs
[36:42.800 --> 36:52.080]  that you're fixing in order to get the current version out the door. And I, you know, I think
[36:52.080 --> 36:59.840]  ultimately what they want to get out the door may be running up against the door. And I think
[36:59.840 --> 37:06.240]  maybe running up against the limits of what they can achieve in that timeframe. Yeah, I totally
[37:06.240 --> 37:13.120]  agree with that. And I think they've compounded the problem. I mean, this all sounds very negative,
[37:13.120 --> 37:17.120]  but I mean, they've got Mac OS X, they've got iOS, and now they've got the watchOS.
[37:17.680 --> 37:26.080]  All of them increasingly have to work together. That stuff's going to take time. I think maybe
[37:26.080 --> 37:32.400]  I think there will be difficulties down the road trying to iron all of this stuff out.
[37:33.120 --> 37:38.400]  There's a lot of I don't know if bootstrapping is quite the right word, but it's, you know,
[37:38.400 --> 37:43.760]  almost like gear fitting, where, you know, with the way that these things are integrated with
[37:43.760 --> 37:48.160]  each other, which is great, and which is the way to go and which is better than the way that
[37:48.160 --> 37:55.200]  everything used to be a lot more siloed from Apple. But the fact that it's all geared together,
[37:55.200 --> 37:59.920]  creates these weird hiccups when one of the gears isn't ready yet. Right? Like, I mean,
[37:59.920 --> 38:07.280]  just one example, but I think it's a major one is the photo situation with iOS, totally, where,
[38:07.280 --> 38:11.360]  where are your photos? And where are they? How many are backed up and the ones that are, you know,
[38:11.360 --> 38:18.480]  to the iCloud and, and the fact I mean, they're not even trying it with even when Yosemite ships,
[38:18.480 --> 38:23.360]  the new Mac photo stuff, they've already said they said back at WWDC that that wasn't coming
[38:23.360 --> 38:29.920]  until 2015. Yeah, you know, in terms of having the Mac be a full client towards this new iCloud
[38:29.920 --> 38:39.040]  centric. Look, yeah. And I heard it suggested that they were doing it in Swift. And they it's not,
[38:39.040 --> 38:44.720]  it just takes that long to do that kind of app. Right. And that they know that because they have
[38:44.720 --> 38:50.320]  they do have some experience with. And it's always hard to estimate exactly, it's impossible to
[38:50.320 --> 38:53.920]  estimate exactly how long software is going to take to write. But they know how long it took to
[38:53.920 --> 38:58.000]  write iPhoto. And they know how long it took to write aperture. And they know how long a major
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.160]  update to aperture took and how long a major update to iPhoto took. And they knew that what
[39:02.160 --> 39:06.560]  they were undertaking with this is, you know, in that scope. And they know that, you know, that's,
[39:06.560 --> 39:15.200]  that's a nine, 10 months away thing. But it's such a big hole in the process. You know, in the
[39:15.200 --> 39:21.040]  overall experience right now, that nobody quite knows where their photos are, and how to make sure
[39:21.040 --> 39:26.880]  that they're everywhere. Yeah, I think they're lucky that they're ahead. Not lucky, they worked
[39:26.880 --> 39:33.680]  hard. They're ahead. This kind of weird little, you know, as you described it, the cogs not maybe
[39:33.680 --> 39:40.960]  meeting up exactly. And there's a little bit of grind. You know, I think that's expected. And I
[39:40.960 --> 39:46.400]  don't think it's necessarily cause for alarm. But I think institutionally, they're going to have to
[39:46.400 --> 39:54.080]  sort of adapt to this kind of interconnected stuff that they're committing to. And again, you
[39:54.080 --> 39:59.040]  mentioned this on your show last week. And I think it's another point I took a note that it's worth
[39:59.040 --> 40:03.760]  pointing out and just saying it like, hey, look, we're literally armchair quarterbacks here. We're
[40:03.760 --> 40:12.720]  just two guys, you know, we're just two guys, you know, observing from across the continent. And
[40:13.360 --> 40:19.520]  inside Apple, their leadership is running $100 billion a year Corporation. Yes, you know, and
[40:20.240 --> 40:25.680]  we're not, I'm not trying to tell them I know better. No, no, I'm just listening to me. Just
[40:25.680 --> 40:30.400]  keep doing good stuff. Don't like Yeah, but I'm just saying though, as an observer, if we want to
[40:30.400 --> 40:36.560]  just take a step back and look at the state that that the whole software ecosystem is across the
[40:36.560 --> 40:43.520]  Apple board right now. It's not good right now, in September, October 2014. Rough spot. Yeah.
[40:43.520 --> 40:50.320]  Yeah. And last year was very similar. Yeah, I thought Yeah, I mean, last year, last year, I
[40:50.320 --> 40:57.040]  think a lot of us chalk chalked it up to well, it was 70 to change for style being gone. Right. So
[40:57.040 --> 41:01.200]  that's going to reboot the process. And they didn't really have that much time. Right. And
[41:01.200 --> 41:06.000]  that those of us who know how long stuff takes, we're still and still to this day, I'm kind of in
[41:06.000 --> 41:11.840]  awe that they shipped iOS seven as even though as rough as it was in as short a time as they did.
[41:11.840 --> 41:16.880]  Yeah, that should not have happened. Right. Knowing that it really didn't start until after
[41:16.880 --> 41:22.880]  four stalls ouster, you know, late in late in the year 2012. Well, I think some of the technical
[41:22.880 --> 41:28.320]  underpinnings did but certainly the redesign was new. Yeah. And some of the noodlings of the design
[41:28.320 --> 41:34.560]  had started. Yeah. But But as a look, we're going to actually do this. And we actually need to take
[41:34.560 --> 41:41.200]  this style of design and apply it to everything top to bottom. Didn't start until the forestall
[41:41.200 --> 41:47.680]  ouster and re rejigging of the, you know, john putting johnny Ive in front of in charge of all
[41:47.680 --> 41:55.120]  all design software and hardware, including putting what's his name in charge of software
[41:55.120 --> 42:05.120]  engineering? Mr. The hair? Yeah. Craig Federighi. Yeah, Federighi in charge of, you know, the
[42:05.120 --> 42:11.440]  engineering. That's incredible timeframe. And so we I think we we we as like observers and critics
[42:11.440 --> 42:16.480]  of the company, we're willing to grant a little bit more grace last year with iOS seven bugginess
[42:16.480 --> 42:22.640]  until Iowa seven one. Whereas this year, it doesn't really seem it seems like an own goal,
[42:22.640 --> 42:28.640]  like a for an unforced error. Yeah, they didn't necessarily double double sports metaphor. Yeah,
[42:28.640 --> 42:33.040]  double sports matter. I'll go unforced error. I'll take our own goal. own goal is a little more is
[42:33.040 --> 42:36.800]  too drastic. It's Yeah, it's more like an unforced error that they didn't quite have to do as much
[42:36.800 --> 42:41.760]  of this as they needed to all at once. They didn't have to do third party keyboards right now.
[42:41.760 --> 42:49.680]  Right? Well, didn't they? I mean, I don't know. I don't personally No, I don't think so. I'm
[42:49.680 --> 42:53.200]  probably not going to use a lot of those keyboards. I just don't think they needed to
[42:53.200 --> 42:57.680]  do it yet. You know, I mean, I think in hindsight, you know, but again, but you know, wait, you know
[42:57.680 --> 43:04.880]  the press better than than I do. Do you think that would have been called out? I was still does not
[43:04.880 --> 43:11.280]  support swipe, which I think so. I do think I do think that there was, you know, there's this
[43:11.280 --> 43:17.120]  weird. I mean, the news cycle is always screwed up, right? Like the bending phones. And yeah,
[43:17.120 --> 43:22.320]  I do think that, you know, I firmly believe I've said this for years. And I think I think,
[43:22.320 --> 43:27.440]  you know, people say you can kind of tell like, just shiller alone is not he's not just there to
[43:27.440 --> 43:34.400]  to do ads. You know that? No, no, it's not. Like marketing, I think it's a bad rap. And there might
[43:34.400 --> 43:39.920]  be some companies that do it this way. But that, you know, somebody creates the product does in
[43:39.920 --> 43:43.760]  certain type, the company designs, whatever it is, and engineers make it and it becomes real.
[43:43.760 --> 43:46.880]  And then it's finished. And then they hand it to marketing. And they say, now sell it.
[43:47.920 --> 43:52.640]  That's not how marketing works at Apple. And it's not how it works at most companies. Marketing
[43:52.640 --> 43:57.680]  is just describing what the product is. And marketing is part of the design process of
[43:57.680 --> 44:03.040]  making sure that it fills a need and that it's going to sell before it's made, you know, it's
[44:03.040 --> 44:09.440]  yeah, I mean, I was just talking to Neaton Kanatra and Don Melton yesterday, because I'm
[44:09.440 --> 44:15.200]  going to name John. And I mean, they were both they're both been in meetings with with Phil.
[44:16.080 --> 44:20.800]  And no, it's very much part of the design process. Like this is not working the way I'd like it to
[44:20.800 --> 44:27.520]  work. Go make it work better. Like this is failing me in these kind of ways. It's it's right. It's
[44:27.520 --> 44:31.680]  part of the process like they're built in from the beginning. And then at the end of the process,
[44:31.680 --> 44:37.920]  when it is time to come up with actual slogans, and the billboards, and here's the way we're
[44:37.920 --> 44:43.040]  going to present it on stage at the intro event. You're just they're just describing what it
[44:43.040 --> 44:48.720]  actually is. Like, yeah, and I think that's very, very true of almost all Apple products is that
[44:48.720 --> 44:54.800]  the marketing really is pretty apt. It's well, you know, why I think because marketing has been
[44:55.520 --> 45:00.240]  and marketing is a horrible word. I wish I wish there was a better word for it. Because it's been
[45:00.240 --> 45:06.240]  stained too often. Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah, it's not inherently bad word. And now but from like
[45:06.240 --> 45:11.840]  a geek culture. It's like our marketing. It's like, lie to people. No, no, no, it's not always
[45:11.840 --> 45:17.920]  that. I had the same conversation this week on Twitter with Anil Dash and Gina Trapani at
[45:17.920 --> 45:21.760]  Think Up. They were the sponsors of Daring Fireball last week. And that their their Think
[45:21.760 --> 45:26.080]  Up thing they described as social network analytics. And on Twitter, or even in my write
[45:26.080 --> 45:30.880]  up on Daring Fireball, I said, look, analytics is a sullied word. Yeah, don't think of it that way.
[45:30.880 --> 45:35.200]  It's just useful information about you that you would want to know. And it's not like for
[45:35.200 --> 45:40.720]  douchebags. And Anil even said that it's like, internally, like, then he knows they couldn't
[45:40.720 --> 45:45.120]  say it, but that they he thought of a slogan, like, it's social analytics, but we swear it's
[45:45.120 --> 45:50.640]  not douchey. Because it's it. And again, there's nothing inherently wrong with the word analytics,
[45:50.640 --> 45:54.880]  technically, literally, by the definition, that is what Think Up does agree. And that is what,
[45:54.880 --> 45:59.920]  you know, marketing is, you know, it is what it says it is. But the word is just taken on a bad
[45:59.920 --> 46:06.240]  connotation. Oh, totally. Yeah, no, that's, that's great advice. Smart people, too. Sorry. And I
[46:06.240 --> 46:11.440]  totally understand that one of the marketing stamps for iOS eight this year, and well, not
[46:11.440 --> 46:17.760]  just iOS eight, it goes hand in hand with the fact that the iPhones six or bigger, is it's the shut
[46:17.760 --> 46:24.240]  up about Android year. Right, right. Like, like, like, or maybe that's a bad way to put it. But
[46:24.240 --> 46:32.080]  it's the here's the things that here's the the reasonable reasons that somebody might choose
[46:32.080 --> 46:39.440]  Android over iPhone here will will give you our answer on them. Right. So you like bigger phones,
[46:39.440 --> 46:44.720]  totally reasonable. Okay, now we have bigger phones. You like third party keyboards. Okay,
[46:44.720 --> 46:50.080]  now we have third party keyboards. You like sharing information directly between applications
[46:50.080 --> 46:55.120]  and you know, doing that, you know, and it is it's all the big highlight. Most of the
[46:55.120 --> 46:59.440]  big highlight features are the sort of things that Android had gotten to first.
[47:00.160 --> 47:06.000]  Yeah, okay. Even Windows Phone have, you know, taken a bite out of that stuff.
[47:06.560 --> 47:10.400]  Yeah, yeah, I think Windows Phone with the sharing between applications was,
[47:10.400 --> 47:15.600]  you know, I, I know Android had some stuff first, but I thought the way that Windows did it was
[47:15.600 --> 47:21.920]  was more of a worse. Oddly enough, it was closer to Apple. Yeah, it was a lot more like, yeah,
[47:21.920 --> 47:28.400]  Apple's well services in Mac OS X. Yeah, you know, it's just taken Apple, you know, all these
[47:29.040 --> 47:34.480]  literally decades to get back around to services from a you know, why? So forced,
[47:34.480 --> 47:39.360]  I'll stomped on the idea of services in iOS. iOS. Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah,
[47:39.360 --> 47:41.120]  you didn't know that because you haven't heard the show yet.
[47:41.120 --> 47:50.320]  Neaton was just talking about it yesterday. Ooh, ouch. Well, not ouch. It was because if
[47:50.320 --> 47:55.840]  every single app that exposed the service as OS X does, you just haven't looked at completely
[47:55.840 --> 48:00.960]  unwieldy services menu. Oh, yeah. Well, that's a great point. Oh, I see. I see services.
[48:02.400 --> 48:07.040]  Literally, because I mean, they have a pasteboard server in iOS, like it.
[48:07.040 --> 48:14.720]  Yeah. iOS works incredibly similarly to the way the Mac does. Yeah. If you know how to implement
[48:14.720 --> 48:20.160]  services, it's really pretty basic. It's like something goes on a pasteboard, not the, not the
[48:20.160 --> 48:27.360]  one that you copy and paste into, but a separate one. Another app can then is invoked and it pulls
[48:27.360 --> 48:31.600]  something off that pasteboard. It does something with it and it pastes it, copies it back up to
[48:31.600 --> 48:37.120]  the pasteboard. And then the app that you called it from just takes that from the pasteboard and
[48:37.120 --> 48:42.640]  puts it in the app. It is, if you can do copy and paste, you can do services. Yeah. And it's just a
[48:42.640 --> 48:48.320]  very basic little specification of here's the data type. Here's the standard data types for services.
[48:48.320 --> 48:53.440]  And here are the ones I'm interested in. It's dead simple. Me as a service, I might only be interested
[48:53.440 --> 48:58.320]  in text. So don't even bother with me if the selection is something else. It's dead simple.
[48:58.320 --> 49:06.720]  And the idea got, well, it, they didn't want to put it into iOS because the model, the interaction
[49:06.720 --> 49:10.480]  model would just eventually become cumbersome with so many applications. Well, and you can see it,
[49:10.480 --> 49:15.280]  you can see it on Mac OS X, if you have enough third-party apps and stuff. And nobody looks at
[49:15.280 --> 49:19.920]  that menu. I mean, you and I do, and maybe some portion of you listeners, but it's a power user
[49:19.920 --> 49:25.280]  feature. It definitely is. And it's always been and will always be into, unless they totally
[49:25.280 --> 49:29.680]  revolutionize it, like, like with extensions. Yeah. I mean, so my app implements a couple of
[49:29.680 --> 49:35.360]  services. I imagine if you, you know, when you ship Vesper for the Mac, I imagine you'll have a
[49:35.360 --> 49:43.280]  service. Right. I think you'd be surprised at how few people use it, but it kind of needs to be
[49:43.280 --> 49:47.360]  there just because the people who do use it will definitely want to put it in their work. Yes.
[49:47.360 --> 49:52.320]  Cause we appreciate these kinds of people. And you can go into, and it's so weird. It's like,
[49:52.320 --> 49:57.120]  you'd never think to look there. You have to go to system preferences on a Mac system preferences,
[49:57.120 --> 50:07.680]  keyboards, shortcuts, services, and there you get a list of all of the services from all the apps
[50:07.680 --> 50:12.880]  you have installed. And then you can turn off the ones you don't use. Yeah. And it's so like,
[50:12.880 --> 50:17.920]  who would ever think that you would go there to manage the system services to go keyboard
[50:17.920 --> 50:23.280]  shortcuts services. It's just such a weird hidden. And it is a giant list. It's kind of crazy.
[50:24.320 --> 50:28.240]  Yeah. And it's also a mess too, because the service can specify its own keyboard shortcut,
[50:28.240 --> 50:33.840]  but there's nothing that stops two services from conflicting shortcuts. And there's no good,
[50:36.240 --> 50:39.760]  no good way to resolve that. I don't even know what the rules are. It's like one of them somehow
[50:39.760 --> 50:43.440]  wins. I don't know if it's the first one to claim it or the last one to claim it, but one of them
[50:43.440 --> 50:48.560]  wins, but it's not, not because you, the user chose it. You can't order the first or last one.
[50:48.560 --> 50:53.600]  So it's right. I would imagine it's the last one that the system notices and registers,
[50:53.600 --> 51:00.800]  but completely arbitrary anyway. So long story short. Yeah. The idea of services got nixed in
[51:00.800 --> 51:07.360]  iOS. And I thought you meant when I, when I, when I toothed sucked before and said, ouch,
[51:07.360 --> 51:13.440]  ouch. I thought you meant the idea of like extensions for iOS. No, no, no, no. You're
[51:13.440 --> 51:17.760]  saying certain literally services, right? Yeah. Right. Yeah. Well, that makes sense. And that's
[51:17.760 --> 51:23.840]  forced all at his best. I think so too. And, and I, and I imagine this part will make the show.
[51:24.400 --> 51:29.360]  We're going to have to edit that. Cause I think I think some stuff got said that probably shouldn't
[51:29.360 --> 51:36.480]  have got said, uh, or at least publicly. Um, I think that that was forced all at his best
[51:36.480 --> 51:44.080]  because he's an old next guy and services were kind of a feather in the cap of the next system.
[51:44.720 --> 51:48.800]  And for him to be like, no, screw this. We really don't want to go down this rabbit hole.
[51:49.520 --> 51:53.040]  Yeah. And I think he was, I think he had his eyes open enough to see that it didn't play
[51:53.040 --> 51:58.080]  out well on Mac OS X. And I think part of the reason it didn't play out as well on Mac OS X
[51:58.080 --> 52:05.360]  as next is that next never really had a lot of developers. They had like some and the ones that
[52:05.360 --> 52:09.840]  they had, even the third party ones were amazing, right? The Omni group is still around the Omni
[52:09.840 --> 52:16.400]  group started, you know, they were the, you know, fantastic company. Um, but there weren't, you
[52:16.400 --> 52:20.240]  know, people with next computers were never complaining about how long their services menu
[52:20.240 --> 52:24.640]  was because all the apps were providing all these services that didn't have that many apps.
[52:24.640 --> 52:30.960]  That is exactly what he said. He's like, there was like five apps out there. Don't worry about it.
[52:30.960 --> 52:36.080]  It's not an issue. Try it on an iPhone. It's like, Oh my God, I'm going to be scrolling for
[52:36.080 --> 52:39.760]  like three weeks trying to figure out like where the services that they want.
[52:40.480 --> 52:45.520]  Right. Like I, when I upgraded to iOS eight, I took the time and like deleted all the apps
[52:45.520 --> 52:50.000]  that I hadn't used. And I figured if I haven't used it in a more than a month, just delete it.
[52:50.000 --> 52:53.040]  And if I really ever want it back, I can just go to the app store and get it back.
[52:53.040 --> 52:55.440]  I wish I had, I've got so many apps on.
[52:55.440 --> 52:59.760]  And I still have so many apps, you know, and there's some I was like, Oh, I haven't used it,
[52:59.760 --> 53:03.120]  but I still, I like that game. So maybe I'll keep it. But anyway, I still have so many apps.
[53:03.120 --> 53:05.200]  I can't even imagine how long my services menu would be.
[53:05.200 --> 53:08.160]  Yeah. Well, I mean, I imagine you just install apps to try them, right?
[53:08.720 --> 53:11.120]  Yeah. And I do the same thing.
[53:11.120 --> 53:12.720]  And it's a lot easier to just leave them around.
[53:13.360 --> 53:17.840]  Exactly. I just can't be bothered. I literally have Grindr on my app and I'm a straight male.
[53:17.840 --> 53:22.880]  So I don't know. I don't, it's like every now and then somebody notices. I'm like,
[53:23.520 --> 53:28.720]  I just, I, I needed to see what the UI was because people were talking about this app all the time.
[53:28.720 --> 53:30.720]  That's just, just in case.
[53:32.480 --> 53:35.280]  Kind of curious. Who knows? Maybe I'll get drunk. I don't know.
[53:37.040 --> 53:42.560]  I've got, I've got Tinder too, which I also never use. It's just awkward. There's I've got period
[53:42.560 --> 53:47.600]  trackers too. Like there's apps on my phone that I cannot explain to anybody except that like,
[53:48.320 --> 53:53.120]  somebody told me it was a good app to just see this kind of particular interaction with something.
[53:53.120 --> 53:54.400]  Okay. I'll buy it and try it out.
[53:54.400 --> 54:00.240]  Yeah. Whiskas and I do that a lot. Just if one of us spots an app that has an interesting
[54:00.240 --> 54:04.960]  interaction, we'll, we'll buy the app just to, just to see like a good,
[54:07.120 --> 54:11.280]  oh, you should see the way that you can reorder lists in this app. You don't have to hit edit
[54:11.280 --> 54:15.280]  first. You just do this. Some weird kind of thing. Yeah. Like what? Like a long press and
[54:15.280 --> 54:19.440]  that you reorder. Yeah. Yeah. And then, but like what the app actually does is something that's
[54:19.440 --> 54:24.480]  yeah. Who cares? What are those? Right. It's like, yeah. Might be managing your, you know, your glucose
[54:24.480 --> 54:30.480]  levels for diabetes. I don't have diabetes. Yeah. Something like that. Anyway, let's take a break.
[54:30.480 --> 54:39.360]  I'll thank our second sponsor. Grinder. No, no, no grinder. No grinder is awesome. I mean,
[54:39.360 --> 54:44.800]  you know, yeah, but it's not our sponsor. It is a back place. Our good friends at back place.
[54:44.800 --> 54:52.400]  I have a great story to tell. This is amazing. This is we are recording on Tuesday, October 7th.
[54:53.280 --> 55:01.680]  Last night, Monday, October 6th, my main Mac fan was on real loud at my desk. My wife was
[55:01.680 --> 55:06.160]  going to record her podcast and I thought, you know what? And I checked the uptime and it was
[55:06.160 --> 55:10.160]  like 14 days. I was like, oh, that's a long time to run at this thing. I'll just restart. So I
[55:10.160 --> 55:16.640]  restarted the Mac and to let it sit at that login screen and just shut up and let the fan go off.
[55:16.640 --> 55:21.280]  So when she record, she records at my desk cause that's where the microphone is. And then she
[55:21.280 --> 55:30.000]  recorded her podcast. Just the tip with the POC fastest good podcast. PK. I came back after
[55:30.000 --> 55:34.800]  watching a baseball game and I wanted to get my computer restarted and get it safari back on,
[55:34.800 --> 55:40.320]  ended up, wouldn't restart. I thought, Ooh. And I look and I like hit the power button, held the
[55:40.320 --> 55:45.040]  power button, shut down and held the power button again. And I heard a little something starting up
[55:45.040 --> 55:50.640]  and a light came on, but it never even got to the startup chime, which is a very bad sign.
[55:50.640 --> 55:54.640]  If this, if you don't hear that bong, when you start your Mac, you don't get past the post.
[55:55.440 --> 56:00.320]  That's a very, you could, you should bet money that you have a logic board problem.
[56:00.320 --> 56:07.280]  And I thought, and then I thought, you know what? I know I'm backed up. I know I'm backed up. So
[56:07.280 --> 56:11.280]  there's, you know, worst case scenario, all I've got to do is just wait and restore from backup.
[56:11.280 --> 56:16.400]  I haven't lost anything. I'm backed up in a couple of ways, but one of the ways I'm backed up and I
[56:16.400 --> 56:22.080]  know I'm backed up is through backplace, which is online backup that runs in the background.
[56:22.080 --> 56:25.680]  And it's actually the one that gives me the most peace of mind because it's the one that I don't
[56:25.680 --> 56:28.080]  have to do anything about. And it's the one that gives me the most peace of mind because it's the
[56:28.080 --> 56:32.240]  one that I don't have to do anything about. And I literally, this is what I did is I didn't try to
[56:32.240 --> 56:35.360]  resuscitate the Mac. It was late at night and I thought, I'll worry about this in the morning.
[56:35.360 --> 56:39.520]  I just went to a different machine, could have been my iPhone, could have been another Mac,
[56:39.520 --> 56:43.920]  doesn't matter. You just log into backplace. I logged into my backplace account and just looked
[56:43.920 --> 56:49.360]  and it said that I was backed up as of like 8 PM last night. And I was like, Oh, I'm all set.
[56:50.000 --> 56:55.360]  What is backplace backup? It backs up everything on your Mac, everything. If you have external hard
[56:55.360 --> 57:02.400]  drives, it backs those up too. What's the limit on space? It's unlimited. You just pay $5 a month
[57:02.400 --> 57:07.680]  and everything on your Mac gets backed up. What's the catch? There is no catch. If there's,
[57:07.680 --> 57:13.040]  if there's technically a catch, it's that the $5 a month, which is incredibly low is per Mac,
[57:13.760 --> 57:18.080]  but that per Mac cost is everything on the Mac, including the external drives.
[57:19.520 --> 57:22.640]  If I didn't have backplace, I have no idea. I either would have been up all night trying
[57:22.640 --> 57:27.120]  to restore resuscitate the drive, opening the case, trying to take the SSD out and put it in a
[57:29.120 --> 57:32.400]  another case and putting it in, stay up all night, doing stuff like that.
[57:33.520 --> 57:38.000]  All I did is just log in my backplace account. I knew I was backed up. Nothing to worry about.
[57:39.200 --> 57:45.520]  Can't say enough. What a great feeling that is. You just, here's what you do to sign up.
[57:45.520 --> 57:53.280]  Go to backblaze.com slash daring fireball, back blaze, b l a z e.com slash daring fireball.
[57:53.280 --> 57:59.520]  They know you come from the show that way. You get a 14 day free trial, no credit card up front.
[57:59.520 --> 58:06.720]  Just do that. Install their software on your Mac, set up an account, use the 14 days. It might take
[58:06.720 --> 58:12.240]  a while for all of your stuff to get up upstream through the cloud. Do that in the first 14 days.
[58:12.240 --> 58:17.600]  See how it works. See how it's just, once you have it set up, it just runs. You don't do anything.
[58:17.600 --> 58:20.960]  You don't have to remember once a day to hit the backplace button and do an upload.
[58:21.520 --> 58:26.320]  It just uploads as it sees that you need to incrementally. Can't say enough. I mean,
[58:27.120 --> 58:34.160]  here I am testimony to it. Broken Mac, nothing lost. Camp couldn't be easier. So my thanks to
[58:35.040 --> 58:38.560]  backplace. Go get them. Don't be a dummy. Who's not backed up.
[58:38.560 --> 58:44.320]  That's great. I mean, just honestly, we had to delay the show because your Mac was all bust up.
[58:44.320 --> 58:49.280]  Yeah. I'm glad it worked out. Yeah. I, the best thing about, I'm telling you,
[58:49.280 --> 58:51.280]  the best thing about it is you don't have to remember anything to do it.
[58:52.080 --> 58:57.360]  Yeah. I know. I don't trust myself either, which is a testament to backplace. I don't
[58:57.360 --> 59:02.080]  really like it. You know, I'm never going to, if I intentionally have to think about backing up,
[59:02.080 --> 59:06.080]  but I'm going to screw it up sometime. Yeah. It's not really backup. I think
[59:06.080 --> 59:09.920]  somebody argued with me once and I agree with it that if, if your backup system is something you
[59:09.920 --> 59:15.200]  have to invoke manually, that's not a backup system. It's smart. It's smart. You know,
[59:15.200 --> 59:21.120]  it's something you've got clones of your data. It's worth doing. I use super duper like that,
[59:21.120 --> 59:27.280]  the third part, you know, external drives, but it's, uh, it's not really backed up. Backed up
[59:27.280 --> 59:32.080]  is when something hits unexpectedly. And then I go and check and I'm backed up from the last moment.
[59:32.080 --> 59:36.960]  I remember sitting at my computer. That's a backup. Well, I think, you know, I think that's
[59:36.960 --> 59:42.400]  what time machine tries to address. And I think that that's what backplace does in spades. Right?
[59:42.400 --> 59:46.960]  Yeah. Yeah. Time machine's a great solution too. I'd say do them all do, you know, there's no way
[59:46.960 --> 59:53.040]  you could be more backed up. You can be too backed up. Well, you can be, but not in terms of your
[59:53.040 --> 59:57.360]  computer. Yeah. No time machines. One of the best things that Apple did. I still think that they
[59:57.360 --> 01:00:04.080]  need to, I would love to see Apple do something, improve the means of using time machine from
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:10.640]  a Mac book. Like I know they've got the time machine base station, but it's, I still feel
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.000]  like that could be, that could be a better experience. I mean, did you notice that they
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.600]  got rid of the, uh, maybe I can talk about this. Uh, I'm going to anyway. Uh, they got rid of the
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:29.120]  star back field background. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good call. Way better. Yeah. Yeah. My understanding is
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:37.760]  the star field was literally a joke. It was like somebody, it was, it was my understanding is that
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:43.760]  it was matters basically making a joke and run with that. It was definitely madness. I heard
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:49.680]  this. Yeah. I don't want to peg it to some. Yeah. But that's hilarious. It's like, here's the goofiest
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:56.640]  thing I can imagine. Yeah. Let's make that right. That it's like an interesting way of, of starting
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.520]  like, well, what's the most outlandish way? Like what's the most, what's the most buttoned up way
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:07.200]  that we could do it. Well, here's Dr. Who. Right. Well, you could do like both extremes. You could
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:11.200]  say what's this most straight laced conservative buttoned up way we could do it and say, well,
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.120]  it would look like the finder, except just maybe it's just list view, you know, just look just
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:19.520]  like the finder, but maybe that's a different color. Uh, okay. All right. What's the most
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:25.280]  outlandish way we can do it. Yeah. Yeah. And you're like, it's like the credit scene of Dr.
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:36.480]  Who, like the opening, right? And we'll do it. We'll do it in three D. And then they were like,
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:41.200]  let's, let's go ahead and do it. We were talking about forestall before and somebody emailed me.
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:45.920]  And again, you can't, you know, it's small data samples because it's only been two major releases
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:53.200]  since forestall left. Um, but somebody emailed me, uh, I didn't recognize the name. It's not,
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:57.360]  it's not like somebody who, you know, it was, but it was clearly somebody who had some, you know,
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:01.440]  who used to work at apple, you know, some engineer and just said, Hey, you know, but doesn't work
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:06.640]  there anymore. And just more or less said, you know, this could be, you know, the downside of
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:12.080]  losing Scott forestall, because wherever you want to say about Scott forestall, Scott forestall
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:18.080]  knew how to manage large shop software projects. Right. I don't know how much from the outside.
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:21.200]  Now this is somebody who was on the inside who said that. I said, you know, this is,
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:25.360]  this just seems a lot like, like Scott was better at knowing that we should,
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:29.840]  we should kill a couple of these features because we're not, we're not going to ship
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:36.400]  on time otherwise. Um, I, you know, I don't know. That's, I thought that was an interesting
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:40.640]  observation. Maybe that's not true. Maybe there's, you know, people from apple who are listening to
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:44.160]  the show right now, shaking their heads, thinking my God, that Scott was the worst at that. I don't
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:50.720]  know. I'm just saying that's what one person wrote in. Um, but so far two for two major iOS releases
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:56.560]  post forestall. And again, just leaving aside the design style of them, which clearly was in
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:02.320]  opposition to his, you know, his direction. Um, but in terms of how good were they, you know,
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:08.800]  when they shipped in September, they're not that not so good quality wise. And I think in both
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:15.200]  cases it was because of, I think it's too much to do in a year. I honestly think it's too much
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:23.120]  to do in a year. Uh, to be honest, I've heard nothing bad about working under Scott forestall.
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:32.640]  Uh, you know, beyond the, the, the regular apple rigmarole. Right. You know, it was demanding,
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:38.880]  of course. I mean, things like, yeah. Yeah. You're, if you're reporting to Scott forestall,
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:45.040]  you're, you know, you're up there and you did, it's a high pressure job for sure. Right. Um,
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:54.320]  but in general, I have, it's unclear to me why the break with the company happened. Uh, you know,
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:04:01.280]  maybe it was just time to change management, like change it up a little bit. It's unfortunate that
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:10.240]  since then we've had a couple of OS releases, iOS releases that maybe seem a little bit, uh,
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:19.360]  undercooked for lack of a better word. Um, yeah. And I, I know you attribute it to being locked
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:25.920]  to the hardware, but I, I more attributed it to being, um, overzealous with adding features.
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:30.880]  Right. Because I mean, there's two things, right? Like you can, you can either hit the date or you
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:36.400]  can do less stuff. And I would err on this side and certainly in this case, just do less stuff.
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:42.320]  Rather than you can't, you can't change the hardware release. And I think you have to
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.720]  combine that with the new and that, you know, again, from product marketing perspective,
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:50.640]  I totally understand it, but from this style of, we're going to tell you all about it
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:57.360]  at WWTC in June. And I feel like they're, they feel like they're painted in a corner that what
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:03.280]  they've promised in June has to ship in September for the most part. Yes. Yeah.
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:07.360]  And there's a couple of things that don't, but that will be coming in October because they,
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:11.920]  they need Yosemite for them. And it's the same. I've pointed this out before. It's like, I,
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:18.560]  it's like the, um, iCloud key chain was last year. My cloud key chain was a WWDC unveiled feature.
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:23.040]  September iOS seven came out and even though it was in the betas throughout the summer,
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:29.200]  it wasn't in the final version. And then it was there in October in a point release when
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:33.680]  MacOS 10 Maverick shipped, because it somehow needed all of that. You know, and again,
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:37.680]  it goes back to the gears, needing all the, you need all the gears to be there for this thing to
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:42.720]  work. Right. And as I said, at the top of the show, I think the interconnectedness is,
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:50.080]  and, and with the watch too, and you know, the imaginary Apple TV sometime next year.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:55.440]  Yeah. This is just, it's, it's, it's going to keep getting more complicated, right?
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:06:02.640]  Like the, the interoperability is going to end up being a difficult thing to address
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:09.040]  in a lockstep manner. And you need a lockstep, well, you don't need one, but ideally you would
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:15.200]  have a lockstep at least for all of these features. Maybe. And this is me trying to
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:21.520]  play devil's advocate and maybe be taken more optimistic view. Maybe though iOS eight was sort
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:27.200]  of like iOS seven, where iOS seven was this, we have to do all these visuals at once. We have to
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:32.240]  redo the visuals and all these animations and everything that you, all the pixels that are
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:37.680]  thrown on screen across the system at once in nine months. And so of course it was going to be rocky.
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:45.600]  And maybe iOS eight is the same way in terms of laying the foundation for all of this inter-app
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:53.200]  communication, the extensions and all of that. Right. Yeah. Well, and I, and I'll go even
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:07:00.160]  further inter-app and inter-device communication. Good point. Yeah. And that maybe, you know,
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:07.040]  things can slow down in terms of how much happens year over year and that iOS nine and September
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:12.960]  will by nature bite off less because it's going to be about making these things work better and
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:20.080]  more seamlessly rather than starting them from scratch. Yeah, I agree. Which, you know, and,
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:24.880]  and again, I don't want to pretend that I would say to the extension or anything are
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:36.880]  bad, misconceived or poorly done. There's just more rough edges in the OS than you would expect.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:45.280]  And I think that's because of the you know, the, I think they tried to do a lot more in a lot less
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:52.960]  time than, than they, they could really achieve with certainty. Yeah. And I don't think it's in
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:08:02.640]  any way a re refuting the idea that Apple is internally more collaborative than before,
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:07.600]  or that, that they could solve this, that they're still understaffed or something like that.
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:14.400]  I think it's, it's simply the nature of, you know, it's, it's the mythical man month. You can't,
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:20.240]  exactly. You cannot, you really, we, you can actually like almost prove it that you cannot
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:25.680]  ship software, high quality software faster by throwing people at it. You know, and that I do
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:30.640]  think, I think the nature of the features themselves shows that they're, the company is
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:35.120]  more collaborative, but that doesn't mean that you can, that it makes it possible to do this. Like,
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:39.520]  if they weren't, if they were as siloed as they used to be, there's these features wouldn't even
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:50.880]  exist. So do you know who argues against this notion? A smart guy. His name is John Goober
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:58.640]  from back in 2003. This is that, yeah, this came up last night on Twitter and you know what,
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:04.080]  this is a great article. I disagree with a lot of it, as I did at the time, because I don't think
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:09.520]  we, I don't even know if we knew each other, but you know, I'd read you because you're smart and
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:15.120]  just disagree with a lot of your arguments. But this is literally called the good, the bad, on
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:23.840]  the Avi, which is classic Dick move. This was when Avi left, right? It was, it was when Avi left
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:31.840]  and like, yeah, yeah. Soleil, Soleil was like the replacement for the softball guy. But you have,
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:38.800]  you have a couple of, this is when you actually bother to write like a million words. You haven't
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:45.200]  learned to edit yourself yet. But an essential aspect of Mac OS X success is that it didn't
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:51.280]  merely ship, it shipped with discernible momentum. It got better both in terms of performance and
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:56.880]  usability steadily and on a regular schedule. First a public beta and then each would release
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:05.200]  from 10 through two. You go on to say, I feel like a jackass quoting you to yourself, but.
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:09.360]  That's all right. It's my, it's, it's my 11 year old self. So it's like a different person.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:14.160]  It's like a whole different person. This one major update per year schedule is an essential
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:20.320]  aspect of Mac OS X success. The general perception is Mac OS X isn't just good, but that Mac OS X
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:25.680]  is good, but that it's getting and it's good and getting better. That perception seems to be held,
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:30.880]  not just by the Mac community, but the computer industry in general. I think that's an incredibly
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:35.680]  astute point. The, you know, the rest of the article, I couldn't argue with you about a lot,
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:41.840]  but you, you specifically call out the yearly schedule. Yeah. Well, but I'll say this. I
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:46.080]  don't think you're in disagreement with me though. I think though, and, and that was, it was the
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:51.840]  first few years of Mac OS X. It was definitely, I mean, it was very annual. I mean, the first
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:55.680]  release was six months. The 10 one came out. Yeah. And they really needed it. Yeah. And if
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:02.160]  you talk to people who worked on it, they were like, yeah, we had to have to also. Trivia first
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:08.160]  free OS X release. Was it 10 one? 10 one was free. 10 one was free. They just gave it away.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:12.880]  If you went to like any appy dealer. Yeah. It was an apology. They would burn you a DVD and just
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:17.600]  give it to you. And that was when after that though, they were still selling them for $129
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:22.960]  each. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I think about how old I remember being shocked when they started
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:28.400]  dropping the price of the major OS release. Yeah, me too. 129 bucks compared to windows
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:33.760]  seemed reasonable to me. Right. But now it seems like, Oh my God, that would be awful.
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:42.480]  Yeah. No one would upgrade. But I see the thing is though, is that I feel like in those 10,
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:49.760]  one 10, two, 10, three, 10, four. I forget when I slowed down and dropped off the annual cycle,
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:55.760]  maybe around 10, five, but they were, it was, it wasn't two steps forward. One step back. It was
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:01.520]  just two steps forward year after year after year. And there wasn't any kind of, but I mean,
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:05.360]  there might've been niggling details here and there. If we went back and read Syracuse's,
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:10.240]  you know, refresh our minds about what it was, but they were niggles. There wasn't like major
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:15.600]  fundamental things that were here's, here's a big new thing in 10, two, it didn't ship,
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:20.240]  like totally not working. It shipped and it worked. And it was like, Oh, this is more or
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:26.480]  less. I mean, you could complain about spotlight or some weird little, you know, something that
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:31.760]  was broken in the, you know, the first, you know, the GM version and, you know, needed a bug fix.
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:36.400]  So, you know, there are always bugs and, and Syracuse that, yeah, the finder is garbage and
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:44.240]  fine. Nobody was arguing though that nobody was arguing in the 10, one to 10, two to 10,
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:49.440]  three to 10, four era that Apple's trying to do too much year over year. I think it was more like
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:55.120]  what I said in the article that, wow, this they're really on fire and they're just improving the OS
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:59.280]  on a steady basis. Well, you did at the, at the start of the article and I'm trying to find it
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:06.400]  now because I don't want to misquote you, but you, you said something about copious software projects.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:10.720]  The announcement also indicates that the change was more than titular and that
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:14.720]  Cirley will be taking over the responsibility for day-to-day management of the company's
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:20.800]  copious software projects, which at the time did not raise an eyebrow at all.
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:25.440]  Yes, completely correct. Now that's kind of funny. Just thinking about
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:32.960]  it, how the scope and the scale has changed. This is great piece. Like I implore everybody to go
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:40.000]  read this piece. It was a different time for sure. Yeah. I mean, and it was, that piece was also,
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:47.040]  I specifically remember when I wrote it, it was trying to catch up from the fact that
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:56.240]  during fireball didn't start until 2002. And a lot of the, um, the next, the new guys from
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:05.200]  next versus old guys from the max side friction was mostly played out around 99, 2000, 2001,
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:13.440]  before I had daring fireball to do it. And it was a little, I think a little bit, you know,
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:17.040]  like I remember reading this piece and being like, really, are we still doing this?
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:23.520]  Right. But it's smart. And I don't disagree with, I understand a lot of the perspective.
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:30.400]  I still like to, and in hindsight, you know, in hindsight, it's, you know, it's,
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:34.080]  it all worked out for the better, you know, but I've said this before that I still like to think
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:41.520]  that the, the Apple next, um, combination, I know some people have called it a reverse takeover.
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:46.800]  And that's more of a joke though. Yeah. Yeah. But at an executive level, it did happen. Yeah.
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:52.640]  In terms of Steve and the people he picked to directly report to him, it was mostly a reverse.
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:56.800]  Well, whatever it's, it's a marriage. It's a marriage. And the next people ended up
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:01.760]  wearing their pants. Schiller was already there though. And Schiller is there to the state.
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:05.840]  Johnny Ive was there. And Steve, you know, as I said, we kind of picked him out of the,
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:10.560]  he went in, he went in, Steve went into the industrial design group,
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:15.440]  having looked at Apple shipping products and drawn an estimation of the quality of their
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:18.880]  industrial design. He thought, I'm going to have to go in here and fire. All of these people
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:23.680]  walked in and met Johnny Ive and saw the stuff that Johnny Ive had wanted to ship and was like,
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:28.320]  Holy shit, there's a gold mine. These guys are geniuses. Yeah. You know, it was like,
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:33.520]  you know, to be fair to computers at the time, Apple was still shipping some beautiful stuff.
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:42.240]  Go look at a beige G3 266. Just before it had that little sidebar thing. And the way that the
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:48.800]  panel came off with like that, that little bond, it was like a, like a green Bondi blue, almost
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:52.800]  kind of latch that you could just hit. And the side panel would fall off so you could
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:58.800]  access the interior. Way better case design than anybody making PCs.
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:03.200]  Steve I had a Power Mac 9600.
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:13.040]  God, I forget what the chip was in that. Like a 604 that makes a power piece.
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:15.120]  Yeah, I think so. That makes sense. Yeah.
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:20.320]  Steve I think it was before there were rumors of an upcoming 620 that I don't think they ever
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:24.880]  shipped and they did went to the G3 instead. I had a 604 but it was but it had that same thing
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:29.680]  though where you could access the case internals without like tools and stuff like that. You could
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:36.240]  take it apart. Yeah. Not needing a screwdriver. I mean, that was mind blowing at the time.
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:41.440]  Yeah. And everything was super neatly organized inside. It was like going into a like a library
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:45.280]  and it's like, here's where you'd put Ram in. Here's where you do. So if you wanted to add
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:50.320]  Ram or change the Ram, you know, take out your, you know, one gigabyte or gigabyte, probably
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:56.800]  megabyte, one megabyte. Your one megabyte SIMS, remember SIMS? And replace them with two gigabytes
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:02.080]  or whatever. It was easy and that the clips were nice. It didn't feel like you were breaking the
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:05.920]  motherboard by snapping them in. Everything was great, especially, I mean, I'd come from
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:11.360]  a history of building my own PCs, which was awful. Well, I mean, I enjoyed it at the time,
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:16.640]  but you know, needing a screwdriver to get into your case was kind of a pain in the ass. And this
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:24.880]  was the exact opposite of that experience. I remember I had friends in the dorm at Drexel
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:33.200]  who had a built from scratch PC and that they ran it literally where they ran it with the top open.
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:40.800]  They just left it unscrewed and they had to position a box fan, like an actual, like the
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:47.040]  thing you'd put in your window. They put a box fan next to it to keep cool. That's awesome. I had
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:56.080]  just one up here. So I built a second PC so that I could play like network games on it.
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:04.400]  And I didn't buy a case. I literally had a motherboard. The motherboard was sitting
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:09.040]  atop, I swear to God, I'm not making this up. It sounds like I'm just going to make this up.
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:15.120]  It was sitting atop an old issue of Macworld magazine. Long, long way at rest. There was
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:21.120]  like a motherboard with like a VGA card, like literally like a VGA card, a networking card.
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:25.680]  And I think that was it. There was some RAM in there and it was just wired up to a monitor. And
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:31.200]  you know where it was? In my closet in my apartment. And my friends would go in there
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:40.160]  and like sit on a milk crate and we'd play Age of Empires 1 on it. It was like the best
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:45.840]  300 bucks had spent, but it, you know. No, it was like C3PO before they put the
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:50.480]  matter. That didn't happen. Don't talk to me about that.
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:57.920]  But anyway, where I was going is that whatever the hiccups were, you know, the friction,
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:01.760]  the years of friction between two different cultures. I like to think of it in hindsight
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:07.920]  as a reunification that the next side that Jobs created clearly had Apple DNA.
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:09.840]  I couldn't agree more.
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:15.280]  Just, you know, but then they were separated by years like, you know, again, not to draw
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:22.400]  too dramatic an analogy, but like East Germany and West Germany. But then when the wall came down,
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:26.240]  yeah, it was rough for a couple of years because it had been so different on the two sides,
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:27.760]  but they're still all Germans.
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:35.040]  No, so I totally agree. So I came to this from the next point of view, if not actually having
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:44.560]  been super invested in Next. And I would read you and Siracusa and disagree on some of the
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:51.120]  technical issues. But, you know, over the long run, I think we share the same philosophy in
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:56.960]  a lot of ways. I think we're all pretty much of one mind by this point, right?
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:00.240]  Right. Like an insatiable desire for nice things.
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:07.120]  Yes, exactly. And what you attribute to being a nice thing, I think has changed over the years.
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:16.720]  But ultimately, it's the same. Like you say, like a DNA, like there's a commonality there, right?
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:20.480]  Right. And that, you know, once the initial friction was off, but I, you know,
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:25.200]  in those early years, though, I had very strong opinions on a lot of those issues and almost
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:33.120]  always erred on the side of the traditional Mac side of the argument. File name extensions versus,
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:35.280]  you know, type and creator codes, stuff like that.
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:37.600]  Yeah, you got it wrong so often back then.
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:44.560]  No, I was totally right. I was completely right. I maintain. I was totally right. The path,
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:49.920]  the stupid addressing files by path instead of file ID. It's ridiculous.
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:55.760]  I don't disagree. But you're okay with this is like a 20 year old argument at this point. Forget
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:21:00.320]  it. Right. But, you know, I mean, ultimately, if people had done what you wanted them to do,
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:03.040]  it would have been a non starter.
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:08.640]  No, I don't think so. I think it would have it. No, I we would have gotten to where we are now.
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:12.560]  Anyway, it's just where you want us to use new kernel.
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.360]  No, well, I don't know. Did I say that?
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:20.000]  You literally said, I'm not claiming, this is a quote, I'm looking at the website,
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.880]  and this is really unfair. Okay. I don't have anything from this period that you can call me
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:29.040]  on for being stupid. And I'm sure it was stupid in a lot of ways. And I don't even think this is
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:35.280]  stupid, but you literally wrote, I'm not claiming that new kernel was perfect or superior to mock
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:42.160]  in every way. I'm not in any position to make such judgments. That's great. But by all accounts,
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:46.800]  the idea of using new kernel rather than mock was never even considered by Tevinian,
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:54.240]  no matter what advantages it held. Which, yeah, because swapping out a kernel under an ONS
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:22:00.000]  is a pain in the ass. New kernel, remember, was designed from the outset as a kernel
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.800]  to power future power PC based Mac operating systems. Mock wasn't.
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:10.880]  Wait, there's something about power management in here that I really want to find.
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:15.600]  We're going to have to get there to edit this. For one, superior power management,
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:23.040]  a continuing weak spot in Mac OS X. It was. It was. It was. At the time,
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:25.920]  you were completely correct. Now it runs on your phone.
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:33.520]  It's very true. So again, they solved it in a different way. You could say that right,
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:36.880]  but I don't know that it was... I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm just saying that...
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:41.440]  Right. But it was true. The flavor of the commentary was different, right?
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:44.480]  Because there was a cultural divide.
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:50.960]  Right. Yeah, well, you know, the kernel stuff is probably in over my head, but...
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:56.160]  No, I mean, I'm actually not trying to be a jerk here.
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:01.600]  No, but another part too, though, is I didn't know enough about how the next system worked.
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:07.920]  And I was thinking about it more from the OpenStep perspective, which maybe that was
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:11.440]  mock too, but I thought that was a little bit more abstract where it ran on Solaris.
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:14.720]  It was mock and it had a lot of weird stuff and yeah, it could... Well...
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:20.960]  But that because that OpenStep ran on Solaris, I thought that the Coco...
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:24.080]  Well, Coco ran on Solaris, right? Yeah.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:28.800]  You know, and that's what I thought. That more or less was what I was thinking, was that why
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:35.120]  couldn't they take Coco and do on new kernel what they did to get it running on Solaris?
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:37.680]  Maybe that was a terrible idea. Maybe that, you know, that's...
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:40.960]  You know what? I don't know. I honestly don't know.
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:43.760]  I think new kernel is probably kind of brilliant.
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:48.000]  Right. Because they even had the Coco layer running on Windows.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.440]  I mean, that was... They were actually...
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:51.840]  And they actually thought maybe they'd still ship that at first.
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:54.720]  They were going to ship the... They were going to call it yellow box from Windows.
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:59.440]  Yeah, they really could have. I mean, yeah, the OpenStep layer, the Coco layer,
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:04.720]  as we call it today, can ship on a bunch of different OSs. And to be honest,
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:09.200]  probably will in the future. They're eventually going to swap out the underpinnings.
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:13.760]  I shouldn't be passing judgment. Like, from a computer science...
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:17.520]  Well, you literally say, I'm not in any position to make judgments.
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:22.640]  And you said that back in 2003. So I'm really not trying to be a dick about this. I'm just...
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:27.200]  Right. But I'll say... It's funny. It's worth a discussion about.
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:31.520]  Right. But there was... I was expressing the frustrations from a lot of people I knew within
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:37.040]  Apple who were there... From the Mac side, who knew that... Maybe that's just one example,
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:41.680]  but that there was a lot of Mac stuff that wasn't even considered. Just because it was...
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:47.440]  If it wasn't from the next side, it was crap inside of things. And the only stuff that did
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:52.320]  survive was stuff that next didn't even have. Like QuickTime famously survived. And not because
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:56.320]  QuickTime had a great API. QuickTime had a horrible API. I mean, you talk to anybody
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:58.720]  who ever programmed QuickTime... It's a nightmare.
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:03.360]  They get the shakes and you bring it up. But it was the fact that Next didn't have anything.
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:08.880]  They didn't have a multimedia thing. They needed... QuickTime gave them something they
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:11.760]  didn't even have before. You couldn't even play movies on Next machines.
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:16.880]  They replaced QuickDraw with Quartz. Yeah. Well, that was a big win because QuickDraw was...
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:20.080]  Oh, man. Quartz is so much better. They ditched their own thing. They ditched
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:26.400]  a display postscript. Right. Right. That was just... That was one that I don't remember
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.160]  being contentious, though. There might have been some...
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.760]  No, it was one of the best moves that they did with OS X, for sure.
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:37.920]  Right. And the QuickDraw having been designed to do technically amazing things on 1984,
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:42.560]  1985 computers did not make it relevant going into the future.
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:48.160]  Right. Yeah. So, yeah. So Quartz, the composite in Windows Server was way ahead of its time.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:55.600]  Yeah. And at the time, I was frustrated with Syracuse's reviews because he complained about
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:26:02.480]  resizing Windows. Like, why do they resize with Live rather than just the classic macOS
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:11.120]  outline thing? And I was like, because that's cool and it's awesome. But he's right. I've
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:17.840]  come to see the product point of view of it where resizing at five frames per second is
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:25.680]  not... That's not tenable. It's dumb. I remember at the time, that was the years
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:32.640]  that I was working at bare bones software. And we'd get new developer betas of OS X and
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:38.240]  install them on really good hardware. It wasn't like we were installing it on cheapy stuff.
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:46.000]  And I remember watching Jim Korea, who's now at Omni Group with all the goddamn developers.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.600]  But Jim would just open a window and first he would grab the corner and resize it really,
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:57.200]  really fast. And his eyes would start to roll. Then he'd grab the window title bar and just
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:02.080]  shake it over the screen as fast as he could. And you'd see all of this shearing. I mean,
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:06.800]  it was just... There's no way that it could keep up with Jim's hand just going side to side. And
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:12.960]  then he would just roll, just sigh and walk away. So it was so bad. You know what's funny though?
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:19.360]  What I think is so interesting though, is that in between 2000, 2001, Apple, which went for
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:27.440]  looks beautiful, even if it is painfully slow, to 2006 Apple making the first version of iOS,
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:36.400]  which looked beautiful, but never got slow, was that it was a subtle shift in priorities, where...
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:40.080]  I disagree with that characterization. But, sorry, finish your thought.
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:45.440]  Here's the example. The example is you load Daring Fireball and Mobile Safari on the original iPhone
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:50.320]  running iOS 1.0 and you start to scroll. What do you see? You saw that checkerboard. Remember
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:56.080]  the checkerboard in iOS? So the scrolling always kept up with your finger, but they would just dump
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:00.400]  the content and show a checkerboard if they needed to. So it always felt like it was perfectly
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:09.120]  responsive with your finger. But it wasn't showing you the content in high fidelity. And in fact,
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:13.920]  with the checkerboard, it would just drop it completely. And I thought that was one of the
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:21.840]  most genius decisions in all of the original iOS 1.0, was that checkerboard. Of course, clearly the
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:26.880]  ultimate answer was to just keep up with your finger with the actual content, which is what all
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:34.720]  iPhones do today. But in terms of what they should do then, the macOS 10 1.0 solution would have been
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:41.120]  for the iOS to do really jittery, shearing scrolling, have scrolling get real slow
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:47.280]  as you scroll a big long web page. And what they came up with in 2007 was delightful.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:53.200]  Even though it was disappointing slightly at first that, oh, I can't keep the whole page there.
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:57.520]  But the fact that no matter what you did, what you saw, those checkerboards moving up in the
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:04.000]  screen kept pace with your finger was to me delightful. So I agree. I was initially going
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:16.080]  to disagree, but yeah, the instant interaction is always better. What I liked about macOS 10
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:23.600]  at the time when it was released was that it was betting on the future, like hard. Harder than it
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:29.520]  really should have because at the time when it shipped the product, I liked because I was more
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:37.040]  of on the nerdy side of the scale. Like I could see what they were doing. But it wasn't a great
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:42.480]  product. Well, and it's harder to bet on the future when you're behind. Right. But they did,
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:49.040]  they bet hard and Microsoft had to catch up years later with Vista, which comically late to the game
[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:55.600]  at that point. Right. Well, and at the same time that OS 10 was shipping more or less roughly 2000,
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:30:01.440]  2001. I mean, 2001 was actually when XP shipped. But Microsoft was shipping what would go on to be
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:07.360]  the single most popular version of Windows that ever shipped. And I think it's quite possible,
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:13.600]  maybe that ever will ship. They might be in some, if not decline, like they've hit a permanent
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:18.800]  plateau and they'll never be as popular. No new version of Windows will ever be as popular as XP
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:24.160]  was. Do you find that a bit of a bummer? I don't know how you feel about that.
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:28.320]  Yeah, I think it's, I think it's a little depressing because I feel like it'd be better,
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:32.800]  you know, best thing that, you know, clearly the one of the best things that's happened to iOS
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:38.160]  is Android getting its design act together. Right. You know, whether, you know, well,
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:46.800]  I mean, so I'm not that much of a, you know, the market is God kind of kind of person. I just like
[01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:53.760]  to see everybody doing awesome stuff all of the time. And it's not happening. Right. Right. It
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:57.600]  would be better. It's just better in general if other people are doing awesome stuff. And it's
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:03.040]  also, but you know, and then from a more objective point of view, it does keep everybody on their
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:10.560]  toes. Oh yes. Yeah. You know, you know, just going back to the main thesis of this episode
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:16.080]  where we're talking about is Apple doing too much per year. Maybe it's better if they do a little
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:21.600]  bit too much per year than do a little too little to eat per year. Right. As a general rule of thumb,
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:27.280]  if they have to err on one side or the other, and because humans are imperfect and because software
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:33.440]  planning is imperfect and software management is imperfect and software engineering is certainly
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:37.840]  imperfect, you're never going to get it exactly right. So if you have to take a guess whether
[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:41.360]  you're going to go a little too fast or a little too slow, it might be better to go too fast.
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:47.920]  So, you know, well, and so I agree with you, but I'm going to have to, I'm going to play devil's
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:54.080]  advocate for the sake of conversation. Just before the show, you sent me the link that
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:32:00.160]  says that iOS 8 adoption has stagnated compared to iOS 7 adoption.
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:10.640]  If that keeps happening, that is, that's a bad sign, right? I think this, I think it's a really
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:16.960]  bad sign. So it's, and these are Apple's own numbers, which is really interesting. I don't
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:22.960]  want to say damning, but right. So Apple, Apple has a webpage on there. It's the app store support
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:29.120]  page for developers. And it tells you at like, it's like a once a week snapshot. I think it's
[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:33.600]  once a week. I don't know the, as we record today on October 7th, the data comes from October 5th,
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:40.640]  two days ago. And it just tells you of devices that have come to the app store in the last,
[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:43.920]  I don't know, is it a week or something like that? Here's what OS they were running.
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:50.160]  And as of, you know, 20 days after the release of iOS 8, it's about a 50 50 split.
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:58.320]  iOS 7 is at 47%. iOS 8 is at 47% and earlier versions, the remaining 6%. The reason that's
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:02.720]  bad. That's a, that's really, to be fair, that's better than most other people in the industry.
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:11.600]  Yeah, but it's really a year ago, iOS 7, 20 days after it came out, was at 70%. Right. Which is not,
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:17.840]  it's not like that's well within, you know, outside, like, statistical variation.
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:25.760]  You know, that's a big difference. That's what is at 24%. And, you know, there might be,
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:31.280]  almost certainly it's multifaceted the reasons why, but I don't think it's outlandish at all.
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:39.680]  I think it's almost certain that part of it is that people out there feel like they've either
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:45.680]  had bad experiences in the past when they've okayed the, okay, a software update is available.
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:51.280]  Do you want to install it? And now they're more likely to hit cancel than they were otherwise.
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:57.040]  Or it's just what they're hearing from people about iOS 8. That, oh, don't do it. You know, wait.
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:07.280]  I've, as I said, I told Adrienne not to update. And she'd already heard it from people at work.
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:14.880]  Uh, that's, that's a bad sign like that. You can't do that.
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:20.720]  Yeah. Like Ben Thompson on last week's episode of this show with Ben Thompson, I just said offhand,
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:24.320]  I said, you know, that's the long term. If they keep having OS releases like that,
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:28.000]  it seems inevitable that, that it's going to slow the pace of adoption,
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.080]  which is not in Apple's interest. And it's not in the interest of third-party developers. Like,
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:39.760]  it's been a very virtuous circle for Apple because their newest features are in front of more people.
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:44.720]  And it, you know, if it works well, it makes people feel like, Hey, my, my year old iPhone
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:48.560]  is even better than it was a year ago because I've got these cool new features. And it's good
[01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:56.000]  for developers because when new, new developer technologies come out, they can adopt them quicker
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:02.320]  than, you know, right away, you know, like the new auto layout stuff and adaptive, uh, size stuff
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:08.640]  for new screens. You can do that even though it's iOS eight only because Apple promises that,
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:12.000]  you know, a majority of customers are going to be running iOS eight very soon.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:19.920]  Well, I think like, it's almost absurd that you can, um,
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:25.760]  like a great lens to look at Apple is to look at the, the order of priorities, right.
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:32.400]  Which is at this point, pretty basic, it's Apple, their customers, and then third-party developers.
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:32.560]  Right.
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:42.080]  Uh, I think that, you know, shipping buggy OS updates initially hurts their own customers,
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:43.920]  and that's probably what they care about the most. Right.
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:44.720]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:46.960]  And that's, that's what they care about the most.
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:50.720]  And that's probably what they care about the most. Right. And then their customers won't
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:55.360]  update and that's going to trickle down into third-party developers. And then that's the,
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:00.320]  you know, given the cycle of life, like the feedback loop, uh, if third-party developers
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:06.960]  can't count on customers, how many up the OS updated, they can't adopt the good, the,
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:15.600]  the good stuff that Apple has released and wants people to do. Uh, it's, it's a horrible cycle.
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:24.320]  So, uh, yeah, as, as a developer, that sucks that, you know, maybe I can't count on these
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:32.720]  new things, but I think, I think Apple should probably serve their customers first. Like
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:39.920]  I understand the priority system. I think they've failed their own customers in, in a certain way
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:47.200]  to some small degree, you know? Yeah. It might be, you know, that you can't overestimate,
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:56.240]  underestimate, I don't know, whichever, whatever way works, how much damage you can do to the trust
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:03.600]  between the typical user, which of which there are now hundreds of millions of them. So they're
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:10.320]  not technical people at all. They're just people who want to have an iPhone that works or an iPad.
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:13.920]  And the trust that they have an Apple, when that dialogue box comes up and says,
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:18.080]  a new version of iOS eight is available for your device, click, you know, tap here to install.
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:25.600]  Because I think once you've said no once, why would you not say no again, the second time,
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:32.240]  like what you have to, you've been trained that everything's great and then something bit you.
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:37.600]  Yeah. There's a little boy who cried wolf angle to it. And that's slightly a bad metaphor because
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:42.080]  that the, the kid in that allegory is a liar and Apple's not doing this on purpose. They're not
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:46.960]  lying. Clearly everybody with an Apple wishes that all these features worked perfectly.
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:50.560]  Also, I hate that story because it's dumb to show up every time the kid calls wolf,
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:55.680]  like, just do it. Just appoint a new kid. Just get the kid off it though.
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:59.040]  There's better solutions to this problem.
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:02.400]  Yeah. You know what? You're going to work. You're going to work inside from now on.
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:04.800]  Anyway, sorry, I cut you off.
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:10.000]  But yeah, but the, the, the townspeople's reaction though is human nature, you know,
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  where if you feel like you've been burned a couple of times and you feel like, Hey, I, you know,
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:19.440]  my iPad got kind of slow when I installed iOS seven, uh, it is going to make you less likely
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:26.960]  to do it. And I know that that, that whole aspect gets, you know, the jackass way to overstate it is
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:32.880]  that whole thing that came up last year where that it was planned obsolescence and infuriated me.
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:37.280]  Well, here's what, and I think now we're seeing why it's so infuriating, right? So last year there
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:41.280]  were, there was, there were people like in the New York times, I forget who, but a couple of people
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:45.920]  chirping in that, Hey, I upgraded my old iPhone. It's a year old or it's two years old. And now
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:50.720]  it's slower. Apple did that on purpose because they want me to buy a new iPhone. And I thought
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:55.440]  that was so stupid because it has so little respect for people. Like if Apple had done
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:00.880]  that on purpose, isn't it a natural response for somebody who says, Hey, I had, I paid a lot of
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:06.400]  money for my iPhone. I did what Apple told me to do and it got slower. Maybe I should try a
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:11.280]  Samsung phone or something. I mean, that's a little bit of culture, the market kind of thing
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:16.000]  for me personally, but I see your point. I do. I understand where you're coming from. That's
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.320]  perfectly rational reaction to it. Yeah. I, you know, that's what I would think if it had been
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:26.000]  the case. Yes. But yeah. Take the politics out of the fact that Android versus iOS is sort of
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:31.360]  a political thing where we've, we've got, we've got tribes, you know, that you and I are part of
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:37.920]  this, you know, Mac indie Mac iOS. Yeah. I like to pretend that I'm not, but yeah, fair enough.
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:43.120]  Yeah. Take it to something where there's, there's less, you know, religious style fervor. And we
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:48.160]  try, I do hope that I do too, that I kind of try to stay above that and keep my mind open as best
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:53.120]  I can, but there's no doubt. And it's there in the people who listen to our show and stuff like
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:58.080]  that. But just, I'm just saying though, that like, if you buy, let's say two brands that are really
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:03.120]  close and intertwined in their histories and in their reputations, Honda and Toyota, right. That
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:08.080]  they're both Japanese and they both have this reputation for quality and for durability that,
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:11.920]  you know, you can buy a Honda or a Toyota and it's very good likelihood. It's going to last
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:16.320]  for over a hundred thousand miles. Uh, and that's, you know, you bought Toyota's two,
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:21.200]  two or three cars in a row and then you buy a Toyota and you get a bad one and it's, you know,
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:26.240]  has transmission problems two years in. Doesn't that make you more likely to think, Hey, maybe I
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:30.880]  should try a Honda next time. Right. It doesn't make you think I bet Toyota did this on purpose
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:35.280]  because they want me to buy another car. Right. That's just, it's counter to the brand and the
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:41.520]  Apple brand is we make good stuff and it lasts at least in terms of technology where it lasts long.
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:47.920]  Um, and anything that, anything that goes against that is off the brand and off the message and off
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:52.800]  the relationship that they want to have with their customers. Um, so I really think that
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:59.200]  that whole idea that, that, that it's planned obsolescence, that new versions of iOS run poorly
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:06.080]  on or less, even less than ideally on older devices. It's not just wrong. Cause I know from
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:09.360]  the people I know at Apple, the people I know at Apple would quit if they were told, Hey,
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:16.880]  make this run slow on an iPhone. I mean that sincerely. I had the conversation with a friend
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:20.880]  at WWDC who rolled his eyes about and said, literally I would quit if, if my boss came
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:24.560]  into me and told me to do something like that, I would just immediately, I would just say, okay.
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:27.920]  And then I would just pack up my stuff. He goes, I can get a job somewhere else. I'm not gonna,
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:31.600]  you know, why would I do something like that? That's, you know, evil is the wrong way. That's
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:35.520]  not what he said, but I would have no respect for myself if I did that. That's not how they do it.
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:41.520]  That's no, that's honestly Apple, Apple, if anything, Apple is
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:47.680]  facing a crisis of talent retention. Yeah. And that's the sort of thing that would make
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:50.800]  it worse. If you start being like, well, you know what? Cripple a phone in a year.
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:57.920]  Right. It's like, fuck you. I'll go. Do you have much money that can get that elsewhere?
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:01.920]  Like it's fine. Like these people can get a job wherever they want.
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:04.800]  Right. Like the people I know at Apple are the opposite where they would take
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:08.880]  pride in the fact that, you know, I worked on, you know, I don't know, I worked on,
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:14.320]  you know, this UI list view scrolling and it's still buttery smooth on an iPhone 4S.
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:19.040]  I totally agree with you. Right. And that's like, that's a feather in my cap that it's,
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:23.840]  you know, that one, I wrote it 100%. Nobody is trying to make anything slow.
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:30.640]  Right. And I think that this thing to go back to this, you know, that the upgrade pace is apparently
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:37.600]  significantly off year over year is to me, like I said, a canary in a coal mine that those sort of,
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:43.040]  Hey, if you keep doing this, it's going to affect it. That it's come to fruition that we've got a
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:48.800]  dead Canary here. I feel like it's a sprinter that is hit a stride that's like a little bit
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:54.000]  off and it's almost stumbling at this point. Right. And instead of saying like, Hey, this
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:59.120]  could happen, you know, it's actually happening. And we're seeing, you know, here, the last
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:04.720]  lap around the track was slower. Right. It's not just, it's not just you and I, the commentators
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:09.200]  in the booth speculating that maybe he's slower. The runner is slower that it's hate, you know,
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:14.880]  can clock it. Yeah. Yeah. The pace is off. Very, very worrisome to me. I haven't linked it up on
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:18.480]  during far. I probably will before the show hits, but I think it's, and there's a couple of, somebody
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:23.040]  else has data that backs it up to mix panel. I don't know who they are, but the stuff from Apple,
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:28.080]  I trust. Yeah. I mean, it's the wrong numbers, right? So kind of, you know,
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:34.960]  so kind of I'd imagine you can hold them to their own numbers that I don't know why you wouldn't
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.800]  want to. I think, I think that they'll, it's not like, and I don't think it's too late. I
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:45.520]  don't think they can not turn, you know, but I feel like, I think though that they've got to
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:52.880]  shift priorities subtly in favor of higher quality, even at the expense of doing less
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:58.880]  in the same amount of time. Well, I mean, is it too late for the next cycle? I don't know.
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:06.320]  Yeah. I don't know. Uh, Mark Gurman reported that, uh, nine to five Mac that, uh, that they've got
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:13.200]  8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 in testing, which is different than all most previous years. They've only done
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:19.680]  a 0.1. Um, and I, you know, who knows if that's the case or not? I'm, it was unclear from his
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:24.560]  report how much of that was just coming from user agent strings that, that they saw at nine to five
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:31.680]  Mac in Google analytics, which are easily fake. Yeah. I'm hesitant to, but he also suggested
[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:37.520]  though, that he'd spoken to people who, who backed that up 8.2. He's great. He's got good
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:47.280]  sourcing a lot of the time. Uh, I'm hesitant to, you know, to ascribe anything to version numbers
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:55.920]  or like, you know, the, the, the six plus is I believe iPhone six, seven comma two. Yeah. Six
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:45:01.600]  is seven comma one. It does not matter. Those things don't get assigned until way later in the
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:10.240]  process. Uh, no. And the code names were weird too. Uh, the plus was N 56, six. Yeah. The six
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:15.600]  was N 61. I hadn't heard those, but they're arbitrary. I think we've both been told that
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:22.080]  they're yeah. Don't make any sense. Yeah. Yeah. Like for example, yeah. Like for example,
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:29.200]  the fact that the six is N 61 and the plus is N 56 doesn't mean that the six came after
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:33.760]  there's no rhyme. It doesn't mean that there were four iterations between it.
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:38.400]  There's no rhyme or reason to any of this stuff. It is apparently just a, you know,
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:43.440]  there's an open slot at N 56 here. Take it. You call it your device, the N 56, right?
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:48.880]  Yeah. But people inside Apple get really used to calling it by those divide, those names.
[01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:54.720]  Like, well, yeah. I mean, why wouldn't you? That's right. Yeah. But, but there's, there's no
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:46:00.720]  rhyme or reason. Yeah. Right. Right. And the easiest thing to fake or fudge or whatever in
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:10.560]  the world is the user agent string of a browser. I know Don has stories about that. Uh, all right.
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:15.360]  Let me take a third break here, but then we'll wrap up the show, but I want to thank our, uh,
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:23.680]  third and final sponsor of this episode, uh, right back week after week from last week. It's a U bar.
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:30.560]  It's a Mac utility. It's a dock replacement for the Mac and it can be configured in a bunch of
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:36.480]  ways. Um, you can configure it as a replacement for the Mac iOS dock. That sort of same style.
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:42.560]  Uh, or if you're a windows convert to the Mac or just a Mac user who likes the windows style task
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:49.040]  bar, um, you bar has a, uh, configuration options that you can set it up to be a lot more task bar
[01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:54.800]  like than doc like. Uh, so if you refer prefer a doc, you can configure it that way. If it's
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:59.440]  a task bar, you can do it that way. Um, but no matter how you configure it, it looks great.
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:05.840]  It's pure OS 10. It's, it's just a Mac utility. It's all written really native. Um, the developer
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:10.000]  I still, I mentioned this last week, but it's so fascinating to me. His hobby is one of his hobbies
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:16.880]  is, is mechanical watchmaking. Uh, and it really shows like, and really, really nice handmade
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:21.360]  mechanical watches with, you know, just everything you'd think, you know, really fine attention to
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:26.640]  the typography on the dials and the shape and exact length of the hands and everything like
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:33.760]  that. You bar looks like software from someone who makes precision watches really does to me.
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:38.880]  Um, but it's got a bunch of added features, nerdy features, stuff, sort of stuff that if you listen
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:44.000]  to the talk show, you might be interested in. So it sort of also adds the features of activity
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:51.040]  monitor right into your task bar, your doc. So if you hold the control key, uh, on your keyboard,
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:57.040]  while you scrub across apps in the doc, it, it replaces the CPU name, uh, or the app name with
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:03.840]  the CPU and Ram usage for each process running in your doc. Uh, you can spot unresponsive apps
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:09.360]  immediately. An app that's, you know, doing the spinning pizza of death, uh, gets a flag right in
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:15.840]  the, right in the dock right away. Tons of customers, customization, light and dark themes,
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:21.120]  just like in Yosemite. Uh, you can add favorites for quick access or have it just show the apps
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:25.600]  that are running. Uh, and the developer he's right. He's working like mad. He's really
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:32.320]  just focused on this. Um, you bar 2.0 launched in July and there's already been 30 updates.
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:38.080]  Uh, and they sponsored the show last episode and he emailed me and said the response from listeners
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:43.200]  has been phenomenal. A bunch of listener suggestions have already been implemented in
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:49.360]  Ubar through updates just since last week. Uh, and he's been blown away by how smart and enthusiastic
[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:56.000]  and, uh, Allah's dad, how good looking, uh, the, the audience that listens to this show is, um,
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:01.360]  he's already had, he had the Apple store business specialists emailed him because customers started
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:06.880]  asking about Ubar after he was on the show last week. That's great. And it, a Japanese user spent,
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:11.600]  sent him an email saying that a typhoon was on its way to Japan, which gave him free time because he
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:17.280]  didn't have to go to work. And so he sent over a full Japanese translation, uh, of the, the user
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:23.600]  interface. So G bar is now just since the last episode of the talk show, it is now localized in
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:27.600]  Japanese due to a typhoon. So I, hopefully everybody's okay from the typhoon. I don't want
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:33.040]  to say the typhoon was good news. Really, really, really interesting software. I had not heard of
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:37.280]  this utility before and it's really, really interesting. I it's certainly not for everybody.
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:42.160]  That's the whole point of things like doc replacements and, and, you know, launch bar
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:48.160]  and Alfred and, and apps like that. Um, that, that sort of thing is not for everybody, right?
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:53.280]  Alfred and launch bar are not supposed to replace spotlight for everybody. Spotlight's the interface.
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:59.280]  That's like, that's for like hundreds of millions of people. Things like Ubar is, you know, for
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:03.920]  geeks who want to customize stuff really, really interesting. Normally the app is 20 bucks, which
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:09.040]  is a steal for software like this, but here's the password or the code, uh, the coupon code
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:18.320]  Gruber addition, all one word. It's like the, the watch Gruber edition. Um, and you get 50% off,
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:26.560]  meaning it's just 10 bucks, 50% off 10 bucks for an amazing app from a developer who's clearly very,
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:30.560]  very responsive to requests. So I wouldn't be surprised if you looked at it and thought,
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:34.640]  well, if it just did one more thing, maybe I would send this suggestion in. Here's where you
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:44.160]  go to find out more who bar U B a r app.com you bar app.com and the coupon code, all one word
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:54.480]  Gruber edition. Nice. Like gold, pure, pure gold Gruber. It has been, it's been like eight days
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:57.760]  since the episode came out, but I thought, my God, that's a lot to happen in a week. Yeah,
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:05.360]  that seems awesome. That's great. Uh, and you know, it's, it's not even like a Sherlocking
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:10.480]  because he's, you know, like these kinds of things have been, yeah, it's reverse Sherlocking. Like
[01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:18.480]  this is, this is destined and intended for ACEs. Like if you, are you a Mac ACE? Go get this.
[01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:25.120]  Right. Yeah. It's like, you know, BB edit is, was not Sherlocked when they included text edit
[01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:30.400]  in the system. Right. It's like, if you need it, you, you know, you need it. Whereas Apple
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:35.600]  is focusing on the, um, you know, all across the board, like that's the way you survive when Apple
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:40.960]  has a built-in app that does the thing that you do. Yeah. Busy Cal, busy Cal gets by, by doing
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:47.120]  more and better than the built-in calendar app. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you, you ship a notes app,
[01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:54.720]  right? And you're moving to the Mac. So, you know, all right. You can, you can, you can,
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:58.240]  you've got to just look at it and say, we can do better. And you have to look at it and say,
[01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:02.560]  Apple is always going to do something that's sort of very, very basic for the built-in thing.
[01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:06.640]  Yeah. No, I, I totally agree. Um, where were we?
[01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:16.560]  Uh, you tell me, I don't know. I think we were talking about, um, we were wrapping up,
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:20.880]  I think the discussion on, on the annual cycle. Is that fair? Is that right?
[01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:27.040]  Yeah. Um, like where, where, where do we think that they should go from here and
[01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:33.360]  all right. And how about that? And, and you know what, honestly, uh, I think that at this point,
[01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:40.320]  the, um, I think one of the problems is they've committed themselves to doing a major revision
[01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:50.320]  every year. And that is, and as much as I love marketing at Apple, like done, done correctly,
[01:52:50.320 --> 01:53:01.680]  um, I, I don't think that you can commit yourself to doing as many new features per year as they
[01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:06.560]  have been committing themselves to do and integrating into across all of the product
[01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:14.560]  lines from the Mac to iOS to the watch and eventually to the Apple TV stuff, which
[01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:19.680]  maybe that's a minor point, but it, it'll, you know, it'll eventually be a thing. Um,
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:28.560]  I, I don't know what to do. I mean, maybe just get away from numbers at that point, right? Like,
[01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:35.040]  does it need to be iOS nine next year? Or can it just be like, here's our latest iOS?
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:38.400]  Yeah. I don't know though.
[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:43.440]  I don't know either. I really don't know. But, but what's happening is,
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:45.920]  what's happening is untenable. I feel.
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:50.880]  I see the sense of that, of getting rid of version numbers, but on the other hand,
[01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:54.720]  and it's like, I really don't know what version numbers mean to people. Like what does,
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:59.440]  what does my dad think when his iPad says that iOS 8.0 is available?
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:53:59.680]  Right.
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:04.320]  How much of that is gibberish and how much of it does he get the basic idea that they're just,
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:08.560]  you know, it's a new number. I don't know. I mean, he's never, you know,
[01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:15.600]  But, but I, but I do want, so that's a, that's a great point, but I do wonder if that internally,
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:22.080]  and because they're so involved in the industry and the, that particular way of looking at things,
[01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:30.400]  they see a new version number, meaning major new features. Maybe you don't need that, you know,
[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:39.040]  like maybe, you know, that I, and I know this is off beaten path or, or what's the phrase. I don't
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:48.880]  know. Yeah. A horse that's been beaten a lot. Somebody has been beaten. Yeah. But to compare
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:55.840]  the version, to compare software version numbers to, the automobile industry and nobody's confused
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:55:04.160]  when they say the new 2015 Honda Accord. Right. But the 2016 Honda Accord may not be, it's only
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:09.040]  every four, three, four, five years that they actually do like a, wow, it's altogether new.
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:14.720]  It's a new drive train. It's a new, you know, a new body shape, you know, and in between,
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:19.840]  you know, the years they're incremental. Right. But they don't label them differently and they
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:26.400]  might advertise it more when there's a major new change, right? When they truly upgrade the body
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:31.280]  and it make it look a lot more modern and it's bigger and it has a major new technology in the
[01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:35.760]  engine. They might spend more on the ad campaign that year than they did the year before when it
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:40.880]  was an incremental version of the one before, but they still just give it a new year and they just
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:49.040]  say it's the 2016 Honda Accord and you know, and that seems to work pretty well for them.
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:52.800]  I don't know. And I always thought that that was sort of what Microsoft was going for when
[01:55:52.800 --> 01:56:00.160]  they went from Windows 3.0 to 3.1 to Windows 95 was. Right. Let's not bother people with,
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:05.440]  and then, you know, Windows 98 and then they, you know, I guess there was a Windows 2000,
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:10.160]  but then they were ran in a different direction with XP because I think maybe because they were.
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:16.080]  I think that was a good idea, but you know, they would announce something and then ship a year
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:20.400]  later and I think that bit them and they, they got cold feet. Yeah, that they were having,
[01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:24.880]  they were, yeah. And, and it, they weren't doing it annually. And so you were still running
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:30.640]  office 98 in the year 2001 and it felt old. Whereas if it had just been a version number,
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:34.800]  you might not think that, whereas it really seemed like, and I don't know, maybe there was
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:39.600]  something even that made it worse about crossing the millennium and still running, you know,
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:46.320]  maybe, but I mean, I works 11. Yeah, that was kind of awful. I think Apple kind of stepped in that
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:51.920]  exact same. Right. So Apple had stepped in the same thing. Yeah. I work 11 was, was up to date
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:58.560]  up until. And it's funny because some people still like it better. Yeah. So that's awkward.
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:03.920]  They had a bit of a Microsoft moment in a microcosm right there. Right. And it's just the
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:10.080]  case that, you know, even the companies that are functioning well, it's just so takes so long to
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:16.640]  ship big software projects. Right. So yeah, I don't know if getting rid of version numbers would be
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:21.520]  the problem. I don't know if just doing less in each one and letting, you know, like as other,
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:26.160]  a couple of people have called it having a snow leopard moment. And, you know, like Apple said
[01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:37.120]  with snow leopard features, right? No, no, what a great ballsy move. I can't think of any other
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:45.360]  company in the industry ever, literally ever. That is, had a big event saying we have nothing
[01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:50.160]  new. Right? We're just going to spill we've, we're just going to spend this next, you know,
[01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:54.400]  couple of months. And, you know, yeah, we've spent the last few months and we're going to keep
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:59.280]  spending the next few months, you know, cleaning up the foundation. Which if we're honest was
[01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:06.480]  effectively a misdirection because they had GCD, they had a bunch of API changes under the hood.
[01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:10.880]  Yeah. They had done a lot of work, but it was something user features, right? Yeah. It was
[01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:16.480]  really hard to market. Right. GCD. Yeah. That was when GCD is a perfect example where I think
[01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:22.320]  that's when they killed garbage collection too in favor of arc. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. And I think
[01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:27.920]  Syracuse have pointed out perfectly in his review that, you know, no new features does not mean he
[01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:33.280]  had nothing to write about. If anything, he had as much to write about as ever before because he
[01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:39.760]  cares deeply about that sort of stuff. But from like, what do you tell normal people who are
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:44.240]  just coming in for a new Mac book? Well, what's new in Snow Leopard? It's well, we've cleaned
[01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:48.880]  it up under hood and it runs more efficiently. It's not the answer is it's better, right? Like
[01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:55.040]  better than seeing it in conversation. But it's, you know, it was a fact that though,
[01:58:55.040 --> 01:59:00.640]  that a lot of engineering resources had been committed to and devoted to things like GCD
[01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:07.520]  and arc and stuff like that, that wasn't user facing. And, you know, again, it's in a sense,
[01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:13.120]  sometimes, or not even sometimes, almost always the best marketing is to be completely honest,
[01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:20.000]  you know, and even if it sounds like a funny thing for a tech company to say no new features. I don't
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:24.320]  know, it went over well with everybody I know. And I think in hindsight, it was a great release.
[01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:31.040]  I agree. But I do, you know, kind of everybody, you know, and everybody I know is right that,
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:37.920]  you know, that's a bit of a small window, right? Yeah, but you know, it is tech tech wise, right?
[01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:44.240]  But think about the people you know. You know, like, like with Adri, like with you recommending
[01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:48.800]  that she not update? Wouldn't you like to be able to tell her next year with iOS nine? Yeah,
[01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:52.800]  just go ahead and update. It's just gonna make your phone run faster. Like, really,
[01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:56.160]  if you really believe that that was the case, don't you think that would go over well with her?
[01:59:56.160 --> 02:00:00.800]  I mean, oh, yeah, yeah, like, like restoring a little bit of faith and stuff. I mean,
[02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:09.360]  I already told her like 802, whatever, eight. Yeah, 802. Do it. Go for it. It's gonna be good.
[02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:14.320]  I think there's still like a little bit of trepidation. But yeah, like next year,
[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:21.120]  I just want to get it's fine. I get crap from Amy. I do like, I think like a lot of people like
[02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:27.680]  she had iTunes match turned on. And she updated she got a new phone and she updated or she had
[02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:31.440]  to update because she got a new phone. And I said all of her music was there. And then she went to
[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:36.800]  the gym. And there was like, no music on the phone. And I was like, that's welcome to iTunes
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:42.800]  match. And she blamed me because she just, you know, she knows that I don't work at Apple. And I
[02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:48.320]  certainly, you know, I had nothing to do with iTunes match. But she blames me at that the cloud
[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:53.280]  is just unreliable. And I said, I'll tell you, I think that what I did is I turned off iTunes
[02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:57.760]  match. And I have all the music I want. It's on my computer. And I just sync to iTunes the old
[02:00:57.760 --> 02:01:01.680]  fashioned way. So I say here, give me your phone turned off iTunes match, plugged it into her Mac,
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:07.600]  and sync and said, put all of her music on it. And now all of her music is there. And she's never
[02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:11.840]  going to complain again. But I would love to have been able to say to her Yeah, just upgrade to iOS
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:17.920]  eight. And it fixes all the iTunes match issues. Yeah, that makes sense to me. I haven't actually
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:23.760]  ever used iTunes match. But there's a lot of little things with the cloud stuff that works
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:28.240]  like that. Well, that's, yeah, that's what I'm saying. Like, I used to really worry about backing
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:34.320]  up my iTunes library, because I bought that. And if my hard drive died, I'd be screwed.
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:43.120]  That's mostly no longer the case. Yeah, man. Yeah, I don't care anymore. I buy a new device,
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:48.480]  and I've got all of it. At least it lists everything that I've ever bought, and I can watch
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:55.280]  and, you know, I can buy my new phone, and I can watch Casino Royale on it, because I bought it
[02:01:56.160 --> 02:02:03.040]  years ago. So I don't I don't really care about that kind of stuff that much anymore.
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:08.800]  Well, I think music and not to go on a total iTunes attention, but I think music is very
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:15.760]  different from movies. Because with movies, if you're, you know, it, you don't necessarily,
[02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:20.240]  there's no real good reason to have all of your movies with you all the time on your local device.
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:26.960]  The only time I worry about is if I'm gonna go on a flight. Yeah, something. And even then,
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:31.280]  you're probably only gonna load a handful of them. And you can stand to just sit there and wait.
[02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:36.080]  Whereas if you're, you know, want to listen to music for the next 90 minutes, and you don't have
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:40.320]  any of it on your device, right? It's, you know, it's a pain in the ass if you have to sit there
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:45.440]  and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait. Yeah, music's a little different. Yeah, that's
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:49.280]  right. And for the most part, this stuff does still just work where you get a new device and
[02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:53.520]  sign in. And even if you don't restore from a backup, and you just sign into your iCloud
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:57.680]  account, and you say, what was that book that I book I bought, and I wanted to look it back up,
[02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:01.360]  there it is, and you hit the cloud button and just comes down. But it doesn't always work.
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:10.640]  Sometimes it just, you know, the download gets stuck. So what's your take on this yearly update
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:21.120]  thing? You know, john Gruber in 2003 seemed to think it was a great idea. I think what like,
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:25.360]  what would be your like, how would you frame this discussion? Now, you know, if you had to rewrite
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:29.440]  this piece, well, not the whole piece, but I wouldn't, I think that they I think that they
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:36.320]  should go there. I think the annual pace is probably fine, and actually probably helps keep
[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:42.320]  them in check. But I think that they should consider doing less per year, and polishing
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:53.040]  more. And if they can figure out a way to let some ideas operate, you know, well, if you get it done,
[02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:57.440]  then you're in but if you don't, but then maybe not advertising them at W maybe promising less at
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:08.720]  WWDC, and maybe slating some of those things for at a 9.2 update in March of 2016.
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:12.720]  That does make it hard for developers. And it makes it hard for customers. Well,
[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:16.240]  more importantly, from Apple's perspective, customers, right, like you need to,
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:24.400]  I think the reason that they stick to hard version numbers is that that is the gate for
[02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:31.040]  functionality. Right. And it is. And so many other things are annual at Apple, the phones come out on
[02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:36.320]  an annual basis. And for competitive reasons, they really do need to, because their competitors come
[02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:41.520]  out with a new Apple can only come out with one set of new phones every year is slow compared
[02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:48.720]  to everybody else in the industry. Oh, yeah, it's, and it was a glacial, but it's, it's delivered
[02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:53.840]  delivered in an industry where there's not much deliberation, where it's sort of, as soon as you
[02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:58.960]  know, if you can ship it, let's ship it and see if people will buy it. But Apple is very deliberative,
[02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:02.880]  and they have to be but then they run into things where if they're going to sell 100 million of the
[02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:06.560]  same thing a year, they need to be able to have 100 million of every single component.
[02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:13.840]  You know, they need to have 100 million, a eight systems on a chip and 100 million of the new,
[02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:19.520]  you know, HD retina displays in two different sizes, etc, etc, every single thing in the box.
[02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:24.320]  But the hardware runs on doesn't run on a yearly cycle, though. That's the thing. They come out
[02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:29.360]  with one every year. But they're in the works for longer than a year, a lot longer than a year,
[02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:34.080]  which is why it's taken them a little bit too longer than the market would dictate to come out
[02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:38.640]  with bigger phones. Because it's, you know, if it takes two years to make a new iPhone,
[02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:44.240]  they didn't get to commit to these phones until about two years ago. Like the iPhone seven or
[02:05:44.240 --> 02:05:47.920]  whatever you want to call it, two years, maybe a bit of a big window. Yeah, but it's more than
[02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:53.360]  a year. Oh, yeah, it's, so maybe it's not quite two years, maybe it's more like, or something,
[02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:59.120]  but, but the team that's doing next year's iPhones is already, you know, long, you know,
[02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:02.400]  they've been at work for, you know, six, seven, eight months, the specs are already out there.
[02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:07.600]  I don't know. I mean, I'm sure you know, but just listen, it's not there. It's kind of funny when
[02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:11.360]  you talk to people who work at Apple, because they have no idea what happened in one release.
[02:06:11.920 --> 02:06:15.520]  No, they literally they're like, Oh, was that in that one? I don't know.
[02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:23.040]  It blurs together more for them. It's like, I was done with that six months, a year before you ever
[02:06:23.040 --> 02:06:28.400]  saw it. So, right. Yeah. Yeah. And that they don't, they don't even know what it's gonna be called.
[02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:33.600]  They have no idea. They honestly don't. Yeah. No. And so that really is what confuses it for
[02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:36.480]  them historically, is that while they were working on stuff, they don't know what it
[02:06:36.480 --> 02:06:41.200]  was going to be called. And so, in hindsight, when they look back, like two, three years,
[02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:45.600]  they don't, they just know it was something. They literally can't remember what product something
[02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:50.640]  shipped in. They have no idea. None. You have to remind them. And they're like, Oh, really?
[02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:56.800]  That's interesting. Yeah. So no, I don't think the annual schedule is off, but I think that they need
[02:06:56.800 --> 02:07:01.520]  to pace themselves better. I don't know. And but again, like I said, maybe the optimistic take is
[02:07:01.520 --> 02:07:07.280]  that iOS eight, because it introduced all this. You think this was an aggressive release followed
[02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:14.960]  that preceded by another guest? Really? Yeah. Yeah. Maybe. That'd be great. Yeah.
[02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:21.600]  I think it's it'll be interesting to see how Yosemite comes out. I've been running the GM.
[02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:27.200]  Same here. I think it's pretty good. But I don't like it. I have some weird aesthetic
[02:07:28.080 --> 02:07:33.280]  choices about it. But yeah, but in terms of like quality, I don't think it's going to be a
[02:07:33.280 --> 02:07:38.720]  problem. Like I always say, no last words. Yeah, exactly. Famous last words, I guess,
[02:07:38.720 --> 02:07:43.760]  but I don't think so. I think because I think that the changes are mostly skin deep.
[02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:49.760]  Yeah. And while I have some issues with it, I don't think you're going to be
[02:07:49.760 --> 02:07:59.360]  writing ethical motion, the last blur pieces. No, no. Like it's, it's weird, but I don't think you
[02:07:59.360 --> 02:08:05.120]  need to, you know, take the knives out of that one. No. And I think it also passes the every
[02:08:05.120 --> 02:08:10.800]  time I go back to Mavericks now, I think it looks really outdated. Yeah. Yeah. And the
[02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:17.120]  hilarious thing is that it brings me back to Windows Vista, which did the blur thing. Right.
[02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:25.120]  Years ago. And whoever did that, if you listening, and you find me, I will buy you lots of beers,
[02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:31.680]  because who did the vista one? Yeah, the vista blur. That sucks for that guy. We all laughed
[02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:38.720]  at him. And now iOS and Mac OS are just totally like, yeah, let's blur everything. All of all of
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:44.080]  the time. Everything is blurry. And that guy is just he's at the, if he's not at the bottom of
[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:49.840]  a glass, he should be. There is I don't want to go too deep. We've already been two hours,
[02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:54.400]  we should wrap it up. And I want to wait until we get to the end of the show.
[02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:59.440]  And I want to wait till Yosemite actually ships before really getting. Yeah. But there is some
[02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:05.520]  weird stuff, though, where the way that Apple's doing it doesn't make any fucking sense. Right.
[02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:09.440]  And I know you're gonna agree with me. The main thing is that you have a translucent sidebar,
[02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:16.000]  the whole sidebar is translucent in whatever. Yeah. It reflects the color of your desktop,
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:20.160]  regardless of how many windows are in between the front window and the desktop.
[02:09:20.160 --> 02:09:25.360]  It's completely random. I don't know. I want to talk to you who did this.
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:30.320]  So like, let's just say you have an orange desktop. I've got a machine here right now with
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:34.320]  with the the carpet from the shiny. But it only does it when the window is the
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:38.480]  front most window. Otherwise, it's completely opaque. Right.
[02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:47.920]  Anyway, yeah, it is. Well, people, people are going to hear my description.
[02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:50.880]  And then they're going to file it away. And again, I think I can't quite be like that.
[02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:54.800]  But then everybody's going to upgrade to Yosemite in a couple of weeks, a week or two.
[02:09:54.800 --> 02:09:58.240]  And then they're gonna go, Oh, my God, Gruber was right. But it's like,
[02:09:58.240 --> 02:10:02.320]  so if you just just imagine you have one window open, that's it. And that's how Apple
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:07.680]  all their screenshots show just one window at a time. This translucent part shows the colors
[02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:12.160]  blurred shows the colors of your underlying desktop picture through. So if you have like
[02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:18.480]  an orange desktop pattern, it's orange blurry. But then if you have windows in between the
[02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:22.640]  front window and the desktop, and they're all white, like, let's just say they're all
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:27.440]  text edit windows, but they're all stacked on top of each other. The sidebar is still orange.
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:29.120]  It's somehow
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:37.760]  right. I can imagine the discussion that led to this where I can imagine a discussion where
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:42.320]  the idea was started, we'll make it, you know, we'll make it see through, we'll make it translucent.
[02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:46.160]  And it was all based on just like one window on the desktop. And then somebody was like,
[02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:48.720]  but what if you have windows in between in the background?
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:54.480]  I love that that's the objection, right? But what if there was more than one window, right?
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:57.360]  And instead of saying where you should start, right?
[02:10:57.360 --> 02:11:01.280]  Right. They would just be like, well, then it would be it'll just be gray. And then and then
[02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:05.120]  somebody was like, well, then that'll be dull. And it will lose that. What's that phrase that
[02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:09.280]  I keep using that it shows the character of your desktop or, you know, in front of your window?
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:10.000]  Right.
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:15.600]  And then somebody said, well, it'll still show your desktop colors right through.
[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:18.800]  And then that's what they made happen.
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:24.560]  I don't understand. There's no logic to it.
[02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:25.060]  Right.
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:30.960]  And maybe that's, you know, maybe that's annoying to people like you and I.
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:34.560]  Right. Because I want to see, I want it to work like, somehow,
[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:37.440]  like, I need to understand it visually and spatially, right?
[02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:42.480]  Yeah, I want there to be rules. I want it to be like a game, but that there are rules. And if
[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:46.320]  this is see through, then it should show whatever's behind it.
[02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:51.120]  I totally agree with you. The rules are completely fucking arbitrary at this point.
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:58.800]  Like, now I'm looking at the programming. Like, restrictions have been placed on this,
[02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:03.840]  that, you know, I can't wrap my head around.
[02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:11.280]  I can guess why the choices were made, but aesthetically, I can't explain it.
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:17.760]  Yeah, I'm not sure. I also, I do feel too, I feel like I'll predict that the other backlash
[02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:26.880]  is going to be that Helvetica as a system font really is pretty choppy on non-retina displays.
[02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:27.840]  Yeah.
[02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:30.880]  And it's, this is the, what you're seeing in Yosemite,
[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:35.760]  I guess there's no name for it really. There's not like a name for the theme anymore. It's not
[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:41.840]  like called anything, but the Yosemite, you know, look and feel the Chrome is, it's forward thinking
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:45.280]  to when all Macs are going to have retina quality displays.
[02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:48.320]  Which I think is reasonable. I mean, and I think you're trying to avoid like,
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:51.760]  Aqua Noe or something, right?
[02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:52.240]  Yeah.
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:54.640]  It's a, it's, it's a different thing.
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:57.520]  Yeah. I think it's the right time. And it's, again, it just, you know, it's like you said
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:01.920]  with the whole compositing system in macOS 10, 10.0, right?
[02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:04.000]  Gotta take your lumps, right? You gotta take your lumps.
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:07.920]  Take your lumps. But then when the hardware catches up, we'll already be ready.
[02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:13.840]  And, you know, I feel like that, I feel like the whole Yosemite look and feel is so clearly
[02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:19.680]  optimized for retina and then made second hand to look as good as possible on non-retina,
[02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:25.680]  as opposed to the other way around where up until now the Mac interface has been non-retina first.
[02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:30.240]  And then it just looks kind of weird on retina. Not that it looks low res, but that it just,
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:32.000]  just are odd decisions.
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:33.360]  Isn't quite suitable. Yeah.
[02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:33.520]  Right.
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:34.400]  No, I totally agree.
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:35.280]  Right.
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:42.480]  And this is, honestly, I am sitting in front of a Mac Pro, more or less the most expensive
[02:13:42.480 --> 02:13:47.280]  computer you could buy from Apple. And I don't have the written screen.
[02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:47.780]  Right.
[02:13:47.780 --> 02:13:52.980]  And I'm kind of bummed out by the, you know, Yosemite look.
[02:13:52.980 --> 02:13:53.940]  Yeah.
[02:13:53.940 --> 02:13:59.380]  One day, hopefully soon, I'll be able to upgrade. But no, I totally agree with you that the,
[02:14:00.340 --> 02:14:06.180]  I think it's fine. I think every now and then there's going to be a jump and something is
[02:14:06.180 --> 02:14:13.060]  going to be degraded. And, you know, to bring it back to the Fireball piece that we talked
[02:14:13.060 --> 02:14:20.500]  about previously, and techno 2034, every now and then you take it, you take your lumps,
[02:14:20.500 --> 02:14:28.020]  you take a step back and it lets you sort of move into the future a little bit more.
[02:14:28.020 --> 02:14:30.660]  And I think Yosemite is one of those kinds of releases.
[02:14:31.460 --> 02:14:36.260]  Yeah, I agree. Yeah. I'll have to link, I'll put it in the show notes. I'll link up that.
[02:14:36.260 --> 02:14:41.540]  You really should. You know what? It's a great article. And I disagree with like 90% of this.
[02:14:41.540 --> 02:14:48.180]  Well, because I mean, it's easy to say now. And I did it, I did at the time, but I can't prove it.
[02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:53.940]  But like a lot of this is like provably wrong, right? Or at least history didn't bear you out.
[02:14:54.980 --> 02:15:00.500]  But this is, I kept reading you. And this is one of the reasons why I'm like, this is,
[02:15:00.500 --> 02:15:05.220]  this is a very smart piece. Very well considered. I disagree with the conclusions.
[02:15:06.100 --> 02:15:08.900]  A lot of it though, is our stuff that could never really be settled.
[02:15:08.900 --> 02:15:15.220]  Yeah, I know. The file name extensions, file name extensions is perfect. And the file paths is
[02:15:15.220 --> 02:15:20.740]  another one. The file pass thing was just stupid. I could, I could do another show about all of this.
[02:15:20.740 --> 02:15:25.860]  Yes. Yeah. I remember at some point, I mean, we had, we had software updaters in the 90s
[02:15:25.860 --> 02:15:29.860]  for the classic Mac OS that no matter where you put the application on your hard disk,
[02:15:29.860 --> 02:15:35.700]  if you ran the updater, it would find it because it would find the app by an identifier and then
[02:15:35.700 --> 02:15:39.620]  update the app to the latest version. So you didn't have to put it in a special folder.
[02:15:39.620 --> 02:15:44.580]  And then I remember, I forget which app it was, if it was iPhoto or one of the, like iTunes or
[02:15:44.580 --> 02:15:51.300]  iPhoto. But the next guys wrote an updater in like 2002 or 2003 or so.
[02:15:51.300 --> 02:15:56.900]  So do you know what? It's the very next article. It's the very next article in Daring Fireball
[02:15:56.900 --> 02:16:04.260]  called Finding Abby. You had, you had your knives out for, I don't know why, but you did.
[02:16:04.260 --> 02:16:12.420]  Yeah. You'd run the iTunes updater and it would nuke your whole hard drive.
[02:16:13.380 --> 02:16:16.660]  If you would, if you would like rename your hard disk.
[02:16:16.660 --> 02:16:21.460]  If you'd done anything clever at all, it would nuke your hard drive, which is awesome.
[02:16:21.460 --> 02:16:23.780]  Because it was making assumptions about the paths.
[02:16:23.780 --> 02:16:25.540]  Yeah. Oh, totally. It was awful.
[02:16:25.540 --> 02:16:26.260]  There were rough times.
[02:16:26.260 --> 02:16:35.060]  Do you know what though? I'm going to try to address this obliquely. A friend of ours who
[02:16:35.060 --> 02:16:41.940]  went on to manage iMessage, Game Center and all of that kind of stuff. Do you know the
[02:16:41.940 --> 02:16:42.660]  guy I'm talking about?
[02:16:42.660 --> 02:16:43.540]  Yeah, I know exactly.
[02:16:43.540 --> 02:16:49.220]  Okay. So apparently I, my belief is one of his first gigs was like,
[02:16:49.220 --> 02:16:56.820]  they can't, the guy that wrote that installer and his thing was to fix it.
[02:16:58.820 --> 02:17:00.100]  That's kind of funny.
[02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:00.980]  It's great, right?
[02:17:03.220 --> 02:17:04.260]  I feel bad.
[02:17:04.260 --> 02:17:08.260]  I know. I feel bad. I don't want to be, I mean, mistakes happen. I really,
[02:17:08.260 --> 02:17:12.660]  I'm not laughing at the guy. I'm just laughing at the circumstance. Like, shit happens.
[02:17:13.220 --> 02:17:16.260]  You know what? I was like, the way that you say I really had it out for,
[02:17:16.260 --> 02:17:17.860]  for Abby Tevainian back then.
[02:17:17.860 --> 02:17:19.540]  I don't know what you did. I really don't.
[02:17:19.540 --> 02:17:25.300]  I don't know either. In hindsight, I feel a little, it was immature, even though I was in
[02:17:25.300 --> 02:17:25.860]  my thirties.
[02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:31.700]  Yeah, but it's like two in a row that you're like, fuck this Abigail. He's an awesome dude.
[02:17:31.700 --> 02:17:33.940]  He's done like a lot of great stuff, right?
[02:17:33.940 --> 02:17:37.300]  Yeah. And in hindsight, you know, it was, you know, helped turn Apple around, you know?
[02:17:37.300 --> 02:17:37.780]  Yeah.
[02:17:37.780 --> 02:17:42.100]  And you know what? And I even, I even acknowledge in the article, even acknowledge in the article
[02:17:42.100 --> 02:17:47.460]  that the classic Mac OS updates post next reunification.
[02:17:47.460 --> 02:17:48.260]  For him.
[02:17:48.260 --> 02:17:49.940]  And they were outstanding.
[02:17:49.940 --> 02:17:53.940]  Like, so it was eight to nine for whatever.
[02:17:53.940 --> 02:17:58.260]  Yeah. But especially, especially eight point, I think eight, eight, oh, and eight, one,
[02:17:58.260 --> 02:17:59.860]  I think eight point five was,
[02:17:59.860 --> 02:18:06.180]  Oh, okay. Maybe eight, one, eight point five was big. Cause I think it put quick draw on
[02:18:06.180 --> 02:18:06.900]  power PC.
[02:18:07.460 --> 02:18:07.960]  Yeah.
[02:18:09.700 --> 02:18:14.980]  I'm definitely iffy with my classic Mac OS history, but there was a lot of good work
[02:18:14.980 --> 02:18:17.860]  down there, like a lot and it was all under him.
[02:18:18.500 --> 02:18:18.740]  Yeah.
[02:18:18.740 --> 02:18:20.660]  And then you just come up.
[02:18:21.300 --> 02:18:22.420]  But I acknowledge that though.
[02:18:22.420 --> 02:18:26.100]  But they did, but I don't understand what the animosity was.
[02:18:27.220 --> 02:18:30.660]  Well, you know, file extensions.
[02:18:34.260 --> 02:18:37.940]  Was it like a, just a narrative device or, which is cool.
[02:18:37.940 --> 02:18:44.580]  Uh, I don't know. I was a little bit and I was a little bit more, um, less hesitant
[02:18:45.220 --> 02:18:49.380]  to go a little over the top, you know, to, to fill the glass.
[02:18:51.780 --> 02:18:56.100]  Because I didn't have a big audience. It was a, I was a very small audience. I didn't like,
[02:18:56.100 --> 02:19:00.740]  I would never have expected that he'd, he'd read what I wrote and maybe he did. I don't
[02:19:00.740 --> 02:19:03.860]  know. But I, you know, whereas now today, I know that if I wrote something like that,
[02:19:03.860 --> 02:19:07.780]  that whoever it is with Apple would read it. And not that I'm afraid to write anything
[02:19:07.780 --> 02:19:10.900]  critical of someone at Apple, but it would be more measured, right?
[02:19:11.940 --> 02:19:16.100]  Yeah. I want to have my ducks in a row and make sure that it is, it is not over the top.
[02:19:16.100 --> 02:19:18.980]  I want it to be at the exact right level of.
[02:19:19.860 --> 02:19:23.220]  Yeah. These, these two posts to me are literally fireballs.
[02:19:24.020 --> 02:19:24.340]  Yeah.
[02:19:24.340 --> 02:19:29.380]  Which is not to say that you don't love them now. And I don't mean to take that away from
[02:19:29.380 --> 02:19:36.020]  me, but this is just, it's like a bit more headstrong than I think you would be now.
[02:19:36.020 --> 02:19:39.620]  I think you'd be more measured and it's like, right?
[02:19:39.620 --> 02:19:44.340]  It's like my, my use of the word jackass where I was, I used to be freer with it.
[02:19:44.340 --> 02:19:45.060]  Yeah.
[02:19:45.060 --> 02:19:48.580]  And I, I don't think I ever once used it. Maybe there's one time where I regretted it
[02:19:48.580 --> 02:19:49.300]  a little bit, but.
[02:19:49.860 --> 02:19:52.260]  I miss those jackass of the week was funny.
[02:19:52.260 --> 02:19:56.500]  It was funny, but it was usually people being jackasses, but it got to the point where I
[02:19:56.500 --> 02:20:01.140]  realized though that a lot of people who I would call jackass of the week, when you Googled them,
[02:20:01.140 --> 02:20:03.700]  the first hit was me calling them a jackass.
[02:20:03.700 --> 02:20:06.020]  That's horrible. You don't mean that.
[02:20:06.020 --> 02:20:10.660]  I don't, but I did mean no, but I always meant though, that when I said someone was being
[02:20:10.660 --> 02:20:15.220]  a jackass, that they were literally being a jackass. They were being willfully ignorant
[02:20:15.220 --> 02:20:16.660]  or deceitful.
[02:20:17.220 --> 02:20:20.980]  This particular choice is bad. It doesn't mean that they're, you don't want to type
[02:20:20.980 --> 02:20:24.660]  their name into Google and come up with like, Oh, they were a jackass like that.
[02:20:24.660 --> 02:20:28.260]  I use it way less frequently now though, because I know that I've, you know, during
[02:20:28.260 --> 02:20:30.740]  fireball is more widely read and more influential.
[02:20:30.740 --> 02:20:33.380]  But I noticed that that was a conscious decision though, right?
[02:20:33.380 --> 02:20:34.260]  Right. Right.
[02:20:34.260 --> 02:20:38.180]  And it's the same way where if my criticism of like an Apple executive or something like
[02:20:38.180 --> 02:20:45.540]  that is, um, I try, I try to be more measured now, but without being, um, you know, I don't
[02:20:45.540 --> 02:20:47.700]  want to be dull and I don't hold back.
[02:20:47.700 --> 02:20:48.820]  No, no, no.
[02:20:48.820 --> 02:20:51.780]  I guess that's the best way I can put it is I don't want to go over the top. I want
[02:20:51.780 --> 02:20:55.460]  to get right to the top. I want to make sure it's accurate. Whereas in the early days,
[02:20:55.460 --> 02:20:59.540]  I would felt free to go over the top because I didn't feel that there were any repercussions
[02:20:59.540 --> 02:21:00.260]  from it.
[02:21:00.260 --> 02:21:08.260]  Yeah. And I, I don't mean to be blog critic, but so the second piece about Avi immediately
[02:21:08.260 --> 02:21:13.300]  after the other one, finding Avi literally starts with a handful of readers emailed to
[02:21:13.300 --> 02:21:18.740]  complain about Monday's mixed review of Avi Torbenian's legacy at Apple's vice president
[02:21:18.740 --> 02:21:20.100]  of software engineering.
[02:21:21.540 --> 02:21:29.540]  And you addressed it head on, which is one of the reasons I'm like, man, if I can totally
[02:21:29.540 --> 02:21:33.140]  disagree with this guy, but good work, you know?
[02:21:35.540 --> 02:21:37.940]  Boy, those articles are way down in the archives.
[02:21:37.940 --> 02:21:41.140]  Yeah. They're way back and it's totally unfair to hold them to you.
[02:21:41.700 --> 02:21:44.260]  I will link them up. All right, we should end the show, but I will put them in the show
[02:21:44.260 --> 02:21:47.380]  notes or at least I'll put one in the show notes and then you get, if anybody wants to
[02:21:47.380 --> 02:21:51.620]  read them, you can keep reading next previous article to, uh, yeah.
[02:21:53.140 --> 02:21:55.860]  What was the, what was the time? 2003?
[02:21:55.860 --> 02:21:57.700]  Yeah. It was like a long time ago.
[02:21:57.700 --> 02:21:59.940]  Well, I can just search for his name.
[02:21:59.940 --> 02:22:00.180]  Yeah.
[02:22:00.740 --> 02:22:01.620]  Audios Avi.
[02:22:02.260 --> 02:22:04.100]  Fine. Thank you. Such a dick.
[02:22:05.540 --> 02:22:06.180]  It was awesome.
[02:22:07.780 --> 02:22:12.900]  So this is very oblique and probably pretty inside baseball.
[02:22:13.940 --> 02:22:20.980]  Uh, I loved that Ben flip-flopped his opinion on the, on the watch introduction.
[02:22:21.780 --> 02:22:23.060]  I thought that, I thought that was great.
[02:22:23.620 --> 02:22:24.340]  I really did.
[02:22:24.340 --> 02:22:30.260]  And it, and it speaks, I mean, I, I'm only bringing up because I've read these articles
[02:22:30.260 --> 02:22:33.700]  back in the day and I was like, ah, I disagree with a lot of this.
[02:22:33.700 --> 02:22:41.860]  And I, sometimes I read Ben's pieces and I'm like, kind of disagree, but so well thought
[02:22:41.860 --> 02:22:45.860]  out, like good, you know, smart guy, very, very smart guy.
[02:22:47.060 --> 02:22:51.700]  Yeah. No, it reminds me of the thing I just like two weeks ago, linked to a Jason Fried
[02:22:51.700 --> 02:22:57.700]  piece where he, uh, you know, that, uh, Bezos was addressing 30, well, it's not the base
[02:22:57.700 --> 02:23:02.500]  camp now, not 37 signals, but came in and did like a Q and a, and he's, you know, I'm
[02:23:02.500 --> 02:23:05.620]  sure he's not the first person to say it, but here's how you can be right most of the
[02:23:05.620 --> 02:23:07.140]  time, be willing to change your mind.
[02:23:07.140 --> 02:23:07.860]  Yeah. I love that.
[02:23:08.740 --> 02:23:10.980]  You know, because you'll be wrong and then you'll change your mind.
[02:23:10.980 --> 02:23:12.820]  And then it, it's just funny.
[02:23:12.820 --> 02:23:18.180]  And Ben, Ben did that with a watch where Ben, you know, had a sort of almost scathing initial
[02:23:18.180 --> 02:23:22.340]  take on it and then within a week had talked to himself into being one of the biggest proponents
[02:23:22.340 --> 02:23:22.820]  out there.
[02:23:22.820 --> 02:23:23.320]  Right.
[02:23:23.700 --> 02:23:31.380]  Um, uh, and there was a similar thing with Steve Jobs and Tim Cook and, you know, came
[02:23:31.380 --> 02:23:36.660]  out after Steve died, but like Tim's first, you know, D whatever conference, you know,
[02:23:36.660 --> 02:23:40.980]  he said he was, he was the world's biggest flip flopper and waffler in the world, but
[02:23:40.980 --> 02:23:44.180]  that's what made him great was one day he'd tell you, this is a terrible idea.
[02:23:44.180 --> 02:23:44.660]  It's awful.
[02:23:44.660 --> 02:23:46.900]  And then he'd come in the next day and say, I have a great idea.
[02:23:46.900 --> 02:23:53.300]  And it was your idea that, you know, that his refuse, you know, that he was open to
[02:23:53.300 --> 02:23:56.580]  anything, you know, we're never going to make an iTunes for windows.
[02:23:56.580 --> 02:23:56.900]  Okay.
[02:23:56.900 --> 02:23:58.100]  We'll make iTunes for windows.
[02:23:58.100 --> 02:24:03.620]  And then, you know, I, you know, iPod from windows becomes, you know, a huge hit, um,
[02:24:04.500 --> 02:24:05.620]  over and over and over again.
[02:24:05.620 --> 02:24:09.220]  And then, you know, it just comes up with people who, you know, have quotes of Steve
[02:24:09.220 --> 02:24:13.940]  Jobs saying that, you know, eight inch tablets are a terrible idea or, you know, big, nobody's
[02:24:13.940 --> 02:24:15.460]  ever going to buy a big phone.
[02:24:15.460 --> 02:24:18.660]  That it's proof that Apple is doing things they wouldn't have done under Steve Jobs.
[02:24:18.660 --> 02:24:21.460]  No, I mean, it's, you know, the market changes, you know?
[02:24:21.460 --> 02:24:23.300]  No, it's well, it's not even market.
[02:24:23.300 --> 02:24:25.940]  I mean, good lines change.
[02:24:25.940 --> 02:24:27.380]  Yeah, I, uh, exactly.
[02:24:27.380 --> 02:24:28.980]  And that's a great way of putting it.
[02:24:28.980 --> 02:24:36.660]  Uh, I think there is a huge, I think it is an error to canonize Steve Jobs.
[02:24:38.100 --> 02:24:39.140]  Brilliant guy.
[02:24:39.140 --> 02:24:44.180]  I don't want to take that away from him, but, uh, you know, his is not the would have
[02:24:44.180 --> 02:24:46.580]  God, like it's not set in stone.
[02:24:46.580 --> 02:24:51.380]  Well, it's that word, the, the word from the, you know, again, not to get, bring too
[02:24:51.380 --> 02:24:55.140]  much actual religion into it, but with the Catholic church infallibility.
[02:24:55.140 --> 02:24:55.460]  Right.
[02:24:55.460 --> 02:24:55.860]  Exactly.
[02:24:55.860 --> 02:24:56.020]  Yeah.
[02:24:58.340 --> 02:24:58.740]  Right.
[02:24:58.740 --> 02:25:05.060]  The Pope is held as infallible and, you know, it's, it's a real problem because, you know,
[02:25:05.060 --> 02:25:08.740]  human beings aren't actually infallible, but they, you know, but there's a tendency
[02:25:08.740 --> 02:25:09.940]  among many to view.
[02:25:09.940 --> 02:25:12.740]  And it's funny because it comes from both sides though.
[02:25:12.740 --> 02:25:19.380]  It also comes from like, even like the diehard Android types who say, I thought Steve Jobs
[02:25:19.380 --> 02:25:20.260]  was infallible.
[02:25:20.260 --> 02:25:24.420]  And he said, nobody would buy a five inch phone, nitpicking effectively, which is like,
[02:25:24.420 --> 02:25:25.060]  right.
[02:25:25.060 --> 02:25:29.860]  And you know, and it's also combined with the fact that what's true in 2011 is not true
[02:25:29.860 --> 02:25:30.740]  in 2014.
[02:25:31.300 --> 02:25:31.620]  Right.
[02:25:31.620 --> 02:25:37.540]  So I mean, I believe this is in your Twitter stream somewhere.
[02:25:37.540 --> 02:25:46.180]  Uh, you know, there was a guy telling Neetan Ganatra that Apple doesn't behave in a certain
[02:25:46.180 --> 02:25:46.500]  way.
[02:25:46.500 --> 02:25:52.900]  And, you know, Neetan van the iOS, he was the director of iOS apps.
[02:25:52.900 --> 02:26:01.300]  Uh, and I think that there's a projected view of the way that Apple does and does not
[02:26:01.300 --> 02:26:11.860]  operate and, and, uh, where it will innovate and where it will just, um, I don't mean just,
[02:26:11.860 --> 02:26:20.260]  but where it adopts the common, uh, you know, implementation, the, the, the, the, for lack
[02:26:20.260 --> 02:26:22.660]  of a better word, the compatibility option.
[02:26:22.660 --> 02:26:22.900]  Right.
[02:26:23.780 --> 02:26:28.420]  And I think, you know, with the file, like, you know, the file extensions and the credit
[02:26:28.420 --> 02:26:35.540]  codes and all of that, uh, I think Apple did cave from something that might have been better,
[02:26:35.540 --> 02:26:40.820]  but they caved in order to achieve, uh, compatibility.
[02:26:42.260 --> 02:26:47.220]  And I noticed that you put that in quotes in one of your tweets, but, but a compatibility
[02:26:47.220 --> 02:26:49.140]  with a broader computing world.
[02:26:49.140 --> 02:26:56.900]  And they did so in order to achieve, um, the ability to communicate with the outside world
[02:26:56.900 --> 02:27:00.820]  better, which I think was a smart choice given the time, right?
[02:27:00.820 --> 02:27:04.500]  Like communicating was just about to become essential.
[02:27:07.220 --> 02:27:09.460]  I agree with that to some degree.
[02:27:09.460 --> 02:27:12.980]  I would at least say that there's a, it wasn't an unreasonable.
[02:27:12.980 --> 02:27:15.060]  The other side of the argument wasn't unreasonable.
[02:27:15.620 --> 02:27:16.420]  No, I don't think so.
[02:27:16.420 --> 02:27:21.060]  Which is why I read you in Syracuse and it was different sets of trade-offs and what
[02:27:21.060 --> 02:27:22.020]  do you value more?
[02:27:22.020 --> 02:27:26.580]  And I just, you know, uh, you know, and again, you might be right though, that in the long
[02:27:26.580 --> 02:27:29.140]  run, it worked out better going with those decisions then.
[02:27:29.860 --> 02:27:35.860]  And you know, one of the reasons why is that ultimately we resulted with iOS where the
[02:27:35.860 --> 02:27:37.460]  actual file system is hidden.
[02:27:38.100 --> 02:27:38.420]  Right.
[02:27:38.420 --> 02:27:41.620]  Which I think Neaton is, is a big proponent of.
[02:27:41.620 --> 02:27:42.260]  Yeah.
[02:27:42.260 --> 02:27:48.740]  That that's fine to me because then it doesn't matter if under the hood, it's a case-sensitive
[02:27:48.740 --> 02:27:51.220]  file system with file extensions, which I think it still is.
[02:27:51.220 --> 02:27:52.980]  I know it was for a while it was case sensitive.
[02:27:52.980 --> 02:27:54.420]  Yeah, it's still case sensitive.
[02:27:54.420 --> 02:27:56.420]  Um, which is fine.
[02:27:56.420 --> 02:27:59.940]  I would argue against that vehemently if they ever did that with the Mac where the file
[02:27:59.940 --> 02:28:00.980]  system matters.
[02:28:00.980 --> 02:28:04.580]  Um, well, that's cause it's exposed to you, but right.
[02:28:04.580 --> 02:28:06.180]  And to usual users, right?
[02:28:06.180 --> 02:28:10.900]  Like, you know, I can conceive of a Mac 10 years from now, or maybe even less, maybe
[02:28:10.900 --> 02:28:16.020]  five years from now where it's the file system is only for people who've installed Xcode.
[02:28:16.020 --> 02:28:16.340]  Right.
[02:28:16.340 --> 02:28:21.780]  So I have a difference between the presentation versus the representation, right?
[02:28:21.780 --> 02:28:26.820]  Where the presentation is what you see as a user and the representations, why X is actually
[02:28:26.820 --> 02:28:27.620]  happening on disc.
[02:28:28.260 --> 02:28:35.860]  And I think file systems in a lot of ways have often favored exposing a representation
[02:28:35.860 --> 02:28:44.820]  of exactly what's happening rather than, you know, uh, projecting a view that, that, that
[02:28:44.820 --> 02:28:46.260]  is more useful to the user.
[02:28:46.740 --> 02:28:46.900]  Right.
[02:28:46.900 --> 02:28:52.420]  I, in my analogy, I'm file system or file name extensions as, as a user exposed feature
[02:28:52.420 --> 02:28:55.460]  has always been that, um, they're bullshit.
[02:28:55.460 --> 02:28:56.500]  It's awful.
[02:28:56.500 --> 02:29:03.060]  It's two pieces of data mixed in this one in one field separated by an orbit, just a
[02:29:03.060 --> 02:29:06.100]  piece of a piece of text, just a, just a dot.
[02:29:06.100 --> 02:29:08.820]  Well, there's a, there's a turd sitting there between the two.
[02:29:08.820 --> 02:29:09.220]  Right.
[02:29:09.220 --> 02:29:14.500]  And so it's easily, you know, it's easily, it is easily changed, you know, if you want
[02:29:14.500 --> 02:29:18.980]  to, but it, you know, I can't tell you how many times I've talked to people who thought
[02:29:18.980 --> 02:29:24.260]  that the way you convert a ping to a JPEG is to erase the PNG and type JPG.
[02:29:24.260 --> 02:29:24.820]  Do you know what?
[02:29:24.820 --> 02:29:26.420]  That should actually work.
[02:29:26.420 --> 02:29:27.460]  It should in theory.
[02:29:27.460 --> 02:29:28.740]  That would be amazing if it worked.
[02:29:28.740 --> 02:29:31.860]  I could see, you know, the finder should do that.
[02:29:31.860 --> 02:29:32.660]  That should work.
[02:29:32.660 --> 02:29:34.820]  It's, it should say, I noticed you did that.
[02:29:34.820 --> 02:29:36.660]  Would you like me to change this to a JPEG?
[02:29:36.660 --> 02:29:37.540]  That would be amazing.
[02:29:38.100 --> 02:29:39.620]  Um, but guess what?
[02:29:39.620 --> 02:29:41.620]  That doesn't actually happen and it didn't happen there.
[02:29:41.620 --> 02:29:45.060]  Um, but people, I can see why norm to a normal person, it should work.
[02:29:45.060 --> 02:29:45.620]  Right.
[02:29:45.620 --> 02:29:49.940]  Um, and to me, it's just like, well, why not put the creation and modification date in
[02:29:49.940 --> 02:29:50.580]  there too?
[02:29:50.580 --> 02:29:54.980]  And then you have to have a date and a name and a file extension all in one field.
[02:29:54.980 --> 02:29:56.100]  You just being a jackass.
[02:29:56.660 --> 02:29:58.180]  No, it's the exact same.
[02:29:58.180 --> 02:30:00.020]  It's the, it's okay.
[02:30:00.020 --> 02:30:01.300]  I understand the file system.
[02:30:01.300 --> 02:30:02.260]  Same thing.
[02:30:02.260 --> 02:30:06.900]  The file system has always had a field for the creation date and the modification date.
[02:30:06.900 --> 02:30:10.660]  And that's different from the name and that it never had, it never had a field for the
[02:30:10.660 --> 02:30:10.980]  type.
[02:30:10.980 --> 02:30:14.420]  So, and it should have, I mean, I mean, do you want to go over the history of this?
[02:30:14.420 --> 02:30:19.220]  Cause no, but I'm just saying that two pieces of data in the same field is, is a clue.
[02:30:19.220 --> 02:30:21.140]  So I, and the Mac didn't suffer from that.
[02:30:21.140 --> 02:30:25.540]  The Mac had something that was more graceful and it wasn't built for the future and it
[02:30:25.540 --> 02:30:27.940]  wasn't built for compatibility with anybody else.
[02:30:27.940 --> 02:30:28.180]  Right.
[02:30:28.180 --> 02:30:32.100]  But they should have only replaced it with something that was better, not with something
[02:30:32.100 --> 02:30:34.180]  that was more primitive.
[02:30:34.180 --> 02:30:42.500]  I think file name extensions were, used to be able to name a file and whatever type it
[02:30:42.500 --> 02:30:43.940]  was, didn't matter.
[02:30:44.740 --> 02:30:47.460]  It was assumed that you'd be able to feed it into the correct app.
[02:30:48.180 --> 02:30:51.860]  This is before GUIs, you know, the old school stuff, right?
[02:30:55.060 --> 02:31:01.700]  When it became apparent that we would have file formats that would work in not just one
[02:31:01.700 --> 02:31:08.100]  application, but in multiple applications, extensions were born, right?
[02:31:08.100 --> 02:31:13.060]  And the way that that got addressed was just being literally appended to the end of the
[02:31:13.060 --> 02:31:13.620]  file name.
[02:31:14.820 --> 02:31:18.580]  It's the most pragmatic workman-like thing you can do.
[02:31:20.020 --> 02:31:27.780]  And it was so obvious and so basic that I think pretty much universally, it was, it
[02:31:27.780 --> 02:31:28.500]  was adopted.
[02:31:28.500 --> 02:31:36.420]  Uh, the Mac tried to throw it off and I think ultimately it failed because it didn't, it
[02:31:36.420 --> 02:31:40.900]  didn't command the market share that could, that could really make it happen.
[02:31:40.900 --> 02:31:41.540]  You know what I mean?
[02:31:42.100 --> 02:31:44.980]  No, but it wasn't really, it wasn't a problem for Mac users though.
[02:31:44.980 --> 02:31:50.420]  Like, so when you download, in the old days, when you would download a GIF file and on
[02:31:50.420 --> 02:31:55.140]  the server that it was coming from, it didn't have any, you know, uh, type code because
[02:31:55.140 --> 02:31:56.340]  it wasn't a Mac server.
[02:31:56.340 --> 02:31:57.540]  It would just come down.
[02:31:57.540 --> 02:32:01.860]  Whatever software you downloaded with would look at the file extension and just put the
[02:32:01.860 --> 02:32:05.300]  right creator code on or not creator code type code.
[02:32:05.300 --> 02:32:10.340]  It would look at the file extension or would it look at the mime type given by the mime
[02:32:10.340 --> 02:32:10.580]  type?
[02:32:10.580 --> 02:32:11.860]  Yeah, probably the mime type.
[02:32:11.860 --> 02:32:16.740]  Um, uh, and all the, all the browsers did it, all the FTP clients did it.
[02:32:16.740 --> 02:32:20.980]  It was, it wasn't as, as much of a problem as you would think it was.
[02:32:20.980 --> 02:32:22.420]  It was, it was not an issue.
[02:32:22.420 --> 02:32:28.900]  No, no, no, I'm saying this is why that the file name extension thing exists and why I
[02:32:28.900 --> 02:32:32.100]  think you can explain it to anybody and anybody would get it.
[02:32:32.100 --> 02:32:37.300]  Yeah, but I just, I, in hindsight to me, it was, it, the big thing isn't which side was
[02:32:37.300 --> 02:32:37.620]  right.
[02:32:37.620 --> 02:32:42.740]  It's that everybody was wrong because giving users access to the file system was wrong
[02:32:42.740 --> 02:32:43.780]  in the first place.
[02:32:43.780 --> 02:32:45.620]  I give you 100%.
[02:32:45.620 --> 02:32:46.100]  Yeah.
[02:32:46.100 --> 02:32:46.340]  Right.
[02:32:46.340 --> 02:32:51.380]  And it was what level of technical ability are you expecting the people who do have access
[02:32:51.380 --> 02:32:52.980]  to the file system to have?
[02:32:52.980 --> 02:32:53.860]  Well, so wait.
[02:32:53.860 --> 02:33:01.620]  So wait, I agree with you, but I don't think it was wrong so much as a necessity at the
[02:33:01.620 --> 02:33:01.860]  time.
[02:33:03.060 --> 02:33:06.260]  I mean, the first Mac ships you've got what?
[02:33:06.260 --> 02:33:07.060]  What was it?
[02:33:07.060 --> 02:33:08.340]  640K?
[02:33:09.700 --> 02:33:10.980]  No, more than that.
[02:33:10.980 --> 02:33:13.220]  Or no, it was 128K.
[02:33:13.220 --> 02:33:13.860]  128.
[02:33:14.580 --> 02:33:14.900]  Yeah.
[02:33:14.900 --> 02:33:15.460]  Okay.
[02:33:15.460 --> 02:33:24.900]  So whatever it was, you didn't have the resources in order to abstract a storage system away,
[02:33:24.900 --> 02:33:25.220]  right?
[02:33:25.220 --> 02:33:27.220]  And I'm sure that was not even on their minds.
[02:33:28.100 --> 02:33:29.700]  I can't believe this is what we're arguing about.
[02:33:30.260 --> 02:33:31.620]  I don't know if we're arguing.
[02:33:31.620 --> 02:33:32.260]  No, not really.
[02:33:32.260 --> 02:33:33.780]  But here's another factor too.
[02:33:33.780 --> 02:33:36.980]  So the Techno 2034 said use file extensions.
[02:33:38.020 --> 02:33:38.260]  Yeah.
[02:33:38.820 --> 02:33:42.340]  And I think it said use it instead of type and crater code.
[02:33:42.340 --> 02:33:43.060]  I'm not sure.
[02:33:43.060 --> 02:33:43.940]  Yeah, it was.
[02:33:43.940 --> 02:33:50.020]  But the problem that it ran into is that it broke the way millions of actual Mac users
[02:33:50.020 --> 02:33:54.500]  were using their Macs and Mac users did things they did.
[02:33:54.500 --> 02:33:55.700]  No, it's adorable.
[02:33:55.700 --> 02:33:56.340]  Millions.
[02:33:56.340 --> 02:33:58.340]  That's how many sell in a quarter these days.
[02:33:58.980 --> 02:33:59.700]  Oh, I know.
[02:33:59.700 --> 02:34:00.900]  It's a very small number.
[02:34:00.900 --> 02:34:02.980]  I mean, it was for a long, long time.
[02:34:02.980 --> 02:34:07.700]  The estimated user base of active Mac users hovered.
[02:34:07.700 --> 02:34:11.780]  And that's dangerous when it hovers instead of grows at about 20 million.
[02:34:11.780 --> 02:34:12.020]  Yeah.
[02:34:12.020 --> 02:34:16.260]  I don't, I'm going to guess that you do that in a quarter or two these days.
[02:34:16.260 --> 02:34:16.740]  Like that.
[02:34:16.740 --> 02:34:17.060]  Yeah.
[02:34:17.060 --> 02:34:20.580]  Well, yeah, it's like four to 5 million a quarter, I think.
[02:34:20.580 --> 02:34:20.820]  Yeah.
[02:34:20.820 --> 02:34:21.700]  So, so, okay.
[02:34:21.700 --> 02:34:25.860]  So maybe a year you'll anyway, who knows who knows how many are.
[02:34:25.860 --> 02:34:26.020]  Yeah.
[02:34:27.620 --> 02:34:32.660]  But the idea, but the hand wringing over that, that person, whatever.
[02:34:32.660 --> 02:34:38.100]  I'll let you people as a graphic designer, as an artist, you assume that you could have
[02:34:38.100 --> 02:34:41.620]  files with the same extension that would open when you double click them would open in
[02:34:41.620 --> 02:34:45.460]  different apps, you know, that the ones you created in Photoshop would open in Photoshop
[02:34:45.460 --> 02:34:50.980]  and the ones you created in, I don't know, de-babilizer would open in de-babilizer.
[02:34:50.980 --> 02:34:52.180]  I think that's a great feature.
[02:34:52.180 --> 02:34:56.740]  I think it's a missed feature when you send that file of the network and somebody tries
[02:34:56.740 --> 02:35:01.780]  to click it and you're told that like, you don't have that app.
[02:35:01.780 --> 02:35:02.820]  I'm like, I don't care.
[02:35:02.820 --> 02:35:04.740]  I want to open my app, right?
[02:35:05.460 --> 02:35:10.980]  Yeah, I totally agree with that where it did make some problems like that, but it was just
[02:35:10.980 --> 02:35:12.020]  again, it's trade-offs.
[02:35:12.020 --> 02:35:13.140]  Is it better for me?
[02:35:13.140 --> 02:35:16.420]  Is it better for me to be able to have all my files open right in the app I made them
[02:35:16.420 --> 02:35:16.660]  with?
[02:35:16.660 --> 02:35:19.620]  Or is it better for you when I give them to you that they have the right code?
[02:35:19.620 --> 02:35:19.780]  Right.
[02:35:19.780 --> 02:35:23.140]  I feel like we could hit a middle grant where it's like, if you strip off the creative code
[02:35:23.140 --> 02:35:30.740]  during transmit, panic plug, uh, transmission, like copying to another computer, it'd be
[02:35:30.740 --> 02:35:31.220]  fine.
[02:35:31.220 --> 02:35:31.700]  It's not.
[02:35:31.700 --> 02:35:35.140]  And you'd get a new one based on your preferences when it can be the default.
[02:35:35.140 --> 02:35:38.340]  There'd be no creative code, whatever the main point is, zoom back out.
[02:35:38.340 --> 02:35:41.620]  The main point though, is that none of these people, none of the graphic design workflows
[02:35:41.620 --> 02:35:45.300]  should not have been built around direct access to the computer file system.
[02:35:45.300 --> 02:35:48.740]  You know, there should have been something a little bit more abstracted and the way iOS
[02:35:48.740 --> 02:35:51.700]  has gone is ideal and it makes everybody happy.
[02:35:51.700 --> 02:35:52.420]  I think so.
[02:35:52.420 --> 02:35:53.060]  I agree.
[02:35:53.060 --> 02:35:56.260]  I mean, it's literally a fresh reboot, right?
[02:35:56.260 --> 02:35:59.300]  And, uh, you know, there's been missteps.
[02:35:59.860 --> 02:36:00.340]  Yeah.
[02:36:00.340 --> 02:36:01.540]  Well, and it's taken a while to get there.
[02:36:01.540 --> 02:36:05.460]  Like, and that's, you know, the whole iOS document picking thing, which is what everybody
[02:36:05.460 --> 02:36:06.180]  brings up is up.
[02:36:06.180 --> 02:36:07.380]  Now we're back with a file system.
[02:36:07.380 --> 02:36:08.500]  It's not the file system.
[02:36:08.500 --> 02:36:09.860]  It's a file system.
[02:36:09.860 --> 02:36:11.140]  Like, what did you call it?
[02:36:11.140 --> 02:36:12.020]  Projection.
[02:36:12.020 --> 02:36:12.820]  Projection.
[02:36:12.820 --> 02:36:20.100]  And I actually, I don't pat myself on the back that often, but I really think that projection
[02:36:20.100 --> 02:36:22.420]  is the right way to think about this kind of stuff like that.
[02:36:23.300 --> 02:36:26.420]  Uh, iCloud drive on Yosemite does it.
[02:36:27.220 --> 02:36:31.460]  I think that this is not, we are not looking at the file system.
[02:36:31.460 --> 02:36:38.740]  We are looking at a projection of data just as if you pulled up the photo picker, right?
[02:36:39.540 --> 02:36:40.820]  You don't think about the files.
[02:36:41.540 --> 02:36:43.140]  You think about the photos you've got.
[02:36:43.140 --> 02:36:46.420]  And I think that this is the, uh, the better way forward.
[02:36:46.420 --> 02:36:46.740]  Right.
[02:36:46.740 --> 02:36:47.940]  And it's not confusing.
[02:36:47.940 --> 02:36:48.740]  It might be limiting.
[02:36:48.740 --> 02:36:49.620]  It still is limiting.
[02:36:49.620 --> 02:36:56.260]  And until the document picker, it was definitely limiting because to open the same image on
[02:36:56.260 --> 02:37:01.460]  iOS that was from, it was in your photo, in your camera roll to open it in Afterlight or
[02:37:01.460 --> 02:37:04.900]  VSCO cam, you had to make a copy of it and import it into their thing.
[02:37:04.900 --> 02:37:05.780]  And then they would open it.
[02:37:05.780 --> 02:37:09.380]  And then if you wanted to save it back out, you'd have to save a new copy back to the
[02:37:09.380 --> 02:37:09.940]  photo roll.
[02:37:09.940 --> 02:37:15.060]  So you've got three copies now, your original, the one in VSCO cam and the one that was the
[02:37:15.060 --> 02:37:21.060]  filtered version saved back to your camera roll, obviously inefficient, but it didn't,
[02:37:21.060 --> 02:37:25.300]  you know, it was inefficient, but it didn't, you know, at least protected people from blowing
[02:37:25.300 --> 02:37:26.900]  their photos apart.
[02:37:26.900 --> 02:37:27.400]  Right.
[02:37:28.420 --> 02:37:30.100]  And the new way, you know, is better.
[02:37:30.100 --> 02:37:33.860]  It's way cooler that you can just open it right up in VSCO cam and it saves right back
[02:37:33.860 --> 02:37:34.980]  to the same camera roll.
[02:37:36.580 --> 02:37:46.260]  You know, it's great, but it was, that's what, that's the ultimate goal all along the
[02:37:46.260 --> 02:37:50.420]  whole, you know, idea that users are not going to have direct access to the file system because
[02:37:50.420 --> 02:37:51.540]  so many things could go bad.
[02:37:51.540 --> 02:37:55.140]  And to me, the most telltale sign that it was, that the file name extensions were a
[02:37:55.140 --> 02:37:58.980]  bad idea in the Mac was that they immediately defaulted to hiding them.
[02:37:58.980 --> 02:37:59.480]  Yeah.
[02:38:00.340 --> 02:38:02.100]  And was that in 10.0?
[02:38:02.100 --> 02:38:03.860]  I mean, it came pretty quick, right?
[02:38:03.860 --> 02:38:08.340]  I think it was in 10.0 where the file name extensions were hidden and it made people
[02:38:08.340 --> 02:38:16.740]  so confused because on the old Mac in classic Mac OS, if you had a file named portrait.jpg,
[02:38:18.420 --> 02:38:20.180]  it didn't have to have the.jpg.
[02:38:20.180 --> 02:38:22.740]  So you could just have, you didn't need the file extension.
[02:38:22.740 --> 02:38:24.980]  It could be a JPEG, but it would just be named portrait.
[02:38:24.980 --> 02:38:25.380]  Right.
[02:38:25.380 --> 02:38:29.300]  And if you had another file and you wanted to convert it to a different format, like
[02:38:29.300 --> 02:38:31.860]  ping or something like that, you couldn't give it the same name.
[02:38:31.860 --> 02:38:35.780]  You couldn't have two files named portrait in the same folder because it's a file system.
[02:38:35.780 --> 02:38:36.420]  You could do it.
[02:38:36.420 --> 02:38:41.540]  Whereas all of a sudden in Mac OS 10, you could have portrait.jpg and portrait.png in
[02:38:41.540 --> 02:38:42.180]  the same folder.
[02:38:42.180 --> 02:38:44.900]  And they both said portrait and they both look like the same image.
[02:38:44.900 --> 02:38:48.660]  And because the file extension is hidden, you can't tell which is yes.
[02:38:48.660 --> 02:38:49.060]  Right.
[02:38:49.060 --> 02:38:53.060]  So, you know, you're just talking yourself in circles when you start saying that we can
[02:38:53.060 --> 02:38:55.300]  do it and then to avoid the confusion, we'll hide it.
[02:38:55.300 --> 02:38:58.660]  And, you know, hiding things is never the right idea.
[02:38:59.620 --> 02:39:00.900]  So I agree with you.
[02:39:00.900 --> 02:39:02.340]  And I did at the time.
[02:39:02.340 --> 02:39:05.140]  I just think it's a pragmatic solution.
[02:39:05.140 --> 02:39:05.540]  Right.
[02:39:05.540 --> 02:39:10.820]  But, you know, the truth is the reason I'll say that it was we're all we're just fighting
[02:39:10.820 --> 02:39:14.500]  over which ways to be wrong because Mac users shot themselves in the foot.
[02:39:14.500 --> 02:39:16.980]  Mac users shot themselves in the foot with the file system, too.
[02:39:16.980 --> 02:39:20.340]  They just did it in different ways than Unix and Windows users.
[02:39:20.340 --> 02:39:27.540]  I just I feel that there is as yet an unsolved problem here.
[02:39:30.180 --> 02:39:33.620]  But I don't think exposing file systems is the way to go, basically.
[02:39:34.260 --> 02:39:35.540]  No, it's a developer.
[02:39:35.540 --> 02:39:37.700]  The file system is a developer level.
[02:39:37.700 --> 02:39:38.200]  Yeah.
[02:39:39.460 --> 02:39:40.100]  Anything else?
[02:39:40.100 --> 02:39:40.980]  We should wrap up.
[02:39:40.980 --> 02:39:42.420]  I'm kind of bored with you.
[02:39:42.420 --> 02:39:42.980]  Yeah, me too.
[02:39:44.100 --> 02:39:46.420]  Good thing we're running into each other in three days.
[02:39:46.420 --> 02:39:46.900]  I know.
[02:39:46.900 --> 02:39:47.460]  Yeah.
[02:39:47.460 --> 02:39:48.420]  It's going to be a good weekend.
[02:39:50.420 --> 02:39:52.420]  Well, at least we got all the nerd talk out of the way.
[02:39:52.420 --> 02:39:53.060]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:39:54.340 --> 02:40:00.660]  Let me let's give a big let's give a big pitch to the podcast because you're doing amazing,
[02:40:00.660 --> 02:40:04.580]  amazing work that you've dropped a couple of references to it, but you've got a series
[02:40:04.580 --> 02:40:06.500]  and this is on debug.
[02:40:06.500 --> 02:40:07.220]  Debug, yeah.
[02:40:08.020 --> 02:40:09.620]  Where you've got Nitin.
[02:40:11.620 --> 02:40:12.660]  Nitin Ganatra.
[02:40:12.660 --> 02:40:14.020]  Nitin Ganatra.
[02:40:14.020 --> 02:40:14.980]  Don Melton.
[02:40:14.980 --> 02:40:15.780]  Don Melton.
[02:40:15.780 --> 02:40:17.380]  Don Melton, you guys might know.
[02:40:17.380 --> 02:40:18.660]  He's left Apple recently.
[02:40:18.660 --> 02:40:26.500]  He was the head of the WebKit and Safari and adds a super colorful history in the industry
[02:40:26.500 --> 02:40:28.900]  and one of the best storytellers I've ever heard.
[02:40:30.900 --> 02:40:35.300]  And these are epic, epic podcasts that you guys have recorded with them.
[02:40:35.300 --> 02:40:38.180]  If part one was two hours and you just did a part two yesterday.
[02:40:39.620 --> 02:40:39.940]  Yeah.
[02:40:39.940 --> 02:40:49.140]  So I mean, we sat down with Nitin in June and I was as every podcast, I'm like, man,
[02:40:49.140 --> 02:40:51.940]  am I going to get an hour after this interview?
[02:40:52.740 --> 02:40:53.620]  I don't know if you do.
[02:40:53.620 --> 02:40:57.540]  Like, do you ever do a cold interview where you're like, I hope I get an hour out of this.
[02:40:58.340 --> 02:41:00.900]  And then it's forget it, it ran.
[02:41:00.900 --> 02:41:07.300]  And so we had like three episodes with Nitin totaling over six hours, which is horrible.
[02:41:07.300 --> 02:41:14.980]  And then we put Don Melton and Nitin together in Ganatra together, and we had another two
[02:41:14.980 --> 02:41:20.020]  hours, two hour episode, and we just recorded another two hours yesterday.
[02:41:20.020 --> 02:41:20.260]  Right.
[02:41:20.260 --> 02:41:24.260]  And Nitin's a guy who's, you know, as again, you don't want to make assumptions about how
[02:41:24.260 --> 02:41:25.300]  things work inside Apple.
[02:41:25.300 --> 02:41:28.820]  But like you said, he at one point, he was the head of iOS apps, right?
[02:41:28.820 --> 02:41:36.100]  What he literally came up from working on all kinds of old school Apple stuff, right?
[02:41:36.100 --> 02:41:41.460]  Like he's doing carbon, carbon file manager, like seriously low level carbon stuff, like
[02:41:41.460 --> 02:41:42.660]  the carbon file manager.
[02:41:44.340 --> 02:41:45.140]  He's brilliant.
[02:41:45.140 --> 02:41:52.420]  We may cut this out of the show, but they've both been at like the same top 100 meeting
[02:41:52.420 --> 02:41:53.140]  at Apple.
[02:41:53.140 --> 02:41:53.700]  Right.
[02:41:53.700 --> 02:41:54.100]  Right.
[02:41:54.100 --> 02:41:59.140]  And you know, if you want to hear some of our people speak about Apple.
[02:42:00.740 --> 02:42:04.100]  A little bit more freely than you're used to because they're not at Apple anymore.
[02:42:04.100 --> 02:42:11.700]  They're not at Apple, and you know, Ren, especially Ren, but myself too, we afford
[02:42:11.700 --> 02:42:17.940]  them a place where they can just speak freely and we'll cut anything that in retrospect
[02:42:17.940 --> 02:42:19.780]  they may not want to have said.
[02:42:19.780 --> 02:42:20.340]  Right.
[02:42:20.340 --> 02:42:24.020]  So that's at the debug podcast is...
[02:42:24.020 --> 02:42:26.500]  Yeah, I'm more.com slash debug.
[02:42:26.500 --> 02:42:28.420]  Yeah, I'm more.com slash debug.
[02:42:28.420 --> 02:42:33.780]  And that's like the only project that I'm willing to really plug because it's got very
[02:42:33.780 --> 02:42:36.820]  little to do with me and has like the guests are amazing.
[02:42:37.940 --> 02:42:38.340]  Okay.
[02:42:38.340 --> 02:42:40.900]  I was going to give you Vector too, but if you just want to...
[02:42:40.900 --> 02:42:42.660]  Yeah, if you want to do Vector, okay.
[02:42:43.300 --> 02:42:44.500]  That's for you.
[02:42:44.500 --> 02:42:46.260]  I'll keep quiet with that.
[02:42:46.260 --> 02:42:47.380]  Whiskus is on that too.
[02:42:48.100 --> 02:42:48.580]  Oh, is he?
[02:42:48.580 --> 02:42:49.940]  What's the one that Whiskus isn't on?
[02:42:51.540 --> 02:42:53.220]  What's the one that Jesse Char was recently on?
[02:42:54.020 --> 02:42:54.420]  Vector.
[02:42:55.300 --> 02:42:56.100]  Did you like that one?
[02:42:56.100 --> 02:42:56.980]  I like that one.
[02:42:56.980 --> 02:42:59.060]  Yeah, but was Whiskus on that one?
[02:42:59.060 --> 02:43:01.700]  No, he stepped out and Jesse stepped in.
[02:43:01.700 --> 02:43:03.860]  We just...maybe that's why I like that.
[02:43:03.860 --> 02:43:05.140]  Maybe that's why you like that one.
[02:43:05.140 --> 02:43:05.540]  Guess what?
[02:43:05.540 --> 02:43:06.580]  You're going to like the next one.
[02:43:07.220 --> 02:43:09.220]  Whiskus is also away.
[02:43:09.220 --> 02:43:11.860]  And hey, Dave, please edit this kindly.
[02:43:12.740 --> 02:43:13.780]  I know you're listening.
[02:43:14.340 --> 02:43:15.060]  Love you, buddy.
[02:43:16.340 --> 02:43:17.700]  The worst part is he cut in.
[02:43:17.700 --> 02:43:18.660]  He's got the final word.
[02:43:18.660 --> 02:43:19.060]  I know.
[02:43:19.060 --> 02:43:20.820]  He can actually just jump in here.
[02:43:23.540 --> 02:43:26.100]  And that's also I'm more.com slash vector.
[02:43:26.100 --> 02:43:26.820]  I mean more...
[02:43:26.820 --> 02:43:30.580]  This week is Christina Warren, who, guess what?
[02:43:31.940 --> 02:43:32.500]  Kind of smart.
[02:43:33.140 --> 02:43:33.860]  Yeah, very smart.
[02:43:35.860 --> 02:43:36.980]  She's in Mashable, I believe.
[02:43:36.980 --> 02:43:37.220]  Right.
[02:43:37.220 --> 02:43:41.140]  Probably best known to readers from her bylines at Mashable.
[02:43:41.140 --> 02:43:41.380]  Yeah.
[02:43:42.580 --> 02:43:43.940]  Yeah, where I just saw her recently.
[02:43:43.940 --> 02:43:44.660]  Where did I see her?
[02:43:45.380 --> 02:43:46.420]  The event, I guess.
[02:43:47.220 --> 02:43:49.220]  Yeah, I saw her somewhere else.
[02:43:49.220 --> 02:43:50.980]  But anyway, yeah, very, very smart.
[02:43:50.980 --> 02:43:56.660]  I believe she'll be here this weekend.
[02:43:56.660 --> 02:43:57.380]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:43:59.220 --> 02:44:04.420]  Well, two great podcasts that you host regularly and both of them have been on fire recently.
[02:44:04.420 --> 02:44:09.940]  So anybody looking for more podcasts that are on these lines, boy, I can't recommend those
[02:44:09.940 --> 02:44:10.260]  enough.
[02:44:10.260 --> 02:44:13.460]  And the debug ones are classic, seriously.
[02:44:13.460 --> 02:44:17.940]  I mean, I think that I don't mean to butter your toast here, guy, but honestly, I think
[02:44:17.940 --> 02:44:24.020]  that they're up there with some of the Andy Hertzfeld stuff in terms of get those transcribed
[02:44:24.020 --> 02:44:29.540]  because 15, 20 years from now, that's good stuff that's largely been undocumented.
[02:44:30.420 --> 02:44:36.820]  We transcribed all of them and we may be putting a collection at some point.
[02:44:36.820 --> 02:44:37.060]  Right.
[02:44:37.060 --> 02:44:43.380]  Because these stories are largely untold and some of them are told, but only like privately.
[02:44:43.380 --> 02:44:46.260]  But again, it's not like they're burning bridges.
[02:44:46.260 --> 02:44:51.060]  They're not spilling state secrets, but no, it's often it's years old stuff, but there's
[02:44:51.060 --> 02:44:52.980]  so much context and so much.
[02:44:54.820 --> 02:44:58.180]  I think you start to understand the culture a lot more.
[02:44:58.740 --> 02:44:59.140]  Yeah.
[02:44:59.140 --> 02:45:00.420]  No, you definitely do.
[02:45:00.420 --> 02:45:02.260]  And it's a great place to start.
[02:45:02.260 --> 02:45:02.660]  Thanks.
[02:45:02.660 --> 02:45:06.100]  And again, that's not me.
[02:45:06.660 --> 02:45:10.500]  We really just set the stage and we have some great people tell some great stories.
[02:45:11.540 --> 02:45:11.780]  Yeah.
[02:45:12.820 --> 02:45:13.620]  All right, guy English.
[02:45:13.620 --> 02:45:14.820]  I will see you soon.
[02:45:14.820 --> 02:45:16.180]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:45:16.180 --> 02:45:16.740]  This weekend.
[02:45:17.540 --> 02:45:18.100]  Bring your wife.
[02:45:18.100 --> 02:45:45.060]  I like her better.
