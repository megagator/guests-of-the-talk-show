[00:00.000 --> 00:01.440]  Hey, man, how's it getting?
[00:01.440 --> 00:04.160]  Well, you know, it's funny watching baseball
[00:04.160 --> 00:06.640]  when you don't really have a vested interest
[00:06.640 --> 00:07.920]  in any of the particular teams.
[00:07.920 --> 00:10.520]  And then I get like, I develop a little mini-interest
[00:10.520 --> 00:13.960]  in one of the teams and, you know, it's like,
[00:13.960 --> 00:15.520]  you know, I don't know, it's how it was.
[00:15.520 --> 00:16.800]  We were talking about it during the World Cup
[00:16.800 --> 00:19.120]  where like two teams who you don't really care about
[00:19.120 --> 00:19.960]  with our plan.
[00:19.960 --> 00:21.520]  And then one of them will do something
[00:21.520 --> 00:23.520]  and it's like, that's my team.
[00:23.520 --> 00:25.800]  And then you're like, invested for like,
[00:25.800 --> 00:27.800]  you're like a fan for an hour.
[00:27.800 --> 00:30.560]  Yeah, you know, until the duration is over.
[00:30.560 --> 00:33.200]  And then there's penalty kicks
[00:33.200 --> 00:34.920]  and you don't give a crap anymore.
[00:34.920 --> 00:38.280]  All right, now I became a temporary fan
[00:38.280 --> 00:39.880]  of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
[00:41.120 --> 00:43.360]  Simply because their manager is Don Mattingly,
[00:43.360 --> 00:45.880]  who was on, he was on the Yankees when I was growing up.
[00:45.880 --> 00:47.760]  He was my boyhood, thank you guys.
[00:47.760 --> 00:50.440]  That is a very, you think to do.
[00:50.440 --> 00:52.440]  That is so arbitrary, it's crazy.
[00:52.440 --> 00:54.520]  He was my favorite Yankee growing up.
[00:54.520 --> 00:56.520]  He was awesome, I always loved him.
[00:56.520 --> 00:57.680]  Do you call it manager's Yankees?
[00:57.680 --> 01:01.440]  That's, if you're, you know, he was a player for the Yankees.
[01:01.440 --> 01:02.720]  Oh, he was, oh, okay, I'm sorry.
[01:02.720 --> 01:03.760]  Yeah, he played first base.
[01:03.760 --> 01:05.040]  He was an all-star first baseman
[01:05.040 --> 01:06.840]  for the Yankees through the 80s.
[01:06.840 --> 01:10.720]  And then sort of a tragic career
[01:10.720 --> 01:15.040]  where he's without doubt the greatest New York Yankee
[01:15.040 --> 01:17.320]  who never won a World Series.
[01:17.320 --> 01:18.640]  And not only never won a World Series,
[01:18.640 --> 01:20.600]  he never won a playoff series.
[01:20.600 --> 01:24.480]  He played right after the Reggie Jackson era Yankees
[01:24.480 --> 01:25.880]  had won some World Series.
[01:25.880 --> 01:27.560]  And then he played right through the 80s
[01:27.560 --> 01:28.960]  and the early 90s when the Yankees
[01:28.960 --> 01:30.520]  were actually pretty bad overall.
[01:30.520 --> 01:33.240]  He was like the star player on pretty bad team.
[01:33.240 --> 01:34.800]  And then in his last season,
[01:34.800 --> 01:37.520]  and he got cut short, he had a relatively shorter career
[01:37.520 --> 01:40.920]  than most players, he had a bad back 1995.
[01:40.920 --> 01:42.360]  From injury, you're just.
[01:42.360 --> 01:44.960]  Yeah, well, just wear and tear, yeah, who knows.
[01:44.960 --> 01:46.360]  He kind of had a funny batting stance
[01:46.360 --> 01:48.520]  where he squatted over, maybe that contributed to it.
[01:48.520 --> 01:49.640]  But anyway, he had a bad back,
[01:49.640 --> 01:50.760]  so it was gonna be his last year.
[01:50.760 --> 01:52.800]  And the Yankees made the playoffs for the first time
[01:52.800 --> 01:54.040]  in a long time.
[01:54.040 --> 01:58.520]  And they lost a game five and a five game series
[01:58.520 --> 02:02.520]  to the Seattle Mariners, John Moltz of the team.
[02:02.520 --> 02:03.440]  That's not a real team.
[02:03.440 --> 02:04.720]  That's a Canadian team.
[02:04.720 --> 02:07.760]  Then he retired and then starting in 96,
[02:07.760 --> 02:10.120]  the Yankees won four of the next five World Series.
[02:11.560 --> 02:12.400]  So it was sort of.
[02:12.400 --> 02:13.240]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:13.240 --> 02:15.240]  So he's sort of a tragic figure in my mind.
[02:15.240 --> 02:16.960]  Now he's managing the Dodgers.
[02:16.960 --> 02:19.400]  Yeah, but you know, he's still working in the field.
[02:19.400 --> 02:21.160]  That's right.
[02:21.160 --> 02:22.960]  Not everybody gets to do that, right?
[02:22.960 --> 02:24.320]  Well, no, that's true.
[02:24.320 --> 02:25.160]  No.
[02:25.160 --> 02:27.200]  And they just, right before we started recording,
[02:27.200 --> 02:29.880]  they had a lot of central starters were eliminated.
[02:29.880 --> 02:35.520]  But just like the cherry on his shit Sunday, basically.
[02:35.520 --> 02:36.360]  Yeah.
[02:36.360 --> 02:37.200]  And it was close.
[02:37.200 --> 02:39.280]  It was three to two heartbreaker.
[02:39.280 --> 02:40.120]  So you know what?
[02:40.120 --> 02:42.760]  You're turning me around on baseball a little bit.
[02:42.760 --> 02:44.920]  Boy, the playoffs playoff baseball is a different sport.
[02:44.920 --> 02:45.760]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:45.760 --> 02:48.200]  I find a thing is great, but yeah.
[02:48.200 --> 02:49.560]  I could see how a lot of people,
[02:49.560 --> 02:51.600]  someone who doesn't really get it, could get it.
[02:51.600 --> 02:53.880]  Same thing to me with the soccer, right?
[02:53.880 --> 02:56.160]  I'm not going to really watch regular season soccer,
[02:56.160 --> 02:58.080]  but I'm into the world cup now.
[02:58.080 --> 02:59.840]  Yeah, great.
[02:59.840 --> 03:01.960]  The Euro too is probably going to be exciting.
[03:01.960 --> 03:04.240]  You know, you're as weird because you're
[03:04.240 --> 03:06.200]  going to have to pick something at random, right?
[03:06.200 --> 03:08.200]  You're never going to have a home team in the Euro.
[03:08.200 --> 03:10.200]  Right.
[03:10.200 --> 03:13.240]  But no, I mean, your conversation with Ben last week
[03:13.240 --> 03:13.920]  was great.
[03:13.920 --> 03:15.560]  I loved it.
[03:15.560 --> 03:20.720]  What I like about soccer is that, and it's kind of what
[03:20.720 --> 03:24.000]  you guys discussed, eventually the scoreline doesn't matter.
[03:24.000 --> 03:27.520]  It's the stories that get told after the game.
[03:27.520 --> 03:29.760]  And you cover that a lot with Derek Jeter.
[03:29.760 --> 03:30.600]  Right.
[03:30.600 --> 03:35.680]  Where you could both through count, crazy moves that you did.
[03:35.680 --> 03:41.400]  And not once did you ever really mention the scoreline.
[03:41.400 --> 03:41.680]  Right.
[03:41.680 --> 03:44.240]  And if you look at that sort of spreadsheet,
[03:44.240 --> 03:46.400]  like, you know, here's the game reduced to numbers.
[03:46.400 --> 03:47.960]  It just doesn't show up.
[03:47.960 --> 03:49.000]  It doesn't pop off the page.
[03:49.000 --> 03:50.480]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[03:50.480 --> 03:53.120]  Like, I call it, when I'm dismissive of a static call
[03:53.120 --> 03:56.960]  at a baseball stat, only because without context,
[03:56.960 --> 03:58.960]  so much stuff is just completely pointless.
[03:58.960 --> 04:00.120]  Like, there's really no reason to it.
[04:00.120 --> 04:04.360]  And I would adverse to baseball for many years
[04:04.360 --> 04:08.600]  probably still am, because it seems to fetishize stats
[04:08.600 --> 04:11.120]  in a way because nothing else is going on.
[04:11.120 --> 04:12.920]  Sometimes, yeah.
[04:12.920 --> 04:14.440]  Yeah, it lends itself to it, too.
[04:14.440 --> 04:15.840]  It's the pace of the game, too.
[04:15.840 --> 04:19.560]  And it's a game that lends itself to the keeping
[04:19.560 --> 04:23.680]  of innumerable statistics, and there's
[04:23.680 --> 04:27.440]  ways to show that all sorts of those statistics correlate,
[04:27.440 --> 04:30.280]  at least in some way, to winning and losing.
[04:30.280 --> 04:32.920]  And sure, you can, you know, it just lends itself
[04:32.920 --> 04:36.960]  to just elaborate, elaborate statistical analysis.
[04:36.960 --> 04:39.360]  And that turned me off, though, because when
[04:39.360 --> 04:43.800]  you start telling stories about Derek Jeter or whoever,
[04:43.800 --> 04:44.680]  I'm all into that.
[04:44.680 --> 04:45.800]  I love that kind of stuff.
[04:45.800 --> 04:49.040]  That's kind of why I like soccer.
[04:49.040 --> 04:55.520]  I don't want to say heroism, but it's the ups and downs
[04:55.520 --> 04:57.000]  of individual players and teams.
[04:57.000 --> 05:01.600]  And that kind of that captures my attention.
[05:01.600 --> 05:04.640]  Yeah, I have a bottom line for me, and I know every week
[05:04.640 --> 05:05.800]  there's always somebody out there who's like,
[05:05.800 --> 05:07.280]  I don't care about any sports at all.
[05:07.280 --> 05:09.120]  But the bottom line for me and the appeal,
[05:09.120 --> 05:11.080]  and it fits right in with, you know,
[05:11.080 --> 05:14.160]  and I take a guy like Jason Snow, who's a big baseball fan.
[05:14.160 --> 05:17.080]  He likes football, too, US football.
[05:17.080 --> 05:19.320]  But, you know, obviously with all the incomparable stuff
[05:19.320 --> 05:23.840]  he does, he consumes an enormous amount of fiction,
[05:23.840 --> 05:25.840]  narrative fiction.
[05:25.840 --> 05:28.120]  To me, it's a lot of sports fans, or at least
[05:28.120 --> 05:31.240]  that, like, in my friend Matt's Parliament
[05:31.240 --> 05:33.440]  stats versus story guys, the story guys like me,
[05:33.440 --> 05:35.280]  we watch sports for the same reason
[05:35.280 --> 05:40.240]  we like to watch things like movies, is there's drama.
[05:40.240 --> 05:41.840]  But it's the weird thing with sports.
[05:41.840 --> 05:43.760]  With a movie extensively, there's always
[05:43.760 --> 05:45.000]  going to be drama, and there's always
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.040]  going to be a good ending, and a good story.
[05:48.040 --> 05:50.040]  Sometimes a sports game is just boring,
[05:50.040 --> 05:51.960]  because one team jumps out, ate nothing,
[05:51.960 --> 05:54.080]  and it stays ate nothing, and it's kind of,
[05:54.080 --> 05:55.800]  well, that was kind of dull.
[05:55.800 --> 05:57.800]  So you can't fake it, and then all of a sudden,
[05:57.800 --> 06:00.320]  sometimes it's three to two in the ninth inning,
[06:00.320 --> 06:02.880]  and the bases are loaded, and nobody's out.
[06:02.880 --> 06:04.880]  And you've got a real story, and nobody,
[06:04.880 --> 06:08.600]  there's no one person, like an author or a director,
[06:08.600 --> 06:12.440]  who gets to decide how it turns out, based on what they think.
[06:12.440 --> 06:14.160]  And it's that difference, it's that realness.
[06:14.160 --> 06:19.320]  It's that sometimes it's going to, and the good guys,
[06:19.320 --> 06:23.800]  meaning the team I'm rooting for, the guys are going to lose.
[06:23.800 --> 06:25.120]  They're not always going to win.
[06:25.120 --> 06:28.360]  I'm like this, this Dodgers manager.
[06:28.360 --> 06:30.280]  Like a good man, yeah.
[06:30.280 --> 06:30.760]  Good guy.
[06:30.760 --> 06:32.440]  Best nickname ever, his nickname, literally,
[06:32.440 --> 06:35.560]  I swear to God, his nickname is Donnie Baseball.
[06:35.560 --> 06:36.840]  Oh, God.
[06:36.840 --> 06:39.920]  OK, this guy's aces, I like this guy.
[06:39.920 --> 06:41.720]  How does he do a really Donnie baseball?
[06:41.720 --> 06:43.240]  How does he get that?
[06:43.240 --> 06:43.760]  That's crazy.
[06:43.760 --> 06:46.240]  How did he get that nickname?
[06:46.240 --> 06:48.640]  Jessica, he's like the baseball player's baseball player.
[06:48.640 --> 06:49.000]  Really?
[06:49.000 --> 06:50.200]  He's that kind of.
[06:50.200 --> 06:51.040]  OK.
[06:51.040 --> 06:51.600]  Do you ever see it?
[06:51.600 --> 06:54.160]  Yeah, I swear to God, I Twitter it the other day.
[06:54.160 --> 06:56.400]  He's the guy who there's a YouTube clip of it,
[06:56.400 --> 06:59.400]  like a regular season game in 1985.
[06:59.400 --> 07:01.600]  There was a foul ball, a big high pop-up
[07:01.600 --> 07:03.720]  going over into the stands, and he ran over to see
[07:03.720 --> 07:04.520]  if he could catch it.
[07:04.520 --> 07:07.400]  And it went too far into the stands, he couldn't catch it.
[07:07.400 --> 07:09.080]  Meanwhile, there's a kid in the front row eating
[07:09.080 --> 07:11.040]  box of popcorn, and the kid had turned around
[07:11.040 --> 07:13.520]  to football, foul ball landed.
[07:13.520 --> 07:14.920]  And Mattingly just reaches over
[07:14.920 --> 07:18.400]  and takes a handful of popcorn and catches it.
[07:18.400 --> 07:20.120]  And then he just, the kid turns around,
[07:20.120 --> 07:23.680]  and is like, whoa, done Mattingly, just stole my popcorn.
[07:23.680 --> 07:25.520]  And then Mattingly just gives him like a little nod.
[07:25.520 --> 07:27.000]  Like, thanks for popcorn, kid.
[07:27.000 --> 07:29.120]  And it goes back to first base to finish the game.
[07:29.120 --> 07:31.880]  That's awesome.
[07:31.880 --> 07:32.200]  Right?
[07:32.200 --> 07:34.560]  That's that's why he's Donnie baseball.
[07:34.560 --> 07:35.060]  Goodening.
[07:35.060 --> 07:36.760]  Because while playing at the highest level,
[07:36.760 --> 07:39.360]  he's also thinking, man, I could go for some popcorn.
[07:39.360 --> 07:40.960]  That's perfect.
[07:40.960 --> 07:41.480]  See?
[07:41.480 --> 07:42.600]  Stories.
[07:42.600 --> 07:43.600]  Yeah.
[07:43.600 --> 07:45.120]  Yeah, that's, we'll see that's way better
[07:45.120 --> 07:46.320]  than what was batting average.
[07:46.320 --> 07:49.080]  Yeah, you're curious what it does matter, right?
[07:49.080 --> 07:50.240]  But he took the popcorn.
[07:50.240 --> 07:51.080]  That's right.
[07:51.080 --> 07:53.440]  That makes him cool to me.
[07:53.440 --> 07:54.320]  I don't care what you're doing.
[07:54.320 --> 07:55.880]  He's on my fantasy team.
[07:55.880 --> 07:58.360]  That's exactly immediately there.
[07:58.360 --> 07:58.680]  Yeah.
[07:58.680 --> 08:03.160]  Well, you want to talk non-sports.
[08:03.160 --> 08:07.880]  If anybody's listening, stop first of all, second,
[08:07.880 --> 08:11.640]  I'm not a sports guy, but I do enjoy stories right now.
[08:11.640 --> 08:16.520]  Yeah, to me, that's just a way of hopefully manufacturing
[08:16.520 --> 08:19.800]  some actual drama that's going to be,
[08:19.800 --> 08:23.680]  it's going to come to a conclusion, fair and square,
[08:23.680 --> 08:26.760]  based on the athletic abilities of the people involved.
[08:26.760 --> 08:28.120]  Well, not even fair and square.
[08:28.120 --> 08:30.120]  If you go to dirty, well, which is like, right,
[08:30.120 --> 08:33.840]  it's a kind of part of the story.
[08:33.840 --> 08:36.280]  But even then, it adds to the story.
[08:36.280 --> 08:38.280]  Yes, I totally agree.
[08:38.280 --> 08:40.280]  And the other thing too about that to me,
[08:40.280 --> 08:42.920]  it makes sports appealing is that it's the fact,
[08:42.920 --> 08:45.600]  it's the complaint that a lot of people have about sports
[08:45.600 --> 08:47.000]  is that, well, it's pointless.
[08:47.000 --> 08:49.560]  Well, that's sort of what makes it exciting
[08:49.560 --> 08:51.200]  because you can get all invested in it.
[08:51.200 --> 08:53.280]  And the team you're rooting for and more invested
[08:53.280 --> 08:58.080]  when lose, and it hurts and you're upset
[08:58.080 --> 09:00.720]  and you feel terrible for a day.
[09:00.720 --> 09:03.120]  But ultimately, it's OK because it was just a case.
[09:03.120 --> 09:04.120]  No, thank you.
[09:04.120 --> 09:07.800]  You've only invested what you've emotionally put on the table,
[09:07.800 --> 09:08.320]  right?
[09:08.320 --> 09:08.800]  Right.
[09:08.800 --> 09:11.360]  This is something to change anybody's life.
[09:11.360 --> 09:13.800]  Right, whereas unless you actually bet heavy,
[09:13.800 --> 09:15.600]  which don't do that, that's bad.
[09:15.600 --> 09:19.200]  Right, but whereas concentrating and obsessing over something
[09:19.200 --> 09:22.800]  that is even more dramatic, but where the stakes are real,
[09:22.800 --> 09:26.120]  like the situation in the Middle East
[09:26.120 --> 09:30.440]  between Israel and Palestine or with this ISIS outfit,
[09:30.440 --> 09:32.240]  anything like that.
[09:32.240 --> 09:37.560]  But there's all sorts of incredibly exciting drama involved.
[09:37.560 --> 09:38.840]  Great stories to be told.
[09:38.840 --> 09:41.320]  But the stakes are so real, and it's real stuff.
[09:41.320 --> 09:43.320]  You can't take it lightly.
[09:43.320 --> 09:45.640]  You can't, when there's a big turn of events,
[09:45.640 --> 09:48.200]  you can't go, well, that was something but too bad, you know?
[09:48.200 --> 09:49.040]  Yeah, I know.
[09:49.040 --> 09:49.880]  I totally agree.
[09:49.880 --> 09:53.880]  I think with sports, win or lose, in a way
[09:53.880 --> 09:55.640]  you can always laugh at yourself.
[09:55.640 --> 09:56.480]  Right.
[09:56.480 --> 09:59.520]  I can't believe I was so happy that this random team
[09:59.520 --> 10:01.200]  did this random thing, or I can't believe
[10:01.200 --> 10:06.160]  that I was so bummed out that they lost with real life
[10:06.160 --> 10:08.840]  stuff, like what you're talking about.
[10:08.840 --> 10:11.800]  You don't get to laugh at yourself, because it's, you know,
[10:11.800 --> 10:12.840]  people's lives on the line.
[10:12.840 --> 10:14.680]  It's like a real thing, so.
[10:14.680 --> 10:16.960]  Right, we can be happy that the Death Star got blown up
[10:16.960 --> 10:19.720]  because, you know, the six billion people on the planet
[10:19.720 --> 10:21.360]  Aldrin weren't real people.
[10:21.360 --> 10:22.560]  Exactly, yeah.
[10:22.560 --> 10:25.360]  There wasn't actually a real Holocaust that happened.
[10:25.360 --> 10:27.880]  It was just something that was in a space movie.
[10:27.880 --> 10:30.440]  Yeah, like if you actually think about how horrible that movie
[10:30.440 --> 10:33.680]  is, that's a lot of dead people in there.
[10:33.680 --> 10:37.440]  They could be like the number one dead people movie.
[10:37.440 --> 10:39.720]  Right, there might have been more people killed in that movie
[10:39.720 --> 10:41.480]  than any other movie ever filmed.
[10:41.480 --> 10:44.080]  I think that that's an interesting argument.
[10:44.080 --> 10:46.640]  I would almost certainly think that that's the case.
[10:46.640 --> 10:47.760]  It's got to be close, right?
[10:47.760 --> 10:51.320]  I mean, if you assume we didn't learn much about Aldrin,
[10:51.320 --> 10:53.440]  but that's assume it was roughly Earth-like.
[10:53.440 --> 10:54.280]  Yeah.
[10:54.280 --> 10:56.520]  Then there's five to six billion people on there.
[10:56.520 --> 10:57.360]  Right.
[10:57.360 --> 10:59.040]  Plus all of the people dead on the Death Star,
[10:59.040 --> 11:01.840]  which has been gone into.
[11:01.840 --> 11:04.960]  Yeah, plus the innumerable rebels killed.
[11:04.960 --> 11:06.360]  Right.
[11:06.360 --> 11:09.960]  Mix to mix Darth Vader seemed like a teddy bear.
[11:09.960 --> 11:12.840]  Right, because he only killed one person at a time.
[11:12.840 --> 11:14.200]  He's not very bad.
[11:14.200 --> 11:16.040]  Yeah, he didn't have anything to do with fire in the Death Star.
[11:16.040 --> 11:16.840]  That was all talking.
[11:16.840 --> 11:17.800]  Exactly.
[11:17.800 --> 11:18.760]  God, I hate that guy.
[11:22.760 --> 11:24.840]  Want to talk what people want to hear about?
[11:24.840 --> 11:26.200]  Yeah.
[11:26.200 --> 11:26.560]  You know what, though?
[11:26.560 --> 11:27.880]  It's a good time before we get started
[11:27.880 --> 11:29.720]  on what people really want to hear about.
[11:29.720 --> 11:32.800]  Let's knock out the first sponsor.
[11:32.800 --> 11:35.080]  And let me tell everybody about our good friends,
[11:35.080 --> 11:39.920]  returning as a sponsor of the show, our good friends at Harries.
[11:39.920 --> 11:45.720]  Harries makes high quality men's shaving stuff
[11:45.720 --> 11:50.640]  and makes it available at a terrific price.
[11:50.640 --> 11:53.000]  I've told you this before, but it's a great story.
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.800]  Harries were started by a guy who went in,
[11:55.800 --> 11:57.800]  it was out of town traveling, went into a drug store
[11:57.800 --> 12:01.040]  because he realized he didn't pack his shaving stuff, went in.
[12:01.040 --> 12:03.520]  And all the shaving stuff in the drug store
[12:03.520 --> 12:05.160]  is all locked up behind a case.
[12:05.160 --> 12:06.160]  You have to get a clerk.
[12:06.160 --> 12:07.560]  You have to let them open it.
[12:07.560 --> 12:09.680]  And then you find out it's like 40 bucks
[12:09.680 --> 12:11.760]  for a pack of razor blades.
[12:11.760 --> 12:14.120]  So he thought, hey, there's got to be a better way.
[12:14.120 --> 12:16.240]  This stuff is only like two or three big companies,
[12:16.240 --> 12:19.080]  Gilad and Shik and whoever else who control this stuff.
[12:19.080 --> 12:21.800]  These prices have got to be artificially high.
[12:21.800 --> 12:24.240]  Ends up, they are.
[12:24.240 --> 12:26.080]  And good against it.
[12:26.080 --> 12:31.080]  So Harries just a pure old-fashioned disruption.
[12:32.040 --> 12:34.040]  You go, you sign up at Harries.
[12:34.040 --> 12:38.200]  You get a kit, you get a reusable razor
[12:38.200 --> 12:40.440]  and then you get a couple of blades to start with.
[12:40.440 --> 12:44.080]  And then going forward, you just get new blades sent to you.
[12:44.080 --> 12:47.720]  Really good price, half the price of the competitors,
[12:47.720 --> 12:49.600]  like Gilad Marco did the research.
[12:49.600 --> 12:51.840]  Mario just steal his research from an ATP
[12:51.840 --> 12:52.720]  where they sponsored.
[12:52.720 --> 12:57.120]  But Marco went to Amazon and priced a pack
[12:57.120 --> 12:59.200]  of Gilad fusion blades.
[13:00.280 --> 13:01.360]  It was like 40 some bucks.
[13:01.360 --> 13:02.200]  That's Amazon.
[13:02.200 --> 13:04.800]  We know Amazon cuts the prices about as low
[13:04.800 --> 13:06.200]  as they're going to go retail.
[13:06.200 --> 13:10.400]  Same equivalent pack of blades from Harries was 20 bucks.
[13:10.400 --> 13:11.240]  Really.
[13:11.240 --> 13:12.080]  So when they say half the price,
[13:12.080 --> 13:13.600]  it's not like about half the price.
[13:13.600 --> 13:15.560]  Literally, half the price.
[13:15.560 --> 13:16.400]  Ship them right to you.
[13:16.400 --> 13:18.480]  Really, really cool product design.
[13:18.480 --> 13:22.840]  That just nice feel, nice feel to the stuff.
[13:22.840 --> 13:23.840]  Really nice heft.
[13:23.840 --> 13:25.480]  Really like, I love the thing.
[13:25.480 --> 13:28.520]  It just feels like something's gonna last forever.
[13:28.520 --> 13:31.560]  Nice branding, everything's nice, nice packaging.
[13:31.560 --> 13:32.720]  Everything opens up nice.
[13:32.720 --> 13:34.920]  There's no blister packs or any crap like that.
[13:34.920 --> 13:37.280]  It's just a nice little cardboard package open up.
[13:38.240 --> 13:39.960]  Just couldn't be better.
[13:39.960 --> 13:41.440]  If you're using anything else,
[13:41.440 --> 13:42.800]  you're probably paying too much
[13:42.800 --> 13:45.160]  and you're probably not getting as good as stuff.
[13:45.160 --> 13:47.120]  And the other thing, I always love this too
[13:47.120 --> 13:49.360]  because it just shows how serious these guys are
[13:49.360 --> 13:51.360]  is that they're not just like white labeling
[13:51.360 --> 13:52.760]  some kind of razor blades they get
[13:52.760 --> 13:54.080]  from some generic contractor.
[13:54.080 --> 13:58.080]  Like they went to Germany and bought a razor blade factory
[13:58.080 --> 14:01.760]  and they make their own German engineered razor blades.
[14:02.720 --> 14:05.560]  Like they're not just buying Chinese razors
[14:05.560 --> 14:07.560]  and putting Harries name on it.
[14:07.560 --> 14:09.200]  They make in their own in Germany.
[14:09.200 --> 14:09.800]  I love it.
[14:10.840 --> 14:12.560]  Super convenient, just like anything else
[14:12.560 --> 14:14.240]  that once you get used to ordering it online
[14:14.240 --> 14:15.480]  instead of having to go to the store
[14:15.480 --> 14:17.600]  and buy it every couple of weeks or months,
[14:17.600 --> 14:18.760]  you just never go back.
[14:19.760 --> 14:21.560]  Really good stuff, high quality, great price.
[14:21.560 --> 14:22.480]  So here's what you do.
[14:22.480 --> 14:24.920]  And you'll get five bucks off your first purchase
[14:24.920 --> 14:26.520]  if you do what I tell you to do,
[14:26.520 --> 14:31.520]  which is go to Harries.com, H-A-R-R-Y-S.com
[14:32.920 --> 14:36.280]  and use the promo code, talkshow.
[14:36.280 --> 14:39.080]  Just T-A-L-K-S-H-O-W.
[14:39.080 --> 14:41.880]  And you'll save five bucks off your first purchase
[14:41.880 --> 14:43.880]  and their regular prices are already really low.
[14:43.880 --> 14:46.160]  So go do that, my thanks to Harries.
[14:48.160 --> 14:52.400]  Full disclosure, Harries also sponsors my show.
[14:52.400 --> 14:54.960]  But you know what, pretty awesome.
[14:54.960 --> 14:55.800]  I'm really happy.
[14:55.800 --> 14:57.320]  I have you, in the past two days,
[14:57.320 --> 15:00.440]  I got some samples of new shaving cream
[15:00.440 --> 15:01.440]  in an aftershave.
[15:02.560 --> 15:03.880]  I didn't get anything, Lil, so I missed it.
[15:03.880 --> 15:04.720]  Oh, they don't like you.
[15:04.720 --> 15:06.520]  No, but they love me.
[15:06.520 --> 15:07.840]  And I'm telling you, it's crazy.
[15:07.840 --> 15:09.000]  I think Whiska takes all this.
[15:09.000 --> 15:09.840]  I think Whiska takes all this.
[15:09.840 --> 15:10.680]  I think Whiska takes all this.
[15:10.680 --> 15:11.920]  Probably just swipes every night.
[15:11.920 --> 15:14.760]  No, you know, I heard that.
[15:14.760 --> 15:16.400]  I heard that they got a new cream.
[15:16.400 --> 15:18.560]  They have like a lathering cream instead of a,
[15:18.560 --> 15:19.720]  like the first cream that they have,
[15:19.720 --> 15:21.480]  which is the one I use is,
[15:21.480 --> 15:23.240]  it doesn't really work up a lather.
[15:23.240 --> 15:24.240]  It's just a cream.
[15:24.240 --> 15:27.040]  It works great, but it doesn't like foam up
[15:27.040 --> 15:27.880]  so the new one does.
[15:27.880 --> 15:29.080]  And that's some people just, yeah,
[15:29.080 --> 15:30.400]  some people just like it the foam up.
[15:30.400 --> 15:31.240]  Yep. And now they have one of them.
[15:31.240 --> 15:33.080]  And today, just today, I haven't tried it yet,
[15:33.080 --> 15:34.920]  but the bottle looks awesome.
[15:34.920 --> 15:39.360]  I have like an aftershave sort of thing to try tomorrow.
[15:39.360 --> 15:40.200]  Yeah.
[15:40.200 --> 15:42.280]  But it's great. I love it.
[15:42.280 --> 15:45.040]  And you know what, besides the product,
[15:45.040 --> 15:46.560]  the packaging is incredible.
[15:47.640 --> 15:50.440]  Like just the way the delivery, the design,
[15:50.440 --> 15:53.440]  everything about it is just amazing.
[15:53.440 --> 15:55.960]  Like I don't even care what's in the bottle.
[15:55.960 --> 15:56.800]  I feel bad.
[15:56.800 --> 15:57.960]  It's one of those things, it's like Apple products
[15:57.960 --> 15:59.560]  where I feel bad throwing the box out.
[15:59.560 --> 16:01.880]  Yeah, I keep my boxes until I get made fun of
[16:01.880 --> 16:02.720]  to the point.
[16:02.720 --> 16:04.560]  I was like, no, I've really got to get rid of this thing.
[16:04.560 --> 16:05.960]  I still have my Mac Pro box.
[16:05.960 --> 16:07.080]  It's just sitting there.
[16:08.280 --> 16:09.840]  No good reason.
[16:09.840 --> 16:10.680]  Anyway.
[16:11.800 --> 16:13.840]  So I don't know, we're what, 20 minutes in?
[16:13.840 --> 16:16.880]  You want to get the show going?
[16:16.880 --> 16:20.040]  Yeah, here's my big topic, I think.
[16:20.040 --> 16:21.520]  And I don't know where the lead is
[16:21.520 --> 16:23.160]  when we get into the details.
[16:23.160 --> 16:27.600]  But it's this idea that you and I have been involved
[16:27.600 --> 16:29.800]  in several of these threads this week on Twitter.
[16:29.800 --> 16:31.720]  A couple of people have to.
[16:31.720 --> 16:34.000]  And I think it's not that I'm hunting
[16:34.000 --> 16:35.040]  for people who agree with me,
[16:35.040 --> 16:36.600]  but I just, there doesn't really see,
[16:36.600 --> 16:37.960]  I found it very curious
[16:37.960 --> 16:39.760]  that there was nobody arguing the other side.
[16:39.760 --> 16:42.400]  Which is more or less a thesis that,
[16:43.400 --> 16:45.000]  well, there are two ways to pose it.
[16:45.000 --> 16:48.040]  At least this year with iOS 8 and Yosemite,
[16:48.040 --> 16:51.120]  Apple bit off more than it could chew
[16:51.120 --> 16:54.680]  in terms of how much it was going to do and ship.
[16:54.680 --> 16:58.560]  And it's the quality control is suffering, therefore,
[16:58.560 --> 17:01.320]  that they tried to do too much by September.
[17:01.320 --> 17:03.200]  When they had to ship iOS 8,
[17:03.200 --> 17:05.320]  because the new iPhones needed iOS 8.
[17:07.440 --> 17:09.160]  And at this annual schedule,
[17:09.160 --> 17:10.640]  they're not that the annual schedule
[17:10.640 --> 17:14.400]  isn't necessarily to short a period,
[17:14.400 --> 17:16.560]  but that they're trying to do too much
[17:16.560 --> 17:17.800]  in those annual schedules.
[17:17.800 --> 17:18.880]  And if they want to do that much
[17:18.880 --> 17:20.040]  between major releases,
[17:20.040 --> 17:21.520]  it has to be more than a year.
[17:21.520 --> 17:22.680]  And if they want it to be a year,
[17:22.680 --> 17:24.680]  they have to do less at a time.
[17:24.680 --> 17:29.200]  Okay, so yeah, I don't know.
[17:29.200 --> 17:31.960]  I was asked about this and I kind of disagreed with you.
[17:31.960 --> 17:34.960]  And stated like that,
[17:34.960 --> 17:36.040]  I actually do agree with you,
[17:36.040 --> 17:39.360]  because I think we probably think this similarly
[17:39.360 --> 17:40.680]  on a lot of these subjects.
[17:42.640 --> 17:45.840]  You can't keep making the giant leaps
[17:45.840 --> 17:49.480]  that each of these OSs take in this space of a year.
[17:49.480 --> 17:52.320]  And the reason for that is that you don't have a year
[17:52.320 --> 17:53.160]  to do it.
[17:53.160 --> 17:55.160]  You've got maybe four to five,
[17:55.160 --> 17:57.600]  maybe six if you're lucky months.
[17:57.600 --> 17:59.600]  Yeah, and you made this point on,
[18:00.800 --> 18:02.600]  it was a vector last week or debug.
[18:02.600 --> 18:04.400]  It could, I don't know.
[18:04.400 --> 18:05.400]  I don't know.
[18:05.400 --> 18:07.640]  Whichever one, but yeah, explain, but explain.
[18:07.640 --> 18:11.000]  I thought this was, and I don't think that this,
[18:11.000 --> 18:12.160]  I don't think people think this
[18:12.160 --> 18:13.960]  because people think like, well,
[18:13.960 --> 18:15.840]  it's been a year since iOS 7 came out.
[18:15.840 --> 18:18.000]  So why couldn't they do this any year, but explain?
[18:18.000 --> 18:19.280]  Right, so I mean, the reason is,
[18:19.280 --> 18:20.600]  and this is not just me.
[18:20.600 --> 18:23.440]  This is, you know, I've talked to project managers
[18:23.440 --> 18:25.600]  and people inside Apple.
[18:25.600 --> 18:28.280]  So I actually know that this is pretty much the fact
[18:29.560 --> 18:30.400]  with the case.
[18:30.400 --> 18:32.320]  I don't want to say fact because I can't prove it.
[18:32.320 --> 18:36.080]  Um, the first few months
[18:36.080 --> 18:39.800]  are spent fixing the bugs that you did ship, right?
[18:39.800 --> 18:41.680]  That's the 8.01.
[18:41.680 --> 18:43.760]  And even it just could be a panic
[18:43.760 --> 18:45.000]  and we should get back to it.
[18:45.000 --> 18:46.240]  But yeah, if you forget,
[18:46.240 --> 18:48.320]  if you forget what it was like a year ago
[18:48.320 --> 18:49.920]  when iOS 7 first ship, don't worry about it.
[18:49.920 --> 18:52.040]  Just think about what you must assume
[18:52.040 --> 18:54.400]  people at Apple who work on iOS are doing right now.
[18:54.400 --> 18:56.960]  Today is they've got to be working on iOS 8 bugs.
[18:56.960 --> 18:58.960]  Have to be, everybody knows it.
[18:58.960 --> 19:00.360]  All right, so they're doing that now.
[19:00.360 --> 19:03.840]  Ship it, call that October, November, maybe even December.
[19:03.840 --> 19:08.840]  Yeah, so the iOS 8.01 bug hit 40 to 50,000 people out of
[19:11.400 --> 19:15.360]  what I understand to be like a 10 million install base.
[19:17.480 --> 19:19.320]  Despite that being a little percentage,
[19:19.320 --> 19:22.960]  that is a lot of people and it is bad mojo.
[19:22.960 --> 19:24.280]  It's bad news, right?
[19:24.280 --> 19:26.400]  So yeah, and it's enough.
[19:26.400 --> 19:28.240]  Like, and you know, it's, you know, I've clearly,
[19:28.240 --> 19:29.080]  this is a small sample.
[19:29.080 --> 19:29.920]  This is the definition of this.
[19:29.920 --> 19:32.120]  Exactly. But the day that that happened,
[19:32.120 --> 19:35.520]  that the 8.01 day, I think it was a Wednesday,
[19:35.520 --> 19:37.720]  whatever day the week it was midday.
[19:37.720 --> 19:41.600]  And my pal Lee, the bartender,
[19:41.600 --> 19:42.440]  oh man.
[19:42.440 --> 19:43.280]  I'm seeing London.
[19:43.280 --> 19:43.640]  That's okay.
[19:43.640 --> 19:44.800]  Hey Lee.
[19:44.800 --> 19:49.680]  He was guest bartending at a Jose Garshas restaurant
[19:49.680 --> 19:53.560]  here in Philadelphia for a happy hour and invited me and Amy
[19:53.560 --> 19:54.240]  to come.
[19:54.240 --> 19:58.600]  And so got the kid taken care of it, you know,
[19:58.600 --> 20:01.240]  five went out and had a couple cocktails with Lee
[20:01.240 --> 20:02.080]  at a new place.
[20:02.080 --> 20:04.920]  And he sat us next to a guy and the guy he sat us next to
[20:04.920 --> 20:06.720]  happened to be, he was like, are you John Gruber?
[20:06.720 --> 20:08.600]  And I was like, and I don't get that much in Philadelphia.
[20:08.600 --> 20:09.440]  And I was like, I say, I am.
[20:09.440 --> 20:11.000]  And he ends up he's a big fan.
[20:12.280 --> 20:15.520]  He's just an attorney, it works in Philadelphia.
[20:15.520 --> 20:17.280]  Also a fan of Hopsing Laundromat,
[20:17.280 --> 20:20.280]  brick design phone six plus that day.
[20:20.280 --> 20:23.280]  Because he like came out, he had like, he had like
[20:23.280 --> 20:25.560]  court in the morning, had lunch, came out of lunch,
[20:25.560 --> 20:28.320]  saw that 8.01 was out, hit update.
[20:28.320 --> 20:32.520]  And by one o'clock, his brand new iPhone six plus
[20:32.520 --> 20:33.680]  couldn't make phone calls.
[20:33.680 --> 20:37.080]  So, you know, I thought that was really interesting.
[20:37.080 --> 20:39.800]  Wow, I just, you know, met somebody who got hit by the bug.
[20:39.800 --> 20:41.000]  You know, so I was like, it seems to me,
[20:41.000 --> 20:42.040]  like it's pretty prevalent.
[20:42.040 --> 20:44.320]  40, 50,000 people, again, it could have been a lot worse
[20:44.320 --> 20:45.600]  if it was everybody.
[20:45.600 --> 20:46.520]  Right.
[20:46.520 --> 20:48.240]  But I think the window was pretty small, right?
[20:48.240 --> 20:51.600]  It was, I don't know how many hours it was posted for.
[20:51.600 --> 20:55.280]  Well, but it was weird though, because it's one of those
[20:55.280 --> 20:57.680]  weird things about the way stuff propagates around the
[20:57.680 --> 21:00.920]  world with Apple and the CDNs that they use where they
[21:00.920 --> 21:03.040]  were still, I was still getting hearing from people on Twitter
[21:03.040 --> 21:06.320]  saying it like four in the afternoon on Eastern time that
[21:06.320 --> 21:08.120]  their iPhone was still offering it.
[21:08.120 --> 21:10.400]  And they knew not to allow it.
[21:10.400 --> 21:12.320]  But if they didn't, you know, hadn't been following the
[21:12.320 --> 21:14.680]  tech news of the day, they might have that it, you know,
[21:14.680 --> 21:16.560]  still hadn't been rescinded from at least their
[21:16.560 --> 21:17.840]  phone's perspective.
[21:17.840 --> 21:21.480]  Yeah, and you know, you have a pretty bad audience, but
[21:21.480 --> 21:24.800]  that is a tiny slice of Apple consumers, right?
[21:24.800 --> 21:27.800]  So yeah, and I guess it kind of makes sense that that would
[21:27.800 --> 21:30.200]  be the max, you know, that something like that would be
[21:30.200 --> 21:33.280]  the number, because if it was 100% of people, then it
[21:33.280 --> 21:34.040]  would have been caught.
[21:34.040 --> 21:37.520]  Yeah, it must whatever the circumstances were that made
[21:37.520 --> 21:39.640]  that that that made this.
[21:39.640 --> 21:40.840]  And I've still not seen anybody.
[21:40.840 --> 21:42.120]  Apparently it's a delta update.
[21:42.120 --> 21:45.200]  Like if you just, it's the delta download from a specific
[21:45.200 --> 21:49.360]  version to screws it up, yeah, well, apparently I think.
[21:49.360 --> 21:51.200]  Yeah, but it must have been something like that, because if
[21:51.200 --> 21:53.480]  it had affected everybody, it never were made it out of
[21:53.480 --> 21:57.640]  QA, you know, if it only affected, I don't know, 5% for some
[21:57.640 --> 22:01.640]  reason, you know, that the, you know, if you have this,
[22:01.640 --> 22:04.120]  if you have that, if you have this, then the, you know, it
[22:04.120 --> 22:06.720]  breaks your phone, right, just didn't, wasn't in their
[22:06.720 --> 22:08.080]  testing matrix, I guess.
[22:09.040 --> 22:12.600]  I think it was business inside of the try to name the, or
[22:12.600 --> 22:14.200]  they did actually name the QA manager.
[22:14.200 --> 22:15.560]  No, business, it was business week.
[22:15.560 --> 22:16.360]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[22:17.480 --> 22:20.640]  I've got, yeah, it's funny that it got out of business
[22:20.640 --> 22:24.440]  inside of, but yeah, okay, so business week, don't do that.
[22:24.440 --> 22:25.800]  That's horrible reporting.
[22:25.800 --> 22:28.760]  You're missing the story and it's completely pointless.
[22:28.760 --> 22:31.200]  Yeah, that was a really, I thought that was so uncalled for
[22:31.200 --> 22:32.080]  it's just dumb.
[22:32.080 --> 22:36.320]  It's, it's like when he says DS called out the gathered losses,
[22:36.320 --> 22:38.280]  iPhone for a prototype, right?
[22:38.280 --> 22:39.600]  And I guess what?
[22:39.600 --> 22:43.840]  I guess I'm going to call you out, um, which is, again,
[22:43.840 --> 22:44.840]  they take move.
[22:44.840 --> 22:45.520]  It was even worse.
[22:45.520 --> 22:47.080]  I would say it was even worse.
[22:47.080 --> 22:47.440]  Really?
[22:47.440 --> 22:50.560]  Well, maybe it was an entire piece based on who
[22:50.560 --> 22:51.560]  this guy was.
[22:51.560 --> 22:52.560]  There was no reason for that.
[22:52.560 --> 22:55.920]  This poor kid, I'm calling him a kid, but whatever.
[22:55.920 --> 22:57.880]  He was, he was 20 some odd.
[22:57.880 --> 23:00.080]  It made it genuinely honest.
[23:00.080 --> 23:01.720]  It was an honest mistake.
[23:01.720 --> 23:02.720]  People screw up.
[23:02.720 --> 23:06.440]  There was no need to rake him up the coals and, and out him.
[23:06.440 --> 23:08.640]  Like, you know, at least focus on the phone that you got.
[23:08.640 --> 23:12.520]  You really don't need to do a piece about the, the, you know, the guy
[23:12.520 --> 23:14.360]  that goofed and lost it.
[23:14.360 --> 23:15.360]  Yeah.
[23:15.360 --> 23:18.320]  Uh, I, I was going to say that it was worse, though.
[23:18.320 --> 23:19.800]  And I don't, worse is the wrong word.
[23:19.800 --> 23:22.760]  But I would say, the, the reason I was going to say that, though, is at least with the
[23:22.760 --> 23:27.400]  kid who lost the iPhone, he really did lose the iPhone and what he was accused of having
[23:27.400 --> 23:34.440]  done is exactly what he did that he had, uh, as an engineer, he had access to pre-release
[23:34.440 --> 23:35.440]  iPhone.
[23:35.440 --> 23:36.440]  What was it?
[23:36.440 --> 23:43.040]  The iPhone 4 to use in the wild for field testing and left it at a bar restaurant.
[23:43.040 --> 23:44.040]  Well, we don't know.
[23:44.040 --> 23:49.160]  Or it was lifted or it was lifted, but, but, you know, but it was not within when
[23:49.160 --> 23:50.160]  he left, right?
[23:50.160 --> 23:51.160]  Right.
[23:51.160 --> 23:52.160]  Which is exactly what happened.
[23:52.160 --> 23:53.160]  Nobody's that's not in dispute.
[23:53.160 --> 23:57.760]  The first thing he did in the morning, or it's like calling to be like, yo, I lost my
[23:57.760 --> 23:58.760]  iPhone.
[23:58.760 --> 23:59.760]  Right.
[23:59.760 --> 24:00.760]  Yeah.
[24:00.760 --> 24:01.760]  Right.
[24:01.760 --> 24:02.760]  He did the right thing.
[24:02.760 --> 24:05.680]  You know, but with the business week story, name in the guy as being responsible for
[24:05.680 --> 24:07.480]  this 801 update.
[24:07.480 --> 24:11.360]  And then further saying that he was on the QA team that he was the leader of the QA team
[24:11.360 --> 24:15.000]  for the Apple Maps, it's sure done.
[24:15.000 --> 24:16.680]  It's actually wrong, though.
[24:16.680 --> 24:19.120]  Like, you know, I did the same thing as you, I asked around.
[24:19.120 --> 24:23.960]  And it, and, you know, the guy is responsible for some level of QA at Apple, but nobody
[24:23.960 --> 24:29.240]  inside Apple that I talked to said that there's any sense that he like single handedly
[24:29.240 --> 24:34.800]  pulled the trigger or deserves that anybody other than the entire company deserves team
[24:34.800 --> 24:37.320]  credit for the, for the fiasco.
[24:37.320 --> 24:41.480]  You know, business week made it sound like one guy was like hitting a button and saying
[24:41.480 --> 24:42.880]  it's ready to go.
[24:42.880 --> 24:43.880]  Yeah.
[24:43.880 --> 24:44.880]  It's.
[24:44.880 --> 24:50.000]  And his role, his role on maps was had nothing to do with the maps data.
[24:50.000 --> 24:56.000]  It was the maps app, which nobody, which I know for users, they don't have, it doesn't
[24:56.000 --> 24:57.000]  make a difference.
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.520]  They don't see a difference between the data and the app.
[25:00.520 --> 25:03.600]  But anybody who's listening to this show knows the difference.
[25:03.600 --> 25:04.600]  Do you know what?
[25:04.600 --> 25:08.320]  Anybody reporting on technology for business week should know the difference.
[25:08.320 --> 25:09.320]  Right.
[25:09.320 --> 25:15.880]  It's like being, you know, it's, it's sort of like, it's sort of like the difference between
[25:15.880 --> 25:20.840]  your email client and what's in your emails, you know, it's like, it's not your email
[25:20.840 --> 25:24.520]  clients fault if the emails are full of junk.
[25:24.520 --> 25:26.400]  And the maps app worked fine.
[25:26.400 --> 25:30.880]  It was just that it had bad data and, you know, empty data that it was missing a lot of
[25:30.880 --> 25:32.880]  data, which he had nothing to do with.
[25:32.880 --> 25:38.000]  It was, that wasn't what he was QA yet there is listed in business week is like, you
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.880]  know, and the insinuation, it wasn't quite directed.
[25:40.880 --> 25:44.880]  But the only insinuation you could draw from it is, that was the worst thing though, is
[25:44.880 --> 25:51.600]  that it wasn't insinuation and it wasn't like putting all the wood behind the arrow.
[25:51.600 --> 25:52.800]  Like at least that would be a thing.
[25:52.800 --> 25:56.600]  This was just more like, this was like backhanded gossipy stuff.
[25:56.600 --> 25:57.600]  Yeah.
[25:57.600 --> 26:02.680]  And it's like the insinuation is Apple has, you know, at least one in Napto Boseau running,
[26:02.680 --> 26:07.120]  you know, doing it right away, who's who's still, you know, after he's, you know, made
[26:07.120 --> 26:12.680]  a terrible mistake with the maps is still breaking new iPhones, which is so far.
[26:12.680 --> 26:14.080]  It's just way off base.
[26:14.080 --> 26:15.080]  Yeah.
[26:15.080 --> 26:19.240]  Somebody buy that guy a beer because he probably deserves it after this.
[26:19.240 --> 26:23.520]  I'll tell you, I don't think I've ever told this story publicly, I don't think, but
[26:23.520 --> 26:24.520]  I will.
[26:24.520 --> 26:29.360]  The writer, at least one of the writers on that story was Adam Satoriano.
[26:29.360 --> 26:37.040]  And Adam Satoriano, a couple of years ago wrote a piece for business week on me.
[26:37.040 --> 26:42.480]  He was truly John Gruber, which I went along with half-heartedly.
[26:42.480 --> 26:43.480]  I did talk to him.
[26:43.480 --> 26:46.480]  I got thirsty bear when I was in San Francisco.
[26:46.480 --> 26:48.600]  I was here first mistake.
[26:48.600 --> 26:51.000]  I was daytime.
[26:51.000 --> 26:54.640]  And I met with a colleague of his here in Philly for follow-up questions.
[26:54.640 --> 26:58.840]  And it was about what I do, the phenomenon of, it was well, it was posed to me initially
[26:58.840 --> 27:04.120]  as that they were going to write a piece about the independent Mac journalism web.
[27:04.120 --> 27:10.400]  People like me and Arnold Kim, who founded Mac rumors, and maybe Jim Dowrymple and other
[27:10.400 --> 27:13.080]  people like that.
[27:13.080 --> 27:19.960]  People who are covering Apple, but either individuals like me or as new publications
[27:19.960 --> 27:23.360]  like The Loop and Mac rumors.
[27:23.360 --> 27:28.480]  And it became very obvious to me as the interviews progressed that it was not going to be
[27:28.480 --> 27:32.480]  that, that it was more just about me, which I found uncomfortable.
[27:32.480 --> 27:37.200]  And I encouraged them to not make it about me and make it about all of us together, of
[27:37.200 --> 27:41.320]  which I'm just one example.
[27:41.320 --> 27:47.280]  And so I kind of, as that became clear to me, I participated less and less.
[27:47.280 --> 27:54.360]  And I don't think I wasn't rude and I didn't stop talking to them, but I stopped participating.
[27:54.360 --> 28:03.080]  And they asked me to pose for a photograph and I refused, that's awkward.
[28:03.080 --> 28:07.360]  Well, but I've seen the photographs that they had published of others and they made people
[28:07.360 --> 28:11.400]  look goofy like I told them this.
[28:11.400 --> 28:15.400]  So like, what's the guy's name, Gene Munster, who's famously the analyst.
[28:15.400 --> 28:16.400]  TV.
[28:16.400 --> 28:18.960]  Man, I'm pulling for Gene, man.
[28:18.960 --> 28:19.960]  I love that guy.
[28:19.960 --> 28:26.040]  I haven't looked at this one, but see if you Google Gene Munster business, I don't know
[28:26.040 --> 28:29.360]  if I forget, I think it was a business week, but it might have been Bloomberg.
[28:29.360 --> 28:32.560]  But Bloomberg owned the business week.
[28:32.560 --> 28:35.560]  Gene Munster says Apple is going to a thousand bucks.
[28:35.560 --> 28:36.560]  That might be it.
[28:36.560 --> 28:37.560]  No, no, that's in 2012.
[28:37.560 --> 28:42.880]  I don't want to make too much fun if I'm going to get this stock split, so it's just very
[28:42.880 --> 28:43.880]  not fair.
[28:43.880 --> 28:47.600]  It's at 700 now if you don't get it, that's it, though.
[28:47.600 --> 28:48.600]  But that's it.
[28:48.600 --> 28:51.160]  Look at the picture of him.
[28:51.160 --> 28:53.240]  Why would you do this to somebody?
[28:53.240 --> 28:54.240]  Right.
[28:54.240 --> 28:58.560]  It's a very, to me, I think a very unflattering photo.
[28:58.560 --> 29:03.400]  I mean, I think he's goofy because of the TV stuff that he keeps being up, but that don't
[29:03.400 --> 29:04.400]  do that to him.
[29:04.400 --> 29:05.800]  He's smarter than that.
[29:05.800 --> 29:06.800]  Yeah.
[29:06.800 --> 29:08.920]  They make him look like a clown.
[29:08.920 --> 29:09.920]  Yeah.
[29:09.920 --> 29:11.640]  Yeah.
[29:11.640 --> 29:16.520]  And I've seen other publications do this, and I can also, and so I wanted nothing to do
[29:16.520 --> 29:17.520]  with it.
[29:17.520 --> 29:22.080]  But to approve it, it's not like if they shoot 20 photos of me, I get to then pick
[29:22.080 --> 29:23.320]  which one they can use.
[29:23.320 --> 29:24.320]  They're all theirs.
[29:24.320 --> 29:25.320]  Yeah.
[29:25.320 --> 29:27.480]  So let him do it, and I wanted nothing to do with that.
[29:27.480 --> 29:31.280]  Nor would I allow them to use any of the photos I have of me.
[29:31.280 --> 29:34.760]  So they, I think if you look at the profile they had of me, if you Google it, they found
[29:34.760 --> 29:45.040]  like a third party photo, like a creative comments thing from Flickr or something.
[29:45.040 --> 29:49.480]  But anyway, the main point though is that they were then then towards the end, they came
[29:49.480 --> 29:52.560]  out and asked the question, I knew that they were going to ask, which is how much money
[29:52.560 --> 29:54.560]  do you make?
[29:54.560 --> 29:59.040]  And I said to Adam Satoriano on the record, I said, I don't know.
[29:59.040 --> 30:00.640]  I don't keep track.
[30:00.640 --> 30:05.560]  I he paused and he said, really?
[30:05.560 --> 30:08.360]  And I said, really, I don't keep track.
[30:08.360 --> 30:10.400]  And I said off the record and he said, what?
[30:10.400 --> 30:13.880]  And I said, that what you do, what I just told you is what you can quote me on.
[30:13.880 --> 30:18.720]  You can quote the world in business week, I don't know, I don't keep track.
[30:18.720 --> 30:22.720]  And other than that, I'm not going to talk about it.
[30:22.720 --> 30:24.640]  And he, you know, he was like, so I could run that.
[30:24.640 --> 30:26.280]  I said, sure, I would love it if you ran that.
[30:26.280 --> 30:27.520]  I still wish he had run it.
[30:27.520 --> 30:33.800]  But instead, when the thing came out, it said, like, Gruber wouldn't discuss it.
[30:33.800 --> 30:41.080]  But somebody familiar with his finances who can't be with hell, I swear to God, because
[30:41.080 --> 30:46.080]  he doesn't have permission, pegged his income at, I don't know what it was, $400,000.
[30:46.080 --> 30:47.720]  Well, he has a big organization.
[30:47.720 --> 30:49.880]  So I mean, God knows who leaked that.
[30:49.880 --> 30:50.160]  Right.
[30:50.160 --> 30:51.880]  Well, here's the thing that made me so mad about that.
[30:51.880 --> 30:54.400]  And I called Adam on it privately.
[30:54.400 --> 30:56.880]  I didn't not publicly because I didn't want to bring it up because...
[30:56.880 --> 30:58.280]  Until now.
[30:58.280 --> 31:01.840]  Well, I feel like on the talk show, maybe I can do it and it won't be in print.
[31:01.840 --> 31:03.720]  But I said, I know that it's bullshit.
[31:03.720 --> 31:08.520]  I know that it's bullshit because there's literally only three people on the planet who
[31:08.520 --> 31:11.160]  have any familiarity with my finances at all.
[31:11.160 --> 31:14.720]  That's me, my wife, and my accountant.
[31:14.720 --> 31:20.840]  And I guess maybe if there's a fourth, it would be somebody at the IRS who handles the
[31:20.840 --> 31:22.560]  tax return that my accountant submits.
[31:22.560 --> 31:25.360]  But even then, I doubt that there's anybody who remembers my name.
[31:25.360 --> 31:27.560]  I presume that those things are completely automated.
[31:27.560 --> 31:28.560]  Yeah.
[31:28.560 --> 31:29.560]  It's just robots.
[31:29.560 --> 31:30.560]  Yeah.
[31:30.560 --> 31:31.560]  It's just robots.
[31:31.560 --> 31:32.400]  So there's literally only three people on the planet.
[31:32.400 --> 31:39.400]  And I know for a fact that he didn't speak to...
[31:39.400 --> 31:40.400]  Right.
[31:40.400 --> 31:46.000]  So what I presume that I don't think he made it up.
[31:46.000 --> 31:51.720]  I presume that what he did is he found one person who's sponsored my site and asked,
[31:51.720 --> 31:55.600]  you know, what did you pay for the sponsorship and multiplied it or something like that?
[31:55.600 --> 31:56.600]  I don't know.
[31:56.600 --> 31:58.400]  But there's no way that that would qualify...
[31:58.400 --> 32:01.600]  Well, I mean, you present rates on your website, right?
[32:01.600 --> 32:02.600]  Right.
[32:02.600 --> 32:03.600]  But the description...
[32:03.600 --> 32:04.800]  But that's not what he said, though.
[32:04.800 --> 32:05.800]  Yeah.
[32:05.800 --> 32:10.480]  The description he used in print in business week is absolutely incompatible with any way
[32:10.480 --> 32:12.080]  that he could have come up with the number.
[32:12.080 --> 32:13.080]  Yeah.
[32:13.080 --> 32:14.560]  I thought that was so telling about...
[32:14.560 --> 32:15.560]  Well, you know what?
[32:15.560 --> 32:19.800]  It's like, hey kid, get me a coffee, go to this website, find me this number, multiply
[32:19.800 --> 32:20.800]  by 12.
[32:20.800 --> 32:21.800]  Right?
[32:21.800 --> 32:22.800]  It's just dumb.
[32:22.800 --> 32:23.800]  It's just...
[32:23.800 --> 32:24.800]  Right.
[32:24.800 --> 32:25.800]  But I feel like it's dishonest.
[32:25.800 --> 32:26.800]  I feel like that's what he did.
[32:26.800 --> 32:30.680]  Then he should have said in print, you know, he should have spelled that out just like you
[32:30.680 --> 32:33.800]  did in print and said, as a ballpark estimate, there you go.
[32:33.800 --> 32:34.800]  Yeah.
[32:34.800 --> 32:35.800]  No.
[32:35.800 --> 32:39.000]  But what he said was that somebody familiar with my finances who didn't have...
[32:39.000 --> 32:44.040]  Which it's made me mad in two ways because the first way is that it's...
[32:44.040 --> 32:45.120]  I know it's not true.
[32:45.120 --> 32:48.360]  But the second way is that insinuates that there's somebody who's close to me who betrayed
[32:48.360 --> 32:51.720]  me, which is even more angering.
[32:51.720 --> 32:52.720]  Yeah.
[32:52.720 --> 32:53.720]  That...
[32:53.720 --> 32:54.720]  Yeah.
[32:54.720 --> 32:56.840]  I hadn't even thought of it like that.
[32:56.840 --> 32:57.840]  Yeah.
[32:57.840 --> 32:59.320]  That was like my secondary reaction.
[32:59.320 --> 33:01.800]  And in fact, that actually bothered me even more.
[33:01.800 --> 33:06.680]  That somebody that I would share my finances with somebody and that they would blab off
[33:06.680 --> 33:09.840]  the record to Adam Satturiano at Business Week, which did not matter.
[33:09.840 --> 33:10.840]  Why would you...
[33:10.840 --> 33:11.840]  Right.
[33:11.840 --> 33:12.840]  Yeah.
[33:12.840 --> 33:13.840]  So it always...
[33:13.840 --> 33:15.960]  And I always file that in my head whenever I see...
[33:15.960 --> 33:21.840]  I've always been a little bit skeptical of any unnamed sources in any thing I read online.
[33:21.840 --> 33:26.760]  But after that, I'm even more so when I see information attributed to people familiar
[33:26.760 --> 33:27.760]  with the matter.
[33:27.760 --> 33:28.760]  Yeah.
[33:28.760 --> 33:29.760]  But...
[33:29.760 --> 33:30.760]  Right.
[33:30.760 --> 33:31.760]  Yeah.
[33:31.760 --> 33:32.760]  I agree with you.
[33:32.760 --> 33:35.400]  I've rejected that intellectually.
[33:35.400 --> 33:40.680]  But this is like a visual rejection, you know?
[33:40.680 --> 33:41.680]  Right.
[33:41.680 --> 33:46.320]  Just being your pal, I know that no, nobody would do that.
[33:46.320 --> 33:47.720]  I don't understand.
[33:47.720 --> 33:48.720]  Yeah.
[33:48.720 --> 33:51.680]  I'm not a fan of Adam Satturiano's work.
[33:51.680 --> 33:58.040]  So he out of this guy at QA and I think that was a hack job and whatever.
[33:58.040 --> 34:00.520]  Pointless.
[34:00.520 --> 34:01.520]  We got...
[34:01.520 --> 34:06.160]  We off track because I was telling you why putting out an OS every year is kind of a pain
[34:06.160 --> 34:07.160]  in the ass.
[34:07.160 --> 34:08.160]  Right.
[34:08.160 --> 34:11.200]  At least three months after the OS comes out, you're fixing bugs.
[34:11.200 --> 34:12.200]  Minimum.
[34:12.200 --> 34:18.720]  And, you know, during that time, hopefully the management is trying to discern which of the
[34:18.720 --> 34:23.480]  major features that are going to be able to make it into the next release.
[34:23.480 --> 34:29.720]  And then you've got maybe, you know, between, if you're lucky, three to six months to
[34:29.720 --> 34:31.400]  implement them.
[34:31.400 --> 34:32.400]  If you're lucky.
[34:32.400 --> 34:33.400]  And then...
[34:33.400 --> 34:36.240]  More or less, squeeze it in for WWDC.
[34:36.240 --> 34:37.240]  Yeah.
[34:37.240 --> 34:38.240]  Because you need to get...
[34:38.240 --> 34:43.400]  I don't know what, you know, what's the December-January timeline for, you know, last year,
[34:43.400 --> 34:44.400]  what do you call it?
[34:44.400 --> 34:46.480]  7.1 didn't come out until March.
[34:46.480 --> 34:47.480]  Yeah.
[34:47.480 --> 34:51.880]  But figure, I figured just as a rough timeline that through December, it was mostly
[34:51.880 --> 34:56.120]  heads down on fixing stuff and doing stuff for 7.1.
[34:56.120 --> 35:00.760]  January and February, I'm sure a lot of resources started going towards the iOS 8.
[35:00.760 --> 35:04.840]  But some was still finishing the final touches on 7.1.
[35:04.840 --> 35:05.840]  Yeah.
[35:05.840 --> 35:10.960]  But then roughly, you know, up until June, you're trying to get the first working version
[35:10.960 --> 35:14.320]  of new stuff done for the next version of the OS.
[35:14.320 --> 35:15.320]  Right.
[35:15.320 --> 35:23.080]  I mean, yeah, so I'm hesitant to peg them months to certain phases.
[35:23.080 --> 35:24.080]  Right.
[35:24.080 --> 35:29.080]  Because, you know, I think that's fluid, but, you know, the general process is that
[35:29.080 --> 35:34.800]  you'll get, if you're lucky, three to six months to actually implement stuff and the
[35:34.800 --> 35:40.240]  rest of the time, you know, at the end, you will be fixing everything that you find
[35:40.240 --> 35:47.240]  after you have released it as a beta, which is what WWC is, right?
[35:47.240 --> 35:48.240]  Right.
[35:48.240 --> 35:54.520]  And so that means that anyone given release has really only had, if you're lucky, three
[35:54.520 --> 36:00.640]  to six months of actual development time in terms of implementing new features, which is
[36:00.640 --> 36:05.160]  yeah, like creating, you know, create the creative phase of software development.
[36:05.160 --> 36:06.160]  That's the best way of putting it.
[36:06.160 --> 36:08.200]  Yes, I tell the great.
[36:08.200 --> 36:18.160]  And so having this yearly schedule becomes onerous if you keep trying to bite off giant,
[36:18.160 --> 36:20.840]  you know, portions of the pie.
[36:20.840 --> 36:25.960]  And if you know what you want to build, and I believe that Apple probably has like a
[36:25.960 --> 36:30.640]  build line that goes out, you know, a couple of versions at least or at least they have
[36:30.640 --> 36:38.160]  aspirations, you're doing so only in chunks of three to six months of, like,
[36:38.160 --> 36:44.160]  a pure creative engineering, the rest of the time is spilling, dealing with the bugs you
[36:44.160 --> 36:47.640]  created in the previous version and the bugs that you're fixing in order to get the current
[36:47.640 --> 36:51.120]  version out the door.
[36:51.120 --> 37:00.920]  And I, you know, I think ultimately what they want to get out the door may be lining up
[37:00.920 --> 37:04.720]  against the limits of what they can achieve in that timeframe.
[37:04.720 --> 37:08.160]  Yeah, I totally agree with that.
[37:08.160 --> 37:09.800]  And I think they've compounded the problem.
[37:09.800 --> 37:15.440]  I mean, this all sounds very negative, but I mean, they've got Mac OS 10, they've got
[37:15.440 --> 37:22.960]  iOS and now they've got the watch OS, all of them increasingly have to work together.
[37:22.960 --> 37:30.240]  That's, stuff's going to take time, I think maybe I think there will be difficulties
[37:30.240 --> 37:33.400]  down the road trying to iron all of this stuff out.
[37:33.400 --> 37:38.520]  There's a lot of, I don't know, bootstrapping is quite the right word, but it's, you know,
[37:38.520 --> 37:43.560]  almost like gear fitting where, you know, with the way that these things are integrated
[37:43.560 --> 37:47.720]  with each other, which is great and which is the way to go and which is better than the
[37:47.720 --> 37:53.080]  way that everything used to be a lot more siloed from Apple.
[37:53.080 --> 37:58.120]  But the fact that it's all geared together creates these weird hiccups when one of the
[37:58.120 --> 38:00.120]  gears isn't ready yet, right?
[38:00.120 --> 38:07.160]  I mean, just one example, but I think it's a major one is the photo situation with iOS.
[38:07.160 --> 38:08.160]  Right.
[38:08.160 --> 38:11.920]  Where are your photos and where are they, how many are backed up and the ones that, you
[38:11.920 --> 38:18.000]  know, to the iCloud and the fact, I mean, they're not even trying it with the, even
[38:18.000 --> 38:22.240]  with when Yosemite ships, the new Mac photo stuff, they've already said they said back
[38:22.240 --> 38:27.280]  at WWDC that that wasn't coming till 2015, you know, in terms of having the Mac be
[38:27.280 --> 38:32.080]  a full client towards this new iCloud centric look.
[38:32.080 --> 38:33.080]  Yeah.
[38:33.080 --> 38:40.320]  And I heard it suggested that they were doing it in Swift and they, it's not, it just takes
[38:40.320 --> 38:42.280]  out a lot to do that kind of app.
[38:42.280 --> 38:44.000]  Right.
[38:44.000 --> 38:48.800]  And that they know that because they have, they do have some experience with, and it's
[38:48.800 --> 38:50.280]  always hard to estimate exactly.
[38:50.280 --> 38:53.560]  It's impossible to estimate exactly how long software is going to take to write.
[38:53.560 --> 38:56.680]  But they know how long it took to write iPhone and they know how long it took to write
[38:56.680 --> 39:01.080]  aperture and they know how long a major update to aperture took and how long a major update
[39:01.080 --> 39:02.080]  to iPhoto took.
[39:02.080 --> 39:05.880]  And they knew that what they were undertaking with this is, you know, in that scope, and
[39:05.880 --> 39:10.880]  they know that, you know, that's, that's a nine, 10 months away thing.
[39:10.880 --> 39:17.440]  But it's such a big hole in the process, you know, in the overall experience right now
[39:17.440 --> 39:23.000]  that nobody quite knows where their photos are and how to make sure that they're everywhere.
[39:23.000 --> 39:26.560]  Yeah, I think they're lucky that they were ahead.
[39:26.560 --> 39:27.560]  Not lucky.
[39:27.560 --> 39:28.560]  They worked hard.
[39:28.560 --> 39:30.240]  They were ahead.
[39:30.240 --> 39:35.040]  This kind of weird little, you know, as you describe it, the cogs not maybe meeting up
[39:35.040 --> 39:41.560]  exactly in this little bit of a kind, you know, I think that's expected.
[39:41.560 --> 39:44.240]  And I don't think it's necessarily cause for alarm.
[39:44.240 --> 39:45.240]  Right.
[39:45.240 --> 39:50.720]  I think institutionally they're going to have to sort of adapt to this kind of interconnected
[39:50.720 --> 39:54.200]  stuff that they're committing to.
[39:54.200 --> 39:57.040]  And again, you mentioned this on your show last week.
[39:57.040 --> 40:00.880]  And I think it's another point I took a note that it's worth pointing out and just saying
[40:00.880 --> 40:04.360]  it like, hey, look, we're literally armchair quarterbacks here.
[40:04.360 --> 40:11.000]  We're just two guys, you know, I think they're not joke, but yeah, we're just two guys,
[40:11.000 --> 40:16.400]  you know, observing from across the continent and inside Apple, their leadership is running
[40:16.400 --> 40:23.160]  a $100 billion a year corporation, you know, and we're not, I'm not trying to tell them
[40:23.160 --> 40:24.160]  I know better.
[40:24.160 --> 40:28.520]  I'm just, just keep doing good stuff, don't like, yeah.
[40:28.520 --> 40:32.320]  But I'm just saying though, as an observer, if we want to just take a step back and look
[40:32.320 --> 40:38.200]  at the state that the whole software ecosystem is across the Apple board right now, it's
[40:38.200 --> 40:42.720]  not good right now in September, October, 2014.
[40:42.720 --> 40:46.680]  Rough spot. Yeah, and last year was very similar.
[40:46.680 --> 40:52.000]  Yeah, I thought yeah, I mean, last year, last year, I think a lot of us chalk chalked
[40:52.000 --> 40:57.480]  it up to, well, I was 70 to change it forced all being gone, right.
[40:57.480 --> 41:00.760]  So that's going to be boot the process and they didn't really have a much time.
[41:00.760 --> 41:01.760]  Right.
[41:01.760 --> 41:05.880]  And that those of us who know how long stuff takes were still and still to this day,
[41:05.880 --> 41:11.080]  I'm kind of in awe that they shipped iOS seven as, even though as rough as it was in
[41:11.080 --> 41:15.640]  a short of time as they did, knowing should not have happened, right, knowing that it really
[41:15.640 --> 41:21.440]  didn't start until after four stalls ousted, you know, late in late in the year 2012.
[41:21.440 --> 41:25.720]  Well, I think some of the technical end of pinning stayed, but certainly the B design was
[41:25.720 --> 41:26.720]  new.
[41:26.720 --> 41:32.280]  Yeah, and some of the noodleings of the design had started, yeah, but, but as a look, we're
[41:32.280 --> 41:36.920]  going to actually do this and we actually need to take this style of design and apply it
[41:36.920 --> 41:43.720]  to everything, hop to bottom, didn't start until the four-stalled ouster and re re jigging
[41:43.720 --> 41:48.760]  of the, you know, John, putting Johnny I've in front of, in charge of all design software
[41:48.760 --> 41:56.360]  and hardware and putting, putting, what's his name in charge of software engineering?
[41:56.360 --> 42:06.800]  Mr. Lee, the hair, yeah, check for a new key, yeah, in charge of, you know, the engineering.
[42:06.800 --> 42:08.040]  That's an incredible time frame.
[42:08.040 --> 42:12.720]  And so we, I think we, we as like observers and critics of the company, we're willing
[42:12.720 --> 42:19.040]  to grant a little bit more grace last year with Iowa seven bugginess until Iowa 7-1, whereas
[42:19.040 --> 42:23.840]  this year it doesn't really seem, it seems like an own goal, like a four, an unforced
[42:23.840 --> 42:24.840]  error.
[42:24.840 --> 42:25.840]  Yeah.
[42:25.840 --> 42:26.840]  It didn't necessarily.
[42:26.840 --> 42:27.840]  Double, right?
[42:27.840 --> 42:28.840]  Double's forced metaphor.
[42:28.840 --> 42:29.840]  Yeah.
[42:29.840 --> 42:30.840]  Double's forced metaphor.
[42:30.840 --> 42:31.840]  I'll go unforced error.
[42:31.840 --> 42:32.840]  I'll take the own goal.
[42:32.840 --> 42:36.880]  Or as too drastic, it's more like an unforced error that they didn't quite have to do as much
[42:36.880 --> 42:38.800]  of this as they needed to all at once.
[42:38.800 --> 42:43.600]  They didn't have to do third party keyboards right now, right?
[42:43.600 --> 42:47.560]  Well, didn't they, I mean, I don't know.
[42:47.560 --> 42:50.960]  I don't personally, no, I don't think so, I'm probably not going to use a lot of those
[42:50.960 --> 42:51.960]  keyboards.
[42:51.960 --> 42:55.600]  Well, I just don't think they needed to do it yet, you know, I mean, I think in hindsight,
[42:55.600 --> 42:56.600]  you know, but again.
[42:56.600 --> 43:01.480]  But you know, you know, you know, you know, you know the press better than I do.
[43:01.480 --> 43:03.440]  Do you think that would have been called out?
[43:03.440 --> 43:08.080]  Iowa still does not support swipe, which I think so, right?
[43:08.080 --> 43:13.560]  I do think I do think that there was, you know, there's this weird, I mean, the news
[43:13.560 --> 43:15.040]  cycle is always screwed up, right?
[43:15.040 --> 43:16.440]  Like the bending phones.
[43:16.440 --> 43:17.440]  Yeah.
[43:17.440 --> 43:21.600]  I do think that, you know, I firmly believe I've said this for years.
[43:21.600 --> 43:25.520]  And I think, you know, people outside, you can kind of tell like just chill or alone
[43:25.520 --> 43:31.400]  is not, he's not just there to do ads, you know, that no, no, he's not.
[43:31.400 --> 43:34.080]  Like marketing, I think it's a bad rap.
[43:34.080 --> 43:38.400]  And there might be some companies that do it this way, but that, you know, somebody
[43:38.400 --> 43:42.440]  creates the product, there's an insert tied to company, designs, whatever it is, and engineers
[43:42.440 --> 43:44.040]  make it and it becomes real.
[43:44.040 --> 43:48.280]  And then it's finished and then they hand it to marketing and they say, now sell it.
[43:48.280 --> 43:52.200]  That's not how marketing works at Apple and it's not how it works at most companies.
[43:52.200 --> 43:55.360]  Marketing is just describing what the product is.
[43:55.360 --> 44:00.080]  And marketing is part of the design process of making sure that it fills a need and that
[44:00.080 --> 44:04.520]  it's going to sell before it's made, you know, it's, yeah, I mean, I was just talking
[44:04.520 --> 44:11.560]  to a kneading canatra and Don Melton yesterday, because I'm going to name John.
[44:11.560 --> 44:16.440]  And I mean, they were both, they were both being in meetings with Phil.
[44:16.440 --> 44:20.320]  And no, it's very much part of the design process, like this is not working the way
[44:20.320 --> 44:26.720]  I'd like it to work, go make it work better, like this is failing me in these kind of ways.
[44:26.720 --> 44:30.680]  It's, it's part of the process, like they're built in from the beginning.
[44:30.680 --> 44:35.280]  And then at the end of the process, when it is time to come up with actual slogans and
[44:35.280 --> 44:41.200]  the billboards and here's the way we're going to present it on stage at the intro event,
[44:41.200 --> 44:46.280]  you're just, they're just describing what it actually is, like, and I think that's very,
[44:46.280 --> 44:51.360]  very true of almost all Apple products is that the marketing really is pretty apt.
[44:51.360 --> 44:57.200]  Well, you know why I think because marketing has been, and marketing is a horrible word,
[44:57.200 --> 45:01.280]  I wish I wish there was a better word for it, because it's, it's been stained too often.
[45:01.280 --> 45:05.520]  Yeah, yeah, well, yeah, it's not inherently bad, bad word.
[45:05.520 --> 45:09.920]  And now, but from like a geek culture, it's like our marketing, it's like lighter people.
[45:09.920 --> 45:12.160]  No, no, it's not always that.
[45:12.160 --> 45:17.040]  Um, I had the same conversation this week on Twitter with the Neil Dash and Gina
[45:17.040 --> 45:21.560]  Tripani at ThinkUp, they were the sponsors of Darren Fireball last week and that they're,
[45:21.560 --> 45:24.760]  they're ThinkUp thing they described as social network analytics.
[45:24.760 --> 45:28.400]  And on Twitter, or even in my write up on Darren Fireball, I said, look, analytics is a
[45:28.400 --> 45:29.400]  solid word.
[45:29.400 --> 45:30.400]  Yeah.
[45:30.400 --> 45:31.400]  Don't think of it that way.
[45:31.400 --> 45:34.240]  It's just useful information about you that you would want to know.
[45:34.240 --> 45:36.720]  And it's not like for douchebags.
[45:36.720 --> 45:40.840]  And then Neil even said that it's like internally, like they, he knows they couldn't
[45:40.840 --> 45:45.040]  say it, but that they, he thought of his slogan like, it's social analytics, but we swear
[45:45.040 --> 45:47.760]  it's not douchey.
[45:47.760 --> 45:48.760]  Because it's it.
[45:48.760 --> 45:51.680]  And again, there's nothing inherently wrong with the word analytics, technically, literally
[45:51.680 --> 45:54.200]  by the definition, that is what ThinkUp does.
[45:54.200 --> 45:58.800]  And that is what, you know, marketing is, you know, it is what it says it is, but the word
[45:58.800 --> 46:04.000]  is just taken on a bad connotation over the, yeah, no, that's, that's great advice.
[46:04.000 --> 46:05.000]  Couples.
[46:05.000 --> 46:06.000]  Right.
[46:06.000 --> 46:07.000]  Right.
[46:07.000 --> 46:11.120]  And I totally understand that one of the marketing stamps for iOS eight this year.
[46:11.120 --> 46:16.440]  Well, not just iOS eight, it goes hand in hand with the fact that the iPhones six or bigger
[46:16.440 --> 46:19.280]  is it's the shut up about Android year.
[46:19.280 --> 46:20.280]  Right.
[46:20.280 --> 46:21.280]  Right.
[46:21.280 --> 46:28.480]  Like, like, or, or maybe that's a bad way to put it, but it's the, here's the things that
[46:28.480 --> 46:34.520]  here, here's the, the reasonable reasons that somebody might choose Android over iPhone.
[46:34.520 --> 46:37.320]  Here will, will give you our answer on them, right?
[46:37.320 --> 46:39.760]  So you like bigger phones.
[46:39.760 --> 46:40.760]  Totally reasonable.
[46:40.760 --> 46:41.760]  Okay.
[46:41.760 --> 46:42.760]  Okay.
[46:42.760 --> 46:43.760]  Now we have bigger phones.
[46:43.760 --> 46:44.760]  You like third party keyboards.
[46:44.760 --> 46:45.760]  Okay.
[46:45.760 --> 46:46.760]  Now we have third party keyboards.
[46:46.760 --> 46:51.920]  You like sharing information directly between applications and, you know, doing that, you
[46:51.920 --> 46:56.920]  know, and it is, it's all the big highlight, most of the big highlight features are these
[46:56.920 --> 46:59.840]  sort of things that Android had gotten to first.
[46:59.840 --> 47:00.840]  Yeah.
[47:00.840 --> 47:01.840]  Okay.
[47:01.840 --> 47:06.680]  Even Windows phone have, you know, taken it by that of that stuff.
[47:06.680 --> 47:07.680]  Yeah.
[47:07.680 --> 47:08.680]  Yeah.
[47:08.680 --> 47:13.760]  So sharing between applications was, you know, I, I, I know Android had some stuff first,
[47:13.760 --> 47:18.960]  but I thought the way that Windows did it was, was more of a, or it's hardly enough.
[47:18.960 --> 47:20.600]  It was closer to Apple.
[47:20.600 --> 47:21.600]  Yeah.
[47:21.600 --> 47:26.400]  It was a lot more like, yeah, Apple's, well, services in Mac OS 10, you know, it's
[47:26.400 --> 47:31.880]  just taken Apple, you know, all these literally decades to get back around to services
[47:31.880 --> 47:34.200]  from a, you know why.
[47:34.200 --> 47:39.200]  So for instance, I'll stomp on the idea of services in OS iOS.
[47:39.200 --> 47:40.200]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[47:40.200 --> 47:43.200]  Oh, you did know that because you haven't heard the show yet.
[47:43.200 --> 47:45.200]  Neaton was just talking about it yesterday.
[47:45.200 --> 47:46.200]  Ooh.
[47:46.200 --> 47:47.200]  And folks.
[47:47.200 --> 47:49.480]  Well, not out.
[47:49.480 --> 47:54.800]  It was because if every single app that exposed the service as OS 10 does, you would just
[47:54.800 --> 47:57.800]  have it look at completely unwieldy services menu.
[47:57.800 --> 47:58.800]  Oh, yeah.
[47:58.800 --> 47:59.800]  Well, that's a great point.
[47:59.800 --> 48:00.800]  Oh, I see.
[48:00.800 --> 48:01.800]  I see services.
[48:01.800 --> 48:02.800]  I literally do that.
[48:02.800 --> 48:08.520]  Really, actually, because, I mean, they have a PSBOARD server in iOS, like it, iOS works
[48:08.520 --> 48:12.800]  incredibly similarly to the way the Mac does.
[48:12.800 --> 48:13.800]  Yeah.
[48:13.800 --> 48:17.800]  If you know how to implement services, it's really pretty basic.
[48:17.800 --> 48:22.160]  It's like something goes on a PSBOARD, not the one that you copy and paste into, but
[48:22.160 --> 48:24.080]  separate one.
[48:24.080 --> 48:28.640]  Another app can then is invoked and it pulls something off that PSBOARD.
[48:28.640 --> 48:33.160]  It does something with it and it pastes it, it copies it back up to the PSBOARD.
[48:33.160 --> 48:36.880]  And then the app that you call it from just takes that from the
[48:36.880 --> 48:38.160]  PSBOARD and puts it in the app.
[48:38.160 --> 48:41.600]  It is, if you can do copy and paste, you can do services.
[48:41.600 --> 48:42.600]  Yeah.
[48:42.600 --> 48:46.520]  And it's just a very basic little specification of here's the data type, here's the standard
[48:46.520 --> 48:50.480]  data types, four services, and here are the ones I'm interested in.
[48:50.480 --> 48:51.480]  Dead symbol.
[48:51.480 --> 48:52.480]  Exactly.
[48:52.480 --> 48:54.440]  Me as a service, I might only be interested in text.
[48:54.440 --> 48:55.440]  Yeah.
[48:55.440 --> 48:57.320]  So don't even bother with me if the selection is something else.
[48:57.320 --> 48:58.320]  Yeah.
[48:58.320 --> 49:06.800]  And the idea got, well, they didn't want to put it into iOS because the model, the interaction
[49:06.800 --> 49:09.680]  model would just eventually become cumbersome with so many apps.
[49:09.680 --> 49:13.320]  Well, and you can see it on Mac OS 10, if you have enough third party apps.
[49:13.320 --> 49:14.320]  Yeah.
[49:14.320 --> 49:15.320]  So ready to do it.
[49:15.320 --> 49:16.320]  And nobody looks at that menu.
[49:16.320 --> 49:19.640]  I mean, you and I do, and maybe it's some portion of your listeners, but it's a power
[49:19.640 --> 49:20.640]  user feature.
[49:20.640 --> 49:21.640]  Oh, sure.
[49:21.640 --> 49:22.640]  Definitely is.
[49:22.640 --> 49:26.760]  And it's always been and will always be, and unless they totally revolutionize it, like
[49:26.760 --> 49:27.760]  with extensions.
[49:27.760 --> 49:28.760]  Yeah.
[49:28.760 --> 49:32.920]  I mean, so my app implements a couple of services, I imagine if, you know, when you ship
[49:32.920 --> 49:36.280]  Vesper for the Mac, I imagine you'll have a service.
[49:36.280 --> 49:37.280]  Right.
[49:37.280 --> 49:43.600]  But I think you'll be surprised at how few people use it, but it kind of needs to be there
[49:43.600 --> 49:47.160]  just because the people who do use it will definitely want to put it in their work.
[49:47.160 --> 49:49.320]  Yes, because we appreciate these kind of people.
[49:49.320 --> 49:53.760]  And you can go into, and it's so weird, it's like you'd never think to look there.
[49:53.760 --> 50:00.080]  You have to go to system preference, is it on the Mac, system preferences, keyboards,
[50:00.080 --> 50:07.760]  shortcuts, services, and there you get a list of all of the services from all of the apps
[50:07.760 --> 50:08.760]  you have installed.
[50:08.760 --> 50:12.160]  And then you can turn off the ones you don't use.
[50:12.160 --> 50:17.160]  And it's so like, who would ever think that you would go there to manage the system services,
[50:17.160 --> 50:21.760]  go keyboard shortcuts, services, it's just such a weird hit.
[50:21.760 --> 50:23.760]  And it is a giant list.
[50:23.760 --> 50:24.760]  It's kind of crazy.
[50:24.760 --> 50:25.760]  Yeah.
[50:25.760 --> 50:29.040]  And it's also a mess, too, because the service can specify its own keyboard shortcut,
[50:29.040 --> 50:31.480]  but there's nothing that stops to services from everything.
[50:31.480 --> 50:32.480]  Completely.
[50:32.480 --> 50:38.160]  People are shortcuts, and there's no good, no good way to resolve that.
[50:38.160 --> 50:39.160]  I don't know what the rules are.
[50:39.160 --> 50:40.800]  It's like, one of them somehow wins.
[50:40.800 --> 50:43.960]  I don't know if it's the first one to claim it or the last one to claim it, but one of
[50:43.960 --> 50:47.200]  them wins, but it's not because you, the user chose it.
[50:47.200 --> 50:49.360]  You can't order the first or the last one.
[50:49.360 --> 50:55.440]  So it's, I would imagine, it's the last one that the system notices and registers, but
[50:55.440 --> 50:56.440]  completely arbitrary.
[50:56.440 --> 51:02.440]  Anyway, so long story short, yeah, the idea of services got next in iOS.
[51:02.440 --> 51:08.520]  And I thought you meant when I, when I, when I tooth sucked before and said, ouch, I thought
[51:08.520 --> 51:12.200]  you meant the idea of like extensions for iOS.
[51:12.200 --> 51:13.200]  No, no, no.
[51:13.200 --> 51:15.680]  You're saying, literally, literally services.
[51:15.680 --> 51:16.680]  Right.
[51:16.680 --> 51:17.680]  Yeah.
[51:17.680 --> 51:19.200]  And that's forced all that as best.
[51:19.200 --> 51:20.520]  I think so too.
[51:20.520 --> 51:25.520]  And I, I, I, I imagine this part will make the show, we're going to have to edit that
[51:25.520 --> 51:30.880]  because I think, I think some stuff got said that probably shouldn't have got said, or
[51:30.880 --> 51:34.160]  at least publicly.
[51:34.160 --> 51:40.480]  I, I think that that was forced all that as best because he's an old next guy.
[51:40.480 --> 51:45.800]  And services were kind of a feather in the cap of the next system, and for him to be like,
[51:45.800 --> 51:49.120]  no, screw this, we really don't want to go down this rabbit hole.
[51:49.120 --> 51:50.120]  Yeah.
[51:50.120 --> 51:53.440]  And I think he was, I think he had his eyes open enough to see that it didn't play out well
[51:53.440 --> 51:55.440]  on Mac OS 10.
[51:55.440 --> 52:00.800]  And I think part of the reason it didn't play out as well on Mac OS 10 as next is that
[52:00.800 --> 52:03.560]  next never really had a lot of developers.
[52:03.560 --> 52:08.320]  They had like some and some, the ones that they had, even the third party ones were amazing,
[52:08.320 --> 52:09.320]  right?
[52:09.320 --> 52:10.320]  Almi group is still around.
[52:10.320 --> 52:15.760]  Almi group started, you know, they were the, you know, fantastic company.
[52:15.760 --> 52:19.520]  There weren't, you know, people with next computers were never complaining about how long
[52:19.520 --> 52:23.880]  their services menu was because all the apps were providing all these services that didn't
[52:23.880 --> 52:24.880]  have that many apps.
[52:24.880 --> 52:30.120]  That is exactly what I mean, said he's like, there's like five apps out there.
[52:30.120 --> 52:33.400]  Don't want everybody to like, it's not an ass not an issue.
[52:33.400 --> 52:34.400]  Try it on the iPhone.
[52:34.400 --> 52:37.440]  It's like, oh my God, I'm going to be scrolling for like three weeks trying to figure
[52:37.440 --> 52:40.400]  out like where the services are they want.
[52:40.400 --> 52:41.400]  Right.
[52:41.400 --> 52:45.760]  And I, when I upgraded to iOS eight, I took the time and like deleted all the apps that
[52:45.760 --> 52:49.880]  I hadn't used and I figured if I haven't used it in a more than a month, just delete
[52:49.880 --> 52:50.880]  it.
[52:50.880 --> 52:53.240]  And if I really ever want it back, I can just go to the app store and get it back.
[52:53.240 --> 52:55.680]  I wish I had, it's got so many apps on there.
[52:55.680 --> 53:00.000]  And I still have so many apps, you know, and there's so much like, oh, I haven't used it,
[53:00.000 --> 53:01.160]  but I still, I like that game.
[53:01.160 --> 53:02.160]  So maybe I'll keep it.
[53:02.160 --> 53:03.240]  But anyway, I still have so many apps.
[53:03.240 --> 53:05.240]  I can't even imagine how long my services menu would be.
[53:05.240 --> 53:06.240]  Yeah.
[53:06.240 --> 53:09.000]  Well, I mean, I'm matching you just install apps to try them, right?
[53:09.000 --> 53:10.000]  Yeah.
[53:10.000 --> 53:11.000]  And I do the same thing.
[53:11.000 --> 53:12.000]  Okay.
[53:12.000 --> 53:13.560]  And it's a lot easier to just leave them around the next.
[53:13.560 --> 53:14.560]  Exactly.
[53:14.560 --> 53:15.560]  I just can't be bothered.
[53:15.560 --> 53:18.080]  I literally have grind around my app and I'm a straight male.
[53:18.080 --> 53:19.560]  So I don't know.
[53:19.560 --> 53:20.560]  I don't.
[53:20.560 --> 53:26.240]  It's like every now and then somebody notices and like, I just, I needed to see what the
[53:26.240 --> 53:29.040]  UI was because people were talking about this app all the time.
[53:29.040 --> 53:34.200]  That's just, just in case you think, yeah, I'm curious, who knows.
[53:34.200 --> 53:35.200]  Maybe I'll get drunk.
[53:35.200 --> 53:36.200]  I don't know.
[53:36.200 --> 53:37.200]  Yeah.
[53:37.200 --> 53:40.920]  I've got, I've got Tinder too, which I also never use.
[53:40.920 --> 53:41.920]  It's just awkward.
[53:41.920 --> 53:43.680]  There's, I've got period trackers too.
[53:43.680 --> 53:48.720]  Like there's absolutely a phone that I cannot explain to anybody except that like somebody
[53:48.720 --> 53:53.280]  told me it was a good app to just see this kind of particular interaction with something.
[53:53.280 --> 53:54.280]  Okay.
[53:54.280 --> 53:55.280]  I'll buy it and try it out.
[53:55.280 --> 53:56.280]  Yeah.
[53:56.280 --> 53:57.280]  Wisconsin.
[53:57.280 --> 53:58.280]  I do that a lot.
[53:58.280 --> 54:03.760]  Just if one of the spots in app that has an interesting interaction, we'll buy the app just just
[54:03.760 --> 54:10.520]  to see like a good, oh, you should see the way that you can reorder lists in this app.
[54:10.520 --> 54:11.520]  You don't have to hit at it first.
[54:11.520 --> 54:12.520]  You just, you know, do this.
[54:12.520 --> 54:13.520]  Yeah.
[54:13.520 --> 54:14.520]  Some weird kind of thing.
[54:14.520 --> 54:15.520]  Yeah.
[54:15.520 --> 54:16.520]  Like what, like a long press and that you reorder?
[54:16.520 --> 54:17.520]  Yeah.
[54:17.520 --> 54:18.520]  Yeah.
[54:18.520 --> 54:19.520]  Yeah.
[54:19.520 --> 54:20.520]  And then, but like what the app actually does is something that's, yeah.
[54:20.520 --> 54:21.520]  Who cares what it is.
[54:21.520 --> 54:22.520]  Right.
[54:22.520 --> 54:25.520]  It's like, it might be managing your, you know, your glucose levels for diabetes.
[54:25.520 --> 54:26.520]  I don't have diabetes.
[54:26.520 --> 54:27.520]  Yeah.
[54:27.520 --> 54:28.520]  Yeah.
[54:28.520 --> 54:29.520]  Something like that.
[54:29.520 --> 54:30.520]  Anyway, this is a take a break.
[54:30.520 --> 54:33.520]  I'll thank our second sponsor, Grindr.
[54:33.520 --> 54:34.520]  No.
[54:34.520 --> 54:35.520]  No.
[54:35.520 --> 54:36.520]  No.
[54:36.520 --> 54:37.520]  No.
[54:37.520 --> 54:38.520]  Knock on there.
[54:38.520 --> 54:39.520]  No.
[54:39.520 --> 54:40.520]  Yeah.
[54:40.520 --> 54:41.520]  Yeah.
[54:41.520 --> 54:42.520]  But it's not our sponsor.
[54:42.520 --> 54:43.520]  It is back place.
[54:43.520 --> 54:45.520]  Our good friends at back place.
[54:45.520 --> 54:47.520]  I have a great story to tell.
[54:47.520 --> 54:48.520]  This is amazing.
[54:48.520 --> 54:53.520]  This is, we are recording on Tuesday, October 7th.
[54:53.520 --> 54:55.520]  Last night, Monday, October 6th.
[54:55.520 --> 55:01.520]  My main Mac fan was on real loud at my desk.
[55:01.520 --> 55:04.520]  My wife was going to record her podcast.
[55:04.520 --> 55:05.520]  And I, you know what?
[55:05.520 --> 55:07.520]  I checked the uptime and it was like 14 days.
[55:07.520 --> 55:08.520]  I was like, oh, that's a long time to run it.
[55:08.520 --> 55:09.520]  This thing.
[55:09.520 --> 55:10.520]  I'll just restart.
[55:10.520 --> 55:16.520]  So I restarted the Mac and to let it sit at that login screen and just shut up and let
[55:16.520 --> 55:17.520]  the fan go off.
[55:17.520 --> 55:21.520]  So when she records it, my desk, because that's where the microphone is.
[55:21.520 --> 55:23.520]  And it's recorded her podcast.
[55:23.520 --> 55:26.520]  Just the tip with the podcast.
[55:26.520 --> 55:28.520]  Good podcast.
[55:28.520 --> 55:29.520]  P.K.
[55:29.520 --> 55:31.520]  I came back after watching the baseball game.
[55:31.520 --> 55:35.520]  And I wanted to get my computer restart and get it Safari back on.
[55:35.520 --> 55:38.520]  And I ended up, wouldn't restart.
[55:38.520 --> 55:39.520]  And I thought, oh, and I look.
[55:39.520 --> 55:43.520]  And I like hit the power button, held the power button, shut down, and held the power
[55:43.520 --> 55:44.520]  button again.
[55:44.520 --> 55:45.520]  And I heard a little something starting up.
[55:45.520 --> 55:46.520]  And a light came on.
[55:46.520 --> 55:49.520]  But it never even got to the startup time.
[55:49.520 --> 55:51.520]  Which is a very bad sign.
[55:51.520 --> 55:54.520]  If you don't, if you don't hear that bomb when you start your Mac.
[55:54.520 --> 55:56.520]  If you don't get past the post.
[55:56.520 --> 56:03.520]  That's a very, you could, you should bet money that you have a logic board problem.
[56:03.520 --> 56:06.520]  I thought, fuck.
[56:06.520 --> 56:08.520]  And then I thought, you know what?
[56:08.520 --> 56:09.520]  I know I'm backed up.
[56:09.520 --> 56:10.520]  I know I'm backed up.
[56:10.520 --> 56:14.520]  So there's, you know, worst case scenario that all I've got to do is just wait and restore
[56:14.520 --> 56:15.520]  from backup.
[56:15.520 --> 56:16.520]  I haven't lost anything.
[56:16.520 --> 56:18.520]  I'm backed up in a couple of ways.
[56:18.520 --> 56:19.520]  But one of the ways I'm backed up.
[56:19.520 --> 56:22.520]  And I know I'm backed up is through back place.
[56:22.520 --> 56:25.520]  Which is online backup that runs in the background.
[56:25.520 --> 56:28.520]  And it's actually the one that gives me the most piece of mind.
[56:28.520 --> 56:30.520]  Because it's the one that I don't have to do anything about.
[56:30.520 --> 56:32.520]  And I literally, this is what I did.
[56:32.520 --> 56:33.520]  I just got to resuscitate the Mac.
[56:33.520 --> 56:34.520]  It was late at night.
[56:34.520 --> 56:35.520]  And I thought, I'll worry about this in the morning.
[56:35.520 --> 56:36.520]  I just went to a different machine.
[56:36.520 --> 56:38.520]  Could have been my iPhone.
[56:38.520 --> 56:39.520]  Could have been another Mac.
[56:39.520 --> 56:40.520]  Doesn't matter.
[56:40.520 --> 56:41.520]  You just log in the back place.
[56:41.520 --> 56:43.520]  I logged into my back place account and just looked.
[56:43.520 --> 56:47.520]  And it said that I was backed up as of like 8 p.m. last night.
[56:47.520 --> 56:49.520]  And I was like, oh, I'm all set.
[56:49.520 --> 56:51.520]  What is back place backup?
[56:51.520 --> 56:53.520]  It backs up everything on your Mac.
[56:53.520 --> 56:54.520]  Everything.
[56:54.520 --> 56:57.520]  If you have external hard drives, it backs those up too.
[56:57.520 --> 56:59.520]  What's the limit on space?
[56:59.520 --> 57:00.520]  It's unlimited.
[57:00.520 --> 57:02.520]  You just pay $5 a month.
[57:02.520 --> 57:05.520]  And everything on your Mac gets backed up.
[57:05.520 --> 57:06.520]  What's the catch?
[57:06.520 --> 57:07.520]  There is no catch.
[57:07.520 --> 57:12.520]  If there's technically a catch, it's that the $5 a month, which is incredibly low,
[57:12.520 --> 57:13.520]  is per Mac.
[57:13.520 --> 57:19.520]  But that per Mac cost is everything on the Mac, including the external drives.
[57:19.520 --> 57:21.520]  If I didn't have back place, I have no idea.
[57:21.520 --> 57:24.520]  Either we've been up all night trying to restore or resuscitate the drive,
[57:24.520 --> 57:29.520]  opening the case, trying to take the SSD out and put it in another case,
[57:29.520 --> 57:32.520]  and putting it in state up all night, doing stuff like that.
[57:32.520 --> 57:35.520]  All I did was just log in my back place account.
[57:35.520 --> 57:36.520]  I knew I was backed up.
[57:36.520 --> 57:38.520]  Nothing to worry about.
[57:38.520 --> 57:40.520]  Can't say enough.
[57:40.520 --> 57:43.520]  What a great feeling that is.
[57:43.520 --> 57:45.520]  Here's what you do to sign up.
[57:45.520 --> 57:48.520]  Go to backblaze.com slash daring fireball.
[57:48.520 --> 57:53.520]  Backblaze.blaze.ie.com slash daring fireball.
[57:53.520 --> 57:55.520]  They know you come from the show that way.
[57:55.520 --> 57:57.520]  You get a 14 day free trial.
[57:57.520 --> 57:59.520]  No credit card upfront.
[57:59.520 --> 58:00.520]  Just do that.
[58:00.520 --> 58:03.520]  Install their software on your Mac.
[58:03.520 --> 58:05.520]  Set up an account.
[58:05.520 --> 58:06.520]  Use the 14 days.
[58:06.520 --> 58:10.520]  It might take a while for all of your stuff to get upstream through the cloud.
[58:10.520 --> 58:12.520]  Do that in the first 14 days.
[58:12.520 --> 58:14.520]  See how it works.
[58:14.520 --> 58:17.520]  See how it's just once you have it set up, it just runs.
[58:17.520 --> 58:18.520]  You don't do anything.
[58:18.520 --> 58:21.520]  You don't have to remember once a day to hit the backblaze button and do an upload.
[58:21.520 --> 58:24.520]  It just uploads as it sees that you need to incrementally.
[58:24.520 --> 58:27.520]  Can't say enough.
[58:27.520 --> 58:28.520]  Here I am.
[58:28.520 --> 58:29.520]  Testimony to it.
[58:29.520 --> 58:30.520]  Broken Mac.
[58:30.520 --> 58:31.520]  Nothing lost.
[58:31.520 --> 58:32.520]  Camp couldn't be easier.
[58:32.520 --> 58:35.520]  So my thanks to backblaze.
[58:35.520 --> 58:36.520]  Go get them.
[58:36.520 --> 58:38.520]  Don't be a dummy who's not backed up.
[58:38.520 --> 58:39.520]  That's great.
[58:39.520 --> 58:43.520]  I mean, just honestly, we had to delay the show because you're Mac is all bust up.
[58:43.520 --> 58:44.520]  Yeah.
[58:44.520 --> 58:46.520]  I'm glad to work there.
[58:46.520 --> 58:47.520]  Yeah.
[58:47.520 --> 58:48.520]  The best thing about it.
[58:48.520 --> 58:51.520]  The best thing about it is you don't have to remember anything to do it.
[58:51.520 --> 58:52.520]  Yeah, I know.
[58:52.520 --> 58:55.520]  I don't trust myself either.
[58:55.520 --> 58:57.520]  Which is a testament to backblaze.
[58:57.520 --> 58:58.520]  I don't really like it.
[58:58.520 --> 59:00.520]  I'm never going to.
[59:00.520 --> 59:04.520]  If I intentionally have to think about backing up, but I'm going to screwed up some time.
[59:04.520 --> 59:05.520]  Yeah.
[59:05.520 --> 59:06.520]  It's not really backup.
[59:06.520 --> 59:08.520]  Somebody argued with me once and I agree with it.
[59:08.520 --> 59:13.520]  If your backup system is something you have to invoke manually, that's not a backup system.
[59:13.520 --> 59:14.520]  That's smart.
[59:14.520 --> 59:15.520]  That's smart.
[59:15.520 --> 59:19.520]  You know, it's something you've got clones of your data.
[59:19.520 --> 59:20.520]  It's worth doing.
[59:20.520 --> 59:23.520]  Super duper like that, the third part, you know, external drives.
[59:23.520 --> 59:24.520]  Right.
[59:24.520 --> 59:26.520]  But it's, it's not really backed up.
[59:26.520 --> 59:28.520]  Backed up is when something hits unexpectedly.
[59:28.520 --> 59:31.520]  And then I go and check and I'm backed up from the last moment.
[59:31.520 --> 59:33.520]  I remember sitting at my computer.
[59:33.520 --> 59:34.520]  Right.
[59:34.520 --> 59:35.520]  That's a backup.
[59:35.520 --> 59:38.520]  Well, I think, you know, I think that's what time machine tries to address.
[59:38.520 --> 59:42.520]  And I think that that's what backblaze doesn't spades, right?
[59:42.520 --> 59:43.520]  Yeah.
[59:43.520 --> 59:44.520]  Yeah.
[59:44.520 --> 59:45.520]  Time machine's a great solution too.
[59:45.520 --> 59:46.520]  I'd say do them all.
[59:46.520 --> 59:48.520]  Do, you know, there's just no way you could be more backed up.
[59:48.520 --> 59:49.520]  Yeah.
[59:49.520 --> 59:53.520]  Well, you can't be, but not in terms of your computer.
[59:53.520 --> 59:54.520]  Yeah.
[59:54.520 --> 59:56.520]  No, time machine's one of the best things that Apple did.
[59:56.520 --> 1:00:00.520]  I still think that they need to, I would love to see Apple do something and prove the
[1:00:00.520 --> 1:00:05.520]  means of using time machine from a MacBook.
[1:00:05.520 --> 1:00:10.520]  Like, I know they've got the time machine base station, but I still feel like
[1:00:10.520 --> 1:00:12.520]  that could be, that could be a better experience.
[1:00:12.520 --> 1:00:17.520]  I mean, did you notice that they got really, maybe I can talk about this?
[1:00:17.520 --> 1:00:21.520]  I'm going to anyway, they got rid of the star backfield background.
[1:00:21.520 --> 1:00:22.520]  Yeah.
[1:00:22.520 --> 1:00:23.520]  Yeah.
[1:00:23.520 --> 1:00:24.520]  Yeah.
[1:00:24.520 --> 1:00:25.520]  Good call.
[1:00:25.520 --> 1:00:26.520]  Wait.
[1:00:26.520 --> 1:00:27.520]  Yeah.
[1:00:27.520 --> 1:00:28.520]  Yeah.
[1:00:28.520 --> 1:00:30.520]  My understanding is the star.
[1:00:30.520 --> 1:00:33.520]  The star field was literally a joke.
[1:00:33.520 --> 1:00:38.520]  It was like, it was, it was, my understanding is that it was
[1:00:38.520 --> 1:00:39.520]  Mattos basically making a joke.
[1:00:39.520 --> 1:00:40.520]  Yeah.
[1:00:40.520 --> 1:00:41.520]  Yes.
[1:00:41.520 --> 1:00:42.520]  Run with that.
[1:00:42.520 --> 1:00:43.520]  Yeah.
[1:00:43.520 --> 1:00:44.520]  It was definitely Mattos.
[1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:45.520]  Yeah.
[1:00:45.520 --> 1:00:47.520]  Yeah.
[1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:48.520]  But that's hilarious.
[1:00:48.520 --> 1:00:51.520]  It was like, here's the goofiest thing I can imagine.
[1:00:51.520 --> 1:00:52.520]  Yeah.
[1:00:52.520 --> 1:00:53.520]  Let's make that a product.
[1:00:53.520 --> 1:00:54.520]  Right.
[1:00:54.520 --> 1:00:58.520]  It's like an interesting way of starting like, well, what's the most outlandish
[1:00:58.520 --> 1:00:59.520]  what?
[1:00:59.520 --> 1:01:01.520]  What's the most, what's the most buttoned up?
[1:01:01.520 --> 1:01:02.520]  Yeah.
[1:01:02.520 --> 1:01:03.520]  We could do it well.
[1:01:03.520 --> 1:01:04.520]  You say time machine.
[1:01:04.520 --> 1:01:05.520]  Here's Doctor Who.
[1:01:05.520 --> 1:01:06.520]  Right.
[1:01:06.520 --> 1:01:07.520]  Well, you could do like both extremes.
[1:01:07.520 --> 1:01:10.520]  You could say, what's the most straight-laced conservative buttoned-up way we
[1:01:10.520 --> 1:01:13.520]  could do it and say, well, it would look like the finder, except just maybe it's
[1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:16.520]  a different color.
[1:01:16.520 --> 1:01:17.520]  Okay.
[1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:18.520]  All right.
[1:01:18.520 --> 1:01:20.520]  What's the most outlandish way we could do it?
[1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:21.520]  Yeah.
[1:01:21.520 --> 1:01:22.520]  Yeah.
[1:01:22.520 --> 1:01:23.520]  Yeah.
[1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:24.520]  Yeah.
[1:01:24.520 --> 1:01:26.520]  You're like, it's like the credit scene of Doctor Who, like the opening.
[1:01:26.520 --> 1:01:27.520]  Right.
[1:01:27.520 --> 1:01:28.520]  You're Doctor Who.
[1:01:28.520 --> 1:01:29.520]  Yeah.
[1:01:29.520 --> 1:01:30.520]  And we'll do it.
[1:01:30.520 --> 1:01:31.520]  We'll do it in 3D.
[1:01:31.520 --> 1:01:32.520]  Yeah.
[1:01:32.520 --> 1:01:37.520]  And then, you know, they were like, let's, let's go ahead and do it.
[1:01:37.520 --> 1:01:39.520]  We were talking about forestall before.
[1:01:39.520 --> 1:01:40.520]  And somebody emailed me.
[1:01:40.520 --> 1:01:42.520]  And again, you can't, you know, it's small data.
[1:01:42.520 --> 1:01:47.520]  It's small data samples because it's only been two major releases since forestall left.
[1:01:47.520 --> 1:01:50.520]  But somebody emailed me.
[1:01:50.520 --> 1:01:52.520]  I didn't recognize the name.
[1:01:52.520 --> 1:01:57.520]  It's not like somebody who, you know, but it was clearly somebody who had some, you know,
[1:01:57.520 --> 1:02:01.520]  who used to work at Apple, you know, some engineer and just said, hey, you know, but doesn't
[1:02:01.520 --> 1:02:02.520]  work there anymore.
[1:02:02.520 --> 1:02:07.840]  And just more or less said, you know, this could be, you know, the downside of losing Scott
[1:02:07.840 --> 1:02:12.840]  forestall because whatever you want to say about Scott forestall, Scott forestall knew how to manage
[1:02:12.840 --> 1:02:15.840]  large shot software projects.
[1:02:15.840 --> 1:02:17.840]  I don't know how much from the outside.
[1:02:17.840 --> 1:02:19.840]  Now, this is somebody who was on the inside who said that.
[1:02:19.840 --> 1:02:24.840]  It said, you know, this is, this just seems a lot like Scott was better at knowing that
[1:02:24.840 --> 1:02:29.840]  we should, we should kill a couple of these features because we're not, we're not going to ship
[1:02:29.840 --> 1:02:31.840]  on time otherwise.
[1:02:31.840 --> 1:02:34.840]  Um, I, you know, I don't know.
[1:02:34.840 --> 1:02:37.840]  I thought that was an interesting observation.
[1:02:37.840 --> 1:02:38.840]  Maybe that's not true.
[1:02:38.840 --> 1:02:41.840]  Maybe there's, you know, people from Apple who are listening to the show right now shaking
[1:02:41.840 --> 1:02:43.840]  their heads thinking, my God, that Scott was the worst at that.
[1:02:43.840 --> 1:02:44.840]  I don't know.
[1:02:44.840 --> 1:02:46.840]  I'm just saying that's what one person wrote in.
[1:02:46.840 --> 1:02:51.840]  Um, but so far, two for two major iOS releases post forestall.
[1:02:51.840 --> 1:02:56.840]  And again, just leaving aside the design style of them, which clearly was in opposition
[1:02:56.840 --> 1:02:58.840]  to his, you know, his direction.
[1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:03.840]  Um, but in terms of how good were they, you know, when they shipped in September,
[1:03:03.840 --> 1:03:07.840]  they did not, not so good quality wise.
[1:03:07.840 --> 1:03:13.840]  And I think in both cases, it was because of, I think it's too much to do in a year.
[1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:16.840]  I honestly think it's too much to do in a year.
[1:03:16.840 --> 1:03:22.840]  Uh, to be honest, I've heard nothing bad about working under Scott forestall.
[1:03:22.840 --> 1:03:30.840]  Uh, you know, beyond the regular Apple rigmarole.
[1:03:30.840 --> 1:03:34.840]  Right. That, you know, it was demanding of course, I mean, things are obvious.
[1:03:34.840 --> 1:03:40.840]  Like, yeah, yeah, you're, if you're reporting to Scott forestall, you're, you know,
[1:03:40.840 --> 1:03:43.840]  you're up there and you did such a high pressure job for sure.
[1:03:43.840 --> 1:03:44.840]  Right.
[1:03:44.840 --> 1:03:52.840]  Um, but in general, I have, it's unclear to me why the break with the company
[1:03:52.840 --> 1:03:53.840]  happened.
[1:03:53.840 --> 1:03:59.840]  Uh, you know, maybe it was just time to, I don't know, change management, like,
[1:03:59.840 --> 1:04:00.840]  change it up a little bit.
[1:04:00.840 --> 1:04:05.840]  It's unfortunate that since then, we've had a couple of OS releases.
[1:04:05.840 --> 1:04:13.840]  iOS releases that maybe seem a little bit, uh, undercooked.
[1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:16.840]  That's a lack of a better word.
[1:04:16.840 --> 1:04:17.840]  Yeah.
[1:04:17.840 --> 1:04:21.840]  And I, I know you wanted it to being locked to the hardware,
[1:04:21.840 --> 1:04:27.840]  but I, I more attributed it to being, um, overzealous with adding features.
[1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:29.840]  Right.
[1:04:29.840 --> 1:04:30.840]  Because, I mean, there's two things, right?
[1:04:30.840 --> 1:04:33.840]  Like, you can, you can either hit the date or you can do less stuff.
[1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:35.840]  And I, I would err on this site.
[1:04:35.840 --> 1:04:40.840]  I'm certainly in this case, just do less stuff rather than.
[1:04:40.840 --> 1:04:41.840]  Yeah.
[1:04:41.840 --> 1:04:43.840]  And I can't, you can't change the hardware release.
[1:04:43.840 --> 1:04:44.840]  So.
[1:04:44.840 --> 1:04:48.840]  And I think you have to combine that with the new, and then, you know, again,
[1:04:48.840 --> 1:04:51.840]  from product marketing perspective, I totally understand it.
[1:04:51.840 --> 1:04:54.840]  But from this style of, we're going to tell you all about it at
[1:04:54.840 --> 1:04:57.840]  WWDC in June.
[1:04:57.840 --> 1:05:00.840]  And I feel like they're, they feel like they're painted in a corner that
[1:05:00.840 --> 1:05:04.840]  what they've promised in June has to ship in September.
[1:05:04.840 --> 1:05:05.840]  For the most.
[1:05:05.840 --> 1:05:06.840]  Yes.
[1:05:06.840 --> 1:05:07.840]  Yeah.
[1:05:07.840 --> 1:05:09.840]  And there's a couple of things that don't, but that will be coming in October
[1:05:09.840 --> 1:05:12.840]  because they, they need Yosemite for them.
[1:05:12.840 --> 1:05:14.840]  And it's the same, I've pointed this out before.
[1:05:14.840 --> 1:05:18.840]  It's like, it's like the, um, iCloud keychain was last year.
[1:05:18.840 --> 1:05:21.840]  iCloud keychain was a WWDC unveiled feature.
[1:05:21.840 --> 1:05:25.840]  So in September, iOS 7 came out and even though it was in the beta's
[1:05:25.840 --> 1:05:28.840]  throughout the summer, it wasn't in the final version.
[1:05:28.840 --> 1:05:33.840]  And then it was there in October in a point release when Mac OS 10
[1:05:33.840 --> 1:05:36.840]  Mavericks shipped because it somehow needed all of that, you know,
[1:05:36.840 --> 1:05:39.840]  and again, it goes back to the gears needing all the, you need all the
[1:05:39.840 --> 1:05:41.840]  gears to be there for this thing to work.
[1:05:41.840 --> 1:05:42.840]  Right.
[1:05:42.840 --> 1:05:46.840]  And as I said at the top of the show, I think the interconnect in this is,
[1:05:46.840 --> 1:05:51.840]  and with the watch too, and, you know, the imaginary Apple TV,
[1:05:51.840 --> 1:05:53.840]  sometime next year.
[1:05:53.840 --> 1:05:54.840]  Yeah.
[1:05:54.840 --> 1:05:55.840]  This is just,
[1:05:55.840 --> 1:05:58.840]  So here, it's, it's, it's going to keep getting more complicated, right?
[1:05:58.840 --> 1:05:59.840]  Like the,
[1:05:59.840 --> 1:06:00.840]  Right.
[1:06:00.840 --> 1:06:05.840]  The interoperability is going to end up being a difficult thing to address
[1:06:05.840 --> 1:06:07.840]  in a lockstep manner.
[1:06:07.840 --> 1:06:09.840]  And you need a lockstep.
[1:06:09.840 --> 1:06:13.840]  Well, you don't need one, but ideally you would have a lockstep at least
[1:06:13.840 --> 1:06:15.840]  for all of these features.
[1:06:15.840 --> 1:06:16.840]  Maybe.
[1:06:16.840 --> 1:06:19.840]  And this is me trying to play a devil's advocate.
[1:06:19.840 --> 1:06:21.840]  Maybe take a more optimistic view.
[1:06:21.840 --> 1:06:27.840]  Maybe though iOS 8 was sort of like iOS 7 where iOS 7 was this.
[1:06:27.840 --> 1:06:29.840]  We have to do all these visuals at once.
[1:06:29.840 --> 1:06:33.840]  We have to redo the visuals and all these animations and everything that you,
[1:06:33.840 --> 1:06:37.840]  all the pixels that are thrown on screen across the system at once in nine
[1:06:37.840 --> 1:06:38.840]  months.
[1:06:38.840 --> 1:06:40.840]  And so of course it was going to be rocky.
[1:06:40.840 --> 1:06:44.840]  And maybe iOS 8 is the same way in terms of laying the
[1:06:44.840 --> 1:06:48.840]  foundation for all of this inter-app communication.
[1:06:48.840 --> 1:06:50.840]  Yeah, the extensions in all of that, right?
[1:06:50.840 --> 1:06:51.840]  Yeah.
[1:06:51.840 --> 1:06:53.840]  Well, inter, and I'll go even further.
[1:06:53.840 --> 1:06:56.840]  Inter-app and inter-device communication.
[1:06:56.840 --> 1:06:57.840]  Good for it.
[1:06:57.840 --> 1:06:58.840]  Yeah.
[1:06:58.840 --> 1:07:02.840]  And that may be, you know, things can slow down in terms of how much
[1:07:02.840 --> 1:07:06.840]  happens year over year in that iOS 9 in September.
[1:07:06.840 --> 1:07:09.840]  Will it buy a nature bite off less?
[1:07:09.840 --> 1:07:12.840]  Because it's going to be about making these things work better and more
[1:07:12.840 --> 1:07:16.840]  seamlessly rather than starting them from scratch.
[1:07:16.840 --> 1:07:17.840]  Yeah.
[1:07:17.840 --> 1:07:18.840]  I agree.
[1:07:18.840 --> 1:07:21.840]  Which, you know, and again, I don't want to pretend that
[1:07:21.840 --> 1:07:26.840]  iOS 8 or the extension, I don't think, are bad,
[1:07:26.840 --> 1:07:31.840]  misconceived, or poorly done.
[1:07:31.840 --> 1:07:36.840]  There's just more rough edges in the OS than you would expect.
[1:07:36.840 --> 1:07:41.840]  And I think that's because of the, you know,
[1:07:41.840 --> 1:07:46.840]  the, I think they tried to do a lot more in a lot less time than
[1:07:46.840 --> 1:07:51.840]  they could really achieve with certainty.
[1:07:51.840 --> 1:07:52.840]  Yeah.
[1:07:52.840 --> 1:07:57.840]  And I don't think it's in any way, a, a,
[1:07:57.840 --> 1:08:02.840]  right, refuting the idea that Apple is internally more collaborative
[1:08:02.840 --> 1:08:07.840]  than before, or that they could solve this, that they're still
[1:08:07.840 --> 1:08:10.840]  understaffed or something like that.
[1:08:10.840 --> 1:08:13.840]  I think it's, it's simply the nature of, you know, it's,
[1:08:13.840 --> 1:08:15.840]  it's the mythical man month.
[1:08:15.840 --> 1:08:16.840]  You can't exactly.
[1:08:16.840 --> 1:08:20.840]  You cannot, you really, you can actually like almost prove it
[1:08:20.840 --> 1:08:24.840]  that you cannot ship software high quality software faster by
[1:08:24.840 --> 1:08:25.840]  throwing people at it.
[1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:28.840]  You know, and that I do think I think the nature of the features
[1:08:28.840 --> 1:08:32.840]  themselves shows that their, the company is more collaborative,
[1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:36.840]  but that doesn't mean that you can, that it makes it possible to do this.
[1:08:36.840 --> 1:08:39.840]  Like if they weren't, if they were as siloed as they used to be,
[1:08:39.840 --> 1:08:41.840]  there's, these features wouldn't even exist.
[1:08:41.840 --> 1:08:45.840]  So do you know who argues against this notion?
[1:08:45.840 --> 1:08:48.840]  Smart guy.
[1:08:48.840 --> 1:08:53.840]  His name is John Gruber from back in 2003.
[1:08:53.840 --> 1:08:58.840]  This is that, yeah, this came up last night on Twitter.
[1:08:58.840 --> 1:09:00.840]  And you know what, this is a great article.
[1:09:00.840 --> 1:09:04.840]  I disagree with a lot of it as I did at the time,
[1:09:04.840 --> 1:09:07.840]  because I don't think we, I don't even know if we knew each other,
[1:09:07.840 --> 1:09:10.840]  but you know, I'd read you because you're smart,
[1:09:10.840 --> 1:09:13.840]  and just disagree with a lot of your arguments.
[1:09:13.840 --> 1:09:17.840]  But this is literally called the good, the bad, and the RV,
[1:09:17.840 --> 1:09:21.840]  which is classic dick move.
[1:09:21.840 --> 1:09:23.840]  This was when RV left.
[1:09:23.840 --> 1:09:28.840]  It was, it was when RV left, and like, yeah.
[1:09:28.840 --> 1:09:29.840]  Yeah.
[1:09:29.840 --> 1:09:32.840]  So lay, so lay was like the replacement for the software guy.
[1:09:32.840 --> 1:09:36.840]  But you have, you have a couple of, this is when you actually
[1:09:36.840 --> 1:09:39.840]  write like a million words.
[1:09:39.840 --> 1:09:43.840]  You, you haven't learned to edit yourself yet.
[1:09:43.840 --> 1:09:46.840]  But an essential aspect of Mac OS X success is that it didn't
[1:09:46.840 --> 1:09:50.840]  merely ship, it shipped with discernible momentum.
[1:09:50.840 --> 1:09:53.840]  It got better, both in terms of performance and usability,
[1:09:53.840 --> 1:09:55.840]  steadily and on a regular schedule.
[1:09:55.840 --> 1:10:01.840]  First the public beta, beta, and then each release from 10 through 2.
[1:10:01.840 --> 1:10:05.840]  You go on to say, I feel like a jackass quoting you to yourself,
[1:10:05.840 --> 1:10:08.840]  but it's my 11 year old self.
[1:10:08.840 --> 1:10:11.840]  So it's like a whole different person.
[1:10:11.840 --> 1:10:15.840]  This one major update per year schedule is an essential aspect
[1:10:15.840 --> 1:10:17.840]  of Mac OS X success.
[1:10:17.840 --> 1:10:20.840]  The general perception is Mac OS X isn't just good,
[1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:23.840]  but that is getting, and it's good and getting better.
[1:10:23.840 --> 1:10:26.840]  A perception seems to be held not just by the Mac community,
[1:10:26.840 --> 1:10:28.840]  but the computer industry in general.
[1:10:28.840 --> 1:10:31.840]  I think that's an incredibly astute point.
[1:10:31.840 --> 1:10:36.840]  The best of the article I can argue with you about.
[1:10:36.840 --> 1:10:39.840]  But you specifically call out the yearly schedule.
[1:10:39.840 --> 1:10:41.840]  Yeah, well, but I'll say this.
[1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:43.840]  I don't think you're in disagreement with me, though.
[1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:47.840]  And that was, it was the first few years of Mac OS X.
[1:10:47.840 --> 1:10:50.840]  It was definitely, I mean, it was very annual.
[1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:52.840]  I mean, the first release was six months.
[1:10:52.840 --> 1:10:53.840]  The 10-1 came out.
[1:10:53.840 --> 1:10:54.840]  Yeah, and they really needed it.
[1:10:54.840 --> 1:10:56.840]  And they talked to people who worked on it.
[1:10:56.840 --> 1:10:58.840]  They were like, yeah, that had to happen.
[1:10:58.840 --> 1:11:03.840]  Also, trivia, first free, always 10 release.
[1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:05.840]  Was it 10-1, 10-1 was free?
[1:11:05.840 --> 1:11:06.840]  10-1 was free.
[1:11:06.840 --> 1:11:07.840]  They just gave it away.
[1:11:07.840 --> 1:11:09.840]  Because it was like any happy dealer.
[1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:10.840]  Yeah, it was an apology.
[1:11:10.840 --> 1:11:13.840]  They would burn you with DVD and just give it to you.
[1:11:13.840 --> 1:11:15.840]  And that was when, after that though,
[1:11:15.840 --> 1:11:17.840]  they were still selling them for $129 each.
[1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:18.840]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:11:18.840 --> 1:11:19.840]  Yeah.
[1:11:19.840 --> 1:11:23.840]  I remember being shocked when they started dropping the price
[1:11:23.840 --> 1:11:24.840]  of the, oh, major OS release.
[1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:25.840]  Yeah, me too.
[1:11:25.840 --> 1:11:27.840]  $129 bucks compared to Windows.
[1:11:27.840 --> 1:11:28.840]  Seems reasonable to me.
[1:11:28.840 --> 1:11:29.840]  Right.
[1:11:29.840 --> 1:11:32.840]  But now it seems like, oh my god, that would be awful.
[1:11:32.840 --> 1:11:33.840]  Yeah.
[1:11:33.840 --> 1:11:34.840]  No one would upgrade.
[1:11:34.840 --> 1:11:35.840]  Now.
[1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:36.840]  The worst.
[1:11:36.840 --> 1:11:37.840]  The worst.
[1:11:37.840 --> 1:11:42.840]  But I see the thing is though, is that I feel like in those 10-1,
[1:11:42.840 --> 1:11:45.840]  10-2, 10-3, 10-4.
[1:11:45.840 --> 1:11:49.840]  I forget when I slowed down and dropped off the annual cycle,
[1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:50.840]  maybe around 10-5.
[1:11:50.840 --> 1:11:51.840]  Yeah.
[1:11:51.840 --> 1:11:54.840]  But it wasn't two steps forward, one step back.
[1:11:54.840 --> 1:11:58.840]  It was just two steps forward, year after year after year.
[1:11:58.840 --> 1:12:00.840]  And there wasn't any kind of butt.
[1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:03.840]  I mean, there might have been niggling details here and there.
[1:12:03.840 --> 1:12:05.840]  If we went back and read Syracuse's, you know,
[1:12:05.840 --> 1:12:07.840]  refresh our lines about what it was.
[1:12:07.840 --> 1:12:08.840]  But they were niggles.
[1:12:08.840 --> 1:12:11.840]  There wasn't like major fundamental things that were,
[1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:13.840]  here's a big new thing in 10-2.
[1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:16.840]  It didn't ship like totally not working.
[1:12:16.840 --> 1:12:17.840]  It shipped and it worked.
[1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:19.840]  And it was like, oh, this is not more or less.
[1:12:19.840 --> 1:12:22.840]  I mean, you could point about spotlight or some weird little
[1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:26.840]  patterns, you know, but something that was broken in the,
[1:12:26.840 --> 1:12:30.840]  you know, the first, you know, the GM version and, you know,
[1:12:30.840 --> 1:12:31.840]  needed a bug fix.
[1:12:31.840 --> 1:12:32.840]  So, you know, they're always bugs.
[1:12:32.840 --> 1:12:37.840]  And Syracuse, yeah, the finder is garbage and fine.
[1:12:37.840 --> 1:12:42.840]  But nobody was arguing though that nobody was arguing in the 10-1,
[1:12:42.840 --> 1:12:46.840]  to 10-2, to 10-3, to 10-4 era that Apple's trying to do too much
[1:12:46.840 --> 1:12:47.840]  year over year.
[1:12:47.840 --> 1:12:48.840]  Right.
[1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:50.840]  I think it was more like what I said in the article that,
[1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:52.840]  wow, they're really on fire.
[1:12:52.840 --> 1:12:55.840]  And they're just improving the OS on a steady basis.
[1:12:55.840 --> 1:12:57.840]  Well, you did at the, at the start of the article,
[1:12:57.840 --> 1:12:59.840]  and I'm trying to find it now, because I don't want to miss
[1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:02.840]  quote you, but you said something about copious software
[1:13:02.840 --> 1:13:04.840]  projects.
[1:13:04.840 --> 1:13:08.840]  The announcement also in case that the change was more
[1:13:08.840 --> 1:13:11.840]  than titular, and that Sir Lay will be taking over
[1:13:11.840 --> 1:13:14.840]  responsibility for day to day management of the company's
[1:13:14.840 --> 1:13:19.840]  copious software projects, which at the time did not
[1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:20.840]  raise an eyebrow at all.
[1:13:20.840 --> 1:13:21.840]  Right.
[1:13:21.840 --> 1:13:22.840]  Yes, completely correct.
[1:13:22.840 --> 1:13:24.840]  Now, that's kind of funny.
[1:13:24.840 --> 1:13:29.840]  Just thinking about how the scope and the scale has changed.
[1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:30.840]  This is great piece.
[1:13:30.840 --> 1:13:33.840]  I implore everybody to go read this piece.
[1:13:33.840 --> 1:13:34.840]  I...
[1:13:34.840 --> 1:13:36.840]  It was a different time for sure.
[1:13:36.840 --> 1:13:37.840]  Yeah.
[1:13:37.840 --> 1:13:41.840]  And it was, that piece was also, I specifically remember when I wrote
[1:13:41.840 --> 1:13:46.840]  it, it was trying to catch up from the fact that
[1:13:46.840 --> 1:13:49.840]  Daring Fireball didn't start until 2002.
[1:13:49.840 --> 1:13:56.840]  And a lot of the, the next, the new guys from next
[1:13:56.840 --> 1:14:01.840]  versus old guys from the Mac side friction was mostly played
[1:14:01.840 --> 1:14:06.840]  out in around 99, 2000, 2001, before I had Daring Fireball
[1:14:06.840 --> 1:14:07.840]  to do it.
[1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:08.840]  And it was kind of me.
[1:14:08.840 --> 1:14:11.840]  So you dredged it up from a little.
[1:14:11.840 --> 1:14:13.840]  I think a little bit, you know.
[1:14:13.840 --> 1:14:15.840]  I remember reading this piece and being like,
[1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:17.840]  really, are we still doing this?
[1:14:17.840 --> 1:14:18.840]  Thank you.
[1:14:18.840 --> 1:14:19.840]  Right.
[1:14:19.840 --> 1:14:20.840]  But it's smart.
[1:14:20.840 --> 1:14:21.840]  And I don't have to agree with...
[1:14:21.840 --> 1:14:24.840]  I understand a lot of the perspective now.
[1:14:24.840 --> 1:14:27.840]  I still like to...
[1:14:27.840 --> 1:14:30.840]  And in hindsight, you know, in hindsight, it's, you know,
[1:14:30.840 --> 1:14:32.840]  it all worked out for the better, you know.
[1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:36.840]  But I've said this before that I still like to think that the
[1:14:36.840 --> 1:14:41.840]  Apple Next combination, I know some people have called it a
[1:14:41.840 --> 1:14:42.840]  reverse takeover.
[1:14:42.840 --> 1:14:43.840]  Yeah.
[1:14:43.840 --> 1:14:45.840]  But at an executive level, it did happen.
[1:14:45.840 --> 1:14:46.840]  Yeah.
[1:14:46.840 --> 1:14:49.840]  It's in terms of Steve and people he picked directly to
[1:14:49.840 --> 1:14:50.840]  report to him.
[1:14:50.840 --> 1:14:52.840]  It was mostly a reverse.
[1:14:52.840 --> 1:14:53.840]  Well, whatever.
[1:14:53.840 --> 1:14:54.840]  It's a marriage.
[1:14:54.840 --> 1:14:55.840]  It's a marriage.
[1:14:55.840 --> 1:14:57.840]  And the next people ended up wearing the pants.
[1:14:57.840 --> 1:14:58.840]  Shiller was already there.
[1:14:58.840 --> 1:14:59.840]  Right.
[1:14:59.840 --> 1:15:00.840]  And Shiller stayed.
[1:15:00.840 --> 1:15:01.840]  And his there to the state.
[1:15:01.840 --> 1:15:02.840]  Johnny Ive was there.
[1:15:02.840 --> 1:15:04.840]  And Steve, you know, as I said,
[1:15:04.840 --> 1:15:06.840]  we kind of picked him out of the,
[1:15:06.840 --> 1:15:07.840]  out of the car.
[1:15:07.840 --> 1:15:08.840]  He went in.
[1:15:08.840 --> 1:15:11.840]  Steve went into the industrial design group having looked at Apple
[1:15:11.840 --> 1:15:15.840]  shipping products and drawn an estimation of the quality of their
[1:15:15.840 --> 1:15:16.840]  industrial design.
[1:15:16.840 --> 1:15:18.840]  He thought, I'm going to have to go in here and fire all of these people.
[1:15:18.840 --> 1:15:22.840]  Walked in and met Johnny Ive and saw the stuff that Johnny Ive had
[1:15:22.840 --> 1:15:23.840]  wanted to ship.
[1:15:23.840 --> 1:15:25.840]  And was like, holy shit, this is a gold mine.
[1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:26.840]  These guys are geniuses.
[1:15:26.840 --> 1:15:27.840]  Yeah.
[1:15:27.840 --> 1:15:31.840]  You know, it was like, you know, to be fair to computers at the
[1:15:31.840 --> 1:15:33.840]  time, Apple was still shipping some beautiful stuff.
[1:15:33.840 --> 1:15:36.840]  Go look at a beige G3 266.
[1:15:36.840 --> 1:15:37.840]  Yeah.
[1:15:37.840 --> 1:15:42.840]  Just before it had that little sidebar thing and the way that the panel came
[1:15:42.840 --> 1:15:47.840]  off with like that little, it was like a, like a green bonding
[1:15:47.840 --> 1:15:51.840]  blue almost kind of latch that you could just hit in the side panel with
[1:15:51.840 --> 1:15:54.840]  fall off so you could access the interior.
[1:15:54.840 --> 1:15:58.840]  I had way better case design than anybody making PCs.
[1:15:58.840 --> 1:16:03.840]  I had a Power Mac 9600.
[1:16:03.840 --> 1:16:08.840]  Um, God, I forget what the chip was in that.
[1:16:08.840 --> 1:16:11.840]  Like a 604.
[1:16:11.840 --> 1:16:13.840]  That makes a power piece.
[1:16:13.840 --> 1:16:14.840]  Yeah, I think so.
[1:16:14.840 --> 1:16:15.840]  That makes sense.
[1:16:15.840 --> 1:16:16.840]  Yeah.
[1:16:16.840 --> 1:16:19.840]  I think it was before there were rumors of an upcoming 620 that I
[1:16:19.840 --> 1:16:22.840]  don't think they ever shipped and they went to the G3 instead.
[1:16:22.840 --> 1:16:23.840]  I had a 604.
[1:16:23.840 --> 1:16:24.840]  Yeah.
[1:16:24.840 --> 1:16:26.840]  But it was, but it had that same thing though where you could access
[1:16:26.840 --> 1:16:29.840]  the case internals without like tools and stuff like that.
[1:16:29.840 --> 1:16:30.840]  You could take it apart.
[1:16:30.840 --> 1:16:31.840]  Yeah.
[1:16:31.840 --> 1:16:32.840]  Not needing a screwdriver.
[1:16:32.840 --> 1:16:33.840]  Yeah.
[1:16:33.840 --> 1:16:35.840]  I mean, that was my going at the time.
[1:16:35.840 --> 1:16:36.840]  Yeah.
[1:16:36.840 --> 1:16:38.840]  And everything was super neatly organized inside.
[1:16:38.840 --> 1:16:40.840]  It was like going into like a library.
[1:16:40.840 --> 1:16:42.840]  And it's like, here's where you'd put Ram in.
[1:16:42.840 --> 1:16:43.840]  Here's where you do.
[1:16:43.840 --> 1:16:46.840]  So if you wanted to add Ram or change the Ram, you know,
[1:16:46.840 --> 1:16:49.840]  take out your, you know, one gigabyte or one gigabyte.
[1:16:49.840 --> 1:16:50.840]  I mean, megabyte.
[1:16:50.840 --> 1:16:51.840]  One gigabyte.
[1:16:51.840 --> 1:16:53.840]  You're one megabyte Sims.
[1:16:53.840 --> 1:16:54.840]  Remember Sims.
[1:16:54.840 --> 1:16:55.840]  Yeah.
[1:16:55.840 --> 1:16:57.840]  And replace them with two gigabytes or whatever.
[1:16:57.840 --> 1:16:58.840]  Megabyte.
[1:16:58.840 --> 1:16:59.840]  It was easy.
[1:16:59.840 --> 1:17:00.840]  And that the clips were nice.
[1:17:00.840 --> 1:17:02.840]  Didn't feel like you were breaking the mother board.
[1:17:02.840 --> 1:17:03.840]  Absolutely.
[1:17:03.840 --> 1:17:04.840]  Everything was great.
[1:17:04.840 --> 1:17:07.840]  Especially, I mean, I'd come from history of building my own PCs,
[1:17:07.840 --> 1:17:09.840]  which was awful.
[1:17:09.840 --> 1:17:11.840]  Well, I mean, I enjoyed it at the time.
[1:17:11.840 --> 1:17:15.840]  But, you know, needing a screwdriver to get into your case was
[1:17:15.840 --> 1:17:16.840]  kind of in the ass.
[1:17:16.840 --> 1:17:21.840]  And this was the exact opposite of that experience.
[1:17:21.840 --> 1:17:26.840]  I remember, I had friends in a dorm track soul who had a built
[1:17:26.840 --> 1:17:29.840]  from scratch PC and that they ran it.
[1:17:29.840 --> 1:17:32.840]  Literally where they don't ran it with the top open.
[1:17:32.840 --> 1:17:34.840]  They just left it unscrewed.
[1:17:34.840 --> 1:17:39.840]  And they had a position, a box fan.
[1:17:39.840 --> 1:17:41.840]  Like an actual, like the thing you'd put in your window.
[1:17:41.840 --> 1:17:43.840]  They put a box fan next to it.
[1:17:43.840 --> 1:17:44.840]  To secure them.
[1:17:44.840 --> 1:17:45.840]  Yeah.
[1:17:45.840 --> 1:17:46.840]  That's awesome.
[1:17:46.840 --> 1:17:49.840]  I had just one up to you.
[1:17:49.840 --> 1:17:50.840]  Sorry.
[1:17:50.840 --> 1:17:57.840]  I built a second PC so that I could play like network games on it.
[1:17:57.840 --> 1:17:59.840]  And I didn't buy a case.
[1:17:59.840 --> 1:18:01.840]  I literally had a motherboard.
[1:18:01.840 --> 1:18:04.840]  The motherboard was sitting atop.
[1:18:04.840 --> 1:18:05.840]  I swear to God.
[1:18:05.840 --> 1:18:06.840]  I'm not making this up.
[1:18:06.840 --> 1:18:08.840]  It sounds like I'm just going to make this up.
[1:18:08.840 --> 1:18:11.840]  It was sitting atop an old issue of Macworld magazine.
[1:18:11.840 --> 1:18:13.840]  Long, long way at rest.
[1:18:13.840 --> 1:18:17.840]  There was like a motherboard with like a VGA card,
[1:18:17.840 --> 1:18:20.840]  like literally like a VGA card, a networking card.
[1:18:20.840 --> 1:18:21.840]  And I think that was it.
[1:18:21.840 --> 1:18:22.840]  There was some ram in there.
[1:18:22.840 --> 1:18:24.840]  And it was just wired up to a monitor.
[1:18:24.840 --> 1:18:27.840]  And you know where it was?
[1:18:27.840 --> 1:18:28.840]  In my closet.
[1:18:28.840 --> 1:18:29.840]  In my apartment.
[1:18:29.840 --> 1:18:32.840]  And my friends would go in there and like sit on a milk crate
[1:18:32.840 --> 1:18:35.840]  and would play Age of Empire as one.
[1:18:35.840 --> 1:18:36.840]  Not it.
[1:18:36.840 --> 1:18:42.840]  It was like the best 300 bucks had spent, but you know.
[1:18:42.840 --> 1:18:45.840]  It was like C3PO before they put the metal.
[1:18:45.840 --> 1:18:47.840]  Oh, don't even, that didn't happen.
[1:18:47.840 --> 1:18:50.840]  Don't talk about that.
[1:18:50.840 --> 1:18:53.840]  But anyway, the more I was going is that
[1:18:53.840 --> 1:18:56.840]  whatever the hiccups were, you know,
[1:18:56.840 --> 1:18:58.840]  the friction, the years of friction
[1:18:58.840 --> 1:18:59.840]  between two different cultures.
[1:18:59.840 --> 1:19:02.840]  I like to think of it in hindsight as a reunification
[1:19:02.840 --> 1:19:07.840]  that the next side that jobs created clearly had Apple DNA.
[1:19:07.840 --> 1:19:09.840]  I couldn't agree with that.
[1:19:09.840 --> 1:19:10.840]  Couldn't agree with that.
[1:19:10.840 --> 1:19:13.840]  But then they were separated by years like, you know,
[1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:17.840]  again, not to draw too dramatic an analogy,
[1:19:17.840 --> 1:19:19.840]  but like East Germany and West Germany.
[1:19:19.840 --> 1:19:21.840]  But then when the wall came down,
[1:19:21.840 --> 1:19:23.840]  yeah, it was rough for a couple of years
[1:19:23.840 --> 1:19:25.840]  because it had been so different on the two sides.
[1:19:25.840 --> 1:19:27.840]  But they're still all Germans.
[1:19:27.840 --> 1:19:28.840]  No, so I totally agree.
[1:19:28.840 --> 1:19:32.840]  So I came to this from the next point of view
[1:19:32.840 --> 1:19:37.840]  if not actually having been super invested in next.
[1:19:37.840 --> 1:19:41.840]  And I would read you and Syracuse.
[1:19:41.840 --> 1:19:45.840]  And disagree on some of the technical issues.
[1:19:45.840 --> 1:19:48.840]  But, you know, over the long run,
[1:19:48.840 --> 1:19:51.840]  I think we shared the same philosophy in a lot of ways.
[1:19:51.840 --> 1:19:52.840]  Right.
[1:19:52.840 --> 1:19:56.840]  And we're all pretty much of one-minded by this point, right?
[1:19:56.840 --> 1:19:57.840]  Right.
[1:19:57.840 --> 1:19:59.840]  Like an insatiable desire for nice things.
[1:19:59.840 --> 1:20:01.840]  Yes, exactly.
[1:20:01.840 --> 1:20:04.840]  And what you attribute to being a nice thing,
[1:20:04.840 --> 1:20:07.840]  I think has changed over the years.
[1:20:07.840 --> 1:20:08.840]  Yeah.
[1:20:08.840 --> 1:20:12.840]  But ultimately, it's the same,
[1:20:12.840 --> 1:20:14.840]  like you say, like a DNA,
[1:20:14.840 --> 1:20:16.840]  like there's a commonality there, right?
[1:20:16.840 --> 1:20:19.840]  And that, you know, once the initial friction was off.
[1:20:19.840 --> 1:20:21.840]  But, you know, in those early years,
[1:20:21.840 --> 1:20:24.840]  though, I had very strong opinions on a lot of those issues,
[1:20:24.840 --> 1:20:28.840]  and almost always aired on the side of the traditional Mac
[1:20:28.840 --> 1:20:30.840]  side of the argument.
[1:20:30.840 --> 1:20:33.840]  Yeah, your file name extensions versus, you know,
[1:20:33.840 --> 1:20:35.840]  type and creator codes, stuff like that.
[1:20:35.840 --> 1:20:37.840]  Yeah, you got it wrong so often back then.
[1:20:37.840 --> 1:20:39.840]  No, I was totally right.
[1:20:39.840 --> 1:20:41.840]  That's completely right.
[1:20:41.840 --> 1:20:42.840]  I maintain.
[1:20:42.840 --> 1:20:43.840]  I was totally right.
[1:20:43.840 --> 1:20:46.840]  The path, the stupid addressing files by path,
[1:20:46.840 --> 1:20:48.840]  instead of file ID.
[1:20:48.840 --> 1:20:49.840]  For ridiculous.
[1:20:49.840 --> 1:20:50.840]  I don't disagree.
[1:20:50.840 --> 1:20:51.840]  I don't disagree.
[1:20:51.840 --> 1:20:52.840]  But you're okay.
[1:20:52.840 --> 1:20:55.840]  This is like a 20-year-old argument at this point to get it.
[1:20:55.840 --> 1:20:56.840]  Right.
[1:20:56.840 --> 1:20:58.840]  But, you know, I mean, ultimately,
[1:20:58.840 --> 1:21:00.840]  if people had done what you wanted them to do,
[1:21:00.840 --> 1:21:03.840]  it would have been a non-starter.
[1:21:03.840 --> 1:21:04.840]  No, I don't think so.
[1:21:04.840 --> 1:21:06.840]  I think it would have.
[1:21:06.840 --> 1:21:08.840]  No, we would have gotten to where we are now anyway.
[1:21:08.840 --> 1:21:10.840]  It's just where it was.
[1:21:10.840 --> 1:21:12.840]  You wanted to use new kernel.
[1:21:12.840 --> 1:21:14.840]  No, well, I don't know.
[1:21:14.840 --> 1:21:15.840]  Did I say that?
[1:21:15.840 --> 1:21:17.840]  We said, I'm not clean.
[1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:18.840]  This is a quote.
[1:21:18.840 --> 1:21:19.840]  I'm looking at the website.
[1:21:19.840 --> 1:21:21.840]  And this is really unfair.
[1:21:21.840 --> 1:21:22.840]  Okay.
[1:21:22.840 --> 1:21:24.840]  I don't have anything from this period that you can call me on
[1:21:24.840 --> 1:21:25.840]  for being stupid.
[1:21:25.840 --> 1:21:27.840]  And I'm sure it was stupid in a lot of ways.
[1:21:27.840 --> 1:21:29.840]  And I don't even think this is stupid,
[1:21:29.840 --> 1:21:31.840]  but you literally vote.
[1:21:31.840 --> 1:21:34.840]  I'm not claiming that new kernel was perfect or superior to
[1:21:34.840 --> 1:21:36.840]  the market every way.
[1:21:36.840 --> 1:21:38.840]  I'm not in any position to make such judgments.
[1:21:38.840 --> 1:21:40.840]  That's great.
[1:21:40.840 --> 1:21:43.840]  But by all accounts, the idea of using new kernel rather than
[1:21:43.840 --> 1:21:46.840]  mock was never even considered by convenient,
[1:21:46.840 --> 1:21:49.840]  no matter what advantages it held.
[1:21:49.840 --> 1:21:51.840]  Which, yeah.
[1:21:51.840 --> 1:21:55.840]  Because swapping out a kernel under an ONS is a penny ass.
[1:21:55.840 --> 1:21:59.840]  New kernel, remember it was designed from the outset as a kernel
[1:21:59.840 --> 1:22:03.840]  to power future power PC based Mac operating systems.
[1:22:03.840 --> 1:22:06.840]  Mock wasn't.
[1:22:06.840 --> 1:22:09.840]  Wait, there's something about power management in here.
[1:22:09.840 --> 1:22:11.840]  I really want to find it.
[1:22:11.840 --> 1:22:13.840]  We're going to have to get to edit this.
[1:22:13.840 --> 1:22:15.840]  For one, superior power management,
[1:22:15.840 --> 1:22:18.840]  a continuing week spot in Mac OS 10.
[1:22:18.840 --> 1:22:19.840]  It was.
[1:22:19.840 --> 1:22:20.840]  It was.
[1:22:20.840 --> 1:22:21.840]  It was.
[1:22:21.840 --> 1:22:22.840]  It was.
[1:22:22.840 --> 1:22:24.840]  At the time, you were completely correct.
[1:22:24.840 --> 1:22:27.840]  Now it runs on your phone.
[1:22:27.840 --> 1:22:28.840]  It's very true.
[1:22:28.840 --> 1:22:29.840]  Right.
[1:22:29.840 --> 1:22:32.840]  So again, they solved it in a different way.
[1:22:32.840 --> 1:22:33.840]  You could say that right.
[1:22:33.840 --> 1:22:34.840]  But I don't know that it was.
[1:22:34.840 --> 1:22:35.840]  I'm not seeing you wrong.
[1:22:35.840 --> 1:22:36.840]  I'm just saying that.
[1:22:36.840 --> 1:22:37.840]  Right.
[1:22:37.840 --> 1:22:38.840]  Right.
[1:22:38.840 --> 1:22:39.840]  It was true.
[1:22:39.840 --> 1:22:41.840]  The flavor of the commentary was different, right?
[1:22:41.840 --> 1:22:42.840]  Right.
[1:22:42.840 --> 1:22:44.840]  Because there was a cultural divide.
[1:22:44.840 --> 1:22:46.840]  Right.
[1:22:46.840 --> 1:22:47.840]  Yeah.
[1:22:47.840 --> 1:22:50.840]  Well, you know, the kernel stuff is probably over my head.
[1:22:50.840 --> 1:22:51.840]  But.
[1:22:51.840 --> 1:22:53.840]  No, I mean, no, I'm not.
[1:22:53.840 --> 1:22:55.840]  I mean, I'm actually not trying to be a jerk here.
[1:22:55.840 --> 1:22:58.840]  No, but another part too, though, is I wasn't.
[1:22:58.840 --> 1:23:01.840]  I didn't know enough about how the next system worked.
[1:23:01.840 --> 1:23:05.840]  And I was thinking about it more from like the open step
[1:23:05.840 --> 1:23:07.840]  perspective, which maybe that was mock too.
[1:23:07.840 --> 1:23:09.840]  But I thought that was a little bit more abstract where it ran
[1:23:09.840 --> 1:23:10.840]  on Solaris.
[1:23:10.840 --> 1:23:11.840]  It was mock.
[1:23:11.840 --> 1:23:12.840]  And I had a lot of weird stuff.
[1:23:12.840 --> 1:23:13.840]  And yeah, it could.
[1:23:13.840 --> 1:23:14.840]  Well.
[1:23:14.840 --> 1:23:18.840]  But that because like that open step ran on Solaris, I thought that
[1:23:18.840 --> 1:23:20.840]  that cocoa that the cocoa layer.
[1:23:20.840 --> 1:23:21.840]  Yeah.
[1:23:21.840 --> 1:23:26.840]  You know, and I that's what I thought that more or less was I
[1:23:26.840 --> 1:23:31.840]  was thinking was that why couldn't they take cocoa and do on
[1:23:31.840 --> 1:23:34.840]  new kernel what they did to get it running on Solaris?
[1:23:34.840 --> 1:23:35.840]  Maybe that was a terrible idea.
[1:23:35.840 --> 1:23:37.840]  Maybe that, you know, that's you know what?
[1:23:37.840 --> 1:23:38.840]  I don't know.
[1:23:38.840 --> 1:23:40.840]  I honestly don't know.
[1:23:40.840 --> 1:23:43.840]  I think new kernel is probably kind of brilliant.
[1:23:43.840 --> 1:23:44.840]  Right.
[1:23:44.840 --> 1:23:47.840]  Because they even had they even had the cocoa layer running on
[1:23:47.840 --> 1:23:48.840]  Windows.
[1:23:48.840 --> 1:23:50.840]  I mean, that was they were actually and they actually thought
[1:23:50.840 --> 1:23:51.840]  maybe they'd still ship that at first.
[1:23:51.840 --> 1:23:53.840]  They were going to ship the they were going to call it
[1:23:53.840 --> 1:23:54.840]  yellow box from Windows.
[1:23:54.840 --> 1:23:55.840]  Yeah, they really could have.
[1:23:55.840 --> 1:23:59.840]  I mean, yeah, the the open step layer, the cocoa layer, as
[1:23:59.840 --> 1:24:01.840]  we thought was today, can shape on a bunch of different
[1:24:01.840 --> 1:24:05.840]  devices and to be honest, probably will in the future.
[1:24:05.840 --> 1:24:06.840]  Right.
[1:24:06.840 --> 1:24:09.840]  I feel eventually going to swap out the underpinnings.
[1:24:09.840 --> 1:24:10.840]  Right.
[1:24:10.840 --> 1:24:13.840]  I I shouldn't be passing judge and again, from a computer
[1:24:13.840 --> 1:24:14.840]  something.
[1:24:14.840 --> 1:24:16.840]  Well, you literally say I'm not in any position to make
[1:24:16.840 --> 1:24:18.840]  judgments and you said they're back in 2003.
[1:24:18.840 --> 1:24:21.840]  So I'm really not trying to be a dick about this.
[1:24:21.840 --> 1:24:22.840]  I'm just right.
[1:24:22.840 --> 1:24:23.840]  But just it's funny.
[1:24:23.840 --> 1:24:26.840]  Like it's it's worth the discussion on that.
[1:24:26.840 --> 1:24:27.840]  Right.
[1:24:27.840 --> 1:24:29.840]  But there was it was I was expressing the frustrations from a
[1:24:29.840 --> 1:24:32.840]  lot of people I knew within Apple who were there, you know,
[1:24:32.840 --> 1:24:35.840]  from the Mac side, who knew that maybe that's just one
[1:24:35.840 --> 1:24:37.840]  example, but that there was a lot of Mac stuff that wasn't
[1:24:37.840 --> 1:24:41.840]  even considered, you know, just because it was a, you know,
[1:24:41.840 --> 1:24:43.840]  if it wasn't from the next side, it was crap.
[1:24:43.840 --> 1:24:44.840]  Yes.
[1:24:44.840 --> 1:24:45.840]  Inside of things.
[1:24:45.840 --> 1:24:47.840]  And the only stuff that did survive was stuff that next didn't
[1:24:47.840 --> 1:24:50.840]  even have, you know, like QuickTime famously survived.
[1:24:50.840 --> 1:24:52.840]  And not because QuickTime had a great API.
[1:24:52.840 --> 1:24:54.840]  QuickTime had a horrible API.
[1:24:54.840 --> 1:24:56.840]  I mean, talk to anybody who ever program QuickTime.
[1:24:56.840 --> 1:24:59.840]  It's a nightmare.
[1:24:59.840 --> 1:25:01.840]  They get the shakes and bring it up.
[1:25:01.840 --> 1:25:03.840]  But it was the fact that next didn't have anything.
[1:25:03.840 --> 1:25:05.840]  They didn't have a multimedia thing.
[1:25:05.840 --> 1:25:06.840]  Yeah.
[1:25:06.840 --> 1:25:08.840]  They, you know, they needed, you know, QuickTime gave them
[1:25:08.840 --> 1:25:09.840]  something they didn't even have before.
[1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:11.840]  You couldn't even play movies on next.
[1:25:11.840 --> 1:25:12.840]  Yeah.
[1:25:12.840 --> 1:25:14.840]  Did we place QuickDrive with the courts?
[1:25:14.840 --> 1:25:15.840]  Yeah.
[1:25:15.840 --> 1:25:17.840]  Well, that was a big win because QuickDrive was, you know, I mean,
[1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:18.840]  it was just so much better.
[1:25:18.840 --> 1:25:19.840]  They did the long run.
[1:25:19.840 --> 1:25:21.840]  They did just a display post script.
[1:25:21.840 --> 1:25:22.840]  Right.
[1:25:22.840 --> 1:25:23.840]  Right.
[1:25:23.840 --> 1:25:25.840]  That was just, you know, that that was one that I don't remember
[1:25:25.840 --> 1:25:26.840]  being contentious, though.
[1:25:26.840 --> 1:25:27.840]  It might have been something.
[1:25:27.840 --> 1:25:30.840]  No, it was one of the best moves that they did with, with the worst
[1:25:30.840 --> 1:25:31.840]  time for sure.
[1:25:31.840 --> 1:25:32.840]  Right.
[1:25:32.840 --> 1:25:34.840]  And that, you know, the QuickDrive having been designed to do
[1:25:34.840 --> 1:25:39.840]  technically amazing things on 1984 and 1985 computers was not,
[1:25:39.840 --> 1:25:42.840]  did not make it relevant going into the future.
[1:25:42.840 --> 1:25:43.840]  Right.
[1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:44.840]  Yeah.
[1:25:44.840 --> 1:25:47.840]  So yeah, so courts, the compositing window server was way ahead of
[1:25:47.840 --> 1:25:48.840]  his time.
[1:25:48.840 --> 1:25:49.840]  Yeah.
[1:25:49.840 --> 1:25:54.840]  And at the time I was frustrated with Syracuse's reviews because he
[1:25:54.840 --> 1:25:56.840]  complained about resizing windows.
[1:25:56.840 --> 1:26:00.840]  Like, why do they resize with live like rather than just the
[1:26:00.840 --> 1:26:03.840]  classic Mac OS outline thing.
[1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:08.840]  And I was like, because that's cool and is awesome.
[1:26:08.840 --> 1:26:09.840]  But he's right.
[1:26:09.840 --> 1:26:14.840]  Like, I've come to see the product point of view of it where,
[1:26:14.840 --> 1:26:18.840]  you know, resizing it five frames per second is not, that's not
[1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:19.840]  tenable.
[1:26:19.840 --> 1:26:22.840]  It's dumb.
[1:26:22.840 --> 1:26:26.840]  I remember at the time, that was the years that I was working at
[1:26:26.840 --> 1:26:27.840]  bare bones software.
[1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:32.840]  And we'd get, we'd get new developer betas of, of OS 10 and
[1:26:32.840 --> 1:26:34.840]  install them on, you know, really good hardware.
[1:26:34.840 --> 1:26:35.840]  Yeah.
[1:26:35.840 --> 1:26:37.840]  It wasn't like we were installing it on, on chippy stuff.
[1:26:37.840 --> 1:26:42.840]  And I remember watching, Jim Korea, who's now at, at Omni group
[1:26:42.840 --> 1:26:44.840]  with all the, yeah, damn,
[1:26:44.840 --> 1:26:45.840]  just fellas.
[1:26:45.840 --> 1:26:46.840]  Yeah.
[1:26:46.840 --> 1:26:49.840]  But Jim would, Jim would just open a window and first he would
[1:26:49.840 --> 1:26:52.840]  grab the corner and resize it really, really fast.
[1:26:52.840 --> 1:26:53.840]  And his eyes would start to roll.
[1:26:53.840 --> 1:26:56.840]  Then he could just grab the, then he'd grab the window title bar
[1:26:56.840 --> 1:26:59.840]  and just shake it over the screen as fast as he could.
[1:26:59.840 --> 1:27:01.840]  And you'd see all of this shearing.
[1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:04.840]  I mean, it was just, there's no way that it could keep up with,
[1:27:04.840 --> 1:27:06.840]  you know, Jim's hand just go inside the side.
[1:27:06.840 --> 1:27:09.840]  And they would just roll, you know, just sigh and walk away.
[1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:11.840]  So it was so bad.
[1:27:11.840 --> 1:27:12.840]  You know what, that's funny though.
[1:27:12.840 --> 1:27:15.840]  It's, what I think is so interesting though is that in between
[1:27:15.840 --> 1:27:20.840]  2002, 2001 Apple, which went for looks beautiful,
[1:27:20.840 --> 1:27:22.840]  even if it is painfully slow.
[1:27:22.840 --> 1:27:23.840]  Mm hmm.
[1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:28.840]  To 2006 Apple, making the first version of iOS, which looked
[1:27:28.840 --> 1:27:29.840]  beautiful.
[1:27:29.840 --> 1:27:35.840]  Um, but never got slow was that it was a subtle shift in priorities
[1:27:35.840 --> 1:27:38.840]  where I disagree with that characterization.
[1:27:38.840 --> 1:27:39.840]  But, sorry.
[1:27:39.840 --> 1:27:40.840]  Well, here's the example though.
[1:27:40.840 --> 1:27:44.840]  The example is you load during Fireball and mobile Safari on
[1:27:44.840 --> 1:27:46.840]  the original iPhone running iOS 1.0.
[1:27:46.840 --> 1:27:47.840]  And you start to scroll.
[1:27:47.840 --> 1:27:48.840]  What do you see?
[1:27:48.840 --> 1:27:49.840]  You saw that checkerboard.
[1:27:49.840 --> 1:27:50.840]  Remember the checkerboard and iOS?
[1:27:50.840 --> 1:27:51.840]  Yeah.
[1:27:51.840 --> 1:27:55.840]  So the scrolling always kept up with your finger, but they would
[1:27:55.840 --> 1:27:58.840]  just dump the content and show a checkerboard if they needed to.
[1:27:58.840 --> 1:28:01.840]  So it always felt like it was perfectly responsive with your finger.
[1:28:01.840 --> 1:28:07.840]  So, you know, it, but it wasn't showing you the, the content in
[1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:08.840]  high fidelity.
[1:28:08.840 --> 1:28:10.840]  And in fact, with the checkerboard, it would just drop it
[1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:11.840]  completely.
[1:28:11.840 --> 1:28:14.840]  And I thought, you know, I thought that was one of the most genius
[1:28:14.840 --> 1:28:18.840]  decisions in all of the original iOS 1.0 was that checkerboard.
[1:28:18.840 --> 1:28:23.840]  Uh, of course, you know, clearly the ultimate answer was to just
[1:28:23.840 --> 1:28:26.840]  keep up with your finger with the actual content, which is what
[1:28:26.840 --> 1:28:28.840]  all iPhones do today.
[1:28:28.840 --> 1:28:33.840]  But in terms of what they should do then, the, the Mac OS 10 1.0
[1:28:33.840 --> 1:28:37.840]  solution would have been for the iOS to do really jittery,
[1:28:37.840 --> 1:28:42.840]  you know, sharing, scrolling have scrolling get real slow as you
[1:28:42.840 --> 1:28:44.840]  scroll a big long live page.
[1:28:44.840 --> 1:28:47.840]  And what they came up with in 2007 was delightful.
[1:28:47.840 --> 1:28:50.840]  It actually, even though it was disappointing and it's
[1:28:50.840 --> 1:28:52.840]  slightly at first that, oh, it can't keep the whole page there.
[1:28:52.840 --> 1:28:56.840]  But the fact that it, no matter what you did, what you saw, those
[1:28:56.840 --> 1:28:58.840]  checkerboards moving up in the screen kept pace with your finger
[1:28:58.840 --> 1:29:00.840]  was to me delightful.
[1:29:00.840 --> 1:29:02.840]  So I, I agree.
[1:29:02.840 --> 1:29:04.840]  I was initially not a disagree.
[1:29:04.840 --> 1:29:09.840]  Yeah, the, the, the checker, the instant interaction is
[1:29:09.840 --> 1:29:12.840]  always better.
[1:29:12.840 --> 1:29:17.840]  Uh, what I liked about Mac OS 10 at the time when it was
[1:29:17.840 --> 1:29:20.840]  released was that it was betting on the future.
[1:29:20.840 --> 1:29:21.840]  Like hard.
[1:29:21.840 --> 1:29:24.840]  Like harder than it really should have because at the time
[1:29:24.840 --> 1:29:29.840]  when it shipped the product, I liked because I, I was more
[1:29:29.840 --> 1:29:32.840]  on the nerdy side of the scale like I could see what they
[1:29:32.840 --> 1:29:34.840]  were doing.
[1:29:34.840 --> 1:29:37.840]  Um, but it wasn't a great product.
[1:29:37.840 --> 1:29:40.840]  Well, and it's harder to bet on the future when you're
[1:29:40.840 --> 1:29:41.840]  behind.
[1:29:41.840 --> 1:29:42.840]  Right.
[1:29:42.840 --> 1:29:43.840]  But they did.
[1:29:43.840 --> 1:29:44.840]  Right.
[1:29:44.840 --> 1:29:45.840]  They bet hard.
[1:29:45.840 --> 1:29:46.840]  And, you know, Microsoft had to catch up years later with Vista,
[1:29:46.840 --> 1:29:49.840]  which, right, comically late to the game at that point, right?
[1:29:49.840 --> 1:29:50.840]  Right.
[1:29:50.840 --> 1:29:52.840]  Well, and, and, and at the same time that OS 10 was
[1:29:52.840 --> 1:29:55.840]  shipping more or less, roughly 2000, 2001.
[1:29:55.840 --> 1:29:58.840]  I mean, 2001 was actually when XP shipped.
[1:29:58.840 --> 1:29:59.840]  Yeah.
[1:29:59.840 --> 1:30:02.840]  And I think that stuff was shipping what would go on to be the
[1:30:02.840 --> 1:30:04.840]  single most popular version of Windows that ever shipped.
[1:30:04.840 --> 1:30:05.840]  Right.
[1:30:05.840 --> 1:30:07.840]  And I think it's quite possible.
[1:30:07.840 --> 1:30:09.840]  Maybe it, that ever will ship.
[1:30:09.840 --> 1:30:13.840]  They might be in some, if not a decline, like they've hit a
[1:30:13.840 --> 1:30:14.840]  permanent plateau.
[1:30:14.840 --> 1:30:15.840]  Yeah.
[1:30:15.840 --> 1:30:16.840]  You know, never be as popular.
[1:30:16.840 --> 1:30:19.840]  No new version of Windows will ever be as popular as XP was.
[1:30:19.840 --> 1:30:20.840]  Yeah.
[1:30:20.840 --> 1:30:21.840]  Do you find that?
[1:30:21.840 --> 1:30:23.840]  Do you, do you, I find that a bit of a bummer.
[1:30:23.840 --> 1:30:24.840]  I don't know how you feel about that.
[1:30:24.840 --> 1:30:27.840]  No, I think it's do, I think it's a little depressing because
[1:30:27.840 --> 1:30:29.840]  it would be better, you know, best thing that, you know,
[1:30:29.840 --> 1:30:32.840]  it's clearly one of the best things that happened to the iOS is
[1:30:32.840 --> 1:30:35.840]  Android getting its design act together.
[1:30:35.840 --> 1:30:36.840]  Right.
[1:30:36.840 --> 1:30:37.840]  Yeah.
[1:30:37.840 --> 1:30:38.840]  Whether, you know,
[1:30:38.840 --> 1:30:42.840]  Well, I mean, so I'm not that much of a, you know, the market
[1:30:42.840 --> 1:30:45.840]  is God kind of, kind of person.
[1:30:45.840 --> 1:30:48.840]  I just like to see everybody doing awesome stuff all of the
[1:30:48.840 --> 1:30:52.840]  time and it's not happening, right?
[1:30:52.840 --> 1:30:53.840]  Right.
[1:30:53.840 --> 1:30:54.840]  Right.
[1:30:54.840 --> 1:30:56.840]  It would be better, it's just better in general if other
[1:30:56.840 --> 1:30:57.840]  stuffs and it's also.
[1:30:57.840 --> 1:30:58.840]  Yeah.
[1:30:58.840 --> 1:30:59.840]  Yeah.
[1:30:59.840 --> 1:31:01.840]  But, you know, and then from a more objective point of view,
[1:31:01.840 --> 1:31:03.840]  it does keep everybody on their toes.
[1:31:03.840 --> 1:31:04.840]  Oh, yes.
[1:31:04.840 --> 1:31:05.840]  Yeah.
[1:31:05.840 --> 1:31:06.840]  Yeah.
[1:31:06.840 --> 1:31:10.840]  You know, just going back to the main thesis of this episode
[1:31:10.840 --> 1:31:14.840]  where we're talking about is Apple doing too much per year.
[1:31:14.840 --> 1:31:17.840]  Maybe it's better if they do a little bit too much per year than
[1:31:17.840 --> 1:31:20.840]  do a little too little to a per year, right?
[1:31:20.840 --> 1:31:23.840]  As a general rule of thumb, if they have to err on one side or
[1:31:23.840 --> 1:31:26.840]  not, and because humans are imperfect and because software
[1:31:26.840 --> 1:31:31.840]  planning is imperfect and software management is imperfect.
[1:31:31.840 --> 1:31:33.840]  And software engineering is certainly imperfect.
[1:31:33.840 --> 1:31:35.840]  You're never going to get exactly right.
[1:31:35.840 --> 1:31:38.840]  So if you're have to take a guess whether you're going to go a
[1:31:38.840 --> 1:31:40.840]  little too fast or a little too slow, it might be better to go too
[1:31:40.840 --> 1:31:41.840]  fast.
[1:31:41.840 --> 1:31:42.840]  So, you know,
[1:31:42.840 --> 1:31:43.840]  Yeah.
[1:31:43.840 --> 1:31:46.840]  Well, and so I agree with you, but I'm going to have to,
[1:31:46.840 --> 1:31:50.840]  I'm going to play devil's advocate for the sake of conversation.
[1:31:50.840 --> 1:31:55.840]  Um, just before the show, you sent me the link that says that iOS
[1:31:55.840 --> 1:32:00.840]  eight adoptions has stagnated compared to iOS seven adoption.
[1:32:00.840 --> 1:32:02.840]  Um,
[1:32:02.840 --> 1:32:07.840]  if that keeps happening, that is, that's a bad sign, right?
[1:32:07.840 --> 1:32:10.840]  I think this, it's, I think it's a really bad sign.
[1:32:10.840 --> 1:32:14.840]  So it's, um, and these are Apple's own numbers, right?
[1:32:14.840 --> 1:32:16.840]  Which is, it's really interesting.
[1:32:16.840 --> 1:32:18.840]  I don't want to say damning, but, right.
[1:32:18.840 --> 1:32:21.840]  So Apple, Apple has a web page on there.
[1:32:21.840 --> 1:32:24.840]  It's the App Store support page for developers.
[1:32:24.840 --> 1:32:28.840]  And it tells you at like a, it's like a once a week snapshot.
[1:32:28.840 --> 1:32:29.840]  I think it's once a week.
[1:32:29.840 --> 1:32:30.840]  I don't know.
[1:32:30.840 --> 1:32:33.840]  As we record today on October 7th, the data comes from October 5th,
[1:32:33.840 --> 1:32:35.840]  um, two days ago.
[1:32:35.840 --> 1:32:40.840]  And it just tells you of devices that have come to the App Store in the last,
[1:32:40.840 --> 1:32:42.840]  I don't know, is it a week or something like that.
[1:32:42.840 --> 1:32:44.840]  Here's what OS they were running.
[1:32:44.840 --> 1:32:48.840]  And as of, you know, 20 days after the release of iOS eight,
[1:32:48.840 --> 1:32:50.840]  it's about a 50 50 split.
[1:32:50.840 --> 1:32:54.840]  iOS seven is at 47%, iOS eight is at 47%.
[1:32:54.840 --> 1:32:57.840]  And earlier versions, the remaining six percent.
[1:32:57.840 --> 1:32:59.840]  The reason that's bad, that's, that's,
[1:32:59.840 --> 1:33:03.840]  I mean, to be fair, that's better than most other people in the industry.
[1:33:03.840 --> 1:33:06.840]  Yeah, but, yeah, it's really a year ago,
[1:33:06.840 --> 1:33:10.840]  iOS seven 20 days after it came out was at 70%.
[1:33:10.840 --> 1:33:11.840]  Right.
[1:33:11.840 --> 1:33:13.840]  Which is not, it's not like that's well with, you know,
[1:33:13.840 --> 1:33:18.840]  outside like a statistical variation.
[1:33:18.840 --> 1:33:20.840]  You know, that's a big difference.
[1:33:20.840 --> 1:33:23.840]  That's what is at 24%.
[1:33:23.840 --> 1:33:26.840]  And, you know, there might be,
[1:33:26.840 --> 1:33:29.840]  almost certainly it's multifaceted the reasons why,
[1:33:29.840 --> 1:33:31.840]  but I don't think it's outlandish at all.
[1:33:31.840 --> 1:33:36.840]  I think it's almost certain that part of it is that people
[1:33:36.840 --> 1:33:41.840]  out there feel like they've either had bad experiences in the past
[1:33:41.840 --> 1:33:45.840]  when they've okayed the, okay, a software update is available.
[1:33:45.840 --> 1:33:47.840]  Do you want to install it?
[1:33:47.840 --> 1:33:51.840]  And now they're more likely to hit cancel than they were otherwise.
[1:33:51.840 --> 1:33:55.840]  Or it's just what they're hearing from people about iOS eight.
[1:33:55.840 --> 1:33:58.840]  Oh, don't do it, you know, wait.
[1:33:58.840 --> 1:34:04.840]  I've, as I said, I told Adrian not to update.
[1:34:04.840 --> 1:34:08.840]  And she'd already heard it from people who work.
[1:34:08.840 --> 1:34:13.840]  Uh, that's, that's a bad sign.
[1:34:13.840 --> 1:34:14.840]  Like that.
[1:34:14.840 --> 1:34:16.840]  You can't do that.
[1:34:16.840 --> 1:34:17.840]  Yeah.
[1:34:17.840 --> 1:34:18.840]  Like Ben Thompson.
[1:34:18.840 --> 1:34:20.840]  And last week's episode of this show with Ben Thompson,
[1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:22.840]  I just said offhand, I said, you know,
[1:34:22.840 --> 1:34:23.840]  that's the long term.
[1:34:23.840 --> 1:34:25.840]  If they keep having a West releases like that,
[1:34:25.840 --> 1:34:29.840]  it seems inevitable that it's going to slow the pace of adoption,
[1:34:29.840 --> 1:34:31.840]  which is not an Apple's interest.
[1:34:31.840 --> 1:34:33.840]  And it's not in the interest of third party developers.
[1:34:33.840 --> 1:34:37.840]  Like it's been a very virtuous circle for Apple
[1:34:37.840 --> 1:34:40.840]  because their newest features are in front of more people.
[1:34:40.840 --> 1:34:43.840]  And it, you know, if it works well,
[1:34:43.840 --> 1:34:46.840]  it makes people feel like, hey, my, my year old iPhone is even better
[1:34:46.840 --> 1:34:49.840]  than it was a year ago because I've got these cool new features.
[1:34:49.840 --> 1:34:52.840]  And it's good for developers because when new,
[1:34:52.840 --> 1:34:55.840]  new developer technologies come out,
[1:34:55.840 --> 1:34:59.840]  they can adopt them quicker than, you know, right away.
[1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:02.840]  You know, like the new auto layout stuff and adaptive,
[1:35:02.840 --> 1:35:06.840]  uh, size stuff for new screens.
[1:35:06.840 --> 1:35:08.840]  You can do that, even though it's iOS 8 only,
[1:35:08.840 --> 1:35:11.840]  because Apple promises that, you know,
[1:35:11.840 --> 1:35:14.840]  a majority of customers are going to be running iOS 8 very soon.
[1:35:14.840 --> 1:35:21.840]  Well, I think like, it's almost absurd that you can,
[1:35:21.840 --> 1:35:26.840]  um, like a great lens to look at Apple
[1:35:26.840 --> 1:35:30.840]  is to look at the, the audio priorities, right?
[1:35:30.840 --> 1:35:32.840]  Which is at this point pretty basic.
[1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:34.840]  It's Apple, their customers,
[1:35:34.840 --> 1:35:36.840]  and then third party developers.
[1:35:36.840 --> 1:35:37.840]  Right.
[1:35:37.840 --> 1:35:43.840]  Uh, I think that, you know, shipping buggy OS updates
[1:35:43.840 --> 1:35:46.840]  initially hurts their own customers,
[1:35:46.840 --> 1:35:48.840]  and that's probably what they care about the most, right?
[1:35:48.840 --> 1:35:49.840]  Yep. Yeah.
[1:35:49.840 --> 1:35:50.840]  And then the customers won't update,
[1:35:50.840 --> 1:35:53.840]  and that's going to trickle down into third party developers.
[1:35:53.840 --> 1:35:54.840]  Right.
[1:35:54.840 --> 1:35:56.840]  And then that's the, you know, given the cycle of life,
[1:35:56.840 --> 1:36:01.840]  like the feedback loop, if third party developers can't count on
[1:36:01.840 --> 1:36:04.840]  customers, how many up the OS updated,
[1:36:04.840 --> 1:36:07.840]  they can't adopt the good, the good stuff that Apple
[1:36:07.840 --> 1:36:10.840]  who's released and wants people to do.
[1:36:10.840 --> 1:36:14.840]  Uh, it's, it's a horrible cycle.
[1:36:14.840 --> 1:36:19.840]  So, uh, yeah.
[1:36:19.840 --> 1:36:22.840]  As a developer that sucks that, you know,
[1:36:22.840 --> 1:36:24.840]  maybe I can't count on these new things,
[1:36:24.840 --> 1:36:30.840]  but I think, I think Apple should probably
[1:36:30.840 --> 1:36:32.840]  serve their customers first.
[1:36:32.840 --> 1:36:35.840]  Like, I understand the priority system.
[1:36:35.840 --> 1:36:39.840]  I think they've failed their own customers in a certain way.
[1:36:39.840 --> 1:36:40.840]  Yeah.
[1:36:40.840 --> 1:36:41.840]  To some small degree, you know.
[1:36:41.840 --> 1:36:42.840]  Yeah.
[1:36:42.840 --> 1:36:44.840]  It might be, you know, that you can't,
[1:36:44.840 --> 1:36:47.840]  oh, overestimate,
[1:36:47.840 --> 1:36:49.840]  underestimate.
[1:36:49.840 --> 1:36:50.840]  I don't know.
[1:36:50.840 --> 1:36:52.840]  Whichever way it works.
[1:36:52.840 --> 1:36:55.840]  How much damage you can do to the trust
[1:36:55.840 --> 1:36:58.840]  between the typical user,
[1:36:58.840 --> 1:37:02.840]  which of which there are now hundreds of millions of them.
[1:37:02.840 --> 1:37:03.840]  Exactly.
[1:37:03.840 --> 1:37:04.840]  So they're not technical people at all.
[1:37:04.840 --> 1:37:06.840]  They're just people who want to have an iPhone
[1:37:06.840 --> 1:37:08.840]  that works or an iPad.
[1:37:08.840 --> 1:37:11.840]  Um, and the trust that they have in Apple
[1:37:11.840 --> 1:37:14.840]  when that dialogue box comes up and says a new version
[1:37:14.840 --> 1:37:16.840]  of iOS 8 is available for your device.
[1:37:16.840 --> 1:37:18.840]  Click, you know, tap here to install.
[1:37:18.840 --> 1:37:21.840]  Cause I think once you said no once,
[1:37:21.840 --> 1:37:24.840]  why would you not say no again,
[1:37:24.840 --> 1:37:26.840]  the second time like with,
[1:37:26.840 --> 1:37:28.840]  you have to,
[1:37:28.840 --> 1:37:30.840]  you've been trained that everything's great
[1:37:30.840 --> 1:37:32.840]  and then something beat you.
[1:37:32.840 --> 1:37:33.840]  Yeah.
[1:37:33.840 --> 1:37:35.840]  There's a little boy who cried wolf and go to it.
[1:37:35.840 --> 1:37:37.840]  And there's slightly a bad metaphor
[1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:39.840]  because the kid in that allegory is a liar.
[1:37:39.840 --> 1:37:41.840]  And Apple's not doing this on purpose.
[1:37:41.840 --> 1:37:42.840]  They're not lying.
[1:37:42.840 --> 1:37:43.840]  No, no.
[1:37:43.840 --> 1:37:44.840]  Clearly everybody with an Apple wishes
[1:37:44.840 --> 1:37:46.840]  that all these features worked perfectly.
[1:37:46.840 --> 1:37:48.840]  Also, I hate that story cause it's dumb.
[1:37:48.840 --> 1:37:50.840]  Just show up every time that kid calls wolf.
[1:37:50.840 --> 1:37:51.840]  Like just do it.
[1:37:51.840 --> 1:37:52.840]  Like what?
[1:37:52.840 --> 1:37:54.840]  Just to point a new kid,
[1:37:54.840 --> 1:37:56.840]  get the kid off of it.
[1:37:56.840 --> 1:37:58.840]  There's better solutions to this problem.
[1:37:58.840 --> 1:37:59.840]  Yeah, you know what?
[1:37:59.840 --> 1:38:00.840]  You're going to work,
[1:38:00.840 --> 1:38:02.840]  you're going to work inside from now on.
[1:38:02.840 --> 1:38:04.840]  Anyway, sorry, I caught you up.
[1:38:04.840 --> 1:38:09.840]  But the townspeople's reaction though is human nature.
[1:38:09.840 --> 1:38:11.840]  Where if you feel like you've been burned a couple times
[1:38:11.840 --> 1:38:13.840]  and you feel like, hey, you know,
[1:38:13.840 --> 1:38:16.840]  my iPad got kind of slow when I installed iOS 7.
[1:38:16.840 --> 1:38:19.840]  It is going to make you less likely to do it.
[1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:22.840]  And I know that that whole aspect gets,
[1:38:22.840 --> 1:38:26.840]  you know, the jackass way to overstate it
[1:38:26.840 --> 1:38:28.840]  is that whole thing that came up last year
[1:38:28.840 --> 1:38:30.840]  where that it was planned obsolescence.
[1:38:30.840 --> 1:38:32.840]  And that infuriated me.
[1:38:32.840 --> 1:38:36.840]  Well, and I think now we're seeing why it's so infuriating, right?
[1:38:36.840 --> 1:38:39.840]  So last year there were people like in the New York Times
[1:38:39.840 --> 1:38:41.840]  I forget who, but a couple people chirping in that,
[1:38:41.840 --> 1:38:43.840]  hey, I upgraded my old iPhone.
[1:38:43.840 --> 1:38:45.840]  It's a year old or it's two years old.
[1:38:45.840 --> 1:38:46.840]  And now it's slower.
[1:38:46.840 --> 1:38:49.840]  Apple did that on purpose because I want me to buy a new iPhone.
[1:38:49.840 --> 1:38:51.840]  And I thought that was so stupid
[1:38:51.840 --> 1:38:54.840]  because it has so little respect for people.
[1:38:54.840 --> 1:38:56.840]  Like if Apple had done that on purpose,
[1:38:56.840 --> 1:38:58.840]  isn't it a natural response for somebody who says,
[1:38:58.840 --> 1:39:01.840]  hey, I paid a lot of money for my iPhone.
[1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:04.840]  I did what Apple told me to do and it got slower.
[1:39:04.840 --> 1:39:07.840]  Maybe I should try a Samsung phone or something.
[1:39:07.840 --> 1:39:10.840]  I mean, that seems a little bit of cut to the market.
[1:39:10.840 --> 1:39:12.840]  He kind of thing for me personally.
[1:39:12.840 --> 1:39:13.840]  But I see you point.
[1:39:13.840 --> 1:39:15.840]  I understand where you can.
[1:39:15.840 --> 1:39:17.840]  That's a perfectly rational reaction to it.
[1:39:17.840 --> 1:39:18.840]  Yeah.
[1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:19.840]  You know, that's what I would think.
[1:39:19.840 --> 1:39:22.840]  It had been the case, yes, but yeah.
[1:39:22.840 --> 1:39:25.840]  Take the politics out of the fact that Android versus iOS
[1:39:25.840 --> 1:39:29.840]  is sort of a political thing where we've got tribes,
[1:39:29.840 --> 1:39:32.840]  you know, that you and I are part of this, you know,
[1:39:32.840 --> 1:39:34.840]  Mac, Indy Mac, iOS.
[1:39:34.840 --> 1:39:37.840]  Yeah, I'd like to pretend that I'm not, but yeah, but fair enough.
[1:39:37.840 --> 1:39:38.840]  Yeah.
[1:39:38.840 --> 1:39:40.840]  Take it to something where there's less religious,
[1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:42.840]  you know, religious style fervor.
[1:39:42.840 --> 1:39:44.840]  And we try, I do hope that I do too,
[1:39:44.840 --> 1:39:46.840]  that I kind of try to stay above that
[1:39:46.840 --> 1:39:48.840]  and keep my mind open as best I can.
[1:39:48.840 --> 1:39:50.840]  I know that's be honest, you know.
[1:39:50.840 --> 1:39:52.840]  And it's there and the people who listen to our show
[1:39:52.840 --> 1:39:54.840]  and stuff like that, but just I'm just saying
[1:39:54.840 --> 1:39:56.840]  that like if you buy,
[1:39:56.840 --> 1:39:59.840]  let's take two brands that are really close and intertwined
[1:39:59.840 --> 1:40:01.840]  in their histories and in their reputations,
[1:40:01.840 --> 1:40:02.840]  Honda and Toyota, right?
[1:40:02.840 --> 1:40:04.840]  That they're both Japanese and they both have
[1:40:04.840 --> 1:40:07.840]  this reputation for quality and for durability
[1:40:07.840 --> 1:40:09.840]  that, you know, you can buy a Honda or Toyota
[1:40:09.840 --> 1:40:11.840]  and it's very good likelihood it's going to last
[1:40:11.840 --> 1:40:13.840]  for over 100,000 miles.
[1:40:13.840 --> 1:40:16.840]  And that, you know, you bought Toyota's two or three
[1:40:16.840 --> 1:40:18.840]  cars in a row and then you buy a Toyota
[1:40:18.840 --> 1:40:20.840]  and you get a bad one and it's, you know,
[1:40:20.840 --> 1:40:23.840]  it has transmission problems two years in.
[1:40:23.840 --> 1:40:25.840]  Doesn't that make you more likely to think,
[1:40:25.840 --> 1:40:27.840]  hey, maybe I should try a Honda next time, right?
[1:40:27.840 --> 1:40:30.840]  It doesn't make you think I bet Toyota did this on purpose
[1:40:30.840 --> 1:40:32.840]  because they want me to buy another car, right?
[1:40:32.840 --> 1:40:34.840]  That's just, it's counter to the brand
[1:40:34.840 --> 1:40:37.840]  and the Apple brand is we make good stuff
[1:40:37.840 --> 1:40:40.840]  and it lasts at least in terms of technology
[1:40:40.840 --> 1:40:43.840]  where it lasts long and anything that
[1:40:43.840 --> 1:40:46.840]  goes against that is off the brand and off the message
[1:40:46.840 --> 1:40:48.840]  and off the relationship that they want to have
[1:40:48.840 --> 1:40:50.840]  with their customers.
[1:40:50.840 --> 1:40:53.840]  So I really think that that whole idea
[1:40:53.840 --> 1:40:55.840]  that it's planned obsolescence
[1:40:55.840 --> 1:40:58.840]  that new versions of iOS run poorly on
[1:40:58.840 --> 1:41:02.840]  or less even less than ideally on older devices,
[1:41:02.840 --> 1:41:05.840]  it's not just wrong because I know from the people
[1:41:05.840 --> 1:41:07.840]  I know at Apple, people I know at Apple would quit
[1:41:07.840 --> 1:41:10.840]  if they were told, hey, make this run slow on an iPhone.
[1:41:10.840 --> 1:41:13.840]  No, it doesn't really.
[1:41:13.840 --> 1:41:14.840]  I mean that sincerely.
[1:41:14.840 --> 1:41:17.840]  I had the conversation with a friend at WWDC
[1:41:17.840 --> 1:41:19.840]  who were all desires about it and said literally,
[1:41:19.840 --> 1:41:20.840]  I would quit.
[1:41:20.840 --> 1:41:22.840]  If my boss came into me and told me to do something like that
[1:41:22.840 --> 1:41:24.840]  I would just, I would just say, okay,
[1:41:24.840 --> 1:41:25.840]  and then I would just pack up my stuff
[1:41:25.840 --> 1:41:27.840]  because I get a job somewhere else.
[1:41:27.840 --> 1:41:29.840]  I'm not gonna, you know, why would I do something like that?
[1:41:29.840 --> 1:41:31.840]  That's, you know, evils are wrong.
[1:41:31.840 --> 1:41:33.840]  That's not what he said, but I would have no respect
[1:41:33.840 --> 1:41:34.840]  for myself if I did that.
[1:41:34.840 --> 1:41:35.840]  That's not how they do this.
[1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:36.840]  No, that's.
[1:41:36.840 --> 1:41:40.840]  But it's kind of a terrible Apple, if anything,
[1:41:40.840 --> 1:41:44.840]  Apple is facing a crisis of talent retention.
[1:41:44.840 --> 1:41:45.840]  Yeah.
[1:41:45.840 --> 1:41:47.840]  And that's the sort of thing that makes me worse.
[1:41:47.840 --> 1:41:48.840]  And believe me, if you start being like,
[1:41:48.840 --> 1:41:50.840]  well, you know what, cripple a phone in a year.
[1:41:50.840 --> 1:41:51.840]  Right.
[1:41:51.840 --> 1:41:52.840]  It's like, oh, fuck you.
[1:41:52.840 --> 1:41:54.840]  I'll go, well, that, just,
[1:41:54.840 --> 1:41:57.840]  damage money that can get elsewhere.
[1:41:57.840 --> 1:41:58.840]  Like it's fine.
[1:41:58.840 --> 1:42:01.840]  Like these people can get a job wherever they want.
[1:42:01.840 --> 1:42:03.840]  The people I know at Apple are the opposite
[1:42:03.840 --> 1:42:05.840]  where they would take pride in the fact that, you know,
[1:42:05.840 --> 1:42:07.840]  I worked on, you know,
[1:42:07.840 --> 1:42:09.840]  I don't know, I worked on, you know,
[1:42:09.840 --> 1:42:11.840]  the UI list view scrolling.
[1:42:11.840 --> 1:42:12.840]  Yeah.
[1:42:12.840 --> 1:42:14.840]  And it's still buttery smooth on an iPhone for us.
[1:42:14.840 --> 1:42:16.840]  I totally agree with you.
[1:42:16.840 --> 1:42:17.840]  Right.
[1:42:17.840 --> 1:42:19.840]  And that's like, that's a feather in my cap that it's, you know,
[1:42:19.840 --> 1:42:20.840]  that one hundred.
[1:42:20.840 --> 1:42:24.840]  One hundred percent nobody is trying to make anything slow.
[1:42:24.840 --> 1:42:25.840]  Right.
[1:42:25.840 --> 1:42:28.840]  And I think that this thing to go back to this, you know,
[1:42:28.840 --> 1:42:33.840]  that the upgrade pace is apparently significantly off year
[1:42:33.840 --> 1:42:37.840]  over year is to me, like I said, a canary in a coal mine
[1:42:37.840 --> 1:42:40.840]  that those sort of, hey, if you keep doing this,
[1:42:40.840 --> 1:42:43.840]  it's going to affect it, that it's come to fruition.
[1:42:43.840 --> 1:42:45.840]  That we've got a dead canary here.
[1:42:45.840 --> 1:42:47.840]  I feel like it's a sprinter that is,
[1:42:47.840 --> 1:42:50.840]  he just tried that's like a little bit off
[1:42:50.840 --> 1:42:52.840]  and it's almost stumbling at this point.
[1:42:52.840 --> 1:42:53.840]  Right.
[1:42:53.840 --> 1:42:56.840]  And instead of saying like, hey, this could happen, you know,
[1:42:56.840 --> 1:42:59.840]  it's actually happening and we're seeing, you know,
[1:42:59.840 --> 1:43:02.840]  here, the last lap around the track was slower.
[1:43:02.840 --> 1:43:03.840]  Right.
[1:43:03.840 --> 1:43:04.840]  Exactly.
[1:43:04.840 --> 1:43:05.840]  It's not just, it's not just you and I,
[1:43:05.840 --> 1:43:08.840]  the commentators and the booth speculating that maybe he's slower,
[1:43:08.840 --> 1:43:10.840]  the runner is slower, that it's, hey, you know,
[1:43:10.840 --> 1:43:11.840]  you clock it.
[1:43:11.840 --> 1:43:12.840]  Yeah.
[1:43:12.840 --> 1:43:13.840]  Yeah, the pace is off.
[1:43:13.840 --> 1:43:14.840]  Very, very worrisome to me.
[1:43:14.840 --> 1:43:16.840]  I haven't linked it up on during fire.
[1:43:16.840 --> 1:43:18.840]  I probably will before the show hits, but I think it's,
[1:43:18.840 --> 1:43:20.840]  and there's a couple, somebody else has data
[1:43:20.840 --> 1:43:22.840]  that backs it up to mix panel.
[1:43:22.840 --> 1:43:23.840]  I don't know who they are.
[1:43:23.840 --> 1:43:25.840]  But the stuff from Apple, I trust.
[1:43:25.840 --> 1:43:26.840]  Yeah.
[1:43:26.840 --> 1:43:27.840]  I mean, it's the wrong numbers.
[1:43:27.840 --> 1:43:32.840]  Right. So kind of, I'd imagine you can hold them
[1:43:32.840 --> 1:43:33.840]  to their own numbers.
[1:43:33.840 --> 1:43:36.840]  I don't know why you wouldn't want to.
[1:43:36.840 --> 1:43:39.840]  I think, I think that they'll, it's not like,
[1:43:39.840 --> 1:43:40.840]  and I don't think it's too late.
[1:43:40.840 --> 1:43:42.840]  I don't think they can not turn, you know, but I feel
[1:43:42.840 --> 1:43:48.840]  like they've got a shift priorities subtly in favor
[1:43:48.840 --> 1:43:52.840]  of higher quality, even at the expense of doing less
[1:43:52.840 --> 1:43:55.840]  in the same amount of time.
[1:43:55.840 --> 1:43:58.840]  Well, I mean, is it too late for the next cycle?
[1:43:58.840 --> 1:43:59.840]  I don't know.
[1:43:59.840 --> 1:44:00.840]  Yeah, I don't know.
[1:44:00.840 --> 1:44:04.840]  Mark German reported that nine to five Mac,
[1:44:04.840 --> 1:44:09.840]  that they've got 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3 in testing,
[1:44:09.840 --> 1:44:12.840]  which is different than all, most previous years,
[1:44:12.840 --> 1:44:15.840]  they've only done a 0.1.
[1:44:15.840 --> 1:44:18.840]  And I, you know, who knows if that's the case or not?
[1:44:18.840 --> 1:44:20.840]  It was unclear from his report how much of that
[1:44:20.840 --> 1:44:23.840]  was just coming from user agent strings that they saw
[1:44:23.840 --> 1:44:25.840]  at nine to five Mac in Google Analytics,
[1:44:25.840 --> 1:44:26.840]  which are easily fake.
[1:44:26.840 --> 1:44:27.840]  Yeah.
[1:44:27.840 --> 1:44:29.840]  I'm hesitant to it.
[1:44:29.840 --> 1:44:32.840]  But he also suggested, though, that he'd spoken
[1:44:32.840 --> 1:44:34.840]  to people who backed that up.
[1:44:34.840 --> 1:44:35.840]  8.2, I'm trying to believe.
[1:44:35.840 --> 1:44:36.840]  He's great.
[1:44:36.840 --> 1:44:40.840]  He's got good sourcing a lot of the time.
[1:44:40.840 --> 1:44:46.840]  I'm hesitant to, you know, to describe anything to version
[1:44:46.840 --> 1:44:47.840]  numbers.
[1:44:47.840 --> 1:44:51.840]  Like, you know, the six plus, I believe,
[1:44:51.840 --> 1:44:54.840]  I found seven comma two.
[1:44:54.840 --> 1:44:55.840]  Yeah.
[1:44:55.840 --> 1:44:57.840]  Six is seven comma one.
[1:44:57.840 --> 1:44:58.840]  It does not matter.
[1:44:58.840 --> 1:45:01.840]  Those things don't get assigned until way later than process.
[1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:02.840]  No.
[1:45:02.840 --> 1:45:04.840]  And the code names were weird too.
[1:45:04.840 --> 1:45:07.840]  The plus was N56.
[1:45:07.840 --> 1:45:08.840]  I've heard that.
[1:45:08.840 --> 1:45:09.840]  Six.
[1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:10.840]  The six was N61.
[1:45:10.840 --> 1:45:11.840]  I hadn't heard so.
[1:45:11.840 --> 1:45:13.840]  But they're arbitrary.
[1:45:13.840 --> 1:45:16.840]  I think we've both been told that they're.
[1:45:16.840 --> 1:45:17.840]  Yeah.
[1:45:17.840 --> 1:45:18.840]  They still make any sense.
[1:45:18.840 --> 1:45:19.840]  Yeah.
[1:45:19.840 --> 1:45:21.840]  Yeah.
[1:45:21.840 --> 1:45:24.840]  Like, for example, the fact that the six is N61
[1:45:24.840 --> 1:45:29.840]  and the plus is N56 doesn't mean that the six came after.
[1:45:29.840 --> 1:45:30.840]  There's no right.
[1:45:30.840 --> 1:45:33.840]  And it doesn't mean that there were four iterations between it.
[1:45:33.840 --> 1:45:35.840]  There's no reason to end this stuff.
[1:45:35.840 --> 1:45:37.840]  It is apparently just a, you know,
[1:45:37.840 --> 1:45:39.840]  there's an open slot at N56 here.
[1:45:39.840 --> 1:45:40.840]  Take it.
[1:45:40.840 --> 1:45:42.840]  You call it your device, the N56.
[1:45:42.840 --> 1:45:44.840]  Right.
[1:45:44.840 --> 1:45:46.840]  But people inside Apple get you really used to calling them
[1:45:46.840 --> 1:45:49.840]  by those, those names.
[1:45:49.840 --> 1:45:50.840]  Well, yeah.
[1:45:50.840 --> 1:45:51.840]  I mean, why would you?
[1:45:51.840 --> 1:45:52.840]  That's right.
[1:45:52.840 --> 1:45:53.840]  But there's, but there's no right.
[1:45:53.840 --> 1:45:54.840]  There's no right.
[1:45:54.840 --> 1:45:55.840]  I'm a reason.
[1:45:55.840 --> 1:45:56.840]  Right.
[1:45:56.840 --> 1:45:57.840]  Right.
[1:45:57.840 --> 1:46:00.840]  And the easiest thing to fake or fudge or whatever in the world
[1:46:00.840 --> 1:46:03.840]  is the user agent string of a browser.
[1:46:03.840 --> 1:46:08.840]  I know Don has two stories about that.
[1:46:08.840 --> 1:46:09.840]  All right.
[1:46:09.840 --> 1:46:11.840]  Let me take a third break here, but I will wrap up the show.
[1:46:11.840 --> 1:46:15.840]  But I want to thank our third.
[1:46:15.840 --> 1:46:18.840]  Third and final sponsor of this episode.
[1:46:18.840 --> 1:46:21.840]  Right back week after week from last week,
[1:46:21.840 --> 1:46:23.840]  it's you bar.
[1:46:23.840 --> 1:46:24.840]  It's a Mac utility.
[1:46:24.840 --> 1:46:27.840]  It's a doc replacement for the Mac.
[1:46:27.840 --> 1:46:30.840]  And it can be configured in a bunch of ways.
[1:46:30.840 --> 1:46:34.840]  You can configure as a replacement for the Mac OS doc
[1:46:34.840 --> 1:46:36.840]  that sort of same style.
[1:46:36.840 --> 1:46:39.840]  Or if you're a Windows convert to the Mac
[1:46:39.840 --> 1:46:43.840]  or just a Mac user who likes the Windows style taskbar,
[1:46:43.840 --> 1:46:47.840]  you bar has a configuration options that you can set it up
[1:46:47.840 --> 1:46:50.840]  to be a lot more taskbar like than Doc like.
[1:46:50.840 --> 1:46:54.840]  So if you refer for a doc, you can configure it that way.
[1:46:54.840 --> 1:46:57.840]  If it's a taskbar, you can do it that way.
[1:46:57.840 --> 1:46:59.840]  But no matter how you can figure it looks great.
[1:46:59.840 --> 1:47:00.840]  It's pure OS 10.
[1:47:00.840 --> 1:47:02.840]  It's just a Mac utility.
[1:47:02.840 --> 1:47:04.840]  It's all written really native.
[1:47:04.840 --> 1:47:07.840]  The developer, I still, I've mentioned this last week,
[1:47:07.840 --> 1:47:08.840]  but it's so fascinating to me.
[1:47:08.840 --> 1:47:13.840]  And one of his hobbies is mechanical watchmaking.
[1:47:13.840 --> 1:47:15.840]  And it really shows.
[1:47:15.840 --> 1:47:18.840]  And really, really nice handmade mechanical watches
[1:47:18.840 --> 1:47:21.840]  with just everything you'd think really fine attention
[1:47:21.840 --> 1:47:24.840]  to the typography on the dials and the shape
[1:47:24.840 --> 1:47:27.840]  and the exact length of the hands and everything like that.
[1:47:27.840 --> 1:47:32.840]  You bar looks like software from someone who makes precision
[1:47:32.840 --> 1:47:35.840]  watches, really does to me.
[1:47:35.840 --> 1:47:37.840]  But it's got a bunch of added features,
[1:47:37.840 --> 1:47:40.840]  nerdy features, sort of stuff that if you listen to the talk
[1:47:40.840 --> 1:47:41.840]  show, you might be interested in.
[1:47:41.840 --> 1:47:45.840]  So it also adds the features of activity monitor
[1:47:45.840 --> 1:47:48.840]  right into your taskbar, your doc.
[1:47:48.840 --> 1:47:51.840]  So if you hold the control key on your keyboard
[1:47:51.840 --> 1:47:53.840]  while you scrub across apps in the doc,
[1:47:53.840 --> 1:47:57.840]  it replaces the CPU name or the app name
[1:47:57.840 --> 1:48:02.840]  with the CPU and RAM usage for each process running in your doc.
[1:48:02.840 --> 1:48:05.840]  You can spot unresponsive apps immediately,
[1:48:05.840 --> 1:48:08.840]  an app that's doing the spinning piece of death,
[1:48:08.840 --> 1:48:12.840]  gets a flag right in the right in the doc right away.
[1:48:12.840 --> 1:48:16.840]  Tons of customization, light and dark themes
[1:48:16.840 --> 1:48:18.840]  just like in Yosemite.
[1:48:18.840 --> 1:48:20.840]  You can add favorites for quick access
[1:48:20.840 --> 1:48:23.840]  or have it just show the apps that are running.
[1:48:23.840 --> 1:48:25.840]  And the developer, he's working like mad.
[1:48:25.840 --> 1:48:28.840]  He's really just focused on this.
[1:48:28.840 --> 1:48:30.840]  You bar 2.0 launched in July,
[1:48:30.840 --> 1:48:33.840]  and there's already been 30 updates.
[1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:36.840]  And they sponsored the show last episode,
[1:48:36.840 --> 1:48:38.840]  and he emailed me and said the response from listeners
[1:48:38.840 --> 1:48:40.840]  has been phenomenal.
[1:48:40.840 --> 1:48:43.840]  A bunch of listeners' suggestions have already been implemented
[1:48:43.840 --> 1:48:46.840]  in Ubar through updates just since last week.
[1:48:46.840 --> 1:48:50.840]  And he's been blown away by how smart and enthusiastic.
[1:48:50.840 --> 1:48:54.840]  And I'll let's add how good looking the audience
[1:48:54.840 --> 1:48:57.840]  have listened to this show is.
[1:48:57.840 --> 1:49:00.840]  He's already had, he had the Apple Store business specialist,
[1:49:00.840 --> 1:49:03.840]  emailed him because customers started asking about Ubar
[1:49:03.840 --> 1:49:05.840]  after he was on the show last week.
[1:49:05.840 --> 1:49:06.840]  That's great.
[1:49:06.840 --> 1:49:08.840]  And a Japanese user spent sending him an email
[1:49:08.840 --> 1:49:11.840]  saying that a typhoon was on its way to Japan,
[1:49:11.840 --> 1:49:13.840]  which gave him free time because he didn't have to go to work.
[1:49:13.840 --> 1:49:16.840]  And so he sent over a full Japanese translation
[1:49:16.840 --> 1:49:18.840]  of the user interface.
[1:49:18.840 --> 1:49:23.840]  So J.I.Ubar is now just since the last episode of the talk show,
[1:49:23.840 --> 1:49:26.840]  it is now localized in Japanese due to a typhoon.
[1:49:26.840 --> 1:49:28.840]  So hopefully everybody's okay from the typhoon.
[1:49:28.840 --> 1:49:31.840]  That typhoon was a good news.
[1:49:31.840 --> 1:49:33.840]  Really, really, really interesting software.
[1:49:33.840 --> 1:49:35.840]  I had not heard of this utility before.
[1:49:35.840 --> 1:49:37.840]  And it's really, really interesting.
[1:49:37.840 --> 1:49:38.840]  It's certainly not for everybody.
[1:49:38.840 --> 1:49:41.840]  That's the whole point of things like dock replacements
[1:49:41.840 --> 1:49:47.840]  and launch bar and Alfred and apps like that.
[1:49:47.840 --> 1:49:49.840]  That sort of thing is not for everybody, right?
[1:49:49.840 --> 1:49:52.840]  Alfred and launch bar are not supposed to replace spotlight
[1:49:52.840 --> 1:49:53.840]  for everybody.
[1:49:53.840 --> 1:49:55.840]  Spotlight's the interface.
[1:49:55.840 --> 1:49:58.840]  That's for like hundreds of millions of people.
[1:49:58.840 --> 1:50:02.840]  Things like Ubar is, you know, for geeks who want to customize stuff.
[1:50:02.840 --> 1:50:03.840]  Really, really interesting.
[1:50:03.840 --> 1:50:05.840]  Normally the app is 20 bucks,
[1:50:05.840 --> 1:50:07.840]  which is a steal for software like this.
[1:50:07.840 --> 1:50:10.840]  But here's the pass or the coupon code.
[1:50:10.840 --> 1:50:12.840]  Gruber edition, all one word.
[1:50:12.840 --> 1:50:14.840]  It's like the watch.
[1:50:14.840 --> 1:50:16.840]  Gruber edition.
[1:50:16.840 --> 1:50:21.840]  And you get 50% off, meaning it's just 10 bucks.
[1:50:21.840 --> 1:50:26.840]  50% off, 10 bucks for an amazing app
[1:50:26.840 --> 1:50:29.840]  from a developer who's clearly very, very responsive to requests.
[1:50:29.840 --> 1:50:31.840]  So I wouldn't be surprised if you looked at it
[1:50:31.840 --> 1:50:33.840]  and thought, well, if it just did one more thing,
[1:50:33.840 --> 1:50:35.840]  maybe I would send this suggestion in.
[1:50:35.840 --> 1:50:37.840]  Here's where you go to find out more.
[1:50:37.840 --> 1:50:40.840]  Ubar, U-B-A-R, app.com.
[1:50:40.840 --> 1:50:43.840]  Ubar, app.com.
[1:50:43.840 --> 1:50:48.840]  And the coupon code, all one word, Gruber edition.
[1:50:48.840 --> 1:50:51.840]  Nice, like gold.
[1:50:51.840 --> 1:50:54.840]  You're pure gold, Gruber.
[1:50:54.840 --> 1:50:56.840]  It's been like eight days since the episode came out,
[1:50:56.840 --> 1:50:58.840]  but that's a lot to happen in a week.
[1:50:58.840 --> 1:51:00.840]  Yeah, that seems awesome.
[1:51:00.840 --> 1:51:02.840]  That's great.
[1:51:02.840 --> 1:51:06.840]  And, you know, it's not even like a Sherlock game,
[1:51:06.840 --> 1:51:08.840]  because he's, you know,
[1:51:08.840 --> 1:51:10.840]  like these kinds of things have been,
[1:51:10.840 --> 1:51:11.840]  yeah, it's reverse Sherlock game.
[1:51:11.840 --> 1:51:16.840]  Like this is, this is destined and intended for aces.
[1:51:16.840 --> 1:51:19.840]  Like, if you, are you a Mac Ace?
[1:51:19.840 --> 1:51:20.840]  Go get this.
[1:51:20.840 --> 1:51:21.840]  Right.
[1:51:21.840 --> 1:51:24.840]  Yeah, it's like, you know, B-B edit is,
[1:51:24.840 --> 1:51:26.840]  it was not Sherlock when they included text edit.
[1:51:26.840 --> 1:51:27.840]  Text edit.
[1:51:27.840 --> 1:51:28.840]  Just, you know.
[1:51:28.840 --> 1:51:29.840]  Right.
[1:51:29.840 --> 1:51:31.840]  It's like, if you need it, you know you need it.
[1:51:31.840 --> 1:51:35.840]  Whereas Apple is focusing on the, you know, across the board.
[1:51:35.840 --> 1:51:37.840]  Like, that's the way you survive when Apple has a built-in app
[1:51:37.840 --> 1:51:39.840]  that does the thing that you do.
[1:51:39.840 --> 1:51:40.840]  Yeah.
[1:51:40.840 --> 1:51:43.840]  Busy Cal, Busy Cal gets by by doing more and better
[1:51:43.840 --> 1:51:45.840]  than the built-in calendar app.
[1:51:45.840 --> 1:51:46.840]  Yeah.
[1:51:46.840 --> 1:51:47.840]  Yeah.
[1:51:47.840 --> 1:51:49.840]  I mean, you ship a notes app.
[1:51:49.840 --> 1:51:50.840]  Right.
[1:51:50.840 --> 1:51:51.840]  And you move into the Mac.
[1:51:51.840 --> 1:51:53.840]  So, you know.
[1:51:53.840 --> 1:51:54.840]  Right.
[1:51:54.840 --> 1:51:56.840]  You gotta, you gotta, you gotta say we can do better.
[1:51:56.840 --> 1:51:57.840]  Right.
[1:51:57.840 --> 1:51:59.840]  And you have to look at it and say Apple is always going to do
[1:51:59.840 --> 1:52:02.840]  something that's sort of very, very basic for the built-in thing.
[1:52:02.840 --> 1:52:03.840]  Yeah.
[1:52:03.840 --> 1:52:05.840]  No, I totally agree.
[1:52:05.840 --> 1:52:08.840]  Where were we?
[1:52:08.840 --> 1:52:10.840]  You tell me.
[1:52:10.840 --> 1:52:12.840]  I don't know.
[1:52:12.840 --> 1:52:16.840]  I think we were talking about, we were wrapping up, I think,
[1:52:16.840 --> 1:52:18.840]  the discussion on the annual cycle.
[1:52:18.840 --> 1:52:20.840]  Is that fair is that right?
[1:52:20.840 --> 1:52:23.840]  Yeah.
[1:52:23.840 --> 1:52:26.840]  Like, where do we think that they should go from here?
[1:52:26.840 --> 1:52:27.840]  And how about that?
[1:52:27.840 --> 1:52:28.840]  Do less.
[1:52:28.840 --> 1:52:29.840]  And you know what?
[1:52:29.840 --> 1:52:36.840]  Honestly, I think that at this point the, I think one of the
[1:52:36.840 --> 1:52:39.840]  problems is they've committed themselves to doing a major
[1:52:39.840 --> 1:52:41.840]  revision every year.
[1:52:41.840 --> 1:52:48.840]  And that is, and as much as I live marketing at Apple, like,
[1:52:48.840 --> 1:52:52.840]  don't, don't correctly.
[1:52:52.840 --> 1:52:57.840]  I don't think that you can commit yourself to doing as many
[1:52:57.840 --> 1:53:02.840]  new features per year as they have been committing themselves
[1:53:02.840 --> 1:53:03.840]  to do.
[1:53:03.840 --> 1:53:08.840]  And integrating a new class, all of the product lines from the Mac
[1:53:08.840 --> 1:53:14.840]  to iOS to the watch and eventually to the Apple TV stuff.
[1:53:14.840 --> 1:53:18.840]  Maybe that's a minor point, but it'll, you know, it'll
[1:53:18.840 --> 1:53:21.840]  eventually be a thing.
[1:53:21.840 --> 1:53:24.840]  I don't know what to do.
[1:53:24.840 --> 1:53:28.840]  I mean, maybe just get away from numbers at that point, right?
[1:53:28.840 --> 1:53:32.840]  Like, does it need to be iOS 9 next year?
[1:53:32.840 --> 1:53:35.840]  Or can it just be like, here's our latest iOS?
[1:53:35.840 --> 1:53:38.840]  Yeah, I don't know, though.
[1:53:38.840 --> 1:53:39.840]  I don't know either.
[1:53:39.840 --> 1:53:41.840]  I really don't know.
[1:53:41.840 --> 1:53:44.840]  But what's happening is untenable.
[1:53:44.840 --> 1:53:46.840]  I feel.
[1:53:46.840 --> 1:53:49.840]  I see the sense of that of getting rid of version numbers.
[1:53:49.840 --> 1:53:52.840]  But on the other hand, and it's like, I really don't know what
[1:53:52.840 --> 1:53:53.840]  version numbers mean to people out.
[1:53:53.840 --> 1:53:56.840]  Like, what does, what does my dad think when his iPad says that
[1:53:56.840 --> 1:53:58.840]  iOS 8.0 is available?
[1:53:58.840 --> 1:53:59.840]  Right.
[1:53:59.840 --> 1:54:02.840]  How much of that is gibberish and how much of it does you get
[1:54:02.840 --> 1:54:06.840]  the basic idea that they're just, you know, it's a new number?
[1:54:06.840 --> 1:54:07.840]  I don't know.
[1:54:07.840 --> 1:54:09.840]  I mean, he's never, you know.
[1:54:09.840 --> 1:54:10.840]  But I want to.
[1:54:10.840 --> 1:54:13.840]  But I do want, so that's a, that's a great point, but I do
[1:54:13.840 --> 1:54:17.840]  wonder if that internally, and because they're so involved
[1:54:17.840 --> 1:54:21.840]  in the industry and the, that particular way of looking at
[1:54:21.840 --> 1:54:26.840]  things, they say a new version number, meaning major new
[1:54:26.840 --> 1:54:28.840]  features.
[1:54:28.840 --> 1:54:31.840]  Maybe you don't need that, you know, like maybe
[1:54:31.840 --> 1:54:37.840]  you know that I, and I know this is a off beaten path, or
[1:54:37.840 --> 1:54:38.840]  what's the phrase?
[1:54:38.840 --> 1:54:39.840]  I don't know.
[1:54:39.840 --> 1:54:40.840]  Yeah.
[1:54:40.840 --> 1:54:42.840]  Horse that's been beaten a lot.
[1:54:42.840 --> 1:54:43.840]  Somebody's been beaten a lot.
[1:54:43.840 --> 1:54:44.840]  Being able.
[1:54:44.840 --> 1:54:45.840]  Yeah.
[1:54:45.840 --> 1:54:47.840]  Horse compared beaten a lot.
[1:54:47.840 --> 1:54:51.840]  But to compare the version, to compare software version numbers
[1:54:51.840 --> 1:54:54.840]  to the automobile industry.
[1:54:54.840 --> 1:54:58.840]  And nobody's confused when they say the new 2015 Honda Accord.
[1:54:58.840 --> 1:55:04.840]  But the 2016 Honda Accord may not be, it's only every four,
[1:55:04.840 --> 1:55:07.840]  three, four, five years that they actually do like a, wow,
[1:55:07.840 --> 1:55:08.840]  it's all together new.
[1:55:08.840 --> 1:55:09.840]  It's a new drivetrain.
[1:55:09.840 --> 1:55:13.840]  It's a new, you know, a new body shape, you know, and then
[1:55:13.840 --> 1:55:16.840]  between, you know, the years they're incremental.
[1:55:16.840 --> 1:55:17.840]  Right.
[1:55:17.840 --> 1:55:19.840]  But they don't label them differently.
[1:55:19.840 --> 1:55:23.840]  And they might advertise it more when there's a major new
[1:55:23.840 --> 1:55:24.840]  change, right?
[1:55:24.840 --> 1:55:27.840]  When they truly upgrade the body and it make it look a lot
[1:55:27.840 --> 1:55:30.840]  more modern and it's bigger and it has a major new technology
[1:55:30.840 --> 1:55:31.840]  and the engine.
[1:55:31.840 --> 1:55:34.840]  They might spend more on the ad campaign that year than they did
[1:55:34.840 --> 1:55:37.840]  the year before when it was an incremental version of the one
[1:55:37.840 --> 1:55:38.840]  before.
[1:55:38.840 --> 1:55:40.840]  But they still just give it a new year.
[1:55:40.840 --> 1:55:43.840]  And it just say it's the 2016 Honda Accord.
[1:55:43.840 --> 1:55:48.840]  And, you know, and that seems to work pretty well for them.
[1:55:48.840 --> 1:55:49.840]  I don't know.
[1:55:49.840 --> 1:55:51.840]  And I always thought that that was sort of what Microsoft
[1:55:51.840 --> 1:55:54.840]  was going for when they went from Windows 3, oh, to 3,
[1:55:54.840 --> 1:55:58.840]  1 to Windows 95 was the stop.
[1:55:58.840 --> 1:56:00.840]  Let's not bother people with.
[1:56:00.840 --> 1:56:02.840]  And then, you know, Windows 98.
[1:56:02.840 --> 1:56:04.840]  And then they, you know, I guess there was a Windows 2000,
[1:56:04.840 --> 1:56:07.840]  but then they were ran in a different direction with XP.
[1:56:07.840 --> 1:56:09.840]  Because I think maybe because they were.
[1:56:09.840 --> 1:56:13.840]  I think that was a good idea, but, you know, they would
[1:56:13.840 --> 1:56:15.840]  announce something and then ship a year later.
[1:56:15.840 --> 1:56:18.840]  And I think that bit them and they got cold feet.
[1:56:18.840 --> 1:56:19.840]  Yeah, that they were having it.
[1:56:19.840 --> 1:56:20.840]  They were, yeah.
[1:56:20.840 --> 1:56:22.840]  And it, they weren't doing it annually.
[1:56:22.840 --> 1:56:26.840]  And so you were still running Office 98 in the year 2001.
[1:56:26.840 --> 1:56:27.840]  And it felt old.
[1:56:27.840 --> 1:56:29.840]  Whereas if it had just been a version number,
[1:56:29.840 --> 1:56:30.840]  you might not think that.
[1:56:30.840 --> 1:56:32.840]  Whereas it really seemed like.
[1:56:32.840 --> 1:56:33.840]  And I don't know.
[1:56:33.840 --> 1:56:35.840]  Maybe there was something even that made it worse about
[1:56:35.840 --> 1:56:38.840]  crossing the millennium and still running, you know.
[1:56:38.840 --> 1:56:39.840]  Maybe.
[1:56:39.840 --> 1:56:41.840]  But I mean, I worked 11.
[1:56:41.840 --> 1:56:42.840]  Yeah.
[1:56:42.840 --> 1:56:43.840]  That was kind of awful.
[1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:46.840]  I think Apple kind of stepped in that exact same.
[1:56:46.840 --> 1:56:47.840]  Right.
[1:56:47.840 --> 1:56:48.840]  So Apple stepped in the same thing.
[1:56:48.840 --> 1:56:49.840]  Yeah.
[1:56:49.840 --> 1:56:53.840]  And the work 11 was up to date up until.
[1:56:53.840 --> 1:56:56.840]  And it's funny because some people still like it better.
[1:56:56.840 --> 1:56:57.840]  Yeah.
[1:56:57.840 --> 1:56:58.840]  So that's awkward.
[1:56:58.840 --> 1:57:02.840]  They had a bit of a Microsoft moment in a microcosm right there.
[1:57:02.840 --> 1:57:03.840]  Right.
[1:57:03.840 --> 1:57:05.840]  And it's just the case that, you know, even the companies
[1:57:05.840 --> 1:57:08.840]  that are functioning well, it's just so.
[1:57:08.840 --> 1:57:11.840]  Take so long to ship big software projects.
[1:57:11.840 --> 1:57:12.840]  Right.
[1:57:12.840 --> 1:57:14.840]  So yeah.
[1:57:14.840 --> 1:57:16.840]  I don't know if getting rid of version numbers would be the
[1:57:16.840 --> 1:57:17.840]  problem.
[1:57:17.840 --> 1:57:20.840]  It was doing less in each one and letting, you know, like as
[1:57:20.840 --> 1:57:24.840]  other couple people have called it, having a snow leopard moment.
[1:57:24.840 --> 1:57:25.840]  Yeah.
[1:57:25.840 --> 1:57:27.840]  And, you know, like Apple said with snow leopard.
[1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:28.840]  No new features.
[1:57:28.840 --> 1:57:29.840]  Right.
[1:57:29.840 --> 1:57:31.840]  No new features.
[1:57:31.840 --> 1:57:35.840]  What a great, what a great ball seed move to.
[1:57:35.840 --> 1:57:39.840]  I can't think of any other company in the industry ever,
[1:57:39.840 --> 1:57:41.840]  literally ever.
[1:57:41.840 --> 1:57:46.840]  That is had a big event saying we have nothing new.
[1:57:46.840 --> 1:57:49.840]  We're just going to, we're just going to spend this next, you know,
[1:57:49.840 --> 1:57:53.840]  a couple of months and, you know, we've spent the last few months
[1:57:53.840 --> 1:57:56.840]  and we're going to keep spending the next few months, you know,
[1:57:56.840 --> 1:57:57.840]  cleaning up the foundation.
[1:57:57.840 --> 1:57:58.840]  Yeah.
[1:57:58.840 --> 1:58:02.840]  Which, if we were honest, was effectively a misdirection because
[1:58:02.840 --> 1:58:06.840]  they had GCD, they had a bunch of API changes under the hood.
[1:58:06.840 --> 1:58:07.840]  Yeah.
[1:58:07.840 --> 1:58:08.840]  They had done a lot of work.
[1:58:08.840 --> 1:58:10.840]  But it was the user features, right?
[1:58:10.840 --> 1:58:11.840]  Yeah.
[1:58:11.840 --> 1:58:12.840]  It was really hard to market, right?
[1:58:12.840 --> 1:58:13.840]  GCD.
[1:58:13.840 --> 1:58:14.840]  Yeah.
[1:58:14.840 --> 1:58:16.840]  It was a perfect example where it was-
[1:58:16.840 --> 1:58:19.840]  I think that's from the killed garbage collection too in favor of Eric.
[1:58:19.840 --> 1:58:20.840]  Yeah.
[1:58:20.840 --> 1:58:21.840]  I think.
[1:58:21.840 --> 1:58:22.840]  So, yeah.
[1:58:22.840 --> 1:58:25.840]  And I think Syracuse appointed out perfectly in his review that,
[1:58:25.840 --> 1:58:28.840]  you know, no new features does not mean he had nothing to write
[1:58:28.840 --> 1:58:32.840]  about if anything he had as much to write about as ever before
[1:58:32.840 --> 1:58:35.840]  because he cares deeply about that sort of stuff.
[1:58:35.840 --> 1:58:40.840]  But from like, what do you tell normal people who are just coming in for a new
[1:58:40.840 --> 1:58:41.840]  MacBook?
[1:58:41.840 --> 1:58:43.840]  Well, what's new in snow leopard?
[1:58:43.840 --> 1:58:45.840]  Well, we've cleaned it up under hood and it runs more efficiently.
[1:58:45.840 --> 1:58:46.840]  Yeah.
[1:58:46.840 --> 1:58:46.840]  It's not-
[1:58:46.840 --> 1:58:47.840]  Yeah, it's true.
[1:58:47.840 --> 1:58:48.840]  It's better.
[1:58:48.840 --> 1:58:49.840]  Right.
[1:58:49.840 --> 1:58:50.840]  Like, better.
[1:58:50.840 --> 1:58:51.840]  Right.
[1:58:51.840 --> 1:58:52.840]  And I've seen it in conversation.
[1:58:52.840 --> 1:58:55.840]  But it's, you know, it was a fact that though that a lot of
[1:58:55.840 --> 1:58:59.840]  engineering resources had been committed to and devoted to things
[1:58:59.840 --> 1:59:03.840]  like GCD and ARK and stuff like that that wasn't user facing.
[1:59:03.840 --> 1:59:08.840]  And, you know, again, it's, in a sense, sometimes, or not even
[1:59:08.840 --> 1:59:12.840]  sometimes, almost always the best marketing is to be completely
[1:59:12.840 --> 1:59:13.840]  honest, you know?
[1:59:13.840 --> 1:59:16.840]  And even if it sounds like a funny thing for a tech company
[1:59:16.840 --> 1:59:19.840]  to say, no new features, I don't know.
[1:59:19.840 --> 1:59:21.840]  It went over well with everybody I know.
[1:59:21.840 --> 1:59:24.840]  And I think in hindsight it was a great release.
[1:59:24.840 --> 1:59:28.840]  I agree, but I do, you know, kind of everybody you know
[1:59:28.840 --> 1:59:32.840]  and everybody I know is that, you know, that's a bit of a small
[1:59:32.840 --> 1:59:33.840]  window, right?
[1:59:33.840 --> 1:59:37.840]  Yeah, but, you know, it is tech wise, right?
[1:59:37.840 --> 1:59:38.840]  Right.
[1:59:38.840 --> 1:59:41.840]  But think about the people you know.
[1:59:41.840 --> 1:59:44.840]  You know, like with Adri, like with you recommending that she
[1:59:44.840 --> 1:59:47.840]  not update, wouldn't you like to be able to tell her next year
[1:59:47.840 --> 1:59:48.840]  with iOS 9?
[1:59:48.840 --> 1:59:49.840]  Yeah, just go ahead and update.
[1:59:49.840 --> 1:59:51.840]  It's just going to make your phone runs faster.
[1:59:51.840 --> 1:59:54.840]  Like if you really believe that that was the case, don't you
[1:59:54.840 --> 1:59:56.840]  think that would go over well with her?
[1:59:56.840 --> 1:59:57.840]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[1:59:57.840 --> 2:00:00.840]  Like, you know, restoring a little bit of faith and stuff.
[2:00:00.840 --> 2:00:03.840]  I mean, I already told it like 802, whatever.
[2:00:03.840 --> 2:00:06.840]  Yeah, 802.
[2:00:06.840 --> 2:00:07.840]  Do it.
[2:00:07.840 --> 2:00:08.840]  Covered.
[2:00:08.840 --> 2:00:10.840]  It's going to be good.
[2:00:10.840 --> 2:00:13.840]  I think there's still like a little bit of trepidation, but yeah,
[2:00:13.840 --> 2:00:15.840]  like next year, I just want to get a little bit of fun.
[2:00:15.840 --> 2:00:17.840]  I get crap from Amy.
[2:00:17.840 --> 2:00:18.840]  I do.
[2:00:18.840 --> 2:00:22.840]  Like, I think like a lot of people like she had iTunes match
[2:00:22.840 --> 2:00:25.840]  turned on and she updated.
[2:00:25.840 --> 2:00:28.840]  She got a new phone and she updated or she had to update because
[2:00:28.840 --> 2:00:29.840]  she got a new phone.
[2:00:29.840 --> 2:00:32.840]  I said all of her music was there and then she went to the gym
[2:00:32.840 --> 2:00:34.840]  and there was like no music on her phone.
[2:00:34.840 --> 2:00:37.840]  And I was like, that's welcome to iTunes match.
[2:00:37.840 --> 2:00:41.840]  And she blamed me because she just, you know, she knows that I
[2:00:41.840 --> 2:00:42.840]  don't work at Apple.
[2:00:42.840 --> 2:00:45.840]  And I certainly, you know, I did nothing to do with iTunes match,
[2:00:45.840 --> 2:00:49.840]  but she blames me that the cloud is just unreliable.
[2:00:49.840 --> 2:00:52.840]  And I said, I tell you, I think that what I did is I turned
[2:00:52.840 --> 2:00:54.840]  off iTunes match and I have all the music I want.
[2:00:54.840 --> 2:00:57.840]  It's on my computer and I just sync to iTunes the old
[2:00:57.840 --> 2:00:58.840]  fashion way.
[2:00:58.840 --> 2:00:59.840]  So I say, here, give me your phone.
[2:00:59.840 --> 2:01:01.840]  Turned off iTunes match, plugged it into her Mac,
[2:01:01.840 --> 2:01:04.840]  and did a sync and said, put all of her music on it.
[2:01:04.840 --> 2:01:06.840]  And now all of her music is there.
[2:01:06.840 --> 2:01:08.840]  And she's never going to complain again.
[2:01:08.840 --> 2:01:10.840]  But I would love to have been able to say to her,
[2:01:10.840 --> 2:01:13.840]  yeah, just upgrade to iOS 8 and it fixes all the iTunes
[2:01:13.840 --> 2:01:15.840]  match issues.
[2:01:15.840 --> 2:01:16.840]  Yeah, that makes sense to me.
[2:01:16.840 --> 2:01:20.840]  I haven't actually ever used iTunes match.
[2:01:20.840 --> 2:01:23.840]  But there's a lot of little things with the cloud stuff that
[2:01:23.840 --> 2:01:24.840]  works like that.
[2:01:24.840 --> 2:01:26.840]  Well, yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[2:01:26.840 --> 2:01:29.840]  Like, I used to really worry about backing up my iTunes library
[2:01:29.840 --> 2:01:30.840]  because I bought that.
[2:01:30.840 --> 2:01:35.840]  And if my heart rate died, I'd be screwed.
[2:01:35.840 --> 2:01:38.840]  But that's mostly no longer the case, right?
[2:01:38.840 --> 2:01:39.840]  Yeah.
[2:01:39.840 --> 2:01:40.840]  Like, man.
[2:01:40.840 --> 2:01:41.840]  I don't care anymore.
[2:01:41.840 --> 2:01:44.840]  I buy a new device and I've got all of it.
[2:01:44.840 --> 2:01:48.840]  At least it lists everything that I've ever bought and I can watch.
[2:01:48.840 --> 2:01:54.840]  And I can buy my new phone and I can watch a casino royale on it
[2:01:54.840 --> 2:01:59.840]  because I bought it years ago.
[2:01:59.840 --> 2:02:02.840]  So I don't really care about that kind of stuff that much
[2:02:02.840 --> 2:02:05.840]  anymore.
[2:02:05.840 --> 2:02:07.840]  Well, I think music, not to go on a total iTunes attention,
[2:02:07.840 --> 2:02:09.840]  but I think music is very different from movies
[2:02:09.840 --> 2:02:13.840]  because with movies, if you're, you know,
[2:02:13.840 --> 2:02:17.840]  you don't necessarily, there's no good reason to have all of your
[2:02:17.840 --> 2:02:20.840]  movies with you all the time on your local device.
[2:02:20.840 --> 2:02:21.840]  No, no, no.
[2:02:21.840 --> 2:02:24.840]  The only time I worry about it is if I'm going to go in a flight.
[2:02:24.840 --> 2:02:25.840]  Yeah.
[2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:26.840]  Something, yeah.
[2:02:26.840 --> 2:02:28.840]  And even then, you're probably only going to load a handful of
[2:02:28.840 --> 2:02:31.840]  them and you can stand to just sit there and wait.
[2:02:31.840 --> 2:02:35.840]  If you're, you know, want to listen to music for the next 90 minutes
[2:02:35.840 --> 2:02:37.840]  and you don't have any of it on your device.
[2:02:37.840 --> 2:02:40.840]  It, you know, it's a pain in the ass if you have to sit there
[2:02:40.840 --> 2:02:43.840]  and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait.
[2:02:43.840 --> 2:02:45.840]  Yeah, music's a little different.
[2:02:45.840 --> 2:02:47.840]  And for the most part, the stuff does still just work
[2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:49.840]  where you get a new device and sign any.
[2:02:49.840 --> 2:02:52.840]  Even if you don't restore from a backup and you just sign into
[2:02:52.840 --> 2:02:54.840]  your iCloud account and you say,
[2:02:54.840 --> 2:02:56.840]  what was that book that I book I bought?
[2:02:56.840 --> 2:02:57.840]  And I wanted to look it back up.
[2:02:57.840 --> 2:02:58.840]  There it is.
[2:02:58.840 --> 2:02:59.840]  And you hit the cloud button and just comes down.
[2:02:59.840 --> 2:03:00.840]  But it doesn't always work.
[2:03:00.840 --> 2:03:04.840]  Sometimes it just, you know, the download gets stuck.
[2:03:04.840 --> 2:03:10.840]  So, what's your take on this yearly update thing?
[2:03:10.840 --> 2:03:16.840]  Uh, you know, John Gribburn, 2003.
[2:03:16.840 --> 2:03:19.840]  It seemed to think it was a great idea.
[2:03:19.840 --> 2:03:21.840]  I think what would you be your,
[2:03:21.840 --> 2:03:23.840]  like, how would you frame this discussion now?
[2:03:23.840 --> 2:03:25.840]  You know, if you had to read about this piece,
[2:03:25.840 --> 2:03:26.840]  well, not the whole piece.
[2:03:26.840 --> 2:03:27.840]  I wouldn't.
[2:03:27.840 --> 2:03:30.840]  And I think that they, I think that they should go,
[2:03:30.840 --> 2:03:34.840]  they're, I think the annual pace is probably fine.
[2:03:34.840 --> 2:03:37.840]  And actually probably helps keep them in check.
[2:03:37.840 --> 2:03:40.840]  But I think that they should consider doing less per year
[2:03:40.840 --> 2:03:43.840]  and polishing more.
[2:03:43.840 --> 2:03:50.840]  And if they can figure out a way to let some ideas operate,
[2:03:50.840 --> 2:03:53.840]  you know, well, if you get it done, then you're in,
[2:03:53.840 --> 2:03:56.840]  but if you don't, but then maybe not advertising them at
[2:03:56.840 --> 2:03:58.840]  promising less at WWDC.
[2:03:58.840 --> 2:04:01.840]  And maybe slating some of those things
[2:04:01.840 --> 2:04:08.840]  for a 9.2 update in March of 2016.
[2:04:08.840 --> 2:04:10.840]  That does make it hard for developers,
[2:04:10.840 --> 2:04:12.840]  and it makes it hard for customers.
[2:04:12.840 --> 2:04:14.840]  Well, more importantly, from Apple's perspective,
[2:04:14.840 --> 2:04:15.840]  customer, right?
[2:04:15.840 --> 2:04:19.840]  Like, you need to, I think the reason that they stick to
[2:04:19.840 --> 2:04:25.840]  hard version numbers is that that is the gate for functionality.
[2:04:25.840 --> 2:04:29.840]  And it is, and so many other things are annual at Apple.
[2:04:29.840 --> 2:04:31.840]  The phones come out on an annual basis.
[2:04:31.840 --> 2:04:34.840]  And for competitive reasons, they really do need to.
[2:04:34.840 --> 2:04:36.840]  Because their competitors come out with a new,
[2:04:36.840 --> 2:04:39.840]  Apple only come out with one set of new phones every year
[2:04:39.840 --> 2:04:42.840]  is slow compared to everybody else in the industry.
[2:04:42.840 --> 2:04:44.840]  Oh, yeah.
[2:04:44.840 --> 2:04:49.840]  And it, I would say clasial, but it's delivered in an industry
[2:04:49.840 --> 2:04:52.840]  where there's not much deliberation where it's sort of,
[2:04:52.840 --> 2:04:54.840]  soon, you know, if you can ship it,
[2:04:54.840 --> 2:04:56.840]  let's ship it and see if people will buy it.
[2:04:56.840 --> 2:04:59.840]  But Apple is very deliberative, and they have to be,
[2:04:59.840 --> 2:05:01.840]  but then they run into things where if they're going to sell
[2:05:01.840 --> 2:05:03.840]  100 million of the same thing a year,
[2:05:03.840 --> 2:05:06.840]  they need to be able to have 100 million of every single component.
[2:05:06.840 --> 2:05:11.840]  You know, they need to have 100 million A8 systems on a chip,
[2:05:11.840 --> 2:05:15.840]  and 100 million of the new HD retina displays
[2:05:15.840 --> 2:05:18.840]  in two different sizes, et cetera, et cetera,
[2:05:18.840 --> 2:05:20.840]  every single thing in the box.
[2:05:20.840 --> 2:05:23.840]  But the hardware runs on, doesn't run on a yearly cycle, though.
[2:05:23.840 --> 2:05:25.840]  That's the thing, they come out with one every year,
[2:05:25.840 --> 2:05:28.840]  but they're in the works for longer than a year,
[2:05:28.840 --> 2:05:32.840]  a lot longer than a year, which is why it's taken them a little bit
[2:05:32.840 --> 2:05:35.840]  too longer than the market would dictate to come out with bigger phones,
[2:05:35.840 --> 2:05:39.840]  because it's, you know, if it takes two years to make a new iPhone,
[2:05:39.840 --> 2:05:43.840]  they didn't get to commit to these phones until about two years ago.
[2:05:43.840 --> 2:05:45.840]  Like the iPhone 7, or whatever you want to call that,
[2:05:45.840 --> 2:05:47.840]  two years maybe a big window.
[2:05:47.840 --> 2:05:49.840]  Yeah, but it's more than a year.
[2:05:49.840 --> 2:05:50.840]  Oh, yeah.
[2:05:50.840 --> 2:05:52.840]  So maybe it's not quite two years, maybe it's more like a year.
[2:05:52.840 --> 2:05:54.840]  It's in there for something.
[2:05:54.840 --> 2:05:57.840]  But the team that's doing next year's iPhones
[2:05:57.840 --> 2:06:00.840]  is already, you know, long, you know, they've been at work
[2:06:00.840 --> 2:06:01.840]  for six, seven, eight months.
[2:06:01.840 --> 2:06:03.840]  The specs are already out there.
[2:06:03.840 --> 2:06:07.840]  I mean, I'm sure you know, but just to listen to that there,
[2:06:07.840 --> 2:06:09.840]  it's kind of funny when you talk to people who work at Apple
[2:06:09.840 --> 2:06:12.840]  because they have no idea what happened and want to lose.
[2:06:12.840 --> 2:06:13.840]  No.
[2:06:13.840 --> 2:06:15.840]  Actually, they're like, oh, is that an out one?
[2:06:15.840 --> 2:06:17.840]  I don't know.
[2:06:17.840 --> 2:06:20.840]  It blurs together more for them than for us.
[2:06:20.840 --> 2:06:24.840]  It's like, I was done with that six months a year before.
[2:06:24.840 --> 2:06:25.840]  Yeah.
[2:06:25.840 --> 2:06:26.840]  You ever saw it.
[2:06:26.840 --> 2:06:27.840]  Right.
[2:06:27.840 --> 2:06:28.840]  Yeah.
[2:06:28.840 --> 2:06:30.840]  And they don't, they don't even know what it's going to be called.
[2:06:30.840 --> 2:06:31.840]  They have no idea.
[2:06:31.840 --> 2:06:32.840]  They honestly don't.
[2:06:32.840 --> 2:06:33.840]  Yeah.
[2:06:33.840 --> 2:06:33.840]  No.
[2:06:33.840 --> 2:06:36.840]  And so that really is what confuses it for them historically,
[2:06:36.840 --> 2:06:38.840]  is that while they were working on stuff,
[2:06:38.840 --> 2:06:39.840]  they don't know what it was going to be called.
[2:06:39.840 --> 2:06:43.840]  And so in hindsight, when they look back like two, three years,
[2:06:43.840 --> 2:06:45.840]  they don't, they just know it was something.
[2:06:45.840 --> 2:06:48.840]  They really can't remember what products something shipped in.
[2:06:48.840 --> 2:06:49.840]  They have no idea.
[2:06:49.840 --> 2:06:50.840]  No.
[2:06:50.840 --> 2:06:51.840]  You have to remind them.
[2:06:51.840 --> 2:06:52.840]  And they're like, oh, really?
[2:06:52.840 --> 2:06:53.840]  That's interesting.
[2:06:53.840 --> 2:06:54.840]  Yeah.
[2:06:54.840 --> 2:06:57.840]  So no, I don't think the annual schedule is off,
[2:06:57.840 --> 2:07:00.840]  but I think that they need to paste themselves better.
[2:07:00.840 --> 2:07:01.840]  I don't know.
[2:07:01.840 --> 2:07:02.840]  But again, like I said,
[2:07:02.840 --> 2:07:04.840]  maybe the optimistic take is that iOS 8,
[2:07:04.840 --> 2:07:06.840]  because it introduced all this.
[2:07:06.840 --> 2:07:09.840]  You think this was an aggressive release followed,
[2:07:09.840 --> 2:07:13.840]  preceded by another aggressive release?
[2:07:13.840 --> 2:07:14.840]  Yeah.
[2:07:14.840 --> 2:07:15.840]  Yeah.
[2:07:15.840 --> 2:07:16.840]  Maybe.
[2:07:16.840 --> 2:07:17.840]  That'd be great.
[2:07:17.840 --> 2:07:18.840]  Yeah.
[2:07:18.840 --> 2:07:19.840]  Yeah.
[2:07:19.840 --> 2:07:22.840]  I think it'll be interesting to see how Yosemite comes out.
[2:07:22.840 --> 2:07:25.840]  I've been running the GM.
[2:07:25.840 --> 2:07:26.840]  Yeah.
[2:07:26.840 --> 2:07:27.840]  Same here.
[2:07:27.840 --> 2:07:28.840]  I think it's pretty good.
[2:07:28.840 --> 2:07:29.840]  But I don't know why.
[2:07:29.840 --> 2:07:30.840]  I like it.
[2:07:30.840 --> 2:07:32.840]  I have some weird aesthetic choices about it.
[2:07:32.840 --> 2:07:33.840]  But yeah.
[2:07:33.840 --> 2:07:35.840]  But in terms of like quality,
[2:07:35.840 --> 2:07:37.840]  I don't think it's going to be a problem like iOS 8.
[2:07:37.840 --> 2:07:38.840]  No.
[2:07:38.840 --> 2:07:39.840]  Famous last words.
[2:07:39.840 --> 2:07:40.840]  Yeah.
[2:07:40.840 --> 2:07:41.840]  Exactly.
[2:07:41.840 --> 2:07:42.840]  Famous last words, I guess.
[2:07:42.840 --> 2:07:43.840]  But I don't think so.
[2:07:43.840 --> 2:07:47.840]  I think because I think that the changes are mostly skin deep.
[2:07:47.840 --> 2:07:48.840]  Yeah.
[2:07:48.840 --> 2:07:49.840]  Yeah.
[2:07:49.840 --> 2:07:51.840]  And while I have some issues with it,
[2:07:51.840 --> 2:07:53.840]  I don't think you're going to be voting
[2:07:53.840 --> 2:07:58.840]  at the foremost, the last blur pieces, right?
[2:07:58.840 --> 2:07:59.840]  No.
[2:07:59.840 --> 2:08:00.840]  No.
[2:08:00.840 --> 2:08:01.840]  Like it's weird.
[2:08:01.840 --> 2:08:03.840]  But I don't think you need to, you know,
[2:08:03.840 --> 2:08:05.840]  take the knives out of that one.
[2:08:05.840 --> 2:08:06.840]  No.
[2:08:06.840 --> 2:08:09.840]  And I think it also passes the every time I go back to Mavericks now.
[2:08:09.840 --> 2:08:11.840]  I think it looks really outdated.
[2:08:11.840 --> 2:08:12.840]  Yeah.
[2:08:12.840 --> 2:08:13.840]  Yeah.
[2:08:13.840 --> 2:08:14.840]  Yeah.
[2:08:14.840 --> 2:08:16.840]  And the hilarious thing is that it brings me back
[2:08:16.840 --> 2:08:19.840]  to Windows Vista, which did the blur thing.
[2:08:19.840 --> 2:08:20.840]  Right.
[2:08:20.840 --> 2:08:21.840]  Years ago.
[2:08:21.840 --> 2:08:25.840]  And whoever did that, if you're listening and you find me,
[2:08:25.840 --> 2:08:29.840]  I will buy you lots of beers because.
[2:08:29.840 --> 2:08:30.840]  Who did this?
[2:08:30.840 --> 2:08:31.840]  Does this someone?
[2:08:31.840 --> 2:08:32.840]  Yeah.
[2:08:32.840 --> 2:08:33.840]  The Vista blur.
[2:08:33.840 --> 2:08:34.840]  That sucks for that guy.
[2:08:34.840 --> 2:08:36.840]  We all laughed at him.
[2:08:36.840 --> 2:08:39.840]  And now iOS and Mac OS are just totally like,
[2:08:39.840 --> 2:08:41.840]  yeah, let's blur everything.
[2:08:41.840 --> 2:08:42.840]  All of all of the time.
[2:08:42.840 --> 2:08:44.840]  Everything is blurry.
[2:08:44.840 --> 2:08:48.840]  And that guy is just at the, if he's not at the bottom of a glass,
[2:08:48.840 --> 2:08:50.840]  he should be.
[2:08:50.840 --> 2:08:51.840]  There is.
[2:08:51.840 --> 2:08:52.840]  I don't want to go too deep.
[2:08:52.840 --> 2:08:53.840]  We've already been to ours.
[2:08:53.840 --> 2:08:54.840]  We should wrap it up.
[2:08:54.840 --> 2:08:57.840]  And I want to wait till Yosemite actually ships before really getting.
[2:08:57.840 --> 2:08:58.840]  Yeah.
[2:08:58.840 --> 2:09:01.840]  But there is some weird stuff, though, where the way that Apple's
[2:09:01.840 --> 2:09:04.840]  doing it is making any fucking sense.
[2:09:04.840 --> 2:09:05.840]  Right.
[2:09:05.840 --> 2:09:06.840]  And I know you're going to agree with me.
[2:09:06.840 --> 2:09:09.840]  The main thing is that you have a translucent sidebar.
[2:09:09.840 --> 2:09:12.840]  The whole sidebar is translucent in whatever.
[2:09:12.840 --> 2:09:13.840]  Yeah.
[2:09:13.840 --> 2:09:17.840]  It lacks the color of your desktop, regardless of how many windows
[2:09:17.840 --> 2:09:20.840]  are in between the front window and the desktop.
[2:09:20.840 --> 2:09:22.840]  It's completely random.
[2:09:22.840 --> 2:09:23.840]  I don't know.
[2:09:23.840 --> 2:09:25.840]  I want to talk to you to this.
[2:09:25.840 --> 2:09:28.840]  So like, let's just say you have an orange desktop.
[2:09:28.840 --> 2:09:32.840]  I've got a machine here right now with the carpet from the shiny.
[2:09:32.840 --> 2:09:35.840]  But it only does it when the window is the front most window.
[2:09:35.840 --> 2:09:38.840]  Otherwise, it's completely opaque.
[2:09:38.840 --> 2:09:39.840]  Right.
[2:09:39.840 --> 2:09:43.840]  Anyway, yeah.
[2:09:43.840 --> 2:09:47.840]  People are going to hear my description.
[2:09:47.840 --> 2:09:49.840]  And then they're going to file it away.
[2:09:49.840 --> 2:09:51.840]  And I think I can't quite be like that.
[2:09:51.840 --> 2:09:54.840]  But then everybody's going to upgrade to Yosemite in a couple of weeks
[2:09:54.840 --> 2:09:55.840]  a week or two.
[2:09:55.840 --> 2:09:57.840]  And then they're going to, oh my god, Gruber was right.
[2:09:57.840 --> 2:10:00.840]  But it's like, so if you just just imagine, you have one window.
[2:10:00.840 --> 2:10:01.840]  Open.
[2:10:01.840 --> 2:10:03.840]  And that's how Apple, all their screenshots show,
[2:10:03.840 --> 2:10:05.840]  just one window at a time.
[2:10:05.840 --> 2:10:08.840]  This translucent part shows the colors of blurred.
[2:10:08.840 --> 2:10:11.840]  It shows the colors of your underlying desktop picture through.
[2:10:11.840 --> 2:10:13.840]  So if you have like an orange desktop pattern,
[2:10:13.840 --> 2:10:15.840]  it's orange blurry.
[2:10:15.840 --> 2:10:18.840]  But then if you have windows in between the front window
[2:10:18.840 --> 2:10:21.840]  and the desktop, and they're all white,
[2:10:21.840 --> 2:10:23.840]  like let's just say they're all text edit windows.
[2:10:23.840 --> 2:10:25.840]  But they're all stacked on top of each other.
[2:10:25.840 --> 2:10:27.840]  The sidebar is still orange.
[2:10:27.840 --> 2:10:32.840]  It's somehow, right.
[2:10:32.840 --> 2:10:35.840]  I can imagine the discussion that led to this,
[2:10:35.840 --> 2:10:38.840]  where I can imagine a discussion where the idea was started,
[2:10:38.840 --> 2:10:40.840]  or we'll make it, you know, we'll make it see through.
[2:10:40.840 --> 2:10:41.840]  We'll make it translucent.
[2:10:41.840 --> 2:10:44.840]  And it was all based on just like one window on the desktop.
[2:10:44.840 --> 2:10:47.840]  And then somebody was like, but what if you have windows in between
[2:10:47.840 --> 2:10:48.840]  in the back?
[2:10:48.840 --> 2:10:49.840]  I love that.
[2:10:49.840 --> 2:10:50.840]  That's the objection.
[2:10:50.840 --> 2:10:51.840]  Right.
[2:10:51.840 --> 2:10:53.840]  But what if there was more than one window?
[2:10:53.840 --> 2:10:54.840]  Right.
[2:10:54.840 --> 2:10:56.840]  And instead of saying where you should start, right?
[2:10:56.840 --> 2:10:57.840]  Right.
[2:10:57.840 --> 2:10:59.840]  They would just be like, well, then it would be, it'll just be gray.
[2:10:59.840 --> 2:11:02.840]  And then somebody was like, well, then that'll be dull.
[2:11:02.840 --> 2:11:04.840]  And it will lose that.
[2:11:04.840 --> 2:11:05.840]  What's that phrase I keep using?
[2:11:05.840 --> 2:11:08.840]  That it shows the character of your desktop, you know,
[2:11:08.840 --> 2:11:09.840]  in front of your window.
[2:11:09.840 --> 2:11:10.840]  Right.
[2:11:10.840 --> 2:11:13.840]  And then somebody, somebody said, well, it'll still show
[2:11:13.840 --> 2:11:16.840]  your desktop colors right through.
[2:11:16.840 --> 2:11:19.840]  And then that's what they made happen.
[2:11:19.840 --> 2:11:22.840]  I don't understand.
[2:11:22.840 --> 2:11:24.840]  There's no logic to it.
[2:11:24.840 --> 2:11:25.840]  Right.
[2:11:25.840 --> 2:11:26.840]  No.
[2:11:26.840 --> 2:11:28.840]  And maybe that's, you know,
[2:11:28.840 --> 2:11:30.840]  maybe that's annoying to people like you and I.
[2:11:30.840 --> 2:11:31.840]  Right.
[2:11:31.840 --> 2:11:34.840]  Because I want to see, I want it to work like somehow like
[2:11:34.840 --> 2:11:36.840]  well, I need to understand it visually and spatially.
[2:11:36.840 --> 2:11:37.840]  Right.
[2:11:37.840 --> 2:11:37.840]  Yeah.
[2:11:37.840 --> 2:11:38.840]  I want there to be rules.
[2:11:38.840 --> 2:11:40.840]  I want it to be like a game with it.
[2:11:40.840 --> 2:11:40.840]  Right.
[2:11:40.840 --> 2:11:41.840]  There's rules.
[2:11:41.840 --> 2:11:45.840]  And if this is see through, then it should show whatever is
[2:11:45.840 --> 2:11:46.840]  behind it.
[2:11:46.840 --> 2:11:47.840]  I totally agree with you.
[2:11:47.840 --> 2:11:50.840]  The rules are completely fucking arbitrary at this point.
[2:11:50.840 --> 2:11:51.840]  Right.
[2:11:51.840 --> 2:11:54.840]  Like now I'm looking at the programming.
[2:11:54.840 --> 2:11:59.840]  Like I, I, restrictions have been placed on this.
[2:11:59.840 --> 2:12:05.840]  But I, you know, I can't remember my head around.
[2:12:05.840 --> 2:12:09.840]  I can guess why the choices were made, but aesthetically,
[2:12:09.840 --> 2:12:11.840]  I can explain it.
[2:12:11.840 --> 2:12:12.840]  Yeah.
[2:12:12.840 --> 2:12:13.840]  I'm not sure.
[2:12:13.840 --> 2:12:14.840]  I also, I do feel too.
[2:12:14.840 --> 2:12:17.840]  I feel like I'll predict that the other backlash is going
[2:12:17.840 --> 2:12:24.840]  to be that Helvetica is a system font really is pretty choppy
[2:12:24.840 --> 2:12:27.840]  on non retina displays.
[2:12:27.840 --> 2:12:31.840]  And that it's, this is the, what you're seeing in Yosemite,
[2:12:31.840 --> 2:12:33.840]  I guess there's no name for it really.
[2:12:33.840 --> 2:12:35.840]  There's not like a name for the theme anymore.
[2:12:35.840 --> 2:12:38.840]  It's not like called anything, but the Yosemite, you know,
[2:12:38.840 --> 2:12:42.840]  look and feel the Chrome is, it's forward thinking to when
[2:12:42.840 --> 2:12:45.840]  all Macs are going to have retina quality displays.
[2:12:45.840 --> 2:12:46.840]  Which I think is reasonable.
[2:12:46.840 --> 2:12:49.840]  I mean, and I think you're trying to avoid like,
[2:12:49.840 --> 2:12:51.840]  awkward noise or something, right?
[2:12:51.840 --> 2:12:52.840]  Yeah.
[2:12:52.840 --> 2:12:54.840]  It's a, it's a different thing.
[2:12:54.840 --> 2:12:55.840]  Yeah.
[2:12:55.840 --> 2:12:56.840]  I think it's the right time.
[2:12:56.840 --> 2:12:58.840]  It's, you know, it's like you said with the whole compositing
[2:12:58.840 --> 2:13:01.840]  system in Mac OS 10, 10.0, right?
[2:13:01.840 --> 2:13:02.840]  Got to take your lumps, right?
[2:13:02.840 --> 2:13:03.840]  You got to take your lumps.
[2:13:03.840 --> 2:13:04.840]  Take your lumps.
[2:13:04.840 --> 2:13:06.840]  But then when the hardware catches up,
[2:13:06.840 --> 2:13:07.840]  we'll already be ready.
[2:13:07.840 --> 2:13:08.840]  Right.
[2:13:08.840 --> 2:13:11.840]  And, you know, I feel like the, I feel like the whole Yosemite
[2:13:11.840 --> 2:13:14.840]  look and feel is so clearly optimized for retina.
[2:13:14.840 --> 2:13:18.840]  And then made second hand to look as good as possible on
[2:13:18.840 --> 2:13:20.840]  non retina as opposed to the other way around.
[2:13:20.840 --> 2:13:24.840]  We're up until now the Mac interface has been non retina
[2:13:24.840 --> 2:13:27.840]  first, and then it just looks kind of weird on retina.
[2:13:27.840 --> 2:13:31.840]  Not that it looks low res, but that it just just are odd to see.
[2:13:31.840 --> 2:13:32.840]  Isn't quite suitable.
[2:13:32.840 --> 2:13:33.840]  Yeah.
[2:13:33.840 --> 2:13:34.840]  No, I totally agree.
[2:13:34.840 --> 2:13:35.840]  Right.
[2:13:35.840 --> 2:13:40.840]  And this is, I am sitting in front of a Mac Pro.
[2:13:40.840 --> 2:13:44.840]  More or less the most expensive computer you could play from Apple.
[2:13:44.840 --> 2:13:46.840]  And I don't have for it in the screen.
[2:13:46.840 --> 2:13:47.840]  Right.
[2:13:47.840 --> 2:13:52.840]  And I'm kind of bummed out by the, you know, Yosemite look.
[2:13:52.840 --> 2:13:53.840]  Yeah.
[2:13:53.840 --> 2:13:57.840]  One day, hopefully soon, I'll be able to upgrade.
[2:13:57.840 --> 2:14:00.840]  But no, I totally agree with you that the, I think it's fine.
[2:14:00.840 --> 2:14:04.840]  I think every now and then there's going to be a jump.
[2:14:04.840 --> 2:14:06.840]  And something is going to be degraded.
[2:14:06.840 --> 2:14:07.840]  Yeah.
[2:14:07.840 --> 2:14:12.840]  And you know, to bring it back to the fireball piece that we talked
[2:14:12.840 --> 2:14:18.840]  about previously and techno 2034, every now and then you take it,
[2:14:18.840 --> 2:14:21.840]  you take your lumps, you take a step back.
[2:14:21.840 --> 2:14:27.840]  And it lets you sort of move into the future little bit more.
[2:14:27.840 --> 2:14:30.840]  And I think Yosemite is one of those kind of releases.
[2:14:30.840 --> 2:14:31.840]  Yeah.
[2:14:31.840 --> 2:14:32.840]  I agree.
[2:14:32.840 --> 2:14:33.840]  Yeah.
[2:14:33.840 --> 2:14:34.840]  I'll have to link.
[2:14:34.840 --> 2:14:35.840]  I'll put it in the show notes.
[2:14:35.840 --> 2:14:36.840]  I'll link up that.
[2:14:36.840 --> 2:14:37.840]  You really should.
[2:14:37.840 --> 2:14:38.840]  You know what?
[2:14:38.840 --> 2:14:39.840]  It's a great article.
[2:14:39.840 --> 2:14:41.840]  And I disagree with like 90% of this.
[2:14:41.840 --> 2:14:45.840]  Well, because I mean, it's easy to say now.
[2:14:45.840 --> 2:14:46.840]  And I did it.
[2:14:46.840 --> 2:14:48.840]  I did it at the time, but I can't prove it.
[2:14:48.840 --> 2:14:51.840]  Like a lot of this is like probably wrong, right?
[2:14:51.840 --> 2:14:54.840]  Or at least history didn't bury you out.
[2:14:54.840 --> 2:14:57.840]  But this is, I kept reading you.
[2:14:57.840 --> 2:15:01.840]  And this is one of the reasons why I'm like, this is a very
[2:15:01.840 --> 2:15:02.840]  smart piece.
[2:15:02.840 --> 2:15:03.840]  Very well considered.
[2:15:03.840 --> 2:15:05.840]  I disagree with the conclusions.
[2:15:05.840 --> 2:15:08.840]  A lot of it though is our stuff that could never really be settled.
[2:15:08.840 --> 2:15:09.840]  Yeah.
[2:15:09.840 --> 2:15:10.840]  I know.
[2:15:10.840 --> 2:15:11.840]  Final name extensions.
[2:15:11.840 --> 2:15:13.840]  Final name extensions is perfect.
[2:15:13.840 --> 2:15:15.840]  And the file paths is another one.
[2:15:15.840 --> 2:15:17.840]  The file pass thing was just stupid.
[2:15:17.840 --> 2:15:21.840]  I could, I could do another show about all of this.
[2:15:21.840 --> 2:15:22.840]  Yes.
[2:15:22.840 --> 2:15:24.840]  I remember at some point, I mean, we had, we had software
[2:15:24.840 --> 2:15:28.840]  updaters in the 90s for the classic Mac OS that no matter where
[2:15:28.840 --> 2:15:30.840]  you put the application on your hard disk, if you ran the
[2:15:30.840 --> 2:15:34.840]  updater, it would find it because it would find the app by
[2:15:34.840 --> 2:15:37.840]  an identifier and then update the app to the latest version.
[2:15:37.840 --> 2:15:39.840]  So you didn't have to put it in a special folder.
[2:15:39.840 --> 2:15:41.840]  And then I remember I forget which app it was.
[2:15:41.840 --> 2:15:45.840]  If it was I photo or one of the I like iTunes or I photo.
[2:15:45.840 --> 2:15:51.840]  But the next guys wrote an updater in like 2002 or 2003 or so.
[2:15:51.840 --> 2:15:52.840]  I got it.
[2:15:52.840 --> 2:15:53.840]  So do you know what?
[2:15:53.840 --> 2:15:54.840]  It's the very next article.
[2:15:54.840 --> 2:15:58.840]  It's the very next article in Derring Fireball called Finding Abby.
[2:15:58.840 --> 2:16:01.840]  You had, you had your knives out there.
[2:16:01.840 --> 2:16:02.840]  Yeah, it did.
[2:16:02.840 --> 2:16:03.840]  It's been in.
[2:16:03.840 --> 2:16:05.840]  I don't know why, but you did.
[2:16:05.840 --> 2:16:08.840]  Yeah, you'd run the iTunes updater.
[2:16:08.840 --> 2:16:12.840]  And it would, it would nuke your whole hard drive.
[2:16:12.840 --> 2:16:16.840]  If you, if you had like renamed the hard, your hard disk.
[2:16:16.840 --> 2:16:18.840]  Have you done anything clever at all?
[2:16:18.840 --> 2:16:20.840]  It would nuke your hard drive.
[2:16:20.840 --> 2:16:23.840]  Which is because it was making assumptions about the paths.
[2:16:23.840 --> 2:16:24.840]  Yeah.
[2:16:24.840 --> 2:16:25.840]  Oh, totally.
[2:16:25.840 --> 2:16:26.840]  It was awful.
[2:16:26.840 --> 2:16:27.840]  Rough time.
[2:16:27.840 --> 2:16:30.840]  You know what though?
[2:16:30.840 --> 2:16:33.840]  I'm going to try to address this a little bit.
[2:16:33.840 --> 2:16:36.840]  A friend of ours who went on to manage.
[2:16:36.840 --> 2:16:40.840]  I message game center and all that kind of stuff.
[2:16:40.840 --> 2:16:42.840]  Do you know the guy I'm talking about?
[2:16:42.840 --> 2:16:43.840]  Yeah, I know exactly.
[2:16:43.840 --> 2:16:44.840]  Okay.
[2:16:44.840 --> 2:16:49.840]  So apparently my belief is one of his first gigs was like,
[2:16:49.840 --> 2:16:51.840]  they can't the guy that wrote that installer
[2:16:51.840 --> 2:16:53.840]  and his thing was to fix it.
[2:16:53.840 --> 2:16:59.840]  That's kind of holy.
[2:16:59.840 --> 2:17:00.840]  It's great.
[2:17:00.840 --> 2:17:01.840]  Right.
[2:17:01.840 --> 2:17:03.840]  I feel bad.
[2:17:03.840 --> 2:17:04.840]  I know.
[2:17:04.840 --> 2:17:06.840]  I don't want to be, I mean mistakes.
[2:17:06.840 --> 2:17:08.840]  Especially if I don't, I really, I'm not laughing at the guy.
[2:17:08.840 --> 2:17:10.840]  I'm just laughing at the circumstance.
[2:17:10.840 --> 2:17:12.840]  Like, shit happens.
[2:17:12.840 --> 2:17:13.840]  You know what?
[2:17:13.840 --> 2:17:15.840]  I was like the way that you said I really had it out
[2:17:15.840 --> 2:17:17.840]  for a, for Avi to Vanyan back then.
[2:17:17.840 --> 2:17:18.840]  I don't know what you did.
[2:17:18.840 --> 2:17:20.840]  I really didn't understand it.
[2:17:20.840 --> 2:17:22.840]  In hindsight, I feel a little,
[2:17:22.840 --> 2:17:23.840]  uh, it was immature.
[2:17:23.840 --> 2:17:25.840]  Even if I was in my 30s.
[2:17:25.840 --> 2:17:26.840]  Yeah.
[2:17:26.840 --> 2:17:28.840]  But it's like two in a row that you're like,
[2:17:28.840 --> 2:17:29.840]  fuck this happy.
[2:17:29.840 --> 2:17:30.840]  Well, it was Penn.
[2:17:30.840 --> 2:17:31.840]  He's not some dude.
[2:17:31.840 --> 2:17:33.840]  He's done like a little great stuff, right?
[2:17:33.840 --> 2:17:34.840]  Yeah.
[2:17:34.840 --> 2:17:35.840]  And in hindsight, you know, it's, you know,
[2:17:35.840 --> 2:17:37.840]  help turn Apple around, you know.
[2:17:37.840 --> 2:17:38.840]  And, you know what?
[2:17:38.840 --> 2:17:40.840]  And I even, I even acknowledge in the article,
[2:17:40.840 --> 2:17:44.840]  even acknowledging the article that the classic Mac OS updates.
[2:17:44.840 --> 2:17:45.840]  Yeah.
[2:17:45.840 --> 2:17:46.840]  Next.
[2:17:46.840 --> 2:17:47.840]  For the, for him.
[2:17:47.840 --> 2:17:49.840]  And they were outstanding.
[2:17:49.840 --> 2:17:51.840]  So it was, uh,
[2:17:51.840 --> 2:17:53.840]  it was eight to nine for whatever.
[2:17:53.840 --> 2:17:54.840]  Yeah.
[2:17:54.840 --> 2:17:56.840]  But especially, especially eight point.
[2:17:56.840 --> 2:17:57.840]  I think eight.
[2:17:57.840 --> 2:17:58.840]  Eight.
[2:17:58.840 --> 2:17:59.840]  Eight point five was.
[2:17:59.840 --> 2:18:00.840]  Whoa.
[2:18:00.840 --> 2:18:01.840]  Okay.
[2:18:01.840 --> 2:18:02.840]  Maybe eight one.
[2:18:02.840 --> 2:18:03.840]  Eight point five was big as I think it.
[2:18:03.840 --> 2:18:04.840]  Yep.
[2:18:04.840 --> 2:18:06.840]  Put quick draw on power PC.
[2:18:06.840 --> 2:18:07.840]  Yeah.
[2:18:07.840 --> 2:18:08.840]  Yeah.
[2:18:08.840 --> 2:18:09.840]  And I don't know.
[2:18:09.840 --> 2:18:12.840]  I'm definitely if you with my classic Mac OS history.
[2:18:12.840 --> 2:18:13.840]  Yeah.
[2:18:13.840 --> 2:18:15.840]  But there was a lot of good work down there.
[2:18:15.840 --> 2:18:16.840]  Like a lot.
[2:18:16.840 --> 2:18:18.840]  And it was all into him.
[2:18:18.840 --> 2:18:19.840]  Yeah.
[2:18:19.840 --> 2:18:20.840]  And then you just go.
[2:18:20.840 --> 2:18:22.840]  But I acknowledge that though.
[2:18:22.840 --> 2:18:23.840]  You did.
[2:18:23.840 --> 2:18:26.840]  But I don't understand what the animosity was.
[2:18:26.840 --> 2:18:29.840]  Well, you know, it was.
[2:18:29.840 --> 2:18:32.840]  File extensions.
[2:18:32.840 --> 2:18:37.840]  Was it like a just a narrative device?
[2:18:37.840 --> 2:18:38.840]  Which is cool.
[2:18:38.840 --> 2:18:39.840]  I don't know.
[2:18:39.840 --> 2:18:43.840]  I was a little bit and I was a little bit more.
[2:18:43.840 --> 2:18:49.840]  Less hesitant to go a little over the top, you know, to fill the glass.
[2:18:49.840 --> 2:18:53.840]  Oh, he says you're because I didn't have a big audience.
[2:18:53.840 --> 2:18:55.840]  It was a very small audience.
[2:18:55.840 --> 2:18:59.840]  I didn't like I would never have expected that he would read what I wrote.
[2:18:59.840 --> 2:19:00.840]  And maybe he did.
[2:19:00.840 --> 2:19:01.840]  I don't know.
[2:19:01.840 --> 2:19:02.840]  It was now today.
[2:19:02.840 --> 2:19:05.840]  I know that if I wrote something like that, that whoever it is with Apple would read it.
[2:19:05.840 --> 2:19:08.840]  And not that I'm afraid to write anything critical if someone had Apple.
[2:19:08.840 --> 2:19:09.840]  Yeah.
[2:19:09.840 --> 2:19:10.840]  But it would be more measured.
[2:19:10.840 --> 2:19:11.840]  Right.
[2:19:11.840 --> 2:19:12.840]  Yeah.
[2:19:12.840 --> 2:19:15.840]  I want to have my ducks in a row and make sure that it is not over the top.
[2:19:15.840 --> 2:19:19.840]  I want it to be at the exact right level of.
[2:19:19.840 --> 2:19:20.840]  Yeah.
[2:19:20.840 --> 2:19:23.840]  These two posts to me are literally fireballs.
[2:19:23.840 --> 2:19:24.840]  Yeah.
[2:19:24.840 --> 2:19:27.840]  Which is not to say that you don't love them now.
[2:19:27.840 --> 2:19:29.840]  And I don't mean to take that away from me.
[2:19:29.840 --> 2:19:31.840]  But this is just.
[2:19:31.840 --> 2:19:32.840]  Yeah.
[2:19:32.840 --> 2:19:35.840]  It's like a bit more headstrong than I think you would be now.
[2:19:35.840 --> 2:19:37.840]  I think you'd be more measured.
[2:19:37.840 --> 2:19:43.840]  And it's like my use of the word jackass where I was used to be freer with it.
[2:19:43.840 --> 2:19:44.840]  Yeah.
[2:19:44.840 --> 2:19:46.840]  And I don't think I ever once used it.
[2:19:46.840 --> 2:19:48.840]  Maybe there's one time where I regretted it a little bit.
[2:19:48.840 --> 2:19:51.840]  But I miss those jackass if a week was funny.
[2:19:51.840 --> 2:19:52.840]  It was funny.
[2:19:52.840 --> 2:19:54.840]  But and it was usually people being jackasses.
[2:19:54.840 --> 2:19:58.840]  But it got to the point where I realized though that a lot of people who I would call jackass
[2:19:58.840 --> 2:20:00.840]  to the week when you googled them.
[2:20:00.840 --> 2:20:03.840]  The first hit was me calling them a jackass.
[2:20:03.840 --> 2:20:04.840]  That's horrible.
[2:20:04.840 --> 2:20:05.840]  You don't mean that.
[2:20:05.840 --> 2:20:06.840]  I don't.
[2:20:06.840 --> 2:20:07.840]  But I did mean no.
[2:20:07.840 --> 2:20:09.840]  But I always meant though.
[2:20:09.840 --> 2:20:13.840]  When I said someone was being a jackass that they were literally being a jackass.
[2:20:13.840 --> 2:20:16.840]  They were being willfully ignorant or willfully deceitful.
[2:20:16.840 --> 2:20:18.840]  This particular choice is bad.
[2:20:18.840 --> 2:20:19.840]  Doesn't mean that they're.
[2:20:19.840 --> 2:20:20.840]  You don't type that anything.
[2:20:20.840 --> 2:20:21.840]  Right.
[2:20:21.840 --> 2:20:24.840]  But I use a way to come up with like, oh, they were jackass like that.
[2:20:24.840 --> 2:20:27.840]  I use it way less frequently now though because I know that I've, you know,
[2:20:27.840 --> 2:20:30.840]  during fireball is more widely read and more influential.
[2:20:30.840 --> 2:20:31.840]  Yeah.
[2:20:31.840 --> 2:20:32.840]  And that was a conscious decision though.
[2:20:32.840 --> 2:20:33.840]  Right.
[2:20:33.840 --> 2:20:34.840]  Right.
[2:20:34.840 --> 2:20:37.840]  And it's the same way where if my criticism of like an Apple executive or
[2:20:37.840 --> 2:20:39.840]  something like that is.
[2:20:39.840 --> 2:20:42.840]  I try to be more measured now.
[2:20:42.840 --> 2:20:45.840]  But without being, you know, I don't want to be dull.
[2:20:45.840 --> 2:20:47.840]  And I don't hold back.
[2:20:47.840 --> 2:20:48.840]  No, no, no.
[2:20:48.840 --> 2:20:49.840]  You know, like I said,
[2:20:49.840 --> 2:20:51.840]  the best way I can put it is I don't want to go over the top.
[2:20:51.840 --> 2:20:52.840]  I want to get right to the top.
[2:20:52.840 --> 2:20:53.840]  I want to make sure it's accurate.
[2:20:53.840 --> 2:20:56.840]  Whereas in the early days, I would felt free to go over the top
[2:20:56.840 --> 2:20:59.840]  because I didn't feel that there were any repercussions from it.
[2:20:59.840 --> 2:21:00.840]  Yeah.
[2:21:00.840 --> 2:21:02.840]  And I don't mean to be blog critic.
[2:21:02.840 --> 2:21:06.840]  But so the second piece about Ivy,
[2:21:06.840 --> 2:21:09.840]  immediately after the other one, finding Ivy,
[2:21:09.840 --> 2:21:13.840]  literally starts with handful of readers emailed to complain about
[2:21:13.840 --> 2:21:18.840]  Monday's mixed review of Ivy Tibernian's legacy at Apple's vice president
[2:21:18.840 --> 2:21:20.840]  and software engineering.
[2:21:20.840 --> 2:21:25.840]  And you dress your head on.
[2:21:25.840 --> 2:21:27.840]  Which is one of the reasons I'm like, man,
[2:21:27.840 --> 2:21:30.840]  if I can totally disagree with this guy.
[2:21:30.840 --> 2:21:34.840]  But good work, you know.
[2:21:34.840 --> 2:21:37.840]  Boy, those articles are way down in New York.
[2:21:37.840 --> 2:21:38.840]  Yeah.
[2:21:38.840 --> 2:21:39.840]  They're way back.
[2:21:39.840 --> 2:21:41.840]  And it's totally unfair to hold them to you.
[2:21:41.840 --> 2:21:42.840]  Well, I will link them up.
[2:21:42.840 --> 2:21:43.840]  All right, we should end the show.
[2:21:43.840 --> 2:21:44.840]  But I will put them in the show notes.
[2:21:44.840 --> 2:21:45.840]  Or at least I'll put one in the show notes.
[2:21:45.840 --> 2:21:47.840]  And then you get everybody wants to read them.
[2:21:47.840 --> 2:21:52.840]  You can keep reading next previous article to the time.
[2:21:52.840 --> 2:21:53.840]  What was the time?
[2:21:53.840 --> 2:21:55.840]  2003?
[2:21:55.840 --> 2:21:57.840]  Yeah, it was like a long time ago.
[2:21:57.840 --> 2:21:59.840]  Well, I can search for his name.
[2:21:59.840 --> 2:22:00.840]  Yeah.
[2:22:00.840 --> 2:22:01.840]  How do you say, Ivy?
[2:22:01.840 --> 2:22:02.840]  Funny.
[2:22:02.840 --> 2:22:03.840]  Thank you.
[2:22:03.840 --> 2:22:04.840]  Such a dick.
[2:22:04.840 --> 2:22:06.840]  It was awesome.
[2:22:06.840 --> 2:22:14.840]  So this is very oblique and probably pretty inside baseball.
[2:22:14.840 --> 2:22:20.840]  I loved the Ben flip-flopped as opinion on the watch introduction.
[2:22:20.840 --> 2:22:22.840]  I thought that was great.
[2:22:22.840 --> 2:22:23.840]  I really did.
[2:22:23.840 --> 2:22:24.840]  And it's speak.
[2:22:24.840 --> 2:22:29.840]  I mean, I'm only bringing up because I've read these articles back
[2:22:29.840 --> 2:22:30.840]  on the day.
[2:22:30.840 --> 2:22:33.840]  And I was like, I had to disagree with a lot of this.
[2:22:33.840 --> 2:22:36.840]  And I sometimes read Ben's pieces.
[2:22:36.840 --> 2:22:38.840]  And I'm like, kind of disagree.
[2:22:38.840 --> 2:22:41.840]  But so well thought out.
[2:22:41.840 --> 2:22:44.840]  Like, good, you know, smart guy.
[2:22:44.840 --> 2:22:46.840]  Very, very smart guy.
[2:22:46.840 --> 2:22:47.840]  Yeah.
[2:22:47.840 --> 2:22:48.840]  No, it reminds me of the thing.
[2:22:48.840 --> 2:22:53.840]  Just like two weeks ago, linked to Jason Friedman, where he, you know,
[2:22:53.840 --> 2:22:57.840]  that Bezos was addressing 30, what's not the base camp now?
[2:22:57.840 --> 2:22:58.840]  Not 37 signals.
[2:22:58.840 --> 2:23:00.840]  But came in and did like a Q&A.
[2:23:00.840 --> 2:23:03.840]  And he's, you know, I'm sure he's not the first person to say it.
[2:23:03.840 --> 2:23:05.840]  But here's how you can be right most of the time.
[2:23:05.840 --> 2:23:06.840]  Be willing to change your mind.
[2:23:06.840 --> 2:23:07.840]  Yeah.
[2:23:07.840 --> 2:23:08.840]  I love that.
[2:23:08.840 --> 2:23:09.840]  You know, because you'll be wrong.
[2:23:09.840 --> 2:23:10.840]  And then you'll change your mind.
[2:23:10.840 --> 2:23:12.840]  And then it's just funny.
[2:23:12.840 --> 2:23:14.840]  And Ben did that with the watch.
[2:23:14.840 --> 2:23:18.840]  And, you know, had like a sort of almost scathing initial take on it.
[2:23:18.840 --> 2:23:21.840]  And then we could talk to himself into being one of the biggest
[2:23:21.840 --> 2:23:22.840]  proponents out there.
[2:23:22.840 --> 2:23:23.840]  Right.
[2:23:23.840 --> 2:23:29.840]  And there was a similar thing with Steve Jobs and Tim Cook.
[2:23:29.840 --> 2:23:32.840]  And, you know, it came out after Steve died.
[2:23:32.840 --> 2:23:36.840]  But like Tim's first, you know, D, whatever conference, you know,
[2:23:36.840 --> 2:23:39.840]  he said he was, he was the world's biggest flip flapper and
[2:23:39.840 --> 2:23:40.840]  waffle in the world.
[2:23:40.840 --> 2:23:41.840]  But that's what made him great.
[2:23:41.840 --> 2:23:43.840]  Was one day he'd tell you this is a terrible idea.
[2:23:43.840 --> 2:23:44.840]  It's awful.
[2:23:44.840 --> 2:23:46.840]  And then he'd come in the next day and say, I have a great idea.
[2:23:46.840 --> 2:23:47.840]  And it was your idea.
[2:23:47.840 --> 2:23:48.840]  Yeah.
[2:23:48.840 --> 2:23:52.840]  That, you know, that his refute, you know, that he was open to
[2:23:52.840 --> 2:23:55.840]  anything, you know, we're never going to make an iTunes for
[2:23:55.840 --> 2:23:56.840]  Windows.
[2:23:56.840 --> 2:23:57.840]  Okay, we'll make iTunes for Windows.
[2:23:57.840 --> 2:24:01.840]  And then, you know, iPod for Windows becomes, you know, a huge
[2:24:01.840 --> 2:24:05.840]  hit over and over and over again.
[2:24:05.840 --> 2:24:07.840]  And then, you know, it just comes up with people who, you know,
[2:24:07.840 --> 2:24:10.840]  have quotes of Steve Jobs saying that, you know, eight inch tablets
[2:24:10.840 --> 2:24:13.840]  or a terrible idea or, you know, nobody's ever going to buy a
[2:24:13.840 --> 2:24:14.840]  big phone.
[2:24:14.840 --> 2:24:16.840]  But it's proof that Apple is doing things they wouldn't have done
[2:24:16.840 --> 2:24:17.840]  under Steve Jobs.
[2:24:17.840 --> 2:24:18.840]  No.
[2:24:18.840 --> 2:24:20.840]  I mean, it's, you know, the market changes, you know?
[2:24:20.840 --> 2:24:22.840]  No, it's not even the market.
[2:24:22.840 --> 2:24:24.840]  I mean, good lines change.
[2:24:24.840 --> 2:24:25.840]  Yeah.
[2:24:25.840 --> 2:24:26.840]  Exactly.
[2:24:26.840 --> 2:24:28.840]  That's a great way of putting it.
[2:24:28.840 --> 2:24:33.840]  I think there is a huge, I think it is an error to
[2:24:33.840 --> 2:24:36.840]  kind of nice Steve Jobs.
[2:24:36.840 --> 2:24:41.840]  I don't want to take that away from him.
[2:24:41.840 --> 2:24:44.840]  But, you know, his is not the would of God.
[2:24:44.840 --> 2:24:46.840]  Like, it's not said in stone.
[2:24:46.840 --> 2:24:50.840]  Well, it's that word, the word from the, you know, again,
[2:24:50.840 --> 2:24:53.840]  not to get bring too much actual religion into it, but with the
[2:24:53.840 --> 2:24:54.840]  Catholic church infallibility.
[2:24:54.840 --> 2:24:55.840]  Right.
[2:24:55.840 --> 2:24:56.840]  Exactly.
[2:24:56.840 --> 2:24:57.840]  Yeah.
[2:24:57.840 --> 2:24:58.840]  He's not the whole proof that, yeah.
[2:24:58.840 --> 2:24:59.840]  Right.
[2:24:59.840 --> 2:25:00.840]  The Pope is held as infallible.
[2:25:00.840 --> 2:25:03.840]  And, you know, it's, it's a real problem.
[2:25:03.840 --> 2:25:06.840]  Because, you know, human beings aren't actually infallible.
[2:25:06.840 --> 2:25:09.840]  But, you know, but there's a tendency among many to view.
[2:25:09.840 --> 2:25:12.840]  And it's funny because it comes from both sides, though.
[2:25:12.840 --> 2:25:16.840]  And also, it comes from like even like the die hard android
[2:25:16.840 --> 2:25:19.840]  types who say, I thought Steve Jobs was infallible.
[2:25:19.840 --> 2:25:21.840]  And he said nobody would buy a financial.
[2:25:21.840 --> 2:25:22.840]  Right.
[2:25:22.840 --> 2:25:24.840]  And effectively, which is right.
[2:25:24.840 --> 2:25:27.840]  And, you know, and it's also combined with the fact that
[2:25:27.840 --> 2:25:30.840]  what's true in 2011 is not true in 2014.
[2:25:30.840 --> 2:25:31.840]  Right.
[2:25:31.840 --> 2:25:36.840]  So, I mean, I believe this is in your tourist room,
[2:25:36.840 --> 2:25:37.840]  somewhere.
[2:25:37.840 --> 2:25:41.840]  You know, there was a guy telling neat and
[2:25:41.840 --> 2:25:46.840]  canatra that Apple doesn't behave in a certain way.
[2:25:46.840 --> 2:25:49.840]  And, you know, neat and then the eye away.
[2:25:49.840 --> 2:25:54.840]  He was the director of iOS apps.
[2:25:54.840 --> 2:26:00.840]  And I think that there's a projected view of the way that Apple
[2:26:00.840 --> 2:26:04.840]  doesn't does not operate.
[2:26:04.840 --> 2:26:09.840]  And where it will innovate and where it will just,
[2:26:09.840 --> 2:26:11.840]  I mean, just.
[2:26:11.840 --> 2:26:16.840]  But where it adopts the common, you know,
[2:26:16.840 --> 2:26:20.840]  implementation, the lack of a better
[2:26:20.840 --> 2:26:22.840]  where the compatibility option.
[2:26:22.840 --> 2:26:23.840]  Right.
[2:26:23.840 --> 2:26:27.840]  And I think, you know, with the file extensions and the
[2:26:27.840 --> 2:26:32.840]  credit codes and all of that, I think Apple did cave
[2:26:32.840 --> 2:26:35.840]  from something that might have been better,
[2:26:35.840 --> 2:26:41.840]  but they caved in order to achieve compatibility.
[2:26:41.840 --> 2:26:45.840]  And I notice that you put that in quotes and want to get to it.
[2:26:45.840 --> 2:26:48.840]  But a compatibility with broader computing world.
[2:26:48.840 --> 2:26:52.840]  And they did so in order to achieve
[2:26:52.840 --> 2:26:56.840]  the ability to communicate with the outside world better.
[2:26:56.840 --> 2:27:00.840]  Which I think was a smart choice given the time, right?
[2:27:00.840 --> 2:27:04.840]  Like communicating was just about to become essential.
[2:27:04.840 --> 2:27:08.840]  I agree with that to some degree.
[2:27:08.840 --> 2:27:11.840]  I would at least say that there's a, it wasn't an
[2:27:11.840 --> 2:27:12.840]  unreasonable.
[2:27:12.840 --> 2:27:14.840]  The other side of the argument wasn't unreasonable.
[2:27:14.840 --> 2:27:15.840]  No, I don't think so.
[2:27:15.840 --> 2:27:17.840]  Which is why I've read you in Syracuse.
[2:27:17.840 --> 2:27:18.840]  Right.
[2:27:18.840 --> 2:27:20.840]  It was different sets of trade-offs and what do you value
[2:27:20.840 --> 2:27:21.840]  more?
[2:27:21.840 --> 2:27:24.840]  And I just, you know, you know, and again,
[2:27:24.840 --> 2:27:27.840]  you might be right though that in the long run it worked out better
[2:27:27.840 --> 2:27:29.840]  going with those decisions then.
[2:27:29.840 --> 2:27:33.840]  And, you know, one of the reasons why is that ultimately we
[2:27:33.840 --> 2:27:37.840]  resulted with iOS where the actual file system is hidden.
[2:27:37.840 --> 2:27:38.840]  Right.
[2:27:38.840 --> 2:27:41.840]  Which I think Newton is a big proponent of.
[2:27:41.840 --> 2:27:42.840]  Yeah.
[2:27:42.840 --> 2:27:46.840]  That's fine to me because then it doesn't matter if under the
[2:27:46.840 --> 2:27:50.840]  hood it's a case sensitive file system with file extensions.
[2:27:50.840 --> 2:27:51.840]  Which I think it still is.
[2:27:51.840 --> 2:27:55.840]  Yeah.
[2:27:55.840 --> 2:27:56.840]  Which is fine.
[2:27:56.840 --> 2:27:59.840]  I would argue against that vehemently if they ever did that with the
[2:27:59.840 --> 2:28:01.840]  Mac where the file system matters.
[2:28:01.840 --> 2:28:03.840]  Well, it's because it's exposed to you.
[2:28:03.840 --> 2:28:04.840]  But right.
[2:28:04.840 --> 2:28:06.840]  And to usual users, right?
[2:28:06.840 --> 2:28:07.840]  Right.
[2:28:07.840 --> 2:28:10.840]  You know, I can conceive of a Mac 10 years from now or maybe
[2:28:10.840 --> 2:28:14.840]  even last maybe five years from now where it's the file system is
[2:28:14.840 --> 2:28:16.840]  only for people who've installed Xcode.
[2:28:16.840 --> 2:28:17.840]  Right.
[2:28:17.840 --> 2:28:20.840]  So I have a difference between the presentation versus the
[2:28:20.840 --> 2:28:21.840]  presentation.
[2:28:21.840 --> 2:28:22.840]  Right.
[2:28:22.840 --> 2:28:24.840]  Where the presentation is what you see as a user and the
[2:28:24.840 --> 2:28:27.840]  representation is why X is actually happening on disk.
[2:28:27.840 --> 2:28:28.840]  Right.
[2:28:28.840 --> 2:28:32.840]  And I think file systems in a lot of ways have often favored
[2:28:32.840 --> 2:28:38.840]  exposing a representation of exactly what's happening rather
[2:28:38.840 --> 2:28:45.840]  than, you know, projecting a view that is more useful to the
[2:28:45.840 --> 2:28:46.840]  user.
[2:28:46.840 --> 2:28:47.840]  Right.
[2:28:47.840 --> 2:28:50.840]  So in my analogy on file system or file name extensions as a
[2:28:50.840 --> 2:28:54.840]  user exposed feature has always been that.
[2:28:54.840 --> 2:28:55.840]  They're bullshit.
[2:28:55.840 --> 2:28:56.840]  It's awful.
[2:28:56.840 --> 2:28:58.840]  It's two pieces of data.
[2:28:58.840 --> 2:28:59.840]  Makes sense.
[2:28:59.840 --> 2:29:03.840]  In one field separated by an orbit just a piece of
[2:29:03.840 --> 2:29:06.840]  a piece of text, just a dot.
[2:29:06.840 --> 2:29:08.840]  There's a church sitting there between the two.
[2:29:08.840 --> 2:29:09.840]  Right.
[2:29:09.840 --> 2:29:13.840]  And so it's easily, you know, it's easily changed, you know,
[2:29:13.840 --> 2:29:17.840]  if you want to, but it, you know, I can't tell you any times,
[2:29:17.840 --> 2:29:19.840]  I've talked to people who thought that the way you convert a
[2:29:19.840 --> 2:29:23.840]  ping to a JPEG is to erase the PNG and type JPG.
[2:29:23.840 --> 2:29:24.840]  Do you know what?
[2:29:24.840 --> 2:29:25.840]  That should actually work.
[2:29:25.840 --> 2:29:26.840]  It should.
[2:29:26.840 --> 2:29:28.840]  That would be amazing if it worked.
[2:29:28.840 --> 2:29:31.840]  I could see, you know, again, the finder should do that.
[2:29:31.840 --> 2:29:32.840]  That should work.
[2:29:32.840 --> 2:29:33.840]  Right.
[2:29:33.840 --> 2:29:34.840]  It should say I noticed you did that.
[2:29:34.840 --> 2:29:36.840]  Would you like me to change this to a JPEG?
[2:29:36.840 --> 2:29:37.840]  That would be amazing.
[2:29:37.840 --> 2:29:39.840]  But it guess what?
[2:29:39.840 --> 2:29:40.840]  That doesn't actually happen.
[2:29:40.840 --> 2:29:41.840]  And it didn't happen there.
[2:29:41.840 --> 2:29:44.840]  But people, I can see why normal, to a normal person, it should work.
[2:29:44.840 --> 2:29:45.840]  Right.
[2:29:45.840 --> 2:29:48.840]  And to me, it's just like, well, why not put the creation and
[2:29:48.840 --> 2:29:50.840]  modification date in there, too?
[2:29:50.840 --> 2:29:53.840]  And then you have to have a date and a name and a file extension
[2:29:53.840 --> 2:29:54.840]  all in one field.
[2:29:54.840 --> 2:29:56.840]  Ah, you just make a JPEG.
[2:29:56.840 --> 2:29:58.840]  No, it's the exact same.
[2:29:58.840 --> 2:29:59.840]  I understand.
[2:29:59.840 --> 2:30:00.840]  Okay.
[2:30:00.840 --> 2:30:01.840]  And it's the file system.
[2:30:01.840 --> 2:30:02.840]  Same thing.
[2:30:02.840 --> 2:30:05.840]  The file system has always had a field for the creation date and
[2:30:05.840 --> 2:30:06.840]  the modification date.
[2:30:06.840 --> 2:30:08.840]  And it's different from the name.
[2:30:08.840 --> 2:30:10.840]  And it never had a field for the type.
[2:30:10.840 --> 2:30:11.840]  And it should have.
[2:30:11.840 --> 2:30:13.840]  I mean, do you want to go over the history of this?
[2:30:13.840 --> 2:30:17.840]  No, but I'm just saying that two pieces of data in the same field
[2:30:17.840 --> 2:30:18.840]  is occludes.
[2:30:18.840 --> 2:30:20.840]  And the Mac didn't suffer from that.
[2:30:20.840 --> 2:30:22.840]  The Mac had something that was more graceful.
[2:30:22.840 --> 2:30:24.840]  And it wasn't built for the future.
[2:30:24.840 --> 2:30:27.840]  And it wasn't built for compatibility with anybody else.
[2:30:27.840 --> 2:30:28.840]  Right.
[2:30:28.840 --> 2:30:30.840]  But they should have only replaced it with something that was
[2:30:30.840 --> 2:30:33.840]  better, not with something that was more primitive.
[2:30:33.840 --> 2:30:39.840]  I think file name extensions were used to build a name
[2:30:39.840 --> 2:30:40.840]  of file.
[2:30:40.840 --> 2:30:43.840]  And whatever type it was, didn't matter.
[2:30:43.840 --> 2:30:46.840]  It was assumed that you'd be able to feed it into the correct app.
[2:30:46.840 --> 2:30:51.840]  This is before Dewey's old school stuff, right?
[2:30:51.840 --> 2:30:58.840]  When it became apparent that we would have file formats that
[2:30:58.840 --> 2:31:02.840]  would work in not just one application, but in multiple
[2:31:02.840 --> 2:31:06.840]  applications, extensions were born, right?
[2:31:06.840 --> 2:31:11.840]  And the way that that got addressed was just being literally
[2:31:11.840 --> 2:31:14.840]  appended to the end of the file name.
[2:31:14.840 --> 2:31:19.840]  It's the most pragmatic workman-like thing you can do.
[2:31:19.840 --> 2:31:25.840]  And it was so obvious and so basic that I think.
[2:31:25.840 --> 2:31:28.840]  Pretty much universally, it was adopted.
[2:31:28.840 --> 2:31:31.840]  The Mac tried to throw it off.
[2:31:31.840 --> 2:31:35.840]  And I think ultimately it failed because it didn't.
[2:31:35.840 --> 2:31:39.840]  It didn't command the market share that could really make it
[2:31:39.840 --> 2:31:41.840]  happen, you know what I mean?
[2:31:41.840 --> 2:31:44.840]  No, but it wasn't a problem for Mac users, though.
[2:31:44.840 --> 2:31:47.840]  So when you download, in the old days when you would download
[2:31:47.840 --> 2:31:51.840]  a GIF file, and on the server that it was coming from,
[2:31:51.840 --> 2:31:55.840]  it didn't have any type code because it wasn't a Mac server.
[2:31:55.840 --> 2:31:57.840]  It would just come down.
[2:31:57.840 --> 2:32:00.840]  Whatever software you downloaded it with would look at the file
[2:32:00.840 --> 2:32:03.840]  extension and just put the right creator code on, or not
[2:32:03.840 --> 2:32:06.840]  creator code type code.
[2:32:06.840 --> 2:32:08.840]  It would look at the file extension, or would it look at the
[2:32:08.840 --> 2:32:11.840]  MIME type given by the file type?
[2:32:11.840 --> 2:32:13.840]  Yeah, probably the MIME type.
[2:32:13.840 --> 2:32:17.840]  And all the browsers did it, all the FTP clients did it.
[2:32:17.840 --> 2:32:21.840]  It wasn't as much of a problem as you would think it was.
[2:32:21.840 --> 2:32:22.840]  It was not an issue.
[2:32:22.840 --> 2:32:23.840]  No, no, no.
[2:32:23.840 --> 2:32:28.840]  I'm saying this is why the file name extension thing exists and why
[2:32:28.840 --> 2:32:32.840]  I think you can explain it to anybody and anybody would get it.
[2:32:32.840 --> 2:32:35.840]  But I just, in hindsight, to me, it was the big thing.
[2:32:35.840 --> 2:32:37.840]  Isn't which side was right?
[2:32:37.840 --> 2:32:40.840]  It's that everybody was wrong because giving users access to
[2:32:40.840 --> 2:32:43.840]  the file system was wrong in the first place.
[2:32:43.840 --> 2:32:45.840]  I agree with you 100%.
[2:32:45.840 --> 2:32:46.840]  Yeah, right.
[2:32:46.840 --> 2:32:49.840]  And it was what level of technical ability are you expecting
[2:32:49.840 --> 2:32:52.840]  the people who do have access to the file system to have?
[2:32:52.840 --> 2:32:54.840]  Well, so wait, so wait.
[2:32:54.840 --> 2:32:55.840]  I agree with you.
[2:32:55.840 --> 2:33:01.840]  But I don't think it was wrong so much as a necessity at the time.
[2:33:01.840 --> 2:33:05.840]  I mean, the first Mac chips, you've got what?
[2:33:05.840 --> 2:33:08.840]  One was six, six, 40K, six.
[2:33:08.840 --> 2:33:10.840]  No, more than that.
[2:33:10.840 --> 2:33:11.840]  Oh, no.
[2:33:11.840 --> 2:33:12.840]  It was 128K.
[2:33:12.840 --> 2:33:13.840]  What?
[2:33:13.840 --> 2:33:14.840]  28.
[2:33:14.840 --> 2:33:15.840]  Yeah.
[2:33:15.840 --> 2:33:16.840]  Okay.
[2:33:16.840 --> 2:33:19.840]  So whatever it was, you didn't have the resources in order to
[2:33:19.840 --> 2:33:24.840]  abstract a storage system away, right?
[2:33:24.840 --> 2:33:27.840]  And I'm sure that was not even on their minds.
[2:33:27.840 --> 2:33:29.840]  I can't believe this is what we're arguing about.
[2:33:29.840 --> 2:33:30.840]  I don't know if we're arguing.
[2:33:30.840 --> 2:33:31.840]  No, not really.
[2:33:31.840 --> 2:33:33.840]  But here's another factor too.
[2:33:33.840 --> 2:33:36.840]  So the techno 2030 force said use file extensions.
[2:33:36.840 --> 2:33:37.840]  Yeah.
[2:33:37.840 --> 2:33:41.840]  And I think it said use it instead of type and crater code.
[2:33:41.840 --> 2:33:42.840]  I'm not sure.
[2:33:42.840 --> 2:33:43.840]  Yeah.
[2:33:43.840 --> 2:33:46.840]  But it was, but the problem that it ran into is that it broke
[2:33:46.840 --> 2:33:50.840]  the way millions of actual Mac users were using their Macs.
[2:33:50.840 --> 2:33:52.840]  And Mac users did things.
[2:33:52.840 --> 2:33:53.840]  They did.
[2:33:53.840 --> 2:33:54.840]  They did.
[2:33:54.840 --> 2:33:55.840]  Like adorable.
[2:33:55.840 --> 2:33:56.840]  Millions.
[2:33:56.840 --> 2:33:58.840]  That's how many selling a quarter of these days.
[2:33:58.840 --> 2:33:59.840]  Oh, I know.
[2:33:59.840 --> 2:34:00.840]  It's a very small number.
[2:34:00.840 --> 2:34:04.840]  I mean, it was for a long, long time, the estimated user base
[2:34:04.840 --> 2:34:07.840]  of active Mac users hovered.
[2:34:07.840 --> 2:34:10.840]  And that's dangerous when it hovers instead of grows at a
[2:34:10.840 --> 2:34:11.840]  20, 20 million.
[2:34:11.840 --> 2:34:12.840]  Yeah.
[2:34:12.840 --> 2:34:15.840]  I'm going to guess that you do that in a quarter or two
[2:34:15.840 --> 2:34:16.840]  these days.
[2:34:16.840 --> 2:34:17.840]  Yeah.
[2:34:17.840 --> 2:34:18.840]  Well, yeah.
[2:34:18.840 --> 2:34:20.840]  It's like four to five million a quarter, I think.
[2:34:20.840 --> 2:34:21.840]  Yeah.
[2:34:21.840 --> 2:34:22.840]  So okay.
[2:34:22.840 --> 2:34:24.840]  So maybe a year you'll anywhere in that.
[2:34:24.840 --> 2:34:25.840]  Who knows?
[2:34:25.840 --> 2:34:26.840]  Who knows how many are requested?
[2:34:26.840 --> 2:34:27.840]  Yeah.
[2:34:27.840 --> 2:34:31.840]  But the idea, but the hand ringing over that, that person.
[2:34:31.840 --> 2:34:32.840]  I don't know.
[2:34:32.840 --> 2:34:33.840]  I'll let you.
[2:34:33.840 --> 2:34:37.840]  People, as a graphic designer, as an artist, you assume that you
[2:34:37.840 --> 2:34:40.840]  could have files with the same extension that would open when you
[2:34:40.840 --> 2:34:42.840]  double click them would open in different apps.
[2:34:42.840 --> 2:34:45.840]  You know, that the ones you created in Photoshop would open in
[2:34:45.840 --> 2:34:48.840]  Photoshop and the ones you created in, I don't know,
[2:34:48.840 --> 2:34:50.840]  debabilizer would open in debabilizer.
[2:34:50.840 --> 2:34:51.840]  I think that's a great feature.
[2:34:51.840 --> 2:34:54.840]  I think it's a misfeatured when you send that file of the
[2:34:54.840 --> 2:34:57.840]  network and somebody tries to click it.
[2:34:57.840 --> 2:34:58.840]  Right.
[2:34:58.840 --> 2:34:59.840]  I totally like that.
[2:34:59.840 --> 2:35:00.840]  Right.
[2:35:00.840 --> 2:35:01.840]  You don't have that app.
[2:35:01.840 --> 2:35:02.840]  I'm like, I don't care.
[2:35:02.840 --> 2:35:04.840]  I want to open in my app.
[2:35:04.840 --> 2:35:05.840]  Yeah.
[2:35:05.840 --> 2:35:10.840]  I totally agree with that where it did make some problems like that.
[2:35:10.840 --> 2:35:11.840]  But it was just again, it's tradeoffs.
[2:35:11.840 --> 2:35:12.840]  Is it better for me?
[2:35:12.840 --> 2:35:15.840]  Is it better for me to be able to have all my files open right
[2:35:15.840 --> 2:35:16.840]  in the app I made them with?
[2:35:16.840 --> 2:35:19.840]  Or is it better for you when I give them to you that they have the right
[2:35:19.840 --> 2:35:19.840]  code?
[2:35:19.840 --> 2:35:20.840]  Right.
[2:35:20.840 --> 2:35:21.840]  I feel like we could hit a middle ground word.
[2:35:21.840 --> 2:35:26.840]  If you strip off the creative code during transmit panic plug,
[2:35:26.840 --> 2:35:29.840]  transmission, like copying to another computer.
[2:35:29.840 --> 2:35:30.840]  And it would be fine.
[2:35:30.840 --> 2:35:33.840]  And you'd get a new one based on your preferences when it can.
[2:35:33.840 --> 2:35:34.840]  Yeah.
[2:35:34.840 --> 2:35:35.840]  It would be the default.
[2:35:35.840 --> 2:35:36.840]  There'd be no creative code.
[2:35:36.840 --> 2:35:39.840]  But the main point, zoom back at the main point, though, is that none of
[2:35:39.840 --> 2:35:41.840]  these people, none of the graphic design workflows should not have been
[2:35:41.840 --> 2:35:44.840]  built around direct access to the computer file system.
[2:35:44.840 --> 2:35:47.840]  You know, there should have been something a little bit more abstracted.
[2:35:47.840 --> 2:35:49.840]  And the way iOS is gone is ideal.
[2:35:49.840 --> 2:35:51.840]  And it makes everybody happy.
[2:35:51.840 --> 2:35:52.840]  I think so.
[2:35:52.840 --> 2:35:53.840]  I agree.
[2:35:53.840 --> 2:35:55.840]  I mean, it's literally a fresh reboot, right?
[2:35:55.840 --> 2:35:59.840]  And, you know, there's been missteps.
[2:35:59.840 --> 2:36:00.840]  Yeah.
[2:36:00.840 --> 2:36:01.840]  Well, and it's taken a while to get there.
[2:36:01.840 --> 2:36:04.840]  Like, and that's, you know, the whole iOS document picking thing,
[2:36:04.840 --> 2:36:06.840]  which is what everybody brings up is up.
[2:36:06.840 --> 2:36:07.840]  Now we're back with a file system.
[2:36:07.840 --> 2:36:08.840]  It's not the file system.
[2:36:08.840 --> 2:36:11.840]  It's a file system like, what did you call it?
[2:36:11.840 --> 2:36:12.840]  Projection.
[2:36:12.840 --> 2:36:18.840]  And I actually, I don't pat myself on the back that often,
[2:36:18.840 --> 2:36:21.840]  but I really think that projection is the right way to think about
[2:36:21.840 --> 2:36:22.840]  this kind of stuff.
[2:36:22.840 --> 2:36:26.840]  Like that iCloud drive on Yosemite does it.
[2:36:26.840 --> 2:36:31.840]  I think that this is not, we are not looking at the file system.
[2:36:31.840 --> 2:36:35.840]  We are looking at a projection of data.
[2:36:35.840 --> 2:36:38.840]  Just as if you pulled up the photo picker,
[2:36:38.840 --> 2:36:41.840]  you don't think about the files.
[2:36:41.840 --> 2:36:43.840]  You think about the photos you've got.
[2:36:43.840 --> 2:36:46.840]  And I think that this is the better way for it.
[2:36:46.840 --> 2:36:48.840]  And it's not confusing. It might be limiting.
[2:36:48.840 --> 2:36:49.840]  It still is limiting.
[2:36:49.840 --> 2:36:53.840]  And until the document picker, it was definitely limiting.
[2:36:53.840 --> 2:36:56.840]  Because to open the same image on iOS,
[2:36:56.840 --> 2:36:58.840]  it was in your camera roll.
[2:36:58.840 --> 2:37:01.840]  To open it in after light or VSCO cam,
[2:37:01.840 --> 2:37:04.840]  you would make a copy of it and import it into their thing.
[2:37:04.840 --> 2:37:05.840]  And then they would open it.
[2:37:05.840 --> 2:37:06.840]  And then if you wanted to save it back out,
[2:37:06.840 --> 2:37:09.840]  you'd have to save a new copy back to the photo roll.
[2:37:09.840 --> 2:37:10.840]  So you've got three copies now.
[2:37:10.840 --> 2:37:11.840]  You're original.
[2:37:11.840 --> 2:37:15.840]  The one in VSCO cam and the one that was the filtered version
[2:37:15.840 --> 2:37:17.840]  and saved back to your camera roll.
[2:37:17.840 --> 2:37:18.840]  Obviously inefficient.
[2:37:18.840 --> 2:37:21.840]  But it didn't, you know, it was inefficient,
[2:37:21.840 --> 2:37:24.840]  but it didn't, you know, at least protected people
[2:37:24.840 --> 2:37:26.840]  from blowing their photos apart.
[2:37:26.840 --> 2:37:27.840]  Right.
[2:37:27.840 --> 2:37:29.840]  And the new way, you know, is better.
[2:37:29.840 --> 2:37:32.840]  It's way cooler that you can just open it right up in VSCO cam
[2:37:32.840 --> 2:37:35.840]  and it saves right back to the same camera roll.
[2:37:35.840 --> 2:37:37.840]  You know, it's great.
[2:37:37.840 --> 2:37:45.840]  But it was, that's the ultimate goal all along.
[2:37:45.840 --> 2:37:48.840]  The whole idea that users are not going to have direct access
[2:37:48.840 --> 2:37:51.840]  to the file system because so many things could go bad.
[2:37:51.840 --> 2:37:54.840]  And to me, the most telltale sign that the file name extensions
[2:37:54.840 --> 2:37:57.840]  were a bad idea in the Mac was that they immediately defaulted
[2:37:57.840 --> 2:37:59.840]  to hiding them.
[2:37:59.840 --> 2:38:00.840]  Yeah.
[2:38:00.840 --> 2:38:02.840]  And was that in 10.0?
[2:38:02.840 --> 2:38:04.840]  I mean, it came pretty quick.
[2:38:04.840 --> 2:38:06.840]  I think it was in 10.0 where the file name extensions
[2:38:06.840 --> 2:38:07.840]  were hidden.
[2:38:07.840 --> 2:38:10.840]  And it made people so confused because on the old Mac,
[2:38:10.840 --> 2:38:18.840]  in classic Mac OS, if you had a file named portrait.jpg,
[2:38:18.840 --> 2:38:20.840]  you didn't have to have the.jpg.
[2:38:20.840 --> 2:38:22.840]  So you could just, you didn't need the file extension.
[2:38:22.840 --> 2:38:24.840]  It could be a JPEG, but it would just be named portrait.
[2:38:24.840 --> 2:38:25.840]  Right.
[2:38:25.840 --> 2:38:27.840]  And if you had another file and you wanted to convert it
[2:38:27.840 --> 2:38:30.840]  to a different format, like painting or something like that,
[2:38:30.840 --> 2:38:31.840]  you couldn't give it the same name.
[2:38:31.840 --> 2:38:34.840]  You couldn't have two files named portrait in the same folder
[2:38:34.840 --> 2:38:36.840]  because it's files.
[2:38:36.840 --> 2:38:39.840]  Whereas all of a sudden in Mac OS 10, you could have portrait.jpg
[2:38:39.840 --> 2:38:41.840]  and portrait.png in the same folder.
[2:38:41.840 --> 2:38:44.840]  And they both said portrait and they both look like the same image.
[2:38:44.840 --> 2:38:47.840]  And because the file extension is hidden, you can't tell,
[2:38:47.840 --> 2:38:48.840]  which is, yes.
[2:38:48.840 --> 2:38:49.840]  Right.
[2:38:49.840 --> 2:38:51.840]  So you're just talking yourself in circles when you start saying
[2:38:51.840 --> 2:38:54.840]  that we can do it and then to avoid the confusion will hide it
[2:38:54.840 --> 2:38:58.840]  and the hiding things is never the right idea.
[2:38:58.840 --> 2:39:00.840]  So I agree with you.
[2:39:00.840 --> 2:39:01.840]  And I did at the time.
[2:39:01.840 --> 2:39:04.840]  I just think it's a pragmatic solution.
[2:39:04.840 --> 2:39:05.840]  Right.
[2:39:05.840 --> 2:39:08.840]  But you know, the truth is the reason I'll say that it was,
[2:39:08.840 --> 2:39:11.840]  we're all, we're just fighting over which ways to be wrong
[2:39:11.840 --> 2:39:13.840]  because Mac users shot themselves in the foot.
[2:39:13.840 --> 2:39:16.840]  Check Mac users shot themselves in the foot with a file system too.
[2:39:16.840 --> 2:39:19.840]  They just did it in different ways than Unix and Windows users.
[2:39:19.840 --> 2:39:27.840]  I just, I, I feel that there is as yet an unsolved problem here.
[2:39:27.840 --> 2:39:32.840]  But I don't think exposing file systems is the way to go.
[2:39:32.840 --> 2:39:33.840]  Basically.
[2:39:33.840 --> 2:39:33.840]  No.
[2:39:33.840 --> 2:39:34.840]  No.
[2:39:34.840 --> 2:39:35.840]  It's a developer.
[2:39:35.840 --> 2:39:37.840]  The file system is a developer level.
[2:39:37.840 --> 2:39:38.840]  Yeah.
[2:39:38.840 --> 2:39:39.840]  Yeah.
[2:39:39.840 --> 2:39:40.840]  Anything else?
[2:39:40.840 --> 2:39:41.840]  We should wrap up.
[2:39:41.840 --> 2:39:42.840]  I'm kind of bored of you.
[2:39:42.840 --> 2:39:43.840]  Yeah, me too.
[2:39:43.840 --> 2:39:45.840]  Good thing we're running into each other in three days.
[2:39:45.840 --> 2:39:46.840]  I know.
[2:39:46.840 --> 2:39:47.840]  Yeah.
[2:39:47.840 --> 2:39:49.840]  It's going to be a good weekend.
[2:39:49.840 --> 2:39:52.840]  Well, at least we got all the nerd talk out of the way.
[2:39:52.840 --> 2:39:53.840]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:39:53.840 --> 2:39:55.840]  Let me, let's give a big,
[2:39:55.840 --> 2:40:00.840]  uh, pitch to the podcast because you're doing amazing, amazing work.
[2:40:00.840 --> 2:40:03.840]  That you've dropped a couple of references to it, but you've got a series.
[2:40:03.840 --> 2:40:05.840]  And this is on debug.
[2:40:05.840 --> 2:40:06.840]  Debug.
[2:40:06.840 --> 2:40:07.840]  Debug.
[2:40:07.840 --> 2:40:07.840]  Yeah.
[2:40:07.840 --> 2:40:09.840]  Where you've got Nitten.
[2:40:09.840 --> 2:40:10.840]  Uh,
[2:40:10.840 --> 2:40:11.840]  even Gennatra.
[2:40:11.840 --> 2:40:12.840]  Needen Gennatra.
[2:40:12.840 --> 2:40:13.840]  Don Melton.
[2:40:13.840 --> 2:40:14.840]  Don Melton.
[2:40:14.840 --> 2:40:15.840]  Don Melton.
[2:40:15.840 --> 2:40:16.840]  Don Melton, you guys might know.
[2:40:16.840 --> 2:40:18.840]  He's, he's left Apple recently.
[2:40:18.840 --> 2:40:21.840]  He was the head of, uh, the web kit in Safari.
[2:40:21.840 --> 2:40:24.840]  Uh, and adds, you know, super colorful history.
[2:40:24.840 --> 2:40:28.840]  In the industry and one of the best storytellers I've ever heard.
[2:40:28.840 --> 2:40:29.840]  Um,
[2:40:29.840 --> 2:40:34.840]  And this is an epic epic podcast that you guys have recorded with him.
[2:40:34.840 --> 2:40:37.840]  If part one was two hours and you just did a part two yesterday.
[2:40:37.840 --> 2:40:38.840]  I, yeah.
[2:40:38.840 --> 2:40:43.840]  So I mean, we sat down with Nitten, uh, in June.
[2:40:43.840 --> 2:40:48.840]  And I was, as every podcast, I'm like, man,
[2:40:48.840 --> 2:40:51.840]  am I going to get an hour after this interview?
[2:40:51.840 --> 2:40:52.840]  I don't know if you do.
[2:40:52.840 --> 2:40:55.840]  Like, do you ever do the cold interview where you're like,
[2:40:55.840 --> 2:40:57.840]  I hope I get an hour out of this.
[2:40:57.840 --> 2:41:00.840]  And then it's, forget it, it ran.
[2:41:00.840 --> 2:41:03.840]  And so we had like three episodes with Nitten,
[2:41:03.840 --> 2:41:07.840]  totaling over six hours, which is horrible.
[2:41:07.840 --> 2:41:10.840]  Uh, and then we put, uh, Don Melton and, uh,
[2:41:10.840 --> 2:41:12.840]  Nitten together in Gennatra together.
[2:41:12.840 --> 2:41:16.840]  And we had another two hours, two hour episode,
[2:41:16.840 --> 2:41:19.840]  and we just recorded another two hours yesterday.
[2:41:19.840 --> 2:41:22.840]  Right. And Nitten's a guy who's, you know, it's again,
[2:41:22.840 --> 2:41:25.840]  you don't want to make assumptions about how things work inside Apple.
[2:41:25.840 --> 2:41:28.840]  But like you said, he, at one point, he was the head of iOS apps.
[2:41:28.840 --> 2:41:29.840]  Right. What the,
[2:41:29.840 --> 2:41:35.840]  he literally came up from working on all kinds of old school Apple stuff.
[2:41:35.840 --> 2:41:38.840]  Right. Like you're doing carbon through the carbon file manager,
[2:41:38.840 --> 2:41:42.840]  like seriously low level carbon stuff, like the carbon file manager.
[2:41:42.840 --> 2:41:44.840]  He's, he's, he's, he's brilliant.
[2:41:44.840 --> 2:41:47.840]  We may cut this out of the show, but they've both been at,
[2:41:47.840 --> 2:41:52.840]  like the same top 100 meeting at Apple.
[2:41:52.840 --> 2:41:56.840]  Right. Right. And, you know,
[2:41:56.840 --> 2:41:59.840]  if you want to hear some other people speak about Apple.
[2:41:59.840 --> 2:42:00.840]  Yeah. I,
[2:42:00.840 --> 2:42:02.840]  And little bit more freely than you're used to,
[2:42:02.840 --> 2:42:03.840]  because they're not at Apple anymore.
[2:42:03.840 --> 2:42:04.840]  They're not at Apple.
[2:42:04.840 --> 2:42:07.840]  And, you know, Renee, and especially Renee,
[2:42:07.840 --> 2:42:10.840]  but myself too, we,
[2:42:10.840 --> 2:42:14.840]  we afford them a place where they can just speak freely
[2:42:14.840 --> 2:42:17.840]  and we'll cut anything in retrospect.
[2:42:17.840 --> 2:42:19.840]  They, they may not want to say it back.
[2:42:19.840 --> 2:42:20.840]  So that's it.
[2:42:20.840 --> 2:42:23.840]  The, the, the debug podcast is,
[2:42:23.840 --> 2:42:25.840]  Yeah. I'm more than a bomb slash debug.
[2:42:25.840 --> 2:42:27.840]  Yeah. I'm more than a dot com slash debug.
[2:42:27.840 --> 2:42:30.840]  And that's, that's like the only project that I'm willing
[2:42:30.840 --> 2:42:33.840]  to really plug because it's got very little to do with me
[2:42:33.840 --> 2:42:36.840]  and has like the guests are amazing.
[2:42:36.840 --> 2:42:39.840]  Okay. I was going to give you a vector too,
[2:42:39.840 --> 2:42:40.840]  but if you just want to.
[2:42:40.840 --> 2:42:41.840]  Yeah. If you want to do vector,
[2:42:41.840 --> 2:42:44.840]  that's, that's, that's for you.
[2:42:44.840 --> 2:42:47.840]  I'll keep quiet with that whiskers on that too.
[2:42:47.840 --> 2:42:49.840]  Oh, Izzy, what's the one that whiskers is on?
[2:42:49.840 --> 2:42:53.840]  What's the one that Jesse Charlie was recently on?
[2:42:53.840 --> 2:42:54.840]  Uh, vector.
[2:42:54.840 --> 2:42:55.840]  Oh, did you like that one?
[2:42:55.840 --> 2:42:56.840]  I like that one.
[2:42:56.840 --> 2:42:58.840]  Yeah, but I was whiskers on that one.
[2:42:58.840 --> 2:43:00.840]  No, he, he stepped out and Jesse stepped in.
[2:43:00.840 --> 2:43:02.840]  Uh, we just did that.
[2:43:02.840 --> 2:43:03.840]  Maybe that's why I like that.
[2:43:03.840 --> 2:43:04.840]  Maybe that's very like that one.
[2:43:04.840 --> 2:43:05.840]  Guess what?
[2:43:05.840 --> 2:43:06.840]  You're going to like the next one.
[2:43:06.840 --> 2:43:08.840]  Uh, whiskers is also a way.
[2:43:08.840 --> 2:43:11.840]  And hey, Dave, please edit this constantly.
[2:43:11.840 --> 2:43:13.840]  I know you're listening.
[2:43:13.840 --> 2:43:14.840]  Love you, buddy.
[2:43:14.840 --> 2:43:16.840]  Um, the worst part is he cut in.
[2:43:16.840 --> 2:43:17.840]  He's got the final.
[2:43:17.840 --> 2:43:20.840]  I know he can actually just jump in here.
[2:43:22.840 --> 2:43:25.840]  And that's also I'm more calm slash vector.
[2:43:25.840 --> 2:43:28.840]  I mean, more this, this week is Christina Warren,
[2:43:28.840 --> 2:43:30.840]  who guess what?
[2:43:30.840 --> 2:43:31.840]  Kind of smart.
[2:43:31.840 --> 2:43:32.840]  Yeah, very smart.
[2:43:32.840 --> 2:43:35.840]  She's a matchable, I believe.
[2:43:35.840 --> 2:43:36.840]  Right.
[2:43:36.840 --> 2:43:40.840]  Probably best known to readers from, uh, her bylines at, uh,
[2:43:40.840 --> 2:43:41.840]  Mashable.
[2:43:41.840 --> 2:43:42.840]  Yeah.
[2:43:42.840 --> 2:43:43.840]  Yeah.
[2:43:43.840 --> 2:43:44.840]  Where I just saw her recently.
[2:43:44.840 --> 2:43:45.840]  Where did I see her?
[2:43:45.840 --> 2:43:46.840]  The event, I guess.
[2:43:46.840 --> 2:43:47.840]  I don't know.
[2:43:47.840 --> 2:43:48.840]  Yeah.
[2:43:48.840 --> 2:43:49.840]  I saw somewhere else.
[2:43:49.840 --> 2:43:50.840]  But anyway, yeah.
[2:43:50.840 --> 2:43:51.840]  Very, very smart.
[2:43:51.840 --> 2:43:53.840]  I believe he comes around.
[2:43:53.840 --> 2:43:54.840]  Chew.
[2:43:54.840 --> 2:43:56.840]  Yeah, she'll be, uh, she'll be here this weekend.
[2:43:56.840 --> 2:43:57.840]  Yeah.
[2:43:57.840 --> 2:43:58.840]  There you go.
[2:43:58.840 --> 2:44:02.840]  Uh, well, two great podcasts that you host regularly and have
[2:44:02.840 --> 2:44:04.840]  both of them have been on fire recently.
[2:44:04.840 --> 2:44:08.840]  Anybody, uh, looking for more podcasts and role on these lines.
[2:44:08.840 --> 2:44:09.840]  Boy, I can't recommend those enough.
[2:44:09.840 --> 2:44:12.840]  And the debug ones are classic.
[2:44:12.840 --> 2:44:13.840]  Seriously.
[2:44:13.840 --> 2:44:15.840]  I mean, I think that I don't mean to butter your toast to your
[2:44:15.840 --> 2:44:16.840]  guy.
[2:44:16.840 --> 2:44:19.840]  But honestly, I think they're, they're up there with some of the,
[2:44:19.840 --> 2:44:22.840]  you know, the Andy Hertzfeld stuff in terms of, you know,
[2:44:22.840 --> 2:44:25.840]  get those transcribed because 15, 20 years from now,
[2:44:25.840 --> 2:44:28.840]  that's, that's good stuff that's largely been
[2:44:28.840 --> 2:44:29.840]  undocumented.
[2:44:29.840 --> 2:44:34.840]  We transcribed all of them and we may be putting a,
[2:44:34.840 --> 2:44:36.840]  a collection at some point.
[2:44:36.840 --> 2:44:37.840]  Right.
[2:44:37.840 --> 2:44:39.840]  Cause, you know, these stories are largely untold.
[2:44:39.840 --> 2:44:43.840]  And some of them are told, but only like privately, but, you
[2:44:43.840 --> 2:44:45.840]  know, they're not again, it's not like they're burning bridges.
[2:44:45.840 --> 2:44:47.840]  They're not spilling state secrets.
[2:44:47.840 --> 2:44:49.840]  But no, it's often it's years old stuff.
[2:44:49.840 --> 2:44:55.840]  But there's so much context and so much, uh, I think you,
[2:44:55.840 --> 2:44:57.840]  you start to understand the culture a lot more.
[2:44:57.840 --> 2:44:58.840]  Yeah.
[2:44:58.840 --> 2:44:59.840]  Yeah.
[2:44:59.840 --> 2:45:00.840]  No, you definitely do.
[2:45:00.840 --> 2:45:02.840]  And it's a great place to start.
[2:45:02.840 --> 2:45:03.840]  Thanks.
[2:45:03.840 --> 2:45:06.840]  And again, that's not me.
[2:45:06.840 --> 2:45:09.840]  We really just set the stage and we have some great people tell
[2:45:09.840 --> 2:45:10.840]  some great stories.
[2:45:10.840 --> 2:45:11.840]  Yeah.
[2:45:11.840 --> 2:45:12.840]  All right.
[2:45:12.840 --> 2:45:14.840]  Guy English, I will see you soon.
[2:45:14.840 --> 2:45:15.840]  Yeah.
[2:45:15.840 --> 2:45:16.840]  Yeah.
[2:45:16.840 --> 2:45:17.840]  This weekend.
[2:45:17.840 --> 2:45:36.840]  Anyway, I have to like her better.
