[00:00.000 --> 00:07.840]  Ah, Jason Snell, it is. It's good to have you back. It's good to be back.
[00:07.840 --> 00:12.680]  Uh, baseball. I don't know when. We were on fairly recently at the end of last year, but
[00:12.680 --> 00:16.360]  you know, baseball, we got baseball. It's the, you know, it's March.
[00:16.360 --> 00:20.160]  I know this. I got good news for talk show listeners. The next two hours, it's all about
[00:20.160 --> 00:25.060]  keyboards and baseball. How the giant movies in there too. How the
[00:25.060 --> 00:30.400]  giant's looking this year? Uh, giants are looking, you know, Hope Springs Eternal. It's
[00:30.400 --> 00:34.560]  a funny thing. Um, they had, they almost lost a hundred games last year, although they were
[00:34.560 --> 00:42.420]  projected to win like 80 or 85. So it was just a cascade of disasters, um, starting
[00:42.420 --> 00:48.280]  with Madison Bumgarner taking a ride on a, on a motorbike and, and separating his shoulder.
[00:48.280 --> 00:51.880]  But, uh, they were projected to bounce back and then they made a couple of moves in the
[00:51.880 --> 00:57.960]  off season, um, trying to stay under the salary tax this year, which, um, I think is really
[00:57.960 --> 01:01.840]  encouraging because it means they actually intend to spend money next year, uh, which
[01:01.840 --> 01:08.200]  is why you'd want to stay under for this year. And you know, they, they are in true, I think,
[01:08.200 --> 01:12.320]  Moneyball fashion. They're trying to find a hole in the market where people are undervalued
[01:12.320 --> 01:16.280]  and in typical giants fashion, it's people in their early thirties who are considered
[01:16.280 --> 01:21.560]  over the hill by baseball standards. So any off season where you get the definitive player
[01:21.560 --> 01:26.020]  of two different franchises traded to you by those franchises, it's gotta be a pretty
[01:26.020 --> 01:30.960]  good off season. So Evan Longoria and Andrew McCutcheon. Um, so you know, they might be
[01:30.960 --> 01:34.600]  okay. I'm hoping that they're entertaining. The problem last year was not that they were
[01:34.600 --> 01:38.840]  losers. It was just, they were terrible. Like they were unwatchable to the point where in
[01:38.840 --> 01:43.840]  June I just, I actually said to myself, I got to pick another team. I got to like pick
[01:43.840 --> 01:49.400]  a team whose games I can put on the TV to see good baseball because the giants weren't
[01:49.400 --> 01:53.000]  providing it. And so in the middle of June, I just picked the Astros cause they were having
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.480]  a really good year and I was on that bandwagon early and I wrote it all the way to the end.
[01:57.480 --> 02:03.140]  So that was pretty sweet. Uh, that sounds pretty good. Um, I am very happy. He's going
[02:03.140 --> 02:07.840]  to be okay. I've been hitting home runs this year. I don't know. I hope, I hope so. You
[02:07.840 --> 02:10.880]  know that the leading home run hitter in the preseason isn't even a guy you've heard of.
[02:10.880 --> 02:15.880]  It's this kid and a horror hit two and one is like five and three games or something.
[02:15.880 --> 02:19.360]  That's crazy. Pre, preseason games that don't count. I mean like if you're a pitcher in
[02:19.360 --> 02:22.840]  spring training, they're not even trying to get guys out there. Just like, let me try
[02:22.840 --> 02:27.720]  this pitch. I'll try that one again. And it's like the games are there to, I guess, you
[02:27.720 --> 02:31.360]  know, provide some structure and sell some tickets because of course spring training
[02:31.360 --> 02:36.240]  is a big moneymaker for all the teams. But yeah, my mom gets excited. My mom loves, football
[02:36.240 --> 02:40.440]  loves the NFL and she gets excited every time there's a preseason football games are on.
[02:40.440 --> 02:43.560]  She's like, Oh, did you see this? And you see that? It's like, I don't, I mean, I don't
[02:43.560 --> 02:47.080]  care that much about football, but I really don't care about football games that don't
[02:47.080 --> 02:50.240]  count that are largely played by people who are not going to be on the team. It's like
[02:50.240 --> 02:55.880]  I literally could not care about that if I tried and spring training baseball is a little
[02:55.880 --> 02:59.880]  bit better than that because I like baseball more, but it's also kind of not important.
[02:59.880 --> 03:03.140]  It's just, I'm glad it's there and they're getting, they're stretching everything out
[03:03.140 --> 03:09.280]  and getting ready to, to work hard in April. I think, I think that I don't want God won't
[03:09.280 --> 03:14.600]  go along with baseball, but I do think that the next one of the next levels of money ball
[03:14.600 --> 03:20.400]  is sort of going back old school where you, you, you maybe look at the numbers first,
[03:20.400 --> 03:26.120]  but then you look at the type of player and you're not just looking at numbers and I look
[03:26.120 --> 03:31.580]  at the giants and I see signing guys like McCutcheon and Longoria, it's more than just
[03:31.580 --> 03:38.960]  that they're sort of 30 young, 30 ish past their prime, but franchise players from before.
[03:38.960 --> 03:42.540]  These are guys who like led the team, led the communities. You know, I mean like these
[03:42.540 --> 03:49.360]  are guys who are really well known for, you know, doing everything you would want a athletic
[03:49.360 --> 03:56.160]  role model to do, you know? Yeah, I, I think what people will misunderstand about money
[03:56.160 --> 04:01.520]  ball is like when money ball was written by Michael Lewis, it's great book. Um, they,
[04:01.520 --> 04:05.640]  they said, Oh, okay, money ball is look for people with good on base percentages. And
[04:05.640 --> 04:10.880]  then everybody did that. And these days, everybody, every front office in baseball is full of
[04:10.880 --> 04:15.840]  mostly Ivy league trained people with kind of economics degrees who are into the stats
[04:15.840 --> 04:19.800]  and all of that. But money ball was never about that. Money ball was always about if
[04:19.800 --> 04:26.140]  you're the Oakland A's and you don't have money, how do you find an edge, any edge?
[04:26.140 --> 04:31.920]  And I think what we, what we're in this world where the, the stats guys really do reign
[04:31.920 --> 04:35.760]  supreme and it's been shown that what they do works. If you look at the Cubs and the
[04:35.760 --> 04:40.200]  Astros, it's totally what works. Well, it doesn't mean that there aren't still things
[04:40.200 --> 04:46.120]  that are undervalued out there and knowing that a baseball player hits its peak on average
[04:46.120 --> 04:51.800]  at 28 years old. Um, yeah, you can make an argument, a contrarian argument, like maybe
[04:51.800 --> 04:57.680]  a getting, picking up a guy who's 32 or 31. No, he's yes, he's on the downward slide,
[04:57.680 --> 05:03.000]  but maybe everybody else is not giving him enough credit. And that's, so I think that's
[05:03.000 --> 05:08.760]  exciting that, you know, things that we consider intangible, like, oh, you know, is he a good
[05:08.760 --> 05:13.560]  clubhouse guy, things like that, that you always would roll your eyes about. You know,
[05:13.560 --> 05:18.280]  there probably is truth to that because these are people, they aren't numbers. And, uh,
[05:18.280 --> 05:22.280]  and so, yeah, I think that's one of the interesting things is if everybody's got the numbers and
[05:22.280 --> 05:25.720]  all the smart math guys are cranking out all the numbers, you're going to get your edge
[05:25.720 --> 05:31.200]  somewhere else. Cause like if, if literally like the Astros math is not better than the
[05:31.200 --> 05:37.200]  Cubs math, right? I mean, maybe they have some techniques that they're using, but like
[05:37.200 --> 05:41.800]  that battle is kind of over. Everybody's, everybody's being smart about stats. So you're,
[05:41.800 --> 05:46.720]  you're going to find an angle somewhere else. Did you see the five 38 piece last week? I
[05:46.720 --> 05:51.040]  forgot to, I can't believe I didn't link to this on during fireball, but they, uh, this
[05:51.040 --> 05:57.920]  argument about the, have the baseball's been juiced since midway through 2015. Um, yeah.
[05:57.920 --> 06:02.400]  And they took them to some places like Caltech or some university with like a super high
[06:02.400 --> 06:11.680]  res CT scan. And the answer is yes, the rubber, uh, that's around the core is like a different
[06:11.680 --> 06:17.040]  material or something. And that that's enough. Yeah. Yeah. It's enough that the math says
[06:17.040 --> 06:23.680]  it would give it maybe like, I forget, like an extra six inches. And then there's another
[06:23.680 --> 06:27.920]  factor because of the weight. The weight is it's like a 10th of an ounce lighter. And
[06:27.920 --> 06:32.960]  that, that combined with the material change would give you like the percentage increase
[06:32.960 --> 06:37.440]  in home runs we've seen since 2015. I'm going to bring it around to something that, and
[06:37.440 --> 06:41.320]  for people who haven't skipped to the next chapter to, to something related to Apple,
[06:41.320 --> 06:46.200]  which is manufacturing, it shows you that at volume or when you've got very specific
[06:46.200 --> 06:51.000]  things that you have to do, like at a very small microscopic, almost levels of materials,
[06:51.000 --> 06:53.960]  you can make a change. Cause I don't think this is a conspiracy. I don't think major
[06:53.960 --> 06:57.120]  league baseball was like, let's change the baseball to juice it. Like literally it's
[06:57.120 --> 07:02.520]  probably like a supplier changed what their rubber formula was. And that happens to be
[07:02.520 --> 07:07.760]  the rubber that was in a new batch that came to the factory in Guatemala or wherever it
[07:07.760 --> 07:13.280]  is somewhere in central America where they make these. And that's what they used. And
[07:13.280 --> 07:18.420]  they have a whole big truck of it and it completely changed the game of baseball. And it's amazing
[07:18.420 --> 07:23.780]  to think of a multi-billion dollar, hundreds of billions of dollar industry that gets changed
[07:23.780 --> 07:29.360]  by something that small, but you know, it could be, you know, the Apple stuff, it's
[07:29.360 --> 07:33.520]  the same way, whether it's the silicone on the bottom of a home pod or whether it's a
[07:33.520 --> 07:40.680]  compo, a tiny component in an iPhone, like a little thing in manufacturing can make a
[07:40.680 --> 07:45.400]  huge difference in the end product, even though on its own, it's, it's almost meaningless
[07:45.400 --> 07:51.120]  or it seems meaningless. Yeah. But it is very consistent though. It's like all the baseballs
[07:51.120 --> 07:55.120]  after midway through that season and none of the baseballs from before it, you know,
[07:55.120 --> 08:00.120]  there's a definite difference. They're all the same, right? Like it's a totally turnkey
[08:00.120 --> 08:05.560]  kind of process, right? It's just that one of the inputs changed an imperceptible amount
[08:05.560 --> 08:11.040]  and it wasn't for, you know, a year or more until people realized quite what it, what
[08:11.040 --> 08:14.140]  had happened. And I don't know how you prevent that. Like if you're baseball and you're,
[08:14.140 --> 08:19.800]  and you're doing like gas chromatographs of the elements of a baseball every week and
[08:19.800 --> 08:26.560]  you see that it's changed, I mean, they can't stop making baseballs. What do they do? I
[08:26.560 --> 08:32.880]  don't even know if there is something to solve that problem. Anyway, we better follow up.
[08:32.880 --> 08:36.760]  All right. Totally new topic. I'm telling you this is about as different as a topic
[08:36.760 --> 08:41.320]  as you're going to get from baseball manufacturing is Marco was on my show last time. We had
[08:41.320 --> 08:47.600]  a, uh, went a little long, I guess we covered a lot of topics. Um, and at one point we were
[08:47.600 --> 08:53.400]  talking about making coffee and it came up briefly, uh, you know, about, uh, Marco had
[08:53.400 --> 09:00.240]  switched from a, uh, oven, a stove top kettle to a electric kettle. And I, I proudly said,
[09:00.240 --> 09:04.640]  I still like, I, I just, I still like stove top kettle. I'll tell you what, our friends
[09:04.640 --> 09:10.440]  in Europe, our listeners in Europe have some very strong feelings about whether or not
[09:10.440 --> 09:14.960]  every single kitchen should have an electric kettle. Well, their electricity is better
[09:14.960 --> 09:19.520]  than ours though. They can boil water and electric kettle twice as fast as we can. Electric
[09:19.520 --> 09:27.080]  is so weak. They've got 240 volts and we've, we've got one, one 20. Uh, ah, it's sometimes
[09:27.080 --> 09:32.520]  you know, you're, you're stepping into a minefield. Uh, I later on on this show, I want to talk
[09:32.520 --> 09:38.760]  a little bit about the, uh, NRA TV channel on Apple TV. I'm, I'm anticipating I'm, I'm
[09:38.760 --> 09:42.320]  approaching it with eggshells. I'm approaching, I'm anticipating that people might have strong
[09:42.320 --> 09:50.080]  feelings really had no, no, no idea that my disregard for electric kettles was going to
[09:50.080 --> 09:57.280]  anger so many listeners. Oh my God. And then the people saying that the, the, the espresso
[09:57.280 --> 10:02.680]  people, Oh my God, don't even get me started on them. I mean, God bless you. I don't know.
[10:02.680 --> 10:06.580]  I feel like there's some kind of combination between they're having a very strong preference
[10:06.580 --> 10:14.720]  for espresso and they're drinking too much espresso and thereby being easily angered.
[10:14.720 --> 10:18.920]  But I'll tell you what, there are some people who feel that anything other than the espresso
[10:18.920 --> 10:26.040]  is not really good coffee and that nothing made in North America is good espresso. So
[10:26.040 --> 10:34.320]  my apologies. Wow. I, I don't drink coffee. I am a tea drinker, so I, so I owned, so I
[10:34.320 --> 10:38.960]  own two electric kettles, but, but I don't understand. I'm just completely neutral on
[10:38.960 --> 10:45.040]  the coffee thing. It doesn't, I don't understand it. So that's good. It's a good place to be.
[10:45.040 --> 10:53.000]  Um, anyway, uh, I wanted to say this. There's two apps, uh, scripted bugger seven just shipped
[10:53.000 --> 10:59.320]  the other day. That's from late night software, longtime developer, Mark Aldret. Um, and then
[10:59.320 --> 11:07.200]  within the last year, BB edit 12 shipped from barebone software. Um, um, and uh, co-founded
[11:07.200 --> 11:13.760]  by rich Siegel and Patrick Wolsey. I used to, used to work for those guys. Um, and I
[11:13.760 --> 11:17.240]  still use those apps all the time. I can't say I use script a bugger every day because
[11:17.240 --> 11:21.800]  I don't write Apple scripts or edit Apple scripts every day, but every time that I have
[11:21.800 --> 11:26.520]  either created a new Apple script or futzed with an old one for as long as I can remember,
[11:26.520 --> 11:31.240]  it's been with script a bugger. Um, cause it's just a fantastic app and it's so much
[11:31.240 --> 11:37.840]  better than the Apple's built in script editor and, and the name of the app is exactly why
[11:37.840 --> 11:43.800]  it's better. Yeah. Yeah. Cause it has actual debugging tools. I used script bugger for
[11:43.800 --> 11:49.320]  a long time when I was doing some complicated scripts when I was at IDG and then at some
[11:49.320 --> 11:53.400]  point I stopped working on the scripts and they came out with a new version and I didn't
[11:53.400 --> 11:57.760]  update and that was about when the script editor got better and I just went back to
[11:57.760 --> 12:01.480]  the script editor because I thought, well, I don't really need the heavy lifting stuff,
[12:01.480 --> 12:06.200]  but script a bugger seven came out and he pointed it out that like it's, you can use
[12:06.200 --> 12:10.240]  it for free, like BB edit, like there's a free tier where you can just use it. And even
[12:10.240 --> 12:15.280]  at the free level, it's way better than the script editor and it had its, uh, the anticipated
[12:15.280 --> 12:19.800]  effect. I think what, what he's hoping he gets out of it, which is that, um, I used
[12:19.800 --> 12:24.160]  it for like 10 minutes and I was like, Oh right. And I just bought it because it's so
[12:24.160 --> 12:28.880]  much better that I just, I'd never want to bother. And also I don't have any faith that
[12:28.880 --> 12:34.480]  the script editor is being updated by Apple at all ever again. So, um, I'd rather have
[12:34.480 --> 12:40.280]  a, uh, an app from somebody who actually cares about it. I, you know what, the Apple script
[12:40.280 --> 12:46.280]  stuff within Apple is, uh, I would love to get the full story someday because it, and
[12:46.280 --> 12:49.720]  the one hand you want to say, boy, this feels like something that might be on the way out
[12:49.720 --> 12:53.920]  and it never seemed to get anywhere. And even when it was getting some love, it was never
[12:53.920 --> 12:59.760]  getting as much love as like you and I and, and other serious, you know, for lack of a
[12:59.760 --> 13:04.960]  better term, I sometimes cringe using it, but Mac power users would like, but it was,
[13:04.960 --> 13:09.840]  but then it seemingly took a turn for the worst last year. And Sal, a long time leader
[13:09.840 --> 13:14.640]  of the automation team, you know, with an Apple left, doesn't seem like it was on good
[13:14.640 --> 13:19.360]  terms. Um, and, and like you said, like script editor, it doesn't seem like it's getting
[13:19.360 --> 13:24.040]  a lot of updates. Uh, only thing I can remember it getting in recent years was when they updated
[13:24.040 --> 13:31.920]  it to support the JavaScript, um, for automation, which is using JavaScript as the language
[13:31.920 --> 13:36.340]  to control the same underlying automation stuff that Apple script drives. But then the
[13:36.340 --> 13:42.640]  fact that that JavaScript for automation exists at all is sort of proof that there is engineering
[13:42.640 --> 13:48.860]  going on there. Yeah, it's, it's a weird situation. I'm, I'm actually okay with the idea that
[13:48.860 --> 13:54.720]  Apple, um, you know, if Apple says, look, Apple script was a great idea, but it's old
[13:54.720 --> 13:59.080]  and it's sort of not how people work today and we want to replace it with something better.
[13:59.080 --> 14:03.920]  I would go along with that. I just am not entirely convinced. I'm not at all convinced
[14:03.920 --> 14:08.680]  that we want to replace it with something better is a thing that exists and that that's
[14:08.680 --> 14:13.580]  the thing is like, I'm okay with Apple throwing away Apple script. I really am. As long as
[14:13.580 --> 14:20.500]  they replace it with some great, preferably cross-platform iOS and Mac OS automation system
[14:20.500 --> 14:27.800]  that is modern and is a, you know, 2018 take on what, uh, inter app communication and control
[14:27.800 --> 14:33.160]  and system scripting should be. But they've shown, um, I mean, short of, uh, other than
[14:33.160 --> 14:36.720]  buying workflow, which we've known nothing about other than that, they keep working on
[14:36.720 --> 14:42.960]  the workflow iOS app. That's the closest sign we've had in a long time that Apple has any
[14:42.960 --> 14:48.240]  interest in like user automation. So, uh, you know, I, I'm willing to say, okay, fine.
[14:48.240 --> 14:52.620]  Apple script had a good run and it's over, but I'm going to hold onto it, uh, like for
[14:52.620 --> 14:58.440]  dear life until Apple has an alternative and, and I, I wouldn't put money down on that.
[14:58.440 --> 15:03.360]  I wouldn't either. But then there's things like, like the Apple notes app, um, which
[15:03.360 --> 15:07.980]  was rewritten recently, I don't know, maybe not rewritten from scratch, but it's felt
[15:07.980 --> 15:16.000]  like when they switched to iCloud, uh, uh, uh, cloud kit for the sinking, uh, instead
[15:16.000 --> 15:23.720]  of the goofy IMAP, uh, that it felt like a new app. I don't know, but I, I was, I dragged
[15:23.720 --> 15:27.840]  it onto the script debugger to see if it has a dictionary. And I was half expecting a,
[15:27.840 --> 15:34.140]  this app isn't scriptable. Um, and it said, no, low. It has a very rich scripting dictionary,
[15:34.140 --> 15:38.400]  more than just the basics. Uh, so I don't know, maybe that script, that note scripting
[15:38.400 --> 15:41.780]  dictionary has been there for a long time and I just never knew it cause I didn't trust
[15:41.780 --> 15:47.200]  notes cause of the IMAP sinking never worked. But, uh, I don't know. And then there's other
[15:47.200 --> 15:52.460]  weird recent, not weird, but, uh, things that you wouldn't think would happen if Apple really
[15:52.460 --> 15:57.880]  didn't have any kind of some somewhere within the company, some support for it, like a Apple
[15:57.880 --> 16:03.960]  script objective C, which is this bridge between Apple script and pretty much the full
[16:03.960 --> 16:11.120]  cocoa UI library. Um, I feel like that might be, uh, an artifact of there being that scripting
[16:11.120 --> 16:17.360]  group that has been since disbanded that Sal Segoian was on, um, saying like, how do we
[16:17.360 --> 16:23.820]  keep our automation stuff relevant and finding a way to kind of just pass objective C stuff
[16:23.820 --> 16:29.440]  on. But it did totally make it like Sal has some demos that are just mind blowing of things
[16:29.440 --> 16:33.000]  you can do with, with what you think of as sort of like user automation, but it's way
[16:33.000 --> 16:37.120]  beyond Apple script where there's like, you know, there's a C routine that does this and
[16:37.120 --> 16:40.620]  you could do it in Apple script, but be complicated and you just call the C routine that just
[16:40.620 --> 16:45.620]  does it. It's amazing. Right. So I, I think when you said like within parts of Apple,
[16:45.620 --> 16:51.300]  that is the truth. Like I have heard that there are like the group that my understanding
[16:51.300 --> 16:54.680]  is the group that bought workflow is not the group that laid off Sal. Right. Those are
[16:54.680 --> 16:59.560]  different parts of Apple and that suggests different attitudes toward user automation
[16:59.560 --> 17:05.680]  at Apple. I don't know. Yeah. And that's, you know, and God bless workflow. I've looked
[17:05.680 --> 17:09.360]  into it, you know, I've, I've made, you know, I think you have to, I always think you have
[17:09.360 --> 17:13.000]  to make something you got to do like a little bit beyond a hello world. You got to do something
[17:13.000 --> 17:18.160]  that's vaguely useful to you and I get it and I see why people are enthusiastic, but
[17:18.160 --> 17:23.940]  it's, and it's amazing that it came from a third party and wasn't something built into
[17:23.940 --> 17:28.420]  the system and is as good as it is, but it really needs to be at the system level. And
[17:28.420 --> 17:33.760]  that's, that's the thing that I, that, that this, my hunch is that this just hasn't, it
[17:33.760 --> 17:40.760]  hasn't percolated to the level where like executives are going to have a meeting where
[17:40.760 --> 17:44.560]  it's like, we have to figure out an actual, we're going to, we're not leaving this, this
[17:44.560 --> 17:49.520]  room until we have an actual strategy that addresses cross platform automation, whether
[17:49.520 --> 17:54.540]  it's actually scripting or some other form, but automation, some kind of way that users
[17:54.540 --> 18:01.200]  can automate tasks and like the photos app on iPad can be automated the same way as photos
[18:01.200 --> 18:05.240]  on Mac. We're not leaving this room until we have a solution. You know that that solution
[18:05.240 --> 18:12.080]  is not going to be to bring Apple script and OSA scripting to iOS. Right. And I think when
[18:12.080 --> 18:16.760]  you look at what Omni group is doing and Sal's million is actually doing some work with them,
[18:16.760 --> 18:21.220]  you know, that, that's my hope is that something like workflow and or something like what Omni
[18:21.220 --> 18:25.760]  is doing where they have a JavaScript scripting engine that's in their Mac products and their
[18:25.760 --> 18:30.920]  iOS products and you can write automation and it's cross platform for their apps. And
[18:30.920 --> 18:36.660]  I think they're placing a bet in part on the fact that they, their users will care and
[18:36.660 --> 18:39.320]  so they're going to build it because they know Apple is not going to just hand them
[18:39.320 --> 18:44.460]  something. But I think they also are hoping that Apple will look at that and go, Oh, actually
[18:44.460 --> 18:48.220]  that's a pretty good idea. Maybe that's what we should use. But you know, people have been
[18:48.220 --> 18:53.020]  doing X callback URL and stuff like that on iOS, passing URLs back and forth for many
[18:53.020 --> 18:58.980]  years now. And at no point did Apple really step up and say, let's make this official.
[18:58.980 --> 19:04.820]  It just, they just, that's not, that hasn't happened. Yeah. Uh, there was a hay day in
[19:04.820 --> 19:09.240]  the early nineties and I don't think it's a coincidence, you know, when I bring this
[19:09.240 --> 19:13.580]  back to script a booger and BB at it, there was a hay day when like the whole developer
[19:13.580 --> 19:20.020]  community kind of got OSA scripting and Apple script were announced and developers got behind
[19:20.020 --> 19:26.460]  them and it just became like, I don't know what's the term, just the de facto, you're
[19:26.460 --> 19:30.900]  not really a good Mac app if you don't have a good scripting dictionary and good support.
[19:30.900 --> 19:35.660]  And there were just, and, and the, the, the thing that people who never got into it and,
[19:35.660 --> 19:39.940]  and never really got into Apple scripting at all, or don't see it now cause the apps
[19:39.940 --> 19:44.060]  they used aren't scriptable was there really was something to the fact where sometimes
[19:44.060 --> 19:48.740]  yes, that I have a whole bunch of scripts that run within BB edit and just do things
[19:48.740 --> 19:55.100]  within BB edit. But when all of your apps are using the same automation system, you,
[19:55.100 --> 19:59.620]  you can come up with things where you're like manipulating text and I'll just send it over
[19:59.620 --> 20:07.900]  to BB edit and BB edit can do the sort the lines and remove duplicates and then just
[20:07.900 --> 20:12.800]  send it back to wherever I was, whatever app that was, and then finish up doing something
[20:12.800 --> 20:17.020]  there and then go to another app and make a graph out of it. You know that you'd have
[20:17.020 --> 20:22.860]  one thing you'd run, press one button and it would involve two, three, four apps in
[20:22.860 --> 20:27.180]  a process that you could then reuse over and over and over again. And I'll bet that was
[20:27.180 --> 20:33.980]  your IDG stuff involved, you know, probably what a word processor quark express. It was,
[20:33.980 --> 20:38.100]  it was the stuff that I was doing was a lot of, it was like data that was in file maker
[20:38.100 --> 20:45.860]  going out to like Eudora for email or generating text files or yeah, or doing stuff in processing
[20:45.860 --> 20:50.300]  text inside of BB edit in order to export to the web or to quark express. All of those
[20:50.300 --> 20:53.700]  things happened and that, that's the magic, right? Is when you're, it's not just like
[20:53.700 --> 20:57.820]  I can script this app, but it's like I can have this app do this thing and tell this
[20:57.820 --> 21:01.580]  other app and you're, you're attaching apps that don't know they don't need to know that
[21:01.580 --> 21:06.460]  they exist as long as you write the stuff that glues them together. And it was, people
[21:06.460 --> 21:10.580]  don't also remember from the nineties for those who weren't around then that, you know,
[21:10.580 --> 21:15.780]  the Mac survival in the nineties was a lot of it was about being in very specific industries
[21:15.780 --> 21:21.820]  like publishing and like the, the reason the Mac held on when it was kind of fading away
[21:21.820 --> 21:28.100]  from a lot of places was those industries needed automation and the Mac had the best
[21:28.100 --> 21:33.460]  automation and, and like Sal came the first time I ever saw Sal Segoian, he was presenting
[21:33.460 --> 21:39.220]  a thing where he was automating a newspaper layout of a classified ad section based on
[21:39.220 --> 21:42.700]  stuff that was in a database. And he ran the script. It's like, Oh my God, what did I just
[21:42.700 --> 21:47.580]  see? The whole page laid itself out based on the database. And like that, that is one
[21:47.580 --> 21:51.620]  of the reasons the Mac survived. And even though maybe end users didn't deal with it,
[21:51.620 --> 21:58.180]  like that stuff being there, there's a reason that that stuff got adopted by everybody is
[21:58.180 --> 22:02.020]  because they also wanted to sell their software into those big accounts. And they knew that
[22:02.020 --> 22:06.060]  that was where the Mac was strong. And that was like the business play for the Mac. Right.
[22:06.060 --> 22:11.420]  And it was great on both ends. Like the classified ads thing is like, no joke. Cause I remember
[22:11.420 --> 22:14.000]  we had something like that at the student newspaper at Drexel. Like, I don't know how
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.000]  we would have done the classifieds without it. And it was great because if you were the
[22:18.000 --> 22:22.980]  person responsible for getting the actual classifieds and a cork express and output
[22:22.980 --> 22:27.980]  onto paper so that they're ready to go to press, it was a great system because you could
[22:27.980 --> 22:31.900]  just hit a button and it would, you know, there'd be very little manual stuff involved,
[22:31.900 --> 22:35.660]  but it was also great from the perspective of whoever was entering the classifieds because
[22:35.660 --> 22:40.900]  you could enter them in a file maker database with a real human interface that was just
[22:40.900 --> 22:46.340]  like everything else on the Mac where it's like, here's the person's name, here's their
[22:46.340 --> 22:51.740]  contact information, here's the text of their ad, here's a pull down menu with the sections
[22:51.740 --> 22:57.400]  of the classified and you could just, and then it's in the system with a human interface
[22:57.400 --> 23:00.340]  and you didn't have to teach them how to use it. You would just teach them like, here's
[23:00.340 --> 23:04.380]  what you open when you want to enter a classified ad, open this and then you see, and then they'd
[23:04.380 --> 23:12.020]  be like, Oh, okay, I get it. So it was a great interface on both ends. Yeah. So that's the
[23:12.020 --> 23:17.900]  reason I think that a lot of this stuff back in the day was like that. And today, you know,
[23:17.900 --> 23:21.860]  it still hangs on and lots of apps have it. And there are a bunch of good apps. Like I've
[23:21.860 --> 23:27.140]  been using Keyboard Maestro a lot more. And one of the nice things about Keyboard Maestro
[23:27.140 --> 23:31.060]  is there are a lot of these apps that aren't scriptable because that's become much less
[23:31.060 --> 23:34.940]  of a thing than it used to be. And Keyboard Maestro just doesn't care. You can just tell
[23:34.940 --> 23:39.480]  it, open this window and click on this button. And you can even say like, find the button
[23:39.480 --> 23:44.080]  with this text on it, wherever it is, and just click on it. And it's like, it's weird.
[23:44.080 --> 23:48.600]  It's like a ghost is using my computer, but it's amazing. So I use that all the time to,
[23:48.600 --> 23:51.460]  because in the end, it's all about saving time. It's not about earning style points.
[23:51.460 --> 23:55.820]  The style points are cool, but in the end, if I can build something in 20 minutes and
[23:55.820 --> 24:00.380]  it saves me four minutes every week, that's going to pay off. It doesn't take very long
[24:00.380 --> 24:04.820]  for that to pay off. And all I have to do is click once and I'm done with whatever task
[24:04.820 --> 24:10.060]  I'm doing. It's pretty great. I'm definitely afraid. I'm about to repeat
[24:10.060 --> 24:13.980]  a story from last week's show, but I have podcast amnesia and don't remember if I told
[24:13.980 --> 24:22.100]  it, but I just recently made a Keyboard Maestro macro. For a while now, I've got a bunch of
[24:22.100 --> 24:26.540]  custom system-wide services that I've written. You know, the things where you can just go
[24:26.540 --> 24:32.000]  to the app, the apps menu, like the Safari menu, go down to services and you apply service
[24:32.000 --> 24:36.380]  and they almost all manipulate text. Like one of my favorites is one I just call Google
[24:36.380 --> 24:42.940]  Lucky and I can type any string I want, like during Fireball iPhone 10 review, select it
[24:42.940 --> 24:48.100]  and then invoke that service. And the service will just return the first result from a Google
[24:48.100 --> 24:53.440]  search for those terms, because I'm so confident that the first that I can make terms that
[24:53.440 --> 24:58.620]  will give me the first answer. And it just replaces those terms with the URL. I've used
[24:58.620 --> 25:04.100]  it for years. It is invaluable because I don't have to, I don't have to go. I don't leave
[25:04.100 --> 25:08.580]  the app I'm writing in. I just write those terms, run the service. I've got a bunch of
[25:08.580 --> 25:13.220]  these services, too many that I could make up unique shortcuts, keyboard shortcuts for
[25:13.220 --> 25:16.980]  all of them. And so what I've thought about for years is, is there a way I can write like
[25:16.980 --> 25:21.540]  an Apple script or something that would just show me all the services that are available
[25:21.540 --> 25:26.160]  and then I could invoke that. And then I'd have this thing that I could like arrow down
[25:26.160 --> 25:32.900]  to the one I want or whatever. And I don't think there's a good way to do it, at least
[25:32.900 --> 25:35.660]  just using simple Apple script or whatever. And then it just dawned on me, like a light
[25:35.660 --> 25:40.260]  bulb went off after years of vaguely wanting this, that I could write a keyboard maestro
[25:40.260 --> 25:46.160]  macro that just opened the services menu and arrowed over to it. And then once that menu
[25:46.160 --> 25:50.320]  is open, you can just use the keys on your keyboard to select menu items by the first
[25:50.320 --> 25:54.220]  name of the thing. Like, so if there's one called title case, I can just type a T and
[25:54.220 --> 26:00.340]  title case will be selected and I can hit return. So I just type now I just type shift
[26:00.340 --> 26:06.380]  command X, that's X because it's like a superpower. And there's no other like system wide modifiers
[26:06.380 --> 26:11.740]  for cut. So I type shift command X, which is very easy with my left hand. And wherever
[26:11.740 --> 26:15.300]  I am, the services menu opens. So I don't need like my own interface, it just opens
[26:15.300 --> 26:20.380]  the services menu, like a like you said, like a ghost has just opened the services menu.
[26:20.380 --> 26:24.220]  And the thing that I had, I've been using keyboard maestro for years and years. And
[26:24.220 --> 26:29.340]  the thing that that I kind of, I didn't like get away from it, but I stopped adding new
[26:29.340 --> 26:33.220]  stuff in it. And there are things that you can do in keyboard maestro now on a modern
[26:33.220 --> 26:38.860]  Mac that are so fast compared to the way they used to be. Like it doesn't when you'd run
[26:38.860 --> 26:44.420]  this macro, it doesn't look like a menus opening, and then a sub menus opening. And then the
[26:44.420 --> 26:49.580]  sub menu gets the input focus. It just happens in an instant. It just is open, right?
[26:49.580 --> 26:52.660]  Trenton Larkin Yeah, I have I have that with a nice cast,
[26:52.660 --> 26:58.100]  which polka fasces and rogue amigba just retired. It's old and it's Yeah, and I know why they're
[26:58.100 --> 27:03.020]  retiring and it's a live streaming app. And it needs a refresh, which is why they're retiring
[27:03.020 --> 27:09.460]  it. It's like old to 30. Yeah, and it was conceived in an era that no longer exists
[27:09.460 --> 27:13.460]  and all that. But the point is that it's got the kind of old style, like drawer with radio
[27:13.460 --> 27:18.300]  button kind of interface that was invoked early on. And I my keyboard maestro stuff
[27:18.300 --> 27:22.660]  for that is amazing because it's like, it's opening windows and doing keyboard shortcuts
[27:22.660 --> 27:27.120]  and clicking on buttons and then closing those windows again. And it happens so fast. I'm
[27:27.120 --> 27:31.420]  not sitting there like watching it open and mouse over and click or anything. It's just
[27:31.420 --> 27:36.420]  like, boop, it and it's done. So I you know, it might as well be invisible, which is pretty
[27:36.420 --> 27:37.420]  cool.
[27:37.420 --> 27:40.140]  Trenton Larkin Yeah. And I think the one I talked about last
[27:40.140 --> 27:44.020]  week on the show, I'm pretty sure was the one I've written recently for tweet bot. I
[27:44.020 --> 27:48.460]  think I talked about this. But the idea is, whenever I respond from an ad during fireball
[27:48.460 --> 27:54.740]  mention, I want to respond from at Gruber, I feel like me, I'm me on Twitter is at Gruber.
[27:54.740 --> 27:59.020]  And at right fireball is the the voice of the publication, which you know, is one person
[27:59.020 --> 28:04.140]  website. So I it's a thing in my head. I don't know if anybody else would notice but but
[28:04.140 --> 28:12.220]  I long wanted a I thought about asking the guys at tap bots to add a feature so that
[28:12.220 --> 28:15.900]  I could say from this account always reply from that account and I felt guilty I could
[28:15.900 --> 28:19.020]  never bring myself to ask because it felt like I was asking them to make a feature for
[28:19.020 --> 28:23.300]  john Gruber and nobody else would want it. Who else would as you know, probably like
[28:23.300 --> 28:27.260]  three people who want this feature. And I realized I could fake it and the keyboard
[28:27.260 --> 28:33.740]  maestro and just have keyboard maestro when only when tweet bot is foremost, listen for
[28:33.740 --> 28:43.620]  command are and then send tweet bot another command are which keyboard maestro is smart
[28:43.620 --> 28:48.700]  enough not to get into an infinite loop and get it actually passes it on. And then that
[28:48.700 --> 28:54.700]  opens the reply window and then just go up to the avatar and open the menu which lets
[28:54.700 --> 28:59.820]  you switch accounts hit down arrow once to get to the top one which is always at Gruber
[28:59.820 --> 29:05.300]  hit return and then every reply I hit with the command our shortcut all is already at
[29:05.300 --> 29:09.860]  at Gruber and it happened. The thing is it happened so fast. I don't even see any kind
[29:09.860 --> 29:15.140]  of flicker. It just it just happens. I mean there is flicker if you look for it, but it's
[29:15.140 --> 29:19.260]  so fast that it doesn't even annoy me and you know, I think it's pretty well known that
[29:19.260 --> 29:25.620]  I'm easily annoyed. It's great. It's yeah, so there's there's I think our point here
[29:25.620 --> 29:29.820]  is that automation user automation is good and there are good tools out there on the
[29:29.820 --> 29:37.340]  Mac and and on iOS with workflow, but I do wish that Apple looked at it at this and said,
[29:37.340 --> 29:41.940]  you know what we could give everybody a leg up by doing some work behind the scenes to
[29:41.940 --> 29:44.940]  support user automation. Maybe they don't need to write their own thing or anything
[29:44.940 --> 29:50.180]  but like do some groundwork to make it easier like the fact that they're those guys who
[29:50.180 --> 29:55.100]  want to want to do a podcast URL like so that if you can click on a link anywhere, it just
[29:55.100 --> 29:59.420]  opens your podcast app and subscribes you to that podcast. But the thing is right there
[29:59.420 --> 30:05.220]  like everybody already did that they did that with a podcast colon slash slash URL and all
[30:05.220 --> 30:11.300]  the podcast apps supported that and then Apple came in and said no you can't do that because
[30:11.300 --> 30:18.540]  the podcast app supports that and iOS has no facility to take a URL and say oh lots
[30:18.540 --> 30:23.380]  of apps can open this URL which one would you like to open it just it's even basic stuff
[30:23.380 --> 30:27.020]  like that that they just have not prioritized. So, you know, that's what I would love to
[30:27.020 --> 30:31.740]  see is Apple to say not we goodbye keyboard maestro and goodbye workflow. We're going
[30:31.740 --> 30:37.220]  to build our own thing that you can only use but just like make I think it makes the lives
[30:37.220 --> 30:41.300]  of people who are doing stuff like what we're doing a little bit better if Apple is an active
[30:41.300 --> 30:46.940]  participant instead of just kind of not paying attention. Yeah, and the one thing one last
[30:46.940 --> 30:50.880]  point on that and whenever I get I get sometimes I get depressed like I said a couple minutes
[30:50.880 --> 30:55.860]  ago because I feel like Apple's heart isn't in it. And then that thing like keyboard maestro
[30:55.860 --> 31:00.460]  and my renewed recent interest in it has reminded me that a lot of what keyboard maestro does
[31:00.460 --> 31:06.900]  is or maybe almost everything that it does is through accessibility APIs. Like back in
[31:06.900 --> 31:12.000]  the old days when keyboard maestro first came out and it wasn't from Peter Lewis and stairway
[31:12.000 --> 31:17.820]  software I think it was the developers name was Michael camp breath. Do you remember that?
[31:17.820 --> 31:22.940]  I don't know. I forget who it was. But like in the because keyboard maestro is another
[31:22.940 --> 31:30.140]  one that dates back to classic Mac OS and the 90s maybe even the 80s I don't know but
[31:30.140 --> 31:37.580]  certainly the 90s. And in those days it was I think it did what it did through let's call
[31:37.580 --> 31:45.980]  it nefarious means. Whereas today's keyboard maestro you have to it's almost useless if
[31:45.980 --> 31:51.100]  you don't grant it you know accessibility privileges which you have to grant an app
[31:51.100 --> 31:55.540]  with accessibility privileges to prevent an app from abusing them to do things you wouldn't
[31:55.540 --> 32:01.600]  want it to do. But then once you grant an app those privileges it makes use of these
[32:01.600 --> 32:07.140]  things through you know APIs that are there for accessibility reasons like you know like
[32:07.140 --> 32:11.180]  you said like finding a button with a certain name and stuff like that. And so the fact
[32:11.180 --> 32:16.080]  that Apple you knew I know that Apple is serious about its commitment to accessibility and
[32:16.080 --> 32:21.340]  all the things they do to keep their software and the APIs that third party developers use
[32:21.340 --> 32:26.260]  to make it as easy as possible to have accessible apps. I think you know I think keyboard my
[32:26.260 --> 32:33.900]  service sort of proof that they can also double as means of automation. Yeah that's a great
[32:33.900 --> 32:38.700]  twofer if as long as that's possible and if there's more down that path I think that's
[32:38.700 --> 32:43.500]  great because I none of us really questions Apple's commitment to accessibility. Yes that
[32:43.500 --> 32:49.220]  one that one is clear. Yeah anyway let me take a break here. Oh here's what I want to
[32:49.220 --> 32:53.860]  say before I take the break. Scratch that I'm not taking a break. I just wanted to say
[32:53.860 --> 32:58.020]  that vague feeling in my head that I've been using script debugger since forever got me
[32:58.020 --> 33:03.180]  to open the about box and see what the copyright date is and copyright date is 19. This is
[33:03.180 --> 33:09.940]  for brand new app that just came out two days ago copyright 1993 to 2018 and then just to
[33:09.940 --> 33:14.220]  double check that my memory hasn't gone too far that I have been using BB edit longer
[33:14.220 --> 33:21.620]  than script debugger. I checked the BB editor about box and it was copyright 1992 to 2018.
[33:21.620 --> 33:27.780]  Both apps look as good as the day they were they were born and remained as relevant as
[33:27.780 --> 33:39.220]  ever which is makes me just makes me happy. Yep me too. All right my thanks to away away
[33:39.220 --> 33:46.660]  makes a really really terrific luggage. They use high quality materials and they offer
[33:46.660 --> 33:51.640]  a much lower price compared to other brands of comparable quality by cutting out the middleman.
[33:51.640 --> 33:55.100]  That's the secret to the internet. They cut out the middleman. They make they use high
[33:55.100 --> 34:01.980]  quality materials they have great design and they sell direct to you without retail markup.
[34:01.980 --> 34:07.400]  They have over 10 colors in a wide variety and they have five sizes. I love their size
[34:07.400 --> 34:13.420]  names because the size names don't need any description. They have the carry on the bigger
[34:13.420 --> 34:19.700]  carry on the medium the large and the kids carry on. If you don't understand what those
[34:19.700 --> 34:25.960]  sizes mean I mean go look at their website and I'll give you the dimensions. All of their
[34:25.960 --> 34:32.140]  suitcases are made with premium German polycarbonate that's very lightweight never bends never
[34:32.140 --> 34:37.780]  breaks the interior which is really I always talk about the wheels and how good the four
[34:37.780 --> 34:43.500]  three sixty four spinning wheels are. Mine is like two years old. I travel a fair amount
[34:43.500 --> 34:48.700]  every time I travel I take my away carry on and the wheels are as good as new. I always
[34:48.700 --> 34:54.080]  talk about the wheels but the inside of their suitcases is so really cleverly designed.
[34:54.080 --> 34:59.460]  They have a patent pending compression system which does a couple of things but the one
[34:59.460 --> 35:03.700]  thing is there's like a panel that you can put like a folded shirt behind at the bottom
[35:03.700 --> 35:07.000]  and then you put this thing there and then there's like belts to cinch it and it keeps
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.780]  like your folded shirts together and they come out about as unwrinkled as you could
[35:11.780 --> 35:15.260]  ever hope for because they're not really in another section and then there's a nice divider
[35:15.260 --> 35:19.260]  and they're packed down good. They have a little bag that when you're when you first
[35:19.260 --> 35:23.860]  leave when you leave house you leave the house and everything's clean it like folds up into
[35:23.860 --> 35:27.820]  nothing but then you can use this bag to put all your dirty clothes in throughout your
[35:27.820 --> 35:32.500]  trip so your dirty clothes aren't getting mixed with your clean clothes or if you come
[35:32.500 --> 35:36.780]  home and you've you know you had a pack with different you know long shirts short sleeve
[35:36.780 --> 35:39.860]  shirts because you weren't sure what the weather's going to be like you don't have to mix the
[35:39.860 --> 35:43.240]  clothes that are still clean with your dirty clothes. What a great idea. I don't know why
[35:43.240 --> 35:47.500]  nobody thought about that before. Everything else you want in modern suitcase TSA approved
[35:47.500 --> 35:52.640]  combination lock I don't know I mean I don't know how great you know the TSA combination
[35:52.640 --> 35:59.700]  lock is but it's the only lock you can use so they've got it and both sizes of carry-on
[35:59.700 --> 36:05.920]  can charge cell phones tablets e-readers anything because they have two USB ports charge up
[36:05.920 --> 36:09.560]  the suitcase like once or twice a year and then you've got a suitcase that can charge
[36:09.560 --> 36:13.660]  your phone while you're waiting at the airport it's it's really useful. Lifetime warranty
[36:13.660 --> 36:19.740]  if anything breaks they will fix it. Free shipping on any away order within the contiguous
[36:19.740 --> 36:25.820]  US sorry Alaska. 100 day free trial so you can live with it travel with it Instagram
[36:25.820 --> 36:29.940]  it whatever you want to do take pictures of it and if you don't like it before 100 days
[36:29.940 --> 36:34.260]  or over you can return it for a full refund with no questions asked I don't know why you'd
[36:34.260 --> 36:38.100]  want to return it if you need a new case you really ought to look at this and they have
[36:38.100 --> 36:43.060]  retail stores now New York San Francisco Los Angeles and Austin Texas which is gearing
[36:43.060 --> 36:49.340]  up for South by Southwest anyway I've got one I love it it's nearly brand new can't
[36:49.340 --> 36:54.420]  believe how many years I went with a roller bag that barely rolled I had like a dragger
[36:54.420 --> 37:00.220]  bag what a what a waste of time and effort so here's the deal you get 20 bucks off your
[37:00.220 --> 37:06.180]  next suitcase if you go to away travel.com slash talk show that's their website away
[37:06.180 --> 37:12.980]  travel.com slash talk show and use that promo code talk show know the at checkout and you
[37:12.980 --> 37:19.380]  will save 20 bucks off a suitcase away travel.com slash talk show my thanks to them really good
[37:19.380 --> 37:28.380]  company I have to hide it's amazing I was just talking to Amy about just it's I wouldn't
[37:28.380 --> 37:32.220]  do it I know I'm telling you I wouldn't do it if I didn't like I'm not going to use a
[37:32.220 --> 37:38.100]  crappy suitcase but it's amazing how much of the stuff I use now is stuff from sponsors
[37:38.100 --> 37:43.480]  of the show and oddly enough it's more sponsors of the podcast than the website there's stuff
[37:43.480 --> 37:49.900]  I use that sponsors of the website but for stuff like the suitcases and the mattresses
[37:49.900 --> 37:56.220]  it's it's the podcast it's crazy and I I got a shipment of this coffee from the last episode
[37:56.220 --> 38:03.180]  it's really really kind of nuts what else here so while we're going down memory road
[38:03.180 --> 38:10.140]  we're talking about the old days of the 90s how about this 10-year anniversary of the
[38:10.140 --> 38:17.780]  iPhone SDK literally today March 6th as as we speak yeah I was I was there in fact in
[38:17.780 --> 38:24.340]  rate reading Craig Hockenberry's amazing blog post about this he linked to my live blog
[38:24.340 --> 38:30.820]  yeah still up at macworld.com my live blog of the iPhone SDK event which was not not
[38:30.820 --> 38:36.140]  just the here's how developers will write apps in this new app store that we're going
[38:36.140 --> 38:41.700]  to introduce but also like the first major update to the iPhone software yes didn't even
[38:41.700 --> 38:46.800]  have a name yes yeah right right and they still didn't give it a name they didn't really
[38:46.800 --> 38:51.820]  the name iOS didn't come until the iPad right I think they called it iPhone OS they called
[38:51.820 --> 38:57.580]  it iPhone OS for a couple years yeah the first the first the first version of the iPod or
[38:57.580 --> 39:04.540]  the iPad ran iPhone OS which was really weird and then they gave it a name but at this point
[39:04.540 --> 39:08.780]  I think they didn't even call it iPhone OS I think it was just the iPhone software sort
[39:08.780 --> 39:13.380]  of like how the iPod had the iPod software version whatever and it didn't even have a
[39:13.380 --> 39:18.540]  real name it was a it was a weird time but but 10 years ago is when they when the sweet
[39:18.540 --> 39:22.220]  solution of you're gonna write web apps for the iPhone finally kind of came down and they
[39:22.220 --> 39:27.240]  said no no we're gonna do an app store here's how it's gonna work and talk about a huge
[39:27.240 --> 39:32.240]  milestone and it was a it was I don't know why it stands out to me but it was an interesting
[39:32.240 --> 39:39.060]  event because it was Jaws it wasn't Steve Jobs and it wasn't Phil Schiller it was Greg
[39:39.060 --> 39:46.980]  Jaws we act right or am I couldn't I am I wrong on that or you did the live blog yeah
[39:46.980 --> 39:54.900]  I should I should look I mean it's Jobs it's Jobs and Schiller oh maybe it was Jaws who
[39:54.900 --> 40:01.260]  did it no I must be misremembering it with one of the years where Steve was was ill it
[40:01.260 --> 40:09.660]  was no I got it it's ill it's 10 it's a 10 0 1 a.m. on March 6 2008 my live blog says
[40:09.660 --> 40:15.580]  Phil I think Steve said Phil and Scott for stall will do the heavy lifting yeah and so
[40:15.580 --> 40:20.020]  it was Phil and Scott who did all of it yeah that makes that makes sense for the first
[40:20.020 --> 40:27.100]  one that actually does make sense especially for stalls involvement I I loved Craig's put
[40:27.100 --> 40:32.040]  I will put it in the show notes I love Craig's write-up and the thing that it's so mind-blowing
[40:32.040 --> 40:43.260]  to me that there was this really active developer community before the SDK came out entirely
[40:43.260 --> 40:49.980]  through jailbreaking and through backwards-engineered access to the API's that Apple you know the
[40:49.980 --> 40:53.820]  private API's that Apple had used to write all the apps that were on the on the phone
[40:53.820 --> 41:00.700]  already and and it it just blows my mind and they had it working in Xcode because that's
[41:00.700 --> 41:05.540]  the thing that I love about the Apple developer community is that they don't just want to
[41:05.540 --> 41:09.580]  get it working it's not just enough to have a hack that works it should be as nice as
[41:09.580 --> 41:15.500]  possible like it wasn't just that they were writing software that ran on the iPhone they
[41:15.500 --> 41:19.280]  were writing software that looked as good as Apple software because it was using the
[41:19.280 --> 41:25.020]  actual native API's and you know like the lights out game the first game for iPhone
[41:25.020 --> 41:31.460]  looked as good as any app you know any game could look on the iPhone and they had instead
[41:31.460 --> 41:35.620]  of like doing it all through like a command line you know incantations and stuff they
[41:35.620 --> 41:43.140]  got it working in Xcode it was nice I mean not nice compared to a real proper SDK but
[41:43.140 --> 41:49.140]  for nothing but jailbreak access to the API's it was nice and it happened so fast we had
[41:49.140 --> 41:53.900]  you know the C4 conference that Craig talked about where there was like a developer contest
[41:53.900 --> 41:59.540]  like a you know what can you hack together in 48 hours the apps were amazing and it was
[41:59.540 --> 42:04.300]  that was August so we the phone only came out on what like June 29th or something June
[42:04.300 --> 42:11.720]  30th so I'm like that within like seven weeks six seven weeks there was there were third
[42:11.720 --> 42:17.860]  party apps being written for this phone that had no SDK it was amazing and it was so terribly
[42:17.860 --> 42:23.500]  exciting everybody I mean everybody wanted immediately to write apps for it there's that
[42:23.500 --> 42:27.940]  famous somebody actually did find it they actually found the mp3 of it that podcast
[42:27.940 --> 42:32.900]  that you and Merlin and I did yeah the day after the iPhone was announced where we all
[42:32.900 --> 42:37.100]  basically it was wasn't it the day of was it that afternoon it might have been it was
[42:37.100 --> 42:42.180]  at that Macworld Expo where we basically described the App Store like obviously this is what
[42:42.180 --> 42:46.020]  they're going to do it's going to be curated this whole thing and the developers we were
[42:46.020 --> 42:50.560]  talking to I mean all of them wanted to write software for it and you could see in Craig's
[42:50.560 --> 42:55.900]  blog post like the moment that they could jailbreak it and get into it and start like
[42:55.900 --> 43:01.000]  dumping out like what was Apple doing and figuring out how Apple was writing their apps
[43:01.000 --> 43:05.980]  and like they would not be denied it's it's one of these stories we think about jailbreaking
[43:05.980 --> 43:10.780]  today and it's all about kind of like piracy and trying to get around things that Apple
[43:10.780 --> 43:15.960]  is doing but back in that first iPhone it was literally like Apple didn't want to let
[43:15.960 --> 43:21.700]  anybody in yet and the the developers would not be denied and they would write software
[43:21.700 --> 43:27.080]  without any SDK at all they reverse engineered Apple stuff because they just they had to
[43:27.080 --> 43:31.580]  do it we we all knew the moment we saw it despite that whole web apps or a sweeps sweet
[43:31.580 --> 43:36.540]  solution thing we all knew what was going to happen and the great thing is that like
[43:36.540 --> 43:42.060]  a year later less than a year later it happened which I mean it could have gone on way longer
[43:42.060 --> 43:46.200]  than that but Apple you know they to their credit they prioritized and they got that
[43:46.200 --> 43:52.900]  thing out I have always felt and I don't know about the time and I think reading his biography
[43:52.900 --> 43:58.780]  and other things it seems like maybe jobs wasn't completely on board I think they announced
[43:58.780 --> 44:04.100]  that the SDK would be coming in like November Craig's probably got in his article but it
[44:04.100 --> 44:14.340]  was you know it was like the iPhone came out in well WWDC came first right WWDC was early
[44:14.340 --> 44:20.020]  June so we didn't have the iPhone yet right yeah they announced it right in January at
[44:20.020 --> 44:23.860]  Mac World Expo but it didn't ship until the end of June right so they announced the iPhone
[44:23.860 --> 44:30.780]  in January at Mac World Expo 2007 in early June there was WWDC and they had a whole WWDC
[44:30.780 --> 44:35.260]  and it was all about Mac OS X as it always had been and then at the very end they're
[44:35.260 --> 44:39.060]  like now everybody knows you know later this month we're shipping iPhone we couldn't be
[44:39.060 --> 44:43.980]  more excited about it and we've been hearing about a lot of developer interest and we think
[44:43.980 --> 44:48.820]  we have a really sweet solution and the room that this is the problem with that sweet solution
[44:48.820 --> 44:56.220]  thing and a lot of people linked to my write-up about it because I called it a shit sandwich
[44:56.220 --> 45:00.140]  you know and people agreed but that that it was this there was a sucker punch element
[45:00.140 --> 45:06.380]  to it because it's at the end of the WWDC keynote and the room is filled not just with
[45:06.380 --> 45:12.500]  like the the Mac World Expo crowd of generic enthusiasts it was filled with 4,000 paying
[45:12.500 --> 45:19.260]  developers I Mac developers who knew the cocoa APIs in and out and knew that the iPhone was
[45:19.260 --> 45:24.100]  using cocoa API so they could use the same things they knew on this amazing new device
[45:24.100 --> 45:28.220]  and he says we think we have a really sweet solution and there's this moment where everybody's
[45:28.220 --> 45:35.940]  a all great good and they're like you can write web apps yeah and it was it's funny
[45:35.940 --> 45:42.420]  because in October is when they did it in October they said there was actually a Steve
[45:42.420 --> 45:46.660]  Jobs one of those Steve Jobs notes that that was very clearly written by him because it
[45:46.660 --> 45:52.580]  begins with the words let me just say it yeah Colin we want native third-party apps on the
[45:52.580 --> 45:56.980]  iPhone and we plan to have an SDK by February and shipping at the very beginning of March
[45:56.980 --> 46:02.900]  so it obviously after WWDC and all that they got they got the feedback that the sweet solution
[46:02.900 --> 46:07.340]  was not going to do it right well I think what happened in hindsight was it it they
[46:07.340 --> 46:11.780]  wanted to ship as soon as they could they knew you know and and it's one of those things
[46:11.780 --> 46:20.220]  that Jobs was I think so good at is being able to pinpoint when a first product was
[46:20.220 --> 46:23.900]  ready to ship and it was one of those things that I think he got better at as the years
[46:23.900 --> 46:28.040]  went on you know like whatever you want to say about the first iPod the first iPod was
[46:28.040 --> 46:32.420]  terrific we loved ours we didn't buy to Amy listen to portable music more than I did but
[46:32.420 --> 46:37.540]  we bought the very first 399 iPod that had a firewire interface a click wheel that really
[46:37.540 --> 46:42.380]  spun it still works I at least the last time I fired it up it still worked we used it for
[46:42.380 --> 46:47.600]  years years and years we we never bought another full-size hard drive iPod that was the one
[46:47.600 --> 46:53.960]  that we used I won one in a contest once for having written markdown so a couple years
[46:53.960 --> 47:00.760]  later I I want a newer version so I had one and she had one the next iPod that that she
[47:00.760 --> 47:06.740]  got was you know a nano with flash storage because it was it it was great it had five
[47:06.740 --> 47:12.900]  gigabytes which is you know what small by future but it was a fantastic product and
[47:12.900 --> 47:17.000]  the iPhone was amazing it obviously shipped at the right time the first iPhone had many
[47:17.000 --> 47:22.860]  deficiencies it only had edge didn't have 3g seemed expensive compared to other phones
[47:22.860 --> 47:27.980]  although seems cheap compared to a top-of-the-line iPhone today so I don't know if that's even
[47:27.980 --> 47:32.360]  a I think that wasn't a problem with the phone but a problem with the markets mindset on
[47:32.360 --> 47:37.180]  what a cell phone should cost and I I got so much use out of it it was amazing I even
[47:37.180 --> 47:45.500]  at edge speeds having the web on on my phone was life-changing would it have been worthwhile
[47:45.500 --> 47:51.780]  to wait until the internal API's of what we now know as iOS were ready and stable so that
[47:51.780 --> 47:55.920]  they could open it up to third parties no I think they made the completely right could
[47:55.920 --> 47:59.100]  they be the only thing they could have done differently is they could have delayed the
[47:59.100 --> 48:04.220]  whole thing by another year to wait till everything was settled down internally to a point where
[48:04.220 --> 48:09.540]  they could have the you know the sandbox and everything they wanted to have or they could
[48:09.540 --> 48:14.100]  ship it without third-party apps and suffer for a year with the criticism but I don't
[48:14.100 --> 48:18.900]  think internally even jobs ever really doubted that they wouldn't have native apps eventually
[48:18.900 --> 48:25.180]  I think it was only a question only a question of how would it really would it be like the
[48:25.180 --> 48:29.660]  App Store we have today where there's a literally like a million apps or would they restrict
[48:29.660 --> 48:35.300]  it and and really cultivate it and only have like thousands of apps and make it like a
[48:35.300 --> 48:38.820]  genuine privilege that you'd have to you know like getting into college or something you
[48:38.820 --> 48:43.180]  have to be accepted and you know lots and lots and lots of apps would be rejected I
[48:43.180 --> 48:45.980]  think there might have been debates like that but the fact that they would have an App Store
[48:45.980 --> 48:51.060]  period there's no I really don't think they had any doubt yeah I think I think it was
[48:51.060 --> 48:56.800]  very clear I think they were smart to do it if you think back to 2007 like the killer
[48:56.800 --> 49:00.540]  apps for the first year of the iPhone were the apps that were on the iPhone yeah we would
[49:00.540 --> 49:06.980]  have liked third-party stuff but like Safari on the iPhone alone was a killer app because
[49:06.980 --> 49:12.600]  it was you know it's it's table stakes now but like a real web browser that loaded real
[49:12.600 --> 49:18.540]  web pages on an iPhone was enormous and and yeah the music app was good too like the apps
[49:18.540 --> 49:22.600]  that were there were really good and that first year like you think oh man you couldn't
[49:22.600 --> 49:26.220]  load any new apps no but the apps that were there were so amazing how about having I was
[49:26.220 --> 49:34.140]  enough mail and Safari and for how about having a humane understandable interface to SMS like
[49:34.140 --> 49:41.380]  SMS was invented but my SMS on my Nokia before I had before my iPhone it was just one list
[49:41.380 --> 49:50.660]  of messages it wasn't sorted by people it was it was crazy how bad it was and now all
[49:50.660 --> 49:58.020]  of a sudden it was every bit as easy as using I chat yeah yeah so it's it's I think that
[49:58.020 --> 50:01.820]  was that gave him a year I mean if I had been there hopefully somebody argued that right
[50:01.820 --> 50:06.180]  that was like this gives us we don't even need to have a third-party app answer right
[50:06.180 --> 50:10.600]  away because we've got the right apps on it now including the browser and the browser
[50:10.600 --> 50:16.380]  solves so many problems because like there within months there were versions of like
[50:16.380 --> 50:21.960]  web pages that were I am clients where you could log into yeah from inside the web page
[50:21.960 --> 50:25.880]  it's like you didn't even need the app I mean the app would be way better but like you could
[50:25.880 --> 50:31.140]  get it done just through that browser so that that was enough of a release valve to keep
[50:31.140 --> 50:35.380]  them to keep them there but I agree with you I think that it was very clear that they wanted
[50:35.380 --> 50:41.140]  to do real third-party apps but you know I mean the story I always tell is that when
[50:41.140 --> 50:45.540]  I use that iPhone in January at Macworld Expo several of the apps when I tapped on them
[50:45.540 --> 50:53.140]  it was literally just an image of a UI mock-up there was no like there was no actual contacts
[50:53.140 --> 50:57.580]  or or or notes buttons like every button was just painted it was just a ping it was just
[50:57.580 --> 51:03.660]  a it was no yeah it was literally just a graphic file that opened and you couldn't do anything
[51:03.660 --> 51:07.460]  because the only some of the apps were working so like the iPhone was such a moving target
[51:07.460 --> 51:11.940]  that there's no way they needed to they needed to learn how to write iPhone apps and then
[51:11.940 --> 51:16.580]  they needed to learn how to communicate that and how they would roll it out but like I
[51:16.580 --> 51:20.500]  think when the iPhone shipped they didn't quite know how to write iPhone apps yet they
[51:20.500 --> 51:25.620]  were just still figuring it out so it was inevitable that that they would have to wait
[51:25.620 --> 51:30.300]  what was great is that so many developers didn't wait until the day the SDK announced
[51:30.300 --> 51:34.260]  like Craig Hockenberry and all of those people that who just they weren't gonna wait they
[51:34.260 --> 51:39.600]  were gonna take it apart and examine it and that shows you how badly everybody wanted
[51:39.600 --> 51:43.660]  to be in the App Store and for people who weren't around then like day one I remember
[51:43.660 --> 51:47.900]  sitting on my couch like not eight feet away from where I'm sitting right now on the day
[51:47.900 --> 51:53.980]  that the App Store opened and downloading all of these there's so many apps in the store
[51:53.980 --> 51:59.360]  on day one because the developers were so excited about doing it you know brand new
[51:59.360 --> 52:05.820]  platform nobody really knew how it was gonna go and there were you know hundreds of new
[52:05.820 --> 52:12.600]  apps on day one I remember that that whole first year and I'm you know I don't know if
[52:12.600 --> 52:18.180]  I'm an introvert I don't understand those words and those those those you know like
[52:18.180 --> 52:26.740]  ITSP or whatever the hell you know I've like looked at that several times in my adult life
[52:26.740 --> 52:30.540]  and I don't understand it at all I took that test and it's like a hundred is one end of
[52:30.540 --> 52:34.220]  the scale and zero is the other end and for the introvert extrovert I got a 50 yeah I
[52:34.220 --> 52:37.660]  think that I don't know what the hell I think yeah something like that I don't know I'm
[52:37.660 --> 52:41.620]  at the end of the scale I'm at the end of the scale where you don't understand the scale
[52:41.620 --> 52:48.900]  it's sexy but I think part of me is I mean I'm obviously you know I do a podcast and
[52:48.900 --> 52:55.000]  I've spoken in public people will come up and see me like at WWDC and I'm happy to greet
[52:55.000 --> 52:59.220]  them I really am it's a thrill I love it you know they're like are you John Gruber I love
[52:59.220 --> 53:02.940]  it right I've been there with you we've both had it happen and it's it's a real thrill
[53:02.940 --> 53:07.660]  to me people but like like that whole first year with the iPhone I didn't like it when
[53:07.660 --> 53:11.760]  I'd be like at the grocery market and some random stranger would be like oh my god is
[53:11.760 --> 53:16.940]  that an iPhone I did not like I was like put off and I would I would be nice I you know
[53:16.940 --> 53:21.940]  I'm a people pleaser I would say yes and they would say how do you like it and I would say
[53:21.940 --> 53:29.420]  I love it it is life-changing it is it is worth everything that you've heard about it
[53:29.420 --> 53:33.420]  but I just I got it all the time you might have gotten it less in California but I'll
[53:33.420 --> 53:37.860]  tell you what in Philadelphia like the first year if you had an iPhone it was like something
[53:37.860 --> 53:44.180]  like people would see it and it's funny too I might have I've always been a non case user
[53:44.180 --> 53:50.300]  although I'm trying a case right now with my iPhone 10 but I would say at least 95 percent
[53:50.300 --> 53:56.540]  of the days probably maybe even higher since 2007 when I first got an iPhone the iPhone
[53:56.540 --> 54:02.140]  in my right front pocket has not had a case there were no iPhone cases for the first iPhone
[54:02.140 --> 54:05.700]  or at least there weren't it wasn't like anything like today because it was a new thing and
[54:05.700 --> 54:09.520]  nobody knew I would have bought a case for the damn thing that made it tried to make
[54:09.520 --> 54:15.060]  it look like a Nokia phone or something because or a BlackBerry something because it was it
[54:15.060 --> 54:21.260]  was like a sensation but then on the other hand when I'd be with people who did have
[54:21.260 --> 54:27.340]  iPhones other people who did have iPhones and so it wasn't quite so you know like talking
[54:27.340 --> 54:33.220]  to strangers the fact that I had lights out installed on my iPhone as a jailbreak and
[54:33.220 --> 54:36.540]  I would be like oh yeah do you have did you get the update with the game and they're like
[54:36.540 --> 54:43.440]  what and I'd show them lights out which a was fun and it was it's a game that's super
[54:43.440 --> 54:47.220]  easy to understand I'll put a link in the show notes because Stephen Troughton Smith
[54:47.220 --> 54:52.380]  has a version that a faithful version that still is available in the App Store but it's
[54:52.380 --> 54:56.020]  you know it's basically like one of those games that you and I had in the late 70s and
[54:56.020 --> 55:00.140]  early 80s that you could get at a toy store like you know some kind of you know like Simon
[55:00.140 --> 55:07.540]  or something like electronic and vaguely computerized but you know in the way like the skeuomorphic
[55:07.540 --> 55:14.080]  way that like you know that the phone looked like an actual phone and stuff like that having
[55:14.080 --> 55:18.740]  a game that looked like a plastic electronic game on your iPhone was amazing but nobody
[55:18.740 --> 55:23.940]  else had a game on their phone or on their iPhone at least you know and they had like
[55:23.940 --> 55:29.060]  some piece of crap snake eating game on the Nokia thing so being able to show people that
[55:29.060 --> 55:32.740]  when people saw that I was just like oh my god this App Store thing is going to be humongous
[55:32.740 --> 55:36.680]  because when I show people that I have a game on my phone that and I don't even like games
[55:36.680 --> 55:43.060]  for the most part I'm not really a gamer but it was so clear that it was going to be huge
[55:43.060 --> 55:49.100]  yeah this is the tech industry and you know just passing through time in general so many
[55:49.100 --> 55:52.880]  things happen that you think oh well we didn't really know whether that thing was going to
[55:52.880 --> 55:57.700]  work or not you know who knew that this unlikely thing would happen the App Store is not one
[55:57.700 --> 56:02.060]  of those things it was very clear like the moment we saw the iPhone we're like oh yeah
[56:02.060 --> 56:05.540]  that this is huge and the moment you know we started thinking about the App Store it's
[56:05.540 --> 56:09.780]  like no it's going to be gigantic and it turned out like there was no doubt it was so clear
[56:09.780 --> 56:14.860]  all the you could argue that the entire arc of the computer industry and the software
[56:14.860 --> 56:18.220]  industry was leading to that moment where it's like oh we got all the pieces now we
[56:18.220 --> 56:23.500]  can just this can happen and we can all have a computer in our pockets and buy software
[56:23.500 --> 56:28.040]  by tapping a couple of buttons and install it automatically wirelessly like that all
[56:28.040 --> 56:32.300]  the pieces finally lined up and it was very clear from the beginning it was going to be
[56:32.300 --> 56:40.740]  enormous yeah I in hindsight I'm almost as excited thinking back to the origins of the
[56:40.740 --> 56:49.080]  iPhone SDK and those pre SDK jailbreak apps as I am as I was you know earlier in the year
[56:49.080 --> 56:54.540]  just thinking back to the 10-year anniversary of the iPhone itself like the you know and
[56:54.540 --> 56:59.660]  in 10 years it they kind of blur together and it's so most people I mean I don't know
[56:59.660 --> 57:07.080]  how many iPhones they sold that first year but all very few people had an iPhone without
[57:07.080 --> 57:12.220]  the iPhone SDK and without the App Store right I mean it's a very very small number of us
[57:12.220 --> 57:17.460]  percentage wise maybe not listeners at a show but certainly of all the people on the planet
[57:17.460 --> 57:23.100]  today with an iPhone who who had an iPhone in 2007 or early 2008 that before the App
[57:23.100 --> 57:28.620]  Store that's a very small number and it even for us it kind of blurs together it's kind
[57:28.620 --> 57:33.300]  of hard to remember that year but you know like Craig bringing it back really just reminded
[57:33.300 --> 57:39.620]  me how exciting it was it really did sort of epitomize everything Apple stands for which
[57:39.620 --> 57:45.700]  is or at least what I think it stands for is making the best hardware for consumers
[57:45.700 --> 57:54.580]  but also encouraging technically minded users to make great things for it right and it goes
[57:54.580 --> 57:59.260]  hand in hand or with it you know so maybe the great thing you're making with it isn't
[57:59.260 --> 58:05.500]  an app but it's you're you're an illustrator and all of a sudden you can do your illustrations
[58:05.500 --> 58:11.940]  in Adobe Illustrator and their vector and they can scale to these insane sizes and you
[58:11.940 --> 58:17.140]  know you can make complex illustrations that you never could have with traditional pre-computer
[58:17.140 --> 58:21.780]  you know tools you know also all the things like that the way that you can you know just
[58:21.780 --> 58:29.460]  be creative and make things and the iPhone really epitomize that all right maybe I'll
[58:29.460 --> 58:32.760]  take another break right now it seems like a good time seems like a nice interruption
[58:32.760 --> 58:40.500]  in the show and I'm going to tell you about a brand new sponsor company called Squarespace
[58:40.500 --> 58:49.540]  Squarespace is a it is a website it's a service where you can go and you go there and you
[58:49.540 --> 58:54.700]  sign up you get a free account to start with and what you can do is you can make your own
[58:54.700 --> 58:59.940]  website and your website can have your own domain name it can have your own style they've
[58:59.940 --> 59:05.020]  got an amazing assortment of professionally designed templates to choose from these templates
[59:05.020 --> 59:10.980]  look great on everything from a giant 27-inch iMac all the way down to your phone and the
[59:10.980 --> 59:15.500]  templates aren't just like visual styles it's their functional and their layout wise so
[59:15.500 --> 59:19.780]  like let's say what you're doing is starting a podcast where you can do it at Squarespace
[59:19.780 --> 59:28.560]  and you can use the Squarespace platform to create episodes and to host audio and something
[59:28.560 --> 59:33.700]  like that or let's say you want to set up a store and you're selling t-shirts or something
[59:33.700 --> 59:39.140]  like that well you can set up a catalog and there's online commerce all hooked up in it
[59:39.140 --> 59:43.700]  any type of like oh that's the sort of thing I want to do with a website or you have a
[59:43.700 --> 59:47.180]  restaurant and somebody you know is opening a restaurant and they need a website for the
[59:47.180 --> 59:54.900]  restaurant they should do it at Squarespace because a it's it's less work it's not it's
[59:54.900 --> 59:58.640]  you're not becoming a full-time webmaster or whatever words we used to use for this
[59:58.640 --> 01:00:04.820]  it's less work be it is terrific top-notch technology at their stuff is super fast and
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:12.440]  the interface for making changes and stuff is really really humane it is not about going
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:18.120]  in and editing HTML and CSS and JavaScript and picking application frameworks for the
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:21.540]  online stuff although if you want to you can get in there if you're capable of doing stuff
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:26.820]  like that they don't lock you out of it but the primary interface is visual it's WYSIWYG
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:32.100]  you just drag stuff around you click a template and click apply and it's applied to all of
[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:38.460]  your pages at once and it just works it it makes having a website not be part of your
[01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:43.300]  job it's just something you can just create and be done with and it's super great for
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:49.100]  people who are technically minded people who could make a website from scratch and people
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:54.400]  your friends or family know that you are capable of that and they come to you for help when
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:01:00.340]  they need a website you can have them go to Squarespace and help them set it up or just
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:04.500]  point them there and let them take it from there because it's that easy and then you're
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:08.120]  you can wash your hands of it you're done you've put them in good hands you don't have
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.780]  to feel guilty because you're giving them a second-rate experience they're gonna get
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:14.660]  a great website and it's gonna have great service gonna have you know ninety nine point
[01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:19.460]  one nine nine nine uptime and then you don't have to do the work and if they do have a

[01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:35.080]  you know needs a website which is really really really where I think Squarespace is like the

[01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:11.580]  seem like the sort of sponsor who in my opinion should do a lot of podcast sponsored advertising
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:15.780]  I think it'd be a good fit I think it's a fit I do I think that from what I know the
[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:20.660]  people who listen to podcasts and what I know about this amazing new service it seems like
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:26.920]  a seems like a fit so I have a piece as we record I haven't published it yet hopefully
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:32.580]  by the time the show comes out it'll be out it may not be because the older I get the
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:40.280]  less the less sure I am about when I'll be done with a piece that isn't truly in checking
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:49.140]  for typos copy editing yep but I want to write about Apple in China and I've been relatively
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:57.340]  quiet about this because I wanted to think about it but the news is that for Chinese
[01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:05.000]  based iCloud users it's either happened already or is in the process of happening this month
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.720]  so close you know close enough it's happening right now Apple is transferring their iCloud
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:19.420]  accounts from Apple's own Apple owned iCloud data centers to data centers in mainland China
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:26.900]  that are owned by a Chinese company that Apple has contracted to run the data centers for
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:36.020]  iCloud users in China and the reason for this is that China has passed a law that says that
[01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:41.380]  online services like this that serve customers in China have to have to have their servers
[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:49.100]  on Chinese soil I'm not a lawyer I don't really think this makes that big a difference I think
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:55.060]  that companies like Apple could comply with this law by opening Apple owned data centers
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:59.260]  in China it's it's just that they have to be on Chinese soil and are subject to Chinese
[01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:06.740]  law like I think one way to comply would be for Apple to own and create and operate data
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:12.960]  centers in within China the way that these companies some Chinese regulations are specifically
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:18.480]  like a Western company can't own like own a whole thing in China they have to be an
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:22.460]  investor in a local I own so it may be that there's also an ownership issue there right
[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:26.660]  all right so maybe maybe a hundred percent Apple owned wouldn't be possible but anyway
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:31.220]  it has to be partially Chinese owned and so Apple is doing this Microsoft is doing this
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:39.980]  with their Azure services or Amazon's doing it with the Amazon web services China or Google
[01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:44.740]  I guess is not because Google has effectively as of several years ago effectively pulled
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:58.380]  out of China right and is this a good thing no it is clearly I think the world where where
[01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:03.140]  because the company that Apple's contracting with in China is at least partially state
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:11.900]  owned who knows it's very I've read a lot of articles about it and it's really nobody
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:19.300]  seems to know and I don't know that there is a way to know but effectively I think that
[01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:25.260]  the before and after is that Chinese iCloud China did the iCloud data of Chinese users
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:32.940]  is now more susceptible to being you know searched by Chinese government authorities
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:37.500]  than it was before when it was stored outside China on Apple owned data centers and that's
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:46.940]  not a good thing and people are upset about this so what should Apple what should Apple
[01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:53.500]  do the thing that I want to address is that it seems to me that an awful lot of people
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:06:00.420]  who care about this seem to think that what Apple should have done instead of complying
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:07.980]  is they should have not complied and just kept things the way they were with Chinese
[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:17.900]  users iCloud data on Apple's own servers outside China which sounds good but is not to be offensive
[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:23.260]  to those of you who think that's what Apple should do is incredibly facile it is you've
[01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:27.980]  you haven't thought this through all the way if you think that that's on the table because
[01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:36.300]  it's not if Apple tried that yeah they're the iCloud servers services would be cut off
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:44.460]  by the government yeah a new a new Chinese law that says you have to do this is not one
[01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:49.000]  of these things that's like really open to interpretation like and and presumably given
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.940]  how how big Apple is in China and how many things Apple is doing in China including they've
[01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:58.300]  got like they've got like offices there and centers there and they obviously they sell
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:01.460]  they've got retail and then they sell a lot of phones there there's so many ways that
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:07.100]  Apple is invested in China there's no way that they don't have very clear line of communication
[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:12.280]  with the Chinese government and when a law passes that says you have to do this they
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:18.660]  know that means they have to do it like there's no there's no wiggle room there's no appeal
[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:24.040]  to a different authority like this it's a done deal when the law happens because the
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:29.420]  Chinese government controls the whole process and so they obviously they just said to Apple
[01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:36.120]  we're gonna have to run your servers for you like that was the deal and it's the thing
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:42.340]  that people point out and it is a good thing to compare it to but the the the conclusion
[01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:53.680]  is far from clear is people say well how come in America last year when in the that San
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:08:04.140]  Bernardino mass shooting when the law enforcement had an iPhone owned by one of the perpetrators
[01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:10.500]  and it was locked and they wanted Apple to they wanted Apple to unlock it Apple said
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:16.780]  we can't unlock it and they said well we want you to create a new version of iOS where we
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:23.100]  can circumvent the lock and then install that version of iOS that circumvents it on this
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:28.300]  iPhone so then we can get the phone which is a subtle difference from unlock it it's
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:32.560]  technically the version of iOS that was on that Apple made and designed could not merely
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:39.280]  be unlocked there is no secret key that Apple holds that would unlock a phone which is a
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:45.520]  good thing and I don't we could spend two hours just talking about why that is but the
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:51.900]  more relevant thing is that Apple Apple stood up to these claims in a very public manner
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:57.020]  and they weren't thumbing their nose at US law enforcement in my opinion they were incredibly
[01:08:57.020 --> 01:09:02.600]  respectful but they were also very adamant about what that they weren't going to come
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:08.600]  they weren't going to do it and they why they don't think that there should be laws passed
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:15.620]  that would force them to do it and they did this in a very public manner and obviously
[01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:21.940]  made no such public fuss regarding this change in China and so that's taken by some as proof
[01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:26.300]  that Apple cares about like American users in a way that they don't care about their
[01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:32.340]  Chinese users and I would argue I can't disprove that but I would argue that the difference
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:40.120]  is entirely not about Apple's take on Americans or North Americans versus Chinese users but
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:44.640]  it's entirely about the differences between the United States government and the Chinese
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:50.380]  government the United States government has some problems has a lot of problems I would
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:58.180]  say it has more problems than it did about 18 months ago but it is still a representative
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:06.520]  democracy with a history of individual civil liberties and a legal system where everybody
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:13.220]  from individuals from corporations gets their day in court and can fight things legally
[01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:17.780]  and as freedom of speech and can can talk about things publicly China has none of those
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:23.860]  things there an authoritative communist effectively dictatorship and it's actually taken a turn
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:31.000]  more towards dictatorship just in recent weeks because President Xi Jinping has apparently
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.340]  gotten I don't think they've actually made this official but they are going to change
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:44.000]  their constitution so that he can remain president as long as he wants which could be for life
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:50.420]  there is no there is no way for Apple to legally make a big public stink about this in China
[01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:59.500]  and it's also a different culture where it Apple making a stink about it in the Western
[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:06.360]  media I guess couldn't be ruled illegal in China like you can't break a Chinese law by
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:17.580]  having Tim Cook go on 60 minutes and berate the Chinese government for passing this law
[01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:24.000]  but I you're being deeply deeply profoundly naive if you think there wouldn't be significant
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.980]  repercussions of that I mean I don't even know I mean this is this is I think it's people
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:34.020]  either don't understand or just being just disingenuous when they when they suggest if
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:40.960]  they do suggest that in China oh well you could appeal to the courts and maybe the legislature
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:45.660]  and it's like no that's not it's it's one thing like the decision is made it's like
[01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:52.100]  you said it's an authoritarian it's a one-party rule it's essentially a dictatorship it is
[01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:57.040]  this is this is what Apple has been told they need to do just like Microsoft and Amazon
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:02.060]  and everybody else and so in the end what is Apple's real choice here right like Apple's
[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:10.540]  real choice is either do it or leave China basically or like turn off iCloud in China
[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:15.660]  which is going to which would be like kind of break all sorts of features of iOS I think
[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:20.820]  I think they might do that but then then you know who knows what that's going to mean for
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:25.060]  their relationship with the Chinese government who might not appreciate Apple breaking their
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:32.460]  products in order to avoid complying with this with this law here's a statement that
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:40.000]  Apple gave I saw the same statement in a couple of news articles it's only attributed to the
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:46.760]  company there's a direct quote while we advocated against iCloud being subject to these laws
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:53.460]  we were ultimately unsuccessful Apple said that's the only thing that's actually quoted
[01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:57.060]  I don't know that the statement I don't know if there was more that wasn't quoted or what
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:01.580]  but then the rest of the art news of Reuters article Apple said it decided it was better
[01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:06.640]  to offer iCloud under the new system because discontinuing it would lead to a bad user
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:11.720]  experience and ultimately actually lead to less data privacy and security for its Chinese
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:17.900]  customers and that's the point that's the point that I think is being overlooked yeah
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:24.620]  let's not forget that because of Apple's various philosophies about how data is transmitted
[01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:31.940]  much of what goes through iCloud is encrypted in transit and on the server so like the idea
[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:37.180]  here is Apple has built iCloud so that if Apple wants to look at your data on the server
[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:45.940]  it can't see it without you know it's it's just encrypted and resides on the server so
[01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:49.860]  they've tried to build this system you could argue they've tried to build this system so
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:14:00.060]  that Apple nor any government that might force Apple to spy on your data they can't they
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:07.060]  can't do it it's not made to work that way and that benefits them in China now I think
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:12.540]  the next question is at what point if the Chinese government said you need to modify
[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:17.580]  your software so that cloud data is not encrypted they could also do that in America by the
[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:21.460]  way that was one of the questions about the San Bernardino case is that you know the American
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:26.780]  government could pass laws saying no more end-to-end encryption that we can't break
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:30.700]  and if they did that you know guess what Apple would follow the law because they're not going
[01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:36.380]  to not do business in the world they have to do that they would fight against it but
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:39.820]  ultimately if that was the law they would have to follow it that is a question I think
[01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:44.220]  I have about China is if the point of this is really just to control this data because
[01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:48.700]  they really want to look in it the next step is going to be to tell Apple that they can't
[01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:53.600]  encrypt data on servers in China and then that's to me that's a bigger question for
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:59.260]  Apple because now you're changing your software to be less secure in certain parts of the
[01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:04.420]  world right and and and that you know they that may be when you walk away and say well
[01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:09.100]  we can't have our customers have their data be unencrypted on the server but right now
[01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:16.900]  it is right except for like I'm at iCloud email right yeah and the US has passed laws
[01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:24.220]  like that I mean unfortunately truly unfortunately the US lawmakers have really seemed deeply
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:33.200]  and profoundly ignorant about the encryption and don't seem to probably everybody in any
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:38.000]  field feels the US law are all lawmakers around the world are deeply ignorant of whatever
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:45.020]  fields they are but it seems to me like particularly so with encryption it's you know I'm not good
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:52.180]  at it and I you know the was like one degree one class short of a math minor and in college
[01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:56.740]  I mean I'm pretty good at math and I'm pretty good with computers and I get lost in it but
[01:15:56.740 --> 01:16:01.900]  I have a basic idea but I remember there were different some bad laws in the US I mean there
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:09.820]  was remember the DC SS thing it was like there was a simple algorithm that would be scrambled
[01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:18.340]  DVDs and it leads and I was ruled illegal to use it even though it's just an algorithm
[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:24.140]  but it was short enough that you could print the whole algorithm on a t-shirt and is this
[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:29.740]  t-shirt illegal because it contains code that would that if you put it you know translated
[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:36.100]  it into machine form would descramble a DVD I mean it was it's absurd and in my opinion
[01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:40.980]  not a lawyer but in my opinion a violation of the First Amendment of free speech that
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:46.780]  you know if you can express an algorithm you know the algorithm should be free speech but
[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:50.940]  there were also laws on the strength of encryption you know again going back to the 90s that
[01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:55.380]  was like a very 90s thing and it was like the you could only export computers and software
[01:16:55.380 --> 01:17:00.180]  that had really weak encryption and so if you wanted to have software that was sold
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:04.460]  around the world it you know there were limits on how strong you can make the encryption
[01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:09.800]  and whatever limits you place on encryption today they're weaker as time goes on and computers
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:14.500]  get more powerful you know what might take an hour to crack today might take a minute
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:23.740]  in a couple of years it's all very complicated but ultimately you know and so we're not out
[01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:27.380]  of the woods like you know point being we're not out of the woods here in the US and in
[01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:33.120]  the rest of the West as well but China is obviously you know the place where you could
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:37.180]  expect that to be to be clamped down I think the question of what would Apple do if China
[01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:43.500]  demanded a backdoor into every phone sold in China is a far more fascinating and interesting
[01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:47.620]  question than the one we're dealing with here with the China with the data centers like
[01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:52.860]  I don't want to I don't think Apple took this lightly at all and I think that this statement
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:18:00.060]  that they advocated against it I would take it I would believe that they advocated against
[01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:04.960]  it as strenuously as they felt they could at the very highest levels they felt they
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:11.140]  could reach I really do but that in China that sort of thing takes place behind the
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:15.500]  scenes and I think that the most you know the most you're going to get out of what that
[01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:22.060]  was publicly is a statement as what would you call it anodyne as while we advocated
[01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:29.220]  against it you know that that's publicly that's the most you can get away with without angering
[01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:33.420]  you know your counterparts in China and you know let's face it let's say and that's you
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:38.220]  know let's address the elephant in the room which is that there's an enormous sum of money
[01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:42.540]  involved it's almost unimaginable how much some of money I think right now I looked it
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:48.740]  up and it's actually fluctuated quite a bit over recent years because there was a while
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:52.540]  where iPhones weren't really available and then they were and they were super popular
[01:18:52.540 --> 01:19:00.700]  and then about two years ago what was it like around the 6s and the 7 were didn't seem to
[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:06.300]  sell as well in China it was like the iPhone 6 did incredibly well because all of the Asian
[01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:10.780]  countries the really big phablet size phones seem to do better than they do everywhere
[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:20.180]  else and Apple was famously late to the bigger than four inch phone market so combining that
[01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:26.700]  they hadn't had a big phone before and they're very popular in Asia the iPhone 6 was you
[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:30.740]  know hugely popular and then it dipped in popularity and people think it might be because
[01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:36.000]  in China people were more sensitive to the appearance of the phone and they didn't want
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:41.900]  to buy a new iPhone 7 that just looked like an iPhone 6 and that you know that sort of
[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:47.100]  sentiment obviously exists everywhere but it might be stronger in China but anyway it's
[01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:52.100]  dipped it's gone up and down but it's been roughly like 8 to 12 percent of Apple's revenue
[01:19:52.100 --> 01:20:00.860]  I think those were the it's they're averaging somewhere between 11 and 15 11 a quarter billion
[01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:04.740]  dollars a quarter percentage aside I mean it's a huge percentage but it's also yeah
[01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:09.540]  if you think about that somewhere even we say between 11 and 15 billion that's a 50
[01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:13.980]  billion dollar a year chunk of money that comes from China and you know let's face it
[01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:17.740]  that's a lot of money it's a lot of money and so that's I mean I think that would be
[01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:22.120]  the question that's enough money to get the it's enough money to draw the very steady
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:27.180]  attention of the most profitable country in the world a company in the world right I mean
[01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:31.200]  yeah and Tim Cook talks about a lot about how he's bullish on China and he thinks in
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:35.780]  the long run it will be Apple's biggest market right so and the idea that there is a middle
[01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:41.060]  class a potential in the next 15 20 years there will be a middle class in China the
[01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:45.500]  size of the entire population of the United States right like and that's and that's Apple's
[01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:52.700]  opportunity in China is to reach those people and so you know they I don't think that Apple
[01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:58.180]  will do anything it can to stay in China right I think there are limits and I do think I
[01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:03.940]  actually do think that at least for now the Chinese government is aware of that and I
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:06.700]  don't think they have all the leverage here right like I think the Chinese government
[01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:11.040]  wants to push as far as they can all the time but at the same time I think they like it
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:16.580]  having Apple it adds that cachet that Apple is in their country and and is participating
[01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:21.220]  in their economy and is bringing these goods in that people like or in this case making
[01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:26.140]  them there and then shipping them inside China and all that but you know you get my point
[01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:31.140]  here like I do think there is a point where Apple would walk away but it would be an interesting
[01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:35.500]  thought exercise to say what would that be like would it be you have to unencrypt all
[01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:39.140]  the data in the cloud so we can see everything that's on every device of every iPhone in
[01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:44.060]  China would that be enough to make Apple walk away I don't would would software changes
[01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:49.740]  that only occur in China I'm Apple already adds support for like social media stuff that's
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:56.180]  inside China special built into iOS because and Mac OS because those services don't exist
[01:21:56.180 --> 01:22:00.740]  outside and they were created as Chinese alternatives to what's in the rest of the world like how
[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:05.500]  far would they push Apple before Apple would say you know what we can't we're gonna walk
[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:11.400]  away from 50 billion dollars a year yeah I don't know and who knows it could be 75 billion
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:14.940]  dollars a year by the time it happens right I mean I think Tim Cook believes that it'll
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:19.740]  be a hundred and fifty billion dollars a year in the next 15 years right and so it's a lot
[01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:24.140]  to walk away from but I do everybody has their price I suppose but I do believe there would
[01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:29.460]  be a line where Apple would be like we can't go there and I I'm I'm not sure China wants
[01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:35.240]  that either I think China like I don't know I don't pretend to know what the Chinese
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:39.340]  government wants anywhere but it would seem to me like there is some value in in Apple
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:44.060]  being in China for China as well and I do think there is a moment where Apple would
[01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:48.340]  walk away I'd like to believe that anyway I get the impression and I could be wrong
[01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:53.340]  but I think it's and you have to be worried about all these you know surveillance and
[01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:58.940]  civil rights and search and seizure at all countries but I get the feeling that here
[01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:05.740]  in the US what the government and through you know really law enforcement is most interested
[01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:12.420]  in is epitomized by the San Bernardino case which is what they want is for when a crime
[01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:19.420]  happens and they get a phone off a suspect they want to take that phone and plug it into
[01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:25.860]  a thing and see everything on the phone and to collect evidence and you know your location
[01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:34.380]  and photos and your texts and your emails and for a very long time I don't know if
[01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:41.980]  you remember this you mean but there weren't such things as cell phones and there weren't
[01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:48.460]  such things as digital cameras and you know police when they had a suspect would collect
[01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:52.260]  whatever would just collect whatever evidence they could and then they would use that to
[01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:57.700]  build their case and then there was a time when there were cell phones and the cell phones
[01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:02.820]  had no encryption whatsoever and you could just plug any cable into them and plug them
[01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:12.900]  into any computer and see all sorts of things and now and the police really like that and
[01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:17.280]  now most phones are encrypted and when you plug them into a new computer you've you've
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:20.460]  got to be able to do you've got to be able to circumvent you know you either have to
[01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:27.620]  find a flaw in the OS or you need to compel the suspect to hand over the passcode to open
[01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:32.200]  their phone and there's no mathematical way around it again you can find a bug in the
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:37.380]  OS that would let you get around it and apparently there's one of those recently in iOS that
[01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:43.300]  is it's almost beside the point here but there's a recent one there's a couple of reports that
[01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:49.620]  some Israeli security company is selling law enforcement a work around the passcode entry
[01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:54.660]  limit on iOS so that you can put the take a confiscated iPhone put it up to a machine
[01:24:54.660 --> 01:25:01.140]  and it'll start trying numeric passcodes and they've figured it's not known what the workaround
[01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:06.300]  is but they found a way around the limits that Apple places on that I don't know we
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:11.060]  don't know details but anyway either a bug in the OS or get the user's passcode from
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:19.280]  them that it's to me that what I think the u.s. is mostly interested in in the bad legislation
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:24.260]  that is most likely to pass China on the other hand is building a surveillance state and
[01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:29.860]  you can you can certainly make the case that the u.s. post 9-11 and the West you know Western
[01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:36.460]  Europe has built up too much of a surveillance state over you know regular citizens but China
[01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:43.840]  is building like a truly dystopian you know sci-fi horror futuristic just you know surveillance
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:48.380]  state with cameras and facial recognition and every every bit of technology you can
[01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:51.740]  imagine and so I would imagine that in China the thing that would be the most dangerous
[01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:56.400]  would be some kind of legislation about encrypted communication and that they would just want
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:01.480]  everything unencrypted so they can you know their version of the NSA can just suck it
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:09.660]  all in yeah it's it's I mean again this is why I like Apple's policies about encryption
[01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:15.340]  but they could make encryption illegal again and they could try that and the only recourse
[01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:22.360]  there would be to for everybody to get upset and put pressure on the politicians to not
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:26.740]  allow those laws to pass I think we talked about this I think on this show when the Santa
[01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:32.180]  Barbara thing happened that law enforcement's job is to do as much as possible it's not
[01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:35.580]  their job to be restrained and they're not restrained and that's fine because it's the
[01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:44.060]  court's job and it is the law's job to limit what the police can do and and that's that's
[01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:48.460]  just how it's supposed to work so I don't I don't really I don't want to complain about
[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:55.860]  the FBI saying we want everything from Apple I want a judge to look at laws passed by Congress
[01:26:55.860 --> 01:27:01.440]  and say mm-hmm no you can go this far but no further that's that's the right balance
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:06.300]  there and in the US hopefully you know we can have some of that and China they've got
[01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:10.680]  none they got none of that it is it is a scary prospect the idea that the next stage here
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:16.660]  is for China to say okay now you need to not encrypt anything and right and that's that's
[01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:20.660]  the point where I start to say I can see the argument for Apple to walk away but I don't
[01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:26.220]  think we're there yet and I think that to your point Apple walking away makes a worse
[01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:31.140]  experience for iPhone users in China like Apple staying in China iPhone users in China
[01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:36.400]  get to use Apple products and they get to use iCloud with their data end-to-end encrypted
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:43.100]  and that's all good like that's good for Chinese Apple users even though it prevents the people
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:47.420]  I think the people who you know people the people want Apple to make a big political
[01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:51.860]  statement and say no China is bad we're out of China and Apple has been very pragmatic
[01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:55.740]  about it since the beginning which is it's better for us to be there than not and as
[01:27:55.740 --> 01:28:00.100]  long as that's the case I think they'll stay and yeah it is very profitable there's no
[01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:03.620]  doubt about it but I would hope anyway that they would there would be some moment when
[01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:08.060]  they would be like we will go this far but no farther I think the only three options
[01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:12.380]  that they have the only three realistic options in broad strokes would be to do what they're
[01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:17.980]  doing which is continue selling their products and their services and host them in Chinese
[01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:26.580]  owned data centers be continued to sell their products but no longer offer any iCloud services
[01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:33.620]  to Chinese users and I don't know like do you know like I always say iCloud iCloud iCloud
[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:39.600]  but this does this affect the iTunes as well like like is the App Store hosted in in this
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:45.020]  I haven't found an answer to that yeah I that I that I don't know that's an interesting
[01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:50.180]  question I know that if it were you know that they're subject to the laws right where because
[01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:54.340]  they removed the VPN apps from the Chinese App Store because the legally they were told
[01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:58.900]  they need to do that that's that it was against the law to have them there whether I'd imagine
[01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:03.380]  that it is I imagine those have to be on their servers in China too but it's covered by the
[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:11.020]  law regardless Apple has a fact about this and it's very interesting to me here's the
[01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:14.240]  whole thing I'm going to read the whole thing Apple services in the mainland of China are
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:18.940]  now operated by Chinese Internet Services company I'm going to do a terrible job of
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:26.540]  this goo-zoo on the cloud big data industrial development company limited which which is
[01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:34.140]  a very Chinese sounding name the cloud big data industrial development company limited
[01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:37.860]  this allows us to continue to improve iCloud services in China and comply with Chinese
[01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:42.860]  regulations iCloud services and all the data you store with iCloud including photos videos
[01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:47.600]  documents and backups will be subject to the new terms and conditions of iCloud operated
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:56.320]  by GCBD if you are not a Chinese citizen residing in the mainland of China you can and this
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:30:01.700]  is a link edit the country or region setting of your Apple ID to reflect your current country
[01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:08.260]  or region and continue using iCloud under Apple's terms and conditions I believe that
[01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:13.800]  that means like so if you and I went to China for a while or you know like Apple employees
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:20.320]  who were there for months at a time you know working in the supply chain that it just because
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:24.620]  they're in China because they're not Chinese citizens they're not subject to this and they
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:28.940]  can edit the country and I'm guessing that editing the country has probably limited by
[01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:33.740]  like where your payment source is coming from like I don't think it means that anybody in
[01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:39.440]  China can this is a giant loophole where any Chinese citizen can just claim to be from
[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:44.860]  another country to be in Hong Kong instead and right just yeah but it doesn't say anything
[01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:49.500]  about the App Store I don't know but if it did then there's a region I don't so that's
[01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:58.260]  a side point Taiwan but I wonder what the Hong Kong users use GCBD or do they get a
[01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:02.360]  separate thing because the Hong Kong laws are a little bit different and then this point
[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:07.200]  stands if I'm in mainland China do I say no no I'm in Taiwan yeah that's it and just keep
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:14.300]  on using that or or not I I don't know I was probably not I was probably you can't get
[01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:19.000]  on the internet if you don't say you're in China when you're in China I don't know I
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:23.040]  don't know but if it if it if it means software updates have to come from these services to
[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:26.420]  then it would effectively mean they can't not comply because they can't sell iPhones
[01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:31.100]  and not be able to ship software updates I don't know what the answer to that is but
[01:31:31.100 --> 01:31:34.720]  that is the other option but I don't think that's tenable I don't really I feel like
[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:39.740]  there's too many of these features that are the the core part of it you know I mean HomePod
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:47.200]  literally can't work without a connection to iCloud to talk to Siri you know there's
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:50.880]  no way to talk to it I mean what do you get I mean I guess you could use it as an AirPlay
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:56.980]  speaker but you know who's gonna buy the HomePod as an AirPlay speaker you know when the main
[01:31:56.980 --> 01:32:01.480]  interface doesn't work so I just don't think it's tenable I don't even think it's worth
[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:06.320]  spending the time on the show to say why I feel like this iCloud services are too central
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:14.520]  to most consumers use of Apple products particularly the iPhone I mean sure in an industrial setting
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:18.760]  there's all sorts of ways you could use a Mac or that you might even want to use a Mac
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:23.840]  without any kind of iCloud stuff set up on it but let's face it we're talking about the
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:30.920]  iPhone here and so the third option would be to stop selling the iPhone in China and
[01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:34.640]  obviously that would be a huge hit financially to Apple and I think at this point I honestly
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:39.080]  think it's I think I think it's questionable whether Apple could do that and they could
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:47.120]  obviously do it legally but I feel like in terms of would investors allow that I mean
[01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:52.080]  I honestly think it could cost Tim Cook his job if he if this was the line he was willing
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:57.280]  to draw and I I'm not melodramatic about such things I don't call you know I wouldn't call
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:05.680]  for him to be fired over it but would it investors be so outraged that they that that they would
[01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:13.200]  force him out would the would the board allow it I don't know I'm unclear on because I think
[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:17.040]  this is another interesting intellectual exercise which is I'm unclear on what Tim Cook would
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:25.120]  have to do to get fired like is choosing human rights over the Chinese market something that
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:29.660]  would be a look that the that the board of directors and investors in Apple would want
[01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:35.620]  to say no no we want ruthless approach it does not matter what happens in China we want
[01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:42.000]  their money and that's all that that matters to us would they would they do that or not
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:47.560]  I'm not sure that they could get away with doing that but it is a question of like what
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:51.560]  would it take what if Tim Cook was like we're gonna not even sell the iPhone anymore or
[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:58.620]  whatever at what point they're like no no no okay you need to go now I'm not sure given
[01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:06.980]  Apple's corporate philosophy I don't think that a decision to it's gotten so bad inside
[01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:10.280]  China that we just have to leave and we're regretful and we hope to come back someday
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:16.760]  but you know we respect our our customers in China and so we're pulling out ah boy that
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:20.940]  would be really hard to fire him over that right so I'm not sure that I that it would
[01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:24.220]  be a tough business decision though for sure because it would be kissing off billion hundreds
[01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:29.520]  of billions of dollars a year and if future and you know future growth it's you know it's
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:34.120]  no joke so would it cost him his job I am absolutely unwilling to say that I almost
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:39.800]  want to say no probably not but it I it could I think it's unpredictable I don't think anybody
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:46.000]  could predict that the the repercussions of this somebody who knows the board could could
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:51.960]  give us the answer somebody who's on the board you know Al Gore hit me up yeah you know Al
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:56.780]  Gore could could could give us an answer and say whether the board would allow it who knows
[01:34:56.780 --> 01:35:00.640]  if they've talked about it right I it seems to me like the sort of thing that the board
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:08.280]  would talk about in great detail what would shareholders do and what would you know what
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:12.660]  happens if you know and shareholders can't just barge in and fire Tim Cook but shareholders
[01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:19.280]  can dump their Apple stock and if Apple loses massive amounts of market cap in the aftermath
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:24.600]  of this it it could force the board's hand I'm just saying it's unpredictable and any
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:29.140]  other factor the x-factor in this is what would the Chinese government do to Apple if
[01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:36.220]  Apple were to to do something like that to make a big show of pulling out of China the
[01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:42.640]  consumer market or of going into the Western press and be rating the Chinese government
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:46.900]  over this which is another thing that I think the idealists would like to see Tim Cook do
[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:53.720]  to prove that he cares and that he's not a hypocrite who's only interested in the money
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:36:00.240]  because Apple cannot they cannot pull out of China completely they they're they're manufacturing
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:06.580]  an assembly that's right cannot take place at the scale they need to take it to take
[01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:11.320]  place at and I think I'm not an expert on it but I don't even think even vaguely close
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:20.260]  to the scale there is no there is no plan B if Apple isn't manufacturing in Shenzhen
[01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:24.860]  and at Foxconn there's no other place in the world through you know again this could be
[01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:32.100]  a great two-hour conversation with Jeff Williams about the unique aspects of you know China
[01:36:32.100 --> 01:36:36.580]  for the supply chain but there is nowhere else there's nowhere else where you can make
[01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:42.340]  70 million iPhones in a quarter can't happen not even close I don't even know if Apple
[01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:48.540]  had to make iPhones even if they were given a two-year head start and that two years from
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:52.500]  now the iPhone would have to be entirely would never have could never set foot on Chinese
[01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:58.140]  soil I don't even know what the most iPhones they can make a quarter is but it would be
[01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:03.540]  a fraction tiny fraction of what they sell now it would create her the company yeah I
[01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:08.880]  agree you know I you could argue and again this sounds like her a purpley but I actually
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:14.020]  think it's it's true is that the most the most powerful person in the world when it
[01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:20.380]  comes to Apple's fate might be you know Z's and Peng you know that the Chinese could if
[01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:24.660]  they chose and I don't think they would I think that they are they're looking to engage
[01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:29.540]  more with the West and their economic success over the last few decades is all about that
[01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:33.380]  I mean the last thing I want to look at is look like is a crazy you know crazy place
[01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:39.420]  where Western businesses can't trust them right the long the long game might be to build
[01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:43.660]  up their own internal capabilities so that they're so powerful that they can start to
[01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:49.100]  dictate what they sell in the rest of the world and they take over but today this is
[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:55.820]  one of those places where Apple has leveraged today if the perception was that no out no
[01:37:55.820 --> 01:38:03.960]  non Chinese tech company could build their products in China anymore it would be brutal
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:09.100]  and it would take time right but the tech industry could abandon China right if China
[01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:13.600]  pushed it too far and that would be devastating for the Chinese economy because the Chinese
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:18.940]  economy we think about how huge it is in terms of of the people who are in China but Chinese
[01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:27.320]  economy is still in in development and if you turn away all of that foreign investment
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:32.560]  in manufacturing and all of those things and make it an unpleasant place to be then it
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:36.800]  that would really hurt China so that's what that's what those who are not Chinese have
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:40.700]  going in terms of leverage with the Chinese government is like kicking if they kicked
[01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:45.460]  Apple out like I mean would all of the tech companies probably be like okay we need to
[01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:48.740]  start pulling out of China or hedging our bets and that would be bad for China so they
[01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:55.020]  probably wouldn't do that but you know I don't know the delicate repercussions ramifications
[01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:59.180]  of Apple having a bad relationship with the Chinese government in terms of you know their
[01:38:59.180 --> 01:39:04.060]  manufacturing costs and getting approval for new plants and all of those things it might
[01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:11.260]  be brutal yeah it's like the trade war equivalent of mutually assured destruction like you can
[01:39:11.260 --> 01:39:18.980]  do it are easy I've been assured I'm assured they're easy to win easy to win you know why
[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:24.460]  we've been on the air Gary Cohn has resigned yeah well it's you know it's infrastructure
[01:39:24.460 --> 01:39:32.220]  week it's it is hard to get through a two-hour podcast without at least one senior Trump
[01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:38.620]  administration official resigning while you're while you're in in Skype it's you know we
[01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:43.820]  do upgrade on on Monday mornings I do that with my Carly and it never fails that Apple
[01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:50.000]  releases a beta or there's a more German report or there's always something that happens during
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:55.060]  that and like I guess at this time we get a resignation it's time the resignation clock
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:59.780]  went off yeah must be it's Tuesday afternoon must be a resignation so I was gonna say to
[01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:04.940]  the question of a few minutes ago of whether Hong Kong is is is part of this and I said
[01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:08.740]  you know who we need to ask is a friend of the show Ben Thompson who because he lives
[01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:16.060]  in in Taipei is intimately familiar with this and literally while I was thinking it he texted
[01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:24.420]  me and so I've quick well while you're here it is real-time follow-up yeah it is outside
[01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:29.980]  it Beijing controls it and it's a very I knew this it's it's you know it was a hand handed
[01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:36.060]  over from British control to right Beijing control 1997 but they're outside the Great
[01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:41.500]  Firewall and they still have their own immigration their own passwords and so it is not a greater
[01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:47.100]  China from an average greater Chinese China right that is the thing I sometimes conflate
[01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:51.180]  is what is officially mainland and it is kind of common sense because if you have to cross
[01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:55.700]  some of the Pacific Ocean to get an island yeah it's not the mainland so if you have
[01:40:55.700 --> 01:41:01.140]  to cross the ocean you're outside mainland China so it's Hong Kong it's close though
[01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:09.760]  right Hong Kong is like a peninsula anyway my my geography is it's not such a Hong Kong
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:16.420]  iCloud users it's got hit special it's special status what were we talking about just before
[01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:26.180]  that before Ben Thompson interrupted the show so rudely I don't know at my request anyway
[01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:33.140]  it's complicated I guess we were talking supply chain stuff yeah in theory Apple could move
[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:40.540]  it outside but it would be years long it would be a disruption to end all disruptions I don't
[01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:45.380]  think that's in China's interests either but in smaller ways China if Apple decided
[01:41:45.380 --> 01:41:52.980]  to be test to violate what they would consider the decorum I don't know what you want to
[01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:57.780]  say there are ways that they could make Apple's life slightly more uncomfortable like I don't
[01:41:57.780 --> 01:42:01.920]  think they would do it if Apple played hardball they would make they would turn up the heat
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:06.700]  on Apple and it would be an Apple's got enough stakes in China that it would be uncomfortable
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:12.140]  and and so Apple you know they both both sides have leverage and I think there's probably
[01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:17.940]  a lot of conversation and negotiation that goes on behind the scenes yeah and then we
[01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:27.860]  probably don't see almost any of that there was a story in 2014 release of iPhone 6 delayed
[01:42:27.860 --> 01:42:32.300]  in China Apple is facing a potential setback in China one of its biggest and fastest growing
[01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:36.580]  markets after the much-anticipated introductions here of the new iPhone models were delayed
[01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:42.220]  on Wednesday Apple told China's this was a dateline September 10 so probably like the
[01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:48.300]  day after the announcement on Wednesday Apple to China's big three big state-owned mobile
[01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:53.140]  service providers that it would not release the iPhone 6 and 6 plus on mainland China
[01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:58.260]  on September 19 when sales start elsewhere the carriers had already booked advertising
[01:42:58.260 --> 01:43:03.660]  campaigns for the phones the move set off consternation among apples there's a New York
[01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:08.100]  Times story by the way as well as with consumers who had been eagerly awaiting the introductions
[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:12.560]  Apple did not explain the delay executives at the carrier said but it appeared the phones
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:20.520]  had not received approval from Chinese regulators to go on sale this to me reading between the
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:28.480]  lines is that something happened and Apple somehow pissed somebody off in China and someone
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:33.820]  in China decided to delay the iPhone I mean do you think that it didn't receive approval
[01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:40.340]  from Chinese regulators because Apple forgot to file the paperwork on time I I'm sure that's
[01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:46.460]  it I'm sure I'm sure Bob down and in a in a legal it's like oh right China I had to
[01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:51.900]  do and I got like a checklist of countries and it's like you know FCC in the US check
[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:58.260]  you know Great Britain check Germany check Oh China forgot about it no this to me you
[01:43:58.260 --> 01:44:05.260]  know and then iPhone 6 did go on sale eventually but at the very last minute after the three
[01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:11.260]  carriers had already placed a big ad campaigns about with the date September 19 that Apple
[01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:17.520]  says up and even the it appears to be that that it was held up by the regulators that
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:22.300]  nobody appeared the phones had not received approval from Chinese regulators to go on
[01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:31.260]  sale that's the type of thing that is different about China than the US and it's subtle right
[01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:37.820]  it's not we're going to shut down your factory and Foxconn it's at the last minute you're
[01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:42.540]  going to have you're going to have to go to these companies and say it won't go on sale
[01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:50.180]  you can't tell them why and tough right that's the shit sandwich that China the Chinese government
[01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:56.400]  gave Apple in 2014 is oh yeah you thought your phone was going on sale in nine days
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:05.520]  nope and you don't tell them why and that's it and there's probably a thousand little
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:13.680]  ways that China could screw with Apple like that let me take a break here and thank our
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:23.380]  third final sponsor of this episode Casper Casper has a new mattress called the wave
[01:45:23.380 --> 01:45:28.060]  and it's the most innovative mattress that they've ever made the first mattress of its
[01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:33.500]  kind to relieve pressure at 36 different points so you can feel relaxed in ways you never

[01:45:56.060 --> 01:46:03.020]  deep restorative sleep whether you're a back stomach or side sleeper and I'm going to tell
[01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:10.620]  you personally I'm all three I every time I wake up in the night I always switch I will
[01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:15.420]  go from I sleep all three ways but it doesn't matter some people sleep all sleep on the
[01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:22.460]  you know the same way my wife is pretty much a side sleeper the Casper wave is designed
[01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:27.460]  for all three and it gives you support and relief everything you need for a good night's
[01:46:27.460 --> 01:46:32.820]  sleep and thanks to their patent-pending contouring system it adjusts your body and your natural
[01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:39.480]  curves the wave boasts a high quality sleep surface comparable to similar high-end mattresses
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:45.100]  on the market for less money because they sell direct to you you've heard that before
[01:46:45.100 --> 01:46:50.340]  experience their most innovative mattress in your home with the hundred-night risk-free

[01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:04.140]  thing that's the key that's you think like I don't know about buying a you know a mattress
[01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:07.840]  even if it's cheaper than other brands if it's lower price because they're selling direct
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:13.780]  it's still hundreds of dollars might be over a thousand for a big one I might spend a thousand
[01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:17.940]  bucks on a mattress that I've never even seen I'm telling you a hundred nights risk-free
[01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:22.340]  get it they ship it to you in the little tiny box that is ridiculous you cannot believe
[01:47:22.340 --> 01:47:30.820]  that there's like a queen or king mattress in there you open it up and the wave purchases
[01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:36.520]  if you get a wave it comes with in-home white glove delivery and setup for free this is
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:40.300]  you know let's face it this is a wave deluxe mattress this is this is the higher-end thing
[01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:43.580]  but you don't even have to take the box up the stairs they get the the people come in
[01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:49.980]  they set it up for free and you still get the hundred-night risk-free trial that's how

[01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:28.260]  hundred bucks terms and conditions do apply but go to casper.com slash talk show one hundred
[01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:32.940]  find out more about this great mattress and save a hundred bucks hundred bucks that's
[01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:39.060]  how you it's like we're paying you to listen to this podcast you're making money you get
[01:48:39.060 --> 01:48:45.140]  to you got one of those caspers oh yeah it's yeah just like the uh just like the away yeah
[01:48:45.140 --> 01:48:48.140]  i didn't want to spoil it i didn't want to spoil like you i didn't want to spoil the
[01:48:48.140 --> 01:48:51.980]  third i got all the podcast stuff too i didn't want to spoil it earlier but i figured that's
[01:48:51.980 --> 01:48:55.780]  what you were talking about yeah yeah what you could do you know you can combine these
[01:48:55.780 --> 01:49:00.000]  things you could uh depending on like you know like let's say you live in a small apartment
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.860]  you don't have a lot of storage space you could put your uh you could put your away
[01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:11.020]  suitcase underneath your bed that has a casper mattress on it for storage uh you know look
[01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:15.460]  at that synergy i could mention what kind of underwear you're wearing but they're not
[01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:21.820]  a sponsor this week so i'm not going to uh the last oh you know what there's two topics
[01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:27.260]  left and i know we've been on for a while i don't want to have another four hour episode
[01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:30.900]  i would just i'm going to spoil them both i'm going to say i want to talk about these
[01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:36.620]  macbook air rumors and the the state of the macbook air and i think we'll do that first
[01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:41.300]  and then uh i told you already i want to talk about this nra tv and what apple and amazon
[01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:47.380]  etc should do about them um the macbook air rumors you you have got a column uh i think
[01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:50.740]  i've gotten a pre-release access to it i don't know if that's authorized or not but you've
[01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:55.340]  got a macworld column about this so i'm going to let you summarize the situation because
[01:49:55.340 --> 01:50:00.900]  it's a terrific so so the the macbook air there's this rumor from kgi that they're going
[01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:06.140]  to update the macbook air and maybe cut the price although kgi's uh track record pricing
[01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:11.300]  is not as great as supply chain so but you know something going on with a macbook air
[01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:15.500]  and i had one of those moments of like what the hell is going on with the macbook air
[01:50:15.500 --> 01:50:22.220]  like it sticks around it is old it's got all the tech that apple has already replaced in
[01:50:22.220 --> 01:50:30.740]  all of their other laptops but it sits there because it's 999 and apple has not um taken
[01:50:30.740 --> 01:50:36.940]  other products and like gradually reduced their prices to hit the 999 and then kicked
[01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:42.100]  the macbook air to the curb that hasn't happened um but nor have they canceled the macbook
[01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:48.020]  air and say and said look if you want a new apple laptop you need to spend 1299 on a macbook
[01:50:48.020 --> 01:50:53.860]  or a 13-inch no touch bar macbook pro like you those are your choices um they haven't
[01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:58.180]  done that and i think the reason is that they feel like they're really vulnerable in certain
[01:50:58.180 --> 01:51:03.200]  markets including education where there's a market there's a segment of their buyer
[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:08.220]  you know their buying group of their customer group that is not gonna you know that a thousand
[01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:12.700]  dollars is a is a brighter line and that they need to be competitive down there and so they
[01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:16.900]  keep the macbook around i also get the sense from people who work at apple stores that
[01:51:16.900 --> 01:51:20.300]  the macbook air still sells really well yeah and that there are a lot of them around you
[01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:24.460]  were saying to me um yesterday that like you went into a cafe and there's macbook airs
[01:51:24.460 --> 01:51:28.220]  everywhere it's a cafe that i go into all the time because it's the closest place to
[01:51:28.220 --> 01:51:33.220]  get coffee that's not my kitchen and there's a lot of i think they're grad students because
[01:51:33.220 --> 01:51:40.940]  they're clearly students uh i often see um it i'm so old now that like i don't i can't
[01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:44.900]  tell the difference between a 26 year old and an 18 year old but i think that they're
[01:51:44.900 --> 01:51:50.140]  grad students and the the tell is that i often see them with a stack of blue books uh and
[01:51:50.140 --> 01:51:56.300]  so that means they're grad assistants grading grading papers um uh it's you know but it's
[01:51:56.300 --> 01:52:01.060]  a big uh you know big there's lots of places to sit lots of counter space along the windows
[01:52:01.060 --> 01:52:05.460]  all on the outside so you could fit a lot of people and i always i did i can't help
[01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:09.260]  it whenever i'm in an airport or a coffee house or any place where people are using
[01:52:09.260 --> 01:52:14.440]  devices i just i don't i usually don't count and keep track but i do like a eyeball survey
[01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:20.460]  of what people are using and macbook airs are clearly uh insanely popular i remember
[01:52:20.460 --> 01:52:25.340]  it was you in particular you and i were on this show probably over a year ago talking
[01:52:25.340 --> 01:52:30.340]  about apple laptops and somehow you and i had talked ourselves into thinking that the
[01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:36.860]  macbook pro was apple's most popular macbook uh and i think that we we unlike both of us
[01:52:36.860 --> 01:52:43.860]  i think had somehow really been thinking about people like us and the mac users of lore of
[01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:54.860]  your um and really lost touch of how big apple has grown in the mass market and and you know
[01:52:54.860 --> 01:52:58.500]  like i heard you probably heard the same thing but i heard from a bunch of people that work
[01:52:58.500 --> 01:53:04.180]  in apple stores you know you and jason are not like it's it's all macbook airs i could
[01:53:04.180 --> 01:53:07.300]  you know people who work in the app and the apple store said that they go all day and
[01:53:07.300 --> 01:53:11.440]  sell nothing but macbook airs and and this was a year ago and i don't know that that's
[01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:17.100]  changed and i think a big part of it i think a big part of it it's fundamentally price
[01:53:17.100 --> 01:53:23.140]  i think it's it's that there's an awful lot of people and in the old days price was never
[01:53:23.140 --> 01:53:26.940]  the top reason to buy apple stuff or never the top even if you were already going to
[01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:31.960]  buy apple stuff price was for most mac users wasn't the biggest driving factor obviously
[01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:37.060]  it's always been for some right there's some people who it's like i need a computer and
[01:53:37.060 --> 01:53:42.120]  i don't have a lot of money so i've kind of got to get the cheapest one i can get i mean
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:46.660]  that's of course that's true for everything right but it wasn't a huge segment of the
[01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:54.100]  mac market and apple's gotten so big and i think that the halo effect that you know people
[01:53:54.100 --> 01:53:59.460]  first started talking about with the ipod um i think the halo effect people don't use
[01:53:59.460 --> 01:54:05.300]  that term anymore but i think the halo effect of the iphone is simply unfathomable i think
[01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:08.620]  the number of people who because they're going to get a phone no matter what and they had
[01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:11.980]  some other phone and then they got an iphone and they're like you know what this is better
[01:54:11.980 --> 01:54:16.360]  i like this better this is nicer next time i buy a laptop i'm getting an apple laptop
[01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:21.180]  i'm done with it i really i but then they look at the prices and then they look at the
[01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:26.140]  prices and they're like wow and they're like i guess i'll get this 999 one you know right
[01:54:26.140 --> 01:54:31.180]  because 999 is not a cheap laptop but it is that's the buy-in for the apple platform and
[01:54:31.180 --> 01:54:37.720]  i so i do think it's price um and the other thing my my theory anyway is that we're in
[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:41.620]  an interesting place where a lot of the features that apple is using to differentiate the higher
[01:54:41.620 --> 01:54:46.760]  end laptops people a lot of the people who care about price just don't either don't care
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:51.560]  about them or don't care about them enough or in some cases it's a liability like and
[01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:56.000]  i've given advice to people about what what laptop should i buy what new mac laptop should
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:02.420]  i buy and i always have to like disclaim with like the macbook that it's not just 300 more
[01:55:02.420 --> 01:55:06.580]  than the macbook air but you're gonna have to buy a bunch of adapters because it's it's
[01:55:06.580 --> 01:55:11.060]  using usb-c so like if you don't care about retina a lot of us really care about retina
[01:55:11.060 --> 01:55:15.580]  there are a lot of people who don't care they they they'll either they or don't notice like
[01:55:15.580 --> 01:55:21.740]  one of one of the two so so yeah 300 more but it's got retina they don't care usb-c
[01:55:21.740 --> 01:55:25.420]  potentially a liability more than an asset because it's a lot of adapters for the stuff
[01:55:25.420 --> 01:55:29.900]  that they've got um having a magsafe connector that is super convenient and charges your
[01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:34.540]  computer without taking up either a hundred percent of the ports if you buy a macbook
[01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:41.100]  or half the ports if you buy the 1299 macbook pro without touch bar like magsafe's better
[01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:46.140]  the keyboard is i would argue better on the old macbook air but even if you like the new
[01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:51.900]  keyboard you can't argue that the new keyboard wouldn't be a dramatic like adaptation for
[01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:55.820]  somebody who's used to the old keyboards has an old apple laptop so you go into the store
[01:55:55.820 --> 01:55:59.140]  and you type on the new keyboard and you type on the macbook air and you're like oh i just
[01:55:59.140 --> 01:56:02.380]  want the thing that i already know and at that point like you've got like a whole bunch
[01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:07.520]  of reasons that are viewed from apple standpoint are like technology advancements which is
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:15.780]  why this product costs more and the people who are shopping say no none of those things
[01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:19.700]  is an advancement and certainly not enough of an advancement for me to spend an extra
[01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:24.980]  300 bucks so i'll just take the macbook air yeah i think that's it i think you made a
[01:56:24.980 --> 01:56:29.260]  good point i mean you're not the first i mean it's i think and but as time goes on i'm working
[01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:33.820]  more convinced of it i mean i don't think there's any way to argue that uh that the
[01:56:33.820 --> 01:56:41.100]  loss of magsafe isn't a overall step backwards i i think magsafe is better than usb or whatever
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:45.140]  you call it and i was going to say usb-c but is that what it is i don't know there's that
[01:56:45.140 --> 01:56:52.600]  yeah usb-c uh and i you know there are some can it's it there are trade-offs you know
[01:56:52.600 --> 01:57:03.900]  uh on uh the accidental tiff podcast last week uh i think casey uh um what's his last name uh
[01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:09.740]  i think he just goes by uh blister bliss yeah blister blister right uh he's our buddy blister
[01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:14.460]  yeah i wanted to know if he spelled it with two s's because that's what i assumed because he's
[01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:22.620]  i think i think that's even worse it's right there oh poor casey uh but anyway he mentioned
[01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:30.460]  that while they were recording the show he was recording using uh his little tiny macbook and
[01:57:30.460 --> 01:57:35.740]  he needed to power up his switch and he could just unplug the macbook's usb-c and then use that to
[01:57:35.740 --> 01:57:40.380]  charge up an underpowered switch it's convenient it's convenient to have multiple devices that
[01:57:40.380 --> 01:57:48.940]  use the same thing and only the macbook uses uh the the uh magsafe but uh the fact that the magsafe
[01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:56.540]  is magsafe and can just be pulled out is tremendous and i love i love the the indicator
[01:57:56.540 --> 01:58:03.100]  light i i really right i love the indicator light and it just every once in a while it happens where
[01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:09.500]  like a plug isn't in the wall right or you've plugged it into a wall socket that happens to
[01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:14.940]  be hooked up to a light switch and so it's not getting power and you get this instant feedback
[01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:21.420]  of yes it's charging because if you're like packing to go on a trip tomorrow and you're
[01:58:21.420 --> 01:58:25.580]  like all right let me charge my macbook and you don't even open it up and you just plug it in
[01:58:26.380 --> 01:58:32.220]  it is really reassuring to me to see that uh that orange light come on to say yes it is soaking up
[01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:37.420]  power and i can just walk away and pack my away suitcase uh that i've pulled out from under my
[01:58:37.420 --> 01:58:43.420]  bed with a casper mattress on it exactly know that when i go back to that macbook in the morning that
[01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:50.940]  it's fully charged and you know it it it it's a cool thing and i'm not and i'm not arguing that
[01:58:50.940 --> 01:58:55.260]  like i mean i think it is arguable but it's like that's the thing is it's arguable and i'm not
[01:58:55.260 --> 01:59:00.220]  saying that people don't see the value of these new tech things like apple does because i think
[01:59:00.220 --> 01:59:04.940]  people do the macbook is selling the macbook pros are selling they are selling pretty well
[01:59:04.940 --> 01:59:12.140]  but the macbook air is also selling right and i and like those people don't seem to be you know
[01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:17.420]  those are the people who are not convinced that it's worth an extra 300 for these other features
[01:59:17.420 --> 01:59:21.660]  and so my my overall question is like okay we got this report that there's going to be an update
[01:59:21.660 --> 01:59:25.500]  we all would have bet money that the macbook air would have been discontinued probably like a year
[01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:31.500]  ago or gone education maybe gone education only at a lower price right right but instead it's
[01:59:31.500 --> 01:59:37.340]  still kicking around because i think they can't take they can't take it off right and it obviously
[01:59:37.340 --> 01:59:42.060]  is making uh the margins on it have to be great the margins are off is obviously great on the
[01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:50.860]  macbook and the the macbook pro so um i wonder like what's the end game here and and do they
[01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:56.780]  do they finally give up and make like a retina laptop that's sub a thousand do they just keep
[01:59:56.780 --> 02:00:02.140]  this thing around i i legitimately wonder at what point they can't sell a fifth generation intel
[02:00:02.140 --> 02:00:07.180]  processor anymore and that's that's the thing that is in the back of my mind is like if i was apple
[02:00:07.180 --> 02:00:12.300]  and i didn't want to put any real work into like building a new macbook air enclosure because in
[02:00:12.300 --> 02:00:18.220]  the long run this this is all going to go away but i need to keep selling it maybe we design a new
[02:00:18.220 --> 02:00:23.340]  you know a new motherboard that fits in the same space as the old motherboard but uses the seventh
[02:00:23.340 --> 02:00:28.540]  generation intel and we process keep it alive we don't even announce it in an event we just
[02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:33.820]  it just suddenly we know it's just new processors in the macbook air it continues to be 999 goodbye
[02:00:33.820 --> 02:00:39.260]  like that's it literally like they did when they used the the most recent fifth generation one they
[02:00:39.260 --> 02:00:44.380]  could when they did the speed bump last year and then and then just walk away maybe they would do
[02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:50.220]  that but it's still like super weird that they're keeping this old laptop that looks nothing like
[02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:56.380]  any of their other laptops so that's weird the other weird thing is it just keeps bringing back
[02:00:56.380 --> 02:01:01.420]  how strange it is that there's this macbook pro that's not like the other macbook pros it's using
[02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:08.460]  the 15 watt processor that the macbook air uses it's using that that no touch bar macbook pro
[02:01:08.460 --> 02:01:15.500]  it's three pounds it's it's 20 grams it's less than an ounce heavier than the macbook air it's
[02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:21.740]  a little bit thicker on the than the thin side but thinner than the thick side of the macbook air 13
[02:01:21.740 --> 02:01:27.900]  inch it's so clearly a macbook air in anything but name maybe that and they've already dropped
[02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:34.060]  the price 200 on it so maybe that one keeps going down and eventually becomes the replacement for
[02:01:34.060 --> 02:01:39.500]  the macbook air why it's called a macbook pro i still don't entirely understand that seemed
[02:01:39.500 --> 02:01:44.780]  always seemed weird that they have like one of these things is not like the other but that's
[02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:49.660]  that's where we are so like i just don't know what the end game is could they sell it under a
[02:01:49.660 --> 02:01:56.220]  different name other than macbook pro even if it is form factor wise let's say while while closed
[02:01:56.220 --> 02:02:01.340]  and you can't see whether it has a touch bar or not identical to the macbook pro like is that it
[02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:06.860]  that they didn't want to make another new form factor uh i don't know because the marketing is
[02:02:06.860 --> 02:02:13.340]  so confusing i mean it's it's i mean it's i don't have you know not working at apple i don't
[02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:16.860]  actually have any responsibility for the margins and things like that so it's easy for me to say
[02:02:16.860 --> 02:02:21.260]  this but i'm gonna say this anyway which is i kind of feel like that's the macbook air and
[02:02:21.260 --> 02:02:27.100]  that maybe what they ought to do is just cut its price to 999 maybe by decontenting it a little
[02:02:27.100 --> 02:02:31.820]  bit you know microsoft did that with the surface uh the the surface book where they basically made
[02:02:31.820 --> 02:02:37.660]  a 999 version that's kind of lousy in terms of the specs but it gets them under a thousand
[02:02:37.660 --> 02:02:42.860]  and just say hey this is the macbook air now and let the old one go away i don't think they'll
[02:02:42.860 --> 02:02:48.460]  actually do that because they would be giving away an awful lot of margin but at the same time like
[02:02:48.460 --> 02:02:54.380]  that would be a modern laptop it is basically the 13-inch air it weighs the same it looks the same
[02:02:54.380 --> 02:02:59.420]  but it's got the retina screen and all of that like instead of the macbook which like you pay
[02:02:59.420 --> 02:03:04.940]  a premium for but it's like super thin and light i could see why you pay a premium for that but not
[02:03:04.940 --> 02:03:09.500]  for that macbook pro that is like it's literally the processors that the macbook air should be
[02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:14.300]  using it's the weight of the macbook air it's just called macbook pro right same footprint
[02:03:15.340 --> 02:03:21.100]  yeah it's it the naming thing is actually the part that it's it it it's not like they pick bad names
[02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:26.940]  every step of the way it's that the way that everything evolved wound up with the names being
[02:03:26.940 --> 02:03:33.820]  all messed up where the product that's just called the macbook with no adjective after it
[02:03:33.820 --> 02:03:43.100]  is it's not premium priced but it is also not sub 1000 and it's also limited in certain ways because
[02:03:43.100 --> 02:03:49.100]  it only has one port and so and right ben it is strikingly small and lightweight and thin
[02:03:50.460 --> 02:03:56.380]  and the product that's called the macbook air which implies that it's lightweight is way thicker
[02:03:56.380 --> 02:04:02.860]  and heavier than the just plain macbook but it literally is the just plain macbook if you tell
[02:04:02.860 --> 02:04:09.100]  a regular person i gotta uh yeah i'm gonna switch to a macbook right what is the default what is the
[02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:13.820]  the most common device that they sell the most common macbook that they sell and what's the one
[02:04:13.820 --> 02:04:19.260]  that you see everywhere and what are the features of this well i don't know a couple of regular usb
[02:04:19.260 --> 02:04:26.940]  ports and a magsafe and uh you know it it's familiar it is the macbook right the macbook
[02:04:26.940 --> 02:04:34.940]  should be the macbook air because it's thin and light and aggressively so and um the macbook air
[02:04:34.940 --> 02:04:39.420]  should be called the macbook so well i thought that's what it should be that that's you know
[02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:44.060]  you just you just nailed it which is what we all thought this would go to and it's still like
[02:04:44.060 --> 02:04:48.940]  i it just it i think the margins and the cost of the products have precluded this is like
[02:04:48.940 --> 02:04:57.900]  the macbook should be 999 the macbook pro 13-inch escape no touch bar should be the macbook right
[02:04:57.900 --> 02:05:03.820]  like the the macbook and should probably be what it is now which is 1299 and then there should be
[02:05:03.820 --> 02:05:08.940]  the macbook pro above it but in and that that 12-inch macbook could be the macbook air right
[02:05:08.940 --> 02:05:13.340]  like that that's sort of what we kind of felt was happening here and it just hasn't happened
[02:05:13.340 --> 02:05:17.580]  and i mean maybe there's somebody at apple who runs the numbers and says why would we
[02:05:17.580 --> 02:05:25.580]  cut our margins by 200 on the macbook when we make you know every one of those sales we lose
[02:05:25.580 --> 02:05:31.500]  we're making to the air where our margins might even be better like i i can see how it works math
[02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:37.020]  wise it's just at some point product line wise it's it just gets weirder and weirder the longer
[02:05:37.020 --> 02:05:42.860]  we go that a laptop that was designed like six years ago is still being sold brand new and and
[02:05:42.860 --> 02:05:49.020]  and that has this name that implies something about it then in light lightest yeah and it's
[02:05:49.020 --> 02:05:54.220]  a pound heavier than the lightest when it makes yeah when in in reality it's literally the most
[02:05:54.220 --> 02:05:59.900]  generic macbook you can imagine it's what people are familiar with and and functionally and and
[02:05:59.900 --> 02:06:04.140]  weight wise and everything it is it's just everything is like well that's like the baseline
[02:06:05.260 --> 02:06:11.580]  it's a very strange situation it's really strange and i think it's been lost a little bit like the
[02:06:11.580 --> 02:06:17.660]  macbook air's odd place in the lineup and and uncertain future has been lost a little bit with
[02:06:17.660 --> 02:06:22.620]  all of us talking so much about whether our keys are getting stuck on the new keyboards and the
[02:06:22.620 --> 02:06:28.300]  you know macbook pro which is still an issue but and the fact that it exists as the air and the
[02:06:28.300 --> 02:06:33.260]  macbook is not called a macbook air suggests to me that they're trying to phase out like the whole
[02:06:33.260 --> 02:06:37.660]  idea was they're phasing it out it won't be around long and then the names will make sense again
[02:06:37.660 --> 02:06:43.180]  there'll be macbook and macbook pro except they're not phasing it out and maybe they're updating it
[02:06:43.180 --> 02:06:48.940]  which you know you got to think was never the plan like something happened and maybe it was
[02:06:48.940 --> 02:06:52.940]  unexpected demand maybe everybody at apple really thought everybody would just start buying the
[02:06:52.940 --> 02:07:01.900]  macbook and it didn't happen and they're not willing to make it 999 and so they got stuck here
[02:07:01.900 --> 02:07:06.780]  but something happened because i think i think the plan early on i don't know what was the deal with
[02:07:06.780 --> 02:07:11.100]  that 13-inch macbook pro i don't know i don't i can't understand that one at all but clearly the
[02:07:11.100 --> 02:07:16.780]  plan with the macbook was that it was going to be the floor and the macbook air would die and it you
[02:07:16.780 --> 02:07:23.100]  know they can't kill it it just it won't we can't miss it if it won't go away which is it just won't
[02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:28.540]  we won't die right and compare and contrast with the ipad lineup where there was an ipad air and
[02:07:28.540 --> 02:07:33.740]  it was a mega popular product and right much beloved and probably still in use by tens of
[02:07:33.740 --> 02:07:40.060]  millions of people because ipads just go and go and go until you finally drop it and shatter the
[02:07:40.060 --> 02:07:44.380]  glass i mean i i don't know of any ipad that's gone out of commission until until the glass
[02:07:44.380 --> 02:07:50.140]  breaks maybe like the very first couple of generation ones have been put on shelves but
[02:07:50.140 --> 02:07:55.980]  they last forever but there was an ipad air and they phased it out and rather than keep it around
[02:07:55.980 --> 02:08:03.980]  and sell at a lower price they created a new product right in the middle called ipad and it is
[02:08:03.980 --> 02:08:09.980]  just an ipad it is 9.7 inches which is what you think and it is pretty fast and zippy and
[02:08:10.940 --> 02:08:17.020]  uh then there's two ipad pros which cost more and they're way more powerful they're way faster and
[02:08:17.020 --> 02:08:24.540]  they uh support advanced things like the pencil uh makes sense that all makes all makes sense
[02:08:24.540 --> 02:08:28.940]  and if you know for whatever you know it seems like it's you know it's still hanging around
[02:08:28.940 --> 02:08:36.860]  still there there's the ipad mini which is mini and like the macbook air it feels like a product
[02:08:36.860 --> 02:08:44.940]  that apple just seems to want to disappear but hasn't quite disappeared yet yeah so ipad naming
[02:08:44.940 --> 02:08:51.660]  wise you know makes total sense you know yeah macbook naming doesn't really make a lot of sense
[02:08:51.660 --> 02:08:56.780]  anyway we'll see well i i really hope so i hope that they do something to to straighten this out
[02:08:57.660 --> 02:09:03.740]  yeah i i was looking at pcs that are priced like this and the fact is there are pcs spec'd like
[02:09:03.740 --> 02:09:11.340]  that 13 inch um macbook pro without touch bar that are like 800 bucks 700 bucks and they've got retina
[02:09:11.340 --> 02:09:17.420]  and they've got the seventh generation intel core processors they are that's that's what you can get
[02:09:17.420 --> 02:09:24.780]  for a you know premium ish pc laptop around a thousand bucks so i know that that would be hard
[02:09:24.780 --> 02:09:31.340]  for apple margin wise but how long can apple keep selling a non-retina macbook i mean at some point
[02:09:31.340 --> 02:09:36.140]  they just have to stop right maybe not yet i don't know i don't know but at some point it's like they're
[02:09:36.140 --> 02:09:41.980]  just gonna they're gonna have like a revolt from mac developers that they still have to keep making
[02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:47.900]  non-retina graphics i mean i guess it might be a while before you can assume that all retina
[02:09:47.900 --> 02:09:52.220]  non-retina max are out of use but as long as they're still selling them brand new today and
[02:09:52.220 --> 02:09:57.900]  it's a super popular product you know that that's years from now like yeah like it's not even on our
[02:09:57.900 --> 02:10:03.100]  horizon when you can ship a mac app that doesn't have doesn't assume support for retina graphics
[02:10:03.100 --> 02:10:09.740]  it's crazy all right anyway last topic of the show um i want to talk about this thing where there's
[02:10:09.740 --> 02:10:18.860]  there's been um uh to me a different public reaction here in the us uh to the school shooting
[02:10:18.860 --> 02:10:25.660]  in uh uh the parkland is the town and this name of the school is the other thing but in parkland
[02:10:25.660 --> 02:10:35.340]  florida and um there's been and and i'm trying to be delicate here um there has been a bizarre
[02:10:35.340 --> 02:10:43.420]  repetitive response to mass shootings here in the us in the last at least 10 years maybe a little
[02:10:43.420 --> 02:10:50.940]  bit longer where there's um every day that it happens it's a new sensation and everybody is
[02:10:50.940 --> 02:10:58.300]  caught up in oh my god what's happened and then the next day there's um there's talk uh from one
[02:10:58.300 --> 02:11:02.380]  side about we should we need to do something this is insane it keeps happening over and over again
[02:11:02.380 --> 02:11:09.340]  our gun laws are out of out of control and on the other side there are people offering thoughts and
[02:11:09.340 --> 02:11:15.100]  prayers which has finally become sort of it's not just like a few people saying hey you can't just
[02:11:15.100 --> 02:11:22.060]  keep offering thoughts and prayers and do not make any changes um and there's a different reaction
[02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:27.180]  this time collectively there the the people haven't forgotten in in in other incidents like
[02:11:27.180 --> 02:11:34.700]  this in recent last decade or so uh you know like a week later it's out of the news not forgotten
[02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:39.580]  per se uh not like it's nowhere like you can't pick up a copy of the new york times and not find
[02:11:39.580 --> 02:11:46.460]  an article about the week ago incident on page a18 or something um but it stayed on the front
[02:11:46.460 --> 02:11:52.220]  page this time and i think i i've all long held the optimistic view that that would have to happen
[02:11:52.220 --> 02:12:00.860]  eventually i'm a believer in straws that break camel's backs and i understand how when you're
[02:12:00.860 --> 02:12:09.820]  not quite near the back breaking point it feels like infinite straws won't break this camel's back
[02:12:09.820 --> 02:12:19.580]  like i get it um but i feel like this time we've we've cracked something um and one of the ways
[02:12:19.580 --> 02:12:30.460]  um and one of the ways that uh that this has uh manifested itself in the public discourse
[02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:40.300]  is loud and sustained calls for the nras the national rifle association for those of you
[02:12:40.300 --> 02:12:47.100]  outside the u.s that's a a gun lobbying group here in the u.s that is long pushed for
[02:12:47.100 --> 02:12:57.740]  exactly the sort of gun laws that we have where they advocate any and all guns being available
[02:12:57.740 --> 02:13:03.180]  to just about any and all americans under just about any and all circumstances they're an
[02:13:03.180 --> 02:13:08.700]  incredibly successful lobbying group because it's really hard to imagine that our gun laws could be
[02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:16.700]  any more in the direction of of uh more gun more types of guns and more guns being available than
[02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:22.620]  there are and so one of the controversies is that they run a thing called ed they call it nratv
[02:13:22.620 --> 02:13:29.740]  it's an app you can get and they produce a lot of video they produce tv shows uh so you could
[02:13:29.740 --> 02:13:37.500]  go like on apple tv and get the nrt nratv app and watch nras television programming um
[02:13:37.500 --> 02:13:43.580]  programming um it's very angry they're very angry people if you would like to get a taste of it
[02:13:44.300 --> 02:13:49.180]  i would like to suggest a segment and i believe you you're you found the link to this jason
[02:13:49.180 --> 02:13:54.460]  is that yeah that's right from from last week tonight with john oliver right so john oliver uh
[02:13:54.460 --> 02:13:59.260]  the host of last week tonight on hbo which is one of my favorite television shows every week great
[02:13:59.260 --> 02:14:05.580]  our whole family looks forward to it the three of us it's might might be number one rivaled only by
[02:14:05.580 --> 02:14:10.300]  saturday night live is the show that three of us like to watch together the most had a terrific
[02:14:10.300 --> 02:14:16.860]  segment about the nratv specifically and they you know did a deep dive and found a lot of footage
[02:14:16.860 --> 02:14:21.740]  and it is bizarre but i highly recommend whether you're inside or outside the us if you want to get
[02:14:21.740 --> 02:14:27.340]  an insight into the mindset of this organization and the people who support them i would recommend
[02:14:27.340 --> 02:14:36.140]  watching this video um it's it's bizarre uh to say the least so there's people calling for uh apple
[02:14:36.140 --> 02:14:43.100]  amazon like with the fire to to remove these apps from the store uh john oliver's show i don't want
[02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:49.020]  to spoil at all there's still much good stuff in it but he they did a segment where they were like
[02:14:49.020 --> 02:14:55.500]  they put up amazon apple and roku together and said you know you got to get rid of this nratv
[02:14:55.500 --> 02:15:04.300]  and then they cut cut to a picture of a guy who supposedly worked at roku a static that roku was
[02:15:04.300 --> 02:15:11.660]  put up on par with apple and amazon like we finally made it we've made it and i it cracked
[02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:15.980]  me up because i happened to know that roku probably i don't know about outselling amazon but i
[02:15:16.700 --> 02:15:21.580]  99 sure they might be number one in that market yeah i think they're number one in the market it's
[02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:27.980]  just to show you how that market is outside the mainstream that from the mainstream you know the
[02:15:27.980 --> 02:15:32.940]  the perspective of the comedy writers at uh last week tonight they're the one that's like who the
[02:15:32.940 --> 02:15:36.540]  hell are they and why are they up there with amazon and apple but anyway people are calling
[02:15:36.540 --> 02:15:43.020]  for them to remove this app from the store and uh i don't think it's any surprise to anybody who
[02:15:43.020 --> 02:15:49.100]  reads my site or listens to the show that uh i would be in favor of tightening uh gun legislation
[02:15:49.100 --> 02:15:56.220]  here in the us significantly um i i would not consider myself an extremist in this regard i
[02:15:56.220 --> 02:16:03.100]  am not in favor of anything like uh an outright confiscation or ban of all private gun ownership
[02:16:03.100 --> 02:16:07.820]  nowhere near that i don't want to really get into the politics of where i think gun laws should be
[02:16:07.820 --> 02:16:13.580]  let's just say i think they should be significantly tighter and that there are certain guns that are
[02:16:13.580 --> 02:16:21.100]  legal today that i believe should be illegal for anyone to own but that's my position um and so
[02:16:21.100 --> 02:16:27.980]  therefore i am a pretty much an opponent of the nra politically um yep but i do not believe in uh
[02:16:27.980 --> 02:16:35.420]  having uh groups that i'm in opposition to politically uh banned from app stores or from
[02:16:35.420 --> 02:16:43.820]  the web or etc i'm a a free speech a first amendment uh advocate and so i have mixed feelings
[02:16:43.820 --> 02:16:50.700]  about this because i feel like the nra is more than just a political opposition group i think
[02:16:50.700 --> 02:16:56.060]  that to some degree it is an end and here's the point where i mean maybe there are some people
[02:16:56.060 --> 02:17:02.460]  listening who are so far so good and they what i'm about to say in the next sentence might toe the
[02:17:02.460 --> 02:17:07.980]  line but i feel that it is perfectly reasonable in an unemotional sense to look at them and what
[02:17:07.980 --> 02:17:12.860]  they advocate and what they say in the aftermath of these events and the messages they promote on
[02:17:12.860 --> 02:17:22.220]  nratv and describe them as a death cult um yeah okay there comes the email did you see that
[02:17:22.220 --> 02:17:27.020]  picture of the people who were actually in like the the commitment ceremony with the bullet
[02:17:27.020 --> 02:17:33.340]  headbands and yes yeah carrying their guns and stuff that was that was super weird a purportedly
[02:17:33.340 --> 02:17:39.580]  piece is is really good because first off the thesis i mean again i'm spoiling the end a little
[02:17:39.580 --> 02:17:44.540]  bit but what he says is nratv is a kind of a curiosity in the grand scheme of things of what
[02:17:44.540 --> 02:17:50.700]  the nra does he likens it to a bull or notable a bear that is chase that is about to attack you
[02:17:50.700 --> 02:17:56.460]  it is charging you and it's got a funny little hat and you could talk about the hat and focus
[02:17:56.460 --> 02:18:03.820]  on the hat make fun of the hat because the hat's super weird and strange and wrong but his point is
[02:18:03.820 --> 02:18:08.460]  you probably should focus on the bear not the bear's hat and that this is a this is a distraction
[02:18:09.180 --> 02:18:16.620]  to the bigger issue of the place the nra uh exists in american political society where it has made
[02:18:16.620 --> 02:18:24.700]  any gun regulation of any kind a third rail for one of the two uh major parties that controls
[02:18:24.700 --> 02:18:30.060]  the levers of government and that that is the that is the bigger issue here and not the this
[02:18:30.060 --> 02:18:35.740]  stuff that's on nratv and i agree with that i'm with you i i think anything when when you like
[02:18:35.740 --> 02:18:39.100]  something you disagree with politically and you think yeah that should be banned all you have to
[02:18:39.100 --> 02:18:43.980]  do is imagine the people who disagree with you politically banning your thing right and it's a
[02:18:43.980 --> 02:18:48.700]  it's a it's not a great road to walk down i do think if you look at those clips there is an
[02:18:48.700 --> 02:18:54.620]  argument to be made and you know apple if you look at the app store guidelines you could there is an
[02:18:54.620 --> 02:19:00.620]  argument to be made that some of the stuff that they've done lately some of their promos some of
[02:19:00.620 --> 02:19:11.260]  their videos some of their social media posts you could argue that it's an advocacy for violence
[02:19:11.260 --> 02:19:18.380]  yes that it's making threats a lot of the dana lush videos where she says you know we're gonna
[02:19:18.380 --> 02:19:23.340]  take this country back and it's going to be the clenched fist of justice or whatever she says
[02:19:23.340 --> 02:19:28.460]  like you could argue i think i think that would be the claim if i was trying to make the argument at
[02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:33.180]  apple for kicking them off of our platform i think that's the argument i'd make is that this
[02:19:33.180 --> 02:19:40.460]  has gone beyond political speech and has become um you know violence and threatening imagery
[02:19:40.460 --> 02:19:46.220]  and that stuff is in not only is that stuff banned in the app store guidelines but there's also this
[02:19:46.220 --> 02:19:51.180]  you know we know it when we see it inappropriate clause that is essentially apples out to kick
[02:19:51.180 --> 02:19:55.900]  anything off their platform so i could see that argument i could also see the argument that says
[02:19:55.900 --> 02:20:01.660]  look this is a political organization that people don't like that's fine but unless they step over
[02:20:01.660 --> 02:20:05.420]  a certain line we're going to let political organizations advocate for their political
[02:20:05.420 --> 02:20:11.100]  beliefs on our platforms because we don't want to start picking uh you know winners and losers
[02:20:11.100 --> 02:20:17.740]  in terms of of politics and that's a it's just a difficult line because you know i'm sure the kkk
[02:20:17.740 --> 02:20:23.020]  would like a an apple tv app too and that's never going to happen so where do you draw the line with
[02:20:23.020 --> 02:20:29.020]  the nra um and it you know i don't know maybe it's also apple going to some somebody like the nra and
[02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:33.660]  saying um this is where we're drawing the line and some of the stuff that you've been doing is
[02:20:33.660 --> 02:20:38.860]  crossing the line so you can make a decision to be as john oliver put it kind of an infomercial
[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:43.420]  for the gun industry and we'll let you do that we'll have your reality shows where people are
[02:20:43.420 --> 02:20:49.820]  painting pictures by shooting at buckets of paint and it's weird it's super weird but you know
[02:20:49.820 --> 02:20:54.940]  whatever um and then there's is there some place where apple's going to draw the line and say you're
[02:20:54.940 --> 02:20:58.540]  you know the stuff that you're putting out that crosses this line we're not comfortable with
[02:20:58.540 --> 02:21:03.740]  having on our platform and it's a tough call i think because you don't want to just say we don't
[02:21:03.740 --> 02:21:12.140]  like their politics so you're out and i i think that uh in my opinion that the things shouldn't
[02:21:12.140 --> 02:21:19.340]  exist i do i i i don't think that the message that they're pushing is a healthy one and i
[02:21:19.340 --> 02:21:26.380]  don't think it's a sign of a healthy political viewpoint i think it's i it's gone far beyond
[02:21:26.380 --> 02:21:33.820]  advocating for um some form of personal gun ownership in the united states as a right and
[02:21:33.820 --> 02:21:39.500]  has entered something new and i really do think it is cult-like and unhealthy and not even really
[02:21:39.500 --> 02:21:44.220]  based in reality a lot of the ways and i think that on a lot of other issues a group with
[02:21:44.220 --> 02:21:51.900]  similarly extreme viewpoints would never make it onto the app store or to fire or to roku yep but
[02:21:52.540 --> 02:21:59.980]  but it's different and it matters that there's a large popular support for this not a majority
[02:21:59.980 --> 02:22:04.780]  i'm not saying it's i don't want to mistake what i mean by popular because one of the frustrations
[02:22:04.780 --> 02:22:13.500]  of of being on the we should tighten the gun laws in this country uh side of the argument is that
[02:22:13.500 --> 02:22:20.380]  they're you know depending on the exact issue and how you phrase it it's you know 60 to 70 of
[02:22:20.380 --> 02:22:27.020]  people agree with that it is but the other side that other 30 is enough that it makes a difference
[02:22:27.020 --> 02:22:33.100]  and that the the idealistic side of this of saying well this is a death cult and this is
[02:22:33.100 --> 02:22:38.060]  these people advocate you know have terrible responses even to these shootings they they
[02:22:38.060 --> 02:22:47.820]  should not be on apple tv or or amazon's you know fire um i get it idealistically i i actually agree
[02:22:47.820 --> 02:22:52.620]  with you but you can't be an id we don't live in an ideal world we live in a practical world and
[02:22:52.620 --> 02:23:04.540]  then in the practical world if apple and amazon and roku just nuke the nratv um uh app it would
[02:23:04.540 --> 02:23:09.100]  create such a backlash you know what i mean it would it would i think it would be counterproductive
[02:23:09.100 --> 02:23:14.460]  i think it would actually draw more attention to the nratv and it would it would it would it
[02:23:14.460 --> 02:23:22.620]  would further the nra's agenda than having the nratv app in the app store yeah i um i i think
[02:23:22.620 --> 02:23:27.580]  i agree with you i i i wouldn't i don't think i would go so far as to call it a call it a death
[02:23:27.580 --> 02:23:31.340]  cult i think one of the things about the nra is that it's a lobbying group for the gun industry
[02:23:31.340 --> 02:23:36.300]  and their ultimate goal is to sell more guns and they are also they're trying to create lots and
[02:23:36.300 --> 02:23:41.180]  lots of customers who want to buy lots and lots of guns and make it you know and and get their
[02:23:41.180 --> 02:23:46.460]  support in making it easy to sell guns and you know the nra used to advocate for responsible
[02:23:47.100 --> 02:23:50.540]  gun laws and that just they turned a corner at some point and they don't do that anymore and
[02:23:50.540 --> 02:23:55.580]  they've they've taken an extreme viewpoint which is you know which is fine because that is a it's
[02:23:55.580 --> 02:24:01.260]  still an allowable political viewpoint to have an extreme political viewpoint but it's a you know
[02:24:01.260 --> 02:24:07.900]  it's a tough it's a tough situation i would argue you know i'm a moderate person i am for a lot more
[02:24:07.900 --> 02:24:13.580]  gun regulation than we have now i grew up around guns i grew up in a rural area i don't particularly
[02:24:13.580 --> 02:24:19.660]  like them and i don't have them in my home and i don't ever want them in my home but i'm i'm
[02:24:19.660 --> 02:24:26.140]  familiar with them and i grew up in a home that had multiple firearms and you know the i look at
[02:24:26.140 --> 02:24:32.060]  this and i just think think about the others being on the other side of it because even though i
[02:24:32.060 --> 02:24:37.740]  don't agree with this either politically a lot of people on the other side of the fence would
[02:24:37.740 --> 02:24:43.500]  say that's an organization like planned parenthood is advocating the death of human beings because
[02:24:43.500 --> 02:24:50.140]  they have abortion services i don't agree with that at all but you start to say well if i can
[02:24:50.140 --> 02:24:54.780]  if i can turn that around and make this argument and say that apple should ban this too again i
[02:24:54.780 --> 02:25:00.460]  don't want to get into this kind of false like oh does apple you know what's what's right or wrong
[02:25:00.460 --> 02:25:05.180]  versus like does apple want to be the referee there that's the question that i want to ask
[02:25:05.180 --> 02:25:09.660]  because i i i have opinions about which one of those arguments is good and which one of those
[02:25:09.660 --> 02:25:13.660]  arguments is bad and i'm not going to make those arguments i'm going to say does apple want to be
[02:25:13.660 --> 02:25:18.940]  the judge in that does apple want to go down to that level because i'm pretty sure apple doesn't
[02:25:18.940 --> 02:25:25.020]  want to go down there at the same time apple probably doesn't want to have a lot of people
[02:25:25.020 --> 02:25:32.220]  furious at it because it's a channel for this stuff from the nra in the wake of all of these
[02:25:32.220 --> 02:25:36.780]  mass shootings that are happening in the us it's a it's a tough you gotta imagine can you have you
[02:25:36.780 --> 02:25:42.300]  thought about this there's gotta have been a conference call with roku apple amazon and youtube
[02:25:42.300 --> 02:25:47.020]  right like what are we gonna do about these guys well because because i think one of them is not
[02:25:47.020 --> 02:25:52.060]  going to make the decision i imagine that all of them are going to make unless that's collusion
[02:25:52.060 --> 02:25:56.780]  and they're not allowed to do that but i feel like somebody's got to be like what do you think
[02:25:56.780 --> 02:26:02.140]  like what are what should our policy be here because um they all are facing the exact same
[02:26:02.140 --> 02:26:07.740]  issue which is you know do you allow something like this on your platform or not and do you want
[02:26:07.740 --> 02:26:11.980]  to be does it open doors for you in terms of what you've got to say i mean apple does have an out
[02:26:11.980 --> 02:26:16.300]  apple literally can say if we don't like it we'll kick it off of our platform but do they want to go
[02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:19.660]  down that route or no i don't think so and the other thing too that i think is funny and it's
[02:26:19.660 --> 02:26:23.740]  just a side point because i think the bigger question is what should these companies do
[02:26:23.740 --> 02:26:28.940]  but you including google is to me the more interesting because i suspect that the number
[02:26:28.940 --> 02:26:34.940]  of people who watch this stuff on apple tv roku and fire is a lot smaller than the people who run
[02:26:34.940 --> 02:26:45.020]  into the nratv's short or more uh more inflammatory videos right on youtube right on youtube and on
[02:26:45.020 --> 02:26:50.140]  facebook that i mean the stuff on nratv john oliver makes it clear a lot of the stuff on
[02:26:50.140 --> 02:26:56.700]  nratv it's kind of weird yeah but it's just it's it is like infomercial level or it's real imagine
[02:26:56.700 --> 02:27:01.420]  a reality shows about shooting right or about buying antique guns they have an antiques road
[02:27:01.420 --> 02:27:06.540]  show kind of show they've got all these and it's and it's about shooting like that's the stuff
[02:27:06.540 --> 02:27:11.340]  that goes viral that really angers people is generally yeah it's stuff that's posted on twitter
[02:27:11.340 --> 02:27:16.060]  or it's posted on on their youtube channel right yeah so i think that you've got a that all needs
[02:27:16.060 --> 02:27:21.740]  to be part of the conversation too right so anyway long story short uh i don't think i
[02:27:21.740 --> 02:27:26.940]  think apple is doing the right thing here and i think it's i think it's i i i really think it
[02:27:26.940 --> 02:27:32.060]  would be helpful to the nra if they could say look at these companies they're they're against us too
[02:27:32.060 --> 02:27:37.180]  you know they're suppressing they're suppressing our rights right and i i agree well that's why i
[02:27:37.180 --> 02:27:41.420]  think that john oliver segment is so brilliant because not only does it kind of defang a lot
[02:27:41.420 --> 02:27:47.980]  of the this nra stuff as being sort of ridiculous like the details of what they're doing but i think
[02:27:47.980 --> 02:27:53.180]  the bear analogy is pretty good i gotta say which is the nra if you believe the nra is a major
[02:27:53.180 --> 02:27:59.820]  problem in american society and i think it is i think they've gone way way way too far um and
[02:27:59.820 --> 02:28:06.220]  that may be a colossal understatement but i'm just i'm just trying to be straight here um maybe
[02:28:06.220 --> 02:28:13.500]  worrying about whether they've got a a video channel on apples and amazon's uh boxes is not
[02:28:13.500 --> 02:28:19.580]  what you need to be worrying about like it's not the same as even as a company offering a discount
[02:28:19.580 --> 02:28:24.060]  to nra members this is like they're just it's just a conduit for their videos if they turn it
[02:28:24.060 --> 02:28:28.060]  off their videos will be somewhere else the people who are watching it are only the people who are
[02:28:28.060 --> 02:28:32.540]  really deep into that stuff anyway you're probably not going to change their minds anyway like there
[02:28:32.540 --> 02:28:37.580]  are bigger issues here there are bigger battles to fight than worrying about this funny hat that
[02:28:37.580 --> 02:28:43.900]  the bear that's charging at you is wearing yep uh so i will definitely put that uh john oliver clip
[02:28:43.900 --> 02:28:50.300]  in the show notes i really encourage you to watch it i i you know it's really well done and funny
[02:28:50.300 --> 02:28:56.540]  and and makes a point really good um i say we wrap it up right there it has been a fantastic
[02:28:56.540 --> 02:29:01.740]  conversation i i don't know that i've ever had an episode of this show this is episode 216 i believe
[02:29:01.740 --> 02:29:06.380]  i don't know if i ever had an episode that stuck more closely to the notes of the episode
[02:29:07.580 --> 02:29:10.860]  that was pretty good you do i was impressed you jumped around a little at one point and then
[02:29:10.860 --> 02:29:16.300]  you're like you're right on it but uh it's good uh everybody jason snell you can read his work
[02:29:16.300 --> 02:29:21.660]  on a daily basis at sixcolors.com and you can spell colors however you think it should be
[02:29:21.660 --> 02:29:29.260]  spelled and it will work within reason yeah and you can listen to his voice his melodious voice on
[02:29:29.260 --> 02:29:33.660]  several podcasts including upgrade which he mentioned with mike hurley and uh occasional
[02:29:33.660 --> 02:29:42.620]  guests download uh another another show on relay fm and uh the incomparable which has uh 72
[02:29:42.620 --> 02:29:47.580]  episodes a week i don't know that you're on every one of them but then the network has many many
[02:29:47.580 --> 02:29:54.540]  episodes the uh the the show itself is is only weekly fortunately for me uh now i'm looking at
[02:29:54.540 --> 02:29:58.460]  your list geez you got even more you're growing podcasts you got now you got more i'm looking tv
[02:29:58.460 --> 02:30:05.980]  talk machine with uh tim goodman uh chief tv critic of the hollywood reporter and liftoff
[02:30:05.980 --> 02:30:12.380]  oh my god with stephen hackett that's a fort what's fortnightly oh 14 14 every 14 days or 14
[02:30:12.380 --> 02:30:18.300]  nights it's fortnightly and free free free agents free agents with david sparks which is also every
[02:30:18.300 --> 02:30:23.420]  other week when people ask me how many podcasts i do these days i say well i do a lot but i cheat
[02:30:23.420 --> 02:30:27.340]  because like some of them are every other week and some of them like robot or not with john
[02:30:27.340 --> 02:30:33.660]  saracusa we record like 15 of them in 90 minutes and then i just spool those out over the next half
[02:30:33.660 --> 02:30:39.260]  a year so it's that's cheating it's not not really a lot of work for me to do some of those podcasts
[02:30:39.260 --> 02:30:43.180]  well my thanks to you thank you for your time and my thanks once again to our three sponsors
[02:30:43.180 --> 02:30:47.180]  we've got casper where you can buy mattresses and squarespace where you can get a website
[02:30:47.820 --> 02:30:53.500]  and a way where you can get a suitcase so my idea would be to start a blog where you blog about
[02:30:53.500 --> 02:31:00.380]  uh on squarespace where every post is about uh putting an away suitcase under your casper
[02:31:00.380 --> 02:31:23.660]  casper mattress bed there you go combine them all three good good plan all right i gotta go thank you jason
