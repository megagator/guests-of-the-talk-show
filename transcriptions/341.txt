[00:00.000 --> 00:04.060]  I never know where Caleb's going to jump in, but I presume it'll be around now.
[00:04.140 --> 00:08.740]  I do feel, I do feel it's very important that wherever we start to show it's my
[00:08.740 --> 00:13.180]  voice, because I do feel like if it's yours, half, at least half, that's true.
[00:13.200 --> 00:13.660]  That's true.
[00:14.300 --> 00:18.340]  At least half of our listeners are going to be confused and believe that they've
[00:18.340 --> 00:20.180]  screwed up take over John, right?
[00:20.400 --> 00:24.780]  Actually a fairly large segment of them will probably would, would, if your voice
[00:24.780 --> 00:30.020]  came first, probably think it was due to a bug in overcast media.
[00:31.460 --> 00:31.940]  It's true.
[00:33.020 --> 00:33.900]  Um, all right.
[00:33.900 --> 00:36.400]  So yeah, you can lead in however you would like.
[00:36.400 --> 00:41.460]  I mean, uh, the airing is a stretch, but, but no, I think I have a little something
[00:41.460 --> 00:44.540]  to warm us up, but if, however you want to lead in, I'm happy to roll with.
[00:45.260 --> 00:46.780]  Oh, I figured we're already rolling.
[00:47.460 --> 00:48.200]  Oh, okay.
[00:48.240 --> 00:49.160]  Oh, well, here we go.
[00:49.220 --> 00:51.060]  Well, whatever's in the show is in the show.
[00:51.140 --> 00:51.980]  Tell me your story.
[00:52.540 --> 00:52.820]  Okay.
[00:52.820 --> 00:57.740]  So I was thinking about how, you know, we've known each other, uh, for a fair bit
[00:57.740 --> 01:01.780]  of time now, probably about 10 years now, I would say, and, and I like to think of
[01:01.780 --> 01:05.160]  us as friends and I was thinking about why is it that, you know, I haven't been
[01:05.160 --> 01:08.820]  asked to be on the talk show and it occurred to me early on when I started
[01:08.820 --> 01:12.820]  following your work, you know, I remember hearing you talk about the three keys to
[01:12.820 --> 01:15.500]  success, and this is off the top of my head, so I might be flubbing it, but I
[01:15.500 --> 01:20.740]  believe the three keys to success as a, as a blogger or an independent person is,
[01:20.740 --> 01:24.700]  and jumping when you're ready, John, fussy coffee, a clickety keyboard,
[01:24.700 --> 01:29.260]  clickety-clackety keyboard, and just obscenely carbonated water.
[01:29.420 --> 01:33.900]  And it occurred to me that I don't personally care for any of those things,
[01:33.900 --> 01:34.900]  but I thought, you know what?
[01:35.380 --> 01:37.380]  I don't know if that's the actual issue here.
[01:37.820 --> 01:42.300]  I think the actual issue here might be that in, in, I haven't had the pleasure
[01:42.300 --> 01:45.780]  of catching a drink with you or your delightful wife, Amy Jane, in far too
[01:45.780 --> 01:49.980]  long, but if I recall correctly, you are a gin martini kind of guy.
[01:49.980 --> 01:53.020]  And I am not, and I was wondering, John, if this is the
[01:53.020 --> 01:54.500]  crux of the disagreement here.
[01:56.140 --> 01:57.060]  That's a good opening.
[01:57.100 --> 02:02.300]  It is, and in no particular order in, in HTML parlance, it's an unordered list.
[02:03.860 --> 02:07.340]  Fussy coffee, extremely carbonated water, and a clicky keyboard.
[02:07.420 --> 02:09.660]  I do enjoy a gin martini.
[02:09.660 --> 02:11.380]  I think you are misremembering now.
[02:11.580 --> 02:12.180]  Oh, okay.
[02:12.180 --> 02:16.980]  So I'm, I am, I forget how you put it in religious terms.
[02:16.980 --> 02:20.740]  I'm going, I was going to say agnostic, but there's a better word
[02:20.740 --> 02:25.140]  and it's not coming to mind, but I am the rare person who, who is an
[02:25.140 --> 02:30.860]  aficionado and greatly enjoy a very nice, very cold martini before a nice meal.
[02:30.900 --> 02:35.620]  But I will accept both gin and vodka martini.
[02:36.020 --> 02:44.740]  The, but the issue is that Amy does not care for gin and, uh, therefore I just
[02:44.740 --> 02:48.620]  generally let her order first and then I say, I'll have what she's having.
[02:48.620 --> 02:51.460]  So as to avoid any chance of any confusion, because I don't care.
[02:52.980 --> 02:56.380]  Now this drives the gin martini people nuts.
[02:56.540 --> 03:02.700]  You know, the gin martini people are like the Catholics because no, this is true.
[03:02.820 --> 03:03.700]  It is true.
[03:03.700 --> 03:07.580]  It's they're, they're like the Catholics because that was the original.
[03:07.580 --> 03:12.180]  That's the old school, they're angrier and you know, the, their big thing.
[03:12.180 --> 03:15.300]  And they're already at the people out there who are listening, who are, who
[03:15.300 --> 03:18.980]  believe that a martini should only be made with gin will also say that you
[03:18.980 --> 03:22.260]  don't have, there is no such thing as a quote unquote, gin martini, that a
[03:22.260 --> 03:29.060]  martini by definition is an only made with gin, not vodka and that a vodka
[03:29.060 --> 03:31.980]  martini, they won't, they, they won't even, they don't even like it when you
[03:31.980 --> 03:33.900]  say vodka martini as a separate drink.
[03:33.900 --> 03:36.820]  They like to say that it's called, I forget, there's a name.
[03:36.820 --> 03:37.980]  Oh yes.
[03:37.980 --> 03:40.260]  I know what you're thinking of and I can't remember what it is either now.
[03:40.260 --> 03:44.340]  Yeah, but from their perspective, it might as well be called a stinky head.
[03:44.380 --> 03:49.380]  You know, I will, I will enjoy both.
[03:49.380 --> 03:51.220]  I believe, you know, I'm open-minded.
[03:51.220 --> 03:52.980]  There is, I hope it's still available.
[03:52.980 --> 03:54.780]  I will, I'm making a note right now.
[03:54.780 --> 03:59.180]  I swear to God in the show notes, there is a wonderful, wonderful website
[03:59.180 --> 04:06.940]  called the martini FAQ and it is, it's so old school internet.
[04:07.020 --> 04:09.140]  I know I've linked to it from daring fireball at least once.
[04:09.140 --> 04:13.940]  I hope it's still online, but it is written by someone who I believe is much
[04:13.940 --> 04:20.540]  more of a gin martini aficionado than vodka, but he keeps, he's, he has a very
[04:20.540 --> 04:24.900]  open mind about the whole, the whole thing and gets into also the other
[04:24.900 --> 04:30.260]  religious aspect of how much, how much vermouth should be put into a martini.
[04:30.580 --> 04:35.900]  So your answer is, I'm a Churchill man that you should pick up a bottle of
[04:35.900 --> 04:38.020]  vermouth and wave it in the direction of Italy.
[04:38.020 --> 04:41.620]  That is exactly the right answer in my personal opinion.
[04:41.620 --> 04:43.940]  Just, just get it somewhere near the shaker.
[04:43.940 --> 04:45.380]  And I am satisfied with that.
[04:45.940 --> 04:49.380]  You probably know this cause you've been with us and you've met my wife and,
[04:49.420 --> 04:51.820]  but she, she is, I'm not making this up.
[04:51.820 --> 04:53.780]  She is a vodka supertaster.
[04:55.060 --> 04:55.980]  Ah, interesting.
[04:55.980 --> 04:56.220]  Okay.
[04:56.220 --> 04:57.740]  So what is her vodka of choice then?
[04:57.780 --> 04:59.420]  Belvedere and Grey Goose.
[04:59.540 --> 05:01.060]  She, she, she likes both.
[05:01.100 --> 05:04.420]  She does not care for yours, which is Tito's.
[05:04.420 --> 05:09.220]  She does not care for kettle one at all, which she believes tastes Tito's like.
[05:09.260 --> 05:14.740]  And she also, you know, and what she, like, cause you can go somewhere
[05:14.740 --> 05:18.300]  and you'll say like, I would like a Belvedere martini up with a twist.
[05:18.860 --> 05:20.420]  And it should be made with Belvedere.
[05:20.420 --> 05:23.980]  And then, you know, occasionally at a lesser establishment, they might make it
[05:23.980 --> 05:27.380]  with, you know, they might just tell the bartender vodka martini, and then
[05:27.380 --> 05:28.740]  they make it with something else.
[05:29.300 --> 05:32.660]  And she, she, she'll take one sip and then she'll take another sip.
[05:32.660 --> 05:36.180]  She, she, she'll take one sip and just say, ah, jet fuel.
[05:38.300 --> 05:39.460]  See, that's me with gin.
[05:39.460 --> 05:44.220]  And I was hoping as much as I'm snarking on, on the gin believers, but I was
[05:44.220 --> 05:47.540]  hoping you could maybe teach me either verbally or the next time we have the
[05:47.540 --> 05:50.500]  pleasure of being around each other, teach me how to like gin, cause it
[05:50.500 --> 05:53.620]  tastes like grass to me, like I just, I can't do it.
[05:53.620 --> 05:58.940]  It's just, I find it so, so gross and I want to be able to like it.
[05:58.940 --> 06:03.740]  I want to be more ambivalent about the particular kind of martini I'm having.
[06:03.740 --> 06:10.940]  And so I have the desire, but I don't yet have the skill to consume a gin martini.
[06:10.940 --> 06:12.300]  And maybe one day I'll get there.
[06:12.580 --> 06:14.500]  That seems to be the argument.
[06:14.540 --> 06:16.740]  You know, again, I'm not religious about it.
[06:16.740 --> 06:18.220]  You know, have what you like.
[06:18.260 --> 06:19.580]  Oh, the martini fact is still up.
[06:19.860 --> 06:20.300]  Thank God.
[06:20.580 --> 06:23.620]  I will absolutely 100% put this in the show notes.
[06:23.620 --> 06:26.340]  No, no joke about it because it's so wonderful.
[06:26.340 --> 06:30.100]  I hesitate even to link it to you now in the chat because you'll,
[06:30.100 --> 06:31.820]  you'll become consumed by it.
[06:31.820 --> 06:33.820]  It's so, so you'll have to wait.
[06:34.340 --> 06:38.020]  No, but the basic argument from the gin aficionados is that gin, gin is a
[06:38.020 --> 06:40.180]  flavorful, what would you call it?
[06:40.180 --> 06:43.300]  A beverage, a spirit, a spirit, a spirit.
[06:43.300 --> 06:43.740]  That's it.
[06:43.780 --> 06:48.980]  And vodka deliberately is sort of anti-flavorful, you know, to me, I've
[06:48.980 --> 06:54.500]  often described a perfect vodka martini as tasting like an ice cold cloud.
[06:54.500 --> 06:55.780]  Very, very well put.
[06:55.780 --> 06:56.180]  I agree.
[06:57.060 --> 06:57.740]  No, I don't know.
[06:57.740 --> 07:01.780]  I, I, I honestly, the reason you haven't been on the show is I forget, I forget
[07:01.780 --> 07:02.100]  about you.
[07:02.940 --> 07:03.860]  That's that's okay.
[07:03.900 --> 07:07.100]  I, I, I serve that role and I serve it proudly.
[07:07.100 --> 07:08.420]  So that is no problem at all.
[07:08.460 --> 07:08.700]  Really.
[07:08.700 --> 07:10.300]  That was just an excuse to talk about martinis.
[07:10.300 --> 07:16.700]  Cause I feel like we need, it's, it's talk show, like rules that we talk about
[07:16.700 --> 07:18.300]  something completely unrelated to tech.
[07:18.540 --> 07:22.460]  I did go see a baseball game last summer, so we can fulfill the baseball quota.
[07:22.460 --> 07:25.940]  If you'd like very quickly, but I don't have a lot to say about baseball.
[07:25.940 --> 07:29.420]  So I was trying to find some common ground that we could work, work through
[07:29.420 --> 07:30.260]  that isn't tech.
[07:30.940 --> 07:34.340]  Well, we have so much we could do, we could do clicky keyboards.
[07:34.340 --> 07:37.780]  I'm back on my Apple extended keyboard too.
[07:37.820 --> 07:42.140]  Now you might've seen this we're on at least one Slack together, but I haven't
[07:42.140 --> 07:45.620]  been using an external cause we want to talk one of the things I'll spoiler here.
[07:45.620 --> 07:47.500]  We're going to talk about the Apple studio display.
[07:48.020 --> 07:48.980]  We could get into it.
[07:48.980 --> 07:53.260]  But one of the other things that I do I kid, I kid about forgetting about you,
[07:53.260 --> 07:56.860]  but one of the things that I sympathize with is that your vision is less than
[07:56.860 --> 08:03.980]  perfect and oftentimes, you know, and I think Marco, I think as far as pretty
[08:03.980 --> 08:08.700]  good vision for his age and maybe, maybe Syracuse is in the middle, but oftentimes
[08:08.700 --> 08:12.140]  when talking about things that you can notice visually, et cetera, you know, I
[08:12.140 --> 08:13.540]  sympathize and that's part of it.
[08:13.540 --> 08:19.300]  But long story short, I, from, I always forget that this is one of those things
[08:19.300 --> 08:21.020]  as you get older, the years blur together.
[08:21.020 --> 08:28.340]  I forget if my iMac 5k was a 2014 or 2015 purchase, I'm going to say 2015, but from
[08:28.340 --> 08:35.020]  2015 until like July, 2019, my desktop computer was an iMac 5k.
[08:35.060 --> 08:42.020]  So I'm very familiar with the 5k 27 inch, you know, display panel and my keyboard
[08:42.020 --> 08:47.620]  was my beloved Apple extended keyboard to hooked up, you know, through an ADB to
[08:47.620 --> 08:48.420]  USB adapter.
[08:48.780 --> 08:55.340]  I forget what happened first, but at the end of 2019, we had some renovations at
[08:55.340 --> 09:01.340]  the house, including completely renovating my office, which before renovation was
[09:01.340 --> 09:05.620]  really just a room with white walls and nothing in it and just a desk in the
[09:05.620 --> 09:11.300]  corner and actually was sort of our depot for a bunch of boxes that we didn't
[09:11.300 --> 09:13.700]  never finished moving when we moved into this place.
[09:13.700 --> 09:16.260]  It was really, it did not look like an office.
[09:16.260 --> 09:20.740]  It looked like more like a basement somehow with windows, but we had a
[09:20.740 --> 09:25.260]  wonderful, we really, it's just a great experience and timed perfectly before it,
[09:25.260 --> 09:29.500]  they finished up literally just by coincidence, right before the unfortunate
[09:29.500 --> 09:31.420]  incidents of early 2020 hit.
[09:32.220 --> 09:36.620]  But I had to, while they were renovating, pack up everything, get out of my office
[09:36.620 --> 09:40.820]  so that they could build the nice office that I have now with built-in shelves and
[09:40.820 --> 09:48.660]  a built-in desk and if you've ever seen me on occasionally on CNBC or some sort
[09:48.660 --> 09:53.620]  of YouTube, like Renee's YouTube channel or something, there's these nice slatted
[09:53.660 --> 09:58.460]  walls along the one side or at my annual talk show from WWDC the last two years,
[09:58.460 --> 09:59.780]  which have been conducted remotely.
[09:59.780 --> 10:03.500]  It's, in my opinion, very nice looking office, but it had to be done.
[10:03.500 --> 10:06.260]  So I had to get out and so I packed up the iMac 5k.
[10:06.260 --> 10:10.900]  Well, shortly thereafter, at that point, I had my second retinal detachment in my
[10:10.900 --> 10:17.060]  other eye from my first one was back in, I believe, again, conflating 2014, 2015.
[10:17.700 --> 10:19.380]  I think 2014 or 2015.
[10:19.380 --> 10:25.380]  And the other problem I had, this is true, was in my good eye, which did not have a
[10:25.380 --> 10:28.100]  retinal detachment in August of 2019.
[10:28.220 --> 10:32.340]  I, that's the one that had a retinal detachment years before that was repaired
[10:32.340 --> 10:38.100]  wonderfully, and it truly put me into the 99th percentile of recovery from how bad
[10:38.100 --> 10:38.420]  it was.
[10:39.060 --> 10:40.580]  But I had a cataract.
[10:42.660 --> 10:44.820]  You've just had a series of hits when it comes to your eyes.
[10:44.820 --> 10:47.780]  It's, you know, and they're possibly related.
[10:47.780 --> 10:52.260]  There's some correlation between people who have cataracts at a bizarrely young
[10:52.260 --> 10:57.300]  age, because cataracts typically are only really a problem for people in their 70s
[10:57.300 --> 10:58.500]  and I was only in my 40s.
[10:58.500 --> 11:02.340]  Long story short, I needed to be very close to a screen to see it.
[11:02.340 --> 11:07.300]  And so I do, I forget what happened first, me packing up the iMac for the renovation
[11:07.300 --> 11:11.700]  or having a retinal detachment and in the aftermath of it while recovering, needing
[11:11.700 --> 11:15.620]  to be pretty close to a screen, like too close to use a desktop display anyway.
[11:15.700 --> 11:20.740]  So I have been, that's my way of saying due to vision problems and renovations and
[11:20.740 --> 11:29.940]  then covid using a MacBook Pro of some sort as my entire Macintosh since, like, the
[11:29.940 --> 11:31.220]  middle of 2019.
[11:31.220 --> 11:35.060]  In other words, I had no external display, no external keyboard, and haven't.
[11:35.060 --> 11:36.820]  And now my vision has gotten much better.
[11:36.820 --> 11:40.340]  And it's, you know, again, I don't want to go into the details of it, but my combined
[11:40.340 --> 11:42.420]  vision from the two eyes has really gotten better.
[11:42.420 --> 11:43.620]  It continues to improve.
[11:43.620 --> 11:50.820]  It's, and I can definitely use a 27-inch display in front of me and see it very well.
[11:50.820 --> 11:56.580]  But I didn't hook my iMac back up, like, and that's sort of like a 2021 thing where
[11:56.580 --> 11:58.900]  my vision got to that point where, hey, I can actually do this.
[11:58.900 --> 12:04.340]  Where I noticed it the first time was when I was testing, reviewing the iMac 24-inch
[12:04.340 --> 12:05.300]  last year.
[12:05.300 --> 12:07.780]  I was like, hey, crap, I can see this.
[12:07.780 --> 12:12.900]  This is actually, you know, that was the first, because I just don't see, you know,
[12:12.900 --> 12:14.260]  I don't go anywhere.
[12:14.260 --> 12:18.420]  It certainly didn't go anywhere during COVID, so it's like, you know, there was a while
[12:18.420 --> 12:23.780]  early on in the COVID time where I really just needed to be sort of hunched over and
[12:23.780 --> 12:26.500]  being closer to a MacBook screen to see it clearly.
[12:26.500 --> 12:27.620]  Then I tested that iMac.
[12:27.620 --> 12:31.380]  I was like, hey, if I use these glasses, I can see this just fine.
[12:31.380 --> 12:32.100]  This is great.
[12:32.100 --> 12:33.620]  But what was I going to do, right?
[12:33.620 --> 12:37.940]  Now, this leads us to the great external display dilemma of Mac users, right?
[12:37.940 --> 12:41.620]  I didn't want to buy a 24-inch iMac for myself.
[12:41.620 --> 12:45.380]  I wanted something bigger and better and really didn't want an iMac.
[12:45.380 --> 12:51.860]  I really wanted to go full on with a MacBook Pro as my one and only one true Mac and then
[12:51.860 --> 12:55.700]  have a standalone desktop display to connect it to.
[12:55.700 --> 12:58.020]  But what the hell was I going to buy a year ago?
[12:58.020 --> 13:00.500]  Yeah, and it was a mess.
[13:00.500 --> 13:01.300]  It was an absolute mess.
[13:01.300 --> 13:07.860]  And so my brief history with this was back in 2016, my last, you know, regular full-time
[13:07.860 --> 13:14.020]  job, I was doing iOS development for a local firm and I wanted to get one or more external
[13:14.020 --> 13:16.500]  monitors and I wanted something that is considered retina.
[13:16.500 --> 13:21.060]  And, you know, retina is kind of a marketing term and it means different things to different
[13:21.060 --> 13:22.660]  people depending on who you ask.
[13:22.660 --> 13:27.380]  But generally speaking, you know, in the history is, you know, from what was it, the iPhone
[13:27.380 --> 13:31.860]  4 where that went and it doubled the pixel density and Apple said, oh, look at this retina
[13:31.860 --> 13:32.420]  screen.
[13:32.420 --> 13:36.500]  And then it came to the MacBook Pro and eventually to the iMac.
[13:36.500 --> 13:39.060]  And well, actually the iMac Pro as well.
[13:39.060 --> 13:45.140]  So it's this idea that you basically get just incredibly, incredibly crisp displays by having
[13:45.140 --> 13:50.580]  just tremendous amount of resolution in a not tremendously oversized screen.
[13:50.580 --> 13:56.340]  And in 2017, I was looking for an external monitor and I started looking at, okay, what's
[13:56.340 --> 13:56.980]  available?
[13:56.980 --> 14:02.420]  And around the same time, Mark Edwards was looking into the same thing and he came up
[14:02.420 --> 14:04.180]  with kind of a list of options.
[14:04.180 --> 14:09.940]  And I went through his list and came to the conclusion that there's basically in 2017,
[14:09.940 --> 14:15.620]  there were only five options and it was the two LG Ultra finds, a couple of Dells and
[14:15.620 --> 14:19.140]  an LG, just unremarkable LG 4K monitor.
[14:19.140 --> 14:24.580]  And what I ended up doing was we tried at work, we tried to get one of these 5K Dells
[14:24.580 --> 14:27.940]  if memory serves and it arrived DOA for whatever reason.
[14:27.940 --> 14:29.220]  And so we said, ah, the heck with it.
[14:29.220 --> 14:30.580]  It was really expensive anyway.
[14:30.580 --> 14:35.380]  And so what we got, I ended up with one and then eventually a second, very unremarkable.
[14:35.380 --> 14:37.620]  It was like 300 bucks, 4K monitor.
[14:37.620 --> 14:40.900]  The LG 24UD58-B rolls right off the tongue.
[14:40.900 --> 14:44.020]  And so that was 2017, John.
[14:44.020 --> 14:45.380]  It's a wonderful name.
[14:45.380 --> 14:45.940]  It really is.
[14:45.940 --> 14:47.060]  It's just delightful.
[14:47.060 --> 14:50.420]  It's like, it's like, it's like LG outsourced their naming to Sony.
[14:51.140 --> 14:51.620]  Right.
[14:51.620 --> 14:52.260]  It's so true.
[14:52.260 --> 14:52.580]  Yeah.
[14:52.580 --> 14:52.980]  What is it?
[14:52.980 --> 14:56.820]  The WH345678910 or whatever that everyone loves the headphones.
[14:56.820 --> 14:57.940]  So that was 2017.
[14:57.940 --> 15:01.380]  And at that point at home, I had either an iMac or nine.
[15:01.380 --> 15:03.220]  I think it was a regular 5K iMac.
[15:03.220 --> 15:04.500]  Eventually I got the iMac Pro.
[15:05.140 --> 15:11.060]  And then in roughly November of last year, I decided to go all in on, on Apple Silicon.
[15:11.060 --> 15:16.340]  And I got an M1 Max, a 14 inch MacBook Pro, which I adore.
[15:16.340 --> 15:18.420]  I cannot tell you how much I love this thing.
[15:18.420 --> 15:22.500]  It is just one of the, if not the best computer I've ever owned in my life.
[15:22.500 --> 15:25.060]  But Hey, I'd like to hook it up something.
[15:25.060 --> 15:30.740]  So here it is in December of last year, I started surveying the situation again and
[15:30.740 --> 15:36.500]  I started looking around and I realized, well, Dell has discontinued their two reasonable
[15:36.500 --> 15:44.100]  monitors, which leaves us with the aforementioned 24UD58-B, which is the $300 4K LG, the LG
[15:44.100 --> 15:50.500]  Ultrafine 4K, the LG Ultrafine 5K, and the Pro Display XDR, which cost as much as my
[15:50.500 --> 15:51.220]  darn computer.
[15:51.220 --> 15:52.580]  And that's without a stand.
[15:52.580 --> 15:55.940]  And so it occurred to me like, this is a mess.
[15:55.940 --> 15:57.220]  This is an absolute mess.
[15:57.220 --> 16:04.660]  How is it that Apple is just completely ignoring consumer level needs in this regard?
[16:04.660 --> 16:06.260]  It just boggled my mind.
[16:06.260 --> 16:09.540]  And so I wrote a post about it, which you were kind enough to link to.
[16:09.540 --> 16:13.940]  And as of, you know, three weeks ago or whatever it was four weeks ago before the most recent
[16:13.940 --> 16:14.660]  event, that was it.
[16:14.660 --> 16:20.340]  It was a $300 LG, the $700 LG Ultrafine, which depending on who you ask, doesn't even qualify
[16:20.340 --> 16:20.900]  as Retina.
[16:20.900 --> 16:23.220]  I believe it does, but there's some nuance there.
[16:23.220 --> 16:28.820]  The LG Ultrafine, which is what I ended up getting secondhand, which is fine, and the
[16:28.820 --> 16:29.780]  Pro Display XDR.
[16:29.780 --> 16:30.100]  And that's it.
[16:30.100 --> 16:31.220]  That's all you had.
[16:31.220 --> 16:33.700]  And it was a disgrace.
[16:33.700 --> 16:37.220]  I mean, maybe I'm being a bit dramatic, but it was very, very frustrating.
[16:37.220 --> 16:40.820]  Which one did you just say some people say is Retina?
[16:41.380 --> 16:44.420]  So the LG Ultrafine 4K, there's a bit of a history here.
[16:44.420 --> 16:45.300]  How big is that?
[16:45.300 --> 16:46.820]  Is that 27 or 24?
[16:46.820 --> 16:47.940]  It's 24.
[16:47.940 --> 16:54.340]  Now, in my personal opinion, with my garbage eyes, I can see if you were to hand me a 27
[16:54.340 --> 16:57.860]  inch display and run it at 4K, I can see pixels.
[16:57.860 --> 17:02.420]  And I'm basically, long story short, my eyes are pretty decent when I use hard contact
[17:02.420 --> 17:04.020]  lenses, when I don't have contact lenses.
[17:04.020 --> 17:06.900]  And even if I have Coke bottle glasses, I'm a mess.
[17:06.900 --> 17:08.580]  But with my contacts, I'm pretty good.
[17:08.580 --> 17:12.900]  And if you hand me a 27 inch 4K, I can tell.
[17:12.900 --> 17:19.700]  If you hand me a 24 inch 4K, which is what this 24UD58B is, which is what the LG Ultrafine
[17:19.700 --> 17:24.660]  4K is now, in my personal estimation, I still classify that as Retina.
[17:24.660 --> 17:28.980]  However, when the Ultrafine 4K first came out, it was only 22 inches.
[17:28.980 --> 17:36.020]  And the delta in DPI, or PPI, between the two, between 22 and 24 inches, if it was 22
[17:36.020 --> 17:40.900]  inches at whatever resolution 4K is, I forget off the top of my head, it is absolutely over,
[17:40.900 --> 17:44.740]  I think it's 200 or 218 or something like that points per inch.
[17:44.740 --> 17:49.060]  At 24 inches, it's like 190 or something like that.
[17:49.060 --> 17:53.620]  So strictly speaking, it's just barely below the threshold.
[17:53.620 --> 17:59.140]  And if you look at my original post from 2017, way at the bottom, I cribbed from Mark Edwards
[17:59.140 --> 18:01.540]  with his permission, a chart that he made.
[18:01.540 --> 18:07.060]  And you can see down there, he put, good for Retina, and it's a little green sliver.
[18:07.060 --> 18:09.860]  And then good for non-Retina, it's an even smaller green sliver.
[18:09.860 --> 18:11.940]  And in the middle is what he calls the bad zone.
[18:11.940 --> 18:16.980]  And so at 24 inches, I don't see an example of it here actually, but at 24 inches, oh
[18:16.980 --> 18:23.860]  there at the very bottom, the Dell P2415Q, which ran 3840 by 2160, which I believe is
[18:23.860 --> 18:29.220]  normal 4K resolution, at 24 inches is 183.6 points per inch.
[18:29.220 --> 18:31.860]  And so strictly speaking, that's in Mark Edwards' bad zone.
[18:31.860 --> 18:36.340]  But to my personal opinion, it's sufficient, it's good enough.
[18:36.340 --> 18:42.100]  But to be strictly speaking, 200 plus points per inch, you basically need to get a 27 inch
[18:42.100 --> 18:42.820]  5K monitor.
[18:42.820 --> 18:44.580]  That's about the only choice you've got.
[18:44.580 --> 18:50.900]  And as a Mac user, someone who doesn't ever touch PCs anymore, I want a pixel-doubled
[18:51.860 --> 18:56.340]  4 or 5K display because that's what macOS is designed to use.
[18:56.340 --> 18:59.300]  And I know that the PC people, if any of them are listening, are like, well, what are you
[18:59.300 --> 18:59.700]  talking about?
[18:59.700 --> 19:04.820]  I can get a 350 inch ultra-wide screen, 9 bazillion pixel display.
[19:04.820 --> 19:10.580]  But oftentimes those humongous, humongous displays actually aren't very high resolution.
[19:11.140 --> 19:15.140]  And macOS doesn't really, from what I've gathered, handle that terribly well.
[19:15.140 --> 19:18.900]  With macOS, it's basically 1x or 2x and nothing in between.
[19:18.900 --> 19:24.660]  And so if that's your criteria, then there's very little on the market.
[19:24.660 --> 19:30.900]  Like I said, there's the two LGs, the two LG Ultrafines, the other LG, which I have
[19:30.900 --> 19:35.780]  one at home now, and the XDR up until the studio display.
[19:35.780 --> 19:39.060]  Yeah, it's at 24 inches.
[19:39.060 --> 19:39.700]  I'm with you.
[19:40.260 --> 19:46.900]  I think it's sort of like just barely in the door should count as retina.
[19:46.900 --> 19:53.540]  But 4K at 27 inches is truly in the no-person's-land for Mac users.
[19:53.540 --> 19:53.940]  Agreed.
[19:53.940 --> 19:54.660]  Agreed.
[19:54.660 --> 19:55.940]  Where it's 100.
[19:55.940 --> 20:00.340]  I've got a solver worksheet here that I knew we were going to talk about this.
[20:00.340 --> 20:01.380]  It's 100.
[20:01.380 --> 20:06.020]  And then again, I say 171 pixels per inch.
[20:06.020 --> 20:07.700]  It could be 173.
[20:07.700 --> 20:12.900]  It could be 169 or something like that because it's not exactly, like we know exactly
[20:12.900 --> 20:18.420]  how many pixels there are, but we don't know if it's really exactly 24 inches diagonal
[20:18.420 --> 20:23.300]  or like 20, 23.75 or 24.2 or something like that.
[20:23.300 --> 20:34.580]  So like my math for Apple's Pro Display XDR, which is 6K at 32 inches, my math, quick solver
[20:34.580 --> 20:40.980]  back of the envelope math says 216 pixels per inch, and Apple advertises it as 218,
[20:40.980 --> 20:42.660]  which is what they say for everybody.
[20:42.660 --> 20:48.420]  And that probably is not them lying about or exaggerating how many pixels per inch because
[20:48.420 --> 20:51.140]  who really cares if it's 216 or 218?
[20:51.140 --> 20:57.860]  It probably means that it's really like a 31.9 inch diagonal or something like that.
[20:58.900 --> 21:05.380]  But it turns out 218 pixels per inch is exactly the same pixels per inch as a bunch of other
[21:05.380 --> 21:08.180]  Mac retina displays, including the new studio display.
[21:08.900 --> 21:13.140]  It's by, or I forget if the MacBooks come out to there, but it doesn't matter.
[21:14.180 --> 21:18.980]  For the arms, for the distance, the comfortable distance that Apple thinks people sit in front
[21:18.980 --> 21:23.620]  of a desktop display, 218 is the number they're clearly targeting.
[21:23.620 --> 21:28.020]  192, which would be 4K at 24.
[21:28.020 --> 21:29.780]  It's like, eh, it's close.
[21:29.780 --> 21:34.900]  I think what the effect would be that everything would look a little bigger, right?
[21:34.900 --> 21:40.580]  Like with fewer pixels per inch, you'd get retina resolution, but it would seem less
[21:40.580 --> 21:43.060]  dense, which, you know, some people might enjoy.
[21:43.060 --> 21:48.580]  But when you go 4K at 27, which is where you have more options on the market.
[21:48.580 --> 21:49.460]  Oh, absolutely.
[21:49.460 --> 21:57.380]  Because of the PC world, it's only 172-ish pixels per inch, which is really a no-person's
[21:57.380 --> 22:03.620]  land between 2x at 2x retina and the old 1x.
[22:03.620 --> 22:05.060]  You know, it's like, do you run it?
[22:05.060 --> 22:06.500]  I don't even know what macOS does.
[22:06.500 --> 22:12.020]  I guess it runs it as retina and everything looks tiny and you kind of need to use the
[22:12.020 --> 22:12.980]  scaling options.
[22:12.980 --> 22:17.220]  And the scaling options, again, that's one of those things that I can no longer see.
[22:17.220 --> 22:22.980]  Like when I turn on the scaling options on macOS, you know, whether it's a MacBook or
[22:22.980 --> 22:26.100]  whatever, I don't really see it.
[22:26.820 --> 22:31.220]  If I take off my glasses and get close enough to the screen where I have to worry, you know,
[22:31.220 --> 22:36.420]  that I'm going to like get some grease from my nose, yes, yes, I can totally see, oh,
[22:36.420 --> 22:38.820]  I see this is fakey-fake or whatever.
[22:38.820 --> 22:40.500]  But I don't see it, you know.
[22:40.500 --> 22:45.380]  But I totally remember when my eyes were younger and much better that I would absolutely be
[22:45.380 --> 22:47.140]  able to see, oh, that's scaled.
[22:47.140 --> 22:49.060]  That's not actually pixel for pixel.
[22:49.060 --> 22:51.140]  I can, you know, I could see that.
[22:51.140 --> 22:51.380]  Yeah.
[22:51.380 --> 22:56.980]  And listening to you, you sound utterly bananas, but I agree with you and I've lived it.
[22:56.980 --> 23:02.420]  Like what you're saying is the difference between 150 to 170 points per inch and 190
[23:02.420 --> 23:05.780]  to 220-ish, like that is really that big a deal?
[23:05.780 --> 23:06.340]  Really, Jon?
[23:06.340 --> 23:07.300]  But it is.
[23:07.300 --> 23:12.100]  Like when we were doing this survey of monitors when I was at work, we got in a couple of
[23:12.100 --> 23:16.580]  27-inch 4Ks and I took one look at it and admittedly my eyes were younger at the time,
[23:16.580 --> 23:19.700]  but I took one look at it and was like, uh-uh, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, that's
[23:19.700 --> 23:20.180]  no good.
[23:20.180 --> 23:25.700]  And I know it sounds utterly bananas to hear the two of us say it, but it really does make
[23:25.700 --> 23:27.060]  a dramatic, dramatic difference.
[23:27.060 --> 23:32.180]  And you hit the nail on the head that at 27 inches in 4K, there are a plethora of options.
[23:32.180 --> 23:33.540]  There's a gazillion options.
[23:33.540 --> 23:39.220]  But to my opinion, 27 inches at 4K, it's just not enough resolution.
[23:39.220 --> 23:42.580]  You really, really, really need 5K at that size.
[23:42.580 --> 23:48.020]  And so whenever I posted the original post in 2017 and then most recently in December
[23:48.020 --> 23:51.460]  of last year, I would get a lot of feedback from people saying, what about, what about,
[23:51.460 --> 23:52.100]  what about, what about?
[23:52.100 --> 23:56.980]  And it was all well-intentioned, but I don't think there was a single monitor, available
[23:56.980 --> 24:00.340]  in the United States anyway, that met the criteria.
[24:00.340 --> 24:03.380]  And I don't think the criteria is that ridiculous.
[24:03.380 --> 24:09.860]  It's just that PCs don't seem to have the same needs and they don't seem to do as well
[24:09.860 --> 24:15.700]  in my limited experience with high DPI monitors, or it's very, it's very inconsistent from
[24:15.700 --> 24:16.580]  what I'm told.
[24:16.580 --> 24:20.340]  And so it's just not something that PC users tend to care about.
[24:20.340 --> 24:24.820]  And, you know, the market for a Mac is, or for Macs is much better now than it's ever
[24:24.820 --> 24:27.700]  been, but there's still a heck of a lot more PCs in the world than Macs.
[24:27.700 --> 24:32.500]  And, and certainly if you're wanting something that's this fancy, that's this, you know,
[24:32.500 --> 24:36.500]  high resolution or high DPI, you're probably going to have to spend a little bit of money.
[24:36.500 --> 24:43.300]  That's why I still think the sleeper hit of my research is this preposterously named
[24:43.300 --> 24:46.420]  24UD58-B because it's only 300 bucks.
[24:46.420 --> 24:48.900]  And it's, it's a very, eh, monitor.
[24:48.900 --> 24:54.820]  Like nothing about it is particularly magnificent, but it gets you what I would consider to be,
[24:54.820 --> 25:00.100]  you know, retina screen for only 300 bucks because the next best option, in my personal
[25:00.100 --> 25:03.700]  opinion, as of a couple of weeks ago, is the studio display.
[25:03.700 --> 25:09.620]  And, and, and I skipped deliberately over the slightly cheaper LG Ultrafine 5K because
[25:09.620 --> 25:11.220]  it's just not great.
[25:11.220 --> 25:14.420]  And we can, we can pull on that thread if you're interested, but it's just not great.
[25:14.420 --> 25:15.380]  Well, let's come back to it.
[25:15.380 --> 25:18.580]  Cause I want to come back, but let's as good as time as any to take our first break.
[25:18.580 --> 25:21.460]  Thank our first sponsor, our good friends at Linode.
[25:21.460 --> 25:27.940]  Oh man, visit linode.com slash the talk show and see why Linode has been voted the top
[25:27.940 --> 25:33.460]  infrastructure as a service provider by both G2 and TrustRadius from their award-winning
[25:33.460 --> 25:38.900]  support, which is offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.
[25:38.900 --> 25:40.420]  You want to get support on Christmas.
[25:40.420 --> 25:42.180]  You can get support on Christmas.
[25:42.180 --> 25:44.340]  You want to get support on the 4th of July.
[25:44.340 --> 25:45.140]  You could do it.
[25:45.140 --> 25:45.860]  Somebody's there.
[25:46.740 --> 25:47.860]  Every level of user.
[25:47.860 --> 25:51.620]  You could just have one of their nano accounts, which is like five bucks a month.
[25:51.620 --> 25:57.140]  You get the same top tier support as people who like enterprise customers who are spending
[25:57.140 --> 26:01.380]  a fortune to get their great, huge, huge projects hosted at Linode.
[26:01.380 --> 26:03.700]  They've got the ease of use ease of setup.
[26:03.700 --> 26:04.180]  It is clear.
[26:04.180 --> 26:10.180]  Why developers have been trusting Linode for projects, both big and small since 2003 deploy
[26:10.180 --> 26:14.980]  your entire application stack with Linode one clock app app marketplace, or build it
[26:14.980 --> 26:20.740]  all from scratch, manage everything yourself with supported tools like Terraform.
[26:20.740 --> 26:25.380]  They offer the best price to performance value for all compute instances, including GPU's
[26:25.380 --> 26:29.540]  as well as block storage, Kubernetes, and their upcoming bare metal release.
[26:29.540 --> 26:33.460]  Linode makes cloud computing fast, simple, and affordable, allowing you to focus on your
[26:33.460 --> 26:35.220]  projects, not your infrastructure.
[26:35.220 --> 26:39.220]  Visit linode.com slash the talk show, create a free account.
[26:39.220 --> 26:44.580]  You can use your Google, your GitHub account, or just use your email address, but go to
[26:44.580 --> 26:46.740]  that address linode.com slash the talk show.
[26:46.740 --> 26:48.020]  You'll get a hundred bucks in credit.
[26:50.100 --> 26:53.780]  I host Daring Fireball at Linode, and I just I'm ahead of time.
[26:53.780 --> 26:56.820]  I'm, I'm being, I'm trying to be more responsible as an adult Casey.
[26:56.820 --> 26:58.260]  I know I am.
[26:58.260 --> 26:59.860]  Hey, I got my taxes done.
[26:59.860 --> 27:00.980]  I went to my accountant.
[27:00.980 --> 27:05.860]  I've been going to the same accountant since I was like busted broke out of college, doing
[27:05.860 --> 27:10.420]  just minimal freelance work to support my video game habit in the late nineties.
[27:11.060 --> 27:12.580]  Great accountant here in Philadelphia.
[27:12.580 --> 27:14.420]  I love the guy, but I'm often very late.
[27:15.540 --> 27:17.380]  I got, I got my taxes done already.
[27:18.340 --> 27:22.820]  He complained to me because when we got to the, you know, what do I, what, what does
[27:22.820 --> 27:25.380]  the Daring Fireball company pay for server hosting?
[27:25.380 --> 27:26.260]  He was like, that's it.
[27:26.820 --> 27:30.180]  He literally mentioned that he was like, come on.
[27:30.180 --> 27:31.140]  That's delightful.
[27:31.140 --> 27:35.140]  And it is funny to have you visit your accountant and then all of a sudden you'd start, you
[27:35.140 --> 27:38.260]  know, you start wishing you were paying more for hosting.
[27:38.260 --> 27:39.540]  It's like, we can write that off.
[27:39.540 --> 27:40.100]  Oh man.
[27:41.300 --> 27:45.620]  Well, unfortunately my accountant is not as big a fan of Linode's pricing as I am.
[27:45.620 --> 27:46.340]  Indeed.
[27:46.340 --> 27:52.740]  The display basically, I forget when Apple first said, look, our solution to external
[27:52.740 --> 27:58.820]  displays is this LG thing that we help them build supposedly uses the same, certainly
[27:58.820 --> 28:03.860]  has the same specs, the same 27 inch 5k panel as the IMAX, right?
[28:03.860 --> 28:10.740]  Because that's the thing that has been in this whole desert stretch of Apple not making
[28:11.300 --> 28:16.100]  their own just external displays for Mac users.
[28:16.100 --> 28:21.540]  And then coming back with only the $6,000 effectively, right?
[28:21.540 --> 28:25.380]  Because you do really, you don't get any stand at all, or it's like, you have to pay a
[28:25.380 --> 28:27.540]  thousand for the adjustable stand with the XDR.
[28:28.260 --> 28:33.300]  Like I'm pretty sure it's, it's five grand just for the panel and then a thousand bucks
[28:33.300 --> 28:35.940]  if you want to, to use the official Apple stand.
[28:35.940 --> 28:39.700]  Now you could bring the world's crummiest, you know, visa, visa, whatever it is, mount
[28:39.700 --> 28:44.580]  to it, but it seems a little wrong to put this $5,000 beautiful piece of almost art
[28:44.580 --> 28:47.300]  on like the world's crappiest $20 visa mount.
[28:47.300 --> 28:53.700]  Pro standard visa mount adapter sold separately.
[28:53.700 --> 28:54.500]  I guess so.
[28:54.500 --> 28:55.700]  Well, all right.
[28:56.340 --> 28:58.100]  It is a great display, right?
[28:58.820 --> 29:03.700]  And we'll come back to it, but you know, I'm with you and sometimes listening to ATP.
[29:03.700 --> 29:04.100]  I do.
[29:04.100 --> 29:06.980]  I do feel you're a little, you're a little too stingy.
[29:07.860 --> 29:11.860]  I feel like you're a little understandable.
[29:11.860 --> 29:12.260]  Oh my God.
[29:12.260 --> 29:14.260]  The visa mount is $200.
[29:14.260 --> 29:17.380]  Speaking of stingy, it's $200 for the freaking visa mount.
[29:17.380 --> 29:19.140]  Oh my good gracious.
[29:19.140 --> 29:20.260]  That is bananas.
[29:20.260 --> 29:24.260]  It really wasn't, it wasn't something I was going to consider because it's, it's
[29:24.260 --> 29:28.580]  clearly beyond my needs, but it really, you know, in Apple's, you know, answer, even
[29:28.580 --> 29:31.060]  before the XDR though, was look, we worked with LG.
[29:31.060 --> 29:33.060]  We made this thing that is meant for Mac users.
[29:33.700 --> 29:37.380]  There are on the surface, a lot of similarities to the studio display.
[29:37.380 --> 29:40.020]  It has the same port story, right?
[29:40.020 --> 29:45.540]  There's three USB-C ports, one Thunderbolt, I believe three port.
[29:45.540 --> 29:47.060]  And that's the one you connect.
[29:47.060 --> 29:50.820]  That's the only connection to drive the display.
[29:50.820 --> 29:52.660]  No HDMI, nothing else.
[29:52.660 --> 29:55.220]  It's, you know, do you want to use something like that?
[29:55.220 --> 29:56.580]  You know, welcome to dongle town.
[29:57.380 --> 30:01.940]  And it's supposed to do things like just wake up automatically when your Mac wakes
[30:01.940 --> 30:03.300]  up, et cetera, and so forth.
[30:04.020 --> 30:09.620]  I remember when I first saw it, I think it was the event that was in.
[30:09.620 --> 30:10.260]  Brooklyn.
[30:10.260 --> 30:14.820]  Remember they held, it was like, yeah, I was actually there for that one.
[30:14.820 --> 30:16.420]  That was the only one I've been to.
[30:16.420 --> 30:16.980]  That's right.
[30:16.980 --> 30:17.220]  Yeah.
[30:17.220 --> 30:18.100]  Of course you remember.
[30:18.100 --> 30:22.020]  I remember you, you, the, the three of you guys were seated a couple of rows
[30:22.020 --> 30:25.380]  behind me and panzerino me and panzerino.
[30:25.380 --> 30:26.980]  Not because we're special.
[30:26.980 --> 30:31.140]  Like somehow we just, it wasn't like anybody from Apple is like, Oh, John
[30:31.140 --> 30:32.340]  Gruber and Matthew panzerino.
[30:32.340 --> 30:35.300]  Let's escort you up front somehow though.
[30:35.300 --> 30:36.900]  You know, and, and you, you were there.
[30:36.900 --> 30:41.300]  It is like, it, it, it's like you're waiting and, and it's very nice.
[30:41.300 --> 30:44.820]  And they've got, you know, I don't know, coffee in Danish and stuff for the
[30:44.820 --> 30:48.660]  people who've been invited and you can wait and then the doors open and it's
[30:48.660 --> 30:49.780]  not like a stampede.
[30:50.340 --> 30:55.300]  But it is sort of, you don't know what to expect cause they don't tell you
[30:55.300 --> 30:57.220]  everybody from the media who's been invited.
[30:57.220 --> 31:00.500]  You'll be seated on the left and here's what to do.
[31:00.500 --> 31:03.300]  And you know, there's lots of seats in the middle up front that are all
[31:03.300 --> 31:05.220]  reserved for VIPs.
[31:05.220 --> 31:08.820]  You know, people from Pixar who, you know, Leon Kritz is here for this
[31:08.820 --> 31:09.140]  event.
[31:09.140 --> 31:09.780]  Well, guess what?
[31:09.780 --> 31:11.700]  He's getting a real good seat in the second row.
[31:11.700 --> 31:13.700]  You know, Laureen Powell jobs is here.
[31:13.700 --> 31:14.660]  Oh, well guess what?
[31:15.220 --> 31:16.660]  She gets a good seat.
[31:16.660 --> 31:17.220]  You know what I mean?
[31:18.260 --> 31:18.740]  Yeah.
[31:18.740 --> 31:19.940]  It's like, Oh, where do I go?
[31:19.940 --> 31:20.340]  What do I do?
[31:20.340 --> 31:21.060]  What do I get to see?
[31:21.060 --> 31:25.540]  And then somehow panzerino and I wound up in like the third row for that one.
[31:25.540 --> 31:30.980]  And, and we weren't really on the left, but we weren't surrounded by media
[31:30.980 --> 31:31.780]  people.
[31:31.780 --> 31:36.900]  We were surrounded by Apple retail employees who had been invited.
[31:36.900 --> 31:41.460]  Apparently the deal was that like, I don't know if they flew people in or
[31:41.460 --> 31:45.460]  if it was just like regional Northeast stuff, but it was actually somebody
[31:45.460 --> 31:49.700]  from a suburban Philly store who was right behind us and broke up a
[31:49.700 --> 31:50.180]  chitchat.
[31:50.180 --> 31:54.580]  And it was very nice, but apparently it was like a reward for a very
[31:54.580 --> 31:57.060]  successful Apple retail store employees.
[31:57.620 --> 32:00.580]  And their managers got to say, Hey, you've been doing a great job.
[32:00.580 --> 32:03.380]  We've got a couple passes to this event in Brooklyn.
[32:03.380 --> 32:04.420]  You guys can go.
[32:04.420 --> 32:08.180]  And it was, you know, on the one hand, it was a very nice treat.
[32:08.180 --> 32:10.500]  These people were incredibly enthusiastic.
[32:10.500 --> 32:12.740]  They were so happy to be there.
[32:12.740 --> 32:13.620]  It was amazing.
[32:13.620 --> 32:16.900]  And, but it was also good for, you could see it from Apple's perspective
[32:16.900 --> 32:19.540]  where it made it seem like the audience was crazy.
[32:19.540 --> 32:21.620]  And it was like the Beatles were in town.
[32:21.620 --> 32:23.620]  You know, it was, it worked out for everybody.
[32:23.620 --> 32:27.220]  Apple got an event where it seemed like the audience was very happy because
[32:27.220 --> 32:31.380]  the people in the media, some people, you know, they, they either don't
[32:31.380 --> 32:34.660]  clap because they feel like it's inappropriate as a member of the
[32:34.660 --> 32:37.540]  media to like cheer and clap for a thing that they're there to
[32:37.540 --> 32:40.980]  objectively observe, or they don't even think that far.
[32:40.980 --> 32:44.740]  They're just typing their live blog thing, right?
[32:45.380 --> 32:48.820]  Like, even if they don't have like a personal policy against applauding
[32:48.820 --> 32:51.940]  or something like that, they, you know, so Apple, you know, wants to
[32:51.940 --> 32:52.580]  get the applause.
[32:52.580 --> 32:54.340]  So they put in people who are going to do that.
[32:54.340 --> 32:55.140]  Anyway, you were there.
[32:55.140 --> 32:59.620]  That they remember the hands-on area, they had the LG displays, right?
[33:00.500 --> 33:02.500]  I can't remember if they had the LG displays.
[33:02.500 --> 33:06.420]  I remember the big thing for that day was the iPad Pro, because that
[33:06.420 --> 33:10.340]  was when I believe it was the first of the iPads with Face ID at that
[33:10.340 --> 33:12.420]  point, because this was October, 2018.
[33:12.980 --> 33:16.740]  And the new MacBook Air, if I'm not mistaken, the new retina
[33:16.740 --> 33:18.900]  MacBook Air, I think was also that event.
[33:19.460 --> 33:21.780]  I'm not trying to say that the LG ultra fine wasn't there.
[33:21.780 --> 33:23.940]  I just, I don't recall one way or the other.
[33:23.940 --> 33:27.700]  I remember it was definitely there because there was some Mac
[33:27.700 --> 33:28.740]  news too.
[33:28.740 --> 33:32.500]  And they including, you know, it was, it wasn't even on stage, but
[33:32.500 --> 33:36.500]  like one of the news items of the day was this 15 inch, I guess at
[33:36.500 --> 33:37.540]  the time was the big size.
[33:37.540 --> 33:42.020]  I almost said 16, but the 15 inch MacBook Pro got a new build to
[33:42.020 --> 33:46.660]  order option for a higher end embedded graphics card, you know?
[33:46.660 --> 33:51.540]  And I remember palling around the hands-on area with Austin Mann,
[33:51.540 --> 33:55.780]  the photographer who often does these amazing, amazing, Oh, you
[33:55.780 --> 33:57.220]  know, it, it makes me sick.
[33:57.220 --> 34:01.940]  Cause he's like, you know, he's like on safari, you know, somewhere
[34:01.940 --> 34:05.380]  in Africa shooting pictures of lions with the iPhone 13.
[34:05.380 --> 34:08.260]  And meanwhile, I'm like shooting a picture of a coffee mug on my
[34:08.260 --> 34:08.760]  desk.
[34:09.460 --> 34:09.960]  Right.
[34:10.420 --> 34:11.060]  Exactly.
[34:11.060 --> 34:14.420]  But we were there and we were talking and they had, they had
[34:14.420 --> 34:17.700]  Lightroom on display to talk about like the improvements to
[34:17.700 --> 34:18.020]  something.
[34:18.020 --> 34:21.140]  And it was all being shown on these LG displays and they looked
[34:21.140 --> 34:22.020]  fine, right?
[34:22.020 --> 34:25.700]  I mean, they look, you know, but I just remember looking at the
[34:25.700 --> 34:26.900]  build quality of them.
[34:26.900 --> 34:28.660]  Like the display itself was fine.
[34:28.660 --> 34:33.540]  And it roughly to my eyes, as good as the iMac 5k, I'm sure I
[34:33.540 --> 34:37.220]  I've seen people say it's actually not as good as the iMac 5k in
[34:37.220 --> 34:39.540]  terms of evenness from corner to corner.
[34:39.540 --> 34:43.620]  But the thing that I could instantly observe was this is sort of
[34:43.620 --> 34:45.140]  like a janky build quality.
[34:45.940 --> 34:46.980]  Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
[34:46.980 --> 34:50.740]  So I got one of these secondhand, you know, late last year.
[34:50.740 --> 34:53.940]  And so I got it for steel, which is why perhaps why I'm more
[34:53.940 --> 34:56.420]  enthusiastic and a bit of an apologist for the ultra fine.
[34:56.420 --> 34:59.940]  It is a masterclass in mediocrity.
[34:59.940 --> 35:01.940]  Like everything about it is mediocre.
[35:01.940 --> 35:05.700]  The screen, the panel itself is pretty darn good, but
[35:05.700 --> 35:09.380]  everything around that panel is mediocre on a good day.
[35:09.380 --> 35:11.300]  The build quality is eh.
[35:11.300 --> 35:15.220]  The stand that it comes with was super wobbly.
[35:15.220 --> 35:18.900]  And I don't think it was properly, you know, counterweighted or
[35:18.900 --> 35:19.940]  sprung or what have you.
[35:19.940 --> 35:22.500]  So that it always wanted to either rise or fall, depending on how
[35:22.500 --> 35:26.500]  many things I clamped to the back of it in the USB-C ports.
[35:26.500 --> 35:29.300]  The speakers are preposterously bad.
[35:29.300 --> 35:33.140]  And one of my favorite things about my beloved LG ultra fine is
[35:33.140 --> 35:37.700]  that as you volume up between the third volume notch and the
[35:37.700 --> 35:41.460]  fourth volume notch, the ramp between the third and the fourth,
[35:41.460 --> 35:44.740]  you know, squares or whatever they are, the volume ramp
[35:44.740 --> 35:46.820]  between the two is like quadruple.
[35:46.820 --> 35:49.700]  I am being a little hyperbolic, but it's, you know, it goes,
[35:49.700 --> 35:52.820]  it's kind of a whisper at low and one and two and three and
[35:52.820 --> 35:54.100]  then at four it's like this.
[35:54.100 --> 35:55.300]  It's ridiculous.
[35:55.300 --> 35:58.180]  It's like it's so much louder between three and four.
[35:58.180 --> 36:00.340]  And that was, I believe, one of the things that was supposedly
[36:00.340 --> 36:03.540]  going to come from a firmware update, which I did do.
[36:03.540 --> 36:04.820]  And it didn't make a difference.
[36:04.820 --> 36:06.980]  And speaking of firmware updates, John, did you know that
[36:06.980 --> 36:10.580]  it wasn't until like a month ago that their LG display manager
[36:10.580 --> 36:14.180]  screen manager was able to run on M1 Macs that have been around
[36:14.180 --> 36:16.420]  for what, like a year and a half now, two years now?
[36:16.420 --> 36:18.900]  So it's, everything about it is mediocre.
[36:18.900 --> 36:23.460]  And I don't have the visceral like repulsion that it seems
[36:23.460 --> 36:26.820]  Marco does by having a little tiny understated LG logo on
[36:26.820 --> 36:27.140]  the front.
[36:27.140 --> 36:28.500]  Like would I prefer it to be?
[36:28.500 --> 36:31.540]  Not there, of course, but I don't find it to be particularly
[36:31.540 --> 36:35.700]  offensive, but it's just, it's a pretty good panel, but
[36:35.700 --> 36:39.700]  everything around it is just meh on a good day.
[36:39.700 --> 36:43.140]  And mine, shortly after I got it again, I got it secondhand.
[36:43.140 --> 36:46.500]  Shortly after I got it, the main Thunderbolt connection,
[36:46.500 --> 36:48.500]  so that, you know, USB-C looking, but it's actually a
[36:48.500 --> 36:51.220]  Thunderbolt connection, seemed to dislodge itself from the
[36:51.220 --> 36:52.180]  inside.
[36:52.180 --> 36:58.340]  And so I needed to ship my monitor all the way to California.
[36:58.340 --> 37:00.820]  And then it sat for a while, which I mean, it was the holidays
[37:00.820 --> 37:01.780]  and COVID and so on.
[37:01.780 --> 37:04.420]  So I really shouldn't complain, but it sat for like a month
[37:04.420 --> 37:05.620]  and then eventually came back.
[37:05.620 --> 37:08.180]  But the whole, I could go on a three hour rant about how
[37:08.180 --> 37:10.420]  awful that repair process was.
[37:10.420 --> 37:15.780]  And honestly, for that alone, I'm so excited to be able to
[37:15.780 --> 37:18.340]  have, and mine is coming in a couple of weeks, have an Apple
[37:18.340 --> 37:19.140]  Studio display.
[37:19.700 --> 37:22.500]  And for no other reason than because if something goes wrong,
[37:22.500 --> 37:25.780]  I put it in my car and drive 10 minutes, and then I hand it
[37:25.780 --> 37:28.980]  to someone who will presumably fix it in a fairly timely
[37:28.980 --> 37:29.380]  manner.
[37:29.380 --> 37:33.060]  Like that alone, the repair story, for those of us who are
[37:33.060 --> 37:35.940]  lucky enough to live close to at least one Apple store, the
[37:35.940 --> 37:39.460]  repair story is enough to make me more than interested, let
[37:39.460 --> 37:41.300]  alone everything else that's great about it.
[37:41.300 --> 37:45.060]  I often think, and I think that this whole saga of external
[37:45.060 --> 37:48.180]  displays epitomizes it.
[37:48.180 --> 37:53.300]  I often get the feeling that inside Apple, it's not that
[37:53.300 --> 37:57.140]  they're unaware of the broader computing world in the PC
[37:57.140 --> 38:01.860]  market, that people who work at Apple are so, it's not an
[38:01.860 --> 38:02.660]  insular thing.
[38:02.660 --> 38:05.700]  It's just that the sort of people who go to work at Apple
[38:06.340 --> 38:09.060]  and get to the point where they're successful enough in the
[38:09.060 --> 38:12.740]  company where they can be decision makers who are involved
[38:12.740 --> 38:16.820]  with, like, should we keep making our own displays?
[38:16.820 --> 38:18.260]  Should we trust it to the third?
[38:18.260 --> 38:24.260]  You know, they're so of like-mindedness in their priorities
[38:24.260 --> 38:25.620]  for what matters.
[38:25.620 --> 38:27.940]  Like, what do people really want, you know?
[38:27.940 --> 38:31.300]  And I think it seems so obvious to people who are drawn to
[38:31.300 --> 38:35.380]  Apple and Apple platforms that retina for phones, for
[38:35.380 --> 38:38.180]  tablets, the watch has always been retina, right?
[38:38.180 --> 38:42.980]  The watch is a product that debuted at a resolution that
[38:42.980 --> 38:46.820]  you can't see pixels unless, you know, you have incredibly
[38:46.820 --> 38:48.740]  good eyes or a loop or something like that.
[38:49.540 --> 38:53.460]  This is so obvious, you know, that you would like to, it's
[38:53.460 --> 38:57.380]  like saying, would you like to be healthy or unhealthy?
[38:57.380 --> 39:00.500]  Well, it's obvious, you know, you would like to be healthy,
[39:00.500 --> 39:00.660]  right?
[39:01.620 --> 39:04.260]  Would you like a retina display or not a retina display?
[39:04.260 --> 39:06.580]  Well, obviously you'd like a retina display.
[39:06.580 --> 39:09.540]  And I kind of feel like that mindset blinded them where they
[39:09.540 --> 39:12.100]  thought, you know, we can get out of this market.
[39:12.100 --> 39:15.060]  We'll help LG build one as sort of a reference.
[39:15.060 --> 39:18.340]  And then, you know, the other companies, you know, the Dells
[39:18.340 --> 39:22.660]  and the ACES and whoever else makes displays will pick up
[39:22.660 --> 39:26.740]  the slack and, you know, Mac users will have a variety of
[39:26.740 --> 39:27.300]  third party.
[39:27.300 --> 39:28.260]  It's like printers, right?
[39:28.260 --> 39:30.820]  Apple hasn't made printers for decades now.
[39:30.820 --> 39:32.100]  There's plenty of printers out there.
[39:32.100 --> 39:34.660]  I still sort of wish they made printers, frankly.
[39:34.660 --> 39:35.220]  I agree.
[39:35.220 --> 39:37.060]  Because printers are so bad.
[39:37.060 --> 39:37.940]  I forget what I did.
[39:37.940 --> 39:40.980]  I turned something on on my Eero that you would never, ever
[39:40.980 --> 39:42.740]  think some option in the Eero.
[39:42.740 --> 39:45.220]  I forget what the hell it was, but you wouldn't think it would
[39:45.220 --> 39:45.620]  have anything.
[39:45.620 --> 39:47.700]  All of a sudden, my HP printer wouldn't print, wouldn't
[39:47.700 --> 39:49.380]  couldn't connect to Wi-Fi anymore.
[39:49.380 --> 39:50.180]  And it was like, what?
[39:50.180 --> 39:53.460]  And it wasn't like I turned it like, oh, only use, you know,
[39:53.460 --> 39:56.340]  Wi-Fi 6 or whatever the latest standard is.
[39:56.340 --> 39:59.540]  And my, you know, eight year old laser jet doesn't see it.
[39:59.540 --> 40:01.940]  It was something else, but it was like, God, I hate this
[40:01.940 --> 40:02.500]  fucking thing.
[40:02.500 --> 40:06.820]  But anyway, I think that they thought the monitors thing
[40:06.820 --> 40:09.380]  would be like the printers thing where it's like, ah, you
[40:09.380 --> 40:11.620]  know, there'll be plenty of options for Mac users to choose
[40:11.620 --> 40:11.860]  from.
[40:11.860 --> 40:14.900]  Well, it turned out they're like, as you delineated very
[40:14.900 --> 40:21.540]  well, there were like two and really only one, the LG 27
[40:21.540 --> 40:22.900]  inch 5K ultra fine.
[40:22.900 --> 40:26.820]  Really the one and only Dell had something that was maybe
[40:26.820 --> 40:28.820]  there and then they got out of the business.
[40:28.820 --> 40:32.980]  Like, so not only like the opposite, the opposite of what
[40:32.980 --> 40:35.620]  I think Apple thought would happen, which is that this is
[40:35.620 --> 40:36.660]  where the industry is going.
[40:36.660 --> 40:38.260]  Look at how great these displays are.
[40:38.260 --> 40:40.500]  The whole industry is going to go in this direction.
[40:40.500 --> 40:41.780]  We don't need to make one.
[40:41.780 --> 40:44.340]  And instead, they went the opposite direction.
[40:44.340 --> 40:49.460]  And the PC world concluded, nope, PC users do not want 5K
[40:49.460 --> 40:52.900]  27 inch displays, so we won't make them.
[40:53.620 --> 40:56.580]  Yeah, because why would we bother for the 15 Apple nerds
[40:56.580 --> 40:57.860]  that really care about this stuff?
[40:57.860 --> 41:00.100]  And I mean, it kind of makes sense.
[41:00.100 --> 41:02.900]  Like, if you look at it on the surface of the people that
[41:02.900 --> 41:05.860]  I know, you know, many, many, many of my friends, I'm not
[41:05.860 --> 41:07.060]  talking like our mutual friends.
[41:07.060 --> 41:08.980]  I'm talking about like regular run of the mill friends of
[41:08.980 --> 41:09.940]  mine and family members.
[41:10.740 --> 41:12.580]  All a ton of them are on Macs.
[41:12.580 --> 41:15.700]  In fact, I can think of very few that are on PCs these days,
[41:15.700 --> 41:19.540]  but very, very few of them have an external display at all.
[41:20.100 --> 41:24.420]  And the only person I can think of that cared enough to get
[41:24.420 --> 41:26.660]  the LG ultra fine other than me is my dad.
[41:26.660 --> 41:29.540]  And he probably did that because he went to Apple's website
[41:29.540 --> 41:32.260]  and was looking for whatever Apple recommended.
[41:32.260 --> 41:34.580]  Like, I don't remember he and I talking about it before
[41:34.580 --> 41:35.460]  he bought it.
[41:35.460 --> 41:37.460]  I think he just bought it because he figured that was what
[41:37.460 --> 41:40.660]  Apple advised him to do, which at the time was true.
[41:40.660 --> 41:43.540]  I'm somewhat familiar with the PC market for this because
[41:43.540 --> 41:46.980]  my son Jonas has a gaming PC, which we got him two years
[41:46.980 --> 41:49.940]  ago, and I helped him spec it out.
[41:50.820 --> 41:51.780]  He doesn't regret it.
[41:51.780 --> 41:55.460]  And I've asked him and he doesn't, but he's actually got
[41:55.460 --> 41:56.900]  three displays hooked up to it.
[41:56.900 --> 41:59.060]  Now I forget the model names.
[41:59.060 --> 42:01.300]  It doesn't matter because they're not of interest, but it's
[42:01.300 --> 42:03.140]  like an Asus something or another.
[42:03.140 --> 42:07.620]  That's, I think, like a 24 inch 4K panel, which I encouraged
[42:07.620 --> 42:08.580]  him to get.
[42:08.580 --> 42:11.380]  I thought you don't want something that's not retina.
[42:11.380 --> 42:13.540]  You want something vaguely close to retina.
[42:13.540 --> 42:16.820]  But for playing games, I do think it makes it.
[42:16.820 --> 42:20.340]  He seems to like it because and he's used to his iPhone
[42:20.340 --> 42:23.620]  and iPad, and he has a MacBook that he uses for school.
[42:23.620 --> 42:26.500]  So he appreciates it when he's actually doing something
[42:26.500 --> 42:30.260]  like reading something in a web browser on the PC that
[42:30.260 --> 42:31.700]  it's roughly retina.
[42:32.340 --> 42:34.740]  It looks all right, but it's so super thick.
[42:34.740 --> 42:35.540]  It is crazy.
[42:35.540 --> 42:40.100]  And but it probably was a mistake for a gaming PC that the
[42:40.100 --> 42:41.540]  size wasn't the mistake.
[42:41.540 --> 42:44.580]  It's that the 4K, you don't want to drive your games at that
[42:44.580 --> 42:46.980]  resolution anyway because you want frame rate more than
[42:46.980 --> 42:48.260]  anything for gaming.
[42:48.260 --> 42:52.180]  And it just is it would never make a good Mac monitor.
[42:52.180 --> 42:56.100]  It's just in addition to the fact that it is industrial
[42:56.100 --> 43:01.220]  designed as in the gaming vernacular of like black and like
[43:01.220 --> 43:05.940]  the stand looks like a claw almost, you know, it's from
[43:05.940 --> 43:09.140]  Asus, I believe, or else his other monitor is other displays
[43:09.140 --> 43:09.700]  from Asus.
[43:09.700 --> 43:12.180]  One's from Asus, one's from a company that sounds like
[43:12.180 --> 43:13.060]  Asus, but they're not.
[43:13.060 --> 43:14.820]  They would not be able to do that.
[43:14.820 --> 43:18.420]  And it's I think that's part of the problem is that some of
[43:18.420 --> 43:21.540]  the people who really, really care about their displays in
[43:21.540 --> 43:27.300]  the PC market are gamers, and their interest has nothing at
[43:27.300 --> 43:30.980]  all correlated to the interest of a Mac user who wants to
[43:30.980 --> 43:32.500]  do work, right?
[43:32.500 --> 43:35.540]  It's just an entirely different set of needs.
[43:36.100 --> 43:40.020]  And the PC world is catering to the PC world.
[43:40.020 --> 43:42.180]  And it's not just the PC world.
[43:42.180 --> 43:46.900]  And the PC world is catering to gamers who, you know, for
[43:46.900 --> 43:48.740]  obvious reasons, because they're the ones who are willing
[43:48.740 --> 43:50.580]  to spend a premium on a nice product.
[43:51.220 --> 43:55.540]  And the Mac world, you know, Apple help us, you know, you're
[43:55.540 --> 43:58.740]  our Obi Wan, you know, you're our only help, right?
[43:58.740 --> 44:01.140]  No, you're exactly right that the priorities are just very,
[44:01.140 --> 44:02.180]  very different.
[44:02.180 --> 44:04.980]  And that doesn't make PC users wrong.
[44:04.980 --> 44:06.500]  It's just that they're very different priorities.
[44:06.500 --> 44:08.260]  And the other funny thing, you know, hearing you talk about
[44:08.260 --> 44:12.980]  it, I don't have any particular needs for, like, amazing color
[44:12.980 --> 44:13.860]  reproduction.
[44:13.860 --> 44:14.820]  I don't care.
[44:14.820 --> 44:18.420]  Like, I'm sure I would appreciate a, you know, P3, whatever
[44:18.420 --> 44:22.020]  monitor, but I don't care about perfectly accurate color
[44:22.020 --> 44:22.900]  reproduction.
[44:22.900 --> 44:25.460]  I would prefer in a perfect world to have, like, mini LED
[44:25.460 --> 44:28.500]  or OLED or something like that, but I don't really care that
[44:28.500 --> 44:29.220]  much.
[44:29.220 --> 44:31.940]  And that'll come up in a minute about the studio display.
[44:31.940 --> 44:33.780]  But, you know, my needs aren't that esoteric.
[44:33.780 --> 44:36.340]  I just want a whole bunch of pixels in not a whole ton of
[44:36.340 --> 44:37.300]  space, you know?
[44:37.300 --> 44:38.580]  And I don't think that's too much to ask.
[44:38.580 --> 44:41.300]  But for whatever reason, the market just did not step up,
[44:41.300 --> 44:41.940]  like you said.
[44:41.940 --> 44:45.300]  And you could argue, you know, that sort of kind of happened
[44:45.300 --> 44:47.460]  when Apple dropped the airport line.
[44:47.460 --> 44:48.500]  But then we got Eero.
[44:48.500 --> 44:50.020]  And Eero, I mean, I use it.
[44:50.020 --> 44:52.580]  Granted, they were comped devices, or at least one of them
[44:52.580 --> 44:52.900]  was.
[44:52.900 --> 44:55.140]  But I use them really like Eero.
[44:55.140 --> 45:00.740]  And so I feel like the router world, at least we have a couple
[45:00.740 --> 45:01.700]  of options.
[45:01.700 --> 45:03.940]  Whereas for displays, it was nothing.
[45:03.940 --> 45:08.340]  And I was looking earlier today, I was curious because back
[45:08.340 --> 45:12.020]  many, many Macs ago, I remember lusting after the Thunderbolt
[45:12.020 --> 45:14.980]  display, which was 27 inches, if I'm not mistaken, but not
[45:14.980 --> 45:15.460]  retina.
[45:15.460 --> 45:16.900]  You know, it was 1x.
[45:16.900 --> 45:18.980]  And I was looking it up because I can't remember when did
[45:18.980 --> 45:19.780]  that go away?
[45:19.780 --> 45:22.340]  And according to Wikipedia, the Thunderbolt display was
[45:22.340 --> 45:25.300]  discontinued on the 23rd of June in 2016.
[45:26.020 --> 45:29.380]  And the studio display, my understanding is the first
[45:29.380 --> 45:33.140]  deliveries were the 18th of March 2022.
[45:33.140 --> 45:37.220]  John, 299 weeks in one day between those two dates.
[45:37.220 --> 45:40.180]  Wait, what was the date?
[45:40.180 --> 45:44.340]  June 23rd, June 23rd of 2016 to March 18th of this year.
[45:44.340 --> 45:49.060]  That's 299 weeks in a day or 2094 days, five years, nine
[45:49.060 --> 45:52.900]  months, and two days of no Apple monitors except the XDR.
[45:52.900 --> 45:54.420]  But again, I don't count it.
[45:54.420 --> 45:54.820]  Right.
[45:54.820 --> 45:58.180]  And even if you count the XDR, it was quite a stretch,
[45:58.180 --> 45:58.340]  right?
[45:58.340 --> 45:59.940]  Because that was still a couple of years.
[45:59.940 --> 46:03.700]  Yeah, because that was introduced at WWDC 2019, but
[46:03.700 --> 46:05.620]  didn't ship till later.
[46:05.620 --> 46:06.100]  Right.
[46:06.100 --> 46:06.660]  I think that's right.
[46:06.660 --> 46:06.980]  Yeah.
[46:06.980 --> 46:07.300]  Yeah.
[46:07.300 --> 46:09.540]  So it was still like three, three and a half years.
[46:09.540 --> 46:09.940]  Yeah.
[46:09.940 --> 46:11.300]  So it's good to have them back.
[46:12.340 --> 46:13.540]  I think they needed to.
[46:13.540 --> 46:18.820]  I also feel, I wonder in broad strokes, it's different than
[46:18.820 --> 46:21.300]  selling an entire product, but I sort of feel that the
[46:21.300 --> 46:23.860]  mentality I mentioned of, well, of course the whole world
[46:23.860 --> 46:26.900]  is going to go this way because look at how much better
[46:26.900 --> 46:33.300]  this is, sort of explains Apple going all in on USB-C
[46:33.300 --> 46:38.020]  ports and not USB-A so many years ago.
[46:38.020 --> 46:41.300]  And, you know, famously, which we probably will hopefully
[46:41.300 --> 46:44.020]  get to by the end of the show, your beloved MacBook
[46:44.020 --> 46:47.140]  Adorable, which only had one port and it was USB-C.
[46:47.140 --> 46:53.780]  But it's hard to, you know, when they make a device that
[46:53.780 --> 46:58.980]  is so thin, like iPads where USB-A obviously would not fit.
[46:58.980 --> 47:02.340]  People don't complain, but on any device where theoretically
[47:02.340 --> 47:05.620]  they could squeeze in a USB-A port and it doesn't have
[47:05.620 --> 47:08.820]  one, it's inevitably listed in the cons.
[47:08.820 --> 47:11.780]  Like I don't want to pick on the verge, but I do.
[47:11.780 --> 47:15.460]  I actually do want to pick on the verge, right?
[47:15.460 --> 47:22.660]  Like, you know, the new M1 Macs, MacBook Pros, 14 and 16
[47:22.660 --> 47:24.260]  inch, what do you have, the 14 inch?
[47:24.260 --> 47:24.900]  The 14, yeah.
[47:24.900 --> 47:25.620]  That's what I have too.
[47:25.620 --> 47:26.020]  I love it.
[47:26.020 --> 47:27.940]  It might be the greatest computer I've ever owned.
[47:27.940 --> 47:28.980]  I completely agree.
[47:28.980 --> 47:31.220]  You know, it does not have a USB-A port.
[47:31.220 --> 47:34.420]  Could in theory have had one, I guess.
[47:34.420 --> 47:37.060]  You know, would have fit, you know, size wise.
[47:37.060 --> 47:39.300]  And it's considered a ding or a knock.
[47:39.300 --> 47:44.100]  But I just think that, you know, but more problematically
[47:44.100 --> 47:47.460]  than whether the port is actually on the device,
[47:47.460 --> 47:51.300]  you know, USB-A is the fact that there were so few
[47:51.300 --> 47:55.620]  USB-C peripherals out there and things that you needed,
[47:55.620 --> 47:57.620]  you know, you would need a dongle for.
[47:57.620 --> 48:00.100]  And I really just can't help but think that Apple really
[48:00.100 --> 48:03.220]  thought, oh my God, this USB-C, finally a USB-C that we
[48:03.220 --> 48:05.780]  actually can like, you know, not be grossed out by, you
[48:05.780 --> 48:07.540]  know, it works upside down.
[48:07.540 --> 48:09.140]  You don't have to get it in the right way.
[48:09.140 --> 48:10.420]  It's pretty small.
[48:10.420 --> 48:10.900]  Wow.
[48:10.900 --> 48:12.980]  When the whole, when the rest of the world sees this,
[48:12.980 --> 48:14.900]  they're going to go bananas for it and everything's
[48:14.900 --> 48:16.900]  going to go USB-C. Well, guess what?
[48:16.900 --> 48:17.780]  Didn't really happen.
[48:17.780 --> 48:18.740]  It's been very slow.
[48:18.740 --> 48:23.060]  But I think that Apple guessed correctly 24 years ago
[48:23.060 --> 48:26.020]  when they made the original, famous original iMac,
[48:26.020 --> 48:30.100]  and it only had USB-A ports and got rid of all of the Mac's
[48:30.100 --> 48:33.620]  legacy ports, like my beloved ADB port for the keyboard,
[48:33.620 --> 48:37.460]  just had USB-A. And I think their bet that, hey, the whole
[48:37.460 --> 48:41.700]  PC world is going to go for this USB-C or USB just when
[48:41.700 --> 48:44.180]  it was, when it was just one USB.
[48:44.180 --> 48:46.660]  Well, except remember the weird one that you had to plug
[48:46.660 --> 48:47.460]  into the printer?
[48:47.460 --> 48:48.500]  Plug into the printer.
[48:48.500 --> 48:49.460]  It was like a different.
[48:49.460 --> 48:50.500]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[48:50.500 --> 48:54.340]  You know, USB, USB has always been so fun.
[48:54.340 --> 48:56.660]  But they did, they bet correctly then, like it really
[48:56.660 --> 48:59.540]  did not take long for the PC world to be like, yeah,
[48:59.540 --> 49:04.100]  this USB-C is, USB is way better than serial and whatever
[49:04.100 --> 49:04.500]  else.
[49:04.500 --> 49:05.380]  Parallel.
[49:05.380 --> 49:08.740]  PC two ports, PS2 ports, PS2.
[49:08.740 --> 49:09.860]  Get, let's get rid of all this.
[49:09.860 --> 49:10.500]  Go USB.
[49:10.500 --> 49:12.260]  I think Apple thought the same thing was going to happen
[49:12.260 --> 49:14.260]  with USB-C and it didn't.
[49:14.260 --> 49:16.740]  Yeah, and I don't entirely begrudge them,
[49:16.740 --> 49:20.660]  but I think part of the problem is that either Apple or
[49:20.660 --> 49:24.020]  the USB consortium or what have you, or maybe all the
[49:24.020 --> 49:26.260]  above, they sold us a bill of goods that didn't really
[49:26.260 --> 49:27.380]  end up getting delivered.
[49:27.380 --> 49:30.100]  Because if you think about what we knew about USB-C,
[49:30.100 --> 49:32.180]  whenever it was that this was becoming a thing, I guess
[49:32.180 --> 49:36.020]  like 2015, something like that, whenever the MacBooks
[49:36.020 --> 49:39.700]  started going USB-C, and actually, was it the adorable
[49:39.700 --> 49:41.300]  that was the first one come to think of it?
[49:41.300 --> 49:44.180]  It might've been the adorable, but it doesn't really matter.
[49:44.180 --> 49:46.580]  One way or another, when we started going all in on USB-C,
[49:46.580 --> 49:50.020]  we, there was kind of only one USB-C.
[49:50.020 --> 49:52.420]  If you think about it, like there was the physical connector
[49:52.420 --> 49:56.420]  and it was always USB, or at least it, the way I remember
[49:56.420 --> 49:57.220]  it was that way.
[49:57.220 --> 49:59.860]  But then quickly we started getting Thunderbolt and so
[49:59.860 --> 50:03.300]  in Thunderbolt or Thunderbolt being transmitted over what
[50:03.300 --> 50:05.620]  appeared to be a USB-C cable.
[50:05.620 --> 50:10.100]  And then it quickly became obvious that all USB-C cables,
[50:10.100 --> 50:11.540]  they're all special little snowflakes.
[50:12.260 --> 50:13.780]  None of them are alike.
[50:13.780 --> 50:16.100]  And you can never freaking tell what's what.
[50:16.100 --> 50:18.580]  And like a couple of the cables that I have around the
[50:18.580 --> 50:21.140]  house now, a couple of them actually have a number four
[50:21.140 --> 50:22.580]  on them and like a little Thunderbolt logo.
[50:22.580 --> 50:25.060]  So I know what those are, but the overwhelming majority
[50:25.060 --> 50:28.980]  of the USB-C devices that I have, or that appear to be
[50:28.980 --> 50:32.340]  USB-C in terms of the physical connection, I have no idea
[50:32.340 --> 50:34.020]  if they're USB-C, if they're Thunderbolt, if they're
[50:34.020 --> 50:36.740]  Thunderbolt two, three, four, or what have you.
[50:36.740 --> 50:39.380]  And especially when I was rocking the adorable, this was
[50:39.380 --> 50:42.580]  a real pain in the butt because the adorable only had
[50:42.580 --> 50:44.820]  USB-C, it did not have Thunderbolt.
[50:44.820 --> 50:47.380]  And one of the popular things to do at the time was to get
[50:47.380 --> 50:50.100]  a Thunderbolt dock, which actually I have just done as well
[50:50.100 --> 50:53.060]  for my new computer, but I couldn't use a Thunderbolt dock.
[50:53.060 --> 50:57.460]  I could only use a USB-C dock and there weren't many of them
[50:57.460 --> 50:58.660]  and they were worse.
[50:58.660 --> 51:01.940]  And so I think the part of the problem, part of the slow
[51:01.940 --> 51:06.420]  adoption is that not all USB-C is created alike.
[51:06.420 --> 51:09.140]  Whereas if you think about the original USB days, when it
[51:09.140 --> 51:12.580]  really was one universal serial bus, you didn't really have
[51:12.580 --> 51:13.060]  to think about that.
[51:13.060 --> 51:15.700]  If they physically connected, that's all that mattered.
[51:15.700 --> 51:19.300]  But if I take two different cables that appear, that
[51:19.300 --> 51:23.060]  physically have the same ends, but have very different guts,
[51:23.060 --> 51:25.540]  I may or may not be able to see anything on the screen
[51:25.540 --> 51:27.060]  in front of me, all because of the guts.
[51:27.060 --> 51:29.540]  It has nothing to do with the physical, any properties at
[51:29.540 --> 51:31.700]  all. It's just the guts and it's infuriating.
[51:31.700 --> 51:32.900]  It's absolutely infuriating.
[51:32.900 --> 51:35.780]  I remember a couple of years ago, I was doing a review of
[51:35.780 --> 51:38.820]  some new MacBook and I was like, you know what?
[51:38.820 --> 51:40.500]  I'm not going to set this one up from scratch.
[51:40.500 --> 51:45.700]  Let's try the migration assistant and let me get all of,
[51:45.700 --> 51:48.500]  you know, as much of my regular setup over here on this
[51:48.500 --> 51:50.980]  new thing and I'll actually use it.
[51:50.980 --> 51:52.340]  And I did the migration.
[51:52.340 --> 51:54.740]  I thought over Thunderbolt because I knew both machines
[51:54.740 --> 51:58.500]  had Thunderbolt and it was like, you know, estimated time,
[51:58.500 --> 51:59.060]  20 days.
[52:00.820 --> 52:01.700]  And I was like, what?
[52:03.300 --> 52:05.620]  It was seriously like days or something.
[52:05.620 --> 52:09.060]  It was like, I'm supposed to have this review done in a
[52:09.060 --> 52:12.020]  week. I can't spend, what is going on?
[52:12.020 --> 52:13.540]  And it was a total.
[52:13.540 --> 52:16.660]  I was using a USB-C cable, even though it was connected
[52:16.660 --> 52:18.500]  between two Thunderbolt ports.
[52:18.500 --> 52:21.140]  And I was like, oh, that's it.
[52:21.140 --> 52:21.860]  Stop, stop.
[52:21.860 --> 52:22.500]  Let me cancel.
[52:22.500 --> 52:23.620]  Let me wipe this machine.
[52:23.620 --> 52:24.100]  Start over.
[52:24.100 --> 52:24.660]  Yep.
[52:24.660 --> 52:24.980]  All right.
[52:24.980 --> 52:27.700]  Do I have a necessary Thunderbolt cable?
[52:27.700 --> 52:28.260]  Hmm.
[52:28.260 --> 52:29.380]  I can't seem to find one.
[52:29.380 --> 52:30.500]  I may not have one.
[52:30.500 --> 52:30.820]  Damn.
[52:30.820 --> 52:31.940]  Where did I put it?
[52:31.940 --> 52:32.420]  You know what?
[52:32.420 --> 52:33.140]  I'll go buy one.
[52:33.140 --> 52:34.100]  How much are they?
[52:34.100 --> 52:35.460]  Well, it's so cheap, John.
[52:35.460 --> 52:36.340]  It's so cheap.
[52:36.340 --> 52:37.140]  Don't worry.
[52:37.140 --> 52:37.380]  Right.
[52:37.380 --> 52:38.500]  You can buy them like a chiclet.
[52:38.500 --> 52:40.020]  You know, it's no problem at all.
[52:40.020 --> 52:42.900]  So I had like two of these moments, like within, you know,
[52:42.900 --> 52:45.940]  very short period of like, you know, like if I were a cartoon
[52:45.940 --> 52:50.180]  character, my eyes bugged out on my head, where one, it was
[52:50.180 --> 52:53.940]  how long it was going to take over USB-C between sensible
[52:53.940 --> 52:54.740]  Thunderbolt ports.
[52:54.740 --> 52:58.740]  And then to find out how much like a one foot Thunderbolt
[52:58.740 --> 52:59.140]  cable costs.
[52:59.140 --> 53:00.340]  It's like 40, 50 bucks.
[53:00.340 --> 53:01.060]  Isn't it something like that?
[53:01.060 --> 53:01.940]  Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[53:01.940 --> 53:06.660]  And it's like, like an 18 inch cable, you know, like one of
[53:06.660 --> 53:09.220]  the knocks people have against the Apple studio displays
[53:09.220 --> 53:12.100]  that the included cable, which is very, very nice.
[53:12.100 --> 53:15.300]  It's this new Apple cable style that they've started
[53:15.300 --> 53:17.060]  shipping with the braided material.
[53:18.260 --> 53:21.380]  Very, very nice material premium, but it is like one
[53:21.380 --> 53:24.580]  meter, maybe less, if anything, or it's a meter literally
[53:24.580 --> 53:26.420]  from like metal tip to metal tip.
[53:26.420 --> 53:27.940]  It's not like a meter of cable.
[53:27.940 --> 53:29.060]  It is very small.
[53:29.060 --> 53:31.620]  So you can't, if you're, you know, whatever Mac you're
[53:31.620 --> 53:34.180]  connecting to your studio display, if you're going to use
[53:34.180 --> 53:37.220]  that cable, it can't be too far away from the display.
[53:37.220 --> 53:40.180]  I mean, a meter is not bad, but like the two meter cable
[53:40.180 --> 53:42.980]  is like, it's seriously like 180 bucks or something.
[53:42.980 --> 53:43.700]  I think.
[53:43.700 --> 53:43.940]  Yeah.
[53:43.940 --> 53:44.180]  Yeah.
[53:44.180 --> 53:47.060]  And I'm looking at the Thunderbolt 3 USB-C cable.
[53:47.060 --> 53:49.300]  Eight tenths of a meter is 40 bucks.
[53:49.300 --> 53:50.340]  And I did the same thing.
[53:50.340 --> 53:52.980]  I forget what the occasion was for me doing this, but I had
[53:52.980 --> 53:55.460]  the exact same moment and I was like, well, shit, I guess
[53:55.460 --> 53:56.340]  I'm going to the Apple store.
[53:56.900 --> 53:57.300]  $40?
[53:58.260 --> 53:59.140]  Seriously?
[53:59.140 --> 53:59.780]  $40?
[53:59.780 --> 54:02.340]  And I mean, again, like if you think about it, if you stop
[54:02.340 --> 54:04.420]  and think and you realize all the technology in there, like
[54:04.420 --> 54:05.220]  it does make sense.
[54:05.220 --> 54:06.820]  And I saw a tweet a while ago.
[54:06.820 --> 54:08.260]  I don't think I'll be able to dig it up for the show notes,
[54:08.260 --> 54:11.220]  but somebody had talked about how the two or three meter
[54:11.220 --> 54:14.580]  $150 Thunderbolt cable apparently has like a lot of really
[54:14.580 --> 54:15.860]  trick technology in it.
[54:15.860 --> 54:18.820]  But at a glance, I didn't appreciate it.
[54:18.820 --> 54:19.380]  And I'm a nerd.
[54:19.380 --> 54:21.780]  Like I do sort of kind of this stuff for a living.
[54:21.780 --> 54:24.100]  And I didn't appreciate the fact that I had to pay 40 bucks
[54:24.100 --> 54:26.980]  for less than a meter of cable, much less 150 bucks for,
[54:26.980 --> 54:28.580]  you know, the one or two meters or whatever it is.
[54:29.220 --> 54:30.020]  That's not cheap.
[54:30.020 --> 54:32.500]  That makes sense, though, that it's only eight tenths of a meter
[54:32.500 --> 54:33.780]  because it does it.
[54:33.780 --> 54:36.500]  I didn't measure it, but it feels less than a meter.
[54:36.500 --> 54:36.900]  I don't know.
[54:36.900 --> 54:40.020]  I have like an intuitive sense of three feet equals a meter.
[54:40.020 --> 54:42.980]  I know, you know, I can put my hands out in a pretty good
[54:42.980 --> 54:43.220]  guess.
[54:43.220 --> 54:44.740]  It's like this feels less than that.
[54:44.740 --> 54:48.100]  And it's long enough for me, even though I keep my desk
[54:48.100 --> 54:49.460]  is such that I need to.
[54:49.460 --> 54:53.460]  I like to have the MacBook on the left, so it has to stretch
[54:53.460 --> 54:58.020]  a little bit further because from your viewers perspective,
[54:58.020 --> 55:01.300]  the ports are on the right behind the studio display.
[55:01.300 --> 55:05.620]  So it's a little bit of the cable where I put my MacBook
[55:05.620 --> 55:08.580]  next to it is pretty much stretched completely.
[55:08.580 --> 55:12.500]  But without any stress, it couldn't be any shorter or I'd
[55:12.500 --> 55:15.300]  have to move the MacBook closer than I would like it to be
[55:15.300 --> 55:17.940]  or figure out a way to put the MacBook on the other side.
[55:17.940 --> 55:20.580]  But it is funny, though, as a lay person, because it's true
[55:20.580 --> 55:23.540]  to like at my age where it's like I know computers.
[55:23.540 --> 55:26.500]  I grew up, you know, you know, understanding how computers
[55:26.500 --> 55:26.740]  work.
[55:26.740 --> 55:30.180]  How could this two meter cable be so expensive?
[55:30.180 --> 55:32.420]  All you're doing is shooting electrons across, you know,
[55:33.300 --> 55:33.620]  right?
[55:33.620 --> 55:36.500]  It's all just copper wire with electrons shooting across.
[55:36.500 --> 55:38.820]  And it's like then you start reading about how Thunderbolt
[55:38.820 --> 55:39.380]  cable is working.
[55:39.380 --> 55:42.420]  You're like, oh, it's like a computer in there.
[55:42.420 --> 55:42.820]  Yeah.
[55:42.820 --> 55:46.820]  And it's a Thunderbolt 4 Pro cable, three meters, $160
[55:46.820 --> 55:47.380]  coming soon.
[55:48.340 --> 55:49.060]  Coming soon.
[55:49.060 --> 55:50.100]  That's the best part.
[55:50.100 --> 55:52.420]  You can't even get the damn thing.
[55:52.420 --> 55:53.540]  Holy jamoly.
[55:53.540 --> 55:54.980]  All right, let's take another break here.
[55:54.980 --> 55:56.020]  Let's take another break.
[55:56.020 --> 55:57.220]  Give thanks to our next sponsors.
[55:57.220 --> 55:58.820]  Our good friends at remote.
[56:00.180 --> 56:03.700]  Do you employ or pay workers who are in other countries?
[56:03.700 --> 56:06.740]  Even if you don't yet, you might soon.
[56:06.740 --> 56:10.180]  Now that remote work is the norm and growing ever more.
[56:10.180 --> 56:13.220]  So employees have more freedom than ever to move around.
[56:13.220 --> 56:15.460]  And if you don't want to keep your best people, if you do
[56:15.460 --> 56:17.540]  want to keep your best people, I should say you have to
[56:17.540 --> 56:18.660]  stay flexible.
[56:18.660 --> 56:23.620]  That's why remote makes it easy for companies of all sizes
[56:23.620 --> 56:25.220]  to employ global teams.
[56:25.220 --> 56:29.220]  They take care of international payroll benefits, taxes, local
[56:29.220 --> 56:31.380]  compliance, all of that.
[56:31.380 --> 56:33.780]  So you don't have to focus on paperwork.
[56:33.780 --> 56:36.740]  And instead, you can focus on your actual business.
[56:36.740 --> 56:40.260]  They help you onboard full time employees or contractors
[56:40.260 --> 56:43.380]  in countries all over the world in minutes using their
[56:43.380 --> 56:44.580]  simple, easy to use platform.
[56:44.580 --> 56:49.140]  And even better, remote lets you rest easy by providing the
[56:49.140 --> 56:52.180]  most comprehensive intellectual property protections and data
[56:52.180 --> 56:53.620]  security in the industry.
[56:53.620 --> 56:59.140]  They own full local legal entities in all of the covered
[56:59.140 --> 57:01.940]  countries, guaranteeing that you never have to deal with
[57:01.940 --> 57:03.300]  the third party ever.
[57:03.300 --> 57:06.420]  You just deal with remote and remote deals with all the
[57:06.420 --> 57:08.980]  hassles with your employees who live in those countries to
[57:08.980 --> 57:09.620]  save you money.
[57:09.620 --> 57:12.100]  They never charge any fees or salary percentages.
[57:12.100 --> 57:15.220]  You get access to everything remote access offers from
[57:15.220 --> 57:18.180]  payroll to compliance to benefits management for one low
[57:18.180 --> 57:21.620]  flat rate, no hidden fees, no surprises ever.
[57:21.620 --> 57:24.660]  Just the best global employment solution in the business.
[57:24.660 --> 57:27.860]  And best of all, listeners of this show get an even bigger
[57:27.860 --> 57:28.260]  discount.
[57:28.260 --> 57:32.740]  You can get 50% off remote full suite of global employment
[57:32.740 --> 57:35.860]  solutions for your first employee for three months.
[57:37.700 --> 57:41.140]  First employee, three months, you get 50% off.
[57:41.140 --> 57:45.700]  Just visit remote.com the talk show and remember that promo
[57:45.700 --> 57:48.180]  code the talk show and you get the discount.
[57:48.180 --> 57:52.180]  See why top global companies like GitLab trust remote to
[57:52.180 --> 57:53.940]  manage and pay their international teams.
[57:53.940 --> 57:57.860]  Whether you want to hire one person or 100 remote makes it
[57:57.860 --> 58:01.700]  easy. Visit remote.com the talk show and remember that promo
[58:01.700 --> 58:23.780]  code the talk show.
[58:31.700 --> 58:33.300]  Try that one out if you want.
[58:33.300 --> 58:34.420]  That is accurate.
[58:34.420 --> 58:37.220]  I would never say that on your show, but that is hypothetically
[58:37.220 --> 58:37.460]  anything.
[58:37.460 --> 58:41.700]  Oh, I'm generous with the promo codes.
[58:42.500 --> 58:44.820]  Are you generous with your review units though?
[58:44.820 --> 58:47.700]  Because I'm not getting an Apple Studio display for another
[58:47.700 --> 58:50.180]  couple of weeks and I will be happy to take yours off your
[58:50.180 --> 58:51.620]  hands until then.
[58:51.620 --> 58:52.180]  You know what?
[58:52.180 --> 58:58.020]  It is funny because they ship it and they're never banging on
[58:58.020 --> 59:01.380]  the door to get review unit sent back.
[59:01.380 --> 59:05.940]  But they ship it with a preprinted FedEx label to send it
[59:05.940 --> 59:08.820]  back. And it's like this review unit is through.
[59:08.820 --> 59:11.940]  I think for these, they said September, which is nice.
[59:11.940 --> 59:13.300]  It's longer than usual.
[59:13.860 --> 59:14.500]  I feel bad.
[59:14.500 --> 59:15.700]  I'm going to order one.
[59:15.700 --> 59:18.500]  Here's my person before we get into the details of it.
[59:18.500 --> 59:19.540]  My personal situation.
[59:19.540 --> 59:21.860]  I'm 100% going to buy one because this is the display I've
[59:21.860 --> 59:22.580]  been waiting for.
[59:22.580 --> 59:28.420]  And overall, camera aside, I'm extremely happy with it.
[59:28.420 --> 59:29.780]  It's like, yeah, this is what I want.
[59:29.780 --> 59:30.420]  I love it.
[59:30.420 --> 59:33.700]  But what I want to do is I want to see the nanotexture glass
[59:33.700 --> 59:34.260]  in person.
[59:34.260 --> 59:36.100]  It's a $300 upgrade.
[59:36.100 --> 59:40.100]  I do not want to just buy it and wait and get even though
[59:40.100 --> 59:40.900]  I probably should.
[59:40.900 --> 59:44.420]  But I hate I just hate sending anything back to anyone.
[59:44.420 --> 59:44.900]  I hate it.
[59:44.900 --> 59:45.460]  I don't know why.
[59:45.460 --> 59:45.940]  Same.
[59:45.940 --> 59:46.340]  Same.
[59:46.340 --> 59:46.820]  I don't know.
[59:46.820 --> 59:51.700]  I'll just if I bought the nanotexture glass, I would just
[59:51.700 --> 59:54.740]  like, I don't know, put it under my desk and buy a glossy
[59:54.740 --> 59:59.940]  one. Even though like I don't want to spend $5,000 on a pro
[59:59.940 --> 01:00:05.460]  display XDR, but I'll blow $5,000 by buying, you know, I'll
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:09.380]  buy the $2,000 nanotexture one and then just say, give me
[01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:09.780]  the other one.
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:12.020]  But anyway, I want anything to avoid returning one.
[01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:12.820]  That's all that matters.
[01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:13.940]  I do want to see it in person.
[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:18.260]  My review unit is the standard glossy one, which it does have
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:21.060]  a very, very nice anti-reflective coating.
[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:27.540]  But my as you see from my example photos in my review or
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:30.900]  any other time I occasionally shoot those videos in my office.
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:33.220]  I do have lots of windows, which I love.
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:37.220]  And it's one of the reasons we bought this house.
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:38.180]  I love the windows.
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:43.620]  I love the light, but windows and glare are, you know, go
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:44.580]  hand in hand.
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:48.500]  It's not bad, but, you know, there's a window over my shoulder
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:51.540]  that at certain times of the year at certain times of the
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:53.140]  day, it's right on the display.
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:57.780]  So I feel like I'm at least a maybe on the nanotexture glass,
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:02.980]  but it seems like the nanotexture with the XDR has very mixed
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:06.820]  reviews from people who thought, oh, I would like to have
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:10.500]  matte, but then they get the nanotexture and you're like,
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.060]  I don't know.
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:12.100]  I don't like this.
[01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:12.340]  Yeah.
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:15.380]  I have heard a lot of the same and I can't cite any particular
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:18.260]  person that has said this to me, but I feel like I've heard
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:19.300]  a lot of the same rumblings.
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:22.020]  The nanotexture is kind of a mixed bag.
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:23.460]  Our friend Luke had one.
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:25.220]  Remember, he sent his back.
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:26.660]  He was like, F this.
[01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:27.940]  And he was very surprised.
[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:31.380]  Well, then the problem with it is, and again, I am not at the
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:35.060]  least bit sour that Apple didn't send me both as a review
[01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:37.460]  unit. That's the last thing I need.
[01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:37.780]  All right.
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:39.060]  I'm one person, right?
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:43.220]  So like the Verge got, I'm friends with Nilay, the Verge got
[01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:48.340]  two M1 Mac Studios with the Max and the Ultra, and they got
[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:50.500]  both of the displays nanotexture or not.
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.300]  But the Verge has a big staff.
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:57.700]  That's the last thing I needed was more stuff to review.
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:01.380]  And I would actually, as a reviewer talking to my audience,
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:03.540]  I'd rather have the one that most people are going to buy,
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:04.420]  which is the default.
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:09.380]  So I'm glad it's no sour grapes or petulance about it.
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:12.180]  The downside, though, is that the nano, this is the big
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:16.020]  downside, is that the nanotexture models are not on display
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:17.700]  in most Apple stores.
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:22.820]  I asked Apple during my review period, will they be on
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:23.780]  display in stores?
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:28.660]  And the initial answer was they will be on display in select
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:29.300]  Apple stores.
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:34.420]  And I wrote back and I said, okay, that's good to know.
[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:37.540]  But how do I know if my Apple store has been selected?
[01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:40.340]  And are you in New York or San Francisco or LA?
[01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:41.380]  That's what you need to know.
[01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:41.700]  Yeah.
[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:47.700]  So the answer I got was, and there's no way online to tell,
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:48.420]  unfortunately.
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:50.500]  And I don't blame them.
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.140]  There's only so many things they can put on the website of
[01:02:53.140 --> 01:03:00.820]  apple.com and being able to query specifically which products
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:06.500]  are on display at this store is a weird thing to want from
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:06.740]  Apple.
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:07.860]  But I kind of wish they did.
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:10.980]  What you can do, of course, is call your local Apple store
[01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:14.260]  and a friendly Apple store representative will be able to
[01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:14.980]  answer you.
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:18.260]  But the answer is probably no, that they don't have nanotexture.
[01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:22.020]  For me, living here in Philadelphia, we have a store right
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:26.020]  here in Center City, Philadelphia, which is literally blocks
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:27.060]  away from me.
[01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:32.740]  It would be preposterous even in pouring down rain.
[01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:35.300]  Maybe in pouring down rain, I would take an Uber or something,
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:37.460]  but it is easy walking distance.
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:38.820]  It would be walking distance.
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:41.380]  Maybe not to buy.
[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:44.020]  Would I walk home with a studio display?
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:45.220]  See, that's the question.
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:48.660]  You walk there and then you take your Uber back.
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:52.340]  Yeah, well, if I were going to buy something like that, I'd
[01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:53.220]  get it shipped to me.
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:54.020]  Oh, you know what you can do?
[01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:55.460]  You can always get the courier service.
[01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:55.860]  That's right.
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:56.420]  That's true.
[01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:59.140]  Yeah, they have courier service, which I've used to buy
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:01.220]  stupid things like when I've needed a cable.
[01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:03.700]  And because I live here in Center City, Philadelphia, I can
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:06.340]  usually get them within like two hours, which is amazing.
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:07.620]  They do not.
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:10.820]  They are not going to have the nanotexture one on display.
[01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:15.460]  We have a King of Prussia Mall, which is somewhat famous
[01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:16.020]  as a mall.
[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:19.060]  It is one of the largest, has been for decades, one of the
[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:21.220]  largest shopping malls in the country.
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:23.060]  King of Prussia is a suburb of Philly.
[01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:27.700]  It's about 15 miles as the crow flies, which isn't bad and
[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:31.220]  used to be before Apple opened a Center City, Philadelphia
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:31.620]  store.
[01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:35.140]  It was the closest Apple store, one of the closest for people
[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:36.420]  who live in the city here.
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:38.820]  The other one would be Cherry Hill, New Jersey, which is
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:39.780]  right across the bridge.
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:41.540]  Very easy drive.
[01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:43.940]  But like the King of Prussia Mall, Apple store is the one.
[01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:48.180]  That's the one I waited at in 2007 to get my first iPhone.
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:52.100]  When you had remember that when you actually there was no
[01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:52.980]  way to preorder.
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:55.940]  You just went in the morning and sat there all day.
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:57.940]  And then they went on sale at like 6 p.m.
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:04:58.660]  or something like that.
[01:04:58.660 --> 01:04:59.700]  That's the King of Prussia.
[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:03.700]  The problem with the King of Prussia as a Philadelphia is
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:10.180]  it is 15 miles, but it is the longest 15 miles imaginable.
[01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:13.540]  It is you have to take what we our beloved Schuylkill
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:17.940]  Expressway, which if there's no traffic, like if I guarantee
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:20.260]  you, if I tried to make the drive from my house to the
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:24.180]  King of Prussia Mall at two in the morning, I could do it
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:25.700]  in 15 minutes.
[01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:28.820]  Easy, probably less the way the speeds I drive at.
[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:32.180]  But, you know, at normal times of the day, it could be an
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:32.580]  hour.
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:34.260]  It is very bad traffic.
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:35.540]  But anyway, I will go there.
[01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:38.420]  I will check it out before I decide what to order, but it's
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:43.220]  sort of like I kind of have to gear myself up for it.
[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:45.300]  It's an all day affair, unfortunately.
[01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:46.100]  Did you call them yet?
[01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:49.620]  Do you know that they will have a display model?
[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:54.100]  I cheated and Apple PR confirmed for me that I haven't
[01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:55.540]  been there in a long time.
[01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:59.300]  I mean, guess we're at the point now coming out of covid
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:04.180]  where I keep forgetting like we're doing more normal stuff
[01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:06.340]  and I'm like, why is it that I haven't been to the King of
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:08.340]  Prussia Mall in recent memory?
[01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:10.900]  And I'm like, oh, yeah, that was like two years.
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.220]  Yeah, there was like two years where I hardly left the
[01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:13.540]  house.
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:14.020]  That's it.
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:14.900]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:19.060]  Yeah, but the King of Prussia Mall I recently underwent a
[01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:19.860]  big renovation.
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:22.020]  They used to be two malls that were right now.
[01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:24.580]  They called it one mall, but there were like two actual
[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:27.780]  structures and like a parking lot between them and a walkway
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:33.620]  and it was very sufficiently close that it wasn't ridiculous
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:36.100]  to call it one big mall, even though you had to go outside
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:40.260]  to get between the two, but they renovated and added a
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:43.620]  stretch in between the two to keep it all indoors.
[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:47.860]  And that new stretch is where they put all of the super
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:52.580]  premium brands like the Tiffany, Louis Vuitton, Gucci,
[01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:55.940]  you name ultra luxury fashion brand.
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:58.980]  They're in this new stretch that's between what used to be
[01:06:58.980 --> 01:06:59.700]  the two malls.
[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:01.860]  And you'd think, oh, that's probably where the Apple store
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:02.500]  is now, too.
[01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:06.500]  But instead, I think what they did, if I'm recalling
[01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:08.820]  correctly, because I've only been there once since the
[01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:12.500]  renovation, is it seems like what they did is they sort of
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:18.260]  like Apple took a spot in one of the two malls close to that
[01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:21.860]  thruway, but they moved from like their original location
[01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:24.340]  where they'd been since like the early 2000s when they first
[01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:29.060]  opened to this new one as sort of a I'm betting it was like
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:32.660]  a fascinating negotiation of real estate of mall real estate
[01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:34.980]  where they're like, Apple is like, we'd like to be in this
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:36.660]  new section, you know, like next to Tiffany.
[01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:38.740]  And they're like, yeah, but we'd kind of like to have some
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:41.780]  really good brands elsewhere, like anchoring.
[01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:45.140]  What about this huge, huge spot here?
[01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:47.220]  And they're like, oh, yeah, well, we'll do that, but we'll
[01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:49.380]  pay you nothing or something, right?
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:50.580]  You know how Apple negotiate?
[01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:51.060]  Oh, yeah.
[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:56.100]  So but they have it is it is it is like a it has long been one
[01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:58.740]  of the quote unquote, select Apple stores.
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:01.220]  So I will go out there and see it before I make my own
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:05.380]  purchasing decision, even though I'm very worried, because
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:10.340]  the lighting inside Apple stores is not like the lighting
[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:12.180]  in my office because it's not daylight.
[01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:15.460]  It is this super diffuse, beautiful lighting.
[01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:18.180]  And in fact, I thought that when you sent me the screenshot
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:21.300]  yesterday, you went to an Apple store to see the the studio
[01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:22.180]  display, right?
[01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:22.580]  That's right.
[01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:27.220]  And you look pretty good from the camera, because the lighting
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:29.700]  is so diffuse and very nice in an Apple store.
[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:31.940]  So I'm still I'm a little concerned that I'll go to the
[01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:34.660]  Apple store, look at the nano texture and think, yes, this
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:38.020]  is what I want, and then buy it and then put it in my office.
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:39.220]  And it'll look totally different.
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:41.220]  And I'll be like, Oh, here's what we'll do.
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:43.540]  I will go return it on your behalf.
[01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:46.100]  If you'll take me to hop sing, because that's something I
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:47.620]  don't know if we're gonna have the time to talk about today.
[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:50.900]  But I am very mad at myself that I never made the track up
[01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:53.780]  to Philly for like coca love or anything and go to hop sing.
[01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:58.500]  So I will trade you one very socially awkward return in favor
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:08:59.860]  of getting me in the door.
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:02.020]  If that works for you, I will take you there.
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:05.540]  The things I've heard about nano texture from the XDR people
[01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:08.980]  are and actually, I think because Neelay told me that some
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:11.540]  of the Verge staffers really like the nano texture, like
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:14.180]  their photographers, so they really like it.
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:17.780]  But the problem is that it's a real bitch to clean.
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:18.980]  Yeah, I've heard the same.
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:22.100]  If somebody touches it, like you get like one thumb print
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:26.580]  on the damn thing, and it's like a grease spot that you
[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:27.460]  cannot get off.
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:30.420]  And it does, you know, the nice thing is that it does ship
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:32.420]  with Apple's $19 polishing cloth.
[01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:35.380]  So you get that free, really.
[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:38.020]  It's like getting a free $19 polishing cloth.
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:41.060]  Yeah, I bought that polishing cloth, the standalone one,
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:42.260]  just because I had to.
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:43.860]  It ships.
[01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:44.980]  And it's so funny.
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:47.380]  It's the packaging.
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:52.020]  You know how the Apple packaging, the instructions have
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:53.060]  very few words.
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:56.820]  They're sort of like Lego instructions, you know, Lego and
[01:09:56.820 --> 01:10:00.100]  IKEA, where they're sort of pictograms that just show you
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:01.700]  what to do instead of explaining it.
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:04.740]  So they can just ship the same thing worldwide.
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:09.620]  They tell you not to use the side with the Apple logo on it.
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:10.900]  Oh, I did not know that.
[01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:12.580]  Yeah, but I don't know why.
[01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:15.940]  Jonas and I looked at it and we're like, honest to God, you
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:16.500]  can touch it.
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:17.060]  You can look at it.
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:17.860]  You can feel it.
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:20.340]  It doesn't look like there's any difference, but there's like
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:21.700]  a little circle with a line through it.
[01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:23.300]  Like, don't use the side with the Apple logo.
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:25.860]  Use the other side and go in a circular motion.
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:28.500]  And it's funny because I don't have colleagues.
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:33.620]  You know, if anybody can get this display to never be touched
[01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:36.340]  by human fingers, it's probably me.
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:39.620]  I mean, you'd have to be like a genuine hermit, you know,
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:42.980]  to make it, but it could happen.
[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:43.460]  You're right.
[01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:44.580]  You never know.
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:44.980]  Right.
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:49.540]  And it's like, I'm an anti touch the screen person, period.
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:53.060]  But, you know, and I can be a little, Hey, what are you doing?
[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:56.260]  You know, but if I get the nano texture, it's going to have
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:58.980]  to be like, I'm going to have to put like red tape on the
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:10:59.300]  ground.
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:02.740]  Or do you like some sort of like infrared beam?
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:05.540]  Like what was the movie with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Sean
[01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:07.540]  Connery in Trap Mint?
[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:10.020]  Is that it where she goes like dancing through the through
[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:11.220]  the laser beam maze?
[01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:11.940]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:14.260]  Yeah, you're going to put like a laser beam maze in front
[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:16.900]  of the screen or some sort of proximity alarm or something.
[01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:17.540]  Yeah.
[01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:18.260]  You know, I got it.
[01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:21.540]  So I'm looking at the the buy page for the studio display,
[01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:25.700]  and it is clearly not popular at all because I tell you what,
[01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:29.300]  the only thing you can get in less than quote eight to
[01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:32.340]  ten weeks is the tilt adjustable stand.
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:34.660]  If you go tilt and height adjustable eight to ten weeks,
[01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:36.020]  they're not even telling you like a month.
[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:37.380]  It's just eight to ten weeks.
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:39.140]  Visa mount adapter eight to ten weeks.
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:41.460]  I mean, obviously everyone, it's not just you and me that
[01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:43.540]  are waiting for a cold glass in hell.
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:46.340]  Like everyone is interested in this, it seems, because I
[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:48.020]  know it's, you know, supply chain and blah, blah, blah.
[01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:51.620]  But still, I've got to imagine if anyone would get their
[01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:54.100]  supply chain squared away for a new product, it would be
[01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:54.500]  Apple.
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:57.060]  And from the looks of it, these things are sold out for
[01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:57.780]  forever.
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:58.260]  Yeah.
[01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:02.500]  And a combination maybe of pent up demand and supply chain.
[01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:03.460]  Yeah, fair enough.
[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:04.100]  Chain problems?
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:04.740]  I don't know.
[01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:10.980]  Anyway, talking about the display itself, I'm very happy
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:14.500]  with my review from a week ago, but I'll tell you, I was
[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:18.260]  nervous because I've spent so much time bitching about the
[01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:25.940]  camera and it's not nervousness like, oh, you know, you're
[01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:28.100]  not supposed to give bad reviews to Apple products.
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:30.020]  It's just like, am I nuts?
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:30.260]  Right?
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:34.100]  It's not any sort of like, you know, feeling that I'm not
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:35.140]  supposed to say bad day.
[01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:35.940]  I love it.
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:38.340]  You know, in theory, it's like, you know, anybody who wants
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:41.140]  to accuse me of being a homer for Apple products, it's like
[01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:43.460]  the best thing to happen is, you know, get one that you
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:45.300]  don't like and then tell people about why.
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:50.020]  But the camera thing in particular was making me feel
[01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:51.300]  like gaslit.
[01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:52.260]  Like, am I nuts?
[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:57.460]  Am I, you know, and, you know, I did commiserate with
[01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:58.980]  Nilay and Joanna.
[01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:01.380]  I forget who reached out to whom first.
[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:02.340]  I forget if it was me.
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:05.940]  I think I reached out to Nilay and say, hey, do you have
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:06.420]  this thing?
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:10.980]  And, you know, and then we did like a three person FaceTime.
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:12.180]  It just the three of us.
[01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:14.420]  And we're all we were all like on the same page.
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:18.100]  Like I'm sort of thinking this camera is really makes me
[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:20.820]  look looks it's bad quality period.
[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:21.460]  It's fuzzy.
[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:25.780]  It's noisy and really doesn't bad number on skin tones
[01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:26.740]  across the board.
[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:30.180]  And we're all looking at each other like, yeah, we look
[01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:30.580]  terrible.
[01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:32.180]  And then I was like, well, wait a second.
[01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:36.740]  You know, Input magazine, Ray Wong at Input got Apple to
[01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:39.700]  confirm first that it's the same front facing camera as the
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:43.220]  new iPad Air, which in turn is the same front facing camera
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:45.380]  that's been in the iPad Pro for a year.
[01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:49.860]  Basically, one way to think about it is that so far every
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:53.380]  Apple device that supports center stage uses the same camera
[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:56.980]  hardware and ultra wide, I think 12 megapixel, but who cares
[01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:01.540]  what the ultra wide field of view front facing camera.
[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:03.620]  And I was like, I've got the iPad here right here.
[01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:05.300]  I'm doing a review of that, too.
[01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:05.540]  Here.
[01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:06.340]  I'm getting off.
[01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:08.420]  I'm going to hop back on with the iPad Air.
[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:10.660]  And I did on the same call.
[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:11.780]  And I was like, do I look better?
[01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.700]  And I was like, I think I look better in my preview.
[01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:15.380]  And they're like, oh, you look and they're like, you look
[01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:16.260]  way better.
[01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:16.820]  You look way.
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:17.860]  And we're like this.
[01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:19.060]  Yeah, this is crazy.
[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:20.900]  And I'm like, all right, I'm going to get off and go back
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:21.780]  to the studio display.
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:22.500]  Do I look worse?
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:23.460]  Yes, you look.
[01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:25.140]  Now you look, you look sick.
[01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:28.260]  Yeah.
[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:30.740]  So I went to the Apple store yesterday, like you had said,
[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:32.900]  and I had read all the reviews.
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:33.460]  I'd read yours.
[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:36.580]  I'd seen The Verge's review, and I'd seen Joanna's really
[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:39.620]  good video where she did like kind of a play on March Madness,
[01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:41.220]  which I mean, her video work is so good.
[01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:44.500]  It's infuriating how good she is at basically everything.
[01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:45.700]  You know she won an Emmy.
[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:47.220]  I did not know that.
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:47.780]  Did she really?
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:50.740]  Yeah, she won an Emmy for the thing about the thing last year
[01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:56.260]  about how to plan for your eventual death.
[01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:57.620]  Yeah, she'll never let me forget it.
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:00.740]  Emmy award-winning Joanna Stern.
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:01.700]  Emmy award-winning, that's right.
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:03.860]  But no, she is so impossibly good at what she does.
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:06.260]  And anyways, so I went to the Apple store,
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:08.340]  and I'm playing around the display
[01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:11.140]  and leaving the camera side just very briefly.
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:12.420]  Like the panel looks great.
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:13.540]  And of course, you know, I'm trying
[01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:16.660]  to think of ways in which I can, you know,
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:20.260]  try to exercise this display that's not connected
[01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:21.860]  to a machine that I can, in retrospect,
[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:23.620]  I should have just brought my computer and connected it.
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:24.740]  It just occurred to me just now.
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:28.740]  But nevertheless, you know, it's connected to a M1 Mac's studio.
[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:30.500]  And I'm trying to think of things that I can do
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:34.020]  to kind of exercise the display and show what it's made of.
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:36.980]  And I looked at the photos, the canned photos
[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:40.180]  and the photos app on Apple's display Mac.
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:41.620]  And of course, they're all gorgeous.
[01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:44.020]  And this display looks phenomenal.
[01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:47.540]  I ended up logging into my own Plex server, you know,
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:51.380]  from the web and playing a little bit of Hamilton in 4K.
[01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:55.460]  And it looked great, you know, it looked phenomenal.
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:58.900]  And then I opened up Photo Booth to take a picture
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:00.740]  of myself just to see, well, first of all,
[01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:03.300]  to verify that center stage does not work in Photo Booth,
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:04.820]  and it doesn't, which I was pretty sure
[01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:05.620]  was going to be the case.
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:06.980]  But nevertheless, I wanted to see.
[01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:08.180]  And then I took a picture of myself
[01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:11.060]  and I uploaded it to my, you know, my Synology at home
[01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:12.020]  so I could look at it later.
[01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:15.540]  And when I was looking at it in the Apple store,
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:16.740]  it looked fine.
[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:19.300]  Like I wouldn't say it was great, but it looked fine.
[01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:21.860]  But then I was walking out of the mall
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:22.980]  and I was looking at it on my phone
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:24.500]  and I started zooming in and I'm like,
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:27.380]  oh, oh, this is not that fine at all.
[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:29.460]  This is actually not great.
[01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:32.100]  It's really not a fantastic picture.
[01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:35.060]  And in particular, a lot of the fine details
[01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:37.620]  like the wrinkles in my forehead, for example,
[01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.700]  I feel like they're very, very fuzzy.
[01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:42.180]  Like everything just seems fuzzier than I would expect.
[01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:43.300]  It very much looks like, you know,
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:46.980]  the 720p front-facing cameras that were on Apple laptops
[01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:48.580]  for 18 fricking years.
[01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:50.580]  And it looks kind of like that.
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:55.300]  And based on my gut, like I'm inclined to believe
[01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:56.980]  that when Apple says, oh, it's software,
[01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:59.860]  it's software, it's software, that it probably is.
[01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:04.180]  Like, I assume that to be true, but golly, for right now,
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:05.380]  it does not look great.
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:06.660]  It really doesn't.
[01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:07.220]  It is.
[01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:10.260]  It was such a weird saga, publishing the review
[01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:12.820]  and then hearing from, you know,
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:15.700]  and all of my interaction up to the point of publishing
[01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:16.980]  was through Apple PR.
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:20.020]  And Apple PR, when you're dealing with them as a reviewer,
[01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:23.700]  is not a faceless organization.
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:26.500]  I know people there and the people who I was communicating
[01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:29.300]  with are people who I've known for years there.
[01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:31.380]  It's not just like, you know, as a reviewer,
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:34.820]  you're not just sending email to applepr at apple.com
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:37.380]  and getting a response from somebody you don't know.
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:42.660]  You know, there was, it was unusual because usually
[01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:45.380]  if you're, as a reviewer, you encounter a problem
[01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:46.660]  and you let them know.
[01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:48.740]  And, and, you know, and I don't know,
[01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:51.060]  I can't speak for everybody who reviews products,
[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:54.340]  but I, and Nilay and Joanna and I were both,
[01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:55.620]  the three of us were talking about it,
[01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:57.860]  that all three of us are of a similar mindset
[01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:01.220]  where we don't want to surprise anybody.
[01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:02.740]  You know, we don't want to surprise Apple.
[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:05.700]  We, we tell them, you know, and, and when they ask,
[01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:07.540]  you know, like halfway through the week of reviewing,
[01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:08.740]  what are your thoughts?
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:12.020]  I'm always very honest, you know, positive or negative,
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:14.900]  you know, here's, here's what I think so far, you know,
[01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:17.220]  and there's negative stuff comes up from time to time.
[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:18.580]  And, you know, I told them about the camera
[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:19.700]  and I sent them images.
[01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:21.780]  I was like, look, you know, and here's the same,
[01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:24.500]  in the same lighting, you know, similar to the ones
[01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.900]  I published, although the ones I had originally,
[01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:28.180]  I was un-showered.
[01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:31.620]  There was, funny backstory is the ones I did publish
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:34.660]  when the sunlight was literally hitting me in the face.
[01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:36.740]  And it was like, and my first thought was,
[01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:39.860]  well, of course my face is blown out in the sunlight
[01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:41.540]  because it's bright sunlight right on my face.
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:43.940]  And I thought, well, wait, let me see what this iPad Air
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:45.780]  does with the exact same camera
[01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:47.540]  and exposed my face perfectly.
[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:51.700]  And literally 15 seconds later, but I looked terrible.
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:54.340]  And I was like, oh my God, the sun, I got it.
[01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:56.020]  I don't know what the weather's going to be like
[01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:56.740]  for the next two days.
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:59.860]  It ended up being overcast for the next days
[01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:00.900]  until the reviews came out.
[01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:03.540]  So I had to like quick scram, like run to get a shower,
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:04.100]  you know, like.
[01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:07.220]  See, the life of a reviewer is hard, John.
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:08.660]  It's not just free stuff.
[01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:11.620]  It's like, cause we just watched the Home Alone movies
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:12.420]  over Christmas.
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:14.100]  And I'm reminded it's like when they, you know,
[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:15.700]  realize the alarm clock was busted
[01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:16.740]  and they're late for the airport.
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:19.220]  It's like, I'm like, I'm like literally like out of my way.
[01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:21.540]  And I'm getting a shower.
[01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:24.020]  I need to take a photo before the sunlight passes,
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:26.660]  you know, and it was, it's actually, you know,
[01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:28.500]  it was, it was like aerobic exercise.
[01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:29.780]  No, but I told them and then they were like,
[01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:31.300]  oh yeah, that there is something, you know,
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:32.020]  we definitely see it.
[01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:32.580]  That's not right.
[01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:33.700]  Let me get back to you.
[01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:35.540]  But the, the, let me get back to you part
[01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:37.380]  took much longer than usual.
[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:39.300]  And then they got back to us, you know,
[01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:43.060]  pretty late before the reviews with a very similar statement,
[01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:46.100]  you know, that, you know, we've identified some problems
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:48.020]  and a future software fix will improve it.
[01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:49.220]  Something, something like that.
[01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:52.420]  Then I published and I started hearing from some of my sources
[01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:55.780]  who are unofficial, you know, just people inside Apple
[01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:58.500]  who read the site and some of them, you know, it's like,
[01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:02.420]  you know, one of the very lucky things of my career
[01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:05.140]  and having been doing this for long enough is that I've,
[01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:08.020]  you know, there's a level of trust and,
[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:10.740]  and certain people who I know and, you know, guess what?
[01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:15.780]  I wound up communicating with people who've used
[01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:19.780]  the studio display inside Apple while it's being developed
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:20.580]  at certain stages.
[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:23.620]  And they're like, yeah, my art, mine doesn't look like that,
[01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:27.700]  but mine's running and like a dev build of the firmware,
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:29.220]  you know, it's not up to date.
[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:32.420]  And that something, something happened late in the game.
[01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:33.540]  I still don't know detail.
[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:35.700]  I cannot, there's no backstory, you know,
[01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:38.340]  no betrayal of trust or spilling any guts.
[01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:41.140]  I don't know the details of what in the hell happened.
[01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:43.220]  And I realize how crazy this is, right?
[01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:46.340]  So I wrote up an update and said, what I've heard
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:49.220]  from little birdies who are familiar with the matter
[01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:53.140]  is that some kind of bug was introduced late in the game.
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:56.340]  And part of the miscommunication between like the reviewers
[01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:58.660]  and Apple PR is that they weren't even seeing it
[01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:01.780]  because they might've been using very late prototypes
[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:03.380]  that they, I don't know this for sure.
[01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:04.340]  I could be wrong.
[01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:07.060]  But I believe that they were running very late prototypes
[01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:09.540]  that they thought were truly commensurate
[01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:11.780]  with what will be the actual shipping ones,
[01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:14.740]  but aren't and have somewhat better,
[01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:17.060]  to some degree better image quality out of the camera.
[01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:19.300]  But what I've been told is that it should be at least
[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:22.740]  as good as the iPad Air and current iPad Pros.
[01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:24.900]  And it's not, and nobody, it doesn't see it.
[01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:26.020]  That's one of the weird things.
[01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:28.500]  And one of the things that made me like such a relief
[01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.820]  is it's not like some of the reviewers are saying
[01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:32.820]  the camera's not that great and others are saying,
[01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:35.140]  ah, it's just as good as the iPad.
[01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:36.660]  And it's like, no, everybody agrees.
[01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:37.860]  It's not as good as an iPad.
[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:40.100]  And it's kind of weird that Apple confirmed
[01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:41.380]  it's the same camera hardware
[01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:43.860]  because they usually don't confirm stuff like that, right?
[01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:48.020]  Like iFixit will take it apart
[01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:50.980]  and prove that it's the same component two days later,
[01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:55.540]  but they still won't tell you, or famously with RAM.
[01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:57.700]  They'll never ever, until recently,
[01:21:57.700 --> 01:21:58.740]  they would never ever tell you
[01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:00.340]  how much RAM was in an iPhone.
[01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:01.700]  They're like, ah, we don't talk about that.
[01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:03.620]  And it's like, well, somebody's gonna take it apart
[01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:06.100]  or run one of those utilities.
[01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:08.340]  You have apps in the app store
[01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:12.820]  that will tell you how much memory is on the system,
[01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:14.420]  but they will not confirm it.
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:15.300]  But they did confirm it.
[01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:16.900]  It's the state secret ever.
[01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:20.820]  So my basic take on the camera is,
[01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:23.700]  as it stands, it is truly subpar.
[01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:24.740]  I mean, it is poor.
[01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:27.940]  It is a poor camera that it seems inexplicably bad
[01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:31.540]  with skin tones and sharpness and noise
[01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:34.020]  and low light and sunlight.
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:38.980]  It, you know, bright sunlight and low light at night, bad.
[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:41.860]  It clearly does not produce as good an image quality
[01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:45.060]  as the iPad Air and iPad Pro front-facing camera,
[01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:46.900]  not the rear-facing camera.
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:49.940]  But I've been told that it, through firmware updates,
[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:52.660]  that something could be fixed and that it would,
[01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:56.420]  it probably won't match the iPad Air exactly
[01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:58.820]  because I think they're doing some different stuff,
[01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:00.900]  and I don't know this for sure,
[01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:04.900]  that makes sense where you're at a different distance
[01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:06.980]  from the studio display than you typically are
[01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:08.260]  from an iPad, right?
[01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:10.180]  It's, for me, my comfortable distance
[01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:12.820]  from a desktop display is roughly arm's length,
[01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:15.940]  like with my palm up, like giving the famous,
[01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:18.340]  you know, like telling somebody to stop.
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:20.660]  That's about how far I sit from a display.
[01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:24.740]  Nobody holds their iPad at arm's length distance, right?
[01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:26.420]  Well, I shouldn't say nobody,
[01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:27.700]  because we talked about vision problems.
[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:29.540]  Somebody somewhere has a vision problem
[01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:32.340]  where their perfect distance is arm's length,
[01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:33.780]  so let's acknowledge that.
[01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:36.500]  But typical iPad distance is closer.
[01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:38.180]  So I think they're doing something different
[01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:40.820]  with the cropping, with the ultra-wide for center stage,
[01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:43.460]  where it may not be the exact same image,
[01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:46.660]  but the image quality should be the same.
[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:48.340]  I believe that, why not?
[01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:53.220]  Yeah, I think it surely will get better,
[01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:55.620]  and I'm looking at your post again,
[01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:57.940]  and not the first batch of shots when you were in sunlight,
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:59.140]  but the second batch of shots
[01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:01.380]  where you're being artificially lit.
[01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:03.140]  Like, if you look at the first shot,
[01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:04.580]  you can see a couple of wrinkles,
[01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:05.700]  normal wrinkles in your forehead.
[01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:07.140]  You can make out some hair,
[01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:10.420]  and you know, the hair in your beard to some degree.
[01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:12.100]  And then you look at the studio display shot,
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:15.220]  and the whiter portion of your beard is like a blob.
[01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:18.820]  Your shirt loses any semblance of like weave
[01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:19.540]  or anything to it.
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:21.140]  It's almost like you put on a sheet,
[01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:22.500]  and it's a different color blue,
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:25.620]  by the way, even though it's the exact same shirt.
[01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:27.460]  Like, it's so abundantly obvious,
[01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:28.580]  the differences between the two.
[01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:31.540]  And by the way, the second shot of you
[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:33.860]  with the sheet that is cut like a shirt,
[01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:34.660]  rather than a shirt,
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:37.300]  it very much matches my experience in the Apple Store
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:38.500]  with the artificial light there.
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:42.020]  You know, your forehead is kind of like, is flattened.
[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:45.140]  Your beard is kind of like been, I don't know,
[01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:46.740]  unsharpened, de-sharpened.
[01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:48.580]  And your shirt, you can't see the weave at all.
[01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:50.020]  And that very much looks like the image
[01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:51.780]  that I took of myself at the Apple Store.
[01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:54.020]  And I got to imagine, you know, like I said,
[01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:57.300]  mine is shipping in a week or two.
[01:24:57.300 --> 01:25:00.500]  I would assume, based on zero insider knowledge,
[01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:03.220]  that by around the time mine comes in,
[01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:04.980]  I bet you will see at least a first crack
[01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:05.780]  at a fix at this,
[01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:07.380]  because I can't imagine that they're happy
[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:08.980]  about this PR at all.
[01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:12.420]  Yeah, and I think that part of the bad feeling about it
[01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:14.500]  is that first impressions are so important,
[01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:15.940]  and they're so hard to shake.
[01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:20.740]  And so I think the ultimate story will play out like this,
[01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:22.900]  that they will ship some sort of firmware update.
[01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:26.180]  I think the firmware update will improve image quality
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:29.780]  to be somewhat, or mostly, or fairly said commensurate
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:32.420]  with the iPad front-pacing cameras on the Air and Pro.
[01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:35.140]  I think center stage is going to improve.
[01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:37.620]  And my complaints about center stage,
[01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:39.220]  where I called it off center stage,
[01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:41.540]  because if I turn my head to the side and come back,
[01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:44.180]  I'm off center, and then three or four seconds later,
[01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:46.100]  literally, like, I'm not exaggerating.
[01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:47.300]  It's like four seconds.
[01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:51.140]  And then it sheepishly re-pans to put me in the center again,
[01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:53.300]  like, oh, sorry, I forgot we were moved.
[01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:56.660]  I've since learned some more about what they were
[01:25:56.660 --> 01:25:58.500]  thinking there and why it does that.
[01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:02.500]  And it's sort of, it's like what I was doing,
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:04.820]  which I wasn't trying to trick it.
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:06.580]  I literally, well, it's good, you know,
[01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:07.540]  you're the one on the show,
[01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:10.100]  but to avoid Casey-ing myself,
[01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:15.460]  I tend to keep any beverages I'm drinking off to the side.
[01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:16.740]  That's a smart plan.
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:17.860]  I have an L-shaped desk.
[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:19.220]  It's over to the right.
[01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:22.340]  And so while I was FaceTiming my son as a test,
[01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:24.820]  I went over to get a drink of a beverage,
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:26.980]  turned my head to the side and moved to the side
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:27.940]  and then came back.
[01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:28.900]  And now I'm off center.
[01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:29.700]  And I'm like, whoa.
[01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:33.220]  It wasn't like I was trying to trick it out.
[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:36.900]  I never ran into that with center stage on an iPad.
[01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:39.780]  There seems to be no way to fool it similarly.
[01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:42.260]  It seems like it's a feature, not a bug though.
[01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:44.420]  And that it's sort of like an anti,
[01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:46.660]  what they thought was an anti-fidget feature,
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:49.220]  like for somebody who is like,
[01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:51.140]  you're in a long Zoom meeting for work,
[01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:53.140]  an hour long meeting and you're there.
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:55.380]  And you know, you might slouch a little,
[01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:57.540]  you just, you know, you get a little restless in your chair.
[01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:01.220]  The center stage algorithm is different
[01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:04.260]  on the studio display than on the iPads by choice
[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:07.140]  for reasons that I think are good,
[01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:08.500]  but I think that they didn't,
[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:11.460]  that there are things people do in front of the camera,
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:12.980]  like turn your head to the side
[01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:14.260]  that they didn't anticipate.
[01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:17.620]  And that's clearly a software that they could fix, right?
[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:21.940]  Cause they could just delete all of the center stage code
[01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:23.940]  and just put the iPad code in
[01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:25.940]  and it would do the same thing the iPad does, right?
[01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.940]  So I'm sure that's fixable.
[01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:28.740]  I think it'll happen.
[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:32.820]  But I still think in my gut,
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:36.900]  I expect a better camera than the iPad front facing camera.
[01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:40.260]  Cause it's a $1,600 display.
[01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:42.500]  It is three quarters of an inch thick.
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:44.740]  And I just attribute some of the,
[01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:47.860]  not bad for a front facing camera,
[01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:50.820]  overall quality of iPad Pros and the iPad Air to,
[01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:52.980]  well, look at how thin this thing is, right?
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:55.700]  And the rear facing camera sticks out.
[01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:58.420]  Well, the front facing camera isn't going to stick out
[01:27:58.420 --> 01:27:59.780]  on an Apple device.
[01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:02.100]  So of course the image quality is a little less,
[01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:05.540]  but the studio display has all the thickness in the world
[01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:08.500]  for a webcam, you know?
[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:09.620]  So I kind of feel like,
[01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:12.980]  I still feel like even when they do quote unquote,
[01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:14.580]  fix the image quality,
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:17.060]  I'm still going to be mildly disappointed with it.
[01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:19.700]  I compared to what I think they could have built
[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:24.820]  into this thickness display for a $1,600 display
[01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:28.100]  and up without center stage.
[01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:30.900]  I just don't personally, you know,
[01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:32.980]  maybe other people do, maybe I'm the wrong market.
[01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:34.820]  I just don't see when I'm going to use this
[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:36.260]  where I really want center stage.
[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:39.860]  Well, so I think there's a few things to unpack there.
[01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:43.780]  And I think some of it is that the studio display
[01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:46.820]  has some really, really weird price anchoring
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:48.100]  going on around it, right?
[01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:52.100]  Because the LG Ultrafine, the 5K one is 1,300 bucks,
[01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:52.580]  I believe.
[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:55.380]  And honestly, I don't personally perceive it
[01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:56.660]  as a $1,300 monitor.
[01:28:56.660 --> 01:28:59.220]  I think at best it's a $1,000 monitor.
[01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:02.740]  And I think more realistically, it should probably,
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:05.140]  can maybe be even a little bit cheaper than that.
[01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:06.500]  Because as I said earlier, you know,
[01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:08.420]  everything about it is an exercise in mediocrity.
[01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:12.660]  And so when you compare yourself to the LG 5K,
[01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:16.020]  and MKVHD did a really good video on whether or not
[01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:18.740]  the studio display is a good deal.
[01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:21.860]  And the thesis of his video was, you know,
[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:22.900]  it depends on what you're after.
[01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:24.420]  And this is what you and I were talking about earlier.
[01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:26.260]  You know, if you're a PC user, no, it's a terrible deal.
[01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:28.340]  But if you're a Mac user who has a particular set
[01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:30.980]  of priorities, then yeah, it's actually a pretty good deal.
[01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:31.860]  Why is it a pretty good deal?
[01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:36.180]  Because it's only $300-ish more than the LG Ultrafine.
[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:41.060]  But then, if you consider the fact that I personally believe
[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:44.500]  that the LG Ultrafine is kind of drastically overpriced,
[01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:49.220]  then you start thinking about, well, for a $1,600 monitor,
[01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:50.820]  you know, shouldn't you have a better webcam?
[01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:52.980]  And then you end up exactly where you were saying, John.
[01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:55.940]  Like, it seems like you should be able to do better
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:56.740]  for $1,600.
[01:29:56.740 --> 01:30:02.820]  And I feel like I understand why Apple went the way
[01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:06.980]  of using known hardware and presumably a lot
[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:08.020]  of known software.
[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:10.100]  I mean, it's since come out that this thing is basically
[01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:14.180]  running iOS, or not exactly iOS, but very, very similar
[01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:17.620]  to iOS in, what was it, an A13 in the screen
[01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:18.340]  or something like that?
[01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:19.700]  I think it is iOS.
[01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:22.340]  It's just that they've, you know, retrofitted it
[01:30:22.340 --> 01:30:24.820]  to just do what they want to do.
[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:28.180]  But, like, literally the build number is exactly the same
[01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:29.620]  as 15.4.
[01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:30.740]  Right, exactly.
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:35.140]  But, you know, I think one thing that I was really excited
[01:30:35.140 --> 01:30:38.020]  when I was watching the presentation, I was really excited
[01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:38.900]  for Center Stage.
[01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:42.340]  And I think the reason that I'm super excited
[01:30:42.340 --> 01:30:44.660]  for Center Stage is because I have a slightly different
[01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:45.620]  use case than you do.
[01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:47.860]  And if you think about it, if I was going to get on a FaceTime
[01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:49.620]  call with, like, my parents or my grandparents
[01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:53.780]  or something like that, it's not just me or me and Aaron
[01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:57.380]  who will mostly stay still and mostly either be in the shot
[01:30:57.380 --> 01:30:57.940]  or not.
[01:30:57.940 --> 01:31:00.340]  And that's something that as grownups we can manage.
[01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:03.620]  But I have a seven-year-old and a four-year-old, and they
[01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:06.180]  will be running in and out of the shot and running around
[01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:07.300]  and so on and so forth.
[01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:12.660]  And so I think in that case, if you consider using this
[01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:15.940]  as, like, a family phone call device, then I think Center
[01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:18.100]  Stage could potentially make a lot of sense.
[01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:22.340]  But it also worries me a little bit that perhaps Center Stage
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:26.340]  as set up in the studio display is going to be a little
[01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:29.700]  lethargic for the needs of a parent of a seven-year-old
[01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:30.980]  and a four-year-old, you know?
[01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:32.900]  And I understand what you're saying about, well, if you're
[01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:35.220]  in a Zoom call and you're just rocking a teeny bit,
[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:38.260]  you don't want to have the distraction of the pseudo
[01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:40.420]  cameraman rocking back and forth as well.
[01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:41.860]  That's not my life.
[01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:43.940]  And in the same way that you kind of sort of don't have
[01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:46.980]  colleagues, I kind of sort of don't have colleagues.
[01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:49.060]  Marco and John and Mike accepted.
[01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:50.660]  In many ways, I'm by myself.
[01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:53.380]  And I don't often find myself on video calls.
[01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:56.660]  And so if I were to find myself on a video call, for me,
[01:31:56.660 --> 01:31:59.540]  that would be like a social thing, like a family thing.
[01:31:59.540 --> 01:32:02.900]  And in that case, that would be very useful to have
[01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:03.620]  Center Stage.
[01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:06.420]  So it's hard, as with all things, when you're at Apple
[01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:09.940]  scale, like, who do you emphasize or who do you really
[01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:11.780]  consider to be your core user?
[01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:14.420]  You know, what user story is the story that you really
[01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:15.140]  latch onto?
[01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:16.580]  And there's no right answer.
[01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:18.740]  And since Apple is allergic to settings, you know, it's not
[01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:21.140]  like I can flip back and forth between the John Gruber
[01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:22.980]  algorithm and the Casey Liss algorithm, you know?
[01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:25.220]  So you just got to do the best with what you got.
[01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:28.500]  But I really think the software is going to get better.
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:29.780]  I could make an argument.
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:31.620]  We talked about this on this week's ATP.
[01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:33.620]  I could make an argument that maybe there's a little too
[01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:35.220]  much software in the display.
[01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:39.060]  But on the flip side of that, I'm saying that from the
[01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:42.500]  privileged position of having a brand new MacBook Pro.
[01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:44.660]  You know, one of the great things about this display is
[01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:48.100]  that Center Stage and all those things that are unique to
[01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:53.060]  Apple Silicon can be run on an Intel powered MacBook or
[01:32:53.060 --> 01:32:53.860]  MacBook Pro.
[01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:57.460]  And that's really awesome and something that I don't think
[01:32:57.460 --> 01:32:59.940]  I've given an Apple enough credit for because I don't
[01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:00.580]  really care.
[01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:03.140]  I don't have any Intel devices around.
[01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:05.220]  Well, I guess Erin's adorable.
[01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:07.220]  I pass that down to her, but, you know, she's not ever going
[01:33:07.220 --> 01:33:08.500]  to plug into the display.
[01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:10.820]  So I don't have any Intel devices around anymore, so I
[01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:12.820]  don't really care that it's backwards compatible.
[01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:15.620]  But that is a very unusual thing for Apple to do and just
[01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:19.220]  be that cognizant in that forthcoming, for lack of better
[01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:22.900]  word, with older devices and saying, you know what, we've
[01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:23.700]  got you covered.
[01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:26.420]  We'll put the silicon in the display rather than you needing
[01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:28.740]  to have it on the thing the display is connected to.
[01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:30.500]  Yeah, that's definitely possible.
[01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:32.100]  I mean, I ran it.
[01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:34.020]  This is the other weird thing.
[01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:37.380]  I did run it on, did I mention this in my review?
[01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:37.940]  I think I did.
[01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:39.460]  Maybe in a footnote.
[01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:42.180]  Yeah, in a footnote that I initially hooked it up to my
[01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:45.780]  MacBook Pro, which is running Mac OS 12.2, which is
[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:48.900]  officially unsupported, but more or less just runs it like
[01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:49.700]  a dumb display.
[01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:52.500]  Like you can hook it up to a PC, you know, you just don't
[01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:55.380]  get center stage, but you still, you know, your PC connected
[01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:57.300]  by Thunderbolt will see a webcam.
[01:33:57.300 --> 01:33:58.500]  It'll hear the microphones.
[01:33:58.500 --> 01:33:59.860]  It'll, you know, play sound.
[01:33:59.860 --> 01:34:03.700]  I swear to God, I got better image quality, even though I
[01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:04.180]  did.
[01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:05.220]  There was something else.
[01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:08.260]  There's something else involved, something with the center
[01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:09.540]  stage part of it, right?
[01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:13.300]  And I think that's, it's not, I was like, is it because the
[01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:17.220]  M1 in my Mac was using, it was something, something, I think
[01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:20.020]  it's something to do with center stage and by plugging it
[01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:23.860]  into a Mac that didn't have 12.3 yet and center stage wasn't
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:26.260]  there, image quality was definitely a little better.
[01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:29.380]  There's no question in my mind, a little, not, but not like,
[01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:32.420]  still not like iPad quality, which is to me where the bar
[01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:33.060]  should be set.
[01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:33.700]  I get it though.
[01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:37.220]  I totally get your, and it always comes back to this with
[01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:40.660]  Apple products where Apple does not make everything, right?
[01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:43.460]  They, here's what we're going to make, you know, and Tim Cook's
[01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:47.460]  famous, you can spread our entire product line on a table.
[01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:52.020]  Well, now they need like a really big table, but, but still
[01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:53.700]  the mindset is still there.
[01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:55.300]  They don't make everything.
[01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:58.420]  And okay, they made an option for nano texture, you know,
[01:34:58.420 --> 01:35:00.980]  which is, you know, I'm glad it exists whether I end up
[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:01.620]  buying it or not.
[01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:03.860]  That speaks, you know, that's an option they didn't have to
[01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:04.100]  build.
[01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:07.620]  It is interesting to me that with the Pro Display XDR,
[01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:10.980]  nano texture is an extra thousand dollars and it's only
[01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:14.100]  only $300 on this.
[01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:16.660]  Like I said, it's a weird price anchoring on this thing.
[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:19.540]  But I totally get it though, that this display, because
[01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:24.340]  they've discontinued the 27 inch iMac, that this display is
[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:28.820]  the 27 inch display solution for anybody and everybody in
[01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:31.380]  the Mac world who wants a 27 inch display.
[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:34.980]  And I totally, totally know firsthand from my own family,
[01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:37.220]  you know, that there are lots and lots of families who have
[01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:42.100]  a 27 inch iMac as their family room computer and want to do
[01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:45.380]  things like you said, like call, let's call the grandparents
[01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:46.260]  on FaceTime.
[01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:49.620]  Come on over kids, you know, and, you know, they live across
[01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:51.460]  the state or across the country even.
[01:35:51.460 --> 01:35:53.620]  And, you know, it's somebody's birthday and let's get
[01:35:53.620 --> 01:35:54.660]  everybody in here.
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:58.580]  And center stage in theory is, should be way better than not
[01:35:58.580 --> 01:36:00.340]  having center stage in that scenario.
[01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:04.100]  And this monitor is supposed to fit that need and somebody
[01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:07.060]  like me, who's literally only using it for work and no longer
[01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:09.380]  has little kids, you know, I don't need that.
[01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:11.780]  I totally acknowledge that, that, you know, this isn't
[01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:14.420]  designed necessarily for my exact needs, but I get it.
[01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:18.180]  If you're going to do it one way, maybe doing the center
[01:36:18.180 --> 01:36:19.540]  stage thing is a good solution.
[01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:20.340]  I get it.
[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:23.860]  And actually that makes me think of a question I've wanted
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:24.580]  to talk to you about.
[01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:30.420]  Do you begrudge the death of the 27-inch iMac, because I
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:35.140]  think if you look at Apple's lineup right now, that's a pretty
[01:36:35.140 --> 01:36:36.580]  big hole that they left.
[01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:37.220]  Yeah.
[01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:40.420]  But, and I think the biggest, the hole is predominantly,
[01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:44.180]  what if you don't want a laptop, but you want like an M1 Max
[01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:47.060]  or potentially, I guess, an M1 Ultra, but particularly an M1
[01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:50.500]  Max, or you maybe are backed into an M1 Max because you want
[01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:53.780]  more than 16 gigs of RAM or what have you, then you really
[01:36:53.780 --> 01:36:56.500]  don't have a good answer for that right now.
[01:36:57.060 --> 01:37:00.260]  But I don't find this to be too alarming because I got to
[01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:03.380]  imagine that there's going to be a new Mac Mini sooner rather
[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:06.420]  than later that either will have an M2 that supports more
[01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:09.140]  than 16 gigs of RAM, or maybe they'll offer an M1 Max or
[01:37:09.140 --> 01:37:09.940]  something like that.
[01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:14.340]  So I really feel like this hole in the lineup for a 27-inch
[01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:19.220]  computer that's pseudo-professional, I think it's going to get
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:20.100]  filled real soon.
[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:22.660]  I think it'll be filled by a beefier Mac Mini.
[01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:25.940]  And if you leave aside the fact that this hypothetical
[01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:29.860]  forthcoming Mac Mini in Studio Display combo, it isn't
[01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:33.060]  all-in-one, which our mutual friend John Siracusa was very
[01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:36.340]  perturbed about, but leaving aside that it's not all-in-one,
[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:38.980]  I feel like a slightly better Mac Mini as paired with Studio
[01:37:38.980 --> 01:37:44.260]  Display pretty nicely fills the hole left by the 27-inch iMac.
[01:37:44.260 --> 01:37:46.580]  But I'm curious what your thoughts are on that.
[01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:47.460]  Am I missing the boat?
[01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:51.380]  Or I mean, again, today it's kind of crummy, but tomorrow,
[01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:53.780]  figuratively speaking, I got to imagine this hole will be
[01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:54.340]  filled, no?
[01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:58.500]  Well, I think that this is a better lineup.
[01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:02.900]  And you're putting both of us in dangerous territory because
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:06.740]  the people who really want Apple to make an all-in-one
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:09.700]  27-inch iMac really, really want it.
[01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:12.660]  I mean, they're probably gin martini drinkers as well.
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:13.620]  It must be.
[01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:14.100]  It must be.
[01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:15.620]  They're angry.
[01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:18.100]  Not angry, but they're adamant.
[01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:21.780]  Again, in a hypothetical world app where Apple makes
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:27.780]  everything it could make, they would make both a 27-inch
[01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:32.900]  iMac right now with MacBook Pro guts, right?
[01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:37.220]  Like the 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro guts where you could get
[01:38:37.940 --> 01:38:39.940]  the, you know, what are the options?
[01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:42.900]  You get a regular M1 or an M1 Max.
[01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:43.460]  Oh, God.
[01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:46.340]  You know, for podcasting, the Max name is so terrible.
[01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:47.300]  It's so bad.
[01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:47.940]  It's so bad.
[01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:48.820]  It looks fine.
[01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:51.460]  So when you're reading it, it always reads like maximum.
[01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:52.180]  Yeah, sure.
[01:38:52.180 --> 01:38:54.580]  But when you're saying it on a podcast, it always sounds
[01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:56.020]  like you're pluralizing Mac.
[01:38:58.100 --> 01:38:59.140]  I wish they hadn't done that.
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:00.260]  But anyway, yeah.
[01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:03.460]  So something like that where it scales exactly like the
[01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:08.580]  MacBook Pro lines, MacBook Pro 14 and 16-inch guts in a
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:12.420]  27-inch iMac where the range would go from lower price with
[01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:17.060]  a regular M1 and only 16 gigs of RAM to an M1 Max with up
[01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:19.220]  to 64 gigs of RAM and all the performance.
[01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:23.300]  It would be great if they made that in addition to the
[01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:24.340]  studio display.
[01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:25.060]  Totally.
[01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:28.580]  And, you know, I know firsthand you don't have to write
[01:39:28.580 --> 01:39:29.140]  to me again.
[01:39:29.140 --> 01:39:29.700]  I get it.
[01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:30.500]  I've heard from you.
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:30.820]  No, no.
[01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:31.540]  And I'm not complaining.
[01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:32.340]  I love getting email.
[01:39:32.340 --> 01:39:35.380]  I love getting email from you because it helps me know what
[01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:35.860]  people want.
[01:39:35.860 --> 01:39:37.700]  I know that you're out there and I know that that's what
[01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:38.260]  you would want.
[01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:41.060]  But if they're only going to make one and for many, many
[01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:44.260]  years, as we talked earlier on the show, the one was the
[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:47.860]  27-inch iMac, which was not a solution if you wanted a desktop
[01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:49.860]  display for a MacBook, right?
[01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:52.340]  And they took out target display mode for reasons.
[01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:54.740]  And it seemed foolish anyway.
[01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:58.100]  I mean, we used to, you know, I know everybody with a podcast
[01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:02.260]  has made jokes that I would buy a 27-inch iMac and use it as
[01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:04.580]  a display if I could, but I can't.
[01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:07.380]  And just ignore the Mac inside.
[01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:11.300]  Well, we're sort of doing that now where we're ignoring the
[01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:13.700]  A13 computer that's inside, right?
[01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:17.860]  There is sort of what could be a Mac inside, right?
[01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:22.420]  The Mac dev units last summer or two summers ago were A12Xs,
[01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:24.820]  so there's an A13 in this son of a bitch, you know?
[01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:28.420]  It kind of is.
[01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:31.860]  But if they were only going to do one or the other, this
[01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:33.780]  clearly is the way.
[01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:37.540]  And it's, you know, it's a modular way of thinking.
[01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:41.540]  And all in one, well, define all in one.
[01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:44.260]  I really need to write this as a follow-up on Daring Firewall
[01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:49.780]  because even the 24-inch iMac, okay, that's all in one, right?
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:51.460]  Just do that, but 27 inches.
[01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:56.580]  Well, it's not all in one, though, because it has a really
[01:40:56.580 --> 01:41:02.420]  big external power brick and literally the size.
[01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:06.980]  It's almost exactly the size and weight of an Apple TV 4K.
[01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:10.100]  You know, I've stacked one on top of it.
[01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:11.700]  It's almost the exact same footprint.
[01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:15.780]  I didn't get my scale out, but putting one in one hand and
[01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:17.140]  one in the other, it's about the same.
[01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:22.420]  So it's, you know, what would be the difference if they
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:28.180]  shrunk the Mac Mini to the size of Apple TV 4K and using
[01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:30.020]  that to power an external display?
[01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:32.580]  Well, that's the exact same thing that the 24-inch iMac is,
[01:41:32.580 --> 01:41:33.140]  right?
[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:38.180]  The Apple Studio display, remarkably, in my opinion, has
[01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:39.460]  no power brick.
[01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:42.260]  It is just a cable that comes out of the back.
[01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:45.140]  It's just a regular cable that goes in the wall, and then
[01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:48.580]  you can plug a MacBook in and get 96-watt charging out of
[01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:49.780]  it with no brick.
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:53.460]  So define what's all in one, right?
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:58.500]  Like, so if you have a Mac Mini and you connect it to this
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:00.260]  display, you've got one thing.
[01:42:00.260 --> 01:42:03.940]  Okay, the Mac Mini, at least the one we know so far with the
[01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:09.700]  M1, is bigger than the 24-inch iMac's power brick.
[01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:12.340]  But it is a brick, and it is external.
[01:42:12.980 --> 01:42:17.140]  Either way, you've got a thing external to the display on
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:18.820]  your desk, you know?
[01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:21.140]  See, and I totally agree with you, but then, you know,
[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:23.220]  channeling my inner John Syracuse, so then the argument
[01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:26.180]  would be, well, they never used a brick on prior 27-inch
[01:42:26.180 --> 01:42:28.740]  devices, so obviously they wouldn't this time, duh.
[01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:32.660]  Yeah, but they were a lot thicker, you know?
[01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:35.060]  I'm right there with you, I'm right there with you.
[01:42:35.060 --> 01:42:37.460]  They were like, it's so, it's edge-to-edge thin, it's so
[01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:41.060]  thin, and it was, you know, and I get it, I like that my
[01:42:41.060 --> 01:42:45.540]  5K iMac bulbous sort of pregnant back, I like the way that
[01:42:45.540 --> 01:42:48.820]  it, I think it's worth it to make it taper to the edges,
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:52.020]  but the middle of the thing was, you know, it was not all
[01:42:52.020 --> 01:42:55.620]  in one thickness thin, and that's what Apple wants to make.
[01:42:55.620 --> 01:42:57.620]  So again, you could say, well, you don't need the brick,
[01:42:57.620 --> 01:43:00.900]  you could just put a big box on the back of the thing, but
[01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:02.820]  now you're talking about a thing Apple doesn't want to
[01:43:02.820 --> 01:43:04.900]  make, right? They don't want to put a box on the back of the
[01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:08.740]  thing, and this modularity really solves the biggest
[01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:12.420]  problem. If, again, they could make both, both the 27-inch
[01:43:12.420 --> 01:43:15.940]  iMac and this display, but 80% at least, I mean, Apple
[01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:19.380]  doesn't break it down, but, you know, common sense tells you
[01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:23.700]  most people buy MacBooks. Some little birdie info that I'm
[01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:27.940]  privy to says it was at least 80% in 2021, and that Apple
[01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:32.100]  expects that number to continue going up towards more than
[01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:36.500]  80% of MacBooks in 2022. They expect, or max total, they
[01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:39.620]  expect to be MacBooks of some sort. Even though their
[01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:44.980]  desktop game is better than it has been in memory, that's
[01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:46.980]  just the way the world is going, and now they have a
[01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:50.580]  display that can plug into any MacBook. It's great, and if
[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:52.980]  you do really want a desktop, you don't want to plug a
[01:43:52.980 --> 01:43:56.660]  MacBook in, you want to plug a desktop in, the modularity of
[01:43:56.660 --> 01:44:00.500]  this is phenomenal, and I think it's only going to be even
[01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:04.820]  better once the M2 Mac Minis come out, which I think, I
[01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:08.900]  don't know that they're going to go lower in price, but it
[01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:12.580]  should fill in some of the gaps in the middle of, well, I
[01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:15.940]  want a Mac Mini, but I actually, you know, I want like 64
[01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:19.620]  gigs of RAM. Exactly. They'll have that, and then you can
[01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:22.660]  buy it, and yes, it's not all in one, but you've just got
[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:31.700]  one thing, one box, and nobody talks about it, but I feel
[01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:34.180]  like there have been two stories with Apple's Apple
[01:44:34.180 --> 01:44:38.580]  Silicon Macs. There was the first round in 2020 at the end
[01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:45.460]  where they put the M1 chips into exactly the same chassis
[01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:48.340]  as their Intel ones, and I've talked to people at Apple,
[01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:51.460]  this was done for multiple reasons, but one of them was
[01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:55.860]  secrecy, that they did not want, you know, anybody, their
[01:44:55.860 --> 01:45:00.420]  competitors or Intel to know that, you know, everybody knew
[01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:03.300]  that it seems, you know, for years, we were all, you know,
[01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:05.860]  there was like half of all of our podcasts, when is Apple
[01:45:05.860 --> 01:45:09.380]  going to move from Intel to Apple Silicon, right? Look at
[01:45:09.380 --> 01:45:12.260]  these Geekbench numbers, there's bananas, my phone gets a
[01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:15.060]  higher score, but they wanted to keep it secret inside the
[01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:18.980]  company, and the best way to keep it secret was to keep the
[01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:24.900]  hardware completely unchanged to the maximum level, except
[01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:29.380]  for the Silicon architecture and the MacBook Air, the 13
[01:45:29.380 --> 01:45:34.820]  inch MacBook Pro, the Mac Mini, what else was there? Did they
[01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:38.500]  do the M1? Was there an old looking 16 inch? Yeah, there
[01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:41.300]  must have been, right? I think that's right, yeah. They all
[01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:45.060]  looked exactly the same, and then starting with the iMac, 24
[01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:48.660]  inch iMac last year, we started seeing the first Mac hardware
[01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:52.020]  designed from the ground up around Apple Silicon, and guess
[01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:55.860]  what? It's really impressive, right? Who would have thunk it?
[01:45:55.860 --> 01:46:00.900]  It's crazy thin, like you could not build the 24 inch iMac out
[01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:05.780]  of Intel Silicon, you couldn't do it, and I think that the 14
[01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:09.860]  and 16 inch MacBook Pros that you and I have now, 14 inch,
[01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:14.660]  obviously those could be Intel because, you know, they
[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:17.060]  actually got thicker and heavier because they sort of went
[01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:21.540]  like more, let's give Pros Pro features. So I feel like that
[01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:24.740]  throws people off, but I feel like at the consumer level, the
[01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:28.580]  iMac shows the way and that they want to, they want to make
[01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:32.100]  crazy thin, light, small things that they couldn't build before.
[01:46:32.100 --> 01:46:36.660]  And so, the next round of consumer MacBooks, whether
[01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:38.820]  they, I don't know if they're going to call it MacBook Air
[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:41.780]  anymore, I really think they're going to get rid of the 13
[01:46:41.780 --> 01:46:45.540]  inch MacBook Pro branding, because I think that they've
[01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:49.860]  clarified Pro, okay, we really mean Pro, Pro means Pro. And,
[01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:55.220]  you know, maybe they'll call like the higher end 13 inch
[01:46:55.220 --> 01:46:59.140]  MacBook, you know, that is, you know, like what the two port
[01:46:59.140 --> 01:47:02.340]  13 inch Pro was, maybe they'll call it the MacBook Studio,
[01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:05.620]  right? They've introduced, they've introduced this new
[01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:09.460]  word studio that sort of occupies the prosumer space, you
[01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:12.980]  know, I don't know, that's just a spitball. Names never, ever,
[01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:16.740]  ever leaked to me. So, if there actually is a MacBook Studio,
[01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:19.460]  it's truly a guess on my part, but I would expect the new
[01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:23.940]  MacBook Air to be like the 12 inch adorable, super, super
[01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:27.140]  thin, crazy thin. This is insane. It's insane how thin this
[01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:27.540]  thing is.
[01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:31.940]  Yeah, and I loved that computer so much. So, at the time in
[01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:34.500]  which I bought the 12 inch MacBook, which I call the MacBook
[01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:36.900]  Adorable, that's the, like you said earlier, that's the one
[01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:39.700]  USB-C port and a headphone jack. That's literally all the
[01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:42.100]  connectivity it had, physical connectivity it had. I bought
[01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:46.100]  that when I was, when I had a 27 inch iMac, and that was my,
[01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:51.300]  the Adorable was my iPad and my portable computer, because at
[01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:54.500]  the time I'd kind of fallen out of love with the iPad. I tend
[01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:57.300]  to kind of fall in and out of love with iPad for whatever
[01:47:57.300 --> 01:48:00.740]  reason. But one way or another, I had used that as my satellite
[01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:05.140]  computer, and it was a fortune. It was like $3,000 or something
[01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:08.100]  like that. It was not particularly well specced. It was
[01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:13.620]  dog slow, and I loved it. Gosh, did I love that computer. I
[01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:18.500]  like this. I love this 14 inch MacBook Pro more because it has
[01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:23.380]  basically no compromises. But the 12 inch MacBook, and my
[01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:26.340]  understanding is, what was the 11 inch PowerBook? Do I have
[01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:26.740]  that right?
[01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:30.180]  No, there was an 11 inch MacBook Air, and there was a 12
[01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:33.540]  inch PowerBook many, many, many, many years before.
[01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:36.340]  Okay, so all of these are cut from a similar cloth, right?
[01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:39.940]  Like, let's get maximum portability, everything else be
[01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:43.620]  damned. Ports be damned, battery life, anything else. Speed,
[01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:46.820]  doesn't matter. We don't care. We want something super crazy
[01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:50.020]  portable. And that's what that thing was. And I could put that
[01:48:50.020 --> 01:48:53.780]  thing in like a bag or a backpack. I think once or twice
[01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:56.100]  I might have asked Erin to carry it in a purse for some
[01:48:56.100 --> 01:48:59.460]  reason or another. Like, it was preposterously thin and
[01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:03.060]  preposterously great. And if you didn't mind waiting an hour
[01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:06.980]  to accomplish anything. And she still uses that as her primary
[01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:09.220]  computer because Erin's computing needs are extremely
[01:49:09.220 --> 01:49:11.860]  small these days. I was listening to you talking about
[01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:14.580]  how Amy Jane is mostly on an iPad, and about the only reason
[01:49:14.580 --> 01:49:18.340]  she uses a computer computer is for writing her own email or
[01:49:18.340 --> 01:49:20.580]  something. And I feel like with Erin, it's a very similar
[01:49:20.580 --> 01:49:24.660]  thing. And so anyways, I loved that MacBook, MacBook Adorable,
[01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:29.220]  but that was the definition of compromise. It was compromised
[01:49:29.220 --> 01:49:33.460]  top to bottom. And I can't help but wonder, what would it look
[01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:36.900]  like if it wasn't nothing but compromise? Like it surely
[01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:40.180]  wouldn't be as powerful as a 14-inch MacBook Pro. But what
[01:49:40.180 --> 01:49:43.380]  if it was in the ballpark? What if it was close?
[01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:48.420]  Well, just forget about all of the Macs and Ultra chips,
[01:49:48.420 --> 01:49:52.580]  right? Just think just the M2, right? Or just the M1, right?
[01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:56.020]  Like the thing that it's fascinating to me, and I think
[01:49:56.020 --> 01:49:58.980]  it just speaks to the interest in the iPhone and the fact that
[01:49:58.980 --> 01:50:02.340]  they have to make a hundred million of them a quarter or
[01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:07.220]  more, you know, that the iPhone, I mean, that the iPhone
[01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:11.620]  industrial designs tend to always leak, right? And there's
[01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:14.500]  sort of a strong consensus about what the iPhone 14 is
[01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:17.700]  going to look like already, you know, instead of a notch, it's
[01:50:17.700 --> 01:50:20.500]  going to have like a sort of oval hole punch, but the same
[01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:23.860]  size, blah, blah, blah. But it's fascinating to me that like
[01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:27.460]  the Mac stuff has not been leaking. Nobody knew what the
[01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:30.580]  iMac 24-inch was going to look like, right? And it was
[01:50:30.580 --> 01:50:34.020]  there. It was a lot of fun that, hey, it's in these colors.
[01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:37.140]  It's crazy thin. This is, you know, it was a lot of fun that
[01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:40.820]  it was a surprise. The 14 and 16-inch MacBooks, we knew they
[01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:42.820]  were coming, but nobody knew what they were going to look
[01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:45.620]  like. Like they were surprised. And we've got all these
[01:50:45.620 --> 01:50:49.460]  rumors about upcoming M2 consumer MacBooks, you know,
[01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:53.140]  from Mark Gurman and Ming-Chi Kuo and other people. And,
[01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:55.060]  you know, I don't doubt any of them. I think they're all
[01:50:55.060 --> 01:50:57.220]  right. But they don't know what they're called, right?
[01:50:57.220 --> 01:51:00.340]  When they say, like when Gurman says, you know, that he
[01:51:00.340 --> 01:51:04.580]  expects MacBook Air later this year, he has no idea if it's
[01:51:04.580 --> 01:51:06.820]  actually going to be called MacBook Air. That's the sort of
[01:51:06.820 --> 01:51:09.540]  thing that does not come from those sources.
[01:51:09.540 --> 01:51:12.020]  And look at the studio. The studio is the same thing, right?
[01:51:12.020 --> 01:51:14.820]  Because we didn't know if it was a squat Mac Pro or a tall
[01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:16.820]  Mac Mini or where it would end up. And it was the same
[01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:19.460]  story. Yeah. Yeah. And he had that to some degree, right?
[01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:21.860]  Like he was right about it, but he didn't have like a
[01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:26.500]  description of it. I think it's fascinating that people
[01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:29.620]  seem to bea lot of people seem to be expecting like an M2
[01:51:29.620 --> 01:51:32.980]  MacBook Air to look just like the MacBook Air today. I don't
[01:51:32.980 --> 01:51:35.460]  think thatI think there's zero chance of that. None.
[01:51:35.460 --> 01:51:37.780]  Because the whole reason the MacBook Air looks the way it
[01:51:37.780 --> 01:51:41.700]  does is it was designed around Intel thermals. And the
[01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:46.980]  current M1 MacBook Air is based on that design for Intel
[01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:51.940]  thermals and capabilities and for ease of introduction and
[01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:54.500]  secrecy and whatever other reasons. They just did the first
[01:51:54.500 --> 01:51:58.660]  round by putting the M1 into that design. Now we can see
[01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:00.580]  what they could design from the ground up. And I would
[01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:03.300]  expect it to look as different from a MacBook Air as the 24
[01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:06.900]  inch iMac looks from all previous iMacs, like shockingly
[01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:11.220]  thin. And the other thing that we know, because they made
[01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:15.620]  the 12 inch MacBook, aka adorable, or no adjective,
[01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:18.740]  whatever you want to call it, we know they want to make
[01:52:18.740 --> 01:52:24.980]  crazy, thin, small, light Macs, right? MacBooks. And because
[01:52:24.980 --> 01:52:29.780]  they've got the M1 in the iPad Pro and now the iPad Air, we
[01:52:29.780 --> 01:52:33.940]  know it can run without any cooling at all and never get
[01:52:33.940 --> 01:52:38.180]  warm to the touch in a crazy thin device that's super
[01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:41.700]  lightweight. Yeah. And I think you're exactly right that
[01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:44.340]  they're surely going to change the industrial design and
[01:52:44.340 --> 01:52:47.700]  surely the requirements will be quite a bit different. And you
[01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:51.940]  know, I think right now we're still very clearly in a
[01:52:51.940 --> 01:52:54.900]  transition. And yes, that's obvious. But what I mean is,
[01:52:54.900 --> 01:52:57.140]  you know, what you were saying about the industrial design
[01:52:57.140 --> 01:52:59.780]  being a holdover for the MacBook Air and the 13 inch
[01:52:59.780 --> 01:53:02.660]  MacBook Pro, I mean, it's exactly right. And additionally,
[01:53:02.660 --> 01:53:06.740]  the M1, while a phenomenal chip, the M1, no adjective, it
[01:53:06.740 --> 01:53:09.860]  does have some somewhat severe constraints, most
[01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:13.220]  particularly the 16 gigs of RAM. And now in a lot of use
[01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:17.300]  cases, and perhaps most, if not almost all use cases, 16
[01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:20.980]  gigs of RAM is fine. I was looking just yesterday, the
[01:53:20.980 --> 01:53:25.140]  day before I run iStat menus on my Macs because I kind of
[01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:27.700]  like to keep track of nerdy things like that. And it does a
[01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:30.100]  really good job keeping a historical graph of certain
[01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:32.580]  things, including memory use. And I was looking at it and I
[01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:37.780]  have a 64 gig 14 inch MacBook Pro, if you will. And I don't
[01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:41.220]  think I've ever crossed over half of my memory. You know,
[01:53:41.220 --> 01:53:45.380]  I've never gone over like 32 gigs of usage. And so even me
[01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:47.460]  as a software developer, and granted there are other things
[01:53:47.460 --> 01:53:50.980]  that are much more taxing, but as a person who lives in Xcode,
[01:53:50.980 --> 01:53:55.220]  I don't probably need more than 32 gigs of RAM. And so this
[01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:58.100]  is what I'm saying. Like all the people that I speak to that
[01:53:58.100 --> 01:54:02.420]  are really grumpy about the lack of a real prosume desktop,
[01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:05.220]  because they argue that the studio is too much and the
[01:54:05.220 --> 01:54:08.020]  Mini is too little, and they're looking for the Goldilocks in
[01:54:08.020 --> 01:54:11.860]  the middle. I feel like the Air and the 13 inch Pro, if it
[01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:14.660]  persists, are kind of in a similar boat as the Mac Mini,
[01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:18.420]  where I feel like, yeah, today you're right. They're kind of
[01:54:18.420 --> 01:54:22.660]  hamstrung a little bit. But be it because the M1 Max arrives
[01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:24.820]  in them, or as you said, Jon, and I think that's more likely
[01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:28.980]  what the M2 arrives in these devices, even leaving aside the
[01:54:28.980 --> 01:54:31.700]  industrial design, I think that there'll be far fewer
[01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:34.740]  compromises and they'll be much more appealing to much more
[01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:38.820]  people. And that I think will close some of the holes, some
[01:54:38.820 --> 01:54:41.620]  of which are gaping, in the lineup. And I think that if
[01:54:41.620 --> 01:54:44.820]  people can just be patient for another 6 to 12 months, based
[01:54:44.820 --> 01:54:47.780]  just on gut, based on no insider information, I really
[01:54:47.780 --> 01:54:51.060]  think this lineup, whether or not it has a quote unquote
[01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:54.980]  all-in-one 27 inch answer, I think the lineup broadly,
[01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:58.740]  though, will cover darn near everything from the thousand
[01:54:58.740 --> 01:55:02.180]  dollar MacBook Air that will probably be preposterously fast,
[01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:04.260]  all the way through the forthcoming Mac Pro, which will
[01:55:04.260 --> 01:55:07.380]  probably be preposterously fast and preposterously expensive
[01:55:07.380 --> 01:55:08.340]  and everywhere in between.
[01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:10.980]  Yeah, and crazy thin. I just think people are going to be
[01:55:10.980 --> 01:55:14.260]  blown away by how thin the air is. And I have no inside birdie
[01:55:14.260 --> 01:55:17.620]  information on this at all. I just know what Apple likes to
[01:55:17.620 --> 01:55:20.740]  build. They like to build things crazy. And I really think
[01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:26.500]  it's been a clarifying series of years of them reinvesting
[01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:29.940]  in putting the Pro and Pro on the MacBook. So, okay, let's
[01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:33.380]  make them more different, right? Like that 13 inch MacBook Pro
[01:55:33.380 --> 01:55:38.660]  with two ports, it epitomizes their sort of muddling of the
[01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:42.580]  consumer and Pro lineups, right? They call it a MacBook Pro,
[01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:45.060]  but it's only got two ports and it always had less fewer
[01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:49.380]  features. It didn't have the beloved touch bar. I think that
[01:55:49.380 --> 01:55:52.500]  product branding has got to be gone. I think it's gone. And
[01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:54.980]  then you just, you know, like there's no confusion on the
[01:55:54.980 --> 01:56:00.260]  iPhone side between iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, right? The
[01:56:00.260 --> 01:56:03.220]  Pros are made of a different material and they have three
[01:56:03.220 --> 01:56:07.060]  cameras instead of two cameras and they cost a lot more. Just
[01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:10.660]  bring that same clarity to the MacBook branding and, you know,
[01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:14.500]  have an air and maybe just bring back the plain old MacBook or
[01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:16.500]  I don't know what they'll do branding wise, but just make it
[01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:19.860]  really clear and say, okay, these 14, 16 inch Pro models,
[01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:24.100]  lots of ports, all the power, max chips, you can get up to 64
[01:56:24.100 --> 01:56:28.020]  gigs of RAM. If you want the power, there you go. Have at it
[01:56:28.020 --> 01:56:33.060]  $2,000 and up. And here's our consumer ones. Crazy thin,
[01:56:33.060 --> 01:56:37.380]  right? Crazy thin, crazy light, you know, doesn't have the
[01:56:37.380 --> 01:56:41.700]  power, but starts at $1,000. And don't, the thing I'm, you
[01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:45.220]  know, who knows, maybe they'll ship the M2 Mac mini and it
[01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:48.180]  will literally be the same footprint. The Mac mini we know
[01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:51.220]  and love. It's just now it's got the M2. Maybe it'll come in
[01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:55.780]  space gray again and whatever, but don't sleep on that as
[01:56:55.780 --> 01:56:59.780]  something that could potentially shrink, right? Like they could
[01:56:59.780 --> 01:57:02.980]  totally make it like the Mac nano. Cause think about it,
[01:57:02.980 --> 01:57:08.660]  like the A15 in the, in an iPhone is super powerful chip.
[01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:12.340]  It's single core is I guess better than, you know, the M1
[01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:17.300]  series. It, look at how small the iPhone 13 mini is, and it
[01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:21.860]  has a battery and a display. Like I really think that, I
[01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:28.660]  think Apple Silicon chips at the, the, the non max, non ultra,
[01:57:28.660 --> 01:57:31.060]  okay. It's not two of them together. It's not four of them
[01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:34.100]  together or something like that. It's just, just one, which
[01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:38.420]  is plenty powerful enough for most people are so crazy small
[01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:42.580]  that like the Mac mini could now be defined entirely by the
[01:57:42.580 --> 01:57:45.380]  ports. Like what ports do we want to put in the back? And
[01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:49.620]  the, that defines the shape, not the thermals, not the chip,
[01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:56.020]  just the ports. I, and if, if I'm right again, pure spitball
[01:57:56.020 --> 01:57:58.900]  and the Mac mini becomes the Mac nano, even if they don't
[01:57:58.900 --> 01:58:02.020]  rebrand it, but if it shrinks, then the, the complaints about
[01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:06.580]  the studio display not being all in one go to me, go away. If
[01:58:06.580 --> 01:58:09.380]  they can shrink the Mac mini to be the size of the brick on the
[01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:13.140]  iMac 24, then what's, what's the complaint about? I mean, I
[01:58:13.140 --> 01:58:19.620]  guess price, if, if it's a $1,600 display plus a $700 to
[01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:24.420]  start Mac mini you're at 2,300 already. And that's more than
[01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:28.660]  the base price of the old 27 inch iMac. I don't know, but, so
[01:58:28.660 --> 01:58:31.620]  maybe it's, you know, but there's inflation and, you know,
[01:58:31.620 --> 01:58:34.180]  it's Apple. What are we going to do? Complain? It's Apple.
[01:58:34.180 --> 01:58:36.500]  Yeah. Anyway, let me take a break here. Thank our third and

[01:59:49.700 --> 01:59:53.620]  slash talk show. My thanks to Memberful. You're probably
[01:59:53.620 --> 01:59:56.660]  already a member at a Memberful site, or two, or three, or
[01:59:56.660 --> 01:59:59.860]  four, or like me, like six, and you may not even know it
[01:59:59.860 --> 02:00:02.980]  because their branding is so seamless. So hey, let's, we're
[02:00:02.980 --> 02:00:05.860]  at the two-hour mark, but I wanted to talk about you or, you
[02:00:05.860 --> 02:00:07.460]  know, this is the reason I invited you, one of the reasons
[02:00:07.460 --> 02:00:09.380]  I invited you on. I know you had strong opinions about the
[02:00:09.380 --> 02:00:12.260]  displays, but no, but I want to turn this into, I want to do
[02:00:12.260 --> 02:00:14.900]  more on this show and get people on when they have
[02:00:14.900 --> 02:00:17.940]  something to promote, right? It's, you know, and you've got a
[02:00:17.940 --> 02:00:22.340]  new app that I think is very clever and that you've been, to
[02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:26.500]  me, underselling on your own podcast, ATP. Tell my audience
[02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:29.780]  about your app. Sure, so I've written an app and released it
[02:00:29.780 --> 02:00:33.380]  to the app store called Masker Aid, and it's, it's the two
[02:00:33.380 --> 02:00:36.340]  words, masker and aid, mashed together, but it's a play on,
[02:00:36.340 --> 02:00:39.140]  you know, mask or aid, if you will. Anyways, the idea of the
[02:00:39.140 --> 02:00:42.100]  app is, let's say you have a photograph, but you want to
[02:00:42.100 --> 02:00:45.860]  obscure maybe a face or maybe an object or something like
[02:00:45.860 --> 02:00:49.300]  that. You want to obscure part of the photo and what Masker Aid
[02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:52.980]  lets you do is you can load up this photo in the app and it
[02:00:52.980 --> 02:00:55.940]  will help you put emoji on top of the photo. And then
[02:00:55.940 --> 02:00:57.700]  something that I've been terrible about publicizing is
[02:00:57.700 --> 02:01:00.340]  that it'll automatically strip all the metadata off the photo
[02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:03.940]  as well. So lens information, location information, more
[02:01:03.940 --> 02:01:07.220]  importantly than anything else, I'd argue. And so this way it
[02:01:07.220 --> 02:01:11.620]  can, it's a really fast and easy way to help you obscure or
[02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:14.500]  occlude things that you don't want shown before you share
[02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:16.980]  this photo to, say, Instagram or Twitter or something like
[02:01:16.980 --> 02:01:20.260]  that. And the genesis for this was, you know, as I mentioned
[02:01:20.260 --> 02:01:22.820]  earlier, I have a seven year old and a four year old and my
[02:01:22.820 --> 02:01:26.260]  son, the elder, when he was four, you know, and I know this
[02:01:26.260 --> 02:01:29.140]  has been a couple of years for you, John, but at some point
[02:01:29.140 --> 02:01:32.020]  you look down and you realize, holy shit, that's like a person
[02:01:32.020 --> 02:01:34.660]  now. You know, that's not just a little lump. That's not just
[02:01:34.660 --> 02:01:38.500]  a toddler. That's like a full-on person. And for me and
[02:01:38.500 --> 02:01:41.300]  Declan, my son, it was about four years old that I looked at
[02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:45.060]  him and realized, whoa, whoa, he's a real life person now.
[02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:48.260]  And so, you know, as first-time parents and we had a lot of
[02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:50.660]  trouble getting pregnant, so we, of course, you know,
[02:01:50.660 --> 02:01:53.620]  overshared as all first-time parents do regardless. We
[02:01:53.620 --> 02:01:56.500]  overshared pictures of Declan and then later Michaela, my
[02:01:56.500 --> 02:01:58.900]  daughter, when she was born. But it occurred to me when he
[02:01:58.900 --> 02:02:02.100]  was about four that, you know, he doesn't understand consent
[02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:04.420]  and he doesn't understand, you know, if I ask him, hey, can I
[02:02:04.420 --> 02:02:05.940]  put this on the internet? He's going to be like, yeah, sure,
[02:02:05.940 --> 02:02:09.700]  Dad, whatever. But what if in five years and 10 years and 15
[02:02:09.700 --> 02:02:13.060]  years or something like that, what if, you know, some friend
[02:02:13.060 --> 02:02:17.700]  of his or foe even goes looking for, you know, dirt on Declan
[02:02:17.700 --> 02:02:20.740]  and find some like super compromising photo that I've
[02:02:20.740 --> 02:02:22.900]  taken or maybe a photo that I didn't think was compromising,
[02:02:22.900 --> 02:02:26.180]  but he somehow finds to be compromising or, you know,
[02:02:26.180 --> 02:02:28.900]  times change and maybe something that we think is okay
[02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:31.940]  now, we may not think is okay in a year or 10 years or whatnot.
[02:02:31.940 --> 02:02:37.300]  And so for me, what I wanted to do was to put an emoji over my
[02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:40.260]  kids' faces so I could share a picture of maybe me or maybe
[02:02:40.260 --> 02:02:44.660]  Aaron and me and the kids. And you can do this using Instagram
[02:02:44.660 --> 02:02:46.820]  stories, but it's kind of a real pain in the ass.
[02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:48.820]  And it only goes to Instagram stories.
[02:02:48.820 --> 02:02:51.300]  And it's, yeah, it only goes to Instagram stories, or I guess
[02:02:51.300 --> 02:02:53.540]  you can save it to your camera roll, but you know, it's just,
[02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:54.420]  it's, it's a nightmare.
[02:02:54.980 --> 02:02:59.780]  And using Instagram, I, again, I get it that Instagram has the
[02:02:59.780 --> 02:03:02.820]  feature, but I don't think you need to even belabor the point.
[02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:05.940]  Using Instagram as an image editor for something other than
[02:03:05.940 --> 02:03:07.780]  posting to Instagram is ridiculous.
[02:03:07.780 --> 02:03:09.140]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:03:09.140 --> 02:03:12.500]  And so I wanted a way to do this quickly and easily.
[02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:16.340]  And it occurred to me, I had one of those just epiphany moments
[02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:17.780]  where I thought, well, wait a second.
[02:03:18.340 --> 02:03:22.660]  Like a couple of years ago at WWDC, I swear I sat through a
[02:03:22.660 --> 02:03:26.980]  vision related presentation where they talked about face
[02:03:26.980 --> 02:03:27.780]  detection.
[02:03:27.780 --> 02:03:30.180]  There's gotta be something I can do with this.
[02:03:30.180 --> 02:03:33.300]  And so, you know, long story shorter, what, what masquerade
[02:03:33.300 --> 02:03:35.700]  will do is when you load an image into masquerade, it will
[02:03:35.700 --> 02:03:38.580]  automatically use, you know, Apple's machine learning models
[02:03:38.580 --> 02:03:41.620]  to detect where faces are within the image.
[02:03:41.620 --> 02:03:45.140]  And we'll just slap an emoji over any face that it finds.
[02:03:45.140 --> 02:03:47.620]  And then if it's maybe a grownup or someone you don't want
[02:03:47.620 --> 02:03:50.740]  to hide their face, it makes it, you know, masquerade makes
[02:03:50.740 --> 02:03:53.300]  it super easy to just remove what you don't want or add more
[02:03:53.300 --> 02:03:54.260]  if you need to.
[02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:56.980]  But the idea is if I was to take a picture of my family of
[02:03:56.980 --> 02:03:59.460]  four, you know, it will, masquerade will load it up.
[02:03:59.460 --> 02:04:01.940]  It'll put the four emoji on, and then I will just remove the
[02:04:01.940 --> 02:04:03.300]  one from me, the one from Aaron.
[02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:06.020]  And then I can send it off to Instagram or Twitter, wherever
[02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:06.740]  lickety split.
[02:04:06.740 --> 02:04:09.780]  And so I am of the mind, I guess, you know, kind of the
[02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:12.100]  Unix mindset of, you know, do one thing, do it well and do
[02:04:12.100 --> 02:04:12.580]  it fast.
[02:04:12.580 --> 02:04:14.660]  And that's, that's what masquerade is designed to do.
[02:04:14.660 --> 02:04:16.740]  It's, you know, it's funny too.
[02:04:16.740 --> 02:04:19.140]  I just, I will belabor the point of Instagram.
[02:04:19.140 --> 02:04:21.540]  The other thing too is fundamentally, whatever you want
[02:04:21.540 --> 02:04:24.500]  to use masquerade for, it's, it almost certainly revolves
[02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:26.740]  around privacy to some degree.
[02:04:26.740 --> 02:04:29.540]  I mean, yeah, I, I guess the only thing you could use it for
[02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:32.900]  and people probably are, is it might be used for comedic
[02:04:32.900 --> 02:04:36.340]  purposes that have nothing to do with privacy to put a funny
[02:04:36.340 --> 02:04:39.380]  emoji over somebody's face or put the emoji over, you know,
[02:04:39.380 --> 02:04:41.860]  anywhere else, you know, you can add the emoji to make it
[02:04:41.860 --> 02:04:44.180]  look like a fart is, you know, the poof emoji to make it look
[02:04:44.180 --> 02:04:45.460]  like a fart is coming out.
[02:04:45.460 --> 02:04:47.860]  It's probably the number one thing people are using the app
[02:04:47.860 --> 02:04:48.420]  for.
[02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:48.660]  Yeah.
[02:04:48.660 --> 02:04:52.660]  I saw a lot of, uh, pig noses on dog snouts, which I found
[02:04:52.660 --> 02:04:53.780]  quite delightful actually.
[02:04:53.780 --> 02:04:54.260]  Yeah.
[02:04:54.260 --> 02:04:57.540]  But all right, comedy aside, it's about privacy.
[02:04:57.540 --> 02:05:00.260]  And once you're talking about privacy, the idea of using
[02:05:00.260 --> 02:05:03.620]  Instagram's tools because they're free is ridiculous,
[02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:03.940]  right?
[02:05:03.940 --> 02:05:07.540]  Like, you know, no matter what you think about Instagram,
[02:05:07.540 --> 02:05:09.620]  privacy is, does not come to mind.
[02:05:09.620 --> 02:05:11.060]  So it's, it's really clever.
[02:05:11.060 --> 02:05:13.780]  And you, you, I, I'm a little bit behind on ATP.
[02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:15.700]  I didn't listen to the entirety of the most recent show.
[02:05:15.700 --> 02:05:17.460]  I don't know if you talked about masquerade some more, but
[02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:20.660]  at least a week ago, you guys, you did some follow up and
[02:05:20.660 --> 02:05:23.620]  you heard from listeners of the show and other people who
[02:05:23.620 --> 02:05:27.060]  became aware of masquerade already, who had use cases you
[02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:28.900]  had never, you didn't even think of.
[02:05:28.900 --> 02:05:31.460]  I thought the one, the one to me, I remember listening.
[02:05:31.460 --> 02:05:33.380]  It's one of those things where I actually could tell you
[02:05:33.380 --> 02:05:34.420]  exactly where I was.
[02:05:34.420 --> 02:05:37.620]  I was running errands in Philadelphia and I have a weird
[02:05:37.620 --> 02:05:38.340]  memory like this.
[02:05:38.340 --> 02:05:40.100]  I remember where I was when you said it.
[02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:45.540]  I was at a Broad and Walnut Street in Philadelphia on the,
[02:05:45.540 --> 02:05:47.620]  on the East side of the street.
[02:05:47.620 --> 02:05:49.940]  And you said you were talking about like grade school
[02:05:49.940 --> 02:05:53.140]  teachers taking pictures of their classroom.
[02:05:53.140 --> 02:05:53.460]  Yep.
[02:05:53.460 --> 02:05:55.060]  And I was like, Oh, bingo.
[02:05:55.060 --> 02:05:59.140]  And because the thing is the, the, the machine learning part
[02:05:59.140 --> 02:06:02.580]  of it is super fast and accurate, right?
[02:06:02.580 --> 02:06:05.540]  So teacher wants to take a picture for whatever reason,
[02:06:05.540 --> 02:06:06.500]  field trip, right?
[02:06:06.500 --> 02:06:09.460]  It's a field trip and the teacher wants to share a picture
[02:06:09.460 --> 02:06:11.140]  of the class on a trip.
[02:06:11.140 --> 02:06:15.380]  And, you know, again, my kid is a senior in high school now.
[02:06:15.380 --> 02:06:18.660]  I'm past this, but apparently it's now a thing where like,
[02:06:18.660 --> 02:06:20.660]  you know, you have like a second or a third grader and
[02:06:20.660 --> 02:06:23.140]  there's like a social media, what would you call it?
[02:06:23.140 --> 02:06:25.460]  Release, release, release form.
[02:06:26.180 --> 02:06:27.380]  You don't know if you have it or whatever.
[02:06:27.380 --> 02:06:28.420]  Who wants to deal with it?
[02:06:28.420 --> 02:06:31.940]  Maybe, you know, 15 out of 25 kids in your class have them
[02:06:31.940 --> 02:06:32.740]  and 10 don't.
[02:06:32.740 --> 02:06:34.500]  And you don't know who they are, whatever.
[02:06:34.500 --> 02:06:36.900]  And even if you just were like, ah, I just want to put the
[02:06:36.900 --> 02:06:38.180]  emoji over every kid's face.
[02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:40.260]  Well, if you use like a traditional tool and you've got
[02:06:40.260 --> 02:06:43.380]  like a snapshot of like 18 kids on a field trip, it's like,
[02:06:43.380 --> 02:06:44.660]  here's one, here's two.
[02:06:45.380 --> 02:06:46.500]  You use masquerade.
[02:06:46.500 --> 02:06:46.900]  Seriously.
[02:06:46.900 --> 02:06:48.420]  I'm not, I'm not just saying this cause you're a guest.
[02:06:48.420 --> 02:06:51.140]  You use it, you open up that image and boom, you get a little
[02:06:51.140 --> 02:06:53.940]  haptic feedback, which I love, which is one of my favorite
[02:06:53.940 --> 02:06:54.900]  little features.
[02:06:54.900 --> 02:06:56.660]  Get a little, little, I'm not imagining that.
[02:06:56.660 --> 02:06:56.900]  Right.
[02:06:56.900 --> 02:06:58.820]  There's a little haptic feedback when you,
[02:06:58.820 --> 02:07:00.180]  I don't know if it does on load.
[02:07:00.180 --> 02:07:02.340]  I don't think it does on load, but as soon as you like go to
[02:07:02.340 --> 02:07:04.100]  manipulate anything, it absolutely will.
[02:07:04.100 --> 02:07:04.580]  Yeah.
[02:07:04.580 --> 02:07:08.180]  And, and boom, it, it just finds all the faces, puts an emoji
[02:07:08.180 --> 02:07:09.540]  on them and it's done.
[02:07:09.540 --> 02:07:09.780]  Right.
[02:07:09.780 --> 02:07:12.180]  Like, so instead of sitting there and like, oh, well, if I
[02:07:12.180 --> 02:07:14.980]  spend like three minutes, I can put like, I can cover up the
[02:07:14.980 --> 02:07:17.300]  face of all these kids, dot, dot, dot.
[02:07:17.300 --> 02:07:18.260]  You just opened it up.
[02:07:18.260 --> 02:07:18.900]  Boom.
[02:07:18.900 --> 02:07:20.020]  All the faces are covered.
[02:07:20.020 --> 02:07:21.140]  You can pick the emoji.
[02:07:21.140 --> 02:07:21.700]  Really clever.
[02:07:21.700 --> 02:07:25.940]  And like any good computer thing, computers, especially,
[02:07:25.940 --> 02:07:30.580]  it's always the unintended use cases that become the reason
[02:07:30.580 --> 02:07:31.860]  it becomes successful.
[02:07:31.860 --> 02:07:32.100]  Right.
[02:07:32.100 --> 02:07:32.580]  Yeah.
[02:07:32.580 --> 02:07:35.460]  You know, it's like, so you're thinking, I'm a, I'm a dad.
[02:07:35.460 --> 02:07:36.660]  I've got young kids.
[02:07:36.660 --> 02:07:39.300]  I'd like to share these pictures, but you know, you said
[02:07:39.300 --> 02:07:41.540]  it well, you know, that you you'd like to respect their
[02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:43.620]  future wishes and you don't know what they are.
[02:07:43.620 --> 02:07:44.740]  He built it for that.
[02:07:44.740 --> 02:07:47.860]  But the, the school teacher scenario, that's fascinating.
[02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:49.620]  You had a couple other examples too.
[02:07:49.620 --> 02:07:51.620]  I've heard, I've heard a bunch of the most popular one.
[02:07:51.620 --> 02:07:53.540]  I think I've heard is foster parents.
[02:07:53.540 --> 02:07:57.940]  And so my very limited understanding of foster parenting
[02:07:57.940 --> 02:08:02.180]  is that in most places it is illegal, if not certainly
[02:08:02.180 --> 02:08:05.620]  frowned upon, but generally illegal to post an image of a
[02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:09.540]  foster child's face and, and on social media, on social
[02:08:09.540 --> 02:08:09.860]  media.
[02:08:09.860 --> 02:08:10.100]  Right.
[02:08:10.100 --> 02:08:13.380]  And so, so you are legally compelled as a foster parent
[02:08:13.380 --> 02:08:14.900]  who's doing, you know, such an incredible thing.
[02:08:14.900 --> 02:08:18.180]  And I've got to imagine and forgive me if my language is
[02:08:18.180 --> 02:08:20.580]  wrong here, but these kids must feel like part of your
[02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:20.820]  family.
[02:08:20.820 --> 02:08:23.940]  And I guess they are part of your family, if not forever,
[02:08:23.940 --> 02:08:25.780]  but certainly for the time that they're with you.
[02:08:25.780 --> 02:08:29.140]  And so, so yeah, you, you want to share your family with
[02:08:29.140 --> 02:08:31.460]  your friends and other family, you know, you're, you want
[02:08:31.460 --> 02:08:33.700]  to share your immediate family with your extended family
[02:08:33.700 --> 02:08:37.620]  and you're legally compelled not to put their faces on
[02:08:37.620 --> 02:08:39.140]  Facebook or Instagram or what have you.
[02:08:39.140 --> 02:08:41.700]  And so a lot of foster parents reached out and said, Oh my
[02:08:41.700 --> 02:08:43.460]  God, I've been waiting for this my entire life.
[02:08:43.460 --> 02:08:46.260]  Like I had, I had no idea that we could make this so easy.
[02:08:46.260 --> 02:08:47.940]  And that was extremely rewarding.
[02:08:47.940 --> 02:08:51.780]  I had a person reach out who I don't believe they were a
[02:08:51.780 --> 02:08:54.100]  photographer, but I believe associated with photographers,
[02:08:54.100 --> 02:08:56.420]  they were in some sort of news organization that was covering
[02:08:56.420 --> 02:08:57.540]  what's going on in Ukraine.
[02:08:57.540 --> 02:09:00.020]  And they said, you know, this would be extremely useful for
[02:09:00.020 --> 02:09:02.820]  us for covering what's going on with war efforts, what's
[02:09:02.820 --> 02:09:04.660]  going on with protests.
[02:09:04.660 --> 02:09:07.060]  And, you know, because obviously, especially if you're
[02:09:07.060 --> 02:09:10.100]  covering protests in Russia where, you know, the people who
[02:09:10.100 --> 02:09:13.540]  are protesting or taking considerable personal risks by
[02:09:13.540 --> 02:09:16.340]  expressing their opinions to say the least, right.
[02:09:16.340 --> 02:09:18.660]  Yeah, much more so than we've ever had to deal with here,
[02:09:18.660 --> 02:09:20.820]  even during questionable administrations.
[02:09:20.820 --> 02:09:25.540]  And so it makes a lot of sense to, to obscure their faces.
[02:09:25.540 --> 02:09:28.820]  And similarly, like Ukrainian soldiers, if you will, or
[02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:29.940]  whatever the case may be.
[02:09:29.940 --> 02:09:31.540]  And then there are other silly ones though.
[02:09:31.540 --> 02:09:35.140]  And I know you and I agree very strongly that, that Disney
[02:09:35.140 --> 02:09:36.740]  world is a wonderful place to vacation.
[02:09:36.740 --> 02:09:40.100]  And so somebody sent me a photo of both of them sitting, I
[02:09:40.100 --> 02:09:41.700]  think it was in front of the people mover, which is my
[02:09:41.700 --> 02:09:43.060]  personal favorite ride at Disney.
[02:09:43.060 --> 02:09:46.420]  They sent a photo of their family, but all the bystanders
[02:09:46.420 --> 02:09:49.700]  were, were covered with emoji, which I thought was very cool.
[02:09:49.700 --> 02:09:52.100]  But my favorite of these with regard to theme parks was
[02:09:52.100 --> 02:09:55.540]  somebody who took the on-ride photo from splash mountain and
[02:09:55.540 --> 02:09:57.780]  then scared all the other faces.
[02:09:57.780 --> 02:10:00.420]  I think with like the screaming, like Van Gogh or no,
[02:10:00.420 --> 02:10:01.380]  I forget who it is.
[02:10:01.380 --> 02:10:02.820]  The starry night, screaming guy.
[02:10:02.820 --> 02:10:05.940]  And I think there was a bunch of screaming people and then
[02:10:05.940 --> 02:10:07.220]  just their family was left.
[02:10:07.220 --> 02:10:08.180]  So you could see them.
[02:10:08.180 --> 02:10:09.780]  And I really loved that.
[02:10:09.780 --> 02:10:12.820]  Those are my, I think my favorites, the most
[02:10:12.820 --> 02:10:16.740]  unexpected though, was I've had a handful of boudoir
[02:10:17.460 --> 02:10:20.500]  photographers reach out and say, you know, sometimes some
[02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:23.940]  of our pictures are not safe for work and we might need to,
[02:10:23.940 --> 02:10:28.580]  let's say use the eggplant or peach emojis strategically,
[02:10:28.580 --> 02:10:30.740]  or perhaps, you know, they people, maybe they just want
[02:10:30.740 --> 02:10:32.980]  their heads covered and it's not as, not quite as risque as
[02:10:32.980 --> 02:10:33.620]  I'm painting it.
[02:10:33.620 --> 02:10:35.940]  But that was, that was something I didn't quite expect
[02:10:35.940 --> 02:10:36.420]  to read.
[02:10:36.420 --> 02:10:39.300]  And it got, there were even some more risque versions than
[02:10:39.300 --> 02:10:41.540]  that, that I won't necessarily share right now, but those
[02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:43.380]  were, those were quite eyeopening.
[02:10:43.380 --> 02:10:45.780]  And certainly I'm not complaining, but it's certainly not
[02:10:45.780 --> 02:10:48.500]  the use case I had set out for when I wrote the app.
[02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:51.140]  But that's really a sign of strength of a good idea that
[02:10:51.140 --> 02:10:53.300]  it's used in ways you didn't expect.
[02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:55.620]  My favorite story about that is BB Edit.
[02:10:56.180 --> 02:11:00.340]  BB Edit started in 1991, I think was the first version.
[02:11:00.340 --> 02:11:05.540]  And it's sort of infamous where version 1.0 was only like,
[02:11:05.540 --> 02:11:07.380]  I think the only people who used it worked at Think
[02:11:07.380 --> 02:11:09.620]  Technologies with Rich Siegel.
[02:11:09.620 --> 02:11:13.540]  And the first version he released publicly was like 2.0.
[02:11:13.540 --> 02:11:15.300]  But anytime there's somebody who's like, I've been using
[02:11:15.300 --> 02:11:16.260]  it since 1.0.
[02:11:16.260 --> 02:11:18.500]  And Rich can say like, well, you didn't work with me.
[02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:20.980]  So no, but I know what you mean.
[02:11:20.980 --> 02:11:22.980]  And I appreciate your long-term use of the product.
[02:11:23.620 --> 02:11:27.300]  You know, it's 92, 93, and it was a smash hit in the
[02:11:27.300 --> 02:11:28.340]  shareware world.
[02:11:28.340 --> 02:11:30.500]  And then, you know, all of a sudden the World Wide Web
[02:11:30.500 --> 02:11:32.420]  becomes a thing, circa like 1994.
[02:11:32.420 --> 02:11:34.820]  And they start getting all this email and they had a
[02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:37.060]  plugin API and somebody, I think his name was Craig
[02:11:37.060 --> 02:11:41.060]  somebody, but made like a really, at the time, very good
[02:11:41.060 --> 02:11:44.020]  plugin for HTML, where you got like this palette full of
[02:11:44.020 --> 02:11:45.380]  all the most popular tags.
[02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:48.100]  And then you could just select text, hit a button and
[02:11:48.100 --> 02:11:49.540]  surround the text with the tags.
[02:11:49.540 --> 02:11:51.940]  Or if it was like the image tag, it would prompt for the
[02:11:51.940 --> 02:11:53.220]  image URL.
[02:11:53.220 --> 02:11:55.620]  You know, it just made it just a convenience thing for
[02:11:55.620 --> 02:11:56.820]  writing HTML.
[02:11:56.820 --> 02:11:59.220]  And that they got all these emails from people like, oh
[02:11:59.220 --> 02:12:01.460]  my God, BB Edit is the greatest thing ever for HTML.
[02:12:01.460 --> 02:12:03.700]  And like the first answers were like, hey, that's great
[02:12:03.700 --> 02:12:04.020]  to hear.
[02:12:04.020 --> 02:12:07.940]  What's HTML?
[02:12:07.940 --> 02:12:08.500]  Tell me more.
[02:12:08.500 --> 02:12:10.500]  And, you know, it was a very quick process.
[02:12:10.500 --> 02:12:12.180]  I mean, the web exploded in popularity.
[02:12:12.180 --> 02:12:15.780]  And, you know, Rich and Patrick Woolsey, his longtime
[02:12:15.780 --> 02:12:18.020]  colleague, you know, and co-founder, you know, it quickly
[02:12:18.020 --> 02:12:20.740]  went from what's HTML to, oh, okay, I get it.
[02:12:20.740 --> 02:12:23.700]  And now I can see why BB Edit's good for it, but it wasn't
[02:12:23.700 --> 02:12:25.780]  designed for it at all.
[02:12:25.780 --> 02:12:28.740]  And, you know, it became, for a long time, it was known,
[02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:32.260]  BB Edit was best known as an HTML editor and hadn't really
[02:12:32.260 --> 02:12:35.300]  changed except having a plugin for it.
[02:12:35.300 --> 02:12:36.660]  Same thing with Masquerade, right?
[02:12:36.660 --> 02:12:39.940]  Like, you did not think that it was going to be used to
[02:12:39.940 --> 02:12:42.420]  cover up adult photography, you know?
[02:12:42.420 --> 02:12:43.060]  Certainly not.
[02:12:43.060 --> 02:12:44.580]  But I'll just say this for anybody.
[02:12:44.580 --> 02:12:48.260]  So automatically it uses machine learning to identify
[02:12:48.260 --> 02:12:51.940]  faces and will put the emoji of your choice over all the
[02:12:51.940 --> 02:12:54.980]  faces, and then you can pinch to zoom them to make them
[02:12:54.980 --> 02:12:57.300]  bigger or smaller or drag them around.
[02:12:57.300 --> 02:13:01.220]  But it also, it will let you add emoji to an image and
[02:13:01.220 --> 02:13:03.140]  cover up anything you want, you know?
[02:13:03.140 --> 02:13:06.660]  You cover up a brand name of a can of soda, whatever.
[02:13:06.660 --> 02:13:09.140]  If you just want to obscure something in a photo with an
[02:13:09.140 --> 02:13:12.180]  emoji to cover it up, it's super easy to do.
[02:13:12.180 --> 02:13:13.460]  It's not just for faces.
[02:13:14.100 --> 02:13:14.580]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:13:14.580 --> 02:13:17.220]  And I actually have been kicking around the idea of
[02:13:17.220 --> 02:13:21.060]  having some sort of switch where if you find yourself not
[02:13:21.060 --> 02:13:23.540]  particularly interested in covering faces that I won't
[02:13:23.540 --> 02:13:25.860]  even bother trying, you know, and maybe there would be a
[02:13:25.860 --> 02:13:28.660]  button you could hit after the fact, you know, if you would
[02:13:28.660 --> 02:13:29.620]  like to cover faces.
[02:13:29.620 --> 02:13:31.380]  Just a quick point of clarification, though.
[02:13:31.380 --> 02:13:34.180]  The free version, you can only use the smiley face emoji,
[02:13:34.180 --> 02:13:36.020]  like the very bog standard smiley face.
[02:13:36.020 --> 02:13:38.580]  It's a one-time $3 an app purchase to get basically all
[02:13:38.580 --> 02:13:39.380]  the other emoji.
[02:13:39.380 --> 02:13:40.980]  And then, and that's that.
[02:13:40.980 --> 02:13:43.540]  I don't currently have any intentions of adding any other
[02:13:43.540 --> 02:13:44.420]  sort of in-app purchase.
[02:13:44.420 --> 02:13:46.100]  You never, you know, never say never, but that's not
[02:13:46.100 --> 02:13:47.220]  currently my intention.
[02:13:47.220 --> 02:13:50.260]  But no, it's, I think it's a pretty, if I'm allowed to say,
[02:13:50.260 --> 02:13:51.220]  I think it's pretty good app.
[02:13:51.220 --> 02:13:52.340]  I think it's pretty well done.
[02:13:52.340 --> 02:13:54.260]  And this is my third independent app that I've released
[02:13:54.260 --> 02:13:54.980]  to the app store.
[02:13:54.980 --> 02:13:57.380]  And I think, far and away, this is the best of the three.
[02:13:57.380 --> 02:13:59.700]  And I think it does the job and it does it well.
[02:13:59.700 --> 02:14:03.540]  And like I said, I'm not terribly interested for me in
[02:14:03.540 --> 02:14:05.780]  writing an app that's the sort of thing where you stay in it
[02:14:05.780 --> 02:14:06.340]  for hours.
[02:14:06.340 --> 02:14:09.140]  Like, that's just not where my skill set is.
[02:14:09.140 --> 02:14:12.340]  I'm much more skillful at writing something that you get
[02:14:12.340 --> 02:14:14.740]  in, you get out, and you've accomplished what you want to
[02:14:14.740 --> 02:14:15.220]  accomplish.
[02:14:15.220 --> 02:14:17.780]  And that's very much what Masquerade is designed to be.
[02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:21.140]  And I really think that, even if you're not a parent, even
[02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:22.900]  if you're not going to theme parks, even if you're not
[02:14:22.900 --> 02:14:27.060]  protesting, I really think for almost anyone, there's got to
[02:14:27.060 --> 02:14:29.300]  be an occasion where, like you said, John, you would want to
[02:14:29.300 --> 02:14:32.260]  obscure or otherwise hide a part of an image.
[02:14:32.260 --> 02:14:35.860]  And for someone who fancies himself an emoji aficionado,
[02:14:35.860 --> 02:14:38.980]  I think that using an emoji or two or 10 or whatever is a
[02:14:38.980 --> 02:14:40.020]  fun way to do it.
[02:14:40.020 --> 02:14:44.980]  Even leaving aside comedy as the point, just using emoji to
[02:14:44.980 --> 02:14:47.620]  obscure something, I think is a fun approach.
[02:14:47.620 --> 02:14:50.820]  And I find that much more entertaining and interesting
[02:14:50.820 --> 02:14:52.900]  than, say, a blur or something like that.
[02:14:52.900 --> 02:14:56.980]  Yeah, I did not mean to imply that the free version includes
[02:14:56.980 --> 02:14:57.540]  all the emoji.
[02:14:57.540 --> 02:14:59.860]  But come on, three bucks in my audience.
[02:14:59.860 --> 02:15:01.060]  Come on, everybody out there.
[02:15:01.060 --> 02:15:02.660]  Get this app, pay for it.
[02:15:02.660 --> 02:15:04.500]  Three bucks one time, not three bucks a month.
[02:15:04.500 --> 02:15:05.060]  Three bucks?
[02:15:05.060 --> 02:15:06.180]  It's too cheap.
[02:15:06.180 --> 02:15:06.660]  Too cheap.
[02:15:07.860 --> 02:15:09.540]  I can make it more if you want, John.
[02:15:09.540 --> 02:15:10.660]  I'll crank it up to five or 10.
[02:15:10.660 --> 02:15:15.380]  But I also think it's always, and you and I, both you, you're
[02:15:15.380 --> 02:15:17.380]  actually making independent apps, you and I are friends
[02:15:17.380 --> 02:15:18.180]  with a bunch of people.
[02:15:18.180 --> 02:15:22.980]  It's always sort of a tricky thing, like where do you draw
[02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:25.460]  the line on what's included for free and what do you get
[02:15:25.460 --> 02:15:26.420]  people to pay for?
[02:15:26.420 --> 02:15:30.420]  Our mutual friend Daniel Jalkit just issued an update to
[02:15:30.420 --> 02:15:34.660]  his Fast Scripts utility for the Mac, which adds regular
[02:15:34.660 --> 02:15:37.380]  expression support to AppleScript, which it sounds like
[02:15:37.380 --> 02:15:39.060]  something that was made just for me.
[02:15:39.060 --> 02:15:42.500]  AppleScript, Mac, and regular expressions?
[02:15:42.500 --> 02:15:44.420]  Yeah, that's the John Gruber feature.
[02:15:44.420 --> 02:15:45.700]  But I didn't even ask him for it.
[02:15:45.700 --> 02:15:46.900]  But I did beta test it.
[02:15:46.900 --> 02:15:48.580]  But even he was torn.
[02:15:48.580 --> 02:15:51.220]  He's like, ah, should it be for the pay version or free?
[02:15:51.220 --> 02:15:55.700]  And I was like, I sort of, I would love you to make as much
[02:15:55.700 --> 02:15:57.700]  money as possible with Fast Scripts, but I sort of think
[02:15:57.700 --> 02:15:58.500]  it should be free.
[02:15:58.500 --> 02:15:59.700]  And he's like, yeah, it should.
[02:15:59.700 --> 02:16:01.940]  Because otherwise, people who want something free from
[02:16:01.940 --> 02:16:04.740]  AppleScript are going to do the whole, well, I could just
[02:16:04.740 --> 02:16:07.860]  use do shell script and write a temp file and call out to
[02:16:07.860 --> 02:16:10.500]  set or Perl or grep or whatever the hell you're using on
[02:16:10.500 --> 02:16:11.300]  the command line.
[02:16:11.300 --> 02:16:14.340]  And you've got this, whatever you think of AppleScript, using
[02:16:14.340 --> 02:16:18.900]  Fast Scripts to just say, search this for that where that
[02:16:18.900 --> 02:16:23.300]  is the pattern as opposed to quoted form of this to do shell
[02:16:23.300 --> 02:16:24.420]  script and writing a temp.
[02:16:24.420 --> 02:16:25.620]  It's a mess.
[02:16:25.620 --> 02:16:29.060]  But what the hoops people will go through to do it for free,
[02:16:29.860 --> 02:16:31.380]  don't never underestimate.
[02:16:31.380 --> 02:16:32.740]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:16:32.740 --> 02:16:36.980]  But I think that in this case, it is, to me, brilliant.
[02:16:36.980 --> 02:16:41.540]  Because you can do all the features with the one default
[02:16:41.540 --> 02:16:45.380]  emoji, and that one default emoji is the emoji, right?
[02:16:45.380 --> 02:16:48.340]  Like if you were going to reduce the entire emoji set to
[02:16:48.340 --> 02:16:50.500]  one, it would be the default smiley face, right?
[02:16:50.500 --> 02:16:53.060]  And you could see how it works, see how it scales, see how
[02:16:53.060 --> 02:16:55.860]  it identifies faces, see how it lets you move it wherever
[02:16:55.860 --> 02:16:56.360]  you want.
[02:16:56.900 --> 02:17:01.300]  And the, oh, but I would love to use the eggplant or
[02:17:01.300 --> 02:17:04.340]  whatever, the peach, you know, whatever else, or, you know,
[02:17:04.340 --> 02:17:09.940]  any of the other 100 faces and various skin tones and the
[02:17:09.940 --> 02:17:11.540]  gender identities and all.
[02:17:11.540 --> 02:17:14.420]  I mean, you know, you probably even know the answer to this.
[02:17:14.420 --> 02:17:15.540]  How many emoji are there?
[02:17:15.540 --> 02:17:18.980]  I mean, so if you include skin tones, which I don't have
[02:17:18.980 --> 02:17:21.700]  masquerade right now, because it's a really tricky UI problem
[02:17:21.700 --> 02:17:22.100]  to solve.
[02:17:22.100 --> 02:17:24.180]  Like, obviously, the right way to do it is to do what Apple
[02:17:24.180 --> 02:17:26.180]  has done, but that gets really complicated really quickly.
[02:17:26.180 --> 02:17:26.740]  Tap and hold.
[02:17:26.740 --> 02:17:28.260]  So I think, yeah, exactly.
[02:17:28.260 --> 02:17:31.460]  But I'm certainly, it's on the to-do list for sure, but I
[02:17:31.460 --> 02:17:33.460]  don't want to oversell and bait and switch or anything.
[02:17:33.460 --> 02:17:36.660]  But to answer your question, I believe the full list of
[02:17:36.660 --> 02:17:38.500]  Unicode emoji off the top of my head, I think it's like
[02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:41.700]  6,000 where every, you know, every different skin tone is
[02:17:41.700 --> 02:17:42.980]  a different listing and so on.
[02:17:42.980 --> 02:17:45.380]  So people have choices.
[02:17:46.180 --> 02:17:46.340]  Yeah.
[02:17:46.340 --> 02:17:49.220]  And I think I whittle, even taking away skin tones, I think
[02:17:49.220 --> 02:17:52.100]  I would whittle it down to like 2,500, I believe.
[02:17:52.100 --> 02:17:54.180]  I might have that wrong, but it's something like that.
[02:17:54.180 --> 02:17:56.820]  Yeah, but it's, you know, people can imagine what it would
[02:17:56.820 --> 02:17:59.540]  be like to be able to use whichever their favorite emoji
[02:17:59.540 --> 02:18:00.020]  are.
[02:18:00.020 --> 02:18:01.060]  And it's three bucks.
[02:18:01.060 --> 02:18:02.180]  And again, brilliant.
[02:18:02.180 --> 02:18:04.500]  And again, I think the price should be higher, to be honest.
[02:18:05.060 --> 02:18:05.460]  I do.
[02:18:05.460 --> 02:18:05.780]  I do.
[02:18:05.780 --> 02:18:07.620]  I think three bucks is too little, but it's a bargain.
[02:18:07.620 --> 02:18:09.940]  So anybody who's out there thinking, well, Gruber's nuts.
[02:18:09.940 --> 02:18:13.620]  He spends money like a drunken sailor, you know, to go buy
[02:18:13.620 --> 02:18:16.980]  it for three bucks before I can talk Casey into upping the
[02:18:16.980 --> 02:18:17.220]  price.
[02:18:17.220 --> 02:18:21.140]  But I love too that it's not like, oh, well, you buy the
[02:18:21.140 --> 02:18:26.420]  object pack for a dollar, buy the people pack for two dollars,
[02:18:26.420 --> 02:18:29.940]  buy the hand gestures for a dollar.
[02:18:29.940 --> 02:18:32.580]  No, three bucks, all emoji.
[02:18:32.580 --> 02:18:33.140]  That's it.
[02:18:33.140 --> 02:18:33.780]  Done.
[02:18:33.780 --> 02:18:35.940]  Yeah, I guess, you know, that's, there's two different
[02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:37.540]  obnoxious versions of this, right?
[02:18:37.540 --> 02:18:39.860]  Like, there's one obnoxious version, which is nickel and
[02:18:39.860 --> 02:18:41.460]  diming through all the different emoji.
[02:18:41.460 --> 02:18:44.020]  And then the other obnoxious version is using like the poop
[02:18:44.020 --> 02:18:47.780]  emoji as the one for something like that, something that's
[02:18:47.780 --> 02:18:49.620]  less useful than just a smiley.
[02:18:49.620 --> 02:18:52.900]  And when I was thinking about how to monetize and where to
[02:18:52.900 --> 02:18:56.260]  draw the line, I can't think of a specific example offhand,
[02:18:56.260 --> 02:18:57.620]  but actually, you know, I can.
[02:18:57.620 --> 02:18:59.860]  And now I'm showing my age.
[02:18:59.860 --> 02:19:03.940]  Like, if you remember, and I think Doom came to the Mac,
[02:19:03.940 --> 02:19:07.700]  but for when I was on the PC, you know, Doom was brand new,
[02:19:07.700 --> 02:19:10.100]  Doom, the ID software video game.
[02:19:10.100 --> 02:19:11.940]  And it was shareware and shareware was huge at the time.
[02:19:11.940 --> 02:19:14.020]  And what they did was they gave you the entire first level,
[02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:16.500]  no restrictions whatsoever.
[02:19:16.500 --> 02:19:20.500]  The first stage, if you will, you could play that for free.
[02:19:20.500 --> 02:19:22.100]  But if you wanted to go any further, guess what?
[02:19:22.100 --> 02:19:23.140]  You got to pony up the cash.
[02:19:23.140 --> 02:19:25.300]  And I feel like this is kind of similar to that.
[02:19:25.300 --> 02:19:28.340]  You know, what I'm giving you is fully functional, like you
[02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:30.340]  were saying, and it's not obnoxious.
[02:19:30.340 --> 02:19:33.380]  It's not, you know, it doesn't have a ridiculous Achilles
[02:19:33.380 --> 02:19:36.580]  heel, but if you want to take it anywhere further from,
[02:19:36.580 --> 02:19:40.580]  you know, the very most basic step, then please give me
[02:19:40.580 --> 02:19:43.140]  $3 for now, and maybe John will convince me to make it
[02:19:43.140 --> 02:19:44.340]  five in a few days.
[02:19:44.340 --> 02:19:44.660]  I don't know.
[02:19:44.660 --> 02:19:45.540]  We'll see.
[02:19:45.540 --> 02:19:49.940]  But I feel like that's riding the line in a happy way,
[02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:53.140]  that I'm trying to be useful to those who don't or can't
[02:19:53.140 --> 02:19:56.420]  pay, but also trying to put food on the table for those
[02:19:56.420 --> 02:19:56.920]  who can.
[02:19:57.620 --> 02:20:00.660]  I don't know what the most spiteful default emoji could be.
[02:20:00.660 --> 02:20:04.020]  Maybe it is an eggplant.
[02:20:04.020 --> 02:20:04.580]  I don't know.
[02:20:04.580 --> 02:20:07.220]  No, because that would wreck it for parents, right?
[02:20:07.780 --> 02:20:08.660]  That's too ridiculous.
[02:20:08.660 --> 02:20:11.540]  But it would be like, I don't know, like the, I'm looking
[02:20:11.540 --> 02:20:12.980]  through the drunken guy.
[02:20:12.980 --> 02:20:13.620]  Yeah.
[02:20:13.620 --> 02:20:14.340]  The drunken guy.
[02:20:14.340 --> 02:20:14.740]  What is it?
[02:20:14.740 --> 02:20:16.020]  I forget the actual name for it.
[02:20:16.020 --> 02:20:16.820]  Woozy, I think.
[02:20:16.820 --> 02:20:18.260]  Woozy face, if I'm not mistaken.
[02:20:18.260 --> 02:20:20.340]  Some of them are so weird, though, because they come from
[02:20:20.340 --> 02:20:23.700]  like, you know, the whole thing started in Japan on cell
[02:20:23.700 --> 02:20:26.900]  phones in the 90s, and there's all sorts of cultural reasons
[02:20:26.900 --> 02:20:27.860]  you don't understand.
[02:20:27.860 --> 02:20:30.260]  But like, there's some of the weird ones under symbols.
[02:20:30.260 --> 02:20:33.300]  There's like an arrow pointing to the right, and it actually
[02:20:33.300 --> 02:20:37.860]  says in English letters underneath soon, you know?
[02:20:37.860 --> 02:20:38.420]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:20:39.220 --> 02:20:42.740]  There's one where there's an arrow pointing up and it says
[02:20:42.740 --> 02:20:45.780]  top, something like that would probably be the...
[02:20:45.780 --> 02:20:48.820]  I could use a non-potable water, which is like a little
[02:20:48.820 --> 02:20:51.700]  water spigot you would find outside with a circle with a
[02:20:51.700 --> 02:20:54.180]  line through it or no littering or something, or actually
[02:20:54.180 --> 02:20:56.500]  no, just how about just straight up prohibited or no entry,
[02:20:56.500 --> 02:20:56.660]  you know?
[02:20:56.660 --> 02:21:00.020]  So no entry is a circle with the white line and center.
[02:21:00.020 --> 02:21:01.540]  Prohibited is a circle with the slash.
[02:21:01.540 --> 02:21:02.340]  Maybe that's it.
[02:21:02.340 --> 02:21:03.220]  That'd be pretty obnoxious.
[02:21:03.220 --> 02:21:04.740]  You could have been a lot more spiteful.
[02:21:04.740 --> 02:21:07.860]  It is, in fact, usable for free with a smiley face.
[02:21:07.860 --> 02:21:11.860]  Anyway, masquerade, M-A-S-K-E-R-A-I-D.
[02:21:11.860 --> 02:21:12.580]  You can find it.
[02:21:12.580 --> 02:21:13.460]  That's right.
[02:21:13.460 --> 02:21:16.260]  And on at least one major app store for now.
[02:21:17.300 --> 02:21:18.020]  That's right.
[02:21:18.020 --> 02:21:19.700]  Yeah, no, no, I'm not planning an Android version.
[02:21:19.700 --> 02:21:20.740]  Don't even hint.
[02:21:20.740 --> 02:21:23.540]  Oh, no, I'm talking about the coming glorious future of
[02:21:23.540 --> 02:21:27.860]  multiple app stores in the EU for Apple.
[02:21:27.860 --> 02:21:30.340]  Yeah, I'll be putting it on the Amazon Apple app store or
[02:21:30.340 --> 02:21:31.140]  something like that, right?
[02:21:32.260 --> 02:21:32.740]  All right.
[02:21:32.740 --> 02:21:34.340]  So let me thank our sponsors.
[02:21:34.340 --> 02:21:38.260]  We had Linode, where you can host linode.com slash the talk
[02:21:38.260 --> 02:21:38.420]  show.
[02:21:38.420 --> 02:21:40.340]  You can host your website, anything you want.
[02:21:40.340 --> 02:21:44.100]  Remote, where you can help use them to help pay for your
[02:21:44.100 --> 02:21:48.180]  remote employees all around the world at remote.com slash
[02:21:48.180 --> 02:21:48.820]  the talk show.
[02:21:48.820 --> 02:21:51.540]  And then last, but certainly not least, Memberful, where
[02:21:51.540 --> 02:21:54.340]  you can monetize your passion with membership at
[02:21:54.340 --> 02:21:57.860]  memberful.com slash talk show.
[02:21:57.860 --> 02:22:02.420]  People can listen to Casey on the Accidental Tech Podcast.
[02:22:02.420 --> 02:22:04.260]  That's ATP.fm.
[02:22:04.260 --> 02:22:06.020]  And then you've got your other show.
[02:22:06.020 --> 02:22:09.380]  That's analog with our mutual friend Mike Hurley.
[02:22:09.380 --> 02:22:11.460]  That's at relay.fm such analog.
[02:22:12.420 --> 02:22:14.100]  How does that guy do so many shows?
[02:22:14.100 --> 02:22:15.140]  I don't even get me started.
[02:22:15.140 --> 02:22:15.540]  I don't know.
[02:22:16.100 --> 02:22:16.820]  I don't get it.
[02:22:16.820 --> 02:22:18.420]  I honestly, I don't get it.
[02:22:18.420 --> 02:22:19.860]  I don't think he believes in sleep, John.
[02:22:20.660 --> 02:22:23.460]  I like sleep way too much, so that's not my lifestyle.
[02:22:23.460 --> 02:22:25.300]  But he is very prolific.
[02:22:25.300 --> 02:22:27.300]  Yeah, but somehow he's making all these shows.
[02:22:27.300 --> 02:22:29.540]  And I was talking to Snell the other day about mechanical
[02:22:29.540 --> 02:22:30.740]  keyboards, as we do.
[02:22:30.740 --> 02:22:33.620]  Like, we're always talking about baseball and mechanical.
[02:22:33.620 --> 02:22:36.820]  And he built Snell a custom.
[02:22:36.820 --> 02:22:42.340]  He bought like a Keychron Q1 and took all the switches off
[02:22:42.340 --> 02:22:45.300]  and put these like bespoke switches on.
[02:22:45.940 --> 02:22:47.620]  I mean, and send it to Snell.
[02:22:47.620 --> 02:22:49.460]  How the hell does he find time to do shit like that?
[02:22:49.460 --> 02:22:49.860]  I don't understand.
[02:22:49.860 --> 02:22:50.740]  I have no idea.
[02:22:50.740 --> 02:22:51.220]  I have no idea.
[02:22:51.220 --> 02:22:54.740]  But that was his, like, for fun, like relaxing work, if you will.
[02:22:54.740 --> 02:22:58.020]  You know, he was doing that, I believe, some for upgrade
[02:22:58.020 --> 02:23:00.180]  and then some, I think, for what he calls the Friday
[02:23:00.180 --> 02:23:01.940]  Keyboard Club, which he does on Twitch.
[02:23:01.940 --> 02:23:04.500]  And so, yeah, that's his, like, relaxing thing, is to go
[02:23:04.500 --> 02:23:07.540]  on Twitch in front of a gazillion people and try to both
[02:23:07.540 --> 02:23:10.980]  do manual labor and also communicate with people who are
[02:23:10.980 --> 02:23:12.580]  watching him all simultaneously.
[02:23:12.580 --> 02:23:13.460]  He's an animal.
[02:23:13.460 --> 02:23:14.340]  I don't know how he does it.
[02:23:14.340 --> 02:23:15.140]  I don't know either.
[02:23:15.140 --> 02:23:16.100]  Anyway, thanks for being here.
[02:23:16.100 --> 02:23:18.580]  I'll, you know, make sure it happens again at some point.
[02:23:19.300 --> 02:23:20.020]  Thank you so much, John.
[02:23:20.020 --> 02:23:21.460]  Pleasure's all mine.
