[00:00.000 --> 00:03.120]  just kicked out the cord to my Macbook Pro.
[00:04.960 --> 00:07.000]  And guess what, it's not a problem,
[00:07.000 --> 00:10.520]  because I'm still using a 2014 Macbook Pro with MagSafe.
[00:10.520 --> 00:12.360]  There you go, there you go.
[00:12.360 --> 00:13.480]  You know, I was thinking about this.
[00:13.480 --> 00:14.440]  Brilliant invention.
[00:14.440 --> 00:18.980]  I'm still getting feedback from people
[00:18.980 --> 00:21.640]  about that Brian Chen iPhone.
[00:21.640 --> 00:23.120]  I don't know if you listened to me and Nely
[00:23.120 --> 00:24.800]  on the Vergecast podcast.
[00:24.800 --> 00:25.680]  I did, I did.
[00:25.680 --> 00:28.720]  I mean, I enjoy the two of you always,
[00:28.720 --> 00:30.520]  but I knew you were gonna talk about that article,
[00:30.520 --> 00:33.680]  so I made a special flight to make sure to listen to it.
[00:33.680 --> 00:35.520]  Well, I also think, wasn't that the one too
[00:35.520 --> 00:37.160]  where we sung your praises?
[00:37.160 --> 00:38.240]  It was disgusting.
[00:38.240 --> 00:39.520]  I think you might have said something kind.
[00:39.520 --> 00:40.560]  I do appreciate it.
[00:40.560 --> 00:41.680]  It made me sick.
[00:41.680 --> 00:42.800]  I knew you were gonna listen too.
[00:42.800 --> 00:43.640]  Son of a bitch.
[00:45.640 --> 00:50.640]  But anyway, one aspect of this is like the whole theory
[00:51.920 --> 00:54.840]  that people like me and Nely and other people
[00:54.840 --> 00:57.900]  who write these reviews are cheerleaders
[00:57.900 --> 01:01.000]  telling people to go buy the newest thing,
[01:01.000 --> 01:02.600]  buy the newest thing, buy the newest thing,
[01:02.600 --> 01:03.440]  just isn't true.
[01:03.440 --> 01:06.160]  And the fact that I'm using a 2014 MacBook Pro,
[01:06.160 --> 01:07.760]  it's literally five years old at this point.
[01:07.760 --> 01:11.800]  I believe I even bought it around this time of the year
[01:11.800 --> 01:16.360]  in 2014, so I'm using a five-year-old laptop right now,
[01:16.360 --> 01:18.020]  literally, to record this show.
[01:18.020 --> 01:20.360]  I've been typing almost everything I've written
[01:20.360 --> 01:22.460]  for the last year or so on this machine.
[01:24.020 --> 01:25.320]  I still love it.
[01:25.320 --> 01:28.520]  It is, I need to write like a five-year review
[01:28.520 --> 01:30.080]  of this thing, because I do believe
[01:30.080 --> 01:32.360]  that it is the single greatest computing device
[01:32.360 --> 01:33.540]  I've ever purchased in my life.
[01:33.540 --> 01:34.380]  I love it.
[01:34.380 --> 01:36.560]  Yeah, I had the exact same generation,
[01:36.560 --> 01:39.720]  and I also loved it, and it was absolutely fantastic.
[01:39.720 --> 01:42.600]  And then I dropped it, and now I have one
[01:42.600 --> 01:44.640]  of the new MacBook Pros, and I don't like it nearly as much.
[01:44.640 --> 01:46.000]  I can promise you that.
[01:46.000 --> 01:47.400]  Do you know what it has that's wrong?
[01:47.400 --> 01:48.460]  I don't know if you've seen this.
[01:48.460 --> 01:50.360]  I know Syracuse had it, and other people had it,
[01:50.360 --> 01:52.040]  and it was a known issue that Apple had
[01:52.040 --> 01:53.600]  like a support page up.
[01:53.600 --> 01:58.480]  Around the display, the black bezel around the display,
[01:58.480 --> 02:00.720]  it is, there's some kind of adhesion
[02:00.720 --> 02:03.940]  that keeps the plastic surface to whatever's behind it,
[02:03.940 --> 02:07.240]  and at some point, I mean, at this point,
[02:07.240 --> 02:10.200]  I've had the problem longer than I didn't have it.
[02:10.200 --> 02:12.880]  Three years ago, maybe more.
[02:12.880 --> 02:15.360]  It looks like the screen needs to be cleaned,
[02:15.360 --> 02:17.320]  like it looks like something you could just wipe off.
[02:17.320 --> 02:18.920]  Yeah, I know exactly what that is.
[02:18.920 --> 02:19.760]  Oh, I didn't realize it.
[02:19.760 --> 02:21.640]  Yeah, no, I had that for sure, for sure.
[02:21.640 --> 02:25.720]  And my thing was, unfortunately, I put on,
[02:25.720 --> 02:28.320]  I liked the messenger bag style.
[02:28.320 --> 02:29.320]  I think it's much more convenient
[02:29.320 --> 02:30.800]  for putting stuff in or out,
[02:30.800 --> 02:32.280]  but I like carrying things as a backpack
[02:32.280 --> 02:35.160]  because I destroyed my back carrying around a messenger bag
[02:35.160 --> 02:36.840]  back in business school.
[02:36.840 --> 02:39.520]  So Toomey makes this great bag
[02:39.520 --> 02:41.840]  where you use it like a messenger bag,
[02:41.840 --> 02:43.520]  but it has backpack straps,
[02:43.520 --> 02:45.640]  and also has a little thing to put over your carry-on.
[02:45.640 --> 02:47.440]  It's perfect, it's a brilliant bag.
[02:47.440 --> 02:49.720]  So when you're actually like walking great distances,
[02:49.720 --> 02:50.640]  you can wear a backpack,
[02:50.640 --> 02:52.920]  and then right before you like meet people,
[02:52.920 --> 02:54.720]  you can turn it into a messenger bag
[02:54.720 --> 02:56.840]  and look a little bit cool.
[02:56.840 --> 02:59.120]  Well, no, I don't carry the messenger bag strap,
[02:59.120 --> 03:00.960]  but it does have like briefcase handles,
[03:00.960 --> 03:02.360]  so you can kind of carry it or whatever.
[03:02.360 --> 03:04.520]  But I have no shame, so it's fine.
[03:04.520 --> 03:07.880]  But I put it on,
[03:07.880 --> 03:09.840]  because the problem is the zippers are on the side,
[03:09.840 --> 03:12.560]  and I hadn't zipped up the computer part
[03:12.560 --> 03:13.920]  where you put the computer in.
[03:13.920 --> 03:15.880]  So I throw it over my shoulders,
[03:15.880 --> 03:18.440]  and the computer goes flying out the side,
[03:18.440 --> 03:21.080]  and that was the end of my beloved,
[03:21.080 --> 03:22.960]  I think it was 2015, the last year
[03:22.960 --> 03:24.280]  that they had that model.
[03:25.400 --> 03:26.240]  I think so.
[03:26.240 --> 03:29.640]  They're one of my beloved 2015 13-inch MacBook Pro.
[03:29.640 --> 03:31.320]  And I could even be misremembering,
[03:31.320 --> 03:32.760]  mine might be a 2015.
[03:32.760 --> 03:35.560]  Actually, I guess I can just go to, what, about this Mac?
[03:37.360 --> 03:38.760]  I think it's 2014, you talked about it before.
[03:38.760 --> 03:39.840]  Yeah, mid-2014.
[03:39.840 --> 03:42.200]  All right, I just, I psyched myself out of it.
[03:42.200 --> 03:44.280]  But anyway, I've had this adhesion problem
[03:44.280 --> 03:47.960]  around the bezel for like three, four years even,
[03:47.960 --> 03:51.120]  and Apple had a page, and it was a known defect,
[03:51.120 --> 03:53.160]  and their thing was just bring it into the store,
[03:53.160 --> 03:55.000]  we'll take one look at it, as soon as we eyeball it,
[03:55.000 --> 03:59.280]  we will take your MacBook away and fix it.
[03:59.280 --> 04:00.240]  I don't want them to fix it.
[04:00.240 --> 04:01.840]  I don't want to be without it for a day.
[04:01.840 --> 04:03.640]  And I kind of have grown,
[04:03.640 --> 04:05.840]  I went through the stages of grief
[04:05.840 --> 04:07.960]  with some kind of physical defect on it,
[04:07.960 --> 04:09.880]  where now I feel like it's charming.
[04:09.880 --> 04:13.880]  And it doesn't affect the pixel area.
[04:13.880 --> 04:16.440]  So it's not like there's a section of my screen
[04:16.440 --> 04:20.160]  at the right side where I'm looking at a defect.
[04:20.160 --> 04:22.640]  It really is only most noticeable when the screen is off.
[04:22.640 --> 04:25.320]  It's like, how often do I look at the screen when it's off?
[04:25.320 --> 04:27.440]  As soon as I lift the lid, the screen comes on.
[04:27.440 --> 04:30.440]  No, it's funny, I totally had that problem.
[04:30.440 --> 04:32.040]  Now that you mention it, I didn't even know
[04:32.040 --> 04:33.560]  what it was either, I just kind of ignored it.
[04:33.560 --> 04:36.320]  Yeah, because you're right, it wasn't on the screen,
[04:36.320 --> 04:39.840]  it looked like it was dirty, and it didn't really matter.
[04:39.840 --> 04:40.960]  Yeah, it looked like a weird stain,
[04:40.960 --> 04:42.800]  like you spit milk on your screen or something.
[04:42.800 --> 04:44.720]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[04:44.720 --> 04:47.760]  Or worse.
[04:47.760 --> 04:50.320]  But it really did, the first time I noticed it,
[04:50.320 --> 04:52.480]  it really was like a Lady Macbeth moment,
[04:52.480 --> 04:55.680]  where I'm sitting there huffing on the screen,
[04:55.680 --> 04:59.480]  and then they're like, oh, I better go get the serious screen
[04:59.480 --> 05:01.000]  cleaner.
[05:01.000 --> 05:03.000]  And nothing worked, and I'm like, what the hell?
[05:03.000 --> 05:05.120]  And then they Google it, and it's like, oh, a known defect.
[05:05.120 --> 05:07.720]  And then as soon as I found out it's a known defect,
[05:07.720 --> 05:10.000]  and I see Apple's policy, they will fix it,
[05:10.000 --> 05:12.760]  I immediately stand up and think, well,
[05:12.760 --> 05:14.800]  I'm going to walk to the Apple store right now.
[05:14.800 --> 05:16.720]  And then I thought about it, I don't
[05:16.720 --> 05:19.920]  want to be without this machine.
[05:19.920 --> 05:22.440]  I have a big, and I think you subscribe to the same theory,
[05:22.440 --> 05:25.920]  with my Macs, I have a very strong, if it ain't broke,
[05:25.920 --> 05:28.600]  don't replace it.
[05:28.600 --> 05:30.960]  Don't replace it, and don't update the OS
[05:30.960 --> 05:34.560]  until you absolutely have no choice.
[05:34.560 --> 05:37.520]  I didn't used to have that opinion with their OS.
[05:37.520 --> 05:41.600]  I guess I would never update on day one of a major new
[05:41.600 --> 05:44.160]  operating system, but I would upgrade quickly.
[05:44.160 --> 05:48.080]  But now I'm, I don't think I upgraded to Catalina,
[05:48.080 --> 05:49.800]  no, not Catalina, Catalina's the next one.
[05:49.800 --> 05:50.600]  Mojave.
[05:50.600 --> 05:52.320]  I'm sick of these goddamn names.
[05:52.320 --> 05:56.280]  I'm 10-14, I didn't upgrade to 10-14 until June.
[05:56.280 --> 05:58.320]  Yeah, no, same here.
[05:58.320 --> 06:02.680]  And it disrupts your day for an hour, hour and a half,
[06:02.680 --> 06:06.800]  and I don't know.
[06:06.800 --> 06:09.200]  Actually, this frustrates me about the way
[06:09.200 --> 06:11.960]  Apple has dealt with Macs.
[06:11.960 --> 06:15.560]  The Mac is a pure work machine.
[06:15.560 --> 06:17.560]  I don't use it really for anything other than work.
[06:17.560 --> 06:20.040]  I use my phone for almost everything else.
[06:20.040 --> 06:22.960]  There's a certain number of things I need the Mac to do
[06:22.960 --> 06:26.160]  and do them very, very well, and I don't need anything else,
[06:26.160 --> 06:27.800]  and I want them to do it perfectly
[06:27.800 --> 06:29.920]  and to never disrupt anything.
[06:29.920 --> 06:31.160]  That's all I want from the computer.
[06:31.160 --> 06:33.360]  I don't need any bells and whistles,
[06:33.360 --> 06:34.560]  anything along those lines.
[06:34.560 --> 06:35.960]  All I want is it to do those things,
[06:35.960 --> 06:37.600]  and once it's set up and it's doing those things,
[06:37.600 --> 06:38.840]  I don't wanna mess with it.
[06:38.840 --> 06:42.200]  Yep, no, I feel the same way, and I don't know.
[06:42.200 --> 06:44.440]  I will probably upgrade to Catalina earlier
[06:44.440 --> 06:49.440]  than I did 10-14 because I'm stupid,
[06:49.600 --> 06:52.760]  but there are some things in Catalina
[06:52.760 --> 06:54.080]  that I really do wanna use.
[06:54.080 --> 06:57.480]  I do feel like there is one huge tent pole feature
[06:57.480 --> 07:01.360]  in 10-15 Catalina, and that is what they're calling sidecar,
[07:01.360 --> 07:05.520]  which is the ability to use an iPad,
[07:05.520 --> 07:09.840]  either wirelessly or connected, like by a USB cable,
[07:09.840 --> 07:13.160]  as a external display, and then you could draw on it
[07:13.160 --> 07:14.520]  and stuff like that.
[07:14.520 --> 07:18.800]  Yeah, no, I used to use Duet.
[07:18.800 --> 07:20.040]  I think I still have Duet.
[07:22.400 --> 07:24.960]  During the summer, I'm usually back in the States
[07:24.960 --> 07:27.560]  most of the summer, and I will occasionally,
[07:27.560 --> 07:28.760]  especially during earning season,
[07:28.760 --> 07:31.560]  when I'm looking at spreadsheets and stuff like that,
[07:31.560 --> 07:33.800]  I will set up, I have a 13-inch iPad,
[07:33.800 --> 07:35.600]  and I will use it just as a screen.
[07:35.600 --> 07:37.720]  So Duet doesn't do the whole touch thing.
[07:37.720 --> 07:42.400]  It's just a secondary display, but it is very useful.
[07:42.400 --> 07:46.400]  And then there's the third-party thing called Luma Display.
[07:46.400 --> 07:47.880]  Yeah, that's the one that actually does
[07:47.880 --> 07:48.720]  incorporate the touch stuff.
[07:48.720 --> 07:51.520]  But that requires a kernel extension, I think.
[07:51.520 --> 07:56.040]  Well, no, sort of.
[07:56.040 --> 08:00.200]  So Luma Display is a very intriguing product,
[08:00.200 --> 08:03.600]  and I would still encourage people to look at it
[08:03.600 --> 08:04.920]  and consider it.
[08:04.920 --> 08:08.120]  There's a very strong chance that this sidecar thing
[08:08.120 --> 08:10.120]  in Catalina is going to Sherlock them and put them
[08:10.120 --> 08:13.440]  out of business, or at least put that product out of business.
[08:13.440 --> 08:16.400]  But the idea with Luma, I think it was a Kickstarter.
[08:16.400 --> 08:19.880]  And if it wasn't Kickstarter, it was Indiegogo
[08:19.880 --> 08:21.400]  or one of those similar things.
[08:21.400 --> 08:22.640]  But they raised money.
[08:22.640 --> 08:24.600]  It was a hardware and software product.
[08:24.600 --> 08:26.680]  So there's two things that could go wrong.
[08:26.680 --> 08:28.120]  And they completely pulled it off.
[08:28.120 --> 08:30.000]  I believe they were on time.
[08:30.000 --> 08:31.960]  And it works exactly as advertised.
[08:31.960 --> 08:34.200]  Oh, yeah, and they're totally wireless,
[08:34.200 --> 08:36.400]  whereas the Duet required a cord.
[08:36.400 --> 08:38.040]  And the other thing with Duet is the Duet
[08:38.040 --> 08:39.360]  didn't fill the screen properly.
[08:39.360 --> 08:43.040]  Whereas just looking at the website of the Luma Display,
[08:43.040 --> 08:46.280]  it clearly looks like a much better product
[08:46.280 --> 08:47.160]  than what I was using.
[08:47.160 --> 08:48.760]  So it's super clever.
[08:48.760 --> 08:51.240]  So the hardware part is a dongle.
[08:51.240 --> 08:53.120]  And you have to buy the one for your machine.
[08:53.120 --> 08:55.120]  So they have a DisplayPort one, or whatever
[08:55.120 --> 08:57.960]  it's called, for an older MacBook Pro like mine,
[08:57.960 --> 09:01.600]  and a USB-C one for the newer ones with Thunderbolt.
[09:01.600 --> 09:04.600]  And you know how you can plug an actual external display
[09:04.600 --> 09:05.840]  into those ports?
[09:05.840 --> 09:08.120]  Well, this is just a little dongle
[09:08.120 --> 09:10.720]  like what used to come with a mouse,
[09:10.720 --> 09:12.920]  like you'd plug a thing into your USB-C,
[09:12.920 --> 09:15.560]  or like a clicker for a presentation.
[09:15.560 --> 09:18.560]  And you'd put a little wireless thing into your USB port.
[09:18.560 --> 09:20.680]  And it only sticks out a little tiny bit.
[09:20.680 --> 09:27.200]  But it goes into DisplayPort, by which I mean lowercase d,
[09:27.200 --> 09:30.920]  lowercase p, DisplayPort, the port on your computer
[09:30.920 --> 09:33.440]  that thinks it's for displays.
[09:33.440 --> 09:34.840]  So as soon as it goes in, your Mac
[09:34.840 --> 09:37.480]  thinks a display has been plugged in, and says, OK,
[09:37.480 --> 09:38.840]  now you have an external display.
[09:38.840 --> 09:40.920]  But it's just a little wireless dongle
[09:40.920 --> 09:44.160]  that communicates to their app on your iPad.
[09:44.160 --> 09:46.680]  And all of a sudden, boom, your iPad
[09:46.680 --> 09:48.840]  is an external display for your Mac.
[09:48.840 --> 09:52.840]  The kernel extension part is, without installing their kernel
[09:52.840 --> 09:55.720]  extension, you don't get retouch.
[09:55.720 --> 09:56.720]  You don't get retinal.
[09:56.720 --> 09:58.440]  Oh, retinal, that's what it is, OK.
[09:58.440 --> 10:04.600]  So the iPad shows up with non-retina graphics.
[10:04.600 --> 10:09.040]  So every pixel is actually four pixels on the display.
[10:09.040 --> 10:13.880]  And in a weird way, when you have a retina display showing
[10:13.880 --> 10:17.760]  a non-retina thing, to me it looks worse
[10:17.760 --> 10:20.640]  than an actual non-retina display.
[10:20.640 --> 10:23.040]  Because if you have an actual non-retina display,
[10:23.040 --> 10:28.160]  like an older iPad pre-retina, the pixels are fuzzy.
[10:28.160 --> 10:30.840]  So the fact that it doesn't look as good as retina,
[10:30.840 --> 10:32.840]  but there's a fuzziness to it that kind of,
[10:32.840 --> 10:36.880]  it's like de facto anti-aliasing almost.
[10:36.880 --> 10:38.680]  Whereas when you have a retina display,
[10:38.680 --> 10:43.000]  and it's using four pixels to show one pixel,
[10:43.000 --> 10:46.240]  the pixeliness is super sharp.
[10:46.240 --> 10:49.600]  It is very pixelated.
[10:49.600 --> 10:53.480]  And I just didn't, I bought it to support them.
[10:53.480 --> 10:56.360]  Idiot that I am, it's like, sure, I'll spend 200 bucks
[10:56.360 --> 10:58.080]  or whatever it was to see if this works.
[10:58.080 --> 10:59.880]  And then I saw that it worked.
[10:59.880 --> 11:01.160]  And it's not that I don't trust them.
[11:01.160 --> 11:04.480]  I believe that the team is like former Apple engineers.
[11:04.480 --> 11:07.920]  And I know people who use this product
[11:08.960 --> 11:10.520]  and have the kernel extension displayed.
[11:10.520 --> 11:12.120]  And I've never once heard of anybody saying,
[11:12.120 --> 11:14.160]  yeah, I had crashed my machine or anything.
[11:14.160 --> 11:15.480]  No problems at all.
[11:15.480 --> 11:18.360]  So I'm not even bad mouthing it.
[11:18.360 --> 11:20.040]  I just didn't feel like installing it.
[11:20.040 --> 11:20.880]  So I didn't use it.
[11:20.880 --> 11:22.200]  It's $70 for the record.
[11:22.200 --> 11:23.520]  There you go, 70 bucks.
[11:23.520 --> 11:26.880]  So if you're, it's something for people to look at.
[11:26.880 --> 11:30.680]  But anyway, it might be put out of business, unfortunately.
[11:30.680 --> 11:31.880]  We'll see what they do.
[11:33.360 --> 11:36.560]  But anyway, so I'll probably upgrade to 10.15 earlier
[11:36.560 --> 11:37.400]  than later.
[11:37.400 --> 11:40.000]  I'm just hoping that those new MacBook Pros come out
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.400]  because I will be first in line to get them.
[11:43.520 --> 11:45.360]  I mean, the problem for me is,
[11:47.560 --> 11:49.440]  I committed to a certain deadline.
[11:49.440 --> 11:51.160]  So I have to write four days a week.
[11:51.160 --> 11:56.160]  And so to travel with the constant fear
[11:56.160 --> 11:58.580]  that my computer is going to stop working,
[11:58.580 --> 12:00.140]  it just drives me up the wall.
[12:00.140 --> 12:01.960]  Like it's, I just,
[12:03.580 --> 12:05.940]  I feel like this current computer I have
[12:05.940 --> 12:10.940]  is just like a constant low grade worry, like all the time.
[12:10.980 --> 12:12.940]  And like, if something like,
[12:12.940 --> 12:15.860]  I see some speck of dust fall on it or like,
[12:15.860 --> 12:16.820]  I mean, I just like.
[12:16.820 --> 12:17.780]  Wait, which one do you have?
[12:17.780 --> 12:19.180]  What is your laptop?
[12:19.180 --> 12:21.440]  I have the MacBook escape.
[12:21.440 --> 12:25.500]  So the one with only two ports and non touch bar.
[12:25.500 --> 12:26.500]  Is it the new one?
[12:26.500 --> 12:27.860]  Like the one that was updated?
[12:27.860 --> 12:29.340]  No, no, it's not.
[12:29.340 --> 12:33.940]  It's whenever I, 2017 maybe, something like that.
[12:33.940 --> 12:38.060]  So yeah, so no, so it has the old,
[12:38.060 --> 12:40.500]  I think it's the second generation.
[12:40.500 --> 12:42.960]  So it's, but it doesn't have the membrane
[12:42.960 --> 12:43.920]  or whatever it is.
[12:45.220 --> 12:46.860]  And, but the other thing too is I feel,
[12:46.860 --> 12:47.940]  yeah, I'm just getting older.
[12:47.940 --> 12:50.320]  And the 13s are nice, but like,
[12:50.320 --> 12:51.860]  I feel, especially in those summers
[12:51.860 --> 12:53.580]  when I'm using it every day, I'm like, yeah,
[12:53.580 --> 12:56.780]  I should, I would be, I could use a bigger screen here, so.
[12:56.780 --> 12:58.260]  So anyway, I never fixed my screen.
[12:58.260 --> 12:59.380]  Don't want to now.
[12:59.380 --> 13:01.060]  It's charming to me.
[13:01.060 --> 13:03.040]  So I'm rocking it until Apple comes out
[13:03.040 --> 13:06.540]  with a MacBook Pro that I feel is appealing, hopefully soon.
[13:06.540 --> 13:09.940]  So it may be, this beloved computer will be retired soon.
[13:09.940 --> 13:10.780]  I don't know.
[13:12.580 --> 13:14.580]  But anyway, I kicked the cord out.
[13:14.580 --> 13:16.020]  And every time that happens, I think,
[13:16.020 --> 13:18.260]  I wonder what the hell I'll do when that's a USB-C thing.
[13:18.260 --> 13:21.540]  And it's gonna like, is it gonna yank my whole?
[13:21.540 --> 13:22.740]  It's gonna be off the table.
[13:22.740 --> 13:24.380]  I haven't heard a lot of stories from people.
[13:24.380 --> 13:28.780]  Like, when Apple first went USB-C only
[13:28.780 --> 13:32.280]  for power and everything and got rid of MagSafe with these,
[13:32.280 --> 13:34.660]  there was lots of people saying, wow, that's a shame.
[13:34.660 --> 13:35.580]  I loved MagSafe.
[13:35.580 --> 13:38.380]  Seems like an odd feature to do away with.
[13:38.380 --> 13:41.780]  But I haven't really heard stories from people like,
[13:41.780 --> 13:44.120]  son of a bitching because they kicked the cable
[13:44.120 --> 13:46.020]  and their laptop fell over,
[13:46.020 --> 13:47.880]  fell off the table or desk and broke.
[13:47.880 --> 13:49.380]  I haven't heard that.
[13:49.380 --> 13:54.380]  So maybe the USB-C cables come out easily enough.
[13:54.740 --> 13:55.580]  I don't know.
[13:56.460 --> 13:58.340]  Yeah, I think they do come out easier.
[13:59.780 --> 14:03.420]  I've found to be less of an issue than I thought as well.
[14:03.420 --> 14:04.900]  And actually it's nice in some ways.
[14:04.900 --> 14:08.100]  Again, one of my biggest cases is on airplanes.
[14:08.100 --> 14:11.180]  And it's more likely that you're just gonna
[14:11.180 --> 14:15.020]  kind of knock out the MagSafe there when you don't want to.
[14:15.020 --> 14:17.540]  And in this case, the fact that it's a little sturdier
[14:17.540 --> 14:18.620]  is a nice thing.
[14:18.620 --> 14:20.780]  And I would imagine having it on both sides.
[14:20.780 --> 14:22.540]  You could plug it on either side would be pretty handy,
[14:22.540 --> 14:24.620]  but the one I have only has ports on one side.
[14:24.620 --> 14:26.580]  So it's kind of a moot point.
[14:26.580 --> 14:27.900]  Yeah, the two side thing would be nice,
[14:27.900 --> 14:29.580]  but you don't have it.
[14:29.580 --> 14:33.940]  Well, I mean, I just, I have no desire for a touch bar.
[14:33.940 --> 14:37.100]  So, but that's, we'll see.
[14:37.100 --> 14:39.840]  Do you think the 16 inch or whatever this rumored new one
[14:39.840 --> 14:41.100]  is gonna have a touch bar?
[14:42.240 --> 14:43.080]  That's a good question.
[14:43.080 --> 14:44.380]  I think yes.
[14:44.380 --> 14:48.240]  And I wonder though, because it seems like universally
[14:48.240 --> 14:51.780]  the touch bar is considered either.
[14:51.780 --> 14:53.300]  I don't know anyone that likes the touch bar.
[14:53.300 --> 14:55.580]  Like literally, I don't think I know a single person.
[14:55.580 --> 14:58.500]  I would say the range of opinion only goes
[14:58.500 --> 15:03.340]  from despising it to ambivalence.
[15:03.340 --> 15:05.540]  And I don't know anybody who actually likes it.
[15:05.540 --> 15:08.100]  Like to me, the best sentiment I can,
[15:08.100 --> 15:12.220]  I know of anybody who has about it is eh, that's okay.
[15:12.220 --> 15:13.220]  You know, it's.
[15:13.220 --> 15:15.140]  Yeah, it's fine.
[15:15.140 --> 15:16.100]  It's fine.
[15:16.100 --> 15:20.820]  Whereas I know other people who truly despise it.
[15:20.820 --> 15:21.700]  Well, and it's interesting
[15:21.700 --> 15:24.300]  because they did dump the 3D touch on the phone,
[15:24.300 --> 15:26.100]  which I really liked.
[15:26.100 --> 15:28.580]  I'm disappointed that it's gone.
[15:28.580 --> 15:31.700]  I can understand, like anything that's not discoverable
[15:31.700 --> 15:33.560]  is just sort of fundamentally problematic.
[15:33.560 --> 15:35.740]  So I can understand why it's gone.
[15:35.740 --> 15:38.580]  But I do, I really like the iPhone 11.
[15:38.580 --> 15:40.940]  I think it's a great phone.
[15:40.940 --> 15:43.400]  The camera is obviously amazing.
[15:43.400 --> 15:47.420]  I feel particularly great because I have the green model
[15:47.420 --> 15:50.380]  with the yellow gold leather case.
[15:50.380 --> 15:53.100]  So it has my Green Bay Packers colors.
[15:53.100 --> 15:55.220]  Looks very sharp, very sharp.
[15:55.220 --> 15:56.940]  But I do miss 3D touch a lot.
[15:56.940 --> 15:58.940]  Like a lot more than I expected.
[15:58.940 --> 16:03.340]  Well, and the shame of it is that we should skip,
[16:03.340 --> 16:05.580]  I have iPhone 11 as an entire topic
[16:05.580 --> 16:07.980]  so we can table most of this for that.
[16:07.980 --> 16:12.980]  But I feel the shame of it with 3D touch is that it's like,
[16:12.980 --> 16:16.140]  now it's gone in all of the new phones.
[16:16.140 --> 16:19.580]  And so the future is clear that iOS devices,
[16:19.580 --> 16:22.320]  it's this haptic touch going forward.
[16:22.320 --> 16:24.100]  But the worst part is that for devices
[16:24.100 --> 16:28.100]  that do have 3D touch, like a year old iPhone,
[16:28.100 --> 16:30.420]  it's finally implemented the way
[16:30.420 --> 16:32.100]  it should have been all along.
[16:32.100 --> 16:35.660]  Where I've been, I don't know if I've written
[16:35.660 --> 16:38.860]  strongly enough about it, but all along I have thought
[16:38.860 --> 16:41.340]  the discoverability is a bit of an issue,
[16:41.340 --> 16:44.460]  but I feel the bigger problem is the,
[16:44.460 --> 16:49.460]  has always been the overloading of similar.
[16:49.900 --> 16:51.660]  That's right, because you had both long press
[16:51.660 --> 16:54.000]  and you had 3D touch at the same time.
[16:54.000 --> 16:54.840]  Right.
[16:54.840 --> 16:55.660]  So that's a great point.
[16:55.660 --> 16:57.400]  Yeah, you should only have one of the two.
[16:57.400 --> 16:58.240]  Right.
[16:58.240 --> 17:00.340]  And it'd be great if the only one was 3D touch
[17:00.340 --> 17:02.140]  and instead the only one is long press.
[17:02.140 --> 17:04.380]  Right, so just look no further than the home screen.
[17:04.380 --> 17:07.340]  An aspect of the iPhone that everybody has to deal with
[17:07.340 --> 17:10.060]  in some way and a long press on an icon
[17:10.060 --> 17:12.980]  put you into jiggle mode to delete or rearrange apps
[17:12.980 --> 17:15.700]  and a 3D touch got you the shortcut menu.
[17:15.700 --> 17:19.860]  But that is a really fine distinction in terms of,
[17:19.860 --> 17:21.660]  I have always thought that 3D touch
[17:21.660 --> 17:24.980]  should just be a faster way to do a long touch.
[17:24.980 --> 17:27.020]  It's a long touch without waiting for the long.
[17:27.020 --> 17:29.180]  You can just skip that delay.
[17:29.180 --> 17:30.740]  And now that's what it is.
[17:30.740 --> 17:33.860]  If you still have a phone with 3D touch, which is awesome,
[17:33.860 --> 17:35.260]  which is what it should have been all along
[17:35.260 --> 17:36.940]  and it's unified the interface
[17:36.940 --> 17:38.660]  and it's the same set of things.
[17:38.660 --> 17:42.020]  And I have a new iPhone and so I'm stuck with the delay.
[17:43.100 --> 17:44.180]  It really does annoy me.
[17:44.180 --> 17:46.380]  I heard the ATP guys bitching about it.
[17:47.500 --> 17:48.720]  I think I'm an episode behind now,
[17:48.720 --> 17:51.060]  but their second to last episode was the episode
[17:51.060 --> 17:55.780]  where Casey and Marco just got in their new phones
[17:55.780 --> 17:59.980]  and were maybe even like the day or day before they recorded
[17:59.980 --> 18:01.560]  and they were both being driven nuts
[18:01.560 --> 18:03.220]  by the delay on the home screen
[18:03.220 --> 18:05.940]  when you press and hold on the camera button.
[18:05.940 --> 18:07.180]  Well, the lock screen.
[18:07.180 --> 18:08.020]  Lock screen.
[18:08.020 --> 18:09.220]  Lock screen is particularly annoying.
[18:09.220 --> 18:10.820]  That's what I meant, lock screen.
[18:11.820 --> 18:13.820]  You kind of get used to it after you've had the phone
[18:13.820 --> 18:16.500]  for a week or two, but not really.
[18:16.500 --> 18:19.140]  I mean, it always seems like it should be faster
[18:19.140 --> 18:23.300]  and it is very, very strange that the phones are literally,
[18:24.860 --> 18:27.500]  they literally have the fastest single core performance
[18:27.500 --> 18:30.340]  of any computing device Apple has ever sold.
[18:30.340 --> 18:34.980]  So, the iMac Pro is definitely a faster computer
[18:34.980 --> 18:36.500]  at multi-core stuff and that's really
[18:36.500 --> 18:38.980]  what the Pro workflows are optimized for.
[18:38.980 --> 18:42.580]  So, it's not a faster computer overall than an iMac Pro,
[18:42.580 --> 18:46.060]  but on single core, which a lot of things you do
[18:46.060 --> 18:50.600]  are on one thread, it is the fastest computer they sell.
[18:50.600 --> 18:52.340]  It's a phone, a cell phone,
[18:52.340 --> 18:55.140]  that is the fastest single core computer Apple sells.
[18:55.140 --> 18:57.540]  And yet, getting to the camera takes longer,
[18:57.540 --> 18:58.900]  which is very frustrating.
[18:59.740 --> 19:00.700]  All right, let me take a break.
[19:00.700 --> 19:02.540]  Thank our first sponsor,
[19:02.540 --> 19:04.220]  to our good friends at Squarespace.
[19:04.220 --> 19:07.460]  Boy, do I like Squarespace.
[19:07.460 --> 19:09.620]  You can build just about any website
[19:09.620 --> 19:11.340]  you can imagine using Squarespace.
[19:11.340 --> 19:13.660]  And I'll tell you what, you probably don't know it,
[19:13.660 --> 19:16.740]  but every week, you probably visit several websites
[19:16.740 --> 19:18.000]  that were built with Squarespace.
[19:18.000 --> 19:21.140]  And you, the person just visiting the website,
[19:21.140 --> 19:22.820]  maybe it's a restaurant you wanna check the hours
[19:22.820 --> 19:24.500]  to find out when they're open,
[19:24.500 --> 19:26.540]  look at the menu, that sort of thing.
[19:28.260 --> 19:32.740]  Maybe it's a designer or somebody's blog,
[19:32.740 --> 19:34.660]  maybe it's a podcast, and you're going
[19:34.660 --> 19:36.620]  to check out their website, guess what?
[19:36.620 --> 19:38.800]  Very good chance that if it's a new website
[19:38.800 --> 19:39.640]  built in the last few years,
[19:39.640 --> 19:40.820]  it might be built with Squarespace.
[19:40.820 --> 19:43.220]  And you wouldn't know, and you shouldn't know,
[19:43.220 --> 19:45.180]  because they're just great websites.
[19:47.380 --> 19:49.180]  When you build a new website using Squarespace,
[19:49.180 --> 19:50.720]  you get to start with a whole bunch
[19:50.720 --> 19:52.820]  of professionally designed templates,
[19:52.820 --> 19:56.020]  templates that work and scale to any size screen.
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.260]  You can adjust them to any degree you want
[19:59.260 --> 20:01.580]  to make the brand of the website your own.
[20:01.580 --> 20:05.620]  And you do it all without needing to know any sort of code.
[20:05.620 --> 20:07.420]  You can just do it all, WYSIWYG,
[20:07.420 --> 20:09.960]  right there in your browser.
[20:10.980 --> 20:13.180]  They have great technical support,
[20:13.180 --> 20:16.520]  and they offer everything from registering domains
[20:16.520 --> 20:18.500]  to analytics, so you can see the stats,
[20:18.500 --> 20:20.900]  who's visiting your website, where they come from,
[20:22.260 --> 20:24.400]  to all the design stuff you would need,
[20:24.400 --> 20:29.400]  to the CMS type stuff for entering a new blog post,
[20:29.640 --> 20:31.420]  posting a new podcast, all of it.
[20:31.420 --> 20:33.740]  You go through Squarespace.
[20:33.740 --> 20:35.080]  You don't need to install anything else.
[20:35.080 --> 20:36.580]  You don't need to install software updates.
[20:36.580 --> 20:39.900]  You don't need to worry about keeping the server up to date
[20:39.900 --> 20:41.900]  with security patches and stuff like that.
[20:41.900 --> 20:45.260]  All of that just happens automatically with Squarespace.
[20:46.340 --> 20:48.740]  Intuitive, easy to use, everything you'd want.
[20:48.740 --> 20:49.780]  So here's what you do.
[20:49.780 --> 20:51.620]  You get a free trial, 30 days.
[20:51.620 --> 20:52.900]  You don't even have to pay a nickel.

[21:03.780 --> 21:05.740]  My thanks to Squarespace for their
[21:05.740 --> 21:08.780]  continuing years long support of this podcast.
[21:10.620 --> 21:13.380]  Hey, speaking of new laptops,
[21:16.820 --> 21:20.500]  Microsoft had an event two days ago, I believe.
[21:21.740 --> 21:23.080]  They did.
[21:23.080 --> 21:23.920]  Where was it?
[21:23.920 --> 21:24.740]  And this was right.
[21:24.740 --> 21:25.580]  Where the hell did they even have it?
[21:25.580 --> 21:26.540]  I was in New York, in New York City.
[21:26.540 --> 21:28.140]  So yeah, you were down the road.
[21:28.140 --> 21:31.300]  Yeah, I should've gone.
[21:31.300 --> 21:33.140]  I don't think to ask for things like that
[21:33.140 --> 21:34.220]  until after the event.
[21:34.220 --> 21:35.660]  I'd probably be like, gosh.
[21:38.460 --> 21:40.020]  But it was really interesting.
[21:40.020 --> 21:43.260]  And you were up late, as you are right now.
[21:43.260 --> 21:44.140]  I was up early.
[21:45.900 --> 21:49.260]  And I was following along live.
[21:49.260 --> 21:52.300]  And I thought it was an interesting event.
[21:52.300 --> 21:53.860]  I think they're doing some interesting stuff.
[21:53.860 --> 21:58.660]  And then at the very end, I think that they blew it.
[21:58.660 --> 22:02.060]  But you commented, I know we were chatting with each other,
[22:02.060 --> 22:04.220]  that one of the first things they did,
[22:04.220 --> 22:05.540]  and I don't know which segment it was,
[22:05.540 --> 22:06.980]  if they were talking about their laptop
[22:06.980 --> 22:09.300]  or their two-in-ones with the detachable keyboards,
[22:09.300 --> 22:11.740]  but they made a pointed reference
[22:11.740 --> 22:13.140]  up there in front of the audience
[22:13.140 --> 22:16.340]  that one of the things they would never compromise on
[22:16.340 --> 22:17.740]  is the keyboard, which...
[22:17.740 --> 22:21.620]  Yeah, we wanna make sure that it always works.
[22:21.620 --> 22:22.980]  It's always there for you.
[22:22.980 --> 22:25.140]  Your computer is something you can trust.
[22:25.140 --> 22:28.260]  And then what was great is not only did the presenter
[22:28.260 --> 22:30.900]  say the keyboard, but before he said the keyboard,
[22:30.900 --> 22:33.060]  the slide cut to the keyboard.
[22:33.060 --> 22:36.260]  So it was first a visual reminder
[22:36.260 --> 22:38.220]  and then the pregnant pause,
[22:38.220 --> 22:40.580]  and then the actual statement of,
[22:40.580 --> 22:42.100]  for example, the keyboard.
[22:43.100 --> 22:45.140]  So the only thing they could have done
[22:45.140 --> 22:46.260]  to make it more clear would have been
[22:46.260 --> 22:48.860]  to pause the whole thing and start winking.
[22:48.860 --> 22:52.980]  Right?
[22:52.980 --> 22:55.420]  To know what they're referring to.
[22:55.420 --> 22:59.700]  And that's fair game.
[22:59.700 --> 23:02.140]  Apple did this to themselves.
[23:02.140 --> 23:04.780]  This is a legitimate...
[23:04.780 --> 23:07.340]  Microsoft has had some ham-fisted marketing,
[23:08.260 --> 23:09.740]  to say the least, over the years.
[23:09.740 --> 23:12.940]  I mean, they held a funeral for the iPhone at one point.
[23:14.060 --> 23:15.980]  They literally had a funeral procession
[23:15.980 --> 23:20.660]  marching around Redmond, Washington.
[23:20.660 --> 23:23.020]  Turns out iPhone wasn't dead at the time.
[23:24.300 --> 23:25.420]  Turns out.
[23:25.420 --> 23:30.420]  But this keyboard thing with MacBooks is a legitimate issue.
[23:30.540 --> 23:34.420]  And we can argue about the severity of it.
[23:34.420 --> 23:37.740]  Certainly it seems as though it has been mitigated
[23:37.740 --> 23:42.020]  to some degree, finally, with the combination
[23:42.020 --> 23:44.940]  of the membrane and the quote-unquote material change
[23:44.940 --> 23:49.060]  that they made over the summer with the current keyboards,
[23:49.060 --> 23:50.300]  if you go in and buy one today,
[23:50.300 --> 23:52.420]  or if you get your old one serviced.
[23:53.620 --> 23:56.220]  But they're not great keyboards, period, in my opinion.
[23:56.220 --> 24:00.180]  Even if your keys work as they are designed
[24:00.180 --> 24:03.220]  on your keyboard, I just don't think they're great keyboards.
[24:03.220 --> 24:04.340]  So I feel like...
[24:04.340 --> 24:08.700]  And to me, as a writer, the keyboard is very important.
[24:08.700 --> 24:10.540]  I'm also very picky about my keyboard,
[24:10.540 --> 24:11.980]  so it's even more important.
[24:11.980 --> 24:14.060]  And there are an awful lot of people out there,
[24:14.060 --> 24:16.220]  maybe their business card doesn't say writer,
[24:16.220 --> 24:18.700]  but there are certainly an awful lot of people out there
[24:18.700 --> 24:22.100]  whose day-to-day work involves a lot of typing, right?
[24:22.100 --> 24:25.180]  That's just what it means to be a worker
[24:25.180 --> 24:28.060]  in our generation, in the world today.
[24:28.060 --> 24:32.220]  You send emails, you do presentations, you're in Slack,
[24:32.220 --> 24:34.860]  or I guess in the Microsoft world, you're on Teams,
[24:34.860 --> 24:37.260]  or whatever they call their thing.
[24:37.260 --> 24:39.780]  People doing work are doing a lot of typing.
[24:40.700 --> 24:43.340]  So that's fair game, good for them.
[24:43.340 --> 24:45.900]  And Microsoft has always made good peripherals.
[24:45.900 --> 24:48.580]  We know they've always made good mice.
[24:50.620 --> 24:51.620]  I have a Microsoft keyboard sitting
[24:51.620 --> 24:52.700]  in front of me right now.
[24:52.700 --> 24:55.620]  Do you are a devotee of the Microsoft keyboard?
[24:55.620 --> 24:56.460]  What's it called?
[24:56.460 --> 24:57.860]  Is that the one that Marco has too?
[24:57.860 --> 24:59.580]  Yeah, the same one as Marco, yeah.
[24:59.580 --> 25:01.420]  The first version of the Sculpt keyboard.
[25:01.420 --> 25:03.300]  It's a great keyboard.
[25:05.540 --> 25:07.540]  I love, yeah, it's just a great keyboard.
[25:10.220 --> 25:11.700]  And the keys are great.
[25:11.700 --> 25:14.220]  And my wife has a Surface laptop also.
[25:14.220 --> 25:16.780]  And it's a great computer.
[25:19.100 --> 25:21.820]  I didn't like the look of that weird felt sort of thing,
[25:21.820 --> 25:23.220]  but actually, once you actually use it,
[25:23.220 --> 25:24.420]  it's not nearly as bad.
[25:24.420 --> 25:27.900]  Actually, she has this blue color that looks quite sharp.
[25:27.900 --> 25:29.340]  The keyboard's great.
[25:29.340 --> 25:30.860]  The hardware is fantastic.
[25:30.860 --> 25:34.820]  And they actually, Microsoft laptops,
[25:34.820 --> 25:36.620]  they actually have good track pads,
[25:36.620 --> 25:40.860]  which is always like bugaboo on PCs in general.
[25:40.860 --> 25:42.820]  The hardware is really, really, really good.
[25:42.820 --> 25:45.100]  I mean, obviously, it's Windows, it's not Mac OS,
[25:45.100 --> 25:48.540]  and that's, for many folks, a deal breaker.
[25:48.540 --> 25:51.020]  But as far as just the pure hardware goes,
[25:51.020 --> 25:53.300]  I think given this keyboard issue,
[25:53.300 --> 25:55.140]  I think it's pretty safe to say
[25:55.140 --> 25:58.380]  that Microsoft makes the best laptops in the industry.
[25:59.500 --> 26:00.340]  They do.
[26:00.340 --> 26:03.220]  There's nothing, they work, it's what they said.
[26:03.220 --> 26:04.860]  So at the end, they look great.
[26:04.860 --> 26:07.300]  They have a better port selection.
[26:07.300 --> 26:08.260]  They have great screens.
[26:08.260 --> 26:09.100]  They have great keyboards.
[26:09.100 --> 26:11.220]  They have great track pads.
[26:11.220 --> 26:12.060]  Yeah, and that gets-
[26:12.060 --> 26:13.140]  It's a fair shot.
[26:13.140 --> 26:16.820]  And that's a recurring theme in my writing for years,
[26:16.820 --> 26:17.780]  ever since I've been doing it,
[26:17.780 --> 26:22.460]  that for me, the OS is primary and the hardware secondary.
[26:22.460 --> 26:26.060]  And I've always said that I would much rather, by far,
[26:26.060 --> 26:27.300]  without a moment's hesitation,
[26:27.300 --> 26:30.660]  use Mac OS on PC hardware
[26:30.660 --> 26:33.660]  than use Windows on MacBook hardware.
[26:33.660 --> 26:35.660]  And the same way with iOS and Android,
[26:35.660 --> 26:39.020]  but it's far stronger of a preference Mac versus Windows
[26:39.020 --> 26:40.740]  than Android versus iOS.
[26:43.900 --> 26:45.220]  Even now, that's a strong preference.
[26:45.220 --> 26:46.060]  But-
[26:46.060 --> 26:47.100]  It's funny, because in many respects,
[26:47.100 --> 26:48.020]  that's what a Surface is.
[26:48.020 --> 26:52.540]  It's basically MacBook quality, but it runs Windows.
[26:52.540 --> 26:55.340]  But I am fully cognizant of the fact
[26:55.340 --> 26:59.580]  that there are many people who don't feel that way
[26:59.580 --> 27:03.500]  and have either through ambivalence
[27:03.500 --> 27:07.140]  or through deliberate choice in the software
[27:07.140 --> 27:10.460]  that they choose to use can switch
[27:10.460 --> 27:12.460]  between platforms rather easily.
[27:14.220 --> 27:18.700]  Certainly, if you have a mostly web app workflow,
[27:18.700 --> 27:23.700]  it's almost trivial to switch from one OS,
[27:24.020 --> 27:26.500]  Windows to Mac to Chrome OS,
[27:26.500 --> 27:28.460]  because you're just using browser tabs.
[27:29.620 --> 27:31.660]  And there's people who use real apps
[27:31.660 --> 27:35.060]  who still are fed up.
[27:35.060 --> 27:36.380]  I get email from people who are like,
[27:36.380 --> 27:38.980]  I've been a Mac user for a while,
[27:38.980 --> 27:41.140]  and I had a bum keyboard, so to hell with it.
[27:41.140 --> 27:44.660]  I bought some Windows thing, and I'm very happy with it.
[27:45.580 --> 27:47.260]  So there's certainly a lot of people like that,
[27:47.260 --> 27:50.260]  and Microsoft is certainly pitching them.
[27:50.260 --> 27:52.820]  And it's more than just that the hardware is good too.
[27:52.820 --> 27:54.740]  The other thing that I always thought
[27:54.740 --> 27:58.860]  was part of the Surface appeal,
[27:58.860 --> 28:01.540]  and you wrote about this this week on Stratechery
[28:01.540 --> 28:03.420]  and your coverage of the Microsoft event,
[28:03.420 --> 28:05.820]  is why do they even make hardware?
[28:05.820 --> 28:07.180]  It's a good question, right?
[28:07.180 --> 28:10.380]  And it's certainly not important to Microsoft financially.
[28:10.380 --> 28:11.220]  But I always thought,
[28:11.220 --> 28:12.540]  I thought the one thing maybe you didn't mention
[28:12.540 --> 28:14.860]  in your coverage was that part of it was,
[28:14.860 --> 28:17.140]  I think internally, they were just a little fed up
[28:17.140 --> 28:19.020]  with all the shovelware and crapware
[28:19.020 --> 28:21.380]  that all the OEMs put in.
[28:22.380 --> 28:25.300]  In the same way that why Google makes the Pixel hardware,
[28:25.300 --> 28:28.140]  I feel like Microsoft makes the Surface stuff
[28:28.140 --> 28:30.740]  as to at least have one set of,
[28:30.740 --> 28:33.380]  here's high quality hardware with Windows
[28:33.380 --> 28:36.420]  as we meant it to be used by the user.
[28:36.420 --> 28:39.940]  Yep, that was definitely a part of it.
[28:39.940 --> 28:41.780]  And not having the crapware on it,
[28:41.780 --> 28:43.020]  and also just the little stuff,
[28:43.020 --> 28:45.020]  like I mentioned the trackpad thing,
[28:45.020 --> 28:49.140]  like the, just all this small stuff works right.
[28:49.140 --> 28:50.340]  And there's attention to detail
[28:50.340 --> 28:52.060]  like throughout the machine.
[28:52.060 --> 28:53.740]  And for sure that was a motivation.
[28:53.740 --> 28:56.460]  The reason why I've always been a big critic
[28:56.460 --> 28:59.660]  of Surface generally, it's a very sort of like,
[28:59.660 --> 29:02.660]  it's just because the origin of Surface,
[29:02.660 --> 29:04.100]  and this is something I wrote this week.
[29:04.100 --> 29:06.940]  I mean, you know, it's actually not a delegate there.
[29:06.940 --> 29:09.060]  The reason we started Surface seven years ago,
[29:09.060 --> 29:13.740]  and it was all total BS, because I was there at the time.
[29:13.740 --> 29:15.980]  And so in the day that I went back
[29:15.980 --> 29:18.860]  and linked to Steve Ballmer's presentation,
[29:18.860 --> 29:21.460]  which was, there was all about Windows, Windows, Windows.
[29:21.460 --> 29:24.180]  And Surface was a manifestation of Windows
[29:24.180 --> 29:26.660]  and Windows was the center of Microsoft, et cetera, et cetera.
[29:26.660 --> 29:29.380]  And that part of Microsoft needed to die.
[29:29.380 --> 29:32.740]  Like it needed to not be a company about Windows.
[29:32.740 --> 29:35.540]  And so that was why I was always against the Surface
[29:35.540 --> 29:37.860]  because in my mind Surface existed
[29:37.860 --> 29:39.980]  because it was meant to be a physical manifestation
[29:39.980 --> 29:42.700]  of Windows and anything Windows related needed to die.
[29:42.700 --> 29:46.620]  And now I'm like, you know, well, the Surface,
[29:46.620 --> 29:47.860]  honestly, it's not that big a deal.
[29:47.860 --> 29:49.140]  It's $6 billion in revenue.
[29:49.140 --> 29:51.020]  Microsoft did what, 120 billion last year
[29:51.020 --> 29:52.020]  or something like that.
[29:52.020 --> 29:53.860]  And you know, the margins are much smaller
[29:53.860 --> 29:55.580]  than the rest of the company.
[29:55.580 --> 29:58.580]  But you know what, Satya Nadella killed Windows.
[29:58.580 --> 30:00.740]  Like he, it's one of the most incredible
[30:00.740 --> 30:03.940]  sort of corporate change jobs ever,
[30:03.940 --> 30:06.620]  the way he like really transformed the culture there.
[30:06.620 --> 30:07.580]  And so, you know what,
[30:07.580 --> 30:08.940]  if they want to mess around making hardware
[30:08.940 --> 30:10.660]  and very good hardware at that,
[30:10.660 --> 30:12.620]  and frankly, you know, from what I can see,
[30:12.620 --> 30:13.900]  they seem to be pretty popular.
[30:13.900 --> 30:17.620]  I mean, you see, you know, I see them around a fair bit,
[30:17.620 --> 30:19.860]  probably more than the other PCIC.
[30:19.860 --> 30:20.700]  That's fine.
[30:20.700 --> 30:24.580]  It's fine because like the reason I worried
[30:24.580 --> 30:27.420]  about Surface's existence is gone
[30:27.420 --> 30:28.900]  and all those other reasons,
[30:28.900 --> 30:31.460]  like we want to actually have nice PCs
[30:31.460 --> 30:33.220]  and we don't want to have a bunch of crap where on it
[30:33.220 --> 30:34.820]  and we want to sort of have more control
[30:34.820 --> 30:37.460]  and hey, we'll take that extra bit of margin
[30:37.460 --> 30:38.700]  if we sell into the corporate place
[30:38.700 --> 30:40.780]  where we get the hardware margin and the software margin.
[30:40.780 --> 30:41.620]  That's fine.
[30:41.620 --> 30:42.700]  It's great.
[30:42.700 --> 30:43.820]  I'm glad they're doing it.
[30:43.820 --> 30:45.660]  And you know what?
[30:45.660 --> 30:47.540]  I'm glad someone is up there making fun of Apple
[30:47.540 --> 30:48.740]  for having shit keyboards
[30:48.740 --> 30:49.900]  because heaven knows Apple deserves it.
[30:49.900 --> 30:51.460]  So good for them.
[30:51.460 --> 30:53.540]  Yeah, and it's sort of like,
[30:53.540 --> 30:58.540]  in a way, you're right that what Nadella has done
[30:59.180 --> 31:01.900]  is truly extraordinary because,
[31:01.900 --> 31:05.100]  and I think if you want to boil down
[31:05.100 --> 31:08.780]  what was the reason for showing Balmer the door
[31:08.780 --> 31:12.140]  and switching, you know, putting Nadella in,
[31:12.140 --> 31:15.420]  I mean, clearly there were several strategic shifts
[31:15.420 --> 31:16.860]  that Nadella introduced,
[31:16.860 --> 31:21.780]  but I think if you really want to boil it down to a nut,
[31:21.780 --> 31:23.700]  it was weird.
[31:23.700 --> 31:25.860]  It's no longer Windows first.
[31:25.860 --> 31:26.700]  That's right.
[31:26.700 --> 31:28.020]  That's absolutely right.
[31:28.020 --> 31:28.860]  And it's, you know,
[31:28.860 --> 31:31.500]  it's not like Windows has been put in the ash heap.
[31:31.500 --> 31:32.340]  They still-
[31:32.340 --> 31:34.580]  No, they still make a lot of money off of Windows, right?
[31:34.580 --> 31:35.420]  Which is fine,
[31:35.420 --> 31:39.500]  but it's not the driving force of the company like it was.
[31:39.500 --> 31:41.420]  No, but in another sense,
[31:41.420 --> 31:43.900]  by focusing on what was important,
[31:43.900 --> 31:46.460]  like Office productivity apps
[31:46.460 --> 31:50.100]  and the Azure stuff is certainly very important to them too.
[31:50.100 --> 31:52.380]  The cloud stuff is very successful.
[31:54.020 --> 31:55.580]  But like with the Office stuff,
[31:55.580 --> 31:58.220]  in a sense, the strategy hasn't changed at all.
[31:58.220 --> 32:01.260]  The idea, the old idea was we'll have Windows everywhere
[32:01.260 --> 32:04.100]  and therefore we'll be able to have our apps everywhere.
[32:04.100 --> 32:05.620]  Well, their apps are still everywhere
[32:05.620 --> 32:07.580]  and it's, in fact, there are more places
[32:07.580 --> 32:10.140]  because now they're, you know,
[32:10.140 --> 32:11.460]  I think when Balmer was still there,
[32:11.460 --> 32:15.060]  they were still sort of sitting on iPad apps
[32:15.060 --> 32:17.940]  for Office that they had, that were like ready.
[32:17.940 --> 32:20.300]  That's right, they were built under Balmer,
[32:20.300 --> 32:21.380]  but he wouldn't release them
[32:21.380 --> 32:22.940]  until the Windows version was ready.
[32:22.940 --> 32:24.300]  And so when Nadella came in,
[32:24.300 --> 32:26.900]  the first presentation he did
[32:26.900 --> 32:29.100]  is about a month in, two months in,
[32:29.100 --> 32:31.660]  was unveil Office for iPad.
[32:31.660 --> 32:35.380]  And it was, and yes, they were built under Balmer
[32:35.380 --> 32:37.380]  and maybe by the end Balmer said,
[32:37.380 --> 32:39.140]  okay, fine, I'll let this sit until you come out.
[32:39.140 --> 32:41.180]  I mean, who knows what the mechanics were,
[32:41.180 --> 32:43.940]  but it was such a perfect sort of like coming out party
[32:43.940 --> 32:45.780]  for Nadella to be like,
[32:45.780 --> 32:47.900]  no, like Windows doesn't call the shots anymore.
[32:47.900 --> 32:50.500]  Right, and you know, it was an important way of saying,
[32:50.500 --> 32:52.940]  it was symbolic, right?
[32:52.940 --> 32:53.980]  And it was sort of like.
[32:53.980 --> 32:54.820]  Exactly.
[32:57.220 --> 32:58.460]  And Steve Jobs did the same thing
[32:58.460 --> 33:00.580]  when he came back to Apple in 1997.
[33:00.580 --> 33:01.940]  Well, that's such a great analogy.
[33:01.940 --> 33:02.940]  I wish I would have made that before.
[33:02.940 --> 33:04.660]  You're right, it's the exact same thing.
[33:04.660 --> 33:06.580]  It's the exact same thing.
[33:06.580 --> 33:10.140]  What Jobs did was launch the Think Different ad campaign.
[33:10.140 --> 33:12.660]  And because it was, he wanted to say,
[33:12.660 --> 33:14.980]  he wanted something out the door that said,
[33:14.980 --> 33:17.300]  hey, Apple is different now.
[33:17.300 --> 33:19.340]  There's a new team in town.
[33:19.340 --> 33:22.580]  And a product takes too long, right?
[33:22.580 --> 33:25.980]  Because Jobs and the next crew came in
[33:25.980 --> 33:29.020]  and they had years of work ahead of them.
[33:29.020 --> 33:30.460]  They underestimated it, of course,
[33:30.460 --> 33:31.500]  because everybody underestimates
[33:31.500 --> 33:32.540]  how long software is gonna take.
[33:32.540 --> 33:35.940]  But what we now know is Mac OS X didn't come out till 2001.
[33:35.940 --> 33:37.860]  It was four years ahead.
[33:37.860 --> 33:39.740]  Yeah, and it wasn't really usable until like 2003.
[33:39.740 --> 33:42.940]  Yeah, and the iMac is the more important thing.
[33:42.940 --> 33:45.500]  But the iMac, they had to start from scratch
[33:45.500 --> 33:47.460]  when Jobs came in and realized
[33:47.460 --> 33:49.260]  that there was this guy named Johnny Ive
[33:49.260 --> 33:50.940]  and a great industrial design team.
[33:50.940 --> 33:54.500]  And they got working on it very soon,
[33:54.500 --> 33:55.380]  but they still had to wait for it.
[33:55.380 --> 33:57.140]  So what could they get out the door quickly?
[33:57.140 --> 33:58.340]  An ad campaign.
[33:58.340 --> 34:03.220]  Well, Nadella, luckily enough, had these iPad apps there,
[34:03.220 --> 34:05.900]  ready, just polish them up, let's get them out
[34:05.900 --> 34:07.340]  and it'll tell the world,
[34:07.340 --> 34:10.140]  hey, there's a new team running Microsoft.
[34:10.140 --> 34:11.220]  We have a new strategy.
[34:11.220 --> 34:14.660]  But if anything, the let's put our Office apps everywhere
[34:14.660 --> 34:18.620]  strategy, everywhere includes more places now
[34:18.620 --> 34:20.620]  than when it was Windows, Windows, Windows,
[34:20.620 --> 34:23.820]  because they're still first class apps on Windows,
[34:23.820 --> 34:25.500]  of course, but now they're everywhere.
[34:25.500 --> 34:26.740]  They're on Android,
[34:26.740 --> 34:29.460]  which we'll have more to talk about in a moment,
[34:29.460 --> 34:32.580]  iOS, and of course, the Mac still.
[34:33.780 --> 34:35.860]  If anything, it's more strategic.
[34:35.860 --> 34:37.700]  It's almost impossible to buy a computer today
[34:37.700 --> 34:40.260]  where you can't run MS Office.
[34:40.260 --> 34:42.140]  Well, actually, I thought that what you're gonna go back to
[34:42.140 --> 34:43.180]  is not the campaign.
[34:43.180 --> 34:46.380]  I thought you're gonna go back to the Macworld Boston
[34:46.380 --> 34:48.980]  where Bill Gates appears on the screen
[34:48.980 --> 34:50.220]  and Steve Jobs is up there saying,
[34:50.220 --> 34:53.260]  look, we can't be fighting this battle anymore.
[34:53.260 --> 34:55.540]  Like we gotta move on.
[34:55.540 --> 34:59.020]  And to me, that's an even better comparison to this
[34:59.020 --> 35:02.100]  because it's quite literally embracing your competitor.
[35:02.100 --> 35:03.260]  And that's what Nadella did.
[35:03.260 --> 35:04.100]  Yeah, you're right.
[35:04.100 --> 35:07.100]  Like the Ballmer, he was fortunate enough
[35:07.100 --> 35:09.020]  that the product had already been built.
[35:09.020 --> 35:10.620]  So all he had to do was release it.
[35:10.620 --> 35:12.060]  And that was even more powerful
[35:12.060 --> 35:15.420]  than putting someone on screen or something on those lines.
[35:15.420 --> 35:20.420]  But I think the idea and like the impact that has,
[35:20.580 --> 35:22.020]  not just on the outside world,
[35:22.020 --> 35:24.500]  but on like your own employees and your own company.
[35:24.500 --> 35:28.300]  And it's like, shit, Steve Jobs is on stage with Bill Gates.
[35:28.300 --> 35:30.940]  And now it's like, oh, it's actually Nadella's first act,
[35:30.940 --> 35:34.140]  our new CO's first act is to walk around
[35:34.140 --> 35:35.620]  with an iPad in his hand.
[35:35.620 --> 35:36.460]  Yeah, that's a good one too.
[35:36.460 --> 35:40.060]  I mean, it was, you know, they're all of the same mentality
[35:40.060 --> 35:43.540]  that let's show how different we are.
[35:43.540 --> 35:45.340]  And you're right, you know,
[35:45.340 --> 35:46.860]  I would say the Think Different campaign
[35:46.860 --> 35:49.060]  was the one that was first out the door, but less important.
[35:49.060 --> 35:52.420]  More important was that Macworld New York keynote
[35:52.420 --> 35:55.780]  where they buried the hatchet.
[35:55.780 --> 36:00.140]  I think that very close to an accurate quote
[36:00.140 --> 36:02.940]  without Googling it is we have to let go,
[36:02.940 --> 36:03.780]  this is Steve Jobs,
[36:03.780 --> 36:07.060]  we have to let go of the idea that for Apple to win,
[36:07.060 --> 36:08.660]  Microsoft has to lose.
[36:08.660 --> 36:09.980]  You have to let go of it.
[36:09.980 --> 36:12.020]  And, you know, and it did not go over well.
[36:12.020 --> 36:13.420]  There were like, I don't think he got booed.
[36:13.420 --> 36:14.580]  No, I think there was boos.
[36:14.580 --> 36:19.580]  I think there were some boos and it was just like,
[36:20.900 --> 36:22.780]  whatever the sound,
[36:22.780 --> 36:27.460]  the collective sound of an audience going, what the fuck?
[36:28.500 --> 36:31.020]  That's the noise that was in the audience.
[36:31.020 --> 36:34.020]  You know, there were some scattered boos
[36:34.020 --> 36:36.460]  because there are a lot of Apple fans at the time
[36:36.460 --> 36:40.460]  who really did see this as a holy war
[36:41.340 --> 36:42.740]  and Jobs was exactly right.
[36:42.740 --> 36:44.740]  You know, and like I often say about Apple,
[36:44.740 --> 36:48.300]  you know, they're more often than not
[36:48.300 --> 36:49.180]  when they tell you something,
[36:49.180 --> 36:50.940]  they mean exactly what they say.
[36:50.940 --> 36:53.580]  And what he said, it wasn't like subterfuge.
[36:53.580 --> 36:55.940]  It wasn't, yeah, I'm just gonna say
[36:55.940 --> 36:58.180]  that we're burying the hatchet with Microsoft,
[36:58.180 --> 37:00.260]  but I've got a secret plan where we're gonna kill him.
[37:00.260 --> 37:01.100]  No, he meant it.
[37:01.100 --> 37:03.260]  He meant every single word that he said.
[37:03.260 --> 37:04.100]  Yep, absolutely.
[37:04.100 --> 37:05.940]  And look at the years,
[37:05.940 --> 37:07.180]  look at the success that they had
[37:07.180 --> 37:09.140]  by letting go of that notion.
[37:09.140 --> 37:09.980]  And then what he said,
[37:09.980 --> 37:12.220]  actually, I wrote about this a while ago,
[37:12.220 --> 37:14.140]  so I actually was able to find the speech
[37:14.140 --> 37:15.620]  and you said it almost perfectly.
[37:15.620 --> 37:16.500]  We have to let go of the notion
[37:16.500 --> 37:18.620]  that for Apple to win, Microsoft has to lose.
[37:18.620 --> 37:20.620]  And then his next line I think is just as good,
[37:20.620 --> 37:23.300]  which is he says, we have to embrace a notion
[37:23.300 --> 37:26.380]  that for Apple to win, Apple has to do a really good job.
[37:26.380 --> 37:31.380]  And there's something very refreshing about that
[37:31.620 --> 37:32.940]  because the fact of the matter is
[37:32.940 --> 37:35.380]  most of Apple's products then were kind of crappy.
[37:35.380 --> 37:38.740]  And certainly the operating system was a total mess.
[37:38.740 --> 37:40.780]  And we've talked about this before.
[37:40.780 --> 37:44.780]  And it's liberating in a way.
[37:44.780 --> 37:45.740]  It's like, you know what?
[37:45.740 --> 37:48.900]  We just need to do what we're good at and we will succeed.
[37:48.900 --> 37:50.220]  And I think it was the same thing with Microsoft.
[37:50.220 --> 37:53.620]  Like they were fighting this losing battle
[37:53.620 --> 37:57.380]  to try to prop Windows up and what they needed to do
[37:57.380 --> 37:59.820]  was take their assets that were still valuable,
[37:59.820 --> 38:01.380]  that were still effective,
[38:01.380 --> 38:03.220]  and the new assets that we're bringing online
[38:03.220 --> 38:04.580]  in terms of Azure and whatnot,
[38:04.580 --> 38:06.860]  and let them win by being good.
[38:06.860 --> 38:10.340]  Don't let them win by being tied to Windows,
[38:10.340 --> 38:11.540]  let them win on their own merits.
[38:11.540 --> 38:13.380]  And that's exactly what they've done.
[38:15.180 --> 38:16.500]  I'm not particularly interested
[38:16.500 --> 38:18.540]  in Microsoft's latest products
[38:18.540 --> 38:19.620]  because I'm not gonna use Windows,
[38:19.620 --> 38:20.460]  but I'm glad they're there.
[38:20.460 --> 38:22.420]  But I get confused by the names.
[38:22.420 --> 38:24.220]  The one that I like is I like the one called
[38:24.220 --> 38:27.540]  the Surface Laptop because I know which one it is.
[38:27.540 --> 38:28.700]  It's the laptop.
[38:30.220 --> 38:34.340]  They also have the Surface Pro X, I guess.
[38:34.340 --> 38:35.380]  So this is confusing.
[38:35.380 --> 38:37.660]  So I will explain it.
[38:37.660 --> 38:41.980]  The Surface Pro is a regular x86 PC.
[38:41.980 --> 38:46.300]  The Surface Pro X is an ARM PC, is ARM-based.
[38:46.300 --> 38:50.420]  So, but yeah, it is a little confusing.
[38:50.420 --> 38:52.060]  And it looks like great hardware.
[38:52.060 --> 38:53.620]  I mean, it's basically an iPad.
[38:53.620 --> 38:55.340]  Yeah, or an iPad Pro.
[38:55.340 --> 38:56.620]  I would say it's iPad Pro class
[38:56.620 --> 38:59.180]  because it starts at $1,000.
[38:59.180 --> 39:00.660]  Yep, and it's got the keyboard attachment
[39:00.660 --> 39:03.860]  as the cool, like the stylus goes into the keyboard,
[39:03.860 --> 39:04.940]  which is really nifty.
[39:04.940 --> 39:08.060]  So you don't have like a separate thing floating around.
[39:09.100 --> 39:12.300]  But yeah, so, and then they have the,
[39:13.380 --> 39:15.740]  that stuff, they have the earbuds,
[39:15.740 --> 39:17.620]  you know, as I cook on Twitter.
[39:17.620 --> 39:20.660]  Are you a tech company if you don't sell earbuds?
[39:20.660 --> 39:23.740]  And then obviously the dual screen devices
[39:23.740 --> 39:24.580]  that I'm not gonna watch for a while.
[39:24.580 --> 39:25.420]  The earbuds was the,
[39:25.420 --> 39:27.700]  I was on my way to a meeting at the time.
[39:27.700 --> 39:29.820]  And so the earbuds,
[39:30.740 --> 39:33.380]  which is a very strange thing for me to say,
[39:33.380 --> 39:34.500]  I don't really have a lot of meetings,
[39:34.500 --> 39:37.220]  but I was on my way to a meeting in New York
[39:37.220 --> 39:42.220]  and I was watching the Microsoft event on my phone
[39:43.220 --> 39:46.780]  with my AirPods as I was getting ready to go to the subway.
[39:46.780 --> 39:50.660]  And I knew I'd lose the stream on the subway.
[39:50.660 --> 39:52.740]  And the earbuds was the last segment I saw.
[39:52.740 --> 39:55.660]  And I just had to laugh because their pitch
[39:55.660 --> 39:57.500]  for the earbuds was entirely based
[39:57.500 --> 39:59.260]  on integration with Office.
[39:59.260 --> 40:01.900]  I know, it was pretty funny.
[40:01.900 --> 40:04.060]  Which I laugh, you know,
[40:04.060 --> 40:06.780]  but maybe they know their audience, you know, like,
[40:06.780 --> 40:08.340]  but it was like, how did-
[40:08.340 --> 40:09.180]  You know what though?
[40:09.180 --> 40:11.380]  I'll tell you why I didn't mind.
[40:11.380 --> 40:14.620]  I mean, it was a little, I mean, it was kind of silly.
[40:14.620 --> 40:15.700]  Like who buys earbuds
[40:15.700 --> 40:17.100]  because they work with your favorite
[40:17.100 --> 40:18.420]  Office productivity suite
[40:18.420 --> 40:22.060]  and favorite probably deserves some air quotes around that.
[40:22.060 --> 40:24.700]  But you know what it was?
[40:24.700 --> 40:28.500]  It was, that's a Microsoft with his head screwed on straight.
[40:28.500 --> 40:29.340]  You know what I mean?
[40:29.340 --> 40:31.340]  Like, yeah, at the end of the day in a vacuum,
[40:31.340 --> 40:34.020]  it's ridiculous that you're going to try to sell AirPods
[40:34.020 --> 40:35.420]  because they work with Office.
[40:35.420 --> 40:38.700]  But if you zoom out, like that's emblematic of a Microsoft
[40:38.700 --> 40:40.140]  that knows where their bread is buttered.
[40:40.140 --> 40:43.060]  Like what matters is actually Office and Azure.
[40:43.060 --> 40:46.940]  And that's, you know, the cool part of the AirPods,
[40:46.940 --> 40:47.820]  whatever they're called,
[40:47.820 --> 40:49.340]  is that they do integrate with Azure
[40:49.340 --> 40:50.580]  and they do this live captioning
[40:50.580 --> 40:52.380]  and live translation and stuff like that.
[40:52.380 --> 40:53.620]  Basically what Google promised
[40:53.620 --> 40:55.220]  with their Google buds last year,
[40:55.220 --> 40:56.980]  but it didn't really work very well.
[40:56.980 --> 40:59.420]  It certainly appeared to work much better
[40:59.420 --> 41:01.020]  with what Microsoft demonstrated.
[41:01.020 --> 41:02.980]  We'll see, you know, once they actually come out.
[41:02.980 --> 41:05.300]  And so it's a product that ties in with Office
[41:05.300 --> 41:06.140]  and ties in with Azure.
[41:06.140 --> 41:07.700]  And like, that's like,
[41:07.700 --> 41:10.740]  maybe that's kind of silly for the product in a vacuum,
[41:10.740 --> 41:12.580]  but for what that says about Microsoft,
[41:12.580 --> 41:14.660]  like at least their head's in the right place.
[41:14.660 --> 41:15.860]  I thought it was interesting too.
[41:15.860 --> 41:18.500]  I enjoyed watching the event and I thought that,
[41:19.540 --> 41:21.980]  I feel like Microsoft has this down
[41:21.980 --> 41:24.100]  and I feel like they do their events like this
[41:24.100 --> 41:25.260]  the right way for them.
[41:25.260 --> 41:28.700]  I mean, they're clearly smaller and lower key than Apple's.
[41:28.700 --> 41:32.780]  You know, they're not in a big, huge room.
[41:32.780 --> 41:35.340]  It is, they are definitely press events.
[41:35.340 --> 41:37.180]  Like the one thing, like Nilay and I were talking about.
[41:37.180 --> 41:38.580]  It seemed quite small, yeah.
[41:38.580 --> 41:41.220]  Is that Apple, the one thing like that,
[41:41.220 --> 41:42.580]  not to go too far digressed,
[41:42.580 --> 41:45.620]  but like the Charlie Worzel column in the New York Times,
[41:45.620 --> 41:49.100]  goofily arguing that Apple should stop doing events.
[41:49.100 --> 41:51.340]  One of the misguided premises of that
[41:51.340 --> 41:53.700]  was that Apple's events are press events,
[41:53.700 --> 41:54.740]  that they're media events.
[41:54.740 --> 41:57.100]  They are not, they are Apple events
[41:57.100 --> 42:00.660]  and they happen to invite a small number of media
[42:00.660 --> 42:01.740]  to observe them.
[42:02.700 --> 42:05.860]  Whereas Microsoft's thing this week was a press event.
[42:05.860 --> 42:07.180]  That was for the press
[42:07.180 --> 42:09.060]  and most of the people there were pressed.
[42:09.060 --> 42:10.900]  But anyway, one of the things that I saw
[42:10.900 --> 42:13.700]  that struck me was how different their demos are
[42:13.700 --> 42:15.260]  than Apple's demos.
[42:15.260 --> 42:20.260]  Apple's demos are very short, very flashy, very visual
[42:20.540 --> 42:21.620]  and everything is set up.
[42:21.620 --> 42:24.380]  And it's like, if they want to show you
[42:24.380 --> 42:26.420]  the new side-by-side stuff in the iPad,
[42:26.420 --> 42:31.420]  it's like here's this pretty webpage with beautiful pictures
[42:31.500 --> 42:35.340]  and here's a note that already has a couple of nice pictures
[42:35.340 --> 42:37.660]  and here's a, we're gonna drag this beautiful picture
[42:37.660 --> 42:39.540]  from the left to the right and let it go.
[42:39.540 --> 42:41.460]  And look at that, you can drag a picture
[42:41.460 --> 42:43.260]  and then it's onto the next thing, right?
[42:43.260 --> 42:45.260]  Like the demo's over, all they showed you
[42:45.260 --> 42:47.620]  was a beautiful photo being dragged
[42:47.620 --> 42:49.980]  from an app on the left to an app on the right.
[42:49.980 --> 42:51.220]  Whereas the Microsoft demos,
[42:51.220 --> 42:53.180]  it's like you get to spend like four minutes
[42:53.180 --> 42:55.260]  watching somebody work in Excel.
[42:55.260 --> 42:56.100]  Right?
[42:58.100 --> 42:59.580]  Actually that was,
[42:59.580 --> 43:01.580]  that was actually where the low key coolest demos
[43:01.580 --> 43:03.660]  was when they were writing in Excel
[43:03.660 --> 43:05.540]  and then it was changing it into actual text
[43:05.540 --> 43:07.060]  as they were doing it.
[43:07.060 --> 43:08.420]  But yeah, but it's like,
[43:08.420 --> 43:12.540]  you are literally watching someone literally write in Excel.
[43:12.540 --> 43:13.820]  It is exactly like,
[43:13.820 --> 43:17.180]  like if you work in a lowercase O office environment
[43:17.180 --> 43:19.860]  and you like pop into somebody's cubicle
[43:19.860 --> 43:21.060]  and you're just like, hey, what are you doing?
[43:21.060 --> 43:22.780]  You're just like watching them over their shoulder
[43:22.780 --> 43:24.820]  for a couple of minutes while they, you know,
[43:24.820 --> 43:27.380]  put together a spreadsheet or a presentation.
[43:27.380 --> 43:30.140]  And again, I laugh, I laugh only because it's different.
[43:30.140 --> 43:31.340]  I'm not saying that that's wrong.
[43:31.340 --> 43:32.700]  I think that they know their audience
[43:32.700 --> 43:36.140]  and it's probably the appropriate type of demo
[43:36.140 --> 43:38.740]  for the audience and for the message they have.
[43:38.740 --> 43:40.740]  But it is kind of comical because it really,
[43:40.740 --> 43:42.700]  it couldn't be more different than apples.
[43:42.700 --> 43:46.780]  And apples is, if anything, gone further over the years
[43:46.780 --> 43:50.780]  into not that it's unrealistic, but that it is really more,
[43:50.780 --> 43:52.300]  it's almost edited, you know,
[43:52.300 --> 43:55.300]  it's like they have the whole thing ready to go.
[43:57.100 --> 43:59.380]  And even watching them do it live on stage
[43:59.380 --> 44:01.060]  isn't that different than what you would see
[44:01.060 --> 44:02.860]  if they cut it into a 30 second commercial
[44:02.860 --> 44:04.540]  to show you how it works.
[44:04.540 --> 44:06.380]  Yep.
[44:06.380 --> 44:09.060]  So the ear, I think they're just called earbuds?
[44:09.060 --> 44:10.180]  Surface earbuds?
[44:11.180 --> 44:12.020]  I don't know.
[44:12.020 --> 44:12.860]  Yeah, surface earbuds.
[44:14.620 --> 44:17.460]  And before I cracked wise about them,
[44:17.460 --> 44:20.860]  I wanted to make sure, check my bias.
[44:20.860 --> 44:23.780]  I showed them to my wife and I said,
[44:23.780 --> 44:26.060]  hey, do these look goofy?
[44:26.060 --> 44:28.740]  And she goes, they look like an Apple Watch charger
[44:28.740 --> 44:32.780]  or those spacers that people put in their earlobes.
[44:32.780 --> 44:33.900]  Yes, that's what I thought of.
[44:33.900 --> 44:36.940]  The spacers and the earlobes is exactly what I thought of.
[44:36.940 --> 44:39.340]  So I didn't want to make, I thought of that too,
[44:39.340 --> 44:42.100]  and I didn't want to make fun of that.
[44:42.100 --> 44:44.820]  I felt like, you know, that paints me, you know,
[44:44.820 --> 44:46.540]  if you want to have spacers in your earlobes,
[44:46.540 --> 44:47.540]  you have spacers in your earlobe.
[44:47.540 --> 44:49.740]  So I didn't want to make fun of that.
[44:49.740 --> 44:51.940]  So I thought that the Apple Watch charger joke
[44:51.940 --> 44:53.580]  was the way to go, so I used it.
[44:53.580 --> 44:56.380]  And then like later in the day, it's nice to know,
[44:56.380 --> 44:58.180]  see, she thought she was getting a dig in on me.
[44:58.180 --> 45:01.100]  She says, huh, I see I'm writing for Daring Fireball now.
[45:01.100 --> 45:05.180]  Because I used her joke, but secretly pleased me
[45:05.180 --> 45:08.540]  because she often claims not to read my website.
[45:08.540 --> 45:10.020]  And I know that she does.
[45:10.020 --> 45:10.860]  There you go.
[45:12.020 --> 45:13.060]  Are we going to talk about charcoal
[45:13.060 --> 45:14.300]  at some point in this podcast?
[45:14.300 --> 45:15.620]  That's the real question.
[45:16.500 --> 45:17.740]  Well, we might as well.
[45:19.180 --> 45:20.940]  Yeah, we could talk about charcoal.
[45:22.780 --> 45:24.940]  All right, hold on, let me just say that for the end.
[45:24.940 --> 45:27.300]  We still got to talk about the dual screen devices,
[45:27.300 --> 45:29.540]  but we could save the charcoal for the end.
[45:29.540 --> 45:31.180]  All right, let me make a note
[45:31.180 --> 45:33.060]  that we'll get back to charcoal.
[45:33.060 --> 45:34.260]  Do you need any charcoal?
[45:36.780 --> 45:38.420]  Do I have a choice in the matter?
[45:38.420 --> 45:39.980]  No, it's on its way, actually.
[45:41.540 --> 45:42.380]  Let me take a break though.
[45:42.380 --> 45:45.340]  I thank our next sponsor, ExpressVPN.
[45:46.860 --> 45:48.380]  You ever use public wifi?
[45:48.380 --> 45:49.660]  You ever get to the airport,
[45:49.660 --> 45:51.660]  get on the old public wifi in there
[45:51.660 --> 45:53.740]  because your self connection is dead
[45:53.740 --> 45:54.780]  at the end of the terminal,
[45:54.780 --> 45:59.780]  but they've got SFO public wifi or whatever
[45:59.860 --> 46:01.100]  in a coffee shop maybe.
[46:01.100 --> 46:02.500]  Maybe it's because you're on a Mac.
[46:02.500 --> 46:04.780]  You don't have, you're not ready to tether
[46:04.780 --> 46:06.100]  or something like that.
[46:06.100 --> 46:07.580]  Hey, we've all been there.
[46:07.580 --> 46:09.500]  Maybe it's a hotel, something like that.
[46:09.500 --> 46:10.340]  Well, guess what?
[46:10.340 --> 46:11.180]  It's not really secure.
[46:11.180 --> 46:12.420]  In fact, it's kind of unsecure.
[46:12.420 --> 46:13.260]  And you ever get on there?
[46:13.260 --> 46:15.260]  You ever get on, like you're on the airplane,
[46:15.260 --> 46:16.100]  you get on the wifi,
[46:16.100 --> 46:17.660]  there's a situation where you have to.
[46:17.660 --> 46:18.940]  And all of a sudden you look at AirDrop
[46:18.940 --> 46:21.980]  and there's like 14 people in your AirDrop
[46:21.980 --> 46:25.500]  because everybody is on the same wifi network.
[46:25.500 --> 46:26.340]  Well, guess what?
[46:26.340 --> 46:29.980]  You can use to get on an insecure network,
[46:29.980 --> 46:31.900]  but have a secure connection to the internet.
[46:31.900 --> 46:34.780]  What you need is a VPN, a virtual private network.
[46:36.300 --> 46:39.500]  ExpressVPN secures and anonymizes your internet browsing
[46:39.500 --> 46:42.380]  by encrypting your data and hiding your public IP address.
[46:42.380 --> 46:44.980]  So the website you visit won't even know your IP address.
[46:44.980 --> 46:47.660]  So it's not just security, it's also privacy.
[46:47.660 --> 46:50.140]  Very, very important to have that distinction
[46:50.140 --> 46:52.180]  to know that it gives you both.
[46:52.180 --> 46:54.260]  They've got easy to use apps that run seamlessly
[46:54.260 --> 46:56.700]  in the background of your computer, phone and tablet
[46:56.700 --> 47:01.340]  and turning on ExpressVPN protection only takes one click.
[47:01.340 --> 47:02.380]  That's important too,
[47:02.380 --> 47:03.460]  because I know what you might be thinking.
[47:03.460 --> 47:05.060]  You might be thinking, this sounds good.
[47:05.060 --> 47:06.780]  I kind of heard of VPNs.
[47:07.740 --> 47:08.860]  I don't really know how they work.
[47:08.860 --> 47:10.180]  I just know it'd be better if I have one,
[47:10.180 --> 47:12.020]  but I don't know how the hell to set it up.
[47:12.020 --> 47:12.860]  What do I do?
[47:12.860 --> 47:13.780]  Is it like a 13 step process?
[47:13.780 --> 47:16.780]  No, you install the app, one click.
[47:16.780 --> 47:17.620]  There you go.

[47:52.740 --> 47:55.980]  And you can get three months free with a one year package.
[47:55.980 --> 47:58.420]  My thanks to ExpressVPN for sponsoring the show.
[48:01.500 --> 48:02.820]  So the other thing,
[48:02.820 --> 48:05.820]  the thing that stole the show at Microsoft's event,
[48:05.820 --> 48:07.780]  it closed the show with two products.
[48:07.780 --> 48:09.620]  They had two more things,
[48:09.620 --> 48:14.620]  the Surface Duo and the Surface Neo,
[48:15.980 --> 48:18.700]  which again, I've already forgotten which one's which.
[48:19.620 --> 48:21.540]  I know, I was just thinking the same thing.
[48:21.540 --> 48:25.180]  I think the Neo is the tablet slash courier one,
[48:25.180 --> 48:27.900]  the Duo is the phone, but I'm not certain.
[48:27.900 --> 48:29.180]  Oh no, I think it's the other way around.
[48:29.180 --> 48:30.420]  Just son of a bitch.
[48:31.780 --> 48:32.620]  God damn it.
[48:34.700 --> 48:35.540]  Yup, no, I'm right.
[48:35.540 --> 48:36.980]  Duo is the phone.
[48:36.980 --> 48:39.740]  Duo is the Android and Neo is the Windows device.
[48:39.740 --> 48:44.420]  See, I was thinking Neo is an N and Android has an N,
[48:44.420 --> 48:46.060]  but that's wrong.
[48:47.420 --> 48:48.580]  Oh man.
[48:48.580 --> 48:51.740]  All right, so Duo is the phone.
[48:51.740 --> 48:53.500]  I don't know how I'm gonna remember this,
[48:53.500 --> 48:55.220]  but anyway, it's a phone.
[48:55.220 --> 48:58.380]  And I thought Lauren Goode, she had wired,
[48:58.380 --> 49:00.660]  she had a preview.
[49:00.660 --> 49:03.260]  She got to, I guess, talk to them a week before,
[49:03.260 --> 49:04.900]  a couple of days before the event
[49:04.900 --> 49:08.060]  and had a feature story and an interview with,
[49:10.580 --> 49:11.420]  what's his name?
[49:11.420 --> 49:12.260]  Panay.
[49:13.340 --> 49:16.660]  Oh, both, both, I'm not sure either.
[49:17.660 --> 49:21.380]  Panos Panay and Satya Nadella, yeah, both of them.
[49:21.380 --> 49:24.340]  Right, and Panos Panay is sort of the,
[49:24.340 --> 49:25.500]  he's the Surface guy.
[49:25.500 --> 49:27.540]  It's like Surface, the whole Surface division
[49:27.540 --> 49:30.040]  is sort of his baby at Microsoft.
[49:31.460 --> 49:34.020]  And she had a great story and she's like,
[49:34.020 --> 49:35.740]  whatever you do, don't call it a phone,
[49:35.740 --> 49:37.980]  even though it's a thing that runs Android
[49:37.980 --> 49:40.660]  and can fit in your pocket and can make phone calls,
[49:40.660 --> 49:42.820]  but don't call it a phone.
[49:42.820 --> 49:44.300]  I mean, there is a remarkable quote in here.
[49:44.300 --> 49:46.020]  I mean, just so we can get to the devices in a moment,
[49:46.020 --> 49:48.260]  but just going back to what we were talking about before,
[49:48.260 --> 49:52.060]  where she asked Adela if they would ever
[49:52.060 --> 49:54.180]  bring back Windows Mobile and they both said no.
[49:54.180 --> 49:56.660]  And he says, quote, the operating system
[49:56.660 --> 49:59.100]  is no longer the most important layer for us.
[49:59.100 --> 50:00.820]  What is most important for us is the app model
[50:00.820 --> 50:02.300]  and the experience, how people are going to write apps,
[50:02.300 --> 50:03.140]  blah, blah, blah, blah.
[50:03.140 --> 50:07.540]  And just to hear, I mean, that's clearly the case,
[50:07.540 --> 50:10.740]  but it's still remarkable to have a Microsoft CEO
[50:10.740 --> 50:13.620]  state, baldly, that the operating system
[50:13.620 --> 50:14.980]  is not important to us.
[50:14.980 --> 50:15.820]  Right.
[50:15.820 --> 50:18.500]  Well, and it goes hand in hand with the fact
[50:18.500 --> 50:20.040]  that they're switching their browser
[50:20.040 --> 50:23.820]  to using the Chromium engine.
[50:25.180 --> 50:26.860]  I think it's called Blink.
[50:26.860 --> 50:31.500]  It's like what WebKit is to Safari, Blink is to Chrome.
[50:31.500 --> 50:34.700]  And that's what Microsoft is now using for their browser,
[50:34.700 --> 50:38.820]  which again, go back to like 1998 and tell somebody that.
[50:38.820 --> 50:40.700]  And especially somebody like me
[50:40.700 --> 50:42.180]  who was doing web development at the time.
[50:42.180 --> 50:46.540]  And it's like, what are you going to tell me next?
[50:46.540 --> 50:48.460]  Donald Trump is the president of the United States?
[50:48.460 --> 50:49.300]  I mean.
[50:49.300 --> 50:50.120]  Oh man.
[50:50.120 --> 50:51.180]  I mean, it's crazy.
[50:51.180 --> 50:53.820]  That's not the way they, what kind of world
[50:53.820 --> 50:56.320]  are you guys living in in 2019?
[50:56.320 --> 50:58.520]  But there we are, but you're right.
[50:58.520 --> 51:01.900]  You know, they're making a phone, but it's not a phone.
[51:02.760 --> 51:03.600]  It folds.
[51:03.600 --> 51:04.440]  It's definitely a phone.
[51:04.440 --> 51:05.680]  It's not coming out for a year.
[51:05.680 --> 51:07.800]  I wanted to see pictures of the damn thing
[51:07.800 --> 51:09.400]  next to other phones,
[51:09.400 --> 51:12.080]  just to get a better idea of how big it is.
[51:12.080 --> 51:15.840]  Like, it's clearly big for a phone, even when folded up.
[51:15.840 --> 51:18.760]  But you know, some people really like these much bigger,
[51:18.760 --> 51:21.880]  you know, much bigger than even the max iPhone phones.
[51:21.880 --> 51:22.980]  Some people like them.
[51:24.400 --> 51:25.440]  It certainly is interesting.
[51:25.440 --> 51:27.580]  It folds, but it's not a folding screen.
[51:27.580 --> 51:30.200]  It is two screens with a seam in between.
[51:30.200 --> 51:31.200]  And then they've got two of them.
[51:31.200 --> 51:32.360]  They've got the phone size one.
[51:32.360 --> 51:35.140]  And then the other one, I guess that's the Neo.
[51:35.140 --> 51:36.800]  So I guess the way I'll remember it
[51:36.800 --> 51:38.960]  is it goes alphabetical order by size.
[51:38.960 --> 51:40.520]  Duo, then Neo.
[51:40.520 --> 51:41.360]  All right.
[51:41.360 --> 51:42.200]  Oh, there you go.
[51:42.200 --> 51:43.020]  All right.
[51:43.020 --> 51:43.860]  And then pro.
[51:43.860 --> 51:46.580]  Then laptop kind of screws it up.
[51:46.580 --> 51:50.400]  Yeah. I mean, I, it's interesting because in some respects,
[51:50.400 --> 51:52.040]  if you want to go with the whole, like,
[51:52.040 --> 51:54.520]  this is all symbolism and none of it really matters,
[51:54.520 --> 51:57.420]  then like, you know, I think as a, you know,
[51:57.420 --> 52:01.720]  Microsoft launching a phone that runs Android
[52:01.720 --> 52:04.160]  is like the tombstone on the windows grave.
[52:04.160 --> 52:07.120]  I mean, it doesn't get any more sort of extreme than that.
[52:07.120 --> 52:08.720]  That noted, I don't know.
[52:08.720 --> 52:10.360]  I kind of wish, like,
[52:10.360 --> 52:13.960]  I thought the Neo was a great sort of one more thing.
[52:13.960 --> 52:17.960]  Microsoft, there's this product called the Courier,
[52:17.960 --> 52:22.480]  this sort of a legendary product that was never released.
[52:22.480 --> 52:23.760]  And everyone was like, oh, it was so amazing.
[52:23.760 --> 52:25.960]  That was this two screen product.
[52:25.960 --> 52:27.760]  And, and you bring this along, it's like, oh,
[52:27.760 --> 52:29.920]  I remember they were going to do that one time.
[52:29.920 --> 52:30.760]  And it's like,
[52:30.760 --> 52:32.820]  it's something new and interesting and innovative.
[52:32.820 --> 52:33.880]  And you can even get the,
[52:33.880 --> 52:35.800]  I can understand where you're saying this, you know,
[52:35.800 --> 52:36.960]  announcing this a year early,
[52:36.960 --> 52:38.160]  cause you want to rewrite,
[52:38.160 --> 52:40.820]  we want developers to write programs for two screens
[52:40.820 --> 52:42.760]  and stuff on those lines.
[52:42.760 --> 52:44.200]  And I thought that was fine.
[52:44.200 --> 52:47.400]  Like the phone, it's like, I mean, I guess I,
[52:47.400 --> 52:49.080]  I guess I get it.
[52:49.080 --> 52:50.120]  I don't know.
[52:50.120 --> 52:52.080]  I guess I feel like the Neo was fine.
[52:52.080 --> 52:55.080]  The Duo was like, okay, that's like,
[52:55.080 --> 52:57.120]  if we're, this is all about symbolism,
[52:57.120 --> 53:01.440]  then by all means, watch, you know, announce it all you want.
[53:01.440 --> 53:03.320]  I'm a little unsure about what they're trying
[53:03.320 --> 53:06.360]  to accomplish there, but hey, they, they, they,
[53:06.360 --> 53:08.040]  they announced, they announced an Android phone.
[53:08.040 --> 53:09.000]  So, so there you go.
[53:09.000 --> 53:12.720]  And that's not coming out until the end of 2020 by there.
[53:12.720 --> 53:14.640]  It's just, it's, I don't know.
[53:14.640 --> 53:18.920]  And then I went to put these show notes together and,
[53:18.920 --> 53:21.560]  and for, you know, for the, me and you talking here,
[53:21.560 --> 53:24.440]  and it was actually hard to find links
[53:24.440 --> 53:27.720]  to the other products because all of the stuff like.
[53:27.720 --> 53:28.960]  Yep. Everyone talks about that.
[53:28.960 --> 53:31.440]  I mean, everything like on the entire front page
[53:31.440 --> 53:34.040]  of the Verge is, is about the Duo and the Neo.
[53:34.040 --> 53:37.000]  It, you have to go to like page two to find the stuff
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.440]  that, you know, is actually shipping.
[53:39.440 --> 53:40.280]  Yep. Yeah.
[53:40.280 --> 53:44.360]  And like, I don't know, like the way, I mean, again,
[53:44.360 --> 53:47.040]  if you do just the Neo and it's like, okay, yeah,
[53:47.040 --> 53:49.320]  window, hardcore windows developers,
[53:49.320 --> 53:51.120]  I could see them spending time in the next year
[53:51.120 --> 53:53.600]  as to be the hot device in windows world.
[53:53.600 --> 53:56.160]  And, you know, they'll adapt their applications.
[53:56.160 --> 53:57.400]  I mean, but the Duo,
[53:57.400 --> 54:00.440]  what Android developer is going to put in special support
[54:00.440 --> 54:01.280]  for the Duo?
[54:01.280 --> 54:03.320]  Like what are we accomplishing by announcing a year early?
[54:03.320 --> 54:05.560]  No, one's going to go out of their way to support it.
[54:05.560 --> 54:07.400]  I mean, I don't know.
[54:07.400 --> 54:09.240]  Like I said, I can buy the Neo
[54:09.240 --> 54:11.000]  and announcing it a year ahead of time
[54:11.000 --> 54:12.800]  because you want developer support,
[54:12.800 --> 54:15.400]  but that doesn't actually make sense for the Duo.
[54:15.400 --> 54:17.880]  It kind of felt like they just, they had,
[54:17.880 --> 54:19.280]  they were making it an Android product
[54:19.280 --> 54:21.920]  and they wanted to announce it and say, huh, look at this.
[54:21.920 --> 54:25.720]  And yeah, I didn't quite get it, but whatever.
[54:25.720 --> 54:27.800]  Like I said, it doesn't really matter, so.
[54:31.040 --> 54:33.320]  All right, what else do we got here?
[54:33.320 --> 54:35.000]  I guess that's enough Microsoft talk.
[54:35.000 --> 54:36.480]  Let's talk iPhone, right?
[54:36.480 --> 54:37.320]  So what'd you get?
[54:37.320 --> 54:40.160]  You got the iPhone 11 Pro.
[54:40.160 --> 54:43.560]  iPhone 11 Pro, I think it's the perfect size.
[54:43.560 --> 54:46.160]  With the old version, when they had the WIPs,
[54:46.160 --> 54:47.760]  I thought it was too small.
[54:47.760 --> 54:50.760]  And so I did do a couple of years of the large ones,
[54:50.760 --> 54:52.240]  which I didn't like, it was a little big,
[54:52.240 --> 54:53.520]  but I just found the screen too small.
[54:53.520 --> 54:55.960]  The other ones, once the 10 came out
[54:55.960 --> 54:57.880]  and it went edge to edge,
[54:57.880 --> 55:00.880]  it got the screen size that I wanted, fit in the hand.
[55:00.880 --> 55:03.880]  So I'm very happy with the size.
[55:03.880 --> 55:06.560]  So no, so I don't need to change.
[55:06.560 --> 55:08.080]  And I'm very pleased with it.
[55:08.080 --> 55:10.160]  And you got the yellow leather cover?
[55:10.160 --> 55:13.240]  I have the yellow leather cover with the green case.
[55:13.240 --> 55:15.960]  It really is very, very Green Bay Packers like.
[55:15.960 --> 55:17.520]  I think the yellow looks great
[55:17.520 --> 55:18.840]  when it's just sitting on the table
[55:18.840 --> 55:23.440]  with the screen up and it's this yellow edge around it.
[55:23.440 --> 55:25.240]  Yeah, I'm pretty pleased with it.
[55:26.560 --> 55:27.400]  And how's your battery life?
[55:27.400 --> 55:29.000]  I did get the clear case originally.
[55:29.000 --> 55:30.320]  I ordered it with a clear case.
[55:30.320 --> 55:32.120]  So like, oh, finally they actually have a color
[55:32.120 --> 55:33.360]  for the high-end phone.
[55:33.360 --> 55:34.600]  Cause I always liked the colors.
[55:34.600 --> 55:36.080]  So I was wanting, but of course
[55:36.080 --> 55:37.960]  I'm gonna get the high-end phone
[55:37.960 --> 55:41.440]  cause I'm fortunate enough to do that.
[55:41.440 --> 55:44.920]  But the, so I got the clear case,
[55:44.920 --> 55:47.800]  but I've always gotten the leather cases previously.
[55:47.800 --> 55:50.360]  And I was not a fan of the clear case.
[55:50.360 --> 55:52.960]  I felt it ended up looking grimy on the back.
[55:52.960 --> 55:54.120]  I didn't like the feel of it.
[55:54.120 --> 55:56.200]  The buttons were terrible.
[55:56.200 --> 55:58.760]  So it lasted about a week.
[55:58.760 --> 56:02.520]  And then I went to the new Apple store here in Taipei
[56:02.520 --> 56:05.040]  and I actually didn't know there was yellow
[56:05.040 --> 56:08.520]  and was pleasantly surprised to find this yellow.
[56:08.520 --> 56:10.740]  And I am a happy camper.
[56:12.440 --> 56:14.200]  I have a friend who has the clear case.
[56:14.200 --> 56:15.960]  He likes it a lot.
[56:15.960 --> 56:18.600]  I think it's, you know, polarizing though.
[56:18.600 --> 56:20.860]  It's either you like it or you don't.
[56:20.860 --> 56:21.700]  It's definitely different.
[56:21.700 --> 56:23.260]  Yeah, I mean, I'm used to the leather.
[56:23.260 --> 56:24.860]  So yeah, so it was probably more
[56:24.860 --> 56:26.520]  just a habit thing than anything.
[56:26.520 --> 56:29.200]  Yeah, I have a real problem with cases
[56:29.200 --> 56:32.960]  is that I spend probably,
[56:34.340 --> 56:37.240]  over the years, in the 11 years of iPhone,
[56:37.240 --> 56:39.040]  I've probably spent close,
[56:39.040 --> 56:40.720]  somewhere in the very high 90s,
[56:40.720 --> 56:45.060]  98% of my daily use without any case at all.
[56:45.060 --> 56:46.120]  I mean, certainly in the early years,
[56:46.120 --> 56:47.420]  we didn't even have cases, right?
[56:47.420 --> 56:50.500]  Nobody put cases on like the iPhone 3G that I know of.
[56:52.680 --> 56:54.240]  Cases didn't really come into a thing
[56:54.240 --> 56:56.400]  until like around the iPhone 4.
[56:56.400 --> 56:58.880]  I guess maybe people did have iPhone 3 cases
[56:58.880 --> 57:00.640]  and that's why Apple made the bumpers.
[57:00.640 --> 57:04.880]  I guess I'm wrong that people did have iPhone 3 and 3GS,
[57:04.880 --> 57:09.260]  3G and 3GS cases, because that's when Apple,
[57:09.260 --> 57:11.620]  when the iPhone 4 shipped, they had the bumper.
[57:11.620 --> 57:12.720]  And it turned out, you know,
[57:12.720 --> 57:14.680]  in the whole authenticate thing where they were like,
[57:14.680 --> 57:16.880]  here, we'll just give you the goddamn bumper.
[57:18.240 --> 57:20.520]  But I thought that the reason that they made the bumper
[57:20.520 --> 57:23.920]  with the iPhone 4 was that Apple was, now I recall this.
[57:23.920 --> 57:26.200]  It seemed very clear that Apple was sort of appalled
[57:26.200 --> 57:27.680]  that people were covering up
[57:27.680 --> 57:30.160]  the entire back of the iPhone for the case.
[57:30.160 --> 57:31.320]  So they're like, don't do that.
[57:31.320 --> 57:34.000]  We spend a lot of time, especially with the iPhone 4,
[57:34.000 --> 57:37.680]  we spent a lot of time to make this glass back very pretty.
[57:37.680 --> 57:38.720]  Don't cover it up here.
[57:38.720 --> 57:40.280]  Just put a bumper around the edges
[57:40.280 --> 57:42.320]  if you just want to give it some protection.
[57:42.320 --> 57:44.220]  The fact remains, I just popped my case off mine.
[57:44.220 --> 57:47.320]  I mean, these phones in the hand are beautiful.
[57:47.320 --> 57:48.900]  They're great to hold.
[57:48.900 --> 57:50.400]  It's a fantastic experience.
[57:50.400 --> 57:54.360]  The problem is that I went caseless with the iPhone 7
[57:54.360 --> 57:56.880]  and within about two months,
[57:56.880 --> 58:00.000]  I actually had a large chunk of the front screen missing
[58:00.000 --> 58:02.960]  because it had been dropped multiple times.
[58:02.960 --> 58:05.120]  And you could see, like, into the phone.
[58:05.120 --> 58:09.120]  And ever since then, I have kept the case on
[58:09.120 --> 58:12.040]  for not, I would like to not use the case.
[58:12.040 --> 58:14.740]  I just do not trust myself at all.
[58:14.740 --> 58:19.740]  I chipped the front corner of my iPhone XS last year early.
[58:20.200 --> 58:21.320]  I forget when.
[58:21.320 --> 58:23.040]  It was probably like around December,
[58:23.040 --> 58:25.900]  so maybe like two, three months into owning it.
[58:25.900 --> 58:28.160]  I was getting out of an Uber after dinner
[58:28.160 --> 58:30.760]  and had, like, dress slacks on, which is unusual.
[58:30.760 --> 58:32.960]  You know, usually I'm either wearing jeans
[58:32.960 --> 58:36.720]  or jean-like pants that, you know,
[58:36.720 --> 58:38.100]  your phone doesn't fall out of,
[58:38.100 --> 58:40.000]  yeah, your phone doesn't fall out of jean pockets.
[58:40.000 --> 58:42.360]  You know, most of the slacks that I own are more like jeans
[58:42.360 --> 58:45.520]  or are jeans, but I had dressier slacks on
[58:45.520 --> 58:48.840]  with the pocket where the phone can come right out
[58:48.840 --> 58:51.120]  and just sliding out of the Uber,
[58:51.120 --> 58:52.720]  just boop, right on the street,
[58:52.720 --> 58:54.920]  and it just put a little thing in the corner.
[58:54.920 --> 58:59.360]  And it just barely didn't reach the pixels.
[58:59.360 --> 59:02.280]  So it's just, the chipped part was just,
[59:02.280 --> 59:05.340]  and the iPhone XS has a very small black bezel
[59:05.340 --> 59:06.180]  around the screen.
[59:06.180 --> 59:09.220]  So it was, the entire chipped part was in the black area.
[59:09.220 --> 59:12.360]  So I didn't get it fixed, and it didn't spread at all
[59:12.360 --> 59:14.920]  in the subsequent nine to 10 months
[59:14.920 --> 59:16.180]  that I used it every day.
[59:17.600 --> 59:19.420]  So again, sort of like my MacBook Pro
[59:19.420 --> 59:21.600]  with the adhesion problem,
[59:21.600 --> 59:24.240]  it was just sort of like a scar that I came to like.
[59:24.240 --> 59:25.920]  You know, if it had covered the pixels at all,
[59:25.920 --> 59:28.400]  I would have been at the Apple store in the morning.
[59:28.400 --> 59:30.440]  You know, like, one pixel had been covered by it.
[59:30.440 --> 59:31.480]  I would have been at the Apple store
[59:31.480 --> 59:33.600]  to pay for a replacement.
[59:33.600 --> 59:34.420]  But-
[59:34.420 --> 59:36.300]  I actually just got my tennis fixed because,
[59:36.300 --> 59:38.360]  oh, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.
[59:38.360 --> 59:41.560]  But I did use a case last year with, afterwards,
[59:41.560 --> 59:44.040]  because I find, I have, I've personally found
[59:44.040 --> 59:48.560]  the glossy glass backs to be slippery.
[59:48.560 --> 59:51.540]  And sometimes they're not, depending on, you know,
[59:51.540 --> 59:53.620]  the moisture of your hands, they're tacky.
[59:53.620 --> 59:55.320]  But there are other times when they,
[59:55.320 --> 59:56.760]  it's like a bar of soap.
[59:57.920 --> 59:59.400]  So I did use a case last year,
[59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.840]  but my problem is that I'm not satisfied with any of them.
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:04.640]  So I wound up buying like 10 cases that I-
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.400]  Yeah, I know, that's exactly what happens.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.560]  I very seldom use any of them.
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:12.640]  Yeah, no, I was, I was traveling,
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:16.180]  and I'm in the middle of a conversation,
[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:18.520]  this group chat and WhatsApp or whatever,
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:22.200]  and suddenly my phone just stops, like, it's not working.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:24.040]  And so I'm trying to restart it,
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.120]  and finally I had to do the force quit
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.800]  with the volume buttons and the power button.
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:31.880]  I turn it back on, and I can't get it to function.
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:33.880]  And like, there's a dead part of the screen.
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.320]  Basically what happened was,
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:38.080]  there was this vertical strip on the touchscreen
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.520]  that just stopped working.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.680]  And it was so perfectly placed
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.160]  that I couldn't accomplish anything on my phone.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.960]  Like, there was a part of the keyboard that wasn't working.
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.440]  I couldn't slide the thing to turn the phone off
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:50.400]  because it would hit the dead part of the screen.
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.340]  And it was really quite bizarre.
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:53.680]  And then the weirdest thing was,
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:57.280]  I finally sent it in to get it fixed, and I get it back,
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:59.920]  and I have the sheet that says,
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.520]  oh, we, Xem, your phone, we fixed this.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.520]  And not only did they fix the touchscreen,
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:05.800]  they put a new camera in the phone.
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.640]  Apparently my camera had gotten broken too.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.760]  I have no idea.
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:12.040]  I was actually always very dissatisfied with the XS camera.
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:15.700]  Maybe it was broken all along and I had no idea.
[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:20.440]  But now I have basically a brand new XS and my 11.
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.440]  But it's funny, I should sell it
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:25.120]  because it's now in beautiful, pristine condition.
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:29.960]  But it turns out traveling
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.960]  and having your phone die is devastating.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:35.960]  I mean, it's like, so I'm actually gonna keep this.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.160]  I'm not gonna sell it.
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.660]  And I'm going to keep it charged up
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:41.660]  and I'm going to put it in my bag when I travel.
[01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:42.500]  It's the same thing.
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:45.000]  It's like when this stuff's to your wife
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.600]  and it's like, yeah, I do buy new phones
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:51.780]  because I get paid, I need to be online all the time.
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:52.700]  I need to be reading stuff.
[01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:54.080]  I need to be knowing what's going on.
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:55.540]  And I destroy my batteries
[01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:57.320]  because I'm using my phone all the time.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.880]  But that means I need backups.
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.480]  And you have to think about this all the time.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.780]  Actually, you mentioned this about applications.
[01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:05.260]  I could switch to Windows
[01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:08.220]  because one of the things I did a few years ago
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:11.720]  was I made it, I will not use any application
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:12.720]  in my day-to-day work
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.020]  that does not have a web service component to it.
[01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:18.460]  Because my feeling is if my computer dies tomorrow,
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:21.200]  I need to be able to walk and get any computer in the world,
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.880]  Windows or Mac, and be up and running and get my work done.
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:27.140]  And so like, I won't use...
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.180]  And it's actually, it's a very interesting way
[01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:32.080]  to think about some of your computing things.
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.680]  Probably the application I was the saddest to give up
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:37.620]  was OmniFocus, or not OmniFocus, OmniOutliner.
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:38.460]  Yeah, OmniOutliner.
[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:39.280]  Brilliant Outliner.
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.860]  I use Workflowy instead,
[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:43.460]  which is not nearly as fully featured as good,
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:45.520]  but it has a web component.
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:48.900]  So it's a solid line for me.
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:52.300]  I have to be able to have access to my stuff no matter what.
[01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:53.140]  Who knows?
[01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:56.140]  Maybe there will be an online component to OmniOutliner
[01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:58.940]  because they actually did it for OmniFocus.
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:00.800]  They did, and I actually switched back to OmniFocus
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:01.640]  once they did it,
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:03.380]  because I switched away for that reason.
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:06.080]  And once they added it, I was back,
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:08.780]  because it's, I mean, I love their products in general,
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:11.720]  but I've been a longtime user of OmniFocus in particular.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.820]  Sponsor of the live episode of the talk show this year
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:18.160]  at WWDC, and I loved my blurb about it,
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:21.320]  where we're all bitching about companies
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:25.040]  that only make web apps and shovel them into a Mac wrapper
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:28.200]  and call it a Mac app, and Omni did it.
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.100]  They shoveled a Mac app into a web wrapper.
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:33.100]  Right, which is just so totally Omni.
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:34.440]  I love it.
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.700]  So maybe OmniOutliner's next.
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:38.780]  I have friends there, but I don't know any such thing,
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:40.380]  so maybe not.
[01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:44.020]  Maybe OmniFocus, the nature of OmniFocus
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:47.560]  sort of suits it to being web-appified
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:50.380]  in a way that the other productivity apps don't.
[01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:51.220]  But anyway.
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:52.060]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:53.540]  Because I mean, with OmniOutliner,
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:55.940]  and you can save stuff to a shared folder or whatever,
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:56.780]  which is fine.
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:58.700]  It's more a matter of, actually,
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:03:59.980]  because I used to work at Microsoft,
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:03.740]  and when I was at, I remembered a very formative moment was
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:06.980]  I needed a particular document that I knew I had made.
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:08.460]  And so I go into my Dropbox,
[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:10.180]  and I'm like, where's this document?
[01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:12.180]  And the document was in pages format.
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:14.380]  And the problem was, I was on a Windows computer.
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:16.620]  There was no pages online at that point.
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:19.700]  And so I remember I had to literally go into my car,
[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:22.900]  drive home, get my Mac, open up this document,
[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:25.360]  and then come back, and I'm like, never again.
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:27.380]  I'm never gonna be stuck in a situation again
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:29.380]  where I can't access something I need.
[01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:32.180]  Well, good for you.
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:34.020]  But I'm very extreme.
[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:36.500]  No need to copy me.
[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:42.220]  Well, what the hell were we talking about?
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:43.060]  Oh, the iPhone.
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:43.880]  Oh, the iPhone 11.
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:44.720]  iPhone 11.
[01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:50.420]  The camera is, you can't say enough about it.
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:52.580]  It's consistently fun to use.
[01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:55.420]  Like I was taking pictures, I ran over
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:58.180]  to a friend's house before, I was taking my dog with me.
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:00.100]  And she knows that we're going to this particular house,
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:02.900]  because they have a yard, which is relatively rare in Taiwan.
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:04.060]  They have a couple dogs.
[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:05.740]  And so she sees the neighborhood,
[01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:07.340]  and she's getting super excited.
[01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:10.080]  And I've taken pictures of her, and it's relatively dark,
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:12.380]  and you get these really cool pictures of her
[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:15.160]  with their paws out the window, all pumped up.
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:20.160]  And it's just a whole new world that was not accessible
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:23.980]  as far as having my phone with me before.
[01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:26.740]  And I find that coming up all the time,
[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:29.680]  and just all the, like the Deep Fusion thing or whatever,
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:30.980]  hasn't even launched yet.
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:33.300]  But it's really remarkable.
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:37.280]  Like just, it's very tangible in the way it makes me feel
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:39.880]  about the phone and enjoy having the phone.
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:41.980]  Like it's so noticeable.
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.620]  Yeah, and it's just, it's rather startling
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:49.620]  just as somebody who's been a photo enthusiast.
[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:52.000]  Now, I'm certainly not professional caliber in any way,
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.840]  but I've been a photo enthusiast for 20 years,
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:59.560]  and it's just remarkable sometimes the images
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:03.240]  that you get out of it in the dark with the night mode.
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:05.960]  It's, and you know, even when you're not using night mode,
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.040]  it's just a great camera.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:12.040]  And I noticed with the XS,
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.000]  and this is clearly a better camera,
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.920]  but I was on a family vacation.
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:18.200]  We went on a cruise with my family and my sister
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.920]  and her family in August.
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:24.120]  And I took my Fuji X100S,
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.520]  and I took a bunch of photos with it,
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.840]  but also took a bunch of photos with my phone.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:31.600]  And then I was like looking at them
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.800]  in photos after the trip.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.420]  And I was like, oh, this one I had to shoot with the Fuji.
[01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:39.240]  And I'd like do the command I, you know, on the Mac,
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:43.200]  you can get the command I to see the metadata
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.040]  about the phone.
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.260]  I was like, nope, that was the iPhone.
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:47.160]  Like I really, you know,
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.040]  there were a couple of shots that with the Fuji
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.880]  where I was like, I'm a hundred percent sure
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:53.160]  that was the real quote unquote, real camera.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.840]  And it was, so I'm not saying
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.080]  that they're indistinguishable,
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.400]  but there were some where I was like,
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:06:59.920]  what the hell camera did I use for this?
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:02.800]  And I was totally blown away that it was the iPhone.
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:04.640]  Like you really can take camera,
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:07.360]  camera quality photos with it.
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:08.600]  And in the dark, it's better.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:11.620]  It is actually a better camera in low lighting
[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:14.600]  in like a dark restaurant or something like that.
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:17.960]  Than a $5,000 SLR.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.140]  It really is, it's unbelievable.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:24.040]  Yeah, I mean, it's fun.
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:28.480]  Like it's a feature that is like enjoyable and fun to use.
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:31.280]  And you know, at this stage of sort of
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:35.140]  the smartphone evolution, you know, it's nice.
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:38.800]  I mean, the XS was, the biggest thing for me
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:40.280]  with the XS relative to the X,
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.640]  and I know this guy was using the X
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:45.200]  when my XS was broken, is the face IDs
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:47.000]  was just so massively better.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.180]  I mean, face ID on the X, go back,
[01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:51.880]  like, I mean, again, we're the most,
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:53.600]  we are the people that Brian Shannon
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:54.600]  at the New York Times hates
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.720]  because we buy a new phone every year.
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:01.500]  But going back to the X, the face ID was miserable.
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:04.520]  It was painful to use.
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:07.640]  So that, but like the rest of it was like, eh, yeah.
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:11.060]  There's really not much difference here from using it.
[01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:12.520]  But the 11, like, I don't know,
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:15.520]  the 10, both the 10 and 10S camera,
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:18.660]  I was actually not a big fan of either of them.
[01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:21.640]  I just felt they looked very phone camera-ish
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:22.680]  in a lot of situations,
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:24.760]  particularly with any harsh light in them.
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:29.120]  And the 11 is just like, it's like taking photos for fun
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.380]  in a way that I haven't done in a long time.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.940]  My son still has an iPhone 10,
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:37.920]  and we were out to eat last week,
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:41.280]  and I just shot a little bit of video using
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:44.040]  his two-year-old iPhone 10 and my new phone.
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.280]  And the video difference is,
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:49.360]  it's under-heralded how good the video is on these phones.
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:50.800]  And like, I was talking with Joanna Stern
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:52.460]  on the last episode of this show
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:56.920]  about my family looking back at some,
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:01.360]  like, 14, 15-year-old video of my son when he was a baby,
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:05.420]  which I had to shot on a mini DV camera,
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:07.800]  which was, I thought was tiny at the time.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:08.640]  I loved it.
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:09.460]  It was-
[01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:11.840]  Well, my daughter, I think I had the Flip camera.
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:12.800]  Yeah, we talked about that.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.640]  Yeah, Joanna and I talked about that, too.
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.500]  We have a lot of footage of Jonas
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:19.360]  from about three or four years later in the Flip era.
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:21.400]  It's just, it's not heartbreaking, quite,
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:23.040]  because it's great that we have the video.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:26.520]  And when I was a kid, me and Amy,
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:27.840]  it's probably true for you, too.
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:30.260]  I mean, is there any video of you from when you were a kid?
[01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:31.100]  No, not at all.
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.500]  I mean, yeah, my parents never,
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.520]  I don't know if they even owned a video camera ever.
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:37.360]  I mean, video cameras weren't even a thing
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:39.720]  until the 80s, and my parents never bought one.
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.280]  And in the 70s, when I was a baby,
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:45.240]  you had to shoot Super 8 film.
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.400]  And so there is some footage of me.
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:48.320]  I have it in a closet.
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:50.120]  I actually should pay the price
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.920]  and send it somewhere to get it digitized.
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:55.600]  There is, I do have some reels of Super 8 film
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:58.600]  that my uncle, my mom's brother shot of me and my sister.
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:02.680]  There's like a combined, and like Super 8 was fun.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:03.560]  And when I was in college,
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:05.260]  I made short films shooting Super 8.
[01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:08.120]  And it was kind of fun because it looked so much better
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.680]  than video in a weird way,
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:12.020]  because it was, Super 8 is film.
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:14.600]  And so, you know, but it was really hard to shoot,
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:16.240]  and it didn't have sound.
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:20.120]  And because it was so expensive,
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.280]  shooting film, even Super 8, you know,
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:23.960]  it's called Super 8 because it's eight millimeter,
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.760]  this tiny little frame of film,
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.720]  it was very expensive to get developed
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:30.760]  compared to photos.
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:33.620]  And so most consumer Super 8 cameras
[01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:37.880]  would shoot 18 frames per second instead of 24,
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:38.720]  just so you could save-
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:39.560]  Stop motion.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:40.720]  Yeah, so you could save money.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:43.000]  So you kind of get like that Charlie Chaplin
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  silent film effect,
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.180]  even though you might've been shooting color.
[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:47.320]  But anyway, there was no video.
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.920]  So it's great that we have hours of video of Jonas
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:50.740]  when he was a baby,
[01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:54.340]  but the footage, the quality is just horrendous.
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:56.540]  It's just absolutely appalling.
[01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:59.440]  But it's just unbelievable to me that just two years,
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:04.440]  iPhone 10, which was $1,000 cell phone two years ago,
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:07.480]  the video quality in low light with shooting video
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:10.880]  compared to the iPhone 11 is just astounding.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.520]  It's just hard to believe it's two years.
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:13.840]  Like looking back at it,
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:16.640]  my point is looking back at 15 year old mini DV footage,
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.200]  well, 15 years, of course,
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.920]  of course the difference is striking and it's stunning.
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:22.680]  It's cool that you can get this,
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:25.160]  not just with a dedicated video camera now,
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.920]  but with your phone, your phone shoots it,
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.340]  but 15 years is 15 years,
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:30.580]  but two years, it's insane.
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:34.560]  It's absolutely insane how much better the video is
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:35.800]  on the iPhone 11.
[01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:40.600]  I guess the other thing I should touch on
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.160]  and the director's commentary,
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:43.320]  what have I written about this week
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:45.880]  at Daring Fireball aspect of the podcast is the,
[01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:51.860]  something has not sat right with me all month long
[01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:56.860]  regarding night mode and which cameras on the pro
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.300]  it applies to.
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:07.560]  And I was left talking with Apple off the record with,
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.920]  when you get these review units,
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.800]  you talk to Apple throughout the week
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:13.600]  that you're reviewing them and you get phone calls
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.800]  and you can't quote them, they're off the record,
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:17.240]  but they answer all your questions
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:20.320]  and they're usually very forthcoming and very, very accurate.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:22.560]  And while from a marketing standpoint,
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:25.680]  I totally get that they want to keep it very simple
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.720]  and they don't get into technical details,
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:32.240]  but like with people like me and Matthew Panzerino
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:37.240]  and Nilay Patel who like to write about the camera stuff
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:41.280]  and explain how it works as best we can,
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.320]  they're remarkably forthcoming.
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.760]  But with the night mode stuff,
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:48.000]  when I'd ask questions about like,
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.680]  okay, so it doesn't work with the super wide angle,
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:53.320]  the ultra wide 0.5 X lens.
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:55.320]  And they're like, no, the night mode doesn't work.
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:59.060]  It's, the sensor doesn't have any focus pixels,
[01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:00.440]  so can't do it.
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:06.280]  When I, and obviously it works with the standard 1X lens.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:08.880]  And I asked questions,
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.880]  I was under the impression that on the iPhone pro,
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:13.660]  that when you go into 2X, you can get night mode
[01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:16.320]  because there's a 2X button and it looks like it.
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:20.120]  And I asked questions about it and about like,
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:22.980]  well, why does it work with these lenses?
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:24.320]  And the answers were weird.
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:27.440]  I don't think I was lied to at all.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:30.280]  And I've, Nilay and I have chatting about this,
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.240]  behind the scenes.
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:35.480]  But the answers just were,
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:38.440]  the best word I can come up with is obfuscatory.
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:40.880]  They just weren't, it was just weird.
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:43.680]  It's just, it just was, I was like, all right.
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:47.460]  And then it turns out that it doesn't use the 2X lens
[01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:48.300]  in night mode.
[01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:52.600]  When night mode kicks in and you're at the 2X zoom level,
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:56.820]  it uses the 1X camera to take a night mode shot
[01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:59.040]  and then crops to a 2X zoom
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:02.880]  and just does a digital zoom to go up.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:06.080]  And that's how, that happened in low light
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:10.460]  with iPhone dual camera systems all the way back to,
[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:12.680]  I forget the, what was the first one that some of the plus,
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.480]  like the iPhone 6S Plus,
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:16.000]  when did they first add the second camera?
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.320]  I forget even.
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.200]  I think it was the iPhone 7.
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:20.400]  Yeah, maybe iPhone 7.
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:21.240]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:23.800]  So like the iPhone 7 Plus had two cameras
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:27.440]  and the iPhone's regular smaller iPhone 7 only had one.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:31.080]  And the seven, the dual camera was what they call telephoto.
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:32.400]  It's 2X zoom.
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.240]  And in low light, even then.
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:35.080]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:36.200]  Cause that's, I think that's one of the first time
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:37.120]  I got the larger phone.
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:38.600]  Right, cause you wanted the best.
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:39.720]  Right, you wanted the best.
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:40.540]  Yeah.
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:43.320]  Even if you didn't like the size, a lot of people,
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:45.320]  I didn't do that, but I'll let you, you know,
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:46.440]  it was a tough decision.
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:49.300]  But anyway, even back then, all throughout that,
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:53.140]  in low light, the iPhone would make a decision that,
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:54.860]  and it's, you know, again,
[01:14:54.860 --> 01:14:56.120]  there's nothing scandalous about it.
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:57.800]  They were doing this because they,
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.260]  it was to get the best image.
[01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:03.400]  That in low light, because the sensor for the telephoto lens
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.240]  is less sensitive, you know,
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:07.400]  it's not as good as the 1X sensor.
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:09.080]  And especially in low light,
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:12.880]  they concluded that in certain lighting situations,
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:15.040]  it would be better to just use the 1X camera
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:20.040]  and digital zoom as opposed to the true optical 2X camera.
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:23.720]  It turns out it still works like that in night mode.
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.200]  And again, there's nothing scandalous about it.
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:28.600]  They're doing what gets the better image
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.540]  and everybody loves night mode,
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:32.000]  including when you're zoomed in.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.200]  Like people are taking 2X shots with night mode
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:39.240]  and loving the images they're getting.
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:42.060]  So it's not scandalous that they're using
[01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:44.200]  the 1X camera to get them.
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.100]  They're doing what gets the best shot.
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:50.480]  But there was all sorts of confusion about night mode.
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:53.900]  Did it require 100% focus pixels?
[01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:56.980]  And like the Panzerino was told something like that.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:00.240]  And then we concluded, okay,
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:03.140]  so the 1X and 2X cameras have 100% focus pixels,
[01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:04.120]  but that's not true.
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.600]  And there's like, you know, Phil Schiller had a slide
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:11.600]  when he was on stage that the 1X camera sensor
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.480]  does have 100% focus pixels on the sensor,
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:17.560]  but the 2X camera just has quote focus pixels.
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:20.320]  So it has some focus pixels.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:23.720]  The 0.5X ultra wide has no focus pixels.
[01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:28.220]  So in a sense, putting it all together,
[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:30.820]  what Apple told us behind the scenes was kind of true,
[01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:35.200]  that apparently night mode does require 100% focus pixels
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:37.040]  because it only works-
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.260]  That just means they're only using one camera.
[01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.100]  Right.
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:43.320]  But then the thing that still confused me was,
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:47.200]  well, why didn't they make this clear to us?
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:50.120]  And then I figured it out, like a day after writing,
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:51.560]  it was like I was chatting with Nilay
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:55.040]  and I literally had like a light bulb moment,
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:58.600]  like the closest you could get to an actual light bulb
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:03.600]  popping over my head and turning on was, oh, I get it.
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:06.000]  It's uncomfortable for them to talk about
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  because it means the regular iPhone 11
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.560]  takes the exact same 2X zoom level night mode shots
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:17.560]  as the $400 more iPhone 11 Pro.
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:20.720]  That's the rub.
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.520]  And that's what makes it the whole thing
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.760]  a little uncomfortable for them to talk about.
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:29.080]  And there's no 2X button on the iPhone 11.
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:31.840]  To get to 2X zoom, you have to pinch
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.820]  or use the little scroll wheel
[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:36.320]  that they added in the camera app.
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:40.220]  But when you get to 2X zoom and night mode kicks in,
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:42.540]  the iPhone 11 takes the exact same night mode shots
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:43.820]  that the iPhone 11 Pro does
[01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:46.380]  because neither one is using the telephoto lens
[01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:48.760]  because the iPhone 11 doesn't have a telephoto lens
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.420]  and the iPhone 11 Pro
[01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:52.720]  doesn't use the telephoto lens for night mode.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:56.620]  So anyway, that was like my big light bulb moment
[01:17:56.620 --> 01:17:57.940]  of the week.
[01:17:57.940 --> 01:17:59.420]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:03.520]  I have to say, I mean, it's only been a few weeks,
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:07.460]  but I definitely enjoy and use the wide angle lens
[01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:09.820]  more than I feel like I ever use the telephoto lens.
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:10.880]  Yeah.
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:15.440]  It really opens up an entirely sort of new sort of photo.
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.180]  Whereas the telephoto lens,
[01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:19.300]  it's like it's not telephoto enough
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:21.200]  to be really particularly useful.
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:23.620]  It's this weird sort of middle ground.
[01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:25.540]  Yeah, and like I was talking to a friend
[01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:30.540]  whose kids are really talented young baseball players.
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:35.080]  I mean, and so their family is always
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:37.780]  going to little league baseball games.
[01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:41.820]  They have two sons and baseball games all the time.
[01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:45.780]  And he was asking if they should get the 11 Pro or the 11,
[01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:46.860]  his wife needs a new phone.
[01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:48.620]  And I said, well, you guys,
[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:53.340]  like for shooting baseball games, the telephoto is better,
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:54.860]  but it's still not like,
[01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:57.060]  you're not like going to get a closeup of your kid
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:58.660]  in the batter's box from the bleachers.
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:18:59.500]  You know what I mean?
[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:02.620]  Like it's not as, you still might,
[01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:04.040]  if you really want to get good pictures
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:06.740]  of something like a sporting event or like your kid
[01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:09.900]  on stage in a school performance or something like that,
[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:13.700]  you still want a real camera that has a real zoom lens
[01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:16.420]  that's longer focal length than the tele,
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:18.740]  quote unquote, telephoto on the iPhone 11.
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:19.580]  I think you're right.
[01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:22.540]  And I think that, I think they made the right decision
[01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:25.640]  with like the iPhone 11 where, okay,
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:28.020]  we're going to go to three lenses on the more expensive Pro,
[01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:31.440]  but the 11, which is going to be significantly lower price,
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:32.860]  is going to have two lenses.
[01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:35.220]  Should it get a telephoto or should it get a wide angle
[01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:36.060]  or ultra wide?
[01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:38.620]  I think the ultra wide is more useful.
[01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:41.220]  Yeah, we haven't talked since the presentation,
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:45.260]  but to me, this was my big takeaway from the whole thing
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:47.100]  is that Apple cut prices.
[01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:49.460]  Like they cut, and they cut prices pretty significantly.
[01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:52.340]  And it was, it's a bit hidden because the high end
[01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:53.380]  is the exact same.
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:59.780]  But the bit about the iPhone 11 being cheap,
[01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:03.500]  cheaper than the XR was last year.
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:06.980]  And then also the XR being reduced in price
[01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:10.020]  by much more than phones had been reduced in price
[01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:11.480]  sort of previously.
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:13.340]  To me, I think it's a pretty big deal.
[01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:17.340]  And I think what I sort of discussed at the time was,
[01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:23.140]  that's what a company that actually is focused on services
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:27.020]  should be doing because you actually do want to have,
[01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:30.380]  the way those sort of businesses work is you're putting in
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:33.940]  a lot of expense upfront, but then you're trying to spread
[01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:38.420]  it out over the maximum number of folks on the back end.
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:41.420]  And that's why Google is fine to have $50 Android phones
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:43.700]  that's that many more people that can sort of,
[01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:45.860]  they get leverage on their services for.
[01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:50.380]  And this is Apple at least sort of hinting at
[01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:53.820]  actually changing their pricing strategy
[01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:57.380]  in a way that favors this sort of services approach
[01:20:57.380 --> 01:20:59.780]  where services isn't just something we sort of backed into
[01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:02.900]  because of this app store and we can have this narrative
[01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:04.460]  or our strategy hasn't changed.
[01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:08.220]  Here is a hint that the strategy has actually shifted a bit.
[01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:11.460]  And the 11 to your point, I mean, it's an incredible phone.
[01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:13.460]  I mean, even particularly with,
[01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:16.020]  by having that wide angle lens,
[01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:18.860]  it's even more competitive than the XR was.
[01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:21.140]  The XR was already extremely competitive.
[01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:23.320]  And I really, Joanna and I talked about this.
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:25.640]  I really think, and I got a little pushback on it
[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:28.540]  from some people, but I really think that for the most part,
[01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:33.540]  people should get the one level up from base storage.
[01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:35.900]  So both phones start at 64 gigabyte storage.
[01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:38.820]  I totally agree, that's not enough.
[01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:41.300]  And some people it is, and that's the, I get it.
[01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:43.940]  And there are, for those of you who sent me email
[01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:45.980]  and tweets saying, hey, I've,
[01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:48.380]  I'm only using 38 gigabytes on my phone.
[01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:49.760]  So 64 is plenty for me.
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:52.420]  And I use the cloud storage for everything.
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:56.740]  So I get it, but that's an informed decision.
[01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:58.500]  And the people who listen to this show
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:01.620]  who know that they really can fit their life comfortably
[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:04.300]  in a 64 gigabyte base model storage,
[01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:06.820]  that's, you know, you know what you're doing.
[01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:09.220]  I think for typical people though,
[01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:12.180]  especially if you wanna shoot lots of 4K video
[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:16.400]  and stuff like that, you should go up a level.
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.980]  But that's where the pricing difference is really stark.
[01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:20.420]  And I'll just emphasize it again,
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:24.840]  because the 11 goes to 128 and it's only 50 bucks more.
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:29.300]  So for 50 bucks, you can double your storage from 64 to 128.
[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:32.380]  And it's nothing like the old days
[01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:35.380]  where we complained so vociferously
[01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:38.140]  about the 16 gigabyte base model storage.
[01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:39.340]  It was unbelievable.
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:40.180]  Right.
[01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:43.260]  And it kept going on year after year after year.
[01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:46.940]  Right, and you have to remember that that 16 gigabyte
[01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:48.960]  needed to include the system software.
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:52.160]  So however many gigabytes iOS and the apps
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:54.620]  that you'd include and Apple likes to give you,
[01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:55.720]  you know, every time you upgrade,
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:58.240]  they stick you with GarageBand again,
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:22:59.300]  which is a great app.
[01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:00.700]  It's a fantastic app.
[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:03.580]  But I have no musical inclination at all.
[01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:07.140]  And GarageBand is like a 380 megabyte app.
[01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:09.580]  And I guess that they load some of that stuff on demand,
[01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:11.060]  so it's not really taking up the space.
[01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:15.060]  But anyway, the 16 gigabyte phones included the OS.
[01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:16.580]  The 64 gigabytes do too.
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:19.380]  And it's not, you know, you get most of that 64,
[01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:20.300]  I guess, to use.
[01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:22.860]  But when you go from 64 to 128,
[01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:25.740]  the entire extra 64 you get to use.
[01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:27.820]  That's not used by the phone.
[01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:32.820]  But the iPhone 11 Pro is just like the previous high end,
[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:38.460]  the 10 and the 10S at that thousand dollar plus price tier,
[01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:41.580]  you have to go all the way to 256 from the base model.
[01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:46.120]  And it costs $150 to go from the base model to that.
[01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:49.900]  So to me, there's a $300 difference
[01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:52.460]  at the 64 gigabyte base model tier.
[01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:56.640]  But there's a $400 difference between the 11 and the 11 Pro
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:58.900]  if you just go from the usable tier.
[01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:01.820]  Yeah, and again, it's not apples to apples
[01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:04.720]  because the 11's 128 and the Pro is 256.
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:09.020]  But that 128 is so much good enough
[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:10.340]  for most typical people.
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:12.220]  So to me, it's a $400 difference.
[01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:13.940]  And I think that's significant.
[01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:16.280]  I do question, I question how much of it,
[01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:19.180]  lowering the prices.
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:21.100]  I think you're exactly right,
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:25.140]  that the 11 is $50 less than the comparable 10R models
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:26.980]  that were last year and the 10R,
[01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:30.140]  and I think this is really, I think it's a huge deal
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:34.000]  and really does justify calling the overall lineup
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.900]  as being lower priced is that the 10R
[01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:37.340]  really dropped in price.
[01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:38.500]  I forget what it's cost, but-
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:41.220]  $150, it's 599.
[01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:43.740]  And it used to only drop 100.
[01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:47.340]  Yeah, well, not just that, but the iPhone 8 dropped 152.
[01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:50.740]  So the iPhone 8 went from 599 to 449.
[01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:55.700]  So yeah, so not just the, yeah.
[01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:58.820]  So basically everything other than the top end model
[01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:03.080]  went down by price by at least $50 more
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:04.180]  than it did previously.
[01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:06.860]  I question, I just wonder, I don't question it,
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:08.900]  but I wonder how much of it is strategic
[01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:11.860]  and how much of it is just,
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:15.620]  that they didn't really want the 10R
[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:17.300]  to cost as much as it did last year,
[01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:20.420]  but that's what it cost if they were gonna maintain
[01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:21.260]  their margins.
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:22.520]  There might be something to it,
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:24.460]  particularly for memory pricing.
[01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:28.340]  Cause I remember when the iPhone 8 jumped up to 699,
[01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:32.420]  that was at a time when DRAM pricing was through the roof.
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:35.540]  And so actually Apple's margin on that phone
[01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:38.140]  wasn't that much greater because a huge part
[01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:42.780]  of that increase was eaten up by memory pricing.
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:45.740]  So there, and right now, DRAM prices are very low.
[01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:47.900]  So you may be right.
[01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:51.140]  It may be that the memory,
[01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:53.580]  this is driven more by the cost of their components.
[01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:56.420]  And that's one of the biggest costs in the phone.
[01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:58.600]  And it's one of the, one that changes the most.
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:00.320]  I mean, memory is notorious for,
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:02.280]  it goes to these peaks and valleys
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:04.940]  and it's been doing that for 50 years.
[01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:07.740]  It's gonna be doing it for the next 50 years.
[01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:11.300]  So that might be part of it, but at the same time,
[01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:13.500]  you know, once they raised the price,
[01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:16.180]  they could have that, exactly.
[01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:17.860]  And just taken the extra margin.
[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:20.540]  And they didn't, they brought it back down.
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:22.420]  And to me, that's a good sign.
[01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:25.700]  It's a, you know, Apple,
[01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:28.860]  there's always been the vague sort of concern that,
[01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:31.300]  you know, does Apple care a little too much
[01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:33.460]  about their margins and not enough about
[01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:35.980]  sort of the ecosystem viability?
[01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:37.300]  And it turned out with the iPhone
[01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:39.740]  that the market was so large
[01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:41.420]  that there was enough room for two.
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:43.700]  There are, you know, both iOS and Android,
[01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:45.040]  and particularly with iOS, you know,
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.480]  customers' willingness to buy and whatnot.
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:51.660]  But when it comes to services and stuff that you invest in,
[01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:54.060]  and you need to sort of spread out those costs
[01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:55.420]  and the maximum number of people,
[01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:57.100]  this isn't really an ecosystem question.
[01:26:57.100 --> 01:26:59.580]  iOS is a viable ecosystem without question.
[01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:03.140]  But at this point, from Apple's perspective,
[01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:05.920]  every single extra iPhone that's out in the market
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:09.300]  just makes the rest of their company's business that much,
[01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:14.220]  you know, the profit, you make it up in volume,
[01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:16.040]  like in a very real sense.
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:21.040]  Yeah, and I do think that DRAM is certainly part of it.
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.560]  I think that the Face ID versus Touch ID
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:24.840]  is a little bit more expensive.
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:28.180]  And I know that the XR and now the 11
[01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:29.800]  don't have the super fancy
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:33.320]  and clearly expensive OLED display.
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:34.840]  Oh yeah, that's crazy expensive.
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:37.660]  But I do think it has to be more expensive
[01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:42.660]  to make the 11's LCD with the round corners
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:45.700]  that goes close, you know,
[01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:48.720]  again, the bezels are slightly larger than on the pro models,
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:53.480]  but you know, compared to the old forehead and chin iPhones,
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:54.360]  it's more expensive.
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:56.880]  So the display, even though it's only quote unquote
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:59.720]  only an LCD, I think it's a wonderful display.
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:01.820]  It's still, it's gotta be a little bit more expensive.
[01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:04.040]  I think Face ID is clearly a little bit more expensive
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:04.880]  than Touch ID.
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:06.200]  So I think it was a little bit of column A
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:07.240]  and a little bit of column B
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:09.860]  where the XR had to be a little more expensive.
[01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:12.460]  But I think you're right that once they bit the bullet
[01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:14.520]  and raised those prices, they could have kept them there.
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:16.300]  And they clearly chose not to.
[01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:20.160]  And I think it's, I think it's great for consumers.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:21.000]  I really do.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.760]  It's just a, as these 11 settle in,
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:27.800]  I just think that the value proposition
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:30.300]  of the regular iPhone 11 is just phenomenal.
[01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:34.440]  It's, you get the great 1X camera,
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:35.980]  that's exactly the same.
[01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:38.400]  You get the ultra wide, which is probably more useful
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:40.640]  for more people than telephoto.
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:42.640]  Same exact A13 chip.
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:44.760]  You get it, it's not the same display,
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:46.520]  but it's a great display.
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:47.880]  You get the great battery life.
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:48.880]  It's just a great phone.
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:50.680]  And now it's a little bit less price.
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.580]  And I think it's great for Apple too.
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:55.560]  Yeah, so the rumor, it's rampant now.
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:58.640]  And Ming-Chi Kuo had an article or a report
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:00.560]  that was circulating this week.
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:02.840]  I was gonna say confirming it,
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:04.280]  but as close as we can get to confirming
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:08.040]  that Apple's full steam ahead on this rumored SE2
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:13.040]  for early in 2020, which will look like supposedly
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:19.760]  an iPhone 8, but we'll have the A13 chip
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:24.080]  from this year's phones, which is exactly what Apple did
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:28.600]  with the SE years ago when it came out.
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:33.140]  They used previous generations hardware design,
[01:29:33.140 --> 01:29:36.000]  which was the iPhone 5, 5S design.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.240]  But when the iPhone SE came out,
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:41.240]  it had whatever the A series chip was from the,
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:43.080]  it was, I guess it was the iPhone 6.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.320]  And for the record, the iPhone 5S
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:49.680]  was the pinnacle of iPhone design.
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:51.740]  You know, I spent a day with my iPhone.
[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:53.560]  I don't have an, I never bought an SE,
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:55.280]  so I don't have an SE to use,
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:30:00.280]  but I still have my iPhone 5S and I do it every year.
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:02.840]  It's like I put my SIM card in it and spent a day with it.
[01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:07.040]  And it's like, man, this is what an easily pocketable,
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:08.720]  lightweight design.
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:10.880]  Oh, it's just gorgeous.
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:11.840]  It's absolutely gorgeous.
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:13.280]  It also feels so sturdy.
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:15.840]  It feels like, I don't know why anybody ever put a case on.
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:17.400]  It just feels like you could literally throw it
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.600]  against a wall and it wouldn't crack.
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:20.440]  Yep.
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:22.080]  Yeah, no, I don't think I used a case then.
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:23.960]  I think I switched the cases once they got too big
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:26.000]  to sort of keeping your hand.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000]  But because the iPhone, the 4 was incredible,
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.280]  but that glass back was,
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:34.680]  like once they went to the all metal enclosure,
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:38.160]  like that was like, that's where it really hits, right?
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:41.000]  Well, and it, so spending a day with my iPhone 5S
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.480]  in addition to the size, which I want to come back to,
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:47.600]  cause I think that's the thing that is most gonna upset
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:51.980]  people about the rumored iPhone 8 size of this SE 2.
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:54.400]  But the other thing that really struck me,
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:56.300]  it's size and weight, unbelievable.
[01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:58.600]  The fact that it's so light makes it feel so,
[01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:01.080]  it just feels like you could, if it fell off your desk,
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:02.400]  it would be no problem.
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:04.640]  The fact that it's aluminum instead of glass on the back,
[01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:08.340]  but that's what struck me about that aluminum on the back,
[01:31:08.340 --> 01:31:12.680]  is I do have a Qi charger on my nightstand.
[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:17.060]  It is not that much more convenient
[01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:19.720]  than just plugging in a cable or having a dock,
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:22.400]  especially if you have a table, you know, bedside dock
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:24.280]  where you can stick your phone overnight
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:25.800]  to charge overnight.
[01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:29.120]  Like I do have the wireless charger from my phone,
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:33.480]  I use it, but I would probably happily trade
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:36.840]  to have an aluminum back on my iPhone 11 Pro
[01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:39.340]  and give up Qi charging.
[01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:43.800]  And there's still rumors that maybe in a software update,
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:46.540]  Apple's going to enable the iPhone 11s
[01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:49.480]  to charge your Apple Watch if you put it on the back
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:50.320]  or something like that,
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:52.840]  that there might be a two-way charging.
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:54.080]  That's all nice, it's neat,
[01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:57.880]  but I would honestly trade it for an aluminum back.
[01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:01.240]  Just, I like the way it feels, and I like the durability.
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:02.520]  I mean, have you seen the prices?
[01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:05.440]  If you crack the back on your iPhone 11 Pro,
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:09.600]  it's like a $399, or maybe it's $399
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:13.440]  if you have AppleCare Plus and it's more, it's like $600.
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:15.540]  It's like, you honestly might be better off
[01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:18.240]  just keeping it and buying another one.
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:20.420]  It's ridiculously expensive.
[01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:22.120]  I don't even understand how that can be
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:27.120]  because it's not the display, but it's very expensive.
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:31.200]  As far as I know, the whole reason they've gone
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:33.680]  to glass backs is for the Qi charging.
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:35.960]  Because you can't-
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:38.920]  I'm so sick of, the problem is,
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.120]  is that for at least for me,
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:43.740]  whitening cables always go bad over time.
[01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:46.960]  And that time when you wake up and you grab your phone
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:50.080]  and it's not charged because the cable
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:52.160]  is just kind of starting to not work here,
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:54.000]  it got jiggled or whatever it might be.
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.920]  And what I like about the Qi charging is
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:58.600]  you set it on there, it buzzes,
[01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:00.160]  and it's going to actually charge.
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:02.280]  And it's not going to like your wake up
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:03.200]  and find a dead phone.
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:06.260]  So I have a Qi charger on my desk too.
[01:33:06.260 --> 01:33:07.580]  I could plug it in there.
[01:33:07.580 --> 01:33:08.420]  That'd probably be fine.
[01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:11.000]  I'd plug it in, I have a cord here also.
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.520]  But honestly, just for that peace of mind
[01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:15.760]  that I know the phone's gonna be charged for sure
[01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:20.040]  when I wake up, I am pro Qi charging.
[01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:22.920]  But there's also an argument that I should
[01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:24.600]  get my shit together and have working cables.
[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:28.280]  So I could go in both directions.
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:30.920]  It just occurred to me, just using the 5S for a day,
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:34.200]  it just occurred to me that glass is a very odd substance
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:38.620]  to make a thousand dollar to $1,500 device out of.
[01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:39.460]  You know?
[01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:40.280]  It is, it is.
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:42.040]  Like you go into the Leica store
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:45.260]  and they're selling $5,000 cameras.
[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:49.140]  And it's like, I mean, I guess they have an LCD display
[01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:50.900]  on the back now, so that could crack.
[01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:53.520]  But they're not gonna make the majority
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:55.820]  of the frame out of glass.
[01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:58.140]  Like it's just, when you think about it,
[01:33:58.140 --> 01:34:01.700]  it's just an odd, it's just odd that we have these
[01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:04.520]  very expensive cameras that are made out of glass,
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:05.480]  front and back.
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:07.440]  I mean, the front being glass is obvious
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:09.840]  because it's all display, it kind of has to be.
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:11.760]  It's just kind of odd that the back is glass
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:12.960]  when you think about it.
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:15.520]  Size.
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:19.600]  So I know that, I guess I should write about it,
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:21.780]  but in a way, I know that there are people
[01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:23.640]  who love that 5S eyes.
[01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:26.440]  And you called it the pinnacle of iPhone design.
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:27.280]  People love it.
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:29.360]  And what people really want Apple to do,
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:32.520]  people who love that size, is keep the size
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:34.480]  and just get rid of the chin and forehead
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:39.480]  and put an iPhone XR style LCD display in
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:43.640]  with rounded corners that takes up the whole front surface.
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:46.560]  So you'd get more screen area,
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:49.160]  but you would still have that same basic,
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:51.480]  entirely pocketable design.
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:56.040]  And by all of the accounts, that is not what Apple's doing.
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:59.440]  They're going with an iPhone 8 form factor
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:01.840]  with touch ID and the chin and forehead.
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.440]  Which is disappointing if you love that small size,
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:08.920]  but it should be to me unsurprising.
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:10.360]  Cause in a way what they're doing,
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:11.960]  like I said a couple of minutes ago,
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:15.240]  they're doing exactly what they did with the SE.
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:18.160]  And the SE I don't think was defined by the size
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:19.360]  from Apple's perspective.
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:22.360]  It was for people who were fans of the size,
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:23.600]  but from Apple's perspective,
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:27.640]  it was let's just take our previous generation form factor
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:30.960]  and update the internals to the latest and greatest
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:32.440]  and sell it at a low price.
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:35.720]  Apple's not gonna invest in a completely new
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:37.480]  industrial design for what's gonna be
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:38.560]  a very inexpensive phone.
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:40.920]  Like this is just not gonna happen.
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:44.360]  So yeah, they're gonna use what they have.
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:48.560]  And again, yeah, I can see the allure.
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:50.600]  I have no desire to use a 5S.
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:52.760]  I'm glad that they're getting rid of it
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:53.960]  probably for our developer friends.
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:55.240]  They don't have to worry.
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:56.440]  Hopefully stop worrying about that size
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:57.560]  sooner rather than later.
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:00.360]  But yeah, it's fundamentally an economic issue.
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:03.520]  Like Apple's, like the reason they're doing that
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:06.000]  is because switching out the processor
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.560]  is relatively painless.
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:10.680]  I would, while the other components are gonna stay the same,
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:14.880]  the making the case can stay the same,
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:16.800]  those assembly lines are still alive
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:19.520]  cause they're still making the iPhone 8
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:23.280]  and they're just gonna change out the processor,
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:26.440]  which makes it a much more future-proof phone
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:28.320]  even though the industrial design is old
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:30.760]  and it makes a lot of sense.
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:33.920]  So I don't know, I would guess
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:36.720]  since they're replaying the strategy from the SE,
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:38.760]  I would guess that if you look back,
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:40.960]  I forget exactly when they announced the SE.
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:43.480]  I think it was like either very late in March
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:46.920]  or very early April, if I recall correctly.
[01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:50.120]  I would guess that they'll announce this new iPhone SE,
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:51.720]  whatever they're gonna call it,
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:53.080]  around the same time next year
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:56.200]  cause it just feels like they're just replaying
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:57.640]  that strategy exactly.
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:36:59.760]  And I don't, like you just said,
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:01.840]  production-wise, I can't see how this would be a problem.
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:04.520]  I don't think there's gonna be any kind of delay.
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:05.360]  I think it'll come out.
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:08.800]  Well, and there never was an iPhone 8S,
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:10.280]  so the name is available.
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:11.880]  Yeah, maybe that's what they'll call it.
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:13.880]  That's actually a very good guess.
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:16.560]  I'm gonna steal that, the iPhone 8S.
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:18.400]  Yeah, I like that.
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:20.400]  I'm writing that down, iPhone 8S.
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:23.320]  All right, let me take another break here.
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:25.280]  Thank our next sponsor.
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:29.240]  Boy, this is a new one.
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:30.080]  I love it.
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:32.080]  I love that these guys are sponsoring the show
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:34.840]  cause it's a new sponsor, but they're old friends.
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:36.880]  They're called Yes, Please.
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:40.240]  And it's spelled Y-E-S-P-L-Z.
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:43.440]  I'm guessing that's how you pronounce it.
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:44.280]  I don't know.
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:45.120]  I don't have, they should give,
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:46.920]  everybody should know to give me a pronunciation note.
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:48.160]  So I'm gonna call it Yes, Please,
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:51.520]  but it's spelled Y-E-S-P-L-Z.
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:53.160]  Look, there's all sorts of productivity hacks
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:55.160]  that work great for some people, but not for others.
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:57.960]  But the best productivity tool that performs miracles
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:00.400]  for almost everyone is coffee.
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:03.240]  Oh, I just finished my coffee about two minutes ago
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:05.600]  and I already wish I had more.
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:07.800]  Yes, Please is a coffee subscription service
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:09.480]  that wants to bring you the very best
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:11.400]  fresh roasted beans into your kitchen.
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:13.120]  Do you need a coffee subscription?
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:14.920]  How often do you run out of coffee at home?
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:16.800]  If it ever happens to you,
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:18.520]  you should treat it as an emergency
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:21.160]  and get a coffee subscription service.
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:23.800]  True coffee fiends are pretty good about never running out,
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:26.400]  but true fiends also know that scoring the very best stuff
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.520]  can be hit or miss.
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:31.520]  The crew at Yes, Please online at Yes, Please,
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:35.600]  Y-E-S-P-L-Z dot coffee.
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:39.600]  Very cool top level domain there, Yes, Please dot coffee.
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:42.120]  Sources and roasts, some of the finest stuff
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:43.280]  from all over the world.
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:45.760]  They change it up every week and deliver it to your door.
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:49.640]  Whole bean coffee delivered weekly, fortnightly, monthly,
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:51.320]  or just whenever you need it.
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:54.040]  Pause or cancel anytime, no hassle.
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:55.880]  Each new release comes with a fresh issue
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:58.160]  of their eclectic weekly print zine
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:01.200]  featuring culture, music, food, and art.
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:03.200]  It's a nice analog moment for your mornings
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:06.200]  in our increasingly digitally distracted world.
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:07.040]  Now here's the best part.
[01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:08.840]  It's founded by Tony Tonks,
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:13.080]  Connessy, Connessney, just call them Tonks,
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:16.680]  and Sumi Ali.
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:19.400]  They're veterans of coffee's weird third wave scene.
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:21.520]  Longtime listeners of the show might remember
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:24.160]  coffee subscription pioneers Tonks Coffee
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:25.320]  from back in the day.
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:27.720]  They used to sponsor this show all the time.
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:29.880]  Tonks, great coffee.
[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:33.800]  Well guess what, that's who's behind Yes Please.coffee.
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:35.840]  These guys believe great coffee shouldn't require much fuss.
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:37.800]  Making a perfect cup of coffee is as easy
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:39.800]  as making a box of Kraft macaroni and cheese.
[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:40.640]  I believe that.
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:42.920]  The best way to make coffee are very simple.
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:44.980]  But you have to start with best beans
[01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:47.160]  and have to start with fresh beans.
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:48.800]  The rest is just water.
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:51.240]  Invite Yes Please into your kitchen and brew it yourself.
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:56.240]  Head to yesplease.coffee and use offer code TALKSHOW25.
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:00.560]  TALKSHOW25, all one word, and you get 25% off
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:02.700]  your first box, upgrade your morning coffee game
[01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:04.320]  and you'll upgrade your whole day.
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:06.520]  Love that these guys are sponsoring the show.
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:09.400]  What else we got here, Ben?
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:12.760]  Just waiting on charcoal.
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:19.760]  I'm gonna talk about the Boeing 737 MAX saga briefly.
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:22.200]  It's fascinating.
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:24.840]  I know we've been sharing messages about this.
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:29.320]  I'm generally, like I think maybe a lot of tech geeks,
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:31.160]  I'm an AV geek.
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:33.800]  I love following the airline industry generally.
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:38.960]  My favorite blog, there's a thing called the Cranky Flyer.
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:39.800]  Great blog.
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:42.960]  Another guy, Jon Ostror, runs a subscription site
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:44.680]  called The Air Current.
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:46.320]  So I love reading about this stuff in general
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:47.840]  and have for a long time.
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:52.120]  But this whole 737 thing has been, it's incredible.
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:54.960]  It's incredible on multiple dimensions.
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:59.880]  It's starting to, when it first happened,
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:04.880]  the first crash was the one in, I think Indonesia?
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:06.560]  I forget which one was first,
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:09.680]  but there were two deadly crashes, tragedies.
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:12.680]  First one, it's sort of like fool me once,
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:15.400]  shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:17.200]  It's like the first one, it's like,
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:18.880]  I don't know, who knows what happened, maybe it was a fluke.
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:20.400]  The second one, everybody was like,
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:23.160]  hey, what, something is wrong with this plane, right?
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:24.200]  That just doesn't happen.
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:26.920]  And they were both weird crashes.
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:29.480]  It's just very weird.
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:31.320]  The details start coming out
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:33.840]  and this whole story about them,
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:40.000]  it just read like bad leadership of that.
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:45.200]  Basically, when a new plane comes out with new controls
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:46.600]  and a new flight, what do they call it?
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:47.440]  A flight.
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:50.560]  Envelope. Envelope.
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:55.040]  Pilots, this seems like a good rule.
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:58.320]  Pilots have to be retrained on this
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:01.600]  because if a new plane flies differently
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:02.960]  than what the pilot is used to,
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:06.360]  the pilot needs, all the pilots need to train on it.
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:09.560]  And the major airlines have a lot of pilots.
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:11.240]  And so in the aggregate,
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:13.920]  a new plane would require an aggregate
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:16.040]  large number of pilot training hours,
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:18.160]  which, you know.
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:22.160]  So you can see why the airlines would like to buy planes
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:24.840]  that pilots don't need to retrain on
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:27.880]  because that would save them money of, you know,
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:29.320]  they'd rather have to be paying their pilots
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:31.640]  to fly flights than to train.
[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:33.920]  But you can also see why there is a law
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:36.480]  that if the plane flies differently,
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:38.040]  the pilots need to retrain, right?
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:40.320]  Both things make perfect sense.
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:43.600]  And what happened with the 737 MAX is it flew differently
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:46.320]  and Boeing knew that would be a bad, a hard sell
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:47.400]  to the airlines.
[01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:52.160]  And so they used software to try to make it fly
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:55.280]  like previous 737s.
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:43:00.280]  And it turns out that's exactly as bad an idea as it sounds.
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:03.560]  Yeah, and it was particularly bad
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:05.960]  because, you know, the traditional distinction
[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:07.360]  between sort of Boeing and Airbus
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:09.840]  is that Airbus has really leaned into the,
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:11.600]  look, the computer's actually flying this
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:13.360]  and there's kind of a human there.
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:15.160]  Whereas Boeing's been more of a, look,
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:17.360]  and no matter what, the human is in control.
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:20.000]  Like it's the pilot's plane.
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:24.360]  And so in a weird sort of way,
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:26.720]  it's almost like this would have been better off
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:30.040]  on an Airbus plane where you kind of expect the plane
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:31.520]  to be in control.
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:34.240]  But the fact that a Boeing plane,
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:37.360]  you expect the pilot to be in ultimate control
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:39.120]  and it turned out they weren't,
[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:41.000]  like almost made it even worse
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.920]  because it was against sort of the ethos and understanding
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:46.000]  of what these planes sort of mean.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.920]  Yeah, and it really shines a spotlight
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:53.400]  on the rot at the center of Boeing's company culture.
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:57.040]  And, you know, this is all old hat to you.
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:01.400]  I'm way less of a aviation nerd than you or Dan Frommer,
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:03.480]  but I'm kind of into it and it's interesting.
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:05.360]  And Boeing has always been a fascinating company,
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:07.400]  but basically long story short,
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:11.480]  Boeing was always known as an engineering driven company.
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:16.480]  And, you know, and the record speaks for themselves.
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:20.360]  Like the 737 came out in like the end of the sixties
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:23.720]  and was like their best-selling plane until like recently.
[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:26.600]  It had like three decades at the top.
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:27.440]  Oh, it still is.
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:28.760]  I mean, it still is, yeah.
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:30.800]  It's just a phenomenal design.
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:32.320]  You know, that doesn't happen
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:35.520]  without truly great engineering and design.
[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:40.520]  And secondarily Boeing traditionally always had a firewall
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:44.920]  between their commercial aviation division
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:47.840]  and their military division.
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:51.400]  And the military stuff for obvious reasons
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:55.480]  is much more bureaucratic and not as engineering driven
[01:44:55.480 --> 01:45:00.120]  because all sorts of, you know, you end up with,
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:01.680]  you know, everybody knows the pork barrel stuff
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:06.000]  where somebody, some Senator from Montana wants to have
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:08.840]  something in the state, you know,
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:11.560]  let's make the screws for the wings in Montana,
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:13.600]  whether that's the best decision or not,
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:16.840]  it's a political decision, not an engineering decision.
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:19.840]  And then in the nineties,
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:24.200]  Boeing acquired McDonald Douglas,
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:27.120]  which was primarily ostensibly a competitor at the time,
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:29.640]  but it was much more focused on the military stuff.
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:32.800]  And however it came about,
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:34.240]  the McDonald Douglas leadership
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:35.800]  wound up in charge of Boeing.
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:36.800]  It's sort of like, you know,
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:38.840]  one of those quote unquote reverse acquisitions,
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:40.400]  like when Apple acquired Next
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:42.160]  and Steve Jobs and the Next crew
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:44.440]  wound up running the company.
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:46.280]  But definitely a bizarro version of that.
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:49.200]  A bizarro version because with the Apple and Next,
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:51.840]  it was terrific leadership that was focused
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:55.480]  on exactly the right thing, which is great products.
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:57.920]  And the McDonald Douglas thing was the opposite.
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:45:59.880]  Instead of focusing on making great airplanes,
[01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:02.880]  it was like squeezing money out of, you know,
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:04.640]  pinching corners and making decisions
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:06.560]  like the 737 Max, which-
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:09.800]  Well, the thing is before the 737 Max was the 787,
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:12.000]  which was an absolute disaster.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:15.360]  And there they tried to outsource everything
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:19.560]  and were trying to like put the costs on everyone else.
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:22.280]  And they were getting pieces that were coming together
[01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:23.720]  that didn't even fit together.
[01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:26.160]  And there was like, they forgot to design,
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:30.000]  to specify like how the wires would connect with each other.
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.120]  Just an absolute disaster that ended up spending way more
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:34.400]  than they would have otherwise.
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:38.920]  And delayed hugely, which also led to the 737 Max,
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:41.240]  where instead of building a completely new plane
[01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:42.760]  like they probably should have,
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:44.520]  they said, well, let's re-engine
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:47.520]  sort of the venerable 737 one time.
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:49.120]  So it's not just this,
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:53.920]  it's a cascading series of decisions over years.
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:57.600]  And it's amazing that these same folks are,
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:01.560]  yeah, I mean, it's a,
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:03.800]  this is a mess Boeing that is in right now
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:06.640]  that has been building for like 20 years, 25 years.
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:07.920]  And there's lots of other stuff in there,
[01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:09.440]  like Weber and Ress,
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:13.240]  they built a new factory down in a non-union state.
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:17.000]  And there's been apparently a ton of problems with those,
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.520]  this isn't a union commentary,
[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:21.160]  so they've always built their airplanes in Washington.
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:24.040]  And they moved away from that, not for engineering reasons,
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:27.000]  to your point, but for other reasons.
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.640]  And that's led to a lot of problems.
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:30.720]  And they moved their headquarters to Chicago,
[01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:32.240]  which is stupid.
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:37.320]  I mean, it's literally been like 25 years of ineptness,
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:41.520]  but all those decades of engineering leadership
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:45.520]  have carried them through because the 737 was been selling,
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:48.440]  the 777 was an absolutely brilliant plane.
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:51.600]  And I think it's like the most profitable plane ever
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.520]  that has carried them through.
[01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:57.640]  And everything since then has just been a total mess.
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:47:58.480]  Yeah.
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:01.280]  And it's just sort of heartbreaking
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:02.480]  because a great company,
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:06.120]  a company that has a decades long record
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:07.640]  of being a great company
[01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:09.640]  is like a great thing to appreciate.
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:14.240]  And it's just sort of a sad thing to see it.
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:15.600]  And it wasn't like,
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:18.360]  sometimes a great company fades away
[01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:20.680]  because what they do fades away.
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:24.440]  Maybe Kodak is a good example.
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:26.320]  And certainly you can make the argument
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:28.920]  that Kodak should have seen the digital thing coming.
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:30.120]  And they had some great-
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:31.600]  They invented the digital camera.
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:32.920]  That's the crazy thing about it.
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:33.760]  Right.
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:36.000]  And instead of
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:41.440]  obsoleting themselves,
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:43.560]  obsoleting their own film business
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:45.920]  with the up and coming digital business,
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:48.520]  they tried to stick their heads in the sand
[01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:50.240]  and say film isn't going away.
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:56.640]  So I guess Kodak is sort of not the best example
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:48:58.280]  because that's sort of a tragedy too.
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:48:59.400]  I do think it's a good example though.
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:01.360]  Because to your point,
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:03.000]  a lot of companies go away
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.960]  because their industry and their place in the industry
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:08.040]  goes away through technological change.
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:09.720]  And with Boeing,
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:12.840]  actually airplanes and commercial airplane sales
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:15.640]  are a bigger and more important industry than ever.
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:16.480]  Right.
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:17.640]  It's completely self-inflicted.
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:18.480]  Right.
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:19.480]  Yeah, that's my point.
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:21.560]  Yes, it is completely self-inflicted
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:24.200]  and that just is hard to watch.
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:26.280]  That is just sad.
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:27.520]  And then what sucks about it,
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:29.520]  the 787 is a perfect example.
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:33.920]  Boeing, if they would have just developed the 787
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:36.600]  the same way they developed every plane previously
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:38.440]  and built it the same way previously
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:40.760]  and did most of the work themselves in Washington
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:42.000]  like they did previously,
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.240]  they would be in phenomenally better financial shape
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:45.080]  than they were.
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:46.160]  Than they ended up being.
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:48.600]  And so like, it's not only,
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:51.200]  it's like one thing if you cheap out,
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:52.880]  but at least you saved money,
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:55.160]  even though it might not have been as good
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:56.040]  as it would have been otherwise,
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:58.600]  they cheaped out and ended up spending way more
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:00.160]  in the long run.
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:02.760]  It's like, it's really,
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:06.600]  it's really a phenomenal,
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:08.480]  just run of mismanagement
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:11.960]  over literally a couple of decades.
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:13.320]  Yeah, and that's just,
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:15.160]  self-inflicted is just exactly,
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:16.520]  that just gets to the core of why,
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:17.680]  what I wanted to talk about.
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:19.160]  And it's just a bit sad.
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:21.120]  Hopefully they can turn it around.
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:21.960]  I don't know.
[01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:24.200]  It feels to me like this max situation
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:27.120]  is gonna be a legal nightmare for them.
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:27.960]  Oh yeah.
[01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:29.320]  I mean, cause the news that came out this week
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:31.200]  was that there was a whistleblower within the company
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:32.640]  in the engineering division
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:35.960]  whose report more or less
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:39.240]  before any of these planes crashed,
[01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:41.120]  more or less said that this is not,
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:44.720]  this is all a disaster and management has ignored
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:47.800]  our warnings about this,
[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:50.640]  that they pretty much ignored
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:54.160]  warnings from within the engineering division
[01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:56.760]  that the problems that we now know are real,
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:50:57.960]  we're going to be real,
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:00.360]  which is probably not good
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:04.600]  in terms of their liability for these things.
[01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:07.040]  Speaking of self-inflicted,
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:09.320]  you've been writing a bit about the Apple in,
[01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:13.280]  Apple in China and Hong Kong and whatnot stuff.
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:18.280]  And I think there's a meta point to be made here.
[01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:21.840]  I've been writing about Apple in China,
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:25.600]  basically for ever since the Trump election, I think.
[01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:29.800]  And maybe before, certainly before that,
[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:30.960]  I'm trying to remember when exactly
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:32.640]  I was horny on this point,
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:35.520]  but it's very, very interesting.
[01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:39.440]  And what's interesting is Apple was by far
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:42.480]  the most successful sort of consumer tech company
[01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:43.960]  in particular in China.
[01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:45.720]  And the reason is because they had
[01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:47.520]  the right perfect business model.
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:49.920]  They weren't a service which could be blocked
[01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:51.040]  by the great firewall.
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:53.040]  They weren't pure software which could be pirated
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:55.440]  like Microsoft software was always pirated
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:59.400]  because they sold software differentiated hardware.
[01:51:59.400 --> 01:52:00.840]  They could go into China
[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:02.760]  and make the exact same margins in China
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:04.400]  that they were making everywhere else
[01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:07.240]  and be tremendously profitable doing so.
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:12.280]  It turns out though that what goes around comes around.
[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:17.280]  And after several years of China being a huge profit center,
[01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:21.680]  now it's a huge problem.
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:25.720]  And obviously Apple's sort of exposed on both sides
[01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:28.200]  where they have the manufacturing there
[01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:30.560]  and they have the huge market there to sell.
[01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:33.680]  And they are more than any other tech company
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:38.680]  by at least US tech company stuck in this trade war
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:40.440]  and not just a trade war,
[01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:44.240]  but to the extent there is a sort of ideological war,
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:46.040]  it's a very tough place to be.
[01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:50.040]  Yeah, because the other tech giants
[01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:51.600]  don't have physical goods.
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:55.760]  I mean, Apple, Facebook, I mean, they make stuff.
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:53:00.760]  Facebook has these gadgets and Amazon makes the gadgets
[01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:02.400]  and Google's makes gadgets.
[01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:04.280]  And as we just talked about at the beginning of the show,
[01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:05.480]  Microsoft makes gadgets
[01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:07.920]  and they all do make their own gadgets.
[01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:10.160]  But for all of those other giants,
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:12.120]  the gadgets are a side business.
[01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:13.680]  And for Apple, it's the inverse
[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:17.440]  that the vast overwhelming majority
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:18.880]  of the company's revenues and profits
[01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:21.520]  come from selling iPhones in particular,
[01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:25.280]  but gadgets, overall the services are the,
[01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:27.600]  again, they're growing, they're right to focus on it.
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:28.440]  We don't have to talk about it,
[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:31.480]  but it's Apple services revenue is dwarf
[01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:32.560]  compared to the hardware stuff.
[01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:34.640]  And the hardware stuff, the iPhone in particular,
[01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:36.240]  they're all made in China.
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:39.040]  And so they're completely square in the middle
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:41.800]  of the trade war with the Trump administration.
[01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:44.720]  I think it's always been, hmm,
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:46.000]  this seems a dangerous place
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.560]  to put all your eggs in one basket
[01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:52.560]  because it's a communist dictatorship.
[01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:55.680]  I wanna dwell on that
[01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:58.680]  because it's the most interesting about this
[01:53:58.680 --> 01:54:00.760]  is the whole Apple doctrine
[01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:02.040]  and the Cook Doctrine and all sort of stuff
[01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:05.160]  talks about this idea of we need to control
[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:07.120]  our most important technologies.
[01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:11.680]  And it turns out like maybe the most important Apple
[01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:15.000]  sort of skillset and capability
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  is its ability to manufacture massive numbers of devices
[01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:22.760]  that are very highly engineered
[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:25.640]  and are manufactured at an extremely high level of quality.
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:28.960]  And it turns out that they don't have control of that.
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:30.960]  Like they don't have control
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:34.280]  because it's in another country
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:38.640]  that follows a different value system
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:42.040]  than the one that Apple does broadly speaking.
[01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:43.720]  I mean, there's certainly,
[01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:46.680]  the whole thing about Apple privacy is a human right.
[01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:48.960]  Like it rings a bit cello
[01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:54.760]  given their position in China in some respects.
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:58.240]  And also they're stuck in the middle of this trade war.
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:03.240]  And leaving aside, which is extremely difficult to do,
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:04.840]  so bear with me here,
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:08.480]  but leaving aside the Trump sort of angle here,
[01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:12.760]  like this collision of the US and China,
[01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:15.880]  I think in many respects is bigger and broader than Trump.
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:17.440]  And it was probably,
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:19.440]  there was a degree that was inevitable
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:21.400]  is going to happen at some point.
[01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:24.000]  And I think what is a little concerning
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:25.920]  from the Apple perspective
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:28.600]  is it kind of feels like they didn't see it coming at all.
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:33.600]  And they're stuck and they really have no good options.
[01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:35.960]  Right, and there was a bit of news last week
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:39.080]  where Apple officially announced that the new Mac Pro,
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:41.880]  just like the previous trashcan Mac Pro
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:44.520]  will be manufactured in Austin, Texas.
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:49.080]  And that there's some kind of exemption from the tariffs
[01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:53.520]  that will allow them to import some of the components
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:55.920]  from China without paying tariff, blah, blah, blah.
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:59.960]  But the Mac Pro is literally the most niche product,
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:01.600]  hardware product that Apple makes.
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:03.800]  It might as well be called the Mac niche.
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:06.920]  I mean, it's by definition, I mean, it starts at five
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:09.280]  and then there's nothing wrong with that,
[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:12.760]  but it's a $5,000 and really the configurations
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:15.240]  most people who want and need a Mac Pro
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:17.560]  are gonna cost a lot more than $5,000.
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:21.040]  It's the price of a compact car.
[01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:25.200]  You mean 128 gigabytes of hard drive is not sufficient?
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:26.040]  Probably not.
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:29.680]  It's like, oh yeah, I work at Pixar
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:31.840]  and here I've rendered one frame.
[01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:37.280]  I've got one frame of the movie here on my Mac Pro.
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:42.280]  I can, yeah, probably not, but they are in no position.
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.380]  I mean, so that news, I'll mention it,
[01:56:45.380 --> 01:56:46.800]  but I mean, they are in no position
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:48.720]  to move iPhone production out of China.
[01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:51.020]  I mean, it's really staggering.
[01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:52.400]  I would love to,
[01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:57.960]  it just must be an amazing thing to behold
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:02.960]  with how many, to be able to produce 70 million
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:07.040]  or however many tens of million iPhones in a quarter
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:09.520]  with a brand new design and stuff like that.
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:12.080]  It's just staggering when you do the math
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:14.600]  and just think about how many they're making a day,
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:16.560]  that there's like a million of them literally
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:21.240]  and how many million shipped on Friday, September 24th
[01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:25.980]  or whatever the day was when people who pre-ordered
[01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:28.000]  the minute that the pre-orders went available
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:29.600]  got their iPhones.
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:32.040]  Just staggering to think how many of these things come out.
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:35.280]  They're in no position to move that elsewhere or diversify.
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:36.120]  I mean-
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:37.760]  Yeah, and people are gonna email and say,
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:40.680]  cause they have set up factories like Brazil and India
[01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:43.080]  primarily to get around really restrictive
[01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:45.240]  sort of import controls in those countries,
[01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:47.600]  but they're not remotely capable of scaling
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:51.200]  to servicing the rest of the world the way China is.
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:56.200]  And they're stuck, Apple's really fundamentally stuck.
[01:57:56.360 --> 01:58:00.420]  They are not really capable of going elsewhere.
[01:58:00.420 --> 01:58:05.220]  And at the same time, as you've been writing about,
[01:58:05.220 --> 01:58:07.020]  it's kind of getting to be an increasingly
[01:58:07.020 --> 01:58:10.280]  untenable position, particularly in the context
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:12.640]  of Apple's rhetoric around the sort of company
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:15.640]  they claim to be and the things they claim to believe in.
[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:18.640]  Right, and privacy is a human right.
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:22.080]  Literally that's words that come out of their mouths.
[01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:26.760]  Tim Cook has said, privacy is a fundamental human right.
[01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:29.680]  China is a surveillance state.
[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:32.040]  I mean, I don't mean to laugh,
[01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:35.640]  it's actually not funny at all, it's tragic.
[01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:38.680]  It is difficult.
[01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:40.760]  Now I'm of the opinion that the fact that Apple
[01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:45.520]  is in the Chinese market and sells iPhones,
[01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:47.040]  and you and I have talked about this a lot
[01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:51.160]  about how they're, we don't have to rehash it now,
[01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:53.560]  but that their success in the Chinese market
[01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:56.560]  has waxed and waned significantly,
[01:58:56.560 --> 01:58:58.620]  more significantly than they have in other markets
[01:58:58.620 --> 01:59:00.720]  because the Chinese market is unique.
[01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:05.720]  And the people, you don't get locked into the Android
[01:59:06.260 --> 01:59:10.120]  or iOS ecosystems in China the way you do
[01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:13.000]  in other countries, because China has its own stuff,
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.160]  and you just use that stuff on an iPhone
[01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:16.600]  or you use it on an Android phone,
[01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:18.760]  and if you want to switch to a Huawei phone,
[01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:20.920]  you just switch and your stuff moves over.
[01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:23.520]  And you've talked about how,
[01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:26.240]  so that stuff like having a new rose gold color
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:28.640]  is very much more important in the Chinese market
[01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:30.600]  than elsewhere because being able to signify
[01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:33.000]  that you have the new top of the line iPhone
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.760]  is more important because that might be really more
[01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:37.640]  than iOS or any part of the ecosystem,
[01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:40.120]  that's why people are doing blah, blah, blah.
[01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:42.000]  I don't think it's a problem.
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.760]  I think it's very, it requires a nuanced discussion
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:48.680]  to talk about Apple selling iPhones in a market
[01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:54.380]  with politically difficult leadership like China,
[01:59:54.380 --> 01:59:59.380]  because in some ways it's good if you're in China
[01:59:59.380 --> 02:00:02.320]  and you are as a Chinese citizen concerned
[02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:03.760]  with your privacy, isn't it better
[02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:06.560]  that if you're fortunate enough
[02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:08.480]  to be able to afford an iPhone,
[02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:12.160]  isn't it great that you have the option of buying a phone
[02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:14.120]  that probably is more private
[02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:17.600]  than most of the other phones in the Chinese market
[02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:19.160]  and that protects your stuff?
[02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:21.440]  And whatever sacrifices Apple had to make
[02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:24.860]  to host Chinese iCloud accounts on servers
[02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:29.800]  within mainland China, we don't know what's going on
[02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:31.300]  with that and what sort of access
[02:00:31.300 --> 02:00:32.920]  the Chinese state has to that.
[02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:35.760]  But if it's as private as Apple would suggest that it is,
[02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:38.720]  it's better than if Apple just said,
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:40.680]  you know what, we don't support China,
[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:41.960]  we're pulling out, we're not gonna sell
[02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:43.420]  our products in China.
[02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:45.240]  Like I don't think that helps.
[02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:48.740]  Like I get, there's people who want Apple to do that,
[02:00:48.740 --> 02:00:53.040]  who think that if Apple's actions match their rhetoric,
[02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:54.600]  they should take a stance and say,
[02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:56.540]  we won't sell our products in China
[02:00:56.540 --> 02:00:57.960]  because we support privacy
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:00.920]  and China's government is anti-privacy.
[02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:05.160]  I don't know, I get how that would please people
[02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:07.200]  who want Apple to make a stink about this
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:09.260]  and it would certainly raise a ruckus
[02:01:09.260 --> 02:01:10.500]  and draw a lot of attention.
[02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:12.680]  But would that actually be good
[02:01:12.680 --> 02:01:15.680]  for the people in China who want iPhones
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:17.420]  and want the most privacy they can get?
[02:01:17.420 --> 02:01:19.080]  I would say no, it's not good.
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:22.880]  I think that requires nuance.
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:26.280]  But I do think though that as, like you said,
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:27.800]  it's starting to come to a head
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:29.680]  and it's starting to become untenable.
[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:30.520]  And this thing-
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:35.240]  Well, I think the point that you're driving at is, yeah,
[02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:37.680]  the sell of iPhones is one thing.
[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:41.800]  The reason why Apple is in a no-win position
[02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:43.680]  is the manufacturer of iPhones.
[02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:47.600]  Like that's the part that like, they're just like,
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:52.000]  it's literally where else can they go
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:56.160]  and they are paying the price for decisions
[02:01:56.160 --> 02:01:59.000]  that were made many, many years in the past.
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:04.000]  And yeah, it's, I mean, I think they,
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:08.680]  my feeling is they need to start
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:11.120]  in making the sort of investments
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:14.200]  and pushing out into other countries
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:16.320]  and whether it's India or Brazil,
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:18.000]  or they go to Vietnam or wherever it might be,
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.240]  like figuring out ways to start building out.
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:22.320]  But the problem is it's gonna be,
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:25.000]  it's gonna take years, but if it's gonna take years,
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:26.820]  no better time to start than now.
[02:02:26.820 --> 02:02:31.040]  And my concern is that there's just a hope
[02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:32.640]  that this is gonna blow over.
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:33.720]  And you talk about the Mac Pro
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:35.120]  and Apple getting the exemption.
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:38.120]  I mean, it kind of feels like Tim Cook played Donald Trump
[02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:39.480]  like a violin.
[02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:40.320]  I mean, where-
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:41.480]  I do think so.
[02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:43.720]  I don't think they're making production decisions
[02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:48.320]  about the Mac Pro in October of the year it's gonna ship.
[02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:49.160]  Right.
[02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:51.840]  Yeah, they were gonna make that in Texas no matter what.
[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:52.680]  So that-
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:57.240]  And so I worry though that it's gonna embolden Apple
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:02:59.440]  to be like, look, we can muddle through
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:01.240]  and it's all gonna be okay.
[02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:03.840]  And I'm not sure in the long run it's gonna be okay.
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:08.600]  And so there's some really serious decisions
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:10.240]  that Tim Cook is gonna have to make.
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:13.960]  And this is absolutely a CEO level Tim Cook decision.
[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:16.120]  He's the one that got him into China in the first place.
[02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:17.160]  And if they need to get out,
[02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:18.880]  he's the one that needs to get them out.
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:22.100]  And it's gonna be really tempting to say,
[02:03:22.100 --> 02:03:23.640]  this is all gonna blow over.
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:25.040]  It's gonna be fine.
[02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:26.600]  And I don't know.
[02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:28.200]  I don't know if it's gonna be fine.
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:31.020]  It's interesting that Samsung is now out of China.
[02:03:31.020 --> 02:03:33.840]  I mean, and I guess it does,
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:37.120]  the two sides of the coin go hand in hand
[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:38.920]  in a way that I don't quite understand
[02:03:38.920 --> 02:03:41.600]  that people are, at least people are drawing the connection
[02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:45.040]  where China or Samsung at one point had 15%,
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:46.200]  just like six years ago,
[02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:48.660]  had 15% of the Chinese phone market.
[02:03:48.660 --> 02:03:52.440]  And with the rise of the,
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:56.620]  in China brands like Huawei and what's the other one?
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:03:59.160]  Z or what?
[02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:00.840]  Apo, ZTE.
[02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:02.040]  Apo, yeah, there's a couple,
[02:04:02.040 --> 02:04:04.400]  but there's a couple of up and coming companies
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:06.160]  making a truly impressive-
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:07.000]  Xiaomi of course.
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.360]  Yeah, Xiaomi is the one I was thinking of.
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:13.760]  You know, well-regarded high-end hardware within,
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:16.800]  and those companies have eaten Samsung's lunch.
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:20.760]  Samsung is under 1%, effectively zero in the Chinese market.
[02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:23.200]  And they've now, just this week,
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:25.780]  pulled out of China for all assembly and manufacturing.
[02:04:25.780 --> 02:04:27.940]  So it's obvious, you know,
[02:04:27.940 --> 02:04:30.540]  the interesting part of that to me is like,
[02:04:30.540 --> 02:04:32.600]  it's proof that a company,
[02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:35.880]  Samsung makes more phones than Apple per year.
[02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:40.480]  So obviously it's possible to make 100 million phones
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:42.760]  without making a single one of them in China.
[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:46.200]  But it's again-
[02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:47.020]  That's a great point.
[02:04:47.020 --> 02:04:47.860]  That's a great point.
[02:04:47.860 --> 02:04:48.880]  And it's mostly in South Korea, but yeah,
[02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:49.720]  it's a great point.
[02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:50.560]  Well, it's, you know, see,
[02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:52.800]  it's not like China alone can do it, you know,
[02:04:52.800 --> 02:04:54.840]  but it's not, again, like you said,
[02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:57.440]  it's, you know, to borrow a Chinese proverb,
[02:04:57.440 --> 02:05:00.400]  a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:02.640]  It's not like all of a sudden Apple can snap its fingers
[02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:05.640]  and make all of its phones outside China next year.
[02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:06.980]  This would take years.
[02:05:06.980 --> 02:05:10.240]  This is a long, long thing if they're gonna do it.
[02:05:10.240 --> 02:05:14.200]  Anyway, the other news this week was a, you know,
[02:05:14.200 --> 02:05:15.040]  there's these protests,
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:17.200]  democracy protests in Hong Kong,
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:21.360]  the politics of which we don't have to touch upon,
[02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:24.560]  but you know, it's certainly interesting.
[02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:26.040]  It's been months long.
[02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:27.780]  It is certainly significant.
[02:05:27.780 --> 02:05:31.000]  And the Apple angle is that there is an app,
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:34.720]  a service called HK Map Live.
[02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:40.880]  And basically it is a map that shows police activity
[02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:45.880]  and other information that apparently is very useful
[02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:49.800]  for people, even people, not just for the protesters,
[02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:53.760]  it's useful for people who are trying to avoid the protests.
[02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:55.880]  And there are, you know, it's all sorts of stuff.
[02:05:55.880 --> 02:05:57.480]  It's useful information.
[02:05:57.480 --> 02:06:00.800]  They have an app that they, it's available for Android.
[02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:02.620]  They submitted it to Apple
[02:06:02.620 --> 02:06:06.020]  and Apple's app store review process rejected it
[02:06:06.020 --> 02:06:10.000]  on the grounds that it was, I forget the exact words,
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.320]  but basically that Apple accused it
[02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:14.360]  of trying to circumvent law enforcement,
[02:06:14.360 --> 02:06:16.540]  which really does not seem to be the case.
[02:06:16.540 --> 02:06:19.440]  I mean, and again, maybe some of these politics
[02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:20.920]  are such that they, you know,
[02:06:20.920 --> 02:06:22.840]  because the Hong Kong protesters
[02:06:22.840 --> 02:06:24.140]  are on the side of democracy.
[02:06:24.140 --> 02:06:27.760]  And then the other side is the Chinese communist dictatorship
[02:06:27.760 --> 02:06:29.280]  that Apple should allow it anyway.
[02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:30.960]  But it really just, it's just information.
[02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:35.040]  It's effectively, you know, like traffic, you know,
[02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:37.720]  that this police activity is a real thing.
[02:06:37.720 --> 02:06:39.520]  The police don't even want people, you know,
[02:06:39.520 --> 02:06:41.120]  in some regards, I don't even think the police
[02:06:41.120 --> 02:06:42.320]  would object to this app.
[02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:45.480]  It's not, it just seems very,
[02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:48.680]  it seems like a very strange wrongheaded rejection.
[02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:51.600]  And it raises the question, the obvious question, you know,
[02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:53.560]  a lot of people seem to jump to the conclusion
[02:06:53.560 --> 02:06:57.320]  that Apple rejected it, it's for lack of a better word,
[02:06:57.320 --> 02:07:00.040]  kowtowing to the Chinese government that it's,
[02:07:00.040 --> 02:07:02.120]  they just don't want to have anything
[02:07:02.120 --> 02:07:03.640]  that looks like Apple is siding
[02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:06.340]  with the protesters in Hong Kong.
[02:07:06.340 --> 02:07:10.620]  I think, you know, again, the Hanlon's razor argument
[02:07:10.620 --> 02:07:12.020]  that never attributed to malice,
[02:07:12.020 --> 02:07:14.180]  that which can be attributed to stupidity
[02:07:14.180 --> 02:07:18.060]  often is the case with the app store, unfortunately.
[02:07:18.060 --> 02:07:21.620]  So I, you know, and even the HK map developer
[02:07:21.620 --> 02:07:23.540]  seems to think that might be the case, you know,
[02:07:23.540 --> 02:07:25.820]  that, you know, give it, give Apple a couple of days
[02:07:25.820 --> 02:07:28.060]  to relook at this and maybe it'll go through.
[02:07:29.500 --> 02:07:34.180]  But it just, Apple can't screw up stuff like this
[02:07:34.180 --> 02:07:35.180]  with China, right?
[02:07:35.180 --> 02:07:37.380]  It's, of course, it's a reasonable,
[02:07:37.380 --> 02:07:39.220]  it's perfectly reasonable for people
[02:07:39.220 --> 02:07:40.260]  to jump to the conclusion
[02:07:40.260 --> 02:07:41.860]  that Apple is doing this for politics,
[02:07:41.860 --> 02:07:45.300]  not for some kind of bureaucratic snafu
[02:07:45.300 --> 02:07:46.420]  within the app store process
[02:07:46.420 --> 02:07:48.180]  that could have happened to any app.
[02:07:49.620 --> 02:07:53.300]  It's a fair point, but I do think, I mean, frankly,
[02:07:53.300 --> 02:07:57.740]  I don't know why there's any reason to give Apple
[02:07:57.740 --> 02:08:00.060]  the benefit of the doubt with anything China related
[02:08:00.060 --> 02:08:01.700]  other than sort of our hope
[02:08:01.700 --> 02:08:03.380]  that they're gonna do the right thing.
[02:08:03.380 --> 02:08:05.460]  Because the reality is, is every time
[02:08:05.460 --> 02:08:06.940]  they've had to make a decision,
[02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:09.500]  whether it be pulling VPN apps out of the app store
[02:08:09.500 --> 02:08:10.820]  or things on those lines,
[02:08:10.820 --> 02:08:13.300]  they've done what China wanted them to do.
[02:08:13.300 --> 02:08:16.180]  And to be totally clear, I've defended them on that.
[02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:17.700]  Like, that's the reality
[02:08:17.700 --> 02:08:19.460]  of being a multinational corporation
[02:08:19.460 --> 02:08:20.780]  and being in different countries
[02:08:20.780 --> 02:08:22.820]  is you have to follow the law in those countries.
[02:08:22.820 --> 02:08:25.980]  So this isn't a condemnation of them.
[02:08:25.980 --> 02:08:30.980]  But I, you know, the reality is,
[02:08:30.980 --> 02:08:35.420]  is maybe this is the cynic in me,
[02:08:35.420 --> 02:08:39.900]  but I have a hard time seeing Apple pushing back on China
[02:08:39.900 --> 02:08:41.780]  in any sort of meaningful way.
[02:08:41.780 --> 02:08:43.780]  If China doesn't want this app,
[02:08:43.780 --> 02:08:45.700]  I don't think this app is gonna be in the app store.
[02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:47.980]  And yeah, maybe it is Helen's razor.
[02:08:47.980 --> 02:08:49.860]  I'd like to propose Thompson's razor,
[02:08:49.860 --> 02:08:53.260]  which is that this shit's super complicated, right?
[02:08:53.260 --> 02:08:55.620]  And like, oh, you see this again and again,
[02:08:55.620 --> 02:08:58.020]  whether it's Apple or Facebook or Google
[02:08:58.020 --> 02:08:59.900]  or all of these companies,
[02:08:59.900 --> 02:09:03.340]  anytime you think that a decision a company makes
[02:09:03.340 --> 02:09:07.620]  is absolutely 100% wrong or absolutely 100% right,
[02:09:07.620 --> 02:09:10.060]  you almost by definition have not fully thought through
[02:09:10.060 --> 02:09:13.820]  all the trade-offs and the issues that are at hand.
[02:09:13.820 --> 02:09:17.860]  Cause almost all these decisions are like 51-49 decisions.
[02:09:17.860 --> 02:09:20.380]  And it's like, it goes back and forth.
[02:09:20.380 --> 02:09:22.740]  And I don't envy Apple in this situation.
[02:09:22.740 --> 02:09:26.100]  I don't envy them being in the middle,
[02:09:26.100 --> 02:09:29.540]  but I do really hope that they're thinking about ways
[02:09:29.540 --> 02:09:32.500]  to not be in the middle sort of in five to 10 years from now.
[02:09:32.500 --> 02:09:34.100]  Yeah, I guess that's my point is that
[02:09:34.100 --> 02:09:35.540]  I don't think Apple deserves the benefit
[02:09:35.540 --> 02:09:36.380]  of the doubt on this.
[02:09:36.380 --> 02:09:38.260]  I think, you know, and it's not like China
[02:09:38.260 --> 02:09:43.260]  is some obscure country, you know, like if it were,
[02:09:43.420 --> 02:09:47.540]  if it were, you know, there was some weird law in Ecuador
[02:09:47.540 --> 02:09:49.460]  and there's an app and it's like,
[02:09:49.460 --> 02:09:50.740]  oh, that's a really strange law
[02:09:50.740 --> 02:09:53.900]  that seems contrary to the values of, you know, Apple.
[02:09:55.180 --> 02:09:58.260]  You could see how maybe, you know, that wouldn't have,
[02:09:58.260 --> 02:10:00.620]  that might be overlooked in the app store.
[02:10:00.620 --> 02:10:02.940]  Like China is not, you can't overlook China.
[02:10:02.940 --> 02:10:05.980]  I mean, it's the most populous country in the world.
[02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:10.980]  Everybody knows that Apple's in a weird situation there.
[02:10:11.420 --> 02:10:14.140]  It absolutely, there's no way to excuse
[02:10:14.140 --> 02:10:15.820]  if this was a mistake that,
[02:10:15.820 --> 02:10:19.540]  so either way it makes Apple look bad, right?
[02:10:19.540 --> 02:10:21.980]  If they're doing it to kowtow to the Chinese government,
[02:10:21.980 --> 02:10:23.020]  that's a bad look.
[02:10:23.020 --> 02:10:26.460]  And it seems contrary to Apple's rhetoric on privacy
[02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:31.340]  and Apple's stance on various social issues.
[02:10:31.340 --> 02:10:35.420]  And if it happened through ineptitude,
[02:10:35.420 --> 02:10:37.900]  well, that doesn't make Apple that look good either.
[02:10:37.900 --> 02:10:39.340]  How in the world can you be inept
[02:10:39.340 --> 02:10:41.500]  on a decision related to China
[02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:45.420]  and something as high profile as these Hong Kong protests?
[02:10:45.420 --> 02:10:47.180]  Oh, let me tell you about the last 10 years
[02:10:47.180 --> 02:10:48.020]  of the app store.
[02:10:48.020 --> 02:10:51.860]  All right, I have one more sponsor break.
[02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:53.260]  This is a bonus, fourth sponsor
[02:10:53.260 --> 02:10:55.100]  because I only had two shows in September.
[02:10:55.100 --> 02:10:56.340]  And it's also a new sponsor.
[02:10:56.340 --> 02:10:58.260]  I'm very, very happy about this.
[02:10:58.260 --> 02:10:59.780]  It's a new product.
[02:10:59.780 --> 02:11:02.780]  It is called Feals, F-E-A-L-S.
[02:11:02.780 --> 02:11:03.780]  What is it?
[02:11:03.780 --> 02:11:08.260]  It is premium CBD delivered directly to your doorstop.
[02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:10.820]  Feals naturally helps reduce stress,
[02:11:10.820 --> 02:11:13.380]  anxiety, pain, and sleeplessness.
[02:11:13.380 --> 02:11:16.660]  You just place a few drops of Feals under your tongue
[02:11:16.660 --> 02:11:18.820]  and you feel the difference within minutes.
[02:11:18.820 --> 02:11:20.300]  Are you new to CBD?
[02:11:20.300 --> 02:11:25.300]  Feals offers a free CBD hotline and text message support,
[02:11:25.300 --> 02:11:27.020]  which is great because if you're like me
[02:11:27.020 --> 02:11:29.700]  and you'd rather text somebody with questions
[02:11:29.700 --> 02:11:32.420]  rather than actually talk to them on the phone,
[02:11:32.420 --> 02:11:33.420]  they've got that too.
[02:11:33.420 --> 02:11:35.820]  And they can help guide your personal experience.
[02:11:35.820 --> 02:11:37.940]  Feals works naturally to help you feel better.
[02:11:37.940 --> 02:11:40.820]  There's no high, no hangover, no addiction.
[02:11:40.820 --> 02:11:43.340]  This is not like with THC.
[02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:44.460]  So it's legal too.
[02:11:44.460 --> 02:11:46.180]  You don't have to worry about that.
[02:11:47.180 --> 02:11:49.100]  Join the Feals community, get a membership
[02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:51.860]  and you get Feals delivered to your door every month.
[02:11:51.860 --> 02:11:53.420]  You'll save money on every order

[02:11:55.580 --> 02:12:00.580]  Go to Feals.com, F-E-A-L-S, F-E-A-L-S.com slash talk show

[02:12:06.140 --> 02:12:07.860]  with free shipping.

[02:12:11.820 --> 02:12:14.900]  and you get 50% automatically taken off your first order.
[02:12:14.900 --> 02:12:16.940]  That is like the biggest discount I can recall
[02:12:16.940 --> 02:12:18.980]  on a podcast sponsorship in a long time.
[02:12:18.980 --> 02:12:20.580]  Feals.com slash talk show.
[02:12:20.580 --> 02:12:22.940]  Talk show, try it yourself.
[02:12:24.940 --> 02:12:26.340]  All right, charcoal's on the list.
[02:12:26.340 --> 02:12:27.180]  Anything else?
[02:12:28.660 --> 02:12:30.860]  We're here for charcoal.
[02:12:30.860 --> 02:12:32.980]  Let me double check that there's nothing else real
[02:12:32.980 --> 02:12:35.260]  on my agenda for this show.
[02:12:37.260 --> 02:12:38.940]  No, I think that's about it.
[02:12:38.940 --> 02:12:43.300]  I want the minute by minute breakdown
[02:12:43.300 --> 02:12:44.380]  because as I understand it,
[02:12:44.380 --> 02:12:45.540]  you're the one that answered the door.
[02:12:45.540 --> 02:12:46.500]  Is that correct?
[02:12:46.500 --> 02:12:50.780]  Yeah, well, so we have a roof deck,
[02:12:50.780 --> 02:12:52.340]  we have a charcoal grill.
[02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:54.820]  No, no, no, no, I want the door opening.
[02:12:54.820 --> 02:12:57.780]  Then we can backtrack and give context here.
[02:12:57.780 --> 02:13:00.660]  Well, we've been out of charcoal for a couple of weeks
[02:13:00.660 --> 02:13:02.300]  and you live in the city
[02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:04.140]  and I could buy it at the corner store,
[02:13:04.140 --> 02:13:07.540]  but the amount of charcoal you can buy
[02:13:07.540 --> 02:13:09.620]  and walk home with is not a lot.
[02:13:09.620 --> 02:13:13.220]  So I mentioned it to Amy and I said,
[02:13:13.220 --> 02:13:14.580]  we should Amazon some charcoal.
[02:13:14.580 --> 02:13:15.980]  That's what we should do.
[02:13:15.980 --> 02:13:17.540]  And she said that she would take care of it.
[02:13:17.540 --> 02:13:19.620]  And then she said, charcoal's on the way.
[02:13:20.540 --> 02:13:23.660]  And what was it, Tuesday, two days ago, three days ago,
[02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:26.540]  it was actually, part of it was,
[02:13:26.540 --> 02:13:28.300]  it's early October in Philadelphia,
[02:13:28.300 --> 02:13:30.500]  but it was over 90 degrees.
[02:13:30.500 --> 02:13:32.820]  It was, we had a very hot streak.
[02:13:32.820 --> 02:13:34.540]  Doorbell rings and there's a man,
[02:13:34.540 --> 02:13:38.180]  he's a very large man and he was sweating profusely.
[02:13:39.660 --> 02:13:42.980]  He's carrying what looks to be a very heavy box.
[02:13:42.980 --> 02:13:45.980]  I would say it's, I don't know,
[02:13:45.980 --> 02:13:48.620]  almost like a chest size cardboard box.
[02:13:50.220 --> 02:13:52.340]  And behind you're like, wow, that's a lot of charcoal.
[02:13:52.340 --> 02:13:55.660]  Well, and behind him is a,
[02:13:55.660 --> 02:13:57.980]  you know those hand trucks they have at the airport?
[02:13:57.980 --> 02:13:59.940]  Like if you come to the airport with a lot of,
[02:13:59.940 --> 02:14:02.100]  like you're going with your whole family on a long trip
[02:14:02.100 --> 02:14:04.220]  and there's a curbside porter
[02:14:04.220 --> 02:14:06.700]  who will take your luggage with him.
[02:14:06.700 --> 02:14:07.820]  It's like a push cart.
[02:14:07.820 --> 02:14:08.980]  It's got like four wheels on it.
[02:14:08.980 --> 02:14:10.820]  Four wheels and a push cart.
[02:14:10.820 --> 02:14:13.860]  And it could take maybe a family of sixes luggage
[02:14:13.860 --> 02:14:16.260]  to the check-in counter.
[02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:17.900]  He's got one of those behind it.
[02:14:17.900 --> 02:14:22.460]  Also just stuffed with six boxes like this.
[02:14:22.460 --> 02:14:25.740]  And then he's got a colleague behind him in the street
[02:14:27.100 --> 02:14:30.140]  with another push cart with six similar boxes.
[02:14:31.380 --> 02:14:35.220]  And he hands me the first box and it is very heavy.
[02:14:36.220 --> 02:14:38.420]  I can tell you, I actually opened it up and checked.
[02:14:38.420 --> 02:14:42.460]  It is, it weighs 36 pounds each box.
[02:14:44.460 --> 02:14:45.780]  And I guess-
[02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:47.300]  Do you have 12 boxes?
[02:14:47.300 --> 02:14:48.380]  Is that right?
[02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:50.780]  12 boxes, each of them, 36 pounds.
[02:14:50.780 --> 02:14:55.300]  So it's 432 pounds of charcoal.
[02:14:55.300 --> 02:14:57.020]  I guessed right away that it was charcoal.
[02:14:57.020 --> 02:14:58.740]  I had no idea why it was so much.
[02:14:58.740 --> 02:14:59.940]  And I thought, well, maybe.
[02:14:59.940 --> 02:15:01.380]  And then I thought,
[02:15:01.380 --> 02:15:03.740]  I realized that the first six boxes were definitely mine.
[02:15:03.740 --> 02:15:07.340]  The fellow behind him, I actually asked,
[02:15:07.340 --> 02:15:09.900]  I asked, I said, is that mine too?
[02:15:09.900 --> 02:15:11.380]  Cause I, in my mind,
[02:15:11.380 --> 02:15:13.820]  I thought we can't possibly have this much charcoal.
[02:15:13.820 --> 02:15:14.660]  And I thought, well,
[02:15:14.660 --> 02:15:16.060]  somebody else must've bought a lot of charcoal.
[02:15:16.060 --> 02:15:17.740]  And as soon as the words came out of my mouth,
[02:15:17.740 --> 02:15:18.580]  I realized, well,
[02:15:18.580 --> 02:15:21.740]  what are the odds that somebody else in my neighborhood-
[02:15:21.740 --> 02:15:26.740]  About six large boxes, about 216 pounds of charcoal.
[02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:29.260]  I, as soon as the words came out of my mouth,
[02:15:29.260 --> 02:15:30.940]  I realized it was maybe the dumbest thing
[02:15:30.940 --> 02:15:32.380]  I've said in months.
[02:15:32.380 --> 02:15:37.380]  And he goes, no, that's yours too, buddy.
[02:15:37.580 --> 02:15:39.140]  Did he actually drop the buddy?
[02:15:39.140 --> 02:15:40.220]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:15:40.220 --> 02:15:44.740]  And he says, we've got more on the truck for you.
[02:15:44.740 --> 02:15:45.700]  And I was like, more charcoal.
[02:15:45.700 --> 02:15:47.260]  I goes, nah, it's other stuff.
[02:15:48.620 --> 02:15:50.940]  Cause I thought, oh my God, there's more.
[02:15:50.940 --> 02:15:55.100]  So somehow my wife wound up buying
[02:15:55.100 --> 02:15:58.460]  432 pounds of charcoal from Amazon.
[02:15:58.460 --> 02:16:02.860]  And she thinks what happened is that she,
[02:16:02.860 --> 02:16:04.340]  it sounds like a good theory.
[02:16:06.700 --> 02:16:08.300]  Well, number one, I opened a box.
[02:16:08.300 --> 02:16:10.740]  It's Kingsford charcoal.
[02:16:10.740 --> 02:16:12.660]  It's not just any bag though.
[02:16:12.660 --> 02:16:15.460]  It is their new 18 pound bags
[02:16:15.460 --> 02:16:18.500]  that they are advertising as their biggest ever.
[02:16:18.500 --> 02:16:20.860]  So each bag, it's not just bags of charcoal.
[02:16:20.860 --> 02:16:23.020]  It is the biggest bags of charcoal
[02:16:23.020 --> 02:16:24.340]  that Kingsford has ever sold.
[02:16:24.340 --> 02:16:29.020]  Each box contains two of them.
[02:16:29.020 --> 02:16:32.420]  She thinks what happened is that she started buying it
[02:16:32.420 --> 02:16:36.300]  on one of her, like maybe her iPad,
[02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:38.620]  maybe her Mac or whatever.
[02:16:38.620 --> 02:16:40.940]  But she didn't finish the transaction.
[02:16:40.940 --> 02:16:45.780]  She bought one, meaning one two pack,
[02:16:45.780 --> 02:16:48.940]  which would be a combined 36 pounds of charcoal.
[02:16:50.260 --> 02:16:51.100]  Which is very sensible.
[02:16:51.100 --> 02:16:52.660]  You go in the city, it's hard to get charcoal.
[02:16:52.660 --> 02:16:54.340]  You get a bunch of charcoal at once.
[02:16:54.340 --> 02:16:55.700]  That would be a fine amount.
[02:16:55.700 --> 02:16:58.100]  Kingsford advertises that one of these bags,
[02:16:58.100 --> 02:17:02.700]  one of these 18 pound bags is enough for nine grillings.
[02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:07.220]  And that she went to a next device and thought,
[02:17:07.220 --> 02:17:08.700]  you know what, why don't I buy two?
[02:17:08.700 --> 02:17:10.380]  Cause then we'll be set for a while.
[02:17:10.380 --> 02:17:13.100]  And that on her iPad, on the Amazon website,
[02:17:13.100 --> 02:17:15.620]  it's not a pop-up menu for quantity.
[02:17:15.620 --> 02:17:16.700]  It's a text field.
[02:17:16.700 --> 02:17:20.540]  And that she poked it and typed a two.
[02:17:20.540 --> 02:17:23.020]  And that turned, instead of changing to two,
[02:17:23.020 --> 02:17:25.020]  it changed one to 12.
[02:17:25.020 --> 02:17:27.020]  This actually makes perfect sense.
[02:17:27.020 --> 02:17:28.780]  I believe that she has nailed the,
[02:17:28.780 --> 02:17:30.740]  how in the fuck did this happen?
[02:17:31.820 --> 02:17:34.700]  I forget which device is which,
[02:17:34.700 --> 02:17:36.860]  but that she started it on one, went to the other,
[02:17:36.860 --> 02:17:39.500]  and on the other, it's a text field,
[02:17:39.500 --> 02:17:41.220]  not a pop-up for quantity.
[02:17:41.220 --> 02:17:44.580]  And she changed one to 12 instead of one to two,
[02:17:44.580 --> 02:17:47.820]  and just banged her way through,
[02:17:47.820 --> 02:17:49.980]  one clicked her way through the whole process
[02:17:49.980 --> 02:17:54.980]  and bought $240 or something worth of charcoal.
[02:17:55.020 --> 02:17:57.820]  So now we have 400.
[02:17:57.820 --> 02:18:00.740]  So what are you gonna do with all the charcoal?
[02:18:02.460 --> 02:18:04.940]  I don't, I really don't know.
[02:18:08.780 --> 02:18:10.900]  There needs to be like odds in Vegas
[02:18:10.900 --> 02:18:14.780]  on the chances of this charcoal still being in your house,
[02:18:14.780 --> 02:18:16.500]  like four years from now.
[02:18:16.500 --> 02:18:19.580]  Now, the other funny thing, my wife owned up to it.
[02:18:19.580 --> 02:18:20.620]  Well, sort of.
[02:18:20.620 --> 02:18:22.500]  I mean, she tweeted by saying,
[02:18:22.500 --> 02:18:26.820]  let he who has not ordered 432 pounds of charcoal
[02:18:26.820 --> 02:18:28.660]  cast the first stone or something like that.
[02:18:28.660 --> 02:18:30.940]  And my reply to her was, he?
[02:18:31.940 --> 02:18:34.700]  Because there was no he who ordered,
[02:18:34.700 --> 02:18:36.300]  inadvertently ordered all of this.
[02:18:36.300 --> 02:18:37.940]  And she posted a picture.
[02:18:37.940 --> 02:18:39.260]  My response to her was to link
[02:18:39.260 --> 02:18:40.460]  to that New York Times article
[02:18:40.460 --> 02:18:42.900]  about how it actually may not be a problem
[02:18:42.900 --> 02:18:44.140]  to eat lots of red meat.
[02:18:45.220 --> 02:18:47.100]  That was good news, good timing.
[02:18:47.100 --> 02:18:49.100]  Well, if Kingsford is correct
[02:18:49.100 --> 02:18:53.300]  that each bag is good for nine grillings,
[02:18:53.300 --> 02:18:54.900]  and you would think that,
[02:18:54.900 --> 02:18:56.860]  much like the way that the toothpaste industry
[02:18:56.860 --> 02:18:59.500]  would have you believe that you should put
[02:18:59.500 --> 02:19:02.300]  like a big S-shaped longer than your toothbrush
[02:19:02.300 --> 02:19:04.820]  amount of toothpaste on your toothbrush
[02:19:04.820 --> 02:19:06.220]  each time you brush your teeth,
[02:19:06.220 --> 02:19:08.500]  I would imagine the Kingsford people encourage you
[02:19:08.500 --> 02:19:10.940]  to use plenty of charcoal each time you grill.
[02:19:10.940 --> 02:19:12.900]  Yeah, that's like you burn through all the charcoal,
[02:19:12.900 --> 02:19:14.300]  like there's no reuse or anything.
[02:19:14.300 --> 02:19:16.700]  Right, so let's assume that they're accurate
[02:19:16.700 --> 02:19:19.340]  with their nine grillings per bag.
[02:19:19.340 --> 02:19:23.820]  With 24 bags, it would be nine times 24
[02:19:23.820 --> 02:19:28.820]  would be what, 180 plus 36 would be 216, 216 grillings?
[02:19:32.060 --> 02:19:33.380]  Am I doing the math right?
[02:19:34.340 --> 02:19:36.060]  That's a lot of grillings.
[02:19:37.380 --> 02:19:38.860]  So I think we're set.
[02:19:38.860 --> 02:19:41.380]  I think that you started talking
[02:19:41.380 --> 02:19:42.460]  about the number of grillings
[02:19:42.460 --> 02:19:44.660]  and you expected that number to be much smaller,
[02:19:44.660 --> 02:19:47.220]  and then you actually calculate it and you realize
[02:19:47.220 --> 02:19:51.740]  it's literally like eight months worth of grillings.
[02:19:53.180 --> 02:19:56.860]  If we grilled every single day, which we don't do,
[02:19:56.860 --> 02:19:58.460]  and it's gonna be winter soon.
[02:20:00.660 --> 02:20:03.220]  7.2 months, I believe is the exact number.
[02:20:03.220 --> 02:20:05.020]  I guess if we were smart people,
[02:20:05.020 --> 02:20:06.780]  we'd send it back somehow,
[02:20:06.780 --> 02:20:11.780]  but it just seems embarrassing as well to have.
[02:20:11.780 --> 02:20:16.780]  I don't even know how you send back 430 pounds of charcoal,
[02:20:16.860 --> 02:20:19.140]  or I guess we'd keep some of it,
[02:20:19.140 --> 02:20:21.780]  just send back 380 pounds of it or something.
[02:20:24.580 --> 02:20:26.940]  Anyway, my wife also, she did own up to it.
[02:20:26.940 --> 02:20:29.380]  She posted a picture with our son standing
[02:20:29.380 --> 02:20:33.180]  in front of all 12 boxes for size.
[02:20:34.740 --> 02:20:35.980]  They are large boxes.
[02:20:35.980 --> 02:20:37.240]  They are large boxes.
[02:20:37.240 --> 02:20:39.100]  They are 36 pounds each.
[02:20:39.100 --> 02:20:42.820]  And the odd thing was that the most common response
[02:20:42.820 --> 02:20:44.060]  that she got after tweeting it
[02:20:44.060 --> 02:20:48.420]  was the boxes all say Walmart, but that's just fulfillment.
[02:20:48.420 --> 02:20:50.340]  And people were giving her a hard time
[02:20:50.340 --> 02:20:54.000]  for shopping at Walmart as though that's morally,
[02:20:55.420 --> 02:20:58.540]  I don't understand the people who gave her a hard time
[02:20:58.540 --> 02:21:00.740]  about having purchased them from Walmart,
[02:21:00.740 --> 02:21:02.620]  which A, I wouldn't have had a problem with,
[02:21:02.620 --> 02:21:03.780]  I don't think there's anything wrong
[02:21:03.780 --> 02:21:05.620]  with buying charcoal from Walmart,
[02:21:05.620 --> 02:21:06.900]  but B, she didn't even do it.
[02:21:06.900 --> 02:21:08.460]  She bought it from Amazon and Walmart
[02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:10.140]  just happened to fulfill it,
[02:21:10.140 --> 02:21:13.060]  the weird way that Amazon is just sort of a front end
[02:21:13.060 --> 02:21:15.020]  to retail stuff these days.
[02:21:15.020 --> 02:21:19.460]  But more than that, the issue of buying it from Walmart
[02:21:19.460 --> 02:21:22.860]  isn't the issue, it's 432 fucking pounds of charcoal
[02:21:22.860 --> 02:21:24.340]  in my office.
[02:21:24.340 --> 02:21:27.300]  Why are you obsessing about the logo on the box?
[02:21:27.300 --> 02:21:30.260]  The fact is there are 12 boxes here
[02:21:30.260 --> 02:21:34.700]  with each containing two 18-pound bags of charcoal.
[02:21:34.700 --> 02:21:39.700]  It's a lot of charcoal.
[02:21:40.180 --> 02:21:42.860]  So anyway, do you need some charcoal?
[02:21:42.860 --> 02:21:45.340]  I think it's not gonna be worth the price
[02:21:45.340 --> 02:21:46.740]  to ship it to Taiwan.
[02:21:46.740 --> 02:21:51.180]  I guess, but maybe we'll give it out at Christmas to people.
[02:21:51.180 --> 02:21:53.220]  You'll get a container ship.
[02:21:53.220 --> 02:21:54.460]  That would be hilarious.
[02:21:54.460 --> 02:21:57.300]  You gotta start mailing out the, what are they, 18 pounds?
[02:21:57.300 --> 02:21:58.260]  Yeah.
[02:21:58.260 --> 02:22:00.260]  Just, you should start soon
[02:22:00.260 --> 02:22:02.140]  because you want to use like UPS ground or something
[02:22:02.140 --> 02:22:05.500]  or whatever the cheap US Postal Service service is.
[02:22:05.500 --> 02:22:08.140]  And just pick a bunch of friends
[02:22:08.140 --> 02:22:10.220]  and just start mailing them bags of charcoal
[02:22:10.220 --> 02:22:12.100]  and all of them are gonna laugh their ass off.
[02:22:12.100 --> 02:22:13.900]  It's absolutely what you should do.
[02:22:15.380 --> 02:22:16.620]  You're gonna spend way more
[02:22:16.620 --> 02:22:17.940]  than you spend the charcoal in the first place,
[02:22:17.940 --> 02:22:19.300]  but it'll be worth it.
[02:22:19.300 --> 02:22:20.260]  I don't know what it would cost
[02:22:20.260 --> 02:22:22.100]  to mail 36 pounds of charcoal.
[02:22:22.100 --> 02:22:24.220]  The hilarious thing is you're gonna mail this charcoal out
[02:22:24.220 --> 02:22:26.620]  and then it's gonna get to like May.
[02:22:26.620 --> 02:22:29.660]  You're gonna be like, fuck, I have no more charcoal.
[02:22:29.660 --> 02:22:32.860]  If I ever do run out of charcoal, I've gotta be upset.
[02:22:32.860 --> 02:22:35.060]  I guess the good news is charcoal doesn't go bad.
[02:22:35.060 --> 02:22:38.020]  I guess keep it dry and it should be fine.
[02:22:38.020 --> 02:22:38.940]  My wife was worried then.
[02:22:38.940 --> 02:22:39.780]  My wife got spooked.
[02:22:39.780 --> 02:22:44.500]  She worried if it was a fire hazard.
[02:22:44.500 --> 02:22:46.500]  And I said, well, think about how hard it is
[02:22:46.500 --> 02:22:47.780]  to light charcoal, really.
[02:22:47.780 --> 02:22:50.860]  I mean, it's actually notoriously tricky.
[02:22:50.860 --> 02:22:54.900]  That's why they, and it's not match light charcoal,
[02:22:54.900 --> 02:22:56.620]  which is pre-doused with lighter fluid.
[02:22:56.620 --> 02:22:59.660]  It is just plain old-fashioned charcoal-
[02:22:59.660 --> 02:23:00.500]  The original.
[02:23:00.500 --> 02:23:01.340]  The original.
[02:23:01.340 --> 02:23:02.180]  Yes.
[02:23:02.180 --> 02:23:03.540]  So I said, I don't think it's a fire hazard
[02:23:03.540 --> 02:23:06.380]  given how tricky it usually is to get it going.
[02:23:06.380 --> 02:23:08.580]  So I don't think we're in danger.
[02:23:11.140 --> 02:23:14.380]  Well, I look forward to visiting your house in 2027
[02:23:14.380 --> 02:23:18.860]  and using this shipment of charcoal.
[02:23:18.860 --> 02:23:20.100]  It really was.
[02:23:20.100 --> 02:23:20.940]  And that's the thing.
[02:23:20.940 --> 02:23:23.660]  And the other part too is she tweeted it
[02:23:23.660 --> 02:23:25.100]  and she zoned up to it,
[02:23:25.100 --> 02:23:27.100]  but I wasn't mad at all.
[02:23:27.100 --> 02:23:28.740]  I didn't say a cross word.
[02:23:29.900 --> 02:23:31.300]  To me, it was an honest mistake,
[02:23:31.300 --> 02:23:34.700]  but it gets to the nature of our different personalities
[02:23:34.700 --> 02:23:35.860]  where I said to her,
[02:23:35.860 --> 02:23:40.500]  I want you to imagine if I had accidentally ordered-
[02:23:40.500 --> 02:23:43.180]  432 pounds.
[02:23:43.180 --> 02:23:45.940]  Of charcoal at a cost of over $200
[02:23:47.260 --> 02:23:51.060]  and that you were home alone and had to answer the door
[02:23:51.060 --> 02:23:56.060]  and look this sweaty delivery guy on a 90 degree day
[02:23:56.740 --> 02:23:59.340]  right in the eye and just take ownership
[02:23:59.340 --> 02:24:03.100]  of 12 of these 36 pound boxes of charcoal.
[02:24:03.100 --> 02:24:07.020]  I want you to imagine how you would have reacted to that.
[02:24:07.020 --> 02:24:10.820]  And she admitted that she would have-
[02:24:10.820 --> 02:24:12.060]  She would not have handled it well.
[02:24:12.060 --> 02:24:14.660]  No, well, there would have been cross words.
[02:24:14.660 --> 02:24:15.500]  It's quite a thing.
[02:24:15.500 --> 02:24:18.500]  Anyway, hope you like charcoal.
[02:24:18.500 --> 02:24:21.900]  Ben Thompson, everybody can follow you online
[02:24:21.900 --> 02:24:24.140]  at Ben Thompson on Twitter.
[02:24:24.140 --> 02:24:26.620]  No Tech Ben for your sports commentary,
[02:24:26.620 --> 02:24:28.500]  which NBA is picking up
[02:24:28.500 --> 02:24:30.100]  so you don't have to be too depressed over-
[02:24:30.100 --> 02:24:32.180]  I appreciate you not discussing baseball.
[02:24:32.180 --> 02:24:35.140]  It was a difficult conclusion to the season
[02:24:35.140 --> 02:24:35.980]  to say the least.
[02:24:35.980 --> 02:24:38.460]  It's heartbreaking to be honest.
[02:24:38.460 --> 02:24:40.180]  And I'm going to be honest with you.
[02:24:40.180 --> 02:24:42.020]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[02:24:42.020 --> 02:24:44.700]  It's heartbreaking to be honest.
[02:24:44.700 --> 02:24:48.100]  And of course, Stratechery.com,
[02:24:48.100 --> 02:24:52.260]  your daily newsletter with the weekly updates
[02:24:52.260 --> 02:24:54.860]  and keen insights into everything going on
[02:24:54.860 --> 02:24:56.300]  in the world of tech.
[02:24:56.300 --> 02:24:57.140]  I thank you.
[02:24:57.140 --> 02:24:58.460]  I always love having you on the show.
[02:24:59.580 --> 02:25:01.820]  I love being on the show and I love talking about charcoal.
[02:25:01.820 --> 02:25:05.500]  Yeah, find out how much it costs to send a bag to Taipei.
[02:25:05.500 --> 02:25:12.500]  That'd be 432 bucks.
