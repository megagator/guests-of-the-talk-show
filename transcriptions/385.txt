[00:00.000 --> 00:06.280]  I did the thing where I think maybe, possibly, I was the only iPhone 15 reviewer who didn't
[00:06.280 --> 00:10.460]  post a single photograph with my review.
[00:10.460 --> 00:12.360]  The classic John.
[00:12.360 --> 00:17.660]  I went all in on, I am not going to have time for this.
[00:17.660 --> 00:19.700]  Part of it though, because it's a rush, right?
[00:19.700 --> 00:21.520]  The embargo was Tuesday.
[00:21.520 --> 00:26.600]  I didn't get to set up the phones until Thursday, right?
[00:26.600 --> 00:32.040]  So we were out in California, Tuesday event, Wednesday was travel for me, and I don't want
[00:32.040 --> 00:35.240]  to...
[00:35.240 --> 00:40.280]  In past years I've set up a dummy phone, meaning I'm not transferring all my shit over to it.
[00:40.280 --> 00:41.280]  It's like I can't afford...
[00:41.280 --> 00:43.040]  Just to get it live to mess with it.
[00:43.040 --> 00:44.040]  Right.
[00:44.040 --> 00:48.600]  But I can't afford to move my SIM card over and maybe botch it on a day when I'm flying
[00:48.600 --> 00:50.760]  across the country.
[00:50.760 --> 00:51.760]  And what am I going to do?
[00:51.760 --> 00:52.760]  Take pictures in the airport?
[00:52.760 --> 00:53.760]  I guess you could.
[00:53.760 --> 00:59.320]  A more talented photographer than me can get beautiful photographs at SFO, but I did not.
[00:59.320 --> 01:01.120]  So it's a short period of time.
[01:01.120 --> 01:04.120]  I figure, hey, I know you're going to Disneyland again.
[01:04.120 --> 01:06.880]  So I'm like, well, Matthew's going to cover the photography part.
[01:06.880 --> 01:10.760]  We'll let him do it.
[01:10.760 --> 01:13.080]  Mikey likes it.
[01:13.080 --> 01:16.800]  I did take hundreds, maybe a thousand photos.
[01:16.800 --> 01:21.080]  I don't know about a thousand, but hundreds of photos, lots of videos.
[01:21.080 --> 01:24.720]  I actually captured at one of our parks here in Philly.
[01:24.720 --> 01:32.000]  There was a skater meetup, and in theory, I could have put together...
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.120]  Somebody who is a talented video editor could maybe put together a pretty cool skateboard
[01:36.120 --> 01:37.120]  video.
[01:37.120 --> 01:42.280]  And so I did test it, and I'm like, damn, this camera is good, but I did not publish
[01:42.280 --> 01:45.280]  any.
[01:45.280 --> 01:46.280]  The skateboard...
[01:46.280 --> 01:48.080]  Skate skating's great for iPhone photography.
[01:48.080 --> 01:50.640]  I did that the first year they did slow-mo.
[01:50.640 --> 01:51.640]  I went to the skate park.
[01:51.640 --> 01:52.640]  That was fun.
[01:52.640 --> 01:54.280]  Yeah, I took lots of slow-mo.
[01:54.280 --> 01:55.280]  I don't know.
[01:55.280 --> 01:57.560]  I went in order in my review.
[01:57.560 --> 02:00.320]  I guess we have lots to talk about because I haven't podcasted all month.
[02:00.320 --> 02:04.800]  We could talk about the event, talk about the iPhones, talk about the watches.
[02:04.800 --> 02:07.680]  And then the other thing is we've waited so long to record.
[02:07.680 --> 02:11.480]  We could talk about the fact that the phones have actually started shipping to real people
[02:11.480 --> 02:12.480]  yesterday.
[02:12.480 --> 02:13.480]  Right.
[02:13.480 --> 02:14.480]  Yeah.
[02:14.480 --> 02:15.660]  People started getting them.
[02:15.660 --> 02:16.660]  Lots to cover.
[02:16.660 --> 02:17.960]  I'll just start with this.
[02:17.960 --> 02:20.680]  What is your high-level takeaway?
[02:20.680 --> 02:24.560]  Yeah, so I think I felt pretty good about the event.
[02:24.560 --> 02:28.160]  Just a high-level takeaway, one sentence on each of those components.
[02:28.160 --> 02:35.960]  I felt that the event was solid, but it definitely showed off how distanced the expectation of
[02:35.960 --> 02:43.060]  the events from media is from what they actually deliver now, even more than in recent years.
[02:43.060 --> 02:47.100]  But I thought it was well-executed, and overall, there were no major complaints that I had
[02:47.100 --> 02:52.400]  about how they went about it beyond the high-level like, hey, maybe this thing is different.
[02:52.400 --> 02:59.040]  The second thing is the phones are great, really solid, high-level deliverables across
[02:59.040 --> 03:02.280]  all of the major categories.
[03:02.280 --> 03:09.840]  The watches are pretty much exactly as expected, but really no surprises there much at all.
[03:09.840 --> 03:15.960]  And not even surprises, but no real like, you're not going to buy this watch, I don't
[03:15.960 --> 03:20.000]  think, or should you, if you bought last year's watch at all.
[03:20.000 --> 03:21.880]  And then, what was the last one?
[03:21.880 --> 03:25.000]  Well, they've actually started shipping to customers.
[03:25.000 --> 03:26.000]  Oh yeah, and shipping.
[03:26.000 --> 03:29.080]  Yeah, it looks like shipping times were pretty much as expected.
[03:29.080 --> 03:32.800]  Like the high-end ones slipped a bit, but still relatively available, and I know a lot
[03:32.800 --> 03:35.760]  of people got walk-ins on day one, and yeah.
[03:35.760 --> 03:37.760]  I think it was pretty positive.
[03:37.760 --> 03:41.640]  I ordered, and I just wanted to check it out.
[03:41.640 --> 03:49.040]  So for my personal phone, which we can say what we ordered, I bought the black iPhone
[03:49.040 --> 03:55.760]  15 Pro, not Max, even though my heart, even just saying it hurts a little bit because
[03:55.760 --> 03:58.420]  of the 5X, hurts a little.
[03:58.420 --> 04:02.640]  And when I ordered, I did not wake up at 8 a.m., I was exhausted.
[04:02.640 --> 04:07.480]  I think it was 8 a.m. Eastern, yeah, it was like 8 a.m. Eastern, 5 a.m. Pacific for you
[04:07.480 --> 04:08.680]  poor souls out there.
[04:08.680 --> 04:13.720]  I woke up a little later than that, and by that time, I could not get delivery yesterday,
[04:13.720 --> 04:15.560]  but I could get in-store pickup.
[04:15.560 --> 04:24.040]  Amy wanted the white Pro Max, and by, I don't know, 1030 in the morning or so, it was already
[04:24.040 --> 04:29.640]  like a late October delivery, as has been reported elsewhere, the Pro Maxes are backed
[04:29.640 --> 04:31.680]  up first.
[04:31.680 --> 04:37.500]  I guess it has something to do with the camera, and Ming-Chi Kuo said that there's something
[04:37.500 --> 04:42.680]  something with the component supplier for the Tetra Prism or something, unless the demand
[04:42.680 --> 04:48.440]  is extremely tilted towards the Pro Max mix, and we know that's sort of the most popular
[04:48.440 --> 04:54.120]  one, but unless it's extremely tilted toward that, it makes more sense that it's held
[04:54.120 --> 04:59.640]  up by the one component that's unique, which is the Tetra Prism 5X camera.
[04:59.640 --> 05:00.640]  But it's not bad.
[05:00.640 --> 05:01.640]  Exactly.
[05:01.640 --> 05:04.800]  Your first instinct in years past might have been, oh, it's chips, right?
[05:04.800 --> 05:09.480]  Chips are always the hardest, yield is always the hardest, but the display yield is no joke.
[05:09.480 --> 05:14.080]  The Tetra Prism has to be the biggest limiting factor, just given that they only make these
[05:14.080 --> 05:15.080]  for Apple.
[05:15.080 --> 05:20.600]  They're not making Tetra Prisms for anybody else, they're making them only for Apple.
[05:20.600 --> 05:22.960]  One of the cool things about the event is the mix.
[05:22.960 --> 05:28.160]  I do enjoy it, and most of my friends at the event are people like you and Nilay and Joanna
[05:28.160 --> 05:34.760]  and people in the media side, but the analyst side is always good to talk to, because they're
[05:34.760 --> 05:35.760]  good.
[05:35.760 --> 05:39.680]  They know things other people don't, and talking to a couple of the analysts like Ben
[05:39.680 --> 05:48.120]  Bajarn and a couple other people, the fear over how many three nanometer A17 Pro chips
[05:48.120 --> 05:52.920]  TSMC can produce throughout the course of the year is very real, right?
[05:52.920 --> 05:55.720]  They're skating on the edge.
[05:55.720 --> 06:01.320]  And one of my takeaways on that is, and there are, I don't even know if they're rumors,
[06:01.320 --> 06:08.840]  I almost think that we almost can say for a fact that the A16 last year was originally
[06:08.840 --> 06:11.120]  going to be on three nanometer, right?
[06:11.120 --> 06:17.640]  Like TSMC's three nanometers slipped by, I don't know, 18 months or something like that,
[06:17.640 --> 06:23.280]  you know, and the lead time on this, I mean, who knows where on Gianni Srougi's team, I
[06:23.280 --> 06:26.040]  would assume they're already working on things like the A20.
[06:26.040 --> 06:28.720]  Somebody's in there working years ahead.
[06:28.720 --> 06:29.720]  Charting that out, yeah.
[06:29.720 --> 06:30.720]  Right.
[06:30.720 --> 06:35.400]  And I also think as we go into this era where some of the phones are called Pro and some
[06:35.400 --> 06:38.280]  of them aren't, even though they get the new integer, right?
[06:38.280 --> 06:42.800]  There are iPhone 15s and they are new and they offer some really cool features, but
[06:42.800 --> 06:47.880]  as they segment the difference between Pro and non-Pro more, I can't help but think that
[06:47.880 --> 06:52.920]  this three nanometer production issue is one of the reasons why last year, even though
[06:52.920 --> 06:57.880]  the A16 was still five nanometer, they're like, let's split it on the chip too.
[06:57.880 --> 07:03.760]  Specifically, it's wafer production, I think, that is really a limiter there because there's
[07:03.760 --> 07:05.080]  only so many people that can make them.
[07:05.080 --> 07:08.440]  There's only so many that can be produced every year and that's it.
[07:08.440 --> 07:09.440]  That's all you have, right?
[07:09.440 --> 07:13.400]  And you have to kind of like figure out your mix, which is why they probably could have
[07:13.400 --> 07:15.000]  charged a lot more for the bigger ones.
[07:15.000 --> 07:16.000]  Right.
[07:16.000 --> 07:17.000]  Yeah.
[07:17.000 --> 07:21.200]  Which is an interesting way of charging more that they just took away the 128 gigabyte
[07:21.200 --> 07:22.760]  Pro Max.
[07:22.760 --> 07:26.000]  But basically, I talked to a couple of people last week at the event and they were like,
[07:26.000 --> 07:32.520]  if they use three nanometer, if they had like A17 and A17 Pro this year chips on A17 without,
[07:32.520 --> 07:37.080]  maybe without the USB-C3 controller or whatever else, I would assume, I think there's a lot
[07:37.080 --> 07:41.960]  of silicon in the A17 Pro for the Pro photography features, right?
[07:41.960 --> 07:44.520]  With the ProRes and stuff like that.
[07:44.520 --> 07:45.520]  Take that off.
[07:45.520 --> 07:50.400]  But there's no way they could get all of the three nanometer wafers that they would need
[07:50.400 --> 07:53.240]  if all of the A15s were on it.
[07:53.240 --> 07:55.080]  It's just a statement of fact.
[07:55.080 --> 07:57.000]  There's just not enough wafers in the world.
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.080]  So I think that's interesting.
[07:59.080 --> 08:05.000]  I thought the other thing with the event is as we settle into this new era of new style
[08:05.000 --> 08:10.320]  events where they're not performed on stage, I thought, I didn't think of this last year,
[08:10.320 --> 08:12.820]  but I thought this year I was like, you know what this is like?
[08:12.820 --> 08:18.620]  It is like we're attending a movie premiere and we're just in the media and it's a big
[08:18.620 --> 08:19.620]  movie, right?
[08:19.620 --> 08:23.240]  This isn't like we're at Sundance and we're watching some indie production.
[08:23.240 --> 08:27.960]  This is James Cameron, the avatar blockbuster that's expected to.
[08:27.960 --> 08:28.960]  Right.
[08:28.960 --> 08:29.960]  Right.
[08:29.960 --> 08:30.960]  Yeah.
[08:30.960 --> 08:31.960]  It's like reviewing Star Wars.
[08:31.960 --> 08:35.800]  I've done the Star Wars movie reviews before you go to the premiere and then you ostensibly
[08:35.800 --> 08:37.240]  write a review.
[08:37.240 --> 08:38.280]  Those are their own beast.
[08:38.280 --> 08:41.360]  It's not like reviewing a Sundance indie.
[08:41.360 --> 08:46.360]  This is like high grade explosive, big time production thing.
[08:46.360 --> 08:47.360]  Yep.
[08:47.360 --> 08:48.760]  This is what I tried to get this into my review.
[08:48.760 --> 08:50.680]  I hope I did, but I do.
[08:50.680 --> 08:51.680]  It's just palpable.
[08:51.680 --> 08:53.040]  And I think it's right.
[08:53.040 --> 08:58.520]  I think if I worked at Apple and got to put my two cents into this, is this the right
[08:58.520 --> 09:02.600]  way for Apple as a company to prioritize its products?
[09:02.600 --> 09:08.200]  I would say yes, even though my most beloved product is the Mac, I think it's right.
[09:08.200 --> 09:15.080]  It is so obvious that the iPhone is the number one product at Apple and that they do not
[09:15.080 --> 09:20.080]  take for granted that it is the success that it is in any way.
[09:20.080 --> 09:21.160]  They are the opposite.
[09:21.160 --> 09:26.800]  They, there's the fable of the golden goose and I guess in the fable, they take advantage
[09:26.800 --> 09:30.480]  of it and the goose dies, I guess in most tellings of the story.
[09:30.480 --> 09:35.880]  Apple is like, has like a full time veterinarian staff around this goose.
[09:35.880 --> 09:43.640]  Yeah, yeah, this goose is being foie gras to an inch of its life.
[09:43.640 --> 09:44.640]  Right.
[09:44.640 --> 09:50.640]  It's got like an Apple watch around its neck so that they could monitor all of its vitals,
[09:50.640 --> 09:52.840]  but they, they aren't taking advantage.
[09:52.840 --> 09:58.480]  They aren't taking for granted one iota of the iPhone's success in the world and they
[09:58.480 --> 10:06.120]  are just peddled to the metal on pushing it forward as fast as they can year over year.
[10:06.120 --> 10:12.320]  Well, it is their highest publicity event is there by far and away.
[10:12.320 --> 10:17.220]  I just think that so many people in our universe, the nerd universe just, it just doesn't register
[10:17.220 --> 10:22.480]  with them how much awareness there is in the real world of people that, Hey, new iPhones
[10:22.480 --> 10:25.640]  are coming out and they only know like three things.
[10:25.640 --> 10:29.360]  Very high level things like, Oh, a bigger zoom and it's made of titanium or something
[10:29.360 --> 10:32.400]  now, which is like in a meteor because that's what I saw in the commercial.
[10:32.400 --> 10:36.800]  That awareness alone, just that is amazing for a cell phone.
[10:36.800 --> 10:37.800]  Yeah.
[10:37.800 --> 10:38.800]  Yeah, exactly.
[10:38.800 --> 10:43.540]  I mean, I think the, the brand awareness compare between that and like whatever the latest
[10:43.540 --> 10:50.000]  pixel is a pixel seven or whatever would be, it would be an insurmountable gap of customer
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.180]  awareness, right?
[10:52.180 --> 10:57.400]  Pretty much everybody with access to any sort of internet or TV is going to know period
[10:57.400 --> 11:03.000]  that the iPhone is coming out and probably at least one, if not a couple of their high
[11:03.000 --> 11:04.480]  level selling points.
[11:04.480 --> 11:08.080]  And that's, that's like the efficacy is on the level of the super bowl.
[11:08.080 --> 11:12.800]  And in fact, as you've mentioned before, they actually get more viewers to the super bowl
[11:12.800 --> 11:17.200]  over in the aggregate because it's a global event and the super bowl is by and large a
[11:17.200 --> 11:18.760]  U S based event.
[11:18.760 --> 11:21.540]  And Apple does refer to it as their super bowl internally.
[11:21.540 --> 11:24.900]  You and I both heard executives refer to it that way.
[11:24.900 --> 11:30.460]  So they're very cognizant of that fact that this is their, their Mount Olympus of events
[11:30.460 --> 11:32.720]  and certainly it focused on the iPhone.
[11:32.720 --> 11:36.440]  I think in that way, when you look at it, the character of the event in that way, it
[11:36.440 --> 11:40.720]  makes a lot of sense exactly why they do it and the reasons they do it.
[11:40.720 --> 11:45.740]  And I, I have waffled back and forth on the alignment issue, right?
[11:45.740 --> 11:49.880]  Because I think that every time these events happen and you get complaints about like,
[11:49.880 --> 11:55.780]  Oh, no big new thing or whatever's an innovation that isn't dead and Oh, this is just an iPhone
[11:55.780 --> 11:58.200]  again and looks the same as last year.
[11:58.200 --> 12:03.320]  All of those little things are echoes really of an underlying thing, which is that the
[12:03.320 --> 12:10.200]  way Apple talks about the iPhone is very much geared towards the world with a capital W
[12:10.200 --> 12:12.300]  and it is a marketing event, right?
[12:12.300 --> 12:13.300]  At its core.
[12:13.300 --> 12:14.640]  It's a marketing event for Apple.
[12:14.640 --> 12:18.180]  This is not an introduction of technology.
[12:18.180 --> 12:21.020]  Apple has positioned it that way in the past.
[12:21.020 --> 12:22.280]  That's where they anchored it.
[12:22.280 --> 12:27.600]  Hey, we're here to tell you about all the wonderful new technology that we have invented
[12:27.600 --> 12:31.040]  or created for you in the past year or two years.
[12:31.040 --> 12:33.860]  It's still in very much is that way underneath.
[12:33.860 --> 12:35.820]  If you dig in, there's plenty of meat here.
[12:35.820 --> 12:39.160]  I mean the, the zoom lenses and the processor, et cetera, et cetera.
[12:39.160 --> 12:41.400]  There's a lot of work here, right?
[12:41.400 --> 12:47.040]  However, for the general public, I think the messaging is very much just, look, there's
[12:47.040 --> 12:48.040]  new iPhones.
[12:48.040 --> 12:53.080]  You should buy a new iPhone and the press and media that cover it or, and I extend this
[12:53.080 --> 12:59.160]  out to the long tail of enthusiasts across social media platforms and YouTube, et cetera,
[12:59.160 --> 13:04.280]  who pay attention to this stuff closely and are sort of expecting it to deliver them content
[13:04.280 --> 13:07.320]  that they can create or use to create and talk about.
[13:07.320 --> 13:12.640]  I think that when you focus on that, there is a misalignment between those two worlds
[13:12.640 --> 13:18.760]  that causes this sort of like, Oh yeah, but like it doesn't hover, right?
[13:18.760 --> 13:23.760]  It doesn't, it doesn't fire lasers from the camera to like disintegrate my enemies.
[13:23.760 --> 13:28.040]  Like where is the big new thing that I can kind of focus on and write about and talk
[13:28.040 --> 13:30.080]  about it debate or whatever.
[13:30.080 --> 13:33.440]  I don't think that alignment is ever going to go away as especially as long as Apple
[13:33.440 --> 13:36.920]  keeps up this super bowl-esque atmosphere to their events.
[13:36.920 --> 13:43.520]  I thought one of the most telling aspects of just how mainstream the interest is in
[13:43.520 --> 13:49.360]  this was my wife is a, is a big Howard Stern fan and she was listening to the Howard Stern
[13:49.360 --> 13:50.360]  show.
[13:50.360 --> 13:54.080]  I don't know, sometime later in the week it was after I got home.
[13:54.080 --> 13:57.720]  I don't know what day the, she often doesn't listen same day, but they were talking about
[13:57.720 --> 14:02.000]  the fact that they all watched the event and they were making fun of it.
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.040]  Like how stupid is this?
[14:04.040 --> 14:06.720]  That there's a two hour event just for a new cell phone.
[14:06.720 --> 14:08.820]  This is the dumbest thing in the world.
[14:08.820 --> 14:13.560]  And they were acknowledging, but we all watched it and they're like, yeah, how stupid are
[14:13.560 --> 14:14.560]  we?
[14:14.560 --> 14:15.560]  And it was so funny.
[14:15.560 --> 14:18.620]  They were, and they were talking about the segment with Kayan Drance and that's why Amy
[14:18.620 --> 14:19.960]  called me and she's like, Oh my God.
[14:19.960 --> 14:20.960]  Cause we know her.
[14:20.960 --> 14:26.440]  I, I, I, I know her husband Matt and it's just weird when somebody, you know, somewhat
[14:26.440 --> 14:30.560]  socially is being talked about on the Howard Stern show, but they didn't, they didn't remember
[14:30.560 --> 14:31.560]  her name.
[14:31.560 --> 14:36.640]  They called her Apple lady and they're like, I'm sure Kayan got a kick out of that.
[14:36.640 --> 14:37.640]  Yeah.
[14:37.640 --> 14:40.480]  But they're like, I think it was a Howard who was like, Apple lady's telling me about
[14:40.480 --> 14:41.840]  how many nits the phone has.
[14:41.840 --> 14:42.840]  So what's a nit?
[14:42.840 --> 14:44.120]  Who the hell knows what a nit is?
[14:44.120 --> 14:45.160]  What am I supposed to do?
[14:45.160 --> 14:50.880]  All I know is that phone looks cool, but that's, yeah, and that's the alignment issue, right?
[14:50.880 --> 14:53.820]  Like a nerd is going to care about the nits.
[14:53.820 --> 14:56.480]  Somebody and by nerd, I'm being very generous with that term.
[14:56.480 --> 15:00.540]  Like people who care about advancements in technology or will this demonstrably improve
[15:00.540 --> 15:03.380]  by workflow or, or will it be better for me?
[15:03.380 --> 15:06.600]  Like people that care about this stuff, like they're like, tell me the nits, right?
[15:06.600 --> 15:07.600]  Yeah.
[15:07.600 --> 15:09.160]  And everybody else is like, what the hell is a nit?
[15:09.160 --> 15:10.160]  Yeah.
[15:10.160 --> 15:11.320]  But we've, we have, you're right though.
[15:11.320 --> 15:13.160]  I think you've put your finger on it though.
[15:13.160 --> 15:16.920]  And as much as there are, so there are complaints from people like the Howard Stern show that
[15:16.920 --> 15:19.000]  there's too much technical jargon, right?
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.500]  On the other hand, we are, we are very far removed.
[15:22.500 --> 15:27.440]  It's not just the difference between a live stage presentation and a totally prerecorded
[15:27.440 --> 15:32.240]  thing, but we are quite a way removed from some of those photography segments that Phil
[15:32.240 --> 15:39.720]  Schiller always emceed, where they would go deep into the weeds on focus pixels, right?
[15:39.720 --> 15:45.120]  And they would like commission these fancy 3D vector drawings, like of tilting the sensor
[15:45.120 --> 15:51.880]  in three dimensions so that you can see how the light rays hit these focus pixels.
[15:51.880 --> 15:59.240]  Like Schiller as an optics professor giving like optics 101 presentation on digital sensor,
[15:59.240 --> 16:00.240]  you know?
[16:00.240 --> 16:03.000]  And I've always loved that stuff because the camera is so interesting to me.
[16:03.000 --> 16:05.880]  And I know that Schiller loves that stuff too.
[16:05.880 --> 16:10.560]  And his enthusiasm was palpable in those segments, but there's, it's just no way today.
[16:10.560 --> 16:14.520]  They're going to have jaws up there for 10 minutes talking about focus pixels.
[16:14.520 --> 16:15.520]  Yeah.
[16:15.520 --> 16:21.760]  I mean, I think it's great in a way because it's sort of like the people that, that cared
[16:21.760 --> 16:25.140]  and nerded out about this stuff, got away with talking about it way longer than they
[16:25.140 --> 16:26.920]  should have over the years, right?
[16:26.920 --> 16:29.320]  Like Schiller would have still been talking about it, right?
[16:29.320 --> 16:32.840]  Like if they let him, they still have a whole segment on it because I know I talked to him
[16:32.840 --> 16:36.240]  at the event and he was like super stoked with the cameras and all of that stuff.
[16:36.240 --> 16:38.340]  He would still be up there talking about it.
[16:38.340 --> 16:39.680]  And I think that's good.
[16:39.680 --> 16:43.200]  It shows that there are people inside that like really care about these details and all
[16:43.200 --> 16:44.200]  of that stuff.
[16:44.200 --> 16:48.720]  But yeah, once again, the alignment, they're definitely have to twisted the dial away and
[16:48.720 --> 16:52.160]  towards the broader and, and yet they're still in an awkward spot, right?
[16:52.160 --> 16:56.120]  They're still in an uncanny valley between the people that care about the underlying
[16:56.120 --> 16:58.560]  technologies and the people that care about the application.
[16:58.560 --> 16:59.560]  So yeah.
[16:59.560 --> 17:01.880]  All right, let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor.

[18:26.240 --> 18:27.240]  It's just a terrific place.
[18:27.240 --> 18:29.340]  It is the first place I recommend people go.
[18:29.340 --> 18:33.520]  It's the first place you should recommend the people in need of a new website in your
[18:33.520 --> 18:34.600]  life go.
[18:34.600 --> 18:41.640]  And that URL again, squarespace.com slash talk show, and that gets you 10% off your
[18:41.640 --> 18:43.280]  first purchase.
[18:43.280 --> 18:47.680]  My thanks to Squarespace.
[18:47.680 --> 18:48.940]  I guess we should move on though.
[18:48.940 --> 18:49.940]  It's good to be back.
[18:49.940 --> 18:51.720]  It does feel normal again.
[18:51.720 --> 18:58.780]  It is super useful to talk to people off the record again in a way that just you can say
[18:58.780 --> 19:03.340]  off the record on a WebEx call or a phone call.
[19:03.340 --> 19:04.560]  It's not the same, right?
[19:04.560 --> 19:08.880]  There's like an inherent trust and then not like I got or you got or, you know, we were
[19:08.880 --> 19:10.160]  together for some of the stuff.
[19:10.160 --> 19:14.280]  It's not like we got any kind of deep dark secrets that, oh boy, what we heard off the
[19:14.280 --> 19:15.280]  record.
[19:15.280 --> 19:18.960]  But off the record, we hate these phones and we think they're terrible.
[19:18.960 --> 19:19.960]  Yeah.
[19:19.960 --> 19:27.520]  I mean, titanium gives me a rash or nothing like that, but it's just good to be back.
[19:27.520 --> 19:34.040]  Boy, though, it is like after the event that hands on area, my God, it is such a scrum.
[19:34.040 --> 19:35.040]  It is.
[19:35.040 --> 19:36.040]  It's just unfathomable.
[19:36.040 --> 19:38.560]  I took a video that I posted on threads.
[19:38.560 --> 19:46.940]  People seem to like showing like the I wouldn't call it pandemonium, but it is it is very
[19:46.940 --> 19:52.640]  difficult to get hands on more difficult than ever before to get hands on with the with
[19:52.640 --> 19:58.040]  the products after the event in the hands on area, just because everybody wants it.
[19:58.040 --> 19:59.480]  Everybody's on deadline.
[19:59.480 --> 20:02.360]  All the people shooting video want space.
[20:02.360 --> 20:08.140]  The video people want space between the camera and the product to get the good shots.
[20:08.140 --> 20:10.500]  And that's there's no space to be had.
[20:10.500 --> 20:15.900]  So for me, who's not on deadline and not shooting video, I enjoy watching it just as like it's
[20:15.900 --> 20:18.080]  like another spectacle after the show itself.
[20:18.080 --> 20:20.120]  Yeah, no, it is.
[20:20.120 --> 20:21.120]  It's interesting.
[20:21.120 --> 20:22.120]  I do.
[20:22.120 --> 20:23.120]  I mill around a little bit.
[20:23.120 --> 20:24.120]  If I can edge in anywhere, I will.
[20:24.120 --> 20:27.860]  But I don't force myself or wait in any of the lines because they kind of like, set them
[20:27.860 --> 20:29.700]  up in little stations.
[20:29.700 --> 20:33.400]  And then lines form behind those stations where they have people kind of demonstrating
[20:33.400 --> 20:36.060]  the phones for you or watches or whatever.
[20:36.060 --> 20:41.800]  And I just kind of like walk around and kind of observe the crowd and the patterns and
[20:41.800 --> 20:43.920]  like listen to what other people are saying.
[20:43.920 --> 20:46.340]  And then kind of observe, as you said, the spectacle of it.
[20:46.340 --> 20:50.840]  Like Tim will come out and a bunch of people will mill just you'll see this mass of people
[20:50.840 --> 20:52.720]  just descend on Tim.
[20:52.720 --> 20:56.680]  And of course, they'll have some sort of like relatively lightly orchestrated Tim meets
[20:56.680 --> 20:59.340]  a really important guest, a VIP guest.
[20:59.340 --> 21:01.160]  And they sort of like talk about the phones.
[21:01.160 --> 21:03.040]  Like Tim's never seen them before.
[21:03.040 --> 21:05.320]  Like, look, this thing.
[21:05.320 --> 21:06.320]  Oh, wow.
[21:06.320 --> 21:07.320]  We made this.
[21:07.320 --> 21:08.320]  This is amazing.
[21:08.320 --> 21:09.320]  I love all of that.
[21:09.320 --> 21:10.320]  That's fun.
[21:10.320 --> 21:12.760]  But yeah, and then honestly, what I do is I talk to other media people who are in the
[21:12.760 --> 21:16.640]  same boat as you or I, where like maybe a part of their team is on deadline getting
[21:16.640 --> 21:21.480]  the video and audio and whatever they need to get their quick hits out.
[21:21.480 --> 21:26.200]  But then we are sort of standing back, like I'll often see Eli there or you or Joanna
[21:26.200 --> 21:29.240]  and we'll talk a little bit about kind of what we thought.
[21:29.240 --> 21:32.160]  And then Apple folks and just a lot of the senior people are there.
[21:32.160 --> 21:34.400]  And so mill around and say hi.
[21:34.400 --> 21:39.600]  And like, that's the reason I still was happy to go to these things and not say like, hey,
[21:39.600 --> 21:43.640]  ship me a video besides the briefing part of it, which is like, hey, you get to go and
[21:43.640 --> 21:47.760]  ask some focus questions of senior people about these devices.
[21:47.760 --> 21:53.500]  The bigger part of it for me was like, there's always serendipity in those rooms, which do
[21:53.500 --> 21:55.680]  still make it a hot ticket.
[21:55.680 --> 21:59.640]  It's certainly their size of these events has expanded the amount of people they invite
[21:59.640 --> 22:04.280]  to them and the breadth of folks that they invite to them, which is great.
[22:04.280 --> 22:09.560]  They invite YouTubers and social media personalities and fashion people, because they have so
[22:09.560 --> 22:12.920]  many different audiences to address and all of that's great.
[22:12.920 --> 22:15.300]  I think it's I have no problem with any of it.
[22:15.300 --> 22:18.740]  It's definitely a lot different, obviously, than you or I were attending events 10 years
[22:18.740 --> 22:23.100]  ago or plus when you knew all the all the players because it was all the nerds covering
[22:23.100 --> 22:24.880]  chips and hardware and all that.
[22:24.880 --> 22:26.940]  But you talk to them and you just kind of get the vibe.
[22:26.940 --> 22:28.600]  That's why I think it's still worth it to go to those things.
[22:28.600 --> 22:29.600]  It's fun.
[22:29.600 --> 22:30.600]  Yeah.
[22:30.600 --> 22:35.020]  It's always interesting to see what Apple after the event wants to prioritize in terms
[22:35.020 --> 22:38.160]  of what what subjects they give briefings on.
[22:38.160 --> 22:39.160]  Right.
[22:39.160 --> 22:41.760]  And of course, they'll do briefings on the silicon.
[22:41.760 --> 22:42.760]  Right.
[22:42.760 --> 22:48.280]  And I did not get an off the record briefing on the A17 Pro Silicon this year.
[22:48.280 --> 22:51.640]  It was way more camera specific this year.
[22:51.640 --> 22:52.640]  Yeah.
[22:52.640 --> 22:55.920]  Well, to be specific for those people who don't get briefings, which is, I think, almost
[22:55.920 --> 23:00.040]  everybody, a lot of people, the way that they normally would do it is when you talk about
[23:00.040 --> 23:01.600]  a focus briefing.
[23:01.600 --> 23:06.160]  This is not that they won't talk about it to us or answer questions about the A17, which
[23:06.160 --> 23:07.160]  they do.
[23:07.160 --> 23:10.120]  Obviously, they'll have a briefing about the phone, right?
[23:10.120 --> 23:11.500]  Or the whole lineup.
[23:11.500 --> 23:13.480]  And you can ask any questions you want.
[23:13.480 --> 23:14.720]  They'll give you whatever answers.
[23:14.720 --> 23:17.960]  And they definitely often phone a friend like they're well briefed.
[23:17.960 --> 23:21.640]  I mean, these people are generally not comms reps.
[23:21.640 --> 23:25.160]  They will be in the room with like with the Marcom people.
[23:25.160 --> 23:29.640]  But these are generally like engineers that worked in the product or PMs who led iPhone
[23:29.640 --> 23:31.280]  this year or whatever.
[23:31.280 --> 23:35.720]  And like those those folks are incredibly well informed and well prepared.
[23:35.720 --> 23:39.120]  However, now and then you and I obviously make a game of it.
[23:39.120 --> 23:43.360]  Sometimes we'll ask questions where they don't know the answer and they will jot it down.
[23:43.360 --> 23:47.080]  The Marcom person in the room will jot it down and be like, we'll get back to you with
[23:47.080 --> 23:48.080]  that.
[23:48.080 --> 23:51.520]  And oftentimes they have the answer before the briefing is over because they'll be texting
[23:51.520 --> 23:56.360]  engineers or people on the teams or they'll have it very soon thereafter.
[23:56.360 --> 23:57.660]  And that part of it's fun.
[23:57.660 --> 24:03.760]  But the focus briefing around like this is we're only here to talk about the A17 Pro
[24:03.760 --> 24:04.760]  today.
[24:04.760 --> 24:07.600]  Like if you want to talk about the camera or the charging port or anything else, talk
[24:07.600 --> 24:08.600]  to somebody else.
[24:08.600 --> 24:09.720]  We're just here to talk about the chip.
[24:09.720 --> 24:13.840]  They didn't do one of those this year, which was interesting because I kind of assumed
[24:13.840 --> 24:18.220]  that they would given how much focus there was in the GPU and all of that and how impressive
[24:18.220 --> 24:21.560]  it looks to be, by the way, judging from early, early reviews.
[24:21.560 --> 24:22.560]  So yeah, definitely.
[24:22.560 --> 24:28.480]  You know, and it was very GPU optimized, you know, and my my read between the lines on
[24:28.480 --> 24:38.200]  that is that that's really going to come into play when this A17 Pro generation of silicon
[24:38.200 --> 24:45.980]  turns into the M3 series and because it's it's the GPU where the M1 and M2 at the high
[24:45.980 --> 24:51.880]  end, at the professional end, are still behind the state of the art in performance, perhaps
[24:51.880 --> 24:54.880]  a probably not, I think, performance per watt.
[24:54.880 --> 25:00.760]  But they're so far behind in sheer performance compared to the high end of high end of Nvidia
[25:00.760 --> 25:08.740]  and even even AMD video cards, which again, that saying even AMD really shows how they're
[25:08.740 --> 25:10.360]  behind in this area.
[25:10.360 --> 25:12.920]  And it's a good place for Apple to be right.
[25:12.920 --> 25:17.100]  Like the two in my review, I mentioned that the two areas where Apple is behind the state
[25:17.100 --> 25:20.840]  of the art is they're behind on GPU sheer performance.
[25:20.840 --> 25:27.360]  And they made a very, very conspicuous emphasis on that aspect of the A17 Pro.
[25:27.360 --> 25:33.800]  And they are and might be for a very long time to come, still behind on photography,
[25:33.800 --> 25:40.300]  not compared to other phones, but when you compare them to just $2,000 cameras, period,
[25:40.300 --> 25:41.300]  you know,
[25:41.300 --> 25:45.560]  which is like insane, right, that that's their benchmark now, right?
[25:45.560 --> 25:50.720]  It's no longer like, oh, we made an incremental improvement over like last year's Pixel phone
[25:50.720 --> 25:51.720]  or whatever.
[25:51.720 --> 25:52.720]  And I think that's, that's great.
[25:52.720 --> 25:54.360]  It's a great place for them to be.
[25:54.360 --> 25:59.080]  It's a very I know, for sure, you and I have talked to Phil over the years, and I know
[25:59.080 --> 26:00.720]  for sure, that's where he wanted to be.
[26:00.720 --> 26:05.600]  Yeah, he's like, because they were very proud when they became the world's most used camera,
[26:05.600 --> 26:06.600]  period.
[26:06.600 --> 26:07.600]  Right.
[26:07.600 --> 26:09.680]  You know, which they've been for a while or where the iPhone has been for a while, I should
[26:09.680 --> 26:10.680]  say.
[26:10.680 --> 26:14.600]  But they, I do not think they'll be satisfied until they're like, essentially the best camera
[26:14.600 --> 26:17.920]  you can buy for any consumer level of money, right?
[26:17.920 --> 26:22.840]  I don't know, I don't know about the pro level, but like, as a consumer, you couldn't buy
[26:22.840 --> 26:23.840]  a better camera.
[26:23.840 --> 26:25.640]  And I think that's where they want to be eventually.
[26:25.640 --> 26:27.320]  I will put a link in the show notes.
[26:27.320 --> 26:31.440]  I just looked it up the other day because it came up on I think this is the problem.
[26:31.440 --> 26:38.760]  I don't remember now if it's Mastodon or threads, or when I Yeah, yeah, all your different silos.
[26:38.760 --> 26:47.740]  I dip I have one one foot toes dipped in Mastodon another in threads and I've got a third foot
[26:47.740 --> 26:50.000]  dipped in still still checking in on Twitter.
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.380]  Yeah, you gotta be trilingual to get anything done.
[26:53.380 --> 26:54.480]  But somebody brought it up.
[26:54.480 --> 26:59.240]  And the first time I had Schiller on stage at my talk show when it was a complete surprise
[26:59.240 --> 27:03.880]  to the audience, it's my it's still like my favorite segment of all of those on stage
[27:03.880 --> 27:08.520]  interviews I've done was I asked him about and this is like 2014.
[27:08.520 --> 27:12.120]  I think maybe 25th 2014 or 2015, maybe 2014.
[27:12.120 --> 27:14.320]  But at a decade ago, effectively, right?
[27:14.320 --> 27:19.200]  I know photography is important with the iPhone, but do you consider Apple to be one of the
[27:19.200 --> 27:22.180]  leading camera companies period in the world?
[27:22.180 --> 27:26.320]  And his answer was the and I just love that.
[27:26.320 --> 27:28.240]  I just love that instantly.
[27:28.240 --> 27:32.400]  And it was a jovial interview, but he got like dead serious when he said it like that
[27:32.400 --> 27:40.000]  it a decade ago, Phil Schiller, his goal, his vision of Apple was the singular leading
[27:40.000 --> 27:41.960]  camera company in the world.
[27:41.960 --> 27:46.200]  And I remember when it came out and people were like, this is a joke because it was like
[27:46.200 --> 27:49.640]  the iPhone five s or something like that, which was a good cell phone camera.
[27:49.640 --> 27:54.760]  But it just was it's just been a remarkable decade for iPhone photography.
[27:54.760 --> 27:58.620]  And yeah, well, he saw like he saw the next two generations, right?
[27:58.620 --> 28:01.400]  They were probably already working on telephoto at that point and all that.
[28:01.400 --> 28:02.920]  And he saw where it was headed.
[28:02.920 --> 28:03.920]  Yeah.
[28:03.920 --> 28:07.840]  Also, I think at that point, he could make the statement in the present, as this is the
[28:07.840 --> 28:09.800]  camera people use the most, right?
[28:09.800 --> 28:11.400]  That's why we're the leading camera company.
[28:11.400 --> 28:13.320]  But you could tell.
[28:13.320 --> 28:18.040]  We know we don't know that he what he really meant by it was that we will eventually be
[28:18.040 --> 28:22.820]  like the best right camera you could possibly have as a casual camera and eventually maybe
[28:22.820 --> 28:23.820]  even higher.
[28:23.820 --> 28:24.820]  Right.
[28:24.820 --> 28:29.700]  The thing that I don't think was as clear outside Apple or the other leading edge technology
[28:29.700 --> 28:32.840]  companies on the computational photography front a decade ago.
[28:32.840 --> 28:36.820]  The thing that was obvious to everybody is that there's no way cell phones are ever going
[28:36.820 --> 28:38.800]  to catch up optically.
[28:38.800 --> 28:40.060]  There's just no way.
[28:40.060 --> 28:43.220]  We know how light capture work physics works a certain way, right?
[28:43.220 --> 28:45.380]  And sensor size matters.
[28:45.380 --> 28:50.560]  And in the real standalone camera world, people have these serious photographers have these
[28:50.560 --> 28:55.560]  serious debates about the difference between 35 millimeter full quote unquote, full size
[28:55.560 --> 29:03.060]  sensors and the four third sensor, which the four third sensor is smaller than a 35 millimeter.
[29:03.060 --> 29:06.880]  But it is, I don't know, it's like 20 times bigger than a camera sensor.
[29:06.880 --> 29:09.280]  I mean, so much bigger.
[29:09.280 --> 29:12.140]  And the lens size alone.
[29:12.140 --> 29:17.840]  I mean, you don't have to even know jack squat about photography, except to know that if
[29:17.840 --> 29:24.600]  you go and look at a camera camera, even if it's a consumer type model, the lens is this
[29:24.600 --> 29:27.120]  big ping pong ball size of glass.
[29:27.120 --> 29:32.000]  And that's I'm talking consumer, you know, and then everybody knows professional photographers,
[29:32.000 --> 29:37.340]  you know, like, let's talk the five x like 120 millimeter lens that you would put on
[29:37.340 --> 29:43.440]  an interchangeable camera system is a big, big piece of glass, it's a big piece of glass
[29:43.440 --> 29:46.520]  on the front, and it sticks out from the camera.
[29:46.520 --> 29:53.360]  And it impossible amount, you'd have to stack 20 iPhones on top of each other to get that
[29:53.360 --> 29:55.340]  sort of right.
[29:55.340 --> 29:57.100]  So how in the world is that ever going to happen?
[29:57.100 --> 30:01.480]  And what Schiller knew a decade ago that we couldn't know is where computational photography
[30:01.480 --> 30:07.240]  was going, and what sort of things they were already working towards to route around that.
[30:07.240 --> 30:12.600]  And we see the reason like, and it's so funny, because like the the doing of it is hard.
[30:12.600 --> 30:19.000]  But when you actually just lay out the rough kind of idea, it seems very straightforward,
[30:19.000 --> 30:24.000]  actually, it's like, Oh, hey, we're gonna make up for the inability to gather light
[30:24.000 --> 30:28.260]  to gather more light that we would be able to from a bigger lens, we're going to use
[30:28.260 --> 30:31.280]  the processor to do more of this work.
[30:31.280 --> 30:34.080]  And people are like, Oh, why, you know, why do you think that'll make a difference?
[30:34.080 --> 30:38.400]  And you're like, well, because traditionally, camera processors have been these very low
[30:38.400 --> 30:43.800]  powered things that just sort of are there to package the image, do some color correction
[30:43.800 --> 30:51.600]  and package the image, because those things, those ICS have been part of camera pipeline
[30:51.600 --> 30:56.160]  since the first digital cameras, right, like Canon, Nikon come out with their cameras,
[30:56.160 --> 31:01.340]  and they we need something because the raw image back then it was CCD.
[31:01.340 --> 31:06.620]  For the most part, the raw image from CCDs was so noisy and funky, a let's do some noise
[31:06.620 --> 31:10.840]  correction and let's package this as a JPEG and we need a chip in there to get it done.
[31:10.840 --> 31:11.840]  Right.
[31:11.840 --> 31:19.760]  But nobody had ever sort of like brought the main line CPU game into this thing until phones
[31:19.760 --> 31:21.960]  started taking pictures, right?
[31:21.960 --> 31:25.320]  Because like, hey, these things have a CPU, a true CPU in them.
[31:25.320 --> 31:28.480]  And we're going to put them into the image path and see what they could do.
[31:28.480 --> 31:34.080]  Now of course, there are dedicated components of the SOC that are still dedicated to camera
[31:34.080 --> 31:35.080]  work.
[31:35.080 --> 31:39.660]  But the overhead of a lot of computational photography is handled by just a raw power
[31:39.660 --> 31:42.480]  of silicon that Apple has kind of brought to bear.
[31:42.480 --> 31:47.600]  And so the what people didn't know aspect of it was not just that the CPU was going
[31:47.600 --> 31:52.680]  to come into play, but that their power per watt of the CPU was going to get so good that
[31:52.680 --> 32:00.400]  you could do enormously complex real-time processing on photos without just demolishing
[32:00.400 --> 32:01.400]  your battery.
[32:01.400 --> 32:02.400]  Right?
[32:02.400 --> 32:03.800]  Taking five pictures and your camera's dead.
[32:03.800 --> 32:04.800]  Right.
[32:04.800 --> 32:05.800]  Right.
[32:05.800 --> 32:09.280]  And the other thing that ties in addition to the CPU is the neural engine, right?
[32:09.280 --> 32:14.040]  And the machine learning, which manifests itself in a very big way this year with the
[32:14.040 --> 32:23.560]  auto detection of human faces, dog faces, and cat faces, and just instantaneous, seamless,
[32:23.560 --> 32:29.680]  you know, I want to explain this to my readers and listeners here.
[32:29.680 --> 32:35.280]  And yet still using the phone, it's so automatic.
[32:35.280 --> 32:40.560]  It's like, oh, I forgot, it doesn't matter what you do, you just move the viewfinder
[32:40.560 --> 32:44.360]  around and it just keeps track of all these human faces.
[32:44.360 --> 32:50.920]  And there were questions from other media people, people, I forget who, it was an interesting
[32:50.920 --> 32:51.920]  thing.
[32:51.920 --> 32:53.160]  Somebody was asking, well, what about rabbits?
[32:53.160 --> 32:55.920]  And they're like, well, we didn't train it on machine learning of rabbits, but they're
[32:55.920 --> 32:57.440]  like, isn't a rabbit close?
[32:57.440 --> 32:59.200]  Is it maybe close enough to a cat?
[32:59.200 --> 33:04.640]  And they're like, they couldn't get the Apple person to say, they wanted them to say, well,
[33:04.640 --> 33:11.560]  if it's a cat, if it's a rabbit that particularly looks cat-like maybe, no, the Apple wasn't
[33:11.560 --> 33:12.560]  going to say it.
[33:12.560 --> 33:15.960]  They were just going to say, we've trained it on dogs, cats, and humans, but that who
[33:15.960 --> 33:20.840]  knows where else that machine learning pipeline comes in, but you don't notice because you're
[33:20.840 --> 33:22.060]  not touching buttons.
[33:22.060 --> 33:23.840]  You're not saying do it.
[33:23.840 --> 33:27.780]  And it spins for a second and processes what's in the viewfinder.
[33:27.780 --> 33:33.960]  It's just, as you wave the viewfinder around the world surrounding you, it's just using
[33:33.960 --> 33:36.580]  machine learning to pick up these things.
[33:36.580 --> 33:43.720]  And that's a very difficult thing for the traditional camera companies to compete with.
[33:43.720 --> 33:48.160]  Because it's not like they can just say, okay, we're going to buy the strongest, the most
[33:48.160 --> 33:54.480]  powerful processor from, you know, Snapdragon line up and shove it in a Canon camera, right?
[33:54.480 --> 33:57.720]  And I'm not saying, obviously the camera companies have come a long way and they're doing good
[33:57.720 --> 34:01.720]  work, but having expertise from a completely different profession that you bring to the
[34:01.720 --> 34:06.680]  table, a completely different profession and melding those two together.
[34:06.680 --> 34:08.000]  And that's what's happening here, right?
[34:08.000 --> 34:13.620]  Like the world of machine learning and processor design and all of that melded with the world
[34:13.620 --> 34:15.720]  of optical design and cameras.
[34:15.720 --> 34:20.160]  And it sort of goes back to the old adage, like who can get better at what faster, right?
[34:20.160 --> 34:21.400]  And while we have our answer.
[34:21.400 --> 34:26.280]  Yeah, I bought, I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about it, but last winter,
[34:26.280 --> 34:33.120]  I think it was in January or so I bought a Rico GR three acts, which 15 years ago I had
[34:33.120 --> 34:35.760]  the original Rico GR three.
[34:35.760 --> 34:41.280]  This is a very small pocket size camera camera.
[34:41.280 --> 34:42.360]  I love my old Rico.
[34:42.360 --> 34:45.400]  I love my new Rico three acts.
[34:45.400 --> 34:46.680]  It's small black.
[34:46.680 --> 34:51.040]  It has a fixed prime lens that is a 40 millimeter equivalent.
[34:51.040 --> 34:53.120]  So it's not really very wide.
[34:53.120 --> 34:56.080]  It's close to normal and I really like it.
[34:56.080 --> 34:57.960]  And I love the images I get from it.
[34:57.960 --> 35:02.520]  I'm very glad I bought it, but man, it is so dumb.
[35:02.520 --> 35:04.640]  I don't know how else to say it.
[35:04.640 --> 35:09.080]  And Rico's software is generally well regarded by other reviewers.
[35:09.080 --> 35:10.200]  I like it.
[35:10.200 --> 35:14.920]  I think compared to other cameras and when I think back to like using other camera cameras
[35:14.920 --> 35:19.960]  I've had over the years, like the auto focus is good and things are smart, but compared
[35:19.960 --> 35:26.920]  to my iPhone, it's just dumb as a brick in terms of like in a field of multiple people,
[35:26.920 --> 35:28.800]  like a crowd of people at a party.
[35:28.800 --> 35:34.120]  Like I took it to someone's birthday party and the choices it makes on which face to
[35:34.120 --> 35:35.720]  focus on are dumb.
[35:35.720 --> 35:42.560]  And it's like, yeah, using cameras like that, you need to be a photographer and it's nice.
[35:42.560 --> 35:46.700]  And I can do things on the Rico that the touch screen, it doesn't have a viewfinder, which
[35:46.700 --> 35:52.160]  is an interesting design decision about the Rico's, but for the way my eyes work at my
[35:52.160 --> 35:56.880]  age now and with the problems I've had, I actually don't want a viewfinder, even though
[35:56.880 --> 35:58.480]  I know why serious photographers do.
[35:58.480 --> 36:02.960]  So I like just using the touch screen for it, but you can touch and you can tap on a
[36:02.960 --> 36:08.280]  person when it guesses the wrong person to auto focus on, tap on the other person, and
[36:08.280 --> 36:11.400]  then it'll stick on that person as you move around.
[36:11.400 --> 36:14.840]  But I need to be the photographer who's making these choices.
[36:14.840 --> 36:21.440]  It's what really jumped out buying a new, well-regarded standalone camera this year
[36:21.440 --> 36:29.160]  is how many decisions the iPhone makes automatically that are what I want it to do, just without
[36:29.160 --> 36:30.160]  me doing anything.
[36:30.160 --> 36:34.320]  It's like, huh, every single time I pointed at a crowd of people at a party, the iPhone
[36:34.320 --> 36:36.160]  picks the right face to focus on.
[36:36.160 --> 36:37.160]  totally.
[36:37.160 --> 36:41.880]  And you know, it's a weird situation because I think in the past when you bought a new
[36:41.880 --> 36:47.920]  camera and you got a new feature, the feature was very overtly like better and new and clever
[36:47.920 --> 36:52.200]  or enabled some thing that you couldn't do before.
[36:52.200 --> 36:56.640]  And I think that behavior, that user behavior became very normalized.
[36:56.640 --> 37:01.000]  So like in the camera, when I used to sell cameras and consumer electronics, and like
[37:01.000 --> 37:06.020]  in that game, you very quickly were like, you realized that a lot of people made their
[37:06.020 --> 37:09.760]  buying decisions on a number go up, right?
[37:09.760 --> 37:14.040]  Like big number, number go up, I'm going to buy this new camera, it's got a bigger number
[37:14.040 --> 37:15.040]  on the box.
[37:15.040 --> 37:19.320]  And that was in, you know, it's very heavily like the retail boxes for like a Pentax digital
[37:19.320 --> 37:22.100]  camera or a Canon digital camera.
[37:22.100 --> 37:25.080]  Just they had a larger megapixel number on the box and people are like, Oh, what about
[37:25.080 --> 37:26.080]  that one?
[37:26.080 --> 37:27.080]  Right.
[37:27.080 --> 37:31.480]  And then at some point you started having to tell them, Hey, you know, above 10 megapixels
[37:31.480 --> 37:37.260]  to 12 megapixels, it's mostly BS because you know, you're getting more pixels, but it's
[37:37.260 --> 37:40.680]  actually noisier and you're going to get a better image from this because the sensor's
[37:40.680 --> 37:41.680]  larger, blah, blah, blah.
[37:41.680 --> 37:42.680]  Right.
[37:42.680 --> 37:43.680]  That's the education part of it.
[37:43.680 --> 37:48.400]  If you were like actually a, a good sales or nice salesman, an honest one, otherwise
[37:48.400 --> 37:50.880]  you sell the bigger one because it's the new one and you get more commission.
[37:50.880 --> 37:51.880]  Right.
[37:51.880 --> 37:52.880]  It's more expensive.
[37:52.880 --> 37:53.880]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[37:53.880 --> 37:57.800]  You get a big from the company too, because like, Ken's like, Oh, here's our new camera.
[37:57.800 --> 38:00.600]  We'll give you 20 bucks every time you sell one of these and you're like, okay, well that's
[38:00.600 --> 38:01.600]  the one I'm selling.
[38:01.600 --> 38:02.760]  I don't care how good it is.
[38:02.760 --> 38:03.760]  Let me sell you.
[38:03.760 --> 38:06.140]  Let me sell you a Canon branded shoulder strap as well.
[38:06.140 --> 38:07.140]  That's it.
[38:07.140 --> 38:08.140]  Yeah.
[38:08.140 --> 38:09.980]  The more accessories you sell, that's where the profit is.
[38:09.980 --> 38:15.520]  Profit on cameras is like 13 to 17% and then the accessories were like 39% profit, right?
[38:15.520 --> 38:17.080]  So it's like very easy.
[38:17.080 --> 38:22.720]  You got into that world and it was very difficult when the transitioning time came to like,
[38:22.720 --> 38:27.260]  Hey, we've sort of maxed out the amount of pixels we need and we really need to focus
[38:27.260 --> 38:31.280]  on like the deliverables here, like the light gathering and all of that stuff.
[38:31.280 --> 38:33.280]  The conversation got more complex, right?
[38:33.280 --> 38:38.800]  And I think Apple's in that place where if you take it traditionally, if you had a photographer
[38:38.800 --> 38:43.920]  who was very serious about their craft in the digital world, I'm talking about, I straddled
[38:43.920 --> 38:45.360]  the gap between film and digital.
[38:45.360 --> 38:49.720]  So I shot my first weddings on film and then shot someone digital after that.
[38:49.720 --> 38:56.040]  And the, the digital conversation really came down to like, Hey, I'm serious about my craft.
[38:56.040 --> 38:58.640]  I'm not shooting JPEG anyway.
[38:58.640 --> 39:01.160]  Like I'll shoot raw or raw plus JPEG, right?
[39:01.160 --> 39:04.000]  Just to have a JPEG as culling material.
[39:04.000 --> 39:08.600]  Because back then even photography tools like eventually Lightroom or the tools that came
[39:08.600 --> 39:13.520]  before it or aperture or whatever, it took a hell of a long time for them to even display
[39:13.520 --> 39:14.520]  a raw image.
[39:14.520 --> 39:19.960]  Like people forget, like if you were culling your images, taking a batch of say 700 images
[39:19.960 --> 39:24.560]  you shot at a wedding and trying to win those down to the good ones, it would take you hours
[39:24.560 --> 39:28.400]  just to go through them because of the processing power and like displaying them.
[39:28.400 --> 39:32.960]  So you shot raw plus JPEG at the time and use the JPEGs to cull them.
[39:32.960 --> 39:36.400]  But if you were serious, you were shooting raw.
[39:36.400 --> 39:40.640]  And when you shot the raw image, you had more raw material to work from.
[39:40.640 --> 39:44.040]  Obviously you could choose what band of the exposure you wanted.
[39:44.040 --> 39:45.400]  You got a little bit more data.
[39:45.400 --> 39:50.360]  You would generally underexpose them slightly so that you, you got your, your shadow detail
[39:50.360 --> 39:52.160]  because you could always, or your highlight detail.
[39:52.160 --> 39:56.400]  So you can always bring back your shadow detail or, or share, obscure it, obscure it a bit,
[39:56.400 --> 39:57.860]  make it a little bit more moody.
[39:57.860 --> 39:59.040]  But you wanted that highlight detail.
[39:59.040 --> 40:00.400]  You didn't want to lose it, right?
[40:00.400 --> 40:09.680]  So these days you take an iPhone, if you shoot raw, you had better really care because the
[40:09.680 --> 40:14.240]  fact is, is that the raw images from the iPhone actually looked demonstrably worse for the
[40:14.240 --> 40:15.240]  most part.
[40:15.240 --> 40:18.400]  And you've got to do a lot of work and I'm not saying it's not a great workflow and there
[40:18.400 --> 40:22.460]  are wonderful tools out there now that allow you to do great things with raw, but even
[40:22.460 --> 40:29.080]  those tools are doing a hell of a lot for you to like make that raw image look anywhere
[40:29.080 --> 40:32.680]  near as good as frankly, the JPEG does coming out of the camera.
[40:32.680 --> 40:34.960]  And like the raw image offers you more information.
[40:34.960 --> 40:40.200]  And for those who want to print larger sizes or get really specific about exposure, it's
[40:40.200 --> 40:41.200]  still there.
[40:41.200 --> 40:45.860]  And Apple clearly cares about it because they've invented new raw formats and new pipelines
[40:45.860 --> 40:48.980]  for raw images and new ways to deal with those.
[40:48.980 --> 40:51.320]  And they genuinely clearly care.
[40:51.320 --> 40:57.360]  However, for 98% of people, even encroaching a good chunk of the people who really care
[40:57.360 --> 41:03.160]  about pictures, like a URI or even above us who like still print a lot and maybe even
[41:03.160 --> 41:08.000]  display their photos, you got to really care to shoot in raw because the computational
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.140]  pipeline is so good.
[41:10.140 --> 41:15.320]  And when you take a raw image and compare it against like the JPEG or HEAC image that
[41:15.320 --> 41:19.920]  comes out of the camera pipeline now, you're like, holy crap, like this raw image looks
[41:19.920 --> 41:20.920]  terrible.
[41:20.920 --> 41:26.160]  And you realize how much work is being put into making it look pretty amazing.
[41:26.160 --> 41:28.360]  And their choices are pretty solid.
[41:28.360 --> 41:30.160]  They're pretty sound.
[41:30.160 --> 41:31.920]  What did you shoot on your Disneyland trip?
[41:31.920 --> 41:33.720]  Did you shoot pro wrong?
[41:33.720 --> 41:34.720]  No.
[41:34.720 --> 41:36.480]  Well, yes, some right.
[41:36.480 --> 41:41.920]  I definitely wanted to take some so that I could compare them and see how the comparison
[41:41.920 --> 41:42.920]  was.
[41:42.920 --> 41:47.520]  The out of camera raw stuff looks really good because Apple does a lot of work now because
[41:47.520 --> 41:53.720]  I think the original raw pipeline that they had before pro raw was very, very, very raw.
[41:53.720 --> 41:58.160]  Like you ton of noise, especially in low light and all this stuff, but they have created
[41:58.160 --> 41:59.640]  a new raw format for that reason.
[41:59.640 --> 42:00.640]  Yeah.
[42:00.640 --> 42:03.840]  I remember when they first year they offered draw, I forget how many years ago it was,
[42:03.840 --> 42:09.040]  but I shot a couple of side by sides or maybe I forget if you let you shoot JPEG plus raw,
[42:09.040 --> 42:14.180]  but the comparison was shocking, but it was almost like a photography lesson.
[42:14.180 --> 42:17.480]  Like this literally, this is all we're doing for you.
[42:17.480 --> 42:18.480]  Right.
[42:18.480 --> 42:20.680]  This is literally the raw sensor image.
[42:20.680 --> 42:21.800]  This is what weird.
[42:21.800 --> 42:25.280]  This is the garbage we're starting with.
[42:25.280 --> 42:29.760]  And this is what normal people who don't even know what raw is when they just poke at the
[42:29.760 --> 42:31.180]  shutter button on their iPhone.
[42:31.180 --> 42:32.680]  We're giving them this from that.
[42:32.680 --> 42:37.200]  And it's like, wow, that is, yeah, it's like showing somebody a tree that fell in the forest
[42:37.200 --> 42:40.440]  and then showing them a glossy dining room table.
[42:40.440 --> 42:41.840]  Yeah, exactly.
[42:41.840 --> 42:42.840]  Right.
[42:42.840 --> 42:43.840]  Right.
[42:43.840 --> 42:44.840]  Right.
[42:44.840 --> 42:52.040]  It's like a log with bugs crawling all over it and bark to be a trip.
[42:52.040 --> 42:55.800]  And here's a $5,000 finely crafted dining room table.
[42:55.800 --> 42:56.800]  Yes, exactly.
[42:56.800 --> 42:57.800]  Uh-huh.
[42:57.800 --> 42:58.800]  And you wrote about this better than I did.
[42:58.800 --> 43:02.920]  I actually had to issue a correction to my review because I botched it.
[43:02.920 --> 43:13.440]  I should've known better that it's from effectively from 1.0 to 1.9, you always get 2.4 megapixel
[43:13.440 --> 43:16.000]  JPEGs in the default mode.
[43:16.000 --> 43:23.880]  And then once you go to 2.0, then you're getting an exact center, 12 megapixel image off the
[43:23.880 --> 43:24.880]  sensor.
[43:24.880 --> 43:29.320]  And that's why 2.0 is still a separate button in the interface, right?
[43:29.320 --> 43:37.240]  That's why the button for 1X is the one that now toggles between 24, 28, 35 equivalents,
[43:37.240 --> 43:41.440]  which is 1.0, 1.2, 1.5.
[43:41.440 --> 43:45.160]  But that feature, you wrote about it so well.
[43:45.160 --> 43:46.160]  Even more...
[43:46.160 --> 43:50.360]  It's like, yes, just read these three paragraphs in Matthew's review and it'll explain this
[43:50.360 --> 43:51.360]  to you.
[43:51.360 --> 43:53.700]  But it's so misunderstood.
[43:53.700 --> 43:55.400]  It is not a digital crop.
[43:55.400 --> 44:02.040]  So when you're shooting 35 millimeter, quote unquote, 35 millimeter at 1.5 X in the iPhone
[44:02.040 --> 44:07.520]  15 Pro, you're not getting a center crop from the 24 millimeter thing.
[44:07.520 --> 44:14.160]  They're still using the whole 48 megapixel sensor for the quad pixels for one way of
[44:14.160 --> 44:15.880]  imaging for light.
[44:15.880 --> 44:18.520]  And then they're using a crop.
[44:18.520 --> 44:22.160]  You've got the exact size to get the 35 millimeter framing.
[44:22.160 --> 44:25.120]  And it's a legit 24 megapixel image.
[44:25.120 --> 44:26.120]  Yeah.
[44:26.120 --> 44:29.000]  I mean, the raw images tell the tale, right?
[44:29.000 --> 44:36.000]  So if you look at the raw images, the raw crop for the 24 millimeter, the base, which
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.880]  we consider to be the base 1X, this is your standard lens.
[44:39.880 --> 44:41.440]  It's 48 megapixels, right?
[44:41.440 --> 44:47.440]  That's how much information is getting delivered to you, which is effectively all of it, right?
[44:47.440 --> 44:52.800]  It's like, hey, this is your 1X, 1X means something in nomenclature.
[44:52.800 --> 44:55.260]  And that nomenclature is one to one, right?
[44:55.260 --> 44:58.480]  It's like you're getting the whole sensor in joy.
[44:58.480 --> 45:06.700]  And now obviously we know that it's taking that frame and combining it with a cropped
[45:06.700 --> 45:11.620]  or lower pixel, not cropped, excuse me, I should banish the word, but a lower pixel
[45:11.620 --> 45:18.680]  count, combining the quad pixels for light gathering purposes, along with other exposures
[45:18.680 --> 45:23.500]  and smashing them into one exposure for you every time you pop the shutter button to give
[45:23.500 --> 45:24.500]  you a JPEG.
[45:24.500 --> 45:28.960]  In raw format, you could see, hey, it's taking 48 megapixels.
[45:28.960 --> 45:34.920]  And then it goes down to 35 and then 24, and 35 megapixels and then 24 megapixels, delivering
[45:34.920 --> 45:41.840]  you basically like the raw amount of pixels that that focal length can cover with its
[45:41.840 --> 45:43.680]  image square or image rectangle.
[45:43.680 --> 45:44.680]  That's it.
[45:44.680 --> 45:45.680]  Right.
[45:45.680 --> 45:46.680]  And you mentioned it.
[45:46.680 --> 45:47.680]  I mentioned it.
[45:47.680 --> 45:52.160]  I'm not sure where I'm going to, I still haven't settled on where my default is going
[45:52.160 --> 45:53.160]  to be.
[45:53.160 --> 45:57.720]  If I wrote in my review, I might set it to 35 and I still think I might change that actually
[45:57.720 --> 46:04.560]  this weekend after we record, I've been rocking the 1.2, the 28 millimeter as my default,
[46:04.560 --> 46:09.360]  but I'm like you, I think 24, I'm glad it's there and I understand why the lens
[46:09.360 --> 46:10.680]  goes that wide.
[46:10.680 --> 46:14.960]  But as the main thing I'm shooting all the time, it's too wide, right?
[46:14.960 --> 46:24.300]  There's a bit of a fish eye aspect to going that wide and it makes scenes look a little
[46:24.300 --> 46:27.820]  unnatural to my eye as a photographer, right?
[46:27.820 --> 46:32.880]  And I know that famously 50 millimeters is considered normal, the equivalent.
[46:32.880 --> 46:37.440]  That's the nifty 50, and it's really bang for the buck, the best camera lens anybody
[46:37.440 --> 46:38.440]  could ever buy.
[46:38.440 --> 46:43.480]  Back in the day, the advice was, and I still think it was great, it still is great advice
[46:43.480 --> 46:49.880]  if you're getting serious and getting like a DSLR, just get the cheap consumer 50 millimeter
[46:49.880 --> 46:55.320]  lens, put it on the camera and don't take that lens off for months, just shoot everything
[46:55.320 --> 46:59.560]  with it and zoom with your feet, zoom with your feet and learn everything you can about
[46:59.560 --> 47:04.080]  shooting at this normal perspective, which they call it normal because it's the best
[47:04.080 --> 47:06.880]  simulation of what we see with our eyes.
[47:06.880 --> 47:11.200]  It doesn't seem zoomed in or telephoto and it's not wide.
[47:11.200 --> 47:14.920]  Going all the way to 24 is really pretty wide to me.
[47:14.920 --> 47:18.780]  So I love this and I love that I'm not sacrificing image quality.
[47:18.780 --> 47:24.200]  To me, 35 is almost the start of the normal range in my opinion.
[47:24.200 --> 47:30.840]  I know 50 is supposed to be specific, but to me at 35, I look at an image of like a
[47:30.840 --> 47:37.000]  room or like an outdoor scene and it doesn't look to me fish eyed at all.
[47:37.000 --> 47:41.600]  I know it is a little compared to 50 and I have that Ricoh that shoots at 40, which is
[47:41.600 --> 47:48.840]  a little bit closer to normal, but to me that is a magic range of just photos that just
[47:48.840 --> 47:53.320]  look as natural as you can possibly imagine them looking.
[47:53.320 --> 47:59.200]  I love it and effectively what Apple's done is everybody knows digital zoom is bad.
[47:59.200 --> 48:00.880]  Optical zoom is good, right?
[48:00.880 --> 48:05.280]  Optical means it's real and digital means it's interpolated in some way and yes, it
[48:05.280 --> 48:09.920]  might be better to digitally zoom in than to not get the image at all.
[48:09.920 --> 48:14.140]  I mean, everybody's done this at school events when you're the parent halfway back
[48:14.140 --> 48:20.080]  the auditorium and you got to zoom in somehow to pick out your kid on stage, but effectively
[48:20.080 --> 48:25.680]  with computational photography, they're using computational photography to get effectively
[48:25.680 --> 48:34.060]  optical zoom from 1.0 to 1.5, which is unbelievable because that is the, to me, it is a super
[48:34.060 --> 48:35.560]  useful range.
[48:35.560 --> 48:40.920]  It doesn't sound like a lot, oh, it's just from 1.0 to 1.5, but that's the main range
[48:40.920 --> 48:49.840]  people shoot most pictures at and they've effectively not faked it, but digitized, computerized
[48:49.840 --> 48:55.960]  optical zoom in that super useful common area, which is just a remarkable achievement.
[48:55.960 --> 49:04.560]  Yeah, it is, and it's such a clever way to do it too that the whole reason I shot RAW
[49:04.560 --> 49:08.520]  when I was playing around with those zoom levels is I was like, wait a minute, how are
[49:08.520 --> 49:09.520]  they doing this?
[49:09.520 --> 49:10.520]  Right?
[49:10.520 --> 49:11.520]  Yeah.
[49:11.520 --> 49:14.660]  And like, wait, somebody in a briefing was like, it's not digital zoom.
[49:14.660 --> 49:17.360]  And I wrote that in my notes and I'm like, wait a minute, why?
[49:17.360 --> 49:18.480]  Why isn't it?
[49:18.480 --> 49:19.480]  Like how?
[49:19.480 --> 49:22.180]  And it's just a clever and it's like obviously a by-product.
[49:22.180 --> 49:26.380]  They could do it this year because they introduced the 48 megapixel last year.
[49:26.380 --> 49:31.920]  And they were like, Hey, we can, we are confident now in our ability to use this, the full 48
[49:31.920 --> 49:32.920]  megapixels to get you an image.
[49:32.920 --> 49:36.980]  And they came up with this enhanced version of their image pipeline to allow, to sandwich
[49:36.980 --> 49:37.980]  these images together.
[49:37.980 --> 49:43.900]  And it's like, it's, it's super awesome when they're able to deliver kind of like more
[49:43.900 --> 49:49.240]  consumer choice with essentially zero compromise in this way, because it's always going to
[49:49.240 --> 49:50.800]  be 24 megapixels or above.
[49:50.800 --> 49:51.800]  Right?
[49:51.800 --> 49:53.760]  And there's no reason that they could do it.
[49:53.760 --> 49:59.680]  And like that, the two X to me is because of the crop nature of the two X, because it
[49:59.680 --> 50:02.200]  is a crop, it's a 12 megapixel image.
[50:02.200 --> 50:07.460]  I think it's it makes it a far less appealing lens for me in general, but like the ability
[50:07.460 --> 50:12.680]  for them to deliver all of these optical choices down below, nobody was asking for that.
[50:12.680 --> 50:13.680]  No.
[50:13.680 --> 50:14.680]  You know what I mean?
[50:14.680 --> 50:20.880]  Like nobody, nobody was like Apple, you must find a way to deliver me any one of these
[50:20.880 --> 50:26.600]  three lenses at perfect quality with no rasterization, no interpolation.
[50:26.600 --> 50:29.920]  And because I'm a photographer and I care, right?
[50:29.920 --> 50:33.640]  Like when I say nobody, I meant like the vast majority of people, maybe photographers were
[50:33.640 --> 50:38.040]  like, wouldn't it be cool if like blah, blah, blah, with no expectations that they would
[50:38.040 --> 50:39.040]  deliver this.
[50:39.040 --> 50:40.040]  Right?
[50:40.040 --> 50:43.920]  Like there's no way anybody in advance was saying like, Oh man, a photographer nerds
[50:43.920 --> 50:49.360]  dream would be able to default to 24 or 35 and like their personal preference without
[50:49.360 --> 50:52.200]  having to compromise anything, right?
[50:52.200 --> 50:56.800]  Because we did not expect them to prioritize that necessarily, no matter how nerdy Apple's
[50:56.800 --> 51:02.420]  got on cameras over the years, this is a true like camera nerd feature, like a photographer's
[51:02.420 --> 51:03.420]  feature.
[51:03.420 --> 51:05.720]  And the vast majority of people may never take advantage of it.
[51:05.720 --> 51:08.960]  They'll probably just hit the one and take a picture at 24.
[51:08.960 --> 51:09.960]  That's great.
[51:09.960 --> 51:13.320]  Like for them to do this, it just, it's a dedication, right?
[51:13.320 --> 51:18.560]  To like the, what they view as making this as like a real camera.
[51:18.560 --> 51:23.840]  You talk about it having seven lenses right now, even if you argue that it's five lenses
[51:23.840 --> 51:29.800]  because the macro obviously is the ultra wide and the two X is not a quote real in quote
[51:29.800 --> 51:30.800]  lens.
[51:30.800 --> 51:31.800]  Right?
[51:31.800 --> 51:38.000]  I think that if five lenses in a single device, all of those offering optical quality is pretty
[51:38.000 --> 51:39.000]  cool.
[51:39.000 --> 51:40.160]  That's pretty cool.
[51:40.160 --> 51:45.120]  And I think that's a hundred percent just cool as a camera person, as a photography
[51:45.120 --> 51:46.720]  person, they take that seriously.
[51:46.720 --> 51:47.720]  Yeah.
[51:47.720 --> 51:53.360]  If you just shoot 1.0, cause that's a default and then you're in photos afterwards and you're
[51:53.360 --> 51:57.240]  looking at it and you're like, there's some stuff at the edge of the frame that I would
[51:57.240 --> 52:03.040]  like to crop out the edge of a sign or somebody's shoulder is over on the right edge of the
[52:03.040 --> 52:08.800]  frame and it would, I'd like to crop that out and you just crop out just a little bit.
[52:08.800 --> 52:11.240]  You're still getting a very high quality image, right?
[52:11.240 --> 52:13.480]  You're going down from 24 megapixels.
[52:13.480 --> 52:18.000]  Let's say you crop it to like, I don't know, 19 megapixels or something like that.
[52:18.000 --> 52:19.360]  That's plenty of pixels, right?
[52:19.360 --> 52:23.960]  And that cropping in post is there's so much to work with there.
[52:23.960 --> 52:29.200]  There has been with these 12 megapixel images that iPhones have shot for years or any high
[52:29.200 --> 52:30.760]  end phone camera, right?
[52:30.760 --> 52:35.440]  There's there's, that's one of the nice things about 12 megapixel images is you can crop
[52:35.440 --> 52:41.520]  afterwards and still have a very nice overall resolution to the image.
[52:41.520 --> 52:44.680]  But the fact that if you know what you're, if you know this in advance and you notice
[52:44.680 --> 52:50.480]  the obstruction in the viewfinder before you shoot that you can tap one button and get
[52:50.480 --> 52:52.420]  it optically, it's just amazing.
[52:52.420 --> 52:56.800]  One thing I saw and I wanted to test like, all right, I think I understand how this works.
[52:56.800 --> 53:01.680]  I believe them and Apple doesn't usually bullshit or never bullshits about the camera stuff.
[53:01.680 --> 53:03.040]  But you know, let me see an example.
[53:03.040 --> 53:06.820]  One of the things I took when I was out and about, I had, I, this is what I usually do
[53:06.820 --> 53:12.800]  is I walk around the city with the two new pro cameras, the, well, if there's a camera
[53:12.800 --> 53:14.520]  difference, otherwise I'll just have one.
[53:14.520 --> 53:20.280]  But because there was a five X and a three X this year, two pro cameras and my last year's
[53:20.280 --> 53:22.080]  14 pro for comparison.
[53:22.080 --> 53:26.080]  So it's very, gets very confusing to me very quickly.
[53:26.080 --> 53:27.600]  So I wrote my review.
[53:27.600 --> 53:32.200]  I put different textured cases on all the phones so that I can feel them apart in hand.
[53:32.200 --> 53:36.960]  But I took a picture of a food cart here in Philadelphia out in front of our city hall.
[53:36.960 --> 53:42.720]  Typical aluminum food cart that, you know, at the end of the day, whoever runs the food
[53:42.720 --> 53:45.400]  cart hooks up to his car and tows away.
[53:45.400 --> 53:46.520]  It made out of aluminum.
[53:46.520 --> 53:48.960]  You know what the look I'm looking at.
[53:48.960 --> 53:54.200]  But on the side, there's like a vent and it's like the exhaust for the grill inside the
[53:54.200 --> 53:55.260]  little food cart.
[53:55.260 --> 54:01.740]  And it's like a rectangular vent, like a mesh.
[54:01.740 --> 54:05.040]  And from the distance I shot, cause I wasn't trying to get real close to it.
[54:05.040 --> 54:11.240]  I was shooting the scene of the people lining up to order food on the 12 megapixel image
[54:11.240 --> 54:16.960]  from last year's 14 pro the, the mesh of this grill was just gray.
[54:16.960 --> 54:18.420]  It just was no detail.
[54:18.420 --> 54:24.160]  And with the exacts from this, my feet on the same spot with the 15 pro, if I wanted
[54:24.160 --> 54:27.700]  to zoom in, I could see the exact texture of this grill.
[54:27.700 --> 54:30.480]  And I was like, this is totally legit.
[54:30.480 --> 54:37.400]  There's no way that any kind of interpolation could ever get that detail out of a 12 megapixel
[54:37.400 --> 54:38.400]  image.
[54:38.400 --> 54:43.120]  So like how often does that matter where you capture an image and you turns out like Zapruder
[54:43.120 --> 54:48.880]  style that there's some kind of detail in the frame that you really like, Oh my God,
[54:48.880 --> 54:51.680]  was there somebody famous in this restaurant behind you?
[54:51.680 --> 54:52.680]  Look at this.
[54:52.680 --> 54:55.320]  Is that the person that image quality is there?
[54:55.320 --> 55:00.340]  It is not a 12 megapixel image that is fakie faked up to 24.
[55:00.340 --> 55:04.020]  It is like 1.5 X better quality.
[55:04.020 --> 55:09.640]  I know you think out there, wait, isn't 24 double 12 megapixels?
[55:09.640 --> 55:12.260]  No, because you're multiplying in two dimensions.
[55:12.260 --> 55:16.520]  It's like each dimension is sort of one and a half and then you multiply and you get 24,
[55:16.520 --> 55:22.400]  but it's still, that's, it is still, it's more detail and it's, it is legit.
[55:22.400 --> 55:27.180]  Let me take a break and then we'll come back and talk about the, the bane of my existence,
[55:27.180 --> 55:28.600]  that damn five X zoom.
[55:28.600 --> 55:32.880]  Let me tell you about memberful, memberful.
[55:32.880 --> 55:41.200]  If you are a creator, they are the place to go to create a membership system for your
[55:41.200 --> 55:45.000]  show, your website, whatever it is you do.
[55:45.000 --> 55:49.640]  If you want to run a membership system, memberful is a company that runs a service.
[55:49.640 --> 55:50.960]  This is all they do.
[55:50.960 --> 55:55.160]  You always have full control and ownership of your audience, your brand.
[55:55.160 --> 56:01.120]  It's not putting memberful first and you become your, your, your listeners, readers, whatever
[56:01.120 --> 56:05.240]  they are, become memberful users and you're just one sub brand there.
[56:05.240 --> 56:06.240]  It's your brand.
[56:06.240 --> 56:07.240]  You own it.
[56:07.240 --> 56:08.240]  You own the membership list.
[56:08.240 --> 56:11.040]  If you ever want to move somewhere else, you can take the list with you.
[56:11.040 --> 56:12.660]  It fades into the background.
[56:12.660 --> 56:18.800]  So your business, your brand is front and center and they seamlessly integrate with
[56:18.800 --> 56:26.000]  the tools you already use, including MailChimp, WordPress, Stripe, discord, and more.
[56:26.000 --> 56:27.000]  These are your accounts.
[56:27.000 --> 56:28.040]  They just plug into them.
[56:28.040 --> 56:32.140]  So you want to run like a discord server for your members where only the paying members
[56:32.140 --> 56:33.140]  get in.
[56:33.140 --> 56:36.000]  They've got the integration all hooked up automatically.
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.760]  So it's not something you have to code up or anything like that.
[56:38.760 --> 56:40.040]  You just get it.
[56:40.040 --> 56:43.500]  If you're looking to add membership to your existing business, you want a solution that
[56:43.500 --> 56:45.680]  works with your existing technology.
[56:45.680 --> 56:50.060]  So you can launch a new revenue stream without rebuilding your entire tech stack.
[56:50.060 --> 56:54.140]  They have everything you need to run a membership program, easy to use checkout with Apple pay
[56:54.140 --> 56:59.220]  support and easy to use member portal so that people can update their email address or something
[56:59.220 --> 57:00.220]  like that.
[57:00.220 --> 57:04.180]  Or if they forget their password, it's all built in so that they can go to the portal
[57:04.180 --> 57:05.180]  and get that.
[57:05.180 --> 57:09.280]  They get transaction emails with the receipts, everything you'd want.
[57:09.280 --> 57:13.860]  And you, as the creator, you get a member management dashboard so you can focus on what
[57:13.860 --> 57:14.860]  you do best.
[57:14.860 --> 57:17.340]  So if you call your members and somebody, you know, you want to see something about
[57:17.340 --> 57:21.100]  somebody's membership, you get a great dashboard interface to it.
[57:21.100 --> 57:25.820]  They give you analytics with an easy to use in-depth view of what's working, what's not
[57:25.820 --> 57:30.160]  where you should double down everything you could possibly want and including things like
[57:30.160 --> 57:35.360]  creating member only podcasts and stuff like that, using your existing podcast hosting.
[57:35.360 --> 57:39.140]  So you can start earning more revenue right there with your podcast.
[57:39.140 --> 57:40.140]  It's a great service.
[57:40.140 --> 57:43.540]  I've signed up for more memberful things than I can count on one hand.
[57:43.540 --> 57:44.780]  I'm pretty sure.
[57:44.780 --> 57:46.340]  It's just a great service.
[57:46.340 --> 57:48.780]  Where do you go to find out more?
[57:48.780 --> 57:57.540]  You go to memberful.com slash talk show memberful.com slash talk show.
[57:57.540 --> 57:58.540]  Go there now.
[57:58.540 --> 58:02.980]  Sign up and use that URL and they'll know you came from here.
[58:02.980 --> 58:05.540]  What's your take on the five X lens on the pro max?
[58:05.540 --> 58:08.100]  Okay, so I love it.
[58:08.100 --> 58:10.100]  It's my favorite.
[58:10.100 --> 58:11.100]  It's my baby.
[58:11.100 --> 58:16.580]  I'm probably going to end up shooting 70% of my images with this lens over the next
[58:16.580 --> 58:17.580]  year.
[58:17.580 --> 58:25.540]  I know that because I shot 60% of my images with the three X lens over the past year.
[58:25.540 --> 58:29.940]  Obviously, you can go into Photos app and you can filter by lenses.
[58:29.940 --> 58:34.420]  I did a little bit of that work a couple of years ago when I started reviewing the telephotos
[58:34.420 --> 58:40.100]  and I wanted to see exactly how bad my telephoto addiction was.
[58:40.100 --> 58:42.220]  It turns out that I'm just that kind of person.
[58:42.220 --> 58:46.500]  Now I know a lot of people aren't so I'm not prescribing it or saying anybody else will
[58:46.500 --> 58:47.940]  be this way.
[58:47.940 --> 58:55.220]  I have a special sort of illness that sort of makes me love that kind of work.
[58:55.220 --> 59:01.660]  So the reason that telephoto for me is so fun and so good when it's a good one is that
[59:01.660 --> 59:06.060]  I'm a huge margins guy.
[59:06.060 --> 59:09.780]  Watching your margins is like a photography term used to be used a lot in the old days.
[59:09.780 --> 59:14.940]  I don't think as much anymore for digital photography reasons, but watching your margins
[59:14.940 --> 59:19.460]  was really important on film because if you wanted to use the entire frame and print the
[59:19.460 --> 59:25.740]  entire frame, you had to watch your edges of your frame in the viewfinder.
[59:25.740 --> 59:29.820]  This is why one-to-one viewfinders are so critically important to film photography and
[59:29.820 --> 59:34.820]  why prism style viewfinders were generally accepted to be the best by professionals.
[59:34.820 --> 59:38.860]  That's why SLRs came into existence because when you look through the lens, you want to
[59:38.860 --> 59:42.940]  make sure that at the edges of your frame, all the way around, there's nothing intruding.
[59:42.940 --> 59:47.500]  No weird branches coming in, no things poking on the edge or somebody isn't running off
[59:47.500 --> 59:52.300]  of the edge of the frame because it leads the eye out of the frame instead of keeping
[59:52.300 --> 59:56.380]  it in the frame, especially for things like portraits, right, which portrait photography
[59:56.380 --> 59:57.780]  or wedding photography, any of that.
[59:57.780 --> 59:58.780]  You want to watch the edges, right?
[59:58.780 --> 59:59.780]  You got to watch your edges.
[59:59.780 --> 01:00:01.260]  That's what margins mean.
[01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:07.100]  And so the ability to watch your margins became much less of a problem with digital because
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:11.660]  people forget this, but with film, cropping your photos was hard.
[01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:12.700]  It was tough.
[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:18.280]  You had to tell the person processing, especially for pro photographers who like doing a bunch
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:23.340]  of photos, you had to tell your processor, hey, on frame, this frame, because you had
[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:26.820]  to get them printed first, really, before you saw anything.
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:32.720]  And then you would say, hey, on frame three or frame 25 here, can you crop this for me?
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:40.620]  When they put the negative back in the machine, go into their software, I mean, this is way
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:44.400]  farther down the line than the old, I'm not talking like back when you had an enlarger
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.160]  and you had to crank a wheel, right, which I did that too, right?
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.340]  That was my era as well.
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:56.020]  But even when processing machines got better, they had to go in and manually tap, tap, tap
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:57.300]  on the zoom and then print it out.
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:58.300]  Oh, I don't like that.
[01:00:58.300 --> 01:00:59.300]  It's a little too far.
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:00.300]  Okay, let me do it back.
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:04.700]  So like three prints later, several dollars later, whatever, you got yourself a crop that
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:06.240]  you were satisfied with.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:10.460]  And then the person was like, oh, I'd love this in a 60 by 20 and you're like, I had
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:14.660]  to crop this 50% because the margins, it's going to look terrible at 60 by 20, right?
[01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:18.660]  And so like, I think there's, they take it for granted thing about the margins, right,
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:19.660]  for people.
[01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:25.420]  But for me personally, being able to sort of isolate subjects or choose the framing
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:30.420]  of subjects for me is very potent, it fits with my style of photography.
[01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:34.940]  I like to be able to, to have what I want in the image and not have what I don't want
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:39.580]  in the image right out of the frame or out of the camera, right, rather than cropping
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:41.900]  later or messing around with it later.
[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:48.300]  And so for a photographer like me, for a person like me, this lens is a dream come true because
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:52.320]  it is, it delivers optical quality, 12 megapixel images.
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:58.660]  This is not digital cropping, once again, it uses the exact 12 megapixels at the quote
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:01.420]  unquote center of the sensor, whatever.
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:07.340]  It passes light through the lens and then through a prism and then projects it onto
[01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:10.620]  the 12 megapixels at the center of the frame.
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:14.860]  It does its normal thing where it takes several frames and passes it through the image pipeline,
[01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:21.020]  of course, but it starts with that native sort of raw pixels that you could deal, you
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:22.740]  can use to capture your image.
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:29.420]  And my overall results from it have been so incredibly impressive over this initial testing
[01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:30.420]  period.
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:36.500]  It absolutely blew me away because when Apple first introduced the 2X, it was very much
[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:46.120]  just like, I'm glad this is here, but I regret how, how bad it is, like, I'm glad this exists,
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.620]  but it's rough, you know,
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:51.140]  And you're talking about when 2X was a separate lens.
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.140]  Correct.
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:53.140]  Correct.
[01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:54.140]  Yes.
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:58.460]  When they first introduced the 2X, the separate lens 2X was like, Hey, we have great optics,
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:02.180]  but we know the sensor's not really up to the task and our computational skills are
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:06.060]  not up to the task yet, but we want people to have this option.
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:09.060]  And I think that the camera team was proud of their work at the time.
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:14.660]  And it was certainly an achievement engineering wise to squeeze that lens and all of its optics
[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:15.660]  in.
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:18.900]  And what they ended up realizing is that if we ever want to go beyond that, we have to
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:22.300]  do something different, which is where the Tetra prism design came in.
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:23.940]  Yep.
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:28.860]  I have to say shooting with it, it's number one, I, and I put this in my review.
[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:33.980]  I did the, I did the, I set up the smart groups and photos to count my lens usage over the
[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:34.980]  last year.
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:39.460]  And if you read my review, you saw, I actually used my 3X lens, very little, it was like
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:42.740]  170 out of 2,800 photos.
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:47.080]  So under 10% of my photos are taken with the 3X lens.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.740]  It's just, that's the way I shoot.
[01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:51.620]  And that's why I'm like, I'm getting the phone.
[01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:52.860]  That's the physical size.
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:56.660]  I like, I'm not going for 5X and I don't, I don't regret it.
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:04:03.580]  I really don't, but it does hurt me a little because what I've seen shooting 5X is like,
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:06.220]  I can't believe this is in my pocket.
[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:14.600]  Like I, because I know, I know how physically large and heavy 120 millimeter equivalent
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:15.780]  lenses are.
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:22.320]  And like I told you, I, my, all of the, the camera cameras I've ever bought in my life,
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:29.140]  I have never, because I'm a pro sumer and maybe leaning heavily towards the sumer part
[01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:35.340]  and like street photography type things and never did like amateur portrait photography.
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:39.460]  I would never in a million years volunteer to shoot somebody's wedding, even if it was
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:40.940]  sort of a low key wedding affair.
[01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:44.900]  I'm just not good at that and not good at that type of photography.
[01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:49.380]  So all the camera cameras I've ever bought, all I ever, the only lenses I've ever bought
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:54.260]  for my Canon SLRs were primes and I never bought one longer than 50.
[01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:56.980]  I never even bought like an 80 and 85.
[01:04:56.980 --> 01:05:02.940]  I hovered over the purchase button on an 85 many times, but I'm like, no, I don't want
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:03.940]  it.
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:09.020]  I don't want it on the other camera, but I've always had like 28, 35 and 50 millimeter primes.
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:10.100]  And I did splurge.
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:11.380]  I bought long ago.
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:18.300]  I've got Canon's incredibly heavy and what a waste of money from my skills.
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:25.500]  They're F 1.2 50 millimeter leads, which is, I swear to God, it weighs like 3000 pounds
[01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:29.060]  even though it's very small, but the glass is like insane on it.
[01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:30.060]  Right.
[01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:35.780]  And I could get their F 1.4 for like 300 bucks, but I had to have it.
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:41.060]  I had to have it, but I, but I've never had more throw in a camera than 50 millimeters.
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:45.860]  I've shot with the three X and a three X is a 77 equivalent.
[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:48.940]  And it's just not that much more than 50.
[01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:49.940]  I get it.
[01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:54.740]  And I did shoot 170 real images, not like counting test images that I shot while reviewing
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:59.340]  the cameras last year with the three X, but five X is a different game.
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:00.340]  It is it.
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:02.200]  I I've just never had a camera like that.
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:07.360]  And it's like, I'm shooting pictures of random people on the sidewalk, like a paparazzi.
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:10.400]  And it's like, Oh my God, this is like that.
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:14.520]  This person has no idea I'm shooting a photo cause I'm so far away from them, but I'm
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:19.100]  getting like a really clear picture of this person all the way halfway down the block.
[01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:25.620]  It is such an amount of throw and the quality is just, there is no, I don't know that
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:26.620]  it's better.
[01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:31.420]  I don't think it's better quality image quality wise than the three X camera, but
[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:37.100]  it's certainly to my eyes seems on par, which is amazing because it's a lot more
[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:38.100]  throw.
[01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:39.100]  Yeah.
[01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:46.380]  You're talking about like comparing the five X and the pro max to the pro max, to
[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:53.940]  the three X pro three X or, or the 15 pro three X, right?
[01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:58.180]  You know what, I actually ran relatively few comparisons between the 15 pro three X and
[01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.740]  the five X.
[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:00.740]  Maybe I should have run more.
[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:01.740]  I don't know.
[01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:02.740]  Maybe that's, you can only test so much.
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:03.740]  Right.
[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:04.740]  And you only have so many days to do it.
[01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:13.120]  But I did run tests between the iPhone 14 pro three X and the iPhone 15 pro max five
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.120]  X.
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:15.120]  Right.
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:16.120]  Like I did.
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:19.700]  I ran those tests against one another and it's hard to tell why it's better.
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:20.700]  I feel it's better.
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:21.700]  Right.
[01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:22.700]  I feel it actually compare it.
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:23.700]  It's okay.
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:24.700]  It compares right.
[01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:25.700]  Relatively.
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:27.580]  Well, the three X is actually not bad at all.
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:28.580]  Right.
[01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:29.580]  Not, it's not bad.
[01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:30.980]  It's way better than the original two X.
[01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:31.980]  Right.
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:35.100]  But I actually think that it's hard to differentiate.
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:38.820]  I have the one thing I haven't done and I'll just be completely honest with anybody listening
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:39.820]  to this.
[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:41.060]  Like I absolutely have not tested.
[01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:45.260]  So cannot definitively say I shot a raw image, right.
[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:50.360]  A raw, a pro raw image with both of those and then edited them and then determined which
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:51.360]  one I liked better.
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.360]  Right.
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:55.260]  I've never heard the H E I C. What did they call it?
[01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:56.260]  Hike.
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:57.260]  I've never heard them pronounce it.
[01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:58.260]  Hike.
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:07:59.260]  They call it hike.
[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:00.260]  I think.
[01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:01.260]  Heeke.
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:02.260]  Heeke.
[01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:03.260]  Heeke.
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:04.260]  I forget.
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:05.260]  They pronounce it, but I've always said H E I C.
[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:06.260]  Yeah.
[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:07.260]  I've always said H E I C too.
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.260]  And I think it was a total non sequitur when you and I were in a briefing.
[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:10.260]  Yeah.
[01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:11.260]  Somebody pronounced it.
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:12.740]  We're like, wait, that's how you say it?
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:16.180]  Like it would be, it would be like if you're talking to someone in the U S justice department
[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:19.300]  and they started talking about the Phoebe and you're like the Phoebe, what the hell are
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:20.300]  you talking about?
[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:21.300]  And you're like, Oh, the FBI.
[01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:22.300]  Yeah.
[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:23.300]  Right.
[01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:24.700]  And you're like, you call it the Phoebe?
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:25.700]  Yeah.
[01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:27.700]  I think they call it Heeke, right?
[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:28.700]  It was.
[01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:29.700]  Yeah.
[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:30.700]  I can't recall, but yeah.
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:31.700]  Anyhow.
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:36.060]  So long story short, if you compare a Heeke between those two, I definitely like the 15
[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:38.340]  pro max better.
[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:43.380]  However, it's really hard to tell whether that's the image processing pipeline or not.
[01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:44.380]  Right.
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:46.860]  That smart HDR pro is so much better.
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:51.820]  Fine detail at the edges, like backlit situations, high contrast situations.
[01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:53.660]  It's just absolutely crushes it.
[01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:54.980]  It's so much better.
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:58.780]  So it's sometimes hard to tell the difference between is this a processing deal or not.
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:00.660]  And the only way to do that is to run Ross.
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:06.100]  So I can't say, however, if you have a three X now, you're going to love the five X because
[01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:12.640]  it's just more, more telephoto, more choice in framing, and you're not losing any quality.
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:16.500]  It's not like it's like, Hey, congratulations, you got a five X, but you got to take the
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.420]  hit on image quality, right?
[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:20.140]  Like that's just part of the game.
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:25.960]  And I think people would have been not impressed by, but accepting of that, Oh, it's five X,
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:28.380]  but maybe, you know, the image quality is a little iffy.
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:35.220]  But in my opinion, it is very, very, I'm very comfortable saying it is absolutely as good.
[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:40.820]  And honestly, personally comfortable to some degree saying it's better because of the fact
[01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:42.620]  is it's like a percentage thing.
[01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:47.740]  Like you are optically utilizing a certain percentage of the sensor.
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:53.700]  And the more telephoto that you have reaching out and pulling in, you're going to get every
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:59.500]  element of your image, if it's an eyeball or a tree bark patch or whatever is taking
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.060]  up more pixels, right?
[01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:03.060]  So it's going to give you more fine detail.
[01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:07.540]  Let's like a scenario where you can't move your feet to get a better image.
[01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:13.020]  You're the parent and you're at a little league game and you've got a seat in the stands and
[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:18.260]  your kid is up at the plate and you can't move, right.
[01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:22.020]  Or you could, but they're going to say something to you for coming onto the field.
[01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:24.140]  So you frame it.
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:25.140]  We've all done it.
[01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:28.900]  I mean, I've shot pictures like this where with the older iPhones, where if the iPhone's
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:31.920]  the camera you have with it, you just zoom in to where you want to zoom in.
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:39.920]  And if it's digital zoom to some lesser range, you still get a usable image, but you can
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:40.920]  see it.
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:46.500]  I think almost everybody, when you look at it on like your Mac or even an iPad where
[01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:53.180]  you've blown it up to at least 11 inches, you can see the sort of smudginess of digital
[01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:56.460]  zoom to some degree.
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:11:01.380]  In some ways, it's just shocking to me, honestly, a week and a half later, it is just sort of
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:04.620]  shocking that I'm not seeing that from these images.
[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:10.100]  I know I shot them with a phone and I know the subject was so far away from me and I'm
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:12.100]  not seeing, I'm seeing detail.
[01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:15.340]  It's like a binary thing, right?
[01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:17.620]  Like you're getting images.
[01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:21.700]  You wouldn't have gotten before at that quality.
[01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:22.700]  Right.
[01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:23.700]  Yeah.
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:28.100]  And the other thing, and you mentioned it, they definitely mentioned the technical specs.
[01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:34.580]  It's the first camera lens in any iPhone with an optical image stabilization that moves
[01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:38.220]  in three dimensions instead of just two.
[01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:40.600]  I don't know why that's impressive.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:43.540]  It sounds, it must be third dimension is interesting.
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:50.780]  There's obviously not a lot of room inside an iPhone to move in any dimension, but it
[01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:58.740]  must be doing something because that's one of the downsides of longer lenses is they
[01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:00.860]  let in less light.
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:06.420]  This lens is always open at F 2.8, which is pretty good for a long lens, but it's not
[01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:07.420]  that.
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:08.420]  Yeah.
[01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:09.420]  I was super impressed.
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:10.420]  I expected it to be much smaller, to be honest.
[01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:14.900]  So, and that's the prism design kind of at work because it's basically taking that same
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:19.220]  image square and like bouncing it so it doesn't have to pass it through additional lens elements
[01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:22.620]  on its way down, reducing the amount of light that hits it.
[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:30.900]  But back in the day, if you had a 120 millimeter F 2.8 lens, even a big one, a big fat lens,
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:33.940]  super heavy in it, you're shooting on 35 millimeter film.
[01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:39.740]  When the days before optical image stabilization, you couldn't shoot scenes at night with that
[01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:40.740]  lens.
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:41.740]  You just handheld.
[01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:45.780]  I mean, you could like put it on a tripod and do a long exposure, which would get you
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:50.280]  a great image, but it's long exposures, leaving the camera open literally for maybe
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:53.020]  like a second or something like that.
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:55.100]  You can't do that handheld, right?
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:13:01.540]  So, you know, and your Disneyland pictures, you guys were obviously out at night and there's,
[01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:03.620]  it's tough lighting scenarios, right?
[01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:08.220]  Because it is dark because it's night, but there's all sorts of fancy colorful lights
[01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:13.100]  because you're at Disneyland and you would just think intuitively, well, these pictures
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:16.060]  are going to be blurry and they're not, they're, they're sharp.
[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:17.060]  Right?
[01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:18.060]  I, it's, yeah.
[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:23.300]  And like, I, you know, obviously when I was mobile, I, most of my reviewing of the images
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:28.520]  by looking at the images was done on my phones and okay, it's a small screen, even if you
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.000]  zoom in or whatever.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.500]  But once I got home and I was able to like, look at them in photos on my Mac and I opened
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:41.820]  them up and started looking at them, it was just honestly boggling, like how good they
[01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:42.820]  were.
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:49.740]  Like they, I included one image in my review of a nighttime shot of a neon sign taken at
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:56.820]  like 24 millimeters and then another one shot at five X and the difference, I mean the,
[01:13:56.820 --> 01:14:03.660]  the detail that was pulled out in that five X shot, I literally was, I was shocked, like
[01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:08.700]  shocked at it, not in some sort of metaphorical, like, Oh, I was shocked.
[01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:09.700]  It was good.
[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:10.700]  I was literally shocked.
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:11.700]  I was like, what?
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:12.900]  No way, right?
[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:14.180]  Like no way.
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:20.080]  And like, I included a link in my piece to a D and G because I really felt, I wanted
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:25.660]  to make sure that people knew that like, I wasn't just messing around or like exaggerating
[01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:28.740]  for the sake of like making a point in my review.
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:29.940]  Like here's a raw image.
[01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:30.940]  Go look at this thing.
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:36.460]  Like this is super impressive and it is, it's really incredible the amount of detail and
[01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:44.220]  this is a low light scenario, handheld at night where you do not expect that you've
[01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:47.420]  also, but you've also got these bright neon beam.
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:51.100]  I mean, no, it's not really neon anymore, but it's the, it's like flows diner from
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:52.100]  cars I think.
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:53.100]  Right.
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:54.100]  And it's like, yeah.
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:59.580]  So it's just sort of trying to, it's Disney's take on a 1950s style diner with these neon
[01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:01.000]  colorful lights.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.060]  And the thing is when you, your, your image, it's a great, it is a great example because
[01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:10.240]  you zoom in and in addition to the light, not blowing out the image, right?
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:16.900]  You get the color from the lights, like an older camera though, that, that area I think
[01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:22.940]  would have gone white if the rest of the image was exposed properly because it couldn't
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:28.480]  have the dynamic range to capture any of the detail that is dark and looks like night while
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:31.860]  still showing these bright glowing lights.
[01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:38.460]  You get the color of the lights and then within the actual signage, there's like dirt and
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:43.500]  schmutz stuff that plant debris, plant plant debris, and you can see it.
[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:44.960]  It's like, how do you, how is that?
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:50.260]  How is it capturing that when it's right next to this bright glowing light, which should
[01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:52.860]  in my mind, blow that out.
[01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:57.300]  It's like when you talk about going all the way back to 1977, all of the talk about
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:16:01.820]  the star Wars movies, the lightsabers have always been a nightmare because it's, yes,
[01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:02.820]  yes.
[01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:07.700]  And it's like the whole reason Luke's lightsaber is green and return of the Jedi
[01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:08.700]  instead of blue.
[01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:13.540]  It was like, up until that point, good guys had blue and bad guys had red.
[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:19.340]  And then they realized a blue lightsaber because they wanted to show him outdoors in the desert
[01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:21.120]  scene with Jabba the Hutt.
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:25.140]  And they're like, shit, you can't see the lightsaber.
[01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:26.780]  And they're like, well, what if we make it green?
[01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:27.780]  And they're like, okay.
[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:30.060]  But like lightsabers have always been difficult in that way.
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:31.060]  Right.
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:35.660]  And the neon beams at the diner at Disneyland are like lightsabers effectively, right?
[01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:39.860]  And it's like, if it's tough for ILM to fake it, how is a real camera capturing
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:40.860]  this?
[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:41.860]  Yeah.
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:42.860]  Yeah.
[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:46.140]  And like, I saw a lot of those image processing improvements this year, too.
[01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:47.140]  Red is still an issue.
[01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:48.140]  Yeah.
[01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:50.500]  It's still an issue just to be straightforward.
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:52.140]  Because you know what I'm talking about, right?
[01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:59.340]  I'm talking about like, hypersaturated red, big red lights or bathed in red light.
[01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:02.580]  Red flowers, red flowers have always been a great test.
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:03.840]  Right, right.
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:06.280]  And that's because of the nature of CCDs, right?
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:11.540]  They just have have an imbalance of pixels that capture red light.
[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:16.460]  So you end up getting kind of having a problem representing other colors within a flooded
[01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:20.940]  red spectrum, red flowers, bathed in red light, etc.
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:23.520]  However, better this year than most.
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:33.480]  And like the level of detail on the 5x was just in the realm of disbelief for me.
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:38.060]  And it wasn't so much that it was like, I don't think that anything, this could ever
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:41.020]  look any good at the zoom level, because the 3x is pretty good.
[01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:42.020]  Right?
[01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:43.080]  It's not bad.
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:50.500]  But like the the combination of fine detail, image processing, pipeline improvements, and
[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:55.880]  the fact that this prism design, I very, very much expected john, just to be honest, I very
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:18:03.580]  much expected the prism to be really good at making the zoom happen, but bad at overall
[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:04.580]  image quality.
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:11.820]  I expected aberration, I expected some softness, I definitely expected some blooming because
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:12.820]  prisms are hard.
[01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:17.020]  I mean, you're bouncing light from mirror to mirror from pain to pain through these
[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:19.660]  are passing it through them to be more accurate.
[01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:22.820]  And like it's it's hard to keep those aligned.
[01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:27.620]  And then to correct the normal optical flaws that happen anytime you pass through anything
[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:29.860]  right in any medium.
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:33.620]  And Apple does a lot with their lenses already, right, because you can see it if you take
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:36.740]  a raw image and then look at the process when you're like, oh, wow, they're fixing a lot
[01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:37.980]  of this stuff, right.
[01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:45.940]  And so I fully expected that prism to deliver okay results, and for the sake of more zoom,
[01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:51.400]  but instead, what they delivered is like a really viable photography tool.
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.580]  This isn't just a zoom, right?
[01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:56.740]  It's like a tool, a whole photography tool that opened up.
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:58.700]  And I think people are going to really love it.
[01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:03.300]  And I've already seen it like you as people started getting their, their phones delivered.
[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:07.120]  A lot of photographers that I follow and love, they're like, Oh, my God, like, I love this
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:08.120]  thing.
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:09.120]  That's really good.
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:14.100]  And and then the two aspects of stabilization is one, if you're shooting still photos with
[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:21.500]  a long lens, and like a maximum aperture of only f only f 2.8 Getting a sharp image is
[01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:22.500]  very difficult.
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:28.200]  The end this camera absolutely succeeds just point shoot and you get sharp images.
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:31.220]  You don't have to realize how much technical work is going.
[01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:33.380]  But then the other thing is video.
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:34.540]  And right.
[01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:37.340]  I don't think from what I shot.
[01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:45.240]  I don't think you can shoot five x video while you are walking.
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:51.780]  But if you stand still, you capture great video, including of people in motion, and
[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:56.420]  you can move, you can move a little, you just can't sort of like, chase somebody down the
[01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:58.140]  street or walk after somebody.
[01:19:58.140 --> 01:19:59.380]  It's too much.
[01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:04.900]  It's just it's not, it's not a pro, right in the 3d, which 3d, by the way, means that
[01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:10.500]  lateral movement forward and back now has at least some stabilization added to it.
[01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:14.700]  But there's not enough throw inside there, it would have to be like a camera, the camera
[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:17.540]  chamber would have to be like five inches across, right.
[01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:21.180]  But what you can do definitely, and I did it like when I was shooting the skateboarders
[01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:25.860]  is you can pan with five x video.
[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:29.860]  That sounds like well, of course, you should be able to pan and get a smooth image that
[01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:33.660]  isn't making people feel like it's jittery, like you're riding on a roller coaster or
[01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:38.380]  something, but that that's, that just wasn't possible before with a video camera.
[01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:44.260]  If you took a camera and zoom to an equivalent of 120 millimeters and panned by hand without
[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:48.900]  having it on the tripod, it would look yeah, it would it would just be all jitter.
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:56.020]  It is remarkable how easy they make it look to shoot five x video of somebody, some subject
[01:20:56.020 --> 01:21:00.780]  to your kid running from second to third base, and you're just panning across and you get
[01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:03.100]  a smooth video.
[01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:04.220]  It is.
[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:06.540]  It's really, really just smooth.
[01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:08.620]  It's like unbelievably good.
[01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:11.460]  Like it's really, really, so really smooth.
[01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:16.700]  I had a I think I've included in some of my video review component in my video review,
[01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:23.900]  but I had an out of body experience, to be honest, shooting some video on Casey Junior's
[01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:24.980]  train ride, right.
[01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:33.080]  So Casey Junior train ride at Disneyland is it set to circle it circles around the story
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:37.740]  book land canal boats, and the storybook land canal boats for those who've never done it,
[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:42.000]  you just sit on this little boat and you and you kind of ride in this river around these
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:48.980]  miniature scenes that are built like in miniature of like Arendelle, the castle from Frozen,
[01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:54.760]  the castle from Aladdin, various scenes, pastoral scenes from these these movies.
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:58.120]  And the train is sort of elevated above that and kind of goes around it.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:04.660]  And I shot some video of the of the scenes like one shot, especially of the castle there
[01:22:04.660 --> 01:22:05.860]  in the castle.
[01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:10.340]  And this is like kind of like a rattly movie train, you know, it's kind of clicking, clacking
[01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:14.040]  and going up and forth and jerking me back and forth.
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:18.580]  And I just shot some video handheld over my shoulder of the castle and sort of tried to
[01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:20.840]  keep it in frame as we moved.
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:22.980]  It looks like a drone shot.
[01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:25.620]  I mean, it's so smooth.
[01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:32.300]  It looks like somebody was shooting a $10,000 stabilized drone of a full size castle, right
[01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:34.740]  from like a mile away or whatever.
[01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:39.060]  I know obviously some of its perspective, but it was so cool.
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:40.060]  I know that.
[01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:41.060]  Wow.
[01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:44.540]  I know the shot you're talking about because I saw it and I was like, this is just it doesn't
[01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:45.540]  seem possible.
[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:46.540]  It really doesn't.
[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:51.960]  It's so and it just is point and shoot, but it's and in video in particular, it is so
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:57.200]  super useful to people to be able to shoot at a long distance like that because you can
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:58.560]  crop video.
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:02.980]  But how many consumers do you know who even know where to go to crop video?
[01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:03.980]  You don't.
[01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:04.980]  That's it.
[01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:08.420]  And cropping video is so much harder processing intensive wise, et cetera.
[01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:10.260]  You need a beefy machine to do that and all that.
[01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:11.260]  It's so much harder.
[01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:12.260]  Right.
[01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:16.780]  People just don't like what what people capture in the frame in their videos is what they're
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:20.420]  going to keep for the rest of their lives and their photo library.
[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:27.700]  And so being able to shoot useful, smooth, zoomed in video like that of anything that
[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:36.540]  you would want that sort of throw to capture in frame is honestly, I it's like there's
[01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:38.980]  a part of the life changing thing.
[01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:42.800]  And I think when people hear life changing, they think like, oh, yeah, cured somebody
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:48.060]  of a disease or whatever, like life changing can be in there are different grades of life
[01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:49.060]  changing.
[01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:50.060]  Right.
[01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:53.720]  And if you look at like the traditional video.
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:59.880]  So I used to this way back in the day, I used to do VHS transfers and 16 millimeter transfers
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:03.780]  of video and film to DVD at the time.
[01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:04.780]  Right.
[01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:06.820]  So you would take these tapes that people brought in.
[01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:11.620]  My grandpa had all these reels of 60 millimeter or my dad had all of these VHS tapes that
[01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:13.060]  he took of us.
[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:18.140]  And we don't have VHS player or or ours broke and we want to watch them on DVD.
[01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:22.380]  And so you would digitize them and transfer them through a box to a DVD and burn them
[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:23.860]  onto a DVD.
[01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:30.100]  And I can tell you, I have viewed thousands of thousands of hours of zoomed in shaky as
[01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:31.740]  hell video, right?
[01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:37.660]  Like, like, oh, the kids on stage, I'm shooting from the back of the auditorium because I
[01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:40.300]  don't want to block anybody's view or whatever.
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:42.780]  And it's like this rattly shaky video.
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:43.780]  Right.
[01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:46.660]  And when you did those transfers, you probably had to watch them the whole time, right?
[01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:48.060]  Because it's sort of like, oh, yeah, I did.
[01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:49.060]  I've seen.
[01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:50.060]  Right.
[01:24:50.060 --> 01:24:51.060]  The things my eyes have seen, John.
[01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:55.180]  Let's just say not everybody's VHS tapes are family vacations.
[01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:59.500]  Let me just put it that way.
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:02.580]  But yes, I did have to watch them all and I saw a lot of it, right?
[01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:03.580]  I saw a lot.
[01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:04.580]  I actually really cool.
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:09.340]  I kind of got to see tons of 60 millimeter video of Disneyland in the 50s and 60s and
[01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:10.340]  all that stuff.
[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:13.280]  But whatever the zooms were, they were largely useless.
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:18.980]  It was fun that they existed and it's like, oh, look at Uncle John is making a face on
[01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:20.420]  the ride or on the balcony.
[01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:22.980]  And we've zoomed in on him and there he is dancing.
[01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:24.060]  But you can't see his face.
[01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:25.060]  Really.
[01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:26.060]  It's all blurry.
[01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:27.060]  It's shaky as hell.
[01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:32.580]  And like this is like, hey, for the first time ever, that zoomed picture where you would
[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:36.500]  normally digitally zoom or hope as much as possible that you were capturing at least
[01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:42.020]  something that was a memory is now a viable, crisp image.
[01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:43.460]  And I think that's great.
[01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:46.420]  That's a wonderful thing to have.
[01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:49.660]  One of the little features, I didn't mention it in my review, hope to put it in a follow
[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:50.660]  up.
[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:51.660]  But did you notice this?
[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:56.460]  Like if you do digitally zoom and now this was for both pro cameras this year, 15 pro
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:57.620]  and a pro max.
[01:25:57.620 --> 01:26:06.060]  So on the three X and the five X, if you zoom past 8.0 which is digital zoom even on that
[01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:07.060]  five X.
[01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:12.220]  But with the five X, you could get to eight and still have reasonable image quality.
[01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:17.140]  You get a mini map up in the corner showing you the full frame.
[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:21.780]  And because it's hard to explain, like did you, did you notice the feature?
[01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:22.780]  It did.
[01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:23.780]  Yeah.
[01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:24.780]  Yeah.
[01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:28.760]  I did use it somewhat because I had noticed it in a, in one of their feature.
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:34.220]  Like I scroll quickly, scroll the, the, the feature set page on apple.com.
[01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:36.420]  They're like, Hey, here's all the cool new features, whatever.
[01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:38.140]  And I had noticed it in there somewhere.
[01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:39.140]  And so I wanted to try it out.
[01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:42.500]  So I tried it out a couple of times and it basically gives you a video guy.
[01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:43.860]  I think mini map is the right word.
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:47.800]  Like it gives you a video game mini map of your whole frame.
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:52.540]  And I I'm guessing it takes it like if I had to guess it would be like at the one X level
[01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:55.660]  or maybe two X level, depending on how much you've zoomed.
[01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:57.900]  And it gives you that map of the corner.
[01:26:57.900 --> 01:27:03.420]  So it presents a small picture in picture in the corner with a yellow box that shows
[01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:07.440]  you your current frame, like in the larger and the larger window.
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:13.300]  And so you're able to zoom way out to 25 X and then still move around inside that frame
[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:16.880]  with some idea of where you're headed because previously it's like turning on a light switch
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:20.860]  with a broomstick, but you're like trying to like find the thing and where, where is
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:21.860]  this?
[01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:24.900]  So it gives you a map of where you're headed to shoot the thing you want to shoot.
[01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:25.900]  Right?
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:26.900]  Exactly.
[01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:28.360]  I'll just keep going back to my little league perspective.
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:34.180]  And it's like, you're looking to zoom in optically on a kid wearing a batting helmet
[01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:37.860]  and, but you're zoomed in at like 10 or 15 X or something.
[01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:40.700]  And you see a tree and you're like, where's, I didn't even know there was a tree.
[01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:41.860]  What, where the hell am I?
[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:42.860]  You know what I mean?
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:47.340]  And you just start waving, you just start, you just start waving the phone around in
[01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:49.540]  front of your eyes to sort of get it.
[01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:51.780]  And it's like the mini map is a super cool feature.
[01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:56.740]  I think that the full frame of the mini map is just the full frame of the three X or five
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:01.380]  X camera though, which, which I think, cause I think the one X would be too, it would be
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:03.780]  too big of a mini map too big of a map.
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:04.780]  I think you're right.
[01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:05.780]  Yeah.
[01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:06.780]  I didn't figure it out.
[01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:07.780]  Exactly.
[01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:08.780]  But yeah, but it's a, it's a very cool feature.
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:14.220]  I, I don't know an Apple, even off of the record, never, ever, ever explained stuff
[01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:20.020]  like this, but it's like, that's only in these 15 pros.
[01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:26.340]  Is it really an image pipeline feature that's enabling the, that, or could they in theory
[01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:31.180]  have back ported it to like the 14 pro when it upgrades to iOS 17?
[01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:33.700]  I don't know, but you don't get it with a 14 pro.
[01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:38.940]  I mean, it may be an image processing kind of overhead thing, but yeah, sometimes it's
[01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:42.100]  like these features come to these cameras and they're like, Hey, we consider this to
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:44.340]  be a part of the camera that you're using.
[01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:45.340]  They leave it at that.
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:49.660]  And you could, yeah, as you said, even the people we've asked are always like, ah, cause
[01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:54.000]  you have to find the specific person who's like in the performance team who handles these
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.140]  things that says like, Oh yeah, this couldn't support it or well, and they'll never say
[01:28:57.140 --> 01:28:58.140]  really.
[01:28:58.140 --> 01:28:59.140]  So it's hard to say.
[01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:00.140]  All right.
[01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:05.620]  Moving on from the camera, the big change I put at first was the switch to titanium.
[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:08.340]  I could not be happier about this.
[01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:10.580]  I just, I love the way it feels.
[01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:17.520]  I much prefer the way it looks and the weight reduction is just phenomenal.
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:23.900]  So Eve, the weight reduction is so, so significant and so meaningful to me that even if I didn't
[01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:29.780]  like the way it looked, I would still give it a thumbs up as the change.
[01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:33.340]  Like I knew they weren't going to do it, but it's like, damn it.
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:37.260]  I've wished for years that they, you know, I understand why they didn't.
[01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:43.340]  I would have rather had all of the iPhone pros of the last few years with aluminum frames
[01:29:43.340 --> 01:29:48.140]  than stainless steel for the weight reduction, even if it meant they looked plain because
[01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:53.860]  aluminum is not a fancy looking finish, but, but I do like the way titanium looks, I love
[01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:56.580]  the weight reduction and I think it feels great.
[01:29:56.580 --> 01:30:00.140]  And I also, I think this fingerprint thing is a non-issue.
[01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:04.700]  Yes, it, you can see fingerprints when your hands are greasy, but it wipes out.
[01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:09.240]  It's like whatever this PVD coating they're using on a titanium, it's clearly has some
[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:11.780]  kind of oleophobic quality to it.
[01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:16.060]  The fingerprints clean right off just putting it in your, your pants pocket.
[01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:18.620]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:20.020]  Most people are gonna put a damn case on anyway.
[01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:23.380]  I always, I know different people because it's like, look, dude, congratulations that
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:27.700]  you run it without a case, but the vast majority of people are not going to do that.
[01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:30.700]  But yeah, I mean the natural titanium doesn't really fingerprint that much.
[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:34.700]  So I guess if you're really obsessed, you're going to get the normal oil smudges on it,
[01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:38.300]  but it doesn't really show it in high relief, but the other coatings tend to show it better.
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:44.560]  I don't, I don't really care that much about, I really can't bring myself to care that much
[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:48.860]  about it because yeah, like fingers have oil on them and frankly everybody's fingers have
[01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:50.340]  a different amount of oil on them, right?
[01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:55.380]  So yeah, stuff fingerprints, like what are, who cares?
[01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:56.860]  Do you appreciate the weight difference?
[01:30:56.860 --> 01:31:00.740]  I mean, it seems like everybody, yeah, the weight difference thing I think is, it absolutely
[01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:01.740]  is legit.
[01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:07.620]  I mean, I know you and I both read that post by Dr. Drang where he attributes some of the,
[01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:10.300]  the feel of the weight to distribution, right?
[01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:14.340]  Because look here, the pivot point of the weight is lower.
[01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:19.460]  The internal frame is aluminum and the external frame is titanium, both lighter weight materials
[01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:20.600]  than steel.
[01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:24.220]  I think all of that is obviously taken into account.
[01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:30.280]  It's not that much on the raw, like weight reduction front in terms of grams, but it
[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:35.020]  feels a lot, a lot better to hold the, the larger phones in the past.
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:39.740]  It was such a hard choice to go with the larger phone because the more zoom because it was
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:44.060]  so heavy and so hard to do a one handed operation with, but I've been loving it.
[01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:51.340]  I think it is definitely materially in a way that you can feel lighter and easier to hold.
[01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:52.340]  Yeah.
[01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:56.660]  And I mentioned it in my review and I think it's, it's one of my favorite parts of it.
[01:31:56.660 --> 01:32:00.380]  I tend to use my phone without a case or the overwhelming amount of time.
[01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:05.400]  I get it though, 90% of people, although not 90% of my readers, I did a poll on Twitter
[01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:10.060]  and it was like a surprising number of my readers are like us and go caseless, but I
[01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:12.220]  guess that's why they read Daring Firewall.
[01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:16.980]  They appreciate nice things and are willing to gamble on the drop ability.
[01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:21.540]  But the best part about this titanium weight reduction is for the overwhelming majority
[01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:24.580]  of people who we all know are going to put their new phone in a case and not take it
[01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:28.920]  out until they resell it and trade it in, they get the weight reduction.
[01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:34.140]  So it's a fantastic benefit even for people who aren't going to see or touch the titanium
[01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:37.380]  because they have their phone in a case, they get a lighter phone.
[01:32:37.380 --> 01:32:38.380]  I love it.
[01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:39.380]  I can't wait.
[01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:41.020]  I'm so glad that they're done with steel.
[01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:42.340]  I can't see any reason to go back.
[01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:47.400]  I will say this though, since we're recording after the phones have shipped to people, I've
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:53.780]  had two friends so far who both profess that they don't like the way it looks and feel
[01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:57.540]  that it doesn't look anywhere near as premium.
[01:32:57.540 --> 01:33:03.660]  Two people who both loved the polished mirrored finish of stainless steel and feel that the
[01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:09.680]  more industrial look of titanium is a downgrade visually.
[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:12.500]  So it's like, and I was like, ah, interesting.
[01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:17.260]  Two people in one day who got their phones on day one, both said the same thing to me
[01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:20.500]  and I thought, huh, that's why Apple is with shipping polished stainless steel.
[01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:23.060]  Yeah, I honestly, yeah, it's exactly that.
[01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:28.620]  I think that the jewel like nature of the polished steel sort of telegraph that you
[01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:31.020]  had a higher grade device.
[01:33:31.020 --> 01:33:37.000]  Ironically, I think that titanium feels more pro, you know, pro devices historically have
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:42.740]  been brushed steel powder-coated treated surfaces, right, because they're meant to be durable
[01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:47.140]  and industrial, not, you know, beautiful and jewel like, right?
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:54.580]  So the pro phones of the past, in my opinion, the ID ran much more towards the premium end
[01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:58.060]  of the spectrum than the pro end of the spectrum, right?
[01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:03.660]  So both higher grade, both you could telegraph this idea of something more, something higher,
[01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:06.100]  something better, something worth more.
[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:09.380]  But premium is a significantly different vibe.
[01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:14.180]  Premium slash luxury, right, is a significantly different vibe than pro.
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:19.300]  Titanium feels more pro to me, but far less premium or luxury, even though the materials
[01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:22.460]  are harder to work with, and maybe even more expensive, etc.
[01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:25.820]  The look and feel of it feels more pro than premium.
[01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:27.540]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:28.540]  I like it.
[01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:31.260]  I don't know what else they have up their sleeve for the future.
[01:34:31.260 --> 01:34:36.220]  These are obviously the first titanium phones Apple has made, but they've been playing with
[01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:41.140]  titanium for years with Apple Watch, including my, I don't have it on my wrist right now,
[01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:47.700]  I'm wearing a review unit, but my series seven black titanium, I forget if they called it
[01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:52.060]  black or graphite or whatever, but I don't know how close how much more mirrored they
[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:53.880]  could get it if they wanted to.
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:58.140]  I think the white one, which I haven't seen in person since the event, but because the
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:00.740]  I think I have the same color review units as you.
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:04.420]  I have a natural titanium pro max and a blue pro.
[01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:05.420]  Yeah.
[01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:06.420]  Yeah.
[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:07.820]  Those are the ones I ended up with.
[01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:08.820]  Yeah.
[01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:13.460]  And I have, I got my black pro personal one that I bought yesterday, so I've seen that
[01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:14.460]  one again.
[01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:19.380]  I have, as I recall from the hands on area that the white one is shiniest.
[01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:20.380]  That's sort of the difference.
[01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:23.220]  Like what's the brighter color of titanium?
[01:35:23.220 --> 01:35:24.220]  Yeah.
[01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:27.900]  But it's still curious to me because the back of that phone, they call it white, but it's
[01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:28.900]  not white.
[01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:30.380]  It's sort of off white.
[01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:32.020]  That's, that's the curious thing to me.
[01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:37.500]  I can see why they went with both natural and white and the natural, especially since
[01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:45.380]  they're just making the fact that it's titanium, the first marketing campaign, there's a billboard
[01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:46.740]  around the corner from me.
[01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:52.180]  And the only word on the billboard is titanium iPhone 15 pro the commercials I'm seeing on
[01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:57.900]  football games are all about titanium and titanium, titanium, titanium.
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:58.900]  I don't blame them.
[01:35:58.900 --> 01:35:59.940]  I think it's great.
[01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:04.780]  And also it, no other phone maker out there is making phones out of titanium yet if they
[01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:05.780]  ever will again.
[01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:06.780]  Yeah.
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:11.980]  I mean the titanium thing is so interesting to me because titanium as a material retains
[01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:15.660]  a lot more heat than aluminum, which is, you know, why they did this.
[01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:21.820]  They came up with this whole interesting like bonding process where they keep the interior
[01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:26.300]  frame of the phone aluminum so that it wicks heat quickly, transfers heat away from the
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:30.460]  CPU, GPU, et cetera, and out towards the edges of the phone.
[01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:35.380]  But I'm sure you've noticed the phone is significantly hotter than the 14 pro.
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:37.860]  In my opinion, I haven't run thermal tests.
[01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:41.740]  I think some folks, some reviewers have and noticed that it ran significantly hotter,
[01:36:41.740 --> 01:36:44.280]  especially when charging or like gaming.
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:46.420]  I don't think it's a factor.
[01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:51.560]  I think it's probably going to be one of those things that becomes a mini meme for reviewers
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:57.840]  over the next few weeks because for the long tail of reviewers, because it's hot, man.
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:01.840]  Like it does get hot to the touch, not in a way that I ever found to be uncomfortable
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:03.860]  or anything like that.
[01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:06.300]  But my wife had even noticed, she's like, Oh wow, this is warmer.
[01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:08.120]  Like this feels quite a bit warmer.
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:11.380]  And I think that's the titanium has a lot to do with that.
[01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:13.680]  It holds heat more than aluminum.
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:18.340]  If it's wicking heat away from the GPU, it's going to hit that titanium material and stay
[01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:21.100]  longer and like chill out there more.
[01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:26.000]  So the rim is going to be hotter when you're either gaming hardcore or charging it with
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.940]  a fast charger with a high wattage charger.
[01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:33.740]  But the fact is it's like, once again, almost a non issue for me, as long as it doesn't
[01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:37.860]  affect overall performance, which that's a factor, but it's not a really a factor for
[01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:39.680]  me because everybody runs cases.
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:41.680]  So who cares?
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:43.080]  That's that's the way I look at it.
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:48.380]  One question I asked and I was, wasn't expecting an answer, but it's, I effectively got the
[01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:53.080]  answer was, cause it, when I pose this, you'll see, Oh yeah, that seems like the type of
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:57.780]  question they wouldn't comment on, but I sort of got an answer, which was with this aluminum
[01:37:57.780 --> 01:38:03.500]  interior titanium exterior, was it a cost thing because titanium is expensive and it's
[01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:07.420]  cheaper to use aluminum where you can inside where it's not exposed or was it really an
[01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:08.900]  engineering thing and a heat thing.
[01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:10.500]  And they're like, it's an engineering thing.
[01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:16.200]  Like it was a, like the idea of using titanium in all the parts where there's actually aluminum
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:22.100]  inside wasn't feasible engineering wise, like it wasn't about cost or structure or anything.
[01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:27.840]  It's the heat dissipation issue was the singular reason for it has nothing to do with the weight.
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:31.840]  It's nice that some of it's aluminum because that makes it even lighter than it would be
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:37.060]  if it was more, more titanium, but it's, it's the heat dissipation thing.
[01:38:37.060 --> 01:38:40.260]  And again, a lot of times they don't want to talk about engineering problems like that,
[01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:43.660]  but they kind of talked about it in the keynote, which, which I guess is why they were willing
[01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:49.460]  to reiterate it to me off the record that it was, it's a heat problem and a long, long
[01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:51.660]  standing problem that they were trying to solve.
[01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:54.160]  Oh, I have heath, heath.
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:55.160]  That's what it was.
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:57.380]  It's totally just jumped in my head, H-E-I-F.
[01:38:57.380 --> 01:38:58.380]  Yeah.
[01:38:58.380 --> 01:38:59.380]  That's that.
[01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:00.380]  Isn't that the video format?
[01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:01.380]  Right?
[01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:02.380]  Yeah.
[01:39:02.380 --> 01:39:03.380]  Yeah.
[01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:04.380]  That was, but that's how they pronounced it.
[01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:08.220]  I don't think I, they pronounced it heat for the, for the images, but we were talking
[01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:09.220]  about video.
[01:39:09.220 --> 01:39:10.220]  Right.
[01:39:10.220 --> 01:39:11.220]  So yeah.
[01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:12.220]  Heath.
[01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:13.220]  I remember now I was like, they said heath.
[01:39:13.220 --> 01:39:14.220]  I'm sorry.
[01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:15.220]  What?
[01:39:15.220 --> 01:39:16.220]  Yeah.
[01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:17.220]  Like I was like, is that a, I thought it was like a person's name.
[01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:19.220]  Like Keith, Keith, Keith Richards.
[01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:20.220]  Who's he?
[01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:21.220]  Who's he?
[01:39:21.220 --> 01:39:22.220]  Yeah.
[01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:23.220]  That's right.
[01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:24.220]  The call back, but it just jumped in my head.
[01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:25.220]  Yes.
[01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:26.220]  You are right though.
[01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:27.220]  It was heath.
[01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:32.940]  I don't know who he is, but let me see here.
[01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:33.940]  What else?
[01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:36.420]  iPhones pro you gotta, you gotta roll with it.
[01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:37.420]  All right.
[01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:39.580]  I will say this on the battery front, a couple of people commented.
[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:44.140]  I didn't write about battery life in my review and it's something I, I think I'd skip it
[01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:50.820]  most years because I, with only like five days of testing, I don't feel like anything
[01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:55.120]  I can say about the battery life is useful because with five days of testing, I've spent
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:40:01.220]  the entire time using the phones in unnatural ways because I'm shooting way more photos
[01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:04.820]  and videos than I would on any normal day.
[01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:08.240]  And it's impossible even with multiple phones.
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:14.540]  Like I have, they, as my reviewer kit bag had all four phones, 15, 15 plus 15 pro 15
[01:40:14.540 --> 01:40:15.860]  pro max.
[01:40:15.860 --> 01:40:23.420]  I can't pretend to use one of them quote unquote normally while using another one to stress
[01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:25.020]  test the camera.
[01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:30.660]  Because number one, I can only have my SIM card in one or my SIM eSIM active in one.
[01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:35.320]  And it's like, well, I am getting notifications on that phone and I'm doing things on it.
[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:39.740]  I can't say that this other phone is being used normally, so I can't make judgments.
[01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:45.460]  All I can do is comment on the battery life I got while stress testing the phones, which
[01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:50.220]  was in line with previous years of iPhones, like got me through the day.
[01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:51.220]  Yes.
[01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:57.840]  My battery was way lower than it is with my 14 pro on a normal day by five o'clock because
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:01.780]  I've been shooting video and using the screens been on all time.
[01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:06.500]  Like I can look at my, what do you, what do they call it, screen time stats.
[01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:10.940]  It's like my screen times stats look like I caught a case of iPhone addiction a week
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:11.940]  ago.
[01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:12.940]  Right.
[01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:13.940]  Exactly.
[01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:14.940]  Yeah.
[01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:19.780]  Your screen time is up 92% was I think my notification, right?
[01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:22.460]  So I just, it's not worth commenting on battery life.
[01:41:22.460 --> 01:41:23.980]  Not because I don't think it's an important issue.
[01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:24.980]  Of course it is.
[01:41:24.980 --> 01:41:31.140]  I think I would notice if battery life were worse if it were dying by two or three in
[01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:34.980]  the afternoon while stress testing it, I'd be like, well, this is unusual.
[01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:39.620]  I don't remember ever doing this with a review, but the, the reviewer's perspective
[01:41:39.620 --> 01:41:42.900]  in a five day period is just totally unnatural.
[01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:48.500]  You know, you obviously take going to Disneyland, even when you're not reviewing a phone is
[01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:51.980]  an unusual situation.
[01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:55.660]  It's a repeatable aggressive scenario, right?
[01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:59.100]  Like that's the, that's one of the reasons I love the Disneyland thing is I agree with
[01:41:59.100 --> 01:42:01.500]  you, like, look, there's a bunch of factors with battery life.
[01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:07.260]  That's why I don't like put precise times or like do battery comparison charts for my
[01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:11.900]  particular review, not, and nothing against the people that run like a video test and
[01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:17.780]  just verify because you should trust, but verify any stats that a company gives you
[01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:19.740]  about how their device performs.
[01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:22.700]  Apple tends to be pretty careful about their tests.
[01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:26.800]  So if you run a rough test, that's very similar to what they put on the website.
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:31.460]  You should get something in that range and I think reviewers have gotten that, but I,
[01:42:31.460 --> 01:42:36.900]  I tried like, yes, if, even if it was a phone I'd had for six months and I went to Disneyland
[01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:41.040]  with it, that thing is going to get the absolute junk used out of it during that day.
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:42.900]  And there's reviewing a phone is no exception.
[01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:45.220]  And in fact, it's like, it's exacerbated.
[01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:49.380]  So I give people a rough idea of like, Hey, I charged, I took it off the charger at like
[01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:54.080]  seven 30 AM and I had to charge it by about five 30 PM or whatever it was.
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:56.920]  And I take, what I normally do is just take a screenshot in the morning and then I take
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:00.340]  a screenshot at 1%, like when my battery's about to go dead and I'm going to plug in
[01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:05.180]  a portable charger or plug it in and then just give people that rough idea so that they
[01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:10.300]  can see like, Hey, if you're using your phone, like mad at Disneyland, this is the rough
[01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:11.560]  thing you're going to get.
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:15.260]  But there's additional factors, which I try to mention stuff, which is that these are
[01:43:15.260 --> 01:43:19.040]  brand new devices that are still indexing, right?
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:21.260]  Like I can't index fast enough, right?
[01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:22.780]  I can't let them sit for three days.
[01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:27.860]  No, I have to start using my cloud and yeah, index them and like all of that stuff.
[01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:28.940]  And you got to start using them.
[01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:30.320]  So there's mitigating factors.
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:35.220]  So I actually feel okay with that when I talk about battery life in my review, which is
[01:43:35.220 --> 01:43:39.740]  that rough idea number that I just said, because in my mind, that's conservative, they'll probably
[01:43:39.740 --> 01:43:41.080]  get more, right?
[01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:42.420]  Like they will probably get more than that.
[01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:44.260]  I'm fine being conservative.
[01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:46.300]  I don't want to be overly optimistic.
[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:47.300]  Yeah.
[01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:48.300]  All right.
[01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:52.180]  Let me take a break here and thank our third and final sponsor of the day fuel for my end
[01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:58.460]  of this podcast, trade coffee, trade coffee connects people to the best roasters in the
[01:43:58.460 --> 01:44:07.220]  country so that you can discover great coffee to brew at home with 450 over 450 coffees,
[01:44:07.220 --> 01:44:13.140]  everything from dark roasts, espresso blends, rare roasts, you name it.
[01:44:13.140 --> 01:44:16.780]  Trade guarantees that you will find something new to love.
[01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:22.380]  If you're not sure where to start with craft coffee, they guide you through the process
[01:44:22.380 --> 01:44:26.500]  at the beginning, ask you some questions about the sort of things you like and they get you
[01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:27.500]  started.
[01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:30.820]  And then when you get your coffee, it's a subscription service gets delivered to your
[01:44:30.820 --> 01:44:31.820]  home.
[01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:36.860]  When you start getting your coffee, you then answered, did you like it?
[01:44:36.860 --> 01:44:37.860]  Give it a thumbs up.
[01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:39.400]  Was this not really to your liking?
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:40.400]  Give it a thumbs down.
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:43.260]  And they use those like sort of, Hey, I like this one.
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:45.200]  Oh, I didn't like that one.
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:48.940]  And sort of tailor what they deliver to you in the future.
[01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:52.840]  I've been subscribed to trade coffee for like well over a year at this point.
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:54.540]  I don't give them any feedback anymore.
[01:44:54.540 --> 01:44:58.980]  I just take the coffee they shipped to me and it's just delicious week after week after
[01:44:58.980 --> 01:44:59.980]  week.
[01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:01.960]  You get to set the schedule you want.
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:04.720]  You want like one bag of coffee every two weeks.
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:07.980]  That's what I'm on because I'm the only coffee drinker in the house.
[01:45:07.980 --> 01:45:09.240]  You want one every week.
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:11.600]  You want one every three weeks, something like that.
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:17.280]  You just get to set it a super easy webpage where you log in, you're going on vacation.
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:21.080]  You can just pause your delivery for a while, set a thing like that.
[01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:23.380]  You have complete control over that stuff.
[01:45:23.380 --> 01:45:30.040]  But the main thing is it is great coffee from dozens, dozens of independent roasters all
[01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:34.260]  over America delivered fresh to your home.
[01:45:34.260 --> 01:45:39.260]  It's always delivered shipped within 48 hours of being roasted within 48 hours of being
[01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:40.260]  roasted.
[01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:41.260]  It's in the bag.
[01:45:41.260 --> 01:45:42.260]  It's in the box.
[01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:43.260]  It's mailed to you.
[01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:48.280]  You get it within days of being roasted and it is just, it's just terrific coffee and
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:49.280]  you don't have to do anything.
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:50.280]  It's just magic.
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:51.280]  Ding dong.
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:54.520]  The post office comes and delivers fresh coffee to you on a regular basis.
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:56.320]  It couldn't be better.
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:59.000]  Upgrade your morning routine with better coffee right now.
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:03.080]  Trade is offering listeners of the talk show a free bag of coffee with any subscription.
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:08.960]  Just go to drink trade.com slash the talk show.
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:15.760]  That's drink trade.com slash the talk show with the, the for a free bag of coffee with
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:17.680]  any subscription purchase.
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:22.120]  Drink trade.com slash the talk show.
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:23.920]  I what else is there?
[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:25.720]  USB-C. I don't have much to say about it.
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:26.720]  I'm glad.
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:28.120]  It seems like there's not much controversy.
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:31.160]  Seems like it's just sort of, yeah, okay, new adapter.
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:35.320]  I think the main point you mentioned it in your review, it's certainly because me and
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:37.600]  my wife is the only ones here and we both bought new phones.
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:41.440]  It won't be a problem for us, but the main problem people are going to run into is like,
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:47.200]  Oh, I mean, who doesn't have like a, a charging cable in the kitchen or something like that?
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:52.640]  Well, now you need to, if you're, unless every single member of your household is upgraded
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:56.980]  to the new phones this year and anybody out there with kids and stuff like that, now you've
[01:46:56.980 --> 01:47:02.560]  got to have two cables or if you've got like a charging cable in your car, I don't know.
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:05.040]  Then you're going to want that, right?
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:10.780]  Is this a reason to put, replace those cables sitting around with mag safe pucks maybe,
[01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:16.960]  but for the, even with mag safe at like an Apple branded one that charges at 15 Watts,
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:22.840]  you can charge close to twice the speed with a cable connection.
[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:28.400]  And those sort of like, Oh, I'm like ready to go out the door to run errands or go to
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:29.400]  work or something.
[01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:30.400]  And my phone needs to charge.
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:34.580]  Like a lot of the times when anything other than charging overnight, you kind of want
[01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:37.140]  it to go as fast as possible.
[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:39.320]  That's a pain, but you know, it is what it is.
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:44.180]  And I guess the downside, the biggest downside is that lightning and USB looks so similar
[01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:50.220]  at a glance that it's, it's easy to absentmindedly try to stab the wrong cable into the bottom
[01:47:50.220 --> 01:48:00.040]  of your phone, which I guess like the multi-cable family was always been a thing.
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:03.880]  I just think that iPhones have been like the constant for the past 10 years, right?
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:06.000]  Like it's always like, Oh, I got to charge in a battery pack.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.200]  Oh, dang, this is an old one.
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:08.640]  It takes micro USB.
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:12.720]  Like my, my charging station in my office, which is, I wish there was something better
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:13.720]  out there.
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:19.160]  Nobody's really made anyone anything that's worth anything, but like the, the idea that
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:23.640]  you know, you're going to have multiple different battery packs and charges and things is not
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:25.060]  foreign to me.
[01:48:25.060 --> 01:48:29.360]  And I think probably to most people, I don't think anybody was like, Oh, we're a one cable
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:32.360]  household and gosh, these iPhones are just outliers.
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:38.640]  I think high, like high range, early adopters maybe have been that way for a bit.
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:42.720]  Cause they're like, have been converting themselves aggressively over to USB-C. But the fact is
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:46.720]  it's like the vast majority of cheap battery packs that are offered on the market or use
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:50.840]  USB like micro USB to charge and have for years.
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:53.520]  And so you have always been like a multifamily household.
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:58.960]  I just think now it's like that association of, Oh, there's a white cable hanging out
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:00.840]  of a charger or a wall.
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:01.840]  That's lightning.
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:05.800]  I'm going to plug this thing into my phone and it's just led to some annoyance so far,
[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:07.600]  but you know, it is what it is.
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:08.600]  Yeah.
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:11.560]  One thing I've done for years personally, although I guess now I don't really need lightning
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:17.020]  in my bag or I guess I'll keep one cause I have a lightning Apple battery pack, but I've
[01:49:17.020 --> 01:49:21.420]  always only used Apple's lightning cables, which are white.
[01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:24.760]  And then when I buy my own USB-C cables, I never buy white.
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:27.840]  I just buy them in black or gray or something like that.
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:31.360]  And so if I see a white cable and if I see a white cable, I know it's lightning.
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:36.760]  And if I see a black cable, I know it's not lightning, probably USB-C or something else,
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:38.080]  but not that big a deal.
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:39.080]  Action button.
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:40.080]  I'm a big fan.
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:41.080]  I've been playing with it.
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:45.680]  I think it's cause if all you want is to mute, I think it's actually better than the old
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:49.020]  mute switch, or at least it's a, it's a wash.
[01:49:49.020 --> 01:49:50.020]  It's not worse.
[01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:54.780]  If all you want is a button above the volume buttons that toggles the silent mode, you've
[01:49:54.780 --> 01:49:56.120]  still got it.
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:50:00.080]  It takes enough of a long press that I don't think it's possible to do it accidentally,
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:03.520]  but it works fast enough where it never feels like, come on, come on, come on.
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:05.440]  I'm pressing this switch.
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:06.440]  It's fast.
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:07.440]  I love the options.
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:09.320]  The shortcut stuff has been fun to play with.
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:12.040]  I've got this shortcut I wrote, which I'm really loving.
[01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:16.600]  It sounds super nerdy, but in practice it's really working well where I kind of want it
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:20.840]  to be like a magic, sometimes do the mute and sometimes just, I just want to jump into
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:22.360]  the camera really quickly.
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:25.560]  And so I've got, I'm using the device orientation.
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:34.920]  So if it's face down, it's mute switch and anything else, it jumps me to the camera.
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:36.680]  And it's, it just works like magic.
[01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:41.880]  So every time I'm looking at it, I just take it out and it'll jump me to the camera.
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:45.360]  And if I really want to just toggle the mute switch, I just make sure it's face down
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:52.200]  or upside down, which is the pocket, like portrait mode upside down, that seemingly
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:56.440]  I, and some people I've, I tweeted that out or posted on during fire when they're like,
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:58.020]  why doesn't it work like that by default?
[01:50:58.020 --> 01:51:00.520]  And I'm like, Oh no, that'd be terrible by default.
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:01.520]  Right?
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:06.320]  Like normal people don't want to, Apple can't ship it like that to 200 million customers
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:07.320]  depend.
[01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:08.320]  Yeah.
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:09.320]  It depends.
[01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:10.320]  Yeah.
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:14.040]  The multi-phage like conditional action thing is not for the faint of heart.
[01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:15.040]  I think.
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:17.320]  Yeah, no, but it's very fun that you can do it.
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:18.320]  Yeah.
[01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:19.320]  That is cool.
[01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:20.320]  It's yeah.
[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:27.160]  I, when I get my phones, I turn the silent switch on and then I never ever turn it off.
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:32.000]  Like I haven't heard my ring tone in like eight years.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  Right?
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000]  Like I don't really care.
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:37.200]  I don't ever, ever, ever have my phone ring ever.
[01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:41.940]  So for me personally, it was like a hundred percent pure unadulterated.
[01:51:41.940 --> 01:51:43.480]  You just gained a button, right?
[01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:45.360]  It was a big plus for me.
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:46.360]  Yeah.
[01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:51.200]  So having it jumped to the camera, I know like I wrote my review, but this was a real
[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:56.840]  eye-opener to me because for years and years now, many, many years, I don't know, over
[01:51:56.840 --> 01:52:01.520]  half of the iPhone's lifetime, they've had a lock screen shortcut to just jump to the
[01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:03.480]  camera from your locked state.
[01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:06.540]  So you don't have to do touch ID back in the day.
[01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:07.880]  You don't have to stab in a code.
[01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:10.400]  You don't have to wait for face ID.
[01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:12.720]  You don't have to slide up, find the camera app.
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:16.640]  You just slide over from the right to the left and you're right in the camera.
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:20.680]  Or there's a little camera button in the lower right corner.
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:25.960]  But having a dedicated button, the biggest use case, you wrote it in your review, where
[01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:27.520]  you don't even have to touch the screen.
[01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:29.720]  And so you don't have to alter your grip, right?
[01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:34.360]  You just hold that button up there in the top left corner and you're already getting
[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:37.980]  it into camera before you're even looking at the face of the phone.
[01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:42.200]  And then the other big win is if you're actually on your phone.
[01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:46.440]  So like you're walking, I'm walking down the sidewalk and I'm like text messaging somebody
[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:50.000]  in messages and it's like, oh, there's something I want to take a photo of.
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.200]  I don't have to go to the home screen and find the photo.
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:53.200]  I have to go to control.
[01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:55.400]  So I just squeeze that button.
[01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:59.460]  And there is, there's a lock screen shortcut to the camera, but there's nothing like that
[01:52:59.460 --> 01:53:01.940]  when you're already in the phone.
[01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:06.900]  And now there is for me all the time with the button and it's like, this is fantastic.
[01:53:06.900 --> 01:53:07.900]  I love it.
[01:53:07.900 --> 01:53:08.900]  Yeah.
[01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:13.120]  And I do like the fact that with the dedicated button, I mean, obviously mine's camera.
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:14.120]  What would it be?
[01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:15.520]  Of course, it's camera for me.
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:20.900]  But with the dedicated button, you can open the camera and take a picture without having
[01:53:20.900 --> 01:53:23.160]  to move any fingers, right?
[01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:26.760]  Because even with the shortcut, even with the swipe, like you're swiping and then you're
[01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:29.760]  finding the shutter button and then you're pressing the shutter button.
[01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:33.200]  And remember sometimes like the shutter button hasn't loaded and so you're like, oh, that
[01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:34.200]  wasn't it.
[01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:35.200]  Oh, let me take another.
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:36.200]  Let me press it again.
[01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:41.960]  But also with the long press of the home screen shortcut, it's still like, oh, that's a long
[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:42.960]  press.
[01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:45.600]  And then you've got to find the shutter, it opens and you've got to find the shutter.
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:49.740]  So like hold, open, click, like your thumb doesn't move.
[01:53:49.740 --> 01:53:52.580]  You have a single point of reference.
[01:53:52.580 --> 01:53:53.600]  You fired it off.
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:55.480]  It absolutely is faster.
[01:53:55.480 --> 01:53:59.500]  It's amazing for kids because they're always doing something and you're like, oh, if only
[01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:01.760]  I had my camera out or if only I was ready.
[01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:06.200]  And over time, if you use your camera, your phone camera a lot, you have this sort of
[01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:10.000]  mental math where you know, like, oh, there's no way I'll be able to get it out in time,
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  right?
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:14.480]  There's no way I'll be able to get to the camera and open it and take a picture.
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:19.200]  And I'm nimble and very familiar with iPhone cameras.
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:23.120]  And the average person is probably just less so because they just haven't used it as long
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:24.120]  or whatever.
[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:29.600]  It's like the average person using a phone camera is not some sort of screen gymnast,
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:30.600]  right?
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:31.600]  They're just trying to like take a picture.
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:32.960]  It takes them significantly longer.
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:35.880]  And I think this is going to be an enormous win for them.
[01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:40.400]  For me, it may be a couple of seconds, like maybe a second and a half, two seconds of
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:44.560]  additional like, okay, cool, I've got the time to capture this picture.
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:48.120]  But I think for a lot of people, it'll be a significant shortcut.
[01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:49.120]  You know?
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:50.120]  Yeah.
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:52.280]  It also I've instantly gotten addicted to it.
[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:57.760]  And now when I go back to my 14 Pro or when I'm testing these new 15 non pro phones, I
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:54:59.320]  can't believe that it's not there.
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:02.320]  I'm like, what's this, what's the switch up here in the corner?
[01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:03.880]  I don't know what this is.
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:10.880]  It feels a little a little marketing spiteful that the only the pros got this button, right?
[01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:12.000]  Like it's not silica.
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.280]  It's not like advanced Apple silicon that enables a button.
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:20.800]  Like they could have they could have put this button on all the iPhone 15 like they could
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:21.800]  have.
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:25.400]  Yeah, it's a little bit of a Yeah, you get these nice features a year early.
[01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:30.640]  Like, I'll eat my hat if this button isn't there on the 16 that aren't pro next year.
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:32.440]  It's a really nice thing this year.
[01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:35.240]  No, it's this button can only be enabled by titanium.
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:36.240]  Yes.
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:37.240]  Yes.
[01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:38.240]  The button only works.
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:42.160]  If you put it on a non titanium phone, it snaps the phone in half.
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:48.600]  A big, big, big part of the keynote and it's manifested itself in Apple dropping all of
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:54.800]  its all of its leather products is the environmental aspect of everything Apple does and you in
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:59.400]  particular played a part in Apple get spreading the message they want to spread you at Lisa
[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:02.760]  Jackson on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt this week.
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:03.760]  Yes.
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:04.760]  Yeah.
[01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:06.040]  Good conversation.
[01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:07.040]  How did that go?
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:09.000]  I had her on the podcast years ago.
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.980]  She's a she's just delightful.
[01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:12.600]  Like off camera offstage.
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:13.600]  Right.
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:14.600]  remarkably.
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:15.600]  Yeah.
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:18.280]  What you see is what you get there and and I think it was Yeah, it's great.
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:20.020]  It was nice for her to come by.
[01:56:20.020 --> 01:56:21.020]  It was fun to talk.
[01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:28.160]  We had, I had interviewed her in 2017, I believe, also had to disrupt and they were sort of
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:33.920]  just a couple of years into her, like, or to developing their plan and kind of announcing
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:38.240]  to the world and getting more robust about reporting, because previously they had some
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:43.240]  pretty lightweight environmental reports on the website that at that stage before Lisa
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:49.360]  joined were largely reactionary, like people were kind of like, on them about some component
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:51.560]  of their environmental footprint.
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:54.440]  And they were like, Okay, well, we'll publish this thing on our website that kind of like
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:59.400]  outlined some of the work we're doing or some of the things that we do, and give some transparency.
[01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:01.920]  And kudos to them for offering any transparency at all.
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:05.180]  That's great, because a lot of companies just don't say anything about it.
[01:57:05.180 --> 01:57:12.760]  But they really didn't have a cohesive, coherent message about Apple, who is ostensibly a company
[01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:19.200]  that talks a lot about social responsibility towards reducing their footprint in some material
[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:21.120]  way over the next decade or more.
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:26.520]  When Lisa came, there was no what they call their 2030 plan, which is like reduce carbon
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:31.360]  footprint to net neutral by 2030 across all of Apple and all of its products.
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:34.520]  She created that all of that stuff, but it was really it was a good interview, because
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:40.880]  like, I definitely wanted to tease out which I think it did some things about their specific
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:45.920]  plans and how they think about balancing out things like carbon offsets, which is notoriously
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:49.360]  like how companies greenwash their efforts.
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:55.800]  And Apple uses only 22% carbon offsets, and the vast majority of what they do is actual
[01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:57.520]  real things that they're doing.
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:00.100]  So there's the thing that they call it reduce or restore.
[01:58:00.100 --> 01:58:06.280]  And like reducing is the work any company does to actually reduce the amount of energy
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:09.800]  that they use the manufacturing footprint, all of that stuff.
[01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:15.440]  It's real physical changes in how bad their stuff is for the environment, basically, and
[01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:19.860]  reducing that is a huge portion of what Apple does far more than most corporations, which
[01:58:19.860 --> 01:58:24.720]  tend to rely to the vast majority on carbon offsetting, which is like, okay, we bought
[01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:30.680]  a bunch of rainforest and preserve we're preserving it or they work through brokers to like, preserve
[01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:35.360]  or replace their usage by donating to X, Y or Z.
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:36.700]  So anyhow, it was good.
[01:58:36.700 --> 01:58:44.000]  But I think the fun bit for me was I wanted to ask her about, like, why she joined Apple
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:47.320]  because you could talk about the numbers, but people's eyes tend to glaze over after
[01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:48.320]  a while.
[01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:50.760]  And you want to like kind of bring a human aspect into it.
[01:58:50.760 --> 01:58:53.920]  And so I did get to talk to her a little bit about why she joined Apple because she was
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:57.920]  at the EPA and, you know, led the EPA and had a reputation.
[01:58:57.920 --> 01:59:04.200]  She was at Obama's EPA, had a pretty big role and reputation and a career and all of this
[01:59:04.200 --> 01:59:05.860]  stuff and cachet.
[01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:10.960]  And I think that in some people's eyes at the time, her hire for Apple by Apple was
[01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:16.200]  very much like a, oh, we hired this person from the EPA, you should, it's like a PR move,
[01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:17.200]  right?
[01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:22.520]  Like we're, we're building this reputation for being a green company by trading on her
[01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:23.520]  rep.
[01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:24.520]  Right.
[01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:25.520]  And I literally asked her about that.
[01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:30.580]  I was like, did you have a trepidation that they were just trading on your reputation
[01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:35.080]  with the EPA to like kind of bring you in to be this figurehead that actually had no
[01:59:35.080 --> 01:59:36.080]  real authority.
[01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:37.080]  Right.
[01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:39.820]  And what was the pitch like to get you to come there?
[01:59:39.820 --> 01:59:43.640]  And her answer was basically like, it was Tim, like him personally.
[01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:44.640]  It wasn't some recruiter.
[01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:45.640]  It wasn't somebody in HR.
[01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:49.840]  It wasn't somebody trying to like build out a strategy.
[01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:55.280]  It was literally Tim who came to her and said, and she was like, I won't tell you exact exact
[01:59:55.280 --> 02:00:00.280]  words of use or keep his, some of his secrets, but basically it was, we want you to come
[02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:03.520]  here and build this and you will have real power to do it.
[02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:05.320]  You will report directly to me.
[02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:10.760]  You won't be in some sort of weird offshoot of the organization that has no influence
[02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:14.680]  across the breadth of the company because she's like, if I'm going to do this, it has
[02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:15.680]  to be everywhere, right?
[02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:18.800]  It has to be in manufacturing, supply chain, all of this stuff.
[02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:24.040]  It's not going to be some sort of thing where I publish one PDF a year and deliver one conference
[02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:25.040]  appearance a year.
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:28.760]  And that's Apple's efforts in this regard, right?
[02:00:28.760 --> 02:00:34.880]  Or like at the end of the development project of the iPhone 15, they're going to dump a
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:39.520]  bunch of information on her desk and it's up to her to find a green story to come out
[02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:40.520]  of it.
[02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:44.800]  You know, she's off in a corner now, but that's the cynical way to look at it.
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:48.240]  And that's certainly what I, you know, I would have had the same questions for her.
[02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:54.840]  It's obvious though, going back to our off the record briefings, talking to people at
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:01:01.640]  Apple last week in Cupertino, it is very obviously infused their decision-making in the way that
[02:01:01.640 --> 02:01:09.560]  everybody's always known from the founding of the company in 1977, that the way things
[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:12.760]  look and feel is very important to Apple.
[02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:17.320]  It is just a founding priority that comes right from Steve Jobs, right?
[02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:22.180]  That making things look good is important to Apple.
[02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:27.240]  Making things environmentally right is right there at that level and infuses all of the
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:28.600]  stuff that they do.
[02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:34.240]  Yeah, and we got into that a little bit too because, oh, she was, it was a funny anecdote
[02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:40.840]  because we were, Disrupt is held, it was held this year at Moscone West, which obviously
[02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:46.760]  is where many, many MacWorlds and Apple events have happened over the years.
[02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:52.960]  And she was saying that at the time that she joined, so when Apple, at least on the executive
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:57.920]  level or some level, when you join Apple, your first day is shadowing your boss.
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:02.200]  So your first day is like, you go with your boss and like hang out and see what their
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:04.560]  day is like and kind of do all that.
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:11.960]  And so she said, my first day, I couldn't hang with Tim because he was doing the keynote.
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:13.760]  It's just, she's like, I came and I saw it.
[02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:17.840]  And she goes, actually, my first day at Apple was literally like 40 feet from where we were
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:19.360]  doing our interview on stage.
[02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:21.460]  So she's like a little nostalgic for me.
[02:02:21.460 --> 02:02:23.760]  This is where I had my first day.
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:28.160]  But she said, like, I remember my conversation with Tim backstage because I told him, so
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:30.480]  Tim like, okay, what do you want me to do?
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:32.200]  Like what do you, what do you want me to get started on?
[02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:33.560]  What do you want us to do?
[02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:38.120]  And he said to her, that's what I want you to tell me.
[02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:40.000]  Like I am not prescribing this.
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.920]  I'm telling you to tell us what to do now, right directly.
[02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:52.220]  And that kind of went from there, she says, into like permeating the different departments
[02:02:52.220 --> 02:02:53.220]  at Apple.
[02:02:53.220 --> 02:02:57.160]  She said her team, her specific team is small because they didn't want to create this like
[02:02:57.160 --> 02:03:02.240]  pocket organization that was like, oh, those guys in environmental are up in our crew again
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:04.080]  about this stuff or XYZ.
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:12.240]  Instead, it was taking a small team, generating policies and generating ideas with, in conjunction
[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:16.100]  with the people at the root level of all of the new products that they were going to make
[02:03:16.100 --> 02:03:18.700]  from then, from that point on.
[02:03:18.700 --> 02:03:24.240]  And that goes from in industrial design to processors to engineering, software engineering,
[02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:27.660]  all of it to say, how are we going to fix this?
[02:03:27.660 --> 02:03:29.180]  How they ship products, right?
[02:03:29.180 --> 02:03:34.460]  There's a huge, huge change this year where they're shipping way more products on boats
[02:03:34.460 --> 02:03:39.900]  and it's like a 30 to one reduction in the carbon emitted to get, I mean, let's face
[02:03:39.900 --> 02:03:46.800]  it, they're coming from China and Vietnam to the West coast of the US.
[02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:52.300]  And I think they fit the equivalent of, you know, like when you look at one of those big
[02:03:52.300 --> 02:04:00.240]  shipping boats and they're just full of those tractor trailer size boxes, three of
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:04.920]  those boxes fit on an airplane, about equivalent three, they don't put the boxes on there,
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:11.180]  but the cargo of three, about three of those fit on the cargo size planes that fly across
[02:04:11.180 --> 02:04:12.420]  the Pacific.
[02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:17.100]  I don't know how many of those boxes fit on those boats, but it's hundreds, a thousand.
[02:04:17.100 --> 02:04:18.100]  I don't know.
[02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:19.100]  They're enormous.
[02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:21.420]  They're those boats are skyscraper size.
[02:04:21.420 --> 02:04:25.900]  They're like skyscrapers tilted sideways going across the Pacific.
[02:04:25.900 --> 02:04:30.420]  Obviously the logistics of that, this is right up Tim Cook and Jeff Williams alley, the operational
[02:04:30.420 --> 02:04:36.880]  aspect of, Hey, we don't get to decide two days in advance what's coming from China.
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:41.900]  We were now going to do this at a much slower scale where we've got to wait for this giant
[02:04:41.900 --> 02:04:46.780]  boat to go all the way across the big ocean, the Pacific ocean.
[02:04:46.780 --> 02:04:51.540]  But there's no way that happens without a full buy-in across the company at the operational
[02:04:51.540 --> 02:04:52.540]  level.
[02:04:52.540 --> 02:04:55.740]  And we know that, I mean, it's literally the operations genius is the guy who's been
[02:04:55.740 --> 02:04:58.300]  the CEO of the companies since Steve Jobs died.
[02:04:58.300 --> 02:05:01.820]  I mean, operations are, are central to them.
[02:05:01.820 --> 02:05:06.900]  And I guess the comparison would be, and again, not to disparage the people, the fine, fine
[02:05:06.900 --> 02:05:13.700]  people who I definitely don't want to ever make an enemy of in Apple legal, but right.
[02:05:13.700 --> 02:05:17.860]  But Apple legal, when you talk to people at Apple, they don't talk about like, Oh, but
[02:05:17.860 --> 02:05:19.020]  legal said this legal said that.
[02:05:19.020 --> 02:05:22.820]  And obviously there are aspects of Apple that are embroiled in legal stuff for the whole
[02:05:22.820 --> 02:05:25.580]  Qualcomm patent thing with the modems and stuff.
[02:05:25.580 --> 02:05:28.980]  I mean, I know that everybody who works at Apple eventually has to worry about patents
[02:05:28.980 --> 02:05:33.140]  and some stuff with legal, but legal is a department that you hope never to hear from.
[02:05:33.140 --> 02:05:34.140]  Right.
[02:05:34.140 --> 02:05:37.700]  And Lisa Jackson's environmental stuff is not like that.
[02:05:37.700 --> 02:05:42.460]  Like, Oh God, here comes, she's going to ding us about the tape we're using on the boxes
[02:05:42.460 --> 02:05:43.460]  or whatever.
[02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:47.580]  No, it's like a central infused part of everything Apple does.
[02:05:47.580 --> 02:05:53.260]  I have been part of corporations long enough to understand that no initiative that touches
[02:05:53.260 --> 02:05:59.300]  so many departments like this gets anywhere without complete top down buy-in.
[02:05:59.300 --> 02:06:05.060]  It's not Tim saying, well, if we can do it in a cost effective manner or if we can do
[02:06:05.060 --> 02:06:08.140]  it, it's no, this is what we're doing.
[02:06:08.140 --> 02:06:09.980]  So then let's figure it out.
[02:06:09.980 --> 02:06:15.660]  And I think it has borne out in their ability to execute because the company grew 67% in
[02:06:15.660 --> 02:06:19.980]  profits at the same time they were reducing their carbon footprint by like double digit
[02:06:19.980 --> 02:06:20.980]  percentages.
[02:06:20.980 --> 02:06:21.980]  Right.
[02:06:21.980 --> 02:06:27.100]  And I think that's part of what she says she wanted to do is to demonstrate to the broader
[02:06:27.100 --> 02:06:32.700]  ecosystem that you can make more money because that's what corporations are built to do.
[02:06:32.700 --> 02:06:33.700]  Let's just be honest.
[02:06:33.700 --> 02:06:34.700]  Right.
[02:06:34.700 --> 02:06:38.860]  You can make more money while, while still doing this in fact, not just while doing it,
[02:06:38.860 --> 02:06:42.180]  but it can in fact sometimes be more profitable to do it this way.
[02:06:42.180 --> 02:06:44.700]  You just have to put in the work, right?
[02:06:44.700 --> 02:06:48.220]  And that's why they're being so transparent about all of it and trying to like teach people
[02:06:48.220 --> 02:06:50.980]  to make these truly transformational changes.
[02:06:50.980 --> 02:06:58.180]  And again, shipping way more stuff on enormous boats as opposed to really fast airplanes
[02:06:58.180 --> 02:06:59.860]  is an enormous change.
[02:06:59.860 --> 02:07:00.860]  It's just, it's enormous.
[02:07:00.860 --> 02:07:03.140]  I mean, think about the lead time.
[02:07:03.140 --> 02:07:08.420]  The amount of additional lead time, Apple famously only tries to keep roughly two weeks
[02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:11.300]  worth of inventory in their retail pipeline.
[02:07:11.300 --> 02:07:18.940]  And so to do that with boats instead of planes is just an incredible feat of timing and pressions
[02:07:18.940 --> 02:07:20.060]  and all of that stuff.
[02:07:20.060 --> 02:07:21.060]  Right.
[02:07:21.060 --> 02:07:26.220]  I think it is true too, that even if you're a completely cynical Apple shareholder who
[02:07:26.220 --> 02:07:32.020]  doesn't even give a shit about the future of the environment and the carbon in the atmosphere,
[02:07:32.020 --> 02:07:36.860]  and you're just, all you're interested in is Apple stock go up.
[02:07:36.860 --> 02:07:43.020]  This is, I believe there is a truly strong case to be made that this is actually in your
[02:07:43.020 --> 02:07:49.860]  interest to purely as a cynical bottom line focused person, because as the parent of a
[02:07:49.860 --> 02:07:52.220]  college student, I care about the environment.
[02:07:52.220 --> 02:07:54.340]  I've always voted on this issue.
[02:07:54.340 --> 02:08:00.220]  I've bought hook line and sinker into the whole carbon argument from at least, I don't
[02:08:00.220 --> 02:08:03.820]  remember not thinking about it, like back to the nineties.
[02:08:03.820 --> 02:08:05.820]  The science seemed overwhelming then.
[02:08:05.820 --> 02:08:11.020]  And now we see the evidence now I care, but the degree to which younger people, the generation
[02:08:11.020 --> 02:08:17.620]  my kids are in your kids are in that they truly care about environmental issues cannot
[02:08:17.620 --> 02:08:18.620]  be overstated.
[02:08:18.620 --> 02:08:24.300]  And it's in, and I, it wasn't something when I was in college, nobody gave a shit,
[02:08:24.300 --> 02:08:29.940]  whether the stuff you bought was packaged in plastic or whatever, what the carbon footprint
[02:08:29.940 --> 02:08:32.500]  is, younger people do care.
[02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:33.880]  They really do.
[02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:38.620]  This is not something that, and none of these things, the packaging, the materials, the
[02:08:38.620 --> 02:08:43.700]  way they source the electricity, the shipping, none of this stuff is easy or can be flipped
[02:08:43.700 --> 02:08:44.700]  on a switch.
[02:08:44.700 --> 02:08:46.960]  So I think there's an argument to be made that way.
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:51.620]  And I think, and I think the fact that Lisa Jackson is still there and still a prominent
[02:08:51.620 --> 02:08:55.740]  executive, it just shows that it really is by him anyway.
[02:08:55.740 --> 02:08:57.980]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[02:08:57.980 --> 02:08:59.020]  I think that's about enough.
[02:08:59.020 --> 02:09:00.020]  I know we didn't get to the watch.
[02:09:00.020 --> 02:09:01.180]  I don't really have much to say.
[02:09:01.180 --> 02:09:04.100]  I mean, my, my, my, yeah, I don't either, to be honest.
[02:09:04.100 --> 02:09:09.460]  I mean, it's a relatively small upgrade, essentially kind of like just shoving the new chip in,
[02:09:09.460 --> 02:09:13.660]  which is great, but other than that, yeah, it does seem, I will say with that, because
[02:09:13.660 --> 02:09:16.020]  I use the watch, there's nothing much to do with it.
[02:09:16.020 --> 02:09:18.780]  It does seem like the new chip does get you a lot more battery life.
[02:09:18.780 --> 02:09:21.420]  I didn't charge my, yeah, I have it right now.
[02:09:21.420 --> 02:09:26.860]  I'm still at 24% battery with this watch that I haven't charged since two nights ago.
[02:09:26.860 --> 02:09:28.980]  So it's a series nine.
[02:09:28.980 --> 02:09:33.260]  I think this, my other watches would have been dead by now and it still has 24.
[02:09:33.260 --> 02:09:34.260]  That's it.
[02:09:34.260 --> 02:09:36.260]  There's my short review.
[02:09:36.260 --> 02:09:41.660]  We did not, also did not get to the fact that you are, you're leaving TechCrunch.
[02:09:41.660 --> 02:09:42.700]  I am.
[02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:44.700]  You're leaving me alone.
[02:09:44.700 --> 02:09:47.260]  I'm abandoning you, John.
[02:09:47.260 --> 02:09:48.980]  I'm abandoning you.
[02:09:48.980 --> 02:09:51.020]  First Ren� left for YouTube.
[02:09:51.020 --> 02:09:55.900]  Now you, but I don't feel bad at all not discussing it.
[02:09:55.900 --> 02:10:01.560]  You were just on our good mutual friend, Eli Patel's decoder podcast over there at the
[02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:07.060]  Verge in a full hour long interview talking about your editorship.
[02:10:07.060 --> 02:10:11.740]  And I just got done listening to it last night and I'm like, well, this is great because
[02:10:11.740 --> 02:10:13.740]  I don't have to cover it.
[02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:15.780]  I don't have to cover any of this.
[02:10:15.780 --> 02:10:19.900]  So what I'm, what I want everybody out there to do listening, we're wrapping this podcast
[02:10:19.900 --> 02:10:20.900]  up.
[02:10:20.900 --> 02:10:21.900]  This is over.
[02:10:21.900 --> 02:10:25.060]  If you haven't listened to that episode of decoder, just pretend, just go take a bathroom
[02:10:25.060 --> 02:10:28.780]  break and now just queue up that episode of decoder.
[02:10:28.780 --> 02:10:30.700]  I'm passing things off to Nilay.
[02:10:30.700 --> 02:10:34.580]  Matthew's going to stay here and just talk for the next hour to Nilay about that.
[02:10:34.580 --> 02:10:37.260]  But I will just say, I'm going to miss you, buddy.
[02:10:37.260 --> 02:10:38.260]  Oh, thank you.
[02:10:38.260 --> 02:10:39.260]  Me too.
[02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:43.400]  I mean, obviously you won't be able to escape me on iMessage, but other than that, I will
[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:44.400]  miss it.
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:47.860]  I w it was, it was fun and it's, who's to say if I won't be doing it again at some point,
[02:10:47.860 --> 02:10:49.140]  but I did enjoy it a lot.
[02:10:49.140 --> 02:10:50.840]  I always look forward to seeing you.
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:56.260]  I always love reading your reviews too, because I feel like we separate but parallel tracks
[02:10:56.260 --> 02:11:00.380]  is like the way I look at it, but like such a great, you have a, such a great mind and
[02:11:00.380 --> 02:11:05.420]  I've always enjoyed talking and thinking and absorbing your views on these things, especially
[02:11:05.420 --> 02:11:09.060]  at the events where we were so often kind of thrown together and I love it.
[02:11:09.060 --> 02:11:10.100]  It was a really fun time.
[02:11:10.100 --> 02:11:15.160]  I will cherish that kind of like sequence of events that led me to kind of become friends
[02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:19.660]  with you and take part in this little ecosystem of, of reviewers and all that stuff.
[02:11:19.660 --> 02:11:20.660]  It was fun.
[02:11:20.660 --> 02:11:21.660]  I really enjoyed it.
[02:11:21.660 --> 02:11:22.820]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:11:22.820 --> 02:11:28.140]  I I'll just, I'm going to spoil one small part of the Verge interview with Nilay.
[02:11:28.140 --> 02:11:31.720]  I was hoping the whole time that by the end of it, Nilay was going to convince you to
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:35.060]  work for the Verge so that we could keep this going.
[02:11:35.060 --> 02:11:47.540]  I was hoping to hear you hired on air, but spoiler, it didn't happen anyway.
[02:11:47.540 --> 02:11:49.740]  I'm sure we will still stay in touch.
[02:11:49.740 --> 02:11:50.740]  Thank you.
[02:11:50.740 --> 02:11:51.740]  I'm going to thank our sponsors too.
[02:11:51.740 --> 02:11:56.180]  We had Squarespace where you can build your own website and we had Memberful where you
