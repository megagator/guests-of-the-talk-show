[00:00.000 --> 00:07.560]  Matthew panzerino welcome welcome back to the show. Thank you, sir. Thanks for having me. Wow. It's a tough week to have a show. There's no news
[00:11.240 --> 00:15.560]  Yeah, we might as well just shut it down go on vacation oh
[00:17.200 --> 00:20.340]  Man yeah, it's been like that every day so
[00:21.000 --> 00:28.200]  We are recording on Tuesday the 31st. So we are literally talking like two hours after Apple posted
[00:28.200 --> 00:35.620]  Quarterly results so we can actually do like a news show. It's like we're like on on CNN or something talking about breaking news
[00:36.720 --> 00:40.980]  Right this week's news today or whatever. Yeah, so that yesterday
[00:43.220 --> 00:50.340]  Summarizing the quarterly results, I think it's my summary is more or less
[00:52.260 --> 00:54.740]  iPhone went back to growth which was contrary to
[00:54.740 --> 01:03.140]  some predictions that that that last year's dip was was the sign that that we'd reached to pick peak iPhone
[01:03.500 --> 01:10.340]  People say they sold more iPhones last quarter than they've ever sold in any quarter including the two year ago one when the sales went
[01:10.540 --> 01:12.580]  bananas because of the
[01:12.580 --> 01:15.020]  iPhone 6 and 6 plus
[01:16.660 --> 01:20.260]  iPad sales are down a little bit year over year, but they're
[01:20.260 --> 01:24.500]  Reasonably saying well last year they came out with the brand-new iPad Pro this year
[01:24.500 --> 01:28.380]  There were no new iPads in the holiday quarter, and they're still a respectable 13 million
[01:29.180 --> 01:31.180]  Mac sales were up a little
[01:32.340 --> 01:39.180]  Rebounding I think showing such good signs of probably the the new MacBook Pro sales being pretty good
[01:41.100 --> 01:48.220]  Apple watch they don't break those out, but on the conference call it sounded to me reading the summary that they said it was a
[01:48.220 --> 01:50.540]  A record-breaking quarter now that makes sense
[01:51.060 --> 01:56.260]  Because it's a holiday quarter, and I think that it's if if they did break those watch sales out
[01:56.260 --> 02:01.740]  I think the holiday quarter is gonna be a huge spike. Just like in the old days the way iPods were
[02:02.580 --> 02:07.540]  And then last but not least services Apple's favorite word of the last two years is up
[02:09.060 --> 02:11.060]  Is that a fair summary
[02:11.300 --> 02:12.260]  Yeah, I think so
[02:12.260 --> 02:12.660]  I mean
[02:12.660 --> 02:17.260]  I think there's some question about that other category in like the overall other category
[02:17.260 --> 02:19.500]  Yeah, there was there was a dip in growth
[02:19.500 --> 02:24.920]  But right the what like the general consensus is the watch did fine in the quarter, right?
[02:24.980 --> 02:30.800]  I mean, it's pretty much the only watch that's doing anywhere near decent right now. So it's not too hard to
[02:31.500 --> 02:37.260]  To say that yeah, and it seems to me like I mean, there's a lot of I mean
[02:37.260 --> 02:41.900]  This is a little off topic of Apple's quarter, but it's on point with the watch that
[02:42.460 --> 02:44.460]  I'm starting to see some serious
[02:44.460 --> 02:52.420]  Previous repeated pessimism about Fitbit that Fitbit I think might be in as a company might be in trouble
[02:53.420 --> 02:57.660]  Yes. Yeah, I think that's pretty clear from what we've been hearing so far
[02:57.660 --> 03:04.620]  I think that there's a significant change in direction what we refer to here in Silicon Valley as pivot
[03:05.460 --> 03:12.240]  Coming for them. But yeah, there's they they are definitely and I don't think anybody really thinks that it's
[03:12.240 --> 03:17.640]  Completely about the products. I mean, I think there's plenty of quality issues they've had over the years and they've never been
[03:18.600 --> 03:20.520]  You know super
[03:20.520 --> 03:27.080]  Highly rated as far as durability and longevity and quality and they've had a couple of like actual real problems with quality
[03:27.080 --> 03:34.320]  But I think it's just a tough category and they just didn't quite figure it out. You know, yeah, it's just it
[03:34.840 --> 03:39.980]  It's like they were cool. You know, they stand up they stand alone as the only independent
[03:39.980 --> 03:48.100]  company that's making fitness trackers that that is worth even talking about but it doesn't seem like they've got it over the hump and
[03:48.100 --> 03:52.300]  It's I think in particular Apple watch is is doing them in
[03:53.220 --> 03:54.100]  That yeah
[03:54.100 --> 03:59.020]  I mean this casual market in this casual market of people who want to spend like let's say somewhere around
[03:59.380 --> 04:05.100]  Two three hundred dollars to track their fitness. It seems to me like Apple watch is starting to get
[04:05.100 --> 04:11.900]  Real traction outside the early adopters, you know market and I think it's at Fitbit's expense
[04:13.380 --> 04:15.380]  Yeah, I mean it's sort of the
[04:16.300 --> 04:17.540]  You know you bought a phone
[04:17.540 --> 04:19.540]  I mean used to be I mean maybe
[04:19.540 --> 04:24.540]  What four or five years ago you bought a phone to make phone calls and maybe you write text messages and you got all these
[04:24.540 --> 04:28.640]  Apps with it, you know do all this other stuff and then you come to love that and pretty soon
[04:28.640 --> 04:32.800]  You're not making phone calls at all. You're texting everybody with you know messenger or whatever
[04:32.800 --> 04:36.680]  But I think it's the same kind of concept, you know, so people are saying hey, you know
[04:36.680 --> 04:40.240]  Now the price is getting to where I don't mind spending 200 bucks
[04:41.120 --> 04:44.420]  Getting this thing and getting all these other things with it, but it's a great, you know
[04:44.420 --> 04:50.680]  It's a solid fitness tracker that you can do all these things. So yeah, it's a tough category and as you mentioned it
[04:51.000 --> 04:55.960]  Fitbit, you know is treading alone on the backs of that one P&L, right, right
[04:55.960 --> 05:00.360]  So if you break out the Apple watch as a business, especially that first launch quarter when it launched
[05:00.360 --> 05:07.040]  I mean that stuff takes ramp time, you know, and when it's you're relying on yourself and your own revenues and whatever
[05:07.040 --> 05:10.200]  You know venture capital, obviously you have you don't have
[05:10.840 --> 05:13.720]  Infinite runway. Yeah, you know, yeah, and I think
[05:14.940 --> 05:19.040]  we'll come back to this on another topic in a bit, but
[05:20.320 --> 05:25.880]  I'm as guilty of it. Well, maybe not as anybody but I know I'm guilty of it and
[05:26.280 --> 05:29.000]  I think others who write about technology are
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.240]  seriously guilty of
[05:32.360 --> 05:37.720]  Being to show too focused on the short term and not realizing how long
[05:38.520 --> 05:44.960]  Some things need to really get mainstream acceptance, you know, like just smartphones period you know
[05:44.960 --> 05:47.440]  It was like remember that the what was the initial goal?
[05:47.480 --> 05:52.960]  It was like 10 million iPhones in the first year of sales something like that
[05:54.000 --> 05:55.720]  and
[05:55.720 --> 05:59.760]  There you know, they made it but it's like if you think about that now
[05:59.760 --> 06:07.400]  they sold 78 million phones in three months this last one were and whereas that you know back when it first came out 10 years
[06:07.400 --> 06:11.760]  Ago, it was you know, we're hoping for 10 million in 12 months
[06:12.080 --> 06:16.540]  It it takes a long time, you know, and a part of it is just the simple common sense
[06:16.540 --> 06:18.720]  and I mean other people have written about it, but just
[06:19.120 --> 06:24.000]  There are people like me who will go and buy an iPhone on the day it comes out
[06:24.000 --> 06:30.160]  but most people even if they were curious and I still remember it with the original iPhone where like people on the street would see
[06:30.160 --> 06:35.640]  Me using it and they would say right without knowing who I am. They would just say is that an iPhone right and
[06:36.440 --> 06:37.960]  They were obviously aware of it
[06:37.960 --> 06:42.920]  They probably have one now, but that it took years for them to be comfortable to say, okay
[06:42.920 --> 06:48.600]  I'll get one because I've you know, it there's like a comfort factor of knowing it and I think the watch is on that trajectory
[06:50.440 --> 06:51.840]  Mm-hmm
[06:51.840 --> 06:54.520]  Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think I've definitely had
[06:56.040 --> 06:59.160]  Right now it's it's exited that phase for me
[06:59.160 --> 07:02.280]  It's not like people see it on my wrist and go, you know, like oh my god
[07:02.280 --> 07:07.800]  Is that an Apple watch but what they do say is oh, you know, I'm thinking like it. Are you still using it?
[07:08.040 --> 07:13.940]  Right, which is an interesting way to phrase it, right and I think that that's partially from the narrative
[07:13.940 --> 07:18.080]  You know, I guess you could call it media narrative or whatever. Mm-hmm
[07:18.080 --> 07:24.480]  that the watch isn't all that useful long-term that there's an initial an initial wave of like
[07:24.480 --> 07:27.520]  Oh, hey, I'm poking around and then eventually you get tired of it and put it away
[07:27.520 --> 07:31.880]  And I definitely know that there are plenty of people that don't wear those anymore or whatever, right?
[07:31.880 --> 07:36.180]  There's gonna be that with any gadget. It doesn't fit either what the company
[07:36.920 --> 07:39.680]  Tried to sell you it was or what, you know
[07:39.680 --> 07:45.960]  Whatever their success or failure in communicating what it was was or your own vision of how it would fit into your life
[07:45.960 --> 07:51.520]  Didn't quite match up with how it actually did right? And so I think that we've exited that phase and
[07:51.880 --> 07:57.600]  Now we're in the phase where the people that are still wearing it are advocating in ways that are more specific
[07:57.920 --> 08:02.040]  They're like, yes. I love it because XY. Yeah, right. It's not like oh, yeah
[08:02.040 --> 08:04.360]  I love it and then like what do you like about it?
[08:04.360 --> 08:07.680]  Well, look at all these things and this thing and that thing I don't think we're out of that
[08:07.800 --> 08:11.840]  And we're into these are the practical benefits it offers me. Oh, yeah
[08:11.840 --> 08:16.200]  I have all my calendar stuff on there like that's enough for most people or I have you know
[08:16.200 --> 08:17.200]  It's a great fitness tracker
[08:17.200 --> 08:22.120]  You know, I go to the gym every day or I cycle or I swim or you know, etc
[08:22.120 --> 08:24.760]  Etc. People are figuring out the things that work for them
[08:24.760 --> 08:30.700]  And so it's it's more about the precise benefits on an individual basis
[08:31.320 --> 08:38.200]  Versus the entire, you know bolus of benefits that could theoretically apply to you, you know
[08:38.200 --> 08:44.320]  And I think that that that could be where the sustained growth is coming from versus the initial wave of who knows
[08:44.520 --> 08:51.520]  Yeah, it's also true that I mean we knew this this isn't something we needed that to hear from Tim Cook on the conference call
[08:51.520 --> 08:56.520]  Today you could tell just by going to the Apple Store and trying to buy an Apple watch that they were backordered
[08:56.680 --> 08:58.680]  for most of last quarter
[08:58.840 --> 09:00.840]  Or still are I think
[09:00.840 --> 09:05.280]  That you know, they couldn't make them fast enough, which is a good sign, I guess
[09:05.280 --> 09:07.280]  Yeah
[09:07.320 --> 09:07.880]  I mean
[09:07.880 --> 09:08.160]  I think
[09:08.160 --> 09:09.240]  Initially, you know
[09:09.240 --> 09:15.180]  You never know whether they just didn't know how many to make or what or whether they didn't know what the right mix was
[09:15.180 --> 09:21.040]  I think they're initially there was a lot more people buying steel than maybe they thought and so there was you know
[09:21.040 --> 09:23.040]  It's incredibly hard to get steel ones for a long time
[09:23.240 --> 09:25.500]  But now I think they're getting the mix figured out
[09:25.560 --> 09:30.900]  So if they have the mix figured out that eliminates that and now you are looking at yeah
[09:31.040 --> 09:35.080]  They're just having a hard time keeping up with it, which theoretically should be a good thing
[09:35.080 --> 09:37.960]  On the flip side, they aren't keeping up with it
[09:37.960 --> 09:42.880]  So they're not selling as many as they could which is you know, not great for your shareholders or whatever you want to call it
[09:42.880 --> 09:44.880]  Yeah
[09:44.880 --> 09:49.420]  With iPhone sales rebounding and actually growing and breaking a record
[09:50.560 --> 09:52.040]  it
[09:52.040 --> 09:58.840]  Even with that even saying it's a record. It's clear. It's it's a few fractions of a percentage, you know
[09:58.840 --> 10:02.000]  I think it's 78 million. They sold into one two years ago
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.560]  That was the previous record was like 74 million phones or something like that
[10:05.960 --> 10:09.320]  so the the years of rah-rah
[10:09.960 --> 10:17.280]  50% growth year over year are over and I think that you know common sense would tell you why it's because the smartphone is sort
[10:17.280 --> 10:18.960]  of a
[10:18.960 --> 10:25.180]  Saturated product. I mean not that there's no room for growth and in certain markets, but for the most part over the last 10 years
[10:25.180 --> 10:27.180]  We've reached the point where?
[10:27.180 --> 10:30.900]  Almost everybody who might get a smartphone has a smartphone
[10:33.380 --> 10:35.380]  Right, well, I mean I think
[10:36.580 --> 10:38.820]  It looks like there was some declines in China
[10:39.940 --> 10:46.860]  But every other market grew. Yeah, which is that's pretty solid. I mean China is its own beast
[10:47.020 --> 10:51.220]  You know, it's incredibly difficult to do business there as Apple has found over the years, you know
[10:51.220 --> 10:54.060]  And we only know the public stuff. We don't know that
[10:54.060 --> 10:59.860]  The many challenges they've come up against with the government and everything else that don't quite make it to the page
[11:01.340 --> 11:07.700]  But outside of that every other region was growing and I think that people think of saturation and
[11:08.300 --> 11:13.500]  Replacement cycles and things like that the people that do think of those things are not
[11:14.420 --> 11:21.220]  They're not communicating it. Well, or I should say that they communicate it fine in there in their vein, but it's hard to
[11:21.220 --> 11:22.860]  To
[11:22.860 --> 11:25.300]  Characterize those things and turn them into very human
[11:25.700 --> 11:30.300]  you know sentences or or ideas or concepts for people that
[11:30.740 --> 11:36.780]  Can help them understand where the growth is coming from and where the sustained growth will come from because it's like you could say hey
[11:36.780 --> 11:43.900]  You know every every X years people are gonna replace their iPhone and that changes based on you know, major design changes
[11:43.900 --> 11:48.260]  Right. So in a major design change year the replacement cycle may be lowered by 30%
[11:48.260 --> 11:50.780]  and then you can also go to like
[11:51.420 --> 11:59.060]  You know, there's new people being born. So people are turning what 12 or 13 or 14 now that were you know
[11:59.780 --> 12:06.540]  Just born when the iPhone came out and they're getting phones. So we're getting into like the first wave of like I
[12:07.100 --> 12:12.620]  Don't know a new iPhone consumers first generation of new iPhone consumers. So there are lots of factors
[12:12.620 --> 12:16.180]  It's a very like liquid thing and everybody treats it like oh, yeah
[12:16.180 --> 12:19.780]  Everybody has a phone one hat, you know has one once one and that's it
[12:19.780 --> 12:25.820]  But I think Apple is looking at growth in terms of all of these variables and and the projections show
[12:25.820 --> 12:31.700]  You know revenue projection guidance wise, you know, it's like 51 I guess to 53 billion something like that
[12:31.700 --> 12:37.060]  Yeah that they're projecting which is not crazy high but not light by any means
[12:37.060 --> 12:41.420]  And so I think that you know, I think that they feel that they've got the growth out there
[12:41.420 --> 12:45.240]  Yeah in those pockets and I think that
[12:45.240 --> 12:46.640]  I
[12:46.640 --> 12:48.640]  think a lot of people
[12:48.920 --> 12:56.560]  Saw, you know long story short last year for the calendar year iPhone sales were down year over year the success
[12:57.120 --> 13:01.960]  Seemingly didn't sell as or didn't sell as well as the six
[13:02.840 --> 13:08.600]  and I say that my only hesitation in saying that is is my presumption that most iPhone sold are the
[13:08.840 --> 13:15.040]  The new you know the top-of-the-line new model and because you don't know they don't break that down for competitive reasons
[13:15.040 --> 13:17.880]  So in theory, you know, they could have sold, you know
[13:17.880 --> 13:24.200]  The iPhone SE could secretly be the best-selling iPhone but anecdotally it certainly seems that that
[13:24.680 --> 13:27.800]  Doesn't seem the way most people buy the the best one
[13:28.320 --> 13:30.040]  I
[13:30.040 --> 13:37.480]  Think some people saw last year's slight dip and thought, you know, whether it was just to be dramatic and you know make
[13:38.440 --> 13:39.640]  clickbait predictions
[13:39.640 --> 13:47.080]  but you know saw it as the beginning of a trend as opposed to the counter argument was just that it looked like a dip because
[13:47.080 --> 13:55.000]  The six was such an outlier in terms of there having been so much pent-up demand for a quote-unquote bigger iPhone
[13:55.840 --> 13:57.840]  mm-hmm
[13:58.200 --> 14:04.800]  And I think this you know, the the numbers they just announced for the iPhone 7 certainly back that up that it's it was just an
[14:04.800 --> 14:05.920]  outlier
[14:05.920 --> 14:13.160]  Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think the plus I guess Tim said on the call that the iPhone 7 plus was the highest portion
[14:13.640 --> 14:18.760]  Was higher portion of the mix than in the past. Yeah, so that you know
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.440]  People are getting acclimated to the larger phones that increases their profit margins
[14:23.680 --> 14:29.240]  Obviously because the larger phones don't cost them, you know, whatever percent larger whatever percent more to make
[14:29.240 --> 14:36.080]  It increases their ASP their average selling price, which is always a guidance point that like analysts
[14:36.080 --> 14:40.400]  Love to look at because it means that for every every amount of ounce of effort
[14:40.400 --> 14:46.520]  They put into marketing or whatever the case may be the return is higher, you know, because you've got that individual unit
[14:46.520 --> 14:52.160]  That's a higher higher price and it really costs you roughly the same amount to sell that as it does anything else
[14:52.160 --> 15:00.000]  You know, it's like growing a tall tree versus a short tree. I mean, they're both trees, right? Yeah, so there's there's a definite like
[15:01.040 --> 15:06.160]  Positivity around that I thought I've been seeing that the bigger phones or people are loving them
[15:06.320 --> 15:11.760]  they're taking them up and they're they're buying more of them than ever it is interesting and
[15:12.520 --> 15:15.360]  You know, I think Apple is pretty good at this stuff
[15:15.360 --> 15:22.120]  But it's always interesting to see them admit that they don't that their their estimates were off and it's you know
[15:22.120 --> 15:26.880]  Like you said that they've admitted that the the mix of the plus to the non plus seven
[15:26.960 --> 15:30.660]  Even though that the regular iPhone 7 they said was the best-selling model
[15:30.860 --> 15:35.200]  The plus sold better this year than it has I guess in the previous two years
[15:35.960 --> 15:40.260]  And that the highest mix of them, you know, then versus the other right?
[15:41.400 --> 15:46.600]  Makes me wonder in particular if the the the camera in particular
[15:46.600 --> 15:52.400]  I mean, it's gotta be right. I mean, yeah sure part of it is just getting used to bigger size
[15:52.560 --> 15:56.720]  But the camera has to drive like X percent of it. Like I'm not I'm not pulling out a number
[15:56.760 --> 16:03.840]  Let's say 30% of the decisions to buy that phone where oh, it's got the better camera. So let's get that one, right?
[16:04.400 --> 16:06.600]  and it seems like something that
[16:08.120 --> 16:10.400]  You can see it when you're in the store
[16:10.400 --> 16:14.720]  Like if you go in the store and you're on the fence over whether to get an iPhone 7 or 7 plus
[16:14.720 --> 16:21.040]  The starting this year you can tell just by looking without even trying the camera. It looks different, right?
[16:21.040 --> 16:22.560]  It's it's double the size
[16:22.560 --> 16:29.840]  it looks like it, you know, you can see that it has like optic the the previous years that's the plus models had the optical image
[16:30.080 --> 16:36.620]  Stabilization with it starting with the six. It was for stills only and then the success added it for video
[16:37.840 --> 16:39.840]  That's a great feature
[16:40.240 --> 16:42.240]  especially for video, I mean, it's
[16:42.240 --> 16:44.040]  I
[16:44.040 --> 16:48.440]  It's almost unbelievable how good some of my little home family videos come out now
[16:49.000 --> 16:51.560]  Yeah, because of image stabilization on video
[16:54.560 --> 16:59.680]  But you can't see it in the store so it's just a bullet point and everybody is I think
[17:01.760 --> 17:09.340]  You build up an immunity to bullet points because every time you buy anything whether it's a car or a toaster oven, you know
[17:09.340 --> 17:14.700]  It everything has bullet points. Yeah, here's the features that your coffee maker has twelve cups
[17:15.620 --> 17:19.340]  You know, it has an alarm coffee right makes coffee
[17:22.340 --> 17:27.260]  Whereas you just look at the back of the seven plus and you could it the idea that the
[17:27.460 --> 17:32.440]  Camera is better on this one than the smaller one. It seems visceral because you just look at it
[17:32.440 --> 17:34.860]  I can't help but think that that actually successfully
[17:34.860 --> 17:39.460]  Bumped sales of this which in turn makes me think. Yeah that if you know
[17:41.100 --> 17:48.900]  They may not be done we this might just be the start of the bigger more expensive iPhone having tangibly better camera technology
[17:49.740 --> 17:54.740]  Just because it seems like it's proof that it can drive sales. I think you're you're right
[17:54.740 --> 17:56.740]  There are two things that I think are really
[17:57.700 --> 18:02.300]  Driving this I am 100% agree that the difference could actually you know
[18:02.300 --> 18:07.500]  The physical difference the way it looks could definitely make a big difference
[18:07.500 --> 18:12.860]  But you're right on there and it I know there will people be people that listen to this and they'll laugh
[18:12.860 --> 18:16.020]  They'll be like, oh, yeah, you know people are just looking at the back of it and going
[18:16.020 --> 18:22.020]  Oh, yeah, this one's bigger got a bigger camera thingy on it. I'm gonna buy that but I think people would be shocked
[18:23.220 --> 18:28.780]  Especially people that listen to this show which you know the subset of people that are in the world that listen to this show
[18:29.620 --> 18:31.460]  You know how much higher?
[18:31.460 --> 18:36.060]  Technical savvy than average probably do a lot more research on products than average, you know
[18:36.060 --> 18:39.860]  If you were doing a demographic survey, I think that none of these things would be surprising, right?
[18:40.260 --> 18:45.620]  But I think people underestimate very heavily how little research people do when they go to buy stuff in a store
[18:45.980 --> 18:51.140]  like they'll go to the store to get a phone not having looked at a single thing online or
[18:51.540 --> 18:57.360]  Asked anybody or whatever and they'll just go and they'll just like I want the best along x or y
[18:57.360 --> 19:03.460]  personal access, you know best camera or most storage or whatever honestly
[19:03.460 --> 19:10.200]  Whatever most recent problem they had is probably how they pick and I've seen this myself. I used to work in big-box retail and
[19:11.080 --> 19:15.400]  You know, I've sold a lot of different things over the years, but one of the times I was selling
[19:16.120 --> 19:22.040]  Like digital cameras, especially this is like early in the early digital camera days very early and you know
[19:22.040 --> 19:25.160]  Somebody comes in is looking like a Mavic like a Sony Mavic
[19:25.160 --> 19:30.640]  I was one of the ones that took the floppy disks. Yeah, you would throw those in there and you know, they they
[19:31.800 --> 19:36.560]  Honestly nine times out of ten. All they want is which one has the biggest number on the box
[19:36.760 --> 19:38.840]  They would literally look at the boxes and they go
[19:38.840 --> 19:41.720]  Oh, this one has ten that one has eight and you're like, well, yes
[19:41.720 --> 19:43.720]  but the one that's I mean if you're
[19:44.160 --> 19:49.880]  an honest person you go the one that's eight that's slightly less is actually better for you because I don't know it has this swivel
[19:49.880 --> 19:51.880]  Thing and you really need that for whatever you're doing
[19:51.880 --> 19:58.000]  But if you don't have that person there that decision is getting made based on the number on the box, right?
[19:58.000 --> 20:02.000]  Hey, that's ten. This one's eight. I'll get the ten, right? I have the money. That's fine
[20:02.000 --> 20:05.340]  Let's go and I think that people make those decisions
[20:05.760 --> 20:08.920]  that way a lot more than most people think and even though
[20:09.440 --> 20:15.520]  Apple store employees are theoretically better informed than your average big-box retailer. They don't have the time
[20:16.040 --> 20:19.080]  Apple stores are more crowded than ever people are making decisions without
[20:19.080 --> 20:23.560]  Intervention by an employee and just asking the employee to set it up for them
[20:23.560 --> 20:28.720]  and hopefully the employee may be intervenes at some point if they feel it's the wrong product for them and tries to switch them to
[20:28.720 --> 20:34.760]  Something that is but there's no guarantees. So I think that literally the physical difference in the camera
[20:35.200 --> 20:42.040]  could make a real big difference for people because of those reasons and it's it seems silly or
[20:42.680 --> 20:47.180]  Obvious or whatever but people are silly and obvious when they buy, you know
[20:47.180 --> 20:50.120]  That's just the vast majority of consumers of that way
[20:50.800 --> 20:55.160]  and I think it's also telling how long Apple has stuck with the
[20:55.520 --> 21:02.680]  Shot shot on iPhone ad campaign, you know and and you know Schiller said it when he was on my show. I
[21:03.400 --> 21:08.000]  Forget if it was last year the first time two years ago where I I think it name drop
[21:08.640 --> 21:10.840]  But I asked him like dude
[21:10.840 --> 21:14.300]  I think it was two years ago because I think last year would have it was so obvious
[21:14.300 --> 21:16.960]  it would have it was too late to ask but I just said like
[21:17.600 --> 21:19.600]  It do you consider Apple?
[21:19.920 --> 21:24.520]  One of the leading camera companies in the world and his answer was the leading camera company in the world
[21:24.520 --> 21:26.720]  I mean, it's totally how he sees
[21:26.720 --> 21:32.800]  You know it the importance of the camera on the on the phone and I really there's no other explanation
[21:32.800 --> 21:35.640]  I can think of for why this the mix of plus to non plus
[21:36.320 --> 21:42.800]  Would grow up this year because one of the big complaints about the iPhone 7 is that it quote unquote looks just like the iPhone
[21:42.800 --> 21:48.040]  6 and success that it's otherwise there. Mm-hmm. There's I just it just seems like
[21:49.000 --> 21:50.760]  obvious
[21:50.760 --> 21:56.360]  Yeah, it's it's a it's a great lever to get people to buy that bigger phone
[21:57.200 --> 22:02.640]  Even though they don't want the bigger screen, you know, because people are often just shocked by how large it is
[22:02.640 --> 22:04.480]  Physically when they hold it, you know
[22:04.480 --> 22:06.540]  If I hand somebody my if I have a seven now
[22:06.540 --> 22:11.600]  But like I often use the seven plus especially when I'm traveling and so if I hand it to somebody there
[22:11.600 --> 22:14.320]  Oh, man, this is big, you know, if they've never used one or held one
[22:15.760 --> 22:22.960]  But it's a testament to how how driven by camera people are when they'll don't put up with that so to speak and
[22:24.000 --> 22:29.180]  Knowing how hard the camera team at Apple had to push
[22:29.680 --> 22:36.920]  To make this thing even work right the dual camera thing, which is fairly it's a really significant technical
[22:36.920 --> 22:42.540]  You know achievement and if some other company had done this, I mean Apple, you know
[22:42.540 --> 22:44.180]  They toot their own horn a lot, right?
[22:44.180 --> 22:48.540]  But if some other company had done this they they would have tooted it ten times as much
[22:48.540 --> 22:55.680]  This is actually a very very very very difficult technical problem that they achieved here and it out of everything in the camera
[22:57.460 --> 22:58.860]  The
[22:58.860 --> 23:00.900]  Excuse me out of everything in the phone
[23:01.340 --> 23:06.860]  The camera is really the only thing that's pushing the processor to its limits
[23:06.860 --> 23:12.660]  It's absolute peak limits right now, you know, I mean, you know a game or whatever the case may be
[23:12.660 --> 23:16.380]  They know what the limits are and they work within those but most games
[23:16.900 --> 23:21.900]  On average that people play aren't really pushing that hard games is probably the number two category
[23:22.140 --> 23:29.440]  But above that and up far above anything else that most people do on their phones or most of the capabilities of the phone
[23:29.440 --> 23:31.220]  Which are pretty well known by now
[23:31.220 --> 23:37.700]  the camera in that net 7 plus with its dual lens and in twin capture and
[23:38.100 --> 23:41.660]  Blending of the pair of photos and all of the stuff that it does
[23:41.660 --> 23:46.220]  It really is pushing very very hard that a series chip. So
[23:46.860 --> 23:51.100]  It's like a leading driver of the power the chip power
[23:51.260 --> 23:57.820]  That's in the phone because that chip does and has done everything it needs to do for most people for a very long time
[23:57.820 --> 24:05.420]  You know for several generations. Yeah, and so it's it's driving forward the processing capability and power of the phone
[24:05.780 --> 24:11.180]  and I think it's you know, driving sales along with it and it's it was clearly instrumental in the
[24:12.180 --> 24:14.140]  portrait mode or is
[24:14.140 --> 24:20.700]  You know, like why you know, why why did portrait mode and the dual mode thing ship this year?
[24:20.700 --> 24:24.380]  I mean part of it was I think that the camera engineering just the camera itself
[24:24.380 --> 24:30.460]  It took a long time. I think it's complicated and just the the the algorithm of how are you going to?
[24:31.100 --> 24:35.100]  Use these two lenses for zooming and and etcetera, etcetera
[24:35.260 --> 24:37.660]  but I think another part of it too was that it was
[24:37.820 --> 24:43.660]  Coincident with the a series chip getting fast enough that you can do this on the fly from what I know about how?
[24:44.140 --> 24:49.740]  Long it took them to build this and obviously everybody knows that it didn't ship with the phone, right?
[24:49.740 --> 24:55.740]  It shipped the ships over weeks later, right? I don't think that was strategic. No, I think it was necessary
[24:55.740 --> 25:02.220]  Yeah, it was it was absolutely necessary for them to actually make it work like finish it and and get it to work
[25:02.220 --> 25:06.220]  And that doesn't happen if you've been able to do it for a processor generation, right?
[25:06.220 --> 25:12.700]  You literally Matthew Banser, you know, we're the first person I knew who had access to it because you got a
[25:13.260 --> 25:17.420]  Pre-release version of it at least a couple of days ahead of the beta coming out
[25:17.420 --> 25:23.340]  And you had like a nice little exclusive on on techcrunch with with adorable pictures of your your daughter
[25:25.020 --> 25:29.580]  But they were really good when they picked they chose well because you're you know, you've got a background in photography
[25:29.580 --> 25:34.860]  So you're not just sitting there shooting pictures of your you know, I don't know your desk or whatever
[25:35.420 --> 25:37.420]  Yeah, but I think you could I
[25:37.660 --> 25:44.940]  Even when it first came out and they let us use the beta there were performance problems with it that that have since been ironed out
[25:44.940 --> 25:48.940]  And now it's just there is a sort of it just works. You put it in portrait mode
[25:48.940 --> 25:52.540]  The preview is live the phone doesn't get hot and it just works
[25:53.420 --> 25:57.820]  Yeah, that stuff is being iterated on as we speak like you and I are talking right now. It's four o'clock
[25:58.380 --> 26:04.940]  You know, I'm sure the camera team is still working on updates to that thing, right? Because it's it's a living
[26:06.060 --> 26:11.180]  document, you know in terms of the way that it performs the edge detection gets better every iteration and the
[26:11.180 --> 26:16.540]  Edge detection gets better every iteration and the the blur effect gets more organic and more natural
[26:16.780 --> 26:22.060]  You know that they're able to push that processor via optimization because obviously the hardware hasn't changed, right?
[26:22.460 --> 26:24.700]  So they are able to optimize the processes further
[26:24.780 --> 26:30.060]  So they're able to do more and more complex calculations on that but it really is bleeding edge stuff like there
[26:30.220 --> 26:34.540]  No, nobody else is pushing this hard and people were very quick, you know when I
[26:35.100 --> 26:39.740]  Published that preview and then eventually when when we did the like the review of the phone and stuff like that
[26:39.740 --> 26:45.340]  People were very quick to say oh, you know, well this model or that model from some other brand has been doing this for years
[26:45.900 --> 26:47.180]  yada yada
[26:47.180 --> 26:48.860]  um
[26:48.860 --> 26:52.460]  It's true that other brands have done this faux blur thing
[26:52.940 --> 26:55.840]  But not in this way and not to this level of sophistication
[26:56.300 --> 27:00.060]  And to be honest, even though some of the results were kind of hinky up front
[27:00.460 --> 27:00.860]  You know
[27:00.860 --> 27:06.960]  What's going to get better because they're dedicated to making it better and they have they know this is a primary driver of purchases
[27:06.960 --> 27:12.240]  Whereas a lot of these other phones it was a one-off gimmick to try and sell phones that quarter
[27:12.880 --> 27:16.480]  And really is going to get no significant updates in the future, you know
[27:17.040 --> 27:20.880]  And it's it's a shame but nobody else is really driving like that. Samsung works
[27:21.440 --> 27:26.800]  Sort of backwards right from like, oh, you know, what? What do we think the market wants this quarter?
[27:27.200 --> 27:33.440]  Let's try to produce that and then you know, they're i'm not saying that their their products are not, you know solid or
[27:33.440 --> 27:41.280]  You know decent or whatever if they don't explode but there is there is a drive there to get that kind of stuff, right?
[27:41.920 --> 27:43.920]  Because they know
[27:44.000 --> 27:50.880]  That this is the thing that people want. It's not it's not what they say they want which is more megapixels or
[27:51.520 --> 27:55.360]  You know sharper images or these crude terms that they use to describe it
[27:55.680 --> 28:00.960]  It's actually they want their pictures to look more like pictures and that's a really nebulous thing until you you know
[28:00.960 --> 28:05.600]  You sort of figure out how to define that and I think they spend a lot of time trying to define that for people
[28:06.400 --> 28:08.400]  yeah, I also think
[28:08.720 --> 28:15.360]  It is the clearest path that I can think of because I I fail in certain other forms of imagination
[28:15.760 --> 28:19.760]  of how how can the iPhone continue to get better and
[28:21.440 --> 28:23.360]  There are some little things, you know, like
[28:23.360 --> 28:30.000]  Like the true tone color that the ipad pro has that would be great to eventually have it on the iphone 2
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.920]  There's you know, but the I can't see the display
[28:34.560 --> 28:39.440]  Quality quality wise getting radically better so much so that it would that's why you'd get a new phone
[28:40.080 --> 28:46.000]  everybody is there's rumors that are rampant that the industrial design is going to change and they're going to get rid of the head and
[28:46.160 --> 28:51.040]  forehead and just sort of go from a top to bottom left to right edge to edge display and
[28:51.040 --> 28:53.040]  Visually, that would be very striking
[28:53.600 --> 28:55.280]  if it looks
[28:55.280 --> 28:59.680]  Super cool, then I could see that driving sales. But how many you know after you do that?
[28:59.680 --> 29:04.880]  How does it keep going? Whereas the camera can continue to get better every 12 months?
[29:05.200 --> 29:08.720]  maybe not in a radical way because you run up into limits of physics, but
[29:10.000 --> 29:13.280]  You know in lens optics but in a tangible way
[29:14.000 --> 29:17.040]  And that if you're only if you're on like a two or three year upgrade cycle
[29:17.040 --> 29:23.040]  You can get a radically better camera every time you upgrade to a new phone that to me could continue to drive
[29:23.760 --> 29:26.880]  Sales about where we are right now for the iphone for years to come
[29:29.680 --> 29:30.640]  Yeah
[29:30.640 --> 29:37.220]  Yeah, there's there's not much else for them to chip away at and I think there will be new opportunities
[29:37.920 --> 29:44.640]  In other categories that may even involve the camera, you know, ar augmented reality or vr or whatever the case
[29:44.640 --> 29:50.580]  Augmented reality or vr or whatever the case but as far as like the on device components
[29:51.120 --> 29:54.560]  Uh, they're they're pretty well along towards uh, you know
[29:55.360 --> 29:57.360]  Diminishing returns, right?
[29:57.600 --> 30:03.440]  So yeah, I agree camera's camera's a primary driver there. All right, let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor
[30:03.440 --> 30:07.840]  It's a new sponsor. I'm very excited about this company. It's a company called ministry of supply
[30:08.640 --> 30:10.160]  ministry of supply
[30:10.160 --> 30:11.280]  uh
[30:11.280 --> 30:13.120]  makes performance
[30:13.120 --> 30:18.080]  Dress clothes. What does that mean? Well, it was launched by a bunch of a group of former, uh,
[30:18.640 --> 30:20.640]  engineers engineering students from mit
[30:21.120 --> 30:22.000]  and
[30:22.000 --> 30:22.800]  they
[30:22.800 --> 30:24.800]  make fabrics
[30:24.800 --> 30:29.520]  Performance fabrics the type of things that are on like gym clothes, but they use them to make
[30:30.160 --> 30:32.880]  Uh dress clothes like stuff that you'd wear to work
[30:34.080 --> 30:37.760]  They are breathable. They are flexible. They are way more comfortable
[30:37.760 --> 30:44.720]  Uh, totally feel different, uh, even less resistant. They're even more resistant to wrinkles. I shouldn't say less resistant more resistant
[30:45.600 --> 30:51.520]  Uh, they sent me some samples. They sent me a jacket really nice jacket and a very nice dress shirt. The dress shirt is is
[30:52.240 --> 30:54.240]  Uh, really really nice. Uh
[30:54.720 --> 31:00.560]  Feels great looks great. Uh, and even when I took it out of the box my wife even commented on the shirt
[31:00.720 --> 31:02.080]  She was like, whoa, what is that?
[31:02.080 --> 31:05.680]  You know because it just looks a little different not like in terms of like weird
[31:05.680 --> 31:09.280]  But just sort of like has like a nice sheen to it. It was very very nice
[31:09.840 --> 31:11.840]  They also sent me some socks just socks
[31:12.400 --> 31:14.400]  And they're very comfortable socks
[31:14.880 --> 31:16.080]  uh
[31:16.080 --> 31:20.480]  So here's what a one of the examples, uh men's future forward dress shirt
[31:20.480 --> 31:27.520]  I think that's the one they sent me it regulates your body temperature based on your surroundings keeps you warmer when it's cold keeps you cooler
[31:27.840 --> 31:34.320]  When it's warm their dress shots are made out of coffee fibers that whisk sweat and absorb odor
[31:34.320 --> 31:39.600]  They provide extreme cushion and are shockingly comfortable. I can vouch for that. The socks are super comfortable
[31:40.400 --> 31:44.640]  Uh, no risk. They offer free shipping free returns and a 100 day
[31:44.640 --> 31:51.440]  No questions asked return policy so you can buy your clothes get your shirt find out. It's the slightly wrong size
[31:51.440 --> 31:56.800]  Maybe you should have gotten a one a little smaller a little bigger send it back totally free up to 100 days
[31:57.760 --> 31:59.200]  Couldn't be better
[31:59.200 --> 32:05.840]  Go to their website is ministryofsupply.com
[32:05.840 --> 32:11.120]  Slash the talk show ministryofsupply.com slash the talk show
[32:12.480 --> 32:14.480]  And what they'll do if you go there
[32:14.800 --> 32:19.120]  Is they will send you a free pair of their moisture wicking dress socks
[32:19.760 --> 32:24.800]  For free a $15 value with your first purchase and they also have seven retail stores
[32:24.800 --> 32:31.760]  Uh, including bethesda maryland chicago and atlanta and you can go into their retail stores if there's one near you and just mention
[32:32.080 --> 32:38.320]  The talk show when you check out and you'll get that same free pair of socks. So my thanks to ministry of supply
[32:39.680 --> 32:42.400]  A great great sponsor. Love it. Really really cool stuff
[32:43.280 --> 32:45.280]  What next on the on the?
[32:45.520 --> 32:48.320]  The results front ipad maybe
[32:48.320 --> 32:53.440]  I've had sales were 16 million last year at the same quarter and third down to 13 million this quarter
[32:55.840 --> 32:57.840]  I don't know what to make of that
[32:58.560 --> 33:00.560]  I don't know. I mean, I think that
[33:03.200 --> 33:09.680]  I think we're still we're still trying to find the the replacement cycle and I
[33:10.320 --> 33:16.240]  At the bottom of it, you know the the the um, what do you call it the bottom the bottom of the pendulum arc?
[33:16.240 --> 33:20.720]  But where it starts to swing back up and people repurchase or steady stabilizes anyway
[33:22.960 --> 33:26.800]  Yeah, I don't know I mean I think that there's two schools of thought on this I think you could argue
[33:27.360 --> 33:33.920]  That you know ipads are built really well and they handle, you know, single tasks and it's sort of like you got a
[33:34.720 --> 33:36.720]  apple sold
[33:38.000 --> 33:40.000]  A framing hammer
[33:40.160 --> 33:42.320]  To someone to hang pictures
[33:42.320 --> 33:48.000]  Right. So like the you know, you go to the hardware store. There's five kinds of hammer there
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.320]  There's uh, you know picture hanging hammer which comes in a little like plastic
[33:53.120 --> 33:55.120]  you know, uh
[33:55.120 --> 33:59.440]  Bubble pack and it's got like a few finish nails and the hammer it's like if you hammer anything
[34:00.080 --> 34:06.480]  Bigger than a teeny-tiny nail into plaster or whatever. It just the hit the head falls off, right?
[34:06.480 --> 34:12.960]  And you go all the way up the scale through all the different hammers to a framing hammer and a framing hammer
[34:14.080 --> 34:20.800]  Is a hammer that like slams in 10 penny nails to two by fours or two by sixes on a on a construction lot
[34:20.800 --> 34:22.800]  Right. The framing hammer is reinforced
[34:22.960 --> 34:29.440]  Uh, it's got a like a long tang. That's that's you know, really thoroughly embedded in the head and when you swing that thing
[34:29.440 --> 34:32.560]  Bang, you know it goes it's got a waffle head to so, you know
[34:32.560 --> 34:37.440]  The nail got nice and and trunked down and you can see that you got your imprint on that board
[34:37.440 --> 34:42.560]  So, you know, the nails driven all the way home and you could just wail away on that for 10 years and you that hammer will last you right
[34:43.200 --> 34:45.200]  So apple sold
[34:45.200 --> 34:49.440]  People framing hammers and they're they're hemming in picture frames
[34:50.240 --> 34:52.480]  So you've got you know
[34:54.160 --> 35:01.600]  A 10 year old or five-year-old or heck even a teenager or or an adult who uses it to browse the web and and
[35:01.600 --> 35:07.440]  for a variety of different apps that don't really push the capabilities of the ipad in any significant way
[35:08.080 --> 35:09.760]  And they're like this is fine
[35:09.760 --> 35:16.080]  Why can't I just keep using this because that framing hammer is nowhere near its limits, right? And so I think that there's
[35:16.880 --> 35:18.880]  That's one school of thought that like, you know
[35:19.120 --> 35:23.760]  The ipad is significantly overbuilt for the tasks that most people use it for
[35:24.400 --> 35:27.040]  And then the other school I think the other side of it
[35:27.040 --> 35:31.200]  Is apple has not done as good of a job as it could
[35:31.920 --> 35:37.280]  Explaining to people how much they can do with that framing hammer like they haven't sold it as a framing hammer
[35:37.520 --> 35:39.520]  And so I think that there's definitely some interesting
[35:39.980 --> 35:43.840]  Debates to be had there. I don't even know where I fall, you know on that scale yet
[35:43.840 --> 35:45.600]  I i'm of two minds about it
[35:45.600 --> 35:51.280]  But I think those are the kind of arguments that people are having about where the ipad is currently and then on top of that
[35:51.680 --> 35:55.360]  You have this. Hey, we don't know how long it's gonna be
[35:55.360 --> 35:59.920]  Before people need to or want to replace an ipad that they don't break, right?
[35:59.920 --> 36:04.720]  You know ever since the ipad 2 or 3 or whatever, you know ipad ar I guess you'd say
[36:05.200 --> 36:12.000]  Um, it's been pretty capable. Yeah, so why replace it? Yeah, I think it starts with the ipad
[36:12.640 --> 36:15.120]  Air I feel like up until then
[36:15.760 --> 36:21.040]  It was still improving rapidly. I mean the first one is the first one. I mean, you know, it was
[36:21.040 --> 36:25.200]  You know, wow, it's a tablet that people might actually buy but it was super thick it didn't have retina
[36:25.760 --> 36:28.560]  And then it got thinner and then it got retina
[36:28.560 --> 36:34.800]  but the ipad 3 that had retina actually got thicker than the ipad 2 that was before it and it was replaced by
[36:34.800 --> 36:36.880]  Apple six months after it came out which is
[36:37.680 --> 36:44.160]  Sort of ridiculous in hindsight. It just shows shows how far they were pushing themselves to get that retina ipad 3 out
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.400]  And then I really feel like it found itself with the ipad air where they shrank the software
[36:50.400 --> 36:52.160]  they shrank the size on the sides
[36:52.800 --> 36:56.720]  uh, and it the the a series chips had gotten
[36:57.760 --> 37:02.720]  i'm, sorry about that that that launched siri again on my phone by saying a
[37:04.080 --> 37:10.320]  Series i'm sorry. I apologize to anybody out there. Who's hey siri. Hey dingus was uh,
[37:11.020 --> 37:12.640]  activated
[37:12.640 --> 37:17.120]  but at and I just feel like my my working hypothesis on
[37:17.120 --> 37:24.560]  The weird trajectory of ipad sales weird meaning it, you know at one point was like 20 million a quarter and it was sky
[37:24.560 --> 37:26.560]  It was faster
[37:26.560 --> 37:32.160]  It was never above the iphone, but it was above the iphone at that date since launch
[37:32.800 --> 37:40.480]  like the first ipad outsold the first iphone the second ipad ipad 2 outsold the iphone 3g and
[37:41.280 --> 37:46.720]  You know, and then it came down to earth and my working theory on this is simply like pretty much what you said
[37:46.720 --> 37:48.560]  that it's
[37:48.560 --> 37:53.760]  there was this great unfilled need steve jobs was right that there was this middle territory for
[37:54.480 --> 38:00.240]  Something like an ipad in people's lives and there was nothing like it right the phones were too small
[38:00.960 --> 38:02.560]  and
[38:02.560 --> 38:04.400]  laptops are
[38:04.400 --> 38:10.880]  you know, they are great for certain things, but they're there's they're impersonal enough and the form factor is such that
[38:10.880 --> 38:17.440]  It you know, it creates this void that the ipad actually does fill but then once people got one
[38:17.840 --> 38:23.120]  Especially of the air vintage or later there. That's it. They don't need another one until they you know break the other one
[38:23.840 --> 38:25.040]  Mm-hmm
[38:25.040 --> 38:27.520]  Yeah, I mean if you look at it from the terms of like hey
[38:27.920 --> 38:33.680]  Steve introduces the ipad and says we think people are going to love this people need this and that was if you
[38:33.680 --> 38:40.720]  If you ascribe to the the histories of it the ipad was the goal and the iphone was an ancillary thing that they hit on
[38:41.520 --> 38:43.520]  but if you go to
[38:43.760 --> 38:50.160]  Go back to that and you say you haven't walk on stage and say we think that this is going to be
[38:50.800 --> 38:52.800]  You know in 10 years or whatever
[38:53.360 --> 38:59.360]  What is it now 2010? So seven seven years in seven years? This is going to be a
[38:59.360 --> 39:04.080]  Total of three hundred million dollar business for apple, which is about what ipads are maybe a little more now, right?
[39:05.120 --> 39:11.920]  People would have been like overjoyed right three hundred million dollars, uh, you know that there's three hundred million units
[39:11.920 --> 39:14.400]  Excuse me, right three hundred million dollars significantly more dollars
[39:14.720 --> 39:20.560]  But you know you you you look at the amount total that you sold and these these billions of dollars of
[39:21.120 --> 39:26.400]  You know business that the ipad created you would go. Hey, that's an entire company more than that
[39:26.400 --> 39:32.400]  Entire company's worth of value that you're going to create for apple and shareholders and whatever else that is more
[39:32.800 --> 39:37.200]  That is more than great and it is only because the iphone has been so
[39:37.840 --> 39:39.520]  You know outsized
[39:39.520 --> 39:42.560]  Popular and now we know continues to grow
[39:43.440 --> 39:48.960]  That the ipad looks paltry in comparison like and because I had those go-go early years
[39:49.760 --> 39:53.600]  Yeah, yeah, exactly where it was exactly a real ramp up, you know fastest selling
[39:53.600 --> 39:56.480]  Computer or fastest selling consumer electronics device
[39:57.040 --> 40:01.200]  Um, I think maybe they connect beat it for a time and then it surpassed. I don't know don't quote me
[40:01.200 --> 40:05.440]  But you know one of the fastest anyway, uh selling consumer electronics devices of all time
[40:06.320 --> 40:13.360]  And it just yeah, you look at those boom years and you go. Oh man, you know, it's now it's going down or whatever
[40:13.600 --> 40:19.680]  But you know ipad still they still sold 13 million of those, you know in the last quarter, which is crazy
[40:19.680 --> 40:23.760]  And if yeah, it's still an enormous business and it it is apple's
[40:24.400 --> 40:25.360]  answer
[40:25.360 --> 40:29.360]  To the sub thousand dollar computer market, right?
[40:29.520 --> 40:33.280]  Like let's just admit that the phone is the phone and even apple, you know
[40:33.520 --> 40:38.720]  It's smartphone is the most important device in the computer industry has ever come up with any even apple
[40:38.720 --> 40:44.560]  I think even as much as apple knew with the 10 year ago introduction of the iphone that they had something special on their hands
[40:44.960 --> 40:46.960]  I think that even apple itself
[40:46.960 --> 40:54.400]  Was surprised at just how how useful a smartphone could be and how much we would depend on it as our primary device
[40:56.080 --> 41:02.400]  If you just think of the ipad if if they called it the mac pad instead of ipad and you just counted it with mac sales
[41:02.720 --> 41:08.880]  As pc I don't I don't think that's a ridiculous comparison to make you know that there are people who are going to
[41:09.200 --> 41:12.960]  You know going to go drop five hundred dollars on a portable computer
[41:12.960 --> 41:18.240]  well, they're not going to buy a macbook because there is no system as a five hundred dollar macbook, but they might get an ipad pro or
[41:19.040 --> 41:21.040]  You know an ipad air or whatever
[41:23.760 --> 41:30.480]  If you add up, you know those 13 million, uh, ipad sales to the max five million sales
[41:30.480 --> 41:36.880]  That's 18 million personal computers that apple sold, you know in the whatever price range from ipad to to
[41:37.520 --> 41:39.520]  You know most expensive mac
[41:39.520 --> 41:46.720]  It's pretty impressive, but I do think that it's sort of gonna set. I think it's already settled into sort of a mac-like static
[41:47.440 --> 41:51.200]  number of how many million they can sell a quarter, you know, so the the
[41:52.240 --> 41:55.280]  analogy the cars and trucks analogy where
[41:56.160 --> 41:58.000]  the car's a
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.560]  You know lightweight computer and a truck is a desktop or whatever
[42:03.280 --> 42:04.960]  I mean people often
[42:04.960 --> 42:11.280]  View the ipad as the car and you know, that's and then set the iphone aside, but I think it's interesting to
[42:11.920 --> 42:14.720]  Rejigger that a little bit and view the iphone as the car
[42:15.760 --> 42:18.000]  You know, the iphone's your daily driver
[42:18.560 --> 42:23.040]  Right that you'd name me a day. You don't touch your iphone. It's possible right if you lost it
[42:23.600 --> 42:27.920]  You broke it. You don't touch it other than that you touch it every day. So that's your car
[42:28.720 --> 42:30.720]  The desktop stays the truck, right?
[42:30.720 --> 42:34.320]  So the question then is like is the ipad?
[42:34.880 --> 42:36.880]  your
[42:37.040 --> 42:39.040]  your
[42:39.040 --> 42:42.080]  Utility vehicle or is it your sports car?
[42:42.640 --> 42:47.200]  In other words, do you like take it out on the weekends to get work done or do you take it out on the weekends for?
[42:47.200 --> 42:51.760]  Fun and I think that there's there's whatever the case whatever side of that you come down on
[42:51.760 --> 42:56.400]  I think there's definitely a case to be made for the ipad as like a purpose-driven device
[42:56.400 --> 43:02.480]  That I mean, you know, there are whole companies built up around like revel systems and other things that are built up around using the ipads to
[43:03.120 --> 43:05.120]  to serve functions
[43:05.680 --> 43:06.720]  in
[43:06.720 --> 43:14.400]  the a large portion of its business is driven by institutional sales right like schools and other things that use the ipads
[43:14.880 --> 43:18.320]  in in very specific ways and I think that there's
[43:19.360 --> 43:21.200]  the the netbook or
[43:21.200 --> 43:26.400]  Pina or whatever when you remember the netbook era in schools when everybody was like, oh, we'll just buy netbooks for the kids
[43:26.800 --> 43:31.200]  And those things were just so bad like so bad garbage
[43:31.760 --> 43:34.400]  Yeah, garbage garbage. It was it's a
[43:35.120 --> 43:42.320]  it was very funny to me because uh, I mean my son is now in seventh grade, but as a 13 year old he's sort of
[43:43.840 --> 43:46.480]  Like an interesting age technology wise
[43:46.480 --> 43:50.320]  Because uh, you know when he first started going to school
[43:50.960 --> 43:54.720]  It was you know, it wasn't quite 10 years ago, but you know
[43:55.680 --> 44:02.720]  2008 9 whatever his school had a lot of I don't know if they were called netbooks, but you know effectively they were that's what
[44:02.720 --> 44:08.640]  A lot of the devices they had and all the kids all the kids knew they were junk like the because it and it's so funny
[44:08.640 --> 44:12.640]  To me because I remember when I was a kid getting access to any computer that I had
[44:12.640 --> 44:19.200]  And it's so funny to me because I remember when I was a kid getting access to any computer in school was it was it would
[44:19.520 --> 44:21.520]  It was like all of a sudden i'm poked
[44:22.240 --> 44:25.040]  Just pump full of dopamine and i'm on, you know, yes, right
[44:25.600 --> 44:29.280]  and yes, there were ones that were better than others and newer than others and
[44:29.840 --> 44:32.480]  There were even the some of them some of the classes. I mean it was so
[44:33.120 --> 44:37.140]  Ad hoc at the school elementary school. I went to there were you know, some teachers had like a ti 99
[44:37.140 --> 44:43.300]  4a or whatever it was called which was a total piece of junk. I mean it ran off a literal cassette tape drive
[44:43.700 --> 44:44.820]  But I loved it
[44:44.820 --> 44:48.020]  It was just so funny to me to see like first graders who thought that you know
[44:48.020 --> 44:50.980]  Didn't even want to use the netbooks because they were such pieces of junk
[44:53.460 --> 44:56.660]  Right and they can it's like they can tell if they could tell
[44:57.220 --> 45:02.260]  Everybody could tell and if you look at the ipad that way and you look at it like hey
[45:02.260 --> 45:09.620]  you know, no matter what your I mean, you know, there are some people that can't afford any computer at all and that's that's
[45:09.940 --> 45:11.460]  You know to be
[45:11.460 --> 45:13.300]  That's a different
[45:13.300 --> 45:15.300]  Problem or different discussion to be had right?
[45:15.700 --> 45:20.340]  But if you can afford a computer the almost nearly the first computer you could afford
[45:20.740 --> 45:24.180]  Is either a subsidized iphone or an unsubsidized ipad, right?
[45:24.820 --> 45:26.820]  and I think that if you
[45:26.820 --> 45:33.780]  You could look at like chromebooks and a lot of those other things as sort of those companies efforts to do that to lower the barrier
[45:33.780 --> 45:35.780]  To get somebody to using
[45:36.180 --> 45:41.780]  Their computer slash using the web in google's case using their services and using their connected
[45:42.260 --> 45:46.260]  You know their connected services that that carry advertising and whatever the case may be
[45:47.220 --> 45:53.460]  In apple's case. It's the same thing. It's like we want people to be into the apple ecosystem so we can teach them about how good
[45:53.460 --> 45:59.300]  Apple could be for them and and what you know, what an apple computer feels like versus another computer
[46:00.100 --> 46:06.100]  And I think the ipad is a good ambassador that way and so if it always exists if it levels out at some point
[46:06.500 --> 46:08.660]  Because we we're not we haven't seen any leveling out
[46:08.660 --> 46:11.380]  I think that's the big question marks that everybody is seeing right now
[46:11.700 --> 46:15.780]  because once the the true replacement cycles start to kick in and or
[46:16.340 --> 46:21.300]  You know apple finds a way to revitalize it in some significant way where you know
[46:21.300 --> 46:27.620]  We get a new spike that resets the bar and then it's you know slopes downwards from there as everybody adopts the the new thing
[46:28.260 --> 46:32.500]  Whatever the case may be. I think there will be a point where it eventually levels out
[46:32.980 --> 46:37.380]  And we see what kind of business the ipad business actually is and will be long term
[46:37.780 --> 46:42.180]  and I think that business will always be characterized by its ability to
[46:43.060 --> 46:46.520]  You know give people expanded computing capabilities
[46:46.520 --> 46:52.760]  At far less price than in a macbook. Yeah, and that's that's what it will always be for apple and and apple could preach about
[46:53.160 --> 46:57.800]  You know what? It could be for artists and what it could be for creatives and all this other stuff and that's great
[46:58.280 --> 47:02.280]  And now hopefully they continue to serve those people by pushing the capabilities of the device
[47:02.760 --> 47:08.040]  But the vast majority of sales in the category are not that yeah, you know, there's not 13 million
[47:09.320 --> 47:14.360]  Artists buying it for pencils, you know, it's just not that's not the way it works the the number I
[47:14.360 --> 47:16.040]  The the number I
[47:16.040 --> 47:19.960]  Pointed out. Well, one of the numbers I pointed out was that uh, just looking at revenue
[47:20.920 --> 47:28.040]  Last year ipad was above mac and services by like a little bit for mac and about a billion dollars
[47:28.200 --> 47:35.560]  In revenue for the same quarter last year and as of this year and announced the the numbers announced today the mac
[47:36.280 --> 47:41.260]  Uh did 7.2 billion in revenue and ipad was down to 5.5
[47:41.260 --> 47:45.820]  Uh and services were up from 6 billion to 7.2 billion
[47:46.460 --> 47:47.900]  um
[47:47.900 --> 47:50.220]  Again, i'm not a doom and gloom on ipad
[47:50.220 --> 47:57.420]  But I think it just goes to show how the mix of the the price points that are selling at ipad are are low
[47:58.060 --> 48:01.420]  I think that the you know, and I think the ipad pro is a successful product
[48:01.500 --> 48:06.060]  But I think it's going to be most successful in years to come as it trickles down
[48:06.220 --> 48:09.500]  You know the original ipad pros trickle down to the lower price points
[48:09.500 --> 48:10.700]  uh
[48:10.700 --> 48:12.700]  And I think it's clear since the max
[48:13.260 --> 48:16.860]  like unit sales are just about dead even but the
[48:17.500 --> 48:23.020]  Revenue was up quite a bit that the macbook pros the new ones sold pretty well for the first quarter
[48:23.420 --> 48:25.980]  And I don't even think that that they weren't even out for the whole quarter
[48:27.180 --> 48:28.220]  right
[48:28.220 --> 48:32.620]  Yeah, they weren't and when you look at that trickle down effect, I mean you look at the ipad pro
[48:33.500 --> 48:35.500]  especially the larger one
[48:35.580 --> 48:37.580]  and how much capability I mean
[48:37.580 --> 48:39.740]  it easily at on par
[48:40.760 --> 48:42.780]  utility wise
[48:42.780 --> 48:47.340]  At least in the specific utilities with cintiq, you know
[48:49.100 --> 48:53.260]  Computers from like waycom that were several thousand dollars more
[48:53.900 --> 48:55.660]  and frankly
[48:55.660 --> 48:58.940]  Worse, you know, the the pencil tracking was not nearly
[48:59.500 --> 49:03.760]  What it is on the ipad and the screen does not have the color rendition and accuracy
[49:03.760 --> 49:09.120]  Of the ipad pro and you look at all that and you look at as that trickles down you're going to see those
[49:10.400 --> 49:12.400]  pro devices
[49:12.400 --> 49:14.000]  being
[49:14.000 --> 49:19.040]  giving people access artists and other creatives access to those capabilities in ways that
[49:19.440 --> 49:24.800]  Just were not even heard of and I think apple doesn't get credit for that stuff because people want to see
[49:25.600 --> 49:32.240]  You know in a business and tech writing world people want to see those results in the new numbers and it's like oh every
[49:32.240 --> 49:38.240]  Every everybody must buy that ipad pro and really drive up the sales and price and stuff every quarter
[49:38.480 --> 49:42.320]  Whereas if you look at it in the arc of the game where it's like hey
[49:43.040 --> 49:45.040]  We're shipping this now in
[49:45.360 --> 49:49.520]  In a year, it's going to be really affordable and we're going to sell a lot more of them
[49:49.760 --> 49:53.200]  Or a lot more of devices that have their capability whatever they're going to call them
[49:53.840 --> 49:58.720]  Uh, and that that arc I think is a very interesting one and it's hard to message
[49:59.280 --> 50:01.280]  Right because people don't want to hear
[50:01.280 --> 50:06.800]  Uh, we're we're putting this thing out that not a lot of people are going to buy but more people will buy later when it's affordable
[50:06.800 --> 50:10.720]  They want to hear or we're putting this thing out that people must buy now. Yeah. Yeah, you know
[50:11.760 --> 50:13.040]  Right
[50:13.040 --> 50:18.320]  Like anything short of an ipad that makes everybody just throw their old ipad in the garbage and go
[50:18.720 --> 50:22.640]  Get in line to buy the new one is somehow a failure, but it doesn't really work that way
[50:23.280 --> 50:29.040]  The only other thing I have from the uh results and from the the notes of the conference call that I read
[50:29.040 --> 50:34.880]  Was that tim cook pointed out that apple pay users are up three three x year over year
[50:35.360 --> 50:42.320]  So that's a really it was a that's that's a very good year for apple pay especially since it's what two years old now
[50:42.400 --> 50:43.840]  Two and a half years old
[50:43.840 --> 50:45.520]  Mm-hmm
[50:45.520 --> 50:48.960]  And again, that's the other thing I had in my notes that is sort of like hey
[50:48.960 --> 50:52.000]  Let's all remember that that getting people to do something
[50:53.600 --> 50:55.280]  to to like
[50:55.280 --> 51:02.720]  To like 2013 years. Hey, you're gonna pay for stuff by putting your fingerprint on a phone at the register on your cell phone
[51:03.280 --> 51:07.280]  Uh, right sounds weird, right? It's like different and it's like, I don't know. I mean
[51:08.480 --> 51:15.520]  I I know enough about how it works. I understand it that it's I actually understand that it's actually more secure than using a credit card
[51:15.680 --> 51:19.120]  A lot more secure it you know, if you're doing a magnetic swipe
[51:19.120 --> 51:24.720]  But you know people always have the heebie-jeebies about putting their credit card into their phone or something like that
[51:24.720 --> 51:26.720]  I mean there were a lot of an awful lot of people
[51:27.120 --> 51:33.360]  Who spent years not buying anything at all on the web because they didn't feel like they could trust it because it was new and different
[51:33.600 --> 51:39.600]  And that's just the way humans are hooked up for the most part that new and different is scary and therefore you wait
[51:41.120 --> 51:47.120]  So 3x growth in apple pay I guess I I didn't see the details on where exactly that is like how much it's going to be
[51:47.120 --> 51:49.760]  In the u.s. How much of it is worldwide expansion?
[51:50.960 --> 51:57.360]  But I feel it's one of those stories that in terms of hey apple hasn't done a goddamn thing under tim cook that that crowd
[51:58.880 --> 52:05.760]  Conveniently overlooks that it's a that's a really solid tim cook apple era success story
[52:07.600 --> 52:14.400]  Yeah, I mean changing user behavior on something that has to do with their wallet, you know their bank account or whatever that's insanely hard
[52:14.400 --> 52:18.400]  It's insanely hard. And so it is it is encouraging to see things like that that
[52:19.120 --> 52:25.920]  Theoretically, you know could be big bets. I mean, you know when people had the inkling that they were going to get into payments
[52:26.480 --> 52:29.200]  You know people saw that as a as a very big business for them
[52:29.200 --> 52:30.880]  And I think it's still you know
[52:30.880 --> 52:35.520]  It already is some somewhat of a business another services category and could be a much larger business
[52:36.400 --> 52:42.800]  In the future, especially if you know, apple's able to sell apple pay through and it's not
[52:42.800 --> 52:45.760]  going to sell apple pay through and keep up this kind of growth
[52:46.640 --> 52:48.400]  but I mean it's
[52:48.400 --> 52:50.400]  The hurdles you have to overcome
[52:50.560 --> 52:53.760]  When you're switching over to something like apple pay are crazy
[52:53.920 --> 52:55.520]  Yeah, I mean you got you know
[52:55.520 --> 52:58.320]  You come to the counter and you're going to pay with your phone
[52:58.720 --> 53:01.680]  And you're not quite sure where to put it and you're not you know
[53:01.920 --> 53:04.800]  How far away and what part of this credit card?
[53:04.960 --> 53:07.920]  So I put it where the credit card goes do I put it over the keypad?
[53:07.920 --> 53:10.320]  Do I put it over some weird symbol that i'm not familiar with?
[53:10.320 --> 53:15.360]  Do I put it on this clear plastic part, you know, and people are embarrassed. They don't want to do that
[53:15.680 --> 53:19.200]  First of all, there are people behind them. Yeah, it's still so early days
[53:20.160 --> 53:23.680]  it's still so early days that usually like when I go to like a place that
[53:24.160 --> 53:27.380]  Like I notice that they've upgraded their point of sale systems
[53:27.760 --> 53:31.440]  And I either see the apple pay logo or I see that little wi-fi looking logo
[53:31.520 --> 53:35.600]  That means it usually works apple pay usually works even if they're not officially
[53:36.240 --> 53:39.680]  Apple pay yet, you know that it just has contactless, you know, uh
[53:39.680 --> 53:41.680]  uh nfc payments
[53:41.680 --> 53:43.760]  Um, the clerk usually has no idea, you know
[53:43.760 --> 53:47.760]  I'll say like there'll be like how you're gonna pay and i'll say i'm gonna try apple pay and they'll say what's that?
[53:48.240 --> 53:51.840]  I mean i've had that happen and it i'm not afraid to do it because I know
[53:52.560 --> 53:56.560]  You know, uh, i'm a i'm not embarrassed even if it doesn't work and be
[53:57.440 --> 54:01.520]  You know, I i'm not embarrassed that I might know more about how this works than the clerk
[54:01.520 --> 54:04.480]  But somebody has to go first and people are resistant to stuff like that
[54:05.440 --> 54:06.880]  Here's a funny thing. This is true
[54:06.880 --> 54:10.640]  I think I forget if i've mentioned this on the show before now, but one of the places I go
[54:11.040 --> 54:16.160]  that just added a new point of sale system that that supports apple pay are the uh,
[54:17.520 --> 54:23.780]  The state-run liquor stores here in in pennsylvania, um, and theirs very consistently
[54:28.080 --> 54:33.440]  Doesn't work on the first try every single time I put my phone there. I have my thumb on the sensor
[54:33.440 --> 54:36.480]  And it says card not valid
[54:36.560 --> 54:39.760]  Or something something's not valid use card instead
[54:40.080 --> 54:44.800]  But if I just sit there and lift my thumb and press it again, it goes ding and then I get the payment
[54:45.440 --> 54:47.200]  But how many people would even think to try that?
[54:47.920 --> 54:51.760]  Like did and every time every single time I do it you right?
[54:53.760 --> 54:57.280]  I just looked at the error message and I thought well that that error message makes no sense
[54:57.280 --> 55:00.880]  So i'm just going to try again. I you know didn't ask the clerk for help or anything
[55:00.880 --> 55:06.160]  I just sat there. I just moved the phone away moved it back and now every time I do it. It gets it's the same thing
[55:08.240 --> 55:12.400]  Uh anything else on that kind of finickyness doesn't doesn't translate well, yeah
[55:13.360 --> 55:18.240]  Anything else on earnings before we move? Uh, nothing ahead. All right, uh, let me take a break then
[55:18.960 --> 55:23.840]  And thank our next sponsor. It's our good friends longtime sponsor of the show
[55:24.540 --> 55:25.920]  audible
[55:25.920 --> 55:27.920]  uh audible
[55:28.320 --> 55:30.320]  is
[55:30.320 --> 55:33.920]  The unmatched selection of audio content
[55:34.480 --> 55:38.660]  Everybody thinks of them. I always do I do I think of them as the place you go for audiobooks
[55:39.120 --> 55:44.320]  Uh, and they are the number one source in the world for audiobooks
[55:44.480 --> 55:51.520]  But they really have expanded to just audio in general. They have their own audio shows news
[55:52.060 --> 55:53.200]  comedy
[55:53.200 --> 55:58.260]  Uh all sorts of stuff you get a membership you go there you can number one if you go to audible.com

[56:14.900 --> 56:20.500]  So even if you have like an old ipod that used to use like to work out at the gym or something like that
[56:20.900 --> 56:24.340]  Uh, it doesn't have to be like a smartphone. You don't need like a special app
[56:24.340 --> 56:28.980]  you can just download the stuff to your uh mac and sync it over to an old ipad or
[56:29.540 --> 56:33.380]  Ipod or kindle or anything like that that can play audio and it'll work

[57:07.140 --> 57:10.980]  Here's some news and it's interesting it's follow-up from last week's show
[57:11.060 --> 57:16.340]  I had ben thompson on and I mentioned an anecdote from a reader of the show and I was a little nervous bringing it up
[57:16.420 --> 57:18.420]  Because it was like one
[57:18.420 --> 57:22.420]  Uh reader who wrote me this email, but he convinced me
[57:23.140 --> 57:25.700]  He it really seemed like he knew what he was talking about
[57:25.780 --> 57:29.060]  Like it wasn't just like he wasn't just spitting in the wind
[57:29.380 --> 57:36.100]  But he bought the new lg ultrafine 5k display the one that that apple like sort of co-developed and it's the only
[57:36.740 --> 57:41.060]  Retina standalone display you can get from apple right now is this these lg models?
[57:41.540 --> 57:42.660]  um
[57:42.660 --> 57:44.660]  And he was having all sorts of problems with it
[57:44.660 --> 57:48.180]  And for some reason it occurred to him to try moving it and he did
[57:48.740 --> 57:54.100]  And it turns out that moving it away from his wi-fi router solved the problems and I had to mention this on the show with
[57:54.100 --> 57:55.460]  Ben thompson
[57:55.460 --> 57:57.460]  well, uh
[57:57.540 --> 57:59.540]  It seems like this is an actual thing
[58:00.100 --> 58:06.100]  Zach hall wrote a story at nine to five mac person first hand story where the exact same thing happened with him
[58:06.740 --> 58:12.100]  Where he and and the problem was so bad. It was like actually crashing his macbook
[58:12.100 --> 58:14.660]  He has his macbook hooked up to the 5k display
[58:15.380 --> 58:21.220]  And it was like freezing his his macbook. He googled a little bit saw some
[58:22.500 --> 58:27.460]  Other people speculating about this. Hey, it's near a wi-fi router. His was near his wi-fi router
[58:27.460 --> 58:32.980]  So he moved it to a different moved it away from from his desk and the problems all went away
[58:33.060 --> 58:37.460]  And then he contacted lg and lg said yeah, just don't use it near a wi-fi router
[58:37.460 --> 58:44.100]  This is crazy. Well, I mean, why would a computer ever be near a wi-fi router?
[58:46.820 --> 58:54.660]  I can't help but think especially in a home office. It's got to be a frequent a common scenario, you know, and anybody, you know
[58:54.660 --> 59:00.100]  Yeah, probably, uh anybody who's like lives in like a studio apartment or something like that?
[59:00.100 --> 59:02.900]  I mean you may not even be able to move it that far away, you know
[59:03.540 --> 59:05.540]  It's kind of crazy
[59:05.540 --> 59:08.340]  And it just yeah, it's insane. Um, yeah
[59:09.140 --> 59:14.580]  I mean the gist I guess we I guess we know how exactly how closely co-developed it was now
[59:16.980 --> 59:21.780]  The the gist of this display I do not have one I have a iMac here so i'm not
[59:22.580 --> 59:27.060]  5k iMac so i'm not in the market for a standalone display, but I saw i've seen them in the apple stores
[59:27.060 --> 59:30.820]  I saw them at the apple event that you and I were at a couple months ago
[59:30.820 --> 59:38.260]  And my impression my first-hand impression of just looking at it, you know from a kick the tires perspective was it's a gorgeous display
[59:39.300 --> 59:41.300]  In a really chintzy
[59:41.620 --> 59:43.620]  but at least
[59:43.620 --> 59:48.660]  Plain looking case it doesn't it's not an ugly. I don't think they're ugly, but they're not really it's not
[59:49.540 --> 59:56.020]  Yeah, yeah, it's not sexy like an apple product is so I could really like wow that is I want that that is gorgeous
[59:56.020 --> 59:58.020]  Even before easy, but the display quality is excellent
[59:58.020 --> 01:00:05.460]  Um, and the convenience of just being able to plug in USB-C thunderbolt and just have it work seems really great and
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:09.700]  But like you said it seems pretty clear that the collaboration with apple was
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:13.220]  Not on the enclosure
[01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:21.300]  So the chin the chin, oh, yeah, not on the shielding the chintzy feeling and looking enclosure is also
[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:24.260]  chintzly shielded and and
[01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:29.860]  Right. I'm not an expert on shielding, but it seems to me like this is just emblematic of why
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:38.660]  There's a practical reason beyond just wanting to spend more more money that that a lot of us wish apple were making its own
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:40.740]  apple branded 5k displays
[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:50.100]  Yeah, I mean the answers that I got with this stuff when I poked around, you know, like why the heck not, you know,
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:53.940]  Is it's it's pretty much as hard as designing an entire system
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:58.260]  So why do it and and it's like, you know, we're not why do it
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:01.940]  I think that's it's like not that attitude that I got like who cares it was more
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:06.660]  We have so many hours in the day and this is like designing a new iMac
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:12.100]  So maybe we shouldn't do it this time, you know, and maybe we should put our efforts elsewhere
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:16.180]  And I mean you could disagree or agree. I'm not I'm not a serious person
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:20.820]  I'm not saying yay or nay to their POV, but that's the that's the input that I got
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:24.820]  And that's not through official channels or anything. So this is not like a PR message
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:28.500]  It's just a matter of like it's really hard to build that
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:34.500]  Especially because of the the throughput, you know that you have to have to connect it to external displays
[01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:40.180]  And if they wanted to do it the way that they wanted to do it normally which probably would have worked close to a wi-fi router
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.660]  It would have taken them a long time to do it
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:48.180]  It probably would have worked close to a wi-fi router. It would have taken them a lot of time and money and manpower
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:52.660]  To achieve I guess the money money is not really the problem. It's more the time and manpower
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:56.340]  You know taking somebody off of max or
[01:01:56.900 --> 01:02:01.460]  Of another department to work on on that or hiring people in and then trading them up
[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:05.780]  through apple university and blah blah blah to get you know to a point where they are
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:08.820]  Able to work on those hardware products
[01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:14.580]  Um, just they just felt they couldn't devote the time to it. I guess I don't know. It's you know, it's a hard one
[01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:17.380]  You know whether you want to
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:20.180]  fault them or not, uh
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:23.300]  I don't know and obviously some people do but
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:30.820]  For this for which is that they have so much money. How can this how can they possibly be stretched thin on resources?
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:35.540]  Now whether that's an actual emblematic of a problem in their mindset
[01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:40.020]  That they're still at an executive level think too much like the small company smaller company
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:43.940]  They used to be pre iphone or whether it's actually bad management
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:48.100]  I don't know but it's obvious though that they are
[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:53.780]  Whether they whether that's reasonable and that's a sign that they you know that for apple to be apple
[01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.180]  That you know, like maybe the the pro
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:58.660]  Argument would be for apple to be apple
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:03.620]  they have to continue to to be like a small company that focuses on a few things because
[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:05.380]  That's just how that's how it works
[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:12.900]  The con argument would be you know, it's just ridiculous that they can't afford to put an engineering team together to do a display
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:18.180]  But it's it it the proof, you know, whether it should be this way or not
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:22.260]  They are they're stretched thin and I think that the decision not to do this
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:27.780]  It it's exactly along those lines that if we if it's going to take us that much effort to do this
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:29.780]  We we put that effort somewhere else
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:37.780]  Right, yes, and you you could hammer all day on the argument that well they should be able to afford the man hours or whatever the case
[01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:42.820]  But yeah, that's the way it came down and that's why these decisions were made the way they are as far as I know
[01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:44.820]  I don't know. You know, maybe i'm wrong, but
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:47.460]  I think you
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:51.220]  You reach a point where saying no becomes less about
[01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:55.220]  Oh, we're not going to pursue this new fun thing
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:59.700]  and sometimes it comes down to we're not going to
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:06.100]  Splinter ourselves in ways that make a lot of logical sense
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:11.140]  Like it's much harder to say no to the things that makes make a ton of sense
[01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:17.380]  Than it is to say no to the things that have very obvious faults and flaws and and whatever, you know
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:20.980]  I mean so many unknowns in a project can lead you to say no
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:27.700]  So many things that say hey, you know, we're we're down this pathway. We've spent a lot of money and whatever
[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:33.300]  Those could be hard to say no to but the ones that make total sense like why wouldn't apple make an external display?
[01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:38.980]  Those are the ones that you're going to take the most heat over. Those are the ones that you're going to hopefully
[01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:41.620]  Have to really come to
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:47.220]  Have a come to jesus moment on and say we're not making them for these results
[01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:52.100]  They make a lot of sense to us and that we can't even message or or you know
[01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:54.980]  Don't want to message externally for whatever reason
[01:04:56.660 --> 01:05:01.060]  If it is simply that they can't they don't have enough people to work on it
[01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:05.460]  Man, you know, it's it's hard. It's that's a hard thing to defend but
[01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:09.220]  If they don't have them they don't have them right? What are you gonna do?
[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:13.300]  Like you can't just hire a whole new random team full of random people
[01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:18.820]  To work on a high-profile hardware release because you're going to have the same problem as the lg thing has
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:22.580]  So it's going to have some weird dumb issue. I mean as hard as apple works on their stuff
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:27.940]  There's always some weird dumb issue when they launch something right because this stuff is difficult and it's very complex
[01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:30.580]  So if you're not going to own that
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:34.820]  And own whatever problems you come you can't say oh we put our b team on this
[01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:39.780]  Right, or we put the noobs on it. You just got to say no. I'm going to say no
[01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:45.620]  Right, or we put the noobs on it. You just got to say no. I wouldn't be surprised if apple
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:50.900]  Doesn't do a standalone display or to you know, 4k and 5k
[01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:57.780]  I I I don't know. I don't have any kind of like little birdie info that yes, they're coming
[01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:04.980]  Uh, I have had little birdie info and other people have too that that there were apple branded displays in the works within apple
[01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:09.460]  Um whether they're still moving forward. I have not heard anything. I don't know
[01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:14.020]  So I don't have I can't even whisper a secret on the show and say i've heard it
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:16.820]  but I know that there were and
[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.940]  I I wouldn't be surprised
[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:26.500]  If the story is I mean the one everybody seems to believe right now is apple is out of the standalone display game period
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:32.580]  And we're never going to have another one possible. I would not be surprised if there never is another standalone display
[01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:34.340]  um
[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:40.180]  Other than you know treating the iMac buying an iMac just to use as a standalone display with with target display mode
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:44.340]  Which is kind of ridiculous the idea that you'd buy a computer you wouldn't use
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:46.580]  but
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:48.580]  It does work
[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:53.780]  It does also beg the question how expensive is the display versus the other components in the device
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:57.300]  so if your 5k display had to be
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:04.820]  60 as expensive as a regular iMac that's on the bubble if it's 70 as expensive right who the hell's gonna buy it
[01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:08.820]  Right, you know, so there's also that you know component cost
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:16.420]  Angle that you gotta think about I wouldn't be surprised though if the story is simply and again on this theme of apple
[01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:21.300]  can only do so much at a time and there's only so many resources for testing and for
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:28.740]  And for even just stuff like sales and training the the entire retail staff on product design and stuff like that
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:30.500]  um
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.900]  I wouldn't be surprised if they're still in the works
[01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:38.520]  But it was so clear that it wasn't going to be done in time for october 2016
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:46.280]  When they needed to have something to sell with the new macbook pros they needed some sort of retina display
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:51.480]  That would work with usb-c and thunderbolt 3. Um
[01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.280]  That they couldn't get that done in time
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:57.720]  The lg could slap something together
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:04.360]  And so that's what they did and I in that maybe but it won't I think maybe it won't come out till like a year
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:11.560]  You know like next year like next october, you know october 2017 a year later. Here's the new apple whatever they're gonna call it
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:18.120]  You know 5k display right and it doesn't it'll be hard to think that they this would be their ambassador forever, right?
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:20.840]  Uh, it's really hard. I know that uh
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:30.040]  You know like it's a it's a sounds funny, but I know john syracuse has made this point on atp several times
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:35.720]  They're going to make this brand new campus. It's going to be you know, it's all johnny. I've approved hallways and
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:41.160]  hallways and curved glass and lighting fixtures and desks
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:41.880]  He's just you know
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:46.680]  They're designing their own tables and all of this and what are they going to do fill them with lg displays?
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.160]  on the engineer's desks
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.560]  It just seems ridiculous
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:56.280]  I mean for everybody who doesn't have a john syracuse thing, right? It's really funny, but it it does
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:57.800]  so
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:05.080]  I other than nilay patel nilay is the one who based on like his off the record briefing at the event said apple
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:07.000]  Said they're out of the game
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.440]  I was told a little bit more like what you heard which is
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:16.600]  What I asked I was like, hey does this say I just I asked in a briefing like hey, is this lg display?
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:20.120]  Does that mean you're not going to make a standalone display? And of course, I did not get an answer
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:23.880]  A masterful completely prepared they were
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:29.640]  Obviously rehearsed on the point. Yeah did not get a yes or no, but I got this is the display
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:36.280]  We have to show you you know, what we're selling now is the display that will be in our stores. Uh, that will have you know
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:39.160]  Hooked up in a prominent space in all of our retail stores
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.080]  so make of that what you will and
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:47.800]  That making a standalone display and today with all this stuff is as complicated as making like a new iMac or something like that
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:52.280]  Um that to me doesn't say never it but it does say to me
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:52.840]  Yes
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:57.000]  You can buy the lg display now if you need a new display
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.920]  And we're not going to come out with one in a couple of weeks or a couple of months
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.720]  I think it honestly what it comes down to is if it makes sense
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:08.040]  Then they will and if they it makes a lot of sense to me, that's all I know
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:10.280]  You know that they would do it one day
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:15.480]  Um, but that that day wasn't now and that they needed something to ship. I think you're totally right on that
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:15.720]  Yeah
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:17.720]  it also seems to me like in terms of
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:20.440]  Allocating engineering and testing and all the other stuff for it
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:24.680]  It seems to me like the sort of thing that they could get a lot of years out of because they have in the past
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:29.400]  Where they've come out with new when they call them cinema displays or whatever the other product names were
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:30.840]  They sold them, you know
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:33.980]  They'd come out with a new one and it would be great and maybe price competitive
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:37.080]  with other companies based on the technology of the day and then they
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:43.640]  Apple just keep selling them at 999 as the years go on and monitors from dell and other companies, you know
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.120]  improve or drop in price
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:51.880]  And apple can keep selling it because it's apple and people like to buy the apple branded one and they'll pay a premium for
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:57.960]  it, even if it's you know, a couple of years old it just seems to me that they're they're at a place with these displays where
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:00.200]  The the you know
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:02.200]  You don't need more pixels per inch
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:08.760]  They're super bright. They've they've got amazing color. They've gotten to the wide color gamut. Um that it you know
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:16.200]  If apple came out with I think I could see that they come out with one and sell it unchanged for three four five years
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:20.360]  Right three is probably
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.360]  5k is like
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:25.160]  Yeah, five keys. It's getting close to paper resolution
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:30.600]  I mean, you know or even above if you count color rendition. Yeah, and so it's it's just there's not really a
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.560]  There's no not a lot of places to go from there
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:39.720]  So if they make something that could they could squeeze a many many years out of it and really what would change would be
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:45.640]  You know if there's another major change in in input or output. Yeah, I think that it's sort of a connector or whatever
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:48.760]  yeah, I think that the display itself is least likely to be the
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.200]  the
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:54.520]  We need to we need something to replace it. It's more likely to be the the connector
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:12:00.520]  Um, yeah, it's like oh, I can't believe this display doesn't have usb-8, you know that kind of thing
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:11.000]  Let me take one final break here and thank our third and final sponsor long time friend of the show
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:18.200]  Maybe the longest running sponsor squarespace squarespace is the best place to go to build a new
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.200]  website
[01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:23.020]  It's it's just an amazing product
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:28.780]  Uh, I can't say enough good things about it. I mentioned Syracuse. I'll steal a talking point from Marco Arment
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:33.100]  I love this. I love this idea, which is hey, you're a nerd you're listening to the talk show
[01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:37.740]  You might need a website yourself. And if so, you should definitely look at squarespace. You really should it is amazing
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:40.300]  But here's the bigger thing. It's such a great idea
[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:46.460]  You probably know someone at some point this year. Somebody you know is going to come to you and say that they need a website
[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:49.900]  maybe it's like a school group at your kid's school or
[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:56.140]  like some kind of community group or a church or something that you're involved with and you're like
[01:12:56.220 --> 01:13:01.340]  Everybody knows you're the tech person. You're the you're the nerd and they're gonna come to you with help on this
[01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:08.140]  Set them up with squarespace go to squarespace to get their site going because a it is a great service that you might consider using
[01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:12.960]  Anyway, but be because it's so easy to use and because squarespace offers
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:17.680]  Award-winning tech support that you can get right on the phone if they do have a problem
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:21.480]  They're gonna go to squarespace and not go to you so you can like wash your hands of the problem
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:24.180]  You'll give them a great website. They'll get a great price
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:29.920]  And you'll be done. You won't be on the hook for like when they need to add something or change it or whatever
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:34.240]  They can just do it themselves. It is a great idea and a great a great point
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:36.240]  I think for the audience of a show like this
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:39.060]  So make your next move with squarespace
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:46.500]  Go to squarespace calm and enter the code talk show know the just talk show and you will get 10% off at
[01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:53.680]  Checkout it's a great great service. Keep in mind next time. You need a website or next time anybody, you know needs a website
[01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:56.700]  Remember that code to talk show?
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:03.260]  Here we go deep breath, I wish I had a stiff drink, but instead I've just got fizzy water
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:08.460]  I can't we can't I can't I can't keep going
[01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:14.620]  I can't do this without mentioning Trump's immigration order that came down last week and Silicon Valley's responses
[01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:19.420]  And even if you wanted, you know play the let's you know not talk about politics. It's way too
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:25.820]  Essential to the racket that we cover it really it hits home. I mean, it's a huge deal and
[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:28.660]  I
[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:36.080]  Don't die. I I think it's hard to hard to overstate how how much of a reaction it's already gotten from
[01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:38.900]  companies like Apple and Google and
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:41.660]  Etc. I
[01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:43.980]  Saw Google had a big rally
[01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:47.460]  That's right employees did yeah
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:50.860]  Yeah, you know I'd
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.960]  We I've gotten so much hate mail over this John
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:15:02.120]  You know, we we cover politics and we cover the policies that affect tech and we always have you know
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:04.120]  we have for many years, but
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:08.300]  We've been covering so much more of it lately because so much more has been happening
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:13.200]  that's related to our you know, our industry that we cover and and
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:16.960]  You know there are
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:24.640]  The companies that look to us for whatever reactions or whatever context that they they want to have and we
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:25.320]  You know
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:31.800]  we've been writing about a significant amount of these things as they relate to individual companies and then also get like tech leaders speaking out and
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:37.440]  And taking you know stances one way or another pro and con and well very little pro
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:44.000]  But how far con is a good question about you know, how many of them have responded and I just get I mean
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.840]  I've gotten hate mail, you know
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:51.120]  I mean, I always game Oh, but again, you know, I've gotten a lot over this and there's people are like
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:53.120]  Why are you talking about politics? I don't come to you for that
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.240]  You know people accusing us of being partisan in one direction or another depending on what the art
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:02.720]  You know what article gets published and all this stuff and you know, I just ignore most of it
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:06.160]  I may may end up saying something about it at some point
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:12.280]  But the long and short of it is is that this is not a tech issue. It's not a politics issue
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:17.600]  It's like a human issue. Yeah, like if you're a human you should be interested in this stuff and
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:23.960]  To be fair to our readers. Like I'm I'm not instructing our writers and our writers are not doing it
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:27.320]  They're not writing about stuff from a pure politics standpoint
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:31.680]  We're not politico like we're not just going like hey politics happen and look at politics, you know
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:33.800]  We're definitely relating it to our industry
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:40.720]  But the tech I mean the stuff that he's that he's talking about with immigration and you know possible
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:42.200]  reduction
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:48.360]  Or or cramping and clamping down on h1b visas which allow highly skilled tech workers to come over here
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:55.000]  Those are incredibly germane to the tech industry from everybody from Apple to Google to to Facebook and everybody else
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:57.600]  Uses an enormous amount of h1b workers
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:02.560]  Because there are a lot of highly skilled programmers that come from India
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:07.320]  elsewhere in Asia and and you know a wide variety of other countries that
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:11.160]  Don't that aren't here because our education system has a lot of flaws
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:17.160]  So it's a incredibly germane issue and they're you know, they're up in arms about it or you know
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:21.380]  Up in some kind of arms depending on how closely they're colluding with the current administration
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:28.120]  Yeah, and you know and they're doing the right thing where they you know, they've all these big companies, you know
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:30.120]  the Google's apples Microsoft's
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:35.560]  It's inevitable with the head counts that they have that they have hundreds of employees who are affected by this
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:41.440]  you know that that somewhere along the chain of their passport that they you know, have a
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:47.280]  You know were born in or were once or still are a citizen of one of these seven countries
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:50.160]  And you know
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:55.200]  Might literally be out of the country right now, you know in a way that this was implemented with I just signed it
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:18:02.200]  and it's even if you're in the air right now your your band is you know, it's great that the companies have their employees backs and
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.200]  are helping them but
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:08.600]  It's interesting. I don't know. I don't and and I thought it was you know, I
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:14.720]  Thought Tim Cook's statement could have been a little stronger like I'm not expecting him to
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:17.520]  lash out and
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:21.440]  You know, I'm obviously, you know, it's no secret that I am violently
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:26.040]  Violently against Trump and I see him as a danger and a menace
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:33.720]  Personally, but even so I totally get that Tim Cook or the CEO anybody in a position like that can't be
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:41.200]  even though I would certainly suspect privately that he is based on everything we know about him and who his personal heroes are I
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:47.000]  Get it and and you know, and I see people on Twitter who are you know?
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:51.640]  Who want him to be you know, like a completely outspoken critic?
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:54.720]  I see how he can't but I still think his statement could have been a little bit stronger
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:58.640]  and and in terms of it's like the old adage that like when you're
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  You know collaborating with people that you work with or you're in school and you're doing a crit
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:09.620]  You criticize the work not the person so I don't expect him to come out strongly against Trump personally
[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:12.720]  but I've I think he could have come out a little stronger against the
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:16.040]  the executive order on immigration
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.800]  Yeah, and you've got you've got a variety of people
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:25.000]  It was interesting one here
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:32.600]  here's like a little inside not super inside baseball but inside baseball in a way if you look at the statements that were released there was
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.040]  like
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:37.480]  especially early on there was only a couple of people that went on the record and
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:39.880]  Just said stuff said hey
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:44.300]  This is me and here's the thought I have to say about it and there were a lot of leaked memos
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:49.260]  Even Tim Cook's was not a public statement. It was a quote-unquote leaked memo, right?
[01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:52.900]  You know a couple of publications got it. We ended up getting it
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:20:00.560]  You know the the origin of those memos is often, you know, debated among various journalists
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:04.220]  Hey, did you get this? Where did you get this and we were like, you know sawed off, you know
[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:05.620]  I'm not gonna tell you but
[01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:12.020]  Where that where those come from is an interesting thing because a leaked memo is essentially we want to say this
[01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:16.620]  but we don't want to make a public statement about it because we're a public company and this has a lot of ramifications and
[01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:18.740]  a
[01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:26.180]  Statement and on the record statement is a I feel very strongly personally about this come at me bro, right? And that is a
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:30.180]  there's a difference right in impact I feel and
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:35.180]  eventually a lot of the CEOs a lot of the tech companies ended up having a
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:40.720]  You know some sort of public personal statement about it, you know Satya Nadella posted on LinkedIn
[01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:43.860]  you know the
[01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:46.460]  Mark Zuckerberg posted on Facebook
[01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:49.060]  You know so on and so forth and those those
[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:55.380]  Statements, I mean Sergey Brin showed up at the protest the SFO and he said, you know, this is not a not a company thing
[01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:58.540]  I'm here as an immigrant as a person but then of course the employee
[01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:04.060]  rally and then you know, Google was supportive of that, you know about about the
[01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:08.540]  The ban or whatever you want to call the order, right?
[01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:11.220]  Semantics are being debated as we speak
[01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.540]  but that
[01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:18.740]  That wasn't interesting to me to view the spectrum of people who work were at least
[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:20.860]  I don't know if you want to call it comfortable
[01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:25.020]  but felt passionately enough about it to put it on the record in their own voice and
[01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:30.020]  Go out there versus the people who weren't and it you could it could spell caution. It could spell
[01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:34.980]  Calculation, you know, there are a lot of ways to take it. It just depends on how you look at it. Yeah
[01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:38.980]  One weekend I
[01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:42.660]  Know it is honestly, you know
[01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:47.060]  Yeah there. I mean, there's a lot here that doesn't really feel
[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:54.960]  There's a lot of it here that seems to very clearly to be coming from Steve Bannon, yeah, you know Bannon's
[01:21:56.660 --> 01:21:58.260]  Tenure at Breitbart
[01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:04.900]  And the publications bent it's very clear that these are all things that he feels very strongly personally about
[01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:08.300]  How much of those feelings that Trump shares will be a very interesting?
[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:12.980]  Historical account to read right if we ever figure that out, you know
[01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:18.140]  How closely their views are aligned or if Bannon is able to just you know
[01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:22.060]  Push forth his views and make them Trump's views
[01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:25.780]  But it seems very clear that these attitudes towards immigration
[01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:33.020]  And towards a variety of other government institutions very strongly held by Bannon and this rapid
[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:41.180]  Application of the executive order which Republicans were so angry that Obama utilized
[01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:44.380]  Even though you utilize them far less than say Reagan or someone else
[01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:47.620]  you know he
[01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:54.460]  It is very interesting to see what the ramifications of this very fast and loosed application of this
[01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:56.820]  these orders that obviously had
[01:22:57.860 --> 01:22:59.980]  Far less. Let's put it this way wait
[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:06.180]  It's very clear they had far less vetting from the appropriate agencies than previous executive orders
[01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:10.500]  Right, you know from the agents affected agencies or agencies responsible for their execution
[01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:13.540]  So and this is not a politics thing
[01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:19.500]  This is like a logistics thing or or if you're looking at the government as a business which Trump has said he does
[01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:25.600]  It's very interesting to see this kind of business being conducted and what the ramifications of it will be
[01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:28.820]  Given that we are a weekend and we're already exhausted
[01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:33.700]  It is definitely going to be interesting to see how people maintain their
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:40.580]  Vigilance that these things are handled according to the rule of law and according to appropriate procedure and process
[01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:47.200]  Because fugue is a real thing, you know, I mean or fatigue. There's a real thing, you know, you just
[01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:51.760]  Something you can't keep up. It's so fatiguing that you've mispronounced it. I
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:56.460]  Thought one of the most telling we're inundate and there's so much good writing that's going on
[01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:59.540]  It's hard to keep up with all of it. But one of the most telling things I did
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:02.020]  I actually noted this back in the campaign
[01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:06.460]  I remember this but there were a couple of you know when it was clear that the Steve Bannon was going to be so
[01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:12.980]  Or was so influential in his campaign and then after the election when he we found out that the sky won
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:15.080]  That he was going to be a top advisor
[01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:19.460]  Trump had been a guest on Bannon's radio show
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:24.160]  guess it's not a podcast that gets on some kind of actual radio network, but
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:30.300]  Bannon had a show and one of the times that Trump was on they talked about
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:35.040]  They were talking about immigration and Trump was this is where they differed where Trump was
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:38.640]  arguing more or less that he wanted to make it easier for
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:40.560]  when
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:43.560]  immigrants come and go to our universities and
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:47.040]  Become experts in science or whatever other fields
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:52.400]  They are that it would be better for the country to figure out a way to keep them here with their newly found US
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:57.680]  Edge, you know expertise than to have them leave again and Bannon, you know
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:00.640]  He's like you agree with that right and Bannon's argument was that there's you know
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:03.160]  Something to the it didn't quite say it was a problem
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:08.440]  But you could tell that's where he was going that when two-thirds or three-fourths of the CEOs in Silicon Valley are from Asia
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:10.440]  or South Asia
[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:12.760]  You know, that's a problem and you know
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:15.460]  like I
[01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:19.260]  There's no way to avoid it. I mean either you either you look at something and you see like
[01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:21.060]  A
[01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:24.740]  Sundar Pichai who was born in India is the CEO of
[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:31.620]  One of the most successful companies in the history of the United States you either see that as a great success
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:34.100]  I mean, I just there's no common ground
[01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:39.700]  I see this as that Sundar Pichai is proof that the system works and that our country can be great and
[01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:44.340]  Steve Bannon holds it up as an you know, like a problem to be so that needs a solution
[01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:50.580]  And I don't know. I don't see how yeah, I think you referred to it as a cultural right that you know
[01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:56.780]  It refers to our culture that we have to maintain a certain culture and then the question then becomes you mean white culture
[01:25:56.780 --> 01:25:57.720]  Right, right
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:03.060]  Like do you mean you mean that the European people who came over and killed off the natives?
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.200]  Like those are the folks that are the best
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:10.220]  Excuse me. Those are the folks that are the best and those those that's the culture we need to maintain and
[01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:15.340]  You know, I mean, I think that you have to take that stuff at face value
[01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:19.760]  and I think that was I think you you wrote something about this, but
[01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:25.520]  You know everybody that was saying it even Peter Thiel said this and nobody really believed him at the time
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:29.620]  But it really looks pretty gross in retrospect
[01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:34.500]  You know in terms of a gross miscalculation or gross dissembling
[01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:36.340]  of
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:37.660]  the truth
[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:42.900]  And that is that you know, you don't take him literally right right did don't take Trump literally
[01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:47.060]  Take him at his his intent not his word or whatever
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:51.980]  They you know saying was but it's become very clear that you have to take this stuff literally
[01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:56.140]  So if you look at statements like that you go, okay. Well, you know if this person's
[01:26:57.460 --> 01:27:00.620]  you know policies or whatever are enacted then
[01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:07.620]  you know, they their goal is to create a safe space for white people in America and then to
[01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:10.380]  You know
[01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:18.180]  Destroy as much of the current government establishment as possible because they view it as corrupt or unnecessary
[01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:21.300]  because he's he says he views himself as a
[01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:25.540]  Leninist or whatever and he'd like to just do this is Bannon
[01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:29.080]  I'd like to tear down as much of the existing government as possible
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.320]  So you look at things like that and you can look at them
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:37.440]  Hey, you know, oh, I'm intellectually curious about what this person's views are and you know where this gentleman is coming from
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:42.000]  And then you can look at the stuff that's happened in the last week and you can go
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  oh, maybe I should take this as a statement of fact and not a statement of philosophy or or
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:52.380]  Game theory. Yeah, and I think that that is a very
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:56.000]  Scary proposition. I have a theory on that front
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.880]  and you know, it is as much a hope as as a
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:09.480]  Well, I can't prove it but it's certainly what I hope in terms of the sustainability of this administration
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:12.280]  It's a fact that according to polls
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:20.640]  These is the least popular incoming president in modern history meaning in the history of like the Gallup poll and modern polling technology
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:28.240]  And with just about every previous or in fact, not just about with every previous elected new president
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:35.620]  There is this grace period after the election where the as soon as the elections over. Here's the winner
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:42.200]  You know, congratulations and the campaigning stops. There is a groundswell of support and their popularity
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:49.620]  Grows they enter office with an approval rating that is higher. This was true for Reagan. This was true for Carter
[01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:51.620]  Bill Clinton
[01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:53.660]  George W. Bush George
[01:28:54.100 --> 01:29:02.260]  HW Bush, it's always been true and it's not true with Trump Trump's popularity and approvals went down between the election and starting and
[01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:12.060]  Amazingly his gallop approval rating went down eight points in his first week as president which just doesn't happen and again
[01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:17.460]  I don't know, but I've probably lost everybody who's anybody who was listening. It was a Trump
[01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:18.940]  a supporter
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:21.460]  But I don't I think I lost him a while ago
[01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:26.700]  but here's the hope for somebody who's opposed to Trump is my theory is that Trump had a
[01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:29.700]  coalition of voters
[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:31.060]  who
[01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:33.060]  Half of them. Let's say roughly
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:38.520]  Loved every literal word. He said they wanted to lock her up. They wanted to build a wall
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:41.700]  They wanted to make Mexico pay for the wall that they didn't want
[01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:49.300]  They wanted to ban Muslims from the country and then the other half were the like the Peter Thiel type
[01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:51.580]  and which is why I wrote about it, which is the
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:56.780]  You can't take this guy. Literally. He says these things because they sound good. He's a showman
[01:29:56.900 --> 01:30:01.900]  That's he's not gonna do any of this stuff. You know, it's just think of the vague intent, you know
[01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:05.940]  it's you know, Teal's description and it's so funny that he picked up on the
[01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:13.020]  The ban the Muslims was that oh, yeah, he just says that but what he really means is they're gonna have a sane image
[01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:20.220]  They're just gonna have a saner smarter immigration policy. Well, this this immigration policy is insane and it's not smarter. It's poorly written
[01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:21.860]  It's hard to execute
[01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:22.420]  I
[01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:27.300]  think what's happening with Trump's approval is that the people the only people he's going to be left with are the
[01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:30.780]  group that wanted him to be taken literally and that the group who
[01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:38.060]  didn't want to take him literally and just assumed that he wouldn't are jumping ship because now they see that he actually is doing these these
[01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:41.020]  Things and I don't think that there's widespread support for them
[01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:48.980]  Yeah, yeah it is I mean there's there's like a couple of
[01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:52.700]  There's a couple of accounts on Twitter because sort of collating
[01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:57.620]  Regretful Trump voters. Hmm who we are expressing their
[01:30:57.620 --> 01:31:01.140]  There's one today that you know hundreds of tweets long
[01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:04.020]  sort of before and after
[01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:08.700]  Tweets the first it's like clipping the I'm afraid I don't remember the account right now
[01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:14.100]  But they're clipping the before tweet, you know when they're like, oh Trump is gonna exit why and you know
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:18.260]  Trust him and then the after where it's like he's not gonna do this at all
[01:31:18.260 --> 01:31:21.740]  I'm not now I'm not gonna have health care or whatever and I think that there is
[01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:24.960]  there's a schadenfreude in that but if there's also like
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:27.400]  when people say you have to
[01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:35.920]  See the other side and or you know cross borders to make that it always seems like it's always one side having to cross those
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:42.380]  Borders, but I think I honestly think there's opportunity there to not be like Nelson, haha and be like
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:45.120]  Look you were fooled
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:47.280]  now let's fix it right and
[01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:49.720]  unfortunately
[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:51.720]  You know for many people
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:57.660]  Unfortunately for especially for people who are very solidly were very solidly Hillary Clinton supporters or whatever
[01:31:58.140 --> 01:32:00.800]  Fixing it is going to end up with Pence in power
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:08.860]  I mean the worst-case scenario is that you know for those folks is definitely Bannon stays in power and implements his true strategy
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:15.020]  Which he laid out very explicitly and you have to believe he wants those things because he's you know
[01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:17.080]  written and
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:20.900]  Influenced all of the other stuff so far that's matched up one for one, right?
[01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:25.820]  and so that's your worst-case scenario that buddy your best-case scenario is Pence, which
[01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:28.460]  You know Pence does not share
[01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:32.300]  Liberal values at all, right? I mean very far, right?
[01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:37.020]  You would consider him one of the farthest right if it wasn't for the Bannon Trump
[01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:40.540]  Conglomerate, right
[01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:47.240]  So yeah, it's gonna be a rough four years. I think for anybody. Well rough to it maybe if this
[01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:50.220]  groundswell of
[01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:52.220]  disapproval and or
[01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:57.580]  You know activity or our activism is able to carry for two years
[01:32:58.060 --> 01:33:02.800]  You get into the the midterm elections and maybe you know
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:09.260]  The checks and balances are back in place where some sort of middle ground is found between the two halves of the country
[01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:12.060]  Literally almost two halves of the voting public, right?
[01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:15.020]  You know, so it's it's definitely
[01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:18.020]  It's at times like this where you realize
[01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:20.020]  just how
[01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:21.940]  important to
[01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:26.600]  The balance of the force so to speak those checks and balances are yeah when they're not there anymore
[01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:30.100]  It's it's a very sudden cold bath, you know
[01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:35.600]  Yep, and you know, I don't think we're at the end of it and in terms of issues that will just pop up
[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:38.380]  and
[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:40.380]  unexpectedly that draw
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:46.120]  You know the industry that we cover into it directly. I mean, there's gonna be something I mean for example
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:48.340]  I mean, I mean Trump was harping about it a year ago
[01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:50.980]  with the San Bernardino case and
[01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:53.740]  apples
[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:59.420]  Studied refusal to to give the FBI, you know, not to go down that whole story again, but you know
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:02.740]  they didn't want to give them an OS to unlock the phone and and
[01:34:03.260 --> 01:34:09.260]  It's gonna be a little different when and Trump is the president instead of just the candidate and he's fighting back against it
[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:11.340]  So I'm sure we'll go down that path again
[01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:16.100]  But yeah, I mean cyber security is the next big thing. So we'll see
[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:19.380]  All right briefly because I know we've gone over Giuliani's in charge. So we're fine
[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:24.580]  One last thing. I just wanted to touch on is that you I don't know how many years now
[01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:27.140]  You've been going but last week you were at Sundance in Utah
[01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:30.140]  yeah, and
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:36.000]  So tell me about it tell me what you know, you seems like you really have a good time out there
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.120]  Yes, I mean I haven't I haven't been going as long as some folks
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:44.160]  I mean obviously it's been going on for decades, but I started going in
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:47.480]  20
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:53.400]  13 2012 2013 somewhere in there. So for a few years now, I've been going every year and I
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:35:00.240]  Like it a lot. I mean it's you know, I like everything about it. There's you go to this town in Utah
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:05.360]  It's Park City, which is the Sun dances covers Salt Lake City Park City
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:11.880]  And a couple of other small venues like Robert Redford's house and personal screening room and some other things
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:19.480]  He's got a whole conclave up there the dude basically just owns his whole town that's really funny
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:22.760]  but it's a
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:28.280]  You go it's in the snow. There's nothing else to do but watch movies and eat
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:33.880]  You're you know, you're kind of locked in. I mean you could ski and stuff. I'd never do I always tell myself
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:39.280]  Oh, but then, you know take an afternoon or whatever, but there's always seems to be something to see or something to do
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:43.320]  But you go and you're snow locked in this little town
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:46.080]  Everybody there is is there to see movies
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:53.600]  There are like 60 70 movies that play every day across all the venues. You can only see three or four of them a day
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:56.720]  I mean that's if you pack them in. Yeah, how do you decide how do you I mean?
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:01.760]  what do you do to get like a is there just like a here you get like you you get like a pass and here's
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:04.240]  A list of all the movies and you just go through and pick them
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:07.120]  Yeah, it's different for pass holders
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:09.040]  so if you're a pass holder you buy a
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:14.560]  Package which gives you access to certain kinds of tickets and so many tickets a day or whatever the case, right?
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:19.760]  You know those pass holders get some nice perks like they get to go in and see get seated first in a theater and whatnot
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:24.200]  but I go as press because I do cover a variety of things like last year for instance the
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:27.640]  the documentary that Werner Herzog
[01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:32.080]  Documentary on on the internet, you know and the kind of impact of the internet
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:37.000]  Was showing there so I got to interview him and and wrote about that for TechCrunch
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:44.120]  And so I when I in they've more and more stuff for there is interactive with VR and AR versus just films
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:48.840]  so when I go I always find something to write about for TechCrunch and it's
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:55.800]  It's fun to go as press because you get you sign up you get your press pass your press pass allows you to see any
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:57.800]  Press screening they have essentially one
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:04.200]  For theater multiplex where it runs press P&I screenings all day. So press it industry
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:07.240]  So you can go to any of those just get in line and go in and watch those
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:14.520]  and then you can also wait list for any movie throughout the day and wait listing is essentially they have a little app and you you
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:21.200]  when the waitlist thing turns on you hit go and it assigns you a number and so the overflow seating which they have between
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:27.640]  40 and 100 to 200 seats on every theater assigned to the waitlist you could possibly get in if you don't have a ticket
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:31.720]  You buy your ticket for $20 that each movie ticket is $20
[01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:37.120]  And then you go in and see this movie that nobody's ever seen so it's kind of a good deal for like local residents and folks
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:38.600]  That don't have ticket packages
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:43.300]  But for the press you sign up you get your app your press pass which allows you to do all that
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:49.880]  Then you get 10 free complimentary tickets over the course of the show and then you can request between one and two tickets every day
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:51.760]  via the press office in the morning
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:54.040]  So everybody rushes down and you know says oh
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:57.800]  I'm trying to see this or that and they sell out of those tickets once they sell out and that's it
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:02.560]  So in general like this last time I don't I haven't I don't have my stubs in front of me to count
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:06.480]  But I think I saw I got there Thursday and left Tuesday morning
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:11.160]  It was a short trip for me and I saw think 20 movies in that space of time
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:16.080]  Well, and then a bunch of VR exhibits. So I mean you pack it in, you know, you're there you might as well
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:22.760]  You know, I mean I do anyway, you know different people handle it differently the film journalists usually stay there for a week or even two
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:31.280]  Because it's the runs two weeks and that second week is our second weekend slash week is great because nobody's there
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:33.480]  I've gone in the second week some years and
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:34.740]  You know
[01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:41.480]  It's it's purely about the movies like the stars have all left to go back to their lives or wherever the first week
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:43.880]  every showing you go to
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:45.880]  the director or
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:51.740]  The actors or everybody involved is there you get to see it essentially with the people that made the movie
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:57.920]  Including down to the grips and camera guys or whoever else came and then there's Q&A's after every movie
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:02.460]  So you get kind of you know, talk to the filmmakers about their motivations and all that stuff
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:05.040]  Person-to-person right there. So it's pretty fun
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:09.600]  What was the best movie that you saw? Yeah, can you can you pick one?
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:12.320]  Give a handful. Yeah, I'm gonna write about it, too
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:15.560]  Yeah, yeah, there's a couple that I found really good
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:18.160]  I mean, there's a couple that are non tech related that I saw while I was there
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:21.760]  The big sick, which is Kumail Nanjiani
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:28.000]  He he wrote that with his wife about their experiences. Kumail's one of the guys from Silicon Valley
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:30.240]  is
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:32.240]  He plays one of the programmers
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:38.560]  Very good, and you'll you'll hear about this. I think Netflix bought them actually, so you should be able to watch it on Netflix
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:42.400]  I don't know if they're gonna release it theatrically or directly on Netflix, but
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:47.400]  Netflix and Amazon were big enormous presences there. Yeah, they bought a ton of movies
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:50.200]  This is like for 2013
[01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:58.160]  There was just like rumblings that Netflix is like poking around like there are people here and then year after year
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:01.120]  They got to be a more and more of a presence until this year
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:01.960]  it was like
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:06.820]  you know they were they were some of the biggest purchasers at the show and they were on everybody's lips and
[01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:11.180]  Many of the movies that premiered there had already been pre-purchased by Netflix and things like that
[01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:13.220]  So it's you know
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:18.260]  My world was colliding with with Sundance's world at a rapid pace over the last several years
[01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:23.760]  And it's got to be it has to be from their perspective a lower risk way because these are movies that are already made
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.760]  You know that and it you know
[01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:32.540]  That you could say look I you know and and there's some subjectiveness to it where obviously whoever it is from Netflix is watching
[01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:33.740]  The movie and saying yeah, this is good
[01:40:33.740 --> 01:40:39.820]  You know making a subjective judgment that this this is a good good movie or good enough that we should think about buying it
[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:44.340]  But then once they do that the risk is so much lower than backing something
[01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:47.740]  But you know when it's just a screenplay and there's so much uncertainty
[01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:51.380]  You know, who are you gonna get who you can you cast? Is it gonna come together, you know?
[01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:54.780]  So
[01:40:54.820 --> 01:40:56.060]  Right
[01:40:56.060 --> 01:41:01.280]  Right and like last every time I go that one of them my favorite things to do is when I'm in line
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:05.460]  I just talk to people because in general these are film industry people that are there
[01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:09.060]  I mean, they're fans too, right just folks that want to see movies
[01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:10.740]  But like I've talked to you know
[01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:17.040]  Academy award-winning producers that are just standing in line and we just have a discussion right because they're waiting to see some new thing
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:19.040]  And they're like, oh, yeah, I hear it's great or whatever
[01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:20.400]  and you know
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:27.060]  I talked to them about their next project and about the industry and blah blah blah and like I talked to buyers and and
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:29.740]  Producers and when they're talking about Netflix
[01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:31.740]  and Amazon they're talking about
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:34.580]  Like I asked him. Hey, is this a challenge to you?
[01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:39.620]  Is it like do you view it as like an invasion or whatever and they're there, you know in general
[01:41:39.620 --> 01:41:42.740]  The response has been very positive. I mean they're like hell no for us
[01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:47.500]  It's like a way to tell a filmmaker look you can use these people to make your next movie
[01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:51.940]  In other words sell this movie. You're not gonna bet, you know be rich off of it or whatever
[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:55.700]  You're gonna make a decent deal because neither neither Amazon
[01:41:55.700 --> 01:42:00.440]  I mean Amazon and Netflix are overpaying right now for movies simply because a they have the money and be there
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:02.440]  They're sort of trying to build momentum
[01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:05.020]  but they're also
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:09.680]  enabling filmmakers to just boom like sell that and then
[01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:14.820]  Make another movie right like you move on to your next project and then allows them to build a body of work
[01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:16.820]  And it's just like a new plug-and-play
[01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:20.620]  distributor that they're able to just go and say
[01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:25.140]  Netflix comes with their corpus of data and says this is what we know works
[01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:30.860]  Amazon comes with their deep pockets and says hey, we're gonna really shoot theatrically like they're different playbooks
[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:36.680]  There's no they're not just like bland entities that handle things the same way, you know, they definitely distribute them very differently
[01:42:37.580 --> 01:42:43.060]  But lot do new opportunities, you know for filmmakers any other movies you want to give a shout out to other than the big sick
[01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:47.660]  Yeah, Marjorie Prime. I really really liked it. Marjorie Prime is a
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:49.740]  movie
[01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:51.740]  that stars
[01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:55.900]  John Hamm
[01:42:56.620 --> 01:42:58.620]  Gina Davis
[01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:01.460]  Who else
[01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:07.020]  Tim Robbins, hmm is in it as well. So I mean like, you know all all-star cast
[01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:09.860]  I mean, it's directed by this guy named Michael
[01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:13.740]  Ama Reda, I think Ama Reda. I'm
[01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:20.460]  I might mispronounce it. He he directed Hamlet and I remember with Ethan Hawke. Yes, I do back. Yeah, but
[01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:27.900]  Yeah, the movie stars Lois Smith and Lois Smith is a very venerable actress. You you have seen her, you know
[01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:34.900]  You view listeners out there. You have seen her in something. Trust me, but she our if you remember East of Eden. Yeah
[01:43:35.340 --> 01:43:40.940]  With yeah. Yeah, so she was in that like she's been in in the biz a long time. You know, I think she's
[01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:44.780]  80 85 86 now, but she was in you know
[01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:49.660]  She's been in tons of stuff that people have seen like fried green tomatoes and twister and you know
[01:43:49.900 --> 01:43:51.460]  True-blood and all kinds of stuff, right?
[01:43:51.460 --> 01:43:58.140]  But she played that she plays a character who is losing her memory either via dementia or Alzheimer's or whatever
[01:43:58.620 --> 01:44:04.860]  And her family and she played this same character in a stage play written by the guy who you know
[01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:09.940]  They adapted the screenplay off of and she's played that character twice in two runs of that play
[01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:14.700]  and then he directed this director directed her in this movie version of that play and
[01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:19.980]  She's an older woman who's losing her cognitive ability and her family
[01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:28.140]  Purchases her an AI called the prime and that prime is there to talk with her and to help her to
[01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:29.980]  keep those
[01:44:29.980 --> 01:44:35.060]  memory pathways active right to help her relive her life and
[01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:41.860]  And they talk about her memories. So John Hamm plays her husband in his younger state
[01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:43.860]  Because that's the way she wanted to remember him
[01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:49.340]  And the prime is set up to engage with her and ask her about her life and to learn
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:54.220]  So when she talks to it, it learns about her life essentially learning to be more human and more like him
[01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:56.140]  but
[01:44:56.140 --> 01:44:58.780]  the themes obviously the AI
[01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:04.180]  You know component of it is a huge portion of the theme but the themes I found absolutely just
[01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:11.500]  You spellbinding. I mean I was barely breathing by the end of it and it's not a very it's not a thriller by any means
[01:45:11.500 --> 01:45:13.500]  You know, it's an extremely calm
[01:45:13.860 --> 01:45:20.700]  meditative movie that I found to be extremely well acted full of nuance and addressed address some really really
[01:45:21.340 --> 01:45:24.980]  You know interesting topics about AI the way it will
[01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:26.420]  affect us
[01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:32.020]  You know the way that humans can sort of impart their being to AI in the future or may
[01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:34.020]  Impart them if it ever gets to that point
[01:45:34.380 --> 01:45:38.100]  You know, it's very very interesting. So how do you recommend checking it out when it comes out?
[01:45:38.100 --> 01:45:40.500]  I think maybe Netflix bought it sounds right up
[01:45:40.740 --> 01:45:48.020]  I feel like we're entering a goal I guess as Hollywood devolves into nothing but sequels to franchises
[01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:52.500]  and 300 million dollar budgets and the expectation, you know that
[01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:57.700]  The last two-thirds of the movie is going to be blowing up a city every single time
[01:45:58.380 --> 01:46:00.380]  we're entering like a
[01:46:00.380 --> 01:46:02.380]  a golden age of
[01:46:02.460 --> 01:46:05.340]  Smaller budget, you know what used to be called indie movies
[01:46:05.340 --> 01:46:09.100]  I don't know what you want to call them now, but you know outside Hollywood and outside the blockbuster
[01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:11.380]  mindset of science fiction
[01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:13.500]  And a lot of them I mean and you know
[01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:18.340]  it's no surprise that we're that people are thinking about AI because it's starting to get real and
[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:19.900]  It's so great
[01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:22.420]  It is so refreshing to see movies about AI
[01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:28.380]  That have gotten away from AI that goes bad and takes over the planet, right? Exactly
[01:46:28.380 --> 01:46:31.420]  that's what yeah, that's what you normally see and I mean
[01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:36.340]  I the one thing one thing I will say this might be an interesting to two people listening is
[01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:39.220]  That the mood at Sundance this year
[01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:41.140]  I mean I like I said, I'm not you know
[01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:47.420]  I'm not claiming to be some historian of Sundance but the mood this year compared to years past because remember the
[01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:51.980]  Inauguration was happening on that Friday the of the beginning of the festival
[01:46:51.980 --> 01:46:56.420]  Yeah, and all this stuff started happening, you know, like there's these the first
[01:46:56.420 --> 01:46:57.460]  at
[01:46:57.460 --> 01:47:01.620]  executive actions and stuff started being passed and all this and people were realizing just how much
[01:47:02.020 --> 01:47:07.900]  Trump was being going to be the Trump he promised to be and the mood at Sundance was insane
[01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:13.660]  I mean it was somber and meditative and defiant and you know as artists being artists, you know
[01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:16.720]  Just saying like we're not gonna give up the light
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:21.820]  We're gonna push and we're gonna tell stories and we're going to help unify via those stories
[01:47:21.820 --> 01:47:28.980]  You know Redford and various programmers made comments as I was sitting in, you know screenings and things like that about
[01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:34.060]  Telling challenging and difficult stories and not letting up on that
[01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:40.780]  It was just seemed very very interesting very very unified in its in its emotion, you know
[01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:44.860]  And then years past it was all over the place, you know, people have different thoughts and feelings
[01:47:44.860 --> 01:47:47.280]  But it seemed very very interesting to me
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:52.260]  So it'll be interesting to see how artists and filmmakers and people like that react over the next several years
[01:47:52.900 --> 01:47:55.020]  well, it's nice to talk about something a little bit nicer than
[01:47:56.380 --> 01:47:59.820]  Trump but it inevitably came back to Trump
[01:48:03.580 --> 01:48:11.060]  My thanks to you for your time, this was a great discussion everybody can find you on Twitter. What's your Twitter handle?
[01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:17.740]  Mmm panzer pan z er and of course your good work as
