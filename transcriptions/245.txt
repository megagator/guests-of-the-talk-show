[00:00.000 --> 00:01.260]  I feel like you're on a roll.
[00:01.260 --> 00:02.100]  Oh, thank you.
[00:02.100 --> 00:03.740]  But you had a really good video the other day,
[00:03.740 --> 00:07.340]  I don't have it in the notes yet, but I will,
[00:09.040 --> 00:14.040]  on this analytics situation in the App Store.
[00:14.900 --> 00:17.080]  We're just jumping right in, no small talk today.
[00:17.080 --> 00:18.140]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:18.140 --> 00:21.020]  But this analytic situation in the App Store
[00:21.020 --> 00:23.340]  and with these apps being discovered,
[00:23.340 --> 00:25.980]  it's like everything with Facebook,
[00:25.980 --> 00:29.300]  it's an unrolling scandal.
[00:29.300 --> 00:31.120]  Like, it's not like never ending.
[00:31.120 --> 00:34.620]  Never ending, we learn one thing after another.
[00:36.780 --> 00:40.460]  But basically the Wall Street Journal had a story last week
[00:40.460 --> 00:43.120]  that really escalated this, where they did some research
[00:43.120 --> 00:48.120]  on a bunch of apps that take, by nature of the app,
[00:50.900 --> 00:52.780]  they take very personal information.
[00:52.780 --> 00:57.100]  These are things like menstrual cycle calendar trackers
[00:57.100 --> 01:02.100]  for women, what are some of the other examples?
[01:03.180 --> 01:04.020]  The real estate apps.
[01:04.020 --> 01:04.860]  Real estate apps.
[01:04.860 --> 01:06.420]  What houses you wanted to buy, yeah,
[01:06.420 --> 01:07.460]  there's a range of them.
[01:07.460 --> 01:11.420]  And yeah, so it's like financial information
[01:11.420 --> 01:12.260]  and stuff like that.
[01:12.260 --> 01:16.540]  And they got security experts and they, I guess,
[01:16.540 --> 01:18.980]  hooked these things up to something to look
[01:18.980 --> 01:21.140]  at the network traffic coming in and out of the phones.
[01:21.140 --> 01:25.380]  And these apps all, as soon as you'd enter this information,
[01:25.380 --> 01:27.820]  you put your weight in, and as soon as you do it,
[01:27.820 --> 01:29.260]  it goes right to Facebook.
[01:29.260 --> 01:30.100]  Yep.
[01:31.300 --> 01:33.100]  And my favorite part is right after the article,
[01:33.100 --> 01:35.200]  Will's Traffic, you know, at Chronic on Twitter,
[01:35.200 --> 01:38.540]  who's just absolutely fantastic on information security,
[01:38.540 --> 01:40.420]  he got involved and started decompiling a bunch
[01:40.420 --> 01:42.260]  of other ones and finding like some of them
[01:42.260 --> 01:44.580]  were sending Google how often you had sex,
[01:44.580 --> 01:45.860]  whether it was protected or not,
[01:45.860 --> 01:47.620]  whether you were trying to conceive or not.
[01:47.620 --> 01:50.380]  Right, which people are entering into these apps voluntarily
[01:50.380 --> 01:54.020]  because they're doing it for purposes of, you know,
[01:54.020 --> 01:58.020]  like the period trackers, you know, whether it's,
[01:58.020 --> 02:00.020]  you know, even women who aren't trying to get pregnant
[02:00.020 --> 02:03.460]  might be tracking their period for health-related purposes.
[02:03.460 --> 02:04.540]  It didn't even wait.
[02:04.540 --> 02:05.660]  It didn't even roll out.
[02:05.660 --> 02:07.140]  The second you put the information in,
[02:07.140 --> 02:08.980]  it was sent to Facebook or Google or Flurry
[02:08.980 --> 02:10.540]  or a company like that.
[02:10.540 --> 02:11.620]  Yeah, it's really strange.
[02:11.620 --> 02:13.740]  And you know, and there've been stories for a while
[02:13.740 --> 02:17.940]  about other such things where retailers
[02:17.940 --> 02:20.620]  have been tracking people in the real world
[02:20.620 --> 02:23.860]  and Target can figure out, or to name one example,
[02:23.860 --> 02:27.300]  that if you buy X, Y, and Z,
[02:27.300 --> 02:31.420]  there's a 85% chance that you just found out
[02:31.420 --> 02:32.580]  you're pregnant, you know?
[02:32.580 --> 02:33.420]  Yeah.
[02:33.420 --> 02:34.420]  And some of it's obvious, duh,
[02:34.420 --> 02:37.660]  it's like prenatal vitamins or something like that.
[02:37.660 --> 02:39.460]  But then, you know, but just other things,
[02:39.460 --> 02:41.860]  there's just weird connections where, you know,
[02:43.420 --> 02:45.660]  skin lotion or something like that, you know,
[02:45.660 --> 02:46.900]  but they can make these connections
[02:46.900 --> 02:48.660]  and then start sending you,
[02:48.660 --> 02:49.980]  if you're on their mailing list,
[02:49.980 --> 02:53.980]  start sending you spam, you know,
[02:53.980 --> 02:58.540]  mailing you spam for baby stuff, just weird, you know?
[02:58.540 --> 02:59.900]  And a lot of times the companies,
[02:59.900 --> 03:01.540]  they'll always say, oh, it's anonymized,
[03:01.540 --> 03:04.420]  but unless you're doing sort of like what Apple does
[03:04.420 --> 03:06.220]  with unique tokens that expire immediately
[03:06.220 --> 03:08.660]  and different, unless you're going that extra mile,
[03:08.660 --> 03:10.380]  anonymizing data doesn't do anything.
[03:10.380 --> 03:12.660]  It has been proven trivial for these companies
[03:12.660 --> 03:14.940]  to get even just one single data point
[03:14.940 --> 03:17.900]  to tie you into these profiles or shadow profiles
[03:17.900 --> 03:19.380]  if you don't use their services.
[03:19.380 --> 03:21.900]  And then they know exactly who that data is coming from.
[03:21.900 --> 03:23.860]  Yeah, yeah, that's exactly right, right.
[03:23.860 --> 03:26.620]  So yeah, the claims that this is anonymous,
[03:26.620 --> 03:28.260]  that they're just sending, oh yeah,
[03:28.260 --> 03:30.940]  it's just a person who's telling us exactly, you know,
[03:30.940 --> 03:33.860]  how much they weigh and what they've eaten today.
[03:33.860 --> 03:35.940]  You know, it doesn't hold much water
[03:35.940 --> 03:37.300]  to say that it's anonymized
[03:37.300 --> 03:40.380]  because they can connect this in other ways.
[03:40.380 --> 03:41.380]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:41.380 --> 03:44.180]  And so anyway, you had a video about this on your channel
[03:44.180 --> 03:46.980]  and I thought one of the really interesting segments of it
[03:46.980 --> 03:50.380]  was you pulled up an old, well, obviously old at this point,
[03:50.380 --> 03:52.460]  but like, I think it was from 2011,
[03:52.460 --> 03:54.700]  Steve Jobs at the All Things D conference
[03:54.700 --> 03:57.540]  talking about a scandal at the time
[03:57.540 --> 04:00.820]  that I had since forgotten, the Flurry Analytics thing.
[04:00.820 --> 04:02.740]  Can you describe that?
[04:02.740 --> 04:04.980]  Yeah, so what happened was this article came out
[04:04.980 --> 04:07.700]  saying that Apple was working on new iPhones, of course,
[04:07.700 --> 04:09.620]  and on tablet devices.
[04:09.620 --> 04:13.100]  And it was based on developers using Flurry Analytics
[04:13.100 --> 04:15.580]  and people inside Apple using those apps
[04:15.580 --> 04:18.180]  and the information on the devices being reported.
[04:18.180 --> 04:21.420]  But what's delightful on stage is like you get,
[04:21.420 --> 04:24.020]  Jobs has asked about it and he just starts saying like,
[04:24.020 --> 04:27.180]  we learned about this and we were pissed off.
[04:27.180 --> 04:30.020]  You know, there was still, and he's just so angry
[04:30.020 --> 04:32.740]  that Apple immediately changed the App Store regulations
[04:32.740 --> 04:35.500]  to forbid these kinds of analytics.
[04:35.500 --> 04:36.900]  And it was immediately, you know,
[04:36.900 --> 04:39.900]  it bothered him because he's big about surprise and delight
[04:39.900 --> 04:40.820]  and it basically betrayed
[04:40.820 --> 04:43.460]  what Apple's upcoming product roadmap was.
[04:43.460 --> 04:45.700]  And it seems like that is not at all dissimilar
[04:45.700 --> 04:46.540]  to what these apps,
[04:46.540 --> 04:48.020]  they're not doing it for devices anymore,
[04:48.020 --> 04:49.780]  but they're doing it for the customers.
[04:49.780 --> 04:52.620]  And there was, yeah, and it was like,
[04:52.620 --> 04:54.860]  so we, you know, all this, this company came out,
[04:54.860 --> 04:56.780]  they had, they had, they used the analytics
[04:56.780 --> 04:58.980]  to figure out there was like a new iPad coming out,
[04:58.980 --> 05:00.580]  you know, cause they could tell from, you know,
[05:00.580 --> 05:04.300]  the code running in the analytics framework,
[05:04.300 --> 05:05.820]  you know, would probe the system and say,
[05:05.820 --> 05:08.860]  oh yeah, this is iPhone or iPad model, you know,
[05:08.860 --> 05:11.140]  two comma one or whatever was a new iPad.
[05:11.140 --> 05:13.820]  And, you know, like he said, we looked at these apps
[05:13.820 --> 05:15.300]  and it turned out that they were all using
[05:15.300 --> 05:16.500]  this flurry analytics.
[05:16.500 --> 05:18.700]  And we were like, what the hell is that?
[05:18.700 --> 05:19.540]  Yeah.
[05:21.540 --> 05:22.500]  Yeah, he was mad.
[05:22.500 --> 05:25.020]  Yeah, well, and it's an interesting kind of mad
[05:25.020 --> 05:27.180]  because he's aware that he's on stage
[05:27.180 --> 05:29.340]  and, you know, who can even imagine how, you know,
[05:29.340 --> 05:31.940]  what his reaction was inside Apple
[05:31.940 --> 05:33.780]  when he wasn't on camera and wasn't on stage
[05:33.780 --> 05:36.180]  when he found out that this is what was going on.
[05:37.100 --> 05:40.420]  But it was an interesting anecdote,
[05:40.420 --> 05:41.300]  a really good pull.
[05:41.300 --> 05:44.380]  I had forgotten about it and I feel like it really,
[05:44.380 --> 05:49.380]  you know, I don't know, it really hit me in the video
[05:49.660 --> 05:53.580]  because it really shows how this has been going on
[05:53.580 --> 05:57.180]  for a while, that Apple sort of has a blind spot to it
[05:57.180 --> 05:58.900]  because they don't collect it, right?
[05:58.900 --> 06:01.860]  Like, and I feel like that what Jobs is saying,
[06:01.860 --> 06:04.500]  you know, maybe they shouldn't have been surprised that-
[06:04.500 --> 06:05.860]  Well, he says that they're naive.
[06:05.860 --> 06:06.980]  That was the exact word he used.
[06:06.980 --> 06:08.300]  Yeah, so there you go, you know,
[06:08.300 --> 06:09.940]  right out of the horse's mouth.
[06:09.940 --> 06:14.660]  I mean, no bones about it, right?
[06:14.660 --> 06:15.500]  Yeah.
[06:15.500 --> 06:20.260]  I feel like that as much as you would like to think,
[06:20.260 --> 06:22.060]  well, there Apple, you know, woke up
[06:22.060 --> 06:23.220]  and they got their handle on it,
[06:23.220 --> 06:26.460]  but it's for everything we've seen in the last few years,
[06:26.460 --> 06:28.820]  especially the last couple of months with these stories
[06:28.820 --> 06:31.060]  from TechCrunch and now the Wall Street Journal,
[06:31.060 --> 06:33.780]  that it's, I don't know if I want to say Apple
[06:33.780 --> 06:35.700]  is still naive about this stuff,
[06:35.700 --> 06:39.500]  but it's clearly spiraled out of their control
[06:39.500 --> 06:40.340]  in some ways.
[06:40.340 --> 06:41.260]  Yeah, and what's hard too,
[06:41.260 --> 06:42.620]  is that there are a lot of edge cases.
[06:42.620 --> 06:44.140]  For example, there was a brouhaha
[06:44.140 --> 06:46.620]  about apps uploading your contact information,
[06:46.620 --> 06:49.100]  which is sometimes good, sometimes bad,
[06:49.100 --> 06:50.020]  because there are apps,
[06:50.020 --> 06:51.140]  like you want to be able to download
[06:51.140 --> 06:53.300]  a third-party address book app,
[06:53.300 --> 06:54.780]  if you know one of our really creative friends
[06:54.780 --> 06:57.100]  were to make one that's way better than the system app,
[06:57.100 --> 06:58.820]  and you'd have to grant it access
[06:58.820 --> 07:00.460]  to the universal contacts database
[07:00.460 --> 07:02.500]  for it to do anything important to you.
[07:02.500 --> 07:04.020]  The same way, like if you use Tweetbot,
[07:04.020 --> 07:06.900]  you have to give it access to your Twitter profile,
[07:06.900 --> 07:08.100]  but then there are other apps
[07:08.100 --> 07:09.820]  that want to spam your Twitter followers,
[07:09.820 --> 07:12.500]  or other apps that want to just steal all your contacts,
[07:12.500 --> 07:14.220]  and once you grant permission,
[07:14.220 --> 07:16.780]  there has to be some way for Apple to then follow up
[07:16.780 --> 07:17.620]  and hold them accountable
[07:17.620 --> 07:20.420]  for what they do with that information.
[07:20.420 --> 07:22.180]  Did you see, I put it in the show notes,
[07:22.180 --> 07:25.100]  that our friends at Objective Development,
[07:25.100 --> 07:29.140]  that they're the makers of a bunch of great Mac utilities,
[07:29.140 --> 07:30.420]  like Launch Bar,
[07:30.420 --> 07:33.580]  and they have a long-standing utility called Little Snitch,
[07:33.580 --> 07:36.980]  which is a utility you install,
[07:36.980 --> 07:41.980]  and then basically monitors every app you're running,
[07:42.340 --> 07:45.260]  and notifies you when they make a network connection,
[07:45.260 --> 07:48.340]  and you can say, okay, well, this is, you know,
[07:48.340 --> 07:50.740]  obviously I want you to allow my email client
[07:50.740 --> 07:53.220]  to connect to the server to get my email and send email,
[07:53.220 --> 07:55.860]  and you can say it, don't, you know,
[07:55.860 --> 07:57.020]  I don't want to be, you know,
[07:57.020 --> 07:58.820]  you can dial down the filter
[07:58.820 --> 08:00.540]  so that you're not getting pinged about everything,
[08:00.540 --> 08:02.780]  because there's all sorts of stuff on your Mac
[08:02.780 --> 08:04.740]  that you know is making network connections,
[08:04.740 --> 08:08.740]  but it's a way to bring your attention to bits of network,
[08:08.740 --> 08:11.740]  networking that you perhaps weren't aware of.
[08:14.820 --> 08:15.660]  Yes.
[08:15.660 --> 08:17.620]  And they have something, I hadn't seen this,
[08:17.620 --> 08:19.700]  but they tweeted this at me,
[08:19.700 --> 08:22.780]  something called the Internet Access Policy,
[08:23.940 --> 08:24.780]  and they're-
[08:24.780 --> 08:25.740]  It looks great.
[08:25.740 --> 08:26.940]  Yeah, they're pitching it
[08:26.940 --> 08:30.700]  as like the equivalent of a privacy policy.
[08:30.700 --> 08:31.540]  Yeah.
[08:31.540 --> 08:32.380]  In their own words,
[08:32.380 --> 08:34.940]  while the latter describes in clear text
[08:34.940 --> 08:38.380]  which personal data is processed, stored, and passed on,
[08:38.380 --> 08:40.700]  the Internet Access Policy describes
[08:40.700 --> 08:42.500]  in machine-readable form
[08:42.500 --> 08:44.940]  which internet connections a program creates
[08:44.940 --> 08:47.460]  and for what purpose.
[08:47.460 --> 08:48.300]  Yeah.
[08:48.300 --> 08:50.100]  It sounds great, super plain language.
[08:50.980 --> 08:52.660]  I really, really would like to see
[08:52.660 --> 08:53.860]  more developers get behind this.
[08:53.860 --> 08:56.860]  I'd like to see Apple get behind something like this.
[08:56.860 --> 08:58.780]  I would, so I would like, on the first level,
[08:58.780 --> 09:00.100]  I would love for there just to be laws,
[09:00.100 --> 09:01.820]  like there should really be laws protecting us,
[09:01.820 --> 09:03.420]  data theft should be treated no differently
[09:03.420 --> 09:04.700]  than any other kind of theft.
[09:04.700 --> 09:05.980]  And if any, like I said in the video,
[09:05.980 --> 09:08.580]  if any startup CEO or developer
[09:08.580 --> 09:10.860]  even thinks about stealing this kind of information,
[09:10.860 --> 09:13.140]  they should wake up in a cold sweat, screaming,
[09:13.140 --> 09:14.700]  apologizing, and pulling out the code
[09:14.700 --> 09:16.540]  because they'll do real jail time.
[09:16.540 --> 09:18.140]  But that kind of stuff takes a long time.
[09:18.140 --> 09:21.620]  So in the meantime, if Will can find this stuff,
[09:21.620 --> 09:23.660]  Apple should implement, hire Will,
[09:23.660 --> 09:26.380]  or implement somebody to do this kind of stuff internally.
[09:26.380 --> 09:28.020]  And they should require right on that page
[09:28.020 --> 09:30.580]  where it says the compatibility for your app,
[09:30.580 --> 09:32.940]  what the age restrictions for your app should have.
[09:32.940 --> 09:34.580]  This is the personal data that we collect,
[09:34.580 --> 09:35.900]  and this is who we share it with.
[09:35.900 --> 09:38.060]  And if developers think that's gonna stop people
[09:38.060 --> 09:39.620]  from downloading, then they should reevaluate
[09:39.620 --> 09:40.740]  their business model.
[09:40.740 --> 09:41.780]  They shouldn't put anything on there
[09:41.780 --> 09:42.980]  that they're not proud of.
[09:42.980 --> 09:44.660]  There was something I should correct
[09:44.660 --> 09:45.780]  an episode or two ago.
[09:45.780 --> 09:49.500]  One of these ongoing scandals was about the framework,
[09:49.500 --> 09:50.460]  at least one, I don't know,
[09:50.460 --> 09:51.540]  I think it was a TechCrunch story,
[09:51.540 --> 09:54.860]  but basically that there's popular frameworks
[09:54.860 --> 09:59.220]  that apps use that record your screen activity
[09:59.220 --> 10:02.180]  ostensibly for the purposes of like A-B testing.
[10:02.180 --> 10:06.780]  And there's certainly good uses for that sort of thing.
[10:06.780 --> 10:09.420]  Like if you want to track what,
[10:10.420 --> 10:12.820]  see how people who first download your app
[10:12.820 --> 10:14.540]  go through the initial first run
[10:14.540 --> 10:16.820]  and what they tap on, where they stop.
[10:16.820 --> 10:21.580]  If 33% of the people stop at a certain point
[10:21.580 --> 10:23.220]  and never really come back to the app,
[10:23.220 --> 10:24.060]  that's good to know.
[10:24.060 --> 10:25.620]  Maybe you wanna revisit that.
[10:25.620 --> 10:27.340]  The problem is that they're doing this,
[10:27.340 --> 10:32.140]  these apps are doing this without any kind of permission.
[10:32.140 --> 10:34.900]  They're just collecting the data and sending it.
[10:34.900 --> 10:36.620]  I misspoke on the show and said that
[10:36.620 --> 10:39.980]  I was under the impression that it was just sending
[10:39.980 --> 10:44.980]  like sort of data, the tap on this position,
[10:46.420 --> 10:48.420]  this button was pressed,
[10:48.420 --> 10:50.340]  the screen was open for 20 seconds,
[10:50.340 --> 10:51.420]  that it wasn't like a movie,
[10:51.420 --> 10:55.060]  but I've been told no, it is a movie,
[10:55.060 --> 10:58.460]  that what gets sent back to the developer,
[10:58.460 --> 11:01.660]  you just hit the play button and they can just watch you
[11:01.660 --> 11:03.980]  as though they were recording your screen,
[11:03.980 --> 11:05.540]  as though you were taking a movie.
[11:05.540 --> 11:08.460]  They can see everything you did in there.
[11:08.460 --> 11:11.740]  And again, if you agree to it, fine.
[11:11.740 --> 11:14.460]  And what you were agreeing to
[11:14.460 --> 11:16.940]  was told to you in very plain language,
[11:16.940 --> 11:21.940]  not some kind of inscrutable 8-point type 5,000 word thing
[11:21.940 --> 11:26.380]  that you know everybody is going to skip past.
[11:26.380 --> 11:27.740]  Yeah, and I asked about this too,
[11:27.740 --> 11:29.580]  because almost all the apps that were caught doing this
[11:29.580 --> 11:34.300]  were like banking apps or big hospitality companies.
[11:34.300 --> 11:37.260]  And it seemed weird because every time you'd use those apps
[11:37.260 --> 11:39.420]  is making a server call and they know what you're hitting
[11:39.420 --> 11:40.620]  and when you're hitting it.
[11:40.620 --> 11:42.540]  But it was explained to me that they're just too,
[11:42.540 --> 11:43.980]  I don't know if lazy is the right word,
[11:43.980 --> 11:46.400]  but they were looking for an easy way to package that.
[11:46.400 --> 11:48.300]  And there are people that offered easy ways
[11:48.300 --> 11:49.980]  instead of them having to pull their server logs
[11:49.980 --> 11:53.220]  and hire someone to parse it for them and make it usable.
[11:53.220 --> 11:55.020]  They just threw in these frameworks
[11:55.020 --> 11:57.220]  that were making it easy for them.
[11:57.220 --> 11:59.900]  And it was good to see a bunch of developers say,
[11:59.900 --> 12:01.260]  we would never use these.
[12:01.260 --> 12:02.620]  Our job doesn't need to be easy.
[12:02.620 --> 12:04.620]  It needs to be done with respect for our customers.
[12:04.620 --> 12:07.860]  And we can do this without using those sketchy frameworks.
[12:07.860 --> 12:12.420]  It's just ridiculous how it just goes on and on and on.
[12:15.780 --> 12:18.180]  Facebook just said that they don't allow their developers
[12:18.180 --> 12:19.540]  to take anything without your permission.
[12:19.540 --> 12:21.100]  Google refused to comment
[12:21.100 --> 12:23.340]  and just the point of people at the policy.
[12:32.980 --> 12:34.780]  It's just such a pervasive.
[12:34.780 --> 12:38.080]  And I actually misused the word in a post
[12:38.080 --> 12:39.940]  on Daring Fireball a couple of days ago
[12:39.940 --> 12:43.660]  and then decided that I wanted to use pervasive,
[12:43.660 --> 12:44.780]  but I used perverted.
[12:44.780 --> 12:46.460]  And then I kept it when I edited it
[12:46.460 --> 12:48.140]  and made it pervasive and perverted.
[12:48.140 --> 12:53.140]  It really is a perverted attitude on privacy.
[12:54.980 --> 12:59.980]  And I really feel like I've been naive about this
[13:00.080 --> 13:00.920]  to a certain extent.
[13:00.920 --> 13:03.260]  Like I've kind of known that it's going on,
[13:03.260 --> 13:06.620]  but the more that comes out, the more I find myself,
[13:06.620 --> 13:10.980]  I think of myself as cynical and I don't really trust the,
[13:12.660 --> 13:14.500]  I have longstanding opposition
[13:14.500 --> 13:18.940]  to a lot of the ad tech industry, this whole idea
[13:18.940 --> 13:23.600]  of tech tracking and personalizing advertising.
[13:25.980 --> 13:29.940]  And even being a cynic on this front and being involved
[13:29.940 --> 13:32.300]  and supporting myself through advertising
[13:32.300 --> 13:37.300]  and in a very purposeful way, avoiding the privacy.
[13:37.300 --> 13:42.300]  The privacy, my whole career has been based on trying to do
[13:43.980 --> 13:47.460]  ad supported publishing and podcasting in a way
[13:47.460 --> 13:52.060]  that is 100% respectful of reader and listener privacy.
[13:52.060 --> 13:54.440]  Even as a cynic, I find myself almost staggered
[13:54.440 --> 13:59.440]  by the depths of it and this sort of default mentality,
[13:59.480 --> 14:03.100]  both from Facebook and Google, maybe lump Amazon
[14:03.100 --> 14:07.220]  with them too as the gorilla Titanic companies
[14:07.220 --> 14:10.700]  that are collecting these dossiers on people
[14:10.700 --> 14:15.700]  to all of the little fish, just the individual apps
[14:15.820 --> 14:20.820]  from 50, I mean, how many banks have apps in the app store?
[14:22.260 --> 14:25.660]  Hundreds, I'm sure probably thousands from around the world.
[14:25.660 --> 14:30.260]  How many of those apps are sending weird shit to the banks
[14:30.260 --> 14:32.120]  about what people are doing in the apps?
[14:32.120 --> 14:33.580]  Like why?
[14:33.580 --> 14:38.540]  And one of the worst parts is Google has a business
[14:38.540 --> 14:41.700]  like Facebook and data harvesting and a business like Apple
[14:41.700 --> 14:44.500]  in running an app marketplace and it's very hard
[14:44.500 --> 14:47.460]  to imagine Google doing what's best for customers
[14:47.460 --> 14:49.080]  and what's best for Google at the same time.
[14:49.080 --> 14:51.220]  They're almost divided against themselves
[14:51.220 --> 14:53.660]  and when Will was looking at the apps for Google,
[14:53.660 --> 14:56.500]  it was way harder to try to figure out what they were doing
[14:56.500 --> 14:57.820]  than the apps from iOS.
[14:57.820 --> 15:02.300]  You know, when Brent and Dave Whiskas and I
[15:02.300 --> 15:03.900]  were making Vesper, a notes app,
[15:03.900 --> 15:06.660]  and we were going to do our own sync,
[15:06.660 --> 15:09.640]  we were very cognizant that we have no idea
[15:09.640 --> 15:10.860]  what people are putting in their notes.
[15:10.860 --> 15:11.920]  We don't wanna know.
[15:11.920 --> 15:14.620]  We wanna set this up in a way where we can't know.
[15:14.620 --> 15:17.340]  You know, there was no view that we had
[15:17.340 --> 15:19.020]  where we could look at the notes,
[15:19.020 --> 15:24.020]  the notes restored, you know, encrypted on the server.
[15:24.260 --> 15:26.180]  But you know, it's just a silly little notes app
[15:26.180 --> 15:27.460]  that we were selling for four bucks
[15:27.460 --> 15:28.880]  but we figured, you know, who knows?
[15:28.880 --> 15:30.740]  People could write anything and everything in a notes app.
[15:30.740 --> 15:31.580]  So we need to-
[15:31.580 --> 15:32.420]  The most important thing in their lives
[15:32.420 --> 15:33.240]  could be in that note.
[15:33.240 --> 15:34.180]  Right, we take it, you know,
[15:34.180 --> 15:37.780]  let's be very deliberate every step of the way.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.820]  I can't help but think, like if you were working on a team
[15:41.820 --> 15:45.700]  that was making a period tracker for women,
[15:45.700 --> 15:48.300]  you have to recognize instantly
[15:48.300 --> 15:50.560]  that this is super private information.
[15:50.560 --> 15:53.100]  This is super personal, you know,
[15:53.100 --> 15:57.980]  hard to get more personal than a woman's health.
[15:59.520 --> 16:01.880]  You would just think every step of the way,
[16:01.880 --> 16:03.340]  let's not screw up.
[16:03.340 --> 16:04.860]  Like that's what we were thinking with Vesper
[16:04.860 --> 16:08.060]  is how, you know, let's follow, you know,
[16:08.060 --> 16:11.100]  all the best practices we can, let's be cautious.
[16:11.100 --> 16:13.220]  I mean, and I say we, Brent really was the one
[16:13.220 --> 16:15.200]  who designed and built the sync service
[16:15.200 --> 16:17.140]  but we were all on board with, okay, Brent,
[16:17.140 --> 16:18.340]  take your time and, you know,
[16:18.340 --> 16:23.140]  do this in a very cautious, deliberately err on the side
[16:23.140 --> 16:27.000]  of, you know, let's make sure this is as solid as possible.
[16:27.000 --> 16:29.060]  That's just thinking about mistakes, bugs,
[16:29.060 --> 16:30.640]  like, oh my God, we screwed up
[16:30.640 --> 16:33.660]  and we exposed personal information through blank.
[16:33.660 --> 16:36.020]  Accidentally, we're horrified, let's do, you know,
[16:36.020 --> 16:38.260]  let's fix it, let's tell everybody,
[16:38.260 --> 16:40.640]  let's get in front of this, whatever.
[16:43.060 --> 16:44.960]  That's the mentality you would just like to think
[16:44.960 --> 16:46.400]  that everybody has but on the other hand,
[16:46.400 --> 16:48.580]  here's these companies that it's not mistakes,
[16:48.580 --> 16:50.620]  it's purposeful, it's let's include
[16:50.620 --> 16:52.820]  this Facebook analytic package in that's going
[16:52.820 --> 16:55.420]  to instantly send all of this data to Facebook.
[16:55.420 --> 16:57.300]  Like the mentality behind that,
[16:57.300 --> 16:59.880]  doing that clearly on purpose, right?
[16:59.880 --> 17:03.080]  You don't accidentally include a Facebook analytics
[17:03.080 --> 17:07.580]  framework in your app and have it wired up to, you know,
[17:07.580 --> 17:12.500]  the data, it's, I really feel like it is hard
[17:12.500 --> 17:17.500]  to overstate the outrage that we collectively should have
[17:18.900 --> 17:23.900]  and like you said, that our lawmakers across the globe
[17:23.900 --> 17:27.840]  should have about getting on top of this.
[17:27.840 --> 17:29.880]  And frankly, like again, it's hard to expect Google
[17:29.880 --> 17:31.780]  to do anything because they're conflicted on this
[17:31.780 --> 17:35.780]  but Apple, if you talk to the face ID team, for example,
[17:35.780 --> 17:37.300]  it wasn't like let's make face ID
[17:37.300 --> 17:38.760]  and then we'll figure out how to make it private.
[17:38.760 --> 17:40.540]  It's like you are not allowed to make face ID
[17:40.540 --> 17:42.980]  unless every step along the way
[17:42.980 --> 17:45.860]  has been carefully considered for preserving privacy.
[17:45.860 --> 17:48.280]  And that's not just face ID, that's everything they build.
[17:48.280 --> 17:51.360]  And the same thing needs to be applied to the app store,
[17:51.360 --> 17:52.860]  you know, especially because I, again,
[17:52.860 --> 17:54.140]  I don't think Google is going to do it.
[17:54.140 --> 17:55.860]  And if Apple is making this their, you know,
[17:55.860 --> 17:59.060]  top down front facing most important feature,
[17:59.060 --> 18:02.200]  then they've got to do that throughout their stack.
[18:02.200 --> 18:04.660]  It's the way everything is monetized too.
[18:04.660 --> 18:08.800]  Like the way that these apps are all free and it's,
[18:08.800 --> 18:11.380]  and I know there's- Free as in your data.
[18:11.380 --> 18:14.580]  Yeah, and there's the Tim Cook line that he loves a lot,
[18:14.580 --> 18:18.980]  which is if you're not the paying customer,
[18:18.980 --> 18:21.580]  you're the, what's the, all right, I'm-
[18:21.580 --> 18:22.420]  You're the product.
[18:22.420 --> 18:24.160]  You're the product, right.
[18:24.160 --> 18:25.340]  And there's truth to that.
[18:25.340 --> 18:27.980]  And I realize it doesn't apply in every way,
[18:27.980 --> 18:31.800]  but there is a problem with expecting all this stuff
[18:31.800 --> 18:33.860]  to be free and that they're selling,
[18:33.860 --> 18:36.900]  you're exchanging your privacy instead of your money
[18:36.900 --> 18:38.600]  for these products and services.
[18:38.600 --> 18:42.620]  And I think that people are starting to catch onto this.
[18:42.620 --> 18:46.180]  And I really feel like the industry has spent,
[18:46.180 --> 18:48.460]  it's not just like an app era thing.
[18:48.460 --> 18:50.340]  It's really an internet era thing.
[18:50.340 --> 18:53.180]  It, you know, it goes to, you know,
[18:53.180 --> 18:55.300]  to the whole use of the web
[18:55.300 --> 18:56.940]  and how many websites have been free
[18:56.940 --> 18:59.480]  and the tracking goes back to the origins
[18:59.480 --> 19:01.260]  of ads on the internet.
[19:03.900 --> 19:05.160]  And famously, you know,
[19:05.160 --> 19:09.640]  people don't like to pay for digital stuff, right?
[19:09.640 --> 19:11.300]  People, you know, famously, you know,
[19:11.300 --> 19:15.820]  they'll spend $1,100 on a phone
[19:15.820 --> 19:20.420]  and then balk at spending $2 on a game for the phone.
[19:22.260 --> 19:25.500]  But I feel like people are starting to wake up
[19:25.500 --> 19:27.440]  to the fact that this stuff isn't really free,
[19:27.440 --> 19:30.380]  that there's something being lost in the exchange here
[19:30.380 --> 19:35.380]  and that the extraordinary just lack of respect
[19:38.540 --> 19:40.900]  that these companies have for customer privacy
[19:40.900 --> 19:45.900]  is really starting to burst out of the,
[19:47.300 --> 19:48.740]  oh, that's just inside baseball
[19:48.740 --> 19:51.260]  and break into the mainstream conversation
[19:51.260 --> 19:53.260]  about how we live our lives
[19:53.260 --> 19:54.900]  in this ever more digital world.
[19:56.860 --> 19:58.140]  Yeah, I think that's absolutely true.
[19:58.140 --> 20:00.420]  And again, humans just psychologically,
[20:00.420 --> 20:01.380]  evolutionarily speaking,
[20:01.380 --> 20:04.300]  we are tuned to think about the present and not the future.
[20:04.300 --> 20:05.740]  And almost all the time,
[20:05.740 --> 20:07.620]  we will mortgage our future for the present.
[20:07.620 --> 20:09.980]  And these are so good at doing that
[20:09.980 --> 20:11.480]  because you think, oh, it's free.
[20:11.480 --> 20:13.160]  You don't see data the way you see time,
[20:13.160 --> 20:14.000]  the way you see money,
[20:14.000 --> 20:15.660]  you don't feel it leaving your wallet.
[20:15.660 --> 20:18.260]  And everybody is data rich, it's a great equalizer.
[20:18.260 --> 20:19.860]  Different people have different kinds of money,
[20:19.860 --> 20:22.420]  different amounts of time, different amounts of money,
[20:22.420 --> 20:25.940]  but we all have invaluable data for these companies
[20:25.940 --> 20:29.300]  and they will happily take as much as we will give
[20:29.300 --> 20:31.420]  in exchange for what we think are free products,
[20:31.420 --> 20:34.300]  but are really front ends for data harvesting services.
[20:34.300 --> 20:36.060]  I use this analogy all the time
[20:36.060 --> 20:40.140]  that we wouldn't tolerate in the real world,
[20:40.140 --> 20:42.100]  but we tolerate online,
[20:42.100 --> 20:47.100]  like where you go shopping for a pair of boots in a store,
[20:47.220 --> 20:50.920]  and then all of a sudden every tab in your browser
[20:50.920 --> 20:52.900]  has ads for brown boots.
[20:52.900 --> 20:56.060]  We wouldn't tolerate it in the real world.
[20:56.060 --> 20:58.980]  If you went into a shoe store in the real world
[20:58.980 --> 21:00.180]  and looked at a pair of boots,
[21:00.180 --> 21:01.220]  can thought about them and thought,
[21:01.220 --> 21:02.260]  you know what, I'm not going to buy these,
[21:02.260 --> 21:03.700]  and you walk down the street.
[21:03.700 --> 21:05.220]  If somebody from the store followed you
[21:05.220 --> 21:07.200]  or somebody from a boot company followed you
[21:07.200 --> 21:08.820]  and started asking you,
[21:08.820 --> 21:10.700]  hey, how about these boots?
[21:10.700 --> 21:14.740]  How about we go into Macy's and look for boots?
[21:14.740 --> 21:16.200]  Macy's has a sale on boots.
[21:17.200 --> 21:18.820]  You'd be so creeped out.
[21:18.820 --> 21:23.820]  It would, you know, you'd be, you know, you'd object.
[21:25.120 --> 21:26.660]  You know, you would be like,
[21:26.660 --> 21:28.300]  you wouldn't just tolerate it, right?
[21:28.300 --> 21:30.860]  You'd freak out in a way.
[21:30.860 --> 21:33.260]  And yet that's how everything happens online.
[21:34.140 --> 21:35.940]  Yeah, if any of this stuff was made manifest,
[21:35.940 --> 21:37.460]  I think we talked about this last time.
[21:37.460 --> 21:40.040]  If you were forced to see all your nudie pics
[21:40.040 --> 21:41.700]  and all your personal health data
[21:41.700 --> 21:44.340]  go into a literal representation of these servers,
[21:44.340 --> 21:46.880]  you'd be aghast, but it's all invisible to you.
[21:46.880 --> 21:48.900]  There's no real, there's no perceived cost.
[21:48.900 --> 21:51.960]  Yeah, it's really, I don't know.
[21:53.580 --> 21:55.340]  Where do you think this is going with Facebook?
[21:55.340 --> 21:57.780]  And on the app store, like here's,
[21:57.780 --> 21:58.900]  I think you agree with me,
[21:58.900 --> 22:01.540]  but I'm curious to hear your thoughts.
[22:01.540 --> 22:06.540]  I feel like, okay, Apple actually is on the right in this,
[22:07.100 --> 22:09.580]  that they really do,
[22:12.320 --> 22:15.940]  they really do want to protect customers' privacy,
[22:15.940 --> 22:18.580]  and they really don't want to collect this stuff themselves.
[22:18.580 --> 22:22.920]  But I think at least even though they're not doing it
[22:22.920 --> 22:24.500]  and they're not condoning it,
[22:25.820 --> 22:28.260]  it's happening in apps that are going through their store.
[22:28.260 --> 22:30.380]  And so I do feel like they bear
[22:30.380 --> 22:35.220]  a certain responsibility for this and for addressing it.
[22:35.220 --> 22:37.940]  Yeah, absolutely.
[22:37.940 --> 22:39.480]  Again, I think it's a triple phase approach.
[22:39.480 --> 22:41.440]  I think ultimately there has to be regulation.
[22:41.440 --> 22:42.800]  Until there's regulation,
[22:42.800 --> 22:44.380]  it defaults down to the platforms,
[22:44.380 --> 22:46.420]  Microsoft, Apple, and Google.
[22:46.420 --> 22:49.940]  And again, pointing out that Google's conflicted on this.
[22:49.940 --> 22:51.380]  What I would love Apple to do
[22:51.380 --> 22:53.380]  is to require the privacy disclosure
[22:53.380 --> 22:54.660]  to be on the product page,
[22:54.660 --> 22:56.480]  and then to do exactly what Will does
[22:56.480 --> 22:57.940]  and sniff the products to make sure
[22:57.940 --> 22:59.460]  that what they're disclosing
[22:59.460 --> 23:01.240]  is the same as what's on the page.
[23:01.240 --> 23:03.220]  And if it's not, they reject them.
[23:03.220 --> 23:04.640]  And if it's malicious,
[23:04.640 --> 23:06.700]  they do what they've done with other violators,
[23:06.700 --> 23:08.840]  and that is delete their developer accounts.
[23:08.840 --> 23:10.280]  And that will create an environment
[23:10.280 --> 23:11.420]  where this sort of behavior,
[23:11.420 --> 23:13.660]  like this sort of behavior, we become normalized to it.
[23:13.660 --> 23:15.900]  Like, it just seems like it's what everybody does.
[23:15.900 --> 23:19.100]  It's desensitizing because there's a new scandal every day.
[23:19.100 --> 23:20.340]  And the only way to stop that
[23:20.340 --> 23:22.060]  is to start doing things that are severe,
[23:22.060 --> 23:25.460]  things that force you to wake up and pay attention.
[23:25.460 --> 23:26.620]  And I feel like if Apple,
[23:26.620 --> 23:28.580]  Apple's the only one in any position to do this,
[23:28.580 --> 23:29.940]  because I'm not really sure
[23:29.940 --> 23:32.340]  what the state of the Windows market is right now,
[23:32.340 --> 23:34.060]  and Google probably will never do this,
[23:34.060 --> 23:36.140]  at least not if Apple doesn't do it first.
[23:36.140 --> 23:37.100]  But they're in a real position
[23:37.100 --> 23:39.300]  to set the same standard for these apps
[23:39.300 --> 23:41.500]  that they're setting for themselves internally.
[23:41.500 --> 23:43.100]  And then things like what you pointed out
[23:43.100 --> 23:44.380]  with the little snitch company
[23:44.380 --> 23:46.260]  to help developers who are doing this
[23:46.260 --> 23:48.040]  get the recognition that they deserve
[23:48.040 --> 23:50.660]  and to get our confidence as customers.
[23:50.660 --> 23:52.260]  And until those things happen,
[23:52.260 --> 23:54.720]  companies are gonna keep doing this because it's easy.
[23:54.720 --> 23:58.300]  They get bribed and extorted
[23:58.300 --> 24:00.660]  by the Googles and the Facebooks to include this stuff,
[24:00.660 --> 24:02.700]  and they get benefits from doing it.
[24:02.700 --> 24:06.000]  It feeds both their laziness and their finances,
[24:06.000 --> 24:09.140]  so they're gonna keep doing it until someone stops them.
[24:09.140 --> 24:13.380]  Yeah, but I really do feel like Apple has to,
[24:13.380 --> 24:16.540]  they need to act quicker than legislation is going to happen.
[24:16.540 --> 24:17.840]  They can't just stand behind and say,
[24:17.840 --> 24:19.760]  well, this stuff is legal.
[24:21.220 --> 24:23.020]  I'm not quite sure what that is,
[24:23.020 --> 24:23.900]  but I think you're right, though,
[24:23.900 --> 24:26.140]  that part of it would be having,
[24:26.140 --> 24:29.280]  taking like what Straphic does
[24:29.280 --> 24:34.280]  and make it part of the review process.
[24:35.060 --> 24:37.060]  It's probably not simple enough.
[24:37.060 --> 24:39.860]  I mean, with some of this stuff like the screen recording,
[24:40.780 --> 24:42.200]  once the story broke,
[24:43.180 --> 24:45.340]  because there's a known list
[24:45.340 --> 24:49.380]  of these analytics frameworks that supply it,
[24:49.380 --> 24:51.820]  they could automate the process
[24:51.820 --> 24:56.620]  of looking through all the thousands and thousands of apps
[24:56.620 --> 24:59.360]  in the App Store and finding apps that have these frameworks
[24:59.360 --> 25:03.540]  and a lot of these apps got like,
[25:03.540 --> 25:04.620]  the developers got like a,
[25:04.620 --> 25:07.860]  hey, you've got three days to remove X, Y, and Z
[25:07.860 --> 25:10.700]  from your app or it's gonna be taken out of the App Store.
[25:12.160 --> 25:14.780]  So they obviously have that capability.
[25:14.780 --> 25:16.580]  It's kind of cool that they could do that,
[25:16.580 --> 25:18.100]  but it's not enough,
[25:18.100 --> 25:21.260]  like they don't wanna get into a situation of whack-a-mole
[25:21.260 --> 25:23.980]  where, okay, now we know we have to change the name
[25:23.980 --> 25:26.380]  of the framework and make it custom,
[25:26.380 --> 25:29.140]  hide it from the App Store review team.
[25:31.060 --> 25:32.380]  They don't wanna go down that path.
[25:32.380 --> 25:34.780]  I think the thing that they can monitor
[25:34.780 --> 25:37.280]  is actually looking at the network calls
[25:37.280 --> 25:39.260]  that are going out of the app and where they're going.
[25:39.260 --> 25:40.660]  There's no way to hide that.
[25:40.660 --> 25:42.620]  I mean, they can't necessarily see within them
[25:42.620 --> 25:45.420]  because hopefully all those calls are using SSL
[25:45.420 --> 25:47.060]  so they're encrypted, but they can at least see
[25:47.060 --> 25:49.460]  which servers are being notified.
[25:49.460 --> 25:50.380]  Yeah, which is what Will did.
[25:50.380 --> 25:52.780]  He pulled out like the Google Analytics data.
[25:52.780 --> 25:55.180]  There was that case of Uber saying don't do this
[25:55.180 --> 25:56.660]  if you're in the vicinity of Cupertino,
[25:56.660 --> 25:58.020]  but they still got caught.
[25:58.020 --> 25:59.700]  And to me, that would be the malicious part
[25:59.700 --> 26:01.540]  that just gets your account deleted.
[26:01.540 --> 26:05.460]  I mean, obviously the rules are different when you're Uber,
[26:05.460 --> 26:06.700]  and this drives some people crazy
[26:06.700 --> 26:09.460]  because they feel like Facebook and Google and Uber
[26:09.460 --> 26:11.740]  get special treatment, and they do the same way.
[26:11.740 --> 26:13.540]  Like America will respond to China differently
[26:13.540 --> 26:17.100]  than it'll respond to some very small country.
[26:19.180 --> 26:22.060]  And a lot of people use and depend on these services.
[26:22.060 --> 26:23.820]  And in essence, you have the web.
[26:23.820 --> 26:25.900]  So if you ever wanted to get rid of the Facebook app,
[26:25.900 --> 26:28.260]  people could still log into Facebook on Safari.
[26:28.260 --> 26:31.120]  So I think it has to go beyond just looking at it
[26:31.120 --> 26:32.260]  from the punitive sense.
[26:32.260 --> 26:35.140]  It has to be really fixing this problem.
[26:37.100 --> 26:39.180]  Well, it's an ongoing saga.
[26:41.420 --> 26:42.740]  All right, let me take a break
[26:42.740 --> 26:44.900]  and thank our first sponsor.
[26:44.900 --> 26:45.720]  It's a new sponsor.
[26:45.720 --> 26:46.560]  I love this company.
[26:46.560 --> 26:47.420]  It's really, really neat.
[26:47.420 --> 26:49.040]  It's called Marine Layer.
[26:49.040 --> 26:52.140]  Like marine, like water, Marine Layer.
[26:52.140 --> 26:56.660]  Marine Layer makes clothing, casual,
[26:56.660 --> 26:59.780]  stuff like sweatshirts and pullovers and T-shirts
[26:59.780 --> 27:01.620]  for men and women.
[27:01.620 --> 27:04.060]  They make their own fabric.
[27:04.060 --> 27:06.500]  They've really started from the ground up.
[27:06.500 --> 27:09.740]  And they really talked about the word soft
[27:09.740 --> 27:13.740]  and their stuff is so very soft.
[27:13.740 --> 27:15.700]  Really, really soft T-shirts.
[27:15.700 --> 27:19.140]  It's really kind of amazing and really stylish, very cool.
[27:19.140 --> 27:21.060]  Lots of stuff to choose from.
[27:21.060 --> 27:22.660]  It's not like, oh, this feels nice soft.
[27:22.660 --> 27:24.700]  It's just like, holy shit, how did they make this?
[27:24.700 --> 27:26.700]  I'm never taking it off soft.
[27:26.700 --> 27:28.940]  And it turns out one of the ways they did this
[27:28.940 --> 27:31.700]  by making their fabric is that they make them from trees.
[27:31.700 --> 27:32.940]  It's called Micro Modal
[27:32.940 --> 27:35.900]  and it's found in Marine Soft's signature fabric
[27:35.900 --> 27:38.940]  and it's made from recycled beechwood.
[27:38.940 --> 27:41.620]  The pulp production is self-sufficient,
[27:41.620 --> 27:44.500]  which makes their teas sustainable, eco-friendly,
[27:44.500 --> 27:47.700]  and as I said, soft.
[27:47.700 --> 27:50.580]  They also have some really cool stuff for sizing
[27:50.580 --> 27:53.660]  where they have in-between sizes that they call like Marge,
[27:53.660 --> 27:56.600]  which is in between medium and large and larger,
[27:56.600 --> 27:57.960]  which is bigger than large,
[27:57.960 --> 28:00.080]  but smaller than extra large.
[28:00.080 --> 28:02.780]  For people who just don't conform to standard sizes,
[28:02.780 --> 28:05.260]  they have an insanely good return policy.
[28:05.260 --> 28:08.260]  You can return pretty much anything for up to a year
[28:08.260 --> 28:10.100]  and they stand by their clothes
[28:10.100 --> 28:11.980]  and they offer free shipping and free returns
[28:11.980 --> 28:13.620]  on all US orders.
[28:13.620 --> 28:15.580]  Wow, that's really great.
[28:15.580 --> 28:16.420]  Here's the deal.
[28:16.420 --> 28:19.420]  They've got quality product, lots of selection,
[28:19.420 --> 28:23.300]  really, really soft fabric, really comfortable,
[28:23.300 --> 28:26.980]  great customer experience with free shipping and returns.
[28:26.980 --> 28:28.820]  So here's what you do.
[28:28.820 --> 28:30.740]  You get 15% off your first order.
[28:30.740 --> 28:33.460]  That's a special deal for listeners of the show.
[28:33.460 --> 28:37.820]  Go to marinelayer.com and enter the promo code TTS
[28:39.780 --> 28:40.940]  at checkout.
[28:40.940 --> 28:44.260]  That's promo code TTS for the talk show
[28:44.260 --> 28:47.580]  and that gets you 15% off your first order
[28:47.580 --> 28:50.760]  at marinelayer.com.
[28:50.760 --> 28:51.900]  Absolutely great stuff.
[28:53.020 --> 28:55.360]  All right, here's something I've been thinking about.
[28:55.360 --> 28:58.600]  So, and I don't think I've talked about it on the show
[28:58.600 --> 29:01.200]  and if I have, I've blacked out and forgotten it.
[29:02.960 --> 29:05.920]  There is an Apple privacy related,
[29:10.020 --> 29:12.060]  the elephant in the room
[29:12.060 --> 29:15.580]  and it ties into Apple's services narrative
[29:15.580 --> 29:17.860]  and that look at our services revenue
[29:17.860 --> 29:19.860]  is growing, growing, growing.
[29:19.860 --> 29:23.620]  And the basic gist is,
[29:23.620 --> 29:26.580]  hey, of these big five companies,
[29:26.580 --> 29:31.580]  especially Google and Facebook, maybe lump Amazon in,
[29:31.620 --> 29:33.900]  these guys are doing sketchy stuff with your privacy.
[29:33.900 --> 29:36.620]  We're not, we're Apple, we're not doing it.
[29:36.620 --> 29:38.480]  The elephant in the room is the money
[29:38.480 --> 29:40.980]  that Apple gets from Google
[29:40.980 --> 29:45.420]  for making Google search the default in Safari
[29:45.420 --> 29:50.420]  across the Mac and let's face it, in particular iOS.
[29:50.420 --> 29:55.420]  It's, I think it's Goldman Sachs who did some work on this
[29:57.420 --> 30:01.600]  and estimated it at like 8 billion for 2018.
[30:03.100 --> 30:04.820]  And I think that they estimate that it might go up
[30:04.820 --> 30:07.840]  to like 12 billion for 2019.
[30:09.300 --> 30:12.580]  That's a lot of money and it's a fairly high,
[30:12.580 --> 30:13.840]  it's a lot of money period, right?
[30:13.840 --> 30:15.220]  We're talking $12 billion.
[30:15.220 --> 30:17.640]  That's, I mean, that's by anybody's standards,
[30:17.640 --> 30:20.540]  even Apple and Google, that's a lot of money.
[30:20.540 --> 30:25.140]  It's also a big chunk of Apple's services revenue.
[30:25.140 --> 30:28.920]  Like a big chunk of Apple's services revenue is,
[30:30.860 --> 30:33.140]  and I'm not gonna say they don't have to do anything,
[30:33.140 --> 30:35.860]  but effectively, yeah, just keeping Google
[30:35.860 --> 30:38.180]  as the default search engine in Safari.
[30:38.180 --> 30:43.180]  So all of this stuff with Apple Music and with iCloud
[30:43.240 --> 30:46.220]  and with their upcoming video service,
[30:46.220 --> 30:50.880]  with their supposedly upcoming subscription news service
[30:50.880 --> 30:54.780]  and anything else that would be filed under the,
[30:54.780 --> 30:56.580]  look at all these new initiatives we have
[30:56.580 --> 30:57.900]  to increase services revenue.
[30:57.900 --> 30:59.100]  A big chunk of the money just comes
[30:59.100 --> 31:02.700]  from making Google the default search engine.
[31:02.700 --> 31:06.860]  And the privacy angle on this is how can we say
[31:06.860 --> 31:10.560]  that Google has problems, is a problematic company
[31:10.560 --> 31:13.460]  in terms of respecting people's privacy
[31:13.460 --> 31:18.460]  while Apple is pocketing $10 billion a year?
[31:19.580 --> 31:21.780]  Like where do they think that money is coming from?
[31:21.780 --> 31:26.220]  Yeah, yeah, no, I did a video on this too,
[31:26.220 --> 31:27.540]  but there was a whole bunch of things
[31:27.540 --> 31:30.700]  that people say that, like there's the China situation
[31:30.700 --> 31:32.140]  and there's just several of these.
[31:32.140 --> 31:36.300]  And the one that you cannot justify is Google.
[31:36.300 --> 31:39.380]  Now I've used DuckDuckGo because of the issues I have
[31:39.380 --> 31:41.280]  with Google and it's simply not as good.
[31:41.280 --> 31:42.740]  And that's Apple's overall point
[31:42.740 --> 31:45.060]  is that Google is the best search engine.
[31:45.060 --> 31:46.820]  But once, if Apple just chose it
[31:46.820 --> 31:47.940]  and it wasn't getting paid for it,
[31:47.940 --> 31:49.820]  that's an easy position to defend.
[31:49.820 --> 31:51.340]  Google is the best search engine still.
[31:51.340 --> 31:52.980]  We understand there's problems with it,
[31:52.980 --> 31:54.700]  but we believe it's the best for our customers.
[31:54.700 --> 31:57.280]  So we're using it and there's no money changing hands.
[31:57.280 --> 31:58.640]  The minute the money changes hands,
[31:58.640 --> 32:00.300]  then it's impossible to say
[32:00.300 --> 32:02.140]  whether it's the best or not anymore.
[32:03.220 --> 32:05.980]  If I had my druthers, there would be a box that pops up
[32:05.980 --> 32:07.220]  because you can change it.
[32:07.220 --> 32:08.580]  It's not like it's the only search engine.
[32:08.580 --> 32:11.240]  You can go into Safari settings and choose DuckDuckGo
[32:11.240 --> 32:12.820]  or Yahoo or Microsoft.
[32:12.820 --> 32:15.580]  Don't know why they're still in there, but you can.
[32:15.580 --> 32:17.680]  But if I had my druthers, the first time,
[32:17.680 --> 32:20.400]  the first run experience for Safari would pop up,
[32:20.400 --> 32:22.000]  which search engine do you wanna use?
[32:22.000 --> 32:25.020]  And if people tap on Google because they prefer the results
[32:25.020 --> 32:28.340]  and they understand what comes with them, that's great.
[32:28.340 --> 32:30.780]  If they have concerns, they can tap DuckDuckGo
[32:30.780 --> 32:31.640]  and that's great too.
[32:31.640 --> 32:34.360]  And maybe people who work at Microsoft could tap on Bing,
[32:34.360 --> 32:38.540]  but whatever, you'd have a conscious user decision to do it.
[32:38.540 --> 32:40.180]  And Google could even pay them a bounty
[32:40.180 --> 32:41.740]  for every person who taps on Google
[32:41.740 --> 32:42.980]  if they really wanted to.
[32:42.980 --> 32:44.420]  But to me, that's sort of,
[32:44.420 --> 32:46.860]  once you make privacy your distinguishing feature,
[32:46.860 --> 32:48.860]  you've set the bar much higher.
[32:48.860 --> 32:51.180]  Because I think Firefox famously gets almost all their money
[32:51.180 --> 32:53.280]  from Google as well, which is super ironic,
[32:53.280 --> 32:55.020]  giving Firefox the statements.
[32:55.020 --> 32:56.080]  And Apple previously would say,
[32:56.080 --> 32:57.560]  yeah, we use Google as a default,
[32:57.560 --> 32:59.700]  but we do everything we can to deny them information
[32:59.700 --> 33:02.860]  with do not track and with providing garbage input
[33:02.860 --> 33:04.580]  into the machine tracking
[33:04.580 --> 33:08.020]  and by killing all the social plugins and killing the ads.
[33:08.020 --> 33:09.740]  And that might be true.
[33:09.740 --> 33:11.900]  They're still taking all the money.
[33:11.900 --> 33:14.820]  And they do some stuff
[33:14.820 --> 33:18.660]  that I would think Google would prefer.
[33:18.660 --> 33:21.880]  They didn't, like when you're in Safari
[33:21.880 --> 33:26.880]  and you start typing in the magic search or URL field,
[33:27.900 --> 33:31.500]  they have sometimes, depending on what you type,
[33:32.780 --> 33:34.540]  suggested results that aren't
[33:34.540 --> 33:36.660]  from your search engine provider,
[33:36.660 --> 33:40.260]  that Apple is somehow guessing what it is.
[33:40.260 --> 33:42.220]  It's like the top item sometimes,
[33:43.660 --> 33:46.020]  I guess they call them Siri suggestions, right?
[33:50.100 --> 33:51.560]  But for the most part,
[33:51.560 --> 33:53.100]  a lot of the stuff that goes through that field
[33:53.100 --> 33:55.200]  goes through Google.
[33:58.780 --> 34:00.020]  There's so many negotiations
[34:00.020 --> 34:01.720]  that I would love to be a fly on the wall for it.
[34:01.720 --> 34:05.100]  That is one that must be fascinating to me
[34:05.100 --> 34:07.460]  because Apple's obviously,
[34:07.460 --> 34:11.360]  I mean, if we take Goldman Sachs' numbers,
[34:11.360 --> 34:13.300]  and I think I would probably wager
[34:13.300 --> 34:16.180]  that if they're not spot on, they're close enough,
[34:16.180 --> 34:21.180]  that it was somewhere between 12 billion 2018 and 2019.
[34:21.800 --> 34:24.280]  They're obviously getting a lot of money from Google.
[34:24.280 --> 34:25.120]  But on the other hand,
[34:25.120 --> 34:27.980]  Google is coming at this from a very strong position
[34:27.980 --> 34:30.420]  of strength in terms of, well, what are you gonna do?
[34:30.420 --> 34:34.180]  Are you really gonna make Bing the default search engine?
[34:34.180 --> 34:35.580]  Are you really gonna make DuckDuckGo
[34:35.580 --> 34:37.380]  the default search engine?
[34:37.380 --> 34:38.220]  Come on.
[34:40.940 --> 34:42.760]  It would be worth a lot more.
[34:42.760 --> 34:43.860]  I think about this.
[34:43.860 --> 34:46.660]  If it's worth roughly 10 billion a year now,
[34:46.660 --> 34:49.340]  imagine what it would be worth in a world
[34:49.340 --> 34:52.180]  where there were two or three search engines
[34:52.180 --> 34:57.180]  that were arguably of equal quality.
[34:57.180 --> 34:58.020]  Really competitive.
[34:58.020 --> 34:59.780]  Right, what if Bing results
[34:59.780 --> 35:04.220]  really were indistinguishable from Google search results?
[35:05.380 --> 35:07.220]  I suspect, I don't know,
[35:07.220 --> 35:11.160]  and I suppose that they could prepare for this in advance.
[35:11.160 --> 35:13.900]  It wouldn't be sprung on them at the last moment.
[35:13.900 --> 35:18.740]  But I would wager heavily that Apple couldn't make,
[35:18.740 --> 35:21.060]  like flip a switch tomorrow and make DuckDuckGo
[35:21.060 --> 35:22.060]  the default search engine,
[35:22.060 --> 35:23.860]  that DuckDuckGo wouldn't be able to handle
[35:23.860 --> 35:26.220]  that sudden increase in traffic.
[35:27.800 --> 35:29.380]  And you can't really do that.
[35:29.380 --> 35:33.140]  This is part of Google's strength in negotiating, too,
[35:33.140 --> 35:38.140]  is with so many hundreds of millions of iOS users.
[35:39.500 --> 35:42.000]  I mean, what does Apple estimate as the user base?
[35:42.000 --> 35:43.860]  Is it up to a billion yet?
[35:43.860 --> 35:46.660]  I mean, I think it's a billion devices,
[35:46.660 --> 35:47.940]  maybe not a billion people,
[35:47.940 --> 35:50.600]  but it's hundreds of millions of people, clearly.
[35:51.660 --> 35:53.260]  In some way, I'm not gonna say can't.
[35:53.260 --> 35:55.180]  Can't is, obviously they could,
[35:55.180 --> 35:57.260]  but it would be very difficult
[35:57.260 --> 36:00.060]  to change the default on people
[36:00.060 --> 36:03.140]  just when they upgrade the OS, right?
[36:03.140 --> 36:04.660]  When you upgrade to iOS,
[36:06.960 --> 36:09.540]  I guess it'll be 14 this year, or is it 13?
[36:09.540 --> 36:10.740]  I even did it intentionally.
[36:10.740 --> 36:12.620]  What number do we have?
[36:12.620 --> 36:13.460]  13.
[36:13.460 --> 36:14.280]  But I switched to DuckDuckGo,
[36:14.280 --> 36:15.620]  and the first time I used it,
[36:15.620 --> 36:17.500]  I didn't recognize the search page results.
[36:17.500 --> 36:18.340]  Right.
[36:18.340 --> 36:19.160]  No.
[36:19.160 --> 36:20.000]  It's just been very confusing.
[36:20.000 --> 36:23.260]  Yeah, and there's an awful lot of people,
[36:23.260 --> 36:27.280]  and it really gets to the, you know,
[36:27.280 --> 36:29.240]  people aren't supposed to be technical experts.
[36:29.240 --> 36:33.800]  That's the whole, you know, Apple way of, you know,
[36:33.800 --> 36:36.440]  that's been Apple's motto from the get-go.
[36:37.700 --> 36:42.700]  But Google's role, Google Search's role on the internet
[36:42.920 --> 36:45.720]  is if you know how the web works,
[36:45.720 --> 36:49.340]  and you know how to build a website,
[36:49.340 --> 36:51.420]  and you basically know,
[36:51.420 --> 36:53.260]  you don't have to be able to write a search engine,
[36:53.260 --> 36:56.540]  but if you basically know it's just a simple form,
[36:56.540 --> 36:59.200]  you type words, you hit the button,
[36:59.200 --> 37:00.820]  and then it goes to the server,
[37:00.820 --> 37:04.800]  and the server takes that query and makes its best guess
[37:04.800 --> 37:07.620]  as to what it is you're looking for.
[37:07.620 --> 37:09.380]  You know, you realize there is no,
[37:09.380 --> 37:10.820]  anybody could make a search engine.
[37:10.820 --> 37:13.100]  There are dozens and dozens of search engines.
[37:13.100 --> 37:15.140]  Before Google really grew to prominence,
[37:15.140 --> 37:17.740]  there was no dominant search engine.
[37:17.740 --> 37:19.500]  There were a handful.
[37:19.500 --> 37:21.100]  I was always an AltaVista man.
[37:21.100 --> 37:21.940]  What about you?
[37:21.940 --> 37:22.760]  What about you?
[37:22.760 --> 37:23.600]  What about you?
[37:23.600 --> 37:25.380]  AltaVista was my go-to.
[37:25.380 --> 37:26.680]  Yep, same.
[37:28.520 --> 37:33.520]  You know, but most people don't realize that.
[37:34.280 --> 37:37.300]  Like they see Google as the internet, right?
[37:37.300 --> 37:40.360]  You know, there's the famous stories about
[37:41.420 --> 37:43.240]  that the way people would get to Facebook
[37:43.240 --> 37:47.420]  is they'd go to Google and type Facebook login and hit go.
[37:47.420 --> 37:49.480]  You know, it is effectively,
[37:49.480 --> 37:52.720]  the Google search field is effectively
[37:52.720 --> 37:55.820]  like a command line interface to the internet.
[37:55.820 --> 37:56.660]  Yep.
[37:56.660 --> 38:00.120]  You know, and unlike the old command lines
[38:00.120 --> 38:02.740]  of Unix terminal and DOS,
[38:02.740 --> 38:04.880]  where everything is super fragile
[38:04.880 --> 38:07.160]  and you can make terrible mistakes
[38:07.160 --> 38:09.360]  or you have to type the name of the command precisely,
[38:09.360 --> 38:12.040]  you know, make one character mistake,
[38:12.040 --> 38:14.480]  you know, it's wonderfully user-friendly
[38:14.480 --> 38:17.560]  in that you can make all sorts of spelling mistakes
[38:17.560 --> 38:20.520]  and not even use spaces and somehow it figures out
[38:20.520 --> 38:23.200]  what you want anyway and it just works
[38:23.200 --> 38:25.000]  and there at the top of your results
[38:25.000 --> 38:26.760]  is exactly what you're looking for.
[38:31.040 --> 38:33.260]  I think even if people understood,
[38:33.260 --> 38:35.920]  if you could somehow sit everybody down across the world
[38:35.920 --> 38:38.620]  and give them a 15-minute lecture
[38:38.620 --> 38:40.780]  on what is a search engine
[38:40.780 --> 38:44.360]  and how do you change your default search engine
[38:44.360 --> 38:45.660]  and make them understand this,
[38:45.660 --> 38:48.440]  people would still be angry if the default was switched
[38:48.440 --> 38:51.420]  just by upgrading to iOS 13 or whatever,
[38:51.420 --> 38:54.520]  let alone the fact that they wouldn't understand.
[38:54.520 --> 38:57.760]  It would be like, what the hell is this, all right?
[38:57.760 --> 38:58.640]  Yep.
[38:58.640 --> 39:00.860]  So it, you know, it's a tough position.
[39:00.860 --> 39:02.940]  Like, I don't know that Apple, you know,
[39:02.940 --> 39:04.600]  I'm not, again, I'm not gonna say can't,
[39:04.600 --> 39:06.240]  but it would be very difficult for them
[39:06.240 --> 39:09.040]  to not have Google as their default search engine
[39:09.040 --> 39:10.900]  in Safari even if they wanted to,
[39:10.900 --> 39:15.900]  but nobody's forcing them to pocket money from it.
[39:15.900 --> 39:18.340]  Yeah, and I mean, we say that it's $12 billion
[39:18.340 --> 39:20.260]  and if they offered me $12 billion to use Google,
[39:20.260 --> 39:22.340]  I'd certainly take it.
[39:22.340 --> 39:25.020]  Well, and it reminds me of an argument
[39:25.020 --> 39:26.780]  that I often have with people about sports
[39:26.780 --> 39:30.780]  where people will argue, sports fans will argue
[39:30.780 --> 39:32.460]  that such and such player, you know,
[39:32.460 --> 39:35.500]  is gonna sign a $30 million a year contract
[39:35.500 --> 39:37.060]  and they say, well, nobody deserves,
[39:37.060 --> 39:38.220]  no, that's too much money.
[39:38.220 --> 39:39.780]  These players are greedy.
[39:39.780 --> 39:42.580]  Why in the world, you know, do you need that much money?
[39:42.580 --> 39:45.380]  Well, if the players weren't making the money
[39:45.380 --> 39:46.580]  that they're making,
[39:47.740 --> 39:51.460]  it's not like they're gonna lower the ticket prices
[39:51.460 --> 39:52.980]  in the stadiums and arenas
[39:52.980 --> 39:55.060]  and it's not like they're gonna lower the price
[39:55.060 --> 39:58.840]  of the commercials they're selling during the telecasts,
[39:58.840 --> 39:59.680]  which let's face it,
[39:59.680 --> 40:01.980]  is where most of the money in pro sports comes from.
[40:01.980 --> 40:04.540]  They're not going to lower the price of those ads
[40:04.540 --> 40:07.700]  that they see courtside or ring, you know,
[40:07.700 --> 40:12.700]  along the rink of the, you know, the hockey arena,
[40:14.540 --> 40:15.380]  all of that stuff,
[40:15.380 --> 40:17.740]  it's just gonna stay with the owners of the teams, right?
[40:17.740 --> 40:19.500]  If they're not, the less they pay the players,
[40:19.500 --> 40:21.420]  the more it's gonna stay with the owners of the teams
[40:21.420 --> 40:24.460]  and is that really what you want as a sports fan?
[40:24.460 --> 40:27.620]  You know, the rise in sports salaries going to players
[40:27.620 --> 40:28.940]  is actually a good thing.
[40:28.940 --> 40:31.260]  You know, historically 40, 50 years ago,
[40:31.260 --> 40:33.720]  it's almost criminal how underpaid players were
[40:33.720 --> 40:36.460]  in professional sports, at least in the United States.
[40:36.460 --> 40:39.620]  You know, the owners of the baseball teams
[40:39.620 --> 40:43.380]  collectively conspired to underpay their players
[40:43.380 --> 40:45.940]  and not allow them free agency.
[40:45.940 --> 40:48.740]  I mean, all of this stuff is actually relatively new
[40:48.740 --> 40:49.980]  to pro sports.
[40:49.980 --> 40:51.940]  Anyway, along those same lines,
[40:51.940 --> 40:56.140]  if Apple weren't taking $10 billion a year from Google
[40:56.140 --> 40:58.960]  for Google's being the default search engine
[40:58.960 --> 41:01.800]  and just did it for free to keep their hands clean,
[41:01.800 --> 41:04.140]  that money would be in Google's pockets.
[41:04.140 --> 41:06.620]  So, you know.
[41:06.620 --> 41:08.380]  It's a tax, they're taxing Google.
[41:09.580 --> 41:12.940]  But I really feel like this is something that Google,
[41:12.940 --> 41:14.780]  it's getting untenable for Apple
[41:14.780 --> 41:17.240]  to keep taking this pro-privacy stance
[41:17.240 --> 41:19.660]  without addressing this publicly.
[41:19.660 --> 41:21.740]  Yeah, it will always be used against them
[41:21.740 --> 41:22.740]  until it's addressed.
[41:24.540 --> 41:25.440]  I really do wonder.
[41:25.440 --> 41:30.440]  I know, DuckDuckGo, I didn't write about it,
[41:30.820 --> 41:33.260]  but I actually visited them recently
[41:33.260 --> 41:37.860]  because the one cool thing that's happened recently
[41:37.860 --> 41:42.860]  is that DuckDuckGo and Apple have partnered on maps
[41:43.700 --> 41:48.700]  and DuckDuckGo now uses Apple Maps as its mapping data.
[41:52.300 --> 41:56.540]  So it shows you Apple Maps when you search for a location
[41:56.540 --> 41:57.620]  all around the world.
[41:57.620 --> 42:02.620]  And it's a huge upgrade for DuckDuckGo.
[42:03.900 --> 42:07.300]  They were using like open something maps beforehand
[42:07.300 --> 42:10.460]  because DuckDuckGo, they're not just more private
[42:10.460 --> 42:13.540]  than Google or Bing or something like that.
[42:13.540 --> 42:17.020]  Privacy is actually fundamental to DuckDuckGo's mission.
[42:17.020 --> 42:18.920]  It's actually a higher priority for them
[42:18.920 --> 42:22.740]  than search result accuracy.
[42:22.740 --> 42:27.740]  So they don't show or distribute any third-party code
[42:30.620 --> 42:32.140]  like when you visit DuckDuckGo.
[42:32.140 --> 42:34.600]  There are no, none of the ads that they do have
[42:34.600 --> 42:38.520]  come from third parties and inject any kind of JavaScript
[42:38.520 --> 42:42.960]  or something like that from any server other than theirs.
[42:44.140 --> 42:44.980]  That's a problem.
[42:44.980 --> 42:47.880]  They had to work with Apple to get this map thing to work
[42:47.880 --> 42:50.140]  as the maps obviously aren't just static images.
[42:50.140 --> 42:55.140]  There is a lot of code involved, but effectively,
[42:55.860 --> 42:59.960]  it all gets proxied through DuckDuckGo's servers.
[42:59.960 --> 43:03.020]  So you go to DuckDuckGo as a user in Safari
[43:03.020 --> 43:06.060]  and you type your query and the query goes to DuckDuckGo.
[43:06.060 --> 43:07.860]  And if it's a location related query
[43:07.860 --> 43:11.420]  or the results involve location stuff,
[43:11.420 --> 43:16.140]  DuckDuckGo on their server talks to maps.apple.com
[43:16.140 --> 43:17.580]  and gets everything it needs.
[43:17.580 --> 43:19.740]  And it goes to DuckDuckGo and then DuckDuckGo
[43:19.740 --> 43:20.620]  delivers it to you.
[43:20.620 --> 43:25.260]  So maps.apple.com never sees your IP address,
[43:25.260 --> 43:26.720]  never talks to you directly.
[43:28.480 --> 43:29.480]  And you don't have to know this.
[43:29.480 --> 43:32.620]  Nobody, no regular person just using DuckDuckGo
[43:32.620 --> 43:35.460]  would know this, but that's how seriously
[43:35.460 --> 43:36.300]  they take your privacy.
[43:36.300 --> 43:37.500]  It's a really cool thing.
[43:39.540 --> 43:44.460]  And it really is the sort of thing that gives DuckDuckGo,
[43:44.460 --> 43:45.660]  they're too small of a company.
[43:45.660 --> 43:47.100]  I forget how many employees they have.
[43:47.100 --> 43:50.780]  It's somewhere around 60 around the world.
[43:50.780 --> 43:54.980]  That's the total size of the company.
[43:54.980 --> 44:01.180]  But effectively now, they have a multi-billion dollar partner
[44:01.180 --> 44:05.740]  helping them with maps, which is truly fascinating.
[44:05.740 --> 44:10.300]  And Apple is motivated to make its maps better.
[44:10.300 --> 44:13.260]  This is an area where clearly they are at best
[44:13.260 --> 44:17.900]  in second place to Google.
[44:17.900 --> 44:22.660]  They have terrific motivation in various ways
[44:22.660 --> 44:28.300]  to make their maps better and not just let's
[44:28.300 --> 44:30.900]  spend a year or two making our maps better and then forget it.
[44:30.900 --> 44:32.740]  This is something that the company obviously
[44:32.740 --> 44:35.820]  has to be committed to on an ongoing basis in perpetuity
[44:35.820 --> 44:40.420]  from now until the end of maps being a useful thing.
[44:40.420 --> 44:43.740]  And DuckDuckGo, as Apple Maps continues to improve
[44:43.740 --> 44:46.900]  and as directions and whatever else you get from Apple Maps,
[44:46.900 --> 44:55.140]  the data on the maps, the base of interesting locations,
[44:55.140 --> 44:57.740]  where stores are.
[44:57.740 --> 44:59.220]  One of Apple's recent initiatives
[44:59.220 --> 45:04.140]  is where are all the stores and retailers inside airport
[45:04.140 --> 45:05.420]  terminals?
[45:05.420 --> 45:07.100]  As that stuff improves, DuckDuckGo
[45:07.100 --> 45:11.780]  just gets it all for free, effectively.
[45:11.780 --> 45:13.580]  I thought that's pretty interesting.
[45:13.580 --> 45:15.580]  There's a bunch of people who just every time we
[45:15.580 --> 45:17.780]  talk about this say Apple should buy DuckDuckGo,
[45:17.780 --> 45:20.620]  make it the default search engine and invest heavily in it.
[45:20.620 --> 45:22.740]  This is where you've read my mind.
[45:22.740 --> 45:26.020]  This is where I'm going is, yes, that this comes out.
[45:26.020 --> 45:28.500]  And I've thought about that.
[45:28.500 --> 45:30.780]  I have thought about that a lot.
[45:30.780 --> 45:37.020]  I'm sure that people at Apple have thought about it.
[45:37.020 --> 45:41.340]  But I don't think it's as simple.
[45:41.340 --> 45:43.140]  I don't think it's a very simple decision.
[45:43.140 --> 45:46.020]  I think there's a lot of very complex ramifications.
[45:46.020 --> 45:49.140]  I think it's tempting to think of it
[45:49.140 --> 45:57.260]  simply because surely Apple could write a check that
[45:57.260 --> 46:01.700]  DuckDuckGo is big enough that DuckDuckGo would say yes.
[46:01.700 --> 46:02.820]  Yes.
[46:02.820 --> 46:07.940]  I really doubt it would even be if Apple decided
[46:07.940 --> 46:09.140]  they wanted to go that route.
[46:09.140 --> 46:11.300]  I don't even know that it would be a long negotiation.
[46:11.300 --> 46:18.460]  I suppose it's possible that DuckDuckGo values
[46:18.460 --> 46:24.020]  its independence and maybe that number is higher than it would
[46:24.020 --> 46:30.460]  be if they were looking to sell, which I know that they're not.
[46:30.460 --> 46:33.420]  But surely Apple could, it wouldn't take too long for them
[46:33.420 --> 46:34.780]  to add enough zeros at the end.
[46:34.780 --> 46:35.300]  Yes.
[46:35.300 --> 46:36.540]  I was thinking the same thing.
[46:36.540 --> 46:39.900]  They just saw the check getting longer.
[46:39.900 --> 46:42.020]  They write a check and then instead
[46:42.020 --> 46:44.500]  of crossing out the first number and making that one bigger,
[46:44.500 --> 46:46.940]  they just add another zero at the end.
[46:46.940 --> 46:47.820]  And what about now?
[46:50.500 --> 46:56.060]  So I don't think that part of it would be complicated.
[46:56.060 --> 47:01.100]  I think, though, that it would be comp.
[47:01.100 --> 47:04.100]  I think that at a certain angle, I
[47:04.100 --> 47:08.500]  think Apple enjoys not owning a search engine.
[47:08.500 --> 47:11.180]  And think about all the controversies that pop up
[47:11.180 --> 47:15.940]  all the time where, I mean, a recent one
[47:15.940 --> 47:22.860]  is this vaccination stuff where anti-vaccination propaganda
[47:22.860 --> 47:26.820]  comes up at the top of these search results,
[47:26.820 --> 47:29.700]  either in search engines or Facebook, I think,
[47:29.700 --> 47:32.500]  was just busted for promoting.
[47:32.500 --> 47:34.820]  You search on Facebook for vaccination stuff
[47:34.820 --> 47:38.940]  and it's all anti-vaccination stuff.
[47:38.940 --> 47:42.980]  And part of it is the fact that I just
[47:42.980 --> 47:46.380]  read a story that pro-vaccination doctors
[47:46.380 --> 47:49.860]  and experts have sort of given up because their stuff was
[47:49.860 --> 47:51.100]  getting buried anyway.
[47:51.100 --> 47:55.500]  And it's settled science anyway, so there isn't really
[47:55.500 --> 47:57.060]  much new stuff to write about.
[47:59.780 --> 48:02.780]  By not having a search engine, they avoid that.
[48:02.780 --> 48:04.020]  You name it.
[48:04.020 --> 48:09.060]  We could spend an hour listing controversial topics
[48:09.060 --> 48:11.820]  and where they fall in search results.
[48:11.820 --> 48:15.740]  YouTube has gone through two weeks of utter chaos
[48:15.740 --> 48:18.340]  over the very topic lately.
[48:18.340 --> 48:19.580]  Right.
[48:19.580 --> 48:21.460]  YouTube, yes, absolutely.
[48:21.460 --> 48:29.780]  It's almost in disarray, both in terms of algorithmic.
[48:29.780 --> 48:32.220]  The algorithmic recommendations is at the heart of it,
[48:32.220 --> 48:35.220]  but a big part of it, too, is the unmoderated comments
[48:35.220 --> 48:36.620]  and the subject of the comments.
[48:41.540 --> 48:43.620]  So on the one hand, I think Apple likes
[48:43.620 --> 48:44.860]  not owning a search engine.
[48:44.860 --> 48:51.540]  But I also think they like making $10 billion
[48:51.540 --> 48:52.500]  a year from Google.
[48:52.500 --> 49:01.980]  And this is where I see this as a sort of unspoken conflict
[49:01.980 --> 49:03.660]  of interest on Apple's part on privacy,
[49:03.660 --> 49:07.060]  is let's say they do buy DuckDuckGo,
[49:07.060 --> 49:09.420]  and they just rename it Apple Search.
[49:09.420 --> 49:16.180]  And they make it as private as they can.
[49:16.180 --> 49:22.900]  And let's even further stipulate that they improve the search
[49:22.900 --> 49:27.060]  results to the point where it's on par with Google search
[49:27.060 --> 49:31.340]  results, that people are as satisfied with it
[49:31.340 --> 49:33.980]  in general as they are with Google Search.
[49:33.980 --> 49:35.740]  I really doubt that Apple would be
[49:35.740 --> 49:43.540]  able to make $10 to $15 billion a year
[49:43.540 --> 49:48.420]  without changing their privacy.
[49:48.420 --> 49:51.860]  The whole reason Google search is so valuable
[49:51.860 --> 49:53.580]  makes so much money that Google's
[49:53.580 --> 49:55.540]  willing to spend $10 billion a year just
[49:55.540 --> 49:58.940]  to make it the default in one browser.
[49:58.940 --> 50:02.740]  Apple, let's face it, would have to forego
[50:02.740 --> 50:03.900]  a chunk of that revenue.
[50:03.900 --> 50:06.060]  I mean, presumably they could have some kind of ads,
[50:06.060 --> 50:08.700]  but the ads wouldn't be as lucrative as Google's.
[50:08.700 --> 50:11.620]  It's the developer ads from the App Store.
[50:11.620 --> 50:14.460]  But no, there's this anecdote about when Google started,
[50:14.460 --> 50:17.020]  and Larry and Sergey were adamant
[50:17.020 --> 50:18.420]  that it would have no ads.
[50:18.420 --> 50:20.500]  Because the minute you introduce ads,
[50:20.500 --> 50:22.620]  it would fundamentally corrupt the very nature
[50:22.620 --> 50:23.500]  of the search engine.
[50:23.500 --> 50:26.460]  They wanted it to be this very pure, very scientific,
[50:26.460 --> 50:28.940]  very egalitarian, very proper thing.
[50:28.940 --> 50:30.580]  But then the dot-com bubble burst,
[50:30.580 --> 50:33.060]  and their VCs, because the minute you take VCs,
[50:33.060 --> 50:35.580]  you are no longer in charge of your destiny.
[50:35.580 --> 50:37.860]  Their VCs said, you have to monetize,
[50:37.860 --> 50:39.660]  and so they turned on ads.
[50:39.660 --> 50:41.580]  And ads are like ultimate power.
[50:41.580 --> 50:43.100]  It never really leads to corruption,
[50:43.100 --> 50:46.140]  because you are no longer making a product to serve the customer.
[50:46.140 --> 50:48.700]  You are now making a product to serve the advertiser
[50:48.700 --> 50:51.300]  or the monetization engine.
[50:51.300 --> 50:54.340]  Apple would have to spend on ads,
[50:54.340 --> 50:58.900]  Apple would have to spend almost all that money as a giveaway,
[50:58.900 --> 51:00.540]  just to provide a service for users
[51:00.540 --> 51:02.860]  with very little upside to it.
[51:02.860 --> 51:05.860]  And Apple is good at spending money on accessibility.
[51:05.860 --> 51:07.900]  They're good at spending money on several things
[51:07.900 --> 51:09.220]  that they get no return from.
[51:09.220 --> 51:12.020]  And Tim Cook has famously, because Angry Tim is my favorite,
[51:12.020 --> 51:15.420]  has famously stood up and said, we don't give a damn about the ROI.
[51:15.420 --> 51:17.020]  But when you start operating services
[51:17.020 --> 51:19.820]  at scale, which would be like iMessage on the web
[51:19.820 --> 51:22.700]  or for Android, or FaceTime on the web or for Android,
[51:22.700 --> 51:24.860]  or a search engine, all of these things,
[51:24.860 --> 51:27.180]  and it doesn't fit into Apple's existing business model,
[51:27.180 --> 51:28.980]  they would either have to do it at a loss,
[51:28.980 --> 51:30.060]  and there's only so many of those things
[51:30.060 --> 51:31.580]  they could do at a loss, or they'd
[51:31.580 --> 51:34.220]  have to start doing what big companies do to support that,
[51:34.220 --> 51:36.380]  and that would make them just like Facebook and Google.
[51:36.380 --> 51:38.620]  Now, DuckDuckGo does make money.
[51:38.620 --> 51:41.140]  And they have ads, but they do it
[51:41.140 --> 51:44.260]  in a way that is completely respectful of your privacy
[51:44.260 --> 51:48.060]  and doesn't track you.
[51:48.060 --> 51:52.380]  And I don't, I've spoken to them about it.
[51:52.380 --> 51:55.460]  I, you know, they didn't tell me exactly how much money they
[51:55.460 --> 51:59.580]  make and how much they make per search or something like that.
[51:59.580 --> 52:01.740]  Because, you know, it's obviously
[52:01.740 --> 52:04.300]  confidential information, competitive.
[52:04.300 --> 52:06.940]  I'd be willing to bet, though, that they make less money
[52:06.940 --> 52:09.180]  per search than Google makes per search,
[52:09.180 --> 52:10.940]  that it's less lucrative.
[52:10.940 --> 52:11.620]  So Apple could.
[52:11.620 --> 52:12.780]  Because Google, they're literally bidding.
[52:12.780 --> 52:14.180]  They've put people in a situation
[52:14.180 --> 52:15.540]  to bid on those ads.
[52:15.540 --> 52:18.180]  Right.
[52:18.180 --> 52:20.020]  That's a tough position for Apple to be in.
[52:20.020 --> 52:21.580]  And I think it's easier for Apple
[52:21.580 --> 52:23.940]  to say we don't want to own our own search engine,
[52:23.940 --> 52:25.940]  because that's not our area of expertise,
[52:25.940 --> 52:28.900]  and we don't want to be responsible for it, whatever.
[52:28.900 --> 52:32.660]  But it's hard not to also think that they also
[52:32.660 --> 52:36.740]  enjoy their current relationship where their hands are clean,
[52:36.740 --> 52:41.980]  but they still get now $12 billion a year from Google
[52:41.980 --> 52:43.380]  doing things that they themselves
[52:43.380 --> 52:44.660]  are condemning privacy-wise.
[52:44.660 --> 52:46.340]  And being pragmatically, this isn't new.
[52:46.340 --> 52:48.140]  Like, a lot of people will just say, oh, Tim Cook is greedy.
[52:48.140 --> 52:50.220]  This relationship has been going on.
[52:50.220 --> 52:52.780]  Even famously, when Steve Jobs was at war with Google,
[52:52.780 --> 52:56.460]  it didn't change the default search engine in iOS.
[52:56.460 --> 52:58.620]  And at this point, like you said, when you change it,
[52:58.620 --> 53:00.340]  not only does it affect every user,
[53:00.340 --> 53:03.020]  but if you suddenly remove that income from Apple's services
[53:03.020 --> 53:05.300]  division, that's a whole different story on Wall Street
[53:05.300 --> 53:07.300]  as well.
[53:07.300 --> 53:08.100]  Yeah, yeah.
[53:08.100 --> 53:12.100]  That's exactly, if anything, that's the other thing
[53:12.100 --> 53:16.060]  that I feel a little uncomfortable looking
[53:16.060 --> 53:22.620]  at where the state of Apple today and where they're going,
[53:22.620 --> 53:24.300]  it's not just that I care about privacy.
[53:24.300 --> 53:27.980]  It's that I see this as a conflict,
[53:27.980 --> 53:30.900]  that there's tension inside Apple where they're promoting
[53:30.900 --> 53:33.300]  this services narrative to Wall Street
[53:33.300 --> 53:35.900]  as this is the area of growth.
[53:35.900 --> 53:42.540]  Yes, I mean, Apple hasn't said categorically iPhone unit sales
[53:42.540 --> 53:44.460]  are never going to grow again.
[53:44.460 --> 53:48.820]  But the truth is they probably aren't.
[53:48.820 --> 53:51.820]  We probably have seen peak iPhone in terms of unit sales.
[53:55.420 --> 53:56.980]  And pushing services is, but look,
[53:56.980 --> 53:59.460]  we have significant growth and lots
[53:59.460 --> 54:02.100]  of headroom in the services area.
[54:02.100 --> 54:04.780]  But where this huge chunk of it comes
[54:04.780 --> 54:08.980]  from just making Google search the default search engine
[54:08.980 --> 54:11.700]  really would make it hard for them to change that at all.
[54:11.700 --> 54:12.820]  And you start having all these things,
[54:12.820 --> 54:15.460]  like when you sold computers, you had to deal with resellers.
[54:15.460 --> 54:17.820]  And when you sold phones, you had to deal with carriers.
[54:17.820 --> 54:19.460]  And when you sold music and TV, you
[54:19.460 --> 54:20.900]  had to deal with the entertainment industry.
[54:20.900 --> 54:23.220]  But now you have to deal with medical regulation
[54:23.220 --> 54:24.020]  to be into health.
[54:24.020 --> 54:26.580]  You have to deal with the organizations that
[54:26.580 --> 54:29.180]  govern financial stuff when you get into Apple Pay and Apple
[54:29.180 --> 54:31.140]  credit cards and all these other things.
[54:31.140 --> 54:32.980]  And you start adding all these services businesses,
[54:32.980 --> 54:35.540]  you start having to deal with not only the regulatory bodies,
[54:35.540 --> 54:38.180]  but all the companies that are entrenched in those sectors.
[54:38.180 --> 54:40.300]  And it is messy.
[54:40.300 --> 54:44.980]  And it's fun, too, to think about in a what if or what
[54:44.980 --> 54:46.460]  else could Apple do?
[54:46.460 --> 54:48.340]  And like I said, they do some things
[54:48.340 --> 54:50.380]  where they have these serious suggested results that
[54:50.380 --> 54:51.380]  don't go through Google.
[54:51.380 --> 54:55.540]  But let's face it, one of the things Google is interested in
[54:55.540 --> 54:58.060]  is not just keeping track of your search results,
[54:58.060 --> 54:59.980]  but having you logged in to Google
[54:59.980 --> 55:01.700]  so that when you go to Google search,
[55:01.700 --> 55:03.980]  your Google profile is already there.
[55:03.980 --> 55:07.220]  And you can switch to, you can go to other Google properties
[55:07.220 --> 55:09.820]  and you're there.
[55:09.820 --> 55:12.300]  When you're logged into Google, and I
[55:12.300 --> 55:14.020]  try to log out of Google all the time,
[55:14.020 --> 55:16.220]  and I still often find myself like, oh, I've
[55:16.220 --> 55:18.180]  been logged in for days.
[55:18.180 --> 55:21.340]  I don't know that it's nefarious on Google.
[55:21.340 --> 55:23.500]  You log into your Gmail, then all of a sudden you're
[55:23.500 --> 55:25.340]  automatically logged into Maps, into YouTube,
[55:25.340 --> 55:27.140]  and a bunch of other apps as well.
[55:27.140 --> 55:29.260]  And that's for me is often where it happens,
[55:29.260 --> 55:31.740]  is I will log in to use Gmail.
[55:31.740 --> 55:35.060]  And it's just easier to do it in a regular tab
[55:35.060 --> 55:37.060]  than to make a private tab.
[55:37.060 --> 55:38.500]  What I've tried to do recently is
[55:38.500 --> 55:42.260]  I don't really use Chrome much for anything.
[55:42.260 --> 55:46.940]  And I've kind of got my Safari content blocking setup down
[55:46.940 --> 55:51.580]  where I don't need to use Chrome because I've got a nice setup
[55:51.580 --> 55:54.260]  where there are very few websites I find that break
[55:54.260 --> 55:56.860]  in Safari because I've got content blockers or something,
[55:56.860 --> 55:58.980]  and I have to go to Chrome or something like that.
[55:58.980 --> 56:03.220]  So I tend to just use Chrome just for using Google stuff.
[56:03.220 --> 56:06.780]  But anyway, one thing that Apple could obviously do
[56:06.780 --> 56:09.660]  would be to have some kind of, OK, we'll keep Google
[56:09.660 --> 56:11.700]  as the default search engine, but we'll also
[56:11.700 --> 56:15.340]  add a default behavior that will just erase cookies
[56:15.340 --> 56:17.460]  from Google every four hours.
[56:20.660 --> 56:24.700]  Unless you can go into Settings, Safari, Search,
[56:24.700 --> 56:29.660]  and toggle a simple check mark to say,
[56:29.660 --> 56:31.500]  well, I guess they're not check marks anymore.
[56:31.500 --> 56:33.780]  What do we call check marks on iOS?
[56:33.780 --> 56:35.500]  Those little?
[56:35.500 --> 56:36.820]  I still call them check marks.
[56:36.820 --> 56:37.820]  I don't know if there's a, I'm sure we'll
[56:37.820 --> 56:39.140]  get an email now that we've mentioned it.
[56:39.140 --> 56:41.420]  On off, I guess we should call them on off switches.
[56:41.420 --> 56:41.740]  Yeah.
[56:41.740 --> 56:42.420]  Right.
[56:42.420 --> 56:43.740]  Well, they're not radio buttons.
[56:43.740 --> 56:44.580]  Toggles.
[56:44.580 --> 56:45.220]  Toggles?
[56:45.220 --> 56:48.100]  Well, the thing that's effectively a check box.
[56:48.100 --> 56:51.180]  You could turn it on, but it's going to be off by default,
[56:51.180 --> 56:55.180]  and it'll just keep you logged out of Google
[56:55.180 --> 56:58.460]  even after you log in after, I don't know,
[56:58.460 --> 57:01.260]  two hours or four hours or something like that.
[57:01.260 --> 57:06.300]  I'm pretty sure if Apple did that, that would, A,
[57:06.300 --> 57:08.580]  that would probably, they'd have to,
[57:08.580 --> 57:11.780]  that would have to be part of a new negotiation.
[57:11.780 --> 57:13.860]  I would be fairly certain that Google is smart enough
[57:13.860 --> 57:16.780]  that the letter of their contract with Google,
[57:16.780 --> 57:23.100]  with Apple, for making Google the search engine as it exists
[57:23.100 --> 57:25.580]  right now, I'd be very surprised if it doesn't preclude
[57:25.580 --> 57:26.940]  something like that.
[57:26.940 --> 57:28.820]  The scarier thing is for Google to say, fine,
[57:28.820 --> 57:31.500]  we don't need you to help us put this information together.
[57:31.500 --> 57:32.660]  We know who they are anyway.
[57:32.660 --> 57:33.740]  It would be terrifying.
[57:33.740 --> 57:35.900]  It's funny because I try to use Google in Chrome too,
[57:35.900 --> 57:37.860]  and because our company, Mobile Nations,
[57:37.860 --> 57:40.580]  and I'm where we use Google accounts,
[57:40.580 --> 57:43.820]  and I try not to stay logged in, but I have to use my work
[57:43.820 --> 57:46.700]  stuff, and then it keeps saying, you need to sign into sync,
[57:46.700 --> 57:48.700]  and I don't want to sign into sync.
[57:48.700 --> 57:51.380]  So every time I refuse, it takes me out of my Mobile Nations
[57:51.380 --> 57:54.940]  account and gives me this fake cupcake Rene avatar
[57:54.940 --> 57:57.340]  that I don't know what it is, and I can't get out of it
[57:57.340 --> 58:00.380]  until I close everything and relog back into my account.
[58:00.380 --> 58:02.040]  And they just do all these little things
[58:02.040 --> 58:03.580]  to make your life more miserable when
[58:03.580 --> 58:05.900]  you're not logged into them.
[58:05.900 --> 58:07.180]  Cupcake house.
[58:07.180 --> 58:08.580]  All right, let me take a break here
[58:08.580 --> 58:11.900]  and thank our next sponsor, longtime sponsor of the show,
[58:11.900 --> 58:15.260]  one of my favorite companies on the internet, Fracture.
[58:15.260 --> 58:19.100]  Look, everyone takes and shares photos online.
[58:19.100 --> 58:23.580]  I'll bet you, dear listener of the talk show,
[58:23.580 --> 58:25.920]  I'm willing to bet you have already
[58:25.920 --> 58:29.420]  taken at least one photo with your phone today.
[58:29.420 --> 58:32.260]  Maybe you're listening on your morning commute,
[58:32.260 --> 58:34.220]  and you can say, ha ha, John, you're wrong.
[58:34.220 --> 58:35.820]  I haven't.
[58:35.820 --> 58:37.940]  But then I'll bet you will take at least one photo
[58:37.940 --> 58:39.060]  with your phone today.
[58:39.060 --> 58:40.180]  We all do, right?
[58:40.180 --> 58:42.600]  How many days go by where you don't take at least one photo?
[58:42.600 --> 58:43.820]  I take them all the time.
[58:43.820 --> 58:47.060]  Our phone full with thousands of photos every year,
[58:47.060 --> 58:49.660]  and we share them online, we post them to Instagram,
[58:49.660 --> 58:50.700]  we put them in iMessage.
[58:53.380 --> 58:54.780]  We look at them on our phones, we
[58:54.780 --> 58:56.700]  look at them on our other devices.
[58:56.700 --> 58:58.620]  You know what's great with your photos, though?
[58:58.620 --> 59:01.100]  Take the ones you like the most, the ones that really,
[59:01.100 --> 59:04.140]  the people you love the most, your family,
[59:04.140 --> 59:07.140]  your significant others, your friends,
[59:07.140 --> 59:12.140]  the places you've gone that are the most visually stimulating.
[59:12.140 --> 59:13.660]  Print them out, get them printed,
[59:13.660 --> 59:16.860]  hang them on your wall in an analog form.
[59:16.860 --> 59:19.720]  There's nothing, no better way to decorate your house,
[59:19.720 --> 59:22.580]  no matter what your sense of decor is.
[59:22.580 --> 59:26.260]  It just makes you happy, makes your living space better,
[59:26.260 --> 59:29.660]  to just cover the walls with your personal photos
[59:29.660 --> 59:31.940]  of the people you love and the places you've been.
[59:31.940 --> 59:36.180]  And one of the best ways to do it is with Fracture.
[59:36.180 --> 59:38.480]  They print your photos directly on glass.
[59:38.480 --> 59:40.140]  If you're a longtime listener to the show,
[59:40.140 --> 59:42.100]  you've heard me tell you this before.
[59:42.100 --> 59:43.900]  But you really have to see it in person.
[59:43.900 --> 59:46.300]  The first time anybody, I know I've talked to people,
[59:46.300 --> 59:47.580]  and they're like, you know, you've
[59:47.580 --> 59:49.920]  talked my ear off about Fracture on your podcast so many times.
[59:49.920 --> 59:52.300]  And then I finally saw one, and I was like, oh, you're right.
[59:52.300 --> 59:55.380]  It doesn't look anything like a piece of paper
[59:55.380 --> 59:57.500]  with a photo on it mounted under glass.
[59:57.500 --> 01:00:01.460]  It really looks different by printing directly on the glass.
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:02.860]  It looks so much better.
[01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:05.540]  It's so amazing.
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:08.340]  And every one you get, whether it's really big
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:11.060]  and they have really big sizes or really small,
[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:13.580]  and they've got ones right down to like little three
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:17.080]  by three squares that you can put on your desk,
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:20.220]  everything comes in the box that you need to hang it
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:22.340]  or to prop it up on your mantel, on your desk,
[01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:23.300]  whatever you need.
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:25.340]  And you don't need to put these in a frame.
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:26.460]  There is no frame.
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:28.620]  The piece of glass with the image
[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:31.340]  that goes edge to edge, corner to corner,
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:34.740]  it just hangs on the wall, mounts on your desk
[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:39.900]  with no frame, just pure picture, edge to edge.
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:43.020]  And they're handmade right here in the US in their quote,
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:46.620]  unquote, fractory in Gainesville, Florida.
[01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:48.680]  It's a timeless design.
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:49.420]  They really do.
[01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:51.380]  They're so minimal with no frame,
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:53.620]  just corner to corner picture.
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:55.780]  They really do go with any decor.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:57.740]  So here's where you go to find out more.
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:00.660]  Go to fracture.me.
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:03.540]  That's fracture.me, and you'll get a special discount
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:06.020]  on your first fracture order just by going there.
[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:08.460]  And then don't forget to pick the talk show
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:11.060]  in their one question survey after checkout.
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:13.900]  And that question is, where'd you hear about fracture?
[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:16.380]  Fracture.me is their website.
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:17.220]  You'll get a code.
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:18.760]  You'll get a discount just by going there
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.500]  on your first order.
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:21.700]  Mother's Day is coming up.
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.060]  Great gift idea.
[01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:26.700]  My thanks to Fracture for their continuing support
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:27.540]  of the talk show.
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:28.440]  Love that company.
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:33.540]  What else is on the agenda today?
[01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:34.380]  I had so many.
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:35.660]  So much.
[01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:40.660]  How about the shot on iPhone challenge?
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:41.820]  Yeah.
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:44.420]  Apple announced the winners yesterday.
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:47.860]  Lot of iPhone XS Max and a lot of Americans.
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:48.900]  Yeah, I was wrong.
[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:51.140]  I said I would eat my hat if at least one winner
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.220]  didn't come from China.
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:54.060]  There were no winners from China.
[01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:55.380]  I was a judge from China, which is interesting.
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:57.100]  I think that there would have been,
[01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:58.900]  it's just given the size of the market.
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:01:59.740]  Yeah.
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:02.580]  I just linked to this before we started recording the show.
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:04.940]  I love the winners.
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:07.020]  I'm not surprised that they're great.
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:09.060]  I mean, I think it's one of the,
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:12.180]  not just a great Apple ad campaign.
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:14.540]  I think it's been one of the best ad campaigns
[01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:17.740]  in recent years is the shot on iPhone ad campaign.
[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:22.740]  And I feel like it's a great campaign in so many ways
[01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:24.940]  because it makes good photographs
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:26.940]  make for good billboards, right?
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:27.780]  Yep.
[01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:32.780]  It is a thing that real people really do with their phones.
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:35.180]  I don't know if there's any single thing
[01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:36.220]  people do on their phone,
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:38.220]  that more people do on their phones
[01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:39.640]  than take photographs, right?
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:43.100]  I mean, I'm sure listening.
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:44.980]  You text and take photos and you text your photos.
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:45.820]  That's right.
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:47.260]  And you listen to music, right?
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:48.760]  I mean, in podcasts.
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:52.700]  I mean, we wouldn't have had so many arguments
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:55.780]  about headphone jacks if that wasn't part of it.
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:02.780]  And they obviously, the iPhone camera is technically great.
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:06.140]  It is amazing and it's not just the iPhone,
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:10.220]  just modern high-end cell phone cameras are just tremendous.
[01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:14.180]  So I'm not surprised that these winners are good
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:15.820]  but I really do like them.
[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:19.620]  I love this one comment from Judge Austin Mann
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:21.820]  where he just says,
[01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:26.820]  it's just this one picture from Nikita Yerush in Belarus
[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:29.300]  shot with an iPhone 7, which is pretty cool.
[01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:32.180]  That's the one that I would have bet more than
[01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:35.020]  that somebody, a winner would be from China
[01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:36.860]  would be that at least some of the winners
[01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:38.220]  would be on older iPhones.
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:41.220]  And again, I don't think that they cook the books for it
[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:46.220]  but I just know, and you see it in the ad campaigns too
[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:49.900]  that it's not just, oh, look what you can shoot
[01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:54.540]  with the latest and greatest $1,200 iPhone XS Max.
[01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:59.140]  It is, hey, the iPhone 7 from three years ago
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:00.940]  is still a tremendous camera.
[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:01.780]  Anyway, she took it.
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:03.260]  And the announcement for the contest,
[01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:04.420]  they had success photos.
[01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:06.380]  Yeah, yeah, a couple of them.
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:07.460]  Yep.
[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:10.740]  Anyway, Nikita's photo, which is also one of my favorites
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:14.740]  is of a tennis court, like an orange tennis court.
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:15.700]  Maybe that's clay.
[01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:16.540]  I don't know.
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:17.540]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:22.540]  With the net and a line and a crack in the clay.
[01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:25.980]  And it's just a super simple photo.
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:26.980]  Yeah.
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:29.020]  And I just love Austin Mann's comment.
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:30.580]  I love how accessible this image is.
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:32.300]  You don't have to travel to Iceland
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:33.580]  to capture something beautiful.
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:34.980]  It's right under your nose.
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:37.540]  And I think that's so true
[01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:40.180]  because that's what I love about these iPhone.
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:41.020]  I don't know.
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:44.300]  I'm a long time avid amateur photographer.
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:48.180]  And I love looking at truly great photos
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:50.220]  from truly great photographers
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:51.780]  because it's inspiring.
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:55.340]  It makes me wanna up my photography game.
[01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:58.380]  And one of the things that I think is so fascinating
[01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:02.300]  about seeing pro photographers like Austin Mann,
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:05.980]  if the name rings a bell,
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:10.980]  Austin Mann, his last few years has been doing reviews
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:15.660]  of new iPhone cameras by taking them to exotic locations
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:17.780]  around the world, like Africa, he was the one year
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:20.940]  he was with a bunch of silverback gorillas
[01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:23.020]  and I forget where else he's been.
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:23.860]  I think he-
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:24.780]  An incredibly talented photographer.
[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:27.460]  Super talented photographer and a very nice guy.
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:28.300]  I met him-
[01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:29.340]  Yeah, he's amazing.
[01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:31.300]  After the last iPhone event.
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:36.300]  And we've corresponded by email for years too,
[01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:38.660]  but I met him in person and he's super, super generous
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:41.420]  and really is a super great enthusiast
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:45.540]  about like helping people up their photography game
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:46.380]  with phones.
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:47.220]  But one of the things that's amazing
[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:50.100]  looking at the images coming from a pro photographer
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:53.300]  like that is you just have no excuse about equipment.
[01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:58.820]  Like you can't say, well, he is using a $5,000-
[01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:00.900]  And I love how he gets like feedback too
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:03.220]  because he's like, I love this new smart HDR thing
[01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:05.060]  but you're making it impossible for me to take silhouettes
[01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:07.140]  and it's part of my artistic repertoire.
[01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:08.980]  So can we figure this out?
[01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:11.180]  Right, that's actually very true.
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:17.220]  And a couple of these photos are taken in exotic locations
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:20.700]  but most of them aren't and that really is inspiring too
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:23.220]  but it really is true, there's not much,
[01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:27.500]  somebody who's an expert photographer can use
[01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:32.500]  a quote unquote pro app like Halide,
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:36.180]  which is a great, great iPhone camera app
[01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:38.900]  and you can shoot raw instead of JPEG
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:43.900]  and then by shooting raw, you can get more in post
[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:46.580]  than you could with the JPEG.
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:53.100]  And if you truly understand what the effect
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:55.340]  that different shutter speeds have on an image
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:59.980]  or exposure times or ISO or whatever,
[01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:02.700]  there's some things you can adjust in some of these apps
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:04.780]  but for the most part though, the pros,
[01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:06.340]  they might know more about that
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:08.980]  but they're not really using any kind of even software tools
[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:10.780]  that aren't accessible to everybody.
[01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:15.500]  So like the inspiration level on these is super high to me
[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:22.260]  as opposed to say like a National Geographic photo contest
[01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:26.380]  where they really are shot from like the four corners
[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:27.300]  of the globe.
[01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:31.340]  I was also like just surprised that Apple didn't pan,
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:33.780]  like this isn't Apple pandering
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:35.020]  because there's no like, oh, look,
[01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:38.100]  this is using the new depth effect from our iPhone XR,
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:40.500]  you know, like there's not a single portrait,
[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:43.620]  they're not the usual, oh, a picture of a pet,
[01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:46.140]  picture of a face, someone sitting on a corner,
[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:48.900]  you know, if they really went for different looking stuff.
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:50.340]  Well, it's funny you would bring that up.
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:53.100]  I actually noticed looking at the winners that,
[01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:57.980]  so promotionally, Apple has spent a lot of time
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:00.020]  the last two years talking about the portrait effect
[01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:04.580]  which is about blurring the background artificially,
[01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:08.620]  you know, through, you know, to create though the look,
[01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:13.260]  the quote unquote bokeh effect of a shallow depth of field
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:14.740]  where the subject is in focus
[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:16.740]  and the background is out of focus and it's-
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:17.900]  Why did you bokeh Jacob?
[01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:18.740]  Why did you bokeh Jacob?
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:20.060]  I mean, it's everywhere.
[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:22.540]  It is, that's a funny ad and it is-
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:23.500]  It's great, it's terrific.
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:27.220]  Yeah, if you haven't seen it, it's a couple of,
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:28.500]  I think it's, I think they're all women,
[01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.100]  it's a bunch of moms are talking
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:33.060]  and one mom is taking a photo of the other mom's child
[01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:34.740]  and it's a portrait photo
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:38.940]  and the other woman's child is in the background
[01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:42.260]  and she's, why did you bokeh my child?
[01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:44.340]  And she says, I would never bokeh Jacob.
[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:46.860]  Why do you, yeah, why do you hate Jacob?
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:48.100]  What kind of person does that?
[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:51.220]  It's really funny though, to see that it,
[01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:52.500]  I just never expected,
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.740]  I've known the word bokeh for a long time,
[01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:57.820]  like I said, as an amateur photo enthusiast,
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:09:00.660]  I never expected to see it in a mainstream ad,
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:04.500]  on prime time TV, but it's entered-
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:07.340]  Being turned to a verb, yeah.
[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:08.740]  I actually think it's interesting
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:12.100]  how many of these winning images actually have the opposite.
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:17.100]  They have a truly infinite depth of field,
[01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:19.180]  that there's a foreground subject
[01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:21.500]  and a background that are both in focus.
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:26.020]  Here's this one, there's one of the winning photos
[01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:27.660]  by Elizabeth Skarret here in the US.
[01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:29.180]  I'm just looking at it now, yeah.
[01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:31.820]  With an iPhone 8 Plus, so it's another older phone,
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:34.020]  but it's a portrait of, I guess, her daughter
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:38.340]  up close to the camera with,
[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.340]  is that El Capitan in the background?
[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:42.220]  It might be, I'm not good with the mountains.
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:43.060]  I don't know.
[01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:43.900]  Yeah, there's mountains behind her
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:45.660]  and grass in front of her. Let's just say it's El Capitan,
[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:48.620]  but the mountain is in focus.
[01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:53.140]  The clouds, literally tens of miles away are in focus.
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:56.500]  And of course, the little girl is in perfect focus,
[01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:58.920]  including individual strands of her hair.
[01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:01.500]  Yeah, I would say that it's funny
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:02.340]  how many of these winners
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:05.180]  actually have a really deep depth of field.
[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:07.220]  And she uses contrast against the trees
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:08.780]  and the brightness of the grass
[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:11.660]  to make the separation, not the blur effect.
[01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:14.740]  Yeah, it's a really good photo.
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:15.940]  And again, really hard to believe
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:17.780]  it's taken with a cell phone.
[01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:23.820]  Really, it's inspiring.
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:25.420]  And they had a bunch of photographer judges,
[01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:26.960]  but they also had like Phil Schiller,
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.940]  Kayan Duran, Sebastian Maranomas.
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:30.320]  They had a bunch of Apple,
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.660]  like people from the Apple marketing
[01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:35.340]  and the camera teams judging, so you had a wide range.
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:36.740]  That's a name that might ring a bell.
[01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:38.780]  She was actually on stage for the first time
[01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:43.100]  at the introduction of the iPhone,
[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:45.540]  this year's iPhones in September.
[01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:46.780]  The A12 segment.
[01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:49.420]  Yeah, she had the segment,
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:51.640]  which was really, I think one of the toughest parts
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:56.080]  was explaining the, how does the A12 AI stuff
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:00.300]  make photography better,
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:03.340]  which could easily have gotten out into the weeds
[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:07.700]  and instead was a really succinct, oh, okay, I get it.
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:08.980]  We're making better images,
[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:10.980]  not just through lenses and sensors.
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:14.860]  It really is billions.
[01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:18.060]  It's like billions of computational decisions
[01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:21.900]  made for each shot instantaneously as you shoot it.
[01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:22.740]  It was a really good segment.
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:23.580]  And I know people have said this before,
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:24.700]  but it's worth pointing,
[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:25.860]  I've spoken to a lot of companies
[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:28.100]  where the marketing people are essentially salespeople.
[01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:29.700]  They're like a used car salesman
[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:31.680]  and they have no idea how the technology works
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.520]  or anything behind it.
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:33.860]  They just want you to buy it.
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:36.380]  And Apple's team is very different.
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:38.260]  Most of them have engineering degrees.
[01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:39.700]  They all are incredibly smart
[01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:42.140]  and they know how it works literally down to the Silicon.
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:44.340]  And you see that when they do present on stage
[01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:46.620]  and also Sebastian, if people don't know Sebastian,
[01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:47.800]  he's been doing State of the Union
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.380]  for the last couple of years.
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:51.260]  Also very, very smart.
[01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:52.300]  He runs a camera team now,
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:55.520]  used to be vice president of software at QNX previously.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.660]  These are all real serious people.
[01:11:57.660 --> 01:11:58.740]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:00.620]  I think my favorite, I picked my favorite.
[01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:01.960]  I'm gonna ask you yours.
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.020]  They're all good.
[01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:05.460]  My favorite though is Darren Sowes.
[01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:08.700]  He's from Singapore and it's a reflection of like,
[01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:10.100]  I'm guessing like an apartment building.
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:13.420]  It's hard to say, some kind of high rise in a puddle.
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:16.700]  And it, I don't know what, I don't know.
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:18.780]  It's so, it's very obvious.
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:20.220]  I think, is it Phil Schiller?
[01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:21.940]  Yeah, Phil Schiller's comments on this one.
[01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:22.960]  He was one of the judges.
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:24.760]  It's a reflection that looks like a painting.
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.960]  I mean, and it's the best way to say it,
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:28.860]  but it looks so much like a painting.
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:30.260]  It's stunning.
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:32.860]  And I think that, I think it would be a great photo anyway,
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:35.300]  but there's a bird that's captured in the sky
[01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:38.700]  that in like, just the perfect location
[01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:40.900]  that really makes it.
[01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:42.900]  It's just, it's such a compelling image.
[01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:44.040]  Yeah.
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.440]  And just great color.
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:46.900]  And that's probably my favorite.
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:48.240]  It's when you look at it every time you see,
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.600]  like you see the building and you look again,
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:50.860]  you notice the puddle and you look again,
[01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:52.900]  you notice the different, like the layers of the puddle.
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.460]  It's just so many depths to it.
[01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:55.500]  So much depth to it.
[01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:57.660]  Yeah, what's your favorite?
[01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:00.600]  I like, I don't know if it's Dina or Dinah Al-Fasi
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:01.440]  from Israel.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.560]  And she just got this perfect frame
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:06.060]  of like this desolate sidewalk with a little tiny leaf
[01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:08.940]  in the corner, but then this perfect heart-shaped puddle,
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:11.700]  which is this deep blue and a person walking.
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:15.240]  Again, everything is just perfectly framed in that instant
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:17.960]  with like the world behind them, but you're not part of it.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.260]  But maybe if you follow them, you could be.
[01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:22.840]  And it's just like, it's mystery and evocative
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:25.540]  at the same time, mysterious and evocative.
[01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:28.360]  Yeah, I'm also, it's like.
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.900]  iPhone 10, by the way.
[01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:30.740]  iPhone 10.
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:34.140]  Yeah, it's fascinating too,
[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:36.180]  because until I noticed the leaf,
[01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:39.700]  I was even unsure of the scale.
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:40.540]  Yeah.
[01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:42.880]  Like I kind of thought it was a relatively small puddle,
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.780]  but I wasn't sure.
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:45.840]  It, I don't know.
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:46.740]  It's a great image too.
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:48.580]  They're all, you know, unsurprising.
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:49.980]  And then you realize the person walking is upside down
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:51.740]  to make them look right side up in the puzzle,
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:52.580]  in the puddle. Right.
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:56.300]  And, you know, it's again, many layers of perception.
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:57.980]  Yeah, it's really cool.
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:01.500]  And I'm shocker, the 10 best photos
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:05.440]  in this very highly promoted iPhone photo contest
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:08.660]  are all amazing images, but they really are.
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:10.420]  And it's super, super inspiring,
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:13.780]  knowing that I'm walking around every waking moment
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:17.340]  of my life with a camera as good or better
[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:21.220]  than what was used to take every one of these images.
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:24.160]  So thank you for making me feel like a terrible,
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:27.460]  incompetent photographer, Apple.
[01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:28.300]  Yeah.
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:29.940]  And what I love about it still is it like, you know,
[01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:31.700]  people argue about which camera is the best,
[01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:34.220]  but you really, for just taking a camera out of your pocket
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:36.940]  and taking a shot and not having to worry about the app
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:38.980]  taking forever to launch or figuring out
[01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:41.540]  which of 19 different AI modes you want to engage for that.
[01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:43.540]  Like just take it out of your pocket, take a shot
[01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:46.860]  and odds are you're going to get a really useful photo.
[01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:47.940]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:49.980]  It's, I don't know.
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:53.380]  It's for as depressing as our opening segment was
[01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:55.660]  on the state of privacy in the industry.
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:15:00.660]  It's super exciting to me how amazing
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:04.580]  the cameras we have with us at all times are,
[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:07.240]  you know, including video.
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:11.420]  All right, next segment.
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:13.700]  How about we talk about folding phones?
[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:15.300]  Yeah, sure.
[01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:17.220]  So we have two folding phones now.
[01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:19.980]  We had, I think I spoke about it with Glenn Fleishman
[01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:24.980]  in last week's episode, the Samsung Galaxy Fold,
[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:28.900]  very intriguingly named.
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:30.660]  And the people who brought you
[01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:33.100]  the Samsung Galaxy Circle in previous years.
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:37.340]  This was introduced at Samsung's quote unquote,
[01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:42.340]  unpacked event like a week and a half ago in San Francisco
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:45.060]  at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium.
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.640]  And now this week at the,
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:50.860]  what's the name of the show in Barcelona?
[01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:52.420]  Mobile World Congress, MWC.
[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:54.880]  MWC, Mobile World Congress is a big,
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:16:00.500]  every company other than Samsung and Apple
[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:03.680]  introduced their phones at MWC.
[01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:08.540]  And Huawei unveiled their Mate X.
[01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:10.140]  Is it the Mate X or Mate 10?
[01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:11.580]  I don't know, it's spelled with a mate.
[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:14.420]  Yeah, it's hard, but yeah, it's the Mate X.
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:16.140]  All right, their folding phone.
[01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:18.500]  But before I get to them,
[01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:21.860]  let me actually take a moment here on an aside.
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:22.980]  Here's something I didn't know.
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:24.580]  I think I forget if this was on the show
[01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:26.380]  or something I wrote about.
[01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:28.300]  I think it was when I wrote about Samsung's phone
[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:31.460]  and I had a little parenthetical wondering
[01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:34.300]  why the hell did they call everything the Galaxy whatever,
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:36.140]  because it's just adding an extra word.
[01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:38.560]  Every single thing they unveiled, Samsung unveiled
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.820]  is the Samsung Galaxy blank.
[01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:44.860]  The phones are the Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus.
[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:49.060]  The earbuds are the Samsung Galaxy Buds,
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:50.540]  I think they're calling them.
[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:52.140]  Why not just the Samsung Buds?
[01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:54.960]  Why do they insert Galaxy into all of it?
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:59.580]  And the one answer I got from people
[01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:03.220]  is that Samsung is such a bizarre conglomerate
[01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:07.340]  that they make washing machines and refrigerators
[01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:11.340]  and all of these other various things
[01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:12.860]  that the Galaxy thing is a way to say
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:17.180]  this is our computer stuff, I don't know.
[01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:18.380]  I wouldn't be surprised if they come out
[01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:20.980]  with a Galaxy refrigerator, frankly.
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:22.320]  It's a bunch of different companies
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:24.220]  that all license the name Samsung
[01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:26.260]  and are owned to a certain percentage
[01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:28.480]  by the Samsung company, I believe.
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.220]  Not completely owned all the time,
[01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:32.060]  but partially owned at least.
[01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:35.900]  The more interesting angle, and this is news to me,
[01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:40.900]  is that in Japan, Korean brands are so frowned upon
[01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:45.460]  and looked upon with such disdain that,
[01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:46.860]  and at least Samsung in particular,
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:50.860]  that Samsung doesn't use the Samsung brand in Japan.
[01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:53.380]  When you buy a Samsung phone in Japan,
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:55.580]  it's just called like the Galaxy S10
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:57.760]  and it doesn't say Samsung on the back,
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.460]  so it's like a different SKU.
[01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:01.460]  It doesn't have that Samsung logo on it.
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:04.700]  Like Datsun before Nissan.
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:06.660]  Yeah, it's really wild.
[01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:09.940]  A couple of readers and listeners or whatever,
[01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:14.660]  but who live in Japan sent me pictures and stuff of like,
[01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:15.900]  and the other thing too is Japan
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:20.060]  is still a very carrier-centric dominated country.
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:22.820]  Probably not that different than the US.
[01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:24.500]  Like in Europe, there's a lot of places
[01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:27.280]  where your carrier is just an afterthought
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.500]  and you can just, you know, people just pop in SIMs
[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.720]  and nobody even really, you know,
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:34.180]  people change carriers a lot freer
[01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:38.700]  and buy their phones independent of their carrier service.
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:41.560]  But Japan, it's still very dominated by the carriers.
[01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:43.860]  But you know, somebody had a photo,
[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:45.620]  I forget which one of the Japanese,
[01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:48.660]  maybe Docomo, I think, but one of their stores
[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:51.820]  and like the Samsung kiosk doesn't say Samsung anywhere.
[01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:53.140]  It's just all Galaxy.
[01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:54.700]  So they use that Galaxy brand
[01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:57.400]  so that they don't have to say Samsung.
[01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.180]  I really was blown away by it.
[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:01.380]  It's so, it's kind of bizarre
[01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:04.060]  because I've always been hung up on the weird way
[01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:07.340]  that Samsung loves to put their logo so big.
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:08.840]  It's not even a good logo.
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:09.680]  I mean, it's just-
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:12.380]  And they spent billions on putting it everywhere.
[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.620]  Right, and that of all the things I always used to say,
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:16.580]  they copied so much from the iPhone
[01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:19.260]  and the one thing they couldn't bring themselves to copy
[01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:21.620]  was the humility of not putting your logo
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:23.380]  on the front of the phone.
[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:25.020]  They like, they kept that Samsung thing
[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:26.600]  on the front of the phone until they ran out
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.440]  of chance to change the forehead.
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:29.140]  Until there was no more front on the phone.
[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:31.620]  Right, until there was no more front.
[01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:33.140]  And then they started putting it on the back,
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:34.380]  but not in Japan.
[01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:35.700]  In Japan, it's Galaxy.
[01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:37.940]  So there's my aside on that.
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.780]  So I guess that means they're stuck
[01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:41.180]  in the rest of the world,
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:44.740]  calling everything Samsung Galaxy, blah, blah, blah.
[01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:48.780]  Ah, man.
[01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:51.700]  Anyway, we got the Huawei Mate X
[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:53.700]  and we've got the Samsung Galaxy Fold
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:56.580]  and it's a fascinating one-two punch
[01:19:56.580 --> 01:20:00.620]  because they literally fold the opposite way.
[01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:02.660]  They're actually, you know, fundamentally-
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:04.140]  In an Audi TM.
[01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:06.700]  Fundamentally, the same basic idea.
[01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:10.500]  You have a cell phone-sized smartphone
[01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:15.500]  that unfolds to a squarish tablet-sized device,
[01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:18.460]  but because the ones in any and ones in Audi,
[01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:20.260]  it's two very different takes on it.
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:26.780]  Neither one of them is practically priced.
[01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:30.700]  The Samsung Galaxy Fold starts at $1,980
[01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:34.060]  and I think the Mate X is 2,300 euros,
[01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:38.300]  which I did the calculation at least as of a day or two ago,
[01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:41.260]  that was $2,600.
[01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:42.100]  Which you can't get it,
[01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:42.940]  like you'll have to import it
[01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:44.620]  because you can't buy it in the US.
[01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:49.460]  Right, because Huawei has a very strange relationship
[01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:50.700]  with the United States.
[01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:58.420]  It's funny being the iPhone enthusiast
[01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:00.940]  and now being the one laughing at the prices
[01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:03.140]  of other people's phones.
[01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:06.980]  At least it's not Samsung expensive
[01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:08.780]  is everything every Apple person can say now.
[01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:11.860]  Yeah, but clearly it would be different though
[01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:15.060]  if the Samsung Galaxy S10 were $2,000
[01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:18.660]  because clearly the S10 and S10 Plus and the S10e,
[01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:21.980]  those three phones are the ones that are meant to,
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:26.580]  they are Samsung's flagship phones for 2019.
[01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:31.020]  This folding thing is not meant to sell in huge quantities.
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:32.940]  No, and that's part of the reason why it's priced out
[01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:33.940]  because it's a small batch
[01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:37.820]  and they have to sort of spread out the cost of running it
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:38.940]  amongst the units.
[01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:40.180]  And early adopters will pay a lot
[01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:41.660]  because they're early adopters.
[01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:45.380]  I wonder, I mean, it certainly is a,
[01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:47.900]  there's no mistaking it as a new phone, right?
[01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:50.180]  I mean, it is definite,
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:52.980]  if you want somebody,
[01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:53.940]  if you want people to know
[01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:56.540]  that you have a very expensive new phone,
[01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:58.460]  that these are the ones to get.
[01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:02.900]  Let me just unfold my phone and give you that answer.
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:06.780]  I personally, I'm intrigued enough
[01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:07.940]  that it's a topic on the show
[01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:11.180]  and I've linked to them both and I'm following along,
[01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:14.860]  but I'm also convinced that neither one of these
[01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:18.380]  really should be considered more than a shipping prototype.
[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:20.140]  I should have mentioned there was a third one there
[01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:21.500]  that got much less attention,
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:24.180]  LG because they hadn't made a folding phone,
[01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:26.380]  they made a case with a second display
[01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:27.500]  that you put your phone in
[01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:29.740]  and then it essentially becomes a folding phone.
[01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:31.220]  And the case is really expensive
[01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:33.220]  because it has that second display in it.
[01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:35.340]  But then there must be a gap or something, right?
[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:38.060]  Yes, there's like a hinge in the middle.
[01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:41.380]  So it's two discrete screens.
[01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:45.220]  It raises some questions.
[01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:48.660]  So with Samsung's, any design
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:53.020]  where the folding display folds in and on itself,
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:55.700]  and then you have, they put an extra display
[01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:57.020]  therefore on the outside,
[01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:58.900]  so there'd be something you can see
[01:22:58.900 --> 01:22:59.740]  while the phone is folded.
[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:01.580]  And a small one with these huge
[01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:04.180]  like inch and a half bezels on top and bottom too.
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:05.900]  Absolutely huge.
[01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:08.820]  I mean, almost hard to believe chin and forehead bezels.
[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:10.140]  Like not like, oh my God, we're back to the old-
[01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:12.580]  Like Frankenstein's monster chin and forehead bezels.
[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:15.540]  Right, not like the old iPhones
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:18.100]  before the iPhone 10 chin and forehead.
[01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:20.020]  We're talking way, way bigger.
[01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:21.940]  Like unlike anything you've ever seen.
[01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:26.940]  It's probably the lowest,
[01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:32.980]  what's the term, the screen to bezel ratio.
[01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:36.940]  It's gotta be the highest since like flip phones.
[01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:38.780]  And I can't tell if it's like components
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:40.380]  forced them to do that because it was just,
[01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:42.220]  they just couldn't bury them under the screen
[01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:43.580]  or they thought it was so thick
[01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:45.260]  they needed to make the screen smaller
[01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:46.540]  for you to be able to use it.
[01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:48.180]  I don't know what that was,
[01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:49.620]  which wouldn't dictated the other.
[01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:51.220]  Well, and how much of it was just price
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:52.900]  that bigger the display.
[01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:56.100]  I mean, clearly the idea with the Samsung One
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:24:00.540]  of their concept is that that small outer display
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:03.380]  in folded mode is really only meant
[01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:05.860]  for very quick casual use.
[01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:08.220]  In other words, oh, you have a notification,
[01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:09.140]  who's it from?
[01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:11.980]  Oh, my phone, somebody's calling me, who is it?
[01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:15.660]  I'm walking around, I can't stop and open it.
[01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:17.460]  I just wanna get a couple of quick things done.
[01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:21.660]  Yeah, I don't even know if the camera works in that mode.
[01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:23.460]  I don't even know if, you know.
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:25.180]  Yeah, there's a whole series of,
[01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:26.540]  that's the other thing is it's got a whole series
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:28.940]  of cameras on the back and then they have the biggest notch.
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:31.020]  Like it's so big, it's like a pirate patch
[01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:33.820]  on the inside for a whole bunch of internal cameras too.
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:36.540]  It's clearly the idea though
[01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:38.660]  is that anytime you're actually doing anything,
[01:24:38.660 --> 01:24:42.180]  you're going to take the phone and open it up and unfold it.
[01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:45.580]  But at a fundamental level,
[01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:50.580]  I think that the Huawei Audi design is better
[01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:53.620]  because there is no extra screen, right?
[01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:56.580]  It's just one screen and you only use half of it
[01:24:56.580 --> 01:24:58.620]  when you're in phone mode.
[01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:01.460]  It seems less wasteful.
[01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:03.940]  It's inelegant to have an extra screen.
[01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:06.780]  Yeah, it's more efficient but less protected
[01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:08.620]  because now that plastic screen,
[01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:10.540]  because there's no folding Gorilla Glass yet,
[01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:13.580]  is just always exposed to the outside world.
[01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:18.580]  In theory, I understand why nobody's really pulled this off
[01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:21.260]  and I understand why Apple hasn't done it.
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:23.100]  But in theory, it's wasteful
[01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:25.260]  that we even have front facing cameras.
[01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:27.660]  I mean, in theory, it would be nice if there was some way
[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:31.260]  that you could have one camera and then have it rotate
[01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:34.780]  so that whether you're facing the phone,
[01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:35.820]  taking a picture of yourself
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:37.180]  or taking a picture away from the phone,
[01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:38.580]  it would be the same camera.
[01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:43.300]  And in the same way, it's wasteful to have a second display
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:46.740]  that you only use when the phone is in a secondary mode.
[01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:47.580]  I get it though,
[01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:51.100]  that they wanted to have it fold in and of itself.
[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:51.940]  I don't know.
[01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:52.780]  Yeah, they wanted to make a book.
[01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:55.020]  Huawei has one camera system
[01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:56.100]  and it sort of does a pass through
[01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:59.100]  when you wanna take selfies or LCs.
[01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:03.260]  Well, and yeah, I wasn't sure how they did that.
[01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:06.380]  Neither of these seems super compelling to me though.
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:11.380]  And there's clearly a crease on the Huawei One.
[01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:14.220]  Both of them have a pass.
[01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:15.740]  You think like, how would you do this
[01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:18.060]  would not have some kind of crease?
[01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:20.260]  And the answer is, well, you don't.
[01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:23.580]  There is no magic way that this...
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:25.020]  And maybe someday we'll get there,
[01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:28.740]  but as of now, there's definitely a crease in the middle.
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:31.300]  That's on day one, these are the demo units.
[01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:32.720]  It's hard to imagine what it's gonna look like
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:34.380]  a month, two months, a year in.
[01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:35.220]  Right.
[01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:37.140]  Yeah, well, there's a real durability question
[01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:38.660]  with both of these,
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:40.900]  because especially with the Huawei
[01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:43.900]  where the main display is on the outside at all times.
[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:47.500]  And I don't know what percentage of people
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:50.140]  use their phone with no case.
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:52.780]  I suspect it's, I've talked about this before,
[01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:55.660]  I would guess it's 10% or fewer.
[01:26:56.740 --> 01:26:57.900]  And if you put a screen protector on,
[01:26:57.900 --> 01:26:59.420]  does that crease now as well?
[01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:00.260]  I mean like the whole thing.
[01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:01.100]  And how would you do it?
[01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:03.580]  Yeah, how would you do a screen protector?
[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:07.060]  And even, and I tend not to use a case.
[01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:09.620]  So I'm in that group that mostly,
[01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:12.740]  but I'm also always, as somebody who doesn't use a case,
[01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:16.260]  very cognizant of which side of my phone is the display
[01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:17.960]  and which is not.
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:20.940]  And if I'm ever setting it down on a surface,
[01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:24.380]  I tend to set it with the display up,
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:26.020]  so that it doesn't get scratched
[01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:28.580]  by something that might be on the table or surface.
[01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:32.820]  How do you do that when both sides are display?
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:35.300]  There is no lucky side to drop it on
[01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:36.260]  or to get a scratch on.
[01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:37.820]  You have to put it in.
[01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:40.180]  Yep, and combine that with the fact that both of these,
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:44.020]  because glass isn't yet flexible,
[01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:46.840]  they're both plastic screens, not glass,
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:50.780]  and possibly therefore more scratchable.
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:53.140]  Oh, absolutely, definitely more scratchable.
[01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:54.660]  You don't have to put it in an iPod sock
[01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:55.580]  the minute you close it.
[01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:59.200]  Right, it's, you know, so I don't know.
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:02.060]  I'm not sure that foldable phones will ever be a thing
[01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:05.940]  for some reason, including durability
[01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:09.140]  and the fact that people want to put them in cases.
[01:28:09.140 --> 01:28:12.960]  And if people want to put their $750 phones
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:16.660]  in a protective case, which is a totally sensible thing
[01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:19.580]  to do and way to think about it.
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:21.540]  Maybe I'm the idiot for not putting my phones
[01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:23.460]  in cases most of the time.
[01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:25.260]  I'll tell you what, if it's $2,000,
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:27.980]  it's only gonna increase their desire to put it in a case.
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:29.460]  And if the design of the phone is that way,
[01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:30.560]  you can't put it in a case
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:32.220]  because the whole gimmick is it unfolds.
[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:35.220]  I'm not sure that appeals to a lot of people.
[01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:36.500]  And I don't know how you get around that.
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:39.380]  How do you design a phone that can fold,
[01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:41.220]  whether it's an INI or an Audi,
[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:43.700]  and still be able to put it in a protective case?
[01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:44.540]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:47.340]  I mean, to me, this, I remember when I was at CES
[01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:49.220]  and they introduced the Galaxy Note for the first time
[01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:51.060]  and they put it on every table in this room
[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:52.980]  that we went into and we all picked them up
[01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:54.860]  and looked at them and the screens were horrible
[01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:57.260]  because no one really had good screen tech.
[01:28:57.260 --> 01:28:59.340]  I mean, there's one of the reasons Apple made the,
[01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:00.780]  one of the reasons Apple made the phone smaller
[01:29:00.780 --> 01:29:02.160]  was so you could hit it.
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.040]  But also that was literally the biggest size
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:06.140]  they could make the screen back then to a quality standard
[01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:07.940]  that they were found acceptable.
[01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:09.700]  But Samsung's like, they just stretched it out
[01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:10.540]  and it did not look good.
[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:13.260]  And that whole phone was deeply compromised.
[01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:14.940]  But flash forward a few years
[01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:17.100]  and we have really good big phones now.
[01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:19.800]  And that's a much easier problem set to solve for
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:21.380]  than the foldable phones.
[01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:22.740]  So I love the idea.
[01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:25.060]  I love the idea of having one thing that's my phone
[01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:26.860]  that can open up into a tablet.
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:28.980]  I think it's a brilliant idea.
[01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:33.020]  It has not been realized yet to say it like easily,
[01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:35.900]  but, and if it can never be realized well,
[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:38.740]  I will never buy one of them, but I hold out hope.
[01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:40.980]  You know, Apple, I heard about Apple experimenting
[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:43.140]  with the stuff I think back in the iPhone 4S days
[01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:45.060]  and obviously they're not happy with anything
[01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:46.500]  cause they haven't shipped anything yet.
[01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:49.740]  They have the resources and smarts
[01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:52.780]  to basically prototype anything that they want
[01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:53.940]  as often as they want.
[01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:54.980]  So my guess is, you know,
[01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:57.660]  that they don't find this technology acceptable yet either.
[01:29:57.660 --> 01:29:59.700]  I don't know if they ever will,
[01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:02.740]  but it is a compelling idea to have that one thing
[01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:03.580]  that you can just like,
[01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:04.980]  almost like the Star Trek thing.
[01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:06.100]  It's just a very,
[01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:08.660]  people have been folding wallets and books for millennia.
[01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:10.220]  It's something we're very used to.
[01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:13.520]  Well, the, to me, the canonical sci-fi
[01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:19.860]  prototype for this are the devices in Westworld.
[01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:21.500]  I mentioned this last week with Glenn,
[01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:24.320]  but you know, Westworld has these,
[01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:27.420]  the, what's the name of the company?
[01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:30.100]  I don't know.
[01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:32.280]  Basic idea of Westworld for those who aren't familiar
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:34.260]  is that it's like a, at some point,
[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:37.060]  unnamed point in the somewhat near future,
[01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:40.700]  there's a theme park you can go to where it's,
[01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:44.260]  you're just, you get put into a cowboy outfit
[01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:46.380]  and you're, you know, it's like the real,
[01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:50.420]  the Wild West come to life and you just get to be a...
[01:30:50.420 --> 01:30:52.180]  It's an old Michael Crichton movie
[01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:53.620]  that they remade for TV.
[01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:54.700]  Right, and it's really good.
[01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:55.540]  It's on HBO.
[01:30:55.540 --> 01:30:57.160]  I really enjoy it tremendously,
[01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:00.180]  but the employees of the theme park use these
[01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:05.180]  tablet computers that fold to be, you know,
[01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:08.420]  like cell phone size and are completely usable,
[01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:09.780]  folded or unfolded.
[01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:11.420]  So you can, you know, put it in a pocket,
[01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:14.460]  fold it, take it out and use it if you just want to use it,
[01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:15.860]  but then you can unfold it.
[01:31:15.860 --> 01:31:16.700]  And they're, you know,
[01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:18.860]  maybe like the thickness of a credit card.
[01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:19.820]  Yeah.
[01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:21.460]  So they're very, very thin.
[01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:26.700]  You know, just, you know, that future dream
[01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:30.940]  of just having a device that is just a screen,
[01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:34.860]  no thicker than the screen and everything is just in there.
[01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:37.260]  And they look great.
[01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:39.020]  They do a great job with the user interface.
[01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:41.220]  I guess if there's anything I would gripe about,
[01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:44.460]  it seems to me like they make the user interface too small.
[01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:46.020]  I think that if you actually saw
[01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:49.380]  that much information density in a device,
[01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:50.500]  it would be untouchable.
[01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:52.940]  Like it wouldn't be, it's unsuited to touch,
[01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:54.860]  but you know, it's the sort of thing where
[01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:58.740]  it makes it look more sci-fi to have more information on.
[01:31:58.740 --> 01:32:02.140]  So I would bet that they're fully aware
[01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:05.220]  that it's actually an unusable
[01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:08.220]  for touch information density, but looks cool.
[01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:09.420]  So it looks cooler.
[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:11.380]  So therefore they went with that direction.
[01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:13.980]  But anyway, they fold and unfold exactly
[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:17.380]  the way in theory,
[01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:20.380]  one would want their phone to fold and unfold.
[01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:23.300]  So you can get a tablet size computer whenever you need it
[01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:25.500]  and use a phone size thing when you don't.
[01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:28.340]  Yeah, if Xiaomi had this,
[01:32:28.340 --> 01:32:29.820]  they haven't actually shown the phone off yet,
[01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:32.300]  but their CEO was using a phone that was a tablet
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:35.180]  and you fold both the left and the right side in behind it
[01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:36.260]  and that becomes your phone.
[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:37.580]  So they're always experimenting
[01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:38.940]  with all sorts of crazy stuff.
[01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:40.060]  It is an interesting idea.
[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:44.060]  Would you, are these things, are they phones that unfold
[01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:45.740]  or are they tablets that fold up?
[01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:46.780]  Yeah, that fold.
[01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:50.580]  Right, and it also speaks to sort of the problems
[01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:52.460]  these companies are dealing with
[01:32:52.460 --> 01:32:56.660]  where Android is a lot better for phones
[01:32:56.660 --> 01:32:58.100]  than it is for tablets.
[01:32:58.100 --> 01:32:59.620]  I mean, I don't even think that's,
[01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:02.900]  I think even Android proponents would agree with that,
[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:05.900]  that Android, however much you might like it
[01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:07.620]  as your phone operating system,
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:11.820]  it's never really done a great job on tablets.
[01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:13.980]  Even Google seems to acknowledge that
[01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:17.180]  by moving more towards Chrome as the OS
[01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:21.100]  for their tablet size devices than Android.
[01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:22.780]  But if Android isn't good at being a tablet,
[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:24.100]  then what's the point of having a phone
[01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:26.940]  that opens up to tablet size?
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:29.100]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:32.620]  In theory, iOS would be a lot better at this than Android.
[01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:34.820]  I was thinking about it too
[01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:36.900]  because you have the size classes already.
[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:39.100]  So you just have a regular size class
[01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:41.220]  and when it opens up, it takes on,
[01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:42.540]  sorry, you have the compact size class,
[01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:44.380]  it opens up, becomes a regular size class
[01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:46.620]  with the same kind of mechanics that you have
[01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:47.780]  in iOS and iPad apps
[01:33:47.780 --> 01:33:49.500]  and you already have all those universal binaries.
[01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:51.660]  So their software story at least is,
[01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:53.260]  I think, much cleaner at this point.
[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:54.460]  Yeah.
[01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:55.300]  I don't know.
[01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:56.500]  I don't think either of these are going to,
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:57.540]  I don't think we're,
[01:33:57.540 --> 01:33:59.900]  my question is will they be popular enough
[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:02.020]  that you'll actually maybe see one this year?
[01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:03.540]  Like will somebody, will I get an email
[01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:05.100]  from somebody by the end of year and say,
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:08.100]  hey, I actually saw somebody with the Galaxy Fold
[01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:11.140]  at the mall and wherever, Peoria.
[01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:12.500]  I don't know.
[01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:15.180]  Like I don't even know if these things are realistic,
[01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:17.700]  real products enough that we're even going to see them,
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:19.420]  let alone be using them.
[01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:23.460]  Yeah, I think right now, again, these are like,
[01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:25.340]  unlike Apple, Apple keeps their prototypes
[01:34:25.340 --> 01:34:26.780]  and their shame internal.
[01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:29.420]  These companies are very happy to sort of put them in public
[01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:30.780]  and I think it benefits Apple too,
[01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:32.700]  because, you know, Apple got to watch 10 years
[01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:35.460]  of smartphones of Blackberries and Poms and Windows Mobile
[01:34:35.460 --> 01:34:36.860]  and figure out what problems they had
[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:37.940]  and how Apple could solve them.
[01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:39.580]  Same thing with tablet PC,
[01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:41.300]  same thing with the different watch brands
[01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:43.580]  and this, everyone's going to watch these.
[01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:45.380]  They'll have the same discussions that we have
[01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:46.580]  and if you can solve a problem,
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:48.780]  you can make a better product, then they'll go
[01:34:48.780 --> 01:34:50.460]  and if they're just flawed by nature,
[01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:51.860]  then there'll be no go.
[01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:55.660]  Well, the idea of flexible displays is fascinating
[01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:59.780]  because we've, you know, from the CRT
[01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:04.340]  until very recently, displays were anything but flexible.
[01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:06.420]  They were completely inflexible,
[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:08.940]  typically would crack very easily
[01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:10.460]  if you tried to flex them.
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:15.780]  What, you know, Apple's take on this
[01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:17.420]  and, you know, one of the first ways
[01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:20.260]  that these flexible OLEDs have been used
[01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:23.980]  in Samsung's case is to fold a little bit of the screen
[01:35:23.980 --> 01:35:25.820]  over the side of the display
[01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:30.900]  and they had some weird UI experiments
[01:35:30.900 --> 01:35:33.660]  where they would show notifications in that area,
[01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:35.340]  you know, sort of like, what do they call them?
[01:35:35.340 --> 01:35:37.700]  Chyrons, Chyrons, like on TV, you know,
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:41.260]  like the little ticker tape thing at the bottom of CNN
[01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:43.580]  or MSNBC or ESPN.
[01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:45.100]  It was like putting a little colored note sticker
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:46.500]  on the outside of your book.
[01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:49.700]  I've never found that very compelling.
[01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:54.100]  It kind of looks cool because it's literally edge to edge
[01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:56.460]  and there's no bezel at all on the side.
[01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:59.060]  So it looks good in a product photograph,
[01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:02.180]  but I've never understood the point of having it
[01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:03.300]  because you can't hold the phone
[01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:05.740]  without covering up that part of it.
[01:36:05.740 --> 01:36:09.620]  Apple obviously isn't impressed with that design,
[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:13.060]  but the one area where Apple has used flexible displays
[01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:17.260]  so far is in the iPhone X and now the XS and XS Max,
[01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:19.500]  where they use the flexible nature of the OLED
[01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:24.060]  to curve the display at the,
[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:26.020]  I think it's just the top and bottom.
[01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:26.860]  Yeah.
[01:36:26.860 --> 01:36:29.060]  But you don't, it's only to make,
[01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:32.500]  they're using the flexible nature of OLED
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:37.500]  to make the iPhone X and XS displays go,
[01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:40.780]  you know, from the top to bottom with no chin or forehead
[01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:43.460]  or minimal, minimal bezel that's the same
[01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:45.140]  as it is on the side,
[01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:47.300]  the flexible part is completely hidden from view
[01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:49.140]  so you don't see it as flex.
[01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:51.460]  It's just that that's the implementation detail
[01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:54.620]  of how they made it look like it goes all the way
[01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:55.980]  from the top and bottom.
[01:36:55.980 --> 01:36:56.820]  So I think that's-
[01:36:56.820 --> 01:36:58.060]  Instead of plugging into the module underneath it,
[01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:00.380]  forcing a chin, it can go, sorry, on the bottom of it,
[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:02.860]  it goes underneath it, therefore hiding the chin,
[01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:05.300]  well, relieving the responsibility of making the chin area.
[01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:09.660]  Right, well over 99% of all iPhone X owners
[01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:12.060]  have no idea that they're using a display
[01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:14.580]  that is flexed under the bottom and top
[01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:16.580]  because it doesn't look like it at all.
[01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:17.820]  Yeah, totally.
[01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:20.620]  It's fascinating and it's such a difference to me
[01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:23.540]  that Apple, you know, is using this expensive
[01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:25.620]  state of the art flexible screen technology
[01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:28.100]  in a way that completely hides the fact
[01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:29.900]  that it's flexible at all.
[01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:31.380]  Like an implementation detail.
[01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:33.860]  Right, but that to me is so super appley
[01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:37.300]  whereas like the initial Samsung thing was,
[01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:38.660]  look at this, it's flexible,
[01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:39.980]  look, it bends around the side.
[01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:42.140]  Like it couldn't be more in your face
[01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:44.420]  that, hey, this is a flexible display.
[01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:47.660]  It goes back to that old Steve Jobs speech
[01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:49.700]  when he said that we never want to look at a technology
[01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:50.620]  and figure out how to use it.
[01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:51.780]  We want to figure out a product
[01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:53.900]  and then find the technology that enables it.
[01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:54.740]  I have a-
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:55.580]  And they wanted to-
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:57.900]  Yep, it's such a great quote, yeah.
[01:37:57.900 --> 01:38:00.380]  Yeah, like they never looked at NFC and said,
[01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:01.500]  hey, we ought to put this radio in there.
[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:03.460]  Like we need Apple Pay, what component?
[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:06.420]  It's not a chip set, it's a feature set for them.
[01:38:06.420 --> 01:38:09.420]  I had a friend who until recently worked at Apple
[01:38:09.420 --> 01:38:12.820]  and his remark upon seeing the,
[01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:15.020]  I think the first of the, I think it was the Samsung one.
[01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:18.100]  He goes, that's a total, he just said the same thing.
[01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:20.020]  That's a total Steve Jobs.
[01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:21.660]  That's a technology, not a product.
[01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:22.500]  Yes.
[01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:26.020]  Somebody at Samsung was like, look, we could do this.
[01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:27.900]  And then they said, okay, build a phone that does that.
[01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:30.300]  Whereas nobody would really think,
[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:33.460]  hey, let's build a display with a big crease in the middle.
[01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:35.060]  Like I went to a CES this year
[01:38:35.060 --> 01:38:37.580]  and I saw the fruit roll-up TV from LG.
[01:38:37.580 --> 01:38:39.660]  And at first I thought, this is a brilliant idea
[01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:42.220]  because it'll just roll up to fit whatever aspect ratio
[01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:43.780]  of the content you want to watch.
[01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:46.300]  Like if it's a 16 by nine show, it'll go to 16 by nine.
[01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:49.180]  But if you're watching Lawrence of Arabia,
[01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:50.340]  it'll give you like this, no,
[01:38:50.340 --> 01:38:53.220]  you'll never have to worry about bars or anything again.
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:55.020]  And they're like, nope, it's got two modes,
[01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:58.180]  partially up for alarm clock, all the way up for TV.
[01:38:58.180 --> 01:38:59.020]  That's it.
[01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:01.100]  Like then why use the technology?
[01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:04.700]  Well, I didn't think about,
[01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:06.500]  that one I'm a little bit more,
[01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:07.500]  I was actually going to bring that up.
[01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:11.140]  I actually feel like that LG rollable TV,
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:17.100]  it's interesting to me if the nature of the room
[01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:19.780]  you want to put it in is such that
[01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:21.540]  you don't want a TV up all the time.
[01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:22.380]  Sure.
[01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:23.380]  I don't know what that is.
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:27.820]  I like, I'm not a hide the TV person.
[01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:32.620]  I'm a, look, I don't know, maybe, I don't know.
[01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:34.520]  If you had a penthouse overlooking the city
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:36.140]  and you didn't want it to obstruct your view
[01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:38.100]  until you wanted to watch the game.
[01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:38.940]  Right.
[01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:42.500]  And one time, many years ago,
[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:45.300]  I got an upgrade at Bellagio in Vegas
[01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:48.500]  and got a room that had a TV at the foot of the bed.
[01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:49.860]  Yeah.
[01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:53.340]  And you hit a button and it would rise out.
[01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:54.980]  And apparently Oprah Winfrey has had
[01:39:54.980 --> 01:39:55.900]  one of these for a long time.
[01:39:55.900 --> 01:39:58.700]  My wife was very excited about that.
[01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:00.660]  It's very cool, but it really,
[01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:05.660]  it required a TV size box at the foot of the bed
[01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:11.380]  because it would, you know, the TV didn't,
[01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:13.500]  there was a TV that was there all the time.
[01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:16.620]  It just would go into this box and then you'd hit a button
[01:40:16.620 --> 01:40:19.180]  and it would pop out of the box so you could see it.
[01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:23.300]  In a case like that, the LG thing would be way more elegant,
[01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:26.020]  you know, where it folds up into a little tiny box.
[01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:29.980]  It doesn't have to, you know, I don't know.
[01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:31.900]  I'm sure we'll see it.
[01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:34.220]  And I'm seeing them in advertising contexts
[01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:35.400]  all over the place, you know,
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:37.700]  that there's foldable displays that people
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:39.380]  are putting up along the sides of buildings
[01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:40.220]  and stuff like that.
[01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:41.900]  I mean, it's clearly the future.
[01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:43.000]  Well, the room at CES, you went in there,
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.460]  the displays just curved up every side.
[01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:47.300]  Like you even saw that in the Samsung event.
[01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:48.940]  It looked like almost like a Celtic cross.
[01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:51.420]  They had the displays folded around.
[01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:52.260]  Yeah.
[01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:55.220]  I think it's, I think the initial uses
[01:40:55.220 --> 01:40:58.780]  that make a lot of sense are in industrial,
[01:40:58.780 --> 01:41:02.780]  maybe that's the wrong word, but, you know, installations,
[01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:06.520]  you know, like lobby, like if you're gonna use a display,
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:10.160]  big displays to decorate the lobby of your fancy new hotel,
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:13.340]  using flexible displays would be way cooler.
[01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:17.880]  Like it would be like if you have circular columns
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:20.380]  in your building, it would be kind of amazing
[01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:24.440]  to make a seamless display that wraps around the column
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:28.020]  in a, you know, in a cylinder, a cylindrical display.
[01:41:28.020 --> 01:41:30.620]  There's all sorts of ways that flexible displays
[01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:33.780]  could look cool, but I think in consumer technology,
[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:37.140]  we haven't seen anything yet that's really compelling.
[01:41:37.140 --> 01:41:38.460]  Yeah, no, agreed.
[01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:40.380]  And again, it is an interesting difference with Apple
[01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:43.900]  where Apple isn't going to show a cruddy flexible phone
[01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:45.980]  that they don't want anybody to actually buy yet
[01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:47.900]  just so they can say first.
[01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:51.540]  Yeah, yeah, first is not in their vocabulary.
[01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:54.260]  Right, you could almost see it at Samsung's event
[01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:58.180]  that it's like the consumer technology equivalent
[01:41:58.180 --> 01:42:01.660]  of being in the YouTube comments and writing first.
[01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:03.740]  And Huawei did the same thing first.
[01:42:03.740 --> 01:42:06.500]  And like, we just saw the Samsung one last week, but okay.
[01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:09.180]  And it was a Royale Flex Pi at CES, which was just horrible.
[01:42:09.180 --> 01:42:11.440]  I mean, they're all making these now,
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:12.860]  which was also funny because there were a bunch of people
[01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:14.780]  who said only Samsung could make this.
[01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:15.720]  They're so far ahead.
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:17.540]  They've got years and years of lead.
[01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:18.780]  No one else can make this fold.
[01:42:18.780 --> 01:42:21.180]  And then it was like eight of them showed up.
[01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:22.300]  Yeah, I saw that.
[01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:24.900]  I saw that there was a note, speaking of Goldman Sachs,
[01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:27.380]  where Goldman Sachs had a note saying that,
[01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:31.180]  I think it was overblown, the reaction.
[01:42:31.180 --> 01:42:34.540]  I think if you actually read the note, it was just if,
[01:42:34.540 --> 01:42:39.000]  and I think that if needs to be in all caps,
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.220]  bold and italics.
[01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:45.240]  If foldable phones become a thing,
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:48.060]  Samsung might have a serious leg up on Apple
[01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:50.840]  because Samsung produces their own screen technology.
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:55.660]  And Apple is a buyer of screen technology made by others.
[01:42:55.660 --> 01:42:57.380]  And I think that's actually a valid point.
[01:42:57.380 --> 01:42:58.720]  I think that, you know.
[01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:01.780]  Well, we see that now with the iPhone 10 and 10S
[01:43:01.780 --> 01:43:03.260]  that Samsung just charges them a fortune
[01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:04.220]  for those displays.
[01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:05.060]  Right.
[01:43:05.060 --> 01:43:07.580]  And I don't, at this point, nobody else can make them.
[01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:10.700]  Nobody else is making an OLED that meets Apple's
[01:43:10.700 --> 01:43:15.300]  exacting demands for color accuracy and et cetera, et cetera.
[01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:16.140]  It is interesting though.
[01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:19.240]  There is, you know, and you see it with Samsung's devices
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:20.520]  and they're in a weird place,
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:23.900]  but to some degrees it's interesting that
[01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:25.860]  Samsung's really the only other company
[01:43:25.860 --> 01:43:29.740]  that can say that they follow the Tim Cook mantra
[01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:32.500]  of owning and controlling the core technologies
[01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:34.020]  of their devices.
[01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:36.980]  I mean, Samsung can do their own CPUs
[01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:38.780]  and they do make their own displays.
[01:43:40.420 --> 01:43:41.540]  I mean, Huawei is like that.
[01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:42.700]  They make the Kirin processor,
[01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:45.260]  they even make the cell phone towers that it runs off of,
[01:43:45.260 --> 01:43:48.420]  but they're just not gonna be sold in the US at any point.
[01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:52.060]  All right, let me take a break
[01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:56.020]  and thank our third final sponsor of the episode.
[01:43:56.020 --> 01:43:59.760]  It is our good friends at Squarespace.
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:03.380]  I talk about Squarespace at least every other episode.
[01:44:03.380 --> 01:44:07.780]  They are one of the most long running sponsors of this show.
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:11.900]  The reason why is because people keep signing up
[01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:14.420]  to build new websites or update old websites
[01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:17.500]  and move them to a new platform on Squarespace
[01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:19.620]  using the code from the show.
[01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:24.580]  It's really a great service.
[01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:29.580]  It does everything you need a web hosting provider to offer
[01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:35.580]  from domain name registration to templates,
[01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:38.580]  dozens and dozens of professionally designed templates
[01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:43.540]  in a variety of styles that scale
[01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:45.100]  from everything from phones
[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:48.180]  to big desktop displays responsibly,
[01:44:48.180 --> 01:44:52.180]  all of them customizable so that you can make them your own
[01:44:52.180 --> 01:44:53.800]  and put your own brand on it
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:55.660]  and not have it look like a cookie cutter site,
[01:44:55.660 --> 01:44:57.260]  like, oh, that's another Squarespace site
[01:44:57.260 --> 01:44:59.700]  using the blank template or something like that.
[01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:01.860]  You visit sites every single day,
[01:45:01.860 --> 01:45:04.040]  I guarantee it, that are built on Squarespace
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:07.380]  and you have no idea because Squarespace is so popular
[01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:12.040]  and it's so customizable and so easy to make it your own
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:14.780]  and put your own brand for your company or yourself
[01:45:14.780 --> 01:45:16.980]  or whatever it is you're making a website for
[01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:22.940]  and just beautiful and everything from,
[01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:25.160]  you wanna have a blog, you wanna have a podcast,
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:27.880]  you wanna do something, you wanna have a store
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:29.780]  where you sell stuff and do e-commerce,
[01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:32.220]  all of that stuff is all built in
[01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:35.940]  to the Squarespace platform and you just do it all
[01:45:35.940 --> 01:45:39.440]  from designing the site to checking the analytics
[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:41.080]  and seeing who's visiting your site
[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:43.220]  and what parts of the site people are using
[01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:45.420]  to actually updating the site and posting things
[01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:48.640]  like blog entries or adding items to your store.
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:50.900]  All of it, you do it all through Squarespace.
[01:45:50.900 --> 01:45:53.060]  Check them out next time you need to build a website
[01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:54.700]  or next time you take an old website
[01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:57.020]  and wanna update it to a new platform.
[01:45:57.020 --> 01:45:57.860]  Where do you go?
[01:45:57.860 --> 01:45:59.940]  Go to squarespace.com and remember this code,
[01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:02.940]  talk show at checkout when you do buy
[01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:06.820]  after you use up your free trial period,
[01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:08.780]  you get 10% off and you can do that
[01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:12.500]  for prepaying up to a full year in advance, save 10%.
[01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:15.140]  That's the code, talk show, no the, just talk show.
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:18.260]  Go to squarespace.com slash talk show
[01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:19.760]  and you can get started today.
[01:46:22.140 --> 01:46:23.780]  What else is on our agenda, Rene?
[01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:29.740]  Double, God, Secret Lives of Facebook Moderators in America.
[01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:31.060]  This was a great story.
[01:46:31.060 --> 01:46:32.700]  I still haven't linked to it from during Fireball
[01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:36.460]  because it was really a great story
[01:46:36.460 --> 01:46:39.320]  by Casey Newton at The Verge.
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:42.720]  I really want, probably the most compelling thing
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:47.720]  I've read all week, talking about this company
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:50.840]  that is sort of like a contractor for Facebook
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:53.080]  to do moderation here in the US.
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:55.520]  So it's not Facebook employees,
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:58.100]  it's, what's the name of this company here?
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:03.560]  Cognizant, C-O-G-N-I-C-A-N-T.
[01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:05.760]  They have an office in, I guess somewhere in Arizona
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:08.400]  and people come in, you get this job
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:12.440]  and it sounds, it's almost dystopian.
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:15.320]  I mean, maybe I should take out the word almost.
[01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:20.320]  It's dystopian and apparently that is not like,
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:23.420]  like one of the bragging points that they make
[01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:26.880]  is that it's, they have windows
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:29.440]  and it's like a nice, it's not some dank basement.
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:35.160]  So maybe that aspect of it isn't dystopic,
[01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:39.960]  dystopian, I forget the word, but in terms
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:42.440]  of what it's like to work there, it is,
[01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:46.480]  it's like you check in, you have to leave your phone,
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:48.800]  you can't have any paper or pencils
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:52.720]  because they don't want people like writing down.
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:54.020]  Like Casey.
[01:47:54.020 --> 01:47:55.960]  Right, they don't want people writing down the names
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:59.280]  of the people involved in the things that they're doing.
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:02.160]  They micromanage your bathroom breaks
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:05.620]  and you're expected to go through hundreds
[01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:10.620]  of disputed flagged things on Facebook every day,
[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:14.180]  whether it's, you know, identifying
[01:48:14.180 --> 01:48:18.300]  whether somebody's rant is racist
[01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:20.820]  or whether there's, you know, somebody posts,
[01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:23.260]  they post just the worst stuff you can imagine,
[01:48:23.260 --> 01:48:28.260]  videos of people being killed by drones in the Middle East
[01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:33.260]  and obviously it's, I'm sure tons of pornographic stuff.
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:36.480]  Yeah.
[01:48:39.020 --> 01:48:41.320]  And you just have to go through hundreds of these things
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:46.320]  and they get in big trouble if you're, you know,
[01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:48.900]  they audit, you know, a couple of dozen
[01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:50.820]  of your everybody's things a week
[01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:54.940]  and if yours don't match up with what they expect them to,
[01:48:54.940 --> 01:48:58.140]  you get in trouble, there's not much money in this,
[01:48:58.140 --> 01:49:00.980]  it seems like whether they only pay like $28,000 a year
[01:49:00.980 --> 01:49:02.360]  for a full-time employee.
[01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:05.960]  Yeah, they pay nothing and they just totally,
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:08.500]  and it sounds like these people are being destroyed,
[01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:11.900]  like emotionally, psychically, in every way possible.
[01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:14.600]  Right, because for 40 hours a week, every week,
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:17.660]  they are just looking at nothing but the worst,
[01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:20.260]  I mean, that's, you know, the stuff that's innocuous
[01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:23.100]  isn't getting flagged for moderation.
[01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:27.980]  So it's just 40 hours a day of evaluating the worst stuff
[01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:29.480]  posted to Facebook.
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:31.780]  Yeah, talk about one woman in the beginning
[01:49:31.780 --> 01:49:33.740]  who's just watching people getting murdered.
[01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:36.260]  Yeah, yeah, and she had like a panic attack
[01:49:36.260 --> 01:49:39.600]  and, you know, who can blame her?
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:44.600]  I mean, it's, you know, people aren't,
[01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:48.020]  most people aren't hooked up to consume stuff like that.
[01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:49.940]  Yeah, it's literally soul-crushing.
[01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:53.980]  Yeah, it's like snuff films and stuff, it's really crazy.
[01:49:53.980 --> 01:49:56.620]  So, Facebook.
[01:49:56.620 --> 01:50:00.860]  Yeah, player of the year.
[01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:01.940]  Well, you've mentioned this before,
[01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:06.480]  it's just like the, it's not a company
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:08.580]  that normal people work at, it's just not.
[01:50:09.660 --> 01:50:12.260]  I, you know, one of the things that was raised by,
[01:50:12.260 --> 01:50:14.220]  I mean, and, you know, one of the things
[01:50:14.220 --> 01:50:18.160]  that's a little morally questionable
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:20.200]  is the relationship Facebook has
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:21.780]  with these moderation companies like this,
[01:50:21.780 --> 01:50:24.460]  that they're keeping this at arm's reach
[01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:26.220]  and they're not making them full-time,
[01:50:26.220 --> 01:50:27.780]  they're not making them Facebook employees,
[01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:29.900]  they're employees of a company called Cognizant
[01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:31.860]  and they have a contract with Facebook.
[01:50:32.740 --> 01:50:34.980]  To me, there's a lack of ownership there, you know,
[01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:38.780]  that they should be full-time Facebook employees.
[01:50:38.780 --> 01:50:40.940]  You know, this is Facebook's problem,
[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:43.540]  this is the nature of their platform.
[01:50:43.540 --> 01:50:48.260]  Farming this out and, you know, to another company is,
[01:50:48.260 --> 01:50:52.240]  yeah, there's a certain lack of,
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:54.040]  I'm not surprised that that's how they do it,
[01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:59.040]  but there's, it seems like it's brushing it aside.
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:01.160]  Like this is something that they should know.
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:03.640]  To be clear, there was an expose a couple weeks ago
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:06.160]  about contract workers in Silicon Valley
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:09.120]  and it was Apple and Google and all the big companies
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:11.320]  and they were just, none of them were treated as well
[01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:12.300]  as employees would be treated.
[01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:15.360]  They were all micromanaged, they all hated their jobs
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:16.780]  and it's just not a good culture
[01:51:16.780 --> 01:51:20.000]  and it seems to be endemic in the area,
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.680]  but when you're dealing with material like this,
[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:25.440]  it seems to be especially, like verifying addresses
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:27.600]  for Apple or Google on a Maps app,
[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:29.480]  that's probably really boring work,
[01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:31.820]  but these people are again watching the absolute worst
[01:51:31.820 --> 01:51:35.000]  of humanity over and over again for nothing.
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.240]  Yeah, or not much.
[01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:40.740]  And it helps obscure things like, you know,
[01:51:40.740 --> 01:51:44.000]  what's the average salary of an employee at Facebook
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.680]  when all of these people making, here it is,
[01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:51.360]  $28,800 per year to evaluate this
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:52.680]  and there's, you know, I don't know,
[01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:54.440]  hundreds, thousands of these people,
[01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:58.540]  their low wages aren't bringing down
[01:51:58.540 --> 01:52:02.420]  the company-wide average salary employee at Facebook.
[01:52:04.300 --> 01:52:06.680]  You know, I saw some people in response to this saying,
[01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:10.700]  you know, and that, and they're right,
[01:52:10.700 --> 01:52:13.400]  I'm not disagreeing at all, that the problem is that these,
[01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:16.480]  this shows that, at least especially here in the US,
[01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:21.480]  that like mental health care isn't part of a lot of,
[01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:24.400]  even if you have health insurance,
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:28.600]  getting treated for the emotional problems
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:30.680]  that might develop doing a job like this
[01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:33.400]  should be part of your healthcare.
[01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:36.560]  I don't disagree with that at all, I agree with it, sure.
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:39.680]  But I feel like reading this article
[01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:43.040]  and coming away with the primary take that,
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:44.720]  hey, something's busted in our,
[01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:47.100]  another aspect of our healthcare system that's busted
[01:52:47.100 --> 01:52:48.300]  is that these people aren't getting
[01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:49.400]  the mental health care they need
[01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:51.520]  after dealing with this job.
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:53.760]  I think you're whistling past the primary problem,
[01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:56.640]  which is that this platform is assessable.
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:53:01.360]  And that they're, you know, I don't know what the answer is.
[01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:05.080]  You know, obviously disband Facebook and shut it down
[01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:08.760]  isn't going to happen, but let's let everybody
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:10.760]  on the planet post whatever they want
[01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:13.720]  and share it to like-minded individuals
[01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:15.700]  is fundamentally a broken idea.
[01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:21.200]  You know, to me, the fundamental idea of Facebook is broken.
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:25.600]  Like this is not a good idea, you know, and we're seeing it.
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:27.200]  You know, and I don't know what the answer is,
[01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:30.560]  but, and I'm not surprised in the least bit
[01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:34.360]  that keeping it moderated to the degree
[01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:39.360]  that it is moderated requires tremendous man hours
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:41.140]  to identify and flag this stuff.
[01:53:41.140 --> 01:53:44.620]  And even so they still are obviously struggling
[01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:47.080]  with the accuracy rate.
[01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:49.440]  You know, the article goes into the fact that these odd,
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:52.160]  you know, somebody, people from Facebook
[01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:55.320]  who actually are Facebook employees do these audits
[01:53:55.320 --> 01:54:00.320]  and you know, the goal is to have a 95% success rate.
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:01.580]  In other words that, you know,
[01:54:01.580 --> 01:54:03.640]  if you're having this job as a moderator,
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:09.960]  19 out of 20 times your assessment of this is acceptable,
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:12.520]  it should stay up or this is unacceptable,
[01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:13.740]  we should take it down,
[01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:16.000]  should agree with the person at Facebook.
[01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:21.980]  I'm not surprised at all that this is human driven
[01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:25.300]  on both ends, not algorithmically driven.
[01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:28.300]  I don't, you know, AI just isn't there yet to do this.
[01:54:28.300 --> 01:54:30.900]  I mean, I'm sure there's some stuff that AI can flag,
[01:54:30.900 --> 01:54:35.340]  just like the way that spam, email spam filters
[01:54:35.340 --> 01:54:39.440]  are largely, you know, almost entirely driven by software.
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:41.900]  Obviously some stuff like in the way that email
[01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:44.540]  can be filtered algorithmically can work,
[01:54:44.540 --> 01:54:48.180]  but deciding whether the content of a video is acceptable,
[01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:52.340]  that requires humans and it just doesn't scale.
[01:54:52.340 --> 01:54:53.940]  The scale is impossible to understand
[01:54:53.940 --> 01:54:55.900]  how much content goes into these platforms,
[01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:58.460]  Facebook, YouTube, all of these every second,
[01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:02.180]  not just every day, but every second it's unmanageable,
[01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:03.660]  let alone in total.
[01:55:05.060 --> 01:55:05.900]  You know, and it comes back,
[01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:07.740]  you mentioned that YouTube is, you know,
[01:55:07.740 --> 01:55:09.780]  to name the other giant in this,
[01:55:09.780 --> 01:55:13.600]  YouTube is in the midst of a couple of controversies,
[01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:18.260]  but the one that I saw last week was one involving
[01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:22.500]  effectively pedophiles who are looking at videos
[01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:25.420]  of young, mostly young girls,
[01:55:25.420 --> 01:55:29.820]  and the algorithmic angle on this,
[01:55:29.820 --> 01:55:30.940]  because I don't think it would take off,
[01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:34.700]  is that once you get into this rabbit hole of these videos,
[01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:37.700]  all of your suggested videos over on the right hand side
[01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:40.340]  of YouTube are more of them.
[01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:44.680]  And it's awful, awful, awful, awful stuff.
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:45.820]  But part of it, you know,
[01:55:45.820 --> 01:55:48.660]  part of it is the algorithm not flagging it,
[01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:50.020]  you know, being smart enough,
[01:55:50.020 --> 01:55:51.060]  the algorithm is smart enough
[01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:53.680]  to stitch these videos together and say,
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:56.660]  okay, if you like this, you'll like that.
[01:55:56.660 --> 01:56:00.420]  And they're right or correct, I should say, you know,
[01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:03.580]  in that these are related videos from the same people,
[01:56:03.580 --> 01:56:05.820]  but it's obviously wrong in the moral sense
[01:56:05.820 --> 01:56:09.140]  that these things should ever be allowed to propagate.
[01:56:10.060 --> 01:56:11.940]  And quite frankly,
[01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:16.940]  ultimately gets to the bottom line of unmoderated comments
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:20.220]  are never end well on the internet.
[01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:21.420]  Yes.
[01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:23.220]  You know, and it's awful to say it.
[01:56:23.220 --> 01:56:25.660]  And I realized that from a philosophical standpoint,
[01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:30.660]  a democratization of, you know, free speech in theory,
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:33.180]  it's great that the internet allows everybody
[01:56:33.180 --> 01:56:34.020]  to have a voice,
[01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:37.140]  but in practice there's enough awful people in the world
[01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:42.140]  that having an unmoderated forum, it never ends well.
[01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:44.300]  Well, you also remember like the early days of the internet,
[01:56:44.300 --> 01:56:46.740]  like I used to run my own PHP Nuke and WordPress
[01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:48.180]  and movable type installations,
[01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:50.220]  and there would always be a vulnerability
[01:56:50.220 --> 01:56:53.020]  where there were porn links put in or spam links put in
[01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:56.020]  or malware links put in just on an automated basis.
[01:56:56.020 --> 01:56:57.860]  And I would end up destroying the comment system
[01:56:57.860 --> 01:56:59.160]  just because I couldn't keep up.
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:01.620]  And I was getting a trivial amount of comments.
[01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:04.260]  Yeah, I mean, one rule of thumb
[01:57:04.260 --> 01:57:06.820]  is that anything that can be abused will be abused.
[01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:07.660]  Yes.
[01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:09.740]  You know, and it's inevitable, you know?
[01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:14.740]  So letters to the editor in your local printed newspaper
[01:57:14.740 --> 01:57:17.700]  never had spam because there was no,
[01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:20.140]  and I really doubt that there was much spam
[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:21.540]  ever sent to the newspapers
[01:57:21.540 --> 01:57:24.060]  because you know it's not gonna get printed, right?
[01:57:24.060 --> 01:57:27.280]  Somebody is reading these letters and deciding,
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:29.700]  here's six letters about our recent news coverage
[01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:33.620]  and current events that show different perspectives
[01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:35.220]  and interesting points.
[01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:36.700]  Here's our six letters of the day.
[01:57:36.700 --> 01:57:37.900]  It's all human curated,
[01:57:37.900 --> 01:57:42.360]  so there was never any impetus to abuse it.
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:43.200]  Whereas-
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:44.020]  It has to be delusional,
[01:57:44.020 --> 01:57:46.740]  not opportunistic to just send in nonsense.
[01:57:46.740 --> 01:57:49.660]  Right, whereas we've created an automated system
[01:57:49.660 --> 01:57:51.840]  where anybody can fill out this text area for them
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:54.820]  and hit a button and whatever you typed in the field
[01:57:54.820 --> 01:57:57.380]  is going to show up at the bottom of this post.
[01:57:57.380 --> 01:58:02.380]  So it did not take long for that to be taken advantage of.
[01:58:03.860 --> 01:58:07.740]  What was the six apart thing track backs?
[01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:08.560]  Yeah.
[01:58:09.620 --> 01:58:10.900]  Which weren't comments.
[01:58:10.900 --> 01:58:12.740]  It was like, it was never-
[01:58:12.740 --> 01:58:14.820]  If you blogged it, they would put the link
[01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:17.000]  to what you blogged about it in the comments.
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.540]  I never supported it at Daring Fireball
[01:58:19.540 --> 01:58:22.660]  along the lines of why I never had comments
[01:58:22.660 --> 01:58:24.640]  at Daring Fireball is I just never wanted to,
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:28.020]  I saw the problem all along and never, you know.
[01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:29.780]  And again, it's like many things in life,
[01:58:29.780 --> 01:58:32.660]  there are trade-offs where if you don't have comments,
[01:58:32.660 --> 01:58:34.220]  you don't get the good comments either.
[01:58:34.220 --> 01:58:36.260]  And sometimes the comments are the best thing
[01:58:36.260 --> 01:58:38.320]  or somebody could make a point
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:40.860]  that it was better than the post itself, you know.
[01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:44.100]  Like Asimko's comments are terrific,
[01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:45.460]  but I have no idea what he goes through
[01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:47.120]  in order to maintain that quality.
[01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:48.460]  Right, well, it's-
[01:58:48.460 --> 01:58:51.680]  It's quite steady. Human moderated, right.
[01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:54.420]  But track backs were like an automated way
[01:58:54.420 --> 01:58:57.000]  of linking an article or one post to another
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:02.000]  and saying like, oh, Renee posted about the Galaxy Fold
[01:59:02.340 --> 01:59:03.860]  and I'm responding to his posts
[01:59:03.860 --> 01:59:05.100]  and I'd put a track back in
[01:59:05.100 --> 01:59:08.180]  and then somehow there would be a link to my post
[01:59:08.180 --> 01:59:10.960]  at the bottom of your post because I sent the track back.
[01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:13.100]  Well, it didn't take long for those to be abused.
[01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:13.940]  They were all scrapers.
[01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:15.300]  Yeah, like people who just scraped your content
[01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:16.300]  were all in your talk backs.
[01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:18.220]  Right, it wasn't, you know,
[01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:20.840]  it was, you needed to write like a script to do it
[01:59:20.840 --> 01:59:23.620]  because it was like a little simple API call.
[01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:26.100]  It wasn't just typing in a text area and hitting a button,
[01:59:26.100 --> 01:59:29.120]  but it was easily automated and of course it was.
[01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:31.660]  Here's my question.
[01:59:31.660 --> 01:59:33.460]  What is the point of YouTube comments?
[01:59:34.620 --> 01:59:36.020]  I guess they would,
[01:59:36.020 --> 01:59:38.380]  well, I guess there's a couple of reasons why they do it
[01:59:38.380 --> 01:59:39.300]  and it's the same reasons
[01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:40.540]  that there've always been comments on the web.
[01:59:40.540 --> 01:59:42.140]  One is to provide an open forum
[01:59:42.140 --> 01:59:43.500]  for discussion of the content.
[01:59:43.500 --> 01:59:45.180]  The other one is that when there are comments
[01:59:45.180 --> 01:59:47.160]  and people argue in them, you get way more page views
[01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:49.600]  because people come back, not just to see the content again,
[01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:52.900]  but to see what the discussion around the content is.
[01:59:52.900 --> 01:59:53.900]  And if they get into arguments,
[01:59:53.900 --> 01:59:56.140]  they come back again and again and again.
[01:59:57.180 --> 01:59:58.980]  Do your videos get a lot of comment?
[02:00:00.820 --> 02:00:02.780]  Yeah, I mean, like they get way more comments
[02:00:02.780 --> 02:00:05.580]  than I've seen in blogs or Twitter or anything a long time
[02:00:05.580 --> 02:00:07.520]  because YouTube has an incredible, and it's good and bad.
[02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:11.100]  Like there are horrible comments that I delete.
[02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:13.300]  Like I don't delete, you know, anyone arguing with me,
[02:00:13.300 --> 02:00:16.020]  but there are like some gross things that get posted in there
[02:00:16.020 --> 02:00:17.500]  so I get rid of that.
[02:00:17.500 --> 02:00:20.540]  But there are tons of comments on a lot of them, yeah.
[02:00:20.540 --> 02:00:22.580]  Yeah, that is the one thing about YouTube comments
[02:00:22.580 --> 02:00:27.580]  is I never look, I'm so anti-comment that I don't even look.
[02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:30.300]  Like I watch a fair amount,
[02:00:30.300 --> 02:00:31.880]  well, probably by most people's standards,
[02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:33.780]  I watch very little YouTube,
[02:00:33.780 --> 02:00:36.740]  but I think I watch a fair amount of YouTube.
[02:00:36.740 --> 02:00:38.300]  I never even look at the comments.
[02:00:38.300 --> 02:00:39.980]  I mean, the only time I ever think about it
[02:00:39.980 --> 02:00:44.140]  is at the end of all these videos from serious YouTubers
[02:00:44.140 --> 02:00:46.700]  where they always say, if you like this video,
[02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:48.980]  hit the thumbs up button or whatever
[02:00:48.980 --> 02:00:51.820]  and subscribe and leave a comment or whatever.
[02:00:51.820 --> 02:00:54.020]  I hear them talking about it at the end of the video
[02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:57.080]  as I'm about to close the tab, but I never actually look.
[02:00:58.780 --> 02:01:01.060]  But when I do, when it occurs to me to look,
[02:01:01.060 --> 02:01:03.860]  I'm often blown away by how many comments there are.
[02:01:03.860 --> 02:01:07.340]  Like there are, holy crap, there's a lot of comments,
[02:01:07.340 --> 02:01:09.460]  you know, like, and you look at somebody's video
[02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:14.460]  and it's, you know, supposedly has 800,000 views
[02:01:14.620 --> 02:01:16.300]  and you're like, hmm, that's a lot of views.
[02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:18.020]  And then you're like, but then you look at the comments
[02:01:18.020 --> 02:01:19.300]  and you see how many there are,
[02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:20.980]  it's like 1200 comments or something.
[02:01:20.980 --> 02:01:23.380]  And you're like, well, maybe there are 800,000 views
[02:01:23.380 --> 02:01:25.660]  if 1200 people commented on it.
[02:01:25.660 --> 02:01:27.500]  The scale of YouTube is like,
[02:01:27.500 --> 02:01:28.980]  when I started getting into it
[02:01:28.980 --> 02:01:31.100]  and then you look at someone like Shane Dawson
[02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:32.460]  who's been making videos for a while,
[02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:35.540]  but now we'll put up 145 minute conspiracy theory video
[02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:38.380]  and it gets 20 to 40 million views
[02:01:38.380 --> 02:01:41.380]  or Desposito I think just hit 6 billion views.
[02:01:41.380 --> 02:01:44.000]  It just dwarfs, I think, anything else that's been built
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.780]  on like a content platform on the internet.
[02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:49.020]  Yeah, at a technical level, it is amazing.
[02:01:49.020 --> 02:01:52.220]  And it's kind of interesting, you know,
[02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:54.860]  in a historical idea, you know, that,
[02:01:54.860 --> 02:01:56.580]  I forget what Google paid for YouTube,
[02:01:56.580 --> 02:02:00.540]  but it's one of those, I think it was like a billion dollars,
[02:02:00.540 --> 02:02:04.580]  whatever it was, it's like up there with Facegram,
[02:02:04.580 --> 02:02:06.640]  Facebook buying Instagram.
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:07.980]  I just called them Facegram.
[02:02:07.980 --> 02:02:10.860]  That would be a good way to rebrand.
[02:02:10.860 --> 02:02:13.260]  Facebook buying Instagram for a billion dollars
[02:02:13.260 --> 02:02:16.320]  or, you know, you would have to, you know,
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:19.820]  the next reunification with Apple for a couple hundred
[02:02:19.820 --> 02:02:22.660]  million dollars has obviously turned out to be a great deal.
[02:02:22.660 --> 02:02:25.740]  You'd have to, but like what would have happened to YouTube?
[02:02:25.740 --> 02:02:28.680]  It's hard to imagine a future where,
[02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:31.480]  a world where YouTube isn't part of Google, right?
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:33.380]  Like who else could have bought them
[02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:37.020]  and scaled them to be where they are?
[02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:38.400]  Yeah, I mean, there's a possibility
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:39.820]  they could have become their own Google,
[02:02:39.820 --> 02:02:41.860]  that just their growth would have been so well managed
[02:02:41.860 --> 02:02:42.820]  that they would have become a company
[02:02:42.820 --> 02:02:44.540]  like a Google or a Facebook.
[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:46.660]  And that's always like, you know, Snap never sold
[02:02:46.660 --> 02:02:48.380]  because they want it to be the next Google
[02:02:48.380 --> 02:02:51.980]  and who knows if that'll maybe not work out for them now.
[02:02:51.980 --> 02:02:53.740]  That's sort of the two choices you have.
[02:02:53.740 --> 02:02:55.300]  Like, you know, like Google never sold.
[02:02:55.300 --> 02:02:56.740]  They were offered many times.
[02:02:56.740 --> 02:02:58.380]  They never sold either.
[02:02:58.380 --> 02:03:01.400]  Yeah, I think that that's the most likely alternate universe
[02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:03.900]  is one where YouTube stuck independent
[02:03:03.900 --> 02:03:07.160]  and became one of the big six, you know, companies.
[02:03:08.220 --> 02:03:11.460]  Cause I just can't imagine who else could have done this
[02:03:11.460 --> 02:03:13.800]  or would have tolerated it, right?
[02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:18.800]  Like you have to have a certain mindset to have a,
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:21.980]  we'll let people post whatever video they want.
[02:03:21.980 --> 02:03:22.820]  Yeah.
[02:03:24.500 --> 02:03:26.980]  I mean, it's kind of crazy.
[02:03:26.980 --> 02:03:28.220]  Yeah, no, it really is.
[02:03:28.220 --> 02:03:29.760]  And it, again, like just like Facebook,
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:32.400]  it's like an impossible problem.
[02:03:33.660 --> 02:03:34.500]  It really is.
[02:03:34.500 --> 02:03:39.500]  And it's, you know, again, it's trade-offs, you know,
[02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:43.620]  there were a lot of problems with the world of print
[02:03:43.620 --> 02:03:47.300]  and, you know, mass media prior to the internet
[02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:52.020]  where a lot of voices were locked out of the conversation.
[02:03:52.020 --> 02:03:55.100]  And part of the reason why our society
[02:03:55.100 --> 02:03:58.220]  was so much less tolerant than it is now,
[02:03:58.220 --> 02:03:59.640]  not that we've, you know,
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:01.820]  gotten rid of our problems with intolerance
[02:04:03.020 --> 02:04:06.540]  as evidenced by many of today's headlines.
[02:04:08.220 --> 02:04:10.720]  But the world is certainly in arguably a more tolerant place
[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:12.020]  than it used to be in the internet
[02:04:12.020 --> 02:04:16.820]  and the providing voices and the allowing of publications
[02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:19.680]  that, you know, with other perspectives,
[02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:24.020]  certainly is a great thing, but it's trade-offs
[02:04:24.020 --> 02:04:25.960]  because it's also allowed people
[02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:28.260]  who never would have gotten more of a crowd
[02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:32.100]  than what they could assemble raving at a street corner
[02:04:32.100 --> 02:04:37.100]  with a megaphone to have a very large audience.
[02:04:37.140 --> 02:04:39.900]  Well, I mean, like the problem with YouTube and Facebook,
[02:04:39.900 --> 02:04:41.120]  their strength is their weakness.
[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:44.080]  So they are incredible recommendation engines.
[02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:48.860]  So for example, like if I listen to your post WWDC podcast,
[02:04:48.860 --> 02:04:52.380]  there's no sidebar that recommends Snell's post WWDC podcast,
[02:04:52.380 --> 02:04:53.980]  you know, the connected guys.
[02:04:53.980 --> 02:04:54.820]  There's just no way for me
[02:04:54.820 --> 02:04:56.140]  to listen to more of the same thing.
[02:04:56.140 --> 02:04:57.500]  I can listen to more of your stuff,
[02:04:57.500 --> 02:04:58.420]  but not other people's take.
[02:04:58.420 --> 02:05:00.700]  Same thing if I read an article on Daring Fireball,
[02:05:00.700 --> 02:05:01.760]  I don't also get, you know,
[02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:04.320]  Dalrymple's take and Marco's take.
[02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:06.460]  But with YouTube videos and with Facebook,
[02:05:06.460 --> 02:05:08.380]  they see what you want and they give you more of it.
[02:05:08.380 --> 02:05:09.860]  And that amplifies content.
[02:05:09.860 --> 02:05:11.300]  Like you can get unbelievable.
[02:05:11.300 --> 02:05:12.820]  Suddenly you could look up in your content,
[02:05:12.820 --> 02:05:15.220]  it's got a million, two million views out of nowhere,
[02:05:15.220 --> 02:05:18.060]  but also you're being shown conspiracy theory videos
[02:05:18.060 --> 02:05:21.220]  and real, real dumb stuff right along with it.
[02:05:21.220 --> 02:05:22.980]  So it amplifies both the good and the bad
[02:05:22.980 --> 02:05:24.620]  to an unbelievable degree.
[02:05:24.620 --> 02:05:28.800]  Yeah, I completely agree.
[02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:33.660]  Well, lightning round, a few other things before we wrap up.
[02:05:33.660 --> 02:05:35.140]  There was this weird bug.
[02:05:35.140 --> 02:05:36.260]  Well, maybe it's a bug.
[02:05:36.260 --> 02:05:38.920]  I don't know what the hell this story is
[02:05:38.920 --> 02:05:43.540]  where Google's home speakers at some point in the last week
[02:05:43.540 --> 02:05:45.980]  started showing a thing for Apple Music
[02:05:47.060 --> 02:05:50.060]  and everybody thought it was like,
[02:05:50.060 --> 02:05:52.740]  oh, they prematurely launched this before it was ready.
[02:05:52.740 --> 02:05:56.060]  Cause you know, I mean, it's nowhere near,
[02:05:56.060 --> 02:05:58.740]  it wouldn't be as surprising as the initial news
[02:05:58.740 --> 02:06:02.820]  that Apple Music is available on Amazon's Echo ones,
[02:06:02.820 --> 02:06:04.680]  you know, from earlier this year was.
[02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:05.780]  But now that that's out,
[02:06:05.780 --> 02:06:07.540]  well, if they're gonna do it on Echo,
[02:06:07.540 --> 02:06:09.060]  if they could work out the terms with Google,
[02:06:09.060 --> 02:06:11.820]  presumably they would and will do it on Google too.
[02:06:11.820 --> 02:06:14.260]  But now they're saying it was just a bug,
[02:06:14.260 --> 02:06:16.920]  but it's a very strange bug.
[02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:17.760]  Yeah, I mean, it works.
[02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:19.780]  It was been available for Android since launch.
[02:06:19.780 --> 02:06:20.620]  It doesn't surprise me.
[02:06:20.620 --> 02:06:22.060]  Apple's whole thing is that they want people
[02:06:22.060 --> 02:06:23.260]  who have family subscriptions
[02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:24.380]  to be able to listen to it everywhere
[02:06:24.380 --> 02:06:26.100]  because it makes it more valuable.
[02:06:26.100 --> 02:06:28.300]  And they realize that there's a whole bunch of diversity
[02:06:28.300 --> 02:06:30.340]  in people's homes and ecosystems.
[02:06:30.340 --> 02:06:31.820]  So I wouldn't be surprised if it comes out.
[02:06:31.820 --> 02:06:35.620]  I don't tend to take Google statements on face value anyway.
[02:06:35.620 --> 02:06:40.620]  But then it, you know, and I don't blame Apple for it.
[02:06:41.020 --> 02:06:42.900]  You know, I think it kind of makes sense
[02:06:42.900 --> 02:06:46.780]  with the services push, you know, and I don't think,
[02:06:46.780 --> 02:06:49.900]  I do think, I think the HomePod is in many ways
[02:06:49.900 --> 02:06:53.700]  a misunderstood product because it isn't meant
[02:06:53.700 --> 02:06:58.700]  to compete with $70 Echo and Google dots
[02:06:58.820 --> 02:07:00.260]  or whatever they call theirs.
[02:07:01.420 --> 02:07:04.140]  It really is, you know, the best way to understand it
[02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:06.120]  is to listen to the way Apple describes it.
[02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:09.680]  And it really is supposed to be a nice $350 speaker system.
[02:07:09.680 --> 02:07:12.620]  And the fact that it uses Siri as the interface
[02:07:12.620 --> 02:07:15.340]  is an implementation detail.
[02:07:15.340 --> 02:07:17.020]  I mean, yes, you can use it for stuff.
[02:07:17.020 --> 02:07:19.740]  I use it to turn off lights and raise the shades
[02:07:19.740 --> 02:07:21.020]  and lower the shades.
[02:07:21.020 --> 02:07:26.020]  I do use it that way, but Apple knew at $350
[02:07:27.100 --> 02:07:30.460]  that it was, even in the best case scenario,
[02:07:30.460 --> 02:07:35.460]  not going to outsell $50 little hockey puck things.
[02:07:36.940 --> 02:07:37.780]  They don't have one.
[02:07:37.780 --> 02:07:38.700]  They've used this before, they're very candid.
[02:07:38.700 --> 02:07:41.100]  They, it really was meant to be, you have an empty room,
[02:07:41.100 --> 02:07:43.420]  you wanna put, you wanna drop one thing in
[02:07:43.420 --> 02:07:45.620]  that you can put almost anywhere and will sound great
[02:07:45.620 --> 02:07:47.460]  and almost anywhere that you're in the room.
[02:07:47.460 --> 02:07:48.900]  And that's the problem it solves.
[02:07:48.900 --> 02:07:50.500]  And Siri is just the only way you control it
[02:07:50.500 --> 02:07:51.660]  because it's a speaker.
[02:07:51.660 --> 02:07:53.320]  Yeah, I can't help but think though,
[02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:56.340]  that this bug wasn't really that like somebody,
[02:07:56.340 --> 02:08:01.260]  some rogue individual at Google somehow put
[02:08:01.260 --> 02:08:04.580]  the Apple Music icon in there and just mocked it up.
[02:08:04.580 --> 02:08:07.420]  Like, here's what it would look like if we had Apple Music
[02:08:07.420 --> 02:08:08.860]  and then accidentally shipped it.
[02:08:08.860 --> 02:08:12.740]  Presumably, they're either, it is either a done deal
[02:08:12.740 --> 02:08:15.980]  and is coming and unannounced or they're in the midst of it
[02:08:15.980 --> 02:08:17.780]  far enough along that they're working on it
[02:08:17.780 --> 02:08:21.820]  and it was a mistake that it showed, you know.
[02:08:21.820 --> 02:08:23.100]  That's what it feels like.
[02:08:23.100 --> 02:08:26.140]  Yeah, and you know, again, it makes sense
[02:08:26.140 --> 02:08:30.100]  that they want Apple Music everywhere you listen to music.
[02:08:31.420 --> 02:08:33.180]  They're writing iTunes for Tizen, John.
[02:08:33.180 --> 02:08:35.300]  This is their service story.
[02:08:35.300 --> 02:08:39.660]  So that brings me to the upcoming rumored event
[02:08:39.660 --> 02:08:43.540]  a month from now, supposedly this leaked in advance.
[02:08:43.540 --> 02:08:48.220]  And of course, media partners are the leakiest companies.
[02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:51.960]  Like, how in the world did Apple's supposed Monday,
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:54.660]  March 25th event at the Steve Jobs Theater,
[02:08:54.660 --> 02:08:56.900]  how did it leak so far in advance?
[02:08:56.900 --> 02:09:00.180]  Well, because they're talking, if it's true,
[02:09:00.180 --> 02:09:04.500]  they are talking to magazines and newspapers
[02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:06.460]  about a subscription Apple News service
[02:09:06.460 --> 02:09:11.220]  and they're talking to various TV movie type companies
[02:09:11.220 --> 02:09:14.660]  about, I guess, about, you know,
[02:09:14.660 --> 02:09:19.180]  some kind of subscription TV service, video service.
[02:09:19.180 --> 02:09:21.100]  Including which celebrities would be on stage,
[02:09:21.100 --> 02:09:23.500]  you know, that's the secret that's not gonna stay.
[02:09:23.500 --> 02:09:28.500]  Right, I'm interested in what you think about it.
[02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:33.140]  And I'm guessing that if this is true,
[02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:35.820]  that this would be an event where
[02:09:35.820 --> 02:09:37.780]  if there are any products to announce,
[02:09:37.780 --> 02:09:40.540]  it might be there's a lot of smoke,
[02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:42.300]  the enough smoke that there's probably a fire
[02:09:42.300 --> 02:09:46.580]  to the fact that there's going to be some kind of refresh
[02:09:46.580 --> 02:09:51.580]  to the AirPods lineup with the case that charges.
[02:09:51.580 --> 02:09:53.340]  I'm just going to say wirelessly,
[02:09:53.340 --> 02:09:57.580]  but I really inductively because it's not really wireless
[02:09:57.580 --> 02:09:58.940]  if it doesn't go over the air,
[02:09:58.940 --> 02:10:01.820]  but the wireless charging case also,
[02:10:01.820 --> 02:10:05.820]  the AirPods might come in black,
[02:10:05.820 --> 02:10:09.340]  which is interesting and I think would prove very popular,
[02:10:09.340 --> 02:10:11.980]  but it's kind of interesting because they went with the,
[02:10:11.980 --> 02:10:14.860]  we've got one set of earbuds and they're white
[02:10:14.860 --> 02:10:16.780]  and you're gonna like it for a long time
[02:10:16.780 --> 02:10:17.980]  while they were wired.
[02:10:17.980 --> 02:10:19.820]  And you have to be very careful
[02:10:19.820 --> 02:10:23.420]  how they were wired and used that
[02:10:23.420 --> 02:10:28.420]  for a very successful ad campaign.
[02:10:28.580 --> 02:10:30.020]  They were iconic.
[02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:32.460]  Right, like what the ads made them,
[02:10:32.460 --> 02:10:35.460]  emphasize the iconic nature of Apple's white earbuds.
[02:10:35.460 --> 02:10:40.180]  You remember those very, very colorful ads
[02:10:40.180 --> 02:10:44.020]  where the very colorful, vibrant colors of people dancing,
[02:10:44.020 --> 02:10:46.700]  listening to music with these white earbuds
[02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:47.900]  and wires coming out
[02:10:47.900 --> 02:10:50.220]  and they didn't even need to show the iPod, right?
[02:10:50.220 --> 02:10:52.180]  And if anyone was wearing white earbuds,
[02:10:52.180 --> 02:10:53.220]  it didn't matter if they were Apple and not,
[02:10:53.220 --> 02:10:55.220]  you just assumed that they were listening to an iPod.
[02:10:55.220 --> 02:10:59.660]  Right, and so, famously today,
[02:10:59.660 --> 02:11:02.620]  the AirPods are very, very popular product.
[02:11:02.620 --> 02:11:06.500]  They're subject of memes where people think you're rich
[02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:09.060]  if you have AirPods, but they're so popular now
[02:11:09.060 --> 02:11:11.500]  and they're very, again, iconic
[02:11:11.500 --> 02:11:14.340]  and for however much guff that people gave them
[02:11:14.340 --> 02:11:16.220]  and thought that they looked goofy when they came out,
[02:11:16.220 --> 02:11:17.300]  which I never understood.
[02:11:17.300 --> 02:11:18.540]  I believe I wrote about this on Daring Fireball.
[02:11:18.540 --> 02:11:21.100]  I don't understand why people thought AirPods looked weird
[02:11:21.100 --> 02:11:23.940]  because they looked exactly like Apple's wireless,
[02:11:23.940 --> 02:11:27.260]  wired ear pods without the wires.
[02:11:27.260 --> 02:11:29.860]  It is, I understand why people felt a little
[02:11:32.940 --> 02:11:34.500]  self-conscious, I did.
[02:11:34.500 --> 02:11:37.340]  I felt self-conscious when I first started wearing AirPods.
[02:11:38.540 --> 02:11:40.220]  Like those big old Bluetooth headsets, right?
[02:11:40.220 --> 02:11:43.260]  Well, but not because I thought I looked goofy,
[02:11:43.260 --> 02:11:45.460]  but because this is so weird, right?
[02:11:45.460 --> 02:11:48.900]  After years and years of wearing wired ear pods,
[02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:51.340]  it felt so weird to put them in
[02:11:51.340 --> 02:11:53.660]  and not have anything holding them in place.
[02:11:53.660 --> 02:11:57.140]  Like it's, you know, you'd like to think
[02:11:57.140 --> 02:11:59.180]  that they designed them not to fall out of your ears,
[02:11:59.180 --> 02:12:01.620]  but it sure looks like they would fall out of your ears.
[02:12:01.620 --> 02:12:04.100]  It turns out for most people with most ears,
[02:12:04.100 --> 02:12:05.780]  they don't, which is amazing,
[02:12:06.740 --> 02:12:08.460]  but that's what made me conscious.
[02:12:08.460 --> 02:12:09.700]  Now, maybe not self-conscious,
[02:12:09.700 --> 02:12:12.420]  but it just seemed to me like when I first had AirPods,
[02:12:12.420 --> 02:12:15.260]  I felt, I never, I was thinking about them all the time
[02:12:15.260 --> 02:12:16.820]  because I'm like, don't fall out, don't fall out,
[02:12:16.820 --> 02:12:18.220]  don't fall out.
[02:12:18.220 --> 02:12:20.060]  And then eventually, you know, you get used to it
[02:12:20.060 --> 02:12:21.220]  and they become the new normal.
[02:12:21.220 --> 02:12:23.620]  But anyway, switching to black or offering black,
[02:12:23.620 --> 02:12:24.620]  I guess they're not going to switch,
[02:12:24.620 --> 02:12:26.060]  but offering black as an option
[02:12:26.060 --> 02:12:28.060]  takes away a little bit of that iconic nature.
[02:12:28.060 --> 02:12:29.060]  Yeah.
[02:12:29.060 --> 02:12:29.980]  Yeah.
[02:12:29.980 --> 02:12:31.340]  I mean, we are in the age of fashion,
[02:12:31.340 --> 02:12:32.260]  especially with wearables.
[02:12:32.260 --> 02:12:33.540]  We saw that with the watch,
[02:12:33.540 --> 02:12:35.980]  where different casings and different bands.
[02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:38.220]  My only, like, because when John Pachowski,
[02:12:38.220 --> 02:12:39.700]  Mr. O'Fann and John Pachowski
[02:12:39.700 --> 02:12:41.860]  broke the rumor about the event,
[02:12:41.860 --> 02:12:43.460]  he said very specifically that he heard
[02:12:43.460 --> 02:12:44.900]  there were not going to be AirPods
[02:12:44.900 --> 02:12:46.540]  and there was not going to be an iPad mini.
[02:12:46.540 --> 02:12:50.060]  He didn't say there was not going to be the iPad 10.2 inch
[02:12:50.060 --> 02:12:51.500]  refresh for the lower end one,
[02:12:51.500 --> 02:12:53.820]  but it's odd that they would have one,
[02:12:53.820 --> 02:12:55.260]  but not the, like, it seems to me
[02:12:55.260 --> 02:12:56.900]  that if you're going to show off news,
[02:12:56.900 --> 02:12:59.580]  it'd be great to show it off on a new iPad.
[02:12:59.580 --> 02:13:00.740]  It just seems like a good fit.
[02:13:00.740 --> 02:13:02.180]  And if you're going to show off television,
[02:13:02.180 --> 02:13:05.580]  it'd be good to show that off on new products as well.
[02:13:05.580 --> 02:13:07.700]  And like the daily was the only event I could think of
[02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:08.740]  where Apple actually showed,
[02:13:08.740 --> 02:13:12.300]  and that was a very small, very specific event,
[02:13:12.300 --> 02:13:15.300]  but just a services event would be something very different.
[02:13:15.300 --> 02:13:16.900]  And they have so much
[02:13:16.900 --> 02:13:19.200]  expectational debt around any Apple event.
[02:13:19.200 --> 02:13:22.300]  We're used to, like March is where we saw the first Mac book
[02:13:22.300 --> 02:13:24.620]  where they had the launch for the Apple watch,
[02:13:24.620 --> 02:13:28.360]  the launch for the iPhone SE, the 9.7 inch iPad.
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:29.940]  There's just so many iconic products
[02:13:29.940 --> 02:13:31.500]  that have come out in March.
[02:13:31.500 --> 02:13:35.900]  Nevermind going back a few years to like the iPad itself,
[02:13:35.900 --> 02:13:37.580]  that I think people will just assume
[02:13:37.580 --> 02:13:39.300]  there's going to be a lot of that stuff there.
[02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:40.380]  And it'll be hard for them
[02:13:40.380 --> 02:13:42.740]  to just not do hardware at the show.
[02:13:44.220 --> 02:13:47.220]  Yeah, but what that hardware will be, I don't know.
[02:13:47.220 --> 02:13:51.220]  I think, you know, a new regular iPad would be interesting
[02:13:51.220 --> 02:13:52.420]  and it would be, you know,
[02:13:52.420 --> 02:13:54.840]  cause last year's was about a year ago.
[02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:59.840]  So that's interesting to think that the entry model iPad
[02:14:00.060 --> 02:14:01.980]  is on an annual refresh rate
[02:14:01.980 --> 02:14:04.540]  that they're not letting that sit.
[02:14:04.540 --> 02:14:06.960]  Oh, that's just the $350 one.
[02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:08.000]  We don't, you know,
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.120]  our heart and soul is only in the iPad Pros,
[02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:12.740]  the expensive ones with the latest and greatest technology.
[02:14:12.740 --> 02:14:14.180]  It'd be interesting if, you know,
[02:14:14.180 --> 02:14:15.020]  and who knows, you know.
[02:14:15.020 --> 02:14:16.540]  And it's time for education.
[02:14:16.540 --> 02:14:18.900]  I mean, this is when you want to sell the education iPad.
[02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:22.100]  Right, AirPods would be interesting.
[02:14:22.100 --> 02:14:24.900]  Presumably, I can't help but think that
[02:14:24.900 --> 02:14:26.860]  if they are going to unveil AirPods,
[02:14:26.860 --> 02:14:29.700]  which have a wireless charging case,
[02:14:29.700 --> 02:14:33.820]  that they would also finally have,
[02:14:33.820 --> 02:14:36.700]  dare I say it, the AirPower.
[02:14:36.700 --> 02:14:40.620]  Yeah, the new and functional AirPower.
[02:14:40.620 --> 02:14:41.740]  I can't help it.
[02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:45.300]  You know, I just don't see how they talk about wireless,
[02:14:45.300 --> 02:14:47.940]  even if they charge on a standard Qi charger,
[02:14:47.940 --> 02:14:50.940]  which I'm not sure that the AirPods case will.
[02:14:50.940 --> 02:14:52.920]  Like if it charges wirelessly,
[02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:56.100]  it might charge wirelessly only with the AirPower.
[02:14:56.100 --> 02:14:57.980]  I don't think we have an answer to that.
[02:14:57.980 --> 02:15:00.300]  Well, the rumor is that this year's iPhone
[02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:02.340]  is going to do bilateral inductive charging,
[02:15:02.340 --> 02:15:03.820]  which is what the Samsung phone,
[02:15:03.820 --> 02:15:05.880]  and I forget, I think the Huawei already do that,
[02:15:05.880 --> 02:15:07.940]  where you turn them upside down, and it's terrible.
[02:15:07.940 --> 02:15:08.900]  It's terrible for phones.
[02:15:08.900 --> 02:15:11.700]  It's like 1% after 15 minutes, it shuts off.
[02:15:11.700 --> 02:15:13.860]  But like with the Galaxy Buds,
[02:15:13.860 --> 02:15:16.180]  they've shown this with something small like AirPods,
[02:15:16.180 --> 02:15:17.380]  just putting them in the back of your phone,
[02:15:17.380 --> 02:15:19.300]  it's a realistic charging mechanism.
[02:15:19.300 --> 02:15:21.580]  And that means it would have to be very similar
[02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:24.640]  to what Apple, to what Qi is already doing on the iPhone.
[02:15:24.640 --> 02:15:25.980]  Well, who knows, but I, you know,
[02:15:25.980 --> 02:15:30.200]  that might be a product that ships in this March event.
[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:31.260]  That would be-
[02:15:31.260 --> 02:15:33.320]  New watch bands, could get those every March.
[02:15:33.320 --> 02:15:34.700]  Right, right, right.
[02:15:34.700 --> 02:15:38.100]  And I don't want to wait till June on my presumption
[02:15:38.100 --> 02:15:41.500]  that if there's a March 25th Apple event,
[02:15:41.500 --> 02:15:42.940]  the next time we hear from Apple
[02:15:42.940 --> 02:15:45.860]  will be the WWDC keynote in early June.
[02:15:46.740 --> 02:15:49.940]  Yeah, so I would guess the spring assortment
[02:15:49.940 --> 02:15:53.220]  of watch straps will be, would be unveiled at this event.
[02:15:53.220 --> 02:15:54.060]  I don't know if it would get staged time or not.
[02:15:54.060 --> 02:15:55.140]  Or like a press release too.
[02:15:55.140 --> 02:15:56.140]  I mean, yeah, that's right.
[02:15:56.140 --> 02:15:57.400]  Because sometimes they're just a press release,
[02:15:57.400 --> 02:15:59.620]  or you see them on apple.com around the same time.
[02:15:59.620 --> 02:16:00.980]  Right.
[02:16:00.980 --> 02:16:02.620]  I hope they bring back the nylon straps.
[02:16:02.620 --> 02:16:04.220]  Have I said this to you before?
[02:16:04.220 --> 02:16:05.700]  God, I'm on my mind right now.
[02:16:05.700 --> 02:16:07.300]  I still can't believe that they let,
[02:16:07.300 --> 02:16:08.940]  that they, that they're all gone.
[02:16:08.940 --> 02:16:09.780]  Only thing I keep-
[02:16:09.780 --> 02:16:10.600]  Yeah, it's really odd.
[02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:11.440]  Somebody just wrote to me,
[02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:13.380]  some reader just wrote to me and was like,
[02:16:14.820 --> 02:16:18.820]  just professing their love for the nylon watch straps
[02:16:18.820 --> 02:16:21.660]  and asking me if I had any insight into where they went.
[02:16:21.660 --> 02:16:22.660]  And I said, no, none.
[02:16:22.660 --> 02:16:24.020]  And they're my favorite too.
[02:16:26.100 --> 02:16:27.300]  And I can only presume
[02:16:27.300 --> 02:16:29.060]  that they just weren't selling that well,
[02:16:29.060 --> 02:16:31.020]  because if they were selling great,
[02:16:31.020 --> 02:16:33.580]  why in the world would they have taken them off the market?
[02:16:33.580 --> 02:16:35.340]  Unless, I mean, everyone seems to,
[02:16:35.340 --> 02:16:37.900]  like just so many people just wear the sport band
[02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:40.020]  and the sport loop are incredibly popular.
[02:16:40.020 --> 02:16:42.260]  So it could just be that there was no room in between them.
[02:16:42.260 --> 02:16:43.100]  Yeah, maybe.
[02:16:43.100 --> 02:16:43.940]  Anymore.
[02:16:43.940 --> 02:16:46.500]  But I don't like the sport loop for multiple reasons.
[02:16:46.500 --> 02:16:49.780]  I don't like the double, the doubling on the one side
[02:16:49.780 --> 02:16:52.300]  and I'm just not really a Velcro person.
[02:16:52.300 --> 02:16:53.740]  But people wear them like sweatpants.
[02:16:53.740 --> 02:16:55.520]  They're like, I like the sweatpants from watch pants.
[02:16:55.520 --> 02:16:56.580]  No, and I know, I, you know,
[02:16:56.580 --> 02:16:58.420]  but I think that's part of even,
[02:16:58.420 --> 02:17:01.740]  without even touching the world of third party
[02:17:01.740 --> 02:17:04.260]  Apple watch straps, which is huge, you know,
[02:17:04.260 --> 02:17:07.140]  just within staying within the Apple branded ones.
[02:17:07.140 --> 02:17:10.520]  I really do think it's fundamental
[02:17:10.520 --> 02:17:12.100]  to the success of the platform
[02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:17.100]  that you've got this variety of looks and feels, you know,
[02:17:17.980 --> 02:17:21.180]  it's such an intimate, a watch is such an intimate thing.
[02:17:21.180 --> 02:17:25.300]  And cause it really is touching your skin all the time.
[02:17:25.300 --> 02:17:28.460]  Having a strap that you think both feels good,
[02:17:28.460 --> 02:17:31.860]  fits right and looks cool is super, super important.
[02:17:31.860 --> 02:17:34.340]  And having a variety is the only way to do that.
[02:17:34.340 --> 02:17:38.780]  But my favorite is the nylon strap.
[02:17:38.780 --> 02:17:40.080]  Yeah.
[02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:41.940]  Yeah, no, I wish it comes back to you.
[02:17:41.940 --> 02:17:43.660]  Yeah, I don't know, but I guess that's coming.
[02:17:43.660 --> 02:17:44.500]  Anything else?
[02:17:44.500 --> 02:17:46.500]  I don't expect any Mac hardware.
[02:17:47.860 --> 02:17:49.900]  It feels like iMac spec bumps
[02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:52.740]  should be in another press release at some point.
[02:17:52.740 --> 02:17:53.580]  Yeah.
[02:17:53.580 --> 02:17:54.400]  If not to do anything radical,
[02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:56.740]  they should just drop the coffee lake.
[02:17:56.740 --> 02:17:58.800]  And I forget what the Xeon is on now.
[02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:00.060]  But I don't really think,
[02:18:00.060 --> 02:18:02.480]  I don't see how they can do anything with the display.
[02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:04.740]  They're already at 5K.
[02:18:04.740 --> 02:18:07.700]  They already have the high dynamic range,
[02:18:07.700 --> 02:18:08.740]  whatever you call it.
[02:18:09.740 --> 02:18:11.200]  Yeah, the DCI-P3.
[02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:14.240]  Right, they already have that, you know, so it's,
[02:18:15.460 --> 02:18:17.400]  if they're not gonna change the size,
[02:18:17.400 --> 02:18:21.100]  I don't know what else there is, you know, it's truly,
[02:18:21.100 --> 02:18:23.300]  you know, what I expect the next iMacs to be
[02:18:23.300 --> 02:18:25.660]  is a true speed bump where they're just,
[02:18:25.660 --> 02:18:27.780]  they look exactly the same, but they're faster.
[02:18:27.780 --> 02:18:29.540]  I mean, eventually we all want that redesign
[02:18:29.540 --> 02:18:30.940]  where it's similar to what they're rumoring
[02:18:30.940 --> 02:18:35.220]  for the pro display, where it's like a 6K mini LED panel
[02:18:35.220 --> 02:18:36.900]  with face ID buried in it.
[02:18:36.900 --> 02:18:37.740]  Right.
[02:18:37.740 --> 02:18:39.900]  And then everyone will refresh at that point,
[02:18:39.900 --> 02:18:41.460]  but it doesn't sound like it's ready yet.
[02:18:41.460 --> 02:18:43.740]  Right, yeah, and I think,
[02:18:43.740 --> 02:18:46.620]  I'm guessing that they'll do the standalone display first,
[02:18:46.620 --> 02:18:50.300]  but, and I, you know, I don't think the Mac Pro is coming
[02:18:50.300 --> 02:18:52.020]  at a March media event,
[02:18:52.020 --> 02:18:55.660]  and even putting aside the German rumor from last week
[02:18:55.660 --> 02:18:59.740]  that it might be coming at WWDC, which I think is crazy,
[02:18:59.740 --> 02:19:01.320]  because I think if it doesn't come at WWDC,
[02:19:01.320 --> 02:19:02.340]  we've got to start questioning
[02:19:02.340 --> 02:19:04.300]  what the hell's going on with that.
[02:19:04.300 --> 02:19:06.940]  If I was Apple, like just given some of the delays,
[02:19:06.940 --> 02:19:09.920]  I would be, like I know a lot of you would love them
[02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:11.700]  just to show it off and say it's coming in December
[02:19:11.700 --> 02:19:14.740]  like they did with the iMac Pro two years ago,
[02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:17.820]  but just with the delays, I think they should be conservative
[02:19:17.820 --> 02:19:19.980]  in what they tease for the next little while.
[02:19:19.980 --> 02:19:22.940]  Well, yeah, but it's, I mean,
[02:19:22.940 --> 02:19:25.540]  I guess if they're not going to show it at WWDC,
[02:19:25.540 --> 02:19:27.380]  they'll just leak, they have to,
[02:19:27.380 --> 02:19:29.460]  if they're not going to show it at WWDC,
[02:19:29.460 --> 02:19:32.540]  that would be something they would have to leak to somebody
[02:19:32.540 --> 02:19:36.900]  and get the word out, because if there's no word at all
[02:19:36.900 --> 02:19:39.260]  about the Mac Pro before the keynote,
[02:19:39.260 --> 02:19:42.100]  there's gonna be thousands and thousands of developers
[02:19:42.100 --> 02:19:46.500]  who are watching this, watching the WWDC keynote with,
[02:19:46.500 --> 02:19:48.060]  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shut up about that.
[02:19:48.060 --> 02:19:49.300]  Give me the Mac Pro, give me the Mac Pro,
[02:19:49.300 --> 02:19:51.440]  give me the Mac Pro, and then it's like Tim Cook says,
[02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:54.220]  thanks, have a great week.
[02:19:54.220 --> 02:19:58.020]  At WWDC, people are gonna be, what?
[02:19:58.020 --> 02:19:59.100]  Well, I mean, there's so many problems
[02:19:59.100 --> 02:20:00.220]  with the expectations here too,
[02:20:00.220 --> 02:20:01.900]  because when Apple said modular,
[02:20:01.900 --> 02:20:03.940]  everyone in their own mind interpreted that differently.
[02:20:03.940 --> 02:20:06.260]  Some people thinking it's a new cheese grater,
[02:20:06.260 --> 02:20:07.420]  some people thinking that it's something
[02:20:07.420 --> 02:20:09.260]  you can just plug cards into.
[02:20:09.260 --> 02:20:11.220]  It was a rumor, and I'm blanking on where it was,
[02:20:11.220 --> 02:20:13.500]  where it's gonna be almost like a red camera
[02:20:13.500 --> 02:20:15.900]  where you'll have a brain module, like a Mac Mini,
[02:20:15.900 --> 02:20:18.100]  and you'll be able to stack other Lego bricks on it,
[02:20:18.100 --> 02:20:20.180]  and those are all fundamentally different products.
[02:20:20.180 --> 02:20:24.660]  Right, it doesn't, yeah, it's one of those words
[02:20:24.660 --> 02:20:26.220]  that everybody, yeah, you're right,
[02:20:26.220 --> 02:20:27.540]  everybody takes the word modular,
[02:20:27.540 --> 02:20:30.940]  and they think modular in the way I want it to be modular.
[02:20:30.940 --> 02:20:31.780]  Yes.
[02:20:33.820 --> 02:20:35.380]  Well, and I was saying to this,
[02:20:35.380 --> 02:20:38.180]  I think it was with Glenn on the last episode,
[02:20:38.180 --> 02:20:43.180]  where there's an awful lot of people who when,
[02:20:43.180 --> 02:20:48.180]  when a year ago, Pansarino got the,
[02:20:48.220 --> 02:20:52.020]  here's our update on Mac Pro, it's not a 2018 thing,
[02:20:53.060 --> 02:20:56.340]  but we, and gave him the interesting look
[02:20:56.340 --> 02:21:00.700]  at the pro musicians and video editors
[02:21:00.700 --> 02:21:04.100]  that Apple's hired full-time to work hand in hand
[02:21:04.100 --> 02:21:08.020]  with the teams making their pro editing software
[02:21:08.020 --> 02:21:13.020]  for Final Cut Pro 10 and Logic.
[02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:16.820]  Really, really interesting story of the pros,
[02:21:16.820 --> 02:21:19.700]  actual pros working hand in hand with the development team
[02:21:19.700 --> 02:21:22.260]  and presumably also helping to inform
[02:21:22.260 --> 02:21:24.300]  the design of the pro hardware.
[02:21:26.820 --> 02:21:28.940]  But the thing that I know a lot of people,
[02:21:28.940 --> 02:21:30.340]  I've heard this from people,
[02:21:30.340 --> 02:21:33.780]  is that there are a lot of people who, given the,
[02:21:33.780 --> 02:21:38.380]  I don't think debacle is too strong a word
[02:21:38.380 --> 02:21:41.660]  for the trashcan Mac Pro, or at least the mistake
[02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:44.740]  that the trashcan Mac Pro turned out to be,
[02:21:44.740 --> 02:21:46.100]  there's an awful lot of people who are like,
[02:21:46.100 --> 02:21:49.940]  just make a big tower with lots of space in it.
[02:21:49.940 --> 02:21:51.500]  How hard can it be?
[02:21:51.500 --> 02:21:54.540]  There's 10,000 companies doing that for Windows
[02:21:54.540 --> 02:21:56.660]  and just do that.
[02:21:56.660 --> 02:21:58.420]  Just make a big tower with lots of space.
[02:21:58.420 --> 02:22:00.140]  And I think that when Apple was like,
[02:22:00.140 --> 02:22:04.260]  hey, this is gonna take us into 2019.
[02:22:04.260 --> 02:22:06.820]  There's a lot of people who are worried about the Mac Pro
[02:22:06.820 --> 02:22:09.020]  because they're like, well, if they were just gonna make,
[02:22:09.020 --> 02:22:10.380]  if they were gonna do what I want them to do,
[02:22:10.380 --> 02:22:12.220]  which is just make a big tower,
[02:22:12.220 --> 02:22:13.060]  they'd be done already.
[02:22:13.060 --> 02:22:13.900]  The modern cheese grater, yeah.
[02:22:13.900 --> 02:22:15.260]  Right, they'd be done already.
[02:22:15.260 --> 02:22:17.340]  And so therefore they're doing something else
[02:22:17.340 --> 02:22:21.180]  and whatever else they're doing, it's gonna be bad.
[02:22:22.260 --> 02:22:25.540]  And I don't think, I'm just intrigued, honestly.
[02:22:26.660 --> 02:22:29.940]  Cause I'm probably not in the market for the Mac Pro.
[02:22:29.940 --> 02:22:31.700]  I'd be surprised if I were,
[02:22:31.700 --> 02:22:34.780]  but I'm sure curious what it is they've come up with
[02:22:34.780 --> 02:22:37.420]  that isn't just a big tower.
[02:22:39.740 --> 02:22:41.420]  Anyway though, I don't think that's a March thing
[02:22:41.420 --> 02:22:43.140]  while we're speculating on the March event.
[02:22:43.140 --> 02:22:46.140]  I think it's a WWDC thing.
[02:22:46.140 --> 02:22:49.780]  And I also, I don't expect MacBook Pros yet.
[02:22:49.780 --> 02:22:51.500]  I don't think that they would announce them
[02:22:51.500 --> 02:22:53.500]  at this event anyway, but.
[02:22:53.500 --> 02:22:55.100]  Yeah, agreed.
[02:22:55.100 --> 02:22:57.940]  And then our poor old 12 inch Mac book
[02:22:57.940 --> 02:23:01.580]  is desperately in need of a revision, but I don't.
[02:23:01.580 --> 02:23:03.180]  And that has been a March thing,
[02:23:03.180 --> 02:23:05.460]  but would it be again is the question.
[02:23:05.460 --> 02:23:06.300]  Right.
[02:23:06.300 --> 02:23:07.980]  I think it shifted to WWDC two years ago.
[02:23:07.980 --> 02:23:10.460]  Yeah, and if it's just a speed bump, maybe,
[02:23:10.460 --> 02:23:11.300]  but then what do they do?
[02:23:11.300 --> 02:23:12.140]  Do they show it?
[02:23:12.140 --> 02:23:13.180]  How do you show it?
[02:23:13.180 --> 02:23:14.420]  Is it just a press release?
[02:23:14.420 --> 02:23:15.260]  I don't know.
[02:23:15.260 --> 02:23:17.020]  I mean, it's obviously overdue
[02:23:17.020 --> 02:23:21.820]  and it's obviously a product that would sure go great
[02:23:21.820 --> 02:23:24.980]  with the much rumored move to in-house arm chips,
[02:23:24.980 --> 02:23:26.780]  but that's obviously not just going to drop
[02:23:26.780 --> 02:23:28.180]  at the March event.
[02:23:28.180 --> 02:23:29.020]  Yeah.
[02:23:29.020 --> 02:23:29.860]  Yeah.
[02:23:29.860 --> 02:23:31.060]  Everyone wants that computer with an arm chip
[02:23:31.060 --> 02:23:32.620]  and again, face ID.
[02:23:32.620 --> 02:23:34.620]  Everyone's got their hearts set on that already.
[02:23:34.620 --> 02:23:36.020]  Yeah.
[02:23:36.020 --> 02:23:39.300]  And then, so what the other thing that Gurman teased
[02:23:39.300 --> 02:23:41.300]  was a, well, no, it wasn't Gurman.
[02:23:41.300 --> 02:23:44.140]  It was Ming-Chi Kuo who had the idea
[02:23:44.140 --> 02:23:47.740]  of a 16 or 16 and a half inch MacBook Pro
[02:23:47.740 --> 02:23:49.620]  with an all new design.
[02:23:49.620 --> 02:23:50.460]  Yeah.
[02:23:50.460 --> 02:23:53.500]  Which leads me to my last topic, which is,
[02:23:53.500 --> 02:23:55.820]  this popped into my radar last night on Twitter
[02:23:55.820 --> 02:23:59.580]  where Joanna Stern was tweeting with somebody on Twitter,
[02:23:59.580 --> 02:24:03.620]  but she, as a owner of a weeks old new MacBook Air
[02:24:03.620 --> 02:24:05.500]  is already having trouble with the keyboard
[02:24:05.500 --> 02:24:07.340]  with letters getting stuck.
[02:24:07.340 --> 02:24:08.780]  And I forget who she was tweeting with.
[02:24:08.780 --> 02:24:10.940]  I'll put a link in the show notes, I swear.
[02:24:11.820 --> 02:24:13.500]  But then, and it just prompted
[02:24:13.500 --> 02:24:17.460]  a depressingly large number of people
[02:24:17.460 --> 02:24:21.740]  with the latest revision of these keyboards
[02:24:21.740 --> 02:24:23.420]  with the membrane underneath them,
[02:24:23.420 --> 02:24:25.500]  who are saying, yeah, my E key gets stuck
[02:24:25.500 --> 02:24:27.900]  or blank gets stuck, mine's, you know, mine's,
[02:24:27.900 --> 02:24:29.620]  my space bar, Apple has mine
[02:24:29.620 --> 02:24:32.500]  because the space bar was stuck, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:24:34.580 --> 02:24:36.140]  And so I can't help but think,
[02:24:36.140 --> 02:24:39.180]  as much as I like the new MacBook Pro in my testing
[02:24:39.180 --> 02:24:41.220]  and I didn't have any problem with the keys,
[02:24:44.180 --> 02:24:46.260]  but it sure seems like that this,
[02:24:46.260 --> 02:24:48.020]  whatever they've done for the third generation
[02:24:48.020 --> 02:24:49.940]  has not solved the problem.
[02:24:49.940 --> 02:24:51.980]  And at this point, I think we're looking at,
[02:24:51.980 --> 02:24:53.980]  this is truly unacceptable.
[02:24:53.980 --> 02:24:56.260]  Yeah, I've had the same, like I've gone through,
[02:24:56.260 --> 02:24:57.820]  I forget how many now, seven of them,
[02:24:57.820 --> 02:25:00.340]  and I've had one key on one of them,
[02:25:00.340 --> 02:25:02.100]  the control key, give me problems,
[02:25:02.100 --> 02:25:04.700]  but I just popped it off and cleaned it and it was fine.
[02:25:04.700 --> 02:25:08.020]  And I had a key fail on my 2014 MacBook Pro
[02:25:08.020 --> 02:25:09.820]  and I had to take that in and they replaced it
[02:25:09.820 --> 02:25:11.780]  like they would do with a modern one.
[02:25:11.780 --> 02:25:12.900]  But for me, it's the same thing.
[02:25:12.900 --> 02:25:14.260]  Like I love the new keyboard.
[02:25:14.260 --> 02:25:15.580]  I like it way better than the old one,
[02:25:15.580 --> 02:25:17.620]  but the fact that so many people don't like it,
[02:25:17.620 --> 02:25:19.060]  to me, when you have one manufacturer,
[02:25:19.060 --> 02:25:21.060]  it's different if you're like Windows and Dell and HP
[02:25:21.060 --> 02:25:22.860]  and everybody makes, you know, Lenovo,
[02:25:22.860 --> 02:25:23.820]  they all have different computers
[02:25:23.820 --> 02:25:24.780]  so you can have your choice.
[02:25:24.780 --> 02:25:26.300]  You can, if you don't like one keyboard,
[02:25:26.300 --> 02:25:28.300]  buy another manufacturer, it's not a problem.
[02:25:28.300 --> 02:25:30.940]  But Apple's the only one who makes Mac OS laptops
[02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:33.780]  so they can't afford to have anything that's divisive,
[02:25:33.780 --> 02:25:37.460]  whether it's mechanically or just tactically divisive.
[02:25:37.460 --> 02:25:39.380]  You know, and I'll echo everybody who says,
[02:25:39.380 --> 02:25:43.900]  just put the damn iMac keyboard into the MacBook
[02:25:43.900 --> 02:25:44.740]  and call it a day.
[02:25:44.740 --> 02:25:46.180]  That was my, that's my takeaway.
[02:25:46.180 --> 02:25:48.780]  And I've been using it a lot, like I've really,
[02:25:48.780 --> 02:25:51.780]  I've settled on my favorite iPad keyboard setup.
[02:25:51.780 --> 02:25:56.220]  My favorite iPad keyboard setup is the Apple Magic keyboard
[02:25:56.220 --> 02:25:59.980]  in the Studio Neat Canopy folding case,
[02:25:59.980 --> 02:26:02.020]  which I almost never even fold up.
[02:26:02.020 --> 02:26:05.500]  I just leave it open and it's just a place to put it.
[02:26:05.500 --> 02:26:07.660]  And I, for my use,
[02:26:07.660 --> 02:26:10.060]  because I don't do too much writing on the iPad
[02:26:10.060 --> 02:26:12.700]  and I like to hold the iPad naked
[02:26:12.700 --> 02:26:13.980]  without a heavy case on it
[02:26:13.980 --> 02:26:17.860]  so that the Apple keyboard cover is sort of ruled out.
[02:26:17.860 --> 02:26:22.060]  And I, the mag, you know, it's not hard to get it off the magnet
[02:26:22.060 --> 02:26:24.820]  but it's not easy as opposed to just using this canopy
[02:26:24.820 --> 02:26:27.180]  where it just doesn't snap in or anything.
[02:26:27.180 --> 02:26:29.380]  You just lift it in, lift it out, lift it in, lift it out.
[02:26:29.380 --> 02:26:30.420]  And it's a great keyboard.
[02:26:30.420 --> 02:26:32.100]  It is an amazing keyboard.
[02:26:32.100 --> 02:26:33.700]  Yep, it's terrific.
[02:26:33.700 --> 02:26:35.540]  It is super, super, it is,
[02:26:35.540 --> 02:26:38.220]  I'm blown away at how much nicer a keyboard it is
[02:26:38.220 --> 02:26:39.740]  than the old Magic keyboard,
[02:26:39.740 --> 02:26:41.980]  the one that had like the, took AA batteries
[02:26:41.980 --> 02:26:43.420]  and a cylinder on the side.
[02:26:43.420 --> 02:26:44.260]  Like it just-
[02:26:44.260 --> 02:26:45.580]  And it's better than both the old MacBook Pro
[02:26:45.580 --> 02:26:46.820]  and the new MacBook Pro keyboard.
[02:26:46.820 --> 02:26:49.460]  It's really, and it could be, you know,
[02:26:49.460 --> 02:26:53.380]  you can see how it, this could be a laptop keyboard.
[02:26:53.380 --> 02:26:54.220]  Yep.
[02:26:54.220 --> 02:26:55.060]  Oh my God.
[02:26:55.060 --> 02:26:56.420]  So they have the, it's even worse
[02:26:56.420 --> 02:26:57.860]  that they have this amazing keyboard
[02:26:57.860 --> 02:27:01.620]  that the company is making and they're not using it.
[02:27:01.620 --> 02:27:02.460]  But at this point,
[02:27:02.460 --> 02:27:05.340]  and the thought that occurred to me last night on Twitter,
[02:27:05.340 --> 02:27:07.100]  after reading this thread on Twitter
[02:27:07.100 --> 02:27:09.140]  and seeing that there's enough,
[02:27:09.140 --> 02:27:10.940]  nobody ever complained about stuck keys.
[02:27:10.940 --> 02:27:12.980]  I'm not saying that nobody's keys got stuck
[02:27:12.980 --> 02:27:14.700]  on older MacBooks.
[02:27:14.700 --> 02:27:16.820]  It happens, you know, keyboards break.
[02:27:16.820 --> 02:27:17.660]  Yeah, it happened to me.
[02:27:17.660 --> 02:27:19.940]  But there's clearly, clearly a problem
[02:27:19.940 --> 02:27:21.420]  with this butterfly design
[02:27:21.420 --> 02:27:22.860]  that the third generation hasn't solved
[02:27:22.860 --> 02:27:25.940]  where it's way more prevalent than it should be.
[02:27:25.940 --> 02:27:27.620]  And they're just not dependable.
[02:27:27.620 --> 02:27:30.980]  And it's a part of the MacBook that has to be dependable.
[02:27:30.980 --> 02:27:33.420]  Like nobody is buying a MacBook
[02:27:34.380 --> 02:27:36.740]  who doesn't need the keyboard to be reliable.
[02:27:36.740 --> 02:27:39.420]  It's just fundamental to the product.
[02:27:39.420 --> 02:27:41.380]  And the thought that occurred to me
[02:27:41.380 --> 02:27:45.300]  is that this to me is where Apple misses Steve Jobs.
[02:27:45.300 --> 02:27:48.620]  I think, and again, it's dangerous territory
[02:27:48.620 --> 02:27:49.940]  going into the, it would be different
[02:27:49.940 --> 02:27:51.340]  if Steve Jobs were still there.
[02:27:52.540 --> 02:27:54.780]  But I'm more comfortable about it lately
[02:27:54.780 --> 02:27:57.140]  because I really feel like we've got enough distance
[02:27:57.140 --> 02:28:00.460]  from when he died, that it's no longer as,
[02:28:00.460 --> 02:28:01.900]  you know, like an open wound.
[02:28:03.260 --> 02:28:04.900]  But the conventional wisdom seems to be
[02:28:04.900 --> 02:28:06.900]  Apple is gonna miss Steve Jobs
[02:28:06.900 --> 02:28:08.940]  or is, you know, never gonna be the same
[02:28:08.940 --> 02:28:10.620]  because Steve Jobs was the only one
[02:28:10.620 --> 02:28:14.140]  who could lead them to create amazing new products.
[02:28:14.140 --> 02:28:16.700]  You know, that it's this, that the, you know,
[02:28:16.700 --> 02:28:19.740]  you don't get things like the iPod and the iPhone
[02:28:19.740 --> 02:28:21.660]  and the iPad without Steve Jobs.
[02:28:21.660 --> 02:28:24.660]  And that's what Apple's all about.
[02:28:24.660 --> 02:28:26.020]  And I don't think that's true.
[02:28:26.020 --> 02:28:30.620]  And I feel like the watch is proof of that.
[02:28:30.620 --> 02:28:32.180]  AirPods are proof of that.
[02:28:32.180 --> 02:28:35.580]  They've had new products that are terrific
[02:28:35.580 --> 02:28:37.860]  in the last few years.
[02:28:37.860 --> 02:28:42.060]  To me, where they're, I think they miss Steve Jobs,
[02:28:42.060 --> 02:28:43.980]  isn't in the creation of great new things,
[02:28:43.980 --> 02:28:47.300]  it's in addressing problems.
[02:28:47.300 --> 02:28:50.660]  That among the dozens of ways
[02:28:50.660 --> 02:28:54.500]  that he was a terrific CEO of Apple,
[02:28:54.500 --> 02:28:57.780]  I feel like what he did when things went wrong
[02:28:57.780 --> 02:29:02.780]  and his ability to accept it and embrace it
[02:29:03.620 --> 02:29:05.700]  and say, yes, this is terrible, we need to fix it,
[02:29:05.700 --> 02:29:10.700]  famously, there was a story about MobileMe when it launched.
[02:29:11.900 --> 02:29:14.380]  And he held a town hall meeting,
[02:29:14.380 --> 02:29:16.580]  I forget how long after it launched,
[02:29:16.580 --> 02:29:17.980]  but the gist of it was, you know,
[02:29:17.980 --> 02:29:20.180]  there's maybe 150 people could fit in there.
[02:29:20.180 --> 02:29:22.940]  There's a hundred people in the Apple town hall.
[02:29:22.940 --> 02:29:25.980]  And he said, he's up on stage and he says,
[02:29:25.980 --> 02:29:27.020]  let's talk about MobileMe.
[02:29:27.020 --> 02:29:28.780]  What is MobileMe supposed to do?
[02:29:28.780 --> 02:29:31.380]  And I don't know, one or two people in the audience
[02:29:31.380 --> 02:29:33.100]  would give their, you know,
[02:29:33.100 --> 02:29:35.740]  answer and somebody gave an answer that was sufficient,
[02:29:35.740 --> 02:29:36.580]  you know, like, yes, this is,
[02:29:36.580 --> 02:29:38.340]  here's a brief description of what MobileMe
[02:29:38.340 --> 02:29:40.100]  is supposed to be and do.
[02:29:40.100 --> 02:29:42.860]  And he goes, well, why the hell doesn't it do that?
[02:29:42.860 --> 02:29:47.660]  And, you know, in the intervening, you know,
[02:29:47.660 --> 02:29:50.380]  the Apple's got, in my opinion,
[02:29:50.380 --> 02:29:53.260]  Apple has gotten its act together on iCloud.
[02:29:53.260 --> 02:29:56.180]  And I know that, you know, all of a sudden
[02:29:56.180 --> 02:29:58.420]  there's a couple of hundred people listening to this podcast
[02:29:58.420 --> 02:30:00.340]  who are like, well, my contacts still don't sing.
[02:30:00.340 --> 02:30:01.260]  I'm not saying, you know,
[02:30:01.260 --> 02:30:04.220]  it's perfect, but it's really a lot different than it was,
[02:30:04.220 --> 02:30:07.220]  certainly from the MobileMe era in terms of reliability.
[02:30:07.220 --> 02:30:09.620]  One of the things I think he doesn't get enough credit for
[02:30:09.620 --> 02:30:11.500]  is that he was an incredibly strong auteur.
[02:30:11.500 --> 02:30:12.860]  He was very opinionated.
[02:30:12.860 --> 02:30:13.700]  But when you look at like,
[02:30:13.700 --> 02:30:15.220]  he did not want iTunes on Windows,
[02:30:15.220 --> 02:30:17.220]  but he trusted his team and let them do it,
[02:30:17.220 --> 02:30:19.220]  threatening them if it didn't work.
[02:30:19.220 --> 02:30:21.300]  Same with iPad mini, did not want an iPad mini,
[02:30:21.300 --> 02:30:23.460]  trusted his teams that it's your fault if you blow it,
[02:30:23.460 --> 02:30:24.660]  let them do it.
[02:30:24.660 --> 02:30:27.140]  He loved that G4 Cube, it was unacceptable.
[02:30:27.140 --> 02:30:28.300]  So he canceled that thing.
[02:30:28.300 --> 02:30:30.180]  Like it did not last forever.
[02:30:30.180 --> 02:30:33.180]  Like it did not last on the market for five years,
[02:30:33.180 --> 02:30:35.620]  you know, just collecting dust.
[02:30:35.620 --> 02:30:37.540]  He killed that thing.
[02:30:37.540 --> 02:30:39.620]  And that's the part of it I think is absolutely true.
[02:30:39.620 --> 02:30:42.180]  Like you can just imagine him picking up that keyboard
[02:30:42.180 --> 02:30:44.020]  and throwing it across the lab
[02:30:44.020 --> 02:30:45.540]  and saying, why is it still getting stuck?
[02:30:45.540 --> 02:30:47.060]  This is unacceptable, fix this.
[02:30:47.060 --> 02:30:48.900]  Not, you know, next year, two years,
[02:30:48.900 --> 02:30:50.740]  whatever the roadmap is, fix this today.
[02:30:50.740 --> 02:30:51.580]  There's another story.
[02:30:51.580 --> 02:30:55.860]  It was Adam Leshinsky, who I think still writes at Fortune,
[02:30:55.860 --> 02:30:58.420]  but he had a book out a couple of years ago.
[02:30:58.420 --> 02:31:01.540]  Unfortunately, oh, I will get it in the show notes.
[02:31:03.620 --> 02:31:06.260]  But he, one of the stories in his book was
[02:31:07.700 --> 02:31:09.340]  about apparently every time,
[02:31:09.340 --> 02:31:11.500]  I guess there's not that many VPs at Apple,
[02:31:11.500 --> 02:31:13.900]  but every time somebody would get promoted to VP,
[02:31:16.100 --> 02:31:18.940]  Steve Jobs had a spiel that he would give them.
[02:31:18.940 --> 02:31:21.340]  And it was like the parable of the janitor
[02:31:21.340 --> 02:31:22.940]  and the vice president.
[02:31:22.940 --> 02:31:25.300]  And this, I'll paraphrase here,
[02:31:25.300 --> 02:31:29.060]  but I'll put a link where the passage from his book is,
[02:31:29.060 --> 02:31:29.900]  and you can read it.
[02:31:29.900 --> 02:31:33.220]  But the gist of it is you're getting promoted
[02:31:33.220 --> 02:31:35.940]  to a vice president, you meet with Steve Jobs,
[02:31:35.940 --> 02:31:37.300]  and he says, look, here's what the difference
[02:31:37.300 --> 02:31:38.900]  between a janitor and a vice president.
[02:31:38.900 --> 02:31:41.220]  Let's say I'm here in my office
[02:31:41.220 --> 02:31:43.620]  and I notice my trash hasn't been getting emptied
[02:31:43.620 --> 02:31:46.580]  and my waste basket is now overflowing.
[02:31:46.580 --> 02:31:49.220]  And I go to the janitor who's supposed to be emptying
[02:31:49.220 --> 02:31:51.980]  my waste bucket every day.
[02:31:51.980 --> 02:31:55.340]  And I say, hey, I noticed my trash isn't getting emptied.
[02:31:55.340 --> 02:31:56.380]  What's going on?
[02:31:56.380 --> 02:31:57.660]  And the janitor might say,
[02:31:57.660 --> 02:32:01.060]  well, the locks were changed on your office door
[02:32:01.060 --> 02:32:04.300]  and I don't have a key anymore, so I couldn't get in.
[02:32:04.300 --> 02:32:05.740]  That's a reasonable explanation.
[02:32:05.740 --> 02:32:09.340]  And from the janitor, it's a legitimate explanation
[02:32:09.340 --> 02:32:13.060]  for why my trash isn't getting emptied.
[02:32:13.060 --> 02:32:14.580]  And we'll have to figure out something,
[02:32:14.580 --> 02:32:16.220]  get the guy a new key or whatever.
[02:32:16.220 --> 02:32:18.820]  He goes, when you're a vice president,
[02:32:18.820 --> 02:32:20.460]  you no longer get excuses.
[02:32:20.460 --> 02:32:22.580]  There is no excuse.
[02:32:22.580 --> 02:32:24.100]  You need to empty the trash.
[02:32:24.100 --> 02:32:25.020]  And if you can't get in,
[02:32:25.020 --> 02:32:28.660]  you need to figure it out and fix it.
[02:32:28.660 --> 02:32:30.300]  Which in turn reminds me of the story
[02:32:30.300 --> 02:32:32.260]  of Scott Forstall and the iPhone team
[02:32:32.260 --> 02:32:34.820]  when at some point during the development,
[02:32:34.820 --> 02:32:37.140]  remember the story where during the original development
[02:32:37.140 --> 02:32:40.740]  of the iPhone, somebody, some woman on the team,
[02:32:40.740 --> 02:32:42.660]  there was an argument, tempers were flaring
[02:32:42.660 --> 02:32:44.580]  and she slammed the door to her office
[02:32:44.580 --> 02:32:49.180]  and it broke the lock or the latch and she couldn't get out.
[02:32:49.180 --> 02:32:51.940]  And did you ever hear this story?
[02:32:51.940 --> 02:32:54.500]  I think it was in Ken Kashenda's book.
[02:32:55.820 --> 02:32:57.100]  Oh, maybe then, yeah, I read the book.
[02:32:57.100 --> 02:33:00.780]  And they're on a deadline and Forstall,
[02:33:00.780 --> 02:33:03.300]  she's locked in there and they've got work to do.
[02:33:03.300 --> 02:33:05.020]  And so Forstall, somebody had a baseball bat
[02:33:05.020 --> 02:33:06.700]  and Forstall just took a baseball bat
[02:33:06.700 --> 02:33:10.700]  and just bashed her door in to get her out, right?
[02:33:10.700 --> 02:33:11.540]  But they weren't gonna wait.
[02:33:11.540 --> 02:33:12.380]  It's like, you know what I mean?
[02:33:12.380 --> 02:33:15.620]  But it's almost like Forstall almost exemplified
[02:33:15.620 --> 02:33:19.860]  what Jobs is talking about and that they needed her
[02:33:19.860 --> 02:33:22.500]  to be, they needed her that night to do work
[02:33:22.500 --> 02:33:24.660]  and she locked in her room and they're not gonna wait
[02:33:24.660 --> 02:33:27.260]  for building services to come, just take a baseball bat
[02:33:27.260 --> 02:33:28.580]  and tell her to stand away from the door
[02:33:28.580 --> 02:33:29.900]  and bash the doorknob in.
[02:33:31.340 --> 02:33:35.540]  Anyway, my thinking on that is that there's some VP
[02:33:35.540 --> 02:33:38.460]  who's ultimately responsible for this keyboard.
[02:33:38.460 --> 02:33:41.100]  And to me, the time for excuses is over.
[02:33:41.100 --> 02:33:46.100]  And again, I am not presumptive enough to say,
[02:33:46.420 --> 02:33:48.260]  call for somebody to be fired.
[02:33:48.260 --> 02:33:51.660]  I mean, it's, you know, but I,
[02:33:51.660 --> 02:33:53.900]  so I don't take this lightly, but to me,
[02:33:53.900 --> 02:33:57.180]  this is to the point where maybe somebody should be fired.
[02:33:57.180 --> 02:33:59.420]  Like, I think it's that serious.
[02:33:59.420 --> 02:34:01.220]  And where does the buck stop?
[02:34:01.220 --> 02:34:06.220]  And my fear is that in the post Steve Jobs, Apple,
[02:34:06.300 --> 02:34:09.180]  this keyboard, MacBook keyboard thing is,
[02:34:09.180 --> 02:34:14.060]  is off on its own.
[02:34:14.060 --> 02:34:17.180]  And the people who are deciding how to fix it
[02:34:17.180 --> 02:34:19.560]  and what to do going forward are the same people
[02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:22.560]  who designed it and approved it in the first place.
[02:34:23.740 --> 02:34:26.820]  Well, I mean, they have fired people in the recent past
[02:34:26.820 --> 02:34:29.020]  for stuff like, like not for the keyboard,
[02:34:29.020 --> 02:34:31.260]  but for issues that involve products being late
[02:34:31.260 --> 02:34:32.600]  and not being delivered on time
[02:34:32.600 --> 02:34:34.180]  or problems with the products.
[02:34:34.180 --> 02:34:36.020]  Like some of the people who were in charge
[02:34:36.020 --> 02:34:37.880]  of those two years ago, three years ago,
[02:34:37.880 --> 02:34:39.520]  were no longer there.
[02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:41.160]  They're just, it's just not very public.
[02:34:41.160 --> 02:34:44.240]  So I'm, this is just particularly bewildering
[02:34:44.240 --> 02:34:47.060]  because it's been so, like the sentiment around it
[02:34:47.060 --> 02:34:48.020]  is so toxic.
[02:34:48.020 --> 02:34:50.020]  You just have all these, like people like Joanna,
[02:34:50.020 --> 02:34:50.860]  people like Casey Neistat,
[02:34:50.860 --> 02:34:53.180]  people who get a ton of attention,
[02:34:53.180 --> 02:34:56.660]  Casey Johnston railing on it all the time and nothing,
[02:34:56.660 --> 02:34:57.500]  you know, and they did that, you know,
[02:34:57.500 --> 02:34:58.340]  and maybe you can say, oh,
[02:34:58.340 --> 02:34:59.860]  we're going to fix it with a membrane,
[02:34:59.860 --> 02:35:02.520]  but it just, it's, it's, it doesn't get fixed.
[02:35:02.520 --> 02:35:04.900]  And that is not really like, to your point,
[02:35:04.900 --> 02:35:06.460]  that's not really how things got done.
[02:35:06.460 --> 02:35:10.940]  It's, it's doing reputational harm to the MacBook brand.
[02:35:10.940 --> 02:35:15.220]  And it is, it's truly, this, in my opinion,
[02:35:15.220 --> 02:35:17.020]  the second most important brand at the company
[02:35:17.020 --> 02:35:17.960]  behind the phone.
[02:35:17.960 --> 02:35:20.920]  I mean, you can argue, it would be a fine argument to make,
[02:35:20.920 --> 02:35:23.320]  to say iPad is more important than MacBook,
[02:35:23.320 --> 02:35:25.160]  but it's at least close.
[02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:27.360]  But in terms of, you know, units,
[02:35:27.360 --> 02:35:29.600]  they sell a lot more iPads, but in terms of revenue,
[02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:30.940]  they sell more MacBooks.
[02:35:32.200 --> 02:35:34.620]  Like they didn't leave that antenna busted for three years
[02:35:34.620 --> 02:35:35.460]  on the iPhone 4.
[02:35:35.460 --> 02:35:37.200]  And that was fixed by the time it was on Verizon.
[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:40.120]  Right, it was, yeah, it didn't even take a year.
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:40.960]  Yeah.
[02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:42.380]  It was already fixed in the, in development.
[02:35:42.380 --> 02:35:43.900]  Or the iPhone 6, like, you know,
[02:35:43.900 --> 02:35:46.900]  they fixed the structural integrity of that by iPhone 6s.
[02:35:46.900 --> 02:35:47.740]  Right.
[02:35:47.740 --> 02:35:48.560]  You know, all these things.
[02:35:48.560 --> 02:35:49.400]  Right.
[02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:50.240]  Fixed.
[02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:55.240]  It, it, it, I feel like that revision last summer
[02:35:56.820 --> 02:35:58.840]  with the, okay, here's our third generation.
[02:35:58.840 --> 02:36:00.160]  We've added a membrane.
[02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:02.300]  Officially, they're only saying
[02:36:02.300 --> 02:36:04.060]  that the membrane makes it quieter.
[02:36:04.060 --> 02:36:07.020]  Yeah, I'm assuming that was for legal reasons.
[02:36:07.020 --> 02:36:07.860]  Right.
[02:36:07.860 --> 02:36:09.420]  Well, I think for many reasons,
[02:36:09.420 --> 02:36:11.140]  but I think legal among them.
[02:36:12.140 --> 02:36:14.180]  But unofficially was, you know,
[02:36:14.180 --> 02:36:16.700]  also intended to prevent, what do you call it?
[02:36:16.700 --> 02:36:19.940]  Egress, you know, prevent particles from getting in there
[02:36:19.940 --> 02:36:22.660]  and causing problems, causing keys to get stuck
[02:36:22.660 --> 02:36:24.640]  or malfunction or I guess a lot of people
[02:36:24.640 --> 02:36:25.820]  are having a problem with the space bar
[02:36:25.820 --> 02:36:26.960]  where it's not, doesn't get stuck,
[02:36:26.960 --> 02:36:28.840]  but they hit the space bar and you get two spaces
[02:36:28.840 --> 02:36:29.680]  instead of one.
[02:36:29.680 --> 02:36:30.520]  Yeah.
[02:36:31.420 --> 02:36:33.620]  Which I guess isn't as bad a problem,
[02:36:33.620 --> 02:36:34.940]  but it's, again, it's awful.
[02:36:34.940 --> 02:36:37.780]  You just expect, you know, I've been using,
[02:36:37.780 --> 02:36:41.260]  I've got a MacBook Pro here that it's a 2014
[02:36:41.260 --> 02:36:46.260]  that I've used thousands of, thousands of times since 2014
[02:36:46.260 --> 02:36:49.360]  and I, to the best of my knowledge,
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:50.900]  I've never once hit the space bar
[02:36:50.900 --> 02:36:52.340]  and had two spaces appear.
[02:36:52.340 --> 02:36:55.500]  So I, seriously, how many times have I used the space,
[02:36:55.500 --> 02:36:59.280]  have I typed a space on this MacBook Pro?
[02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:01.000]  You know, here's, it's like one of those job interview
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:05.300]  puzzles, like, hmm, what's a good estimate?
[02:37:05.300 --> 02:37:08.100]  Typical, if I write, typical,
[02:37:08.100 --> 02:37:09.960]  if I write a couple thousand words a day,
[02:37:09.960 --> 02:37:13.260]  every word is separated by a space, right?
[02:37:13.260 --> 02:37:18.260]  So thousands of words, thousands of days, right?
[02:37:19.460 --> 02:37:20.820]  Easily millions, right?
[02:37:20.820 --> 02:37:22.660]  I, it sounds ridiculous.
[02:37:22.660 --> 02:37:25.220]  Do you think what you've typed millions of spaces?
[02:37:25.220 --> 02:37:27.420]  But if I type thousands of words a day
[02:37:27.420 --> 02:37:29.900]  over several thousand days, you know,
[02:37:29.900 --> 02:37:32.660]  and this has been five, almost four and a half years,
[02:37:32.660 --> 02:37:35.060]  I don't think it's ridiculous to think I've typed
[02:37:35.060 --> 02:37:38.280]  a million or two spaces with this keyboard
[02:37:38.280 --> 02:37:41.300]  and I've, to my knowledge, I can't recall one time,
[02:37:41.300 --> 02:37:43.940]  not even one in a million, where I've gotten two spaces.
[02:37:43.940 --> 02:37:46.780]  That's how, and that's not crazy, that's not like,
[02:37:46.780 --> 02:37:49.140]  oh, only Apple made keyboards where you hit the space
[02:37:49.140 --> 02:37:50.900]  and you all, you know, a million times in a row
[02:37:50.900 --> 02:37:52.940]  and get one space, I mean, that's, you know,
[02:37:52.940 --> 02:37:55.900]  pretty common on quality laptops from any brand.
[02:37:55.900 --> 02:37:58.980]  I really think that this is causing irreparable,
[02:37:58.980 --> 02:38:02.020]  not irreparable, but serious reputational harm
[02:38:02.020 --> 02:38:04.980]  to the MacBook brand that will outlast the keyboards.
[02:38:04.980 --> 02:38:07.220]  Like even they're at the point now where they can fix it
[02:38:07.220 --> 02:38:09.860]  and it's still going to be in people's minds
[02:38:09.860 --> 02:38:13.060]  that MacBooks aren't, don't have reliable keyboards.
[02:38:13.060 --> 02:38:14.560]  Yeah, they'll wonder every time they buy one,
[02:38:14.560 --> 02:38:15.620]  whether it's gonna be reliable or not,
[02:38:15.620 --> 02:38:17.160]  which is the last thing you want them wondering.
[02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:18.460]  Right.
[02:38:18.460 --> 02:38:22.380]  And on the other side of the same surface,
[02:38:22.380 --> 02:38:25.300]  the track pads are so amazingly good.
[02:38:25.300 --> 02:38:28.620]  Like it's, you know, the new track pad
[02:38:28.620 --> 02:38:31.820]  that doesn't use the diving board mechanism, you know,
[02:38:31.820 --> 02:38:33.380]  where it's all virtual clicking
[02:38:33.380 --> 02:38:35.460]  and it feels like real clicking
[02:38:35.460 --> 02:38:37.860]  and it's equally clickable at the top and the bottom
[02:38:37.860 --> 02:38:40.080]  and there, it made it nice and big.
[02:38:42.460 --> 02:38:45.260]  You know, that's right in the MacBook brand, you know,
[02:38:45.260 --> 02:38:46.900]  best track pads in the industry,
[02:38:46.900 --> 02:38:48.260]  that's part of the MacBook brand,
[02:38:48.260 --> 02:38:50.220]  best keyboards in the industry should be too.
[02:38:50.220 --> 02:38:53.660]  And instead it's arguably the worst keyboards
[02:38:53.660 --> 02:38:54.500]  in the industry.
[02:38:55.980 --> 02:38:57.180]  Something's gotta happen.
[02:38:57.180 --> 02:38:59.300]  It's hard to believe the two things came
[02:38:59.300 --> 02:39:00.620]  from the same engineering division.
[02:39:00.620 --> 02:39:02.580]  And I can't help but think,
[02:39:02.580 --> 02:39:05.060]  it's almost like Apple's in a bad spot where,
[02:39:06.180 --> 02:39:08.460]  like the MacBook Airs just came out, you know,
[02:39:08.460 --> 02:39:10.180]  and they're not, you know,
[02:39:11.620 --> 02:39:14.020]  they can either stick with this keyboard design
[02:39:14.020 --> 02:39:16.540]  and have all the, you know,
[02:39:16.540 --> 02:39:18.980]  suffer the continuing degradation of the brand
[02:39:18.980 --> 02:39:21.620]  and the confidence people have in these products,
[02:39:21.620 --> 02:39:24.580]  or they can fix it with a new keyboard design,
[02:39:24.580 --> 02:39:27.420]  which means they're upgrading, updating the hardware
[02:39:28.700 --> 02:39:31.540]  sooner than they had expected to, you know,
[02:39:31.540 --> 02:39:33.100]  and at a cost to the company, you know,
[02:39:33.100 --> 02:39:37.140]  that they expect to get X number of years out of a design.
[02:39:37.140 --> 02:39:37.980]  Yeah.
[02:39:38.820 --> 02:39:43.020]  Yeah, no, and it's, it seems like we'll see with this,
[02:39:43.020 --> 02:39:45.620]  so the 16 inch MacBook Pro is supposed to be
[02:39:46.540 --> 02:39:49.340]  sort of like a 17 inch screen put into a 15 inch chassis.
[02:39:49.340 --> 02:39:51.180]  It was sort of like what we had with the iPhone
[02:39:51.180 --> 02:39:54.060]  and the iPad Pro and a complete redesign.
[02:39:54.060 --> 02:39:56.540]  So this, it's kind of weird.
[02:39:56.540 --> 02:39:58.580]  We didn't see this with the MacBook Air,
[02:39:58.580 --> 02:40:01.220]  but that looks like it's using the exact same process
[02:40:01.220 --> 02:40:02.340]  as the previous one.
[02:40:02.340 --> 02:40:03.900]  This, if this is a new design
[02:40:03.900 --> 02:40:05.580]  and they stick with the same keyboard,
[02:40:05.580 --> 02:40:07.860]  it's going to be flabbergasting.
[02:40:07.860 --> 02:40:08.700]  What do you think?
[02:40:08.700 --> 02:40:10.420]  So do you think if it's true that they're coming out
[02:40:10.420 --> 02:40:15.420]  with a 16 or whatever inch MacBook Pro,
[02:40:15.740 --> 02:40:19.020]  do you think it's like effectively the 15 inch footprint,
[02:40:19.020 --> 02:40:20.980]  but with more of an edge to edge display,
[02:40:20.980 --> 02:40:25.660]  not a return of the lunch tray 17 inch footprint?
[02:40:25.660 --> 02:40:27.420]  The destroyer, the battleship.
[02:40:27.420 --> 02:40:30.340]  Which, again, my wife was a huge fan of.
[02:40:30.340 --> 02:40:31.420]  She read this rumor.
[02:40:31.420 --> 02:40:32.540]  I didn't even tell her
[02:40:32.540 --> 02:40:33.700]  because I didn't want to get her hopes up
[02:40:33.700 --> 02:40:35.220]  and somehow she found it on her own.
[02:40:35.220 --> 02:40:37.100]  I think a friend of the show, Paul Kefasis,
[02:40:37.100 --> 02:40:38.660]  told her in a text message
[02:40:38.660 --> 02:40:40.700]  and now she's all hepped up about it.
[02:40:40.700 --> 02:40:41.540]  But I told her, I was like,
[02:40:41.540 --> 02:40:44.180]  I don't think it's going to be that.
[02:40:44.180 --> 02:40:46.380]  I mean, you can get the 15 inch MacBook
[02:40:46.380 --> 02:40:47.500]  and it'll have a bigger display,
[02:40:47.500 --> 02:40:51.380]  but I don't think you're getting the big iMac,
[02:40:51.380 --> 02:40:55.300]  17 inch iMac in a laptop that we had before.
[02:40:55.300 --> 02:41:00.060]  I used to joke, where's my iMac, my iMacbook Pro?
[02:41:00.060 --> 02:41:02.180]  But really there's so many technologies
[02:41:02.180 --> 02:41:04.260]  that Apple hasn't brought down to the MacBook line,
[02:41:04.260 --> 02:41:06.980]  including the new design language, which is the iPhone 10
[02:41:06.980 --> 02:41:09.580]  and this year's, sorry, last year's iPad Pro
[02:41:09.580 --> 02:41:11.300]  that it's sort of really easy to see
[02:41:11.300 --> 02:41:14.580]  where those cues would make sense on a MacBook Pro.
[02:41:14.580 --> 02:41:18.740]  And we look at the LG Gram, the LG Gram is a 17 inch laptop
[02:41:18.740 --> 02:41:20.660]  that looks like it's something from the future
[02:41:20.660 --> 02:41:22.540]  and that's where the industry is moving.
[02:41:22.540 --> 02:41:23.740]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:41:23.740 --> 02:41:27.380]  And then Jackie Chang, who's now working,
[02:41:27.380 --> 02:41:28.700]  she used to be at Ars Technica,
[02:41:28.700 --> 02:41:31.860]  then she was at Wirecutter and now she's at,
[02:41:31.860 --> 02:41:33.180]  I forget which radio station,
[02:41:33.180 --> 02:41:35.180]  she's at a classical radio station in New York
[02:41:35.180 --> 02:41:36.860]  as their editorial director.
[02:41:36.860 --> 02:41:39.340]  Sorry, Jackie, I don't remember the radio station,
[02:41:39.340 --> 02:41:42.060]  but she mentioned that at her new job,
[02:41:42.060 --> 02:41:45.140]  they got her a new 13 inch MacBook Air
[02:41:45.140 --> 02:41:47.660]  that she's work provided, so she's using it,
[02:41:47.660 --> 02:41:52.340]  but for her, it's replacing a 2013 MacBook Air
[02:41:52.340 --> 02:41:54.860]  that she owned and that the only real thing she notices
[02:41:54.860 --> 02:41:56.460]  that's better is the retina display,
[02:41:56.460 --> 02:41:58.500]  which is obvious and it's a big thing
[02:41:58.500 --> 02:41:59.620]  to put an asterisk next to.
[02:41:59.620 --> 02:42:02.100]  I mean, it's obviously a nicer display,
[02:42:02.100 --> 02:42:04.500]  but I tweeted to her, I was like,
[02:42:04.500 --> 02:42:07.860]  and conversely, in 2013, when you got a MacBook Air,
[02:42:07.860 --> 02:42:11.900]  if you were replacing a then five-year-old 2008 MacBook
[02:42:11.900 --> 02:42:16.020]  of some sort, you're like amazed in a lot of ways.
[02:42:16.020 --> 02:42:17.900]  Like, there's like, wow, this is so much faster
[02:42:17.900 --> 02:42:19.460]  and it's so much thinner and it's so much lighter
[02:42:19.460 --> 02:42:21.900]  and the display's better and the trackpad's better,
[02:42:21.900 --> 02:42:24.020]  you know, and the list goes on and on.
[02:42:25.580 --> 02:42:30.580]  There's a certain lack of wow in a new MacBook today
[02:42:31.740 --> 02:42:33.820]  compared to five years ago.
[02:42:33.820 --> 02:42:36.620]  And like that MacBook Air, like not the first one,
[02:42:36.620 --> 02:42:40.820]  the second one, it redefined all laptops for half a decade,
[02:42:40.820 --> 02:42:42.740]  like they became the model for the Ultrabooks
[02:42:42.740 --> 02:42:44.700]  and no one else has done that yet.
[02:42:44.700 --> 02:42:45.740]  It's not just an Apple thing.
[02:42:45.740 --> 02:42:48.920]  Like there are very advanced laptops that are very nice.
[02:42:48.920 --> 02:42:50.660]  There are gaming laptops that have like all sorts
[02:42:50.660 --> 02:42:52.020]  of neon keys, but there's nothing
[02:42:52.020 --> 02:42:54.020]  that's been industry transformative.
[02:42:54.020 --> 02:42:55.740]  I think that's, again, similar to like,
[02:42:55.740 --> 02:42:57.320]  because people like to make things about Apple,
[02:42:57.320 --> 02:42:58.620]  but when you look at the phone market,
[02:42:58.620 --> 02:42:59.900]  the same things are true for Apple
[02:42:59.900 --> 02:43:02.320]  that are for Samsung and Huawei and everybody.
[02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:05.380]  We've just reached a point where this stuff has been,
[02:43:05.380 --> 02:43:07.540]  it's like the old Excel thing, Excel looks like Lotus
[02:43:07.540 --> 02:43:09.780]  because that's what the job it has to do.
[02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:12.220]  And we've reached that point where we've chiseled away
[02:43:12.220 --> 02:43:14.920]  almost everything unnecessary and you can play around
[02:43:14.920 --> 02:43:16.980]  with it, you can give it fancy casings and light ups
[02:43:16.980 --> 02:43:18.820]  and things like that, but they're just so good
[02:43:18.820 --> 02:43:21.900]  at doing that job, unless someone has a really new way,
[02:43:21.900 --> 02:43:24.500]  like the MacBook Air was a really new way
[02:43:24.500 --> 02:43:27.660]  of making these computers, unibody was a huge shift.
[02:43:27.660 --> 02:43:30.100]  It's hard to see what that next huge leap forward is
[02:43:30.100 --> 02:43:32.820]  unless it is something like the iPad Pro or the Surface
[02:43:32.820 --> 02:43:36.060]  or these transformables.
[02:43:36.060 --> 02:43:37.660]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:43:37.660 --> 02:43:41.020]  So anyway, bottom line, I don't expect MacBooks at March,
[02:43:41.020 --> 02:43:44.500]  but maybe, I don't know, probably not Pros,
[02:43:44.500 --> 02:43:48.320]  but maybe an updated 12-inch, but nothing,
[02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:50.540]  I don't expect, radical.
[02:43:51.540 --> 02:43:53.320]  And the keyboard saga will go on.
[02:43:54.240 --> 02:43:55.080]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:43:56.260 --> 02:43:57.460]  Anything else you wanted to talk about
[02:43:57.460 --> 02:43:59.380]  before we cut off for the week?
[02:43:59.380 --> 02:44:02.540]  No, I mean, I think we hit all the big nails on there.
[02:44:02.540 --> 02:44:04.860]  Let me ask you this, I'm so curious about you
[02:44:04.860 --> 02:44:08.340]  and your continued drive into being a YouTuber,
[02:44:08.340 --> 02:44:10.060]  and like I said, I'm really enjoying,
[02:44:10.060 --> 02:44:14.220]  I think it's just that you wanna get better at something,
[02:44:14.220 --> 02:44:17.300]  do it, like you've always been good at the videos,
[02:44:17.300 --> 02:44:20.780]  but since you've like doubled down on Vector
[02:44:20.780 --> 02:44:25.580]  and your YouTube channel, when did that start?
[02:44:25.580 --> 02:44:26.980]  Was that like a year ago?
[02:44:26.980 --> 02:44:28.500]  Almost literally a year ago.
[02:44:28.500 --> 02:44:30.740]  It was the HomePod review was my first video.
[02:44:30.740 --> 02:44:35.180]  And it's, you've gotten so much better,
[02:44:35.180 --> 02:44:37.580]  like your recent videos, I mean, I've been into them
[02:44:37.580 --> 02:44:40.180]  and I enjoyed your HomePod review.
[02:44:40.180 --> 02:44:41.780]  It's not like you were bad and now you're good,
[02:44:41.780 --> 02:44:46.100]  but you've clearly gotten a style down to the show.
[02:44:48.460 --> 02:44:49.900]  And I'm just curious how long,
[02:44:50.900 --> 02:44:54.940]  how much time that consumes of your week?
[02:44:54.940 --> 02:44:56.500]  Almost all my time right now,
[02:44:56.500 --> 02:44:58.980]  because I have this weird affliction
[02:44:58.980 --> 02:45:01.020]  where like when I blogged, I had to blog continuously
[02:45:01.020 --> 02:45:03.580]  and when I made podcasts, I wanted to do it daily.
[02:45:03.580 --> 02:45:05.660]  And now I'm trying to do YouTube videos daily
[02:45:05.660 --> 02:45:09.620]  and they take so much more time than a podcast
[02:45:09.620 --> 02:45:11.300]  because of a lot of the editing and B-roll
[02:45:11.300 --> 02:45:14.100]  and you have to be visual and audio and all these things.
[02:45:14.100 --> 02:45:15.980]  But it feels like it's the only way to get good to me.
[02:45:15.980 --> 02:45:19.580]  Like I'm not good at being good otherwise,
[02:45:19.580 --> 02:45:22.300]  I just, I learn everything by doing it.
[02:45:22.300 --> 02:45:24.940]  So it takes, I wake up and I film a video
[02:45:24.940 --> 02:45:26.500]  and I spend most of the rest of the day editing it
[02:45:26.500 --> 02:45:28.100]  and then I post it the next morning
[02:45:28.100 --> 02:45:29.940]  or in the evening if it's more urgent.
[02:45:29.940 --> 02:45:32.580]  And what's your current setup?
[02:45:32.580 --> 02:45:34.260]  Like how are you reading the script?
[02:45:34.260 --> 02:45:36.100]  Like, do you have like a teleprompter type thing?
[02:45:36.100 --> 02:45:37.900]  Like could you use an iPad?
[02:45:37.900 --> 02:45:39.420]  I mean.
[02:45:39.420 --> 02:45:41.460]  I didn't initially and then people told me
[02:45:41.460 --> 02:45:43.060]  I spoke way too quickly.
[02:45:43.060 --> 02:45:47.820]  And so I got Joe Chaplinsky, you know, friend of the show,
[02:45:47.820 --> 02:45:51.260]  he does the, he does podcasts, he's in Whiskus' band,
[02:45:51.260 --> 02:45:53.660]  really amazing, they do a teleprompter plus plus app.
[02:45:53.660 --> 02:45:55.140]  And I set it like at a speed
[02:45:55.140 --> 02:45:57.300]  that was uncomfortably slow for me
[02:45:57.300 --> 02:46:01.060]  so that I would force myself to slow down and it's working
[02:46:01.060 --> 02:46:03.140]  and I have a combination of things in there
[02:46:03.140 --> 02:46:06.020]  and notes and bullet points that I wanna make sure I hit.
[02:46:06.020 --> 02:46:08.260]  And what's that, an iPad app?
[02:46:08.260 --> 02:46:09.220]  Yeah, it's an iPad app
[02:46:09.220 --> 02:46:10.420]  and you can run it off your iPhone.
[02:46:10.420 --> 02:46:12.660]  So I can, sometimes I often have a friend with me
[02:46:12.660 --> 02:46:14.340]  helping me do all, do everything
[02:46:14.340 --> 02:46:17.940]  but I can put it next to my, next to me on what I'm reading
[02:46:17.940 --> 02:46:20.420]  and then just go up and down on the iPhone
[02:46:20.420 --> 02:46:21.260]  and that'll adjust the iPad app.
[02:46:21.260 --> 02:46:23.820]  And what camera are you using?
[02:46:23.820 --> 02:46:26.420]  I'm using the Panasonic GH5
[02:46:26.420 --> 02:46:28.020]  just because it was well-regarded.
[02:46:28.020 --> 02:46:29.460]  I know a lot of people like the Sonys
[02:46:29.460 --> 02:46:30.980]  but I like the fact that I can turn it around
[02:46:30.980 --> 02:46:33.900]  and see myself in the viewfinder.
[02:46:35.900 --> 02:46:37.300]  Well, I'm really enjoying it
[02:46:37.300 --> 02:46:39.180]  and I'm not surprised in the least.
[02:46:40.180 --> 02:46:43.260]  Find out that it's taking you all day every day to do it
[02:46:43.260 --> 02:46:44.660]  because it really does show.
[02:46:45.540 --> 02:46:46.380]  Thank you.
[02:46:46.380 --> 02:46:47.540]  That is the thing, that's one of the other things I've heard
[02:46:47.540 --> 02:46:49.380]  is that in the growth of this,
[02:46:49.380 --> 02:46:50.860]  and I hate the word influencer,
[02:46:50.860 --> 02:46:52.060]  this whole influencer thing,
[02:46:52.060 --> 02:46:54.860]  but there's obviously a lot of people who, you know,
[02:46:54.860 --> 02:46:59.860]  who are, and I, as an independent content producer myself,
[02:47:03.180 --> 02:47:07.900]  the YouTube thing is far field from what I've done
[02:47:07.900 --> 02:47:10.900]  or a field, maybe not far field,
[02:47:10.900 --> 02:47:14.580]  but I'm impressed by the success people are having
[02:47:14.580 --> 02:47:16.540]  and I'm not surprised because, you know,
[02:47:16.540 --> 02:47:18.260]  TV was so popular, you know,
[02:47:18.260 --> 02:47:21.260]  in the last millennium or century.
[02:47:21.260 --> 02:47:23.660]  It's no surprise that these, this, you know,
[02:47:23.660 --> 02:47:27.380]  making these little eight minute ish things in this century
[02:47:27.380 --> 02:47:32.380]  has proven to be a million viewer popular
[02:47:33.540 --> 02:47:34.620]  for a lot of people.
[02:47:35.460 --> 02:47:40.100]  But I keep reading that it is super, super consuming
[02:47:40.100 --> 02:47:44.020]  because the way, you know, the algorithm works,
[02:47:44.020 --> 02:47:46.900]  the algorithms work at YouTube.
[02:47:46.900 --> 02:47:50.340]  It's, you can get, getting popular is great,
[02:47:50.340 --> 02:47:51.540]  but to stay popular,
[02:47:51.540 --> 02:47:53.580]  you really need to keep pumping out the videos
[02:47:53.580 --> 02:47:55.500]  and you can't, you know, there's,
[02:47:55.500 --> 02:47:59.980]  the quality demands don't go down in terms of, you know,
[02:47:59.980 --> 02:48:04.140]  tightness of editing and camera work, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:48:04.140 --> 02:48:06.060]  I mean, that's true to, that's true to some extent.
[02:48:06.060 --> 02:48:07.380]  Well, the interesting thing for me is like,
[02:48:07.380 --> 02:48:09.260]  if you look at like, like Shane Dawson,
[02:48:09.260 --> 02:48:11.780]  who's hugely popular or a CGP Grey friend, you know,
[02:48:11.780 --> 02:48:13.860]  mutual friend, they don't release a lot of videos,
[02:48:13.860 --> 02:48:16.420]  but when they do they're like absolute events
[02:48:17.380 --> 02:48:21.140]  and they get just ungodly amounts of attention.
[02:48:21.140 --> 02:48:24.780]  For me, it's just that I'm still not good enough
[02:48:24.780 --> 02:48:27.740]  at filming that I can capture the story in the camera.
[02:48:27.740 --> 02:48:29.660]  So I do a lot of work in the edit,
[02:48:29.660 --> 02:48:30.980]  which means I can't hand it off
[02:48:30.980 --> 02:48:32.620]  to anybody else to do for me.
[02:48:32.620 --> 02:48:33.620]  And I'm not sure I would anyway,
[02:48:33.620 --> 02:48:35.900]  like the, like I've had podcasts edited for a long time.
[02:48:35.900 --> 02:48:38.780]  Jim Metzendorf does a great job with that for me,
[02:48:38.780 --> 02:48:41.780]  but with the video, I'm still telling the story in the edit
[02:48:41.780 --> 02:48:43.180]  and that's what takes so long for me.
[02:48:43.180 --> 02:48:44.860]  I enjoy, I also enjoy,
[02:48:44.860 --> 02:48:46.380]  and I think you're getting clever at it,
[02:48:46.380 --> 02:48:49.900]  is the, your integration of the sponsor reads
[02:48:49.900 --> 02:48:53.260]  into the script where, and it's almost,
[02:48:53.260 --> 02:48:56.700]  it's like you're, I don't think you'll take it
[02:48:56.700 --> 02:48:59.660]  the wrong way, you're sort of cornball,
[02:48:59.660 --> 02:49:02.540]  you like a pun, you know, you do like a pun.
[02:49:02.540 --> 02:49:04.740]  And so sometimes the way you work it in,
[02:49:04.740 --> 02:49:06.460]  it's supposed to be a little corny
[02:49:06.460 --> 02:49:07.660]  in the way that you work it in,
[02:49:07.660 --> 02:49:10.140]  but it's not abrupt, like the Skillshare one
[02:49:10.140 --> 02:49:13.020]  in the most recent one that I watched,
[02:49:13.020 --> 02:49:17.060]  it was just super funny, I thought, and very clever.
[02:49:17.060 --> 02:49:22.060]  And, you know, in a world where people are, you know,
[02:49:24.540 --> 02:49:26.620]  blocking, you know, using software to block ads,
[02:49:26.620 --> 02:49:28.940]  like to me and it, you know, it's near and dear to my heart
[02:49:28.940 --> 02:49:32.300]  as the person doing a podcast with these sponsorship things
[02:49:32.300 --> 02:49:34.820]  is how do you make ads that not only people
[02:49:34.820 --> 02:49:37.220]  don't wanna block, but they actually wanna listen to?
[02:49:37.220 --> 02:49:38.060]  And, you know.
[02:49:38.060 --> 02:49:40.180]  Yeah, well, I mean, you were also a huge inspiration
[02:49:40.180 --> 02:49:42.980]  for that because like, I don't turn on Google Analytics,
[02:49:42.980 --> 02:49:45.940]  I don't turn on Google, it's not even set up on the account,
[02:49:45.940 --> 02:49:48.980]  there's no overlay ads, there's no pre-roll, mid-roll,
[02:49:48.980 --> 02:49:51.100]  post-roll, you're never getting interrupted with that.
[02:49:51.100 --> 02:49:52.960]  And I use the strict sponsorship model
[02:49:52.960 --> 02:49:55.860]  and I want it to not feel,
[02:49:55.860 --> 02:49:59.980]  I just want it to be as an enjoyable experience as possible.
[02:49:59.980 --> 02:50:02.820]  And so I try to like be tongue in cheek with it.
[02:50:02.820 --> 02:50:04.460]  And then I try to keep it as short as possible
[02:50:04.460 --> 02:50:07.240]  because videos are nowhere nearly as long as podcasts.
[02:50:07.240 --> 02:50:10.300]  And I don't wanna spend a lot of your time on the sponsor.
[02:50:10.300 --> 02:50:12.300]  So I try to get in and out and make it relevant
[02:50:12.300 --> 02:50:13.140]  to the video.
[02:50:13.140 --> 02:50:16.060]  But it is, the podcasts are the anti, or not podcasts,
[02:50:16.060 --> 02:50:18.340]  YouTube videos are the anti-podcasts where,
[02:50:18.340 --> 02:50:20.020]  here we are approaching hour three,
[02:50:20.020 --> 02:50:21.760]  or do we just cross hour three?
[02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:25.140]  And your videos are,
[02:50:26.700 --> 02:50:28.740]  sorry that the video is seven minutes long,
[02:50:28.740 --> 02:50:30.820]  I didn't have enough time to make it six minutes.
[02:50:30.820 --> 02:50:32.300]  It's like that Mark Twain line
[02:50:32.300 --> 02:50:35.860]  about writing a long letter.
[02:50:35.860 --> 02:50:36.700]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[02:50:36.700 --> 02:50:38.980]  It just takes more work to make the point in six minutes,
[02:50:38.980 --> 02:50:42.620]  but it's even better if you do, and that includes it.
[02:50:42.620 --> 02:50:44.100]  Yeah, I told you this before.
[02:50:44.100 --> 02:50:46.220]  It's one of my favorite stories in recent years
[02:50:46.220 --> 02:50:50.460]  in terms of the way that little kids minds think is that,
[02:50:50.460 --> 02:50:52.080]  and it stuck with me,
[02:50:52.080 --> 02:50:54.120]  is that somebody on Twitter was blown away.
[02:50:54.120 --> 02:50:56.660]  Somebody like our age had a little girl
[02:50:56.660 --> 02:51:01.660]  and her and her friends all call advertisements skip ads.
[02:51:01.780 --> 02:51:02.620]  Yeah.
[02:51:02.620 --> 02:51:04.900]  And that's all ads,
[02:51:04.900 --> 02:51:07.100]  whether they actually are like YouTube ads
[02:51:07.100 --> 02:51:10.360]  with a skip ad button, they just call them skip ads.
[02:51:10.360 --> 02:51:13.200]  Cause that's what the label says, skip ad.
[02:51:14.540 --> 02:51:16.100]  And it really,
[02:51:16.100 --> 02:51:18.740]  but it also clearly shows their mentality of them
[02:51:18.740 --> 02:51:21.340]  that these are things you skip,
[02:51:21.340 --> 02:51:26.140]  which is not conducive to continuing to have them.
[02:51:26.140 --> 02:51:27.300]  Absolutely.
[02:51:27.300 --> 02:51:28.620]  Anyway, keep up the good work.
[02:51:28.620 --> 02:51:30.220]  I really, it's great. Thank you so much.
[02:51:30.220 --> 02:51:32.820]  And it's been a very,
[02:51:32.820 --> 02:51:34.860]  and I can only assume you're going strong.
[02:51:34.860 --> 02:51:36.520]  It's not like you're in it for a year,
[02:51:36.520 --> 02:51:39.820]  but you're more invested in it than ever, right?
[02:51:39.820 --> 02:51:42.780]  Yeah. And I might end up being totally terrible at it.
[02:51:42.780 --> 02:51:45.180]  We'll see, but so far, I'm just going to keep working at it.
[02:51:45.180 --> 02:51:47.760]  Yeah. Well, it shows and I really enjoy it.
[02:51:48.920 --> 02:51:50.660]  Everybody else, you can read the rest of Renee's work,
[02:51:50.660 --> 02:51:52.640]  of course, at iMore.com
[02:51:52.640 --> 02:51:55.660]  and he's at Renee Ritchie on Twitter.
[02:51:55.660 --> 02:51:58.500]  And then the YouTube channel is Vector.
[02:51:58.500 --> 02:52:01.460]  You can just probably just go to YouTube and search for it.
[02:52:03.460 --> 02:52:05.620]  My thanks to our sponsors this week.
[02:52:05.620 --> 02:52:07.020]  Let's see if I can do it off the top of my head.
[02:52:07.020 --> 02:52:12.020]  We have Squarespace, where you can go to build a website.
[02:52:12.340 --> 02:52:13.180]  Fracture.
[02:52:13.180 --> 02:52:15.100]  Fracture, of course, where you can go to print your pictures
[02:52:15.100 --> 02:52:16.000]  and then our new sponsor,
[02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:19.100]  first time sponsor of the show, Marine Layer,
[02:52:19.100 --> 02:52:22.540]  where you can go to get super, super soft t-shirts
[02:52:22.540 --> 02:52:24.860]  and sweatshirts made out of trees.
[02:52:24.860 --> 02:52:37.860]  My thanks to them. Thanks, Renee.
