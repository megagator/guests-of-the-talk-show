[00:00.000 --> 00:04.640]  We've got rumors to talk about. I love rumors. I know this is you know what I was thinking about
[00:04.640 --> 00:10.020]  I think this is sort of like I think this is the the the the fall season here the hot
[00:10.020 --> 00:12.180]  You know November, December. This is like peak
[00:12.840 --> 00:14.840]  rumor season because
[00:14.840 --> 00:16.840]  Nothing's coming out soon
[00:17.440 --> 00:20.960]  But there are you know Apple must be working on stuff for next year and beyond
[00:21.800 --> 00:24.360]  And so now is the time when the rumors start coming out
[00:24.360 --> 00:29.000]  The big one that I've seen the one that's got everybody in a tizzy is
[00:30.480 --> 00:35.480]  You know which one it is, right? Yes, I do which one is it? It's the the headphone jack thing
[00:36.280 --> 00:38.280]  Exactly right
[00:38.840 --> 00:40.840]  Very bad
[00:40.840 --> 00:48.920]  That the was a mini is mini jack, right? Yeah, so the standard 3.5 millimeter headphone jack that's been in every
[00:49.480 --> 00:51.480]  device that I'm aware of
[00:51.480 --> 00:53.480]  For a long time
[00:54.040 --> 00:56.040]  Is supposedly says one report
[00:59.800 --> 01:06.120]  Who had it originally here, let's see it was a Japanese rumor site, right? It's some chat or well not a rumor site, but
[01:06.640 --> 01:09.920]  Well, yeah, yeah, I'm excited for public so Mac rumors
[01:11.680 --> 01:13.680]  Right, it's
[01:13.880 --> 01:15.880]  Mac Oda Cara
[01:15.880 --> 01:20.400]  Which Mac rumors described as often reliable
[01:22.640 --> 01:29.120]  Often well in the scheme of like publishing these things from the supply chain in Asia
[01:29.120 --> 01:34.640]  Often reliable if you say it with a straight face is actually high praise high praise, right?
[01:36.440 --> 01:38.440]  But it was it it was not
[01:38.920 --> 01:40.520]  sourced from
[01:40.520 --> 01:42.160]  Digitimes, right?
[01:42.160 --> 01:50.000]  No, it's there they're so they didn't get it from Digitimes. No, they're report cited a quote reliable source. Okay, and
[01:52.800 --> 01:55.240]  I guess so it says here's here's Mac rumors
[01:56.400 --> 02:03.800]  Translation of it or interpretation. I guess I should say the report citing a quote reliable source and quote claims the news
[02:03.800 --> 02:08.960]  Same-sized lightning connector will support lightning equipped and Bluetooth headphones and have a
[02:08.960 --> 02:15.800]  DAC or a digital to audio converter for backwards compatibility with wired
[02:17.920 --> 02:23.400]  Headphones using a standard 3.5 millimeter stereo jack a
[02:24.720 --> 02:28.280]  3.5 millimeter to lightning adapter would be required
[02:31.000 --> 02:34.840]  So they I guess the gist of it the way I interpret this and I don't think it's entirely clear
[02:34.840 --> 02:40.280]  The way I just interpret it is that they're not replacing the headphone jack with a new
[02:40.840 --> 02:41.640]  proprietary jack
[02:41.640 --> 02:46.480]  They are simply getting rid of the headphone jack and you'll just have to plug in to the lightning
[02:47.120 --> 02:49.800]  adapter that's already there or use Bluetooth
[02:52.400 --> 02:58.600]  Or use Bluetooth, but I don't see why this report says that the new lightning connector has anything to do with
[03:00.000 --> 03:01.040]  Bluetooth though
[03:01.040 --> 03:06.840]  Doesn't seem like that. No, I think that's a mistake. That's what I mean about it being a little confusing
[03:06.840 --> 03:13.320]  I think what they mean is that you you know your options will be to either plug in headphones with a lightning connector a
[03:15.080 --> 03:21.360]  Be use a new dongle that doesn't exist yet. That'll be a you'll stick it in the lightning port
[03:21.360 --> 03:28.400]  And then you'll stick regular headphones into this dongle or see you'll switch to Bluetooth headphones or
[03:28.400 --> 03:33.600]  Or D you'll throw your phone in the river and
[03:35.440 --> 03:37.440]  Go back to blackberry
[03:38.880 --> 03:40.880]  I guess the other option would be to
[03:41.440 --> 03:47.360]  This would be a great time for blackberry to come out and and proclaim their support for the the 3.5 millimeter
[03:51.200 --> 03:53.160]  Another option and I love it
[03:53.160 --> 03:59.720]  I really do. I deeply enjoy it when other people small children do this on let's say a train or something is you could just use the speakers
[04:03.640 --> 04:12.920]  That's perfect pumped up to allow enough volume to to you know over here overtake the sound of the train or the train or the jet airliner that you're riding
[04:15.960 --> 04:17.960]  Who needs headphones?
[04:17.960 --> 04:23.960]  No, so but the whole I mean the whole thing so this this is portrayed as which you know
[04:24.200 --> 04:27.000]  Well, first of all that that this is not the first time we've heard this
[04:27.960 --> 04:34.080]  No, it's rumor well, I think I think this this flow is floated also right before the the iPhone 6
[04:35.160 --> 04:37.160]  Remember correctly I
[04:37.160 --> 04:40.280]  Think it started it started though when lightning
[04:40.600 --> 04:44.760]  debuted because lightning has always supported audio like you can go and you can buy
[04:44.760 --> 04:51.080]  They exist today. In fact that Phillips. There's a pair of Phillips ones here in those screenshot that
[04:51.640 --> 04:55.320]  Mac rumors has you can buy lightning connector headphones today
[04:55.880 --> 05:00.120]  Like the existing lightning port can support audio so you can do that right now today
[05:00.120 --> 05:05.880]  That's not like a new thing. I think that what they're saying so in terms of what they're saying about the this
[05:06.360 --> 05:10.200]  Soap called iPhone 7 having a new like next generation lightning
[05:10.200 --> 05:15.000]  Jack, you know the female side
[05:15.800 --> 05:18.280]  Would be the that it includes a digital audio
[05:19.080 --> 05:24.200]  Converter. I don't know the why the dongle wouldn't do the digital audio conversion
[05:24.760 --> 05:29.480]  But anyway, that's what they're saying so I think right now. I so this is and I could be wrong
[05:29.480 --> 05:34.600]  I could be definitely wrong about this. This could be something that maybe the dongle would work on our existing iPhones
[05:34.600 --> 05:36.600]  but I think what they're saying is that
[05:36.600 --> 05:43.560]  To use standard headphones through the dongle and the lightning would require this iPhone 7 lightning
[05:44.200 --> 05:47.080]  Port because it would include the digital audio converter inside
[05:47.800 --> 05:50.200]  Okay, but otherwise. I don't think anything any of this is new
[05:51.000 --> 05:54.520]  You know the fact that lightning can handle audio is definitely not new
[05:54.520 --> 06:00.200]  You can buy these headphones today and use them on your phone today and the rumors started as soon as that became clear
[06:00.200 --> 06:07.400]  There's why else would they do it unless they plan to get rid of the 3.5 at some point. Yeah
[06:09.160 --> 06:13.480]  There was also there was a there's a also a smaller jack than the 3.5
[06:14.520 --> 06:17.320]  Melimeter jack that used to be used in Japan
[06:18.840 --> 06:21.800]  For years because I remember I bought when I was in Japan
[06:21.800 --> 06:24.120]  I accidentally bought a pair of headphones and took it on home and
[06:24.120 --> 06:32.200]  I was like I went to put them on my like my walk man or whatever it was. This is not this is not right
[06:33.080 --> 06:39.320]  but but I and but I think the reason the reason it was exactly that though was that was for smaller
[06:40.120 --> 06:42.120]  so the smaller devices
[06:42.600 --> 06:44.600]  There's so many jokes
[06:44.600 --> 06:58.200]  I can't think of any jokes stem from this no there could be there's nothing there's nothing to be said
[06:59.800 --> 07:04.840]  Anyway, people are some people are very very upset about this they they are
[07:05.720 --> 07:08.520]  and however much controversy there was
[07:08.520 --> 07:13.400]  When Apple switch from 30 the 30 pin dock connector to the lightning
[07:15.000 --> 07:21.640]  Adaptor and people accused Apple of you know doing this just to get people to buy more more caped
[07:21.640 --> 07:29.400]  You know every you know it was a money grab. This is the accusation that it was a money grab. I think you and I have talked about this multiple times that it was a money grab and
[07:31.720 --> 07:37.880]  They wanted to sell new cables. They wanted you to buy new docks. They wanted you to buy their little I think it was $19
[07:37.880 --> 07:45.160]  The little just the little adapter that lets you switch a 30 pin thing into a lightning thing. I think it was 19
[07:45.320 --> 07:49.560]  Wasn't that much or was that the headphone price? No. Yeah, that was no. That's probably right. That's probably right
[07:49.560 --> 07:53.800]  Although it may be it was 20 not headphones or something like 30 yeah
[07:57.240 --> 08:04.760]  And I laugh about this I laugh that people are upset and I but I understand the frustration, you know, I just laugh at how
[08:04.760 --> 08:14.440]  How hard people take this mm-hmm. Well. Yeah, so the the thing that it's portrayed as a trade-off for is is getting a thinner iPhone
[08:15.240 --> 08:21.880]  Right. Yeah, then that's the only so it's in everyone says. I don't want a thinner iPhone
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.000]  which I
[08:25.000 --> 08:31.160]  Mean I don't I don't feel like I need a thinner iPhone, but in fairness you haven't seen a thinner iPhone
[08:31.160 --> 08:34.840]  No, you might you might really like a thinner iPhone
[08:35.960 --> 08:38.440]  Well, and as oh man, here it is
[08:38.440 --> 08:44.520]  So I looked it up on the store dot Apple dot com the lightning to 30 pin adapter not a cable just the little adapter right now
[08:44.760 --> 08:49.080]  It sells for $29 so I think it's maybe it's always been $29. Yeah
[08:51.640 --> 08:53.640]  And the
[08:54.200 --> 08:57.960]  Lightning to 30 pin adapter that's more of a cable is
[08:57.960 --> 09:06.040]  $39 it's got a a 0.2 meter cable, so it's it's a rather
[09:06.760 --> 09:10.920]  20 centimeter cable, and that's that's $39
[09:15.160 --> 09:21.320]  So I do get the reservation there it does seem to me it seems very clear to me and
[09:21.880 --> 09:26.360]  And it does this seems funny that it always comes up when you're on the show that there's a sort of aspect of
[09:26.360 --> 09:29.000]  You know, let's spend Tim Cook's money
[09:30.120 --> 09:33.080]  You know that these things should be cheaper
[09:33.400 --> 09:38.360]  And that whatever money they make from them they would gain in good well
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.560]  By making them if not giving them away
[09:41.720 --> 09:48.920]  You know coming as close to giving them away as they can that if they sold them at cost and presumably it costs a lot less than
[09:49.080 --> 09:51.320]  $29 to make this dongle yeah
[09:52.520 --> 09:54.600]  It would they would make up for it in good will
[09:54.600 --> 09:56.600]  All right
[09:56.920 --> 09:58.920]  They're not interested they're not interested in that
[10:00.920 --> 10:04.520]  Well, I think it would be it would make that the pill easier just wallow it
[10:05.080 --> 10:07.960]  You know, I don't know that people would be completely
[10:08.920 --> 10:11.880]  As if you're if you're heavily invested in in that jack
[10:11.880 --> 10:16.360]  And I think you know, I mean, I think some people are I'm not I wouldn't say that I am particularly
[10:16.360 --> 10:18.360]  I do have many headphones
[10:18.360 --> 10:23.240]  that I wear with that jack, but I mostly use them for podcasting and
[10:24.360 --> 10:28.200]  And so I put I'm plugging them into a microphone instead of plugging it into my
[10:29.480 --> 10:31.480]  My iPhone
[10:31.480 --> 10:36.280]  And you and I mostly and I'm you know, I'm a I'm not an audio file
[10:36.280 --> 10:38.280]  So I mostly use
[10:38.280 --> 10:40.280]  Apple's headphones and
[10:40.280 --> 10:44.280]  When I'm using my iPhone and I and then I also have a pair of blue tooth
[10:44.280 --> 10:50.520]  headphones that I use for for exercising. Yeah, so it wouldn't really change my life that much
[10:51.160 --> 10:57.880]  It's a it's just I just find it a fun thing to talk about on the show because it is it
[10:58.520 --> 11:03.640]  It's such a petty little thing and the grand scheme of things if you really think about it, right?
[11:03.640 --> 11:08.360]  It's just not that big a deal in the life of a iPhone user
[11:08.920 --> 11:12.840]  But there's so many like implications of a change like this
[11:12.840 --> 11:16.360]  That it makes it fun to think about the trade-offs on Apple's part
[11:17.880 --> 11:20.440]  So let's tackle some more of these implications of the
[11:21.560 --> 11:22.840]  Audio jack
[11:22.840 --> 11:28.840]  So one of them like you said that the idea would be that that Apple would be motivated to do this
[11:29.560 --> 11:37.480]  Because it would allow them to make the device thinner that at this point 3.5 millimeters just for the port alone is
[11:37.480 --> 11:44.760]  Significant, you know, it's it's a constraint given the how the millimeter thickness of these devices
[11:45.160 --> 11:51.800]  Now that obviously there's existence proof that they can make thinner devices that still have that port like the the iPod touch
[11:51.800 --> 11:54.600]  The current generation iPod touch is like a full
[11:55.560 --> 11:57.960]  millimeter thinner than the iPhone
[11:58.680 --> 12:06.920]  Success is it really? Yeah, okay. I actually had I haven't even both here, but there are cases or almost so it's like it's like the
[12:06.920 --> 12:11.160]  iPhone 6s is like 6.9 millimeters and the iPod touch is like 6.1
[12:12.600 --> 12:14.600]  and still has a
[12:15.320 --> 12:17.320]  standard audio port and
[12:17.320 --> 12:19.160]  the
[12:19.160 --> 12:20.120]  iPod
[12:20.120 --> 12:24.200]  Nano is even thinner still and still has the
[12:25.160 --> 12:26.120]  the
[12:26.120 --> 12:28.120]  regular audio port
[12:28.840 --> 12:32.520]  But as some people on Twitter have pointed out like if you look at the iPod Nano
[12:32.520 --> 12:41.880]  The the full where you know the the length that takes the depth that the headphone jack has to go into the port to fit
[12:42.440 --> 12:45.640]  It doesn't actually go underneath the screen at all. There's like a chin
[12:46.200 --> 12:52.120]  You know, so it's not it's not like it also has to fit underneath the screen where I think it does on on the iPhone
[12:53.400 --> 12:55.880]  So thinness is definitely certainly one of the angles
[12:56.440 --> 13:00.280]  I don't think it means that they couldn't make an iPhone 7 that's thinner and keep
[13:00.280 --> 13:02.280]  The jack though
[13:02.280 --> 13:09.400]  It's just probably makes it easier because it's one lasting to put in and I think I think that the depth of the the jack is actually more
[13:09.400 --> 13:14.040]  of a problem than the thickness of it the fact that the standard audio port has to go so far in
[13:16.040 --> 13:17.800]  God this show could be torn apart
[13:19.880 --> 13:22.040]  To create a political attack out against me
[13:22.040 --> 13:24.040]  I
[13:29.160 --> 13:33.400]  Here's here's not like what what do you think would happen if they said we're taking out
[13:34.280 --> 13:38.440]  We're taking out the audio jack because we want to put more battery in
[13:39.960 --> 13:47.160]  That would be an interesting thing for them to say so we took out. Yeah, we took out the audio jack and you'll get another
[13:48.600 --> 13:50.600]  Hour-and-a-half of battery
[13:50.600 --> 13:56.520]  That would be interesting. It would be an interesting way to justify it instead of saying it's gonna be even thinner
[13:56.840 --> 14:03.480]  Right because saying that it's even thinner. It really only seems to satisfy Apple's internal obsession with
[14:04.040 --> 14:09.400]  Device thinness and it could well be that it's more than just the
[14:10.760 --> 14:16.840]  The taste of Johnny I've and his team and whoever else is there that they want these devices that they value thinness over
[14:16.840 --> 14:23.320]  The battery life that could be gained by just making the device thicker or keeping it the thinness of
[14:24.200 --> 14:29.400]  The instead of making it as thin as they possibly can to get the same battery life as the previous generation
[14:29.400 --> 14:33.000]  What if they kept the same thickness as the
[14:33.960 --> 14:35.960]  Device thickness is the previous generation
[14:36.040 --> 14:42.200]  But use their newfound ability to miniaturize and thin things to just create more room for a battery right?
[14:42.200 --> 14:49.960]  That's that's the that's the thing that some people a lot of people seem to want Apple to do. It could well be that Apple has internal marketing
[14:52.680 --> 14:57.640]  Like data like you know that that suggests if not proves that
[14:58.280 --> 15:05.800]  Given the choice in a store people will choose the thinner device and that there might be as much as many of us think that
[15:05.800 --> 15:13.160]  People would be happier with the thicker device that gets longer battery life Apple might have some knowledge to know that at
[15:13.160 --> 15:15.640]  The point of sale people are gonna buy the thinner one
[15:16.440 --> 15:19.320]  And I would expose them to it. I wouldn't be yeah
[15:19.400 --> 15:21.400]  I wouldn't be surprised by that really because
[15:22.040 --> 15:24.200]  I don't think it's like it's not like this for me anymore
[15:24.200 --> 15:29.000]  But that used to be the one thing when I looked at years ago when I looked at Android phones. I thought
[15:29.720 --> 15:34.440]  Wow, it would be really cool to have a phone. That was that then. Yeah, Sam song has one you know
[15:34.440 --> 15:38.920]  It's one of the galaxies. It's not the flagship because the flagship one has higher specs and
[15:39.480 --> 15:45.880]  Can't be that then but there's one of the current galaxy phones somebody I saw somebody claim is only 5.9 millimeters
[15:46.280 --> 15:54.360]  So Samsung's you know in a race for a thinness too and it don't forget that these are the sort of decisions that when Apple makes now for next year
[15:55.640 --> 15:59.240]  If they stick to the current plan of using the same hardware for two years
[15:59.240 --> 16:05.640]  You know basic hardware profile for two years with a seven next year and in a seven s the year after that
[16:06.280 --> 16:07.800]  um
[16:07.800 --> 16:10.840]  That if they make a mistake here and go thicker and
[16:11.320 --> 16:14.920]  Samsung goes way thinner and it proves to be a hit
[16:14.920 --> 16:21.680]  They could be the same sort of thing that happened with larger screen sizes a few years ago where larger screen sizes clearly were
[16:22.040 --> 16:24.040]  selling phones and
[16:24.040 --> 16:29.000]  You know there was even we've at is one of those rare things that we have proof of because it it
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  came out in
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.520]  The court case one of the court cases with Samsung where there was like an email
[16:34.520 --> 16:36.760]  I think might have even been from Shiller himself
[16:36.760 --> 16:41.240]  But it was certainly from somebody on Shiller's team. There was an internal email at Apple that said
[16:41.960 --> 16:42.760]  um
[16:42.760 --> 16:46.840]  People some people want what we don't have larger screen phones
[16:48.520 --> 16:51.080]  and they can't just scramble and
[16:51.080 --> 16:58.600]  You know come out with a new phone next month with a bigger screen these things are you know have two-year lead times
[16:59.400 --> 17:01.400]  maybe even longer
[17:02.360 --> 17:07.880]  So if Apple's you know, thanks or it may be even knows that then this sells and that and they certainly know that
[17:07.960 --> 17:09.240]  Samsung has
[17:09.240 --> 17:12.760]  Capable of making devices that are thin if not other you know companies too
[17:13.240 --> 17:15.240]  They may not want to you know
[17:15.320 --> 17:20.920]  They may not want to do this even if they also know that customer satisfaction wise after they've
[17:20.920 --> 17:26.200]  Already purchased a phone if it had the longer battery life of a thicker thing people would be happier
[17:28.120 --> 17:30.440]  Yeah, it's it is strange though to see
[17:31.560 --> 17:33.560]  lots of people saying
[17:35.240 --> 17:37.080]  That they don't want something that you know
[17:37.080 --> 17:39.080]  I mean I obviously this is presented as
[17:39.400 --> 17:43.320]  You know you got to get rid of this in order to get that if they came out and just said it was going to be a thinner phone
[17:43.400 --> 17:47.720]  You'd probably get a slightly different reaction without the near you to lose the headphone jack
[17:47.720 --> 17:49.720]  but
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.880]  It seems like it used to be like here are the things that you know
[17:54.360 --> 17:57.000]  Seems like they might be coming in the next iPhone and everyone would be
[17:58.120 --> 18:01.160]  Pretty excited about those things with the exceptional lighting. Yeah
[18:02.360 --> 18:06.040]  And I feel like like I feel like I don't I don't necessarily
[18:06.120 --> 18:09.480]  I don't feel like I'm that excited about a thinner phone at this point and
[18:10.120 --> 18:13.800]  I you know, we've had this discussion before too. I would rather have a smaller phone
[18:13.800 --> 18:19.400]  Yeah, it may not just be about thinness though. I let so I think I say it could be it could help and
[18:19.560 --> 18:21.400]  And maybe it would help with battery life too
[18:21.480 --> 18:27.000]  But there are other factors too like even if you could just keep this just concede for the moment that they could go
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.680]  As thin as they want to and still keep the other jack that whatever thinness
[18:30.680 --> 18:36.520]  They're they're planning for for the iPhone 7 it could accommodate a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
[18:36.520 --> 18:39.240]  Yeah, I don't know if that's true now, but let's just concede it for the moment
[18:39.720 --> 18:41.720]  it's also another point of
[18:41.720 --> 18:44.280]  You know potential water damage
[18:45.080 --> 18:48.840]  It's an you know one last port is one lunch one last thing to
[18:51.160 --> 18:55.240]  To have to you know try to protect against you know water getting in there
[18:56.920 --> 19:04.040]  Having two ports definitely takes more space inside the device than one port that does both things
[19:04.200 --> 19:08.280]  I mean, that's just I mean that's just like a obvious fact
[19:08.280 --> 19:11.560]  So in other ways other than thinness it might you know
[19:11.560 --> 19:16.200]  Like you said batteries one life who knows what else they could use that space for but they could certainly you know
[19:16.200 --> 19:19.720]  They certainly take advantage of every bit of space that they can yeah
[19:21.480 --> 19:23.480]  I
[19:24.280 --> 19:27.720]  Don't know the problem is like she is charging. I mean everybody's you know
[19:27.720 --> 19:30.440]  Rise out already, but like when you're and I do this
[19:30.440 --> 19:35.720]  I do this sometimes where I put the headphones in and charging was that my desk and listening to something and
[19:35.720 --> 19:37.720]  I
[19:39.080 --> 19:41.080]  Having to like find a dongle and
[19:41.800 --> 19:46.680]  Yeah, that's nobody wants nobody really wants a dongle like a wire adapter dongle
[19:47.240 --> 19:53.160]  Right, yeah, the idea would be that even even if you're on board like on the one hand if you want to stick with your
[19:54.040 --> 19:58.600]  beloved old pair of headphones that has a 3.5 millimeter jack
[19:59.480 --> 20:02.520]  Then you need a dongle, you know to go 3.5 to
[20:02.520 --> 20:12.360]  Lightning and it's can't be a tiny little dongle because we know how long the adapter is on the headphones and
[20:15.000 --> 20:21.520]  Like I'm looking at it right now. Yeah, that's you know at a minimum like it's you know at least what half an inch
[20:23.240 --> 20:30.760]  Not that small so you got this things sticking out of your phone plus the actual cable itself from the headphone that sticks out from the phone
[20:30.760 --> 20:32.760]  So it's you know
[20:32.760 --> 20:36.680]  Comperson, but even if you're willing to go on board with the
[20:37.320 --> 20:42.680]  New pair of lightning headphones which presumably Apple would ship with the device and other you know companies are already making
[20:43.080 --> 20:45.320]  If you want to charge and use those at the same times
[20:45.320 --> 20:49.880]  You'd still need an adapter so that you could have two lightning inputs one for charging one for the headphone
[20:50.920 --> 20:57.960]  And I'm not even sure if that would work. Yeah, unless you have a inductive charging, right and I
[20:57.960 --> 21:02.760]  I fully concede like one of the things this is just one of those things where I just I'll just
[21:02.760 --> 21:05.720]  I just like to sit here and think about it from Apple's perspective
[21:05.720 --> 21:09.000]  And I don't really have strong feelings one way or the other like me
[21:09.480 --> 21:14.680]  Trying to justify it and thinking of the reasons Apple might want to do it isn't me saying. I think this is a great idea
[21:17.160 --> 21:23.000]  I'm not sure I think it's interesting because there's so many trade-offs, but the the needing to charge or wanting to charge
[21:23.000 --> 21:27.880]  While you listen with headphones is absolutely positively a real thing. I see my son doing it all the time
[21:28.360 --> 21:30.840]  His device devices seem to all live
[21:31.640 --> 21:35.480]  In in the like the best charge. I ever seemed to get put them in the yellow
[21:38.360 --> 21:40.360]  Yeah, I think Hank is I guess similar
[21:41.720 --> 21:47.240]  I mean so even just since this rumor popped up. I've spotted Jonas at least twice
[21:47.240 --> 21:54.520]  Using his I think it was both times it was his iPad, but using his iPad with headphones watching video while it was charging
[21:54.920 --> 21:58.600]  So I fully concede that is not just something people want to do
[21:59.880 --> 22:04.320]  It's something people like my son would have to do other than to stare at a black
[22:05.320 --> 22:09.560]  Let it go out. Yeah, just stare at the black screen of a dead. I I've had
[22:10.520 --> 22:12.440]  So I don't know how Apple solves it
[22:12.440 --> 22:17.960]  Maybe the answer is of course that they don't and that this whole story is bullshit and they're not getting rid of the separate
[22:17.960 --> 22:19.720]  Jack well, that's the and that's the other thing
[22:19.720 --> 22:24.520]  That's kind of ridiculous about this the whole thing because it's it has really been widely
[22:25.160 --> 22:26.760]  discussed and
[22:27.160 --> 22:29.160]  It is all based off this one right
[22:29.880 --> 22:37.400]  This one source like so inside Apple. There's somebody you know some team that clearly already knows the answer to this
[22:37.560 --> 22:40.600]  I think that this is one of those decisions that's already been made
[22:40.600 --> 22:42.600]  and they're either
[22:42.840 --> 22:44.840]  They're laughing one way or the other
[22:46.360 --> 22:51.960]  Either way they're laughing like if there is an iPhone if there is a regular
[22:52.520 --> 22:56.280]  Good old-fashioned 3.5 millimeter headphone jack on the iPhone 7 next year
[22:56.360 --> 23:01.680]  The team inside Apple is laughing at all of the thought that we're all putting into this and all the
[23:01.960 --> 23:06.520]  consternation out there on the web and if there's not there they're at least chuckling at the
[23:06.520 --> 23:10.520]  People who are saying there's no way they would do this. It would make everybody too furious
[23:13.880 --> 23:15.880]  The other
[23:15.880 --> 23:17.880]  There's a stranger in a controversy
[23:17.880 --> 23:24.920]  So I don't think it's funny though because it is clearly controversial and it's like there's something about Apple that makes them
[23:25.640 --> 23:31.160]  You know one of the ways that Apple is clearly different than other companies is there the only company whoever seems to face these things
[23:31.880 --> 23:33.880]  I never see
[23:33.880 --> 23:36.920]  For one thing the other companies tend to keep
[23:37.560 --> 23:39.400]  Legacy ports around
[23:39.400 --> 23:43.320]  Almost as long as they can as opposed to looking for a way to get rid of legacy ports
[23:43.320 --> 23:45.960]  They look for a way to keep them going as long as they can
[23:46.680 --> 23:51.480]  Yeah, it's like they don't want to lose that one extra sale and and then even when they do
[23:52.360 --> 23:57.960]  I don't know how they escape the criticism like Android phones like iPhones have gone from
[23:59.640 --> 24:03.000]  And if you for the sake of an argument if you just count the I
[24:03.000 --> 24:08.120]  Pod as like a like a sibling predecessor to the iPhone
[24:08.600 --> 24:10.600]  they've gone through two ports
[24:11.160 --> 24:13.160]  Ever 30 pin
[24:13.160 --> 24:15.160]  Starting with the original iPod to
[24:15.960 --> 24:22.280]  Nope the first the first one had fireware right so it was the same on the fire on the 30 pin end
[24:22.600 --> 24:26.600]  But it was all only firewire any other but we'll call it you know you need it in a new cable
[24:26.600 --> 24:32.760]  So we'll call that the same wait wait no, it was a no the original iPod was firewire
[24:32.760 --> 24:37.640]  On both ends. Oh my god. You're right. Yeah. You're you're right. Yeah. I'm totally wrong on that
[24:38.120 --> 24:39.400]  So there are all right
[24:39.400 --> 24:41.720]  So here's the changes they've gone through from including all the
[24:42.200 --> 24:44.920]  iPods one the first one was firewire firewire
[24:45.640 --> 24:47.640]  Then they went 30 pin to firewire
[24:48.440 --> 24:50.440]  And then it was 30 pin to USB
[24:51.320 --> 24:57.160]  But if you just made like a clock radio that had the 30 pin thing it would work with whatever your your iPod was
[24:57.800 --> 24:59.000]  And then lightning
[24:59.000 --> 25:03.320]  Uh other devices that ones that just use like USB went through
[25:03.320 --> 25:04.600]  I forget the names of them
[25:04.600 --> 25:07.400]  But there's like sort of the the thicker mini
[25:07.960 --> 25:09.160]  USB
[25:09.160 --> 25:14.600]  Then there's the thinner new micro USB. It was like there was like mini USB micro USB
[25:15.160 --> 25:20.760]  And now USB C which is nice because it's like lightning and you can you can't put it in upside down
[25:20.760 --> 25:26.440]  It works both directions for some reason when they switch they don't get they don't get the controversy. Yeah
[25:26.440 --> 25:33.320]  Yeah, that always used to make me laugh because people in the Android side would make fun of Apple for for like oh your your ports
[25:33.320 --> 25:35.640]  They're your ports mesh and it's like yeah
[25:36.200 --> 25:37.880]  other years
[25:38.120 --> 25:41.320]  And it's like I I know some people are saying
[25:41.960 --> 25:46.760]  We'll say well no, but Apple's the only one who tries to gouge you for $29 for an adapter
[25:47.480 --> 25:48.440]  um
[25:48.680 --> 25:53.640]  But you know in short order you can go to you know Amazon or
[25:53.640 --> 25:55.080]  uh
[25:55.080 --> 26:00.840]  Monoprice for example and get a high quality adapter that's not made by Apple for a reasonable price
[26:01.480 --> 26:06.760]  So I mean you can make the transition and that's there was the only places that people on Android
[26:07.160 --> 26:09.160]  Bicables and stuff like that
[26:09.400 --> 26:14.120]  Yeah, so the fact that Apple's first party adapters and dongles are seemingly
[26:14.440 --> 26:16.440]  Exorbitantly priced
[26:16.440 --> 26:20.760]  It doesn't really make things worse for anybody who's sensitive to that and just he goes to Amazon
[26:20.760 --> 26:24.040]  I mean it's not like Amazon is some obscure company that nobody's heard of
[26:28.360 --> 26:29.320]  It's it
[26:30.120 --> 26:32.680]  It might be slightly cheaper to get USB adapters
[26:33.320 --> 26:37.880]  My because because the other ones I mean the other ones somebody has to license from Apple right
[26:37.880 --> 26:44.040]  If the license one end from Apple right, but there's other there's other still did it still gets down to the point where it's okay
[26:44.040 --> 26:48.200]  You know, we're still talking about like ten books. There's other hassles involved though like that
[26:48.200 --> 26:52.760]  I've and they're all reasonable. I mean these are all reasonable complaints. They're actual truth, you know
[26:52.760 --> 26:55.880]  The actual truth they're obvious, but like the problem where
[26:57.640 --> 27:00.040]  Like in a two-person household
[27:01.160 --> 27:02.200]  where
[27:02.200 --> 27:04.200]  person a
[27:04.520 --> 27:10.600]  Has or at one point they both you both have phones with the same port on it and in one of you upgrades to a new one
[27:10.600 --> 27:17.560]  And it has a different port and now all the various places like in that kitchen or wherever you might share a little charging station
[27:17.560 --> 27:23.400]  And now you can't just use the same cable and you've got to either have two of them everywhere or you know
[27:23.400 --> 27:29.000]  Divide up the territory 5050. Yeah, doesn't matter whether it's lightning and 30 pin or USB
[27:29.800 --> 27:34.840]  Micro USB and USB C. It's the same problem, but somehow this only becomes like a public
[27:38.440 --> 27:40.840]  Bruhaha without it. I don't get that
[27:40.840 --> 27:46.040]  I don't get it either. I guess it's because
[27:48.680 --> 27:52.680]  I don't know. I mean, I guess you you could feasibly have a choice if you're on Android
[27:52.680 --> 27:56.280]  You could have a choice to go to a phone that has like the connector that you like
[27:57.080 --> 28:00.280]  Which seems like an awful way to make a decision to buy how to buy a phone
[28:01.720 --> 28:04.200]  I really like mini USB
[28:05.240 --> 28:07.640]  And I'm gonna buy whatever phone as many USB jack
[28:07.640 --> 28:12.120]  All right, let me take you're not try to sell me micro USB
[28:13.720 --> 28:18.440]  Let me take a break here and tell you about a very special friend of the show
[28:19.400 --> 28:21.400]  Our first advertiser. It's Wealthfront
[28:22.920 --> 28:28.360]  It's a low-cost automated investment service and it makes you easy to invest your money the right way
[28:28.360 --> 28:36.760]  You give Wealthfront your money and they invested for you. They sort of did they have this algorithm that they use
[28:37.560 --> 28:40.400]  And you can adjust your risk of vercity
[28:41.400 --> 28:45.960]  So you could be a little bit more aggressive knowing that it might be a little bit more likely that you lose money
[28:46.040 --> 28:47.880]  Or you can be a little bit more conservative
[28:47.880 --> 28:50.920]  They have a quick little profile thing when you first sign up
[28:52.120 --> 28:57.000]  to sort of set that in place and then once you start going with it
[28:57.000 --> 28:59.000]  They just automatically
[29:00.520 --> 29:02.520]  Buy and sell various
[29:02.840 --> 29:09.960]  Index funds to keep your total investment balanced. So when one sector of the stock market goes up
[29:11.400 --> 29:19.720]  And another sector goes down. They adjusted accordingly based on all sorts of complicated academically proven things that I don't understand
[29:19.880 --> 29:23.080]  But more or less if you think about having a personal finance manager
[29:23.080 --> 29:29.800]  A person who you would just go to and give your money to and then trust them to invest it
[29:29.800 --> 29:34.120]  This is an automated service that replaces that now. What are the advantages to this?
[29:35.400 --> 29:39.880]  One of them is that with regular personal financial advisors you get charged
[29:40.520 --> 29:42.520]  1% on every transaction
[29:43.960 --> 29:49.560]  Some of them it's up to 3% and they they charge that on everything that you have under management
[29:49.560 --> 29:54.520]  So every dollar you put in they charge that fee wealth front only charges
[29:54.920 --> 29:56.840]  0.25%
[29:57.560 --> 29:59.560]  Of what you have invested and
[30:00.360 --> 30:02.680]  They only start charging that over
[30:03.640 --> 30:08.760]  $10,000 invested so under $10,000 invested they don't charge anything
[30:09.240 --> 30:13.880]  But they even have a special deal for listeners of the show use the code. I'm going to give you the in here
[30:15.000 --> 30:17.240]  And it goes up to $15,000
[30:17.240 --> 30:21.400]  So your first $15,000 that you put in with these guys
[30:22.200 --> 30:24.040]  Is all
[30:24.040 --> 30:28.120]  No fee and then they only start charging that 0.25%
[30:28.680 --> 30:30.840]  Fee on what you have over
[30:31.640 --> 30:33.640]  $15,000
[30:34.280 --> 30:38.600]  It's a five hundred dollar minimum investment. So what they've told me is that
[30:39.640 --> 30:44.280]  A lot of people start out like that. They'll just put $500 and just to see how it works
[30:44.280 --> 30:47.880]  And then they only put quote-unquote real money in after they see it
[30:48.920 --> 30:52.760]  And they're perfectly welcome to do that and if you use the code you can start like that right away
[30:53.000 --> 30:56.040]  They've got all sorts of other things just go there and read it and they'll tell you about it
[30:56.040 --> 31:00.680]  But sophisticated investment strategies like tasks tax lost harvesting
[31:01.640 --> 31:05.560]  Which is a way to just optimize automatically not just once a year
[31:05.560 --> 31:13.880]  But like as you go how to maximize your profits your returns the size of your investment while minimizing your tax bill
[31:14.920 --> 31:16.920]  All sorts of great stuff like that

[31:20.840 --> 31:23.720]  I said that last time this bunch of the show I said I was going to check them out
[31:23.720 --> 31:27.400]  I'm actually very interested it turns out I can't I can't actually
[31:28.760 --> 31:30.840]  I can't use them as a customer because
[31:30.840 --> 31:36.280]  SCC rules would prevent me then from saying good things about them while they're paying me
[31:37.000 --> 31:41.160]  It's all very complicated, but we're doing this on the up and up and I really really
[31:42.360 --> 31:44.360]  Want to stay out of prison, so
[31:45.160 --> 31:50.840]  I'm not going to do it. I'm just telling you flat out. No, I am not a customer of Wealthfront
[31:51.640 --> 31:55.080]  Because if I were then I'd be in I'd be in legal trouble
[31:55.400 --> 31:59.240]  But it really does look very interesting to me. It looks like something that I would want to check out
[31:59.240 --> 32:03.800]  I have to read this to after read this verbatim for compliance purposes

[32:52.120 --> 32:54.120]  I
[32:54.600 --> 32:57.640]  Get nervous I get nervous with the sponsor where I feel like I might get legal
[32:58.360 --> 33:00.360]  You know what I mean like a
[33:00.360 --> 33:05.800]  If I tend up in the in the clink. Yeah, if I tell you something's not true about Casper mattresses, you know
[33:05.800 --> 33:07.800]  I mean like it's
[33:07.800 --> 33:11.960]  I mean there's always the stories about cutting those tags off the mattresses, but that's not even true
[33:12.360 --> 33:14.360]  It's only for like retailers
[33:14.680 --> 33:20.760]  And it seems that you know like you know sometimes has podcasts hosts we get free stuff from the yes
[33:20.760 --> 33:24.840]  Yeah, and it seems like Wealthfront would be a great person place to get free stuff
[33:26.280 --> 33:29.960]  And they can't give me a last a last they cannot give you any free
[33:30.680 --> 33:34.440]  That's a real drag. Yeah. Yeah, really is sort of an interesting thing
[33:34.440 --> 33:37.720]  But I the idea would be that they don't want to you know
[33:37.720 --> 33:43.320]  The rules aren't placed for good reason because they don't want to it can't have a thing where they're like paying somebody to go on a show and say
[33:43.800 --> 33:49.240]  You know that I put all my money in Wealthfront and it went up and that means it's always gonna go up, you know
[33:49.240 --> 33:51.720]  Right, they they can't have that
[33:53.000 --> 33:55.960]  Let's go back to the if we go back to the audio port thing
[33:55.960 --> 34:00.960]  I want to just say this that's the idea of let's just say in theory that Apple could either
[34:01.160 --> 34:08.760]  Like went let's just say for like a month after the new iPhone 7 comes out and it doesn't have the headphone jack if they just have like a fishbowl
[34:09.880 --> 34:13.720]  in the Apple store where you can go in and you end and
[34:14.520 --> 34:15.960]  And just say hey, I need it
[34:15.960 --> 34:19.800]  I need one another one of those adapters and Apple, you know, they just give you one
[34:20.040 --> 34:24.680]  You know, not not only would you get one for free with your iPhone that you could just go to the Apple store
[34:24.680 --> 34:30.040]  And if you want like two or three of them, they'll just give you like, you know a reasonable number of them and then after that
[34:30.600 --> 34:35.400]  Like like after you know the holiday seasons over or something like that
[34:35.400 --> 34:38.440]  They just settle in and sell them for let's say I mean
[34:38.440 --> 34:41.480]  I think the cheapest they could possibly sell them for is let's say 995
[34:41.480 --> 34:45.480]  I doesn't seem to me like they would sell them for us, but that's pretty cheap
[34:46.520 --> 34:49.400]  Why don't they do that? Why don't they just give them away like candy?
[34:51.800 --> 34:53.800]  You got me I think
[34:54.280 --> 35:01.960]  Well, there's two there's two explanations one is the cynical one which is that they really do purposefully sell them for an
[35:01.960 --> 35:03.960]  Exorbitant price because they want the money
[35:05.480 --> 35:09.800]  And and and the two my two explanations aren't necessarily at odds with each other
[35:09.800 --> 35:13.160]  There could be different groups within the company that agree with both of them
[35:13.560 --> 35:15.720]  So there could be like a Tim Cook
[35:16.360 --> 35:24.760]  Bean counter side a Jeff Williams operation side that says if we can sell these for $29 that would be great because we can make them for three dollars
[35:25.400 --> 35:30.840]  The other side the product marketing side might be sort of a
[35:31.960 --> 35:36.680]  If we don't make it painful sufficiently painful
[35:36.680 --> 35:38.680]  To make this transition
[35:39.640 --> 35:46.440]  Even knowing that that that there's a cost to our image because people will see us as money grubbing and
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.240]  Purposefully making annoying port decisions on the iPhone every year
[35:52.040 --> 35:57.320]  But if we don't do this if it's not sufficiently painful it won't motivate people to move to the new thing
[35:57.880 --> 35:58.680]  Yeah
[35:58.680 --> 36:03.800]  Because and think about it with just the fact that there already are lightning
[36:03.800 --> 36:08.200]  Headphones out there, but it's as far as I can tell very few people use them
[36:09.320 --> 36:14.200]  And there aren't as many as I guess apple would like I'm assuming they're more expensive
[36:15.480 --> 36:18.680]  They haven't liked yeah, and I guess they have to be licensed. I don't know
[36:19.640 --> 36:21.640]  Yeah, they would have to be right
[36:23.880 --> 36:25.880]  I
[36:25.880 --> 36:27.880]  Well the thing I mean the only thing that's a
[36:27.880 --> 36:34.040]  I think that's certainly probably true in the switch from 30-pin to lightning
[36:35.240 --> 36:38.920]  Because I think lightning was just it's just really a legitimately a better
[36:40.280 --> 36:42.280]  experience
[36:42.280 --> 36:44.280]  The the only thing that is kind of a
[36:45.240 --> 36:47.720]  Obviously some of this is because we don't really know the whole story
[36:48.440 --> 36:53.560]  Even if it's happening, but like it late but the charging situation is not really a better situation
[36:53.560 --> 36:57.080]  Situation right that is not a better experience
[37:00.200 --> 37:05.080]  Yeah, so I guess the other question to ask is what would make this configuration better
[37:05.400 --> 37:11.080]  Because I really do think apple would only this is only going to happen if apple thinks that overall this is better in some way
[37:11.640 --> 37:12.520]  Yeah
[37:12.520 --> 37:16.600]  And I don't I don't not quite sure I see it especially with the charging and
[37:17.560 --> 37:19.560]  Listening at the same time angle
[37:19.560 --> 37:27.560]  We may or may not have just spent the first hour of the show talking about something that's not happening that I don't even think is going to happen
[37:27.640 --> 37:32.360]  But I just think that it could because it just sounds like something apple would do
[37:32.360 --> 37:36.760]  Which is more or less what I said when I blogged about it that I just I just thought it just sounds like so happily
[37:36.760 --> 37:43.320]  Like we're gonna get rid of this thing that it seems absurd to get rid of and knowing that it's gonna make
[37:43.720 --> 37:47.400]  Some people very angry and make everybody else at least mildly annoyed
[37:47.400 --> 37:49.400]  Yeah
[37:49.800 --> 37:53.240]  Well, they've been doing it for you know, they've been doing it since the eye Mac, right? Yeah
[37:53.240 --> 37:57.800]  The other the other whole angle on this and I've seen tons of people on Twitter
[37:57.800 --> 38:01.800]  We absolutely have to mention it can't go on without doing it would be that
[38:02.360 --> 38:11.160]  The idea that maybe apple expects people to switch to wireless headphones and that maybe even the default ones that will ship with the iPhone will be
[38:11.160 --> 38:13.160]  wireless and that yes the
[38:13.160 --> 38:17.480]  You know if you want to use your old headphones
[38:17.880 --> 38:21.240]  You can do it with the dongle if you want to get a new pair of lightning headphones
[38:21.240 --> 38:25.080]  You can do it without a dongle, but that the default experience will switch from
[38:25.720 --> 38:28.280]  You know connected headphones to wireless headphones
[38:30.200 --> 38:35.560]  And they would they would have to they would have to ship Bluetooth headphones with every with every by phone
[38:35.880 --> 38:37.400]  iPhone
[38:37.400 --> 38:43.720]  Possible I mean it certainly pose would be more expensive my experience with wireless headphones though
[38:44.360 --> 38:50.760]  Is not perfect. I do like it for some things. I do like it when I go jogging
[38:51.560 --> 38:57.640]  Really is there's no configuration of you know even with even not even counting connecting it to an iPhone
[38:57.960 --> 39:01.640]  But just connecting it to like the the smallest, you know, I po
[39:01.640 --> 39:06.920]  I've I pod nanos that they ever made or whatever the small one is um
[39:08.120 --> 39:15.320]  No way there's exercising with a wire connected to your ears is it eventually you're going to you're gonna
[39:15.720 --> 39:17.720]  Get tangled up in it
[39:18.520 --> 39:23.480]  So for that it's great, but there's some problems with it where it's the latency isn't great
[39:23.960 --> 39:28.280]  It certainly isn't the instantaneous latency of a wired connection
[39:28.280 --> 39:32.760]  You know like when you hit hit the clicker on your ear thing to pause
[39:33.320 --> 39:34.120]  It takes a moment
[39:34.120 --> 39:38.120]  It there's and it's noticeable that it doesn't pause the audio immediately
[39:38.760 --> 39:43.640]  Yeah, it's a fraction of a second for me now after I've updated the firmware on on these
[39:44.040 --> 39:47.240]  Beats ones that I have but it's definitely noticeable every time
[39:47.240 --> 39:53.000]  I notice it every single time because I'm use I've you know, I don't know a lifetime of thinking that as soon as I hit pause
[39:53.320 --> 39:56.520]  My audio pauses. I mean that was true even in the cassette era
[39:56.520 --> 40:03.240]  Yeah, did the beat some skip ever or sort of like stutter every once in a while
[40:03.800 --> 40:04.840]  Yeah
[40:04.840 --> 40:10.200]  Because that's I've got these plan tronics ones that I that I like well enough they're fairly comfortable
[40:10.760 --> 40:17.800]  And they stay on real well, but yeah, I mean they I tried several really cheap Bluetooth headsets and they were
[40:18.280 --> 40:20.760]  Well, I was really trying to find something that would work with the watch
[40:21.320 --> 40:22.520]  Because I wanted to be able to run
[40:22.520 --> 40:29.560]  You know, just like leave the house with just the wearing just the watch and my and my Bluetooth headphones and the cheap ones just did not
[40:30.120 --> 40:34.360]  You know, this is there was too much way too much skipping and it wasn't a good experience at all
[40:34.520 --> 40:38.760]  So I got these plan tronics ones which are much better, but still every once in a while you get a little skip
[40:39.320 --> 40:46.520]  Mostly much more with the watch than with the phone, but even so I think I've gotten a couple you know a couple instances with the phone too
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  Yeah, wanting to go and
[40:49.000 --> 40:55.320]  You know if I could just put if I could have a copy of overcast on my watch and have the actual tell
[40:56.120 --> 41:01.960]  Overcast or even I would even maybe even go back to Apple's podcast player if it wasn't possible for third-party apps
[41:01.960 --> 41:07.400]  But if I could have the podcasts on my watch and leave the house with nothing but the watch and
[41:08.040 --> 41:10.040]  Bluetooth headphones that would be fantastic
[41:10.760 --> 41:16.920]  Because yeah, any any possible way of carrying the phone stinks for if you're going out running or something like that
[41:16.920 --> 41:18.920]  Yeah, but it's hard now
[41:20.200 --> 41:27.560]  It's not and and it's it's just it's kind of frustrating because that's one of the things that that was one of the first videos. Yeah, like in the first watch
[41:28.440 --> 41:30.120]  demo
[41:30.120 --> 41:36.040]  You know, they show these people jogging with headphones. Yeah, that's not really
[41:36.040 --> 41:39.160]  Yeah, and really that didn't really pan out so well no and when you
[41:39.880 --> 41:42.680]  Once you get to wireless the pairing process
[41:42.680 --> 41:48.440]  No matter how much effort they put into it is nowhere near as seamless as the pairing process of a wired pair of headphones, right?
[41:48.440 --> 41:51.880]  Yeah, pull it out of this one stick it into this one and you're paired
[41:52.360 --> 41:58.200]  Whereas if your wireless headphones are normally paired with your iPhone, but you want to just leave and pair them
[41:58.280 --> 42:00.680]  You know, have it with your watch you've got to go
[42:01.640 --> 42:04.520]  I forget what you even do. I think you have to do it on the phone, right?
[42:04.520 --> 42:09.880]  You go over to the phone and launch the Apple watch app and pair it from there and it's then it's unpaired from yeah
[42:09.880 --> 42:14.440]  It's I don't know it just seems to me like to make it
[42:14.920 --> 42:20.520]  To make that work and make it be the default experience that we use for headphones seems like it's not there
[42:21.160 --> 42:26.280]  And the Bluetooth latency thing and then the skipping and stuff like that. It's definitely an issue Amy has a pair that she bought
[42:27.240 --> 42:33.640]  I forget what brand they were, but she just went to the wire cutter and bought their here's our recommended
[42:33.640 --> 42:39.080]  pair of Bluetooth headphones and she got she just got those and
[42:41.720 --> 42:48.280]  She she was mad she wanted to want Marco to do a wireless head thing because she was very upset because they were not good
[42:48.600 --> 42:55.240]  I think what happened is I think that the wire cutter might be values that cost a little bit more than quality than
[42:55.720 --> 42:57.720]  Then we do
[42:58.200 --> 43:02.440]  Because her skip a lot weren't they still weren't those still a couple hundred bucks because I looked at those two
[43:02.440 --> 43:08.560]  Yeah, they weren't cheap. That's the other thing. Yeah, it wasn't like it wasn't like it was here's what we recommend because it was super low-cost
[43:08.560 --> 43:11.800]  It was sort of a balance between cost and
[43:13.560 --> 43:18.080]  And I might the beats ones I bought were I don't know they were like three or four thousand dollars. Oh
[43:23.160 --> 43:25.160]  You're kidding yeah, okay
[43:25.160 --> 43:31.840]  They were okay for a minute there. I think they were I think that was possible. I do think that they were two hundred bucks
[43:31.840 --> 43:35.120]  I think they're like two hundred ninety nine dollars or two forty nine or something
[43:35.360 --> 43:40.800]  It felt like I this is what I looked at that. Yeah, it felt like I as I was cashing out
[43:40.800 --> 43:43.800]  I bought them in an Apple store just to look at them
[43:43.800 --> 43:48.120]  And I thought I'll buy these beats ones because of these have come out recently that you know
[43:48.120 --> 43:49.800]  They've come out I think they came out this year
[43:49.800 --> 43:55.400]  So it was like after the Apple acquisition. It's not a very Appley product. It's not like Apple has you know
[43:55.400 --> 43:59.840]  This were probably designed beforehand. I mean and they use micro USB which is real gross, but
[44:01.080 --> 44:03.080]  for the charging
[44:03.080 --> 44:06.920]  But I figured if the beats ones don't work right with Apple and I you know
[44:06.920 --> 44:13.120]  I say there's knowing beats is reputation that the audio quality for beats headphones of any sort is not that great in that you're
[44:13.520 --> 44:15.520]  You know overpaying for the brand
[44:15.520 --> 44:20.240]  But I just figured if the beats ones don't work right
[44:21.280 --> 44:27.760]  Which ones will so I might as well just pay for it, but paying two hundred forty nine dollars for a pair of these things really felt like
[44:27.760 --> 44:30.000]  Yeah, and like four thousand dollar
[44:33.600 --> 44:35.760]  Well the plan tronix ones were like ninety bucks
[44:35.760 --> 44:45.000]  And they're they're okay, but if even ones from third parties cost ninety nine dollars can Apple really afford to
[44:46.080 --> 44:50.000]  Well when I say about some cheap ones, I mean though I'd the other ones that I bought were like 30 bucks
[44:50.720 --> 44:54.800]  Hmm, they were really cheap Wow, and I don't recommend that
[44:57.440 --> 45:00.240]  So I had to go so I basically I tried these other ones and I was like, okay
[45:00.240 --> 45:03.640]  This is a terrible experience and I got then I got the plan tronix when I was so I went up
[45:03.640 --> 45:06.800]  I tripled my my out way and
[45:07.960 --> 45:14.040]  Was satisfied enough. I mean I you know, it's like got the watch and I wanted to be able to do this, you know running with the headphones and
[45:15.000 --> 45:15.960]  I
[45:15.960 --> 45:20.480]  At the time like back in the spring. I wasn't sure how much I was gonna like the watch and
[45:21.160 --> 45:26.080]  So I didn't I didn't really want to dump a lot of money on this whole thing
[45:26.080 --> 45:32.280]  So I wanted to I wanted it for particularly for the headphones. I wanted to pay as low as possible. Yeah
[45:35.080 --> 45:39.120]  So I don't know I've seen to me that Apple would have to improve the state of the art
[45:39.840 --> 45:48.160]  Considerably to make that possible as the sort of default experience for how we're going to listen to stuff from our iPhones to make
[45:48.160 --> 45:54.560]  Wireless and I say wireless rather than even Bluetooth because maybe the way that they would do it would be to use their own wireless
[45:54.560 --> 45:56.560]  Carefully
[45:57.280 --> 45:59.280]  Yeah, I don't know if it's not airplane
[46:00.240 --> 46:07.680]  Well, but use something other than Bluetooth simply because I don't I honestly don't think Bluetooth is all that good
[46:07.680 --> 46:14.920]  Like I quit the last month that you know the slogan of the Bluetooth, you know consortium is just way till next year
[46:14.920 --> 46:18.640]  But it really is like ever it's been forever ever since ever
[46:19.120 --> 46:22.120]  Every I ever since I first bought my first Bluetooth product
[46:22.120 --> 46:27.840]  It has always been you figure out you finally get it working and you realize this isn't that great
[46:27.840 --> 46:34.040]  And it's kind of finicky and sometimes it loses it loses its connection even when it's right next door
[46:34.040 --> 46:38.800]  To the thing that's supposed to be connected to and then you go and read about it and they're like you just wait till Bluetooth
[46:38.800 --> 46:42.480]  2.0 it solves all these problems and then Bluetooth 2 come by no comes out
[46:42.480 --> 46:46.440]  You realize that has all these problems and and they say just wait till Bluetooth 3.0
[46:46.440 --> 46:53.880]  Just wait till Bluetooth 4.0 with low power and stuff like that, but it's you know now they're saying you know
[46:53.880 --> 46:57.320]  Whatever the next Bluetooth is gonna solve all these problems. I mean, I hope it does someday
[46:57.320 --> 47:00.400]  But I wouldn't be surprised. I really wouldn't be surprised at all of Apple
[47:00.960 --> 47:05.480]  Just goes proprietary on it and figures out their own short range wireless
[47:06.360 --> 47:08.360]  networking thing
[47:08.360 --> 47:14.000]  That'd be nice. I don't even know if networking is quite the right way to put it, but you know wireless connector technology
[47:14.000 --> 47:21.280]  Just do it on your own. I don't know my my experience though with airplay is not been it's not been great. So I
[47:22.640 --> 47:25.680]  Think that that's more complicated though because I think airplay is
[47:26.800 --> 47:29.560]  Who knows? Yeah, it's dependent on a lot of different things, right?
[47:29.560 --> 47:34.280]  And because it has to go through your network and right and it goes it's not just Bluetooth or something
[47:34.280 --> 47:37.320]  It's you know goes with the Wi-Fi channel and stuff like that
[47:37.320 --> 47:43.680]  The other thing it but it gets back to charging and it gets back to you know that there's if you're using wired
[47:43.680 --> 47:47.680]  Headphones and sharing the same port. There's a problem or if you want to charge it
[47:47.680 --> 47:52.680]  There's a charging problem with wireless headphones too, which is that your headphones can lose their battery power
[47:52.680 --> 47:54.680]  And that's a real bad in the ass
[47:55.680 --> 48:03.760]  And so if your default headphones are wireless now you're just adding yet another thing that you need to charge to your life
[48:03.800 --> 48:09.960]  Like I understand the appeal of wow, this is yet another thing that we don't I need it. I don't need a cable for any more
[48:09.960 --> 48:15.680]  To use but on the other hand you need now. You need another thing that you have to charge all the time
[48:16.880 --> 48:22.880]  And the beats the beats you know have decent battery life. It's about what I kind of I guess about the best
[48:22.880 --> 48:24.240]  I could have hoped for
[48:24.240 --> 48:28.200]  But it's not great. I mean it's you have to you definitely have to remember if you use them all the time
[48:28.200 --> 48:30.200]  You have to remember to charge them a lot
[48:30.640 --> 48:33.920]  The plan for nice thing about the plan tronix is when you turn it on and
[48:34.920 --> 48:37.240]  Actually, I don't think it doesn't work. I should do it when you turn off
[48:37.240 --> 48:42.880]  But when you turn it on it tells you how charged it is hmm. It says battery full or battery
[48:43.080 --> 48:45.000]  Well, you can see partially full
[48:45.200 --> 48:48.480]  It's like that smallest icon have anybody's ever created
[48:48.480 --> 48:53.040]  But when you pair them with their iPhone, there's a little charge indicator up in the menu bar
[48:55.240 --> 48:59.680]  For everything or just for the beats. Oh, maybe it's just for the beat. I thought it was yeah, I haven't
[48:59.680 --> 49:02.560]  So I don't remember seeing that, but I don't and wasn't looking for it
[49:02.560 --> 49:09.600]  It's a ton instead of a battery that torsional. It's a little vertical battery and it is so small that I really I can't see it
[49:09.600 --> 49:16.360]  If I have my contact lenses in okay, I can see it, but I can't read I can't read how high it goes because the it's just
[49:17.360 --> 49:22.920]  I could just tell that it's like there's like a little rectangle there, but I sure it's not your your test to test retina
[49:23.360 --> 49:31.120]  No, it's not it's it really it's even if I closed my bad eye. I can't I just can't make it out if I have my contacts in if I have my glasses on
[49:31.120 --> 49:35.280]  I can take my glasses off and then I can see that close, but it's just way too small
[49:37.600 --> 49:39.600]  What's the indicator on your plan trunks?
[49:40.040 --> 49:46.200]  How does it get to suggest how much battery's left when you turn it when you power it on we put them on and power them on
[49:46.200 --> 49:52.680]  It tells you it talks. Oh like with a voice. Yeah, well, what how did what does it say?
[49:54.000 --> 50:00.000]  Battery well, or I think it's I think it just says connected or headphones connected
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  hmm, and then
[50:02.680 --> 50:07.040]  The beat before the says think it says something else, but I can't remember what it is the beats just play a tone
[50:07.040 --> 50:11.720]  But the tone definitely doesn't change when when you you know given the battery life
[50:13.040 --> 50:15.040]  Well anyway
[50:16.960 --> 50:20.440]  Quincidence of all coincidences our next sponsor is Casper
[50:20.960 --> 50:24.960]  They're the company that makes engineered mattresses at a shockingly fair price
[50:24.960 --> 50:30.260]  And I believe their mattresses come complete with all the legally obligated
[50:32.840 --> 50:36.500]  Which you are free to cut off once you set off set them up at home
[50:37.840 --> 50:43.360]  They have here's what they do. They're like the apple of mattress companies like they don't you don't go to them
[50:43.360 --> 50:51.280]  And then decide whether you want this type of foam or that type of foam or medium sink or this sink or spring technology or that technology
[50:51.280 --> 50:58.160]  These guys have figured out exactly the way a good mattress should feel and they've engineered their own
[50:58.800 --> 51:00.160]  custom
[51:00.160 --> 51:04.640]  Blend of latex foam and memory foam together to have a
[51:05.600 --> 51:10.200]  Mattress that is just right these guys know mattresses. I don't you don't know mattresses
[51:10.200 --> 51:15.240]  I don't know mattresses you buy a mattress every couple years at most frequent these guys think about all the time
[51:15.240 --> 51:17.240]  Their mattress pros. They've got just the right one
[51:17.240 --> 51:24.040]  So all you have to pick is your size. You don't have to go there and figure out whether you want springs or memory foam or latex foam
[51:24.320 --> 51:29.760]  You just get a great mattress. You just pick what size bed you have you get a great mattress and there you go
[51:29.960 --> 51:34.680]  Now the other thing is you're gonna pay a lot less you're getting a high-quality mattress
[51:35.040 --> 51:38.640]  That is made in America American made mattresses
[51:39.240 --> 51:46.760]  And the prices are just fantastic five hundred dollars for twin-size mattress nine hundred fifty dollars for a king-size mattress
[51:46.760 --> 51:51.960]  Compare that to industry prices and it's just outstanding and the whole reason is that they sell direct
[51:51.960 --> 51:55.840]  There are no middlemen. They're not selling to there's no you know middleman
[51:57.200 --> 52:03.080]  Retailers that you go through and that they need to mark up and there's no salesman getting a commission
[52:03.800 --> 52:09.160]  Nothing like that and you even save on the delivery cost because they they because they're made out of this foam
[52:09.160 --> 52:11.160]  And they vacuum seal them up into these
[52:11.440 --> 52:15.200]  Ridiculously little like dorm room refrigerator box size things
[52:15.200 --> 52:18.360]  It even cost less for them to ship them around
[52:19.400 --> 52:20.880]  so
[52:20.880 --> 52:25.960]  If you have any question in your mind if you need a mattress and you're thinking I'd really this Casper thing sounds great
[52:25.960 --> 52:30.520]  You don't have to go to a store. You get a nice little delivery. You just not sure
[52:31.360 --> 52:37.560]  About you know buying this thing online without ever having to to try it out in the store or touch it or lay on it or whatever
[52:38.840 --> 52:42.040]  They have a money back guarantee for a hundred days
[52:42.040 --> 52:45.360]  sleep on the thing for three months, and if you're not happy
[52:45.960 --> 52:48.640]  Just call them up and they will
[52:49.520 --> 52:53.280]  They'll just come you know take it no no questions asked. There's no hard sale
[52:53.280 --> 52:56.040]  They they really do if you don't like it just call them up. They'll take it back
[52:56.440 --> 53:00.360]  Hundred days and that's with free delivery and the return is is painless
[53:01.120 --> 53:07.000]  So here's what you do go to caspersleep.com slash the talk show
[53:07.000 --> 53:13.520]  I think slash talk show works too because I think at some point I might have screwed it up during the sponsor reading a
[53:14.120 --> 53:20.160]  Very very nice enough to fix it and make both work, but I just checked caspersleep.com
[53:20.160 --> 53:26.680]  Slash the talk show does work and when you go there you can save 50 bucks off any mattress off
[53:26.680 --> 53:28.920]  They already low prices just by going there
[53:29.480 --> 53:35.320]  Terms and conditions apply. I don't know what the terms and conditions are but but they do apply so my thanks to Casper
[53:35.320 --> 53:39.960]  And just for disclosure purposes, you're lying on a Casper mattress right now
[53:39.960 --> 53:47.160]  I am I heard that is how I record the show that for acoustic reasons. It's actually very nice acoustics to have
[53:47.600 --> 53:51.720]  Yeah, I think so. Yeah, and I sound better when I'm laying full flat on my back
[53:53.440 --> 53:56.360]  Well, I'll see you helps the diaphragm. Yeah
[53:56.360 --> 54:04.760]  What's the other we got there's another rumor that came out today, and it doesn't make any sense
[54:06.440 --> 54:09.800]  It doesn't make any sense at all to me. So I didn't even know how to write about it
[54:09.800 --> 54:13.080]  I thought you know what this pet if it doesn't make any sense. It's better for the podcast
[54:14.600 --> 54:20.240]  I see it, but I really mean that I actually mean that I find that having a podcast in addition to a blog
[54:20.240 --> 54:26.160]  Some the best stuff to put on the to talk about on the podcast is the stuff that doesn't make any sense to me
[54:26.640 --> 54:30.960]  And this is a story Mac rumors picked it up. This is about the
[54:31.600 --> 54:38.800]  Do you see this with the somebody? I don't know who the source is here, but somebody is saying that Apple is working on
[54:39.920 --> 54:44.200]  Next generation I'm not iPad MacBook Airs
[54:44.200 --> 54:49.080]  13-inch and 15-inch that'll be coming out
[54:50.760 --> 54:52.760]  13-inch and 15-inch
[54:53.320 --> 54:56.920]  This it they are ascended the link right now, but I'll read it to you
[54:58.120 --> 55:03.080]  This is Taiwan. This is information from Taiwan's economic daily news
[55:05.400 --> 55:07.400]  And what they say
[55:07.400 --> 55:11.400]  is
[55:11.960 --> 55:17.680]  Apple may be preparing to introduce a revamped MacBook Air at next year's worldwide developers conference according to Taiwan's
[55:17.680 --> 55:22.960]  Economic Daily News and they have a little Google translate link to the original if Apple holds true to recent history
[55:22.960 --> 55:24.960]  It would be that would be in June
[55:25.800 --> 55:27.800]  blah blah blah
[55:30.600 --> 55:35.960]  Unclear whether an 11-inch model will also be included. I went to the Google translate thing
[55:35.960 --> 55:42.920]  And it did seem like that's what the original article which was written in Chinese you know said that it definitely mentioned the 11-inch and it you know
[55:43.720 --> 55:46.120]  Trans trying to read between the lines of the
[55:47.640 --> 55:52.240]  You know the Google translate English. It seemed like they're saying that it might happen or might not
[55:53.480 --> 55:59.400]  But they're saying 13-inch and 15-inch sizes. No no other stuff about the specs or anything like that
[55:59.400 --> 56:01.400]  No news about whether they're written there or not
[56:01.400 --> 56:03.400]  Um
[56:03.640 --> 56:07.960]  This whole thing makes no sense to me what so no no it makes no sense to me either
[56:09.240 --> 56:10.840]  Because to me
[56:10.840 --> 56:14.960]  Starting even just with the naming of the I of the MacBook
[56:15.280 --> 56:17.640]  You know the one that only has one USB
[56:17.960 --> 56:20.360]  seaport that's for charging and connecting peripherals
[56:22.280 --> 56:27.080]  Which by the way might be a hint as to how much Apple cares about you having to use some kind of
[56:27.080 --> 56:31.400]  Why splitting dongle if you need to charge and listen to something at the same time? Um
[56:32.440 --> 56:37.560]  But anyway the name of it the fact that it is thinner and lighter than a MacBook Air
[56:37.560 --> 56:39.560]  But they just called it the MacBook
[56:39.560 --> 56:42.360]  Certainly suggest to me that the MacBook Air is
[56:42.840 --> 56:48.360]  You know only hanging around because it can be sold cheaper than the MacBook and as the price of
[56:48.840 --> 56:52.600]  Making a MacBook drops eventually the MacBook Airs are gonna go away
[56:52.600 --> 56:56.520]  It doesn't make any sense to me that they would do an next-generation one. Yeah. Yeah
[56:57.800 --> 57:00.600]  It's very strange and and different sizes
[57:01.560 --> 57:05.320]  Yeah, the only thing that that would make sense to me would be if
[57:06.360 --> 57:11.160]  Here's the only way that this story makes sense to me is if they're not talking about MacBook Airs
[57:11.160 --> 57:15.400]  But instead the devices they're talking about are in fact next-generation MacBook Pros
[57:16.360 --> 57:19.320]  Because then 13 and 15-inch are the two sizes
[57:19.320 --> 57:24.440]  and you know compared to the MacBook
[57:25.800 --> 57:29.000]  The current MacBook Pros are rather thick
[57:30.120 --> 57:32.920]  You know and it seems like Apple sort of prefers
[57:33.560 --> 57:35.560]  Asthetically the teardrop
[57:35.560 --> 57:40.920]  Profile for laptops and that the MacBook Pros the retina MacBook Pros in both sizes
[57:41.560 --> 57:45.000]  Have the symmetric rectangular sort of profile
[57:45.000 --> 57:50.120]  Simply because that's the best that they could do at the time to get all the components in to drive the retina screen
[57:51.160 --> 57:53.480]  So my guess would be if there's any truth to this story
[57:53.960 --> 57:58.760]  It would be this would be my guess is that new MacBook Pros are coming next year
[57:58.760 --> 58:03.080]  And they might go back to they might go to like an air-style teardrop
[58:04.040 --> 58:05.800]  profile
[58:05.960 --> 58:13.640]  Yeah, yeah, because if you go through that and replace air with pro it makes a lot more sense. Yeah, and I just think marketing wise
[58:13.640 --> 58:16.360]  I feel like the current situation where they've got three
[58:19.160 --> 58:21.160]  Three types of MacBook
[58:21.800 --> 58:26.920]  Even if you just count the pros and the air's as the same but which size do you want?
[58:26.920 --> 58:27.960]  Which I think is fair
[58:27.960 --> 58:35.240]  I don't think people are confused by whether they want a 11-inch air or 13-inch air or a 13-inch air or 15-inch or a
[58:35.240 --> 58:37.240]  15-inch pro or 15-inch pro
[58:37.240 --> 58:41.240]  I
[58:41.240 --> 58:47.320]  Still think though that having to choose that the MacBook existing alongside the air is just a little bit confusing
[58:47.320 --> 58:50.200]  And I know that there's a well-do you want a retina screen or
[58:50.840 --> 58:54.120]  You know do you want to have the super thin even more portable size
[58:54.680 --> 58:58.600]  But it just seems to me like it's all about what price points they can hit and right now
[58:58.600 --> 59:02.760]  They can't hit that 89 starting price with this MacBook
[59:03.160 --> 59:05.960]  And so the air lives on until it you know
[59:05.960 --> 59:07.960]  Yeah until it can
[59:10.520 --> 59:16.120]  Is the is the retina screen itself that I mean is that the price different I mean is that component?
[59:17.960 --> 59:21.320]  That expensive I guess I think so combined with the
[59:21.880 --> 59:28.280]  Having that graphics card that can drive it because it has to go you know has to really has to you know from a graphics card perspective
[59:28.280 --> 59:32.120]  It really is more of a 4x difference in performance than a 2x
[59:32.120 --> 59:37.560]  It's really the total number of pixels not just how many pixels are in an inch-in-one-to-demand
[59:37.560 --> 59:39.560]  Yeah
[59:39.560 --> 59:44.680]  I really do think it's you know definitely definitely expensive. It doesn't seem like they would
[59:45.640 --> 59:48.520]  Just continue the pro and rename it the air
[59:49.720 --> 59:54.120]  No, that doesn't make any sense another I mean that's another logical possibility going through this
[59:54.120 --> 59:57.320]  But it doesn't that seems unlikely to me. Yeah, because it's it
[59:57.960 --> 1:00:00.920]  You know you can quibble about some of Apple's product naming
[1:00:00.920 --> 1:00:02.920]  strategies
[1:00:02.920 --> 1:00:06.200]  And whether they make sense or not like the way that the
[1:00:07.240 --> 1:00:12.120]  Third generation iPad just became the iPad not the iPad 3
[1:00:13.240 --> 1:00:18.280]  Right wasn't that when they did that yeah, there was like the iPad iPad 2 and then iPad
[1:00:19.320 --> 1:00:21.320]  I think right now we have iPad
[1:00:22.520 --> 1:00:28.360]  Mini-2 and iPad Mini-4 right? Yeah something like there's no there's no iPad
[1:00:28.360 --> 1:00:31.320]  There's no iPad mini-3 on sale, right?
[1:00:33.240 --> 1:00:36.680]  So like when they decide to just number stuff versus
[1:00:37.480 --> 1:00:40.920]  You know like and you know there's it the whole thing is a little
[1:00:42.520 --> 1:00:46.120]  I don't know messy right iPads just get a number that increments
[1:00:46.840 --> 1:00:52.360]  Even if the form factor stays the same but the iPhone you know gets this s every other year
[1:00:52.360 --> 1:00:57.880]  but nothing makes like nothing goes contrary to common sense
[1:00:58.760 --> 1:01:01.640]  Which is what it would be if if the iPad
[1:01:02.360 --> 1:01:05.480]  Or if the MacBook Pro got renamed the MacBook Air
[1:01:06.600 --> 1:01:10.200]  It just that doesn't make any sense because it would be heavier than the regular MacBook
[1:01:13.400 --> 1:01:17.240]  Pro to me says this is more powerful and therefore it's a little heavier
[1:01:18.520 --> 1:01:21.000]  Yeah, whereas air says this is lighter
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.960]  I also think it also makes sense to me because
[1:01:24.520 --> 1:01:31.320]  Something like what they intend to call it in marketing is exactly the sort of thing that whatever the sources in Taiwan
[1:01:31.400 --> 1:01:35.160]  Who told them this would have no access to it so ever right?
[1:01:35.880 --> 1:01:40.440]  Because they're you know, that's just the sort of thing that doesn't that really doesn't leak out of
[1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:42.520]  Cupertino because there's no reason for it
[1:01:43.720 --> 1:01:46.680]  You know, they just know the code name for it, you know, like the
[1:01:46.680 --> 1:01:52.840]  The the companies in Asia just know something, you know, it's called like N68 or something like that. Yeah
[1:01:55.720 --> 1:02:00.840]  So what's the current so the current difference between the air and the pro is mostly is the retina
[1:02:02.280 --> 1:02:05.880]  Display and it's actually very complicated
[1:02:05.880 --> 1:02:09.080]  It's a really like if you just had to buy one right now today
[1:02:09.080 --> 1:02:11.080]  It's to me a very complicated decision
[1:02:11.080 --> 1:02:16.840]  So fit aesthetically the retina screen is the biggest difference and so if you really want to retin the screen
[1:02:16.840 --> 1:02:23.640]  Then you're gonna get the regular MacBook, but the air even though it's cheaper is faster. It has it has higher performance
[1:02:26.920 --> 1:02:30.920]  Huh, I wasn't aware of that. I guess because I've never I've never looked at them
[1:02:30.920 --> 1:02:32.920]  I haven't looked at a MacBook Pro and
[1:02:34.120 --> 1:02:36.520]  Interest of buying one in years right
[1:02:36.520 --> 1:02:42.600]  Because I'm only I'm you know, I've been on the air for a while now
[1:02:42.600 --> 1:02:48.360]  So and I actually am like recently but thinking I asked but you know, I've got mine has been this from 2012
[1:02:48.360 --> 1:02:50.360]  So I'm kind of thinking
[1:02:50.680 --> 1:02:52.680]  It's gonna be time to upgrade soon
[1:02:53.160 --> 1:02:55.640]  This seems like kind of a bad time to do it
[1:02:55.960 --> 1:03:03.240]  I think it probably is because I really don't think you want to buy you don't want to buy another MacBook Air without a retina screen
[1:03:03.240 --> 1:03:07.880]  Whatever the performance games would be and they're you know, three years is pretty significant
[1:03:07.880 --> 1:03:15.160]  But it's I think you could probably get buy until they at least until you see what they come out with next year
[1:03:15.560 --> 1:03:20.440]  Yeah, and I don't yeah, right because I don't want to get a pro and I feel like
[1:03:21.080 --> 1:03:23.080]  I somehow just have this feeling that the
[1:03:23.720 --> 1:03:27.160]  Upgrade in next year's MacBook is gonna be significant
[1:03:27.160 --> 1:03:33.640]  Yeah, you mean the the just plain MacBook. Yes, no modifier right and I just feel I don't know
[1:03:33.640 --> 1:03:36.520]  I know nothing. I don't have any information about
[1:03:37.160 --> 1:03:41.560]  Well, I just know nothing in general, but I know nothing about Apple's product plants
[1:03:41.560 --> 1:03:43.560]  I don't ask people to stuff like that anymore
[1:03:44.760 --> 1:03:46.760]  But just common sense-wise
[1:03:46.760 --> 1:03:50.760]  It I'm almost certain that there'd be a new MacBook next year
[1:03:50.760 --> 1:03:57.000]  And it's probably gonna be a pretty significant upgrade over last year's because A because last year's had a lot of very obvious flaws
[1:03:57.240 --> 1:04:01.400]  So there's low-hanging fruit of how they can make it better and B
[1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:09.160]  It's the first generation of anything that Apple is almost certainly to be able to improve it one year over another
[1:04:09.400 --> 1:04:13.240]  It's it's only when products have been around for three or four revolutions
[1:04:14.760 --> 1:04:20.040]  Where they might let it sit for 18 months between an update because it's you know
[1:04:20.040 --> 1:04:26.680]  They've they've gotten so good at doing blank that this this is good enough. This is actually gonna be able to be
[1:04:28.280 --> 1:04:33.400]  Appealing to customers for you know 18 months or even closer to two years. Yeah
[1:04:36.520 --> 1:04:41.000]  So I don't know I think if they could if they could make the
[1:04:41.960 --> 1:04:48.280]  MacBook better next year and then maybe keep the same one that they started selling last year
[1:04:48.280 --> 1:04:50.280]  But drop the price significantly
[1:04:51.080 --> 1:04:56.360]  Introduce a new one that's better. Keep this one around at a lower price point
[1:04:56.920 --> 1:04:57.880]  Um
[1:04:57.880 --> 1:05:04.760]  Get rid of the air. Yeah, maybe they could get rid of the air and especially to maybe if they could if they can make the pros
[1:05:05.800 --> 1:05:09.080]  Dinner when tear drops. Yeah, right some agree
[1:05:11.160 --> 1:05:16.360]  And improve the performance above right maybe like the 13 inch
[1:05:16.360 --> 1:05:21.160]  or maybe the 11 inch air stays around just to hit that
[1:05:21.160 --> 1:05:23.560]  $8.99 price point or whatever it is that it starts well
[1:05:23.560 --> 1:05:26.280]  Yeah, it seems like the kind of thing that right there would be you know
[1:05:26.840 --> 1:05:29.080]  What we always call like the educational right?
[1:05:29.720 --> 1:05:32.280]  Option whatever the cheap right the thing else
[1:05:33.320 --> 1:05:37.080]  Something that you really have you have to go into the store and like ask to see
[1:05:37.080 --> 1:05:47.000]  The starting prices for the MacBook Air right now 11 inch starts at $8.99 and 13 inch starts at $9.99
[1:05:47.560 --> 1:05:52.760]  So who knows if the MacBook could drop that much year over year, but it
[1:05:54.120 --> 1:05:57.000]  It maybe it could get close once it started now 12.99
[1:05:58.760 --> 1:06:02.600]  Yes, I just loaded the page, but I had to wait for Apple's
[1:06:02.600 --> 1:06:08.360]  Apple's excellent animation to load before I could find it
[1:06:12.040 --> 1:06:17.560]  $12.99 so yeah, I really doubt that it's going to go from $12.99 to $8.99 in a year
[1:06:17.640 --> 1:06:21.960]  So I guess the air gets another year. No, there's no way. There's no way. It's going to go that well
[1:06:22.120 --> 1:06:24.360]  But they haven't always been that well, right?
[1:06:25.080 --> 1:06:30.200]  But I think they can I think they could set it up in a way where they don't emphasize it that much in the way that they
[1:06:30.200 --> 1:06:35.640]  Don't really emphasize very much the free iPhone 5s
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:42.440]  Right that they give a lot of publicity to the you know to the new ones the MacBook and the MacBook Pro
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:48.280]  And then there's the MacBook Air in the back, you know, yeah, but for a long time they started it well
[1:06:48.520 --> 1:06:50.760]  I mean they started at $9.99
[1:06:52.040 --> 1:06:58.440]  And there may have been even a point where they started like $1,100 the laptops. Oh, that one. I mean they used to cost $5,000
[1:06:58.440 --> 1:07:00.440]  Yeah, well, yeah, I mean
[1:07:00.440 --> 1:07:05.240]  I don't mean that long ago, but and and it almost seems like I don't think they'd be
[1:07:06.120 --> 1:07:11.000]  Too adverse to going back to $9.99 when they have the iPad Pro
[1:07:11.640 --> 1:07:17.360]  Mmm sitting in the middle. All right. That's an interesting point that maybe they could maybe they could get away with actually
[1:07:17.360 --> 1:07:23.160]  So many somebody comes in they only want to spend X amount and they say well, how about how about this right?
[1:07:23.160 --> 1:07:27.640]  Because that you know, let's face it their heart isn't really in the
[1:07:29.080 --> 1:07:32.840]  The lowest possibly priced products on that's for sure
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:41.080]  Although I mean I said I would say that the MacBook Air of all of them
[1:07:42.040 --> 1:07:47.000]  Is of the all the lowest price ones is probably not such a bad machine
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:52.360]  No, it's not a bad machine. I just know that you know being non retina
[1:07:53.160 --> 1:07:58.040]  You know it gets back to the whole argument that we you know had many times about
[1:07:58.680 --> 1:08:03.640]  Hey, what should Apple do with the next generation iPhone? Should they keep the same thickness?
[1:08:03.640 --> 1:08:09.000]  It's already so nice and thin and just miniaturize everything and put more battery in an extended battery life
[1:08:09.080 --> 1:08:14.760]  Or should they make the device ever thinner and Apple tends to lean towards making it thinner
[1:08:14.760 --> 1:08:22.280]  And lots of people wish that they would just make the battery life better. That's exactly I mean bottom line putting the argument about just one USB port aside
[1:08:22.840 --> 1:08:24.840]  I think that's ultimately
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:32.280]  The biggest complaint people have about the MacBook is that the air was thin enough and that they should have just kept making battery life better
[1:08:33.800 --> 1:08:38.440]  Yeah, wow really people still complain about the MacBook Air battery life
[1:08:39.080 --> 1:08:41.320]  It's pretty well. It is pretty good. I guess
[1:08:41.320 --> 1:08:45.880]  Yeah, but that they you know or that they could have this as someone who does not have a current one
[1:08:45.880 --> 1:08:49.640]  I would well and maybe the performance know how good you have it
[1:08:49.640 --> 1:08:54.280]  Maybe it maybe it's not even battery if it maybe it comes down to things like performance that they would have to go with this low power
[1:08:54.680 --> 1:08:56.040]  Core M
[1:08:56.040 --> 1:08:58.360]  You know CPU they could have had the you know
[1:08:58.360 --> 1:09:04.040]  Just keep making that you know just keep that form factor and just switch to a retina display and keep making
[1:09:04.680 --> 1:09:06.920]  The performance better. I mean more or less
[1:09:06.920 --> 1:09:09.960]  I think that what people wanted was for them to do a retina
[1:09:09.960 --> 1:09:15.560]  MacBook Air yeah, and it looks I think it looks like they're never going to do it this no
[1:09:15.560 --> 1:09:19.160]  I was rumor we're talking about aside. I just don't see it. No
[1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:23.080]  Yeah, I mean it died by Korea. I think this is the the pro
[1:09:25.080 --> 1:09:27.880]  Not the air. Yeah, it didn't say anything about colors
[1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:32.120]  It'd be interesting to know whether the pro is going to go with like color options for
[1:09:32.120 --> 1:09:38.600]  Chark what do they call no not charcoal space gray space gray yeah, I would love to have space gray one
[1:09:40.520 --> 1:09:45.080]  Yeah, I don't want I don't covet the MacBook at all because it's it you know
[1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:47.640]  I want more RAM and I like having a MacBook Pro
[1:09:48.760 --> 1:09:51.320]  But I do covet the way that it looks. I love the space gray
[1:09:53.400 --> 1:09:55.400]  Yeah
[1:09:55.400 --> 1:10:02.600]  Although when I it starts it starts with eight gigs of RAM. Yeah, well, I've I think I've actually I have whatever. You've got this
[1:10:02.600 --> 1:10:05.640]  I think it's got okay. All right, I have a lot of tabs
[1:10:08.280 --> 1:10:11.320]  It's all all browser tabs must be nice
[1:10:14.600 --> 1:10:16.920]  Let's take a break and then show you a log with four
[1:10:16.920 --> 1:10:23.880]  Let's take a break and let me tell you about a long time friend of the show our good friends at igloo igloo
[1:10:25.640 --> 1:10:32.760]  Makes the internet that you will actually like the rise of web apps when web apps started to become a real thing in the late 90s
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:42.440]  It crippled a lot of the software leaders of the previous generation and the tech industry today is going mobile and the same process
[1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:51.160]  Seems to be happening again where anything that isn't really a mobile isn't going to it doesn't work great on mobile isn't going to work for companies
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:54.680]  igloo is
[1:10:54.680 --> 1:11:01.720]  An internet for your small team or your big team or your big company or your small company really does scale to any sort of size
[1:11:01.960 --> 1:11:03.960]  that you will actually like and
[1:11:04.280 --> 1:11:09.960]  It doesn't look like it was designed in the late 90s. It looks like it was designed recently. That's because it was
[1:11:09.960 --> 1:11:17.000]  And it works great on mobile because part of what they've done is all this great responsive design for the stuff
[1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:21.400]  It's all web-based and it really does it scales for everything from a
[1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:27.480]  You know an iPhone to a tablet to your you know 30 inch or 27 inch iMac
[1:11:28.520 --> 1:11:30.520]  really looks great
[1:11:30.680 --> 1:11:38.520]  Really is easy to use and really does feel modern which is not what you feel when you use a lot of existing internet software
[1:11:38.520 --> 1:11:44.200]  Things you can do you can ask access your task lip task lists
[1:11:44.920 --> 1:11:50.200]  From a laptop during a meeting you can update your team on the progress of the most recent project from your phone
[1:11:51.240 --> 1:11:53.880]  Access the latest version of a file from home
[1:11:54.680 --> 1:11:56.040]  And
[1:11:56.040 --> 1:12:01.800]  Everything stays in sync because it's all web-based so what you've done on your laptop when you go look at your phone all up to date
[1:12:02.360 --> 1:12:04.360]  Everything's on mobile
[1:12:04.360 --> 1:12:12.040]  If you do things if your team still works by emailing files to each other you guys should really check out igloo because this really does

[1:12:51.880 --> 1:12:54.200]  What else you got to talk about what else is going on this week?
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:01.400]  Maybe I should have something to talk about you should know you want to talk about you want to talk about you want to talk about well
[1:13:01.400 --> 1:13:03.400]  You want to talk about sir or is it all?
[1:13:04.680 --> 1:13:10.200]  No, no, okay, you know I know you don't want to talk about I don't want to talk about I know you're yeah, I don't know
[1:13:10.200 --> 1:13:14.680]  I know you don't want to talk about all right, so if we can do it without talking spoilers then I will talk about
[1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:17.160]  well, okay, so
[1:13:17.160 --> 1:13:19.160]  Do you have tickets? I do oh?
[1:13:19.160 --> 1:13:23.080]  Definitely okay, and you know this is one where I really care and
[1:13:23.640 --> 1:13:25.640]  Amy is sort of
[1:13:26.680 --> 1:13:29.080]  Evately interested but not like me
[1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:32.120]  And I didn't know you had to pre-order
[1:13:32.360 --> 1:13:36.920]  I'm the dad who no longer understand how movies the atrical movies work
[1:13:37.320 --> 1:13:39.640]  You know, I mean like I remember what when I was you know
[1:13:39.800 --> 1:13:44.040]  Young and my dad found out the movies were five dollars, you know for like kids ticket
[1:13:44.600 --> 1:13:46.680]  He couldn't believe it. He just could be you know
[1:13:46.680 --> 1:13:50.440]  Just absolutely couldn't believe that five it costs five dollars to go to a movie
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:54.840]  I'm like that now both with prices like when Jonas and I went to see
[1:13:54.840 --> 1:14:01.560]  Specter and I didn't know about this online ordering. It doesn't make any sense to me
[1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:06.120]  It seems to me like if you want to go see I just assumed that if you want to go see Star Wars on opening weekend
[1:14:06.120 --> 1:14:12.120]  You got to go you got to drive somewhere and then you get out and you go wait in a big long line with lots of people and
[1:14:12.760 --> 1:14:17.240]  After you wait in line you go see the movie, but it turns out what you need to do is buy your tickets in advance
[1:14:17.240 --> 1:14:20.640]  I didn't know this Amy did and really sort of saved my bacon
[1:14:20.640 --> 1:14:27.280]  Sorry, wait are you seeing you cannot buy tickets at the no you can't I think for opening that weekend because yeah
[1:14:27.280 --> 1:14:33.680]  Because you'll never get him. Yeah, I don't I think you'll never get in unless unless they open unless they surprise people by having
[1:14:34.240 --> 1:14:38.560]  More screenings of it than they're publicizing in advance. Yeah
[1:14:39.520 --> 1:14:42.880]  They might do because that seems like that would be I mean
[1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:50.240]  Yeah, although they might pre-sell, you know, maybe you have to figure out the second pre-sell date to get in on those
[1:14:50.560 --> 1:14:54.240]  I mean it seems as though it's it seems like it
[1:14:54.800 --> 1:15:01.680]  It might before it even happens that it might become the biggest box office opening weekend ever I think it's gonna be huge
[1:15:02.640 --> 1:15:05.360]  It's gonna be so I still so I think I'm out
[1:15:06.400 --> 1:15:10.080]  Oh, cuz I don't know tickets. I don't know tickets yet. Well, so I
[1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:12.080]  Mm-hmm
[1:15:12.080 --> 1:15:17.840]  My son doesn't like going to the movies that much. He isn't like going out to the movies that much
[1:15:18.720 --> 1:15:22.160]  and so I approached him with the idea going to that and he at first he was going yeah
[1:15:24.480 --> 1:15:26.000]  And
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  Then when I showed him the trailer he was a little more interested so I still haven't gotten like a firm
[1:15:30.960 --> 1:15:34.720]  firm commitment and I'm not exactly sure when we would
[1:15:35.760 --> 1:15:38.080]  Schedule this event, so I feel I feel like
[1:15:38.080 --> 1:15:39.200]  uh
[1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:42.400]  rushing out and buying tickets as I I'm like I'm not I'm not even putting out
[1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:48.240]  Yeah, I wonder if there's like a stub hub aftermarket forum like supporting events like it seems crazy, but
[1:15:49.120 --> 1:15:54.480]  I mean it's absolutely insane how hard it was and it was one of those things where I did it the first night that
[1:15:54.480 --> 1:16:00.480]  They went on sale at the right time and really only I really I must say only because my wife is like are you gonna buy Star Wars tickets?
[1:16:00.480 --> 1:16:03.600]  And I'm like what are you talking about and she explained to me and I immediately, you know
[1:16:03.600 --> 1:16:10.640]  Randa, I think it's fan dango. Yeah. Yeah funny thing to say and it was like buying an Apple product
[1:16:11.120 --> 1:16:14.080]  When they first go on sale like their website was going down
[1:16:15.040 --> 1:16:21.360]  You know it was saying ridiculous things like yeah, that was the other thing like I couldn't actually get on Fandango
[1:16:22.240 --> 1:16:27.360]  It was saying things like that the movie theater was didn't have any tickets available for a certain show
[1:16:27.920 --> 1:16:33.280]  And more two minutes after they went on sale. I was like that can't be it can't be that they've sold out in
[1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:35.520]  Two minutes and in fact it wasn't but it was like they
[1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:44.400]  Their back end was just completely blown apart and then the worst of all any kind of thing like this when you're in like a mad rush to buy tickets
[1:16:44.480 --> 1:16:53.360]  Is when you you get through you get the tickets you want and you're going through the process of like signing in to Fandango
[1:16:53.600 --> 1:16:56.240]  And then they just says like an error occurred
[1:16:56.240 --> 1:17:01.520]  And you're like do I have tickets or I do I not have tickets and you don't know
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:05.280]  And it's hard to even check if you have tickets because their website is down
[1:17:05.840 --> 1:17:12.080]  And then you go and find out that no you don't have tickets yet. It was it was stressful, but I do I have tickets for
[1:17:14.720 --> 1:17:18.240]  I think it's a 10 o'clock showing on Thursday the night
[1:17:18.720 --> 1:17:25.840]  Before it opened before yeah, and I've already been told that I will be I will be responsible for taking Jones school
[1:17:25.840 --> 1:17:36.000]  You're getting up early. Yeah, you're staying up late and getting up early and then I got
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:42.560]  I think I've Saturday afternoon matinee tickets at a it seems like a better theater like a place with reserved seating
[1:17:44.560 --> 1:17:50.560]  Okay, so you have two sets of tickets. I have two sets of tickets. I have Thursday night and then Saturday matinee
[1:17:50.560 --> 1:17:57.920]  I was trying to find it that I was gonna show you that one of the things that you know when Fandango was going down
[1:17:58.080 --> 1:18:01.040]  With a one of the images that you which you may have seen or may not have seen
[1:18:01.040 --> 1:18:05.360]  But one of the images that they showed was um was Han and Chewie like working on the Millennium Falcon
[1:18:08.400 --> 1:18:10.400]  So it's like you know like
[1:18:10.400 --> 1:18:15.520]  Something's gone wrong, and it's like you know Han's got the goggles on and they're like welding
[1:18:16.320 --> 1:18:19.680]  Welding the Millennium Falcon from like return or Empire Strikes Back
[1:18:19.680 --> 1:18:22.000]  That's actually pretty funny. Yeah
[1:18:23.520 --> 1:18:27.840]  Nicely done. You know, that's one of those things. I have to rewatch. I haven't I have not
[1:18:28.160 --> 1:18:34.800]  Rewatched those films in a while at least ever since it was announced that hey Disney's buying
[1:18:35.840 --> 1:18:41.600]  Star Wars, and we're gonna reboot the franchise or not reboot, but which I think would be terrible that would be like
[1:18:42.240 --> 1:18:44.240]  We're gonna recast on solo
[1:18:44.240 --> 1:18:49.280]  No, that'd be awful, but you know relaunch it. We're gonna you know
[1:18:49.280 --> 1:18:54.880]  We're doing the the trilogy that everybody always wanted to take place after you know the one that you loved
[1:18:57.440 --> 1:19:03.760]  I immediately just stop watching all of them and I thought I'll just you know a weight and then whenever this movie actually comes out
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:07.600]  You know, we'll have like a little family movie weekend and we'll watch all the old ones
[1:19:08.800 --> 1:19:10.800]  So I'm excited to do that
[1:19:10.800 --> 1:19:12.800]  Including the prequels
[1:19:12.800 --> 1:19:14.800]  Yeah, I think you have to include them
[1:19:16.320 --> 1:19:18.320]  I don't know. It's so hard
[1:19:18.320 --> 1:19:23.040]  You know, that's an interesting thing. It's I've said this before on the show where it's I've noticed, you know
[1:19:23.040 --> 1:19:26.880]  And I've I've Jonas has been watching him since he was ridiculously early
[1:19:27.600 --> 1:19:29.600]  or young
[1:19:30.080 --> 1:19:34.160]  He's never been a kid who's you know, he's sort of a very gentle kid in real life
[1:19:35.280 --> 1:19:39.600]  He is not like a you know get Rami and roughhouse, you know
[1:19:39.600 --> 1:19:45.360]  Sort of kid and so he'd you know like dealing with like a violent action movie if you
[1:19:45.360 --> 1:19:51.200]  You know even considering Star Wars is sort of violent has never caused him to like act up in ways
[1:19:51.200 --> 1:19:52.400]  And it's never you know
[1:19:52.400 --> 1:19:57.040]  He was afraid of the rank or and oh, and he didn't like watching the Wampa. He'd run out of the room for that one
[1:19:57.040 --> 1:20:02.880]  Yeah, but he you know, but he could handle that sort of thing too like like so if they're like he didn't want to see the Wampa
[1:20:04.480 --> 1:20:07.280]  But it wouldn't like keep him up at night or make him cry
[1:20:07.280 --> 1:20:09.520]  All it did is when he watched Empire strikes back
[1:20:09.520 --> 1:20:12.880]  He would just he knew when it was coming and he just ran out of the room and
[1:20:13.440 --> 1:20:17.440]  Then he'd just sort of wait until he could hear that it was over and then he'd run back in
[1:20:17.920 --> 1:20:20.880]  Yeah, and he was fine. So we let him watch him early the thing
[1:20:20.880 --> 1:20:22.880]  I noticed was that
[1:20:22.880 --> 1:20:28.480]  They all blurred together for him as a kid and maybe you know, I'm sure somewhere if he's listening Syracuse says
[1:20:29.920 --> 1:20:33.600]  Really angry at me that I didn't really strategize this aspect of my father
[1:20:33.600 --> 1:20:37.120]  That I just let him watch what he wanted to um
[1:20:37.680 --> 1:20:45.600]  But my theory on that is that I just can't see if if you've got unlimited access to Star Wars movies that you can watch in your home on a nice TV
[1:20:46.240 --> 1:20:49.600]  I just couldn't I couldn't bring myself to not let him do it
[1:20:49.760 --> 1:20:55.680]  Like it would have driven me nuts to if when I was a kid if I could have had all this all the Star Wars you could eat
[1:20:56.320 --> 1:20:58.480]  To not be able to do it
[1:20:58.480 --> 1:21:00.240]  So I let him do it and it blurred together
[1:21:00.240 --> 1:21:04.800]  And I noticed when he'd play with his friends early like kindergarten and first grade
[1:21:05.600 --> 1:21:06.400]  um
[1:21:06.400 --> 1:21:12.400]  A it impressed me and I really enjoyed the fact that his his heinous friends were really into Star Wars
[1:21:12.480 --> 1:21:15.600]  Not quite to the way that you and I were back in the day
[1:21:16.160 --> 1:21:17.600]  Yeah
[1:21:17.600 --> 1:21:22.960]  You know the way that really Star Wars was everything to me everything and yeah, and you know
[1:21:23.680 --> 1:21:25.680]  77 through 83 or so
[1:21:25.680 --> 1:21:30.480]  Um, it was the only thing that mattered. Um, it's not quite like that
[1:21:30.480 --> 1:21:32.640]  But they were you know, it was more than just you know
[1:21:32.960 --> 1:21:36.080]  Well this week they're in the Star Wars in the next week. They were into something else
[1:21:36.080 --> 1:21:41.440]  They were really into Star Wars for all but it all blurred together for them like they just didn't see two
[1:21:41.920 --> 1:21:46.880]  Two trilogies where one was a lot better than another. They just see it's psalm all
[1:21:47.680 --> 1:21:50.640]  And I found that very odd. Yeah, that is interesting
[1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:53.440]  Hank has never seen the the prequels
[1:21:53.440 --> 1:22:00.160]  See you're just like sure. You see you're probably a better. Well. I started out like that. I started out like no
[1:22:00.400 --> 1:22:02.400]  He's not gonna he's not gonna see him
[1:22:02.640 --> 1:22:04.800]  um, and then you know, we got through
[1:22:05.840 --> 1:22:08.240]  The you know, he's so he's seen all the
[1:22:09.040 --> 1:22:11.040]  original movies a few times
[1:22:11.760 --> 1:22:17.440]  Um, not relentlessly like I have but he's seen them a few times and then he got really into the Clone Wars the
[1:22:18.160 --> 1:22:22.640]  Animated yeah, he was and for him. That's really his Star Wars. I think yeah
[1:22:22.640 --> 1:22:27.040]  But how do you really like that a lot? So why would you let him watch the the Clone Wars?
[1:22:27.040 --> 1:22:30.560]  But not watch the prequels. I I think the Clone Wars
[1:22:30.960 --> 1:22:32.960]  Animated shows better than the prequels
[1:22:33.760 --> 1:22:36.400]  I in many ways I agree
[1:22:36.800 --> 1:22:39.840]  But I feel like they're of a piece because it is clearly
[1:22:40.480 --> 1:22:45.760]  In terms of the timing, you know, it's it's entirely within the realm of you know, Anakin and and uh
[1:22:47.120 --> 1:22:49.120]  Obi-Wan, you know
[1:22:49.680 --> 1:22:51.600]  Being the buddy cops. Yeah
[1:22:51.600 --> 1:22:55.120]  But so as well. So when Clone Wars ended
[1:22:55.760 --> 1:22:57.760]  I thought okay. Well, maybe now
[1:22:58.800 --> 1:23:01.200]  In this lull is the time to watch
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:07.040]  The prequels and I got what I got like a fan at it. I thought if we're from gonna do this
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:11.680]  At least gonna I'm at least gonna cut out as much a charge or as I possibly can
[1:23:12.400 --> 1:23:16.560]  And so and I offered I said, okay, let's week we can watch them and he said now. I'm okay
[1:23:17.040 --> 1:23:19.600]  You realize that this is this is a lot like
[1:23:19.600 --> 1:23:23.120]  It's a lot like a religious cult
[1:23:26.080 --> 1:23:28.480]  Right like we're you're you're
[1:23:30.080 --> 1:23:33.920]  Using your son to not believe in your jar. That's right
[1:23:34.720 --> 1:23:38.480]  Well, I don't think I don't think I'm wrong. I know jury in the world would convict me right
[1:23:38.480 --> 1:23:45.040]  But imagine imagine how this could play out though over the decades where let's say he does agree to watch with you and you guys watch
[1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:50.400]  The Phantom Menace, but you watch your fan at it cut
[1:23:52.240 --> 1:23:55.520]  And I'm not doubting that that fan at it cut is probably a better picture
[1:23:56.160 --> 1:24:01.040]  And must be it might be a really great experience if you've never seen the the Lucas cut
[1:24:01.520 --> 1:24:07.360]  Yeah, but then imagine like 30 years from now where he sees the Lucas cut and and he's talking to somebody
[1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:10.480]  You know of similar age and they're like remember that jar jar
[1:24:10.480 --> 1:24:15.600]  And he's like, what the hell are you talking about? He's only in it for like five minutes. Why are you rail? Why are you really?
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:20.400]  He's like in the background. He's not even doing it
[1:24:22.400 --> 1:24:24.400]  Cut out all of his
[1:24:24.400 --> 1:24:26.400]  ridiculous antics
[1:24:26.400 --> 1:24:31.200]  I saw him but so but so he didn't he didn't want us. He didn't want us. He was he was kind of done
[1:24:32.080 --> 1:24:37.120]  And then since like as I thought oh well after the the rebels thing that you know
[1:24:37.120 --> 1:24:42.080]  I'm perhaps like oh he likes the the enemy and stuff maybe he'll watch rebels and now he's he's like no no
[1:24:42.080 --> 1:24:44.080]  It's like he's moved. It's like he's moved on
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:49.760]  But he might be he might be getting he might be coming around to the
[1:24:50.480 --> 1:24:55.600]  To the movie though, so I'm hoping yeah, maybe you know, maybe Disney might solve this problem for you
[1:24:55.600 --> 1:24:58.400]  But he'll they'll just bombard him with the marketing and
[1:24:59.360 --> 1:25:03.120]  It's right. Yeah, and other kids at school too. Right exactly
[1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:04.720]  I think that I think that might happen as well
[1:25:04.720 --> 1:25:08.640]  But also largely partly due to Disney like I feel like Disney knows how to
[1:25:09.360 --> 1:25:13.440]  Yeah, like it's a good thing Disney doesn't try to sell cigarettes. Yeah
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:19.200]  He was in yeah, really he was in the hospital for a few days and he's fine now
[1:25:19.920 --> 1:25:22.640]  But when he was well, he was sick
[1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:25.360]  And this was just like last month
[1:25:26.080 --> 1:25:30.160]  Or no, this is currently still this month, but when those airs it will have been last month
[1:25:31.120 --> 1:25:32.240]  He
[1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:36.400]  We started watching James Bond movies. Oh, which he had not seen before
[1:25:37.360 --> 1:25:40.720]  And I'd offered I think I'd offered once or twice before, but he was not
[1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:44.400]  You know, he had not he didn't really know enough James Bond to be interested
[1:25:45.280 --> 1:25:50.880]  But I think one of them just ended up being on the hospital TV and he started watching it and liked it and so we watched
[1:25:52.240 --> 1:25:54.560]  I think we saw three of the
[1:25:55.360 --> 1:26:00.640]  Pierce Brosnan and then we watched both of the Timothy Dalton and a bunch of Roger Moore
[1:26:00.640 --> 1:26:02.640]  That was as far as we that was as far as we got
[1:26:03.520 --> 1:26:06.960]  But he's seen like now. I mean, you know in the pet in a span of like
[1:26:08.400 --> 1:26:10.400]  Three weeks he's seen
[1:26:10.400 --> 1:26:16.240]  Another great swath of James Bond that he had never seen before and he liked him. He thought that and and I think because he was sick
[1:26:16.400 --> 1:26:19.920]  So when we got home, I showed I started showing him
[1:26:21.040 --> 1:26:23.040]  casino royale and
[1:26:23.040 --> 1:26:29.440]  And I think that it's updated and sort of more realistic
[1:26:31.120 --> 1:26:32.480]  Tone
[1:26:32.480 --> 1:26:36.800]  Was not as comforting to him as like the slow pace of the older
[1:26:37.600 --> 1:26:42.400]  Of the older ones like being sick. He wanted something that you know he that the
[1:26:43.440 --> 1:26:46.560]  Roger Moore running around and and pants up to his chest
[1:26:46.560 --> 1:26:52.080]  In the 80s was kind of something that was kind of comforting. Yeah, the Roger Moore ones and again
[1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:55.280]  They're probably in hindsight and his time goes on. They're my least favorite
[1:26:56.240 --> 1:27:00.560]  But I'd love them though because they were the new ones when I was a kid. Yeah, and
[1:27:01.120 --> 1:27:10.160]  And it's funny because to me as a kid the Roger Moore ones looked just crackled with newness like just like an unopened
[1:27:10.400 --> 1:27:12.400]  package from
[1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:16.800]  Company, you know like an unopened Apple product, you know like they just seem new and
[1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:24.240]  The connery ones seemed old like in the way that like everything in Star Wars was meant to look old like the Millennium Falcon like
[1:27:24.720 --> 1:27:28.080]  And then it's just ridiculous because it was only a difference of like ten years
[1:27:28.080 --> 1:27:29.920]  But I could just see the difference, you know
[1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:35.600]  I could see that the suits that Connery was wearing aren't in style today, you know, whatever year in
[1:27:36.160 --> 1:27:38.160]  1979 or 80 or whatever I was
[1:27:38.560 --> 1:27:41.360]  Watching I was like it looks so sixties. It looks ancient
[1:27:41.360 --> 1:27:49.360]  Because it just seemed to me like like when I was a kid when I was a ten-year-old kid the sixties seemed longer ago than they do to me today
[1:27:52.240 --> 1:27:58.240]  Because when you're a kid your sense of time is so acute and your sense of newness and currency and
[1:27:58.800 --> 1:28:01.360]  Stuff like that and I just love the more ones
[1:28:01.360 --> 1:28:07.520]  But even in hindsight now that the more ones look dated and I think probably are the most dated of any of them
[1:28:07.520 --> 1:28:12.000]  Because they were like the ones that I feel like we're just the most faddish
[1:28:12.800 --> 1:28:19.040]  Yeah, his outfits and a lot of those are just a circle right in that even the early I mean even the earlier ones
[1:28:19.280 --> 1:28:23.360]  Yeah, I mean by the time it gets to the eighties. It's just he's just so old, but it's
[1:28:24.640 --> 1:28:26.400]  Kind of it's kind of painful
[1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:32.400]  I I kind of excuse it because I think the seventies were a really odd decade where
[1:28:32.400 --> 1:28:38.000]  It would have been very difficult for them to to address him
[1:28:38.720 --> 1:28:41.120]  in a in a more timeless fashion
[1:28:41.920 --> 1:28:46.080]  Like I feel like they you can get away with that in most it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't cool
[1:28:46.480 --> 1:28:50.080]  Yeah, it was so and it was so decidedly uncool that it just couldn't be done
[1:28:50.640 --> 1:28:56.080]  But overall the more ones to me they just go down like they just go down like ice cream on a hot day
[1:28:56.400 --> 1:29:00.240]  It's just it's just you don't have to work to get into them at all
[1:29:00.240 --> 1:29:03.440]  Yeah, and they don't ask you to
[1:29:04.240 --> 1:29:06.240]  Accept anything unpleasant
[1:29:06.720 --> 1:29:10.160]  You know, there's there's you know like a nasty edge to the Connery ones
[1:29:10.160 --> 1:29:11.680]  It's certainly in terms of the content
[1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:18.480]  There's nothing that it's really alarming in an operatively violent because of when they were made or at least in terms of what's actually shown on screen
[1:29:19.040 --> 1:29:22.880]  But there's a certain nasty undertone to to Connery yes
[1:29:23.520 --> 1:29:28.000]  Yeah, yeah, and more as you know, it was was much more relaxed
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:32.880]  I've always said too like talking about these like one of the things is that with more he played it in a way
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:40.400]  That it there was a sense that he knew he was James Bond and it already read the script and knew that he was going to
[1:29:40.400 --> 1:29:43.360]  He knew that no matter what predicament he was in at the moment it
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:47.920]  Hey, I know where the third act ends. I'm in a raft on the ocean. You know girl
[1:29:49.200 --> 1:29:51.040]  You know, it's all gonna be okay. Yeah
[1:29:51.040 --> 1:29:59.360]  Like he just always played it as a guy who had already read the end of the script and knew where this was going
[1:30:00.320 --> 1:30:03.280]  There's still I mean there's something like there's one of them and I can't remember
[1:30:04.560 --> 1:30:06.640]  I want to say for your eyes only but like where he
[1:30:08.240 --> 1:30:12.800]  He slaps the female. Oh, you know the woman around
[1:30:14.160 --> 1:30:17.120]  And and you know, it's really kind of threatening
[1:30:17.120 --> 1:30:21.280]  It's your and then you know, and then of course, you know
[1:30:25.280 --> 1:30:27.280]  Come on
[1:30:29.280 --> 1:30:33.680]  Yeah, that's our notes. I don't remember which I they do all they they blur together
[1:30:33.680 --> 1:30:36.880]  But it might be for your eyes only and I it it's
[1:30:37.920 --> 1:30:43.520]  It's a scene that seems you wouldn't have really thought well you might have it would have you would have thought twice about it
[1:30:43.520 --> 1:30:45.520]  but it would have felt
[1:30:45.520 --> 1:30:51.360]  natural for Connery's bond to do it and it just really felt out of place with Roger Morris
[1:30:52.240 --> 1:30:57.840]  Not even not even at Roger Morris an actor couldn't do it, but it just didn't go along with
[1:30:58.480 --> 1:31:00.720]  The the rest of how we played the character
[1:31:01.520 --> 1:31:03.520]  right
[1:31:07.520 --> 1:31:10.960]  So let me just just just be clear here that you've
[1:31:10.960 --> 1:31:15.360]  You're parenting is such that you've never allowed your son
[1:31:17.120 --> 1:31:21.600]  To see the people yeah, they are the line George our binks
[1:31:22.480 --> 1:31:24.480]  You've drawn the line that's too far
[1:31:25.600 --> 1:31:30.400]  James Bond slapping one massaged me a okay
[1:31:31.520 --> 1:31:33.520]  violent massaged
[1:31:33.520 --> 1:31:39.280]  All right, let me take a break here before we wrap it up
[1:31:39.280 --> 1:31:43.040]  I have one more one more sponsor to thank and it's our good friends at Harry's now
[1:31:43.280 --> 1:31:44.720]  Here's the thing. This is the time of year
[1:31:44.720 --> 1:31:50.800]  I get very stressed because you got to start buying gifts for people. I find gift giving and I'm not joking here
[1:31:50.800 --> 1:31:53.520]  I find it incredibly stressful. I never know what to buy any buddy
[1:31:55.360 --> 1:31:57.520]  And I get all stressed out and then I put it off
[1:31:57.600 --> 1:32:00.160]  I procrastinate because I'm stressed out and then
[1:32:00.160 --> 1:32:06.080]  Come December 23rd or so. It's just a disaster and I wind up buying everybody stuff from
[1:32:06.800 --> 1:32:08.800]  you know 711
[1:32:09.360 --> 1:32:11.360]  I'm to really a terrible gift giver
[1:32:12.560 --> 1:32:18.000]  It here's an easy solution. No, if you can find anybody if you've any been in your shopping lift who you might want to buy
[1:32:18.480 --> 1:32:23.360]  Like a Harry's shaving kit for it's a great idea. It is really nice
[1:32:23.360 --> 1:32:25.920]  It's great in every way because a it's a high quality product
[1:32:25.920 --> 1:32:30.000]  Be it comes in great packaging. So it looks nice
[1:32:30.080 --> 1:32:33.760]  And then you look like somebody who gives thoughtful well-designed stylish stuff
[1:32:34.880 --> 1:32:36.880]  And see it's really really
[1:32:37.440 --> 1:32:42.400]  Remarkably competitively priced way lower than shaving stuff from Gillette or anything like that
[1:32:43.840 --> 1:32:45.840]  So you got like a dad a brother
[1:32:46.560 --> 1:32:47.760]  husband
[1:32:47.760 --> 1:32:53.200]  Boyfriend any kind of maybe like even if you work has like a secret sanit type thing
[1:32:53.200 --> 1:32:55.840]  Just go to harrys.com and check out their shaving sets
[1:32:57.520 --> 1:32:59.520]  And if you don't have one yourself you could do that too
[1:33:00.800 --> 1:33:05.920]  They sent me their holiday set. They've got this holiday set and it's great
[1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:07.120]  I actually
[1:33:07.120 --> 1:33:12.400]  Hadn't had a new harry's kit for years because they sent me the first one years ago when they first started sponsoring the show
[1:33:12.400 --> 1:33:15.040]  And I still have that same original harry's
[1:33:15.360 --> 1:33:18.240]  handle which still looks brand new
[1:33:19.120 --> 1:33:22.000]  All I've ever done from them is just keep buying new blades because
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:27.680]  That's all I've ever needed to replace well. They sent me this harry holiday set just so I could see it
[1:33:27.680 --> 1:33:29.680]  So I know what I'm talking about
[1:33:30.320 --> 1:33:36.640]  And it's great. It is everything. I like about harry's. It's a great handle great blades comes with some shaving cream
[1:33:37.600 --> 1:33:39.120]  In a really really
[1:33:39.120 --> 1:33:41.360]  Gorgeously designed package again
[1:33:41.360 --> 1:33:44.720]  I've said this many times before and I mean it's a sort of packaging where I
[1:33:45.040 --> 1:33:51.520]  The pack rat in me hates to throw it out because it is so nice and it's even just little things like when you open their stuff
[1:33:51.520 --> 1:33:56.720]  You don't have to like rip it open to do it. It's all nice folding boxes that fold back together
[1:33:57.280 --> 1:34:01.280]  And it just makes you not even want to throw away the packaging go to
[1:34:02.160 --> 1:34:07.280]  Harries.com remember my code talk show that I'll save you five dollars off your first order
[1:34:07.600 --> 1:34:09.680]  And if you're doing this for the holidays

[1:34:36.800 --> 1:34:39.280]  2015 so my thanks to harries
[1:34:40.320 --> 1:34:42.320]  What else we got we got to wrap it up
[1:34:43.360 --> 1:34:48.480]  Seems like I think I was actually thinking of the man with a golden gun just to be clear
[1:34:48.480 --> 1:34:51.680]  Yeah, you know what now that you say that that makes sense that this makes and
[1:34:52.480 --> 1:34:56.320]  The one what was the other one I mentioned for your eyes only is the one that looks
[1:34:57.200 --> 1:34:59.920]  Is looks like it has incredibly cheap production values?
[1:35:00.560 --> 1:35:03.280]  Yeah, I think that was one. I guess that's the cheesiest of them. Yeah
[1:35:04.160 --> 1:35:09.440]  Stop the man with the golden gun ends with a climactic fistfight between Roger Moore and
[1:35:10.160 --> 1:35:15.200]  Survey villages who is who is a little person
[1:35:15.200 --> 1:35:22.480]  Right James Bond chasing a little person around the the master bedroom on a yacht. It's it's also got
[1:35:22.800 --> 1:35:28.880]  See that one has let has not only does it a misogyny and it has like racism played off for laughs
[1:35:30.160 --> 1:35:35.600]  Because it's got that that southern sheriff guy in like Thailand
[1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:40.080]  Right, yeah, and some of the things that he says are just awful
[1:35:40.080 --> 1:35:44.880]  It's really bad. It's just terrible and
[1:35:46.320 --> 1:35:49.600]  That was an odd decision to bring that guy back because I
[1:35:50.800 --> 1:35:52.800]  Guess people really
[1:35:52.800 --> 1:35:56.480]  The racist southern sheriff was so popular in
[1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:06.000]  Let's bring him back again. What was he and what was the first one he was in? It was the one with the Paul McCartney theme song
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:10.080]  Living let die. Yeah, yeah, let die
[1:36:11.120 --> 1:36:16.560]  That they had to bring him back who they've brought back when they brought people back is always so he's interesting
[1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:19.280]  Can't believe you don't have Star Wars tickets
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  I'm probably gonna regret that
[1:36:22.560 --> 1:36:24.560]  I'm regretting it already
[1:36:26.800 --> 1:36:29.920]  Anything else trying to think of there's any other news this week. I don't really think so
[1:36:29.920 --> 1:36:40.720]  A little slow did you read did you see the Fraser Spears post? No, uh, what was it on? I've had pro. I've had bro. Yeah. Yeah. What do you say?
[1:36:42.240 --> 1:36:43.760]  Yeah
[1:36:43.760 --> 1:36:45.760]  Let me pull it up here
[1:36:46.320 --> 1:36:48.720]  Can the MacBook Pro replace your iPad?
[1:36:48.720 --> 1:36:58.880]  It's very clever. Oh, that's that's I could tell where he's going. Yeah, uh, the rest of it basically goes
[1:36:59.760 --> 1:37:03.920]  One of those lines. Oh, I should send I'm gonna put this in the show notes too
[1:37:03.920 --> 1:37:07.680]  I don't I forget if I link to this on my site or not sometimes
[1:37:07.680 --> 1:37:13.120]  It's like when I have something too linked to I forget if I ever get to it or not if it's not real important, but there was a
[1:37:13.120 --> 1:37:15.920]  a
[1:37:15.920 --> 1:37:20.320]  This sounds like it's exactly the same sort of thing. It's a review of a
[1:37:21.280 --> 1:37:24.240]  gasoline-powered internal combustion engine car
[1:37:25.120 --> 1:37:27.120]  From the perspective of a Tesla owner
[1:37:31.440 --> 1:37:37.840]  Oh my god, it is so great gas car. I'll put it in the show notes. So you can find it there. Okay
[1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:42.800]  Uh, this sounds like it's of a similar angle, which is what the genius
[1:37:44.720 --> 1:37:46.720]  I mean, I just you've seen a lot of
[1:37:47.520 --> 1:37:53.440]  Posts about I mean, particularly because of things that Tim Cook said about whether or not an iPad can be used for serious work
[1:37:53.440 --> 1:37:55.920]  And you've probably discussed this many times, but
[1:37:55.920 --> 1:38:06.080]  It seems it seems like that was something that we said a long time ago and people are still trying to make this an argument
[1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:14.320]  If you're an artist note-taker or teacher, you're going to really struggle without the native ability to use an apple pencil on the screen
[1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:24.720]  Oh, that's good. That's really good. And how are you going to use it standing up? You can't. It's very difficult to use a MacBook Pro while standing
[1:38:27.600 --> 1:38:30.000]  Downright dangerous to use one when walking around
[1:38:33.040 --> 1:38:39.200]  If you are a road warrior, the MacBook Pro is total lack of cellular connectivity options with the serious hindrance to a proud man
[1:38:39.200 --> 1:38:43.280]  It's really good
[1:38:45.280 --> 1:38:48.000]  All right, that's I don't think there's anything else
[1:38:51.280 --> 1:38:53.280]  Unless you can think of something. No
[1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:59.680]  Well, John's talking movies for another hour. Yeah. No, maybe not. Maybe next. Okay next time
[1:39:01.520 --> 1:39:03.840]  John mulch people can get all the mulch they want
[1:39:03.840 --> 1:39:09.440]  On Twitter and then some that's at mulch
[1:39:10.480 --> 1:39:14.080]  And then they can see your very fine website
[1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:21.600]  Very nice very nice website. Also, it's also very fine, but it's mostly very nice website at very nice website. Don't know
[1:39:21.840 --> 1:39:23.840]  Right
[1:39:24.160 --> 1:39:28.000]  And your podcasts your regular podcasts are
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:34.800]  I do 48 podcasts. You know what snails got you beat. Oh, yeah, no snails. There's no there's no competing with snow
[1:39:35.040 --> 1:39:36.640]  I've got a theory. I wanted to bring it out
[1:39:36.640 --> 1:39:40.560]  He was just on the show and I thought about it and I just didn't want to I don't want to make it uncomfortable
[1:39:40.560 --> 1:39:44.000]  But I did it has occurred to me that snow might be a
[1:39:45.520 --> 1:39:47.520]  Remember that movie the prestige
[1:39:48.320 --> 1:39:52.960]  Yeah, yeah, and I kind of don't want to spoil it for anybody who hasn't watched the prestige
[1:39:52.960 --> 1:39:59.280]  But I'll do it. I haven't seen it. I haven't seen it in a while. So I have to refresh my memory. Yeah, but I think it might be a prestige type scenario
[1:39:59.280 --> 1:40:01.280]  if you know
[1:40:02.720 --> 1:40:06.720]  It'll make sense to people who've seen the prestige. Okay, okay, or should I just spoil it
[1:40:09.600 --> 1:40:11.920]  No, you're not gonna do it now
[1:40:12.880 --> 1:40:17.360]  All right, but then I want to yeah, do you know what though? You don't want you don't want Star Wars spoilers people don't want this
[1:40:17.360 --> 1:40:22.720]  Prestige spoil it right I do think I should say this before I wrap up
[1:40:22.720 --> 1:40:25.080]  I keep forgetting to do stuff like this a lot of times
[1:40:25.080 --> 1:40:27.600]  I want to tell people who listen to show I don't want to talk to you
[1:40:27.600 --> 1:40:30.520]  I get so caught up talking to the guests that I forget to talk to the audience
[1:40:30.520 --> 1:40:33.560]  I want to talk to the audiences for a second and just say that
[1:40:34.560 --> 1:40:36.080]  I'm thinking about talking about
[1:40:36.080 --> 1:40:43.440]  Spector on an upcoming show and it's not gonna quite be the old way that it was with Dan where we really do like a point-by-point review of the movie
[1:40:43.440 --> 1:40:48.640]  But I just stuff I want to talk about it with with that and I haven't talked about skyfall either
[1:40:50.720 --> 1:40:55.520]  But I might and so if you're thinking about you know if you want to listen to it while it's fresh
[1:40:55.520 --> 1:41:02.800]  You should you don't be and you've been procrastinating on going to the theaters to see Spector you should stop and you should your homework
[1:41:02.800 --> 1:41:04.800]  For the talk shows to go see Spector
[1:41:05.440 --> 1:41:10.560]  Okay, I'll see that and then no one will be mad when I actually do it and then they they
[1:41:10.560 --> 1:41:13.720]  They can't is it gonna or is it gonna be with Jonas I?
[1:41:15.600 --> 1:41:19.280]  Haven't decided that's possibility. I mean I did go see it with Jonas
[1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:23.200]  It's a possibility. I haven't decided what to do. It's got to be something different that would certainly be different
[1:41:23.200 --> 1:41:25.200]  But that would that would definitely be different
[1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:31.760]  Not unprecedented. He's been on the show before. Yeah, yeah, it was pretty was pretty young when he did it too because it was back
[1:41:31.760 --> 1:41:33.760]  All the way back with Dan
[1:41:33.760 --> 1:41:35.120]  I
[1:41:35.120 --> 1:41:40.880]  Ever say this I have one time we were at Shake Shack here in Philly and just like a year to it going and a guy came up
[1:41:40.880 --> 1:41:44.280]  And he'd said hey, you you John Gruber and then I was like, yeah
[1:41:44.280 --> 1:41:47.400]  Yeah, yeah, you know, and he's like, oh, I love your podcast and he turned right to Jonas
[1:41:47.400 --> 1:41:52.000]  And goes and you were great on the podcast. That was one of my favorite episodes that I've ever had
[1:41:53.200 --> 1:41:58.680]  And it was a very nice guy and it wasn't weird at all. He did it very very. Oh, good. Very cool. That's nice
[1:41:58.680 --> 1:42:07.000]  Yeah, do you see this thing? Oh, I got one more thing. Do you see the thing with the Amazon there their new thing with the Prime Air drone
[1:42:08.040 --> 1:42:15.080]  No, I'll have to put it in the show notes. It's they have they've released like a YouTube video and they've got
[1:42:17.080 --> 1:42:22.080]  Showing they they're they're their latest generation actual working prototype
[1:42:22.080 --> 1:42:29.800]  Prime delivery drone. Oh, this was their cyber Monday thinners or I guess but it's it's kind of cool
[1:42:29.800 --> 1:42:33.720]  What's cool too? I don't know how close they are to legally being allowed to
[1:42:34.160 --> 1:42:40.080]  To actually use this but they're saying that what is actually shown in the video. It's not like they've it's like a CGI or anything
[1:42:40.080 --> 1:42:43.240]  It's an actual device doing what they're saying is being done in the video
[1:42:44.240 --> 1:42:47.920]  Which in and of itself is cool because it's you know, it's a real thing
[1:42:47.920 --> 1:42:55.200]  But the really cool thing I thought and really interesting is that the video is narrated by Jeremy Clarkson the
[1:42:55.600 --> 1:42:58.000]  top-gear host who oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know
[1:43:00.160 --> 1:43:05.520]  Had a couple of had a couple of drinks in a steak and and punched his producer. I don't
[1:43:07.120 --> 1:43:11.520]  It happens, you know what it does happen. It does. I don't know
[1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:16.160]  I'm I still feel like with that story and you know and then they had a what are that what they call in England
[1:43:16.160 --> 1:43:19.680]  They sacked him because he punched his producer, you know
[1:43:20.720 --> 1:43:24.000]  I say though, you don't know. I don't know the right. I've ever gotten a full story on that
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:26.880]  There are times when somebody needs a punch. So who knows
[1:43:27.920 --> 1:43:29.920]  You do not know what he was driven to
[1:43:30.080 --> 1:43:34.960]  You don't know but it's it makes for a great video though because obviously part of what made that whole thing
[1:43:35.040 --> 1:43:39.680]  Sensational is that top gear is a well-deserved and much beloved TV show
[1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:45.840]  And this video is sort of done with that same sort of style and you know
[1:43:45.840 --> 1:43:50.080]  It just has it's not just because he's hosting it. It just has that same sort of feel and touch
[1:43:50.560 --> 1:43:54.640]  And it really it's it's something I never even considered when I found out that
[1:43:55.360 --> 1:44:00.640]  Amazon had won the bidding to to get Jeremy Clarkson to do it. I guess it's still as yet unnamed
[1:44:01.920 --> 1:44:03.920]  Car show for
[1:44:03.760 --> 1:44:04.800]  Prime
[1:44:04.800 --> 1:44:08.480]  Video or whatever they call their their video service for for subscribers
[1:44:09.200 --> 1:44:09.840]  Um
[1:44:10.080 --> 1:44:13.760]  When they did that I thought okay, so now they're gonna get that what used to be called top gear
[1:44:13.760 --> 1:44:16.960]  They're gonna get it, you know, and you have to be a prime subscriber to see it
[1:44:17.200 --> 1:44:23.120]  I'm looking forward to seeing it didn't really occur to me that they would take use of that and sort of turn him into like an in-house
[1:44:23.760 --> 1:44:25.440]  spokesperson
[1:44:25.440 --> 1:44:29.840]  And the same video team and to be able to do that which is incredibly
[1:44:30.400 --> 1:44:36.560]  Valuable because it's so good. It's so well done. I'll put the video in the show note, but it's it's really really good
[1:44:36.560 --> 1:44:39.840]  It's not just interesting like wow they have a robot that can fly through the air and drop
[1:44:39.840 --> 1:44:47.840]  Packages at your house, which is a cool idea, but I really think it's fascinating to me now that Amazon has the top gear
[1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:50.400]  Host and production team as an in-house
[1:44:51.360 --> 1:44:57.440]  Marketing team like it and really ups the value of their stuff. There's a I don't know if there's a rumor or what but their
[1:44:58.560 --> 1:45:00.880]  Amazon Prime video might is now
[1:45:01.680 --> 1:45:04.240]  Coming to the Apple TV. Yeah. Yeah. I should yeah
[1:45:04.240 --> 1:45:09.040]  Yeah, if we prepared for the show. Yeah, right. Right. Right. We should get a talk about that for an hour
[1:45:10.480 --> 1:45:16.240]  Right, I will just drop that at the end long story short somebody wrote the Amazon to complain about the fact that there's no
[1:45:16.640 --> 1:45:20.080]  Prime video app on Apple TV and they got an answer
[1:45:20.480 --> 1:45:23.120]  That didn't seem to go through like any sort of official channels
[1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:26.480]  But somebody said Amazon wrote back and said that we're working on it
[1:45:27.600 --> 1:45:30.080]  Which if true is good to know
[1:45:30.080 --> 1:45:34.560]  But I took that with a huge grain of salt because it did not seem to come from
[1:45:35.280 --> 1:45:40.080]  It just didn't feel right to visually. Yeah, it seemed like somebody who was just like well like, you know
[1:45:40.880 --> 1:45:46.320]  We're working on it. We have if we have an iPad app. I guess we're having Apple. I don't know could happen
[1:45:47.360 --> 1:45:51.760]  But anyway, who knows I guess it's more hope though than we've had before so it would be nice
[1:45:52.480 --> 1:45:55.200]  Because there's good stuff on Amazon that you know is exclusive
[1:45:55.600 --> 1:45:56.640]  Right
[1:45:56.640 --> 1:46:01.520]  Um, what do they call this thing prime prime error video with Jeremy Clarkson
[1:46:02.240 --> 1:46:04.240]  So I'll put that in the show notes too. That's pretty good
[1:46:04.240 --> 1:46:33.040]  All right, John. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you talk to you soon. Okay. Bye. Bye
