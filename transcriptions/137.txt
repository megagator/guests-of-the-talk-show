[00:00.000 --> 00:04.520]  We've got rumors to talk about I love rumors. I know this is you know what I was thinking about
[00:04.520 --> 00:11.240]  I think this is sort of like I think this is the the the fall season here the you know, November December
[00:11.240 --> 00:14.160]  this is like peak rumor season because
[00:15.040 --> 00:20.840]  Nothing's coming out soon. Mm-hmm, but there are you know, Apple must be working on stuff for next year and beyond
[00:21.360 --> 00:24.360]  And so now is the time when the rumors start coming out
[00:24.360 --> 00:29.080]  the big one that I've seen the one that's got everybody in a tizzy is
[00:30.520 --> 00:37.000]  You know which one it is, right? Yes, I do. Which one is it? It's the the headphone jack thing exactly, right?
[00:40.680 --> 00:42.000]  That the
[00:42.000 --> 00:48.900]  Was a mini is a mini jack, right? Yeah, so the standard 3.5 millimeter headphone jack that's been in every
[00:49.360 --> 00:51.360]  device that I'm aware of
[00:51.720 --> 00:53.720]  for a long time
[00:53.720 --> 00:56.320]  Is supposedly it says one report
[00:59.840 --> 01:06.160]  Who had it originally here, let's see it was a Japanese rumor site right at some chapter of well not a rumor site, but
[01:06.720 --> 01:09.920]  Well, I guess there's a rumor site if it published so Mac rumors
[01:11.840 --> 01:13.840]  Right, it's
[01:13.920 --> 01:15.920]  Mac Oda Cara
[01:17.040 --> 01:20.380]  Which Mac rumors described as often reliable
[01:20.380 --> 01:22.380]  Often
[01:23.540 --> 01:28.900]  Well in this scheme of like publishing these things from the supply chain in Asia
[01:29.220 --> 01:34.620]  Often reliable if you say it with a straight face is actually high praise high praise, right?
[01:36.340 --> 01:38.340]  But it was it it was not
[01:38.860 --> 01:40.620]  sourced from
[01:40.620 --> 01:42.260]  digitimes, right
[01:42.260 --> 01:48.900]  No, it's there. They're so they didn't get it from digitimes. No their report cited a quote reliable source
[01:48.900 --> 01:50.900]  okay, and I
[01:52.900 --> 01:55.240]  Guess so it says here's here's Mac rumors
[01:56.340 --> 01:57.740]  translation of it or
[01:57.740 --> 02:02.540]  interpretation I guess I should say the report citing a quote reliable source and quote
[02:02.860 --> 02:08.980]  claims the new same-sized lightning connector will support lightning equipped and Bluetooth headphones and have a
[02:09.820 --> 02:15.860]  DAC or a digital to audio converter for backwards compatibility with wired
[02:15.860 --> 02:19.740]  Headphones using a standard 3.5 millimeters
[02:20.420 --> 02:22.420]  stereo jack a
[02:22.660 --> 02:26.460]  3.5 millimeter to lightning adapter would be required
[02:29.340 --> 02:33.620]  So the I guess the gist of it the way I interpret this and I don't think it's entirely clear the way I just
[02:34.140 --> 02:39.820]  Interpret it is that they're not replacing the headphone jack with a new proprietary jack
[02:39.820 --> 02:43.460]  They are simply getting rid of the headphone jack and you'll just have to plug in
[02:43.460 --> 02:46.460]  And you'll just have to plug in to the lightning
[02:47.140 --> 02:49.780]  Adapter that's already there or use Bluetooth
[02:52.300 --> 02:58.600]  Or use Bluetooth, but I don't see why this report says that the new lightning connector has anything to do with
[03:00.020 --> 03:04.820]  Bluetooth though, it doesn't seem like no idea. It doesn't make that doesn't mean I think that's a mistake
[03:04.820 --> 03:06.740]  That's what I mean about it being a little confusing
[03:06.740 --> 03:13.380]  I think what they mean is that you will you know, your options will be to either plug in headphones with a lightning connector a
[03:15.060 --> 03:19.020]  B use a new dongle that doesn't exist yet
[03:19.020 --> 03:24.260]  that'll be a you'll stick it in the lightning port and then you'll stick regular headphones into this dongle or
[03:24.940 --> 03:26.940]  C you'll switch to Bluetooth
[03:27.700 --> 03:29.700]  headphones or
[03:30.060 --> 03:33.420]  D you'll throw your phone in the river and
[03:33.420 --> 03:35.420]  Go
[03:35.700 --> 03:37.700]  Back to blackberry. I
[03:38.980 --> 03:40.980]  Guess the other option would be to
[03:41.460 --> 03:47.340]  This would be a great time for blackberry to come out and proclaim their support for the the 3.5 millimeter
[03:49.380 --> 03:51.380]  This
[03:51.420 --> 03:53.180]  Another option and I love it
[03:53.180 --> 03:58.860]  I really do I deeply enjoy it when other people's small children do this on let's say a train or something is you could just
[03:58.860 --> 04:04.460]  Use the speakers on the device. That's
[04:04.620 --> 04:07.420]  Perfect pumped up to a loud enough volume to to you know
[04:07.700 --> 04:13.060]  Over here overtake the sound of the train or the train or the jet airliner that you're riding on
[04:15.860 --> 04:17.860]  Who needs headphones
[04:18.900 --> 04:23.940]  So but the whole I mean the whole thing so this this is portrayed as which you know
[04:24.140 --> 04:26.980]  Well, first of all the this is not the first time we've heard this
[04:26.980 --> 04:34.380]  No, it's rumor. Well, I mean, I think this this flow is floated also right before the the iPhone 6 I
[04:35.260 --> 04:40.060]  Remember correctly. I think it started it started though when lightning
[04:40.740 --> 04:44.740]  Debuted because lightning has always supported audio like you can go and you can buy
[04:45.740 --> 04:50.860]  They exist today. In fact that Phillips there's a pair of Phillips ones here in the screenshot that
[04:50.860 --> 04:58.620]  That Mac rumors has you can buy lightning connector headphones today like the existing lightning port can support audio
[04:58.620 --> 05:01.220]  So you can do that right now today. That's not like a new thing
[05:01.220 --> 05:05.900]  I think that what they're saying and so in terms of what they're saying about the this
[05:06.500 --> 05:10.220]  Soap-called iPhone 7 having a new like next generation lightning
[05:11.140 --> 05:13.140]  Jack, you know the female side
[05:15.620 --> 05:18.180]  Would be the that it includes a digital audio
[05:18.180 --> 05:20.180]  converter I
[05:20.540 --> 05:24.220]  Don't know though why the dongle wouldn't do the digital audio conversion
[05:24.620 --> 05:29.500]  But anyway, that's what they're saying. So I think right now so this is and I could be wrong
[05:29.500 --> 05:30.940]  I could be definitely wrong about this
[05:30.940 --> 05:36.540]  This could be something that maybe the dongle would work on our existing iPhones, but I think what they're saying is that?
[05:37.540 --> 05:38.940]  to use
[05:38.940 --> 05:43.640]  Standard headphones through the dongle and the lightning would require this iPhone 7 lightning
[05:44.020 --> 05:47.120]  Port because it would include the digital audio converter inside
[05:47.120 --> 05:50.240]  Okay, but otherwise, I don't think anything any of this is new
[05:50.720 --> 05:57.160]  You know the fact that lightning can handle audio isn't definitely not new you can buy these headphones today and use them on your phone
[05:57.160 --> 05:59.920]  Today and that the rumors started as soon as that became clear
[06:01.720 --> 06:07.380]  Because why else would they do it unless they plan to get rid of the 3.5 at some point, yeah
[06:09.000 --> 06:13.440]  There was also there was a there's a also a smaller Jack than the 3.5
[06:13.440 --> 06:17.280]  a millimeter Jack that used to be used in Japan
[06:17.800 --> 06:21.880]  Mmm for years because I remember I bought when I was in Japan
[06:21.880 --> 06:25.320]  I accidentally bought a pair of headphones and took it home and it was like
[06:25.960 --> 06:29.680]  went to put them on my like my walkman or whatever it was and I was like
[06:30.560 --> 06:32.560]  This is not this is not right
[06:32.960 --> 06:39.320]  But but again, but I think the reason the reason it was exactly that though was that was for smaller
[06:39.320 --> 06:44.320]  So the smaller devices there's so many jokes
[06:47.120 --> 06:54.320]  That I can't think I can't I can't that's good I can't glad I can't think of any jokes stem from this
[06:54.640 --> 06:58.000]  No, there could be there's nothing there's nothing to be said
[06:59.840 --> 07:06.960]  Anyway people are some people are very very upset about this they are and and however much
[07:06.960 --> 07:08.960]  controversy there was
[07:09.480 --> 07:13.440]  When Apple switched from 30 the 30-pin dock connector to the lightning?
[07:15.080 --> 07:22.000]  Adapter and people accused Apple of you know doing this just to get people to buy more more cape, you know
[07:22.000 --> 07:23.880]  Everything you know that it was a money grab
[07:23.880 --> 07:28.680]  this is the accusation that it was a money grab and I think you and I have talked about this multiple times that it was
[07:28.680 --> 07:30.680]  a money grab and
[07:31.560 --> 07:34.760]  They wanted to sell new cables they wanted you to buy new docks
[07:34.760 --> 07:41.840]  They wanted you to buy their little I think it was $19 the little just the little adapter that lets you switch a 30-pin
[07:41.880 --> 07:47.780]  Thing into a lightning thing. I think it was 19 wasn't that much or was that the headphone price? No
[07:47.780 --> 07:53.800]  Yeah, that was no that's probably right. That's probably right. Although maybe it was 20. I had the headphones or something like 30. Yeah
[07:56.960 --> 08:02.320]  And I I laugh about this I laugh that people are upset and I but I understand the frustration
[08:02.320 --> 08:04.800]  You know, I I just laugh at how
[08:05.840 --> 08:08.400]  How hard people take this? Mm-hmm
[08:08.760 --> 08:14.440]  Well, yeah, so the the thing that it's portrayed as a trade-off for is is getting a thinner iPhone
[08:15.080 --> 08:17.560]  Right. Yeah, then that's the only
[08:18.280 --> 08:21.920]  So it and everyone says I don't want a thinner iPhone
[08:22.880 --> 08:24.800]  which I
[08:24.800 --> 08:31.240]  Mean, I don't I don't feel like I need a thinner iPhone, but in fairness you haven't seen a thinner iPhone
[08:31.240 --> 08:32.720]  No
[08:32.720 --> 08:34.840]  You might you might really like it thinner iPhone
[08:35.680 --> 08:38.440]  Well, and as oh man, here it is
[08:38.440 --> 08:42.440]  So I looked it up on the store dot apple.com the lightning to 30-pin adapter
[08:42.440 --> 08:49.040]  Not a cable just the little adapter right now. It sells for $29. So I think it's maybe it's always been $29. Yeah
[08:50.720 --> 08:52.720]  And the
[08:54.160 --> 08:58.640]  Lightning to 30-pin adapter that's more of a cable is 30
[08:58.640 --> 09:00.120]  30
[09:00.120 --> 09:02.120]  $39, it's got a a
[09:02.760 --> 09:10.880]  0.2 meter cable. So it's it's a rather like a 20 centimeter cable and that's that's $39
[09:15.000 --> 09:21.320]  So I do get the frustration there it does seem to me it seems very clear to me and
[09:21.640 --> 09:26.340]  and it just seems funny that it always comes up when you're on the show that there's a sort of aspect of
[09:26.340 --> 09:28.980]  You know, let's spend Tim Cook's money
[09:29.980 --> 09:36.100]  You know that these things should be cheaper and that whatever money they make from them
[09:36.100 --> 09:41.420]  They would gain in goodwill by making them if not giving them away
[09:41.420 --> 09:48.620]  You know coming as close to giving them away as they can that if they sold them it cost and presumably it costs a lot
[09:48.620 --> 09:51.340]  Less than $29 to make this dongle. Yeah
[09:52.180 --> 09:54.440]  It would they would make up for it in goodwill
[09:54.440 --> 09:57.800]  Right, they're not interested. They're not interested in that
[09:59.480 --> 10:03.080]  Well, I think it would be it would be you would make the pill easier to swallow it
[10:03.720 --> 10:05.720]  You know, I don't know that people would be
[10:06.200 --> 10:07.560]  completely
[10:07.560 --> 10:11.560]  Cuz if you're if you're heavily invested in in that jack and I think you know
[10:11.560 --> 10:17.240]  I mean, I think some people are I'm not I wouldn't say that I am particularly I do have many headphones
[10:17.880 --> 10:22.000]  that I wear with that jack, but I mostly use them for podcasting and
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.680]  And so I'm plugging them into a microphone instead of plugging it into my my iPhone
[10:28.800 --> 10:31.760]  and you and I mostly and I'm you know, I'm a
[10:32.560 --> 10:34.880]  I'm not an audiophile. So I mostly use
[10:35.600 --> 10:41.600]  Apple's headphones and when I'm using my iPhone and I and then I also have a pair of Bluetooth
[10:42.240 --> 10:44.960]  Headphones that I use for exercising. Yeah
[10:45.680 --> 10:47.680]  So it wouldn't really change my life that much
[10:47.680 --> 10:54.160]  It's a it's just I just find it a fun thing to talk about on the show because it is it
[10:54.960 --> 11:00.160]  It's such a petty little thing in the grand scheme of things if you really think about it, right?
[11:00.160 --> 11:04.800]  It's just not that big a deal in the life of an iPhone user
[11:05.440 --> 11:12.960]  But there's so many like implications of a change like this that it makes it fun to think about the trade-offs on Apple's part
[11:12.960 --> 11:17.440]  So let's tackle some more of these implications of the the audio jack
[11:18.160 --> 11:24.000]  So one of them like you said that the idea would be that that Apple would be motivated to do this
[11:24.720 --> 11:31.600]  Because it would allow them to make the device thinner that at this point 3.5 millimeters just for the port alone
[11:32.320 --> 11:34.320]  is
[11:34.400 --> 11:39.600]  Significant, you know, it's it's it's a constraint given the how the performance of the device is
[11:39.600 --> 11:47.360]  You know, it's it's it's a constraint given the how the millimeter thickness of these devices now that obviously there's existence proof
[11:47.440 --> 11:54.640]  That they can make thinner devices that still have that port like the the iPod touch the current generation iPod touch is like a full
[11:55.520 --> 11:58.000]  millimeter thinner than the iPhone
[11:58.720 --> 12:05.680]  Success is it really? Yeah. Okay, actually I have them both here, but they're in cases or almost so
[12:05.680 --> 12:11.200]  It's like it's like the iPhone 6s is like six point nine millimeters and then iPod touch is like six point one
[12:12.640 --> 12:14.560]  and still has
[12:14.560 --> 12:17.600]  a standard audio port and the
[12:18.960 --> 12:27.200]  The iPod nano is even thinner still and still has the the regular audio port
[12:28.800 --> 12:35.120]  But as some people on twitter have pointed out like if you look at the iPod nano the the full work, you know
[12:35.120 --> 12:41.840]  The the length it takes the depth that the headphone jack has to go into the port to fit
[12:42.480 --> 12:46.480]  It doesn't actually go underneath the screen at all. There's like a chin, you know
[12:46.480 --> 12:52.160]  So it's not it's not like it also has to fit underneath the screen where I think it does on on the iPhone
[12:53.440 --> 12:55.920]  So thinness is definitely certainly one of the angles
[12:56.480 --> 13:01.600]  I don't think it means that they couldn't make an iPhone 7 that's thinner and keep the jack though
[13:01.600 --> 13:07.520]  It's just probably makes it easier because it's one less thing to put in and I think I think that the depth of the the
[13:07.680 --> 13:11.920]  Jack is actually more of a problem than the thickness of it. The fact that the standard audio port has to go
[13:12.560 --> 13:14.560]  So far in
[13:15.360 --> 13:17.120]  God this show could be torn apart
[13:19.120 --> 13:21.280]  To create a political attack ad against me
[13:21.280 --> 13:28.240]  Um, here's here's another like what what do you think would happen if they said we're taking out
[13:29.280 --> 13:33.280]  We're taking out the audio jack, uh, because we want to put more battery in
[13:34.880 --> 13:42.080]  That would be an interesting thing for them to say so we took out. Yeah, we took out the the audio jack and you'll get another
[13:43.520 --> 13:46.560]  Hour and a half of battery that would be interesting
[13:46.560 --> 13:51.040]  It would be an interesting way to justify it instead of saying it's going to be even thinner
[13:51.600 --> 13:59.360]  Right because saying that it's even thinner it really only seems to satisfy apple's internal obsession with device thinness
[14:00.080 --> 14:03.920]  and and it could well be that it's more than just the
[14:05.360 --> 14:11.040]  The taste of johnny iv and his team and whoever else is there that they want these devices that they value thinness
[14:11.040 --> 14:17.360]  Over the battery life that could be gained by just making the device thicker or keeping it the thinness
[14:18.080 --> 14:24.560]  of the instead of making it as thin as they possibly can to get the same battery life as the previous generation what if they kept
[14:24.880 --> 14:26.880]  the same thickness as
[14:27.280 --> 14:28.320]  the
[14:28.320 --> 14:32.400]  device thickness as the previous generation but use their newfound ability to
[14:32.860 --> 14:36.560]  Miniturize and thin things to just create more room for them to be able to get the same
[14:36.560 --> 14:42.400]  Use their newfound ability to miniaturize and thin things to just create more room for a battery, right?
[14:42.640 --> 14:46.960]  That's the that's the the thing that some people a lot of people seem to want apple to do
[14:47.520 --> 14:50.160]  It could well be that apple has internal marketing
[14:53.040 --> 14:57.920]  Like data like you know or that that suggests if not proves that
[14:58.560 --> 15:03.600]  given the choice in a store people will choose the thinner device and that there might be
[15:03.600 --> 15:10.400]  As much as many of us think that people would be happier with the thicker device that gets longer battery life
[15:10.560 --> 15:15.760]  Apple might have some knowledge to know that at the point of sale people are going to buy the thinner one
[15:16.480 --> 15:21.200]  And it would expose them to it. I wouldn't be yeah, I wouldn't be surprised by that really because
[15:22.080 --> 15:24.160]  I don't think it's like it's not like this for me anymore
[15:24.160 --> 15:28.960]  But that used to be the one thing what I looked at years ago when I looked at android phones. I thought
[15:28.960 --> 15:33.600]  Wow, it would be really cool to have a phone. That was that then yeah, samsung has one, you know
[15:33.600 --> 15:39.360]  It's one of the galaxies. It's not the flagship because the flagship one has higher specs and can't be that thin
[15:39.360 --> 15:45.120]  But there's one of the current galaxy phones somebody I saw somebody claim is only 5.9 millimeters
[15:45.440 --> 15:48.640]  So samsung's, you know in a race for a thinness, too
[15:48.960 --> 15:53.680]  And it don't forget that these are the sort of decisions that when apple makes now for next year
[15:53.680 --> 15:58.560]  If they stick to the current plan of using the same hardware for two years, you know basic hardware
[15:59.120 --> 16:03.920]  Profile for two years with a seven next year and then a 7s the year after that
[16:06.080 --> 16:09.280]  That if they make a mistake here and go thicker and
[16:09.920 --> 16:16.240]  Samsung goes way thinner and it proves to be a hit they could be the same sort of thing that happened with larger screen sizes
[16:16.240 --> 16:21.360]  A few years ago where larger screen sizes clearly were selling phones
[16:21.360 --> 16:27.680]  and you know, there was even we've it is one of those rare things that we have proof of because it came out in
[16:28.640 --> 16:32.240]  The court case one of the court cases was samsung where there was like an email
[16:32.240 --> 16:36.320]  I think might have even been from schiller himself, but it was certainly from somebody on schiller's team
[16:36.720 --> 16:38.720]  there was an internal email at apple that said
[16:40.320 --> 16:44.400]  People some people want what we don't have larger screen phones
[16:46.160 --> 16:48.800]  And they can't just scramble and
[16:48.800 --> 16:54.800]  You know come out with a new phone next month with a bigger screen. These things are you know have two year lead times
[16:55.520 --> 16:57.520]  Maybe even longer
[16:58.560 --> 16:59.680]  So if apples, you know
[16:59.680 --> 17:04.720]  thanks, or it maybe even knows that then this sells and that and they certainly know that samsung is
[17:05.280 --> 17:10.800]  Capable of making devices that are thin if not other, you know companies too. They may not want to you know
[17:11.440 --> 17:14.480]  They may not want to do this even if they also know that
[17:14.480 --> 17:22.000]  Customer satisfaction wise after they've already purchased a phone if it had the longer battery life of a thicker thing people would be happier
[17:23.760 --> 17:28.960]  Yeah, it's it is strange though to see lots of people saying
[17:30.960 --> 17:35.200]  That they don't want something that you know, I mean I obviously this is presented as uh,
[17:35.200 --> 17:38.560]  No, you got to get rid of this in order to get that if they came out and just said it was going to be
[17:38.560 --> 17:40.560]  A thinner phone you'd probably go slightly different
[17:40.560 --> 17:44.560]  Reaction without the you're going to lose the headphone jack
[17:45.360 --> 17:47.040]  but
[17:47.040 --> 17:52.400]  it seems like it used to be like here are the things that you know seems like they might be coming in the next iphone and
[17:52.400 --> 17:54.400]  Everyone would be
[17:54.400 --> 17:57.280]  Pretty excited about those things with the exception of lightning. Yeah
[17:58.720 --> 18:04.800]  And I feel like like I feel like I don't I don't necessarily I don't feel like i'm that excited about a thinner phone at this point
[18:05.360 --> 18:06.400]  and
[18:06.400 --> 18:10.880]  I you know, we've had this discussion before too. I would rather have a smaller phone
[18:10.880 --> 18:13.040]  Yeah, it may not just be about thinness though
[18:13.040 --> 18:18.320]  I so I I say it could be it could help and and maybe it would help with battery life too
[18:18.320 --> 18:21.040]  but there are other factors too like even if you could just
[18:21.280 --> 18:26.640]  Just just concede for the moment that they could go as thin as they want to and still keep the other jack that whatever
[18:26.880 --> 18:33.280]  Thinness, they're they're planning for for the iphone 7 it could accommodate a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
[18:33.280 --> 18:36.480]  It could accommodate a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
[18:36.880 --> 18:42.640]  I don't know if that's true or not, but let's just concede it for the moment. It's also another point of you know
[18:43.120 --> 18:45.120]  potential water damage
[18:45.120 --> 18:48.800]  It's a you know, one less port is one lens one less thing to
[18:49.600 --> 18:51.280]  um
[18:51.280 --> 18:55.200]  To have to you know, try to protect against you know water getting in there
[18:55.760 --> 18:57.120]  um
[18:57.120 --> 19:05.040]  Having two ports definitely takes more space inside the device than one port that does both things. I mean, that's just
[19:05.680 --> 19:08.320]  I mean, that's just like an obvious fact
[19:08.640 --> 19:11.440]  So in other ways other than thinness it might you know
[19:11.520 --> 19:16.160]  Like you said batteries one life who knows what else they could use that space for but they could certainly you know
[19:16.240 --> 19:18.640]  They certainly take advantage of every bit of space that they can
[19:19.520 --> 19:21.520]  Yeah
[19:21.520 --> 19:28.640]  Um, I don't know the problem is like is charging I mean everybody's you know, right it's out already
[19:28.720 --> 19:29.920]  but like when you're
[19:29.920 --> 19:34.720]  And I do this I do this sometimes where I put the headphones in and charging when i'm at my desk and listening to something
[19:35.520 --> 19:37.520]  and
[19:39.120 --> 19:41.120]  Having to like find a dongle and
[19:41.840 --> 19:46.720]  Yeah, nobody wants nobody really wants a dongle. Uh, like a y adapter dongle
[19:46.720 --> 19:52.720]  Right. Yeah, the idea would be that even even if you're on board like on the one hand if you want to stick with your
[19:53.440 --> 19:58.160]  Beloved old pair of headphones that has a 3.5 millimeter jack
[19:58.960 --> 20:02.000]  Then you need a dongle, you know to go 3.5 to
[20:04.000 --> 20:05.200]  Lightning
[20:05.200 --> 20:11.600]  And it can't be a tiny little dongle because we know how long the adapter is on the headphones
[20:12.560 --> 20:14.560]  and
[20:14.560 --> 20:19.360]  Uh, like i'm looking at it right now. Yeah, that's you know at a minimum like it's you know
[20:20.000 --> 20:22.000]  At least what half an inch?
[20:22.400 --> 20:23.440]  um
[20:23.440 --> 20:24.720]  Not that small
[20:24.720 --> 20:30.720]  So you got this thing sticking out of your phone plus the actual cable itself from the headphone that sticks out from the phone
[20:30.720 --> 20:32.480]  So it's you know
[20:32.480 --> 20:33.440]  cumbersome
[20:33.440 --> 20:35.760]  but even if you're willing to go on board with
[20:36.400 --> 20:41.520]  The a new pair of lightning headphones, which presumably apple would ship with the device and other, you know
[20:41.520 --> 20:45.280]  Companies are already making if you want to charge and use those at the same times
[20:45.280 --> 20:49.920]  You'd still need an adapter so that you could have two lightning inputs one for charging one for the headphone
[20:50.880 --> 20:52.880]  And i'm not even sure if that would work
[20:53.280 --> 20:54.320]  yeah
[20:54.320 --> 20:55.840]  unless you have a
[20:55.840 --> 20:57.840]  inductive charging right and
[20:58.160 --> 21:02.560]  I fully concede like one of the things this is just one of those things where I just i'll just
[21:02.800 --> 21:06.640]  I just like to sit here and think about it from apple's perspective and I don't really have
[21:06.640 --> 21:12.640]  strong feelings one way or the other like me trying to justify it and thinking of the reasons apple might want to do it isn't
[21:12.640 --> 21:14.640]  Me saying I think this is a great idea
[21:16.960 --> 21:19.680]  I'm not sure. I think it's interesting because there's so many trade-offs
[21:19.680 --> 21:26.240]  But the the needing to charge or wanting to charge while you listen with headphones is absolutely positively a real thing
[21:26.240 --> 21:30.800]  I see my son doing it all the time his device his devices seem to all live
[21:30.800 --> 21:37.200]  In in the like the best charge they ever seem to get puts him in the yellow
[21:37.520 --> 21:39.360]  Yeah, I think hank is like it's similar. Yeah
[21:40.880 --> 21:46.480]  I mean so even just since this rumor popped up i've spotted jonas at least twice
[21:46.880 --> 21:53.600]  Using his I think it was both times. It was his ipad but using his ipad with headphones watching video while it was charging
[21:54.160 --> 21:57.760]  So I fully concede that is not just something people want to do
[21:57.760 --> 22:04.880]  People want to do uh, it's something people like my son would have to do other than to stare at a black iphone
[22:05.440 --> 22:09.600]  Let it go out. Yeah, just just stare at the black screen of a dead ipad
[22:10.240 --> 22:12.400]  Uh, so I don't know how apple solves it
[22:12.480 --> 22:18.080]  Maybe the answer is of course that they don't and that this whole story is bullshit and they're not getting rid of the separate jack
[22:18.400 --> 22:24.480]  Well, that's the and that's the other thing that's kind of ridiculous about this the whole thing because it's it's it has really been widely
[22:24.480 --> 22:29.140]  discussed and it is all based off this one, right
[22:29.940 --> 22:31.460]  this one source
[22:31.460 --> 22:37.380]  Like so inside apple, there's somebody, you know some team that clearly already knows the answer to this
[22:37.620 --> 22:40.660]  I think that this is one of those decisions that's already been made
[22:41.460 --> 22:45.140]  And they're either they're laughing one way or the other
[22:46.580 --> 22:51.940]  Either way, they're laughing like if there is an iphone if there is a regular
[22:51.940 --> 22:58.820]  or good old-fashioned 3.5 millimeter headphone jack on the iphone 7 next year the team inside apple is laughing at all of the
[22:59.460 --> 23:04.740]  Thought that we're all putting into this and all the consternation out there on the on the web and if there's not they're
[23:05.140 --> 23:07.140]  They're at least chuckling at the
[23:07.140 --> 23:10.600]  People who are saying there's no way they would do this. It would make everybody too furious
[23:13.940 --> 23:15.940]  Yeah, they're
[23:16.100 --> 23:18.580]  They're no stranger to controversy. So I don't think
[23:18.580 --> 23:24.180]  It's funny though because it is clearly controversial and it's like there's something about apple that makes them
[23:24.660 --> 23:27.780]  Un, you know, one of the ways that apple is clearly different than other companies
[23:27.860 --> 23:30.420]  Is they're the only company whoever seems to face these things?
[23:31.060 --> 23:33.060]  I never see and
[23:33.780 --> 23:38.020]  For one thing that other companies tend to keep legacy ports around
[23:38.740 --> 23:42.580]  Almost as long as they can as opposed to looking for a way to get rid of legacy ports
[23:42.580 --> 23:45.220]  They look for a way to keep them going as long as they can
[23:45.220 --> 23:47.700]  Yeah, it's like they don't want to lose that one extra sale
[23:48.420 --> 23:50.420]  And and then even when they do
[23:50.660 --> 23:53.220]  I don't know how they escape the criticism like
[23:53.860 --> 23:56.580]  android phones like iphones have gone from
[23:57.940 --> 24:01.300]  and and if you for the sake of an argument if you just count the
[24:01.780 --> 24:06.500]  iPod as like a like a sibling predecessor to the iphone
[24:07.140 --> 24:09.140]  They've gone through two ports
[24:09.620 --> 24:11.620]  ever 30 pin
[24:11.620 --> 24:13.620]  starting with the original ipod
[24:13.620 --> 24:15.620]  to
[24:16.100 --> 24:18.660]  No, the first the first one had firewire, right?
[24:18.660 --> 24:22.340]  So well, it was the same on the fire on the 30 pin end
[24:22.660 --> 24:26.500]  But it was all only firewire on the other end, but we'll call you know, you needed a new cable
[24:26.660 --> 24:30.180]  So we'll call that the same. Wait. Wait. No, it was a
[24:30.740 --> 24:33.380]  No, the original ipod was firewire on both ends
[24:34.020 --> 24:39.300]  Oh my god, you're right. Yeah, you're right. You're right. Yeah. I'm totally wrong on that. So there are all right
[24:39.300 --> 24:45.080]  So here's the changes they've gone through from including all the ipods one. The first one was firewire firewire
[24:45.620 --> 24:47.880]  Then they went 30 pin to firewire
[24:48.500 --> 24:50.500]  And then it was 30 pin to usb
[24:51.300 --> 24:57.140]  But if you just made like a clock radio that had the 30 pin thing, it would work with whatever your your ipod was
[24:57.780 --> 24:59.780]  and then lightning
[25:00.020 --> 25:04.580]  Other devices the ones that just use like usb went through I forget the names of them
[25:04.660 --> 25:07.460]  But there's like sort of the the thicker mini
[25:07.460 --> 25:09.240]  USB
[25:09.240 --> 25:14.600]  Then there's the thinner new micro usb. It was like there was like mini usb micro usb
[25:15.160 --> 25:20.760]  And now usb c which is nice because it's like lightning and you can you can't put it in upside down
[25:20.760 --> 25:26.440]  It works both directions for some reason when they switch they don't get they don't get the controversy. Yeah
[25:27.080 --> 25:28.120]  Yeah
[25:28.120 --> 25:33.240]  That always used to make me laugh because people in the android side would make fun of apple for for like oh your ports
[25:33.240 --> 25:35.240]  No, your ports match and I was like
[25:35.240 --> 25:37.240]  Yeah, another two years
[25:38.120 --> 25:41.400]  And it's like I I know some people are saying
[25:41.880 --> 25:46.760]  That would say well no, but apple's the only one who tries to gouge you for 29 for an adapter
[25:47.320 --> 25:48.680]  um
[25:48.680 --> 25:53.640]  but you know in short order you can go to you know, amazon or
[25:55.080 --> 26:00.920]  Mono price for example and get a high quality adapter that's not made by apple for a reasonable price
[26:00.920 --> 26:07.960]  So, I mean you can make the transition and that's those are the only places that people on android buy cables and stuff like that
[26:08.920 --> 26:10.440]  Yeah, so the fact that apple's first party
[26:11.320 --> 26:14.840]  Adapters and dongles are seemingly exorbitantly priced
[26:15.560 --> 26:20.120]  It doesn't really make things worse for anybody who's sensitive to that and just goes to amazon
[26:20.600 --> 26:23.400]  I mean, it's not like amazon is some obscure company that nobody's heard of
[26:27.640 --> 26:29.240]  Is it
[26:29.240 --> 26:32.680]  It might be slightly cheaper to get usb adapters
[26:33.320 --> 26:37.720]  Right because because the other ones I mean the other ones somebody has to license from apple, right?
[26:37.800 --> 26:39.800]  They have to license one end from apple
[26:40.280 --> 26:44.280]  Right, but there's other there's other still it still gets down to the point where it's okay, you know
[26:44.280 --> 26:49.400]  We're still talking about like 10 bucks. There's other hassles involved though like that i've and they're all reasonable
[26:49.480 --> 26:55.880]  I mean, these are all reasonable complaints. They're actual truth, you know, the actual truth. They're obvious but like the problem where
[26:56.600 --> 26:57.640]  um
[26:57.640 --> 27:01.400]  like in a two-person household, uh where
[27:02.200 --> 27:03.560]  person a
[27:03.560 --> 27:04.440]  uh
[27:04.440 --> 27:08.600]  Has or at one point they both you both have phones with the same port on it
[27:08.680 --> 27:12.120]  And then one of you upgrades to a new one and it has a different port and now
[27:12.360 --> 27:17.480]  All the various places like in that kitchen or wherever you might share a little charging station
[27:18.040 --> 27:24.440]  Now you can't just use the same cable and you've got to either have two of them everywhere or you know, divide up the territory
[27:24.440 --> 27:28.440]  50 50. Yeah, it doesn't matter whether it's lightning and 30 pin or USB
[27:29.320 --> 27:34.360]  Micro USB and USB-C. It's the same problem, but somehow this only becomes like a public
[27:38.040 --> 27:45.720]  Brew haha without it. I don't get that. I don't I don't get it either. Uh, I guess I guess it's because
[27:48.280 --> 27:52.200]  I don't know. I mean, I guess you you could feasibly have a choice if you're on android
[27:52.200 --> 27:56.280]  You could have a choice to go to a phone that has like the connector that you like
[27:57.160 --> 28:00.280]  Which seems like an awful way to make a decision to buy how to buy a phone?
[28:01.720 --> 28:07.640]  I really like mini USB and i'm gonna buy whatever phone has a mini USB jack
[28:09.240 --> 28:12.040]  All right, let me take do not try to sell me micro USB
[28:13.800 --> 28:18.440]  Let me take a break here and uh tell you about a very special friend of the show
[28:18.440 --> 28:21.880]  Our first advertiser. It's wealthfront
[28:22.920 --> 28:28.360]  It's a low-cost automated investment service and it makes you easy to invest your money the right way
[28:29.400 --> 28:36.840]  You give wealthfront your money and they invest it for you. They sort of they have this algorithm that they use
[28:37.880 --> 28:40.440]  And you can adjust your risk adversity
[28:41.640 --> 28:45.960]  So you could be a little bit more aggressive knowing that it might be a little bit more likely that you'll lose money
[28:45.960 --> 28:50.920]  Or you can be a little bit more conservative. They have a quick little profile thing when you first sign up
[28:52.360 --> 28:58.460]  To sort of set that in place and then once you start going with it, they just automatically
[29:00.520 --> 29:02.520]  Buy and sell various
[29:02.840 --> 29:09.960]  Index funds to keep your total investment balanced. So when one sector of the stock market goes up
[29:09.960 --> 29:15.800]  And another sector goes down. They adjust it accordingly based on all sorts of complicated
[29:16.200 --> 29:22.040]  Academically proven things that I don't understand but more or less if you think about having a personal finance manager
[29:23.000 --> 29:28.440]  A person who you would just go to and give your money to and then trust them to invest it
[29:28.440 --> 29:32.840]  This is an automated service that replaces that now. What are the advantages to this?
[29:33.880 --> 29:39.000]  One of them is that with regular personal financial advisors you get charged with
[29:39.000 --> 29:40.520]  You get charged
[29:40.520 --> 29:42.520]  one percent on every transaction
[29:43.960 --> 29:49.480]  Some of them it's up to three percent and they they charge that on everything that you have under management
[29:49.480 --> 29:52.200]  So every dollar you put in they charge that fee
[29:53.080 --> 29:56.760]  Wealthfront only charges zero point two five percent
[29:57.560 --> 29:59.400]  Of what you have invested?
[29:59.400 --> 30:01.720]  And they only start charging that
[30:02.280 --> 30:03.320]  over
[30:03.320 --> 30:10.760]  Uh ten thousand dollars invested so under ten thousand dollars invested. They don't charge anything, but they even have a special deal
[30:11.080 --> 30:13.960]  For listeners of the show use the code. I'm going to give you at the end here
[30:15.080 --> 30:17.240]  And it goes up to fifteen thousand dollars
[30:18.600 --> 30:21.400]  So your first fifteen thousand dollars that you put in with these guys
[30:22.280 --> 30:24.200]  uh is all
[30:24.200 --> 30:28.120]  No fee and then they only start charging that zero point two five percent
[30:28.760 --> 30:30.840]  fee on what you have over
[30:30.840 --> 30:38.040]  Fifteen thousand dollars, uh, it's a five hundred dollar minimum investment. So what they've told me is that
[30:38.920 --> 30:43.560]  A lot of people start out like that. They'll just put five hundred dollars in just to see how it works
[30:43.560 --> 30:47.080]  And then they only put quote-unquote real money in after they see it
[30:48.200 --> 30:51.960]  And they're perfectly welcome to do that. And if you use the code, you can start like that right away
[30:52.280 --> 30:56.120]  They've got all sorts of other things just go there and read it and they'll tell you about it but sophisticated
[30:56.120 --> 31:01.080]  investment strategies like tasks, tax loss harvesting
[31:01.640 --> 31:06.440]  Which is a way to just optimize automatically not just once a year, but like as you go
[31:07.000 --> 31:13.880]  How to maximize your profits your returns the size of your investment while minimizing your tax bill
[31:14.520 --> 31:16.520]  Uh all sorts of great stuff like that
[31:18.520 --> 31:22.600]  Go there and check them out. I actually have to tell you I I said that last time they sponsored the show
[31:22.600 --> 31:24.600]  I said I was going to check them out. I'm actually very interested
[31:24.600 --> 31:27.400]  it turns out I can't I can't actually
[31:28.760 --> 31:30.840]  I can't use them as a customer because
[31:31.960 --> 31:36.360]  Scc rules would prevent me then from saying good things about them while they're paying me
[31:37.080 --> 31:39.880]  It's all very complicated, but we're doing this on the up and up and I really
[31:40.520 --> 31:42.040]  really really
[31:42.040 --> 31:44.040]  Uh want to stay out of prison, so
[31:45.160 --> 31:50.840]  I'm not going to do it. I i'm just telling you flat out. No, I am not a customer of wealthfront
[31:50.840 --> 31:57.160]  Uh, because if I were then i'd be in i'd be in legal trouble, but it really does look very interesting to me
[31:57.160 --> 31:59.240]  It looks like something that I would want to check out
[31:59.800 --> 32:03.720]  I have to read this too. I have to read this verbatim for compliance purposes

[32:54.660 --> 32:57.540]  I get nervous. I get nervous with the sponsor where I feel like am I getting legal?
[32:58.420 --> 33:00.420]  You know what? I mean like a
[33:01.460 --> 33:06.500]  In the clink. Yeah, if I tell you something's not true about casper mattresses, you know what I mean? Like it's
[33:06.500 --> 33:13.560]  Uh, I mean, there's always the stories about cutting those tags off the mattresses, but that's not even true. It's only for like retailers
[33:14.660 --> 33:20.900]  And and uh, it seems that you know, like, you know, sometimes as podcast hosts we get free stuff from the yes
[33:21.380 --> 33:24.820]  Yeah, and it seems like wealthfront would be a great person place to get free stuff
[33:26.420 --> 33:32.020]  And they can't give me an alas. Alas. They cannot give you any free stuff. That's a real drag. Yeah
[33:32.020 --> 33:37.140]  Yeah, really is sort of an interesting thing where it's the idea would be that they don't want to you know
[33:37.140 --> 33:39.380]  The rules are in place for good reason because they don't want to
[33:39.780 --> 33:42.740]  They can't have a thing where they're like paying somebody to go on a show and say
[33:43.300 --> 33:48.740]  You know that uh, I put all my money in wealthfront and it went up and that means it's always going to go up, you know
[33:49.460 --> 33:51.220]  Right. They they can't have that
[33:52.740 --> 33:56.340]  Let's go back to the if we go back to the audio port thing. I wanted to say this
[33:56.340 --> 34:02.180]  That's the idea of let's just say in theory that apple could either like wait
[34:02.260 --> 34:06.580]  Let's just say for like a month after the new iphone 7 comes out and it doesn't have the headphone jack
[34:07.060 --> 34:09.060]  If they just have like a fishbowl
[34:10.340 --> 34:15.460]  In the apple store where you can go in and you and and uh and just say hey
[34:15.460 --> 34:20.260]  I need I need one another one of those adapters and apple, you know, they just give you one, you know
[34:20.420 --> 34:22.580]  Not not only would you get one for free with your iphone
[34:22.580 --> 34:26.100]  That you could just go to the apple store and if you want like two or three of them
[34:26.100 --> 34:30.020]  They'll just give you like, you know a reasonable number of them and then after that
[34:30.580 --> 34:35.380]  Like like after you know, the holiday season's over or something like that
[34:35.380 --> 34:40.340]  They just settle in and sell them for let's say I mean, I think the cheapest they could possibly sell them for is
[34:40.340 --> 34:42.340]  Let's say 9.95
[34:42.340 --> 34:45.460]  It doesn't seem to me like they would sell them for less but that's pretty cheap
[34:46.660 --> 34:49.380]  Why don't they do that? Why don't they just give them away like candy?
[34:49.380 --> 34:51.620]  You got me I I think
[34:52.420 --> 34:54.820]  Well, there's two there's two explanations one
[34:55.460 --> 35:01.700]  Is the cynical one which is that they really do purposefully sell them for an exorbitant price because they want the money
[35:04.340 --> 35:10.100]  And and the two my two explanations aren't necessarily at odds with each other there could be different groups within the company that agree
[35:10.100 --> 35:13.780]  Agree with both of them, right? So there could be like a tim cook
[35:13.780 --> 35:19.780]  Bean counter side a jeff williams operation side that says if we can sell these for 29 dollars
[35:19.780 --> 35:22.420]  That would be great because we can make them for three dollars
[35:23.860 --> 35:28.500]  The other side the product marketing side might be sort of a
[35:30.420 --> 35:34.260]  If we don't make it painful sufficiently painful
[35:35.380 --> 35:37.380]  To make this transition
[35:37.380 --> 35:41.220]  Even knowing that the that there's a cost to our image
[35:41.220 --> 35:48.500]  Because people will see us as money-grubbing and purposefully making annoying port decisions on the iphone every year
[35:49.380 --> 35:55.220]  But if we don't do this if it's not sufficiently painful, it won't motivate people to move to the new thing. Yeah
[35:56.100 --> 35:58.100]  Because and think about it with
[35:58.820 --> 36:00.980]  Just the fact that there already are lightning
[36:02.020 --> 36:05.380]  Headphones out there, but it's as far as I can tell very few people use them
[36:05.380 --> 36:10.420]  And and there aren't as many as I guess apple would like i'm assuming they're more expensive
[36:11.700 --> 36:18.180]  They haven't liked yeah, and I guess they have to be licensed. I don't know. Yeah, they would have to be right. Um,
[36:20.100 --> 36:22.100]  I
[36:22.420 --> 36:24.420]  I
[36:25.460 --> 36:27.380]  Well the thing I mean the only thing that's a
[36:28.420 --> 36:33.380]  I think that's certainly probably true in the switch from 30 pin to lightning
[36:33.380 --> 36:37.540]  Um, because I think lightning was just it's just really a legitimately a better
[36:38.660 --> 36:39.940]  experience
[36:39.940 --> 36:42.820]  uh, the the only thing that is kind of a
[36:43.540 --> 36:47.860]  I mean, obviously some of this is because we don't really know the whole story yet or even if it's happening
[36:48.100 --> 36:51.780]  But like it laid the but the charging situation is not really a better
[36:52.660 --> 36:55.540]  Situation right that is not a better experience
[36:55.540 --> 37:04.820]  That is not a better experience hmm Yeah, so I guess the other question to ask is what would make this configuration better
[37:05.220 --> 37:11.060]  Because I really do think apple would only this is only going to happen if apple thinks that overall this is better in some way
[37:11.380 --> 37:16.580]  yeah, and I don't I'm not quite sure I see it especially with the charging and
[37:17.540 --> 37:19.540]  listening at the same time angle
[37:20.820 --> 37:24.340]  We may or may not have just spent the first hour of the show talking about
[37:24.340 --> 37:27.780]  about something that's not happening that I don't even think is going to happen, but
[37:28.660 --> 37:33.540]  I just think that it could because it just sounds like something apple would do which is more or less what I said when I
[37:33.540 --> 37:38.900]  Blogged about it that I just I just thought it just sounds like so happily like we're gonna get rid of this thing
[37:39.300 --> 37:44.820]  That it seems absurd to get rid of and yeah knowing that it's gonna make some people very angry
[37:45.140 --> 37:47.460]  And make everybody else at least mildly annoyed
[37:48.500 --> 37:50.020]  Yeah
[37:50.020 --> 37:52.900]  Well, they've been doing it for you know, they've been doing it since the iMac, right?
[37:52.900 --> 37:57.700]  Yeah, the other the other whole angle on this and i've seen tons of people on twitter
[37:57.700 --> 38:01.700]  We absolutely have to mention it can't go on without doing it would be that
[38:02.420 --> 38:07.560]  The the idea that maybe apple expects people to switch to wireless headphones
[38:08.100 --> 38:13.220]  And that maybe even the default ones that will ship with the iphone will be wireless and that yes the
[38:14.660 --> 38:17.480]  You know if you want to use your old headphones
[38:17.860 --> 38:21.140]  You can do it with the dongle if you want to get a new pair of lightning headphones
[38:21.140 --> 38:28.280]  You can do it without a dongle but that the default experience will switch from you know, connected headphones to wireless headphones
[38:30.180 --> 38:36.360]  And and they would they would have to they would have to ship bluetooth headphones with every with every iphone iphone
[38:37.460 --> 38:43.780]  Possible. I mean it certainly would be more expensive my experience with wireless headphones though
[38:43.780 --> 38:50.580]  Is yeah is not perfect. I I do like it for some things. I I do like it when I go jogging
[38:51.300 --> 38:54.020]  uh really is there's no configuration of
[38:54.580 --> 39:01.140]  You know, even with even not even counting connecting it to an iphone, but just connecting it to like the the smallest, you know
[39:01.140 --> 39:06.100]  I I've ipod nanos that they ever made or whatever the small one is
[39:06.660 --> 39:08.180]  um
[39:08.180 --> 39:09.840]  no way there's
[39:09.840 --> 39:11.540]  exercising with a
[39:11.540 --> 39:17.780]  A wire connected to your ears is it eventually you're going to you're going to get tangled up in it. Um,
[39:18.660 --> 39:23.540]  So for that it's great, but there's some problems with it where it's the latency isn't great
[39:24.020 --> 39:28.980]  It certainly isn't the instantaneous latency of a wired connection, you know
[39:28.980 --> 39:32.820]  Like when you hit hit the clicker on your ear thing to pause
[39:33.380 --> 39:38.180]  It takes a moment it there's and it's noticeable that it doesn't pause the audio immediately
[39:38.180 --> 39:44.420]  Yeah, it's a fraction of a second for me now after i've updated the firmware on on these beats ones that I have
[39:44.820 --> 39:49.300]  But it's definitely noticeable every time I notice it every single time because i'm used to I have you know
[39:49.300 --> 39:56.020]  I don't know a lifetime of thinking that as soon as I hit pause my audio pauses. I mean that was true even in the cassette era
[39:56.740 --> 39:57.700]  Yeah
[39:57.700 --> 40:03.540]  Did the beats um skip ever or sort of like stutter every once in a while? Yeah
[40:03.540 --> 40:08.580]  Because that's i've got these plantronics ones that I that I like well enough. They're fairly comfortable
[40:09.140 --> 40:11.140]  And they stay on real well
[40:11.140 --> 40:16.180]  But yeah, I mean they I tried several really cheap bluetooth headsets and they were
[40:16.740 --> 40:19.300]  Well, I was really trying to find something that would work with the watch
[40:19.780 --> 40:21.140]  Because I wanted to be able to run, you know
[40:21.140 --> 40:24.580]  just like leave the house with just the wearing just the watch and my
[40:25.140 --> 40:28.100]  And my bluetooth headphones and the cheap ones just did not
[40:28.660 --> 40:32.740]  You know, this there was too much way too much skipping. I couldn't it wasn't a good choice
[40:32.740 --> 40:34.500]  It wasn't a good experience at all
[40:34.500 --> 40:38.660]  So I got these plantronics ones which are much better, but still every once in a while you get a little skip
[40:39.380 --> 40:42.180]  Mostly much more with the watch than with the phone
[40:42.260 --> 40:48.580]  But even so I think i've gotten a couple with you know, a couple instances with the phone too. Yeah wanting to go and
[40:49.380 --> 40:55.460]  You know if I could just put if I could have a copy of overcast on my watch and have the actual tele
[40:56.160 --> 41:01.860]  Overcast or even I would even maybe even go back to apple's podcast player if it wasn't possible for third-party apps
[41:01.860 --> 41:04.020]  but if I could have the podcasts on my watch
[41:04.820 --> 41:07.380]  and leave the house with nothing but the watch and
[41:08.020 --> 41:10.020]  Bluetooth headphones, that would be fantastic
[41:10.820 --> 41:17.380]  Because yeah any any possible way of carrying the phone stinks for if you're going out running or something like that. Yeah. Yeah
[41:17.540 --> 41:19.540]  Um, but it's hard now
[41:20.500 --> 41:24.100]  It's not and and it's it's just it's kind of frustrating because that's one of the things that
[41:24.500 --> 41:27.620]  That was one of the first videos. Yeah, like in the first watch
[41:28.660 --> 41:29.860]  demo
[41:29.860 --> 41:34.260]  Uh, you know, they show these people jogging with headphones. Yeah, it's like
[41:35.140 --> 41:39.140]  That's not really. Yeah, and really that didn't really pan out so well. No, and when you
[41:40.020 --> 41:46.260]  Once you get to wireless the pairing process no matter how much effort they put into it is nowhere near as seamless as the pairing
[41:46.340 --> 41:52.020]  Process of a wired pair of headphones, right? Oh, yeah, pull it out of this one stick it into this one and you're paired
[41:52.420 --> 41:58.500]  Whereas if your wireless headphones are normally paired with your iphone, but you want to just leave and pair, you know
[41:58.500 --> 42:00.660]  Have it with your watch. You've got to go
[42:01.540 --> 42:04.420]  I I forget what you even do. I think you have to do it on the phone, right?
[42:04.500 --> 42:09.780]  You go over to the phone and launch the apple watch app and pair it from there and it's then it's unpaired from here
[42:11.460 --> 42:14.420]  It's I don't I don't know it just seems to me like to make it
[42:14.900 --> 42:20.500]  To make that work and make it be the default experience that we use for headphones seems like it's not there
[42:21.140 --> 42:26.260]  And the bluetooth latency thing and then the skipping and stuff like that is definitely an issue. Amy has a pair that she bought
[42:26.260 --> 42:32.520]  Um, I forget what brand they were, but she just went to the wire cutter and bought there. Here's our recommended
[42:33.620 --> 42:38.100]  pair of bluetooth headphones and she got she just got those and
[42:40.820 --> 42:41.780]  She
[42:41.780 --> 42:47.300]  She was mad. She wanted for marco to do a wireless headphone thing because she was very upset because they were not good
[42:47.620 --> 42:54.980]  I think what happened is I think that the wire cutter might be values the cost a little bit more than quality than than
[42:54.980 --> 42:56.420]  We do
[42:56.420 --> 43:02.260]  Because hers skip a lot weren't they still weren't those still a couple hundred bucks because I looked at those two. Yeah, they weren't cheap
[43:02.260 --> 43:06.820]  That's the other thing. Yeah, it wasn't like it wasn't like it was here's what we recommend because it was super low cost
[43:06.820 --> 43:11.220]  it was sort of a balance between cost and okay, um
[43:11.940 --> 43:16.020]  And I my the beats ones I bought were I don't know they were like three or four thousand dollars
[43:16.980 --> 43:18.980]  Oh my god
[43:18.980 --> 43:24.980]  God you're kidding i'm kidding
[43:26.500 --> 43:29.700]  Okay for a minute there I think there I thought that was possible
[43:30.100 --> 43:35.060]  I do think that they were 200 bucks probably I think they're like 299 or 249 or something
[43:35.780 --> 43:40.900]  It felt like I this is why I looked at that. Yeah, it felt like I as I was cashing out
[43:40.980 --> 43:42.980]  I bought them in an apple store
[43:42.980 --> 43:45.620]  just to look at them and I thought i'll buy these beats ones because the
[43:45.620 --> 43:49.780]  These have come out recently that you know, they've come out. I think they came out this year
[43:49.860 --> 43:54.340]  So it was like after the apple acquisition. It's not a very appley product. It's not like apple has
[43:55.060 --> 44:00.660]  You know, these are probably designed beforehand. I mean and they use micro usb, which is real gross but um
[44:01.380 --> 44:03.220]  for the charging, um
[44:03.220 --> 44:06.900]  But I figured if the beats ones don't work right with apple and I you know
[44:06.900 --> 44:13.140]  I say this knowing beats his reputation that the audio quality for beats headphones of any sort is not that great and that you're
[44:13.140 --> 44:15.460]  You know overpaying for the brand. Um
[44:17.540 --> 44:20.180]  But I just figured if the beats ones don't work, right, uh
[44:21.060 --> 44:27.300]  Which ones will so I might as well just pay for it but paying 249 for a pair of these things really felt like yes
[44:28.100 --> 44:30.100]  Paying like four thousand dollars
[44:32.660 --> 44:35.140]  Um, well the plantronics ones were like 90 bucks
[44:36.420 --> 44:38.820]  Um, and they're they're they're okay, right?
[44:38.820 --> 44:44.980]  All right, but if even the cheap ones from third parties cost 99 can apple really afford to
[44:46.260 --> 44:50.020]  Well when I say I bought some cheap ones, I mean the I the other ones that I bought were like 30 bucks
[44:50.500 --> 44:52.660]  Hmm, they were really cheap. Wow
[44:53.460 --> 44:55.460]  And I don't recommend that
[44:57.620 --> 45:00.180]  So I had to go so I basically I tried these other ones and I was like, okay
[45:00.180 --> 45:05.540]  This is a terrible experience and I got then I got the plantronics when I was so I went up. I tripled my my outlay
[45:05.540 --> 45:07.540]  And
[45:08.260 --> 45:12.180]  Was satisfied enough, I mean, I you know, so I got the watch and I wanted to be able to do this
[45:12.340 --> 45:14.340]  you know running with the headphones and
[45:14.740 --> 45:20.180]  Um, I at the time like back in the spring. I wasn't sure how much I was going to like the watch
[45:21.140 --> 45:23.140]  and so I didn't
[45:23.220 --> 45:26.100]  I didn't really want to dump a lot of money on this whole thing
[45:26.820 --> 45:28.500]  um, so
[45:28.500 --> 45:32.260]  I wanted to I wanted for particularly for the headphones. I wanted to pay as little as possible. Yeah
[45:32.260 --> 45:34.260]  Um
[45:35.380 --> 45:39.140]  So, I don't know it seems to me that apple would have to improve the state of the art
[45:39.920 --> 45:44.120]  Considerably to make that possible as the sort of default experience
[45:44.580 --> 45:48.580]  For how we're going to listen to stuff from our iphones to make wireless
[45:48.900 --> 45:54.580]  And I say wireless rather than even bluetooth because maybe the way that they would do it would be to use their own wireless
[45:55.840 --> 45:59.460]  Airplay. Yeah, I don't know. I hope it's not airplane
[45:59.460 --> 46:07.620]  Right. Well, so I but use something other than bluetooth simply because I don't I honestly don't think bluetooth is all that good
[46:07.780 --> 46:14.900]  Like I quipped last month that you know the slogan of the bluetooth, you know consortium is just wait till next year
[46:15.060 --> 46:17.940]  But it really is like it's been forever ever since
[46:19.220 --> 46:22.100]  Every I ever since I first bought my first bluetooth product
[46:22.580 --> 46:24.660]  It has always been you figure it out
[46:24.660 --> 46:30.740]  You finally get it working and you realize this isn't that great and it's kind of finicky and sometimes it loses
[46:31.300 --> 46:32.740]  It loses its connection
[46:32.740 --> 46:35.540]  even when it's right next door to the thing it's supposed to be connected to
[46:35.860 --> 46:39.380]  And then you go and read about it and they're like you just wait till bluetooth 2.0
[46:39.460 --> 46:43.780]  It solves all these problems and then bluetooth 2.0 comes out and you realize that it has all these problems
[46:43.860 --> 46:47.700]  And and they say just wait till bluetooth 3.0. Just wait till bluetooth
[46:48.320 --> 46:50.420]  4.0 with low power and stuff like that
[46:50.420 --> 46:55.220]  Um, but it's you know, now they're saying, you know, whatever the next bluetooth is is going to solve all these problems
[46:55.220 --> 46:59.300]  I mean, I hope it does someday but I wouldn't be surprised. I really wouldn't be surprised at all if apple
[47:00.020 --> 47:04.420]  Just goes proprietary on it and figures out their own short range wireless
[47:05.620 --> 47:07.620]  networking thing
[47:07.860 --> 47:09.060]  That'd be nice
[47:09.060 --> 47:12.900]  I don't even know if networking is quite the right way to put it but you know wireless connector technology
[47:13.620 --> 47:17.940]  Just do it on your own. I don't know my my experience though with airplay has not been
[47:17.940 --> 47:19.940]  It's not been great. So
[47:20.980 --> 47:24.020]  I think that that's more complicated though because I think airplay is
[47:25.380 --> 47:30.580]  Who knows? Yeah, it's dependent on a lot of different things right because it has to go through your network and right and it goes
[47:30.580 --> 47:35.620]  It's not just bluetooth or something. It's you know, it goes over the wi-fi channel and stuff like that, right?
[47:35.860 --> 47:38.660]  The other thing but it gets back to charging and it gets back
[47:39.220 --> 47:44.020]  To you know that there's if you're using wired headphones and sharing the same port
[47:44.020 --> 47:48.180]  There's a problem or if you want to charge it. There's a charging problem with wireless headphones, too
[47:48.180 --> 47:53.060]  Which is that your headphones can can lose their battery power and that's a real pain in the ass
[47:53.940 --> 47:57.860]  And so if your default headphones are wireless now
[47:57.860 --> 48:04.500]  You're just adding yet another thing that you need to charge to your life like I understand the appeal of wow
[48:04.500 --> 48:08.100]  This is yet another thing that we don't I need I don't need a cable for anymore
[48:08.100 --> 48:12.900]  To use but on the other hand you need now you need another thing that you have to charge all the time
[48:14.180 --> 48:16.980]  And the beats the beats, you know have decent battery life
[48:16.980 --> 48:20.820]  It's about what I kind of I guess about the best I could have hoped for
[48:21.540 --> 48:25.220]  But it's not great. I mean it's you have to you definitely have to remember if you use them all the time
[48:25.220 --> 48:27.220]  You have to remember to charge them a lot
[48:28.020 --> 48:31.540]  the plan for the nice thing about the plantronics is when you turn it on and
[48:32.260 --> 48:33.220]  Actually, I don't think it doesn't work
[48:33.220 --> 48:34.340]  It should do it when you turn it off
[48:34.340 --> 48:39.940]  But when you turn it on it tells you how charged it is hmm. It says battery full or battery
[48:40.500 --> 48:45.700]  Well, you can see partially full. It's like the smallest icon anybody's ever created
[48:45.700 --> 48:50.180]  But when you pair them with your iPhone, there's a little charge indicator up in the menu bar
[48:52.660 --> 48:56.500]  For everything or just for the beats oh, maybe it's just for the beat I thought it was yeah
[48:57.220 --> 49:01.380]  I don't remember seeing that but I don't and wasn't looking for it. It's a tiny instead of a battery
[49:01.380 --> 49:04.580]  That's horizontal. It's a little vertical battery and okay
[49:04.580 --> 49:08.900]  It is so small that I really I can't see it if I have my contact lenses in okay
[49:08.900 --> 49:13.700]  All right, I can see it, but I can't read I can't read how high it goes because it's just
[49:14.820 --> 49:20.340]  I could just tell that it's like there's like a little rectangle there, but I sure it's not your detached retina
[49:20.900 --> 49:24.500]  No, it's not it's it really it's even if I close my bad eye
[49:24.500 --> 49:29.460]  I can't I just can't make it out if I have my contacts in if I have my glasses on I can tell you
[49:29.460 --> 49:33.380]  My glasses off and then I can see that close, but it's just way too small
[49:35.860 --> 49:37.860]  What's the indicator on your plantronics
[49:37.860 --> 49:42.900]  How does it get to suggest how much batteries left when you turn it when you power it on when you put them on?
[49:43.300 --> 49:48.260]  And power them on it tells you it talks. Oh like with a voice. Yeah
[49:48.900 --> 49:50.900]  Well, what how did what does it say?
[49:51.940 --> 49:57.460]  Battery full or lay that's I think just it says connected or headphones
[49:57.460 --> 49:59.460]  connected and then
[50:00.900 --> 50:05.220]  The beat very full this says think it's just something else but I can't remember what it is the beats just play a tone
[50:05.220 --> 50:09.780]  But the tone definitely doesn't change when when you uh, you know, give in the battery life
[50:11.300 --> 50:13.300]  Well, anyway
[50:14.980 --> 50:18.580]  Coincidence of all coincidences our next sponsor is casper
[50:19.380 --> 50:23.220]  They're the company that makes engineered mattresses at a shockingly fair price
[50:23.220 --> 50:28.180]  Uh, and I believe their mattresses come complete with all the legally obligated mattress tags
[50:30.180 --> 50:33.620]  Which you are free to cut off once you set off set them up at home
[50:35.220 --> 50:41.860]  They have here's what they do they're like the apple of mattress companies like they don't you don't go to them and then decide whether you
[50:41.860 --> 50:44.900]  want this type of foam or that type of foam or medium sink or
[50:45.700 --> 50:48.340]  This sink or spring technology or that technology?
[50:48.340 --> 50:54.500]  These guys have figured out exactly the way a good mattress should feel and they've engineered their own
[50:55.220 --> 50:56.820]  custom
[50:56.820 --> 51:00.660]  blend of latex foam and memory foam together to have
[51:01.540 --> 51:06.500]  A mattress that is just right these guys know mattresses. I don't you don't know mattresses
[51:06.500 --> 51:11.540]  I don't know mattresses you buy a mattress every couple years at most frequent these guys think about it all the time
[51:11.540 --> 51:13.540]  They're mattress pros. They've got just the right one
[51:13.540 --> 51:19.540]  So all you have to pick is your size. You don't have to go there and figure out whether you want springs or memory foam or
[51:19.540 --> 51:25.860]  Latex foam you just get a great mattress. You just pick what size bed you have you get a great mattress and there you go
[51:26.180 --> 51:30.660]  Now the other thing is you're going to pay a lot less you're getting a high quality mattress
[51:31.380 --> 51:34.580]  That is made in america american-made mattresses
[51:36.420 --> 51:38.420]  And the prices are just fantastic
[51:38.420 --> 51:44.100]  Five hundred dollars for a twin size mattress nine hundred fifty dollars for a king size mattress compare that to industry prices
[51:44.100 --> 51:51.300]  And it's just outstanding and the whole reason is that they sell direct. There are no middlemen. They're not selling to there's no, you know
[51:51.300 --> 51:53.300]  middleman
[51:53.300 --> 51:58.900]  Retailers that you go through and that they need to mark up and there's no salesman getting a commission
[51:59.780 --> 52:04.660]  nothing like that and you even save on the delivery cost because they they because they're not
[52:04.660 --> 52:10.260]  And you even save on the delivery cost because they they because they're made out of this foam and they vacuum seal them up into these
[52:10.260 --> 52:14.500]  Ridiculously little like dorm room refrigerator box size things
[52:15.700 --> 52:17.700]  It even costs less for them to ship them around
[52:18.900 --> 52:20.260]  so
[52:20.260 --> 52:25.060]  If you have any question in your mind if you need a mattress and you're thinking i'd really this casper thing sounds great
[52:25.060 --> 52:29.700]  You don't have to go to a store. You get a nice little delivery. You're just not sure
[52:29.700 --> 52:35.780]  About you know buying this thing online without ever having to to try it out in the store touch it or lay on it or whatever
[52:37.300 --> 52:43.700]  They they have a money-back guarantee for a hundred days sleep on the thing for three months and if you're not happy
[52:44.340 --> 52:47.060]  Just call them up and they will
[52:47.860 --> 52:51.460]  They'll just come, you know, take it. No, no questions asked. There's no hard sale
[52:51.460 --> 52:57.780]  They really do if you don't like it just call them up. They'll take it back hundred days and that's with free delivery and the return is
[52:57.780 --> 53:03.060]  Painless, uh, so here's what you do go to casper sleep dot com slash
[53:03.860 --> 53:05.300]  the talk show
[53:05.300 --> 53:11.300]  I think slash talk show works too because I think at some point I might have screwed it up during the sponsor reading a
[53:11.940 --> 53:14.820]  Very very nice enough to fix it and make both work
[53:15.060 --> 53:19.780]  But uh, I just checked casper sleep.com slash the talk show does work
[53:20.260 --> 53:25.460]  And when you go there you can save 50 bucks off any mattress off the already low price
[53:25.460 --> 53:31.700]  Just by going there, uh terms and conditions apply. I don't know what the terms and conditions are, but but they do apply
[53:31.700 --> 53:33.700]  So my thanks to casper
[53:34.100 --> 53:37.460]  And just for disclosure purposes you're lying on a casper mattress right now
[53:38.100 --> 53:44.580]  I am I that is how I record the show that for acoustic reasons. It's actually very nice acoustics to have
[53:45.140 --> 53:49.220]  Yeah, I think so. Yeah, and I sound better when i'm laying flat on my back
[53:49.220 --> 53:53.700]  Well, you know helps the diaphragm, yeah, uh
[53:55.940 --> 54:00.740]  What's the other we got there's another rumor that came out today and it doesn't make any sense
[54:02.420 --> 54:05.460]  It doesn't make any sense at all to me so I didn't even know how to write about it
[54:05.460 --> 54:08.820]  I thought you know what this is pat if it doesn't make any sense. It's better for the podcast
[54:10.340 --> 54:14.900]  I say it but I really mean that I actually mean that I find that having a podcast
[54:14.900 --> 54:21.220]  In addition to a blog some the best stuff to put on the to talk about on the podcast is the stuff that doesn't make any
[54:21.220 --> 54:23.220]  sense to me
[54:23.220 --> 54:28.500]  And this is a story mac rumors picked it up. This is about the uh, do you see this with the
[54:29.220 --> 54:34.900]  Somebody I don't know who the source is here, but somebody is saying that apple is working on uh,
[54:35.700 --> 54:39.700]  Next generation. I or not ipad macbook airs
[54:39.700 --> 54:43.700]  13 inch and 15 inch that'll be coming out. Uh,
[54:44.740 --> 54:46.740]  13 inch and 15 inch
[54:47.300 --> 54:50.980]  This it i'll send you the link right now, but i'll read it to you
[54:52.020 --> 54:56.980]  This is taiwan. This is information from taiwan's economic daily news
[54:59.460 --> 55:01.460]  And what they say
[55:03.620 --> 55:05.620]  Is that
[55:05.620 --> 55:12.580]  Apple may be preparing to introduce a revamped macbook air at next year's worldwide developers conference according to taiwan's economic daily news
[55:13.140 --> 55:18.260]  And they have a little google translate link to the original if apple holds true to recent history. It would be that would be in june
[55:19.860 --> 55:21.860]  Blah blah blah
[55:24.500 --> 55:30.820]  Unclear whether an 11-inch model will also be included. I went to the google translate link and it's a little bit different
[55:30.820 --> 55:37.700]  Clear whether an 11-inch model will also be included. I went to the google translate thing and it did seem like that's what the original
[55:38.260 --> 55:42.900]  Article which was written in chinese, you know said that it definitely mentioned the 11-inch and you know
[55:43.780 --> 55:46.180]  trying to read between the lines of the
[55:47.700 --> 55:52.260]  You know the google translate english it seemed like they were saying that it might happen or might not
[55:52.900 --> 55:59.380]  Um, but they're saying 13 inch and 15 inch sizes. No, no other stuff about the specs or anything like that
[55:59.380 --> 56:01.380]  No news about whether they're retina or not
[56:02.020 --> 56:03.940]  um
[56:03.940 --> 56:05.940]  This whole thing makes no sense to me. What's no
[56:06.580 --> 56:08.580]  No, it makes no sense to me either
[56:09.380 --> 56:10.980]  because to me
[56:10.980 --> 56:14.980]  Starting even just with the naming of the eye of the macbook
[56:15.540 --> 56:20.360]  You know the one that only has one usb c port that's for charging and connecting peripherals
[56:22.500 --> 56:26.020]  Which by the way might be a hint as to how much apple cares about you having to
[56:26.020 --> 56:30.500]  Use some kind of y splitting dongle if you need to charge and listen to something at the same time
[56:32.500 --> 56:37.540]  But anyway the name of it the fact that it is thinner and lighter than a macbook air
[56:37.620 --> 56:39.620]  But they just called it the macbook
[56:39.620 --> 56:42.340]  certainly suggests to me that the macbook air is
[56:42.820 --> 56:50.100]  You know only hanging around because it can be sold cheaper than the macbook and as the price of making a macbook drops
[56:50.180 --> 56:55.300]  Eventually, the macbook airs are going to go away. It doesn't make any sense to me that they would do a next generation one
[56:55.300 --> 56:56.260]  Yeah
[56:56.260 --> 56:57.860]  Yeah
[56:57.860 --> 57:00.580]  It's very strange. Uh and and different sizes
[57:01.540 --> 57:03.620]  Yeah, the only thing that that would make sense to me
[57:04.260 --> 57:06.260]  would be if uh
[57:06.500 --> 57:11.140]  Here's the only way that this story makes sense to me is if they're not talking about macbook errors
[57:11.140 --> 57:15.460]  But instead the devices they're talking about are in fact next generation macbook pros
[57:16.420 --> 57:19.300]  Because then 13 and 15 inch are the two sizes
[57:20.100 --> 57:21.620]  um
[57:21.620 --> 57:29.060]  And you know compared to the macbook the current macbook pros are rather thick
[57:30.180 --> 57:33.000]  You know, and it seems like apple sort of prefers
[57:33.680 --> 57:40.900]  Aesthetically the teardrop profile for laptops and that the macbook pros the retina macbook pros in both sizes
[57:41.620 --> 57:45.060]  Have the symmetric rectangular sort of profile
[57:45.540 --> 57:50.100]  Simply because that's the best that they could do at the time to get all the components in to drive the retina screen
[57:50.100 --> 57:52.500]  So my guess would be if there's any truth to this story
[57:52.740 --> 57:58.660]  It would be this would be my guess is that new macbook pros are coming next year and they might go back to
[57:58.740 --> 58:00.740]  They might go to like an air style
[58:01.220 --> 58:03.220]  teardrop profile
[58:04.660 --> 58:09.540]  Yeah, yeah, because if you go through that and replace air with pro it makes a lot more sense
[58:09.700 --> 58:15.060]  Yeah, and I just think marketing wise I feel like the current situation where they've got three
[58:15.060 --> 58:19.460]  Three types of macbook
[58:20.740 --> 58:27.220]  Even if you just count the pros and the errors as the same but which size do you want which I think is fair
[58:27.220 --> 58:29.700]  I don't think people are confused by whether they want a
[58:30.100 --> 58:34.180]  11 inch or 13 inch air or a 13 inch or 15 inch or
[58:34.740 --> 58:36.740]  13 inch pro or 15 inch pro
[58:36.740 --> 58:46.020]  Um, I I still think though that having to choose that that the the macbook existing alongside the air is just a little bit confusing
[58:46.020 --> 58:49.940]  And I know that there's a well do you want a retina screen or you know?
[58:49.940 --> 58:52.900]  Do you want to have the super thin even more portable size?
[58:53.300 --> 58:58.180]  But it just seems to me like it's all about what price points they can hit and right now they can't hit that
[58:58.500 --> 59:04.900]  899 starting price with this macbook and so the air lives on until it you know, yeah
[59:04.900 --> 59:07.540]  until it you know, yeah until it can
[59:10.580 --> 59:16.100]  Is the is the retina screen itself that I mean is that the price different I mean is that component
[59:18.100 --> 59:21.220]  That expensive I guess I think so combined with the
[59:21.860 --> 59:24.100]  Having a graphics card that can drive it
[59:24.180 --> 59:28.260]  Yeah, because it has to go, you know has to really has to you know from a graphics card perspective
[59:28.260 --> 59:32.100]  It really is more of a 4x difference in performance than a 2x
[59:32.100 --> 59:37.780]  It's really the total number of pixels not just how many pixels are in an inch in one dimension. Yeah
[59:38.580 --> 59:40.020]  um
[59:40.020 --> 59:44.740]  I really do think it's you know, definitely definitely expensive. It doesn't seem like they would
[59:45.680 --> 59:48.580]  Just continue the pro and rename it the air
[59:49.780 --> 59:55.700]  No, that doesn't make any sense. That's another I mean, that's another logical possibility going through this but it doesn't that seems unlikely to me
[59:56.020 --> 59:58.020]  Yeah, because it's it
[59:58.020 --> 01:00:00.980]  You know, you can quibble about some of apple's product naming
[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:02.980]  strategies
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:03.880]  um
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:06.120]  and whether they make sense or not like the way that the
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:12.120]  Third generation ipad just became the ipad not the ipad 3
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:18.280]  Right, wasn't that when they did that? Yeah, there was like the ipad ipad 2 and then ipad
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.480]  I think right now we have ipad
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:25.480]  Mini 2 and ipad mini 4, right?
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:31.320]  Right. Yeah, something like that. There's no there's no ipad. There's no ipad mini 3 on sale, right?
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:33.320]  um
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.680]  so like when they decide to just number stuff versus
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:40.920]  You know like and and you know, there's it the whole thing is a little
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:46.200]  I don't know messy right ipads just get a number that increments
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:52.360]  Even if the form factor stays the same but the iphone, you know gets this s every other year
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.760]  but nothing makes like
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.880]  Nothing goes contrary to common sense
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:01.640]  Which is what it would be if if the ipad
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:05.480]  Or if the macbook pro got renamed the macbook air
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:10.200]  It's just that doesn't make any sense because it would be heavier than the regular macbook
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.320]  right, um
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:17.320]  Pro to me says this is more powerful and therefore it's a little heavier
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:21.000]  Yeah, whereas air says this is lighter
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.760]  I also think it also makes sense to me because something like what they intend to call it in marketing
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:34.360]  Is exactly the sort of thing that whatever the sources in taiwan who told them this would have no access to whatsoever, right?
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:41.720]  Because they're you know, that's just the sort of thing that doesn't that really doesn't leak out of cupertino because there's no reason for it
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:48.760]  You know, they just know the code name for it, you know, like the the the the companies in asia just know something
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:51.960]  You know, it's called like n68 or something like that. Yeah
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.960]  So what's the current so the current difference between the air and the pro is mostly is the retina
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.840]  Display and it's actually very complicated
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:10.360]  It's a really like if you just had to buy one right now today, it's to me a very complicated decision. So
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.200]  Aesthetically the retina screen is the biggest difference
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:17.400]  And so if you really want a retina screen, then you're going to get the regular macbook
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:22.440]  But the air even though it's cheaper is faster. It has it has higher performance
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:31.240]  Huh, I wasn't aware of that I guess because i've never i've never looked at them. I haven't looked at a macbook pro
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.000]  and
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.480]  In interest of buying one in years, right?
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:39.080]  Because i'm all like i'm
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:41.880]  You know i've been on the air for a while now. So
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:49.320]  A while now so and I actually am like recently i've been thinking i've got mine has been is from 2012. So i'm kind of thinking
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:52.760]  It's going to be time to upgrade soon
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:59.880]  This seems like kind of a bad time to do it. I think it probably is because I really don't think you want to buy
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:03.560]  You don't want to buy another macbook air without a retina screen, right?
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:08.680]  whatever the performance games would be and they're you know, three years is pretty significant, but it's
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:15.160]  It's I I think you could probably get by until they at least until you see what they come out with next year
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.440]  Yeah, and I don't yeah, right because I don't want to get a pro
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  and I feel like
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.080]  I somehow just have this feeling that the
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.000]  upgrade
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.160]  In next year's macbook is going to be significant
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.480]  Yeah, you mean the the the just plain macbook with no modifier, right?
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:37.400]  And I I just feel I don't know I I know nothing. I don't have any information about uh, well
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:43.800]  I just know nothing in general, but I know nothing about apple's product plans. I don't ask people to stuff like that anymore
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:47.400]  um, but just common sense wise it it
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:53.160]  I i'm almost certain that there'd be a new macbook next year and it's probably going to be a pretty significant upgrade over
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:57.160]  Last year's because a because last year's had a lot of very obvious flaws
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:00.120]  So there's low hanging fruit of how they can make it better
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.120]  and b
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:09.240]  It's the first generation of anything that apple is almost certainly to be able to improve it one year over another
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:12.940]  It's it's only when products have been around for three or four revolutions
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:18.440]  Where they might let it sit for 18 months between an update
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:22.600]  Because it's you know, they've they've gotten so good at doing blank
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.680]  That this this is good enough. This is actually going to be able to be
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:31.640]  Appealing to customers for you know, 18 months or even closer to two years. Yeah
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:39.720]  So, I don't know I think if they could if they could make the
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:48.700]  MacBook better next year and then maybe keep the same one that they started selling last year, but drop the price significantly
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:55.000]  Introduce a new one. That's better. Keep this one around at a lower price point
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:01.320]  And get rid of the air. Yeah, maybe they could get rid of the air and especially too. Maybe if they could if they can make the
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:03.080]  pros
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.280]  thinner
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:06.520]  Or in teardrops. Yeah, right to some degree
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:13.800]  And improve the performance of it right maybe like the 13 inch
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.760]  Or maybe the 11 inch air stays around just to hit that $8.99 price point whatever it is that it starts
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:26.200]  Well, yeah, it seems like the kind of thing that right it would be, you know, what we always call like the educational, right?
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.640]  Option, whatever the cheap right the cheap thing is
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:34.440]  Something that you really have you have to go into the store and like ask to see
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:44.460]  The starting price is for the MacBook Air right now 11 inch starts at $8.99 and 13 inch starts at $9.99
[01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:50.220]  So who knows if the MacBook could drop that much year over year, but it
[01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:54.140]  It maybe it could get close. What's it start at now? $12.99?
[01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:57.340]  Yes
[01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:59.740]  I just loaded the page, but I had to wait for Apple's
[01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:02.380]  Apple's excellent
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:03.980]  animation to
[01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:05.980]  To load before I could find it
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:12.220]  Um 12.99 so yeah, I really doubt that it's going to go from $12.99 to $8.99 in a year
[01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:16.780]  So I guess the air gets another year. No, there's no way there's no way it's going to go that low
[01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:19.180]  But they haven't always been that low, right?
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:24.620]  But I think they can I think they could set it up in a way where they don't emphasize it that much in the way
[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:27.020]  that they don't really emphasize very much the
[01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:30.460]  Free iPhone 5s
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:36.060]  Right that they give a lot of publicity to the you know to the new ones the macbook and the macbook pro
[01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:41.100]  And then there's the macbook air in the back, you know, yeah, but for a long time they started it
[01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:44.300]  Well, I mean they started it at $9.99
[01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:50.620]  And there may have been even a point where they started like 1100 the laptops. Oh damn well
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:53.660]  I mean they used to cost five thousand dollars. Well, yeah, I mean
[01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:56.620]  I mean, I think they started at $9.99
[01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:59.820]  I mean they used to cost five thousand dollars. Well, yeah, I mean
[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:02.460]  I don't mean that long ago, but
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:04.460]  and and it almost seems like
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:06.220]  I don't think they'd be
[01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:11.020]  Too adverse to going back to $9.99 when they have the ipad pro
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:15.260]  Hmm sitting in the middle, right? That's an interesting point that maybe they could
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:18.860]  Maybe they could get away with actually raising somebody somebody comes in
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:23.100]  They only want to spend x amount and they say well, how about how about this, right?
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:26.620]  Uh, because I you know, let's face it. Their heart isn't really in the
[01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:31.900]  The lowest possibly priced products on that's for sure
[01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:38.460]  Although I mean I would say I would say that the macbook air
[01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:41.100]  Of all of them
[01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:46.060]  Is of the all the lowest priced ones is probably not such a bad machine
[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:51.340]  No, it's not a bad machine. I just think though that you know being non-retina
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:53.340]  Being non-retina
[01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:58.060]  You know, it gets back to the whole argument that we you know had many times about
[01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:03.580]  Hey, what should apple do with the next generation iphone? Should they keep the same thickness?
[01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:08.940]  It's already so nice and thin and just miniaturize everything and put more battery in and extend battery life
[01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:11.980]  Or should they make the device ever thinner?
[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:17.420]  And apple tends to lean towards making it thinner and lots of people wish that they would just make the battery life better
[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:23.760]  That's exactly I mean bottom line putting the argument about just one usb port aside. I think that's ultimately
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:32.300]  The biggest complaint people have about the macbook is that the air was thin enough and that they should have just kept making battery life better
[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:34.700]  Yeah
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:41.180]  Wow, huh? Really people still complain about the macbook air battery life. It's pretty good now. It is pretty good. I guess
[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:45.820]  Yeah, but that they you know or that they could have as someone who does not have a current one
[01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:49.500]  I would well and maybe with the performance people don't know how good you have it
[01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:54.220]  Maybe maybe it's not even battery if maybe it comes down to things like performance that they would have had to go with this low power
[01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:56.220]  core m uh
[01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:58.300]  You know cpu they could have had the you know
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:03.980]  Just keep making the you know, just keep that form factor and just switch to a retina display and keep making
[01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:09.900]  The the performance better. I mean more or less. I think that what people wanted was for them to do a retina
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:15.500]  MacBook air. Yeah, and it looks I think it looks like they're never going to do it this no
[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:19.180]  I was this rumor we're talking about aside. I just don't see it. Yeah
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:23.100]  Yeah, I mean I agree. I think this is the the pro
[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:26.700]  Not the air yeah
[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:32.700]  It didn't say anything about colors. It'd be interesting to know whether the pro is going to go with like color options for uh,
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:38.620]  Charcoal, what are they called? No, not charcoal space gray space gray. Yeah, I would love to have space gray one
[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:44.060]  Yeah, I don't want I don't covet the macbook at all because it's
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:49.660]  It you know, I want more ram and I like having a macbook pro. Um, but I do covet the way that it looks
[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:51.660]  I love the space gray
[01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:54.700]  Yeah
[01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:56.620]  Although
[01:09:56.620 --> 01:10:01.900]  It starts it starts with eight gigs of ram. Yeah. Well, I have I think i've actually I have whatever the most is
[01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:05.020]  I think it's 16. Okay. All right 16. I have a lot of tabs
[01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:10.940]  It's all all browser tabs must be nice, um
[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:13.580]  Uh, let's take a break and let me show you along with four
[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:16.140]  let's take a break and let me tell you about a
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:20.380]  Long time friend of the show our good friends at igloo igloo
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:24.780]  Makes the internet that you will actually like
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:29.260]  The rise of web apps when web apps started to become a real thing in the late 90s
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:34.860]  It it crippled a lot of the software leaders of the previous generation
[01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:42.380]  It it crippled a lot of the software leaders of the previous generation and the tech industry today is going mobile and the same process
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:46.060]  Seems to be happening again where anything that isn't really mobile
[01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:51.180]  Isn't going to it doesn't work great on mobile isn't going to work for companies
[01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:54.380]  igloo
[01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:58.700]  Is an internet for your small team or your big team or your big company?
[01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:05.660]  Or your small company really does scale to any sort of size that you will actually like and it doesn't look like it was
[01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:09.980]  Designed in the late 90s. It looks like it was designed recently. That's because it was
[01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:17.020]  Uh, and it works great on mobile because part of what they've done is all this great responsive design for the stuff
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:21.900]  It's all web-based and it really does it scales for everything from a you know
[01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:27.500]  An iphone to a tablet to your you know, 30 inch or 27 inch iMac
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.500]  Uh really looks great
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:34.300]  Um really is easy to use and really does feel modern
[01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:38.460]  Which is not what you feel when you use a lot of existing internet software
[01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:44.220]  Things you can do you can ask access your task lip task lists
[01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:50.300]  Uh from a laptop during a meeting you can update your team on the progress of the most recent project from your phone
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:53.900]  Uh access the latest version of a file from home
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:55.740]  Uh
[01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:58.380]  And everything stays in sync because it's all web-based

[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.200]  Well, you want to talk about star wars at all?
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:05.760]  No
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:09.840]  No, okay, you know, I know you don't want to talk about I don't want to talk about I know you're yeah
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:13.600]  I don't know. I know you don't want to talk about. All right, so if we can do it without talking spoilers
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.360]  Then I will definitely talk about it
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.360]  well, okay, so
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:25.440]  Do you have tickets? I do. Oh, definitely. Okay, and you know, this is one where I really care and amy is sort of
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:26.800]  you know
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.040]  A vaguely interested but not like me
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:35.280]  Uh, and I didn't know you had to pre-order i'm i'm the dad who no longer understands how movies
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:39.620]  These theatrical movies work, you know, I mean like I remember when I was you know
[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:44.100]  Young and my dad found out that movies were five dollars, you know for like a kid's ticket
[01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:45.460]  And he couldn't believe it
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:50.420]  He just could you be you know, he just absolutely couldn't believe that five it cost five dollars to go to a movie
[01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:56.660]  I'm like that now both with prices like when jonas and I went to see uh, uh spectre
[01:13:57.780 --> 01:14:01.460]  And I I didn't know about this online ordering. It doesn't make any sense to me
[01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:05.700]  It seems to me like if you want to go see I just assumed that if you want to go see star wars on opening
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:10.660]  Weekend you got to go you got to drive somewhere and then you get out and you go wait in a big long line
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:12.420]  with lots of people
[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:14.660]  And after you wait in line, you go see the movie
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:18.580]  But it turns out what you need to do is buy your tickets in advance. I didn't know this amy did
[01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:20.980]  And really sort of saved my bacon
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:27.140]  So are you wait, are you saying you cannot buy tickets at the no you can but I think for opening weekend because yeah
[01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:33.700]  Yeah, because you'll never get in. Yeah, I don't I think you'll never get in unless unless they open unless they surprise people by having
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:35.220]  more
[01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:41.620]  Screenings of it than they're publicizing in advance. Yeah, um, which they might do because that seems like that would be
[01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:44.420]  I mean, uh
[01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:47.300]  Yeah train although they might pre-sell, you know
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:50.900]  Maybe you have to figure out the second pre-sale date to get in on those. I mean
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:57.940]  It seems as though it's it seems like it it might before it even happens that it might become the biggest box office
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:00.980]  Opening weekend ever. I think it's gonna be huge
[01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:04.660]  It's gonna be so I still so I think i'm out
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:09.300]  Oh because you don't have tickets because I don't have tickets. I don't have tickets yet. Well, so I
[01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:14.500]  I did my I my son doesn't like going to the movies that much
[01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:17.140]  He doesn't like going out to the movies that much
[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:21.060]  Um, and so I approached him with the idea of going to that and he at first he was going. Yeah
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.060]  And
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:28.820]  Then when I showed him the trailer he was a little more interested so I still haven't gotten like a firm
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:31.780]  firm commitment and
[01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:33.860]  I'm not exactly sure when we would
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:37.140]  Schedule this event. So I feel I feel like uh,
[01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:41.300]  Rushing out and buying tickets as I i'm like i'm not on an even footing yet
[01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:45.300]  Yeah, I wonder if they're if there's like a StubHub aftermarket forum like supporting events
[01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:50.500]  Like it seems crazy, but I I mean, it's absolutely insane how hard it was
[01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:54.580]  And it was one of those things where I did it the first night that they went on sale at the right time
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:59.300]  And really only I really I must say only because my wife is like are you gonna buy star wars tickets and i'm like
[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:02.100]  What are you talking about? And she explained to me and I immediately, you know
[01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:09.140]  Ran to I think it's fandango. Yeah. Yeah funny thing to say and it was like buying an apple product
[01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:12.500]  When they first go on sale like their website was going down
[01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:18.660]  You know, it was saying ridiculous things like yeah, that was the other thing like I couldn't actually get on fandango
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:24.820]  It was saying things like that the movie theater was didn't have any tickets available for a certain show
[01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:26.260]  and and
[01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:31.300]  Two minutes after they went on sale. I was like that can't be it can't be that they've sold out in two minutes
[01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:33.540]  and in fact, it wasn't but it was like they did
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:40.260]  Their back end was just completely blown apart and then the worst of all any kind of thing like this was
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:46.100]  When you're in like a mad rush to buy tickets is when you you get through you get the tickets you want
[01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:54.100]  And you're going through the process of like signing into fandango and then it just says like an error occurred
[01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:59.540]  And you're like do I have tickets or I do I not have tickets and you don't know
[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:03.300]  And it's hard to even check if you have tickets because their website is down
[01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:07.940]  And then you go and find out that no you don't have tickets yet. It was it was stressful
[01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:09.940]  but I do I have tickets for uh
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:17.940]  I think it's a 10 o'clock showing on thursday the night before it opens before yeah
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:23.220]  And i've already been told told that I will be I will be responsible for taking jonah's school
[01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:29.300]  Congratulations
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:36.020]  You're getting up early yeah, you're staying up late and getting up early and then I got I think I have saturday afternoon matt and
[01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:42.580]  I think I have saturday afternoon matt and a tickets at a it seems like a better theater like a place with reserved seating
[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:50.580]  Oh, so you have two sets of tickets I have two sets of tickets I have thursday thursday night and then saturday matt and a
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:54.100]  I was trying to find it
[01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:56.020]  I was going to show you the one of the things that you know
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:18:00.980]  When fang fandango was going down were they one of the images that in which you may have seen or may not have seen
[01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:06.260]  But one of the images that they showed was um was han and chewy like working on the millennium falcon
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:10.420]  So so it's like, you know like
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:15.460]  Something's gone wrong and it's like, you know, han's got the goggles on and they're like, they're like welding
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:19.700]  Welding the millennium falcon from like return or empire strikes back
[01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:22.260]  That's actually pretty funny. Yeah
[01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:24.740]  Nicely done
[01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:26.740]  You know, that's one of those things I have to re-watch
[01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:32.340]  I haven't I have not re-watched those films in a while at least ever since it was announced
[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:34.980]  That hey disney's buying
[01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:39.140]  Uh star wars and we're going to reboot the franchise or not reboot
[01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:44.580]  But uh, which I think would be terrible that would be like, you know, that would be like we're going to recast on solo
[01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:49.220]  No, that'd be awful. Uh, but you know relaunch it we're gonna you know
[01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:54.900]  We're we're doing the the trilogy that everybody always wanted to take place after you know, the one that you loved
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:56.900]  um
[01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:00.900]  I immediately just stopped watching all of them and I thought i'll just you know
[01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:06.100]  I'll wait and then whenever this movie actually comes out, you know, we'll have like a little family movie weekend
[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:08.180]  Then we'll watch all the old ones
[01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:10.820]  So i'm excited to do that
[01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:12.900]  including the prequels
[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:15.620]  Yeah, I think you have to include them. Oh god
[01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:18.340]  I don't know. It's so hard
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:22.980]  You know, that's an interesting thing. It's i've said this before on the show where it's i've noticed, you know
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:27.300]  And i've i've jonas has been watching them since he was ridiculously early. Um
[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:28.900]  young
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:30.260]  um
[01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:34.180]  He's never been a kid who's you know, he's sort of a very gentle kid in real life
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:36.980]  Um, he is not like a you know
[01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:44.980]  Get rammy and roughhouse, you know sort of a kid and so he you know, like dealing with like a violent action movie
[01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:47.860]  If you even even considering star wars is sort of violent
[01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:52.340]  Has never caused him to like act up in ways and it's never you know
[01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:56.580]  He was afraid of the rancor and oh and he didn't like watching the wampa he'd run out of the room for that one
[01:19:56.580 --> 01:20:00.420]  Every time yeah, but he you know, but he could handle that sort of thing too like you like
[01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:02.420]  So if they're like he didn't want to see the wampa
[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:04.340]  um
[01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:06.900]  But it wouldn't like keep him up at night or make him cry
[01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:09.140]  All it did is when he watched empire strikes back
[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:12.180]  He would just he knew when it was coming and he just ran out of the room
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:17.060]  And then he just sort of wait until he could hear that it was over and then he'd run back in
[01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:21.460]  Yeah, and he was fine. So we let him watch him early the thing I noticed was that
[01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:27.540]  They all blurred together for him as a kid and maybe you know, i'm sure somewhere if he's listening. Syracuse is
[01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:35.140]  Really angry at me that I didn't really strategize this aspect of my fatherhood that I just let him watch what he wanted to
[01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:43.140]  But my theory on that is that I just can't see if if you've got unlimited access to star wars movies that you can watch
[01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:45.140]  In your home on a nice tv
[01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:50.420]  I just couldn't I couldn't bring myself to not let him do it like it would have driven me nuts to
[01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:54.020]  When I was a kid if I could have had all the all the star wars you could eat
[01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:56.740]  To to not be able to do it
[01:20:56.740 --> 01:21:03.060]  So I let him do it and it blurred together and I noticed when he'd play with his friends early like kindergarten and first grade
[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:10.660]  A it impressed me and I really enjoyed the fact that his his he and his friends were really into star wars
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:13.940]  Not quite to the way that you and I were back in the day
[01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:19.460]  You know the way that really star wars was everything to me everything and yeah and you know
[01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:22.260]  77 through 83 or so
[01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:25.540]  It was the only thing that mattered
[01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:28.900]  It's not quite like that, but they were you know, it was more than just you know
[01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:32.260]  Well this week they're in the star wars and the next week they were into something else
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:35.540]  They were really into star wars for a while, but it all blurred together for them
[01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:39.540]  Like they just didn't see two two trilogies where one
[01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:43.380]  Was a lot better than another they just see it saw them all
[01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:49.220]  And I found that very odd. Yeah, that is interesting. Hank has never seen the the the prequels
[01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:56.020]  See, you're just like Syracuse. You're probably a better. I mean, I well I started out like that. I started out like no
[01:21:56.020 --> 01:22:00.660]  He's not gonna he's not gonna see them. Um, and then you know, we got through
[01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:02.740]  the
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:04.740]  you know, he's so he's seen all the
[01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:11.060]  The original movies a few times. Um, not relentlessly like I have but he's seen them a few times
[01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:13.220]  and then he got really into the clone wars the
[01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:20.580]  Animated yeah, he was and for him. That's really his star wars. I think yeah, but how do you really like that a lot?
[01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:24.900]  So why would you let him watch the the clone wars but not watch the prequels?
[01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:28.740]  I I think the clone wars the animated show is better than the prequels
[01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:35.060]  I I think the clone wars the animated show is better than the prequels. I I in in many ways I agree
[01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:40.820]  But I feel like they're of a piece because it's yeah clearly in terms of the timing, you know
[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:44.660]  it's it's entirely within the realm of you know, Anakin and and uh,
[01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:47.460]  Obi-wan, you know
[01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:50.180]  Being the buddy cops. Yeah
[01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:56.180]  But so as well so when Clone Wars ended, uh, I thought okay. Well, maybe now
[01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:58.660]  In this lull is the time to watch
[01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:04.580]  Uh the prequels and I got what I got like a fan at it. I thought if i'm going to do this
[01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:09.220]  I'm, at least gonna i'm at least gonna cut out as much jar jar as I possibly can
[01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:14.100]  Um, and so and I offered I said, okay, let's week we can watch the and he said no i'm okay
[01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:17.220]  you realize that this is this is a lot like
[01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:19.620]  It's a lot like
[01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:21.620]  a religious cult
[01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:27.700]  A religious cult right like where you're you're
[01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:33.140]  Using your son to not believe in jar jar. That's right
[01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:37.780]  Well, I don't think I don't think i'm wrong. I know jury in the world would convict me, right?
[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:44.420]  But imagine imagine how this could play out though over the decades where let's say he does agree to watch with you and you guys watch
[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:49.700]  Uh the phantom menace but you watch your fan edit cut
[01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:53.140]  And i'm not doubting that that fan edit cut is probably a better picture
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:58.740]  And must be it might be a really great experience if you've never seen the the lucas cut
[01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:05.460]  Yeah, but then imagine like 30 years from now where he sees the lucas cut and and he's talking to somebody, you know
[01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:11.700]  Of similar age and they're like remember that jar jar and he's like what the hell are you talking? He's only in it for like five minutes
[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:13.700]  Why are you real? Why are you really?
[01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:20.420]  Minutes why are you real? Why are you railing against jar chart? He's like in the background and he's not even doing anything
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:25.300]  Cut out all of his ridiculous antics
[01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:31.220]  Uh, I saw yeah, but so but so he didn't he didn't want us. He didn't want us. He was he was kind of done
[01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:37.060]  um, and then since like as I thought oh well after the the rebels thing that you know,
[01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:41.460]  I was like, oh he likes the the animated stuff. Maybe he'll watch rebels and now he's he's like no
[01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:44.660]  No, it's like he's moved. It's like he's moved on. Hmm
[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:49.700]  but he might be he might be getting he might be coming around to the
[01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:55.540]  To the movie though, so i'm hoping yeah, maybe you know, maybe disney might solve this problem for you
[01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:58.420]  but he'll they'll just bombard him with the marketing and
[01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:03.060]  That's right. Yeah and other kids at school too, right? Exactly
[01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:08.580]  I think that I think that might happen as well but also largely partly due to disney like I feel like disney has how to
[01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:13.460]  Do yeah, like it's a good thing disney doesn't try to sell cigarettes. Yeah
[01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:20.420]  He was in uh, yeah, really he was in the hospital, um for a few days. Um, and he's fine now, uh, but uh,
[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:22.980]  When he was well, he was sick
[01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:25.140]  Um, and this was just like last month
[01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:30.500]  Um, or no this currently still this month, but uh when this airs it will have been last month. Uh,
[01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:32.340]  he
[01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:34.740]  We started watching uh, james bond movies. Oh
[01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:40.020]  Which he had not seen before. Oh, um, and I had offered I think I had offered once or twice before and he was not
[01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:43.620]  You know, he had not he didn't really know enough james bond to be interested
[01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:48.740]  um, but I think one of them just ended up being on the hospital tv and he started watching it and
[01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:51.140]  liked it and so we watched
[01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:53.780]  I think we saw three of the
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:56.100]  Pierce Brosnan
[01:25:56.100 --> 01:26:01.540]  And then we watched both of the timothy dalton and a bunch of roger moor that was as far as we that was as far
[01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:02.820]  as we got
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:06.980]  um, but he's seen like now, I mean, you know in the past in the span of like
[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:10.420]  Three weeks he's seen
[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:13.700]  A great swath of james bond that he had never seen before and he liked him
[01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:17.460]  He thought that and and I think because he was sick. So when we got home
[01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:20.020]  I showed I started showing him
[01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:22.500]  um casino royale
[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:24.820]  and
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:29.240]  I think that it's updated and sort of more realistic
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:31.240]  Tone
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:35.640]  Was not as comforting to him as like the slow pace of the older
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:41.240]  Of the older ones like being sick. He wanted something that you know, he the the
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:45.480]  Roger moor running around and pants up to his chest
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:48.680]  In the 80s was kind of something that was kind of comforting
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:54.280]  Yeah, the roger moor ones and again, they're probably in hindsight and as time goes on they're my least favorite
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:59.560]  They're my least favorite. Um, but i'd love them though because they were the new ones when I was a kid
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:07.880]  Yeah, and and it's funny because to me as a kid the roger moor ones looked just crackled with newness
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:11.320]  like just like an unopened package from
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:16.520]  A company, you know like an unopened apple product, you know, like they just seemed new
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:20.760]  and the connery ones seemed old like in the way that like
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:24.200]  everything in star wars was meant to look old like the millennium falcon like
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:29.560]  And it's just ridiculous because it was only a difference of like 10 years, but I could just see the difference
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:34.840]  You know, I could see that the suits that connery was wearing aren't in style today, you know
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:41.240]  Whatever year 1979 or 80 or whatever. I was watching. I was like it looks so 60s. It looks ancient
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:46.120]  Because it just seemed to me like like when I was a kid when I was a 10 year old kid the 60s
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:49.320]  Seemed longer ago than they do to me today
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:51.320]  Okay
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:58.200]  Because when you're a kid your sense of time is so acute and your sense of newness and currency and
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:04.200]  Stuff like that and I just love the more ones but even in hindsight now that the more ones look dated
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:07.480]  And then I think probably are the most dated of any of them
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:11.960]  Because they were like the ones that I feel like were just the most faddish
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:16.060]  Yeah, his outfits and a lot of those are just hysterical
[01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:21.260]  Right in the even the early I mean even the earlier ones. Yeah. I mean by the time it gets to the 80s
[01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:23.340]  it's just he's just so old but it's
[01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:31.660]  It's kind of it's kind of painful. I I kind of excuse it because I think the 70s were a really odd decade
[01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:33.740]  where uh
[01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:37.980]  It would have been very difficult for them to to dress him
[01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:41.180]  in a in a more timeless fashion
[01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:45.340]  Like I feel like they you can get away with that and it wouldn't it wasn't it wasn't cool
[01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:49.180]  Yeah, it was so and it was so decidedly uncool that it just couldn't be done
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:55.260]  But overall the more ones to me they just go down like they just go down like ice cream on a hot day
[01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:59.340]  It just it just it you don't have to work to get into them at all
[01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:04.780]  Yeah, and they don't ask you to accept anything unpleasant
[01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:09.340]  You know, there's there's you know, like a nasty edge to the connery ones
[01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:11.580]  It's certainly in terms of the content
[01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:16.780]  There's nothing that it's really alarming and they're not particularly violent because of when they were made or at least in terms of
[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:19.020]  What's actually shown on screen?
[01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:26.220]  But there's a certain nasty undertone to to connery. Yes. Yeah. Yeah and moors, you know, it was
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:31.100]  Was much more relaxed. I've always said too like talking about these like one of the things is that with moore
[01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:33.580]  He played it in a way
[01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:35.340]  that
[01:29:35.340 --> 01:29:40.540]  There was a sense that he knew he was james bond and had already read the script and knew that he was going to he
[01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:43.100]  Knew that no matter what predicament he was in at the moment
[01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:47.900]  Hey, I know where the third act ends. I'm in a raft on the ocean with a beautiful girl
[01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:51.180]  You know, it's all going to be okay. Yeah
[01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:54.220]  Like
[01:29:54.220 --> 01:29:59.340]  He just always played it as a guy who had already read the end of the script and knew where this was going
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:03.180]  There's still I mean, there's something like there's one of them and I can't remember
[01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:05.660]  I want to say for your eyes only but like where he
[01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:11.580]  He slaps the female. Oh, you know the woman around
[01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:15.900]  And and you know, it's really kind of threatening
[01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:21.260]  To her and then you know, and then of course, you know, they end up
[01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:25.100]  It's like oh come on
[01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:27.900]  In the sack nice
[01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:35.500]  Nice. Yeah, that's our nodes. I don't remember which I they do all they they blur together, but it might be for your eyes only and I
[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:37.980]  it's
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:39.740]  it's a scene that seems
[01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:43.660]  you wouldn't have really thought well you might have it would have you would have thought twice about it, but
[01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:45.980]  It would have felt
[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:51.420]  Natural for connery's bond to do it and it really felt out of place with roger moore's
[01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:57.020]  Not even not even that roger moore as an actor couldn't do it, but it just didn't go along with
[01:30:57.580 --> 01:30:59.820]  The the rest of how he played the character
[01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:02.540]  right
[01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:10.060]  So just just just be clear here that you've
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:14.460]  Your parenting is such that you've never allowed your son
[01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:17.900]  To see the
[01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:21.660]  Yeah, yeah, this is why I draw the line jar jar binks
[01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:24.460]  You've drawn the line. That's too far
[01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:33.340]  James bond slapping one massage misogyny a-okay violent misogyny. Yeah
[01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:41.420]  All right, let me take a break here before we wrap it up I have one more one more sponsor to thank and it's our
[01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:44.700]  Good friends at harry's now. Here's the thing. This is the time of year
[01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:50.700]  I get very stressed because you got to start buying gifts for people. I find gift giving and i'm not joking here
[01:31:50.780 --> 01:31:53.500]  I find it incredibly stressful. I never know what to buy anybody
[01:31:55.500 --> 01:32:00.060]  And I get all stressed out and then I put it off I procrastinate because i'm stressed out and then
[01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:07.100]  Come december 23rd or so. It's just a disaster and I wind up buying everybody's stuff from uh, you know
[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:09.020]  7-eleven
[01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:11.660]  Uh, i'm i'm really a terrible gift giver. Um
[01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:13.500]  It
[01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:14.780]  Here's an easy solution though
[01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:18.060]  If you can find anybody if you have anybody in your shopping lift who you might want to buy
[01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:25.900]  Like a harry's shaving kit for it's a great idea. It is really nice. It's great in every way because a it's a high quality product
[01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:33.740]  B it comes in great packaging so it looks nice and then you look like somebody who gives thoughtful well-designed stylish stuff
[01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:36.620]  uh and see it's really really
[01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:41.760]  Remarkably competitively priced way lower than shaving stuff from Gillette or anything like that
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:46.240]  So you got like a dad a brother a husband
[01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:52.400]  A boyfriend any kind of uh, maybe like even if your work has like a secret santa type thing
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:55.600]  Just go to harrys.com and check out their shaving sets. Um
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:58.560]  And if you don't have one yourself, you could do that, too
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:05.200]  They sent me their holiday set. They've got this holiday set and it's great
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:07.120]  It's great. I actually
[01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:12.480]  hadn't had a new harry's kit for years because they sent me the first one years ago when they first started sponsoring the show and
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:18.240]  I still have that same original harry's uh handle which still looks brand new
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:21.920]  uh, all i've ever done from them is just keep buying new blades because
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:27.600]  That's all i've ever needed to replace. Well, they sent me this harry this uh holiday set just so I could see it
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:29.680]  So I know what i'm talking about
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:36.640]  Uh, and it's great. It is everything I like about harry's. It's a great handle great blades comes with some shaving cream
[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:39.120]  Uh in a really really
[01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:43.040]  Gorgeously designed package again. I've said this many times before and I mean it
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:48.800]  It's the sort of packaging where I the pack rat in me hates to throw it out because it is so nice
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:54.000]  And it's even just little things like when you open their stuff. You don't have to like rip it open to do it
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:00.880]  it's all nice folding boxes that fold back together and it just makes you not even want to throw away the packaging go to
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:09.380]  Harry's.com remember my code talk show that'll save you five dollars off your first order and if you're doing this for the holidays
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:11.520]  They've got free

[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:42.400]  Uh, what else we got we got to wrap it up
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:48.400]  Seems like I I think I I think I was actually thinking of the man with the golden gun just to be clear
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:52.800]  Yeah, you know what now that you say that that makes sense that does make and and uh the one
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:56.320]  What was the other one I mentioned for your eyes only is the one that looks?
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:59.920]  Is looks like it has incredibly cheap production values
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:03.280]  Yeah, I think that was one I get that's the cheesiest of them. Yeah
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:09.360]  so the man with the golden gun ends with a climactic fist fight between roger moore and
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:13.760]  Herve villages who was who was uh
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:16.160]  a little person
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:21.040]  Right james bond chasing a little person around the the master bedroom on a yacht
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:26.400]  it's it's also got see that one has has not only does it have misogyny and it has like
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:29.200]  Racism played off for laughs
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:35.620]  Um because it's got that that southern sheriff guy in like thailand
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:40.080]  Right. Yeah, and some of the things that he says are just awful
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:44.960]  Oh god really bad, it's just terrible and
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:49.200]  That was an odd decision to bring that guy back because he's
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:56.640]  I guess people really the racist southern sheriff was so popular, right?
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:03.600]  Let's bring him back again. What was he in? What was the first one he was in?
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:06.960]  It was the the one with the paul mccartney theme song. Uh, uh
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:10.080]  Uh live and let die. Yeah, yeah and let die
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:16.480]  That they had to bring him back who they've brought back when they brought people back is always it's always interesting
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:19.200]  I can't believe you don't have star wars tickets
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:22.080]  i'm, probably gonna regret that but
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:24.560]  I'm regretting it already actually
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:30.720]  Um anything else trying to think if there's any other news this week, I don't really think so a little slow
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:33.280]  Did you read uh, did you see the uh, frasier spears?
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:35.280]  post
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:41.440]  No, what was it on ipad pro ipad pro? Yeah. Yeah. What do you say? Uh,
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:43.920]  let me uh
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:45.920]  Let me pull it up here
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:48.720]  Can the macbook pro replace your ipad?
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:55.520]  It's very clever. Oh, that's that's I can tell where he's going
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:57.680]  Yeah
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:59.680]  The rest of it basically goes
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:01.360]  along those lines
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:06.880]  Oh, I should send i'm gonna put this in the show notes, too. I don't I forget if I link to this on my site or not
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:12.400]  sometimes it's like when I have something to link to I forget if I ever get to it or not if it's not real important but
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:14.400]  there was a uh
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:20.320]  This sounds like it's exactly the same sort of thing. It's a review of a
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:24.240]  gasoline powered internal combustion engine car
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:33.680]  From the perspective of a tesla owner. Oh, my god. It is so great gas car. I don't know
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:36.880]  I'll put it in the show notes so you can find it there. Okay
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:41.760]  Uh, this sounds like it's of a similar angle, which is kind of genius
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:45.760]  I mean I just you've seen a lot of
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:52.480]  Posts about I mean particularly because the things that tim cook said about whether or not an ipad pro can be used for serious work
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:57.360]  And you've probably discussed this many times but um
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:06.080]  It seems it seems like that was something that we said a long time ago and people are still trying to make this an argument
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:14.320]  If you're an artist note taker or teacher you're going to really struggle without the native ability to use an apple pencil on the screen
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:21.200]  Oh, that's good, that's really good and how are you going to use it standing up you can't
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:23.760]  It's very difficult to use the macbook pro while standing
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:29.200]  Downright dangerous to use when when walking around
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  If you are a road warrior the macbook pro's total lack of cellular connectivity options would be a serious hindrance to a proud
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:47.200]  That's really good, oh, all right, that's that I don't think there's anything else
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:49.200]  There's anything else
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:53.280]  Unless you can think of something no
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:39:00.240]  Let's talk movies for another hour. Yeah. No, maybe not. Maybe next time. Okay next time. Uh
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:04.320]  John molts people can get all the molts they want. Uh
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:06.720]  on twitter
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:09.520]  And then some that's uh at molts
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:14.080]  And then they can see your uh, very fine website
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:21.360]  Very nice. Very nice website. Very also. It's also very fine. But it's but it's mostly very nice website at verynicewebsite.net, right?
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:28.240]  And uh your podcasts your regular podcasts are I do 48 podcasts
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:31.120]  You know what snell's got you beat?
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:35.600]  Oh, yeah, no snell. There's no there's no competing with snell. I've got a theory. I wanted to bring it
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:39.760]  Oh, he was just on the show and I thought about it and I just didn't want to I don't want to make him uncomfortable
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:44.160]  but I did it has occurred to me that snell might be a uh,
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:46.640]  Remember that movie the prestige?
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:52.320]  Uh, yeah. Yeah, and I kind of don't want to spoil it for anybody who hasn't watched the prestige
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:55.200]  But i'll just say that I haven't seen it in a while so i'll have to refresh my memory
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:40:00.480]  Yeah, but I think it might be a prestige type scenario if you know what I mean. Oh, okay
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:05.920]  It'll make sense to people who've seen the prestige. Okay. Okay, or should I just spoil it?
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:10.080]  Good. Well, I can't no you're not gonna do it. No
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:15.760]  All right, well then I won't yeah, do you know what though? You don't want you don't want star wars spoilers people don't want this
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:21.040]  Prestige spoilers, right? Uh, I do think I I should say this before I wrap up
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:24.880]  I keep forgetting to do stuff like this a lot of times. I want to tell people who listen to show
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:28.880]  I don't want to talk to you. I get so caught up talking to the guests that I forget to talk to the audience
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:31.040]  I want to talk to the audiences for a second and just say
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:33.120]  that uh
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:38.720]  I'm thinking about talking about specter on an upcoming show and it's not going to quite be the old way that it was with
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:42.000]  Dan where we really do like a point-by-point review of the movie
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.360]  But I just stuff I want to talk about it with with that and I haven't talked about
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:48.240]  Skyfall either
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:54.000]  But I might and so if you're thinking about you know, if you want to listen to it while it's fresh
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.960]  You should don't be in your and you've been procrastinating on going to the theaters to see specter
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:03.280]  You should stop and and you should your homework for the talk show is to go see specter
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:09.200]  Okay, I'll have to do that and then no one will be mad when I actually do it and then they they
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.160]  They can't is it gonna is it gonna be with jonas?
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:18.720]  I haven't decided that's a possibility. I mean I did go see it with jonas. It's a possibility
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:23.440]  I haven't decided what to do. It's got to be something different. That would certainly be different, but that would that would definitely be different
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:27.200]  Not unprecedented he's been on the show before yeah
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:31.280]  Yeah, it was pretty was pretty young when he did it too because it was back with all the way back with Dan
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:38.720]  Ever say this I've one time we were at Shake Shack here in Philly and this is like a year or two ago and and a
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:42.640]  Guy came up and he'd said hey, are you are you John Gruber? And then I was like, yeah
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:48.080]  Yeah, you know and he was like, oh I love your podcast and he turned right to jonas and goes and you were great on the podcast
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:50.240]  That was one of my favorite episodes that I've ever had
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:55.360]  And it was a very nice guy and it wasn't weird at all. He did it very very good
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:57.360]  Oh good. Very cool. That's nice. Yeah
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:00.320]  Do you see this thing? I got one more thing
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:05.280]  Do you see the thing with the Amazon the their new thing with the prime air drone?
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:13.440]  No, I have to put it in the show notes. It's they have they've released like a YouTube video and they've got
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:20.320]  Showing like they're they're they're the latest generation actual working prototype
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:26.560]  Prime delivery drone. Oh, this is their cyber monday thinner sir, or I guess but it's it's kind of cool
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:30.480]  What's cool too? I don't know how close they are to legally being allowed to
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:34.640]  To actually use this but they're saying that what is actually shown in the video
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:40.080]  It's not like they've it's like a CGI or anything. It's an actual device doing what they're saying is being done in the video
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:44.880]  Which in and of itself is cool because it's you know, it's a real thing
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:51.040]  But the really cool thing I thought and really interesting is that the video is narrated by Jeremy Clarkson
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:54.480]  The ex top gear host who? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you know
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:56.960]  right
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:02.400]  Had a couple of had a couple of drinks in a steak and and punched his producer. I don't I
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:07.760]  It happens. You know what it does happen. It does. I I don't know
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:11.120]  I'm I still feel like with that story and you know and then they had a what are the the
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:15.680]  What they call in England they sacked him. Um, because he punched his producer, you know
[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:19.840]  I say though you don't know I don't know that we've ever gotten a full story on that
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:22.720]  There are times when somebody needs a punch. So who knows?
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:25.600]  You do not know what he was driven to
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:30.720]  You don't know but it it makes for a great video though because obviously part of what made that whole thing
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:35.520]  Sensational is that top gear is a well-deserved and much beloved TV show
[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:40.000]  And this video is sort of done with that same sort of style and you know
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.320]  It just has it's not just because he's hosting it. It just has that same sort of feel and touch
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:48.800]  and it really it's it's something I never even considered when I found out that
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:54.800]  Amazon had won the bidding to to get Jeremy Clarkson to do it. I guess it's still as yet unnamed
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000]  car show for
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.040]  prime
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:01.040]  Video or whatever it is
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:06.560]  Um car show for prime video or whatever they call their their video service for for subscribers
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:12.080]  When they did that I thought okay, so now they're gonna get that what used to be called top gear
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:15.440]  They're gonna get it, you know, and you have to be a prime subscriber to see it
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:20.800]  I'm looking forward to seeing it didn't really occur to me that they would take use of that and sort of turn him into like
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:22.320]  an in-house
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:29.200]  Spokesperson and the same video team and to be able to do that which is incredibly valuable
[01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:34.960]  Because it's so good. It's so well done. I'll put the video in the show note, but it's it's really really good
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:38.480]  It's not just interesting. Like wow, they have a robot that can fly through the air and drop
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:41.520]  Packages at your house, which is a cool idea
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:49.120]  But I really think it's fascinating to me now that Amazon has the top gear host and production team as an in-house
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:56.080]  Marketing team like it really ups the value of their stuff. There's a I don't know if there's a rumor or what but they're
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:58.720]  Amazon's prime video mic is now
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:05.120]  Coming to the Apple TV. Yeah. Yeah, I should yeah if we prepared for the show. Yeah, right, right, right
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:07.120]  We should we could have talked about that for an hour
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:11.280]  Right, we'll just drop that at the end long story short
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:17.840]  Somebody wrote to Amazon to complain about the fact that there's no prime video app on Apple TV and they got an answer
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:20.960]  That didn't seem to go through like any sort of official channels
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:28.480]  But somebody sits at Amazon ropak and said that we're working on it. Um, which if true is good to know but
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:32.640]  I took that with a huge grain of salt because it did not seem to come from
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:38.080]  It just didn't show right official. Yeah, it seemed like somebody who was just like well like, you know
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:44.240]  We're working on it. Yeah, if we have an ipad app, I guess we're having an apple. I don't know it could happen
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:49.040]  But anyway, who knows I guess it's more hope though than we've had before so
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:54.240]  It's more hope though than we've had before so it would be nice if they did it because there's good stuff on amazon
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:56.240]  That you know is exclusive, right?
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:04.400]  What do they call this thing prime prime air video with jeremy clarkson, so i'll put that in the show notes, too. That's pretty good
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:17.680]  All right, john, okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Talk to you soon. Okay. Bye. Bye
