[00:00.000 --> 00:02.160]  I guess we should do the first segment on the M1 stuff,
[00:02.160 --> 00:04.040]  get it out of the way, and then blow the rest of our time
[00:04.040 --> 00:05.120]  on the phones.
[00:05.120 --> 00:07.040]  Yeah, I think that sounds about right.
[00:09.680 --> 00:12.080]  So with the Verge, you guys got all three.
[00:12.080 --> 00:16.840]  You took the Pro, Dieter took the MacBook Air,
[00:16.840 --> 00:20.200]  and Dan Seifert took the Mac Mini.
[00:20.200 --> 00:21.080]  Chris Welch took the Mac.
[00:21.080 --> 00:21.920]  Chris Welch took it.
[00:21.920 --> 00:24.520]  All right, I knew I blew it on the third one.
[00:24.520 --> 00:28.320]  All right, but you guys did get all three.
[00:28.320 --> 00:29.800]  I had the MacBook Pro.
[00:29.800 --> 00:30.480]  I still have it.
[00:30.480 --> 00:33.600]  I'm still amazed by it.
[00:33.600 --> 00:41.240]  And I kind of feel like this was a case where,
[00:41.240 --> 00:44.280]  did you see the review that Patrick Moore had,
[00:44.280 --> 00:46.880]  quote unquote, review that he put on Forbes?
[00:46.880 --> 00:49.000]  It's like part of the Forbes Contributor Network.
[00:49.000 --> 00:53.760]  It was like the last honest man's review of the M1.
[00:53.760 --> 00:55.880]  Yeah, I mean, Pat and I have been talking back and forth
[00:55.880 --> 00:57.920]  a little bit about it, yeah.
[00:57.920 --> 01:00.800]  And I noticed that when he published it,
[01:00.800 --> 01:03.080]  and I think it took off in a way that maybe even he
[01:03.080 --> 01:06.480]  wasn't expecting, it got a lot of uptake.
[01:06.480 --> 01:08.160]  I think that's very true, that he was not
[01:08.160 --> 01:09.800]  expecting the reaction it got.
[01:09.800 --> 01:17.000]  And he toned it down a bit in post.
[01:17.000 --> 01:18.760]  There were quite a few references
[01:18.760 --> 01:25.520]  in the original version to Apple chosen reviewers.
[01:25.520 --> 01:28.160]  Let me give you my take on this as opposed
[01:28.160 --> 01:31.680]  to the initial reviews from Apple's chosen reviewers.
[01:31.680 --> 01:35.720]  And it was almost like he needed an editor
[01:35.720 --> 01:37.320]  because he mentioned Apple chosen
[01:37.320 --> 01:39.040]  reviewers too many times.
[01:39.040 --> 01:41.840]  But I did notice that in the uptake, that
[01:41.840 --> 01:44.040]  was what caught on, right?
[01:44.040 --> 01:46.480]  It was sort of like there are people,
[01:46.480 --> 01:47.720]  and I don't blame them, right?
[01:47.720 --> 01:52.200]  It's like cynicism and being jaded
[01:52.200 --> 01:56.760]  pays off probably more now than ever in our media world.
[01:56.760 --> 01:59.320]  And I think people thought, wait, these initial reviews
[01:59.320 --> 02:01.080]  sound too good to be true.
[02:01.080 --> 02:03.520]  And then Patrick Morehead's review comes out and says,
[02:03.520 --> 02:04.840]  they're too good to be true.
[02:04.840 --> 02:05.920]  Here's the truth.
[02:05.920 --> 02:11.840]  And well, then wait, why were all the reviewers so glowing?
[02:11.840 --> 02:17.360]  And it's because Apple picked people who would either.
[02:17.360 --> 02:19.840]  He never, you know, and it was definitely made where he never
[02:19.840 --> 02:24.200]  insinuated why Apple's chosen reviewers would write
[02:24.200 --> 02:27.080]  overwhelmingly positive reviews.
[02:27.080 --> 02:30.960]  But it played into people's just gut level suspicion
[02:30.960 --> 02:32.960]  that, hey, something's wrong with these reviews
[02:32.960 --> 02:36.280]  because they're saying things that don't add up.
[02:36.280 --> 02:42.480]  Yeah, I mean, this for me as a former gadget blogger
[02:42.480 --> 02:45.200]  is about as full circle as it gets, right?
[02:45.200 --> 02:49.080]  I would, when I was making $14 a post it in gadget,
[02:49.080 --> 02:53.040]  why did Ed Bigg and Walt Mossberg get the iPhone?
[02:53.040 --> 02:55.600]  It's because Apple has made some deals.
[02:55.600 --> 02:57.320]  And it's like, now I know Walt and I'm
[02:57.320 --> 03:01.640]  the guy who gets accused of, OK, well, you know,
[03:01.640 --> 03:04.520]  this is just the circle of life continues.
[03:04.520 --> 03:09.440]  But I did, Pat and I talked, we DMed a little bit.
[03:09.440 --> 03:11.960]  I think he tweeted that one thing that
[03:11.960 --> 03:17.520]  is really true about OS X or Mac OS, they call it now,
[03:17.520 --> 03:21.720]  that first day of a new Mac OS machine is shot for testing.
[03:21.720 --> 03:24.320]  That system just wants to index.
[03:24.320 --> 03:28.440]  It comes into the world and the first thing it wants to do
[03:28.440 --> 03:31.520]  is index itself as hardcore as it can.
[03:31.520 --> 03:34.120]  And so just for years, and probably they've
[03:34.120 --> 03:38.040]  told you this too, but I get a new Mac machine from Apple.
[03:38.040 --> 03:39.560]  And I'm like, my benchmarks are slow.
[03:39.560 --> 03:41.600]  And they're like, has it been a full day yet?
[03:41.600 --> 03:42.280]  I'm like, no.
[03:42.280 --> 03:42.960]  And they're like, wait.
[03:42.960 --> 03:45.360]  And then the next year a new one comes out and I forget.
[03:45.360 --> 03:47.960]  So I think that played a pretty significant role
[03:47.960 --> 03:49.520]  in the results he was getting.
[03:49.520 --> 03:53.520]  And then the other, and this is every computer is different.
[03:53.520 --> 03:55.400]  Everyone's workloads are different.
[03:55.400 --> 03:57.600]  It is a processor transition.
[03:57.600 --> 03:59.920]  There's a bunch of weird Big Sur stuff that's
[03:59.920 --> 04:02.080]  going on with compatibility.
[04:02.080 --> 04:06.800]  And then on top of that, and I'll say it as directly
[04:06.800 --> 04:09.320]  as I can, I don't use a bunch of Microsoft apps.
[04:09.320 --> 04:12.880]  I don't use a bunch of weird enterprise collaboration tools.
[04:12.880 --> 04:14.280]  The Vox Media is still a startup.
[04:14.280 --> 04:15.560]  We run on Google Apps and Zoom.
[04:15.560 --> 04:17.400]  And we tested what we tested.
[04:17.400 --> 04:22.640]  And Dieter and I are motivated to break the thing.
[04:22.640 --> 04:24.920]  We want to push it to its limit and tell you
[04:24.920 --> 04:26.720]  this is where we found the limit.
[04:26.720 --> 04:29.680]  And we were sort of unable to do that inside of our workflows.
[04:29.680 --> 04:35.120]  I think if I worked at a Fortune 500 company that
[04:35.120 --> 04:37.720]  ran on weird old custom Windows software,
[04:37.720 --> 04:39.800]  I probably would have broken it in a different way.
[04:39.800 --> 04:42.280]  So I did appreciate the shift in perspectives.
[04:42.280 --> 04:45.880]  But in talking to Pat, I mean, he can speak for himself.
[04:45.880 --> 04:48.400]  But I definitely got the sense that he was not expecting
[04:48.400 --> 04:49.440]  the uptake that he got.
[04:49.440 --> 04:50.440]  No.
[04:50.440 --> 04:53.200]  Well, I looked back at it.
[04:53.200 --> 04:56.240]  And I know what you're talking about, that one day.
[04:56.240 --> 05:01.120]  And for me, it's usually Spotlight and the Photos stuff.
[05:01.120 --> 05:06.480]  Because I have all of my photos in the iCloud Photos library.
[05:06.480 --> 05:09.960]  So I don't know, it's like up to 37,000 photos and videos.
[05:09.960 --> 05:12.080]  And even when you run Migration Assistant,
[05:12.080 --> 05:14.760]  there's some of the indexing of that stuff
[05:14.760 --> 05:18.160]  doesn't come over by choice.
[05:18.160 --> 05:20.120]  Spotlight doesn't come over, I guess.
[05:20.120 --> 05:21.080]  I don't know why.
[05:21.080 --> 05:24.160]  I think the Photos stuff doesn't.
[05:24.160 --> 05:27.200]  Perhaps it's for some sort of privacy reason.
[05:27.200 --> 05:30.160]  Perhaps they've talked about that they
[05:30.160 --> 05:35.840]  don't store some of the facial recognition stuff in the cloud.
[05:35.840 --> 05:38.920]  Or at least it's not supposedly in a way that they can get it.
[05:38.920 --> 05:42.120]  But anyway, Photos D or whatever it's called,
[05:42.120 --> 05:45.720]  something with a D, runs in the background, takes a lot of CPU.
[05:45.720 --> 05:47.720]  I found with this machine for the first time,
[05:47.720 --> 05:49.680]  it never made it hot, never slowed it down.
[05:49.680 --> 05:53.120]  And I was still getting incredible benchmarks.
[05:53.120 --> 05:54.880]  And I could see an activity monitor
[05:54.880 --> 05:58.320]  that this stuff was happening that usually wrecks a machine
[05:58.320 --> 06:01.960]  until you can look in activity monitor.
[06:01.960 --> 06:03.960]  And when you're not doing anything,
[06:03.960 --> 06:05.400]  the machine's not doing anything,
[06:05.400 --> 06:07.440]  OK, now's the time to start running benchmarks.
[06:07.440 --> 06:09.480]  And I didn't even see that.
[06:09.480 --> 06:12.000]  Again, am I accusing him of dishonesty?
[06:12.000 --> 06:16.800]  It just doesn't add up to what I saw, what other reviewers saw.
[06:16.800 --> 06:21.360]  And I think where he really had to tone it down a little bit
[06:21.360 --> 06:24.200]  was it didn't jibe with what just real people who now are
[06:24.200 --> 06:26.360]  getting them are seeing.
[06:26.360 --> 06:27.040]  Yeah.
[06:27.040 --> 06:29.920]  I mean, before we published our reviews, I texted Joanna.
[06:29.920 --> 06:33.120]  And I was like, we're real close to giving the Air a 10.
[06:33.120 --> 06:34.800]  Are we way out over our skis here?
[06:34.800 --> 06:36.720]  And she was like, no, I don't think so.
[06:36.720 --> 06:38.000]  That's remarkable.
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.680]  And we're not, again, we're motivated to find the limits.
[06:41.680 --> 06:45.880]  Because I think for me as a reviewer, one thing that we do
[06:45.880 --> 06:48.320]  is we tell you if it's worth the money.
[06:48.320 --> 06:50.600]  And one of the clearest ways to explain whether or not
[06:50.600 --> 06:52.360]  something is worth the money is to say,
[06:52.360 --> 06:53.800]  here's where your money will stop.
[06:53.800 --> 06:55.520]  Here's what you cannot do.
[06:55.520 --> 06:59.240]  And with the Air, we could find the line.
[06:59.240 --> 07:01.560]  Certainly, we could see it throttle at certain moments.
[07:01.560 --> 07:05.520]  But that line is so far above where
[07:05.520 --> 07:07.480]  any other consumer laptop at that price point is.
[07:07.480 --> 07:10.200]  It just made total sense to say this is great.
[07:10.200 --> 07:13.240]  I think now that people have, you
[07:13.240 --> 07:14.880]  can't hide from the truth, right?
[07:14.880 --> 07:17.400]  Like, people have the machines.
[07:17.400 --> 07:18.840]  They're going to run applications
[07:18.840 --> 07:20.360]  that aren't going to work.
[07:20.360 --> 07:22.360]  And Apple's claims are everything works.
[07:22.360 --> 07:23.960]  So there is a little bit of daylight
[07:23.960 --> 07:26.880]  there between what I think the most common experience is,
[07:26.880 --> 07:28.960]  what Apple is saying, and then what
[07:28.960 --> 07:32.040]  someone's absolutely bizarre edge case is going to be.
[07:32.040 --> 07:34.480]  And the question is just how much daylight is there.
[07:34.480 --> 07:37.240]  And it's like that was part of Morehead's review.
[07:37.240 --> 07:39.960]  It was like he listed some of the apps he was running.
[07:39.960 --> 07:42.400]  And I'd never even heard of them.
[07:42.400 --> 07:44.480]  It was like a bunch of Microsoft stuff.
[07:44.480 --> 07:48.000]  But some of the stuff he said, too, just didn't add up to me.
[07:48.000 --> 07:51.040]  I ran all of my benchmarks with Chrome
[07:51.040 --> 07:54.480]  with the Intel-compiled version of Chrome
[07:54.480 --> 07:57.440]  because I think that their first,
[07:57.440 --> 07:59.200]  I don't even know if it was still a beta,
[07:59.200 --> 08:02.800]  but they didn't have a native Apple Silicon version
[08:02.800 --> 08:05.640]  until the night before reviews came out or something
[08:05.640 --> 08:06.320]  like that.
[08:06.320 --> 08:07.640]  But I thought it was interesting.
[08:07.640 --> 08:09.680]  I thought it was an interesting test of Rosetta.
[08:09.680 --> 08:13.960]  It was like, well, Chrome is super popular.
[08:13.960 --> 08:16.240]  People use it for all sorts of things.
[08:16.240 --> 08:19.400]  So this is a great app to test.
[08:19.400 --> 08:20.720]  And it ran great.
[08:20.720 --> 08:24.760]  It wasn't as fast as Safari, but it was definitely
[08:24.760 --> 08:29.400]  as fast as Chrome is on Intel, brand new from this year,
[08:29.400 --> 08:32.160]  Intel MacBook Pros.
[08:32.160 --> 08:35.960]  Yeah, it ran all my tests in Chrome.
[08:35.960 --> 08:37.000]  Chrome is what I use.
[08:37.000 --> 08:40.160]  I think there's an element of being a reviewer where you
[08:40.160 --> 08:42.680]  can't just do what they tell you to do.
[08:42.680 --> 08:44.280]  You're like, no, this is my laptop.
[08:44.280 --> 08:46.440]  I'm going to use it like my laptop.
[08:46.440 --> 08:49.720]  And I run my workday in Chrome.
[08:49.720 --> 08:52.400]  And so I was really motivated to push Chrome
[08:52.400 --> 08:55.640]  because Chrome is a dog, even on the fastest Macs that
[08:55.640 --> 08:56.960]  have Intel chips.
[08:56.960 --> 08:59.760]  And here, it was, I think, a hair slower.
[08:59.760 --> 09:02.160]  And then I think the M1 build that they released,
[09:02.160 --> 09:05.840]  the Apple Silicon build, in a bizarre way,
[09:05.840 --> 09:06.840]  is definitely faster.
[09:06.840 --> 09:09.320]  But it's definitely still slower than Safari.
[09:09.320 --> 09:12.000]  Yeah, and like Slack, Slack came out
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.160]  with a beta that's Apple Silicon native.
[09:15.160 --> 09:17.680]  And again, I guess perhaps that's, I don't even know.
[09:17.680 --> 09:20.080]  I haven't followed that, if that's what all of Electron
[09:20.080 --> 09:20.600]  is doing.
[09:20.600 --> 09:24.540]  But the way that Electron is this native, quote,
[09:24.540 --> 09:28.200]  unquote, native app framework based on the Chromium engine
[09:28.200 --> 09:30.120]  and that Chrome, for now, is going
[09:30.120 --> 09:35.600]  to ship Intel and Apple Silicon versions as opposed
[09:35.600 --> 09:39.240]  to a universal download that runs natively everywhere,
[09:39.240 --> 09:42.720]  I guess, because it's so big and so much of it is compiled code
[09:42.720 --> 09:45.440]  and they're worried about the footprint.
[09:45.440 --> 09:50.880]  But I upgraded to Slack's native beta early, and it was fine.
[09:50.880 --> 09:55.160]  But I had been running the Slack Intel version for days
[09:55.160 --> 09:56.960]  on the machine, too, and it was fine.
[09:56.960 --> 10:01.120]  And I have lots of complaints about Slack as a Mac app,
[10:01.120 --> 10:02.640]  but it's not slow.
[10:02.640 --> 10:04.200]  It's never really slow.
[10:04.200 --> 10:09.000]  It's just bloated and uses weird UI conventions, really weird UI
[10:09.000 --> 10:12.560]  conventions, and it uses a lot of memory
[10:12.560 --> 10:15.920]  because it's based on Chrome.
[10:15.920 --> 10:18.000]  So the Moreheads review actually got
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.520]  me to uninstall the native beta I'd been using,
[10:20.520 --> 10:24.520]  go back to the Intel one, and I was like, no, this is fine.
[10:24.520 --> 10:26.080]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[10:26.080 --> 10:27.840]  I mean, maybe your Slack is different.
[10:27.840 --> 10:32.320]  I don't know, but the Slacks I'm on, this is amazing.
[10:32.320 --> 10:36.720]  Basically, I feel like we've thought for years,
[10:36.720 --> 10:38.160]  and there is, there still is.
[10:38.160 --> 10:40.000]  It's not like the M1 defies physics,
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.440]  but we know that there's a trade-off between how
[10:42.440 --> 10:44.680]  fast a computer runs.
[10:44.680 --> 10:46.280]  And you can just say computer.
[10:46.280 --> 10:49.640]  You don't even have to get into CPU, GPU, machine learning,
[10:49.640 --> 10:50.760]  et cetera.
[10:50.760 --> 10:53.520]  Just the faster it runs, the more energy it uses.
[10:53.520 --> 10:55.920]  The more energy it uses, the hotter it gets,
[10:55.920 --> 10:57.720]  and you run into heat problems.
[10:57.720 --> 10:59.720]  And so you can have cool computers.
[10:59.720 --> 11:02.720]  Basically, this is what we've accepted,
[11:02.720 --> 11:04.240]  you can have cool computers that are
[11:04.240 --> 11:06.880]  too slow for the sort of software people use
[11:06.880 --> 11:10.480]  on a daily basis, or you can have fast computers that
[11:10.480 --> 11:13.360]  run hot and have loud fans.
[11:13.360 --> 11:16.880]  And the M1 is saying, well, actually, you can have your cake
[11:16.880 --> 11:17.520]  and eat it too.
[11:17.520 --> 11:19.880]  Here's a computer that is actually very fast,
[11:19.880 --> 11:25.080]  and it single core competes with world-class desktop workstations
[11:25.080 --> 11:32.040]  even though it's shipping in $699 Mac minis and $999 MacBook
[11:32.040 --> 11:33.000]  Airs.
[11:33.000 --> 11:34.880]  It literally competes head to head
[11:34.880 --> 11:40.000]  on single core performance with multi $10,000 workstations.
[11:40.000 --> 11:45.120]  And it runs cool as a cucumber.
[11:45.120 --> 11:47.520]  And that seems too good to be true.
[11:47.520 --> 11:52.360]  It is a inflection point in the industry.
[11:52.360 --> 11:55.680]  There is no other chip, and it's not
[11:55.680 --> 11:58.440]  about ARM versus x86 instructions.
[11:58.440 --> 12:03.360]  There are ARM laptops, there are multiple AMD and Intel
[12:03.360 --> 12:08.240]  laptops, but there is no other machines that that's true for.
[12:08.240 --> 12:09.480]  Yeah, I think that's true.
[12:09.480 --> 12:13.000]  I wonder, over time, we're going to see.
[12:13.000 --> 12:14.480]  This is one of those questions you're never
[12:14.480 --> 12:16.000]  going to be able to answer until you
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.840]  see the performance curve of the chips over time.
[12:20.840 --> 12:22.720]  But there was a huge process transition
[12:22.720 --> 12:24.080]  that Apple just went under.
[12:24.080 --> 12:26.400]  It was the big shift to 5 nanometer.
[12:26.400 --> 12:29.400]  They're the first company to ship 5 nanometer at scale.
[12:29.400 --> 12:34.520]  Intel is still sort of struggling its way to 7.
[12:34.520 --> 12:38.160]  Those process transitions are where you get
[12:38.160 --> 12:40.400]  the leap in energy efficiency.
[12:40.400 --> 12:42.760]  And what we were always talking about
[12:42.760 --> 12:45.200]  was when the MacBook Air went to the Haswell chips
[12:45.200 --> 12:46.880]  and the battery life just skyrocketed.
[12:46.880 --> 12:48.240]  That's what this felt like to us.
[12:48.240 --> 12:49.760]  The performance is great.
[12:49.760 --> 12:53.240]  But the battery life jump is more meaningful for more
[12:53.240 --> 12:54.480]  people, I think.
[12:54.480 --> 12:56.640]  And so the real question is whether they
[12:56.640 --> 12:58.960]  reaped all those benefits at once because of the process
[12:58.960 --> 13:02.520]  transition, or they can keep scaling that over time.
[13:02.520 --> 13:05.920]  I don't know the answer, but it's
[13:05.920 --> 13:08.040]  like one of the big outstanding questions of what
[13:08.040 --> 13:11.440]  are the limits of what Apple made here is do they just pick
[13:11.440 --> 13:14.760]  it up this time because of an enormous and very difficult
[13:14.760 --> 13:18.280]  process transition that is years ahead of Intel,
[13:18.280 --> 13:21.280]  or is it baked into just sort of their architecture
[13:21.280 --> 13:24.200]  versus something like Snapdragon?
[13:24.200 --> 13:28.840]  And is there something to the fact of, I think there is.
[13:28.840 --> 13:31.800]  I think it's human psychology that there is something
[13:31.800 --> 13:38.440]  to having the bar raised that forces everybody to accept it
[13:38.440 --> 13:41.360]  and elevate their games.
[13:41.360 --> 13:46.120]  Like Steve Jobs famously described the original iPhone
[13:46.120 --> 13:48.200]  as being five years ahead of the competition.
[13:48.200 --> 13:52.160]  And that's such an abstract Bezos-Chardian thing,
[13:52.160 --> 13:54.760]  five years ahead of what?
[13:54.760 --> 13:58.080]  But in some sense, it was true.
[13:58.080 --> 14:00.040]  In some sense, you could say that it
[14:00.040 --> 14:02.440]  took about five years for Android phones
[14:02.440 --> 14:08.360]  to sort of just be in the ballpark in certain regards.
[14:08.360 --> 14:10.200]  But they did, right?
[14:10.200 --> 14:13.200]  And that's not me saying that Android phones within five
[14:13.200 --> 14:15.360]  years of the iPhone were equal to the iPhone,
[14:15.360 --> 14:19.160]  but they were certainly closer than other phones
[14:19.160 --> 14:21.840]  were in 2007, right?
[14:21.840 --> 14:25.480]  In 2007, it was like the iPhone, famously,
[14:25.480 --> 14:28.480]  it made the people at RIM after the announcement
[14:28.480 --> 14:29.920]  held a meeting the next day.
[14:29.920 --> 14:31.880]  And their conclusion coming out of the meeting
[14:31.880 --> 14:33.360]  of their executive leadership was
[14:33.360 --> 14:37.600]  that Apple had just lied and made up, said that the things
[14:37.600 --> 14:40.120]  they're saying that this iPhone does can't be true
[14:40.120 --> 14:44.000]  and sort of spent six months until they could buy one
[14:44.000 --> 14:49.520]  and see it spinning their wheels on that disbelief.
[14:49.520 --> 14:52.160]  But then RIM obviously didn't catch up,
[14:52.160 --> 14:53.080]  but the industry did.
[14:53.080 --> 14:58.440]  And I feel like the result is that Apple's laptop chips may
[14:58.440 --> 15:01.320]  not be so far ahead of the competition in a few years,
[15:01.320 --> 15:03.640]  not because Apple doesn't have the headroom,
[15:03.640 --> 15:06.400]  but because everybody's going to have to catch up.
[15:06.400 --> 15:07.600]  Yeah, I think that's right.
[15:07.600 --> 15:11.200]  I mean, when you talk about that phone, I sat through,
[15:11.200 --> 15:16.160]  I cannot tell you how many ill-fated briefings about why
[15:16.160 --> 15:18.920]  resistive touchscreens were superior to capacitive
[15:18.920 --> 15:19.520]  touchscreens.
[15:19.520 --> 15:21.400]  Like, it was just like horror.
[15:21.400 --> 15:23.000]  And I was like, you know it sucks.
[15:23.000 --> 15:24.000]  But that's what they had.
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.200]  That was like, that was the technology that was
[15:26.200 --> 15:27.720]  available to them at scale.
[15:27.720 --> 15:31.320]  Apple had their, you know, they were starting from zero
[15:31.320 --> 15:33.080]  and going to a small base so they
[15:33.080 --> 15:35.800]  could spend on superior technology that
[15:35.800 --> 15:38.040]  was harder to build, whereas the big companies just
[15:38.040 --> 15:39.320]  had access to it.
[15:39.320 --> 15:41.280]  It did wash out a lot faster.
[15:41.280 --> 15:43.280]  I think one of the big stories with phones,
[15:43.280 --> 15:46.000]  and you can see it actually with the M1, the big story
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.800]  here is that phones are such a huge market
[15:48.800 --> 15:51.400]  that they've commoditized all of these other little bits
[15:51.400 --> 15:53.200]  and bobs that make a phone.
[15:53.200 --> 15:57.360]  And so now you have an M1, which is just a supercharged phone
[15:57.360 --> 16:00.040]  chip that Apple has learned to build at scale,
[16:00.040 --> 16:03.440]  even through a difficult processor transition.
[16:03.440 --> 16:05.600]  You can just see how that will, like TSMC
[16:05.600 --> 16:07.440]  knows how to build 5-millimeter chips at scale.
[16:07.440 --> 16:08.960]  They make Apple's chips.
[16:08.960 --> 16:11.200]  They're going to sell that to all their other customers
[16:11.200 --> 16:11.720]  over time.
[16:11.720 --> 16:13.000]  And that's going to get commoditized.
[16:13.000 --> 16:14.320]  And Apple will stay ahead of the curve because that's
[16:14.320 --> 16:15.320]  the thing that they do.
[16:15.320 --> 16:18.640]  But I think that that catch-up period is a lot shorter
[16:18.640 --> 16:20.240]  than it used to be.
[16:20.240 --> 16:23.160]  See, and I don't think you're going to disagree with me,
[16:23.160 --> 16:26.080]  but I'm going to object to one phrase you just used,
[16:26.080 --> 16:28.040]  which is calling it a phone chip.
[16:28.040 --> 16:30.600]  And I think I'm as guilty of that as anybody,
[16:30.600 --> 16:33.360]  that we've all collectively believed that these are,
[16:33.360 --> 16:36.720]  that what Apple's been making with the A14, A13, A12, going
[16:36.720 --> 16:40.280]  back in time, are really, really good and ever better phone
[16:40.280 --> 16:44.160]  chips, because that's where they've been used.
[16:44.160 --> 16:49.040]  And the iPad, if we really want to just boil down
[16:49.040 --> 16:52.000]  what could be a two-hour episode easily of itself,
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.880]  what's wrong with the iPad is that it is still
[16:54.880 --> 16:58.240]  largely just a big phone.
[16:58.240 --> 17:03.000]  And limited by iPad OS, in many ways,
[17:03.000 --> 17:07.120]  based on limitations that make perfect sense for phones
[17:07.120 --> 17:10.280]  to preserve battery life and extend availability
[17:10.280 --> 17:13.840]  and this, that, and the other thing,
[17:13.840 --> 17:16.040]  that maybe don't make sense for the way people
[17:16.040 --> 17:20.960]  want to use iPads as personal tablet workstations.
[17:20.960 --> 17:23.640]  And we've internalized that.
[17:23.640 --> 17:26.320]  And then it's like, no, they're actually just good.
[17:26.320 --> 17:27.920]  They're just computers.
[17:27.920 --> 17:30.680]  Like, if you just sort of take a step back and stop thinking
[17:30.680 --> 17:34.160]  them as phones, as tablets, and laptops, and just think,
[17:34.160 --> 17:35.440]  well, they're all just computers,
[17:35.440 --> 17:38.560]  and they're instantiated in different form factors,
[17:38.560 --> 17:40.680]  they're just great computer chips.
[17:40.680 --> 17:43.920]  And it just so happens that they're making and selling
[17:43.920 --> 17:44.600]  most of them.
[17:44.600 --> 17:49.240]  And even by the standards of the iPhone 12 Pro Max,
[17:49.240 --> 17:53.880]  little, little tiny pocket-sized Unix workstations
[17:53.880 --> 17:57.400]  that you put in your, they're just great computer chips.
[17:57.400 --> 17:58.760]  So I agree with you.
[17:58.760 --> 18:01.400]  And I think if Dieter was here, he would be, like,
[18:01.400 --> 18:04.080]  shaking his fists at you that he's been saying they're all
[18:04.080 --> 18:05.960]  just computers for a decade.
[18:05.960 --> 18:08.160]  Because it's our expectations of what they do
[18:08.160 --> 18:09.840]  that define their limitations.
[18:09.840 --> 18:13.200]  I think what, again, this is prognosticating
[18:13.200 --> 18:15.520]  the roadmap of these chips.
[18:15.520 --> 18:17.320]  We'll see how it goes.
[18:17.320 --> 18:20.800]  Yeah, they are just all great computer chips.
[18:20.800 --> 18:24.440]  But the constraints, the design, customer experience
[18:24.440 --> 18:29.840]  constraints of a MacBook Air and an iPhone 12 Pro Max
[18:29.840 --> 18:31.760]  are pretty similar, especially because the phone is
[18:31.760 --> 18:33.200]  almost as big as a laptop.
[18:33.200 --> 18:35.920]  So you're still looking at battery life.
[18:35.920 --> 18:37.160]  You're still looking at heat.
[18:37.160 --> 18:40.360]  You're still looking at portability to whatever extent.
[18:40.360 --> 18:41.960]  You take that chip out of that context,
[18:41.960 --> 18:45.160]  where it has always sort of been designed for that context.
[18:45.160 --> 18:48.440]  And Apple will even tell you, we think performance for a lot.
[18:48.440 --> 18:50.960]  That's the metric, and we will never go beyond it.
[18:50.960 --> 18:53.400]  We're never going to break this ethos.
[18:53.400 --> 18:54.720]  And then you say, OK, we actually
[18:54.720 --> 18:56.720]  have to make a Mac Pro out of this.
[18:56.720 --> 18:59.000]  And people are actually still going
[18:59.000 --> 19:01.840]  to want external GPUs on that computer.
[19:01.840 --> 19:04.760]  And so we have to spin up PCI Express for this machine.
[19:04.760 --> 19:07.760]  Like, there's a bunch of stuff computers
[19:07.760 --> 19:11.440]  outside of this envelope need to do that we've never
[19:11.440 --> 19:12.920]  seen this architecture do.
[19:12.920 --> 19:15.720]  Whereas I think with the Air, and to some extent, the Pro.
[19:15.720 --> 19:17.680]  Actually, the Pro is a really interesting one
[19:17.680 --> 19:18.560]  we should talk about.
[19:18.560 --> 19:22.600]  But definitely for the Air, the sort
[19:22.600 --> 19:25.840]  of design constraints are so similar to what
[19:25.840 --> 19:28.440]  you want from an iPad that the OS letting
[19:28.440 --> 19:33.040]  you do more with it unlocks the chip in a very powerful way.
[19:33.040 --> 19:35.340]  What you want to do with a Mac Pro is totally different.
[19:35.340 --> 19:37.480]  And I think even the MacBook Pro to me
[19:37.480 --> 19:42.640]  is by far the odd man out of this entire lineup.
[19:42.640 --> 19:44.320]  I know why the Mac Mini exists.
[19:44.320 --> 19:46.720]  It's because people love it, and they can make one,
[19:46.720 --> 19:48.680]  and you can do all kinds of stuff with it.
[19:48.680 --> 19:50.680]  Why not put a fast chip in it?
[19:50.680 --> 19:54.800]  You can see why there's no Intel MacBook Air available.
[19:54.800 --> 19:56.040]  Like, why would you?
[19:56.040 --> 19:58.800]  The Pro is like, if you need the power
[19:58.800 --> 20:00.720]  that a fan gives you because you're
[20:00.720 --> 20:03.380]  rendering for a bit longer, you definitely
[20:03.380 --> 20:05.800]  want more than two ports.
[20:05.800 --> 20:08.200]  That's the one I'm like, why did they make that one?
[20:08.200 --> 20:09.960]  Yeah, and they've been making it ever
[20:09.960 --> 20:14.100]  since we were stuck without a retina MacBook Air.
[20:14.100 --> 20:16.600]  And famously, it was when they first
[20:16.600 --> 20:23.720]  introduced the two-port 13-inch modern Intel MacBook Pro.
[20:23.720 --> 20:26.040]  At the end of the introduction, Phil Schiller
[20:26.040 --> 20:29.120]  even said, by the way, some people
[20:29.120 --> 20:33.600]  have been waiting for a retina MacBook Air.
[20:33.600 --> 20:36.480]  Well, look at this 13-inch MacBook Pro.
[20:36.480 --> 20:38.920]  It actually has a smaller footprint,
[20:38.920 --> 20:40.720]  like stacked on top of it.
[20:40.720 --> 20:43.680]  It's actually smaller by volume, even though it's not
[20:43.680 --> 20:48.680]  wedge-shaped, and it's faster, and it starts at $1,300.
[20:48.680 --> 20:54.080]  And without saying, so this is the 13-inch MacBook Air,
[20:54.080 --> 20:55.040]  which it wasn't, right?
[20:55.040 --> 20:57.560]  They eventually did come out with a retina 13-inch MacBook
[20:57.560 --> 20:59.120]  Air, which is why he didn't say it.
[20:59.120 --> 21:01.320]  But a lot of people read between the lines and thought,
[21:01.320 --> 21:03.960]  oh, there's never going to be a retina MacBook Air.
[21:03.960 --> 21:05.760]  You're supposed to buy this, and they're just
[21:05.760 --> 21:07.440]  calling it a MacBook Pro.
[21:07.440 --> 21:11.240]  But it is one of the weirdest naming things in Apple's lineup
[21:11.240 --> 21:16.160]  because there's clearly, it sounds like a very subtle
[21:16.160 --> 21:17.000]  difference, right?
[21:17.000 --> 21:20.280]  You say to somebody who doesn't really know the details,
[21:20.280 --> 21:23.280]  well, some of the 13-inch MacBook Pros have two ports,
[21:23.280 --> 21:27.720]  and some which cost more, and they're faster,
[21:27.720 --> 21:28.920]  and they have four ports.
[21:28.920 --> 21:31.640]  And you think, oh, well, that's a natural way
[21:31.640 --> 21:36.920]  for a 13-inch Pro laptop to span the mid to high end, right?
[21:36.920 --> 21:39.400]  That some have two ports, some have four ports,
[21:39.400 --> 21:42.480]  and then the four port ones are faster chips.
[21:42.480 --> 21:45.400]  OK, but it's like two different product lines.
[21:45.400 --> 21:48.840]  It really, they should not have the same name.
[21:48.840 --> 21:52.240]  No other company but Apple would give them the same name.
[21:52.240 --> 21:54.480]  And they shouldn't, therefore, shouldn't
[21:54.480 --> 21:57.640]  have quite the identical form factor other than the ports
[21:57.640 --> 21:59.120]  either, right?
[21:59.120 --> 22:04.320]  And it's specific to the word pro, where it's just,
[22:04.320 --> 22:06.720]  you know, Apple uses pro.
[22:06.720 --> 22:08.680]  I keep hammering this over and over again.
[22:08.680 --> 22:09.800]  Apple uses pro.
[22:09.800 --> 22:11.280]  Sometimes what they really mean is
[22:11.280 --> 22:14.320]  what everybody thinks pro means, which means professional.
[22:14.320 --> 22:17.280]  And sometimes they just mean more expensive and nicer.
[22:17.280 --> 22:18.760]  Yeah.
[22:18.760 --> 22:20.200]  You know, it's like.
[22:20.200 --> 22:23.000]  But I would never, you know, this is like the old game.
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  Like, do you just spend the incremental money
[22:25.000 --> 22:26.400]  to have the slightly nicer thing?
[22:26.400 --> 22:27.400]  Is it worth it?
[22:27.400 --> 22:30.840]  And so with the iPhone 12 Pro, which
[22:30.840 --> 22:35.280]  is nominally what I am on this show to talk about.
[22:35.280 --> 22:37.480]  30 minutes deep in the laptop.
[22:37.480 --> 22:42.040]  But you know, I think the money to get the pro phone this year
[22:42.040 --> 22:44.520]  is like extremely well worth it.
[22:44.520 --> 22:49.040]  And especially if you're looking at the pro phone
[22:49.040 --> 22:52.120]  and you can deal with the size, the money to get the Pro Max
[22:52.120 --> 22:55.200]  is like a no brainer, assuming you can deal with the size.
[22:55.200 --> 22:56.440]  And all that's fine, right?
[22:56.440 --> 23:00.080]  Like, I just on my podcast decoder,
[23:00.080 --> 23:01.320]  we had Phil Spencer from Xbox.
[23:01.320 --> 23:02.520]  And I was like, why do you have two Xboxes?
[23:02.520 --> 23:03.920]  And he's like, the names are bad.
[23:03.920 --> 23:04.880]  We know it.
[23:04.880 --> 23:06.800]  But people walk into a store and they just see the price points.
[23:06.800 --> 23:07.560]  And that's all they care about.
[23:07.560 --> 23:08.840]  And you can understand it.
[23:08.840 --> 23:09.800]  So I totally buy it, right?
[23:09.800 --> 23:11.840]  With the phones, it's like you spend more money.
[23:11.840 --> 23:13.040]  You get one more camera lens.
[23:13.040 --> 23:14.400]  And then the phone gets bigger.
[23:14.400 --> 23:14.920]  Great.
[23:14.920 --> 23:15.920]  It makes sense.
[23:15.920 --> 23:18.040]  With the MacBook Air and the Pro,
[23:18.040 --> 23:19.920]  they're so similar that I would never
[23:19.920 --> 23:22.640]  spend the money to go from the Air to the Pro
[23:22.640 --> 23:27.080]  unless I had that need for sustained performance, which
[23:27.080 --> 23:29.440]  very, very few people do.
[23:29.440 --> 23:31.200]  And if I do have that need, I'm going
[23:31.200 --> 23:35.680]  to wait to see what the better pro looks like.
[23:35.680 --> 23:38.360]  Because I almost certainly need more ports.
[23:38.360 --> 23:40.640]  And I think, and this goes back to your,
[23:40.640 --> 23:42.360]  are they phone chips or computer chips?
[23:42.360 --> 23:44.400]  I have no idea what this thing looks like when it
[23:44.400 --> 23:46.240]  has more than 16 gigs of RAM.
[23:46.240 --> 23:48.040]  Because at 8 gigs, it does appear
[23:48.040 --> 23:50.640]  to be a little performance managed.
[23:50.640 --> 23:53.520]  Right.
[23:53.520 --> 23:54.080]  I don't know.
[23:54.080 --> 23:55.640]  I feel like they managed it right.
[23:55.640 --> 23:58.880]  I wish that these 13-inch MacBook Pros somehow
[23:58.880 --> 24:01.000]  could have a different name.
[24:01.000 --> 24:03.200]  I don't know what it would be.
[24:03.200 --> 24:03.840]  MacBook.
[24:03.840 --> 24:04.320]  I know.
[24:04.320 --> 24:06.120]  But they already spoiled that with the one.
[24:06.120 --> 24:07.520]  I'm not that Apple's supposed to.
[24:07.520 --> 24:08.560]  Like they care.
[24:08.560 --> 24:10.560]  Right, like they care about reusing names.
[24:10.560 --> 24:11.360]  But.
[24:11.360 --> 24:13.160]  Like what is a MagSafe connector?
[24:13.160 --> 24:14.360]  Like who knows?
[24:14.360 --> 24:16.200]  But I do think, I do kind of think
[24:16.200 --> 24:19.720]  that they misused the just plain no adjective MacBook
[24:19.720 --> 24:24.600]  name for the adorable little 12-inch no fan.
[24:24.600 --> 24:27.200]  This is what we'd clearly like to build.
[24:27.200 --> 24:30.120]  And we're trying our best with what Intel has to offer.
[24:30.120 --> 24:32.040]  But yeah, it's kind of slow.
[24:32.040 --> 24:33.120]  MacBook.
[24:33.120 --> 24:35.320]  But I still feel like that should
[24:35.320 --> 24:37.600]  have been like the MacBook Nano or something.
[24:37.600 --> 24:40.160]  Because like the most striking element about it was,
[24:40.160 --> 24:42.200]  oh my god, this makes the MacBook Air
[24:42.200 --> 24:44.640]  look thick and heavy and big.
[24:44.640 --> 24:45.880]  And it's tiny.
[24:45.880 --> 24:51.600]  As opposed to just plain MacBook should be like the iPhone 12.
[24:51.600 --> 24:57.920]  Not the 12 mini, not the Pro, not the Max, just the iPhone 12.
[24:57.920 --> 25:00.120]  This is like the main new iPhone.
[25:00.120 --> 25:03.200]  And then you can define all the other ones based
[25:03.200 --> 25:04.480]  on how they relate to it.
[25:04.480 --> 25:07.680]  That that, the 13-inch MacBook Pro
[25:07.680 --> 25:10.160]  should be the 13-inch MacBook.
[25:10.160 --> 25:12.440]  This is a MacBook.
[25:12.440 --> 25:15.040]  Yeah, I mean, I think you're running into the,
[25:15.040 --> 25:16.160]  well, you're doing fine.
[25:16.160 --> 25:19.320]  I think Apple is running into, they just
[25:19.320 --> 25:21.200]  have a billion customers.
[25:21.200 --> 25:24.200]  So they're not all, they have to consistently re,
[25:24.200 --> 25:25.440]  and they're very good at this.
[25:25.440 --> 25:28.440]  They have to reinforce and build on what people already know.
[25:28.440 --> 25:31.720]  This goes to your point about slow developer transition
[25:31.720 --> 25:32.840]  Apple Silicon, right?
[25:32.840 --> 25:33.960]  This year, you know this.
[25:33.960 --> 25:36.440]  Next year, we're going to give you one more fact.
[25:36.440 --> 25:40.440]  I think with the names, they're eager to reuse names.
[25:40.440 --> 25:42.040]  The front camera on the iPhone is still
[25:42.040 --> 25:44.080]  technically called the iSight.
[25:44.080 --> 25:44.720]  Is it really?
[25:44.720 --> 25:46.200]  I thought it was the FaceTime camera.
[25:46.200 --> 25:47.080]  I don't know.
[25:47.080 --> 25:48.600]  Everyone calls it the FaceTime camera.
[25:48.600 --> 25:51.800]  And Apple's like, our four megapixel iSight,
[25:51.800 --> 25:53.720]  it's like, I don't know what you're talking about.
[25:53.720 --> 25:57.600]  But I think they keep that consistency from year to year
[25:57.600 --> 26:02.640]  just because their market is so big that any change carries
[26:02.640 --> 26:04.160]  an enormous communication cost.
[26:04.160 --> 26:05.920]  And I think that's what happened with the Air.
[26:05.920 --> 26:07.360]  The Air was their most popular laptop.
[26:07.360 --> 26:09.520]  They tried to make it go away, and people kept buying it.
[26:09.520 --> 26:10.280]  So they're like, screw it.
[26:10.280 --> 26:11.400]  We're just going to make a new Air.
[26:11.400 --> 26:12.520]  Yeah.
[26:12.520 --> 26:15.520]  Yeah, and I kind of feel like they know things.
[26:15.520 --> 26:17.960]  They know some things about the people who buy them
[26:17.960 --> 26:21.240]  that they're never going to tell for competitive reasons,
[26:21.240 --> 26:23.800]  not just, oh, we're secretive, and we just don't talk.
[26:23.800 --> 26:26.080]  But you know, and I wouldn't be surprised
[26:26.080 --> 26:30.720]  if there's just a segment of the MacBook buying population who
[26:30.720 --> 26:34.760]  thinks of themselves as having, quote unquote, pro needs.
[26:34.760 --> 26:38.160]  And so they want a MacBook Pro, but they really
[26:38.160 --> 26:40.160]  they don't need a pro version.
[26:40.160 --> 26:43.800]  They need something that, you know, like $1,300.
[26:43.800 --> 26:46.520]  And so, OK, well, we'll give you one that has the pro name on it.
[26:46.520 --> 26:50.120]  And that way you'll buy it, even though, honestly, you
[26:50.120 --> 26:53.360]  wouldn't come close to taxing the MacBook Air.
[26:53.360 --> 26:54.440]  Yeah, I think that's right.
[26:54.440 --> 26:57.560]  And I think Apple is brilliant in just getting that extra little.
[26:57.560 --> 26:59.840]  I think that's the iPhone 12 Pro.
[26:59.840 --> 27:03.480]  It's a little bit better, but it costs substantially more.
[27:03.480 --> 27:06.720]  But if you're going to be there, you might as well be there.
[27:06.720 --> 27:07.960]  All right, we can come back to the MacBook.
[27:07.960 --> 27:09.680]  Let me take a break while I'm thinking about it
[27:09.680 --> 27:10.880]  and thank our first sponsor.
[27:10.880 --> 27:12.720]  It's our good friends at Linode.
[27:12.720 --> 27:14.760]  Linode, the company that hosts Staring Fireball,
[27:14.760 --> 27:15.880]  I love this company.
[27:15.880 --> 27:17.840]  You know, they're headquartered right here in Philadelphia.
[27:17.840 --> 27:18.760]  Great company.

[28:28.920 --> 28:32.360]  you can just swap it out with their S3-compatible APIs
[28:32.360 --> 28:34.760]  and host the stuff on Linode.
[28:34.760 --> 28:37.160]  They've got managed Kubernetes, which
[28:37.160 --> 28:40.600]  I keep being told I am pronouncing right, and more.

[29:00.120 --> 29:05.240]  So basically, the bottom line of the M1 reviews,
[29:05.240 --> 29:10.040]  and I finally get into the bottom of reading them all,
[29:10.040 --> 29:13.000]  they've done something that seems too good to be true.
[29:13.000 --> 29:16.920]  It's super fast and runs cool, and they've
[29:16.920 --> 29:21.800]  got a translation system that is pretty fast.
[29:21.800 --> 29:23.720]  It's not magic.
[29:23.720 --> 29:26.920]  It doesn't run Intel as fast as native Apple silicon on this.
[29:26.920 --> 29:31.760]  But because the chip is so fast and the translation is so good,
[29:31.760 --> 29:37.640]  most stuff runs at like 70% the speed of native code.
[29:37.640 --> 29:43.800]  And because the chips are like more than 150% faster,
[29:43.800 --> 29:46.640]  it actually runs faster than most Intel Macbooks,
[29:46.640 --> 29:48.680]  even when you're running Intel code.
[29:48.680 --> 29:51.520]  And those seem to defy people's beliefs.
[29:51.520 --> 29:55.320]  People seem to think you can have fast chips or cool chips,
[29:55.320 --> 29:58.800]  and translation or emulation, whatever you want to call it,
[29:58.800 --> 30:02.440]  stinks and is riddled with compatibility errors.
[30:02.440 --> 30:05.640]  And even when it does work, it runs too slow.
[30:05.640 --> 30:07.600]  And none of those things are true.
[30:07.600 --> 30:09.560]  And I think people are having a hard time getting
[30:09.560 --> 30:11.280]  their heads around that.
[30:11.280 --> 30:15.680]  Yeah, the only thing keeping me from instantly buying an M1 Mac
[30:15.680 --> 30:19.200]  Mini, which I just love the Mac Mini.
[30:19.200 --> 30:21.680]  I've wanted one for some reason for a long time,
[30:21.680 --> 30:23.360]  and I've never had a good reason.
[30:23.360 --> 30:26.040]  And I need an M1 test machine, seems
[30:26.040 --> 30:29.240]  like a good enough reason, is that I hate Big Sur.
[30:29.240 --> 30:33.280]  And that's, you know, I just don't like the way it looks.
[30:33.280 --> 30:35.400]  And I have a long personal history
[30:35.400 --> 30:38.840]  of skipping OS X versions.
[30:38.840 --> 30:42.760]  I've done it almost subconsciously for like 10 years.
[30:42.760 --> 30:44.480]  I think I was like probably the last person
[30:44.480 --> 30:47.080]  to use Snow Leopard, like Apple was looking at their stats
[30:47.080 --> 30:49.160]  dashboard, like who's that one person?
[30:49.160 --> 30:51.080]  No, I think there were a lot of people
[30:51.080 --> 30:53.200]  who held on to Snow Leopard for a long time.
[30:53.200 --> 30:53.840]  It was great.
[30:53.840 --> 30:55.920]  And so this just Big Sur to me feels
[30:55.920 --> 30:59.720]  like they've got a lot of new ideas in this OS,
[30:59.720 --> 31:01.920]  particularly around notifications and control
[31:01.920 --> 31:02.760]  center.
[31:02.760 --> 31:05.200]  And I'm just going to wait for them to figure it out.
[31:05.200 --> 31:08.000]  And that is the only thing that would keep me from instantly
[31:08.000 --> 31:12.160]  buying one of these machines, because it turns out
[31:12.160 --> 31:13.560]  I get a lot of notifications.
[31:13.560 --> 31:15.600]  So to have that broken in any way for me
[31:15.600 --> 31:17.880]  is it's just a real mess.
[31:17.880 --> 31:20.280]  So that's literally it.
[31:20.280 --> 31:21.240]  That's the only thing.
[31:21.240 --> 31:23.240]  That, and I think you and Joanna have probably
[31:23.240 --> 31:25.280]  done like 45 rounds on the webcam.
[31:25.280 --> 31:26.920]  But that's like whatever.
[31:26.920 --> 31:29.840]  I have external webcams.
[31:29.840 --> 31:33.160]  But yeah, to me, it really comes down to these
[31:33.160 --> 31:35.120]  are great machines.
[31:35.120 --> 31:37.000]  There's a lot of new ideas in them.
[31:37.000 --> 31:39.880]  And one of those ideas, for me anyway,
[31:39.880 --> 31:42.140]  is just the workflow notifications
[31:42.140 --> 31:43.760]  has changed so dramatically with the OS.
[31:43.760 --> 31:46.000]  I'm not going to upgrade any of my Macs for a year.
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.960]  Yeah, I don't think there's any hesitation in my mind
[31:48.960 --> 31:52.440]  to say that the most disruptive thing about switching
[31:52.440 --> 31:55.800]  to an M1 Mac is Mac OS 11 Big Sur.
[31:55.800 --> 31:59.300]  And only in the exact same ways that it
[31:59.300 --> 32:03.040]  would be if you upgraded your existing machine to Mac OS 11
[32:03.040 --> 32:04.120]  Big Sur.
[32:04.120 --> 32:06.640]  No question in my mind that that's the most disruptive
[32:06.640 --> 32:08.240]  thing for most people.
[32:08.240 --> 32:12.020]  To me, Catalina was the one that I just never liked.
[32:12.020 --> 32:17.240]  And I didn't upgrade my main machine
[32:17.240 --> 32:20.520]  to Catalina until like August.
[32:20.520 --> 32:22.360]  And by then, it was mostly ironed out.
[32:22.360 --> 32:25.720]  And I didn't regret it.
[32:25.720 --> 32:28.680]  But that's almost like 10 months after it shipped.
[32:28.680 --> 32:30.720]  I was definitely not going to upgrade to Catalina,
[32:30.720 --> 32:32.040]  but it has one feature.
[32:32.040 --> 32:36.720]  One extremely, this is how precious I am about workflows.
[32:36.720 --> 32:39.160]  There's one thing in Catalina that made my workflow better
[32:39.160 --> 32:40.040]  than I upgraded.
[32:40.040 --> 32:42.920]  It's when you take a screenshot and that image drops
[32:42.920 --> 32:45.680]  to the bottom right corner, you can click on it directly
[32:45.680 --> 32:46.960]  and drag it into a window.
[32:46.960 --> 32:48.360]  Yeah, and do something with it.
[32:48.360 --> 32:51.280]  And do something with it right from that little preview.
[32:51.280 --> 32:53.200]  And you couldn't do that in the older version.
[32:53.200 --> 32:56.120]  I was like, well, crap, here I go.
[32:56.120 --> 33:00.640]  But I have to say, so I've only used Catalina full time
[33:00.640 --> 33:01.740]  since like August.
[33:01.740 --> 33:04.840]  And then I started splitting a lot of time with Big Sur
[33:04.840 --> 33:07.160]  on a test machine while it was in beta.
[33:07.160 --> 33:10.080]  And now that I'm using this, I have to be on Big Sur.
[33:10.080 --> 33:11.880]  And so I'm OK.
[33:11.880 --> 33:14.880]  And there are, again, talk about a two-hour episode
[33:14.880 --> 33:15.380]  of a podcast.
[33:15.380 --> 33:19.240]  I do have some complaints about the Mac OS Big Sur UI design.
[33:19.240 --> 33:20.880]  And I can't wait to write about them
[33:20.880 --> 33:23.080]  once I catch my breath on all this review stuff
[33:23.080 --> 33:24.840]  on Daring Fireball and hopefully try
[33:24.840 --> 33:30.280]  to get some of the attention of people who can fix it.
[33:30.280 --> 33:32.320]  But overall, I like it.
[33:32.320 --> 33:38.400]  And I kind of feel like it's a better take on this style.
[33:38.400 --> 33:40.200]  I mean, it's obvious what they're going for
[33:40.200 --> 33:45.360]  and what they've been going for with iOS 7-inspired Mac OS
[33:45.360 --> 33:48.200]  ever since whatever the version is.
[33:48.200 --> 33:50.800]  Mac OS 10.10 or 10.11, whatever it
[33:50.800 --> 33:55.080]  was when they first switched to something that vaguely looked
[33:55.080 --> 34:00.240]  like the iOS 7 look and feel, flat, flatter.
[34:00.240 --> 34:04.080]  And it's like it never sat right.
[34:04.080 --> 34:06.920]  And it's like those years, they switched.
[34:06.920 --> 34:12.720]  They wanted to get them on the same branding universe.
[34:12.720 --> 34:13.680]  I don't know.
[34:13.680 --> 34:17.120]  But they did it before they had the San Francisco typeface
[34:17.120 --> 34:17.840]  ready to go.
[34:17.840 --> 34:20.000]  So those first two years, the Mac
[34:20.000 --> 34:23.400]  was using Helvetica as the system font, which
[34:23.400 --> 34:24.400]  never looked right.
[34:24.400 --> 34:27.480]  It was just like, what is this?
[34:27.480 --> 34:29.840]  And it's like, you could use it for a whole year.
[34:29.840 --> 34:31.600]  And every time I'd look at it, I would
[34:31.600 --> 34:34.720]  think that just looks weird.
[34:34.720 --> 34:37.160]  That just doesn't look like a Mac system font.
[34:37.160 --> 34:39.760]  And it's not like, oh, I'm stubborn
[34:39.760 --> 34:42.120]  and I don't want the system font to ever change.
[34:42.120 --> 34:44.280]  What was it, Lucida Grande?
[34:44.280 --> 34:46.960]  I don't know how you pronounce it.
[34:46.960 --> 34:50.040]  It was Lucida Grande for the whole Mac OS 10 era
[34:50.040 --> 34:54.240]  from 10.0 through whenever they switched to Helvetica.
[34:54.240 --> 34:56.640]  But then as soon as they switched it to San Francisco,
[34:56.640 --> 34:59.200]  it was like, ah, ice water in hell.
[34:59.200 --> 35:01.120]  This is a font.
[35:01.120 --> 35:03.320]  Maybe it's not somebody's favorite font,
[35:03.320 --> 35:06.400]  but it's like, this could be the Mac system font.
[35:06.400 --> 35:08.880]  Nice.
[35:08.880 --> 35:11.120]  I feel like Big Sur, they went back
[35:11.120 --> 35:14.240]  and it was like they gave a different team of designers.
[35:14.240 --> 35:16.720]  They said, OK, forget about what we've been using
[35:16.720 --> 35:17.920]  for the last five years.
[35:17.920 --> 35:19.480]  Just forget it.
[35:19.480 --> 35:21.520]  Make a version of the Mac OS system
[35:21.520 --> 35:26.120]  that looks more inspired by the general look of iOS.
[35:26.120 --> 35:28.840]  And it's sort of like a retry at the same thing
[35:28.840 --> 35:30.880]  that they've been trying for five years.
[35:30.880 --> 35:34.080]  You're walking into it, man.
[35:34.080 --> 35:35.720]  This whole game, right, is to make
[35:35.720 --> 35:37.640]  the things look like each other so
[35:37.640 --> 35:40.920]  that the huge audience of iOS users
[35:40.920 --> 35:43.440]  feels comfortable and at home using a Mac
[35:43.440 --> 35:45.520]  and switches at a higher rate.
[35:45.520 --> 35:46.560]  That's what you want.
[35:46.560 --> 35:49.320]  You want it to be a seamless ecosystem.
[35:49.320 --> 35:52.520]  You know what the biggest holdup is?
[35:52.520 --> 35:55.000]  You touch an iPhone.
[35:55.000 --> 35:58.560]  And so you're showing people all of these controls
[35:58.560 --> 36:00.600]  and all of these interface elements
[36:00.600 --> 36:03.400]  that look like the things they used to touch,
[36:03.400 --> 36:06.040]  that are harder to use with a mouse than before,
[36:06.040 --> 36:08.280]  and you're not letting them touch them.
[36:08.280 --> 36:13.080]  That, to me, I spend more time, I bet if you measured it,
[36:13.080 --> 36:16.200]  I spend more time clicking in the upper right of my screen
[36:16.200 --> 36:18.200]  than anything when I use a Mac, because I'm closing
[36:18.200 --> 36:21.160]  notifications or I'm monkeying around
[36:21.160 --> 36:25.120]  with the Wi-Fi and the volume and audio inputs and outputs.
[36:25.120 --> 36:30.320]  I'm going to do not disturb, which is really easy on Catalina.
[36:30.320 --> 36:32.360]  All that stuff got harder, because all of it
[36:32.360 --> 36:35.360]  is meant for swipes, or it looks like it's meant for swipes.
[36:35.360 --> 36:38.960]  It's not meant for clicking, and it's driving me insane.
[36:38.960 --> 36:42.360]  Yeah, but that's, you know, and some of it,
[36:42.360 --> 36:47.080]  I think the stuff that, like the notification center stuff,
[36:47.080 --> 36:49.280]  definitely it's true, because they actually
[36:49.280 --> 36:50.800]  are the same widgets, right?
[36:50.800 --> 36:51.280]  Yes.
[36:51.280 --> 36:52.200]  Right?
[36:52.200 --> 36:54.400]  And that is a Swift UI thing.
[36:54.400 --> 36:58.200]  And I think it's working out pretty well,
[36:58.200 --> 37:04.320]  and it's sort of the first really serious test of Swift UI
[37:04.320 --> 37:05.640]  that Apple's doing.
[37:05.640 --> 37:08.440]  And it's just one of these transitions
[37:08.440 --> 37:09.920]  that has to take years.
[37:09.920 --> 37:13.560]  And no matter if 10 years from now we look back at it
[37:13.560 --> 37:15.960]  and we say, wow, the transition to Swift UI
[37:15.960 --> 37:20.640]  as the UI framework for Apple, wasn't that a breeze?
[37:20.640 --> 37:22.400]  And it's like you forget that it's
[37:22.400 --> 37:25.200]  like the first three or four years of Mac OS X,
[37:25.200 --> 37:28.760]  where it's like, while you were living it, it wasn't so smooth.
[37:28.760 --> 37:30.520]  It was actually kind of awful.
[37:30.520 --> 37:34.080]  And not that Swift UI is awful, but that it just
[37:34.080 --> 37:36.240]  wasn't deep enough to do anything useful.
[37:36.240 --> 37:39.360]  And now they've got these widgets that ship
[37:39.360 --> 37:43.760]  the same across platforms.
[37:43.760 --> 37:45.360]  And obviously, they have to be designed
[37:45.360 --> 37:49.280]  for touch on the touch ones and not for touch on the Mac.
[37:49.280 --> 37:52.880]  I just think I just don't see them
[37:52.880 --> 37:55.800]  going with that style of design for everything,
[37:55.800 --> 37:58.960]  because there are certain aspects of the Mac
[37:58.960 --> 37:59.960]  where it wouldn't work.
[37:59.960 --> 38:00.560]  I don't know.
[38:00.560 --> 38:04.560]  I don't see it as touch being the answer to the problems.
[38:04.560 --> 38:08.680]  I think the real question for Apple
[38:08.680 --> 38:14.320]  is that these machines are in many ways a chip swap, right?
[38:14.320 --> 38:18.400]  And that's how they manage the Intel transition to.
[38:18.400 --> 38:21.600]  You already know everything, tried and true design.
[38:21.600 --> 38:23.600]  They're just faster because of one part
[38:23.600 --> 38:25.840]  that we can identify, the chip.
[38:25.840 --> 38:28.440]  As you go beyond that, and you say,
[38:28.440 --> 38:30.040]  now we can build around the chip itself,
[38:30.040 --> 38:32.920]  and what can we accomplish, it feels natural
[38:32.920 --> 38:39.920]  that that endless iPad versus Mac conversation
[38:39.920 --> 38:42.280]  is going to get even harder.
[38:42.280 --> 38:46.600]  And the number of people who just
[38:46.600 --> 38:48.640]  want a touchscreen on their Mac because there's
[38:48.640 --> 38:51.080]  one game they want to play, and touch alternatives
[38:51.080 --> 38:54.520]  is a horrible way to play an iOS game on a Mac,
[38:54.520 --> 38:56.080]  that number is just going to grow.
[38:56.080 --> 38:58.080]  Whereas the number of people who value the iPad,
[38:58.080 --> 39:00.440]  because it's way more simple, is also going to grow.
[39:00.440 --> 39:03.920]  And I think that tension cannot be resolved by saying one
[39:03.920 --> 39:05.440]  has a touchscreen and one doesn't.
[39:05.440 --> 39:08.520]  Yeah, but if the screen doesn't detach like a tablet,
[39:08.520 --> 39:11.840]  I don't know that the games are going to be that fun anyway.
[39:11.840 --> 39:13.960]  Has any Windows laptop manufacturer ever
[39:13.960 --> 39:16.200]  just sent you a Windows laptop with a touchscreen?
[39:16.200 --> 39:17.280]  Nah.
[39:17.280 --> 39:19.840]  Yeah, but if one of them is out there listening,
[39:19.840 --> 39:20.520]  just make sure.
[39:20.520 --> 39:21.520]  What would I do with it?
[39:21.520 --> 39:22.760]  Just do it for a month.
[39:22.760 --> 39:24.040]  It's really nice.
[39:24.040 --> 39:26.880]  Even on Windows, and Windows 10 has gotten better over time.
[39:26.880 --> 39:27.880]  I mean, I use my iPad.
[39:27.880 --> 39:30.160]  But it is actually very nice to just swipe up on a screen.
[39:30.160 --> 39:31.800]  Nah, I use my iPad as a laptop.
[39:31.800 --> 39:33.000]  You use your iPad like that.
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.640]  Yeah, and I don't really, if the touchscreen stopped
[39:35.640 --> 39:37.400]  working when it was in the keyboard,
[39:37.400 --> 39:39.600]  I wouldn't even notice.
[39:39.600 --> 39:43.040]  Honestly, every once in a while, I touch.
[39:43.040 --> 39:45.040]  And I certainly don't play games while it's
[39:45.040 --> 39:46.320]  in that form factor, right?
[39:46.320 --> 39:49.560]  When I do play a game on the iPad, it's like I pick it up.
[39:49.560 --> 39:50.920]  It has to be detachable.
[39:50.920 --> 39:54.080]  And all sorts of other stuff has to happen.
[39:54.080 --> 39:57.440]  It's this weird, I don't know, I feel
[39:57.440 --> 40:02.560]  like you and Joanna and others who see this as coming
[40:02.560 --> 40:04.600]  are underestimating the way that Apple
[40:04.600 --> 40:07.320]  looks at these sort of things.
[40:07.320 --> 40:09.520]  I don't think Apple looks at it.
[40:09.520 --> 40:10.640]  Now, I could be wrong.
[40:10.640 --> 40:14.080]  Because according to my logic, Joanna and I went over this.
[40:14.080 --> 40:15.880]  By the same logic, they shouldn't
[40:15.880 --> 40:20.080]  have shipped the iPhone apps running on Big Sur
[40:20.080 --> 40:21.920]  at all, period.
[40:21.920 --> 40:24.720]  Because the basic idea is it should be very nice
[40:24.720 --> 40:29.560]  and designed for what it does from top to bottom, A to Z,
[40:29.560 --> 40:31.600]  or just not at all.
[40:31.600 --> 40:36.440]  And so if it's not designed for touch in every way,
[40:36.440 --> 40:39.640]  with every button, then you shouldn't have touch,
[40:39.640 --> 40:42.160]  even if touch would be nice just for scrolling.
[40:42.160 --> 40:44.440]  I mean, that's what Ben Thompson is always telling me,
[40:44.440 --> 40:46.480]  is even if it just worked for scrolling,
[40:46.480 --> 40:48.120]  it would be nice to just reach up and be
[40:48.120 --> 40:50.560]  able to flip your finger and scroll something.
[40:50.560 --> 40:52.880]  And I get it, that it would be nice,
[40:52.880 --> 40:55.840]  and that people do if they've spent time using
[40:55.840 --> 40:57.280]  another device that is touched.
[40:57.280 --> 40:58.840]  And then they sit down at the MacBook,
[40:58.840 --> 41:01.160]  and they see a web page, and they want to just scroll it.
[41:01.160 --> 41:02.800]  And they touch the screen, and they're like, oh, yeah,
[41:02.800 --> 41:04.480]  it doesn't work on this machine.
[41:04.480 --> 41:06.920]  But I'm telling you that Apple's way of looking at it
[41:06.920 --> 41:08.880]  is, well, wait, if we give you touch for that,
[41:08.880 --> 41:10.800]  you're going to want touch for everything.
[41:10.800 --> 41:12.640]  And the red, yellow, green buttons
[41:12.640 --> 41:15.600]  need to be made twice as big and put twice as far apart.
[41:15.600 --> 41:18.280]  And then that eats into the space, and et cetera,
[41:18.280 --> 41:20.280]  and so forth, all the way down the line.
[41:20.280 --> 41:22.080]  And how do you select text, right?
[41:22.080 --> 41:25.440]  Selecting text is still a nightmare on iOS.
[41:25.440 --> 41:28.520]  Yeah, I guess what I would say, and I'm almost certainly just
[41:28.520 --> 41:33.040]  recapitulating Joanna and Ben, is Apple is wrong.
[41:33.040 --> 41:35.640]  And by extension, you are too, John.
[41:35.640 --> 41:39.320]  And here's, like, people are smarter now
[41:39.320 --> 41:41.400]  than we give them credit for.
[41:41.400 --> 41:42.840]  And the idea that there are things
[41:42.840 --> 41:46.600]  that are good to touch on a screen interface and things
[41:46.600 --> 41:49.960]  where you want to use your more precise input method
[41:49.960 --> 41:54.840]  is not out of the realm of what people understand
[41:54.840 --> 41:56.320]  about computers anymore.
[41:56.320 --> 41:58.280]  And I think maybe Apple's still just
[41:58.280 --> 42:01.640]  gun-shy because every Windows touch experience for, like,
[42:01.640 --> 42:05.200]  two decades was horrible, and they never want to build that.
[42:05.200 --> 42:08.240]  But I just, Lightroom, beyond scrolling,
[42:08.240 --> 42:09.760]  I edit photos in Lightroom, like,
[42:09.760 --> 42:11.280]  at least three times a week.
[42:11.280 --> 42:12.880]  And when I do it on my iPad, I'm like,
[42:12.880 --> 42:14.600]  I just wish I had a mouse.
[42:14.600 --> 42:16.360]  And when I do it on my laptop, I'm like,
[42:16.360 --> 42:18.040]  I wish I could just pinch to zoom.
[42:18.040 --> 42:22.520]  And there's no reason that I can do that on a Windows PC.
[42:22.520 --> 42:25.200]  Right, or just smudge your finger over a face, you know?
[42:25.200 --> 42:28.760]  And it's funny because Lightroom editing is exactly a thing
[42:28.760 --> 42:32.680]  where it's like the computer world has come full circle
[42:32.680 --> 42:34.600]  to the way that, you know, that's like what dodging
[42:34.600 --> 42:37.280]  and burning was in, you know, like,
[42:37.280 --> 42:40.120]  that's the origins of the term in Photoshop is that,
[42:40.120 --> 42:42.280]  you know, people would actually, in a dark room,
[42:42.280 --> 42:45.800]  like, just rub the photo as it was developing
[42:45.800 --> 42:47.560]  to lighten the spot.
[42:48.720 --> 42:53.040]  Yeah, I mean, it just, I think they're on the path to it.
[42:53.040 --> 42:55.040]  I think Federighi said, why would,
[42:55.040 --> 42:57.600]  that's not even remotely on our mind,
[42:57.600 --> 43:00.160]  which I think is a classic example of saying,
[43:00.160 --> 43:02.060]  Apple saying something is a horrible idea
[43:02.060 --> 43:03.320]  right until they do it.
[43:03.320 --> 43:05.480]  And they're like, we did it the best way.
[43:05.480 --> 43:07.760]  I'm very much hoping they are setting that curve
[43:07.760 --> 43:10.000]  for the next, like I said, the evolution of the Mac
[43:10.000 --> 43:11.840]  is about to get very interesting.
[43:11.840 --> 43:13.520]  What does a touchscreen iMac look like?
[43:13.520 --> 43:14.360]  I don't know.
[43:14.360 --> 43:18.160]  But they've given themselves the ability to make that thing
[43:18.160 --> 43:19.920]  in a way that I don't think the Intel ships
[43:19.920 --> 43:20.760]  ever let them do.
[43:21.800 --> 43:23.940]  I don't want to get distracted by touchscreen arguments,
[43:23.940 --> 43:24.780]  but.
[43:26.640 --> 43:29.160]  Again, so about those phones.
[43:29.160 --> 43:31.120]  I will say this, here's the other thing.
[43:31.120 --> 43:33.960]  The other thing that I come back to,
[43:33.960 --> 43:37.560]  because my podcast machine here is this 2014 MacBook Pro
[43:37.560 --> 43:40.940]  that it's one of my most beloved computers I've ever owned.
[43:40.940 --> 43:43.640]  I still do love it, but it does get hot.
[43:43.640 --> 43:46.960]  It does have a fan that turns on less than most Macs,
[43:46.960 --> 43:48.100]  MacBooks of that era.
[43:48.100 --> 43:53.100]  But it's funny how just being in Mac OS still to this day,
[43:55.420 --> 43:59.360]  like using a computer,
[43:59.360 --> 44:02.920]  it was clear you were running a physical machine, right?
[44:02.920 --> 44:05.820]  And the older you go in history and the older you are,
[44:05.820 --> 44:07.120]  the more you remember it, right?
[44:07.120 --> 44:09.380]  Like floppy drives made noise.
[44:10.760 --> 44:14.080]  Spinning hard disks made some amount of noise.
[44:14.080 --> 44:15.460]  And if they made a lot of noise,
[44:15.460 --> 44:18.040]  then you knew you were in trouble, right?
[44:18.040 --> 44:23.040]  It was like a red alert back in the spinning hard disk era,
[44:23.480 --> 44:25.320]  especially when drives were less reliable,
[44:25.320 --> 44:27.160]  that if you started to hear a clicking noise
[44:27.160 --> 44:28.200]  from your hard drive,
[44:28.200 --> 44:30.680]  immediately save anything that wasn't saved,
[44:30.680 --> 44:34.180]  immediately back up as best you could
[44:34.180 --> 44:36.760]  because it was extremely high likelihood
[44:36.760 --> 44:38.280]  that your hard drive was about to go bad.
[44:38.280 --> 44:41.000]  Because it was making a physical clicking noise, right?
[44:41.000 --> 44:42.600]  A physical thing.
[44:42.600 --> 44:45.200]  Fans come on, heat is generated.
[44:46.680 --> 44:48.480]  When we used to have spinning disks
[44:48.480 --> 44:49.560]  and you could watch movies,
[44:49.560 --> 44:50.680]  you could put your hand over,
[44:50.680 --> 44:52.640]  you knew which side the disk drive was on
[44:52.640 --> 44:55.820]  because it spun and you could feel it.
[44:55.820 --> 44:59.320]  And it is sort of freaky.
[44:59.320 --> 45:02.560]  Even though we've had phones that don't have fans
[45:02.560 --> 45:05.400]  and iPads that don't get hot and don't have fans
[45:05.400 --> 45:07.580]  and do computer like things,
[45:07.580 --> 45:10.680]  when you're using a Mac and you're just used to,
[45:10.680 --> 45:13.720]  well, if I do this, if I export a video
[45:15.320 --> 45:16.860]  and it's a 10 minute video,
[45:16.860 --> 45:18.480]  I know that it's going to get hot
[45:18.480 --> 45:20.960]  and the fan's gonna come on and that doesn't happen.
[45:20.960 --> 45:22.720]  It is weird.
[45:22.720 --> 45:23.920]  It's just freaky.
[45:23.920 --> 45:25.700]  Like my story, I told this last week,
[45:25.700 --> 45:26.640]  but I have to tell it again,
[45:26.640 --> 45:29.200]  was I double checked with Jason Snell
[45:29.200 --> 45:30.800]  before I published my review
[45:30.800 --> 45:32.760]  to see if, because I couldn't make the fan
[45:32.760 --> 45:34.800]  come on the 13 inch MacBook Pro.
[45:34.800 --> 45:37.840]  And I had this panic moment of,
[45:37.840 --> 45:40.200]  I'd just written over a thousand words
[45:40.200 --> 45:42.520]  about how the fan doesn't come on for me
[45:42.520 --> 45:44.240]  and even when I'm trying to.
[45:44.240 --> 45:46.840]  And I thought, what if I have a lemon hardware unit?
[45:48.160 --> 45:49.760]  And he was like, no, it's really hard
[45:49.760 --> 45:50.760]  to get the fan to come on.
[45:50.760 --> 45:53.040]  And I'm like, oh my God, thank God.
[45:53.040 --> 45:54.100]  It was just panic.
[45:54.100 --> 45:58.340]  But it's just weird because I just associate Mac OS
[45:58.340 --> 46:01.400]  with a machine that in some ways,
[46:01.400 --> 46:04.000]  even though they've been getting lesser and lesser
[46:04.000 --> 46:07.180]  as fewer and fewer parts of the computer actually spin,
[46:08.160 --> 46:10.840]  they manifest themselves physically
[46:10.840 --> 46:12.680]  in a way that the M1 Macs don't.
[46:14.280 --> 46:17.040]  Yeah, I find it very hard to get the fan
[46:17.040 --> 46:18.320]  and the Pro to spin up too.
[46:18.320 --> 46:21.320]  I think we ended up doing very synthetic things, right?
[46:21.320 --> 46:25.160]  We ran Cinebench for 30 minutes on a loop.
[46:26.240 --> 46:27.420]  We have a render test we do.
[46:27.420 --> 46:30.320]  We render out the same review video.
[46:30.320 --> 46:32.920]  So we all download the gigabytes and gigabytes
[46:32.920 --> 46:35.560]  of project files and then render it out through Premiere.
[46:35.560 --> 46:37.920]  Towards the end of that, I could get it to do it.
[46:37.920 --> 46:42.280]  But again, it was just hard, right?
[46:42.280 --> 46:44.000]  It's just a difficult thing to do.
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.800]  And Dieter's MacBook Air on that same render test,
[46:46.800 --> 46:48.080]  which is very real world,
[46:48.080 --> 46:53.080]  in Intel emulation or in Rosetta translation in Premiere,
[46:53.460 --> 46:55.800]  which not even really supposed to do.
[46:55.800 --> 46:57.800]  His was only a little bit slower than mine.
[46:57.800 --> 47:01.840]  And the Air was clearly doesn't have a fan to spin up.
[47:01.840 --> 47:05.800]  So it's like the, even just the value of that fan,
[47:05.800 --> 47:09.080]  it really feels subjective.
[47:09.080 --> 47:10.720]  Where I think the actual difference for me
[47:10.720 --> 47:12.600]  in terms of a machine,
[47:12.600 --> 47:16.240]  and I think this is less M1 and more iOS versus macOS,
[47:16.240 --> 47:19.200]  the Mac will just tell you about itself, right?
[47:19.200 --> 47:22.080]  You can just open system profiler
[47:22.080 --> 47:24.560]  and like, it'll tell you that it doesn't have
[47:24.560 --> 47:28.560]  like a SATA port, like it just reveals itself to you.
[47:28.560 --> 47:31.240]  You can open terminal and like screw around
[47:31.240 --> 47:34.460]  and see actually how fast the cores are running.
[47:34.460 --> 47:35.920]  Whereas no iOS device ever does.
[47:35.920 --> 47:39.960]  And I think that, that abstraction to me
[47:39.960 --> 47:43.380]  is the last bit of this is a piece of hardware
[47:43.380 --> 47:45.800]  that I actually have control over.
[47:45.800 --> 47:48.640]  Whereas the things you're talking about hard drive, right?
[47:48.640 --> 47:50.680]  The hard drive starts clicking and you know,
[47:50.680 --> 47:52.920]  like I better get any hard drive or the fan spins up
[47:52.920 --> 47:55.960]  or the disc start reading, like you can hear that stuff.
[47:55.960 --> 47:59.300]  That was a very tactile sense of this is my machine
[47:59.300 --> 48:01.080]  and I'm responsible for it.
[48:01.080 --> 48:04.320]  And now as those like mechanical things go away
[48:04.320 --> 48:06.880]  in the sense that you have to change your engine oil
[48:06.880 --> 48:10.000]  on your computer or whatever starts to disappear.
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.320]  What's left is I'm still responsible
[48:12.320 --> 48:14.100]  for how this computer operates
[48:14.100 --> 48:16.760]  in a way that I've never felt that way about iOS
[48:16.760 --> 48:19.060]  and even to an enormous extent, Android.
[48:19.060 --> 48:23.740]  And it just, it just feels weird.
[48:23.740 --> 48:27.220]  It's like this weird world's colliding, right?
[48:27.220 --> 48:29.460]  It does, it is, there are many ways
[48:29.460 --> 48:31.300]  where you're using an M1 Mac and you're like,
[48:31.300 --> 48:33.940]  this is just like using an iPad.
[48:33.940 --> 48:36.940]  But only in the sense of it being a physical device, right?
[48:36.940 --> 48:39.140]  It's like your mental model of what you can do
[48:39.140 --> 48:41.540]  and how you expect things to go.
[48:41.540 --> 48:44.740]  Like you just don't expect that you can, you know,
[48:44.740 --> 48:48.360]  run a thing in the background and compile, you know,
[48:48.360 --> 48:51.940]  some big project that's gonna take 30 minutes in Xcode
[48:51.940 --> 48:54.420]  and just leave it hot, you know,
[48:54.420 --> 48:56.260]  command H it to put it in the background
[48:56.260 --> 48:58.860]  and just go about your business catching up on email
[48:58.860 --> 49:01.560]  and reading in Safari or whatever.
[49:01.560 --> 49:03.340]  And just know that it's still running
[49:03.340 --> 49:06.600]  as fast as it can in the background, you know?
[49:06.600 --> 49:07.780]  You just don't think like,
[49:07.780 --> 49:09.520]  you don't do things like that on the iPad.
[49:09.520 --> 49:12.740]  I mean, literally because there is no Xcode on iPad.
[49:12.740 --> 49:15.200]  But like when you put things in the background on iPad,
[49:15.200 --> 49:17.700]  you just expect that they get suspended,
[49:17.700 --> 49:20.860]  not that they keep flying, you know?
[49:20.860 --> 49:22.120]  No, beyond suspended,
[49:22.120 --> 49:25.460]  you expect that when you reopen the app, it'll reopen.
[49:25.460 --> 49:28.420]  Yeah, hopefully it's still right where I left off.
[49:28.420 --> 49:30.260]  And you know, for the most part in recent years,
[49:30.260 --> 49:32.240]  it has, you know, it's gotten a lot better at that.
[49:32.240 --> 49:34.220]  Things don't start over from scratch
[49:34.220 --> 49:37.460]  or if they do, the apps are written to, you know,
[49:37.460 --> 49:40.820]  to handle it in a way that it's almost indistinguishable
[49:40.820 --> 49:43.340]  from just having been suspended and reanimated.
[49:43.340 --> 49:46.060]  But it just, I don't know.
[49:46.060 --> 49:50.140]  My big takeaway from this is that the M1
[49:50.140 --> 49:52.020]  and the Mac experience just makes me think,
[49:52.020 --> 49:53.860]  well, what is going on with iPad?
[49:53.860 --> 49:56.180]  Like I'm more curious about the future of iPad
[49:56.180 --> 49:57.820]  than I am about the future of Mac,
[49:57.820 --> 50:00.140]  even though I have lots of exciting questions
[50:00.140 --> 50:03.120]  about what they could do with truly pro chips.
[50:03.120 --> 50:07.700]  It's like, it just really makes the iPad to me
[50:07.700 --> 50:11.660]  seem so hamstrung by its OS.
[50:11.660 --> 50:14.580]  Yeah, but that's the secret of the iPad.
[50:14.580 --> 50:16.580]  They could have launched the first iPad
[50:16.580 --> 50:18.380]  with an Intel chip, right?
[50:18.380 --> 50:21.260]  Assuming appropriate chip existed.
[50:21.260 --> 50:22.360]  They wouldn't have made a difference.
[50:22.360 --> 50:23.620]  The whole point was,
[50:23.620 --> 50:25.700]  here's a new form factor of computing.
[50:25.700 --> 50:27.940]  Here's a new set of assumptions.
[50:27.940 --> 50:29.620]  We're effectively starting from scratch
[50:29.620 --> 50:30.980]  and we're going to build up over time.
[50:30.980 --> 50:32.520]  And what they've built up to over time
[50:32.520 --> 50:35.540]  is something that looks almost exactly like a Mac.
[50:35.540 --> 50:36.700]  And now the Mac has the M1
[50:36.700 --> 50:38.060]  and they look even more like each other.
[50:38.060 --> 50:41.820]  And I think, yeah, maybe that thing you're talking about,
[50:41.820 --> 50:44.440]  that 12 inch MacBook that's just called a MacBook,
[50:44.440 --> 50:46.800]  maybe that thing just is an iPad.
[50:46.800 --> 50:47.640]  I don't know.
[50:47.640 --> 50:49.020]  At the end of the day,
[50:49.020 --> 50:51.260]  maybe there is a convergence point.
[50:51.260 --> 50:52.960]  You ask anybody at Apple about this
[50:52.960 --> 50:55.340]  and they just look at you like you're the craziest person
[50:55.340 --> 50:56.480]  to ever live.
[50:56.480 --> 50:58.100]  They're like, no one cares.
[50:58.100 --> 50:59.260]  People just buy what they want to buy
[50:59.260 --> 51:00.980]  and we make them all in the end.
[51:00.980 --> 51:02.140]  We're the richest company in the world
[51:02.140 --> 51:03.740]  and this plan has been working
[51:03.740 --> 51:05.540]  and these problems are all in your head.
[51:05.540 --> 51:06.780]  And I think to a certain extent,
[51:06.780 --> 51:10.660]  that is an enormous source of power for Apple.
[51:10.660 --> 51:13.820]  It's true that they make these things,
[51:13.820 --> 51:15.860]  they sell as many as they can make.
[51:15.860 --> 51:16.820]  On the other hand,
[51:16.820 --> 51:19.500]  there's just a lot of confusion right in that zone
[51:19.500 --> 51:20.780]  for regular people.
[51:20.780 --> 51:22.900]  And especially now when you can get a MacBook Air
[51:22.900 --> 51:25.920]  that goes for 12 hours on a charge,
[51:25.920 --> 51:28.740]  why would you tell anyone to buy an iPad?
[51:28.740 --> 51:30.540]  Yeah, and you can do it without,
[51:30.540 --> 51:33.780]  you can do it while using Chrome as your browser, right?
[51:33.780 --> 51:36.900]  And that to me is sort of the other-
[51:36.900 --> 51:38.060]  When you go to watch Netflix,
[51:38.060 --> 51:40.480]  you're not immediately sucked into a spiral
[51:40.480 --> 51:43.200]  of extremely weird politics.
[51:43.200 --> 51:44.040]  Right, right.
[51:44.040 --> 51:46.380]  You just do it, it's fine.
[51:46.380 --> 51:50.300]  Right, you just do it and it looks great.
[51:50.300 --> 51:53.740]  It takes complete advantage of the resolution
[51:53.740 --> 51:55.460]  of your screen and it's nice and bright
[51:55.460 --> 51:58.820]  and the video just plays and the machine doesn't get hot
[51:58.820 --> 52:00.780]  and it's like, ooh, I better not put it on my lap
[52:00.780 --> 52:04.780]  because it'll literally make my lap hot.
[52:04.780 --> 52:07.600]  It just runs, it just runs the way you think that it should.
[52:07.600 --> 52:11.540]  And it's like, yeah, actually watching a TV show on Netflix
[52:11.540 --> 52:14.500]  shouldn't tax your computer or like you said,
[52:14.500 --> 52:17.220]  get you into this weird politics of, oh, wait-
[52:17.220 --> 52:18.180]  There's not a button that says,
[52:18.180 --> 52:21.540]  please email Phil Schiller so you can subscribe in the app.
[52:21.540 --> 52:23.520]  There's a whole world where iOS actually
[52:23.520 --> 52:25.860]  has gotten more complicated than a Mac
[52:27.140 --> 52:30.100]  because of how they manage the application ecosystem.
[52:30.100 --> 52:32.800]  Right, I also do, I do wonder too though,
[52:32.800 --> 52:35.140]  and it seems like that is,
[52:35.140 --> 52:37.700]  before we leave off the Mac segment,
[52:37.700 --> 52:41.380]  I mean, they clearly are leaning on some of the,
[52:41.380 --> 52:44.020]  hey, here's the reason why we're letting iPad apps
[52:44.020 --> 52:46.900]  run on the Mac now is for video
[52:46.900 --> 52:48.860]  and they keep promoting HBO Max
[52:48.860 --> 52:51.100]  because you can get the HBO Max app.
[52:51.100 --> 52:55.860]  And it's so much worse than watching in the web browser
[52:55.860 --> 52:58.380]  other than the fact that the app lets you download
[52:58.380 --> 53:03.020]  for offline viewing and A, who's doing that now?
[53:03.020 --> 53:05.220]  I mean, I know that we're not gonna be permanently
[53:05.220 --> 53:08.620]  in a pandemic quarantine, but everything else about it
[53:08.620 --> 53:11.500]  is so much worse than just going to your web browser
[53:11.500 --> 53:15.340]  and typing HB and auto-filling the rest.
[53:15.340 --> 53:18.540]  And, you know, and again, like with Netflix,
[53:18.540 --> 53:21.420]  like people just know when they're on a laptop type thing,
[53:21.420 --> 53:22.460]  how do you get to Netflix?
[53:22.460 --> 53:24.360]  You don't go for an app, you just go to your browser,
[53:24.360 --> 53:27.640]  you type NE, it auto-completes, hit return,
[53:27.640 --> 53:29.840]  and there you are watching whatever show
[53:29.840 --> 53:31.000]  you were just watching.
[53:31.940 --> 53:34.460]  Yeah, you know, one of the funniest things,
[53:34.460 --> 53:37.060]  this is a total tangent, but, you know,
[53:37.060 --> 53:40.660]  we covered the rise and very fast fall of Quibi
[53:41.900 --> 53:44.620]  very closely, because it was, it's like this,
[53:44.620 --> 53:46.340]  here's a car crash, we're gonna look at it.
[53:46.340 --> 53:47.540]  And one of the problems they had was
[53:47.540 --> 53:49.900]  they didn't let anybody screenshot
[53:49.900 --> 53:51.340]  and make memes out of their shows.
[53:51.340 --> 53:52.980]  Like Julia Alexander at the Bridge
[53:52.980 --> 53:55.860]  wrote all this stuff about it, it was great coverage.
[53:55.860 --> 53:59.580]  And Tom Conrad, who was the CTO of Quibi,
[53:59.580 --> 54:00.820]  had an entire thread.
[54:00.820 --> 54:03.220]  We finally built a screenshot capability,
[54:03.220 --> 54:06.340]  but because of DRM, both at a technical level
[54:06.340 --> 54:08.940]  and our deals to use DRM,
[54:08.940 --> 54:10.380]  we can't just let you take a screenshot.
[54:10.380 --> 54:14.540]  We had to build an entire other iOS flow for screenshots.
[54:14.540 --> 54:16.900]  And I think they had to build one similarly on Android.
[54:16.900 --> 54:19.580]  On the Mac, people just open Netflix and Chrome
[54:19.580 --> 54:21.340]  and take screenshots.
[54:21.340 --> 54:24.500]  And that is like a huge earned media opportunity
[54:24.500 --> 54:25.340]  for all these shows.
[54:25.340 --> 54:29.460]  And I think that level of the, you know,
[54:29.460 --> 54:32.620]  the mobile operating systems are just built differently
[54:32.620 --> 54:35.920]  with different assumptions, with different capabilities.
[54:35.920 --> 54:39.140]  It, when you get to that point where
[54:39.140 --> 54:41.220]  what people wanna do is just take a screenshot
[54:41.220 --> 54:44.260]  of Tiger King and tweet it,
[54:44.260 --> 54:45.740]  it's way easier on a Mac.
[54:45.740 --> 54:49.760]  Like, by far, it does not require the CTO of a company
[54:49.760 --> 54:51.220]  to build a screenshot tool.
[54:52.180 --> 54:54.860]  And I think that stuff just keeps redounding to the map
[54:54.860 --> 54:57.300]  because I think people are just getting smarter and smarter
[54:57.300 --> 54:58.460]  about how to use computers.
[54:58.460 --> 55:02.240]  It makes total sense, it's just a progression of time.
[55:02.240 --> 55:03.880]  But eventually you're like, I just wanna do this thing,
[55:03.880 --> 55:06.780]  and Mac always lets you do it.
[55:06.780 --> 55:08.980]  And it's just such a crazy mindset, too,
[55:08.980 --> 55:10.300]  that it never got into it.
[55:10.300 --> 55:12.720]  That, hey, we can't even let people take a screenshot
[55:12.720 --> 55:14.820]  of one frame of the show because they might somehow.
[55:14.820 --> 55:16.660]  It's gonna reduce the value of Quibi.
[55:16.660 --> 55:17.660]  Yeah, I don't know.
[55:17.660 --> 55:18.700]  Like, yeah.
[55:20.060 --> 55:22.460]  Yeah, it's like, you know, it's like some version
[55:22.460 --> 55:25.420]  of the famous, you know, step two is dot, dot, dot.
[55:25.420 --> 55:27.000]  You know, step three is profit.
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.380]  But except in this case, it's like, one,
[55:29.380 --> 55:32.720]  allow them to take a screenshot of one of our shows.
[55:32.720 --> 55:34.340]  Step two, dot, dot, dot.
[55:34.340 --> 55:36.380]  Step three, piracy.
[55:36.380 --> 55:38.180]  You know, like.
[55:38.180 --> 55:40.020]  But it was just a screenshot, right?
[55:40.020 --> 55:41.360]  And it's like all they wanted to do
[55:41.360 --> 55:44.380]  is have a piece of artwork to put in their article
[55:44.380 --> 55:49.180]  or put in the social media post or just show a funny frame.
[55:49.180 --> 55:51.020]  You know, like, oh my God, this is so funny.
[55:51.020 --> 55:52.660]  Look at this, and here's a frame.
[55:52.660 --> 55:54.860]  And then maybe people would actually watch Quibi.
[55:54.860 --> 55:57.360]  Well, yeah, but this is true of Netflix, too.
[55:57.360 --> 55:58.640]  You cannot screenshot Netflix.
[55:58.640 --> 56:00.500]  You can't screenshot each, in their apps,
[56:00.500 --> 56:01.980]  on their platforms.
[56:01.980 --> 56:03.300]  And I think that is.
[56:03.300 --> 56:04.100]  Right.
[56:04.100 --> 56:07.580]  Right, that's because the video subsystems of those OSes
[56:07.580 --> 56:11.660]  were made for Hollywood, because those were the app developers
[56:11.660 --> 56:13.500]  that wanted to do it and address that audience.
[56:13.500 --> 56:18.900]  Whereas in a web browser on Windows or the Mac,
[56:18.900 --> 56:21.380]  those are just general purpose video systems.
[56:21.380 --> 56:23.580]  And the screenshot system was not architected knowing
[56:23.580 --> 56:25.060]  that that thing would exist.
[56:25.060 --> 56:30.740]  And this is just a long way of saying eventually
[56:30.740 --> 56:33.460]  that the iPad problem is going to be
[56:33.460 --> 56:36.260]  that it's built on all of those assumptions
[56:36.260 --> 56:37.920]  and looks exactly like a Mac that
[56:37.920 --> 56:40.900]  has none of those limitations.
[56:40.900 --> 56:47.900]  Right, and it'll be hard for it to grow as opposed to already.
[56:47.900 --> 56:51.860]  It's easier for the Mac to get simpler in certain modal ways
[56:51.860 --> 56:54.500]  if that's your use case and that's the type of user
[56:54.500 --> 56:57.020]  you are than for the iPad to get more complicated,
[56:57.020 --> 56:59.560]  because it's going to start running into those limitations
[56:59.560 --> 57:01.740]  that are sort of hard-coded into the way it works.
[57:01.740 --> 57:04.500]  Yeah, and I think that's, I don't
[57:04.500 --> 57:07.000]  say this is a problem, I think it's
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.740]  here's one of the most interesting challenges
[57:09.740 --> 57:13.140]  Apple as a company has, and then around it
[57:13.140 --> 57:17.260]  in the ecosystem of computer companies,
[57:17.260 --> 57:19.020]  it is fascinating to see people try
[57:19.020 --> 57:21.100]  to solve that problem faster, right?
[57:21.100 --> 57:23.500]  So Microsoft is way ahead of that curve with the Surface
[57:23.500 --> 57:24.660]  line.
[57:24.660 --> 57:26.200]  Whether or not you want to run Windows
[57:26.200 --> 57:27.780]  is another question, and whether that's
[57:27.780 --> 57:30.500]  going to work great with your phone, yet another question.
[57:30.500 --> 57:33.500]  But you look at any of the Surface products,
[57:33.500 --> 57:34.980]  and they are trying very hard to make
[57:34.980 --> 57:38.740]  that line as blurry as possible.
[57:38.740 --> 57:39.580]  Yeah, definitely.
[57:39.580 --> 57:43.460]  And even the names, again, I get so confused as to which
[57:43.460 --> 57:44.260]  one is which.
[57:44.260 --> 57:46.820]  It's like, wait, which one detaches?
[57:46.820 --> 57:48.900]  I don't know, Pro?
[57:48.900 --> 57:52.900]  Yeah, it's the same as any other Microsoft product.
[57:52.900 --> 57:54.220]  You know how you tell them apart?
[57:54.220 --> 57:55.980]  They're prices.
[57:55.980 --> 57:58.580]  It's like, why are your stuff like Surface Go, Surface Pro,
[57:58.580 --> 57:59.940]  Surface laptop?
[57:59.940 --> 58:03.380]  It's like, I don't know, one is $399 and one is $1,499,
[58:03.380 --> 58:05.700]  and that's how you know.
[58:05.700 --> 58:06.380]  Yeah.
[58:06.380 --> 58:07.860]  Anyway, the last thing I will say
[58:07.860 --> 58:11.500]  is that, to me, the most interesting thing about the M1
[58:11.500 --> 58:16.660]  hardware advantages is that they do manifest themselves
[58:16.660 --> 58:21.380]  even if you're not a Mac user, by which meaning
[58:21.380 --> 58:24.260]  that you don't use a lot of apps or very few apps that
[58:24.260 --> 58:27.420]  are the Mac apps, like maybe you don't use Apple's Mail app.
[58:27.420 --> 58:30.140]  You just go to Gmail in your browser,
[58:30.140 --> 58:32.020]  and maybe the browser is Chrome.
[58:32.020 --> 58:36.700]  And you do all these things that don't put you in the Mac world,
[58:36.700 --> 58:40.340]  and you don't use these things that Mac users know,
[58:40.340 --> 58:43.420]  and you're not familiar with the way standard shortcuts are,
[58:43.420 --> 58:46.500]  and so you're not weirded out by the weird moon man
[58:46.500 --> 58:50.100]  shortcuts in this app that you use that aren't Mac-like.
[58:50.100 --> 58:53.940]  But your computer does say MacBook, and it is Mac OS X,
[58:53.940 --> 58:58.660]  and the way that the M1 makes all that just work better,
[58:58.660 --> 59:00.340]  even though you're not a Mac user,
[59:00.340 --> 59:03.700]  is you're just a user who uses the Mac,
[59:03.700 --> 59:06.140]  is like a huge advantage for Apple.
[59:06.140 --> 59:08.260]  And I think it's going to be for a few years,
[59:08.260 --> 59:11.900]  where even if you just want to use Chrome mostly,
[59:11.900 --> 59:13.700]  it's really hard not to recommend
[59:13.700 --> 59:16.100]  like $1,000 MacBook Air as the machine to do it.
[59:16.100 --> 59:17.460]  Oh, yeah.
[59:17.460 --> 59:20.260]  Again, this was our huge debate over whether or not
[59:20.260 --> 59:22.940]  you give this computer a 10.
[59:22.940 --> 59:24.740]  We could have done it, and we would have justified it,
[59:24.740 --> 59:26.420]  and we could have done it.
[59:26.420 --> 59:28.380]  We were this close to doing it,
[59:28.380 --> 59:30.940]  and then we took one step back and said,
[59:30.940 --> 59:32.500]  well, this webcam is really bad,
[59:32.500 --> 59:33.780]  and we're going to ding it half a point.
[59:33.780 --> 59:35.340]  Like, that's it.
[59:35.340 --> 59:37.580]  And that is a huge jump.
[59:37.580 --> 59:38.900]  Really, what we kept comparing it to
[59:38.900 --> 59:41.260]  was that Haswell MacBook Air,
[59:41.260 --> 59:45.020]  where for three years, four years,
[59:45.020 --> 59:47.420]  every time Joanna reviewed a laptop at The Verge,
[59:47.420 --> 59:48.700]  the last line would be like,
[59:48.700 --> 59:51.340]  for $200 more, you can buy a MacBook Air.
[59:51.340 --> 59:52.380]  And that was the standard.
[59:52.380 --> 59:55.300]  And I think this new Air is easily the standard
[59:55.300 --> 59:56.820]  that everybody else has to hit.
[59:58.020 --> 01:00:01.620]  Yeah, and the one to compare everything against, you know.
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:03.100]  Anyway, let me take a break here
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.180]  to thank our next sponsor.
[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.740]  It's our good friends at Mint Mobile.
[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:08.940]  Breaking up with your old wireless provider
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:11.660]  just got a whole lot easier thanks to Mint Mobile.
[01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:12.660]  They were the first company
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:16.060]  to sell premium wireless service online only.
[01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:17.540]  And now Mint Mobile is introducing
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:20.900]  their unlimited data plan for just 30 bucks a month.
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:22.140]  Let that sink in.
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:24.180]  30 bucks, unlimited.
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:28.300]  How much are you paying for your current plan?
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:30.180]  Probably a lot more than 30 bucks.
[01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:31.780]  For people who hate their phone bill
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:33.300]  and are just ready to cut their ties
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.540]  with those big providers,
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:36.740]  Mint Mobile offers their premium plan
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:38.100]  for just 30 bucks a month.
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:40.900]  And by going online only,
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:42.700]  really, today, do you really wanna go
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:44.860]  into a phone carrier showroom?
[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:46.260]  Probably not.
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:48.220]  They've been online only from the beginning.
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:50.580]  It cuts out all the costs of retail.
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:54.420]  That's how they're passing savings on to you.
[01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:56.820]  And all of their plans come with unlimited talk
[01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.940]  and text and high-speed data
[01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:02.180]  delivered on the nation's largest 5G network.
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:05.740]  Use your own phone with any Mint Mobile plan.
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:07.460]  Just pop the SIM card in
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:10.020]  and you keep using your same phone number.
[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:11.260]  Just transfer it over.
[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:12.940]  You don't have to worry about any kind of hassle.
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:14.740]  You don't have to tell people you've switched.
[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:17.380]  Nobody'll notice except that your bill will be lower.
[01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:19.440]  And if you're not 100% satisfied,
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.820]  Mint Mobile has you covered
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:23.200]  with a seven-day money-back guarantee.
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.040]  Couldn't be easier.
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:24.880]  You sign up.
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.740]  They ship you the SIM card in the mail
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:28.500]  and that's how you get started.
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.020]  Really, easy to get started.
[01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.000]  30 bucks a month and they ship it
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.580]  right to your door for free.
[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:35.620]  Go to mintmobile.com.
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:39.620]  Mintmobile.com slash talk show.
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:42.380]  That's mintmobile.com slash talk show
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:47.380]  and cut your wireless bill to 30 bucks a month.
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:49.080]  It's time to talk iPhones.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:49.920]  iPhone 12.
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:53.540]  I have hardly talked about,
[01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:55.660]  number one, I don't do enough episodes on my show, probably,
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:59.300]  but number two, I just feel like I haven't caught my breath.
[01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:00.580]  I was hoping.
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:04.060]  I was like, please let Nilay be reviewing the 12 Pro Max.
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:06.620]  Please let Nilay be reviewing the 12 Pro Max.
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.240]  And I was so glad that you were
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:10.780]  because I knew that you would push it.
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:13.160]  And I just,
[01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:16.660]  I'm so averse to the size.
[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:17.700]  I was like, forget it.
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:21.260]  I'm spending my week where I had both the Mini
[01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:23.540]  and the Pro Max, mostly with the Mini.
[01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:27.260]  Because it's more of an interest to me.
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:34.060]  And it's like, if the 12 Pro, not Max,
[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:38.380]  had the same camera system as the 12 Pro Max,
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:40.720]  I guess that's what I would buy for myself.
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:44.900]  But I was like, I didn't, and I was like,
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:47.000]  I don't get this camera system.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.860]  Like, I see how it should be better,
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:52.540]  but my initial testing was like, I don't see it.
[01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:54.520]  I'm not seeing what's better about it.
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:57.100]  And then I read your review and it was like,
[01:02:57.100 --> 01:03:00.560]  yeah, there's some of that in here, and oh, I see.
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:03.940]  And like, your Twilight pictures really capture
[01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:07.380]  where it has some noise differences.
[01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:10.260]  I'm curious what you think now for several weeks later.
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:11.860]  Are you still using the 12 Pro Max?
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:12.820]  Mine is on order.
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:15.660]  It's on its way, but right now I'm using the review unit.
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:19.160]  And I haven't since I've had it.
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:23.420]  You know, it's still too big.
[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:26.660]  And I don't think it's like too big.
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:31.160]  It's not unreasonable, but it's bigger than the last one.
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:35.100]  And every time I pick it up, I'm like, this thing is,
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:37.300]  man, if I was still traveling, this would be it.
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:38.780]  I wouldn't even take a computer with me.
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:39.740]  It's that big.
[01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:44.380]  And so like, I think it's right at the edge.
[01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:46.700]  It's the first thing I think every time I pick it up.
[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.940]  This is right on the line of being too big.
[01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:50.860]  The next number up is seven,
[01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:53.740]  and a seven inch screen is a tablet screen.
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:54.740]  So it's right on line.
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:56.320]  In terms of the camera though,
[01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:59.340]  you know, I should have put this in the review.
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:01.620]  I didn't, it didn't even occur to me
[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:03.500]  that this is what I was thinking
[01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:08.500]  until I read Joanna's review and I saw Marquez's review.
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:12.060]  And so Marquez was like, these cameras are the same.
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:13.140]  And I was like, that's not at all.
[01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:15.300]  And I realized what was happening
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:20.140]  is what you actually get out of the Pro Max day to day
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:24.500]  is it'll just go at a faster shutter speed
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.560]  because it can crank the ISO higher.
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:31.140]  And that is, if you're a photo person that like makes sense,
[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:34.820]  but no one knows that that's how anything works.
[01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:36.380]  But at the end of the day, it's just a camera, right?
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:39.260]  It's got three numbers that it can monkey with.
[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:41.220]  It can monkey with the aperture,
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:43.940]  which is fixed on an iPhone, but on a regular camera,
[01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:45.880]  you get a faster aperture, you get more light.
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:48.840]  You can move the shutter speed around
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:52.140]  to let more or less light in, freeze motion,
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:54.020]  or you can monkey with the ISO
[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:56.940]  to make the sensor more sensitive to light
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:58.560]  and also generally more noisy.
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:02.700]  And like that, there isn't a camera in the world
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:05.340]  that doesn't follow that little equation.
[01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:07.660]  And all that's happening with the Pro Max is,
[01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:09.200]  I just pulled it up here.
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:13.280]  The regular iPhone 12 Pro has a top ISO of 5,808.
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:17.100]  The Pro Max has 7,616.
[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:21.040]  And so it's just, it's an enormous range for a phone.
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:25.500]  But all that means is it'll just click the shutter faster.
[01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:26.880]  And so if you were spending a lot of time,
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:29.540]  like I'd be taking a picture of a toddler at night,
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:32.260]  you're like, oh, these photos are way better.
[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:35.860]  But if you're doing well in reviewing phones, cameras,
[01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:38.460]  reviewing anything in the pandemic has been so hard.
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:40.140]  So all I'm doing is like running around.
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:43.800]  I'm like, here's a tree that they look exactly the same
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:46.660]  because that extra shutter speed doesn't buy you anything.
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:48.140]  And I think that's really, really hard
[01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:49.900]  for Apple to market, right?
[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:51.360]  Just the amount of explanation I just did
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:53.140]  does not fit into an ad.
[01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:55.220]  They're like 27% more light or whatever.
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:59.180]  And it doesn't mean anything except the ISO is less noise
[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:00.220]  at any given number.
[01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:06.340]  And that to me was like where it clicked in my head.
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:08.160]  Cause it's like, why, they wouldn't do this.
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:12.300]  Like I know, I know the way Apple thinks
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:17.300]  and there's no way that they would go through the effort
[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:21.380]  of shipping an entirely different physical camera system
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:23.660]  only in the Pro Max,
[01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:27.740]  if there weren't very practical advantages to doing so.
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:29.100]  I mean, it's just common sense.
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:32.300]  You don't have to be in operations with to think like
[01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:35.800]  it would be cheaper if they just put the same system in
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:39.500]  that the 12 Pro has cause then they could just mass produce
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:42.760]  the same one and it's obviously a little cheaper
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.260]  and just stick it in the big one,
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.400]  which is what they've been doing the last few years
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:49.620]  between the 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max
[01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:51.700]  and the 10 S and the 10 S Max.
[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:54.260]  It's just the same camera system in a bigger phone.
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:57.340]  But I wasn't seeing what it was
[01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:02.340]  and boiling it down to faster captures is exactly it.
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:04.020]  And that's why I wasn't seeing it.
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:06.740]  I don't have a toddler anymore.
[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:08.500]  I have a 16 year old who doesn't move.
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.460]  Yeah, playing Fortnite, right?
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.300]  Rock still.
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:13.740]  Yeah, let me get a, turn around,
[01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:15.740]  let me get a picture of you playing video.
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:17.980]  And even the sensor shifts, right?
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:19.340]  They changed the stabilization.
[01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:20.900]  They went from, it's optical,
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:22.980]  it moves the lens and the smaller phones.
[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:24.680]  On the bigger phone, they moved to sensor shift,
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:27.420]  which is very much like with Sony and Panasonic too
[01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:28.940]  and their mirrorless cameras.
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:30.660]  That's because the sensor's bigger.
[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:32.460]  I mean, I asked, I was like, what do you get out of this?
[01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:35.740]  Like, well, once the sensor gets to about this size,
[01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:38.140]  it's faster and easier to move the sensor.
[01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:41.460]  And like, maybe there's some little bit
[01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:45.100]  of performance advantage at the extremes of the scale,
[01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:49.000]  but they were like, look, the 12 Pro is a great camera.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.240]  And you should, you should like,
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:53.640]  its performance is good enough for us to ship it,
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:54.900]  which means it's very good.
[01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:57.820]  And so I think they just backed themselves into a corner
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:00.540]  in how they talked about this camera,
[01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:02.960]  because they want to tell you that the things
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:07.540]  that are the most resonant, which are faster shutter speed,
[01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:10.220]  captures more light, bigger sensor.
[01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:13.460]  And that just gives you a bunch of expectations
[01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:14.820]  that aren't there.
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:15.800]  And it's not their fault.
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.900]  Like when you hear bigger sensor,
[01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:20.900]  what you think of is dramatic depth of field,
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:24.180]  but it's still a tiny sensor in the grand scheme of things.
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:26.420]  When you hear sensor shift, you're like,
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:28.180]  oh, I'll be able to just like shake my hand.
[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:30.460]  And it's like, yeah, maybe, but it's still the same.
[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:31.860]  What really comes down to,
[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:34.580]  and I think this is where every camera company
[01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:36.220]  is guilty of this, not just Apple,
[01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:38.140]  when they say it captures more light,
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:40.780]  that actually means something.
[01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:45.780]  And what it means is it either has an enormous top end ISO
[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:50.700]  and like DSLRs are cruising their way to 200,000 ISO,
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:54.620]  or it means at any given ISO, you get way less noise.
[01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:55.940]  So the ISO is more usable.
[01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:58.060]  You can't put that in an ad.
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:00.660]  I think even Apple would not, maybe Phil Schiller
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:02.220]  would have done that in a keynote
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.420]  because he was such a camera nerd, you know,
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:05.260]  but they're not gonna do that,
[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:06.620]  especially with these, the infomercials
[01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:07.740]  that every company is making now,
[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:11.500]  they're not gonna do like 30 second infomercial and ISO,
[01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:12.700]  but it's really what it means.
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:14.700]  It means that at any given ISO,
[01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:16.660]  it captures more light and less noise.
[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:19.700]  But then on top of it, there's Smart HDR 3.
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:23.300]  And I was talking with Seb from Halide and he was like,
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:24.940]  they're still running Smart HDR 3
[01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:27.460]  as though they're getting 12 Pro photos.
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:30.500]  So the RAWs have less noise, but the final product,
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.500]  they're still running the noise reduction
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:35.180]  in Smart HDR 3 kind of as aggressively.
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:37.580]  And I think that that's like,
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:39.680]  you have two camera systems that are different.
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:40.880]  You're running your software the same
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:44.020]  and you're generating, it's arriving at the same result
[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:45.300]  because it's not so much different.
[01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:47.500]  And I think that's where something like Pro RAW,
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.060]  this new format they're gonna ship
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:51.060]  will let us really see the differences.
[01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:53.160]  Yeah.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:56.220]  And I know that, I worry that for some people
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:57.780]  who aren't photo nerds,
[01:09:57.780 --> 01:09:59.880]  their eyes start rolling back in their head
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:03.460]  when they start hearing aperture and exposure times.
[01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:04.900]  But it really is kind of simple.
[01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.740]  And when you think back to the film era,
[01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:09.520]  it really could see it.
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:12.580]  So the aperture is just the iris in front of the lens.
[01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:15.580]  And when it's open more, it lets in more light.
[01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:19.640]  And when it's a smaller circle, it lets in less light.
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:22.220]  And that changes everything else.
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:26.360]  The exposure time is how long are you taking
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:27.720]  the exposure for, right?
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:32.080]  Like is it 1 64th of a second or 1 200th of a second
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:35.520]  or like a really slow one, like a half a second.
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:38.060]  Just let light hit the piece of film
[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:42.060]  or now it's a sensor, a digital sensor for a half second.
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:45.280]  And obviously try to hold the camera as still as you can
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:46.820]  while that's happening.
[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:48.820]  Getting that exposure time shorter
[01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:51.280]  for a subject who is in motion,
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:55.080]  like a toddler or a dog or something like that,
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.440]  really has a large practical advantage.
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:59.840]  Like I took a lot of photos from people's mouths.
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:04.540]  It's very true.
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.820]  What I saw as somebody who understands
[01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:13.240]  the way that those things interplay
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:15.320]  and I am a sort of a photo nerd.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.220]  I was looking for things,
[01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:20.560]  and you mentioned it in your review,
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:22.620]  like depth of field, like can you see,
[01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:25.020]  like without going into portrait mode where it's fake,
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:29.240]  do you get more of a bokeh effect just from this?
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:31.360]  And I was like, I'm not seeing it.
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:33.900]  But it's really not like a photo nerd thing.
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:36.560]  It really is a very practical,
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:39.200]  I'm just a person with a three-year-old
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.440]  and I pick up my phone
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.800]  when they're doing something funny or cute,
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.720]  point it at them, frame it and tap the button.
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:48.360]  And if you get a better result
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:51.480]  because it is a much shorter exposure
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:55.520]  and therefore captures the subject in motion without blur,
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.840]  that's a practical reason to prefer the camera.
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.680]  And you're getting better.
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:01.280]  It really could be the difference
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:03.880]  between a keeper and a, ah, that's no good at the blur.
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:06.860]  Yeah, and again, I come back to just how hard it is
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:07.700]  to do these reviews,
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:10.400]  especially on mobile devices during the pandemic.
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:14.400]  Before, every other year I come on and I'm like,
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.840]  we're both exhausted and iPhone season is complete
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:20.800]  and I always, I think, say to you something like,
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:24.240]  it's so much fun to work with my entire team for this week.
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:27.080]  Right, right, it's still true.
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:30.960]  I mean, we have an amazing video team and copy editors
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:34.280]  and designers who work on these reviews and it's great.
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.740]  We did it as best we could remote.
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:38.160]  But the thing that I missed the most
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.180]  was having the video team with me.
[01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:43.300]  And then for the past several years,
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:45.320]  our video producer, Maria and I,
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:47.280]  have just had photo shoots around New York City.
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:50.160]  We just constructed things we wanted to test,
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.200]  lighting situations we wanted to test.
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.040]  And I would be like,
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:55.400]  Maria, go stand in front of this backlit window
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.080]  and we're gonna see how all these phones do.
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:59.120]  And I could not do that.
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:01.980]  And I think like most reviewers,
[01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:05.120]  I don't wanna put my kid in every review 50 times.
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.960]  Like there's, for a million reasons,
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.000]  you don't wanna do that.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.320]  So in the end, I was like, well,
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:11.180]  I guess these stuffed animals
[01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:12.840]  are gonna be the iPhone review this year.
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.860]  I have no better choices.
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:15.960]  And they don't move.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:19.600]  So I could, it'd be great if this stuffed animal
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.340]  would start moving, but it's not gonna do that for me.
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:25.560]  And I think it was hard to communicate that value
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:28.100]  this time around because of the conditions
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:29.920]  in which we were reviewing it.
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:31.780]  And I think because it was hard to set that up
[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:33.560]  and see it every time,
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:36.280]  it was even then harder to communicate it to everyone.
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:38.380]  Because you can write a thousand words
[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:39.800]  about how a camera works.
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.680]  People just wanna see the photos.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:44.160]  And in particularly what they look for in photos,
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:46.120]  we've learned this after years of this,
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:47.960]  they look for which photo is brighter.
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.720]  That's the one I always think is better.
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:51.320]  And then if you punch in and show them
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.800]  that one has more detail, they say,
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.400]  no one zooms in on a photo.
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:57.120]  So like, you have to like do some work
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.000]  to convince people that this stuff matters.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.080]  And we were just limited with what I was generating
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:03.280]  to even show people.
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:07.240]  I love this, I'm gonna quote from your review,
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.760]  but I can't shake the feeling
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:12.840]  that the iPhone 12 Pro Max very much feels
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:15.520]  like the perfect phone for the life I led
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:17.080]  before the pandemic.
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:18.640]  I used to spend a lot of time commuting
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.360]  and on airplanes and otherwise out and about
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.280]  getting work done on my phone.
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.080]  I used to go to a lot of events at night
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.520]  and take a lot of photos in bars.
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.680]  My notes indicate that I used to care a lot
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:30.380]  about mobile network speeds.
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:34.340]  This phone would have made significant improvements
[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:35.180]  to all those things.
[01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:37.360]  But right now it just feels like another screen
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:39.780]  for social media on the couch.
[01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:43.260]  And I could not help but feel the same way.
[01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:48.260]  And I also wonder if my very positive feelings
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:52.720]  and reviews for the 12 mini were biased by that.
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:56.020]  Because to parlay this into a discussion
[01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:59.920]  of the opposite iPhone 12, the mini,
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.840]  clearly battery life is the single biggest hit
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:04.480]  because it has a smaller battery.
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:09.160]  And Apple's quoted numbers are all some percentage,
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:13.700]  15 to 17% lower than the regular iPhone 12.
[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:16.840]  And I'm using it, and I'm using the hell out of it
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:19.920]  during the election week, election night week.
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:24.600]  I was on my 12 mini nonstop surfing news
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:27.860]  and updates and vote counts and all this stuff.
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:29.760]  And it's like yeah, the battery went down
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:32.100]  and I could kinda see, just without even using
[01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:33.800]  a stopwatch or taking notes, I was like yeah,
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:35.480]  I'm not getting the battery life out of this
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:37.480]  that I would get on the bigger ones.
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:39.820]  But I was still in my living room
[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:42.800]  and not far from oh, I could just plug this in
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.700]  while I go to the bathroom and then come out
[01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:47.360]  and it's got 10% more battery again.
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:52.360]  And the things that would most stress a iPhone
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:58.200]  with limited battery life are irrelevant
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:00.240]  when you're at home.
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:04.800]  And the times when I would most want the extra reach
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:09.360]  of a 2.5x telephoto lens or the better camera,
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:12.600]  just ultimate best camera system you can get
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:15.060]  in an iPhone from the 12 Pro Max,
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:16.940]  well, I'm not leaving the house.
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:20.420]  How many pictures of my wife and son during pandemic
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:23.400]  are they gonna even let me take, right?
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.560]  This is just another place where I think having a toddler
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.200]  dramatically changed my feeling with the camera
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:30.420]  because I'm like, we take 400 photos of her a day
[01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:33.680]  and until she tells us to stop, we're not gonna stop.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:36.160]  That's funny, I have all these battery packs
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.320]  from when I did travel all the time,
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:39.720]  all these USB batteries, and now I just leave them.
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:42.120]  They're just scattered on the couch all the time
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:44.640]  because I'm just always sort of charging the phone again.
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:47.120]  And so my phones are all, at home,
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.240]  they're more charged than ever before.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.500]  I really think that that line about mobile network speeds,
[01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:55.520]  it's obviously a dig at 5G.
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:59.440]  That's the one thing where every reviewer
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:02.320]  unanimously was like, don't care about this.
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.320]  Like stop, everyone stop caring about this.
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.400]  Like, first of all, you shouldn't be leaving the house.
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:09.200]  Second of all, even if you do, it's not gonna be great.
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:12.500]  Third of all, when it is great on millimeter wave,
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.360]  you take a huge hit to your battery.
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:18.160]  I think that would have played out on the mini reviews
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:22.660]  very, very differently because when you're not on wifi,
[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:24.880]  that battery necessarily dies faster
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.400]  with every cell network.
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:30.920]  And chasing ultra wide band on the mini
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:32.600]  because it is one of the only small phones
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:34.560]  that has that radio, has that capability,
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:37.040]  I think the only small phone that has capability,
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:41.080]  we would have seen, oh, this battery cannot support
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:44.040]  this technology in a way that you'd wanna use it every day.
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:45.880]  But.
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:46.720]  Right.
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:48.120]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:50.040]  Keep my 12 Pro when I was using ultra wide band,
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:53.040]  I was like, oh, I'm ripping through this battery right now.
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:54.920]  Like.
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:59.920]  I've gotten, I mean, I got over 2,000 gigabytes,
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.080]  gigabits per second, I don't know what they have,
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:05.940]  whatever the measurement is in speed test.
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:09.440]  But, and which is amazing, it's absolutely amazing
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:13.340]  to get two gigabit wireless networking, period.
[01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:16.880]  It's impressive to get two gigabit networking
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:19.320]  with a cable, right, and it's like you're doing it
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:23.740]  on a phone outdoors, but practically speaking,
[01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:27.400]  my use case for it was getting an impressive number
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:28.960]  in speed test.
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:32.000]  I mean, what was I doing, you know?
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.640]  Yeah, I thought Joanna's review where she sat
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.040]  in the middle of MetLife Stadium was like one
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:37.560]  of her most inspired video reviews.
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.860]  But yeah, I think when you talk about the mini,
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:43.560]  yeah, it feels like the perfect phone for this moment
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:45.920]  because people have wanted a small phone forever.
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:47.640]  And so they, you know, Apple's the master
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.180]  of just slowly creating demand,
[01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:51.160]  then delivering you the perfect product.
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:56.160]  And then you're not stressing it as much as you would
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:59.520]  if you were taking it out into the world and commuting.
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:02.000]  And maybe you don't even know that you're standing
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.600]  on the right street corner in Manhattan
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.220]  and the ultra wide band is kicked on
[01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:06.580]  and now it's using more battery, right?
[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:09.280]  Like that is the nature of ultra wide band at this moment.
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.440]  You might, just from corner to corner
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:14.080]  as you're walking around, that modem's turning on and off.
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:16.880]  And so we, no one has really had that experience yet.
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:20.240]  And so I think there's just a lot of questions
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:24.000]  about that phone in sort of the before time
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.200]  and hopefully, you know, soon into next year
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:28.680]  as this vaccine rolls out into what the next iteration
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:29.520]  of the world looks like.
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:31.720]  But at this moment, yeah, if what you want
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:35.360]  is a great second screen for the NFL to read Twitter on,
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.800]  like the mini seems perfect.
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:39.960]  Whereas, like I said, every time I pick up the Pro Max,
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:41.680]  I'm like, man, this thing is big.
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:44.140]  I can't get used to it.
[01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:45.240]  I mean, I don't want to.
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:46.960]  But the other thing that you mentioned
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:49.220]  and I have very strong feelings about it,
[01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:51.960]  especially now that I've spent time with all four phones
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:55.860]  and they've all settled in, is the flattening of the sides.
[01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:58.880]  And I think it's really weird
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:02.000]  because I think definitely it looks cooler.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.120]  And every, you know, this leaked out of the rumor mill
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:08.160]  a year in advance and so we were all sort of expecting it.
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.600]  But I feel like everybody started expecting it
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:14.240]  when the iPad Pros went to this flat side look
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:18.920]  that's sort of a calling back to the iPhone 4S and 5 era
[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:21.040]  because when the iPads came out, it was like,
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:22.440]  well, why don't the phones have this?
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:23.640]  This feels great.
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:25.320]  I like this.
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:28.360]  I think now that we have it, it's weird
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:31.600]  because I think it's amazing with the mini, right?
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:33.720]  It really makes the mini feel great.
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:37.500]  I think the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro, it's okay with.
[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:40.880]  Although I feel like the difference between aluminum
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:45.880]  and stainless steel in hand makes,
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:48.300]  I just prefer, if I just close my eyes
[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:50.480]  and pick up these two phones that are the same size,
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:52.880]  the 12 Pro and the 12,
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:57.440]  the aluminum 12 just feels so much nicer to me.
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:59.420]  I mean, you could, you know, it's not shiny
[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:01.220]  so maybe you don't like the way it looks as much
[01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:03.760]  but it just has a nicer feel.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:07.120]  It's like the flat sides and the flat buttons
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:09.320]  just feel sharp on the stainless steel
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:12.000]  in a way that's not pleasant to me.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.860]  But then with the 12 Pro Max, it's like the flat sides,
[01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:16.680]  they just make it feel huge.
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:21.680]  I don't know why, I feel like it's the oddest thing
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:26.800]  and my wife had the 11 Pro Max from last year
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:29.800]  and it's not that much bigger of a device
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:33.360]  and it is kind of taller in the way that it is bigger
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:36.440]  but it somehow feels so much bigger
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:38.040]  because of the flat sides.
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:39.240]  I don't get it.
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:42.840]  It's like rounded corners make things nicer to hold.
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:46.320]  So I disagree with you on the 12 Pro.
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:49.560]  I have the blue one, Pacific Blue,
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.520]  is what I call it this year.
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:53.120]  I think that is like one of the most beautiful products
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:53.960]  Apple has ever made.
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:57.000]  The stainless steel Pacific Blue iPhone 12 Pro.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.880]  It is, like I pulled it out of the box
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:02.680]  and I slacked to the team, like this thing is amazing.
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:04.040]  And then everyone was like, calm down.
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:06.920]  Like I was like gushing over it.
[01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:08.280]  I know Dieter disagrees with me,
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:11.800]  he thinks the matte aluminum regular 12 Pro is better.
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:13.140]  Great, personal opinion.
[01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:15.060]  The joke in my 12 Pro review were like,
[01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:16.360]  some of you are gonna spend $200
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:19.520]  cause this is the shiny one and like, I'm with you.
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:21.640]  Like that's who I am too.
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:24.100]  The mini, right, it's dense.
[01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:26.800]  I think the flat sides make it feel dense
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:28.520]  and premium in a good way.
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:32.400]  And then I have a gold 12 Pro Max.
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:34.360]  So it's a white back with the gold sides.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:39.360]  And I just think it looks, it's like too big.
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:40.920]  I keep, it's what I keep saying,
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:45.120]  but the flat sides just, they make it imposing
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:47.940]  in a way that my 11 Pro Max, right.
[01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:51.000]  You know, it was, in many ways the 11 Pro Max
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.960]  basic shape is the same as the 8 Pro
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:55.920]  or the 6 Plus or whatever, right?
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:59.520]  Like here's a round rack with rounded sides,
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.200]  it's just screening up bigger.
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:03.440]  And that shape worked, it's a little surfboard-y,
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:05.420]  but it was nice to hold.
[01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:08.720]  And I think the 12 Pro Max is not nice to hold.
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:11.680]  Like I would never want to put the 12 Pro in a case.
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:12.680]  I think it's just beautiful.
[01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:14.380]  And I was sad when I put it into its case.
[01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:16.460]  And the Apple Clear case this year especially
[01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:19.540]  is like horrible with that circle on the back.
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:20.380]  Like what are they doing?
[01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:22.880]  I don't, I don't get it.
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:23.720]  I really don't.
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:27.040]  I feel like, and I've shown it to other people
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:28.580]  and they're like, ah, no, it's all right.
[01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:29.420]  I don't care.
[01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:30.800]  And I'm like, well, no, wait,
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.640]  why is there a weird circle in the back?
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:33.480]  I get it.
[01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:37.440]  I kind of feel like the backstory on that
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:39.880]  is that Apple had this team,
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:41.840]  we should make a clear case, right?
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:46.440]  I think Apple's case business is a weird subsection of Apple
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.200]  because it seems to me anecdotally
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:51.880]  that most iPhone users, everybody knows famously,
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:56.320]  at least 95% of iPhone users use a case of some sort.
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:59.900]  It also seems to me though that of that 95% of people
[01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:04.900]  who use a case, 90% of them use a third-party case,
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:07.280]  whether it's because they're cheaper
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:10.560]  or whether it's just to each their own
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:12.520]  and it's a way to personalize it.
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.360]  You meet 1,000 people,
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:17.440]  you might see 1,000 different cases, right?
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:20.100]  It's very personal thing.
[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:23.600]  But Apple still is very committed to it
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.240]  and I think they sell enough of them
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:26.720]  and they're expensive.
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:29.840]  They're like 50 bucks for the,
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.840]  aren't the rubber ones like 50 bucks?
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:35.280]  And like the leather ones are, I don't know what they are.
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:36.760]  More expensive.
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:38.040]  But they're, yeah.
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:38.880]  Something like that.
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:39.700]  We did a story, Ashley Carmen at the Bridge,
[01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:42.360]  the story a long time ago on the woman
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:45.600]  who is in charge of case designs every year
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:46.720]  at the Verizon store.
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:48.920]  So it's like a huge business for Verizon.
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:51.440]  It's their single easiest upsell with every phone.
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:54.880]  And so they try to get exclusive cases.
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.820]  They think about case design trends.
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:24:59.800]  It's like they're running a fashion business
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:01.480]  next to their phone business
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:03.200]  and there's obviously a person in charge of it.
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:05.140]  And that story, it was one of those stories
[01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:07.200]  where she went and got it and came back
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:10.440]  and I was like, oh, like I never even thought of that.
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:11.920]  I'll send you a link, we can put it in there.
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:13.300]  But it's a huge business.
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:15.160]  It's free money, right?
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.560]  These cases cost cents to make
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.240]  and then they sell them for huge numbers.
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:21.920]  And they were like, we're so proud of Meg.
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:24.120]  See if we're putting a circle on the back of the clear one.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:26.240]  Like, I don't know.
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:28.480]  What I was getting at is I feel sad
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:31.360]  about putting the two smaller ones in a case
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.520]  and the Pro Max has to be in a case
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:35.160]  just to make it easier to hold.
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:37.800]  And that is the sign that it's like veering
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:38.960]  on the edge of too big.
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:41.680]  It's already too big.
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:44.440]  Yeah, see, where I think that the case thing is like,
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:47.680]  and Apple does good work with leather and the silicon.
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:50.140]  To me, their silicon cases for 50 bucks
[01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:52.240]  don't last long enough that everybody I know
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:56.160]  who uses the Apple silicone ones, the corners rub away.
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:59.160]  But in general, Apple's good with materials.
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:01.780]  But famously, I've heard from people who like clear cases.
[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:04.040]  Clear cases tend to yellow.
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.040]  You buy a third-party clear case and you love it
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:08.800]  because that's what you want, a clear case.
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:10.900]  And then three months later, it's kind of yellow.
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:12.640]  And six months later, it looks like you had it
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:16.520]  in a casino soaking up nicotine smoke.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:20.440]  And I think Apple looked at this and thought,
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:21.880]  well, people want clear cases.
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:23.160]  We're good with materials.
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:26.240]  We can make a clear case that won't turn yellow over time.
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:28.520]  And they have, from what I've seen
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:31.760]  from daring Fireball readers who like the Apple clear case,
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:33.160]  it doesn't yellow.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:36.560]  And they're like, so now we have this third type of case.
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.560]  We had the rubber ones, we had the leather ones,
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.260]  and now we have clear ones.
[01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:42.580]  And I think they were very proud of themselves for this.
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:45.960]  I think maybe they sell well by Apple's case standards.
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:47.520]  And then there's this other team
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:50.820]  making magnetic charging system.
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:53.680]  And I feel like there must have been this meeting
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:58.680]  where it's like, hmm, huh, huh.
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.960]  On the one hand, people are buying clear cases
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:02.600]  and we make a really good one.
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:05.260]  And on the other hand, if we can't really sell
[01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:09.160]  a clear case that's clear and magnetic.
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:10.800]  And so they did this thing and it's like,
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:12.840]  it's almost like there's like a Green Lantern logo.
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:14.640]  I thought it was a power button.
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:16.080]  I can't tell you what it is.
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:21.680]  I don't know, to me, I mean, it doesn't look bad
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:24.100]  and they made it centered around the Apple logo
[01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:25.800]  and it's strategically placed.
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:28.140]  And if you were going to put a circle
[01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:31.360]  and a little line coming out of it,
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:33.820]  it's as nice as it could be, but it's not clear.
[01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:35.580]  That's the thing, right?
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:38.600]  So the little line, from what I understand,
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:40.420]  so MagSafe has the magnets in a circle
[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:43.080]  and then it has the magnet underneath the circle
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:44.060]  for positioning.
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:47.560]  So you click it on and then that's the one
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:48.760]  that aligns it perfectly.
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:50.080]  So that's why you need the line.
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:54.820]  But man, have you been using your MagSafe charger at all?
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:58.560]  Yeah, I have it on my bedside.
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.880]  I have mixed feelings about it the longer I go.
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:03.240]  Like there are places where I know I want one
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:07.440]  and on my bedside probably isn't it.
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:10.920]  And it's funny because I am the person
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:13.640]  who has misplaced their phone,
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:17.380]  misaligned it on a regular Qi charger
[01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:19.080]  and then woken up in the morning
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:22.560]  and it doesn't have a charge or it's down to 20%
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.920]  because it wasn't getting a charge overnight.
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:27.520]  And MagSafe does change that,
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:30.200]  but it's like the fact that you can't just lift it off
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:33.160]  is like, it's driving me nuts.
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:35.520]  It's like I've traded one problem
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:36.840]  for an entirely different one
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:38.960]  and I don't know which problem I'm gonna solve for.
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:41.620]  So I do not have any idea why that cord is so short.
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:45.680]  Because the problem it seems like it's solving,
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:46.920]  this is very on-brand for me,
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:48.460]  the problem that it seems like it's solving
[01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:50.960]  is Apple doesn't want any ports on its phone.
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:52.480]  So how do we make it charge fast
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:54.280]  when there's no lightning port?
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:55.600]  Okay, well, what's a thing
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:57.960]  that a lot of people do every single day?
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:00.160]  They get into bed, they plug in their phone
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:02.320]  and they use their phone in bed because their battery,
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:03.520]  it's the end of the day and the battery's almost dead
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:04.920]  but they wanna charge it, they wanna keep it.
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:07.200]  So okay, we made a thing that solves our problem.
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:09.200]  Now we're gonna give it a four inch cord.
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:11.840]  What?
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:15.480]  You actually haven't solved anyone's problems
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:16.760]  in any situation.
[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:17.600]  I'm on an airplane,
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:19.880]  I plug that thing in the back of the seat rest.
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:21.480]  It won't even hit the tray table.
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:26.080]  Right, or if you're on Amtrak,
[01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:27.520]  one of the nice things about train travel
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:29.100]  is that every seat has power.
[01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:30.240]  But if you have the aisle seat,
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:33.000]  you're not close to it, it's over by the window.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.280]  And now it's like, my thing doesn't work.
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:37.000]  I have no idea why this cord is so short.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.680]  And then, like you said, there's a million places
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:42.320]  where I want this thing to exist.
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:45.100]  I desperately want a MagSafe car charger.
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:48.300]  Right, like I have a wireless charging.
[01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:49.700]  I'm a sucker for them.
[01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:52.040]  I buy every one of Instagram that I see.
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:52.880]  It's a real problem.
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:54.420]  The algorithm knows me.
[01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:55.860]  Okay, I can see it.
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:59.380]  I can envision it, how great it will be to get in my car
[01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:01.820]  and like clip the thing in and walk away.
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:03.300]  It doesn't exist.
[01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:06.020]  And it's just such a huge miss to me
[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:09.660]  that Apple invented this accessory ecosystem
[01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:13.260]  where their own accessories seem a little confused
[01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:14.460]  about what they're for.
[01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:17.160]  And then third parties are not ready for this holiday season
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:20.760]  with the most obvious accessories.
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:21.860]  And I just, I kind of don't,
[01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:25.180]  there's knockoff mounts on Amazon.
[01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:26.300]  And I'm like, how bad could it be?
[01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:27.140]  It's just a magnet.
[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:30.220]  But I'm not quite ready to take that leap.
[01:30:30.220 --> 01:30:31.580]  But I'm just like,
[01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:34.940]  I think Apple's like connector ecosystem ideas
[01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:36.820]  have never really taken off the way
[01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:40.360]  that any rational person would have expected them to.
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:45.000]  So like to this day, there isn't some enormous ecosystem
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.680]  of lightning accessories.
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:50.040]  USB-C, I think we could do another whole two hour episode
[01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:52.800]  on what on earth has happened with USB-C.
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:54.660]  The smart connector on the iPad.
[01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:57.760]  There are virtually no keyboards
[01:30:57.760 --> 01:30:59.260]  that use the smart connector for the iPad,
[01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:02.060]  which just boggles the mind.
[01:31:02.060 --> 01:31:03.700]  Because Apple will tell you that's an open connector.
[01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:06.540]  And I think MagSafe is, it could be great,
[01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:10.920]  but history suggests it's gonna be a little confused,
[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:12.600]  at least when people figure out what it's for.
[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.840]  And the length of that cord is,
[01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:16.720]  that's the one that like,
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:19.160]  yep, that's the sign that it's a little confused.
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:21.040]  Right, and it's like,
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:23.880]  I know why sometimes you want a shorter cord.
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:27.080]  Because if you're going to use it in a scenario
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:31.140]  where you know it's within three feet of the outlet,
[01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:36.140]  then a one meter cord will reduce the need
[01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:37.500]  for cord clutter, right?
[01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:39.420]  You don't have to cinch it up or something
[01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:44.420]  or have it making weird loop-de-loops that you don't need.
[01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:47.580]  But if it's the one and only size, it's way too short.
[01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:50.020]  And I don't know,
[01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:51.720]  maybe it's because I'm not going anywhere,
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:54.720]  but it just seems to me like bedside is a primary use case.
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:57.740]  And then it's not heavy enough.
[01:31:57.740 --> 01:31:58.580]  Yeah.
[01:31:58.580 --> 01:32:02.860]  Well, yeah, well if it were heavier,
[01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:04.260]  then maybe you could lift it off.
[01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:05.480]  And it's like, I've gotten good,
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:07.180]  I've tried to explain to my wife,
[01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:08.900]  because I got her one for her phone too.
[01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:11.340]  And it's like, she's very annoyed by the fact
[01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:12.460]  that you can't just lift it off.
[01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:15.100]  And I'm like, you kind of do it like an Oreo, you know?
[01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:15.940]  Like.
[01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:20.020]  It's in the realm of doomed things
[01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:21.260]  that you have to say to your partner
[01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:22.900]  about technology you've bought them.
[01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:25.540]  How to hold it and then saying like an Oreo
[01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:27.980]  is like, it's right below,
[01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:30.080]  I changed how the remote for the TV works.
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:32.980]  Well, I'm good at getting it.
[01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:37.180]  Now, to be honest, I would be doing a disservice
[01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:38.940]  to the Newman's Own company
[01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:40.820]  if I don't mention my beloved Newmanos,
[01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:44.580]  which are a superior Oreo-style cookie.
[01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:48.440]  But I do, I enjoy a Newmano very much.
[01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:52.420]  But I also do enjoy prying the top off
[01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:53.720]  and eating it in two pieces.
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:55.340]  And I can do it with one hand.
[01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:58.460]  And the way to do it is not by just prying it apart.
[01:32:58.460 --> 01:33:00.660]  You do like a little push, you know?
[01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:03.300]  You push them apart.
[01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:05.420]  I thought I had, and it's like, this is,
[01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:07.180]  and I think I'm saying to my wife,
[01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:08.540]  like, here's your advantage.
[01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:11.100]  You know, you get to live with John Gruber
[01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:13.740]  and you get Daring Fireball-style content
[01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:15.340]  personalized for you.
[01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:18.980]  And instead, she's like, why did you buy me?
[01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:20.300]  I don't want to open an Oreo.
[01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:22.020]  I just want to pick my phone off the table.
[01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:23.940]  And I'm like, oh, well, that's a good point.
[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:26.420]  Yeah, it's like the curse of the reviewer
[01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:30.020]  is to get brutally yanked into reality
[01:33:30.020 --> 01:33:32.140]  every time you're like, do you like this?
[01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:34.580]  And my wife is always like, I'm not using an app.
[01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:36.140]  Like, that's her answer to everything.
[01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:39.220]  One of the reasons that we, you know,
[01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:43.620]  we, in the pandemic, I just keep buying smart home crap.
[01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:45.260]  It's not useful or good.
[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:47.780]  So like, all right, there's another light switch
[01:33:47.780 --> 01:33:48.900]  we can turn on with our voice.
[01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:50.060]  That makes sense.
[01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:53.420]  And I've realized that all of it has to be a home kit
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:56.380]  or, like, Becky just won't use it.
[01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:58.800]  Like, if it's not in Control Center one swipe away,
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:33:59.640]  it might as well not.
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:01.540]  Like, download this app.
[01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:03.180]  And she's like, no.
[01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:06.940]  And that's the end of that conversation.
[01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:10.300]  So the one and only smart home thing
[01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:14.180]  that I've ever done that's really been a hit in this house
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:17.220]  with people other than me is getting the Christmas tree
[01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:19.580]  lights onto a smart switch.
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:21.620]  And that's a game changer.
[01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:24.860]  Because the old way of getting Christmas tree lights,
[01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:26.420]  somebody's got to get behind the tree.
[01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:28.360]  Or you had one of those big, round, mechanical timers.
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:29.900]  That's what my dad always had, yeah.
[01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:30.620]  Yeah.
[01:34:30.620 --> 01:34:32.380]  Yeah, it's never been good.
[01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:35.020]  And now being able to tell one of your smart assistants
[01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:36.740]  to do it and have it work.
[01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:40.240]  It did take about three years for that
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:43.780]  to really lock in to where it worked all the time, which
[01:34:43.780 --> 01:34:46.620]  I think is, like, a very funny state of the tech industry
[01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:49.540]  story, that it took three years of iterative work
[01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:51.940]  from three of the smartest, most advanced companies
[01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:55.580]  in the world for turn on the lights to always work.
[01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:57.940]  Because the first year I set it up,
[01:34:57.940 --> 01:35:01.020]  like, I distinctly remember being told,
[01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:02.980]  why would I do it when it doesn't work?
[01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:04.900]  And being laughed at because I was screaming,
[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:07.300]  turn on the lights over and over again.
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:09.420]  This year, I think they've all, I've
[01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:10.860]  only tried it with Google and Siri,
[01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:12.300]  but it works every time this time.
[01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:20.140]  Well, to me, it's one of the great causes
[01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:26.060]  for the second half of my career is non-deterministic errors
[01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:27.180]  in computing, right?
[01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:29.500]  It used to be that if something went wrong
[01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:31.860]  and we would complain endlessly that, oh, look
[01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:33.380]  at this terrible error message.
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:36.480]  It gave me a negative 1438 error.
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:37.420]  Well, that's useless.
[01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:42.180]  And the complaint was error messages should be humanized.
[01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:44.660]  And instead of just reporting an error code,
[01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:46.660]  you should know what the error code is and put it
[01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:49.340]  in the human readable form, blah, blah, blah.
[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:51.980]  Well, who knew that that was the good old days?
[01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:55.060]  Because you at least had something to search for, right?
[01:35:55.060 --> 01:36:00.500]  You could search for 1438, and then maybe you'd find an answer.
[01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:03.020]  Now, when stuff, you think it's going to work,
[01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:06.020]  and you say to your device, blah, blah, blah,
[01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:09.300]  and it used to work, you know, we have a thing,
[01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:11.260]  we have shades, we have smart shades.
[01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:13.260]  And I love them because we have a lot of windows.
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:17.060]  And so we move the shades up and down a lot more than we would
[01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:19.700]  if we had to do it physically.
[01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:24.940]  But I had a thing in the Home app, open main floor shades.
[01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:26.700]  And at the end of the day, you could
[01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:28.340]  say close main floor shades.
[01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:31.580]  And it closes and opens all the shades
[01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:33.140]  on our main floor of our house.
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:34.300]  And I love it.
[01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:36.540]  And then all of a sudden, I thought
[01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:38.980]  it was because I had the HomePod Mini.
[01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:45.100]  At some point in iOS 13 or 14, at some point about six weeks
[01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:47.020]  ago, it stopped working.
[01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:50.700]  And it was like my setting, it was just,
[01:36:50.700 --> 01:36:53.540]  but it didn't say to me why it wouldn't work.
[01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:56.900]  And I changed the name of it from open main floor
[01:36:56.900 --> 01:37:00.220]  shades to just open main shades.
[01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:02.460]  And then it worked again.
[01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:04.500]  I had to take out the word floor.
[01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:07.140]  And so I guess what was happening
[01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:09.740]  was that even though I had a setting named
[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:14.500]  open main floor shades, it was before interpreted it
[01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:18.340]  as a saved setting name, it was trying to be smart about it
[01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:21.660]  and figure out, oh, he wants all the shades on the main floor
[01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:22.980]  to be open.
[01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:25.220]  And it's like, no, no, you don't have to be smart.
[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:29.140]  I already made a thing with this name, just do it.
[01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:31.260]  But it wouldn't tell me why it stopped working.
[01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:33.260]  That was the thing that drove me nuts.
[01:37:33.260 --> 01:37:35.820]  The fact that it stopped working was bad enough.
[01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:38.780]  But it was the fact that it wasn't like,
[01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:40.300]  this isn't working because you have
[01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:42.100]  a conflict with a named thing.
[01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:43.540]  That would have told me everything.
[01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:47.020]  I had to backwards engineer it.
[01:37:47.020 --> 01:37:49.860]  And then I tried renaming it last week back to where it was.
[01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:53.260]  My favorite general HomeKit troubleshooting,
[01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:55.340]  and this is exactly what you're talking about,
[01:37:55.340 --> 01:37:58.500]  is oftentimes the answer to a HomeKit automation
[01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:00.140]  going sideways.
[01:38:00.140 --> 01:38:02.660]  The best answer is to restart your Apple TV.
[01:38:05.660 --> 01:38:08.220]  Right, and so none of that makes sense,
[01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:12.460]  unless you are aware of the fact that the automations are
[01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:14.820]  running in a local process on your Apple TV, which
[01:38:14.820 --> 01:38:18.660]  is your hub and is controlling this entire system,
[01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:20.460]  but it's completely invisible to you.
[01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:22.820]  And it never tells you that this is the problem.
[01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:24.940]  It's just suddenly when you open the garage door,
[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:26.500]  the light doesn't come on anymore.
[01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:31.340]  And the answer, bizarrely, is to restart your TV.
[01:38:31.340 --> 01:38:33.900]  And it's like, all of that should
[01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:37.860]  be a lot more direct, or at least communicated to you
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:40.260]  that, hey, this thing under your TV is a computer.
[01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:41.700]  It's actually the server.
[01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:46.020]  It's the master server control server for your home.
[01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:47.300]  And right now it's confused.
[01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:49.100]  And can you please stop watching Netflix
[01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:52.780]  so that the garage door works again?
[01:38:52.780 --> 01:38:55.100]  I think that's a much better.
[01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:58.140]  The three-year process to turn on the Christmas lights working
[01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:01.820]  better is every company and every device maker
[01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:05.060]  realizing that sending a light switch command to a cloud
[01:39:05.060 --> 01:39:08.500]  to talk to another cloud, everyone knows that's bad.
[01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.740]  So all of it has moved local.
[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:13.460]  All three of the major home platforms
[01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:15.500]  are now way more local in that way.
[01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:17.860]  But that means that there are now computers in your house
[01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:19.900]  that are like, they're computers.
[01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:20.700]  They're brittle.
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:22.940]  They're brittle in exactly the ways you would expect.
[01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:25.180]  And sometimes you just have to restart the Apple TV
[01:39:25.180 --> 01:39:26.460]  to make the lights work again.
[01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:30.060]  And it's like, well, some problems are eternal.
[01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:31.700]  This computer got confused, and we're just
[01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:34.580]  going to unplug it and plug it back in.
[01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:36.220]  It's one of those things where I just
[01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:39.140]  love sometimes is endlessly fascinating to me
[01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:43.220]  to think about what would I love to tell myself 25 years ago
[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:49.980]  if I had an hour to just explain 2020's technology to my night.
[01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:53.100]  But if you imagine going back to somebody in the mid-'90s
[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:56.020]  and explaining to them that if you explained that you could
[01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:59.020]  have a very powerful Unix computer running
[01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:01.380]  in your pocket at all times with a touchscreen interface,
[01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:03.180]  you'd be like, oh, my god, that's amazing.
[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:04.380]  I can't wait.
[01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:05.540]  That sounds great, right?
[01:40:05.540 --> 01:40:07.740]  That sounds like that's where the future should be.
[01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:09.140]  If you explain to them that you'll
[01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:12.620]  be issuing commands over a network in your home,
[01:40:12.620 --> 01:40:14.660]  and they're going to leave your home
[01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:16.660]  and go to a data center somewhere.
[01:40:16.660 --> 01:40:20.100]  And you don't know where, but it probably
[01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:22.020]  could be across the continent.
[01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:26.420]  And then that's where the command will be parsed
[01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:29.580]  and will do some computing.
[01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:32.380]  And then they'll send a signal back to your home,
[01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:34.780]  and then it'll do the thing that you said to do,
[01:40:34.780 --> 01:40:38.140]  which is directing a command at a light bulb that
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:40.300]  is three feet away from you.
[01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:42.380]  And you'd say, no, you're making that up.
[01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:43.820]  Yeah.
[01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:45.340]  You'd be like, that makes no sense.
[01:40:45.340 --> 01:40:47.180]  Why wouldn't you just send the command right to the light
[01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:48.660]  bulb?
[01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:51.060]  25 years ago, you would say, that makes no sense at all.
[01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:52.260]  Yeah, and somewhere in that chain.
[01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:53.540]  And you'd say, no, that's that.
[01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:56.060]  And somewhere in that chain, any one of these companies
[01:40:56.060 --> 01:40:58.060]  might send you a recording of your voice to a person
[01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:00.740]  and make sure they got it right.
[01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:04.020]  Right, like, OK, that's like, now I'm
[01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:05.540]  like turning the knob to see when
[01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:08.540]  you're going to stop believing me that I'm telling the truth.
[01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:10.020]  All right, let me take a break here
[01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:11.180]  and thank our third and final sponsor,
[01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:12.820]  our good friends at Squarespace.
[01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:13.940]  Look, I'll make this short.
[01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:15.700]  You guys, I talk about Squarespace all the time.
[01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:16.300]  They keep coming.
[01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:17.060]  They keep coming back.
[01:41:17.060 --> 01:41:17.980]  They sponsor the show.
[01:41:17.980 --> 01:41:21.020]  They're one of the longest running sponsors of this show.
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:22.020]  Here's the story.
[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:22.940]  It's simple.
[01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:27.500]  If you need a new website or if someone you know
[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:30.460]  needs a new website, whether it's for a new project
[01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:33.300]  or to take an old website that is way out of date
[01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:35.860]  and doesn't have any of the features that you want
[01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:39.380]  and update it to something new with all the features you want,
[01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:43.500]  like a great new design or an integrated blog or a way
[01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:46.180]  to host a podcast right there on the site or a way
[01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:50.060]  to host a store and sell stuff right there with everything
[01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:52.740]  you need, like taking credit cards and processing
[01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:55.940]  and stuff like that, go to Squarespace.
[01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:58.780]  Go to squarespace.com and get started.
[01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:00.620]  You get a 30-day free trial.
[01:42:00.620 --> 01:42:01.340]  You can build it.
[01:42:01.340 --> 01:42:02.420]  It's all real.
[01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:05.060]  During the free trial, it's not like it's got like a Squarespace
[01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:06.900]  watermark on it or something like that.
[01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:08.740]  It looks totally real.
[01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:10.900]  You can be up and running very soon,
[01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:12.620]  I mean, just like an hour or two.
[01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:15.940]  You could have something totally credible, very real,
[01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:18.780]  ready to go, start using it.
[01:42:18.780 --> 01:42:21.940]  And then when the free trial's over, you just sign up
[01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:25.220]  and you remember to go to squarespace.com slash talk show,
[01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:28.180]  squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:31.740]  And when you sign up and use that same code talk show
[01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:34.020]  and you get 10% off your first purchase.
[01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:35.660]  So whether it's you or someone you know
[01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:39.180]  who's come to you for help, send them to Squarespace.
[01:42:39.180 --> 01:42:42.660]  It's the best way to get a new website up and running.
[01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:44.700]  All right, let's do recommendations.
[01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:46.180]  This is what people want to know from me,
[01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:48.140]  and I feel like I haven't given them an answer yet.
[01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:50.540]  And this podcast is where I'm going to.
[01:42:50.540 --> 01:42:53.580]  What iPhones would you buy right now
[01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:56.540]  if you had to buy an iPhone 12 to use for the next year?
[01:42:56.540 --> 01:42:58.060]  I would buy the Pro Max.
[01:42:58.060 --> 01:43:01.300]  And solely, my hesitation with the size aside,
[01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:02.940]  solely because I do have a toddler
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:04.940]  and we take a million photos of her.
[01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:09.060]  Right, and I don't want to get too caught up
[01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:11.140]  in the current next, let's say,
[01:43:11.140 --> 01:43:14.580]  three, four months of pandemic winter.
[01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:18.900]  It's very, very good chance that at some point in 2021,
[01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:22.780]  we're gonna go places again and take pictures.
[01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:24.540]  I think for me, I'm not saying
[01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:25.660]  I would recommend it to others,
[01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:27.860]  but for me personally, I am on the cusp
[01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:31.740]  of buying myself an iPhone 12 with no adjectives.
[01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:35.460]  And just say goodbye to the third camera lens.
[01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:36.500]  I'm okay with it.
[01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:39.540]  Well, you're like a real camera person, right?
[01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:41.100]  You have like an echo?
[01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:42.500]  Well, I used to.
[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:44.780]  I haven't bought it, that's the thing.
[01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:46.980]  And that's part of my thinking is,
[01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:48.900]  part of my thinking is, you know what?
[01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:52.100]  I should stop pretending that my iPhone is my only camera.
[01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:57.300]  And this is what I'm thinking is that at some point,
[01:43:57.300 --> 01:43:59.060]  but I'm gonna wait because why not wait?
[01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:00.060]  I'm not going anywhere.
[01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:01.900]  But as soon as it seems like I'm on the cusp
[01:44:01.900 --> 01:44:05.540]  of quarantine is over, we can start traveling again.
[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:09.820]  I'm getting myself a nice new camera, a camera camera.
[01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:12.260]  Because I should, I haven't bought one in a couple years.
[01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:16.020]  I think the last one I bought was my Fuji X100S.
[01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:19.180]  And the X100S is, I don't know, five, six years old.
[01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:21.460]  I haven't bought a camera in like five years.
[01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:23.580]  So I feel like I'm in for a nice surprise
[01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:26.940]  having waited so long between buying camera cameras.
[01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:30.860]  And I'm just gonna stop pretending
[01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:34.140]  that the quote unquote telephoto lens on an iPhone
[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:36.140]  is actually all that good of a camera.
[01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:37.500]  Yeah, by the way, on the Pro Max,
[01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:40.100]  it is like especially not that good of a camera.
[01:44:40.100 --> 01:44:43.940]  Yeah, and that is, I'm glad you brought that up
[01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:46.380]  because that was one of the head scratchers to me.
[01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:49.780]  It's like, okay, now it's a 2.5X instead of 2.0.
[01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:51.020]  And that sounds better
[01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:53.720]  because you're getting more reach, right?
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:57.960]  So, but it's also a little slower
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:00.800]  and it's like, isn't that gonna be noisier?
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:02.540]  And then your photos in particular,
[01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:04.040]  I think that was the one where you took a picture
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:07.960]  of a pickup truck and it was like, yeah, it's noisy.
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:11.540]  Yeah, and that's just like me standing on my upstairs deck
[01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:12.640]  shooting down in the driveway.
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:15.920]  Like if you were doing what people want to do
[01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:18.500]  with telephotos, which I'm always told
[01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:20.460]  is why the telephotos sell well,
[01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:22.300]  you're shooting your kids play.
[01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:24.340]  That seems to be the thing.
[01:45:24.340 --> 01:45:25.800]  Like you're gonna be so disappointed
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:27.520]  by having a slower lens.
[01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:29.800]  And then same app as you're talking about,
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:30.960]  longer exposure times.
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:33.760]  So definitely in a kid's play, people are moving around.
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:36.860]  So it just seems like the weirdest trade off to me.
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:40.160]  I don't, I would say I think portrait mode
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:42.640]  is better on these phones, but I always use the 1X lens.
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:44.680]  All this little stuff where it's,
[01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:46.320]  yeah, the camera's better, but you know what?
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:48.780]  Like I have a Sony RX100, it's great.
[01:45:48.780 --> 01:45:51.080]  Every photo I ever take with that camera
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:53.040]  and like do the slightest amount of work
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:54.600]  in Lightroom and put it in Instagram,
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:56.720]  people ask me what camera I use.
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:59.120]  And it's like, oh, it's this very accessible camera
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:02.020]  for anyone, not to mention the collection
[01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:05.640]  of now ancient Nikon DSLRs that float around this house.
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:07.760]  Like when I actually use one of those,
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:09.520]  people like, people love this.
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:11.400]  My parents love those photos.
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:12.640]  Not that I think anybody should carry around
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:16.080]  a gigantic Nikon DSLR all the time, but it's great.
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:17.240]  But I'm saying the 12 Pro Max
[01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:19.040]  because we're always in a situation
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:20.120]  where we want to take a photo quickly
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:22.120]  and I value those photos being really good
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:25.000]  because they, we're gonna look at them forever.
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.520]  But just walking around, like I actually get,
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:31.040]  I get more value out of, I took a photo with a camera,
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:33.220]  I came back and made it look the way I want.
[01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:35.900]  Yeah, so I'm just not worried
[01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:37.160]  about that missing third lens.
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:39.480]  I will miss it, I'm not saying I haven't used it.
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:41.640]  And I did the thing where you can go
[01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:43.920]  into the Photos app on the Mac and say,
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:48.300]  set up a smart album with any, meets any of these criteria
[01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:52.800]  and the lens matches, you know, six millimeters
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:55.140]  is I think the size of the actual size
[01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:58.280]  of the telephoto lens on the iPhone 11
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:00.440]  and 11 Pro, et cetera.
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:02.880]  And yeah, I've taken a bunch of photos
[01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:05.720]  that I use that lens and it's like,
[01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:08.880]  yeah, I guess if I shot it with the regular 1X lens
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:12.520]  and just cropped, it wouldn't be quite as nice.
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:15.720]  But there were like almost none of those photos
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:17.580]  where I was like, oh, it would break my heart
[01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:19.260]  if I couldn't have gotten this.
[01:47:19.260 --> 01:47:22.280]  Whereas the ultrawide is like the least good camera
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:23.800]  and I'm always like, these are the funnest pictures
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:24.680]  I've taken.
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:27.520]  And it's, you can't fake it, right?
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:31.280]  So if you take a 1X lens and just crop to the center
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:35.460]  and you go from like a six megapixel image to a,
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:38.280]  or a 12 megapixel image to a six millimeter
[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:42.580]  or megapixel crop of the center and zoom it up,
[01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:44.380]  it'll look fine on the phone.
[01:47:44.380 --> 01:47:47.140]  It's not gonna look big, good on a big screen.
[01:47:47.140 --> 01:47:50.580]  It's not gonna look good if you print it real big.
[01:47:50.580 --> 01:47:52.800]  But like you said, nobody's,
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:54.660]  apparently nobody zooms in anymore.
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:47:59.400]  But there's no way to fake that extra,
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:03.720]  that 0.5X ultrawide form factor.
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:04.660]  It really isn't.
[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:07.360]  And back in the days when we would be able
[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:10.240]  to go places indoors and see people,
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:11.440]  it's like, it's amazing.
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:13.320]  It's kind of fun how you can get like,
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:15.280]  oh, you can get the whole table in the shot.
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:17.640]  Yeah, yeah, and there's also,
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:21.440]  no one is buying those lenses for their real cameras, right?
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:24.100]  Like those are, they look weird.
[01:48:24.100 --> 01:48:25.320]  Apple has done some stuff this year
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:28.620]  to correct the distortion, which is I think great.
[01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:32.960]  But no one's walking around with a fisheye lens all the time
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:34.360]  and like, that's kind of what you're getting.
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:37.520]  And I think there's a reason Apple went with the ultrawide
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:39.720]  on the, on all of the phones,
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:43.960]  because it's the one where I think people use it the most
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:45.420]  compared to the tele.
[01:48:45.420 --> 01:48:48.400]  It is just the worst camera on the phone,
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:49.840]  just like on a technical level.
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:52.340]  But I think the value of what you can make with it
[01:48:52.340 --> 01:48:54.120]  far outweighs that,
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:56.180]  whether or not it's a little grainy or whatever.
[01:48:56.180 --> 01:49:00.080]  Yeah, so you use portrait mode on the phone?
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:03.840]  So I have long been anti-portrait mode
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:05.320]  and with this phone in particular,
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:07.260]  I've started using it more.
[01:49:07.260 --> 01:49:09.300]  I'm a little anti, it's like,
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:13.080]  I feel like I feel the way about portrait mode on iPhones,
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:14.560]  the way I feel about the touch bar,
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:17.600]  where it's like, I'm known for, you know,
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:21.320]  it's like my career is having very strong opinions
[01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:22.480]  about these things.
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:26.760]  And yet somehow I'm kind of ambivalent about the touch bar.
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:27.600]  I really am.
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:29.000]  And now that I've been using it,
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.360]  I've been really, really poking at it
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:35.040]  the last couple of weeks using this M1 MacBook Pro.
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:37.680]  And I'm like, eh, I still feel meh.
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:39.240]  It's like, eh, I don't hate it.
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:40.760]  I've come to actively dislike it.
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:42.340]  I know, and I read your review,
[01:49:42.340 --> 01:49:45.120]  and I know you did, and I can see why some people do.
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:49.240]  I really feel like, for me personally,
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:53.400]  they solved all of my dislike of it
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:56.460]  by just moving it away from the delete key a little bit
[01:49:56.460 --> 01:49:58.320]  and adding a physical escape key.
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:49:59.640]  And it's like, yeah, all right.
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:01.400]  Now it's like, I don't hate it.
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:03.360]  I wish it had haptics.
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:05.940]  I wish that, I feel like they could,
[01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:09.720]  I feel like for something that they know people really,
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:11.540]  some people really hate,
[01:50:11.540 --> 01:50:13.800]  they haven't really changed it at all.
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:15.200]  The only way they've really changed it
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:18.160]  since we first saw it was to make it shorter
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:21.160]  on the escape key side to add an escape key.
[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:23.600]  Yeah, to make it do less.
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:25.280]  Yeah, so they just said, okay,
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:27.400]  it's no good at being a fake escape key,
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:29.980]  so we'll put the escape, all right, you got us.
[01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:32.080]  The escape key should be a real key.
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:34.080]  And then otherwise, what is the difference
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:36.180]  between the Touch Bar right now
[01:50:36.180 --> 01:50:40.280]  on the brand new RaveReview M1 MacBooks
[01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:41.760]  than the one we first saw?
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:42.600]  Nothing.
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:45.920]  And it's like, why not have haptics or something
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:49.380]  so you can reach up and feel the volume key or something?
[01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:50.720]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:52.380]  But I don't have strong opinions on it.
[01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:53.740]  Portrait mode, same way.
[01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:57.120]  I've taken some and I've gotten some shots from like, ah,
[01:50:57.120 --> 01:50:59.720]  especially when you're without pinching to zoom
[01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:01.520]  and you just look at it on the phone,
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:03.880]  it's like, yeah, that looks like a credible
[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:07.660]  sort of portrait style bokeh background photography.
[01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:08.920]  But I don't love it.
[01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:10.320]  And then every once in a while, you get one
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:12.940]  with a real boner and like, oh, jeez,
[01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:15.540]  look what it did to this person's glasses.
[01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:17.760]  It's just, it's like wrecked.
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:19.760]  And then I'm like, ah, I'm not using that anymore.
[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:21.080]  But I don't hate it.
[01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:24.740]  The way I feel about it is the way I felt,
[01:51:24.740 --> 01:51:29.480]  and the way I felt about digital photography period
[01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:33.260]  in like the late 90s, maybe around the year 2000,
[01:51:33.260 --> 01:51:37.540]  it's like, oh, I see, this is going to be the future.
[01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:40.000]  I'll just keep shooting film for now.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:40.840]  You know?
[01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:43.200]  I mean, so what I do is I would just,
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:45.720]  and thinking about it, I always take them both.
[01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:48.540]  I'll shoot the photo, the regular photo the regular way,
[01:51:48.540 --> 01:51:50.160]  just to make sure I have it.
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:51.640]  And then I switch to portrait mode
[01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:53.560]  and like screw with it a little more.
[01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:55.960]  And I think on this phone, it's,
[01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:58.560]  this is where every year I'm like the processor
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:00.000]  and the phone doesn't matter, it's so fast.
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:03.080]  Like all you're really buying is three years of headroom.
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:06.840]  But I think in some cases, portrait mode being one of them,
[01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:10.080]  the A14 makes it faster and makes it funner to use
[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:11.080]  because it's faster.
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:14.040]  And so like I, using it more,
[01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:16.720]  I'm not saying that I'm in love with the photos,
[01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:18.200]  but definitely I'm at the point
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:20.420]  where it's worth messing around with,
[01:52:20.420 --> 01:52:22.980]  because it doesn't carry that, you know,
[01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:24.940]  with the iPhone 7 when it first came out,
[01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:27.120]  you would like push it, it would take a while,
[01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:30.800]  and you're already on to wanting to take the next photo,
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:33.000]  and then you'd get like this weird cutout.
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.160]  Like all of that has been ripped away.
[01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:36.680]  Like they fixed it.
[01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:38.040]  And now you're at a place where,
[01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:39.800]  yeah, I'll try to take a couple, just see what happens.
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:41.800]  And that's, I think that's a big,
[01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:43.300]  it's an inflection point for these.
[01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:45.280]  And then sometimes it does a great job.
[01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:48.000]  Not all the time, but sometimes it does like a terrific job,
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.040]  and I think that's really impressive.
[01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:52.440]  Yeah, that's pretty much how I feel about it,
[01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:53.880]  but I don't like touch bar.
[01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:54.920]  Can we go back to complaining?
[01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:58.520]  Because I'm all cute, I'm all raring to go.
[01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:00.440]  So here's my theory.
[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:05.220]  No one at Apple is left-handed, slash has big hands.
[01:53:05.220 --> 01:53:07.800]  Every time you open a web browser with a touch bar,
[01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:10.200]  it puts the back button at the top left.
[01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:13.480]  And if you're left-handed like I am, you're pinky,
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:14.940]  and you're like in your weird, you know,
[01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:16.280]  like I didn't learn how to touch that,
[01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:17.120]  I just figured it out.
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:19.960]  So like my hands are all over the keyboard.
[01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:22.240]  I hit the back button in every web browser by accident
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:24.560]  on every touch bar Mac 500 times a day.
[01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:26.320]  I've had to install better touch tool.
[01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:28.640]  I've like disabled the whole thing
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:30.320]  because it's not a button.
[01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:32.060]  So on a regular keyboard, I just put my hands in there,
[01:53:32.060 --> 01:53:35.440]  and like I do things on purpose with a touch bar.
[01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:37.580]  I'm always just accidentally touching things,
[01:53:37.580 --> 01:53:39.720]  which is the opposite of what you want.
[01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:44.040]  And I can't extrapolate that experience to everyone,
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:45.380]  but I can certainly say, oh,
[01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:47.880]  this thing personally frustrates me all the time,
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:50.600]  such that I dinged you another 0.5 in this review,
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:51.700]  because you won't explain to me
[01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:54.200]  what the value of it is supposed to be.
[01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:57.680]  I just feel it's just, I don't know.
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:53:59.040]  I don't, I guess my,
[01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:00.920]  the reason I don't have the hatred some people have is
[01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:02.480]  I just never touch it accidentally.
[01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:03.680]  Because you're right-handed.
[01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:04.520]  Well, maybe.
[01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:05.640]  Because they put all the stuff
[01:54:05.640 --> 01:54:08.680]  that you can touch by accident in the right.
[01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:10.920]  But they're still crazy to me.
[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:13.720]  I'm more frustrated, like some people like you
[01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:16.680]  obviously have outright hate for it.
[01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:17.760]  Ben Thompson, same way.
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:20.020]  Ben Thompson will go out of his way to get,
[01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:22.680]  like it could do, you know,
[01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:24.760]  there was no doubt that he's gonna get the MacBook Air
[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:26.200]  because he wants it to,
[01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:28.300]  he'd pay more to get the buttons
[01:54:28.300 --> 01:54:31.280]  than to get the touch bar, right?
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:32.480]  I know other people feel that way.
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:33.320]  I don't.
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:36.320]  But I still, it's like I hardly ever use it, you know?
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:37.160]  And it's like some of the stuff they-
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:39.520]  You don't change the volume on your Mac?
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:41.640]  Well, I do change the volume.
[01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:42.920]  And I like changing the volume
[01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:45.920]  where you can just press it and then slide your finger.
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:49.860]  But a lot of the application-specific stuff I don't use.
[01:54:49.860 --> 01:54:52.760]  Like, I noticed the other day,
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:54.480]  it was actually when I was doing the thing,
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:56.720]  I told you where I set up a smart album to say,
[01:54:56.720 --> 01:54:58.600]  let me just look at all the photos I took
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:01.120]  with the telephoto lens on my previous iPhones
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:04.520]  before I actually commit to using the phone
[01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:06.160]  without it for a year.
[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:10.280]  And I noticed that Photos puts the thumbnails
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:12.360]  in the touch bar.
[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:13.920]  But they're so tight, like, what-
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:14.740]  What?
[01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:16.360]  Well-
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:18.400]  And it's like a cool demo.
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:19.880]  It's like you can put your finger on them
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:20.980]  and slide it across,
[01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:22.960]  and it's like you're going through thumbnails.
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:25.880]  But it was like, well, when would I ever use this?
[01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:26.720]  You know what I mean?
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:28.760]  Like, there's just so many apps
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:29.600]  where if you start-
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:30.600]  I start looking at it, I'm like,
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:32.760]  well, what does this app put in the touch bar?
[01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:36.120]  And it's like, oh, well, well, that's interesting.
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:37.520]  I'll never use it, you know?
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:39.320]  It's like my touch bar could stop working
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:40.880]  except for brightness and volume,
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:44.340]  and I would never notice.
[01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:45.180]  Yeah.
[01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:46.880]  I know we got to portrait mode,
[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:49.120]  but once you get me going on the touch bar, I can't stop.
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:50.440]  It's really-
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:51.280]  I'm like dying to know.
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:52.920]  Like, do people who are-
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:53.800]  Because if you're left-handed,
[01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:56.140]  you often have your dominant hand
[01:55:56.140 --> 01:55:57.840]  like slightly higher than the other one.
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:01.040]  And I push back in a web browser using the touch bar Mac
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:02.680]  so many times a day.
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:03.500]  I don't even know.
[01:56:03.500 --> 01:56:04.600]  Where is the back button?
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:06.640]  Is it over there next to escape?
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:07.480]  Yeah.
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:09.460]  It's the default place for both Safari and Chrome.
[01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:11.700]  And it is the single most irritating thing
[01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:13.160]  that can happen to you when you're using a computer
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:15.220]  is to be looking at something and have it just go away.
[01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:17.260]  Well, can't you turn it off?
[01:56:17.260 --> 01:56:18.100]  Can't you just go-
[01:56:18.100 --> 01:56:20.640]  Yeah, so I've had to effectively disable the whole thing.
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:21.480]  Yeah.
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:22.300]  Because there's-
[01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:23.840]  If you turn it on at a system level,
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:25.560]  every app will show you those things
[01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:28.000]  and you can't turn it off per app.
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.560]  Yeah.
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:32.360]  Hopefully, it's one of those things,
[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:36.040]  I guess, that, you know, corresponds to the-
[01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:39.920]  As a thing that hasn't really physically changed
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:42.520]  in a long time, it's up there with the webcam
[01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:45.320]  where, well, okay, they can get people to upgrade
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:50.400]  just if they say, here, now it's the M-2 MacBooks
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:53.760]  better webcam and somehow we've done something better
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:54.600]  with the touch bar.
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:56.600]  Because I don't think they're going away with it, you know?
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:56:58.000]  Like, I don't think they're gonna go back
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000]  and just give everybody buttons,
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.160]  but I feel like they need,
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:04.880]  it just needs to be taken to the next level.
[01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:07.920]  Haptics or something, right?
[01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:09.680]  Dieter's theory is that, you know,
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:10.620]  to get a better webcam,
[01:57:10.620 --> 01:57:13.240]  you probably need a thicker screen lid.
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:14.420]  Once you get a thicker screen lid,
[01:57:14.420 --> 01:57:15.920]  you could stick a touch controller in there.
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:18.680]  I'm just, it all comes back to the most obvious thing
[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:20.000]  you can do to a Mac to make it feel
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.040]  like the next generation of itself.
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:24.160]  Yeah, well, I do think that, you know,
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:28.320]  I mean, it's, a touch controller has to increase
[01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:30.200]  the thickness to some degree.
[01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:31.280]  Yeah, but if you're gonna make that,
[01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:34.200]  you might, if you're gonna do it for the webcam,
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:36.240]  you might as well get something else out of that space.
[01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:37.080]  Right.
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:38.520]  Well, and the other way to do it with the webcam
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:41.320]  would be to make a camera bump, which is like,
[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:45.000]  hey, well, you laugh, you laugh,
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:48.840]  but if, it's like, they slow-boiled us,
[01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:51.000]  we're all slow-boiling frogs
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.720]  with the camera bumps on our phones,
[01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:55.140]  because, I mean, and you guys had like,
[01:57:55.140 --> 01:57:56.520]  I think the best coverage of it,
[01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:58.320]  when they first came out with the camera bump
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:02.320]  on the iPhone 6, and they had like some marketing shots
[01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:06.240]  from the side that didn't show a camera bump.
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:09.880]  I remember the Verge specifically was like, whoa, whoa.
[01:58:09.880 --> 01:58:11.680]  They're showing this from the one side,
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:14.400]  and if you look at an iPhone 6 from that side,
[01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:16.840]  it has a, you can see the camera bump,
[01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:19.900]  and it's like, can you believe we wrote all that
[01:58:19.900 --> 01:58:22.640]  about the camera bump on the iPhone 6,
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:25.040]  which is like, I don't know, it's like a hangnail.
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:25.880]  Yeah.
[01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:30.040]  I mean, you laugh at the idea of a camera bump
[01:58:30.040 --> 01:58:33.200]  on the back of a MacBook, but, you know, I don't know.
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:36.080]  We're not laughing about our phone bumps anymore.
[01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:37.880]  Yeah, but the bump on a,
[01:58:38.780 --> 01:58:40.480]  I've thought about this way more than I should.
[01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:43.760]  The bump on a phone camera is the camera, right?
[01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:44.920]  It's facing the right direction,
[01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:48.500]  whereas on a MacBook, they would never put it on the inside.
[01:58:48.500 --> 01:58:49.720]  No, it would have to be on the back.
[01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:52.840]  So you would just have like a thing on the back,
[01:58:52.840 --> 01:58:54.600]  which would be crazy.
[01:58:55.700 --> 01:58:57.680]  Just like a big swollen.
[01:58:57.680 --> 01:58:59.120]  Yeah, I mean, look, there's a camera bump
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:00.200]  on the back of the iPad.
[01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:02.640]  It works just fine in the laptop mode, but it's facing out.
[01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:05.540]  Be like a little camera, like a camera beer belly.
[01:59:05.540 --> 01:59:08.160]  That's what they should call it.
[01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:09.400]  Jaws if you're listening.
[01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:13.760]  I mean, that's, to me, this is true on the iPhone 2.
[01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:16.760]  Apple's selfie cameras, the ones that face you,
[01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:21.080]  are by far their worst, also by far the most used.
[01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:21.920]  Yeah.
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:24.960]  And that's, if there's a place across the entire lineup
[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:26.360]  where you could say you could definitely,
[01:59:26.360 --> 01:59:29.600]  well, maybe, I don't know if they're most used on an iPad,
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:30.900]  but certainly in the age of Zoom
[01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:33.580]  that you're using that camera on a MacBook all the time.
[01:59:33.580 --> 01:59:36.960]  And then, I mean, what is all of TikTok, right?
[01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:39.060]  It's just front facing camera videos.
[01:59:39.060 --> 01:59:41.280]  And it's bizarre that it's the place
[01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:43.920]  where there seems to be the least amount of investment.
[01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:44.760]  Whereas on the back, they're like,
[01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:46.400]  this year we've added four new lenses,
[01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:50.000]  they have five different minute spec variations,
[01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:51.300]  and you're gonna take this many pictures
[01:59:51.300 --> 01:59:52.720]  of a sunset to find them.
[01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:53.540]  And then the front, it's like,
[01:59:53.540 --> 01:59:55.080]  it's the same one from two years ago.
[01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:59.040]  I salute, I've never seen one that I wanted to buy,
[01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:02.120]  but I salute all those Android handset makers
[02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:04.800]  making oddball high-end Android phones
[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:06.880]  where they have some kind of thing,
[02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:09.400]  maybe like a camera that flips around
[02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:11.640]  so that the back-facing camera can also be
[02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:13.660]  the self-facing camera.
[02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:17.000]  Because philosophically, it seems crazy
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:20.720]  that you've got a vastly, vastly better camera
[02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:23.840]  pointing back, and yet a lot of times
[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:26.320]  you want to take a picture forward
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:28.780]  and there's no good solution, right?
[02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:31.340]  It's like, you have the camera right there,
[02:00:31.340 --> 02:00:32.280]  you want to use it.
[02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:34.120]  Like you said, there's people just shooting
[02:00:34.120 --> 02:00:36.180]  tons and tons of it on social media.
[02:00:36.180 --> 02:00:39.980]  And yet, there's no good answer for it.
[02:00:39.980 --> 02:00:40.820]  I don't know.
[02:00:40.820 --> 02:00:41.900]  I thought that...
[02:00:41.900 --> 02:00:42.740]  Flip phones.
[02:00:42.740 --> 02:00:44.100]  I mean, it's like, they'll make the flip phone
[02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:45.340]  and then you'll just have the one camera.
[02:00:45.340 --> 02:00:47.060]  Like, I think Asus makes the one
[02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:49.560]  where the camera actually swivels on a motor.
[02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:52.100]  There's one where there's a periscope that comes up.
[02:00:52.100 --> 02:00:52.940]  That stuff is fun.
[02:00:52.940 --> 02:00:54.540]  All of it seems doomed to break.
[02:00:54.540 --> 02:00:56.460]  Yeah, that's exactly what I think.
[02:00:56.460 --> 02:01:00.260]  I'm like, I feel like everything that moves
[02:01:00.260 --> 02:01:03.120]  is doomed to break, and the last thing you want in there,
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:04.740]  you know, if it's just a volume button,
[02:01:04.740 --> 02:01:06.040]  it's like, okay, you just click it,
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:08.420]  but if it's like a whole camera system, forget it.
[02:01:08.420 --> 02:01:09.540]  Yes.
[02:01:09.540 --> 02:01:12.740]  Like, how many cameras of these Sony RX100s
[02:01:12.740 --> 02:01:14.340]  have just knocked the lens out of alignment?
[02:01:14.340 --> 02:01:16.500]  I'm like, well, there goes another one.
[02:01:16.500 --> 02:01:18.900]  Yeah, it's just like, you can't do that with your phone.
[02:01:18.900 --> 02:01:20.180]  No.
[02:01:20.180 --> 02:01:22.540]  Well, anyway, I feel like that's a wrap.
[02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:23.380]  I appreciate it.
[02:01:23.380 --> 02:01:25.860]  It's always good to talk to you after review season.
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:30.480]  It was good that we didn't have the usual exhausted...
[02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:31.720]  I can't believe we got through that again.
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:33.100]  We had a little space this time.
[02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:33.940]  Yeah, I know.
[02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:35.700]  Well, we'll see.
[02:01:35.700 --> 02:01:37.600]  Next year, maybe it'll be back to normal.
[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:38.440]  Hopefully.
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:40.060]  Yeah.
[02:01:40.060 --> 02:01:41.980]  Hey, we have a new podcast to promote.
[02:01:41.980 --> 02:01:44.020]  You have a new podcast.
[02:01:44.020 --> 02:01:46.340]  Not me, you, Decoder, right?
[02:01:46.340 --> 02:01:47.400]  Decoder, yeah.
[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:51.600]  So, as listeners may know,
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:53.660]  Kara Swisher hosted Recode Decode for a long time.
[02:01:53.660 --> 02:01:56.260]  She still hosts Pivot for our company,
[02:01:56.260 --> 02:01:57.140]  but she's on to the time.
[02:01:57.140 --> 02:01:58.060]  She's on the show.
[02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:03.520]  We've relaunched Recode Decode as Decoder with me
[02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:05.480]  on the feed, so if you're subscribed to Recode Decode,
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:06.320]  you're already subscribed.
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:08.460]  If not, go subscribe to Decoder.
[02:02:08.460 --> 02:02:11.180]  Interview show, we're aiming for CEOs
[02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:14.140]  and other people who make decisions at companies.
[02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:16.260]  I'm really interested in...
[02:02:16.260 --> 02:02:17.620]  Everything is a trade-off.
[02:02:17.620 --> 02:02:18.780]  Basically, what you and I have talked about
[02:02:18.780 --> 02:02:20.420]  for two hours now is trade-offs, right,
[02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:22.080]  and how we make products, how we sell them,
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:23.460]  what we use them for.
[02:02:24.620 --> 02:02:25.780]  I really wanna get in that, people.
[02:02:25.780 --> 02:02:29.260]  So, first episode is Mark Cuban, extremely fun.
[02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:31.500]  I just let him talk about whatever he wanted to talk about.
[02:02:31.500 --> 02:02:34.780]  Sal Khan from Khan Academy, trade-offs
[02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:36.700]  of just online learning.
[02:02:36.700 --> 02:02:38.280]  Xbox, Phil Spencer, I mentioned that,
[02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:42.940]  and then next week, this is coming out tonight.
[02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:46.260]  So, by the time this comes out,
[02:02:46.260 --> 02:02:49.160]  Shelly Taylor, who's the CEO of Alamo Draft House Theaters,
[02:02:50.380 --> 02:02:52.900]  gonna talk to me about how we're reopening theaters
[02:02:52.900 --> 02:02:53.740]  in the time of COVID.
[02:02:53.740 --> 02:02:57.840]  So, we're trying really hard to keep up the spirit
[02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:01.060]  of Recode Decode while expanding into sort of the larger
[02:03:01.060 --> 02:03:02.380]  what does it mean to run a company
[02:03:02.380 --> 02:03:04.520]  and be a leader in this moment.
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:07.940]  Well, trade-offs are everything.
[02:03:07.940 --> 02:03:09.900]  There's nothing else to talk about.
[02:03:09.900 --> 02:03:14.780]  I feel like we could, our job is always to explore
[02:03:14.780 --> 02:03:18.560]  and complain and talk about trade-offs.
[02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:19.400]  Yeah.
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:20.480]  Not a bad way to frame it.
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:23.740]  Yeah, and once you, you can listen to anybody
[02:03:23.740 --> 02:03:27.060]  interview anybody at this moment in podcasting history.
[02:03:27.060 --> 02:03:29.360]  So, I wanna make sure this one has a little bit
[02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:32.620]  of a focus in asking people who make decisions
[02:03:32.620 --> 02:03:33.580]  exactly how they do it.
[02:03:33.580 --> 02:03:35.080]  So, hopefully if people like it,
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:36.940]  you can subscribe to it, Decoder.
[02:03:36.940 --> 02:03:38.060]  Excellent.
[02:03:38.060 --> 02:03:39.220]  Well, thanks for being here, Levi.
[02:03:39.220 --> 02:03:40.100]  Talk to you soon.
[02:03:40.100 --> 02:04:03.100]  Always good to talk to you, John.
