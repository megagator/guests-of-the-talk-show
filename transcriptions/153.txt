[00:00.000 --> 00:03.600]  I have a good I told you I've told you before we started the show. I have a SodaStream story
[00:03.600 --> 00:10.420]  This is out of nowhere. I hear so it it psychoanalyzed me. I'm on your couch Ben. You're you're the the psychoanalyst
[00:12.320 --> 00:14.120]  So
[00:14.120 --> 00:19.320]  The context is I was looking for drink recommendations for the podcast and I decided to go with
[00:19.520 --> 00:22.000]  SodaStream and scotch in two separate glasses
[00:22.000 --> 00:24.000]  I drank my scotch straight to be clear
[00:24.000 --> 00:30.120]  Longtime listeners of the show know that I'm a firm believer that all you need to be successful in today's world
[00:30.280 --> 00:32.280]  You need three things you need
[00:33.680 --> 00:39.320]  Actually, I may be my three things have changed but I forget but right now I would say the three things you need is you
[00:39.320 --> 00:44.360]  Need you need good coffee fussy way to make coffee. You've got to be real fussy about it
[00:44.960 --> 00:46.960]  Make real good coffee
[00:47.600 --> 00:49.400]  You need
[00:49.400 --> 00:55.520]  Highly carbonated water and the only way to get it. It's in my opinion is to own your own SodaStream machine
[00:55.520 --> 00:59.400]  So you can you can carbonate your own water and you need a clicky keyboard
[00:59.760 --> 01:06.560]  That's those are my three keys to success that if you ask me why daring fireball and and this podcast are doing well
[01:06.640 --> 01:08.640]  It's that I have a fussy way to make
[01:08.880 --> 01:15.120]  Good coffee. I have a SodaStream and a super carbonated water and I have a very clicky keyboard
[01:15.120 --> 01:17.120]  I have an Apple extended keyboard, too
[01:17.120 --> 01:18.360]  um
[01:18.360 --> 01:21.680]  Here's the problem. The problem is about a week ago
[01:23.280 --> 01:25.280]  My current
[01:25.760 --> 01:28.560]  Carbonation canister and my SodaStream ran out of
[01:30.320 --> 01:32.320]  Co2 and
[01:32.800 --> 01:37.320]  So it's always so demoralizing when that happens, it's just like the little the little piffed into the water
[01:37.580 --> 01:41.360]  Well, here's my in my my strategy for years
[01:41.360 --> 01:48.460]  I mean years now has been that I have four canisters of co2 and when three get empty I
[01:49.800 --> 01:51.320]  Go to
[01:51.320 --> 01:53.320]  There's a Williams Sonoma
[01:53.480 --> 01:59.240]  Across town right in Center City, Philadelphia. I take the three empty ones to to the Williams Sonoma. I
[02:00.440 --> 02:04.640]  Exchange them you get like a discount when you give them the empties and you can buy new ones
[02:05.680 --> 02:07.120]  So I always buy three at a time
[02:07.120 --> 02:11.840]  But then I have my fourth that's in the canister so I don't have to you know, it's like I'm out
[02:12.100 --> 02:13.080]  Well, here's the thing
[02:13.080 --> 02:19.200]  I my thing ran out last week and I've had this thing for years and I went down to where I keep the empties down
[02:19.200 --> 02:23.720]  In our bottom floor, but it's not really a basement. It's sort of a bottom floor and they weren't there
[02:23.720 --> 02:27.000]  I don't know where I don't know where the hell my other ones are
[02:27.000 --> 02:30.840]  I and I spent all day and I asked I asked Amy I
[02:30.840 --> 02:37.480]  I we looked at I looked everywhere. I don't know where the hell I put my I don't know what happened at some point in
[02:37.480 --> 02:39.480]  the last few weeks or months I
[02:40.240 --> 02:43.560]  Either me or I suspect quite frankly
[02:44.200 --> 02:46.200]  my wife moved
[02:46.400 --> 02:49.400]  my my refill canisters and
[02:50.400 --> 02:56.660]  I don't know where the hell they are. So I couldn't make fizzy water. And so I was stuck buying
[02:56.660 --> 03:01.260]  What I did is I started buying like Pellegrino and and
[03:01.820 --> 03:06.780]  Some Perrier cuz I even forget like I'm so used to making my own I forget which I like better
[03:07.420 --> 03:08.340]  That's that's what I do
[03:08.340 --> 03:15.100]  I buy the I have the 24-pack Perrier at Costco that I keep for like car rides and and
[03:15.340 --> 03:18.860]  In case I run out. Yeah, I think I like Perrier better than Pellegrino
[03:18.860 --> 03:21.180]  I think Perrier is a little bit more bite to it
[03:21.180 --> 03:25.500]  But either way I but then I'd run out and I couldn't make more and I was dehydrated. I
[03:25.500 --> 03:31.780]  I mean I was dehydrated because I cannot drink flat water. It's just awful and
[03:33.780 --> 03:38.140]  Here the days are going by and I'm dehydrated and I'm miserable and
[03:39.180 --> 03:42.820]  Even when I have the stuff in the house, even when I have like the Perrier or whatever
[03:42.820 --> 03:49.340]  I'm unhappy with it because it's nowhere near carbonated enough for my taste and then I realized this is literally yesterday
[03:49.340 --> 03:55.460]  I realized you know what? I could just go to the goddamn Williams Sonoma and the buy a couple more canisters of this stuff and
[03:56.740 --> 04:04.700]  If and when I find the ones that are somewhere in my house, I'll use them eventually too and I can still take
[04:05.380 --> 04:12.340]  Even though I'll have more empty canisters than I need. I'll just take them all but it doesn't why did it take me a week?
[04:12.340 --> 04:16.180]  This is my question. Why did it take me a week to realize I can just go there and and
[04:16.180 --> 04:18.180]  buy the goddamn
[04:19.260 --> 04:21.260]  Refills that I need
[04:21.460 --> 04:27.580]  Why did I make myself miserable for a week then I laugh because I have done the exact same thing
[04:27.580 --> 04:30.460]  I will get to so here you you'll be used by about a department store
[04:30.460 --> 04:33.100]  I'll get to the department store and like oh shoot
[04:33.100 --> 04:36.220]  I wanted to get more canisters, but I forgot to bring it and then I don't buy it
[04:36.220 --> 04:42.640]  And then I I don't have any car eating canisters. It's totally illogical and I do the exact same thing
[04:42.640 --> 04:46.720]  I've I somehow convinced myself that I need the one-for-one
[04:47.680 --> 04:48.760]  exchange
[04:48.760 --> 04:52.960]  To to get the refills when I don't I don't I didn't need that
[04:52.960 --> 04:58.800]  I just went there with the one refill that I had because of the one that was you know that I just emptied and
[04:59.280 --> 05:01.040]  And did it I?
[05:01.040 --> 05:06.040]  Will say the canisters no no and my wife said you know as soon as you come home
[05:06.040 --> 05:07.980]  You're going to find those canisters
[05:07.980 --> 05:13.560]  And and I said she was waiting she was waiting for you to leave and then she was gonna smuggle them back to the shelf
[05:13.560 --> 05:18.200]  Where they were so you would show up and find them right well that seems like the Murphy's law way that it would roll
[05:18.200 --> 05:19.480]  But it did not actually happen
[05:19.480 --> 05:25.680]  I'd I still have no idea where the hell the the canisters are if anybody knows where my extra canisters are please please
[05:26.320 --> 05:28.320]  Tweet at me or send me an email
[05:32.920 --> 05:37.560]  It occurs to me it does occur to me because it's it's like having a superpower
[05:37.560 --> 05:40.000]  Having as many Twitter followers as I have
[05:40.880 --> 05:44.980]  And you know I think you're in the same boat. It can be a superpower like
[05:45.600 --> 05:50.560]  On the last episode with guy English when I was wondering what the hell
[05:50.680 --> 05:54.180]  You probably don't remember this because you I don't think you were a Mac user back then, but I was
[05:55.000 --> 06:01.680]  Wondering about there was this chooser extension for the classic Mac OS that if you had a local talk network if you if
[06:01.920 --> 06:04.000]  Other people had this chooser extension
[06:04.000 --> 06:06.000]  You
[06:06.000 --> 06:09.080]  Could effectively show you could like chat to them you could
[06:10.080 --> 06:15.480]  If we both had it I could look your machine if I knew and I knew your Mac's name
[06:15.480 --> 06:21.840]  I could send you a message, so it was effectively like instant messaging over the local talk network
[06:22.600 --> 06:27.800]  back in the very early 90s, and I could not remember the name of the chooser extension and
[06:27.800 --> 06:36.200]  And googling for anything like pre-google is very difficult very difficult and and googling for this
[06:36.560 --> 06:39.640]  Particular problem really unless there's some better way to phrase it
[06:40.720 --> 06:43.880]  There's a common word involved. Yeah. Yeah, it doesn't give you the answer
[06:45.560 --> 06:51.680]  And so I asked on Twitter and within like five minutes somebody was you know had the answer it was called broadcast
[06:51.680 --> 06:56.600]  And as soon as they said broadcast I was like that's it and then somebody even posted screenshots of it
[06:56.600 --> 06:58.600]  Which is amazing because if you type
[06:58.960 --> 07:05.360]  Broadcast chooser extension classic Mac OS into Google you still don't get the screenshots in there like image search
[07:05.360 --> 07:11.280]  It's it's literally on Google ball even if you know the name of it, but asking on Twitter
[07:12.320 --> 07:17.360]  Got me the answer and I have to say it does occur it often occurs to me in situations
[07:17.360 --> 07:20.500]  I think when I'm looking for the soda stream of my house like I should ask
[07:20.500 --> 07:26.460]  On Twitter, and then I realized no nobody on Twitter is going to be able to help me on this it
[07:27.020 --> 07:29.020]  Is it is support me
[07:30.100 --> 07:32.100]  Yeah, it's um I
[07:32.780 --> 07:37.900]  Yeah, it's funny. I realize I just kind of did that today. I was I was thought about the mini Microsoft
[07:37.900 --> 07:42.340]  Do you remember that guy? Oh? Yeah? He was great. Well. It's great. Yeah. He's kind of stopped, right?
[07:43.260 --> 07:44.820]  Yeah, no. That's why I asked
[07:44.820 --> 07:47.460]  He's just selling I don't know why I the guy just suddenly occurred to me
[07:47.460 --> 07:53.400]  So I just threw it on Twitter what happened to mini Microsoft and I heard from someone actually kind of off the record that said
[07:53.400 --> 07:55.400]  That they he left Microsoft
[07:55.940 --> 08:00.060]  You tell me who it was but um and then of course the joke is you know cuz you left
[08:00.060 --> 08:05.800]  You know he piped down around the time Stephen Sernoffsky was there's always a joke that Stephen Sernoffsky was actually
[08:06.540 --> 08:13.220]  Was actually mini Microsoft especially he was very complimentary of Sernoffsky in general, and you know very anti very anti Ballmer
[08:13.220 --> 08:17.860]  Um so it was actually it's not so he jumped in on the thread is like oh you got me
[08:17.900 --> 08:21.920]  But um, but no it's funny actually the funny the funniest answer though was was was
[08:22.500 --> 08:28.420]  Contra counter notions are our anonymous friend where he said he's now known as mini Amazon
[08:28.420 --> 08:31.460]  which is probably true given that he was that he was at Microsoft, but
[08:33.620 --> 08:38.820]  Yeah that that's like the most inside of both the Seattle and tech jokes as you can get
[08:38.820 --> 08:41.860]  Many of my great yeah, he used to
[08:42.900 --> 08:49.420]  And it was he it looked so beautiful too because he'd spelled Microsoft with the stock quote
[08:50.300 --> 08:57.940]  MSFT so it was M I N I M S F T and somehow like that like eight-character
[08:58.980 --> 09:04.940]  Name it looked very balanced to me, and and he was a guy for years who ran a blog where he
[09:04.940 --> 09:08.220]  And I think I don't think anybody disputes that he actually worked there
[09:08.220 --> 09:11.900]  I mean you can't he was anonymous obviously or pseudonymous would be a better way
[09:11.900 --> 09:16.420]  But he was like a pseudonymous Apple or not Apple Microsoft
[09:17.820 --> 09:23.740]  Longtime Microsoft employee who was a critic of the late Ballmer era
[09:25.420 --> 09:31.180]  But he was a critic who loved Microsoft right like that's a that's what made it so compelling and saw
[09:31.180 --> 09:38.780]  Saw tremendous potential there, and I think in hindsight was largely proven correct that what he saw as
[09:39.420 --> 09:43.340]  Folly you know and I think folly is a good way to put it
[09:44.060 --> 09:46.060]  Turned out to be correct
[09:48.220 --> 09:50.220]  Yeah, no absolutely
[09:51.260 --> 09:57.340]  And and the other thing that was amazing about it too was he had these unbelievable comment threads and all his posts because everyone at
[09:57.340 --> 09:58.620]  Microsoft was like
[09:58.620 --> 10:06.860]  Yeah, and so he would have these thousand comment long posts that up like debating stuff going back and forth like it was
[10:06.860 --> 10:09.100]  I mean he slowed down a lot the site's still there
[10:09.100 --> 10:17.500]  It's it's mini MSFT dot blogspot dot com but but I mean at the time especially when he was posting regularly like it was like the
[10:17.500 --> 10:23.420]  Outlet for for like Microsoft inks and complaints and all that sort of stuff. It was really something else. Yeah
[10:23.420 --> 10:30.700]  Imagine we had that imagine we had someone at Apple doing that like how how how many black ops would they bring in to find out?
[10:30.700 --> 10:33.740]  Who the guy was or who the gal was or whatever it might be?
[10:34.540 --> 10:38.220]  I don't think I you know that's interesting. I know that some people
[10:40.460 --> 10:44.860]  Think that I I wonder if they would I mean my understanding I know that that that
[10:45.180 --> 10:48.780]  Off-the-cuff that a lot of people seem to think that Apple
[10:48.780 --> 10:54.220]  Does um, what would you call it? Counter? Espionage?
[10:56.060 --> 10:59.820]  You know, but they don't that Apple does not
[11:02.620 --> 11:08.780]  Really my understanding I mean I can't prove it but my understanding is that Apple doesn't really have like
[11:10.540 --> 11:14.300]  Anybody inside who like investigates leaks or anything like that
[11:14.300 --> 11:22.940]  That they don't and specifically they don't because they think that if it ever leaked that they have a team that investigates leaks
[11:22.940 --> 11:30.460]  It would be the so so bad PR wise that it would be worse than the actual leaks and that the only reason that so little
[11:30.780 --> 11:32.780]  Tends to leak from Apple is
[11:32.940 --> 11:37.740]  Really, even even as their head current head count grows. It's literally just the
[11:38.380 --> 11:40.380]  internal culture of
[11:40.380 --> 11:47.340]  People who work here don't leak. Yeah, well, then I'll tell you too on the on the first day on the orientation like
[11:48.220 --> 11:52.700]  Like this orientation is very upbeat and all these great things about Apple and history and blah blah blah
[11:52.860 --> 12:00.060]  And then like this very stern looking security woman came in and like I I'm telling you we're a bunch of interns when I was there
[12:00.060 --> 12:02.860]  So like we're all kind of young and impressionable anyway
[12:02.860 --> 12:06.940]  But she put the holy fear of God in you like it was incredible
[12:06.940 --> 12:11.980]  It was it was it was delightful looking at it from the outside even as sitting there. You're like, holy crap
[12:11.980 --> 12:13.980]  I will never leak anything ever again
[12:14.860 --> 12:16.860]  It was it was it was awesome
[12:17.740 --> 12:20.540]  I remember her big example was IFO Apple store
[12:20.540 --> 12:25.900]  I think like the old the old the the old blog that that tracked Apple stores and she was like
[12:26.540 --> 12:29.820]  Yeah, I can't remember what the context was. I just remember that blog
[12:30.460 --> 12:32.460]  Was one of the examples she had
[12:32.460 --> 12:37.500]  But yeah, it was something else. But yeah, no, I agree. Obviously a harsh presentation is not gonna last that long
[12:37.500 --> 12:40.140]  it's it's absolutely a cultural cultural thing and
[12:41.740 --> 12:47.420]  Yeah, it's like there I remember going into an office and like my first couple days and someone
[12:48.060 --> 12:51.580]  Like and I was kind of jarred that they didn't hold the door open for me
[12:51.580 --> 12:57.100]  But like that would that's just the way that just you don't you don't do that right because you don't know that
[12:57.340 --> 12:59.340]  I have to badge in
[12:59.340 --> 13:03.980]  Right, you don't know though. It is it's totally a thing. Yeah. Yeah. All right
[13:03.980 --> 13:07.580]  You don't know that the guy behind you actually has the credentials to come in. All right
[13:08.220 --> 13:13.260]  You know that the guy right especially especially because the different different parts of the apple
[13:13.820 --> 13:19.100]  Will be like specified by the badge. So even though you have an apple badge, you can't necessarily get into all parts of apple
[13:19.100 --> 13:21.100]  right, so
[13:21.820 --> 13:26.380]  The guy who wrote IFO Apple store, you know, he died recently. Yeah, it's very interesting
[13:26.380 --> 13:29.500]  I was just thinking about that one. His name was Gary Allen
[13:29.500 --> 13:33.900]  I'll put a link in the show notes, but it was a good site and and it's funny because
[13:35.660 --> 13:38.700]  A lot of people I noticed I mean I wasn't like it wasn't like, you know
[13:38.700 --> 13:44.060]  first thing I do in the morning is check IFO Apple store, but you know in the racket that i'm in I obviously
[13:44.060 --> 13:49.020]  You know would come across it and it occurred to me at one point that boy IFO Apple store has really died down
[13:49.020 --> 13:53.420]  I wonder if the guy is sort of just lost his interest in it or it you know
[13:53.420 --> 13:59.900]  Now that the stores have rolled out worldwide. Is it just not interesting? And then it turned out it was you know, he was he was ill and
[14:01.900 --> 14:03.900]  I think he died
[14:04.220 --> 14:10.540]  Last fall I just look yeah, and you know, what's it's in the sights down. It's like it's a bummer. It's just yeah. I'm back later
[14:12.220 --> 14:18.140]  Suddenly I suddenly feel very mortal both because one we're like we're both getting older two
[14:18.140 --> 14:20.140]  we're talking about death and three like
[14:20.140 --> 14:25.660]  Making my living on the web and going to this guy's website that he poured his life into and there's nothing there is like now
[14:25.660 --> 14:32.220]  I'm really bummed out. I think he's written about it publicly, but my pal and you know longtime blogger at waxy.org
[14:32.220 --> 14:36.780]  Andy Bayo has you know thought about this for a long time. I mean years ago
[14:37.740 --> 14:44.300]  That that there should be some sort of you know, his idea is to somehow set up some kind of a trust
[14:44.300 --> 14:50.700]  Where people with websites can you know?
[14:51.660 --> 14:52.860]  Pay for them. Yeah
[14:52.860 --> 15:00.300]  You'd somehow somehow set up a trust where and and some sort of and like a trusted organization where you would put you know
[15:00.780 --> 15:03.100]  Trust them with the credentials for your website
[15:03.740 --> 15:05.420]  um
[15:05.420 --> 15:08.780]  And so that you can you know with some sort of?
[15:09.900 --> 15:12.380]  modicum of of financial backing
[15:12.380 --> 15:18.700]  That to keep websites up in perpetuity after you know, cuz I've you know, you know, let's face it. We're all gonna die eventually
[15:19.740 --> 15:21.740]  No, I mean
[15:21.740 --> 15:28.220]  No, it's awesome. It's something like that that WordPress or whoever should think about like there should be a button to like export as HTML and like
[15:29.580 --> 15:32.780]  Actually, I word WordPress to do this. I'll talk to Matt about it like
[15:33.500 --> 15:38.300]  Imagine being able to have it in a will whatever you you can export the site. So it's just HTML
[15:38.300 --> 15:41.740]  They're not rendering every time so it's not taking any compute resources. It's super lightweight
[15:41.740 --> 15:44.940]  And yeah, you put down it wouldn't be that much
[15:45.340 --> 15:50.460]  Honestly to be able to serve a static web page for for a very long time
[15:50.460 --> 15:56.060]  I think in the long run the biggest expense honestly would be the keeping the domain name registered. I
[15:56.940 --> 15:58.220]  You know
[15:58.220 --> 16:05.660]  And as you know, even if it's only six seven bucks a year in the long run for a statically rendered version of during fireball
[16:05.660 --> 16:09.420]  And especially as time goes on let's face it. But you know, let's just say a hundred years from now
[16:09.420 --> 16:12.980]  Uh, it's not gonna be a lot of traffic on this site
[16:15.780 --> 16:21.380]  This kind of sounds a little narcissistic when you put it that way who's gonna be reading the year 2100
[16:21.380 --> 16:23.980]  Let me see what's your tech read our comment say about this, right?
[16:23.980 --> 16:30.740]  but at least but I would like to think that it'll still be there for people to refer to and that somebody who
[16:31.420 --> 16:37.620]  You know who wants to refer to it that they can still point to the URL and it'll still respond
[16:37.620 --> 16:41.100]  This is why I'll put the the I think I said this the last time was your podcast, too
[16:41.100 --> 16:44.140]  I have a recurring donation set up for the Internet Archive and
[16:44.340 --> 16:48.740]  Like it's something I would counsel everyone to do because that is such an unbelievable resource
[16:48.740 --> 16:55.100]  It's the closest that we have. Yeah, it is and and and they do they do like really important work
[16:55.100 --> 16:59.020]  and I use it a lot I use it a lot for for my for researching stuff because
[16:59.500 --> 17:03.420]  Stuff disappears all the time. Like you'll you'll especially when you talk about the pre-google stuff
[17:03.420 --> 17:07.700]  You're trying to find stuff back in the day and you find that you find a link and you know at the end of the link
[17:07.700 --> 17:11.020]  Is what you need and then crap it's gone and then you go to Internet Archive and it's there
[17:11.020 --> 17:14.020]  So yeah, I set it up just an automatic donation every single month
[17:14.700 --> 17:20.180]  Because I mean one it's awesome two it's important and three it's like super important to my work. So yeah
[17:22.620 --> 17:27.140]  It is I've said this to people multiple times and it's one of those things I'll get to someday
[17:27.140 --> 17:31.940]  But it's one of those things where if I had like an intern or an employee or something
[17:31.940 --> 17:33.940]  but it is
[17:35.780 --> 17:39.460]  Astoundingly depressing how if you go back to like
[17:40.060 --> 17:46.900]  2004 and which was the first year where I had the the link list feature on daring fireball where I'd linked to things on a daily
[17:46.900 --> 17:48.900]  basis
[17:49.060 --> 17:53.140]  It's absolutely astounding how many of those links are 404s at this point and
[17:53.700 --> 17:57.900]  Kaki, I've talked about this like because Kaki has been doing his thing since like 1998
[17:57.900 --> 18:01.380]  If you go back to the earlier, I mean the longer you go back
[18:01.380 --> 18:06.860]  It's like almost exponential if you go back to the earlier year the earliest years of Kaki. It's it's even worse
[18:06.860 --> 18:10.260]  It's like there are the even just every year you go back
[18:10.780 --> 18:16.740]  It's worse and worse and worse. It makes a difference if it's like 2005 versus 2003 versus 2001
[18:18.140 --> 18:24.700]  It's absolutely astounding how many links are 404s really it's depressing. So my idea would be to hire somebody
[18:24.700 --> 18:26.700]  to go back and
[18:26.860 --> 18:33.980]  For every dead link see if it's available at archive org and if it is change the link to the archive or version
[18:37.580 --> 18:40.940]  It makes sense and also then it comes back to like well
[18:41.580 --> 18:46.540]  Who's how many people are gonna actually click these links? Yeah, but it's I just want it to be right
[18:46.540 --> 18:49.980]  You know what? I mean? It has nothing to do with me. No, I totally get it
[18:49.980 --> 18:59.180]  It's just that it just bothers me in a I don't know it isn't, you know in a way that my obsessions, you know
[19:00.220 --> 19:06.220]  It's I know that it's the right thing to do and it doesn't matter whether it bothers you to know that there's a bunch of
[19:06.220 --> 19:12.380]  Bad links and you know in your stream, right and I don't want any blink on during fireball to ever go bad
[19:12.380 --> 19:14.380]  I really do. I mean it. I mean I want
[19:14.380 --> 19:22.620]  everything that I've ever posted it during firewall to be a you know, a valid URL in perpetuity long past
[19:22.620 --> 19:24.620]  You know when I'm I'm
[19:24.860 --> 19:26.860]  dead I
[19:29.820 --> 19:35.420]  Was gonna say in the ground I doubt I really doubt that I'm gonna be put in the ground so I wasn't sure
[19:36.460 --> 19:41.420]  We have taken such a morbid turn. I know I think we started with we started with sparkling water
[19:41.420 --> 19:46.140]  And now we're in the ground. Well, I was gonna say until I'm in the ground. This is why I hesitated there
[19:46.140 --> 19:49.900]  I was gonna say in the ground and then I realized I really I don't want to be buried
[19:49.900 --> 19:53.660]  I think that's you know antiquated in a waste of a waste of real estate
[19:53.660 --> 19:58.700]  And so I was gonna say burned up, but then I realized if I said burned up, it's as though I'm predicting
[19:59.580 --> 20:01.820]  That I'm gonna die a terrible fire
[20:02.460 --> 20:05.740]  Which is you know, I hopefully will not be the way that I go
[20:05.740 --> 20:10.620]  Hopefully, you'll be already dead before you enter the terrible fire, right? Exactly. Uh,
[20:11.020 --> 20:15.020]  Well, what what better segue into my first thanking my first sponsor
[20:17.180 --> 20:21.900]  Hey, you're lucky I just because you launched right into it so I I had to do the panic hit record
[20:21.900 --> 20:25.660]  So I was gonna break I was gonna break. Oh, you should always be recording down
[20:27.180 --> 20:32.300]  No, I did I did I was only five seconds late. Don't worry. You missed the what's up the very enthusiastic. What's up?
[20:32.300 --> 20:39.820]  Our first sponsor is uh, our good friends at wealth front wealth front is an automated investment service
[20:39.820 --> 20:43.980]  They have over three billion dollars in client assets under management
[20:44.620 --> 20:51.420]  They manage a diversified continually rebalanced portfolio of index funds on behalf of their clients
[20:52.140 --> 20:55.740]  In a low cost and tax efficient manner
[20:56.380 --> 20:59.260]  So what you see here is that
[20:59.260 --> 21:05.920]  Efficient manner so what you do is you give well front your money and it is effectively
[21:06.460 --> 21:11.740]  Set it and forget it you don't go there and it's not like this is where you go to day trade and and
[21:12.140 --> 21:16.940]  Something like that and pick pick individual companies and and and things like that
[21:17.500 --> 21:22.220]  This is the complete opposite of this. This is not short-term active market timing trading
[21:23.420 --> 21:26.060]  This is put it in there and this is a
[21:26.060 --> 21:32.240]  A algorithm they have algorithms that are really measured for the long term
[21:32.640 --> 21:39.200]  And research shows that when individuals attempt to time the markets attempt to day trade attempt to pick individual stocks
[21:39.840 --> 21:41.080]  uh
[21:41.080 --> 21:42.400]  overwhelmingly
[21:42.400 --> 21:45.200]  They underperform, uh index funds
[21:45.840 --> 21:48.400]  And in large part because of the higher costs
[21:49.440 --> 21:54.960]  Higher taxes and just the fact that you've it's really hard to to beat the index funds
[21:54.960 --> 21:56.560]  um
[21:56.560 --> 22:00.400]  So here's a big advantage to wealthfront. They charge no trading commissions
[22:00.960 --> 22:04.640]  uh, and they charge an advisory fee of
[22:06.300 --> 22:08.320]  0.25 percent per year
[22:09.040 --> 22:13.760]  That's one fourth of one percent and that's only on assets above ten thousand dollars
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.360]  So if you only put less than ten thousand dollars into your wealthfront account
[22:17.680 --> 22:24.160]  Which is how people they know this is what people do and and it makes total sense people who get started with well wealthfront
[22:24.160 --> 22:29.360]  put like play money in there just to see if it works and then when they see that it works and they
[22:29.680 --> 22:35.600]  Give trust then they put quote-unquote real money into to wealthfront and only when you're over ten thousand dollars
[22:35.680 --> 22:40.640]  Do they start charging fees and even then the fee is only one fourth of one percent
[22:41.840 --> 22:44.640]  And you can get an additional five thousand dollars
[22:45.360 --> 22:46.320]  free
[22:46.320 --> 22:51.920]  For each friend you recommend to wealthfront and those people who you recommend your friends who you say hey, man
[22:51.920 --> 22:55.120]  I'm putting all my money in wealthfront and and you can get into
[22:55.600 --> 22:58.160]  uh, they get the five thousand dollars extra too, so
[22:58.880 --> 23:01.440]  There's no and there's no limit to the amount you can get managed free
[23:01.520 --> 23:07.360]  So put a whole bunch of friends in there and you can keep getting more and more that has no fees at all. Um,
[23:08.560 --> 23:14.400]  It's really really low fee really, uh optimized for the long term
[23:15.200 --> 23:16.640]  uh
[23:16.640 --> 23:23.040]  There's so much more and and they're they're experts on this. I'm not an expert on on investing or anything like that
[23:23.120 --> 23:29.360]  Other than the fact that I am a true believer in putting your long-term investments into index funds as a basic idea
[23:29.920 --> 23:31.200]  um
[23:31.200 --> 23:33.200]  So go there and find out more
[23:33.840 --> 23:35.840]  Uh and the url
[23:36.160 --> 23:38.160]  This is where you go wealthfront
[23:39.280 --> 23:41.280]  dot com slash the
[23:41.980 --> 23:43.120]  talk show
[23:43.120 --> 23:47.600]  Uh, really? It's it's just a great way to invest your money and it's super easy
[23:48.080 --> 23:52.640]  You just go there. You just it's no work. It's no work and your money is in uh
[23:53.440 --> 23:58.960]  In my opinion the safest, uh sort of investment that you can in the long run, which is index funds
[23:59.360 --> 24:07.200]  And they take care of all the details. Um, and they really do it in a way that minimizes your taxes and maximizes the long-term
[24:07.200 --> 24:13.520]  Um, uh after-tax returns that you'll get on your investment, so go to wealthfront.com slash the talk show
[24:15.840 --> 24:19.200]  Uh, we have a lot to talk about it's a good thing we wasted the first half hour
[24:20.400 --> 24:23.040]  On sparkling water on sparkling water nonsense
[24:24.320 --> 24:29.440]  We do uh multiple multiple topics, uh, and I think all apple related but
[24:30.000 --> 24:34.640]  Well, I want to talk to you about this stupid amazon echo that you talked me into buying
[24:34.640 --> 24:36.640]  Oh, that's right
[24:36.640 --> 24:39.520]  But we should talk about apple apple first
[24:41.360 --> 24:46.960]  And we should get to both both the apple iphone and to you and you and guys discussion on the services
[24:47.280 --> 24:53.280]  Yeah, which I thought was actually really good. I enjoyed it. I just I had one one one edition to make well make it now
[24:53.280 --> 24:54.880]  Let's do that first. Let's do that
[24:54.880 --> 25:01.840]  so last week's show guy and I spent a long time talking about your recent piece on on apple and services and and
[25:01.840 --> 25:05.120]  Their their organizational structure. So tell me what you quibble with
[25:06.320 --> 25:12.880]  The only thing I would say is is when I say apple services i'm talking about much more than just icloud
[25:13.120 --> 25:15.120]  and I think that that was a
[25:15.360 --> 25:15.680]  uh
[25:15.680 --> 25:21.840]  I did say that an article but I probably could have made the point more forcefully because people hear apple services and they think
[25:22.080 --> 25:24.080]  iCloud like icloud as it is
[25:24.640 --> 25:29.760]  I actually agree with you. It's mostly fine. Um, I think they prompt for your password when you're talking about
[25:29.760 --> 25:33.360]  um, I think they prompt for your password way too much for one, uh, but
[25:33.920 --> 25:37.600]  But when when I talk about services that includes things like the app store
[25:38.080 --> 25:45.280]  Like that is a service and I don't think it's run optimally like and I think it's to apple actually to apple's detriment
[25:45.600 --> 25:50.080]  Uh, it's things like apple pay it's things like homekit. It's all these
[25:50.700 --> 25:56.320]  Ancillary things and I think where they actually struggle the most in many cases is places where they have to foster
[25:56.320 --> 26:02.980]  Ecosystems like they have to get merchants to adopt apple pay they need to they need to get device makers to to integrate with
[26:03.380 --> 26:05.700]  With homekit they need to make it so
[26:06.020 --> 26:12.820]  Developers can build sustainable businesses on the app store like all those go into the services bucket and I think in general
[26:13.300 --> 26:16.020]  apple is not good at those and it's not just the
[26:16.580 --> 26:22.100]  timing issue it's the control issue like a big reason why apple sucks at that stuff is they
[26:22.100 --> 26:27.300]  They have a very hard time of letting go of control and so that
[26:27.860 --> 26:33.540]  That was the one thing you guys didn't talk about that part and I actually think that's the more important part because that's the potential
[26:33.540 --> 26:35.380]  Part that's what apple
[26:35.380 --> 26:38.500]  Like it's so easy to look at stuff that companies do poorly
[26:39.220 --> 26:45.380]  But often the bigger to greater damage is the stuff that's not done the advantages that aren't taken
[26:45.780 --> 26:50.580]  Advantage of or the opportunities aren't taken advantage of and so that was just the one kind of missing piece
[26:50.580 --> 26:52.580]  I don't you think apple pay is a good
[26:52.820 --> 26:56.340]  Don't you think apple pay is an example of apple getting it right where they?
[26:56.820 --> 27:02.980]  It have they've built this thing on top of they they're not requiring people to have an apple retailers to have
[27:03.460 --> 27:05.460]  a apple pay proprietary
[27:06.100 --> 27:12.260]  Sensor it's it's this thing that works, you know with with anybody, you know, it works with android phones
[27:12.340 --> 27:14.340]  It's it was already there
[27:14.500 --> 27:17.860]  Like some retailers on day one could just say okay, we're in
[27:18.740 --> 27:20.100]  um
[27:20.100 --> 27:23.860]  And I think that the growth in apple pay is actually pretty impressive
[27:25.780 --> 27:27.220]  I I so
[27:27.220 --> 27:32.580]  And I think apple pay is actually a really interesting example to talk about and the reason is because first off
[27:32.900 --> 27:35.700]  Because there's multiple components that that go into apple pay
[27:36.100 --> 27:42.500]  So first off the there's the actual hardware aspect of it, which is brilliantly done. I mean it works really well
[27:42.820 --> 27:46.820]  There is one downside which is I personally I trigger apple pay too often
[27:46.820 --> 27:50.660]  Uh, just in general day-to-day use which is kind of annoying especially since I have it in taiwan
[27:50.660 --> 27:53.380]  And it's not really available here. Uh, that part's awesome
[27:53.940 --> 27:55.940]  The and which makes sense apple
[27:55.940 --> 28:02.580]  It's it's a beautiful example of apple integrating all the different pieces that go into making that experience work flawlessly
[28:02.740 --> 28:04.740]  So the hardware aspect is amazing
[28:05.380 --> 28:08.340]  to and the secure enclave and all that sort of stuff to
[28:09.060 --> 28:10.260]  uh apple
[28:10.260 --> 28:12.740]  brought the banks to heal very effectively and
[28:12.740 --> 28:18.180]  And in general if you look at apple in eddie q's division and all that sort of stuff from a business development perspective
[28:18.420 --> 28:21.940]  They're actually usually pretty good at working with big established players
[28:22.180 --> 28:26.500]  They understand how to negotiate they understand how where leverage is and how to use it and things like that
[28:26.660 --> 28:31.700]  You know, we've seen that with the labels. We've seen that with when we sell it with the banks and so apple but again
[28:32.340 --> 28:34.340]  I think when you get a bunch of apple
[28:34.880 --> 28:39.380]  Executives and other companies executives in a room apple feels like they can control that situation. They do it
[28:39.380 --> 28:46.580]  Well where I think apple has really dropped the ball is in coming up with an effective means to
[28:47.300 --> 28:52.260]  Get retailers on board. Yes, they've gone to the big retailers and worked with them again directly
[28:52.580 --> 28:56.740]  But where's the where's the incentive program for small merchants to sign up?
[28:56.980 --> 29:00.340]  Where's the program to go and get information about apple pay and supporting in your store?
[29:00.660 --> 29:03.940]  Where's the program to get stickers for your door that says apple pay supported here?
[29:04.180 --> 29:08.680]  All that stuff is non-existent. I actually wrote about this in the daily update. I actually heard from multiple
[29:08.680 --> 29:12.280]  people who wanted to support apple pay because of the
[29:12.920 --> 29:20.360]  There was the liability shift last fall, which is a huge opportunity for apple to take advantage of and and they're like we we like
[29:20.840 --> 29:21.960]  We couldn't get a hold of apple
[29:21.960 --> 29:23.560]  There's nothing on the site about what to do
[29:23.560 --> 29:25.960]  Like we bought a new we bought a new payment processor
[29:26.040 --> 29:27.800]  None of them said if they supported apple pair or not
[29:27.800 --> 29:35.320]  So we didn't know so apple's not working with the manufacturers of these things and that's where apple falls down because there it's a you can't
[29:35.320 --> 29:40.280]  An apple representative can't go out and talk to every small and medium-sized business. They can't talk to every merchant
[29:40.600 --> 29:43.960]  They probably should talk to every manufacturer payment terminals, but they didn't apparently
[29:44.760 --> 29:49.480]  But but what you have to do is you have to create incentives you have to have like bonus programs
[29:49.560 --> 29:55.000]  You have to figure out ways so people can sign up seamlessly to integrate the rewards program or coupons or whatever it might be
[29:55.320 --> 29:58.600]  And that sort of stuff where it's it's self-serve
[29:59.720 --> 30:01.960]  Apple doesn't do a good job with that stuff
[30:01.960 --> 30:07.080]  And again, you can see that with the app store like it like this the people that apple deals with directly
[30:07.240 --> 30:09.240]  They do a good job and they partner well
[30:09.240 --> 30:12.920]  but when it comes to creating the conditions for success for
[30:13.480 --> 30:19.160]  People broadly that aren't necessarily going to ever talk to apple one-on-one the company doesn't do a good job
[30:19.320 --> 30:25.880]  and and I think that's why apple pay like there was this huge opportunity last year with this liability shift where basically what happened was
[30:25.880 --> 30:33.320]  uh, it if you didn't have a chip readable terminal and someone had a chip card you were liable for any fraud and
[30:33.640 --> 30:37.480]  Vice versa if you if you didn't have a chip card and they had a chip terminal then you were liable for fraud
[30:37.560 --> 30:42.200]  So so it was a that was a great example of how incentives drive change
[30:42.360 --> 30:44.360]  They couldn't force people to upgrade their terminals
[30:44.520 --> 30:50.360]  But they could say if you don't you're going to be held liable and so people would would pay themselves to to upgrade
[30:50.520 --> 30:54.920]  And apple should that was the hugest app for apple pay to be all over that and be advertising and say
[30:54.920 --> 31:00.680]  These chips suck. They take a long time to use they take like 60 seconds or 30 seconds or whatever to process
[31:01.080 --> 31:04.440]  This is the chance. Everyone's gonna buy new ones. Apple should have had a huge blitz
[31:04.440 --> 31:09.080]  They should have had marketing targeted at business owners and none of that happened. Absolutely none of it
[31:10.920 --> 31:16.760]  So you're saying even though the growth is great that it could have been it could be accelerated if apple were doing everything
[31:17.000 --> 31:21.880]  hugely accelerated right right because apple pay is not never going to reach its potential unless people have
[31:21.880 --> 31:26.980]  Confidence that it will mostly be okay the way actually this is a tie into the echo thing, right?
[31:26.980 --> 31:34.100]  the reason one reasons I like alexa much better than siri is i'm shocked when alexa doesn't work and i'm pleasantly
[31:34.740 --> 31:41.140]  pleased when when siri does like there's a there's a line that is like where you assume it's going to work and
[31:41.540 --> 31:43.540]  Apple pay is a long ways away from that line
[31:43.780 --> 31:49.220]  Like and what happens is even if you know mcdonald's accepts it or walgreens accepts it or whatever the places may be
[31:49.220 --> 31:54.100]  You're not in the habit at all of using it because no one wants to walk up and look like an I mean
[31:54.340 --> 31:56.340]  Some of us geeks will walk up do you support apple pay?
[31:56.660 --> 32:01.540]  uh, but normal people don't want to be in that awkward situation and so
[32:02.020 --> 32:07.060]  It's just frustrating because it's such a great product. It has so much potential because I mean, it's
[32:07.620 --> 32:10.100]  imagine apple owning your wallet like and
[32:10.660 --> 32:12.420]  it's
[32:12.420 --> 32:13.360]  What?
[32:13.360 --> 32:21.380]  Opportunities are out there if they really establish this and make it a very real thing. And again, that's my services criticism
[32:21.380 --> 32:25.860]  It's not that the stuff they do isn't as great as it could be. It's not frankly, but it's not that big a deal
[32:25.860 --> 32:29.660]  It's probably mostly fine. It's the opportunities that I believe they're missing
[32:33.220 --> 32:37.700]  I don't know about that, but it's an interesting argument. I don't know. I don't know
[32:37.700 --> 32:43.460]  Hey, I was I was appreciative that you didn't dismiss my proposal. All right, so I'll take what I can get
[32:45.780 --> 32:47.780]  What so
[32:47.860 --> 32:52.900]  What do you think who just said this there was some something I linked to this week
[32:54.180 --> 32:58.180]  Or somebody held up I message as a
[33:00.180 --> 33:02.180]  It might have been the the
[33:02.180 --> 33:08.500]  Kook, the kook I linked to said Tim Cook should be fired. Uh, which is cropped up again
[33:09.780 --> 33:16.580]  Yeah, I mean he's he's he's uh, he's a character to say the least. Wait, who was it? Oh left sits
[33:16.580 --> 33:18.580]  Yeah, that's it. Bob left us
[33:20.980 --> 33:22.980]  Held up I message as
[33:23.540 --> 33:29.860]  Like apple dropping the ball because they're keeping it proprietary and I and left sits is a kook and he's not a kook
[33:29.860 --> 33:33.780]  and I and left sits is a kook and he's not the only person who's said it but what
[33:34.420 --> 33:36.660]  to me I message is is a
[33:38.020 --> 33:40.020]  a very
[33:41.060 --> 33:42.500]  Under
[33:42.500 --> 33:45.700]  appreciated aspect of modern apple
[33:46.580 --> 33:50.260]  Because they don't in it and it it is to me
[33:51.060 --> 33:52.820]  almost a
[33:52.820 --> 33:54.820]  a pure apple
[33:54.820 --> 34:00.500]  Service because nobody else would ever do anything like this because it wouldn't make sense for anybody else to do it
[34:01.220 --> 34:03.220]  Is well except for black blackberry
[34:04.340 --> 34:08.980]  Yeah, I guess so. I guess so. I guess you're right. I guess it is sort of a copy of bbm
[34:09.860 --> 34:15.380]  That's that's that's fair, you know, but but that that's a testament to to the point
[34:15.860 --> 34:21.300]  And like that's like the tension here right because I message is a beautiful example of apple
[34:21.300 --> 34:25.380]  Having a vertical sort of model where their services differentiate their hardware
[34:25.540 --> 34:28.980]  Like I message is a reason to have and use an iphone
[34:29.140 --> 34:34.660]  like I tried to switch to android when my arm was broken because the speech recognition is so much better and one of the
[34:35.300 --> 34:40.340]  Things that made it very difficult was the lack of iMessage like it's a super great
[34:40.500 --> 34:43.780]  it's a it's a super great lock and it really is and
[34:44.500 --> 34:50.340]  Yeah, and so no that that's why this whole services thing is so fraught because
[34:50.340 --> 34:57.380]  to date it has been about differentiating apple's services and the question is in the long run like
[34:58.980 --> 35:00.980]  Is that is that enough
[35:01.060 --> 35:06.500]  Right, the thing that to me is underappreciated is that if you if you and I started a messaging service
[35:07.140 --> 35:12.580]  That that had only and exactly the features that I message has end-to-end encryption
[35:13.780 --> 35:17.940]  You you can put it's you can send text and you can
[35:17.940 --> 35:25.860]  Send text and you can embed images and that's it and we got as many users as I message has
[35:26.740 --> 35:28.740]  It would be a tremendously
[35:28.960 --> 35:31.860]  valuable company it it you know
[35:32.820 --> 35:38.740]  It's on the scale of like whatsapp and uh, what's the other one? Uh, you know them all?
[35:39.780 --> 35:44.100]  Uh line, we just call it right it's it or no
[35:44.100 --> 35:48.020]  no, it the number of you know in and whatever uh
[35:48.980 --> 35:56.180]  Buzzword metric you want to use like daily active users it it's huge iMessage is huge in terms of how many people
[35:56.820 --> 36:00.580]  Send or receive an iMessage every day. It would be tremendously valuable
[36:02.100 --> 36:08.180]  And it goes completely to me unrecognized in in people evaluating apple
[36:08.180 --> 36:14.260]  And maybe I don't think maybe it shouldn't maybe maybe it shouldn't because you know, the the other ways that people value apple
[36:14.900 --> 36:17.220]  There are intrinsically tied to iMessage
[36:17.860 --> 36:22.820]  Exactly because people value apple based on how many iPhones they sell and the way iMessage is
[36:23.460 --> 36:31.540]  leveraged by apple right now is as a tool to sell more iPhones and so it is properly valued like the only way it should
[36:31.540 --> 36:34.580]  Be valued separately is if apple
[36:34.580 --> 36:41.220]  Is if apple explicitly starts to think about it as as a service in its own right and maybe you could do that
[36:41.220 --> 36:44.900]  Well, well retaining it being only on on iPhones
[36:44.980 --> 36:51.220]  I mean you may have it maybe have less potential then but but no, I I don't think it is undervalued and people think oh
[36:51.620 --> 36:53.620]  They look at whatsapp's worth 18 billion
[36:53.700 --> 36:57.380]  I mean, how much is iMessage worth should that be added apples the bottom line the stock's unfair blah blah blah
[36:57.620 --> 36:59.620]  it's not because apple has
[36:59.620 --> 37:06.100]  Strategy is such that it is a part of the iphone and the iphone is valued very highly
[37:06.100 --> 37:08.500]  I mean apple is still the most valuable company in the world
[37:09.460 --> 37:16.500]  And it it leads me to what apple has invented as and to me a fairly as its own metric
[37:18.020 --> 37:23.540]  And I think it's only going back two or three quarters where they've started citing this number of
[37:23.540 --> 37:29.400]  Number of um, I don't know if they're calling it daily but actively used devices
[37:30.660 --> 37:36.740]  And they're say they're saying that they what I think it's a billion right a billion. Yep that there's a billion
[37:37.460 --> 37:39.940]  apple devices in active use
[37:40.580 --> 37:42.020]  Which isn't it?
[37:42.020 --> 37:46.980]  No other company maybe other than samsung samsung, I guess it would be an interesting
[37:47.460 --> 37:49.940]  I guess samsung could could act could use that
[37:49.940 --> 37:57.620]  Uh figure and it would be interesting too, especially considering that samsung has things like refrigerators and washing machines and microwave ovens
[37:58.340 --> 37:59.780]  No, seriously
[37:59.780 --> 38:02.580]  it no it's I I'm laughing because I first
[38:03.700 --> 38:05.620]  Sorry, it's just it's all a side side note, but
[38:07.700 --> 38:10.180]  The it's not even about samsung so I probably should even tell this story
[38:10.180 --> 38:14.020]  But now I feel like i've gotten myself too far in there there was during the nca tournament
[38:14.020 --> 38:18.180]  You know, you see the same commercial a million times. Yeah, and I think it was a couple of years ago
[38:18.180 --> 38:22.740]  There's a commercial for the lg smartphone like the optimus or prime or whatever it's called
[38:22.980 --> 38:28.660]  That's not the right name, but it's something like that and they would the commercial would be all about the phone
[38:29.140 --> 38:33.380]  At the very end. I think kenny smith was was the guy that was doing it. No, is it greg anthony?
[38:33.700 --> 38:37.720]  They would show him in front of the lineup of like washers and dryers and refrigerators
[38:38.260 --> 38:40.340]  Which the whole commercial was not about at all
[38:40.500 --> 38:45.060]  But they felt like that they felt the need to squeeze that into this ad they were paying a lot of money for
[38:45.060 --> 38:48.980]  And it cracked me off every single time. I saw it. I mean, it's like been three years. I'm still laughing about it
[38:48.980 --> 38:51.380]  Anyhow, sorry, that was totally totally off track
[38:52.340 --> 38:54.180]  Well now that I think about it though
[38:54.180 --> 38:56.660]  I I realized that there's a lot of companies, you know
[38:56.660 --> 39:02.820]  Sony and and lg any of those companies that I guess could cite a lot of quote-unquote devices
[39:03.140 --> 39:07.540]  I guess what makes apple's metric more interesting is that apple's devices are actually
[39:10.500 --> 39:14.100]  Things that you pay attention to you know, they're real computers is what they're for
[39:14.100 --> 39:16.100]  creators is what they're talking about
[39:16.420 --> 39:24.180]  It is and honestly apple talking about services and that their services company is totally legitimate because it is a it is a real
[39:24.900 --> 39:29.780]  one they make real money the vast majority of it is from the app store and most from pay-to-play games because
[39:30.740 --> 39:35.460]  You know, that's all that apple has enabled from a business model perspective, which i'm happy to rant and rave about
[39:35.940 --> 39:37.940]  but it is real money and
[39:37.940 --> 39:44.660]  And they're right and it is also real potential like if they actually did get serious about it
[39:45.140 --> 39:46.260]  like
[39:46.260 --> 39:51.060]  A you can do a lot with a billion devices and and that's the this is the other thing with the icloud thing
[39:51.300 --> 39:56.740]  The reason why I don't like focusing on icloud is because the implication of focusing on icloud is it should be on all devices
[39:56.740 --> 39:58.580]  You know like apple music is on android and stuff
[39:58.820 --> 40:02.820]  What what I think is the huge potential for apple is device specific services
[40:02.820 --> 40:09.060]  It is it is the things like apple pay. It is the things like home kit. It is the things like the watch like
[40:09.940 --> 40:14.500]  The watch the huge potential for the watch from my perspective is being the key to your life
[40:14.740 --> 40:19.380]  Like literally the key your watch should open your door your watch should oh should should start your car
[40:19.460 --> 40:22.820]  Your watch should be your badge at work. Like your watch should be this
[40:23.360 --> 40:30.020]  Moveable piece of identification that opera in apple like apple pay like the watch with apple pay is amazing
[40:30.020 --> 40:32.020]  It you just have to find a place that has apple pay
[40:33.380 --> 40:35.700]  You know, i've thought about that too
[40:36.420 --> 40:43.140]  That the the watch as your sort of key to your life and i've written about it too little way too little
[40:43.140 --> 40:47.220]  maybe even borderline not at all in terms of
[40:50.660 --> 40:56.260]  The big picture question of which i've sort of been writing about recently is why did they do the watch?
[40:56.260 --> 41:00.660]  Why did they do the watch, you know, why did they do the why did they release the watch when they did with the features?
[41:00.740 --> 41:02.020]  that it has
[41:02.020 --> 41:04.340]  um, you know should they have released a
[41:06.340 --> 41:11.620]  Obviously the watch is it's significantly flawed. It's the most flawed device. Apple is released in in
[41:12.260 --> 41:14.260]  In modern history in my opinion
[41:14.980 --> 41:17.540]  And I recently i've been writing either, you know
[41:17.540 --> 41:23.300]  I've paused it and with with that with that grouper just just just spawned a hundred articles, but continue
[41:23.300 --> 41:31.060]  Uh, i've posited though that apple should have either waited longer to release the watch so that it would have been faster
[41:31.220 --> 41:34.980]  and that some of the features that don't work well would have worked better or
[41:35.540 --> 41:39.940]  Cut those features that don't work well on the watch as we know it and released when they did
[41:41.780 --> 41:46.740]  But I do think lost in there is that one of the reasons that I think they wanted to get the watch out
[41:47.060 --> 41:49.380]  As you know sooner rather than later
[41:49.380 --> 41:56.820]  sooner rather than later it flaws though it had is that idea though of the watch in the long run being
[41:58.820 --> 42:03.620]  A sort of key to your life. I do. I do think there's tremendous potential there and i've thought about things like
[42:04.340 --> 42:05.540]  uh
[42:05.540 --> 42:10.340]  you know touch id is such an eye opener on on ios devices, but
[42:11.380 --> 42:18.180]  It's conspicuously absent on the mac and every time I have to type my password to unlock, you know, wake up my mac
[42:18.180 --> 42:22.980]  Uh, I think what a pain in the ass. This is every single time and why you know if you have your
[42:24.020 --> 42:29.060]  Well people watch on the it should be unlocked. Yeah, exactly and people a lot of it's like a frequently
[42:29.440 --> 42:35.620]  Emailed question to me is you know, like just with the recent update to the macbook one, uh
[42:36.820 --> 42:37.780]  that
[42:37.780 --> 42:38.500]  You know, hey
[42:38.500 --> 42:42.340]  How come they don't put a touch id sensor on the macbook because i'm so used to it on this
[42:42.740 --> 42:46.020]  And I tend to think that the answer isn't touch id for the mac
[42:46.020 --> 42:48.180]  I tend to think that the answer is like
[42:48.900 --> 42:50.660]  uh
[42:50.660 --> 42:57.380]  Some sort of way of if you if you've got the watch on and you're within a very very close distance
[42:57.460 --> 43:01.940]  You know like like three inches of the mac that it just unlocks
[43:03.300 --> 43:06.660]  There are actually apps you can get that do this and they do that with the phone as well
[43:06.980 --> 43:11.540]  Uh, but they're a little clunky as anything kind of third party is. Yeah, it has to be it has to be first party
[43:12.180 --> 43:14.180]  Yeah, I know
[43:14.180 --> 43:17.060]  And no the other thing with with the macbook is
[43:17.780 --> 43:23.940]  The touch id is is intimately integrated with the uh secure enclave on the on the a series chips
[43:24.260 --> 43:29.460]  So as long as there isn't an arm based mac, I don't think there's going to be touch id
[43:30.980 --> 43:37.780]  Yeah, that's it's probably true and I just I just tend to think that it's the wrong form factor and the fact that
[43:37.780 --> 43:43.460]  It it it kind of makes sense from it has to it should be to be do to be done right it has to be
[43:43.940 --> 43:49.620]  Platform-wide that any mac or at least new mac could do it but touch id
[43:50.820 --> 43:56.420]  To do it the exact same way would only work on macbooks because there's there's just no feasible way that
[43:57.140 --> 44:02.260]  That it well, I guess not no feasible way, but you'd have to have you know to have it work on the imax and
[44:02.980 --> 44:04.980]  Mac pros remember the mac pro
[44:04.980 --> 44:11.300]  Um, do they still make that you you would have to build it into the keyboard and it's
[44:12.260 --> 44:14.820]  You know and the idea that you could do it from the watch
[44:14.820 --> 44:17.700]  I guess if you could do it from the watch you could do it from the keyboard, you know
[44:17.700 --> 44:20.340]  that it would be some kind of secure way to do it wirelessly, but
[44:22.020 --> 44:24.980]  It just makes more sense to me that it would be the thing, you know
[44:25.700 --> 44:31.220]  And like you said like it should start your car. It could let you into your house if you have a smart door, you know
[44:31.220 --> 44:35.380]  It's there's so many ways that it could be done for that and it would be a tremendous like
[44:36.020 --> 44:39.940]  It would really like start to remove so many questions about why are they building?
[44:39.940 --> 44:43.540]  You know, why did they make a device that you can wear, you know on your wrist?
[44:44.260 --> 44:48.500]  No, I I completely agree and I mean this has been my vision for the watch kind of from the beginning
[44:48.500 --> 44:51.220]  I actually thought it might not even have a screen at the beginning because I was so
[44:51.620 --> 44:54.660]  Like to me this idea of being the key to your life and then notifications
[44:54.660 --> 44:57.860]  I mean the best feature of the watch is the taptic engine unless it fails
[44:57.860 --> 45:02.420]  But I mean, it's like that's what makes it really great. I was to wear regularly
[45:02.420 --> 45:07.060]  I would argue though that the taptic engine is the best in in theory
[45:07.060 --> 45:13.620]  It's the best feature but in practice it's not and and I think part of that is me being biased because I have
[45:14.340 --> 45:16.340]  My watch is a stainless steel one
[45:16.660 --> 45:22.260]  And I've yep, I'm sitting here and i've worn the aluminum ones enough and it's you know
[45:22.260 --> 45:29.780]  it's just the privilege of of getting review units, um and being able to try both because I realize most people why in the world would
[45:29.780 --> 45:34.180]  A normal person be able to wear both but I have an aluminum model here that I don't own
[45:34.180 --> 45:36.180]  It's you know, it's a review unit from apple
[45:36.420 --> 45:42.100]  But it's eye-opening after a while how much better the taptic engine is on the aluminum models than the steel ones
[45:42.980 --> 45:47.540]  And i've even worn i've tried it i've tried my son has the aluminum, you know
[45:47.540 --> 45:52.340]  The sport model too and i've worn his just for you know, like an hour or so. Um
[45:53.460 --> 45:57.860]  And just said like hey just send me a text every couple minutes, you know or send yourself a text
[45:57.860 --> 46:02.820]  You know because it was synced to his phone, but so I would feel it on my wrist and it feels so much better
[46:03.540 --> 46:07.060]  And it's you know, it's just how does it how does it feel on the edition john?
[46:07.700 --> 46:11.140]  I don't know. I actually i've i've never even tried an edition honestly
[46:11.700 --> 46:14.980]  Even even reviewers don't even get to try them, you know, I have noticed that
[46:14.980 --> 46:21.240]  Even reviewers don't even get to try them, you know, I have noticed though, uh the apple the apple store here in center city, philadelphia
[46:21.940 --> 46:29.140]  Uh used to be one of the stores that had the edition models in the display and you could buy the edition model here. Uh, and
[46:29.540 --> 46:30.500]  uh
[46:30.500 --> 46:32.660]  just last week amy and I were uh
[46:33.540 --> 46:34.500]  uh
[46:34.500 --> 46:35.700]  had a
[46:35.700 --> 46:38.580]  we're running errands in center city and we stopped into the apple store and
[46:39.380 --> 46:40.500]  um
[46:40.500 --> 46:42.500]  The addition models are gone
[46:42.500 --> 46:44.500]  in the philadelphia store
[46:44.500 --> 46:51.460]  Interesting. That is interesting. Yeah, I noted a while ago that uh that there seemed to quietly be
[46:52.340 --> 46:55.220]  emphasizing the addition less and less, uh
[46:55.860 --> 47:00.580]  And there was some pushback from a few people on twitter who were saying no they're not, you know, and it's still there
[47:00.580 --> 47:03.300]  It's just they're just putting in it. You know, they've just rearranged it
[47:03.300 --> 47:06.340]  It's not really less emphasis, but there's no doubt in my mind that they're
[47:07.540 --> 47:09.540]  Just quietly, you know
[47:09.540 --> 47:15.620]  You know, I know that quietly is often overused like finally when talking about apple, you know, apple quietly, you know
[47:15.620 --> 47:20.420]  Blah blah blah and it's you know, not really any less or more quiet than anything else
[47:20.980 --> 47:26.180]  It's just that they're not trumpeting it but the it's nowhere on i'm on the front page of the watch page
[47:26.180 --> 47:29.460]  And there is not an addition on here and there's like 15 watches on here
[47:30.260 --> 47:38.180]  No, it's just there but to me the way that they're backing away from uh, the addition model watches really is sort of a quiet like
[47:38.180 --> 47:40.820]  You know, let's start pretending like this doesn't exist
[47:42.020 --> 47:47.460]  And to me the new the new edition is the uh, Hermes
[47:48.740 --> 47:55.540]  Yep models of the watch. That's the the and you know, like the the stainless steel, um,
[47:56.340 --> 48:03.540]  Link bracelets, you know that the the luxury version of the watch are the ones that cost a thousand to two thousand not
[48:03.700 --> 48:05.700]  five to twenty thousand
[48:05.700 --> 48:07.700]  Twenty thousand
[48:08.580 --> 48:09.620]  Yeah
[48:09.620 --> 48:13.700]  It'll be interesting to if we look back on that edition
[48:14.260 --> 48:17.620]  Sort of series, uh, we had so much fun speculating about them how much they would cost
[48:18.500 --> 48:23.700]  I'm, pretty sure we did all five. Yeah the whole i'm i'm looking at the whole kind of nature. There's nothing about them at all
[48:24.740 --> 48:27.060]  yep, and uh and uh
[48:28.260 --> 48:32.660]  Yeah, if we'll look back at it sort of a a a kind of hubristic moment to be honest
[48:32.660 --> 48:36.740]  I mean, we're going to sell a a twenty thousand dollar watch because
[48:37.620 --> 48:40.100]  Because we can and we're and we're going to show it at these, you know
[48:40.500 --> 48:45.060]  fashion boutiques and all this sort of stuff and you know and to lots of people's credit there was a
[48:45.540 --> 48:48.500]  significant sector of of the sort of apple
[48:49.620 --> 48:50.660]  You know
[48:50.660 --> 48:54.180]  World that felt very uncomfortable with that
[48:54.180 --> 48:59.460]  Uh, you know more so than I did to be frank and and maybe there was something really to that
[48:59.460 --> 49:01.460]  Really to that
[49:01.620 --> 49:06.980]  Yeah, it's fascinating getting away from your your way we had this discussion. I think they like the whole andy warhol coke thing, right?
[49:07.060 --> 49:11.700]  Yeah, and yes the function of an edition was the same as the function of a sport
[49:12.260 --> 49:16.500]  But just the idea and because what may what makes the iphone so powerful?
[49:17.060 --> 49:20.100]  As a consumer product, there's lots of things about that make it powerful
[49:20.420 --> 49:25.220]  But the best phone in the world has an entry price of six hundred fifty dollars
[49:25.220 --> 49:32.580]  And while that is massively more expensive than the cheapest android you can get like 50 bucks on an absolute basis
[49:32.580 --> 49:37.940]  It's just not that much money and like and whereas cars you say oh the iphone is the bmw of cars
[49:37.940 --> 49:43.140]  Well, sure, but on an absolute basis a bmw is what minimum 35 000 if you want something, you know
[49:43.140 --> 49:49.540]  If you want a real bmw, it's it's it's a lot more than that. Like just absolute numbers matter and
[49:49.540 --> 49:55.780]  On an absolute basis. The iphone has never been that expensive on a percentage on a relative basis. Yes, it is. Absolutely expensive, but
[49:57.300 --> 50:01.540]  And that is something that's core to apple you can have the best phone in the world for
[50:02.260 --> 50:06.180]  Relatively to the grand scheme of luxury goods not that much money
[50:06.980 --> 50:13.140]  I forget what year it was, but it was probably the last year. I went to south by southwest and so that's probably
[50:13.700 --> 50:14.820]  like
[50:14.820 --> 50:22.100]  2010 or maybe it was even 2011 but somewhere around there the last year. I went to south by southwest in in austin
[50:22.820 --> 50:24.820]  and uh
[50:25.300 --> 50:32.260]  Me and jim kudol and michael lopp and uh a few other people went to dinner at
[50:33.780 --> 50:36.900]  At a steakhouse and as we were leaving
[50:37.860 --> 50:42.900]  We were like waiting in the the entry area, you know, like the sort of foyer of the the restaurant
[50:42.900 --> 50:48.660]  Um to leave and we saw by him standing by himself waiting
[50:48.660 --> 50:53.060]  I guess to go in it seemed it very soon seemed like he was waiting to to meet his party
[50:53.140 --> 50:57.400]  We saw michael dell and it was like holy shit. That's michael dell, you know, there's a billionaire
[50:58.100 --> 51:01.700]  And he was on his phone and I don't know what kind of phone he was using
[51:01.780 --> 51:06.500]  But the thought just popped into my head. He's a billionaire and I have a better phone than he does
[51:06.500 --> 51:10.660]  I don't it was such a weird thought. It was like, holy shit. There's michael dell
[51:11.700 --> 51:18.100]  Uh, wow, and then I because he was on his phone and it was clearly some sort of you know
[51:18.100 --> 51:20.660]  I don't know what I don't know if it was some kind of an iphone
[51:20.660 --> 51:24.740]  Yeah, it was not an iphone and I realized because it was not an iphone whatever it was
[51:24.980 --> 51:27.380]  He's a billionaire, but I have a better phone than he does
[51:28.900 --> 51:35.780]  And it was like such a weird thought and it is that sort of egalitarian thing that if you if you talk about it
[51:35.780 --> 51:40.980]  If you if you take the edition out of the apple watch lineup and just look at what they have without the edition
[51:41.300 --> 51:46.580]  It makes total sense to me as an apple product where it ranges from 299 to
[51:47.220 --> 51:49.220]  uh, I think the most expensive
[51:49.700 --> 51:54.020]  Is the ermes cuff which is i'm looking at 1500
[51:55.060 --> 52:00.740]  And take the cuff out and it's you know, I think it's like 1250 for one of the ermes models
[52:00.980 --> 52:05.060]  Um, and that makes total sense. The cheapest stainless steel is like 450 or something
[52:05.060 --> 52:07.620]  Yeah, and apple has always had kind of two levels in their lineups, right?
[52:07.620 --> 52:11.300]  They have the low end and the high end like and yeah, it does make much more sense
[52:12.020 --> 52:16.760]  But I really do think one of the fascinating, you know that the whole like some of the hand-wringing
[52:17.620 --> 52:23.300]  I I think the idea that the addition is folly and that it's a sign that the company is distracted has merit
[52:23.700 --> 52:27.220]  I think that the hand-wringing over the difference between
[52:27.940 --> 52:32.500]  The sport aluminum sport models and the stainless steel models though is misguided
[52:33.300 --> 52:34.260]  um
[52:34.260 --> 52:36.260]  because
[52:36.340 --> 52:38.340]  To me the range is reasonable
[52:38.420 --> 52:43.460]  But it's also fascinating to me that to me at a at a at a functional level
[52:43.540 --> 52:47.780]  The sport models are actually better because the taptic engine works better
[52:48.260 --> 52:54.340]  um, the the one thing that the stainless steel models have that the sport don't that is functionally better is that the
[52:54.980 --> 52:56.980]  the sapphire
[52:57.140 --> 53:01.940]  Cover for the display truly is scratch proof like mine
[53:01.940 --> 53:05.700]  I think and I think that I still think they look better too. They do look better
[53:05.780 --> 53:10.980]  I think so, too. I do but uh at a every other functional level because the uh,
[53:11.300 --> 53:14.900]  The taptic engine works better that the sport models is actually a you know
[53:15.060 --> 53:21.860]  It's superior and and so in in terms of like the speed of the cpu and the resolution of the display, etc
[53:21.860 --> 53:24.100]  Etc. It's all the same. It's exactly the same
[53:24.660 --> 53:28.100]  You don't get you you spend the extra money and all you're getting
[53:28.100 --> 53:31.380]  Is the what you can touch that the materials are better?
[53:32.420 --> 53:34.500]  So two observations one
[53:35.060 --> 53:37.060]  It's interesting that all the ermez
[53:37.700 --> 53:43.220]  Uh models are always stainless steel. There's no addition and two i've been clicking around this site for the last five minutes
[53:43.300 --> 53:48.580]  I cannot find the addition anywhere. Yeah, I honestly cannot find it on the website. Yeah, it's down the memory hole
[53:48.580 --> 53:51.460]  It's actually since I brought it up. It's actually been
[53:52.260 --> 53:54.260]  emphasized even less
[53:54.260 --> 54:00.820]  No, I oh there it is watch edition. You could only find it in the buy tab like in all the like product marketing tabs
[54:01.140 --> 54:08.500]  It's it's non-existent. It's completely not really gone. Right and I that makes me think I I would place a bet here today
[54:09.380 --> 54:14.260]  May 5th, uh that when we see apple watch 2.0. There is no edition model
[54:14.820 --> 54:20.100]  That it's right sport and I don't maybe they'll come up with a new name, but it's stainless steel and aluminum
[54:20.100 --> 54:22.980]  I think the addition thing is gone
[54:22.980 --> 54:25.860]  And I know for a fact I have heard from numerous
[54:26.340 --> 54:30.740]  At least several I wouldn't say numerous but several people within apple that there was
[54:31.780 --> 54:36.580]  Significant debate within the company at high levels as to whether addition
[54:37.140 --> 54:39.220]  should be a thing or not and that it was
[54:39.780 --> 54:46.260]  Johnny, iv and you know anybody who's under him maybe you know, I almost certainly mark newson
[54:46.260 --> 54:52.020]  Who pushed for it and that there were others within the company who were like this is you know, this is not a good idea
[54:52.020 --> 54:54.260]  You know, but it was more or less a johnny iv
[54:54.900 --> 55:00.740]  idea and that I think that oh, I mean obviously ultimately it came down to tim cook and I think
[55:01.460 --> 55:06.660]  Ultimately, and I don't know this this isn't you know, the the people who i've talked to don't you know
[55:06.660 --> 55:09.540]  Aren't the sort of people who would know what tim cook was thinking?
[55:09.540 --> 55:15.220]  But my my guess is that it wasn't that tim cook wasn't so much that tim cook thought it was a good idea
[55:15.860 --> 55:17.860]  In and of itself, but that tim cook
[55:18.420 --> 55:23.060]  Wanted to make johnny happy and that making johnny happy was doing this addition thing
[55:24.020 --> 55:26.020]  and and there's something so
[55:26.820 --> 55:33.700]  Telling about that and whether or not it may be right right but is this idea that apple is
[55:33.700 --> 55:41.700]  At the very top of the company still ruled by consensus and and the power of apple's organizational structure
[55:41.700 --> 55:46.740]  Which I wrote about is the way it kind of forces collaboration and groups have to depend on each other and there is
[55:47.300 --> 55:51.860]  No, no dictator, but that worked in part a lot of apple's organization was
[55:52.420 --> 55:58.340]  Steve jobs wanting to make an apple that could be his his instrument that he could be
[55:58.340 --> 56:04.340]  Steve jobs wanting to make an apple that could be his his instrument that he could play
[56:04.580 --> 56:10.660]  Right, like that would do his bidding and like there's the counterweight of the dictator at the top. That's that's
[56:11.300 --> 56:14.820]  The way I framed it is editor and I actually um, I I
[56:15.780 --> 56:18.420]  I think they still use it at apple university like I came up with it back back then like
[56:19.060 --> 56:23.060]  The best way to think about what jobs does at apple is he's the editor or what did at apple
[56:23.060 --> 56:28.100]  Uh was he's the editor in chief like he he didn't write the copy. He didn't
[56:28.660 --> 56:33.460]  Do the things he may have tweaked a headline to make it that much more gripping
[56:33.860 --> 56:38.900]  And he said no and he and he cut stuff and and he and he pushed stuff forward and he said oh
[56:38.980 --> 56:41.380]  well, you should go work on this sort of thing and
[56:43.380 --> 56:47.620]  For all the good things that tim cook has done and all the things that he's good at
[56:47.620 --> 56:52.660]  And to his credit, he knows he's not that person. He's not a product person
[56:52.900 --> 56:55.220]  So I think he's empowered johnny for sure
[56:55.460 --> 57:02.580]  but johnny johnny has a distinct set of skills that are not I don't think as broad as jobs were and
[57:03.140 --> 57:04.260]  and
[57:04.260 --> 57:07.220]  I don't know that he has the connection to
[57:08.500 --> 57:10.500]  and the empathy for the
[57:10.660 --> 57:14.660]  The kind of common man and you see this I think in some of the design decisions as well
[57:14.660 --> 57:18.900]  particularly when it comes to the user interface that that jobs did either and
[57:19.540 --> 57:22.500]  you know, you always hate to break out the you know,
[57:23.940 --> 57:25.700]  They miss steve sort of thing
[57:25.700 --> 57:27.780]  but when it comes to the watch and it comes to having
[57:28.100 --> 57:32.100]  The addition it comes to having these apps that were underpowered in this watch kit idea
[57:32.100 --> 57:38.440]  Which was a disaster like the watch should have if the watch was nothing but the display and notifications
[57:39.380 --> 57:43.860]  Like one it would be a great experience two. What's the criticism? Oh, it doesn't have apps
[57:43.860 --> 57:49.860]  Let's do that. Let's do that but implicit in that criticism is oh, but of course they're coming soon, right?
[57:50.020 --> 57:55.540]  Oh the iphone watch with all the apps too, right and it's such a different framing about the watch
[57:55.780 --> 57:58.340]  It's a framing of it's not what it is now
[57:58.340 --> 58:00.580]  But it has the potential to be like it's great now
[58:00.740 --> 58:05.700]  But it's going to be even better as opposed to it kind of sucks now and it might be better in the future
[58:05.860 --> 58:08.340]  Like just the tone of that is so fundamentally different
[58:10.500 --> 58:12.420]  Um
[58:12.420 --> 58:16.980]  We've you know, this is it's not just me, you know, but I feel like there's been a research
[58:16.980 --> 58:23.620]  I I think it's sort of the the roughly one, you know, the watch is one year old has sort of brought out a lot of
[58:25.140 --> 58:26.660]  You know
[58:26.660 --> 58:30.100]  Big picture. Hey, let's take a let's relook at apple watch
[58:30.740 --> 58:32.740]  um commentary
[58:32.740 --> 58:39.380]  and you know, i've certainly written a lot more about it recently than than I had for a while and
[58:40.260 --> 58:41.620]  um
[58:41.620 --> 58:47.540]  I'm with you. I really do think fund at a fundamental level that shipping with an sdk in an app store
[58:47.940 --> 58:53.220]  Was a mistake or maybe not an sdk but that the sdk should not have been about quote-unquote apps
[58:53.300 --> 58:55.300]  It should have been an sdk for
[58:55.840 --> 58:59.780]  Empowering, uh smart notifications, right or the key stuff, right?
[59:00.900 --> 59:02.340]  the what
[59:02.340 --> 59:07.060]  The key stuff like being the key to your wife. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I see what you mean
[59:07.140 --> 59:10.580]  I I somehow thought you were talking about like a keyboard or something. Yeah
[59:10.580 --> 59:14.980]  Yeah, um, but yeah, like the way that you there are apps like, uh,
[59:15.780 --> 59:21.160]  I have this great app. I use it. I've long used this great app on the iphone called do d-u-e
[59:23.220 --> 59:27.140]  That is a it to me it's way better than it
[59:27.780 --> 59:29.780]  It's a way to set reminders. Um
[59:30.260 --> 59:33.940]  Either one-time reminders like go pick up the dry cleaning at friday
[59:33.940 --> 59:40.100]  On friday at five o'clock or repeating reminders like every wednesday at 10 o'clock
[59:40.180 --> 59:43.540]  I have a do reminder that tells me to take the trash out
[59:44.100 --> 59:49.700]  um that works better for me than either putting them on my calendar or
[59:50.420 --> 59:56.740]  Using like the clock app or something like that because they're out of the way. I don't want these things. I don't want my calendar
[59:57.300 --> 01:00:02.020]  To say take out the trash every day at 10 o'clock. I want my calendar to just tell me things that are actually
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:04.900]  Uh novel so do is a great app for that and the watch
[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:10.900]  Integration with do is great. But because it lets me do things like you can um
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:18.020]  Do let you snooze things and so you can snooze by like one hour
[01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:20.660]  Three hours or a whole day
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:24.820]  And they're just buttons. So you just scroll down on the apple watch and it'll be like
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:30.420]  You know market is done because you've done it or snooze for an hour three hours a day
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:35.460]  Great, that's and and it's a total like notification. It's not really an app. It doesn't launch an app
[01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:40.660]  It's just that the notification is smart in that way. So that sort of sdk definitely the apple
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:44.420]  It's it's integral for what the apple watch is actually good for
[01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:50.740]  So I don't want to say no sdk, but definitely it should not I I really feel firmly that it should not have apps
[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:55.460]  Because the apps are it's such a bad experience every aspect of it from the beginning to the end
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:01:00.660]  From launch actually just launching the app on that honeycomb screen all the way to the end of
[01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:05.220]  Using the app is a bad experience and I really think it shouldn't have had it
[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:13.940]  And when to take this kind of full circle, uh, the problem with do is uh, there's you can't integrate it with siri
[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:20.500]  Yeah, yeah, like the in which is siri one of the things I do use siri for regularly is to do reminder things
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:25.700]  Particularly when i'm driving. I always think so when i'm driving and I find it very very helpful very helpful then but
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:28.500]  We're what four five years on now
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:35.860]  Yeah, five years on and there is no sdk for siri and meanwhile you have amazon to go the echo thing
[01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:42.740]  Where the sdk is going spreading like wildfire wildfire and are there in are there?
[01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:49.140]  In some respects it gets this whole tension is the amazon kind of vernacular more willing to do that
[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:54.420]  So it's kind of vernacular more limited. Yes, you have to kind of train yourself and you have to use the right language, right?
[01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:59.380]  but but that also imparts a degree of flexibility and
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:05.540]  An experimentation and easy to plug into in this that is really works to its credit
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:09.860]  amila apple is trying to perfect this natural language interface and have a have a
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:16.820]  an assistant that makes jokes to you that make you want to throw your phone in the ocean when it makes a joke because it
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:23.380]  Said four times in a row and it and it's just like hold it. Let's let's stop stop. So I want to get onto this
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:27.220]  Stop stop. I was getting worked up
[01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:32.980]  All right, okay, i'm about to scotch do it do an ad I need to go I need to go get another four
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:40.020]  Let's unwork you up and talk about one of my favorite long-time sponsors of the show is automatic
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:46.280]  Automatic is the connected car company that improves your driving and integrates your car into your digital life
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.960]  You want to go to automatic.com?
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:54.600]  Slash the talk show and use the code the talk show you'll get a 20% off your purchase. What is it?
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:59.400]  it's it's this little dingus that it's like almost like a USB stick and
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:05.560]  Every car made since I think like 1996 1997
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:10.920]  1997 it goes back a while has this same standard diagnostic port and
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:17.240]  Automatic.com they'll they'll help you find it on your car. But in other words, it's like when your car says like
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:22.120]  Service get service code a4 or something like that
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.760]  And you don't know what that means. Well
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.240]  when you go to the
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:31.440]  Mechanic you go to the the car service place they plug into this
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:36.960]  Diagnostic port and that's where they figure out what it is that the car actually needs automatic
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:39.840]  you can plug you plug automatic into this exact same port and
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:44.800]  It reads all that stuff and it gets every single car
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:49.560]  It's really this it's a I had no idea until they started sponsoring the show that this port
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:55.800]  Existed and that it was cross-platform across all makes and models of cars. It tells you everything it needs to know it knows
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:59.620]  It can it can tell you things about your fuel economy
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:07.220]  It can tell you exactly when there is an error or some sort of services do exactly what service that means so you can know
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:09.620]  Like hey, this is actually important
[01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:13.000]  You better go get service right away, or this is the sort of thing like yeah
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.620]  I better get this looked at soon, but I can wait a week or two if I need to
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:23.500]  You know, but it tells you all sorts of things tells you whether the way that you're driving is maximizing your fuel efficiency or not
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:29.740]  and they have what they call that, you know an app store and it
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:33.500]  Lets you integrate your car and you're driving
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:41.300]  With all sorts of things. It really is the the the internet of things that connected life
[01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:44.520]  Brought real because you can integrate with things like nest
[01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:51.620]  Your mechanic fresh books and more so you could do things like you can set it up
[01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:57.300]  I mean this really is like the future made real you can have things like once you're within
[01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:02.380]  X miles of your house have your nest thermostat
[01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:09.420]  Change the temperature in your house, you know in this right now it's May so we're heading more towards air conditioning
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:12.100]  So you turn on the air conditioning and lower the temperature in the winter?
[01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:15.060]  You can have it turn on the heat and and raise the temperature
[01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:21.380]  Really it works. It is amazing and it even works with IFTTT if this then that
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:28.660]  Which it literally makes almost unlimited possibilities of the ways that you can integrate this with your life
[01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:31.740]  It's
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:36.260]  It is useful and it is it trust me. It is actually fun
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:41.140]  It is really cool to have a car that can do stuff like this and just to get that information
[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:46.020]  Even just even if it didn't integrate with other devices or something like that. It's actually really cool
[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:48.980]  Just to get the information
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:52.540]  It's totally private automatic doesn't sell your data
[01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:59.020]  It's all they want you to do is just buy the gadget and there's no monthly fees. No subscription. So
[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:03.740]  Normally, the automatic dingus is $99
[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:05.860]  but
[01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:11.820]  But with you go through this URL go to automatic comm slash the talk show and remember the code
[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:15.860]  The talk show and you'll save 20% that's 20 bucks
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:21.620]  So for just 80 bucks, you can get this thing that makes your car the car you already have
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:27.580]  Way cooler so go to automatic comm slash the talk show and buy this thing. Trust me
[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:33.660]  I don't think there's ever been anybody who's done this who's bought this automatic and who regrets it. It's totally cool
[01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:36.380]  One of my favorite sponsors so my thanks to them
[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:43.860]  So you got your license back, yeah, well I drive it I've been lucky
[01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:48.420]  You know the vast majority of listeners, I think still don't think you have a license
[01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:55.420]  That's like that's like that's an ancient joke at this point I think
[01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:59.700]  Well the longtime listeners will enjoy it
[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:02.820]  What happened is I lost my license a few years ago for driving too fast
[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:06.260]  Allegedly
[01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:14.980]  It adds it adds to the myth let's talk about Apple's
[01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:20.060]  Quarter before we get too far because I feel like we've you know, so Apple
[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:23.500]  Ten days ago or so announced their
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:29.140]  Finite, you know the January to March quarter, which is for them in their calendar year q2
[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:32.940]  And it was
[01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:40.700]  bad for Apple because in so far is it was the first time in 13 years that they had a
[01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:42.700]  year-over-year
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:44.700]  decline in revenue and profit
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:49.380]  Which is an extraordinary streak, but obviously, you know
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:55.700]  Even if you even if you you know subscribe to the you know had to happen eventually which I think is, you know
[01:07:55.700 --> 01:08:00.420]  Totally true. It's you know impossible to for a streak like that to go in forever
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:06.100]  It's extraordinary. It's an it wasn't an extraordinary run, but you know it obviously
[01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:10.420]  Even if it was inevitable, it can't be seen as anything other than bad news
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:14.660]  Well
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:16.660]  It's okay and so
[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:18.740]  It's okay. And so
[01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:25.220]  It was expected in some respects and actually last quarter in the first like the the first quarter
[01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:27.180]  Where people were kind of banging them?
[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:31.540]  I was still pretty optimistic and I thought it was a pretty good quarter and and my
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:35.940]  Contention was actually the same thing that that you just wrote last week
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:42.540]  Was that well if you I charted out if you took their results from 20 2008 2014
[01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:48.700]  and you took it on an annual basis because you know, they they shifted when the iPhone was sold was launched and they
[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:53.860]  Like there's lots of you couldn't do it on a quarter by quarter basis because stuff has changed
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:56.900]  but if you put that on a graph and then
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:01.620]  forecasted forward what the expectations would have been for
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:06.220]  2015 and 2016 they were actually right on track
[01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:10.700]  And they were growing nicely. It just happened. They picked up like a free
[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:13.340]  50 million users in in 2015
[01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:19.260]  I can't let's take a step back though and just emphasize that that what we're talking about here
[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:22.900]  Is that because two-thirds of Apple's revenue comes from the iPhone?
[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:27.380]  Fundamentally right now and and for the foreseeable future
[01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:30.700]  as the iPhone goes so goes Apple as a whole and
[01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:36.740]  What I was the graph you're talking about was specifically it wasn't about Apple as a whole. It was specifically iPhone sales
[01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:43.180]  Right, exactly. Yeah. No, you're right. I'm talking about iPhone sales and and just it's two-thirds. It's two-thirds. It's it's just
[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:51.180]  It's a room. It's just an enormous as big as iPad and Mac and services and and watch and everything else
[01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:54.020]  Apple does which would still leave them as an enormous and
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:58.100]  Arguably, it might even still be the most
[01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:00.380]  What's one-third?
[01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:05.620]  Yeah, they'd still be close to the most profitable company in tech or at least they'd be in the ballpark
[01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:11.980]  Without the or in profits because the iPhone is also the the iPhone has significantly higher margins in their products as well
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:17.780]  So it's it's a two-thirds of revenue, but it's like three-quarters of profit. So it's yeah, all right, absolutely
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:24.340]  But so fundamentally though as goes the iPhone so goes Apple and it's the I the decline in iPhone sales
[01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:27.060]  Correlates directly to the decline and everything else
[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:29.100]  Right, right
[01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:35.180]  and so so I came out of the first quarter pretty optimistic and then this quarter came along and
[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:36.700]  I
[01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:37.900]  frankly
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:45.420]  Completely changed my view like I think that we got a lot more information this quarter about lots of things that frankly
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:51.740]  Discredited a lot of the things that Apple itself told us in previous quarters and
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:59.980]  cast a lot of doubt on the on the iPhone and and I actually think that the situation is worse than
[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:05.740]  Then then then you wrote last week, for example, I think there is genuine reason for concern and just to be super duper clear
[01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:13.180]  The iPhones not going anywhere like this is a discussion about like the growth prospects of the iPhone
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:18.220]  Which to your point are about the growth prospects of Apple which by extension are about the stock
[01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:22.380]  The stock is about the future growth opportunities. The stock is not it's not a scorecard
[01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:25.620]  it's not it's not a scoreboard about what we've done in the past and I
[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:31.340]  Now have very serious like I wrote a thing this week in the daily update like I kind of went through like one
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:37.980]  There's a data point that is different than I thought it was and there are three assumptions that I had about the iPhone business
[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:44.380]  Before that I have now changed my assumptions about and that makes and as a whole it makes me much more bearish
[01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:48.220]  There's an interesting point and you're the one who pointed it out to me not not publicly
[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:52.500]  I don't think until now on this show, but and when I wrote I took the
[01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:58.580]  The stance last week in my the written piece that I'm doing fireball that
[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:05.420]  What Apple announced for q2 was exactly what they had forecast in q1 and therefore?
[01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:07.740]  whether you think this is
[01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:14.180]  However, bad or okay you think this is it shouldn't have resulted in a jolt in the stock
[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:17.100]  But the stock jolted badly downward
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:24.260]  Six or seven percent which was for Apple is about like it was something like forty billion dollars in market cap just poof and
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:29.940]  You pointed out that that's not true like for q2. Yes
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:33.580]  They were what they announced was exactly within the guidance from three months ago
[01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:36.740]  But you pointed out and I completely missed this that
[01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:45.980]  The the part that was the same as the one that was the one that was the one that was the one that was the one that was
[01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:51.940]  The part that was a surprise or was unexpected or quite frankly contrary to what Apple had said before
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:58.660]  Was what they're now guiding for q3 which is that q3 this current quarter
[01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:03.020]  April to June is actually going to be the worst of it and
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:08.100]  Where that's contrary and people you know and I I've I think I tweeted about it
[01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:13.700]  I didn't write about entering fire bulbs people are like no they'd never guide more than one quarter in advance
[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:18.180]  So they you know, that's not true that they that they misguided on q3
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:21.580]  but they did indirectly because they said in
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:27.380]  January and their quarterly results. We think that this upcoming q2 will be the worst
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:35.540]  And now they're saying and that now they're saying actually q3 is gonna be the worst and that's that's a huge thing
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:38.340]  that's actually that is significant and it's it's
[01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:41.100]  It's worrisome
[01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:46.940]  It's it's worse in two ways. So the first reason so the next cute core is gonna be worse
[01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:53.660]  The first reason is gonna be worse is they're taking they're basically saying they're gonna run down inventory to the tune of two two billion dollars
[01:13:53.660 --> 01:14:00.460]  And what that means and they're there contrary to what people there's kind of a thing a few years ago about ship versus sold
[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:07.220]  Apple and every other manufacturer calculates based on ships not on sold because it's just impossible for them to know
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:11.620]  Except for Apple stores, which only sell actually a relatively small fraction of iPhones
[01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:16.220]  There's no way for them to know when it's sold and so it is calculated on ship versus sold
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:21.980]  and if you look at their financial reports, you can see like their inventory and what's in the channel all that sort of stuff and
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:27.380]  Basically over the last two quarters. They've been significantly increasing inventory
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:34.220]  the only reason they were up in the first quarter was because they ran up inventory and
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:41.300]  the only reason they met their guidance in the second quarter was because of the inventory thing as well and so and so now they're
[01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:46.460]  Saying oh a third quarter. We're gonna have to run this inventory down. So we're they guided way lower the advantages
[01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:51.060]  They're gonna meet their guidance again, right? But had they played the inventory game
[01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:54.040]  Fairly to put it to for lack of a better word
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:57.920]  They would have missed last quarter and they would have missed in the first quarter as well
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:02.180]  and and so so one like they actually if they were
[01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:06.200]  Running their business as they've traditionally run it
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:11.900]  This would actually be the second miss in a row instead of being the second barely make make making guidance
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:15.380]  That's one but then two and so so you can say and it's easy
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:17.600]  I would just back up keep your number two
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:22.340]  But I would just back up and say that Apple had under the in the Tim Cook era and that's not just Tim
[01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:25.240]  Cook is CEO, but CEO. Oh, he's there
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:32.500]  They're so operationally efficient that the ship versus sold thing was easy for us Apple people to mock other
[01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:37.820]  Makers for because with Apple it was it has for for any device has largely been
[01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:42.280]  The relevant because they're so operationally efficient that what they ship is what they sell
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:47.980]  Exactly. So it was it was actually a fair criticism even if like on a technical basis
[01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:51.560]  It wasn't quite right like the implication of the criticism is actually totally fair
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:56.320]  You're exactly right tend to keep inventory so low and that they really do, you know
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:58.220]  Whatever they make is what they're selling, you know
[01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:02.020]  They and they they make what they sell and they sell what they make but this in this case
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:06.660]  They've obviously made you know, they they got ahead of themselves in manufacturing
[01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:12.980]  They they did so and so so one there the q3 is gonna be worse because of the two billion
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:20.900]  But if here's what's here's what's really concerning even if you take out that two billion the q3 is still going to be worse
[01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:25.560]  And which means like when they said that and they said that at the end of January
[01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:28.960]  Which means they're a month into the current quarter
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:35.700]  They said that oh, we think the next quarter is gonna be the worst quarter and it turns out like they were wrong like
[01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:44.140]  It they don't know what's happening with the iPhone frankly, right? You haven't seen Apple been be this this
[01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:50.220]  Unaccurate and and that's just this quarter. I mean I
[01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:56.180]  We can get to their earnings calls last year, which are actually for me personally are even more
[01:16:56.860 --> 01:16:59.900]  Concerning in some respects. Yeah, you wrote about that recently. I
[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:02.620]  did in in I
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:04.900]  like so I so
[01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:07.260]  Paraphrase, let me paraphrase
[01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:11.340]  Maybe I can do a better job paraphrasing than then you can because you wrote the piece but
[01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:15.660]  paraphrasing and then you can correct me or clarify but
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:18.980]  Basically zoom out big picture
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:25.340]  What we're seeing is that the iPhone 6 last year was and not
[01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:29.820]  Anomaly in terms of its popularity. It was off the curve and
[01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:35.460]  I think I think that the reason was twofold
[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:39.380]  I think it was that that was when they hit what's the carrier in China?
[01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:42.100]  China mobile China mobile and
[01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:51.300]  It was pent-up demand for larger iPhones and with the long rumors
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:57.340]  you know the year-long rumor that hey Apple's next iPhone is actually gonna be have they're gonna have a bigger screen version and
[01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:03.780]  Anybody who was maybe leaning towards upgrading or getting an iPhone was like well
[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:09.140]  I'll wait for that bigger screen one because I want a bigger screen and that there was so much pent-up demand for that that it
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:10.500]  that it
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.500]  was an anomalously
[01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:15.860]  Popular
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:22.660]  But if you look back a year at what Tim Cook said on quarterly these quarterly
[01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:26.220]  Analyst calls he downplayed that it was you know
[01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:32.000]  He more or less made it sound as though this was what he expected and that this was the growth that they you know
[01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:35.180]  This was organic growth. It wasn't anomalous growth
[01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:41.540]  Exactly. He was pressed on every single. Well, so far the first two earnings call he volunteered that
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:43.520]  Oh, there's tons of people that haven't upgraded yet
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:49.480]  We have tons of greenfield and and by the q3 and q4 the analysts were getting a little a little skeptical of this
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:55.660]  Especially Tony second Agua who asked really good questions every every call and he's been a great skeptic all along
[01:18:55.660 --> 01:19:00.620]  And he was pressing cook on this like look you you're so you're are you sure that?
[01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:08.500]  you're not not just the the delayed 5s upgrades but also pulling forward upgrades where people are upgrading early be just because they wanted to
[01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:13.500]  Get the big-screen phone. He's like, are you sure that you're in Tim Cook four times a row?
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:17.860]  And I quoted all four times in in my update like he said oh no
[01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:19.860]  like we think there's tons of
[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:26.500]  opportunity here only this fraction is upgraded blah blah blah and and it was and the reason I mean
[01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:29.380]  I'm personally frustrated like I know you we've talked to this
[01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:31.380]  one-on-one like
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:36.860]  the only thing worse than being wrong is letting something that you said that was wrong like persist out there and so like you want to
[01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:38.220]  Correct it and make clear what it is
[01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:43.940]  and I wrote a piece last fall like saying stop doubting the iPhone and one of my core things was that
[01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:47.420]  This upgrade point because I believed cook
[01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:52.300]  I believed him when he said that we're not seeing an upgrade rate out of the ordinary and there's a there's a ton of
[01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:55.900]  Opportunity and for him to come back on this call and to say oh well
[01:19:55.900 --> 01:20:00.860]  There was a massive upgrade cycle last year and obviously as you would expect to be slower this year. It was I
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:04.480]  mean, I don't know the right word for it because
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:10.340]  It's in the record. He he's changed his tune and and Tony
[01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:17.340]  Called him out on the call and cook actually got a little annoyed had it which was in really interesting because Tony had him dead
[01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:21.460]  to rights because he was the same one that was asking the questions last year and I
[01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:26.060]  I I don't think cook was doing anything on purpose. I because that would be stupid
[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:30.580]  it'd be super for fusions one because you get in trouble to because
[01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:35.600]  Cook if cook did on purpose. He was setting Apple up for a fall like apples
[01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:42.620]  No one people in the vestment community don't believe Tim Cook right now like with because he's
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:49.620]  Changed exactly what he's saying. And so he's hurt his credibility. I just kind of think that Apple
[01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:55.460]  Didn't didn't know like they they didn't they didn't really do the research on upgrades and I suspect
[01:20:55.780 --> 01:21:00.500]  Before this quarters called like how do we explain this and they sent some intern to sit to like figure out?
[01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:05.140]  What are the upgrade rates in previous cycles? How does that compare to this cycle? And they're like, oh crap
[01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:09.140]  we were saying the wrong thing last year actually was wildly out of the ordinary and
[01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:15.900]  And we have much slower upgrade rates as a result this year and and that's how that kind of played out. Yeah
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:18.860]  I think
[01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:24.780]  I think you knew called it out in one of your daily updates was that it was I
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:28.500]  How do you pronounce his name Tony?
[01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:31.340]  Saka Saka Saka Nali or something
[01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:35.260]  I was so annoyed because I was listening to call because I I sleep through it
[01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:41.500]  During the night here and so I woke up and as soon as cook said that like my radar went up because I remembered it
[01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:43.700]  Was I'm like and I'm like cook was like I don't recall
[01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:50.260]  Sure before that no cuz cook in cooks opening remarks. He said, oh this upgrade cycle blah blah blah in a meal
[01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:53.620]  I'm like, that's the key of my daily update. I'm gonna nail him on his flight because
[01:21:54.140 --> 01:22:00.580]  That's wrong. And then Tony asked the question. I'm like damn you Tony. You just stole my thunder, right? So so
[01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:06.060]  Twofold basically and again if I'm summarizing this wrong
[01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:09.100]  Tell me but twofold one
[01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:14.700]  It seems like Apple misinterpreted a year ago Apple misinterpreted the successes
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:21.060]  Success or sixes success the iPhone the original iPhone 6 and 6 plus the it misinterpreted their
[01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:25.500]  Success as being part of the
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:34.020]  Growth of iPhone in general as opposed to being exceptional out of line with the expected growth
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:41.100]  They they thought hey, this is you know, this is part of the growth curve. But the truth was it was outside the growth curve
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:45.700]  They missed that and then this year they are clearly overestimated
[01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:48.460]  the success
[01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:53.600]  I think basically for the same reasons that because they thought the six was normal
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:57.340]  They thought the success was going to continue on that path and it did not
[01:22:57.340 --> 01:23:05.800]  Well, I think they knew the six was out of whack, but I think they attributed it mostly to being them acquiring new customers as opposed to
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:10.880]  Pulled for do as opposed to pull forward upgrades one thing that's really interesting
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:14.120]  And this is this is if you want to have a bull case for Apple today
[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:18.160]  This is probably the one to take is if you invert
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:21.360]  2015 and 2016
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:24.600]  That linear line I talked about actually continues
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:30.500]  Hmm why cuz right now Apple's probably gonna come in with about 200 million iPhones, but 210 million or so
[01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:33.020]  for two for fiscal year 2016 and
[01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:38.540]  And this is another thing that that that changed Apple didn't say but they hinted that
[01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:44.720]  2016 would be about the same as 2015 2015 was 230 million and so it seemed like oh they have this nice boost along the
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:47.380]  Way, but but that's clearly not happening one
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:51.820]  but two if you invert that and you pretend that 2015 was
[01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:53.820]  two hundred and five million and
[01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:56.220]  2016 was two hundred and thirty million that
[01:23:56.420 --> 01:24:04.020]  actual that will that line is almost perfectly linear like it's an r-squared of 0.98 like it's incredibly like straight on and you could say
[01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:10.300]  Oh, they just got all the two hundred and sixteen buyers. Just all bought a year early and
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:16.860]  2017 is gonna revert back to normal like if that is I think the bull case to make for for
[01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:24.100]  For 2017 in the iPhone 7 I don't buy it, but that that is that is the bull case
[01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:28.700]  And I can tell you why I don't buy it if you don't want
[01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:34.660]  Well, tell me tell me why you don't buy it. I don't really the reason I'll tell you why I don't buy it
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:41.380]  Let me let me let me go first you go first. I think that the extraordinary growth of the iPhone was fueled by
[01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:48.180]  By adding new carriers around the world and they've already added
[01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:52.780]  Most of the carriers that there's there's no big pickings left
[01:24:53.780 --> 01:25:01.620]  And yep. Yeah, that's 100 it that's 100% it like they they they like I actually tried to research this and I spent I remember I
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:02.500]  spent
[01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:04.620]  Days on this and it was so hard to figure out
[01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:07.340]  I need to hire an intern to to like try to figure this out and try to
[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:12.740]  Measure what when they went into new carriers in new countries and how that contributed iPhone growth
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:17.860]  But one thing that was always so striking about Apple for years is how accurate their forecasts were, right?
[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:22.340]  They would miss on the high side, but they'd miss on the high side by the exact same percentage every single time, right?
[01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:25.060]  Right, it was uncanny and then they said oh from now on
[01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:31.060]  We're actually gonna make sure be more concerned or we're gonna make our guidance actually accurate and then they were accurate by the exact same
[01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:35.620]  Amount every time and I wonder how much of that was they knew which carriers were coming online
[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:39.300]  They knew which countries were coming online and they knew because they've done this a bunch of times
[01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:44.740]  We're gonna get this carrier has has has a certain number of customers. We're gonna get a certain percent of those customers
[01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:47.780]  We know that's gonna happen and they actually built this into contracts
[01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:53.980]  right carriers had to had to guarantee a certain number of subscribers and and so they a
[01:25:54.460 --> 01:26:00.120]  huge factor in iPhone growth was just increasing the available market of the iPhone and once you
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:06.840]  Got the last one the wet like that in there was Verizon there's NT Docomo and a bunch of small ones in general
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:13.560]  but the last the big one was China Mobile and China Mobile came on in 2014 and then the iPhone 6 launched and
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:18.600]  And that was the last one and now that is gone
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:23.840]  And the question for growth for the iPhone 7 is not just getting people to upgrade
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:27.400]  Because there's lots of evidence that that's extending and we can talk about that as well
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:31.560]  But where's the new users going to come from right? Yes, people are switching
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:35.300]  I do think they're switching and I think the iPhone will get growth from switchers
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:41.200]  But that's countered by the upgrade cycle being elongated for two reasons one
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:45.000]  iPhones are just getting better and better and and to
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:52.720]  the bigger Apple gets the more they get away the more they get into like the mainstream and people that just aren't that concerned with
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:55.040]  Performance like us geeks are gonna upgrade all the time
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:58.540]  but but the farther away they get from us the
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:05.160]  The less likely it is that they're going to upgrade and you combine that with with carriers moving to these these plans
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:11.780]  Where once your phone's paid off your bill actually goes down like there's I'm skeptical where the new user is gonna come from
[01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:17.860]  Yeah, it's it's crazy if you think about it. I mean it was only January 2011
[01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:23.560]  I mean that's four years into the iPhone that it was available on a second carrier in the u.s.
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:30.460]  Which is Verizon. I mean, it's yep. It took a long time to spread it. You know, there there was so much
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:35.440]  Potential and that if you look at the absolutely
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:41.400]  Explosive growth. I mean I forget which iPhone but it was well into the iPhone 4 era
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:45.600]  Maybe even the 4s where it was the 4s that was like blew everyone's mind
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:49.880]  But it wasn't just that each iPhone outsold its predecessor
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:54.820]  It was that each iPhone outsold all of its predecessors combined, right?
[01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:59.820]  Right it well into like the fourth fifth maybe even the sixth iPhone
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:02.040]  generation
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:09.880]  Outsold all of the previous iPhones combined and the one before it outsold all of its previous ones combined it the the
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:14.560]  The slope on the growth curve. It's it's just phenomenal
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:20.960]  It's almost incomprehensible, but it was fueled largely by yes, lots and lots of people wanted iPhones
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:25.200]  Once they you know a year or two in and they understood what it was
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:29.480]  But they couldn't get it or thought they couldn't get it because they didn't want to switch carriers
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:35.140]  Or it wasn't or it literally wasn't even available in their country yet on any carrier, even if they were willing to switch
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:42.280]  Yeah, and this this is such a this is such a danger zone for companies where you kind of
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:46.800]  misattribute your success and the iPhone just grew for so long and
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:52.520]  it's easy for even someone as smart as Tim Cook and his executive team to
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:59.920]  To just assume that's gonna go on forever and to discount like structural changes in the market where you're you're changing
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:03.900]  like if you if the iPhone will always have X percent of the market if you
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:09.520]  there's two functions like you can either increase that the percentage of the market or you can change the market size and
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:16.680]  For years Apple was changing the market size slowly and steadily and in some respects
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:17.840]  That's why that you could argue
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:23.720]  That's why the growth went on for so long unlike someone like Samsung like Samsung's great strength has always been drawn
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:27.000]  every single carrier in every single market and they have
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:29.440]  They have this massive distribution network
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:35.560]  And that's why they just came out of nowhere to dominate Android because they had this network built in right and it's like they come
[01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:41.060]  And they're like they come to Verizon and they're like we want you to carry this and Verizon says something like, okay
[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:43.920]  We'll do it, but we want to put our own custom skin on the UI
[01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:48.160]  Samsung just sounds like go ahead. So I was like you got it, too
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.260]  Like it's like they just stick out their hand for the handshake like you got it
[01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:58.000]  No people diss them especially in Apple world, but like there's something
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:05.100]  Admirable that like it's a totally valid strategy and it and the people of course pants on like kind of came crashing down to earth
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:07.320]  Which you know was predictable
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:14.680]  But don't discount the fact they made billions and billions and billions of dollars along the way, right? I you know, I I
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:19.200]  I agree, I do that there and and to me there is something
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:26.440]  there's obviously something different about Samsung compared to all the other Android handset makers in the way that you know that
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:28.440]  It
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:30.080]  In
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:31.920]  in a normal
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:39.160]  Market all those very if you if you take or let's just take Samsung out take Samsung out and all of a sudden the entire
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:46.600]  Android market is more or less indistinguishable. I mean, there's you know, obviously some sell more than others, but there's really no standout
[01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:48.800]  manufacturer
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:51.760]  Samsung is a standout manufacturer though and
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:56.440]  And it yeah, you know it there's there's something there's something there
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:04.880]  And it's not so much that their devices are it the devices don't speak for themselves. It's something that they do strategically
[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:11.580]  Right because there's there's ways to compete other than the product Apple has chosen to compete on the product
[01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:14.580]  so I think people in the Apple world kind of
[01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:18.680]  Trigger on that but you can compete through distribution
[01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:23.760]  You can compete you can be through marketing like there's lots of places to compete and Amazon like like yeah
[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:28.760]  they were available to everyone and particularly when the everyone like the classic example is actually
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:36.600]  Motorola with the Droid phone which but this is what's that's an example of what Samsung did worldwide where Verizon was like
[01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:43.340]  Like we're bleeding customers because we don't have the iPhone like we need an alternative and like and
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:51.580]  some of Motorola's best years were like I was like that year when the Droid and there's the commercials everywhere because they just needed an
[01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:55.440]  Alternative and Samsung filled that role all over the world, right?
[01:31:58.060 --> 01:32:03.620]  Before we leave the topic of iPhone, let's talk about the S strategy and
[01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:06.180]  I
[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:07.380]  don't want to put words in your mouth
[01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:14.540]  but I think you're questioning whether the S strategy can continue which is and it to put it another way the tick-tock strategy of
[01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:21.100]  Here's a new form factor the iPhone let's just call it the iPhone 7 and
[01:32:21.780 --> 01:32:28.100]  A year later. Here's the same form factor, but with a whole bunch of new stuff inside the iPhone 7s
[01:32:28.700 --> 01:32:35.540]  Then the iPhone 8 then the iPhone 8s then the iPhone 9 iPhone 9s and that's put aside whether you
[01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:37.540]  know whether any of us think that
[01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:40.940]  Apple is gonna keep numbering the iPhones
[01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:46.820]  But you know this whole one year is a new form factor. The next year is the same form factor with an S
[01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:50.260]  You you question whether they
[01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:55.540]  Should continue with that, correct? Absolutely. You know, absolutely and I think
[01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:58.900]  One of the challenges with technology in general we've seen this species
[01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:06.240]  We see this with iPads is that at some point it just gets it's good enough for the majority of people and whatever
[01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:11.060]  Whatever in like the 6s is a big jump over the over the 6 in many respects
[01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:14.680]  But it's a big jump that doesn't really make a big difference in the way people use their phones
[01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:18.180]  day-to-day at least the majority of people and but
[01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:25.900]  Something that's so powerful about the iPhone it has made it such an iconic device has made it such a profitable device and in the u.s
[01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:32.420]  To a degree but particularly in places like China is the status of it. Like it is the we talked about the beginning
[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:35.860]  it's the best phone and and it means something that you carry it and
[01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:42.200]  There is no way this is why I think they've they've introduced the new colors on the s models
[01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:50.620]  because that can show you have the newest model, but I think they like if they want to push growth and we should talk about
[01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:53.940]  China because I think that that's the other real worry point for me. I
[01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:55.940]  I
[01:33:56.140 --> 01:34:01.220]  Question whether you can stick with this same form factor for two years because the thing about the phone
[01:34:01.220 --> 01:34:02.820]  It's a personal device you carry it with you
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:05.020]  You pull it out when you sit on the cafe and you put it on the table
[01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:11.100]  like it is like a car in that respect where it matters like what car you get out of and I
[01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:18.380]  Question how long they can stick with this strategy where you don't know if you're using last year's phone or this year's phone
[01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:20.820]  And it sounds super shallow, but it's a reality. I
[01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:27.380]  I I don't I don't necessarily question that going forward in terms of
[01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:29.780]  Where Apple goes in the future?
[01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:37.040]  But I want to take a moment just to point out and I suspect a lot of people listening might succumb to this
[01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:42.720]  Fallacious thinking because I've definitely seen it on Twitter and commentary on you know
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:46.700]  What iPhone you know what Apple it needs needs to or ought to do with the iPhone going forward?
[01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:50.700]  And I've noticed it for years. Is that people who are
[01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:57.540]  The more closely attuned you are to to this if you're the less less
[01:34:57.660 --> 01:35:01.100]  Casual you are of an iPhone user if you're you know an obsessive and you know
[01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:07.460]  Quite frankly if you're listening to this podcast, you're probably right pretty serious again and the tech
[01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:10.420]  gadget
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:12.060]  Journalism
[01:35:12.060 --> 01:35:19.680]  Racket in general has long. I mean forever right from the 3gs the 4s the 5s has always
[01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:21.900]  under
[01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:27.980]  Appreciated the success of those s models and and there's I think a conventional wisdom that
[01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:36.980]  People are only people that the general public the world is only interested in the new form factors and that
[01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:42.380]  They see because the the s ones look the same. They're not as interested in them
[01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:49.100]  And that's not true at all because this is the 6s is the first iPhone that hasn't outsold its predecessor
[01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:56.140]  The 4s outsold the 4 the 3gs outsold the the 3g and the 5s outsold the 5
[01:35:56.140 --> 01:35:59.780]  I have no idea why I went in that order for 3 5 but
[01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:07.600]  But it up until now no and no s model has failed to outsell its predecessor
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:10.060]  And like I said at least up until the 4s
[01:36:10.620 --> 01:36:17.320]  The 4s outsold all previous iPhones combined so now part of that as we've just said
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:21.500]  you know 10 15 minutes ago was about the worldwide expansion to more countries and
[01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:28.060]  Carriers, but it's really just the obsessives who say I'm bored by the form-factor
[01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:34.300]  But now that we are I but I do agree too though that it's it's so old
[01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:39.580]  I mean, we're almost you know next year is going to be the 10-year anniversary. I mean, we're a decade into the iPhone era
[01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:45.100]  It's amazing the world has changed. You know, it's there's no way, you know, what what was true
[01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:48.940]  You know in the early years is not going to be true going forward. It's you know
[01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:53.100]  Like everything in technology. It's you know, it's there's no way to expect
[01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:56.140]  What happened before to continue happening?
[01:36:57.180 --> 01:37:04.040]  So, I don't know that weeds well that that leads to I mean the the big engine for China or the biggest
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:10.700]  Rabbis gave away the big engine for Apple has been has been China and that's been the promise that it's this massive market that
[01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:12.700]  that we're growing in it's gonna be awesome and
[01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:15.180]  I'm
[01:37:15.180 --> 01:37:17.180]  exceptionally worried about China
[01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:22.300]  Exceptionally worried about China now and and for a few reasons. So first off
[01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:25.380]  Apple was up in China in the first quarter
[01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:33.340]  but people forget and I actually forgot originally in October or in 2014 when iPhone 6 launched the Chinese government actually
[01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:36.520]  held up the approval of the iPhone 6 and
[01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:42.540]  Even though Apple intended to launch it in September with everyone else. They didn't watch it until October 17th
[01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:50.220]  so on a year-over-year comparison you were comparing two and a half months versus three months and had you done a
[01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:54.080]  Straight-up comparison actually in q1. It would have been down in China one
[01:37:54.580 --> 01:38:00.820]  Two in q2 it was massively down in China in Greater China and and Tim Cook trying to take care to say oh in
[01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:05.420]  Greater in China itself is only down 7% or 11% or whatever
[01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:07.580]  It was all the drop was in Hong Kong
[01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:14.500]  the problem with that is a lot of those Hong Kong sells were gray market imports into China and as
[01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:22.020]  Availability increased in China. It was it's natural if the Hong Kong market would decrease and I think that's a red herring because I
[01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:27.140]  suspect the vast majority of the Hong Kong which was just demolished was
[01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:31.900]  People who used to buy in Hong Kong and smuggle into China and sell in China
[01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:35.500]  No longer did so because people just bought it in China now that was widely available
[01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:40.020]  and so I think you do have to look at it as a whole and it was down like
[01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:46.500]  27% or something like a huge amount and this is really really concerning because this is supposed to be the the the
[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:49.820]  Engine up because you again you don't one
[01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:55.260]  It's not just that you need up graders you who are arguably not upgrading as frequently
[01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:58.500]  You need to find new customers and the new customer
[01:38:59.180 --> 01:39:01.540]  engine was supposed to be China and and
[01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:06.140]  And the problem is that Tim Cook saying oh we sold a ton with the six
[01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:09.860]  So, of course it was down this year. Well, yeah, that's an upgrade story
[01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:16.340]  Where are the new customers and they're not materializing and you say oh well China's macroeconomic environment is challenging
[01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:18.540]  It is it is a problem
[01:39:18.540 --> 01:39:25.900]  but if you're in a greenfield environment where you're you have so many new people to sell to the
[01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:31.260]  Macroeconomics don't affect you like Apple in 2008 was not affected by the Great Recession
[01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:37.660]  Right because there was so many people to sell iPhones to it didn't slow the company hardly at all
[01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:38.060]  Yeah
[01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:43.220]  I wouldn't say they weren't it was that they had such they they were in such a period of growth that they
[01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:48.740]  Their growth exceeded the the positive aspects of their ability to grow
[01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:52.300]  Exceeded the negative aspects of the Great Recession
[01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:56.660]  You can't say they weren't affected. No, that's fair
[01:39:56.660 --> 01:40:02.780]  But the degree to which you are affected by macroeconomic conditions is a function of how mature your market is
[01:40:02.900 --> 01:40:09.340]  like the more mature your market is the more you're gonna be affected by macroeconomic conditions if you're in a in a in a
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:16.260]  New market where there's tons of growth opportunities like the macroeconomics don't affect you nearly as much and you like I
[01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:18.580]  listened to all these earnings call every like
[01:40:18.580 --> 01:40:23.860]  This is earnings call season for secretary like it was on my day updates about about earnings and I actually love earnings call
[01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:26.540]  I feel it's the time you can learn more about a company than almost any other time
[01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:32.940]  But the degree to which Apple for the last two quarters has focused on macroeconomic conditions
[01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:39.740]  it's kind of striking how it's far exceeded any other tech company like they're really concerned about the world economy growing to the ditch and
[01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:42.580]  Like Facebook's not worried about it
[01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:48.580]  Like they're doing fine like it's it's it's a testament to how mature your market is how much that affects you
[01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:51.500]  Isn't it also?
[01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:53.100]  sort of
[01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:55.100]  that Apple
[01:40:55.380 --> 01:40:59.200]  More than any of the other companies you might compare it to is shipping
[01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:03.580]  Adams not bits and that therefore they're they're more
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:08.060]  You know more affected by
[01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:12.060]  The currency exchange rates, you know
[01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:17.260]  No, well, I mean the currency is just whether you sell it. I mean Facebook has a great Asia Pacific business
[01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:24.700]  So they were affected for example and advertising for sure is impacted impacted by it by recessions. I think that
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:28.660]  the Adams versus I actually thought you were gonna talk about China because a
[01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:36.420]  Reason why Apple's been so successful in China is because they're shipping Adams not bits because bits can either be a copied or be blocked
[01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:38.420]  Yeah, that's true, right
[01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:45.980]  and the fact that they ship Adams that are differentiated by the software has made them like to a massive degree more successful than any other
[01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:47.980]  company in China and frankly
[01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:51.620]  Carl Akan getting out of the stock last week and blaming China
[01:41:51.620 --> 01:41:55.640]  I thought it was totally reasonable to be honest like I bring that are being blocked
[01:41:56.140 --> 01:42:01.940]  yeah, I mean like it's not it didn't cause a problem for Apple financially, but it's a worrisome sign and
[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:07.060]  Like it's very like Apple's China prospects
[01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:12.500]  Irregardless of whether they're saturated the market which is which is which is something that can be I mean
[01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:18.140]  Tim Cook talks about the upper middle class in China the upper middle class in China as it's defined in this McKinsey report he cites
[01:42:18.140 --> 01:42:19.900]  Which I actually cited first on this trajectory
[01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:24.580]  I'd like to think he got it from that but I don't know but the upper middle class is defined by an income of
[01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:27.220]  27,000 to 60,000 or sorry
[01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:30.460]  $16,000 to $35,000 US dollars
[01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:35.100]  And that's not very much money like in purchase power parity
[01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:40.980]  It's much more because stuff in China is cheaper, but iPhones aren't cheaper in China like they're actually more expensive in China
[01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:44.380]  They're in the US like you have to wonder like
[01:42:45.540 --> 01:42:51.540]  I'm concerned about this narrative in China like how big actually is the iPhone market in China
[01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:54.760]  And if and again it just goes back into this
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:43:00.880]  Like one Apple doesn't seem to know someone with the iPhone two. There's evidence that upgrade rates are
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:08.040]  Extending particularly as the iPhone pushes into the marginal customer. That's not a geek and upgrades upgrades every year, but then three
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:14.560]  in three they're not adding new carriers and then for the inch in China like maybe it's not nearly as
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:18.160]  big as we all thought it was like it there's
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:23.560]  There's genuine reason to be concerned and again the iPhones not going anywhere
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:25.080]  No one's replacing with Android
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:26.960]  It's gonna be super successful
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:31.200]  But where's the growth gonna come from and if the growth not gonna be there
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:34.960]  Then we're almost back at the services discussion if that makes sense like everything's connected
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:41.920]  Well, and the other thing Tim Cook mentioned and again, this is maybe a little worrisome. Is that Tim Cook spoke?
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:45.760]  Optimistically about growth in India and
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:52.560]  And sort of comparing it to China and I linked to it I thought was a really good piece by
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:56.320]  Rupesh
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:58.500]  Shander hope I'm pronouncing it right
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:04.920]  Who lives in India and is a longtime daring fireball reader and is as written to me many times over the past
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:10.000]  but he wrote about the differences between India and China and I almost summarized by his footnote in his
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:18.080]  His post which is I'll just read it entirely according to Pew Research less than 2% of Indians earn more than
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:23.440]  $20 a day or which is about seven thousand dollars a year as of 2011 and
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:29.920]  That's an increase of about zero point five percent over ten years in China
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:32.700]  The number of people who earn more than $20 a day
[01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:40.780]  Increased by five percent in the same period so China's there's a you know
[01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:44.020]  the similarity between India and China is that there's a
[01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:47.720]  Billion plus people in a lot of a lot of people a lot of people
[01:44:48.380 --> 01:44:53.520]  And so even if a relatively small number of people earn I can buy an iPhone
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:57.340]  Amounts of money
[01:44:57.340 --> 01:45:03.420]  a small percentage of a billion people is an awful lot of potential iPhone buyers, but that it
[01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:09.660]  India's economy is not doing as well as China's in terms of raising the number of people who earn you know
[01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:16.820]  seven seven thousand dollars or more a year and again if you only earn seven thousand dollars a year buying an iPhone is
[01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:24.660]  You know it's enormous right because it's you know iPhone is you know, even if you get the the SE it's you know
[01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:26.220]  $400
[01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:27.620]  Yeah
[01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:32.780]  He did he cited an observation that in his article which I was grateful for like
[01:45:33.540 --> 01:45:37.600]  iPhone and China are very different in two respects one is that
[01:45:38.100 --> 01:45:45.240]  China's just much richer than India like it's it's eight or nine times on a GDP basis like per person per capita basis richer one
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:47.560]  but then to
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:53.240]  Inequality in China is much greater than inequality in India and the implication of high inequality
[01:45:53.240 --> 01:46:01.020]  with a ton of people is that there's a lot of rich people right and so China has this huge number of people that are
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:07.720]  like living on Western standards and incomes and and India and you like
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:13.700]  Arguably to its credit. I mean if there's a lot of sociology goes into this, but they it's a relatively
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:19.120]  Equal country. So even the rich people in India one, there's not that many of them and two
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:26.760]  They're not that rich relatively speaking. So so the the market like even though it's a billion people the people who can afford an iPhone
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:29.640]  structurally much smaller
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:35.800]  Much smaller than it is in China. Yeah, it's so anybody looking for a China style explosion in India
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:38.560]  I don't think it's gonna happen and Apple added setback
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:41.160]  after results
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:45.500]  Where they'd been petitioning the government in India to allow them to sell
[01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:52.720]  Refurbished iPhones and that it got rejected which is weird the whole idea of not being allowed to sell
[01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:57.780]  Refurbished phones is weird, but it's it seems like some kind of political issue in India
[01:46:57.780 --> 01:47:04.940]  But that was the that was a big path for potential sales for Apple in India because it would allow them to sell
[01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:11.700]  The iPhones at prices that Indians could more likely afford and without being I don't know what Apple's doing
[01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:17.420]  It's it. Yeah, I know. Well, it's just sort of like the way that you can you know
[01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:22.020]  Like what what is like BMW strategy for reaching people who can't afford a new BMW?
[01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:28.780]  It's the certified BMW, you know certified pre-owned. They don't call them used. They're not used cars that are pre-owned
[01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:31.380]  certified pre-owned BMW
[01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:35.000]  And all the premium car makers have these certified pre-owned
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:41.120]  Things and that's the way that that premium car companies like BMW and Mercedes
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:46.280]  Porsche whoever you want to you know talk about they have these certified pre-owned sales things
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:51.640]  It's exactly what Apple's strategy is with the iPhone and yeah
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:58.080]  we're it's like two orders of magnitude different in price between say a new Mercedes and a new iPhone, but it's
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:00.600]  Apple's brand is exactly the same
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:07.380]  They're a premium phone maker and the way that they expand to the lower price points is with refurbished models
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:15.440]  Well, I also thought I'm confused about Apple's doing in India because they were they did something really interesting in India
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:20.180]  Which they haven't done in any other country, which is they they allowed for massive discounts of their phones
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:27.760]  So the 6s and the 6 were hugely discounted in India and you could get them for like you could get the 6s for something
[01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:32.080]  like $500 in India, which is massively less than in the US and
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:38.560]  and so when the when the SC launched I actually thought it was targeted India and I
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:44.500]  Presumed that even though watching it watching India for like $500 like but more expensive than the US
[01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:46.920]  I presumed in a matter of weeks or months
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:52.200]  it would be discounted to like $300 and I I thought they were gonna make a big push in India with the SC and
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:57.960]  It what they actually did was they cut off the discounts for the 6s
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:00.620]  So wouldn't compete with the SC and they raised it back up like $800
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:03.640]  because they felt it was suppressing SE cells and
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:07.160]  Like I
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:12.280]  Don't know one I don't know what they're doing to like I feel silly because like I
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:15.260]  Presumed their discounting was a strategy or an extend
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:21.220]  But three if that is their strategy where their entry-level phone is gonna be super expensive in India
[01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:29.000]  The SE like it's not no you're it's not gonna be China at all. Like and again, where's where are new customers gonna come from?
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  I don't know
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:37.320]  Before we leave with this idea that the Apple might need to abandon the S strategy. I
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:40.480]  the I see a few problems with that and
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:46.580]  One of them is that and I haven't done I should have maybe but
[01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:54.100]  Anecdotally and I could be just as wrong just as wrong as the people who who I know are wrong that the s models
[01:49:54.420 --> 01:50:00.380]  Generate less consumer interest or have in the past generated less consumer interest than the new model ones
[01:50:00.540 --> 01:50:06.300]  But I think that the new ones tend to be supply constrained when they're new in
[01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:12.420]  ways that the s model ones aren't for the very obvious reason that Apple is
[01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:17.060]  Good at making like for example last year the six
[01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:24.200]  iPhone 6 was supply constrained when it first came out and that was one of the reasons that the January to March quarter did so
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:25.180]  well
[01:50:25.180 --> 01:50:26.020]  Was it you know?
[01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:31.300]  One of the reasons was that it was delayed in China and then it was available in China and one of the reasons
[01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:37.580]  Simple reasons that q2 last year was so good for the iPhone 6 was that there were people who wanted to buy in q1 and
[01:50:37.580 --> 01:50:39.060]  had to wait
[01:50:39.060 --> 01:50:44.660]  and that to me is one of the very obvious reasons that Apple goes with this s strategy is
[01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:51.260]  That operationally it's a huge advantage because they're they get very very very efficient and good at making
[01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:56.260]  This form factor and all they have to do is put in like a new touch ID sensor
[01:50:56.260 --> 01:51:03.140]  Which is very different than making an entirely new aluminum case and an entirely new screen size and stuff like that
[01:51:03.140 --> 01:51:08.100]  So I just wonder I don't know that it's even feasible for Apple to make a new form factor every year
[01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:10.740]  I just don't think I think that's too too much too fast
[01:51:10.740 --> 01:51:16.260]  I don't think that I think it actually takes two years for them to to get you know to get in place to make a
[01:51:16.260 --> 01:51:18.020]  new form factor
[01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:19.300]  It's a fair point
[01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:26.740]  But I guess the counter to that would be is that when they did that with the 3g with 3 3g 3gs and 4 4s
[01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:31.620]  The volumes were so much less like there's a there's a very real factor in the market
[01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:37.540]  There's a there's a very real factor where the more you can spread out the fixed cost of your tooling in your factory
[01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:44.020]  Over the number of phones like the better margin you get it's called leverage and there certainly is an aspect to that
[01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:46.180]  But at this point they're selling
[01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:50.660]  Every year even in a down year they're selling so many more 6s
[01:51:50.820 --> 01:51:56.260]  They're selling more 6s and they sold 4s and 4s combined or certainly 3g and 3gs combined
[01:51:56.260 --> 01:52:01.460]  I think they have the scale at this point that they could
[01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:06.820]  They could justify the investment in tooling and and setting up lines
[01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:10.500]  Even if it was only over one year, but it is a very
[01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:13.460]  It's a fair question. I think
[01:52:13.940 --> 01:52:18.180]  You're exactly right. It's work to Apple's benefits. I mean, certainly they've changed the phone
[01:52:18.180 --> 01:52:25.140]  So I'm actually very curious to know how much benefit they do get because the 6s is a different phone than the 6 it is
[01:52:25.140 --> 01:52:27.140]  I'm curious how much
[01:52:27.620 --> 01:52:29.620]  Benefit they do get year by year
[01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:33.860]  Like do they really get a reuse that much tooling because they use different aluminum these all sort of stuff
[01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:36.260]  If they do get a lot of benefit
[01:52:36.260 --> 01:52:40.580]  Then the question is probably closer than I'm thinking about because there's a cost component to it as well
[01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:43.540]  but I don't know it just
[01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:47.940]  wasn't if they could and there's another factor which is that even if they could
[01:52:48.420 --> 01:52:54.820]  Manufacturing wise literally just snap their fingers and Johnny I've says he team says here's what this year's iPhone looks like
[01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:57.780]  If they could just snap their fingers and within a day
[01:52:58.180 --> 01:53:05.060]  Have the supply chain turning them out in the quantity that they need to meet demand even if it was that magical
[01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:08.740]  I don't know that I really doubt that
[01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:14.740]  Apples, you know the Johnny Ives team would come up with a new design every year. That was that was noticeably different
[01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:20.660]  Because now they're getting paid enough you can do it. Well, they could but they're their philosophy though
[01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:26.260]  They're their ethos is that they don't they they're the complete the idea of changing
[01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:32.500]  Making something look new just to have something that looks new is antithetical to their philosophy
[01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:38.900]  Which is that they are only going to make something look new if they are convinced that it's better
[01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:41.500]  And if not, then they won't do it. I
[01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:47.060]  Will tell you I couldn't go back to the size. I have it sitting here though, but this iPhone 5
[01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:53.820]  I'm 5s. I'm holding my hand is is a vastly more beautiful phone than my success. All right. Well, I find
[01:53:54.380 --> 01:53:58.260]  You know in terms of you know things I'm worried about with Apple in the long run
[01:53:58.260 --> 01:54:03.540]  It's the you know, the fact that I prefer the the I've been doing that I do it every time
[01:54:03.540 --> 01:54:07.540]  I keep it. I keep my SE review unit here. I don't use it day to day anymore, but
[01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:09.420]  I
[01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:13.900]  Much prefer the way I just sit here and worry stone it in my in my hands over and over again
[01:54:13.900 --> 01:54:19.520]  I find that they it's it's it's like the five to me the five and five s were the pinnacle of
[01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:23.000]  Because the the four was brilliant. It was so out of left field
[01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:29.960]  But the five like perfected the four right like it's it really is like the perfect the perfect form factor in my opinion
[01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:35.940]  Yeah, I find that the four was you know, well the fact that the back could crack was right
[01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:40.380]  that was the problem deficiency, but in the fact that you couldn't tell in your hand which side was which was sort of a
[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:48.020]  Inefficiency as well. I find it worrisome that Apple clearly in at least Johnny Ives team thinks that the six success
[01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:50.900]  form factor is superior to the
[01:54:51.900 --> 01:54:57.620]  five five s SE and size aside, I would I would prefer I think a
[01:54:59.140 --> 01:55:04.420]  4.7 inch phone that was had the flat sides, you know and sharp
[01:55:04.420 --> 01:55:11.320]  I think the seven will be better because I think what they were concerned about was like the round I think the Apple was so
[01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:15.060]  worried about making a big phone that I think the six like they did a lot of
[01:55:15.380 --> 01:55:19.540]  affordances in the six for a larger phone like having the rounded edges and stuff like that and
[01:55:20.060 --> 01:55:22.580]  And now that people are more comfortable with it
[01:55:22.580 --> 01:55:26.460]  I think they'll be a little more more exploratory with the seven
[01:55:26.460 --> 01:55:30.360]  the other thing too is actually the the support the the supply chain rumors, which
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:37.140]  Credit to the supply chain the supply chain nailed the success being being low like yeah
[01:55:37.140 --> 01:55:42.780]  It was widespread in Taiwan for sure and it got out of the Western media as well that the Apple was tamping down inventory
[01:55:42.780 --> 01:55:46.560]  Oh, here's a factoid John. I just I just posted this today because I did some calculations
[01:55:47.380 --> 01:55:52.020]  So Sony in their earnings and they actually did a warning. Wait, wait, wait in April
[01:55:52.700 --> 01:55:57.700]  where they said that their devices division where they make the they make the
[01:55:57.700 --> 01:56:04.140]  the camera sensors was gonna have a big miss and it was a real surprise that's been a real strength for Sony for the last
[01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:09.060]  Couple years and kudos to Sony by the way, the company is doing really really well and I couldn't be more pleased
[01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:14.920]  It's I think for us children of the 80s. Like it's a company that will always hold a special place in our hearts. Oh, but
[01:56:15.740 --> 01:56:21.380]  their devices had a big loss and they had to do a write-down and the write-down was of
[01:56:21.940 --> 01:56:24.300]  560 million dollars worth of sensors that basically
[01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:29.940]  They didn't sell and there was some speculations. It was a customer. What happened? What went on?
[01:56:30.380 --> 01:56:37.100]  It turns out if you go to the to the estimates of the success cost which obviously who knows if they're true or not
[01:56:37.300 --> 01:56:41.020]  But the estimate for the camera on the success is 2250
[01:56:41.420 --> 01:56:45.120]  $22.50 that may or may not include the lens assembly
[01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:51.940]  But if you presume that's the sensor that is that a sensor that cost $22.50
[01:56:51.940 --> 01:56:55.180]  if you take 560 million divided by 2250
[01:56:55.180 --> 01:57:00.900]  It comes up to 25 million sensors that Sony apparently made and one of their customers
[01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:08.780]  ended up declining to accept shipment of it turns out 25 million is about what most analysts think Apple over over
[01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:11.300]  forecasted the iPhone success
[01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:18.860]  Which is it's interesting on a few levels one like it was I already had in my head and that in not on my Excel
[01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:20.860]  spreadsheet that Apple had
[01:57:20.860 --> 01:57:25.020]  Lowered their forecasts by 25 million and it actually matched almost perfectly
[01:57:25.940 --> 01:57:30.540]  to it goes to show the leverage and power Apple still has that
[01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:35.260]  Sony had to eat it even though Apple is the one that screwed up
[01:57:35.860 --> 01:57:38.860]  But yeah, that was just a factoid that that was that was pretty interesting
[01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:45.260]  Just like you know what you know those sensors, you know what
[01:57:45.900 --> 01:57:47.900]  No, we're not gonna pay for them
[01:57:47.900 --> 01:57:52.260]  We're actually not gonna pay for them. Um, that is interesting. Where did you post that?
[01:57:52.260 --> 01:57:55.900]  I didn't see it and I thought I just did just it today. You might not seen it yet
[01:57:55.900 --> 01:58:00.980]  Was it like today's update? Oh, I thought I but I really thought before we started recording that I had caught up
[01:58:00.980 --> 01:58:07.060]  I was like, oh it was in a it was a section about Nintendo versus Sony. So it might oh, I skipped it
[01:58:07.060 --> 01:58:10.140]  I skipped the Nintendo part. I did see it, but then I skipped it
[01:58:11.540 --> 01:58:14.420]  Yeah, it was just stuck at the very end. Yeah, I don't
[01:58:15.540 --> 01:58:16.580]  Yeah
[01:58:16.580 --> 01:58:22.340]  It's interesting. I enjoyed the fixed typo too. This is this is why I don't think I could ever do
[01:58:22.340 --> 01:58:26.180]  Oh, I don't think I could ever do worse. It's awful. It's awful. Yeah, because
[01:58:26.700 --> 01:58:28.860]  Once it's out it's out. So there's always a balance
[01:58:28.860 --> 01:58:29.580]  Do you fix it or not?
[01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:36.620]  and so I did about Tesla and I said that they had had and cash out phone operations of 560 billion or 525 billion and
[01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:41.820]  525 billion is the market cap of Apple approximately like of course, it's not billion
[01:58:41.820 --> 01:58:47.340]  It's million and in the next sentence, I added up the stuff and it was clearly I meant million one of this
[01:58:47.340 --> 01:58:51.820]  but I it's one of the great flaws in the English language that
[01:58:52.300 --> 01:58:56.700]  It's million and billion and even trillion and whatever go on
[01:58:56.700 --> 01:59:01.220]  But especially in terms of what numbers we actually use and in terms of talking about money
[01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:03.780]  Million and billion are the only ones that really matter
[01:59:03.780 --> 01:59:06.540]  It's very, you know, there's very few discussions all into trillions
[01:59:06.540 --> 01:59:10.220]  But and they're only one letter like true of a trillion is two different letters, right?
[01:59:10.220 --> 01:59:14.100]  And so it's it's like significantly different. Yeah, but they should be it
[01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:20.700]  It's just it's it's helpful and proper and I think actually helps you understand how different
[01:59:22.140 --> 01:59:26.620]  1,000 from a million is because the word sounds so different and a hundred
[01:59:26.900 --> 01:59:30.220]  Sounds so different from a thousand even though it's only a tenfold difference
[01:59:30.620 --> 01:59:33.220]  It's only a tenfold difference from a hundred to a thousand
[01:59:33.540 --> 01:59:37.540]  A thousand to a million is a thousand fold difference and it sounds totally different
[01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:43.860]  but a million to a billion is a thousand fold difference and it sounds so similar and our brains just
[01:59:44.180 --> 01:59:46.180]  so many people's brains just
[01:59:46.220 --> 01:59:50.580]  naturally file them together and I totally understand the difference but
[01:59:51.260 --> 01:59:53.740]  in writing it is the easiest and
[01:59:54.620 --> 01:59:57.580]  Anybody who writes only made that mistake one way for sure
[01:59:57.580 --> 02:00:02.140]  It's so the worst thing with an email is because it's out there, right? And so I was just gonna leave it
[02:00:02.140 --> 02:00:05.100]  I saw it actually right away and I like crap but
[02:00:05.100 --> 02:00:10.300]  It buys gonna leave it but I got like double-digit like tweets and emails
[02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:14.280]  Yeah, cuz I feel like if you actually think about it, like obviously I meant million
[02:00:14.280 --> 02:00:18.500]  but I got more than usual like did you mean million or billion and like
[02:00:18.700 --> 02:00:24.820]  and so I had to issue the the follow-up email saying fixing this typo which I hate doing because like
[02:00:25.080 --> 02:00:29.300]  to me a really powerful aspect of this check remodel is I
[02:00:29.300 --> 02:00:36.140]  Insert myself into a place that people always look at with their email blocks and I take that like very seriously, right?
[02:00:36.140 --> 02:00:42.820]  And so to send a second email, I really hate doing but if I'm getting so many responses, like what did you mean?
[02:00:42.820 --> 02:00:46.940]  I feel like I have to correct it and like oh, yeah, right it depresses me
[02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:50.580]  So
[02:00:50.580 --> 02:00:52.580]  Before we move on to the final segment of the show
[02:00:52.580 --> 02:00:55.140]  But just hit the rumor mills the rumor mill though
[02:00:55.140 --> 02:01:00.620]  is that the iPhone 7 or whatever they're going to call it this fall the new iPhone this fall is going to be very very
[02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:04.540]  Similar to the it seems as though the s cycle is coming to an end
[02:01:04.540 --> 02:01:09.340]  But it seems as though the way it's coming to an end is not by coming up with new form factors every year
[02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:13.220]  But by extending existing form factors for additional years
[02:01:13.220 --> 02:01:19.220]  So first example proof of it we have is the iPhone SE which is the first time that the same form factors been used
[02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:21.500]  three times and
[02:01:21.500 --> 02:01:27.340]  The rumor mill is very strong that the I've that this year's iPhone. I don't even I
[02:01:28.300 --> 02:01:31.980]  I'm really starting to think they're not gonna call it the iPhone 7 just on a gut level
[02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:35.340]  So I don't want to call it that but for lack of a better term
[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:41.420]  The iPhone 7 is going to be in large part in just physically indistinguishable from the iPhone 6 and 6s
[02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:44.580]  Except that the antenna lines are moved. That's a bummer
[02:01:45.620 --> 02:01:48.900]  Yeah, that's a bummer. I don't I I'm with I'm not a huge fan
[02:01:48.900 --> 02:01:56.140]  um, well the allies gonna go the other direction the other rumor is that the iPhone the the
[02:01:56.740 --> 02:02:03.020]  2018 iPhone which would theoretically be the 7s is going to be no no 2017. That'll be 2017. No
[02:02:04.100 --> 02:02:09.860]  This is this year. Yeah, you're right. Sorry. You're right 2017. You're right fiscal year 2018 is then right confused example
[02:02:09.860 --> 02:02:14.580]  Right in October, but that that phone is also going to be markedly different from the
[02:02:15.660 --> 02:02:17.660]  2016 iPhone right which
[02:02:17.660 --> 02:02:20.460]  SIG so either one they're gonna like
[02:02:21.460 --> 02:02:26.140]  Extend the six to like three years, which you just kind of said or on the flip side
[02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:29.300]  They're gonna move into an annual refresh cycle
[02:02:29.300 --> 02:02:32.820]  I hope for I think it needs to be a refresh cycle
[02:02:32.820 --> 02:02:39.180]  But here's they ship a phone with the same form factor. I would be that would be amazing. Here is what I
[02:02:40.340 --> 02:02:44.940]  Wouldn't I would not wager heavily on any aspect of this, but if you wanted me to wager at all
[02:02:44.940 --> 02:02:50.100]  I think that they are getting away from the tick-tock s cycle
[02:02:50.140 --> 02:02:55.980]  But the way that they're doing it is not with significant. It's different. Here's what I think is going to happen
[02:02:55.980 --> 02:03:02.300]  I think that this year's iPhone new iPhones will only be in the 4.7 and 5.5 sizes
[02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:07.040]  There's not the SE if you like 4-inch iPhones, you might as well buy the SE now
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:11.180]  I really don't think that they're gonna come out with a new 4-inch iPhone six months from now
[02:03:11.180 --> 02:03:18.420]  I think it's gonna be 4.7 and 5.5. I think it'll largely look like the iPhone 6 and 6s
[02:03:18.420 --> 02:03:20.460]  I think that I
[02:03:21.740 --> 02:03:28.900]  This is the one the biggest question I have is whether both phones get the dual camera module or whether only the 5.5 plus does
[02:03:29.140 --> 02:03:32.860]  the rumor mill says that only the plus will I
[02:03:33.980 --> 02:03:40.100]  My gut feeling my spidey sense says that doesn't sound like Apple and it I think that maybe the reason the rumor mill has that
[02:03:40.100 --> 02:03:46.620]  Is that the schematics the only schematics that have leaked are for the 5.5 and that the schematics for the 4.7 didn't leak
[02:03:48.020 --> 02:03:54.460]  But I don't want to bet against it because so much of the rumor mill says only the plus is getting the dual camera module
[02:03:55.380 --> 02:04:01.340]  That just seems out of character to me because the 4.7 inch is the best-selling model
[02:04:01.340 --> 02:04:05.420]  So, I don't know it because it's the best-selling model. It just seems unusual, but I
[02:04:05.420 --> 02:04:11.180]  Just think whether they both get the dual camera or not. It's largely going to I think the rumor
[02:04:11.180 --> 02:04:16.340]  It was probably right that this year's phone will largely look like the 6 and 6s except that the antenna lines move
[02:04:17.540 --> 02:04:24.940]  And I think I haven't seen that actually that the only the plus is gonna get the dual camera or know that the no
[02:04:24.940 --> 02:04:26.940]  I hadn't seen that was gonna look the same
[02:04:27.180 --> 02:04:31.460]  I'll put it in the show notes and I'll send you a link privately, but I will put it in the show notes
[02:04:31.460 --> 02:04:33.460]  And
[02:04:34.060 --> 02:04:40.540]  Then I think next year's phone the 2017 model the one that will come out in September 2017
[02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:44.100]  What I have heard now, this is not really from the room
[02:04:44.100 --> 02:04:50.020]  oh, this is more just scuttlebutt that I've heard is that it will be an all-new form factor and
[02:04:50.940 --> 02:04:55.840]  And there have been some rumors, I guess they say this but what I'm saying is I've heard this independently that it is
[02:04:55.840 --> 02:05:03.040]  Is getting rid of the chip that'll completely get rid of the chin and forehead on the phone and it'll the entire front face
[02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:05.040]  Will be the display
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:09.840]  Interesting and that the you know touch ID sensor will be somehow embedded in the display
[02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:12.780]  The front-facing camera will somehow be embedded in the display
[02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:17.480]  The speaker everything all the sensors will be somehow behind the display
[02:05:17.480 --> 02:05:24.240]  And I what I don't know I have no idea but whether that means that they're going to shrink the actual thing in your hand
[02:05:24.640 --> 02:05:30.280]  To fit the size the screen sizes. We already have or whether they're going to grow the screens to fit the
[02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:35.560]  Devices were already used to holding. I don't know but that's what I think is gonna happen
[02:05:35.560 --> 02:05:40.240]  I think 2017 is going to be a the jaw-dropping. Wow, that's astounding
[02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:45.840]  That's an astounding industrial design iPhone and that this year's is not but it's not going to be
[02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:52.760]  The you really have to look at very very very very fine details to tell the difference between the 6 and 6s
[02:05:52.760 --> 02:05:56.120]  I think that this iPhone 7 or whatever you want to call it this year will be
[02:05:56.720 --> 02:05:59.240]  It'll largely look the same but that it you know
[02:05:59.240 --> 02:06:03.400]  There'll be some you know, like the antenna lines being different will make it pretty easy to tell that it's new
[02:06:03.400 --> 02:06:08.480]  That's what I've heard. Well, I I feel good about my prediction that that they're not going to turn the growth end. I
[02:06:09.480 --> 02:06:15.440]  Mean just I don't think that that's what drives it. I really don't I don't think that's what drives it
[02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:18.560]  I don't think that can suit, you know, normal people really care too much about that
[02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:24.760]  I disagree. Oh, at least at least on this side of the world like like it
[02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:31.880]  It matters that you can show off that you have the latest iPhone like it just it's a much more materialistic
[02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:38.280]  Displaying your status world than the the United States is. Well, can't they solve that?
[02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:43.120]  I think they could solve this while the luxury goods are sold here. I think they could solve that though with different anodization
[02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:45.240]  That might yeah, absolutely
[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:50.840]  Yeah, well, no, like I said, that's why I think they've launched the additional colors with the s models recently
[02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:56.920]  But yeah, it's interesting. Yeah, like the whole rose gold thing seems like the sort of
[02:06:58.680 --> 02:07:05.940]  Fashion oriented thing that it it's not like a long-term trend. It's a short-term fad
[02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:11.880]  Yeah, and that there may be you know, who knows what they'll do, but they're you know, obviously have a lot of opportunities
[02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:16.160]  you know, they could color them the any way they want they could go like, you know, like the way the the
[02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:22.440]  iPods used to be and go colorful. I mean and totally throw a loop and all of Samsung's
[02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:25.040]  rose gold production
[02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:30.120]  Whatever they call their way, but but what we learned with the 5c is it has to be the high-end iPhone
[02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:34.760]  That does it you can't come in on the in the middle level because an iPhone is high-end
[02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:37.240]  It has to retain that. Yeah. Yeah
[02:07:37.240 --> 02:07:44.880]  Yeah, right, I I don't it's it's fat. I mean we're in a really fasting time time with Apple. I mean
[02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:47.680]  it
[02:07:48.680 --> 02:07:55.800]  How can they I guess here's what concerns me here's what makes me really worried about about the last the last little bit
[02:07:56.480 --> 02:07:58.480]  it's that
[02:07:58.760 --> 02:08:00.320]  one
[02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:05.400]  It doesn't seem that Apple knows what's going on and that concerns me because we talked about like the changing
[02:08:05.400 --> 02:08:11.640]  Forecasts and what they said last year and stuff and that's very worrisome in general one and then two
[02:08:12.720 --> 02:08:14.720]  it feels like
[02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:16.800]  Cook has defaulted to
[02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:19.640]  the short-term
[02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:23.240]  expedient answer to questions that will prop up Apple stock as
[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:29.000]  Opposed to laying the groundwork for the what is best for Apple in the long term
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:35.220]  and Apple would be in better shape today if Apple if Tim Cook had been much more conservative last year and said
[02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:38.880]  this growth has vastly ceded our expectations which was true and
[02:08:39.800 --> 02:08:46.460]  Said we next year. We might be down like if he had like it would it he could have
[02:08:47.100 --> 02:08:52.800]  Adopted a conservative approach and Apple could have beaten it and they're like wow look at that
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:55.640]  Well, it turns out we're beating it or if they could have been like they are today
[02:08:55.640 --> 02:09:00.160]  Like yeah, as I told you last year like the six was amazing. Like we really crushed it
[02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:05.520]  We got super like we just everything came to we had China mobile with a big screen all at the same time
[02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:06.920]  It was a perfect year
[02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:08.600]  But like I told you last year
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:13.800]  Like that was probably gonna make to six 2016 tough Apple would be in better shape today
[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:19.000]  They really would be and it concerns me that cook did not take that approach, right?
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:22.160]  It's like the old counter to it's like the old Seinfeld skit about
[02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:27.440]  Nighttime Jerry screwing daytime Jerry and nighttime Jerry will stay up and watch the movie
[02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:35.040]  Knowing that that morning Jerry has to I love that analogy, right? Yes at 2015. Tim Cook hung
[02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:37.520]  2016 Tim Cook out to dry
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000]  yeah, or or
[02:09:40.280 --> 02:09:48.640]  knowingly or or unknowingly but yep, but 2016 today's Tim Cook has to you know want to kick 2015 Tim Cook
[02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:50.560]  in the ass
[02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:54.960]  Like what worries me is like Tim Cook. Did you watch the Jim Cramer interview with Tim? Yes
[02:09:55.520 --> 02:09:57.360]  yeah, like
[02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:02.920]  It worries me because it feels like 2016 to cook is now hanging 2017 to cook up to dry
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.320]  Yeah, and it's like, you know
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:13.600]  What do you think you know that that Tim Cook really has apples long-term interests at heart that he is not a?
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:16.320]  short-term quarter-to-quarter
[02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:21.240]  Thinker, he's not trying to maximize apples, but he has lots of stuff that looks like it's quarter-to-quarter
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:22.640]  Yeah, exactly
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:26.640]  Right you like you think you know that and and it's like you said that you you know
[02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:28.000]  It lends a lot of you
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:33.320]  You're willing to and or at least have been in the past been willing to take Tim Cook at his word because you think that
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:36.440]  But now you start to start you have to start wondering about that
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:43.280]  Like how much I will tell you as an analyst like I I really want to be right like it's super important to me
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:46.520]  Not because like and I makes I don't do stock picks and stuff like that
[02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:52.240]  But like I just try to be right I work really hard at my job and do what I do and it bugs me
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:54.240]  That I was wrong
[02:10:54.560 --> 02:10:59.280]  Because I believe Tim Cook and and and again
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:04.000]  That's my personal like problem like in Tim Cook doesn't need to worry about me
[02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:11.160]  but I think that Apple and the Apple stock and all the stuff that Tim Cook is worried about would be in better shape if
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:18.200]  Tim Cook had well, I don't know. It worries me. I wrote about this last year with Apple music
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:21.500]  We were sitting next to each other at the Apple music keynote
[02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:27.500]  We're we're just baffled and we should talk about your article. Like we're just baffled at this Apple music presentation
[02:11:27.500 --> 02:11:32.200]  It was so bad and and and I went back to my hotel room
[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:38.440]  I wrote about that day and I said and I talked about Tim Cook talks about focus and he says about how Apple so focused
[02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:40.440]  all sort of stuff and I'm like
[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:42.380]  I'm not seeing that from Apple
[02:11:42.380 --> 02:11:48.640]  I'm not seeing the the rhetoric is not matching what's coming out of the company and that concerns me and
[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:53.500]  Frankly what I wrote in that article my concern has only deepened since then
[02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:56.480]  Well, let's take a break. All right, we're going on
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:12:01.120]  We got a wrap-up soon, but I want to thank I've got super worked the scotch has done its job

[02:13:54.700 --> 02:13:57.240]  Yeah, I just wrote last night about
[02:13:58.020 --> 02:14:02.660]  Apple music because there was a leak or I don't know whether it was planned or not
[02:14:02.660 --> 02:14:06.180]  But Bloomberg had a story that there's a major
[02:14:08.580 --> 02:14:10.100]  Revamping of the
[02:14:10.100 --> 02:14:11.500]  Apple music
[02:14:11.500 --> 02:14:12.540]  user interface
[02:14:12.540 --> 02:14:16.340]  I guess there's one way to put it that it's gonna you know to at least in and
[02:14:16.620 --> 02:14:21.060]  according to Bloomberg an acknowledgement that what they shipped last year was confusing or
[02:14:21.060 --> 02:14:27.160]  Convoluted or just not just not well designed and that it will be coming again like last year at WWDC
[02:14:28.580 --> 02:14:30.580]  Which I'm sure all the devs are thrilled about
[02:14:33.060 --> 02:14:40.100]  How much is the WWDC keynote even about developers anymore no, I know I know it was it was it was a watermelon
[02:14:40.100 --> 02:14:42.100]  It's right there. I had to take a swing at it
[02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:48.380]  Right. I don't know. I think that's a little I mean, there's some truth to it
[02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:54.300]  But now I agree it is it is a public event. No, it's it's just like any other Apple keynote, right?
[02:14:54.300 --> 02:14:56.300]  and the reason why I'm really
[02:14:58.140 --> 02:15:02.300]  I'd not move by the argument that the WWDC morning keynote
[02:15:02.860 --> 02:15:04.100]  audit
[02:15:04.100 --> 02:15:08.140]  necessarily needs to be developer related even tangentially is that it's
[02:15:08.660 --> 02:15:17.140]  Followed by in the afternoon that what the Apple calls the state of the Union which in in plain English is the technical keynote
[02:15:17.140 --> 02:15:18.500]  like
[02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:21.580]  WWDC every single year has two keynotes a morning keynote
[02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:25.980]  which is the one that everybody in the general everybody knows about and then
[02:15:26.260 --> 02:15:32.420]  There's a lunch break and then you come back in and there's a technical keynote and the technical keynote the state of the Union
[02:15:32.780 --> 02:15:38.420]  Could not possibly be more nerdy. I mean, it's talk about frameworks. It is, you know source code
[02:15:38.420 --> 02:15:40.880]  Let me show you coding on screen, right? They show you source code
[02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:44.920]  I mean it couldn't be more so if that's what you want if you're like, I'm a developer and I paid
[02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:51.040]  $1,600. I want a total keynote. You're gonna get it anyway, you know, so I say, you know, you know
[02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:58.200]  If you don't and if you don't want the non technical keynote sleep in and skip the morning keynote, I don't have any sympathy for that argument
[02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:01.360]  Definitely go to the bathroom in the women's bathroom, right?
[02:16:02.760 --> 02:16:04.120]  No
[02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:06.120]  No, what are you talking about?
[02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:13.420]  No, it wasn't the women's bathroom. You're you're totally you're confusing. Oh, you're right. No, he North Carolina, right North Carolinian law
[02:16:13.420 --> 02:16:15.020]  I would not endorse
[02:16:15.020 --> 02:16:20.740]  Excuse me. Well, you're conflating it with last year you and I sat in the WWDC keynote together
[02:16:20.740 --> 02:16:23.120]  And we both we got in early
[02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:28.260]  Because they they used to in the old days only let the press in like five minutes before the keynote started
[02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:32.880]  They let us in early and we had plenty of time, but we both thought maybe we should
[02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:39.000]  Maybe we should take a bathroom break before this and it was good that we did because the goddamn keynote went on so long
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:45.120]  And you go out now. This will be all different this year because it's gonna be at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium instead of
[02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:52.720]  Upstairs top floor in Moscone, but top floor Moscone the men's room line was I mean seriously no exaggeration
[02:16:53.420 --> 02:17:00.640]  50 60 75 people out the door in the mail is ridiculous. And of course, there's no for the record the women's yeah, exactly
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:03.800]  There's never a line in the women's bathroom. We did not go into women's bathroom
[02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:09.640]  Though what we did is we took the elevator down to the first floor and went to the first floor men's room
[02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:16.080]  Which had no one where there was no one and then we we came back up to the to the third floor
[02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:19.920]  And we saw the line and I was just gonna go back and retake my seat
[02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:24.840]  But you acted like a good Samaritan and started trying to tell people in the line
[02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:30.600]  Hey, you know you can go downstairs if you go downstairs. There's no one listen to me. Nobody listen. No one listen
[02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:34.600]  That's why I didn't bother. It doesn't doesn't doesn't pay to be a good Samaritan been
[02:17:35.620 --> 02:17:37.360]  Doesn't pay
[02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:40.560]  This is what happens. See I still have this small number of Twitter followers
[02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:44.520]  I don't have the superpowers quite that you do so I still have empathy for my fellow man
[02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:48.840]  I can't believe that I say I can't believe that literally men literally a baby for my fellow mine
[02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:52.200]  I can't believe that you misremembered it as us sneaking into the women's bathroom
[02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:58.960]  It's totally true that the women's bathroom definitely had no light I mean no yes
[02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:02.840]  That's a commentary and the problem is the technology. I don't know why though. I remembered
[02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:08.560]  It does occur to me though that we will I don't know what you know
[02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:14.640]  That's just that's a minor hiccup in the Bill Graham civic auditorium plan where there won't I don't I don't think there will be such
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:15.760]  a thing as
[02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:19.200]  Well, fortunately you walked you if you walk there you go through the tenderloin first
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:22.040]  So you can just go to the bathroom on the street before you get there. I
[02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:31.040]  Didn't know how to phrase that I wrote when I wrote that that's interesting because it's it's a bit of a
[02:18:31.400 --> 02:18:34.520]  Daring fireball I wrote it's a bit of a hike from the
[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:39.720]  Moscone area hotels and Moscone is surrounded by by hotels
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:44.240]  To the Bill Graham civic auditorium and somebody a few people wrote to me
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:48.120]  And they like you know either cited Google Maps or Apple Maps, and they're like it's you know
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:50.120]  it's like a mile and they're like
[02:18:50.120 --> 02:18:54.600]  Are you you know do you are you seriously so lazy that you that you think that's a hike and
[02:18:54.800 --> 02:19:00.080]  Really what I meant by a bit of a hike is that it's it's not so much that it's far, but that it's not
[02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:05.920]  It hey, it's definitely unpleasant and B. It's it's questionably unsafe
[02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:10.960]  To walk there, it's a little better to be fair, but but yeah
[02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:16.040]  If you're walking in the morning argue everyone that's gonna bother you is asleep right, but yeah
[02:19:16.040 --> 02:19:20.040]  Yeah, it's probably better. Just just just take a taxi or happen there, or do you do the moon?
[02:19:20.040 --> 02:19:27.720]  The muni goes right down Market Street. Yeah, anyway the well, but dad, but how does how does the muni economy thousands of thousands of people?
[02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:31.920]  You know I mean like it's not and you know I mean in there in like uber and stuff like that
[02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:35.080]  It's like it's it's if lots and lots of people's not that many
[02:19:36.200 --> 02:19:38.720]  Right I don't know well. I don't know I think it'll be alright, but
[02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:43.280]  Anyway Bloomberg says Apple music big revamp
[02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:47.120]  An acknowledgement and whether I'm not that they're going to acknowledge it
[02:19:47.120 --> 02:19:51.160]  But that the revamp is an acknowledgement that it was it people were confused by what they had last year
[02:19:51.160 --> 02:19:53.920]  And they're going to announce it at WWDC again
[02:19:55.520 --> 02:20:02.320]  So I'm one thing you talked about is you felt like the best thing would be to break apart Apple music from iTunes and
[02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:07.440]  Like from a product design perspective I can 100% agree with you
[02:20:07.600 --> 02:20:12.880]  But one thing that's interesting is it has become more apparent over the last year
[02:20:12.880 --> 02:20:14.640]  Is that Apple's?
[02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:22.560]  integration of iTunes and Apple music is arguably a strength in some scenarios like for example when you have like all the stars now are
[02:20:22.960 --> 02:20:26.560]  Adopting this windowing strategy where they first make their stuff available
[02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:30.760]  For purchase so they're in a super smart, right?
[02:20:30.880 --> 02:20:36.560]  If Adele makes her a CD available for only for purchase now for streaming all her best fans
[02:20:36.760 --> 02:20:41.680]  give her $10 or $15 or whatever it is Beyonce's album was like $18 and
[02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:48.120]  Then a year or two later they open up to streaming and get all the marginal fans that went to have paid for it
[02:20:48.120 --> 02:20:53.760]  So it's super smart for them and only Apple has a solution where those are
[02:20:54.760 --> 02:20:58.800]  Connected like you have one app that has your purchased Adele tracks
[02:20:58.800 --> 02:21:04.680]  And you're streaming other tracks whereas if they were separate apps you would have to
[02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:09.680]  Preemptively choose the right app to get to your music. That's a fantastic point, and I'm probably wrong
[02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:15.880]  And you know that that the that the right way to do it is to break it into a separate app, but I think
[02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:24.160]  Whatever they come up with has to have that level of clarity between what is yours and what is
[02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:31.240]  streaming and just think about like Jim Dow Rimple's complaints throughout the year of the way that his
[02:21:31.840 --> 02:21:34.400]  library got screwed up, you know like
[02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:36.400]  It it
[02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:43.400]  That doesn't happen if Apple music is a standalone app you know oh, I'll tell you what the problem is with Apple music
[02:21:43.400 --> 02:21:47.680]  I think it's actually pretty straightforward if you open Apple music. There's five tabs on the bottom
[02:21:47.680 --> 02:21:53.200]  I'll read from left to right number one for you number two new number three radio number four connect number five my music
[02:21:53.240 --> 02:21:57.280]  the reality is I spend 98% of my time in my music and that's
[02:21:57.280 --> 02:22:03.240]  Smushed into one tab and that includes not just my music that I bought in iTunes
[02:22:03.240 --> 02:22:06.080]  But also like Apple music if I want to search for something Apple music
[02:22:06.080 --> 02:22:11.440]  I have to go to my music and search like they've broken out these four tabs that are
[02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:19.760]  That are just I don't use and I suspect most people don't use and I think that's where the mistake came in like they need
[02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:20.800]  to
[02:22:20.800 --> 02:22:26.160]  like at the end of the day people what would make mode makes music such a great business and
[02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:33.520]  What and what reason why Jobs was so focused on owning the music is that people tend to they just want to listen the same
[02:22:33.520 --> 02:22:41.160]  Stuff again and again right and Apple music over index on this discovering new music like I don't like for you
[02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:46.600]  And new why are those different things like and then connect? I mean, I'm sorry Apple
[02:22:46.600 --> 02:22:49.160]  I will if Apple ever
[02:22:49.880 --> 02:22:55.280]  Berths a successful social sort of network. I will eat a literal hat like
[02:22:55.280 --> 02:23:00.320]  That needs to go the like radio. Maybe that should be different app
[02:23:00.320 --> 02:23:06.040]  I don't know for you a new should be combined and if you break out like my music that I've collected either
[02:23:06.040 --> 02:23:11.160]  I bought it in iTunes or I saved it from the Apple music from Apple music to be in my collection
[02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:15.080]  And then you have a separate search tab. Like where does the search tab? It should be its own tab
[02:23:15.080 --> 02:23:18.560]  I actually think there is a solution to make this app
[02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:21.920]  significantly more manageable
[02:23:21.920 --> 02:23:24.960]  I my idea for a standalone
[02:23:26.040 --> 02:23:29.680]  Apple music app which again I haven't it's not like I've sat and designed the whole thing
[02:23:29.680 --> 02:23:31.520]  But and when people object to hey
[02:23:31.520 --> 02:23:34.680]  But I but I just want one place to listen to whatever I've got
[02:23:34.800 --> 02:23:42.040]  My idea is predicated on the idea that in the way that other apps have always had apps access to your music library
[02:23:42.200 --> 02:23:48.800]  Like when you're in iMovie you can import a song from your music right that this Apple music app
[02:23:48.800 --> 02:23:54.560]  Would have like let's say if there's a band that's or an album like a new Adele album
[02:23:54.560 --> 02:23:59.160]  That's not in Apple music streaming yet. If you have it in your personal music collection
[02:23:59.160 --> 02:24:00.680]  Then you could still play it from there
[02:24:00.680 --> 02:24:02.040]  It would just magically
[02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:07.240]  You know, it would it would appear there with some sort of visual indication that it's there because you own it
[02:24:07.240 --> 02:24:12.000]  So I'm not arguing against it. I'm just saying that the visual design it should just treat
[02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:19.120]  You basically the way I would propose it would be that it would treat any track you have in your personal library whether it's like
[02:24:19.120 --> 02:24:27.160]  Not available like the new Adele album or whether it's like prints like an artist who just didn't sell streaming rights to Apple music
[02:24:27.560 --> 02:24:32.360]  Or whether it is something like a live recording of an album
[02:24:32.360 --> 02:24:36.200]  That's you know, like passed around by fans like Marco's band fish
[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:39.920]  You know, but if it's in your personal library
[02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:47.080]  It would appear in Apple music in the same way that you're that your music appears and I'm movie and whatever else
[02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:53.320]  So I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to that that you'd have to go to a different app to listen to this stuff in your stuff
[02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:58.800]  I'm just saying like I think it you're arguing that it just shouldn't be segregated so much down at the bottom and in tabs
[02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:07.240]  Yeah, well, I mean the problem is like it would know I yeah, the problem is Apple music isn't really about my music, right?
[02:25:07.240 --> 02:25:12.240]  it's about what Apple like Apple thinks you should ought to listen to and literally I
[02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:18.200]  There are five tabs in Apple music and I don't touch four of them and the only reason I subscribe to help music
[02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:22.200]  And this is actually to take this full circle to the services thing
[02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:29.160]  the I'm still subscribed to Apple music and the reason I am is because when I drive my kids around like we always listen to songs and
[02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:35.880]  And I use Siri to like they request songs and I use Siri to want to listen to songs
[02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:41.000]  And I use Siri to want to watch the song and of course Siri doesn't have an API
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:47.840]  So it doesn't support like Spotify or other things and it's it's it's interesting because it gets into this tension
[02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:52.520]  Like what is Apple's strategy? Where are they trying to make money? Like in this case Siri is
[02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:54.440]  actually
[02:25:54.440 --> 02:25:57.120]  forcing me to give more money to Apple as
[02:25:57.800 --> 02:26:02.560]  Opposed to Spotify just because it works there and also my daughter loves Taylor Swift. That's the other reason
[02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:06.720]  And you don't have you don't own any Taylor Swift. You just listen to it through Apple music
[02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:14.560]  No, I think I got 1989. I think I actually got 1989 when Taylor Swift did her breakup with
[02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:18.480]  Spotify and I wrote about for the update. I thought was I thought was really interesting
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:25.360]  Yeah, so now in so I've adopted a Twitter persona of being a a Taylor Swift fan
[02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:30.000]  Which I enjoy it's kind of an ongoing gag on exponents about me me and Taylor Swift. So
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:34.160]  Is this a good segue to talk about the Amazon echo that you've tricked me into buying
[02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:42.160]  Yeah, we I mean you so you we you have said and written I think that
[02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:47.360]  You know Amazon echo and a lot of people have good words about Amazon echo
[02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:53.520]  No further for the record what I know I want to get something record when and the echo launched almost everyone dumped on it and
[02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:57.440]  As far as I read I was the only person that was enthusiastic about it
[02:26:57.440 --> 02:27:02.480]  And people were dumping on it because it was when the phone they had Amazon just written off the fire phone, right?
[02:27:02.480 --> 02:27:06.480]  which was obvious from day one was was a was a mess and
[02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:09.520]  The echo though. So there's two things one
[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:16.480]  This gets at Amazon is such a unique company in that they're built to run experiments and to fail or succeed
[02:27:17.120 --> 02:27:19.120]  and the in the phone failed and the
[02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:24.880]  Admiral thing about the phone is even though Bezos was clearly one it probably shouldn't have launched the phone
[02:27:24.880 --> 02:27:30.320]  It was obviously a bad idea, but to should have been identified should have been identified internally as well
[02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:33.120]  it should have been this is but this is the way they
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:38.320]  The way they ruthlessly killed it was it very impressive
[02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:45.520]  Right, even though as Bezos as a baby when it failed utterly like he cold-blooded
[02:27:45.520 --> 02:27:49.840]  We killed it late like way up again. I'm not glorifying weighing off people
[02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:52.960]  It's a tragedy that people lost their jobs. Although they were in the wrong place
[02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:56.480]  It's a tragedy that people lost their jobs. Although they were engineers in Silicon Valley
[02:27:56.480 --> 02:28:03.120]  I'm sure they they survived but like they weighed off people they shut the whole thing down. It was over like they realize we
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:09.440]  In Bezos probably realize personally I got wrapped up in this I made a mistake and
[02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:13.600]  In some respects being able to recognize and own your mistake
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:21.680]  Especially when you're someone who's succeeded so wildly as someone like Jeff Bezos is super impressive and and and kudos to them
[02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:24.480]  The echo comes out and the echo thing with echo
[02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:30.160]  It was so different than the fire phone because the echo was all the echo was a conduit
[02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:35.680]  It's a conduit to Amazon services and you could see the connection to bike buying stuff, you know
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:41.360]  And leveraging up Amazon's cloud power power. It was totally different than than the fire phone was
[02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:42.320]  uh
[02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:47.920]  but but I think it was kind of dumped on the beginning because people were walked into the fire phone was you can't actually buy
[02:28:47.920 --> 02:28:52.000]  Stuff through it or it can you I guess what you can do is add stuff to your shopping list
[02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:54.800]  Because you can tell I think you can buy stuff now
[02:28:55.440 --> 02:28:59.840]  When it launched you could only ask if your shopping list, but I believe they've added buy stuff now
[02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:03.600]  Oh, and we were playing with it and and jonas and amy
[02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:07.440]  I'm not i'm not certain on that jokingly did something like that and then
[02:29:09.120 --> 02:29:15.280]  Alexa said uh, she was adding it to john gruber shopping list and they panicked and they're like no cancel cancel
[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:17.280]  So
[02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:22.560]  I'm ragging on a little it's an interesting device. I don't regret the money I spent on it
[02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:28.260]  But it it's i'm not as impressed by it as I think you are but maybe I don't have enough of these add-ons
[02:29:28.800 --> 02:29:33.360]  That add new services. I mean this is so one of the fundamental differences
[02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:38.000]  Between alexa and siri
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:46.320]  And and let's just imagine that apple has a siri device. That's the same as alexa. So we're not comparing phones and tablets to
[02:29:46.960 --> 02:29:50.160]  The stand let's just because it very would be very easy for apple to do the same thing
[02:29:50.160 --> 02:29:52.800]  Just make a speaker with a microphone that you can say
[02:29:53.520 --> 02:29:59.120]  The i'm not going to say it because I know it'll trigger people's phones the hey and then the siri
[02:29:59.760 --> 02:30:04.640]  And then you talk to it. Hey, it's very it's very easy. Don't screw with people then
[02:30:04.640 --> 02:30:09.120]  It's very easy to imagine a similar apple product and it would be very different because
[02:30:09.840 --> 02:30:16.560]  The way that siri works is very different from the way alexa works in terms of the structure that is expected
[02:30:18.160 --> 02:30:23.520]  Alexa is is far more expects far more structure in what you
[02:30:25.360 --> 02:30:28.640]  Tell i'm going to say her tell her to do than siri does
[02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:34.800]  For better and for worse in my opinion, I think some of it is significantly worse and it's kind of disappointing
[02:30:36.560 --> 02:30:43.040]  But your argument is that because once you know what you can tell her to do it works way more reliably
[02:30:44.240 --> 02:30:51.440]  Well, so I think we talked about like yeah like siri is definitely trying to focus on like pure natural language processing where it will figure out
[02:30:51.440 --> 02:30:55.120]  What what you say whereas alexa is much more reliable than siri
[02:30:55.120 --> 02:31:00.720]  And so there's multiple factors going on here. So so one and there's a great I think it was business insider
[02:31:00.720 --> 02:31:08.720]  there's a great profile of how like the story of alexa and how like they were they presented a bezos and they're like we're gonna have two
[02:31:09.600 --> 02:31:12.800]  Two milliseconds of like latency and he's like no it has to be one
[02:31:13.600 --> 02:31:15.600]  and sorry, but
[02:31:15.840 --> 02:31:23.040]  Alexa is unbelievably fast like it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
[02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:28.080]  Unbelievably fast like in the speed in which it processes kind of like what you say
[02:31:28.720 --> 02:31:33.040]  Um, so the one that's that's already a plus I think over siri
[02:31:33.680 --> 02:31:34.880]  but two
[02:31:34.880 --> 02:31:36.880]  It's interesting. It's like
[02:31:37.200 --> 02:31:39.200]  it's hard to
[02:31:39.520 --> 02:31:40.800]  Know
[02:31:40.800 --> 02:31:45.600]  Including google. I think google is actually still the best. I think it's still better than alexa although alexa is close
[02:31:46.960 --> 02:31:48.320]  No
[02:31:48.320 --> 02:31:53.840]  voice recognition is yet at the level where it can interpret everything and I
[02:31:54.320 --> 02:31:55.920]  Kind of feel
[02:31:55.920 --> 02:32:02.740]  I feel this both kind of intellectually and also having used different devices that it's better to fail predictably
[02:32:03.360 --> 02:32:08.000]  Than it is to fail unpredictably if that makes sense. Yeah, and I feel like alexa
[02:32:09.600 --> 02:32:16.400]  I think you're right. I I you might be right, but I feel like that the the only proper solution is is
[02:32:16.400 --> 02:32:22.480]  Is uh, ai that it rec it's so accurate that you you almost never get errors
[02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:28.560]  You know that it you know, it almost doesn't matter which way you start now whether you start on the side of failing
[02:32:28.720 --> 02:32:36.640]  Predictably like alexa or failing unpredictably like siri because ultimately both of them still have are like one percent
[02:32:36.960 --> 02:32:38.960]  solutions that are 99 unfulfilled
[02:32:40.240 --> 02:32:45.280]  I agree, but I it's weird because when I feel like when whatever alexa doesn't understand me
[02:32:45.280 --> 02:32:47.280]  I feel like I did it wrong and
[02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:55.040]  I I would say 90 of the time that's a bad thing for technology like technology should have empathy towards the user and to
[02:32:55.520 --> 02:32:57.200]  Blame the user is a bad thing
[02:32:57.200 --> 02:33:02.240]  Like there's this article spreading around on twitter today about like someone losing their apple music and there's like counter articles like oh no
[02:33:02.240 --> 02:33:04.880]  You set it up that way like no that's apple music's fault
[02:33:04.880 --> 02:33:10.560]  Like you should not make a use you should not enable the circumstances in which a user does the wrong thing, right?
[02:33:10.560 --> 02:33:16.240]  But in this particular area when alexa when I say the wrong words and alexa doesn't get it
[02:33:16.640 --> 02:33:18.800]  I try to figure out the right words. Like I feel like
[02:33:19.440 --> 02:33:25.280]  It's that like I feel like alexa is really good. So I want to make sure I get it right
[02:33:25.600 --> 02:33:32.960]  Whereas with siri I get frustrated and I in part of it is the siri. I feel like the siri joking stuff and and being
[02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:38.000]  jocular is actually really bad for it because
[02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:41.520]  It it imparts a degree of
[02:33:42.960 --> 02:33:46.800]  Accuracy and realism that is un that is just not true
[02:33:47.040 --> 02:33:52.800]  It's like over promising and under delivering per point before and oh, I don't get that from when alexa doesn't understand
[02:33:52.800 --> 02:33:57.760]  We're saying it's like sorry. I don't understand what you said. Like it's very straightforward, right? And I
[02:33:58.400 --> 02:34:05.440]  Just it's different approaches and I I think the alexa one is better but so she says something like I don't understand the question
[02:34:05.440 --> 02:34:08.880]  It's like she says something like I don't understand the question. I think you said
[02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:11.680]  it right, it's like it's like
[02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:14.240]  I didn't make a joke about it. It's like
[02:34:15.280 --> 02:34:17.280]  I understand your words, but I don't know what you're talking about
[02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:21.200]  No, I I the way that the what she says, I wish I knew it exactly
[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:28.720]  But the way the way that she'll say I don't understand the question. I I heard from you indicates both that either
[02:34:29.520 --> 02:34:33.520]  either she heard you word for word exactly and doesn't know how to answer that or
[02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:38.000]  Maybe she didn't hear you correctly. But either way she can't answer you and it do you know what I mean?
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.480]  It's a kind of an interesting way to phrase the air. I see what you mean
[02:34:40.480 --> 02:34:46.640]  And I I have mixed feelings about series jocularity. I and it does seem a little un-apple like
[02:34:47.760 --> 02:34:48.880]  because
[02:34:48.880 --> 02:34:50.880]  Apple's actually taken
[02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:56.480]  In large part, especially on iOS has taken the whimsy out of the visual UI
[02:34:56.720 --> 02:34:59.600]  you know that that one way of looking at the the
[02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:05.200]  Looking at the the the iOS 6 to iOS 7 transition, you know
[02:35:05.920 --> 02:35:08.080]  You know, everybody uses the word skeuomorphism
[02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:12.000]  but one way of looking at it another way of looking at a different word would be that they took a lot of the
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000]  whimsy out of the UI
[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:21.920]  That you know having wood paneling around game center or a leather, uh, you know, rich Corinthian leather around your calendar
[02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:26.240]  Um, or your find your friends or whatever it was that had the the Corinthian leather
[02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:32.320]  Is whimsical and that they took that out, but Siri is chock-full of whimsy
[02:35:34.080 --> 02:35:40.640]  Yeah, it's weird because Apple has this brand about perfection and and
[02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000]  There is an aspect where
[02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:50.080]  Like oh it's we it's hard it's really weird to say that
[02:35:50.720 --> 02:35:55.360]  To the extent that Alexa makes it feel like it's my mistake is a good thing because again
[02:35:55.360 --> 02:36:01.840]  That goes against my instincts of our product design in general and that you should strive to make things obvious for the user
[02:36:02.240 --> 02:36:05.680]  But I think it works to its benefit like and I think it would
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:09.200]  Serve Apple and the Apple brand better when Siri screws up
[02:36:09.200 --> 02:36:18.400]  I blame Siri because Siri has it's over promised and under-delivered frankly and and so this is just at a very hell from the so one
[02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:24.720]  Alexa's voice recognition is much better than Siri like vastly better one. I don't know much faster than Siri
[02:36:25.280 --> 02:36:28.560]  Well for okay. Well, here's my test example for me
[02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:31.520]  For so one for me Alexa's much better than Siri
[02:36:32.320 --> 02:36:38.320]  To my daughter can trigger Alexa without fail. She's eight years old and she can
[02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:45.600]  Rarely trigger Siri maybe 10% of the time three my four-year-old son can can command Alexa
[02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:48.240]  Maybe 30% of the time
[02:36:48.880 --> 02:36:56.480]  But he definitely can never ever trigger Siri and in like the degree to its Alexa can handle poor
[02:36:57.520 --> 02:37:04.560]  I mean immature. Yeah. Yeah, it's super impressive in my in my estimation. All right, maybe it is better. I I don't know I
[02:37:05.520 --> 02:37:10.640]  I told you this I I said the thing I thought so I'm five days into owning Alexa and I haven't added
[02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:17.360]  Any significant number of the third-party editions which we should talk to you because I know that this having an API period is a huge difference
[02:37:18.240 --> 02:37:20.240]  And I know it's one of the reasons that you're
[02:37:20.640 --> 02:37:22.640]  on the Alexa side of the argument, but I
[02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:29.920]  I set it up and I mean when this when this query failed I immediately like texted you to complain like you're you're my tech
[02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:32.560]  support for for the echo, but I asked
[02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:37.920]  Alexa when do the Golden State Warriors when's the next Golden State Warriors?
[02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:45.680]  Game, and she said I don't understand the question and then I said when is the next Warriors NBA game or something like that?
[02:37:45.680 --> 02:37:50.800]  I took out the Golden State and maybe like added NBA and then she got the answer, but I can't believe that
[02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:55.280]  You know and again. I'm not saying that Siri doesn't have the exact same sort of
[02:37:56.080 --> 02:38:00.560]  Ask the same thing one way and ask it a different way where a human would
[02:38:01.200 --> 02:38:05.040]  Undeniably interpret the questions the exact same way no human being would
[02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:09.680]  You know think that that was a different question even though you phrased it differently and it works one way and doesn't the other
[02:38:09.840 --> 02:38:14.640]  But to me Alexa has this exact same shortcoming where I say Golden State Warriors
[02:38:14.640 --> 02:38:18.560]  And she doesn't know and I say warriors and she does and in fact
[02:38:18.560 --> 02:38:24.720]  That's even counterintuitive to me, and I remember it because it would seem to me that saying Golden State Warriors is more specific
[02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:31.280]  I would go so far as to say that you just say Golden State and everybody knows you know
[02:38:31.280 --> 02:38:36.960]  I would say 99% of the use of the phrase Golden State these days is specifically about the Warriors NBA team
[02:38:38.160 --> 02:38:43.440]  No, I agree and and are you be Alexis should be better it would and I'm not gonna argue with that
[02:38:43.440 --> 02:38:45.440]  I do think though. I'm gonna
[02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:49.360]  to shift the to shift the debate to my court like
[02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:56.320]  Part of this where this pays off though is the API aspect and so the API works out in two ways one
[02:38:56.320 --> 02:38:58.960]  There's there's lots of services you can add
[02:38:58.960 --> 02:39:04.960]  Like NBA scores or weather or source of stuff and it's all through the echo app and in a moment you can bitch about the echo
[02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:13.920]  App but to the way like the really exciting thing about echo is all the household stuff like like like light bulbs and and
[02:39:15.280 --> 02:39:19.200]  Air-conditioning and calling an uber and all this sort of stuff. That is
[02:39:20.160 --> 02:39:24.000]  the fact that there is an API and this respect that the
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:28.880]  Relative simplicity of Lexa and that it expects a certain order of words
[02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:35.040]  Works to its advantage because yes that puts more of a burden on the user
[02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:42.240]  But it also makes it more viable to add on lots of extra services, right? What's the problem with Siri adding on extra apps?
[02:39:42.240 --> 02:39:47.280]  It's that what's the nomenclature? How do you know that you're asking Spotify as opposed to asking Apple Music, right?
[02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:51.120]  I can say Siri play Taylor Swift and it will play
[02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:59.120]  But if it's Spotify's on there I have to have what's what's the trigger for that and and Alexa being simpler makes it more extendable
[02:39:59.760 --> 02:40:02.800]  and I'll tell you we're actually building a new house and
[02:40:03.440 --> 02:40:09.920]  I'm gonna buy everything to work with Alexa because there there's lots of products and two I'm confident it'll work
[02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:14.640]  Yeah, but Alexa can't can't
[02:40:14.640 --> 02:40:22.240]  Alexa can't connect to Spotify can can it? It can yes Spotify is on Alexa. It's it's actually this is interesting
[02:40:22.240 --> 02:40:24.240]  Where do you have to have so you have to?
[02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:26.880]  You have to add it through the extras
[02:40:28.160 --> 02:40:34.640]  Menu, so just make it like an option on Alexa and you also say like play X on Spotify if you act if you say like
[02:40:34.640 --> 02:40:38.640]  Play uptown funk. It will try to play it on Amazon Prime Music
[02:40:38.640 --> 02:40:44.080]  Without any modifier if you say play uptown funk on Spotify then it will play it via your Spotify account
[02:40:44.080 --> 02:40:48.240]  But it's only Spotify pre-mimed. The Spotify free account does not work. Huh? That's interesting
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:51.440]  I didn't know that but I don't have Spotify so it doesn't do me much different
[02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:56.160]  I'll tell you what the one thing my family has been very very nonplussed by
[02:40:57.440 --> 02:41:04.480]  By the echo and Alexa until last night when we started playing music and then it actually that was the first
[02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:12.000]  Thing that that really clicked where we could and it seemed you know
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:17.680]  I don't know that we stumped Amazon Prime Music Amazon Prime Music seems to have an awful lot of music
[02:41:17.680 --> 02:41:22.800]  We everything we were looking for. I guess the one thing we there was a live song
[02:41:24.480 --> 02:41:26.480]  We wanted to play
[02:41:26.480 --> 02:41:29.920]  It's a family favorite one of my favorites Asia's heat of the moment
[02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:37.440]  And when you ask Alexa to play it all she'll play is a live recording and there was we couldn't figure out a way to force
[02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.160]  Her to play the studio recording
[02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:44.800]  Yeah, she probably doesn't have it. Yeah, it might be it's it's fascinating though
[02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:48.960]  like my like when Mike like my kids will walk in the door and
[02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:55.200]  Immediately issue a command to Alexa like it's remarkable and and I
[02:41:55.200 --> 02:42:04.960]  I don't know. I I think this extendability and again this just take this full circle like all this podcast is actually integrated and
[02:42:05.920 --> 02:42:09.120]  If the iPhone is slowing growth like the biggest
[02:42:09.760 --> 02:42:13.520]  Opportunity for Apple to grow is services if they want to grow in services
[02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:17.600]  I would argue they have to think about the organization and how they you know
[02:42:17.600 --> 02:42:20.880]  whether that like they should kind of bifurcate it and
[02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:26.880]  By extension, if they to be effective in services it entails
[02:42:28.240 --> 02:42:31.360]  Enabling ecosystems and enabling these sort of
[02:42:32.160 --> 02:42:39.600]  Plug-and-play sort of things and it's gonna it's a challenge for Apple and this gets to like real existential questions about companies and how you build them
[02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:42.320]  And how do you balance culture versus?
[02:42:43.360 --> 02:42:46.960]  What your opportunities are and it's fascinating
[02:42:46.960 --> 02:42:52.480]  This is honestly gonna be I think the next five years or next two years are gonna be some of the most
[02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:58.080]  Absolutely fascinating years when it comes to think about Apple and their place in the world going forward. So I'm
[02:42:59.280 --> 02:43:01.280]  It's gonna be great. It's interesting
[02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:07.680]  Thinking about Syrian API's because Siri is no longer new. I mean series 2011 debuted in 2011
[02:43:07.680 --> 02:43:12.400]  So, I mean I know it's five years almost almost five years just for at least four and a half
[02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:17.120]  And you know, I think a lot of us I thought, you know an API was inevitable
[02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:22.720]  It's just of course, you know and much like the way that the iPhone shipped without third-party apps and then it came
[02:43:22.720 --> 02:43:29.520]  You know that Siri is obviously rougher around the edges than the iPhone was but give it some time and there'll be an API
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:35.040]  But now here we are in 2016 and still no API. I would love it. I I know a lot of developers would too
[02:43:35.840 --> 02:43:38.240]  I would love it. I know a lot of developers would too
[02:43:38.240 --> 02:43:41.760]  But at this point if if like this WWDC
[02:43:42.320 --> 02:43:48.000]  In six weeks comes and passes without any mention of a Siri API you really I really have to start thinking that
[02:43:48.480 --> 02:43:50.960]  Apple's strategy with Siri is that it's it's
[02:43:51.840 --> 02:43:53.840]  Proprietary and first party only
[02:43:55.280 --> 02:43:57.840]  Yeah, it's interesting. I mean
[02:43:58.720 --> 02:44:04.000]  That makes sense. I guess if you want to and if you want to put like like I said, it keeps me going
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:08.080]  Subscribe to Apple music a Siri is the reason I'm still subscribe to Apple music. Yeah
[02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:12.960]  Interesting. So anything else you want to talk about Ben? We got to wrap up and go on forever
[02:44:13.600 --> 02:44:16.960]  Well, what's the record? I think the Syracuse have the record right now, right?
[02:44:16.960 --> 02:44:23.280]  We're at two minutes and 51 seconds. So or two hours in between. I don't think anybody's gonna break Syracuse's record, Syracuse
[02:44:23.280 --> 02:44:27.600]  And I think the episode was Syracuse. It was I mean look six hours 47 minutes
[02:44:27.600 --> 02:44:34.000]  It was a six it was not six hours we had a hard limit hard limit at seven so we've wrapped up at six six hours
[02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000]  47 minutes
[02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:42.560]  We could go NBA according according. I want to talk about your podcast last week. I always love to talk MBA. Uh,
[02:44:43.680 --> 02:44:51.200]  Yeah, I mean how did you watch that that uh, the the San Antonio OKC ending that last 13 seconds?
[02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:57.760]  I did that. So San Antonio was
[02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:04.400]  Wait, did how well was the one where Dan waiters shoved managed?
[02:45:04.400 --> 02:45:09.200]  No, right from an out-of-balance position in which no one has the refs at the end
[02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:13.680]  The best part was the end of the game the rest issued an end-of-game report or they interviewed them
[02:45:13.680 --> 02:45:17.520]  They're like one we missed the call. It should have been offensive foul two
[02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:25.040]  We've never seen that before so like it was just totally understandable right ref a reffing is all almost a lot of it's about
[02:45:25.040 --> 02:45:30.160]  Anticipating stuff and when something happens you've never seen before and you're in the heat of the moment
[02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:34.560]  There's so much going on like you can't you don't even think to blow your whistle because you're like what the hell is that?
[02:45:34.560 --> 02:45:39.200]  Yeah, I mean you're a bit you're a die-hard NBA fan. I used to be more of a basketball fan
[02:45:39.200 --> 02:45:43.440]  I've really gotten into it. I feel like just because I feel like the league has is
[02:45:43.440 --> 02:45:49.200]  Having a resurgence and that there's a lot of interesting stuff going on and I've said this on the show many times before a lot
[02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:55.440]  Of times in the context of baseball, which is still my favorite sport, but that that my friend Matt Wang
[02:45:56.080 --> 02:46:00.400]  Matt if Matt's listening, I know he listens to the show, but he'll appreciate that I call him out
[02:46:00.400 --> 02:46:03.200]  But his basic idea is that there's two types of sports fans
[02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:10.320]  fundamentally story story people and stats people and that story people can still appreciate stats and the fact that
[02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:16.640]  People can still get into the stories, but there's you know, fundamentally that's there's one of the other is the reason you love sports
[02:46:16.640 --> 02:46:22.640]  And I'm a story person and to me the stories in the NBA right now are as good as they've ever been there
[02:46:22.640 --> 02:46:27.280]  it's like almost back to the heyday in the the 80s and Jordan there are 90s and
[02:46:28.080 --> 02:46:33.280]  Part of it. I agree is it's just that the way that the personalities of the superstars are so different
[02:46:33.280 --> 02:46:36.880]  You know LeBron and and Steph Curry are such different players
[02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:42.560]  It's that it makes for a compelling narrative and you've got Tim Tim Duncan wrapping up his career, etc
[02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:49.200]  But anyway, I'm one of my observations. I just want to see if you agree is that the refereeing in the playoffs so far has
[02:46:49.840 --> 02:46:56.800]  aired almost game to game on the side of no-calls like you can at the end of a game you could just
[02:46:57.200 --> 02:47:00.000]  Shoot a guy with a gun and you're not gonna get called for a foul
[02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:07.520]  So one of my guilty pleasures is the Dan LeBertard show which is like this ridiculous sports talk show from Miami
[02:47:07.520 --> 02:47:12.480]  But he is I follow him on Twitter and he he tweeted during that OKC San Antonio thing
[02:47:12.480 --> 02:47:17.360]  He's like, I think I saw a machete under the basket like it which was ridiculous
[02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:25.520]  But it captured like that last play like there was so much malfeasance happening on the court in a span of 13 seconds
[02:47:25.520 --> 02:47:30.960]  Yeah, it looked like a playground game, you know, like it just it really looked like a playground game that had gotten out of hand
[02:47:30.960 --> 02:47:35.440]  And it was like there's gotta be a foul somewhere. Like if you miss a call you miss a call
[02:47:35.440 --> 02:47:37.440]  But how can you miss all of them?
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:41.760]  So it was so great it was so great because
[02:47:42.480 --> 02:47:48.320]  Like one there was aspects of that play that captured everything about both teams like OKC
[02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:56.160]  Ran a miserable inbounds play and turned the ball over and yet they yet they their defense was incredible on that play
[02:47:56.160 --> 02:47:58.160]  The fact was Steven Adams
[02:47:58.160 --> 02:48:03.040]  blocked or contested like three different Spurs shot opportunities and they and
[02:48:03.440 --> 02:48:07.920]  Like and that's OKC, right? They suck at like organized basketball
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:14.560]  But they're so overwhelming athletically that that they make up for it and and and it's just so great
[02:48:14.560 --> 02:48:21.360]  And then there's all the debate on Twitter and there's all the vines the way the NBA has has been like post what you want on YouTube
[02:48:21.360 --> 02:48:25.280]  Post you want on Twitter and like all that sort of stuff. It's so forward-thinking and
[02:48:25.840 --> 02:48:29.440]  NBA Twitter is like the perfect manifestation of what Twitter could be
[02:48:29.840 --> 02:48:36.080]  Like when you follow the right you get in NBA Twitter and you follow the right folks and like all the debate and all the jokes
[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:38.400]  And all the memes it's incredible
[02:48:38.400 --> 02:48:40.800]  It isn't it to watch the NBA Twitter
[02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:46.560]  And it's shamefully the NBA app doesn't handle the split screen on the on the iPad, which is a bummer
[02:48:46.560 --> 02:48:50.960]  But but like the iPad is awesome because you can watch the game you have the Twitter on the side
[02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:54.800]  it's it's really is a revolutionary sort of experience and
[02:48:55.760 --> 02:48:59.040]  It really is like the best manifestation of Twitter and kind of sports
[02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:06.080]  Going forward. Yeah for anybody who's like me like my favorite U.S. pro support is being on Twitter
[02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:12.720]  My second favorite now is probably the NBA definitely the NBA and I've long resented this popularity of the NFL
[02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:15.120]  But the overwhelming popularity of the NFL
[02:49:16.320 --> 02:49:21.360]  To me the advantage is is it makes the other leagues a little bit more I think liberal with their
[02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:27.120]  Or forward-thinking with the social media, you know, like I know the MLB was you know
[02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:32.320]  Like when meerkat and periscope came out they were like, you know, I'm not gonna say that
[02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:38.160]  Like when meerkat and periscope came out they were like, yeah, sure, you know do it, you know
[02:49:38.160 --> 02:49:41.840]  Like if any you know, there's no way they just say recognize the truth
[02:49:41.840 --> 02:49:45.840]  Which is that there's no way that anybody watching the periscope of a baseball game from?
[02:49:46.240 --> 02:49:49.920]  However, good your seat is is ever going to be better than watching the actual broadcast
[02:49:50.240 --> 02:49:53.200]  So just do it and if you catch something cool, you know share it
[02:49:54.320 --> 02:49:57.840]  I definitely think that it's an advantage to be a fan of
[02:49:57.840 --> 02:50:01.760]  The not preeminent league because that the NFL is way more
[02:50:03.040 --> 02:50:05.040]  Stick up the butt about stuff like that
[02:50:06.960 --> 02:50:11.120]  So big picture let's not get specific big picture, how do you see the NBA playoffs to turn it out?
[02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:12.960]  You think what do you think they're gonna do with Steph Curry?
[02:50:14.320 --> 02:50:16.960]  I think they're gonna well, I think they're gonna sit them until
[02:50:18.560 --> 02:50:22.880]  Until they have two losses in this series and I don't think they're gonna have two losses in this series
[02:50:22.880 --> 02:50:25.600]  So I don't think we're gonna see Steph Curry play until the next series
[02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:31.680]  Yeah, I will tell you I love what this kind of period is doing for the reputation of Draymond Green like he
[02:50:32.800 --> 02:50:39.120]  That game like he's an incredible player. He really is that said there's an argument
[02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:43.680]  He said if Curry is ready like better for him to knock. He's gonna be rusty
[02:50:43.680 --> 02:50:47.600]  You saw him in the game against the Rockets better for him to knock the rust off against the Blazers
[02:50:47.600 --> 02:50:54.080]  Yeah, knock the rust off against against the Spurs because you lose one game in Oracle and like your backs are against the wall
[02:50:54.080 --> 02:51:02.560]  And so I don't know like there was a great article by Tim Grover Michael Jordan's trainer talking about the fact that
[02:51:03.120 --> 02:51:08.000]  He actually believes that Curry's knee injury was caused by his ankle. Yeah, I saw that article
[02:51:08.080 --> 02:51:14.000]  He was he was probably wearing a very a brace which transferred the kind of kinetic injury up
[02:51:14.400 --> 02:51:16.720]  kinetic energy of the slip up to his knee
[02:51:17.280 --> 02:51:21.760]  Which makes makes a ton of sense at the same time like, you know
[02:51:21.760 --> 02:51:27.520]  You got to knock off the rust at some point and and if they can handle the Blazers arguably it's better to do it there
[02:51:27.680 --> 02:51:32.800]  Yeah, then maybe he should yeah, I could see that but even so I don't I still don't think he's gonna play Saturday
[02:51:32.800 --> 02:51:39.600]  No matter what I'd say and then and so maybe they'll let him knock the rust off in game four if you know win or lose
[02:51:40.560 --> 02:51:43.120]  But you know, I I really don't think they're gonna let him play
[02:51:44.320 --> 02:51:46.880]  Play on Saturday. Um, yeah, no, I think
[02:51:46.880 --> 02:51:52.400]  I think and in ideally they bring him back and he can come in like maybe against bench units
[02:51:52.480 --> 02:51:54.320]  I would say you don't want him covering Willard, right?
[02:51:54.320 --> 02:51:59.280]  well, there's a great player and he's gonna force you into these really harsh lateral movements and
[02:52:00.320 --> 02:52:04.320]  Hopefully they can ease it back in if he's healthy. I think Golden State's the overwhelming favorite
[02:52:04.320 --> 02:52:08.800]  I think they're a bad match for San Antonio. Like they just San Antonio
[02:52:09.840 --> 02:52:14.480]  I think he's gonna have her time with those two great shooting guards and they put in the pick and roll
[02:52:14.960 --> 02:52:16.080]  uh
[02:52:16.080 --> 02:52:19.520]  If he's not healthy though, the thing with San Antonio is Danny Green
[02:52:20.240 --> 02:52:26.640]  He's shot the three terribly all year and he's been good the last couple games if he is knocking down that three
[02:52:27.040 --> 02:52:30.720]  Uh, they're they're they're a tough team. Uh, so
[02:52:31.840 --> 02:52:34.640]  I hope because I'm a story guy. Here's how I hope it plays out
[02:52:34.720 --> 02:52:38.080]  I hope it's Golden State versus San Antonio in the west and
[02:52:38.640 --> 02:52:44.400]  Just like now you've got a new podcast with a friend of the show Manton Reese, uh dedicated to basketball technical foul
[02:52:44.400 --> 02:52:46.480]  I'll put a link to it in the show notes. Good podcast
[02:52:48.720 --> 02:52:50.640]  And you guys have mentioned this that it
[02:52:50.640 --> 02:52:57.840]  What an amazing it'd be a better story in the east if it is Lebron James and the Cavs against the Miami Heat
[02:52:58.640 --> 02:53:00.640]  It would be awesome. Like it'd be awesome
[02:53:00.960 --> 02:53:05.760]  I'm, sorry if you're like a Toronto fan, you know, I mean, I know you're not gonna root for Miami
[02:53:05.760 --> 02:53:07.840]  but I mean you got to realize that everybody else is
[02:53:08.640 --> 02:53:13.680]  rooting for Miami versus the Cavaliers because man that it's playoff game
[02:53:13.680 --> 02:53:14.560]  I mean
[02:53:14.560 --> 02:53:18.720]  Lebron on the road playing in Miami in a playoff game for the eastern
[02:53:19.040 --> 02:53:25.760]  Especially because like there's still like there's still questions about Lebron's kind of mental strength, right? Right
[02:53:25.840 --> 02:53:33.060]  I mean like he's had two playoff series against Boston and against Dallas where he kind of melted down mentally
[02:53:33.360 --> 02:53:37.120]  and if he's going up against his old teammates and they're getting in his head like
[02:53:37.120 --> 02:53:44.160]  You Cleveland's the better team but you can envision a possibility where Miami wins games
[02:53:44.160 --> 02:53:48.400]  They shouldn't and Dwayne Wade has been amazing these playoffs like yeah
[02:53:49.440 --> 02:53:53.760]  He's got that look of like the elder statesman who's in the last gasp of his
[02:53:54.560 --> 02:53:56.720]  like preeminence athletically and
[02:53:57.280 --> 02:54:00.480]  But but can still but his smarts compensate for it
[02:54:01.040 --> 02:54:04.240]  Right. It's sort of like like late era Jordan on the Bulls
[02:54:04.240 --> 02:54:08.720]  You know that you could tell you could tell he's lost his step but or half a step
[02:54:08.720 --> 02:54:15.680]  but he makes up for the half step mentally like the I mean the greatest example is the time Jordan stole the ball from
[02:54:16.560 --> 02:54:23.040]  Malone Malone, yeah, it's just is he just knew you just see he knew exactly what Malone was gonna do and his hand was there
[02:54:23.840 --> 02:54:26.640]  We got a wrap-up. But the other thing too is you because you don't watch baseball
[02:54:26.640 --> 02:54:31.120]  Did you I'll put this in the show notes, but you know, clay Thompson speaking of the Warriors, you know
[02:54:31.120 --> 02:54:34.320]  Speaking of the Warriors, you know, his brother's a baseball player, right?
[02:54:35.040 --> 02:54:40.000]  Yeah, why the reason I know about it is because I think he says something in his press conference after a recent game about his brother
[02:54:40.080 --> 02:54:45.600]  Just crushed the ball or something. Well, his brother is a trace Thompson plays for the Dodgers and the Dodgers were playing
[02:54:46.880 --> 02:54:47.760]  the
[02:54:47.760 --> 02:54:50.960]  Tampa Bay Rays which is interesting because it's interleague baseball
[02:54:51.200 --> 02:54:56.240]  Interleague is you don't play America in the National League and other than the rivals that are in the same town
[02:54:56.320 --> 02:55:00.260]  You don't play every year. So the Dodgers hadn't been to Tampa Bay since like 2007
[02:55:00.260 --> 02:55:06.340]  So it's a rare thing for the Dodgers to be playing in Tampa Bay and Tampa Bay has the worst baseball
[02:55:07.140 --> 02:55:11.620]  Stadium in ever in Major League Baseball. It's this horrible dome
[02:55:12.180 --> 02:55:17.700]  Called Tropicana Field Paul kafassus and I went there last year just to see it because they're good
[02:55:17.700 --> 02:55:21.700]  They've got to close it soon. It's horrible. It's a dome it is ugly
[02:55:22.180 --> 02:55:26.820]  It it smells bad smells like the like like you're in like a Sam's Club or something like that
[02:55:26.820 --> 02:55:33.380]  Then and it's actually physically it should be illegal. It's like the the dome isn't high enough
[02:55:33.460 --> 02:55:37.540]  So balls get caught up in the rafters all the time and there's all sorts of rules. There's like
[02:55:38.180 --> 02:55:40.580]  different tier the the the the
[02:55:41.140 --> 02:55:43.060]  What I call the field rules
[02:55:43.060 --> 02:55:45.060]  are so
[02:55:45.860 --> 02:55:48.980]  There's like this whole book of rules of if a ball hits this rafter
[02:55:49.220 --> 02:55:53.140]  It's in play so you can hit it and then if a guy catches it it's an out
[02:55:53.140 --> 02:56:00.260]  And if it hits these rafters this this or this it's a home run. And so his brother hit a ball that disappeared
[02:56:00.260 --> 02:56:04.980]  It just went up into the rafters and never came down and but it was the rule the whole app
[02:56:05.220 --> 02:56:08.600]  Properly because it would have been over the fence in any other stadium, but it just disappeared
[02:56:10.980 --> 02:56:17.780]  Which is it just all even in their crap field almost never happens that the ball just doesn't come down and the next day he
[02:56:17.780 --> 02:56:19.380]  Wanted to go up and find it
[02:56:19.380 --> 02:56:23.940]  He wanted to see if he could go up and find it in the rafters and he wasn't allowed to because he was told that
[02:56:23.940 --> 02:56:25.940]  They're they're not safe
[02:56:26.820 --> 02:56:32.260]  Like the field is so janky that they thought that if if he went up there maybe the rafters will collapse
[02:56:33.220 --> 02:56:36.260]  I thought I thought that was a funny story and a nice crossover between
[02:56:37.300 --> 02:56:38.980]  baseball and basketball
[02:56:38.980 --> 02:56:41.380]  All right, let's wrap it up the baseball ben thompson
[02:56:42.100 --> 02:56:45.620]  We cross the three-hour mark. I feel I I think this is the first time we've crossed the three-hour mark
[02:56:45.620 --> 02:56:49.540]  So I feel accomplished. Let's see what comes out in the editing. But yeah, probably um
[02:56:50.340 --> 02:56:56.600]  Your excellent daily update at uh, stratechery is uh, what's the website stratechery.com?
[02:56:56.900 --> 02:56:58.000]  yeah, so
[02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:03.060]  Stratechery.com has one free article a week and then uh, uh, I will mail you something
[02:57:03.380 --> 02:57:10.100]  Uh an additional three days a week if well worth it. It is your cash. Honestly. Anybody who enjoys ben on the show it is
[02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:14.180]  Enormously, uh worth the money. It's a great value

[02:57:36.980 --> 02:57:40.820]  Uh, which I now still control but I don't tweet from it anymore

[02:57:46.580 --> 02:57:51.060]  Uh more in line with the talk show, you know tech talking about tech and stuff like that at exponent fm
[02:57:51.300 --> 02:57:56.980]  But more importantly for this playoff stretch, you've got the uh technical foul podcast with uh, manton
[02:57:57.460 --> 02:58:00.420]  And that's at uh, what'd you say technical foul fm?
[02:58:01.220 --> 02:58:06.180]  Yep, technical file fm get it technical foul because they're they're like two tech guys
