[00:00.000 --> 00:04.400]  Neelay, we always talk once a year on my show.
[00:04.400 --> 00:05.800]  This is one of my favorite traditions,
[00:05.800 --> 00:08.000]  is a post-iPhone review kuber hang.
[00:08.000 --> 00:10.400]  It's a little late, but you know,
[00:10.400 --> 00:13.840]  the Apple schedule on the phone skips around,
[00:13.840 --> 00:16.560]  September, October, whatever, you know.
[00:16.560 --> 00:20.120]  There's also just a lot to talk about besides the phones.
[00:20.120 --> 00:22.440]  There's an endless amount of Apple stuff going on.
[00:22.440 --> 00:23.440]  Yeah, there really is.
[00:23.440 --> 00:26.040]  I'm curious, though, and it's kind of interesting,
[00:26.040 --> 00:28.280]  I always like the,
[00:28.280 --> 00:30.760]  I shouldn't say that I like the cool-off period.
[00:30.760 --> 00:33.360]  It's that I hate the,
[00:33.360 --> 00:35.560]  okay, you have six days to review this phone
[00:36.640 --> 00:40.960]  and try not to miss anything and try to let it settle in.
[00:40.960 --> 00:43.620]  It's interesting to me to keep talking about it.
[00:43.620 --> 00:46.480]  This, to me, is why podcasts are awesome.
[00:46.480 --> 00:50.040]  After the iPhone 13s are,
[00:50.040 --> 00:52.580]  not necessarily old news, but you know,
[00:52.580 --> 00:54.120]  they're not the hot freshest.
[00:54.120 --> 00:56.200]  I'm curious what you think overall.
[00:56.200 --> 00:58.400]  I think, I mean, they're great phones.
[00:58.400 --> 01:01.440]  And, you know, there's that debate about the names
[01:01.440 --> 01:03.080]  and whether they should have called them the 12s.
[01:03.080 --> 01:03.920]  Right.
[01:03.920 --> 01:08.360]  And my big takeaway is that it, in many ways,
[01:08.360 --> 01:10.240]  for one particular reason, which I'll say,
[01:10.240 --> 01:12.520]  this is the phone the 12 should have been.
[01:12.520 --> 01:14.480]  And like, I think calling it the 12s
[01:14.480 --> 01:16.920]  would have made that making more clear,
[01:16.920 --> 01:19.400]  but it's a great phone, and the 12 was a great phone.
[01:19.400 --> 01:20.600]  I really liked that phone.
[01:20.600 --> 01:22.400]  The specific thing I'm getting at is
[01:22.400 --> 01:24.640]  the 5G performance of this phone appears to be
[01:24.640 --> 01:26.600]  better than the 12 where I live,
[01:26.600 --> 01:28.560]  which is a really hard thing to talk about.
[01:28.560 --> 01:29.400]  Right.
[01:29.400 --> 01:31.640]  Because other people had great 5G experiences
[01:31.640 --> 01:33.280]  with their 12 wherever they live.
[01:33.280 --> 01:36.600]  But for me, where I live in the middle of nowhere,
[01:36.600 --> 01:39.880]  the 5G performance on the 13 Pro Max
[01:39.880 --> 01:43.240]  is significantly better than the 12.
[01:43.240 --> 01:46.640]  And I'm assuming AT&T didn't put up a tower yesterday
[01:46.640 --> 01:48.960]  to make that the case, especially where I live.
[01:48.960 --> 01:50.720]  So there's just all this stuff
[01:50.720 --> 01:52.480]  that you start to notice over time.
[01:52.480 --> 01:53.320]  Yeah.
[01:53.320 --> 01:54.720]  That you would never catch.
[01:54.720 --> 01:57.760]  And I think the 12 came out with that wave of 5G hype.
[01:57.760 --> 01:59.760]  They had Verizon on stage,
[01:59.760 --> 02:02.800]  and it kind of fell flat for a lot of people.
[02:02.800 --> 02:05.200]  And this phone actually delivers on that set of hype.
[02:05.200 --> 02:06.760]  So that's, when I say it's the phone
[02:06.760 --> 02:07.920]  that the 12 should have been,
[02:07.920 --> 02:10.080]  it's the phone that to me, for the first time,
[02:10.080 --> 02:12.200]  delivers any true value out of 5G.
[02:12.200 --> 02:15.920]  Where on LTE or on the 12 with 5G,
[02:15.920 --> 02:17.880]  I was getting like 25 down here,
[02:17.880 --> 02:21.080]  my 13 will get 100 down, which is a massive increase.
[02:21.080 --> 02:23.240]  Yeah, that's a super, that's a huge increase.
[02:23.240 --> 02:24.640]  Super significant.
[02:24.640 --> 02:27.160]  Because I would say 100 is sort of where,
[02:27.160 --> 02:28.960]  it's not necessarily super fast,
[02:28.960 --> 02:32.880]  but that's sort of, in today's world, that's pretty decent.
[02:32.880 --> 02:34.720]  You know, whether you're on Wi-Fi or cellular,
[02:34.720 --> 02:37.760]  100 megabits per second down, it's pretty good.
[02:37.760 --> 02:40.120]  You can stream whatever you want.
[02:40.120 --> 02:42.800]  If you're downloading something truly humongous,
[02:42.800 --> 02:45.880]  like if you're tethering and using it
[02:45.880 --> 02:48.120]  to download the new Xcode to your Mac,
[02:48.120 --> 02:50.480]  and it's multiple gigabytes, sure,
[02:50.480 --> 02:52.480]  maybe it's not that fast, but it's pretty good.
[02:52.480 --> 02:54.560]  At 25, on the other hand, you're probably gonna struggle
[02:54.560 --> 02:58.160]  to pull down 4K video or something like that.
[02:58.160 --> 03:00.320]  Yeah, and all the people in Europe and South Korea
[03:00.320 --> 03:02.000]  are laughing, the two Americans.
[03:02.000 --> 03:02.840]  100 is great.
[03:02.840 --> 03:05.080]  They've been getting 100 on LTE for 10 years.
[03:06.040 --> 03:07.000]  I can't complain.
[03:07.000 --> 03:08.520]  Here in Philadelphia, Verizon,
[03:08.520 --> 03:11.800]  in Center City, Philadelphia, Verizon has been really good.
[03:11.800 --> 03:14.520]  I mean, I think I tend to get like 200
[03:14.520 --> 03:17.160]  on LTE most of the time.
[03:17.160 --> 03:21.800]  And I did get the super fast 5G, UW,
[03:21.800 --> 03:23.760]  just a few blocks from my house,
[03:23.760 --> 03:27.320]  and Verizon's map was super accurate.
[03:27.320 --> 03:30.020]  Like, it was like, okay, if I go to this weird corner,
[03:30.020 --> 03:31.680]  which is not even like a busy street,
[03:31.680 --> 03:35.800]  they're saying I'm gonna get 5G, UW, ultrawide,
[03:35.800 --> 03:37.280]  and it's like, boom, there I do,
[03:37.280 --> 03:40.200]  almost 2,000 megabits per second.
[03:40.200 --> 03:42.080]  Well, in Philly, Comcast is in Philly, right?
[03:42.080 --> 03:43.720]  And Comcast has partnered with Verizon
[03:43.720 --> 03:46.040]  on their weird Xfinity.
[03:46.040 --> 03:47.920]  And so you have to imagine the Comcast executives
[03:47.920 --> 03:49.560]  are walking around being like, yo,
[03:49.560 --> 03:50.760]  can you get to work here?
[03:50.760 --> 03:53.520]  Like, we run a network, like, we can help you.
[03:53.520 --> 03:55.120]  Not so much in the woods, right?
[03:55.120 --> 03:59.920]  But I will say that over a year of iPhone 12 use,
[03:59.920 --> 04:02.400]  I went back and forth all year long
[04:02.400 --> 04:05.340]  whether I should just turn off 5G and just use LTE,
[04:05.340 --> 04:09.120]  because I vaguely suspected that I was squandering battery
[04:09.120 --> 04:11.500]  all year for no real use,
[04:11.500 --> 04:15.160]  because if I was gonna get 200 megabits down
[04:15.160 --> 04:17.920]  or close to it on LTE, what's the point?
[04:17.920 --> 04:21.320]  If the regular 5G is around the same,
[04:21.320 --> 04:23.560]  anyway, it can only save battery.
[04:23.560 --> 04:25.760]  But the other thing was that for the whole year
[04:25.760 --> 04:27.680]  I was using the iPhone 12, for the most part,
[04:27.680 --> 04:29.880]  I never really went anywhere, you know?
[04:29.880 --> 04:32.960]  So it was like, in a normal year
[04:32.960 --> 04:35.120]  where I was traveling several times a year,
[04:35.120 --> 04:37.320]  would have been traveling like, you know,
[04:37.320 --> 04:42.000]  probably this coming weekend for the Mac event next week,
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.480]  et cetera, I always am interested in things like,
[04:46.480 --> 04:48.240]  hey, this new technology,
[04:48.240 --> 04:50.600]  like when the phones first went to LTE,
[04:50.600 --> 04:52.680]  it was like, nah, keep it on 3G when you travel,
[04:52.680 --> 04:53.680]  because you're not gonna get the speed.
[04:53.680 --> 04:56.440]  You know, the first few years of these network rollouts
[04:56.440 --> 04:57.980]  never really pay off anyway.
[04:59.240 --> 05:00.740]  Yeah, but that's what I mean.
[05:00.740 --> 05:03.580]  The 5G hype cycle was out of control,
[05:03.580 --> 05:07.040]  and the 12 was like, I mean, right there,
[05:07.040 --> 05:09.040]  like 5G got real, it's really here now
[05:09.040 --> 05:11.480]  because of this phone, and that, to me,
[05:11.480 --> 05:13.680]  just never connected, it never landed.
[05:13.680 --> 05:15.160]  And then with this phone, I'm like, okay,
[05:15.160 --> 05:16.560]  I'm starting to see it.
[05:16.560 --> 05:19.280]  I think there is, the radios are slightly different,
[05:19.280 --> 05:22.040]  they can access more bands.
[05:22.040 --> 05:23.960]  AT&T and Verizon are, you know,
[05:23.960 --> 05:25.680]  they've been aggressively lying
[05:25.680 --> 05:28.320]  about what 5G means for some time.
[05:28.320 --> 05:32.700]  AT&T in particular, AT&T takes it to a new level,
[05:32.700 --> 05:35.360]  and they did the same thing with 4G too, right?
[05:35.360 --> 05:38.120]  Where they had, you know, and they convinced Apple
[05:38.120 --> 05:40.960]  to put like a weird icon up in the status bar
[05:40.960 --> 05:43.860]  with, you know, like 5G with an asterisk
[05:43.860 --> 05:45.080]  or something like that.
[05:45.080 --> 05:46.720]  Yeah, so it was 5G for AT&T,
[05:46.720 --> 05:48.160]  but the other thing they're doing,
[05:48.160 --> 05:50.920]  which, you know, it's like, it makes sense
[05:50.920 --> 05:54.320]  they would try to do this, but they're reusing
[05:54.320 --> 05:57.280]  and sharing LTE spectrum with 5G spectrum.
[05:57.280 --> 05:59.800]  It's called DSS, and it's this weird technology,
[05:59.800 --> 06:01.560]  and I would, when the 12 came out,
[06:01.560 --> 06:03.680]  I said, how often is this phone using DSS
[06:03.680 --> 06:05.720]  versus dedicated 5G spectrum?
[06:05.720 --> 06:07.160]  And there was a lot of hemming and hawing,
[06:07.160 --> 06:09.840]  and they're like, that's up to the carrier's gonna ask them.
[06:09.840 --> 06:11.360]  And now that it supports more bands,
[06:11.360 --> 06:13.640]  and they're rolling out more of that mid-band 5G,
[06:13.640 --> 06:16.840]  which is the reason T-Mobile has had a faster network
[06:16.840 --> 06:18.960]  this whole time is they've always had the mid-band 5G
[06:18.960 --> 06:21.440]  as opposed to the millimeter wave.
[06:21.440 --> 06:24.120]  You can see it, and right, is it the phone?
[06:24.120 --> 06:24.960]  Is it the carrier?
[06:24.960 --> 06:26.240]  Is it the phone supports more bands?
[06:26.240 --> 06:28.760]  Like it's, this is why it's,
[06:28.760 --> 06:31.000]  I would have never been able to put this all in a review.
[06:31.000 --> 06:33.720]  I would have written an 8,000-word review,
[06:33.720 --> 06:35.600]  or actually this year Dieter did the reviews.
[06:35.600 --> 06:37.720]  I would have made Dieter write an 8,000-word review
[06:37.720 --> 06:41.440]  on just frequency allocations and the phone,
[06:41.440 --> 06:43.760]  but I wouldn't, I don't think that we would have even known
[06:43.760 --> 06:45.240]  without this much more time passing
[06:45.240 --> 06:47.640]  and being able to say, okay, I'm starting to see
[06:47.640 --> 06:49.400]  that the phone is caught up to the network,
[06:49.400 --> 06:50.640]  has caught up to the phone,
[06:50.640 --> 06:53.440]  and that cycle is beginning to build to something useful.
[06:53.440 --> 06:57.240]  Now, do I think that I would accept a robotic surgery
[06:57.240 --> 07:00.280]  on this network or let a car drive itself on it?
[07:00.280 --> 07:01.120]  No, I would not.
[07:01.120 --> 07:02.920]  And that, like that part of the 5G hype cycle
[07:02.920 --> 07:04.080]  is out of control.
[07:04.080 --> 07:05.640]  But is it a little faster?
[07:05.640 --> 07:06.560]  It sure is.
[07:06.560 --> 07:11.200]  It is one of the most interesting and unique aspects
[07:11.200 --> 07:14.840]  of reviewing any phone, but iPhone in particular,
[07:14.840 --> 07:19.840]  because it's the one thing that is outside Apple's control
[07:21.480 --> 07:26.400]  and is obviously a very touchy subject with the carriers.
[07:26.400 --> 07:30.800]  So Apple is in this untenable position, really,
[07:30.800 --> 07:32.160]  where they, what are they gonna do?
[07:32.160 --> 07:33.280]  Tell you that, hey, well,
[07:33.280 --> 07:36.560]  Verizon has a better 5G network than AT&T,
[07:36.560 --> 07:38.240]  or vice versa, whatever.
[07:38.240 --> 07:39.080]  They're not gonna do that.
[07:39.080 --> 07:39.960]  They can't, right?
[07:39.960 --> 07:42.440]  They can't throw any of their carrier partners
[07:42.440 --> 07:46.960]  under the bus and talk about problems or say that,
[07:46.960 --> 07:50.680]  well, it's not gonna be as good on Carrier X
[07:50.680 --> 07:53.680]  because they don't support the band that's better,
[07:53.680 --> 07:54.520]  blah, blah, blah.
[07:54.520 --> 07:55.360]  They can't talk about it.
[07:55.360 --> 07:57.360]  But yet, it's this thing that they want to hype
[07:57.360 --> 08:00.360]  because the carriers want to hype it.
[08:00.360 --> 08:01.320]  I think especially this year,
[08:01.320 --> 08:04.640]  if you look at the pricing of these phones,
[08:04.640 --> 08:09.640]  it's almost useless to talk about the MSRP of the phone
[08:10.560 --> 08:13.320]  because the carriers are just gonna give you money,
[08:13.320 --> 08:17.680]  and that money is baked back into a more expensive 5G plan.
[08:17.680 --> 08:19.760]  The carriers are not, they're good at this math.
[08:19.760 --> 08:21.000]  Like, it's a shell game.
[08:21.000 --> 08:22.600]  They're good at it.
[08:22.600 --> 08:24.600]  The vibe we got when the phone was announced was,
[08:24.600 --> 08:28.000]  man, we are right back to the days of phone subsidies, right?
[08:28.000 --> 08:32.120]  Where we're giving the phones away for free or super cheap,
[08:32.120 --> 08:34.640]  and then we're baking that cost back into the plan,
[08:34.640 --> 08:35.520]  and we kind of know it,
[08:35.520 --> 08:38.360]  but we need the carriers to sell iPhones.
[08:38.360 --> 08:39.640]  Like, people are at home.
[08:39.640 --> 08:41.680]  Like, they're not necessarily incentivized,
[08:41.680 --> 08:43.400]  but offering people a ton of free phones
[08:43.400 --> 08:44.620]  is getting them to upgrade.
[08:44.620 --> 08:46.360]  We're managing our demand that way,
[08:46.360 --> 08:49.360]  and I think a lot of people are happy to see a free phone.
[08:49.360 --> 08:52.680]  But it's true that Apple needs the carriers to participate
[08:52.680 --> 08:56.760]  in this pretty intense subsidy program.
[08:56.760 --> 08:58.280]  The carriers want 5G phones.
[08:58.280 --> 08:59.360]  They want to switch over that network
[08:59.360 --> 09:01.120]  and get away from DSS as fast as they can.
[09:01.120 --> 09:02.120]  Apple wants to sell a lot of phones.
[09:02.120 --> 09:04.680]  So there's, I don't know if it's untenable.
[09:04.680 --> 09:06.680]  Apple's selling a lot of phones,
[09:06.680 --> 09:09.320]  but there's a part of the business relationship
[09:09.320 --> 09:11.720]  that absolutely prevents them
[09:11.720 --> 09:13.640]  from evaluating the carriers to the customer.
[09:13.640 --> 09:14.840]  They're just not gonna do that.
[09:14.840 --> 09:17.200]  I guess it is tenable in that way,
[09:17.200 --> 09:20.360]  but it's untenable in Apple's usual way
[09:20.360 --> 09:23.400]  of being as forthcoming as they can
[09:23.400 --> 09:26.100]  about the product's performance, you know?
[09:26.100 --> 09:29.460]  And you have to learn to speak Applese.
[09:29.460 --> 09:31.000]  They never throw anything under the bus.
[09:31.000 --> 09:33.560]  So here's one simple example.
[09:33.560 --> 09:38.520]  All of the iPhone 13s have an ultra-wide camera,
[09:38.520 --> 09:41.200]  but this year, the 13 Pros
[09:41.200 --> 09:44.400]  have a significantly improved ultra-wide.
[09:44.400 --> 09:46.240]  It's the one that it has autofocus,
[09:46.240 --> 09:48.440]  and that's what enables macro mode,
[09:48.440 --> 09:51.120]  and it also has a better sensor.
[09:51.120 --> 09:53.920]  Well, I guess that's partly why it has autofocus,
[09:53.920 --> 09:57.500]  better sensor, but it's also better in low light.
[09:57.500 --> 09:59.100]  But when you ask them questions
[09:59.100 --> 10:02.760]  about the regular iPhone 13 ultra-wide in comparison,
[10:02.760 --> 10:06.260]  they don't say bad things about that lens.
[10:06.260 --> 10:09.160]  They'll only say good things about the 13 Pro lens,
[10:09.160 --> 10:12.080]  and you just have to learn to translate that,
[10:12.080 --> 10:14.600]  okay, no, the light sensitivity hasn't changed at all
[10:14.600 --> 10:15.500]  from the iPhone 12.
[10:15.500 --> 10:18.000]  That's what they're trying to say.
[10:18.000 --> 10:21.480]  But they can't talk even in their usual elliptical way
[10:21.480 --> 10:23.280]  about 5G performance.
[10:23.280 --> 10:26.280]  It is like a black box that they really can't
[10:26.280 --> 10:28.440]  because it's so tied to the promotion.
[10:28.440 --> 10:30.480]  But it is true, too.
[10:30.480 --> 10:34.120]  Right after the event, I have a friend who's,
[10:34.120 --> 10:36.440]  I guess you would best describe as an analyst,
[10:36.440 --> 10:38.320]  somebody I know through Daring Fireball,
[10:38.320 --> 10:42.880]  and he was just like, we, it's like back to 2008 with 2009
[10:42.880 --> 10:45.160]  with the subsidy model for pricing,
[10:45.160 --> 10:49.440]  and except now it's sort of, it's like inverted
[10:49.440 --> 10:53.960]  where back then, the subsidized prices were the prices
[10:53.960 --> 10:56.680]  that Apple would put up on the keynote slides,
[10:56.680 --> 10:58.200]  and they were the ones they wanted you to think
[10:58.200 --> 11:00.560]  of the real price, whereas now they tell you
[11:00.560 --> 11:05.240]  just the flat retail price and the subsidized prices
[11:05.240 --> 11:08.080]  that most people are actually paying when they go in
[11:08.080 --> 11:11.020]  and upgrade at their carrier at significant discounts,
[11:11.020 --> 11:12.080]  but who knows what they are.
[11:12.080 --> 11:14.760]  It's all sort of, and I think the carriers sort of like it
[11:14.760 --> 11:17.680]  that way where it's sort of, they don't really want you
[11:17.680 --> 11:19.820]  pricing, you know, shopping it around.
[11:19.820 --> 11:20.940]  It is so hard.
[11:21.800 --> 11:23.320]  Apple did put up two slides.
[11:23.320 --> 11:25.160]  They showed you the MSRP this year,
[11:25.160 --> 11:26.400]  and then I think there was a second slide
[11:26.400 --> 11:28.520]  where they're like, we're so excited our carrier partners
[11:28.520 --> 11:30.240]  are gonna offer these discounts.
[11:30.240 --> 11:32.720]  So it was a little change, but then you,
[11:32.720 --> 11:34.640]  we just tried to do a story where we're like,
[11:34.640 --> 11:37.240]  here's how much the iPhone costs this year,
[11:37.240 --> 11:39.120]  and we just tried to break down all the carriers,
[11:39.120 --> 11:40.880]  and it quickly got out of hand.
[11:40.880 --> 11:43.680]  Like we realized what we needed to build
[11:43.680 --> 11:45.840]  was effectively a search engine,
[11:45.840 --> 11:48.420]  like a Google-caliber search engine
[11:48.420 --> 11:51.240]  where you typed in the plan you had,
[11:51.240 --> 11:53.840]  and every carrier now has like decades worth
[11:53.840 --> 11:57.700]  of weird grandfathered plans, the phone you had
[11:57.700 --> 11:59.440]  that you're trading, and like, we're like,
[11:59.440 --> 12:02.960]  the literal logic of this is a search engine.
[12:02.960 --> 12:04.520]  Like that's kind of what we're doing here.
[12:04.520 --> 12:05.920]  Like we don't know if we can do this.
[12:05.920 --> 12:08.060]  The one I saw, there's a bunch of YouTube videos
[12:08.060 --> 12:11.520]  where like YouTubers are doing Excel on YouTube,
[12:11.520 --> 12:14.640]  and I wanna, when you get the YouTubers to start
[12:14.640 --> 12:16.280]  like doing Excel on camera, you know,
[12:16.280 --> 12:18.440]  like maybe this is a little too complicated.
[12:18.440 --> 12:23.440]  It is not the most cinematic way of presenting information,
[12:25.480 --> 12:29.720]  but there are some things that demand a tabular grid.
[12:29.720 --> 12:31.400]  It's interesting.
[12:31.400 --> 12:33.200]  I think the other thing that's interesting
[12:33.200 --> 12:35.280]  with the iPhone 13 models,
[12:35.280 --> 12:38.200]  and it ties into the Apple Watch Series 7,
[12:38.200 --> 12:40.420]  which we can pick up after a break,
[12:40.420 --> 12:45.420]  but is the lack of neutral color options
[12:45.420 --> 12:48.180]  at the consumer side.
[12:48.180 --> 12:53.180]  There's the Starlight, which is the closest they come
[12:53.740 --> 12:56.060]  to what was always just called silver,
[12:56.060 --> 12:58.980]  and Midnight, which is the closest they come
[12:58.980 --> 13:02.100]  to like a black or space gray or space black,
[13:02.100 --> 13:03.900]  those names that they've used over the years
[13:03.900 --> 13:04.820]  that have always been neutral,
[13:04.820 --> 13:06.920]  but Midnight has a touch of blue.
[13:08.740 --> 13:13.020]  And it's, I've been, again, it's a privilege.
[13:13.020 --> 13:14.300]  I love my job.
[13:14.300 --> 13:17.500]  I know it will come back to normal eventually,
[13:17.500 --> 13:20.820]  but I really, really miss the hands-on areas
[13:20.820 --> 13:23.120]  after the events.
[13:23.120 --> 13:25.300]  And I always thought it was interesting
[13:25.300 --> 13:28.020]  for evaluating color and finishes.
[13:29.780 --> 13:32.120]  I always bring up the iPhone 7,
[13:32.120 --> 13:35.020]  which is when they had oddly two black models.
[13:35.020 --> 13:38.300]  They had like a matte black and they called one jet black.
[13:38.300 --> 13:41.300]  And the jet black was the sort of thing
[13:41.300 --> 13:43.500]  that it's like impossible to photograph.
[13:43.500 --> 13:46.220]  You can't really capture gloss
[13:46.220 --> 13:50.100]  when you're displaying it on a photograph.
[13:50.100 --> 13:51.320]  You really needed to see it.
[13:51.320 --> 13:53.160]  You needed to touch it to see how it felt,
[13:53.160 --> 13:55.500]  that it had like a sort of tackiness,
[13:55.500 --> 13:58.160]  like I always say, like a basketball sneaker
[13:58.160 --> 14:00.640]  on a clean basketball court.
[14:00.640 --> 14:02.180]  With these colors this year,
[14:03.900 --> 14:05.620]  some of the feedback I've gotten from readers
[14:05.620 --> 14:07.140]  is, well, you're not talking about the colors.
[14:07.140 --> 14:08.620]  And it's like, well, I can't talk about colors
[14:08.620 --> 14:09.800]  I haven't seen, right?
[14:09.800 --> 14:12.300]  It's like, we all see Apple's photos.
[14:12.300 --> 14:14.100]  You can see them as well as I do.
[14:14.100 --> 14:15.180]  I haven't seen them in person.
[14:15.180 --> 14:17.740]  I only have the things that they've sent me
[14:17.740 --> 14:18.600]  because they're not it.
[14:18.600 --> 14:21.540]  Now I have been to the Apple store to see the phones.
[14:21.540 --> 14:23.860]  And so I've seen Starlight in person.
[14:25.180 --> 14:28.740]  I find that the Starlight is very champagne.
[14:28.740 --> 14:33.540]  It is clearly more like a silvery gold
[14:33.540 --> 14:35.820]  than a gold silver to me.
[14:35.820 --> 14:40.180]  Whereas Midnight plays as black or neutral
[14:40.180 --> 14:42.420]  and you really kind of, you have to catch it the right way
[14:42.420 --> 14:43.540]  to get the blue.
[14:43.540 --> 14:45.540]  Now, is that me?
[14:45.540 --> 14:50.540]  Is that the way my rods and cones in my eyes perceive color?
[14:50.980 --> 14:52.180]  But I know that there's a lot of,
[14:52.180 --> 14:54.060]  it's like the number one complaint about the watches
[14:54.060 --> 14:58.140]  seems to be the lack of neutral colors
[14:58.140 --> 15:00.260]  and the same thing with the phones.
[15:00.260 --> 15:01.700]  Yeah, it's interesting.
[15:01.700 --> 15:03.820]  There's a split there between the watch and the phones
[15:03.820 --> 15:06.540]  that is kind of interesting.
[15:06.540 --> 15:10.580]  I think Apple assumes and the carriers assume rightfully
[15:10.580 --> 15:13.660]  that most people are putting these in cases.
[15:13.660 --> 15:16.060]  So the colors are almost secondary.
[15:16.060 --> 15:18.380]  Like really you're picking the color of your camera bump
[15:18.380 --> 15:19.700]  because that's the only thing you're gonna see
[15:19.700 --> 15:20.980]  in most of these cases.
[15:22.180 --> 15:25.340]  I had the Sierra Blue review unit
[15:25.340 --> 15:28.180]  and I bought my own Graphite Pro.
[15:28.180 --> 15:30.580]  Sierra Blue's beautiful,
[15:30.580 --> 15:33.120]  but I instantly put it into a case.
[15:33.120 --> 15:35.840]  Yeah, so that's interesting
[15:35.840 --> 15:37.920]  because with the phones you expect,
[15:37.920 --> 15:38.800]  I think they expect it,
[15:38.800 --> 15:41.440]  they can be a little more dramatic with the colors.
[15:41.440 --> 15:42.840]  Not so with the watch, right?
[15:42.840 --> 15:45.720]  Like not very many people put the watch in cases
[15:45.720 --> 15:48.600]  and I'd be curious to understand
[15:48.600 --> 15:50.200]  why they went that way with the watch
[15:50.200 --> 15:54.760]  instead of the offering the neutral so you could,
[15:54.760 --> 15:56.800]  I mean, right now I have a black watch.
[15:56.800 --> 15:59.080]  It's like, I'm not gonna not buy a black watch.
[15:59.080 --> 16:00.600]  Right.
[16:00.600 --> 16:01.840]  Well, let me take a break
[16:01.840 --> 16:04.440]  and then we can talk about Apple Watch Series 7.
[16:04.440 --> 16:06.080]  It's a great segue.
[16:06.080 --> 16:07.440]  Let me tell you about our sponsor.
[16:07.440 --> 16:09.800]  This sponsor used to sponsor the show all the time.
[16:09.800 --> 16:10.880]  They are back.
[16:10.880 --> 16:11.980]  I love them.
[16:11.980 --> 16:14.740]  Backblaze, get peace of mind knowing your files
[16:14.740 --> 16:18.200]  are backed up securely in the cloud with Backblaze.
[16:18.200 --> 16:22.360]  Seven bucks a month, no gimmicks, no add-ons, no gotchas.
[16:22.360 --> 16:26.820]  It's unlimited backup for Mac and PC.
[16:26.820 --> 16:29.600]  Everything on your Mac, your movies, your music,
[16:29.600 --> 16:33.040]  your photos, videos, your projects, all the data.
[16:33.040 --> 16:34.820]  They have over an exabyte.
[16:34.820 --> 16:35.920]  I don't even know how big that is,
[16:35.920 --> 16:38.640]  but it must be huge because Backblaze is very popular.
[16:38.640 --> 16:39.800]  They've been around for a while.
[16:39.800 --> 16:42.460]  That's how much they've got backed up and counting.
[16:42.460 --> 16:46.680]  They say that is one billion gigabytes.
[16:46.680 --> 16:48.160]  That's what an exabyte is.
[16:48.160 --> 16:49.040]  It's a lot.
[16:49.040 --> 16:52.880]  They have restored over 55 billion files
[16:52.880 --> 16:55.960]  for customers around the world over the years.
[16:55.960 --> 16:57.720]  And they offer some great features.
[16:57.720 --> 16:59.360]  Web restore is the easiest thing.
[16:59.360 --> 17:02.240]  You just log in to their website with your credentials.
[17:02.240 --> 17:04.920]  You can get any of your files from any other computer,
[17:04.920 --> 17:06.280]  even if it's not like a backup,
[17:06.280 --> 17:08.320]  like, oh, something terrible happened to my file.
[17:08.320 --> 17:10.640]  Even if you're just like away from home
[17:10.640 --> 17:13.960]  and want to access something on a Backblaze backed up Mac,
[17:13.960 --> 17:15.320]  you can do it over the web.
[17:15.320 --> 17:17.080]  But let's say catastrophe hits.
[17:17.080 --> 17:19.480]  You need the whole drive sent to you.
[17:19.480 --> 17:22.400]  You don't want to wait for it to download.
[17:22.400 --> 17:24.040]  You can get it restored by mail.
[17:24.040 --> 17:25.980]  They'll put it on a flash key or a hard drive,
[17:25.980 --> 17:27.600]  ship it right to your door,
[17:27.600 --> 17:30.720]  and then you just restore it, send the drive back to them,
[17:30.720 --> 17:32.040]  and you get a full refund for it.
[17:32.040 --> 17:33.200]  It's great.
[17:33.200 --> 17:35.760]  For an extra two bucks a month,
[17:35.760 --> 17:37.280]  this is one of the add-ons they have,
[17:37.280 --> 17:42.240]  you can have retention for an entire year.
[17:42.240 --> 17:45.840]  So if you delete a file and keep going on,
[17:45.840 --> 17:48.360]  Backblaze runs, backs up your Mac,
[17:48.360 --> 17:49.400]  a couple months later,
[17:49.400 --> 17:51.240]  you realize some file that you deleted,
[17:51.240 --> 17:54.280]  your backups now are in the current state of your drive,
[17:54.280 --> 17:57.300]  you can go back months later and get that file you deleted.
[17:57.300 --> 18:00.500]  If with a $2, that's it, just two bucks a month extra.
[18:00.500 --> 18:03.840]  Anyway, you start with a 15-day free trial,
[18:03.840 --> 18:07.260]  backblaze.com slash the talk show.
[18:07.260 --> 18:09.200]  Get a 15-day free trial with that link,
[18:09.200 --> 18:12.560]  backblaze.com slash the talk show.
[18:12.560 --> 18:13.400]  I recommend it.
[18:13.400 --> 18:15.200]  I've been using Backblaze personally
[18:15.200 --> 18:17.400]  for more years than I can count,
[18:17.400 --> 18:19.880]  and it just runs and runs and runs and never gets in the way.
[18:19.880 --> 18:20.780]  My thanks to them.
[18:21.800 --> 18:22.640]  I'm with you.
[18:22.640 --> 18:26.400]  I think that the case situation is so different
[18:26.400 --> 18:28.320]  between phones and watches
[18:28.320 --> 18:31.400]  where almost everybody puts their phones in a case
[18:31.400 --> 18:34.480]  and almost nobody puts an Apple Watch in a case
[18:34.480 --> 18:37.840]  or like a protective wraparound strap.
[18:37.840 --> 18:39.200]  I'm not even sure why you would.
[18:39.200 --> 18:43.880]  I mean, I guess there's this sort of G-Shock mentality
[18:43.880 --> 18:44.720]  and there's rumors,
[18:44.720 --> 18:47.480]  German has rumored that Apple's even considering a watch
[18:47.480 --> 18:49.100]  that's in that space.
[18:49.100 --> 18:50.960]  But when I see people with the thing,
[18:50.960 --> 18:53.560]  it doesn't look like they're using it to go rock climbing.
[18:53.560 --> 18:56.760]  There just seem like people who are afraid of
[18:56.760 --> 18:58.000]  scratching their watch,
[18:58.000 --> 19:01.200]  but it's very rare that I see somebody like that.
[19:01.200 --> 19:02.720]  There's a specific kind of personality
[19:02.720 --> 19:04.360]  that puts everything in a case.
[19:04.360 --> 19:05.200]  Right.
[19:05.200 --> 19:06.360]  And like, I want to,
[19:06.360 --> 19:08.080]  maybe we should just like find like four of those people
[19:08.080 --> 19:10.640]  on profile and be like, why is your first instinct
[19:10.640 --> 19:11.800]  to wrap everything in a case?
[19:11.800 --> 19:12.800]  Like, I get it with a phone.
[19:12.800 --> 19:14.720]  I drop my phone a lot.
[19:14.720 --> 19:16.520]  Your watch, like, if you're dropping your watch,
[19:16.520 --> 19:19.120]  you're kind of necessarily dropping yourself, right?
[19:21.120 --> 19:22.680]  You're kind of doing it wrong, right?
[19:22.680 --> 19:25.040]  It's like, and I know, you know,
[19:25.040 --> 19:28.240]  I've worn a watch my whole, ever since I was a teenager.
[19:28.240 --> 19:29.360]  And it's like, every once in a while,
[19:29.360 --> 19:33.080]  you like bang it against a doorway or something, you know,
[19:33.080 --> 19:34.080]  and you take a look.
[19:34.080 --> 19:35.880]  And, you know, usually my watches over the years,
[19:35.880 --> 19:38.040]  I've never, you know, every once in a while,
[19:38.040 --> 19:40.080]  I'd get like a scratch or something here or there,
[19:40.080 --> 19:41.320]  but for the most part, they don't,
[19:41.320 --> 19:44.280]  they don't really seem like they need a case.
[19:44.280 --> 19:48.280]  But this lack of a neutral color option
[19:48.280 --> 19:50.480]  that there's starlight instead of silver
[19:50.480 --> 19:51.920]  at the aluminum level.
[19:51.920 --> 19:52.760]  Yeah.
[19:52.760 --> 19:54.240]  And midnight, which is blue.
[19:54.240 --> 19:57.480]  The other thing that that, my personal tastes,
[19:57.480 --> 20:02.240]  shocking, shockingly, lean towards neutral colors.
[20:02.240 --> 20:04.920]  But the other thing about neutral colors
[20:04.920 --> 20:09.680]  is they then go with any straps or bands you want to use.
[20:09.680 --> 20:14.040]  And that's sort of a big, or not even sort of,
[20:14.040 --> 20:18.960]  it's a big part of the Apple Watch ecosystem
[20:18.960 --> 20:21.520]  is that a lot of people, for everybody out there,
[20:21.520 --> 20:24.520]  I'm sure most people pick a strap, never change it,
[20:24.520 --> 20:26.560]  you know, don't even know how to change the straps.
[20:26.560 --> 20:29.680]  But there are a lot of people who love the easy,
[20:29.680 --> 20:31.680]  I can change these straps, you know,
[20:31.680 --> 20:34.560]  with just push a button, slide it out, put another one in.
[20:34.560 --> 20:38.040]  The compatibility, the fact that every Apple Watch strap
[20:38.040 --> 20:41.200]  made since 2015 is still compatible, you know,
[20:41.200 --> 20:44.000]  either at the smaller or the large size,
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.880]  means that people who are on like their second or third,
[20:46.880 --> 20:48.680]  or if you're like an enthusiast,
[20:48.680 --> 20:50.400]  like your fourth Apple Watch,
[20:50.400 --> 20:53.080]  the straps you've already bought are compatible.
[20:54.640 --> 20:55.960]  But, you know, it's like, I don't know,
[20:55.960 --> 20:59.560]  if you have like champagne as your watch color,
[20:59.560 --> 21:01.840]  to me that rules out certain colors to go with it.
[21:01.840 --> 21:06.600]  And the same thing with like a blue hinted midnight,
[21:06.600 --> 21:08.480]  maybe it doesn't go with certain straps
[21:08.480 --> 21:11.400]  that plain space gray would.
[21:11.400 --> 21:13.800]  Yeah, I mean, maybe the data is saying
[21:13.800 --> 21:16.640]  that people aren't doing that as much as we think.
[21:16.640 --> 21:18.640]  I do think that's a fun part
[21:18.640 --> 21:20.480]  of the Apple Watch experience,
[21:20.480 --> 21:21.880]  that you can change these as much as you want.
[21:21.880 --> 21:25.640]  And there's like, there's a thriving aftermarket
[21:25.640 --> 21:27.880]  for straps and Apple seems to love that too,
[21:27.880 --> 21:30.720]  which is sort of, here's a question for you.
[21:30.720 --> 21:32.280]  Is there more pressure on Apple
[21:32.280 --> 21:36.880]  to retain the Apple Watch connector, the strap connector,
[21:36.880 --> 21:38.640]  than there is to retain lightning?
[21:39.680 --> 21:42.400]  That thing is, it defines the shape of the watch
[21:42.400 --> 21:43.760]  at this point.
[21:43.760 --> 21:48.120]  Yeah, I think it's different, a different sort of pressure.
[21:48.120 --> 21:52.920]  Would people be angry if they changed the strap connector?
[21:52.920 --> 21:55.480]  Probably, yeah, people get angry at everything.
[21:55.480 --> 21:57.000]  And there is, you know,
[21:57.000 --> 21:59.560]  and of course you're always gonna run into the people
[21:59.560 --> 22:03.840]  who say, well, I just bought three straps last month.
[22:03.840 --> 22:05.360]  Yeah, right?
[22:05.360 --> 22:07.280]  And it's like, and now they're introducing
[22:07.280 --> 22:10.400]  a different strap size or different connector.
[22:10.400 --> 22:14.560]  I don't know, I do wonder whether they feel hamstrung.
[22:14.560 --> 22:16.880]  Is it a bit of an albatross around their neck
[22:16.880 --> 22:19.120]  as they designed the Series 7?
[22:19.120 --> 22:21.760]  And they're like, let's go a little bigger
[22:21.760 --> 22:24.680]  because we're gonna put this bigger edge,
[22:24.680 --> 22:26.960]  closer to true edge-to-edge display
[22:26.960 --> 22:29.760]  and we're gonna increase the size of the case
[22:29.760 --> 22:30.640]  by a millimeter.
[22:30.640 --> 22:35.640]  But is that strap compatibility like,
[22:35.680 --> 22:38.720]  if only we could just tweak the strap connector
[22:38.720 --> 22:42.680]  a little bit, whoa, this would be a little bit blank.
[22:42.680 --> 22:45.080]  I don't know if it'd be narrower or something.
[22:45.080 --> 22:47.400]  I don't know, probably, it's probably,
[22:47.400 --> 22:50.080]  at least to some degree, a constraint
[22:50.080 --> 22:52.200]  they wish they didn't have to deal with, but.
[22:52.200 --> 22:53.680]  Well, I mean, they made that decision,
[22:53.680 --> 22:54.960]  well, you know, they made the decision
[22:54.960 --> 22:57.680]  before they announced it, they announced the thing in 2015.
[22:57.680 --> 23:00.480]  So they made this decision about the strap connector
[23:00.480 --> 23:02.760]  in what, 2013, 2014?
[23:02.760 --> 23:05.040]  They couldn't have known where the watch was going.
[23:05.040 --> 23:06.640]  Right.
[23:06.640 --> 23:09.600]  And most of those, you know, Cheyenne's gone.
[23:09.600 --> 23:13.360]  So like, it's another person's ultimate decision.
[23:13.360 --> 23:14.200]  I've always thought about it.
[23:14.200 --> 23:16.440]  Like, we spend so much time thinking about it,
[23:16.440 --> 23:20.160]  Lightning versus USB-C versus Apple's proprietary
[23:20.160 --> 23:22.280]  Bluetooth extension, and it's like,
[23:22.280 --> 23:24.780]  oh, they've got this, like, other hardware connector
[23:24.780 --> 23:27.720]  that has a, probably its most thriving ecosystem
[23:28.880 --> 23:32.200]  of straps, but it defines the shape of the product
[23:32.200 --> 23:34.120]  in a way that Lightning does not, right?
[23:34.120 --> 23:35.460]  Yeah.
[23:35.460 --> 23:37.400]  And I've always wanted to, do they,
[23:37.400 --> 23:38.800]  is there's gotta be some designer at Apple
[23:38.800 --> 23:40.500]  that's just like, man, let me make it different.
[23:40.500 --> 23:42.280]  Like, the whole watch would look different.
[23:42.280 --> 23:43.220]  It would be so much cooler,
[23:43.220 --> 23:46.020]  but they're bought into it now after all this time.
[23:46.020 --> 23:48.320]  Well, that's why I'm so intrigued by Germin's rumor
[23:48.320 --> 23:52.240]  about a G-Shock style sport watch,
[23:52.240 --> 23:54.900]  like a rugged watch, for lack of a better term,
[23:56.560 --> 24:00.680]  because, well, it could still fit the same straps.
[24:00.680 --> 24:04.880]  I mean, just put that slot on the top and bottom.
[24:04.880 --> 24:06.880]  But that would, to me, would be an opportunity
[24:06.880 --> 24:10.560]  where they might introduce a different slot,
[24:10.560 --> 24:12.880]  a different watch connector.
[24:12.880 --> 24:14.640]  I don't know, you know,
[24:14.640 --> 24:16.680]  because presumably that watch would look,
[24:16.680 --> 24:19.020]  that would be the first Apple watch that they make
[24:19.020 --> 24:22.560]  that is instantly recognizable as a different watch.
[24:22.560 --> 24:24.720]  I mean, that was a big part of my review this week
[24:24.720 --> 24:25.680]  for the Series 7.
[24:25.680 --> 24:28.380]  They don't see this as a product that needs to be,
[24:28.380 --> 24:30.880]  like, reimagined in the way that, like,
[24:30.880 --> 24:33.780]  the iPhone 4 was like, whoa, whoa,
[24:33.780 --> 24:37.460]  this looks nothing like the previous iPhones.
[24:37.460 --> 24:42.460]  The way that iPads have had a couple of moments like that,
[24:43.420 --> 24:46.080]  even though the tablet shape is sort of,
[24:46.080 --> 24:47.780]  look, it's just a tablet, you know,
[24:47.780 --> 24:49.980]  there's not that much you can do with it.
[24:49.980 --> 24:53.820]  Apple Watch, you know, it really does seem like they,
[24:53.820 --> 24:56.560]  they're not just content with it,
[24:56.560 --> 24:58.620]  but that they really feel like they nailed it
[24:58.620 --> 25:00.900]  from the first go, so I don't know.
[25:00.900 --> 25:02.700]  I feel like Lightning is more of a,
[25:03.620 --> 25:07.360]  probably more politically sticky.
[25:07.360 --> 25:08.540]  Yeah, I mean, there's a million reasons.
[25:08.540 --> 25:10.500]  That's why it's just a, like, a thought experiment.
[25:10.500 --> 25:11.340]  Like, it is.
[25:11.340 --> 25:13.560]  Which do they feel more constrained by?
[25:13.560 --> 25:14.700]  It's not Lightning, right?
[25:14.700 --> 25:16.700]  They're just, like, happy to keep putting
[25:16.700 --> 25:18.340]  that connector on there until we all assume
[25:18.340 --> 25:20.140]  one day they're gonna take it away,
[25:20.140 --> 25:21.860]  and while you're used to it, whereas this one,
[25:21.860 --> 25:25.640]  it's like, it literally defines the shape of the product.
[25:26.860 --> 25:28.260]  You know, the iPad's, like, an interesting one,
[25:28.260 --> 25:30.320]  that, you know, that low-end iPad,
[25:30.320 --> 25:34.260]  the roots of that go straight to the iPad 2.
[25:34.260 --> 25:35.220]  Yeah.
[25:35.220 --> 25:37.180]  Right, and that, they've been very comfortable with that,
[25:37.180 --> 25:40.980]  and the other ones have had to make look different
[25:40.980 --> 25:44.500]  to differentiate them from, you know,
[25:44.500 --> 25:45.840]  the base model, so they're pro,
[25:45.840 --> 25:48.140]  and Apple making things look different
[25:48.140 --> 25:50.240]  and not look different to drive sales,
[25:50.240 --> 25:53.140]  to drive market differentiation is, like,
[25:53.140 --> 25:57.040]  one of the most interesting dynamics of this company.
[25:57.040 --> 25:59.240]  Other companies make things look different all the time.
[25:59.240 --> 26:00.900]  It's the easiest way to get attention.
[26:00.900 --> 26:02.020]  It looks different.
[26:02.020 --> 26:04.260]  Apple is, like, very deliberate about it,
[26:04.260 --> 26:06.380]  and I think with the watch,
[26:06.380 --> 26:08.860]  once they wanna drive that bigger upgrade cycle,
[26:08.860 --> 26:11.280]  and they're kinda at the far limit of,
[26:11.280 --> 26:13.900]  we made the screen bigger, right,
[26:13.900 --> 26:15.500]  because bigger screens are the most,
[26:15.500 --> 26:17.400]  like, that was why I upgraded the last time.
[26:17.400 --> 26:19.340]  I was like, oh, the 4 has a bigger screen.
[26:19.340 --> 26:20.460]  I want that right away.
[26:21.300 --> 26:23.380]  It's why I'm like, even though I don't need this watch,
[26:23.380 --> 26:24.780]  I'm not leaving my house alone.
[26:24.780 --> 26:26.840]  I don't really need this thing.
[26:26.840 --> 26:28.740]  I'm like, oh, it has a bigger screen, I want it,
[26:28.740 --> 26:31.740]  whereas the next, they're kinda out of that move,
[26:31.740 --> 26:32.580]  so the next time they do this,
[26:32.580 --> 26:33.980]  it might have to change the way it looks.
[26:33.980 --> 26:34.820]  Yeah.
[26:34.820 --> 26:38.820]  The 5, the big one for me was the always-on display,
[26:38.820 --> 26:42.000]  so I skipped the Apple Watch Series 4,
[26:42.000 --> 26:42.840]  even though it did,
[26:42.840 --> 26:44.800]  it was the first one that introduced the bigger screen,
[26:44.800 --> 26:46.680]  and even though it intrigued me,
[26:46.680 --> 26:48.940]  because I'd just bought a Series 3 the year before,
[26:48.940 --> 26:50.560]  and I was like, well, I can live with it,
[26:50.560 --> 26:52.040]  and then when the Series 5 came out
[26:52.040 --> 26:53.540]  with the always-on display,
[26:53.540 --> 26:55.460]  I was like, I have to have that immediately,
[26:55.460 --> 26:57.060]  because it was my single biggest complaint
[26:57.060 --> 27:01.620]  with Apple Watch original, then 2, 3, 4,
[27:01.620 --> 27:03.580]  was the lack of an always-on display,
[27:03.580 --> 27:06.340]  and I kind of realized that it's one of those,
[27:07.380 --> 27:10.660]  I perseverate on that point more than a lot of people.
[27:10.660 --> 27:13.920]  Like, all of my reviews before the Series 5,
[27:13.920 --> 27:14.760]  people would be like, wow,
[27:14.760 --> 27:15.900]  you really spent a lot of words
[27:15.900 --> 27:19.300]  talking about the fact that the time isn't always on,
[27:19.300 --> 27:23.020]  and it's, I think I'm self-aware that I,
[27:23.020 --> 27:26.220]  it's partly because I'm used to mechanical watches
[27:26.220 --> 27:28.660]  where you never have to worry, you know,
[27:28.660 --> 27:30.500]  you can always, as long as there's enough light
[27:30.500 --> 27:33.900]  to see the dial, you can read the time,
[27:33.900 --> 27:36.240]  but it's also like a sort of,
[27:39.260 --> 27:41.060]  I've always been a little self-conscious
[27:41.060 --> 27:43.400]  about looking like I'm checking the time,
[27:43.400 --> 27:45.460]  you know, that it's like a signal that you're bored,
[27:45.460 --> 27:48.580]  and I know, I realize that like probably 98% of people
[27:48.580 --> 27:51.200]  don't even notice, they never think twice about it,
[27:51.200 --> 27:54.060]  but for some reason, like in 19,
[27:54.060 --> 27:56.540]  I think it was 1988 when George Bush was running
[27:56.540 --> 27:58.100]  against Michael Dukakis, there was,
[27:58.100 --> 28:01.100]  they had a debate, and George Bush,
[28:01.100 --> 28:04.140]  the old George Bush was seen checking his watch
[28:04.140 --> 28:06.080]  like halfway through the debate,
[28:06.080 --> 28:08.860]  which to me is a reasonable thing for somebody
[28:08.860 --> 28:11.340]  who knows they're in a 90-minute debate.
[28:11.340 --> 28:14.520]  Like, whenever I'm on stage in front of people,
[28:15.580 --> 28:18.460]  and I think even if you're like running for president
[28:18.460 --> 28:20.220]  and you're used to it, it's high pressure,
[28:20.220 --> 28:22.540]  and you know that the debate is particularly high pressure,
[28:22.540 --> 28:25.540]  and time flows in a funny way, right?
[28:25.540 --> 28:29.620]  Like, where you feel, like when I'm interviewing people
[28:29.620 --> 28:32.460]  doing my WWDC show, and you know,
[28:32.460 --> 28:34.420]  a thousand people in the audience,
[28:34.420 --> 28:39.100]  and one shot to take this video that's gonna be seen
[28:39.100 --> 28:40.940]  by, you know, a hundred thousand people
[28:40.940 --> 28:42.900]  after I publish it to Daring Fireball,
[28:42.900 --> 28:44.980]  and I'll glance at my watch,
[28:44.980 --> 28:46.700]  because I think, oh my God,
[28:46.700 --> 28:47.980]  we must be halfway through, right?
[28:47.980 --> 28:50.140]  And I look, and it's like, we're five minutes in,
[28:50.140 --> 28:50.980]  and I'm like, oh my God.
[28:50.980 --> 28:52.580]  Do you find that that first 10 minutes takes forever?
[28:52.580 --> 28:53.980]  Yes, I do, every time.
[28:53.980 --> 28:55.780]  And after that, the rest flies by.
[28:55.780 --> 28:58.580]  Exactly, that's every single time.
[28:58.580 --> 29:00.740]  This is me on Decoder every week.
[29:00.740 --> 29:01.580]  Every time.
[29:01.580 --> 29:03.360]  I'm like, oh man, I gotta make this interesting for an hour,
[29:03.360 --> 29:05.220]  and that first 10 minutes are kinda cold, right?
[29:05.220 --> 29:06.060]  Right.
[29:06.060 --> 29:06.880]  The guest is kinda cold,
[29:06.880 --> 29:09.980]  and you're both hoping, whatever, like, things work,
[29:09.980 --> 29:13.660]  and you're like, oh, if I just make it through this first 10.
[29:13.660 --> 29:16.300]  It takes forever, and I realize
[29:16.300 --> 29:20.120]  that I'm only on, like, my first index card,
[29:20.120 --> 29:21.620]  and I'm like, I've blown this.
[29:21.620 --> 29:22.860]  We're halfway through.
[29:22.860 --> 29:24.700]  I'm only on the first index card.
[29:26.100 --> 29:28.220]  And then I think, like, don't start sweating.
[29:28.220 --> 29:31.500]  Don't start sweating, even though you've clearly blown it.
[29:31.500 --> 29:33.300]  But then I sneak a look at my watch,
[29:33.300 --> 29:35.900]  and I'm like, oh, we're only five minutes in, what?
[29:35.900 --> 29:37.580]  And then next time I check my watch, it's like,
[29:37.580 --> 29:41.340]  oh, I've gone over the time I promised them we'd be done.
[29:41.340 --> 29:42.580]  What happened?
[29:42.580 --> 29:44.060]  Yeah, oh, literally,
[29:44.060 --> 29:47.220]  I have this experience every week on Decoder.
[29:47.220 --> 29:49.520]  I like to glance at my watch in a way
[29:49.520 --> 29:53.460]  that is without, like, the big wrist raise.
[29:53.460 --> 29:55.660]  And with the Apple Watch before the Always On,
[29:55.660 --> 29:58.780]  the wrist raise was sort of an ostentatious movement,
[29:58.780 --> 30:01.340]  because you wanna make sure your watch triggers it.
[30:02.500 --> 30:03.340]  So that was a good one.
[30:03.340 --> 30:04.840]  I got really good at a subtle tap.
[30:05.700 --> 30:08.580]  Like, I would just sort of put my hand over there
[30:08.580 --> 30:10.580]  and just, like, give it a little tap.
[30:10.580 --> 30:13.460]  I mean, what's funny to me about this
[30:13.460 --> 30:15.000]  is none of this matters to me,
[30:15.000 --> 30:17.140]  because I don't leave my house anymore.
[30:17.140 --> 30:18.940]  Like, all of this was really important
[30:18.940 --> 30:20.780]  when I was in meetings, I was going places,
[30:20.780 --> 30:24.460]  I was talking to people, I was waiting for trains, whatever.
[30:24.460 --> 30:27.460]  The Always On display, like, its value has plummeted
[30:27.460 --> 30:30.940]  inside of my home, which is interesting.
[30:30.940 --> 30:32.320]  Like, you know, we're gonna go back out
[30:32.320 --> 30:36.620]  in the world eventually, but to me that, right,
[30:36.620 --> 30:37.580]  you make the screen bigger,
[30:37.580 --> 30:40.980]  Always On is another screen upgrade, right?
[30:40.980 --> 30:43.360]  The thing that has driven the cycle for the Apple Watch
[30:43.360 --> 30:47.620]  for me and for you in a different way is screen upgrades.
[30:47.620 --> 30:49.060]  Yep, right?
[30:49.060 --> 30:50.740]  Battery life upgrades to some extent,
[30:50.740 --> 30:52.180]  but mostly screen upgrades.
[30:52.180 --> 30:53.640]  They've added all the sensors, those are cool,
[30:53.640 --> 30:55.980]  but they come from the ride with the screen for me.
[30:55.980 --> 30:56.820]  Yeah.
[30:56.820 --> 30:59.380]  They're just, they're kinda, with this one,
[30:59.380 --> 31:02.260]  it's hard to see the next move they can make
[31:02.260 --> 31:04.980]  unless they make it yet bigger, which would be interesting,
[31:04.980 --> 31:06.420]  or they do something else.
[31:06.420 --> 31:11.420]  It's, you know, and, like, the two newest sensors
[31:11.740 --> 31:15.560]  are the blood oxygen and the ECG,
[31:15.560 --> 31:19.940]  and, you know, I'm glad I have an ECG sensor,
[31:19.940 --> 31:22.100]  and so far, knock on wood,
[31:22.100 --> 31:25.460]  it has never once alerted me to anything,
[31:25.460 --> 31:28.620]  but I enjoy every time somebody sends me a, you know,
[31:28.620 --> 31:31.620]  random story from somewhere where somebody,
[31:31.620 --> 31:35.100]  some regular Apple Watch user who had no idea
[31:35.100 --> 31:36.260]  that they might have a heart problem,
[31:36.260 --> 31:37.880]  their watch said, hey, you know,
[31:37.880 --> 31:39.520]  maybe you should call your doctor, you know,
[31:39.520 --> 31:41.900]  there's an irregularity, and they go to their doctor,
[31:41.900 --> 31:44.140]  and their doctor is like, yeah, you've got a problem,
[31:44.140 --> 31:45.960]  but we can, you know, it's a good thing you came in,
[31:45.960 --> 31:48.660]  but we can fix this right up, and you'll be fine.
[31:48.660 --> 31:51.580]  So I'm glad it's there, but it's never once gone off for me.
[31:51.580 --> 31:54.760]  I don't, I've never once checked my blood oxygen level,
[31:54.760 --> 31:59.220]  so, like, if I found out that my Series 7 review unit
[31:59.220 --> 32:03.220]  actually didn't have either of those, I wouldn't know.
[32:03.220 --> 32:05.460]  Well, it's hard to demonstrate the value of a thing
[32:05.460 --> 32:08.540]  that is only valuable when something is wrong, you know?
[32:08.540 --> 32:09.380]  Right.
[32:09.380 --> 32:11.980]  Well, and this is like the smoke detector problem.
[32:11.980 --> 32:14.820]  Yeah, you can buy more expensive smoke detectors,
[32:14.820 --> 32:17.260]  but it's like, it doesn't really matter.
[32:17.260 --> 32:18.940]  For the most part, our smoke detectors
[32:18.940 --> 32:20.780]  have only ever gone off when there's been,
[32:20.780 --> 32:24.900]  like, a smokey kitchen, and it's an annoyance,
[32:24.900 --> 32:27.120]  but it always reassures me, it's like, hey,
[32:27.120 --> 32:29.940]  this actually isn't that smokey, so I'm glad, you know,
[32:29.940 --> 32:33.020]  that's what I always tell myself as I climb up a step stool
[32:33.020 --> 32:34.940]  because our ceilings are just tall enough
[32:34.940 --> 32:37.580]  that I can't quite reach it without using a step stool,
[32:37.580 --> 32:40.260]  and I think to myself every time, well, it's actually,
[32:40.260 --> 32:42.620]  you know, I'm actually glad that this went off, anyway.
[32:42.620 --> 32:45.420]  I'm glad that my You're Searing a Steak detector
[32:45.420 --> 32:48.660]  went off, too, so that's what happens for me every time.
[32:48.660 --> 32:50.260]  But do you read that Business Insider story
[32:50.260 --> 32:54.540]  about Apple's health division and kind of lack of focus?
[32:54.540 --> 32:56.940]  This to me is like the, right, they're really promoting,
[32:56.940 --> 33:00.420]  the ads for the Series 7 are all about health,
[33:00.420 --> 33:02.460]  they're all about, you know, these features,
[33:02.460 --> 33:04.960]  checking your blood oxygen on the side of a mountain,
[33:04.960 --> 33:07.140]  and it, you know, there's this Business Insider story
[33:07.140 --> 33:09.960]  that's like, this division has suffered
[33:09.960 --> 33:13.060]  and lack of focus, it's had a lot of executive turnover,
[33:13.060 --> 33:15.380]  that there is a piece of this puzzle
[33:15.380 --> 33:17.660]  where they're adding the capabilities
[33:17.660 --> 33:20.840]  and they haven't really articulated why.
[33:20.840 --> 33:23.080]  And I, you know, I read that piece,
[33:23.080 --> 33:24.460]  and I was like, oh, this kind of makes sense,
[33:24.460 --> 33:26.620]  like, they are still figuring it out.
[33:27.900 --> 33:31.980]  Yeah, and it does seem like, I have not seen the story,
[33:31.980 --> 33:36.060]  but it kind of rings true to me where,
[33:36.060 --> 33:40.260]  in a very, unlike most things at Apple,
[33:40.260 --> 33:43.660]  a sort of spaghetti against the wall approach
[33:43.660 --> 33:45.340]  kind of works, right?
[33:45.340 --> 33:48.680]  Like if, you know, there's been a team,
[33:48.680 --> 33:51.300]  presumably there was a team dedicated
[33:51.300 --> 33:56.300]  to getting blood oxygen sensing to fit in the watch
[33:56.460 --> 34:00.260]  in a way that would, you know, not make the watch enormous
[34:00.260 --> 34:02.900]  or make it more expensive, you know,
[34:02.900 --> 34:06.200]  a cost-effective way to add that sensor,
[34:06.200 --> 34:07.900]  and at one point they were like,
[34:07.900 --> 34:10.420]  we think we can do this this year, you know,
[34:10.420 --> 34:12.220]  get together with the rest of the hardware team,
[34:12.220 --> 34:14.560]  integrate it, but, you know, before that,
[34:14.560 --> 34:17.980]  they were just working on this one thing,
[34:17.980 --> 34:20.040]  blood oxygen sensing.
[34:20.040 --> 34:22.860]  Yeah, I mean, they have to build the sensors, but.
[34:22.860 --> 34:23.700]  Right.
[34:23.700 --> 34:25.260]  And that seems very difficult,
[34:25.260 --> 34:26.420]  and the sensors are doing well, you know,
[34:26.420 --> 34:28.260]  there's a handful of now peer-reviewed studies
[34:28.260 --> 34:32.180]  saying they are as accurate as some of the medical devices,
[34:32.180 --> 34:33.660]  but they're still not medical devices, right?
[34:33.660 --> 34:35.540]  They're not FDA approved for this use,
[34:35.540 --> 34:39.100]  like there's a long way to go with just
[34:39.100 --> 34:41.740]  is the sensor a medical device?
[34:41.740 --> 34:43.620]  Okay, that's a challenging problem,
[34:43.620 --> 34:46.100]  but, you know, Apple had these grand plans,
[34:46.100 --> 34:47.240]  you know, they bought a healthcare company,
[34:47.240 --> 34:48.680]  they're gonna run clinics for their own employees,
[34:48.680 --> 34:49.520]  they're gonna do all this stuff,
[34:49.520 --> 34:52.180]  and that stuff turns out to be very complicated.
[34:52.180 --> 34:54.080]  It's a different kind of problem
[34:54.080 --> 34:57.480]  than just building the hardware and software capability,
[34:57.480 --> 35:00.020]  and that to me is where, you know,
[35:00.020 --> 35:01.360]  Tim Cook has said for years,
[35:01.360 --> 35:03.620]  Apple's greatest contribution will be in health,
[35:03.620 --> 35:04.780]  they're advertising the watch
[35:04.780 --> 35:06.940]  as a health device more and more,
[35:06.940 --> 35:09.900]  and underneath it, I mean, I haven't sent,
[35:09.900 --> 35:11.700]  other than, you know, Apple Fitness
[35:11.700 --> 35:14.520]  and track your heart rate, close your rings,
[35:14.520 --> 35:16.220]  which appears to be fairly focused
[35:16.220 --> 35:18.860]  because it's a simpler kind of thing.
[35:18.860 --> 35:21.620]  The actual, we're gonna integrate the watch
[35:21.620 --> 35:26.100]  with your healthcare, like your proper full-on healthcare
[35:26.100 --> 35:28.180]  has never been fully connected,
[35:28.180 --> 35:29.660]  and I was wondering if you had any insight,
[35:29.660 --> 35:30.780]  because I read that story and I was like,
[35:30.780 --> 35:32.820]  man, this sounds like, you know,
[35:32.820 --> 35:34.980]  I would draw the parallel to like the car,
[35:34.980 --> 35:37.660]  where like they've taken 50 shots at the car
[35:37.660 --> 35:40.460]  and they haven't figured out how they wanna do it,
[35:40.460 --> 35:42.120]  but at least the car's secret.
[35:42.120 --> 35:43.660]  The watch is like, I'm still buying them,
[35:43.660 --> 35:46.000]  people are buying them, they're super popular.
[35:46.000 --> 35:47.420]  They have the scale to accomplish
[35:47.420 --> 35:49.580]  some of the things they wanna accomplish.
[35:49.580 --> 35:51.480]  I think it's an interesting domain
[35:51.480 --> 35:54.140]  because I kind of feel that the unfocused,
[35:54.140 --> 35:58.220]  look, we can just keep adding sensors as we can,
[35:58.220 --> 36:01.100]  and some will be more important than others,
[36:01.100 --> 36:03.860]  or like the ECG thing is very important,
[36:03.860 --> 36:05.140]  because if it actually,
[36:05.140 --> 36:07.780]  if you do have that sort of irregularity,
[36:07.780 --> 36:10.220]  it's genuinely life-threatening,
[36:10.220 --> 36:12.560]  but it's also very rare, right?
[36:12.560 --> 36:15.780]  So most people, it's never going to be an issue.
[36:17.540 --> 36:22.540]  You can kind of add them piecemeal over the years
[36:22.540 --> 36:25.100]  as they're ready, and it doesn't matter
[36:25.100 --> 36:28.220]  because that's not the prime reason people are buying
[36:28.220 --> 36:29.140]  the watch, right?
[36:29.140 --> 36:33.060]  They're buying the watch because it's just a general,
[36:33.060 --> 36:36.060]  it, A, it's a watch, it tells you what time it is,
[36:36.060 --> 36:37.760]  it tells you your notifications,
[36:37.760 --> 36:42.760]  which is the big non-health-related breakthrough, right?
[36:43.140 --> 36:45.940]  All the other stuff, nonsense in hindsight,
[36:45.940 --> 36:48.100]  that they talked about in the original Apple Watch,
[36:48.100 --> 36:50.460]  notifications, that you can get your notifications
[36:50.460 --> 36:52.460]  right there on your wrist,
[36:52.460 --> 36:55.200]  is the big non-health-related,
[36:55.200 --> 36:56.800]  this is why you want an Apple Watch
[36:56.800 --> 36:59.140]  or any other smartwatch, like for Android,
[36:59.140 --> 37:01.460]  instead of a dumb watch,
[37:01.460 --> 37:03.900]  and then there's the general health and fitness,
[37:03.900 --> 37:06.400]  where you count your steps and your stands
[37:06.400 --> 37:09.980]  and your exercise hours.
[37:09.980 --> 37:12.420]  You know how to add to that that is super useful,
[37:12.420 --> 37:14.020]  and I recommend this to everyone?
[37:14.020 --> 37:15.940]  Put your two-factor app on your watch
[37:15.940 --> 37:17.460]  so you can get your codes right away.
[37:17.460 --> 37:19.700]  It is, I don't know why Apple should just like
[37:19.700 --> 37:23.320]  build a two-factor system and advertise it heavily,
[37:23.320 --> 37:25.840]  because it has a capability of the watch,
[37:25.840 --> 37:29.120]  remarkably convenient in our current climate.
[37:29.120 --> 37:31.840]  I have, I use OTHI for my two-factor,
[37:31.840 --> 37:33.700]  which I really like a lot.
[37:34.860 --> 37:37.400]  I moved away from Google Authenticator years ago
[37:37.400 --> 37:38.700]  because Google Authenticator,
[37:38.700 --> 37:40.660]  and apparently this is better now, I wrote about this,
[37:40.660 --> 37:42.500]  but with Google Authenticator,
[37:42.500 --> 37:44.820]  it was always a huge pain in the ass
[37:44.820 --> 37:46.300]  when you upgraded your phone,
[37:46.300 --> 37:48.820]  because it was like a one-phone-at-a-time thing,
[37:48.820 --> 37:51.340]  and I had like a, I think I mentioned this on my show
[37:51.340 --> 37:53.940]  a couple weeks ago, like a real panic attack moment,
[37:54.980 --> 37:57.220]  like a couple of years back
[37:57.220 --> 38:00.660]  when I got a review unit phone, I'd set it up,
[38:00.660 --> 38:03.700]  I think I started setting it up in Pansarino's car,
[38:03.700 --> 38:06.260]  driving from Cupertino back to San Francisco,
[38:07.400 --> 38:10.500]  and it was out and needed a two-factor code,
[38:10.500 --> 38:12.580]  and I was on this new phone
[38:12.580 --> 38:14.220]  and went to Google Authenticator,
[38:14.220 --> 38:16.780]  and they're like, new number, who dat?
[38:16.780 --> 38:18.980]  And it's like, oh my God, I don't have any of my
[38:18.980 --> 38:22.460]  two-factor codes, and you know,
[38:22.460 --> 38:24.780]  oh, I could just go back to my hotel room
[38:24.780 --> 38:26.680]  and get my old phone, which was still there
[38:26.680 --> 38:28.200]  and still had the codes, but you know,
[38:28.200 --> 38:30.540]  but it's a moment you don't want, right?
[38:30.540 --> 38:33.000]  Like when you go to get your two-factor codes
[38:33.000 --> 38:34.380]  and none of them are there,
[38:34.380 --> 38:35.960]  and it's like, we don't know who you are,
[38:35.960 --> 38:39.360]  it breaks you out in a cold sweat, you know?
[38:39.360 --> 38:40.860]  So I switched to Authy years ago.
[38:40.860 --> 38:43.680]  Authy has been great, but having it on my phone is awesome,
[38:43.680 --> 38:46.940]  because if you're in some random place,
[38:46.940 --> 38:48.980]  logging into a website or something like that,
[38:48.980 --> 38:51.220]  just having it on your wrist is awesome.
[38:51.220 --> 38:53.920]  Yeah, and it's just funny to me that I'm assuming
[38:53.920 --> 38:56.680]  a lot of Apple employees have two-factor issues
[38:56.680 --> 39:00.140]  all the time, and here's this one function of watch
[39:00.140 --> 39:03.980]  that is just completely underappreciated that I love,
[39:03.980 --> 39:06.140]  and it's like, oh man, this is,
[39:06.140 --> 39:07.700]  if you try to get me to switch smartwatches,
[39:07.700 --> 39:10.860]  I would ask, do you have a two-factor app
[39:10.860 --> 39:12.780]  that I can use that works as well as this one,
[39:12.780 --> 39:14.740]  and if you don't, I wouldn't switch.
[39:15.740 --> 39:17.720]  I use it all day, every day.
[39:17.720 --> 39:19.280]  To me, that's been,
[39:21.780 --> 39:24.660]  the watch itself as the second factor
[39:24.660 --> 39:29.340]  has been a huge motivation for me to wear my Apple Watch
[39:29.340 --> 39:32.820]  way more than I had been before the pandemic.
[39:32.820 --> 39:35.820]  The thing with the masks has been game-changing for me.
[39:35.820 --> 39:37.340]  Yeah.
[39:37.340 --> 39:40.980]  Hey, did you notice in iOS 15,
[39:40.980 --> 39:44.020]  they are doing the watch unlock
[39:44.020 --> 39:46.580]  if you're wearing sunglasses that don't work with Face ID?
[39:46.580 --> 39:48.940]  Yes, I have not. It is incredible.
[39:48.940 --> 39:51.760]  I have not written about this on Daring Fireball yet,
[39:51.760 --> 39:56.760]  but as a longtime wearer of Ray-Ban sunglasses,
[39:58.060 --> 40:02.780]  and Ray-Ban notoriously has had their regular,
[40:03.820 --> 40:06.680]  non-polarized, just regular sunglasses,
[40:06.680 --> 40:08.400]  have never worked with Face ID,
[40:08.400 --> 40:10.360]  and they work now if you're wearing your Apple Watch,
[40:10.360 --> 40:11.800]  same way as the mask, and it's,
[40:13.080 --> 40:15.440]  I've been waiting to write about it on Daring Fireball
[40:15.440 --> 40:17.360]  because I'm terrible at,
[40:18.880 --> 40:21.880]  terrible at getting things out of my mind
[40:21.880 --> 40:25.400]  and onto the site as fast as I should, but it's awesome.
[40:25.400 --> 40:27.960]  And it's not as big a deal for me at the moment
[40:27.960 --> 40:30.280]  because I no longer wear contact lenses.
[40:30.280 --> 40:32.280]  I wear prescription glasses all the time,
[40:32.280 --> 40:36.480]  and my new prescription sunglasses aren't Ray-Ban lenses,
[40:36.480 --> 40:39.000]  so they actually work with Face ID,
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.920]  but my son took my Ray-Ban Wayfarers
[40:42.920 --> 40:45.320]  and has been annoyed as hell,
[40:45.320 --> 40:48.680]  and I was like, wait until you upgrade to iOS 15,
[40:48.680 --> 40:50.040]  it'll work, and he was like, what?
[40:50.040 --> 40:52.640]  And then it happened, and he was like, this is amazing.
[40:52.640 --> 40:53.480]  Yeah.
[40:53.480 --> 40:56.400]  It actually, I had stopped wearing my sunglasses as much.
[40:56.400 --> 40:58.200]  I realized, I'm just not,
[40:58.200 --> 41:00.360]  I was like, am I just getting older?
[41:00.360 --> 41:02.640]  No, it's actually, I just wanna unlock my phone more often.
[41:02.640 --> 41:04.200]  No, it was driving me nuts,
[41:04.200 --> 41:05.960]  and the mask thing was driving me nuts.
[41:05.960 --> 41:08.040]  It's great that they made it work both ways.
[41:08.040 --> 41:12.040]  I wish that they did the unlock with the iPads,
[41:12.040 --> 41:15.080]  the ones that, like the new iPad Mini
[41:15.080 --> 41:18.440]  and the iPad Air that have the Touch ID button,
[41:18.440 --> 41:21.040]  which is a huge pain in the ass, in my opinion.
[41:21.040 --> 41:25.080]  Like, once you're used to having a Face ID iPad
[41:25.080 --> 41:28.200]  that you just wake it up and you're in,
[41:28.200 --> 41:30.280]  I wish that, why can't,
[41:30.280 --> 41:33.040]  if I can unlock my phone while I'm wearing my watch
[41:33.040 --> 41:35.840]  and I can unlock my Mac while I'm wearing my watch,
[41:35.840 --> 41:37.960]  why can't I unlock this iPad?
[41:37.960 --> 41:41.040]  This would make the iPad Mini way more desirable,
[41:41.040 --> 41:42.120]  in my opinion.
[41:42.120 --> 41:43.760]  So hopefully that's on their list.
[41:43.760 --> 41:45.640]  The issue there is that sometimes the iPad
[41:45.640 --> 41:48.480]  is more often than not far away from you.
[41:48.480 --> 41:50.120]  I guess, but if it is,
[41:50.120 --> 41:53.560]  but oftentimes it's actually being held by the hand
[41:53.560 --> 41:55.360]  that's wearing the watch, right?
[41:55.360 --> 41:56.920]  That's true.
[41:56.920 --> 41:59.760]  Right, yeah, just the, right,
[41:59.760 --> 42:01.360]  think about like the, I don't know,
[42:01.360 --> 42:02.200]  you're in the pilots,
[42:02.200 --> 42:03.240]  every time I think about the iPad Mini,
[42:03.240 --> 42:04.080]  I think about pilots,
[42:04.080 --> 42:05.360]  because Apple loves the pilots using them.
[42:05.360 --> 42:06.200]  They do love the pilots.
[42:06.200 --> 42:07.040]  You're in the pilot's lounge
[42:07.040 --> 42:08.560]  and it's sitting on a couch and you're getting coffee,
[42:08.560 --> 42:09.680]  someone can unlock your iPad,
[42:09.680 --> 42:10.800]  cause you're around, right?
[42:10.800 --> 42:13.120]  Like that's the problem to solve.
[42:13.120 --> 42:14.520]  They do love the pilots.
[42:15.920 --> 42:17.920]  I mean, I honestly think they make the iPad Mini
[42:17.920 --> 42:19.800]  just cause I think it's so cool that pilots use them.
[42:19.800 --> 42:21.040]  I do too.
[42:21.040 --> 42:22.200]  I like the product.
[42:22.200 --> 42:23.200]  I think it's really neat,
[42:23.200 --> 42:25.520]  but it's like, it could never be my only iPad.
[42:25.520 --> 42:26.720]  When they first came out with it,
[42:26.720 --> 42:29.240]  it was like, I've crossed the border
[42:29.240 --> 42:31.360]  on my eyesight and my age
[42:31.360 --> 42:34.400]  where when like the first iPad Mini came out,
[42:34.400 --> 42:37.800]  my eyes were still really great at seeing really tiny type.
[42:37.800 --> 42:40.320]  And I was like, this is the most amazing iPad ever.
[42:40.320 --> 42:42.640]  And the phones were super small at the time too.
[42:42.640 --> 42:45.040]  They were still like 3.5 inch screens.
[42:46.160 --> 42:49.520]  So it seemed like a novel size class,
[42:49.520 --> 42:51.920]  you know, for like reading in bed.
[42:51.920 --> 42:53.200]  I liked the iPad Mini,
[42:53.200 --> 42:57.280]  but it probably couldn't be my only iPad.
[42:57.280 --> 42:59.080]  Did you, they sent you,
[42:59.080 --> 43:00.000]  when I was looking at Dieter's
[43:00.000 --> 43:02.240]  when we were at the code conference,
[43:02.240 --> 43:05.120]  the scroll delay, especially cause I was looking at,
[43:05.120 --> 43:07.320]  you know, I got the 13 Pro Max which is now at 120 Hertz,
[43:07.320 --> 43:09.000]  like ultra smooth.
[43:09.000 --> 43:10.480]  I'm used to my iPad Pro.
[43:11.520 --> 43:12.360]  I agree.
[43:12.360 --> 43:13.200]  I agree with Dieter.
[43:13.200 --> 43:14.400]  Like you can see it
[43:14.400 --> 43:17.080]  and it's not a deal breaker of a problem,
[43:18.880 --> 43:19.760]  but it's there, man.
[43:19.760 --> 43:20.800]  It's really weird.
[43:20.800 --> 43:21.640]  Yeah.
[43:21.640 --> 43:24.400]  So the jelly scroll issue is,
[43:24.400 --> 43:27.080]  and Dieter has, to his credit,
[43:27.080 --> 43:30.760]  illustrated it with precision, with like a slow,
[43:30.760 --> 43:33.120]  I tried to duplicate his slow motion video
[43:33.120 --> 43:33.960]  and I couldn't get it.
[43:33.960 --> 43:35.960]  I was like, I don't know how he did that,
[43:35.960 --> 43:37.720]  but you can definitely see it.
[43:37.720 --> 43:40.720]  So it's when you're only when you're holding it.
[43:40.720 --> 43:41.760]  In portrait.
[43:41.760 --> 43:42.600]  In portrait.
[43:42.600 --> 43:44.560]  It would be fine if it was in landscape.
[43:44.560 --> 43:45.400]  Right.
[43:45.400 --> 43:46.680]  Cause you're never really holding an iPad Mini
[43:46.680 --> 43:48.400]  in landscape, right?
[43:48.400 --> 43:50.280]  But in portrait, you can see it.
[43:50.280 --> 43:53.760]  And it is, it's a funny thing where
[43:55.000 --> 43:58.120]  the way that Apple arranges,
[43:58.120 --> 44:02.840]  the camera placement in particular suggests
[44:02.840 --> 44:05.920]  that even now in 2021,
[44:05.920 --> 44:09.560]  the one true orientation for an iPad is portrait
[44:09.560 --> 44:12.280]  because that's where the FaceTime camera is.
[44:12.280 --> 44:14.600]  And it's a bit weird
[44:14.600 --> 44:19.000]  because they sell these seemingly very popular
[44:19.000 --> 44:22.520]  turn your iPad into a laptop keyboard covers
[44:22.520 --> 44:24.840]  of ones with track pads,
[44:24.840 --> 44:28.240]  simpler ones that are just a keyboard without a track pad,
[44:28.240 --> 44:33.240]  which also is how a lot of people do their
[44:33.800 --> 44:37.400]  Zoom calls and Skype calls and FaceTime calls
[44:37.400 --> 44:39.480]  and whatever else they're using for work,
[44:39.480 --> 44:40.440]  which is a big deal.
[44:40.440 --> 44:41.960]  I don't know if you've heard.
[44:41.960 --> 44:46.320]  It's become a big deal over the last year and a half.
[44:46.320 --> 44:48.520]  They do it in laptop orientation.
[44:48.520 --> 44:52.800]  And it's really weird having your camera over there
[44:52.800 --> 44:55.280]  if you're in landscape.
[44:55.280 --> 44:59.200]  And, but I also think that there's a sort of,
[44:59.200 --> 45:00.040]  I think this day,
[45:00.040 --> 45:02.680]  I could be talking out of turn or misremembering,
[45:02.680 --> 45:06.400]  but I think it dates back to the original iPad
[45:06.400 --> 45:09.000]  all the way back in 2010,
[45:09.000 --> 45:12.080]  where there were rumors
[45:12.080 --> 45:13.960]  and I've spoken to people at Apple.
[45:13.960 --> 45:17.080]  It's true that they actually considered shipping it
[45:17.080 --> 45:21.080]  with two 30 port, 30 pin,
[45:21.080 --> 45:24.200]  the old pre-lightning, goofy port.
[45:24.200 --> 45:25.560]  There's prototypes for that.
[45:25.560 --> 45:26.800]  Yeah, I've seen the prototypes
[45:26.800 --> 45:28.680]  and I've spoken to people at Apple who said,
[45:28.680 --> 45:30.680]  we came really close to shipping it.
[45:30.680 --> 45:34.160]  And at the very end, Steve Jobs was just like,
[45:34.160 --> 45:35.040]  this is too,
[45:36.840 --> 45:39.840]  having two ports is too ugly, pick one.
[45:39.840 --> 45:41.600]  And like walked out of the room and they're like,
[45:41.600 --> 45:42.800]  ah, we got to pick one.
[45:44.080 --> 45:45.400]  But really it was like,
[45:45.400 --> 45:48.120]  it may be if Steve Jobs had been in a different mood
[45:48.120 --> 45:50.720]  on one particular day,
[45:50.720 --> 45:54.120]  the iPad might've had ports on both sides and supported it.
[45:54.120 --> 45:57.120]  But like the, from a developer's perspective,
[45:57.120 --> 45:59.320]  the orientation was,
[45:59.320 --> 46:04.000]  the true orientation at the developer level was landscape.
[46:04.000 --> 46:08.120]  And the fact that they made it seem like portrait
[46:08.120 --> 46:09.400]  was the true thing,
[46:09.400 --> 46:13.160]  was always sort of moving it, turning it 90 degrees.
[46:13.160 --> 46:14.960]  And I think that maybe that's what we're seeing
[46:14.960 --> 46:17.360]  with the iPad, this new iPad mini, right?
[46:17.360 --> 46:20.320]  Where it's in landscape and it never has any issue.
[46:20.320 --> 46:22.840]  Nobody can complain about the scrolling
[46:22.840 --> 46:27.040]  because that's the one true orientation for the display.
[46:27.040 --> 46:30.480]  And portrait is sort of a secondary mode.
[46:30.480 --> 46:32.680]  And of course the OS supports it.
[46:32.680 --> 46:35.000]  I think you can even, now they even do a better job
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.400]  of like letting you turn it completely upside down
[46:37.400 --> 46:40.680]  and put the lightning port sticking up and it still works.
[46:40.680 --> 46:43.720]  But I don't see the scrolling issue.
[46:43.720 --> 46:48.040]  And my son, who's 17, has really good eyesight,
[46:48.040 --> 46:51.280]  is very, very picky about things like frame rate,
[46:51.280 --> 46:56.280]  like actually prefers using an iPad
[46:56.320 --> 47:01.320]  to his MacBook Air because of the 120 hertz frame rate.
[47:02.240 --> 47:05.440]  He sees it, he perceives it, he really likes it.
[47:05.440 --> 47:09.040]  Even he thought when I showed him the mini,
[47:09.040 --> 47:12.760]  he was like, ah, I guess I see it, I don't really care.
[47:12.760 --> 47:14.680]  You know, what he really cares about
[47:14.680 --> 47:16.800]  is the fact that it's only 60 hertz, right?
[47:16.800 --> 47:18.640]  It's like, he's like, that's the issue,
[47:18.640 --> 47:21.920]  is that it's, I can see that it's only 60 hertz.
[47:21.920 --> 47:25.460]  The jelly part is, I don't know,
[47:25.460 --> 47:28.020]  I don't know what the negative version
[47:28.020 --> 47:29.280]  of icing on the cake is.
[47:30.120 --> 47:31.080]  You know, it's interesting.
[47:31.080 --> 47:32.880]  Dieter and I obviously review a lot of products together.
[47:32.880 --> 47:35.000]  We're always talking to each other.
[47:35.000 --> 47:37.440]  We're working on something else right now.
[47:37.440 --> 47:39.480]  And it is just really obvious to me
[47:39.480 --> 47:42.140]  that he is really sensitive to motion.
[47:42.140 --> 47:44.600]  Like he really cares about 120 hertz.
[47:44.600 --> 47:46.140]  He cares about that scroll stuff.
[47:46.140 --> 47:50.820]  And I am wildly sensitive to color, saturation,
[47:50.820 --> 47:54.220]  to off-axis shifts of brightness, right?
[47:54.220 --> 47:56.440]  There's a lot of bad panels out there
[47:56.440 --> 47:59.240]  where when you go off-axis, they drop in brightness.
[47:59.240 --> 48:00.680]  And for things you hold in your hand,
[48:00.680 --> 48:02.520]  you're kind of always off-axis.
[48:02.520 --> 48:05.880]  So I see that as a shimmer, right?
[48:05.880 --> 48:07.840]  Like I just see the display flickering at me
[48:07.840 --> 48:09.860]  because my hands are moving a little bit.
[48:09.860 --> 48:10.700]  And I'm like, look at this.
[48:10.700 --> 48:11.860]  And he's like, what are you talking about?
[48:11.860 --> 48:14.560]  And then he's like, man, 120 hertz, how can you get back?
[48:14.560 --> 48:17.680]  I'm like, I don't know, man, like I can sorta see it.
[48:17.680 --> 48:19.920]  And that, you know, I think that's the whole problem.
[48:19.920 --> 48:22.320]  Like it is impossible to communicate this stuff.
[48:22.320 --> 48:26.640]  It is very hard to take videos or photos of screens
[48:26.640 --> 48:27.800]  that you perceive with your eyes.
[48:27.800 --> 48:31.840]  Like now you're leaping through some camera sensor
[48:31.840 --> 48:33.720]  that's gonna do something weird,
[48:33.720 --> 48:35.520]  through some JPEG compression
[48:35.520 --> 48:37.440]  that's gonna do something weird,
[48:37.440 --> 48:41.320]  through Twitter just destroying a photo that's compressed.
[48:41.320 --> 48:43.880]  Like you're making all these steps.
[48:43.880 --> 48:44.720]  And then you're like,
[48:44.720 --> 48:45.880]  look at this thing that I perceive with my eyes
[48:45.880 --> 48:47.640]  and there's almost no way to communicate it.
[48:47.640 --> 48:48.920]  And then on top of that,
[48:48.920 --> 48:51.880]  different people care about wildly different aspects
[48:51.880 --> 48:53.260]  of display quality.
[48:53.260 --> 48:55.580]  And so to me, it's like, yeah, I don't,
[48:55.580 --> 48:57.880]  the motion is a thing, but if you're like,
[48:57.880 --> 48:59.640]  you know, a Samsung phone out of the box
[48:59.640 --> 49:01.820]  and it's like wildly oversaturated,
[49:02.840 --> 49:04.880]  I'm just like, I can't even look at this.
[49:05.800 --> 49:09.240]  I used to think, I think my eyes are a lot like yours.
[49:09.240 --> 49:12.180]  The motion stuff doesn't, never has bothered me as much.
[49:12.180 --> 49:16.700]  I like the fact that the phone has the true,
[49:16.700 --> 49:17.960]  what do I call it, true motion?
[49:17.960 --> 49:18.800]  No.
[49:19.960 --> 49:20.800]  ProMotion.
[49:20.800 --> 49:21.620]  ProMotion, right.
[49:21.620 --> 49:25.280]  Cause I knew it was, it's without the camel case,
[49:25.280 --> 49:28.980]  it's indistinguishable from like the word promotion.
[49:31.240 --> 49:35.000]  I can kind of see it, to me, the big benefit
[49:35.000 --> 49:38.120]  is that it clearly seems to extend battery life
[49:38.120 --> 49:40.280]  when you're watching 30 frames per second
[49:40.280 --> 49:41.960]  or 24 frames per second video,
[49:41.960 --> 49:45.020]  because it drops the refresh rate of the display to match
[49:45.020 --> 49:46.880]  and it really seems to extend battery life.
[49:46.880 --> 49:49.980]  The fact that it goes above 60, I can kind of see it,
[49:49.980 --> 49:50.820]  but I don't care.
[49:50.820 --> 49:55.240]  Cause I'm still like, you could read a scrolling article
[49:55.240 --> 49:56.480]  as you're scrolling it now,
[49:56.480 --> 49:57.960]  but I don't read that way anyway.
[49:57.960 --> 50:00.040]  I scroll first and then I go back to reading.
[50:00.040 --> 50:00.920]  So I don't care.
[50:00.920 --> 50:02.360]  I'm like you, I see the color
[50:02.360 --> 50:06.600]  and like in the early days of Android phones going OLED
[50:06.600 --> 50:08.640]  when they were super oversaturated,
[50:08.640 --> 50:10.540]  I'd be like, how can, you know, you don't see this
[50:10.540 --> 50:11.880]  and some people would be like,
[50:11.880 --> 50:12.920]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[50:12.920 --> 50:13.760]  I'm like, look at this.
[50:13.760 --> 50:15.920]  Some people will be like, I do see it and I love it.
[50:15.920 --> 50:18.080]  Right, or right, right, vice versa, right?
[50:18.080 --> 50:20.760]  Where they'd, you'd be like, look at this guy's red shirt.
[50:20.760 --> 50:22.640]  It's like burning your eyeballs
[50:22.640 --> 50:24.720]  and they'd be like, yeah, that's awesome.
[50:24.720 --> 50:26.760]  Burn me.
[50:26.760 --> 50:29.520]  Yeah, I mean, that's like every TV, you know,
[50:29.520 --> 50:33.040]  ships with insane settings because they know
[50:33.040 --> 50:34.720]  that's what people, people always pick brighter
[50:34.720 --> 50:36.800]  and they will always pick louder.
[50:36.800 --> 50:39.240]  Or people don't care at all, or people don't care at all.
[50:39.240 --> 50:40.860]  So why not turn up the brightness?
[50:40.860 --> 50:43.320]  Because the people who don't care will buy it anyway
[50:43.320 --> 50:44.840]  and the people who are attracted to it,
[50:44.840 --> 50:46.600]  like moths to a light bulb,
[50:47.960 --> 50:49.560]  are gonna be like, give me that TV.
[50:49.560 --> 50:50.720]  I want the one where everybody
[50:50.720 --> 50:52.280]  looks like they're radioactive.
[50:53.820 --> 50:57.440]  Yeah, I mean, I just, there's like an element to,
[50:57.440 --> 50:58.960]  you know, I'm thinking about what you're saying
[50:58.960 --> 51:00.720]  about the one true orientation iPad.
[51:00.720 --> 51:02.380]  Like they're way past that, right?
[51:02.380 --> 51:04.800]  They know the iPad mini,
[51:04.800 --> 51:06.680]  like they're making their own marketing materials
[51:06.680 --> 51:09.160]  showing the mini in portrait all the time.
[51:09.160 --> 51:12.200]  Yeah, and like using a mini in landscape
[51:12.200 --> 51:14.560]  is like a challenging project,
[51:14.560 --> 51:16.020]  unless you're playing a game.
[51:16.020 --> 51:17.560]  Yeah, it's like that screen is small,
[51:17.560 --> 51:21.540]  iPad OS to its credit supports it well,
[51:21.540 --> 51:24.880]  but it's still like, it's, there's like weirdness still
[51:24.880 --> 51:26.520]  cause it's a much smaller display
[51:26.520 --> 51:27.800]  as the rest of the iPads have gotten bigger
[51:27.800 --> 51:28.920]  and bigger and bigger.
[51:30.140 --> 51:31.500]  They know it's in portrait.
[51:31.500 --> 51:35.020]  I don't, I think that this is like a packaging question
[51:35.020 --> 51:37.160]  that they kind of just didn't think people would notice
[51:37.160 --> 51:38.800]  and we definitely noticed.
[51:38.800 --> 51:41.920]  But I agree with Dieter, it's not the end of the world,
[51:41.920 --> 51:43.320]  but I am not, as I've been saying,
[51:43.320 --> 51:45.280]  I'm not as sensitive to motion.
[51:45.280 --> 51:49.280]  I wonder too, and it's so hard to say,
[51:49.280 --> 51:53.040]  but I wonder is it a coincidence or not
[51:53.040 --> 51:57.760]  that this iPad mini was almost certainly developed
[51:57.760 --> 52:00.040]  largely in the COVID era?
[52:00.040 --> 52:03.240]  And did it mean that fewer people saw,
[52:03.240 --> 52:05.320]  it was exposed to fewer people
[52:05.320 --> 52:09.000]  and if whatever the percentage of people who care
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.840]  and let's just say that everybody who works at Apple
[52:11.840 --> 52:16.200]  and would see prototype iPads in development care
[52:16.200 --> 52:19.640]  about details that not enough people saw it for them
[52:19.640 --> 52:23.680]  to hit the minority of people
[52:23.680 --> 52:27.640]  who see this jelly scrolling and are like sickened by it.
[52:28.500 --> 52:30.000]  I wonder.
[52:30.000 --> 52:30.840]  Yeah, I don't know.
[52:30.840 --> 52:31.660]  I mean, maybe this is when Apple
[52:31.660 --> 52:32.880]  wants everybody back in the office.
[52:32.880 --> 52:36.600]  I don't know, but you have to know.
[52:36.600 --> 52:39.840]  I mean, we put the display controller over here
[52:39.840 --> 52:42.480]  so that side of the display will update later.
[52:43.760 --> 52:46.240]  I mean, that's just like well-known, right?
[52:46.240 --> 52:47.920]  That's a design trade-off
[52:47.920 --> 52:51.320]  that you know you're walking into from the jump.
[52:51.320 --> 52:54.500]  But if you do it and then you show it to 20 people
[52:54.500 --> 52:56.800]  and all 20 people that are like,
[52:56.800 --> 52:58.080]  yeah, that looks fine to me,
[52:58.080 --> 52:59.760]  which is what I think when I look
[52:59.760 --> 53:01.800]  at the iPad mini review unit
[53:01.800 --> 53:03.760]  that I still have up in my kitchen,
[53:03.760 --> 53:05.120]  I still, every couple of days,
[53:05.120 --> 53:07.120]  think like, huh, let me try it on this page
[53:07.120 --> 53:09.240]  and scroll and I don't see it.
[53:12.040 --> 53:13.760]  But I don't, it's just like you were saying
[53:13.760 --> 53:14.600]  a couple of minutes ago.
[53:14.600 --> 53:16.120]  I don't doubt the people who see it
[53:16.120 --> 53:18.840]  and find it disgusting or revolting
[53:18.840 --> 53:22.700]  or that it actually gives them a bit of motion sickness
[53:22.700 --> 53:23.540]  or something like that.
[53:23.540 --> 53:25.680]  I don't dispute that just because I don't see it
[53:25.680 --> 53:27.560]  because I know that I see things sometimes
[53:27.560 --> 53:28.960]  that other people don't see.
[53:28.960 --> 53:32.000]  Yeah, or maybe it's as simple as, look,
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.240]  most of the popular apps or pilots
[53:34.240 --> 53:35.920]  or single screens and you can scroll a lot
[53:35.920 --> 53:37.080]  and they know that's the market.
[53:37.080 --> 53:40.800]  Like, there's a million ways you make this decision.
[53:40.800 --> 53:43.120]  I just, I've come to the conclusion,
[53:43.120 --> 53:45.240]  especially with the big tech companies
[53:45.240 --> 53:47.800]  and the products that make a lot of money
[53:47.800 --> 53:48.880]  for those big tech companies,
[53:48.880 --> 53:50.280]  that there are no accidents, right?
[53:50.280 --> 53:54.040]  Like, this is, you know, not to plug my own show,
[53:54.040 --> 53:56.440]  but like I spend all of Decoder as me asking people
[53:56.440 --> 53:57.520]  how to make decisions.
[53:57.520 --> 54:00.280]  Like, how do you make these trade-offs?
[54:00.280 --> 54:04.640]  And no one ever says we were surprised
[54:04.640 --> 54:06.000]  by a trade-off we saw coming.
[54:06.000 --> 54:08.040]  They all say this is, we saw it coming
[54:08.040 --> 54:09.280]  and there were two right answers
[54:09.280 --> 54:10.240]  and we picked the one that we thought
[54:10.240 --> 54:11.080]  was slightly more right.
[54:11.080 --> 54:15.800]  And in a case like this, Apple's really good at displays.
[54:15.800 --> 54:17.680]  Like, I still think they're the best company
[54:17.680 --> 54:20.160]  when it comes to just overall display quality.
[54:20.160 --> 54:22.720]  And I think a decision like this, they know.
[54:22.720 --> 54:24.600]  They knew from the beginning
[54:24.600 --> 54:26.160]  and I think they thought the trade-off was worth it
[54:26.160 --> 54:28.200]  and I think people probably have to,
[54:28.200 --> 54:29.040]  like you're saying with the colors,
[54:29.040 --> 54:30.200]  you gotta go see it for yourself.
[54:30.200 --> 54:32.920]  But on balance, it's not like a deal breaker.
[54:32.920 --> 54:37.920]  Yeah, and like the Mini and the iPad Air
[54:37.920 --> 54:41.920]  exist in a weird mid-range zone
[54:41.920 --> 54:44.800]  that Apple doesn't typically have, right?
[54:44.800 --> 54:49.400]  They're not the $329 entry model iPad,
[54:49.400 --> 54:53.160]  which to me was so interesting how they emphasized
[54:53.160 --> 54:55.080]  over and over and over and over,
[54:55.080 --> 54:59.480]  and over like ad nauseam last month
[54:59.480 --> 55:02.160]  that it's their best-selling model, best-selling model.
[55:02.160 --> 55:04.280]  And it seemed curious to me that they kept saying
[55:04.280 --> 55:05.880]  that it was their best-selling iPad
[55:05.880 --> 55:07.680]  because it is the cheapest, you know?
[55:07.680 --> 55:10.920]  Like for some reason though, they want everybody to know
[55:10.920 --> 55:13.920]  that that's their best-selling model, you know?
[55:13.920 --> 55:16.000]  Oh, that's because of Chromebooks.
[55:16.000 --> 55:17.400]  I guess, right?
[55:17.400 --> 55:21.720]  Right, there's the iPad Pro at the top competes
[55:21.720 --> 55:24.000]  with Windows laptops, right?
[55:24.000 --> 55:24.840]  Right.
[55:24.840 --> 55:27.480]  At the bottom, it's Chromebooks,
[55:27.480 --> 55:30.920]  and they need people to know that they are putting up
[55:30.920 --> 55:33.840]  not only a fight, but sometimes winning the fight
[55:33.840 --> 55:36.440]  against Chromebooks because, man,
[55:36.440 --> 55:40.720]  we have done so much coverage of education in the pandemic,
[55:40.720 --> 55:43.400]  and Chromebooks are dominant to a point
[55:43.400 --> 55:45.760]  where they are changing how kids think
[55:45.760 --> 55:48.680]  about computers as a whole, right?
[55:48.680 --> 55:50.480]  Did you see our story about files and folders?
[55:50.480 --> 55:51.760]  Yep, I did, I love that.
[55:51.760 --> 55:53.860]  Like that is a story about Google,
[55:53.860 --> 55:56.600]  but it's a story about Google Docs.
[55:56.600 --> 55:58.000]  You know, it's a story about Apple.
[55:58.000 --> 55:59.840]  Apple also abstracts the file system,
[55:59.840 --> 56:01.180]  but you kind of like dig into it.
[56:01.180 --> 56:02.880]  You're like, oh, these kids have,
[56:02.880 --> 56:04.880]  they all get Chromebooks when they show up in school.
[56:04.880 --> 56:08.240]  Like it is a pretty universal experience now.
[56:08.240 --> 56:11.920]  They all get Google accounts, and Apple needs to like win
[56:11.920 --> 56:14.940]  because otherwise you're living a life with Google
[56:14.940 --> 56:16.400]  for the rest of your life.
[56:16.400 --> 56:19.840]  I thought that the story, I will,
[56:19.840 --> 56:21.040]  I'm making a note right now.
[56:21.040 --> 56:22.360]  I will get it into the show notes
[56:22.360 --> 56:23.560]  because it was a great story,
[56:23.560 --> 56:27.160]  but the gist of it is that there's an entire generation now
[56:27.160 --> 56:29.960]  that largely doesn't understand
[56:29.960 --> 56:33.400]  how to use a hierarchical file system,
[56:33.400 --> 56:36.400]  and they don't really think about their,
[56:36.400 --> 56:39.960]  they don't really think about files as files
[56:39.960 --> 56:44.100]  the way that people who grew up in an earlier time had to,
[56:44.100 --> 56:46.440]  whether they were computer enthusiasts or not.
[56:46.440 --> 56:50.120]  You know, like just go back to the floppy era, right,
[56:50.120 --> 56:50.960]  with floppy net.
[56:50.960 --> 56:54.560]  Like when, you know, if you remember using computers
[56:54.560 --> 56:56.800]  in the 90s when most computers weren't connected
[56:56.800 --> 56:58.660]  to each other by any kind of network,
[56:58.660 --> 57:02.480]  to get a file from computer A to computer B,
[57:02.480 --> 57:05.340]  put it on a floppy disk, take the floppy disk over,
[57:05.340 --> 57:06.600]  put it in the other computer,
[57:06.600 --> 57:08.840]  and then move the file from the floppy disk
[57:08.840 --> 57:10.520]  to the computer's hard drive.
[57:10.520 --> 57:12.360]  You had to, you know,
[57:12.360 --> 57:14.240]  even that level of understanding of it,
[57:14.240 --> 57:16.560]  it doesn't even make sense to kids today,
[57:16.560 --> 57:17.900]  which is really interesting.
[57:17.900 --> 57:21.280]  Well, I think about, you know, Apple, like,
[57:21.280 --> 57:24.320]  Macs didn't have search, Windows PCs didn't have search.
[57:24.320 --> 57:28.200]  The primary method that we all use computers with now
[57:28.200 --> 57:31.800]  is search, like, I launch every app on my Mac
[57:31.800 --> 57:33.920]  with Spotlight, right, it's just what I do.
[57:33.920 --> 57:36.480]  It's the doctor Spotlight all day long.
[57:36.480 --> 57:39.200]  I launch almost every app on my phone with Spotlight now,
[57:39.200 --> 57:41.360]  which is a really weird thing to think about.
[57:41.360 --> 57:43.600]  The idea that I need to know where any of this thing is
[57:43.600 --> 57:45.360]  in storage is gone.
[57:45.360 --> 57:47.560]  Now, I grew up in the same area as you.
[57:47.560 --> 57:49.200]  I had, I actually, I had zip disks.
[57:49.200 --> 57:52.960]  I had one zip disk for work, for school stuff.
[57:52.960 --> 57:55.880]  I had one zip disk for, like, random creative stuff.
[57:55.880 --> 57:59.300]  Like, yeah, I needed to know where stuff was.
[57:59.300 --> 58:01.800]  But, like, if you're a kid now,
[58:01.800 --> 58:04.020]  there's almost no reason for you to know
[58:04.020 --> 58:05.360]  how your file's organized.
[58:05.360 --> 58:06.820]  So our story was,
[58:06.820 --> 58:11.440]  once you enter higher-level STEM classes in college,
[58:11.440 --> 58:12.960]  you're generating an awful lot of data,
[58:12.960 --> 58:14.120]  that data is in files,
[58:14.120 --> 58:17.720]  and all these college professors are realizing
[58:17.720 --> 58:19.320]  they have to do, like,
[58:19.320 --> 58:21.720]  here's how a directory structure works
[58:21.720 --> 58:25.480]  so the kids can do their homework in college,
[58:25.480 --> 58:27.480]  which is just wild to think about.
[58:27.480 --> 58:29.040]  And it's been going on for years,
[58:29.040 --> 58:32.400]  and I can kind of trace it to, in our story,
[58:32.400 --> 58:36.220]  you can trace it to the advent of the iPad and the Chromebook
[58:36.220 --> 58:37.720]  because those are the, that's the moment
[58:37.720 --> 58:40.060]  when file systems are just, like, fully abstracted away.
[58:40.060 --> 58:44.340]  Yeah, and not just the iPad, the iPhone, right, I mean,
[58:44.340 --> 58:45.520]  because the iPhone, I think,
[58:45.520 --> 58:48.760]  even got the Files app later than iPad,
[58:48.760 --> 58:51.280]  or if it did, it was less of a big deal, right?
[58:51.280 --> 58:54.220]  And even the Files app,
[58:54.220 --> 58:57.100]  which lets you file stuff away hierarchically,
[58:57.100 --> 59:00.880]  still sort of defaults to a recent files view,
[59:00.880 --> 59:03.320]  you know, where it just shows you any of the recent files
[59:03.320 --> 59:05.320]  that you've accessed from anywhere.
[59:05.320 --> 59:09.380]  And it gets, it sort of gets to outlining
[59:09.380 --> 59:11.100]  and using a real outliner,
[59:11.100 --> 59:14.060]  not just, like, the outline mode in Microsoft Word
[59:14.060 --> 59:17.380]  or Apple Notes, where if you start making bullet points,
[59:17.380 --> 59:19.340]  you get, like, automatic indentation,
[59:19.340 --> 59:21.700]  but a true outliner with flippy widgets
[59:21.700 --> 59:24.460]  where you can collapse parts of the outline
[59:24.460 --> 59:29.460]  and think in terms of major topics, minor topics,
[59:30.780 --> 59:32.980]  here's the actual content within the minor topic
[59:32.980 --> 59:34.060]  three levels in,
[59:34.060 --> 59:36.140]  and that's, you know, if your files
[59:36.140 --> 59:37.660]  are actually well-organized,
[59:37.660 --> 59:39.460]  or even somewhat well-organized,
[59:39.460 --> 59:41.820]  that's how you have your files structured.
[59:42.700 --> 59:45.460]  And the kids just, they just don't even think like that now.
[59:45.460 --> 59:46.700]  It just doesn't even occur,
[59:46.700 --> 59:48.940]  it's not that they're, they're not dumb,
[59:48.940 --> 59:50.700]  they just have never thought to do it.
[59:50.700 --> 59:52.660]  They just, their stuff is all just there,
[59:52.660 --> 59:56.020]  and you just search the name of it, and it comes up.
[59:56.020 --> 59:57.780]  So Monica Chin wrote this story for us.
[59:57.780 --> 59:58.620]  She did a great job.
[59:58.620 --> 01:00:00.540]  When I pitched her the story,
[01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:02.340]  I was like, I'm looking up,
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:05.900]  looking up, you know, there's like a half-viral thread
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:07.020]  from a professor on Twitter,
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:07.860]  and I was like, you should chase it,
[01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:08.820]  this is really interesting.
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:11.020]  And she's like, I don't use directory structure,
[01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:12.380]  she's much younger than me.
[01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:14.180]  So she was perfect to write it.
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:17.020]  But in the story, which I know people read,
[01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:19.720]  she says all these professors can point specifically
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:22.220]  to 2017, and it started happening,
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:25.100]  and she's like, most of 2017's college freshmen
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:26.180]  were born in the late 90s,
[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:28.180]  they were in elementary school when the iPhone came out,
[01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:29.940]  they are around the same age as Google.
[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:33.580]  So they have never experienced a world of computers
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:35.060]  that doesn't have search,
[01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:37.300]  and hasn't abstracted the file system away.
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:40.280]  So their mental models for how computers work
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:41.880]  are entirely search-based.
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.420]  There was actually someone,
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:47.140]  I apologize for not remembering who it was,
[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:51.120]  but somebody who worked on Bertrand Cerlet's team at Apple
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.060]  in the very beginning said,
[01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:56.000]  like Bertrand Cerlet was hot, like hot,
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.820]  that this was the future, that search was the future.
[01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:00.820]  And there's a great video of Steve Jobs actually
[01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:04.020]  demoing Spotlight to Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher
[01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:06.660]  at an early D conference, and he's like,
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:08.940]  why is the face of our computer the finder?
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:11.340]  The second we start trying to explain the finder to people,
[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:12.940]  the learning curve goes up.
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:14.500]  So we're just gonna make it all search.
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:18.020]  And there's like a direct line from that to now.
[01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:21.420]  It is, and the irony, of course, as a long-time user,
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:22.500]  it goes without saying,
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.740]  is that the name of the Mac file manager
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:26.760]  has always been finder,
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.260]  and literally lacked a find files command
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:32.960]  until like some point in system eight,
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.420]  you know, like 13, 14 years into the platform's life,
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:38.600]  did it have like built-in file search
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:42.100]  that was actually useful, which is ridiculous.
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:47.100]  Like, the assumption was that you were so familiar
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:48.580]  with how your files were organized
[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:51.660]  that you wouldn't need to actually search for them.
[01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:52.500]  It's-
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:53.460]  Yeah, it boggled my mind.
[01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:57.540]  Yet the name was called finder.
[01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:58.420]  I think it's really interesting, right,
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:00.660]  that they're much better at, like, you know,
[01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:02.100]  college students are much better at doing things
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:05.420]  with computers in some ways than I will ever be,
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:07.660]  or people of my generation will ever be.
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:09.180]  Like, the idea that, you know,
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:12.700]  like TikTok is like a video-native communication system.
[01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:13.540]  Yeah.
[01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:17.360]  And like, that is, I have to make my brain
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.520]  not think about Adobe Premiere when I look at TikTok
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.420]  and how it is made.
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:25.060]  Like, that is how my understanding
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:28.080]  of how video is created, is like,
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.300]  there's a timeline and you layer things in the timeline,
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:33.100]  and that is Premiere, and to some extent that is iMovie,
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:35.740]  and that's Final Cut, and then TikTok is like,
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:38.280]  no, it's just a bunch of weird, crazy AI stuff.
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:39.260]  Yeah.
[01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:41.140]  And like, you think about these models
[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:42.180]  and these metaphors we use,
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:46.140]  and it's fascinating to think about what I have prioritized
[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:48.540]  and what, if you have none of this baggage,
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:49.860]  what you will prioritize.
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:53.340]  And yet, the, I'm with you, where I can't really think
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.780]  in terms of the TikTok editing interface,
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:57.020]  it doesn't really make sense to me,
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:01.140]  but I totally see and am fascinated by the fact
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:05.380]  that this entire generation intuitively,
[01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:07.700]  without any formal training at all,
[01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:10.960]  just speaks the language of cinema.
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:11.940]  Yeah.
[01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:14.140]  And edits, you know, like,
[01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:17.620]  and I grew up in an era when everybody,
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:20.140]  when I was a kid, wanted to watch as much TV
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:21.980]  as their parents would possibly allow,
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:23.280]  and we love going to movies,
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:26.940]  and, you know, video is just a super compelling format.
[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:28.060]  It always has been.
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:32.780]  Even when your best option at four o'clock in the afternoon
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:36.500]  is Brady Bunch reruns that you've already seen,
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.700]  and it's a show that kind of sucked anyway
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:41.340]  and is chock full of, you know,
[01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:44.500]  nine minutes of commercials for every half hour
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:46.100]  that you can't skip or fast forward,
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:47.860]  you'd still just sit there and watch it.
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:51.340]  But it's like, my generation didn't intuitively learn
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:56.340]  to think about cuts and editing and closeups and long shots
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:04:00.640]  and the way that you can bring about a humorous moment
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.860]  or a punchline through editing,
[01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:04.820]  whereas that's all TikTok is.
[01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:06.580]  Yeah, right, what is that?
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:10.180]  That is, it's easy to not think hard
[01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.740]  about what you're consuming.
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:14.660]  It is even easier to think really hard
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:16.060]  about what you're making.
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:19.020]  And so that, to me, is like, yep, that's the promise.
[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:22.740]  There's some great quote when iMovie first came out, right?
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:26.340]  Like Steve Jobs enlisted Scorsese
[01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:29.740]  or with some famous director, like Spielberg,
[01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:32.860]  it was somewhere in that zone, and they were like,
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:35.800]  this is the tool that's going to make the kids destroy me.
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.460]  I don't know if that's happened, right?
[01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:39.460]  It is definitely true in many ways, right?
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:42.260]  But you just draw a line from there,
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:44.140]  iMovie coming out with FireWire
[01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:47.180]  and eight-millimeter cameras and all that.
[01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:51.400]  I spent a lot of time downloading video
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.840]  off an eight-millimeter.
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.440]  Remember those tiny eight-millimeter tapes
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:55.460]  over FireWire to my Mac?
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:05:00.460]  Yes, yeah, there was Super 8 and then High 8.
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:03.620]  It was High 8, that's what it was.
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:04.460]  High 8.
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:06.580]  Now we're just dating ourselves.
[01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:07.980]  But anyway, but you draw a line from that
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:11.260]  to every kid speaks the language of video
[01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:12.220]  in editing in that way,
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:14.000]  and that's exactly what they were talking about back then.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.780]  Like just democratizing creation.
[01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:17.780]  Yeah, I took a course in college.
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:20.380]  This would be like 1995, 96.
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:24.140]  And what was the name of the editing program?
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:26.100]  I think they effectively disappeared.
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:29.740]  It was, they were Avid's arch rival at the time.
[01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:31.200]  Oh, I have no idea.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:32.700]  Well, whatever it was.
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:34.100]  It worked, it was cool.
[01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:36.900]  It had a really cool Mac user interface.
[01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:38.820]  You know, like the way that audio software
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:40.980]  and video editing software has always sort of been
[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:45.500]  at the forward edge of like just cool sci-fi,
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:47.780]  futuristic looking user interface design.
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:50.380]  But it would crash every 90 seconds.
[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.820]  And it was fine because you would, you know,
[01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:54.440]  and they knew it was gonna crash,
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.420]  but you never lost data, right?
[01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:57.900]  It was like, they were always, you know,
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:00.540]  like you'd be moving tracks along your timeline
[01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:01.620]  and then the app would crash
[01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:03.980]  and you'd wait for it to relaunch
[01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:04.820]  and it would take a while
[01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:06.780]  because it was the 90s and computers were slow.
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:08.140]  But then you'd be right back where you were
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:10.580]  and you just accepted it because it was amazing
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:13.980]  because you were doing non-linear video editing.
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:16.300]  You know, you didn't have to cut pieces of film
[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.460]  and splice them together with tape.
[01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:22.060]  You were actually able to like make an edit, watch it
[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:23.660]  and say, no, actually, you know,
[01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:26.860]  maybe we should go like half a second later, you know?
[01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:28.700]  And then it was totally non-destructive
[01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:30.620]  and it was mind blowing and then it would crash
[01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:34.260]  and you'd go relaunch it and go onto the next one.
[01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:36.500]  It's funny, speaking of TikTok,
[01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:37.820]  I saw a great TikTok the other day.
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:40.700]  I have an old school audio engineer
[01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:43.500]  and he was demonstrating how to do it,
[01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:46.380]  an old school tape splice where he's like,
[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:49.460]  we want to make this drum intro shorter.
[01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:52.380]  So I'm going to wind the tape past the play head.
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:55.340]  I'm going to cut it and I'm going to tape
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:58.620]  in another piece of tape and do you even hear the splice?
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:01.340]  And all the comments are obviously like TikTok people
[01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:03.500]  being like, are you kidding?
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:06.580]  Like, why don't you just use a computer?
[01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:08.020]  He's like, no, we couldn't.
[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:10.020]  This was a very manual process.
[01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:12.540]  I actually did that because I did,
[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:13.980]  in college I took a course.
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:15.180]  That's where I confused Hi8.
[01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:18.020]  It was, Super 8 was the actual film.
[01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:20.180]  Super 8, you would shoot on film
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:23.940]  and it didn't even have sound, but it was amazing.
[01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:26.140]  But I've got like home movies of me from the 70s
[01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:29.300]  when I was like a toddler that my uncle shot
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:33.140]  because he was the one I got the nerd gene from,
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:34.580]  but he had a Super 8 camera.
[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:37.660]  But in college, it was like at the cusp
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:41.820]  or like a second course we did video and non-linear editing.
[01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:43.900]  But I took a course where we shot short films
[01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:46.300]  using actual Super 8 video
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:48.300]  and had to splice them together that way.
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:52.660]  You'd make actual cuts and then use like a high grade
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:55.780]  scotch tape that would splice them together.
[01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:59.420]  So I got to ask you in the midst of this conversation,
[01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:02.420]  how are you feeling about cinematic mode on the 13s?
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:06.620]  I can't get impressive results out of it,
[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:10.100]  but I've seen enough footage from people who are talented.
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:13.980]  You know, that movie, what was it called that I linked to?
[01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:15.100]  It was awesome.
[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:17.460]  It was an incredible short movie that was shot with it.
[01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:20.060]  And I've seen a couple of other YouTubers
[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:22.580]  and I really value the YouTubers perspective
[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:24.420]  because they know way more about video.
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:27.620]  You know, they forget more about video than I'll ever know.
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:29.060]  And they're pretty positive about it.
[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:31.780]  And I also think that the ones who I think get it
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:34.700]  and see where Apple's going also emphasize,
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:36.740]  I've seen several YouTubers emphasize,
[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:38.740]  if you're watching it on a phone,
[01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:41.060]  you don't see the problems with it.
[01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:42.740]  It just looks cool.
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:45.260]  And that's where most people watch this stuff.
[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:48.420]  So I'm bullish on,
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:50.940]  I'm more bullish on cinematic mode
[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:56.060]  at its debut right now than I was about portrait mode
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:59.020]  for still photography five or six years ago
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:00.940]  when they first introduced it.
[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:04.500]  Yeah, I would say last year with the 12
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:06.940]  is when they got me with portrait mode on the phone
[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:08.660]  for the stills.
[01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:10.020]  And I was like, I'm just gonna start using this.
[01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:13.740]  And what I actually noticed was my wife started using a lot,
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:15.060]  which I thought is fascinating, right?
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:16.700]  They got real close.
[01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:19.060]  It's still, it can be weird in some places,
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:20.780]  but like on balance, it looks really good.
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:21.620]  I like using it.
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:24.180]  You know, every video I've seen
[01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:26.220]  of cinematic mode looking good,
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:28.240]  it's from people who own lights.
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:33.240]  And I think this is like the gap for me.
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.960]  Like if you give me a light kit,
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:39.320]  I can make any camera look good, right?
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:43.240]  Like that, and this to me is like the first,
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:44.720]  I pulled this phone out of the box
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.120]  and I went and used cinematic mode.
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:47.320]  And the first thing it said to me
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:49.000]  was there's not enough light in this room.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.760]  And I was like, it's the middle of the day, right?
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.080]  Yep, I was like downstairs.
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.920]  I was like near a window, but not like next to the window.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:59.000]  But it was just not a situation where I expected
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.920]  a camera to tell me there wasn't enough light, you know?
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:04.280]  Yeah, and that to me is,
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:07.080]  yep, I can make anything look good with enough light.
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:12.080]  I think they, you know, they introduced HDR last year.
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:14.520]  Those workflows are still pretty complicated.
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:17.880]  You know, like a lot of people want to turn them off
[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:21.880]  for a variety of reasons, even though I like HDR video.
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:22.960]  And you know, like you said,
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.160]  most people watch this stuff on the phone,
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.560]  looks on the phone.
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:27.520]  Cinematic mode is like another set
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:30.140]  of file format complications, right?
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:31.640]  You can only edit it in Apple's apps.
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:32.520]  You can only do this.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.840]  And on top of it, I just, I think it doesn't work well
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:36.940]  unless you light it really well.
[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:37.780]  To the point where, you know,
[01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:41.800]  DDR talk, like Apple's ads are pretty moody.
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:43.640]  And if you just thought you could do that
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:46.280]  and you know, lit by it, you know,
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:49.660]  their Knives app parody is like all firelight and candles.
[01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:50.900]  There's no way this thing works
[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:52.760]  if you're just lighting your firelight and candles.
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:56.360]  And the other one I see all the time on football games
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.800]  is like an Old West scene with gunslingers
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:04.220]  in a very moodily lit, dark saloon type,
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:08.680]  you know, typical Wild West trope.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:09.600]  Yeah.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:10.800]  And of course at the bottom it says
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:11.920]  additional equipment was used.
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:12.740]  I was like, oh, lights.
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:16.200]  What you mean is lights, which is interesting.
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.740]  I don't think it's unfair.
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:19.660]  I mean, I do think, I think it's a fair thing
[01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:21.260]  that they're saying we actually shot this
[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:24.340]  with an iPhone 13, you know, using our cinematic mode.
[01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:28.540]  This is actual footage, but it is different.
[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:30.820]  And I remember talking to Phil Schiller about it
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:35.820]  multiple times where with their still photography examples
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:39.720]  over the years, they never, it was a religious rule,
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:42.040]  no artificial lights, you know,
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:45.060]  that is, you know, we want to be able to say
[01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:48.520]  when we show this photo, this was not post-processed,
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:49.800]  this is straight off the phone
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:51.960]  and we didn't use artificial lights, you know,
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:56.960]  and there would be some really, really just, you know,
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:00.360]  every, you know, as cell phone cameras have gotten better
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.960]  and the state of the art has gotten better,
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:06.960]  there's always examples that the Apple and Google
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:11.840]  and Samsung can show shot by very talented photographers
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.720]  where you're just like, it's hard to believe
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:15.520]  that this was taken with a phone,
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:18.680]  but Apple would not use artificial lights and rigs
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:20.040]  and stuff like that to get them.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:22.120]  But, you know, they have to with cinematic mode
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.120]  to get the results that they're showing.
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.320]  Yeah, I can't see how you do otherwise.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:29.240]  I'm, you know, I'm curious about it, I like playing with it.
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:33.380]  I do think that if you just look at the data
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:37.320]  that camera generates now, like the way it generates it,
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:42.100]  with photos, you have multiple file formats
[01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:43.480]  all bundled into a thing, right?
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:47.000]  You've got live photos, which tiny video file,
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.300]  you can shoot in photographic styles
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.040]  and that only outputs as JPEGs,
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.600]  you can't get RAWs off of that.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:57.060]  You've got RAW, SmartRAW from Apple.
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:00.960]  Like there's a lot of ways to engage the camera now
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.240]  just for stills.
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:04.720]  And then now there's an increasing number of ways
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:05.600]  to engage the video.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:08.300]  So you can obviously shoot regular video,
[01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:12.420]  you can shoot HDR, which I think looks good on the phone,
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:14.880]  but you know, a lot of editors that I've talked to
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:18.320]  like this adds complexity in ways that, you know,
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:19.240]  it's only been a year,
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:20.960]  so industry's still dealing with it.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:23.760]  And now you've got cinematic mode,
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:27.240]  which has a depth map sidecar file
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:30.860]  that can come for the ride that only Apple's apps can read.
[01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:32.360]  And one assumes people will figure,
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:33.480]  it's not even an encrypted file,
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:36.680]  people will figure it out over time, but like...
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:39.400]  Or they'll publish it when they feel like
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.180]  we've stabilized the format enough
[01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:43.320]  and we can publish some APIs,
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.160]  because Apple's been pretty,
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.560]  is pretty open about allowing, you know,
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:50.960]  wanting third-party apps to be able to take advantage
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:51.840]  of powerful stuff.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:55.080]  Like the way that the pro camera apps like Halide
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:58.680]  can do things that Apple's built-in camera app can't.
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:02.320]  I don't think that they want to be the only editing software
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:03.400]  for cinematic mode.
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:06.320]  I just feel like maybe it's not something
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:09.880]  they feel is stable enough to publish or encourage.
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:12.800]  Oh yeah, I wouldn't assign intent to that, like whatever.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:13.960]  Like it's new.
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:16.760]  We asked them, they're like, we don't, it's new, right?
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:18.340]  Like that was basically their vibe.
[01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:20.800]  It wasn't, we're locking this down to make you buy,
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:23.720]  like whatever, but I can issue those criticisms
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:24.640]  about other thing Apple does.
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:25.960]  I would not issue it here.
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:27.120]  But what I'm saying is,
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:32.040]  if you're not just shooting and watching on the phone
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:35.420]  and you're trying to get it to go somewhere else,
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:37.540]  there's actually a surprising amount of complexity
[01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:39.920]  with the phone camera now, right?
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:43.060]  So if you shoot in HDR and you want to upload to Instagram,
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:47.360]  you kind of don't know what's going to happen, right?
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.680]  Or if you shoot cinematic mode and you want to edit it
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:52.520]  and then send it to TikTok, like I think a lot of people
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:55.660]  are like, oh, TikTokers are going to love cinematic mode.
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:59.320]  But you realize like TikTok is a video editor,
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.440]  so it doesn't support cinematic mode.
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.800]  So now you got to edit somewhere else and send it.
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:05.200]  And like all of that complexity is like,
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.840]  once you like think about it, it is surprising.
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:10.240]  What did I do?
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:13.720]  I shot a simple little dumb video,
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:15.760]  it wasn't supposed to be particularly polished,
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:18.060]  but like a single take showing the line of people
[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:21.880]  outside the Apple store on iPhone day last month.
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:25.200]  And I shot it in cinematic mode, because why not?
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.200]  I could kill two birds with one stone
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:29.400]  and illustrate this big long line
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.280]  and show how people waiting in line for an iPhone
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:35.040]  is still a thing, but also give cinematic mode a test.
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:40.040]  And when I went to upload it to Vimeo,
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:42.400]  the cinematic mode was gone.
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:43.240]  And I was like, what?
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:44.500]  This is crazy, I thought it was there.
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:45.840]  And I was like, oh, I get it.
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:48.880]  They don't speak cinematic mode.
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:49.720]  And then I-
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:51.820]  Yeah, you got to bake it and export it from the phone.
[01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:56.240]  Yeah, and I just thought, oh, that occurred to me,
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.240]  that's not going to occur to normal people.
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:01.120]  Yeah, like when your brain is like,
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.280]  oh, there must be a sidecar file.
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:04.000]  Normal people are like, what's a file, right?
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.280]  Like, as we just said, right?
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:09.720]  But it's like, it's kind of stunning.
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:11.280]  Here's this very powerful tool
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:12.240]  that's getting more powerful,
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:14.680]  and interesting in novel ways.
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:18.400]  But it all comes back to files and folders
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:20.200]  and wanting to abstract that stuff
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:22.040]  to get the true power out of it.
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:24.840]  Whereas, there's other pieces of it that are great.
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:26.440]  Like it can shoot ProRes now,
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:29.360]  I think that's in one of the beta updates.
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:31.540]  And you can fill a one terabyte iPhone
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:34.520]  in like five minutes shooting ProRes video on it.
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:35.360]  All right, hold that thought.
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:36.200]  That's awesome.
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:37.560]  I don't know who's going to use it, but that's awesome.
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:39.200]  Let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor.
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:40.560]  It's our good friends at Memberful.
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:43.200]  Memberful is the easiest way to sell memberships
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:44.540]  to your audience.
[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:46.440]  And it is used by some of the biggest
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:48.620]  and most popular creators on the web.
[01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:51.600]  Maybe you already have an existing membership system,
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:53.380]  but it's getting too complicated to manage.
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:55.560]  Every time you want to change something or simplify it,
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.880]  it's a lot of work, feels like you're going to break it.
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:59.520]  You would just want to get back to focusing
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:00.560]  on what you're best at,
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:04.040]  actually, whether it's writing or making videos
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:06.040]  or whatever it is that you're creative at.
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.400]  You just want to focus on your work,
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.120]  not your membership system.
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:13.720]  Memberful handles the hard stuff in flexible ways
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:16.040]  so you can focus on what you do best
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:18.460]  while earning revenue quickly.
[01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:20.440]  They have everything you need to run a membership program,
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:23.280]  including an optimized checkout, Apple Pay support,
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:27.120]  easy membership management, dashboard analytics,
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:30.320]  free gifts, gift subscriptions, and more.
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:32.320]  And they seamlessly integrate with the tools
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.800]  you already use, like WordPress,
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:37.040]  and lots of other systems, too.
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:40.800]  They also have a world-class support team
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:43.080]  who's ready to help you simplify your memberships
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:44.380]  and grow your revenue.
[01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:45.600]  It's win-win.
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:49.320]  They grow their revenue as your revenue grows,
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:53.680]  and your revenue only grows when you make your followers,
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:57.300]  your readers, your listeners, your viewers happy, right?
[01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:01.460]  You make good content, your audience is happy for it,
[01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:05.400]  you make money, and Memberful makes money through you.
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:08.320]  Get started for free with no credit card required.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.400]  You can just check it out.
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:13.120]  Go to memberful.com slash talk show.
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:17.600]  That's memberful.com slash talk show.
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.160]  All right, I wanted to return to something
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:23.240]  you brought up a bit ago, and that's the Lightning port.
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:24.880]  Yeah, future.
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:28.320]  It's like Groundhog Day for writing about iPhones, right?
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:32.060]  Because it kind of feels like we've been arguing about this.
[01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:34.080]  We collectively, people who write about it,
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:35.680]  people who have an audience,
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:38.320]  people who have strong feelings one way or the other,
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:41.400]  every year for a large number of years,
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:46.400]  and it doesn't, eventually it will come to an end.
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:50.140]  There will eventually be an iPhone without a Lightning port.
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:53.160]  I don't know what it will have instead.
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.760]  I don't know if it's coming next year.
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:56.920]  I don't know if it's coming five years,
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:59.160]  but 10 years from now, they are not gonna be
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:02.300]  selling iPhones with this Lightning port.
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:03.320]  I'm confident.
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:04.680]  I'm confident 10 years.
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:05.940]  I feel good about that.
[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:10.940]  But the number one most compelling argument
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:14.040]  against the Lightning port, to me,
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:18.800]  is the two big ones are convenience.
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:21.720]  Hey, if they just added USB-C specifically,
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:23.800]  then I could just charge my iPhone
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:27.720]  with the same thing I charged these other things with,
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:29.360]  which is less compelling to me.
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:31.360]  I get it, and it is true,
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:35.540]  and that is sort of the European Commission's argument
[01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:37.040]  trying to mandate this.
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:40.440]  But to me, the more compelling one is the,
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:43.420]  hey, why are you letting me shoot ProRes video
[01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:45.760]  and RAW photos and these things
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:47.800]  that take up massive amounts of space,
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:51.940]  and you're leaving me with no high-speed option
[01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:54.160]  to get them off the device?
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:55.000]  Yeah, and it's funny,
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.560]  because the USB-C to Lightning exists,
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:59.760]  but it's still pretty slow.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:02.240]  I think it's still like USB two or three speeds.
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:06.120]  It's utterly confusing to me.
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:08.160]  I would add a third one to the mix,
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.600]  and I know Lightning's been around for a long time,
[01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:13.480]  and people are used to it.
[01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:18.200]  But Apple's own Lightning cables are notoriously shitty,
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:19.120]  and don't last a long time.
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:20.600]  They're terrible.
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:23.000]  One of the worst products, in my opinion,
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.400]  that the company has ever made.
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.040]  It is utterly bizarre to me,
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:28.440]  but there's this thriving market.
[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:30.240]  But that's the real one to me,
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:33.060]  is it's been a long time with Lightning,
[01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:34.840]  and it appears that making a Lightning cable
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:36.080]  is very difficult,
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:38.680]  like adorable, long-lasting Lightning cables, right?
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:41.880]  Yeah, so I think my gut feeling,
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:43.160]  I don't want to spend a long time on this,
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:44.760]  because I guess we'll all find out eventually.
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:49.760]  I just don't think, to me, the answer is not USB-C.
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:53.360]  To me, the answer is something
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:55.720]  that's so much better than Lightning,
[01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:58.040]  that it is much better than Lightning
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:02.680]  than Lightning was over the 30-pin adapter from the iPods.
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:04.720]  Yeah, you know, the thing I'll say about USB-C
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:08.520]  is USB-C is Apple's baby.
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:11.240]  They are the ones who wanted this standard to exist.
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:13.960]  They are the ones who pushed it at the USB-C forum.
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:18.520]  They are the ones who more or less created it
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:20.940]  for that MacBook, that 12-inch MacBook.
[01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:24.540]  This is what they wanted, so we have it.
[01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:25.880]  It is a disaster.
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:29.800]  I think it would be better if we had less e-waste
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:31.160]  and we standardized on connectors,
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:32.600]  and everyone knows how I feel about standards,
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:33.600]  and I'm looking at this standard,
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:36.500]  I'm like, F, I don't want this one.
[01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:38.120]  It's a mess.
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:42.040]  I've got a 16-inch Intel MacBook Pro in the next room.
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:45.520]  I am desperate for the M1X or the M2
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:46.920]  that's coming out next week.
[01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:52.360]  If I don't use Apple's 100-watt USB-C brick
[01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:54.960]  and I try to use a different 100-watt USB-C brick,
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:57.120]  which is theoretically its standards,
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:59.120]  these are name brand products I'm buying,
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:03.200]  the SMC on my MacBook will kill itself,
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:04.040]  and I have to reset it.
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:06.760]  It will just stop charging after a while.
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:08.120]  This is your standard.
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:10.200]  You made this.
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:12.400]  The whole industry is pushing on the standard.
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.040]  It's utterly fragmented.
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:17.880]  It is impossible for any normal human being to understand.
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:19.480]  Haim Gartenberger, who works at The Verge,
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:22.220]  is a genius when it comes to USB standards,
[01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:26.000]  and he's like, this is hard to understand, right?
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.320]  I employ someone.
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:29.400]  I pay them money to understand USB-C,
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:31.240]  and they're like, I don't, this sucks.
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:35.320]  It's a mess, and that to me is,
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:36.480]  when you say there's something better than lightning,
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:37.600]  yep, there's something better than lightning,
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:41.960]  but at some point, trying to make everything in the world
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:46.120]  happen through a single connector was just a bad idea.
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:47.760]  That's visually indistinguishable,
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:50.760]  and will actually, it's not just that it looks the same.
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:54.680]  It actually, it will let you plug in the wrong cable,
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:57.760]  and it'll be just as securely seated
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.240]  as if it were the right cable,
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.480]  and you just won't get anything.
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:04.720]  Yeah, USB-C and Thunderbolt, the same cable.
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:07.480]  Wildly different capabilities.
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:09.820]  There was a thing months, it was like a year ago,
[01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:13.240]  but with my dithering podcast with Ben Thompson,
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:17.580]  he was traveling, because it was at a part
[01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:20.380]  where Taiwan was open, and they were able to travel,
[01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:23.960]  and I was locked in, and he bought a portable USB microphone,
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:26.600]  and it was a USB-C microphone, and he couldn't get,
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:28.520]  just audio from a microphone,
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:30.920]  couldn't get audio without the right cable,
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:33.640]  and he just, it didn't even occur to him
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:35.400]  that he should definitely keep the cable
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:37.440]  that came in the box with the microphone,
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:39.200]  because that one would be guaranteed to work,
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:41.800]  and he had to run out to a corner store
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:45.120]  and buy two or three different USB-C cables,
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:46.840]  and only one of the ones he bought worked,
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:48.240]  so the fact that he bought three
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:50.640]  was actually a good idea.
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:52.800]  It's kind of crazy.
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:59.480]  It is a bad idea to have many different things.
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:03.960]  I mean, the Wikipedia page for how many different things
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:08.200]  use the same USB-C port is, it's bananas.
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:10.200]  Well, so you've got power-only cables,
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:13.240]  which I'm just guessing that's what Ben was using,
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:15.080]  and so it wasn't transferring the data.
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:16.520]  And then they've just announced,
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:17.920]  I don't know if you've seen these logos.
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:18.760]  They are horrible.
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:21.080]  Oh, yes, I've mocked them mercilessly.
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:22.760]  They're the worst.
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:26.200]  So there's a new version of the standard now for USB 4,
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:28.520]  same cables, and their idea is they'll just run
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:31.760]  up these horrible logos that say whether they support
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:36.080]  240 watts of power or 40 gigabit per second data speeds,
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:38.760]  and it's like, no one's gonna look at these.
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:42.320]  And also, why don't all the cables support it?
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:43.840]  Why don't you just make all the cables support
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:46.480]  the fastest spec and label them,
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:49.500]  as opposed to just allowing this proliferation
[01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:51.680]  of mismatched cables everywhere?
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:53.180]  And what I just keep coming back to is,
[01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:55.060]  every time we talk to a standards body,
[01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:57.680]  you realize it's Congress,
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:00.260]  but with device manufacturers in it.
[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:01.600]  That's just the way it goes.
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:06.400]  It's political, and there's no one pushing it, right,
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:07.480]  the way that Apple can push lightning.
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.140]  So I think Apple likes that they're firmly
[01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:11.760]  in control of lightning, and no one's gonna monkey with it,
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:16.760]  and there's gonna be off-brand, not licensed cables
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:22.200]  on Amazon to charge your phone, but that's fine.
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:23.740]  We're just not in this zone,
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:26.700]  where it's a constant, permanent, confusing disaster.
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:31.700]  That said, Apple has driven a lot of USB-C development,
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:35.380]  and for them to be like, it's too much of a mess,
[01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:38.060]  it's kind of funny, because it's their baby.
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:43.560]  But nobody, and that's the thing that the zealots
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:47.920]  who really think Apple is doing the world wrong
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:49.980]  by sticking with lightning on iPhone,
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:52.880]  and think in their mind that it's explained
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:55.960]  by a money grab, which really doesn't make sense.
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:58.120]  Apple does not make that much money
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:01.400]  from the Made for iPhone program.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:05.200]  That is really like couch change from Apple's perspective.
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:07.160]  And then I bring that up on Twitter,
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:08.380]  and they'll be like, yeah, but what about
[01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:10.640]  their $30 lightning cables?
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:13.240]  And it's like, well, they sell $30 USB-C cables too,
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:17.840]  and anybody who's gonna buy Apple's lightning cable,
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.460]  which, if you know anything,
[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:23.240]  are not even good lightning cables, they're not durable,
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:25.600]  there's nothing special about them,
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:28.600]  is also gonna buy Apple's USB-C cables,
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:31.520]  which will be just as profitable.
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:33.560]  And again, they don't really make that much money
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.660]  selling cables to people by Apple standards.
[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:37.400]  It's not about the money.
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:38.840]  It might be about control.
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:41.200]  It certainly is, to some degree, about control,
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:46.480]  which you can argue with, as that Apple places
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:49.800]  too much of a priority on wanting to control
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:52.980]  something that could be using an open standard.
[01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:56.040]  But on the other hand, you can't look at Apple's
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:57.640]  other products other than the iPhone,
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:26:59.120]  and just look at the MacBooks.
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:02.680]  They literally shipped a MacBook at one port, or two.
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:07.080]  It had a headphone jack and a USB-C port.
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.480]  One USB-C port, that was it.
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:12.600]  Yeah, I mean, at that point, I loved that computer.
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:13.960]  I know that everybody does.
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:16.040]  I think Dieter loves it too.
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:19.880]  That was the best plain computer in history, in my opinion.
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:22.000]  Now I use an iPad Pro, which is slightly better,
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.160]  because you can put the iPad Pro
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.480]  in low data mode really easily,
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:28.560]  but I just look at that whole mess.
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:29.380]  I agree with you.
[01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:32.360]  I would say that control is probably
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:34.600]  more accurate than profits.
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:39.360]  Apple's hardware ecosystems are shockingly undeveloped
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:41.800]  for the connectors they use.
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:45.840]  So the Lightning ecosystem has never been like,
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:47.580]  there's not just a huge wealth of cool shit
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:48.880]  you can plug into your phone.
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:49.720]  Just never been there.
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:53.120]  Yeah, it really isn't, and it was way more common
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:56.000]  in the early years, and maybe even before Lightning.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.800]  It was like, there were more crazy crap you could plug in
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:01.280]  with the iPhone 4.
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:05.320]  Everybody could see this was a huge explosive market,
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:08.480]  and so it's like, well, let's make weird extra cameras
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:11.680]  that you stick in the iPod port.
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:13.760]  Right, but even if you come to now,
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:16.820]  the way that you end up plugging in a DJ controller
[01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:20.320]  or something into an iOS device for the Lightning port
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:23.000]  is you get the, people were buying the camera connection kit,
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.680]  remember, with the USB port?
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:28.040]  So even Lightning was always intermediated
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:29.920]  through that USB connector.
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:32.880]  So that's one, and then you think about the fact
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:36.940]  iPads have a magnetic keyboard connector on the back,
[01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:38.080]  and it's open.
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:40.000]  We've asked Apple a million times,
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.120]  could anyone use this connector?
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:43.040]  And they've said, yes.
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:44.720]  No one uses that connector.
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:45.560]  Nope, except Logitech.
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:49.560]  And Logitech works hand-in-hand with Apple.
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:52.580]  It's almost like they're making Apple products
[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:54.300]  and putting the Logitech name on them
[01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:56.280]  for the keyboards that Apple doesn't want to make.
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:58.160]  For the cheap keyboards for schools, right?
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:28:59.240]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:01.320]  But that one is utterly mystifying to me.
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:03.240]  Here's a product that everybody wants.
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:05.880]  We know there's demand.
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:07.600]  You literally walk out in the world
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:09.280]  and see the demand in front of you,
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:10.360]  and no one uses that connector.
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:11.280]  They always put you there.
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:12.920]  We've never been able to figure that out.
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:14.440]  Then there's MagSafe on the phone,
[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:19.440]  and MagSafe to me is like, it's a year later.
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:22.400]  I should be able to buy a good car charger,
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:25.000]  MFI car charger, and you cannot.
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:28.880]  You can buy all kinds of wacky ones on Amazon.
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:29.720]  Right.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.480]  My instinct to trust them is low, I would say.
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:34.880]  I would say.
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:39.880]  But if, and you can buy a magnetic charger
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:42.560]  or a magnetic mount that has a Qi charger in it,
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:45.040]  but you won't get the fastest charging speed.
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.360]  And it's just really weird.
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:48.040]  It's like, this one is just magnets.
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:49.560]  Anyone can make a magnet thing.
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:50.400]  Right.
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:51.400]  But you talk to the Moment people.
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:53.000]  I have a great Moment car charger,
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.360]  and I've actually realized that music from my phone
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:58.160]  sounds better in my car when I plug in the cable
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:01.000]  as opposed to over Bluetooth, so whatever.
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.640]  So you have this great Moment magnet mount,
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:03.480]  and I plug in the thing.
[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:04.880]  It's not the end of the world.
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:07.840]  But the Moment people are like, Apple,
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:10.760]  we want these stronger magnets, and we can't do MFI
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:12.840]  if we make the magnets stronger.
[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:15.560]  And it's like, this is all just nuts.
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:17.200]  People want to connect things to the phone.
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:18.680]  Lots of companies want to make cool things
[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:19.720]  that connect to the phone.
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:21.600]  And kind of everywhere you can,
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:24.080]  you see that Apple's insistence on control
[01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:26.920]  is preventing it in some way or the other,
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:30.160]  whether it's Lightning or USB-C or the keyboard connector.
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:33.300]  MagSafe to me is, it's really cool.
[01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:37.600]  This is a really cool idea, and it somehow hasn't,
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:39.480]  the market has not been able to generate
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:41.000]  the first cool idea.
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:45.000]  Yeah, and I think that that sort of gets
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.560]  to the widespread misconception
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:50.040]  about Apple's priorities, right?
[01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:52.080]  And I'm in complete agreement with you.
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:55.880]  I think Apple internally, culturally, values control
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:31:00.560]  more than eking out every last penny of money
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:01.720]  that they could get, right?
[01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:04.040]  Like if Amazon had this product,
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:07.920]  there'd be 30 gazillion MagSafe things
[01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:10.680]  that they're taking a tiny slice of each one.
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:13.920]  They'd be like, sure, whatever you want to make, yeah.
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:16.740]  It would be more about getting, saturating the market
[01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:18.840]  with as many things as possible.
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:21.760]  And you could even look at the Alexa ecosystem
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:23.480]  for just software, right?
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:24.480]  It's not even a money grab.
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:27.320]  It's just free integrations with Alexa.
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:30.480]  And it's like, sure, whatever you think you want to make,
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:31.960]  we'll let you integrate it with Alexa.
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:35.260]  And the Siri stuff is way more complicated
[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:39.080]  and under tight control, and there's therefore,
[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:40.600]  almost shockingly, less of it.
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:44.540]  Do you think MagSafe is like this baby step
[01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:45.640]  towards no ports?
[01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:47.560]  I do, I really do.
[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:51.680]  A combination of MagSafe, and then I often,
[01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:54.480]  I just stare at the back of the iPad Pro
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:57.820]  and look at that little, those three little circles.
[01:31:57.820 --> 01:32:02.240]  And I just think about something like that, you know,
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:04.180]  but that could do data too.
[01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:07.720]  And I actually think in the written language
[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:10.320]  of this EC guideline, who knows if it's going to come
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:13.860]  to pass, but that Apple could actually get around it
[01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:15.840]  without, it's not even a loophole,
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:20.840]  because they've said wireless stuff is not affected.
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.880]  And so a device that is purely wireless,
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:27.020]  and by wireless, they mean inductive, right?
[01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:29.080]  So Apple Watch is a perfect example.
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:31.680]  Apple Watch has never had a port.
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:34.240]  And I know that there's the diagnostic port,
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:36.760]  which actually I just read on the Verge, of all places.
[01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:37.600]  Yeah, it's gone.
[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:39.120]  It's gone, that was actually where I learned it,
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:42.440]  so kudos to the Verge for the scoop on that.
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:43.760]  And I was like, ah, I should have looked,
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:45.600]  I should have looked in that little slot.
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:46.800]  Didn't even occur to me.
[01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:49.780]  But you know, don't count that,
[01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:52.600]  because that's not for users anyway.
[01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:54.480]  Apple Watch has never had a port.
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:57.640]  The EC guideline would not, by any interpretation,
[01:32:57.640 --> 01:32:59.760]  mean that future Apple Watches are supposed
[01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:02.120]  to have a USB-C port.
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:04.840]  But I actually think the iPhone could get around
[01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:07.440]  having a USB-C port in full compliance
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:10.900]  by having something like the iPad Smart Connector.
[01:33:10.900 --> 01:33:13.440]  It couldn't be the same, because the iPad Smart Connector
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:15.480]  does not do high-speed data.
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:19.880]  It's effectively just like the level of data
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:22.480]  you would expect from a trackpad, you know?
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:23.320]  I don't know.
[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:26.280]  I don't know what the data throughput is on a trackpad,
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:31.280]  but it's not transfer ProRes video over this cable.
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:35.680]  But something like that, but that just attaches,
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:38.080]  snaps into place magnetically,
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:41.320]  would be way easier to waterproof and dustproof,
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:46.320]  and it doesn't bend, right?
[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:48.960]  And you get that MagSafe advantage,
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:51.720]  where if you're on a train and somebody gets up
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:54.120]  and their ankle pulls the cable, it would just detach
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:56.920]  rather than send your device flying across
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:59.080]  the aisle of the train.
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:01.440]  Something like that is what I would imagine.
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:05.360]  I have absolutely no idea whether Apple's working
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:07.340]  on such a thing as a replacement for Lightning,
[01:34:07.340 --> 01:34:08.680]  but that would be my hope.
[01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:10.640]  Yeah, you know, it's funny.
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:14.720]  If the EU's point is to lower e-waste,
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:19.720]  that loophole exception accomplishes none of that goal.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.300]  It potentially makes it shockingly worse.
[01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:27.300]  So we'll see, I'm not saying regulators around the world
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:32.760]  don't often miss the obvious unforeseen circumstance.
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:34.440]  I guess obvious unforeseen circumstance
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:36.000]  is kind of a paradoxical thing to say,
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.180]  but that's the loophole you'll drive the truck through.
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:42.080]  We'll see.
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:45.840]  Again, I firmly believe the e-waste problem is real.
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:48.840]  I support Apple not putting the charger in the box,
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:51.420]  although I understand why people, the prices stay the same.
[01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:53.240]  Right, fine.
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:56.320]  But I don't need more USB-C bricks in my house.
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:57.720]  I've got plenty.
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:02.720]  What I'm getting at is we should just have a power standard
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:03.600]  for these devices.
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:05.320]  That's really all we want, right?
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:08.140]  Is I've got a whole bunch of things to charge.
[01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:12.000]  Like AirPods Pro, that's what I have,
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.520]  AirPods charged with Lightning.
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:16.480]  There's no real reason for them to.
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:18.220]  They can be USB-C very easily,
[01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:20.960]  but Apple knows that they're mostly attached to iPhones
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:24.280]  and Apple charges iPhone charge over Lightning.
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:25.660]  So you probably have a Lightning connector
[01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:27.280]  and that's why they made that decision.
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:29.960]  And that sort of stuff does self-perpetuate
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:31.440]  the e-waste problem
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:33.680]  because then you're gonna buy something else.
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:37.220]  Your MacBook is gonna have a USB-C brick
[01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:38.520]  and now you've got to carry two things around.
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:41.060]  And that's just silly to me.
[01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:43.140]  And that is where, you know,
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:46.320]  I hear people say like we shouldn't mandate
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:47.600]  these kinds of standards and connectors,
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:49.400]  but we do it all over the place all the time
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:50.600]  in every other industry.
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:53.880]  The plugs in your wall are a mandated standard, right?
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:57.680]  Like we should be able to get to a power standard at least
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:59.200]  without this much histrionics.
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:01.720]  And the industry is, thus far not being able to do it.
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:03.180]  Data standards on other stuff,
[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:04.760]  yeah, that's gotta stay wide open.
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:05.920]  That's where the innovation happens.
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:08.760]  But charging the stuff,
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:09.580]  there's a part of me that says
[01:36:09.580 --> 01:36:11.080]  we just gotta make that simpler for people.
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:12.440]  Yeah, and I kind of feel,
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:15.240]  I feel like we're just waiting for inductive charging
[01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:17.920]  to get to high speeds, right?
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:18.780]  Because like right now,
[01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:21.720]  I think the fastest you can charge anything over MagSafe
[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:24.280]  is 15 watts, maybe it's 12 watts.
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:25.120]  I think-
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:28.160]  And that's, but it's 15 if you engage Apple's chip.
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:30.900]  Yeah, you have to have it just right and you get 15 watts.
[01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:33.600]  But obviously there are a lot of devices
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:35.900]  that need way more than 15 watts, right?
[01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:36.740]  I mean, like you said,
[01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:40.140]  the 16-inch MacBook Pro comes with 100-watt power adapter.
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:45.880]  Inductive charging I think will get there though, right?
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:47.920]  Like that to me seems to be the future.
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:52.560]  It's not something you plug in and can get jammed in there.
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:55.360]  It's something that's more like inductive,
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:57.600]  but we gotta get it to a high speed.
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:59.780]  And that's, because to me,
[01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:03.040]  the universal way to charge stuff now is sort of chi, right?
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:04.760]  Like if I have to charge my AirPods,
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:07.140]  I charge my AirPods by putting them on,
[01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:11.920]  I have a Nomad three-device charger.
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:13.000]  I forget what it's called.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.100]  It's a really nice thing.
[01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:15.760]  It's like 130 bucks,
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:18.960]  but it lets you charge like a phone and your AirPods
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:21.400]  and even another phone if you wanted to at the same time
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:22.300]  on the same pad.
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:26.400]  And then just like a regular Apple MagSafe puck
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:27.520]  sitting around the kitchen,
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:30.200]  I just put the AirPods on it rather than go to lightning.
[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:31.960]  But Apple, obviously,
[01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:34.520]  anything Apple has that just needs to charge,
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:36.640]  they use lightning very consistently.
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:38.000]  It's not just like AirPods,
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.360]  you can argue that, oh,
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:40.600]  you're gonna use them with your iPhone
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:41.740]  so you have lightning anyway.
[01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:44.660]  But like, there's no other explanation
[01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:47.660]  for why the Apple TV remote charges by lightning, right?
[01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:49.960]  Why does your trackpad or, of course,
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:53.240]  everybody's favorite, the mouse that charges on its belly,
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:57.880]  all of the devices that charge,
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:00.440]  you know, the keyboard, the trackpad, the magic mouse,
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:01.660]  they all charge by lightning,
[01:38:01.660 --> 01:38:03.840]  even though you're using them on a Mac
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:05.460]  that doesn't use lightning.
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:09.400]  I honestly think Apple makes a fair
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:12.320]  and well-supported assumption
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:13.580]  that if you have any of that stuff,
[01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:15.160]  you probably have an iPhone.
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:16.840]  Yeah, I do, too.
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:19.240]  And so they can sort of guarantee
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:21.080]  that this charging cable exists
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:22.480]  and you're comfortable with it.
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:26.700]  Whereas if the Apple TV remote used USB-C,
[01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:29.360]  they might have to ship you a brick and a cable
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:31.640]  to charge your, like, they don't know.
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:34.320]  And that, to me, that's like why,
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:36.360]  like if you're, I keep them back,
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:38.360]  if your focus is reducing e-waste,
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:40.200]  then saying we assume you have an iPhone
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:41.640]  with a USB-C connector
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:44.060]  lets them move all that other stuff, too.
[01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:47.620]  But I think an inductive may or may not get there,
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:50.240]  but, you know, there's,
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:53.440]  wired connections are always gonna be faster
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:55.280]  and more reliable and able to ship more power,
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:57.680]  and they're not gonna go away in this,
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:00.220]  in any kind of timeframe that we can see,
[01:39:00.220 --> 01:39:02.960]  because, yep, the, you know,
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:05.780]  however they do the GPU is the next MacBook,
[01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:07.040]  they're still gonna be GPUs.
[01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:09.160]  They're still gonna want a lot of power.
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:10.680]  I just think that the regulators
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:12.280]  really ought to be smarter
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:14.080]  and think about, like,
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:16.960]  regulating that you shouldn't,
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:19.980]  saying no more chargers and cables in the box
[01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:21.960]  is, to me, a good regulation,
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:23.800]  and then you only buy what you need,
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:27.680]  and you can let market forces determine whether,
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:31.880]  like, should you be able to get
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:34.920]  a free charger with your iPhone purchase?
[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:35.880]  I say yes.
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:38.280]  I say if you buy a new iPhone from Apple,
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:40.000]  there should just be a checkbox that says
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.200]  would you like an 18 or a 20-watt power adapter, too,
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:44.560]  and that they should send it to you
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:46.560]  in its own box free of charge.
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:48.720]  Maybe I'm being too idealistic here, though,
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:50.380]  and there's too many people who would say,
[01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:52.360]  well, why would I say no to a free charger,
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:55.300]  and they'd click the box even though they don't need it,
[01:39:55.300 --> 01:39:57.540]  and it would just perpetuate the e-waste,
[01:39:57.540 --> 01:39:58.380]  because they'd feel like,
[01:39:58.380 --> 01:39:59.640]  I'm a sucker if I don't take it.
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:03.160]  Maybe it should be $5, some nominal charge,
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:08.000]  so that it keeps you from blindly checking the box
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.240]  to get the free one, because free is,
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:11.160]  why would you say no?
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:12.000]  I don't know.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.520]  But, like, I actually have a data point here.
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:17.760]  The CEO of Anchor is gonna be on Decoder
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:19.560]  in the next couple weeks, so I asked him
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:22.320]  when they took the charger out of the box
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:23.160]  through your telescope, and he was like,
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:23.980]  of course they do.
[01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:24.820]  People buy a phone, and they immediately
[01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:25.960]  buy a case and a charger.
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:29.740]  So, like, yeah, like, the market,
[01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:32.680]  the consumer market is just conditioned
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:35.840]  to add these two things to every phone purchase.
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:39.400]  So, I just think the idea that you know
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:40.960]  you have the one at home that's gonna work
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:42.620]  with the new one is not,
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:44.640]  people just haven't bought into it.
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:45.480]  Right.
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:50.440]  You should not do blank is a better form
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:54.800]  of regulation than you must do blank in general.
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:56.580]  But my favorite example is, okay,
[01:40:56.580 --> 01:40:59.820]  so the EU overall is sort of ahead of the game
[01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:03.560]  on reducing e-waste and has tighter regulations
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:06.400]  against their culture, but in France, if you buy an iPhone,
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:09.240]  it still comes with the wired earbuds.
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:12.720]  In a separate box, of course, they didn't
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:15.320]  just make a new box for it, because, like,
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:17.840]  15 years ago, France passed a law
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:20.280]  that you have to have a headset, because,
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:23.440]  I forget if it was like a driving safety thing,
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:26.180]  or if it was at the time when people were afraid
[01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:29.200]  about the radiation, you know, the thing,
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:31.300]  that holding a cell phone up to your ear
[01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:33.360]  was leading to brain tumors.
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:36.540]  But France passed a law that said all cell phones
[01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:40.600]  have to have, you know, a headset and included,
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:42.720]  and once you pass a law like that,
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:45.080]  it's a lot easier to pass than to get it off the books,
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:47.160]  so it's still on the books, so in France,
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:49.460]  you buy an iPhone, you get a pair of wired earbuds
[01:41:49.460 --> 01:41:52.180]  that you probably, most people probably don't want,
[01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:53.460]  don't need, won't use.
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:56.300]  I don't know that we should look to the French
[01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:59.120]  as a model of sensible regulation.
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:00.840]  It might be unfair that I brought that.
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:04.680]  But they're on a different element of the spectrum.
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:09.280]  This is like about Apple's, like,
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:12.360]  the ecosystems around its products and control,
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:13.320]  and you brought up the headphone jack,
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:14.880]  so I'm just gonna take it, I'm gonna take the opening.
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:15.700]  All right.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:20.840]  Apple fundamentally destroyed the headphone industry
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:22.600]  when they pulled that jack off the phone,
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:24.720]  and they now have Bluetooth, and I think, you know,
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:27.080]  they do a reasonably good job Bluetooth,
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:29.440]  but they have created a situation where instead
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:31.320]  of giving you wired headphones in the box,
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:33.880]  everybody buys AirPods with their phones,
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:36.400]  and the AirPods work better than everyone else's products
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:40.160]  because they have a proprietary extension to Bluetooth
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:43.360]  with a proprietary controller in the headphones
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:45.240]  and proprietary software on the phone
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:46.640]  that no one else can access.
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:49.220]  I think my AirPods are great.
[01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:50.640]  I'm not complaining about all this,
[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:53.360]  but you can just see the downstream effect
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:57.020]  on the whole industry because they can no longer
[01:42:57.020 --> 01:42:59.620]  competitively attach their products to the iPhone.
[01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:01.720]  They just cannot do it, and so, like,
[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:04.100]  huge headphone companies, like famous ones,
[01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:06.840]  are consolidating, they're doing that horrible thing
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:09.440]  that happens at the end of famous brands' lives
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:11.240]  where they stop making products and they license their brand
[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:14.080]  to some horrible company that makes horrible junk, you know?
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:15.720]  That's happening all over the place,
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:18.520]  and it's literally, it's not that Qualcomm
[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:21.520]  doesn't wanna make you a great headset chip.
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:24.840]  It's they are prevented from connecting to the iPhone,
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:28.480]  and that, that just, like, again, I like my AirPods.
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:31.480]  I wear them all the time, but you can just see it,
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:35.400]  that that level of control absolutely benefited Apple,
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:39.240]  but it also reduced a pretty enormous amount
[01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:40.600]  of competition in the market
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:42.720]  because you can no longer connect to the most popular thing
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:43.800]  that you wanna listen to music on,
[01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:45.840]  and there's things that I would like
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:48.480]  from my music experience on the iPhone
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:50.200]  that you, like, kinda can't get, right?
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:54.800]  Like, they just roll out lossless music on Apple Music.
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:56.800]  Boy, your AirPods can't get them,
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:58.520]  and no one else can build that product.
[01:43:58.520 --> 01:43:59.360]  That sucks.
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:02.560]  Including your AirPods Max, which is the one that,
[01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:04.260]  that's the one that's a little crazy
[01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:07.000]  because they're $450 headphones, right?
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.560]  I mean, I think that's what they cost.
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:10.000]  Right, but if Sony wanted to show up
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.560]  and say, look, we're really good at this,
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:14.540]  and we've been making wackadoo high-res audio products
[01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:16.080]  for two decades,
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:17.580]  because they, you can still buy, like,
[01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:19.360]  a $2,000 Walkman from Sony
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:22.600]  that is just a wackadoo high-res music product,
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:23.480]  and, like, we're really good at this.
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:25.120]  We make headphones that people love.
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:26.560]  We made the headphones that support
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:28.240]  lossless music on the iPhone.
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:30.500]  Like, they cannot make that product,
[01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:32.160]  and that, to me, is, you know,
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:33.920]  as the phone becomes more central,
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:37.400]  as we, the whole lives filter through this thing, yeah.
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:39.960]  Yep, there's a lot of regulators interested in Apple,
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:42.200]  and, like, that is just one very clear point
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:44.760]  where they made a decision that, you know,
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:46.080]  do we need headphone jacks?
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:47.400]  Do French people all get wired?
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:48.540]  I don't know.
[01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:49.680]  But you could just see what happened
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:50.560]  to the rest of the market
[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:52.480]  after they took out the open-ender connect
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:55.080]  and prioritized their own proprietary one.
[01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:56.760]  But, to me, that's progress.
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:58.920]  I completely acknowledge the trade-offs,
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:01.400]  and I think progress almost always
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:04.000]  involves some form of trade-off,
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.920]  and that is the trade-off where,
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:09.480]  when the default headphone connection
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:11.680]  to all phones was the standard
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:13.700]  3.5-millimeter headphone jack,
[01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:15.480]  there were tremendous benefits to the fact
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:17.400]  that it was completely open,
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:19.860]  brain-dead simple, analog, literally,
[01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:24.860]  and, you know, if you had a strong preference
[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:26.620]  for a certain brand of headphones,
[01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:28.540]  it would work, because it was the same plug,
[01:45:28.540 --> 01:45:30.920]  or, conversely, at the other end of the market,
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:32.940]  if you had no preference whatsoever,
[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:34.780]  you could go into any corner bodega
[01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:36.920]  and buy a pair of headphones for $5,
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:40.700]  and they would work, as well as you'd expect, you know?
[01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:43.100]  Yeah, I once bought a corner bodega,
[01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:45.540]  a pair of wired headphones that looked exactly like Apple's,
[01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:48.780]  and I put them in, and I was like, whoa, like.
[01:45:48.780 --> 01:45:51.820]  I love those, I love the way that,
[01:45:51.820 --> 01:45:54.060]  they have everything that looks like Apple stuff, right?
[01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:54.940]  They've got the headphones,
[01:45:54.940 --> 01:45:57.420]  they've got the lightning cables, I love it.
[01:45:57.420 --> 01:45:59.940]  They did not work nearly, so I threw them away,
[01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:01.300]  like, on the next block.
[01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:04.140]  Well, actually, I, but I think that people,
[01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:05.760]  you know, they work as well as you think
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:07.860]  that $5 bodega headphones are gonna work.
[01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:08.700]  All right, let me think.
[01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:11.020]  Yeah, my point is, just to end it, is fine.
[01:46:11.020 --> 01:46:12.060]  Yep, I agree with you, progress,
[01:46:12.060 --> 01:46:14.660]  and progress obviously is integrated and proprietary.
[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:18.180]  The fact that they've, the market cannot innovate
[01:46:18.180 --> 01:46:20.580]  on Apple's platform is the problem, right?
[01:46:20.580 --> 01:46:25.380]  So if you were allowed to ship your own weirdo extension
[01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:28.000]  to Bluetooth and give it to iPhone owners
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.380]  and let them run lossless music,
[01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:32.400]  well then, now we'd be in a fight, and that'd be great,
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:34.820]  but Apple won't let that happen because of the,
[01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:37.120]  as we talked about, their interest and control.
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:41.300]  Well, and the flip side of it is the standards bodies
[01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:44.660]  work about as well as Congress is also why
[01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:48.400]  the open standards almost always lag behind
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:52.020]  the proprietary ones like Apple's W1 chips
[01:46:52.020 --> 01:46:57.020]  or, you know, insert examples, A, B, C, D here.
[01:46:57.040 --> 01:46:57.880]  Yeah.
[01:46:57.880 --> 01:46:58.720]  You know, yeah.
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:01.900]  So if Bluetooth had gotten its act together
[01:47:01.900 --> 01:47:05.340]  and had been as great as it ideally should have been
[01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:08.040]  years ago, then there never would have been a W1 chip.
[01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:11.660]  Like, the door was opened by the fact
[01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:13.480]  that Bluetooth has never been,
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:16.020]  it's like I always say, next year is the year
[01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:18.300]  Bluetooth gets its act together.
[01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:20.100]  Yeah, like, I wanna believe you,
[01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:21.660]  but Apple's now like the biggest, most powerful
[01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:22.620]  computer company in the world,
[01:47:22.620 --> 01:47:24.540]  and like, if they wanted Bluetooth to be good,
[01:47:24.540 --> 01:47:25.540]  it'd be good.
[01:47:25.540 --> 01:47:27.940]  Yeah, well, and it's different, and that's the other thing,
[01:47:27.940 --> 01:47:32.340]  the big historical difference is that Apple in 20,
[01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:36.100]  when did they first come out with AirPods, 2017 or so?
[01:47:36.100 --> 01:47:38.060]  Yeah, it was with the iPhone 7.
[01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:42.540]  Yeah, you know, Apple in 2017 is very different
[01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:44.780]  than Apple in 2007, right?
[01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:46.420]  Where, okay, we've come out with a phone
[01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:49.320]  and the phone uses a wackadoo iPod connector.
[01:47:50.620 --> 01:47:54.300]  They're just, you know, it had less repercussions
[01:47:54.300 --> 01:47:56.420]  industry-wide because Apple was smaller.
[01:47:57.260 --> 01:47:58.500]  Yeah, do you remember the connectors
[01:47:58.500 --> 01:47:59.900]  on the old Nokia smartphones?
[01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:00.740]  I mean, they were even worse.
[01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:02.220]  Yes, y'all, they were crazy.
[01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:04.300]  I mean, they were, and it was like,
[01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:07.100]  you and your spouse could both buy Nokia phones
[01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:09.820]  and it would, you both have Nokia phones,
[01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:11.500]  you can't charge each other's phones.
[01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:12.540]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:14.740]  All right, let me thank our third and final sponsor,

[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:07.860]  You need a store, they have a store.
[01:49:07.860 --> 01:49:09.460]  Blog, you wanna host a podcast,
[01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:11.140]  they have that stuff built in.

[01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:14.820]  How do you enter new podcast episodes?
[01:49:14.820 --> 01:49:17.080]  They have the CMS, you do all of that,
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:19.140]  you make posts, you edit posts
[01:49:19.140 --> 01:49:21.340]  right through Squarespace itself.

[01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:39.660]  So my thanks to Squarespace, squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:41.700]  Let's talk next week.
[01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:43.500]  I think this is fun, right?
[01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:48.300]  I'm, I just said to somebody, actually it was at CNBC.
[01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:51.220]  I know, are you still doing hits on CNBC?
[01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:53.420]  Yeah, I'll be on after the event, actually.
[01:49:56.020 --> 01:49:57.140]  Lots of fun for me.
[01:49:57.140 --> 01:50:00.900]  I'm trying to get, I tend to say no to things like that,
[01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:02.540]  and I've been trying to say yes
[01:50:02.540 --> 01:50:04.740]  every time they asked me recently,
[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:06.900]  because I know that it's gonna change
[01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:09.980]  when I go back to being in California for these events,
[01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:11.760]  because I'm not gonna wake up
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:13.500]  at five in the morning Pacific time
[01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:18.300]  to go on CNBC before an event.
[01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:21.860]  And while I'm watching these events remotely
[01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:24.820]  on East Coast time, it works out perfectly.
[01:50:24.820 --> 01:50:26.400]  But I was just talking to them about it,
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:28.700]  and they were asking me,
[01:50:28.700 --> 01:50:30.260]  what do I think about next week's event?
[01:50:30.260 --> 01:50:32.780]  And does it warrant a lot of excitement?
[01:50:32.780 --> 01:50:36.980]  And I was like, I think people are more excited this year
[01:50:36.980 --> 01:50:41.460]  than last year, because last year, nobody really,
[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:46.460]  I think even people who were bullish on Apple's chip prowess
[01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:51.420]  still couldn't bring themselves to think about
[01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:54.940]  how badly they were going to pants Intel and AMD
[01:50:54.940 --> 01:50:59.020]  and the rest of the industry on performance per watt.
[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:02.020]  But yet, they've only shown
[01:51:02.020 --> 01:51:05.380]  their consumer Mac chips to date.
[01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:08.040]  So this is the year, clearly the ones that are coming
[01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:09.020]  are the Pro chips.
[01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:11.180]  They've never shown what they can do,
[01:51:11.180 --> 01:51:14.420]  and their consumer chips are, in many ways,
[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:19.300]  faster than the Pro chips on the Intel side of things.
[01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:20.140]  So who knows?
[01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:22.860]  I'm super excited to see what they have.
[01:51:22.860 --> 01:51:28.980]  Yeah, again, I have a 16-inch Intel MacBook Pro.
[01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:30.660]  In the context of when it was released,
[01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:33.620]  it was exactly what everyone wanted, right?
[01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:36.480]  They brought that computer back to where it needed to be.
[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:39.460]  But man, this thing, it is hot.
[01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:40.660]  The fan runs a lot.
[01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:43.540]  It needs an enormous amount of power.
[01:51:43.540 --> 01:51:45.420]  If they can solve the problems
[01:51:45.420 --> 01:51:48.380]  the way they solved the problems with the M1 and the Air
[01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:49.860]  and the littler MacBook Pro,
[01:51:49.860 --> 01:51:53.540]  I mean, there just will not be another high-end laptop
[01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:56.260]  that can compete, in my opinion.
[01:51:56.260 --> 01:51:58.900]  I'm very curious to see,
[01:51:58.900 --> 01:52:00.780]  are they going to stick with the touch bar?
[01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:02.060]  There's rumors they're going to add ports.
[01:52:02.060 --> 01:52:03.500]  I've tried this whole conversation about ports.
[01:52:03.500 --> 01:52:05.420]  There's rumors they're going to add the SD card slot
[01:52:05.420 --> 01:52:09.460]  and the HDMI port back, which I would be thrilled about.
[01:52:09.460 --> 01:52:11.500]  But they've got some big decisions to make
[01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:15.260]  about Mac laptop design ideas along with the chip,
[01:52:15.260 --> 01:52:16.700]  and I'm kind of as interested in those
[01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:21.060]  as I am just raw performance, less heat,
[01:52:21.060 --> 01:52:22.760]  my fan not blowing all the time.
[01:52:24.260 --> 01:52:27.420]  They're at a decision point, I think,
[01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:29.300]  with the Pro laptops.
[01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:33.320]  I also think that, and again, I often say,
[01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:36.460]  I don't want to just blame everything on Johnny Ive
[01:52:36.460 --> 01:52:38.020]  just because now he's not at the company,
[01:52:38.020 --> 01:52:43.020]  but you don't have to be an insider
[01:52:43.020 --> 01:52:47.020]  with inside sources at Apple to see how,
[01:52:47.020 --> 01:52:52.020]  after Steve Jobs died, in the subsequent years,
[01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:56.420]  their products across the board seem to take on
[01:52:57.620 --> 01:53:00.420]  Johnny Ive-like sensibilities, you know?
[01:53:00.420 --> 01:53:05.420]  That however, you know, like you can tell
[01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:10.620]  by listening to Paul McCartney and John Lennon's solo work
[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:13.020]  post-Beatles breakup, you can go back and look
[01:53:13.020 --> 01:53:16.020]  at the Beatles work and see how they influenced each other
[01:53:16.020 --> 01:53:19.020]  and tempered each other and helped each other, right?
[01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:24.020]  And, you know, things took on a Johnny Ive flair
[01:53:24.220 --> 01:53:27.820]  in that decade, and it seems like now that Johnny Ive
[01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:32.820]  has left, there's a sort of return to balance
[01:53:33.220 --> 01:53:37.620]  between power and consumer elegance, right?
[01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:39.820]  And one of the ways that I think about it
[01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:42.020]  and one of the ways that I would say that is,
[01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:47.020]  to my eyes, in like the last, you know,
[01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:52.020]  maybe like 2014 onward, there's just not that much
[01:53:52.020 --> 01:53:55.320]  distinction between Apple's Pro laptops
[01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:56.980]  and their consumer laptops, right?
[01:53:56.980 --> 01:54:01.260]  It's like, sure, the Air has a teardrop form factor,
[01:54:01.260 --> 01:54:04.520]  but it really isn't that much different
[01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:06.740]  than the 13-inch MacBook Pro.
[01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:08.580]  Sure, it's tear-shaped instead of not,
[01:54:08.580 --> 01:54:10.820]  but for the most part, they're just sort of,
[01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:14.100]  like the Pro seems unnecessarily thin.
[01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:18.620]  And I would even say that with the 16-inch MacBook Pro,
[01:54:18.620 --> 01:54:20.780]  which is their only 16-inch laptop,
[01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:24.060]  it didn't need to be so thin.
[01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:25.660]  It didn't need to get rid of ports
[01:54:25.660 --> 01:54:26.940]  that it didn't have to get.
[01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:30.540]  Why are you doing a port reduction on this beast
[01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:34.820]  of a laptop that people are buying, right?
[01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:36.980]  People's SD card slot to me has always been,
[01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:40.740]  like, you know every one of the customers
[01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:43.180]  for this product has SD cards in their life.
[01:54:43.180 --> 01:54:45.380]  You know it, it's obvious.
[01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:47.420]  And even if they don't, they don't care.
[01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:50.100]  Nobody, honestly, even somebody who's really,
[01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:53.540]  really picky about details and wanting things
[01:54:53.540 --> 01:54:56.820]  to be just right, that nobody's looking at that SD slot
[01:54:56.820 --> 01:54:59.380]  on their previous 15-inch MacBook Pro
[01:54:59.380 --> 01:55:02.180]  or the 13-inch MacBook Pro and thinking,
[01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:04.860]  I never used this, this is disfigured,
[01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:06.980]  the side of my laptop.
[01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:09.980]  Yeah, you know, you said elegance.
[01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:10.900]  I've been thinking about this a lot
[01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:14.020]  in the context of I and Jobs.
[01:55:14.020 --> 01:55:16.380]  You know, it was the anniversary of Jobs's death.
[01:55:16.380 --> 01:55:18.980]  I've had that nice note in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:55:20.140 --> 01:55:22.900]  I think Apple got confused
[01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:26.380]  that elegance meant making things hidden.
[01:55:26.380 --> 01:55:28.020]  Mm-hmm, oh, I think so, too.
[01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:28.860]  And I think you see,
[01:55:28.860 --> 01:55:30.440]  and I bet you're going in this direction.
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:32.340]  It's still true with software, right?
[01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:36.860]  Yeah, yeah, just keep hiding things from you that you need
[01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:39.820]  and actually making those things understandable
[01:55:39.820 --> 01:55:43.580]  and democratic in the sense that you can use them
[01:55:43.580 --> 01:55:45.900]  is the more elegant solution,
[01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:47.860]  as opposed to guessing on your behalf
[01:55:47.860 --> 01:55:51.860]  or hidden UI patterns that show up when something else,
[01:55:51.860 --> 01:55:54.980]  like, you can just tell people what's going on.
[01:55:54.980 --> 01:55:55.820]  Yeah.
[01:55:55.820 --> 01:55:59.120]  And one of the most elegant products Apple ever made
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:02.180]  was that first sequence of iMacs.
[01:56:02.180 --> 01:56:04.620]  Where they were like, look at the CRT tube.
[01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:06.860]  Just look at it.
[01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:08.660]  We're making it the design element of the computer
[01:56:08.660 --> 01:56:11.180]  or the iMac G4, where they're like, we're moving the thing.
[01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:13.380]  You can see this whole hinge element.
[01:56:13.380 --> 01:56:15.380]  And they were really good at saying,
[01:56:15.380 --> 01:56:17.380]  we're gonna show it to you.
[01:56:17.380 --> 01:56:20.180]  And the elegance is how we're gonna display
[01:56:20.180 --> 01:56:21.560]  how it works to you.
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:22.940]  And so you understand it.
[01:56:22.940 --> 01:56:24.680]  And they've gotten to a point where they're like,
[01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:26.300]  what if we don't show it to you?
[01:56:26.300 --> 01:56:27.660]  What if we hide everything?
[01:56:27.660 --> 01:56:29.980]  And I think that balance is sort of coming back.
[01:56:29.980 --> 01:56:32.340]  I'm not saying they're gonna make a beautiful HDMI port,
[01:56:32.340 --> 01:56:34.260]  but that balance is coming back
[01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:35.940]  to practicality and hardware.
[01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:38.900]  I do not know if it is anywhere near there in software.
[01:56:38.900 --> 01:56:40.380]  Software is all over the map right now.
[01:56:40.380 --> 01:56:41.460]  Yeah.
[01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:42.500]  Yeah, let's leave that aside.
[01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:43.660]  That's too big of a discussion.
[01:56:43.660 --> 01:56:46.740]  But it's, but I do think,
[01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:48.500]  I really do think that if you look
[01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:50.180]  at the 16-inch MacBook Pro
[01:56:50.180 --> 01:56:52.500]  or the current 13-inch MacBook Pro,
[01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:55.540]  they're just, even before you turn it on,
[01:56:55.540 --> 01:56:57.040]  not running benchmarks,
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:01.220]  they're not pro enough just looking at them
[01:57:01.220 --> 01:57:05.460]  compared to what you know are consumer-level MacBooks,
[01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:10.460]  like the MacBook Air or the M1 13-inch MacBook Pro
[01:57:11.740 --> 01:57:14.060]  that only has two ports and is sort of,
[01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:15.460]  they call it a 13, you know.
[01:57:16.820 --> 01:57:18.980]  It's not a pro MacBook Pro.
[01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:25.140]  The pro ones just aren't, there's just some obvious things.
[01:57:25.140 --> 01:57:28.860]  And I'm not pro in favor of, like,
[01:57:28.860 --> 01:57:31.380]  adding 40 different ports to the side.
[01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:34.100]  I just think, though, that the number of ports
[01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:37.460]  Apple used to put on MacBook Pros
[01:57:37.460 --> 01:57:42.420]  circa 2013, 14, and earlier
[01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:45.540]  was the right level, right?
[01:57:45.540 --> 01:57:48.220]  And they've always been aggressive.
[01:57:48.220 --> 01:57:50.260]  Even, you know, whatever era you want to say
[01:57:50.260 --> 01:57:52.820]  was your peak Macintosh for you.
[01:57:52.820 --> 01:57:53.820]  You know, I know a lot of people
[01:57:53.820 --> 01:57:56.220]  still talk about Mac OS 10.6,
[01:57:56.220 --> 01:57:57.980]  which I think was, like, 2006.
[01:57:57.980 --> 01:58:01.420]  That was the year they claimed no new features
[01:58:01.420 --> 01:58:03.100]  and were just gonna clean it up and-
[01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:04.060]  Oh, that's mine.
[01:58:04.060 --> 01:58:05.020]  People love it.
[01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:06.300]  Snow Leopard, yeah, it was great.
[01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:07.820]  And it was a great release.
[01:58:07.820 --> 01:58:09.940]  And it was, you know, and the cheers,
[01:58:09.940 --> 01:58:11.540]  like, I think it was still Bertrand
[01:58:11.540 --> 01:58:14.620]  who announced no new features during the keynote.
[01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:19.340]  And, you know, the cheers in the keynote hall were legit.
[01:58:19.340 --> 01:58:20.860]  It was great.
[01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:23.320]  But they, you know, they still were at a point
[01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:26.300]  where they weren't keeping antiquated old ports around
[01:58:26.300 --> 01:58:28.780]  just because some people still use them.
[01:58:28.780 --> 01:58:30.380]  They were, you know, somewhat aggressive,
[01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:32.740]  but they weren't, you're gonna get two ports,
[01:58:32.740 --> 01:58:35.740]  they're both gonna be USB-C, and that's it.
[01:58:35.740 --> 01:58:37.940]  Yeah, I mean, they were, I mean, right?
[01:58:37.940 --> 01:58:39.820]  That iMac all went to USB,
[01:58:39.820 --> 01:58:42.340]  but the whole industry was, like,
[01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:44.300]  coalescing and Apple pushed them.
[01:58:44.300 --> 01:58:46.820]  I think about just the things I plug into
[01:58:46.820 --> 01:58:48.300]  my MacBook Pro every day.
[01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:52.260]  It's power, it's a USB-C capture card
[01:58:52.260 --> 01:58:56.020]  for my nicer webcam, my RX100 that I use as a webcam.
[01:58:56.020 --> 01:58:57.820]  And it's a little dock that has HDMI out
[01:58:57.820 --> 01:59:00.480]  to run an external monitor.
[01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:01.820]  All of that should be one cable, right?
[01:59:01.820 --> 01:59:05.480]  Like, but because USB-C is just, like, messy, it cannot be.
[01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:08.300]  And that is the reality, right?
[01:59:08.300 --> 01:59:12.100]  Like, the reality is, even when I'm, like, this close
[01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:14.900]  to being like, I could just plug everything into one,
[01:59:14.900 --> 01:59:16.940]  the reality is it's sort of better
[01:59:16.940 --> 01:59:18.980]  when you separate them apart, and if one thing fails,
[01:59:18.980 --> 01:59:19.900]  everything else doesn't go to hell.
[01:59:19.900 --> 01:59:23.420]  I'm like, just make that reality elegant,
[01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:27.500]  as opposed to pushing me towards a thing that you want
[01:59:27.500 --> 01:59:31.300]  that looks better, but is actually far less practical.
[01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:33.460]  And that, to me, like, yep, I want this computer
[01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:35.540]  to have an HDMI port, I can get rid of the stock.
[01:59:35.540 --> 01:59:36.620]  That seems great to me.
[01:59:36.620 --> 01:59:39.620]  Like, it's one less thing on my desk.
[01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:43.700]  I personally don't think I've,
[01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:45.040]  I can't remember the last time I wanted
[01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:48.400]  to plug an HDMI cable into my Mac.
[01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:51.160]  It's been a long time.
[01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:56.160]  But I, what I need, what defines my needs,
[01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:59.640]  I know isn't representative of everybody else.
[01:59:59.640 --> 02:00:02.720]  And I know that lots and lots of people who work
[02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:07.720]  in actual offices of any kind, schools, office buildings,
[02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:13.860]  need to plug into projectors on a weekly basis,
[02:00:13.860 --> 02:00:18.580]  weekly basis, you know, if, you know, pandemic aside,
[02:00:18.580 --> 02:00:21.060]  you know, that you need, somebody needs to plug in
[02:00:21.060 --> 02:00:24.140]  to this thing, and if you always need dongles,
[02:00:24.140 --> 02:00:26.420]  it's a pain, and I'm not saying,
[02:00:26.420 --> 02:00:28.980]  and I used to make fun of, like, there were so many,
[02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:32.500]  I remember there were Sony, really elegant Sony laptops
[02:00:32.500 --> 02:00:37.500]  that really clearly, how they fit a VGA port on them
[02:00:38.500 --> 02:00:41.460]  was, like, it was like a weird,
[02:00:41.460 --> 02:00:43.860]  it almost looked like a meme from Reddit
[02:00:43.860 --> 02:00:46.220]  that somebody Photoshopped, because it looked like
[02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:49.820]  the VGA port was actually thicker than the laptop.
[02:00:49.820 --> 02:00:53.640]  I get it, you know, the PCs stuck with VGA for a long time,
[02:00:53.640 --> 02:00:56.680]  and it was, you know, because there were VGA projectors
[02:00:56.680 --> 02:00:58.720]  all over the place, and that's why they felt
[02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:00.220]  like it was needed.
[02:01:00.220 --> 02:01:02.460]  There's a better middle ground, I don't know.
[02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:05.860]  It's, you know, I would say, I'll just give this advice.
[02:01:05.860 --> 02:01:07.660]  So I'm assuming you don't live your life on Zoom.
[02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:09.860]  I live my life in a series of Zoom meetings.
[02:01:09.860 --> 02:01:11.900]  Try to stay off it as much as I can.
[02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:15.260]  Right, so I run this, like, 80-person newsroom
[02:01:15.260 --> 02:01:17.900]  at a 1600-person company, my life is Zoom meetings.
[02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:22.880]  The reason I use an, I wasn't using one all the time before,
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:27.340]  but I have a 48-inch TV or something,
[02:01:27.340 --> 02:01:29.100]  and then my camera is mounted on an arm
[02:01:29.100 --> 02:01:30.900]  in the middle of that TV.
[02:01:30.900 --> 02:01:34.940]  So I can sit six feet back from Zoom,
[02:01:34.940 --> 02:01:37.220]  and it is just, like, my whole relationship
[02:01:37.220 --> 02:01:39.940]  to this product has changed because of that.
[02:01:39.940 --> 02:01:42.380]  But that's, like, that's reality.
[02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:43.940]  Like, if we're all gonna work from home,
[02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:45.320]  like, I'm gonna live my life on Zoom.
[02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:48.540]  Like, in order to make that better,
[02:01:48.540 --> 02:01:50.780]  I need these cables to be plugged into my computer
[02:01:50.780 --> 02:01:52.060]  all the time, and if I wanna go away
[02:01:52.060 --> 02:01:53.020]  and, like, type somewhere else,
[02:01:53.020 --> 02:01:54.760]  I gotta unplug all the cables.
[02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:57.460]  That, just understanding that that is reality
[02:01:57.460 --> 02:01:59.580]  for a lot of people now, I know a lot of people
[02:01:59.580 --> 02:02:01.340]  with setups like this.
[02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:03.820]  I know a lot of people with fancy webcams.
[02:02:03.820 --> 02:02:07.580]  Well, we gotta, you have to make the reality,
[02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:08.940]  like, surprise and delight, right?
[02:02:08.940 --> 02:02:12.380]  You have to make that reality delightful.
[02:02:12.380 --> 02:02:14.700]  And I think Apple's shifting in there.
[02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:16.000]  I think, you know, some of the stuff they're doing
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:17.420]  on the iPad with the center stage
[02:02:17.420 --> 02:02:18.900]  and moving the cameras around.
[02:02:18.900 --> 02:02:21.460]  Like, they're bending to the reality,
[02:02:21.460 --> 02:02:24.140]  but for the pro machines in particular,
[02:02:24.140 --> 02:02:26.260]  fighting against the reality of how people
[02:02:26.260 --> 02:02:29.220]  are doing their jobs has been a mess for them.
[02:02:29.220 --> 02:02:31.620]  So, like I said, the performance of the chips,
[02:02:31.620 --> 02:02:32.780]  super excited about it.
[02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:34.700]  I think that's gonna be, it's just fascinating
[02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:38.540]  to see what they do, how they solve the GPU problem.
[02:02:38.540 --> 02:02:39.380]  Yep.
[02:02:39.380 --> 02:02:41.420]  You're not expecting to use AMD GPUs in these laptops.
[02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:44.820]  No, I think they're going with their own custom GPUs,
[02:02:44.820 --> 02:02:48.060]  and I think that they've held that whole story
[02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:49.380]  close to their vest.
[02:02:49.380 --> 02:02:51.580]  They haven't shown a word of it,
[02:02:51.580 --> 02:02:53.900]  and I think it's exactly the way that people,
[02:02:53.900 --> 02:02:55.660]  they're just, we're naturally skeptical
[02:02:55.660 --> 02:02:58.500]  that their CPUs would really be that competitive
[02:02:58.500 --> 02:03:00.540]  with Intel's, oh my god, they're better?
[02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:01.360]  Last year?
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:03.740]  I think it's gonna be the same story with the GPUs.
[02:03:03.740 --> 02:03:06.260]  Yeah, I'm ridiculously excited about that.
[02:03:06.260 --> 02:03:08.420]  Honestly, I'm just excited to open Chrome
[02:03:08.420 --> 02:03:09.620]  and not have the fan turn on.
[02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:11.660]  This would be great for me.
[02:03:11.660 --> 02:03:13.580]  But that's all really interesting.
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:15.300]  But the other piece, are you gonna still
[02:03:15.300 --> 02:03:17.380]  force a bunch of pros to use the touch bar?
[02:03:17.380 --> 02:03:20.140]  It's, right, I don't know.
[02:03:20.140 --> 02:03:21.960]  Here's what I think, before we get to touch bar.
[02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:25.020]  I think that the most interesting thing to me
[02:03:25.020 --> 02:03:29.980]  would be if, and as a sign of their commitment to,
[02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:32.740]  like, in almost every area of life,
[02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:34.260]  I think the most interesting products
[02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:35.740]  are at the extremes, right?
[02:03:35.740 --> 02:03:39.220]  So like, to me, the most interesting small laptop
[02:03:39.220 --> 02:03:42.280]  Apple has made ever is the 12-inch MacBook
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:43.820]  that only had one port, right?
[02:03:43.820 --> 02:03:44.720]  I didn't buy one.
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:46.140]  I was very close.
[02:03:46.140 --> 02:03:47.540]  I really, if I traveled more,
[02:03:47.540 --> 02:03:48.760]  I would have had one for sure.
[02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:50.400]  Super interesting product.
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:53.220]  I really hope that now that they're back on Apple Silicon,
[02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:57.760]  they can make something like that or even smaller again.
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:00.260]  Super interesting, even though it was super limited.
[02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:02.700]  And then to me, the most interesting other MacBooks
[02:04:02.700 --> 02:04:05.880]  are the MacBook Pros that are really pro.
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:08.140]  And what do you want with them?
[02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:09.980]  To me, just as a small sign of,
[02:04:09.980 --> 02:04:11.380]  oh, they're serious about this,
[02:04:11.380 --> 02:04:14.260]  would be if next week's Mac 16-inch,
[02:04:14.260 --> 02:04:15.980]  I assume that the rumors are right
[02:04:15.980 --> 02:04:18.660]  that the smaller one will be 14-inch instead of 13-inch,
[02:04:18.660 --> 02:04:20.560]  so I'll call it the 14-inch.
[02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:22.820]  I would say, even if they're thicker,
[02:04:22.820 --> 02:04:25.540]  what if they're thicker than the ones that they're replacing?
[02:04:25.540 --> 02:04:29.540]  Not a lot, not like bricks, not like dictionary thick,
[02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:31.580]  but just thicker, just, hey,
[02:04:31.580 --> 02:04:36.300]  this endless pursuit of thinness, even in the pro laptops.
[02:04:36.300 --> 02:04:38.780]  Because what if, all we've ever seen
[02:04:38.780 --> 02:04:42.700]  from Apple Silicon so far is heat-constrained, right?
[02:04:42.700 --> 02:04:47.020]  And sure, the 13-inch MacBook Pro M1 has a fan,
[02:04:47.020 --> 02:04:48.940]  but it's not like a fan fan.
[02:04:48.940 --> 02:04:52.660]  What if they let Apple Silicon run fairly hot?
[02:04:52.660 --> 02:04:56.060]  You're like, what if when you open Chrome, the fan turned?
[02:04:56.060 --> 02:04:59.500]  Right, well, no, but what if you don't hear it?
[02:04:59.500 --> 02:05:01.140]  What if they make it thicker
[02:05:01.140 --> 02:05:04.560]  and put slightly bigger feet on the bottom?
[02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:07.180]  I know there was a patent, you can't go by patents,
[02:05:07.180 --> 02:05:09.420]  but there was a patent filed about,
[02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:11.580]  hey, what if we had adjustable feet?
[02:05:11.580 --> 02:05:14.380]  And put just a little bit, not something awkward,
[02:05:14.380 --> 02:05:15.340]  something still elegant,
[02:05:15.340 --> 02:05:18.300]  but what if it sat a little higher off the desk?
[02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:20.060]  Because it was gonna actually be assumed
[02:05:20.060 --> 02:05:21.420]  that you're gonna be doing things
[02:05:21.420 --> 02:05:22.700]  that are gonna make the fan turn on.
[02:05:22.700 --> 02:05:24.500]  We're gonna keep it silent.
[02:05:24.500 --> 02:05:28.100]  They did that with the iMac Pro, with the Xeon chips,
[02:05:28.100 --> 02:05:30.480]  and at the press event had us go
[02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:31.780]  and put our ears behind it
[02:05:31.780 --> 02:05:34.560]  while something processor-intensive,
[02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:36.260]  you could see it running on the display,
[02:05:36.260 --> 02:05:38.020]  and then you'd go back and it's like,
[02:05:38.020 --> 02:05:41.660]  huh, I guess I feel the air, but I don't hear anything.
[02:05:41.660 --> 02:05:45.500]  This is kind of an amazing heat dissipation system.
[02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:47.780]  What if they go that way with the pro laptops?
[02:05:47.780 --> 02:05:50.840]  I think even before we benchmark them,
[02:05:50.840 --> 02:05:53.540]  if it turns out that they're slightly thicker,
[02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:56.800]  just a few millimeters, but in terms of showing that,
[02:05:56.800 --> 02:05:58.940]  hey, we're willing to make these laptops thicker
[02:05:58.940 --> 02:06:01.780]  because we're gonna want more air flow
[02:06:01.780 --> 02:06:03.860]  and bigger batteries, would be like,
[02:06:03.860 --> 02:06:06.620]  yeah, they get it, these are pro laptops.
[02:06:06.620 --> 02:06:08.500]  Yeah, I think that would be fascinating.
[02:06:08.500 --> 02:06:10.900]  It would also let you put a bigger battery in there,
[02:06:10.900 --> 02:06:13.660]  which is like, which is a pro feature.
[02:06:13.660 --> 02:06:16.140]  Yeah, like an actual all-day battery life
[02:06:16.140 --> 02:06:17.620]  in a 60-inch laptop.
[02:06:17.620 --> 02:06:20.820]  If you assume that Apple Silicon will get you
[02:06:20.820 --> 02:06:22.360]  the performance per watt,
[02:06:22.360 --> 02:06:25.100]  actually running a 60-inch laptop all day
[02:06:25.100 --> 02:06:28.340]  or a 14-inch pro laptop all day would be incredible.
[02:06:28.340 --> 02:06:29.880]  That product doesn't exist.
[02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:32.500]  I think the real question is how the GPU.
[02:06:32.500 --> 02:06:36.700]  The GPU companies are not struggling like Intel is.
[02:06:36.700 --> 02:06:39.820]  Like Nvidia and AMD are good at making GPUs.
[02:06:39.820 --> 02:06:44.000]  There isn't this plateau of performance
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.900]  that the industry has sort of hit on the CPU side.
[02:06:46.900 --> 02:06:49.300]  I wanna know, like are they gonna,
[02:06:49.300 --> 02:06:51.020]  they've made bad GPU decisions
[02:06:51.020 --> 02:06:52.220]  in their pro products before.
[02:06:52.220 --> 02:06:53.420]  Yes, they have, that's true.
[02:06:53.420 --> 02:06:54.860]  So like they're scarred by this.
[02:06:54.860 --> 02:06:57.380]  I'm very curious to see which way they go.
[02:06:57.380 --> 02:07:00.100]  Well, and I think that if there's an opening,
[02:07:00.100 --> 02:07:01.860]  it's that like the Nvidia,
[02:07:01.860 --> 02:07:04.260]  the performance certainly isn't lacking,
[02:07:04.260 --> 02:07:07.420]  but maybe the performance per watt is, right?
[02:07:07.420 --> 02:07:09.020]  Like the gaming, you know, all these,
[02:07:09.020 --> 02:07:12.060]  the 5,700, whatever the numbers are.
[02:07:12.060 --> 02:07:14.340]  I don't know, my son, you know, is very,
[02:07:14.340 --> 02:07:15.700]  keeps me informed on them.
[02:07:15.700 --> 02:07:19.060]  But they have enormous fans dedicated just to the GPU.
[02:07:19.060 --> 02:07:20.620]  And I know I'm, you know, talking-
[02:07:20.620 --> 02:07:21.740]  And power supplies, straight up.
[02:07:21.740 --> 02:07:24.860]  And power supplies straight up, right on the card.
[02:07:24.860 --> 02:07:29.240]  There's certainly a performance per watt opportunity there.
[02:07:30.860 --> 02:07:33.380]  I think the other interesting thing though about it
[02:07:33.380 --> 02:07:34.780]  is if they go their own way,
[02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:38.700]  which is what I'm very strongly assuming they will,
[02:07:38.700 --> 02:07:40.460]  the software story, right?
[02:07:40.460 --> 02:07:42.060]  Like, cause you're gonna have to pro,
[02:07:42.060 --> 02:07:43.680]  anything that's gonna take advantage of it
[02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:46.100]  is gonna have to use Apple's Metal APIs,
[02:07:46.100 --> 02:07:50.400]  not the APIs that run, the same ones that run on,
[02:07:51.820 --> 02:07:54.060]  and it's not like recompiling an app.
[02:07:54.060 --> 02:07:57.000]  Like, oh, so my app was only native for Intel.
[02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:58.300]  I just went into Xcode,
[02:07:58.300 --> 02:08:00.980]  changed the target to Apple Silicon, recompiled,
[02:08:00.980 --> 02:08:03.060]  and now I have a native Apple Silicon app.
[02:08:03.060 --> 02:08:04.060]  It doesn't work like that
[02:08:04.060 --> 02:08:07.540]  for high-end, GPU-intensive purposes,
[02:08:07.540 --> 02:08:10.900]  whether it's games or professional rendering software,
[02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:12.020]  that sort of thing.
[02:08:12.020 --> 02:08:15.100]  You know, your Metal APIs require you to commit
[02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:16.540]  and write software for it.
[02:08:16.540 --> 02:08:19.060]  That, to me, would be the, hmm,
[02:08:19.060 --> 02:08:22.580]  what if Apple drops this amazing GPU in the forest,
[02:08:22.580 --> 02:08:25.060]  but there's no software to hear it?
[02:08:25.060 --> 02:08:28.660]  This was true when I did the new Mac Pro review,
[02:08:28.660 --> 02:08:32.020]  not the, the old Mac Pro is the thing I was referencing,
[02:08:32.020 --> 02:08:34.840]  the trash can, where they made the GPU bet
[02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:35.680]  that didn't pay off.
[02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:37.380]  But the new Mac Pro, right?
[02:08:37.380 --> 02:08:38.940]  So what everybody wanted, everyone's happy about it,
[02:08:38.940 --> 02:08:42.540]  we reviewed it, I gave it to a bunch of people in our inbox,
[02:08:42.540 --> 02:08:44.500]  I mean, I gave it to the print designers at New York Bag,
[02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:46.100]  I gave it to our video team,
[02:08:46.100 --> 02:08:47.900]  I gave it to the people who make the Netflix show,
[02:08:47.900 --> 02:08:49.400]  the Xplained show, Unboxed.
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:51.600]  And they're like, yeah, this thing is great,
[02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:52.440]  it seems really fast,
[02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:53.960]  none of our software is optimized for this.
[02:08:53.960 --> 02:08:54.800]  Yep.
[02:08:54.800 --> 02:08:57.180]  And it was just like, well, yeah, Adobe,
[02:08:57.180 --> 02:09:00.540]  like, in the end, I'm just reviewing Adobe software roadmap.
[02:09:00.540 --> 02:09:02.300]  That's what it felt like by the end of that review.
[02:09:02.300 --> 02:09:06.480]  Like, is Adobe gonna commit to this GPU architecture?
[02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:09.100]  Are they gonna commit to Metal in this way?
[02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:10.820]  Who knows, right?
[02:09:10.820 --> 02:09:14.740]  Because on the flip side, a lot of big shops are, right,
[02:09:14.740 --> 02:09:18.300]  they're buying GPUs, they're buying NVIDIA GPUs,
[02:09:18.300 --> 02:09:21.240]  they're putting them in PCs, that's where the action is.
[02:09:22.260 --> 02:09:24.020]  And they've made that investment,
[02:09:24.020 --> 02:09:25.920]  and you're not gonna get them to move really fast.
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:26.760]  I hope they do.
[02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:30.060]  Like, there's something about a different kind
[02:09:30.060 --> 02:09:32.660]  of GPU architecture in a different form factor
[02:09:32.660 --> 02:09:34.220]  that might be faster,
[02:09:34.220 --> 02:09:36.980]  that is, like, the old school reasons I was excited
[02:09:36.980 --> 02:09:37.820]  about computing.
[02:09:37.820 --> 02:09:41.060]  Like, RISC versus CISC was a thing I used
[02:09:41.060 --> 02:09:42.400]  to care about a lot, right?
[02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:43.740]  We all did, we all did.
[02:09:43.740 --> 02:09:45.780]  And so, like, I don't know.
[02:09:45.780 --> 02:09:47.780]  I'm, like, excited to have a little bit of that back
[02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:52.640]  in the mix, but, you know, the industry is consolidated,
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:54.880]  so, like, maybe we're gonna see some new kind
[02:09:54.880 --> 02:09:56.860]  of software vendors come up for these new architectures.
[02:09:56.860 --> 02:09:59.700]  I think that's also one of the interesting things
[02:09:59.700 --> 02:10:02.460]  to see in this event, and it seems,
[02:10:02.460 --> 02:10:04.780]  and maybe it's just the type of events they've had
[02:10:04.780 --> 02:10:06.900]  over the last year and a half that there are fewer
[02:10:06.900 --> 02:10:09.620]  special guests from outside the company.
[02:10:09.620 --> 02:10:11.780]  I know sometimes they'll cut to a montage
[02:10:11.780 --> 02:10:13.700]  of, like, game developers or something like that,
[02:10:13.700 --> 02:10:15.860]  but it's, like, it's a little different
[02:10:15.860 --> 02:10:18.220]  than in the on-stage events, when they're, like,
[02:10:18.220 --> 02:10:20.260]  let me introduce so-and-so from Adobe,
[02:10:20.260 --> 02:10:22.060]  and then they come out and they have, like,
[02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:25.040]  a full four minutes to demo something.
[02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:27.220]  I don't feel sad about that.
[02:10:27.220 --> 02:10:29.100]  I feel like those demos always were, like,
[02:10:29.100 --> 02:10:32.700]  you could see, like, the pressure they were under
[02:10:32.700 --> 02:10:34.140]  because they only found out they were doing it,
[02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:36.180]  like, eight days before.
[02:10:36.180 --> 02:10:37.780]  These events are now infomercials, right?
[02:10:37.780 --> 02:10:40.020]  They're, like, hour- and 30-minute infomercials.
[02:10:40.020 --> 02:10:42.260]  They're, like, ultra-produced.
[02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:43.180]  There's, like, a part of me that's like,
[02:10:43.180 --> 02:10:44.500]  yep, that's what it always was.
[02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:46.020]  I was just in a room.
[02:10:46.020 --> 02:10:48.220]  Like, let's have some production value.
[02:10:48.220 --> 02:10:52.380]  It's like they've changed from stage plays
[02:10:52.380 --> 02:10:54.060]  to TV shows, right?
[02:10:54.060 --> 02:10:54.900]  And guess what?
[02:10:54.900 --> 02:10:57.600]  More people like TV shows than stage plays.
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:10:58.440]  They do.
[02:10:58.440 --> 02:10:59.280]  It just brings out.
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:03.100]  And, you know, and so in terms of their popularity
[02:11:03.100 --> 02:11:05.580]  with the tens of millions of people
[02:11:05.580 --> 02:11:06.940]  who actually watch them,
[02:11:08.940 --> 02:11:10.660]  there's no doubt in my mind that people prefer
[02:11:10.660 --> 02:11:14.780]  the new non-staged format because it's more cinematic
[02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:18.740]  and more like a TV show, and it keeps the ball rolling
[02:11:18.740 --> 02:11:21.380]  in a way that here's four minutes of,
[02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:24.760]  not blathering, because if they're demoing your app
[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:27.440]  from Adobe, your eyes are glued to the screen.
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:29.220]  But if you don't use whatever it is
[02:11:29.220 --> 02:11:30.940]  that they're demoing, you know,
[02:11:30.940 --> 02:11:34.900]  Photoshop with 470 layers in a PSD file,
[02:11:34.900 --> 02:11:37.060]  you know, that's when you go check Twitter
[02:11:37.060 --> 02:11:39.340]  and see what people are saying about the event, right?
[02:11:39.340 --> 02:11:41.060]  The other thing I'll say is that, you know,
[02:11:41.060 --> 02:11:44.200]  the live events, live audience keeps you honest, right?
[02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:45.040]  Yeah.
[02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:48.500]  So they're able to alight some things
[02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:49.740]  in their presentations.
[02:11:49.740 --> 02:11:50.860]  Like, every company used to,
[02:11:50.860 --> 02:11:52.180]  I'm not, I don't mean a single at Apple,
[02:11:52.180 --> 02:11:54.580]  I just, we cover every, you know,
[02:11:54.580 --> 02:11:55.660]  there's a Google event next week,
[02:11:55.660 --> 02:11:57.500]  there's a Samsung event next week.
[02:11:57.500 --> 02:11:59.980]  We're in prep mode for all this stuff.
[02:11:59.980 --> 02:12:01.560]  But you see over the course of the pandemic,
[02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:05.820]  as these have become TV shows, infomercials,
[02:12:05.820 --> 02:12:07.400]  the companies have gotten,
[02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:10.140]  they're able to be more selective about what they say
[02:12:10.140 --> 02:12:12.580]  in a way that a live audience, you know,
[02:12:12.580 --> 02:12:14.240]  you would see people frowning at you.
[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:15.080]  Yeah.
[02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:15.980]  And you would, it keeps you honest.
[02:12:15.980 --> 02:12:17.380]  And then right after you'd get off stage
[02:12:17.380 --> 02:12:20.940]  and like have to go meet a bunch of journalists and people.
[02:12:20.940 --> 02:12:23.040]  Like, yeah, they don't have to do that anymore.
[02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:25.260]  So like, I think there's a back and forth here.
[02:12:25.260 --> 02:12:27.240]  Like, it's a TV show.
[02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:29.220]  It has all the upside of a TV show.
[02:12:29.220 --> 02:12:30.640]  It's well-produced, it's fun to watch.
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:31.780]  All the downside of a TV show,
[02:12:31.780 --> 02:12:35.120]  which is there's no built-in accountability mechanism.
[02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:37.860]  But that's like, eventually we get the stuff in our hands
[02:12:37.860 --> 02:12:39.100]  and that comes anyway.
[02:12:39.100 --> 02:12:40.820]  Anyway, I brought up the demos simply
[02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:43.020]  because I'll be interested to see
[02:12:43.020 --> 02:12:46.980]  who they've already brought in to,
[02:12:46.980 --> 02:12:49.980]  and gotten their buy-in, you know,
[02:12:49.980 --> 02:12:52.180]  Cinema 4D, I don't know who else, you know.
[02:12:52.180 --> 02:12:53.300]  That somebody is gonna come in and say,
[02:12:53.300 --> 02:12:56.380]  yes, Apple came to us with this chip
[02:12:56.380 --> 02:12:59.580]  and we recompiled our app to take advantage of it
[02:12:59.580 --> 02:13:00.980]  using the Metal APIs.
[02:13:00.980 --> 02:13:03.700]  And we were blown away because, blah.
[02:13:03.700 --> 02:13:06.580]  Here, look, here's how long it took before.
[02:13:06.580 --> 02:13:07.940]  Boom, here it is now.
[02:13:07.940 --> 02:13:09.380]  So I'd be looking for that.
[02:13:09.380 --> 02:13:10.220]  Yeah.
[02:13:10.220 --> 02:13:11.220]  I mean, I would say, oh, they're always like,
[02:13:11.220 --> 02:13:12.860]  and we did it in just three days.
[02:13:12.860 --> 02:13:14.220]  Oh yeah, always.
[02:13:14.220 --> 02:13:16.600]  But then it's because that's what Apple gave you.
[02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:17.940]  They gave you three days.
[02:13:17.940 --> 02:13:19.340]  Exactly.
[02:13:19.340 --> 02:13:21.900]  It's like, it turns out it's not that easy.
[02:13:21.900 --> 02:13:23.660]  No, it's always true.
[02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:25.660]  And then they're like, we did it in three days,
[02:13:25.660 --> 02:13:27.860]  but then the actual product that takes advantage of it
[02:13:27.860 --> 02:13:29.260]  comes out six months later.
[02:13:29.260 --> 02:13:30.380]  Right.
[02:13:30.380 --> 02:13:31.820]  That's always the case.
[02:13:31.820 --> 02:13:32.980]  I was like, you know how fast
[02:13:32.980 --> 02:13:34.900]  for this to come to your head?
[02:13:34.900 --> 02:13:38.060]  Right, we expect this to be coming early next year.
[02:13:38.060 --> 02:13:39.500]  And they're like, early next year,
[02:13:39.500 --> 02:13:42.900]  meaning any time, maybe November 2022.
[02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:45.380]  Anyway, we cannot finish the show
[02:13:45.380 --> 02:13:49.340]  without talking touch bar, which to me is an enormous,
[02:13:49.340 --> 02:13:52.700]  I am so excited because it seems like there's absolutely
[02:13:52.700 --> 02:13:56.180]  no leaks one way or the other as to what they're doing.
[02:13:56.180 --> 02:13:58.100]  Whatever it is they're unveiling next week
[02:13:58.100 --> 02:14:01.420]  seems like it, you know, famous last words
[02:14:01.420 --> 02:14:03.020]  before the weekend, because a lot of stuff
[02:14:03.020 --> 02:14:04.540]  sometimes leaks over weekends.
[02:14:04.540 --> 02:14:06.740]  But I always think that the reason a lot of stuff
[02:14:06.740 --> 02:14:09.940]  often leaked over weekends were rehearsals.
[02:14:09.940 --> 02:14:10.780]  Yeah.
[02:14:10.780 --> 02:14:11.860]  For live events.
[02:14:11.860 --> 02:14:15.100]  And that it inevitably was exposed to more people
[02:14:15.100 --> 02:14:17.340]  in the days before, whereas this is probably an event
[02:14:17.340 --> 02:14:20.100]  that they already have in the can ready to go.
[02:14:22.300 --> 02:14:24.300]  I'm super excited to find out
[02:14:24.300 --> 02:14:26.060]  what the answer is on touch bar.
[02:14:27.380 --> 02:14:29.900]  I am very curious.
[02:14:29.900 --> 02:14:33.180]  I think it's time to just call it.
[02:14:33.180 --> 02:14:35.940]  I just don't think it worked.
[02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:38.300]  And I think that, you know, you see the Air and the Pro,
[02:14:38.300 --> 02:14:40.060]  you see their consumer products.
[02:14:40.060 --> 02:14:43.340]  Usually when something works, they bring it to you, right?
[02:14:43.340 --> 02:14:44.180]  They bring it down.
[02:14:44.180 --> 02:14:46.540]  Like we started the show talking about iPhones,
[02:14:46.540 --> 02:14:50.940]  the new 13s have the same camera from the 13 Pro Max.
[02:14:50.940 --> 02:14:53.620]  Like that is remarkable because it worked.
[02:14:53.620 --> 02:14:54.460]  It was good.
[02:14:54.460 --> 02:14:56.540]  They invested the effort and figure it out.
[02:14:56.540 --> 02:14:58.300]  The touch bar is like,
[02:14:58.300 --> 02:15:00.260]  it's not adding enough value to anyone.
[02:15:00.260 --> 02:15:01.580]  They have no incentive.
[02:15:01.580 --> 02:15:03.580]  There's no call to push it down the line.
[02:15:03.580 --> 02:15:06.420]  And I think that is as strong of a sign as you can get
[02:15:06.420 --> 02:15:07.780]  that they should just walk away from it.
[02:15:07.780 --> 02:15:08.700]  Like we tried it.
[02:15:08.700 --> 02:15:09.660]  It was good.
[02:15:09.660 --> 02:15:10.900]  People like buttons better.
[02:15:10.900 --> 02:15:15.220]  I believe that the original touch bar shipped in 2016,
[02:15:15.220 --> 02:15:20.220]  five years old, has not changed at all, really.
[02:15:20.780 --> 02:15:24.540]  They've tweaked the size of it to restore
[02:15:24.540 --> 02:15:27.500]  the hardware escape key on the top left corner.
[02:15:27.500 --> 02:15:30.940]  So that, you know, but that's not changing the touch bar,
[02:15:30.940 --> 02:15:31.780]  right?
[02:15:31.780 --> 02:15:32.820]  They just sort of shrunk the touch bar
[02:15:32.820 --> 02:15:37.820]  and acknowledged, okay, having the touch bar
[02:15:38.620 --> 02:15:40.820]  will at least concede that it doesn't replace
[02:15:40.820 --> 02:15:44.500]  the advantages of an actual hardware escape key.
[02:15:44.500 --> 02:15:46.900]  Even though Apple's escape key story is very strange
[02:15:46.900 --> 02:15:51.220]  because they don't have an escape key on iPad keyboards,
[02:15:51.220 --> 02:15:52.540]  which drives me crazy.
[02:15:52.540 --> 02:15:55.500]  I keep, I always, I've typed so many tildes
[02:15:55.500 --> 02:15:58.700]  thinking I'm escaping out of something over the years.
[02:16:00.580 --> 02:16:04.300]  And they've tweaked the touch ID button
[02:16:04.300 --> 02:16:05.540]  in the top right corner.
[02:16:07.780 --> 02:16:12.740]  But I would say I'm ambivalent about the touch bar.
[02:16:12.740 --> 02:16:13.700]  I don't really hate it.
[02:16:13.700 --> 02:16:15.140]  I don't have strong feelings against it.
[02:16:15.140 --> 02:16:19.420]  I almost never use it though on my MacBook Pro.
[02:16:19.420 --> 02:16:22.540]  I also didn't really use the hardware buttons very much.
[02:16:22.540 --> 02:16:24.980]  And so I didn't have, I don't have strong feelings,
[02:16:24.980 --> 02:16:27.860]  but every single person I know who has strong feelings
[02:16:27.860 --> 02:16:29.300]  hates the touch bar.
[02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:30.140]  Yeah.
[02:16:30.140 --> 02:16:31.820]  I've installed software to mostly disable it.
[02:16:31.820 --> 02:16:33.100]  So POC is really good.
[02:16:34.100 --> 02:16:35.380]  It's really, it's much more stable now
[02:16:35.380 --> 02:16:36.820]  than it was maybe a year ago.
[02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:40.260]  In like, I am left-handed,
[02:16:40.260 --> 02:16:43.140]  and I'm gonna have told the story on the show before,
[02:16:43.140 --> 02:16:44.460]  but I'm left-handed and I,
[02:16:44.460 --> 02:16:46.540]  the way I hold my left hand on the keyboard
[02:16:46.540 --> 02:16:49.980]  means my pinky is always touching a button up there.
[02:16:49.980 --> 02:16:53.940]  And so, right, like the defaults for what happens
[02:16:53.940 --> 02:16:54.820]  in the touch bar is like,
[02:16:54.820 --> 02:16:56.820]  I was just like turning my brightness down all the time.
[02:16:56.820 --> 02:16:58.500]  Like it was, it was like, I was like,
[02:16:58.500 --> 02:17:00.540]  I need to turn this off.
[02:17:00.540 --> 02:17:03.220]  Like I'm constantly messing with my own computer.
[02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:06.100]  So yeah, so I installed POC, POC is great.
[02:17:06.100 --> 02:17:08.020]  But like, if you're installing software
[02:17:08.020 --> 02:17:10.220]  to make something less useful,
[02:17:10.220 --> 02:17:11.540]  like your instinct is like,
[02:17:11.540 --> 02:17:12.460]  I should just get rid of this.
[02:17:12.460 --> 02:17:13.820]  There was a funny time.
[02:17:13.820 --> 02:17:14.820]  What was the product?
[02:17:14.820 --> 02:17:15.660]  There was a funny one.
[02:17:15.660 --> 02:17:18.580]  It was like one of the MacBooks, MacBook Pros,
[02:17:18.580 --> 02:17:21.740]  they like, they moved the touch bar
[02:17:21.740 --> 02:17:25.740]  like one millimeter further from the number keys.
[02:17:25.740 --> 02:17:28.180]  And they're like, well, we think this will,
[02:17:28.180 --> 02:17:31.300]  this will eliminate unwanted touches.
[02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:33.060]  And people, you know, in the press,
[02:17:33.060 --> 02:17:33.900]  we're in the hands-on,
[02:17:33.900 --> 02:17:36.580]  we're like taking their existing MacBook Pros
[02:17:36.580 --> 02:17:37.980]  out of their MacBook to like look.
[02:17:37.980 --> 02:17:39.420]  And it's like, I, you know,
[02:17:39.420 --> 02:17:42.780]  and like without taking out like digital precise calipers,
[02:17:42.780 --> 02:17:44.500]  it was like, I guess I see it.
[02:17:44.500 --> 02:17:47.900]  I mean, are you serious that this is like the improvement?
[02:17:47.900 --> 02:17:50.660]  It's a very strange thing for five years in
[02:17:50.660 --> 02:17:52.660]  that it hasn't gotten better at all.
[02:17:52.660 --> 02:17:56.100]  So I, I think they made it
[02:17:56.100 --> 02:17:58.300]  because there was all that pressure then
[02:17:58.300 --> 02:17:59.460]  to put a touchscreen on the Mac.
[02:17:59.460 --> 02:18:00.540]  And you know, they, they said,
[02:18:00.540 --> 02:18:01.540]  this is how we're going to solve it.
[02:18:01.540 --> 02:18:03.780]  Like you want to touch stuff like,
[02:18:03.780 --> 02:18:05.820]  this is where your hands are.
[02:18:05.820 --> 02:18:09.180]  Well, I also think there's a general sense
[02:18:09.180 --> 02:18:10.660]  and because I perceive this,
[02:18:10.660 --> 02:18:13.220]  I think having a row of F keys up at the top,
[02:18:13.220 --> 02:18:16.300]  whether you use them as F4, F5, whatever,
[02:18:16.300 --> 02:18:20.060]  or use them as these dedicated brightness,
[02:18:20.900 --> 02:18:23.940]  desktop, play, pause, whatever.
[02:18:23.940 --> 02:18:25.140]  It's super finicky.
[02:18:25.140 --> 02:18:27.380]  It's a very old way of thinking about keyboards.
[02:18:27.380 --> 02:18:31.180]  Having a bunch of hardware keys is old fashioned
[02:18:31.180 --> 02:18:34.020]  and I perceive the lack of elegance of it.
[02:18:34.020 --> 02:18:35.940]  And so I see how this, you know,
[02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:37.980]  I think it killed two birds with one stone.
[02:18:37.980 --> 02:18:39.300]  What you said,
[02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:42.180]  we need to have a touchscreen story for MacBooks.
[02:18:42.180 --> 02:18:45.340]  And we've always been annoyed by these F keys.
[02:18:45.340 --> 02:18:46.500]  They're all sort of finicky.
[02:18:46.500 --> 02:18:50.380]  And once we print an icon on them that says, you know,
[02:18:50.380 --> 02:18:52.460]  volume up, volume down,
[02:18:52.460 --> 02:18:54.700]  it's got the icon printed on it, right?
[02:18:54.700 --> 02:18:56.100]  And you run into that whole problem
[02:18:56.100 --> 02:18:57.860]  that Steve Jobs talked about with the iPhone,
[02:18:57.860 --> 02:19:00.500]  that once you make these hardware buttons,
[02:19:00.500 --> 02:19:02.000]  you might come up with a new idea
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:03.420]  where you'd like to have something else.
[02:19:03.420 --> 02:19:04.540]  Well, we have an answer for it.
[02:19:04.540 --> 02:19:06.020]  It's called software, right?
[02:19:06.020 --> 02:19:07.180]  I get that thinking.
[02:19:07.180 --> 02:19:09.300]  It's just that in practice, it hasn't worked out.
[02:19:09.300 --> 02:19:10.140]  And it's-
[02:19:10.140 --> 02:19:11.420]  Yeah, this is the elegance thing to me.
[02:19:11.420 --> 02:19:12.640]  Right. Sure.
[02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:13.700]  But you know what I do all the time?
[02:19:13.700 --> 02:19:15.900]  I change the volume on my computer.
[02:19:15.900 --> 02:19:16.740]  Yep.
[02:19:16.740 --> 02:19:19.140]  Hardware buttons for that are really useful.
[02:19:19.140 --> 02:19:20.740]  And nobody complains about it, right?
[02:19:20.740 --> 02:19:23.040]  It's like, there's an annoyance in the back of your head
[02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:24.780]  if you see the inelegance of it.
[02:19:24.780 --> 02:19:27.260]  But on the other hand, in the real world, they just work.
[02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:28.520]  And nobody is ever like,
[02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:30.200]  I went to delete some text
[02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:32.300]  and accidentally changed the brightness.
[02:19:32.300 --> 02:19:33.820]  It just doesn't happen.
[02:19:33.820 --> 02:19:34.860]  Because you feel-
[02:19:34.860 --> 02:19:37.380]  Unless, wait, unless you have the touch bar.
[02:19:37.380 --> 02:19:39.820]  Right, because the actual volume button
[02:19:39.820 --> 02:19:41.760]  is this little tic-tac button.
[02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:44.860]  Your finger instantly knows that's not the delete key.
[02:19:44.860 --> 02:19:46.100]  So you don't press it.
[02:19:46.100 --> 02:19:48.300]  And just touching it doesn't do anything.
[02:19:48.300 --> 02:19:50.880]  It turns out just touching the touch bar
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:51.860]  does all sorts of things.
[02:19:51.860 --> 02:19:55.620]  So I would guess, if I had to bet,
[02:19:55.620 --> 02:19:56.740]  if I were a betting man,
[02:19:56.740 --> 02:19:58.980]  I bet they do not talk about it.
[02:19:58.980 --> 02:20:01.220]  They don't say anything about the touch bar.
[02:20:01.220 --> 02:20:02.820]  It's just gone.
[02:20:02.820 --> 02:20:03.660]  Yeah.
[02:20:03.660 --> 02:20:08.660]  That Twitter erupt with eruptions of joy.
[02:20:09.100 --> 02:20:11.100]  That it just has the same keyboard
[02:20:11.100 --> 02:20:12.380]  that the MacBook Air has
[02:20:12.380 --> 02:20:13.940]  with the touch ID up in the corner
[02:20:13.940 --> 02:20:15.580]  and just regular old-fashioned keys.
[02:20:15.580 --> 02:20:16.940]  And they don't talk about it.
[02:20:16.940 --> 02:20:20.500]  And they don't have to face me and you after the event.
[02:20:21.940 --> 02:20:24.660]  Where, of course, that would be the first thing we'd say
[02:20:24.660 --> 02:20:26.260]  when we saw them after the event is,
[02:20:26.260 --> 02:20:27.780]  hey, you didn't talk about the touch bar.
[02:20:27.780 --> 02:20:29.780]  What were you guys thinking about that?
[02:20:29.780 --> 02:20:33.320]  And then hear their practiced, ready-
[02:20:33.320 --> 02:20:34.160]  Yeah.
[02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:35.000]  Answer for it.
[02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.500]  But they won't have to see us except over Zoom,
[02:20:37.500 --> 02:20:38.500]  which is easier.
[02:20:41.300 --> 02:20:42.300]  That would be my bet.
[02:20:42.300 --> 02:20:45.460]  My outlandish what if would be
[02:20:45.460 --> 02:20:47.740]  what if there's a touch bar 2.0
[02:20:47.740 --> 02:20:49.740]  and it's truly, it's not a tweak.
[02:20:49.740 --> 02:20:52.460]  It is like a altogether new take on it.
[02:20:52.460 --> 02:20:54.500]  I don't know what that would be.
[02:20:54.500 --> 02:20:56.140]  But what if they have some cool things
[02:20:56.140 --> 02:20:59.180]  where it is a touch screen, it is dynamic,
[02:20:59.180 --> 02:21:02.620]  but it actually involves clickable buttons in some way.
[02:21:02.620 --> 02:21:03.460]  That'd be interesting.
[02:21:03.460 --> 02:21:04.700]  Like those old Razer keyboards.
[02:21:04.700 --> 02:21:05.540]  Yeah.
[02:21:05.540 --> 02:21:06.380]  Yep.
[02:21:06.380 --> 02:21:07.540]  Or the Stream Deck from Elgato.
[02:21:07.540 --> 02:21:08.380]  Yeah.
[02:21:08.380 --> 02:21:10.140]  There's a bunch of stuff on the Windows side, right?
[02:21:10.140 --> 02:21:14.740]  Like Windows laptops have been nuts for a while, right?
[02:21:14.740 --> 02:21:18.540]  So lots of experiments with making the track pad
[02:21:18.540 --> 02:21:19.700]  a touch pad.
[02:21:19.700 --> 02:21:23.180]  Lots of experiments of moving the entire keyboard deck
[02:21:23.180 --> 02:21:24.980]  down to the front of the machine,
[02:21:24.980 --> 02:21:26.260]  having a big screen there.
[02:21:26.260 --> 02:21:28.700]  Like, you know, Apple sees all this stuff.
[02:21:28.700 --> 02:21:30.400]  The Stream Deck, for people who don't know,
[02:21:30.400 --> 02:21:31.300]  my son has one.
[02:21:31.300 --> 02:21:33.220]  And he wanted it for Christmas last year.
[02:21:33.220 --> 02:21:35.220]  And he set it up, he has it like,
[02:21:35.220 --> 02:21:38.260]  he's like rigged out all of his home kit stuff
[02:21:38.260 --> 02:21:39.980]  and these lights on his wall with,
[02:21:39.980 --> 02:21:41.740]  and he's got custom icons for it.
[02:21:41.740 --> 02:21:43.020]  It's really cool.
[02:21:43.020 --> 02:21:45.660]  It's like an old fashioned phone dialer,
[02:21:45.660 --> 02:21:48.460]  like a grid of actual clickable buttons,
[02:21:48.460 --> 02:21:52.260]  but each button has its own LCD screen
[02:21:52.260 --> 02:21:55.260]  and you can make the screen show whatever you want.
[02:21:55.260 --> 02:21:58.540]  And so, you know, like a DJ could have a whole Stream Deck
[02:21:58.540 --> 02:22:02.720]  that is just rigged out with buttons for playing music.
[02:22:02.720 --> 02:22:05.620]  My son has his, you know, he has it dynamically changed.
[02:22:05.620 --> 02:22:08.020]  I don't know if he uses it for games or whatever,
[02:22:08.020 --> 02:22:11.180]  but for the most part, just shows a bunch of home kit stuff
[02:22:11.180 --> 02:22:12.860]  and he's got custom icons for it.
[02:22:12.860 --> 02:22:13.900]  It's really cool.
[02:22:13.900 --> 02:22:17.660]  Like the general idea of using screens for buttons
[02:22:17.660 --> 02:22:20.340]  so they can do different things and show different things.
[02:22:20.340 --> 02:22:21.700]  Cool idea.
[02:22:21.700 --> 02:22:25.380]  The Touch Bar, as we know it, for five frigging years
[02:22:26.480 --> 02:22:27.820]  is not it.
[02:22:27.820 --> 02:22:28.780]  Yeah.
[02:22:28.780 --> 02:22:30.900]  I think it'd be rad if they were like, you know what?
[02:22:30.900 --> 02:22:32.380]  We're doing keyboard in the front,
[02:22:32.380 --> 02:22:34.260]  the whole top of the machine is a touchscreen.
[02:22:34.260 --> 02:22:39.260]  Like the Windows PC makers are doing it all over the place.
[02:22:39.780 --> 02:22:40.940]  I don't know if it's a good idea.
[02:22:40.940 --> 02:22:45.780]  It's just, we haven't seen that level of big idea
[02:22:45.780 --> 02:22:47.980]  from Apple and laptop design for awhile.
[02:22:47.980 --> 02:22:49.780]  I'm like, you know, the most extreme ideas
[02:22:49.780 --> 02:22:51.300]  are always most interesting to me.
[02:22:51.300 --> 02:22:53.520]  The best idea they've had in recent years was,
[02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:55.500]  well, obviously the M1 chips was one
[02:22:55.500 --> 02:22:56.980]  and then the other one was going back
[02:22:56.980 --> 02:22:58.100]  to the old keyboard design.
[02:22:58.100 --> 02:22:59.540]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:22:59.540 --> 02:23:01.020]  But, which by the way, those modified keyboards,
[02:23:01.020 --> 02:23:02.340]  they also kept around for five years.
[02:23:02.340 --> 02:23:04.580]  Maybe like, there's just a five year limit
[02:23:04.580 --> 02:23:05.740]  on bad ideas at Apple.
[02:23:05.740 --> 02:23:07.060]  And then they just toss them out the window
[02:23:07.060 --> 02:23:09.660]  and say, here, you can just have the thing you liked before.
[02:23:09.660 --> 02:23:14.020]  Anyway, thank you, Nilay.
[02:23:14.020 --> 02:23:16.180]  This is always a pleasure.
[02:23:16.180 --> 02:23:18.600]  Very fun to speculate about next week's event
[02:23:18.600 --> 02:23:22.620]  because it's so fun to have so many surprises ahead of us.
[02:23:22.620 --> 02:23:23.540]  I'm looking forward to it.
[02:23:23.540 --> 02:23:25.740]  I also feel, I'm like you,
[02:23:25.740 --> 02:23:29.740]  I feel like it's going to be this weird race to order.
[02:23:29.740 --> 02:23:31.220]  Like, yeah, you had a tweet the other day.
[02:23:31.220 --> 02:23:33.660]  Like, I don't even need to know, just let me pre-order now.
[02:23:33.660 --> 02:23:36.800]  Like, let me get my pre-order in now.
[02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:38.300]  Whichever is the most expensive one.
[02:23:38.300 --> 02:23:40.500]  Just like, take the money.
[02:23:40.500 --> 02:23:42.980]  Yeah, just so that I get it as soon as possible.
[02:23:42.980 --> 02:23:44.520]  I would like to place my pre-order
[02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:46.220]  before the event at this time.
[02:23:46.220 --> 02:23:48.100]  I think that there are so many people
[02:23:48.100 --> 02:23:49.580]  who are gonna be listening to this podcast
[02:23:49.580 --> 02:23:50.860]  who are like, yes, that's me.
[02:23:50.860 --> 02:23:53.920]  I've been waiting with, I hear from them all the time.
[02:23:53.920 --> 02:23:56.620]  They're like, I, this has been like the hardest year
[02:23:56.620 --> 02:23:59.260]  of my life not to buy an M1 MacBook Pro
[02:23:59.260 --> 02:24:01.460]  because I've been waiting for the truly pro ones.
[02:24:01.460 --> 02:24:02.900]  I want a 16 inch.
[02:24:02.900 --> 02:24:04.900]  Please tell me that they're coming.
[02:24:04.900 --> 02:24:06.700]  I know you don't often know everything,
[02:24:06.700 --> 02:24:08.100]  but just tell me I'm all right.
[02:24:08.100 --> 02:24:08.940]  And I'm like, I've-
[02:24:08.940 --> 02:24:09.900]  Just soothe my soul.
[02:24:09.900 --> 02:24:11.860]  Yeah, and I'll write right back down.
[02:24:11.860 --> 02:24:15.020]  I'm like, I don't know no, but yeah, you know.
[02:24:15.020 --> 02:24:15.860]  I'll take-
[02:24:15.860 --> 02:24:17.220]  A lot of people reply to that tweet of mine.
[02:24:17.220 --> 02:24:18.500]  They're like, this is what Tesla does.
[02:24:18.500 --> 02:24:21.820]  Like, just give us, like, let, $100 pre-order.
[02:24:21.820 --> 02:24:22.660]  Right.
[02:24:22.660 --> 02:24:24.180]  And one day you'll get a Cybertruck.
[02:24:24.180 --> 02:24:26.700]  Like, whatever, just like psychologically
[02:24:26.700 --> 02:24:27.940]  close the loop for you.
[02:24:29.020 --> 02:24:31.340]  Everybody, of course, can follow you on Twitter.
[02:24:31.340 --> 02:24:35.660]  You are reckless, spelled R-E-C-K-L-E-S-S.
[02:24:35.660 --> 02:24:38.100]  And of course, your new podcast is excellent.
[02:24:38.100 --> 02:24:38.940]  Truly-
[02:24:38.940 --> 02:24:39.780]  Oh, thank you.
[02:24:39.780 --> 02:24:42.260]  Truly my favorite new podcast of 2021.
[02:24:42.260 --> 02:24:44.620]  I believe it's new to 2021, is that correct?
[02:24:44.620 --> 02:24:46.300]  It is, we're closing in on just a year of it.
[02:24:46.300 --> 02:24:48.940]  So we started very late 2020, so new 2021.
[02:24:48.940 --> 02:24:50.140]  Decoder, which is-
[02:24:50.140 --> 02:24:50.980]  Decoder.
[02:24:50.980 --> 02:24:53.420]  Which is also, I hate, I even hate to tell you this.
[02:24:53.420 --> 02:24:55.340]  God, what a great name.
[02:24:55.340 --> 02:24:57.860]  I, when that name, when that came out,
[02:24:57.860 --> 02:25:00.380]  I was like, well, that's gotta be already a,
[02:25:00.380 --> 02:25:02.460]  and it's like, no, nobody had a podcast in tech
[02:25:02.460 --> 02:25:03.300]  called Decoder.
[02:25:03.300 --> 02:25:05.860]  I was like, damn, that is a good name.
[02:25:05.860 --> 02:25:07.620]  Well, I gotta tell you, we, we took over
[02:25:07.620 --> 02:25:09.700]  Care Social Recode Decode feed.
[02:25:09.700 --> 02:25:11.500]  It's, so we, we, like, lucked.
[02:25:11.500 --> 02:25:13.740]  Like, we were like, wait, this is possible?
[02:25:13.740 --> 02:25:15.420]  And we, like, took it as soon as we could.
[02:25:15.420 --> 02:25:16.260]  Yeah.
[02:25:16.260 --> 02:25:18.080]  But it's also, it's, it's not just a cool word
[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:19.080]  and a cool sounding name.
[02:25:19.080 --> 02:25:21.300]  It actually is the gist of the show.
[02:25:21.300 --> 02:25:24.940]  It's you interviewing people about how they think
[02:25:24.940 --> 02:25:25.780]  and how they work.
[02:25:25.780 --> 02:25:29.360]  My favorite by far episode was the MKBHD interview,
[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:31.820]  which I think was like early, like February.
[02:25:31.820 --> 02:25:33.340]  It was early, yeah.
[02:25:33.340 --> 02:25:34.180]  But just fascinating.
[02:25:34.180 --> 02:25:36.540]  Cause it was like every single thing I've ever wanted
[02:25:36.540 --> 02:25:39.220]  to ask Marques Brownlee about like the,
[02:25:39.220 --> 02:25:41.900]  this incredible channel that he's built
[02:25:41.900 --> 02:25:43.360]  and presence that he's built.
[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:46.220]  You, it's like, you ask them and it was like,
[02:25:46.220 --> 02:25:47.040]  this is crazy.
[02:25:47.040 --> 02:25:49.340]  That's exactly what I've been dying to hear from
[02:25:49.340 --> 02:25:50.380]  Marques Brownlee.
[02:25:51.480 --> 02:25:53.260]  Totally decoded the,
[02:25:53.260 --> 02:25:58.080]  You know, my tiny plug, my thesis of the show is that
[02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:00.820]  we've gotten too used to taking things for granted in tech,
[02:26:00.820 --> 02:26:01.980]  specifically in tech.
[02:26:01.980 --> 02:26:04.260]  So like Marques, that's a business.
[02:26:04.260 --> 02:26:06.220]  He's running a very complicated business,
[02:26:06.220 --> 02:26:07.980]  multiple employees.
[02:26:07.980 --> 02:26:09.540]  And we're like, these videos are great.
[02:26:09.540 --> 02:26:13.200]  And there's a whole machine behind it that is worth
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:14.580]  thinking about.
[02:26:14.580 --> 02:26:16.860]  That we, I just interviewed, the last one was Dave Limp,
[02:26:16.860 --> 02:26:20.220]  who runs devices and services at Amazon.
[02:26:20.220 --> 02:26:23.000]  And like, I don't think I asked about one Alexa feature
[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:23.840]  the whole time.
[02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:27.600]  I was like, tell me how 10,000 people work on Alexa.
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:28.880]  What do they do?
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:31.420]  How do you organize their decisions?
[02:26:31.420 --> 02:26:34.260]  And I just, I, that's the stuff I was always been curious
[02:26:34.260 --> 02:26:36.100]  about and this is stuff you've always been curious about.
[02:26:36.100 --> 02:26:38.500]  So when I had the opportunity to make a show that just did
[02:26:38.500 --> 02:26:42.400]  that, as opposed to yelling about headphone checks.
[02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:43.240]  Right.
[02:26:43.240 --> 02:26:45.900]  There's this, which is like what most tech coverage is.
[02:26:45.900 --> 02:26:49.540]  Yeah, there's a huge space in between proprietary secrets
[02:26:49.540 --> 02:26:53.780]  that you know they're not going to tell you and interesting.
[02:26:53.780 --> 02:26:56.140]  Hey, how does, how do you actually do this amazing thing?
[02:26:56.140 --> 02:26:56.980]  Right?
[02:26:56.980 --> 02:26:59.260]  Like MKBHD, it's like 120 videos a year.
[02:26:59.260 --> 02:27:00.740]  How is that possible?
[02:27:00.740 --> 02:27:02.140]  There's only 360 days a year.
[02:27:02.140 --> 02:27:05.740]  How do you make 120 videos with that production quality?
[02:27:05.740 --> 02:27:06.580]  You know?
[02:27:06.580 --> 02:27:09.340]  And that, that was the gist of the interview.
[02:27:09.340 --> 02:27:13.660]  And the thing I will say, the thing I've learned the most
[02:27:13.660 --> 02:27:16.460]  from MKBHD to whoever else we've talked to,
[02:27:17.460 --> 02:27:20.340]  really smart people want to be challenged, right?
[02:27:20.340 --> 02:27:21.300]  They're competitive.
[02:27:21.300 --> 02:27:22.120]  They're smart.
[02:27:22.120 --> 02:27:23.300]  They've been thinking about it.
[02:27:23.300 --> 02:27:24.380]  You ask the questions, they're going to,
[02:27:24.380 --> 02:27:26.860]  they're going to tell you because they're excited
[02:27:26.860 --> 02:27:27.700]  to tell you.
[02:27:27.700 --> 02:27:31.300]  And I, I listen to a lot of other business and tech podcasts
[02:27:31.300 --> 02:27:34.220]  decoder doesn't have, there's like not a deference to it,
[02:27:34.220 --> 02:27:37.540]  like actively not a deference to it because our theories
[02:27:37.540 --> 02:27:39.680]  that people want to tell us that smart people want to be
[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:40.760]  challenged, it has been working out.
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:42.320]  So thank you for the compliment.
[02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:43.460]  I hope people don't listen to it.
[02:27:43.460 --> 02:27:45.420]  You know, I think people who like this show would love
[02:27:45.420 --> 02:27:48.220]  that show if they're not already subscribed.
[02:27:48.220 --> 02:27:51.920]  Anyway, fingers crossed that me and you were both happy
[02:27:51.920 --> 02:27:53.180]  come Monday afternoon.
[02:27:53.180 --> 02:27:55.820]  Just take the money, take the money, Jaws.
[02:27:55.820 --> 02:28:17.820]  I'm just waiting for you, buddy.
