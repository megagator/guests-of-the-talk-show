[00:00.000 --> 00:24.960]  See, and people say I don't have a theme song.
[00:24.960 --> 00:27.280]  I do have a theme song.
[00:27.280 --> 00:29.480]  I just use it very infrequently.
[00:29.480 --> 00:30.480]  This will make sense.
[00:30.480 --> 00:35.600]  It'll make sense why I brought the old Picking Boogers with John out of the archive.
[00:35.600 --> 00:39.120]  Later on in the show, it will make sense, but I don't know if you remember the back
[00:39.120 --> 00:40.120]  story on that.
[00:40.120 --> 00:49.720]  The back story on that is when I first took the show, went solo with it, dropped the partnership
[00:49.720 --> 00:53.600]  with Dan Benjamin, there was controversy.
[00:53.600 --> 00:57.360]  You could still go to the iTunes store and see comments from people who were very angry
[00:57.360 --> 01:00.920]  about this in 2013 or 2012, whenever the hell it was.
[01:00.920 --> 01:07.660]  But the second week of the show, I believe I had Adam Lisagor on and we addressed the
[01:07.660 --> 01:12.780]  controversy and Adam said that he doesn't care what I call the show, I could call it
[01:12.780 --> 01:15.720]  Picking Boogers with John and he would still listen.
[01:15.720 --> 01:24.200]  And then Adam and his friend and collaborator, Alex Weinstein, made a Picking Boogers with
[01:24.200 --> 01:27.960]  John.
[01:27.960 --> 01:28.960]  And that was it.
[01:28.960 --> 01:29.960]  That's good.
[01:29.960 --> 01:30.960]  So we used it.
[01:30.960 --> 01:31.960]  That's good.
[01:31.960 --> 01:32.960]  A couple of weeks.
[01:32.960 --> 01:33.960]  Anyway, it'll make sense.
[01:33.960 --> 01:34.960]  Later on in the show.
[01:34.960 --> 01:36.560]  How are you, Jim?
[01:36.560 --> 01:37.560]  I'm doing good.
[01:37.560 --> 01:38.880]  How are you doing?
[01:38.880 --> 01:41.920]  I'm doing great.
[01:41.920 --> 01:42.920]  Feeling good.
[01:42.920 --> 01:46.440]  Springtime weather's picking up, so you don't have that problem out there in California.
[01:46.440 --> 01:54.000]  You got good weather 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year until a mudslide
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.880]  comes and takes out your house.
[01:56.880 --> 01:57.880]  Or an earthquake.
[01:57.880 --> 01:58.880]  Right.
[01:58.880 --> 02:02.960]  Here in Philadelphia, we're enjoying finally some good weather.
[02:02.960 --> 02:03.960]  Really nice.
[02:03.960 --> 02:04.960]  Yeah.
[02:04.960 --> 02:05.960]  Well, you're just getting out of the deep freeze, though.
[02:05.960 --> 02:06.960]  Yeah.
[02:06.960 --> 02:07.960]  It was a long winter.
[02:07.960 --> 02:08.960]  It really felt like it.
[02:08.960 --> 02:16.160]  Well, it really felt like we did very few nice days in March or April.
[02:16.160 --> 02:17.160]  Lots going on.
[02:17.160 --> 02:18.160]  Nothing major, I guess.
[02:18.160 --> 02:23.240]  Have you seen this thing that's picked up again today where I believe she's the leading
[02:23.240 --> 02:29.640]  spokesperson on the issue is Casey Johnston, who's now an editor at The Outline.
[02:29.640 --> 02:34.980]  But she had a piece a couple of months ago about her MacBook Pro keyboard that got taken
[02:34.980 --> 02:43.580]  out by a single speck of dust, and she had a follow-up she published today that she effectively
[02:43.580 --> 02:44.640]  gave up.
[02:44.640 --> 02:45.640]  She got it fixed.
[02:45.640 --> 02:51.120]  It happened again, and she just gave up, sold it back to Apple, and has gone back to her
[02:51.120 --> 02:57.760]  2013 MacBook Pro, which she had never gotten rid of, and now she's happier.
[02:57.760 --> 02:58.920]  Tons of people online.
[02:58.920 --> 03:00.760]  I don't know what to make of this issue.
[03:00.760 --> 03:02.420]  I don't own one of these devices.
[03:02.420 --> 03:12.640]  We don't have everybody in our house has like a 2014-ish MacBook Pro.
[03:12.640 --> 03:18.200]  And I did not encounter any problems with the keyboard when I was reviewing the new
[03:18.200 --> 03:19.760]  MacBook Pros.
[03:19.760 --> 03:20.760]  What was that?
[03:20.760 --> 03:26.120]  It was released in late in 2016.
[03:26.120 --> 03:32.720]  The initial issue with this current MacBook Pro keyboard design was, A, the feel of it
[03:32.720 --> 03:38.600]  because this new butterfly mechanism has less travel, and in Apple's efforts to make ever
[03:38.600 --> 03:47.800]  thinner devices, this current keyboard design is physically a thinner mechanism.
[03:47.800 --> 03:51.920]  And the noise, right, that there were people, I believe Joanna Stern led the way on that
[03:51.920 --> 03:55.400]  issue, who just didn't like the sound that it made while typing.
[03:55.400 --> 03:58.000]  Well, people aren't talking about those issues anymore.
[03:58.000 --> 04:01.440]  What people are talking about is the fact that keys get stuck.
[04:01.440 --> 04:07.640]  Apparently, you could even people who I believe, and I swear up and down that they're very
[04:07.640 --> 04:11.920]  careful, that they're not like eating a sandwich over their keyboard or whatever.
[04:11.920 --> 04:14.360]  Well, but you'd laugh.
[04:14.360 --> 04:20.440]  But I'll tell you about my kid, because he uses his MacBook as his TV set.
[04:20.440 --> 04:26.200]  So when he's watching video, it's YouTube on his MacBook, and he does eat around his
[04:26.200 --> 04:27.200]  keyboard.
[04:27.200 --> 04:28.880]  It's disgusting.
[04:28.880 --> 04:31.360]  But yet his keys still work perfectly.
[04:31.360 --> 04:37.160]  He's had a problem with his space bar, but even when the key got stuck from him being
[04:37.160 --> 04:44.640]  a bit of a, you know, a bit crummy around the keyboard, it was possible to get it unstuck,
[04:44.640 --> 04:47.680]  whereas people, you know, are really running into problems.
[04:47.680 --> 04:49.240]  And I can't verify it.
[04:49.240 --> 04:55.960]  This is the thing I don't, you know, it seems, though, that this is something that is current
[04:55.960 --> 05:00.000]  to this device, like, and you never, you know, people who run into a problem are the people
[05:00.000 --> 05:01.640]  who are going to be vocal about it.
[05:01.640 --> 05:02.640]  Right.
[05:02.640 --> 05:05.560]  And so how many millions of these MacBooks are out there with people who don't have a
[05:05.560 --> 05:06.560]  problem with the keyboard?
[05:06.560 --> 05:07.560]  I don't know.
[05:07.560 --> 05:08.560]  You know, you don't hear from them.
[05:08.560 --> 05:10.360]  You hear from the people who have the problems.
[05:10.360 --> 05:14.080]  But it certainly seems anecdotally on Twitter, it certainly seems like there's an awful lot
[05:14.080 --> 05:17.520]  of people who have problems with this keyboard.
[05:17.520 --> 05:28.000]  See, I've had this particular problem with the keyboard twice.
[05:28.000 --> 05:29.000]  And and that's it.
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.720]  So, you know, you're talking about people eating over their keyboard or doing something
[05:33.720 --> 05:36.200]  over their keyboard.
[05:36.200 --> 05:41.160]  I can I can not eat over my keyboard, but then, you know, things get stuck in my beard
[05:41.160 --> 05:47.020]  and fall on the keyboard anyway, you know, an hour later or so.
[05:47.020 --> 05:50.640]  So I you know, it doesn't matter if I eat over it or not.
[05:50.640 --> 05:57.080]  I mean, I remember a few years back when I when I I tweeted that a pea just fell out
[05:57.080 --> 05:58.920]  of my beard on my keyboard.
[05:58.920 --> 06:04.880]  You know, I didn't remember the last time I had a pea, you know, just things get stuck
[06:04.880 --> 06:05.880]  in there.
[06:05.880 --> 06:07.240]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[06:07.240 --> 06:09.600]  I don't even 80 cues cars in there.
[06:09.600 --> 06:14.120]  I try almost never eat at my desk.
[06:14.120 --> 06:19.040]  But even, you know, every because I have these keyboards for so many years, every couple
[06:19.040 --> 06:24.480]  of years, I whatever, you know, my beloved Apple extended keyboard twos, I'll, you know,
[06:24.480 --> 06:28.200]  clean it, I'll just clean the key caps and, you know, use a little rubbing alcohol and
[06:28.200 --> 06:31.020]  a q tip and get in there and just, you know, make it look real nice.
[06:31.020 --> 06:34.740]  And it still amazes me once you get in there and start looking in between the gaps of the
[06:34.740 --> 06:39.800]  keys, how much stuff gets in there, even when you're, you know, it's not like I'm scrubbing
[06:39.800 --> 06:43.640]  up like a surgeon every time I sit down at my desk, but I, you know, my hands are clean
[06:43.640 --> 06:47.360]  and I don't eat there and still you get stuff in a keyboard, it happens, you know, that's
[06:47.360 --> 06:49.960]  just the way the world works.
[06:49.960 --> 06:55.600]  So it just isn't practical, you know, it being defend, you know, being able to defend against
[06:55.600 --> 07:01.840]  that and be reliable and work in the face of pieces of dust and crumbs, you know, really
[07:01.840 --> 07:07.120]  ought to be, you know, essential to any keyboard design.
[07:07.120 --> 07:10.720]  And I feel like we've reached like, we've reached like a tipping point on this issue
[07:10.720 --> 07:16.640]  where people are, you know, Marco Arment has done the same thing, I believe where he's
[07:16.640 --> 07:26.280]  he went and bought the, the Apple still sells a 15 inch MacBook Pro of the old design, you
[07:26.280 --> 07:30.880]  know, with the, you know, the older style USB ports and the old keyboard and stuff,
[07:30.880 --> 07:33.400]  you can still buy one of those brand new.
[07:33.400 --> 07:34.640]  So that's what Marco did.
[07:34.640 --> 07:40.760]  And I guess the ports were part of the issue, but you know, big part of it's the keyboard.
[07:40.760 --> 07:42.760]  That's just not a normal thing to happen.
[07:42.760 --> 07:48.520]  And I don't recall I've been a Mac user since before there were portable Macs, right?
[07:48.520 --> 07:52.540]  I mean, I remember I remember the original portable Mac, you know, it was called the
[07:52.540 --> 07:53.540]  portable Mac.
[07:53.540 --> 07:56.000]  It was like a 20 pound suitcase.
[07:56.000 --> 07:59.900]  Yeah, you needed a wagon to carry it around with you, right.
[07:59.900 --> 08:02.520]  But it was I wanted one so bad.
[08:02.520 --> 08:05.640]  It was it was like impossibly expensive.
[08:05.640 --> 08:10.320]  And then there was one that was so hot that, you know, one of the old black ones, I mean,
[08:10.320 --> 08:16.860]  it was burning up this this this keyboard thing, though, the two times that this has
[08:16.860 --> 08:25.860]  happened to me, and one was on the new style keys with the butterfly on a MacBook Pro,
[08:25.860 --> 08:27.780]  and the key wouldn't go down.
[08:27.780 --> 08:31.080]  So clearly, there was something stuck.
[08:31.080 --> 08:36.240]  And I just I just took my finger and, you know, banged it down and whatever it was,
[08:36.240 --> 08:37.240]  got loose.
[08:37.240 --> 08:38.240]  And that's it.
[08:38.240 --> 08:41.700]  That was one time that something happened.
[08:41.700 --> 08:45.280]  And it happened with one of the older ones.
[08:45.280 --> 08:48.560]  A couple years ago, it happened.
[08:48.560 --> 08:50.640]  And I think it was a spacebar at that point.
[08:50.640 --> 08:51.640]  Yeah.
[08:51.640 --> 08:54.660]  Other than that, nothing has gone wrong for me.
[08:54.660 --> 08:59.720]  And, you know, I am, I don't abuse the computers.
[08:59.720 --> 09:01.040]  But I don't baby them either.
[09:01.040 --> 09:03.960]  I mean, I don't think any of us really do.
[09:03.960 --> 09:09.000]  It can't be, it just can't be that every, you know, quote, unquote, everybody runs into
[09:09.000 --> 09:10.000]  the problem.
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.240]  I mean, it has to be some sort of minority of users.
[09:12.240 --> 09:17.760]  I mean, it just seems untenable that if if every everybody's keyboard did this within
[09:17.760 --> 09:20.160]  weeks.
[09:20.160 --> 09:24.340]  But anecdotally, it sure seems like whatever that minority is, it's way too big a number.
[09:24.340 --> 09:27.120]  And I'm really, I'm really curious how Apple is going to deal with this.
[09:27.120 --> 09:30.640]  There's, there's a fair amount of speculation just based on how long it's been since the
[09:30.640 --> 09:35.280]  last update that we might see new new Mac books at WWDC.
[09:35.280 --> 09:43.440]  And I'm really curious if they're doing something with the keyboard, you know, to, to, you know,
[09:43.440 --> 09:44.440]  defend against this.
[09:44.440 --> 09:52.280]  I'll be well, I don't know what they'll, what they could do, but I love the new keyboard.
[09:52.280 --> 09:58.440]  And I, when, when the new, remember when the butterfly first came out on the Mac book and
[09:58.440 --> 10:04.000]  the, the travel distance of the keys wasn't big enough.
[10:04.000 --> 10:06.760]  I mean, it almost felt like you weren't typing at all.
[10:06.760 --> 10:12.100]  And it actually took, you know, a few days just to get used to typing on that thing.
[10:12.100 --> 10:14.900]  So I didn't like that.
[10:14.900 --> 10:21.160]  But then when they came out with the, the Mac book pro, I, they, they increase the travel
[10:21.160 --> 10:25.120]  of when you push a key down, how far it'll travel down.
[10:25.120 --> 10:26.840]  And I loved it.
[10:26.840 --> 10:29.000]  That to me was the perfect thing.
[10:29.000 --> 10:32.680]  And I would not want to see them go back to anything else.
[10:32.680 --> 10:40.920]  I mean, the butterfly key works if you hit the corner of it or whatever.
[10:40.920 --> 10:42.120]  I just, I love it.
[10:42.120 --> 10:43.540]  Yeah, I do love that aspect of it.
[10:43.540 --> 10:44.540]  When it works perfectly.
[10:44.540 --> 10:45.540]  I do.
[10:45.540 --> 10:47.960]  There is a, a real premium feel to it.
[10:47.960 --> 10:52.040]  That, that aspect that when you press any part of the key, including the corner and
[10:52.040 --> 10:55.920]  the whole key moves down at the same time is very nice.
[10:55.920 --> 11:00.440]  I mean, so in theory, it's, it's a great keyboard, but in practice, obviously there's a problem.
[11:00.440 --> 11:05.060]  I mean, I would suggest, and I mean, Apple is just not the type of company that ever
[11:05.060 --> 11:08.080]  really quote unquote goes back to like an old design.
[11:08.080 --> 11:12.040]  They're not going to go back to the old keyboard design, but you got to, they've got to forge
[11:12.040 --> 11:18.600]  ahead and make a version of this keyboard or invent an entirely new keyboard that has
[11:18.600 --> 11:20.840]  the same benefits of it.
[11:20.840 --> 11:25.960]  That that is a lot more impervious to specs of dust.
[11:25.960 --> 11:31.920]  Well there, Apple continually improves everything that they make.
[11:31.920 --> 11:38.960]  So I have no doubt that they're, they're looking at how to improve this, but I don't think
[11:38.960 --> 11:41.000]  that they'll change the butterfly design.
[11:41.000 --> 11:50.080]  I think that the, um, the design of what they've done for the keyboard fits with everything
[11:50.080 --> 11:51.880]  that they were trying to do.
[11:51.880 --> 11:52.880]  Yeah.
[11:52.880 --> 11:59.960]  So, you know, now it's just a matter of, okay, it's somehow dust gets in there and how does
[11:59.960 --> 12:02.600]  that happen?
[12:02.600 --> 12:08.320]  So you know, maybe they'll, they'll put a little, I don't know, rubber catcher or something
[12:08.320 --> 12:09.320]  around the keys.
[12:09.320 --> 12:17.320]  I don't know, but you know what I do want to see the keyboard I want to see changed.
[12:17.320 --> 12:19.480]  The iPad smart cover keyboard.
[12:19.480 --> 12:28.200]  I don't, I don't like that at all because again, these can't get a crumb in that keyboard.
[12:28.200 --> 12:37.360]  You can't get a crumb there, but those, those keys on the iPad smart cover are small and
[12:37.360 --> 12:40.080]  they have room to make them bigger.
[12:40.080 --> 12:45.400]  I don't know why they don't, but I would like to see bigger keys and they wouldn't have
[12:45.400 --> 12:47.160]  to increase the size of the keyboard.
[12:47.160 --> 12:53.280]  Just make the keys bigger and make it more like the keyboard on the Mac book pro or the
[12:53.280 --> 12:55.600]  Mac book.
[12:55.600 --> 13:01.000]  And maybe, I don't know, I suppose I don't mind the texture of what's on there.
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.440]  I just don't like the small keys.
[13:03.440 --> 13:06.200]  I would like to see that changed.
[13:06.200 --> 13:11.120]  It doesn't make any sense to me why they, the keys are so small on that, that keyboard.
[13:11.120 --> 13:13.120]  Yeah, it is a little small.
[13:13.120 --> 13:15.000]  Yeah, I just don't like it.
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.800]  Does it seem like, do you think that there's enough room that they could make it, they
[13:17.800 --> 13:26.080]  could make the keys bigger without increasing the size of the actual iPad?
[13:26.080 --> 13:28.040]  Absolutely.
[13:28.040 --> 13:31.280]  There's a ton of room in there.
[13:31.280 --> 13:32.800]  That's what I don't understand.
[13:32.800 --> 13:38.640]  Why make those keys so small when there's already room built in there?
[13:38.640 --> 13:45.860]  I think it would just make it for a more comfortable experience to sit down and type on the iPad.
[13:45.860 --> 13:48.320]  I love using my iPad pro.
[13:48.320 --> 13:49.320]  I really do.
[13:49.320 --> 13:55.280]  And I know that, you know, like you, if I'm going to sit down and do work, I'm at my Mac.
[13:55.280 --> 14:01.440]  But when I go outside and sit down and I'm, you know, reading or researching stuff and
[14:01.440 --> 14:06.480]  doing a bit of writing, maybe I would love to have a bigger keys.
[14:06.480 --> 14:07.840]  I don't need a bigger keyboard.
[14:07.840 --> 14:10.560]  The keyboard's big enough, but bigger keys.
[14:10.560 --> 14:11.560]  Yeah.
[14:11.560 --> 14:12.560]  Well, I don't know.
[14:12.560 --> 14:18.040]  I worry because I don't really like that keyboard a lot either.
[14:18.040 --> 14:22.240]  So I've been using my iPad a lot lately with just no cover, just, you know, just use the
[14:22.240 --> 14:27.880]  software keyboard or I've been screwing around thanks to that bastard, Jason Snell, who got
[14:27.880 --> 14:32.880]  me to buy another keyboard.
[14:32.880 --> 14:39.400]  I was actually reading that, uh, you know, when you posted it, that, um, but he convinced
[14:39.400 --> 14:40.720]  it to buy this.
[14:40.720 --> 14:43.080]  I asked him, I didn't really like it.
[14:43.080 --> 14:45.680]  I mean, I asked him what he uses.
[14:45.680 --> 14:50.760]  He was, he had a post about, uh, how he writes from his kitchen just to, and I do the same
[14:50.760 --> 14:51.760]  thing too.
[14:51.760 --> 14:55.880]  I've, I do it a lot more than I used to, but just, uh, as somebody who works at home, just
[14:55.880 --> 14:59.880]  get up halfway through the day and sit somewhere else in the house, you know, don't sit at
[14:59.880 --> 15:03.680]  the same desk in the same chair for eight straight hours.
[15:03.680 --> 15:08.800]  Um, so I asked him how he worked and he'd said he was using this Matthias, uh, I think
[15:08.800 --> 15:12.520]  that's how you pronounce it, laptop pro, uh, which is crazy to me.
[15:12.520 --> 15:18.600]  I would never, ever use, almost never, ever use an external keyboard with a laptop unless
[15:18.600 --> 15:23.200]  I had like permanently docked a laptop, you know, I wasn't even using it as a laptop,
[15:23.200 --> 15:28.360]  you know, like if I just got like an eye, like a stand and kept my Mac book on my desk
[15:28.360 --> 15:31.040]  almost as like use it as like a desktop.
[15:31.040 --> 15:36.960]  Um, it just seems weird to me that they've marketed a keyboard as being for use with
[15:36.960 --> 15:39.360]  a laptop when laptops come with keyboards.
[15:39.360 --> 15:45.300]  But maybe God, you know, going back to our earlier discussion, maybe that's the workaround
[15:45.300 --> 15:51.360]  for everybody with the stuck keys on their Mac books is use, use another keyboard.
[15:51.360 --> 15:58.320]  Um, but anyway, I bought that keyboard and was using it with the iPad and, uh, uh, did,
[15:58.320 --> 15:59.480]  did you like it?
[15:59.480 --> 16:05.640]  Uh, I like it more than I like most keyboards and I definitely agree with Jason's assessment
[16:05.640 --> 16:11.300]  that while I would never be confused thinking it was an Apple extended keyboard too, it's
[16:11.300 --> 16:17.880]  the closest of any other keyboard in feel to an Apple extended keyboard twos keys that
[16:17.880 --> 16:24.660]  I've ever used, including several keyboards from the same company, Mattias over the years
[16:24.660 --> 16:28.560]  that were advertised as being similar to the Apple extended keyboard too.
[16:28.560 --> 16:33.360]  I was always very disappointed in any other keyboards, at least in terms of their Apple
[16:33.360 --> 16:37.280]  extended to likeness, if that makes sense.
[16:37.280 --> 16:44.240]  Let's see that keyboard that you're talking about is 170 bucks.
[16:44.240 --> 16:48.840]  I want, as soon as I saw that, I had said to myself, don't buy that keyboard.
[16:48.840 --> 16:51.400]  And then I spent like the next hour thinking I should buy that keyboard.
[16:51.400 --> 17:02.000]  I should buy that keyboard, keyboard, and then I got, and then I got worried.
[17:02.000 --> 17:06.440]  I got worried because we were tweeting about it and I got worried that other people would
[17:06.440 --> 17:11.040]  see the tweets about it and think the same thing and then the place would be sold out
[17:11.040 --> 17:12.040]  of them.
[17:12.040 --> 17:13.760]  So I hurried up and bought one and I said that.
[17:13.760 --> 17:18.880]  And then, I don't know if he was joking or not, but I said that I got spooked that they
[17:18.880 --> 17:22.040]  were going to sell out now that we linked to it.
[17:22.040 --> 17:27.400]  So I quick bought one and then Merlin Mann said he did the same thing, bought one in
[17:27.400 --> 17:28.400]  a pair now.
[17:28.400 --> 17:30.400]  And then I think that they actually did sell out.
[17:30.400 --> 17:32.180]  I think that they did sell out of them.
[17:32.180 --> 17:37.040]  So I actually wasn't wrong or at least they're back on, I don't know if that's the right
[17:37.040 --> 17:38.040]  term.
[17:38.040 --> 17:43.200]  Well, Merlin probably bought all of them, the rest of the stock.
[17:43.200 --> 17:48.840]  It was that company, Matthias, that didn't they have the first Qlikki keyboard way back?
[17:48.840 --> 17:52.600]  No, not the first one, but they were the first one, they were one of the first ones that
[17:52.600 --> 17:53.600]  I can remember.
[17:53.600 --> 17:57.320]  They've been doing, they've been making Qlikki mechanical keyboards for as long as,
[17:57.320 --> 18:06.720]  you know, at least since like the nineties, you know, and they very, I think I first heard
[18:06.720 --> 18:11.760]  of them back in the nineties on tidbits, you know, I don't know if it was Adam Angst himself
[18:11.760 --> 18:16.400]  or somebody else who wrote for tidbits at the time, but somebody who like me was a fan
[18:16.400 --> 18:23.320]  of the Apple extended keyboard too, you know, first brought my attention to their Qlikki
[18:23.320 --> 18:24.320]  keyboards.
[18:24.320 --> 18:27.600]  But the problem is it's like there's so many and Jason's got more keyboards than
[18:27.600 --> 18:33.640]  I do, but there's so many and it's kind of a cool thing because it's like the industry,
[18:33.640 --> 18:38.640]  you know, like in the eighties, all the keyboards were Qlikki and then they stopped making Qlikki
[18:38.640 --> 18:43.800]  keyboards and people who liked them, you know, would go to great lengths.
[18:43.800 --> 18:49.360]  Like the PC people would, you know, their version of the Apple extended keyboard too
[18:49.360 --> 18:53.280]  is the IBM model M, I think it's called, I forget.
[18:53.280 --> 18:56.280]  I've never been a fan of it, but it's really Qlikki.
[18:56.280 --> 19:00.640]  It's the one with a buckling spring and it's like if you've ever used a PC, like
[19:00.640 --> 19:04.200]  in the eighties, you know exactly what this key, it is loud.
[19:04.200 --> 19:08.040]  It sounds like a gun going off or something.
[19:08.040 --> 19:09.880]  Can you imagine a whole room of those?
[19:09.880 --> 19:10.880]  I know.
[19:10.880 --> 19:11.880]  It's kind of hard to imagine.
[19:11.880 --> 19:16.560]  Like the keyboard I like, the Apple extended keyboard too, certainly is louder than like
[19:16.560 --> 19:22.400]  a current, you know, Apple professional keyboard, whatever they call it.
[19:22.400 --> 19:27.120]  But it's not loud, whereas the IBM one was loud.
[19:27.120 --> 19:29.800]  But it's kind of cool.
[19:29.800 --> 19:35.080]  There's so many companies now making mechanical keyboards and you have so much choice in terms
[19:35.080 --> 19:40.400]  of the switches that you can get, it's crazy.
[19:40.400 --> 19:41.920]  Every once in a while I get off on keyboards here.
[19:41.920 --> 19:47.560]  I should wait till Jason's on the show because you don't care.
[19:47.560 --> 19:52.280]  Well, I'm a fan of the latest keyboards.
[19:52.280 --> 19:53.280]  I really am.
[19:53.280 --> 19:59.680]  Did you buy one of the space black ones now that they sell them separately?
[19:59.680 --> 20:00.680]  No.
[20:00.680 --> 20:01.680]  Did you see that?
[20:01.680 --> 20:05.560]  Yeah, Apple is now selling those separately, the space black, the things that come with
[20:05.560 --> 20:12.000]  the iMac Pro, the keyboard, the mouse and the trackpad in space black.
[20:12.000 --> 20:19.160]  And they cost 20 bucks more than the regular silver versions, which I love.
[20:19.160 --> 20:24.520]  I love it when Apple charges more for the same thing in a different color and it's always
[20:24.520 --> 20:25.520]  for the black.
[20:25.520 --> 20:32.840]  I love it when they had the black MacBooks and they cost like $200 more than the white
[20:32.840 --> 20:33.840]  ones.
[20:33.840 --> 20:34.840]  Well, they were black.
[20:34.840 --> 20:35.840]  Right.
[20:35.840 --> 20:37.320]  That makes perfect sense.
[20:37.320 --> 20:44.240]  Of course they are.
[20:44.240 --> 20:46.720]  I have a question for you.
[20:46.720 --> 20:51.760]  Do you listen to any of the shows on Beats 1?
[20:51.760 --> 20:54.960]  No, not really.
[20:54.960 --> 21:01.480]  So I've always been a big fan of talk radio.
[21:01.480 --> 21:03.520]  I don't know if you listen to talk radio or not.
[21:03.520 --> 21:04.520]  I used to.
[21:04.520 --> 21:09.140]  When I used to have a commute, I mean, that's been a long time though.
[21:09.140 --> 21:16.280]  In Canada, I would listen to CBC, which I guess is like NPR down here, but I'd never
[21:16.280 --> 21:19.640]  really gotten into Beats 1.
[21:19.640 --> 21:29.000]  And I just started listening today to Lars Ulrich's Beats 1 show.
[21:29.000 --> 21:35.100]  And it kind of mixes talk radio with, he was interviewing Jack White about his new album,
[21:35.100 --> 21:39.280]  which is weird as hell.
[21:39.280 --> 21:49.520]  So I was listening to that and it made me think of talk radio and that's the kind of
[21:49.520 --> 21:52.400]  show that I think I might enjoy on Beats 1.
[21:52.400 --> 21:59.040]  So I just kind of had it on in the background when I was sitting there working, when the
[21:59.040 --> 22:07.120]  jackhammer stopped construction outside my house, the jackhammer started like seven o'clock
[22:07.120 --> 22:12.200]  in the morning and jolted right out of bed.
[22:12.200 --> 22:19.200]  Anyway, I just thought that was, I haven't gotten into any show on Beats 1, but I listened
[22:19.200 --> 22:20.960]  to that one today and thought it was really good.
[22:20.960 --> 22:22.400]  How does that work?
[22:22.400 --> 22:23.400]  Is that live?
[22:23.400 --> 22:24.400]  Right?
[22:24.400 --> 22:27.880]  This is how little I know about it.
[22:27.880 --> 22:32.560]  When you tune into it, do you get to decide when to start it or is it like whatever they're
[22:32.560 --> 22:35.340]  talking about right now is what you're listening to?
[22:35.340 --> 22:39.480]  So there's all kinds of different shows on Beats 1.
[22:39.480 --> 22:41.660]  They're about an hour long each.
[22:41.660 --> 22:48.880]  So if you go in and just press the Beats 1 button, it'll play whatever's live right now.
[22:48.880 --> 22:52.480]  But you can go back and listen to shows on demand.
[22:52.480 --> 22:53.480]  So that's what I did.
[22:53.480 --> 22:59.000]  I went to Lars' show and listened to the Jack White interview that was done, I don't know,
[22:59.000 --> 23:00.000]  a few weeks ago.
[23:00.000 --> 23:01.000]  Yeah.
[23:01.000 --> 23:02.880]  So yeah, you can listen to them on demand.
[23:02.880 --> 23:03.880]  Yeah.
[23:03.880 --> 23:05.720]  So you can go back and listen to all of them.
[23:05.720 --> 23:09.880]  Well, while we're talking about this, let me take a break here and it's a perfect segue
[23:09.880 --> 23:11.860]  and thank our first sponsor.
[23:11.860 --> 23:14.480]  And it is Vox's new podcast.
[23:14.480 --> 23:20.520]  It's a daily podcast from Vox, V-O-X, and it's called Today Explained.
[23:20.520 --> 23:26.800]  Every weekday afternoon, Vox's host, Sean Rommisfurm, takes you on a deep dive into
[23:26.800 --> 23:29.560]  the most important story of the day.
[23:29.560 --> 23:32.320]  By the time you get home, you'll not only understand the biggest events happening in
[23:32.320 --> 23:35.080]  the world, but you'll be able to explain them to your family and friends.
[23:35.080 --> 23:41.640]  It's like a deep dive on something in the news every day, every afternoon, a new episode.
[23:41.640 --> 23:45.480]  Here's some examples of some of the recent episodes from the show, the algorithms that
[23:45.480 --> 23:52.080]  are changing the porn industry, Mark Zuckerberg's response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal,
[23:52.080 --> 23:58.440]  the Mueller investigation ravaging through U.S. politics, guns, the teacher strike in
[23:58.440 --> 23:59.440]  West Virginia.
[23:59.440 --> 24:02.280]  That's a real interesting thing going on in the U.S., these teacher strikes that are really
[24:02.280 --> 24:07.480]  picking up the war in Syria.
[24:07.480 --> 24:08.480]  Here's one.
[24:08.480 --> 24:11.000]  This might perk your ears, Jim.
[24:11.000 --> 24:18.240]  They have an episode where they used ACDC to explain gerrymandering.
[24:18.240 --> 24:20.280]  I have to look that episode up.
[24:20.280 --> 24:23.240]  I've got to find that episode.
[24:23.240 --> 24:24.240]  And more.
[24:24.240 --> 24:25.240]  All sorts of stuff.
[24:25.240 --> 24:30.400]  Politics, current events, ACDC, it's a great show.
[24:30.400 --> 24:33.760]  Every afternoon, and you can get it anywhere you get your podcasts, you can get them from
[24:33.760 --> 24:38.200]  Apple's podcast on iTunes, you can get them on Stitcher, Overcast, I'll put links in the
[24:38.200 --> 24:49.480]  show notes with all the various places where you can subscribe to Vox's Today Explained.
[24:49.480 --> 24:50.480]  It's really great.
[24:50.480 --> 24:53.600]  And it's really, really easy to subscribe.
[24:53.600 --> 24:56.220]  And I recommend you do.
[24:56.220 --> 25:01.640]  So anyway, before we wrap, I don't know that we tied a bow on this MacBook keyboard issue.
[25:01.640 --> 25:05.760]  I'm sorry, I interrupted with talk radio.
[25:05.760 --> 25:06.760]  I don't know.
[25:06.760 --> 25:11.420]  But really, and I don't think it's the sort of thing that Apple is going to talk about.
[25:11.420 --> 25:16.600]  It's not like Phil Schuler is going to get up there on stage at WWDC and say, you know,
[25:16.600 --> 25:19.640]  pieces of dust, we're getting stuck in a keyboard and we fixed it, right?
[25:19.640 --> 25:21.960]  They're just like, they might talk.
[25:21.960 --> 25:25.920]  If they do make improvements to the keyboard, they can say, you know, they'll say it's better
[25:25.920 --> 25:30.600]  and more reliable than ever or something like that.
[25:30.600 --> 25:35.440]  But I think somebody on Twitter asked me today, like, let's say Apple does fix this.
[25:35.440 --> 25:40.680]  Let's say they come out with new MacBooks and MacBook Pros at WWDC.
[25:40.680 --> 25:48.480]  And however they fix it, you know, they've got keyboards now that don't get stuck.
[25:48.480 --> 25:49.900]  How do they get word out about that?
[25:49.900 --> 25:53.120]  If they're not going to, because if they don't talk about it, how does word get out about
[25:53.120 --> 25:54.120]  it?
[25:54.120 --> 26:02.980]  Well, I think that if they did do that, they would not mention it in the keynote, but maybe
[26:02.980 --> 26:09.360]  in the briefings that we have afterwards, they might say, hey, right.
[26:09.360 --> 26:17.360]  They might say, you know, hey, John, just so you know, we put, you know, rubber barrier
[26:17.360 --> 26:18.360]  around there.
[26:18.360 --> 26:22.500]  So now the keyboards won't get stuck, but they still work the same, you know, and then
[26:22.500 --> 26:28.340]  you can put that in your, your notes and, and that's how they'll get the word out.
[26:28.340 --> 26:35.600]  And otherwise, I mean, if you think between the the keyboard for the MacBook and the keyboard
[26:35.600 --> 26:43.180]  for the MacBook Pro, they never said anything, but we noticed that, you know, the, the travel
[26:43.180 --> 26:45.680]  distance was a lot longer.
[26:45.680 --> 26:49.920]  So we knew that they made some adjustments and when I questioned them on it, they did
[26:49.920 --> 26:56.460]  tell me and gave me some specs on that, that I wrote about, about how much they increase
[26:56.460 --> 27:00.000]  the travel distance and, you know, all that kind of stuff.
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.800]  So that's how they get the word out about that, but I don't think that they'll mention
[27:04.800 --> 27:05.800]  it.
[27:05.800 --> 27:06.800]  Yeah.
[27:06.800 --> 27:08.740]  I don't think so either.
[27:08.740 --> 27:10.520]  But I really feel like they got it.
[27:10.520 --> 27:15.720]  They've, I don't know, I feel lucky that I've got this, you know, I got my MacBook Pro that
[27:15.720 --> 27:20.800]  I'm still very happy with right before this changeover, because that would, it would drive
[27:20.800 --> 27:22.560]  me nuts if I had that problem.
[27:22.560 --> 27:27.360]  And I said before, a couple episodes ago, I was talking about this with somebody else.
[27:27.360 --> 27:33.920]  To my memory on every MacBook, going back to power books, you know, whatever I book
[27:33.920 --> 27:41.360]  I had for a couple of years, every lap Apple laptop I've ever had, I don't think I've ever
[27:41.360 --> 27:44.360]  once had a problem with keys getting stuck.
[27:44.360 --> 27:50.100]  And I guess it's not fair to look at it historically, because the older ones from 1015 years ago,
[27:50.100 --> 27:55.240]  were so much thicker and had so much more travel that it's, it's really like comparing
[27:55.240 --> 27:56.320]  apples and oranges.
[27:56.320 --> 28:01.280]  But even on the reason you think those ones would get more things stuck in them, I guess
[28:01.280 --> 28:03.760]  but somehow that never was a problem for me.
[28:03.760 --> 28:08.960]  I've never had it would drive me crazy if I did felt like, you know, every couple days,
[28:08.960 --> 28:10.440]  my end key gets stuck.
[28:10.440 --> 28:16.600]  And I don't know if it has, if I don't know if there's any correlation, like are certain
[28:16.600 --> 28:22.280]  keys more likely to be stuck than others because of the location on the keyboard, or how often
[28:22.280 --> 28:23.280]  you type them?
[28:23.280 --> 28:24.400]  I don't know.
[28:24.400 --> 28:26.960]  But I saw some and somebody else had the problem.
[28:26.960 --> 28:32.200]  And it seems fairly common to with these Mac books where they type, let's just say the
[28:32.200 --> 28:36.960]  letter B, and like one out of 10 times when they try to type one letter B, they get two
[28:36.960 --> 28:40.720]  B's in their text, that would drive me crazy.
[28:40.720 --> 28:44.000]  That would Yeah, that would see that doesn't happen to me.
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.920]  I mean, I'm on the thing all day long.
[28:46.920 --> 28:48.400]  I'm outside with it.
[28:48.400 --> 28:49.400]  I'm inside.
[28:49.400 --> 28:54.520]  I'm, you know, things fall out of my beard on it.
[28:54.520 --> 28:58.120]  None of this stuff happens.
[28:58.120 --> 28:59.760]  I tried a different keyboard recently.
[28:59.760 --> 29:06.600]  I have a real problem here, Jim, I bought this Microsoft folding keyboard.
[29:06.600 --> 29:13.800]  It's a portable keyboard, Bluetooth, and it folds up into it's the tiniest little package.
[29:13.800 --> 29:20.360]  And it folds in half like in between, like the T and Y and the G and H and the B and
[29:20.360 --> 29:21.360]  N keys.
[29:21.360 --> 29:27.440]  And so there's a little gap between the two sides.
[29:27.440 --> 29:33.200]  And I it's really nice and Microsoft makes good keyboard, they've always made good keyboards
[29:33.200 --> 29:34.200]  and mice, right?
[29:34.200 --> 29:39.920]  They've bizarrely, you know, for as much as I gripe about their software design.
[29:39.920 --> 29:43.960]  Their peripherals have always been very good and as good key travels feels, you know, like
[29:43.960 --> 29:47.180]  a laptop keyboard.
[29:47.180 --> 29:52.760]  But I can't use it because the way that it's split on the two sides here, I'll send you
[29:52.760 --> 29:58.560]  a send you a picture here, you can take a look.
[29:58.560 --> 30:03.080]  The way it's split, the Y is on the right side.
[30:03.080 --> 30:04.160]  And I didn't even realize this.
[30:04.160 --> 30:07.320]  I've never been a fan of split keyboards, but I've never really tried using one.
[30:07.320 --> 30:12.840]  But it turns out that I've got 30 years of habit using my left index finger to type the
[30:12.840 --> 30:16.520]  letter Y, which I guess is it.
[30:16.520 --> 30:20.120]  And now that I look at the keyboard, I have no idea how I developed this habit because
[30:20.120 --> 30:27.920]  Y is clearly closer to my right index finger than to my left, but I type with my left.
[30:27.920 --> 30:33.360]  And there is zero percent chance like I tried using this keyboard to do like email for like
[30:33.360 --> 30:40.240]  an hour and every single time that I tried to type a Y and I wasn't actively thinking
[30:40.240 --> 30:43.280]  about this keyboard, I'd use my left finger.
[30:43.280 --> 30:48.100]  It would go up next to the T and there's no Y there.
[30:48.100 --> 30:52.200]  And every single time it drove me nuts and it just made me think that it's sort of like
[30:52.200 --> 30:56.760]  this must be what it's like for these people with the MacBook keyboard where it, you know,
[30:56.760 --> 30:58.540]  some of their keys are unreliable.
[30:58.540 --> 31:04.320]  It's incredibly distracting, like if you're used to being able to just not give any thought
[31:04.320 --> 31:09.240]  at all to your keyboard and just concentrate on what you're writing.
[31:09.240 --> 31:12.040]  It's it is incredibly distracting.
[31:12.040 --> 31:16.220]  It's that's, that's a pretty big gap.
[31:16.220 --> 31:17.280]  It is a pretty big gap.
[31:17.280 --> 31:21.000]  And the other thing too, see, and if you look at that, I'll put this link, I promise to
[31:21.000 --> 31:22.280]  put it in the show notes, folks.
[31:22.280 --> 31:27.880]  But if you look what they did to not have jagged sides between them is they made like
[31:27.880 --> 31:33.920]  the T key double width and the end key is double width just so that it, you know, makes
[31:33.920 --> 31:35.420]  a nice border.
[31:35.420 --> 31:41.880]  What I wish that they would do if I were designing a split keyboard is I would put two Y's on
[31:41.880 --> 31:46.720]  the keyboard, one on each side, and I would do the same thing with the B, but only you
[31:46.720 --> 31:47.720]  would need that.
[31:47.720 --> 31:51.400]  Well, I think that there's probably other, I'll bet there's a lot of people out there
[31:51.400 --> 31:52.720]  who have weird typing habits.
[31:52.720 --> 31:53.720]  I'll bet.
[31:53.720 --> 31:58.640]  Well, I'm sure, but in order to incorporate all those weird typing habits, the keyboard
[31:58.640 --> 32:03.160]  would would look like Homer Simpson's car or something.
[32:03.160 --> 32:06.000]  No, I just want two Y keys and two B keys.
[32:06.000 --> 32:12.380]  And I think that these double width T and N keys look goofy anyway.
[32:12.380 --> 32:14.000]  They do look goofy.
[32:14.000 --> 32:16.160]  But why is the space so big?
[32:16.160 --> 32:18.160]  Do they need that to really fold it?
[32:18.160 --> 32:20.400]  Yeah, I don't see how you could and it does.
[32:20.400 --> 32:21.760]  It folds up really nicely.
[32:21.760 --> 32:27.560]  I mean, if I could use it, it was a longtime reader at the site recommended it to me and
[32:27.560 --> 32:35.640]  what he does a lot of the time is he'll just take like his iPhone and a little stand,
[32:35.640 --> 32:40.000]  a little portable stand that folds up and this keyboard and go to a coffee shop and
[32:40.000 --> 32:46.120]  just sort of go through, you know, email with just using his iPhone and this keyboard.
[32:46.120 --> 32:51.200]  And it really folds up into, you know, just a tiniest little package with a phone.
[32:51.200 --> 32:52.520]  It's really small.
[32:52.520 --> 32:57.120]  Well, this one's only $100 so you're getting cheaper.
[32:57.120 --> 33:01.960]  Do they have pictures of it folded?
[33:01.960 --> 33:04.320]  Oh, there's I saw them somewhere.
[33:04.320 --> 33:05.320]  Oh, yeah.
[33:05.320 --> 33:06.320]  Scroll down.
[33:06.320 --> 33:07.320]  Scroll down a little bit.
[33:07.320 --> 33:08.320]  Oh, yeah.
[33:08.320 --> 33:09.320]  There it is.
[33:09.320 --> 33:10.320]  Okay.
[33:10.320 --> 33:11.320]  Yeah.
[33:11.320 --> 33:12.320]  It folds up really, really small.
[33:12.320 --> 33:16.240]  I have a problem, Jim.
[33:16.240 --> 33:23.320]  You know, I'm going to do an intervention for I don't know why it reminded me of this
[33:23.320 --> 33:30.640]  was thinking about how I developed my bad, mostly bad touch typing abilities.
[33:30.640 --> 33:34.680]  I can't believe that I've touched type Y with the wrong finger.
[33:34.680 --> 33:35.880]  It's really driving me crazy.
[33:35.880 --> 33:42.300]  I learned to type in seventh grade, we had to take a typing course in seventh grade.
[33:42.300 --> 33:50.160]  And it was using manual typewriters like no electronics at all, just like the old click
[33:50.160 --> 33:55.680]  clack manual typewriters, which in hindsight is crazy.
[33:55.680 --> 34:03.660]  And they were special type instructional typewriters that didn't have printed key caps.
[34:03.660 --> 34:08.000]  So all those keys were blank because that, you know, it was that way you couldn't cheat
[34:08.000 --> 34:09.000]  by like looking down.
[34:09.000 --> 34:12.940]  You were supposed to learn to memorize it.
[34:12.940 --> 34:14.640]  And I did terribly in this course.
[34:14.640 --> 34:16.980]  I mean like, and most of my friends did too.
[34:16.980 --> 34:23.080]  And I was really in seventh when I was in seventh grade, I was still rather scrawny.
[34:23.080 --> 34:26.220]  I was real short and always in very skinny.
[34:26.220 --> 34:31.840]  I didn't have the strength in my pinky fingers to type the, to get the keys to go down far
[34:31.840 --> 34:34.100]  enough to actually print a letter.
[34:34.100 --> 34:39.840]  So like every time I tried to type like an A or a Q or a Z, it would just look like a
[34:39.840 --> 34:43.760]  space, you know, because it would like go down far enough that the typewriter would
[34:43.760 --> 34:45.080]  move one character ahead.
[34:45.080 --> 34:51.080]  But I couldn't, I couldn't strike the key hard enough to actually make the A appear.
[34:51.080 --> 34:56.000]  I can't help but feel that that was actually that, that having, you know, learned to type
[34:56.000 --> 35:01.220]  like that, like was worse for my typing habits because typing on a modern keyboard is nothing
[35:01.220 --> 35:04.440]  at all like typing on a manual keyboard.
[35:04.440 --> 35:05.440]  You know what?
[35:05.440 --> 35:10.800]  I'm sitting here typing, sorry to interrupt, I'm sitting here typing different words on
[35:10.800 --> 35:17.840]  my keyboard and half the time I'm using my left hand to type the Y and half the time
[35:17.840 --> 35:22.280]  I'm using, so if I type the word many, I'm just sitting there trying to think of words
[35:22.280 --> 35:23.280]  with a Y.
[35:23.280 --> 35:27.320]  If I type many, I use my left hand to hit the Y key.
[35:27.320 --> 35:29.320]  I think I do that too.
[35:29.320 --> 35:37.640]  But if I typed out timely, I use the weary now weary I use, I'm just, I'm, it'll make
[35:37.640 --> 35:41.680]  you not use my right hand, Jim, this is how I spent my week.
[35:41.680 --> 35:42.680]  Thanks a lot.
[35:42.680 --> 35:43.760]  Thanks a lot, john.
[35:43.760 --> 35:45.280]  So this is why you want to be on the show.
[35:45.280 --> 35:47.540]  So now I'm going to be tortured for the rest of the week.
[35:47.540 --> 35:51.960]  And once you start figuring out words with why, once you start thinking about your typing,
[35:51.960 --> 35:52.960]  it'll drive you nuts.
[35:52.960 --> 35:57.800]  I've, here's, here's the word that I type, I know for a fact, I type it with my left
[35:57.800 --> 36:04.520]  finger to type the Y like the word you why Oh, you because otherwise, you have to type
[36:04.520 --> 36:07.400]  the whole thing with your right hand and it feels very inefficient.
[36:07.400 --> 36:13.720]  It feels trying to try and type many the word many Yeah, no, I use my right hand for that
[36:13.720 --> 36:14.720]  one.
[36:14.720 --> 36:15.720]  Yeah.
[36:15.720 --> 36:16.720]  Oh, I use my left hand.
[36:16.720 --> 36:17.720]  See?
[36:17.720 --> 36:22.220]  So you can't you can't have this keyboard the way that you want it because then I'd
[36:22.220 --> 36:24.120]  be typing like three wise.
[36:24.120 --> 36:28.680]  Oh, great, now this is going to drive me nuts.
[36:28.680 --> 36:33.800]  I'm going to be thinking every word with a Y so that I can see if I type with my left
[36:33.800 --> 36:34.800]  or my right.
[36:34.800 --> 36:36.000]  I didn't know that I did that.
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.520]  Yeah, clearly what you need to do to the only way that this could possibly be done properly
[36:40.520 --> 36:45.760]  would be to like, set up a camera to videotape you and wait until you haven't, you know,
[36:45.760 --> 36:50.840]  do some, you know, write some posts or to go through some email and wait until you realize,
[36:50.840 --> 36:54.680]  hey, I haven't thought about my typing for the last 10 minutes and then go back and watch
[36:54.680 --> 36:57.400]  the videotape and see see what you actually do.
[36:57.400 --> 37:00.360]  Because when you're thinking about it, you're never going to do it the way you would when
[37:00.360 --> 37:02.280]  you're not thinking about it.
[37:02.280 --> 37:03.280]  Right?
[37:03.280 --> 37:07.280]  No, you're right.
[37:07.280 --> 37:10.360]  I'm gonna keep thinking of words.
[37:10.360 --> 37:16.080]  All right, now I'm gonna have a problem too.
[37:16.080 --> 37:17.080]  We got to move on.
[37:17.080 --> 37:18.080]  We got to move.
[37:18.080 --> 37:19.080]  We can't we're gonna kill people.
[37:19.080 --> 37:23.360]  People are next, you know, we'll be talking baseball.
[37:23.360 --> 37:26.680]  Here's one that was also came up on Twitter today.
[37:26.680 --> 37:29.840]  But I've been thinking about it on and off for weeks now is where the where the hell
[37:29.840 --> 37:32.760]  is airpower?
[37:32.760 --> 37:38.120]  So Apple announced it at the iPhone event in early September last year.
[37:38.120 --> 37:43.280]  And they said it wouldn't, I believe they said won't be till next year.
[37:43.280 --> 37:48.540]  Not like later, but like, specifically, even in September, they said, you know, next year,
[37:48.540 --> 37:52.880]  and now on Twitter, some people have found some, like small print in like their ads,
[37:52.880 --> 37:56.920]  like the little, you know, little tiny small print at the bottom, where they even use the
[37:56.920 --> 37:59.800]  phrase quote, unquote, early 2018.
[37:59.800 --> 38:05.160]  But you know, everybody knows in marketing terms, that means till June 30.
[38:05.160 --> 38:06.160]  Exactly.
[38:06.160 --> 38:10.400]  And you could still say, well, it was the first half of the year.
[38:10.400 --> 38:15.960]  But it this in it's this, you know, like, they've had late products before, right?
[38:15.960 --> 38:21.800]  Like the AirPods didn't really ship in volume until very close to Christmas last year.
[38:21.800 --> 38:22.800]  Yeah, right.
[38:22.800 --> 38:23.800]  And very late.
[38:23.800 --> 38:24.800]  Yeah.
[38:24.800 --> 38:32.640]  And, you know, I obviously, you know, in the same way that in 2016, when they first shipped
[38:32.640 --> 38:42.100]  iPhones that no longer had the analog headphone jack, you know, they do ship lightning headphones
[38:42.100 --> 38:43.100]  with them.
[38:43.100 --> 38:48.520]  Basically, the message was we think AirPods and you know, the W one chip and wireless
[38:48.520 --> 38:53.940]  is the future of headphones, and they were meant to ship together and they didn't.
[38:53.940 --> 38:54.940]  But it wasn't that late.
[38:54.940 --> 38:55.940]  Right?
[38:55.940 --> 38:59.640]  I mean, it was, you know, in a perfect world, I'm sure they would have been shipping in
[38:59.640 --> 39:03.600]  volume when the iPhone seven came out.
[39:03.600 --> 39:08.920]  Two months late, though, understandable, and, you know, two or three months late for a product
[39:08.920 --> 39:13.760]  that's as well received as AirPods are, in hindsight, doesn't really seem like that big
[39:13.760 --> 39:15.840]  of a deal.
[39:15.840 --> 39:20.360]  Whereas AirPower is now like something like two, it's like 220 days ago, like it's already
[39:20.360 --> 39:24.280]  more than half a year since it was announced.
[39:24.280 --> 39:30.080]  And the same way that the AirPods went hand in hand marketing wise with dropping the headphone
[39:30.080 --> 39:35.860]  jack, I think that AirPower goes hand in hand with this year's iPhones being the first ones
[39:35.860 --> 39:38.280]  that charge wirelessly, you know, right.
[39:38.280 --> 39:39.280]  And you can do it.
[39:39.280 --> 39:40.280]  I have a couple of them.
[39:40.280 --> 39:42.040]  I really enjoy it.
[39:42.040 --> 39:47.400]  You know, with these Qi chargers from Mophie and, you know, you know, hundreds of companies,
[39:47.400 --> 39:51.920]  you know, you can't shake a stick in a cell phone store and not hit some of these wireless
[39:51.920 --> 39:54.680]  chargers.
[39:54.680 --> 40:01.160]  But clearly, Apple, you know, meant for you, you know, has something better in mind so
[40:01.160 --> 40:04.480]  that, you know, people who are all in on the Apple lifestyle can have this one pad that
[40:04.480 --> 40:13.040]  charges both their phone and their watch, which ends in the AirPods and the AirPods
[40:13.040 --> 40:16.440]  right with the case that still isn't out yet either.
[40:16.440 --> 40:17.440]  Right.
[40:17.440 --> 40:22.160]  And that's the other that isn't curious thing, too, because the AirPods charging with this
[40:22.160 --> 40:25.240]  was going to require a new case.
[40:25.240 --> 40:28.920]  You know, it looks looks pretty much the same, but there's it's like the charging indicators
[40:28.920 --> 40:35.120]  on the outside, I think, right, instead of having to having to open the lid to see the
[40:35.120 --> 40:37.440]  charging indicator.
[40:37.440 --> 40:44.240]  And when they announced that, I asked if they would be selling that case separately so that
[40:44.240 --> 40:50.320]  people who already own AirPods with the old case, can you get the new case for obviously
[40:50.320 --> 40:56.400]  less than the price of an entire $159 pair of AirPods that you don't need because your
[40:56.400 --> 40:58.600]  two AirPods still work perfectly?
[40:58.600 --> 41:02.240]  And the answer was, alas, that they didn't know yet.
[41:02.240 --> 41:03.880]  Yeah, they're aware of it.
[41:03.880 --> 41:08.480]  They're thinking about it, but they, you know, had nothing to say at the time.
[41:08.480 --> 41:11.800]  But I suspect the answer would be yes.
[41:11.800 --> 41:16.480]  I would hope, but they're still not selling note that if you go into the Apple store today
[41:16.480 --> 41:19.880]  and buy AirPods, you still get the old case.
[41:19.880 --> 41:23.500]  It seems a little weird to me, you would think that they would, you know, even if airpower
[41:23.500 --> 41:27.680]  isn't shipping yet, they they would have switched over to the new case that was airpower ready
[41:27.680 --> 41:28.680]  beforehand.
[41:28.680 --> 41:29.680]  Yeah.
[41:29.680 --> 41:35.200]  But then you'd be able to use them with the other Qi chargers and they probably don't
[41:35.200 --> 41:36.200]  want that right now.
[41:36.200 --> 41:37.200]  Yeah.
[41:37.200 --> 41:38.200]  I don't know if you want to, though.
[41:38.200 --> 41:39.200]  I don't think you will.
[41:39.200 --> 41:45.400]  Like Apple watch doesn't charge with the Qi charger, you know, like airpower is Qi plus
[41:45.400 --> 41:51.000]  Apple secret sauce, you know, as is everything, right?
[41:51.000 --> 41:57.360]  It's you know, Qi plus, I, I, I think that they'll want to release all of this stuff
[41:57.360 --> 41:58.360]  at once.
[41:58.360 --> 41:59.360]  Yeah.
[41:59.360 --> 42:08.760]  You know, that's, I mean, it's different that they, they had the wire was charging
[42:08.760 --> 42:09.760]  for the phone.
[42:09.760 --> 42:10.760]  Yeah.
[42:10.760 --> 42:12.680]  But I think that they kind of needed that.
[42:12.680 --> 42:13.680]  Yeah.
[42:13.680 --> 42:17.200]  I heard last year from somebody like a little birdie at Apple who knew about it, that that
[42:17.200 --> 42:23.200]  was, it was known to be a troubled project, even.
[42:23.200 --> 42:29.840]  I guess that what I heard wasn't before the event it was after, but you know, with the
[42:29.840 --> 42:34.120]  delay, somebody said, yeah, that was, you know, that's been a real problem.
[42:34.120 --> 42:39.760]  Like it was obviously meant to ship in September and it's not even close.
[42:39.760 --> 42:45.720]  Like it's not only did they fail to ship alongside the iPhones, they're 200 and some days later.
[42:45.720 --> 42:49.600]  Will you get an air power?
[42:49.600 --> 42:50.680]  I don't know.
[42:50.680 --> 42:56.360]  I guess because I think I have an Apple watch and I wear it, I don't wear it every day,
[42:56.360 --> 42:58.940]  but I wear it enough.
[42:58.940 --> 43:06.820]  And it, you know, it certainly seems like it would be great for just keeping in my backpack
[43:06.820 --> 43:13.240]  as my travel charger, you know, and then it's just one thing to plug in and I could charge
[43:13.240 --> 43:19.480]  both my Apple watch and I iPhone while traveling and air pods, you know, all three, you know,
[43:19.480 --> 43:22.720]  being able to charge all three while traveling would be great.
[43:22.720 --> 43:28.840]  Like I don't really have a huge need for the all in one now, you know?
[43:28.840 --> 43:35.180]  Well, it's, don't forget that air power is going to be a quicker charge than the ones
[43:35.180 --> 43:36.880]  that are on the market right now too.
[43:36.880 --> 43:37.880]  Yeah.
[43:37.880 --> 43:38.880]  I don't know about that though.
[43:38.880 --> 43:45.420]  Is it, I thought it was like the 7.5 watt ones and that it was quicker than I could
[43:45.420 --> 43:46.420]  be wrong.
[43:46.420 --> 43:52.760]  I think the story was that in September when the iPhones first shipped, iOS was limiting
[43:52.760 --> 43:59.000]  them to like drawing five watts of power and, but that a software update, it was like 11.1
[43:59.000 --> 44:02.040]  or something enabled the 7.5 watt charging.
[44:02.040 --> 44:03.040]  Oh, okay.
[44:03.040 --> 44:04.040]  Maybe.
[44:04.040 --> 44:07.560]  And I don't think air power will do much more than that, if anything.
[44:07.560 --> 44:10.080]  I don't, I don't have a problem with the speed of the ones now though.
[44:10.080 --> 44:14.960]  I mean, it's, it's, I do, well, I mean, I guess I wish it was as fast as lightning,
[44:14.960 --> 44:19.000]  but I, you know, for me it's an overnight thing, so I never really notice.
[44:19.000 --> 44:25.760]  Well, I suppose, but a lot of times I use my, um, I have one of the big chargers, so,
[44:25.760 --> 44:30.160]  you know, I plug it in and it's just zooming right up there with, with the charge.
[44:30.160 --> 44:35.120]  But a lot of that is, you know, you're using your phone all day and you know, for some
[44:35.120 --> 44:41.300]  reason you're using a more than, than normal and it goes down, you have to run to a meeting
[44:41.300 --> 44:43.980]  and you hit, you know, 30%.
[44:43.980 --> 44:48.240]  I want to be able to plug it in like with 30 minutes before I have to go and be done
[44:48.240 --> 44:52.660]  with it, you know, have it, have it charged up.
[44:52.660 --> 44:55.680]  So I use one of those big chargers and that's what it does.
[44:55.680 --> 44:59.640]  So I, it's just very curious to me that this thing is, hasn't shipped yet.
[44:59.640 --> 45:06.040]  I really, you know, just, just seems very unusual and just doesn't seem, and again,
[45:06.040 --> 45:11.040]  I hate, I know the engineers, every engineer I've ever worked with hates when somebody
[45:11.040 --> 45:16.400]  says, you know, like any programmer or engineer and you give them a feature request and say,
[45:16.400 --> 45:19.400]  this should be easy, right?
[45:19.400 --> 45:23.600]  Nobody wants to be told what's, what's easy and what's difficult.
[45:23.600 --> 45:28.120]  And, and I'm sure, and with anything charging related, there's so many safety things, right?
[45:28.120 --> 45:32.680]  Like you, you know, all of these things, you know, you don't, you know, they've got to
[45:32.680 --> 45:36.320]  be a hundred percent reliable, they cannot catch fire or you get too hot and there's
[45:36.320 --> 45:40.200]  all sorts, you know, I'm sure it's not easy.
[45:40.200 --> 45:46.160]  But in the grand scheme of Apple products, it seems like it, it seems like it's not the
[45:46.160 --> 45:48.080]  most difficult product to make.
[45:48.080 --> 45:53.600]  Well, and they, they give those, uh, uh, those engineers at Apple these types of problems
[45:53.600 --> 45:54.880]  all the time.
[45:54.880 --> 45:59.960]  Now with the, with the current chargers that are at the Qi chargers, you basically have
[45:59.960 --> 46:05.240]  to put your phone right in the middle in order to make it work properly.
[46:05.240 --> 46:10.240]  I mean, we've all been through that, that thing where, you know, where if it's not placed
[46:10.240 --> 46:13.160]  properly, then, you know, you have a problem.
[46:13.160 --> 46:15.040]  What do you think they're doing with air power?
[46:15.040 --> 46:21.800]  Because it's, um, you know, more oval shaped and they have, it's bigger, but, but they
[46:21.800 --> 46:26.400]  show three products on air power at once.
[46:26.400 --> 46:31.480]  It's seemingly as, you know, and I did get to look at it in the hands-on area, uh, back
[46:31.480 --> 46:32.480]  in September.
[46:32.480 --> 46:34.800]  It just clearly has a bigger sweet spot.
[46:34.800 --> 46:40.460]  You know, there's a bigger surface area and I don't know why the third party Qi ones tend
[46:40.460 --> 46:42.600]  to have such a small surface area.
[46:42.600 --> 46:44.260]  I don't know.
[46:44.260 --> 46:50.760]  Is air power giving 7.5 to each device or is it 7.5 split?
[46:50.760 --> 46:51.760]  I don't know.
[46:51.760 --> 46:52.760]  That's a good question.
[46:52.760 --> 46:53.760]  I don't know.
[46:53.760 --> 46:54.760]  Right.
[46:54.760 --> 46:58.740]  Does the charging speed get affected if you have multiple devices on at once?
[46:58.740 --> 47:03.040]  I would guess no, I would think no, but I don't know.
[47:03.040 --> 47:08.480]  I mean, what's the max charge power.
[47:08.480 --> 47:13.760]  I did terribly in my electrical engineering course in freshman year.
[47:13.760 --> 47:14.760]  Really really bad.
[47:14.760 --> 47:18.880]  I had to, I had to switch majors through geez.
[47:18.880 --> 47:19.880]  So I don't know.
[47:19.880 --> 47:20.880]  You might be asking the wrong person.
[47:20.880 --> 47:21.880]  I don't know.
[47:21.880 --> 47:23.480]  I just find it very, very curious.
[47:23.480 --> 47:31.160]  Uh, yeah, I don't, I, well, you know, I think part of it too is that Apple has started shipping
[47:31.160 --> 47:37.320]  more products late and, or preannounced than they used to traditionally.
[47:37.320 --> 47:38.320]  Oh yeah.
[47:38.320 --> 47:39.320]  Right.
[47:39.320 --> 47:44.480]  And that I feel like we've sort of gotten a little numb to it.
[47:44.480 --> 47:45.480]  Right.
[47:45.480 --> 47:49.800]  It's, it's no longer as surprising as when they first started doing that.
[47:49.800 --> 47:54.200]  Um, and so like, you know, Oh, of course AirPods are a couple months late, right?
[47:54.200 --> 47:55.680]  If that wasn't shocking.
[47:55.680 --> 47:56.680]  Right.
[47:56.680 --> 47:59.480]  And they, you know, they kind of set the stage for that at the time.
[47:59.480 --> 48:07.480]  Cause if, if you recall, they did give us review units of AirPods in September, but
[48:07.480 --> 48:11.600]  they were very, very adamant that they were prototypes.
[48:11.600 --> 48:15.700]  And when the production one started shipping, they wanted, they wanted those prototypes
[48:15.700 --> 48:22.480]  back that day, like three months later, uh, they were like, here's a, you know, here's
[48:22.480 --> 48:23.640]  a FedEx thing.
[48:23.640 --> 48:26.240]  We expect this tomorrow.
[48:26.240 --> 48:29.360]  And I do remember too, I remember, I think it was even overnight.
[48:29.360 --> 48:37.040]  And, and they never take, you know, they, you know, the, the, when you, when you send
[48:37.040 --> 48:40.440]  back review products from Apple, they are very chill.
[48:40.440 --> 48:46.320]  They're very laid back about them and they do supply you with, uh, like FedEx labels
[48:46.320 --> 48:50.640]  so that, you know, it's all postage paid, but it's not typically next day cause they
[48:50.640 --> 48:51.640]  don't care.
[48:51.640 --> 48:52.640]  They don't care if it takes a week.
[48:52.640 --> 48:53.640]  Right.
[48:53.640 --> 48:57.280]  They're, you know, just send back this, you know, iPad eventually and you send it back
[48:57.280 --> 48:59.680]  and you know, it takes a week to get there, whatever.
[48:59.680 --> 49:02.320]  But they, they wanted those AirPods prototypes.
[49:02.320 --> 49:08.440]  And even though I couldn't see one damn thing that was different between them.
[49:08.440 --> 49:09.640]  Me neither.
[49:09.640 --> 49:13.160]  And you know, those prototypes, uh, worked so well for me.
[49:13.160 --> 49:14.160]  Yeah.
[49:14.160 --> 49:15.160]  I have no idea.
[49:15.160 --> 49:16.160]  Yeah.
[49:16.160 --> 49:17.160]  I don't know what.
[49:17.160 --> 49:21.900]  And, but sort of the new ones or your, you know, the shipping version, the shipping versions
[49:21.900 --> 49:23.600]  works well too.
[49:23.600 --> 49:26.200]  That's one of my favorite Apple products.
[49:26.200 --> 49:28.480]  I have them in my pocket all the time.
[49:28.480 --> 49:29.480]  Yeah.
[49:29.480 --> 49:30.480]  No, same here.
[49:30.480 --> 49:31.480]  Without question.
[49:31.480 --> 49:33.480]  I'm always shocked when they're not in my pocket.
[49:33.480 --> 49:34.480]  I'm like, Oh my God.
[49:34.480 --> 49:35.480]  Yeah.
[49:35.480 --> 49:37.480]  Well, where are they?
[49:37.480 --> 49:39.100]  Um, right.
[49:39.100 --> 49:42.860]  I used to put a little sticker on mine to tell them apart from Amy's so we'd never
[49:42.860 --> 49:44.040]  get them confused.
[49:44.040 --> 49:47.000]  And then the sticker would sometimes, you know, fall off over time.
[49:47.000 --> 49:52.560]  Uh, you know, cause I didn't want to put like a super sticky, sticky sticker there.
[49:52.560 --> 49:54.600]  Uh, and then I realized there's no need for it.
[49:54.600 --> 49:58.720]  Like I just, we're 99% of the time there's no confusion over who's air pods or who's
[49:58.720 --> 50:01.680]  because they're always in my pocket.
[50:01.680 --> 50:02.680]  Yeah.
[50:02.680 --> 50:06.200]  Um, and that's, that's where they're going to stake.
[50:06.200 --> 50:10.840]  I use them pretty much every day.
[50:10.840 --> 50:13.080]  I do.
[50:13.080 --> 50:14.080]  And I love them.
[50:14.080 --> 50:15.080]  Yeah.
[50:15.080 --> 50:16.080]  It's a great product.
[50:16.080 --> 50:20.400]  Um, I guess it would be better to have it on a charging that I guess I've, I would,
[50:20.400 --> 50:23.760]  if air power works, we don't even know what it's going to cost.
[50:23.760 --> 50:27.360]  And it's probably, it's probably going to be surprisingly expensive compared to these
[50:27.360 --> 50:28.360]  key chargers.
[50:28.360 --> 50:33.880]  Uh, uh, yeah, I guess I would like to put one on my desk though.
[50:33.880 --> 50:40.040]  Now that I think about it, I do have a little cheap charger on my desk, uh, an anchor one,
[50:40.040 --> 50:41.200]  but it's nice.
[50:41.200 --> 50:45.040]  It's like a stand it like, it almost like props the iPhone up and I can use it to like
[50:45.040 --> 50:47.320]  see alerts and stuff like that.
[50:47.320 --> 50:51.720]  It's nice to just have these things laying about and in a way that lightning cables always
[50:51.720 --> 50:57.600]  felt like, you know, like if let's say your phone is at like 85%, mostly full, uh, I'm
[50:57.600 --> 51:00.720]  not going to plug it into a lightning cable if I'm going to be at my desk for half an
[51:00.720 --> 51:02.520]  hour, you know, I'll just keep it in my pocket.
[51:02.520 --> 51:04.440]  But I, but I will use a T charger that way.
[51:04.440 --> 51:09.880]  I'll just take it out and just, why not just let the phone sit on it while I'm working.
[51:09.880 --> 51:16.440]  You know, the, the interesting thing about that is, and I talked to them about this because
[51:16.440 --> 51:20.960]  before you were supposed to let your battery run all the way down.
[51:20.960 --> 51:28.600]  You know, weren't supposed to plug it, plugging it in because that would, uh, ruin the battery.
[51:28.600 --> 51:34.320]  And I asked them if that wasn't a problem anymore.
[51:34.320 --> 51:40.000]  And they just reiterated that you could use the, the charger whenever you want it.
[51:40.000 --> 51:41.000]  Yeah.
[51:41.000 --> 51:42.000]  I asked about that too.
[51:42.000 --> 51:45.920]  Um, and they were adamant about, I guess that's a pretty good question.
[51:45.920 --> 51:50.540]  I get asked that on Twitter a lot too is, is it a bad idea to, you know, to keep your
[51:50.540 --> 51:54.840]  phone, you know, if you have like a T charger at your desk at work and stuff like that and
[51:54.840 --> 51:58.400]  you have one in your car, you know, you get in your car in the morning and drive to work
[51:58.400 --> 52:02.480]  and your phone goes from, you know, it's already at 98 now it's back up to a hundred.
[52:02.480 --> 52:06.280]  You get to work, you put it on your desk at work and it's, you know, never drops below
[52:06.280 --> 52:08.300]  the nineties or something like that.
[52:08.300 --> 52:09.400]  Is that bad for the phone?
[52:09.400 --> 52:13.480]  And I was told definitely no, you know, that you just use it whenever you want.
[52:13.480 --> 52:17.640]  If you want to run it down to, it's in the red and then charge it back up.
[52:17.640 --> 52:23.820]  And if you keep it, you know, above 80% all day, the phone manages all of that.
[52:23.820 --> 52:28.960]  Like the phone won't let itself, the iPhone is programmed, I guess it's a mix of hardware
[52:28.960 --> 52:34.600]  and software, but it's by design will never do anything that would harm the battery life
[52:34.600 --> 52:40.360]  adverse, you know, more than the, the way that it can't help but degrade over time.
[52:40.360 --> 52:45.860]  Well, and you remember those days though, when, when they said, oh, don't, don't keep
[52:45.860 --> 52:51.080]  plugging it in, if it's at, you know, 90% let it go down to almost empty and then plug
[52:51.080 --> 52:52.080]  it in.
[52:52.080 --> 52:55.660]  And that's how we, we lived with this stuff for, for years.
[52:55.660 --> 52:58.920]  I had a power book and it's not even that long ago.
[52:58.920 --> 53:04.760]  It was, it was probably around 2006 or so.
[53:04.760 --> 53:12.300]  And it's funny cause I say I would never do it now, but at the time I was using it
[53:12.300 --> 53:18.720]  as a desktop only device.
[53:18.720 --> 53:23.460]  And I, it was literally, I never unplugged it.
[53:23.460 --> 53:25.520]  Like I had external hard drives and stuff like that.
[53:25.520 --> 53:33.180]  And I, I had like an old iBook that I used when I actually wanted to travel with a laptop.
[53:33.180 --> 53:37.360]  And what wound up happening to that power book is the battery, cause it never used the
[53:37.360 --> 53:38.360]  battery.
[53:38.360 --> 53:39.820]  It was at a hundred percent for months at a time.
[53:39.820 --> 53:43.360]  And then the battery, I got like a warning one day, like, Hey, your battery's, you know,
[53:43.360 --> 53:45.160]  battery's dead.
[53:45.160 --> 53:46.160]  And it was like, what?
[53:46.160 --> 53:47.860]  And it was like, the battery wouldn't hold a charge at all.
[53:47.860 --> 53:51.400]  And you know, lo and behold, there was like a tech note that, Hey, you're, you know, you're
[53:51.400 --> 53:55.500]  supposed to let the battery run down every couple of weeks, just, just to keep it healthy.
[53:55.500 --> 53:59.160]  And I hadn't, and then the battery was like wrecked.
[53:59.160 --> 54:00.400]  Yeah.
[54:00.400 --> 54:02.800]  And it, it appears that doesn't happen anymore.
[54:02.800 --> 54:05.440]  I wonder if it still does, if you keep it plugged in.
[54:05.440 --> 54:08.220]  But that was, that was a machine where I could buy a new battery.
[54:08.220 --> 54:09.220]  Remember when they, you know?
[54:09.220 --> 54:10.220]  Yes.
[54:10.220 --> 54:11.220]  Yes.
[54:11.220 --> 54:17.900]  Boy, that, it feels, it feels like we're, we're far into the future now that it seems
[54:17.900 --> 54:22.100]  old fashioned that you could pop the battery out of your laptop.
[54:22.100 --> 54:33.240]  I know, but to be honest, the battery in today's MacBook Pros or MacBooks would last longer
[54:33.240 --> 54:37.240]  than, you know, a couple of batteries from back then.
[54:37.240 --> 54:38.240]  Oh, definitely.
[54:38.240 --> 54:43.160]  There's, there's no comparison, you know, back in that era, it was tough to get it,
[54:43.160 --> 54:48.520]  you know, even four and a half hours on a flight with reasonable, you know, a reasonable
[54:48.520 --> 54:49.920]  screen brightness.
[54:49.920 --> 54:56.720]  Well, I re I remember packing, you know, a backpack to go on a, a trip or go to an Apple
[54:56.720 --> 54:59.760]  event or fly out to Mac world or whatever.
[54:59.760 --> 55:05.800]  And you know, have a couple of spare batteries have, you know, and then the 15 pound computer
[55:05.800 --> 55:11.720]  and he had old backpack full of equipment just to, to go on a trip.
[55:11.720 --> 55:18.680]  Now you can just go with, you know, a power cord and, and a Mac book or an iPad.
[55:18.680 --> 55:23.480]  Hey, let me hear something while we're talking about batteries and I wanted, I, I didn't
[55:23.480 --> 55:27.120]  put it in the notes, but I wanted to ask you, I, I've been wearing my Apple watch more than
[55:27.120 --> 55:31.880]  I had been for a while recently, you know, I had to switch around between different watches
[55:31.880 --> 55:38.040]  and I just realized with the series three Apple watch, which has much better battery
[55:38.040 --> 55:45.040]  life than before I run out of battery on my, on, or get the warning on my Apple watch more
[55:45.040 --> 55:49.360]  than I used to because I can, I can go days without charging it.
[55:49.360 --> 55:54.800]  Like I'll go to sleep wearing instead of charging it religiously as I go to bed, I'll just wear
[55:54.800 --> 55:55.800]  it in bed.
[55:55.800 --> 56:00.880]  It's a, it's a, cause it's my favorite watch to wear while I sleep because I can see it
[56:00.880 --> 56:01.880]  in the dark.
[56:01.880 --> 56:04.760]  Um, it's, you know, if I wake up in the middle of the night and want to know what time it
[56:04.760 --> 56:12.760]  is, um, and, but therefore I, I, now that I've broken the habit of every night I have
[56:12.760 --> 56:16.200]  to charge the Apple watch or it won't make it through the next day.
[56:16.200 --> 56:23.340]  Uh, now I actually end up running out of battery more often because I can go like three days.
[56:23.340 --> 56:29.240]  Like I pretty sure I'm on my third day right now and I've still got 42% battery life.
[56:29.240 --> 56:30.960]  That's pretty good.
[56:30.960 --> 56:32.960]  Have you seen it?
[56:32.960 --> 56:38.740]  I have one of these, uh, chargers, um, you know, that's, uh, it sits down in the middle
[56:38.740 --> 56:44.600]  pops through, you know, the Apple watch charger and the middle pops up and I have that facing,
[56:44.600 --> 56:47.220]  uh, on my nightstand.
[56:47.220 --> 56:53.800]  So every night the last thing I do is put my Apple watch on that when I go to bed and
[56:53.800 --> 56:57.480]  when I wake up in the morning, you still have the daily charging habit.
[56:57.480 --> 57:00.320]  I still have that habit and that's, that's all it is right now.
[57:00.320 --> 57:05.200]  Now if there's a situation, um, you know, I have gone away for the weekend and forgotten
[57:05.200 --> 57:09.360]  the charger and the Apple watches lasted the entire week.
[57:09.360 --> 57:17.580]  Have you, that's not a big, what's your battery life at right now on the watch and good question.
[57:17.580 --> 57:18.580]  Just flick up.
[57:18.580 --> 57:19.580]  I did.
[57:19.580 --> 57:26.560]  I did flick out 81% see that 81% that's and we're recording here at a two 30 Pacific time.
[57:26.560 --> 57:31.040]  It's, it's, it's really kind of remarkable how quickly battery life has gotten better
[57:31.040 --> 57:35.880]  on Apple watch with the device only getting like, it's like one 10th of a millimeter thicker
[57:35.880 --> 57:41.480]  or something like that since the original, um, like, you know, we're sitting here talking
[57:41.480 --> 57:45.560]  about power books from 10 years ago having dramatically different battery life, but the
[57:45.560 --> 57:50.380]  Apple watch, it's just in the course of like two and a half years, it was crazy how much
[57:50.380 --> 57:52.680]  better the battery got.
[57:52.680 --> 57:58.280]  Well, and to be clear, I use my Apple watch a lot throughout the day.
[57:58.280 --> 58:04.500]  Um, whenever I use navigation and I use navigation even when I don't need to use navigation cause
[58:04.500 --> 58:06.420]  I test out different apps.
[58:06.420 --> 58:12.440]  So I'll use Google and ways and Apple, mostly those three just to see what they do.
[58:12.440 --> 58:18.000]  So my watch, when I use Apple watch, it's, you know, um, doing the haptics to tell me
[58:18.000 --> 58:19.640]  the term and stuff like that.
[58:19.640 --> 58:21.080]  Um, I talked to it.
[58:21.080 --> 58:24.440]  I ask it, you know, hockey scores and things like that.
[58:24.440 --> 58:28.920]  Um, and it's, I have news coming up on it all the time.
[58:28.920 --> 58:36.560]  So my watch is being used and still I can go, you know, two or three days on a single
[58:36.560 --> 58:37.560]  chart.
[58:37.560 --> 58:39.080]  Do you have a cellular?
[58:39.080 --> 58:40.080]  Yes.
[58:40.080 --> 58:44.920]  Do you, how often do you find yourself using that?
[58:44.920 --> 58:45.920]  Almost never.
[58:45.920 --> 58:46.920]  Yeah.
[58:46.920 --> 58:47.920]  Same here.
[58:47.920 --> 58:48.920]  I have it.
[58:48.920 --> 58:49.920]  I pay for it.
[58:49.920 --> 58:51.720]  It's like 10 bucks a month, but who knows?
[58:51.720 --> 58:58.320]  Verizon's probably somehow, um, well, they give you like a courtesy charge.
[58:58.320 --> 58:59.320]  You know what I mean?
[58:59.320 --> 59:02.760]  And they always, they always give it a name like that, like a courtesy charge.
[59:02.760 --> 59:03.760]  Yeah.
[59:03.760 --> 59:04.760]  Yeah.
[59:04.760 --> 59:06.240]  I don't even know what that is.
[59:06.240 --> 59:10.120]  Well, it's, you know, it's just the, you know, they just have the courtesy to charge you
[59:10.120 --> 59:17.820]  an extra dollar, dollar a month, just as a F you, uh, like I have to have so much more
[59:17.820 --> 59:20.760]  respect for them if they would just charge it like a fuck you fee.
[59:20.760 --> 59:21.760]  You know what I mean?
[59:21.760 --> 59:25.080]  Like I was, I told you a couple of weeks ago about buying movie tickets with my son and
[59:25.080 --> 59:31.360]  I noticed that in a Fandango app, like, I don't know, let's just say like $11 a seat
[59:31.360 --> 59:36.360]  and the, it came to, you know, $22 for two seats plus tax.
[59:36.360 --> 59:41.120]  And I believe they Fandango called it a courtesy fee.
[59:41.120 --> 59:45.360]  I would have so much more respect for them if they just said, screw you fee because we
[59:45.360 --> 59:55.680]  can't, because we can fee, we know you're going to pay it anyway fee.
[59:55.680 --> 59:58.880]  And there you go, John, pay it.
[59:58.880 --> 59:59.880]  I do wonder about that.
[59:59.880 --> 01:00:06.680]  I have the, uh, I also think about the, um, uh, with the Apple watch charger, with the,
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:12.120]  the air power thing, um, before we move on to another topic, uh, sometimes I wear the
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:16.000]  link bracelet and with the link bracelet, you'd have to kind of like take it apart to
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.220]  get it on that charger.
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:21.020]  Like I need the, the pop-up charger that you're talking about where you can put the watch
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:26.200]  on its side to, to charge it with the, with the link bracelet.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.440]  Yep.
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:35.640]  And it does act as a, you know, if you put it in, what's that mode called where at night,
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:40.040]  if you tap it alarm clock mode or something alarm clock mode or whatever.
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.040]  Yeah.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:47.200]  And I've used that, especially when I've been on trips, uh, because I also wake up and want
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.200]  to know what time it is.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:54.280]  So I'll just reach over and just tap the watch and it comes up and shows me the time and
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:56.540]  you know, that's, it's all good.
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:01:01.480]  But that, that charger stand, uh, that Apple sells for the Apple watch best thing I've
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:02.480]  had for the Apple watch.
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.480]  Oh, I love it too.
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:04.480]  It's wonderful.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:09.280]  That's why I'm a little, it's why I'm a little iffy on whether I really even need air power
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:14.720]  or if I do, I met, like I said, maybe I'd only take it as a traveling thing because
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:15.720]  I liked that.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:21.920]  I have that Apple charger and I like it and it doesn't really, uh, it doesn't really bother
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:26.960]  me or inconvenience me or clutter up my bedroom to have both that and a T charger.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:27.960]  Right.
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:35.360]  And you know, I'll still get an air power, uh, because if I can, I maybe once a week
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:43.060]  I'll charge up my, uh, my AirPods, uh, through, you know, um, lightning, but to have that
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:46.320]  and the phone just walk in and put them down and they're charging.
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.320]  Yeah.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.320]  I'll get that.
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:49.320]  I guess I will too.
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:50.320]  Who are we kidding?
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:59.440]  Says me, the guy who just blew $270 on keyboards that he doesn't need, that he doesn't need.
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:00.440]  Yeah.
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:04.240]  I guess I'll buy an air power.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:07.720]  I will say this while we were skipping around on all three of these products, but I'll say
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:14.280]  this also with the AirPods, uh, I am still on my original AirPods from December of, I
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:22.440]  guess that was 2016 I still, I never ever run out of battery life on these things.
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:23.440]  I have never won.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:26.520]  I don't even heard the noise one time.
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:27.520]  There's like a little noise.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:30.920]  It plays when it's like a warning and I didn't know what it was cause I'd had them for so
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:35.140]  long and, and, or maybe I heard it while I was testing them, you know, like as they were
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:38.360]  new, I like purposefully didn't charge them.
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.820]  Uh, I never run out of battery.
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:46.500]  And what happens is I, I think, Hey, I haven't charged these things in, I don't even remember
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.560]  when I last charged it.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:51.280]  I bet that they're like almost out of battery and then I'll hold it up to my phone and it'll
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.880]  still be like the cases at 40% and the buds are fully charged.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:03:00.560]  And I think, well, I'll quick plug it in, I guess, you know, every, every once a week,
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:04.640]  maybe I plugged the thing in to a lightning cable for a couple of minutes, but it's, it
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:11.200]  is the, it is the best battery life for any product I've ever had in my life.
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:14.240]  So here's a little story for you.
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:22.200]  I went to, um, I was about a four, four and a half hour flight a couple months ago and
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:28.360]  I got to the airport and I had my iPad and I downloaded a whole bunch of shows from Netflix
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:34.320]  to watch, and I got there early and started watching Netflix.
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:41.240]  I have my AirPods and started watching Netflix, uh, at the gate and get on the plane.
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:44.480]  And I heard that sound that they make when they're running out of battery, you know,
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:50.440]  a few hours in and sure enough, they were, they were both dead.
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.440]  I plugged them.
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.480]  I dropped them in the case.
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:04:01.200]  Um, 15 minutes later, they were fully charged and kept watching the show.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:09.040]  So I had a 15 minute break of watching shows and that fully charged my AirPods that it's
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:15.920]  absolutely stunning, but they, they still lasted like four hours for anything that I'm
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:22.400]  concerned about losing keys, sunglasses, you know, obviously AirPods add to the mix.
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.800]  I tend to, I have terrible memory for stuff like that.
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:30.680]  Like, so I can't just like put my sunglasses anywhere and then expect to remember where
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:31.680]  they are.
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:35.480]  So I just, you know, the way I've managed it my whole life is I'll just have certain
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.480]  rules.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:39.440]  Like you only ever put your sunglasses X, Y, and Z.
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.640]  Like there's a spot where they live.
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:46.040]  They're either in that spot in my office actually where, where they live.
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:53.280]  Um, they're in a coat pocket or they are in the car and that's it.
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.280]  Or they're on my face.
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:55.280]  Right.
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:05:01.360]  Uh, and I do the same thing with my keys and, and if, if my keys aren't at the spot where
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:06.800]  I keep my keys, I'm screwed because if, if they're not in my pocket or on the spot where
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:11.960]  I keep my keys, I might, I, you know, every time it happens, I fear that I'm going to
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:25.320]  have to change the locks in the house, you know, because, but with air power, my, uh,
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:32.480]  air power with the, the air pods, my rule is, uh, on my desk and that's the only place
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:38.480]  where I typically charge him, uh, on the kitchen counter where there's a lightning cable or
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:39.480]  in my pocket.
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:40.480]  And that's it.
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:46.560]  Um, and with the buds themselves, my rule is, uh, other than when I like go jogging,
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:52.320]  when I would just take the buds, if I'm using my air pods, I have the case in my pocket
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:56.560]  and if I take them out of my ear and I need to put them anywhere, if I'm not just going
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:00.480]  to hold them, you know, like while I'm paying or talking to somebody or something, if I'm
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:03.240]  not my hand, then I put them back in the case, right?
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:07.960]  Like I'll never just throw the pods, the buds loose in my pocket.
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:14.760]  Um, but by having that habit, it's like they, they, they even like on an airplane flight
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:20.260]  or something like that, they, uh, they take, you know, they, they get enough of a charge
[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:22.840]  that they never drop.
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:32.600]  If my, my air pods are always in my case and they're always in my pocket, the only other
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:35.520]  place they are is charging.
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:40.680]  So there is no other place that there'll be pocket or charging.
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:45.760]  And when they're charging, I noticed that they're not in my pocket cause I, I guess
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:48.840]  I just got used to feeling them there.
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:51.840]  So then I take it back.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:55.420]  Um, I don't like flying with them because they're not noise canceling.
[01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:59.960]  So I have like a pair of Bose noise canceling wireless headphones that I bought like six
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:05.400]  months ago, uh, which I really like, uh, um,
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:09.920]  But I have flown with them because I've either forgotten my other headphones or, uh, I flew
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:13.640]  with, I've flown with them before I bought these Bose quiet comfort, whatever the hell
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:14.640]  they're called.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:20.920]  Um, but when I get up to pee on an airplane, if I'm wearing my air pods, I take them out
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:30.920]  because if the, you know, the idea of dropping one in that filthy airplane bathroom, let
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:36.120]  alone if it actually went into the toilet, but any, I, if my air pod fell out of my ear
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:39.580]  and they never fall out of my ear, they don't fall out of my ear.
[01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:40.760]  It's not a problem.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:46.040]  But the idea that the one time they might fall out and they would touch any surface
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:51.160]  in the airplane bathroom, I would, I would have to throw them out.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:58.560]  I mean, that's so, but just the nature of just putting them in the case for the 90 seconds
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:03.720]  it takes to get up and, and go to the restroom in the airline means that you'd land on a
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:06.640]  cross country flight and they're still charged, you know?
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:07.960]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:08.960]  Yeah.
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:09.960]  It's a great problem.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:14.840]  You get off the plane, you, you know, you still have them in and you're still listening
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.440]  to music and you know, it's, it's wonderful.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:19.400]  I just love them.
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:20.880]  It's my favorite product right now.
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:21.880]  All right.
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:23.480]  Let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:24.720]  I'm very excited about this.
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:29.720]  This is a first time sponsor of the show and I think it is a fantastic idea for a podcast
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:31.360]  sponsorship.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:33.280]  Not that there's anything wrong with advertising a podcast.
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:37.600]  I actually think that that was a great sponsorship too, because you know who listens to podcasts,
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:42.980]  people who listen to podcasts, all right, let's talk music.
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:47.600]  You spend countless days, maybe weeks for, let's say you're working on a video project,
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:51.040]  maybe a promotional thing for an app or a service that you're working on and you spend
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:55.840]  weeks searching through stock music libraries because you know that the right song could
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.320]  take your make your make or break your video, right?
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:02.980]  If cool video, but you have cool music on it with the right vibe, then it works.
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:06.040]  And if you have terrible music on it, it could wreck the whole thing.
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:12.600]  Well, haven't you noticed that in most libraries that of stock music, they sound like stock
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.600]  music.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.600]  I think this is true.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:18.480]  I noticed that every time I watch like a youtube video and I can tell when they're using stock
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:22.800]  music, it's exactly bad stock music is like bad stock photography.
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.220]  It just has a look to it.
[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:27.560]  Like you just know you're looking at a stock photo when you know when you're listening
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:29.000]  to stock music.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  Well, here's the alternative.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:40.480]  Alex Weinstein music.
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:44.920]  Now this is a carefully curated collection of just a few hundred songs, not thousands
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:48.640]  and thousands of songs, which just makes it worse because you've got to dig through them.
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:54.240]  Just a few hundred songs all from one composer, Alex Weinstein, and that's available for you
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:55.240]  to license.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:59.040]  Alex has a unique, organic and handmade style.
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.940]  You're listening to it right now.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:08.720]  As I speak to his music has been used in commercials by Amazon, Starbucks, eBay, Disney and others.
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:12.920]  One password Wealthfront established brands and startups alike all trust this composer
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:16.920]  and the library is a joy to use it as an elegant and intuitive search engine.
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:21.820]  You can preview tracks without irritating audio watermarks and when you find something
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:25.800]  that works, you can purchase a license right in the browser and instantly download the
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:26.800]  files.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:30.120]  Also, every song can be edited for your needs, so if you love a track but you don't like
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:34.800]  the banjo or something, you can contact Alex and his staff and they'll take it out and
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:39.740]  get you a custom cut of the song and they'll do this free of charge to edit the song so
[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:41.920]  it fits perfectly and they'll do it free of charge.
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:47.040]  As a special offer to talk show listeners use the coupon code the talk show at checkout
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:53.400]  for 25% off your first license so you can save 25% on your first license just by using

[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:15.680]  So the cool part and this ties into the opening of the show is Alex Weinstein happens to be
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:18.280]  a longtime fan of the show.
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:22.760]  Hi Alex, thanks for thanks for sponsoring.
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:28.920]  And was the composer along with Adam Lisa Gore of the Picking Boogers with John theme
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:30.860]  song.
[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:31.860]  Very different style.
[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:34.600]  That's a little bit over the top, obviously.
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:40.280]  But I really enjoy that the callback to like what like a five or six year old gag on the
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:43.480]  show now here he is sponsoring the show.
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:45.460]  Can't recommend his music more.
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:46.460]  It's so great.
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:48.080]  I sent you a pic.
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:53.400]  It was, you know, just sounds great doesn't it very distinctive and just doesn't have
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.800]  that awful stock.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:12:00.200]  You know, I spent 15 seconds in GarageBand sound to it.
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:07.440]  Right and I'll agree and and I listened to it with headphones on and it's got a great
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:10.400]  feel on the headphones great sound.
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:13.080]  Yeah, it's like she's like, you know, this is serious stuff.
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:17.840]  This is like, you know, as high a production as high production can get.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:23.680]  See, John, if you want, I'll write a song for you be a bit more metal and I would like
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:24.680]  that.
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:25.680]  I bet you could do a killer.
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:33.720]  You could probably do a killer version of Picking Boogers with John.
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:36.520]  I might have to give that if you do that, we'll stick it in it.
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:39.080]  We'll stick it on at the end of the show.
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:49.320]  Do you see this story last week about this guy with a damaged iMac Pro is a YouTuber
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:56.720]  named I think it's Lucas Linus Sebastian very successful YouTuber very popular YouTube channel.
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:59.120]  Do you see this story?
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.260]  I did.
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:06.400]  So I think that this is a fair summary of it that he and his colleagues at his YouTube
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:13.320]  channel got an iMac Pro to do a review of and they did a tear down of it.
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:21.620]  They took it apart to show the internals sort of I guess like I fix it style and not as
[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:26.240]  good in the course of putting it back together.
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:36.260]  They damaged the screen and oh, by the way, also the logic board and something else.
[01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:43.240]  Then when they took it to get repaired, to be clear, it's a new device but they obviously
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:47.520]  realized that what they had done to it was not going to be covered by warranty coverage.
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:52.600]  So what they wanted is they wanted to give it to Apple, have it repaired and pay.
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:59.160]  Tell us what it will cost and they will pay to have this fixed.
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:06.640]  And ultimately Apple turned them down because of the way that you guys have opened this
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:10.920]  up that we don't want this.
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:17.040]  You can't even pay us to repair this thing.
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:24.120]  So far, to me, it would be nice if Apple would fix it but I kind of think a reasonable person
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:29.380]  given what's going on here can see why maybe they wouldn't.
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:35.640]  But then they made this YouTube video that I think rather disingenuously made it seem
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:44.560]  as though they didn't emphasize the we took this thing apart and wrecked the internals
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.560]  aspect of it.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:50.820]  And it was more we had a whoopsie with our iMac Pro and guess what, Apple doesn't have
[01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:54.640]  any certified technicians who can fix iMac Pros.
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:59.600]  And it's like what you're spending $6,000 on a on a pro computer and Apple doesn't even
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:01.320]  know how to fix it.
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:06.800]  And that's the story that like spread like wildfire that you could buy a $6,000 computer
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:11.000]  from Apple and they don't know how to fix it if it goes bad.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:19.240]  Well it was interesting because the morning that this before it all blew up, Dave Mark
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:22.920]  sent me a link to the video and said, What do you think about this?
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.920]  Should we post it?
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.800]  And I, I watched it.
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:33.160]  And as soon as he started, I texted Dave back and said, Don't post it.
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:35.620]  There's something funky going on here.
[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:37.320]  This is not what it seems.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.880]  Yeah, Renee had a good video about it.
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:40.880]  Yeah.
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:43.800]  And we didn't post it.
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:46.560]  But we did post I think one of the follow ups.
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:50.880]  Because as it turns out, there was something more.
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:55.560]  But to be honest, if I was Apple, I wouldn't touch it.
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:57.720]  I wouldn't have touched it at all.
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:01.880]  Because as soon as you fix it and send it back to him, if anything else goes wrong,
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:03.800]  then it's still under warranty, right?
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:05.840]  No way am I touching that.
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:10.900]  If you look, I think you had the best line.
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:15.060]  In car terms, Apple is saying his iMac is totaled, right?
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:17.080]  And that's exactly right.
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:18.540]  The car is totaled.
[01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:21.400]  The insurance company doesn't want to have anything to do with it.
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.920]  Nobody's going to fix it for you.
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:23.920]  It's done.
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.680]  Because nobody wants to take that responsibility.
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:27.680]  Yeah.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:31.760]  And somebody said, I agree with them, with the electrical problems that it was having
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:36.280]  having that you could really understand, you know, and, you know, Apple's certified techs
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:40.960]  are professional, and I'm sure they, you know, know how to ground themselves and do everything
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:43.300]  right when working with these things.
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:48.200]  But if it's already damaged, I could see why they don't want to risk having somebody go
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:51.800]  in there and, you know, possibly get electrocuted or something.
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:52.920]  I don't know.
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:56.720]  And I also wonder if part of itI feel like the only thing Apple's done wrong here is
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:01.200]  not communicate clearly to the guy like, hey, we're sorry, but it's totaled.
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:05.280]  You know, because if your car is totaled, if you're in a car accident, and you're like,
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:10.880]  you don't know if it's going to be repairable or not, you know, and the mechanic will just
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:12.600]  tell you, you know, this is totaled, right?
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.640]  I guess you have to work it out with your insurance company.
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:17.600]  But they'll just say, you know, well, we're not going to, you know, we'll just give you
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:20.280]  the money because this isn't worth it to fix it.
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:24.680]  Yeah, but let's be honest, we don't know what Apple communicated to him.
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:25.680]  No, we don't.
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:28.960]  And I don't take I don't believe I don't believe his word on what they said to him.
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:33.640]  I know exactly quotes from some emails where people are, you know, that people are confused,
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:37.360]  but it doesn't seem like they're informed about it.
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:42.480]  Apple could have very easily send him a thing, and he's just trying to put pressure on them
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:45.800]  and, you know, obviously, people picked it up.
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:52.440]  But Apple could have sent him a note and said, Look, there's no way that we're going to touch
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:57.400]  this because you're a moron and you wreck the computer, and we're not going to be responsible
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.400]  for it.
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:17:59.400]  Right?
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.580]  Like, I'm sure they know how much a display costs.
[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:06.640]  Like if you if the only problem is that the display was cracked.
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:12.760]  I'm sure Apple can just quote you the, you know, it'll cost, I don't know, probably $8,
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:17.480]  $900 to get a new display or whatever it costs.
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:23.040]  But they also have to like test everything else, right, you know, to see if there's any
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:27.720]  if there are any other problems, so they can't just as you drop it off at the Genius Bar,
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:33.840]  they can't guarantee I don't think at least that's my experience like my son dropped his
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:40.560]  MacBook Pro, like around it was over the holidays, like back in Christmas, and he's usually very
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:45.480]  careful with his devices and he has a, you know, years long track record of, you know,
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:50.200]  keeping every, you know, really, really, really good with his devices.
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:52.120]  You know, accidents happen.
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:57.240]  So you know, it wasn't in any trouble, but when we took it to get it, you know, but it
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:02.760]  was cracked in a way that it was unusable.
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:08.040]  So we took it and I kind of suspected the whole top would have to be replaced because
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:13.640]  he kind of like the the aluminum around the display was dented to, you know, but we had
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:17.320]  to drop it off and let them have it for a couple of days before they would tell us how
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:22.080]  much it costs because it's not just that part, it's, you know, they had to test the logic
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:23.640]  board, etc.
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:27.440]  You know, it turned out all we needed was the new top piece, you know, just the whole
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:33.360]  thing with the display and the aluminum and the Apple logo in the back.
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:34.620]  But you don't know that in advance.
[01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:38.600]  And if all this other stuff, if you've taken apart the whole thing, I don't, how are they,
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:41.300]  how would they, how much work would they have to do before they could even tell this guy
[01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:43.320]  how much it would cost to fix his iMac Pro?
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:47.360]  Well, and he would bring it in in pieces.
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:50.120]  No, I wouldn't do it.
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:52.560]  I'm sorry, I wouldn't do it.
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:55.920]  Did you ever watch the jackass movies?
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:56.920]  Yeah.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:03.560]  Oh, I have a real shame to admit it about how much how much I love the jackass movies
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:06.120]  and how many times I've watched them all.
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:07.200]  But there's the gag.
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:12.960]  I think it's in the first jackass movie where Johnny Knoxville goes into a rental car place
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:18.320]  and rents a car and declines their insurance.
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:31.480]  And then he literally drives it in a demolition derby
[01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:34.600]  and then drives it back to the lot.
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:38.920]  And it's just absolutely hilarious.
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:43.720]  That's to me, you know what this iMac story, it's like you said, like, it's almost like
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:48.600]  he brings the iMac in like a sack full of pieces.
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:50.760]  And it's like, here, fix this.
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:54.040]  No, would you would you have fixed it?
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.680]  Do you think Apple should have fixed it?
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:56.680]  I don't know.
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:21:02.320]  I guess I'd have to, you know, I don't know enough about, about how to, you know, what's
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:07.920]  going on inside an iMac Pro, to know how much work it would be to evaluate, you know, how
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:13.480]  much there is, I can, and I'd have to so I but I can imagine given that they took the
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:17.600]  whole thing apart, and that they have so many problems that they already know about, I could
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:22.560]  imagine that it's in a state where I would, I would reasonably say no, I declined to fix
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:27.640]  this, I think, you know, you're gonna have to just buy a new buy a new machine.
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:31.640]  Think about what would happen if they did fix it.
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:36.400]  And there was something else that, you know, was wrong in there that they didn't pick up.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:38.600]  And then you have to go back and fix that.
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:46.360]  And you know, how, how long do these repairs go on, through no fault of Apple or the Apple
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:51.520]  certified technicians or whoever fixes it?
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:53.520]  You know, that could be going on for years.
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.520]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:58.040]  So just a weird story.
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:21:59.040]  Yeah.
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.600]  No, you're done.
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:01.600]  Get out.
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:02.600]  Get out.
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:03.600]  Get out.
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:04.600]  Get the hell out of here.
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:05.600]  Yeah.
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:09.560]  I wouldn't even have to say a word to him.
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:13.680]  I just look at him, you know, to get out, you should, you should take that bag of parts
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:14.680]  with you.
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:18.080]  Yeah, you should, you should get a job doing part time genius bar work.
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:20.680]  Your customer service would be outstanding.
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:22.960]  It'd be outstanding.
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:28.840]  I'll tell you, I offered like Daniel Jalkett, if he wanted, I'd do support emails for him.
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:32.840]  I said, you'll have nobody emailing you within a month.
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:35.800]  Daniel Jalkett does a red sweater software fame.
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:36.800]  Yes.
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:43.480]  Yes, I offered him that, you know, that he declined, but you know, you wouldn't have
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:44.480]  to worry about it.
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:46.040]  I have a way with people.
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:48.160]  Yes, you do.
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:53.720]  Hey, let me take the third and final break here and thank our third sponsor.
[01:22:53.720 --> 01:23:00.240]  And it's after two first time sponsors, we have a sponsor who I seem to recall having
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:02.040]  before, but it's been a while.
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:04.640]  It's our friends at Squarespace.

[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:00.040]  What else do we got?
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:05.080]  I guess the only other thing I really wanted to talk about was this chat.
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:07.440]  Google announced a new thing.
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:11.160]  I don't know how long this was in the works at the first I heard of it.
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:17.520]  Call it RC, RCS, but they're just calling it chat and they're proposing it as a successor
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:22.240]  to SMS unencrypted though.
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:24.440]  That's the, to me, that's the deal breaker.
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:29.240]  In today's day, and you know, talk about the way that the world, ways the world has changed
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:30.240]  in 10 years.
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:34.720]  You know, it's often, I know it's, I think Bill Gates said it, somebody else did, but
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:39.360]  it's, you know, it's repeated often enough that who even knows who came up with it first,
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:47.680]  but that in technology we constantly overestimate how much we can get done in a year and constantly
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:51.240]  underestimate how much change will happen in 10 years.
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:52.240]  Right?
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:54.560]  And that is, it's always been true.
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:26:00.040]  Like, you know, it was any of our computing landscape all that different one year ago
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:01.360]  from today.
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:05.520]  Not really, you know, but 10 years ago, man.
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:10.400]  And it's like, you know, 10 years ago, you know, and longer, you know, everything just
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:14.080]  went out over the, you know, internet in plain text.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:17.500]  I mean, it's, you know, it just was what it was.
[01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:22.080]  We just, you know, as a whole, we were shortsighted and, and, you know, and I think, you know,
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:26.140]  and I think it's natural, I think if there's alien civilizations out there, it's probably
[01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:30.480]  true that when they get around to making their version of the internet, that it starts out
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:37.320]  unencrypted at first and then gets encrypted because, you know, doing encryption is harder
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:38.320]  than not doing encryption.
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:45.320]  And so you do the easy thing first, but then you run into problems you know, everything
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:55.000]  from crime to protecting yourself from, you know, government snooping to, you know, just
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  any privacy, privacy, right?
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.680]  It not just secure, not just security, security, yeah, everything, right?
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:11.000]  I just can't so like, I understand, I can imagine why SMS, the original SMS is not encrypted.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:16.760]  But in 2018, for the successor to it, to not be end to end encrypted, to me, it's like
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:17.760]  a deal breaker.
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:23.000]  It's like, why would you I support something new and encourage people to you, hey, here's
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:30.760]  this great new thing with with a really serious problem in so far is that it's not encrypted
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:31.760]  at all.
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:35.840]  It's just as you know, any so anybody at the phone company or whatever, you know, you're
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:36.840]  just
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:41.280]  Why do you think they're doing this?
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:49.240]  Why would you recommend an absolutely unencrypted type of SMS?
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:54.480]  So why isn't it encrypted is the quite like, why is Google pushing this thing put the encryption
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:55.840]  issue aside, right?
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:59.840]  Why is Google pushing this new technology?
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:05.120]  The exclusive story they gave went to Dieter Bohn at the verge.
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:10.320]  It's a good story, I will, I will put it in the in the show notes.
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:16.440]  But the gist of it, it was largely framed in comparison to iMessage, right?
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:20.360]  And I don't know how much of that was Dieter framing it that way.
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:25.920]  And how much of it was that's the story he was told by Google, as they, you know, gave
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:30.400]  him the briefing and this exclusive first take on it.
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:33.480]  But it certainly makes sense that it's on Google's mind, right that they and they've
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:38.160]  been trying to it's almost comical, how many times to Google has come out with some kind
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:43.960]  of chat like product, right, and yet hasn't taken.
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:50.640]  And they even, you know, it's almost it, you know, it's, it's almost embarrassing how many
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:54.200]  times they've done it, including like, I guess it was two years ago, and they came out with
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:29:00.220]  this aloe, which was even even I remember watching the keynote that their IO conference
[01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:04.240]  where it was like, Okay, we've tried a lot of things with chat before, but now we've
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:05.800]  got it.
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:07.960]  Apparently not.
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:15.500]  But I get why I message is a problem for Android, because I message it's, you know, has things
[01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:17.800]  that SMS doesn't have.
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:19.040]  And it's nice to have them.
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:23.180]  And when people see it, they think, Well, I wish I had something like that.
[01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:25.640]  It does group chats better than SMS.
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:35.040]  It has the read receipts and the delivered receipts, the little dot dot dot typing indicator,
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:40.440]  which is I it sounds like a little thing, but that's, it's, it's, I've been thinking about
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:43.640]  it ever since the story came out and noticing when I'm chatting with people, including you
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:46.660]  today setting up, you know, when to record the show.
[01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:51.000]  It's such a nice thing to have that dot dot dot, right.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:56.520]  And it's like, I know, you know, Jim's answering me what time is good to record, you know,
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:58.040]  and I know, hey, I'll just wait.
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:29:59.400]  I'm not I won't put the phone away.
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:03.160]  I'll wait because you know, he's typing something.
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:07.560]  So I guess this RCS protocol has all of these things.
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:10.280]  So I get why they're pushing it on those things.
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:12.000]  But why isn't it encrypted?
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000]  I don't know.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.720]  I wonder because this is the part of it.
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:22.240]  I wouldn't bet on this thing ever taking off, frankly, because it and they've signed up,
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:26.680]  they've announced it, Google's announced it, and they have a slide with, you know, 100
[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:30.920]  different carriers from around the world who've sworn that they're going to adopt this.
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:35.400]  But you know, getting someone at Verizon and AT&T and T mobile and all these other carriers
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:41.000]  around the country to say yes, we will support this here, you can use our logo when you announce
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.000]  it.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.560]  It's very different than actually getting them to support it, right?
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:49.240]  It's easy to say, sure, I'll do it.
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:53.080]  And it's a lot of work to actually implement it.
[01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:55.720]  But because it with an iPhone will use it.
[01:30:55.720 --> 01:31:01.080]  Well, that's it, we can hold shelve that because then we, you know, we'll come back to it.
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:04.800]  Let's say this does happen and carriers do support it.
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:06.620]  Would Apple support it in iOS?
[01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:08.480]  Let's hold that for now.
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:14.880]  I wonder if technically, and I've been looking for and I haven't seen anybody answer it.
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:21.520]  If it's like impossible for something that's carrier based like this to be end to end encrypted.
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:28.080]  Like maybe there's a technical reason that that, you know, you know, and because it crosses
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:34.840]  carrier boundaries, like, do you need to have a central authority to, you know, like when
[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:40.720]  you use like, iMessage, it's all good, it all goes through Apple servers, and Apple,
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:45.700]  you know, manages the, you know, the keys that you use, I don't know, maybe there's
[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:49.280]  a technical reason that it couldn't be end to end encrypted.
[01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:53.080]  But the other thing is, it doesn't seem to be encrypted at all.
[01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:57.900]  Like, that's what I kind of don't understand, I don't understand why, even if it's not end
[01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:02.720]  to end encrypted, why isn't it at least encrypted?
[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:08.600]  In some way, I mean, end to end encrypted, I'm not an expert on this encryption stuff,
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:15.480]  but basically, end to end encrypted means that when I text, send an iMessage to you,
[01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:23.640]  as it leaves my phone, it is encrypted with, you know, my public key and your private key,
[01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:26.000]  and it leaves my phone.
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.600]  And until it gets to your phone, it's not decrypted.
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:36.200]  And so there's literally there is no mathematical way there's no, well, I suppose there's a
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:41.440]  mathematical way where you could, you know, take a trillion years to, you know, try every
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:44.800]  combination, you know, to decrypt it.
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:51.720]  But there's no point where Apple has the unencrypted text of the message.
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:56.400]  It's you know, like it, and that's, that's the way you want it, right.
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:33:02.280]  So if, you know, the FBI comes to Apple and wants to know what Jim Dow Rumpel and Gruber
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:07.880]  were talking about on April 25, Apple, as I guess, can tell them that we did text each
[01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:12.200]  other, but they can't, there's no way there is no version of the text that they can show
[01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:13.200]  them.
[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:14.200]  That's a good design.
[01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:16.200]  Would they even know that?
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:17.200]  I don't know.
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:18.200]  I think so.
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:19.200]  I think that they have to have the metadata on.
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:20.720]  I don't know how long they keep it.
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:27.280]  But I think that they do know because it does go through Apple's servers.
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:32.920]  But I thought all of that even going that was anonymous.
[01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:33.920]  I don't think so.
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:34.920]  How could it be?
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:42.080]  They could, then couldn't they say, Well, did you know, in some criminal case, did he?
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:43.440]  I suppose you'd still need it.
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:48.560]  But I don't know, I just I didn't even think that they would be able to tell that.
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:50.400]  But a different design for a chat.
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:58.720]  And this would be a bad design, but a different design would be a design where my phone, it
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:04.880]  leaves the message leaves my phone encrypted, it goes to Apple server and gets decrypted.
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:07.720]  And then they re encrypt it and send it to you.
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:14.260]  And that there's, you know, that that still would be better than nothing.
[01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:16.840]  I don't know, maybe it maybe that's actually not better than nothing, though.
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:17.840]  I've been thinking about it.
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:24.480]  Maybe actually, like a, you know, encryption that's not end to end is worse than not having
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:28.640]  encryption because it creates the false sense that you have something protecting you.
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:29.640]  And you shouldn't.
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:30.640]  Yeah.
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:37.920]  I, I just can't see how they come back.
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:42.240]  A technology that isn't end to end encrypted.
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:43.240]  Not these days.
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:45.960]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:49.240]  But, you know, trying to play devil's advocate here.
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:53.960]  So I think it's a non starter, if I were at Apple, I would not want to touch this new
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:54.960]  thing.
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:58.400]  I mean, we have SMS, because it's a legacy thing, and we need to support it.
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:03.920]  But I wouldn't want to get into a new thing that's not end to end encrypted.
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:09.960]  But you know, is that would that be perceived, though, as being spiteful, like protective
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:13.940]  of iMessage compared to this new thing?
[01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:20.280]  Or would it be, again, protecting people's privacy and security, right?
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:25.200]  By not creating an illusion that you know that that this new thing is anything but,
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:27.680]  you know, insecure, right?
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:30.420]  I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
[01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:33.520]  Let's just assume that this goes through and the carriers adopted, I wouldn't be a bit
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:37.680]  surprised for Apple to come out and say we're not going to support it, because it's wide
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:45.340]  open and dangerous or potentially, you know, written, fraught with problems, or I wouldn't
[01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:48.440]  be a bit surprised to see them say something like that.
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:49.440]  Yeah.
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:55.960]  Yeah, I don't I don't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for Apple to support
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:58.400]  this in iOS.
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:04.380]  Not unless they, they, you know, tighten it down some and I don't mean it's just it's
[01:36:04.380 --> 01:36:05.380]  just wide open.
[01:36:05.380 --> 01:36:07.600]  But I don't think that they need to be protective of it.
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:12.360]  I think if there was a good encryption story to go along with this new protocol, I think
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:14.720]  I would bet that Apple would support it.
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:18.880]  Like I don't think Apple needs to be overly protective of iMessage.
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:22.440]  No, you know.
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:28.920]  And I think it I don't think it would stop people from using it, you know, iMessage that
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:29.920]  is.
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:31.440]  It's not like I know.
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:33.040]  But it would be nice.
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:35.960]  In theory, though, it would be nice that when somebody who has an Android phone text me,
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:40.240]  it'd be nice to get some of the features, you know, that iMessage has, but
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:45.480]  yeah, I wouldn't use it.
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:48.920]  Yeah, I don't expect Apple to do it.
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:49.920]  Isn't it weird?
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:54.460]  I think iMessage I've been meaning to write about this.
[01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:56.560]  But it's almost too.
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:00.960]  It's maybe it's a better podcast topic, because it's it's not quite a cohesive idea.
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:05.640]  But I can't help but think this idea that this article really rejiggered it in my head.
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:08.300]  I've come back to it every couple months for a while.
[01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:16.360]  But I feel like iMessage is it's pervasive amongst those of us who have Apple devices
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:21.160]  and amongst my friends and family.
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:25.480]  It's like, by far and away, the number one way that we communicate.
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:28.120]  Absolutely.
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:33.040]  And it's like me and you, that's the only way we communicate other than when we're recording
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:36.240]  a podcast.
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:39.640]  And when we're face to face, like at an Apple event.
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:43.980]  Other than that, I mean, it's all iMessage when's the last time you or I emailed each
[01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:44.980]  other?
[01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:45.980]  I don't know if you emailed me.
[01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:46.980]  I don't see it.
[01:37:46.980 --> 01:37:47.980]  Wow.
[01:37:47.980 --> 01:37:48.980]  It was.
[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:52.800]  It must be years since we emailed I mean, even even if we're going to chat on the phone,
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:53.800]  right?
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:54.800]  We set up a message first.
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:58.080]  Yeah, we'll usually text each other and say, Hey, you got a minute?
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:00.400]  And then you'll call or I'll call or whatever.
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:05.080]  But it's all based in iMessage.
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:10.320]  But I feel like even though it's everywhere, and I feel like it's really reliable.
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:15.380]  And I know every once in a while messages come out of sync, and I still see it once
[01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:16.380]  in a while.
[01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:23.040]  Like if I don't use my iPad for over a week, and then I turn it on, it, you know, iMessages
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:27.080]  start coming in funny, you know, or I'll get notifications for ones that I shouldn't be
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:32.000]  getting notifications of, because they're old, but it's like, I suspect what's happened
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:37.320]  is that those notifications are queued up, you know, that they've been there waiting
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:40.400]  to waiting to make a noise.
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:44.380]  I've been waiting all week to ping you.
[01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:46.320]  But I feel like all of those things have gotten better.
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:48.840]  And it's, like, it's super reliable.
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:50.000]  It's super fast.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.440]  It's everything Apple, people say Apple can't do.
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:56.080]  It's, you know, super reliable, fast online service.
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:03.360]  It handles, I looked this up, they haven't announced numbers in a long time.
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:07.440]  Like years ago, they would say like, how many, many, many years ago, like they would say
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:11.480]  how many iMessages they sent in a day or something.
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:14.160]  But they haven't released any numbers like that in years.
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:16.960]  So I don't it's, it's not worth using the old numbers.
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:22.760]  And the only one I saw that was more recent was like in 2016, Eddy Q said that at its
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:28.960]  peak, the highest peak that they had reached was 200,000 iMessages per second.
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:30.560]  Now obviously, that's a peak.
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:34.640]  That's not, you can't just multiply by how many seconds are in a day to figure out how
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:38.540]  many iMessages they handle a day.
[01:39:38.540 --> 01:39:42.800]  But the funny thing about that is I was googling it, I got it from a Business Insider article.
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:45.240]  And I was like, oh, that's interesting, but it rings a bell.
[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:49.920]  And then at the bottom of the article, it said that Q revealed this information on John
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:56.560]  Grouper's The Talk Show.
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:57.680]  I thought that was funny.
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:02.320]  I thought that was funny that I've done some research and discovered something that I was
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:07.240]  told on my own podcast.
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:13.400]  You were probably online shopping for keyboards at that point, right?
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:14.400]  I don't know.
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:18.840]  I just I know that Apple can't sell iMessage.
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:22.760]  It's not like they're, number one, they don't need the cash, last I heard.
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:29.640]  But they can't effectively spin it off into an independent company.
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:31.560]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:37.640]  It's integrated into the whole iCloud identity and experience.
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:44.960]  But when you see something like WhatsApp selling for $20 billion, again, it's not like they
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:53.120]  can sell iMessage, but I think it has to be considered a $20 billion asset to the company.
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:59.960]  And if they did release the number of active users and how many messages a day they send,
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:03.920]  I can't help but suspect that those numbers would be just staggering.
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:11.480]  Well, even at a peak at 200,000 per second.
[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:18.200]  What have they said, didn't they release how many active devices, are there a billion active
[01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:19.200]  Apple devices?
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:21.440]  Yeah, I believe it's over a billion now.
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:26.120]  Yeah, I think last year they announced that there's a billion Apple devices in active
[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:27.120]  use.
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:33.160]  But that's really, really, really hard to extrapolate how many iMessage users there
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:34.160]  might be from that.
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:35.160]  Yeah, you can.
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:46.920]  I'm going to say, though, that I would guess at least 99% of those people do use iMessage.
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:51.240]  Who has an Apple product and doesn't use iMessage at all?
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:56.360]  Probably the most likely would be somebody who uses a Mac and doesn't have any of the
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:57.360]  other devices.
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:02.880]  I could see if you're just like, depending on your job, you might use a Mac because you
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:08.000]  needed a Mac, but that you're not into the whole iCloud thing.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.280]  Whereas like iPhone and iPad users, I just can't see how who doesn't use iMessage.
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:17.880]  But if well, billion devices, I mean, like, how many I mean, Christ, I must have 20 of
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:18.880]  them myself.
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:23.520]  Like, it's not a one to one, you know, I mean, I've got, I'm using three of them right now.
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:29.800]  I've got the watch, I've got my phone in my pocket and a MacBook, I'm talking to you through.
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:35.320]  My 90 year old grandmother, I messaged me last night.
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:39.440]  You know, she she has an iPad she uses message.
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:44.280]  So yeah, you know, what's funny, my mom messages me now too.
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:46.160]  And she's not 90.
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:49.840]  But you know, not not technically adept.
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:53.400]  My dad to my mom and dad both iMessage me.
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:43:00.400]  And they've been using email since I don't know, 1997 or something, you know, they're
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:03.920]  way better at iMessage than email.
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:12.000]  You know, it's and I think they're more, it's just, it's just a more natural way to communicate.
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:18.360]  You want to hear here's something funny, my, my mother and I, I messaged all the time,
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:22.640]  you know, we're just that's how we communicate because she's back in Canada.
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:25.800]  So they're actually here right now.
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:32.320]  And we're looking at my father's phone and you know, he doesn't get any texts or any
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:34.680]  calls or anything on his phone.
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:39.640]  Well, he turned on Do Not Disturb.
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:46.480]  And we said, she said, she said, Did you know you had Do Not Disturb on and he's like, What?
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:47.480]  Really?
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:50.360]  Yeah, that's the only thing that he did on his phone.
[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:58.480]  He plays like solitaire and stuff on his phone, but and Scrabble or something, but he turned
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:43:59.480]  on Do Not Disturb.
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:01.400]  So he gets nothing.
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:08.080]  It was hilarious just to look at his face like, Oh, shit, you found it.
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:12.480]  Just ballpark, how many how many active iMessage users do you think there are, given that there's
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:14.560]  a billion devices?
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:19.200]  Oh, my God, I would have to think that it's most
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:22.600]  well, but how many people though, I'm gonna just
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:25.720]  Oh, a billion devices.
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:28.960]  I'm gonna say 200 250 million people.
[01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:31.720]  I think there's probably more than that.
[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:32.720]  Right?
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:35.080]  Because then that would be like four devices per person.
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:40.480]  And that's probably more than typical, like, because there's got to be, there have to be
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:48.720]  10s and 10s, if not 100 million people who only have one Apple device, and it's an iPhone.
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:49.720]  Right?
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:50.720]  No, I agree with that.
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:52.400]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:57.540]  People who don't want to don't want a Mac and don't don't want an iPad or can't afford
[01:44:57.540 --> 01:45:02.200]  both and, you know, have no interest in the Apple Watch, you know, there have to be, you
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:06.480]  know, I don't know, 300 million, 400 million.
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:07.480]  It's got to be about that.
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:11.960]  Now, I know Facebook, Facebook says they have like 2 billion users, but and you know, it's
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:18.160]  not going to be a number that big, but I think by I don't know, I just can't help but think
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:24.440]  that iMessage is in that ballpark, at least, right for I would go somewhere between three
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:26.720]  and 400 million, right?
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:33.360]  And you know, probably, you know, who knows how many messages a day, it's crazy.
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:36.800]  I don't know, I kind of, you know, if anybody to Apple is listening, and you're planning
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:43.280]  a WWDC keynote, I, I would love a little segment, I'd like an update on iMessage and tell us
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:47.720]  how, tell us how many users there are and how many messages you handle a day.
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:50.520]  I would just like to know how many messages they handle a day.
[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:52.620]  Yeah, the users say that's, that's cool.
[01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:59.080]  But I want, I want to boggle the mind, right, of how many messages are handled today.
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:00.280]  Yeah, it's gotta be crazy.
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:02.120]  200,000 a second is nuts.
[01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:09.880]  If you think about it, like, I, you know, I, it makes the idea of of architecting a
[01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:16.380]  system that would handle 200,000 messages per second, or be able to do that.
[01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:18.860]  And that's like a two year old number, I believe.
[01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:23.640]  So it's surely they've reached a much higher peak since then.
[01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:25.920]  Maybe 200,000 is the average now.
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:32.900]  It makes me feel as though my understanding of how computers work is at the level of two
[01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:36.240]  tin cans and a piece of string.
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:39.160]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:40.160]  I don't disagree.
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:41.160]  Yeah.
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:45.640]  And I but nobody really talks about it until you know, nobody really talks about the grand
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:52.200]  success that I messages until a purported I message killer comes up.
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:58.860]  Like the only time anybody ever messaged messages or mentions it is when you know, I messages
[01:46:58.860 --> 01:47:02.600]  is such an integral part of how we communicate now.
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:04.760]  So we kind of take it for granted, right?
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:05.760]  That's easy.
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:10.840]  You know, like, yeah, because it's just there and it always works.
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:15.300]  So you know, if I need to get a hold of you, the first thing I'm going to do is just you
[01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:21.800]  know, go into messages and, and, you know, just give you a quick ping and that's, that's
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:22.800]  how it works.
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:27.560]  It's also kind of a neat success story about the Apple way of doing things and this sort
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:35.480]  of asking forgiveness instead of it afterwards, instead of asking for permission, the way
[01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:41.560]  that they piggyback on SMS on the iPhone, right, because it was I don't know, a couple
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:49.480]  of years into the iPhone when they announced it and it's such a clever way that you don't
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:56.920]  bite, you know, and if it was another company that you didn't trust, you might say devious,
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:48:00.760]  but I think people do trust it and you can turn it off, you know what I mean?
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:06.320]  It's not hard to turn off I message and only use SMS.
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:12.840]  It's you know, any, anybody who's ever used the settings app to change anything could
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:14.080]  find that if they want to.
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:15.080]  It's not too hard.
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:16.080]  It's not buried.
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:22.520]  It's not like these obtuse language right there, but it's really clever the way that
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:27.600]  they turned it on by default and if you just all you do is get a new phone or update your
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:32.060]  phone to the new OS and all of a sudden if you're communicating to another person who's
[01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:39.080]  also using I message, your message will be blue instead of green automatically.
[01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:44.700]  And I don't feel like they get enough credit for how, you know, how, how and it's almost
[01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:49.000]  like that's what it was so it's so seamless that that's almost why people don't give
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.600]  them credit because it's like we didn't, you didn't even notice it.
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:54.060]  Yep.
[01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:55.740]  But that's how they do a lot of this stuff.
[01:48:55.740 --> 01:49:04.200]  It's just so easy and so integrated into the operating system and how we use the device.
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:07.040]  You know, it, it, of course it's there, right?
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:08.040]  That's what you expect.
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:09.040]  All right.
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:13.360]  And, and, you know, just circling back on the encryption thing I've told this story,
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:17.980]  you know, many times, but it's you know, many, many years ago, I was speaking to somebody
[01:49:17.980 --> 01:49:25.160]  at Apple who was there for it and I guess it was jobs himself because Steve Jobs was
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:29.020]  still there, but that the message came down from on high that we, you know, we should
[01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:32.040]  do this messaging thing.
[01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:39.220]  And rule one is design it, you know, like from the point where it was just a blank sheet
[01:49:39.220 --> 01:49:41.860]  of paper in front of the engineers who were working on it.
[01:49:41.860 --> 01:49:46.440]  You know, rule one is let's architect this from the ground up so that we can never see
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:51.880]  the contents of an I message so that if law enforcement in any country around the world
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:56.520]  comes to us and says, show us, you know, these messages, we can look them right in the eye
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:50:04.080]  and say, we, we can't not, we won't, but we can't is, I mean, what a great thing.
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:11.720]  You know, how much of our communications now are securely encrypted and, and that wouldn't
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:15.920]  have been, if not for I message, it's tremendous like email.
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:19.840]  There's ways to do encryption and email, but it's such a pain in the ass that nobody I
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:22.040]  know uses it regularly.
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:23.920]  No me neither.
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:31.200]  That's why something like what Google is, is presenting here stands out so much because
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:32.200]  it's not.
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:33.200]  All right.
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:39.040]  And in 2018 it just, it just, it's almost like, and when I message came out, the encryption
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:40.960]  angle wasn't a big part of the story.
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:42.420]  They definitely mentioned it.
[01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:48.880]  And maybe that's just me personally not being as privacy minded then as I am now.
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:53.260]  Maybe they were trying to get my attention to it, but I just didn't notice or pick up
[01:50:53.260 --> 01:50:56.400]  on it.
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:01.480]  But that's, you know, I, it's one way that I think Apple was forward thinking on this.
[01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:06.920]  I think that Apple kind of had their, their come to Jesus wake up moment at some point
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:13.280]  in, you know, around 12 years ago, you know, 12, 13 years ago where they sort of looked
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:17.960]  at everything they were doing and, you know, you know, cause it's almost comical how, how
[01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:21.480]  little encryption there was on, on some of this stuff, you know, like the way that the
[01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:25.480]  original iPhone, you could just plug it into any computer and go into iTunes and look inside
[01:51:25.480 --> 01:51:26.480]  it.
[01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:27.480]  Yup.
[01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:28.480]  Yup.
[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:31.080]  But it was all so new then.
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:32.080]  Right.
[01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:34.760]  And you know, and who really thought that you needed to encrypt your phone?
[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:41.880]  You know, I mean if, if we were still be able to do that now, that might be a problem.
[01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:46.800]  You know how like there's these, these things now, like there's these services where there's
[01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:51.960]  like an Israeli company and like law enforcement can buy like a $20,000 device that they say
[01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:56.520]  can get you into an iPhone.
[01:51:56.520 --> 01:51:58.760]  There's a couple of these, but they're very expensive.
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:04.000]  You know, it's just comical to think that like, Hey, when the iPhone first came out,
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:12.280]  the thing that could let the cops into your phone was called iTunes, iTunes and a 30 pin,
[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:17.520]  a USB connector, and anybody could get into any phone.
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:21.200]  It was crazy.
[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:27.640]  Well, I mean, that's what it was and look where we are now.
[01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:28.640]  Right.
[01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:35.280]  I mean, I, I appreciate Apple stance on encryption and privacy and, and everything else.
[01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:39.760]  Would you, I mean, think to me that it's, it's one last thing on this chat service,
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:44.440]  this new chat protocol, not being encrypted and why it sticks out to me, it, to me, it
[01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:48.360]  would be like if somebody came out with a new phone, you know, like a, the essential
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:52.680]  phone from Andy Rubin's company came out and there was no encryption on the phone.
[01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:59.100]  You know, like you just put your thumb on a button and you're in like, that's the way
[01:52:59.100 --> 01:53:06.200]  they used to work, but it's, you know, it is not the way that they would work today.
[01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:07.360]  No.
[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:15.120]  And they can't, and, and again, this is why this thing from Google sticks out so badly.
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:16.120]  Yeah.
[01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:18.960]  Because, you know, you're looking at it saying, really?
[01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:23.040]  And you, and the thing that I find irritating is, you know, that they know better, right?
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:28.040]  The people who were working on this, they, they know, you know, I don't know, anyway,
[01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:35.920]  if anybody out there can explain if they know if it's other than, you know, maybe the carriers
[01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:36.920]  don't want it.
[01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:42.040]  Or if it's political, like, did the carriers like the fact that they can see your text
[01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:43.040]  messages, you know?
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:44.040]  Yeah.
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:47.320]  But I mean, the, the carriers didn't like a lot of what Apple did either and they did
[01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:48.320]  it anyway.
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:51.440]  No, but that's the difference between Apple and Google and Android, right?
[01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:56.240]  The carriers still have a ton of say over what's on Android, you know, at least on the
[01:53:56.240 --> 01:54:01.200]  ones that they, that the phones that they sell themselves, like when you go to Verizon
[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:06.040]  and buy an Android phone that has a Verizon logo on the phone, you know, Verizon has all
[01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:10.120]  sorts of stuff in there and all sorts of say about what's in there.
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:13.920]  Like I don't think those phones ship with 90, I'm 99% sure they don't ship with the
[01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:15.840]  Allo app, right?
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:19.560]  Like you buy the Google Pixel and you get stuff like that.
[01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:25.800]  But I don't know, I can't help but wonder if it's technical or if it's lazy or if it's
[01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:30.880]  political like, or if there's too many, maybe it's not even a US thing, but to get this
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:35.000]  to be a worldwide standard, there's too many carriers around the world who for political
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:39.640]  reasons don't want these messages encrypted.
[01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:43.360]  And then to get everybody on, you know, to get everybody on the same page, it's, you
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:49.560]  know, it, but regardless, it, it shows the, the advantages.
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:54.000]  And again, there might be, there's disadvantages too, but you know, there are advantages to
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:59.280]  Apple's ability to do the whole things themselves and just say, here's what's going to happen
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:02.680]  in September when this new version of iOS comes out.
[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:06.880]  All of your texts, when you send them to other iPhone users will be over iMessage instead
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:09.400]  of SMS and they'll be end to end encrypted.
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:10.400]  And that's it.
[01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:11.400]  Perfect.
[01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:15.160]  Anything, look how it worked out.
[01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:16.160]  Yeah.
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:17.560]  Anything else you wanted to talk about this week?
[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:24.400]  No, no, I, I, I thought that was, that was great.
[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:25.400]  Yeah.
[01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:31.480]  Everybody can read your fine work and the work of your colleagues, Dave and Sean King,
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:36.840]  Dave, Dave, Mark, who you mentioned before, I should mention and Sean King over at a loop
[01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:43.120]  insight.com the loop and uh, and then on Twitter they can get their fill of Dalrymple.
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:44.120]  What's your Twitter handle?
[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:45.120]  J Dalrymple.
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:46.120]  Yeah.
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:47.120]  There you go.
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:49.640]  Uh, Jim, it's always a pleasure talking to you.
[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:50.960]  Yeah, I love it.
[01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:52.200]  Uh, I'll see you soon.
[01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:53.200]  Right.
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:54.200]  We'll be at WWDC before we know it.
[01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:56.520]  Do you have a, you're doing a party this year?
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:55:59.000]  I, I am doing a party this year.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.000]  Yes.
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:09.880]  Uh, it said, um, the Ritz, uh, club and rate right around the corner from, um, where dub
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:13.840]  dub DC has held the convention center right around the corner from everything.
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:16.480]  Everything in San Jose is right around the corner from the convention center.
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:17.480]  Yeah.
[01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:18.480]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:19.800]  So yeah, it's going to be fun.
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:20.800]  What night?
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:22.560]  What night is that going to be Monday?
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:23.560]  Monday night?
[01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:24.780]  That's going to be the night.
[01:56:24.780 --> 01:56:25.780]  The beard bash.
[01:56:25.780 --> 01:56:27.200]  Uh, well I look forward to that.
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:28.640]  I look forward to seeing you there.
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:32.760]  Um, yeah, um, maybe we'll do a podcast there.
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:35.880]  Maybe we'll get into that, uh, podcast layer again.
[01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:37.080]  Remember last year?
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:38.360]  That was so much fun.
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:41.960]  What we, we drank like case of Heineken, you and I and Matt trance.
[01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:47.840]  Well I did, I did, I availed myself of the, the complimentary Heineken's I will admit
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:52.240]  and I did enjoy them, but I would have to say the, we that drank the whole case during
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:57:01.360]  the course of the show was largely you, well, it's not my fault you guys drink slow once
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:02.360]  you get going.
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:03.360]  It is really something to see.
[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:08.920]  I remember it cause that's fun too because we could look at each other and uh, um, I'm
[01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:11.840]  on these, uh, the, there's a new podcast called the menu bar.
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:12.840]  Have you heard of it?
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:17.480]  Zach Cichy and uh, uh, I'm going to be the guest on the next episode.
[01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:23.760]  Uh, and I was telling Zach when I've recorded the other day that, uh, boy, I, I, I don't
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:28.320]  record many episodes out of, you know, I think this is you, you, you right now, Jim, our,
[01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:32.000]  our episode two 20 of this incarnation of the talk show.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:37.280]  I've only done a handful of these over the years that weren't done over Skype.
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:42.520]  Um, but when, when you do do one in person, you could see it's so much, there's eye contact
[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:47.400]  and little bits of body English that can really make the conversation flow.
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:49.400]  And I just, yeah, absolutely.
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:54.720]  And I just remember last year in that pound, that podcast studio that Apple provides to
[01:57:54.720 --> 01:58:02.040]  podcasters inside, uh, WWDC, I remember looking at, looking at grants when you were popping
[01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:09.600]  like Heineken six and I was just like, I didn't have to say anything, but it was just like,
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:12.360]  it's like, it really is like drinking water for him.
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:17.360]  It's like drinking so much fun drinking water.
[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:21.200]  At the end of a, of a race through the desert.
[01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:23.640]  After a while, I just stopped offering to get you guys one.
[01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:25.120]  I just went and get them myself.
[01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:27.000]  I should double check about that and maybe schedule it.
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:31.320]  I actually have, I forgot entirely about that, but, uh, do you, I don't even know.
[01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:32.840]  I'm guessing they'll bring that back.
[01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:35.640]  I think that they considered that podcast thing a big success.
[01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:38.240]  Uh, don't know.
[01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:39.400]  Yeah.
[01:58:39.400 --> 01:58:44.120]  But I plan on recording one for, uh, uh, for mine.
[01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:45.120]  Wow.
[01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:46.120]  Such a nice setup.
[01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:47.120]  Anyway, I'll see you there.
[01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:48.120]  Beautiful.
[01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:49.120]  Looking forward to it.
[01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:51.320]  And, uh, I, as always, I greatly appreciate your time.
[01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:53.960]  It's always a pleasure to have you on the show, Jim.
[01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:54.960]  Love it.
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:55.960]  Always, always.
[01:58:55.960 --> 01:58:56.960]  All right.
[01:58:56.960 --> 01:58:57.960]  Talk to you soon.
[01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:27.820]  Bye.
