[00:00.000 --> 00:01.800]  You a doc, where do you put your doc?
[00:03.280 --> 00:04.120]  Bottom.
[00:04.120 --> 00:06.760]  Oh, bottom.
[00:06.760 --> 00:09.120]  Dan, I don't know if I could be your friend anymore.
[00:09.120 --> 00:12.560]  I'm a doc on the right, man.
[00:12.560 --> 00:14.080]  Doc on the left is acceptable,
[00:14.080 --> 00:16.320]  but doc on the bottom, you're losing,
[00:16.320 --> 00:18.300]  I need, to me, what I crave the most
[00:18.300 --> 00:20.000]  is vertical real estate.
[00:21.920 --> 00:23.980]  It is tricky on the 12-inch MacBook,
[00:23.980 --> 00:26.120]  although I had the doc pretty small,
[00:26.120 --> 00:27.600]  but I don't know, I never,
[00:27.600 --> 00:29.680]  I could never get used to the symmetry
[00:29.680 --> 00:31.280]  of having it on one of the sides
[00:31.280 --> 00:33.580]  and not having Windows take up the full width.
[00:34.640 --> 00:35.480]  Yeah.
[00:35.480 --> 00:36.760]  Like, the right side of my screen
[00:36.760 --> 00:39.640]  has been the AIM buddy list for 20 years,
[00:39.640 --> 00:40.480]  or more than that.
[00:43.400 --> 00:44.980]  Yeah, my doc icons are so small,
[00:44.980 --> 00:48.240]  and I don't even keep many apps in the doc,
[00:50.160 --> 00:51.420]  you know, like, permanently,
[00:51.420 --> 00:53.780]  but just the running apps is enough
[00:53.780 --> 00:55.600]  to make them tiny little targets,
[00:55.600 --> 00:58.440]  and it's not, like, that I lack the motor skills to do it,
[00:58.440 --> 01:01.440]  it's just that part of what I love about the Mac,
[01:01.440 --> 01:02.420]  and we could probably do a whole show
[01:02.420 --> 01:03.260]  about why I love the Mac,
[01:03.260 --> 01:05.760]  but it's like, I feel like I can just fly through the Mac,
[01:05.760 --> 01:07.560]  you know, like, I'm always clicking
[01:07.560 --> 01:09.400]  and moving my mouse extremely fast.
[01:11.480 --> 01:13.000]  Same, whenever I get a new job,
[01:13.000 --> 01:14.980]  I demand the fastest Mac possible,
[01:14.980 --> 01:17.500]  because it's, my brain is basically
[01:17.500 --> 01:19.960]  at the same speed of the computer,
[01:19.960 --> 01:23.040]  but whatever it is about doc clicking,
[01:23.040 --> 01:25.080]  it's just not, it's never gonna work.
[01:25.080 --> 01:26.300]  Yeah.
[01:26.300 --> 01:28.480]  Always the wrong icon.
[01:28.480 --> 01:30.520]  I'm just noticing now that Apple has added,
[01:30.520 --> 01:32.600]  it's very kind of them to do so,
[01:32.600 --> 01:35.540]  auto-added the iWork apps to my doc again
[01:35.540 --> 01:36.600]  for the 10th time.
[01:36.600 --> 01:38.320]  Oh, nice of them.
[01:38.320 --> 01:39.160]  Very kind.
[01:41.360 --> 01:43.240]  It's been a while since I've noticed that,
[01:43.240 --> 01:45.640]  but yeah, it's probably right there.
[01:45.640 --> 01:47.520]  I do use Numbers, that's the only one.
[01:47.520 --> 01:48.960]  I use Numbers a lot,
[01:48.960 --> 01:51.100]  I use it by far and away more than the others,
[01:51.100 --> 01:53.360]  even though I think Keynote is probably the best of the apps
[01:53.360 --> 01:56.160]  I use Numbers quite a bit.
[01:56.160 --> 01:58.240]  I keep like my sponsorship schedule
[01:58.240 --> 01:59.680]  in a Numbers spreadsheet,
[01:59.680 --> 02:01.640]  so that's the one that gets updated all the time,
[02:01.640 --> 02:03.480]  but I don't need it open all the time.
[02:05.760 --> 02:07.720]  I just noticed I have iBooks in there.
[02:07.720 --> 02:09.040]  Yep, they did that to me too.
[02:09.040 --> 02:09.880]  Very nice of them.
[02:09.880 --> 02:11.480]  Probably a mistake.
[02:11.480 --> 02:13.000]  Kind of them to put in an app
[02:13.000 --> 02:14.700]  that I never use on the Macintosh.
[02:19.040 --> 02:20.080]  How's your housework?
[02:20.080 --> 02:24.220]  Is it, are we gonna be interrupted by hammers?
[02:24.220 --> 02:25.320]  No, I don't think so.
[02:25.320 --> 02:26.720]  They did not show up today.
[02:26.720 --> 02:31.280]  So I've been very lucky in the game of roulette
[02:31.280 --> 02:33.920]  that is try to schedule a recording of the talk show
[02:33.920 --> 02:34.980]  on a day when the,
[02:34.980 --> 02:39.980]  when the guys banging away at my house are not here.
[02:41.120 --> 02:42.440]  So there we go.
[02:42.440 --> 02:44.560]  I forgot to check, are we holiday partying or no?
[02:44.560 --> 02:46.560]  I'm not, but you're certainly welcome to.
[02:46.560 --> 02:47.480]  Oh man.
[02:48.620 --> 02:49.460]  No, I'm just kidding.
[02:49.460 --> 02:51.600]  I do have a fizzy water though.
[02:51.600 --> 02:53.880]  No, I have a fizzy water and I have a,
[02:54.800 --> 02:58.680]  I have a, I don't know, some kind of fruit juice blend
[02:58.680 --> 03:02.920]  smoothie that I paid a lot of money for.
[03:02.920 --> 03:04.400]  Should we pour one out for the deck?
[03:04.400 --> 03:05.980]  Well, I know I poured one out for the deck
[03:05.980 --> 03:07.840]  with Jim yesterday.
[03:07.840 --> 03:09.280]  I saw you had a nice post.
[03:09.280 --> 03:10.880]  I am.
[03:10.880 --> 03:12.980]  Yeah, when I started Splat F,
[03:12.980 --> 03:15.200]  well, you know, your history with the deck
[03:15.200 --> 03:16.680]  goes back quite far.
[03:16.680 --> 03:18.600]  When I started Splat F in 2011,
[03:18.600 --> 03:21.760]  my only dream was to be deck worthy
[03:21.760 --> 03:24.800]  and I never got enough,
[03:24.800 --> 03:27.080]  well, I had a, I got a different deal
[03:27.080 --> 03:29.380]  from another company rather quickly.
[03:29.380 --> 03:31.860]  So I never, never got to work with the deck,
[03:31.860 --> 03:36.860]  but it was always something I aspired to work with.
[03:37.880 --> 03:41.240]  Yeah, I, well, I mean,
[03:41.240 --> 03:43.380]  I relayed a lot of the history on my post.
[03:43.380 --> 03:46.040]  I mean, it's a fine first topic for those who don't,
[03:46.040 --> 03:47.820]  you know, who are listening, who didn't pay attention.
[03:47.820 --> 03:51.140]  The deck network, a little ad network that,
[03:51.140 --> 03:52.380]  I mean, if you're listening to this
[03:52.380 --> 03:54.040]  and you don't know the little ads
[03:54.040 --> 03:56.280]  that have been on Daring Fireballs for 11 years,
[03:56.280 --> 03:58.840]  then I don't know how, you know, I can't help you, but.
[03:58.840 --> 04:00.280]  Then you're a part of the problem.
[04:00.280 --> 04:02.440]  Right, although I suppose there are people
[04:02.440 --> 04:05.560]  who might be, just read the whole thing by RSS,
[04:05.560 --> 04:07.320]  so it's possible.
[04:07.320 --> 04:10.980]  Anyway, the deck was a ad, well, it still is,
[04:10.980 --> 04:15.920]  as we speak, it's alive until tomorrow, end of March.
[04:15.920 --> 04:18.200]  An ad network for independent websites
[04:19.240 --> 04:20.960]  with a couple of very simple rules.
[04:20.960 --> 04:25.480]  Only takes ads from sponsors that we think are interesting.
[04:25.480 --> 04:27.160]  In the old days, we used to actually have a rule
[04:27.160 --> 04:30.080]  that it was somebody, some member of the deck network
[04:30.080 --> 04:34.000]  had to actually be a purchaser or user of the product,
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.920]  and that sort of went, that wasn't really sustainable,
[04:36.920 --> 04:38.880]  but we had to at least think, hey,
[04:38.880 --> 04:41.240]  this is something that the people who read the sites
[04:41.240 --> 04:46.240]  in the deck might actually like.
[04:46.280 --> 04:49.080]  One ad per page, so you're not allowed
[04:49.080 --> 04:51.800]  to join other networks and have 20 different ads on a page.
[04:51.800 --> 04:53.520]  The whole point was to make it exclusive
[04:53.520 --> 04:56.160]  and charge money for the exclusivity of,
[04:56.160 --> 04:58.760]  hey, if you wanna get a little graphical ad
[04:58.760 --> 05:02.400]  on a site like kotke.org or Daring Fireball,
[05:02.400 --> 05:04.560]  there's only gonna be one ad per page,
[05:04.560 --> 05:07.200]  and it's gonna be through the deck, and that's it.
[05:07.200 --> 05:10.160]  Very small, a relatively small bit
[05:10.160 --> 05:11.560]  of real estate on screen.
[05:11.560 --> 05:15.440]  No animation, no tracking, no JavaScript payloads,
[05:15.440 --> 05:19.680]  nothing like that, and it was a pretty good run, 11 years,
[05:19.680 --> 05:21.280]  but it's kaput.
[05:23.120 --> 05:25.860]  Do you think, obviously you're not Jim,
[05:25.860 --> 05:28.000]  but was there ever a point where you debated,
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.560]  okay, the screen sizes are getting bigger
[05:30.560 --> 05:33.660]  or the formats of the web are changing,
[05:33.660 --> 05:36.560]  should we make the ad bigger or something like that?
[05:36.560 --> 05:38.100]  You know, Kotke actually did that.
[05:38.100 --> 05:41.920]  If you look, Kotke, I don't even know how he's doing it.
[05:41.920 --> 05:46.880]  I think maybe because we did switch to retina images
[05:47.960 --> 05:49.840]  a couple of years ago for the obvious reason
[05:49.840 --> 05:52.280]  that the ones that weren't retina
[05:52.280 --> 05:54.240]  didn't look good on non-retina screens.
[05:56.920 --> 06:01.480]  There was some talk of it, but I think that it,
[06:01.480 --> 06:04.280]  like the last year or so, as Jim wrote in his post,
[06:04.280 --> 06:09.280]  his sort of goodbye post to it, the bigger problem
[06:10.800 --> 06:14.280]  was just that the interest from advertisers was dwindling,
[06:14.280 --> 06:16.520]  and so worrying about what the physical format,
[06:16.520 --> 06:18.000]  I mean, I suppose you could say, well,
[06:18.000 --> 06:19.880]  maybe if you fixed the format, there'd be more interest,
[06:19.880 --> 06:24.000]  but it seemed pretty clear that that wasn't the issue.
[06:24.000 --> 06:26.000]  The issue was that the money wasn't going
[06:26.000 --> 06:29.160]  to traditional web ads, period.
[06:29.160 --> 06:31.740]  It was going to social, you know, Facebook,
[06:31.740 --> 06:35.400]  and obviously, you know, online advertising
[06:35.400 --> 06:37.340]  is still going to Google, too.
[06:38.680 --> 06:39.680]  That was the bigger problem.
[06:39.680 --> 06:41.480]  I would also not be surprised if the,
[06:41.480 --> 06:43.840]  because I remember the kind of the gist
[06:43.840 --> 06:47.200]  was that the target audience was kind of
[06:47.200 --> 06:49.320]  a creative design crowd.
[06:49.320 --> 06:51.380]  I would not be surprised if the advertisers
[06:51.380 --> 06:54.280]  who were using the deck to reach that crowd
[06:54.280 --> 06:56.960]  are now advertising on things like this podcast
[06:56.960 --> 06:59.680]  instead of buying banner ads online,
[06:59.680 --> 07:02.080]  or at least putting some of their money into that.
[07:02.080 --> 07:03.920]  Yeah, yeah, and if you look,
[07:03.920 --> 07:05.260]  that's actually what Kottke's doing.
[07:05.260 --> 07:07.880]  Kottke's put, somehow, in his template,
[07:07.880 --> 07:11.640]  he's taking the ad and taking the retina size ad
[07:11.640 --> 07:15.680]  and running it at 2x, so it's a little bit blurry
[07:15.680 --> 07:18.000]  because it's double-sized, but it's,
[07:19.120 --> 07:22.080]  at least if you're looking at it on a retina screen,
[07:22.080 --> 07:26.780]  but he made it physically twice the size.
[07:26.780 --> 07:28.520]  That Kottke is very clever.
[07:28.520 --> 07:30.000]  He is.
[07:30.000 --> 07:31.580]  He does this thing that I'm not familiar with,
[07:31.580 --> 07:33.980]  which is change the design of his website
[07:33.980 --> 07:34.940]  every couple years.
[07:37.200 --> 07:39.620]  No, I am sad, I don't know.
[07:39.620 --> 07:41.600]  I probably came across it in my post.
[07:41.600 --> 07:42.640]  It's a sad thing.
[07:42.640 --> 07:44.120]  It is not a surprise, though,
[07:44.120 --> 07:46.680]  and it's like, and you don't, I don't know.
[07:46.680 --> 07:48.460]  I'm often uncomfortable talking about
[07:48.460 --> 07:49.680]  the behind-the-scenes stuff.
[07:49.680 --> 07:51.240]  I'm always uncomfortable talking about
[07:51.240 --> 07:53.360]  the business aspects of this stuff
[07:53.360 --> 07:57.360]  because I don't think, not so much out of
[07:59.040 --> 08:01.720]  sort of not wanting to talk about money, period,
[08:01.720 --> 08:05.680]  but just more that it's navel-gazing, to some ways,
[08:05.680 --> 08:07.060]  and then people write to me and they're like,
[08:07.060 --> 08:09.280]  no, no, I'm fascinated to hear about it,
[08:09.280 --> 08:12.060]  but it's like, I just worry that me talking about
[08:12.060 --> 08:15.880]  the behind-the-scenes stuff is of great interest to me,
[08:15.880 --> 08:18.840]  but maybe not so much of interest to people on the outside,
[08:18.840 --> 08:23.000]  but maybe not, but anyway.
[08:23.000 --> 08:26.100]  It's always, it's definitely interesting to.
[08:26.100 --> 08:26.940]  I'll just say this.
[08:26.940 --> 08:30.040]  Jim kept us, the members of the deck, up to date.
[08:30.040 --> 08:31.360]  We've known for the last year
[08:31.360 --> 08:33.440]  that the last year has not been good,
[08:33.440 --> 08:37.200]  and so there were a couple people who were worried
[08:37.200 --> 08:39.840]  that maybe this thing came as a surprise to me
[08:39.840 --> 08:41.800]  or everybody else in the deck,
[08:41.800 --> 08:43.320]  and it wasn't a surprise at all.
[08:43.320 --> 08:45.320]  We knew that it might be coming to an end
[08:46.720 --> 08:48.400]  from six, seven months ago,
[08:48.400 --> 08:50.240]  and then Jim let us know,
[08:50.240 --> 08:51.720]  I think it was early February even,
[08:51.720 --> 08:53.760]  that, hey, end of March is it.
[08:58.120 --> 08:59.880]  What I was gonna say is it's,
[08:59.880 --> 09:02.160]  there's definitely an industry of people
[09:02.160 --> 09:05.680]  who are super curious about how small
[09:05.680 --> 09:07.400]  or independent publishers operate,
[09:07.400 --> 09:11.620]  but especially as a former independent publisher,
[09:11.620 --> 09:14.560]  you never want that to be the most attention you get
[09:14.560 --> 09:16.680]  is when you're talking about yourself.
[09:16.680 --> 09:19.440]  You always want your work to get the most attention,
[09:19.440 --> 09:22.200]  and even though it's sometimes fun
[09:22.200 --> 09:25.560]  and interesting to talk about the operational elements
[09:25.560 --> 09:30.100]  of what you do and what the industry does,
[09:30.100 --> 09:31.740]  it definitely feels weird
[09:31.740 --> 09:33.600]  when that's where you're getting the most attention,
[09:33.600 --> 09:36.480]  so I understand.
[09:36.480 --> 09:37.320]  And you're right.
[09:37.320 --> 09:40.600]  I mean, podcasting is one of the areas
[09:40.600 --> 09:44.720]  where online money is going that's not social or Google,
[09:44.720 --> 09:45.700]  and it's growing.
[09:45.700 --> 09:48.840]  I mean, the demand for spots on this show
[09:48.840 --> 09:50.600]  is higher than ever.
[09:50.600 --> 09:52.000]  I forget how far ahead we're sold out,
[09:52.000 --> 09:53.360]  but probably too far even.
[09:54.840 --> 09:55.680]  And that's great.
[09:55.680 --> 09:58.320]  You know, I mean too far in the sense of.
[09:58.320 --> 09:59.240]  Let's play two.
[09:59.240 --> 10:01.880]  Right, in my theory on selling sponsorships,
[10:01.880 --> 10:04.600]  if you sell too far ahead, your rate's too low.
[10:04.600 --> 10:06.480]  You should raise the rate, you know,
[10:06.480 --> 10:11.480]  the calculus of how high the price per spot is
[10:11.760 --> 10:13.640]  and versus how far ahead you're sold
[10:13.640 --> 10:16.800]  is a tricky business, but if you're, you know,
[10:16.800 --> 10:17.640]  you don't wanna sell,
[10:17.640 --> 10:19.640]  you certainly don't wanna sell out two years ahead
[10:19.640 --> 10:21.880]  and have, you know, 100 weeks of shows
[10:21.880 --> 10:23.120]  sold out at the current rate.
[10:23.120 --> 10:24.280]  That means you, you know,
[10:24.280 --> 10:25.480]  you should've raised the rate
[10:25.480 --> 10:27.180]  for the ones in the future higher.
[10:29.080 --> 10:29.920]  Totally.
[10:29.920 --> 10:32.880]  You know, it's not doom and gloom for Daring Fireball,
[10:32.880 --> 10:34.320]  the Daring Fireball company.
[10:36.080 --> 10:39.400]  It's just, I think, a sad day for web advertising, period,
[10:39.400 --> 10:42.160]  simply because I think the deck did it right
[10:42.160 --> 10:45.240]  and what's left is not so good.
[10:45.240 --> 10:46.080]  So.
[10:47.400 --> 10:48.360]  Yeah, so what are you gonna do?
[10:48.360 --> 10:50.200]  Just gonna leave an empty spot there?
[10:50.200 --> 10:52.440]  I guess come April 1st, yeah.
[10:54.080 --> 10:56.840]  I don't know, I've been thinking about it a lot.
[10:56.840 --> 11:01.840]  I mean, as I want to do, I'm indecisive
[11:02.720 --> 11:05.240]  as to what to do with that.
[11:06.440 --> 11:07.280]  You know what I did?
[11:07.280 --> 11:09.680]  Well, I do not recommend the first part of this.
[11:09.680 --> 11:11.360]  The first thing I did was learn how to use
[11:11.360 --> 11:15.320]  DoubleClick for publishers, which is Google's ad server.
[11:15.320 --> 11:17.560]  Try to avoid doing that if you can.
[11:17.560 --> 11:19.600]  But back in the day when I was running Splat F
[11:19.600 --> 11:24.220]  and I had an ad network that did not have a 100% fill rate,
[11:24.220 --> 11:27.180]  I made a bunch of house ads that were super minimalist,
[11:27.180 --> 11:31.360]  clean ads, and they were actually for Amazon affiliate links
[11:31.360 --> 11:32.760]  to products I liked.
[11:32.760 --> 11:37.280]  So I linked to my favorite pen, this Pilot Ballpoint pen,
[11:37.280 --> 11:39.760]  and I linked to, I don't know, some other random stuff,
[11:39.760 --> 11:41.980]  probably the new MacBook Pro.
[11:43.400 --> 11:47.960]  And people bought some pens, and I think I sold some books,
[11:47.960 --> 11:51.200]  but it probably would have been nicer
[11:51.200 --> 11:52.800]  just to leave that space empty.
[11:53.840 --> 11:55.160]  I've thought about that.
[11:55.160 --> 11:58.680]  I mean, picking out things from Amazon
[11:58.680 --> 12:02.200]  and using this bot to promote something like that
[12:02.200 --> 12:04.740]  is a possibility.
[12:04.740 --> 12:09.160]  There was a time when I made, again,
[12:09.160 --> 12:11.340]  my strategy from the beginning was,
[12:11.340 --> 12:14.480]  maybe the stool analogy is a little broken
[12:14.480 --> 12:17.500]  because stools usually only have three or four legs,
[12:17.500 --> 12:20.120]  and the legs have to all be the same size,
[12:20.120 --> 12:22.680]  or the stool isn't balanced.
[12:24.540 --> 12:26.120]  But I'll stick with that analogy.
[12:26.120 --> 12:29.200]  My theory from the beginning was to have,
[12:29.200 --> 12:32.280]  don't depend on one source of revenue to run the site
[12:32.280 --> 12:34.880]  because if something goes wrong with it, you're screwed.
[12:34.880 --> 12:36.320]  It's healthier to,
[12:36.320 --> 12:38.600]  I think this is just common business sense.
[12:38.600 --> 12:41.640]  It's healthier to have multiple revenue streams.
[12:41.640 --> 12:43.280]  And at one point, like 10 years ago,
[12:43.280 --> 12:46.000]  in the early days of me going full-time on Daring Firebolt,
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.760]  Amazon affiliate revenue was,
[12:48.760 --> 12:53.760]  it was never the highest, but it was noticeable.
[12:54.160 --> 12:57.880]  It was, wow, this is worth doing
[12:57.880 --> 12:59.840]  in terms of how much money it makes per month.
[12:59.840 --> 13:04.060]  And there were bursts around December
[13:04.060 --> 13:06.480]  because I'd be purposefully linked
[13:06.480 --> 13:10.080]  to a couple of Christmas-y type things.
[13:10.080 --> 13:13.040]  And what happens, I don't even know
[13:13.040 --> 13:13.880]  if it works this way anymore,
[13:13.880 --> 13:16.320]  but at least it used to is,
[13:16.320 --> 13:17.880]  if you link to something at Amazon
[13:17.880 --> 13:21.040]  with your affiliate code, you get more
[13:21.040 --> 13:23.440]  if they buy that exact product that you link to.
[13:24.420 --> 13:28.380]  But whatever else they buy at Amazon,
[13:28.380 --> 13:32.200]  until they next click some other affiliate's affiliate code,
[13:32.200 --> 13:37.360]  you get the affiliate revenue from that, too.
[13:37.360 --> 13:39.220]  And so at Christmas, if somebody was like,
[13:39.220 --> 13:40.800]  oh, I'll help Daring Firebolt out.
[13:40.800 --> 13:44.000]  I'll click this link where I would say,
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.120]  hey, in parentheses, I get a kickback from Amazon
[13:47.120 --> 13:49.120]  if you click this link, blah, blah, blah.
[13:50.900 --> 13:53.480]  If people then did Christmas shopping and bought other stuff
[13:53.480 --> 13:57.280]  it was occasionally a pretty good amount of money.
[13:57.280 --> 13:58.680]  And because it's percentage-based,
[13:58.680 --> 14:00.720]  if people did stuff like buy a MacBook,
[14:00.720 --> 14:02.180]  it was a lot of money.
[14:05.820 --> 14:06.800]  I think it's a little different now,
[14:06.800 --> 14:07.760]  but yeah, same idea.
[14:07.760 --> 14:11.680]  If you link to one thing, you get the whole shopping cart.
[14:11.680 --> 14:12.560]  I think I'd miss. That was great.
[14:12.560 --> 14:16.560]  I actually remember linking to my wedding registry
[14:16.560 --> 14:18.120]  with my affiliate link.
[14:18.120 --> 14:21.240]  So not only did I get an extra commission
[14:21.240 --> 14:22.840]  on the gifts people were buying me,
[14:22.840 --> 14:26.020]  but I could see ahead of time what was coming.
[14:26.020 --> 14:30.680]  That was pretty good.
[14:30.680 --> 14:33.360]  I think I mentioned this on this show,
[14:33.360 --> 14:35.400]  I forget, a couple of weeks ago with somebody.
[14:35.400 --> 14:36.560]  I don't remember exactly.
[14:36.560 --> 14:39.600]  But the funny part, though, is if I wanted to do that,
[14:39.600 --> 14:42.240]  I've got to get in touch with Amazon
[14:42.240 --> 14:47.000]  and reinstate my affiliate account.
[14:47.000 --> 14:50.920]  They unceremoniously shut my affiliate account down
[14:50.920 --> 14:52.920]  in October.
[14:52.920 --> 14:54.200]  Yikes.
[14:54.200 --> 14:55.520]  Oh, right, I remember that.
[14:55.520 --> 14:57.200]  Did you ever figure that out?
[14:57.200 --> 15:01.000]  No, because I've been wavering on whether I
[15:01.000 --> 15:05.500]  want to write about it.
[15:05.500 --> 15:08.160]  Because to me, it's sort of an interesting story.
[15:08.160 --> 15:10.240]  But on the other hand, writing about it
[15:10.240 --> 15:18.320]  also feels like I'm pulling the special, you know.
[15:18.320 --> 15:20.280]  It's obviously going to get a lot of publicity
[15:20.280 --> 15:22.520]  if I write, look what Amazon did to me.
[15:22.520 --> 15:27.400]  They unceremoniously dumped me.
[15:27.400 --> 15:29.600]  But I still think it's kind of an interesting story.
[15:29.600 --> 15:30.920]  I've never heard of this before.
[15:30.920 --> 15:33.460]  So for anybody who didn't listen to the previous episode here,
[15:33.460 --> 15:35.240]  I just looked up the email.
[15:35.240 --> 15:37.600]  On October 11, I got an email from Amazon Associates
[15:37.600 --> 15:39.480]  that said, your Associates account has come up
[15:39.480 --> 15:42.560]  for review in connection with our ongoing monitoring
[15:42.560 --> 15:44.160]  of the Amazon Affiliates Program.
[15:44.160 --> 15:46.480]  During our review, we have determined
[15:46.480 --> 15:49.300]  that you are not in compliance with the operating agreement
[15:49.300 --> 15:51.760]  that governs your participation in the Associates Program.
[15:51.760 --> 15:55.960]  When your Associates Program account has been closed,
[15:55.960 --> 15:59.380]  you will not receive further payment of advertising fees.
[15:59.380 --> 16:01.120]  You are not in compliance, because you
[16:01.120 --> 16:04.060]  are encouraging customers to bookmark your Amazon links,
[16:04.060 --> 16:06.600]  as opposed to clicking through your website to reach Amazon.
[16:06.600 --> 16:09.320]  This is not the intent of the Associates Program.
[16:09.320 --> 16:10.860]  Section 7 of the operating agreement
[16:10.860 --> 16:12.800]  states that a qualifying purchase
[16:12.800 --> 16:15.400]  occurs when a customer clicks through a special link
[16:15.400 --> 16:18.000]  on your site to the Amazon site.
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.520]  Purchases resulting from clicks through bookmarked links
[16:20.520 --> 16:22.760]  do not fit this criteria.
[16:22.760 --> 16:26.200]  You can find the terms, and there's a link to their terms.
[16:26.200 --> 16:29.400]  We ask that you immediately remove all Amazon content
[16:29.400 --> 16:30.800]  from your sites.
[16:30.800 --> 16:33.520]  Any other accounts you have or may open in the future
[16:33.520 --> 16:37.320]  may be closed, and you will not receive any advertising fees.
[16:37.320 --> 16:40.880]  We reserve all other rights and claims we have.
[16:40.880 --> 16:45.240]  We appreciate your understanding in this matter.
[16:45.240 --> 16:49.680]  Warmest regards, amazon.com.
[16:49.680 --> 16:51.800]  That's my favorite, warmest regards.
[16:51.800 --> 16:53.280]  There's your headline right there.
[16:53.280 --> 16:55.040]  So the thing that's interesting about this
[16:55.040 --> 16:57.360]  is they never point to anywhere on my site
[16:57.360 --> 17:03.760]  where I've done this, encouraged people to bookmark it.
[17:03.760 --> 17:06.880]  So it doesn't say, hey, on this page,
[17:06.880 --> 17:09.280]  you encourage people to bookmark it.
[17:09.280 --> 17:16.240]  There's no opportunity to edit the page, to remove that.
[17:16.240 --> 17:18.280]  And there's absolutely no recourse here.
[17:18.280 --> 17:20.480]  There's no, if you, you know.
[17:20.480 --> 17:25.920]  And that day, my Amazon account was shut down.
[17:25.920 --> 17:28.080]  There's no, you know, here's where
[17:28.080 --> 17:32.360]  you go if you want to appeal, if you want to argue about this.
[17:32.360 --> 17:34.440]  Just gone.
[17:34.440 --> 17:36.800]  And one of the things that I think is funny about this
[17:36.800 --> 17:38.920]  is that people think that the App Store from Apple
[17:38.920 --> 17:42.320]  is capricious in the way they deal with people.
[17:42.320 --> 17:46.240]  But I've never heard of anything like this.
[17:46.240 --> 17:47.040]  Weird, right?
[17:47.040 --> 17:47.840]  Yeah, that's nuts.
[17:47.840 --> 17:50.600]  I'm actually surprised you haven't, just
[17:50.600 --> 17:53.000]  through the popularity of your podcast,
[17:53.000 --> 17:54.920]  gotten that resolved by now.
[17:54.920 --> 17:56.680]  Yeah, I don't know.
[17:56.680 --> 17:59.080]  Anyway, I think I know what site it was.
[17:59.080 --> 18:02.600]  I think I know what web page it was.
[18:02.600 --> 18:08.040]  It's a post I wrote in December of 2004.
[18:08.040 --> 18:10.400]  I swear to God, I'm almost sure this is it.
[18:10.400 --> 18:12.840]  Because I literally do tell people
[18:12.840 --> 18:16.200]  that they can bookmark my affiliate code.
[18:16.200 --> 18:18.600]  I wrote, if you're going to purchase holiday gifts
[18:18.600 --> 18:20.760]  at Amazon and you'd like to support during Fireball,
[18:20.760 --> 18:22.560]  please consider using these links
[18:22.560 --> 18:23.880]  to get to Amazon's website.
[18:23.880 --> 18:26.520]  After clicking, you'll proceed to Amazon's home page,
[18:26.520 --> 18:27.200]  blah, blah, blah.
[18:30.840 --> 18:34.200]  So it was like a 12-year-old post that suddenly, I don't
[18:34.200 --> 18:36.480]  know, I guess they probably had like a spider or something
[18:36.480 --> 18:39.080]  that found it.
[18:39.080 --> 18:39.960]  Or an intern.
[18:39.960 --> 18:41.120]  Yeah, I don't know.
[18:41.120 --> 18:42.400]  Amazing.
[18:42.400 --> 18:43.880]  Yeah, but I don't know.
[18:43.880 --> 18:46.960]  But the other reason I didn't take any action immediately
[18:46.960 --> 18:50.560]  is I've, in recent years, stopped really
[18:50.560 --> 18:52.280]  using the affiliates code.
[18:52.280 --> 18:57.560]  Because I've been a little bit uncomfortable.
[18:57.560 --> 19:01.040]  Because Amazon has, since 2004, whenever
[19:01.040 --> 19:03.120]  I joined the affiliate program, has
[19:03.120 --> 19:06.600]  become a lot less of just an online store
[19:06.600 --> 19:10.000]  and a lot more of one of the leading players
[19:10.000 --> 19:13.160]  in the industry I write about.
[19:13.160 --> 19:15.880]  And so I don't know.
[19:15.880 --> 19:17.000]  There's all sorts of sites.
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.440]  I mean, the New York Times bought the Wirecutter,
[19:19.440 --> 19:23.160]  which runs on affiliate links.
[19:23.160 --> 19:29.720]  I don't think it's unseemly, but it also just seems to me
[19:29.720 --> 19:32.200]  like it's cleaner if I just don't even
[19:32.200 --> 19:34.600]  use the affiliate link.
[19:34.600 --> 19:37.360]  So I haven't been using it in recent years.
[19:37.360 --> 19:40.920]  And the money I get from it has been, at one point,
[19:40.920 --> 19:42.720]  it was like hundreds of dollars a month
[19:42.720 --> 19:46.160]  and maybe like a couple of thousand around the holidays.
[19:46.160 --> 19:49.640]  And in recent years, it's just been like, I don't know,
[19:49.640 --> 19:53.840]  $15 a month or something like that.
[19:53.840 --> 19:56.240]  Yeah, it's one thing to say, here
[19:56.240 --> 19:59.960]  are all the new Kindles and an affiliate link,
[19:59.960 --> 20:01.600]  and then three minutes later criticize
[20:01.600 --> 20:06.560]  the company for a practice of one of its HR practices
[20:06.560 --> 20:08.160]  or something like that.
[20:08.160 --> 20:17.040]  Or if I say something really good about a book or a Kindle
[20:17.040 --> 20:20.800]  or something like that and include the code,
[20:20.800 --> 20:25.720]  it's easier to say that, look, I'm telling you this is good
[20:25.720 --> 20:29.640]  because it's good if there is no affiliate code.
[20:29.640 --> 20:32.200]  And I'm not saying that people who include it
[20:32.200 --> 20:34.560]  are doing something unethical.
[20:34.560 --> 20:38.640]  And I think that in the long run, the wire cutter
[20:38.640 --> 20:41.480]  gets by in the long run because it's their long-term reputation
[20:41.480 --> 20:42.120]  that matters.
[20:42.120 --> 20:46.640]  If the wire cutter tells you to buy a certain blender
[20:46.640 --> 20:48.760]  and you get it through an Amazon link
[20:48.760 --> 20:51.440]  and they get $3 from their purchase
[20:51.440 --> 20:55.720]  and then you get the blender and it's a piece of junk,
[20:55.720 --> 20:58.320]  the wire cutter suffers from that because you're not
[20:58.320 --> 21:05.200]  going to trust them in the future.
[21:05.200 --> 21:08.400]  The post, I have it in the show notes already,
[21:08.400 --> 21:09.240]  so it'll be there.
[21:09.240 --> 21:11.920]  It's this Amazon debauchery, I don't even
[21:11.920 --> 21:16.120]  know how to pronounce that word, but I used it, post from 2004.
[21:16.120 --> 21:19.960]  And among the links in the post is the 20-gigabyte iPod U2
[21:19.960 --> 21:22.240]  special edition.
[21:22.240 --> 21:24.160]  Wow.
[21:24.160 --> 21:24.960]  Nice.
[21:24.960 --> 21:28.320]  One of the things about writing about the deck yesterday
[21:28.320 --> 21:30.640]  and thinking about it and going back and looking
[21:30.640 --> 21:34.720]  at my old posts about the early years and the early years
[21:34.720 --> 21:37.360]  of sponsorships and advertising on Daring Fireball is it
[21:37.360 --> 21:40.760]  really, A, it was a rabbit hole and I lost a lot of time
[21:40.760 --> 21:43.400]  rereading 10-year-old posts on my own site.
[21:43.400 --> 21:47.700]  But B, a lot of them just gave me that feeling of, holy shit,
[21:47.700 --> 21:49.800]  it's been a long time.
[21:49.800 --> 21:55.400]  The U2 hard drive iPod feels like another era.
[21:55.400 --> 21:59.600]  I mean, that really, that was a long time ago.
[21:59.600 --> 22:01.400]  What do you think of that new red iPhone?
[22:01.400 --> 22:03.200]  Well, let's hold that thought and we'll
[22:03.200 --> 22:07.520]  talk about that after I talk about one of our friends.
[22:07.520 --> 22:11.160]  This show is brought to you by Jamf Now.
[22:11.160 --> 22:16.680]  Jamf Software, J-A-M-F. They've got a product called Jamf Now,
[22:16.680 --> 22:20.000]  and it helps you manage your Apple devices from anywhere.
[22:20.000 --> 22:20.940]  When you first start your business,
[22:20.940 --> 22:23.840]  it's pretty easy to keep track of your own computer and phone.
[22:23.840 --> 22:24.640]  That's where I am.
[22:24.640 --> 22:26.880]  I'm just one person, so it's pretty easy.
[22:26.880 --> 22:29.200]  I've got two Macs and an iPhone.
[22:29.200 --> 22:31.740]  But as your business grows and you start to buy more tech
[22:31.740 --> 22:33.120]  for your employees, it gets harder
[22:33.120 --> 22:36.640]  to keep track of everyone's Macs, iPhones, and iPads.
[22:36.640 --> 22:40.760]  Figuring out how to secure the iPad that your sales rep lost
[22:40.760 --> 22:42.440]  can be tough, especially when you're
[22:42.440 --> 22:43.560]  all in different locations.
[22:43.560 --> 22:46.440]  In a lot of small businesses now, everybody works remotely.
[22:46.440 --> 22:51.680]  Jamf Now makes that and a lot more easy.
[22:51.680 --> 22:54.720]  You can configure settings, protect sensitive information,
[22:54.720 --> 22:58.200]  even lock or wipe a device from anywhere.
[22:58.200 --> 23:02.640]  Jamf Now secures your stuff so you can focus on your business.
[23:02.640 --> 23:04.520]  No IT expertise needed.
[23:04.520 --> 23:06.280]  You don't need to have an IT department
[23:06.280 --> 23:08.760]  to manage your devices for a small company.
[23:08.760 --> 23:11.280]  Jamf Now makes it so anybody can do it.
[23:11.280 --> 23:15.920]  Talk show listeners can start securing their business today
[23:15.920 --> 23:19.880]  by setting up the first three devices for free.
[23:19.880 --> 23:23.960]  Add more for just $2 a month per device.
[23:23.960 --> 23:26.400]  $2 a month per device, what a great price
[23:26.400 --> 23:31.120]  for an absolutely fantastic bit of management software.
[23:31.120 --> 23:34.360]  Create your free account at jamf, J-A-M-F,
[23:34.360 --> 23:37.920]  dot com slash the talk show.
[23:37.920 --> 23:42.800]  That's J-A-M-F dot com slash the talk show.
[23:42.800 --> 23:45.520]  Yeah, let's talk about the new Apple stuff.
[23:45.520 --> 23:46.480]  Do you have any of it?
[23:46.480 --> 23:47.920]  I have a red iPhone.
[23:47.920 --> 23:51.800]  I did get a little briefing up in New York
[23:51.800 --> 23:54.360]  from some fine folks at Apple.
[23:54.360 --> 23:56.280]  Oh, the 17-inch iPad?
[23:56.280 --> 23:57.320]  No, no, no.
[23:57.320 --> 23:59.160]  There was nothing secret like that.
[23:59.160 --> 24:01.920]  And they did not give me a review unit,
[24:01.920 --> 24:06.960]  which I was hoping they would not, of the 9.7-inch iPad.
[24:06.960 --> 24:12.360]  Because I've got too many review units.
[24:12.360 --> 24:14.040]  There's nothing I don't know about it.
[24:14.040 --> 24:15.560]  I don't need to use it to get it.
[24:15.560 --> 24:18.000]  They had them there for me to examine and look at.
[24:18.000 --> 24:19.080]  And they're fine products.
[24:19.080 --> 24:21.600]  But they did give me a review unit of the red iPhone.
[24:21.600 --> 24:23.760]  It's quite nice.
[24:23.760 --> 24:25.960]  How's the texture on that?
[24:25.960 --> 24:29.960]  It feels to me exactly like the black one.
[24:29.960 --> 24:32.360]  And I don't have, actually, I just
[24:32.360 --> 24:37.200]  packed it up to send back, but the black one.
[24:37.200 --> 24:40.400]  I don't have the silver or gold.
[24:40.400 --> 24:41.600]  But it feels about the same.
[24:41.600 --> 24:42.920]  I think blindfolded, I would not be
[24:42.920 --> 24:45.200]  able to tell the difference between the red one
[24:45.200 --> 24:49.400]  and the other non-jet black iPhones.
[24:52.600 --> 24:55.480]  I personally feel that it would look better with a black face
[24:55.480 --> 24:57.320]  than the white face.
[24:57.320 --> 24:58.880]  And I wrote that on Daring Fireball.
[24:58.880 --> 25:01.720]  And I got a ton of responses.
[25:01.720 --> 25:05.000]  And everybody feels very strongly about the matter.
[25:05.000 --> 25:06.560]  But a lot of people feel very strongly
[25:06.560 --> 25:08.120]  that I'm exactly right.
[25:08.120 --> 25:10.080]  And what is wrong with Apple?
[25:10.080 --> 25:10.920]  Are they blind?
[25:10.920 --> 25:13.760]  Why wouldn't they make this phone with a black face?
[25:13.760 --> 25:15.880]  And the other half are very strong,
[25:15.880 --> 25:18.480]  saying, oh my god, no, this is beautiful exactly as it is.
[25:18.480 --> 25:21.800]  Don't encourage them to change a thing.
[25:21.800 --> 25:24.360]  I've never had a white iPhone.
[25:24.360 --> 25:27.680]  And I don't think I'd ever want one.
[25:27.680 --> 25:29.600]  It seems like an unnecessary distraction
[25:29.600 --> 25:31.840]  when you're trying to just see the screen.
[25:31.840 --> 25:33.800]  Yeah, for me, that's exactly how I feel.
[25:33.800 --> 25:37.000]  Well, A, my general rule is when in doubt,
[25:37.000 --> 25:42.040]  buying anything, if there's a black option, get it in black.
[25:42.040 --> 25:44.840]  I just live by that motto.
[25:44.840 --> 25:45.720]  I have a black car.
[25:49.840 --> 25:54.760]  I just generally buy stuff in black.
[25:54.760 --> 25:58.680]  But for that reason, I've had review unit iPhones
[25:58.680 --> 26:01.560]  that are white, white face, like with a gold background
[26:01.560 --> 26:03.040]  or something like that.
[26:03.040 --> 26:07.040]  And I don't hate it, but I do feel that it distracts,
[26:07.040 --> 26:08.760]  because when the screen's off, you can see
[26:08.760 --> 26:11.320]  exactly where the screen is.
[26:11.320 --> 26:14.280]  You've got this white thing and then a black thing within it,
[26:14.280 --> 26:17.600]  whereas when the black phone is off, it's just a black thing.
[26:21.040 --> 26:23.000]  It's great if you're trying to watch a video
[26:23.000 --> 26:23.960]  on a dark airplane.
[26:23.960 --> 26:31.760]  Why would you want a weird white frame around the screen?
[26:31.760 --> 26:33.320]  But obviously, they're very popular.
[26:33.320 --> 26:36.040]  So I mean, there's no accounting for taste.
[26:36.040 --> 26:38.720]  But I would point that out as a good use.
[26:38.720 --> 26:40.560]  There's a reason why it doesn't seem to me
[26:40.560 --> 26:45.120]  like anybody makes white-framed televisions.
[26:45.120 --> 26:46.880]  To me, it's unnecessarily distracting,
[26:46.880 --> 26:48.560]  but it is what it is.
[26:48.560 --> 26:50.560]  But anyway, I think that this red in particular
[26:50.560 --> 26:52.000]  would look good with a black front.
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.480]  I've also thought, though, I've been saying this for years.
[26:54.480 --> 26:56.680]  I mean, and again, it might just be that I just
[26:56.680 --> 26:58.600]  like black over white anyway.
[26:58.600 --> 27:01.680]  But I think that the gold tones would look good
[27:01.680 --> 27:06.360]  with a black front, sort of a Pittsburgh Steelers look.
[27:06.360 --> 27:09.120]  I would definitely buy the silver stuff
[27:09.120 --> 27:14.480]  if it had a black front too, whatever it's called these days.
[27:14.480 --> 27:17.720]  I bought the aluminum, the main silver-colored MacBook
[27:17.720 --> 27:18.600]  the last two years.
[27:18.600 --> 27:21.640]  And it's great with the black screen frame.
[27:21.640 --> 27:25.480]  But if it had a white screen frame, no thanks.
[27:25.480 --> 27:26.600]  Did you see the thing?
[27:26.600 --> 27:30.160]  I didn't bother to do my homework.
[27:30.160 --> 27:35.120]  But there's a thing where it's obviously product red.
[27:35.120 --> 27:41.120]  And so the proceeds go to help fight AIDS in Africa,
[27:41.120 --> 27:46.760]  except that in China, it's not a product red product.
[27:46.760 --> 27:49.760]  But I heard somewhere somebody said
[27:49.760 --> 27:53.840]  that even though it's not marketed as product red,
[27:53.840 --> 27:57.000]  Apple still is going to send the same portion of the proceeds
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.840]  from the red one sold in China to product red.
[27:59.840 --> 28:01.560]  So I don't know what the deal is there.
[28:01.560 --> 28:04.160]  It might just be, I don't know if that's true or not true.
[28:04.160 --> 28:06.840]  And if it is true, I don't know why
[28:06.840 --> 28:08.800]  they don't stamp product red on it.
[28:08.800 --> 28:11.120]  But there's a lot of people who think
[28:11.120 --> 28:13.080]  that the main target for this phone
[28:13.080 --> 28:17.600]  is China, just because red is such a popular color in China.
[28:17.600 --> 28:21.800]  It's the most popular color by far.
[28:21.800 --> 28:24.840]  I can't recall a time when Apple made something
[28:24.840 --> 28:29.400]  that specific red, and it wasn't a product red co-branded thing
[28:29.400 --> 28:29.920]  either.
[28:29.920 --> 28:30.480]  No.
[28:30.480 --> 28:32.800]  I guess maybe the U2 iPod.
[28:32.800 --> 28:35.360]  No, because that was before, I think, product red existed.
[28:35.360 --> 28:37.160]  Everything that has always been product red.
[28:37.160 --> 28:42.120]  I think even the old iPods.
[28:42.120 --> 28:44.320]  Yeah, I think they just do it, because I
[28:44.320 --> 28:46.780]  don't know what percentage of the money goes to product red.
[28:46.780 --> 28:50.240]  But whatever it is, it's within their whatever they want to,
[28:50.240 --> 28:54.480]  they want to give that amount to product red anyway.
[28:54.480 --> 28:59.280]  Even little rinky-dink things like the red iPhone cases
[28:59.280 --> 29:01.640]  are product red.
[29:01.640 --> 29:06.160]  Or if you buy the sports strap for your Apple Watch that's
[29:06.160 --> 29:07.840]  red, it's product red.
[29:07.840 --> 29:09.080]  So it must just be something.
[29:09.080 --> 29:10.320]  I don't know if it's a legal thing in China
[29:10.320 --> 29:12.200]  or if it's a marketing thing in China, where
[29:12.200 --> 29:15.000]  they feel like, marketing-wise, that wouldn't
[29:15.000 --> 29:16.440]  go over well for some reason.
[29:16.440 --> 29:17.360]  Yeah, it's interesting.
[29:17.360 --> 29:18.920]  I don't know.
[29:18.920 --> 29:20.480]  Could be both.
[29:20.480 --> 29:21.440]  What else did they do?
[29:21.440 --> 29:22.800]  My guess is it's probably a legal thing, but.
[29:22.800 --> 29:23.400]  Yeah, maybe.
[29:23.400 --> 29:24.200]  That's what I think, too.
[29:24.200 --> 29:27.000]  I don't know why China would be different than every other
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.360]  non-US entity, so I don't know.
[29:30.360 --> 29:34.760]  They also, they minor tweak to the iPhone SE,
[29:34.760 --> 29:39.520]  where they changed it from a 16 or 64-gigabyte
[29:39.520 --> 29:45.080]  storage-tier option to 32 and 128, which.
[29:45.080 --> 29:46.880]  Unironic, finally.
[29:46.880 --> 29:50.240]  Yeah, no more 16-gigabyte iPhones.
[29:50.240 --> 29:52.280]  No more 16-gigabyte iPads, either.
[29:52.280 --> 29:53.640]  I think the last, there is still,
[29:53.640 --> 29:55.480]  you can still buy a 16-gigabyte iPod Touch,
[29:55.480 --> 30:00.240]  but does anybody buy iPod Touches anymore?
[30:00.240 --> 30:01.840]  I guess some people do for kids, but.
[30:04.640 --> 30:06.520]  Not even Syracuse, though, so I don't know.
[30:06.520 --> 30:08.000]  Yeah.
[30:08.000 --> 30:09.520]  But that's a nice thing.
[30:09.520 --> 30:13.640]  But it also strongly suggests that they're not
[30:13.640 --> 30:18.240]  going to update the iPhone SE, other than the storage.
[30:18.240 --> 30:21.240]  You know, I think it's the last of the phones of that size.
[30:24.160 --> 30:26.840]  I tweeted this yesterday, or maybe the day before.
[30:26.840 --> 30:28.200]  I said, I miss Mark Gurman.
[30:28.200 --> 30:32.720]  But for real, I want to know why there's no new iPad
[30:32.720 --> 30:35.640]  Pros, because that seemed like the main function
[30:35.640 --> 30:39.480]  of the spring rev cycle now, and we don't have it.
[30:39.480 --> 30:41.400]  Just as I was about to impulse purchase
[30:41.400 --> 30:46.680]  a mid-sized iPad Pro with a pencil,
[30:46.680 --> 30:48.040]  I was hoping for an update.
[30:48.040 --> 30:51.000]  And now it seems like it's not happening.
[30:51.000 --> 30:55.200]  There were a lot of the supply chain rumors for months,
[30:55.200 --> 30:57.840]  I mean, dating back to August, were saying
[30:57.840 --> 31:00.760]  that there's going to be, I guess some of them
[31:00.760 --> 31:04.360]  didn't say an iPad Pro, a 9.7-inch iPad Pro.
[31:04.360 --> 31:07.360]  Some of the rumors did say that there was a low-cost 9.7-inch
[31:07.360 --> 31:08.680]  iPad coming in March.
[31:08.680 --> 31:13.560]  But they all said that there was an updated 12.9-inch iPad
[31:13.560 --> 31:15.120]  Pro coming for March.
[31:15.120 --> 31:17.480]  And I thought it just made common sense,
[31:17.480 --> 31:19.720]  like not talking to little birdies or anything,
[31:19.720 --> 31:22.760]  but just, you know, Apple is a company of patterns.
[31:22.760 --> 31:25.680]  And they've had March new products for a while.
[31:25.680 --> 31:27.640]  They had March new products this year, too.
[31:27.640 --> 31:31.360]  And it just seemed like a year-old iPad Pro
[31:31.360 --> 31:36.840]  and a year-and-a-half-old big iPad Pro seemed due for updates.
[31:36.840 --> 31:40.080]  Especially with that Pro name, it seems.
[31:40.080 --> 31:42.240]  And some people are saying that it's still coming.
[31:42.240 --> 31:44.720]  There's somebody who said it's coming in an event in April.
[31:44.720 --> 31:46.960]  I don't think that that's going to happen at all.
[31:46.960 --> 31:47.800]  I don't know.
[31:47.800 --> 31:48.960]  But I mean, I could be wrong.
[31:48.960 --> 31:51.080]  But I don't think it's coming.
[31:51.080 --> 31:53.480]  So maybe a WWDC?
[31:53.480 --> 31:56.200]  But the other spring thing recently
[31:56.200 --> 31:59.720]  has been the MacBook, the 12-inch MacBook, which
[31:59.720 --> 32:02.400]  doesn't seem to have an update this spring either.
[32:02.400 --> 32:03.400]  Yeah.
[32:03.400 --> 32:04.080]  Maybe.
[32:04.080 --> 32:04.840]  Yeah, who knows?
[32:04.840 --> 32:06.320]  It seems like there's a couple of products
[32:06.320 --> 32:07.240]  that could be updated.
[32:07.240 --> 32:12.040]  And they aren't in the, oh my god,
[32:12.040 --> 32:13.960]  how old is the Mac Pro type era?
[32:13.960 --> 32:18.640]  Just products that we know Apple still cares very much about
[32:18.640 --> 32:20.280]  seem due for an update.
[32:20.280 --> 32:21.440]  But do you wait or not?
[32:21.440 --> 32:23.680]  Like, if you're in the market for an iPad Pro right now,
[32:23.680 --> 32:24.520]  what do you do?
[32:24.520 --> 32:26.360]  I'm waiting.
[32:26.360 --> 32:28.160]  I refuse to buy something.
[32:28.160 --> 32:29.320]  Oh, I don't know.
[32:29.320 --> 32:30.600]  Last night I almost bought one.
[32:30.600 --> 32:33.720]  But I think I have to wait.
[32:33.720 --> 32:35.240]  I think so, too, unless you have to.
[32:35.240 --> 32:37.200]  It's not going to be a whole other year.
[32:37.200 --> 32:38.840]  It's not like I really need it, right?
[32:38.840 --> 32:44.440]  This is like an impulse purchase, if anything.
[32:44.440 --> 32:47.680]  Yeah, I'm going to hold off, because whether they
[32:47.680 --> 32:53.960]  change the design of it or not, all those rumors of the 10
[32:53.960 --> 32:58.160]  whatever inch thing, it seems like it's probably not going
[32:58.160 --> 33:00.680]  to be an entire extra year.
[33:00.680 --> 33:03.760]  So I might as well hold off for whatever sort of speed
[33:03.760 --> 33:05.240]  bumps they put into it.
[33:05.240 --> 33:07.280]  Yeah, I don't know.
[33:07.280 --> 33:07.960]  It's hard to say.
[33:07.960 --> 33:08.480]  I don't know.
[33:08.480 --> 33:10.360]  It seems like all of the rumors are
[33:10.360 --> 33:11.640]  coming from the supply chain.
[33:11.640 --> 33:14.900]  And I do feel like if who knows where
[33:14.900 --> 33:16.120]  German sources have been.
[33:16.120 --> 33:18.880]  But it seems like in years past, German
[33:18.880 --> 33:25.240]  had sources from somehow not just from the supply chain.
[33:25.240 --> 33:29.960]  And the supply chain ones get all the product marketing wrong,
[33:29.960 --> 33:31.200]  because they don't know.
[33:31.200 --> 33:35.840]  All they know is somebody at a sharp display
[33:35.840 --> 33:43.040]  factory in China talks to Ming-Chi Kuo and tells him,
[33:43.040 --> 33:48.280]  hey, Apple is buying a ton of these 10.5 inch LCD panels.
[33:48.280 --> 33:49.920]  Go from there.
[33:49.920 --> 33:52.720]  But they don't know anything about what product it's for
[33:52.720 --> 33:53.640]  or anything like that.
[33:53.640 --> 33:55.700]  And it's obvious in hindsight that they
[33:55.700 --> 33:59.080]  don't know when the hell the products are coming out either.
[33:59.080 --> 34:01.440]  You know my favorite one of all time?
[34:01.440 --> 34:02.560]  Which is that?
[34:02.560 --> 34:05.080]  The naming, the iPhone math.
[34:09.640 --> 34:13.600]  Which I guess in hindsight was the iPhone 6 Plus.
[34:13.600 --> 34:17.880]  But they got the plus name right, but the iPhone math.
[34:17.880 --> 34:20.120]  Oh, I never thought about that.
[34:20.120 --> 34:21.360]  Every once in a while, I think about that
[34:21.360 --> 34:23.600]  and I just laugh my ass off walking down the street.
[34:23.600 --> 34:25.400]  iPhone math.
[34:25.400 --> 34:28.560]  I never thought about it, that that's
[34:28.560 --> 34:30.520]  what they saw the plus symbol.
[34:30.520 --> 34:33.400]  And who knows, maybe it was like a language thing too,
[34:33.400 --> 34:39.360]  where in Chinese or whatever language in Asia,
[34:39.360 --> 34:41.160]  if it was Korean or whatever, but there's
[34:41.160 --> 34:45.960]  some kind of translation from an Asian language to English,
[34:45.960 --> 34:50.400]  where plus, a number and a plus sign got turned into math.
[34:52.800 --> 34:55.520]  It's just the best.
[34:55.520 --> 34:56.720]  I don't know what to do.
[34:56.720 --> 34:57.760]  People often ask me.
[34:57.760 --> 35:01.760]  I feel like almost every product except the iPhone
[35:01.760 --> 35:03.800]  is getting harder and harder to predict
[35:03.800 --> 35:08.760]  when the hell Apple's going to come out with updates.
[35:08.760 --> 35:11.040]  Do you use an iPad Pro for anything?
[35:11.040 --> 35:13.240]  Right now, no.
[35:13.240 --> 35:16.720]  I never bought one, and I've packed up the ones.
[35:16.720 --> 35:20.720]  I've turned the review units that I've had.
[35:20.720 --> 35:22.120]  I regretted it.
[35:22.120 --> 35:24.280]  And then I thought, and my thinking was,
[35:24.280 --> 35:25.720]  I don't really use an iPad a lot.
[35:25.720 --> 35:28.560]  So that's an Apple device that I only buy one
[35:28.560 --> 35:29.480]  every couple of years.
[35:29.480 --> 35:35.440]  The iPad I'm using right now is an iPad Mini.
[35:35.440 --> 35:38.280]  And I don't even know what model it is.
[35:38.280 --> 35:40.440]  It's fairly recent.
[35:40.440 --> 35:42.680]  No, no, it's not that recent.
[35:42.680 --> 35:43.200]  I don't know.
[35:43.200 --> 35:45.200]  It's an iPad Mini from a couple of years ago.
[35:45.200 --> 35:46.640]  So I'm due to get a new one.
[35:46.640 --> 35:49.440]  I think I'm done with the iPad Mini size.
[35:49.440 --> 35:54.160]  I think I want the 9.7 inch size, just because I
[35:54.160 --> 35:55.520]  like having everything bigger.
[35:55.520 --> 35:57.480]  It's like the years since I've had this Mini,
[35:57.480 --> 36:00.880]  or the years where I'm starting to need bigger stuff
[36:00.880 --> 36:03.440]  to be able to read.
[36:03.440 --> 36:04.640]  But I don't want to buy now.
[36:04.640 --> 36:08.320]  And I don't use an iPad enough to be tempted at all
[36:08.320 --> 36:12.640]  to buy before they come out with the new ones.
[36:12.640 --> 36:14.680]  Yeah, same.
[36:14.680 --> 36:17.000]  I think it was a good move, and an interesting move
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.920]  that they went to move the price down,
[36:19.920 --> 36:25.000]  as opposed to maxing out any sort of specs on this new.
[36:25.000 --> 36:25.760]  Well, I think it's.
[36:25.760 --> 36:28.160]  Revision, but it makes total sense.
[36:28.160 --> 36:30.320]  It's clear that the two places they
[36:30.320 --> 36:32.720]  need to go with the iPad is they need lower prices,
[36:32.720 --> 36:34.560]  and that's what this product is all about.
[36:34.560 --> 36:36.720]  And they need to keep pushing the pro capabilities
[36:36.720 --> 36:39.680]  at the high end, because it runs from, hey,
[36:39.680 --> 36:43.720]  this is just a $300 thing for a classroom full of kids
[36:43.720 --> 36:45.800]  in elementary school to.
[36:45.800 --> 36:49.160]  Or any coffee shop with a square reader, which is, you know.
[36:49.160 --> 36:50.920]  Right, right, just to put like.
[36:50.920 --> 36:54.040]  Almost everyone I go into now, they're using an actual iPad
[36:54.040 --> 36:56.200]  as the point of sale stuff.
[36:56.200 --> 37:01.080]  Yeah, and it's only $300.
[37:01.080 --> 37:03.400]  It's super easy.
[37:03.400 --> 37:05.480]  It seems to me like every place I go into that uses them
[37:05.480 --> 37:07.920]  as a reader, they work very well.
[37:07.920 --> 37:08.480]  They're fast.
[37:12.640 --> 37:14.240]  But in cases like that, yeah, price
[37:14.240 --> 37:18.400]  is a bigger difference than power.
[37:18.400 --> 37:20.600]  I think they did a good job, too, of figuring out
[37:20.600 --> 37:23.440]  what are the things that are pro,
[37:23.440 --> 37:26.320]  and which are the things that are not.
[37:26.320 --> 37:28.080]  If there's anything I'm a little bit.
[37:28.080 --> 37:30.560]  I'm not surprised at all that it doesn't support the pencil,
[37:30.560 --> 37:33.600]  because the pencil, I can only imagine
[37:33.600 --> 37:36.480]  that the support inside the iPad for the pencil
[37:36.480 --> 37:40.680]  is relatively expensive, that it's not super cheap.
[37:40.680 --> 37:43.200]  And the pencil itself isn't cheap.
[37:43.200 --> 37:46.640]  And so I don't think schools, for example,
[37:46.640 --> 37:49.000]  elementary schools that are so price sensitive,
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.120]  and we're hearing so much that they're
[37:51.120 --> 37:53.000]  more price sensitive than ever.
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.160]  They're not going to buy Apple Pencils for the kids,
[37:55.160 --> 37:58.240]  because surely they're going to get lost.
[37:58.240 --> 38:03.200]  Snapped, maybe stolen, who knows.
[38:03.200 --> 38:04.520]  So I don't think pencils support.
[38:04.520 --> 38:05.280]  Keep that for pro.
[38:05.280 --> 38:08.920]  You can use a dumb stylus with a regular iPad if you need to.
[38:08.920 --> 38:11.160]  Right.
[38:11.160 --> 38:14.440]  My biggest regret for not having an iPad Pro right now,
[38:14.440 --> 38:18.760]  myself, is the new app from the icon factory, Linnea,
[38:18.760 --> 38:22.400]  which is a very cool drawing app.
[38:22.400 --> 38:24.880]  And it works just fine, as best as it possibly
[38:24.880 --> 38:29.880]  could on a non-pro iPad using these big fingertip-shaped
[38:29.880 --> 38:32.800]  styluses like I have.
[38:32.800 --> 38:35.200]  But clearly it is meant for the pencil,
[38:35.200 --> 38:37.320]  because it's a very, very nice drawing app.
[38:37.320 --> 38:40.320]  And I don't really, it's not like I'm an illustrator,
[38:40.320 --> 38:42.240]  but it's my favorite drawing app that I've
[38:42.240 --> 38:45.280]  seen to date for the iPad.
[38:45.280 --> 38:47.160]  And so just as a user interface nerd,
[38:47.160 --> 38:51.320]  I like playing with it to see what they've done.
[38:51.320 --> 38:55.360]  But it's clearly I'm only getting half the experience
[38:55.360 --> 38:57.760]  by not having an Apple Pencil right now.
[39:01.680 --> 39:04.520]  There's a thing that I saw where Apple told me about it, really,
[39:04.520 --> 39:06.480]  that I don't have a link to it.
[39:06.480 --> 39:09.360]  But there's a Logitech case that Apple
[39:09.360 --> 39:14.960]  is promoting, especially in education, with this new iPad.
[39:14.960 --> 39:17.320]  And it's sort of, you can see why
[39:17.320 --> 39:18.680]  Apple wouldn't make it itself.
[39:18.680 --> 39:19.880]  It's thick.
[39:19.880 --> 39:24.520]  And so it's, in terms of like, it's
[39:24.520 --> 39:26.480]  both a case around the iPad itself.
[39:26.480 --> 39:29.040]  And it's more like one of those like gorilla cases,
[39:29.040 --> 39:32.440]  or whatever they call them, where it's like a rugged.
[39:32.440 --> 39:34.400]  And it's really quite thick.
[39:34.400 --> 39:38.040]  But it also, it plugs into the lightning port.
[39:38.040 --> 39:40.440]  So it just wraps around sort of like a battery case.
[39:40.440 --> 39:41.720]  Maybe it might even be a battery.
[39:41.720 --> 39:42.320]  I don't even know.
[39:42.320 --> 39:42.820]  It might.
[39:42.820 --> 39:45.280]  But it definitely plugs into the lightning port.
[39:45.280 --> 39:47.080]  And then it has a keyboard.
[39:47.080 --> 39:47.920]  There's two versions.
[39:47.920 --> 39:50.000]  There's one that's just a rugged case.
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  And then there's one with a physical keyboard.
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.920]  So you can prop it up like a laptop.
[39:54.920 --> 39:57.200]  And the reason why it plugs in the lightning port
[39:57.200 --> 40:04.200]  is that for standardized tests in K through 12,
[40:04.200 --> 40:06.080]  the ones that are computerized have
[40:06.080 --> 40:09.680]  to be done with a keyboard that has a physical connection
[40:09.680 --> 40:10.680]  to the computing device.
[40:10.680 --> 40:13.080]  You're not allowed to take it.
[40:13.080 --> 40:15.480]  The standardized tests do not allow the use of Bluetooth
[40:15.480 --> 40:18.920]  keyboards or mice.
[40:18.920 --> 40:24.320]  I presumably for like cheating type thing,
[40:24.320 --> 40:26.400]  like you're not allowed, I guess the idea
[40:26.400 --> 40:30.960]  is that when the device is in testing mode,
[40:30.960 --> 40:37.000]  it is not allowed to have any wireless IO, which I guess
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.240]  makes some amount of sense.
[40:39.240 --> 40:42.320]  Just, you know, I'm not quite sure how they enforce it
[40:42.320 --> 40:42.940]  in software.
[40:42.940 --> 40:44.240]  But that's the idea.
[40:44.240 --> 40:45.120]  I mean, it's not dumb.
[40:45.120 --> 40:47.520]  We used to beam Palm Pilot answers
[40:47.520 --> 40:48.800]  to each other in high school.
[40:48.800 --> 40:51.360]  So you were ahead of the curve.
[40:51.360 --> 40:52.120]  Not a dumb idea.
[40:52.120 --> 40:53.520]  I definitely was ahead of the curve.
[40:53.520 --> 40:55.440]  The teacher had no idea what that thing was.
[40:55.440 --> 40:57.840]  But it's interesting.
[41:01.560 --> 41:03.680]  And I asked, so the smart connector
[41:03.680 --> 41:05.960]  counts as a wired connection.
[41:05.960 --> 41:07.720]  So if you wanted to, you could use
[41:07.720 --> 41:10.600]  an iPad Pro and the smart keyboard
[41:10.600 --> 41:11.760]  through the smart connector.
[41:11.760 --> 41:12.520]  That would count.
[41:12.520 --> 41:15.360]  That's not wireless because it is electricity flowing
[41:15.360 --> 41:17.880]  through a connector.
[41:17.880 --> 41:21.960]  But it's the iPad Pros and the expensive keyboard
[41:21.960 --> 41:23.840]  and everything is way outside the budget
[41:23.840 --> 41:25.760]  for elementary schools.
[41:25.760 --> 41:27.240]  But I thought that was interesting
[41:27.240 --> 41:30.760]  that they can't use Bluetooth.
[41:30.760 --> 41:32.960]  So I guess I'm a little surprised that the cheaper iPad,
[41:32.960 --> 41:35.200]  this new one, doesn't have the smart connector.
[41:35.200 --> 41:37.060]  I can see why it doesn't have the pencil.
[41:37.060 --> 41:38.480]  I'm a little surprised it doesn't
[41:38.480 --> 41:39.240]  have the smart connector.
[41:39.240 --> 41:41.440]  But maybe the smart connector adds enough to the cost
[41:41.440 --> 41:44.520]  that it really, you know, that to get all the way down to 329,
[41:44.520 --> 41:47.880]  you really do have to make hard decisions like that.
[41:47.880 --> 41:48.800]  Yeah, it's interesting.
[41:48.800 --> 41:51.720]  And obviously, the screen not having
[41:51.720 --> 41:55.040]  anti-reflective coating on it.
[41:55.040 --> 41:58.680]  Yeah, and it doesn't have the lamination of the display
[41:58.680 --> 41:59.760]  to the glass.
[41:59.760 --> 42:05.800]  So there's that very narrow air gap between the, you know,
[42:05.800 --> 42:08.560]  it just looks like the pixels are slightly lower.
[42:08.560 --> 42:11.520]  They are, in fact, slightly further away from the surface
[42:11.520 --> 42:16.000]  of the glass than they are on the iPad Air 2, the iPad
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.320]  Pro, and all the iPhones from recent years.
[42:19.320 --> 42:21.480]  But on a device that big, I saw one last week.
[42:21.480 --> 42:24.220]  It doesn't, it's not very noticeable.
[42:24.220 --> 42:26.880]  I don't know if I, you know, I guess I could do it side by side
[42:26.880 --> 42:30.880]  but it just, if you just gave me one iPad and asked me to guess,
[42:30.880 --> 42:32.160]  I'm not sure if I could see it.
[42:35.280 --> 42:36.720]  It's new too.
[42:36.720 --> 42:41.760]  Mine has some, I think, some permanent fingerprints on it
[42:41.760 --> 42:47.120]  at this point, even with the anti-reflective, so.
[42:47.120 --> 42:53.200]  I've told this story before, but it's one of my favorites.
[42:53.200 --> 42:57.800]  So one of the two times that I met Steve Jobs personally
[42:57.800 --> 43:02.320]  was after the keynote when they announced the iPhone 4, which
[43:02.320 --> 43:06.040]  was the first retina iPhone and the first one
[43:06.040 --> 43:09.360]  where the screen was fused to the glass.
[43:09.360 --> 43:11.320]  And it's the hands-on area.
[43:11.320 --> 43:14.680]  It was on the side hallway beside the big keynote area
[43:14.680 --> 43:16.200]  in Moscone.
[43:16.200 --> 43:18.440]  And I was just hanging around.
[43:18.440 --> 43:20.440]  And I got to talk to Scott Forstall.
[43:20.440 --> 43:22.720]  And he, you know, I'd never talked to him before.
[43:22.720 --> 43:24.640]  And he obviously knew who I was.
[43:24.640 --> 43:27.000]  And he said he reads during Fireball, likes it a lot.
[43:27.000 --> 43:27.840]  And it was very complimentary.
[43:27.840 --> 43:29.240]  We had a great little discussion.
[43:29.240 --> 43:33.240]  And Katie Cotton was talking to me then.
[43:33.240 --> 43:35.360]  And then she said, would you like to meet Steve?
[43:35.360 --> 43:39.240]  And I just said, has anybody ever said no to that?
[43:39.240 --> 43:40.800]  And she laughed and said, no.
[43:40.800 --> 43:42.400]  Actually, nobody has ever said no to that.
[43:42.400 --> 43:43.080]  And I said, sure.
[43:43.080 --> 43:44.680]  So she walked me over and introduced me.
[43:44.680 --> 43:50.440]  And I was talking with Steve Jobs and Forstall.
[43:50.440 --> 43:52.280]  And he asked what I thought of the phone.
[43:52.280 --> 43:53.440]  I said it was beautiful.
[43:53.440 --> 43:58.400]  I've been waiting for retina, retina, retina, retina,
[43:58.400 --> 44:03.040]  retina, screens forever, you know, high resolution screens.
[44:03.040 --> 44:04.880]  We talked about other, I don't know, probably
[44:04.880 --> 44:07.440]  about five minutes, but it felt like it just rushed right by.
[44:07.440 --> 44:09.400]  But I said, like, about the lamination.
[44:09.400 --> 44:10.800]  And I had a question about that.
[44:10.800 --> 44:12.240]  And he had all the details.
[44:12.240 --> 44:13.920]  He knew exactly how it worked.
[44:13.920 --> 44:19.360]  In fact, he said they had to invent the machines to do it.
[44:19.360 --> 44:21.880]  There was no factory in China could do it.
[44:21.880 --> 44:23.360]  So they invented their own machines
[44:23.360 --> 44:26.440]  and filled the factory in Foxconn
[44:26.440 --> 44:29.200]  with these Apple-invented machines to do it.
[44:29.200 --> 44:32.160]  And I said, so there's literally no air gap anymore.
[44:32.160 --> 44:34.600]  It's impossible for a piece of dust
[44:34.600 --> 44:36.860]  to get between the screen and the glass.
[44:36.860 --> 44:39.760]  And he said, nope, it's absolutely impossible.
[44:39.760 --> 44:42.040]  And so I took out my personal 3GS.
[44:42.040 --> 44:44.180]  And I said, so I can't get like this.
[44:44.180 --> 44:47.680]  And I showed him the piece of dust
[44:47.680 --> 44:50.880]  that was sort of like right in the center of the screen
[44:50.880 --> 44:55.480]  horizontally and about two inches up from the bottom.
[44:55.480 --> 44:56.720]  And he laughed.
[44:56.720 --> 44:59.520]  And he said, no, that can't happen again.
[44:59.520 --> 45:03.920]  But I love that I got to show Steve Jobs the pieces of dust
[45:03.920 --> 45:06.200]  in my iPhone.
[45:06.200 --> 45:08.160]  Nice.
[45:08.160 --> 45:10.960]  A good use of a rare opportunity.
[45:13.720 --> 45:15.440]  What else did they have?
[45:15.440 --> 45:17.960]  Was there any more hardware?
[45:17.960 --> 45:21.160]  Well, they had the app, which was interesting.
[45:21.160 --> 45:25.600]  And to me, the app is a sign that there's not an event
[45:25.600 --> 45:27.800]  coming before WWDC, because that's
[45:27.800 --> 45:30.560]  the kind of thing that seemed like it would have been useful
[45:30.560 --> 45:31.760]  for a live demo.
[45:31.760 --> 45:33.560]  Demoable, totally demoable.
[45:33.560 --> 45:37.240]  And in fact, in the briefing that I had, by far and away,
[45:37.240 --> 45:40.880]  the overall majority of the time was talking about clips
[45:40.880 --> 45:44.400]  and demoing clips and going through a sort of here's
[45:44.400 --> 45:46.680]  how you use it type thing.
[45:46.680 --> 45:48.840]  Which is it out now, because it's 2.3?
[45:48.840 --> 45:52.960]  It is coming out in, quote unquote, April.
[45:52.960 --> 45:53.640]  It was funny.
[45:53.640 --> 45:56.640]  So they said it requires 10.3.
[45:56.640 --> 46:02.480]  And I asked if that meant is it going to come out the same day
[46:02.480 --> 46:03.420]  10.3 comes out?
[46:03.420 --> 46:06.280]  Because they didn't have an announcement date for 10.3.
[46:06.280 --> 46:14.080]  And it was so typical Apple where the answer was it's
[46:14.080 --> 46:14.640]  coming out.
[46:14.640 --> 46:16.300]  They said to me, it's coming out in April
[46:16.300 --> 46:18.120]  and requires iOS 10.3.
[46:18.120 --> 46:20.000]  And I said, does that mean it's going to come out the same day
[46:20.000 --> 46:21.120]  10.3 comes out?
[46:21.120 --> 46:23.000]  And their answer was, it's coming out in April
[46:23.000 --> 46:26.080]  and it requires iOS 10.3.
[46:26.080 --> 46:28.040]  Amazing.
[46:28.040 --> 46:30.000]  You've had those answers too, right?
[46:30.000 --> 46:30.920]  Of course.
[46:30.920 --> 46:33.920]  And when they repeat the answer once, and they do it.
[46:33.920 --> 46:35.880]  They don't do it like you're a moron.
[46:35.880 --> 46:39.800]  They don't do it as though they haven't told you that before.
[46:39.800 --> 46:45.400]  They do it with a please take a hint that this is all.
[46:45.400 --> 46:48.240]  I can't give you a yes or no.
[46:48.240 --> 46:51.400]  So I took it to mean that maybe it was going to,
[46:51.400 --> 46:53.440]  and then maybe that's what they were shooting for.
[46:53.440 --> 46:55.880]  But I think what happened, they did
[46:55.880 --> 46:58.120]  know it wasn't coming out till April already.
[46:58.120 --> 47:01.800]  And I think I was there last Wednesday or I forget what day,
[47:01.800 --> 47:05.040]  but it was last week.
[47:05.040 --> 47:08.600]  They did know that Eclipse wasn't coming out till April.
[47:08.600 --> 47:11.440]  And I think that maybe what happened is that 10.3 was ready
[47:11.440 --> 47:13.520]  first, and they didn't want to hold it back.
[47:13.520 --> 47:15.520]  I don't think they like holding back
[47:15.520 --> 47:17.720]  iOS updates because of the security stuff in them.
[47:17.720 --> 47:21.360]  That when they get the go ahead from their testing people
[47:21.360 --> 47:26.440]  that, hey, this is ready to ship, they ship it.
[47:26.440 --> 47:28.400]  But anyway, I think it's a great app.
[47:28.400 --> 47:31.520]  I know that at first, it seemed like some
[47:31.520 --> 47:34.880]  of the initial reaction on Twitter was sort of, oh,
[47:34.880 --> 47:43.640]  Apple is piling on this Me Too Snapchat slash Instagram slash
[47:43.640 --> 47:46.440]  every single product Facebook owns stories sort
[47:46.440 --> 47:52.000]  of multimedia posting things.
[47:52.000 --> 47:54.840]  And there's some part of that that's obviously there
[47:54.840 --> 47:58.400]  because Apple is emphasizing that you can share these.
[47:58.400 --> 48:00.560]  They're just videos, and you can share them
[48:00.560 --> 48:02.040]  to any service you want.
[48:02.040 --> 48:04.840]  But they're not making their own social network to do it.
[48:04.840 --> 48:06.440]  It has nothing to do with the networking.
[48:06.440 --> 48:09.720]  It has just to do with the creation of this new sort
[48:09.720 --> 48:12.280]  of hybrid media format.
[48:12.280 --> 48:13.520]  And I find it fascinating.
[48:13.520 --> 48:16.120]  And in the time I got to play with it,
[48:16.120 --> 48:17.720]  I was super impressed with the app.
[48:17.720 --> 48:24.760]  It is, to me, it is the software equivalent of AirPods,
[48:24.760 --> 48:27.640]  where hardware-wise, AirPods are my favorite new Apple
[48:27.640 --> 48:29.840]  product in a long time.
[48:29.840 --> 48:34.120]  And to me, is Apple at its best?
[48:34.120 --> 48:36.040]  I think clips is the same thing with software.
[48:36.040 --> 48:37.920]  Sure, it's just a little thing.
[48:37.920 --> 48:43.040]  It's not like a major, super major new thing in the same way
[48:43.040 --> 48:44.960]  that, hey, they're just headphones, right?
[48:44.960 --> 48:45.480]  It's sure.
[48:45.480 --> 48:49.920]  It's just a little way to make little animated movies.
[48:49.920 --> 48:51.400]  But it's so well done.
[48:51.400 --> 48:52.760]  Like, I described it on Twitter.
[48:52.760 --> 48:54.400]  I worked on this tweet for a while.
[48:54.400 --> 48:56.680]  But I described it as, it's as though Keynote
[48:56.680 --> 48:59.720]  and iMovie had a baby, and the kid got all the best genes
[48:59.720 --> 49:00.560]  from both parents.
[49:00.560 --> 49:01.560]  Ha, ha.
[49:04.560 --> 49:07.280]  And if you want to look at it deeper and more strategically,
[49:07.280 --> 49:11.160]  it's also one of the first, if not the first,
[49:11.160 --> 49:15.240]  augmented reality software tools from Apple, in a sense.
[49:15.240 --> 49:15.760]  Yeah.
[49:15.760 --> 49:17.000]  Yeah.
[49:17.000 --> 49:20.320]  If you believe that they are building AR glasses
[49:20.320 --> 49:23.560]  and that the new iPhone might have some AR features
[49:23.560 --> 49:26.640]  in it, it seems pretty obvious to start
[49:26.640 --> 49:28.600]  shipping that kind of stuff.
[49:28.600 --> 49:31.160]  Well, I guess it kind of is an AR feature.
[49:31.160 --> 49:32.040]  I don't know.
[49:32.040 --> 49:39.800]  It does, it definitely, is it AR?
[49:39.800 --> 49:40.960]  I don't know if it qualifies.
[49:40.960 --> 49:42.520]  But like, for example, if I would.
[49:42.520 --> 49:44.800]  AR is kind of a murky thing to define.
[49:44.800 --> 49:45.320]  Right.
[49:45.320 --> 49:47.760]  It's like, in some senses, Pokemon Go was AR.
[49:47.760 --> 49:49.080]  But in others, it's not really.
[49:49.080 --> 49:51.000]  It's just a game.
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.440]  Right, in some sense, I almost feel, yeah,
[49:54.440 --> 49:57.080]  like let's not worry about what is and is not
[49:57.080 --> 50:01.600]  augmented reality in a capital A, capital R sense.
[50:01.600 --> 50:04.760]  But instead, just think about the ways
[50:04.760 --> 50:09.200]  that these devices with, especially the camera,
[50:09.200 --> 50:11.040]  but other, and the microphone.
[50:11.040 --> 50:13.520]  The camera and microphone are obviously the two main inputs.
[50:13.520 --> 50:17.400]  But other sensors as well are aware of where they are
[50:17.400 --> 50:18.600]  and how they're being used.
[50:18.600 --> 50:22.280]  And so the example with clips is, if I'm shooting you
[50:22.280 --> 50:23.680]  and I'm putting you in a clip, it
[50:23.680 --> 50:26.480]  does real-time facial recognition
[50:26.480 --> 50:30.480]  and knows that Dan Fromer is in the clip.
[50:30.480 --> 50:32.680]  And so it's already there.
[50:32.680 --> 50:35.880]  And I forget exactly how that comes into play.
[50:35.880 --> 50:37.720]  I know one way that it comes into play
[50:37.720 --> 50:41.200]  is when I'm done making the clip and I go to share it,
[50:41.200 --> 50:42.800]  if it knows that you were in the clip,
[50:42.800 --> 50:45.280]  it'll suggest sending it to you.
[50:45.280 --> 50:45.800]  That's great.
[50:45.800 --> 50:48.680]  It'll suggest sending it to you.
[50:48.680 --> 50:50.760]  Oh, that's cool.
[50:50.760 --> 50:52.320]  There might be other things too, though,
[50:52.320 --> 50:55.640]  that you can do within the clip to somehow get you labeled
[50:55.640 --> 50:58.280]  or something like that.
[50:58.280 --> 51:01.880]  You know, my number one feature request from the internet
[51:01.880 --> 51:06.200]  is still the feed of photos that I'm in the background of,
[51:06.200 --> 51:08.920]  taken by all random people.
[51:08.920 --> 51:12.640]  Somewhere that exists that just hasn't been turned on yet.
[51:12.640 --> 51:14.840]  It's called the NSA.
[51:14.840 --> 51:17.080]  OK, yeah, true.
[51:17.080 --> 51:17.880]  Yes.
[51:17.880 --> 51:20.400]  But somebody is going to make a public version of that
[51:20.400 --> 51:21.880]  and it will be weird.
[51:21.880 --> 51:28.160]  But I remember reading a story, it's sort of a tangent,
[51:28.160 --> 51:31.120]  but I remember reading a story in Wired magazine,
[51:31.120 --> 51:33.160]  I'm going to say 10 years ago, but I don't even
[51:33.160 --> 51:35.120]  know if I was still reading Wired 10 years ago.
[51:35.120 --> 51:38.200]  So it might have been 15 or 20 years ago.
[51:38.200 --> 51:44.440]  But somebody was writing about as municipalities
[51:44.440 --> 51:48.800]  and cities put cameras at intersections and stuff
[51:48.800 --> 51:52.040]  like that, and that there's video monitoring
[51:52.040 --> 51:56.640]  of public spaces, that it's right for everybody
[51:56.640 --> 52:00.720]  to be concerned about privacy and access to the footage,
[52:00.720 --> 52:02.280]  but the way to deal with it isn't
[52:02.280 --> 52:06.800]  to lock it down super tight and only allow the police to see
[52:06.800 --> 52:09.720]  it, and the way to do it is to make them public.
[52:09.720 --> 52:15.400]  So that if there's a traffic camera at 15th and Locust
[52:15.400 --> 52:17.400]  and the police can get the footage of it,
[52:17.400 --> 52:19.400]  everybody should be able to get the footage of it
[52:19.400 --> 52:20.240]  over the internet.
[52:20.240 --> 52:21.640]  Because if I was standing there, I
[52:21.640 --> 52:23.320]  could see what's going on at the corner.
[52:23.320 --> 52:26.360]  So if there's a camera there and it's a publicly owned camera,
[52:26.360 --> 52:30.040]  why can't I get the footage of the camera?
[52:30.040 --> 52:32.200]  And there's some sense to that to me,
[52:32.200 --> 52:34.520]  but I'm not saying I completely agree with it,
[52:34.520 --> 52:35.880]  but I can see the logic behind it
[52:35.880 --> 52:37.560]  and I can sort of see the logic of, look,
[52:37.560 --> 52:40.840]  if some entities are collecting background information
[52:40.840 --> 52:42.680]  about who's in all these pictures that
[52:42.680 --> 52:44.960]  are being posted to Twitter, maybe everybody
[52:44.960 --> 52:47.920]  should have that information.
[52:47.920 --> 52:49.080]  Because the picture's on.
[52:49.080 --> 52:51.480]  If it's a public picture, if the picture's
[52:51.480 --> 52:56.800]  been posted to Twitter, it's there, why not notify me of it?
[52:56.800 --> 52:58.840]  I'm not sure about that.
[52:58.840 --> 53:01.520]  Anyway, I think Clips is pretty exciting.
[53:01.520 --> 53:02.840]  Yeah, I'm pumped for that one.
[53:02.840 --> 53:03.720]  That should be cool.
[53:03.720 --> 53:06.000]  But that's the kind of thing where
[53:06.000 --> 53:09.760]  I guess that if there was going to be a time
[53:09.760 --> 53:14.120]  to show that publicly and give a 10, 15 minute demo of it,
[53:14.120 --> 53:15.920]  it would be more desirable.
[53:15.920 --> 53:17.120]  Yeah, it would be on stage.
[53:17.120 --> 53:21.400]  And that would be more desirable than however many places
[53:21.400 --> 53:24.720]  were pre-briefed and got to demo it.
[53:24.720 --> 53:25.720]  Yeah, because it's hard.
[53:25.720 --> 53:31.640]  Because even if they have exciting new, like, all right,
[53:31.640 --> 53:33.480]  it's just a red iPhone 7, really.
[53:33.480 --> 53:35.480]  I mean, the red is nice.
[53:35.480 --> 53:38.080]  But it's not really demo-able on stage.
[53:38.080 --> 53:39.560]  Ultimately, it's the type of thing
[53:39.560 --> 53:40.720]  you really need to see in person.
[53:40.720 --> 53:42.360]  Everybody needs to go to a store and see
[53:42.360 --> 53:43.920]  it to really appreciate it.
[53:43.920 --> 53:45.920]  Because you know it's going to look good in a product
[53:45.920 --> 53:46.800]  photography.
[53:46.800 --> 53:49.120]  So the real question for anybody who's actually
[53:49.120 --> 53:50.120]  thinking about buying one is, what
[53:50.120 --> 53:51.280]  does it look like in person?
[53:51.280 --> 53:53.880]  So showing it on stage doesn't really help.
[53:53.880 --> 53:56.040]  iPhone SE has more storage.
[53:56.040 --> 53:57.800]  You can't demo that.
[53:57.800 --> 53:59.760]  That is, at best, one slide.
[53:59.760 --> 54:02.840]  And what, seven seconds is stage time.
[54:02.840 --> 54:04.480]  Software like Clips is what you need
[54:04.480 --> 54:08.200]  to actually fill a presentation.
[54:08.200 --> 54:13.560]  Which also says that there's too much at WWDC to save that for.
[54:13.560 --> 54:14.080]  Maybe.
[54:14.080 --> 54:14.520]  I don't know.
[54:14.520 --> 54:17.080]  Or maybe it's one of those things where it's ready to go
[54:17.080 --> 54:19.560]  and they want to get it out.
[54:19.560 --> 54:21.680]  One of the things that worked well for me, at least in my
[54:21.680 --> 54:26.800]  brief demo time, in, admittedly, an enclosed environment,
[54:26.800 --> 54:30.680]  so it wasn't lots of public noise or anything like that.
[54:30.680 --> 54:33.960]  But the way that you, when you speak, you can set,
[54:33.960 --> 54:36.760]  it doesn't do it all the time, but you can turn on a title
[54:36.760 --> 54:37.320]  style.
[54:37.320 --> 54:40.360]  And while the title style is on, it will,
[54:40.360 --> 54:41.720]  you speak to the camera.
[54:41.720 --> 54:45.920]  What you're saying turns into these animated titles.
[54:45.920 --> 54:47.200]  Oh, cool.
[54:47.200 --> 54:48.840]  It works very well.
[54:48.840 --> 54:53.640]  And it does it in a, depending on the style, I think,
[54:53.640 --> 54:55.160]  but at least in certain of the styles,
[54:55.160 --> 54:57.480]  the words only appear as you speak them.
[55:00.800 --> 55:03.160]  And one of the things that they're super cognizant of,
[55:03.160 --> 55:11.240]  and it's clearly designed for, is that these videos,
[55:11.240 --> 55:13.760]  they have sound, and they even have all these cool music
[55:13.760 --> 55:15.120]  soundtracks you can do with them,
[55:15.120 --> 55:17.560]  but that the assumption is that in many contexts,
[55:17.560 --> 55:19.480]  they're going to be played with the sound off,
[55:19.480 --> 55:21.960]  because people are at work or they're in public,
[55:21.960 --> 55:27.320]  and nobody likes a video that auto plays with sound.
[55:27.320 --> 55:29.560]  And so that's why they, I think, they put so much emphasis
[55:29.560 --> 55:31.240]  on these titles.
[55:31.240 --> 55:34.880]  But it's really pretty cool the way that the titles sync up
[55:34.880 --> 55:37.920]  with the words you're saying as you're saying them.
[55:37.920 --> 55:40.200]  And it seems like the sort of thing
[55:40.200 --> 55:45.160]  that would take a lot of fiddling with in the software
[55:45.160 --> 55:46.200]  to do, but you don't.
[55:46.200 --> 55:48.760]  You just turn on the title, and as you're holding the button,
[55:48.760 --> 55:51.840]  it happens automatically.
[55:51.840 --> 55:53.920]  You get, the result is you get an effect
[55:53.920 --> 55:56.320]  that looks like it took a lot of precision editing,
[55:56.320 --> 55:58.240]  and instead you got it automatically.
[55:58.240 --> 56:00.720]  Yeah.
[56:00.720 --> 56:01.560]  That's cool.
[56:01.560 --> 56:05.560]  That sounds as close to magic as we can get these days almost.
[56:05.560 --> 56:06.320]  Yeah.
[56:06.320 --> 56:08.920]  I think maybe the single most appley thing about it
[56:08.920 --> 56:13.720]  is that among the soundtracks that they've commissioned,
[56:13.720 --> 56:16.120]  number one, they've commissioned a whole bunch of these soundtracks
[56:16.120 --> 56:17.400]  of different styles.
[56:17.400 --> 56:20.040]  But they've had the artists who make them
[56:20.040 --> 56:23.040]  make them in a whole bunch of different lengths.
[56:23.040 --> 56:27.520]  So the same song, if you make just a little four second
[56:27.520 --> 56:33.040]  clip, there's a version of it that maybe isn't recorded
[56:33.040 --> 56:34.200]  as exactly four seconds.
[56:34.200 --> 56:35.960]  But there's a version for, hey, what
[56:35.960 --> 56:38.160]  if the clip is only like three to five seconds long?
[56:38.160 --> 56:40.320]  We'll use this one, and there's a beginning
[56:40.320 --> 56:42.080]  and an end that makes sense.
[56:42.080 --> 56:44.680]  But if you have a 30 second clip, it's the same song,
[56:44.680 --> 56:46.840]  but it's a different version that
[56:46.840 --> 56:50.480]  is meant to be roughly 30 seconds long.
[56:50.480 --> 56:51.880]  But the part that's super appley is
[56:51.880 --> 56:56.520]  that they have ones that were created by Hans Zimmer.
[56:56.520 --> 57:00.800]  They actually paid Hans Zimmer to do some of these.
[57:00.800 --> 57:03.720]  Like every other tech company in the world, I think,
[57:03.720 --> 57:08.960]  might have hired somebody like Zahn Himmer.
[57:08.960 --> 57:11.400]  Make us something that sounds like a Hans Zimmer song.
[57:11.400 --> 57:13.760]  And instead, Apple went and paid Hans Zimmer to do it.
[57:13.760 --> 57:15.960]  That's pretty cool.
[57:15.960 --> 57:19.240]  Did you get a sense it's mostly for tall screen
[57:19.240 --> 57:20.640]  video, for mobile video?
[57:20.640 --> 57:24.720]  Or is it also for uploading YouTube and stuff?
[57:24.720 --> 57:29.200]  It is, in fact, the app only works when
[57:29.200 --> 57:31.600]  you're holding it tall screen.
[57:31.600 --> 57:34.160]  The app does not rotate.
[57:34.160 --> 57:37.600]  But the format is like old school Instagram.
[57:37.600 --> 57:40.560]  It is only and always square.
[57:40.560 --> 57:41.840]  Oh, wow.
[57:41.840 --> 57:48.640]  And it is intended for consumption on mobile first.
[57:48.640 --> 57:50.920]  And I asked about that.
[57:50.920 --> 57:52.560]  This is great that you asked, because it
[57:52.560 --> 57:54.520]  was one of my big questions.
[57:54.520 --> 57:58.560]  If you import, so anything you shoot while you're in clips
[57:58.560 --> 58:01.000]  is always automatically square.
[58:01.000 --> 58:07.560]  If you import from your library a photo or a video
[58:07.560 --> 58:12.560]  that you shot in a rectangular format, it crops to a square.
[58:12.560 --> 58:16.440]  But you get to pan and scan within it to where you want it.
[58:16.440 --> 58:18.480]  And if it's a video, it's not just
[58:18.480 --> 58:20.400]  like you pick the square and the whole thing.
[58:20.400 --> 58:22.480]  You can change it as the video plays,
[58:22.480 --> 58:26.560]  like which portion of it appears in the square.
[58:26.560 --> 58:30.080]  That's what I mean about it being a very keynote slash
[58:30.080 --> 58:32.160]  iMovie-esque caliber app.
[58:32.160 --> 58:34.560]  Like every little thing like that
[58:34.560 --> 58:36.160]  that I could think of during the demo,
[58:36.160 --> 58:38.440]  they were like, yes, it already does that.
[58:38.440 --> 58:41.000]  I thought I had them pegged on a whole bunch of these things.
[58:41.000 --> 58:42.360]  I thought, oh, well, what happens
[58:42.360 --> 58:45.120]  if the beginning of the video, the center, is the best part,
[58:45.120 --> 58:48.520]  but at the end of the video, the best part's over on the right?
[58:48.520 --> 58:50.960]  It handles that.
[58:50.960 --> 58:53.280]  And so the idea is they said, this
[58:53.280 --> 58:55.560]  is one of the things they said about going with square,
[58:55.560 --> 58:59.720]  is that on mobile, square always looks good.
[58:59.720 --> 59:04.840]  And what they've noticed is that a lot of people,
[59:04.840 --> 59:06.560]  in their observations, even when they're
[59:06.560 --> 59:11.640]  watching 16 to 9 horizontal video on their phone,
[59:11.640 --> 59:14.480]  if it's a short clip, they don't even bother rotating the phone.
[59:14.480 --> 59:19.920]  They just watch it tiny and centered in their phone
[59:19.920 --> 59:22.800]  as it's held tall, because it's so much more
[59:22.800 --> 59:27.880]  comfortable to hold your phone tall than to hold it sideways.
[59:27.880 --> 59:31.000]  Yeah, I definitely do that.
[59:31.000 --> 59:33.880]  What sense do you get on why they made something like this?
[59:33.880 --> 59:37.160]  It seems kind of, you know, used to make stuff like this,
[59:37.160 --> 59:40.400]  like Photo Booth on the Mac, because there
[59:40.400 --> 59:42.920]  was a camera on the front of the MacBook,
[59:42.920 --> 59:44.560]  and you needed something to do with it.
[59:44.560 --> 59:48.360]  But it seems like they do this less often now.
[59:48.360 --> 59:49.200]  I do think so.
[59:49.200 --> 59:51.560]  And I think that's why it makes me so happy,
[59:51.560 --> 59:53.760]  because I do think that making creative tools is
[59:53.760 --> 59:55.000]  what Apple does best.
[59:55.000 --> 59:58.640]  And I think it's a sense.
[59:58.640 --> 01:00:01.280]  You know, they don't really, Apple
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.120]  doesn't generally like to explain
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:04.520]  the why behind a lot of things.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.280]  But I just think it's because they could,
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.280]  and they knew that they could do a good job.
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:09.600]  I think they saw an opportunity.
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.880]  And I think that what they saw, this I guess they kind of did
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:18.320]  say, was that they could kind of see that this hybrid format is
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.160]  becoming a new thing.
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:23.960]  You know, that it's like at a meta level above a video,
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:28.240]  or a still photo, or even just a still photo
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:31.880]  with like a static annotation over it.
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:34.160]  You know how like you can make in Mail now?
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.600]  Like if I paste an image in Mail,
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.960]  I can edit, click the little toolbox,
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:44.240]  and draw like an arrow, or circle something on the image.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:49.080]  That a sort of combination between a video
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:52.880]  and an annotated image is becoming a new format.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:57.040]  And that they could make a tool that does it better.
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:57.840]  And it really does.
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:59.880]  It does also all the things you think you could do.
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:07.720]  Like when you drag out a thought bubble or something like that.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.440]  You can pinch it to scale it.
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:13.040]  You can two finger twist it to rotate it.
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:15.960]  You can drag it anywhere you want on the canvas.
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.360]  Everything you think you should be
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.040]  able to do to the little things you drag out and put
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.680]  on the canvas, you can do.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:28.160]  And I think some of it is we know how to do this already.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:32.720]  Like the end result is a format that's sort of new.
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:36.800]  But the little things you can do,
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.200]  Apple already had some of the software to do it.
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:42.880]  It's interesting, though, with the square aspect ratio.
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:46.080]  Because then I don't know if you can
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:49.720]  make much use of this uploading to an Instagram Stories
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:52.600]  or Snapchat or something like that.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:56.720]  So it is not super useful for that, I guess.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.200]  Well, I wonder, though, maybe what
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.560]  people will do with them, though,
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:02.320]  is upgrade them as a regular Instagram post.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.560]  True.
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:01:45.400]  Which I'm doing less of now because of the
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.400]  stories.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.240]  So maybe that'll be useful.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.240]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.320]  I don't know if I've ever even posted one
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.900]  on a
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:59.780]  Academic
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:05.580]  Well, I wonder though maybe what people will do with them though is upgrade them to as a regular Instagram post true
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:08.340]  Which I'm doing less of now because of the
[01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:11.300]  Stories, so maybe that'll be
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:16.340]  Useful. Yeah, I don't know. I don't I don't know if I've ever even posted an Instagram story
[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:18.340]  I don't know what to make of it
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:21.260]  With Instagram stories, I love it
[01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:24.380]  I think it's great, but I can see why people don't do it, too
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:28.420]  But with Instagram stories correct me if I'm wrong. You can't pick from your library
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:30.420]  You've got to create a new thing right now on the fly
[01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:33.460]  No, you can use anything from the last 24 hours
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:38.500]  That was kind of something they did differently than snapchat snapchat won't let you
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:43.420]  Used to not let you pick from the library now you kind of can but it's not super great
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:49.500]  So if I make a clip and save it to my library, I could upgrade upload it as an Instagram story. Yes
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:54.380]  Yeah, I think people might do that. I really do because I think that it's a richer editing tool. It's it's
[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:59.740]  It's got it'll be it'll zoom in then because Instagram stories will take up the full
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:02.420]  16 by 9 vertical frame
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:07.660]  I wonder if it'll zoom in or fill just crop it or you know like letterbox it
[01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:13.220]  It will zoom in now. Well, at least that's what it does with still photos
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:18.960]  I have not actually tried it with a square video. Yeah, I think it will zoom in. Hmm
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:27.440]  Well, I don't know but some people who do like some more I've noticed some people I think using either iMovie or Final Cut to make
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:34.680]  Crazy, you know effects in their Instagram stories and then popping it in there obviously using tools
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:39.920]  You couldn't use in the native Instagram app, but most people obviously don't do that. Most people are using the
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:44.280]  Instagram tools. Well, I don't know again. I'm not a story user
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.040]  So maybe I'm the wrong person to judge it
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:51.160]  But I would think that if you take the time to use clips, which is a little bit more effort than just whipping it out
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.840]  You know just doing it live in the Instagram app
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:57.760]  If you're going to take the time to use clips, you probably want to post it as a regular post anyway
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.760]  Not have it disappear
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:04.280]  Yeah, that makes sense. I don't know. I am really excited about it
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:07.920]  And I just think it from what I saw it is really really well done
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:11.120]  it's it's not just that the features are well done, but even the
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.120]  The
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:20.320]  The user experience, I don't know what you call it, but the the the layout of the app is
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:26.200]  very very very thoughtfully done again a way in it the best sort of
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:33.240]  Structure to the entire user interface, which is that I think most people will never even think wow
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:38.640]  This has a really nice interface because it's just so obvious, you know, like it's when you do it, right it it
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:43.680]  It just disappears. All it is is just two layers. It's like at the root level
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:48.880]  There's just a horizontal stream of your clips that you've already made
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.320]  So you can select a clip that you're like halfway through
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:59.420]  Meet a clip meaning a project right so you can select one that you're already already made and it opens back up again
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:02.360]  And then that's that's the only two layers
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:07.560]  there's one for choosing and then you tap one or make add the plus button to create a new one and
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:11.280]  You're in the clips editor and within the clips editor
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.740]  There's only just a few things you can do and you it's there's no way to get lost
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:15.920]  You know
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:18.980]  I one of the I I feel like apps like Instagram like Instagram
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:23.520]  Has broken all the rules of what Instagram is by adding all these new features
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:30.940]  Right, like when you swipe from the left to go to the thing where you edit your stories or whatever the hell that is
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:35.360]  Like where are you in the app spatially? You're it's just something they made up
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:40.160]  There's no on-screen indication of where you are like as opposed to the old
[01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:44.240]  Instagram where you were always in one of the five tabs at the bottom of the screen
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:52.300]  Well, actually if you do it now there's a little slider that kind of suggests that you're going toward the camera
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.880]  There's a little
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:57.960]  Slider thing. But yeah, I I kind of get what you're going at
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:05.120]  They definitely borrowed a lot of this navigational concept from snapchat which was very confusing at first, but now well
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:10.420]  And the other one too is you can slide to the other side too and you in your direct messages
[01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:13.280]  And I know what you mean. I see what you mean that there's I'm looking at it right now
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.780]  Yes, I see the little indicator that it's over there
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:22.580]  But an Instagram to me is better than almost certainly better than snapchat. I mean snapchat. It feels like a fever dream to me
[01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:25.960]  I mean, I honest to God feel like I'm losing my mind when I a
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:31.160]  Just try to understand the app and be trying to try to understand how it's
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:33.880]  fabulously popular
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:37.540]  It really does make me feel like I'm losing my goddamn mind
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:45.000]  Whereas Instagram was always I mean right from the first day that it shipped I was like, oh I love the design of this app
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  I get it and and
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:53.740]  My design sensibilities are sympathetic with the people who designed this even now that they've added these things
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:56.240]  I still think that the people who design Instagram are
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.040]  of a like mind to me
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:03.560]  But I still feel like it's kind of confusing yeah, I
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:09.800]  Guess the other thing that I saw along these same lines is I did see some day one
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:12.840]  Criticism from people on Twitter of why is this a separate app?
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:14.920]  Why didn't they just make this part of the camera app?
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:20.740]  And I think that that's that what I'm talking about is exactly why I'm glad Apple did not do that
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:24.840]  I think the camera app already kind of has a lot of stuff going on and
[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:32.680]  This is very different than like the camera app is all about getting one shot either a still or a video clip and
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:37.360]  Clips is all about making editing multiple clips together into a thing
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:41.940]  Like I feel like separating it into its own second app is exactly
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:49.360]  The right thing for Apple to do and I think it's exactly why iOS is so much less cluttered than the Mac
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:56.160]  I mean that whole why don't you put it in the Apple in the same app is exactly how iTunes got from a simple music
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:00.720]  Right. I was gonna say these are the same people who are there was a time about iTunes bloat
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:07.100]  Maybe there was a time when iTunes was like the perfect example of an app that did one thing really well
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:14.820]  Okay, instead of having a giant folder full of mp3s just throw them all into iTunes
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:20.780]  It'll sort them all out and you've got a nice little music library. That's organized by artist by album
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:29.820]  And every other feature they added like the visualizers and stuff was at least related to music playback and
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:34.260]  So, you know, I always do whenever you think like why not add that to the camera app?
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:38.060]  Just think that's that's how camera app turns into iTunes in five years
[01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:46.540]  Plus if it extends to new sensors like, you know, I are facial stuff or whatever that you may not want in the main camera app
[01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:49.180]  either
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:53.660]  So anyway, I think clips is gonna be pretty popular, but it's not out yet. So I guess we should stop talking about it. All right
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:58.700]  Let me take a break and thank our next sponsor. It is our good friends at Casper
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:04.380]  Casper makes an obsessively engineered mattress at a shockingly fair price go to casper.com
[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:10.620]  Slash the talk show and use code the talk show for 50 bucks towards your mattress with one exception
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:12.620]  I will tell you about in a moment
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:17.580]  Casper created one perfect mattress. They have engineers mattress engineers. That's a real thing
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:22.460]  They make one type of mattress. It's a combination of memory foam and
[01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:25.260]  some other type of foam that's
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:28.940]  Just the right amount of bounce just the right you don't
[01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:34.380]  It's madness buying mattresses from other companies where they have seven different types of mattresses to choose from
[01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:40.620]  All you should have to do is choose the size of bed you have and then get a good mattress
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:42.940]  That's it. And that's the way Casper works
[01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:49.420]  You pick a size. There's only one style they ship it to you in a crazy small box
[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:52.700]  At least crazily small compared to the size mattress that it is
[01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:57.580]  In a crazy small box at least crazily small compared to the size mattress that it is
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:02.780]  You open it according to your instructions take it up to your bedroom first. Don't open it downstairs
[01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:07.580]  Take it to the bedroom open it up in there. It sucks all the air out of the room. So
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:12.460]  Be careful, you know, don't hold your breath while it while it unfolds and then
[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:17.260]  You've got a full-size mattress right there in your room. It's a great mattress
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:21.900]  I've talked to i've convinced family members to buy these things and everybody's like wow
[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:28.300]  That is an amazing mattress. I mean, it's it's this is probably like the one product that I hawk here on the talk show
[01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:30.380]  that i've actually uh
[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:37.100]  Gotten the most people that I know personally to buy it it really is it is such an easier way to buy a mattress
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:42.700]  And it is a great mattress. I don't everybody i've i've personally convinced to buy one loves it
[01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:47.580]  Even if you don't though what they have is a hundred night home trial
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:51.900]  So you have a hundred days after you get it and if you don't like it you call them up
[01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:55.340]  And they just come send somebody to pick it up at your house get it out of your house
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:57.740]  And they give you a full refund no questions asked
[01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:01.180]  Uh, that's how confident they are in the quality of the mattress
[01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:03.580]  uh, so
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:04.940]  Go to casper.com
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:10.140]  Slash the talk show and use that code the talk show for 50 bucks towards your next mattress
[01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:16.300]  The only downside to that code is it doesn't work on their dog mattresses because the dog mattress already costs so little
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:19.020]  But i'm telling you right now if you have a dog and you need a mattress for your dog
[01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:21.340]  Get the casper your dog will love it. I
[01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:26.620]  I keep talking about this but everybody who has dogs who listens to the show is like this is my dog loves this thing
[01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:28.620]  He won't get up from it
[01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:31.420]  So there you go. My thanks to casper
[01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:38.700]  Oh what else we have to talk about this week dan I got to get ralph for one of those uh dog beds you should although
[01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:44.140]  I just I just got him one one of these wacky ones that that they crawl into and it's like
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:46.460]  Almost a sleeping bag. He's not into it. He's
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:49.420]  Thinks it's ridiculous. So
[01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:53.580]  Uh, what else i'll check it out
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:58.540]  Well, we should talk about the samsung thing. I think it's kind of interesting. Yeah. Um, so I think it was yesterday
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:01.260]  I wrote a yeah yesterday the I didn't you know
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:08.140]  I I actually forgot that the event was yesterday which I was I was invited to it
[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:12.380]  I forgot to put it on my calendar. I would have totally gone and checked it out in person. So
[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:14.380]  checked it out in person so
[01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:20.700]  Uh, whoops, um, and also we probably lost a lot of traffic on recode because I didn't write up a preview for it
[01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:25.820]  Uh, but it looks like the it looks like it was pretty much solely focused on the new
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:34.460]  Galaxy s8. I think it's called which usually is the phone they show off in february at mobile world congress. It's samsung's big
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:36.140]  phone
[01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:41.260]  uh, especially important this year because their last big phone which was the
[01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:43.980]  The note seven was the one that was
[01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:51.260]  Catching on fire. So, you know, not not only was this an important, uh flagship phone for them, but also kind of a
[01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:57.900]  Uh back from the dead moment. Also, they have all kinds of weird corporate shit going on. That's not good
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:08.220]  The only anyway the only company that thinks that thinks samsung's had a good run in the last year is probably uber
[01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:10.220]  Yeah, those lucky sovs
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:17.020]  But yeah, samsung's had people going to jail or at least getting a re uh of criminally investigated for bribery scandals
[01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:20.220]  they the the the note s7 thing is
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:27.660]  Is i've seen it in several cases and everybody and this is the worst part if you're samsung is every single article about the s8
[01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:32.720]  Mentions that six months ago. They had to recall their last flagship phone because they were exploding
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:38.480]  They were exploding and so it's like it's so a lot riding on this. Yeah
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:44.080]  I have not seen it in person. Uh, but people who
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.480]  Study these things really like it. Um, you know, it's still
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:53.120]  For me, the biggest problem is that it's running android so I would never use it
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:57.280]  Yeah, and not just android but samsung's like corrupted version of android
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:02.080]  Do you know and now and now that gets to now that becomes even more problematic because here they have their own
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.720]  Their own version of google
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:09.600]  Assistant called bixby. Yeah, which is a strange name
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:14.560]  But uh, but people are saying the hardware looks nice and
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:21.840]  So I wrote a uh a post yesterday on recode basically pointing out, you know, here we are again where
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:28.160]  Apple is now behind the industrial design kind of trend with phones again. Um,
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:33.440]  You know last time I would say last time I was more important last time is when it took apple
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.800]  I think a year or two probably too long to
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:44.660]  See that people were really into big phones. Uh, that's more of a functional design thing than than cosmetic
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:47.920]  But now we're at a phase where you know
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:55.200]  Apple theoretically has a new phone coming out this fall. That's going to look more like these newer ones with no bezel and
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:56.960]  edge-to-edge
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:57.920]  screen
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:03.680]  But maybe not maybe you know, I don't know what if something happens and it doesn't happen and now here we are where
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.280]  They are
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:09.520]  Six months behind maybe a year and a half behind the trend. Yeah
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:11.440]  and
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.440]  Is that a is that a huge problem?
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:16.880]  probably not in the grand scheme of things, but if i'm
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:23.280]  I mean if i'm apple I want to be ahead. I don't want to be coming from behind all the time. So
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.820]  I don't think it's great whether it'll affect sales or not, which is ultimately
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:35.200]  I think what matters it probably I think it probably won't but I think at a personal level apple
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:37.920]  wants to unveil
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:40.960]  if I and I everybody all the rumors are going to be
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:46.240]  If I and I everybody all the rumors seem to suggest that this is the year when there's going to be a new iphone
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:49.920]  That looks instantly before you even turn the screen on looks like a new iphone
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:54.000]  Not just a new color, but it's you know a new form factor
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:58.720]  Um with some, you know, quote-unquote edge-to-edge display
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.600]  um
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:08.480]  And I think apple when they have a product like that to unveil in particular the most important product in the company
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:13.840]  And the most popular product in the company they want the biggest wow factor as possible
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:16.800]  during the keynote when they do the unveil
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.200]  and
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:24.080]  I can't help but think that you're right that this samsung galaxy s8 in particular
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:30.560]  I know there are other android phones that are creeping closer to an edge-to-edge design and have smaller chins and foreheads
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:35.440]  And use curved oleds to get the display closer to the sides
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.440]  Sides
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.760]  But this seems like the one that is
[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:44.880]  Closest in general principle to the vague descriptions. We've heard of what apple is doing
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:48.400]  I don't know this one will ship in volume. I mean, yeah
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:54.240]  I don't know if you saw the the tweet from andy rubin who you know for most people should know andy rubin
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:59.920]  But he created this the sidekick and then android and ran, you know, obviously
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:03.200]  Ran android for a long time now. He's working on a new
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:09.280]  Handset company supposedly. I think it's called essential or something like that and he tweeted a couple days ago this thing
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.800]  That was basically a you know, a fake spy shot of an edge-to-edge android
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:21.440]  phone and said you can't wait for everyone to get their hands on this and then yesterday eric schmidt tweeted it out and
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:24.800]  You know looks looks nice. I haven't seen it in person
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:28.960]  I don't know how well it works but looks damn good and and I think xiaomi had one too
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:36.080]  But the samsung ones the is the first one that's going to ship in volume, you know, especially approaching volume of an iphone. So
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:42.640]  I I think it's a bummer to be able to not be able to be the first to make
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:51.360]  You know a really truly impressive industrial design these days but who knows maybe apple has something that will even next to this
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.920]  You know look
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:59.760]  Like a next generation thing, you don't know but I can't entirely possible but I can't help
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:03.200]  I think that that's that they're getting beaten to the punch. Um
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:05.760]  in some way at least
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:08.640]  and I think it's I got I got a little pushback on that but I I
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:13.760]  Second day, I hold I hold pretty strong to it. I think that uh, no i'm not the best
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.480]  I think I think it you know
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:18.880]  I you know
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:24.240]  Who knows I think one of the areas, you know, like with the race to bigger iphones apple was obviously caught
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:25.920]  flat
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:27.920]  because they
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:33.760]  I think that they really didn't foresee that that bigger significantly bigger screens were going to be popular
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.440]  I really don't think I really do think they got caught by surprise by that
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:43.120]  Wasn't that kind of by accident too? It didn't didn't android phones have to be bigger because they couldn't get
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:50.400]  The what was it the battery or the lte or something? That's my that's my theory. My theory was that that android phones to keep up
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:53.920]  With the performance of iphones had to be bigger. Um
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:58.560]  But it turned out people liked him and I love it. I'm a seven plus guy
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:05.520]  No regrets, right? Um, but but I think apple clearly got caught flat on that because I think bigger
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:12.100]  Bigger android phones started getting popular around 2011 and apple didn't come out with one until 2014
[01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:15.940]  2014 and we even learned from the lawsuit
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:22.180]  I forget if the email came from schiller or just somebody in schiller's product marketing group, but there was you know
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:26.100]  An email that was entered into evidence from apple product marketing
[01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:32.100]  That you know the public wants what we don't have bigger phones
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:34.900]  um
[01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:36.900]  And you know the success of the iphone se
[01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:43.220]  You know which sold in greater quantity than apple expected. They even said that in during a quarterly report last year
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:47.860]  Like three months after the iphone se came out that they were having trouble keeping up with demand because it was more popular
[01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:52.020]  And that's not to say everybody likes big phones people like small phones too. They like, you know
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:59.060]  You know, it's a goldilocks type thing, you know small medium large people have different tastes. Um
[01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:06.040]  Um, but I think in this case, they're not caught flat they've clearly been working towards reducing the bezel size on their devices
[01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:15.220]  Every step of the way, you know, the ipads used to have the thick bezel around all four sides and years ago reduced the
[01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:17.860]  the bezel on the side
[01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:22.900]  The side bezels on this side of the iphone have gotten closer to the edge over the years
[01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:24.900]  um
[01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:29.700]  So I don't think it's they just I don't think they got caught flat. I just think they got beaten to the market
[01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:36.260]  and I think part of it is because the apple can't make like samsung has a bit of an advantage in terms of
[01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:37.940]  uh
[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:44.660]  Being aggressive with their designs because they don't bank on just one phone per year as being the new design
[01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:49.060]  they they you know come out with the note seven and notes in the fall and
[01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:52.740]  Come out with the galaxy s models in the spring
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:54.740]  Um, and then whatever 200 other
[01:20:55.380 --> 01:21:01.140]  Right and when they models in between and when they first came out with the edge, they even called it the edge the whatever
[01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:04.420]  Samsung galaxy edge, I think was might have been the full name of the device
[01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:10.900]  It wasn't the only one there was a a sibling to it with very similar specs that came out at the same time
[01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:14.500]  That didn't have the edge to edge and I guess sold for less money
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:21.060]  But that way they didn't have to come up with as many of the presumably more expensive harder to make
[01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:26.340]  Flexible displays to do the edge thing to account for all of their sales
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:30.340]  Whereas whatever apple's coming up with if it's supposed to be the flagship iphone
[01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:35.300]  They have to be able to make 70 million of them in the first quarter
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:40.500]  Which i'm not really into that edge thing. Anyway, I always found that to be
[01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:43.460]  obnoxious, but so I
[01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:46.660]  It'd be interesting to see how much curvature to the
[01:21:46.660 --> 01:21:51.780]  Display apple ends up going with if they do something similar to that. Yeah, and and what they use it for
[01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:56.500]  like are they going to use it for content or is it going to light up with other colors sort of
[01:21:57.140 --> 01:21:59.140]  just to show you like
[01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:05.380]  You know, like I could see them doing it where it goes black while you're using email and only the flat part
[01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:11.940]  Is lit up with your email, but when you go to your home screen, maybe your wallpaper goes edge to edge or something like that
[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:19.460]  And if you remember samsung actually started off trying to get people to use it almost as a second screen like to have more information
[01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:24.980]  On it, but I I would have guessed no developers actually ended up supporting that for anything worthwhile
[01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:30.740]  So yeah, they kind of gave up on that it seems yeah, and then you know filed under the we actually don't have
[01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:36.740]  Even just speculative rumors. We don't really have a lot of information about the apple's next iphone other than
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:39.620]  the the supply chain
[01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:44.820]  Stuff that they're they're asking for a lot of these flexible oled displays
[01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:50.900]  But what they're actually going to use it for nobody knows so who knows maybe they'll replace, you know
[01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:53.620]  The volume buttons with virtual volume buttons
[01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:59.860]  I kind of dread that I but on the other hand i'm i'm totally on team
[01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:06.500]  It took me a while to convince myself that i'm 100 on the team, but I am after after six months
[01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:11.860]  I'm on team virtual home button, you know, the button that doesn't actually move on the iphone 7
[01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:20.340]  So, I don't know with some kind of proper haptics I could see maybe switching to virtual volume buttons. I don't know
[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:22.980]  I like the virtual home button
[01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:28.020]  But I also like the fact that it is depressed a little there and that you have it a border to press on
[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:33.060]  So, I don't know. I don't know how that works on a bigger but the new samsung does have that virtual
[01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:37.540]  It's all virtual
[01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:42.580]  Buttons now on the at least on the lower side. There is a hardware button for the assistant, which is weird
[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:46.420]  Yeah, but here's an idea that occurred to me is you know how you can
[01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:49.780]  You can click the volume buttons to snap a photo on the iphone
[01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:57.060]  And that used to be like a hack like there were third-party camera apps in the app store that did it before apple's built-in camera
[01:23:57.140 --> 01:23:58.260]  app did
[01:23:58.260 --> 01:24:00.260]  um
[01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:04.500]  And then apple like kicked them out because it wasn't allowed you're only supposed to use volume buttons for volume
[01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:08.980]  And then they like well, maybe that's a good idea and they added it to the actual system camera
[01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:14.980]  Um, oh I use it all the time. Okay, but they're not in a great location for snapping pictures
[01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:20.100]  Like sometimes you do want a button that's not where the on-screen button is you want it on the side
[01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:26.420]  Where you really want it is top right when you're holding the phone with the camera lens at the top left
[01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:31.620]  Yeah, I accidentally turned the power off at least half the time right because you're trying to do this
[01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:36.100]  Yeah, and which is horrible and possibly disastrous if you're trying to capture like a fleeting moment
[01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:37.620]  so
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:43.380]  In theory if apple has a touch screen that wraps around the edge they could when you're in the camera mode
[01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:46.180]  They could make a virtual button at the top, right?
[01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:52.500]  Or just the whole phone. I mean the the penalty for shooting too many photos is pretty low, right?
[01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:57.780]  And just just delete them right and give you haptic feedback for when you actually snap the photo. Yeah
[01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:00.580]  Interesting. Yeah, that could be kind of cool
[01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:04.820]  Oh, let me tell you one of my favorite things in clips was uh,
[01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:12.020]  Let's say you string together three three pieces of video in a clip and there's that little timeline at the bottom that shows you the thumbnails
[01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:15.460]  So if you uh force touch on like the middle one
[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:18.580]  It pops up and you can drag it to reorder them
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:22.180]  And when it pops up you get like this beautiful little subtle pop
[01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:27.860]  It is a super super terrific and subtle use of uh haptic feedback
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:36.500]  I've noticed uh several app makers trying to tap into that recently. In fact, I think twitter just added
[01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:42.740]  Haptics when you star a tweet when you when you fave a tweet, which is not called faving anymore. No
[01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:47.140]  It's only works it it's always favoring in my heart
[01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:50.580]  It's still it doesn't work most of the time like it works sometimes but then
[01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:53.860]  A bunch of the time it just doesn't uh pop the yeah
[01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:56.580]  Taptic engine so I don't know
[01:25:57.620 --> 01:26:04.180]  But it's been interesting to see a lot of polar refresh haptics and yeah stuff like that
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:10.180]  What do you times it's nice but a lot of times it seems so one of the things that the galaxy s8 does and and
[01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:15.780]  One of the things that the galaxy s8 does and and in the leaked screenshot from andy rubin of their phone
[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:19.700]  Uh, which I can't help but think was was purposefully timed. Uh,
[01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:21.780]  Oh, yeah
[01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:22.980]  sub tweet
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:24.340]  All right
[01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:30.340]  And especially eric schmidt retweeting it yesterday on the day of samsung's event was yeah, you know
[01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:36.340]  Not only did eric schmidt retweet it but here he said
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:43.220]  Uh phenomenal new choices for android users coming very soon an example. It's like fu samsung
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:48.820]  Oh, then he said big week for android samsung looks great. Okay, right. Well
[01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:54.500]  Someone someone whispered in his ear. Hey, man. Do you know who sells the most android phones still?
[01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:59.700]  Yeah, he tweeted the other one first. Yeah. All right. I will I will put that in the show notes as well
[01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:03.300]  There I am i'm copying and pasting right now. This is not a lie. It's really there
[01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:05.540]  um
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:10.500]  I there's just no doubt in my mind though that I I really do. I don't think it's unfair for you to have written it
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:14.900]  I really do think that that that apple is going to be late to the edge to edge design
[01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:18.020]  I mean now maybe they've got something else and they're going to kick it to the next level
[01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:22.760]  But at the very least as things stand right now today at the end of march 2017
[01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:25.460]  apple is
[01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:27.780]  Behind the curve on the size of the bezels of the iphone
[01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:33.300]  Maybe the most convincing kind of counter argument to that was well
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:35.940]  Yeah, but then in december they'll have the newest one
[01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:42.580]  Which is true and that's when they sell the most phones in the fourth quarter. So they will have the newest one, but
[01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:49.060]  I don't know. I don't think it looks great. This is uh, this is similar to when they would you know when they used to
[01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:54.980]  Sometimes come close to not destroying their quarterly numbers relative to
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:28:00.340]  Wall street's expectations and the whole point is that apple is you know an exceptional company
[01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:03.940]  They're supposed to destroy expectations right not just come close to them. So
[01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:07.460]  Do you think they will
[01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:10.820]  See the the andy rubin one's interesting because it now has a curved
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:16.820]  Corners of the screen too. Do you think we'll see rounded just about to ask where's an ios?
[01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:19.620]  We'll take a look at it. The s8 has round corners, too
[01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:27.380]  I don't know if that is a trend or with the andy rubin one if you guys look at it
[01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:32.580]  Who knows maybe we can we can get this maybe you can just look down at your phone and and we'll there's fancy new stuff
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:34.980]  Fancy technology we can do in these podcasts right now
[01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:40.820]  We could in theory be showing you andy rubin's leaked shot right now. Just look at your phone
[01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:44.420]  You may not even have to go to a website try that. We'll see if we can get this to work
[01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:52.100]  With the andy rubin one it literally is edge to edge there is no chin or forehead or at least there's no forehead
[01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:55.540]  We can't see the chin, but there's no forehead chins like three
[01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:59.460]  Inches, right? So the corners on on the phone that he leaked half
[01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:06.420]  The corners of the display have to be rounded unless you are going to make a sharp cornered edge phone
[01:29:07.540 --> 01:29:14.020]  Which is possible i've seen some sony phones that have like actual squared off corners that that look good. Um,
[01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:20.260]  But it has to be rounded samsung seems more like a design choice like they wanted to round them off
[01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:26.980]  I honestly don't know what to think about that. I I it doesn't really make sense to me in ios because things go corner to corner
[01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:28.980]  I mean look at where the battery
[01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:34.740]  Icon and the little dots to indicate your cell signal are I mean there's no room to round those off
[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:37.620]  And I don't want them squished towards the middle
[01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:44.660]  Was it palm was it web os that had the rounded corners too? Well the original macintosh did
[01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:46.900]  true true
[01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:50.420]  Um, and in more recently, yeah, uh
[01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:57.000]  The the mac the classic mac had rounded off corners, but the display wasn't really rounded off. They were rounded off virtually
[01:29:57.700 --> 01:30:02.660]  It actually just painted black pixels in the corner to give the overall display
[01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:06.180]  I remember that during startup like you just sometimes you'd start up and it was
[01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:13.940]  Square and then you'd right get the and you could see it when you moved the mouse to the corner corner too because the the
[01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:19.540]  The the white mask around the black arrow would still light up around the corner if I recall
[01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:26.660]  Just so that you could still see the mouse if it was hidden in the corner because if they just painted it
[01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:31.700]  If it went underneath the black you might not see the mouse on screen if I recall correctly
[01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:38.260]  I don't know. I don't know what to think about that. It's sort of I I certainly don't think they should fake round the corners
[01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:40.900]  I think if they could make them square they should be able to make them square
[01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:45.460]  They should fake round the corners. I think if they could make them square they should but I don't know
[01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:47.460]  It seems like a trend this year at least
[01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:52.100]  Yeah, samsung and and they're actually using that forehead and chin
[01:30:53.380 --> 01:30:57.380]  As kind of a branding thing somewhere around the office. I just saw like a booklet
[01:30:57.700 --> 01:31:01.060]  I guess they gave out yesterday of like the design process of the
[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:04.340]  S8 and they they're really highlighting that
[01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:07.300]  forehead and chin, um as like
[01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:10.340]  Line art it's kind of interesting. Yeah, it's a distinctive look
[01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:14.900]  I mean it, you know, and it certainly can't be accused of copying apple on that on that front
[01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:19.620]  A couple of the other things that stuck out to me though with the s8 is that the
[01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:23.460]  Removal of the or or not removal because it does have a chin and forehead
[01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:28.980]  But the forehead and chin they are symmetric they're they're the same size
[01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:32.500]  But the forehead is so small that no longer they've this is the first flagship phone
[01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:36.180]  They've ever made that doesn't have a big ugly samsung logo printed on the front
[01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:37.620]  and
[01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:43.700]  I think it's so funny that of all the things that they copied shamelessly from apple over the years the one thing they never could
[01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:49.460]  Bring themselves to do is to have the human brand humility to ship a phone without a logo on the front face
[01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:54.580]  I've never understood that because and a because I think
[01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:57.780]  It the fun. I don't want to see a logo on the front face
[01:31:57.780 --> 01:32:03.620]  I really want the content and it goes back to you and me talking about the black versus white borders around the screen
[01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:08.900]  About the black versus white borders around the screen. I just don't want anything to distract me from the content
[01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:11.220]  um
[01:32:11.220 --> 01:32:14.180]  But secondarily it their their logo is fucking ugly
[01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:20.980]  It's an ugly ass logo totally and these phones and especially tablets are often used both
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:26.260]  Horizontally and vertically and so the logo can't be right all the time
[01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:32.440]  And I realized that yes apple prints their apple logo on the back of the iphone and every time you hold the phone sideways
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:37.560]  The logo is sideways, but it's not it's not facing me. It's facing out
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:40.760]  You know and there's you know, i'm not saying they shouldn't do it
[01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:46.120]  I mean people obviously love the the apple logo on their phones because so many of the cases I see have a circle cut out
[01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:48.280]  Of it for the for the damn thing
[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:52.040]  Um
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:56.360]  So I thought that was weird. There's no there's no uh, not weird but notable that there's no uh,
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:33:01.800]  Samsung logo on the front face and then the other thing is that the the chin is so small that there's no longer a physical home
[01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:06.600]  Button or fingernail or fingerprint sensor on it gets too small presumably
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.720]  So now they've moved the fingerprint sensor to the back
[01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:15.640]  And it's off center to the side of the camera lens, which is totally a gross design in my opinion
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:18.200]  Yeah
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:22.360]  That's not that's not good I have the google pixel, uh
[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:29.400]  And it's a it's my favorite android device i've ever used and that has a fingerprint sensor in the back of the phones
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:32.280]  It's roughly like where the apple logo is on a on an iphone
[01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:34.920]  Um, but at least it's centered
[01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:38.760]  I I don't love it. I think it's worse than having it on the bottom of the phone
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:43.320]  um, but it's okay, but at least it's centered and at least it isn't going to
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:46.600]  Cover up the camera lens, you know when you're using it
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:53.240]  Where does the speaker grow in the in the front face and camera does that go
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:57.080]  In the top of the phone or is that just built in with no grill on it?
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:00.760]  I think it's I think it's at the top of the phone. I it's hard to tell at least
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:05.640]  When you look there were there were leaks of samsung s8s that had a white face
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:09.640]  And you could see there's a whole bunch of holes in the top a whole bunch of sensors up there
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:13.240]  but it looks to me like and again getting back to black versus white I think all of the
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:17.560]  Samsung galaxy s8s with the various color backs all have a black front
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:20.920]  Unless i'm unless I miss something
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:24.600]  I don't know
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:29.880]  But I think that's all at the top and they're you know, presumably a microphone at the end speakers at the bottom, too
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:32.040]  I don't know
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:39.640]  The one last weird thing I know about the s8 is that they've added a dedicated hardware button for bixby
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:49.640]  Yeah, that seems like a mistake because i'm guessing bixby is going to be crap is that the one that uses the
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:52.520]  siri guy's thing or no
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:53.880]  The
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:55.720]  No, I'd well, I don't know
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:59.080]  I don't know if they've had time to integrate that. So what was that?
[01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:00.920]  It was like the second
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:05.720]  The guy who invented the team that invented original siri sold it to apple was with apple for a while
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:07.960]  And then they all left and started a new thing
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:11.560]  Along the same lines again and samsung acquired them. Uh
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:18.120]  I don't know if bixby's based on that already or if that's too soon and they weren't but haven't been able to integrate it
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:20.120]  But presumably if it's not already
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:22.120]  It will soon
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:25.320]  Seems like a weird thing to have a dedicated hardware button for
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:35.000]  Yeah, I can't viv was the name of the other one there we see i'm looking at uh,
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:42.280]  It certainly it doesn't seem to me results. It doesn't seem to me that that the features they're saying that uh,
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:46.600]  That bixby does doesn't sound anything like the stuff that viv was doing
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:50.360]  Like viv was doing some pretty complex stuff like booking flights for you
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:53.720]  And
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:57.000]  Bixby seems more like take me back to my inbox type stuff
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:00.040]  Sounds like bixby is not a viv
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:02.760]  Thing yet, right?
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:07.080]  and I don't know if it becomes viv power or if viv replaces bixby or
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:09.960]  I don't know
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:13.960]  Someone said yesterday get me the first app that will remap that button to
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:19.720]  Get me the first app that will remap that button to summon google assistant. So I could skip skip all this
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:25.080]  Crap, anyway, I was wondering if somebody would figure out a way to hack it to map it to be a camera shutter
[01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:27.800]  Oh because that's the one thing
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:33.640]  If if I were going to add another button to the iphone I would probably I don't know that I need that I would
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:38.040]  But if you said you have to add a button and it does something i'd say we'll make it a camera shutter
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:41.160]  And if the camera's not open and I hit it, it'll jump me to the camera
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:44.440]  Yeah, the phones used to have that yes a lot of uh
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:49.400]  I think the apple never did it but uh, microsoft phones did it I think
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:53.800]  The the windows phones had had shutters
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:37:01.240]  The one button the iphone has that most other phones don't have but I love it is the uh mute switch
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:08.440]  Yes, I don't understand why the other I don't understand why other phones don't have a mute switch. I love the mute switch
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:16.680]  I can't I cannot believe that all these other phones to mute the phone. You've got to actually use the screen even if it's a pretty simple
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:19.880]  Unlock it swipe down
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:24.200]  Tap the you know, like the equivalent of putting airplane mode on an iphone
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:29.480]  I'm not saying it's onerous, but I I don't know I use the mute switch so many times and
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:35.400]  If i'm in a situation where I definitely just want my phone to be muted. I love that I can do it without looking at it
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:40.440]  It's kind of the one thing you'd want to be able to do without looking at the phone right making sure that it's not going to
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:45.560]  Embarrass you in the meeting you're in right or like you're at a wedding or something like that and you're like
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:49.240]  Just let me double check for the 30th time that my phone is definitely mute
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:55.400]  Yeah, I hate I hate that they took it off the ipad because there I would use it for I do too orientation lock
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:38:01.080]  Nope, and to me that's a very very everyday feature. Yeah, it was for me, too
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:06.840]  And it's actually one of the reasons i've i've stuck with to again a throwback to an hour ago on the show
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:12.520]  It's why my ipad mini still has a mute switch and I love it. So you had the mini too. Yeah, I guess so
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:19.160]  Yeah, uh, I guess it's the first retina mini. I think that's what i've got whatever the first the mini the mini two
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:22.120]  It's like unlike with the iphone or maybe the three I have
[01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:27.320]  I have everything I can tell you like what was new in every single iphone like with the iphone
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:32.360]  I don't I have no idea. They're all just like I know what they looked like but it's like telling the one mini from another
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:36.520]  All I know is that they used to not have retina screens and now they have retina screens
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:39.880]  And everything else is sort of irrelevant to me
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:44.200]  Anyway
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:48.920]  Uh, I guess the only other thing I want to talk about with samsung is that samsung's obviously done a lot of press
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:52.920]  Through they're they're not hiding the fact that that their last phone was a huge
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:58.600]  Embarrassment and had a a incredibly expensive. Uh, recall. Um
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:03.960]  They there was a uh, great story. I thought in the verge by
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:10.040]  I think it was dan seyford. Let me double check before I keep going where he actually
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:12.760]  flew over to
[01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:18.600]  Korea to to visit with samsung and see like the the testing rigs they have available
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:23.080]  For the battery. Yes. It was dan seyford at the verge. Got a link in the show notes. Um
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:32.120]  You know, they're obviously doing press specifically to assuage people's fears that uh, that these might explode
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:41.560]  Because it's one thing to have a product recall because it was a lemon just in period like like let's say the problem is
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:44.280]  Too many of these phones that the screens just die
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:49.320]  And just turned, you know total total blowout of the screen and it just screen won't turn on they had to recall
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:52.920]  All of these phones. Well, that would be a huge expensive, you know
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:57.160]  Pr disaster, but at least nobody is has is at risk of getting hurt
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:01.800]  Right, your house isn't going to burn down if if that's the problem with the phone the defect
[01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:07.240]  Whereas if the problem if the defect with the phone is that the battery might explode and catch fire
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:10.760]  That's that's actually you know, that's a problem with the phone
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:16.760]  But if the device doesn't explode and catch fire, that's that's actually, you know, dangerous
[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:20.040]  Yeah, it's good. I mean
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:25.880]  Obviously, you don't want that to happen, but it's good to show off. Although presumably some of those tests were run
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:31.000]  Or I don't know I uh, I guess I should admit I have not read the article yet
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:38.040]  I don't know if these are new tests or if these tests were also performed on the yeah, I don't know about that either fire prone
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:41.480]  The one thing I will read it now when it's in the show notes. Yeah
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:48.600]  I did hear I heard from a friend at apple who works with or knows a a
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:51.560]  Battery engineer at apple so it's second hand
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:56.520]  But that when these when the scandal first started breaking there was a team of battery engineers at apple are like well
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:59.560]  We got it. Let's just see what this is like and not as like an official
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:04.120]  part of apple's competitive, you know, uh,
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:10.920]  What would you call it uh backwards engineering but just out of their own curiosity a couple of battery engineers at apple bought a
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:16.600]  Note seven and opened it up and like looked at the battery and they were like appalled
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:19.720]  They were like this is I cannot believe they put this battery in this case
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:27.560]  That it was it seemed very, you know, just you know, obviously these the people making this judgment are battery engineers
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:29.560]  So they it's not like me and you looking at it
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:35.880]  it's not like me and you looking at it, but that there were at you know aspects of the size and dimensions of the battery and
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:38.120]  the size of the enclosure
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:41.160]  that it seemed like the the it just
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:45.720]  Just eyeballing it as an expert. This seems like it's at risk of the sort of
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:54.120]  Positive and negative parts of the battery touching each other that you just can't can't happen with a lithium-ion battery
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:59.880]  You know and there were you know reports that afterwards, you know, and there were other news reports from sources in samsung
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:04.440]  That it was you know, it's sort of a company culture type because this is the curiosity i've had
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:08.440]  Is did samsung just get unlucky and this could have just as easily happened to apple
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.560]  Or was there is there a real was there a real structural problem within samsung that led to this?
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:16.520]  And I think that I think the answer is the latter that there were
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:18.760]  You know
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:22.520]  Management saying we want a battery of x megawatt hours
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:27.480]  Megawatt hours so we can get this amount of battery life, but we want the phone to be this thin
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:30.520]  just make it happen and
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:37.000]  Over the objections of their samsung's own engineers. They went ahead with a design that they knew should have they should have known was risky
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:43.240]  Because part of the promotion for the s8 is they're even saying look this has a smaller battery
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:48.920]  But you can bring it on a plane yeah
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:53.640]  That's probably the worst that is probably the worst promotional part of the whole s7 disaster are those
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:59.560]  Those reminders when you you're at the because they it's not just like one time they tell you before you board the plane
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:01.880]  They tell you when you're on the plane
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:05.560]  It's what I think they're over though. I haven't heard one. Yeah, I think they are too
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:10.040]  I think that you know, thankfully at least they recalled all I think all the phones are right
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:12.200]  Most of the phones have been recalled at this point
[01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:17.400]  But I did I took a couple of flights where that happened and it was it was really pretty brutal constantly
[01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:19.560]  Yeah. All right. Let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor

[01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:58.200]  Uh, what else we got we got a few more things and we got to wrap it up how about this
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:00.520]  You see this twitter stuff
[01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:04.360]  Which which twitter stuff? I don't I don't know. There's a couple of things with twitter. What are you talking about?
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:08.840]  It looks like today, especially in the ios, although you're all third-party app, right? Yeah
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:11.560]  They've uh, I saw your tweet
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:16.760]  Yeah, I think I think you're good. You're I think I know what you're talking about. Go ahead though. They've
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:21.080]  They've kind of changed the way that replies work and look
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:23.480]  so when you
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:25.480]  Yeah, that was their go to reply to someone
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:28.120]  You don't see their
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:31.640]  Handles in the reply anymore. It's like a second level of metadata
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:34.920]  And what they've also done is open up the character limit so you can now
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:42.840]  Type a full 140 character reply instead of the handles counting toward the character limit. Yeah
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:47.800]  But man, is it weird to get used to and it looks like they actually changed it
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:50.680]  I noticed at first in the mac app
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:54.360]  And they weren't showing the handles at all. They were showing
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.760]  people's
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:02.440]  handles full names and just super strange and
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:04.520]  kind of
[01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:06.520]  new but not great ui
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:12.280]  And just ugly and it looks like today they turned it on in ios too. So now
[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:16.040]  a huge percentage of twitter users are seeing this stuff
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:18.120]  but
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:21.320]  Uh, you know, I don't know. I don't know if this is the kind of thing where they think
[01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:25.320]  Oh, wow twitter is going to be so much less confusing now to new users or
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:28.440]  or what or if they really just wanted to strip the
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:31.000]  metadata of
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.440]  reply handles out of the tweet and put it in a different place, but
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:39.640]  It's kind of gross. Yeah, it's I I feel like they've
[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:42.280]  they've
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:49.720]  Talked themselves into knots over what the problems are with twitter and that they've convinced themselves that things that are
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:54.520]  Not the problem with twitter are the problem with twitter and there's those are the problems they're tackling
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:56.680]  And if anything, I think they're just making it worse
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:59.000]  I I
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:04.760]  It doesn't make any sense to me and it doesn't even seem efficient like the screenshot you posted in your tweet was like in reply
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:05.960]  to
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:10.360]  Uh joe smith and one other and so instead of showing at joe smith
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:13.160]  It actually says his name capital joe
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:20.360]  Capital s smith and one other and then you tap that and it shows you the other in like a pop-up
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:24.360]  But it's like it would have taken just as much space just to show both usernames right like
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:29.640]  Like I understand in the case where if maybe there's seven people in a reply chain
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:35.640]  Which is already a mess on twitter, but I can see how of course everyone is doing today now these endless canoes
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:39.480]  so I could see how if it said in reply to dan frohmer and
[01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:43.400]  five others that five others is clearly
[01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:50.840]  More condensed than actually listing all six usernames and then tapping that to show a list of all six is is a reasonable ui
[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:56.440]  But when it just has one other it's like you've you've you've done them. You've made a terrible mistake
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:01.480]  Yeah, the other thing I noticed the other day is if you try to string
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:04.200]  Tweets together it was auto
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:10.840]  Inserting the period handle thing at the beginning of the tweet, which was a bad hack to begin with
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:13.960]  And it was then part of the actual
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:16.760]  the actual creation of the tweet, so
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:17.720]  Yeah
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:18.520]  uh
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:24.440]  I should i'm looking at the twitter app right now and I it makes me think that I should spend a couple of days using
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:26.600]  It because I think i'm so out of date
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:32.760]  That i'm i'm lost and I feel like people always ask me like why don't you just use tweetbot and
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:37.720]  I suppose I should I I actually really like using default apps because
[01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:42.280]  Especially as someone whose job is to kind of analyze and write about this industry
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:45.320]  It's helpful for me to see what most people are going through
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:51.480]  Yeah, I try to change as few things about my mac as possible and iphone and that kind of stuff, too
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:57.400]  And also the old twitter for mac, which was tweety for mac originally
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:03.480]  A fine lauren brichter creation to me was the best twitter interface. Yes
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:08.440]  The way that it flows in real time and responses are included in there to me
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:11.080]  especially if you follow as many accounts as I do which is
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:18.360]  Currently five thousand one hundred and four there's just always information flowing through and it to me is the best
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:26.760]  Look at what twitter really is just this constant conversation of people and sometimes they're talking to each other and sometimes they're talking to themselves
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:29.720]  But it just really was awesome in the way that it was animated
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:33.560]  It's just better to me than any other twitter ui. Um
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:39.320]  But if this twitter for mac app now is just such a disaster, so I don't know
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:42.280]  And twitter for iphone
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:45.800]  Doesn't have it. It's just twitter for mac and twitter for iphone
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:51.240]  I I see how they're taking the at out of the tweets, but it says replying to at grueber
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:54.440]  It doesn't say replying to john grueber. So I believe that
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:50:00.920]  That changed in let's see if that changed in twitter from mac today. No, it still says rep replying to dave pell
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:05.880]  Yeah, but that's on the mac. So on mac, so maybe they'll sync it up
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:09.880]  I mean, this is I I believe the mac app is now a third-party creation
[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:13.080]  Made by an agency. So
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:16.600]  Maybe they're on a week-old. Uh, yeah
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:19.240]  So maybe my whining helped. I don't know
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:24.440]  Probably not but even I I understand I totally understand and that's why i'm saying I think I should spend some time using
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:31.720]  Twitter.app just because I think I should be familiar with it too knowing, you know, just to write reasonably about twitter
[01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:36.920]  And it is diverging further and further from the third-party clients because the third-party clients are limited
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:41.400]  I I think that they're made by people with better design sense than twitter's designers
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:44.520]  But be they're limited by the apis and they can't do that
[01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:50.600]  They can't really do a lot of the things the twitter client is doing and so they're sort of stuck with the old twitter metaphor
[01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:56.760]  But I think it's I think it's for the better I don't yeah
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:03.320]  Did you see that the the granddaddy of all third-party clients twitterrific, uh,
[01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:08.920]  They they hadn't updated their mac version in awasan, but because of the economics, you know
[01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:16.440]  That the their iphone version is the most popular and that's where their engineering time went. Um, but they did a kickstarter to raise money
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:22.280]  To to modernize the mac version of twitterrific and it got fully funded. So it's good news
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:26.440]  I don't think I got in on that though. So now i'm mad
[01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:29.240]  Yeah, I should have
[01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:33.480]  Well now now now I wish I had it but yeah, but whenever they finished I think you know, you could still buy it
[01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:40.280]  It's this whole thing is because of the idiotic cap on user numbers that third-party clients are allowed to have like right
[01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:46.200]  But there's to me is just so out of date like twitter and twitter. I think now needs to really
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:51.720]  Open itself up to third-party apps again because the first party ones are
[01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:54.920]  Not super great. Yeah, I I
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:51:59.720]  They're you know, they're not super great
[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:08.280]  Yeah, I I they're yeah, I understand where what they were looking around at as facebook certainly
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:13.560]  Took off, you know circa 2013 2014
[01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:16.360]  I don't know when twitter did the api thing
[01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:21.560]  But you could see where facebook was going and facebook wasn't a thing where there were third-party clients for facebook
[01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:23.640]  Everything for facebook goes through facebook
[01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:24.840]  uh
[01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:30.440]  And and i'm I honestly think that's just what motivated like well facebook is forcing everybody to use facebook
[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:32.920]  So we should twitter should be a thing where you have to use twitter
[01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:37.240]  um, but I feel like that's where they started going off the rails because they were losing
[01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:42.360]  Twitter the company was losing sense of what it was that made twitter great, which is just the
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.480]  The network and the simplicity of the format
[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:52.680]  That it's just hey whose tweets do I want to see here are the tweets from those people here they are
[01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:54.520]  And here's the tweets that are mentioning you
[01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:59.880]  Uh, I feel like everything they've done to get away from that has been a mistake
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:07.880]  You know, I used to be able to use facebook through a third-party adobe air
[01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:11.480]  Tweet deck really? I think that's gone. Yeah
[01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:14.360]  I think that's long gone now. I don't know. Hmm
[01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:21.560]  Um, yeah, I totally agree and you know some of the stuff they've done like the live video it's interesting to see them
[01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:28.760]  Chase after that and actually, uh found a twitter moment to be very useful once when I missed a big news story
[01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:31.240]  And wanted to catch up on it quickly and I just looked
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:37.320]  In twitter moments and sure enough there it was and it explained the whole thing to me. But actually one thing I I see people
[01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:43.560]  Saying sometimes in twitter, which is the the most useful feature they could create is a
[01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:47.800]  An explanation for why everyone's pissed at this one person right now
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:53.880]  That's me like why is everyone shit talking this one guy that would be a useful feature in the twitter app
[01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:59.080]  Oh, he did this thing. Okay. How do you get to twitter moments in the in the iphone app? I don't even know
[01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:03.080]  Well, they they re-hit it now you have to go into this explore
[01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:07.720]  Page and then most that top one I think is a moment. Oh, all right
[01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:12.680]  But I don't know. Oh, I see you scroll down and it has today's moments. I got it. Yeah explore
[01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:15.480]  They've definitely made it harder to find them which does not
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:23.080]  Play well to their long-term future. Maybe I don't know. I think eventually they're supposed to be in the in the feed. But yeah
[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:25.960]  Well, I don't know
[01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:27.960]  Good luck to twitter
[01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:33.720]  Yeah, uh, i've got one more sponsor to thank and and then we can we can do whatever our last segment of the show's going
[01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:36.920]  To be but I gotta thank our good friends at squarespace
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:42.920]  Make your next move when you do you need a new website make it at squarespace
[01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:47.240]  Everything you need to do to create a new website. You can do it squarespace. You can just get your domain name
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:49.080]  You can get the domain name now
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:53.080]  If you think of a good domain name go to squarespace register it and you can just have like a placeholder
[01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:55.240]  But don't lose that domain name. You could do that
[01:54:55.800 --> 01:55:00.280]  You can set up a store. You can set up a blog you set up a podcast
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:07.560]  You can set up like if you're a artist or a freelance designer or something like that. You can set up a portfolio site
[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:10.360]  Anything like that, you can set up a website
[01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:12.280]  Uh portfolio site
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:16.040]  Anything like that you could do it at squarespace. How do you how do you create a squarespace site?
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:22.600]  Do you edit a bunch of php files and uh use a sftp program to upload them to a server?
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:27.720]  And no you don't do that. You just log right into squarespace and you do it right in the browser
[01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:31.880]  You make a website on the website and you want to move something from the left to the right
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:34.040]  You don't like enter a bunch of code
[01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:36.840]  You just drag it from the left to the right if you want to add
[01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:42.360]  A different component you just drag it out put it on the page where you want it. There it is. They have so many
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.920]  professionally designed templates to choose from
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:49.000]  That it's it. You probably don't even know you probably use squarespace sites all the time
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:53.000]  You don't even know you're using squarespace sites. It's not like oh, there's a look like oh
[01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:58.760]  This is exactly what a squarespace site looks like. It's not like that at all because they have so many templates
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:01.560]  Really a terrific product
[01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:07.480]  Uh, and the quickest way to get from the notion that you need a website for something
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:12.360]  Or you want to replace the existing website for something with a new one to actually having it
[01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:16.920]  And one of the best things about it is they have award-winning technical support
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:19.800]  You just get them on the horn and you're talking to them
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:22.680]  And if you have a problem, like you don't know you can't figure out how to do something
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:24.200]  uh
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:25.240]  it's
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:29.800]  They'll they've got 24 hour a day tech support and they tell you how to do it couldn't be easier
[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:31.800]  So next time you need a website
[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:37.640]  Give squarespace a shot first. Just go there and spend an hour trying to build your thing at website at squarespace
[01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:42.440]  You'll probably be done by the end of the hour and you won't even get to plan b for how you're going to do it
[01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:47.880]  Go to squarespace.com to check it out. And then when you do buy you can start for free by the way

[01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:14.760]  Ah anything else on the agenda got to figure out something. What about this? Tell me what's that? You tell me
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.720]  Well, there's the do you see the video I put in the show notes with?
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:23.480]  These two guys up in canada did a head-to-head comparison of of android auto versus car carplay
[01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:29.800]  I did that was good. It was devastating and i'm a guy who in general is on the hey
[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:35.000]  Everybody says siri is total garbage. I I disagree. There's you know, I find siri useful
[01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:40.440]  in xyz and it works really well for me and every time I ask for a support score I
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  get a up to the minute score and
[01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:46.600]  It's great at the weather and and this that and the other thing
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:51.400]  But this I don't my I don't have anything like autoplay or carplay in my car
[01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:54.760]  My car is from 2006. So it's I don't even have like a
[01:57:56.920 --> 01:58:01.560]  Like a way to pump music through my stereo, um, I should probably get a new car but
[01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:07.160]  So I don't have first-hand experience with this but this head-to-head video up. I will put it in the show notes
[01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:13.320]  Absolutely devastating. This isn't like oh for a b and c android auto is better
[01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:18.600]  But for d e and f car plays better and this this was just a wipeout
[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:26.360]  This is like android auto is like pretty useful and seems to do exactly what you want it to do if with a little bit of lag
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:29.160]  You know that I think like 10 years from now
[01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:34.600]  We're going to look back and say I cannot believe how much lag there was on the voice input for these things
[01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:43.400]  Versus carplay which was like totally busted. I mean like failed at everything failed to send the guy text messages couldn't understand his friend's name
[01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:45.800]  there was no way to like
[01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:49.000]  Convinced siri of what his friend's name was
[01:58:49.640 --> 01:58:55.180]  They asked for directions to something nearby up in canada and it was routing them to like toledo, ohio
[01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:01.160]  It was really bad
[01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:04.920]  yeah, you know, I I don't have a car so I don't know I don't have either of these things but
[01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:09.100]  It just seems to show that a lot of these services
[01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:14.840]  lack context in even the most basic of queries and
[01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:18.040]  You know that they're supposed to be getting better at that like siri sometimes can
[01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:20.760]  Respond to your previous query
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.320]  knowing that yeah, that's the context but
[01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:28.200]  All the time I try using amazon alexa. I try using siri to
[01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:32.600]  Ask about the previous query and almost never is it
[01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:35.320]  working to my kind of desired
[01:59:36.040 --> 01:59:40.600]  Level of context and I guess that'll get better over time and this is pretty simple
[01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:43.560]  I mean this should just know that they're in canada. So maybe the closest
[01:59:43.560 --> 01:59:48.200]  the the whatever you want to call it the relevance of of search results is
[01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:55.160]  Probably more based on location than on what's the number one ranking for this global search term?
[01:59:56.040 --> 01:59:57.480]  I don't know
[01:59:57.480 --> 02:00:02.360]  I don't know. It seems like apple really has its work cut out for in this regard honestly from this demo video
[02:00:02.360 --> 02:00:08.360]  I mean, I don't know if this is not representative and it and it seemed like what it was was two guys
[02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:12.200]  Go check it. You know, I'll put it again. I'll put the video in the show as you can check it out
[02:00:12.200 --> 02:00:15.240]  But it's like the you know, it seemed like a very fair thing
[02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:18.520]  It wasn't like they were out to get carplay seemed like the one guy is an iphone fan
[02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:21.640]  the other guy's an android fan and and so the
[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:26.440]  The you know, the one guy was you know, you know, it was sort of like a little friendly wager type thing
[02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:34.280]  But so the guy who was trying to get carplay to do things was trying his best like he really wanted it to to to work
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:38.440]  And I really don't think there was a single thing they did that was unfair at all
[02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:40.440]  Anyway pretty bad
[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:44.040]  uh last thing I had was this whole thing with the uh
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:51.960]  The isps and privacy and this ridiculous law that that the us congress passed yesterday
[02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:54.920]  You saw this right?
[02:00:54.920 --> 02:01:01.980]  Yeah, where there was a an under the obama administration that the fcc passed a thing that would prevent
[02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:04.700]  Isps and and like cell phone providers
[02:01:04.700 --> 02:01:11.580]  Would prevent isps and and like cell phone providers from using your your your web traffic history
[02:01:12.780 --> 02:01:16.940]  To sell to advertisers or other people who'd be interested in knowing
[02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:20.060]  Everything you've done on the internet
[02:01:20.060 --> 02:01:21.340]  uh
[02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:22.940]  and the
[02:01:22.940 --> 02:01:25.580]  us congress and the the senate passed
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:30.860]  Legislation abolishing this which is ridiculous and it was completely alone again
[02:01:30.860 --> 02:01:33.260]  I don't want to get too much into the politics of it. I mean
[02:01:33.260 --> 02:01:34.300]  I mean
[02:01:34.300 --> 02:01:36.300]  A partisanship of it
[02:01:36.380 --> 02:01:41.600]  But every single person in the senate and the house who voted for it was a republican
[02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:48.140]  And not a single democrat voted for it. And I think there were only 15 republicans who voted against it
[02:01:48.940 --> 02:01:53.660]  but it's the most ridiculous like this issue should not be partisan like
[02:01:54.540 --> 02:01:56.540]  Somebody who is a died
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:01:58.840]  die-hard republican
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:05.720]  Uh, but doesn't like own stock and comcast but just just is a republican and believes in you know, like low taxes
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:08.520]  And all the other, you know
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:11.160]  Strong defense spending and etc etc down the line
[02:02:11.700 --> 02:02:12.840]  politically
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:19.100]  Uh, there's no way that they're in favor of their cell phone providers selling their browsing history to advertisers
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:21.560]  Like this is not a conservative issue
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:29.320]  It's absolutely unconscionable that that this passed and you know, surprise surprise guess who's a big spender on lobbying?
[02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:32.360]  In washington dc the the telecom industry
[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:39.720]  Yeah, what's interesting is that the whatever was passed and i'm not an expert in this so
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:42.760]  Whatever but
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:46.760]  What was passed under obama, I guess never actually took effect. So
[02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:49.960]  Nothing's actually getting worse. It's just not getting better
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:51.960]  And I don't know
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:59.640]  if the telcos were actually taking advantage of their capabilities in this regard before or if it was just you know,
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:04.840]  Something that they wanted to do. So it's not like some liberty was
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:10.600]  Technically taken away. Although I guess it was supposed to kick in at some point and then and now won't
[02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:13.480]  But it's crazy to me that
[02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:17.960]  Any of these companies could say this is in the best interest of private. Like what were they saying like
[02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:23.640]  Of choice or something like that. Yeah. Yeah, just fucking say you want to make some money
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:27.480]  Just be honest about it. Yeah
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:30.520]  Right. Yeah, this is a new business line for us and you know
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:34.600]  Deal we we run the pipe we can do whatever we want with it. Um
[02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:40.920]  But I guess they can't say that right? Well sam biddle at the intercept. I will put a link to this in the show
[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:47.560]  Notes as well. Did did the yeoman's work as a reporter and what what the what is it? The group is called the
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.960]  Ncta, I don't know what that stands for though. Um
[02:03:53.560 --> 02:03:58.680]  I don't it probably used to stand for something and now does not but well, it's the trade group association
[02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:01.960]  It's a lobbying group that represents companies like verizon and comcast
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:07.320]  And they were big and you know, this is the the statement after
[02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:13.400]  Last week's vote read. We appreciate today's senate action to repeal unwarranted fcc rules that deny consumers consistent
[02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:18.460]  Deny consumers consistent privacy protection online and violate competitive neutrality
[02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:26.680]  Our industry remains committed to offering services that protect the privacy and security of the personal information of our customers
[02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:30.760]  And it's so their statement is just purely it really is
[02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:38.220]  It's so their statement is just purely it really is. I I it often overused but it it really apt here orwellian
[02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:45.160]  In terms in terms of using words that mean the complete opposite of what the legislation actually did
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:50.600]  And I guess some of the argument they used was that well facebook and google can do this
[02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:55.400]  So why shouldn't we be able to but and I again, I don't know who actually made that. This is just
[02:04:56.440 --> 02:04:59.640]  my third day memory of reading articles about this but
[02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:03.240]  The truth is that they don't like facebook and google see what you're doing
[02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:08.840]  On facebook and google and maybe what you click out on but they don't get your full internet history
[02:05:08.920 --> 02:05:13.560]  Which to me is like a you know, you if you don't want to click something on facebook
[02:05:13.560 --> 02:05:18.440]  You can avoid that you can't avoid using the internet while you're on the internet. So
[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:21.640]  Seems kind of uh
[02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:24.520]  Like the kind of argument that would maybe work if you're a moron
[02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:28.280]  But if you actually know anything about how the internet works does not really work
[02:05:28.280 --> 02:05:32.760]  Right and facebook and google. There's no denying that they are they're very hard to avoid. Uh,
[02:05:33.560 --> 02:05:37.480]  You know, I just had a car. I still I don't have a facebook account
[02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:40.280]  I never have and I had a conversation with somebody
[02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:46.600]  Last week while I was at waiting to meet with people at apple and somebody who just couldn't believe it just absolutely
[02:05:46.600 --> 02:05:50.680]  You know, it was really thought I was maybe pulling their leg and i'm like no I really I don't use it
[02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:55.320]  I don't I you know kind of amazing. You can still use instagram without having a facebook account
[02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:58.920]  You know what if anything would ever get me to sign up for it would probably be that you know
[02:05:58.920 --> 02:06:04.600]  I still have I still don't see instagram ads. I've still me neither, but we got to stop telling people that
[02:06:05.640 --> 02:06:10.760]  Otherwise, we're gonna get I I know but I kind of want to see them because i'm curious but i'm worried that
[02:06:11.080 --> 02:06:15.560]  I'm gonna see one and be like, yeah, I could finally see what an instagram ad is like and then all of a sudden
[02:06:15.560 --> 02:06:20.680]  I'll be inundated with them and i'm gonna be like, oh man, remember when I I was two years into you know
[02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:24.280]  I got a really good one once I I used to see them and I got a great one
[02:06:24.280 --> 02:06:28.280]  Maybe this is when they stopped showing them to me. I got a great one for suntory whiskey
[02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:35.880]  And I thought oh finally these guys know me well suntory whiskey, but I don't see any ads anymore except now
[02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:42.360]  I see them occasionally between stories because that is a different format. I I still don't I don't see them there
[02:06:42.360 --> 02:06:47.400]  I don't think I I only rarely do so that either they don't have enough ads or
[02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:53.080]  They don't like my whatever something about me does not uh target well
[02:06:53.080 --> 02:06:54.360]  Yeah
[02:06:54.360 --> 02:07:02.200]  But again, it's it's a utility. You know what I mean? Like did they really that's why you know, and again, I I understand the general
[02:07:02.920 --> 02:07:06.600]  And in some degree I agree with it like the general republican
[02:07:07.560 --> 02:07:14.840]  Mindset is that fewer government regulations are better. It's better to let the market, you know
[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:19.080]  Work itself out and that over regulation is a problem
[02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:24.520]  Totally get that I actually agree with it. I think that you know that that you know
[02:07:24.520 --> 02:07:30.760]  It's it's when a funk when a functioning two-party system with one side being conservative one side being liberal that
[02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:34.840]  One of the even though i'm generally liberal. I think the conservatives serve a very
[02:07:35.720 --> 02:07:43.240]  Effective role at limiting the government from over regulating things. I I really do. I mean and I just renewed my driver's license
[02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:46.280]  this month and
[02:07:46.280 --> 02:07:50.840]  It's it's I I would say it is a you know, it
[02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:55.880]  Government bureaucracy can be a real problem for doing something that you have to do every couple years
[02:07:59.800 --> 02:08:04.280]  I this is a case where though like regulating things like
[02:08:05.160 --> 02:08:11.560]  the water quality and you know, like elect the electricity and and service and stuff like that
[02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:17.320]  The electricity and and service and stuff like that. There's a reason why we want the government to regulate that
[02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:17.640]  You know
[02:08:17.640 --> 02:08:22.280]  You don't want to have people getting their heat shut off in the middle of winter just because they missed a bill or something
[02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:23.320]  like that
[02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:24.200]  uh
[02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:25.240]  and
[02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:27.800]  Telecom stuff is regulated for a reason
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:31.400]  And being able to just sell your history
[02:08:32.120 --> 02:08:38.280]  Would seem to me a a clear violation of that as as a utility service and I do think our do you think our electrical?
[02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:41.720]  History is for sale. I don't know. I don't think so
[02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:48.120]  I I I don't think anybody would agree. I I and who knows I mean for all I know
[02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:50.120]  Maybe this is on the books and they're doing it
[02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:56.840]  But it's I don't think that the phone companies can sell a list of to like advertisers of who i've made phone calls to
[02:08:57.800 --> 02:09:01.640]  Yeah, right, right like you know, and then you know, that's probably the most second most
[02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:04.680]  threatening
[02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:08.600]  Right, I mean I but like and I can see competitively why you would want it
[02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:13.720]  You know like a pizza place might want to see that i'm always calling I every time I order a pizza
[02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:15.960]  I get it from the same place and they want to send me a you know
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:18.840]  Call me up and offer me a special offer or something like that
[02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:21.560]  Uh, but that would be terrible
[02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:24.360]  It'd be outrageous
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:28.280]  I find it. I find people seem to think that that vpns are the solution
[02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:33.320]  Although I don't think that's really gonna take off. I mean, yeah, I don't know if you've used the vpn ever
[02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:35.640]  but they're kind of a pain in the ass so
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:41.480]  Well, they're they're kind of a pain in the ass and it's I I don't think I don't think they should be presented as a panacea
[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:44.520]  especially if you're not the one running the vpn, you know, like
[02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:46.200]  so like
[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:51.640]  People who work at big companies like when they do work like if you work at apple and you want to work from home
[02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:54.520]  You've got to log on to the vpn because you can't even access
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:57.720]  The stuff you need if you're not because they want it to be secure
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:10:01.880]  But you can kind of trust it because it's your vpn from apple and you know
[02:10:01.880 --> 02:10:09.480]  It like as an independent person using a vpn you you're completely at the mercy of the vpn service. You're you're signing up for
[02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:14.520]  And they could you know for all you know, they're they're tracking your history or something
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:18.360]  I don't think it's a panacea and it adds some steps
[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:25.240]  I do think I do wonder if somebody like if apple could step in and do something where if
[02:10:25.720 --> 02:10:29.240]  You're using apple products and you have an apple base station
[02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:30.680]  Base station
[02:10:30.680 --> 02:10:31.640]  uh
[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:37.640]  You know, this is in the fantasy world where apple is still updating their wi-fi routers on a regular basis that they could do something
[02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:40.120]  that um
[02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:42.120]  Sort of gives you an invisible vpn
[02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:48.200]  That would that would keep your isp from being able to do this sort of intrusive privacy invasive stuff. I don't know
[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:53.240]  I don't know enough about it to say but I think I it seems to me like apple could take an interest in this
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:57.560]  That's another thing. We haven't uh has not been resolved yet
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:00.440]  The future of the airport base stations. Yeah
[02:11:00.920 --> 02:11:05.240]  Uh, but yeah, I mean or or one of the kind of enterprising new players like euro
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:10.920]  That would be a cool thing euro could do or google or or any of the new newish router providers
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:15.160]  Oh, we automatically although what I don't know. It's like if you're doing everything over a secure
[02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:20.120]  Pipe you're still sending packets over your
[02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:23.080]  Hardware network, so I don't know
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:29.720]  Like yeah, i've seen other people say and I I know that this doesn't work that if you just change your dns from your isp's
[02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:35.640]  Owned dns to like open dns or google's dns servers or something like that
[02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:37.160]  um
[02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:41.640]  That might help your service in some ways, you know, i've done that in years past
[02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:44.920]  but that doesn't solve this problem like comcast still the
[02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:52.520]  The the ones and zeros are still going over the u-porn packets are still coming over comcast. So
[02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:55.080]  It's just yeah
[02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:57.080]  I don't know. It's just sort of a depressing
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:01.800]  Amidst all the other political stuff going on. It's just a very depressing display of
[02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:05.640]  There's just nobody, you know, like even something like on the environment
[02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:13.400]  Which is obviously a political hot button hot button issue. So if if if the trump administration wants to roll back regulations on
[02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:18.840]  Uh, like pollution coal pollution into water me personally i'm opposed to that
[02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:25.240]  I I at least get the argument though that there are people who are saying but finance, you know, this can
[02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:29.960]  Change the financial dynamics of this whole town or it you know
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:34.680]  I I don't I I disagree with these people i'll even argue with them
[02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:37.400]  but I at least acknowledge that there are people who
[02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:43.080]  Are arguing that side that there are americans who are saying no, I think they should be allowed to do this
[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:48.360]  Whereas with this privacy thing, there's nobody it's absolute crickets chirping on twitter. Everybody's outraged about it
[02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:53.240]  I see tons and tons of tweets about it, and I don't see anyone anyone arguing for the other side
[02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:58.680]  Like there's nobody saying yeah, I think it's a good idea to roll back this uh,
[02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:01.560]  This this protection
[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:06.120]  It's a business that it makes it the most bizarre thing to have passed because it so clearly is
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:08.760]  Popular with nobody except the actual
[02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:11.560]  uh stakeholders in the isps
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:16.040]  Yet I don't hear I mean, you know, I see an uproar
[02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:22.840]  Among my colleagues at the verge like neil and those guys are strongly against it, but I don't I don't know
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:24.840]  I just don't see a ton of
[02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:30.440]  People talking about it. I don't know. Well, I I guess the you know, for the most part
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:37.800]  For the most part, it's not going to hit the masses until if if and when it actually starts being abused, right and you start getting
[02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:45.400]  Uh creepily super targeted stuff from comcast that saw what you were looking at on webmd, right?
[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:48.200]  And you know part of like a pill for that
[02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:53.800]  Part of it though is that we are sort of being we're like frogs being slowly boiled to death with the creepy stuff
[02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:55.880]  We do see where you know
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:14:01.400]  Uh, it's still getting worse. Although I think ever since i've installed content blockers on
[02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:05.640]  Safari it's it's actually for me personally it's gotten better
[02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:10.120]  But I know my wife is just telling me the other day where she clicked on one thing for one product
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:13.400]  And now all of the ads she sees everywhere for that product
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:17.400]  And it was totally innocuous. I forget what it was. I can't even remember
[02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:21.240]  It was it was not like in a you know, any way sensitive or embarrassing product
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:27.080]  But it was it was just unbelievable though the number of sites that were showing her ads for this thing that she had clicked on
[02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:29.160]  one time on one site
[02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:37.640]  Well, it speaks to the the effectiveness or lack thereof of web advertising that that is immediately the most effective ad
[02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:42.520]  That you could possibly see is yeah for the website you were just on but yeah
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:49.160]  All right, anything else you wanted to talk about this week I've it seems like it's time to wrap it up
[02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:54.360]  Just getting pumped for the uh second chicago cubs world series in a row, but that's about it
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:58.920]  Have you been on since the cubs won the series? I don't think you have I don't think so. No
[02:15:00.280 --> 02:15:03.960]  Congratulations. Here. We are opening day opening day this weekend. I'll collect my uh,
[02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:10.040]  And i'm currently first place in the vox media tournament bracket, but we'll see what happens
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:15.240]  Yeah opening day coming up very excited. I've got a I was I was in vegas
[02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:20.760]  Uh before the tournament and I placed a hundred dollar prop bet on unc to win the whole tournament
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:22.760]  So i've still got that going. I think it pays
[02:15:23.720 --> 02:15:29.480]  Six to one or eight to one so i've got i'll have a i'll have an eight hundred dollar ticket if if it if they win
[02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:32.360]  Cool, we'll have to go collect. Yeah
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000]  Yeah, that would be
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:37.560]  It would be a good use of that eight hundred dollars
[02:15:39.800 --> 02:15:43.160]  You can actually I was there last week, uh for a day
[02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:44.680]  and
[02:15:44.680 --> 02:15:50.200]  That was kind of fun just for work, but it was like oh I should do 24 hours in vegas more often
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:53.000]  Yeah, it's a good town to dip your toes in it is
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:57.560]  I've done that I had a flight one time we were flying to van
[02:15:57.560 --> 02:16:04.440]  Amy and I were flying to vancouver and there's no direct flights and so and it just it's a long way from philadelphia
[02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:09.400]  So we just flew to vegas spent one night in vegas and woke up at noon and flew to vancouver the next day
[02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:13.320]  And it was total fun. That's awesome total fun. Nice
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:15.720]  Whereas most cities you feel like you can't possibly
[02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:21.880]  You know really get any anything out of the city if you're only there for you know
[02:16:22.840 --> 02:16:25.640]  23 hours total whereas vegas you can easily
[02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:29.880]  You could easily say i've had enough. I had a good time and i'm done. I'm ready to go
[02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:37.480]  Cubs I can't believe that I still can't believe that they won that I mean I I can't either and it also was
[02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:41.960]  I I can't either and it also was completely ruined by the election a week later
[02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:46.920]  So I know that I had that thought I feel really screwed by that it it was
[02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:50.680]  That was
[02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:56.040]  Like it never hit me the joy never really hit me and then I got the wind knocked out of me, you know, and now
[02:16:57.080 --> 02:16:59.160]  Some days i'm like, oh, yeah, the cups won the world series
[02:16:59.480 --> 02:17:05.800]  It's sort of like playing the playing the lottery, you know every day for 108 years
[02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:10.280]  And never winning and then you finally win big and you get the money
[02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:13.880]  You get mugged for the money as you're walking out of the place where they get by a bus. Yeah
[02:17:18.120 --> 02:17:20.360]  I think the cubs look good again. That's the problem
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:26.840]  The scary part about the cubs is that it was clear even just two years ago that they that that was that was a team with
[02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:29.240]  with uh
[02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:31.240]  Team with legs with the talent on that team
[02:17:31.240 --> 02:17:36.840]  Yeah, and you know schwarber's back this year. Well, that is that's the to me was the most amazing thing
[02:17:36.840 --> 02:17:41.080]  And i've said this before and I know everybody, you know, anybody wants to tune out for the sports ball
[02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:47.880]  You can tune out but there's two types of sports fans fundamentally numbers numbers people and story people
[02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:52.600]  and like the you know, like the numbers people are like the sabermetrics people and they like to you know,
[02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:56.200]  They're you know using spreadsheets to pick their fantasy stuff and whatever
[02:17:56.200 --> 02:18:01.960]  I I love math. I was really good at math when I was in school. I kind of like the stats of sports
[02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:06.840]  But to me the reason I like to still like to watch them though are the stories I liked it's it's
[02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:14.600]  And I don't care if the sabermetrics better explains who wins I like the stories as an explanation for who wins and of course
[02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:15.480]  20 20
[02:18:15.480 --> 02:18:20.040]  Hindsight but to me the moment I thought that the cubs were going to win was when schwarber came back
[02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:26.360]  It's who comes back from like a terrible injury and months of not even swinging a bat and your first
[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:31.480]  Re-entry into the sport is at the highest possible level the world series
[02:18:32.280 --> 02:18:35.480]  And then the guy knocks the shit out of the ball for the whole series
[02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:41.640]  It's crazy it it defies everything I know about professional baseball, which is that
[02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:46.600]  For hitting even if you're super talented and you're athletically in the prime of your career
[02:18:46.600 --> 02:18:53.000]  Your timing is everything and it's the whole reason they have this month-long spring training. Is that getting your timing down?
[02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:59.160]  Is intricate and it's so easily lost and it's the worst thing about getting hurt even for like six weeks
[02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:03.080]  Is that you come back and you're sure your knees better now, but your timing is off
[02:19:03.640 --> 02:19:09.560]  And when people are throwing the ball at you at 97 miles an hour your timing being off just a little bit is
[02:19:09.800 --> 02:19:13.240]  You're you're done and schwarber comes back and it's unbelievable
[02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:16.360]  I it's amazing. I I kind of want to go watch that game now
[02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:20.120]  It made me that's what made me think that they were going to win because the story just fit
[02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:25.720]  It's like it's it's you know, it's the cinderella cinderella story, you know, the kid comes back, you know
[02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:29.240]  Because what a heartbreak it would have been if he hadn't played in the world series, right you get a knee injury
[02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:31.720]  and and uh
[02:19:31.720 --> 02:19:37.560]  You're on the cubs and the cubs win their first world series in four hundred and seventy seven years and and you didn't get to play
[02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:39.560]  But instead he came back in the middle of the game
[02:19:39.560 --> 02:19:46.440]  And and you didn't get to play but instead he came back in the most dramatic fashion possible. So anyway, congratulations. I can't
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:50.120]  Can't say I don't have any bones to pick with the cubs. Congrats
[02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:55.480]  Oh, we'll do it again
[02:19:56.680 --> 02:20:02.280]  That would be the worst if the cubs turn into a dynasty, oh jerks like the yankees. Yeah, I know
[02:20:03.720 --> 02:20:06.600]  They're they're they're supposed to be a lovable loser franchise
[02:20:06.600 --> 02:20:11.080]  I think I think we'll go another hundred years now. I really think that uh, that's possible
[02:20:11.080 --> 02:20:14.840]  I don't know. Look at the socks the socks, you know broke a long streak and then they they
[02:20:15.480 --> 02:20:21.480]  I guess the socks have won more world series who can stand them who can nobody they're the worst. Nobody. Yeah, they're the worst
[02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:29.080]  All right. Thank you. Dan from everybody can check you out on twitter at from dome. It's a great twitter account and uh,
[02:20:29.960 --> 02:20:32.840]  They could see your work and the work of your fine staff at uh
[02:20:32.840 --> 02:20:39.800]  At recode.net recode.net. Remember you used to have beef with recode. That was hilarious. That was way before I got there
[02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:41.720]  What was my beef with recode now?
[02:20:41.720 --> 02:20:48.200]  Remember there were some issues where they wouldn't call they didn't uh, I mean first the the the slash in the name
[02:20:48.200 --> 02:20:50.920]  Which I got rid of but the uh, there was something where?
[02:20:52.440 --> 02:20:54.440]  I think one of my former colleagues was
[02:20:55.000 --> 02:21:01.080]  Not citing you properly and so what was it was a phase where you would just call it recode. I think something like that
[02:21:01.080 --> 02:21:04.200]  is where you would just call it recode. I think some website or something like that
[02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:08.520]  Right it was
[02:21:08.920 --> 02:21:15.320]  It's like three years ago we're we're bringing back three-year-old twitter beef or uh blog beef. All right. Anyways
[02:21:16.920 --> 02:21:23.240]  Recode.net it was instead of referring to daring fireball. It was like a uh, a mac website
[02:21:24.200 --> 02:21:27.560]  Mac fan blog something like that. And so yeah
[02:21:27.560 --> 02:21:32.840]  Yeah, yeah if I spent I spent a couple of months I haven't had a beef in a while that was fun
[02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:58.360]  And I just called them. I just called them some website
