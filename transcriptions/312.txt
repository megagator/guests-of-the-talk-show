[00:00.000 --> 00:07.280]  Craig Maud, welcome to the talk show for the first time, right? Please tell me I'm not forgetting.
[00:08.800 --> 00:15.920]  Definitely the first time. 300 and some episodes in, I'd start to worry.
[00:15.920 --> 00:19.280]  It's crazy, man. I can't believe you've done 311 of these things.
[00:20.320 --> 00:21.360]  Especially at my pace.
[00:24.720 --> 00:27.440]  Well, you know, 30 years of podcasting, you'll get there.
[00:27.440 --> 00:37.440]  You and I have been pals for a long time. I suspect that more than usual on my show,
[00:37.440 --> 00:43.200]  there might be a fair number of listeners who are not familiar with you, or maybe only tangentially
[00:43.200 --> 00:49.520]  so. I mean, I certainly linked you on Daring Fireball semi-frequently, but you're not part
[00:49.520 --> 00:57.760]  of the regular Mac punditry crowd. So tell everybody about yourself a little.
[00:57.760 --> 01:01.840]  I never know. I always just tell people I'm a writer to simplify.
[01:01.840 --> 01:05.760]  I like that. I like that answer too. I actually don't know where you were
[01:06.640 --> 01:09.360]  raised. Somewhere in America, right?
[01:10.160 --> 01:12.640]  Yeah, over near Hartford, Connecticut.
[01:13.440 --> 01:17.760]  But you've lived in Japan now for 20 years?
[01:17.760 --> 01:20.720]  Yeah, we're on year 21 right now.
[01:20.720 --> 01:22.800]  So you went there for university, stayed.
[01:25.840 --> 01:36.400]  And you now run Special Projects, which is such a good name, but also such a terrible name.
[01:37.680 --> 01:42.160]  Right? I love it. I am so happy with that name.
[01:42.160 --> 01:49.600]  It's one of my favorite name things ever. I'm so glad because it was called something else before.
[01:50.160 --> 01:55.200]  It was called the Explorers Club, and I never liked that name. I don't know what it was about
[01:55.200 --> 02:00.480]  that name that never resonated for me. It was driving me crazy. Every time I had to write it,
[02:00.480 --> 02:08.160]  I wanted to stop doing it. Explorers Club, and it just didn't work. There's something about it
[02:08.160 --> 02:13.280]  that was off. So I switched to the Special Projects last summer, and a bunch of Explorers
[02:13.280 --> 02:18.800]  Club people freaked out. They went nuts about it. Oh, that was my favorite part of everything.
[02:19.680 --> 02:23.440]  And I love it. I have zero regrets.
[02:23.440 --> 02:31.360]  I don't even know, but if you search the web for just plain Special Projects, does it come up?
[02:31.360 --> 02:34.160]  I've never even tried.
[02:34.160 --> 02:38.640]  I've never even tried. But isn't that interesting that you've built a little business for yourself
[02:38.640 --> 02:43.120]  where that doesn't matter, right? I mean, that is not why I picked the name Daring Fireball,
[02:43.120 --> 02:47.520]  but it is, in fact, a very easily, you know, there's only one Daring Fireball.
[02:48.960 --> 02:54.400]  You know, Special Projects is your membership site, but you know what? This is hard to explain,
[02:54.400 --> 03:08.000]  but it is complicated, weirdly. Members can sign up. This is where it's a little confusing. You
[03:08.000 --> 03:15.440]  offer multiple newsletters. So compare and contrast with, say, Stratechery or our other mutual friend,
[03:15.440 --> 03:23.600]  Dan Frommer's New Consumer, where there's one membership tier and you get the main
[03:23.600 --> 03:33.360]  newsletter. Now, you have three newsletters. You have a website. You make books, and making books
[03:33.360 --> 03:37.360]  is probably the best verb I can say. I'm not trying to diminish you as a writer,
[03:37.360 --> 03:45.120]  but you also photograph them. You design them. You oversee the production of them.
[03:45.120 --> 03:57.360]  Now, you're making short movies. But the basic dynamics of the arrangement are people can pay
[03:57.360 --> 04:08.160]  $10 a month or $100 a year to become members. That is the revenue that supports your career,
[04:08.160 --> 04:16.160]  and you get to spend your time writing, photographing, making videos, doing these
[04:16.160 --> 04:20.960]  things that you're driven to do. Is that a fair description?
[04:20.960 --> 04:26.000]  Yeah, yeah. I'd say it's pretty good. If I was going to summarize it, maybe
[04:27.280 --> 04:34.000]  make it a little simpler, I produce a bunch of stuff, like cultural output. One of the reasons
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.400]  one of the reasons why it's so difficult to frame my membership program in terms of what the clear
[04:40.400 --> 04:48.640]  value proposition is, is that I'm not selling, for example, background information on business.
[04:48.640 --> 04:54.240]  I'm not writing about finance. I'm not doing self-help stuff. I'm not going to give you tips
[04:54.240 --> 05:00.720]  to be a better person or whatever necessarily. But I'm just producing all of this content. Most
[05:00.720 --> 05:08.080]  of it is for free under this umbrella of culture, cultural production, or for lack of a better
[05:08.080 --> 05:15.840]  phrase. So the membership program is basically like NPR for me. So if you're a fan of the stuff
[05:15.840 --> 05:21.600]  that I've been making, which 95% of it is available for free, and you want to just support
[05:21.600 --> 05:28.400]  the production of that, that's what the membership program is. And then I've just added lots of small
[05:28.400 --> 05:33.280]  value adds for members, because what I found is that a membership program is one of the amazing
[05:34.240 --> 05:42.560]  bonuses of it. It's not just the revenue, but you develop this essentially gang of super fans
[05:42.560 --> 05:48.080]  that are amazing to bounce ideas off of. So I started doing, because of the pandemic,
[05:48.800 --> 05:55.200]  a bunch of members only live streams of me just doing super boring work, just like the most
[05:55.200 --> 06:03.280]  boring work you can imagine. So I did 10 hours of live streaming, building this website last March,
[06:03.920 --> 06:10.320]  and there'd be like 20, 30, 50 people on the live stream at any moment, all just members.
[06:10.320 --> 06:16.960]  So always really intimate, but what it allowed me to do that I didn't expect to happen was this
[06:16.960 --> 06:23.920]  kind of running articulation of what it means to do this kind of work. So to just sort of
[06:23.920 --> 06:30.160]  pull back, open the doors to, hey, this is actually, you see the end product, which is
[06:30.160 --> 06:37.040]  either this finished website or this finished book, but this is the 10, 20, 30 hours of what
[06:37.040 --> 06:41.920]  I'm actually doing to produce this thing. When you're doing the live stream, you can live
[06:41.920 --> 06:46.080]  narrate it a little bit, take questions, people are like, oh, why are you doing that now? What's
[06:46.080 --> 06:50.160]  that tool you're using? What's that app you're using? And you just kind of share things. I've
[06:50.160 --> 06:57.120]  just found that to be really, really enriching and wonderful. And this kind of weird bonus of
[06:57.120 --> 07:02.800]  the membership program that when I started it, I never thought would be part of it. These are
[07:02.800 --> 07:08.800]  things that I wouldn't want to do out into the, you know, just to the general, to a general
[07:08.800 --> 07:15.440]  audience, because there is something like so intimate about showing how you produce, say,
[07:15.440 --> 07:20.240]  design a book or how you're, you know, building this website, you know, I'm in a sublime text,
[07:20.240 --> 07:24.640]  I'm writing, I'm like, you know, I'm writing, I'm editing live, essentially, on these live
[07:24.640 --> 07:28.880]  streams. And to do that in front of say, if I opened it up to everyone who's following me,
[07:28.880 --> 07:32.800]  you know, say it'd be 1000 people or whatever, like, that's a very different performative
[07:32.800 --> 07:38.160]  experience than in front of 30 super fans that, you know, are going to support you and are going
[07:38.160 --> 07:45.440]  to, I don't know, just be positive in general, like there's no posturing. So that like, it's just
[07:45.440 --> 07:53.280]  been incredible to have this like tool, basically a creative tool to motivate me to be better and be
[07:53.280 --> 07:58.880]  more self aware of why I use the software I use, and like why I make the decisions around the
[07:58.880 --> 08:03.920]  creative projects that I do. And that's been that's been fantastic. That's been a really,
[08:03.920 --> 08:11.120]  really wonderful benefit. You're now starting year three. Yeah, we're in year three of the membership,
[08:11.120 --> 08:17.680]  right? Effectively, I think you started in February 2019. But you know, February is early
[08:17.680 --> 08:22.880]  enough in a year where we could you could just say it. 2019 was the first year. 2020 was the second
[08:22.880 --> 08:31.040]  year. And now 2021. Yeah. And you've written copiously about your experiences. And to me,
[08:31.040 --> 08:35.840]  Dan Frommer has done the same thing and talking at a at a sort of meta level about, you know,
[08:36.400 --> 08:43.760]  what's worked, what hasn't worked and and building this and it's like your timing was
[08:45.360 --> 08:49.120]  serendipitous, right? Because you're you're you're ahead way out, you're like two years
[08:49.120 --> 08:55.360]  ahead of the substack phenomenon. But you know, I mean, so you can you can you can you're not like
[08:55.360 --> 09:02.320]  a Johnny come lately to the I'm going to run my independent publishing creative output work as a
[09:02.320 --> 09:07.760]  membership system. Basically, memberships are having a moment right now. Yeah, well,
[09:07.760 --> 09:14.000]  yeah, because I think a little bit of the what we've done is we've normalized over the last
[09:14.000 --> 09:17.440]  decade, really, in the last five years, we've normalized this idea of like,
[09:18.480 --> 09:23.760]  paying for stuff is a good thing to do. You know, it's like if you if you have things,
[09:23.760 --> 09:28.960]  institutions that you love, institutions that you want to see continue in the world,
[09:28.960 --> 09:35.280]  then it turns out that paying for them is, is, is positive, that's a positive signal and, you know,
[09:35.280 --> 09:40.880]  makes things sustainable. And so I think that's kind of tipped over into, you know, the independent
[09:40.880 --> 09:45.920]  creative world as well. And the tools have just gotten better. But you've built a lot of your
[09:45.920 --> 09:51.760]  system yourself, or at least you're taking some pre built pieces like a campaign monitor you use
[09:51.760 --> 09:57.040]  for sending out the actual newsletters, and snapping that into a system with, you know,
[09:57.600 --> 10:01.920]  what do you stripe for payments or no memberful, right? But memberful is sort of a thing that's
[10:01.920 --> 10:09.920]  built on stripe. Yep. It I don't think it's complicated, but you've explained it in great
[10:09.920 --> 10:16.400]  detail. But it is it is interesting, though, to me, like all of these things didn't really exist
[10:16.400 --> 10:22.240]  15 years ago, right? There was no stripe of 15 years ago. I mean, there was, you know, PayPal was
[10:22.240 --> 10:29.440]  probably the stripe of 1520 years ago, and you just couldn't use PayPal quite as snap together
[10:29.440 --> 10:35.360]  seamlessly the way that you can use stripe today. Right? Well, I mean, I think stripes masterstroke,
[10:35.360 --> 10:40.720]  and obviously, Patrick and, and john knew this when they built it by is the API, you know, it's
[10:40.720 --> 10:46.960]  just they, they, it was never this, this consumer facing thing. As a consumer, you never went to
[10:46.960 --> 10:53.120]  stripe.com. You still for the most part, I don't think go to stripe.com. And I think that, you know,
[10:53.120 --> 10:56.240]  in a lot of ways, this was the Twitter ecosystem in the beginning as well, where it was like,
[10:56.240 --> 11:01.520]  Oh, hey, look, yeah, there's a Twitter client, but there, here's this API, and you can build amazing
[11:01.520 --> 11:06.400]  software on top of this incredible stream of, you know, sort of consciousness that's coming out of,
[11:06.400 --> 11:14.400]  you know, everyone on the timeline, and look at the vibrant ecosystem that can be built from that.
[11:14.400 --> 11:20.160]  Now, Twitter, obviously, pulled back from that, that mode of thinking, but I think stripe is such
[11:20.160 --> 11:28.080]  a wonderful example of building a perfect bit of infrastructure and, you know, creating the right
[11:28.080 --> 11:34.560]  endpoints that anyone can plug into however they want to. And you do see things like Shopify. So
[11:34.560 --> 11:39.120]  Shopify doesn't use stripe. You know, they've built Shopify payments, I think in the case of
[11:40.240 --> 11:44.640]  company's largest Shopify, which is fascinating, actually, Shopify is like one of my most
[11:44.640 --> 11:49.040]  absolutely most, most fascinating companies, I think, out there today. The fact that they're,
[11:49.840 --> 11:53.360]  they're basically the only real Amazon competitor at this point, I think is,
[11:53.360 --> 11:57.920]  is incredible. And the software is amazing. I don't know if you've used Shopify, or if you've
[11:57.920 --> 12:03.600]  built on anything, anything on Shopify, but it's pretty great. I mean, it's not perfect, but it is,
[12:03.600 --> 12:11.760]  you know, if you compare AWS and Shopify, it's like, one is very user friendly. But, but for
[12:11.760 --> 12:16.000]  the most part, you know, like Memberful uses stripe, Patreon probably uses stripe as the
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.840]  back end, a lot of these, you know, Ghost uses stripe as the back end. And what's interesting
[12:19.840 --> 12:25.520]  about stripe, if it's used as the membership back end for payments is that it's portable,
[12:25.520 --> 12:30.080]  you can like you can essentially move that's the all those stripe tokens to whatever next platform
[12:30.080 --> 12:35.520]  you want to use. So you're not, if essentially you're not locked in, I'm not locked into
[12:35.520 --> 12:39.680]  Memberful, I can move to a different platform if I wanted to, which is really powerful.
[12:40.880 --> 12:44.240]  Yeah, and that's certainly one of the more compelling things about Substack's message,
[12:44.240 --> 12:50.320]  too, is that, you know, they let the creators, the authors who were writing on Substack know
[12:50.320 --> 12:54.000]  that if you ever want to leave, you can you get to take your mailing list with you.
[12:54.640 --> 12:56.480]  Yeah, I wonder how long that's gonna last, though.
[12:56.480 --> 13:02.080]  I don't know, either, because the valuations are so, you know, the numbers they're talking
[13:02.080 --> 13:08.400]  about are so crazy. And it's like, I think it's a good business in terms of like a traditional
[13:08.400 --> 13:13.760]  business. And, you know, like, like the type of thing you and I run, where it's like, if your
[13:13.760 --> 13:19.840]  monthly income is higher than your monthly expenses, then that's pretty good, you know,
[13:19.840 --> 13:26.160]  as opposed to, you know, raising a bunch of venture capital and just having this fountain
[13:26.160 --> 13:30.160]  of money and just throwing it at it until all of a sudden it goes away, you know?
[13:30.880 --> 13:38.320]  I think it's gonna be interesting. It's gonna be interesting to watch what Substack does. I mean,
[13:38.320 --> 13:43.600]  $65 million is a lot of dollars, you know, and I think...
[13:43.600 --> 13:46.240]  It's a lot of $10 monthly newsletters.
[13:46.240 --> 13:50.960]  monthly newsletters. It's so many. But so...
[13:50.960 --> 13:56.160]  For a platform that allows the creators to move whenever they want. And the bigger you get,
[13:56.160 --> 14:00.640]  the more motivated, you know, they take, I think their split is like 90-10. And I don't know if
[14:00.640 --> 14:10.000]  that includes the Stripe payment. So it might be more like, you know, 87-13, if you include Stripe.
[14:10.000 --> 14:17.280]  You know, once you get to a, you know, into that thousand true, true belief,
[14:17.280 --> 14:19.520]  what's the Kevin Kelly's term, the thousand true fans?
[14:19.520 --> 14:20.560]  Thousand true fans, yep.
[14:20.560 --> 14:25.280]  You know, but that's, that is the basic model. And that has been the dream. You know, this,
[14:25.280 --> 14:31.200]  Kevin Kelly was the founding editor of Wired magazine, you know, long, long standing career,
[14:31.200 --> 14:38.080]  but he had this theory that, you know, on the internet allows an artist to make a good living
[14:38.080 --> 14:46.480]  with 1000 true fans who are maybe paying $10 a month or $100 a year, or maybe just buy their
[14:46.480 --> 14:50.800]  album when it comes out. I don't know, I guess people don't really buy albums anymore. But,
[14:50.800 --> 14:57.600]  you know, you get the feeling that 1000 fans can support an artist very well. And in a way
[14:57.600 --> 15:02.640]  that never was possible pre internet, there was just no way you couldn't do what you do.
[15:02.640 --> 15:08.240]  I couldn't do what I do. Right. I mean, what would the pre internet equivalent of what you're
[15:08.240 --> 15:14.880]  doing be? I mean, there's, it would be, it would probably be running like an indie press, you know,
[15:14.880 --> 15:19.840]  and really cobbling together. It's interesting, though, because like, in other countries,
[15:19.840 --> 15:24.240]  I think, like Americans have this impoverished view of like, what's possible as an independent
[15:24.240 --> 15:29.120]  artist, because there's like, there's just so few subsidies for artists in America,
[15:29.120 --> 15:33.040]  relative to other countries. Like if you, if you talk to like a Canadian poet,
[15:33.600 --> 15:37.200]  you know, and you're like, Oh, it must be so tough being a poet and get, you know,
[15:37.200 --> 15:41.760]  and they're like, What are you talking about, man? We've got all these like, poet, you know,
[15:41.760 --> 15:46.560]  funds and grants and stuff up here in Canada. You know, if you put together your first chapbook,
[15:46.560 --> 15:52.080]  or whatever, you get $50,000. Like there's, there's just wild amounts of opportunity for
[15:52.080 --> 15:59.440]  artists in, I feel like in countries like, like Canada, and in Europe, all over Europe, just the,
[16:00.080 --> 16:05.600]  the the network of sort of artists residencies and stuff. And I think that's kind of always been
[16:05.600 --> 16:10.960]  the case. I don't think this is a relatively new thing. And so, yeah, I think probably the
[16:10.960 --> 16:16.320]  equivalent 20 or 30 years ago would be, you know, being like a Canadian, you know, like in Vancouver
[16:16.320 --> 16:22.080]  running a small independent, you know, publishing company, and being really excited selling like
[16:22.080 --> 16:32.560]  300 or 400 books a year. But it would be hard to get word out, right? And it's like, I'm so
[16:33.280 --> 16:38.480]  American, and my view is so warped by having grown up in the decades I did.
[16:38.480 --> 16:46.560]  Not to get zealotrous about it, but it's clear to me now, in middle age, and and having a better
[16:46.560 --> 17:00.480]  sense of the last, the decades of my adult life, that America took a profoundly capitalist turn
[17:00.480 --> 17:09.680]  in the 70s and 80s. And, and as shaped things like that, like, I don't think it's weird that
[17:09.680 --> 17:15.680]  Canada has, you know, government sponsored fellowships and, and things like that for poetry.
[17:16.320 --> 17:22.640]  And, and there are ways to to get similar things from universities here in the United States,
[17:22.640 --> 17:26.880]  but it does seem sound weird to American ears that the government might just
[17:26.880 --> 17:33.600]  provide stipends to artists to have a, not just like a, a substance level, but to actually,
[17:33.600 --> 17:40.080]  you know, have a nice life. Yeah. And that it's good, you know, and, and that it's just accepted
[17:40.080 --> 17:44.800]  across society that this is actually good for the country to be producing this. I just saw a quote
[17:44.800 --> 17:53.600]  from JFK talking about the arts, and it was the thing that made me, you know, think about it,
[17:53.600 --> 17:59.040]  and it was the thing that made me realize, it's just one of those things, you know, like, when,
[17:59.040 --> 18:05.200]  when, knowing that you were going to be on the show, I just started catching, you know, certain
[18:05.200 --> 18:12.160]  Craig Motti type things, just, you know, no, but, but it's what gave me this thought about, like,
[18:12.800 --> 18:19.600]  the turn that Reaganism had away from that Kennedy idea, you know, the Kennedy Center for the Arts
[18:19.600 --> 18:25.600]  is still a big thing. But it was this quote from when he was president talking about how he looks
[18:25.600 --> 18:32.320]  forward to a day in America where we do just as much to support artists, society-wise, as we do
[18:32.320 --> 18:39.600]  scientists and teachers and stuff like that, and that it's good for the fabric of society to do
[18:39.600 --> 18:46.480]  that. And that just isn't a message we heard in the 80s or the 90s. And it's not even a partisan
[18:46.480 --> 18:50.800]  thing. It's just, you know, because, you know, we had Reagan, and then we had Clinton. So it's not
[18:50.800 --> 18:58.560]  like, oh, just the Republicans or Democrats, but it just wasn't the direction that things went.
[18:59.280 --> 19:03.280]  Yeah, well, which is weird, because America does have an amazing network of
[19:03.280 --> 19:08.320]  artist residencies, just they're not, they're all privately funded. A lot of them, you know,
[19:09.040 --> 19:12.960]  probably, you know, arguably one of the best, you know, one of the oldest and best writing
[19:12.960 --> 19:20.480]  residencies in the world is up in New Hampshire called McDowell. And I went there nine years ago,
[19:20.480 --> 19:26.800]  and it was life changing. It really was. It was truly this life changing experience of that. I
[19:26.800 --> 19:35.360]  think what's difficult about people being convinced that art is important in the world
[19:35.360 --> 19:43.040]  is I think folks have this false image of the artist as this, you know, hippie smoking Mary
[19:43.040 --> 19:48.160]  Jane and just like faffing around, right? That's sort of this, like, ridiculous image that I think
[19:48.160 --> 19:55.360]  a lot of people carry around of artists. But if you actually engage with serious committed artists,
[19:55.360 --> 20:00.000]  it's like, you know, I've done projects at CERN, and I've been to like residencies like this thing
[20:00.000 --> 20:07.280]  at McDowell. And I would put both of those activities, so the physics research at CERN and
[20:07.280 --> 20:13.680]  the artistic rigor and work and commitment at an institution like McDowell as operating at a very
[20:13.680 --> 20:17.680]  similar level. It's like, it's very, it's one of those things that like, it doesn't make any sense
[20:17.680 --> 20:22.080]  to you until you go and you live in there. I've spent three weeks at CERN, I've spent a month at
[20:22.080 --> 20:28.000]  McDowell. And you go and you live with these people, and you kind of participate in their
[20:28.000 --> 20:33.840]  universe. And you just kind of breathe it in. And you realize that that rigor of curiosity
[20:33.840 --> 20:41.680]  and investigation is, there's a parody there between scientific exploration and artistic
[20:41.680 --> 20:47.440]  exploration, like absolutely undeniably. And it's really exciting. But it's also hard to convince
[20:47.440 --> 20:53.040]  people that sometimes, you know, it's like, it's like, oh, you just threw some paint on a, you know,
[20:53.040 --> 20:57.440]  on a canvas and, you know, and then rubbed your naked body over it or something like that. What
[20:57.440 --> 21:06.480]  are you doing? But often there's a tremendous amount of incredible, incredible, again, rigor of
[21:06.480 --> 21:10.960]  exploration happening behind so much art, you know, and in literature, it's maybe a little
[21:10.960 --> 21:15.280]  easier to see like folks like James Baldwin, you know, and how his work and his essays are
[21:15.280 --> 21:19.120]  resonating. You know, they've had this resurgence in the last decade because of what's been
[21:19.120 --> 21:24.080]  happening in the world. And, you know, that's, that's so powerful, you know, and hit that work
[21:24.080 --> 21:29.200]  was empowered by a lot of, a lot of grants and residency work, and a lot of it happened in
[21:29.200 --> 21:36.880]  Europe. So I think it's really a shame that, that the arts sort of get thrown under the bus so
[21:36.880 --> 21:42.800]  quickly, when it comes to budgets and whatnot. Yeah, it is one of these things where I think, if
[21:42.800 --> 21:49.200]  you did the math on it, that the returns of money invested in the arts, in terms of, I don't know,
[21:49.200 --> 21:55.200]  GDP, and some say, if you could really trace it all, you'd see a seriously positive return, like
[21:55.200 --> 22:00.880]  a good multiple on those investments, you know, and, and yet it's, it's different. It's one of
[22:00.880 --> 22:05.520]  these difficult, conceptually difficult things for people to grasp. And certainly people in
[22:05.520 --> 22:09.760]  government, it seems they, you know, they're like, we don't need the painting program. We don't
[22:09.760 --> 22:17.760]  need the music program. Yeah. If you can't, if you can't prove it in a spreadsheet, it's, it's the,
[22:17.760 --> 22:24.080]  it has no value. It is the mindset, you know. Which is such a problem these days, because the
[22:24.080 --> 22:29.840]  world is, is getting to this level of complexity where these like one-to-one direct relationships
[22:29.840 --> 22:38.640]  between action and output are becoming so abstract that you need to, you need to develop this,
[22:38.640 --> 22:45.360]  this rigor of, of, of investigation, you know, that I think a lot of people don't have where
[22:45.360 --> 22:49.600]  it's like, oh, you know, why is this happening in the world right now? And instead of just,
[22:49.600 --> 22:53.120]  you know, this is why conspiracy theories are so seductive is because they reduce
[22:53.680 --> 23:01.600]  the complexity of the fact that the world is this crazy spider web of things. And if you
[23:01.600 --> 23:06.160]  pluck a string over here, it's going to resonate in weird ways on the other side of the world. And,
[23:06.160 --> 23:12.480]  and to follow those, those threads out requires commitment and it requires an intellectual
[23:12.480 --> 23:18.960]  curiosity that, you know, is often lost on YouTube or, you know, on, in, in a Twitter stream or
[23:18.960 --> 23:24.240]  something like that. So it's, it's anyway, it's a weird moment, but to bring it back to like these
[23:24.240 --> 23:29.520]  membership programs that we have, it is incredibly empowering right now to, I think, if you are a
[23:29.520 --> 23:34.800]  self-motivated creative person, like all the tools are there, all the tools are there. And,
[23:34.800 --> 23:39.920]  the people, the fans, the folks who want to support your work, they know how to do it.
[23:39.920 --> 23:44.960]  Like, we've all kind of, we figured it out. And that's, that's exciting. I mean, what do you
[23:44.960 --> 23:50.560]  think was the start of this really, this kind of, this current push? Would you say like Kickstarter
[23:50.560 --> 23:54.560]  a decade ago was really the thing that kind of, that kind of like activated this world?
[23:55.680 --> 24:02.160]  Yeah, I think so. Maybe. It's, it's hard to say. Kickstarter was certainly super influential
[24:02.160 --> 24:09.040]  because it certainly, I, and I, I've always thought, and again, there's all sorts of
[24:09.040 --> 24:13.200]  Kickstarters that I've supported over the years. And some of them are just purely digital to buy,
[24:13.200 --> 24:17.520]  you know, somebody's ebook or, or something like that. But for the most part, most of the
[24:17.520 --> 24:23.200]  Kickstarters I've had an interest in were to produce physical items. You know, like, but one
[24:23.200 --> 24:28.240]  of my favorites is the Studio Neat Guys who make all sorts of great products. I think maybe their
[24:28.240 --> 24:32.480]  great products. I think maybe their first was the Glyph. It was like a, you know, the first
[24:35.120 --> 24:41.760]  tripod mounts for the, for the iPhone. But just to make things, right. And to get, you know,
[24:41.760 --> 24:47.520]  but to actually make a physical item, you need capital, right? Like that, like the advantage
[24:47.520 --> 24:54.400]  to doing something purely digital, like my website, Daring Fireball, is I could bootstrap it with
[24:54.400 --> 25:00.560]  almost no money at all. I mean, it was ridiculous. When I got started the first, I think at least
[25:01.520 --> 25:07.840]  two years of Daring Fireball, I was on like a $12 a month shared hosting account. And it,
[25:07.840 --> 25:12.320]  you know, it was great. It was probably more than I needed. I probably could have like downgraded
[25:12.320 --> 25:20.320]  to the $8 one. That, that's phenomenal. But, and for me personally, it was always,
[25:20.320 --> 25:26.480]  oh, I sympathize with you when you, when you launched your project and you said like,
[25:26.480 --> 25:30.480]  you dreaded it and you didn't want to ask. I mean, cause I did memberships back in the day.
[25:31.040 --> 25:35.760]  Yeah. I was going to ask you about that. Cause I remember I was, I I'm pretty sure I was a member
[25:35.760 --> 25:41.200]  because I wanted that full RSS feed. That was the perk, right? Right. I've told this story
[25:41.200 --> 25:50.640]  numerous times, but I'll tell, I'll try to tell it again. But the basic idea was I, 2004 was when I
[25:50.640 --> 25:57.920]  started selling t-shirts and memberships in 2006 is when I quit my job at Joanne and went full
[25:57.920 --> 26:05.920]  time thinking I needed to go full time to have the, you know, the, the, the, the chicken and the
[26:05.920 --> 26:11.760]  egg problem was that you need to go full time first to produce the work. And then the audience
[26:11.760 --> 26:17.680]  will grow. And that if I waited, if I kept waiting forever with Daring Fireball as a side project,
[26:17.680 --> 26:25.440]  I wasn't going to get there. What am I waiting for? And the fear of failure was mortifying
[26:25.440 --> 26:32.640]  absolutely enough to completely seize me up. But on the other hand, I, I don't know who told me,
[26:32.640 --> 26:37.760]  I, you know, I, but somebody effectively said, what is the worst that could possibly happen?
[26:37.760 --> 26:42.400]  It's probably my wife, but, uh, that it, if it doesn't work out financially,
[26:43.360 --> 26:49.120]  you lose nothing. Right. Like, you know, and, and if anything, if I just spend, you know, a year
[26:49.840 --> 26:55.680]  and a bunch of savings doing even more writing than ever before and become better known,
[26:56.400 --> 27:01.280]  if I do need to, did need to get a job somewhere else, I'd be better known than I was before.
[27:01.280 --> 27:07.120]  All right. Um, but anyway, my membership system, my idea was,
[27:08.800 --> 27:13.280]  so anybody who bought a t-shirt got a membership and if you didn't want a t-shirt, you could just
[27:13.280 --> 27:21.440]  pay $19 a year and become a member and the exclusive perk. Cause I did have the idea
[27:21.440 --> 27:26.720]  even back then, there had to be something, right. There's gotta be, even if you think,
[27:26.720 --> 27:31.600]  and most of the people say, I just love daring fireball. I would love to just support you.
[27:31.600 --> 27:35.600]  I just want to give you the thing. What pushes them over the edge. You always mentioned that
[27:35.600 --> 27:40.960]  the NPR tote bags, nobody really gives a shit about the tote bags or the umbrellas, you know?
[27:42.160 --> 27:45.920]  But it pushes people over the edge. They're like, well, I might as well get it. Now I'll get the
[27:45.920 --> 27:50.960]  tote bag. I've been meaning to give money to NBR. You know, the umbrella looks nice. I'll get the
[27:50.960 --> 28:03.440]  umbrella. I don't really need a tote bag. Uh, our full content RSS feeds were, this sounds very old,
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.560]  although I guess it still is an issue. It seems like most of the RSS feeds I read now though,
[28:08.560 --> 28:14.720]  are all from independent blogs, right? Just people. And so of course they have the full
[28:14.720 --> 28:21.440]  content because they're, they're not trying to hoard it behind, you know, some kind of publications
[28:21.440 --> 28:27.680]  gateway. But it was a huge thing because everybody in the golden era, original golden era of RSS,
[28:28.880 --> 28:33.840]  the bigger publications, I'll just, I'll throw Ars Technica under the bus. Ars Technica
[28:33.840 --> 28:39.040]  had just had excerpts in their articles. And so you'd get the headline, you'd know there was,
[28:39.040 --> 28:43.200]  you'd know who wrote it. You'd get like the summary. And then if you wanted to read the
[28:43.200 --> 28:48.560]  full article, you had to double click or whatever the action was in your feed reader of choice to
[28:48.560 --> 28:56.000]  go to the Ars Technica website because the website is where they had the ads and the ads are how
[28:56.000 --> 29:00.320]  they made the money. So it wasn't like, you know, they were ripping anybody off and it was clear
[29:00.320 --> 29:05.520]  why they were doing it. The ads were only generating money on their website. So they
[29:05.520 --> 29:13.520]  couldn't, they felt like they couldn't give away the articles in the RSS. So I, I guess I forget
[29:13.520 --> 29:17.520]  if I only had excerpts, I forget what I had before, but I wanted to, I knew people wanted
[29:17.520 --> 29:24.320]  to read full articles in, from Daring Fireball in the RSS reader. And I wanted to make people happy,
[29:24.320 --> 29:30.800]  but I was already trying, you know, the nascent days of my sponsorship system were there too.
[29:30.800 --> 29:35.200]  And that's, so I had my ads on the website. And so I thought, well, I'll do this thing and you
[29:35.200 --> 29:40.320]  pay $19 and then you'll get your own little private URL and you can read the full content.
[29:40.320 --> 29:45.920]  And it did pretty well. I mean, it absolutely, the membership thing absolutely helped me in
[29:45.920 --> 29:50.480]  that first year when I went full time in 2006, I wouldn't have made it without it.
[29:52.400 --> 30:00.960]  My analogy was, it still is, is like early 2006, I went full time, made the big announcement,
[30:00.960 --> 30:07.200]  asked people for their support. And we had, I forget how many, tens of thousand dollars in
[30:07.200 --> 30:12.000]  savings that we had sort of, you know, okay, this is what we can live off while we try to get this
[30:12.000 --> 30:17.840]  thing into black. And it was like an airplane slowly approaching the ground, but then starting
[30:17.840 --> 30:22.400]  to pull up, you know, like by summer, it was like the monthly revenue was getting closer. It's like,
[30:22.960 --> 30:29.200]  but it's, it's gonna, this is gonna come really close to eating through all the savings
[30:29.200 --> 30:34.640]  until the point later in the year. But by the end of the year, it was break even month to month,
[30:34.640 --> 30:36.640]  which was pretty amazing.
[30:36.640 --> 30:44.720]  And was, was there any fear of, I guess, like reputational hits that you could take by doing this?
[30:46.560 --> 30:51.920]  I guess so, because, you know, I mean, my big fear would be that if it hadn't worked and I had
[30:51.920 --> 31:01.280]  to take a full time job somewhere, you know, that either A, the job would, by some aspect of it,
[31:02.400 --> 31:08.480]  require me to stop writing during Fireball, right? Like if I become a full time staff writer at
[31:08.480 --> 31:16.080]  Macworld or something like that, or in theory, there's some roll of the dice over the last 20
[31:16.080 --> 31:22.800]  years where I wind up working at Apple, right? I mean, that's, you know, it could have happened
[31:22.800 --> 31:29.280]  at some point and the earlier years were probably more likely. But obviously, you know, I don't know
[31:29.280 --> 31:33.440]  if you've ever noticed this, but most people who work at Apple don't write a personal blog,
[31:34.240 --> 31:41.200]  where they espouse strong opinions about Apple and its products and competitors, and etc.
[31:41.200 --> 31:46.160]  And would I have had to shudder during Fireball? I doubt it. But I mean, you know,
[31:46.160 --> 31:51.680]  some kind of announcement like, hey, I've taken a job at Apple, and we're moving to Cupertino,
[31:51.680 --> 31:56.240]  and you know, blah, blah, blah, would have would have disappointed me greatly.
[31:56.240 --> 31:59.600]  Yeah. Well, you go ahead, right? I mean, that's kind of what's,
[31:59.600 --> 32:02.240]  that's the biggest thing that's at stake in a lot of these cases.
[32:02.240 --> 32:06.960]  Well, and the other thing to me is that I just have, I've never had, I've never been
[32:06.960 --> 32:11.680]  successful working for somebody else. I forget the longest I've ever had a job.
[32:12.880 --> 32:18.400]  But it's not much more than two years. And that's at anything. And it's because
[32:19.520 --> 32:25.760]  I, I'm a friendly fellow. And I think I get, you know, it's not like I'm irascible.
[32:25.760 --> 32:31.360]  And I'm not listening. It's just though, eventually, this is what I need to be doing.
[32:31.360 --> 32:36.000]  And I'm going to spend my time on, you know, time I should be spending on work, I would be spending
[32:36.000 --> 32:39.680]  writing stuff for Daring Fireball, because I just feel compelled to do it. And so I,
[32:39.680 --> 32:43.600]  what I desperately needed to do is figure out a way to make that work financially.
[32:44.240 --> 32:49.680]  Right. Well, it was always my, I'm right there with you. My, you know, my whole thing was always
[32:49.680 --> 32:54.480]  when I run out of independent stuff that I absolutely need to do, then I'll,
[32:54.480 --> 33:02.960]  I'll go think about getting a job. That was, that was, and, and it's not like I had a trust fund.
[33:02.960 --> 33:09.040]  I, you know, I, I came from this little airplane engine factory town where I'm one of like 10
[33:09.040 --> 33:15.120]  people who made it out of the out of that town from a high school class. And it was more just,
[33:15.120 --> 33:21.440]  you know, living in Japan is such a huge life hack. I think that that people have this
[33:21.440 --> 33:28.160]  misconstrued sense of the cost of living in Japan, actually living in Tokyo, in my 20s was the only
[33:28.160 --> 33:33.920]  way I was able to do all the work I did and make as little money as I did. I was, you know, in my,
[33:33.920 --> 33:40.320]  for most of my 20s, I was making about $20,000 a year max, like cobbling that together through
[33:41.200 --> 33:47.920]  certain projects and whatever. And my whole thing was like, as soon as I ran out of, I need to make
[33:47.920 --> 33:54.080]  this, I need to make this, I need to make this, then I'll go find a job somewhere else. But that
[33:54.080 --> 34:00.080]  impulse to, to work on these other projects was so overwhelming and all consuming that
[34:01.280 --> 34:04.480]  the, you know, there's that Steve Jobs quote of like, you know, do you wake up in the morning
[34:04.480 --> 34:08.800]  and like, is, you know, are you doing the thing you want to do that day? You know, every day you
[34:08.800 --> 34:13.200]  ask, is this what I want to be doing? Is this what I want? And I just, every day I woke up and I had
[34:13.200 --> 34:21.200]  a thing that I must do. And that was, you know, I, I tried to basically protect the time around
[34:21.200 --> 34:26.880]  that by minimizing my cost of living. You know, for most of my 20s, my, my yearly, this is going
[34:26.880 --> 34:33.200]  to sound insane, but my yearly like base cost of living was about $10,000. That was, that was
[34:33.200 --> 34:38.880]  living in Tokyo. Right? I didn't know that the economics work like that in Tokyo. If I had 10,000,
[34:38.880 --> 34:44.240]  if I had $10,000 coming in for the year, I would not, I could have a roof over my head and I could
[34:44.240 --> 34:49.440]  be eating decently well. And I could be, you know, working on all the projects that I wanted
[34:49.440 --> 34:53.920]  to work on because like, you know, like you said, a lot of web stuff, there's no, there's no cost to
[34:53.920 --> 34:59.360]  it. You know, the servers were, were relatively cheap. I did have a racks based server at one
[34:59.360 --> 35:08.000]  point, which was my biggest cost by far in my life. Absolutely. And like 50 bucks a month.
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.960]  Yeah, it was, yeah, it was, but it was, you know, that was, I needed that to do certain,
[35:12.960 --> 35:17.360]  certain programming things and have tasks processing data in the background and blah,
[35:17.360 --> 35:23.920]  blah, blah. And, you know, that was, that was, that was my big expense. But, you know, for the
[35:23.920 --> 35:30.480]  most part, you could do this online work in this kind of miraculous way where if you had a computer
[35:30.480 --> 35:35.120]  and a fast internet connection and in Japan, we have, I've had fiber in Japan for the last 18
[35:35.120 --> 35:41.600]  years, you know, and it's like 30 bucks a month. It's like, it's pretty, that was always just
[35:41.600 --> 35:47.600]  there. You know, you can kind of build as an, as an individual creator, I'd say the last 20
[35:47.600 --> 35:51.840]  years have probably been one of the most miraculous, incredible moments in history
[35:51.840 --> 35:57.040]  in terms of what one person can do and the, and the amount of exposure they can get for their
[35:57.040 --> 36:03.760]  work. It's just, it's, it's astounding to think back on it. Well, I, I've, I was thinking about
[36:03.760 --> 36:09.120]  that rereading your essays on, on the system you've built for running special projects and
[36:09.120 --> 36:17.920]  how it is, it's, it's a longer list of components than, okay, get a shared hosting account and
[36:17.920 --> 36:23.920]  install movable type or WordPress, or remember gray matter, you know, find a blogging package,
[36:24.640 --> 36:33.040]  unzip it, type something into a config file, and then you just start banging away on CSS and HTML
[36:33.040 --> 36:40.880]  templates. And you're, that's it. There's more components, but it's also very clearly something,
[36:42.080 --> 36:48.080]  you know, you, I, you and I are similar in a way that we're technically adept enough that we can
[36:48.080 --> 36:53.200]  do a lot of this on our own. You know, like I'm, I'm much more of a writer than anything else,
[36:53.200 --> 36:57.840]  but I have a computer science degree and that was, that was a huge, huge boon. And, you know,
[36:57.840 --> 37:04.080]  and there's a reason why a lot of the people whose site, you know, like Kottke, who's still
[37:04.080 --> 37:11.440]  going strong, but also, you know, was a web developer. Heather Armstrong at deuce.com was
[37:11.440 --> 37:17.280]  a web developer and could build her own website. You know, being able to build your own website
[37:17.280 --> 37:23.440]  was not necessarily required, but you either needed to do it yourself or have somebody you
[37:23.440 --> 37:29.120]  could, who could do it for you. Right. You couldn't just snap the pieces together. Right.
[37:29.120 --> 37:35.040]  Well, the way I'm doing it is definitely not the recommended way. You know, it's like my way,
[37:35.040 --> 37:39.200]  I would not, you know, I think I say that most of my, my writeups, I'm like, look, I'm going to show
[37:39.200 --> 37:45.440]  you how I, I'll show you how I do it and do not do this. Like, this is the anti-pattern unless,
[37:45.440 --> 37:50.720]  I mean, I also have a computer science degree and you know, unless you really, really like
[37:50.720 --> 37:55.200]  this stuff. And for me, you know, like I, like I wrote about in Wired the other day, you know,
[37:55.200 --> 38:00.960]  there is something really healing and palliative about this kind of work for me that has a deep
[38:00.960 --> 38:05.760]  connection to my childhood. And, you know, it's like kind of this safe space server work. And so
[38:05.760 --> 38:12.080]  like, I am not turned off by it, but you could basically, I think, fire up like a ghost instance,
[38:12.080 --> 38:15.760]  you know, shared, you know, like a hosted ghost instance. And you basically have everything you
[38:15.760 --> 38:20.720]  need. It does the memberships, it does the newsletters, it does the blog, you have control
[38:20.720 --> 38:25.280]  over the design if you want, but you don't have to mess with it. And you have complete ownership
[38:25.280 --> 38:34.640]  of the whole stack and requires a relatively little technical sort of input. And so I think,
[38:34.640 --> 38:41.200]  you know, that's, that's, that's pretty great. But yeah, definitely the, my, my tech stack is not,
[38:41.200 --> 38:46.560]  not recommended. You know, it's like, you, you, you protest too much. We're from,
[38:46.560 --> 38:52.320]  well, we're from this era, you know, I feel like this is a great example of just carrying forward
[38:52.320 --> 38:56.800]  your baggage, you know, throughout your entire life. Like we carry all this psychic baggage with
[38:56.800 --> 39:01.520]  us and all this, you know, the physical baggage of like injuries and stuff. And like, one of the
[39:01.520 --> 39:05.920]  things that definitely I think I'm carrying forward is like this need, this technical
[39:05.920 --> 39:09.680]  obsession baggage where I'm like, oh, if it's not, if it doesn't have 400 movement points,
[39:09.680 --> 39:13.760]  if it's not, if it doesn't have 400 moving parts that I have to compile something in the,
[39:13.760 --> 39:18.000]  in the terminal, that it's not really doing the work. There is something I find meditative about
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.640]  all that crap. So that's how I justify it. All right. Let me take a break here and thank
[39:22.640 --> 39:27.360]  our first sponsor. It's our good friends at flat file. One of the worst ways that you can spend

[40:30.960 --> 40:40.880]  file dot I O I'll repeat that URL for you. Flat file dot I O. So you mentioned the piece you just
[40:40.880 --> 40:48.080]  wrote, uh, I think a couple days ago and wired. It just came out yesterday. Yeah. Well, I started
[40:48.080 --> 40:52.880]  it three years ago, but it came out yesterday. This is so amazing that it came out right before
[40:52.880 --> 40:57.760]  you're on the show. Cause this is how I think about it too. And I've, I've been writing less
[40:59.680 --> 41:06.160]  code than I did when I was younger. And it's, it's like, I don't want to say my skills have
[41:06.160 --> 41:17.280]  been atrophying, but my, my priorities to bubble up something on my weird moon man to do system
[41:17.280 --> 41:23.600]  to bubble it up to, okay, here's the thing I'm actually going to spend the next this afternoon
[41:23.600 --> 41:28.160]  on it to be a programming project as opposed to writing something or reading something or
[41:28.800 --> 41:36.400]  it it's, it's gotten lower and I've made an effort in recent months to sort of do a little
[41:36.400 --> 41:40.400]  more of that. There's nothing, I don't really have a lot that I could, that's visible. And
[41:40.400 --> 41:45.840]  if there's anything I need to do going forward the rest of this year differently, it's to actually
[41:45.840 --> 41:50.960]  write about more of them. Right. Daring Fireball used to have a lot more posts. I'd say every once
[41:50.960 --> 41:55.200]  in a while I get stuck reading an old old posts on Daring Fireball and I'm like, Hey, this was
[41:55.200 --> 42:00.800]  pretty good back then. But just explaining how, how I made a little thing that does a thing.
[42:00.800 --> 42:06.400]  Yeah. And I've started making more little things, but I haven't taken the time to actually write
[42:06.400 --> 42:13.920]  them up. But, uh, the, the, the mental aspect of it that you mentioned is so true for me. I,
[42:13.920 --> 42:25.440]  I find it to be therapeutic and, and depending on my mood, it almost necessary. And it's interesting.
[42:25.440 --> 42:30.240]  I can't, I should be able to write because this is what I do. I talk about this stuff and I write
[42:30.240 --> 42:35.680]  about this stuff and I consider myself both a writer and a programmer. So I should be able
[42:35.680 --> 42:42.640]  to express myself more clearly about how I see the difference between writing like a, like a
[42:42.640 --> 42:51.280]  like a new iPhone review, like a multi-thousand word iPhone review and writing some kind of
[42:51.280 --> 42:56.480]  computer program to run, you know, like on my server or something like that. There are similar
[42:56.480 --> 43:05.520]  parts to it, but there's something fundamentally more satisfying about programming. It's like,
[43:05.520 --> 43:12.720]  I feel more compelled to do prose writing, but it's the programming that is, Hey, this is neat.
[43:12.720 --> 43:16.240]  And there's a thing you mentioned in it that once you get a piece of code running, it, it,
[43:16.240 --> 43:20.320]  it doesn't just feel like you made something. It feels like you've made something that has a bit
[43:20.320 --> 43:29.040]  of life to it. Yeah. Yeah. How do you decide? So for example, with this article, how do you decide
[43:29.040 --> 43:33.840]  that this is going to go on, you're going to submit this to wired and not host it at
[43:33.840 --> 43:42.080]  craigmod.com? Well, um, that's a good question. I mean, it's such a weird distinction to make. I
[43:42.080 --> 43:51.120]  mean, but part of it, part of it is, is a, is a personal recognition that, so, okay, let's back
[43:51.120 --> 43:55.120]  up, let's back up. So part of it is I just want to work with editors cause I want to get better
[43:55.120 --> 44:00.880]  at writing. So that's like, that's, that's, I would say 90, that's 70% of it. So it's just, I,
[44:00.880 --> 44:05.600]  I, I want to get better at writing and just writing on my own and writing from my newsletters
[44:05.600 --> 44:11.600]  or blogs or whatever. Um, I can, you know, that's, that activates a certain muscle of just doing the
[44:11.600 --> 44:18.960]  work. But if you go to the gym, you can go to the gym, you know, uh, five times a week for 10 years
[44:18.960 --> 44:24.400]  and you could be doing, you could just have stupid habits that you're stuck doing. And so I find like
[44:24.400 --> 44:28.720]  working with an editor is kind of like hiring a personal trainer or whatever and working with a
[44:28.720 --> 44:36.320]  great editor is just such a joy. And I know that working with the right editor will elevate, um,
[44:36.320 --> 44:43.040]  the quality of a piece, uh, far higher than I could get it on my own. And so, you know,
[44:43.040 --> 44:50.000]  I was working on a novel for years and part of that process was, um, applying for fellowships
[44:50.000 --> 44:55.440]  and applying for workshops. I was at, I did the Iowa writer's workshop program. They have like a,
[44:55.440 --> 45:02.400]  a two month intensive summer edition of the, of the, the fiction, the writer's workshop there.
[45:02.400 --> 45:07.120]  And, uh, you know, going out there and doing that, that was, these were all things to basically force
[45:07.120 --> 45:13.600]  myself to work with people who have spent a lot of time thinking about this, these kinds of, of,
[45:13.600 --> 45:19.280]  of writing in that case, the writing fiction and in the case of working with, uh, with editors at
[45:19.280 --> 45:24.800]  Wired or the Atlantic, you know, doing this sort of nonfiction, this, you know, 1000 to 1500 word
[45:24.800 --> 45:29.760]  or 800 to 1500 word nonfiction stuff for a publication like Wired or, or the Atlantic.
[45:30.320 --> 45:35.920]  So a big part of it is just, if I write something that I'm, I'm kind of excited about that, I feel
[45:35.920 --> 45:43.360]  like, you know, hits on like a, a quote unquote sort of truth that I haven't seen articulated
[45:43.360 --> 45:47.600]  clearly, uh, recently, you know, a lot of these things are kind of like have been done before
[45:47.600 --> 45:51.520]  written about 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, it was something recent hasn't come
[45:51.520 --> 45:55.360]  up that's kind of hit on the same notes. Um, and then I feel like, okay, yeah, there's something
[45:55.360 --> 46:02.160]  interesting going on here that I feel is like, is very true for me. And I would like this idea to
[46:02.160 --> 46:11.440]  have the, the ability to impact or to reach as many people as possible. Wired just has a much
[46:11.440 --> 46:15.920]  bigger readership than anything I'm ever going to cobble together. So that's, that's the other 30%.
[46:15.920 --> 46:22.880]  So it's 70% working with a great editor to make me better, um, and to, to learn how to think about
[46:22.880 --> 46:28.000]  writing better stories and to elevate the story itself. And then the 30% is just,
[46:28.000 --> 46:34.000]  is just, is the platform. Um, and then somewhere in there, there's the payment component, which is,
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.720]  uh, less important now because I have the membership program, but is nice. Like Wired
[46:38.720 --> 46:43.760]  actually pays pretty well. Like I got paid decently for that piece. Um, and so that's,
[46:43.760 --> 46:49.280]  that's, you know, altogether, that's kind of, that's how I end up deciding, uh, just to put
[46:49.280 --> 46:53.440]  things in, in certain publications. And so when I, like I said, I wrote this, I started writing
[46:53.440 --> 47:00.000]  this three years ago and I wrote it for one of my newsletters, the Roden newsletter. Um, and
[47:00.000 --> 47:03.840]  a lot of times at the end of that road newsletter, I'll have like a big essay or I'll put, uh, I kind
[47:03.840 --> 47:08.240]  of, I don't go into it thinking I'm going to write an essay. I have this, this topic I want to kind
[47:08.240 --> 47:15.440]  of play with and it turns into an essay often. And I was thinking about server work, um, working on,
[47:15.440 --> 47:19.920]  I'd done all this server stuff. I moved off of one of my, one of those old racks based servers.
[47:19.920 --> 47:25.920]  And I found the process of that move to be so healing and, and really important to be at that
[47:25.920 --> 47:31.760]  moment. And, uh, and I started writing about that and I got that Roden essay done and I thought,
[47:31.760 --> 47:37.360]  you know, there's something more here. I don't want to just put this in the newsletter and then
[47:37.360 --> 47:44.000]  have that be done. I want to think about a different place for this and I'd like to work
[47:44.000 --> 47:49.120]  with an editor on this. And so that was kind of why I held it back. Um, but, but sometimes
[47:49.840 --> 47:53.920]  I'll put stuff in the, in the newsletter and it just takes off like crazy. Like the,
[47:54.480 --> 48:01.760]  like the, my fast software is the best software essay was originally in a newsletter. And then
[48:01.760 --> 48:09.040]  that had such an immediate visceral reach from just the newsletter. I gave it its own,
[48:09.040 --> 48:12.880]  I ripped it out of the newsletter. I cleaned it up a bit, gave it its own URL on my,
[48:12.880 --> 48:19.200]  on my, my homepage under the essays header. And, um, that thing had crazy reach. So sometimes
[48:19.200 --> 48:25.520]  you're like, you can have massive reach if you're an independent writer, but I find it so difficult
[48:25.520 --> 48:31.600]  to tell what is going to have, what's going to sort of strike that chord. And, uh, and so I find
[48:31.600 --> 48:35.600]  a good way to, to kind of, if you have a piece that you really want to get out in the world,
[48:35.600 --> 48:40.080]  uh, to a bigger audience than going with the Atlantic or wired, if you can, uh,
[48:40.080 --> 48:44.640]  if you can get it in there as a way to kind of hack that Ben Thompson and I have talked about
[48:44.640 --> 48:52.240]  the fact that neither, neither of us has an editor and yeah, uh, it's not that I'm opposed,
[48:52.240 --> 48:57.280]  but I'm certainly not going to hire one for daring firewall. Right. I mean, I don't know
[48:57.280 --> 49:04.400]  why I even laugh at that. I could, you know, uh, it, it is an interesting skill, I think.
[49:04.400 --> 49:08.800]  And I'm not even saying, I'm not trying to say like my writing could not be improved through
[49:08.800 --> 49:17.520]  editing, but like for a couple of years, I was writing back page columns for Mac world
[49:17.520 --> 49:23.280]  a couple of times a year. Um, which is an interesting experience. And, and at the,
[49:23.280 --> 49:29.040]  when I first started doing it, the money was very meaningful to me and it's a similar thing. Mac
[49:29.040 --> 49:37.360]  world paid very well for a back page column and, and it was important. Um, it was fascinating
[49:37.360 --> 49:42.160]  because my dad was incredibly impressed. It's like, I think he finally understood what I do
[49:42.160 --> 49:48.560]  because he could, he could go and buy a copy of Mac world and open it up to the back page. And
[49:48.560 --> 49:58.800]  there's my picture and my, my byline, you know, in print. Um, but my time writing the Mac world
[49:58.800 --> 50:05.200]  columns, I don't recall ever once having one really seriously improved through editing,
[50:05.200 --> 50:12.720]  not, and I, I, I'm sure that there are people who worked at Mac world who are listening to this.
[50:12.720 --> 50:23.040]  I don't mean to slag on their editors at all. It just, I, you know, I've always been a pretty
[50:23.040 --> 50:32.320]  careful self editing writer. It's, uh, and a few times when my, my columns were changed, it was
[50:32.320 --> 50:41.440]  for the worse because they were edited slightly for space. And I felt like I already had no
[50:41.440 --> 50:47.440]  needless words to omit, you know, and that the point was lost. Right. Well, I, you know,
[50:48.640 --> 50:54.560]  it is, it is, I think finding great editors is critical, you know, and I think that's,
[50:54.560 --> 51:00.640]  that's why when I, when I, um, say I'm pitching to wired or whatever, I'm really pitching to specific
[51:00.640 --> 51:05.120]  people and I'm only, I only want to work with this person or that person, you know, and that's,
[51:05.120 --> 51:09.520]  that's because I know that they're going to, they're going to elevate it. But even with my
[51:09.520 --> 51:18.000]  book last year, um, you know, Kisa by Kisa, um, I worked with, I actually had, I had two,
[51:19.280 --> 51:28.400]  two editors, really. Um, one was sort of a technical copy focused editor that definitely
[51:28.400 --> 51:32.160]  made it better. There were just all these inconsistencies and stuff. And then I had
[51:32.160 --> 51:38.560]  another editor who was, was, was sort of on a bigger picture level. And these are super
[51:38.560 --> 51:45.200]  talented people and, uh, super accomplished people. And they absolutely made that manuscript
[51:45.200 --> 51:49.680]  better. You know, like, and a lot, a lot of it for me is just having the conversations,
[51:49.680 --> 51:53.920]  you know, that there's this like old adage of like, how do you, how do you help a physicist
[51:53.920 --> 51:58.400]  do, you know, work at the blackboard? It's like, buy him a dog, you know, just give him someone
[51:58.400 --> 52:03.520]  to talk to. That's all it's all you need. A lot of times it's just someone to articulate, like,
[52:03.520 --> 52:09.200]  what did you do today? What are you doing in this paragraph? Um, now scarred, uh, the guy who wrote
[52:09.200 --> 52:15.760]  the, my struggles, uh, mega, you know, auto auto novel. Um, you know, I don't know if you're
[52:15.760 --> 52:22.320]  familiar with his work. He's, I think he's Norwegian. He wrote like, like, I think like
[52:22.320 --> 52:28.720]  90% of all Norwegian people have read his novels. Um, but he wrote this two, 3000 page kind of
[52:28.720 --> 52:35.840]  pseudo autobiographical fiction thing. Um, and part of that process for him writing was that
[52:35.840 --> 52:40.480]  at the end of every day, every day, he would write and then he would call his editor and he
[52:40.480 --> 52:46.640]  would read to the editor, everything he wrote that day, uh, just as a way of like, am I crazy?
[52:46.640 --> 52:52.400]  Is this shit? You know, it's like, um, is it, does this make sense? You know, it just, I think like
[52:52.400 --> 52:59.440]  that sounding board for certain writers can be so powerful. And, uh, and so that's for, for me,
[52:59.440 --> 53:04.560]  that's definitely, um, kind of like what, where I'm reaching for when I'm, when I'm reaching to
[53:04.560 --> 53:13.600]  work with an editor. That said, I have had essays turn, they turn very into very different things
[53:13.600 --> 53:20.880]  because I was young and I, and I was nervous and I was publishing with a big name brand publication
[53:20.880 --> 53:25.920]  and I was afraid to push back. And I've had things go out that I'm, I'm actually somewhat
[53:25.920 --> 53:31.600]  embarrassed by because the, the message was changed so dramatically from what I originally
[53:31.600 --> 53:37.920]  intended to write to what ended up getting published that, um, I did. I, I, I definitely,
[53:37.920 --> 53:44.640]  I think it made me cautious about editors and it's made me more aware of what you should fight for
[53:44.640 --> 53:49.200]  when you're working with someone and not to be afraid to fight for that because, you know,
[53:49.200 --> 53:53.920]  the worst thing that can happen is that you have this, this message that's been kind of perverted
[53:53.920 --> 53:58.400]  by the editorial process. Um, because the publication can sometimes have an image for
[53:58.400 --> 54:03.360]  where they want the piece to go, uh, for whatever reason. And, uh, you know, that may, if that's not
[54:03.360 --> 54:08.160]  aligned with what you want, then definitely pull out, you know, if talking to young writers out
[54:08.160 --> 54:12.880]  there who may end up working with editors, like, you know, own, make sure you know where you want
[54:12.880 --> 54:18.480]  that thing to go and, and fight for it, fight for, fight for that, that core on a sentence
[54:18.480 --> 54:22.560]  by sentence level, you might have to give up some things, but like the, if the core message is being
[54:22.560 --> 54:27.440]  perverted, definitely pull back. And, you know, in some cases, maybe even just pull the piece,
[54:27.440 --> 54:32.640]  if it's not going to go where you want it to go. My problem, my other problem with the Mac world
[54:32.640 --> 54:43.040]  back page column was that I'm fundamentally too selfish about daring fireball and the pieces I
[54:43.040 --> 54:47.840]  see, and this is where I, I think I see the difference like this, your, your column here
[54:48.560 --> 54:56.080]  that you just published in wired has a different feel to it than your, your special projects
[54:56.080 --> 55:02.640]  writing, right? Your special projects writing is more intimate. And you've got a voice that is
[55:04.960 --> 55:08.960]  sort of knowing, because you know, you're writing for this audience of people who already know who
[55:08.960 --> 55:14.960]  you are, as opposed to the giant megaphone of wired where you're writing for an audience where
[55:14.960 --> 55:19.200]  I'll bet most of the people who've already read it had never heard of you before, or don't recall
[55:19.200 --> 55:24.960]  hearing, you know, right, right. My problem with the Mac world back page is that they were just,
[55:24.960 --> 55:30.400]  they were the same things that I write for daring fireball, except when I wrote for the back page,
[55:30.400 --> 55:36.400]  they had to be exactly 700 words or whatever nine, I think it was like 900 words. And if I had
[55:36.400 --> 55:43.040]  a 600 word idea, well, I had to figure out a way to pad it. And if I had a 1200 word idea,
[55:43.040 --> 55:49.920]  I had to figure out a way to cut it. And I was very frustrated by that. And but I also all you
[55:49.920 --> 55:57.760]  know, it I love still like Mac world, but at the time Mac or the Mac world back page was that was
[55:57.760 --> 56:02.880]  the shiznet. Right? That's where that's where David Pogue used to write. That's where Steven
[56:02.880 --> 56:08.560]  Levy used to write in the 80s. And there I was, you know, this is what I wanted to do when I
[56:08.560 --> 56:12.480]  started writing about this stuff is be on the back page of Mac world. And then as soon as I got there,
[56:12.480 --> 56:17.680]  I wanted to not be there anymore. Well, when were you when were you doing the Mac world?
[56:17.680 --> 56:21.280]  It was like 2006 to 2008. I want to say,
[56:21.280 --> 56:25.040]  Do you? Do you feel like that had a, like a marked effect on your
[56:25.920 --> 56:28.880]  profile? Like, do you think that that brought in a bunch of during five?
[56:28.880 --> 56:33.120]  Yeah, it certainly didn't hurt. You know, I think I think I did just the right amount of it. I don't
[56:33.120 --> 56:38.400]  want to complain too much. But but the fundamental tension I felt was that when I did a back page
[56:38.400 --> 56:47.040]  column that I didn't feel came out right. And yeah, that that hard length limit is not a good
[56:47.040 --> 56:53.280]  skill that I have. And and by by exercising my writing muscles writing it during fireball,
[56:54.080 --> 57:01.360]  I wasn't building that muscle, right, like writing to a set back page column length, you know, I,
[57:01.360 --> 57:08.240]  those muscles have atrophied for me. So if I turned in a bad column, I felt terribly guilty
[57:08.240 --> 57:13.120]  about it just terrible, because it's like this is I just knew that this wasn't the best work
[57:13.120 --> 57:18.800]  that I could do. And here I here I am so lucky that I'm able to write at on this page that I've
[57:18.800 --> 57:25.520]  always wanted to be on. But then on the other hand, when I'd write a really good one, I would
[57:25.520 --> 57:32.640]  feel terrible that it was at Macworld not at during fireball. Right, right, right. Because
[57:32.640 --> 57:37.680]  you're not Yeah, you're not you're not building the foundation of your, your castle or whatever.
[57:37.680 --> 57:43.120]  Right. You know, you're giving you're giving that brick to someone else. Yeah, no, that's I think
[57:43.120 --> 57:48.800]  that's a very universal feeling for a lot of people who do independent work and then, you know,
[57:48.800 --> 57:53.920]  go off to either work in a company or work at a publication. And that's what you know, part of
[57:53.920 --> 57:58.880]  what's been interesting about the substack thing is like basically people building up inside of a
[57:58.880 --> 58:06.800]  big, a big publication, the cache and the name value their brand inside of a pub, and then
[58:06.800 --> 58:13.520]  taking that brand value and monetizing it, you know, basically going in reverse. And
[58:15.040 --> 58:18.640]  I think that's really fascinating. You know, I think in some ways, it's really smart.
[58:20.400 --> 58:26.480]  And in other ways, I think a lot of people will find out that being you know, doing independent
[58:26.480 --> 58:31.040]  work is exhausting in a way that, you know, having having the the institution there is actually quite
[58:31.040 --> 58:36.880]  helpful sometimes. Right. No, no, no question about it. I wonder how long it'll last for some
[58:36.880 --> 58:48.160]  people, you know? Yeah. I know. So, you know, Andrew Sullivan has a big, big high name substack
[58:48.160 --> 58:54.480]  now. And he came from the world of magazine editing, but then had his personal blog for
[58:54.480 --> 58:59.680]  number of years during the Bush administration. And, you know, I think he's been pretty clear
[58:59.680 --> 59:05.760]  that he effectively burned out on it. Yeah. And I just wonder, you know, what's the difference
[59:05.760 --> 59:12.720]  going to be this time? And and he's enormously prolific. I mean, you know, his weekly newsletter,
[59:12.720 --> 59:19.200]  it's like, I can't believe that every week on the week, he can write that much. Right. Well,
[59:19.200 --> 59:22.960]  there's a couple of newsletter writers that I just kind of want to I want to like pull them aside and
[59:22.960 --> 59:29.600]  go, you don't have to write this. Right. It's just it's too much sometimes. Sometimes. I don't know
[59:29.600 --> 59:35.760]  about you, but my newsletter folder in my inbox, it's like increasingly difficult to go in there
[59:35.760 --> 59:43.360]  because I'm like, okay, all right, we've got another 5000 word, you know, PC. It's, it's so
[59:44.320 --> 59:49.200]  it's so good. I'm, I'm blown away by the by the prolific nature of some of these,
[59:49.200 --> 59:54.720]  some of these writers. And like, I think it really does bring up sustainability issues like psychic
[59:54.720 --> 01:00:01.680]  sustainability issues, because it's like, you can burn out for sure. And, you know, if you build up
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:06.800]  a certain momentum, and you feel like you, your readers have an expectation, I think that's that's
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:11.440]  where the burnout happens is like you're writing these 5000 word giant newsletters a couple times
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:16.160]  a week. And, you know, you want to take a break, but you're worried everyone's going to freak out.
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:19.760]  But the reality is, is that no one's going to freak out. And everyone's going to be like,
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:24.480]  hey, take a break. That's fine. But we can kind of back ourselves into these weird psychic corners.
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:28.800]  And, you know, and that's where you that's where you get into trouble, I think. So,
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:32.640]  all right, let me take another break here and thank our next friends, our good friends at
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:38.800]  Squarespace. Squarespace is a longtime supporter of the show, you've heard me talk about them,

[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:28.800]  let's get into some complaining. Fast software is fast software is good software. That was a
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:34.160]  good article. What's what? Summarize the gist of your argument. Fast software is good software.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:42.800]  You know, software that I think anytime your software basically fast software allows you
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:50.480]  to maintain a stove, a slow flow state. So you can anytime software slows down and and this is
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:56.080]  not just you know, whatever, if you're doing ml processing or whatever, doing a big database chunk,
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:00.640]  you know, whatever dump or whatever, yeah, that's gonna take time. Sure, if you're rendering frames
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:04.480]  or that's gonna take time, I'm not talking about that space of software. I'm talking about kind of
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:10.400]  interface components. I'm talking about keyboard accessibility. I'm talking about just the speed
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:15.760]  at which the software moves with you. So if that, you know, bicycle for the mind metaphor that
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:21.200]  Jobs is, you know, there's always reference. If you take that as kind of the base for this,
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:27.520]  it's like you want the bike to just be really beautifully tuned and you want the gears to change
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:32.400]  when you change the gears immediately. You don't want the derailleur to get stuck. You don't want
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:38.000]  the brakes to squeal. You just want the thing to feel like a beautifully engineered, well-oiled
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:44.160]  machine. And fastness, I think, is a core part of that. So it's like as if you want to move between,
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:47.760]  you know, this window and that window, if you want to carry a piece of data from this window
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:52.000]  to that window, if you want to select something, if you want to fix something, if you want to
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.600]  manipulate something, it all should happen instantaneously, I think, at the speed at which
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:02.320]  you want to do that action. That's kind of the base of it. I sometimes think back to
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:11.520]  my days doing print graphic design and learning QuarkXPress at the Drexel student newspaper.
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:20.560]  And how incredibly powerful QuarkXPress, I know it still exists, I'm sure it still
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:25.600]  does the same stuff it does. What do you use for your book? Do you use InDesign?
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:27.360]  InDesign, yeah.
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:35.040]  InDesign was Quark for Adobe. I mean, InDesign is, you know, it used to be that there was Quark
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:44.560]  and PageMaker, and PageMaker sort of fell out of relevancy, and Adobe sort of backed the wrong
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:53.760]  horse there. And then InDesign felt right at home to somebody who knew Quark. And it was,
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:58.160]  you know, I think it was unofficially codenamed the Quark Killer at Adobe.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:05.120]  But I think back to like the mid-90s and how at the student newspaper, and, you know, we had old
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:13.520]  computers too, old Macs, you know, and the whole place more or less spent its entire budget on
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:21.600]  buying new Macs every couple years just to keep the thing running. Quark was soand I know people
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:28.160]  used to complain about Quark the company, but Quark, you know, and that they apparently were
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:36.720]  run by relatively unpleasant people, and that they had onerous licensing terms. But man, the app was
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:45.200]  so lean and mean and fast, and it made thingsanything that could be fast was fast and precise,
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:54.720]  very precise. And I still remember keyboard shortcuts, and I remember that if you selected
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:59.680]  an item on the pasteboard and were using the arrow keys to nudge it around, I think it defaulted to
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:04.080]  like hundredths of an inch, and if you wanted to make it thousandths of an inch, you just held down
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:08.880]  the option key while you used the arrows. And just little things like that. And then if there was
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:13.280]  something else that was similar, like you'd have to, you know, you wanted more people to use it,
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:17.280]  like you'd have to, you know, you wanted more precise nudging, guess what? You used the option
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:26.960]  key. I don't know, and it's like there's so muchit was so fast on those old computers. Imagine how
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:32.400]  fast it could be today, and yet so much of our software doesn't have that feel, and it doesn't
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:38.240]  have that precision. And one of the thingsI know you and I have been kibitzing behind the
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:47.360]  scenes before we come on, but talking about frustrations with iOS and maybe iPadOS in
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:53.600]  particular, but I still think it'sI don't know what the answer is, but I know that Apple didn't
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:59.280]  find it yet, to the question of how do you precisely select text on a touch screen.
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:07.520]  It is incredible how often I'm trying to select text across lines and can't quite get the start
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:13.840]  and end exactly where I want it, whereas 25 years ago I was never off by a character. I justand
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:21.840]  I never had to think about it. Yeah, no, I've been thinking about this quite a bit over the
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:27.520]  last couple days because I figured we'd dig into this world, and I think like what'sfor me,
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:37.040]  the answer to iPadOS is the MacBook M1. I justthat's it. I've really been thinking
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:46.960]  a lot about the miracle that is macOS, how actually iOS feels like what you'd expect
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:54.240]  software or operating systems to work like in a certain way. And in a way, iOS is really
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:08:01.040]  the sensible operating system. Everything about it is totally sensible. Everything is sandboxed.
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:08.880]  Everything is locked down. There's walls everywhere. On an iPhone, or on a phone-sized
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:14.880]  device, I think it is one of the most perfect instantiations of an OS out there. It's like
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:19.120]  where you're just doing single tasks. You're not really moving data between things. You're not
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:24.160]  trying to do anything that's too complicated. It's like an in-and-out kind of device.
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:29.200]  Theoretically, I know we all live with these things attached to our faces now,
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:37.520]  but theoretically, the use case for a mobile phone or mobile phone-sized internet device
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:43.520]  is to go in and get a little bit of information, pay for something, whatever, and then get out.
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:51.360]  It's meant to be in and out. And I think iOS is superb. It is so good. It is easy to set up,
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:57.440]  very little vectors for attacks. You don't have to run antivirus software. You don't have to
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:03.840]  worry about what you're installing. In a lot of ways, it's incredible. And then the problem
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:10.240]  was putting it on the iPad and then giving the iPad such an amazing screen. It's such
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:18.400]  an amazing processor in that 2018 iPad Pro and being like, here you go. Here's a Ferrari engine,
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:26.800]  but we've strapped it to the Homer Simpson car. You're just like, what? I can't use this thing.
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:34.160]  I can't maximize the power of this engine, except for in very weird ways where it's a single
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:40.560]  task of like, okay, I can render this video really quickly. But the process of importing the video
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:45.760]  from my high-end camera is onerous and impossible. There's no file system that I can access.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:51.920]  You know, it's just like all these things that kind of got in the way of really maximizing
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:10:00.640]  the value of what was on offer. But I'd say it's really difficult to balance out that incredible
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:07.360]  simplicity of the iPhone experience and really the kind of like tuned perfection of that use case
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:14.400]  for general computing. And so anyway, the tension for me with iPad was always that.
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:22.080]  And then at the same time, you know, 2018, we were deep in the quagmire hell of the Intel MacBook.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:27.120]  It was the worst keyboard. You know, it was the processors weren't getting any faster. It was
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:31.840]  expensive. They were hot. The battery lasted like what, two hours? The keyboard was the worst part
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:37.920]  because that was self-inflicted on Apple's part, right? It was like the so stupid, just the added
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:43.600]  indignity of these are not great computers. They're struggling. You know, the one that
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:49.280]  everybody wanted the retina MacBook Air was years late. And you know, it was because Intel didn't
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:55.360]  have chips that would let Apple make the Mac retina MacBook Air that they wanted to make.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:00.240]  Yeah, well, yeah, I think and that people wanted to buy, right?
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:08.640]  Yeah, no, in hindsight, the 2016 MacBook Pro is probably the worst computer Apple's ever released,
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:16.240]  like bar none. It's just, and maybe in the 90s or the 80s. Like, my history is a little fuzzy
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:20.560]  back then we couldn't, we couldn't afford Apple computers when I was a kid. So I was never paying
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:25.440]  attention to. So we were always like, if we had anything, it was I remember there's a period of
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:30.640]  Apple clones that existed. Oh, Scully. Yeah, what were they called? I forget what they were called.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:36.080]  And they even had but that was they stole like ROMs out of out of discarded Apple twos to like,
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:41.600]  is that what they did? But that was all we that was all we had Apple clone.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:48.080]  Did they clone the the ROM like in Halt? Something like that. It was they were crazy.
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:54.160]  They never really took off. No, but I mean, anyway, so I buy Apple history back there is
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:12:01.200]  extremely fuzzy. But I started with like the late, like night, whatever was released in 1999. The
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:08.320]  the the power book that was in 1999. That was my first real Mac. And I would say of all of the
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:13.840]  computers I've owned, yeah, the 2016 MacBook Pro, the keyboard didn't work. It broke on me multiple
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:20.640]  times. The USB C ports were bad. I don't know if you you, you remember, but like USB plugs just
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:24.640]  wouldn't stay. Oh, yeah, they didn't have. They didn't have the clicking mechanism. They didn't
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:28.320]  have like that docking mechanism that everything seems to have now where they have these really
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:33.600]  secure connections. Anyway, just in the battery would last 12 seconds, you know, it was just
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:38.960]  truly horrible. So I think it was all of those things together. And then you have this beautiful,
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:45.200]  super capable iPad. And you're just like, Oh, I want this to be my main computer. But I can't
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:51.760]  do anything on it. And there was a sort of stretch there. I know we've reiterated a lot in it since
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:58.400]  the M ones came out and talking about Apple's sort of, you know, that that summit that they had me and
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:06.000]  Panzarino and and Inafrid come out for where they sort of reemphasize their commitment to pro Mac
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:13.840]  hardware and software. But it was a depressing number of years because Apple doesn't explain
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:21.680]  itself. And so they're not going to say, look, the reason we're still selling a $999 MacBook Air
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:28.800]  without a retina to screen all of these years after the iPad and iPhone have gone retina and
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:35.440]  non retina just looks so bad. Even though it's, you know, a more expensive product, you know,
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:41.280]  that you can, you know, configure a MacBook Air for 1500 bucks, and yet it was still not retina
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:48.320]  looked really dated. Tim Cook gave an interview at one point where he said, and people really latched
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:54.400]  on to it, but he said something like that he does 80% of his work on an iPad. It, it created the
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:14:02.400]  perception that the Mac was on its way out, right. And you know, I never believed it, but I was
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:08.560]  worried about it. Right? Like, I would not bet on it. But I also understand why people who would
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:15.280]  have bet on it were thinking it would they weren't crazy, right? The MacBook Air really, their most
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:23.600]  popular single most popular Mac ever made by far, the MacBook Air it I somebody people who've
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:30.080]  worked in Apple stores have told me you have no idea how many people like by by what margin MacBook
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:33.920]  Air's I don't know if that's true right now. I haven't I don't know about but I would I would
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:39.600]  bet that it is though because I think most people if they're going to buy an M1 they want a portable
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:44.720]  not a Mac Mini, even though it's cool that the Mac Mini exists. And I don't think they see the value
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:52.480]  in the more expensive 13 inch MacBook Pro. I love it. I'm on I'm on I'm on a MacBook Air right now.
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:15:00.800]  It's you know, I think it's so incredibly popular. And yet they they seemingly abandoned it,
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:05.040]  right? And they get and they weren't going to explain why. They weren't going to say,
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:10.480]  Look, we know that this is outdated. We have big plans. But we can't build I mean,
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:14.400]  a part of it isn't is just Apple being Apple. And part of it is that no professional
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:18.880]  company is going to throw Intel under the bus. You know, that's just not how you do business,
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:24.320]  you know? Right. But at the same time, they're not going to do what other companies do and cut
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:29.120]  prices and say, Well, okay, the MacBook Air is getting old. But how about this? We'll sell it
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:36.400]  for $650 because it's three years this ridiculous computer is three years old. Because Apple likes
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:41.600]  to maintain their price points so that when they do come out with a new one, it's not like, oh,
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:47.360]  the new retina MacBook Air jerk the price up 50% because they've cut the price on the old one,
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:55.360]  right? So Apple, you know, and the How can I forget the trashcan Mac Pro, which had which
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:16:00.640]  languished for even longer, right? And it was ridiculously expensive. It started at five $5,000.
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:08.640]  And, you know, five years in hadn't been updated. It looked like it was it was it was a dark period.
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:18.720]  And especially if, like, me and you, you just feel like the Mac or Mac OS is the OS,
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:26.000]  where it's the bicycle for your mind. And I use my iPad a lot. And I love, you know, the iPhone.
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:33.120]  But I don't feel I don't, I, I've often used the analogy of like, feeling like you're pedaling
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:39.680]  uphill versus pedaling downhill to extend the bicycle for the mind thing. And yeah, the problem
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:45.200]  with that metaphor is that usually when you say something's going downhill, it means it's bad.
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:50.480]  Right. But that's not what I mean. I mean, it's good. It feels like the bike is propelling itself.
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:54.720]  And you don't even have to, you don't even realize, you know, you're just all you have to
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:17:00.800]  do is steer and you don't have to exert any force to make the bike go down. Whereas when,
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:06.960]  you know, I used to have for I had a six month internship, right outside Philadelphia. And at the
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:13.440]  there's a huge hill, I had to ride my bike up every morning. And it was an internship over
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:19.200]  the summer. And there were times where I've they were always never, it was never an issue. I had
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:23.360]  my own office, but there were times where I would just be drenched with sweat. But then on the way
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:29.200]  home, I got to go downhill. And it's sort of the way you want it, right? It's better to work hard
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:33.520]  to get to work. And then when the day's over, and you get to go home and have fun, you just go flying
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:44.320]  down the hill at 40 miles an hour. I have that feeling about Mac OS. And it was worrisome to me
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:49.120]  when it felt like, you know, maybe they're not committed to it. And now we have these M1 Macs.
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:58.720]  And to me, the best overall version of Mac OS in quite a while, maybe it was like Catalina was so
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:06.800]  buggy for me for most of the year. And I think in hindsight, it might be because they had to pull or
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:14.000]  chose to pull engineers to work on Big Sur so that it Big Sur would be ready for the M1, you know,
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:20.800]  Apple Silicon. And so maybe being the release right before a processor transition was sort of
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:26.480]  a bad roll of the dice for Catalina. I was just gonna say this, just this paucity of engineers
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:31.520]  issue at Apple always strikes me as insane. You know, that there's this limited number,
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:34.800]  this very, very limited number of engineers, and they have to be kind of moved between
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:41.600]  big projects. But yeah, I mean, but maybe that was the case with Catalina, like just all the
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:46.080]  heavy hitters were off somewhere else getting this thing ready for the M1.
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:49.680]  Well, it does sound like that, right? How can you be the richest company in the world
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:54.000]  and be starved for engineers? But on the other hand, there is the mythical man month, right?
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:01.520]  And that I think Apple very consistently has always understood, at least from the next
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:06.640]  reunification onward, you know, the Steve Jobs under Steve Jobs leadership that
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:13.840]  the mythical man month is real, and that you've got to keep team, however many thousands of
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:18.960]  engineers they have, they get broken up into relatively small teams. I know a bunch of people
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:23.680]  who work at Apple, but most of the people, almost everybody I know at Apple is effectively on a
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:31.040]  small team. And I think that the sort of the only way to get anything done, I, you know.
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:37.200]  Yeah, well, but I think I think that that confluence of the, you know, feeling like Apple
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:45.280]  was letting the Mac OS world sort of like dissolve, you know, in all sorts of different
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:49.600]  ways. And the MacBooks themselves were just not good machines, not reliable machines.
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:56.160]  And then Catalina being truly, for me too, really unreliable OS, you know, that just felt
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:03.200]  unpolished, which is not something you want your operating system to feel like. It's like,
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:07.840]  you want that that foundation to be as strong as possible. If you're working on all these big
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:13.520]  projects, and you know, you're essentially your life force is connected with this operating system.
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:21.920]  But the, I think, like the Phoenix rising ascendance of Big Sur plus the M ones, for me,
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:29.520]  has just really made me feel good. I just feel, I don't know about you, but I just feel like, yes,
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:35.520]  and and you know, the the corollary of that, too, is like, I just don't worry now about iPad OS.
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:42.400]  It's like, Oh, okay, this, okay, as long as Mac OS is being cared for, and then truly, like,
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:47.360]  this operating system is, I think, the aberration, right? So it's like, if you think about what
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:53.600]  happened to get to this point of this, like, and I really think Mac OS is a beautiful combination
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:21:00.320]  of usability and power. And, you know, even some of the the system, the security stuff they've
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:05.920]  added, doesn't really irk me as much as it irks other folks. But like, I think some of it is
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:12.640]  some of it is is useful. But like, the fact that next had to happen, right, so Steve getting kicked
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:19.680]  out of Apple had to happen next had to happen. Next OS being such an incredible OS, even if it
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:25.600]  if it had so few user seats in the world. And then that being, you know, the foundation for
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:34.880]  Mac OS X, OS X, or Apple, another thing that had to happen in there is Apple needed to
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:42.080]  for us to get from there to here, Apple's own next jet, quote, unquote, next generation operating
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:50.000]  system efforts had to spectacularly fail. Right? Because the worst thing, right, it seemed at the
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:55.200]  time that like, Copeland, maybe you weren't using a Mac in the mid 90s. But Jason and I have talked
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:59.840]  about it was that they, you know, they had these next generation, several of them. It's not worth
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:05.280]  going into the details, but they were it was always like Yoda talking to Luke Skywalker, always
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:10.960]  your eyes on the future, you know, and they were Apple was always talking about the operating
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:15.440]  systems that they plan to come out in three or four years, like crazy by today's standards,
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:19.600]  like what, how can you be talking about an operating system years in advance, while the
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:26.720]  one you're selling today is technically falling apart, and in by by then modern standards.
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:30.800]  But the it seemed at the time that the worst thing that could happen would be for this
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:37.760]  Apple's next generation operating system to fall apart, just flame out. But I think in hindsight,
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:42.400]  the really worst thing that could have happened would have been if it had just been sort of like,
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:47.440]  kind of good enough, right? And it would have, you know, then they wouldn't have had to buy next,
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.880]  we probably would have been left with something far less elegant and durable, right, that we'd
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:58.320]  still be talking about in the year 2021, as though it's, it's, like you said, a Phoenix rising from
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:05.360]  the ashes and is resurgent. You know, sometimes it's better to fail completely than to sort of
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:06.960]  half ass your way through it.
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:12.800]  Yeah, well, and I mean, look at the thing that they're able to pick up and run with. I mean, the
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:20.800]  fact that that this massive consumer, consumer focused facing OS has a BSD core to it, the fact
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:25.840]  that there's a terminal that you can drop into and kind of install and compile and run pretty much
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:33.440]  any piece of software you can find in the world. Like, I am so grateful for this flexibility. And
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:39.360]  then on top of it being able to kind of do a certain level of scripting. And, you know, I, I,
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:46.160]  I find it to be a pleasurable universe to live in, you know, and this is a universe I live in for,
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:53.120]  you know, sometimes 10, 15 hours a day. And I think it's, this is why in that like fast software,
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:24:01.680]  the best software essay, like I have this kind of passionate slash crazy obsession with this stuff
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:10.240]  is that this is a fundamental tool for most humans like living. This is the main tool for most of us
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:15.680]  living today who are doing a certain kind of work out there in the world. And like, to not, like,
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:22.960]  to not expect the best version of that tool is crazy. It's like tantamount to like, being like,
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:28.640]  Oh, hey, I'm going to use I'm a carpenter. And the hammer I'm going to use, like, sometimes the
[01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:32.320]  handles is gonna is just gonna fold in on itself is just gonna break the handles that we don't,
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:35.920]  we just don't know how to make a good handle. And so I'm going to be hammering some nails and like,
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:39.200]  I don't know, one out of every five hammers, like the things that's going to kind of fall apart,
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:42.320]  and I got to put a new handle on it. And that's just, that's just the hammers we got to live
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:46.080]  with. That's the hammer. It's like, no, that's insane. Like figure out how to make a good hammer.
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:51.520]  Like that's, that's crazy. You would never as a carpenter accept that. And so I feel similarly,
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:58.240]  the problem with software and OS is that it's obviously so complex and so abstract that for
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:03.920]  most people, they can't articulate what it is that doesn't feel right about the tool. And so when I
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:09.280]  write essays like that, I'm just trying to give, like engineers and folks working in companies,
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:15.040]  the fodder to be like, look, this is what, this is what I want us to aim for, you know, and I've
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:22.160]  had a lot of CEOs and, and independent software developers write to me and say, thank you for
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:27.200]  that. We've used this as like a, as a blueprint to kind of like, to think about features and to
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:32.560]  think about optimizations. And, you know, I think, like Patrick Collison's, you know,
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:35.760]  spoken to me about it. And, you know, I think that's, it's kind of a philosophy
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:40.880]  internally that Stripe had been operating under, you know, this, this idea of fast quickness and,
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:46.880]  you know, the API fastness and API smartness. And, you know, I think their company is a great
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:52.880]  example of, of doing that well leads to success, you know, and like we were talking about earlier
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:57.920]  about these abstract things that you invest in, like, well, if I, if I invest in making it fast,
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:01.600]  because what you're talking about when you're talking about speed and software is effectively
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:06.000]  effectively infrastructure and infrastructure, like I talk about in that, that wired essay
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:10.640]  is something that a lot of people have a difficult time understanding the value of,
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:15.600]  right? Because it doesn't have this immediate return, but you have to believe it's almost like
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:21.440]  a theology of, of, of software here is that you have to believe that the investment in this stuff
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:26.560]  is going to lead you to some sort of, you know, afterlife heaven, you know, in, in, in just
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:31.920]  pleasure ability and joy that is being spread to, you know, the, whatever potentially millions
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:36.160]  or billions of users of your software out in the world. I think that's really, there's almost like
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:41.920]  an ethical component to it because so many people are affected by these decisions and that to give
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:48.720]  those people a smooth, beautiful tool is just, to me, it's like so fundamental when we live in
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:55.840]  these worlds all day long. I, I know that, and it's hard to peg the exact, what's the anniversary
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:00.400]  we should celebrate from Mac OS X. And I think the one that just passed a couple of weeks ago,
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:09.680]  where it's 20 years to when the first version shipped to customers in boxes for $129,
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:19.840]  here's where you go to buy it. That's as good of one as any. And I, this is one of those pieces
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:27.120]  where I started and it just never wasn't, it just wasn't coming out right. And I don't know why. But
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:35.680]  there is something about the durability of Mac OS X that it, and I think you touched on this, like,
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:41.680]  where would we be? We've got one OS that really works for me mentally. That's it. And if it
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:48.000]  wasn't for Mac OS X, I don't know what I would do. I really don't. I mean, there's only so long
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:56.480]  you could hold on to the old version and what, Windows? My son has a gaming PC, so I've gotten
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:02.560]  a taste of modern Windows and it is, I see why people like it. And my son likes his PC and I
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:10.880]  get the whole gaming thing, but it is such a, it's such a collection of technical debt and
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:21.440]  user interface cruft that it is kind of interesting that these two OSes that are seen as rivals,
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:28.160]  but they really are. There's a very different fundamental philosophy to what an operating system
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:34.800]  for users should do that Microsoft and Apple embody. And it's kind of interesting that the
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:42.800]  two that have decades, that are truly, I mean, who would have thought? And like 25 years ago,
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:48.640]  would you ever thought we're still using Macs and Windows? That wasn't how computers worked
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:55.200]  in the 80s, in the early 90s. It was like new things came and went and operating systems died
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:29:01.520]  out and were replaced. And the idea that you could have these operating systems that are
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:09.120]  here for decades, many decades, it had never been done before. So I don't know that we knew
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:15.440]  it could be done. But when you look at Mac OS X today and you look at Big Sur, it is very hard
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:19.920]  for me to find a lot of spots in the OS where you would say, well, if they were going to do it all
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:27.520]  over again, they wouldn't have all this crap here. This system preferences is the one area
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:32.320]  a couple of people have talked about. System preferences feels a little dated, especially
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:37.440]  the way that there's these little tiny boxes where you enter a bunch of things and the window
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:45.040]  isn't resizable. You were talking about some of the new security features. I think they've
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:50.880]  done a good job of finding a middle ground of annoying us versus protecting us. The problem
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:55.600]  to me is the information architecture, that it's sort of hierarchical information that isn't
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:30:01.200]  presented in a hierarchical way. And it's hard to just see it all at once. And it's very strange
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:09.520]  to me that the iPhone has a better and more logical preferences app than the Mac. Sure.
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:16.320]  Yeah. When it's the one that you're supposed to fiddle with less, right? Right. Yeah. Well,
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:22.160]  I mean, I think, you know, in to what you were saying about us having still the same
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:30.000]  OSs as we had 25 years ago. That's what makes iOS so impressive is that it came out of nowhere.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:36.720]  Is it the most used OS in the world? No, Android's got to be the most used. Android is.
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:44.960]  And it's the most used one. I was going to say something snarky, but then I realized
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:49.680]  you probably have a billion Android listeners. No, I don't. I don't think I do. No, you should see.
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:59.040]  I think you'd be shocked. I recently disabled, a couple weeks ago, I disabled Google Analytics.
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:04.400]  I actually don't even have, I don't have analytics on Daring Fireball at the moment. I guess I,
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:10.240]  that's no, I don't even, I just, just kidding. Cause you know what, here's what was, this is the
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:17.280]  way my sick mind works, Craig. I, I wanted to get rid of Google Analytics, but I was stuck choosing
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:22.480]  what to try to replace it with. And none of, you know, there's plausible and fathom are at the top
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:28.320]  of the list and seem pretty modern and very privacy minded, but I couldn't make a decision
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:32.000]  between them. And I was like, well, you know what, in the meantime, why don't I just shut off Google
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:37.600]  Analytics? Cause then I can, you know, I could get the, the little privacy thing up in the Safari
[01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:44.960]  toolbar to stop giving me a less than Sterling grade. Oh, interesting. Huh? And I thought,
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:50.480]  here's what I thought that'll force me to choose. And then it turned, it turns out I turned it off
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:54.560]  and it's like, you know what, you don't need to know how many people are coming to your website.
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:59.920]  You don't all these, all these things that, yeah, again, this is like the, the, you know,
[01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:05.440]  technical debt that you carry forward, right? It's like, we have this, you know, we put analytics on
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:10.720]  websites 20 years ago, and so we kind of keep doing it. And for me, I took Google Analytics
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:17.600]  off my site too, a couple of months ago. And I think the, the most, the only real like tension
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:24.080]  I felt was, Oh my God, I have like 18 years of unbroken data in the system. Like, do I really
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:29.680]  want to break? Do I want to break that stretch? Like that's, but I've literally never looked at
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:34.800]  the historical. I've never been like, Oh, I need to go look at what happened in, you know, 2009,
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:42.880]  July 8th, you know, my website. So I, I think that speaks in general to like an over emphasis on
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:49.360]  archives. Like I'm a really big fan of deleting tweets. I have an auto tweet, the leader thing
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:55.760]  going on. And I think also like for Twitter, this idea that all tweets should last forever was a
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:33:01.120]  flawed philosophy to start the service with. I just don't, it doesn't make sense. Like, I'm just
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:06.560]  sorry. What most of us are saying on Twitter, honestly can just disappear forever and the world
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:12.320]  will not be worse for it. Like I've, I've, as I've gotten older, I've kind of embraced this,
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:16.720]  this idea that not everything has to be archived. Like I think that was a very old school,
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:21.840]  web 1.0 idea that like nothing can be deleted. Everything should be archived.
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:24.480]  You should have all your old email from 1997.
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:34.240]  I have never searched for an email older than like a couple of weeks. I mean, I don't say never,
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:39.600]  but you know, effectively, it's, it's my party trick. You know, I'll be with an old friend
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:46.240]  and I have, I have my Gmail has my email from, from 1999 and it, I imported it all a long time
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:53.360]  ago and it's a party trick I have with old friends where I'm like, let's find the first time we
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:57.840]  contacted each other and I can just search and there it is. And I can see the first email that
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:03.280]  we sent to each other. And that is actually kind of neat to think about the Genesis of a friendship
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:08.640]  or relationship and be able to pinpoint the very first moment of contact. But yeah, aside from
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:12.640]  that, it's kind of pointless. So what do you do for the automatic Twitter deleting? What do you
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:19.200]  have? Did you write your own script? Do you use a service? Yeah, no. Well, Robin Sloan wrote a
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:25.520]  script. I mean, Robin Sloan's a really interesting example of a writer who also is very technically
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:31.200]  minded and very technically capable. And so he had, he had a, he has a Ruby script that
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:37.120]  just eats, eats your tweets. You can set, you know, how long you want to look back from. So
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:41.760]  I have everything over, over a week old being deleted and you can set a kind of like a, there's
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:48.080]  an array of tweet IDs to save. So I have a few that are saved. But that's it just runs on, it
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:53.200]  runs on my, um, digital ocean server as a cron job. You don't have to remember to do it. It just
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:35:01.920]  happens once a week. Just does it. Goodbye. Uh, I probably should do that. I don't know. I did
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:09.360]  there. There's that, that the pack rat in my back of my head wants to keep them. And there were the,
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:15.280]  in those early years of Twitter, do you remember favored favored? I don't even know how you
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:20.480]  pronounce it. It was Dean, Dean Allen's little thing where it would collect, you know, like the
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:26.720]  most, I forget. I think he purposely never explained the algorithm because he didn't
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:34.400]  want it to be gained, but effectively, uh, in a certain social circle, it was just the best
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:40.080]  jokes of the day. And it was like, this is all, this is all we did on Twitter is just crack dumb
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:44.960]  jokes and favorite the ones that we thought were funny. And then you could just check in on
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:52.000]  favorite every day and see like the best of them. And you know, and that whole circle of people is
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.560]  how I got to know Merlin, man. It's how I got to know, I might've known Merlin through the
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:36:02.640]  max circles, but like Adam, Melissa Gore and so many people came out of that. And it's like,
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:08.320]  you know, I had some good jokes. I remember one, here's one of my favorites from that era. I don't
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:13.200]  know what year it was, but the whole, this is the whole, this is the whole tweet. You don't,
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:15.920]  you don't want to know what I would do for a Klondike bar.
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:22.640]  Do you remember that ad campaign? It was, Oh yeah. Yeah.
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:28.480]  I'm not saying that's a great joke. I should probably stick to tech, but
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:33.840]  for me, I felt like a good joke and I just, it's pretty good. It's pretty good to delete it,
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:38.160]  but I also don't want to go back. How would you even, how would I even find the tweet ID to
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:44.400]  protect it? But, but I, it well, yeah, because it makes me sick. Every time I see stories though,
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:51.200]  about people who like the, the woman who got the job as the editor of teen Vogue and she's only
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:56.720]  27 or 28. And it's like, she's clearly having, you know, our career was going places. She was
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:02.560]  becoming the new editor in chief at teen Vogue. And somebody found a bunch of tweets. She wrote
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:09.280]  when she was a freshman in college, 19 and they were bad tweets. They were bad tweets, bad tweets.
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:16.800]  She apologized profusely for them, but it wasn't enough. And she wound up losing the job. And it's
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:22.320]  like, you know what, when she wrote those tweets as a 19 year old, she was not thinking of them
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:28.320]  as something that was anything other than ephemeral. You know, that there is something
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:35.200]  weird about Twitter where it feels ephemeral and it is not right by default.
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:39.520]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and even if, even if you're deleting your tweets, I think somewhere
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:46.400]  they're being sucked up, but like for me, I mean, there was my, uh, Ku Klux Klan period of Twitter,
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:51.120]  early Twitter, where I was just supporting Ku Klux Klan stuff. Nonce. No, no. I had,
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:56.880]  uh, thankfully I didn't have a weird period of like using Twitter as a, as a kind of like a
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:03.600]  racist soapbox or anything like that. But like for me, it's more just the weight. Like, like there's,
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:10.080]  there is a rat pack pack rat sort of element to it. And in general, I'm trying to get rid of stuff
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:15.200]  physical or digital in my life. Like I'm just trying to like, like I'm constantly selling
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:22.240]  things. Like I, I, I hate buying new, I like love buying new tools. Like I just got a new printer.
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:26.560]  Um, but I got it for a very specific purpose and like, you know, the, the, the tension of
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:30.400]  buying the thing, getting the thing is now forcing me to like really use it. And I'm like, okay,
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:34.560]  I have to justify the fact that I brought this new object into my life, but I'm constantly
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:40.320]  selling stuff off. Um, you know, that if I, if I don't use it, it's like, it's gone. And
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:47.120]  Japan actually has a really amazing kind of eBay, um, like tool that handles all of the shipping
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:50.080]  and everything is anonymized. So you don't know where it's being shipped to and they don't know
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:55.440]  who you are. And it's wonderful. And like the, you know, they act as like a escrow service. And so
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:02.000]  it's, it's super great. You can just sell high value stuff. Like I don't sell my, um, my old
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:07.440]  Mac books to the Apple store. I put it on the service cause I can get 50, 50% more and they
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:13.600]  sell within a day. Like it's just instant boom sold. And, um, so I'm constantly getting rid of
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:20.480]  stuff physically and I just find digitally as well. Like what, what is the value of me holding
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:24.000]  onto these things? And so what I did before I started doing the tweet delete thing is I just,
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.600]  I downloaded my archive and I have all of my original stuff on my hard drive. And if I really,
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:34.880]  really, really need that, um, it's there. But, uh, I don't know. It just feels like
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:42.480]  having that out in the open brought no value to me. And I even think like there's this argument
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:46.320]  of like, well, what if people like quote your tweets in an article or link to it or embed it?
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:50.400]  It's like, well, whatever. I don't know. Like, is the world going to end if three of my tweets that
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:54.480]  were quoted in some article like aren't, aren't there anymore? Like people figure it out. They'll
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:58.880]  get the context, like, you know, do a screenshot of the tweet if you, if you really want to include
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:05.440]  it in something like, I think there are ways around it and, uh, you know, to, to sort of make
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:10.880]  stuff that you want to reference a little more solid. But the thing that's really surprised me
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:14.720]  is I get emails all the time and messages all the time. Like, Hey, that thing you tweeted two weeks
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:21.200]  ago, where did that go? Like, like, um, which is shocking that people use Twitter or seem to use
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:25.520]  Twitter as this, like as these pointers, like they book, I don't know if they're bookmarking
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:30.720]  the tweets to come back to or what is definitely something I don't do. I, I, you know, if I see a
[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:35.600]  tweet that has something I like, it goes into things. It's like, okay, what's the link. Okay.
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:39.920]  It goes into things. I can set a reminder for me to come back to this in a week. You know,
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:45.840]  it's like, I don't rely on the original tweet object to be the canonical reference for that
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:52.560]  thing that I'm interested in. Um, but anyway, but Google analytics, similar sort of thing. I feel,
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:58.800]  I feel so much lighter getting rid of that crap and plausible is great. I have really enjoyed
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:05.360]  plausible. And the only thing I use analytics for is to see if there's a, um, some kind of incoming
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:10.240]  traffic spike. That means I've been linked somewhere that I just want to know about.
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:14.640]  It's just a way for me to keep track of like, if, if, uh, a big site has sent me
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:19.840]  traffic, that's all I use analytics for. That's it. Uh, yeah. Like if I linked to you, right.
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:28.720]  Oh yeah. I got, I got the, the Gruber, the Gruber led light that goes, I knocked a website offline
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:33.520]  a couple of weeks ago for the first time in a while. And again, I don't think it's because
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:39.360]  the amount of traffic that comes from a link from me is decreased. It's just that server
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:45.040]  infrastructure has gotten more and more Bulletproof and you know, WordPress sites are cashed, have
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:49.920]  caching on by default. And I mean, that was always the nine out of 10 times where if I linked to
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:55.600]  something and the website went down, it was cause it was a default, the old WordPress without
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:42:04.240]  caching. Uh, yeah. Yeah. Uh, yeah. I don't know. Well, and cloud flare today too. I have everything
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:10.560]  I, I have up there is behind cloud flare. So it's just, that's another kind of miracle service.
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:15.920]  Like it's, it's so cheap. I don't understand how it can be so cheap. I really don't. I don't
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:22.800]  either. It's incredible. It's so cheap. And, uh, you know, digital ocean too, like the quality of
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:29.760]  server you get at digital ocean for the price you pay is amazing to me. I love it. I love, I'm a
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:35.040]  huge digital ocean fan. Um, it's just been wonderful working on their, you know, their
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:38.880]  service, their, uh, you know, spinning up their service. I have a digital ocean server that all
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:46.400]  it is, is it's a, it's a wire guard, um, uh, VPN for me. That's it. You know, and it's like,
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:51.920]  it's cheaper, it's cheaper to buy the digital ocean server, have an auto update, do all the
[01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:58.240]  security updates automatically and, uh, have that be my VPN in the U S then it is to pay for
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:04.640]  a big VPN service. And then this way I also know what the server is that is running the VPN.
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:09.040]  It's pretty amazing. All right. Let me take, let me take one last break here and thank our third
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:16.160]  and final sponsor. Our good friends at Mac Weldon. Uh, I am wearing Mac Weldon right now. I know,
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:20.240]  I think it's like the third spot in a row where I've been able to say that. And I'm like looking
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:25.840]  down at this hoodie that I'm wearing and it's yep. Mac Weldon, I've got Mac Weldon stealth
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:32.160]  boxer briefs on underneath my jeans. They make men's basics and everything from socks and
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:38.800]  underwear to workout clothes, outdoor activities, the hoodie, my beloved hoodie that I'm wearing
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:46.800]  right here. Um, it's just a great, great company with all sorts of great clothing, uh, perfect for
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:52.240]  everyday wear to be layered underneath workout gear if that's what you want. And they've got
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:57.280]  sweat pants you can wear outside without feeling like you're wearing sweat pants. I bought a pair
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:01.280]  of sweat pants. John Sir, Cusa was on the show and gave me a hard time for going through the whole
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:07.760]  2020 pandemic without sweat pants. Apparently that's what everybody did. I got a pair of sweat
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:12.000]  pants. I've been wearing them. I'm probably going to buy another pair. I kind of like it.
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.600]  Still feel a little weird leaving the house in them, but a pretty nice for lounge and about
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:21.600]  the house. Nice, nice pockets. I'll tell you what I hate about sweat pants in theory is I don't want
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:25.680]  to like, if I got my phone in my pocket, I don't want it falling out of my pocket because they're
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:31.120]  sweat pants pockets. Mac Weldon, you don't have that problem. Nice deep pockets, very nice,
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:35.200]  secure design and cut to the pockets. Keeps your stuff from falling out when you sit on the couch.
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:43.200]  Like I said, socks, shirts, hoodies, underwear, polos, active shorts. Mac Weldon has it all.
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:48.880]  Great look, great feel. I really love this stuff. I feel like by the time I'm done with this podcast,
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:52.640]  everybody who listens to it, we're all going to be wearing the same Mac Weldon shirts and hoodies.
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:58.720]  They have a great loyalty program. Level one gets you free shipping for life. Once you hit it,
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:04.240]  you just get free shipping. Once you reach level two and that's, you just have to spend 200 bucks.

[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:51.440]  let's talk some tools. I want to know how you make a book. Okay. So what pain. All right. InDesign
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:58.800]  for layout. InDesign for layout. Yeah. I was, I was a quark person too. When I was a university,
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:06.640]  I learned, uh, on quark, this is like 2000, 2001. And, uh, it was, it was really fast.
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:13.440]  It was really good. I think the thing that quark did badly was font rendering. There's something
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:18.000]  about, I remember InDesign when InDesign came out, it just, I know what you're talking about.
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:23.760]  It was the open type support, open type support. That was it. Yes. And that was, that was
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:30.240]  infuriating. It was infuriating that this is like such a fundamental bit of digital typography that
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:34.400]  quark dropped the ball on. And I think that was what pushed me to InDesign. And I remember using
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:38.400]  the InDesign beta and just, and I remember the literatures and all, you know, the other
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:42.640]  open types stuff just working and being like, okay, well, I guess I got to use this thing now.
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:46.800]  I remember it's, I remember an InDesign or ever since we were talking to Dean Allen about it and,
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:52.000]  and it basically, he was like, look, you're going to have a whole laundry list of things you liked
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:57.680]  better about quark than InDesign, but InDesign does open type right. Open type makes the old
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:03.600]  pre-open type postscript fonts look like junk and therefore you need to use InDesign because there's
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:08.400]  too many, there's too many good features in there. And it was a very strange, I don't know if it was
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:14.800]  technical debt. I don't know what happened. The other thing about quark, quark made bad
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:22.000]  design a little too easy. I mean, the, the one thing that quark did that you just could never
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.480]  forgive them. And once you know that designers in the nineties were doing this with everything,
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:31.280]  you can't, you couldn't unsee it, but I guess most of the flyers and stuff people made are,
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:36.880]  are long gone, but you could select a range of text and then just with one little click,
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:43.520]  set it to be like 90% width to make it, you know, like to fake a slightly skinnier font
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:52.080]  or if it like didn't quite fill the space set, set it to 110% or 150%. And so people would like,
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:59.440]  if you wanted like a, like a tall, skinny sans serif, you, it was so trivially easy to just use
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:04.800]  like Helvetica and just make it skinny. But if you know anything about typography, it was,
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:08.960]  you know, you know, it was optically squished and was a crime against typographic.
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:19.520]  So InDesign for layout, what about InDesign for layout? Yeah. InDesign for layout. I tried,
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:24.560]  I looked at affinity publisher and I think affinity publisher, I really like affinity
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:32.000]  as a company. And I think I use affinity photo actually for all of my, I actually don't use it
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:39.360]  for much because I don't do, I use Lightroom for my photo editing and my catalog editing. So I keep
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:46.960]  all of my, my serious photos in Lightroom classic or Lightroom CC is lacking a few features that to
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:52.160]  me make it unusable as a professional. And so I'm still in Lightroom classic. And I think a lot of
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:56.960]  people who are professional photographers are in Lightroom classic. And the fact that it's called
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:02.400]  Lightroom classic is a little bit unnerving because it feels like Adobe wants to get rid
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:08.720]  of this thing. And so I'm in Lightroom classic for organizing my library and for doing photo,
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:17.520]  90% of my photo edits. And I use affinity photo for doing essentially photo resizing and exporting
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:23.520]  in different sizes. I just find it's exported to be really fast. I just find Photoshop to have
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:33.840]  gotten so slow over the last decade. And a lot of it's like if you do the web exporter dialogue,
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:38.640]  it comes up in like loads of web pages. I don't know. It's just all so slow. It's very bad. It's
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:45.200]  very, very bad affinity, super fast, super easy. I love supporting independent software companies.
[01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:48.560]  You buy it once you don't think about it again, yada, yada, yada. And so I tried publisher,
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:55.040]  but it just didn't. The problem is that if you're working with real printers, like big printers,
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:50:00.960]  is that they want InDesign files. For them, it's easy to work with InDesign files. And they may
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:10.320]  want to do things like check is all of your type properly set in K? Or did you accidentally set it
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:15.200]  as an RGB value? And so they want to double check all these things. And so having InDesign makes it
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:19.200]  a little bit easier to interface with these printers out in the world. So that's kind of
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:23.920]  why I'm still in there. I'm not using, honestly, I think InDesign from 20 years ago,
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:29.440]  whatever the feature set was, was enough for me. I don't do anything that InDesign I think
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:39.280]  has added in the last 10 years. So anyway, that's that. And for writing, I use Ulysses to do a lot
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:48.400]  of drafting of essays. And the reason I started using Ulysses was because A, it let me use Dropbox
[01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:54.240]  as my folder. So I like having my files on my local hard drive. And I like that Dropbox then
[01:50:54.240 --> 01:51:00.720]  syncs in the background. And I actually have a NAS now that is pulling down a full Dropbox archive
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:06.720]  onto the NAS. And so I feel like it's backed up there as well. But the reason I like Ulysses was
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:13.440]  a lot of other of those like minimalist text editors back, I don't know, when I started using
[01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:20.800]  it eight years ago, seven years ago, they didn't allow Dropbox, a lot of them were iCloud based,
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:26.240]  or you couldn't, you couldn't, this is a real critical thing is like you'd have you can have
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:30.640]  a folder in Ulysses where you can manually sort the files in the folder. So you don't have to
[01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:36.240]  have them sorted by date or by title. And for me being able to move files around. So treating a
[01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:39.920]  folder like a table of contents was really critical for me. And when you're working on a
[01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:47.680]  book, it's super, super critical. That's like, it's sort of like you letting a touch. It's not a
[01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:54.480]  full outliner. But that's the idea behind real outlining software, where by which I mean, not
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:52:01.360]  like when you're in Apple Notes and just type a dash and you're typing in a thing that looks like
[01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:08.480]  an outline, but an outline where you can take any heading and just drag it up and down to reorganize
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:15.360]  it. Right, exactly. And so you and Ulysses also does a couple of neat things where, like if you
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:20.880]  select a number of files that are next to each other, it like just creates one document with all
[01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:26.000]  that in it. So you can kind of, you can, I mean, you can just feel like you're working, there's a
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:31.760]  there's a flexibility to it. I think that when you're working on a book with chapters, that is
[01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:41.920]  great. And then Ulysses also has super powerful PDF export styling. So like I, you can write
[01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:48.080]  essentially CSS for the PDF exports. And so you can you can do really beautiful typographically
[01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:52.720]  good looking exports in Ulysses. And I love using that to basically put out the drafts,
[01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:57.520]  print out drafts, so I can do I can do checks and stuff on the on the on the pieces. And so there's
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:02.800]  a there's a huge Ulysses kind of element to the the editing process. And then depending on
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:10.320]  the length of the thing or how what stage I'm at, sometimes I'll bring it into Google Docs to work
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:18.560]  with editors. I find actually Google Docs is depth is by far the best shared editing space in terms
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:23.840]  of writing notes in the margins, making suggestions, you know, okaying or rejecting
[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:29.120]  suggestions, having conversations. It's just Google Docs has a lot of issues. And Google Drive
[01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:34.480]  is one of the worst pieces of software. Like I don't understand how Google Drive is so difficult
[01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:41.680]  to use. It's to be beautifully complicated. I can't, I can never find what I'm looking for in
[01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:46.800]  Google Drive. Like there's just some there's some philosophy of engineering that's happened there
[01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:51.600]  that about how it's going to show you what it's going to show you and how it's thinking about
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:56.400]  hierarchies that just doesn't make sense to I think, a normal user and I had this thread on
[01:53:56.400 --> 01:54:02.240]  Twitter that's probably been deleted about Google Drive and like just hundreds of people chiming in
[01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:07.280]  being like, Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. It's so tough to use. But Google Docs, the trick with
[01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:12.080]  using it is to just put links to docs in a text file and don't even touch Google Drive. And so
[01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:16.880]  but Google Docs is it really is. It's a great piece of software. And Google Docs actually
[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:23.120]  does one thing in the fast software best software philosophy that I wish I could do on Mac OS. And
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:29.920]  it drives me crazy. And if anyone listening out there can can program a shortcut, I have looked
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:34.640]  into this and I have not been able to figure out a solution to this problem. But in Google Docs,
[01:54:34.640 --> 01:54:39.440]  if you have a spelling a misspelt word and you curse you have the cursor on the word,
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:45.680]  you can tab into this into the spell correction options and hit enter and then it so you never
[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:49.200]  have to take your fingers off the keyboard. You don't have to use the trackpad. You don't have
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:54.720]  to right click on anything and select, you know, the the corrected word, you can just in line right
[01:54:54.720 --> 01:55:01.680]  there super quickly select the correct spelling. So like things like that. I really love about it.
[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:04.240]  But mainly the collaborative component is the is the
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:08.080]  do you know about the f5 shortcut? This isn't going to solve your problem with misspelling.
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:15.680]  But do you know that an in text edit or any any cocoa app, you can start typing a word and if you
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:24.480]  hit f5, you get auto completion based on the dictionary. So, right, I remapped that keyboard
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:30.160]  shortcut because the f5 is very hard to type. And if you have, you know, you have to turn off
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:36.560]  to get it by default, you have to turn off the magic, you know, keyboard brightness or whatever
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:41.440]  f5 does on your thing. And if you're using a MacBook Pro with a touch bar, you know,
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:49.840]  how you get f5. So I I've remapped it to control return. And so because pinky for control,
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:57.920]  right hand for return, and then it's it's this universal auto complete. But I know but that's I
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:03.680]  I know exactly what you're talking about, though, right? So you've got the insertion point on the
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:10.640]  red underlined word, and you're like, just give me the list. Don't don't don't switch modes. Yeah,
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:17.440]  I've got to go to the trackpad. I've got a right click. I've got it. And the thing is,
[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:21.120]  the hit areas are so small, right? It's like, oh, I've got to select just the right word. It's,
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:26.400]  it's, it's, it's exhausting. It's just weird. And Google anyway, Google Docs has a really nice
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:31.920]  solution for it that I would love how do you invoke it? So you just you hit the tab key?
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:38.080]  Is that what you do? I think so. I'm pretty sure I was testing it the other day. And I think
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:43.200]  there is the it's either you hit the tab or I think it's tab and it just brings you up
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:51.920]  into that into that pop up. And seems to work pretty well. I don't know it. It. It's it's an
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:56.560]  elegant seems like an elegant solution, pretty obvious solution. But I haven't seen any other
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:02.080]  text editor do it. And it kind of drives me nuts. And even the the command, semi colon,
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:06.720]  I know, that's kind of like the universal spellchecker invoker. Even that, you know,
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:10.880]  it's like, you'd think that if you're doing that it would it would move, you know, because it's
[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:15.040]  like, right now I'm doing it in this notes file. And it's selecting the red squiggly underlined
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:19.440]  words, which is great. But you'd think it would select it and then show you here are the here are
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:24.720]  the options, you know, and also giving you the option to please learn the spelling, which is a
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:27.520]  great thing to be able to just do from the keyboard. That that's another one of those
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:31.920]  aspects of Mac OS X, where maybe there's a little bit of cruft in that user interface,
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:38.160]  like the system wide spelling checker is sort of hasn't really I mean, they've updated the style
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:43.280]  of the windows, you know, each time they've revised the style of the windows and the operating,
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:50.960]  you know, the, the interface, but it's like the same basic Hey, it's like a floating panel. And
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:56.560]  everything's that everything's really small, right? Like it's just the fun. Yeah, you know,
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:58:04.400]  and just because they haven't resized anything from 2001 2002 when pixel for pixel that was
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:11.120]  actually a reasonably sized spelling checker panel. I bet it's from Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah.
[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:18.960]  I bet next had that command semicolon. It's such a weird command, right? Command semicolon. I bet
[01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:25.520]  that's from next. It's a holdover. Yeah, anyway, anyway, you know, it's like, people forget that
[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:32.000]  actually next, the text components of next had, essentially, like hyperlinking built, had links
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:36.000]  built in, you know, like that, if you right click on something, I want to make it a link, and say,
[01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:42.240]  you know, that's all from next. That's, that's 30 years old. That's a 30 year old, you know,
[01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:49.840]  I was editing the shared document that we have for this episode of the show. And I was doing it
[01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:54.240]  on my iPad today. And I thought, you know, this is something I should remember and bring it up when
[01:58:54.240 --> 01:59:00.720]  I'm talking to Craig, like it on the Mac, I know how to make something a link, I right click on it,
[01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:06.160]  or go to the Edit menu. And there's edit link. And then you get a thing I know the shortcut,
[01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:12.880]  isn't it Command K, my fingers want it to be Command K, Command K, you can paste in the URL,
[01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:20.560]  and now you have a link. And how do you do that on on iPad OS or iOS? There's there's no way,
[01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:26.800]  you know, there's no standard way across all apps. It's just, I don't know, there's something
[01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:31.040]  sometimes I started thinking about things like that, and how nice it is that it was so
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:39.520]  consistent. It is still so consistent across multiple applications, and that the way you do it
[01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:44.160]  in text edit is the same way you do it in Apple Notes. It's the same way you do it in Apple Mail.
[01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:50.480]  It's it works in a text view in Safari, you know, and that the text view in Safari,
[01:59:50.480 --> 01:59:56.000]  even though it's a web browser, inherits all of these things from cocoa for the spelling checker
[01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:01.200]  and stuff like that, and the right click menu. And that even in Safari, you can have this text field
[02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:07.920]  and get the standard control click menu. I think this point of like, how do you make something a
[02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:14.960]  link is it perfectly embodies the iOS, you know, philosophy, which is that you weren't going to
[02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:19.600]  use this thing when iOS was made, the idea that people be, you know, copying and pasting links
[02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:23.280]  between the wall, there's no there wasn't even copy and paste, but like bringing links between
[02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:28.240]  apps, you know, it's just like that wasn't, that wasn't the use case. So I think it speaks to like,
[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:33.840]  there's a fundamental core of an operating system that gets made at the start. And there's a
[02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:38.720]  fundamental set of decisions, philosophical decisions about how the OS should function.
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:45.520]  And you can't change those over time, for better or for worse. And, you know, like this Mac OS link
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:53.360]  thing is 30 years old from, you know, from next, and iOS just didn't, didn't have that philosophy
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:56.320]  in the beginning. So now, it's like, we're trying to bolt these things on, or Apple's trying to bolt
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:02.160]  these things on, like on iPad OS, and it just feels non native, you know, just another thing
[02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:08.800]  for me, like on, on the iPad, iPad OS, is the keyboard buffer doesn't exist between apps. Do you
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:09.840]  know what I'm talking about?
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:15.760]  Yeah. And it's so like your command tabbing, and you start typing. Yeah. And you think that
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:21.600]  the app, you know, you're going from notes to messages, and you just start typing,
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:25.440]  and then you've lost like the first two words, because they just didn't show up.
[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:27.440]  Exactly.
[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:27.760]  I know.
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:33.680]  That it's those sorts of things. It's just like, okay, this wasn't made for these sorts
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:38.800]  of interactions. That's what it says to me. And you just have to, you have to accept that. It's
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:43.760]  not going to, I don't think it's ever going to change. iPad OS will not get a keyboard buffer
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:44.400]  anytime soon.
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:51.440]  They did fix a bug that was driving me nuts about two years ago, where the spotlight search didn't
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:57.120]  it like your first couple of characters in a spotlight search, just always got lost for me,
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:02.000]  I do command space, start typing, and it doesn't matter how many times I got burned by it, I would
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:07.120]  do it again. Because whenever I'm thinking, oh, I should search spotlight for that. I've already
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:12.320]  started typing the query before I even remembered, oh, this is going to eat my first few characters.
[02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:17.520]  And I brought it up to somebody at Apple, I filed a radar, I had a thing. And then they were like,
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:21.520]  they took a look at it. And they were like, huh, you're right. Yeah, that does that for me, too.
[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:28.160]  Huh. And then it got it got fixed in like a point upgrade to, you know, like, iPad OS 12.7. But it's
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:32.880]  like, how did that happen? How did how did more people inside Apple not not not be driven by this?
[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:40.640]  Well, well, and also, here's another aspect of that. Why are those first characters so
[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:48.000]  important for search? That, that always it always shocks me how if you if you miss that first
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:52.080]  character, and this happens when you're on like the little keyboard or something on an iPhone,
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:56.800]  spotlight often will not be able to find like if you're trying to open mail and you type AIL,
[02:02:56.800 --> 02:03:05.520]  it doesn't find mail or if I search for egg mod, instead of I missed the CR. And it's like,
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:12.560]  how does that not find you anyway? It should it to me, there's a there's a kind of brokenness
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:19.680]  with search in general that over emphasizes that first character that I don't know to me that it
[02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:28.240]  feels like it should be fixed. I feel like Alford on, you know, on the Mac. On Mac, maybe is a
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:31.440]  little is a little more forgiving. There's, I mean, it's just fuzzy search. There's like,
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:36.240]  there's algorithms right out there that are very easy to just bolt on to any search field. And you
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:41.600]  get that that capability to get really accurate, fuzzy search that's not contingent on that those
[02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:46.720]  first couple of characters. Like I'm fzf. Do you know that that little application for the term?
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:55.040]  I don't think so fzf. No, it's this crazy. It's this crazy search tool that allows you to basically
[02:03:55.040 --> 02:04:03.040]  do like infinite, infinitely deep searches on your computer based on, you know, super fuzzy
[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:09.520]  search terms. So you can do CD, and you can type, like test and then you do you invoke it by by,
[02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:14.960]  I think, doing two asterisks and then hitting enter. And then it turns it into an fzf search.
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:19.600]  And basically it auto completes, you know, in all of the sub directories, anything that has the
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:23.920]  word test in it, and then you can just you can select the directory you want to go to. But like,
[02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:28.560]  you don't have to you can anyway, you can you can type a series of words that you know, will kind of
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:34.800]  get you six directories deep to the place you want to go. And then invoke fzf. Anyway, it's a very
[02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:40.160]  fast way to move. And it just it speaks to the power of like, if you know how to use and expect
[02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:45.280]  fuzzy search to work properly. It's so empowering. It's like truly bicycle for the minds. It's like
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:50.240]  you've just amplified your ability to kind of traverse directories or move through your OS,
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:56.560]  you know, five times faster. It's just one of those kind of like really cool magic tools. But
[02:04:57.680 --> 02:05:02.720]  but yeah, it would be nice if we could correct words from the keyboard. That's all I'm saying.
[02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:09.600]  All right, last but not least. So is that everything for book production? Right? You've
[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:16.080]  got InDesign for design. You've got you've got Ulysses for writing Lightroom, and maybe some
[02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:27.760]  Affinity for photo editing. Yeah, that's, that's, that's the crux of it. And yeah, I don't I've
[02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:33.360]  tried to use things like Scrivener. And I just find, I just find it's an app that doesn't work
[02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:37.280]  the way I want to work. It's a little, little bit too, too onerous, a little bit too finicky.
[02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:44.080]  Yeah, I think that's, that's, that's the core. So Kisa by Kisa, am I pronouncing it right? Because
[02:05:44.080 --> 02:05:52.160]  I probably would have said yeah, perfect. I guess Kisa by Kisa. Your first run was
[02:05:55.280 --> 02:06:04.800]  as we head down the homestretch here, you decided to do 1000 copies. And it sold out in like a day.
[02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:08.800]  Like two, basically like two days.
[02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:15.920]  It and, you know, and again, I don't think it's not self effacing. It's not fake modesty. It
[02:06:15.920 --> 02:06:21.760]  just sounds like that's a lot of copies of a $95 book to sell that quickly. Yeah.
[02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:28.560]  It's insane. It's insane. That's why I only made 1000. I thought, I thought, well,
[02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:32.560]  there's no way I'm gonna sell 1000 of these my expectation, like, and I'm truly I'm not like,
[02:06:32.560 --> 02:06:37.920]  you know, feigning false modesty here, like my expectation was, I'll make 1000 of these,
[02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:41.440]  and then it'll take three years to sell them all. That was what I expected.
[02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:46.960]  Keep them in a warehouse as they slowly go out. It This is a hard thing to talk about on a podcast.
[02:06:46.960 --> 02:06:54.960]  It is a lovely book. How what is the name of this cover style? Because it is,
[02:06:55.840 --> 02:07:01.760]  it looks like a hardbound book. It kind of feels like a hardbound book. But it actually has a
[02:07:01.760 --> 02:07:05.840]  little bit of flex to it that a true cardboard hardbound book doesn't have.
[02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:16.160]  Yeah, I mean, flex a bind is, is, is essentially, I think, what it's mainly called flex, flex
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:21.520]  binding, flex bound, but it's all it is, you're just taking the, the boards of a hardcover book
[02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:28.000]  that are normally thicker, and you're just sort of, you know, choosing thinner boards that aren't
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:33.680]  the you know, it's it's kind of between a paperback and a hardcover. But I think it's like,
[02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:36.720]  I think we ended up at like point seven millimeters or something like that was the final
[02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:42.400]  we did a bunch of tests to find one that had the right feel. And then what happens is when you
[02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:50.400]  when you cover them in cloth, it gives it this extra durability. So the thing that drives me nuts
[02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:54.240]  about hardcover books is just they feel a little bit violent in the hand because it's like this is
[02:07:54.240 --> 02:07:58.720]  so hard and like either corners are kind of digging into your into your into your palm or
[02:07:58.720 --> 02:08:06.320]  whatever. And I really love, you know, the book of the field of paperbacks. But I understand that
[02:08:07.120 --> 02:08:11.440]  the perception of a paperback as being a cheaper thing is real. And for you know, for good reason,
[02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:15.040]  because they do, they don't last as long, the bindings a little bit different. But like,
[02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:21.040]  on this book, we're doing a hardcover binding. And we're doing, you know, hardcover style cloth
[02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:29.120]  wrap on the covers. But we're using, you know, boards that are, are closer to paperback boards.
[02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:32.240]  But you know, what you end up with is this, what I feel like is like the perfect,
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:38.720]  the perfect match of tactility and protection. So the book is very protected, it's not going to get
[02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:43.760]  damaged, really, I mean, you can scuff up the cloth or whatever, but it's not going to rip
[02:08:43.760 --> 02:08:50.320]  on you like a paperback would. And yet, when you hold it, the hope is that it feels like
[02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:53.920]  intimate and kind of nice to hold. It's just comfortable, you know, and pleasurable to have
[02:08:53.920 --> 02:09:00.640]  in the hand. And I actually saw this binding for the first time 20 years ago, on this, this book
[02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:07.040]  called Rome City Secrets, that was published as a little guide, this thick little guide to Rome.
[02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:11.040]  And it used the same kind of binding. And I've just always been spellbound. But I just thought,
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:15.840]  Oh, this is it. This is the this is the most amazing binding. I love this. And I've been
[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:21.440]  trying to use it for a while. And finally, with this book, I had enough latitude of being able
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:27.360]  to do what I wanted to do and run tests. And we were able to kind of dial this into a place that
[02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:32.320]  I think feels really, feels really good. So yeah, that's part and, and some people have written in
[02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:36.960]  and been like, you know, I thought this was a hardcover book, you know, something I think a
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:42.480]  couple people have been upset, because they thought they expected a hardcover because they
[02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:46.560]  didn't like, Oh, I didn't realize this was a paperback. You know, why is it $95? Well,
[02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:53.760]  literally, the only thing different between this and, and, and a quote unquote, real hardcover is
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:10:00.400]  like, about half a millimeter of board, that's about it. Otherwise, this is this is definitely
[02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:05.280]  trust me, the costs of producing this thing are hardcover costs. And the durability of this thing
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:09.840]  is going to be hardcover durability. So don't worry about it. But people, so the first edition
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:17.200]  sold out 1000 copies now, though people can still buy the second edition. Is that what you're
[02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:23.440]  calling it? Second? Second edition? Yeah, yeah. Because the first edition is stamped, numbered,
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:30.800]  and signed. And so that was what made it limited. And the second edition is also limited. We did 1200
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:38.240]  copies. And the second edition, I think there's about 200 left. And it's not, it's not stamped
[02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:46.480]  or signed. So it's not editioned. I've got I've got copied 200 on the button. Not 199. Nice. Not
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:53.600]  201. Copy 200. Boom. There you go. I gotta I gotta, you must have a bunch of Taschen books,
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:11:01.520]  right? They're just the best. Taschen is this company that makes the world's greatest coffee
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:07.440]  table books. And some of them are insanely expensive. And I've got a couple of the Kubrick
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:15.040]  ones. And my 2001, I got copied 999, which I thought was, I don't know. I don't know,
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:18.800]  I'm not I'm only one of those guys who, you know, there's all sorts of numbers that you can read
[02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:22.720]  into it. I don't want to be one of these, you know, it means something, but I don't know,
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:30.080]  I thought that was pretty cool. So the other recent project project you've had is a short
[02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:34.000]  film. Is this the first short film you've done since you've been doing special projects?
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:39.120]  Yeah, well, it's the first short film I've ever done ever since before.
[02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:47.280]  It's so good. It makes me sick, Craig. I so how much how much of the work did you do? So the
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:54.160]  it's on YouTube. It is. I don't have the note in front of me. What's the title?
[02:11:54.160 --> 02:12:01.440]  Pizza toast and coffee, which is the same subject as Kisa by Kisa that you've, you know,
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:08.480]  gone on these extended journeys in Japan to experience pizza toast, which really does look
[02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:18.400]  delicious. I it really does. It looks so good. And coffee. And it's like, I don't know what
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:23.440]  more do you need for sustenance. But this this short film, I'm not just saying it because you're
[02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:30.080]  on the show and you're a pal. It is beautiful. But did you do all of it yourself? I mean, did you
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:36.800]  you shot it? You lit it? It is just and it's just it all just takes place on a rainy, like,
[02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:45.680]  mid morning, it looks like. Yeah, yeah, I had to so so that a little bit of background on it is
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:51.920]  one of one of the things I've kind of codified, I guess, like when I was writing up the year in
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:59.520]  review in January this year, was that is that I all of the work I do is essentially to make books.
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:04.640]  So everything is pointing towards books. And every project sub project I do has to be either in
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:11.760]  support of the books or adding some other element to the book or amplifying the book. And so like,
[02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:20.240]  I just find for me that that is that is the most meaningful and simplest way to organize all of my
[02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:25.840]  creative work. Everything is aiming towards producing books. And so all of the walks I was
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:33.680]  doing and I'm still doing these idea for listeners who don't know, I spend about two to six months
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:38.720]  out of the year walking across Japan. I'm about to go off on another big walk in May, actually,
[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:45.600]  it'll be another six or 700 kilometers. I just did one in November that was 700 kilometers. And so
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:52.000]  from these walks, I'm producing books and Kisa by Kisa was kind of the first book from these walks.
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:58.400]  And so I also last year, because of by dint of pandemic, I just started getting more into video,
[02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:03.280]  doing the live streams and playing with cameras and thinking about video just because we couldn't
[02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:08.880]  go anywhere. And so that just made me really, you know, look at the video world once again,
[02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:14.480]  which I hadn't taken a peek at in a long time, and realize like the true advancements in
[02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:20.240]  photography right now are in videography. Like it's a Renaissance moment for anyone who wants
[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:26.800]  to do film. It's crazy how amazing and how quickly consumer pro cameras are advancing.
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:32.720]  And so it was sort of a confluence of all these things of like, going to these Kisa,
[02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:39.440]  these Kisa Ten, these Kisa is a Japanese style, old cafe. These are cafes that were mainly started
[02:14:39.440 --> 02:14:45.440]  in say the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s. And they're mainly run by people who are just about to retire. And so
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:51.040]  they're all kind of just about to disappear. The numbers are dropping precipitously. So I would in
[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:55.440]  these walks across Japan, I you know, the one organizing principle anywhere you go in the
[02:14:55.440 --> 02:15:00.880]  country, it may they may be to have different foods or do you know, a local specialty or,
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:06.480]  or whatever. But the one thing that is consistent is the presence of Kisa and barbershops. You got
[02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:12.000]  those everywhere. Lots of barbershops, lots of Kisa. And, and so I would just start going to
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:18.240]  these Kisa on these walks, I'd see them and just the stories and they to me felt like they embodied
[02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:25.440]  really this cultural touch stone that was easy to overlook as a as a Japanese person,
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:29.360]  because you just kind of, you see them as inevitable. And also it's kind of throw away
[02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:34.400]  things out, whatever, it's a Kisa. But really, they're they're sort of community centers,
[02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:40.240]  a lot of Japan is depopulating in the countryside. And so the Kisa are these de facto community
[02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:43.760]  centers. And so you go to them, and they're just full of these octogenarians. And they're all
[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:47.680]  like, kind of, you know, chatting and farmers catching up and stuff like that. And so, to me,
[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:52.720]  they became these really interesting and important cultural hubs. And pizza toast just happens to be
[02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:57.280]  kind of the food that they're that's one of their staples. And the reason why it's a staple is
[02:15:57.280 --> 02:16:02.160]  because a lot of these are post-war institutions. They didn't have full kitchens. And so to make
[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:07.280]  pizza toast, all you need is a little toaster oven. And so it's a it's an easy to make food
[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:13.920]  that's kind of fun and sort of riffs off of, you know, Western food, but can be done, you know,
[02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:19.120]  very easily, you know, with with next to nothing in terms of ingredients. And so that's sort of
[02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:23.520]  the the kind of the history there of pizza toast in the context of Japanese society.
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:32.800]  And so this, I'd done this book on Kisa Ten, on Kisa, and I'd been doing all this video work.
[02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:38.400]  And when I when I put up my, my Craig starter, because when I launched that Kisa book, I kind of,
[02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:44.640]  I was looking at Kickstarter, and I realized, like, the value that Kickstarter provided for
[02:16:44.640 --> 02:16:48.960]  the cut they took, I just kind of didn't exist there for me anymore. I have my audience,
[02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:53.760]  I didn't feel like Kickstarter was going to drive more audience to buy the thing. So I was looking
[02:16:53.760 --> 02:17:00.000]  at Shopify. And I realized I could basically clone Kickstarter on Shopify using templates.
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:04.320]  And I spent a couple of weeks and I just made my own Kickstarter. And I was able to, you know,
[02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:09.360]  the benefit is you can design it all in any way you want Kickstarter, you're stuck with
[02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:14.240]  their templates, I could make my tiers however I wanted. One big benefit is I could offer discount
[02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:17.920]  codes, which Kickstarter doesn't let you do, you can't offer discount codes to anyone. And so
[02:17:18.800 --> 02:17:22.640]  all of these kind of the you can offer do you can offer discount here to your members.
[02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:28.720]  That's which is exactly what I did. My goal with the membership program is to return
[02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:33.920]  the full membership in discounts every year to every member, at least like if you if you
[02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:38.160]  pay 100 bucks from membership, and you are interested in my work, and you want to buy
[02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:43.920]  my books or whatever, you will get that $100 back absolutely within the year through if you choose
[02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:49.200]  to take care of the take, take advantage of the discounts that I offer. So members got $50 off
[02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:55.120]  on the book. I feel like that's a pretty, pretty powerful incentive. So the membership there to
[02:17:55.120 --> 02:18:00.960]  me feels like basically, it's everyone's making an investment. It's like micro seed capital,
[02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:04.400]  for me to be able to do these projects. And then once I can get the project done, I want to return
[02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:10.880]  that capital. Plus, you know, they get the the hopefully psychically positive return of like
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:15.040]  this new piece of culture being in the world. So it's kind of a way of amplifying that quote unquote
[02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:18.800]  seed capital. But when I was when I was making, you know, when you run a Kickstarter or
[02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:23.440]  craigstarter, you know, you make these like goals, you're like, well, man, if we sell 500 books,
[02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:29.280]  I'll do this. And one of the goals I made was, if we sold 750 books, during the pre sale
[02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:36.960]  campaign, I would make a pizza toast YouTube show. And I was like, I just I was like, I'm
[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:41.840]  definitely not going to sell 750 books. And so I'm definitely not gonna have to make a pizza toast
[02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:49.440]  YouTube show. And sure enough, we sold 750 books in a day. So that made me go, okay, all right,
[02:18:49.440 --> 02:18:53.600]  let me look at this video world again. And I started getting into cameras to document
[02:18:53.600 --> 02:19:01.040]  the production process of the book. And, you know, just a few things led to another and I just
[02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:07.600]  thought, okay, for this pizza toast show, quote unquote pizza show, why don't I do a vignette,
[02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:15.040]  a little profile of one of the cafes that I went to. And, you know, it can be this this kind of
[02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:20.640]  anthropological archetype, our archive of this thing that is going to disappear, this cafe that
[02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:27.200]  I shot will be gone in 10 years. I'm almost 100% certain it doesn't have 10 years left in it.
[02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:37.120]  And so to kind of have 4k archival quality video of this moment, I felt like that that was a really
[02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:43.040]  nice bonus thing to the book, you know, and it kind of points back to the book and the book
[02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:50.160]  points to it. And you talk about making a short film like this as being book-like in concept,
[02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:54.960]  because it has a beginning and an end, right? Here's the thing, you can hold it, here's the
[02:19:54.960 --> 02:20:00.240]  whole thing. You can just hit play, start to finish, it gets to the end, and you're done.
[02:20:00.240 --> 02:20:07.440]  You've enjoyed the movie. That's the one thing that to me is a little weird. It's a little
[02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:17.120]  incongruous to see it on YouTube, where YouTube is this. And I'm more pro YouTube. I mean,
[02:20:17.120 --> 02:20:24.560]  I've started putting my live talk shows on YouTube. I mean, I'm never going to be a YouTuber.
[02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:29.280]  But the thing that I find so unsettling, and I feel like you and I have sort of touched on this,
[02:20:29.280 --> 02:20:38.240]  but that the endless scroll has a psychological weight that I don't, I think we're starting,
[02:20:38.240 --> 02:20:43.680]  we collectively are starting to come to grips with. And I think that that might be one of the
[02:20:43.680 --> 02:20:49.200]  things that's driving people back to things like newsletters and subscription sites. And I can
[02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:56.480]  subscribe to Mattie Iglesias' Slow, Boring, and a new one comes in, and I can hit the space bar
[02:20:56.480 --> 02:21:03.360]  a couple times to read it, and then I get to the bottom, and it's done. And then I'm caught up.
[02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:11.120]  You can catch up on Daring Fireball. When you just start looking for new posts, scroll until you hit
[02:21:11.120 --> 02:21:15.600]  one that you remember seeing before, and then you know you're caught up. And you can close the tab
[02:21:15.600 --> 02:21:20.960]  and come back tomorrow or the next day, and there'll be new posts waiting for you.
[02:21:20.960 --> 02:21:30.480]  So I think that the endless scroll of Twitter and Instagram and YouTube has a psychological weight,
[02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:38.560]  and your little movie stands so athwart of that, right? It's effectively a silent film. I mean,
[02:21:39.520 --> 02:21:46.400]  the sound effects of rain hitting the windows and, you know
[02:21:46.400 --> 02:21:52.960]  Toast flopping. There's a flop of toast. Pour over coffee being brewed.
[02:21:54.400 --> 02:22:02.000]  I'm a big pour-over man myself. Is that the most popular thing in Japan?
[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:09.840]  Yeah, it's a pretty classic pour-over. The old cafes have been doing pour-over,
[02:22:09.840 --> 02:22:16.880]  usually often with cloth drips, cloth nets. Pour-over, and then there's also this siphon
[02:22:16.880 --> 02:22:22.240]  method. Do you know this thing where it looks like a chemistry set, and it's got two bulbs,
[02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:26.880]  and the water kind of burbles up? Japan's been doing that for a very, very long time.
[02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:32.480]  But it is. It's just a contemplative little vignette, and it just is so
[02:22:32.480 --> 02:22:40.880]  In some ways, it is literally a very quiet little movie, but it's different
[02:22:40.880 --> 02:22:47.440]  from the standard fare of YouTube. I found it very striking.
[02:22:48.720 --> 02:22:53.680]  Well, believe me, if I could not have it on YouTube, I would prefer to put it somewhere else.
[02:22:53.680 --> 02:23:00.240]  I thought about this, and I looked around, and the reality is that if you want to host 4K video
[02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:06.960]  somewhere, it's tough to do. And I just don't really like Vimeo. I just find Vimeo, the
[02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:14.560]  interface isn't that good, the algorithms aren't as good. YouTube, for all of its flaws, it has
[02:23:14.560 --> 02:23:22.560]  the best scaling algorithms, the best delivery algorithms, the best in-the-moment resizing,
[02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:29.360]  rescaling algorithms. So it's very bandwidth-aware and friendly. It goes from really crappy
[02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:34.240]  connections to fiber connections, and it kind of handles it all flawlessly. All of
[02:23:34.240 --> 02:23:42.720]  that I think is really important, and I don't see that present in any other consumer video
[02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:48.800]  platform that can host a 4K video. Also, I looked at the cost of doing it on my own,
[02:23:49.360 --> 02:23:56.000]  and it's crazy. It's so expensive. That thing I uploaded is a couple gigs. That's
[02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:03.360]  like a two or three gig video. Last I looked, it had like 15,000 views or whatever. If you
[02:24:03.360 --> 02:24:10.240]  have 15,000 people download two gigs off your server, it's going to hammer you. I looked at
[02:24:10.240 --> 02:24:14.640]  Cloudflare video hosting, I looked at all sorts of things, and just the economics of it were crazy.
[02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:18.400]  It's hard to understand how Google makes it work with YouTube, to be honest.
[02:24:20.080 --> 02:24:25.440]  It's another one of those things that we've wound up with where there's one and only one YouTube,
[02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:30.560]  and there's nothing else that's even vaguely like YouTube. When it works, it is the most
[02:24:30.560 --> 02:24:38.000]  amazing thing. I forget what. I just was searching for a commercial the other day.
[02:24:39.200 --> 02:24:46.480]  Oh, the Casio G-Shock watch, because there's a rumor that Apple's going to make a rubbery,
[02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:53.280]  rugged version of Apple Watch, and I wanted to look up the hockey puck version of the initial
[02:24:53.280 --> 02:24:59.200]  Casio. Of course, they had it. Of course, they did. It was the first thing that came up. I just
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:04.480]  took a guess at the year. I was like, Casio 1983 G-Shock ad, first hit. There it was.
[02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:06.880]  Wow. Yeah. It's amazing.
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:14.160]  That is amazing when you think about it. Because in 1983, that ad was on TV every day,
[02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:19.680]  and I saw it every day. Then by 1993, I certainly remembered it, but I would have had
[02:25:19.680 --> 02:25:27.520]  0% chance of finding a copy of it. 0.00. I wouldn't even know where to go. What? Call the
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:34.640]  Casio US headquarters and see if they'll send me a copy on VHS of an ad from 10 years ago?
[02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:36.960]  You couldn't do it.
[02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:44.000]  Right. Yeah. It is weird. It's an incredible archive. It really is.
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:52.240]  I'd love to know the economics on it, like what their expenses are for all of that bandwidth,
[02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:57.440]  what they really are. But I think just the advertising, they make a lot of money
[02:25:57.440 --> 02:26:05.360]  advertising on YouTube. My goal is if I have to get to 4,000 hours viewed on my channel
[02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:11.760]  in public videos, and then I can turn off all advertising. Because I think right now,
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:18.080]  Google can still automatically put an ad on my stuff, even without me being able to say yes or
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:23.520]  no. I have not turned on monetization for any of my videos. But if you cross a threshold,
[02:26:23.520 --> 02:26:30.320]  you're allowed to say, never, ever, ever put an ad on my stuff. I'm hoping that we get close to
[02:26:30.320 --> 02:26:36.240]  it with this video so I can turn off all the ads. It's a little weird that you have to do it that
[02:26:36.240 --> 02:26:42.560]  way. But I guess it's sort of an anti-fraud type thing, to keep a spammer from just creating an
[02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:48.880]  endless series of new channels just to keep putting their ads on. But what exactly their
[02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:55.280]  game would be to not have ads, I'm not quite sure. But I'm sure that YouTube has run into
[02:26:55.280 --> 02:27:03.600]  every single imaginable form of fraud. But no, but back to your question about the production
[02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:10.720]  of the video. It was just me, I brought a backpack with 20 kilograms of photo equipment in it, a few
[02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:19.760]  lenses, a light, a tripod, and that was it. The hardest part was convincing the guy in the video
[02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:26.960]  to let me shoot him. These old Kisa guys, they can't see any of the value in what they're doing.
[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:34.480]  They can't imagine why anyone would want to watch them do this. And I think an element of him was,
[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:40.080]  is this guy making fun of me? You know, there's kind of this like, is this really, is he serious?
[02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:46.640]  Is he not taking the piss? And, you know, it was like, it was convincing Yamane-san. It was like,
[02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:54.400]  look, I know this is weird, but actually you make really beautiful kind of, you know, strangely
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:28:01.920]  interesting pizza toast. What's the deal with the way he slices the crust? Yeah, he's so he
[02:28:01.920 --> 02:28:07.520]  learned that he's been doing the cafe for 45 years. And for the first two years before he
[02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:12.240]  opened, he worked at this hotel in Yokohama. And I guess one of the guys at the hotel in Yokohama
[02:28:12.240 --> 02:28:17.920]  who ran this fancy cafe would cut the toast in that way a little bit. So what he's doing, he's
[02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:26.320]  scoring it, and he scores two sides of the crust down like 80%. And then he cuts the rest of it,
[02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:30.800]  he scores the rest of it so that when it comes out of the toaster, he's able to evenly split it
[02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:36.640]  into three fingers, essentially. And then the reason why he cuts the crust down is that he has
[02:28:36.640 --> 02:28:42.960]  customers who don't like crust. And so if the crust is cut almost off, but not entirely, you can
[02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:48.240]  peel it off if you don't like it. But if you want to keep it, because it's been separated from the
[02:28:48.240 --> 02:28:55.840]  body of the bread, it actually collects an extra char. So it creates this like nice mouthfeel,
[02:28:55.840 --> 02:29:00.960]  and you get this like crunch from this crust that you wouldn't otherwise get. So that's the
[02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:06.480]  cutting philosophy. It's a lovely, lovely movie. I know we have to wrap it up. But the other thing
[02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:12.080]  we were talking about, we've slagged on some of Apple's software, but you were talking about
[02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:18.000]  getting to know Final Cut Pro and talking that you found it to be a revelation in terms of being
[02:29:19.920 --> 02:29:27.440]  good software. Oh, it's incredible. Well, have we slacked? I feel like we've said we've been
[02:29:27.440 --> 02:29:34.960]  very laudatory of Mac OS. And we've said the old 2016 MacBook Pros are horrible, which I think
[02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:40.480]  anyone would would agree with that. And that iOS is just not, it's not a, you know, it's the bones,
[02:29:40.480 --> 02:29:46.560]  the DNA of iOS is not to be super fluid, you know, to have that kind of that fluency. I think that's
[02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:57.840]  a fair criticism. But Final Cut Pro X is amazing. I love it. I'm entranced. It's some of the best
[02:29:57.840 --> 02:30:03.840]  software they've ever used. They got rid of the X. It's just Final Cut Pro now. When do they get
[02:30:03.840 --> 02:30:06.640]  rid of the X? I thought the X was pretty recent. I think they got rid of it because they got rid of
[02:30:06.640 --> 02:30:14.720]  the X in Mac OS X, too. I don't know. Maybe. Oh. Oh, wow. But I don't use it because I don't,
[02:30:14.720 --> 02:30:20.480]  I haven't made a video. But when I did, I mean, I've made like, you know, I have like my little
[02:30:20.480 --> 02:30:25.040]  goofy video where I show people how to take AirPods out of a out of a case the right way.
[02:30:26.560 --> 02:30:34.000]  Even as a total punter, for lack of a better word, you could see that this is this is a great Mac
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:41.520]  app. Like it's not just a video editor. It is. It is the video editor that the Mac deserves.
[02:30:41.520 --> 02:30:48.480]  And I guess it's polarizing in some ways, because some people, you know, if you don't like that Mac
[02:30:48.480 --> 02:30:53.520]  likeness of it, you're not going to like it. It's, you know, it's not Adobe Premiere.
[02:30:55.440 --> 02:31:01.760]  But it also makes me wonder what and when Apple decides to make, you know, their Pro Tools
[02:31:01.760 --> 02:31:05.920]  group is such an interesting group, you know, like logic is still a huge deal.
[02:31:06.960 --> 02:31:14.560]  But then they got rid of aperture. Like what the thinking is there is very strange to me. And as
[02:31:14.560 --> 02:31:19.520]  Adobe moves Lightroom in this way that you mentioned before, where they seem to be pushing
[02:31:19.520 --> 02:31:26.640]  people towards the cloud version of Lightroom and away from the classic one, which is more of a Mac
[02:31:26.640 --> 02:31:34.640]  style way of working, not in the cloud, but here, I want it on my Mac. That aperture decision just
[02:31:34.640 --> 02:31:42.640]  stands out to me as very hard to explain. Yeah, well, I mean, I think I think it was,
[02:31:43.440 --> 02:31:47.040]  there's probably a moment in Apple where they're like, we're going all in on photos, we're going
[02:31:47.040 --> 02:31:52.800]  to we're going from iPhotos to photos, we're going to make photos super powerful. We want everyone to
[02:31:52.800 --> 02:31:56.960]  be you know, we just want this to be the place that you put all of your, you know, pro or
[02:31:56.960 --> 02:32:02.160]  amateur, whatever. It all goes in here. And I think that was just a flawed philosophy.
[02:32:04.080 --> 02:32:09.120]  Anyway, thank you so much for your time. So let's tell people where they can find out more stuff. So
[02:32:09.120 --> 02:32:14.400]  we'll put a link to copious show notes. This is great. The show you've you've done most of the
[02:32:14.400 --> 02:32:20.640]  work for me. But we will link. Well, we didn't we didn't talk about most we did. We did pretty
[02:32:20.640 --> 02:32:25.200]  good. This is actually for me, this is this is probably about as close as I ever stick to show
[02:32:25.200 --> 02:32:34.800]  notes. I promise to put a link to the to the movie on YouTube. Your website for special projects is
[02:32:34.800 --> 02:32:42.160]  just at Craig mod.com. And your tweets where people can hurry up and read them before you
[02:32:42.160 --> 02:32:49.600]  delete them are on twitter.com slash at Craig mod. No app just Craig. Oh, just guess right. You don't
[02:32:49.600 --> 02:32:58.720]  put the ad in on Twitter. Anyway, I will also thank our sponsors for this episode. We had flat
[02:32:58.720 --> 02:33:04.800]  file where you can go and get your spreadsheets imported. We have Squarespace, the all in one web
[02:33:04.800 --> 02:33:11.520]  hosting solution, and Mack Weldon, where you can buy fresh underwear, socks, hoodies, and more.
[02:33:11.520 --> 02:33:20.400]  Anything else you wanted to to to mention, Craig, before we part ways? No, just you know, the best
[02:33:20.400 --> 02:33:26.640]  the best. The best way to if you're like, Oh, I mean, I'm interested in this guy's stuff. And
[02:33:26.640 --> 02:33:31.680]  I want to kind of support his stuff. But I don't want to be a member. The best thing to do is like,
[02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:36.720]  check out the books. I'm just I just feel like I'm really, I'm really proud of the book work. So
[02:33:36.720 --> 02:33:42.720]  I'd say go there and investigate that. But if you do become a member, you get a big discount.
[02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:49.120]  Yeah. Well, let me say this about the book. And if you went to the website, and you looked at
[02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:55.520]  your website pages for the book, and you're thinking, Oh, I think I know what that book
[02:33:55.520 --> 02:34:02.720]  would be like, the book is exactly like that. You know, there's just something interesting. I don't
[02:34:02.720 --> 02:34:09.680]  know how better to say it. It it the book has the exact vibe that I expected it to have. And it's
[02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:16.800]  it's truly lovely. Great. Well, thank you, man. typographically gorgeous as well. But of course,
[02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:19.920]  Thank you. I had I had Frank Camaro's help on that. Oh, man, that guy.
[02:34:21.440 --> 02:34:25.040]  I had this is the thing is like also independently producing this book.
[02:34:27.120 --> 02:34:30.960]  You know, I talked to a bunch of agents and publishers in New York about doing
[02:34:30.960 --> 02:34:36.240]  a similar kind of book. But they were all, you need to do something a little more normal first.
[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:41.280]  And then you can do kind of this, because the book is a little experimental. But, you know,
[02:34:41.280 --> 02:34:45.840]  doing it on my own, one of the one of the issues with quote unquote, so called vanity publishing is
[02:34:45.840 --> 02:34:50.240]  that you often don't get to work with these like high level amazing people that you can sometimes
[02:34:50.240 --> 02:34:56.720]  work with if you go to a big publisher. But I've built up such a such a great group of friends who
[02:34:56.720 --> 02:35:05.840]  talented beyond me and 100 x group of friends that I'm able to call on that, you know, the typography
[02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:11.840]  we did big sweeps with Frank Camaro, Rob game Pietro chimed in gave me some feedback, I was
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:17.360]  able to work with gray 318, one of the best cover designers in the world to do a bunch of feedback
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:22.160]  on the production of the book. And then the editors I worked with are two of the best editors,
[02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:27.520]  you know, that I know, you know, and that in in their industry, and they're in their in their,
[02:35:27.520 --> 02:35:32.240]  their worlds, they're top of the top. So I think that's also kind of a weird quirk is that I don't
[02:35:32.240 --> 02:35:39.200]  think I could have made. I'm so satisfied with where this book landed that I couldn't have landed
[02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:44.320]  in a better place in any other way. So like, that's, that's the end. I don't say that lately.
[02:35:44.320 --> 02:35:46.880]  John Greenewald Well, you should be very proud. It is it is a
[02:35:46.880 --> 02:35:50.160]  it is a wonderful book. All right, Craig. Thanks for being on the show.
[02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:50.640]  Craig
[02:35:50.640 --> 02:36:20.240]  Boom. Thanks, john.
