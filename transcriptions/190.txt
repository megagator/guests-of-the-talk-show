[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Lots to talk about. What do you want to start with?
[00:02.000 --> 00:07.000]  Do you want to start with this Microsoft Build keynote?
[00:06.000 --> 00:11.000]  Yeah, it was interesting. Did you watch it?
[00:08.000 --> 00:13.000]  No, I didn't watch it.
[00:10.000 --> 00:15.000]  I was going to, but I ran out of time.
[00:13.000 --> 00:18.000]  Yeah, sorry. I failed to bail you out there.
[00:17.000 --> 00:22.000]  It was good.
[00:19.000 --> 00:24.000]  It was funny. I really liked it as I was listening to it.
[00:23.000 --> 00:28.000]  There was very much a coherent vision
[00:28.000 --> 00:33.000]  that took the idea of Microsoft, by necessity,
[00:33.000 --> 00:38.000]  has to leap over the mobile area.
[00:37.000 --> 00:42.000]  To an extent, they certainly have in the cloud,
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.000]  but painting a vision beyond that.
[00:41.000 --> 00:46.000]  From a big picture, what I liked best is that
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.000]  at previous builds, there's always two keynotes.
[00:47.000 --> 00:52.000]  The first day is usually the Windows keynote,
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  and the second day is the Azure keynote.
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.000]  I think that's appropriate because that's realistically
[00:58.000 --> 01:03.000]  where Microsoft's growth and opportunities are.
[01:01.000 --> 01:06.000]  So from that perspective, I enjoyed it.
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.000]  I think the problem, though, is all that stuff on the edge.
[01:10.000 --> 01:15.000]  Microsoft talked about building a sort of thing
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.000]  from the cloud away to the edge.
[01:13.000 --> 01:18.000]  They don't have very many edge endpoints,
[01:15.000 --> 01:20.000]  and that continues to be a problem.
[01:17.000 --> 01:22.000]  Edge being the devices that people use.
[01:20.000 --> 01:25.000]  Is that what you mean?
[01:25.000 --> 01:30.000]  Not just mobile devices, but also on computers.
[01:28.000 --> 01:33.000]  The big criticism I've always had from Microsoft,
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.000]  and even under Satya Nadella, is they've done a great job
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.000]  of locking in the folks that they've always had.
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.000]  But if you're a new company starting today,
[01:43.000 --> 01:48.000]  which piece of Microsoft software are you going to buy and why?
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  And Microsoft doesn't have a very good answer
[01:48.000 --> 01:53.000]  for that question.
[01:49.000 --> 01:54.000]  Yeah, that's a very good point.
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.000]  You would probably buy Excel, right?
[01:59.000 --> 02:04.000]  Yeah, I have Office 365.
[02:00.000 --> 02:05.000]  I actually use that for my email,
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.000]  in part because I vastly prefer using email
[02:06.000 --> 02:11.000]  on an offline client, even if it's Outlook.
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.000]  The problem with Gmail is I have an assistant,
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.000]  so I have some shared mailboxes,
[02:13.000 --> 02:18.000]  and it only supports shared mailboxes
[02:15.000 --> 02:20.000]  through the online interface.
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.000]  So that's honestly the reason why I use Office 365.
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.000]  But yeah, beyond that, I used Google Docs for a year,
[02:25.000 --> 02:30.000]  or Google Apps, I should say, or whatever it's called,
[02:27.000 --> 02:32.000]  for the first several years,
[02:30.000 --> 02:35.000]  and there's times I miss it, times I don't.
[02:32.000 --> 02:37.000]  But realistically, it's not really,
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.000]  if it wasn't for my own personal,
[02:36.000 --> 02:41.000]  I can choose software-based, my own personal foibles.
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.000]  If I were an administrator,
[02:40.000 --> 02:45.000]  such as I was a larger company,
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  I'm sure I would be on Google.
[02:45.000 --> 02:50.000]  I mean, I'm obviously an edge case in that
[02:50.000 --> 02:55.000]  Windows free life, my entire life.
[02:52.000 --> 02:57.000]  But off the top of my head,
[02:53.000 --> 02:58.000]  the only Microsoft software I can think
[02:55.000 --> 03:00.000]  that I use regularly is, right now, Skype.
[02:58.000 --> 03:03.000]  I don't think I use anything else.
[03:00.000 --> 03:05.000]  I haven't had Microsoft Office in,
[03:03.000 --> 03:08.000]  oh my God, at least 10 years.
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.000]  I don't even remember.
[03:08.000 --> 03:13.000]  I don't know if I ever even used it on Mac OS X.
[03:12.000 --> 03:17.000]  You're probably better off for that case.
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.000]  If you use Excel, for real,
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.000]  which I rarely do,
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.000]  but the occasional times I do,
[03:24.000 --> 03:29.000]  Numbers is not really competitive.
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.000]  If you want to just display stuff,
[03:28.000 --> 03:33.000]  like make a little chart,
[03:29.000 --> 03:34.000]  Numbers is actually arguably better and easier,
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.000]  and certainly Excel makes some really ugly charts.
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  But there are some things I occasionally do on Excel that,
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.000]  Numbers is what it is.
[03:45.000 --> 03:50.000]  It's not an Excel competitor, though.
[03:47.000 --> 03:52.000]  I haven't used Excel in a long time,
[03:49.000 --> 03:54.000]  but I was never a serious spreadsheet person.
[03:51.000 --> 03:56.000]  But when I've seen serious spreadsheets,
[03:53.000 --> 03:58.000]  it's a very impressive piece of software.
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.000]  People have made this point before,
[04:01.000 --> 04:06.000]  but it's very true.
[04:01.000 --> 04:06.000]  It really is sort of the programming language
[04:04.000 --> 04:09.000]  for normal people.
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.000]  If you think about it,
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.000]  people bend it to do all kinds of crazy things,
[04:12.000 --> 04:17.000]  offering sort of in-place computation
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.000]  in a way that is accessible for normal people
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.000]  who don't know how to code it.
[04:19.000 --> 04:24.000]  Obviously, there's VB,
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.000]  there's basic, or whatever it's called,
[04:21.000 --> 04:26.000]  virtual, I can't even remember what it's called.
[04:23.000 --> 04:28.000]  VBScript or VBbasic?
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.000]  Yeah, whatever the scripting language is.
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.000]  So you can do actual programming,
[04:29.000 --> 04:34.000]  which, again, is still different than,
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.000]  still pretty basic.
[04:32.000 --> 04:37.000]  But even just using a cell,
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.000]  equals this cell plus that cell
[04:41.000 --> 04:46.000]  and in that respect,
[04:42.000 --> 04:47.000]  it's even more impressive
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.000]  when you think of it in that light.
[04:45.000 --> 04:50.000]  Even back in 1991,
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.000]  when I was a freshman in college,
[04:52.000 --> 04:57.000]  as a freshman,
[04:53.000 --> 04:58.000]  I ended up switching to computer science the next year,
[04:55.000 --> 05:00.000]  but as a freshman,
[04:56.000 --> 05:01.000]  I was an engineering major
[04:58.000 --> 05:03.000]  and there was a mandatory intro
[05:03.000 --> 05:08.000]  to programming course,
[05:05.000 --> 05:10.000]  but not, again,
[05:10.000 --> 05:15.000]  for me.
[05:11.000 --> 05:16.000]  I was on the computer programming team
[05:14.000 --> 05:19.000]  in high school.
[05:17.000 --> 05:22.000]  It was great for me.
[05:19.000 --> 05:24.000]  I was the type of student,
[05:20.000 --> 05:25.000]  I don't know if you were the same,
[05:21.000 --> 05:26.000]  but when I got a course like that,
[05:22.000 --> 05:27.000]  I didn't try to place out of it.
[05:24.000 --> 05:29.000]  I was just like,
[05:25.000 --> 05:30.000]  oh, this is great,
[05:25.000 --> 05:30.000]  I don't have to do any work.
[05:27.000 --> 05:32.000]  But we ended up,
[05:29.000 --> 05:34.000]  I think the second half of the thing
[05:30.000 --> 05:35.000]  was an intro to Pascal,
[05:32.000 --> 05:37.000]  which dates me.
[05:37.000 --> 05:42.000]  But I think the first month of the course
[05:39.000 --> 05:44.000]  was all spent in Excel.
[05:40.000 --> 05:45.000]  It was sort of like Excel was the,
[05:42.000 --> 05:47.000]  this is how you learn to program.
[05:45.000 --> 05:50.000]  Oh, that's interesting,
[05:46.000 --> 05:51.000]  because it's trying to build the mindset,
[05:48.000 --> 05:53.000]  not necessarily build.
[05:49.000 --> 05:54.000]  Exactly.
[05:49.000 --> 05:54.000]  That makes a ton of sense, yeah.
[05:51.000 --> 05:56.000]  And honestly,
[05:52.000 --> 05:57.000]  going through life,
[05:54.000 --> 05:59.000]  I bet more engineers do programming in Excel
[05:56.000 --> 06:01.000]  than writing source code,
[05:58.000 --> 06:03.000]  at least in some ways.
[06:00.000 --> 06:05.000]  I think the other thing that Excel has,
[06:05.000 --> 06:10.000]  but the thing that they have
[06:06.000 --> 06:11.000]  that really makes them
[06:07.000 --> 06:12.000]  is so much more approachable
[06:08.000 --> 06:13.000]  for people who think they can't program,
[06:10.000 --> 06:15.000]  but are actually doing,
[06:11.000 --> 06:16.000]  creating their own custom programmatic things,
[06:13.000 --> 06:18.000]  is it makes data structures
[06:16.000 --> 06:21.000]  completely visual.
[06:18.000 --> 06:23.000]  So there's this entire layer of abstraction
[06:21.000 --> 06:26.000]  of creating a data structure
[06:22.000 --> 06:27.000]  that is completely removed.
[06:24.000 --> 06:29.000]  You just see it,
[06:25.000 --> 06:30.000]  and so much data actually fits
[06:27.000 --> 06:32.000]  conceptually in a grid.
[06:32.000 --> 06:37.000]  You don't even know it.
[06:33.000 --> 06:38.000]  You don't realize that
[06:33.000 --> 06:38.000]  as you're setting up this
[06:35.000 --> 06:40.000]  two-dimensional,
[06:36.000 --> 06:41.000]  and I know you can do
[06:36.000 --> 06:38.000]  three-dimensional stuff, too,
[06:38.000 --> 06:43.000]  but even if it's just
[06:38.000 --> 06:43.000]  a simple little
[06:39.000 --> 06:44.000]  two-dimensional spreadsheet,
[06:41.000 --> 06:46.000]  you're creating a data structure,
[06:42.000 --> 06:47.000]  but you're not really thinking
[06:44.000 --> 06:49.000]  about it that way.
[06:45.000 --> 06:50.000]  Yeah, I think that's exactly it,
[06:47.000 --> 06:52.000]  and you can literally visualize
[06:50.000 --> 06:55.000]  how the numbers are moving around
[06:52.000 --> 06:57.000]  and moving through equations.
[06:54.000 --> 06:59.000]  You're debugging.
[06:55.000 --> 07:00.000]  You don't even realize you are,
[07:00.000 --> 07:05.000]  nothing but good things
[07:01.000 --> 07:06.000]  to say about Excel.
[07:02.000 --> 07:07.000]  So what else happened
[07:02.000 --> 07:07.000]  at this keynote?
[07:03.000 --> 07:08.000]  What are they talking about?
[07:06.000 --> 07:11.000]  What do people need to know
[07:06.000 --> 07:11.000]  about where Microsoft is,
[07:09.000 --> 07:14.000]  wants people to go?
[07:10.000 --> 07:15.000]  And for those who don't know,
[07:11.000 --> 07:16.000]  it's their developer conference,
[07:12.000 --> 07:17.000]  so it's not necessarily
[07:15.000 --> 07:20.000]  consumer-focused,
[07:15.000 --> 07:20.000]  but it's what they want
[07:17.000 --> 07:22.000]  developers to do.
[07:19.000 --> 07:24.000]  Yeah, well, I think
[07:19.000 --> 07:21.000]  that's part of the point,
[07:21.000 --> 07:26.000]  is there really wasn't anything
[07:23.000 --> 07:28.000]  for consumers in this at all.
[07:28.000 --> 07:33.000]  They have a new
[07:31.000 --> 07:36.000]  to the Amazon Echo skills,
[07:31.000 --> 07:36.000]  things like that.
[07:34.000 --> 07:39.000]  They have a new database service
[07:37.000 --> 07:42.000]  for Azure called Cosmos DB,
[07:39.000 --> 07:44.000]  which is very interesting.
[07:40.000 --> 07:45.000]  But again,
[07:41.000 --> 07:46.000]  speaking of data structures,
[07:42.000 --> 07:47.000]  not really something
[07:44.000 --> 07:49.000]  that most people would think
[07:46.000 --> 07:51.000]  about or care about.
[07:48.000 --> 07:53.000]  And whereas tomorrow,
[07:49.000 --> 07:54.000]  or what time is it?
[07:51.000 --> 07:56.000]  Yeah, tomorrow.
[07:52.000 --> 07:57.000]  I always try to speak in terms
[07:57.000 --> 08:02.000]  they will have, I think,
[07:59.000 --> 08:04.000]  more consumer-facing stuff.
[08:01.000 --> 08:06.000]  But again,
[08:01.000 --> 08:06.000]  I think it's really emblematic
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.000]  of the shift in the company
[08:04.000 --> 08:06.000]  that that is on day two.
[08:06.000 --> 08:11.000]  And to me,
[08:07.000 --> 08:12.000]  that's kind of the biggest
[08:08.000 --> 08:09.000]  high-level takeaway.
[08:09.000 --> 08:14.000]  Yeah.
[08:11.000 --> 08:16.000]  They're sort of doing
[08:14.000 --> 08:19.000]  on their own volition
[08:17.000 --> 08:22.000]  under Satya Nadella
[08:18.000 --> 08:23.000]  what some people 10 years ago,
[08:21.000 --> 08:26.000]  or I guess more than 10 years ago
[08:26.000 --> 08:31.000]  which is break the Windows
[08:28.000 --> 08:33.000]  division off into its own
[08:29.000 --> 08:34.000]  subsidiary or separate company
[08:31.000 --> 08:36.000]  or something like that.
[08:35.000 --> 08:40.000]  Let Microsoft stay focused
[08:35.000 --> 08:40.000]  on the future
[08:37.000 --> 08:42.000]  and let Windows ride out
[08:39.000 --> 08:44.000]  the role that it has to play
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.000]  as legacy infrastructure.
[08:45.000 --> 08:50.000]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.000]  And I didn't think
[08:49.000 --> 08:54.000]  they were capable of it.
[08:50.000 --> 08:55.000]  Windows was so long,
[08:55.000 --> 09:00.000]  I mean, to the extent that
[08:57.000 --> 09:02.000]  at one of these keynotes
[08:58.000 --> 09:03.000]  a while ago,
[08:58.000 --> 09:03.000]  Azure was renamed Windows Azure,
[09:00.000 --> 09:05.000]  even though it wasn't really
[09:01.000 --> 09:02.000]  Windows.
[09:02.000 --> 09:07.000]  But yeah, that's a great point.
[09:03.000 --> 09:08.000]  One of my favorite little details
[09:05.000 --> 09:10.000]  here is they announced
[09:07.000 --> 09:12.000]  you could access
[09:09.000 --> 09:14.000]  the command line in
[09:11.000 --> 09:16.000]  your Azure dashboard
[09:13.000 --> 09:18.000]  or whatever it is,
[09:14.000 --> 09:19.000]  through a web browser
[09:14.000 --> 09:16.000]  or on a mobile app.
[09:16.000 --> 09:21.000]  And it supports Bash today,
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.000]  and PowerShell is coming.
[09:19.000 --> 09:24.000]  PowerShell is the command line
[09:24.000 --> 09:29.000]  that shows it, right?
[09:26.000 --> 09:31.000]  Which one do they support first?
[09:27.000 --> 09:32.000]  They support Bash because
[09:28.000 --> 09:33.000]  what actually matters
[09:29.000 --> 09:30.000]  for most cloud applications
[09:30.000 --> 09:35.000]  is what most developers
[09:32.000 --> 09:37.000]  are used to is, you know,
[09:34.000 --> 09:39.000]  Winix and the Winix shell,
[09:36.000 --> 09:41.000]  and so that's what
[09:37.000 --> 09:38.000]  they're serving first.
[09:38.000 --> 09:43.000]  And the Windows part is coming,
[09:40.000 --> 09:45.000]  but it will come soon.
[09:44.000 --> 09:49.000]  Yeah, it isn't PowerShell
[09:45.000 --> 09:49.000]  in a nutshell.
[09:47.000 --> 09:52.000]  There was the DOS prompt,
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.000]  not a command-line terminal
[09:53.000 --> 09:58.000]  type thing,
[09:54.000 --> 09:59.000]  but DOS is a piece of crap.
[09:56.000 --> 10:01.000]  So here's something, you know,
[09:58.000 --> 10:03.000]  modern and at least,
[10:00.000 --> 10:05.000]  maybe not modeled
[10:01.000 --> 10:06.000]  after Unix shells,
[10:03.000 --> 10:08.000]  but at least is as powerful
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.000]  as a Unix shell.
[10:06.000 --> 10:11.000]  Yeah, I mean,
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.000]  it's a whole thing.
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.000]  I mean, it's a shell
[10:10.000 --> 10:15.000]  and its own scripting language,
[10:13.000 --> 10:18.000]  and it's now actually
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  open-source, but we're not.
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.000]  But yeah, it was released
[10:15.000 --> 10:18.000]  in 2006, I believe.
[10:18.000 --> 10:23.000]  I'm just looking it up.
[10:19.000 --> 10:24.000]  So I mean,
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.000]  it's very far removed
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.000]  from the sort of DOS days.
[10:23.000 --> 10:24.000]  I mean, it's a proper shell.
[10:24.000 --> 10:29.000]  Like, it's used very heavily
[10:26.000 --> 10:31.000]  by system administrators
[10:28.000 --> 10:33.000]  and folks that are managing
[10:30.000 --> 10:35.000]  computers and things like that,
[10:31.000 --> 10:32.000]  and it's used on the server.
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.000]  So I mean, it's a proper shell,
[10:34.000 --> 10:39.000]  but it's not, you know,
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.000]  it's different than,
[10:37.000 --> 10:42.000]  as one would expect,
[10:38.000 --> 10:43.000]  it's different than Bash.
[10:41.000 --> 10:46.000]  Can I just, as an aside,
[10:42.000 --> 10:47.000]  it's so funny,
[10:47.000 --> 10:52.000]  do you ever use the command line
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000]  on Mac OS X?
[10:49.000 --> 10:54.000]  You use it sometimes, right?
[10:50.000 --> 10:55.000]  Yeah, rarely,
[10:51.000 --> 10:56.000]  but I have a couple servers
[10:53.000 --> 10:58.000]  that, not the Stryker server
[10:55.000 --> 11:00.000]  that's managed,
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.000]  but I have a few other servers
[10:58.000 --> 11:03.000]  that I do stuff on,
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.000]  and I use it for that,
[11:01.000 --> 11:06.000]  but I rarely,
[11:02.000 --> 11:07.000]  I don't do much scripting
[11:03.000 --> 11:05.000]  on my main computer.
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.000]  Do you care what shell you use?
[11:07.000 --> 11:12.000]  No, I don't really care at all.
[11:09.000 --> 11:14.000]  I use it very rarely.
[11:11.000 --> 11:16.000]  I've used a Unix shell
[11:16.000 --> 11:21.000]  that's when I switched
[11:17.000 --> 11:22.000]  to computer science at Drexel,
[11:19.000 --> 11:24.000]  and I've, you know,
[11:22.000 --> 11:27.000]  I mean, I know enough to get
[11:26.000 --> 11:31.000]  whatever I need to do done,
[11:28.000 --> 11:33.000]  but I've never enjoyed it,
[11:30.000 --> 11:35.000]  never really, and I never really
[11:31.000 --> 11:33.000]  liked writing shell scripts,
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.000]  and so if I ever had anything
[11:34.000 --> 11:39.000]  that most people would write
[11:35.000 --> 11:36.000]  a shell script,
[11:36.000 --> 11:41.000]  once I found out about Perl,
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.000]  I just wrote everything in Perl
[11:39.000 --> 11:44.000]  and just treated Perl,
[11:40.000 --> 11:45.000]  if I needed to,
[11:45.000 --> 11:50.000]  and I know, I think Mac OS X
[11:48.000 --> 11:53.000]  used to, when it first shipped,
[11:49.000 --> 11:54.000]  was using TCSH as the shell
[11:52.000 --> 11:57.000]  or something, I don't know,
[11:54.000 --> 11:59.000]  and at some point
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  it switched to Bash,
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.000]  because Bash sort of become,
[11:57.000 --> 12:02.000]  is like the most popular
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  modern scripting language,
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.000]  because Linux uses it, I think,
[12:03.000 --> 12:08.000]  but I never had deep roots,
[12:05.000 --> 12:10.000]  like it was never like,
[12:06.000 --> 12:11.000]  like people get tied up
[12:07.000 --> 12:12.000]  and they have like these shell,
[12:09.000 --> 12:14.000]  or files, you know,
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.000]  and all this stuff set up
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.000]  so that you can't really switch
[12:17.000 --> 12:22.000]  shells very easily,
[12:17.000 --> 12:22.000]  because you'd have to
[12:17.000 --> 12:19.000]  rewrite it all.
[12:19.000 --> 12:24.000]  So anyway, recently I switched
[12:21.000 --> 12:26.000]  my shell on my Macs to Fish.
[12:24.000 --> 12:29.000]  Have you heard about this shell?
[12:26.000 --> 12:31.000]  I've heard you chatting about it,
[12:29.000 --> 12:34.000]  but no.
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.000]  It's fascinating,
[12:31.000 --> 12:36.000]  and I think anybody who has
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.000]  deep roots into a Unix shell
[12:35.000 --> 12:40.000]  is not going to switch,
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.000]  but it's like a new shell.
[12:38.000 --> 12:43.000]  It's something that this guy
[12:43.000 --> 12:48.000]  that engineered Apple,
[12:44.000 --> 12:49.000]  this isn't an Apple project,
[12:46.000 --> 12:51.000]  it's something he did on his
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  side, but it's amazing,
[12:48.000 --> 12:53.000]  and the thing I like about it
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  is it's like completely logical
[12:51.000 --> 12:56.000]  in terms of how you do stuff,
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.000]  and it doesn't have any kind of,
[12:57.000 --> 13:02.000]  by separating itself
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  from the history of Unix shells,
[13:00.000 --> 13:05.000]  it breaks a bunch of things
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.000]  that other Unix shells all do,
[13:06.000 --> 13:11.000]  but just for one thing,
[13:11.000 --> 13:16.000]  a bunch of dot files,
[13:13.000 --> 13:18.000]  the Unix way of making a file
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.000]  quote-unquote invisible
[13:16.000 --> 13:21.000]  is to start the name with a dot,
[13:17.000 --> 13:22.000]  which is so gross
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.000]  that we're still using that.
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.000]  But you end up with
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.000]  six of these files
[13:26.000 --> 13:31.000]  in your home folder
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  for each shell that you use,
[13:29.000 --> 13:34.000]  and they don't have nums
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  that make any sense.
[13:31.000 --> 13:36.000]  No, they drive me up the wall.
[13:32.000 --> 13:37.000]  I know exactly what you're
[13:32.000 --> 13:37.000]  talking about.
[13:34.000 --> 13:39.000]  Right, it doesn't make
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  any sense at all.
[13:36.000 --> 13:41.000]  With Phish,
[13:37.000 --> 13:42.000]  you still have a dot file,
[13:39.000 --> 13:44.000]  but it's a folder.
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.000]  What is it called?
[13:45.000 --> 13:50.000]  It's called,
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.000]  boy, I'm really exciting
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  tonight, aren't I?
[13:50.000 --> 13:55.000]  I should do this
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  late at night all the time.
[13:52.000 --> 13:57.000]  What the hell is it called?
[13:54.000 --> 13:59.000]  I think it's called dot config
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  or something like that,
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.000]  and it makes a folder
[13:58.000 --> 14:03.000]  instead of a file,
[14:00.000 --> 14:05.000]  and it's just one folder
[14:05.000 --> 14:10.000]  is where everything else goes.
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.000]  There's a folder in dot config
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  that says Phish,
[14:15.000 --> 14:20.000]  and then inside that folder
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  is all of Phish's stuff.
[14:17.000 --> 14:22.000]  So if other utilities
[14:17.000 --> 14:20.000]  use this convention,
[14:20.000 --> 14:25.000]  everything could go
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  nice and neatly
[14:22.000 --> 14:27.000]  into one folder
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  called dot config.
[14:24.000 --> 14:25.000]  Anyway, it's really neat.
[14:25.000 --> 14:30.000]  I'll put a link
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  in the show notes to Phish.
[14:27.000 --> 14:30.000]  I think it's really neat.
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.000]  So it reminds me,
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.000]  when was the last time I was on?
[14:35.000 --> 14:40.000]  2000, January 2017,
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  it looks like.
[14:37.000 --> 14:42.000]  And we talked about the Mac
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.000]  a little bit then,
[14:40.000 --> 14:45.000]  and I do have to say,
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.000]  I think pretty much that
[14:43.000 --> 14:48.000]  that episode holds up,
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  I think, pretty well
[14:45.000 --> 14:50.000]  after the news
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  that's come out
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.000]  about the Mac Pro
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  and things like that.
[14:51.000 --> 14:56.000]  I think our general presumption
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.000]  was that there was a screw-up,
[14:55.000 --> 14:56.000]  they wound up being a bakunt,
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  and they're not abandoning
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  the platform,
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  and it was just a screw-up,
[15:02.000 --> 15:03.000]  and I think that's basically
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  what ended up happening,
[15:05.000 --> 15:10.000]  so I'm glad we got
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.000]  that one right.
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.000]  Yeah, I think so too.
[15:09.000 --> 15:10.000]  Anyway, before I leave Phish,
[15:10.000 --> 15:11.000]  I'll just say this.
[15:11.000 --> 15:16.000]  If you're nerdy enough
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  to use the terminal,
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  but you've somehow never
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.000]  gotten attached to Bash
[15:16.000 --> 15:21.000]  or C-Shell or Z-Shell
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.000]  or any of those things,
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  you should give Phish a try.
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.000]  It's really easy to install
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.000]  through Homebrew,
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.000]  and I like it so much more
[15:24.000 --> 15:27.000]  than any shell I've ever tried,
[15:27.000 --> 15:32.000]  because it just somehow
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  makes sense.
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.000]  It makes sense that it comes
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  from somebody who works at Apple,
[15:31.000 --> 15:36.000]  because it sort of makes sense
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  in the way Apple software does.
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.000]  Right, that's what made me
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  think of it,
[15:36.000 --> 15:41.000]  is the idea of, one,
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.000]  even having access to a shell
[15:39.000 --> 15:40.000]  and being able to change it
[15:40.000 --> 15:41.000]  and all the things you can do
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  through a shell.
[15:43.000 --> 15:48.000]  It's a thing you do
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  on computers,
[15:46.000 --> 15:51.000]  which is, I was starting to
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  remember why I went back
[15:48.000 --> 15:49.000]  to that last episode,
[15:49.000 --> 15:50.000]  but yeah, that's why.
[15:50.000 --> 15:51.000]  It's a great example.
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  Yeah, it does things like it
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  has, like, if you want to change
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  the syntax coloring for the shell,
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  like a command is this color,
[15:58.000 --> 16:00.000]  the arguments are this color,
[16:00.000 --> 16:01.000]  the output's this color,
[16:01.000 --> 16:02.000]  an error is this color.
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  When you config, you don't have
[16:04.000 --> 16:05.000]  to just type in a file.
[16:05.000 --> 16:06.000]  You can do something, and it opens
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  a little local web browser window,
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  and so you can visually pick
[16:10.000 --> 16:11.000]  the colors and actually see
[16:11.000 --> 16:13.000]  the colors as you edit them.
[16:13.000 --> 16:14.000]  Oh, nice.
[16:14.000 --> 16:16.000]  It's amazing stuff.
[16:16.000 --> 16:19.000]  Anyway, it's really cool.
[16:19.000 --> 16:23.000]  So anyway, PowerShell is coming soon,
[16:23.000 --> 16:26.000]  and Bash is already the default
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  and first available thing.
[16:28.000 --> 16:29.000]  That's amazing.
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  Yeah, for this dashboard
[16:31.000 --> 16:32.000]  sort of interface.
[16:32.000 --> 16:33.000]  The other thing I saw
[16:33.000 --> 16:34.000]  was announced was,
[16:34.000 --> 16:35.000]  I forget what they call it,
[16:35.000 --> 16:37.000]  but whatever Microsoft's version
[16:37.000 --> 16:39.000]  of Xcode is, what's it called?
[16:39.000 --> 16:40.000]  Virtual Studio?
[16:40.000 --> 16:41.000]  Visual Studio, whatever they call it.
[16:41.000 --> 16:42.000]  Oh, Visual Studio, yeah,
[16:42.000 --> 16:43.000]  not Virtual Studio.
[16:43.000 --> 16:44.000]  Visual Studio is now,
[16:44.000 --> 16:45.000]  I know it wasn't a surprise,
[16:45.000 --> 16:47.000]  but there's a version of it
[16:47.000 --> 16:50.000]  on a Mac now, which is crazy.
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  Yep, and they did a demo,
[16:52.000 --> 16:53.000]  and it was more like,
[16:53.000 --> 16:55.000]  oh, we're doing a demo on a Mac.
[16:55.000 --> 16:56.000]  It wasn't like a,
[16:56.000 --> 16:57.000]  we're demoing this program.
[16:57.000 --> 16:58.000]  Actually, when they were doing the,
[16:58.000 --> 16:59.000]  I think it was when they were
[16:59.000 --> 17:01.000]  demoing the shell,
[17:01.000 --> 17:04.000]  and it was on a Mac.
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.000]  And that, it's of a piece.
[17:07.000 --> 17:08.000]  It's the exact same,
[17:08.000 --> 17:09.000]  two sides of the same coin
[17:09.000 --> 17:12.000]  with the Windows keynote
[17:12.000 --> 17:13.000]  being on day two.
[17:13.000 --> 17:17.000]  The entire idea that,
[17:17.000 --> 17:18.000]  if you're developing on
[17:18.000 --> 17:21.000]  Windows server-side technologies,
[17:21.000 --> 17:22.000]  the assumption that you're developing
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  with a Windows client
[17:24.000 --> 17:25.000]  with your hands on the keyboard
[17:25.000 --> 17:26.000]  is no longer there.
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  They're completely committed
[17:28.000 --> 17:31.000]  and realize that,
[17:31.000 --> 17:32.000]  I don't know if it's a majority
[17:32.000 --> 17:33.000]  of developers,
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  but certainly an enormous chunk
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.000]  of them are using Macs
[17:37.000 --> 17:38.000]  as their client,
[17:38.000 --> 17:39.000]  whether they're writing
[17:39.000 --> 17:40.000]  Mac software or not,
[17:40.000 --> 17:41.000]  even if they're just doing
[17:41.000 --> 17:42.000]  web development
[17:42.000 --> 17:43.000]  or Windows development
[17:43.000 --> 17:44.000]  or something like that,
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  or anything server-side, I think.
[17:46.000 --> 17:47.000]  There's an enormous chunk of them
[17:47.000 --> 17:50.000]  who are using MacBooks.
[17:50.000 --> 17:53.000]  Yep, and the platforms
[17:53.000 --> 17:55.000]  that they're developing for,
[17:55.000 --> 17:58.000]  yes, on PC, it's still,
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  Windows still has a dominant,
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  more than dominant share,
[18:02.000 --> 18:05.000]  but PCs aren't,
[18:05.000 --> 18:06.000]  PCs are the past,
[18:06.000 --> 18:08.000]  I mean, in a very real way,
[18:08.000 --> 18:11.000]  or to a topic I'm sure we'll get to,
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  they were never even a thing,
[18:13.000 --> 18:15.000]  and that's a reality
[18:15.000 --> 18:17.000]  that Microsoft has to deal with.
[18:17.000 --> 18:20.000]  And I think they by and large are,
[18:20.000 --> 18:21.000]  again, that doesn't mean
[18:21.000 --> 18:22.000]  that they're out of the woods
[18:22.000 --> 18:23.000]  because they still have,
[18:23.000 --> 18:24.000]  they still have to actually
[18:24.000 --> 18:25.000]  reach consumers,
[18:25.000 --> 18:27.000]  actually get in front of them,
[18:27.000 --> 18:28.000]  both in terms,
[18:28.000 --> 18:29.000]  and that applies to business
[18:29.000 --> 18:30.000]  just as much as it applies
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.000]  to end users,
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.000]  but at least they're not stuck
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  focused on the past.
[18:38.000 --> 18:44.000]  Yeah, so now we're in an unusual,
[18:44.000 --> 18:47.000]  I think, how things change situation
[18:47.000 --> 18:48.000]  where Microsoft is the company
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  that's flexible about what,
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  what machines people are using
[18:52.000 --> 18:53.000]  to develop against their technologies
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  and Apple's the company
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  that makes you develop on a Mac
[18:57.000 --> 18:59.000]  to write for their phone OS.
[18:59.000 --> 19:01.000]  Right, exactly, exactly.
[19:01.000 --> 19:02.000]  Not that I blame Apple for it,
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.000]  that might have come out as me,
[19:04.000 --> 19:05.000]  you know, blaming them,
[19:05.000 --> 19:06.000]  it makes perfect sense.
[19:06.000 --> 19:16.000]  But it's just a funny situation.
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  Apple's the company with an operating system
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  with such overwhelming market share
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  that they can compel developers
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  to buy a machine that they otherwise
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  wouldn't buy just to do development for it.
[19:26.000 --> 19:30.000]  Yeah, it's hard to,
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  especially if you were following Apple,
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  I'm sure it's harder for you than for me,
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  I mean, back in, I was following Apple
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  in the 90s, but I wasn't using one.
[19:38.000 --> 19:43.000]  And to really appreciate the extent
[19:43.000 --> 19:46.000]  to which they are not the underdog at all.
[19:46.000 --> 19:49.000]  It's easy for that situation to change
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  on the ground before it changes
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  sort of your mental state.
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  And I think that's a problem for Apple,
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.000]  that was a problem for Apple internally too,
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.000]  like the way you act and behave
[19:59.000 --> 20:02.000]  changes when you're dominant
[20:02.000 --> 20:04.000]  as opposed to when you're, you know,
[20:04.000 --> 20:06.000]  the sort of scrappy underdog.
[20:06.000 --> 20:10.000]  Yeah, totally.
[20:10.000 --> 20:12.000]  So what else is going on at Surface,
[20:12.000 --> 20:14.000]  or not Surface, at Build?
[20:14.000 --> 20:16.000]  You know, that's the conference I was at the one time,
[20:16.000 --> 20:17.000]  I was in a video.
[20:17.000 --> 20:19.000]  Yes, that's right.
[20:19.000 --> 20:21.000]  It feels like a long time ago.
[20:21.000 --> 20:24.000]  Well, it's crazy how,
[20:24.000 --> 20:26.000]  I mean, it was a while ago,
[20:26.000 --> 20:29.000]  it has to have been, what, four or five years ago?
[20:29.000 --> 20:30.000]  Three years ago, I think.
[20:30.000 --> 20:31.000]  I think it was three.
[20:31.000 --> 20:32.000]  Was that all?
[20:32.000 --> 20:33.000]  I think so.
[20:33.000 --> 20:34.000]  For some reason, I thought I was still in the States
[20:34.000 --> 20:35.000]  when that happened, but.
[20:35.000 --> 20:36.000]  Yeah, I think it was three years ago,
[20:36.000 --> 20:37.000]  but I could be wrong.
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  But long story short, for those who don't remember,
[20:39.000 --> 20:40.000]  this was when I was working with Brent Simmons
[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  and Dave Wiskus.
[20:42.000 --> 20:43.000]  We called ourselves Q branch,
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  we had our app Vesper.
[20:45.000 --> 20:50.000]  And we did the syncing, our own syncing backend
[20:50.000 --> 20:51.000]  for various reasons.
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  But we built it on, I guess,
[20:53.000 --> 20:56.000]  I think we were there, we were doing it at the time
[20:56.000 --> 21:00.000]  when they called it Windows Azure.
[21:00.000 --> 21:03.000]  And they made us one of the examples
[21:03.000 --> 21:06.000]  in a little video that they showed in the keynote.
[21:06.000 --> 21:09.000]  Flew us out there and everything, it was kind of nice.
[21:09.000 --> 21:11.000]  Kind of weird though.
[21:11.000 --> 21:13.000]  Yeah, they have this,
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  they have a real-time translator for Microsoft PowerPoint
[21:15.000 --> 21:18.000]  that's kind of nifty.
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  So when you can be presenting and it will be,
[21:20.000 --> 21:25.000]  show real-time translation of the,
[21:25.000 --> 21:28.000]  yeah, so that's kind of interesting.
[21:28.000 --> 21:33.000]  But again, it was mostly all backend stuff,
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  which is fine.
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  I think as far as consumer-facing stuff,
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  the one today is probably going to be more interesting.
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.000]  But then again, they just announced the Windows S
[21:44.000 --> 21:47.000]  and the new laptops a couple weeks ago.
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.000]  So I think there supposedly might be a Cortana speaker,
[21:50.000 --> 21:55.000]  like an Echo-type device.
[21:55.000 --> 21:59.000]  I mean, actually getting customers' hands
[21:59.000 --> 22:01.000]  is going to be the challenge.
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  I guess the reason, I was going to say,
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  as somebody who observes Apple, it's weird,
[22:05.000 --> 22:11.000]  because I have muscle memory,
[22:11.000 --> 22:15.000]  and it's weird to see a company that's so un-Apple-like.
[22:15.000 --> 22:18.000]  It's baffling to me that they would hold an event
[22:18.000 --> 22:21.000]  a week before their big developer conference
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  where they would talk about a new operating system
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  and unveil these new products.
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  Like, why wouldn't you do that in a keynote?
[22:27.000 --> 22:30.000]  But I'm guessing the keynote this morning ran long,
[22:30.000 --> 22:31.000]  and then the Windows one tomorrow,
[22:31.000 --> 22:35.000]  their keynote's already run long.
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  Right, and today was really,
[22:37.000 --> 22:40.000]  it was much more of, yeah, it was pretty hardcore,
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  like backend development
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  or line-of-business application sort of stuff.
[22:44.000 --> 22:48.000]  I mean, it wasn't a really consumer-facing thing at all,
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.000]  not in the slightest.
[22:50.000 --> 22:53.000]  And yeah, maybe they could have announced the things tomorrow,
[22:53.000 --> 22:57.000]  but I think, yeah, there's a very clear sort of bifurcation,
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  and I think you nailed it before,
[22:59.000 --> 23:01.000]  like Windows is sort of its own thing,
[23:01.000 --> 23:04.000]  particularly the consumer-facing side of Windows.
[23:04.000 --> 23:08.000]  And I think there's relatively free rein to do what they can
[23:08.000 --> 23:10.000]  to support and earn customers,
[23:10.000 --> 23:14.000]  but that doesn't necessarily really have much impact,
[23:14.000 --> 23:16.000]  particularly from a strategic perspective
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  on the rest of Microsoft,
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.000]  which is really the future of the company,
[23:21.000 --> 23:25.000]  and this is probably a good example of that.
[23:25.000 --> 23:26.000]  It was weird.
[23:26.000 --> 23:29.000]  I know today's build, they move it around,
[23:29.000 --> 23:31.000]  I think they often move it around,
[23:31.000 --> 23:33.000]  but this year's was in Seattle.
[23:33.000 --> 23:34.000]  When I went two or three years ago,
[23:34.000 --> 23:35.000]  three, four years ago, whenever it was,
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  it was in San Francisco, in Moscone,
[23:37.000 --> 23:42.000]  which only added to this sort of weird feeling,
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  bizarro, like I was in a bizarro developer,
[23:44.000 --> 23:49.000]  bizarro WWDC, because they even had the keynote,
[23:49.000 --> 23:54.000]  third floor, what Apple always calls the room presidio.
[23:54.000 --> 24:00.000]  Those big convention spaces are sort of modular.
[24:00.000 --> 24:03.000]  There's walls that can be moved around to change the shape
[24:03.000 --> 24:07.000]  and make rooms slightly bigger or smaller.
[24:07.000 --> 24:09.000]  But the thing that Microsoft did,
[24:09.000 --> 24:12.000]  and I've seen so many keynotes in that room,
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.000]  because MacWorld Expo used to have keynotes
[24:14.000 --> 24:18.000]  in the same room, WWDC every year.
[24:18.000 --> 24:19.000]  Well, I guess those are the two things,
[24:19.000 --> 24:23.000]  but they're MacWorld Expo and WWDC keynotes in that room,
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  and Apple's configuration of the room
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  is almost always the same.
[24:27.000 --> 24:30.000]  You'd almost think that the room always looks like that,
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  but it's actually like an Apple setup.
[24:32.000 --> 24:36.000]  When WWDC's done, everything in there's out.
[24:36.000 --> 24:41.000]  And the thing that Microsoft did was they had their stage
[24:41.000 --> 24:44.000]  along what in Apple's configuration is the side.
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.000]  Apple sets the room with the stage in the front,
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  and the room goes back long.
[24:49.000 --> 24:54.000]  Microsoft set it up so that the stage was wide
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  and the room wasn't as deep.
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.000]  And the way that that made sense,
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  even though it made more people,
[25:00.000 --> 25:01.000]  everybody was closer to the stage
[25:01.000 --> 25:03.000]  in Microsoft's configuration,
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  but people were further from the center
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  if you didn't have a center seat.
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.000]  And they made up for that by having huge screens
[25:09.000 --> 25:11.000]  that were just showed the same.
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  Instead of having one big screen that shows something,
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  they had like a wall of screens
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  that all showed the same thing over and over again.
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  And it just weirded me out.
[25:21.000 --> 25:24.000]  It's like coming home
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  and somebody has moved all of the furniture.
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  Like everything is the same,
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.000]  except they've rotated every room in your house by 90 degrees.
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  That would be weird.
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.000]  But yeah, no Moscone keynote again this year.
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  Well, they've been in the, what is it,
[25:40.000 --> 25:43.000]  the Billy Graham Auditorium.
[25:43.000 --> 25:44.000]  Is that what it's called?
[25:44.000 --> 25:47.000]  I have something like that.
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  Apple might never do a Moscone keynote again.
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  Right, that's what I was just going to say.
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  It might be, which is fine.
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  It wasn't the greatest.
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.000]  I'm not a big fan of the Apple setup in Moscone.
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  I'm not either, really.
[26:01.000 --> 26:02.000]  I don't have anything against it,
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.000]  but I thought the Microsoft setup was actually very nice.
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.000]  It worked very well.
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  And I felt like everybody got to,
[26:10.000 --> 26:11.000]  you couldn't really see,
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  may not be able to see the actual people,
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.000]  but I feel like if you were seated along the side,
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  you had a much bigger screen in front of you
[26:18.000 --> 26:22.000]  than you get seated in the back in Moscone in Apple setup.
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.000]  Right, exactly.
[26:24.000 --> 26:25.000]  Yeah, I don't think Apple,
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  Apple might never have an event in San Francisco again.
[26:27.000 --> 26:28.000]  You never say never.
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  I mean, who knows?
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  Because I feel like for their smaller events,
[26:32.000 --> 26:33.000]  they're going to have them at their headquarters
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  in the Steve Jobs Theater.
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.000]  I don't think you name the theater Steve Jobs Theater
[26:38.000 --> 26:41.000]  unless you intend to use it quite a bit.
[26:41.000 --> 26:42.000]  To unveil new products.
[26:42.000 --> 26:43.000]  Right.
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  I'm sure they're, you know.
[26:45.000 --> 26:46.000]  Have you been to the new campus yet?
[26:46.000 --> 26:47.000]  No, I've never.
[26:47.000 --> 26:48.000]  I don't even know where it is.
[26:48.000 --> 26:49.000]  I was asking about it when I was out there
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.000]  for the Mac Pro Summit,
[26:53.000 --> 26:57.000]  or whatever you want, roundtable discussion.
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  I guess it just isn't close.
[26:59.000 --> 27:00.000]  I don't know.
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  Yeah, I used to work there.
[27:02.000 --> 27:05.000]  In one of the buildings that was torn down.
[27:05.000 --> 27:07.000]  So I definitely know where it is.
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.000]  But yeah, it's like another exit down the freeway
[27:09.000 --> 27:13.000]  from where the current campus is.
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  You can drive there through city roads,
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  but yeah, it's a little bit of a hike.
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.000]  It's on the other side of the freeway.
[27:20.000 --> 27:21.000]  So it just wasn't convenient,
[27:21.000 --> 27:22.000]  and I didn't have a car,
[27:22.000 --> 27:25.000]  so it wasn't like I was going to take an Uber
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  to go look at a construction site.
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  I mean, the flyovers that people publish
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  from those drones are probably better
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.000]  than what you'd get looking at the ground from the outside.
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.000]  Yep, yeah, I think so.
[27:39.000 --> 27:43.000]  I mean, you've got to imagine.
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.000]  Well, I guess we'll see with the iPhone announcement.
[27:47.000 --> 27:50.000]  But they did that in San Jose also,
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.000]  not last year, but when they did the watch.
[27:54.000 --> 27:59.000]  The watch unveiling was in San Jose.
[27:59.000 --> 28:00.000]  Yeah, where was that?
[28:00.000 --> 28:01.000]  I forget where it was.
[28:01.000 --> 28:02.000]  I don't think it was San Jose.
[28:02.000 --> 28:10.000]  No, the watch unveiling was at the college in Cupertino.
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  Oh, was that in Cupertino?
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  I thought that was in San Jose.
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  It's like some, I forget the name of the college,
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  but De Anza or something.
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  I forget what the hell it is, but it was not.
[28:20.000 --> 28:21.000]  No, the one that was in San Jose
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.000]  was an iPad event in 2011, I think, or 2012.
[28:26.000 --> 28:27.000]  I don't know.
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  It was right before Scott Forstall got fired.
[28:29.000 --> 28:35.000]  How was the De Anza auditorium or whatever it was?
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  It was all right.
[28:37.000 --> 28:40.000]  It wasn't anything to write home about.
[28:40.000 --> 28:41.000]  That was the one where Apple built
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  a big mysterious white box out front.
[28:43.000 --> 28:44.000]  Right, right, right.
[28:44.000 --> 28:45.000]  De Anza College.
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  Is that what it is, De Anza College?
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  Yep.
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  It was okay.
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.000]  I'm not surprised that they haven't been back since.
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  I don't think it was great.
[28:56.000 --> 28:58.000]  I think the one thing people don't seem to understand
[28:58.000 --> 29:01.000]  is that the Steve Jobs Theater is not that big either.
[29:01.000 --> 29:07.000]  There's no way they can't have a WWDC keynote there.
[29:07.000 --> 29:10.000]  Some people have speculated that maybe this year
[29:10.000 --> 29:12.000]  they'll secretly bus everybody to the new campus
[29:12.000 --> 29:16.000]  to have the keynote there or something.
[29:16.000 --> 29:19.000]  You can't bus 5,000 people there.
[29:19.000 --> 29:21.000]  But B, it's not a 5,000 person auditorium.
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  I don't know what the seating capacity is.
[29:23.000 --> 29:24.000]  And C, they don't want 5,000 people
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  running around on campus.
[29:26.000 --> 29:29.000]  Right, I don't think they want people on their campus.
[29:29.000 --> 29:36.000]  Well, the old one, Town Hall, that was tiny.
[29:36.000 --> 29:38.000]  It is tiny.
[29:38.000 --> 29:42.000]  Yeah, that makes sense though.
[29:42.000 --> 29:47.000]  I bet WWDC will end up back in San Francisco.
[29:47.000 --> 29:48.000]  We'll see.
[29:48.000 --> 29:50.000]  They'll probably see how it goes this year.
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  Because the reason it's in San Jose this year
[29:52.000 --> 29:54.000]  is because Moscone Center is under construction.
[29:54.000 --> 29:55.000]  I don't believe that.
[29:55.000 --> 29:56.000]  I really don't.
[29:56.000 --> 30:01.000]  Well, basically everyone is not in Moscone by and large.
[30:01.000 --> 30:03.000]  Have there been any big events there?
[30:03.000 --> 30:05.000]  I know only part of Moscone is under construction.
[30:05.000 --> 30:08.000]  But I don't think Apple is the only one to meet.
[30:08.000 --> 30:10.000]  Well, there's stuff on the schedule if you look.
[30:10.000 --> 30:14.000]  So Moscone North and South, the big expo hall ones,
[30:14.000 --> 30:17.000]  are closed and they're ripping up the street.
[30:17.000 --> 30:18.000]  If there's an argument for it,
[30:18.000 --> 30:20.000]  it's the fact that they've got the street ripped up.
[30:20.000 --> 30:22.000]  I guess that's Howard Street is all ripped up
[30:22.000 --> 30:25.000]  for the North and South expansion.
[30:25.000 --> 30:28.000]  But Moscone West is still open and is not being renovated.
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.000]  Before Apple made this announcement,
[30:31.000 --> 30:32.000]  you could look on the schedule
[30:32.000 --> 30:35.000]  and there was one open week in June.
[30:35.000 --> 30:41.000]  But otherwise, there's stuff in Moscone West all the time.
[30:41.000 --> 30:42.000]  I could be wrong.
[30:42.000 --> 30:44.000]  You're right.
[30:44.000 --> 30:45.000]  I don't know.
[30:45.000 --> 30:47.000]  Who cares if the street's ripped up?
[30:47.000 --> 30:48.000]  I've seen people say,
[30:48.000 --> 30:49.000]  well, the street's all ripped up.
[30:49.000 --> 30:50.000]  Who gives a crap?
[30:50.000 --> 30:51.000]  I don't know.
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  It's not like everybody's driving down Howard Street
[30:53.000 --> 30:55.000]  to get to WWDC.
[30:55.000 --> 30:56.000]  I think if Apple wanted to have it
[30:56.000 --> 30:59.000]  at Moscone West this year, they would have.
[30:59.000 --> 31:01.000]  I think there's other reasons,
[31:01.000 --> 31:03.000]  whether they got a better deal,
[31:03.000 --> 31:05.000]  whether they really...
[31:05.000 --> 31:07.000]  I do think Apple is,
[31:07.000 --> 31:09.000]  if you can put a personality on a company,
[31:09.000 --> 31:12.000]  they're a homebody company.
[31:12.000 --> 31:14.000]  They're not a San Francisco company.
[31:14.000 --> 31:16.000]  I know they have a couple of offices there,
[31:16.000 --> 31:19.000]  but they really are, as a company,
[31:19.000 --> 31:22.000]  they're at home on their campus in Cupertino,
[31:22.000 --> 31:26.000]  and I feel like being closer to home is better for them.
[31:26.000 --> 31:27.000]  Yeah, no question.
[31:27.000 --> 31:30.000]  I mean, just being in the Valley,
[31:30.000 --> 31:35.000]  they're not its own insular sort of culture.
[31:35.000 --> 31:37.000]  It's much less interspersed.
[31:37.000 --> 31:39.000]  Obviously, at an employee level, that's not necessarily the case,
[31:39.000 --> 31:42.000]  but especially once you get more into senior management,
[31:42.000 --> 31:44.000]  I mean, it's its own world.
[31:44.000 --> 31:47.000]  It's in the same geographic area,
[31:47.000 --> 31:49.000]  but the rest of the Valley, I think,
[31:49.000 --> 31:52.000]  is much more intertwined with Google,
[31:52.000 --> 31:54.000]  and there's much more of a sort of back and forth
[31:54.000 --> 31:57.000]  in that perspective when it comes to big Valley companies
[31:57.000 --> 32:00.000]  and San Francisco.
[32:00.000 --> 32:04.000]  But yeah, Apple has always been its own universe,
[32:04.000 --> 32:06.000]  and you see that all over the place,
[32:06.000 --> 32:07.000]  not just in the Valley.
[32:07.000 --> 32:08.000]  You see it online.
[32:08.000 --> 32:10.000]  You see it when it comes to Apple fans.
[32:10.000 --> 32:12.000]  There's a lot of people who are Apple fans
[32:12.000 --> 32:14.000]  that are not necessarily tech fans.
[32:14.000 --> 32:16.000]  I certainly see that when it comes to readers.
[32:16.000 --> 32:22.000]  And you see it in popular culture where it's interesting.
[32:22.000 --> 32:26.000]  It really is its own sort of entity for better or worse.
[32:26.000 --> 32:28.000]  Yeah, and I think at a practical level,
[32:28.000 --> 32:30.000]  it's absolutely the case.
[32:30.000 --> 32:32.000]  I mean, there's no argument, no spin.
[32:32.000 --> 32:36.000]  It's just a fact that San Jose is so much closer
[32:36.000 --> 32:40.000]  to Apple's campus or campuses in Cupertino
[32:40.000 --> 32:45.000]  that for engineers at Apple who have things to do that with,
[32:45.000 --> 32:47.000]  things to do that week that they need to be at the office,
[32:47.000 --> 32:48.000]  they can swing by.
[32:48.000 --> 32:50.000]  They might be able to do a couple of hours work
[32:50.000 --> 32:55.000]  in their office and then go to WWDC in the afternoon
[32:55.000 --> 32:56.000]  for labs or something like that.
[32:56.000 --> 32:59.000]  And people might get, attendees might get interaction
[32:59.000 --> 33:02.000]  with significantly more engineers from Apple
[33:02.000 --> 33:06.000]  who couldn't take an entire day to go up to San Francisco
[33:06.000 --> 33:08.000]  because it's night and day.
[33:08.000 --> 33:11.000]  I mean, San Francisco can be over an hour away
[33:11.000 --> 33:12.000]  depending on traffic.
[33:12.000 --> 33:16.000]  And San Jose, it's probably like 10, 15 minute drive.
[33:16.000 --> 33:18.000]  Yep, yep, exactly.
[33:18.000 --> 33:21.000]  You found a good spot for the talk show?
[33:21.000 --> 33:23.000]  Yeah, yeah, I'm in the California theater
[33:23.000 --> 33:29.000]  where that iPad event was, the one that was in San Jose.
[33:29.000 --> 33:32.000]  So is it a lot bigger than the old place?
[33:32.000 --> 33:33.000]  The place where I had my show?
[33:33.000 --> 33:34.000]  Yeah.
[33:34.000 --> 33:35.000]  Oh my God, it's so much bigger.
[33:35.000 --> 33:38.000]  I think it has like an 1,100 seat capacity.
[33:38.000 --> 33:39.000]  Oh, wow.
[33:39.000 --> 33:43.000]  I think when we had it in Mezzanine in San Francisco,
[33:43.000 --> 33:46.000]  which I love, which I still, I love that facility.
[33:46.000 --> 33:47.000]  I love doing the show there.
[33:47.000 --> 33:50.000]  But I think we capped it at 500.
[33:50.000 --> 33:54.000]  I think Mezzanine's attendance cap
[33:54.000 --> 33:56.000]  is significantly higher than that.
[33:56.000 --> 34:00.000]  But 500 seems to, and judging from people's reactions
[34:00.000 --> 34:03.000]  over the years, it keeps it from getting too crowded.
[34:03.000 --> 34:06.000]  I don't want to pack the most number of people in there.
[34:06.000 --> 34:08.000]  I feel bad when people, I think tickets sold out
[34:08.000 --> 34:09.000]  in like 10 minutes last year.
[34:09.000 --> 34:13.000]  So I feel bad that people who want to go can't come,
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  but I'd rather have everybody,
[34:15.000 --> 34:18.000]  I'd rather have fewer people come and more people excluded,
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.000]  but have everybody be comfortable.
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.000]  Yeah, are there going to be drinks?
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.000]  I think that's probably the more pressing question.
[34:24.000 --> 34:25.000]  There will be drinks, and I don't
[34:25.000 --> 34:28.000]  know how that's going to work, because it's
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.000]  a real theater theater, and I don't know how easy.
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.000]  Yeah, I'm looking at the pictures right now.
[34:32.000 --> 34:33.000]  Right, I don't know how easy it'll
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.000]  be for people who are sitting in the middle of a row
[34:35.000 --> 34:36.000]  to go get drinks.
[34:36.000 --> 34:37.000]  So I don't know, it might have to be
[34:37.000 --> 34:42.000]  in sort of a get your load on before the show starts
[34:42.000 --> 34:43.000]  type situation.
[34:43.000 --> 34:44.000]  That was the great thing about Mezzanine,
[34:44.000 --> 34:45.000]  is you could like, I mean obviously
[34:45.000 --> 34:47.000]  there was the seating, and if you were in a seat
[34:47.000 --> 34:50.000]  while the interviewer or the show was going on,
[34:50.000 --> 34:51.000]  you wouldn't get up and go.
[34:51.000 --> 34:53.000]  But you could also just sort of be in the back
[34:53.000 --> 34:57.000]  and be mingling a little bit and getting a drink.
[34:57.000 --> 35:01.000]  So yeah, it kind of served a, you could watch the show
[35:01.000 --> 35:04.000]  in multiple ways, which was nice.
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  Well, we'll see, I don't know.
[35:06.000 --> 35:09.000]  But 1,100 people, Jesus, that's gonna be nerve-wracking.
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  There's a balcony and everything.
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  It does, oh, it's very beautiful.
[35:13.000 --> 35:17.000]  I'm looking at the pictures right now.
[35:17.000 --> 35:21.000]  Tickets still aren't on sale, but they will be soon.
[35:21.000 --> 35:22.000]  Oh, that's right.
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.000]  Okay, I forgot that you hadn't.
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  Maybe you can get them on sale by the time
[35:27.000 --> 35:28.000]  you post the podcast.
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  I am, I'm not waiting until the last minute,
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  but there's lots of little, it's not too much work.
[35:32.000 --> 35:34.000]  I don't have to, it's not like I'm sitting there
[35:34.000 --> 35:36.000]  hooking microphones up and stuff,
[35:36.000 --> 35:39.000]  but there's a lot of details to be worked out yet.
[35:39.000 --> 35:40.000]  Anyway.
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  Well, hopefully I didn't give anything away.
[35:42.000 --> 35:43.000]  No, no, no, none of that's a secret.
[35:43.000 --> 35:46.000]  Even the venue, it's right there on Apple's website
[35:46.000 --> 35:49.000]  and stuff like that, so I'm not keeping it secret.
[35:49.000 --> 35:50.000]  Anyway, let's take a break.
[35:50.000 --> 35:51.000]  I'll thank our first sponsor.
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  It's our good friends at Fracture.
[35:53.000 --> 35:57.000]  Fracture is the photo decor company that's out to rescue
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  your favorite images from the digital ether.
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  That's their words, not mine.
[36:01.000 --> 36:02.000]  Here's what they do.
[36:02.000 --> 36:03.000]  They take your photos and they print them
[36:03.000 --> 36:06.000]  basically on glass, right there on the glass, on the glass.
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  Not a piece of paper glued to glass.
[36:08.000 --> 36:09.000]  I don't know what they have.
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  They have custom proprietary stuff.
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  They just put glass into the printer.
[36:14.000 --> 36:17.000]  The printer puts your photo right on the glass
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.000]  and then they mail it to you and it looks amazing.
[36:19.000 --> 36:23.000]  It's got that retina effect where it just looks like,
[36:23.000 --> 36:24.000]  it doesn't look, it looks,
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.000]  there's just such a different effect
[36:26.000 --> 36:29.000]  than a piece of paper behind a piece of glass in a frame.
[36:29.000 --> 36:32.000]  And it takes all the pain in the ass stuff
[36:32.000 --> 36:33.000]  out of hanging pictures up
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  because this happens to me every time.
[36:35.000 --> 36:38.000]  Every time I used to get like Ikea frames
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.000]  or something like that and you put a photo in there
[36:40.000 --> 36:42.000]  and then you have to get those little things on the back
[36:42.000 --> 36:45.000]  that secure the cardboard, you flip them up
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.000]  and then you put the picture in
[36:47.000 --> 36:48.000]  and you put the cardboard back in
[36:48.000 --> 36:49.000]  and you flip them back down.
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.000]  And inevitably the picture goes like two degrees off
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  and you got to open it up, start all over again.
[36:54.000 --> 36:55.000]  What a pain in the ass.
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  With the pictures from Fracture,
[36:57.000 --> 36:58.000]  there's nothing like that can happen.
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.000]  It's just a piece of glass so it's always perfectly aligned.
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  And they ship you everything you need
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  to hang it on the wall in the box.
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  They even include the wall anchor.
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  Just upload your digital photo on their website,
[37:09.000 --> 37:12.000]  pick the size and just wait for it to show up in the mail.
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  That's it, could not be easier.
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  Where do you go to find out more?
[37:16.000 --> 37:21.000]  fractureme.com slash podcast.
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  Not, every time I read it,
[37:23.000 --> 37:24.000]  I feel like I'm making a mistake
[37:24.000 --> 37:25.000]  and that that's some kind of placeholder,
[37:25.000 --> 37:29.000]  but that's really the URL, fractureme.com slash podcast.
[37:29.000 --> 37:33.000]  And then I guess they use the same URL for all podcasts.
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  But then at the end, when you buy it, they'll say,
[37:35.000 --> 37:36.000]  hey, where'd you find out about Fracture?
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  And you can say the talk show.
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  Hey, go buy some for Father's Day.
[37:40.000 --> 37:41.000]  It's a great, great gift.
[37:41.000 --> 37:42.000]  Too late for Mother's Day.
[37:42.000 --> 37:43.000]  Mother's Day is like two days from now,
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.000]  but Father's Day is coming up next month.
[37:47.000 --> 37:48.000]  What an amazing gift.
[37:48.000 --> 37:52.000]  Go buy a fracture for your father, your husband,
[37:52.000 --> 37:53.000]  anything like that.
[37:53.000 --> 37:54.000]  What a great gift.
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.000]  Well, Fracture Me is memorable.
[37:57.000 --> 37:58.000]  Yeah.
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  And so, URLs are hard.
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  There's someone who was making fun of,
[38:02.000 --> 38:05.000]  there's tweets on the effect of tech people
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  are so uncreative that they have a site
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  about strategy and tech culture techery.
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  And I'm like, it's true.
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  I have no excuse.
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  I mean, Derry Firewall is always,
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  I've always like, damn it,
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  I should have hired you to get a name,
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  to find me a name before I started.
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  But now it's too late.
[38:23.000 --> 38:24.000]  Now it's too late.
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  But the other thing, too, is getting a URL is hard.
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  And one of the things, when I started,
[38:28.000 --> 38:29.000]  I had no money.
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  I was in debt.
[38:31.000 --> 38:34.000]  And the idea of going out and spending money
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.000]  to get a URL or whatever or Twitter handle,
[38:38.000 --> 38:39.000]  all that stuff,
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  one of the advantages of checkery is it was available.
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  I would, like I said,
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  I probably wouldn't use it again if I was starting over
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  because it's hard to say, hard to spell,
[38:47.000 --> 38:50.000]  which is not a good combo.
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  But yeah, it's hard.
[38:53.000 --> 38:57.000]  The whole URL Twitter handle thing is, it's tough.
[38:57.000 --> 39:00.000]  And I remember fracturing me,
[39:00.000 --> 39:03.000]  especially now after you sort of made that little joke.
[39:03.000 --> 39:07.000]  You know that I have DerryFirewall.com, right?
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  Yeah, but it redirects to.NET.
[39:09.000 --> 39:10.000]  Right.
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  And some people don't ask about that anymore.
[39:12.000 --> 39:13.000]  In the early years, people would be like,
[39:13.000 --> 39:16.000]  why do you redirect to.NET?
[39:16.000 --> 39:21.000]  Why don't most people, if they have both, redirect to.COM?
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  And I think it's like, to me,
[39:23.000 --> 39:27.000]  it's like I started using the internet so early
[39:27.000 --> 39:31.000]  when most domains weren't.COMs,
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  like.ORGs and.EDUs.
[39:33.000 --> 39:37.000] .EDUs were probably the most popular that I used
[39:37.000 --> 39:38.000]  and.NET too.
[39:38.000 --> 39:42.000]  But to me,.COM was sort of crass in the early years.
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.000]  And I know that after the doc,
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  I even called the bubble the.COM bubble.
[39:47.000 --> 39:52.000] .COM sort of became the neutral one, right?
[39:52.000 --> 39:55.000]  It's like ground zero of all the top-level domains.
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  By default, you want a.COM.
[39:57.000 --> 40:02.000]  But in my mind, it's still sort of crass.
[40:02.000 --> 40:03.000]  I don't know.
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.000]  In the early years, all the.COM sites were garbage.
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.000]  Right, it was supposed to be commercial, right?
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  I think that's what it stands for.
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.000]  I agree, I like.NET better.
[40:15.000 --> 40:18.000]  But yes, I give in to the prevailing.
[40:18.000 --> 40:19.000]  I own SirTucky.net also,
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  but it redirects in the opposite direction.
[40:21.000 --> 40:26.000]  Right, and like Kotki, I think a lot of early types,
[40:26.000 --> 40:27.000]  like me and Kotki.
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  I always did like Kotki.org, yeah.
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  And it wouldn't work.
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  It somehow is part of the domain.
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  Kotki.net wouldn't be right,
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  and Kotki.com would be awful.
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  It wouldn't be the same.
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  Kotki.org is exactly right.
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  And for whatever reason in my mind,
[40:43.000 --> 40:46.000]  it's just like when you rewrite a sentence
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  and just use the same words,
[40:48.000 --> 40:51.000]  but you put a clause in the middle of the sentence
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  as opposed to at the end or something like that.
[40:53.000 --> 40:54.000]  And one way it reads great,
[40:54.000 --> 40:55.000]  and one way it doesn't,
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  to me, daringfireball.net reads better
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  than daringfireball.com.
[40:59.000 --> 41:00.000]  I remember...
[41:00.000 --> 41:01.000]  Yeah, well, the great thing...
[41:01.000 --> 41:02.000]  Well, sorry.
[41:02.000 --> 41:03.000]  Go ahead, go ahead, Ben.
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.000]  Oh, no, I was just going to say,
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  the great thing about Daring Fireball
[41:06.000 --> 41:09.000]  is it's so distinct that you can,
[41:09.000 --> 41:12.000]  one, if you type in a URL,
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  and the thing is that no one actually types,
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  you know, us nerds do,
[41:16.000 --> 41:17.000]  but the vast majority of people
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  don't even type URLs.
[41:19.000 --> 41:23.000]  Like, Google has the whole, you know,
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  like, a huge number back in the day.
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  Like, they could track how popular Facebook was
[41:27.000 --> 41:28.000]  because by people, you know,
[41:28.000 --> 41:31.000]  typing Facebook into Google to go to Facebook.
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  So for normal people, it doesn't really register.
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  But that's the great thing about Daring Fireball.
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  Even if you do a URL or you do a Google search, whatever,
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  it's going to, it's memorable,
[41:39.000 --> 41:40.000]  and it's going to come up right away.
[41:40.000 --> 41:43.000]  Wasn't there a thing where...
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  Off the top of my head, I'm not remembering it right,
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  but there was a thing where the number one result
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.000]  for Facebook login was no longer the Facebook login page,
[41:51.000 --> 41:54.000]  and the poor bugger who had...
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  It was just some guy's site or something,
[41:56.000 --> 41:59.000]  and the guy was just inundated with thousands of people
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  saying, what have you done to Facebook?
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  This doesn't look like Facebook.
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  Do you remember this?
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  I don't, but that would be brutal.
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.000]  Right, because that's how people get
[42:09.000 --> 42:10.000]  to the Facebook login sign.
[42:10.000 --> 42:13.000]  They go to Google and then type Facebook login,
[42:13.000 --> 42:14.000]  and it returns.
[42:14.000 --> 42:17.000]  They all expect to be taken there.
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  Oh, funny stuff.
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  That's what my son gets around the internet.
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.000]  He just types stuff into Google.
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  Yeah, that's pretty normal.
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  I mean, that's pretty normal behavior.
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  I mean, if people, you know,
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  to the extent people are still using the internet,
[42:32.000 --> 42:38.000]  I mean, it really shows the extent to which Google
[42:38.000 --> 42:41.000]  is the sort of winchpin for the internet.
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  I mean, yes, you can type URLs to go to places,
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  but the reality is and the way that people
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.000]  actually experience online is through Google.
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  It's not just about like typing Facebook
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  into Google search page, but there's just so much stuff.
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.000]  There's so many things that it's, you know,
[42:58.000 --> 43:01.000]  incomprehensible to anyone, even the smartest person
[43:01.000 --> 43:03.000]  on earth, I mean.
[43:03.000 --> 43:06.000]  And Google, what makes Google so brilliant
[43:06.000 --> 43:09.000]  and such a brilliant sort of invention is that,
[43:09.000 --> 43:12.000]  you know, the old search engines,
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  the more stuff there was, the more they bogged down
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.000]  because they were, you know, I mean,
[43:16.000 --> 43:17.000]  the original Yahoo was literally a directory.
[43:17.000 --> 43:19.000]  I mean, obviously, the future search engines
[43:19.000 --> 43:21.000]  were much more sophisticated, but Google,
[43:21.000 --> 43:23.000]  by sort of building on top of the link
[43:23.000 --> 43:26.000]  instead of building on top of the pages themselves,
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  well, it turned out when you got more links,
[43:28.000 --> 43:31.000]  Google got smarter and understood it better
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.000]  and when the web got larger, everyone else got worse
[43:35.000 --> 43:37.000]  except for Google, which actually got even better.
[43:37.000 --> 43:41.000]  And that's, you know, that's sort of the core piece
[43:41.000 --> 43:45.000]  of the company's dominance and why they're the,
[43:45.000 --> 43:49.000]  you know, the winchpin for the entire internet.
[43:49.000 --> 43:53.000]  Which brings us to Windows 10 S
[43:53.000 --> 43:58.000]  and the way that, on Windows 10 S,
[43:58.000 --> 44:00.000]  you can't change your default search engine.
[44:00.000 --> 44:02.000]  You get Bing and you like it.
[44:02.000 --> 44:05.000]  Yeah, and I think that's, I believe they're giving away
[44:05.000 --> 44:09.000]  10 S to the OEM, so that's the primary way
[44:09.000 --> 44:11.000]  that they're going to, I mean, obviously,
[44:11.000 --> 44:14.000]  there's app sales as well, but app sales
[44:14.000 --> 44:17.000]  and Bing searches and stuff like that,
[44:17.000 --> 44:19.000]  I think Bing is actually profitable now
[44:19.000 --> 44:22.000]  or very close to it.
[44:22.000 --> 44:23.000]  For a little bit, actually.
[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  It should be, don't you think?
[44:25.000 --> 44:26.000]  I mean, it doesn't make sense
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.000]  that they'd keep losing money on it
[44:28.000 --> 44:31.000]  because, I mean, how much could it cost
[44:31.000 --> 44:34.000]  other than labor, you know, to keep going?
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  Yeah, it's one of those things
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.000]  where it's not like a winnier sort of thing
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  where they make a little more money,
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  a little more money, and that now they're profitable
[44:43.000 --> 44:44.000]  and they're growing.
[44:44.000 --> 44:45.000]  It's like you're either losing a lot
[44:45.000 --> 44:47.000]  or you're making a good amount,
[44:47.000 --> 44:49.000]  like once you get the sort of scale effects
[44:49.000 --> 44:52.000]  that are kicking in, but yeah,
[44:52.000 --> 44:55.000]  it's still actually growing pretty decently.
[44:55.000 --> 44:57.000]  I think 5.3 billion in revenue
[44:57.000 --> 44:58.000]  the last fiscal year.
[44:58.000 --> 44:59.000]  I should try it again.
[44:59.000 --> 45:01.000]  I haven't tried Bing in a while.
[45:01.000 --> 45:04.000]  On different Macs or different devices
[45:04.000 --> 45:06.000]  at any given time, I sometimes switch
[45:06.000 --> 45:08.000]  to DuckDuckGo, which I admire
[45:08.000 --> 45:11.000]  as the plucky little startup, you know,
[45:11.000 --> 45:13.000]  and they're local to Philly, too.
[45:13.000 --> 45:16.000]  It gives me a little affection for them,
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.000]  but I have to admit that there's a lot of times
[45:18.000 --> 45:22.000]  with DuckDuckGo where it's semi-free.
[45:22.000 --> 45:23.000]  Yeah, if you're gonna do it,
[45:23.000 --> 45:25.000]  at some point in the week,
[45:25.000 --> 45:27.000]  you're gonna be typing.
[45:27.000 --> 45:28.000]  There's a trick they have.
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  You can even type like G exclamation mark
[45:30.000 --> 45:31.000]  and it redoes the same query
[45:31.000 --> 45:33.000]  but redirects you to Google
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.000]  because there's just sometimes,
[45:35.000 --> 45:37.000]  it's not as good as Google search.
[45:37.000 --> 45:39.000]  I mean, they do some really cool stuff,
[45:39.000 --> 45:40.000]  and I like the privacy aspect of it,
[45:40.000 --> 45:41.000]  but it's not as good,
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  but the thing that surprises me is
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.000]  I thought Microsoft might catch up
[45:45.000 --> 45:46.000]  to Google search with Bing
[45:46.000 --> 45:49.000]  because it seems like the sort of problem
[45:49.000 --> 45:53.000]  that Microsoft would be able to solve.
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  It never surprises me that Microsoft software
[45:56.000 --> 45:59.000]  never has as nice of a UI as Apple software
[45:59.000 --> 46:00.000]  because it's, institutionally,
[46:00.000 --> 46:02.000]  they just don't have the people
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.000]  who have the taste for that,
[46:04.000 --> 46:07.000]  but web search is really just,
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  you don't have to have taste for that.
[46:09.000 --> 46:12.000]  It's a purely algorithmic challenge
[46:12.000 --> 46:13.000]  to get that right.
[46:13.000 --> 46:14.000]  Well, not quite.
[46:14.000 --> 46:15.000]  You need data.
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.000]  I mean, the thing with Google is
[46:19.000 --> 46:23.000]  the algorithm itself is far beyond
[46:23.000 --> 46:26.000]  any one person could,
[46:26.000 --> 46:28.000]  it was designed by a person to start,
[46:28.000 --> 46:30.000]  but at this point, it's so complex and convoluted,
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  and a lot of it is just constant iterative feedback,
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  so when people are doing searches,
[46:34.000 --> 46:37.000]  and I'm not talking about the individualized searches,
[46:37.000 --> 46:38.000]  just as a whole,
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  like which results are the quick,
[46:40.000 --> 46:41.000]  like Google wants the first,
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.000]  the proper result to be the first result,
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.000]  so they are tracking which result you actually click on,
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  where, how far down you go,
[46:47.000 --> 46:50.000]  and plus, websites are optimizing themselves for Google,
[46:50.000 --> 46:54.000]  and so Microsoft has to attach onto that,
[46:54.000 --> 46:55.000]  but it's one of those situations
[46:55.000 --> 46:57.000]  where thanks to the feedback loop
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.000]  that comes from having the most data
[46:59.000 --> 47:02.000]  and the most users and the most searches,
[47:02.000 --> 47:04.000]  if two identical search engines,
[47:04.000 --> 47:06.000]  if one starts at 51% market share
[47:06.000 --> 47:08.000]  and one starts at 49% market share,
[47:08.000 --> 47:11.000]  absent sort of any exterior force,
[47:11.000 --> 47:13.000]  the one with the 50% market share
[47:13.000 --> 47:15.000]  is going to get better over time
[47:15.000 --> 47:17.000]  relative to the other one,
[47:17.000 --> 47:19.000]  which means, and then when it gets better,
[47:19.000 --> 47:20.000]  that lets it get more users,
[47:20.000 --> 47:22.000]  because it's a better search engine,
[47:22.000 --> 47:24.000]  and then it gets even more data
[47:24.000 --> 47:25.000]  relative to the competition,
[47:25.000 --> 47:27.000]  so it even has a bigger advantage,
[47:27.000 --> 47:29.000]  so the reality is even,
[47:29.000 --> 47:30.000]  Microsoft can have the smartest
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  sort of search folks in the world,
[47:32.000 --> 47:33.000]  but because it's a problem
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.000]  that's not just about algorithm design,
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  it's about the entire sort of system
[47:38.000 --> 47:40.000]  and having iterative feedback loop,
[47:40.000 --> 47:45.000]  it's very difficult to ever catch up
[47:45.000 --> 47:49.000]  absent some sort of incredible breakthrough.
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  You can't buy your way out of technology.
[47:51.000 --> 47:52.000]  There's no way to throw any money at it.
[47:52.000 --> 47:53.000]  Right, exactly.
[47:53.000 --> 47:54.000]  It doesn't get you there.
[47:54.000 --> 47:55.000]  That's interesting.
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  To me, it has to be the explanation,
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.000]  because I don't think the problem
[48:00.000 --> 48:03.000]  is that Microsoft doesn't have the intelligence
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  and the engineering to do it,
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.000]  and they obviously had no problem
[48:08.000 --> 48:09.000]  spending money on it.
[48:09.000 --> 48:10.000]  For years, famously,
[48:10.000 --> 48:13.000]  they were losing billions on Bing.
[48:13.000 --> 48:14.000]  I think that's just it, though,
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  that Google's so popular
[48:16.000 --> 48:19.000]  that their popularity
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  feeds upon their accuracy,
[48:21.000 --> 48:24.000]  or their accuracy feeds upon their popularity.
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  And this is where Google is, in some respects,
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  it's like a Facebook effect,
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  but there is a sort of network effect,
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  but it's not necessarily about people, per se.
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  It's the interaction between people
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  and the sort of data they generate,
[48:36.000 --> 48:37.000]  but you get the same sort of idea
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  where the larger service...
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.000]  I always write a lot about user experience,
[48:43.000 --> 48:46.000]  and I sometimes forget to make this,
[48:46.000 --> 48:47.000]  and when I forget to make this point,
[48:47.000 --> 48:48.000]  I always regret it,
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  because I get a bunch of people
[48:50.000 --> 48:51.000]  asking questions.
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  User experience does not mean user interface.
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  User interface is an important part
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  of the user experience,
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  and is critical for something like a phone,
[48:59.000 --> 49:00.000]  for example, that's in your hand
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  and you're interacting with.
[49:02.000 --> 49:05.000]  Actually, if we talk about WeChat stuff,
[49:05.000 --> 49:06.000]  we can talk about this in a little bit,
[49:06.000 --> 49:09.000]  but the user experience is the totality
[49:09.000 --> 49:10.000]  of the experience,
[49:10.000 --> 49:13.000]  which means having better search results
[49:13.000 --> 49:14.000]  means it's a better experience.
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  Having more friends on Facebook,
[49:16.000 --> 49:17.000]  more family on Facebook,
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  not having to try to recruit people
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.000]  to get on there means it's a better experience
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  that has nothing to do with the interface, per se,
[49:24.000 --> 49:27.000]  and these aspects of the experience,
[49:27.000 --> 49:28.000]  they build on themselves,
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  and this is why you have these companies
[49:30.000 --> 49:31.000]  that are so dominant,
[49:31.000 --> 49:32.000]  and what makes it so tricky,
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  and I've been writing a lot about this
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  over the last year or so,
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  these companies are so powerful
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  because of these data effects
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.000]  and these network effects,
[49:41.000 --> 49:42.000]  and they're powerful in a way
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  that's actually better for the consumer.
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.000]  Google is popular because it's better,
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  which means it gets more users,
[49:49.000 --> 49:50.000]  and when it gets more users,
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  it actually becomes even better,
[49:52.000 --> 49:56.000]  which means it's positive on the user perspective,
[49:56.000 --> 49:57.000]  and same thing with Facebook.
[49:57.000 --> 49:58.000]  It has the most users,
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.000]  so more people join it because it's there,
[50:01.000 --> 50:02.000]  and the more people join it,
[50:02.000 --> 50:03.000]  now it has more users,
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  and you get the same sort of feedback loop
[50:05.000 --> 50:08.000]  where people choose it because it's better,
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  and that sort of makes,
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  from an antitrust perspective,
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  that makes sort of US antitrust law
[50:14.000 --> 50:15.000]  fall completely apart
[50:15.000 --> 50:18.000]  because it's based on consumer benefit,
[50:18.000 --> 50:19.000]  and there's actually,
[50:19.000 --> 50:20.000]  they're providing a ton of consumer benefit.
[50:20.000 --> 50:21.000]  That's why they're winning.
[50:21.000 --> 50:22.000]  Right.
[50:25.000 --> 50:26.000]  Sorry, that was a summary
[50:26.000 --> 50:27.000]  of like 50 Instagram articles
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  that I've been writing about.
[50:29.000 --> 50:33.000]  Did you see the story that, I think The Verge had it,
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  that the Surface laptop,
[50:35.000 --> 50:38.000]  now the most unique thing about these Surface laptops
[50:38.000 --> 50:39.000]  that they announced is that
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  other than the keyboard and the trackpad,
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  what you touch on the front face
[50:43.000 --> 50:48.000]  is like a soft touch, leather,
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  like fake leather type thing,
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  but it's like a, it's called Alkantara.
[50:52.000 --> 50:53.000]  Which looks awful to me, but.
[50:53.000 --> 50:56.000]  Alkantara, apparently a lot of car makers
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  use it, high-end car makers.
[50:58.000 --> 51:01.000]  Well, I don't want to judge it on Photos,
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  but from the Photos, to me it looks terrible.
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  I would not want that.
[51:05.000 --> 51:08.000]  I wouldn't, if I had the choice when buying a laptop,
[51:08.000 --> 51:11.000]  whether I just have a bare aluminum Surface
[51:11.000 --> 51:14.000]  or like, no pun intended, Surface,
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  or have it covered with this stuff,
[51:16.000 --> 51:17.000]  without having seen it in person,
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  I would, zero hesitation,
[51:19.000 --> 51:20.000]  I would just say, just give me the aluminum.
[51:20.000 --> 51:23.000]  This seems like a disaster.
[51:23.000 --> 51:24.000]  Yeah.
[51:24.000 --> 51:27.000]  But I saw people excoriating Microsoft
[51:27.000 --> 51:30.000]  for having told the Verge
[51:30.000 --> 51:36.000]  that you need to treat it like a luxury purse
[51:36.000 --> 51:40.000]  or something like that, or a luxury handbag.
[51:40.000 --> 51:44.000]  And I think people took that as meaning
[51:44.000 --> 51:46.000]  that it's like dainty,
[51:46.000 --> 51:47.000]  and that it's, you're like,
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.000]  you have to treat it preciously.
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  I think that's how people reacted to this,
[51:51.000 --> 51:52.000]  like the headline, I think.
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  Microsoft says the fabric on the Surface laptop
[51:54.000 --> 51:58.000]  should be cared for like a luxury handbag.
[51:58.000 --> 52:01.000]  And I think the Verge did a disservice with that headline
[52:01.000 --> 52:04.000]  because it's not really, that's not a quote.
[52:04.000 --> 52:08.000]  The only quote in that headline is the word luxury.
[52:08.000 --> 52:11.000]  Here's the actual statement from Microsoft.
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  I hate this use of the word luxury.
[52:13.000 --> 52:16.000]  Just like anything luxury that you buy,
[52:16.000 --> 52:19.000]  that should be luxurious or something,
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  or any luxury product that you buy.
[52:21.000 --> 52:24.000]  But it's still, it seems self-serving for them
[52:24.000 --> 52:25.000]  to describe it as luxury.
[52:25.000 --> 52:28.000]  But anyway, just like anything luxury that you buy,
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  like great handbags or a pair of shoes
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  or even expensive cars,
[52:32.000 --> 52:37.000]  there is a care that's needed for the device.
[52:37.000 --> 52:40.000]  So I think there has to be some care for it.
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  But I think the thing that people aren't,
[52:42.000 --> 52:46.000]  maybe you and I understand it with our spouses,
[52:46.000 --> 52:51.000]  but you can get, there are handbags that are,
[52:52.000 --> 52:54.000]  might be from a luxury brand,
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  and they're not really dainty.
[52:56.000 --> 52:57.000]  They're actually the opposite.
[52:57.000 --> 53:02.000]  They're actually very, they're built to last for decades.
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  And you do have to treat leather,
[53:04.000 --> 53:05.000]  and if you get it wet,
[53:05.000 --> 53:08.000]  you have to take care of it right away and stuff like that.
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  But they actually hold up surprisingly well.
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  They're not dainty little Faberg eggs.
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.000]  They're actually much more rugged in some ways
[53:15.000 --> 53:20.000]  than typical lower cost bags.
[53:20.000 --> 53:21.000]  So that's-
[53:21.000 --> 53:25.000]  Sometimes you buy a nice bag or a nice pair of shoes
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  that are luxury, but you buy them
[53:27.000 --> 53:31.000]  because they last way longer and hold up much better
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  and age much more attractively
[53:33.000 --> 53:36.000]  than something that's lower cost.
[53:36.000 --> 53:37.000]  Right.
[53:37.000 --> 53:41.000]  There was a weird Twitter account I was into for a while.
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  It was one of those ones that was interesting
[53:43.000 --> 53:44.000]  only when it was anonymous
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.000]  and when somebody figured out who the guy was.
[53:46.000 --> 53:47.000]  It was no fun anymore.
[53:47.000 --> 53:48.000]  GS Elevator.
[53:48.000 --> 53:49.000]  Remember that?
[53:49.000 --> 53:50.000]  It was-
[53:50.000 --> 53:51.000]  Oh, yeah.
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  It was written from the perspective
[53:53.000 --> 53:57.000]  of stuff overheard in the elevators at Goldman Sachs.
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  And it was often hilarious,
[53:59.000 --> 54:02.000]  often very rude, sort of from that-
[54:02.000 --> 54:03.000]  Very lewd.
[54:03.000 --> 54:09.000]  That bro, alpha male banker mentality.
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  But I remember the guy who wrote it had,
[54:12.000 --> 54:15.000]  he also had articles and it was just like,
[54:15.000 --> 54:18.000]  all right, so you got a job in an investment bank.
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.000]  You're a kid out of college.
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.000]  Here's the clothes that you need to buy.
[54:22.000 --> 54:25.000]  And one of his things was that you should get,
[54:25.000 --> 54:29.000]  I forget if he recommended Gucci or what,
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  but something like get a nice pair of Gucci shoes.
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.000]  Yes, they're $800 or $700,
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  but they will last you way longer
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.000]  than 10 pairs of $200 shoes if you take care of them.
[54:41.000 --> 54:42.000]  Right.
[54:42.000 --> 54:43.000]  Yep.
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  There's obviously some things that are luxury priced
[54:45.000 --> 54:48.000]  that are not, that you're just throwing,
[54:48.000 --> 54:49.000]  like a sports car.
[54:49.000 --> 54:50.000]  If you buy a Lamborghini,
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  you're just pissing money away.
[54:52.000 --> 54:55.000]  It's not really, you're not really buying it
[54:55.000 --> 54:59.000]  for the value of, I mean, the car is valuable,
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  but it's not like you're not going to sink
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  tens of thousands of dollars in it maintenance as you go.
[55:03.000 --> 55:06.000]  Nobody buys a Lamborghini because it's worth it-
[55:06.000 --> 55:07.000]  It's a good investment.
[55:07.000 --> 55:12.000]  Reliability-wise compared to a Honda.
[55:12.000 --> 55:13.000]  Yep.
[55:13.000 --> 55:14.000]  But there are some things like a nice shoe
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  or a nice belt or something like that
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  where you actually, yes, you're paying a lot of money,
[55:18.000 --> 55:21.000]  but it's actually, you might be paying five times more
[55:21.000 --> 55:22.000]  than what you're used to,
[55:22.000 --> 55:25.000]  but you're actually getting like 10 times better product.
[55:25.000 --> 55:28.000]  I don't think that the Surface laptop is like that though.
[55:28.000 --> 55:29.000]  I don't know.
[55:29.000 --> 55:30.000]  Yeah.
[55:30.000 --> 55:33.000]  Yeah, I wouldn't have used that word choice.
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  And yeah, now that I'm looking at that
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  just like anything luxury, that's driving me up the wall.
[55:37.000 --> 55:38.000]  That's terrible.
[55:38.000 --> 55:39.000]  They have to.
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  They have to have tested this.
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  I know like last week on the show,
[55:43.000 --> 55:46.000]  Rene and I were joking about that the iPad,
[55:46.000 --> 55:49.000]  or iPod that came, I think it was like an iPod Nano
[55:49.000 --> 55:51.000]  that was super easily scratched.
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  Do you remember that one?
[55:53.000 --> 55:54.000]  It was the original, the original Nano.
[55:54.000 --> 55:58.000]  Yeah, it was almost in a, you know, I would love,
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  it's one of those like behind the scenes things.
[56:00.000 --> 56:03.000]  I would love to someday get that story out of Apple
[56:03.000 --> 56:07.000]  as to how in the hell did they make tens of thousands
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  of these things or half a million of these things
[56:09.000 --> 56:13.000]  out of a plastic that you scratch with your fingernail?
[56:13.000 --> 56:14.000]  Like what the hell were they thinking?
[56:14.000 --> 56:17.000]  How did that not get caught in testing?
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  I know, because I mean, if you saw one,
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  like they within not long, I mean,
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  they would be just completely destroyed
[56:23.000 --> 56:26.000]  like to the point where you could barely even read the screen.
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  In the whole, it was the whole front, not just the screen.
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  Like the entire Surface would be,
[56:30.000 --> 56:34.000]  would be just completely, yeah, all shredded up.
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  Yeah, it's hard to remember compared to iPhones
[56:36.000 --> 56:39.000]  where everything is so much closer to the Surface now.
[56:39.000 --> 56:42.000]  But with the iPods, even with the Nano,
[56:42.000 --> 56:45.000]  there was sort of a thick layer of screen
[56:45.000 --> 56:48.000]  or not even screen, but just plastic on the whole front
[56:48.000 --> 56:52.000]  of all these models or a bunch of them.
[56:52.000 --> 56:55.000]  I remember we got them when I was working at Joyent.
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  I forget, we hit some kind of milestone or something.
[56:57.000 --> 57:02.000]  And so everybody in the company got one as a gift.
[57:02.000 --> 57:06.000]  And in our company, like chat,
[57:06.000 --> 57:07.000]  I forget what we even used for chat.
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  It wasn't Slack, obviously it wasn't around,
[57:09.000 --> 57:10.000]  but the equivalent of Slack.
[57:10.000 --> 57:11.000]  IRC.
[57:11.000 --> 57:12.000]  It wasn't IRC, though.
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  I forget what we were using, but...
[57:14.000 --> 57:15.000]  Hip, hip, hip chat.
[57:15.000 --> 57:16.000]  And that was a long time ago, too.
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  Yeah, I don't remember.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  I don't know why I'm drawing a blank on that,
[57:20.000 --> 57:21.000]  but we had like a company-wide chat
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  and when everybody got these and we're like,
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  everybody was having fun with their new iPod
[57:25.000 --> 57:28.000]  and it took like an hour for people to be like,
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  holy shit, mine's all scratched up.
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  Yup.
[57:32.000 --> 57:35.000]  2005, man, it's already been 12 years.
[57:35.000 --> 57:38.000]  I can't help but think that Microsoft had to have
[57:38.000 --> 57:42.000]  stress tested these things with actual sweaty palms
[57:42.000 --> 57:49.000]  and use this for a while, maybe have us in a warm room
[57:49.000 --> 57:52.000]  with somebody who sweats through their palms or something.
[57:52.000 --> 57:56.000]  These things can't just pick up ugly palm sweat stains.
[57:56.000 --> 58:00.000]  Yeah, I'm not sure I want to admit to this,
[58:00.000 --> 58:03.000]  but even my MacBook is always the keyboard
[58:03.000 --> 58:06.000]  and that all ends up just totally filthy.
[58:06.000 --> 58:07.000]  It's pretty disgusting, actually.
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.000]  I should probably clean it.
[58:09.000 --> 58:10.000]  Yeah, you probably should.
[58:10.000 --> 58:12.000]  That's gross, Ben.
[58:12.000 --> 58:13.000]  I don't know.
[58:13.000 --> 58:14.000]  It just doesn't seem like...
[58:14.000 --> 58:15.000]  The more I think about it,
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  this just doesn't seem like a good idea.
[58:17.000 --> 58:18.000]  I don't know.
[58:18.000 --> 58:21.000]  It just seems too many laptops get too grungy,
[58:21.000 --> 58:25.000]  as is, as easy to clean a surface as aluminum is.
[58:25.000 --> 58:27.000]  I mean, it's pretty hard to think of something
[58:27.000 --> 58:29.000]  that's easier to clean than that.
[58:29.000 --> 58:31.000]  Everyone just wants them to make a nice laptop.
[58:31.000 --> 58:33.000]  That's all they want, just a regular...
[58:33.000 --> 58:35.000]  So they did the Surface Book thing,
[58:35.000 --> 58:37.000]  or first they did the Surface and the Surface Book thing,
[58:37.000 --> 58:41.000]  and now there's a laptop, but yeah, it has...
[58:41.000 --> 58:43.000]  But I know there's lots of politics
[58:43.000 --> 58:45.000]  and competing with OEMs, all that sort of stuff,
[58:45.000 --> 58:53.000]  but yeah, I'd rather get a ThinkPad with the nub anyway.
[58:53.000 --> 58:54.000]  I'd...
[58:54.000 --> 58:55.000]  A nub.
[58:55.000 --> 58:56.000]  A nub.
[58:56.000 --> 58:58.000]  I mean, I think it's so different.
[58:58.000 --> 58:59.000]  I don't know.
[58:59.000 --> 59:00.000]  Didn't they use it in the old days?
[59:00.000 --> 59:01.000]  It was like the nub was the only thing, right?
[59:01.000 --> 59:03.000]  They didn't even have a trackpad.
[59:03.000 --> 59:05.000]  Yep, it used to be just the nub,
[59:05.000 --> 59:07.000]  but yeah, they have both now.
[59:07.000 --> 59:09.000]  That's almost like an Apple devotion,
[59:09.000 --> 59:11.000]  like Apple's devotion to the single button mouse
[59:11.000 --> 59:14.000]  in a world where everybody went the other way,
[59:14.000 --> 59:18.000]  the old IBM ThinkPad's devotion to the little red nub.
[59:18.000 --> 59:20.000]  Yeah, well, I mean, if you...
[59:20.000 --> 59:22.000]  There's lots of people that...
[59:22.000 --> 59:25.000]  Relatively speaking, not a ton, but there are...
[59:25.000 --> 59:27.000]  People like it.
[59:27.000 --> 59:29.000]  If you're used to it, it's one of those things
[59:29.000 --> 59:31.000]  where if you really like it,
[59:31.000 --> 59:33.000]  why would you...
[59:33.000 --> 59:35.000]  You're going to just keep buying ThinkPads.
[59:35.000 --> 59:36.000]  You're not even going to think about it.
[59:36.000 --> 59:38.000]  And I think part of the problem, too,
[59:38.000 --> 59:40.000]  is touchpads have always been so terrible on Windows.
[59:40.000 --> 59:41.000]  Right.
[59:41.000 --> 59:42.000]  So terrible.
[59:42.000 --> 59:43.000]  That was the big reason.
[59:43.000 --> 59:44.000]  Yeah, that was one of the big reasons
[59:44.000 --> 59:46.000]  that when I was using...
[59:46.000 --> 59:48.000]  When I was at Microsoft, I used the ThinkPad.
[59:48.000 --> 59:51.000]  And that was the biggest reason
[59:51.000 --> 59:53.000]  I started using the nub in the first place,
[59:53.000 --> 59:54.000]  that the trackpad was atrocious.
[59:54.000 --> 59:56.000]  But then you use it,
[59:56.000 --> 59:58.000]  and you actually grow to really, really like it.
[59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000]  Not having to...
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000]  I mean, you're absolutely used to it moving.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000]  You don't move your hand much on a computer,
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000]  but on a MacBook.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  But just having it right there.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  Once you're used to it, it's nice.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  Yeah, it's great.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000]  It's giving them an actual differentiation.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  It's in a world...
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000]  The big problem that PC OEMs have
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000]  is that what's to keep...
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000]  Let's say you sell somebody an HP laptop.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  What's to keep them from buying a different brand
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  the next time they buy one?
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  Nothing, really.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  And the little red nubbin
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  is actually a little bit of a differentiator,
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  if they have the muscle memory for it.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  Yep.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  I always thought they were weird.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  Anyway.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  What else do you want to talk about
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  before we get to the...
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  To the WeChat thing?
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  Yeah.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  Well, I actually think we've,
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  through talking about various things,
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  have set the stage nicely.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  What do you think about the two new Echos?
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  Oh, yeah.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  There's the camera one,
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  and then there's the one with the screen.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  Well, let's talk about that
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  after I thank another one of our friends.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  It's our good friend, a new sponsor.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  First time.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  I really like this company, though.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  Pingdom. P-I-N-G-D-O-M.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  It's a service for monitoring websites and servers.

[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  Pingdom.com slash LP slash talk show.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  And they have a nice little landing page there
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  for listeners of the show addressed just to you.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  You get a 14-day free trial,

[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  you get 20% off your first invoice.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  That's a big deal.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  20%.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  Pingdom makes the web faster
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  and more reliable for everyone
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  by offering powerful, easy-to-use monitoring tools
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  and services for anyone on the website.

[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  It's really great.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  So you've got a web server.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  You can just point something to it,
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  and they can, like, simulate visits.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  It's not just, like, a ping to the server,
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  even though that's their name,
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  but they can actually simulate an actual visit to the website,
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  and you can write tests to make sure certain components...
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  And modern websites have so many things
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  where you're drawing things from multiple services
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  to make your website,
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  where it's not just one server that can go down.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  There's all sorts of fail points along the way,
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  and you can write these tests with Pingdom
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  to test if everything that you expect to be working is working,
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  and when it's not, they'll notify you instantly.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  Pingdom detects more than 13 million outages,
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  more than 400,000 outages every day.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  Wow.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  And, you know, if you've ever noticed,
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  stuff actually breaks on the Internet all the time.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  Here's a way to find out if your stuff broke.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  Really great service used by a whole bunch of big names.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  If you go to their website, I told you pingdom.com
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  slash LP slash talk show, and just look at the big names
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  that use Pingdom for monitoring their service,
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  servers and websites.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  It's amazing.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  So go there and check them out,
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  and they will know you came from the show,
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  and remember that code, the talk show,
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  and you'll save 20% on your first invoice.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  My thanks to Pingdom.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  Great, great service.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  Yeah, so Amazon, they have two new...
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  What do they call them?
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  Echo products?
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  They both...
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  Yeah, there's the Echo Look, which is just a camera,
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  and then there's the...
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  They're pitching it for putting in your closet or wardrobe,
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  and then the Echo...
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  The bigger...
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  Probably the one they made a bigger splash about
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  was the Echo Show, which has a screen.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  It says, now Echo can show you things,
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  I believe is the tagline.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  Right, and obviously also has a camera,
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  since it does, like, photo, video calls.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  Right, which I actually think is the most...
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  The most interesting part of it,
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  and it really featured very heavily
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  in the introductory video.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  Yeah, I have to watch that again,
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  but it did seem like it's almost more like...
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  The bigger announcement is that they're doing their own...
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  They don't have a name for it, though, right?
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  They don't have a name like FaceTime.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  Right.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  No, it's just...
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  It's not just the Echo Show,
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  because they updated the Alexa app,
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  and so you can go between phones and the Echo Show,
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  or Echo Show to Echo Show.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  I don't know for sure if you can go phone to phone,
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  but I presume you can.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  I wrote about it yesterday.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  I wrote that I presume you can,
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  and I was going to look it up,
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  and then I don't remember if I actually looked it up.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  Right.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  But it is basically a FaceTime competitor
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  without being called a FaceTime competitor,
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  but that's certainly what it is.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  Well, it's...
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  Yeah, so the trick to the whole thing
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  is that they've updated the phone app
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  for, I guess, Android and iOS.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  I know the iOS one's updated,
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  where both for you to have one of these calls
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000]  with somebody who doesn't own an Echo,
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  or who would want to use this
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  if you had to be in the room
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000]  where your Echo is to get the call.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  It's like all of a sudden you're back to landline days
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  where you've got a quick run to the kitchen
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  to take a phone call.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  That's not going to fly.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000]  Well, yeah, but I remember the...
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  When the Echo first came along,
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  it was the original introductory video,
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000]  which unfortunately has been taken down,
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  but it was super corny,
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000]  and I remember a lot of people made fun of it,
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  but actually I kind of liked it because it was...
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000]  And you can see the same thing in the new Echo Show video,
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000]  which is it's very sort of...
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000]  There's no fancy marketing commercial stuff going on here.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000]  It's very straightforward,
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000]  showing people explicit use cases for this product
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000]  and people going through these use cases.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000]  The dad is changing the baby's diaper,
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000]  and he's ordering new diapers.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000]  It's not subtle at all.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  But I kind of like that.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000]  You're not limited to a 30-second grab.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  You're not trying to instill sort of...
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  I think there's a mistake
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000]  a lot of marketers in tech have traditionally made
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000]  is they hire these branding agencies,
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000]  especially in the early days of tech,
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  these branding agencies that were used to doing
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  consumer goods, consumer packaged goods,
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  and there it's all about building brand affinity
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  because the goal is when someone's in a store
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  and they're faced with 15 options for crackers,
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  that they choose one, or the owner or whatever it might be,
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  they choose one,
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  and they don't really know why they chose it.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  They just do.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  And that's the payoff of all that advertising
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  and branding and all that sort of stuff.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  With tech products, it's much more of a deliberate choice.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  So to use sort of brand-type marketing,
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  I think is much inferior to just showing it,
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  showing how it works.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  I mean, this is something...
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  Some of my favorite Apple ads, actually,
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  were the original iPhone ads,
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  not the first one like the hello, hello
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  at the Academy Awards,
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  but all the ads after that for the first year.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  They were just showing people using the phone.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  The ones with Bob Bircher, I think his name was, right?
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000]  Yeah, and at the very end, the phone would ring.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  So they'd show them reading the New York Times,
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  they'd show them scrolling, playing a game,
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  or not playing a game, but doing stuff on the phone
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  that you could do on the phone,
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  and then at the very end of the commercial,
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  and it's the same one every time,
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  the phone would ring, say, oh, and it's a phone.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  And it was so effective both in explaining
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  what the iPhone is,
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  they were also teaching people how to use it.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  One of some of my favorite commercials,
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  just because I think the way they really...
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  It was a new way of doing commercials
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  that I think was much better for a tech product,
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000]  and something that I was always very frustrated by
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  when I was at Microsoft,
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000]  because I thought so many of the commercials
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  were in this CPG-branding mindset
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000]  when you're selling a very different kind of product.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000]  Yeah, those iPhone commercials were brilliant
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  because they were fast.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000]  I mean, they were 30-second spots,
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000]  but they showed things, and they...
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  They showed it. They showed the product.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  Right, but it was like real things,
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  and they're like, look, maybe you don't believe it.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  Maybe you hear somebody saying,
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  you know, you can get maps on your phone now
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  on these iPhones.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  You can get a usable map.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  But they'd show it.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  They'd say, here, look, type Starbucks,
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  and hit one button.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  Very easy.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  It just says, you know, like, search or whatever,
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  and then a map shows up
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  showing how far you are from Starbucks
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  or whatever the example was in the commercial.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  Yep, yep, exactly.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  Yeah, the map one was a big one,
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  and it was so immediately became apparent
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  what the value was to people, right?
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  Right.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  Yeah, and this is something you can understand.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  Like, Apple understood that...
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  It sounds funny, but it's the thing
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  that I think a lot of tech people,
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  even tech marketers overlook
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  is that you tell a lot of people,
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  okay, you've got a cell phone.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  We know that.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  We know you're frustrated by it.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  We know that you probably can't figure out
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  how to do anything on it
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  other than make the phone calls.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  We're trying to sell you a phone that does...
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  It browses the web, gets your email,
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  has maps, lets you watch YouTube videos.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  But trust us, none of this is more complicated,
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  and making phone calls is even easier
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  than it was on your old phone.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  Yep.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  Yeah, it's exactly right.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  So, I mean, these Amazon Echo spots
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  are not like that,
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  and they're not nearly as highly produced.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  And they're still pretty corny.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  But if you're showing a product,
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  a $200 product,
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  and the original Echo, I think, was the same.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  I think it was $99 for Prime members.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  But people are on your...
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  You're on the web.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  You have infinite space.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  You can show as short or long a video as you want.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  You're not limited to 30 seconds.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  And people are being deliberate about their choice.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  Why not take advantage of that
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  and actually show how this product might be useful?
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  And I think that's something
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  they've done pretty consistently with these,
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  and I think it's smart.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  I think it's a much better way
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  to think about marketing your product,
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  because you're marketing a different kind of product
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  in a different context,
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  particularly for Amazon,
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  because they have a big website that they can use.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  Yeah, I know that the...
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  I'm going to get the name wrong.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  I can't remember these right,
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  because there's weird...
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  Like, the Echo Show and Echo Look,
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  but it's like, to me...
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  Echo Dot is the little one.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  Well, Echo Show is the one with the TV set,
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  and Echo Look is the one that's for your dressing room.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  Right.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  But you could call it...
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  It's one of those things where...
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  All right, Echo Look is the one that is a camera,
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  and you show it, you get dressed,
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  and you get a selfie,
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  and you can get some kind of analysis
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  as to whether your shoes match your belt or whatever.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  But just the name, Echo Look,
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  it could also mean the thing that you look at,
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  the thing with the screen, right?
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  And Echo Show, which is the one with the screen,
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  that could be the name of the one that's the camera.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  Like, here, Echo, let me show you what I'm wearing, right?
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  Yeah, I would call the other one...
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  This is just called Echo Camera.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  I think so, too, because then it's clear.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  That's what it is, right.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000]  And I think the whole, like, gives you tips on what you wear.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  I always feel like they put that in for the tech geeks.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  I mean, the reality is,
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  like, this whole, like, taking pictures of your outfit
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  is a huge thing, like, a massive thing,
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  and people do it every day,
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  and they mostly do it by holding out their arm
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  and taking a selfie or staying in front of a mirror
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  and snapping a picture.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  Like, it's a massive, massive, massive thing.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  So I think that's clearly what this product is focused on,
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  and that's the point of it.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  And, I mean, maybe in the long run,
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  it will be useful to, like, do the sort of AI stuff,
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  but I almost feel like that was, like, throwing a bone
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  to all the tech geeks, saying, like,
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  oh, and there's this thing, too.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  It's a selfie camera.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  Like, that's what it is,
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  and that's not to belittle it,
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  because that is a massive market,
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  and it's a massive market that's really interesting.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  There's lots of stuff about, like,
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  retail and retail changing,
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  and one of the big drivers of this is social media,
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  and on social media, it used to be, back in the day,
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  like, what drove fashion was it was all a status thing, right?
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  You want to go, and you go to the mall,
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  and you buy the high-status items,
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  and then you would wear them to school or whatever.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  Now, it's much more about standing out,
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  popping on social media, and variety,
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  and having something interesting and different
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  is much more important, and I think,
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  and this is playing into that.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  I laugh because you said you wear it to school or whatever,
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  and I know exactly why you said that,
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  and I think I even know why you hesitated after saying it,
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  is I think you had the same thought
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  that I had did as you said it,
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  is you're talking from the perspective
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  of me and you, two guys in our 40s,
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  because when retail was the only way to buy clothes,
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  that's when you and I were in school,
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  and by the time we got out of school,
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  that was when the internet was a thing,
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  and I had the same thought.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  It's like, well, yeah, back in the days
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  when you used to have to buy all your clothes at the mall,
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  you'd wear them to school.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  Everybody wore them to school,
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  but of course, there were generations of adults ahead of us
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  who wore them to other places.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  Yeah, but it is funny.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  It's always hard to, or you have to be super,
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  you're right, because the hesitation
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  was the snap of self-awareness.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  I'm probably over-personalizing this experience,
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  but you do see this traditional brands
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  that dominated malls, and they're all struggling mightily,
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  and you see other things,
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  like there's this other websites and services
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  that are much more inexpensive,
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  and it's much more about having something unique
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  and different as opposed to having
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  the same branded t-shirt as everybody else.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  I saw a thing that,
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  I think the New York Times just had a story
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  that J. Crew is in financial distress.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  I think Gap is, too.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  There's companies that would like it.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  Yeah, Edward Grumman and Fitch, all of them are struggling.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  Right, and you thought, well,
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  Abercrombie & Fitch was always a little bit more niche
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  because they had the, it smells weird,
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  and it purposely made an unwelcoming front.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  It's actually kind of an interesting retail strategy
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  where they kind of made the front of their stores
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  sort of hard to get into.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  Like I said, having a big wide opening,
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  they would just have a door, and it was sort of,
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  like they wanted, totally contrary to most retailers,
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  but it was sort of like they only wanted
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  the right people to come in,
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  young people who were shopping for Abercrombie clothes.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  But anyway, the Gap to me is more of the universal,
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  my God, everybody can go in the Gap
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  and find something that they would consider wearing.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  It's weird that they're having, not weird,
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  but it's obviously like a foundation of American retail
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  is crumbling if stores like that aren't doing well.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  Here's a question for you.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  Do you ever, when you feel like you need some new shirts,
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  do you go out and buy shirts in a retail store,
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  or do you buy everything online?
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  I usually, every summer, I go and just buy a ton of stuff.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  Actually, we always, it's a thing,
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  because my brother lives in Minneapolis,
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  and so we always go there and see my brother,
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  and then one day we go to the Mall of America,
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  and there's no sales tax on clothing there,
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  and everything's there,
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  and we just spend one day buying, or at least I do,
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  try to buy all the clothes I need for the entire year.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  Would I do need things otherwise?
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  Yeah, I go to department stores here.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  I don't buy online.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  But I mean, everything online here
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  is mostly in Chinese and whatnot,
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  and it's obviously a little more difficult,
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  but my wife buys a ton of stuff online.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  She buys stuff online all the time.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  My wife buys everything online, almost everything.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  I can't even recall the last time
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  she went out shopping for clothes.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000]  She just buys everything online,
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  and unlike me, she's not afraid to send stuff back.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  That's my problem.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  I just don't like packing stuff up to send back.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  It's irrational.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  It's completely irrational,
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000]  and it's not like I've amassed all these,
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000]  like a big pile of clothes that I don't like
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  or that don't fit,
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  that I just suck the, just eat the cost of it
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  because I don't send it,
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  but it's why I don't buy stuff like shirts.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  If I was gonna buy a dress shirt, I don't buy it online.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  Unless I know, if I know that there's a shirt
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000]  from Banana Republic, that I already have one,
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  and I know the exact size,
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  and I can judge from the picture
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  exactly what this one looks like,
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  I would buy that online,
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  but that's because I've actually tried it on.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  Yeah, I'm the same way.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  Yes, it's a hassle to get in the car
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  and go to the store or however you get to the store,
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  but for me, that sort of hassle doesn't register,
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  whereas having a bunch of boxes
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000]  and having to pack stuff up and put it out,
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  that just sounds like absolute torture to me.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  Even if you were to actually go through
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  and add up the number of minutes that it takes, it's less.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000]  The feeling of it is much worse,
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  so I'm completely with you.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  But for stuff like underwear and socks and stuff like that,
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  I don't think I've bought anything like that
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  in a retail store in 10 years.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  I mean, why would you?
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  It's crazy.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000]  If you feel like you need some new underwear, boom.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  Just click a couple buttons, and it's at your house.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  The Amazon Apparel thing is very interesting
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000]  because they've not announced any numbers about it,
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  but there's sort of hints that it's actually doing
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000]  much better than you think,
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000]  and they're growing really rapidly.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000]  I suspect a lot of it is probably things like you just said,
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  basics and whatnot,
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  but at a minimum, they're for sure making
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000]  massive investments in it,
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  like just huge, not just the Amazon look,
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  although I think that is interesting in that regard,
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000]  but they have all kinds of interesting projects going on.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  They've launched multiple brands,
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  you know, their brands, for different sort of categories.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  They own Zappos.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  Yeah, but this is all in Amazon itself.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  I think it's not, the Zappos thing was,
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  I think they bought them because they were doing well
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  and they're an e-commerce site,
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000]  and so they wanted to take them out.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000]  I mean, they just closed down,
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000]  or they're on the verge of closing down.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  What's the other one they bought?
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  Oh, diapers.com.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  Same thing.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000]  I think in the long run, I would be surprised
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000]  if Zappos remains an ongoing concern,
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  but I mean, people like it.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  People go there, so maybe they'll keep it around,
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  but the long run for sure is all Amazon.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  Because, and this is the other thing,
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  oh, this is the topic we should talk about.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000]  I haven't written about this yet,
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  but the Amazon Prime video being on Apple TV.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  Oh, yeah, well, I'm making a note.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  We'll talk about that in a minute.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000]  Yeah, well, because I think Amazon is really trying
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  to own every aspect of, you know,
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000]  they want to be the facilitator
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000]  of basically everything in your life,
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  particularly everything in the home,
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000]  and this is what makes the whole Echo line
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000]  so brilliant for Amazon.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  It's, I mean, the opportunity,
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  the reason the opportunity is there
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000]  is because the home is the one place
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  you don't necessarily have your phone with you, right?
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  If you're out and about,
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  you always have your phone with you.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  If you're at home, it's plugged in and charging,
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  and whereas, and the other thing is
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  if you're out and about to just suddenly talk at random,
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  it's getting perhaps more and more socially acceptable,
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  but still a little weird,
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  whereas at home, to kind of shout at an Echo
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  is totally fine, like it's your house.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000]  You can do what you want.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:59.000]  But also it fits with the sort of long-term Amazon model
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:04.000]  of basically being the infrastructure for your home.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.000]  It's how the things in your home get there.
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000]  It's how you resupply.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000]  It's how you do everything,
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000]  and so the focus on clothes and Echo
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000]  and all this sort of stuff fits into that,
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:18.000]  and having another brand that's not Amazon,
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000]  I think, doesn't fit into that in the long run,
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000]  especially with Prime,
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000]  because they want to be, it's all Amazon, it's all Prime,
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.000]  and so we'll see how long Zappos is for this world,
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000]  but I doubt it'll be a focus of their sort of apparel efforts.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  That's a very long way to go.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000]  I think Zappos is doing well.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  Maybe it just continues to run as a sort of independent.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000]  I think you could easily be a, well, maybe not.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  Maybe they make you sign in with Amazon.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000]  I don't know, but I was going to say
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000]  that I think you can shop at Zappos
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  and not even know that they're a subsidiary.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:54.000]  Yeah, but right, and I think that's fine for Amazon,
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:59.000]  as long as it's not someone else, as long as they own it.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000]  Here's the thing that, it doesn't surprise me,
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:06.000]  but I still found it striking
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  was how much of the reaction to the Amazon or the Echo Look,
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000]  the one that's a camera for you getting dressed,
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000]  was a sort of knee-jerk,
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.000]  you think I'm putting a camera connected to the cloud
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  in my dressing room, you gotta be kidding me.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000]  Like a sort of knee-jerk,
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  I am not putting a computerized camera
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  that uploads pictures to the web
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  that you don't trust it or whatever.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000]  And I understand it, and it certainly is,
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  it's a reasonable concern that you'd want it to be private
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  and you'd want it to come from a company that you trust
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  and it's common sense that you'd think,
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:49.000]  at least think twice before you bought it and installed it.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000]  But I think it's almost silly to take the point
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  that you don't think that we're gonna have cameras
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000]  all over our houses soon.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  Like it's, clearly that's where, it's the only way to go.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  Yeah, and the other thing too is,
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:07.000]  I mean, is a camera really much worse than the Echo itself?
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:12.000]  I mean, the entire category is very problematic.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  But that's how people reacted to that a couple years ago.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000]  They did, they did.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000]  It just dies down.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  I'm not saying that we should,
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000]  I think anybody who knows me at all through the show
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  or Daring Fireball would guess that I'm,
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  it's not like I rush headlong into new things
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  without thinking about them.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  In some ways I'm a lowercase C conservative,
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000]  a lot of the, and I don't,
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000]  I find out what I like and then I stick with it.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000]  So I'm not drawn to new and shiny all the time.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000]  But I feel like everybody's a little bit too, in some ways,
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000]  it's good that there's a lot of people
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000]  whose first concern is privacy,
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000]  as opposed to thinking about the cool things
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.000]  you could do with something like this.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  But I'm reminded of, God, it must probably like 99
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000]  or something like that.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000]  But way back around the millennium
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:11.000]  when Mac apps, indie Mac apps first started adding features
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  where they would phone home and just say,
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  you couldn't even upgrade.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  It would like sparkle the technology
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000]  where you can hit a button and have,
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  you're using version 3.1, version 3.2 is out,
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000]  would you like to upgrade?
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  And you just hit a button and it downloads
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  and upgrades and quits and relaunches
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  and there you go, you're running the new one.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000]  But there were apps that would just put a dialogue up
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  and say, hey, there's a new version,
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000]  do you wanna go to the website and download it?
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  And people freaked the fuck out
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  because they were like, what the hell?
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000]  And sniffing the network traffic
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.000]  and it's not like they were revealing anything,
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000]  but the fact that the app was phoning home with anything,
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.000]  even just to check the version was too much for people
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000]  and there were people who would do like,
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  and they meant it, I'm deleting this app,
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000]  I'm switching to a competitor
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  because there's no way that any software of mine
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.000]  is going to phone home to the developer server,
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  even if it's just to check the version.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000]  And I don't wanna make fun of it too bad,
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  but I mean, is there an app that you use today
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  that doesn't notify you when there's a new version?
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  And I feel like we're going that way
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  with microphones and cameras.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  We are, I think there's two sort of points to make.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  One is your broader point,
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000]  and this is the most important point,
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000]  is this is sort of inevitable.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  Like we're going down this direction.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  And the fact of the matter is that
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  most people just don't care.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  And this applies to their online privacy,
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.000]  it applies to, and this is the big problem
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  with sort of fighting for privacy
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  when it comes to technology of products
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  is that unfortunately people don't care.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  And maybe at some point there'll be some scandal
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  that's so bad and so big that it will actually become
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  something that people care about,
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  but to date there's no evidence that that's going to happen.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  And people value convenience, they just do.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:12.000]  And related to that though,
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  it actually is really concerning,
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  like the whole echo thing.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  Like I have echoes all over my house,
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000]  but the actual like, it's not really clear.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  I mean, Amazon says that they're secure
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  and all this sort of stuff,
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  but there's no really recourse for people
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  if they were used badly.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  Like it really is just kind of trusting
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.000]  this massive corporation is going to do the right thing.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  And yeah, obviously people can and will track their network
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  and make sure that it's only sending
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  when Alexa's triggered or whatever it might be.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.000]  But then once it gets on the servers,
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  you don't really know what's happening to it.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  It really is a massive, massive problem.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  Unfortunately, it's a problem that absent
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  some sort of like popular will,
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  it's hard to see anything being done about it.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  Right.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  Once your yo dingus,
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  turn out the lights in the kitchen command goes there,
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  you have no idea where that audio goes
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  and how long it lasts and what they do with it.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  It is a black box.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  So I'm not discounting the privacy concerns,
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  but I think, and it's just like,
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000]  it's such a small example,
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  but just like how apps that can run a version check
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  and notify you of a new version,
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  it is a trade off of privacy where,
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  there is some information of yours
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  that is going to the developer and they can,
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  maybe a lot of times send other things to like
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  what model Macintosh you're on
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  and how much RAM you have or something like that.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  You are trading some privacy by allowing the software
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  to do it, but in return,
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  you're getting something of such convenience.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  It is so much that the days when you used to have
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  to manually follow, there used to be a website,
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  like Mac update where you'd like,
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  part of my morning was go to Mac update
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  and what was the other one?
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  Version tracker, you'd go to version tracker
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  and just see if any of the software I use
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  has a new version out and if so, go and update it.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  I mean, that was actually part of my like daily routine.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  It seems like madness at this point.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  And there's so much of the convenience
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  of these AI assistants
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  and we're just, just touching our toes in it.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  Like, I don't know.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  The more I think about it,
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  and I know I've been talking about it
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  a lot more on the show,
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  like if I were to go to a company like Apple
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  or Microsoft or something or Google,
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  like what would I want to be working on?
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.000]  I mean, until now, almost unquestionably,
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000]  what I would want to be working on
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  is visual user interface stuff for the GUI.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  I think if I were there now,
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.000]  I think the AI stuff would be what I would want to work on
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  because I feel like there's so much potential there.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  One thing that's interesting about the Echo
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  and with the Echo Show is I think in some respects,
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  it was good for Amazon to launch with just the speaker
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  because it was like the original Mac
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  launching without arrow keys.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000]  So you had to use the mouse
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  and the foundation of it being a voice interface
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  is baked in very, very deeply.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  And so now the show comes out
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  and it has a screen, but it's not a touchscreen.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  It's still all voice controlled,
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  but it's weird because if it came out originally,
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  we'd say, wow, there's a screen.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  It's not a touchscreen.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  This is so weird,
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  and people wouldn't really get how to interact with it.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  Now it's like, oh, wow, it's so much so convenient.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  It's an Echo with a screen.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  The whole framing and the way you think about the product
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  is actually totally different
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  because it was a more sort of limited product
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  to start out with.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  I did not realize it was not a touchscreen.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  I find that shocking.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  It's not a touchscreen?
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  No.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  Wow, that's shocking to me.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  I find that crazy.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  I think that's a huge mistake.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  I think there's all sorts of things
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.000]  that you'd want to do
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  that you'd want to be able to touch
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  to confirm or something like that.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000]  Wait, yeah, no, I'm totally wrong.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.000]  It is a touchscreen.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000]  Oh, geez.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  I thought maybe someone at Amazon
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000]  had a stroke or something.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000]  Yeah, no, that's funny.
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000]  I don't know.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  I knew it was a touchscreen
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  and it suddenly got stuck in my head
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000]  that it was not a touchscreen.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.000]  The point I was meaning to make...
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  Tell Cable to do it.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  No way, man.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  We're leaving it in.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  The point I was trying to make, though,
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  is the primary means of interacting with it
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000]  is voice.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  Had it been a touchscreen to start out with,
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  that's what I'm trying to say.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000]  It would have been much more limited than it is
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000]  because developers, all the skills,
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  would have all been biased towards touch.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000]  Now they're all biased towards voice
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  and you can add on touch.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000]  That was weird.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000]  I just completely hallucinated
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.000]  for like five minutes there.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000]  I just wrote about it yesterday.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000]  I wrote about it being a touchscreen.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.000]  I do see your point, though.
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.000]  I see your point, though,
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000]  that it is voice first and it matters what's first,
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000]  that the Mac being mouse first
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000]  influenced the design of the GUI in a way
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000]  that if you could have treated it as keyboard first,
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000]  that's how the software would have been written
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000]  because that's how all the other software
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000]  on all the other platforms was written.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000]  Right, exactly, exactly.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000]  That was so weird.
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000]  You could use an original Macintosh,
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000]  like if you had two of the original Macintosh side by side
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000]  and one of them only had the mouse hooked up
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000]  and the other one only had the keyboard hooked up,
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000]  you could get more done on the one
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000]  that had the mouse hooked up
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000]  and there might have been things
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000]  that you couldn't even do on the keyboard.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.000]  Yeah, you couldn't even get to the menu bar.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000]  The only thing you could do in the menu bar
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.000]  was have the keyboard shortcuts memorized.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000]  Right, and in the long run, they brought them back
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000]  and it's better to have all the arrow keys there
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000]  and whatnot, but yeah,
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000]  as far as getting the paradigm watch,
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:55.000]  and had it been a touchscreen to start,
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.000]  that's just kind of like, it was just a phone,
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000]  but it works because it's locked in one spot
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:06.000]  and to really drive home that it is a voice interface,
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000]  yeah, I think they're better off starting there.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.000]  But that said, the other thing, though,
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:16.000]  with the screen is I think this calling thing,
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000]  we mentioned, we talked before with the phone
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000]  and stuff like that, but I think there really is value
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:24.000]  to being able to just initiate a conversation
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000]  and probably the most interesting thing here,
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000]  and here Amazon totally sort of ripped off
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000]  one of their companies.
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.000]  They have a venture fund for companies
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000]  that they have Alexa built in
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000]  and there's a company that built
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:40.000]  a voice communication device that has Echo built in
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000]  and it's basically, Amazon just completely Sherlock them,
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000]  which is bad enough when it's software
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000]  and it's probably far more painful when it's hardware.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000]  But once you have trusted people, you can drop in,
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000]  which basically means you can initiate a call
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000]  without their having to go the right,
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000]  like actually answer it or do whatever.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000]  You could just be like sort of instant sort of thing.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000]  Now, that sounds terrible in a lot of situations,
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:06.000]  but for me, I'm in a separate office from down the street
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:09.000]  from the house to be able to just like be able
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000]  to literally drop in.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000]  It's someone, if I was working from home,
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000]  to have someone be able to come in the top of the door
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000]  and stick their head in.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000]  It's the same sort of idea.
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000]  Obviously, you're not going to use it all the time,
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.000]  but the possibility I think is compelling and interesting
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000]  and fundamentally different from FaceTime,
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000]  fundamentally different from having
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000]  to get your phone and pull it out.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.000]  For the kids to call grandma, like something like this
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:36.000]  is really, is more convenient than having to use FaceTime.
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:42.000]  I forget what it was in the context of one of these things
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.000]  where it was like, just how crude all of these things,
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000]  whatever your favorite is, the Alexa platform
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000]  or Siri or Google or whatever.
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.000]  It's so early days on all of them that we will look back
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.000]  and this is like to the personal computer,
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000]  like what the Apple II was in 1981.
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.000]  We're just at the tip of the iceberg,
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000]  that you can see where we're going.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:11.000]  And I wrote that really what I want is I want like a C3PO.
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000]  But I thought about it a couple days later,
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000]  I realized I was totally wrong.
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:18.000]  That's too much because having the actual robot
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000]  who can walk around is an entirely different set
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000]  of problems.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.000]  For these AI assistants, what I want is HAL from 2001.
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000]  I wrote that and I feel like every time you bring up HAL,
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000]  everybody just goes immediately to,
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  yeah, but he killed a bunch of astronauts
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.000]  and tried to kill the last one too
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000]  and it had to be put down.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  All right, put aside the fact that he killed people.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.000]  But he did kill people for a very logical reason.
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  I don't want to spoil the movie, but it's, you know.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.000]  But if you haven't watched 2001,
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  you should go watch 2001.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.000]  But if you just, if you think about the stuff
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  that HAL does in the movie and how the astronauts
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  interact with them, it's exactly where we're going.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  It is exactly the, there could not be a better,
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  everybody is racing towards HAL,
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  where it's not just a voice and a speaker
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  where you can ask HAL, you know,
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  what's the square root of 256 or something like that
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  and get an answer.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  It's that, it's the home automation integration
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  where you can say things like tell your dingus
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  to, you know, close all the blinds
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  if you have blinds that are hooked up to the smart house
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  or something like that or change the color of your lights
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  or something like that.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  Like that's how they ran the spaceship
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  is they would tell HAL to, you know,
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  open the pod bay doors or something like that.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:42.000]  Like that's exactly where we're going with all these things.
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  And it's, you know, and you watch and one of the things
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  that, you know, Kubrick got so well in that movie
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  is that they're, you know, from the perspective
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  of somebody watching it in 1968,
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  it was like whiz-bang futuristic stuff like wow,
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000]  you can tell HAL to open the door and the door opens.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  But the astronauts acted like it was the most normal thing
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  in the world because they were used to it.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  Right.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.000]  Anyway, I think everybody needs to watch HAL
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  and realize that that's exactly where we're going.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  And the other thing too about HAL was that,
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  and it would have been so easy from 1968's perspective
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  to imagine HAL as a big refrigerator computing device
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:26.000]  that's located in like the bridge of the spaceship.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  And to think of, you know, because that's what computers were.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000]  But HAL was everywhere, right?
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  They were just little red cameras all around the ship.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.000]  He was a system that was running throughout the whole ship.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  Right.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  And that's exactly the model of like, I mean,
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  the Amazon to a T where you sprinkle these dots
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  throughout your house so that, you know,
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  if you're upstairs or downstairs, you can access the exact same system.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  The other, I completely agree.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  I think it is a great example of the, what everyone is going for.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  The other point I would make, I was just thinking about this
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  in terms of FaceTime is Google launched a FaceTime competitor.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  I can't remember what it's called.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  Was it Alo?
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  No, Alo's the chat app.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  Weirdly, they launched two apps separately.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  Google Duo.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  Yeah, I mean, the problem with that is it's a separate app.
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000]  You have to go download it, et cetera.
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  And it's work beyond, you know, like FaceTime is built in.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.000]  Now, obviously, the advantage is you can theoretically go across the platform.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  Then you're competing against Skype, though, which has similar capability.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  And it's just a hard, Google's problem is always sort of the go-to-market.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  How do they actually get their products and technology into people's hands?
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  And, you know, obviously Android is one way to do that,
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  but then you have to get people on iPhones to download it.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  Anyhow, it's hard.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  My impression of Google from the outside, and the Alo Duo thing is a perfect example of it,
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:14.000]  is that their company culture is so resistant to, like, product people that, you know,
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  like, in and of itself, there's nothing un-product-like about Alo or Duo,
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.000]  but there's clearly no overarching strategy connecting the two,
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  or otherwise they wouldn't exist as separate products.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  But there's nobody.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  I don't feel there's anybody in a position of authority to sort of crack that whip and guide it.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  It's, you know, it's just a thousand individual cats wandering around Mountain View
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  doing whatever the hell they want.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  It certainly does not seem ideal.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  But the difference here with Alexa and this voice calling is because of this show device,
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  like, there is actually a reason to download the app and to use it,
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  because there is capability that is, like, it's not just a rip-off.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  It's actually doing something new and unique that is worth going to the trouble of downloading the app for.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  And so it's actually, I would argue, much more of a threat in the long run to FaceTime
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  than Google or Skype or whatever, even though those have the advantage of being cross-platform.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  Alo is not only cross-platform, but also has this third dimension that makes you want to use it.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:34.000]  Yeah, I can sort of see that.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  I wonder how many people use Alo. I never really hear about it anymore.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  It seems like one of those things that, you know, like, is anybody using it?
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  Well, I mean, this is a, it's created for Google's benefit because they felt like they needed a chat app.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  Yeah, like, there's no market need for it.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  Like, there are plenty of chat apps.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  And this is the, and you can't, like, they added some features.
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  Like, you can't just tack on some features.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  Like, you have to create a fun, like, the Echo Show creates a fundamentally new use case for video calling.
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  Because it's like this omnipresent object in a specific location, like, in a place where it actually makes sense.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  Yes, it's kind of a landline, blah, blah, blah.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  But, you know, you can't, when you're wandering around your house and you have your phone with you,
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  to be able to just shout out, call whoever.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  And you can call other Echos.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  It's not just a show.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  So you can call from Echo to phone.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  It's a fundamentally new use case, whereas these Google products had some new features,
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  but the actual use case was well served by plenty of other apps that were there early.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  And it's even more difficult because it's a network product, and the single most important feature,
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:49.000]  the single most important feature of any chat app is, do your friends and family use it?
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  Like, nothing else matters beyond that.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  Yep.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  Because it's like the old argument about, you know, who bought the first fax machine?
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  Right.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  Who the hell are you getting faxes from? You just bought the first one.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  But all of a sudden, if one guy across town buys the second one, all of a sudden, you've got something that's valuable.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:14.000]  I mean, it has more value than it did when yours was the only fax machine on the phone network.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  And this is why, one thing that was really interesting was when the whole messaging app, like, revolution went on.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  It was very brief. It was like two or three years.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  And what happened was, it was really one sort of country by country.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  And countries would basically settle on one service, and that was it. And it was over.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  Like, the fight was done. There was no more of a fight to be had.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:44.000]  And you had companies like WeChat and Line spending all kinds of money trying to break into other countries.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  But once you're already established, absent some massive leap in functionality,
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  the reason why messaging was such a big deal is that in nearly every country in the world, except for the U.S., you have to pay for SMS.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  And I think this is why the U.S. thing is more fragmented and is much further, much more behind as opposed to messaging app penetration.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  I mean, and why iMessage is probably the strongest network because it's piggyback on SMS.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  But it was different in almost every other country in the world, where not having to pay is a really powerful way to drive adoption, right?
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  But once that was done, once everyone is already using a chat app that lets them chat for free,
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:38.000]  to get them to switch and not just switch one person, because you have to switch everyone simultaneously at the same time,
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.000]  is basically extremely difficult.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  Right. The lack of foresight that the carriers had by trying to milk the SMS revenue at the expense of, well, if we just give everybody free,
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  at the very least, they're attached to the phone, right, then their phone number.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  And we've at least got a sticky platform.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  Like in the way that iMessage has been very, very good to Apple, even though they've never once charged to send.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  Oh, it's one of Apple's, yep.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  Yeah, I mean, it's one of Apple's, I've probably complained about this on the talk show before.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  For sure I've complained about it on exponents.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  But people often ask, or I get emails whenever I write about messaging apps.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  And people are like, you know, oh, Apple, why isn't iMessage in the stock price?
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  You know, 10 cent is worth X amount. Facebook's worth X amount.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  Apple's stock should be higher because they have iMessage.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  And like, no, iMessage is absolutely accounted for. It's accounted for in the phone.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  Like it is a reason why Apple can maintain charge such high margins on the phone, can maintain its share, can be so dominant.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:58.000]  And iMessage is not the reason, but it is a significant reason why people on iPhones continue to buy iPhones.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:04.000]  And so it's super valuable and it is accounted for. It's just embedded in the iPhone.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  Yeah, I do think it might be discounted in some ways, but it's different than the independent messaging platforms.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  Yeah, but if you broke it out, if iMessage was actually available on Android and, well, I guess that's the only one that matters.
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  Yes, maybe the iMessage category or whatever division would be worth a lot.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  But the iPhone, I think the cost that would be borne by the iPhone would actually be even greater than that.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  Right. That's why when there was that rumor last year that Apple was going to ship iMessage for Android.
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  I do believe, in fact, I heard from people that there absolutely positively were mocks that were floated within Apple,
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.000]  but that doesn't mean that there was ever any serious intention to do it.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:58.000]  It's almost more like, well, why wouldn't there be? Why wouldn't they at least sketch out how it would work,
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000]  whether they have any intention of doing it or not?
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:06.000]  But it just seemed to me so unlikely because it seemed to me like whatever they would get from it,
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:14.000]  they would lose in the stickiness that iMessage gives to the phone in terms of any kind of temptation you have.
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.000]  If you have tons and tons of blue bubbles in your text with your friends and family,
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:26.000]  any temptation you might have to switch to an Android phone when it dawns on you that you lose all those iMessages and everything goes green.
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000]  It's like, maybe not.
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:36.000]  Right. That's a motivation for making iMessages more and more, have more and more features and things like that.
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:44.000]  I think they've done a pretty poor job of it, but the motivation is to differentiate it from SMS even further
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:49.000]  so that to switch something else feels like a terrible idea.
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:59.000]  I'm not a big fan of, I don't like using Android in part, I'm not used to it, but there's little things that I don't like
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  that kind of run off the wall. But without question, I have a Pixel now.
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:14.000]  I use Android phones occasionally, but iMessage is without question the most straight-up,
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:19.000]  frustrating aspect of using an Android phone for any period of time.
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  There's little stuff for whatever reason, you can get used to it and get over it.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:26.000]  You can't really get past there not being iMessage.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  But it's interesting to think of iMessage as a wholly-owned proprietary to iOS and Mac OS, to a lesser degree, messaging platform that Apple owns.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  And think about this, tell me if you think this is an interesting hypothetical, but what if when Instagram was on the market,
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  what if Apple had bought Instagram instead of Facebook and kept it iOS only?
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:46:03.000]  Is that interesting to think of? I think it kind of is, like in a way that people use, that the blue bubbles are seen as having more status than green bubbles.
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:13.000]  Imagine if there were tens of millions of people sharing photos on Instagram and you couldn't even look at it unless you had an iPhone.
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  It is really interesting. It's value-destructive to buy a horizontal service and limit it to a platform in the context of the service itself.
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:38.000]  So Instagram is worth a huge amount of money, vastly more than Facebook paid for it.
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:46.000]  They paid $1 billion, but I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to sell it now. I would think $50 billion, I don't know.
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:56.000]  It's worth so much that it's almost whatever somebody would be willing to pay for it. It's kind of hard to put the value on it.
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  And they'd be willing to pay a lot. So it would not be worth that by itself.
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:10.000]  But to your point, by the time Android came out, which was like three days before Facebook bought it,
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:21.000]  the momentum and place that Instagram had in popular culture, even with only having however many users it had, it was a thing.
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  It was very much a thing just being on iOS. And yeah, would it still be a thing? I think that's sort of the longer-run question.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  Would it be able to maintain that, or would a cross-platform service really...
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:46.000]  I mean, Snapchat would probably be in much better shape today if Apple had done that, being something that's more broadly accessible.
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  It's a really interesting point.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  Well, clearly, if Apple had bought Instagram, Facebook would have done their best.
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  If we see what they do with Snapchat, they would have tried seven different ways to copy Instagram,
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  whether it was with their own new app or whether putting it in your regular Facebook feed, just like they've copied Snapchat's stories gimmick seven different ways.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  So maybe it would have been Facebook somehow would have done it. But I still think there's something interesting there.
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  And the idea would be that it wouldn't necessarily, like Instagram itself as an Apple subsidiary,
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  wouldn't be worth anywhere near what Instagram is worth today as a Facebook subsidiary with so many more users.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  Right, but would the iPhone be worth that much more?
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  Right, the iPhone might be worth more because people would be terrified of getting a different phone
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  because they wouldn't be able to share their stuff to Instagram anymore, and they've got 4,000 followers or whatever on Instagram.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.000]  And the only way they can keep that going is if they keep buying iPhones.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  And I can't help but think that that was... I have never heard this from anybody, so this is just complete speculation on my part.
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:57.000]  No, not a single birdie has ever said anything to me, but I thought it was so conspicuous.
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  I thought it right at the time that Instagram for Android shipped coincident with their acquisition from Facebook.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:10.000]  It was only after the Facebook acquisition was made official. I forget if all the eyes were dotted.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  Yeah, it was like the same week.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  I cannot help but think that Apple might have at least been at the table.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  And the fact that it would be a lot easier to never have had an Android version than to sell to Apple and cancel the Android version.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  And I think the only part of it that was even interesting to Apple was that it was iOS exclusive.
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  And famously...
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  Without question, yeah. Instagram as it is today is not available to Apple.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  Right, that's the funny thing.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  That's the funny thing is that Instagram is more valuable today, but it wouldn't be more valuable to Apple.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  It was only valuable to Apple as an iOS exclusive.
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  And it emphasized their product marketing that the camera is better on the iPhone, that it kind of fit in.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  Yeah, you know, Schiller deleted his Instagram account right after the Android version came out.
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:10.000]  The more you mentioned it, yeah, I think they probably should have done it.
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  Again, Instagram would not be worth what it is today as a part of Apple.
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  And it's very possible, to your point, another network will come along and supplant it.
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  But would it be worth more than $1 billion of value to the iPhone franchise?
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  Without question. You don't have to sell that many marginal iPhones to make up a billion dollars.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  And yeah, it's a really interesting point.
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  And even now today, I forget what year that was when that happened.
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  But even now today, it plays even more into the camera emphasis of Apple's iPhone product marketing.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  Yeah, absolutely. Yep, I agree. I agree is a miss.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  I mean, the real shame is that Instagram sold it all. I mean, I feel like things would be so much healthier if,
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  I mean, Instagram is really the purchase that cemented Facebook's dominance.
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  Because it's Instagram that is different enough from Facebook in a way that it really,
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:20.000]  the market niche that it's filling was really a big hole for Facebook.
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  And it'd be nice if it was an independent company.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  It's a terrific compliment to Facebook. And it's a better Twitter than Twitter in some ways.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:37.000]  Or at least it's a Twitter that knows, and I love Twitter. I do love Twitter.
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:41.000]  And Instagram is, of course, completely pointless and useless for something like news.
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  Like as we speak today, 24 hours ago, we just found out that Trump fired the head of the FBI.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:54.000]  I'm sure, I don't know what you did if you were up, maybe you were sleeping at the time.
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  But as soon as you found out about it, I bet you went to Twitter, right?
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.000]  Right.
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:03.000]  I mean, politics over the side. When I found out that Trump fired the head of the FBI,
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  investigating his own campaign's ties to Russia, I went to Twitter to see,
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:14.000]  what were the news articles that were coming out? What were people whose opinion I value on such subjects?
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:18.000]  Instagram has nothing to do with something like that. You don't go to Instagram for breaking news.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.000]  But the problem that Twitter has...
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000]  But that's part of Instagram's value.
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.000]  Right.
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:26.000]  And that's part why people...
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:31.000]  But it's Twitter-like in that it's the same basic model that Twitter pioneered,
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  which is you... it's very simple. It's brilliant. It seems so obvious, but nobody did it before Twitter,
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:45.000]  which is you have a feed of the things you post, and you pick people whose feeds you want to see.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  And then when you look at the app, you see all of the posts from the people who you've chosen to follow
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:59.000]  in one stream, and you scroll down, and then when you get bored, you hit one that you've already seen before you stop.
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  It's like they took that basic model and made something that was very self-assured
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:07.000]  and knew exactly what it was for and what people would do with it.
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  People don't look at Instagram and say, I don't know what to do with this.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:15.000]  Like a lot of normal people do when they see Twitter. They're like, I don't know what I'm looking at.
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:19.000]  Right. And photos are such a...
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  And this is something that Facebook knew when they bought Instagram.
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000]  Facebook was built on photos, photo sharing.
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:30.000]  But to break that down just through a stream of individual photos.
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:34.000]  And not only that is it super understandable, super approachable, and something people like,
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  but it lends itself very obviously and easily to advertising.
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:43.000]  And in a way that advertising on Twitter is hard.
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:49.000]  Yes, you can have the promoted tweet thing, but you're scrolling past it so quickly,
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000]  and it's hard to really sort of get immersed in it.
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:56.000]  It's hard to add more media in part because it makes a better canvas for advertising.
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.000]  But just the way you use Twitter is not really amenable to it.
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:02.000]  And Twitter has had zero luck getting any sort of direct response
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  where you see something and you take an action.
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:08.000]  That's just not how people think and operate when they're on Twitter.
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  Whereas Instagram, there is success.
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:14.000]  People like to put products, like people of all brands on Instagram
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000]  because they like looking at products.
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  And sometimes they look at a product and they want to buy the product.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000]  And are they making that possible?
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:25.000]  No, I've seen product, just watch stuff.
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  I follow a lot of watch accounts on Instagram.
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:32.000]  And for obvious reasons, the watch stuff is way, to me at least,
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  it's way more interesting on Instagram than it is on Twitter because it's all visual.
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  It's like, hey, take a look at this picture of a watch.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:42.000]  If you're interested in watches, that's interesting,
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:46.000]  whereas here's some text about a watch is not really interesting.
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  There's product shots that have thousands and thousands of likes.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  It's thousands.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:02.000]  For an advertiser to get likes on their ad, that's a huge deal.
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  In the rest of the web, they're trying to get people from blocking all their ads,
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  whereas on Instagram, they're looking for them.
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:16.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  Some people do complain about getting the ads in front of people.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  People do complain on Instagram to a degree.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  But same thing with the Facebook feed.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  What's so brilliant about these mobile advertisements
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  and why it turned out.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  Well, it turned out actually, no, mobile was way more valuable.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000]  You just had to figure out the format.
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  And what's so brilliant about the format of both Instagram and Facebook
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:53.000]  is you simultaneously have much more of a grip on a user's attention.
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  An ad on Facebook or Instagram literally takes over the entire screen of your device.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:04.000]  But because it's embedded in this feed that you're going through,
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  it doesn't feel nearly as obtrusive as, I'm looking at this article,
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  I'm looking at a web page on the browser right now, on the Mac,
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  and there's this big banner ad on the side.
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  It's so annoying.
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:20.000]  Despite the fact, if you actually think about it, it's not actually obstructing me at all.
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:28.000]  But it's just weird how the feed is such a perfect advertising vehicle.
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  As you know, as the inventor.
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  It just makes intuitive sense to me that it always had.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  It always did from the moment the iPhone came out that, of course,
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  it eventually is going to be a terrific place to do advertising in some way.
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  The hard part is only figuring out the right way.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  But to discount it as less valuable, you have to be a moron
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  because it's obviously the device.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  You only have to spend two minutes in 2007 looking at an original iPhone owner's relationship with their phone
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  and see that it's by far and away the most emotionally attached computing device that they own.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  It's intimate.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  And of course that's valuable.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.000]  It's super valuable.
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  And it's with them all the time.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  How could that not be more valuable?
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  Again, I'm not saying it was obvious at all that something like Instagram,
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  I mean, I'd be a very wealthy man if I had come up with the idea for Instagram in 2007.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  But I just knew, though, that there was some kind of opportunity there, right?
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.000]  Right.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.000]  Crazy.
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  To discount it.
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:41.000]  Just because you couldn't show the same type of ads that you could show on a desktop.
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  Right.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  Let me take a break.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  Let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor.
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:46.000]  Unless you had a good point to make.
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  Do you have a good point?
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.000]  No.
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:49.000]  I have no good points.
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:50.000]  You have one point.
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000]  All right.
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:58.000]  Our third and final sponsor of the episode is our good friend at Squarespace.
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000]  Look, next time you have to do something new.
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000]  You've got a new company you're starting.
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000]  You want to start a podcast, your own podcast.
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:08.000]  You want to start a blog.
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.000]  It's May.
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:10.000]  Maybe you're a student.
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  You're graduating.
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:14.000]  You want to put together a portfolio site of your work.
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:15.000]  Do it in Squarespace.
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000]  Make your next move on Squarespace.
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000]  If you want to make a website, do it on Squarespace.
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:20.000]  I'm telling you.
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:21.000]  Do it first.
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:28.000]  If you spend half an hour trying it in Squarespace, you'll be halfway to having your thing done,
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:34.000]  whereas if you did it by hand, you'd still be learning PHP or something like that.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:35.000]  I'm telling you.
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  You can make your own website with Squarespace with no coding experience, no programming experience,
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000]  no system administrator experience.
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000]  All of that stuff is all taken care of.
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:45.000]  It's an all-in-one platform.
[01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:51.000]  This is the thing I think people don't get about Squarespace is that everything from
[01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:55.000]  registering your domain name to keeping the server running to collecting the stats that
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:59:00.000]  show you which pages on site people are going to and stuff like that, it's all there.
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:01.000]  It's all in the platform.
[01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:04.000]  So you don't have to do, well, you do this and then you have it.
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:05.000]  It's just hosted.
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:08.000]  But then if you want to get stats, you've got to install some other analytics package
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:09.000]  or something like that.
[01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:10.000]  None of it.
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:13.000]  All of it is right there in Squarespace platform.
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:17.000]  The thing I always keep emphasizing is they have all these templates to choose from, but
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:22.000]  they have so many templates and the templates are so easily configured with your own graphics
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:27.000]  or fonts or something like that that your site doesn't look like a cookie cutter Squarespace site.
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:31.000]  I guarantee you, you visit Squarespace sites every day and don't even realize they're
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:36.000]  Squarespace sites because they look original to the brands of the company of site it is.
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:44.000]  So next time you need a new website, go to squarespace.com and slash talk show and use
[01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:49.000]  the code groober, my last name, when you actually fork over the dough and you'll save 10% off
[01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:50.000]  your first order.
[01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:53.000]  My thanks to Squarespace, long time sponsor of the show.
[01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000]  Good friends.
[01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000]  All right.
[01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000]  We got to get to China, right?
[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000]  That's the whole reason you're on the show.
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:06.000]  Yeah, this is my busy season.
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000]  By busy season, I mean it's the NBA playoffs.
[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:16.000]  So I haven't had a chance to listen to your episode last week where I think you discussed this.
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.000]  A little bit.
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:23.000]  But what I wrote about was more, you know, if you read my article, then you know where I stand.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000]  Got it.
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:26.000]  I don't know.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000]  I hope I represented you fairly.
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000]  Do you feel like I represented you fairly?
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:32.000]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:37.000]  I think the part where you disagree with me, you're wrong, which is fine because we can talk about it.
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:44.000]  We should because I would say that more, like, I got more, hey, I usually agree with you,
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000]  but I think you're wrong on this.
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  I got more of that for that stance than anything in recent memory, which doesn't make me dig
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:53.000]  in my heels.
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:56.000]  It makes me think, hmm, there's a good chance I'm wrong about this.
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:01.000]  Yeah, and this is one of the great things about writing for the web generally that, like,
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:06.000]  you've made this comment before and I've stolen it because I think it's such a great way to put it.
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:14.000]  The goal, I love being right, but the way you're right is by fixing the parts when you're wrong.
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:21.000]  And having tons of people giving you feedback is a great way to get right much more quickly than was ever possible before.
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:22.000]  Right.
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:23.000]  I like to be right all the time.
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:28.000]  And the way to be right all the time is to catch the times that you're wrong and correct them.
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:29.000]  Right.
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  Like I said, I totally stole that from you, but I think it's a great way to think about it.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:33.000]  Right.
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  And too many people who want to be right all the time, and let's say they're right most of the time,
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000]  they're defensive about the times that they're wrong.
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:46.000]  And when they are wrong, you see it all the time.
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000]  You see it in politics, you see it in tech, you see it in anything you follow.
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:55.000]  But when they're wrong, you can see it, that they're digging in and trying to spin away to make it that they're right.
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:01.000]  Whereas the easiest thing in the world to do is to just publish an update and say, you know what, totally wrong.
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:04.000]  Yeah, and I write these every now and then.
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:10.000]  I actually like it in some respects when something comes along that I was wrong about.
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:13.000]  And sometimes I'm factually wrong, and that's an easy correction.
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  I just mis-screw something up or whatever, like saying that there was no touchscreen.
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.000]  Sometimes my predictions are wrong or my analysis is wrong.
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:24.000]  And in some respects, I actually value that.
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:31.000]  Because as soon as that happens, I will write a big post that I will say what I got wrong, I'll say why I got wrong,
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:36.000]  I'll explain my thought process that went into it, what part of my thought process in retrospect was incorrect.
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:46.000]  And then the value that accrues is not just that now I'm right, but also it kind of gives you capital to say other stuff in the future.
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:52.000]  Because people will take you more seriously, because even if what you're saying is wrong,
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  they will know that one, you will correct yourself in the future,
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:05.000]  but two, there's a process that goes into it that it's not just sort of like shooting from the hip sort of thing.
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:10.000]  So for me, I actually think it's not just a benefit of the web, I don't need an editor,
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:14.000]  although that is from a very sort of small perspective the case.
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:20.000]  I think from a big perspective, it's one of the wonderful things about writing for a large audience.
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:28.000]  Yeah, and it's sort of like being happy every once in a while when you have to correct a pretty big error,
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:36.000]  or just like, oh, I was convinced that all doors should open from the left, but dude, that's idiotic.
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  Sometimes the doors should open from the right.
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:41.000]  You publish it, you just say it like that.
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:44.000]  It's sort of proof that the system works.
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:52.000]  I like to think that when I'm wrong, I will recognize it instantly and swallow my pride
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:58.000]  and do what I can to fix it as unambiguously as possible.
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  But if I don't do it for a while, how do I know that I'm not, even though I think that that's what I'm willing to do,
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:07.000]  how do I know that I'm not just going into denial every time I'm wrong?
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  Yeah, no, exactly, and this is something that I think about a ton, like this idea of confirmation bias,
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  where you always look for evidence that supports your position,
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:26.000]  and it takes a lot of discipline to actively look for reasons why you might be wrong, which I absolutely try to do.
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:32.000]  But then also just having, like I said, the fact you get instant feedback and people pushing back on you
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:35.000]  forces you to think about that.
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:42.000]  So anyhow, it's just a sort of meta commentary.
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000]  Oh, sorry, go ahead.
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:50.000]  Well, I think a good example of that, I think probably the product review that I probably did the worst job on
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:55.000]  was the original Apple Watch, and that's why a month later I wrote a second one where it was more or less
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:05:01.000]  the same basic idea of, here's this new product from Apple, what is it and what do I think about it?
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:06.000]  The first one was just, I don't know, it wasn't awful, but it wasn't poorly written,
[02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:12.000]  but it just never sat right with me, and rereading it a month later, I was like, I don't know,
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000]  it felt like a swing and a miss.
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:21.000]  And I feel like part of the problem was that it was too much of a what's good about this product review,
[02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:26.000]  whereas it should have, it was written from that perspective.
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:32.000]  I don't know if that's quite confirmation bias, but Apple wouldn't do this if they didn't have a good reason to do it,
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000]  so what are those good reasons?
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:39.000]  Whereas I think the story was more, this is a, especially that 1.0 watch,
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:42.000]  this is a product that doesn't really know what it's good for yet.
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:47.000]  Yeah, no, I mean, it's funny, I was all over the place on the watch.
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:51.000]  My original take was that, which is like, this is a product that is lacking vision.
[02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000]  It doesn't know what it is.
[02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000]  Well, I think that's more accurate.
[02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:01.000]  Right, exactly. Well, then I went back and I actually fell into the, like, I had too much faith in Apple,
[02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:04.000]  like, are they really just launching this beautiful device?
[02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000]  And that's really the point.
[02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:11.000]  And so I actually went back and changed my mind and had this very notorious, contentious episode of X1
[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000]  where me and James were arguing about it.
[02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:20.000]  And then eventually I came back, in this case, my fix was actually wrong and worse,
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:26.000]  so I had to go back and, like, no, actually, I had it right the first time, and so I hate that.
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:30.000]  I hate that that happened, especially because I actually had it right the first time.
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000]  But yeah, I mean, whatever, it happens.
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:39.000]  If you're giving your analysis or opinion four days a week, you're going to get it wrong,
[02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000]  which is fine as long as you correct it.
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:47.000]  So you run into this, we've spoken about this, that you don't write,
[02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:52.000]  Stratechery is not, it's the tech in general, I mean, and if you tend to write 
[02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:53.000]  Stratechery, yes.
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000]  Stratechery. Stratechery. Stratechery.
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:58.000]  Stratechery. Stratechery. Tech, tech, tech. It's about tech.
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.000]  I honestly 
[02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:00.000]  Terrible name.
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000]  I honestly don't even do it to razz you. I honestly have done it.
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:03.000]  I know.
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000]  I made the mispronounce, the mispronounce 
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:08.000]  No, I pronounced it differently at the beginning, so I made it even worse.
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:12.000]  It was already a bad name and I made it worse, so it's all 100% my fault.
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:15.000]  But alas, it is what it is, so.
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:21.000]  I just tell people  people ask about my site, I just tell them to search for Ben Thompson on Google.
[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:26.000]  That's the old Jason Fried thing. We were talking about domain names.
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:29.000]  For years and years, Basecamp, they didn't have basecamp.com.
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:35.000]  They have it now, but they just had basecamphq.com because somebody had basecamp.com
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000]  and he didn't feel like paying their exorbitant price.
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:41.000]  He did eventually, but he was like, screw it, people just Google for Basecamp anyway.
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000]  Right.
[02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:48.000]  Which is true. Anyway, you've written about this.
[02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:55.000]  So you don't  it's certainly not  your writing is not Apple-focused, not even the way that mine is.
[02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:59.000]  But you certainly do write enough about Apple simply because if you write about tech in general,
[02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:04.000]  Apple is kind of a big company and they kind of do  a lot of  tend to do interesting things.
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:10.000]  But you've spoken about this, that when you write articles or have like a column that's sort of critical of Apple,
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:13.000]  you get like unsubscriptions sometimes.
[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:16.000]  It's like people don't want to hear it.
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000]  No, that's always been the case.
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:22.000]  I mean, it was  so when I started, I wrote a lot more, probably even more about Apple,
[02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000]  in part because that was a company I knew the best.
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:29.000]  I had been following them closely. I had written a huge paper about them in school.
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:34.000]  I spent a lot of time trying to understand and think about what made them successful.
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:42.000]  I was an intern there at Apple University and came to learn and understand so much about sort of the inner workings.
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000]  It was a fantastic experience.
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:53.000]  And especially when I started also, it was when the whole Samsung is disrupting Apple narrative was in place.
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:59.000]  And so I got tons of articles saying this is dumb, like trying to explain Apple and their differentiation.
[02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  And then it was controversial to say that iOS was not going to be swamped by Android
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:07.000]  and developers weren't going to flee en masse and all this sort of stuff.
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000]  That was still a thing back then.
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:12.000]  The iPhone dead in the water, Henry Blodgett.
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000]  Right, right.
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:21.000]  And the biggest, as I've recounted, the biggest event in the early trajectory days for getting readership
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:27.000]  was you linking to me and saying this is a fantastic new blog and you link to a bunch of articles.
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:33.000]  And as per kind of like this column this week, you're like, oh, this is a great blog, really good, blah, blah, blah.
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000]  But for the first time, I disagree with Mr. Thompson.
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:38.000]  Then he explained where I was wrong.
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:41.000]  That was an outright disagreement, though.
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:42.000]  Not this time.
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:47.000]  This time, like I said, it's a subtle difference of weight, I would say.
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:50.000]  Yeah, and I actually think you were right in that case.
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:53.000]  Oh, I was definitely right back then.
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:58.000]  Really, I was just waiting for you to make a mistake, and then I knew I could link to you
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:03.000]  because then instead of just saying how great it was, I could also point out that you made an error in your thinking.
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000]  I was just waiting for it.
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:11.000]  The longest story, though, is sort of my initial, and then after that I got linked to by Marco a couple times.
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:17.000]  So I really started in the sort of Apple blogosphere is where awareness of me started to grow.
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:23.000]  So a lot of my initial followers were in that arena.
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:28.000]  So you fast-forward like a year or something, and I wrote something about Apple and services.
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:34.000]  And basically, I think it was a good point, it's a point that I brought up again and again,
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:42.000]  is how companies are sort of shaped by their origin, and that influences the culture
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000]  and the way they approach products for the entire life of a company.
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:48.000]  And I talked about Google, talked about Microsoft, talked about Apple, talked about a bunch of examples.
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:55.000]  In this case, I was trying to explain that Apple struggled with services not because they're dumb,
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000]  but because they're so great at products.
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:00.000]  And this is a point, obviously I've returned to this point in the past,
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:05.000]  to say that Apple struggles with services is not to criticize Apple or say they're dumb people.
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:11.000]  It's a recognition that the same things that make Apple the best product company,
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:15.000]  an amazing product company, work against being a great services company.
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:16.000]  Right.
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:17.000]  Anyhow.
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:18.000]  People didn't want to hear it.
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000]  People did not want to hear it.
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000]  So I had just started the daily update then.
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:27.000]  And so my subscriber numbers were in the, I think at that point, I was only a couple months in,
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  so maybe the low hundreds.
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:34.000]  And I got like 20 or 30 unsubscriptions immediately, and people were mad.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000]  And it was shocking.
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000]  I did not expect that to come at all.
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:41.000]  It was good. It was a good lesson to learn.
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  People were caring more about Apple than they did about me.
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:46.000]  And that's fine.
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:47.000]  I have no problem with that.
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:52.000]  And over time, certainly I've come to build up a user base.
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000]  And one of the great things about my model is it's $10 a month.
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:58.000]  So if you want to quit, it doesn't really affect me, my life in the slightest, which is great.
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:01.000]  I actually love that about this model.
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.000]  But yeah, it's funny.
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:13.000]  Whenever I write something that is not purely optimistic about Apple, there is definitely an uptick in people turning off Auto Renew on their subscriptions.
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000]  I've seen it on sports too.
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:21.000]  I follow some Yankees beat writers on Twitter, and every once in a while they'll get in an argument with people.
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:28.000]  And there's a certain flavor of Yankee fan who just doesn't want to hear it, that the Yankees aren't the best team in baseball.
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:32.000]  Now this year, they actually are the best team in baseball.
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:36.000]  But last year, last couple of years, the Yankees haven't been bad.
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:40.000]  They haven't had a losing season, but clearly we're not going anywhere.
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000]  We're not going to win a championship.
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:53.000]  And any kind of sports coverage along the lines of it's not really a great strategy to be paying $27 million to a 41-year-old Alex Rodriguez with a bad hip.
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:59.000]  And the Yankees fans are like, wow, why do you want to write about the Yankees if you hate them so much?
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000]  Like, unfollow.
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:11.000]  And it's like, actually, he's just sort of an expert on baseball, and he's pointing out something that's actually pretty obvious, which is that having old people on your team is not a good way to win at sports.
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:14.000]  Yeah, and it's a great thing for Apple.
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:22.000]  It's one of Apple's really core strengths is the devotion that Apple has fans, right?
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:25.000]  Like, that's not from a business perspective.
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:28.000]  I put my business analyst hat on, and that's amazing.
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:34.000]  And it's something that Apple uses as a tool, as a strategic tool again and again.
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:44.000]  Like, that's how the iPhone, you know, they would go into a country, and they would dictate terms, and the leading carriers would say no.
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:47.000]  And then they'd go to the second place carrier, and often they'd say no.
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  They'd go to the third place carrier, who's desperate to catch up and say, okay, we accept your terms.
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000]  And then the iPhone is on the carrier.
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:57.000]  Like, Japan is probably the classic example of this.
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000]  SoftBank was well in third place.
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:08.000]  And the iPhone is on SoftBank, and people started switching their carriers, which they never did before, to get the iPhone.
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:16.000]  And by and large, particularly at the beginning, they were Apple fans who already loved Apple, loved Apple products, desperately wanted an iPhone, and they switched.
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000]  This happened in the U.S. with AT&T, same thing.
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:26.000]  And over time, then Apple could eventually, now the iPhone is on all the carriers, and it's on Apple's terms with all of them.
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:29.000]  And that's all because of the devotion that people have to Apple.
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:32.000]  It's an amazing tool.
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:37.000]  What a weird duck the Verizon iPhone 4 was, right?
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:41.000]  It's like the only sort of half iPhone that was ever made.
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:47.000]  It's not just like, and we'll get to this in a minute or two, but not like, okay, we've made the iPhone 7 in red.
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:50.000]  I mean, that's just the color.
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000]  It was available in white, though.
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  Because remember, the white phone was super delayed?
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:57.000]  Yeah, but when the Verizon one shipped, the white one still wasn't even out.
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:02.000]  So I think the Verizon one shipped in early February, but it was weird.
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000]  Oh, did I? I thought it was the same time, yeah.
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:05.000]  It was still weird, yeah.
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:08.000]  Yeah, it was like eight months later, and it had a different antenna.
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  It had the modern iPhone 4S antenna design, not the slightly problematic antenna gate one from the GSM version.
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:23.000]  Anyway, what a weird thing.
[02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000]  All right, so let's talk about this.
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:45.000]  So basically, the overall premise is that in China, the user interface, WeChat is so dominant that it reduces sort of the software lock-in that an iPhone has, which makes it more viable to switch.
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:48.000]  At a very sort of high level, that's it.
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:58.000]  I would just kind of tap down one level, which when I talk about the lock-in, it's not just a lock-in in that there's no iMessage or that apps are available on both platforms, which is the case.
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:02.000]  I mean, there's no app that's widely used in China that's not available on Android.
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:11.000]  It's not really an iOS-first sort of environment the way it is in the US, where even still, there will be hot new apps that are iOS-only to start.
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000]  So that's part of it.
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:18.000]  But also, it's not just the apps, it's the interaction, it's the user interface.
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:25.000]  When you're in one app all the time, you're using that app and that's the dominant way that you experience your phone.
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:37.000]  Whereas in the US, yes, we may use Facebook and Uber and PayPal or Square Cash or whatever it might be that are all analogs for WeChat functions.
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:43.000]  But every time you switch an app, every time you use the app switcher, every time you go back to the home screen, that's all interacting with the operating system.
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:48.000]  You're interacting with the operating system constantly outside of China.
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:53.000]  And in China, you're not really interacting with the operating system at all.
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:17:01.000]  So even the little niggling things about moving stuff around is reduced.
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:09.000]  And so the lock-in is not just about an actual on-paper lock-in, it's like in the user experience lock-in is less as well.
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:20.000]  Right. It almost sounds to me like it's used for so much that it's actually a problem that iOS doesn't let you define.
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:25.000]  They don't show the icon anymore, but you know how from the lock screen, you can jump right to the camera by swiping to the side?
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:30.000]  And when they first introduced that feature, they had a little camera icon in the corner, right?
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:33.000]  And I think it used to drag up instead of drag over.
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000]  Like they've changed the interaction.
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:39.000]  But the idea is, here's an app that's so important.
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:44.000]  And obviously camera's a little different than WeChat because camera, it might be a fleeting moment you're trying to capture.
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:53.000]  So being able to get there, it's not just that you use it a lot, but that getting there quickly from a locked phone can be the difference between getting the shot and not getting the shot.
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:18:04.000]  But iOS doesn't let you do things like say, let me put WeChat on my lock screen so I can jump right to WeChat from a locked phone right away.
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000]  Like none of that's configurable.
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:13.000]  And it sounds to me like WeChat is so central to the experience in China that the iPhone would be a better OS if you could.
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:23.000]  Yeah, well, in many respects, all the lock-in things on an iPhone that are occasionally mild irritants here,
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:28.000]  but by and large, the Apple's built-in stuff is usually good enough that it's fine.
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000]  Like you can't switch the default browser.
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:36.000]  You can't switch the default email client or all sorts of that little stuff that can be kind of irritating if you care.
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000]  But at the end of the day, it's not that big a deal.
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:41.000]  In China, it's much more of an irritant.
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:46.000]  I mean, because remember Android there is completely, it's not Google Android.
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:49.000]  They're all like Chinese variants.
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:19:00.000]  And a lot of them offer much more sort of flexibility and little, you know, they just use phones kind of differently than we do here.
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:07.000]  And so in some respects, an iPhone is not just that because you're most using WeChat, the experience is mostly the same.
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:13.000]  In some respects, it's arguably actually worse in a way that it isn't, you know, in other parts of the world.
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:16.000]  Yeah, and that is terrible for Apple.
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:22.000]  And so let's just say this before we get into speculation or analysts, but it's just a fact.
[02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:26.000]  It's the statement of fact that iPhone sales in China are down year over year.
[02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:30.000]  I think in the just completed quarter, they were down 14%.
[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:34.000]  Yeah, in the second year in a row, they were down even more last year.
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:41.000]  Two years in a row. And until then, it was an increase.
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:44.000]  It's a sharp difference. It's almost like a V-shaped curve.
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:49.000]  I think it's fair to say where it was rising very quickly year over year.
[02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000]  And then all of a sudden now it's dropping year over year.
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000]  It wasn't like it had leveled off for a while.
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:57.000]  There's no plateau, really, I don't think.
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:00.000]  And so why? I mean, it's a fact that iPhone sales are down.
[02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:05.000]  It is also, we can't say it's a fact, but there's at least two market research studies.
[02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:12.000]  You found one that was written in Chinese, and then there's another one that Business Insider linked up last year.
[02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000]  I forget who, some U.S. analyst firm.
[02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:21.000]  But both of them found roughly the same thing, which is that in 2016 in China,
[02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:26.000]  iPhone users, people who already owned an iPhone, and if they bought a new smartphone,
[02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:30.000]  only about 50 to 55% of them bought another iPhone.
[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:36.000]  And in the rest of the world, that number ranges from around the mid-70s in Japan
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:42.000]  to the mid-80s in the U.S. and U.K. and the high 80s in Germany.
[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:48.000]  And so we can't say it's a fact that 50% of Chinese iPhone users bought an Android phone last year,
[02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:55.000]  but we can say it's a fact that two market research studies that seem pretty well rigorously performed to me say so.
[02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000]  Right, and it's shown in Apple's numbers, too.
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:02.000]  I mean, there's several data points to triangulate on here.
[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:06.000]  Right, and that's a stunning difference.
[02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000]  One, it's not small.
[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:13.000]  But two, I mean, one of the real points that I talk about going back to those Apple arguments,
[02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000]  you know, back when I first started with Techery,
[02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:21.000]  one of the core things that was critical to understand with the iPhone is that iPhone users bought new iPhones,
[02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000]  and Android users often changed.
[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:29.000]  And if you just play that out in the long run, in a saturated market, that's actually to Apple's favor,
[02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:33.000]  because they're going to keep their users, and they're just going to slowly keep adding other ones.
[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000]  And that's what is actually happening.
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:40.000]  What's so interesting about this core, the iPhone 7, both this quarter and last quarter,
[02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:44.000]  is that if you exclude China, it's a smashing success.
[02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:50.000]  Like, it is still growing, and it's growing nicely, and it's growing in quote-unquote saturated markets.
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:55.000]  And this is exactly, and this is something that I've been writing since way back when,
[02:21:55.000 --> 02:22:01.000]  that actually a saturated market is going to be good for Apple because of this, you know, if you just play out the math.
[02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:07.000]  Tim Cook has made that point, but it's more compelling from you, because he's too droll about it.
[02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:11.000]  You and I were chatting about this, and you completely convinced me.
[02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:17.000]  You made me rethink my take on Apple's just completed quarter.
[02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:21.000]  That it's actually pretty good, except that it's really stinky in China.
[02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:27.000]  Right, and it's good in an understandable, predictable way, right?
[02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:31.000]  It's not like these growing numbers, like, wow, look at Apple growing.
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:34.000]  If you actually think through, and you've talked about it before,
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:38.000]  why advertising would be compelling on mobile because mobile is so important to your life.
[02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:44.000]  Well, if mobile is so important to your life, that means of all the objects, even if you have to save money or cut costs,
[02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:48.000]  what's the one object you're actually going to splurge on?
[02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:51.000]  Probably the object that's the single most important object in your life, right?
[02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:57.000]  And that's the iPhone, that's Apple, and the iMessage thing, and having blue bubbles, and the status that confers to it,
[02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:00.000]  and the fact that people use it all the time, and all that stuff.
[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:06.000]  There's just really no reason to, why would you want to switch,
[02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000]  whereas there are reasons to go in the other direction.
[02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:13.000]  And this has always been the problem of being an OEM, whether it be a Windows OEM that we talked about before,
[02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000]  HP and ThinkPad, what's the difference?
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:18.000]  Same thing with Android. At the end of the day, what's really the difference?
[02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:25.000]  Yes, Samsung is doing some innovative stuff with hardware, but that's not a sustainable advantage,
[02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:30.000]  whereas Apple has always had the software part, and that's so critical.
[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:38.000]  I think that's worth underlining again, just how interesting that observation is, and I'm convinced that it's true.
[02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:45.000]  But if you go back six, seven, the last five, six, seven years, I think that the,
[02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:53.000]  and going to the era you were talking about, where the narrative was that Samsung is coming to eat Apple's lunch
[02:23:53.000 --> 02:24:01.000]  because of some combination of, you can't stay differentiated forever, and the majority,
[02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:06.000]  oh, we saw what happened the last time with Windows and Mac, the majority OS eventually eats the other one.
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:16.000]  And I think part of that narrative at the time, too, though, was that the go-go years were all about expanding the new countries,
[02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:23.000]  and then within those countries expanding the new carriers, like being exclusive on AT&T for four years,
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:27.000]  and now all of a sudden you've got Verizon, and then a year later you had Sprint and T-Mobile,
[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:33.000]  and obviously that was the go-go, the true go-go years of the iPhone were based on that.
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:40.000]  But the narrative was, well, that's over now, and the markets are getting saturated, and that dooms the iPhone.
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:45.000]  I think that you have a really compelling case that saturated markets are actually good for the iPhone.
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:51.000]  Right. The only real danger that the iPhone faces in most of the world is people holding onto their iPhones longer.
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:56.000]  No one, again, outside of China, is really switching away.
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:03.000]  The phones are so good now that you can use a phone for two, three years, whereas maybe before,
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:07.000]  the difference in year-to-year or the difference every two years was so huge.
[02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:16.000]  I remember going from, actually, back when I was poor and a student, I only got a phone every two years,
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:22.000]  so I got the 3G, and then I got the 3GS, because that's when I came back over from the States,
[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:25.000]  and then I iPod touched before then.
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:28.000]  And then I skipped the 4, and I got the 4S.
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:35.000]  I mean, going from the 3GS to the 4S was such an unbelievable leap in every single aspect of the phone.
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:40.000]  The form factor was so superior. You had the retina screen. It was a million times faster.
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:47.000]  It was amazing, whereas going from a 6 to a 7, it's definitely faster.
[02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:52.000]  You feel that, and going back, and the button feels weird and stuff like that.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:59.000]  But at the end of the day, just the delta, from the way it's experienced, is much smaller than it is.
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:03.000]  And this is the case for technology. It's always the case that you get kind of decreasing returns.
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:06.000]  But I'm not going to switch away.
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:10.000]  Yeah, I think that the 4S was right around the time, too,
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:17.000]  where the iPhone was arguably a reasonable point-and-shoot camera in and of itself,
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:20.000]  whereas the 3GS, it was still a cell phone camera.
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:25.000]  It's been so long now, and people take so many pictures on their phones,
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:29.000]  that it's hard to imagine that in the early years that the iPhone's cell phone cameras
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:35.000]  took a second, it was almost like a different medium than a camera photo.
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:38.000]  Well, that's part of how Instagram got off the ground,
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:42.000]  because I think it came out with the 3GS, or right around that,
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:45.000]  and your photos were so bad that the filters weren't just a cool effect.
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000]  They actually made them passable.
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:52.000]  Right, they disguised the lack of optical quality in the originals.
[02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:57.000]  Right, right.
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:00.000]  It was also true, too, in the early years of Instagram,
[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:03.000]  when people were shooting on 3GS or iPhone 4 or something,
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.000]  where people would say, like, "#nofilter,"
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:10.000]  because it was hard to believe if you got a good photo off it.
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:13.000]  Like, seriously, I did not use a photo, and people would be like,
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:17.000]  oh, you know, I filtered it, and they'd be like, yes, you did, this looks too good now, I swear to God.
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000]  The light was nice.
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:22.000]  So anyway, bottom line, something is different for the iPhone in China,
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:28.000]  and it is not good for Apple, and especially if, and I accept it.
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:35.000]  I accept the, what's it called, the rate that people rebuy the same product.
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:39.000]  iPhone users buy a new iPhone. What's that called?
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:40.000]  Retention.
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:44.000]  Yeah, the retention rate is significantly lower.
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:48.000]  And again, it's not catastrophic. It's, you know, 50 to 55% most OEMs.
[02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:52.000]  It's still the best of any OEM in China, by a pretty significant margin.
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:56.000]  Most OEMs would kill for that rate, but that's not good for Apple.
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:00.000]  So something is different, and you and I are in a complete agreement
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:04.000]  that WeChat is obviously the biggest part of that.
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:12.000]  I think that you can't prove it, but it just seems, I can't imagine what else it would be.
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:16.000]  Yeah, and what I think it's hard to really understand is, you know,
[02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000]  because the analogy would be like Facebook.
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:21.000]  Well, Facebook, people spend tons of time on that, blah, blah, blah.
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:28.000]  But the extent to which, you know, Facebook and apps like that are dominant in kind of leisure time and downtime.
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:33.000]  And What WeChat is dominant in all times, and it's not just,
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:36.000]  and the big thing, it's not just on-device times.
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:39.000]  So yes, they're dominant in your social interaction.
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:43.000]  They're dominant in news. They're dominant in, you know, watching all sorts of things.
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  The NBA is on Tencent.
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:49.000]  So they're dominant as far as on-device things,
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:55.000]  but the degree to which you use your phone for the real world is far more extensive in China than it is in the US.
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:59.000]  I mean, China is way ahead in this sort of, they call it O2O, online to offline.
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:02.000]  This whole arena is much bigger, much more well-developed in China.
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:08.000]  So you're using your phone constantly throughout the day to interact with us, and it's all via WeChat.
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:12.000]  So you're really living this app. I mean, government interactions are through this,
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:15.000]  like not just getting cars, paying for food, paying for goods.
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:19.000]  You know, you see there's QR codes everywhere, like the whole thing runs on QR codes.
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:25.000]  And, you know, what's the problem with QR codes is you don't know what app should you use to snap the QR code.
[02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000]  Well, there's no question about which app to use there.
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:34.000]  And so the pervasiveness of WeChat in just your interaction is there's no app,
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:38.000]  there really is nothing outside of China that is comparable.
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:45.000]  And that's good for Apple because Facebook really isn't the same.
[02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:49.000]  Right, like you said, it's like you go out to lunch with your colleagues
[02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:52.000]  and go to like a counter service place and get something.
[02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:57.000]  Like if you're paying with cash, instead of taking out your phone to pay with WeChat,
[02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:00.000]  you look like you're trying to be a hipster or something.
[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:06.000]  Right, I don't want to overstate it because that's more the case in specific areas like Beijing and Shanghai.
[02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:12.000]  And whereas there's lots of parts of China where you still use cash a lot, in the big cities as well.
[02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:17.000]  But the trend is like super strong, and it's in surprising places, right?
[02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:20.000]  You can go to markets and the little old lady will have a phone.
[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:24.000]  I mean like there's no like square sort of thing, it's all via Tencent.
[02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:29.000]  And this gets into a point I made earlier, like the user experience is not just about the user interface.
[02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:34.000]  Like the user interface like Apple Pay is superior, like to make an Apple Pay purchase is so elegant, right?
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:37.000]  You just hold it up and put your thumb on it, it's amazing.
[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:42.000]  But if when you consider the totality of it, where you have to figure out,
[02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:46.000]  oh do you accept Apple Pay and you have to like be awkward and ask and look around and they have to bring it up.
[02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:53.000]  The user, whereas yeah, maybe more clumsy, you have to open an app and get a QR code to show.
[02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:58.000]  But if that's the expectation and everyone does it and everyone is equipped for it,
[02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:03.000]  then yeah, that specific aspect of the UI is inferior,
[02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:09.000]  but the totality of the user experience is far, far superior than another solution.
[02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:16.000]  I was at the liquor store today and I pay with Apple Pay there usually because they have a chip reader
[02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:20.000]  and it's so much, it's worse than it used to be with a credit card.
[02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:23.000]  So they make credit cards worse and slower and Apple Pay is fast.
[02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:27.000]  And it's my neighborhood liquor store and I know that Apple Pay works there
[02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000]  and the guy was like a crotchety old guy.
[02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:35.000]  And I won't go into the long rant about Pennsylvania liquor stores being government owned and operated,
[02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:40.000]  but he was a total government employee and he said, how are you going to pay cash or credit?
[02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000]  And I said, I'll pay Apple Pay.
[02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000]  And he goes, well, you can't do that.
[02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:48.000]  And I thought it meant like the terminal was broken and I looked at it and didn't say anything.
[02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:49.000]  He goes, we don't accept that.
[02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:50.000]  And I said, yes, you do.
[02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:51.000]  Actually, you do.
[02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000]  I was like, I pay with it here in this store all the time.
[02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000]  And he goes, no, you don't.
[02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:58.000]  And he goes, the state won't.
[02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:02.000]  And I was like, I'm telling you, I was just in here yesterday and bought something.
[02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:10.000]  And I just thought, you know what, I am not going to, why am I arguing this?
[02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000]  I was like, I'll pay credit.
[02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000]  That's funny.
[02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:17.000]  You just want to pay credit and then hold up your phone and then stealthily pay anyway,
[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:20.000]  because that will actually happen.
[02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:24.000]  Oh, the other thing, the other point to make about this.
[02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:25.000]  Oh, sorry.
[02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000]  The analogy, we talked a little bit about Microsoft.
[02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:32.000]  I also enjoyed that I just told a story that makes it sound as though I run out of liquor in a day.
[02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:35.000]  I noted that, but I was just going to let it stand.
[02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:36.000]  But I totally noticed what you said.
[02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:37.000]  I was there yesterday.
[02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:43.000]  It actually is true that I was there the day before, but it wasn't so much that I drank myself out of liquor in a day,
[02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:48.000]  but that I'm a very poor planner in terms of knowing what else I might be running low on.
[02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:52.000]  But anyway.
[02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:58.000]  The point to make about how WeChat does so many things, whereas Facebook only does some things,
[02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:03.000]  is what happened back in the day when Microsoft was dominant.
[02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:08.000]  We used lots of apps, and those apps were actually what we used the computer for,
[02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:13.000]  but the reason why Microsoft got all the value and was the most valuable of them all
[02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000]  is they were sort of the commonality.
[02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000]  They all ran on Windows.
[02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:23.000]  And so it was sort of by having lots of disparate apps that Windows itself got all the value.
[02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000]  And the same thing with the iPhone.
[02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000]  Yeah, we actually use apps.
[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:28.000]  We don't use the iPhone.
[02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:31.000]  We spend most of our time inside Facebook, inside whatever it might be.
[02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:37.000]  But they're all running on the iPhone, and we use enough different ones that where's the winch pin?
[02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:42.000]  Where's the squeeze is at the OS level?
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:47.000]  What ended Microsoft's dominance was why Google became dominant.
[02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:52.000]  Because the web, there were so many websites.
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:57.000]  And what became the common? What became the winch point?
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000]  It was Google. It was the search box, right?
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:04.000]  And when everything, when you have a sort of one-to-one relationship
[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:09.000]  between Google and the computer it ran on,
[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:13.000]  the value in sort of the value chain kind of went up the stack,
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:17.000]  where to the new platform where all the sites sort of sat on top of it, right?
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000]  So it went up.
[02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:22.000]  And the analogy of the phone is, as long as you're using multiple apps,
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000]  and multiple apps are important to your day,
[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:28.000]  then the actual value, the point of leverage is the OS.
[02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:34.000]  But once everything consolidates into one app, then that point of leverage skips up a level.
[02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:39.000]  And that is the case in China, and it's not the case in other places, if that makes sense.
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000]  You have to have an app that does everything.
[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:47.000]  If it only did some things, it's not going to steal leverage in a similar way.
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:56.000]  In the Apple's decades-old, almost foundational, literally,
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:03.000]  software wasn't quite as important in the Apple 2 days, or Apple 1 days even, as it is today.
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:10.000]  But it was the marriage of hardware and software that made Apple products different,
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000]  right from the get-go.
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:15.000]  And again, like I mentioned in my writing about your thing,
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:21.000]  Steve Wozniak is venerated and mostly thought of as an hardware engineer,
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000]  because that's what he was, an electrical engineer.
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000]  But he was a software genius, too.
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:30.000]  He'd never written a compiler in his life, and he made the Apple basic.
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:33.000]  He completely created Apple basic from scratch.
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:34.000]  Yeah, it's incredible.
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:38.000]  Put it in a ROM.
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:46.000]  He borrowed somebody's neighbor's HP in a cubicle, borrowed a compiler book,
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:50.000]  and taught himself to write a compiler in a ROM.
[02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000]  I mean, he was a software genius.
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:53.000]  It was a great basic.
[02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:59.000]  It was a great version of basic, and it was right there as soon as you turned the machine on.
[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:04.000]  In that formula of hardware differentiated by proprietary software,
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:10.000]  the software side is way more important to Apple in the long term than the hardware side.
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000]  Right, the hardware is how they monetize it.
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000]  It's a money vehicle.
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:18.000]  Right, and people focus on it because that's the actual thing you buy,
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:25.000]  and certainly tech people concentrate on it because it's easier to do a review of new hardware
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:36.000]  than it is to review slowly evolving software over time.
[02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:39.000]  But the software is way more important than the hardware.
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:43.000]  I mean, you can have something like the Mac Pro that doesn't get updated for four years,
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000]  and it's not going to kill the Mac.
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:51.000]  But if the software was as stagnant as the Mac Pro hardware, it would be a disaster.
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:55.000]  And it almost did kill Apple, right? Back in the 90s.
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:00.000]  And this was going back to why all those people were so wrong about the iPhone.
[02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000]  This is exactly why.
[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:06.000]  They didn't properly value software, and they didn't properly value software
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000]  because Apple didn't charge for it.
[02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:13.000]  But that's what people always fail to not understand about Apple,
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:17.000]  is that the entire reason why they can charge for much of the hardware
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000]  is because the software is different.
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:22.000]  You'd always read reviews, right? There'd be a review way back in the day,
[02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:27.000]  like PC Magazine, like the new Mac Pro, or whatever they were called back then.
[02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000]  And they would compare it to the PC, blah, blah, blah.
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:33.000]  And it was dumb. It was a farce.
[02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:40.000]  Because the reality is, if you're in the market for a Mac, there is no competition.
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:43.000]  How do you make a lot of money? You make a lot of money by having a monopoly.
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:47.000]  Apple has a monopoly. They have a monopoly on their software.
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:50.000]  The only way to get their software is by buying their hardware,
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:53.000]  which lets them charge way more for their hardware
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000]  than anyone else can charge for theirs.
[02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:59.000]  That's why they're the most valuable company in the world.
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000]  And again, a perfect point.
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:08.000]  The only time Apple was ever actually in real trouble in circa 1996 or so
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:15.000]  was when their software stack had been exposed as being antiquated
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000]  and had serious technical problems.
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:22.000]  And you could make a really compelling case.
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:25.000]  In some cases, for some people, not for everybody,
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:31.000]  but for some people it was decidedly a worse platform than the competition.
[02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:37.000]  Oh, I mean, Apple had been slower than PCs for multiple years at that point.
[02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:44.000]  But when you were getting a situation where, I mean, no protected memory.
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:47.000]  Honestly, if you actually cared about the work you were doing
[02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000]  at any given time on your computer,
[02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:54.000]  you were kind of nuts to not use Windows' protected memory,
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000]  like to not use Windows.
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:59.000]  Your computer's crashing all the time.
[02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000]  Mine was not crashing all the time.
[02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:05.000]  But the reason mine wasn't crashing all the time was that I was sufficiently expert.
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:06.000]  You were careful about it.
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:10.000]  Right, sufficiently expert at using a Macintosh that I knew not to install.
[02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000]  I knew what type of stuff not to install.
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:16.000]  And if I did crash and I had MaxBug installed,
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000]  I wasn't like an expert at MaxBug,
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:22.000]  but I could at least see what it was that crashed.
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:25.000]  I could figure out what it was that was causing the problem.
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:31.000]  But the fact that you had to be an expert Mac user to have that ability, though,
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:35.000]  is a problem because it's fine.
[02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:39.000]  Where the Mac is today is a terrific position in that regard,
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:42.000]  where if you want to be an expert and are an expert,
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:45.000]  you can do amazing things that other people can't,
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000]  but that the casual user...
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:48.000]  It's not a necessity, though.
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:49.000]  Right.
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:54.000]  It's absolutely not a necessity just to use the web and check your email
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:57.000]  and find out what's going on on Facebook.
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:01.000]  What really shows how dumb the argument about hardware is
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:05.000]  is that the Mac became more valuable as a product line
[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:08.000]  once its hardware became the same as everybody else.
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:09.000]  Right?
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:10.000]  Exactly.
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:13.000]  Once they started using all standard stuff,
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:16.000]  it was a more valuable product and they sold more.
[02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:20.000]  Yet people went back to the iPhone and said,
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000]  oh, because the hardware, blah, blah, blah.
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:26.000]  It's so funny how people just don't...
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:30.000]  Even today, I think it's mostly the war has been won,
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:35.000]  but even today there's something that people don't get.
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:39.000]  The software is not sold for a dollar and it's the most valuable thing they make.
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:40.000]  Right.
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:45.000]  There was a plan in the 90s before they settled on acquiring Next
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:48.000]  and using Next Step as their operating system of the future,
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:51.000]  but at the point where they were evaluating their options
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:55.000]  and they were thinking about buying the BOS,
[02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000]  that one of the options...
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:00.000]  I think it was Ellen Hancock who was then the chief technical officer,
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:04.000]  which is a position that I don't think anybody even held after her at Apple,
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:07.000]  but I think it was her who endorsed it,
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000]  and if not, I apologize to Ellen Hancock,
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:16.000]  but somebody at Apple seriously investigated using Windows NT as the foundation
[02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:24.000]  and just building a touchwiz, like a Macintosh touchwiz interface on top of NT.
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000]  What touchwiz is to Android that Apple...
[02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:30.000]  Yeah, you just paint a little Apple-like magic on top of it,
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:34.000]  but you can outsource the actual operating system to Windows NT.
[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000]  It would have completely sunk the company.
[02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:39.000]  The company would have been gone in three years.
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000]  Yeah, it had it exactly upside down.
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:44.000]  But doing the exact same thing on the hardware side
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:48.000]  by switching the internals to bog-standard Intel PCs
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:52.000]  that could literally dual-boot into Windows if you wanted them to,
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:56.000]  or still can today, was the best thing that ever happened to Mac hardware.
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:57.000]  Right.
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:01.000]  And so the reason this matters is, and why the iPhone 7 will sell well,
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:05.000]  is if you need a new phone, you're going to buy an iPhone 7, right?
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:08.000]  And it's faster, and it's better, and the camera's better.
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000]  Yeah, maybe it looks the same as the iPhone 6,
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:15.000]  but when that's your only choice, it's not really that big of a deal, right?
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:23.000]  And whereas Android, there's not really any lock in at all.
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:26.000]  Samsung's been trying to create some sort of lock in for years,
[02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:29.000]  and they fail because that's not what they're good at.
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000]  So here's where we disagree.
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000]  We agree that it's a big problem for Apple,
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:38.000]  that WeChat's dominance is more important, more central than iOS.
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:42.000]  So the experience would then lend you belief that more iPhone users
[02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000]  would be willing to switch to Android,
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000]  and we're seeing proof of that, that it's happening.
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:47.000]  Right.
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:50.000]  Where we subtly disagree is that you also think it's a factor
[02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:53.000]  in these declining sales is the fact that the iPhone 7
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:56.000]  looks like a 6 and 6S.
[02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000]  Yeah, and the reason is because...
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:42:59.000]  I agree, and this is the point.
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:03.000]  That's the exact point where my sort of,
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000]  it's definitely contrarian to most people,
[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:08.000]  because I think that most people who opine professionally
[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:12.000]  about the design of phones took that,
[02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:17.000]  emphasized the, wow, it's the same form factor as the last two years,
[02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:22.000]  and that's an inherently negative thing.
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:28.000]  I agree, and the basics, though, I'm not arguing the extreme point
[02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:32.000]  that the iPhone is now in a perfect shape and should never change
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:36.000]  in any dimension or something like that.
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:39.000]  I just think it's less of a factor than you do.
[02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:42.000]  In fact, almost irrelevant in the China case.
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:46.000]  Well, see, so I agree with you in most of the rest of the world,
[02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:49.000]  because at the end of the day, to buy an iPhone
[02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:54.000]  is to buy an iOS delivery device, right?
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000]  At the end of the day, the hardware is a vehicle
[02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000]  to get the software that you want,
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:01.000]  and this is what Apple is and always has been.
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:04.000]  But just set aside Apple for a while
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:07.000]  and think about what drives high-end Samsung sales,
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:12.000]  what drives other high-end vendors in China, Huawei and Apple.
[02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:15.000]  Why would you choose one or the other?
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:18.000]  Well, you're going to choose based on hardware.
[02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000]  You're going to choose what goes into hardware.
[02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000]  Well, some aspect of it is features like the camera,
[02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000]  and which is better or not.
[02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000]  Some aspect of it is the way it looks.
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000]  We're talking about a device that's with you all the time,
[02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000]  your most personal device.
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000]  You pull out, you put it on the table.
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:35.000]  It's something that says who you are.
[02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:39.000]  And part of that is something that looks the same.
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000]  Here's the analogy I would take.
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:45.000]  Think about buying a Mercedes or buying a BMW
[02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000]  or an Audi or whatever you want.
[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:50.000]  Are there differences in how they drive and their performance?
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:51.000]  Yes, of course there are.
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:54.000]  And some people will always only buy a Mercedes.
[02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000]  They'll always only buy a BMW.
[02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000]  And that's the same thing with using, say,
[02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000]  WeChat on a phone or using it on Android.
[02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000]  Some people will only ever buy one of them
[02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000]  because it's still different.
[02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:07.000]  There's some aspect of the experience that is still about iOS.
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:10.000]  And it's not to say that that's not a factor in China.
[02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:13.000]  It still is. It's not as big.
[02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:16.000]  The number of people that actually care about that are fewer.
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:19.000]  But the way some people will choose to buy which car to buy is,
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:23.000]  well, BMW just came out with a new 5 Series.
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:26.000]  But before then, the sales were really bad the previous year. Why?
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000]  Because they've been the same design for five years.
[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000]  And now this year, the sales are really good. Why?
[02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000]  Because they just came out with a new model.
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000]  And it's the same sort of thing.
[02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:37.000]  If it's the old model, maybe you'll buy it
[02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000]  because you just actually like an iPhone that much.
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000]  But maybe you'll buy something else.
[02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000]  And the implication is,
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000]  I'm actually a bit of an optimist in the short term
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000]  because a new iPhone's going to come out.
[02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000]  I think lots of people are going to want to buy it.
[02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:52.000]  My point that it's not relevant, though,
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:56.000]  is that even if there is a spike,
[02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000]  let's just say that the rumors are true
[02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:01.000]  and Apple ships in September
[02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:05.000]  at least one iPhone that's a very distinctly new design.
[02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000]  And maybe all three of them,
[02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:10.000]  somebody came out with a report this week
[02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:14.000]  that the 7 and 7S, or 7S Plus and 7S
[02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:18.000]  are also going to have glass backs,
[02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000]  which I don't want to get down this rattle,
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:21.000]  but it's nonsense.
[02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:24.000]  If it's true that the second tier new phones,
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000]  not the super phone, not the iPhone Pro
[02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:29.000]  that might be $1,200 or $1,400,
[02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:33.000]  but like the ones that are replacing the 7 and 7 Plus,
[02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:34.000]  if they have glass backs,
[02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000]  they're not going to call them the 7S and 7S Plus
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:39.000]  because the S thing only applies to,
[02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000]  looks exactly the same as the last year's
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000]  but with new technology.
[02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:47.000]  If they do that, all three phones would have new names.
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:50.000]  But anyway, that's a different point.
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:53.000]  Let's just say, Apple comes out with exciting new phone
[02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:57.000]  and low and behold, Chinese sales spike again
[02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:00.000]  and there's pretty strong correlation
[02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:04.000]  that hey, new design equals Apple's back in China.
[02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000]  I'll apologize to you.
[02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:11.000]  I'll admit that you were right if it's a noticeable spike
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000]  because it would almost have to be,
[02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000]  it's not just that they'd have to be a spike
[02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000]  but to prove it, I think it would have to mean
[02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000]  that Chinese growth would be even greater
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:20.000]  than the growth everywhere else
[02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:23.000]  from the sale of this new iPhone, right?
[02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000]  The argument here is that the Chinese market
[02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:30.000]  is more sensitive both ways to the hardware design of a phone
[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:33.000]  that when it is new and wow, you've got the best new iPhone,
[02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000]  they're even more willing to buy it
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:36.000]  than the rest of the world
[02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000]  and when they feel like it's stale,
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000]  they're more willing to abandon it.
[02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:43.000]  I feel like that's a fair assessment.
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:44.000]  I do think so.
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:45.000]  I thought you were going to say
[02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000]  that they'd have to sell even more than the iPhone 6
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:48.000]  because I'm not sure.
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:49.000]  Oh, I don't know about that.
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:50.000]  I don't think that's true.
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:51.000]  Right.
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:52.000]  Because there's two parts.
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000]  So one, yes, I do believe that's the case
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:57.000]  and I do think that iPhone growth in China
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000]  will be greater than in other regions of the world
[02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000]  when a new design comes out.
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000]  I do wonder though,
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000]  something that I've been thinking a lot about
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:09.000]  and this is the real bear case for Apple in China
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:14.000]  is the iPhone 6, it wasn't just that it was the big phone.
[02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:17.000]  That's also the first phone that came out on China Mobile
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000]  which is the largest carrier in China
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000]  and at the same time,
[02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:25.000]  you have the continued emergence of a middle class
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:29.000]  that can stretch for a luxury good
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000]  that in the grand scheme of things isn't that expensive.
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000]  I just talked about cars.
[02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000]  To buy a phone is a fraction of the cost
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:38.000]  even if you're buying the very best phone in the world.
[02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:41.000]  So my big question though,
[02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:44.000]  and this is the bear bull case,
[02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:47.000]  the best news for Apple would be exactly what I say
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000]  where there's, I think regardless,
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:50.000]  there's going to be a big jump.
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000]  The question is, was the iPhone 6 a fad?
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:53.000]  You know what I mean?
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000]  Where it was the thing to get
[02:48:55.000 --> 02:49:00.000]  and now luxury goods go through this, right?
[02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:03.000]  At one point it's Louis Vuitton, then it's Chanel,
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000]  then it's like Hermes, then it's Balenciaga
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:06.000]  or whatever it might be.
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:11.000]  Was the iPhone 6 a fad or was it just the thing to get?
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:14.000]  Or I don't think that's the case.
[02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:15.000]  It may be a little bit.
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:20.000]  Or is the iPhone and Apple a luxury good
[02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000]  and an aspirational good, which I do think it is.
[02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:23.000]  And this matters.
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:24.000]  It matters in China.
[02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000]  It matters way more in China than the U.S.
[02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:30.000]  The level of conspicuous consumption in China
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000]  is kind of jarring when you go.
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:38.000]  You can be in some rundown part of town or messy and dirty
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000]  and there's stuff flying around
[02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:43.000]  and there's people walking down the road with Chanel bags.
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:46.000]  It's very different and matters.
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:47.000]  And you pull out your phone,
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000]  you put it on the table at the coffee shop
[02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000]  and even if it's in a case,
[02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000]  you can see what kind of phone it is.
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000]  And it really matters.
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000]  And Apple still has a great brand
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000]  and it still means something that it's an Apple.
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:03.000]  And I think that's why they're still maintaining cells
[02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000]  to the degree that they are.
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:09.000]  And so I'm still relatively bullish.
[02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000]  If you want to be bearish, though, it'd be that,
[02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:12.000]  oh, it was just a fad.
[02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000]  Which I don't think is true, but it's possible.
[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:19.000]  But my point is, going back to the software
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000]  being more important than the hardware,
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:24.000]  what has you attached to the Apple brand
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:25.000]  has to be the software, too.
[02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000]  It's not just that Apple as a company
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:30.000]  needs to be more focused on the software platform.
[02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:33.000]  But if the software platform isn't what's
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:36.000]  primarily keeping you buying iPhones,
[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000]  then you're so much less sticky.
[02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000]  If you really are just concerned,
[02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000]  somebody else can.
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000]  I would argue that the competition
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:47.000]  is way closer to iPhone quality hardware
[02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:52.000]  than Android is to being iOS quality software.
[02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:57.000]  Right, that's absolutely true, but I really do think in China,
[02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000]  and this isn't like a Johnny completely observation.
[02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000]  I made this point three, four years ago
[02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:05.000]  that the big differentiation for Apple in China
[02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000]  has always been the brand.
[02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000]  That matters more.
[02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:12.000]  And one of Apple's actually advantages,
[02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000]  and something they learned with the whole 5C thing,
[02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:19.000]  is having only a high-end brand or a high-end phone
[02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:22.000]  is a good thing because there is no watering down
[02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:23.000]  of the brand, right?
[02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:24.000]  Yes, you can have a high-end Samsung.
[02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000]  There's also low-end crappy ones floating around.
[02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:29.000]  Same thing with all the other Chinese brands.
[02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:33.000]  The fact that an iPhone is always an expensive device
[02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:37.000]  is something that actually helps preserve that.
[02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:40.000]  It's always an expensive device or an old device.
[02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:41.000]  Right.
[02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000]  But it was expensive at some point.
[02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:44.000]  Right.
[02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000]  Okay, so what about the red iPhone?
[02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000]  I didn't mention that in my article.
[02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:49.000]  What about the red one?
[02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000]  Because the red one is obviously new.
[02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:54.000]  People can quibble about whether the jet black iPhone
[02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:57.000]  looks new, but the red one is unmistakably new.
[02:51:57.000 --> 02:52:00.000]  Do you think the red iPhone 7 will make a difference
[02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:03.000]  in the second half of this financial year?
[02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:04.000]  It might.
[02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:08.000]  I think Cook was totally right to say
[02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:11.000]  that there's anticipation for a new device,
[02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:14.000]  which, again, I think that was about China,
[02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:17.000]  that comment, that people are waiting for the new device.
[02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:22.000]  So it might have an impact, but I think it will be muted.
[02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000]  At this point, people are waiting.
[02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:28.000]  And people are super, super up to date on this stuff.
[02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:33.000]  I don't live in China, but I will just say,
[02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:37.000]  being here in Taiwan, iPhone rumors are on the nightly news.
[02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:38.000]  That's amazing.
[02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:39.000]  What was that?
[02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:42.000]  Well, I'm laughing because I realize that in some circles
[02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000]  that's a politically charged sentence,
[02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:47.000]  but I'm also laughing at the fact
[02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:50.000]  that the iPhone rumors are on the nightly news.
[02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:57.000]  Yeah, the pervasiveness of just mobile devices is,
[02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000]  the US is really behind.
[02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:04.000]  They're behind in that because everyone in the US had a PC,
[02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:10.000]  what mobile means in the US is all the times in between
[02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:12.000]  when you're using your PC.
[02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:17.000]  And what happened in China is, for the vast majority of people,
[02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:21.000]  their first computing device is the phone.
[02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:26.000]  And so the reason why WeChat is what it is,
[02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:29.000]  it's not just that it gobbled up all these services.
[02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:30.000]  It didn't even gobble up.
[02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:32.000]  They created them.
[02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:35.000]  Can you use WeChat from a browser?
[02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:36.000]  No.
[02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000]  So is it mobile only?
[02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:43.000]  They have an app for Mac and Windows.
[02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:47.000]  Actually, it's worth downloading because I think it's really interesting.
[02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:48.000]  It drives people to the wall.
[02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:51.000]  People who are used to using PCs, this app drives them to the wall.
[02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:54.000]  But I think if you can understand how the Mac app works,
[02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:56.000]  you'll start to kind of grok this.
[02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:58.000]  So what you do is,
[02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:01.000]  you can download the WeChat app from the Mac Apple Store,
[02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:04.000]  or Mac Apple Store, the Mac App Store.
[02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.000]  And when you launch the app,
[02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:09.000]  what it does is it brings up a...
[02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:10.000]  Let me watch right now.
[02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:11.000]  I haven't watched it in a while, so I should get it.
[02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:15.000]  So you bring it up and it has your picture and you quick log in.
[02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000]  When you quick log in,
[02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000]  you don't actually type a username or password.
[02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000]  It brings up a QR code.
[02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:25.000]  And what you have to do is you have to open the WeChat app on your phone,
[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000]  scan the QR code,
[02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:28.000]  which I'll do it now,
[02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000]  and then, boom, you're logged in on the desktop
[02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.000]  because it sends it up to the WeChat servers that,
[02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000]  yes, this is the right device,
[02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000]  and then you're logged in.
[02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:40.000]  It's honestly worth downloading just to experience this
[02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000]  because if you're a regular PC user,
[02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:43.000]  and I heard from people like,
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000]  oh, man, have you tried using it on the PC?
[02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:46.000]  It's terrible.
[02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:47.000]  What do you mean they have a good user experience?
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:48.000]  Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:52.000]  Well, mainly that app is there for old fogies like you and I
[02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000]  who still want to use a PC,
[02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:59.000]  but it really gets the centrality of mobile.
[02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:03.000]  You have to use your phone to log in on the PC.
[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000]  And once you grok that,
[02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000]  I think you can kind of start to understand
[02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:08.000]  what it means to have mobile
[02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.000]  actually be the center of everything,
[02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000]  not to be a peripheral.
[02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:13.000]  All right.
[02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000]  Here's my other thing I want to get before we wrap this up,
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:18.000]  and I think we're hitting the one-hour mark here.
[02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:20.000]  No.
[02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:21.000]  Two hours.
[02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:22.000]  Nope.
[02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:23.000]  Three.
[02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:24.000]  Three hours.
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:25.000]  All right.
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000]  Well, we can't go over for four.
[02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:28.000]  I got it right.
[02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:33.000]  How do you square this obsession with the appearance of,
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000]  the external appearance of the phones
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:38.000]  with the fact that all around the world,
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:41.000]  majority of users put their phones in cases,
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:44.000]  but in China, it's by all accounts,
[02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000]  it's probably the highest rate
[02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:48.000]  of people putting their phones in cases
[02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:51.000]  because the resale, protecting the,
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000]  it's the whole thing with the people
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:54.000]  not wanting to use the home button
[02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000]  and using the accessibility feature
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.000]  to put a virtual home button on the screen
[02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.000]  because they don't want to wear out the button
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:03.000]  so that it protects the resale value of the phone.
[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000]  So if everybody puts their phone in a case,
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000]  how do you even, you know,
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:10.000]  like the red phone is a perfect example.
[02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:11.000]  You put the red iPhone in a case,
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:12.000]  the button isn't even red,
[02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:16.000]  so there's no way to tell that it's a red iPhone.
[02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:19.000]  Yeah, which is one of the reasons why it might be dampened.
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:24.000]  I think, so there's two aspects of Apple.
[02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000]  It's not just it being a new device.
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:28.000]  It's also the fact that it's an Apple.
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:30.000]  Like, Apple is a meaningful brand.
[02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:33.000]  It is status-conferring brand.
[02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:37.000]  So, and that remains the case and will remain the case.
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:40.000]  Even if you have a case, it's not like you're worried,
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000]  yes, it's not like a purse or something
[02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:45.000]  where you can see across the road that someone has a purse.
[02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000]  You're conveying status not to strangers.
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000]  You're conveying status to the people
[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:50.000]  you're with and around you.
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.000]  So when you sit down at the office
[02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:53.000]  and you pull out your phone,
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:54.000]  you put it on your desk,
[02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:55.000]  or you're in a coffee shop, like I said,
[02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:58.000]  and you pull it out, you can see by,
[02:56:58.000 --> 02:56:59.000]  you can just, even if it's in a case,
[02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:03.000]  you can tell if it's a new phone or not.
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000]  Interestingly, you can't really tell
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:08.000]  if it's a six or if it's a seven,
[02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:12.000]  but you can definitely tell if it's a 5S or a six.
[02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000]  And you could tell the difference between a-
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:18.000]  Or an Android and iOS.
[02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.000]  Right, right, so you still get the Apple status
[02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.000]  because you can see that it's an iPhone,
[02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:26.000]  but there's no status conferring for newness
[02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:30.000]  and the fact that I can afford to buy the newest phone
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.000]  and I have the best phone.
[02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:36.000]  And why buy-
[02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.000]  Yes, if you're rich and you can afford it,
[02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:42.000]  and yes, by all means, buy a new iPhone every year,
[02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:43.000]  but if you're buying an iPhone,
[02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000]  not just because it's an iPhone,
[02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:48.000]  but you want the status that it confers on you,
[02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:50.000]  well, why not keep the iPhone 6
[02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.000]  that looks the exact same as the iPhone 7
[02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:56.000]  and spend what little cash you have?
[02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:58.000]  China is rich, relatively speaking,
[02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000]  especially in the big cities,
[02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:03.000]  but on an absolute dollar basis,
[02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:04.000]  much, much less money,
[02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:06.000]  why not spend that money on buying a new wallet
[02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:08.000]  or something like that?
[02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:09.000]  I've been thinking about it.
[02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:16.000]  I actually think that the prominence of cases that the-
[02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:17.000]  What's the word I'm looking for?
[02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000]  But the fact that cases are so ubiquitous
[02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:25.000]  actually plays against the ways that the iPhone 7 is new
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000]  because you can't see the jet black.
[02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:31.000]  You can't see that it's a red iPhone.
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:32.000]  The color alone-
[02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000]  You can see the dual camera.
[02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000]  Yeah, but that's it.
[02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:37.000]  So there are some changes,
[02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000]  but it's nowhere near as much.
[02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000]  I happen to think,
[02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:45.000]  and I feel like one of the most fascinating things about the-
[02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000]  There's so much rumor and so much speculation
[02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000]  about this year's new iPhones.
[02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:52.000]  It's clearly a higher pitch than usual years
[02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:55.000]  because all the rumors are saying
[02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:56.000]  that it's going to be something new,
[02:58:56.000 --> 02:59:00.000]  and new is more exciting than something that's not new.
[02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:05.000]  And like you said, they're on the nightly news in Taiwan.
[02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:07.000]  But despite the fever pitch of these rumors
[02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:08.000]  that there's something new,
[02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:11.000]  and we hear that it's an edge-to-edge screen and stuff,
[02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:14.000]  there's no actual leaks of what it's going to look like.
[02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:17.000]  That to me, you said you didn't listen,
[02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:19.000]  but Rene Ritchie and I talked about it last week.
[02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:24.000]  It's almost excruciating reading Mark Gurman's stuff at Bloomberg
[02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:28.000]  because it's entirely written around the central point,
[02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:30.000]  which is that Mark Gurman has no fucking idea
[02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:32.000]  what the next iPhone looks like.
[02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:33.000]  None.
[02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:37.000]  And it's really kind of hard to write the story
[02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.000]  where the gist of the story is,
[02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:42.000]  I have no idea what the next iPhone looks like.
[02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:44.000]  And so it's...
[02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:45.000]  There is a little bit.
[02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:48.000]  I mean, recently, isn't there some blueprints that got out,
[02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:50.000]  like the vertical camera and stuff like that?
[02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:51.000]  Supposedly, right?
[02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:53.000]  But they're not consistent.
[02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000]  So the vertically aligned camera.
[02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:59.000]  But I think Gurman did have something about that.
[02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000]  But he wasn't first, though.
[03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:02.000]  I don't think any of that.
[03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:04.000]  I don't think that vertically aligned cameras
[03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:05.000]  came from him first.
[03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:07.000]  I think the plans leaked, and then he just wrote about them.
[03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:10.000]  But then he wrote that it would help the iPhone.
[03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:14.000]  Moving the dual camera from horizontal to vertically aligned
[03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:16.000]  would help the iPhone take better pictures.
[03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:18.000]  No, it wouldn't.
[03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:21.000]  Still two lenses the same distance from each other.
[03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:25.000]  It just changes where they are on the body.
[03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000]  But anyway...
[03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000]  I think that's fascinating.
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:30.000]  Anyway, here's what I think.
[03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:31.000]  Here's my point.
[03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:32.000]  My point is this.
[03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:34.000]  I think Apple is very much aware
[03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:38.000]  of how many people put their phones in cases.
[03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:39.000]  And I think they're very much aware.
[03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000]  And I think that part of the design
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:44.000]  of whatever the next form factor for iPhone is
[03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:46.000]  is very much designed in mind
[03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000]  with the fact that it's going to be in a case.
[03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:51.000]  And I think they started this with the iPhone 6
[03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.000]  because I think it's the only way
[03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000]  that they justified to themselves the camera bump,
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000]  which is that for most users,
[03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000]  the camera bump is irrelevant because they never notice
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000]  because it's in a case, and the case,
[03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:04.000]  even the thinnest case, is thicker than the camera bump.
[03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:06.000]  The camera bump is actually a penalty
[03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:08.000]  for people like me who don't use a case.
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:12.000]  Yeah, I think that's a great point.
[03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:15.000]  And the other thing I think that's really interesting
[03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:18.000]  is this idea of this iPhone Plus or Pro or whatever it is
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:20.000]  that's going to be much more expensive.
[03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:24.000]  To me, this is a very easy...
[03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:26.000]  It's interesting in a lot of respects.
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:29.000]  I think it's a pretty optimal path, actually,
[03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:32.000]  I think, for Apple to grow revenue
[03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:37.000]  because right now,
[03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:40.000]  they haven't tested how high they can go.
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:43.000]  They know they can sell a lot at this price point,
[03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.000]  but the iPhone Plus pushed it up $100,
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:47.000]  and they sold a ton of them.
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000]  They're selling even more than they expected,
[03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:51.000]  and this is the third year in a row they've had the Plus,
[03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:52.000]  and for three years in a row,
[03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:54.000]  they've underproduced the Plus size.
[03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:56.000]  The Plus share of the iPhone
[03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:59.000]  is actually becoming more and more.
[03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:03.000]  And I'm really interested about this new,
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:06.000]  even higher-tier sort of model.
[03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:09.000]  And I think it is something that will play very well
[03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:13.000]  in the China market.
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000]  I think it's a balance, right?
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000]  You don't want to ruin the brand value
[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:22.000]  of the $700 phone.
[03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:25.000]  You are getting pretty darn expensive
[03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000]  once you're going beyond that,
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:30.000]  but the implication of going beyond that
[03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:33.000]  is the sort of status and visibility
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000]  that comes from having that is even greater,
[03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:37.000]  and where do you strike the balance
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:40.000]  between being accessible to enough people
[03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:43.000]  versus getting in a iPhone 5C situation
[03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:49.000]  where it's kind of like there was a gulf in perception
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:51.000]  because you were clearly buying the cheap iPhone, right?
[03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:53.000]  That's going to be very, very interesting
[03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:54.000]  to see how that plays out
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:56.000]  and how far they try to push it.
[03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:58.000]  Yeah, I think that if it's true,
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:00.000]  and Renee was talking about this last week,
[03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:04.000]  Renee seems pretty sold on the idea
[03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:08.000]  that the successors to the 7S and 7S,
[03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:13.000]  or 7 and 7 Plus, I get the S's wrong,
[03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:15.000]  whether they call it the 7S
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:17.000]  or they call it the iPhone 8 or something,
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:19.000]  maybe if it's even newer,
[03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000]  but that they'll be at the same price points
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:23.000]  as the 7 and 7 Plus today,
[03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:26.000]  that this iPhone Pro or whatever you want to call it
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:29.000]  is going to be significantly more expensive.
[03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:31.000]  I think that's the only way to do it.
[03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:33.000]  It's the only way that makes sense,
[03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:36.000]  and I feel like a lot of times you can kind of answer
[03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:39.000]  the criminology of Apple is,
[03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:41.000]  is it going to cause people to lose their shit
[03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:43.000]  the moment it's announced?
[03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:49.000]  Let's say they come out with a replacement
[03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:51.000]  for the 7 and the 7 Plus.
[03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:53.000]  Call it the 7S and 7S Plus
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.000]  just for the sake of this discussion
[03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:56.000]  at the same price points,
[03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:59.000]  and it has reasonably what you expect from Apple
[03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:01.000]  year-over-year technology-wise.
[03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:03.000]  The GPU graph keeps going up on the hockey stick.
[03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:07.000]  The camera has X, Y, and Z that it does better,
[03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:08.000]  and you can take a side-by-side picture
[03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:10.000]  with the year-old camera,
[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:12.000]  and you can see things that are better in the new one,
[03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:14.000]  better battery life maybe,
[03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:16.000]  just typical things like that,
[03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:18.000]  and they have this phone
[03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:21.000]  that is a jaw-dropping physical form factor,
[03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:24.000]  and let's say the starting price is $1,500.
[03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:26.000]  People would lose their fucking shit
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:29.000]  if all of a sudden in this market
[03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:32.000]  of Apple and Samsung and all these super phones
[03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:34.000]  that are in this $700, $800 range,
[03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:35.000]  and Apple just doubles the price
[03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:37.000]  for this new top tier
[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:41.000]  and sells a $1,500 or $1,600 starting point iPhone.
[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:45.000]  Would people lose their shit? Absolutely.
[03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:47.000]  Now, the other tricky Apple thing
[03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:49.000]  that they could be doing is seeding this idea
[03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:52.000]  of a higher than $1,000 starting point
[03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:55.000]  and then just making the new design
[03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:57.000]  at the existing starting points
[03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:59.000]  that the whole thing is some kind of ruse
[03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:00.000]  and that everybody fears
[03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:02.000]  that this new phone is going to be super expensive,
[03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:05.000]  and it turns out to be the same price
[03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:06.000]  as the current ones,
[03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:08.000]  because remember, famously,
[03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:11.000]  the iPad was leaked to the Wall Street Journal
[03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:13.000]  at $1,000, and it started at $499.
[03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:17.000]  That was amazing because it worked so well.
[03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:19.000]  People were blown away
[03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:21.000]  at how inexpensive this device was
[03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:24.000]  because they had set the expectations.
[03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:25.000]  Jobs had talked it up,
[03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:28.000]  sufficiently talked it up during the keynote,
[03:05:28.000 --> 03:05:30.000]  lounging in his nice little chair,
[03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:33.000]  that it easily sounded like he was going to say,
[03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:34.000]  this thing is so freaking great,
[03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:37.000]  you're going to love spending $1,000 on this,
[03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:38.000]  and it was half the price.
[03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:40.000]  But anyway, I could see them doing it both ways.
[03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:43.000]  I would have to say that in the post-Steve Jobs world,
[03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:46.000]  it's more likely that they're going to sell it for $1,500.
[03:05:46.000 --> 03:05:50.000]  Yeah, people would definitely lose their minds on that.
[03:05:50.000 --> 03:05:52.000]  The other thing that's interesting,
[03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:54.000]  I wonder if the high end is there's going to be,
[03:05:54.000 --> 03:05:56.000]  do you think there will be a pencil sort of thing,
[03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:59.000]  like the Samsung Note?
[03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:01.000]  I mean, that would be a way to differentiate it
[03:06:01.000 --> 03:06:02.000]  and call it Pro.
[03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:04.000]  It kind of matched the iPad Pro naming.
[03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:05.000]  I don't know.
[03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:06.000]  I don't know.
[03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:07.000]  I can't see them doing a pencil for it,
[03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:11.000]  or if they did, it would just be the regular pencil, right?
[03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:12.000]  I don't know.
[03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:13.000]  Yeah, where it has pencil support,
[03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:15.000]  as opposed to having something built in.
[03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:16.000]  Yeah, it could be.
[03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:17.000]  It could be the pencil.
[03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:18.000]  I don't know.
[03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:21.000]  I mean, the pencil support in the device
[03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:25.000]  obviously costs enough money that they didn't put it in
[03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:30.000]  the quote, unquote, new iPad 9.7 inch.
[03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:32.000]  Well, it's also a very strong differentiator, too.
[03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:35.000]  I mean, it's a very clear thing that this more expensive device
[03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:37.000]  does this, this cheaper device does not.
[03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:40.000]  I could see them tossing, if they started at like $1,400,
[03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:45.000]  $1,500, $1,600, I could see them putting AirPods in the box.
[03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:50.000]  Yeah, that would blow my mind if it was $1,500.
[03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:54.000]  I was thinking maybe like $1,000 or something like that.
[03:06:54.000 --> 03:06:55.000]  Maybe you're right.
[03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:56.000]  Maybe they'll go all out.
[03:06:56.000 --> 03:06:58.000]  I think it makes a lot more sense.
[03:06:58.000 --> 03:06:59.000]  In fact, I think it has.
[03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:00.000]  If you're going to go for it, go for it.
[03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:01.000]  Well, here's my argument.
[03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:03.000]  I've been thinking about this an awful lot,
[03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:05.000]  is if it's only $100 more expensive,
[03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:07.000]  like going from the 7 to the 7 Plus,
[03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:10.000]  like getting plus-sized with the otherwise same components
[03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:12.000]  is a $100 upgrade, right?
[03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:14.000]  Or is it a little more than $100, like $120 or something?
[03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:16.000]  Yeah, they did raise the price.
[03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:18.000]  And I think that was a lesson for Apple, too.
[03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:20.000]  They raised the price, and it didn't matter.
[03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:23.000]  They actually sold even more pluses this year
[03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:25.000]  than last year, relatively speaking.
[03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:27.000]  I think it has to be so much more expensive
[03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:30.000]  that it keeps people from buying it, that people say,
[03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:31.000]  there's no way I'm buying it.
[03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:32.000]  I love it.
[03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:35.000]  It looks amazing that I'm not spending $1,600 on an iPhone.
[03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:41.000]  And therefore, it can ship in much lower quantities.
[03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:44.000]  Because if it's only $100 more, everybody would buy it.
[03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:47.000]  Everybody, or not everybody, but an enormous number
[03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:49.000]  of people who would have otherwise bought
[03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:53.000]  the second level, the new phones that are a level down,
[03:07:53.000 --> 03:07:56.000]  they're all just going to get the one that's more expensive.
[03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:58.000]  It can't just be $100 more expensive
[03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:02.000]  if they're really doing three new phones.
[03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:03.000]  Yeah.
[03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:07.000]  Yeah, the whole Apple pricing curve is really fascinating
[03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:10.000]  because, again, it's a monopoly, right?
[03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:13.000]  If you want iOS, you only have one choice.
[03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:18.000]  So the optimal, where does Apple find the right line
[03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:24.000]  between maximizing profit, which, by the way,
[03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:26.000]  the maximizing profit price is always
[03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:31.000]  going to be higher than what it would be in a more competitive,
[03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:32.000]  well, obviously.
[03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:33.000]  Right.
[03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:34.000]  You're going to sell fewer devices,
[03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:36.000]  but your total profit's going to be more.
[03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:40.000]  Yeah, but they've never, I said before,
[03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:41.000]  they've never really pushed the high end.
[03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:42.000]  But you're right.
[03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:44.000]  With the Plus, they already did push up $100,
[03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:46.000]  and they pushed up another $30.
[03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:50.000]  And it has not only, in its increased sales,
[03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:52.000]  it hasn't decreased them, which is, like,
[03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:54.000]  how much more headroom might they have?
[03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:56.000]  It might be a lot, and I think it makes a lot of,
[03:08:56.000 --> 03:08:58.000]  the more I think about it, the more I think it's going to be,
[03:08:58.000 --> 03:08:59.000]  you know, who knows?
[03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:01.000]  Maybe it'll be $2,000.
[03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:02.000]  I don't know.
[03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:04.000]  Maybe it'll be crazy expensive because they're
[03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:06.000]  going to put stuff into it that they cannot,
[03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:10.000]  they can't put in a $700 phone and or, you know,
[03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:14.000]  cost-wise, and or they simply cannot make in sufficient quantity.
[03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:16.000]  There's, you know, they sold, I think,
[03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:19.000]  77 million phones in the holiday quarter last year,
[03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:22.000]  something like that, 70-some million.
[03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:25.000]  What if there's some kind of cool new technology,
[03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:27.000]  but they can only reasonably expect to get maybe
[03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:30.000]  5 million of them in the first quarter?
[03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:32.000]  You know, then they'd have to,
[03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:36.000]  they can either not make the device and stick to what they can make
[03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:41.000]  in quantities like 70 million, or they could price the device
[03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:45.000]  at a point where 5 million would be closer to where
[03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:47.000]  supply and demand meet.
[03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:48.000]  Yeah.
[03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:51.000]  Or it could just be that they want to make more money.
[03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:52.000]  I mean...
[03:09:52.000 --> 03:09:54.000]  Well, remember, too, this is the company that sold
[03:09:54.000 --> 03:09:56.000]  $20,000 gold Apple watches.
[03:09:56.000 --> 03:09:59.000]  I mean, it's, you know, and they still, you know,
[03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:00.000]  they have the edition now.
[03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:03.000]  I mean, and, you know, if they called it the iPhone edition,
[03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:06.000]  maybe they'll charge $2,500 for it.
[03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:07.000]  I don't know.
[03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:08.000]  And maybe it will be ceramic.
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:11.000]  I mean, I can't remember what his name is.
[03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:13.000]  The guy who writes those brilliant machine articles.
[03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:17.000]  Yeah, he kind of shot down the whole ceramic iPhone thing.
[03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:20.000]  And, you know, a big part of his point was about volume.
[03:10:20.000 --> 03:10:23.000]  Like, there's no way, if they were actually going to do this at volume,
[03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:25.000]  one, it'd be almost impossible, but two,
[03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:27.000]  like, we would definitely know about it.
[03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:32.000]  But if it's a limited edition $1,500,
[03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:37.000]  $1,800 phone, well, Apple could probably pull that off much more easily.
[03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:39.000]  They're already making the watch.
[03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:40.000]  Right.
[03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:43.000]  It's not even, it could be something that sells in so few quantities
[03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:45.000]  because it has to because, like, maybe it's ceramics,
[03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:48.000]  maybe it's these OLED screens, whatever else the thing may have.
[03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:49.000]  I don't know.
[03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:51.000]  What if it costs $3,000?
[03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:55.000]  And this, the Apple II edition, so my wife actually has it.
[03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:56.000]  It looks good.
[03:10:56.000 --> 03:10:59.000]  I think it looks, I mean, better than the,
[03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:00.000]  the gold ones just looked wrong.
[03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:01.000]  Yes, I agree.
[03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:06.000]  But the white ceramic with, it looks really, really good.
[03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:09.000]  And it pairs with all the straps and it looks fantastic.
[03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:13.000]  A phone that looked like that would be, would be, it'd be hot.
[03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:14.000]  Yeah.
[03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:17.000]  It looks somehow to me, I've always been a fan of the black phones.
[03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:22.000]  And to me, I just don't like the way that the black rectangle
[03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:25.000]  of the screen looks surrounded by a white bezel.
[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:26.000]  I don't like it on an iPad.
[03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:27.000]  I just don't.
[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:28.000]  It's a personal thing.
[03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:32.000]  Whereas on that, the additional watch, the way that the black
[03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:35.000]  and the white integrate, because it's not really a black rectangle
[03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:38.000]  surrounded by white, it's that black sapphire piece on top
[03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:39.000]  with the black screen.
[03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:42.000]  It looks really good.
[03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:43.000]  Yeah.
[03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:46.000]  It may just, a watch usually kind of has an offset color
[03:11:46.000 --> 03:11:47.000]  for the watch face anyway.
[03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:50.000]  So it maybe fits your sort of expectations for the wrist.
[03:11:50.000 --> 03:11:52.000]  Anyway.
[03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:55.000]  So watch this become like Business Insider, the headline tomorrow.
[03:11:55.000 --> 03:12:00.000]  John Gruber says iPhone edition's going to cost $3,000.
[03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:02.000]  Now, right?
[03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:06.000]  I'm literally, nobody has ever, I have no source on this whatsoever.
[03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:07.000]  I'm just speculating.
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:10.000]  I'm just saying it wouldn't shock me.
[03:12:10.000 --> 03:12:16.000]  And I would relish the, I would just love the post keynote reaction.
[03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:17.000]  Yeah.
[03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:20.000]  And I mean, I'm talking myself into my own self-created rumor,
[03:12:20.000 --> 03:12:23.000]  but this idea of it being a, being ceramic,
[03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:28.000]  being a different material, I think would really help them pull it off.
[03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:30.000]  Is anybody talking about the material of the phone?
[03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:31.000]  I don't think that they are.
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:33.000]  And they're talking about glass backs,
[03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:37.000]  but the glass back rumor seems to be about the, you know,
[03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:39.000]  regular level new iPhones.
[03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:40.000]  Right.
[03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:42.000]  And it's a way to get away with selling, again, I think,
[03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:44.000]  like I think this high-end phone is going to like be,
[03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:47.000]  would be a huge hit in China for all these status sort of conferring reasons
[03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:49.000]  I just discussed.
[03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:52.000]  And this is a way to get away with that without,
[03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:55.000]  because I was thinking about the whole pencil thing. Right.
[03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:57.000]  And I don't think Apple wants to do that on the phone either.
[03:12:57.000 --> 03:12:59.000]  I was trying to think about the, what is going to be the,
[03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:04.000]  what's going to be the sell to justify it being so much more expensive.
[03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:08.000]  Whereas if it's a completely different material in the case, you know,
[03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:11.000]  I think that's, you could,
[03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:13.000]  especially since they already set the precedent with the watch, right.
[03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:15.000]  How much does the edition cost like 1200 or something.
[03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:19.000]  So it's, it's, it's four times as much as the, as the base watch.
[03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:23.000]  And much more, a much more reasonable spread in price,
[03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:26.000]  I would say than the, the, the original edition to say the least.
[03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:28.000]  And you could see a similar thing.
[03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:31.000]  I think that it would be a, they could pull that off.
[03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:33.000]  People would be less, they would lose their shit.
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:36.000]  They would lose, I can't even square properly.
[03:13:36.000 --> 03:13:38.000]  They would lose their shit because the price is so high.
[03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:39.000]  Right.
[03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:40.000]  But it wouldn't be like,
[03:13:40.000 --> 03:13:43.000]  how on earth are they can even contemplate just like this.
[03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:46.000]  Like, wow, they actually, they actually went there as opposed to,
[03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:48.000]  I don't understand this doesn't make any sense.
[03:13:48.000 --> 03:13:49.000]  Right.
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:51.000]  And then I guarantee you that the thing I've decided it too,
[03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:54.000]  I think it's such a lovely, lovely.
[03:13:54.000 --> 03:13:55.000]  A little quote,
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:59.000]  but the Andy Warhol quote about Coke being like the greatest American
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:03.000]  product, because there's just one type of Coke and it's the best.
[03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:04.000]  It's the best soda.
[03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:07.000]  And you know that the bum on the street drinks,
[03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:11.000]  the exact same Coke that the president drinks that Liz Taylor drinks,
[03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:13.000]  nobody else, you know, nobody can get a better Coke.
[03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:14.000]  Um,
[03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:19.000]  and like with the Apple watch, I got so much stuff from readers who are like,
[03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:22.000]  this is a complete violation of Apple's principles because Apple's always
[03:14:22.000 --> 03:14:27.000]  been like Coke in that regard where you can get the, uh, you know,
[03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:30.000]  you can get the best phone in the world and you pay the same that people
[03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:31.000]  buy for other phones. You know,
[03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:34.000]  president of the United States can't get a better cell phone than,
[03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:37.000]  than you can. But if you're going to sell it for three or $4,000,
[03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:41.000]  then all of a sudden you're, you know, cutting people off from the best.
[03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:45.000]  But trust me, Apple's already, Apple's already crossed that.
[03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:47.000]  Well, no, but they didn't though,
[03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:49.000]  because the low end watch was still the same.
[03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:52.000]  You could get the exact same functionality and that because Apple at the end
[03:14:52.000 --> 03:14:55.000]  of the day is a software company. Right. And, and,
[03:14:55.000 --> 03:15:00.000]  but this was so interesting is what if maybe this high end phone,
[03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:02.000]  there are no other differences, right?
[03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:05.000]  Like maybe the hardware is completely the same. It's just material.
[03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:06.000]  And what, what the,
[03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:10.000]  cause the problem is Apple's market in China is just different than the rest
[03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:13.000]  of the world. So again, I think if they do this,
[03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:17.000]  I really think it's a China thing because in China they are competing on brand
[03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:21.000]  and status. So in that case, you don't want to be Andy Warhol.
[03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:23.000]  You don't want to be anywhere else. Coke.
[03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:27.000]  You want to be able to create a special Coke that people will pay lots of money
[03:15:27.000 --> 03:15:31.000]  to get. And like I said, square that circle.
[03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:35.000]  I've tossed the, I've tossed it out where defending even I,
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:38.000]  obviously it was a mistake. I don't think it was wrong to try though with the
[03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:43.000]  solid gold edition. And I think the ceramic is a terrific, uh,
[03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:47.000]  second stab at the same idea. Um, but to me,
[03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:50.000]  it's not that you're getting a better Coke. It's the exactly like you said,
[03:15:50.000 --> 03:15:51.000]  like, you know,
[03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:54.000]  cause of the software and because the CPU is the same and everything,
[03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:58.000]  it's more like drinking your Coke out of a very fancy goblet as opposed to the
[03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:01.000]  bomb on the street is drinking it out of the can.
[03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:03.000]  It's just both getting the same Coke,
[03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:06.000]  but the person drinking it out of the, you know,
[03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:10.000]  gold rim goblet is, you know, paid for the wrapper. Uh,
[03:16:10.000 --> 03:16:13.000]  one thing that would be different would be the display cause every,
[03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:16.000]  all the rumors point to, to the, you know,
[03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:21.000]  the two regular new iPhones having the same size 4.7 and 5.5 inch displays and
[03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:25.000]  the 5.8 inch super fancy, you know,
[03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:27.000]  edge to edge display would be on the new one.
[03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:30.000]  But I wouldn't be surprised if it has the exact same system on a chip and same
[03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:34.000]  Ram and same storage and stuff like that. Well, I, I, yeah,
[03:16:34.000 --> 03:16:36.000]  I don't know. I see. I've all,
[03:16:36.000 --> 03:16:41.000]  I've always been skeptical of the seven S and seven S plus having the same four
[03:16:42.000 --> 03:16:45.000]  factor as the seven and there being a new form factor at the very high end
[03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:49.000]  because we already saw how that plays out with the, with the, with the five C.
[03:16:49.000 --> 03:16:51.000]  It's like, it's, well,
[03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:54.000]  I didn't say same form factor and the rumors don't say same form factor.
[03:16:54.000 --> 03:16:58.000]  The rumors just say same screen sizes. Got it. Oh yeah.
[03:16:58.000 --> 03:17:00.000]  We'll see. I mean, I,
[03:17:00.000 --> 03:17:04.000]  I do this as pure speculation as I think we said at the beginning,
[03:17:04.000 --> 03:17:08.000]  but we could say it again, I completely making this stuff up. Uh, but I, yeah,
[03:17:08.000 --> 03:17:11.000]  it seems to just seem to make much more sense to me that the only
[03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:14.000]  differentiation being materials, but maybe you're right. Maybe,
[03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:18.000]  maybe it's bigger and bigger is better in China is also, we'll note.
[03:17:18.000 --> 03:17:21.000]  I mean this, the people,
[03:17:21.000 --> 03:17:24.000]  you can care about getting like a small form factor,
[03:17:24.000 --> 03:17:28.000]  like the SE phone if you're not using your phone for everything, right?
[03:17:28.000 --> 03:17:32.000]  That, that almost comes with the presumption that you're using a PC regularly.
[03:17:32.000 --> 03:17:36.000]  If you're or an iPad or whatever, if you want a smaller phone, uh,
[03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:40.000]  if the phone is actually what you use all the time and it's the key to your
[03:17:40.000 --> 03:17:44.000]  life and everything that you do, both inside the house and outside the house,
[03:17:44.000 --> 03:17:46.000]  you want a bigger, if you want a bigger screen, like there's just no,
[03:17:46.000 --> 03:17:48.000]  there's no ifs, ends or buts about it.
[03:17:48.000 --> 03:17:51.000]  All right. Ben Thompson.
[03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:53.000]  Todd Visserie is going to be very happy.
[03:17:53.000 --> 03:17:57.000]  Todd Visserie is the talk show listener who periodically charts, uh,
[03:17:57.000 --> 03:18:01.000]  episode links over time.
[03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:05.000]  Usually whenever I post a long episode, he usually, he usually DMS me.
[03:18:05.000 --> 03:18:09.000]  I thought just a thumbs up, no, no context, no reference. I just get it.
[03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:12.000]  I get a thumbs up from Todd Visserie. That's funny.
[03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:16.000]  I predict this will be a thumbs up episode. Uh, everybody can read you and your,
[03:18:16.000 --> 03:18:20.000]  your fine, uh, work at a Stratechery.
[03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:23.000]  Just, just search for Ben Thompson on Google for Ben Thompson.
[03:18:23.000 --> 03:18:27.000]  I think one of the first times I was on, I misspelled Stratechery.
[03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:31.000]  And I think I went and bought the misspelled domain because I spelled it wrong
[03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:35.000]  and then I directed it to my site. Uh, yeah, just search for Ben Thompson.
[03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:38.000]  You can't go wrong. And we've got, uh, at Ben Thompson on Twitter,
[03:18:38.000 --> 03:18:42.000]  a fine Twitter account. And then there's also your no tech Ben Twitter account
[03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:45.000]  where you tweet about the, uh, the NBA.
[03:18:45.000 --> 03:18:48.000]  Who do you think is going to win the NBA this year?
[03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:52.000]  Oh, warriors. I think they're the very heavy favorites. I mean,
[03:18:52.000 --> 03:18:56.000]  it would be amazing and phenomenal if, if the Cavs are able to knock them off.
[03:18:56.000 --> 03:18:58.000]  But I mean, I think they have to be the, oops,
[03:18:58.000 --> 03:19:01.000]  they have to be the very heavy favorites. What's going on with the Spurs?
[03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:05.000]  Why are the Spurs struggling? Well, the problem, the, the,
[03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:09.000]  the problem with the Spurs at a very high level is they don't have very dynamic
[03:19:09.000 --> 03:19:12.000]  guard play because their guards got old and now Tony Parker's injured, uh,
[03:19:12.000 --> 03:19:17.000]  which is very sad. But the, I think another problem is the Spurs system is so,
[03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:21.000]  uh, their system is so amazing and everyone plays well and they always have
[03:19:21.000 --> 03:19:24.000]  amazing bench units. And I think a lot of the reason in the regular season,
[03:19:24.000 --> 03:19:27.000]  they're just better prepared and deeper than all the other teams. So they,
[03:19:27.000 --> 03:19:30.000]  they just win lots of games because of the system.
[03:19:30.000 --> 03:19:34.000]  The problem is when you get to the playoffs, the rotations become shorter.
[03:19:34.000 --> 03:19:36.000]  You play fewer players. Sometimes you play too few.
[03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:40.000]  Like I think the Spurs won last night because the Rockets just got too tired.
[03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:44.000]  They only played seven people, seven players. But once you get the playoffs,
[03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:45.000]  the it's,
[03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:49.000]  it's not the median versus the median whereas the regular season is kind of
[03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:52.000]  like the system in the playoffs. It's the best versus the best.
[03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:54.000]  You're playing your best guys. They're playing more minutes.
[03:19:54.000 --> 03:19:58.000]  You're expressly game planning for your opponent and attacking their weaknesses
[03:19:58.000 --> 03:20:00.000]  and picking on them again and again and again.
[03:20:00.000 --> 03:20:03.000]  And so the playoffs are just so very different than the regular season that I
[03:20:03.000 --> 03:20:07.000]  think they have a hard time going up to another level because they're already at
[03:20:07.000 --> 03:20:08.000]  such a high level. Uh,
[03:20:08.000 --> 03:20:13.000]  the intensity is so much higher that it tends to keep the games closer and then
[03:20:13.000 --> 03:20:16.000]  you get in the fourth quarter and it really just comes down to, you know,
[03:20:16.000 --> 03:20:18.000]  your best five or six against the other best five or six.
[03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:19.000]  Yeah. Well,
[03:20:19.000 --> 03:20:22.000]  even just the whole game because a lot of Spurs in the regular season in like
[03:20:22.000 --> 03:20:24.000]  that second and fourth quarter when the bench units are in,
[03:20:24.000 --> 03:20:28.000]  they'll often blow the game open. But in the, in the playoffs, the, the,
[03:20:28.000 --> 03:20:33.000]  those time periods are very, very short. Um, so I mean the Spurs,
[03:20:33.000 --> 03:20:37.000]  the Spurs are amazing. They, they've won four or five titles. People, uh,
[03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:41.000]  think five titles in the last, you know, whatever number of years. The NBA,
[03:20:41.000 --> 03:20:43.000]  it's unbelievably difficult to win a title.
[03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:47.000]  Like four teams account for like 70% of all the titles because
[03:20:47.000 --> 03:20:48.000]  they've just,
[03:20:48.000 --> 03:20:53.000]  it's so dependent on having the best player that a best player or a
[03:20:53.000 --> 03:20:57.000]  collection of best players just dominates for, for, for a long time. Right. Uh,
[03:20:57.000 --> 03:21:00.000]  but the Spurs have also in that time period, they've won a lot.
[03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:04.000]  They've also lost a lot even when they're the higher seed. And I think, uh,
[03:21:05.000 --> 03:21:07.000]  it's because of this, they're great.
[03:21:07.000 --> 03:21:11.000]  They perform at such a high level with such consistency that they dominate the
[03:21:11.000 --> 03:21:16.000]  regular season again and again. But that is less meaningful in a playoff context.
[03:21:16.000 --> 03:21:21.000]  Uh, do you think the warriors lose a game before the finals? Uh,
[03:21:21.000 --> 03:21:26.000]  I, I don't, I think if I,
[03:21:26.000 --> 03:21:29.000]  uh, I think it would take an injury or something. Somebody's gonna,
[03:21:29.000 --> 03:21:31.000]  somebody would have to get, I think the way they're playing now,
[03:21:31.000 --> 03:21:34.000]  there's no one in the West who's going to win a game from it. Yeah.
[03:21:34.000 --> 03:21:35.000]  The,
[03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:40.000]  probably the best bet is Houston gets there and they just make like 33 is in a
[03:21:40.000 --> 03:21:45.000]  game. Right. Um, and just, just through sheer shooting.
[03:21:45.000 --> 03:21:49.000]  So I think it'd be, that'd be a reasonable bet. Um, but yeah,
[03:21:49.000 --> 03:21:52.000]  there was that game a few months ago, again, the regular season.
[03:21:52.000 --> 03:21:54.000]  So don't can't take too much from it, but where, uh,
[03:21:54.000 --> 03:21:58.000]  the Spurs jumped out like a 25 to three lead on the war years and the warriors,
[03:21:58.000 --> 03:22:02.000]  uh, ended up winning by like 15. That's right. It was like,
[03:22:02.000 --> 03:22:05.000]  it was just the moral. It had to be demoralized for the Spurs is demoralizing
[03:22:05.000 --> 03:22:09.000]  as a basketball fans. Like, yeah, it's, it's over. All right.
[03:22:09.000 --> 03:22:13.000]  I look forward to, uh, seeing you next month in person. Yes, I will.
[03:22:13.000 --> 03:22:15.000]  I will see you soon.
