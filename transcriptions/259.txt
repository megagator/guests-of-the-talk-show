[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Don't remember if I was barefoot last year
[00:03.960 --> 00:09.660]  I'm pretty sure if if this is not the first podcast I've recorded barefoot. This is the second I
[00:10.520 --> 00:12.580]  feel like at the beach you kind of have to be like
[00:13.000 --> 00:18.160]  Because you know everything the beach you're constantly going internet between like sandy and wet and dry and it's hot
[00:18.480 --> 00:22.360]  So your only choices are barefoot or full shoes
[00:22.360 --> 00:26.280]  I think like everything in between is not as good like you a flip-flop man
[00:26.280 --> 00:31.880]  Not really. I they don't stay on like I'm a big about like walking like I take long dog walks
[00:31.880 --> 00:34.380]  I take bike rides and they just don't stay on
[00:34.600 --> 00:38.600]  Enough for that like unless you get the kind that are basically sandals if I have a little back strap
[00:38.600 --> 00:42.240]  But that's at that point. That's a sandal. I like a flip-flop. I do feel though that
[00:44.120 --> 00:50.360]  Tiring he's got it. You got to do a little curl with your toes. Yeah, like kind of all the time and you
[00:51.680 --> 00:53.680]  You know, this is a bicycle town
[00:53.680 --> 01:00.280]  I I terrified of riding a bicycle with flip-flops because I feel like I'm on the verge of scraping my toes up
[01:00.560 --> 01:05.120]  Yeah, it's I mean like it's not quite as bad as like riding a motorcycle flip-flops would be but it's not that much better
[01:08.240 --> 01:10.240]  My show has been very erratically
[01:10.640 --> 01:15.520]  More erratic than usual publishing wise I just posted 258 yesterday
[01:15.520 --> 01:21.720]  But I need another July episode and I like to do these shows here in person. So here we are recording again
[01:21.720 --> 01:25.160]  In the middle of the season when there's not much news
[01:25.800 --> 01:31.400]  Yeah, well we say that every summer we say like oh, it's you know, there's not much news in July and August
[01:31.400 --> 01:35.600]  So we better stretch it out and you know do like Q&A episodes like I did and stuff like that
[01:35.600 --> 01:38.920]  But it's like actually a lot of stuff seems to be happening every summer. Yeah
[01:40.760 --> 01:45.960]  One of the things I definitely wanted to talk about before we get into rambling territory is I wanted to talk about the
[01:45.960 --> 01:49.960]  The purported 16-inch MacBook Pro
[01:50.720 --> 01:53.000]  Because there was a I'm sure you saw it
[01:53.640 --> 02:00.000]  But there was a report out of the supply chain that I think it still suggested that it was coming in October
[02:00.400 --> 02:02.400]  Which is a little weird
[02:03.880 --> 02:10.800]  But that it was going to start at $3,000 which would be really weird because right now the 15-inch MacBook Pro starts at
[02:11.200 --> 02:13.200]  $2,400
[02:13.200 --> 02:19.320]  Yeah, I mean, I don't know how much we can trust rumors from like supply chain sources about pricing
[02:19.320 --> 02:25.720]  I think I had two thoughts on that one. Why trust the supply chain on that? They don't know names either
[02:26.000 --> 02:28.500]  Yeah, like pricing and naming it's it's so
[02:29.020 --> 02:35.640]  Well guarded the vast majority of the time like there there's almost always pricing guesses about or you know
[02:35.640 --> 02:40.000]  Alleged pricing leaks or rumors before new products are announced and they're usually wrong
[02:40.000 --> 02:44.220]  Like if you look at like the track record of Apple rumors, I feel like pricing is one of those areas
[02:44.220 --> 02:47.460]  Where we take a lot of guesses about pricing and we're wrong a lot
[02:47.840 --> 02:53.320]  The other way they could do it though is it could be $3,000 and they could just Tim Cook it by keeping
[02:53.880 --> 02:55.880]  the $2,400 one around
[02:56.840 --> 03:01.000]  And so there'd still be a twenty four hundred dollar fifteen inch MacBook Pro
[03:01.000 --> 03:07.120]  But it would be like a year-old model, but that seems like a weird way to go with the MacBook Pro
[03:07.120 --> 03:12.040]  It's you know, that's like a MacBook Air move. Well, so if we look at the rumors holistically
[03:12.680 --> 03:17.640]  Like, you know all the rumors are going around about this, you know upcoming alleged generation of laptops
[03:17.640 --> 03:23.280]  I think I think they all seem to agree on on one big thing that the butterfly keyboard is not long for this world
[03:23.520 --> 03:27.000]  Which I am like dancing on its grave already, even though it's not dead yet
[03:27.000 --> 03:28.440]  I as you know
[03:28.440 --> 03:34.640]  I couldn't possibly be more happy that the butterfly keyboard appears by all accounts to be going away pretty soon
[03:34.640 --> 03:38.320]  So if you think about like if they did keep around the old 15 inch
[03:38.840 --> 03:42.660]  What are they gonna do have that be like the only butterfly keyboard in the lineup for a while or like?
[03:42.960 --> 03:48.480]  Have you know if they if they hit the current air and maybe keep it around at a cheaper price point next year
[03:48.680 --> 03:55.120]  Really? Like when the alleged new scissor switch air comes out depending on who you believe either in September October or 2020
[03:57.680 --> 04:03.560]  Allegedly, you know, there's a new MacBook Air and new 13 inch and new 16 inch then if that's actually true
[04:03.560 --> 04:09.320]  Sometime in the next year then there will be no new models with butterfly keyboards
[04:09.320 --> 04:11.520]  Unless they keep around some of the current ones at lower prices
[04:11.520 --> 04:16.520]  and it would just it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense if they would do that like only for the 15 inch and
[04:16.840 --> 04:23.160]  Not for anything else like the air and it seems especially problematic that the 15 inches is a high-end computer
[04:23.160 --> 04:27.660]  That's bought in large quantities by businesses and by a lot of their pro market
[04:27.920 --> 04:32.760]  It would be weird to have to if they're gonna go through all this hassle to get rid of the butterfly keyboard because of its
[04:32.760 --> 04:38.680]  Problems, why would they keep it on such an important wide widely used model? It doesn't seem that doesn't make sense
[04:38.680 --> 04:42.600]  So I think the 16 inch is it and the pricing rumors?
[04:42.600 --> 04:48.080]  I don't give a lot of credibility to yeah, that's being said like it wouldn't be
[04:48.960 --> 04:55.560]  Totally out of the ordinary for Apple to release a new generation of an important product that cost significantly more than spread assessor
[04:55.960 --> 05:01.280]  It would be not well received but that doesn't mean they won't do it and that they they do it all the time
[05:01.280 --> 05:05.120]  so I think while I don't believe pricing rumors usually I
[05:05.680 --> 05:10.260]  also wouldn't rule out the possibility that this new laptop might be
[05:10.600 --> 05:17.340]  $3,000 and that might just be the new starting price of the you know, the 15 inch class laptop, which is now 16 inches
[05:17.680 --> 05:23.180]  That's totally plausible. Apple does that kind of stuff all the time and you know another angle I was thinking about was
[05:24.280 --> 05:27.960]  Apple does I mean maybe this doesn't matter because they I think they sell a
[05:27.960 --> 05:32.960]  absolute ton of the base model configurations relative to any customized configs but
[05:33.360 --> 05:38.000]  With the drop in flash storage pricing that's going on across the industry and they just drop their prices
[05:38.560 --> 05:45.840]  Apple might just be forced by market pressure to make less on their upgrade components that they as they used to
[05:46.120 --> 05:52.400]  Hmm, and so maybe they are gonna make up for that lost margin by just raising the base price on all the models
[05:52.400 --> 05:57.040]  I guess I can't really think of anything that would make the price jump up that much. I mean presumably Apple
[05:57.040 --> 06:02.120]  Well, right, but I can't you don't need a reason right? I think it's a marketing decision. Yeah, not in
[06:02.640 --> 06:10.560]  Cost of Goods decision. I mean presumably the display is going to be at least slightly more expensive because they're calling it a 16 inch
[06:10.560 --> 06:15.440]  Display, so it's gonna be bigger than the 15.6 inch display
[06:15.960 --> 06:17.960]  4 I think 15.4
[06:20.440 --> 06:24.880]  Maybe I don't even know I don't I don't know how many of the details of the screen came out
[06:24.880 --> 06:31.200]  But the other thing that would be nice and would justify to some degree the price increase would be if it goes to
[06:31.800 --> 06:33.280]  truly native
[06:33.280 --> 06:34.480]  retina
[06:34.480 --> 06:38.400]  Resolution. Yeah actual 2x of rights of what the default setting is, right?
[06:38.400 --> 06:43.280]  Which it has never which it has had when the default setting was lower up until 2016
[06:44.000 --> 06:49.360]  But yeah now like yeah cuz like right now they ship it by default in the scaling mode. All right, and I
[06:49.360 --> 06:56.840]  I mean it just feels off for the highest end laptop in the lineup. Yeah to be scaled like the the 15 inch
[06:57.680 --> 07:03.120]  Non-retina in going up until 2012 the non retina 15 inch the last couple of years of it
[07:03.120 --> 07:08.160]  They offered this high-res option and a matte option by the way for like $200 extras
[07:08.160 --> 07:16.320]  It was a small price increase and it was instead of being 1440 across it was 1680 across right and when the 2012 retina
[07:16.320 --> 07:23.920]  Version came out it went it was only the 1440 natively but you could use these software scaling modes to simulate higher resolutions
[07:23.920 --> 07:27.000]  So it was like, okay, that's nice like, you know, good job
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.480]  You know that you can you can get higher resolutions, but if you were accustomed to the 1680 point size
[07:31.920 --> 07:34.460]  You were actually getting worse visual quality because it was
[07:34.760 --> 07:38.960]  Rendering it into like an off-screen buffer like shrinking it down to fit the actual pixels of the screen
[07:38.960 --> 07:43.800]  So everything was like a little bit blurrier and it's not a massive difference
[07:43.800 --> 07:47.920]  but you you can tell it does look a little bit worse and then
[07:48.520 --> 07:53.640]  What you know what made it I think almost, you know, misleading and and I wouldn't say criminal
[07:53.640 --> 07:58.960]  but certainly offensive to a nerd like us who cares about like image quality is that starting from the
[07:59.240 --> 08:04.800]  2015 MacBook and then the 2016 USB C generation of laptops they increased the
[08:05.280 --> 08:11.520]  default resolution from what the panels actually were to one step above so they increased the
[08:11.520 --> 08:12.680]  the
[08:12.680 --> 08:17.720]  Apparent screen real estate to 1680 but at 2x now right on the 15
[08:17.720 --> 08:19.680]  But they didn't actually increase the number of pixels
[08:19.680 --> 08:24.280]  so I almost feel like they kind of cheated like they tried to make it look like the screens got better and they didn't and
[08:24.800 --> 08:31.840]  And what's disappointing is that so far the Ming Chi quo rumor about the 16-inch has its pixel size
[08:31.960 --> 08:37.320]  Pinned at something that would suggest they haven't actually increased that again. I couldn't remember if that was part of the rumor
[08:37.320 --> 08:42.240]  Yeah, it was like the current one is like 2880 and the new and I think is 3072 something like that
[08:42.240 --> 08:44.240]  So it's so it's like it's not enough
[08:44.760 --> 08:50.800]  Proportionately, I don't think to make it seem like they're actually doing like a true 2x of what the default setting is
[08:51.120 --> 08:55.800]  So it's not if that rumor is true, then it sounds like they haven't actually fixed this problem. But this is actually one thing I
[08:56.960 --> 09:00.240]  When I had a briefing with some Apple people
[09:00.920 --> 09:04.200]  Last year. I actually brought this up specifically as an issue
[09:04.200 --> 09:07.760]  I'm like you got to fix this for the next generation because like this it to me
[09:07.760 --> 09:10.280]  I understand making that kind of compromise on
[09:10.880 --> 09:13.920]  Something like a MacBook Air where it's it's a lower end product
[09:13.920 --> 09:18.240]  You're doing it to hit a price point the buyers might not care as much if the screen is a little bit blurrier than it
[09:18.240 --> 09:20.520]  Could be at its default setting fine. That makes sense
[09:20.560 --> 09:26.400]  But on the MacBook Pro where you care so much about this amazing screen and they talk and they put so much work into the
[09:26.400 --> 09:34.760]  amazing screen they have this amazing color and contrast and detail and the finishing and everything like any possibly higher refresh rates coming down the
[09:34.760 --> 09:39.920]  Road they have they put so much effort into the display and on their highest end laptop
[09:39.920 --> 09:45.640]  They can't make it actual to actual true 2x pixels like that. I don't any argument they have for that
[09:45.640 --> 09:46.440]  I don't think it's a good argument
[09:46.440 --> 09:46.840]  Yeah
[09:46.840 --> 09:48.960]  I don't think so, especially because they do it right on the desktops
[09:49.000 --> 09:52.720]  Right and they have since 2014 when the when the retina iMac came out, right?
[09:52.720 --> 09:58.480]  Well, it's even in the name. They even call it 5k. I mean, yeah, they couldn't call it the retina 5k iMac if
[09:59.560 --> 10:00.560]  5k
[10:00.560 --> 10:05.200]  Pixels exactly. Well, we know they can do it. And so I just I wish they would
[10:06.000 --> 10:11.720]  What else is that? We have news wise. How about these? How you doing with the betas this summer? Oh my god. I
[10:13.760 --> 10:15.760]  Listen to the 80 I listen to ATP
[10:15.760 --> 10:22.960]  I don't know if it was last week or the week before but you'd see you said more or less you're giving up on getting
[10:23.960 --> 10:25.960]  anything other than the
[10:27.480 --> 10:30.160]  iPhone update to overcast out by day one
[10:30.320 --> 10:30.800]  Yeah
[10:30.800 --> 10:38.520]  and and I'm actually I'm doing things like I spent the summer instead of doing like all iOS 13 and catalyst and
[10:39.040 --> 10:43.480]  An independent watch OS stuff instead of rewriting all my stuff in Swift UI and everything
[10:43.480 --> 10:47.240]  Which is like kind of what I thought I would be doing like the first day of WBC when we heard all this stuff
[10:47.240 --> 10:50.600]  I'm like great. This is gonna be a packed summer. I'm gonna be doing all this stuff all the new betas
[10:51.080 --> 10:55.720]  Yeah, then I got the betas and it turns out they're really still pretty rough still pretty early
[10:55.920 --> 11:00.240]  I I don't even want to touch catalyst or Catalina anymore
[11:00.240 --> 11:04.120]  like I did the first two betas of that and like I knew nope, I'm done with that for a little while and
[11:04.800 --> 11:09.120]  And even like even the API stuff iOS 13 is still super rough
[11:09.120 --> 11:12.360]  It's hard to tell like when I when I make something with the UI of it
[11:12.360 --> 11:17.800]  It's hard to tell whether any bugs are my fault or the OSS fault and and so I've just decided you know what?
[11:17.800 --> 11:19.360]  I'm just gonna focus on
[11:19.360 --> 11:25.040]  Underlying like under the hood changes this summer that are preparing the way for me to do more of that stuff in like a month
[11:25.040 --> 11:29.120]  Or two and so like like for instance like last week. I spent most of the past week
[11:30.320 --> 11:32.320]  writing the sync engine differently
[11:32.520 --> 11:39.680]  Because the sync engine the way it's been doing it from like 1.0 until now has some limitations and more importantly it has some really
[11:39.680 --> 11:42.680]  incredibly intense memory usage
[11:43.320 --> 11:49.880]  When you're doing a full resync to the servers when you have a lot of a lot of podcasts and at first I thought well
[11:49.880 --> 11:54.760]  Who's gonna have more than like, you know, 20 30 podcast subscribed and I looked at my own account
[11:54.760 --> 11:59.800]  I already and I have 90 and I'm like, alright, maybe maybe this is a more common than I think and I look
[11:59.800 --> 12:01.440]  You know a lot of you just have like
[12:01.440 --> 12:02.520]  200 300
[12:02.520 --> 12:07.400]  I think the the peak is something like 600 to a thousand Wow and and that that is it isn't like
[12:07.400 --> 12:13.520]  You know one person who has that it's like multiple, you know, it's not that uncommon to have a couple hundred podcast subscriptions and overcast
[12:13.520 --> 12:15.680]  especially after you've using it for like five years, so
[12:16.800 --> 12:21.560]  The problem is that kind of sync engine won't fit in the Apple watches constraints
[12:21.560 --> 12:24.760]  So when I want to make an independent watch app, which I do want to do
[12:24.760 --> 12:27.640]  I can't bring the sync engine over until I change it
[12:27.640 --> 12:32.020]  So now I've spent the last week like doing sync in a pretty different way
[12:32.320 --> 12:35.920]  That should be much better and changing the server to support it and everything else
[12:35.920 --> 12:40.720]  so that's the kind of work I'm doing now because I don't need to be using the beta SDK to do pretty much any of
[12:40.720 --> 12:41.680]  that and
[12:41.680 --> 12:47.920]  once this fall comes around I can actually like install the GM versions of these tools and
[12:48.240 --> 12:51.640]  Hope they're at all ready to go and hope for the love of God
[12:51.640 --> 12:57.120]  Whoever's writing the iOS mail app has gotten their act together. Oh god mail is so bad. Have you using are you me on betas?
[12:57.680 --> 12:59.480]  I
[12:59.480 --> 13:01.480]  Have it on my old iPhone 10
[13:01.480 --> 13:09.160]  And I have it on an iPad mini and it was I got so freaked that
[13:10.120 --> 13:14.960]  Because I saw stories from people who were saying that I won't even running it on my main device
[13:15.320 --> 13:18.840]  But it's screwed up my iCloud or my notes or something
[13:18.840 --> 13:24.360]  Yeah, that's the scariest and so I and I just don't feel it doesn't it's not useful for me to try it with a throwaway
[13:24.700 --> 13:26.400]  iCloud account
[13:26.400 --> 13:32.520]  Like if I'm not actually using my actual data, what's the point? So right. I'm not really doing it. What's wrong with mail on iOS?
[13:33.520 --> 13:39.740]  my understanding is that they rewrote so iOS 13 brought a lot of a lot of new changes to
[13:39.980 --> 13:43.280]  some of the basic UI components that a lot of iOS apps use namely
[13:43.700 --> 13:45.700]  table views and collection views and
[13:45.800 --> 13:51.960]  Like how they manage their data how like when a new item comes in you can animate it in instead of just like refreshing the whole
[13:51.960 --> 13:57.880]  table as like, you know a single frame and they made that easier and it changed the API's around that and and they added introduced a
[13:57.880 --> 14:03.540]  Bunch of new stuff to just make all that stuff better and easier to use and so my understanding is they rewrote mail
[14:04.320 --> 14:06.320]  entirely using collection view and
[14:06.760 --> 14:09.800]  using these some of these new data source methods and
[14:10.560 --> 14:12.480]  It's really early
[14:12.480 --> 14:18.420]  I would say to try to be kind to people writing it like if you use the mail app on the phone
[14:18.420 --> 14:23.520]  I would not recommend installing the iOS 13 betas because there's just all sorts of like bugs that
[14:23.940 --> 14:26.560]  You might have if it was like your very first
[14:27.080 --> 14:30.680]  It's not like the kind of rewrote a lot of that UI from scratch and it shows
[14:31.160 --> 14:33.880]  Because you'll have bugs like like in table views
[14:33.880 --> 14:37.560]  You'll have cell reuse bugs where like as you're scrolling
[14:37.960 --> 14:43.600]  The title of one message will be repeated on all on all the cells in the screen or like they'll all say no sender
[14:43.600 --> 14:48.640]  And instead of the actual sender of the mail or you'll have rows that are inserted that are empty
[14:49.760 --> 14:55.640]  Problems like that. So it's yeah, if you use iOS mail don't install the betas yet. I think it's gonna be interesting because
[14:57.040 --> 14:59.040]  It sounds to me like
[15:02.580 --> 15:04.580]  Apple's behind
[15:04.580 --> 15:12.740]  For where they really should be to ship the iPhone a new iPhone in early September. I mean, we're like five weeks out, but
[15:14.620 --> 15:16.620]  I don't know that they would
[15:18.020 --> 15:19.460]  Hold
[15:19.460 --> 15:25.500]  The iPhone hardware up for an extra two or three weeks of bug polished and finished just to do it
[15:25.500 --> 15:27.940]  Like I wouldn't be surprised if they announced the phone on
[15:28.900 --> 15:33.740]  Schedule, but maybe it doesn't ship until the end of September. They still have the early September event
[15:33.740 --> 15:39.460]  But you know if it's buggy if iOS is buggy that is when reviewers get the phones, right?
[15:39.460 --> 15:41.460]  Yeah, we get them right after the event
[15:42.100 --> 15:44.200]  It just seems like it is
[15:45.780 --> 15:47.420]  You know
[15:47.420 --> 15:51.340]  They're playing with fire this year because that that hardware date is sort of set in stone
[15:51.980 --> 15:56.960]  And I don't even I don't think they would even delay the shipping of the phones for software because you know
[15:56.960 --> 15:58.040]  A lot of their products, you know
[15:58.040 --> 16:03.420]  The volumes that they might sell in additional two weeks in a quarter might not matter so much to their financials
[16:03.420 --> 16:07.420]  But the phone matters a lot like if they miss two weeks of sales because the software is a little bit rough
[16:07.580 --> 16:10.780]  That's gonna hurt them in the financials in ways that are probably not worth it
[16:10.780 --> 16:13.340]  I'm guessing they ship the phone on the same day
[16:13.340 --> 16:18.920]  They were planned to no matter what right and they just make the software as good as they could make it by that day
[16:18.920 --> 16:24.300]  And just hope for the best. Yeah, you know, maybe they're gonna delay the you know Mac OS and
[16:24.940 --> 16:29.300]  WatchOS or TV OS and whatever the heck the HomePod OS is called
[16:29.300 --> 16:35.060]  Like maybe they delay those things a little bit to in order to prioritize iOS getting out the door on that hardware ship date
[16:35.140 --> 16:43.140]  Well, they but they've been doing the new watch hardware at the iPhone event. That's true. And I presume, you know
[16:43.660 --> 16:45.260]  I mean
[16:45.260 --> 16:51.000]  There's so many you'd always so many fewer watch rumors than iPhone rumors, but I presume we'll see
[16:51.780 --> 16:57.820]  Series 5 watches this fall. I mean maybe you know, the watch hasn't been an exactly annual cycle though
[16:57.820 --> 17:02.220]  Hmm, like there's been a couple of little 18-month spans here and there and in between a couple of generations
[17:02.220 --> 17:08.580]  So I think it's most likely we'll see a series 5 but I wouldn't say it's as it isn't as sure of a thing as
[17:08.860 --> 17:14.300]  iPhones every September. Mm-hmm, but I do think it's most likely and and I think again, they're basically gonna like, you know
[17:14.300 --> 17:17.740]  Take the the prey approach to software quality
[17:19.180 --> 17:26.340]  Just try to make the deadline as hard as you can because it's going to come regardless because it's too important with the phone
[17:26.340 --> 17:31.260]  I think they would they literally would not even sell the phone or they wouldn't they wouldn't delay selling the phone for hardware
[17:31.260 --> 17:36.940]  I think with the watch they might like they might announce it that same day and oh, it doesn't ship for three weeks
[17:36.940 --> 17:39.620]  Yeah, we're shipping in October or something. Yeah, right
[17:41.420 --> 17:43.780]  Let me take a break thank our first sponsor
[17:44.380 --> 17:47.820]  You like this that we're having me do the sponsor reads. Oh my god. It's luxurious
[17:47.900 --> 17:51.900]  You don't do them live on the show though. You you you edit those things in yeah
[17:51.900 --> 17:55.820]  I record the sponsor reads right before the show like a half hour before basically like I like
[17:55.820 --> 17:57.820]  Whenever the live stream starts on ATP
[17:57.820 --> 18:02.260]  I just finished doing the sponsor reads basically I do I do it all in a row do the sponsor reads
[18:02.420 --> 18:05.620]  Do the live stream and then this I start the live stream and I go like, you know
[18:05.620 --> 18:07.700]  refill my water cup and you know
[18:07.700 --> 18:09.880]  Make sure I'm like, you know put my kid to bed and I mean, you know
[18:09.880 --> 18:13.060]  Whatever else I might have to do in the meantime, but it's usually about a half hour before. All right
[18:13.060 --> 18:15.020]  Well, let me tell you about fracture
[18:15.020 --> 18:21.220]  Fracture is the company takes your photos prints them directly on glass in vivid color in vivid color
[18:21.220 --> 18:28.180]  Look, I this is that my message for fracture is always the same your phone is probably full of thousands and thousands of photos

[18:35.700 --> 18:41.900]  You're probably on big, you know, a lot of a lot of people who don't work at Apple are probably taking vacations in August
[18:43.100 --> 18:50.100]  Apple people we're sorry pick some of your favorite photos get them printed by the folks at fracture hang them up around your house

[19:10.060 --> 19:14.820]  They make them right down in Gainesville, Florida from u.s. Sourced materials
[19:14.820 --> 19:20.840]  It's a green company carbon neutral factory. You can go to fracture me
[19:21.360 --> 19:26.060]  Fractured dot me for a special discount on your first fracture order
[19:26.780 --> 19:31.880]  Don't forget at the end of the at the end of your order. They could give you a one question survey
[19:32.420 --> 19:36.540]  Where did you hear about fracture? Just remember to tell them it was the talk show or if you prefer
[19:37.260 --> 19:38.460]  ATP
[19:38.460 --> 19:42.680]  Thank you very much. So my thanks to fracture go check them out of fracture dot me
[19:42.680 --> 19:46.120]  Yeah, they're pretty great houses full of them. They're fantastic. Yeah, I can verify that
[19:48.480 --> 19:51.480]  Got a lot of cereal downstairs I opened my big mouth
[19:52.800 --> 19:58.440]  Talking about ATP, but you guys were talking about grape nuts. Of course Johnson accused of loves grape nuts. So do I they're good
[19:58.800 --> 20:00.800]  It's crunchy bread gravel. I
[20:01.560 --> 20:07.920]  I think grape nuts look like they're delicious. I kind of like like a cinnamony sort of crunchy cereal
[20:08.160 --> 20:11.840]  They look very different. I first time I ever tried grape nuts
[20:11.840 --> 20:15.720]  It was the most surprising taste. I just did not expect it
[20:17.080 --> 20:22.600]  They really just tastes like you're eating sand or kitty litter or something. I feel like in the in the area of
[20:23.440 --> 20:29.080]  Not that sugary cereals, you know, cuz all all breakfast cereal like that. It has a good degree of sugar and carbs and everything
[20:29.080 --> 20:32.800]  It's really not the greatest thing you could be eating but but in the area of cereals
[20:32.800 --> 20:37.200]  There's like there's like the sugary ones like the super sugary ones like, you know, your frosted flakes
[20:37.200 --> 20:39.200]  You're you know, captain kronix that kind of stuff
[20:39.200 --> 20:45.240]  And then there's the ones that have less sugar like Cheerios and grape nuts
[20:45.640 --> 20:52.320]  And I think in the less sugar category grape nuts are they do surprisingly well because usually in that category
[20:53.040 --> 20:58.200]  You just have some kind of like, you know weird like, you know wheat brand thing
[20:58.720 --> 21:03.400]  Compressed into some kind of flake or blob or shape or something and it's it's just really boring
[21:03.400 --> 21:08.400]  Usually grape nuts have a have a really fun texture. Like you really got to work hard
[21:08.400 --> 21:15.240]  You really feel like I'm gonna I'm earning these calories that I'm eating here by like chomping on this gravel in my mouth
[21:15.240 --> 21:18.060]  It's taking forever to chew and and it provides a lot more
[21:18.600 --> 21:24.840]  Texture and and I think more flavor than the other not that sugary cereals like Cheerios basically tastes like nothing
[21:24.840 --> 21:30.280]  Yeah, you know Cheerios are baby food basically. Yeah, and they're quite commonly used for that purpose
[21:30.280 --> 21:33.360]  That's exactly I still associated my son's 15 now
[21:33.360 --> 21:38.560]  But I still associate Cheerios very strongly with when he was learning to eat solid food
[21:38.600 --> 21:45.960]  Oh, yeah, you know and it occupies the kids to perfect kid food because it's not messy. I mean, there's you know powder it does
[21:46.480 --> 21:51.720]  change the smell of a car forever if you if you let your kids eat Cheerios in the car like the
[21:51.960 --> 21:57.080]  The smell like you know how like when you when you walk into somebody's house and they have a cat you can always smell like
[21:57.080 --> 21:58.280]  Oh, there's a cat lives here
[21:58.280 --> 22:01.440]  Even if they're pretty clean people you can always kind of tell oh there's you smell a little bit
[22:01.440 --> 22:05.960]  Okay, I was here right you can always tell if people have kids when you get into their car because it'll smell a little bit
[22:05.960 --> 22:07.240]  like Cheerios
[22:07.240 --> 22:09.440]  Because it's like it's like sand at the beach
[22:09.440 --> 22:12.560]  You can't you can't really get all the Cheerios out of the backseat, right? Exactly
[22:12.560 --> 22:15.720]  It'll always smell a little bit like that and it's you know with the kids, too
[22:15.720 --> 22:21.400]  It's always when they're at that Cheerios age. They're also car seat age and that just makes
[22:22.600 --> 22:28.580]  Way more crevices. Yeah where a straight Cheerio can get and you wouldn't even notice, you know
[22:28.580 --> 22:34.240]  You take get the kid out of the car give an eyeball to the backseat and kind of clean up anything you need to clean
[22:34.240 --> 22:36.240]  Up, but those Cheerios they'll get into every crack in the car
[22:36.240 --> 22:36.480]  Oh, yeah
[22:36.480 --> 22:37.400]  Meanwhile then like, you know
[22:37.400 --> 22:42.160]  The car is being baked in the Sun for the next three years and those Cheerios are just roasting in that car seat crevice that
[22:42.160 --> 22:45.920]  You can't reach that smell does not go away. I'm always interested cuz
[22:47.000 --> 22:53.680]  You know, we're of similar age John Syracuse and I are very close in age very similar backgrounds. We even share a first name
[22:54.760 --> 22:56.760]  And it always is fascinating to me
[22:56.760 --> 22:58.600]  where
[22:58.600 --> 23:02.080]  How much aligned our interests are our perspectives?
[23:02.120 --> 23:07.640]  but then there's other areas where we are totally different and so I thought I was interesting like
[23:08.920 --> 23:13.840]  He was saying that when he grew up, he wasn't allowed to have sugar cereal as we called it. Yeah
[23:14.840 --> 23:18.320]  In my house, I was telling you this last night. It was
[23:19.920 --> 23:23.500]  We weren't big junk food people but my family
[23:23.500 --> 23:27.020]  really bought in completely to the
[23:28.020 --> 23:30.740]  mid mid century post World War two
[23:31.740 --> 23:33.140]  Kellogg's
[23:33.140 --> 23:35.140]  Start your day with a bowl of breakfast
[23:35.300 --> 23:37.300]  So we had like a veritable
[23:37.700 --> 23:39.420]  selection of
[23:39.420 --> 23:46.180]  Cereals we always had Cheerios. My dad was a big Cheerios guy. So we'd have some Cheerios. We'd have the cornflakes was a big one and
[23:46.180 --> 23:52.820]  And then my sister and I could pick out two or three sugar cereals at a time and we'd have them open so I could
[23:52.820 --> 24:00.380]  Have fruit loops one day. I could have frosted flakes another day, but every single day of the week was a sugar cereal day for us
[24:00.900 --> 24:01.940]  That's interesting. Yes
[24:01.940 --> 24:07.020]  See we were we were restricted to only weekends would be like we'd have like crackling oat bran on the weekdays
[24:07.020 --> 24:14.540]  And then the weekends would that was the splurge that way then that's when we could have such crazy innovations as like when I was
[24:14.540 --> 24:17.900]  a kid, that's when the Rice Krispies Treats cereal debuted
[24:18.620 --> 24:20.220]  Remember did not need to exist
[24:20.220 --> 24:20.500]  No
[24:20.500 --> 24:25.700]  And I remember like when we got it thinking like this is gonna be illegal in like a year like there's no this should this should
[24:25.700 --> 24:31.540]  Be illegal already. There's no way this is gonna keep being on the market. And here we are still I used to it would be
[24:31.540 --> 24:35.820]  Something I would look forward to I can't say I went to the grocery store all the time with my mom
[24:35.820 --> 24:38.980]  but you know, maybe like eight nine ten, you you you know, I might have been I
[24:40.360 --> 24:43.780]  Forget when I was allowed to stay home by myself if my mom went to the grocery store
[24:43.780 --> 24:48.460]  But one of the things I like to do at the grocery store would be to pick cereal and in hindsight
[24:49.020 --> 24:53.780]  it's kind of crazy that there's an entire aisle in a giant supermarket filled with nothing but
[24:54.420 --> 24:57.220]  Junk food, that's no accident. That's passed off as a
[24:57.860 --> 25:01.580]  Meal and there's so much about that too. Like like the shape of the boxes is
[25:02.180 --> 25:04.420]  Actually a huge waste of cardboard like oh, right
[25:04.420 --> 25:10.420]  It's like the the most effective way to pack that kind of cereal would be in a much more like short squat box
[25:10.420 --> 25:14.380]  Almost like the shape of like a pop-tarts box like like a shorter squatter box that's deeper
[25:14.380 --> 25:21.340]  But they make them these giant skinny flat rectangles. So they appear large on the shelf. They're like billboards for kids
[25:21.340 --> 25:22.360]  Yeah, and of course
[25:22.360 --> 25:27.360]  They're all you know that all the sugariest ones are at kid height so that kids can see it and beg their parents to buy
[25:27.360 --> 25:30.200]  It well, I got Whole Foods. They'll sell cereal that comes in a bag
[25:30.500 --> 25:32.140]  They do have box cereal too
[25:32.140 --> 25:37.360]  But but they'll sell that cereal in a bag and then I think they even like label it on the bag like this is space
[25:37.360 --> 25:41.200]  Efficient. Yeah, right. You're you're trying to tell you like look like we were growing up
[25:41.200 --> 25:44.820]  There were bag cereals at the very bottom and they were like the cheapo one, right?
[25:44.820 --> 25:49.020]  Right, so they're trying to like probably try to get rid of that image of like no trust me if bag cereal is good
[25:49.020 --> 25:50.960]  I don't say I think it's a losing battle
[25:50.960 --> 25:55.280]  I think I think that that ship has sailed and no one's ever gonna think that but but they can try
[25:55.560 --> 26:00.020]  One thing too. I realize like when I was a kid just like how
[26:00.800 --> 26:02.400]  incredibly effective
[26:02.400 --> 26:07.520]  TV commercials during kids shows were at getting kids to make their parents buy them certain things
[26:07.720 --> 26:13.240]  because like now like my kid now we you know, we I've been a cord cutter since before it was called that and
[26:13.840 --> 26:16.940]  My kid now has almost never seen TV commercials
[26:16.940 --> 26:20.400]  like well if we were if we're like in a hotel room will turn the TV on and he'll
[26:20.560 --> 26:22.980]  Feel like why does the show keep stopping and what is this?
[26:23.800 --> 26:28.560]  Like but so for the most part he doesn't see commercials. So it's interesting that he almost never
[26:28.560 --> 26:36.680]  Requests certain exact things like buy certain brands or certain toys the way we would and I just remember thinking like, you know
[26:36.680 --> 26:41.240]  the reason I knew about Rice Krispies Treat cereal when I was a kid was that I watched Saturday morning cartoons and
[26:41.400 --> 26:44.200]  And probably TV throughout the week at different times as well
[26:44.200 --> 26:44.560]  and
[26:44.560 --> 26:49.320]  So I always I saw all the commercials and I would beg for the things in them that were usually not as good as I
[26:49.320 --> 26:52.080]  Thought they would be like the typhoon hovercraft piece of crap
[26:53.760 --> 26:57.600]  And and and like, you know, but now so I
[26:57.600 --> 27:00.740]  Know I wouldn't say like so few kids watch commercials
[27:00.740 --> 27:05.720]  but certainly a lot fewer now watch commercials than did like in the 80s and 90s and
[27:06.120 --> 27:08.120]  Wonder like how does that change like?
[27:08.800 --> 27:14.160]  How do our kids even know like what to ask for? I mean YouTube I guess I
[27:14.760 --> 27:23.360]  it in hindsight, I can definitely agree that I was more influenced by by kids show commercials than I would have as a
[27:25.080 --> 27:27.080]  Smart alecky
[27:27.080 --> 27:33.760]  Kid who was you know fairly cynical from a young age? I would have sworn up and down that you know
[27:33.760 --> 27:41.240]  It's that's for dummies who get brainwashed by commercials. I'm smart. And meanwhile, I'm asking my mom for mr. T cereal, right?
[27:41.720 --> 27:47.240]  And we don't like we don't even go like, you know, there were the two areas to avenues of marketing that hit us hard
[27:47.240 --> 27:47.680]  You know
[27:47.680 --> 27:52.000]  There's a commercials with a big one and then also like we would be going to a lot more
[27:52.000 --> 27:57.240]  Retail stores like we would go to a toy store to buy certain toys now we just get them on Amazon
[27:57.240 --> 28:01.400]  Yeah, and so like we don't like my kid is hardly ever in a toy store
[28:01.400 --> 28:06.600]  I don't even know if any toys are still in business, right? Everything just comes in a brown Amazon box, right?
[28:06.600 --> 28:12.600]  So like the only the only method of marketing that seems to work on him is when his friends at school have something then he'll
[28:12.600 --> 28:14.400]  Often ask for one, you know one like that
[28:14.400 --> 28:19.360]  But that's about it and and a lot of his friends at school are have similar parents who were like hearing also are pretty much
[28:19.360 --> 28:24.720]  Cord cutters and Amazon shoppers. So like the the amount of like things that he asks for
[28:25.320 --> 28:30.840]  Specifically, you know certain brand names or certain types of food are very very low compared to what we did when we were kids
[28:30.880 --> 28:32.880]  Yeah, definitely. I
[28:34.560 --> 28:39.320]  I think it's also the cereal racket before we move on to other topics the cereal rack
[28:39.320 --> 28:40.360]  This is better than tech news
[28:40.360 --> 28:45.720]  I mean the cereal racket was always interesting to me because it it was a very vibrant
[28:45.720 --> 28:49.280]  It probably still is I'm guessing it's a very vibrant
[28:49.960 --> 28:51.960]  distinctive mix between
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.440]  all-time classics that haven't changed ever
[28:56.480 --> 28:59.960]  Cheerios corn flakes. Yeah, I think rape nuts are not certain
[28:59.960 --> 29:03.520]  Yeah, like there was the article I mentioned ATP the no grapes no nuts. No market share
[29:03.520 --> 29:08.200]  I think it was called like it said how like they change they had to change the recipe twice like once to add
[29:08.920 --> 29:12.400]  They added back a little bit of the like the like wheat hulls
[29:12.400 --> 29:17.680]  They could call it whole grain and at some at one time they add they like fortify it with vitamins to get the vitamin
[29:17.720 --> 29:22.400]  Comply with something. Yeah, like so like most of these things like corn flakes like there
[29:22.400 --> 29:26.680]  I think they have similar things like they've even modified very slightly over time, but they're basically the same thing
[29:26.680 --> 29:32.500]  But you've got these staples you got these classics and then there's the the like I said, mr. Tea cereal
[29:32.500 --> 29:38.060]  I mean, I'm dating myself here, but I remember pac-man cereal was a big deal in the early 80s
[29:38.060 --> 29:44.180]  You know, they would just take whatever the fad of you know, 1982 and then they would make a breakfast cereal out of it
[29:44.180 --> 29:49.340]  Of course, why wouldn't you I seem to recall? I think Nintendo had a cereal at one point. Oh, yeah every big
[29:49.340 --> 29:51.500]  Yeah, I'm sure they were like Mario cereals and stuff
[29:51.500 --> 29:55.460]  They were I'm sure there was probably a sonic cereal when I was you know going through that time
[29:56.020 --> 30:01.260]  Because they you know, they were always cereal companies are shameless with licensing and everything. You can get pretty much anything
[30:01.300 --> 30:04.860]  Yeah, they should do like an iPhone cereal. Just see you're eating like little tiny iPhones
[30:04.860 --> 30:10.280]  I wonder could they get the super ellipse shape of the icons? Yeah, can they get that right? No
[30:10.780 --> 30:14.680]  They don't even make pac-man right? Yeah, did not look like pac-man. Yeah
[30:14.680 --> 30:18.820]  See, it seems like the breakfast cereal factory tooling is not incredibly precise
[30:20.220 --> 30:26.700]  I know it's I always enjoyed to that small print on the cereal boxes like like as they you know
[30:27.540 --> 30:30.120]  Would people sue I don't know but it's like, you know
[30:30.120 --> 30:35.900]  They'd show you having your your bowl of Cheerios and then there's a bunch of cut up strawberries in it and then they tell you
[30:35.900 --> 30:38.340]  That the strawberries are not included and it's like oh, yeah
[30:38.340 --> 30:43.080]  All right, pretty sure fresh strawberries are not gonna do well in this box. But yeah strawberries shown for scale
[30:43.260 --> 30:47.220]  Yeah, like or like the the part of this complete breakfast nonsense. Oh, right. So it's fun
[30:47.220 --> 30:51.300]  Like I forget the story there. There's some story behind that of basically like, you know
[30:51.300 --> 30:56.100]  it's there was some reason why the wireless cereal companies would advertise as part of this complete breakfast and it was
[30:56.100 --> 31:02.460]  it again, like as with many food claims it's total BS and it's like the the better breakfast would be that exact same thing minus the
[31:02.460 --> 31:04.460]  Cereal and that would actually be a better
[31:05.100 --> 31:07.340]  Than whatever you're adding the cereal to right now
[31:08.620 --> 31:14.540]  I also think I think it's complete nonsense that I know that did people debate about this and I think different
[31:14.780 --> 31:17.280]  This is it's very personal in my opinion
[31:17.300 --> 31:23.820]  You're with the way your body metabolizes whether you're a morning person or a night late night person, but they really successfully
[31:23.820 --> 31:31.100]  sold all of North America on the idea that breakfast is the quote most important meal of the day like if
[31:31.580 --> 31:37.020]  Yeah, I feel like whatever whatever meal your food goes in that you sell you want to make that claim, right?
[31:37.020 --> 31:43.220]  Oh, I just think you know, but that's a bold claim and they had like nothing to back it up
[31:43.220 --> 31:45.220]  They're just like well, we'll just tell people that yeah
[31:45.220 --> 31:49.820]  Yeah, I think what we found is like because now we have you know a variety of like now
[31:49.820 --> 31:54.300]  You know, I know people who eat all sorts of breakfast from like large breakfasts to you know
[31:54.300 --> 31:58.660]  Super are healthy to super unhealthy to no breakfast and they all seem fine
[31:58.660 --> 32:02.620]  it seems like it might be the least important meal of the day actually like it seems like you can do pretty much whatever you
[32:02.620 --> 32:04.420]  want for breakfast and
[32:04.420 --> 32:06.760]  It's not gonna have a massive effect on you
[32:10.820 --> 32:12.380]  What else do we have
[32:12.380 --> 32:15.000]  What do you what's on your mind? I don't know
[32:15.000 --> 32:18.180]  I mean there's been a bunch of you know minor stuff like there was like the the whole like
[32:18.180 --> 32:21.060]  You know listening to Siri requests thing. I don't know how much there is there
[32:21.060 --> 32:23.580]  I don't really I don't care that strongly about that. Honestly, I so I
[32:25.420 --> 32:29.340]  That broke right before Molten I recorded over the weekend I
[32:30.780 --> 32:32.780]  Looked into it
[32:32.820 --> 32:34.820]  The Guardian is usually pretty good
[32:34.820 --> 32:41.840]  but I I don't get this like you definitely I knew we've always had to agree to some kind of terms with
[32:41.980 --> 32:43.980]  Siri that would acknowledge that they're
[32:45.740 --> 32:47.180]  Letting you
[32:47.180 --> 32:49.180]  like for quality control purposes
[32:49.580 --> 32:53.960]  listening, but that they're doing it in a completely anonymized fashion like I
[32:54.540 --> 32:57.020]  It just did not seem like new news to me. I
[32:57.820 --> 33:01.100]  Think the difference is and they talked about this this week on upgrade
[33:01.920 --> 33:03.920]  the difference is that
[33:04.140 --> 33:09.580]  When when you agree that like oh when you push the Siri button on your phone and you ask to do something it is going
[33:09.580 --> 33:13.460]  To servers and those servers are also gonna have things like your contact information
[33:13.460 --> 33:17.620]  So it can know like if you say, you know call TIFF it's gonna look at my contact to see who TIFF is
[33:18.060 --> 33:21.060]  And it does all that logic server side to the servers need your contacts stuff like that
[33:21.060 --> 33:25.540]  So we I think we who were in the know we we knew that and we knew that was doing that
[33:26.140 --> 33:28.480]  The main trick this is this is what upgrade brought up
[33:28.480 --> 33:34.440]  I think the main difference is that there's a lot of accidental invocations ever since the hey dingus support came out
[33:34.580 --> 33:37.020]  like like we have a home pod in our kitchen and
[33:37.740 --> 33:42.460]  All the time we'll be having a conversation that does not include those two words at all
[33:42.460 --> 33:48.460]  And you know home pod will pipe up in the corner. Hmm. Sorry. What was that or you know something like that?
[33:48.460 --> 33:52.620]  it'll make some noise that indicates that it was listening for a few seconds and thought we were trying to tell it something and then
[33:52.620 --> 33:54.620]  it failed for whatever reason and
[33:54.820 --> 34:00.140]  There that happens a lot and and the home pod is the only device that I have Hayden it isn't enabled for I don't even
[34:00.140 --> 34:03.780]  Use it on the other devices because honestly it's a lot easier to have a home pod in your house
[34:03.780 --> 34:06.200]  If that's the only device you have respond to that command
[34:06.200 --> 34:13.600]  It solves a number of problems. But anyway by default that features on on on most Apple devices these days
[34:13.600 --> 34:16.840]  Like it'll tell you during the setup wizard and it'll give you a chance to turn it off
[34:16.840 --> 34:18.040]  but like they the
[34:18.040 --> 34:21.560]  Like kind of like the default run through process the encouraged flow is to turn it on
[34:21.800 --> 34:29.920]  so a lot of people have the hey dingus support turned on and so that because it is both trying to be automatic with its
[34:30.000 --> 34:33.400]  invocation and because it is honestly not as good as
[34:33.400 --> 34:37.200]  Something like an Amazon echo at knowing when you're calling it and when you're not
[34:37.640 --> 34:42.200]  I think that's giving a lot of accidental input into Siri
[34:42.200 --> 34:47.080]  And so the controversial part of these recordings is like you didn't even realize it was recording
[34:47.080 --> 34:48.720]  And so who knows what you were talking about, right?
[34:48.720 --> 34:53.240]  and so you could have been doing something embarrassing or nefarious or private and
[34:53.760 --> 34:59.120]  And now like now somebody some somebody at some contractor in Silicon Valley not even an Apple employee
[34:59.120 --> 35:06.360]  but some contractors reviewing, you know, your sex tape or drug deal or whatever and it's like and that's just that goes against
[35:06.640 --> 35:10.760]  What people expect to be the case even though we know academically
[35:10.760 --> 35:11.040]  Oh, yeah
[35:11.040 --> 35:16.160]  Recordings go to the server like you think of it when you think of these things you think of the typical or ideal case
[35:16.160 --> 35:19.400]  You think oh when I push the button and and tell it ask it a question
[35:19.400 --> 35:22.380]  It's gonna send what I said to a server. Okay, no problem
[35:22.380 --> 35:25.500]  You don't think about all this accidental implications where it's recording just a random
[35:25.500 --> 35:29.680]  Snippet of audio from your world and then some weirdos listening to it
[35:30.600 --> 35:36.680]  and I would guess that accidental invocations might be more likely to be reviewed because
[35:37.320 --> 35:40.720]  Siri, you know, I do say she'll go. Hmm. I didn't catch that or right
[35:40.720 --> 35:48.600]  Yeah, and that maybe those get flagged as hey the last 15 seconds of interaction here weren't completed successfully
[35:48.840 --> 35:54.680]  and maybe that sets a flag that makes it more likely to be reviewed and I did see that that was in the Guardian story where
[35:54.680 --> 35:57.220]  That the anonymous contractor who is their source
[35:58.280 --> 36:01.040]  You know said that they heard drug deals and all
[36:02.800 --> 36:04.320]  I'm sure there's in the common case
[36:04.320 --> 36:08.360]  I'm sure most of what they hear is boring or nothing or or you know, just some random chatter
[36:08.360 --> 36:12.920]  but but yeah, like the fact is that can happen and it does occasionally at least happen and
[36:13.400 --> 36:16.660]  and I think the the main issue here is that
[36:17.260 --> 36:20.300]  People don't really know that that's happening
[36:20.300 --> 36:27.040]  like you can tell them in some small print somewhere, but they don't really know like they they don't you're not really going to
[36:27.960 --> 36:33.800]  Communicate well to people that your recordings of random audio snippets will be reviewed by humans sometimes
[36:34.880 --> 36:39.520]  like that there should be an explicit opt-out that says basically like can
[36:39.840 --> 36:45.800]  Can Apple review your recordings periodically, you know to for you know to improve quality or whatever, you know
[36:45.800 --> 36:50.840]  How are they word it but like that should be an explicit opt-out and right now there is no separate setting for that
[36:50.840 --> 36:56.800]  If you don't want Apple to review your recordings periodically, you can't use Siri right and you can't you can't both
[36:57.320 --> 36:59.320]  advance the position that
[36:59.480 --> 37:03.200]  Siri is the future and super important and we're tying so much functionality to Siri and
[37:03.760 --> 37:08.740]  Also say well if you don't like this detail of it, just don't use any of it. Like that's
[37:09.520 --> 37:14.560]  That's not a valid argument. I think at this point. I do think Siri is getting better
[37:14.560 --> 37:19.040]  I think it is, you know, I've always been a little like desktop Linux. I
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.480]  I remain optimistic about
[37:23.040 --> 37:24.920]  Siri's future
[37:24.920 --> 37:30.320]  but I still think that we are in such ridiculous early days of this and
[37:31.120 --> 37:33.640]  in some ways that frustrates me because it was like
[37:34.660 --> 37:37.600]  we went when I was a kid we went from like
[37:38.720 --> 37:43.160]  Steve the two Steve's making the Apple one in a garage
[37:43.160 --> 37:44.800]  to
[37:44.800 --> 37:49.280]  having the Macintosh seven years later like yeah
[37:49.840 --> 37:54.180]  It was really really rapid and all of a sudden by 1984
[37:54.180 --> 37:59.600]  We had these computers that had this really polished interface that was you know
[37:59.600 --> 38:02.380]  Like regular people could use it and understand it
[38:03.560 --> 38:06.820]  Whereas series have been around since 2011
[38:07.920 --> 38:09.240]  Yeah
[38:09.240 --> 38:15.360]  And it's not progressing as fast and none of them are that good but I did one of the little things I noticed and it's
[38:15.360 --> 38:21.280]  So hard, it's it's so much harder to evaluate than software on your phone or on your Mac
[38:21.720 --> 38:26.960]  Where you see everything and you see all the details and you can say oh they changed the size of these buttons
[38:26.960 --> 38:28.960]  Or they changed the color
[38:29.000 --> 38:30.080]  Oh
[38:30.080 --> 38:36.680]  They redid the disk utility window, right? It wasn't like you like when they redid disk utility a few years ago
[38:36.680 --> 38:41.960]  It wasn't like there was any question in your mind. Did they change disk utility? You could see it. Whereas
[38:42.480 --> 38:45.200]  With the voice assistant, you can never quite be sure
[38:45.920 --> 38:50.520]  But like I have noticed this summer it has been very very hot in Philadelphia
[38:50.520 --> 38:53.980]  and I one of the things I do most frequently with
[38:54.880 --> 38:59.360]  Siri is asked for the weather because I might be getting dressed in the morning or something
[38:59.360 --> 39:02.840]  I don't have my watch on yet or I don't have my phone in my hand and
[39:02.840 --> 39:08.560]  And I have noticed that she hasn't once this summer given me any kind of smart alecky
[39:10.520 --> 39:15.600]  Hot you know because it's 101 degrees you could like turn that down a little bit all that annoying well
[39:15.960 --> 39:23.280]  Personality, I think they have but maybe I'm getting a bad sample size, you know, like I can't prove it
[39:23.880 --> 39:25.680]  but I'm
[39:25.680 --> 39:32.840]  Specifically thinking about the hot temperatures or what was and in the winter. She does burr or cold. Yeah, it's always it's always like about
[39:34.120 --> 39:40.760]  40% more words than you wanted her to give you in response to anything and it's oftentimes like a lot a lot more
[39:41.160 --> 39:49.320]  Personality than is warranted by the accuracy and helpfulness of the assistant. It's like like I feel like if the assistant's gonna be
[39:49.320 --> 39:55.520]  Fairly primitive, you know in grand terms and and not and it's gonna keep making mistakes
[39:55.560 --> 39:58.800]  A lot the way many of these assistants do and especially Siri
[39:58.960 --> 40:06.320]  I feel like it shouldn't exhibit a lot of personality because if it's if it's doing something wrong and then it says burr
[40:06.600 --> 40:09.640]  You're just annoyed you like you want to throw out the window at that point like it
[40:09.640 --> 40:15.440]  You know give give a little personality as a little person always possible until it's actually like earned and I feel like none of these
[40:15.440 --> 40:19.880]  Assistants are good enough that they've earned the ability to start making smartass comments up back at you, right?
[40:19.880 --> 40:26.600]  And I feel like like one of the ones for me is I have two contacts in my contacts database
[40:27.640 --> 40:30.000]  For women whose first name is Amy
[40:30.880 --> 40:32.880]  one of them I
[40:32.880 --> 40:35.080]  Sent text messages to all the time
[40:35.680 --> 40:41.640]  And the other is somebody I have a professional relationship with and I don't believe I've spoken to her since like 2015
[40:41.640 --> 40:45.920]  But I don't want to delete the contact. I feel like maybe you have to rename her
[40:45.920 --> 40:50.120]  I maybe but then I feel like I'll forget what I renamed her. I guess I know her last name
[40:51.240 --> 40:52.720]  but it's
[40:52.720 --> 40:59.200]  It's a little interaction that bothers me every single time when I'll say, you know
[40:59.200 --> 41:05.280]  Text to Amy something something and they'll say which Amy and then I have to pick and it never learns and it never learns
[41:05.280 --> 41:07.280]  and it just feels like
[41:07.840 --> 41:09.720]  the
[41:09.720 --> 41:11.720]  Like I could hire the worst
[41:12.520 --> 41:14.480]  personal assistant in the world
[41:14.480 --> 41:17.120]  I could go to a local college and
[41:17.400 --> 41:24.260]  Say give me somebody who's on drugs and it's flunking out and I'll hire hire that person as my personal personal assistant
[41:24.720 --> 41:30.440]  They could be you know, really bad personal assistant. I could be fretting I could say I think I got a fire this person
[41:30.440 --> 41:31.360]  It's not working out
[41:31.360 --> 41:37.960]  But if I told my assistant text my wife that I'm gonna be late or text Amy, right?
[41:37.960 --> 41:40.360]  Yeah, I'm gonna be late. They would know to text my wife
[41:40.360 --> 41:45.640]  Yeah, even the worst assistant a human would always have to have the judgment to know that context
[41:45.640 --> 41:46.280]  I mean, yeah
[41:46.280 --> 41:52.240]  like right now like we have kind of a dual system family like we we had the Amazon echo before we had the home pod and
[41:52.240 --> 41:54.160]  we still have both and
[41:54.160 --> 41:57.200]  So do we yeah and it's so bad and we recently
[41:57.880 --> 42:02.160]  Like Tiff took over the echo as hers like we reassigned it to entirely hers
[42:02.240 --> 42:07.380]  So it's it's all her accounts registered to her and everything and the home pod stays with me
[42:07.380 --> 42:13.040]  And so we always joke that now we have like two dim assistants that are just kind of dim in different ways
[42:13.520 --> 42:17.480]  And like you ask one of them to do something and it totally bombs out
[42:17.480 --> 42:21.680]  Yes, the other one. It'll usually get it right, but it's not like one of them is never
[42:22.200 --> 42:25.580]  There isn't just one that that's so good that we can keep just that one
[42:25.920 --> 42:30.960]  ultimately what I hope is happening here and maybe this is a bad example because we haven't seen the result of the
[42:31.120 --> 42:32.920]  Big like maps rewrite yet
[42:32.920 --> 42:39.160]  I know there were some concern that it might actually not be as good as we were hoping but assuming that it does get good
[42:39.160 --> 42:45.640]  I hope there is something like the the great maps rewrite going on for Siri, you know, they hired John Gendrea
[42:46.080 --> 42:49.720]  What about two years ago now a year ago something like that? I think it was two years ago something like that
[42:49.720 --> 42:52.360]  Yeah, and maybe what's just last year. I don't know
[42:52.760 --> 42:56.960]  They hired him like in any early recently, right and he's he got promoted to SVP
[42:56.960 --> 43:05.120]  and so like clearly like there was there's a major shift of Syria leadership with somebody who was very qualified to do this kind of
[43:05.120 --> 43:05.840]  thing
[43:05.840 --> 43:10.420]  In in a way that I think was probably way better than the way Apple is doing it before so hopefully
[43:11.040 --> 43:18.280]  There is some kind of great effort going on to really transform Syria and really bring it at least up to the level of the
[43:18.660 --> 43:20.660]  Amazon echo and the Google whatever
[43:20.760 --> 43:22.760]  Hopefully it gets past that level
[43:22.760 --> 43:26.960]  But but just to at least meet it in some of the basics like Siri
[43:26.960 --> 43:32.160]  Yes, here is ahead in some areas, but it still falls behind in some of the basics of like reliability
[43:32.880 --> 43:40.360]  performance some basic logic basic learning like it's still way behind even even where the Amazon echo was like three years ago in a
[43:40.360 --> 43:44.440]  lot of those areas, so I hope they're I hope and I and I
[43:44.880 --> 43:48.960]  Assume that they actually are doing some kind of great Siri reset behind the scenes
[43:48.960 --> 43:53.280]  Although honestly, I've heard nothing to that effect and it's you know, it's so hard
[43:53.920 --> 43:56.400]  It's obviously a very hard problem domain
[43:57.760 --> 44:03.680]  But like if if I only understood my wife as often as Syria understands my wife
[44:03.680 --> 44:09.000]  she would she would be concerned and take you know, tell me I need to go get my hearing checked at the doctor because
[44:09.000 --> 44:18.040]  This isn't working out and the problems go beyond hearing right here. He hears me great. Oh, see she she hears something but it's
[44:19.320 --> 44:26.120]  Like Amy for whatever reason Amy it, you know a fine podcaster in her own right speaks very clearly
[44:28.480 --> 44:33.520]  But it's shocking to me how often like when like her miss rate on
[44:33.520 --> 44:40.920]  Like doing some of our home kit stuff like with the lights or the shades or something like that is really low or and and she'll
[44:40.920 --> 44:42.920]  say stuff like
[44:43.920 --> 44:45.920]  Open open the kitchen shades
[44:45.960 --> 44:52.400]  And and one of the things that's great about Siri is that Siri doesn't make you do like a command line
[44:52.400 --> 44:58.480]  You have to use the words the same way. You can say right open open the shades in the kitchen open the kitchen shades
[44:58.560 --> 45:01.560]  You don't have to program a scene with those specific names
[45:01.560 --> 45:04.960]  should generally just figure it out, but but
[45:07.200 --> 45:13.320]  It's just we have one where the main floor of our house is a couple of different rooms so I do have a scene
[45:14.200 --> 45:16.040]  called
[45:16.040 --> 45:23.640]  Open main floor shades and that just opens all of them and Amy will say open main floor shades exactly and Siri
[45:23.640 --> 45:26.400]  Will say I'm sorry. I don't have anything by that name
[45:26.400 --> 45:32.840]  so the one common issue I have a Siri is if you're saying something that is
[45:33.360 --> 45:36.620]  Close to a common word. It's almost like my like snap to grid thing
[45:36.620 --> 45:41.520]  Like if you're saying something that's close to a common word, but it's not but it's like a different word
[45:42.040 --> 45:46.080]  Sometimes Siri will hear it as that common word every single time no matter how you say it
[45:46.080 --> 45:48.840]  So one example of this is like when Siri first came out
[45:49.100 --> 45:54.300]  You could say you could tell your phone like if your name like in my case if your name was Tiffany
[45:54.300 --> 45:58.520]  You could say call me Tiff and it would say okay from now and I will call you whatever you said
[45:58.520 --> 45:59.960]  but in this case
[45:59.960 --> 46:06.320]  She could not get Siri to say that it would just say everything no matter how she or I pronounced it every single time
[46:06.320 --> 46:08.320]  It would say okay. I will call you test
[46:09.040 --> 46:12.260]  Every single time and and and even you know that and that was years ago now
[46:12.260 --> 46:16.920]  But even now with the home pod like they added the name timer support finally. Thank God. It's great
[46:16.920 --> 46:20.880]  I wish it would come to iOS but cool where you know start with the home pod at least that's good and
[46:20.880 --> 46:23.220]  You know some mornings
[46:23.220 --> 46:28.340]  I'll make some bacon and eggs and I will say start a bacon timer for 12 minutes with the bacon in the oven
[46:28.860 --> 46:35.420]  Every single time. Okay. I've started a baking timer every time no matter how I say bacon
[46:35.420 --> 46:38.420]  I cannot get it to not say back to me bacon
[46:38.420 --> 46:45.960]  All right, and it you would think like if you were talking to a person you you could say start a bacon timer BAC
[46:45.960 --> 46:51.660]  On yeah, right. Yeah, you can clarify. Yeah, and and there's no way to clarify like that and it's just like the yeah
[46:53.140 --> 46:56.660]  You just sort of start to break down, you know, I don't know
[46:56.980 --> 47:00.500]  But maybe I think I'm saying it like with an apostrophe instead of yeah at the end bacon
[47:00.500 --> 47:06.100]  I'll be I'm just baking out here just dropping your G's. Yeah, right. Yeah start a bacon timer bacon. I
[47:07.020 --> 47:09.660]  Also think that the name timer thing was interesting
[47:09.660 --> 47:17.780]  That you know the home pod well and home pod was single-timer only you couldn't name them and it was single-timers
[47:19.500 --> 47:24.020]  And the reaction from some people at Apple PR was
[47:24.540 --> 47:29.500]  Okay, it's you know, it's a good feature. But you know, is this really that big a deal and yes it is
[47:29.820 --> 47:35.120]  well, and I and the thing is is I think it it was an instance where
[47:35.120 --> 47:42.600]  the cultural insularity of Apple where a lot of Apple employees really only use Apple stuff and
[47:43.240 --> 47:51.240]  If they so if they didn't if they weren't used to having an echo where you can do that and do it in the kitchen
[47:51.320 --> 47:53.800]  It's like you you're totally missing the point
[47:53.800 --> 47:58.960]  it's like the main reason to buy an echo really and put it in your kitchen is to have these name timers that you don't
[47:58.960 --> 48:00.920]  have to touch and that you can
[48:00.920 --> 48:07.040]  Query, you know, how much time is left on the pizza and get it very accurate answer and I think too
[48:07.040 --> 48:11.000]  I mean this this was a larger problem with the home pod in general at the home pod was such a a
[48:12.160 --> 48:13.960]  poor market fit
[48:13.960 --> 48:18.220]  Because maybe the way Apple saw it was the way they priced it and the way they marketed it
[48:18.220 --> 48:21.960]  Which is this is something you put like in a living room and in that kind of context
[48:21.960 --> 48:24.260]  Maybe you don't need multiple name timers very often
[48:24.320 --> 48:30.400]  But the market has a very different opinion the market says one of the best places for a voice cylinder is in the kitchen
[48:30.400 --> 48:34.920]  Yeah, and whether or not Apple want to position there's as such they and you know
[48:34.920 --> 48:39.120]  That's part of the reason why everyone says it's too expensive. It's like yeah, it's a pretty good $300 speaker
[48:39.120 --> 48:44.160]  But like, you know, it's not it's not competitive in the market of voice cylinders
[48:44.160 --> 48:51.180]  And it's because voice cylinders cost a hundred bucks and most people naturally don't want to spend home entertainment system dollars for something
[48:51.180 --> 48:57.120]  That's just a gadget in the kitchen, right? And especially that that integrates so poorly into any other type of a home theater system
[48:57.120 --> 49:02.120]  System you really kind of can't use a home pod easily with pretty much anything else
[49:02.160 --> 49:07.360]  So it is like a standalone thing. It actually is a really good kitchen speaker
[49:07.360 --> 49:11.540]  It's very expensive for that purpose. But if you can swing it, it's a pretty good one
[49:12.320 --> 49:16.400]  But I gotta say the echo is still better because the echo is more reliable
[49:16.480 --> 49:20.340]  It's named timer support is better and more reliable and faster
[49:20.760 --> 49:26.000]  And they have the various models that have the screens which honestly I've I tried the very first echo show with the screen
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.440]  Yeah, I remember you returned it within like a day. I'm like, nope. It was terrible, but I hear the new ones are better
[49:31.200 --> 49:32.720]  but you know
[49:32.720 --> 49:38.040]  Whether or not Apple wants the market to believe where it wants to position its products
[49:38.360 --> 49:42.640]  It doesn't really matter what Apple wants the market to believe the markets gonna believe what it's gonna believe
[49:42.640 --> 49:46.300]  And so if the market says a voice assistant cylinder speaker thing
[49:46.440 --> 49:50.680]  Should be about a hundred bucks and should have multiple named timers because we're gonna put it in our kitchens
[49:51.280 --> 49:55.320]  You know Apple can only do so much to change that perception because they want to make something more expensive
[49:55.320 --> 49:56.480]  That's more home theater focus
[49:56.480 --> 50:02.400]  like the reality is that's what the market wants and so far that has proven to be what people still want the home pod to
[50:02.400 --> 50:07.000]  Be like Apple hasn't moved the market towards them. The market just kind of left them behind
[50:07.200 --> 50:10.240]  It makes me wonder what they're working on what their plans are for home pod
[50:10.240 --> 50:13.440]  Like I could see them going in either direction
[50:13.440 --> 50:16.520]  I could see them expanding it to be you know
[50:16.520 --> 50:19.120]  Which is what they did with the iPod back in the day where they'd have multiple
[50:19.760 --> 50:23.680]  iPods of different sizes and hitting lower price points
[50:23.680 --> 50:25.680]  I
[50:25.720 --> 50:32.560]  Could see them making a smaller one that is less expensive and maybe still sounds really good for its size or I could see them
[50:32.680 --> 50:37.880]  Completely dropping it and getting out of the business of making it. Yeah, I mean cuz to some to some degree
[50:37.880 --> 50:43.080]  I think they might argue that the kitchen home pod is called the iPad right, you know
[50:43.080 --> 50:46.200]  And I don't I don't think that's necessarily a good replacement
[50:46.600 --> 50:50.920]  But that is I think what a lot of their marketing would would would try to have you believe
[50:50.920 --> 50:53.680]  And for some people it is a good replacement
[50:53.680 --> 50:57.960]  Like if you want like a device that responds to voice commands and can play music and stuff and has a screen to show you
[50:57.960 --> 51:02.560]  Stuff. Yeah, actually an iPad is pretty good for that. And I do I do use my iPad in the kitchen very frequently
[51:02.560 --> 51:04.160]  It's a great kitchen device
[51:04.160 --> 51:05.560]  but you know
[51:05.560 --> 51:11.100]  I I think what's most likely to happen with the home pod is I think they they're just gonna kind of slowly
[51:11.240 --> 51:16.160]  Peter out and eventually bow to the market similar to how they did with Wi-Fi routers for similar reasons
[51:16.160 --> 51:20.280]  That's exactly I was trying to think about what I was thinking of and I was thinking about the way that they got out
[51:20.280 --> 51:22.280]  of the Wi-Fi routers
[51:23.160 --> 51:28.040]  Even though they in some ways I think deserve credit for starting it
[51:28.040 --> 51:31.980]  You know that Airport was like one of the first highly publicized Wi-Fi systems
[51:31.980 --> 51:37.680]  I mean it was you know, they did the hula hoop. Yeah. Yeah, you know, it was all it was all radical
[51:37.680 --> 51:39.920]  They had Phil Schiller jumping off off a 20-foot
[51:39.920 --> 51:48.460]  Platform mm-hmm to show that the accelerometer working on the on the thing and it's still broadcasting. Yeah
[51:49.080 --> 51:54.120]  Wi-Fi yeah, but ultimately like I don't I don't think like they're never gonna compete
[51:54.120 --> 52:01.160]  well against Amazon because Amazon is so good at making really cheap hardware that if you don't care so much about like the
[52:01.640 --> 52:07.760]  Materials quality and design and UI quality. I mean Amazon's uis are atrocious for the for their products that do have screens
[52:07.760 --> 52:13.080]  They're horrendous but but if you don't care about all that stuff and you just want a voice assistant cylinder that can play music
[52:13.080 --> 52:15.080]  And have multiple timers in your kitchen
[52:15.400 --> 52:19.720]  Amazon is gonna kill them over and over and over again at that Apple is just not good at making
[52:20.280 --> 52:27.900]  Cheap frequently updated like commodity hardware that interacts with a frequently updated web service that interact integrate with a bunch of third-party things
[52:27.900 --> 52:31.860]  like none of that's an Apple's DNA and so I think the HomePod is
[52:31.860 --> 52:38.380]  You know rather than become competitive by having a wider range or spans multiple price points and making Siri really good on it
[52:38.380 --> 52:42.020]  I think the more likely outcome is they just slowly bow out, you know
[52:42.020 --> 52:45.240]  They're already doing a whole lot of airplay to hardware with other hardware partners
[52:45.240 --> 52:49.820]  I think that's that's that's the first step in getting themselves out of this business and then you know
[52:49.820 --> 52:52.780]  Give it a couple more years where I play two is in more products that themselves
[52:53.220 --> 52:59.460]  Have voices it's built in like that like Sonos has a couple I think apples out of this business in a couple years
[52:59.460 --> 53:02.700]  Yeah, and something like Sonos is you know?
[53:04.020 --> 53:09.140]  It's so much more flexible because they've got like a whole range of products, you know, it's
[53:10.020 --> 53:13.860]  Yeah, I like HomePod as a product a lot, but it is not
[53:15.380 --> 53:18.160]  Like I wouldn't want it to be my TV sound system
[53:18.580 --> 53:21.900]  Well, and honestly they sound great like if you get a stereo pair of them
[53:21.900 --> 53:27.380]  They sound awesome, but they have no inputs and they and you can you can make them work with an Apple TV
[53:27.380 --> 53:29.460]  But it's pretty hard
[53:29.460 --> 53:33.620]  But it's a little clumsy to do that and it's nearly impossible to make them work well with anything else
[53:33.620 --> 53:39.100]  Right, and so it's it's just not like Apple did a really good job engineering the microphones
[53:39.100 --> 53:42.500]  They did a really good job engineering the sound it looks kind of cool
[53:42.620 --> 53:47.040]  It's a good size it like it is a really nice product for a narrow
[53:47.780 --> 53:52.900]  for a narrow set of use cases and unfortunately that that set of use cases is too narrow for the market and
[53:52.900 --> 53:58.560]  It's the kind of thing that I would love for Apple to keep going on that and make it better
[53:58.700 --> 54:02.580]  Make Siri support behind it better make the software better make the hardware
[54:02.580 --> 54:06.740]  You know move it forward make a bigger range make smaller ones make bigger ones. I would love that
[54:06.740 --> 54:09.460]  I just don't think they're gonna do it if they did it
[54:09.460 --> 54:13.980]  I think they could be better than everyone if they really put their heart behind it and if they really
[54:14.220 --> 54:20.660]  You know make Siri really good as the general, you know initiative that I hope is happening there and really put their back into HomePod
[54:20.660 --> 54:25.520]  I think they could really make it amazing and I would love that because I would like that way better than all the other alternatives
[54:25.520 --> 54:29.500]  That are kind of creepy and made with crappy hardware, but I just I just don't see it happening
[54:29.660 --> 54:35.460]  it's also a little frustrating knowing that it comes from the same company that made AirPods which are amazing and
[54:36.420 --> 54:38.340]  in a lot of ways are a
[54:38.340 --> 54:45.460]  Sibling product, you know, they're wireless you you talk to Siri. You're you're listening to music and
[54:46.180 --> 54:47.500]  everybody
[54:47.500 --> 54:50.780]  Everybody I know I know you have issues with the fitting in your ears
[54:51.380 --> 54:58.180]  But other than like what if you think that they're comfortable most people absolutely love AirPods. It would be interesting to see
[55:00.100 --> 55:01.340]  Somehow
[55:01.340 --> 55:03.340]  Rub some of that AirPod magic on
[55:04.260 --> 55:09.580]  Yeah, and I mean, I think ultimately it's it just again comes down to like what?
[55:10.140 --> 55:14.780]  How much are they willing to play in that commodity hardware business? Like how cheap are they willing to make this thing?
[55:14.780 --> 55:16.780]  How how well are they able to compete?
[55:16.780 --> 55:20.180]  To get you know, I'm not saying they have to beat or match the echoes price
[55:20.220 --> 55:23.780]  but they have to get closer to it like that, you know, it has to cost like
[55:24.460 --> 55:27.140]  30 or 50 percent more not like 300 percent
[55:27.940 --> 55:34.740]  It's sort of in a way that AirPods are they're expensive for earpods, you know, what I still 160 bucks 150
[55:34.740 --> 55:38.540]  I think the base is 170 now or something and the wireless charging is 200. Yeah
[55:40.140 --> 55:42.500]  But when you compare them to the highest rated
[55:42.500 --> 55:45.340]  Wireless buds from other companies
[55:46.100 --> 55:52.060]  Like I just read a review last week of somebody somebody was reviewing the new Sony ones which seemed like a really good product
[55:52.740 --> 55:58.100]  But they're more expensive. Yeah, the AirPods are actually pretty price competitive for what they are for the other for the you know
[55:58.100 --> 55:59.180]  other competitive
[55:59.180 --> 56:04.140]  You know both small wireless buds and just like the market of generally like decent
[56:04.380 --> 56:10.420]  Bluetooth had decent portable Bluetooth headphones. They're all around 200 bucks at least so like it's actually you know
[56:10.420 --> 56:14.260]  That those are actually pretty well priced for what they are. So we know Apple can do it
[56:14.780 --> 56:20.060]  But the HomePod, I think I think they wanted they wanted to kill Sonos with it
[56:20.940 --> 56:26.380]  Unfortunately, they didn't right and they didn't come anywhere near competing with the echo family
[56:27.180 --> 56:33.300]  Alright, let's take a break. Thank our next sponsor. It's another another company Marco. It's very familiar with Linode
[56:33.300 --> 56:39.300]  Oh, yeah Linode is proud to announce their newest data center in Toronto, Canada built using their most up-to-date
[56:39.300 --> 56:42.140]  hardware and their next-generation network backbone
[56:42.780 --> 56:47.540]  Linode Toronto allows users to comply with in-country data protect protection
[56:48.060 --> 56:52.500]  Requirements while taking advantage of all Linode's technology and tools
[56:52.500 --> 56:55.980]  So if you are in Canada and you have some kind of legal compliance
[56:55.980 --> 57:00.420]  You need a Canadian data server data center Linode has you covered now. I
[57:01.180 --> 57:03.660]  Think India to that the Mumbai one I think just opened
[57:03.660 --> 57:07.980]  I don't know my talking points might be out of date on that but that's another I know that was the other one
[57:07.980 --> 57:10.940]  I know that was the other one that was on the on the agenda
[57:10.940 --> 57:16.220]  Here's what they get you get a $20 credit for all new customers and they have a five dollar a month plan
[57:16.220 --> 57:17.820]  Which is actually pretty good
[57:17.820 --> 57:22.940]  It's a pretty good plan that a lot of people could get by with you get that's effectively four months of free service
[57:23.820 --> 57:29.420]  And they've got everything you could possibly need. I don't even know what some of this stuff is, but you can get a dedicated
[57:30.220 --> 57:32.220]  CPU
[57:32.220 --> 57:37.640]  CI CD environments, I don't even know what that is Casey knows what that is kind of like testing thing
[57:38.500 --> 57:45.100]  Everything features native SSD storage. Of course. It's all a 40 gigabit network industry leading processors
[57:45.100 --> 57:53.020]  And again, they have 10 worldwide data centers might be 11 says here additional data center opening in Mumbai India by the end of 2019
[57:53.020 --> 57:55.460]  Yeah, I think it either is about to open or just did open
[57:56.140 --> 58:01.560]  You pay for what you use with hourly billing across all plans and add-on services
[58:01.560 --> 58:04.380]  So if suddenly you got a big deal big announcement
[58:04.380 --> 58:08.300]  You need to you need to increase your bandwidth get more RAM
[58:08.300 --> 58:11.980]  You can do that on the fly dial it back down when the traffic is over
[58:12.740 --> 58:19.260]  And they have a brand new cloud manager featuring an improved user interface at cloud dot linode.com. You can check it out
[58:20.740 --> 58:22.740]  Anyway great company
[58:23.420 --> 58:27.340]  I'm a customer. Everything I do is going to be hosted there pretty soon
[58:27.340 --> 58:31.180]  I'm not quite there yet, but I know Marco hosts
[58:31.180 --> 58:38.220]  Oh, yeah overcast and Marco org and the ATP livestream and it's all it's all Linode. I absolutely love it. It's the best
[58:38.220 --> 58:42.180]  Well, here's the talk. Here's the promo code you need talk show 2019
[58:42.220 --> 58:47.020]  No, the just talk show 2019 and that's what gets you the $20 credit
[58:47.260 --> 58:53.100]  But the URL is linode.com slash the talk show my thanks to Linode
[58:54.020 --> 58:56.020]  Go check them out if you need a web server
[58:56.020 --> 58:58.380]  Did you see the essay? I just linked to it the other day
[58:59.300 --> 59:06.180]  Craig mod. Yeah, but performance the fast software fast software is great software. Yeah. Yeah, that was really good. He said he's a great writer
[59:06.180 --> 59:08.180]  I've known Craig for years
[59:08.300 --> 59:10.300]  Very very thoughtful guy
[59:10.420 --> 59:13.180]  And it's funny because he's writing about fast software
[59:13.700 --> 59:17.060]  But it struck a chord with me because it's something I've thought about
[59:17.060 --> 59:21.380]  I mean, I've spent hundreds of hours here on the show talking about software quality
[59:22.180 --> 59:24.180]  but the very
[59:24.180 --> 59:26.180]  specific nature of software that
[59:26.860 --> 59:33.980]  feels fast and responsive and that the way that that makes him feel that that software is well-built and
[59:34.460 --> 59:37.860]  when you're using an app like one of his examples was
[59:39.260 --> 59:42.700]  the web export dialogue in Photoshop and
[59:44.160 --> 59:48.860]  You know, that's a dialog box. A lot of people have to use a lot of time and it's I
[59:48.860 --> 59:54.980]  I like I literally think that it's like a dialog box that was written using chromium or something like that
[59:54.980 --> 59:59.460]  Like they're actually firing up like a web browser inside the window takes you hit the command
[59:59.700 --> 01:00:04.980]  Takes a couple seconds before the dialogue even appears makes you feel it makes you not trust the software
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:07.580]  And it makes it feel
[01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:13.860]  Just crappy. It feels it feels like almost uncared for right because like, you know a lot of times
[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:16.680]  You know those of us who are who are you know lucky enough to be on?
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:22.200]  Fast hardware like if you buy like a nice Mac, you know a nice MacBook Pro or iMac or iMac Pro
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:22.960]  You know
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:27.200]  You got a lot of performance under that hood and if if then some software that you run
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:31.040]  Performs horribly doing some common tasks like showing its new file dialog
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:36.080]  You kind of know like this is not a hardware problem like and which makes it even more frustrating
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:42.560]  Like I have you know, all these cores of all this memory. I have this fast SSD all at your disposal software
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:48.100]  What are you wasting it on? Like what are you doing? Well and Photoshop is an interesting example because
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.760]  Photoshop used to be
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:54.840]  Amazingly fast and this was you know, we're talking like the early years
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:59.760]  Yeah, like early to mid 90s and
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:03.140]  The hardware at the time, you know
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:08.040]  I literally I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that it was hundreds of times slower than yeah
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:10.040]  I'm not a modern high-end desktop
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:16.600]  And in certain ways even like in things like IO even more like, you know, cuz first we got cheap RAM
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:20.660]  Then we got SSD right and like and like, you know in the 90s
[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:25.520]  Like I've said before like the sound of computing in the 90s was the sound of your hard drive grinding, right?
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:31.840]  Because you know because hard drives were slow to begin with and also RAM was incredibly expensive in the 90s
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.200]  And so it was you know
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:39.200]  Nobody had enough RAM to do what the operating systems and everything wanted to do. So just constant swapping just constant hard drive grinding
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.760]  Well, I forget the exact details of it
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:47.520]  But I remember in those early years when everything was so limited Photoshop even had its own custom swap disk code
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:54.140]  Yeah, I think it had to yeah because they couldn't trust they I think they wanted to write their own code because it was so
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:56.000]  mission-critical but
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.400]  It just wasn't something that the OS really provided at the time
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:01:59.960]  Yeah
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:04.920]  Or at least not all the OS's that ran on would have provided it and you used to have to wait for so much stuff
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:12.060]  In Photoshop not because again, I'm the app felt fast and if there was something you needed to do in an export dialog
[01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:14.580]  And you and you did it all the time because you're using Photoshop
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:20.440]  So you have the keyboard shortcut memorized you'd hit that keyboard shortcut and the dialogue was there instantly
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:23.360]  no waiting the things you'd have to wait for was the
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  computationally
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:32.920]  Difficult stuff like if you're applying a Gaussian blur to a right at the time what we thought of as large JPEGs
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.940]  Yeah, right and then you know 40 by 480
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:41.040]  But even that there was certain there was even though you had to wait you might wait like
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:44.200]  30-40 seconds to apply a filter to a photograph
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:50.760]  But everything about it was responsive the dialog box appeared as soon as you hit the command
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.800]  the
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:59.380]  Actual filter started being applied the second you hit the return key or click the button to do it on screen
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:03.580]  The progress dialog would appear instantly
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:09.100]  Would update at a regular basis and then as soon as it got to the end of the progress bar to the pixel
[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:11.700]  It would disappear and you would see your result
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:17.820]  Like that that's it was a slow process because the computers were so slow
[01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:24.100]  but the the responsiveness to your user actions was impeccable and
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:28.580]  It's just an interesting contrast that we have these faster computers and now
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:32.020]  Slower interfaces. Well, I think you know
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:38.180]  You could say a lot a lot of the same things apply to the original iPhone that the original iPhone was very slow hardware
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:40.380]  Really like compared to anything
[01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:43.580]  But at the time it was like this is the best we can do. So let's deal with it
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:49.540]  and so they they actually really engineered the software with with tons of of effort to
[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:55.740]  Maximize responsiveness while they knew they'd be waiting for the hardware. So, you know things like the Safari drawing a little grid
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:58.860]  Well, you know before things would render and stuff like that checkerboard. Yeah
[01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:03.540]  Yeah, the checkerboard is scrolled too fast. You'd get ahead right it would only it because it was so RAM constrained
[01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:06.420]  They couldn't read do the whole front page of the New York Times
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:11.820]  So they'd render the top of it and then as you scrolled they would render more of it on the fly
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:13.100]  But if you've scrolled too fast
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:17.260]  They would just show you that checkerboard so that it was always responsive to your touch and and there's all the you know
[01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:22.140]  All the stuff, you know deep in the system about things like being responsive to touches and scrolling being very smooth and things like that
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:26.660]  And you know and they did all this because they knew the hardware was very constrained
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:30.740]  So they had they they took a lot of effort and were very conscientious about
[01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:33.460]  Making sure everything stayed fast as much as possible
[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:39.420]  while they knew they'd be waiting on the hardware to do some more complicated things and that's how early computers were to like early computers like
[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:46.420]  in the 90s and 80s and even the early 2000s like they they they too were very constrained by their hardware and
[01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:47.820]  so
[01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:51.000]  Programmers at the time both OS and application programmers
[01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:55.560]  Had to be more conscientious about what they did and and I think what has happened in
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:57.820]  Probably the last 10 years or so
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:03.860]  Is that hardware has gotten so good and so fast and we have so much CPU power so much RAM
[01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:07.820]  SSDs came around to eliminate a lot of IO bottlenecks and now
[01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:14.840]  Programmers at almost every level don't really have to think about performance for most of the things they write anymore
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:17.800]  So even though the hardware is faster than ever
[01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:19.380]  also
[01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:25.520]  Programmers have stopped caring about performance unless it's really a big problem and as you get into things like big companies
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:29.520]  Like Adobe and working on big projects like Photoshop
[01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:37.020]  The argument for like we need to make the new dialogue fast has to go through so many people and they have so many conflicting
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:41.780]  Priorities of things like well if we write this code once using web technologies
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:47.260]  it can run on all of our platform at the same code look the same fit our branding guidelines and all those other crap and
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:53.620]  Performance is not an on in top of anybody's mind anymore because everything is so fast
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:06:00.780]  probably half the team working on stuff like that has never had to write performance code and it's sort of just sort of a
[01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:02.420]  loss of the sense of
[01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:08.020]  Craftsmanship. Yeah in the work and another example and you know right up your alley and from your
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:10.820]  personal experience is
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:16.900]  Tumblr was always very fast. I haven't used it in a while. I don't know if that's actually there but still true
[01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.540]  but a
[01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:28.260]  Lot of CMS is you know, you save an article and then it sits there and spins for you know seconds at a time
[01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.500]  enough that it's like
[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:38.740]  You could see how somebody thought this is fine. You don't need who needs to be back at in control of your CMS
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:41.820]  instantaneously upon hitting the post button
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:44.180]  but
[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:46.220]  It's it's actually not true
[01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:52.620]  like my CMS is actually a little slow in that regard where it takes a couple seconds for when I post an article to
[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:58.700]  To get back in control of everything and when you notice the typo and you hit
[01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:02.900]  Update and you still have to wait like seven seconds before you can fix it
[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:05.980]  It's just sitting there right in front of you, but it's spinning
[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:11.900]  It'll drive you nuts. Whereas tumblr was always you hit publish and it was like did something happen. Yeah. Oh, yeah
[01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:16.100]  It's already done. There it is. There's there's my new there's my new picture of my kid
[01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:21.780]  well, and part of that is you know, you like your your CMS first of all was made back when RAM was expensive and
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:27.500]  And is and is also I believe rebuilding static files every time you publish. Yeah, but that shouldn't take long
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:32.460]  Oh, it shouldn't but you know you also if it's like rebuilding a bunch of archive pages or something then no then you might have
[01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:34.460]  Okay, so maybe not but anyway, it's just bad software
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:40.180]  Yeah, and and your and your software doesn't have to be that performing in that way because it has one user at a time
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:42.180]  Right like with tumblr
[01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:47.860]  Everything had to be really fast because if it wasn't the servers would explode
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:54.100]  Because it had so many users and so much traffic in any given time like things that we couldn't do quickly
[01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:58.140]  We just couldn't do right so like so everything was was designed
[01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:03.980]  And to a large degree overcast servers I've made the same way because I take a lot of the same design approaches to them
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:10.260]  Of basically like if something's going to be a very heavy operation that I can't do quickly. I just don't do it. I
[01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:18.140]  Thought I know I've talked about this before but what our podcast for other than retelling old stories
[01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:21.500]  But I thought one of the interesting changes Apple made philosophically
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:28.780]  would number one I'll go even further back out like I've been thinking a lot lately as the iPhone and
[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:31.020]  iOS settle in as
[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:35.860]  Long-standing platforms like they're not new. I mean, you know, we had the 10th year anniversary last year
[01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:38.460]  I mean, this is a well-established software platform
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:45.140]  But we went from the first version of Mac OS X to the iPhone in
[01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:52.700]  Like six years. I mean, I know that Apple spent like five years working on Mac OS X before it actually shipped as a 10.0
[01:08:54.220 --> 01:09:01.620]  But it that era from like 2001 to you know, and the iPod was new to
[01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:04.100]  Okay, here's the iPhone
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:05.940]  Feels like a long stretch of time
[01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:11.980]  but it wasn't it was very that's actually just a handful of years and a lot of the people were the same and
[01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:18.140]  I thought one of the interesting things that Apple obviously changed its mind about between Mac OS X and
[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:20.380]  the original
[01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:21.660]  iPhone
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:23.660]  Was what to make?
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:32.700]  Seem impressive with Mac OS X they they valued
[01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:36.100]  Rendering quality above all else
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:43.260]  so like when you and again this seems like a goofy thing to get excited about but back then when you'd resize a window and
[01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:49.780]  The contents would update live right as opposed to just drawing an outline and then refreshing once when you let go of the window
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:56.460]  That that seemed impressive and they were doing all of this fancy anti aliasing and then you know
[01:09:57.300 --> 01:10:00.540]  All these drop shadows and they had translucency
[01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:06.580]  They just went all way overboard with the quote-unquote lickability of the interface
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:12.980]  But it was slow it was slow to resize windows when you would drag a window around real fast
[01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:18.740]  You could see it shearing on screen and then six years later with the iPhone
[01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:22.060]  They went the other way and they were like if we can't keep up
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:27.140]  we'll just draw this checkerboard and make sure that the scrolling speed keeps up and
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:30.180]  I remember talking to somebody at Apple about this once
[01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:35.100]  And he told me an interesting story that
[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:41.660]  They knew that Mac OS X was slow they you know, there was they weren't fooling themselves that the
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:49.660]  What was the word everybody's the snappiness wasn't there and they set up a lab where they what was the?
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:55.620]  Version of Windows that would have been current in like 2001 XP. Yeah, I think it was XP
[01:10:55.620 --> 01:11:01.380]  Yeah. Yeah, it was XP. So they had a lab and they used high-speed cameras and
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:09.940]  Timed things like you click on the file menu and how many milliseconds does it take for the drop-down menu to?
[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:12.420]  to finish rendering and
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:20.020]  if you drag your mouse down the menu and it starts highlighting things how quickly after the mouse gets there does the highlight come and
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:25.660]  They tested, you know Mac OS X side, but they had a whole list. He said of things that we timed
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:28.500]  that were mostly just rendering things and
[01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:31.700]  Their gold standard was XP
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:35.300]  They won't you know, they're like look at how much faster all of this is and sure they weren't
[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:38.820]  It wasn't as fancy looking but they wanted you know, this is our goal
[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:41.820]  to get it as fast as this and
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:43.500]  You know
[01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:47.460]  It's the sort of thing that they're never gonna talk about publicly because they're not gonna admit
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:51.820]  That there's their stuff wasn't slow and Windows was fast
[01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:55.420]  but then the funny thing is when Windows 7 shipped they
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:59.540]  Installed it and they set up another machine and they realized everything had gotten slow
[01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:02.620]  And they didn't know what to do
[01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:08.900]  And he said it was a real fight within the company as to whether they should still be benchmarking themselves against XP
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:14.340]  Because that was the fast one and there were others who were like no see they're slow to that's now we're fine
[01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:18.740]  This is all interesting. That's it's kind of sad that that was even a debate. Yeah
[01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:22.620]  Well, the the people who wanted to keep testing on XP won the debate. I hope so
[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:27.220]  Yeah, because it's like oh, yeah, everyone else sucks. We can suck too. It's a terrible argument, right?
[01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:32.100]  But I but I think that's sort of the nut
[01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:36.000]  like why did Craig mod write this essay because there's
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:41.180]  So many people out there doing work who don't have that philosophy. I'm like, ah, yeah, it takes four seconds
[01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:46.300]  It takes four seconds. Well, and I feel like it's even it's we're talking about a lot of times smaller times than that like
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.740]  it's like like one of the
[01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:51.220]  one of the tricky things about
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:57.020]  Trying to match responsiveness of like old hardware is like it used to be that when you
[01:12:57.260 --> 01:12:58.940]  Pressed a key on your keyboard
[01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:03.740]  It would generate a hardware interrupt and and it would basically like appear
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:08.640]  Immediately on the screen like within some tiny amount of time because of like and and that but that depended on
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:13.640]  how the keyboard technology worked how the screen technology works like the cathode gun like how
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.280]  All that stuff worked to get that level of responsiveness
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:23.280]  hardware today is way more complicated than that and there's all these different levels and layers and a lot of things that introduce small amounts of
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.200]  Latency like like having keyboards be wireless, you know stuff like that
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:29.960]  Like there's there's all these like little levels of latency that are the result of
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:33.100]  Technological advancement of like the hardware got better in certain ways
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.100]  It got more capable more complicated
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:38.720]  The OS has got more advanced and there's different layers of everything now
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:41.120]  so a lot of that's just down to the end of that but then like I
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:44.960]  feel like the the big challenge that we have with software is not
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:48.920]  Not the things take four seconds when they should take one
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:54.080]  But that things that should take 20 milliseconds take 200 milliseconds
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:58.160]  so we're talking about like much smaller time intervals here, but
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:02.880]  that adds up and or simple things like how I believe you said before how
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:06.640]  when you do when you invoke spotlight with command space on a Mac or
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:12.240]  when you when you like open a new window on a Mac or do something like that and then you start typing the commands of
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:15.240]  What you want to appear in like a text field or a name or something?
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:19.680]  It'll cue up those commands and it will it will put them in as soon as it can on
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:22.880]  iOS if you hit command space with the keyboard on an iPad Pro
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:29.240]  It doesn't start accepting input until it has finished the animation and showing you the text box and there's like there's little things like that
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:32.920]  We're like that is the responsiveness. Oh, it hasn't been uh, uh
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:40.200]  Don't quote me on this but I actually think it is shipped in the latest version of iOS 12 a little birdie
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:42.720]  just a little birdie who saw my rant about that was like
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.480]  Told me that this drives some of us nuts, too
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:49.880]  we've
[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:53.400]  We're gonna try to sneak up don't say anything, but you know, don't quote me
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:59.400]  But but I think that I think they fixed it. I and I think they're definitely supposedly fixed it for iOS 13
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:00.800]  I don't understand how that ever shipped
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:04.700]  Like how does that not because if you would think that if you are on?
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:11.920]  The spotlight team like you're one of the people who's you're you're one of your jobs is to program the spotlight
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:14.360]  interface on iOS
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:19.280]  Wouldn't you think that you're really good at using spotlight and that you might start with the ink?
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:19.560]  well
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:25.600]  but also like I'm sure it was probably one of the situations where like, you know, first of all in iOS like keyboard support was
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:31.160]  Very rudimentary until iOS 13 like that the API's I mean, I'm sure they had better stuff privately
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:34.040]  But the public API's for it were were pretty rough pretty rudimentary
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:39.240]  And so they I bet like the whole stack of trying to capture the keyboard input was works
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:42.940]  Totally differently on the iOS and doesn't Mac probably and also, you know
[01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:47.960]  That's presumably a part of springboard and springboard was like famously with this massively complex code base
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:52.200]  it does all sorts of stuff and it's apparently been like refactored a whole bunch of times to try to
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:56.040]  Deal with its complexity because it's it's just so big and so complex and so important
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:01.080]  It's so critical to the OS and and so like I can imagine that was probably a harder job than it sounded like
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:06.400]  But you know that being said like, you know, again, it's it's this this whole thing about performance being important or not
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:10.320]  Like, you know, like when you start talking about these difference between like, you know
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:13.480]  A 20 millisecond activity or a 200 millisecond activity or something like that
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:19.160]  It's kind of like death by a thousand cuts like at the time if something takes 200 milliseconds
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:22.680]  That's a pretty frequent interaction that you could make faster
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:25.080]  But it might be a little bit, you know, inconvenient to make it faster
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:28.780]  You know the way things are built at the time you might be able to ship that you might be say
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:31.920]  You know what? We're on a tight deadline. We're trying to ship this in time for the phones or whatever
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:37.480]  We have to get out the door. It just simply isn't important enough to to get that time down right now
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:39.640]  we'll do it later and of course later never comes and
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:45.620]  When you have enough of that in an app or in an OS or in a platform it it really
[01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:52.060]  and I think this is what Craig mom was ultimately getting at like the just overall feeling of software that is built that way or that
[01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:55.140]  Ends up that way is so different and and at no time
[01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:59.800]  Does it ever seem like a critical problem as you're building it and the company responsible for it?
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:06.700]  It might never be economically worthwhile for them to devote the resources to really make it incredibly faster
[01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:13.660]  once it is like quote fast enough to be usable like that, but ultimately it that really does result in like a
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:17.940]  Feeling of like you're just kind of moving through maple syrup, you know
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:21.140]  and to me that's the performance in a lot of ways like that is
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:26.760]  as important as things like input reliability because it's tied to it like like, you know part of the reason why I
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:30.340]  don't like certain things is because like like I think my
[01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:37.900]  Keyboard and mouse and trackpad should be a hundred percent reliable not ninety nine point nine percent reliable like a hundred percent reliable
[01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:44.980]  And if you are operating something and if you're typing a sentence and one out of two hundred key presses doesn't register
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:49.940]  Like that's a really big problem. Actually, it's a small number. I think it could be way higher than that
[01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:53.820]  I mean, I think it could be like one in ten thousand and it would drive you nuts exactly and so
[01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:59.820]  You feel like you're not in control if you write a thousand word article. Yeah, I guess it's probably ten thousand
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:02.580]  Yeah keystrokes, right? Yeah, so like I feel like, you know
[01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:08.380]  if you you feel like you're not in control of your computer when it just randomly fails and with that and
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:13.220]  Performance can give you that impression like if if you are waiting for something to happen
[01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:16.580]  That shouldn't be slow that is being even a little bit slow
[01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:21.900]  It can give you that same feeling of like this wasn't working properly or I'm not in full control over this
[01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:28.220]  One of the features I use a lot and it annoy I love the feature
[01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:32.700]  And I'm so glad it's there but using it every single week
[01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:39.440]  Well, I won't do it this week because I don't need to share notes with you, but I use Apple Notes to share
[01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:44.560]  Show notes with guests on the podcast and then with
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.600]  Caleb who edits
[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:51.940]  And we toss things in there like links that I often forget to post
[01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:54.660]  title ideas and
[01:18:54.660 --> 01:19:01.340]  The interface do you use the the shared notes feature in Apple Notes a little not a lot it it's a
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:05.420]  It's one of those things where I should it would be harder to write about it
[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:08.780]  it's like I kind of would probably be better as like a YouTube video, but
[01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:16.100]  It commits a sort of you know, number one, it's just slow you go up to the share menu and you'd like
[01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:23.520]  You go to share and then a dialogue comes up. It takes way too long for the dialogue to come and again famously
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:28.780]  I know like it as a user of software it is
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:36.880]  Generally frowned upon to tell the developer of any particular software that something should be easy to add
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.440]  Or fix right? Yeah
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:46.120]  You generally take you about a day right explain your problem as politely as you can and let them figure out how easy you know
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:50.200]  How hard could it be but I so I'm not trying to violate that rule
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:54.720]  But it doesn't seem like opening up the sharing dialogue should take a while
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:58.020]  It just takes it just does not seem snappy enough
[01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:00.960]  But then the part that drives me nuts is I always share it by iMessage
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:05.640]  And you hit our message and then the dialog box goes away
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:07.640]  And
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:13.200]  Then the one that lets you type the iMessage comes up oh, yeah and in between
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:16.200]  There is no
[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:22.280]  Spinner there's no HUD. It just looks like it failed. Looks like you hit message and a
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:28.760]  Couple of weeks ago somebody on Twitter dug up like scans of like the original
[01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:34.720]  Apple human interface guidelines from like 1985 or 84 whenever they first published inside Mac and
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:38.720]  It was like like the third page of the interface guidelines
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:43.080]  Specifically said that if if the user has to wait for something show accurate
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:47.640]  you know show as accurate of progress as you can, you know, like ideally show a
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:56.820]  Like a percentage percentage bar type thing, you know the the bar if you can't if it is indeterminate show the watch cursor
[01:20:56.820 --> 01:20:57.240]  You know
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:02.680]  That was the old wait the old deal with wait cursor was the watch cursor and if you used a Mac back then you got
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:06.280]  Used to the watch cursor. Yeah, because it you know, the computers were so slow
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:13.280]  But the watch cursor would appear the second you were waiting on the computer and it disappeared the second
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:19.960]  Moment, it was done with whatever and then it was always very accurate. Like if you got your arrow cursor back
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:21.960]  You knew that it was done
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:28.940]  You know, yeah like talking about spinning hard disk like you'd hit command s in some apps and you'd have to wait for the
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:33.800]  Watch. Oh, yeah. Well, and again, it's like like as back then computers were so so that you had to design for
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:37.360]  Waiting from the start right like every app
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:41.160]  Many features of every app had to be designed right from the beginning
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:44.600]  For like the user was gonna have to wait for some period of time here
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:46.600]  let's make that obvious and clear and everything else and
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:51.800]  Modern like I bet whoever I bet whatever systems are being invoked by the the delay between that
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:55.640]  You know the cloud kit share dialogue and the you know message send from the share sheet
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:59.760]  That it probably is not even built with the assumption. Anybody would ever wait for it
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:04.120]  And so there is no affordance there is we don't even have a weight cursor anymore
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:07.780]  Like we have the beach ball, which is not a good thing. Like that's that's something going wrong
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:10.480]  You know, but we like Mac OS
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:14.480]  I don't think even has a weight cursor now and no modern OS as far as I know it does
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:15.920]  I don't know if Windows it still has the hourglass
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:19.640]  But but like I think we're just we just assume the software doesn't make you wait anymore
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:22.200]  Or if it does it'll show it in a nice way in its UI
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:23.920]  but anyway
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:29.840]  That that dialogue. I mean there's a lot of problems with them. Like I so I don't see it as often in notes
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:34.920]  I do see the same dialogue very frequently in photo sharing and photos. Yeah, and
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:38.360]  It always takes me first of all
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:40.360]  It always takes me at least two tries
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:44.120]  To even bring up the dialogue because I always I can't find where it is
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:50.400]  How do I create a shared note or a photo album and I always get it wrong the first time and then I eventually?
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:55.640]  Figure out which button invokes the invite people thing and it always takes me at least two tries to invite somebody
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:01.160]  Because the link doesn't work or the box just goes away randomly or I thought I invited them
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:08.880]  But I didn't actually invite them or whatever like that whole system is really hard to use and surprisingly inconsistent and surprisingly sloppy
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:15.160]  Yeah, and it's not clear. It's one of those things that they could use some more labels. What is this button?
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:20.400]  You keep pushing over here. It's a mute button. So you as soon as you're done talking you just mute yourself
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:21.520]  Yeah, well, you don't you know
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:24.800]  I'm not like breathing all over you and I can I can take a sip from my cup here without like, you know
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:28.640]  You hearing like the water sloshing around I should probably get one of those. It's pretty great. Yeah
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:34.640]  Well rather it's so it's it's the rolls ms-111. It's it's a totally mediocre mute switch
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:38.800]  It's not great, but I have yet to find anything else that works better
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:42.640]  Yeah, I like I tried like Dan Benjamin recommends this one. I forget what it's called
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:48.240]  it's like the like cough stop or something like that and I tried it and it it every time you push it with a condenser mic
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:53.200]  It you hear a pop sound and this is the only one I found that doesn't but the problem is it doesn't actually mute it
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:56.400]  All the way it only drops like 20 decibels. So if I'm muted
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:03.480]  But but so it's like it's only it's good for like, you know muting like, you know
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:07.680]  The occasional cough or gas or whatever else but you got you don't want to like, you know
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:10.080]  Really yell into it when it's muted because you will be heard
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:11.640]  All
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:17.520]  Right. Let's take one more break here. Thank our third and final sponsor of this midsummer episode of the show
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:19.600]  Squarespace
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:25.960]  Make your next move with Squarespace in your beautiful website somebody, you know needs a nice website
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:28.800]  Do it with Squarespace
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:34.520]  Marco just told the story on ATP. Mm-hmm local establishment. Yep needed a new website
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:40.960]  I made it for them in one night after being quoted $40,000. Yes, which makes sense
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:42.800]  Like, you know, it isn't that they were being ripped off
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:47.400]  Like if you're actually are gonna custom develop something as nice as what Squarespace offers for you know
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:48.480]  20 bucks a month or whatever it is
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:52.200]  Like, you know Squarespace offers a ton of functionality with all their plans
[01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:52.880]  And yeah
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:55.840]  If you go to some some development house and they need to build it
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:58.480]  40 grand is not unreasonable for that amount of functionality
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:00.200]  Good thing is you don't have to do that
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:05.280]  You can just go to Squarespace and have it for a lot less than that. So maybe for you dear listener of the show
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:09.080]  You need a website. It would be great build it with Squarespace. Try it with Squarespace
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:11.940]  Just you know put an hour into it put two hours into it
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:15.880]  but especially I love the angle of
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:23.600]  keeping Squarespace in your mind for when somebody friend family needs a website and you don't want to be on the hook for
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:29.880]  For updating it maintaining it supporting a little that just send them to Squarespace. It's a great price
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:38.360]  Great customer service and no coding required. It is a very very what you see is what you get
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:40.880]  interface that a
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:45.960]  Totally non coder could get in there customize it tweak it
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:50.600]  I get it just the way they like with absolutely no coding experience required at all
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:54.800]  If you do know how to code you can get in there tweak it as much as you want. I
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:58.040]  I'm constantly surprised
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:03.840]  Sometimes you can you can get into the you can get like a login dialog on Squarespace sites by hitting the escape key
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.640]  It's a bit, you know, it's configurable. You don't have to have it on
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:12.280]  But every once in a while like a new restaurant opens in Philly and I'm a nerd, of course
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:16.920]  and I think that's a nice website and I go up to view source and you can look in the headers of the
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:21.400]  HTML and see if it was made with Squarespace or not. It's absolutely amazing
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:28.320]  How many new websites from just and you know, the restaurant business is so so style conscious. There's so everybody, you know
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:31.400]  It's hip nude restaurant is supposed to have a beautiful website
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:35.540]  Where do you go for more Squarespace comm slash talk show?
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:39.320]  Squarespace comm slash talk show when you decide to sign up
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:46.840]  Just remember that code talk show and you get 10% off your first purchase. You could purchase up to a year save 10% Oh
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:51.440]  Anything else what it was? I don't know. What is it going on this summer? Oh
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:54.160]  What about Dropbox?
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:57.160]  Sad I
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:59.380]  So I I you guys had a good
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:03.980]  Segment on this Dropbox fiasco. I haven't gotten the new interface yet
[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:09.600]  I don't know what I don't know what God you have to piss off to get it. But uh,
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:16.800]  It's been it's I thought you had some interesting insight into this that way it when you raise that much venture capital
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:21.440]  You kind of eventually in your valuation is high enough. You've got to suddenly
[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:25.080]  Compete with you're trying to be the next Microsoft, right?
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:27.000]  Like you're like all of a sudden like, you know
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.880]  You you raise that amount of money you you have this kind of business plan in mind
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:35.760]  That basically is like you becoming the next office like the next Microsoft Office or you know
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:39.660]  or the next slack or something and it's like and actually like
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:45.560]  It's really hard to compete with Microsoft Office or with Google Docs or these these like giant
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:50.800]  collaboration platforms and that's what Dropbox is trying to be and ultimately like they're not going to succeed like
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:56.960]  Dropbox is not going to become the next big collaboration platform that's on the level of Microsoft and Google
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:03.560]  they just they're just not like it's it's a really hard market even slack, you know slack is trying on some level and slack is very
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:10.640]  successful in in you know where it is now, but like I don't think slack is trying to be the next like
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:15.240]  It's I don't think they're trying to be the replacement for an entire office suite
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:15.600]  Yeah
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:18.720]  I think they they're doing like their own kind of thing off to the side
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:23.320]  Whereas Dropbox really does seem like they're trying to replace a lot more than what they are
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:30.720]  Both qualified to do and what they are likely to succeed at doing I would I would be surprised if slack came out with a
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:37.500]  File sharing extension that ran on your Mac without you asking for it that shares a folder
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:41.120]  Right. Yeah, like that's out of scope for slack
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:41.340]  Yeah
[01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:43.340]  They're I think one of the keys to slacks
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:48.200]  Success and the way that they're they're very well like people who use slack a lot
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:52.200]  most people seem to really like it and I think one of the reasons is because they're focused and they know exactly
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:54.520]  you what they want to do and
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:29:00.360]  Boy, it's you know Dropbox had that for a while too when it really was just a folder that sinks
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:02.720]  I feel like the like Dropbox is
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:06.440]  Major success as far as I can tell granted
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:08.640]  I haven't looked into this and I haven't had a real job in a long time
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:14.020]  But it seemed like Dropbox is major success was much more on the personal side than on the enterprise side
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:17.880]  and it's a very common need for for like
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:21.600]  You know people to share files with themselves and their friends or a couple of co-workers or something like that
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:23.600]  but like it's it was very much a
[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:26.040]  personal success and
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:29.480]  But you know, it's hard to make money in the personal market
[01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:33.200]  It's especially hard to make big big big money in the personal market
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:34.540]  like if you're gonna raise
[01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:39.540]  You know hundreds of millions of dollars and try to be try to become worth billions of dollars and have like a public stock
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:45.200]  And everything you can't just have could have the consumer market and that be it like unless you're you know
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:48.520]  Unless you are massive and incredibly, you know successful
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:53.720]  But that doesn't really happen that that often like to raise that kind of money and to have those kind of growth goals in this
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:59.440]  Kind of market you need like the big enterprise business accounts and that I think slack was very smart by
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:02.760]  Focusing on business stuff right from the start, you know
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:08.240]  Slack has always been business focused and it has succeeded in businesses up to the up to date, you know up to today
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:10.440]  Seemingly very well
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:12.520]  I mean, I don't know what their financials are and what their goals are
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:15.560]  But it seems like what they set out to do they are doing very well
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:19.160]  And they were you know business focus right from the start and they have you know
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:23.600]  people do use slack for personal stuff also, but they they are very
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:25.960]  They're operating
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:31.360]  Successfully at what they what they're trying to do in business. Whereas Dropbox seemed like it was a really great personal story
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:33.200]  Then they realized oh
[01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:38.320]  We actually want the money from the business or want slash need the money from the business side of this
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:40.900]  So we need to pivot this into more of a business product
[01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:47.940]  but unfortunately they were already so big at that point that both businesses already weren't taking them seriously and
[01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:52.460]  The business software providers were already introducing their own Dropbox like things
[01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:56.020]  So they were already kind of getting Sherlock over there on that end
[01:30:56.020 --> 01:31:02.220]  And then also the personal side of things was not interested in what Dropbox was doing
[01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:07.940]  Like all the stuff Dropbox tried to do to push themselves more into business mostly just pisses off their personal customers
[01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:12.940]  all right, and so I feel like that's why I feel like they're kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place like I
[01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:19.180]  Understand what I understand why they're doing what they're doing given the situation they're in where they've raised all this money
[01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:21.260]  They're trying to become a big business thing
[01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:24.660]  It makes sense to
[01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:30.200]  Do what they're doing now given those conditions the real flaw was getting themselves into those conditions in the first place
[01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:33.700]  Like instead of raising all this money and trying to become something really big
[01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:37.300]  They should have I think they should have stuck with the personal market
[01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:42.300]  But that would have resulted in a smaller company and smaller finances and everything else, but they could have succeeded
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:46.940]  They could have been sustainable doing that and had a really nice business, but that wasn't what they were going for
[01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:49.860]  Right. It's you know
[01:31:50.260 --> 01:31:51.780]  You know
[01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:55.980]  Overcast isn't trying to be the iTunes music store, right?
[01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:59.340]  I know daring fireball isn't trying to be the New York Times, you know
[01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:04.260]  And if we tried we would probably fail right like I have a nice business that supports one employee
[01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:07.120]  Yeah, exactly me. Not that I have anybody else
[01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:11.900]  And that's fine for me. But if I had raised, you know venture capital
[01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:18.580]  Probably probably wouldn't be seen as a good business, right? Exactly. Yeah. Yeah overcast would be a terrible return for VCS as
[01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:24.760]  honestly as many podcasting related ventures are and as as I think the
[01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:30.080]  unfortunate luminary investors are discovering right about now as they
[01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:36.700]  They set a hundred million dollars on fire and to a podcast app. It seems to have no noticeable market share
[01:32:36.860 --> 01:32:38.860]  Yeah, and I haven't heard I
[01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:43.740]  Haven't really heard anything about it. Like they obviously got a decent
[01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:47.020]  initial injection of publicity
[01:32:48.380 --> 01:32:53.380]  based on some of the you know, the names of some of the people who are associated with the star power and
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:55.800]  You know
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:59.680]  People like to write the hot take of hey, here's the next big thing in podcasting
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:05.820]  It's you know, the Netflix of podcasting or something like that. That sounds good. Oh, yeah as a slogan people can write
[01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:09.220]  Whatever articles they want doesn't make it true doesn't make it doesn't actually make it play out that way
[01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:14.100]  Right, like like we all like a lot of the a lot of the press and especially the business press, you know
[01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:15.900]  They know they can tell podcasting is hot
[01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:20.300]  They want some kind of big platform plays to start happening so that both
[01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:22.300]  you know the investor side can make a bunch of money and
[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:27.700]  so that you know, it shakes everything up and gives the press a lot to write about and and that's and that's how other
[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:31.380]  Media have played out so they they kind of expect the same thing to happen
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:37.060]  but the podcast market has shown itself over and over again to not work that way and that you know,
[01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:43.140]  basically the podcast market has a whole lot of inertia behind keeping things pretty much the way they are and
[01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:46.020]  That's the most likely outcome here
[01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:50.420]  So like like you can't you can't try to make a hundred million dollars back in
[01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:56.060]  Podcasting and expect that to succeed very well with pretty much any kind of effort because that isn't the kind of business it is
[01:33:56.060 --> 01:34:02.740]  similar, yes, and so it's like, you know with Dropbox and it's like maybe this whole like, you know folder that sinks between your computers thing
[01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:08.540]  That was mostly for personal use like that's maybe that shouldn't have ever been a billion dollar business
[01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:15.220]  Yeah, and it's different, you know, there's a people have been listening to audio content as long as we've had consumer electronics
[01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:16.740]  You know used to be called radio
[01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:24.340]  But like the radio market was very different simply because you know, like Philadelphia had like two classic rock stations, you know
[01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:29.020]  So if you wanted to listen to classic rock, you'd have two choices in a city of millions
[01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:37.860]  There's not really a market for like a make a lot of money in radio with
[01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:42.420]  40,000 listeners, right? Yeah, you know it or you know
[01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:47.220]  and there might be some stations that only have 40,000 listeners because they're rural or it's truly
[01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:50.700]  Niche programming or something like that, but they're not making
[01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:57.940]  Tens and millions of dollars they're making yeah, they're they're supporting like right a single family or like a small number of families
[01:34:57.940 --> 01:35:00.940]  Like it's not it. You're not good. Yeah, it's not going to become a billion dollar business
[01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:03.420]  Did you see the story? I'm sure you did
[01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:05.300]  I think you did. I think you guys even talked about it
[01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:11.460]  But Bloomberg had a story a couple weeks ago speaking of paid podcasting that Apple is supposedly working on
[01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:19.340]  Backing, you know doing their own luminary type thing. I guess yeah, it was very
[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:25.740]  It was very light on the details. It was very light the actual like meat of the story was basically
[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:29.620]  Some people are saying that Apple is thinking about doing something like this
[01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:38.100]  Which is very much like there's nothing there's not much there there and it definitely fits with the their the story
[01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:42.620]  They've been selling Wall Street for two years about services and I'm not saying it's a bill of goods
[01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:46.220]  They obviously they report the money and the services business is absolutely growing
[01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:48.700]  So I'm not saying that they're that they're not
[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:55.100]  Actually focused on growing services and they had a services event just earlier this year where they've talked about
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:57.900]  you know, the Apple News and Apple Arcade and
[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:03.460]  Obviously the new TV stuff which is, you know, probably the highest profile I
[01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:10.140]  Don't know about podcasts though like and and
[01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:15.500]  Like I and I don't know that it's something they have to do right and I don't know
[01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:17.260]  They have to do right and they already have Apple music
[01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:20.220]  like how many things do they want us to subscribe to and would it be like
[01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:22.940]  you know
[01:36:24.220 --> 01:36:27.260]  If you already have Apple music you get the podcasts for free
[01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:32.940]  But yeah, why music wouldn't it be? Yeah, would it you know, what would it be part of news plus right like
[01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:37.260]  Podcasts don't really fit into any of the other subscription ones, right?
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:41.740]  It's not really music would be the most obvious one or if they ever did do like a big bundle
[01:36:41.740 --> 01:36:46.220]  It would just be one of the many things you'd get from the bundle right when you get the Apple bundle
[01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:50.140]  It would be hard to have it stand on its own. I mean, this is one thing and one of the reasons why
[01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:56.380]  You know, you know Apple's presence in podcasting is massive like they have this huge market share
[01:36:56.380 --> 01:37:02.660]  They run by far the most important and biggest directory that a lot of apps including mine actually search against you know
[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:05.020]  Their their client has you know by far the biggest listenership
[01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:12.380]  Apple is podcasting to a large degree and so for them to try anything like this that like introduces content
[01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:15.900]  That's maybe locked down to them or you know requires a paid subscription
[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:21.660]  Although actually I think one thing that I think Jason Snell brought up is like I think would actually be more damaging to the ecosystem
[01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:23.580]  If it was free
[01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:26.060]  If it was like you could listen to these free podcasts
[01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:31.180]  But only an Apple podcast and not nothing any other apps like mine like that would actually be I think significantly more damaging
[01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:37.340]  But you know ultimately even though they have all this power like I forget whether I've said this on a podcast yet
[01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:41.420]  but like so for years I've been I was noodling the idea in the back of my head of like
[01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:44.640]  Doing a kind of like readability thing for podcasts of like you pay
[01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:47.860]  suppose you'd pay overcast like 20 bucks a month and
[01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:52.940]  I would split it out and pay the podcast you listen to if they participated in this thing
[01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:56.460]  I'd like, you know share revenue share with all of them and I would take like, you know
[01:37:56.460 --> 01:38:02.500]  10% for the running it or whatever and I I talked I ran this idea by a bunch of podcasters a few years ago big and
[01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:03.540]  small
[01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:06.100]  Friends and and you know non friends like so, you know
[01:38:06.100 --> 01:38:11.300]  They wouldn't be too biased and everyone basically said the same thing like no, it isn't worth it because like I guess I would take
[01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:14.780]  Your money, but I would never promote promote it because I have my own method of monetization
[01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:15.180]  I'm you know
[01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:19.420]  I whether they have the listenership or they have memberships or they have private feeds or they do
[01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:22.700]  Patreon I seem to recall telling you this. Yeah
[01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:26.700]  I'm pretty sure you asked me. Yeah, I probably did like I asked every podcast
[01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:28.100]  I knew plus like some of like, you know
[01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:32.100]  The big ones and and they all were very gracious with their time and basically said like yeah
[01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:32.780]  I would take your money
[01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:35.820]  But I wouldn't promote it because I don't want I don't want other people getting the way of me making my money
[01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:38.860]  But anyway, assuming a program like that could exist
[01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:41.100]  think I
[01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:45.500]  So I ran the numbers and I kind of I kind of came to the conclusion that even if I could get everyone to
[01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:48.660]  Do it whatever that like, you know 10% that I would take whatever it would be
[01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:55.180]  it just wouldn't be enough money to make it worth the hassle and overhead of running this kind of program and
[01:38:55.540 --> 01:38:57.860]  Distributing all this money handling everyone's finances
[01:38:57.860 --> 01:39:02.180]  Like that's that it's a lot of burden and it's a lot of messiness and the amount of money
[01:39:02.180 --> 01:39:04.500]  I would likely make from it assuming certain like, you know
[01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:07.060]  Conservative percentages of how many people would want to pay and everything
[01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:12.140]  It just wasn't enough money to make it worth it to me. But as a thought exercise I a few months back
[01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:17.340]  I'd I'd thought like well, I know my market share and I know Apple's market share. So I extrapolated
[01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:22.180]  What would Apple make by running a program like this if they wanted to do something like this where you pay?
[01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:27.940]  Apple some service fee and they split it up kind of like to do with news plus they split it up to the podcast you
[01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:31.020]  Listen to and pay them like if you listen within Apple's app
[01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:36.660]  What if they ran a program like this how much money would they make and I forget the number I came up with but it
[01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:41.940]  Was it was something like a couple of million dollars a year and it's like it just wasn't enough
[01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:47.780]  It doesn't move them like for them. Yeah for them a couple million dollars a year. It would be definitely not worth the
[01:39:47.980 --> 01:39:51.820]  administration of running such a program like the all the costs involved in like
[01:39:52.020 --> 01:39:57.260]  pay in like paying all those podcasters out and dealing with them all and dealing with the signups and dealing with the people and
[01:39:57.260 --> 01:40:01.700]  like the mark having to market this kind of thing to people to get them to buy descriptions in the first place and the
[01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:04.740]  Engineering behind it like it's so much effort to run such a program
[01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:10.300]  Podcasts while they are very while it's a very big market for the content side of things
[01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:13.360]  The platform side of things it's hard to get enough people
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:18.460]  Especially paying people to really make big money as a platform it like
[01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:24.260]  Podcasting simply isn't big enough yet and it may it may never be like, you know
[01:40:24.260 --> 01:40:28.100]  It meant like talk radio a talk radio kind of capped out, you know
[01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:29.800]  Like the talk radio is not still growing
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:34.940]  It kind of capped out at like a natural point where like this is just how many people want this kind of thing and that's it
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:40.900]  Podcasting is still growing but not incredibly quickly. Like maybe maybe it's already capped out
[01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:45.940]  maybe it's maybe it's mostly done growing or maybe it's almost mostly maybe it's almost done growing and
[01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:50.080]  So the even even having their giant market share
[01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:56.960]  Trying to get people to pay for something on a large scale as the platform owner doesn't really pay
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:00.580]  It's not really the math doesn't work out very well for a company that big to have a meaningful
[01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:04.300]  You know pay rate and to make meaningful money from from paid podcast now
[01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:07.860]  It the economic change when you are the content provider
[01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:12.420]  Like if you're trying to do the platform play where you take 10% or 30% of everything, you know
[01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:14.820]  That's it's hard to make enough money there to matter
[01:41:14.820 --> 01:41:20.940]  But if you are making the 70% or the 90% of that then your economics change
[01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:25.540]  So like it does make sense for a lot of individual podcasts to have a paid
[01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:32.220]  You know premium tier where they make most of the money from from their listeners and everything that economics are totally different
[01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:36.780]  That often works out and that's why there aren't so many of those but on the platform side
[01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:41.100]  It doesn't make a ton of sense for them to be like like a pay everyone kind of solution
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:46.720]  but this rumor wasn't about that this rumor was about them making exclusive content and and and you know
[01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:54.540]  presumably tying it behind some kind of paywall and so from that like the the math could work on that for them, but
[01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:59.580]  Again, I think it would be at I think it would be most likely
[01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:03.060]  To be an add-on to Apple music or something not a standalone thing
[01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:10.860]  Well while we're on this topic of podcasts, I know you and I have talked about this before I
[01:42:11.580 --> 01:42:13.300]  find one of the
[01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:15.860]  Strangest things about the podcast ecosystem is
[01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:18.420]  Apple's
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:19.860]  outsized
[01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:23.300]  dominance in market share because they're I
[01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:31.060]  Mean, I mean, I presume you you would actually know this but I presume most people who use Apple podcast listen on
[01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:32.700]  their phone
[01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:37.540]  People certainly use the I'd you know, the Mac versions. I know, you know people definitely use that
[01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:43.520]  But there's this thing called Android which has
[01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:47.700]  greater worldwide market share than the iPhone and yet
[01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:53.220]  even though Google has made some steps you would think that's a business Google would want to be in right like
[01:42:54.020 --> 01:42:55.500]  well
[01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:59.460]  Demographically, I mean, you know, there there are podcast players on Android, right?
[01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:03.260]  Google I think has made three of them so far and they just don't take off. They don't go anywhere
[01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:07.140]  I I think you know what you're seeing here is something that
[01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:12.740]  That you know, I think a lot of people either don't see or don't want to say
[01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:17.340]  But that the Android market is different from the iPhone market demographically speaking
[01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:24.740]  And the the demographics of people who listen to podcasts are significantly tilted towards higher income better educated
[01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:29.780]  More liberal people and those are the opposite demographics that Android tends to be tilted towards
[01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:35.960]  So what you see is even though Android has a larger market share of like devices worldwide
[01:43:36.580 --> 01:43:43.300]  That it isn't so evenly spread or it isn't it's the opposite for podcast listeners podcast listeners so far are
[01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:50.220]  Significantly in favor of iOS. So there's actually there's um, our friends over at Libsyn
[01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:52.220]  Libsyn is a huge podcast who has been around forever
[01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:56.780]  They host tons and tons of podcasts big and small including I believe both of these podcasts, right mine
[01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:59.300]  I'm still on SoundCloud. Oh, geez, you gotta get off SoundCloud
[01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:04.380]  Well, anyway, at least including ATP and I have a lot of I have a lot of accumulated CMS data. Yeah
[01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:09.740]  You really do. Oh god. I can't believe SoundCloud is still hosting podcast anyway
[01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:12.500]  but
[01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:19.600]  But for everyone else who's on Libsyn they they do a podcast called the feed where we're two people from Libsyn
[01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:24.940]  Talk about you know podcast trends and how to and everything and part of that show every month is they share
[01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:33.980]  Data about user agents and what percentage of Libsyn's network-wide downloads are going to you know podcast clients like mine and Apple's and they?
[01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:41.140]  Also break it down by platforms like Android versus iOS and the the Android to iOS ratio has been shrinking over time
[01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:42.900]  It used to a couple of years ago
[01:44:42.900 --> 01:44:45.580]  I think it was like seven or eight to one in favor of iOS
[01:44:45.940 --> 01:44:50.780]  And now it's closer to like three to one or four to one but it's still like that's still you know
[01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:52.220]  iOS to have like, you know
[01:44:52.220 --> 01:44:58.660]  Three to one advantage over Android for for podcast never podcast downloads across this entire network that hosts a huge variety of shows
[01:44:58.660 --> 01:45:01.780]  So it's I think it's probably pretty representative. Yeah, I was a whole yeah
[01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:04.740]  that is
[01:45:05.220 --> 01:45:09.780]  Totally out of whack with the actual market share of those platforms in a hardware sense
[01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:12.620]  You would think it would be more like Chrome and Safari, right? Yeah
[01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:14.820]  It's like like you would think based on androids market share
[01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:18.920]  You would think that Android would outnumber iPhone downloads something like two to one
[01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:24.220]  But instead it's the opposite direction and it's iPhone numbering Android like three to one for podcast download
[01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:28.020]  So it it's very much a demographic difference between those two platforms
[01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:30.460]  And I think that's part of the reason among some others
[01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:36.820]  But that's part of the reason I think why Google has had no meaningful success having their own big podcast app on Android
[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:38.740]  Good
[01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:45.820]  Here's my stats for my show overcast is number one, but our audiences. Yeah our irons is not representative
[01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:54.860]  Three times the market share of Apple core media iPhone, which is listening on the iPhone, but they list iTunes separately
[01:45:54.860 --> 01:45:56.860]  So that's another
[01:45:56.980 --> 01:46:03.380]  Four four percent or so. Yeah, that's desktop iTunes is not meaningful market share most for most podcasts
[01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:10.000]  the only one the only other third-party one pocket casts is about one-fifth the size of
[01:46:11.700 --> 01:46:13.700]  iPhone Apple's iPhone client
[01:46:16.180 --> 01:46:18.740]  Castro's in the top ten. It's a great app
[01:46:19.260 --> 01:46:23.300]  but really that it's all just rounding errors after after iTunes or
[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:29.220]  Apple's podcast app and overcast fun fact according to lives and stats Castro has more market share than luminary
[01:46:29.220 --> 01:46:31.220]  I
[01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:35.400]  Somehow that feels good. It really does actually I'm very happy with that
[01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:42.300]  All right, we got to wrap this up. There's probably the shortest Marco Arman appearance on the talk show in history. Yeah, probably
[01:46:44.220 --> 01:46:45.500]  But I think we're out of stuff
[01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:47.700]  I think we and we got a we have we've
[01:46:47.940 --> 01:46:51.980]  We probably should go to dinner friends and family who are waiting for us to go to dinner. So we should wrap it up
[01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:58.640]  Marco, I'm glad happy to be here. Um, I want to say thank you for inviting me and my family to your home
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:02.580]  And thank you for taking time out of a vacation week to do that to do my show. Yeah
[01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:06.300]  Thanks for having me. There's a lot of fun as usual. I always like it. It's always fun to do a show in person
[01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:08.300]  Oh, yeah, definitely. Oh
[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:11.940]  I guess I should thank our sponsors. Yep, Squarespace
