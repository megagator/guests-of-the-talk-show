[00:00.000 --> 00:03.840]  Rosemary Orchard, welcome to the talk show.
[00:03.840 --> 00:09.760]  I have been a fan of your work written and podcast for so long.
[00:09.760 --> 00:13.240]  I've been meaning to invite you on the show and I'm so happy to have you here.
[00:13.240 --> 00:16.620]  Thank you. That is very flattering and slightly overwhelming.
[00:16.620 --> 00:19.400]  I still remember the first time I met you at WWDC and I'm like,
[00:19.400 --> 00:21.000]  oh my gosh, it's John.
[00:21.000 --> 00:24.160]  Like everyone, it's John and everyone else is just like, yeah, hey dude.
[00:24.160 --> 00:26.280]  How's it going? It's like, okay, nice guy then.
[00:26.280 --> 00:28.240]  Cool. Good. Yeah, thanks for having me.
[00:28.240 --> 00:29.320]  I'm excited to be here.
[00:29.320 --> 00:31.320]  I think I've gotten so much better at that.
[00:31.320 --> 00:32.600]  I do remember meeting you.
[00:32.600 --> 00:33.960]  I hope I was charming.
[00:33.960 --> 00:35.220]  Yes. You're lovely.
[00:35.220 --> 00:41.600]  I used to be in the early days of being recognized, I was catatonic.
[00:41.600 --> 00:44.160]  I didn't anticipate it.
[00:44.160 --> 00:49.480]  I learned a lot from Merlin Mann about how to interact in such situations.
[00:49.480 --> 00:55.020]  I started observing what he did and he's so fantastic when people come up and they're like,
[00:55.020 --> 00:57.680]  hey, Merlin, and he's amazing.
[00:57.680 --> 01:02.240]  I just took notes on what he does and it's been helpful ever since.
[01:02.240 --> 01:05.320]  Before we get into the meat of the show,
[01:05.320 --> 01:09.680]  I have a personal rant I would like to get off my chest.
[01:09.680 --> 01:13.440]  I'm curious. Now, I presume that you,
[01:13.440 --> 01:16.120]  I mean, it's almost more than a presumption.
[01:16.120 --> 01:17.480]  I'd be shocked if this weren't true,
[01:17.480 --> 01:24.480]  but you are an avid user of all three of the major personal computing Apple platforms,
[01:24.480 --> 01:27.920]  the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.
[01:27.920 --> 01:31.480]  What's an iPad? Yeah, I use all of them a lot,
[01:31.480 --> 01:32.960]  possibly more than I should.
[01:32.960 --> 01:35.720]  Maybe I should spend some less time looking at screens,
[01:35.720 --> 01:38.440]  but yeah, I feel like I'm on all of them all day every day.
[01:38.440 --> 01:40.000]  Do you have an iPad Magic Keyboard?
[01:40.000 --> 01:43.760]  I do. The 12.9 inch one has got the Magic Keyboard on it.
[01:43.760 --> 01:46.040]  Yeah, it's generally a fairly good experience.
[01:46.040 --> 01:50.280]  Here's my gripe. I've got one that I bought new.
[01:50.280 --> 01:55.120]  I bought when it first came out, which I think was like April 2020,
[01:55.120 --> 01:59.040]  for my 2018 11-inch iPad Pro,
[01:59.040 --> 02:01.080]  which is still my personal iPad.
[02:01.080 --> 02:06.440]  The iPad for me is without question my third platform.
[02:06.440 --> 02:08.640]  I've mentioned this often,
[02:08.640 --> 02:17.240]  but if a weirdo criminal took me hostage or took my family hostage and said,
[02:17.240 --> 02:20.720]  you have to give up one of Apple's platforms,
[02:20.720 --> 02:25.360]  and otherwise, we're going to do something bad to your family.
[02:25.360 --> 02:27.920]  Instantly, I would just say iPad.
[02:27.920 --> 02:28.160]  Yeah.
[02:28.160 --> 02:29.800]  Or if I got to say Apple Watch,
[02:29.800 --> 02:30.960]  I guess I'd say that first.
[02:30.960 --> 02:33.400]  But I'm saying of the iPhone, iPad, Mac,
[02:33.400 --> 02:34.920]  iPad, I would give up first.
[02:34.920 --> 02:36.840]  But I do use it a lot, right?
[02:36.840 --> 02:39.520]  It's my kitchen computer because I can put it
[02:39.520 --> 02:42.200]  away and it keeps the kitchen looking nice and neat,
[02:42.200 --> 02:43.840]  and then it's got a low small footprint,
[02:43.840 --> 02:45.080]  and then it's upstairs.
[02:45.080 --> 02:51.000]  My office is on ground floor and our main living floor is the second floor.
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.720]  Then it's a nice thing to have on a main living floor.
[02:54.720 --> 02:58.520]  If I need to check something or I want to write a longer email,
[02:58.520 --> 03:00.160]  then I would peck out with my thumbs.
[03:00.160 --> 03:03.000]  My iPad with the Magic Keyboard is right there.
[03:03.000 --> 03:04.440]  Or if I have it disconnected,
[03:04.440 --> 03:09.400]  the Magic Keyboard, I have a drawer where I'm allowed to stash something like that.
[03:09.400 --> 03:13.240]  For a two-year-old $300 keyboard,
[03:13.240 --> 03:16.960]  the wear on mine is extremely disappointing.
[03:16.960 --> 03:20.000]  I've noticed, I don't know if it's rubber or what,
[03:20.000 --> 03:22.560]  but you know how it's got like a coating, like the outside?
[03:22.560 --> 03:23.040]  Yeah.
[03:23.040 --> 03:28.760]  That same coating is between the keys too, right?
[03:28.760 --> 03:30.040]  Yeah, it is. Yeah.
[03:30.040 --> 03:35.080]  So like on the ERT keys on my keyboard,
[03:35.080 --> 03:39.320]  that rubber coating is all frayed between those keys.
[03:39.320 --> 03:43.360]  It's no coincidence that those are three of the most used keys
[03:43.360 --> 03:45.960]  at the very top in the English language.
[03:45.960 --> 03:46.520]  Yeah.
[03:46.520 --> 03:47.520]  So it's not coincidence.
[03:47.520 --> 03:54.160]  But to me, for $300 is very disappointing.
[03:54.160 --> 03:56.760]  Now, here's where it becomes a fresh rant.
[03:56.760 --> 03:58.960]  Today, before we recorded,
[03:58.960 --> 04:04.680]  I posted an item to my website and I had a markdown error.
[04:04.680 --> 04:11.760]  I wanted to link a couple of words to the person's name's Twitter account.
[04:11.760 --> 04:12.240]  Yeah.
[04:12.240 --> 04:15.640]  A friend of the show, John Siracusa,
[04:15.640 --> 04:20.600]  was kind enough to be the first to text me and tell me that, what does he call them?
[04:20.600 --> 04:22.320]  He doesn't call them markdowners.
[04:22.320 --> 04:27.480]  He calls them, he's got a funny name for my markdown typos.
[04:27.480 --> 04:29.560]  I like markdowners personally.
[04:29.560 --> 04:31.120]  I like markdowner.
[04:31.120 --> 04:33.040]  What did he say? I got to look it up now.
[04:33.040 --> 04:35.600]  Markdowner, he calls it.
[04:35.600 --> 04:37.960]  Right. That makes sense too. That's very John.
[04:37.960 --> 04:39.320]  Yeah, it is very John.
[04:39.320 --> 04:40.640]  He calls them markdowners.
[04:40.640 --> 04:45.240]  And I can hear, even when he texts me,
[04:45.240 --> 04:46.840]  I can hear his voice,
[04:46.840 --> 04:51.200]  his sad disappointment in me that I have committed another markdowner.
[04:51.200 --> 04:54.240]  I mean, you of all people, you should be perfect, shouldn't you?
[04:54.240 --> 04:54.880]  I should.
[04:54.880 --> 04:58.720]  Well, he told me when markdown first came out way back when,
[04:58.720 --> 05:04.120]  and he writes Perl, and he saw how I implemented my version of markdown,
[05:04.120 --> 05:07.920]  which is really just a series of regular expression substitutions.
[05:07.920 --> 05:09.560]  Yeah.
[05:09.560 --> 05:12.320]  And he was like, well, that's, you can't really write a parser that way.
[05:12.320 --> 05:16.280]  And I was like, well, I didn't, I'm not calling it a parser.
[05:16.280 --> 05:18.200]  He, I think, he does not use markdown.
[05:18.200 --> 05:21.080]  He writes, he just still writes raw HTML.
[05:21.080 --> 05:25.240]  And I can hear his disappointment because this is why he writes HTML,
[05:25.240 --> 05:26.840]  because he doesn't have markdown errors.
[05:26.840 --> 05:29.200]  But anyway, the error was,
[05:29.200 --> 05:32.360]  what I wanted to write was open square bracket,
[05:32.360 --> 05:35.920]  then the person's name, close square bracket,
[05:35.920 --> 05:40.320]  then a parentheses, the URL, close parentheses, right?
[05:40.320 --> 05:41.960]  Standard markdown.
[05:41.960 --> 05:44.720]  Right, with the link in, right in the paragraph.
[05:44.720 --> 05:47.240]  And what I was missing was the closing square bracket.
[05:47.240 --> 05:49.240]  Yeah, yeah, that sneaky little one.
[05:49.240 --> 05:53.640]  Now, I'm going to reveal a secret here in public for the first time
[05:53.640 --> 05:56.640]  because of the subject of today's show, automation.
[05:56.640 --> 05:58.960]  A little over a year ago.
[05:58.960 --> 06:03.680]  Well, actually, all right, markdown.
[06:03.680 --> 06:06.600]  I started working on markdown in late 2003,
[06:06.600 --> 06:09.560]  and it became public in early 2004.
[06:09.560 --> 06:13.640]  But while I was developing it, I started,
[06:13.640 --> 06:18.280]  once I got it to work, just enough minimum viable product
[06:18.280 --> 06:22.400]  for the developer to use as a plugin and movable type.
[06:22.400 --> 06:25.120]  I had it installed in my instance of movable type
[06:25.120 --> 06:29.720]  for Daring Fireball, and I started writing my articles using it.
[06:29.720 --> 06:34.240]  And it's, in my opinion, it's essential to markdown success
[06:34.240 --> 06:38.920]  because I spent, I don't know if it was four months,
[06:38.920 --> 06:42.080]  four or five months before I even released the public beta
[06:42.080 --> 06:44.120]  where everything I posted to Daring Fireball,
[06:44.120 --> 06:45.880]  I was actually using markdown
[06:45.880 --> 06:49.240]  and then forming opinions of, ah, that's syntax.
[06:49.240 --> 06:51.840]  That looks, that does not look, that looks ugly.
[06:51.840 --> 06:54.920]  Or that's cumbersome, or that's missing,
[06:54.920 --> 06:55.960]  or something.
[06:55.960 --> 06:58.000]  But then I'd make changes,
[06:58.000 --> 07:02.440]  and a lot of those changes were backwards incompatible.
[07:02.440 --> 07:05.880]  And I'd have to go back a month
[07:05.880 --> 07:09.160]  and edit every article to change the syntax.
[07:09.160 --> 07:12.040]  Or then it got to two months, then it got to three months.
[07:12.040 --> 07:14.600]  And then I knew it was getting ready for public beta
[07:14.600 --> 07:17.720]  when I stopped, there no longer were things like that.
[07:17.720 --> 07:20.480]  It was like, hey, this feels pretty stable.
[07:20.480 --> 07:22.160]  Like I'm not coming up with ideas.
[07:22.160 --> 07:27.160]  But then it didn't take long after it, at that point,
[07:27.280 --> 07:30.840]  for me to still, to start making markdowners.
[07:32.840 --> 07:34.680]  I mean, it happens, right?
[07:34.680 --> 07:36.680]  Because you're not changing things anymore.
[07:36.680 --> 07:37.680]  Your brain's like, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[07:37.680 --> 07:38.520]  I know what I'm doing.
[07:38.520 --> 07:40.360]  And so you stop watching what you're doing.
[07:40.360 --> 07:41.960]  And the mistakes creep in.
[07:41.960 --> 07:44.600]  Right, well, and you know, mistakes happen, right?
[07:44.600 --> 07:49.200]  And it's the nature of markdown that like, okay,
[07:49.200 --> 07:50.960]  so if you're writing in a program,
[07:50.960 --> 07:53.560]  if you're writing in a programming language,
[07:53.560 --> 07:55.680]  and it's one of those, let's just say a simple example.
[07:55.680 --> 07:58.720]  Many programming languages required you to put semicolons
[07:58.720 --> 08:00.280]  at the end of every line.
[08:00.280 --> 08:01.120]  Yep.
[08:01.120 --> 08:04.400]  And if you forget to put a semicolon on a line,
[08:04.400 --> 08:08.640]  and then you try to run your script or compiler or program,
[08:08.640 --> 08:11.400]  the compiler will bark at you.
[08:11.400 --> 08:16.400]  And hopefully with an error that figures out
[08:16.400 --> 08:21.400]  that the problem is a missing semicolon on line 41.
[08:21.440 --> 08:22.720]  Yes, hopefully.
[08:22.720 --> 08:26.760]  Or at least point you towards lines 41 or 42,
[08:26.760 --> 08:29.440]  and then you can maybe figure it out yourself.
[08:29.440 --> 08:31.600]  Markdown isn't compiled.
[08:31.600 --> 08:35.480]  It just, maybe some implementations, I don't know,
[08:35.480 --> 08:38.800]  I've never encountered one that will literally refuse
[08:38.800 --> 08:41.400]  to go forward if there's certain classes of errors,
[08:41.400 --> 08:45.080]  but it just makes its best guess as to what you mean.
[08:45.080 --> 08:45.920]  Yeah.
[08:45.920 --> 08:49.120]  That's true, and there's no concept of an error.
[08:49.120 --> 08:51.920]  HTML is similar, and that's what Markdown really is.
[08:51.920 --> 08:54.800]  It's like a preprocessor for HTML.
[08:54.800 --> 08:56.200]  Yeah, makes perfect sense.
[08:56.200 --> 09:00.880]  Right, if you forget to close a tag in HTML,
[09:00.880 --> 09:02.520]  and then you save the file,
[09:02.520 --> 09:03.840]  and you open it in a web browser,
[09:03.840 --> 09:06.160]  the web browser does its best.
[09:06.160 --> 09:08.920]  Yeah, which sometimes is really not great.
[09:08.920 --> 09:09.760]  Right.
[09:09.760 --> 09:11.520]  But sometimes you just end up with,
[09:11.520 --> 09:12.760]  say you've used a pre-tag
[09:12.760 --> 09:14.120]  because you're writing a code block,
[09:14.120 --> 09:18.160]  you just end up with like pre-tag your code,
[09:18.160 --> 09:21.920]  pre-tag like about missing the closing triangular bracket,
[09:21.920 --> 09:24.200]  the greater than sign or something.
[09:24.200 --> 09:28.280]  Right, or speaking of pre-tags, to me, one of the,
[09:28.280 --> 09:29.840]  again, I don't mean to brag about it,
[09:29.840 --> 09:31.720]  but it's kind of popular at this point,
[09:31.720 --> 09:34.040]  but one of the best things about Markdown
[09:34.040 --> 09:37.480]  is how easy it makes to write pre-sections
[09:37.480 --> 09:40.680]  because you don't have to escape anything.
[09:40.680 --> 09:42.600]  Whatever's inside is just there,
[09:42.600 --> 09:44.840]  and the whole, it used to be, for me,
[09:44.840 --> 09:47.360]  it was like the worst part of writing raw HTML
[09:47.360 --> 09:50.600]  is when you wanted to show actual HTML source code
[09:51.960 --> 09:53.560]  in an HTML document.
[09:55.080 --> 09:57.640]  Yeah, yeah, and also, I love the fact
[09:57.640 --> 09:59.400]  that a lot of flavors of Markdown,
[09:59.400 --> 10:01.720]  after you've done those first three backticks,
[10:01.720 --> 10:03.440]  you can just write the language,
[10:03.440 --> 10:06.000]  Python or YAML or whatever it is.
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.000]  Obviously, YAML's another Markdown language,
[10:08.000 --> 10:09.640]  but, or is it called Markup language?
[10:09.640 --> 10:12.120]  It's yet another one, that's the first part, for sure.
[10:12.120 --> 10:13.400]  But yeah, I love the fact that you can do that,
[10:13.400 --> 10:14.920]  and then you get syntax highlighting,
[10:14.920 --> 10:17.520]  which is just a really nice feature.
[10:17.520 --> 10:19.960]  A lovely feature in many Markdown implementations.
[10:19.960 --> 10:24.960]  So I'm talking like at least midway through 2004,
[10:25.560 --> 10:28.400]  six months into Markdown being a public thing,
[10:28.400 --> 10:33.240]  it has been, my reference spec, for lack of a better word,
[10:33.240 --> 10:37.320]  hasn't changed, or at some point in 2004, stabilized,
[10:37.320 --> 10:39.400]  and the Markdown that I personally used
[10:39.400 --> 10:41.960]  didn't get many additions since then,
[10:41.960 --> 10:43.280]  but it didn't take long for me to think,
[10:43.280 --> 10:45.960]  you know what I need next is like a lint script,
[10:45.960 --> 10:47.880]  something like a pre-flight script
[10:47.880 --> 10:49.000]  to look for common errors.
[10:49.000 --> 10:51.040]  Markdown linter.
[10:51.040 --> 10:51.880]  Yes!
[10:51.880 --> 10:52.720]  Yeah.
[10:52.720 --> 10:56.840]  And so, very short, 17 years later, last year,
[10:56.840 --> 11:01.680]  I was feeling inspired early in the summer, and I wrote it.
[11:01.680 --> 11:05.480]  And the breakthrough for me was,
[11:08.280 --> 11:10.440]  and part of what led me to procrastinate
[11:10.440 --> 11:12.520]  for literally close to two decades
[11:12.520 --> 11:15.040]  was that I started thinking about it,
[11:15.040 --> 11:18.640]  and I started thinking that like any proper linter,
[11:18.640 --> 11:22.520]  it should catch as many errors as possible.
[11:23.440 --> 11:26.280]  And that's a really daunting task.
[11:26.280 --> 11:30.880]  And my breakthrough last year was to hell with that.
[11:30.880 --> 11:34.360]  I was so, I didn't write a proper Markdown parser
[11:34.360 --> 11:36.960]  17 years ago when I made Markdown.
[11:36.960 --> 11:38.480]  I just did the thing,
[11:38.480 --> 11:41.080]  the easiest thing I could do to get it to work
[11:41.080 --> 11:43.400]  fast enough for me to be satisfied with it.
[11:43.400 --> 11:46.840]  Why don't I just fix the mistakes I actually make?
[11:46.840 --> 11:48.080]  That's it.
[11:48.080 --> 11:49.960]  And so I started keeping a list
[11:49.960 --> 11:53.040]  of every Markdown-related error
[11:53.040 --> 11:55.640]  that I personally posted during Fireball
[11:55.640 --> 11:57.080]  and wrote a separate script.
[11:57.080 --> 11:59.040]  It's not part of my Markdown PL.
[11:59.040 --> 12:00.240]  It's just a separate script
[12:00.240 --> 12:03.920]  that tries to flag those errors.
[12:03.920 --> 12:04.760]  Yep.
[12:04.760 --> 12:08.360]  And then I wrote like an Apple script for Mars edit.
[12:08.360 --> 12:11.240]  So that, which is what I used to post to during Fireball
[12:11.240 --> 12:12.360]  almost all the time.
[12:13.280 --> 12:17.120]  So that instead of using Mars edit to publish,
[12:17.120 --> 12:20.920]  I run a keyboard Mysore action.
[12:20.920 --> 12:23.400]  And the keyboard Mysore action runs an Apple script.
[12:23.400 --> 12:26.120]  The Apple script gets the body of text
[12:26.120 --> 12:28.440]  from the current Mars edit document,
[12:28.440 --> 12:30.800]  passes it to my Lint script,
[12:30.800 --> 12:32.760]  which is actually written in Perl, of course,
[12:32.760 --> 12:35.320]  cause it's the only shell scripting language
[12:35.320 --> 12:40.040]  my twisted regular expression addled mind
[12:40.040 --> 12:41.440]  can really be productive with.
[12:41.440 --> 12:45.240]  If there's no errors or warnings, let's call them warnings.
[12:45.240 --> 12:46.080]  Yeah.
[12:46.080 --> 12:48.960]  Then it just, then the Apple script tells Mars edit,
[12:48.960 --> 12:52.520]  go ahead and publish and show a little notification,
[12:52.520 --> 12:55.920]  a temporary notification saying Markdown Lint thumbs up,
[12:55.920 --> 12:58.920]  or I think it's actually the green checkbox emoji.
[12:58.920 --> 13:00.960]  And then I know it published.
[13:00.960 --> 13:04.120]  And if there are errors, it tells Mars edit to,
[13:04.120 --> 13:07.520]  it uses Apple script and it shows a simple display alert
[13:07.520 --> 13:10.480]  or display dialogue with a list of the errors.
[13:10.480 --> 13:13.280]  You know, I tend to write my links in Markdown
[13:13.280 --> 13:14.880]  with the reference style,
[13:14.880 --> 13:17.680]  as opposed to the inline links where I'll make a link.
[13:17.680 --> 13:19.840]  And then it's like a foot and like a named footnote.
[13:19.840 --> 13:21.520]  And then somewhere else in the document,
[13:21.520 --> 13:23.840]  you have to use that reference name colon.
[13:23.840 --> 13:26.200]  And then that's where the URL goes.
[13:26.200 --> 13:27.560]  And it'll say something like,
[13:27.560 --> 13:29.560]  let's say I'm linking to your name
[13:29.560 --> 13:32.720]  and I've made the link definition RO,
[13:32.720 --> 13:35.280]  cause that's your initials, Rosemary Orchard.
[13:35.280 --> 13:40.040]  It'll say link definition RO is used, but not defined.
[13:40.040 --> 13:41.040]  And that's it.
[13:41.040 --> 13:43.040]  And it doesn't even tell me what line number it is.
[13:43.040 --> 13:43.880]  I don't need it.
[13:43.880 --> 13:46.360]  Cause I know that's enough for me to find it.
[13:46.360 --> 13:47.720]  Yeah. And fix it.
[13:47.720 --> 13:49.280]  Yeah. That makes perfect sense.
[13:49.280 --> 13:50.120]  Yeah.
[13:50.120 --> 13:51.520]  So here we are a year now.
[13:51.520 --> 13:55.560]  Now, here we are a year later
[13:55.560 --> 13:57.400]  and I still haven't published it.
[13:57.400 --> 13:59.400]  I mean to, but I think by coming public,
[13:59.400 --> 14:00.400]  talking about it with you,
[14:00.400 --> 14:03.120]  this will inspire me to actually publish it soon
[14:03.120 --> 14:04.600]  because it's, I think it's ready.
[14:04.600 --> 14:06.240]  I mean, I don't know how many other people
[14:06.240 --> 14:08.120]  will find it useful, but they might.
[14:08.120 --> 14:08.960]  And-
[14:08.960 --> 14:10.960]  I mean, I'm sure a lot of people will.
[14:10.960 --> 14:12.920]  Markdown, it's one of those things that's very simple,
[14:12.920 --> 14:14.520]  which you would think makes it really easy
[14:14.520 --> 14:16.400]  in the number of people that manage to screw it up
[14:16.400 --> 14:19.760]  on a daily basis because like, for example, your link, okay,
[14:19.760 --> 14:21.280]  you're missing a square closing bracket.
[14:21.280 --> 14:23.600]  Well, you do that and you miss a square opening bracket
[14:23.600 --> 14:25.280]  somewhere else and whoa,
[14:25.280 --> 14:28.440]  some places are just going to look very strange for that.
[14:28.440 --> 14:29.800]  Yeah.
[14:29.800 --> 14:32.040]  Well, that's one thing I know a lot of people do.
[14:32.040 --> 14:35.040]  A lot of people like using Markdown editors
[14:35.040 --> 14:38.040]  that are like split view, left and right.
[14:38.040 --> 14:39.760]  On the left, you're writing your Markdown
[14:39.760 --> 14:42.760]  and on the right, it's a live preview
[14:42.760 --> 14:46.840]  of Markdown processed, rendered into HTML.
[14:46.840 --> 14:49.080]  And I think one reason that most of the world
[14:49.080 --> 14:50.680]  has gotten by for all this time
[14:50.680 --> 14:52.600]  and Markdown grows in popularity
[14:52.600 --> 14:56.160]  without any kind of error checking or a rigid,
[14:56.160 --> 14:58.480]  you can't post if there's any known errors,
[14:58.480 --> 15:00.200]  it'll block you or whatever,
[15:00.200 --> 15:01.440]  is that once you preview it,
[15:01.440 --> 15:03.840]  most of the errors are very obvious, right?
[15:03.840 --> 15:05.440]  Yes, yeah, usually.
[15:05.440 --> 15:07.080]  Yeah, usually.
[15:07.080 --> 15:08.080]  But you have to look at it
[15:08.080 --> 15:10.520]  and I, of course, get lazy and don't do it.
[15:10.520 --> 15:13.040]  But anyway, the reason this error didn't get flagged,
[15:13.040 --> 15:18.040]  I thought, so I had a missing left bracket, right?
[15:19.000 --> 15:19.840]  Right.
[15:19.840 --> 15:22.040]  But I posted that from my iPad in the kitchen
[15:22.040 --> 15:24.080]  while I was having coffee this morning.
[15:24.080 --> 15:25.440]  And so I thought, huh,
[15:25.440 --> 15:28.080]  let me go check if my Lint script catches that.
[15:28.080 --> 15:30.960]  But now when I post from my iPad or my iPhone,
[15:30.960 --> 15:32.800]  I just go right through the web interface
[15:32.800 --> 15:35.040]  in my installation of movable type.
[15:35.040 --> 15:37.200]  So my Lint script doesn't run.
[15:37.200 --> 15:39.180]  I can't think of a way to do that.
[15:39.180 --> 15:43.280]  And I don't post from either of those devices often enough
[15:43.280 --> 15:45.700]  that it's ever bothered me to even try.
[15:45.700 --> 15:48.820]  So I went down to my Mac and lo and behold,
[15:48.820 --> 15:50.720]  it didn't get flagged.
[15:50.720 --> 15:52.080]  And I was like, huh, yeah.
[15:52.080 --> 15:54.720]  So I made a note in my list of other errors
[15:54.720 --> 15:56.340]  I should check for.
[15:56.340 --> 15:58.380]  So it's on the list, I'll add it.
[15:58.380 --> 15:59.220]  But I was like,
[15:59.220 --> 16:00.900]  I wonder why I never made that mistake before.
[16:00.900 --> 16:03.400]  It seems like something I would have done before.
[16:03.400 --> 16:06.280]  And so I fixed it, reposted it, it's up there now.
[16:06.280 --> 16:07.120]  It's fixed.
[16:07.120 --> 16:09.600]  It's the one about the design your own iPhone
[16:09.600 --> 16:12.180]  for anybody who's wondering which recent post of mine.
[16:12.180 --> 16:13.900]  This episode won't air for a couple of days.
[16:13.900 --> 16:16.960]  So anybody listening to this episode, even when it's fresh,
[16:16.960 --> 16:18.000]  it was a couple of days ago,
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.120]  but it's a fun site at neil.fun
[16:20.120 --> 16:24.480]  where you get to make your own goofy iPhone in 3D.
[16:24.480 --> 16:25.480]  It's crazy.
[16:25.480 --> 16:28.800]  Anyway, I went back up to my iPad and I'm still bothered.
[16:28.800 --> 16:31.200]  And I should be furthering myself,
[16:31.200 --> 16:32.920]  throwing myself into my show notes
[16:32.920 --> 16:34.220]  for this episode with you.
[16:35.320 --> 16:37.700]  And I'm like, I wonder why I never made that mistake before.
[16:37.700 --> 16:40.220]  And I'm still chatting with Siracusa.
[16:41.280 --> 16:43.320]  And I thought, huh, I wonder.
[16:43.320 --> 16:47.440]  I tried to type like four closing square brackets.
[16:48.640 --> 16:49.520]  Two of them showed up.
[16:49.520 --> 16:50.600]  Yeah.
[16:50.600 --> 16:53.240]  And I was like, uh-oh, delete, delete.
[16:53.240 --> 16:55.800]  And then I pounded on it like four times,
[16:55.800 --> 16:58.720]  hit the key pretty hard and all four showed up.
[16:58.720 --> 17:02.060]  But when I just sort of gently hit the left square bracket,
[17:02.060 --> 17:04.200]  you got like a low, it seemed-
[17:04.200 --> 17:07.880]  So we've got butterfly magic keyboards
[17:07.880 --> 17:08.980]  is what you're saying.
[17:08.980 --> 17:09.820]  Are they?
[17:09.820 --> 17:10.640]  The butterfly keyboard.
[17:10.640 --> 17:11.840]  I mean, I think they're scissors.
[17:11.840 --> 17:13.300]  I think they're actually scissors,
[17:13.300 --> 17:15.560]  but this is the same problem that a lot of people have
[17:15.560 --> 17:17.020]  with the butterfly keyboards.
[17:17.020 --> 17:20.380]  And I reckon it's that rubber flaking off between the keys
[17:20.380 --> 17:24.240]  and it's just gone under a square bracket key
[17:24.240 --> 17:25.480]  and it's a little bit stuck.
[17:25.480 --> 17:27.920]  Like you might have luck turning it upside down
[17:27.920 --> 17:28.760]  and shaking it.
[17:28.760 --> 17:29.580]  I know.
[17:29.580 --> 17:30.840]  You might not.
[17:30.840 --> 17:35.120]  I do think it does feel slightly stuck too
[17:35.120 --> 17:38.320]  and not in that sickening way
[17:38.320 --> 17:42.800]  where like if you've spilled anything other than water,
[17:42.800 --> 17:44.680]  any kind of like even lightly sugared
[17:44.680 --> 17:48.200]  or juice under a keyboard and you get that sticky,
[17:48.200 --> 17:49.040]  ah, you're screwed.
[17:49.040 --> 17:50.160]  Yeah, that's horrible.
[17:50.160 --> 17:53.400]  It feels slightly stuck, but not in a sticky way,
[17:53.400 --> 17:54.800]  if that makes sense, right?
[17:54.800 --> 17:56.160]  Yeah, like it's slightly,
[17:56.160 --> 17:57.920]  like the resistance is increased
[17:57.920 --> 17:59.160]  when you press on it slightly.
[17:59.160 --> 18:00.000]  Yeah.
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.720]  And it's worse when you hit it towards the top
[18:02.720 --> 18:05.960]  and it seems like my weird style of typing.
[18:05.960 --> 18:10.960]  I don't, I hardly use my pinky fingers when touch typing.
[18:10.960 --> 18:13.940]  I've got like a crazy, terrible,
[18:13.940 --> 18:17.400]  no one should ever learn to type my way style of typing.
[18:17.400 --> 18:21.280]  I tend to hit those bracket keys with my middle finger
[18:21.280 --> 18:22.160]  of my right hand.
[18:22.160 --> 18:25.280]  I just pick my hand up and move them over.
[18:25.280 --> 18:28.400]  It just naturally goes towards the top of that key.
[18:28.400 --> 18:30.760]  Now, the other thing that's weird
[18:30.760 --> 18:33.920]  about the 11-inch Magic Keyboard,
[18:33.920 --> 18:36.480]  and at least on the US layout,
[18:36.480 --> 18:38.640]  what kind of layout do you use on your keyboards?
[18:38.640 --> 18:39.860]  I'm using a British layout,
[18:39.860 --> 18:41.920]  so I've got the taller return key.
[18:41.920 --> 18:44.760]  Right, right, like sort of L-shaped return key, right?
[18:44.760 --> 18:46.180]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:46.180 --> 18:50.380]  On the US Magic Keyboard, at least,
[18:50.380 --> 18:54.020]  the left square bracket is a full-size key.
[18:54.020 --> 18:55.460]  This is on the 11-inch keyboard.
[18:55.460 --> 18:57.940]  Oh, yeah, and then you've got the really narrow one
[18:57.940 --> 18:58.980]  for the right side, haven't you?
[18:58.980 --> 19:02.340]  Right, it's a half-width key
[19:02.340 --> 19:05.500]  because the 11-inch Magic Keyboard
[19:05.500 --> 19:10.080]  has to be a sort of slightly compressed layout,
[19:10.080 --> 19:11.840]  which didn't make sense to me at first
[19:11.840 --> 19:15.100]  because the 11-inch MacBook Air has had a full-size keyboard,
[19:15.100 --> 19:17.140]  but then when you think about the aspect ratio
[19:17.140 --> 19:19.260]  of the screen, it makes sense, right?
[19:19.260 --> 19:21.500]  Well, also the bezel on those things.
[19:21.500 --> 19:22.980]  You can compare the sizes.
[19:22.980 --> 19:25.300]  I've got a friend who's still got an 11-inch MacBook Air,
[19:25.300 --> 19:28.020]  and holding the modern iPad Airs next to it,
[19:28.020 --> 19:31.020]  it's like, wow, these have got the same screen size.
[19:31.020 --> 19:31.860]  Oh, dear.
[19:33.140 --> 19:36.540]  Yeah, the old bezels, the further you go back in time,
[19:36.540 --> 19:38.140]  the more ridiculous the bezels look.
[19:38.140 --> 19:40.180]  Like when you go back and look at the ones
[19:40.180 --> 19:41.580]  that were called Power Books,
[19:41.580 --> 19:43.860]  they look like they're framed for a gallery.
[19:43.860 --> 19:46.260]  They do, they really do.
[19:46.260 --> 19:50.080]  So number one, it's an un-ranted rant.
[19:50.080 --> 19:54.300]  I get out fewer of my things I want to post
[19:54.300 --> 19:55.980]  or even talk about on podcasts.
[19:55.980 --> 19:58.860]  My list of things I want to complain about
[19:58.860 --> 20:00.800]  is always growing faster
[20:00.800 --> 20:03.180]  than my ability to complain about them.
[20:04.300 --> 20:05.780]  Well, that's because your keyboard's
[20:05.780 --> 20:07.580]  looking against you.
[20:07.580 --> 20:10.400]  But ever since 2020, when these came out,
[20:10.400 --> 20:15.400]  I've been bothered by the asymmetry
[20:15.820 --> 20:19.180]  of those two keys being completely different sizes, right?
[20:19.180 --> 20:23.300]  Because they're clearly sibling keys, right?
[20:23.300 --> 20:26.140]  It's open bracket, close bracket.
[20:26.140 --> 20:28.860]  And the curly braces are the shift variants.
[20:28.860 --> 20:30.760]  So even when you shift,
[20:30.760 --> 20:33.980]  the shifted and unshifted versions of those keys
[20:33.980 --> 20:35.880]  are the left and right versions.
[20:35.880 --> 20:40.880]  And so philosophically, they should clearly be the same size.
[20:41.420 --> 20:42.920]  Right, you would think.
[20:42.920 --> 20:45.380]  Right, and if the designers of the keyboard,
[20:45.380 --> 20:47.020]  I realize that if some of the keys
[20:47.020 --> 20:49.780]  have to be smaller than standard size to fit,
[20:50.960 --> 20:52.920]  I realize compromises have to be made.
[20:52.920 --> 20:54.580]  But clearly to me,
[20:54.580 --> 20:58.180]  I can't even see how it was more than a minute of thought
[20:58.180 --> 21:01.120]  that the solution would be for both of those keys
[21:01.120 --> 21:03.180]  to be three quarter size.
[21:03.180 --> 21:06.460]  If you're saying we have room for one and a half keys
[21:06.460 --> 21:10.860]  for the brackets, well then make them both three quarters.
[21:10.860 --> 21:13.300]  Well, do you wanna know the solution to your problem, John?
[21:13.300 --> 21:14.740]  What's the solution?
[21:14.740 --> 21:16.020]  You need to use a British keyboard
[21:16.020 --> 21:18.220]  because I've just checked on the Apple website
[21:18.220 --> 21:21.220]  and the 11 inch, the brackets are the same size there.
[21:21.220 --> 21:23.300]  Like if they managed to get it symmetrical
[21:23.300 --> 21:24.700]  for the square and curly brackets,
[21:24.700 --> 21:27.340]  those are on the same key and also the nine and the zero,
[21:27.340 --> 21:29.960]  you'll be pleased to hear are also the same size.
[21:29.960 --> 21:32.700]  They shrunk the tab key on that row a little bit
[21:32.700 --> 21:34.420]  on the quirky row to make up for the fact
[21:34.420 --> 21:38.060]  that they've got matching sets of brackets and size-wise,
[21:38.060 --> 21:40.100]  but they're all the same size.
[21:40.100 --> 21:43.620]  So just get a British keyboard, that solves all the problems.
[21:43.620 --> 21:44.940]  It might make me happier.
[21:44.940 --> 21:47.480]  Well, but the last thing I'm gonna do at this point in time
[21:47.480 --> 21:50.140]  in 2022 is buy a new iPad keyboard
[21:50.140 --> 21:52.540]  because that's the other conundrum I'm up against.
[21:52.540 --> 21:55.580]  So I guess I'll take to it with an air canister
[21:55.580 --> 21:57.820]  after the show and see if that clears it up,
[21:57.820 --> 22:00.420]  but otherwise I might be in trouble.
[22:00.420 --> 22:02.660]  So two thoughts came to me about the durability.
[22:02.660 --> 22:04.820]  Yes, number one is there's no excuse for it, right?
[22:04.820 --> 22:07.740]  Like it's two year old keyboard that costs $300.
[22:07.740 --> 22:09.620]  The bracket key shouldn't break.
[22:09.620 --> 22:10.460]  Right.
[22:10.460 --> 22:13.380]  But I can't help but think that the one that broke for me
[22:13.380 --> 22:16.280]  is the half size one, not the full size one.
[22:16.280 --> 22:21.280]  And presumably I've pressed both of those keys
[22:21.660 --> 22:23.500]  almost the same number of times.
[22:23.500 --> 22:26.160]  I can't imagine when would I use closing bracket
[22:26.160 --> 22:30.020]  when I haven't previously typed a square bracket, right?
[22:30.020 --> 22:31.580]  Yeah, not on those ones.
[22:31.580 --> 22:32.900]  Like on the regular, you know,
[22:32.900 --> 22:35.260]  on your parentheses brackets, your round brackets,
[22:35.260 --> 22:36.580]  you could be typing colon
[22:36.580 --> 22:38.900]  and then closing round bracket for a smiley face,
[22:38.900 --> 22:41.360]  but which also changes to emoji,
[22:41.360 --> 22:44.700]  but not on square brackets really.
[22:44.700 --> 22:47.420]  Right, the only thing I know about UK keyboards really
[22:47.420 --> 22:50.480]  is the L-shaped return key, which I find charming
[22:50.480 --> 22:54.340]  to be like must have tradition for UK typists.
[22:54.340 --> 22:55.180]  No, I really do.
[22:55.180 --> 22:58.220]  I just think that's such an interesting artifact
[22:58.220 --> 23:00.720]  of how in the world did that happen?
[23:00.720 --> 23:01.560]  I don't know.
[23:01.560 --> 23:02.400]  Yeah.
[23:02.400 --> 23:05.460]  Yeah, it is very strange how both different
[23:05.460 --> 23:06.740]  and similar our keyboards are.
[23:06.740 --> 23:08.460]  And actually the Apple British keyboard
[23:08.460 --> 23:10.260]  is closer to the US Apple keyboard
[23:10.260 --> 23:12.620]  than you would have between say Windows keyboards
[23:12.620 --> 23:14.260]  because the at symbol doesn't move.
[23:14.260 --> 23:18.060]  So the at symbol's on shift two for all Apple devices
[23:18.060 --> 23:20.440]  as far as I know and Windows and Linux,
[23:20.440 --> 23:23.300]  but in the UK and a chunk of Europe,
[23:23.300 --> 23:25.420]  the at symbol is on a shift
[23:25.420 --> 23:29.600]  and then it's the quotation mark key, I believe.
[23:29.600 --> 23:31.580]  And then, so yeah, the quotation marks
[23:31.580 --> 23:35.180]  and the at symbol are swapped on Windows, I think it is.
[23:35.180 --> 23:36.660]  I'm like struggling to remember
[23:36.660 --> 23:37.920]  and I'm looking at the keyboard in front of me,
[23:37.920 --> 23:40.620]  which is not helping because I've got a key cron.
[23:40.620 --> 23:42.620]  And of course that has Mac key caps,
[23:42.620 --> 23:44.200]  even though I've changed the key caps to different ones,
[23:44.200 --> 23:46.880]  I put the right key caps on there because I'm not a monster.
[23:46.880 --> 23:48.900]  I'm using a proper for my Mac layout here.
[23:48.900 --> 23:51.740]  But yeah, it is very strange how we've ended up
[23:51.740 --> 23:55.020]  with such different layouts in some ways
[23:55.020 --> 23:56.980]  and yet so similar in others.
[23:56.980 --> 23:59.800]  So I feel like, well, and the other thing on the UK keyboard
[23:59.800 --> 24:03.360]  are the regular parentheses above the nine and zero?
[24:03.360 --> 24:04.200]  Yeah.
[24:04.200 --> 24:06.180]  Well, then I would guess that the closing one
[24:06.180 --> 24:07.080]  gets hit more often
[24:07.080 --> 24:09.780]  because I think people type zeros more often than nines,
[24:09.780 --> 24:12.380]  like a hundred, a thousand.
[24:12.380 --> 24:15.180]  On the other hand, all stores end their prices with 99.
[24:15.180 --> 24:17.840]  If you get these things to shop managers, then.
[24:17.840 --> 24:20.340]  Well, yeah, so they're probably close.
[24:20.340 --> 24:21.660]  They're probably relatively close,
[24:21.660 --> 24:23.360]  but I would guess with the brackets,
[24:23.360 --> 24:24.940]  it's gotta be really close.
[24:24.940 --> 24:28.340]  I don't think it's a coincidence that the one of mine
[24:28.340 --> 24:32.220]  that seems to be failing is the half-sized one, right?
[24:32.220 --> 24:34.680]  Because it seems like if anyone is going to have
[24:34.680 --> 24:36.460]  a structural problem,
[24:36.460 --> 24:39.140]  it would be the one that's smaller than bigger.
[24:39.140 --> 24:39.980]  Yeah, yeah.
[24:39.980 --> 24:42.140]  It's much more likely to get something stuck in there
[24:42.140 --> 24:44.500]  that's not able to get out as well, I would say.
[24:44.500 --> 24:45.940]  Like that would be my assumption.
[24:45.940 --> 24:47.360]  Yeah, I'm just, I'm trying to remember now
[24:47.360 --> 24:49.540]  what the US layout looks like.
[24:49.540 --> 24:52.620]  And, oh yeah, right, because you've got,
[24:52.620 --> 24:55.540]  so what they've done is they've matched the size
[24:55.540 --> 24:57.260]  of your pipe and backslash key,
[24:57.260 --> 25:00.100]  which we have next to the lower half of our return key.
[25:00.100 --> 25:03.980]  Yeah, oh, like why are those two matched in size, people?
[25:03.980 --> 25:06.620]  Oh, no, I'm not gonna be able to live with this now.
[25:06.620 --> 25:08.620]  I'm never buying a US keyboard again.
[25:08.620 --> 25:10.500]  Anyway, well, the other solution, of course,
[25:10.500 --> 25:14.460]  is to switch from an 11-inch to a 12.9-inch iPad.
[25:14.460 --> 25:17.380]  Yeah, I mean, that is a very good solution.
[25:17.380 --> 25:19.000]  10 out of 10 approve of that.
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.060]  I love my 12.9-inch iPad, honestly.
[25:21.060 --> 25:23.540]  It's a great device, especially when you're using
[25:23.540 --> 25:25.680]  a nice app for writing some markdown
[25:25.680 --> 25:27.800]  and then being able to do proper split screen
[25:27.800 --> 25:31.300]  with two actual apps is very nice and stuff,
[25:31.300 --> 25:33.380]  like the half iPhone preview on the right-hand side.
[25:33.380 --> 25:35.180]  Well, my fingers are crossed,
[25:35.180 --> 25:37.620]  because I don't want to get a 12.9-inch iPad,
[25:37.620 --> 25:41.420]  because I'm a Mac user first, so when I travel,
[25:41.420 --> 25:45.960]  I do take my iPad, but why would I want a 13-inch-ish iPad
[25:45.960 --> 25:49.020]  along with a 13-inch MacBook Pro in the same bag?
[25:49.020 --> 25:50.440]  Use it as a second screen?
[25:50.440 --> 25:54.460]  Anyway, fingers crossed that the next 11-inch iPad
[25:54.460 --> 25:57.740]  Magic Keyboard will have a rejiggered layout
[25:57.740 --> 26:02.740]  that doesn't make, to me, ill-considered decisions
[26:03.580 --> 26:06.620]  about which keys should be half-size and which are full-size.
[26:06.620 --> 26:08.100]  Well, hopefully somebody at Apple
[26:08.100 --> 26:09.220]  who works on the Magic Keyboard
[26:09.220 --> 26:10.420]  is listening to this right now
[26:10.420 --> 26:11.820]  and has just gone and looked at it and gone,
[26:11.820 --> 26:13.220]  wait, how did we do that?
[26:13.220 --> 26:15.100]  I'm just gonna fix that in the next run.
[26:15.100 --> 26:16.340]  Like, it's fine, we've still got time
[26:16.340 --> 26:17.360]  before we put them in boxes.
[26:17.360 --> 26:18.740]  We'll just swap some of these keys over.
[26:18.740 --> 26:19.980]  Right.
[26:19.980 --> 26:22.020]  And before I leave the subject, I'll just say,
[26:22.020 --> 26:26.260]  I am recording this podcast on a 2014 MacBook Pro
[26:26.260 --> 26:30.540]  that was, for many years, my main machine.
[26:30.540 --> 26:33.280]  And even when I wasn't my primary machine,
[26:33.280 --> 26:35.280]  because I had an iMac 5K on my desk,
[26:35.280 --> 26:37.540]  I still used it very much.
[26:37.540 --> 26:40.820]  I have probably used this,
[26:40.820 --> 26:42.560]  I almost certainly used this MacBook
[26:42.560 --> 26:46.620]  more than any Mac portable or Apple portable device
[26:46.620 --> 26:49.380]  I've ever owned, for more years, for more time,
[26:49.380 --> 26:51.660]  and obviously with lots and lots of typing.
[26:51.660 --> 26:54.860]  And the keyboard is still perfect.
[26:54.860 --> 26:57.660]  There's absolutely, there's not a single key
[26:57.660 --> 26:59.780]  that is a little glitchy or,
[26:59.780 --> 27:01.580]  ah, you gotta remember when I type whatever,
[27:01.580 --> 27:03.940]  you know, the E key, that sometimes it's goofy.
[27:03.940 --> 27:06.800]  And obviously with aluminum in between the keys,
[27:06.800 --> 27:09.660]  there's no wear and tear or anything like that.
[27:09.660 --> 27:12.300]  No, the only Mac that I've had a problem with the keyboard
[27:12.300 --> 27:14.060]  was one with that butterfly keyboard,
[27:14.060 --> 27:16.060]  and it was the J key.
[27:16.060 --> 27:18.480]  So sometimes you type a J and you get none.
[27:18.480 --> 27:21.500]  Sometimes you get one and sometimes you get two or three.
[27:21.500 --> 27:24.460]  And that was really annoying, especially.
[27:24.460 --> 27:26.260]  I was on a project when I discovered this
[27:26.260 --> 27:28.140]  that had like three Js in the name.
[27:28.140 --> 27:29.460]  I don't even remember the name of the project.
[27:29.460 --> 27:31.500]  I just remember that there were Js in the name
[27:31.500 --> 27:33.820]  and I couldn't type it on the built-in keyboard
[27:33.820 --> 27:36.380]  half the time, like not without having to go back
[27:36.380 --> 27:37.200]  and correct it.
[27:37.200 --> 27:38.720]  So of course I did the sensible thing
[27:38.720 --> 27:40.760]  and I automated it and added a snippet,
[27:40.760 --> 27:41.740]  so I could just type.
[27:41.740 --> 27:43.700]  I think I went with semicolon LK,
[27:43.700 --> 27:45.300]  because that way I didn't have to touch the J key.
[27:45.300 --> 27:48.580]  Yeah, J would be a problem for me for some obvious reasons.
[27:48.580 --> 27:49.420]  Yeah, I don't know.
[27:49.420 --> 27:51.580]  You just drop it from your name, you'll be fine.
[27:51.580 --> 27:52.580]  But it doesn't matter.
[27:52.580 --> 27:54.860]  Even, you know, what's the least used letter?
[27:54.860 --> 27:56.300]  Z, Q, maybe?
[27:56.300 --> 27:57.120]  I don't know.
[27:57.120 --> 27:57.960]  It doesn't matter.
[27:57.960 --> 28:00.820]  You type all of them enough that you can't have them fail.
[28:00.820 --> 28:03.420]  And it's just ridiculous because keyboard should last,
[28:03.420 --> 28:05.620]  spills aside, something like that.
[28:05.620 --> 28:08.420]  Of course there's the water damage.
[28:08.420 --> 28:10.380]  But just through use, I don't know.
[28:10.380 --> 28:12.340]  It just seems bad for any company
[28:12.340 --> 28:13.660]  and certainly by Apple standards.
[28:13.660 --> 28:18.660]  And again, $300 is a hefty price for a keyboard, right?
[28:19.020 --> 28:21.900]  I mean, there are a lot of people out there in the world
[28:21.900 --> 28:24.080]  who use $300 laptops.
[28:24.080 --> 28:27.220]  The entire laptop is the $500 or something like that.
[28:27.220 --> 28:30.220]  So 300 bucks just to get the keyboard part
[28:30.220 --> 28:33.660]  of using your iPad as a keyboard is a premium price.
[28:33.660 --> 28:35.180]  I'm not saying it's too much,
[28:35.180 --> 28:37.980]  but it's not to be built to last is what I'm saying.
[28:37.980 --> 28:40.700]  Yeah, yeah, like by the time you've got a 12,
[28:40.700 --> 28:43.780]  like a decent size iPad with a bit of storage on it,
[28:43.780 --> 28:45.020]  maybe you've added the cellular
[28:45.020 --> 28:46.220]  when you're looking at the pros,
[28:46.220 --> 28:48.020]  and then you've added that magic keyboard,
[28:48.020 --> 28:50.140]  you're well over the price of some of the Macs,
[28:50.140 --> 28:51.420]  some of the entry-level Macs.
[28:51.420 --> 28:54.620]  So it does feel like it needs to be built
[28:54.620 --> 28:56.340]  to last as long as a Mac.
[28:57.180 --> 28:59.260]  Yeah, that's a very good way to put it, right?
[28:59.260 --> 29:01.900]  Where an iPad Pro plus a magic keyboard
[29:01.900 --> 29:06.220]  is more than a lot of the base MacBook Air configuration.
[29:06.220 --> 29:07.060]  Yep.
[29:07.060 --> 29:08.180]  All right, let me take a break here
[29:08.180 --> 29:11.220]  and thank our first sponsor to our good friends at Collide.
[29:11.220 --> 29:13.660]  K-O-L-I-D-E.
[29:13.660 --> 29:15.620]  If you're listening to the talk show,
[29:15.620 --> 29:18.180]  the odds are good that at some point at work,
[29:18.180 --> 29:19.780]  you're gonna go through an audit
[29:19.780 --> 29:24.580]  like SOC2 or ISO27001.
[29:25.500 --> 29:28.100]  And when you do, you'll have to answer some tough questions
[29:28.100 --> 29:29.620]  about endpoint security.
[29:29.620 --> 29:32.460]  Questions like, do all your company laptops
[29:32.460 --> 29:34.380]  have their disks encrypted?
[29:34.380 --> 29:37.540]  Does everyone have the company's password manager installed?
[29:37.540 --> 29:39.220]  Do you have a system in place to monitor
[29:39.220 --> 29:44.220]  and maintain compliance through your cross-platform fleet?
[29:44.220 --> 29:45.260]  Even if you're confident,
[29:45.260 --> 29:46.900]  the answer to all those questions is yes.
[29:46.900 --> 29:50.900]  The bigger question is, can you prove it to an auditor?
[29:50.900 --> 29:52.420]  If you're not quite sure how you'd go
[29:52.420 --> 29:55.540]  about proving compliance across your fleet of devices,
[29:55.540 --> 29:57.100]  then you need Collide.
[29:57.100 --> 29:59.500]  Collide is an endpoint security tool
[29:59.500 --> 30:02.300]  for Mac, Windows, and Linux devices
[30:02.300 --> 30:05.860]  that does things that MDMs can't
[30:05.860 --> 30:07.820]  and gives you the visibility you need
[30:07.820 --> 30:10.060]  to achieve and maintain compliance.
[30:10.060 --> 30:11.820]  Best of all, Collide doesn't resort
[30:11.820 --> 30:16.540]  to surveilling employees or locking down devices.
[30:16.540 --> 30:18.660]  It's not the sort of thing that employees
[30:18.660 --> 30:20.700]  are gonna be like, oh God, now we have this installed
[30:20.700 --> 30:22.060]  and how do I work around this?
[30:22.060 --> 30:22.900]  What do I do?
[30:22.900 --> 30:24.460]  Can I just use my own personal device
[30:24.460 --> 30:25.300]  or something like that?
[30:25.300 --> 30:27.900]  It does not get in the way.
[30:27.900 --> 30:31.060]  Instead, it works with end users to resolve issues
[30:31.060 --> 30:35.820]  and it relies on their cooperation and informed consent.
[30:35.820 --> 30:38.380]  You can meet your security goals and pass your audit
[30:38.380 --> 30:41.140]  without compromising on privacy for your employees.
[30:41.140 --> 30:44.380]  Visit Collide, that's K-O-L-I-D-E,
[30:44.380 --> 30:49.260]  collide.com slash the talk show to find out how.
[30:49.260 --> 30:51.700]  If you follow that link, they'll hook you up
[30:51.700 --> 30:54.100]  with a goody bag, including a t-shirt,
[30:54.100 --> 30:57.060]  just for activating a free trial.
[30:57.060 --> 31:02.060]  That's collide.com slash the talk show.
[31:03.940 --> 31:06.860]  All right, now, here's the reason I thought
[31:06.860 --> 31:08.900]  it was serendipitous to invite you on the show now.
[31:08.900 --> 31:12.820]  You've got a new edition of Take Control of Shortcuts
[31:12.820 --> 31:14.380]  that is out, the second edition.
[31:14.380 --> 31:16.420]  When did the first edition come out?
[31:16.420 --> 31:19.060]  Oh, now you're asking difficult questions.
[31:19.060 --> 31:20.700]  I didn't do my homework on this.
[31:20.700 --> 31:21.540]  Nobody told me.
[31:23.140 --> 31:24.500]  You could say a while ago.
[31:24.500 --> 31:25.860]  Yeah, it was definitely a while ago.
[31:25.860 --> 31:26.940]  It was a couple of years ago.
[31:26.940 --> 31:28.420]  The first version came out,
[31:28.420 --> 31:30.220]  and so I've been working on it since then.
[31:30.220 --> 31:33.940]  I think it was like December, November, December 2019-ish.
[31:33.940 --> 31:36.420]  Yeah, okay, yeah, that sounds about right.
[31:36.420 --> 31:39.940]  I think this book, number one, I am a huge fan
[31:39.940 --> 31:42.100]  of the whole Take Control series.
[31:42.100 --> 31:47.100]  And you know, it's so funny now that I'm mid-career
[31:48.340 --> 31:49.340]  and I do this sort of thing.
[31:49.340 --> 31:53.580]  I have never written a book, but I know so many
[31:53.580 --> 31:57.380]  of the authors of Take Control books.
[31:57.380 --> 32:00.700]  And I remember when I first started learning computers,
[32:00.700 --> 32:02.140]  especially in college, right?
[32:02.140 --> 32:04.660]  Like high school, I was totally enthusiastic and into it,
[32:04.660 --> 32:07.100]  but it was like, I didn't know you could go
[32:07.100 --> 32:08.940]  to the bookstore and buy computer books.
[32:08.940 --> 32:13.980]  And even if I did back then, like in the late 80s,
[32:13.980 --> 32:16.500]  there were very few that were interesting to me.
[32:16.500 --> 32:19.300]  And then in the 90s, when I got into it,
[32:19.300 --> 32:22.980]  buying O'Reilly books, they were expensive.
[32:22.980 --> 32:25.140]  Like really expensive, but they were also
[32:25.140 --> 32:26.500]  really great books.
[32:26.500 --> 32:29.020]  I remember I'd read a book by a certain author,
[32:29.020 --> 32:30.020]  like Danny Goodman.
[32:30.020 --> 32:31.540]  You remember, have you ever heard of him?
[32:31.540 --> 32:36.020]  He wrote like the first great Apple script book.
[32:36.020 --> 32:38.380]  And then he wrote like an introductory book
[32:38.380 --> 32:41.260]  to this new thing called HTML.
[32:41.260 --> 32:44.100]  Of course, and it's where I learned,
[32:44.100 --> 32:46.060]  and it's why like on Daring Fireball,
[32:46.060 --> 32:49.780]  why I try always like when I'm citing a news article,
[32:49.780 --> 32:52.780]  not to just say the New York Times colon,
[32:52.780 --> 32:54.340]  and then here's a block quote,
[32:54.340 --> 32:59.340]  but such and such reporter reporting for the New York Times
[32:59.660 --> 33:01.420]  because bylines matter.
[33:01.420 --> 33:03.460]  I mean that in news articles.
[33:03.460 --> 33:05.780]  And I think it's especially true for books.
[33:05.780 --> 33:09.060]  And I just, there's a list of programming
[33:09.060 --> 33:12.420]  and computer book authors who I knew
[33:12.420 --> 33:15.100]  and I loved their books and found them very useful.
[33:15.100 --> 33:17.380]  And then would be more likely to buy the next book
[33:17.380 --> 33:18.540]  that the same person wrote.
[33:18.540 --> 33:20.340]  And it never failed me.
[33:20.340 --> 33:22.140]  It's such a privilege for me now
[33:22.140 --> 33:24.660]  that I still consume books like this,
[33:24.660 --> 33:27.380]  but now I know the authors personally.
[33:27.380 --> 33:30.220]  And it is one of my favorite privileges
[33:30.220 --> 33:34.860]  of the bizarre position I occupy in the Apple ecosystem.
[33:34.860 --> 33:36.700]  So the Take Control series, I love.
[33:37.660 --> 33:40.260]  Take Control of Shortcuts in particular though,
[33:40.260 --> 33:45.260]  I think is such a super useful book.
[33:45.260 --> 33:48.300]  Thank you, that was the aim behind it.
[33:48.300 --> 33:49.420]  When I was creating it,
[33:49.420 --> 33:51.100]  a lot of people kind of seen it and gone,
[33:51.100 --> 33:52.260]  okay, well, that's something
[33:52.260 --> 33:53.660]  that's appeared on my iPhone home screen.
[33:53.660 --> 33:55.500]  I don't care about it, delete.
[33:55.500 --> 33:57.500]  Trying to actually make that connection from,
[33:57.500 --> 34:00.660]  hey, there's this funky blue turquoise and pink icon
[34:00.660 --> 34:04.580]  to, hey, there's something really useful that you can do.
[34:04.580 --> 34:07.780]  And you can make Siri better by using this.
[34:07.780 --> 34:11.060]  I think the value of books like this covering,
[34:11.060 --> 34:13.820]  we'll just say shortcuts as the example
[34:13.820 --> 34:18.620]  from A to Z where your book opens
[34:18.620 --> 34:20.940]  with what you would think an introduction
[34:20.940 --> 34:22.660]  to shortcuts would entail.
[34:22.660 --> 34:24.020]  What is it?
[34:24.020 --> 34:25.300]  How do you run them?
[34:25.300 --> 34:26.660]  What's the basic idea?
[34:26.660 --> 34:29.700]  How do you start getting your mind wrapped around it?
[34:29.700 --> 34:32.820]  And then continuing forward to examples
[34:32.820 --> 34:34.460]  then more complex examples.
[34:34.460 --> 34:38.500]  And then by the end, really fascinatingly complex examples
[34:38.500 --> 34:40.900]  that fit within the context of a book.
[34:40.900 --> 34:44.580]  But I think that computer books,
[34:45.620 --> 34:48.740]  even though I said I know people who write them,
[34:48.740 --> 34:53.100]  I do think it's a far smaller industry today
[34:53.100 --> 34:55.900]  than it was 20 years ago.
[34:55.900 --> 34:57.860]  Well, we have Stack Overflow now, right?
[34:57.860 --> 35:00.140]  And Reddit and all of these other places
[35:00.140 --> 35:03.820]  where I don't have to sit down and scan through an index
[35:03.820 --> 35:06.420]  and try and check in a glossary to figure out
[35:06.420 --> 35:08.780]  what words that I'm thinking of
[35:08.780 --> 35:10.460]  might actually be the other word
[35:10.460 --> 35:11.940]  that I should be looking for this with
[35:11.940 --> 35:14.220]  and then go and look at an example
[35:14.220 --> 35:16.580]  and then prop it up on a book stand next to my machine
[35:16.580 --> 35:19.180]  and type it all in to a terminal of some kind
[35:19.180 --> 35:20.660]  and have it printed out on punch cards
[35:20.660 --> 35:22.060]  and then hope that I don't drop them
[35:22.060 --> 35:24.020]  so that they fall out of order and so on.
[35:24.020 --> 35:28.500]  It is, the world has become a much more convenient place
[35:28.500 --> 35:31.900]  in a very good sense of you don't have to do
[35:31.900 --> 35:35.060]  as much work necessarily to find the answer.
[35:35.060 --> 35:36.980]  And then of course, Apple goes and throws us a curve ball
[35:36.980 --> 35:40.580]  by giving everything really difficult to Google names,
[35:40.580 --> 35:43.780]  pages, shortcuts, like all of these things,
[35:43.780 --> 35:46.380]  like do not disturb, like, oh, come on Apple,
[35:46.380 --> 35:48.220]  you could give this a unique name,
[35:48.220 --> 35:50.460]  but no, they're trying to make it really simple.
[35:50.460 --> 35:52.060]  So it's the words that you would think of
[35:52.060 --> 35:54.020]  when you type it into your search
[35:54.020 --> 35:56.180]  so that it comes up, which is great,
[35:56.180 --> 35:58.700]  but also folks, have you heard of an alias, right?
[35:58.700 --> 36:00.060]  You can give something two names
[36:00.060 --> 36:01.980]  so that we can find it under both.
[36:01.980 --> 36:06.980]  And the one in particular, cause I got more into shortcuts
[36:07.300 --> 36:12.180]  last year when it came out for Mac for the obvious reason,
[36:12.180 --> 36:13.780]  like I said, Mac is, and again,
[36:13.780 --> 36:16.380]  if we go back to my analogy about a criminal syndicate
[36:16.380 --> 36:19.180]  holding my family hostage and telling me I can only pick,
[36:19.180 --> 36:21.220]  if they tightened the grip and said,
[36:21.220 --> 36:25.860]  you can only pick one platform, I would pick the Mac
[36:25.860 --> 36:27.860]  because it's the one I work on.
[36:27.860 --> 36:31.180]  And I would cry as I handed over my iPhone
[36:31.180 --> 36:33.940]  and start Googling for what Android phone
[36:33.940 --> 36:36.020]  I should switch to, I would be very upset,
[36:36.020 --> 36:40.180]  but it's the one I work, I use for work,
[36:40.180 --> 36:43.140]  for fun, for data, more hours of the day,
[36:43.140 --> 36:46.780]  it probably is the iPhone, but the Mac is where I work
[36:46.780 --> 36:51.780]  and a lot of the stuff that one automates is work-related,
[36:52.180 --> 36:54.580]  not all, right, and you've got lots of examples
[36:54.580 --> 36:57.180]  in the book of like home automation type stuff,
[36:57.180 --> 37:01.420]  but that problem you said about the Google ability
[37:01.420 --> 37:05.620]  of the word shortcuts is so much, it's even worse with Mac
[37:05.620 --> 37:07.940]  because Mac shortcuts is all about
[37:07.940 --> 37:09.660]  keyboard shortcuts, right?
[37:09.660 --> 37:13.220]  Yep, yep, and very occasionally, like somebody will be like,
[37:13.220 --> 37:15.140]  so how do I put a shortcut on my desktop
[37:15.140 --> 37:16.740]  to open an application?
[37:16.740 --> 37:19.660]  Oh, you've just switched from Windows, hi, welcome,
[37:19.660 --> 37:22.940]  this is not how we do things over here, welcome to the dock.
[37:22.940 --> 37:24.860]  Yeah, it's so difficult, so difficult,
[37:24.860 --> 37:28.140]  like even searching on Apple's website sometimes
[37:28.140 --> 37:30.340]  doesn't get you the results that you're looking for.
[37:30.340 --> 37:32.580]  Their help section for shortcuts is pretty great,
[37:32.580 --> 37:35.180]  but you have to find that, otherwise it's sending you down
[37:35.180 --> 37:37.540]  like keyboard shortcuts for GarageBand.
[37:37.540 --> 37:41.060]  Right, and I know search engine optimization
[37:41.060 --> 37:46.060]  gets a bad name as a racket of how do you cheat your way
[37:46.600 --> 37:49.660]  to the top of search results for a certain term,
[37:50.660 --> 37:52.660]  but at the opposite end of the spectrum,
[37:52.660 --> 37:56.380]  when all, you have no intention, like if you're Apple
[37:56.380 --> 37:59.380]  and you're creating a new technology
[37:59.380 --> 38:01.140]  and all you want is for people,
[38:01.140 --> 38:02.700]  if they want to learn more about it,
[38:02.700 --> 38:04.780]  to be able to learn more about it,
[38:04.780 --> 38:08.060]  you're not trying to trick DuckDuckGo and Google
[38:08.060 --> 38:10.840]  and Bing into giving you higher results
[38:10.840 --> 38:12.780]  that you don't really deserve.
[38:12.780 --> 38:17.780]  Giving your thing a unique name has, still,
[38:17.780 --> 38:20.360]  and it probably always will have tremendous value.
[38:20.360 --> 38:24.620]  So for example, AppleScript, all one word.
[38:24.620 --> 38:27.300]  If you type AppleScript something,
[38:27.300 --> 38:29.580]  you're gonna get results about AppleScript something.
[38:29.580 --> 38:31.420]  They may not solve your problem, but-
[38:31.420 --> 38:33.180]  It's gonna point you in the right direction, right,
[38:33.180 --> 38:35.460]  and give you a chunk of a script that you can copy and paste
[38:35.460 --> 38:38.140]  and go stick together with a bunch of other things.
[38:38.140 --> 38:40.420]  Right, shortcuts is really difficult.
[38:40.420 --> 38:44.660]  It is not a bad name descriptive-wise, right?
[38:44.660 --> 38:48.460]  They are shortcuts, but you're exactly right, though,
[38:48.460 --> 38:50.500]  that it's, and my complaint
[38:50.500 --> 38:55.500]  that computer books have declined in prominence
[38:58.140 --> 39:00.620]  and therefore a lot of publishers have closed.
[39:00.620 --> 39:02.400]  I mean, it all makes sense.
[39:02.400 --> 39:04.100]  I'm not arguing that it really
[39:04.100 --> 39:05.720]  could have turned out another way.
[39:05.720 --> 39:08.860]  I think you are, you put your finger exactly
[39:08.860 --> 39:11.740]  on probably the top two sites
[39:11.740 --> 39:16.740]  that have alleviated the need for books in a lot of cases.
[39:16.740 --> 39:20.380]  Stack Overflow, for sure, for programming
[39:20.380 --> 39:23.160]  or this type of thing, and Reddit.
[39:23.160 --> 39:28.160]  There is also the problem of the bad form of SEO
[39:28.460 --> 39:32.820]  and content farms, these sites.
[39:32.820 --> 39:37.100]  It is sort of, this is why we can't have nice things, right?
[39:37.100 --> 39:38.020]  Yeah, yeah.
[39:38.020 --> 39:41.760]  The internet is amazing, and it really,
[39:41.760 --> 39:44.760]  it's unbelievable how much of this information
[39:44.760 --> 39:46.700]  is out there, just freely accessible.
[39:46.700 --> 39:48.980]  And you could just search in a simple little box
[39:48.980 --> 39:52.540]  without a complicated query language.
[39:52.540 --> 39:56.100]  You just type plain language and hit the return key,
[39:56.100 --> 39:59.240]  however shaped your return key is, and you can find it.
[39:59.240 --> 40:02.840]  But for programming topics, and it's true
[40:02.840 --> 40:05.180]  for lots of commonly searched-for things,
[40:05.180 --> 40:09.580]  health topics, for sure, but like programming topics,
[40:09.580 --> 40:11.540]  there are so many sites out there
[40:11.540 --> 40:14.940]  that are just there to get,
[40:14.940 --> 40:19.820]  if your question is how do you split standard in
[40:19.820 --> 40:23.180]  from standard out or standard error in a shell script
[40:23.180 --> 40:26.860]  or something like that, you get these top results
[40:26.860 --> 40:30.140]  that are these sites, and they might have the answer,
[40:30.140 --> 40:33.220]  but there is something so icky
[40:33.220 --> 40:35.260]  about the way they're written.
[40:35.260 --> 40:36.500]  Yep, yeah.
[40:36.500 --> 40:38.740]  If you get lucky when you're searching for things like that,
[40:38.740 --> 40:41.460]  you'll get Linode and DigitalOcean
[40:41.460 --> 40:44.380]  and some of the other folks who are doing server hosting
[40:44.380 --> 40:46.780]  and so on who've written their own articles
[40:46.780 --> 40:49.340]  to take advantage of the fact that this is a space
[40:49.340 --> 40:52.260]  where people need guides from a company they can trust,
[40:52.260 --> 40:54.720]  and those are pretty high up in the results,
[40:54.720 --> 40:56.460]  but they're not as high up in the results
[40:56.460 --> 40:58.820]  as that place that basically scrapes Stack Overflow
[40:58.820 --> 41:01.020]  and dumps it into a thing full of ads
[41:01.020 --> 41:03.480]  and highlights different keywords so that you click on it
[41:03.480 --> 41:05.180]  after you clicked on the Stack Overflow one
[41:05.180 --> 41:07.660]  and it didn't answer your question, thinking that it might.
[41:07.660 --> 41:10.660]  Right, and it's a total game of whack-a-mole
[41:10.660 --> 41:14.140]  where those content forums are constantly trying
[41:14.140 --> 41:16.140]  to stay atop paying people
[41:16.140 --> 41:18.460]  not to write good articles, right?
[41:18.460 --> 41:21.860]  What you'd want, it would be like back in the day,
[41:21.860 --> 41:25.860]  O'Reilly, which I said was a great publisher of books,
[41:25.860 --> 41:27.460]  but they had a great website too
[41:27.460 --> 41:29.420]  where they would pay often the same authors
[41:29.420 --> 41:31.460]  who wrote their books to write articles,
[41:31.460 --> 41:34.860]  and instead of doing what I think is clearly the right thing
[41:34.860 --> 41:39.660]  and finding really talented, enthusiastic writers
[41:39.660 --> 41:44.660]  who have a natural pedagogical ability.
[41:45.380 --> 41:48.180]  They're natural-born writers and teachers,
[41:48.180 --> 41:51.240]  and they're good at explaining things.
[41:51.240 --> 41:53.380]  Oh, and then you read something from a good author
[41:53.380 --> 41:54.500]  and you're like, oh, I get it now.
[41:54.500 --> 41:55.860]  That's a great way to put it.
[41:55.860 --> 41:58.100]  Now this thing that was confusing, I get.
[41:58.100 --> 42:01.300]  Instead, the content forums aren't paying
[42:01.300 --> 42:04.380]  talented programmers or authors.
[42:04.380 --> 42:08.420]  They're paying just people to figure out
[42:08.420 --> 42:12.420]  how do we keep our thing about JavaScript printing
[42:12.420 --> 42:17.420]  to the console in the top two of Google's results,
[42:17.620 --> 42:18.460]  whether it's the-
[42:18.460 --> 42:20.500]  Yeah, they're looking for the minimum viable product, right,
[42:20.500 --> 42:22.620]  rather than the best possible solution.
[42:22.620 --> 42:25.940]  Right, and it's one of those weird ways that,
[42:25.940 --> 42:28.500]  and this is not even getting into the complaints
[42:28.500 --> 42:31.140]  people have about Google with the number of ads
[42:31.140 --> 42:32.500]  they put in their search results
[42:32.500 --> 42:37.220]  and preferencing their own internal content,
[42:37.220 --> 42:38.680]  like when you type in a restaurant name
[42:38.680 --> 42:39.740]  and they just show you their,
[42:39.740 --> 42:42.120]  instead of taking it to the restaurant's website
[42:42.120 --> 42:45.060]  as the number one hit, the top thing is their own card
[42:45.060 --> 42:46.980]  for it, which that's a separate discussion.
[42:46.980 --> 42:50.120]  Just the parts of Google and all the other search engines
[42:50.120 --> 42:52.780]  like DuckDuckGo and Bing and where they're just trying
[42:52.780 --> 42:56.460]  to surface the best results, it's gotten worse
[42:56.460 --> 43:00.100]  since like 15, 20 years ago,
[43:00.100 --> 43:04.580]  because like 15, 20 years ago,
[43:04.580 --> 43:09.460]  the results were all from like people's actual blogs, right?
[43:09.460 --> 43:10.300]  Yeah.
[43:10.300 --> 43:14.260]  Or something like O'Reilly.net or O'ReillyNet.com,
[43:14.260 --> 43:15.580]  whatever their website used to be,
[43:15.580 --> 43:17.380]  but real things that were only published
[43:17.380 --> 43:20.460]  just to help readers and written for readers first,
[43:20.460 --> 43:22.420]  not written for the search engine first.
[43:22.420 --> 43:23.420]  Yeah, definitely.
[43:23.420 --> 43:27.740]  I think the other thing that we are perhaps struggling with
[43:27.740 --> 43:32.660]  is there is a trend towards video for explanation.
[43:32.660 --> 43:34.860]  And I know a picture is worth a thousand words
[43:34.860 --> 43:37.020]  and if I'm sending somebody a bug report,
[43:37.020 --> 43:39.100]  like if I'm on one of the Omni group,
[43:39.100 --> 43:40.860]  they've got some betas running at the moment
[43:40.860 --> 43:42.760]  and if I run into a bug on one of those,
[43:42.760 --> 43:44.620]  I'm gonna send their support, a description of it,
[43:44.620 --> 43:46.020]  some screenshots and a video,
[43:46.020 --> 43:47.860]  because then they can see exactly where I've gone
[43:47.860 --> 43:49.820]  and what I've run into and what I was trying to do
[43:49.820 --> 43:52.120]  and was I holding it wrong or is it something
[43:52.120 --> 43:54.020]  that they need to work on their side?
[43:54.020 --> 43:55.620]  It's really helpful.
[43:55.620 --> 43:58.100]  But I think the other problem that you have with video
[43:58.100 --> 44:01.340]  is it's not easily to get it into the search rankings.
[44:01.340 --> 44:03.340]  Like if you go search for something on YouTube,
[44:03.340 --> 44:05.940]  you're gonna find the results that you're looking for,
[44:05.940 --> 44:08.340]  but also it goes out of date very quickly
[44:08.340 --> 44:12.780]  and it's very difficult to just update part of a video
[44:12.780 --> 44:15.220]  to be more modern.
[44:15.220 --> 44:17.020]  Like I've seen this with Home Assistant.
[44:17.020 --> 44:18.820]  There's a lot of great creators out there.
[44:18.820 --> 44:20.380]  They've got a whole creative network actually
[44:20.380 --> 44:23.060]  that they recently launched and they're making videos
[44:23.060 --> 44:26.100]  and they're great, they're really great videos
[44:26.100 --> 44:28.540]  until something significant changes in the UI
[44:28.540 --> 44:29.640]  a couple of months down the line,
[44:29.640 --> 44:32.100]  at which point all the videos created before then
[44:32.100 --> 44:34.620]  kind of need a translation filter over the top of them.
[44:34.620 --> 44:37.820]  And the closest I've seen to somebody updating videos
[44:37.820 --> 44:41.340]  and doing it well was actually Symphony, the PHP framework.
[44:41.340 --> 44:43.100]  They have their own video platform
[44:43.100 --> 44:45.200]  for tutorials called Symphony Casts.
[44:45.200 --> 44:47.780]  And what they have underneath is they've got a transcript
[44:47.780 --> 44:50.380]  of every video with code blocks that you can copy.
[44:50.380 --> 44:51.740]  And if something's changed,
[44:51.740 --> 44:53.740]  then they edit it in the transcript
[44:53.740 --> 44:56.700]  and they add like a note that flushes up on screen of,
[44:56.700 --> 45:00.700]  hey, this has changed in XYZ version, see below.
[45:00.700 --> 45:02.100]  And then you can scroll down,
[45:02.100 --> 45:03.620]  you can click on the area of the transcript
[45:03.620 --> 45:05.300]  and they'll fast forward you to that point in the video
[45:05.300 --> 45:07.260]  or whatever, they do a little drop-in.
[45:07.260 --> 45:09.200]  But it's very difficult to update video,
[45:09.200 --> 45:11.100]  but video is incredibly popular
[45:11.100 --> 45:13.340]  to the point where I was installing a new smart lock
[45:13.340 --> 45:16.060]  and the paper instructions were awful.
[45:16.060 --> 45:17.820]  I had to watch the video.
[45:17.820 --> 45:20.020]  I had to watch the video like five or six times.
[45:20.020 --> 45:22.700]  If I'd had some actual like, I don't know,
[45:22.700 --> 45:26.120]  like rough drawings and some arrows on the drawings,
[45:26.120 --> 45:27.700]  then I would have been able to do the entire thing
[45:27.700 --> 45:29.740]  about 60,000 times faster, I feel.
[45:29.740 --> 45:31.900]  But instead I was sitting there watching a video
[45:31.900 --> 45:33.900]  on like a 50-inch television going,
[45:33.900 --> 45:35.260]  wait, what did they just do there?
[45:35.260 --> 45:36.420]  I need to be able to zoom in.
[45:36.420 --> 45:38.380]  How do I zoom in on a 50-inch TV?
[45:38.380 --> 45:40.500]  Like, do I just have to go and sit like with my nose
[45:40.500 --> 45:42.300]  to the TV, pressed against it?
[45:42.300 --> 45:45.940]  Oh, yeah, not an optimal experience in that particular case.
[45:45.940 --> 45:48.220]  Yeah, I can't think of one off the top of my head,
[45:48.220 --> 45:49.540]  but I've had things like that too,
[45:49.540 --> 45:52.740]  where I've bought a gadget and you open it,
[45:52.740 --> 45:54.160]  like, all right, now how do I set this up?
[45:54.160 --> 45:56.940]  And it's like, here's how you set this up.
[45:56.940 --> 45:58.460]  This is the instruction packet.
[45:58.460 --> 46:00.540]  Point your phone at this QR code.
[46:00.540 --> 46:03.220]  Yep, yep, yep, like, if you're very lucky,
[46:03.220 --> 46:04.740]  tap your phone to the NFC tag.
[46:04.740 --> 46:07.340]  Right, and then the QR code just takes you
[46:07.340 --> 46:09.540]  to a YouTube video where somebody from the company
[46:09.540 --> 46:10.580]  explains what to do.
[46:10.580 --> 46:12.940]  But it's like, this seems like something
[46:12.940 --> 46:15.460]  that it should be like an Ikea product,
[46:15.460 --> 46:18.340]  where there's like three little drawings
[46:18.340 --> 46:21.140]  and they tell you, oh, first drawing like this,
[46:21.140 --> 46:23.980]  second drawing, third drawing, okay, now you're done.
[46:23.980 --> 46:27.620]  And it's like, like, imagine putting together a Lego kit
[46:27.620 --> 46:29.660]  where if instead of giving you the instructions,
[46:29.660 --> 46:32.300]  they're like, just watch this video, it would drive you nuts.
[46:32.300 --> 46:35.520]  Yeah, and it's just very difficult as well,
[46:35.520 --> 46:39.740]  because if you know that the answer is like on step three,
[46:39.740 --> 46:41.900]  then you have to know the timestamp in the video,
[46:41.900 --> 46:43.260]  unless they've been good,
[46:43.260 --> 46:46.160]  unless the creator has been able to add timestamps.
[46:46.160 --> 46:48.380]  But yeah, like, it's really difficult.
[46:48.380 --> 46:50.960]  And when it goes out of date, it's just so sad,
[46:50.960 --> 46:54.700]  because it's like, to update it is record a new video.
[46:54.700 --> 46:56.940]  And having done some video production, I can tell you,
[46:56.940 --> 46:59.460]  it's not easy to just go record a new video.
[46:59.460 --> 47:00.460]  It can be quite difficult.
[47:00.460 --> 47:04.920]  Right, because I am not Mr. Video, as everybody knows,
[47:04.920 --> 47:06.460]  but I've done it enough.
[47:06.460 --> 47:08.820]  Even like years on my YouTube channel,
[47:08.820 --> 47:11.300]  I've only got like, almost everything on my YouTube channel
[47:11.300 --> 47:14.460]  are live versions of the show from WWDC.
[47:14.460 --> 47:16.840]  But a couple of years ago, when AirPods were new,
[47:16.840 --> 47:19.140]  I put a video out, I'll put it in the show notes,
[47:19.140 --> 47:21.980]  I swear to God, how to take your AirPods out of the case,
[47:21.980 --> 47:24.980]  because the natural way to do it is try to pinch them,
[47:24.980 --> 47:27.180]  but you can't, because they're sort of round.
[47:27.180 --> 47:29.440]  And if you just sort of push them out from the middle
[47:29.440 --> 47:31.260]  towards the outside, they pop right out.
[47:31.260 --> 47:33.220]  And it's, to me, it's better,
[47:33.220 --> 47:34.860]  that whole problem has gotten better with iPads.
[47:34.860 --> 47:37.860]  But anyway, I made a little YouTube video just for fun.
[47:37.860 --> 47:39.900]  And it took me so long to shoot.
[47:39.900 --> 47:42.740]  And I know that people who are professional YouTubers
[47:42.740 --> 47:45.280]  or even semi-professional and do it more regularly,
[47:45.280 --> 47:47.020]  keep a setup ready to go.
[47:47.020 --> 47:50.660]  You've got lights and a table or you've got a staging area.
[47:50.660 --> 47:52.620]  You don't have to create your studio,
[47:52.620 --> 47:56.880]  however much your studio is in quotes.
[47:56.880 --> 47:58.580]  I get it that if you do it regularly,
[47:58.580 --> 48:00.060]  you keep your studio set up.
[48:00.060 --> 48:02.740]  But if you're going to appear on the video,
[48:02.740 --> 48:05.820]  you wanna get a shower and do your hair right
[48:05.820 --> 48:09.580]  and put a clean shirt on, it's a lot.
[48:09.580 --> 48:14.580]  Especially if you just need to update 5% in the middle
[48:14.580 --> 48:17.940]  for this new thing in the OS or something like that.
[48:17.940 --> 48:21.820]  I don't know how commonly known it is out there.
[48:21.820 --> 48:24.540]  I know amongst people who create stuff, everybody knows.
[48:24.540 --> 48:28.060]  But YouTube doesn't let you replace a video.
[48:28.060 --> 48:32.860]  So if you put out an hour-long video
[48:32.860 --> 48:35.660]  and then you find out that there's a name spelled wrong
[48:35.660 --> 48:39.600]  in the credits, but the video's already been published,
[48:40.560 --> 48:42.740]  your only option is to delete it
[48:42.740 --> 48:46.420]  and replace it with a new video and it gets a new URL.
[48:46.420 --> 48:48.420]  So if you catch it right away, okay.
[48:48.420 --> 48:51.060]  But once you've got lots and lots of views on it,
[48:51.060 --> 48:53.500]  you wanna keep the views because keeping views
[48:53.500 --> 48:55.780]  is how you build your reputation on YouTube.
[48:55.780 --> 48:58.660]  It's understandable why they do that, I guess,
[48:58.660 --> 49:00.320]  because what would happen otherwise,
[49:00.320 --> 49:02.940]  I mean, you can think of all sorts of other nefarious ways
[49:02.940 --> 49:04.440]  that this could go wrong.
[49:04.440 --> 49:06.500]  But if you could just replace it willy-nilly,
[49:06.500 --> 49:09.740]  people could, well, number one,
[49:09.740 --> 49:11.140]  there'd be a whole industry of people
[49:11.140 --> 49:14.540]  looking for popular videos, like evergreen popular videos,
[49:14.540 --> 49:17.660]  and wanting to buy it and replace it with our spam.
[49:17.660 --> 49:20.300]  So I get why, but it's incredibly frustrating,
[49:20.300 --> 49:22.660]  especially for me coming from the world where,
[49:22.660 --> 49:24.260]  well, podcasts I don't go back and fix,
[49:24.260 --> 49:25.620]  but podcasts are ephemeral.
[49:25.620 --> 49:29.700]  But for all my writing, if I have a typo, I could fix it.
[49:29.700 --> 49:31.980]  Or if it's a 10-year-old article
[49:31.980 --> 49:34.300]  about something in AppleScript,
[49:34.300 --> 49:37.380]  but something changes in the syntax of the AppleScript,
[49:37.380 --> 49:39.660]  I could just go back to that 10-year-old article
[49:39.660 --> 49:41.380]  and either just fix it,
[49:41.380 --> 49:44.020]  just change it without a note or change it and add a note
[49:44.020 --> 49:47.700]  and say, hey, I updated this in August of 2022
[49:47.700 --> 49:49.300]  because this changed.
[49:49.300 --> 49:51.780]  Like that's built into the RSS specification,
[49:51.780 --> 49:55.660]  the updated date, like it's very common in so many places
[49:55.660 --> 49:59.380]  to have an updated at date or modified on date.
[49:59.380 --> 50:02.220]  Files have got it in our protein system,
[50:02.220 --> 50:04.900]  but somehow yet not YouTube videos.
[50:04.900 --> 50:08.180]  Right, so the videos is an interesting idea.
[50:08.180 --> 50:09.340]  I still feel the drive,
[50:09.340 --> 50:12.220]  even though I'm settled in at Daring Fireball
[50:12.220 --> 50:14.380]  with my website and this talk show,
[50:14.380 --> 50:18.540]  I still have the drive to create new stuff
[50:18.540 --> 50:21.300]  and have it be read and listened to.
[50:21.300 --> 50:24.660]  And it is still a thrill for me to do that.
[50:24.660 --> 50:26.300]  And so I totally get why,
[50:26.300 --> 50:29.500]  I remember when I was getting started having that drive,
[50:29.500 --> 50:30.980]  it just seems to me that so many people
[50:30.980 --> 50:33.740]  who are getting started go to video first now.
[50:33.740 --> 50:38.740]  And I'm not quite sure if that's just because being on TV
[50:38.740 --> 50:40.380]  was always the big deal, right?
[50:40.380 --> 50:42.980]  Like when I was a kid before the internet,
[50:42.980 --> 50:45.140]  you know, if you asked a class of students,
[50:45.140 --> 50:47.620]  what would you rather grow up to be?
[50:47.620 --> 50:49.260]  Would you rather be on TV
[50:49.260 --> 50:53.180]  or would you rather have be the author of books?
[50:53.180 --> 50:55.380]  Almost every kid was, even me,
[50:55.380 --> 50:57.420]  I might've even as a kid raised my hand
[50:57.420 --> 50:58.860]  for the be on TV, right?
[50:58.860 --> 51:00.900]  It just seemed like that was the thing.
[51:00.900 --> 51:03.620]  I got older and realized that's not what I wanted.
[51:03.620 --> 51:05.220]  So I don't know how much of it is that,
[51:05.220 --> 51:07.860]  and I don't know how much of it is the fact
[51:07.860 --> 51:11.620]  that earning money through YouTube
[51:11.620 --> 51:15.220]  is definitely possible and sustainable.
[51:15.220 --> 51:16.420]  Not easy, right?
[51:16.420 --> 51:19.740]  It's never easy, but it is real.
[51:19.740 --> 51:23.500]  Like that's part of the tremendous success of YouTube
[51:23.500 --> 51:27.420]  is that they've got a system in place that is legitimate
[51:27.420 --> 51:30.460]  where they're aggregating tremendous amounts of attention
[51:30.460 --> 51:32.260]  from viewers worldwide,
[51:32.260 --> 51:35.620]  getting advertisers to pay real money
[51:35.620 --> 51:37.900]  to put their ads in front of those people
[51:37.900 --> 51:41.060]  and the advertisers are getting real results
[51:41.060 --> 51:42.580]  from those things.
[51:42.580 --> 51:47.060]  So it perpetrates itself in a healthy fashion.
[51:47.060 --> 51:48.700]  So I could see why people are drawn to that.
[51:48.700 --> 51:51.180]  Whereas writing articles and making money
[51:51.180 --> 51:55.180]  from writing articles is really tough.
[51:55.180 --> 52:00.020]  And I think only getting tougher, unfortunately.
[52:00.020 --> 52:01.660]  Yeah, well, if you think about somebody
[52:01.660 --> 52:03.180]  who wants to start their own website,
[52:03.180 --> 52:04.260]  like they're probably gonna start
[52:04.260 --> 52:07.020]  with like a free word space or a WordPress, sorry,
[52:07.020 --> 52:09.980]  or a blogger space, and maybe they'll upgrade
[52:09.980 --> 52:11.780]  and actually pay to have their own domain.
[52:11.780 --> 52:14.500]  Or maybe they'll think, no, why should I pay for anything
[52:14.500 --> 52:15.460]  until I make money?
[52:15.460 --> 52:19.220]  And spoiler, catch-22, you're not gonna be trustworthy
[52:19.220 --> 52:20.940]  until you have your own domain name.
[52:20.940 --> 52:22.780]  You know, if you're not paying for a domain name
[52:22.780 --> 52:25.020]  until you make money, then you're stuck.
[52:25.020 --> 52:26.540]  But the thing is, if you do that,
[52:26.540 --> 52:28.660]  even if you do everything right,
[52:28.660 --> 52:31.220]  you're against everything else,
[52:31.220 --> 52:33.180]  which is going into the search results.
[52:33.180 --> 52:36.940]  Whereas if you start on YouTube or TikTok or Instagram,
[52:36.940 --> 52:39.340]  then like people are already there
[52:39.340 --> 52:42.620]  searching for a particular kind of thing.
[52:42.620 --> 52:44.940]  And so the algorithm is gonna do a better job
[52:44.940 --> 52:46.500]  of funneling them towards stuff.
[52:46.500 --> 52:48.700]  And especially if you've managed to get yourself
[52:48.700 --> 52:51.540]  into a playlist of some kind
[52:51.540 --> 52:53.540]  that's useful things about this or that.
[52:53.540 --> 52:56.300]  I remember when I was studying computer science in Austria,
[52:56.300 --> 52:58.020]  I was struggling with some of the mathematical terms
[52:58.020 --> 53:01.340]  just because the names unsurprisingly were foreign to me
[53:01.340 --> 53:02.180]  because they were German.
[53:02.180 --> 53:05.100]  And so I had to like learn the concept in class
[53:05.100 --> 53:06.860]  and sort of vaguely understand it and then go home,
[53:06.860 --> 53:08.860]  figure out what that concept was in English
[53:08.860 --> 53:11.300]  and then relearn it so I would properly understand it.
[53:11.300 --> 53:14.500]  So I ended up following a lot of random mathematics
[53:14.500 --> 53:17.580]  and computer science channels for that sort of logic stuff.
[53:17.580 --> 53:19.300]  But I found them all through playlists
[53:19.300 --> 53:20.980]  that other students have put together,
[53:20.980 --> 53:22.900]  which we shared in class.
[53:22.900 --> 53:25.220]  And if you get onto something like that,
[53:25.220 --> 53:27.060]  then you get people coming to your channel
[53:27.060 --> 53:28.580]  and then they click and find the other stuff.
[53:28.580 --> 53:30.740]  And it happens relatively organically,
[53:30.740 --> 53:34.540]  but just going into the whole ocean of content,
[53:34.540 --> 53:38.740]  as big as YouTube is, it's not that big.
[53:38.740 --> 53:41.460]  It's a lake compared to the whole of the internet,
[53:41.460 --> 53:43.580]  which has got all the sharks and everything else in there
[53:43.580 --> 53:46.620]  with those people doing the bad SEO stuff.
[53:46.620 --> 53:48.500]  Yeah, and I guess too with,
[53:48.500 --> 53:50.660]  I mean, I don't think there's many people competing
[53:50.660 --> 53:52.540]  with your book with TikTok content
[53:52.540 --> 53:54.180]  on how to do things in shortcuts.
[53:54.180 --> 53:55.700]  I mean, it went viral, right?
[53:55.700 --> 53:57.340]  The home screens, customized home screens,
[53:57.340 --> 53:59.300]  so shortcuts went viral on TikTok.
[53:59.300 --> 54:02.340]  Right, the customized home screens was humongous.
[54:02.340 --> 54:05.580]  I had David Smith of Widget Smith
[54:05.580 --> 54:08.940]  and various other famous on shortly after that.
[54:08.940 --> 54:10.980]  So yeah, that was driver.
[54:10.980 --> 54:13.340]  I mean, but I'm not quite sure though
[54:13.340 --> 54:18.340]  that that explained to people how to do it.
[54:18.340 --> 54:21.060]  Like I think what the TikTok for that did,
[54:21.060 --> 54:23.460]  which was a genuine sensation
[54:23.460 --> 54:25.180]  and for people who don't remember it,
[54:25.180 --> 54:26.980]  was it iOS 14 just a year ago
[54:26.980 --> 54:29.620]  or was it two years ago with iOS 13?
[54:29.620 --> 54:31.580]  I think it was two years ago when I was 14
[54:31.580 --> 54:34.540]  because we're about to have the release of 16.
[54:34.540 --> 54:35.860]  Oh yeah, that's right, that's right.
[54:35.860 --> 54:37.860]  Yeah, so I was right that it was two years ago
[54:37.860 --> 54:39.740]  and got my version numbers mixed up.
[54:39.740 --> 54:41.460]  But there was like this TikTok that was like,
[54:41.460 --> 54:42.660]  hey, look what you can do
[54:42.660 --> 54:44.660]  because what you can do with shortcuts,
[54:44.660 --> 54:47.740]  I guess it's two key things that you can do
[54:47.740 --> 54:51.380]  is you can have a shortcut that just opens a specific app,
[54:51.380 --> 54:53.380]  like let's say Instagram.
[54:53.380 --> 54:54.940]  What does this shortcut do?
[54:54.940 --> 54:57.060]  It launches Instagram.
[54:57.060 --> 54:59.860]  The other thing you can do is you can give the shortcut
[54:59.860 --> 55:02.540]  whatever icon you want, or I guess three things.
[55:02.540 --> 55:05.820]  You can have a shortcut, open an app and do nothing else.
[55:05.820 --> 55:07.940]  You can give it a custom icon
[55:07.940 --> 55:10.660]  and you can add it to your home screen.
[55:10.660 --> 55:13.020]  And you can give it a custom name as well if you want.
[55:13.020 --> 55:14.380]  And a custom name, right?
[55:14.380 --> 55:16.180]  Custom icon and name.
[55:16.180 --> 55:20.140]  So all of a sudden, let's say you're a neat Nick
[55:20.140 --> 55:23.140]  and the app library feature certainly makes this
[55:23.140 --> 55:26.180]  so much easier to do to just sort of have like,
[55:26.180 --> 55:31.180]  even just one home screen of organized icons on your iPhone
[55:31.300 --> 55:33.260]  and then just put all your other apps
[55:33.260 --> 55:36.020]  that you do have installed over in the app library.
[55:36.020 --> 55:39.460]  You could go through and with just going through
[55:39.460 --> 55:44.060]  like a dozen to 16 icons, do them one by one,
[55:44.060 --> 55:45.180]  it's not that much work.
[55:45.180 --> 55:49.620]  Give each a custom icon that's like from a theme pack,
[55:49.620 --> 55:52.420]  get a themed wallpaper that goes with them
[55:52.420 --> 55:54.540]  and then all of a sudden your iPhone home screen
[55:54.540 --> 55:56.660]  doesn't look like an iPhone home screen.
[55:56.660 --> 55:58.540]  It looks like whatever it is,
[55:58.540 --> 56:02.580]  the thing that you're like Tron or Star Wars or super cool.
[56:02.580 --> 56:06.900]  And a total throwback to like the classic days of Mac OS,
[56:06.900 --> 56:09.380]  like when I was in college in the nineties,
[56:09.380 --> 56:14.380]  everybody who was a Mac super nerd like me at the time,
[56:15.100 --> 56:17.060]  we loved customizing the icons.
[56:17.060 --> 56:20.660]  Oh, and that's when Icon Factory, I first grew to know them
[56:20.660 --> 56:22.660]  and they would release like icon packs
[56:22.660 --> 56:24.820]  and they'd have like these alternate versions
[56:24.820 --> 56:26.060]  of all the popular apps
[56:26.060 --> 56:28.980]  and you could like customize all your popular apps
[56:28.980 --> 56:32.300]  with these custom icons that were drawn by awesome artists.
[56:33.220 --> 56:35.620]  And it's like, so that took off,
[56:35.620 --> 56:37.700]  but I guess that the people who watched that TikTok
[56:37.700 --> 56:39.060]  and wanted to do that with their phone
[56:39.060 --> 56:40.620]  then needed to somehow Google,
[56:40.620 --> 56:43.020]  well, how exactly do I do this step-by-step?
[56:43.020 --> 56:44.460]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, I think there were some
[56:44.460 --> 56:46.700]  like instruction videos like in that
[56:46.700 --> 56:49.300]  where people were like showing off various custom screens
[56:49.300 --> 56:52.100]  and then they did like, hey, so like you open this app
[56:52.100 --> 56:53.860]  and then you add this open app action
[56:53.860 --> 56:54.860]  and you select the app
[56:54.860 --> 56:56.260]  and then you do the add to home screen,
[56:56.260 --> 56:58.180]  you select the image from the pack you've downloaded
[56:58.180 --> 57:00.100]  and stuff, but it is quite a few steps
[57:00.100 --> 57:03.580]  for somebody to just figure out entirely by themselves.
[57:03.580 --> 57:05.140]  And yeah, Googling it,
[57:05.140 --> 57:07.780]  like how do I add a shortcut to my home screen?
[57:07.780 --> 57:10.020]  I think like, I haven't tested this,
[57:10.020 --> 57:12.780]  but I'm 95 to 98% certain
[57:12.780 --> 57:15.580]  that will still be a Safari bookmark in most cases,
[57:15.580 --> 57:17.740]  like that will be the default result
[57:17.740 --> 57:21.460]  because that's kind of what home screen shortcuts used to be
[57:21.460 --> 57:23.460]  and now they might be a progressive web app
[57:23.460 --> 57:25.660]  where it launches in its own little container.
[57:25.660 --> 57:28.060]  Wordle did that, which was really cool,
[57:28.060 --> 57:31.260]  but it's really difficult to just be able to search
[57:31.260 --> 57:33.340]  and find out something about shortcuts
[57:33.340 --> 57:35.820]  because what is a shortcut anyway?
[57:35.820 --> 57:38.460]  Like it's a really difficult concept to describe to somebody,
[57:38.460 --> 57:40.700]  what is a shortcut and what is an action
[57:40.700 --> 57:43.580]  and why does this app have actions, but this app doesn't?
[57:43.580 --> 57:46.300]  And well, Apple's helping developers fix that in iOS 16
[57:46.300 --> 57:48.260]  by making it a lot easier for them, thank God,
[57:48.260 --> 57:51.860]  but it is a very difficult concept to just Google
[57:51.860 --> 57:54.420]  and it's the same if you're trying to do something in Pages,
[57:54.420 --> 57:56.860]  like I love Pages, don't get me wrong.
[57:56.860 --> 57:58.540]  The iWork Suite, at the very least,
[57:58.540 --> 58:00.140]  if you type Pages iWork,
[58:00.140 --> 58:01.700]  you'll get a whole bunch more results
[58:01.700 --> 58:03.020]  which are way more on track
[58:03.020 --> 58:05.100]  and a lot of sites are really good
[58:05.100 --> 58:06.660]  about putting the word iWork in there
[58:06.660 --> 58:08.300]  when they're talking about pages.
[58:08.300 --> 58:10.540]  Like Pages, part of the iWork Suite has this feature
[58:10.540 --> 58:12.820]  and here's how you use it, but yeah.
[58:12.820 --> 58:16.380]  But yeah, you're right, Numbers is another one.
[58:16.380 --> 58:21.380]  Keynote on the other hand is the most Googleable
[58:22.380 --> 58:23.540]  of the names, right?
[58:23.540 --> 58:27.540]  That's, because even in the generic sense
[58:27.540 --> 58:30.260]  of the word keynote, Apple is very well known
[58:30.260 --> 58:32.780]  for its keynotes, it tends to lead you there.
[58:32.780 --> 58:37.780]  But yeah, so this is why I think books like yours
[58:38.500 --> 58:41.580]  are still important and the whole point
[58:41.580 --> 58:45.420]  of this whole discussion is to encourage people
[58:45.420 --> 58:48.140]  who are listening to think back to how much
[58:48.140 --> 58:50.980]  you've learned in the past from good books.
[58:50.980 --> 58:53.980]  I mean it, and I'm sure most people
[58:53.980 --> 58:57.660]  who are using shortcuts do it the one search
[58:57.660 --> 59:00.100]  by at a time way of getting into it,
[59:00.100 --> 59:02.880]  but I find that daunting.
[59:02.880 --> 59:04.680]  And I know other people feel differently.
[59:04.680 --> 59:06.540]  There's some people whose personality is such
[59:06.540 --> 59:08.700]  is that they've always hated books, right?
[59:08.700 --> 59:10.560]  I don't know, to each their own.
[59:10.560 --> 59:14.860]  But to me, whenever I learn something new,
[59:14.860 --> 59:17.340]  I just have like a compulsive need
[59:18.620 --> 59:21.920]  not to understand the entirety of the thing,
[59:21.920 --> 59:23.660]  not to have it all in my head,
[59:23.660 --> 59:27.900]  but to at least have a general idea of the whole thing.
[59:27.900 --> 59:31.280]  Like what exactly, what's the basic idea with shortcuts
[59:31.280 --> 59:34.220]  and what is the extent of what I can do?
[59:34.220 --> 59:37.980]  What are the sort of things I can expect to be able to do?
[59:37.980 --> 59:42.980]  And that sort of fundamental high level overview
[59:45.220 --> 59:49.460]  is to me so much, there's never,
[59:49.460 --> 59:52.580]  there still is nothing's been better invented
[59:52.580 --> 59:57.380]  than a well-written, well-organized book for that.
[59:57.380 --> 01:00:01.060]  Whether it's actually printed on paper
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:04.300]  or it's an ebook like the Take Control series
[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.500]  or a book that's on the web,
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:10.580]  but like a book-length thing that has an order
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:14.100]  start to finish and you can, yes, jump to the middle
[01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:16.220]  or search for just the one solution.
[01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:18.980]  But that sort of understanding, and to me,
[01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:22.740]  you accomplish that for shortcuts
[01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:25.140]  as well as I could imagine.
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:27.100]  Thank you, that is a very big compliment
[01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:29.860]  because it is a real challenge looking at this
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:33.060]  and I understand shortcuts and I'm a developer,
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:35.380]  which is basically like a massive cheat
[01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:37.740]  for the whole shortcuts things because guess what?
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:40.220]  A repeat with each is, it's a for each loop
[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:43.200]  and a repeat is a for loop and I understand these things
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:44.700]  and I understand the concepts of it,
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:46.100]  but then having to figure out,
[01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:48.940]  well, if I didn't understand any of this,
[01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:51.420]  where on earth would I need to start
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:53.460]  and how can I convey that to somebody
[01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:56.680]  and why are variables important and what is this
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:58.940]  and why do I need to know that it's called a variable?
[01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:00.340]  Is that actually important?
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:03.220]  And trying to figure out all of that is really tricky,
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:05.140]  but I have to say, being able to just pick up
[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:07.400]  some of the other take control books and skim through them
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:10.940]  and see the little side notes that they've got in there
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:12.280]  of like, oh, by the way, hey,
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:14.140]  there's this really cool thing that you can find
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:16.540]  if you right click on this and you press the option key.
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:18.940]  And it's like, wow, didn't know that you could do that.
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:20.200]  That's amazing, thanks.
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.740]  I keep forgetting to press the option key
[01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:24.180]  when I right click or option click on things.
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.520]  That's something that, again, it's how do you search
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:29.220]  for this hidden menu feature on the Mac?
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:31.220]  It's really difficult, but it's right there.
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:34.420]  But being able to go through and use other examples
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:37.300]  as a place to get started has been really helpful.
[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:39.180]  So that's the first thing I want to encourage
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:42.500]  people listening, is to just, if shortcuts
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.460]  is one of these things that's been on your list
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:47.260]  of you could just feel it in your bones
[01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:48.980]  that maybe you should get more into them,
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:50.280]  maybe you've tinkered a little.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:53.380]  Rosemary's book, you should get it and read it
[01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:57.920]  and it will fill in those gaps of what is the basic scope
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.800]  of what you think you can get done?
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.980]  What are the sort of things you can do
[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:05.500]  in a way that you'll never get just by Googling
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:09.280]  for specific things from Stack Overflow
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:10.220]  or something like that?
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:13.820]  And Apple does have pretty good documentation for shortcuts.
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:18.460]  It's not undocumented, but it's still,
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:21.760]  it's like the difference between a dictionary
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:24.540]  and a book about how to write.
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.380]  Yeah.
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:27.580]  Like Strunk and White's The Elements of Style
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:30.300]  or Zinzor's a fantastic book.
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:32.980]  I know the one you mean, it's on tip of my tongue
[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:34.420]  and there's a subreddit for tip of my tongue
[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:35.740]  for anybody who's looking for something
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:37.260]  that they can't quite remember the name.
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:38.820]  On Writing Well.
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.060]  That's it, that's the one.
[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:42.020]  By William Zinzor, I can't believe,
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:43.860]  that's a sign that I need to read it again.
[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:46.500]  That is a book that I have read cover to cover
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.860]  at least twice and now the fact that it wasn't
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:51.040]  on the tip of my tongue means I should read it again.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.940]  But it's the difference between Zinzor's On Writing Well,
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:57.140]  which is fantastic and a dictionary is just a reference
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:59.640]  and to me, Apple's documentation is a reference
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.340]  and there should be a reference, right?
[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:02.580]  It's not a complaint.
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:05.180]  All right, we'll get further into it
[01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:06.600]  but let me take a second break here
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:09.700]  and speaking of starting your own website,
[01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.780]  let me tell you about Squarespace.
[01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:15.380]  Ha ha, segue to a sponsor.
[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:17.620]  Look, Squarespace is if you're looking
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:21.540]  at building your own website under your own name
[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:25.340]  or for your own business or for the business of somebody
[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:28.960]  but a website that you own and control,
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.380]  including the domain name,
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:33.460]  which you can register through Squarespace.
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:35.500]  Squarespace is the all-in-one product
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:38.580]  that I recommend you try first, I really do.
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:40.440]  They've got so many great features.
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:43.260]  They've got stuff like, for example, member areas.
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:45.720]  They make it easy for creators to monetize their content
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.660]  and expertise in a way that fits their brand
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:50.620]  and with member areas, you can unlock a new revenue stream
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:52.700]  for your business and free up time in your schedule
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:57.660]  by selling access to gated content like videos,
[01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.620]  online courses or even newsletters
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:03.820]  so that you could say, hey, my video content on my website
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:05.580]  is for paying customers, here's how you pay.
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:08.800]  You can do that all through Squarespace.
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:11.820]  Analytics, they have the best analytics dashboard,
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:13.380]  honestly, that I have ever seen.
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.900]  Every other analytics thing I've ever seen,
[01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:18.380]  almost always, is confusing.
[01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:20.060]  Squarespace is so simple.
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:23.860]  It is well presented and shows you the sort of stuff,
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:26.100]  who's coming to your site from where,
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:28.420]  what's popular, what's not on your site.
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:30.340]  Online stores, you have something to sell,
[01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:34.380]  you could do that through your Squarespace site too.
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:37.940]  Head to squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:40.980]  That's the URL, squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:44.620]  Keep it in mind, you get a free trial, 30 days,
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:47.160]  there's no watermarks, nothing like that.
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:49.540]  You could just have 30 days to make your site,
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:51.820]  try it out, get it just the way you want it
[01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:54.180]  and it's the real deal with no limits
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:55.880]  and when you're ready to launch,
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:57.980]  just remember that code, talk show.
[01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:01.540]  No the, just talk show, squarespace.com slash talk show
[01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:05.020]  but that code saves you 10% off your first purchase,
[01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:07.380]  including prepaying for up to a year.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.260]  My thanks to Squarespace.
[01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:12.820]  So, one of the things,
[01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:14.900]  I'm wondering if you have thoughts on this.
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:17.540]  So it's going back to the name shortcuts
[01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:19.980]  and in addition to the searchability,
[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:24.300]  there's also the fluidity of writing
[01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:27.060]  about the things you make in shortcuts
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:28.900]  that are from shortcuts,
[01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:31.740]  which are shortcuts, right?
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:34.060]  Yeah, so when they changed the name
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:35.700]  from shortcuts to workflow,
[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:38.980]  I suggested that, sorry, from workflow to shortcuts,
[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:40.860]  I suggested that you call anything
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:43.580]  that you created in the app a workflow
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:45.740]  so that you would have shortcuts workflow
[01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:47.420]  or workflow in shortcuts
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:49.840]  and that to me was just like a perfect way
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:51.900]  of like let's avoid any confusion
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:53.460]  but instead you have shortcuts,
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.420]  capital S, plural, the app,
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:58.220]  shortcuts, lowercase, plural,
[01:05:58.220 --> 01:05:59.940]  which are all of the things that you create
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:01.460]  in the shortcuts app
[01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:04.500]  and then you have a shortcut, lowercase, singular,
[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.820]  which is a single shortcut
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:08.300]  and oh my God, it's confusing.
[01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:12.100]  It is, it's confusing and as the writer,
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:15.920]  you're the, we're the ones who try to dance around it
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.460]  and rearrange sentences
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:21.540]  so that we can avoid writing capital shortcuts shortcut.
[01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:23.500]  So create a new shortcuts shortcut
[01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.580]  and then even as a podcaster,
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:27.540]  it ends up being a tongue twister.
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:28.980]  I kind of thought the same thing,
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:30.700]  which I wanna come back to this point in a second
[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:34.740]  but shortcuts originally was a third party app
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:37.740]  called Workflow or was it workflows?
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:39.980]  I forget now whether it was plural or not
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:41.900]  but it would have been natural.
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:44.340]  I don't know what Apple was thinking.
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:47.020]  I could see why they might've wanted to change the name
[01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:48.420]  because now that they own the product,
[01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:50.460]  maybe they thought shortcuts was a better name
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:51.740]  for the whole platform
[01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:55.780]  but it would have been nice if they named them workflows
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:59.300]  and that's what the things are called in Automator.
[01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:02.140]  When in Automator, you make a workflow.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.580]  Yes.
[01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:06.020]  The long standing one,
[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:08.460]  I mean, and literally going back to the early 90s
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:11.460]  is AppleScript or what do you make with AppleScripts?
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.320]  AppleScript scripts.
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:14.160]  Yeah.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.940]  Which isn't as awkward.
[01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:19.560]  In my opinion, we've gone even worse with shortcuts
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:23.220]  but AppleScript scripts has never,
[01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:27.940]  it just somehow seems, I hate it.
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:30.820]  Yes, yeah, it is just so difficult
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:33.040]  and it doesn't roll off the tongue, right?
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:35.180]  There's something about a really good name
[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:37.020]  that just, it just works, right?
[01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:38.740]  Like DeLorean, okay?
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:40.360]  DeLorean just works, okay?
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.340]  Everybody immediately thinks back to the future,
[01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:46.220]  Flux Capacitor but shortcuts, shortcut
[01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:50.820]  or shortcuts actions, what the, no, it just,
[01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:52.660]  it does, it's staccato, right?
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:56.000]  Rather than legato, so it just doesn't feel as nice.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.020]  It's just, yeah, yeah, it's frustrating.
[01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:00.260]  Yeah, and so many, yeah,
[01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:01.980]  there are some names that just worked.
[01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:04.460]  I would say a predominant number
[01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:09.220]  of famous scripting languages have names that just work.
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:11.500]  Perl, Ruby, Python.
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:13.900]  JavaScript has the same problem AppleScript has
[01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:17.580]  and has a second problem which is that it's-
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:18.780]  Java.
[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:21.340]  Yeah, it sounds like it has something to do with Java
[01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:23.380]  and the only thing it has to do with Java,
[01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:26.280]  the one and only thing JavaScript relates to Java
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:29.300]  is that Java was very popular at the time.
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:31.540]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, like that's literally it.
[01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:34.060]  The number of times that I've seen people asking,
[01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:37.980]  like, hey, so how can I do this in Java space script?
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:39.420]  And I'm there going, hey,
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:41.580]  it looks like you're asking a question about scriptable
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:43.500]  and I feel like clippy when I do this, okay?
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.020]  The paperclip in Microsoft Word,
[01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.860]  but it's like, it's really important
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:48.420]  that you get rid of that space.
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:51.440]  I know that that seems completely and utterly illogical
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.020]  and irrelevant to you right now,
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:55.140]  but I promise you, if you delete that space,
[01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:57.260]  you're gonna get much better search results
[01:08:57.260 --> 01:08:58.700]  than what you're currently getting
[01:08:58.700 --> 01:08:59.600]  because what you're currently getting
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.280]  is completely and utterly unrelated.
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:03.700]  If only it were that easy with shortcuts, shortcuts.
[01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:06.620]  Well, I have to say that's one of the things
[01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:09.220]  that you successfully, at a meta level,
[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:10.740]  as I read the second edition
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:12.980]  and I knew that I wanted to have you on the show,
[01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:15.500]  I was like thinking, and I wanted to talk about this issue,
[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:19.140]  you successfully avoided it from cover to cover.
[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:22.460]  Well, I'm gonna say that all credit for that
[01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:25.460]  and all correctly placed commas goes to Joe Kissel,
[01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:28.340]  the editor and one of the folks in charge over at Take Control
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:31.060]  because he went through the book with a fine tooth comb
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:33.740]  looking for anything that sounded awkward or weird
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:35.600]  or didn't make any sense at all
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:37.060]  and really helped with that.
[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:37.900]  There's something to be said
[01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:38.880]  for having a really great editor
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:42.420]  and Joe has definitely served that role extremely well here
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:44.620]  and it wouldn't have been possible to do this without him,
[01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:47.260]  so I'm glad his hard work paid off.
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:51.680]  Which gets back to the value of a really well-written book
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:55.900]  from a good author with good editors.
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:58.600]  That lack of distraction, even for those out there
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.660]  who've never really thought about the awkwardness
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:03.180]  of a shortcut's shortcut,
[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:06.060]  the fact that somebody's there to avoid it
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:08.220]  means that while you're trying to learn something,
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:11.220]  you're not distracted by, hey, that looks weird.
[01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:12.660]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:15.220]  And the number of times I wrote something
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:19.340]  and then I just highlighted it with strikethrough
[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:20.560]  or formatted it with strikethrough
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.820]  and then wrote TK, TK next to it,
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:25.800]  which is the two characters that you won't find together
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.700]  in the English language, TK, done twice,
[01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:30.260]  it's the old editor's trick.
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:32.300]  This is something that needs fixing.
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:35.060]  I just can't think of a better way to write this right now,
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:37.700]  so I'm just gonna word vomit it somehow
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:39.140]  and then come back and fix it later
[01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:40.980]  because it needs a better way of doing it
[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:42.780]  and sometimes to do the right thing, right,
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:43.900]  you have to do the wrong thing
[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:45.060]  because once you've done the wrong thing,
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:46.540]  you'll see the right way to do it
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:47.500]  and other times it was like,
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:50.740]  I'm just gonna give this to like three of my friends
[01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:54.100]  and just say, hey, can you think of any kind of better way
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:56.740]  maybe to get started writing this bit?
[01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:59.900]  Like at all, any suggestions, throw a dart.
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:01.900]  If it sounds even vaguely better than what I've got,
[01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:04.340]  I'll start with it and see what I can do later.
[01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:08.020]  We mentioned Apple's official shortcuts
[01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:09.480]  reference documentation
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:12.260]  and as I just mentioned Automator,
[01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:13.340]  I made a note of it
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:15.060]  because I thought it was so perfectly said
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:18.960]  is in your book, you mention Automator
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:21.460]  when it gets to the point talking about shortcuts for Mac
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:23.240]  and hey, what should you be using?
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:27.620]  Automator or shortcuts if you want to automate this thing
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:29.900]  and it might, maybe it's only on the Mac
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:32.740]  that you wanna do it or maybe like in both cases,
[01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:35.500]  both shortcuts and Automator can do things
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:38.580]  like run an Apple script or run a shell script
[01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:40.700]  which are things you can't do on iOS
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:42.100]  but you can do them in shortcuts
[01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:44.820]  but therefore only on shortcuts for Mac
[01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:46.540]  but should you use Automator instead?
[01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:49.560]  And you have a nice little aside in the book
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:52.900]  that just says, hey, Apple hasn't said Automator
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:55.060]  is definitely going away
[01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:58.900]  but it sorta seems like that's the way the wind is blowing
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:01.340]  and that shortcuts is the future
[01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:03.420]  and if you really wanna use Automator, use it,
[01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:05.140]  I'm paraphrasing here, not reading
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:07.780]  but you know, shortcuts is probably a sure bet
[01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:10.260]  for a thing that's going to last.
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:15.260]  A, that's to me exactly what I mean about like as a reader
[01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:17.060]  who wants to know about shortcuts,
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:20.520]  like that's context of okay, I get it.
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:21.980]  It's not just that shortcuts is new
[01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:24.220]  but it probably is the other one,
[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:27.300]  the older Automator probably is going away
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:29.540]  so I should try to do it in shortcuts first
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:32.740]  but it's also the sort of plain language
[01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:35.420]  that Apple is never going to use in their own documentation.
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:37.860]  No, and they can't say something like that because
[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:39.660]  until they've officially announced
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:41.260]  that something's going away,
[01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:43.060]  implying that something is going away
[01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:45.740]  is tantamount to saying it's dead
[01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:47.780]  and you know what happens when somebody comes out
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:48.740]  with it's dead, Jim.
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:50.620]  There's troubles everywhere suddenly
[01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:52.140]  or maybe not as the case may be
[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:53.900]  but you know, they can't explicitly say
[01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:56.640]  that something's going away without saying,
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:59.000]  hey, and this thing is a drop-in replacement for it
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.960]  or a replacement and it's difficult, it is
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:04.480]  but shortcuts is so much easier to use than Automator
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:08.780]  in this case that you know, I can't really think of
[01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:11.300]  a huge number of use cases where using Automator
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:13.300]  is going to be the better solution.
[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:15.980]  There are some actions that are only in Automator still
[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:18.400]  for whatever reason and I presume the shortcuts team
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.700]  has been working really hard to try and get those
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.980]  last outstanding ones over
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:26.020]  but Automator was able to do something as simple
[01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:28.300]  as a dynamic name and file name
[01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:30.220]  so you'd have to go and update your Automator workflow
[01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:31.380]  every time you wanted to run it
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:33.940]  and of course shortcuts can ask for input,
[01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:35.420]  it can just input your current date,
[01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:37.900]  it can reformat things and so on on the fly,
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:40.460]  farm it out to another shortcut and get it back,
[01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:43.460]  send it through any number of other applications
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:46.740]  either using shortcuts or AppleScript or ShellScript
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:48.540]  if you want or JavaScript for automation
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:50.700]  if you're really into torturing yourself,
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:52.340]  please don't do that folks, it's there
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:54.300]  but that doesn't mean you should use it
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:58.220]  but you know, there's a lot of more easy possibilities
[01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:00.900]  and let's face it, the Automator UI hasn't been updated
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:03.420]  in a really long time and it's a real shame
[01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:04.980]  because I know some of the folks who worked on it
[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:06.220]  and they worked really hard on it
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:07.620]  and they did a really great job
[01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:11.040]  but it just unfortunately seemed like it never really hit
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:13.860]  that critical mess that shortcuts has
[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:17.140]  and honestly some of the best actions for Automator
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:19.880]  were actually from Microsoft as part of the Office Suite,
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:21.980]  they had some really great ones specifically
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:25.620]  like Microsoft Word converting Word documents to PDFs
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:27.140]  and things like that, that was all stuff
[01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:28.820]  that you could do with Automator
[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:32.160]  and you couldn't do it once they took those actions away
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:33.660]  but shortcuts can do that
[01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:36.620]  because it can make anything into a PDF pretty much.
[01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:41.620]  Microsoft's always been very good about wanting to empower
[01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:45.340]  for lack of a better word, power users
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:46.700]  who might want to do this,
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:49.620]  people who don't consider themselves programmers
[01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:51.960]  or even if they are programmers,
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:54.000]  don't want to program a solution,
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.940]  just want to gin up something to automate this thing
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:00.420]  that they do over and over again.
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:03.380]  Every couple of days I need to make a new invoice
[01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:05.100]  and every time I make a new invoice,
[01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:09.160]  I want it to fill in the date and this and that
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:14.160]  and doing that manually each time is A, a pain
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:18.000]  and B, it's a possible source of a mistake
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.620]  where you forgot to put the date in
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:24.260]  and the date is just 11, 1900 or something like that.
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:27.660]  Microsoft's always been good at that so I'm not surprised
[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:30.060]  but it is true that Automator somehow failed
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:34.180]  to capture a critical mass that even AppleScript did.
[01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:36.500]  I feel like AppleScript's future
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:41.500]  is quite possibly permanent and I mean for years,
[01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:46.500]  as somebody who's been an enthusiastic AppleScript user
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:51.500]  since AppleScript debuted in system 7.1 I think,
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:53.580]  I don't know, maybe it was 7.5
[01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:56.020]  but at some point in the system seven era
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:58.540]  but it never, in the early years of Mac OS X,
[01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:00.300]  I felt like, oh man, there's no way
[01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:03.060]  that they're gonna keep AppleScript around for long
[01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:05.500]  because it just wasn't the great fit
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:10.500]  for the Mac OS X Cocoa and Next Foundation
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:14.940]  but then the AppleScript workflows and lowercase W
[01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:17.740]  that are out there are so essential to so many's needs,
[01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:20.060]  so many people's needs and really can't be replaced
[01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:23.060]  by anything else whereas I think that's the difference
[01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:26.300]  with Automator too is it's easy to envision
[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:29.260]  how shortcuts will soon be able
[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:31.020]  to do everything Automator did
[01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:33.380]  and therefore why not get rid of the old one?
[01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:36.020]  Yeah, exactly and it really does feel like,
[01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:38.780]  you know, when workflow first came out
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:41.900]  on the iPhone and the iPad, a lot of folks looked at it
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:44.420]  and said this is Automator for my iPhone.
[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:46.560]  This is really cool because they do look really similar.
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.020]  They've got blocks that you drag in,
[01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:49.420]  there's a line running between them
[01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:51.060]  and you pass data between your blocks
[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:52.860]  and it goes from the top to the bottom
[01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:55.860]  and now that we've got two of these things,
[01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:58.940]  both from Apple on our Mac and one of them
[01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:02.820]  can import the workflows from the other.
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:05.060]  Like that bit there really just underscores
[01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:07.580]  that shortcuts will replace Automator.
[01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:11.380]  Right and again, that aside is just the perfect sort of note
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:13.180]  your book is filled with notes like that
[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:15.580]  that just give people a little bit of context.
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:17.860]  You can just read this book and get caught up
[01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:21.280]  on knowing the state of things like that
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:23.580]  and now you've got this high level view.
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:26.220]  I think what you just mentioning,
[01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:29.500]  workflow debuting on iOS and iPad,
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:32.220]  God, I don't know how long, maybe like 10 years ago?
[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:34.100]  Yeah, it was a long time ago now.
[01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:36.180]  It was, I think it must have been at least seven
[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:38.040]  or so years ago because I was studying
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:40.180]  for my computer science degree at the time
[01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:42.620]  when it was really starting to become more popular.
[01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:43.860]  It was out on the App Store then.
[01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:46.540]  I'm going to admit something very cynical
[01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:48.180]  and I am embarrassed to admit it
[01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:50.660]  because I think I should professionally
[01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:52.460]  have the opposite attitude.
[01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:54.860]  But when it came out and I read about it
[01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:57.140]  and I took a look at it and I was like,
[01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:59.740]  ah, I get it and I sort of got that first impression
[01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:02.180]  of yeah, it's like Automator for iOS, right?
[01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:06.620]  I just assumed that coming from a third party
[01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:09.700]  and knowing the technical restrictions
[01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:14.700]  of third party apps on iOS, that this can't be that useful
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:17.580]  and that it sort of gets to the broader
[01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:21.840]  philosophical argument about iOS's restrictions
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:26.840]  being good for the typical non-technical user's protection
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:32.060]  and safety and it's why people like and love,
[01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:35.700]  love their iPhones and iPads more than they ever learned
[01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:38.380]  a computer, including a Mac, many people,
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:43.180]  so most people because they can't do anything
[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:44.540]  to mess it up, right?
[01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:47.580]  I cannot overstate to people who really believe
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:52.420]  that the iOS should be as open as the Mac
[01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:55.340]  to non-app store apps and stuff like that.
[01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:56.520]  Please don't let that happen.
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:58.300]  I can't let my grandmother keep her iPad,
[01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:00.160]  if that's the case.
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:03.320]  It's, I just can't emphasize enough how many times
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:07.740]  I know firsthand from people and talking to fellow nerds
[01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:10.620]  like me and you, but who have family members
[01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:14.980]  or a father-in-law or somebody who just used computers
[01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:16.940]  their whole life, maybe they were like an accountant
[01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:19.780]  or something like that and accounting got computerized
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:23.060]  as early as almost any profession because for obvious
[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:24.940]  reasons, once the spreadsheets were invented,
[01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:28.200]  it was groundbreaking and once they had a computer
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:32.100]  that was working, just left it alone until the thing
[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:34.300]  physically broke, right?
[01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:36.820]  So many people like that, like somebody who works
[01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:39.380]  without any kind of IT help, I'll go back
[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:41.500]  to the accountant example, but just an accountant
[01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:45.500]  who works by themself as a one-person operation
[01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:49.180]  but had a computer that worked and they depended
[01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:52.380]  on it, obviously, hopefully backed it up somehow
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:54.420]  and did stuff, but more or less just left it alone
[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:58.180]  and didn't wanna install anything new or upgrade anything
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:01.740]  because they could mess it up and the way that you can't
[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:05.620]  get into a situation like that with iOS is just phenomenal.
[01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:08.380]  But the flip side is, if you are an enthusiast
[01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:11.340]  and you want to do things like we can do on the Mac
[01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:15.380]  and have been able to do and Windows, the limits of iOS
[01:20:15.380 --> 01:20:17.700]  have always been and continue to this day
[01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:19.140]  to be very frustrating.
[01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:22.380]  Yeah, yeah, that everything is inside of a sandbox
[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:25.740]  and workflow works around this a lot and to an extent,
[01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:27.780]  actually, Surecut still does, there's still some
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:30.220]  of those old actions in there using URL schemes.
[01:20:30.220 --> 01:20:32.740]  So where it could read stuff out from iOS,
[01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:34.820]  like reading things out of your calendar and reminders,
[01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:37.460]  it was able to do that using the public APIs,
[01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:39.540]  which are the codes available to developers
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:41.680]  that they can put into their apps to read stuff out of it
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:44.060]  once it's done the pop-up to ask for permission.
[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:45.940]  They were able to do a lot of that for the Apple stuff,
[01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:49.500]  but how do you talk to drafts, OmniFocus, things,
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:50.600]  all of those other apps?
[01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:53.740]  Well, those apps all had these things called X callback URLs
[01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:55.780]  and that's how they communicated.
[01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:58.060]  And for other stuff, they just use web API.
[01:20:58.060 --> 01:20:59.840]  So to publish a post on WordPress,
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:02.460]  it would talk to a WordPress API for your blog
[01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:03.300]  and things like that.
[01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:06.100]  And it's really amazing that they were able to get
[01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:07.780]  all of these things together.
[01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:11.340]  And I remember the outcry when Apple bought shortcuts
[01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:12.660]  and Google Maps disappeared.
[01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:15.460]  And then people realized it was basically
[01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:19.060]  that every developer, every app that a shortcuts or workflow
[01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:20.700]  as it was then it integrated with it,
[01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:22.620]  pretty much just had to sign a disclaimer saying
[01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:25.340]  they weren't gonna sue Apple for integrating with their app.
[01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:28.300]  And Google just left it sitting in a pile somewhere
[01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:29.740]  pretty much.
[01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:32.680]  So eventually that got sorted out and Google Maps is back.
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:35.580]  But people were outraged that Apple stripping Google Maps
[01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:37.600]  out of workflow, how dare they do this?
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:40.220]  And it's like, no, they have to do things differently.
[01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:44.580]  But they were able to integrate with so many things so well
[01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:46.620]  because there were all of these different ways
[01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:47.460]  of accessing it.
[01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:49.860]  And I know Ari and I think Conrad,
[01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:53.620]  part of the original workflow team, they were jailbreakers.
[01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:56.220]  Like they worked on jailbreaking iOS devices.
[01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:58.940]  And that kind of showed a bit in workflow of their solution
[01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:00.820]  of we'll find a way to do this.
[01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:03.300]  Like we're gonna find a way, like there's a crack somewhere
[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:04.780]  and we're gonna figure out how to use it
[01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:07.140]  so we can give people the control that they want.
[01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:08.340]  And now they work at Apple.
[01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:11.900]  That to me is really amazing going from jailbreaking devices
[01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:14.240]  to making your devices so much better
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:16.220]  in such a really cool way.
[01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:20.980]  It reminds me of the line from the first Jurassic Park movie
[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:23.900]  where they said that they bred all the dinosaurs
[01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:27.180]  to be all females so that there wouldn't be any reproduction
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:29.500]  out in the wild, but then they found eggs.
[01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:31.340]  And how in the world is this possible?
[01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:34.300]  And I think it's the Jeff Goldblum, Ian Malcolm character
[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:36.540]  who says, life finds a way.
[01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:37.780]  Or maybe it's the old guy.
[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:40.140]  I have, somebody says it, life finds a way.
[01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:41.980]  But that's sort of what happened
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:45.100]  with inter-application communication on iOS
[01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:49.660]  where the Mac has had a rich, very rich,
[01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:52.700]  officially from Apple sanctioned way
[01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:55.940]  of doing inter-application communication
[01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:59.540]  where one app can talk to another through Apple events
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:02.000]  which are the technology that Apple script
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.060]  is the scripting language on top of.
[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:08.180]  And the gap that workflow and now shortcuts
[01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:10.520]  have grew to take advantage of is exactly what you said,
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:14.940]  that apps could register for their own custom URLs
[01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:16.580]  that they can handle.
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:18.660]  And I don't think Apple was thinking
[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:21.780]  of inter-application communication
[01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:26.420]  of going from drafts to things or from this to that.
[01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:28.280]  It was just sort of a way to open.
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.980]  I think that's what Apple was thinking
[01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:31.820]  was that it would just be a way,
[01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:33.860]  we'll just go back to drafts.
[01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:37.220]  Just a way to open a specific draft.
[01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:40.340]  And then you could get this drafts colon slash slash
[01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:43.860]  and then an identifier for a particular note in drafts.
[01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:45.380]  And then you could open it from anywhere
[01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:47.020]  and you could keep it pasted somewhere
[01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:49.180]  and then you'd click it and it would just jump you right.
[01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:52.500]  It was a way to let an app let you jump to content.
[01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:54.020]  But developers thought, well,
[01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:58.260]  we could do these callback URLs where we'll go to you.
[01:23:58.260 --> 01:24:00.860]  You know, and it was all encoded as the URL.
[01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:03.460]  You know, you had to be a programmer to sort of decipher it.
[01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:05.300]  Literally to decode it.
[01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:08.140]  But then when you did the app that got it
[01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:10.460]  could send you back to where you were.
[01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:12.740]  It was funny though when you started using stuff like that
[01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:15.380]  because part of it is like,
[01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:18.060]  and it shows that it was jury rigged.
[01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:20.220]  You know, I don't think there's any better way to put it
[01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:21.780]  but it was the best we could do
[01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:25.820]  with true inter-application communication
[01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:30.700]  or a system that's designed for it.
[01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:34.060]  If you're using app A
[01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:38.380]  and you want app A to send something to app B
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:40.620]  but you wanna keep going with app A,
[01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:42.700]  you just trigger the action.
[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:45.740]  It goes, maybe you get like a notification
[01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:48.500]  or something that it succeeded or failed
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:49.660]  but you don't leave.
[01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:51.620]  But with the callback URLs,
[01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:55.820]  you would, your actual iPhone would switch
[01:24:55.820 --> 01:24:58.940]  from app A to app B with the animation
[01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:00.060]  and the thing would happen
[01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:02.100]  and then it would, the opposite would happen
[01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:03.020]  and you'd go back to that.
[01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:04.620]  You'd see it happening.
[01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:05.540]  Yeah.
[01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:10.260]  Almost like watching a phantom user
[01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:13.260]  doing it automatically for you on screen.
[01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:15.940]  Yeah, it is very much like UI scripting
[01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:17.500]  to an extent where you have something
[01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:19.700]  that goes and presses this button, presses that button.
[01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:21.140]  Of course, it was better than that
[01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:22.500]  where you would just say to the app,
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.540]  hey, and like create this thing
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:26.460]  and do this action that you can do
[01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:28.820]  with the thing that you've just created please
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:30.780]  and then put the output of that
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:33.020]  into whatever you're sending back please.
[01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:35.300]  And if you did enough of them in a row
[01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:37.500]  and you saved workflow to do that,
[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:39.340]  your iPhone would just look like it was possessed
[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:40.260]  for a good couple of minutes
[01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:42.340]  as it bounced from here to there to back again
[01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:44.260]  and then over here and did this thing
[01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:45.860]  and then it all flipped around
[01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:47.220]  and went upside down and back to front
[01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:50.060]  and at some point you'd eventually end up
[01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:51.580]  back where you started,
[01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:54.140]  assuming that nothing crashed along the way.
[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:58.940]  There used to be utilities for the classic Mac
[01:25:58.940 --> 01:25:59.780]  that did stuff like that.
[01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:03.140]  I wanna say that one of them was quick keys.
[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:04.540]  Quick keys was a real thing.
[01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:06.620]  I'm not sure if quick keys was the one that did this,
[01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:10.700]  but that when you recorded what they called macros,
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:14.500]  it really was just like a phantom user playing your screen.
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:16.620]  You'd see the mouse pointer actually move,
[01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:18.460]  menus would actually come down.
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:21.860]  It was exactly like an invisible person
[01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:23.100]  was controlling your computer,
[01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:25.860]  but they could do it very fast.
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:27.260]  And it was still useful,
[01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:30.500]  but you could tell it was sort of a hack.
[01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:31.740]  This isn't the way it would be
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:33.740]  if it was built into the system.
[01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:36.540]  So when Apple acquired workflow,
[01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:38.620]  I realized as soon as they acquired it,
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:40.380]  well, I thought there's two possibilities.
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:44.900]  I thought A, either I vastly underestimated workflow
[01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:48.540]  and this is truly technology that is so amazing
[01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:52.060]  that Apple is actually going to build it into the system
[01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:55.980]  or B, it was just an aqua hire
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:58.700]  that they realized that the developers behind it
[01:26:58.700 --> 01:26:59.660]  were talented,
[01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:01.780]  but they wanted to hire them to do something else
[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:05.620]  and weren't going to allow them to keep workflow alive
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:07.020]  outside their work at Apple.
[01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:09.500]  But it turns out it was A and B.
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:12.940]  They did hire the team and many of them are still there,
[01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:14.620]  but the actual technology,
[01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:17.740]  it's not like, oh, we want you to remake workflow,
[01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:19.180]  but we'll do it officially this time.
[01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:22.260]  No, they actually, the roots of today's shortcuts
[01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:24.900]  is the third-party app workflow.
[01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:25.900]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:27.740]  And I bet the developers who did that
[01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:29.700]  are both very happy that it's still there
[01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:32.300]  and also at times cursing their past selves
[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:33.380]  for writing that bit of code.
[01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:34.620]  Why did you write that like that?
[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:35.580]  What were you thinking?
[01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:37.700]  Or at least that's what I do when I look at code.
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:38.780]  What idiot wrote this?
[01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:40.140]  Oh, that would be me.
[01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:41.700]  That's what happens all the time, isn't it?
[01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:43.820]  As somebody who's truly an expert on it though,
[01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:45.100]  do you think that the roots,
[01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:47.340]  those roots as a user of shortcuts
[01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:49.580]  and a creator of shortcuts still show
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:51.380]  that it wasn't? Yeah.
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:52.700]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:54.020]  Like how so?
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:57.620]  Well, to start with, it doesn't look that different.
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:59.940]  Obviously it's gone through iterations and changes
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:02.620]  and everything got squared off and rounded off again.
[01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:05.580]  And the menu on iPad has moved from the left side
[01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:07.380]  to the right side and things like that.
[01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:10.380]  But at its core, it's still your blocks
[01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:13.700]  with your actions in and variables that you put into that.
[01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:16.180]  And there's a line running from the top to the bottom.
[01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:17.620]  And this is a great little trick
[01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:18.780]  that a lot of people don't know about.
[01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:21.380]  There's a line that runs along the center of your actions,
[01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:23.220]  connecting one to the next one,
[01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:27.060]  unless you don't use the data from the previous action
[01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:30.020]  into the next action, at which point the line disappears.
[01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:32.620]  And then it starts again when you're taking data through.
[01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:35.260]  So that line is basically your flow of data,
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:36.900]  assuming that it's flowing from top to bottom,
[01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:38.620]  that's as complex as it gets.
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:40.740]  But I think it's still there.
[01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:42.900]  And I mean, they've probably rewritten that bit
[01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:45.700]  a number of times, most recently with the change to SwiftUI,
[01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:47.420]  but it's very much still there.
[01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:51.460]  And you can also tell if you look in the action section,
[01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:54.420]  there are a number of apps whose actions haven't changed
[01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:56.100]  in a very long time.
[01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:58.180]  And those are the actions that were there
[01:28:58.180 --> 01:28:59.780]  when this was workflow.
[01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:02.020]  I remember talking to some developers
[01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:04.300]  when Apple took over shortcuts
[01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:05.260]  and trying to find out
[01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:07.140]  how they were gonna update their actions.
[01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:08.300]  And the answer was basically
[01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:10.100]  they had to open a support ticket with Apple and say,
[01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:12.620]  hey, I'm writing my own shortcuts actions,
[01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:14.620]  can you remove the old ones please
[01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:16.180]  because I can't update those
[01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:18.860]  and they're pointing to an app that doesn't exist anymore.
[01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:22.260]  But there's still some of those actions in the app store.
[01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:25.340]  I think the tally from Agile Tortoise
[01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:27.140]  actually is still using the original actions.
[01:29:27.140 --> 01:29:28.220]  I may be wrong about that.
[01:29:28.220 --> 01:29:30.820]  So I'm sorry to Agile Tortoise if I have got that wrong.
[01:29:30.820 --> 01:29:34.700]  But WordPress, I'm pretty certain that action's not changed.
[01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:36.900]  The WordPress API does not change that fast.
[01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:39.860]  So there will be no reason for them to update it.
[01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:42.220]  And there's got to be some other ones in there as well.
[01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:45.580]  And some of them it's just you wouldn't necessarily notice
[01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:46.700]  if they did update,
[01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:48.620]  but I think some of them are still the same
[01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:50.100]  as they always were.
[01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:53.940]  And that is an interesting thing for an Apple product,
[01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:56.140]  especially today, but it's always been.
[01:29:56.140 --> 01:29:58.860]  Apple's never, and as the years have gone on,
[01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:02.100]  have included fewer and fewer third-party stuff
[01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:02.940]  in a default.
[01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:06.420]  Just take a new Apple product out of the Apple store
[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:10.580]  and unbox it, turn it on and use it right there.
[01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:12.860]  How much third-party stuff is there?
[01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:14.940]  Almost none at this point.
[01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:17.980]  But it used to be that they'd ship with a bunch of apps.
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:20.340]  They used to include apps from the Omni group.
[01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:25.340]  And before Safari, they included Internet Explorer built in,
[01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:28.420]  I mean, which is in hindsight, it seems,
[01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:31.180]  wow, that was a long time ago when they were,
[01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:35.420]  and it was controversial when they switched from baking
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:39.660]  or including Netscape as the default browser to IE.
[01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:44.660]  But yeah, Shortcuts still has third-party app actions
[01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:48.300]  in the default list because back in the day
[01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:51.660]  when it was third-party, that was the only way to do it
[01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:55.900]  because they could communicate by these callback URLs,
[01:30:55.900 --> 01:31:00.900]  but there was no way for an app like Drafts or things
[01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:06.540]  or whichever of the many apps that grew to embrace workflow
[01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:10.900]  for them to broadcast, here's the things you can do.
[01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:14.900]  So instead workflow built those things in
[01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:18.060]  and now they're still there for backwards compatibility.
[01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:20.240]  Yeah, yeah, exactly, because that was a problem
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:22.340]  that was had until relatively recently
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:25.560]  where you couldn't reuse a Shortcuts action
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:27.780]  and things had this problem, for example,
[01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:29.840]  because they have things for iPhone,
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:31.760]  things for iPad and things for Mac.
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:33.620]  Well, that's three things quite literally,
[01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:35.140]  which their name always amuses me.
[01:31:35.140 --> 01:31:36.620]  There are some great folks over there
[01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:38.160]  doing some wonderful work,
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:41.700]  but it meant that their Shortcuts actions didn't match.
[01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:44.360]  So if you ran your Shortcut on your iPhone,
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:46.740]  then to run that exact same Shortcut on your iPad,
[01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:48.760]  you had to either add an if statement and say,
[01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:52.040]  hey, if this is an iPad, run the iPad action instead,
[01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:54.880]  or install the iPhone app on your iPad
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:57.020]  to have Shortcuts interact with it.
[01:31:57.020 --> 01:31:58.880]  Unfortunately, they've now cleared that up
[01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.060]  and made that a lot easier,
[01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:01.940]  and that's part of the progress that they've gone down.
[01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:03.780]  And I'm sure the original workflow team
[01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:06.080]  actually worked with some of these app developers.
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:08.740]  I'm sure some of them have had contact with each other
[01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:09.940]  way back in the past saying,
[01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:11.500]  hey, by the way, I'm just adding
[01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:14.260]  all these new URL scheme supports into my app,
[01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:17.020]  so feel free to include them in workflow, please.
[01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:17.860]  Pretty please.
[01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:20.760]  But now it's the other way around where it is.
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:22.700]  App developers add something in their app
[01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:24.740]  and it's become a lot easier in iOS 16,
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:26.180]  which I'm really excited about.
[01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:27.900]  And then Shortcuts just picks it up,
[01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:30.420]  which means the first time that somebody new
[01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:31.540]  opens the Shortcuts app,
[01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:33.540]  assuming that they've got some of their favorite apps
[01:32:33.540 --> 01:32:35.720]  that they use regularly installed,
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:38.380]  they will see, especially in iOS 16,
[01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:39.820]  at the bottom of that folders list,
[01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:41.300]  they'll see Shortcuts from your apps,
[01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:44.060]  which will be recommended Shortcuts from your apps
[01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:47.180]  using App Actions and everything from that.
[01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:50.340]  And that, to me, is really the point
[01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:53.160]  that we've all been looking for and hoping for,
[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:54.860]  where you can take people
[01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:56.380]  who don't really know what they're doing,
[01:32:56.380 --> 01:32:57.740]  they don't know anything about programming,
[01:32:57.740 --> 01:32:59.220]  they don't know what Shortcuts is,
[01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:01.700]  they just know that, hey, this is the really,
[01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:03.820]  this is the way that I can add a quick button
[01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:05.340]  that will just do exactly what I need
[01:33:05.340 --> 01:33:07.820]  into the home screen of my iPhone,
[01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:09.660]  or I can add it as a back tap
[01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:11.020]  through an accessibility shortcut,
[01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:12.340]  or I can talk to it with Siri,
[01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:15.260]  and it will just do the thing that I want
[01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:18.380]  because it's been set up to do exactly that,
[01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:22.020]  which just makes your personal device actually personal.
[01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:24.620]  And I think that's the thing that we really want.
[01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:25.580]  Yep.
[01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:26.980]  All right, let me take a break here
[01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:29.200]  and thank our third and final sponsor of the show.
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:31.740]  New sponsor, Indochino.
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:34.060]  Hey, style isn't like math.
[01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:36.660]  There isn't one correct answer for everyone.
[01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:39.380]  It's all about finding what's right for you.
[01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:42.680]  Finding the perfect suit is impossible,
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:46.920]  but finding a suit that's perfect for you is simple,
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:48.460]  thanks to Indochino.
[01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:49.940]  You can choose your favorite fabric
[01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:51.060]  and customize every detail
[01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:53.380]  to find the look that's perfect for you.
[01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:56.180]  You can submit your measurements online, if you know them,
[01:33:56.180 --> 01:33:57.500]  and buy the whole suit
[01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:59.880]  right through Indochino's excellent website,
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:01.980]  or get measured in store.
[01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:04.260]  They have retail locations all over the place.
[01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:05.660]  They have one right here in Philadelphia
[01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:09.520]  that I've been to for a custom made for you fit
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:11.480]  at an incredible price.
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:13.300]  And with their fall collection,
[01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:15.340]  featuring new colors and premium fabrics,
[01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:19.240]  you'll be in style all season long.
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:22.300]  I visited their store here in Philadelphia.
[01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:24.060]  I have a couple of their dress shirts.
[01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:25.900]  They are excellent.
[01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:27.740]  Everything you want in a nice shirt,
[01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:29.900]  it just feels great, looks great.
[01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:32.360]  My wife and son, who have much better fashion sense than me,
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.780]  both vouch that I look very good in them.
[01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:36.340]  Whether you dress up a lot
[01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:38.360]  or you're looking for something semi-casual,
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:40.240]  Indochino has the stuff for you.
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:41.720]  The store, if you actually can,
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:43.320]  reach an Indochino retail store,
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:46.960]  very, very nice, very, very friendly and approachable.
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:48.540]  It is so super easy.
[01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:50.220]  It's just a really nice shopping experience,
[01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:51.760]  either online or in real life.
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:54.420]  And it's great to have the option to do both.
[01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:56.940]  Look, every Indochino, if you get a suit, a whole suit,
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:58.300]  it is made just for you.
[01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:00.600]  It is a tailored experience at a great price.
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:02.700]  You can design a suit that fits you perfectly
[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:04.260]  from the fabric to the cut.
[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:06.380]  And you can shop their made-for-you suits
[01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:09.540]  starting at just $449.
[01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:12.140]  And their premium fitted shirts
[01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:14.040]  are started at just 89 bucks.
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:17.020]  And you can fine tune every detail,
[01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:20.180]  the lapels, the linings, the monograms, and more.
[01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:22.060]  You get all the control over it that you want.
[01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:24.380]  It is not just buying a suit off a hanger
[01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:25.680]  and hoping that it fits.
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:26.900]  It is the opposite.
[01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:29.400]  Design your perfect suit with Indochino.
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:34.400]  To get 50 bucks off any purchase of $399 or more,
[01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:40.620]  use promo code TheTalkShow at Indochino.com.
[01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:46.260]  That's I-N-D-O-C-H-I-N-O dot com, Indochino.com.
[01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:52.460]  And just use that promo code TheTalkShow
[01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:55.980]  when you check out and you could save 50 bucks.
[01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:57.220]  My thanks to Indochino.
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:00.620]  So you talked about,
[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:02.820]  I know your book only covers up to iOS 15,
[01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:04.780]  but also the current version of macOS.
[01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:05.700]  But of course that's because
[01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:07.380]  the other operating systems aren't out yet.
[01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:10.420]  So anything else,
[01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:13.660]  so the big new thing in shortcuts for iOS 16
[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:15.500]  is this sort of,
[01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:18.940]  the way that third-party apps can broadcast,
[01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:20.060]  for lack of a better term,
[01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:23.060]  their shortcuts, built-in shortcuts capabilities,
[01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:25.420]  and shortcuts will pick them up.
[01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:26.240]  I agree with you.
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:28.460]  That is so super welcoming for new,
[01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:30.580]  it's great for anybody because it's convenient.
[01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:32.220]  Even if you're a long-time shortcuts user,
[01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:33.700]  it's like, okay, here's the stuff I need.
[01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:35.100]  It's right here.
[01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:36.960]  But if you're new, it's like you said,
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:38.500]  it's almost like now shortcuts,
[01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:40.300]  when you first launch it,
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:43.220]  looks more welcoming because it's like,
[01:36:43.220 --> 01:36:46.220]  yeah, here's these apps I use.
[01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:49.380]  Oh, and the actions are descriptive.
[01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:51.620]  I could say, oh, I would like to be able to automate that.
[01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:52.460]  Yeah.
[01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:53.900]  Even if they don't know necessarily
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:55.260]  that they're automating things, right?
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:57.340]  My parents have got shortcuts on their home screen.
[01:36:57.340 --> 01:36:58.980]  They don't really know what shortcuts is.
[01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:01.320]  They don't really care about automating things.
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:02.420]  But they wanted a way
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:04.080]  that when they use their blood pressure monitor,
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:06.760]  they can just tap a button and look into HealthKit.
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:09.140]  And now they've got it, thanks to shortcuts.
[01:37:09.140 --> 01:37:12.500]  And so having things like that pop up from apps
[01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:16.620]  that people actually use and want to use is really good.
[01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:20.540]  And I think it's just a way of bringing things
[01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:23.980]  closer together and better knit.
[01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:27.120]  Because the worst thing about Siri is like, I'm sorry,
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:29.220]  here are some web search results or whatever it is
[01:37:29.220 --> 01:37:30.940]  she actually says whenever she comes back with that.
[01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:34.100]  Because you said the thing that to you makes perfect sense.
[01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:37.200]  And of course that means that it should do A, B, and C.
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:38.600]  But it didn't understand that
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:39.920]  because the app developer gave it
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:41.840]  a completely different name and that's what's in Siri.
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:43.360]  Well, now you can set your own name
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:45.660]  so that whatever you think is the right way to say it,
[01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:46.740]  it doesn't matter whether or not
[01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:48.500]  that's what the app developer intended
[01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:50.700]  or whether that's the right way to do it.
[01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:52.260]  That's the way that your brain works
[01:37:52.260 --> 01:37:54.740]  and you can make your phone work the way your brain works
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:56.340]  instead of trying to make your brain work
[01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:59.100]  the way other people thought it should work.
[01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:01.980]  Which as we all know, there's a variety of neurotypical
[01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:05.100]  versus lots of neuroatypical ways out there.
[01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:07.200]  But even just regional variations
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:10.480]  of the way that we talk about things is really important.
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:12.800]  And being able to actually have an experience
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:16.000]  that when you look at your phone, it's there for you.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.620]  Your iPad serves your needs.
[01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:20.620]  Your Mac, when you right click on something in the Finder,
[01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:22.900]  shows you the actions that you need,
[01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:24.860]  not the ones that anybody else cares about,
[01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:25.960]  just the things that you need.
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:28.900]  Having that actually makes your device
[01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:30.180]  so much better for you.
[01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:34.420]  And you get to a point that I've tried to preach
[01:38:34.420 --> 01:38:36.820]  ever since I've been writing about automation stuff
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:39.300]  on Daring Fireball over the years
[01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:44.300]  and getting to the sort of, to me,
[01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:49.500]  fearful years before Apple acquired Workflow
[01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:53.340]  and officially said we're gonna bake this into the iOS
[01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:56.100]  where iOS didn't have any automation at all
[01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:57.820]  built from Apple in the system, right?
[01:38:57.820 --> 01:38:59.420]  And it was only the best we could do
[01:38:59.420 --> 01:39:02.060]  was the third-party thing and Workflow was the best.
[01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:03.760]  But it seemed from the outside
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:06.940]  that Apple had lost interest in automation.
[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:11.340]  And the only stuff on the Mac was all aging, right?
[01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:13.980]  AppleScript is a carryover from classic Mac OS.
[01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:15.800]  And like I said, it's almost a miracle
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:19.700]  that it's still here today and thriving
[01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:21.380]  in the way that it still is.
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:23.260]  But I don't think anybody,
[01:39:23.260 --> 01:39:28.260]  when Mac OS X originally shipped in 2002, I think,
[01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:33.380]  2001, 2002, what are the technologies from classic Mac OS
[01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:36.460]  that carried over into the first version of Mac OS X
[01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:38.740]  that will still be there 20 years later?
[01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:41.060]  There would not have been many bets on AppleScript,
[01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:41.960]  but here we are.
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:43.900]  And AppleScript hadn't gotten improved.
[01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:46.900]  And I guess the hope for people like me and you
[01:39:46.900 --> 01:39:49.340]  and your colleague, David Sparks,
[01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:50.780]  and everybody else who loves it
[01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:52.740]  was that Apple was gonna come out with it.
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:54.820]  The reason they hadn't been updating AppleScript
[01:39:54.820 --> 01:39:56.680]  was that they had something in the works
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:59.700]  and it's here's the new thing and it's SwiftScript
[01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:02.300]  or whatever you want it, whatever name it could have been.
[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:04.500]  And it's an all new scripting system.
[01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:07.940]  I mean, we could still long for a new scripting system,
[01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:10.180]  honestly, but that's a separate conversation.
[01:40:10.180 --> 01:40:14.260]  But the fact that Apple's most popular platform,
[01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:16.980]  arguably the most popular platform in the world,
[01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:19.940]  iOS, didn't have automation,
[01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:21.820]  made it seem like Apple thought it wasn't.
[01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:24.300]  And the thinking of, well, why wouldn't they want it?
[01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:26.180]  And the idea would be the argument,
[01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:29.000]  and it's oft repeated, even by people who wish they would,
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.980]  but who are cynical and say, yeah, of course they're not,
[01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:34.960]  because most people aren't going to use it.
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:38.340]  And my argument against that has always been,
[01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:40.300]  yes, that is absolutely true.
[01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:42.700]  And in the earlier days of computing,
[01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:46.060]  like the HyperCard era and going back even further,
[01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:50.700]  like when you buy an Apple II in the 80s
[01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:52.760]  and you just turned it on, what did you get?
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:56.100]  You got a prompt where you could just type basic programs.
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:40:59.240]  You could just start typing programs
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:01.340]  when you turn the computer on.
[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:04.180]  The idea back then that slowly faded away
[01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:07.140]  was that everybody, if given the right tools
[01:41:07.140 --> 01:41:10.660]  and the right approach to it, could be a programmer
[01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:13.540]  and would want to be a programmer to some extent.
[01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:15.820]  And that's just not true.
[01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:17.300]  We know that now.
[01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:18.340]  No, we really do.
[01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:21.420]  The number of people who are required to use a computer
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:24.480]  to do their job and then come out with the absolutely
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:27.060]  stellar line of I'm not a computer person.
[01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:28.960]  When you ask them to do something as simple as
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:30.940]  have you tried turning it off and turning it back on again,
[01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:32.140]  it's astounding.
[01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:34.820]  It's slightly terrifying because basically,
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:36.960]  if they're saying, hey, I'm not a computer person,
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:38.440]  when they're asked to do something with the computer
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:39.600]  that's required for part of their job,
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:41.060]  they're basically saying, I can't do my job.
[01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:43.340]  And that's just like, whoa, okay, I didn't realize
[01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:45.860]  that we were voicing personal thoughts like this today.
[01:41:45.860 --> 01:41:47.400]  I'll get you some chocolate to go with this.
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:48.580]  Do we need to have a sit down?
[01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:50.620]  But the number of people who just go,
[01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:52.060]  no, I don't want to automate things.
[01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:53.940]  But people actually do.
[01:41:53.940 --> 01:41:55.980]  They just don't know it under the name
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:56.940]  that we're talking about it.
[01:41:56.940 --> 01:41:59.500]  And it's really difficult sometimes to put things
[01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:00.980]  in a way that other people understand
[01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:04.140]  because they're not looking for an automated solution.
[01:42:04.140 --> 01:42:06.600]  What they want is that when they talk to Siri,
[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:09.140]  instead of using reminders, it uses this app
[01:42:09.140 --> 01:42:11.800]  that they found that they've been using with their spouse
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:13.620]  because that's a great place to store groceries
[01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:15.840]  because it means that whenever they go to the grocery store,
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:17.680]  they actually end up with the things that they need
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:19.740]  instead of six bottles of ketchup and no peanut butter
[01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:22.680]  or whatever it is that their household problem is.
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:25.900]  And they just want their device to actually be integrated
[01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:27.100]  into their lives.
[01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:30.100]  And that's, I think, why Shortcuts is called Shortcuts
[01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:31.860]  rather than Automator.
[01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:34.940]  Because it is about putting a shortcut
[01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:36.620]  where you're looking for the thing
[01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:38.360]  to the thing that you actually want.
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:40.980]  And they started out on iOS with Siri Intents, right?
[01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:42.300]  So that you could add something
[01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:45.140]  to your preferred task manager using Siri.
[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:46.780]  But that's always been kind of flaky.
[01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:48.380]  And I don't know why that is,
[01:42:48.380 --> 01:42:51.060]  but I've tried it with so many different apps
[01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:54.500]  and this is where you've got the problem of naming, right?
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:56.860]  Because OmniFocus is a lovely unique name.
[01:42:56.860 --> 01:42:58.360]  When Siri understands it,
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:00.740]  Things is a bit confusing for Siri.
[01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:04.320]  And Jew, it asks you when you want it to be done by.
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:05.340]  Like, what's the deadline?
[01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:06.700]  It's like, no, I don't want a deadline.
[01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:07.860]  I just want you to...
[01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:10.380]  Like I said, Tuesday at 9 p.m., please just do it.
[01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:11.380]  But whatever it is, you know,
[01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:12.880]  Siri's always been a bit flaky on that.
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:15.780]  But by adding the Shortcuts support,
[01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:17.900]  then it really just puts things hopefully
[01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:19.380]  in the place where you're using it
[01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:22.120]  and where you can find something that when you say it,
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:25.540]  makes sense for you and is understood by your device.
[01:43:25.540 --> 01:43:27.660]  That is so true, I know we keep coming back
[01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:32.300]  to really good names, but that fail for other reasons.
[01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:36.820]  And I've been a user of Dew, D-U-E,
[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:38.540]  I think since like the original version.
[01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:40.620]  I just have a couple of weekly reminders in there,
[01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:41.860]  like to take out the trash
[01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:44.340]  and when it's time at the beginning of the week
[01:43:44.340 --> 01:43:46.540]  to change my weekly sponsor.
[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:47.380]  Yeah.
[01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:50.740]  That I've been running in Dew for, I don't know,
[01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:51.660]  a dozen years.
[01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:53.100]  It is very confusing.
[01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:56.660]  In addition to Google search ability, yes,
[01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:59.760]  Siri confusion is natural, right?
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:03.620]  And especially you're talking about creating a reminder
[01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:08.620]  and of course there's, it just doesn't work.
[01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:10.300]  Yeah.
[01:44:10.300 --> 01:44:12.500]  And also like you've got things like Todoist, okay,
[01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:14.780]  which is obviously Todoist.
[01:44:14.780 --> 01:44:17.100]  And then occasionally Siri comes out with Todoist.
[01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:17.940]  Yeah.
[01:44:17.940 --> 01:44:19.100]  Oh, that's cute, well done.
[01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:22.260]  Like thanks computer, that's a new one for today.
[01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:23.700]  Like Siri mispronouncing things,
[01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:25.100]  honestly, it's one of my favorite things.
[01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:28.700]  I was driving back with my parents from France last weekend.
[01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:32.020]  And so of course my parents, my dad in particular
[01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:33.780]  doesn't speak very good French at all.
[01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:37.300]  And so he has his Siri naturally set to English.
[01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:40.100]  Okay, but you would think driving in France
[01:44:40.100 --> 01:44:41.580]  that Siri could, I don't know,
[01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:45.460]  use French Siri for the street names.
[01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:49.460]  No, no, no, there were some, oh my God.
[01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:51.340]  Just complete butchering.
[01:44:51.340 --> 01:44:53.460]  Reading everything, even something,
[01:44:53.460 --> 01:44:55.260]  somebody who doesn't know French very well
[01:44:55.260 --> 01:44:57.420]  would at least try to pronounce the French way.
[01:44:57.420 --> 01:45:00.380]  Reading it just brutally is English.
[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:01.220]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:02.300]  And I don't think I can even do it
[01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:03.420]  because I do speak French.
[01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:05.340]  And so I don't think I can even pronounce the things
[01:45:05.340 --> 01:45:06.380]  the way that Siri was saying it,
[01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:08.340]  but oh my gosh, that was terrible.
[01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:10.220]  But you know, it is very difficult.
[01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:13.220]  How do you explain to a computer how to sound things out?
[01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:15.220]  And there's the whole phonetic alphabet and so on,
[01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:17.420]  but then do you expect every app developer
[01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:21.100]  to know the phonetic alphabet to put that in somewhere
[01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:22.140]  so that they can do that?
[01:45:22.140 --> 01:45:24.180]  And then do you expect every user
[01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:26.540]  to know that Zapier rhymes with happier
[01:45:26.540 --> 01:45:30.060]  instead of being Zapier that rhymes with papier?
[01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:32.060]  I don't know, I'm making up words here.
[01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:34.380]  But you know, like knowing how to pronounce
[01:45:34.380 --> 01:45:38.460]  the name of the app, that's a really big barrier to entry
[01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:41.380]  because how many people have said a word wrong
[01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:42.540]  because they learned it by reading?
[01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:45.620]  Like I used to pronounce the word picturesque
[01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:47.580]  because if you look at it, that's what it is.
[01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:49.580]  And I learned it from reading in a book.
[01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:52.020]  And it wasn't until ages later that my mom was like,
[01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:54.100]  oh, you mean picturesque.
[01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:57.140]  And I'm like, oh no, that's a word I've been mispronouncing
[01:45:57.140 --> 01:45:58.620]  for a couple of years now, whoops.
[01:45:58.620 --> 01:46:02.020]  Rosemary, you're describing the entire bane
[01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:05.060]  of my decades-long podcasting existence.
[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:10.260]  And my parents are well-spoken.
[01:46:10.260 --> 01:46:14.220]  It's just that I, as an extremely avid reader,
[01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:19.500]  encountered so many words that my parents,
[01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:21.620]  we just weren't used and weren't used
[01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:23.260]  on the TV shows we watched.
[01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:26.140]  And so I just made up my own pronunciations
[01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:29.420]  and they're all burned into my brain.
[01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:32.020]  Yep, yep, and it happens to everyone, right?
[01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:33.860]  But you look up an app on the App Store
[01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:36.660]  and then you think, oh cool, I know how that's pronounced.
[01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:40.820]  Obviously, this is Instagram, Facebook, OneDrive.
[01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:42.060]  Okay, cool.
[01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:43.740]  And then you get some other ones like Achoo,
[01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:45.940]  which is a great app for the developer of Apollo
[01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:48.740]  that lets you view the HTML and Safari on your iPhone.
[01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:51.940]  But for me, as a native English speaker, Achoo,
[01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:53.060]  like that's logical.
[01:46:53.060 --> 01:46:54.620]  I've seen Robin Hood Men in Tights.
[01:46:54.620 --> 01:46:56.460]  I know how this is pronounced.
[01:46:56.460 --> 01:46:58.780]  Non-native speaker, good luck, you know,
[01:46:58.780 --> 01:46:59.900]  and that's nothing against Chrissy.
[01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:01.300]  She's done a great job there, like, you know,
[01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:04.140]  but Airbnb, like a number of times
[01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:07.660]  that I've had to explain to non-native speakers of English
[01:47:07.660 --> 01:47:10.520]  that T's and C's means terms and conditions
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:12.700]  because they hear T's and C's on the advert
[01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:15.220]  and they're thinking like T as in T-E-A
[01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:19.660]  as in like the drink or T as in T-E-E, the golf tee.
[01:47:19.660 --> 01:47:20.940]  Okay, and then C's.
[01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:23.420]  Okay, is it like C's as in like I-C
[01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:26.780]  or is it C as in an ocean and there's just like,
[01:47:26.780 --> 01:47:27.820]  and then actually it turns out
[01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:29.060]  it's something completely different, right?
[01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:31.840]  And it's very difficult to figure out
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:32.780]  how you pronounce these things.
[01:47:32.780 --> 01:47:34.940]  Like, is it Amex or Amex?
[01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:35.780]  Mm-hmm.
[01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:36.620]  Yeah.
[01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:37.660]  Yep, yep, that's a perfect example.
[01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:39.260]  And both of them are right and both of them are wrong.
[01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:41.300]  I'm sure the folks at American Express
[01:47:41.300 --> 01:47:43.380]  have their own personal internal guidelines
[01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:44.940]  as to how this should be pronounced.
[01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:46.300]  And then every one of us will say it
[01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:47.320]  ever so slightly differently.
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:48.900]  And it's just really difficult
[01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:51.460]  to actually interact with your device in a way
[01:47:51.460 --> 01:47:53.160]  that especially if you're using your voice
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:54.800]  and a lot of people like to use their voice
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:55.940]  to interact with their devices.
[01:47:55.940 --> 01:47:57.980]  It's a lot more common than a lot of us nerds
[01:47:57.980 --> 01:47:58.820]  would like to think.
[01:47:58.820 --> 01:48:00.500]  A lot of us nerds are very reticient
[01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:01.980]  when it comes to talking to our devices
[01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:03.340]  and we think, no, it's faster to type.
[01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:05.700]  I'm just gonna do that because it'll be right.
[01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:08.360]  And we get around our devices pretty quickly.
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:11.180]  But I'm there sitting there with my parents in the evening
[01:48:11.180 --> 01:48:14.000]  and my dad thinks of something and asks us
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.400]  and we go, oh, I don't know.
[01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:18.580]  And he goes, hey, Apple lady, what does this say?
[01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:20.100]  And she comes back with web results
[01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:21.660]  and he's fine with that to be clear.
[01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:23.300]  Like he actually doesn't mind them at all
[01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:24.980]  because she'll read out like the first sentence
[01:48:24.980 --> 01:48:25.960]  of the first web result.
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:29.020]  And honestly, it seems like nine out of 10 times
[01:48:29.020 --> 01:48:31.540]  when he's actually talking instead of like half
[01:48:31.540 --> 01:48:33.200]  not paying attention to what he's saying
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:34.100]  that she gets it right
[01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:35.960]  and gives him the answer that he's looking for.
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:38.060]  But she has to be able to understand for that.
[01:48:38.060 --> 01:48:41.780]  And when you're using words that are difficult to pronounce
[01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:44.500]  or nobody knows what their right pronunciation is
[01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:46.700]  or the meaning isn't clear
[01:48:46.700 --> 01:48:48.780]  and number of words that sound the same
[01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:50.180]  and mean totally different things in English
[01:48:50.180 --> 01:48:51.900]  is stupidly large.
[01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:53.100]  Our language is terrible.
[01:48:54.940 --> 01:48:57.700]  I always personally think that English was the revenge
[01:48:57.700 --> 01:49:00.780]  on those coming to invade Britain back in the day
[01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:04.180]  because we had Latin and then the Vikings came.
[01:49:04.180 --> 01:49:06.260]  And so we butchered some German in there
[01:49:06.260 --> 01:49:08.740]  and then the French came and we were like, oh no,
[01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:10.260]  we're really gonna mess with these guys.
[01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:13.100]  They love their language, we're really gonna butcher this.
[01:49:13.100 --> 01:49:13.980]  That's the result.
[01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:15.880]  But it means that communicating through voice
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:17.220]  is incredibly difficult.
[01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:21.220]  And when my words go up at the end of a sentence,
[01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:24.200]  that's a question, which to you and me
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:25.560]  is something that's very logical
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:27.480]  and easy to understand perhaps.
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:29.700]  But to somebody who's not a native speaker of English
[01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:31.980]  where that upwards intonation
[01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:35.260]  doesn't necessarily mean a question, that's very difficult.
[01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:37.700]  And just because I've done an upwards intonation
[01:49:37.700 --> 01:49:40.300]  should Siri automatically attempt to interpret that
[01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:41.220]  as a question?
[01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:42.180]  Yeah, that's a good one.
[01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:43.460]  Because I can hear it.
[01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:45.260]  I took high school Spanish for four years
[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:46.860]  and forgot 90% of it.
[01:49:46.860 --> 01:49:47.680]  I was terrible.
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:48.860]  I just do not have a mind
[01:49:48.860 --> 01:49:50.580]  that takes to learning a second language.
[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:52.820]  But I can tell when like a Spanish speaker
[01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:56.620]  or French speaker, Italian, the Romance languages
[01:49:56.620 --> 01:49:59.660]  are asking a question because there's a lilt to it.
[01:49:59.660 --> 01:50:02.960]  But there's a lot of languages where if I'm listening
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:06.320]  to someone in a movie or something speak the language,
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:08.180]  I can't even tell when they're asking a question.
[01:50:08.180 --> 01:50:11.620]  It just isn't, let alone understand the words.
[01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:13.140]  I guess my main point though,
[01:50:13.140 --> 01:50:14.980]  and going back to that example with your parents
[01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:19.580]  is that my pro, this is why even a company
[01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:23.220]  with as broad a reach as Apple,
[01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:27.820]  making computers that they really mean to be for everyone
[01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:31.660]  and with iOS have truly achieved it, right?
[01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:34.680]  It's the platform that longtime Apple people
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:36.660]  had always hoped that Apple would have
[01:50:36.660 --> 01:50:38.780]  is the one that reaches the mass market,
[01:50:38.780 --> 01:50:41.160]  the actual computer for the rest of us.
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:44.600]  The one that all these people who for years and years
[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:48.420]  before iPhones, we'd say, I swear you should ditch that
[01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:51.860]  and they'd gripe about their PC, you should get a Mac.
[01:50:51.860 --> 01:50:55.980]  And really not like in a religious cult of Mac way,
[01:50:55.980 --> 01:50:58.080]  but just seriously, the problems you're having,
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:00.540]  you don't have to reinstall the operating system every year
[01:51:00.540 --> 01:51:02.860]  on the Mac, you should just get it and it'll just sit there
[01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:06.100]  and you could do the simple email and web
[01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:08.040]  and printing some stuff when you need to print
[01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:09.840]  and it'll actually print, don't.
[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:10.680]  Yes.
[01:51:11.740 --> 01:51:14.820]  iOS is that platform and they have this tremendous reach,
[01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:17.180]  but why should they still care about automation
[01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:19.060]  if most people aren't going to use it?
[01:51:19.060 --> 01:51:23.100]  A, there's the, hey, more people should be using it.
[01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:23.940]  Yes.
[01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:24.820]  If they would just try it.
[01:51:24.820 --> 01:51:26.940]  And your book is such a great way to do it.
[01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:30.460]  But then the secondary reason that's downhill from that,
[01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:33.860]  one level down, is that even if most people
[01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:38.860]  don't create their own shortcuts or Apple scripts
[01:51:39.980 --> 01:51:42.800]  or keyboard maestro macros or whatever,
[01:51:44.020 --> 01:51:46.700]  they can share them with others.
[01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:50.020]  And somebody can be the person who didn't create it,
[01:51:50.020 --> 01:51:52.780]  even if they could have, but they didn't want to try.
[01:51:52.780 --> 01:51:54.860]  But like a small team of people,
[01:51:54.860 --> 01:51:59.540]  like if there's a rotating crew of six people
[01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:03.980]  collaborate on the podcast and there's some steps
[01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:06.300]  of the process that can be automated.
[01:52:06.300 --> 01:52:08.880]  And that is, as everybody who makes podcasts know,
[01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:11.980]  there are definitely some steps that can be automated.
[01:52:11.980 --> 01:52:14.780]  All it takes is for one of the people on the team
[01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:18.300]  to make the custom automation that could be a shortcut
[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:22.340]  and share it with the rest of the team
[01:52:22.340 --> 01:52:23.980]  and everybody else can use it,
[01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:25.900]  even if they wouldn't have created it themselves.
[01:52:25.900 --> 01:52:29.140]  And they never, like a team of six or of three
[01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:30.980]  or a team of one, right?
[01:52:30.980 --> 01:52:33.140]  I have so many automations for myself.
[01:52:33.140 --> 01:52:35.460]  But if you're sharing it with just a small number of people,
[01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:36.300]  they can do that.
[01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:39.620]  And then you can get on things like the Reddit
[01:52:39.620 --> 01:52:41.580]  or individual apps.
[01:52:41.580 --> 01:52:45.340]  Most popular third-party apps have successful,
[01:52:45.340 --> 01:52:47.500]  thriving user communities.
[01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:50.260]  Keyboard maestro certainly has a really good one.
[01:52:50.260 --> 01:52:54.340]  And you can just hang out there and look for like
[01:52:54.340 --> 01:52:56.580]  the subject of a thread that catches your eye,
[01:52:56.580 --> 01:52:58.300]  like, oh, that sounds like something I might use
[01:52:58.300 --> 01:52:59.260]  and click into it.
[01:52:59.260 --> 01:53:01.700]  And somebody describes you like, hey, I would use that.
[01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:04.140]  And there it is for you to download and use.
[01:53:04.140 --> 01:53:05.800]  You don't have to make it yourself.
[01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:09.800]  But if it had to be a full standalone app,
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:11.000]  you would never make it.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.220]  It would be too much work.
[01:53:12.220 --> 01:53:14.340]  Wouldn't be worth the effort.
[01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:17.500]  But through these automation technologies,
[01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:20.380]  shortcuts, keyboard maestro,
[01:53:20.380 --> 01:53:22.000]  which I can't sing the praises of enough,
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.540]  but would require a whole nother show.
[01:53:23.540 --> 01:53:28.540]  At least these things have more consumers
[01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:32.060]  of the macros or scripts or workflows or shortcuts,
[01:53:32.060 --> 01:53:33.980]  whatever you want to call the output.
[01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:38.980]  There's more consumers of them whose lives are improved,
[01:53:39.740 --> 01:53:42.940]  whether it's for fun or for work or whatever,
[01:53:42.940 --> 01:53:44.900]  then there are creators of them.
[01:53:44.900 --> 01:53:47.700]  That's, and I don't think that will ever change.
[01:53:47.700 --> 01:53:50.300]  And that to me is the,
[01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:52.580]  it was like one of those like moments where it's like,
[01:53:52.580 --> 01:53:55.740]  ma, and you hear like this great music.
[01:53:55.740 --> 01:53:58.260]  When Apple's confirmed that shortcuts
[01:53:58.260 --> 01:54:00.520]  was going to be built into iOS, it was like, yes,
[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:03.380]  this is going to get better every year.
[01:54:03.380 --> 01:54:05.820]  This is, there's a future for this.
[01:54:05.820 --> 01:54:06.780]  And it really is.
[01:54:06.780 --> 01:54:10.900]  And as we wrap up, any other new stuff in iOS 16
[01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:14.540]  or macOS Ventura for shortcuts that's caught your attention?
[01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:16.920]  I mean, the thing that caught my attention first
[01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:20.860]  was the fact that actually they sure locked some shortcuts
[01:54:20.860 --> 01:54:21.700]  that people were doing,
[01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:23.500]  specifically shortcuts automations.
[01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:26.060]  I had automations for every focus mode,
[01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:29.400]  which was customizing my background image
[01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:30.880]  and changing my watch face.
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:31.880]  And you know what?
[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:34.660]  It's built into the focus modes now in the settings.
[01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:37.620]  And I am really glad because that means that Apple
[01:54:37.620 --> 01:54:40.820]  is realizing that, hey, people are doing this stuff.
[01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:43.060]  Let's make it even easier for them.
[01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:44.940]  And that's not saying that, you know, shortcuts,
[01:54:44.940 --> 01:54:47.520]  I want shortcuts to disappear, far from it,
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:48.900]  but I'm really glad that they're watching
[01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:50.980]  what people are doing with this,
[01:54:50.980 --> 01:54:53.140]  taking that information and then making it available
[01:54:53.140 --> 01:54:55.580]  to everybody once they realize that this is stuff
[01:54:55.580 --> 01:54:57.420]  that people want to do, because that means
[01:54:57.420 --> 01:54:59.600]  that they're actually watching shortcuts, right?
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:01.020]  That means that they're looking at it and going,
[01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:02.940]  hey, there's some of the stuff that people are using.
[01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:03.780]  That's cool.
[01:55:03.780 --> 01:55:05.820]  Okay, we'll put that into the main operating system.
[01:55:05.820 --> 01:55:07.300]  Like, we'll just put it right there.
[01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:08.680]  Thanks, love it.
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:10.100]  And then they've taken that further
[01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:12.640]  and put more focus mode automations in
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:14.620]  and put them inside shortcuts as well
[01:55:14.620 --> 01:55:18.220]  so that you can actually like change your tab group
[01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:21.460]  in Safari through the focus mode that's activated,
[01:55:21.460 --> 01:55:23.740]  but you can also then change it further.
[01:55:23.740 --> 01:55:26.920]  So if, like me, you record more than one podcast,
[01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:30.100]  as an example, and you have a podcasting focus mode,
[01:55:30.100 --> 01:55:31.860]  when your podcasting focus mode starts,
[01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:34.300]  you can have a shortcut automation that will go,
[01:55:34.300 --> 01:55:36.560]  hey, I'm gonna check your calendar a second.
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:37.900]  Looks like you're recording.
[01:55:37.900 --> 01:55:39.400]  Actually, you're on the talk show today
[01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:41.100]  talking to John Gruber, how wonderful.
[01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:44.060]  So I'm gonna put you into the guest subversion
[01:55:44.060 --> 01:55:45.300]  of your podcasting focus mode,
[01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:48.100]  which means I'm gonna activate this Safari to app group.
[01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:50.220]  And I'm gonna change your background to that
[01:55:50.220 --> 01:55:52.940]  instead of your standard podcasting one and so on.
[01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:56.780]  And that to me is really where they're giving and taking.
[01:55:56.780 --> 01:55:59.540]  And there's that beautiful symbiotic relationship
[01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:02.460]  of they're seeing what people do and pulling that out.
[01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:03.740]  And then they're putting in more stuff
[01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:06.540]  to see what other people do and building on it from there.
[01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:08.980]  And we're getting this lovely snowball effect
[01:56:08.980 --> 01:56:11.100]  of where things are building on it.
[01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:12.900]  And it's really great that folks,
[01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:15.480]  like the team on the artwork stuff,
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:18.060]  they've added back in mail merge.
[01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:19.580]  They've made mail merge really great.
[01:56:19.580 --> 01:56:20.940]  Like there's proper support
[01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:23.140]  for like filling in from spreadsheets and stuff,
[01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:25.220]  but like numbers and so on on iOS.
[01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:26.580]  So I can do this on my iPhone.
[01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:28.920]  And that is coming back in.
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:31.780]  And I think a good chunk of why that's coming back
[01:56:31.780 --> 01:56:34.720]  is because of this vocal minority
[01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:37.020]  who's got into shortcuts and automation and stuff
[01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:39.420]  and realized that actually that's what they need.
[01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:40.420]  And that's great.
[01:56:40.420 --> 01:56:43.740]  And I'm just really excited by all of this
[01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:45.440]  and hoping that we're gonna get
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:47.100]  an automations tab on the Mac.
[01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:50.420]  I know that you can automate shortcuts on the Mac
[01:56:50.420 --> 01:56:52.880]  in so many other ways, but it's not as user-friendly.
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:56.380]  And I think the big advantage that shortcuts has
[01:56:56.380 --> 01:56:58.340]  is it's a pretty app.
[01:56:58.340 --> 01:57:02.020]  It doesn't look like something that when you open it up,
[01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:04.720]  you're gonna break your Mac with it.
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:07.500]  You probably could if you tried hard enough,
[01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:09.160]  but the built-in security controls
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:11.400]  are gonna try and stop you doing that.
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:12.900]  But it does look nice and friendly.
[01:57:12.900 --> 01:57:14.860]  And I think adding an automations tab into that
[01:57:14.860 --> 01:57:16.220]  and maybe at some point in the future,
[01:57:16.220 --> 01:57:18.260]  this honestly, John, is my biggest wish.
[01:57:18.260 --> 01:57:20.420]  The gallery inside of shortcuts,
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:23.780]  let there be shortcuts developers.
[01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:25.220]  Like don't let us charge for it.
[01:57:25.220 --> 01:57:26.180]  I'm fine with that.
[01:57:26.180 --> 01:57:28.000]  I'll quite happily make and submit stuff
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.900]  and have it go through a proper review process for free.
[01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:32.260]  Like I don't mind doing that.
[01:57:32.260 --> 01:57:33.700]  I'm happy to do that,
[01:57:33.700 --> 01:57:36.120]  but I would love to get way more shortcuts examples
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:38.300]  into the gallery because things like,
[01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:41.340]  hey, you have a non-health kit blood pressure monitor
[01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:44.100]  and you wanna be able to lock that stuff in health.
[01:57:44.100 --> 01:57:46.220]  Well, that's a shortcut that a whole bunch of people
[01:57:46.220 --> 01:57:48.460]  could use and take advantage of.
[01:57:48.460 --> 01:57:49.380]  And that would be great.
[01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:50.480]  And I've already built that.
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:52.420]  It's on my parents' iPhone home screens
[01:57:52.420 --> 01:57:53.620]  in their health folders,
[01:57:53.620 --> 01:57:55.080]  because that's where they find apps.
[01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:55.920]  And that works.
[01:57:55.920 --> 01:57:57.140]  And I've done the same thing for scales
[01:57:57.140 --> 01:57:58.900]  for other people and so on and so forth.
[01:57:58.900 --> 01:58:00.180]  All of those sorts of things,
[01:58:00.180 --> 01:58:02.220]  they're really simple little shortcuts.
[01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:03.140]  But as you said,
[01:58:03.140 --> 01:58:05.460]  there's a lot of people out there who won't create them.
[01:58:05.460 --> 01:58:07.700]  So if the gallery became even bigger,
[01:58:07.700 --> 01:58:09.140]  that's my hope for, I don't know,
[01:58:09.140 --> 01:58:12.420]  maybe 16.1, 16.3, four,
[01:58:12.420 --> 01:58:14.300]  whenever they do that big update mid-year,
[01:58:14.300 --> 01:58:15.620]  I would love them to do that.
[01:58:15.620 --> 01:58:18.220]  I know that they'd have to have like an entire review team
[01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:20.300]  who hopefully actually understand shortcuts,
[01:58:20.300 --> 01:58:22.420]  unlike some of the folks at the App Store review
[01:58:22.420 --> 01:58:23.600]  who currently don't understand
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:25.920]  what a status bar application is.
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:28.420]  That's been a fun conversation back and forth with like,
[01:58:28.420 --> 01:58:29.660]  no, it's a status bar application.
[01:58:29.660 --> 01:58:31.140]  When you close it, it's supposed to disappear.
[01:58:31.140 --> 01:58:31.980]  We swear.
[01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:32.800]  No, it's not.
[01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:33.880]  But yes, if they could do that,
[01:58:33.880 --> 01:58:35.680]  and if they could add that back in,
[01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:37.360]  that would be, or add that in,
[01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:38.800]  because it used to be that you could submit stuff
[01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:39.700]  to the gallery.
[01:58:39.700 --> 01:58:41.300]  I think some of the things in the gallery
[01:58:41.300 --> 01:58:43.000]  actually might have been things that I submitted
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.620]  way back when this was Workflow,
[01:58:44.620 --> 01:58:46.980]  but there's some stuff in there that's really great,
[01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:48.140]  and some stuff in there that's like,
[01:58:48.140 --> 01:58:52.500]  oh, this has been in here for a very long time,
[01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:53.780]  like a really long time.
[01:58:53.780 --> 01:58:56.900]  I remember this from way, way back when.
[01:58:56.900 --> 01:58:59.200]  And yeah, it just feels like that area
[01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:00.900]  could do with some love so that more people
[01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:04.140]  would be able to discover more useful things
[01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:06.740]  that are built into their phone that they can do.
[01:59:06.740 --> 01:59:09.340]  Yeah, to sort of benefit downwind
[01:59:09.340 --> 01:59:10.740]  from the creations of others.
[01:59:10.740 --> 01:59:14.460]  And it's great, and it really is a sign
[01:59:14.460 --> 01:59:18.180]  that it's not just a fringe group at Apple
[01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:21.020]  who sort of snuck shortcuts in,
[01:59:21.020 --> 01:59:24.960]  but that the whole platform's team is serious about it,
[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:27.140]  that they have the gallery in the first place
[01:59:27.140 --> 01:59:31.020]  so that you can share these through the iCloud gallery
[01:59:31.020 --> 01:59:34.700]  to people, and they can install them.
[01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:37.740]  You can imagine, on the Mac, this sounds ridiculous,
[01:59:37.740 --> 01:59:39.900]  because of course you could just put them on your website
[01:59:39.900 --> 01:59:42.060]  and people could download them and double-click them,
[01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:44.120]  and then they'd go to the right place.
[01:59:44.120 --> 01:59:46.020]  But on iOS, that's a problem.
[01:59:46.020 --> 01:59:48.300]  If you just want to benefit from a shortcut
[01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:50.860]  written by somebody else, how do you reproduce it?
[01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:55.460]  If you can't just download it or copy and paste it,
[01:59:55.460 --> 01:59:57.100]  you can't, because it's not text,
[01:59:57.100 --> 01:59:58.500]  it's not a scripting language.
[01:59:58.500 --> 02:00:00.960]  You can't just say, select this text on the webpage
[02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:02.580]  and paste it into Script Editor
[02:00:02.580 --> 02:00:03.900]  like you can with AppleScript.
[02:00:03.900 --> 02:00:05.580]  So the gallery's great that it exists,
[02:00:05.580 --> 02:00:09.420]  but there's probably a thousand ways it could be better.
[02:00:09.420 --> 02:00:11.860]  And even with stuff like the editorial guns,
[02:00:11.860 --> 02:00:13.820]  where they can say, shortcut of the day
[02:00:13.820 --> 02:00:16.800]  and highlight really interesting ones.
[02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:19.140]  Yeah, yeah, they've been doing a whole series
[02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:21.660]  on the Mac App Store of shortcuts things.
[02:00:21.660 --> 02:00:25.300]  They've had Federico Vittucci, David Sparks, and so on.
[02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:27.260]  And yeah, I'm loving that they're doing that.
[02:00:27.260 --> 02:00:29.420]  And I've talked to some of the folks
[02:00:29.420 --> 02:00:31.780]  at the editorial team at Apple in the past,
[02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:33.940]  and they're lovely folks working really hard.
[02:00:33.940 --> 02:00:36.140]  It's a much smaller team than folks might think as well,
[02:00:36.140 --> 02:00:38.420]  but they're working really hard on doing that.
[02:00:38.420 --> 02:00:40.220]  That if there was perhaps a way
[02:00:40.220 --> 02:00:43.180]  that they could get more stuff in there
[02:00:43.180 --> 02:00:46.100]  in a way that just automatically highlights folks
[02:00:46.100 --> 02:00:48.060]  like Matthew Casanelli and Chris Lawley,
[02:00:48.060 --> 02:00:50.060]  who are out there making some really cool
[02:00:50.060 --> 02:00:51.220]  and amazing things.
[02:00:51.220 --> 02:00:53.900]  And then it could just be, and hey, this person,
[02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:55.780]  by the way, already wrote the description
[02:00:55.780 --> 02:00:58.140]  for their shortcut as to what it does and how it works.
[02:00:58.140 --> 02:00:59.700]  And the download button's right there.
[02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:02.200]  And you happen to have a headshot of them
[02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:05.100]  and a tiny like three line bio that somebody wrote
[02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:07.320]  and they're just reusing until somebody says,
[02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:09.140]  hey, we should probably update this again.
[02:01:09.140 --> 02:01:11.100]  You know, bam, you've got some free content
[02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:13.160]  that's just there, so why not?
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:14.900]  I mean, unfortunately, some of the examples
[02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:16.420]  I'm thinking of that I'd love to submit
[02:01:16.420 --> 02:01:18.420]  just wouldn't work on the Mac, which is a real shame.
[02:01:18.420 --> 02:01:20.380]  I really hope the health app actually gets some love
[02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:22.900]  in that it gets onto your iPad and your Mac,
[02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:25.660]  because I imagine being able to view your ECG stuff
[02:01:25.660 --> 02:01:27.980]  on your Mac with those lovely big screens.
[02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:31.660]  I know that I can't log my heart data on my Mac.
[02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:33.800]  It doesn't have a heart reader built into it,
[02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:36.340]  but it would be great if I could read that information
[02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:38.020]  and write that information out with shortcuts.
[02:01:38.020 --> 02:01:40.660]  Yeah, it's funny because the Mac is the Mac
[02:01:40.660 --> 02:01:42.940]  because the Mac is the most capable platform,
[02:01:42.940 --> 02:01:44.880]  but it's funny that the Mac has also
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:46.900]  not had a weather app built in.
[02:01:46.900 --> 02:01:49.200]  Yeah, yeah, and what are stocks again?
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:50.580]  Wait, those are coming?
[02:01:50.580 --> 02:01:51.400]  I kind of get it.
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:52.940]  I know we're running towards the end,
[02:01:52.940 --> 02:01:53.960]  but one of the cool things,
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:55.380]  if people don't know that you can do,
[02:01:55.380 --> 02:01:58.080]  you mentioned it before, but that you can do,
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:01.720]  they call them in shortcuts parlance automations,
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:04.340]  but like an automation could be triggered.
[02:02:04.340 --> 02:02:06.020]  There's all sorts of neat ways,
[02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:07.540]  all sorts of things you could think of,
[02:02:07.540 --> 02:02:09.900]  but like one of them would be to do something
[02:02:09.900 --> 02:02:12.700]  at three o'clock every weekday, a timer.
[02:02:12.700 --> 02:02:15.420]  There've been ways to do that with computers forever,
[02:02:15.420 --> 02:02:19.820]  going back to cron on Unix, going back to like the 70s,
[02:02:19.820 --> 02:02:22.860]  but they've often been complicated,
[02:02:22.860 --> 02:02:24.580]  and you think, well, that shouldn't be hard.
[02:02:24.580 --> 02:02:26.260]  You just tell your computer to do this thing
[02:02:26.260 --> 02:02:27.180]  at a certain type of day,
[02:02:27.180 --> 02:02:29.060]  but you get into the nitty-gritty details
[02:02:29.060 --> 02:02:30.220]  of how computers work.
[02:02:30.220 --> 02:02:31.460]  What is time anyway?
[02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:33.420]  Are you using like cocoa time?
[02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:34.740]  Are you using epoch time?
[02:02:34.740 --> 02:02:38.260]  Well, and what is the computer running?
[02:02:38.260 --> 02:02:42.620]  And even when the sleep became a real thing,
[02:02:42.620 --> 02:02:44.660]  practically useful thing for computers
[02:02:44.660 --> 02:02:47.020]  to put them to sleep instead of powering them down,
[02:02:47.020 --> 02:02:50.200]  how much is it actually doing while it's sleeping
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:54.860]  other than the one thing it has to do is listen to wake up,
[02:02:54.860 --> 02:02:56.780]  but can it actually keep time?
[02:02:56.780 --> 02:02:58.920]  Does it check the clock every minute, whatever?
[02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:01.900]  But anyway, you can do that with shortcuts,
[02:03:01.900 --> 02:03:03.140]  and there's other ones too,
[02:03:03.140 --> 02:03:05.540]  that obvious things that you think of with your phone,
[02:03:05.540 --> 02:03:09.420]  like when you leave your home or when you come home
[02:03:09.420 --> 02:03:12.700]  or when you get to work or when you get somewhere.
[02:03:12.700 --> 02:03:14.500]  So you can do location-based ones.
[02:03:14.500 --> 02:03:16.800]  Any other, what are some of your other favorite triggers
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:18.140]  for an automation?
[02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:19.500]  Obviously, focus modes.
[02:03:19.500 --> 02:03:22.180]  Alarms going off, however, is one of my favorites.
[02:03:22.180 --> 02:03:24.940]  There's a really great app called Signals for HomeKit.
[02:03:24.940 --> 02:03:26.540]  So when my alarm goes off in the morning,
[02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:27.780]  if I hit the snooze button,
[02:03:27.780 --> 02:03:29.580]  Signals for HomeKit flashes the lights
[02:03:29.580 --> 02:03:30.480]  on the side of my bed.
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:31.820]  I call it the evil alarm clock.
[02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:33.480]  It's my punishment for hitting snooze,
[02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:35.060]  like flash the lights as bright,
[02:03:35.060 --> 02:03:37.180]  like that blue-white as possible,
[02:03:37.180 --> 02:03:39.660]  and then send them back to a slightly warmer white.
[02:03:39.660 --> 02:03:42.940]  But that definitely helps wake me up.
[02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:44.740]  Of course, CarPlay is a great one,
[02:03:44.740 --> 02:03:47.360]  and I really wish that some of the actions,
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:50.380]  like locations, could be automated,
[02:03:50.380 --> 02:03:52.940]  because you can work around that with a focus mode.
[02:03:52.940 --> 02:03:55.200]  So you can have a focus mode automatically activate
[02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:57.140]  at a specific location,
[02:03:57.140 --> 02:03:59.340]  and then you can use the focus mode activating
[02:03:59.340 --> 02:04:00.620]  to run a shortcut,
[02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:02.840]  but you can't just use arriving at a location
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:05.180]  as a completely automated solution.
[02:04:05.180 --> 02:04:08.300]  And NFC tags, I love NFC tags,
[02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:09.740]  having that built in.
[02:04:09.740 --> 02:04:13.780]  Like, I've stuck NFC tags on stuff like painkiller packaging
[02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:15.540]  so that I can then, when I take,
[02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:18.020]  if I've got a headache or something, I take Tylenol,
[02:04:18.020 --> 02:04:19.920]  I can tap my phone on it,
[02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:22.760]  and it will log that I have taken that at that time,
[02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:25.140]  so that then, you know, when I go to check it later,
[02:04:25.140 --> 02:04:26.940]  where I'm feeling slightly more with it,
[02:04:26.940 --> 02:04:29.420]  I can look back and go, oh, okay, I took this at that time,
[02:04:29.420 --> 02:04:31.660]  which is really useful, especially if you're ill.
[02:04:31.660 --> 02:04:33.500]  That's a really neat trick.
[02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:36.900]  So I'll tell you, a shortcut I made a while ago
[02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:39.140]  is I have a post office box,
[02:04:39.140 --> 02:04:43.340]  and I put it off for years and years and years getting one,
[02:04:43.340 --> 02:04:44.380]  and it was a great change,
[02:04:44.380 --> 02:04:45.220]  because now, all of a sudden,
[02:04:45.220 --> 02:04:48.460]  I can send an actual mailing address to anybody with that.
[02:04:48.460 --> 02:04:50.140]  I'm not giving out my home address,
[02:04:50.140 --> 02:04:51.820]  and it is, it's a great thing to do.
[02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:54.140]  I recommend it, especially if it's something you can do
[02:04:54.140 --> 02:04:56.220]  that's in your neighborhood or on your way somewhere.
[02:04:56.220 --> 02:04:58.140]  But then once you have a post office box,
[02:04:58.140 --> 02:04:58.980]  do you know what you have to do?
[02:04:58.980 --> 02:05:00.100]  You have to check it.
[02:05:00.100 --> 02:05:01.020]  Yeah.
[02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:05.220]  And so I wrote a shortcut a while back now,
[02:05:05.220 --> 02:05:07.680]  and every time I check my post office box,
[02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:09.620]  I run the shortcut on my phone.
[02:05:09.620 --> 02:05:11.460]  And in my mind, to make sure I do it,
[02:05:11.460 --> 02:05:15.380]  is I will not put my key in the post office box
[02:05:15.380 --> 02:05:17.140]  until I've run the shortcut.
[02:05:17.140 --> 02:05:18.280]  And then the shortcut just says,
[02:05:18.280 --> 02:05:20.900]  check the post office box, and then I open it.
[02:05:20.900 --> 02:05:23.220]  And then I have another one I can run that just says,
[02:05:23.220 --> 02:05:26.740]  how long has it been since I checked the post office box?
[02:05:26.740 --> 02:05:28.600]  And surprise, it often surprises me.
[02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:29.860]  I think I just checked the other day,
[02:05:29.860 --> 02:05:31.820]  and it'll say, like, 16 days.
[02:05:31.820 --> 02:05:33.940]  And I'll be like, ah!
[02:05:33.940 --> 02:05:34.760]  Whoops.
[02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:36.480]  Now, what I'm thinking, you're making me think,
[02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:39.080]  if I put an NFC tag in there,
[02:05:39.080 --> 02:05:41.460]  then I just have to bump my phone against it.
[02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:44.220]  And there's a couple of taps and a swipe I could get rid of.
[02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:47.420]  I'm just wondering if the post office will be spooked
[02:05:47.420 --> 02:05:48.340]  when they go in the back,
[02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:50.320]  you know, they go through the back of the post office box
[02:05:50.320 --> 02:05:52.520]  to put my packages and mail in there.
[02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:55.040]  If they look and see an NFC tag, are they gonna think,
[02:05:55.040 --> 02:05:55.880]  what the hell is that?
[02:05:55.880 --> 02:05:58.460]  I mean, like, it just looks like a sticker, right?
[02:05:58.460 --> 02:05:59.660]  Because a lot of them are just, like,
[02:05:59.660 --> 02:06:01.860]  these white round flat stickers that you can put in there.
[02:06:01.860 --> 02:06:03.740]  The only thing that you've gotta watch out for,
[02:06:03.740 --> 02:06:04.580]  which I'm gonna mention,
[02:06:04.580 --> 02:06:05.520]  because some folks will be going,
[02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:07.000]  oh, that's a great idea,
[02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.660]  is NFC tags don't do particularly well on metal.
[02:06:09.660 --> 02:06:11.020]  You'll need to get a shielded one.
[02:06:11.020 --> 02:06:13.100]  But they're really easy to get on Amazon.
[02:06:13.100 --> 02:06:14.060]  They're really easy to get.
[02:06:14.060 --> 02:06:15.420]  It's just make sure that you get one
[02:06:15.420 --> 02:06:16.780]  that you can put on metal,
[02:06:16.780 --> 02:06:19.260]  because otherwise you're gonna be like, wait, why is,
[02:06:19.260 --> 02:06:21.980]  like, it worked perfectly on the packaging at home,
[02:06:21.980 --> 02:06:23.260]  and it now doesn't work.
[02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:24.580]  Why doesn't it work?
[02:06:24.580 --> 02:06:25.780]  Oh, no.
[02:06:25.780 --> 02:06:27.660]  The answer is you need a shielded one.
[02:06:27.660 --> 02:06:29.580]  So that's just the first thing that came into my mind,
[02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:31.180]  but man, what a great idea that is.
[02:06:31.180 --> 02:06:32.100]  Yeah, it really is.
[02:06:32.100 --> 02:06:34.500]  I mean, then what you can do, okay,
[02:06:34.500 --> 02:06:36.180]  because you're doing that, like,
[02:06:36.180 --> 02:06:37.720]  and you have that date already, right?
[02:06:37.720 --> 02:06:41.820]  So take that, use Pushcut or use Widget Pack,
[02:06:41.820 --> 02:06:45.180]  one of those, one of the great shortcuts integration apps,
[02:06:45.180 --> 02:06:48.060]  and have a home screen widget that updates
[02:06:48.060 --> 02:06:50.340]  based on the date of the information.
[02:06:50.340 --> 02:06:52.160]  So I have a bunch of Widget Pack widgets
[02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:53.380]  and some Pushcut widgets as well,
[02:06:53.380 --> 02:06:55.260]  which update on a regular basis,
[02:06:55.260 --> 02:06:57.220]  pulling data in from other places.
[02:06:57.220 --> 02:06:59.060]  And some of my Widget Pack ones are basically like,
[02:06:59.060 --> 02:07:01.380]  hey, X number of days until this thing,
[02:07:01.380 --> 02:07:03.880]  or since you did that thing, whatever it is.
[02:07:03.880 --> 02:07:05.700]  And it just gives me a really, like,
[02:07:05.700 --> 02:07:08.620]  nice little view in a stack of other things
[02:07:08.620 --> 02:07:10.620]  that just cycles in and out throughout the day.
[02:07:10.620 --> 02:07:13.100]  So I've got Carrot Weather telling me, you know,
[02:07:13.100 --> 02:07:14.580]  whatever, you know.
[02:07:14.580 --> 02:07:16.140]  Actually, it's not so exciting now
[02:07:16.140 --> 02:07:18.980]  that there's a certain president missing,
[02:07:18.980 --> 02:07:21.960]  but you know, it's probably for the best, let's be honest.
[02:07:21.960 --> 02:07:24.040]  But you know, it's usually insulting me in some way
[02:07:24.040 --> 02:07:26.220]  and threatening my life, which I greatly appreciate.
[02:07:26.220 --> 02:07:27.500]  Thank you, Maker of Carrot.
[02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:29.700]  But you know, having all of that information
[02:07:29.700 --> 02:07:32.300]  just kind of like in your phone's home screen,
[02:07:32.300 --> 02:07:34.260]  cycling up and in and out.
[02:07:34.260 --> 02:07:36.080]  And of course, then depending on my focus modes,
[02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:36.940]  I change home screens,
[02:07:36.940 --> 02:07:39.100]  so I may or may not see that information.
[02:07:39.100 --> 02:07:40.840]  And if you have a focus mode trigger
[02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:42.180]  when you leave the house,
[02:07:42.180 --> 02:07:44.860]  then you know, that information then pops up
[02:07:44.860 --> 02:07:46.860]  and you're like, oh, hey, it's been two weeks
[02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:48.240]  since I checked my post office box.
[02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:50.580]  I'm just gonna go check that one now.
[02:07:50.580 --> 02:07:54.420]  Long story short, Apple really has enthusiastically
[02:07:54.420 --> 02:07:57.100]  allowed us to turn our iOS devices
[02:07:57.100 --> 02:08:01.860]  into customizable, automatable devices.
[02:08:01.860 --> 02:08:04.300]  Focus modes, you're opening up my ideas
[02:08:04.300 --> 02:08:05.900]  for ways that I can do this.
[02:08:05.900 --> 02:08:08.580]  You've given me too many ideas.
[02:08:08.580 --> 02:08:10.700]  I've got work to do, Rosemary.
[02:08:10.700 --> 02:08:12.180]  I'm sorry.
[02:08:12.180 --> 02:08:13.620]  But yeah, that's fantastic.
[02:08:13.620 --> 02:08:15.180]  I will admit I wasn't gonna mention it
[02:08:15.180 --> 02:08:16.560]  because I didn't wanna further digress,
[02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:18.380]  but I actually do have a widget
[02:08:18.380 --> 02:08:19.780]  that shows me how long it's been
[02:08:19.780 --> 02:08:23.300]  since I checked the PO box that I made in Scriptable.
[02:08:23.300 --> 02:08:25.300]  Yep, another great solution for this.
[02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:28.780]  Right, but maybe Pushkit or Widget Pack,
[02:08:28.780 --> 02:08:29.860]  neither of which I've tried,
[02:08:29.860 --> 02:08:31.820]  but now they're on my list, I swear.
[02:08:31.820 --> 02:08:35.700]  You've also broken my sheet of paper here
[02:08:35.700 --> 02:08:37.860]  where I'm jotting down things for the show notes
[02:08:37.860 --> 02:08:39.120]  with too many links.
[02:08:39.120 --> 02:08:39.960]  I'm gonna miss some.
[02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:40.780]  I can no longer promise that we're gonna make them.
[02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:41.620]  That's all right.
[02:08:41.620 --> 02:08:43.060]  I put some of them in an Apple note for us
[02:08:43.060 --> 02:08:45.100]  so I can send you that later.
[02:08:45.100 --> 02:08:47.740]  This has been an absolute blast.
[02:08:47.740 --> 02:08:48.580]  Thank you. Thank you.
[02:08:48.580 --> 02:08:49.400]  Thank you for your time
[02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:50.580]  and thank you for everything else you do.
[02:08:50.580 --> 02:08:52.180]  I'm gonna give some shout outs.
[02:08:52.180 --> 02:08:55.980]  So number one, perhaps most applicable
[02:08:55.980 --> 02:08:57.540]  to today's discussion,
[02:08:57.540 --> 02:09:01.060]  you do a regular podcast called Automators
[02:09:01.060 --> 02:09:05.540]  over on Relay FM with a friend of the show, David Sparks,
[02:09:05.540 --> 02:09:08.380]  which is one of my favorite shows.
[02:09:08.380 --> 02:09:10.660]  You've also got Nested Folders,
[02:09:10.660 --> 02:09:15.500]  which is another podcast that you do with Scotty,
[02:09:15.500 --> 02:09:16.340]  no, something Scotty.
[02:09:16.340 --> 02:09:17.380]  Yeah, Scotty Jackson.
[02:09:17.380 --> 02:09:18.680]  Scotty Jackson, all right.
[02:09:18.680 --> 02:09:23.680]  You are a host of iOS Today on This Week in Tech.
[02:09:23.860 --> 02:09:24.700]  Yep.
[02:09:24.700 --> 02:09:28.380]  Which to me is oddly named because it's once a week.
[02:09:28.380 --> 02:09:32.060]  And so it's like, it's iOS Today, but only on Tuesdays.
[02:09:32.060 --> 02:09:32.980]  Yes, it is.
[02:09:32.980 --> 02:09:34.340]  But it works out really well
[02:09:34.340 --> 02:09:35.980]  because we get enough time every week
[02:09:35.980 --> 02:09:37.780]  for some folks who do watch live
[02:09:37.780 --> 02:09:40.100]  to actually think about it and send us their feedback.
[02:09:40.100 --> 02:09:41.980]  And then everyone else is like, oh my gosh,
[02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:42.820]  it's usually Monday.
[02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:44.000]  Everyone watches it over the weekend
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:45.340]  and then Monday there's just bam,
[02:09:45.340 --> 02:09:48.020]  avalanche of feedback for the show on Tuesday.
[02:09:48.020 --> 02:09:49.380]  So it's working out well.
[02:09:49.380 --> 02:09:51.460]  But anyway, and last but not least, of course,
[02:09:51.460 --> 02:09:54.060]  your homepage, which is a terrific blog
[02:09:54.060 --> 02:09:57.940]  that I've been a long time reader of, rosemaryorchard.com.
[02:09:57.940 --> 02:10:00.800]  And of course, you've got links to all of these shows
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:02.760]  at rosemaryorchard.com.
[02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:05.380]  So if you want to find out more and listen to these shows,
[02:10:05.380 --> 02:10:08.760]  and if you, I mean, we only touch the surface.
[02:10:08.760 --> 02:10:11.540]  Literally, if you think, how can there be an entire podcast
[02:10:11.540 --> 02:10:14.780]  about automation stuff on Apple platforms?
[02:10:14.780 --> 02:10:18.060]  Seriously, they're never gonna run out of topics.
[02:10:18.060 --> 02:10:20.260]  No, we're over a hundred episodes now.
[02:10:20.260 --> 02:10:21.980]  There is no stopping us, basically.
[02:10:21.980 --> 02:10:23.820]  Freddie Mercury said of us, don't stop me now.
[02:10:23.820 --> 02:10:25.860]  We're about to release episode 109
[02:10:25.860 --> 02:10:27.180]  as we record this episode.
[02:10:27.180 --> 02:10:29.900]  So yeah, we've been going for long enough
[02:10:29.900 --> 02:10:31.660]  that we're not stopping.
[02:10:31.660 --> 02:10:32.620]  Well, congrats.
[02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:33.540]  Anyway, thanks for that.
[02:10:33.540 --> 02:10:35.940]  Let me also thank our sponsors for the day
[02:10:35.940 --> 02:10:39.140]  we had Indochino made for you.
[02:10:39.140 --> 02:10:41.660]  Remember the promo code, the talk show,

[02:11:01.780 --> 02:11:14.460]  Thank you, Rosemary.
