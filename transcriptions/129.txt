[00:00.000 --> 00:03.760]  90 minutes or bust. I think we have the title already.
[00:07.200 --> 00:09.840]  I remember when people used to complain when the show was over an hour.
[00:10.800 --> 00:16.480]  Yeah, and then you just gave up on it. I got bitter, actually, because someone recommended
[00:16.480 --> 00:21.360]  my podcast on Twitter, which I appreciated, and which I will add because people are going to
[00:21.360 --> 00:26.080]  bitch that I'm recording with you and I haven't recorded Exponent all summer. We're going to
[00:26.080 --> 00:32.720]  record the next episode later later today. So I'm back. I'm podcasting. But someone's like,
[00:32.720 --> 00:35.760]  Oh, yeah, but the problem is, you know, all those podcasts is gone forever. They need some
[00:35.760 --> 00:40.640]  good editing. I'm like, I spend hours every week editing our podcast to keep it to an hour.
[00:40.640 --> 00:43.440]  Don't let me in with Gruber. I was very I was upset.
[00:43.440 --> 00:47.440]  Well, I know what they mean, though. I and I, you know, it would be a very different show,
[00:47.440 --> 00:53.280]  though. You know, it's it's Have you heard of this? The slack? I think it's called the
[00:53.280 --> 00:58.080]  slack variety pack. No, I don't think so. It's new.
[01:00.960 --> 01:04.880]  Yeah, slack variety pack. If you just Google slack variety pack, you'll find it.
[01:04.880 --> 01:13.760]  So it's a podcast that slack is sponsoring ish. It's not the people who are making it
[01:13.760 --> 01:18.640]  are not slack employees, but they don't even get names or credit. And this is all you know,
[01:18.640 --> 01:25.680]  this is as as by design. But it's so you know, it's sort of like the way that like,
[01:27.920 --> 01:33.520]  I think, like, wasn't like the Milton Berle show like the Texaco Star Hour or something like that
[01:33.520 --> 01:38.640]  the Texaco is something you know, so it's just a podcast with the name the slack variety pack,
[01:38.640 --> 01:45.840]  and there's very, very minimal slack promotion in it. But it's like each little 20 minute episode is
[01:45.840 --> 01:52.960]  like a series of three or four minute, very edited, like NPR style segments. It's sort of
[01:52.960 --> 01:58.640]  like an NPR for nerds. And it's really good. I did an interview with them for an episode that's
[01:58.640 --> 02:03.600]  coming up. Probably not maybe like a month seems like they're like a month ahead or something like
[02:03.600 --> 02:08.560]  that. But I listened to a few episodes before I agreed to do it. And I was blown away. It's like
[02:08.560 --> 02:14.080]  NPR, very edited, tightly, tightly edited, which is great. And I love it. And I've subscribed to
[02:14.080 --> 02:20.240]  the slack variety pack. And in theory, I could do a show that is similarly edited. I mean, and,
[02:20.240 --> 02:27.840]  you know, but I don't. Well, I think it's fine. I think it's fine, though, because like,
[02:28.400 --> 02:32.880]  this ends up being and you put it as like the director's commentary for during fireball,
[02:32.880 --> 02:39.360]  which, you know, is is very tightly written and edited. So it kind of makes sense that that it's
[02:39.360 --> 02:44.080]  it's the opposite. And yeah, I think both serve a role. I mean, I mean, the talk show is great when
[02:44.080 --> 02:49.760]  you're like cleaning house or something. And it's, or I mean, now you know where I categorize you
[02:49.760 --> 02:54.800]  right or driving, driving, walking on, you know, doing errands or something like that. No, it's
[02:54.800 --> 02:59.200]  exactly to me, though, that those two forms are very traditional in in radio where the
[02:59.200 --> 03:04.560]  MBR has been NPR and has done these tightly edited segments. I mean, for those of you outside the
[03:04.560 --> 03:12.640]  States, NPR is the U.S. is National Public Radio. And it's very I would say I think it's outstanding
[03:12.640 --> 03:19.040]  quality and very well regarded. And, you know, like they have shows like All Things Considered
[03:19.040 --> 03:25.600]  and what was the show that was? What's the Ira Glasses show? This American Life is American Life,
[03:25.600 --> 03:31.920]  yeah. That are famous for, you know, the quality of the writing and the broadcasting,
[03:31.920 --> 03:35.760]  but also like they're tightly edited. And on the other side, they're, you know, talk radio has been
[03:35.760 --> 03:40.560]  a thing as long as there's been radio. And that's more like what my podcast is like. And most of the
[03:40.560 --> 03:47.360]  podcasts and in our racket are like... It is it is funny that I think we have this mini discussion
[03:47.360 --> 03:52.400]  every time I'm on because I think you've messaged me 90 minutes or bust and I think I just replied
[03:52.400 --> 04:00.560]  with a straight lol. I'm surprised it wasn't an emoji. Yeah, I'm rusty. I'm a little off my game.
[04:00.560 --> 04:04.560]  Yeah. What would be the... I'm jet lagged too. I'm jet lagged too. I'll get out. It's 653 a.m.
[04:04.560 --> 04:08.400]  here and I've been awake for like six hours. What would be the emoji you would throw at me? The poop?
[04:11.360 --> 04:15.040]  Probably like the emoji with like the one eye open and the tongue sticking out.
[04:15.040 --> 04:19.600]  Right. I got you. You've had a busy summer. You've been you were traveling in the States
[04:19.600 --> 04:24.720]  and now you're back on the other side of what do we call the Atlantic? The pond. What do we call
[04:24.720 --> 04:32.080]  the Pacific? The Pacific is the big pond. I don't know. It's definitely a lot bigger than the
[04:32.080 --> 04:35.440]  Atlantic. I'll tell you that. I'm sure that's exactly what... Well, I know in fact I've done
[04:35.440 --> 04:40.400]  it. I know what it feels like when you're flying over it. I had a particularly rough one this time
[04:40.400 --> 04:45.920]  because... Yes, I mean it was just me and my two kids. My wife every summer comes back a couple
[04:45.920 --> 04:52.160]  weeks early. We've only done two summers. But that's like her annual vacation. She hits two
[04:52.160 --> 04:59.920]  weeks of filming around. But I realized that I haven't done the... Because my parents are in the
[04:59.920 --> 05:05.520]  Midwest so go from Chicago to Taipei. There's no direct flight so you have to connect. Prior to
[05:05.520 --> 05:11.280]  that we were in Seattle and then last year we did an overnight stay in Seoul, Korea on the way back.
[05:11.280 --> 05:17.120]  I hadn't done the one trip all the way in a while. So I forgot just how brutal it was. Then to make
[05:17.120 --> 05:21.200]  it worse, our flight going got moved forward an hour and a half and our flight going back got
[05:21.200 --> 05:26.960]  delayed. So it actually ended up being 26 hours door to door. Two hours at the airport in Chicago.
[05:26.960 --> 05:32.720]  So yeah, it was rough. The kids were awesome. I mean they're pretty experienced at this point.
[05:32.720 --> 05:40.000]  But man, it was hard. O'Hare? Had to be O'Hare. My parents are in this weird spot. They're just
[05:40.000 --> 05:46.320]  outside Madison but to the south of Madison where they're far enough from the Madison airport and
[05:46.320 --> 05:50.960]  close enough to O'Hare, it doesn't make sense to fly from Madison, but that means it's to drive
[05:50.960 --> 05:56.800]  two hours to O'Hare which just adds a whole layer of stink on top of the entire endeavor.
[05:56.800 --> 06:03.520]  I was thinking of Midway. Midway doesn't make any sense for international travel.
[06:03.520 --> 06:08.800]  Yeah, I think that I hate Southwest but I think most of it's because in Chicago it's only Midway
[06:08.800 --> 06:16.080]  which is on the south side of Chicago and it is just awful to get to. So I've sworn off that.
[06:16.080 --> 06:21.040]  It's good though. For me, I've liked it over the years because it's good if you just want to go to
[06:21.040 --> 06:27.280]  downtown Chicago. You fly into Midway and Southwest has little tons of flights every day between
[06:27.280 --> 06:35.200]  Philly and Midway. So you have tons of options and then you get off and you just walk right over to
[06:35.200 --> 06:42.240]  whatever the CTA and you get a card, put 20 bucks on it and it's like the end point for the, I think
[06:42.240 --> 06:45.840]  it's the orange line. You don't even have to pay attention. You just get on an orange train and
[06:45.840 --> 06:49.600]  next thing you know you're downtown. It's actually pretty good. But for anything else, you've got to
[06:49.600 --> 06:58.160]  go to O'Hare. But it's good though. I mean, air travel, it sounds so cliche but I used to swear
[06:58.160 --> 07:05.600]  off. I've been doing this for 13 years now and I swore off ever flying US airline over the Pacific
[07:05.600 --> 07:13.360]  but I've jumped full back in with United basically because all their cross-Pacific planes now have
[07:13.360 --> 07:18.960]  Wi-Fi and power at their seats which is unbelievable. I mean, yeah, I know the whole Wi-Fi
[07:18.960 --> 07:22.000]  thing has been done but because they actually have satellite Wi-Fi which works way better than
[07:22.000 --> 07:30.720]  that Go-Go crap and it's stunningly cheap. It's like $16 or $17 and man, it just transforms the
[07:30.720 --> 07:36.400]  whole flight. It's awesome. We're easily on pace for a 90-minute show since we haven't even touched
[07:36.400 --> 07:42.240]  it. Can I just tell you, I had the worst Go-Go experience ever a few weeks ago. I'm trying to
[07:42.240 --> 07:48.560]  remember if it was coming home from WWDC. That would be months ago but it was sometime this
[07:48.560 --> 07:55.120]  summer. It might have been coming home from WWDC and Amy was out with me and we're flying home on
[07:55.120 --> 08:01.920]  US airlines slash American. It's all one thing now but they've, I don't know, they're like in
[08:01.920 --> 08:07.200]  this weird one boat and one foot in one boat and one foot in the other state right now.
[08:07.200 --> 08:13.040]  We get on and I've, because of Philly, Philly is a huge US air hub and has been forever so I mean,
[08:13.040 --> 08:19.200]  that's where I'm platinum and that's where I fly all the time. I always just book my Go-Go when I
[08:19.200 --> 08:23.360]  get on the plane. That's what I've always done and some, I've heard that you're supposed to book a
[08:23.360 --> 08:27.360]  day in advance or whatever and it just never occurred to me. So we get on the plane and I'm
[08:27.360 --> 08:34.160]  looking at the Go-Go options and there are no options to get service for more than an hour
[08:34.160 --> 08:39.760]  and the hourly rate was, I don't know, onerous. It was really expensive other than signing up
[08:39.760 --> 08:46.080]  for a monthly subscription. And then you can't unsubscribe, right? Yeah, when you get a monthly
[08:46.080 --> 08:53.440]  subscription to Go-Go, there is no way to cancel it. You have to call them or email them.
[08:55.440 --> 09:01.360]  And it's 50 bucks. Oh, they're a terrible company. I mean, it seems crazy.
[09:01.360 --> 09:06.640]  They're a terrible company. I mean, it seems criminal, but I did have a flight later that
[09:06.640 --> 09:11.360]  month and I knew I was flying at the, it was, it had to be WWDC because I knew it was June and I
[09:11.360 --> 09:16.000]  knew I was flying again at the end of June and I thought, you know, it actually would work out
[09:16.720 --> 09:24.080]  almost, you know, like the 50 bucks isn't that bad. So I did it. I felt so bad, but I was watching,
[09:24.080 --> 09:29.840]  it was so fun. It felt bad, but I was watching this woman one row up across the aisle from me
[09:29.840 --> 09:34.240]  on her tablet. And I think it was actually, it was interesting for a few reasons. I think
[09:34.800 --> 09:40.560]  I think it was a Kindle tablet, not an iPad. And it's very unusual for me to see people
[09:40.560 --> 09:45.040]  using tablets on, you know, regular consumer type people using consumers on iPads.
[09:45.040 --> 09:49.280]  And all she was doing was over and over and over again, trying to get on the wifi and get the,
[09:49.280 --> 09:53.920]  you know, just let me pay for wifi for this flight. And she's looking at the options and
[09:53.920 --> 09:57.920]  she's like, and I could see, and she was like reading all the fine print and thinking, you
[09:57.920 --> 10:02.000]  know, I could see what she was thinking, you know, that there must be some little fine print thing,
[10:02.000 --> 10:06.720]  like click here to just get a pass for this flight. And she couldn't find it. She spent like
[10:06.720 --> 10:12.240]  25 minutes trying to sign up for wifi. Well, what's bad is, I mean, they obviously have a
[10:12.240 --> 10:15.760]  monopoly and a captive audience, all that sort of stuff and all, you know, no real incentive to
[10:15.760 --> 10:22.800]  provide decent service. But the, the thing that's kind of nasty is I use them. I used to use them a
[10:22.800 --> 10:27.520]  lot when I used to travel a lot with Microsoft. And so I had like a monthly account or whatever
[10:27.520 --> 10:34.480]  like that. And so I experienced the impossible to cancel thing. But they now, if you sign up,
[10:34.480 --> 10:39.520]  they opt you into storing your credit card with them and give you no option to opt out.
[10:39.520 --> 10:44.000]  Right. And so like, they will keep your credit card no matter what. And then, so I, I,
[10:44.000 --> 10:49.120]  I bought it and then I logged in and immediately removed my credit card. And needless to say,
[10:49.120 --> 10:52.960]  four days later, I get on a return flight and my credit card is still there. So not only do they
[10:52.960 --> 10:59.360]  opt you in without, without giving you an option, they actually failed or lied to actually remove
[10:59.360 --> 11:03.280]  when I told them to. Yeah. They're, they're, they're an awful company and the satellite
[11:03.280 --> 11:07.200]  based stuff is so much better. I think they're watching satellite service, but yeah, I hope they
[11:07.200 --> 11:12.080]  die. I mean, they're, they're, uh, it's really bad. Uh, the only thing that's good about the
[11:12.080 --> 11:17.600]  monthly plan is it seems like if you, if you do agree to this $50 a month thing, you can then
[11:17.600 --> 11:23.760]  like have your laptop on and, uh, get your, if you're put it away under a seat or something,
[11:23.760 --> 11:27.440]  and then you get out your iPhone, you can get on with your iPhone. And then when you go back to
[11:27.440 --> 11:32.880]  your iPad, it's still on as opposed to the, every time you log on with a second device,
[11:32.880 --> 11:37.680]  you're logged out of the previous device. Oh, interesting. That that's nice. Yeah,
[11:37.680 --> 11:41.360]  for sure. Uh, all right. Well, we're, we're, we're not gonna, we have to do this 90 minute
[11:41.360 --> 11:47.200]  things. We're gonna get it. We'll make it, uh, best, best. Not like anything happens in August.
[11:47.200 --> 11:52.320]  Best customer service flight experience I've ever had was a Southwest flight out of, um,
[11:52.320 --> 11:58.400]  uh, out of Midway. And it was at one of the C4 conferences. So it was probably like 2007 or 2008.
[11:59.040 --> 12:07.040]  And in Philadelphia, the subway lines are colored and like the blue line runs, uh, East West orange
[12:07.040 --> 12:12.800]  line runs North South. And there aren't, like there aren't multiple colors on the same track.
[12:12.800 --> 12:17.440]  And I knew from previous years that to get out to Midway, I knew which it was this, you know,
[12:17.440 --> 12:22.480]  cause it was the same hotel. You go to this station, go up the steps and, uh, take an
[12:22.480 --> 12:26.720]  orange train on the right and that'll be going the right direction. I was, I remembered it.
[12:26.720 --> 12:31.200]  And so it was me and another guy who was at the conference actually. And, um, actually,
[12:31.200 --> 12:35.040]  I guess I was the one who raced up. I raced up the stairs and there was a train already there.
[12:35.040 --> 12:39.760]  And I was like, this is my lucky day. And I jumped into the train and I look and I recognized a face
[12:39.760 --> 12:45.280]  from the C4 conference, like a, somebody else who attended, didn't know him. Uh, I think he knew who
[12:45.280 --> 12:50.000]  I was. Uh, so I sat down and we just started talking and, you know, we made quick friends
[12:50.000 --> 12:53.440]  and it was a great way to pass the time. And then all of a sudden I thought, you know, this is
[12:53.440 --> 13:00.880]  taking longer than it usually does. And we like, we look out the window and it does not look anything
[13:00.880 --> 13:05.280]  like what I remember the trip to Midway looking. And it ends up that in Chicago, they have multiple
[13:05.280 --> 13:12.320]  colored trains that take the same, the same life, right? Actually, maybe it was my fault. It might've
[13:12.320 --> 13:16.960]  been that we were going up the steps together and I told him, quick, get on. Now that I think about
[13:16.960 --> 13:21.680]  it, uh, if you're out there, if you're down in the loop, yeah, they're, they're all on the same track.
[13:21.680 --> 13:25.600]  I don't remember, uh, this fellow's name, but if you're out there listening to the show and you
[13:25.600 --> 13:32.400]  remember this, I'm very sorry. Uh, well, it ends up we were way out in North Chicago and it was not
[13:32.400 --> 13:39.120]  it was not a good neighborhood. Uh, and we asked, uh, got off, we're recognizing our mistake, got
[13:39.120 --> 13:42.880]  off and I asked at CTA employee, Hey, what's, is there any, you know, what's the best way we can
[13:42.880 --> 13:47.840]  get a cab? And they were like, get back on the train and go all the way back downtown. And I'm
[13:47.840 --> 13:52.160]  like, are you joking? And they're like, you, there are no cabs out here. This is, there's no cabs.
[13:53.040 --> 13:57.120]  Um, so that's really, and I was like, are you serious that that's like the best way? And they're
[13:57.120 --> 14:00.320]  like, yeah, the best way for you to get the Midway would be to get back on the same train. You were
[14:00.320 --> 14:05.280]  just ongoing the other way, go all the way back down to where you were and wait for the train
[14:05.280 --> 14:09.920]  that you should have gotten on. Um, so I'm doing this, I picked, take out my cell phone and call
[14:09.920 --> 14:16.640]  Southwest. And I'm thinking I am screwed. Uh, I, you know, and you know, during fireball was
[14:16.640 --> 14:21.440]  just barely off the ground, like, you know, rebooking for hundreds of dollars more was
[14:21.440 --> 14:26.880]  going to be seriously like an expense that was not prepared for. I call Southwest and tell him and,
[14:26.880 --> 14:33.120]  and the woman says, um, I got, I have another flight leaving, uh, 70 minutes after the one
[14:33.120 --> 14:35.840]  you were on. How about that one? And I was like, yeah, how much is it going to cost? She was
[14:35.840 --> 14:40.800]  nothing. I was like, really? And she was like, yeah, it's the same price. So don't worry about
[14:40.800 --> 14:45.680]  it. That will make you, that will make you a happy customer for a very long time. I was like,
[14:45.680 --> 14:50.800]  that's, I'm going to be about an hour late. So that is absolutely perfect. And she was like,
[14:50.800 --> 14:56.880]  okay, thanks for flying Southwest. And it took like three minutes and I went from having an
[14:56.880 --> 15:01.680]  absolutely horrible day to having, I actually felt better than if I had just made my flight.
[15:01.680 --> 15:06.960]  Dude, that's the thing. That is the thing about customer service that, that there's two things
[15:06.960 --> 15:11.200]  I think about customer service and also about like just buying stuff. Um, that makes such a
[15:11.200 --> 15:17.200]  difference. I mean, a good service experience can actually make something better than it was
[15:17.200 --> 15:20.400]  originally. Like, even if you're dealing with a broken product or something like that. Um,
[15:20.400 --> 15:24.880]  I had to do the, uh, you know, I had to do the, the, I, I also got my Apple watch replaced. I
[15:24.880 --> 15:29.600]  think we, we talked about this, um, on Twitter or whatever, uh, the Taptic Engine was failing,
[15:29.600 --> 15:34.000]  but yeah, I mean, it's still, it's still not the, uh, you walk in and they give you a new one on
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.320]  the spot. Cause they, now they have to mail them in with the watches, but still it took two days
[15:38.320 --> 15:44.240]  and they called me up and they gave me a brand new watch. And like the fact I didn't have to like
[15:44.240 --> 15:49.200]  hassle them about it or like, you know, it's, it's just, it makes a big difference for sure.
[15:49.200 --> 15:53.600]  Yeah. But, but that it's interesting though, you mentioned the, the, uh, I'm going to,
[15:53.600 --> 15:58.560]  I'm going to hijack the conversation. Um, cause obviously a big thing about if you were up in the
[15:58.560 --> 16:03.040]  middle of nowhere was now you could call an Uber much more easily and they're, they're much better
[16:03.040 --> 16:08.160]  at serving, you know, serving underserved areas than, than cabs have ever been. Um,
[16:08.160 --> 16:12.720]  I do. I wonder about that. Yeah, well, well, the Uber thing is interesting in general,
[16:12.720 --> 16:18.320]  but I do hope at some point we get to the, um, the Uber, this is a long extended segue to like
[16:18.320 --> 16:24.400]  cars and ride sharing and all this. And I am, I would love to get your thoughts about the,
[16:25.040 --> 16:32.080]  the seemingly all but confirmed Apple car because I am still a little baffled about the whole thing,
[16:32.080 --> 16:38.080]  but we don't get to do now, but I, I, I would love to. Yeah. Well, uh, why don't I take a moment
[16:38.080 --> 16:43.200]  here as we, as we rocket towards our 90 minute, uh, episode length, I'll take a moment here and
[16:43.200 --> 16:46.880]  thank our first sponsor and then we can do that. We can just talk about the Apple car stuff that's
[16:46.880 --> 16:51.920]  popped up in the last month or so. Cause I don't think I've talked about it and I know you haven't
[16:51.920 --> 16:56.960]  because, um, you've been off the air, but let me take a moment and thank our first sponsor. It's
[16:56.960 --> 17:04.400]  our good friends at Harry's, uh, go to harrys.com and use the promo code, the talk show, and you'll
[17:04.400 --> 17:11.120]  save five bucks off your first purchase. What do they sell? Harry's offers high quality razors and
[17:11.120 --> 17:17.520]  blades for a fraction of the price of the big name razor brands. Harry's was started by two guys who
[17:17.520 --> 17:22.960]  wanted a better product without paying an arm and a leg. Um, the story I remember hearing was that
[17:22.960 --> 17:27.520]  one of the founders was, you know, like traveling or something, forgot his razor, went into,
[17:27.520 --> 17:31.680]  you know, the drug store, big name drug store right next to the hotel he was staying at
[17:32.320 --> 17:36.960]  and couldn't even get it because the blades and everything were locked behind those plexiglass
[17:36.960 --> 17:42.560]  cabinets with a padlock and you have to find an employee of the store and get them to come over
[17:42.560 --> 17:46.880]  and unlock the padlock and then you get to actually buy the stuff and it's like, why can't I just
[17:46.880 --> 17:52.320]  buy this stuff? Um, and that's where he got the idea that, you know, this is perfect thing to
[17:52.320 --> 17:58.640]  sell online. Um, really, really serious company though. They make their own razor blades. They
[17:58.640 --> 18:02.800]  bought an old blade factory in Germany. They were buying the blades from them and they liked the
[18:02.800 --> 18:08.480]  blades. They are getting so much. They just bought the factory. That must be nice if you can do that.
[18:09.440 --> 18:13.840]  These are high quality, high performing German blades crafted by shaving experts,
[18:13.840 --> 18:19.920]  giving you a better shave that respects your face and wallet. They offer factory direct pricing.
[18:19.920 --> 18:25.280]  That's how they, that's how they sell these, the, these quality blades so much cheaper because they
[18:25.280 --> 18:29.680]  make them in their factory and then they package them up and then they just ship them right to you
[18:29.680 --> 18:34.240]  and there's no middleman, no distributors, no retailers, nothing like that. That's how they
[18:34.240 --> 18:39.600]  cut the price in half and it really is about a half the price. Their starter set is an amazing
[18:39.600 --> 18:46.240]  deal. 15 bucks gets you a razor moisturizing shave cream or gel your preference and three
[18:46.800 --> 18:53.120]  razor blades. I got my, uh, starter kit years ago. Whenever you've been listening to show for a long
[18:53.120 --> 18:56.880]  time, you know how long Harris has been a sponsor. They sent me one of these years ago when I first
[18:56.880 --> 19:03.200]  got started and I, I've looked at it recently. It looks brand new. It looks absolutely like mint
[19:03.200 --> 19:07.840]  condition. It really does hold up and I just, you know, keep it on a shelf in the shower. I mean,
[19:07.840 --> 19:11.920]  it's not even, uh, it's not like a baby or anything like that. Really high quality stuff.
[19:12.560 --> 19:19.680]  Um, replacement blades are two bucks each or less. You can get a pack for 15 bucks, 16 pack for just
[19:19.680 --> 19:28.080]  $25. Uh, really, really great stuff and really nice packaging. Great heavy field to the blade.
[19:28.080 --> 19:33.520]  Everything is just really nice. My dad out of the blue, unprompted by me, I guess he, he like
[19:33.520 --> 19:38.880]  loads my website, I don't know, once a week or something like that. Just to see what I'm up to.
[19:38.880 --> 19:46.240]  Uh, uh, not the sort of person who buys stuff like this online. Uh, he told me he's, he, he, uh,
[19:46.240 --> 19:49.760]  he saw that they were a sponsor of my thing. I swear to God, I didn't tell him go buy this.
[19:49.760 --> 19:54.640]  He went and did it on his own. He was like, man, this is really nice. Uh, so there's a testimony.
[19:54.640 --> 20:02.560]  Uh, my dad, Bob Gruber tells you that Harry's, uh, razorblades and shaving cream are really nice.
[20:02.560 --> 20:09.440]  Also, my dad is a notorious, uh, cheapskate. Does not listen to the show. I hope he doesn't. Um,
[20:09.440 --> 20:14.560]  but he does. He's, he's pretty tight fisted. Uh, thought it was a great deal. In fact,
[20:14.560 --> 20:18.880]  I don't think he would have done it if not. So, uh, there you go. There's a testimony
[20:18.880 --> 20:24.800]  from my dad. Go check them out. Uh, like I said, go to harrys.com and use the promo code
[20:24.800 --> 20:29.600]  talk show. No, no, the, I don't know what I said at the beginning of the read, but
[20:29.600 --> 20:35.120]  at the end here, uh, just remember talk show, no, the, and you will save five bucks off your
[20:35.120 --> 20:39.360]  first purchase. So that $15 starter kit is just 10 bucks. My thanks to Harry's.
[20:39.360 --> 20:44.240]  So, so how did you end up, uh, with a Mac way back in the day, if your,
[20:44.240 --> 20:50.240]  if your father was a notorious cheapskate? Oh, that's a great, that's a great, uh, question.
[20:50.240 --> 20:55.920]  Well, uh, first part is, and I've told this before, uh, when I was growing up, I did not own
[20:55.920 --> 21:02.480]  a computer. Um, and, uh, because my, my parents would not buy me one and a lot of my friends are
[21:02.480 --> 21:06.160]  having trouble getting their parents to buy them a computer. They were, you know, relatively
[21:06.160 --> 21:10.480]  expensive in the eighties. And the line most of my friends got was, I'm not going to spend all
[21:10.480 --> 21:14.320]  that money. You're not going to use it. And my parents explanation to me was, we're not going
[21:14.320 --> 21:19.360]  to buy you a computer because if we do, you're never going to leave the house. This is true.
[21:20.080 --> 21:24.880]  And I resented it deeply because I wanted nothing in the world more than a computer. But I have to
[21:24.880 --> 21:31.280]  say that there was, you know, there's some merit to their argument and they in some ways knew me
[21:31.280 --> 21:37.280]  better than perhaps, you know, I know myself and I, uh, uh, you know, I don't know. I certainly
[21:37.280 --> 21:41.280]  read a lot more books and novels as a teenager than I would've if I owned a computer.
[21:42.160 --> 21:47.760]  That's interesting because like, I, I, I tend to, to kind of like, um, resent my parents for
[21:47.760 --> 21:53.600]  a similar reason. Like they, I didn't really, you know, have access to a computer or was never
[21:53.600 --> 21:57.440]  really pushed in that direction, even though like, you know, kind of wonder like, well,
[21:57.440 --> 22:02.080]  if I had been into that before I went to school, like what, you know, what track would I be on now?
[22:02.080 --> 22:07.200]  Would I be, you know, a, a, a programmer or would I have started my own company or whatever, blah,
[22:07.200 --> 22:13.120]  blah, blah. And, um, obviously in, in the end, it ended up working out pretty well to end up having
[22:13.120 --> 22:18.080]  much more of a kind of literary background, a lot of reading, um, water writing. I did the student
[22:18.080 --> 22:22.800]  paper thing as well. Uh, but it's interesting. You kind of put it like, say that word resentment
[22:22.800 --> 22:26.720]  because something I thought about as well. It's like, but it actually, yeah, probably
[22:26.720 --> 22:30.800]  turned out for the best. Um, and then in high school, now I did have a good, pretty good
[22:30.800 --> 22:37.360]  computer science, um, teacher in high school and we had a little lab, um, mostly Apple,
[22:38.160 --> 22:42.320]  I guess by the time I got to high school, they were mostly Apple, two GS's. And I think there
[22:42.320 --> 22:49.680]  was one Macintosh. Um, and I D I appreciated the Macintosh greatly. I really did. And I enjoyed my
[22:49.680 --> 22:54.880]  time on it. Um, but I chose to spend most of my time on the two GS cause that's where I was most
[22:54.880 --> 22:59.280]  familiar and that, and for writing, you know, the programming assignments I had, I was most familiar
[22:59.280 --> 23:06.160]  with the, the tools. Um, but then when I went to college in 1991 at Drexel, you had to have access
[23:06.160 --> 23:10.640]  to a Macintosh. Now that didn't mean you had to buy one cause you, there was a lab, but I mean,
[23:10.640 --> 23:15.120]  effectively though, it was highly recommended that all incoming freshmen buy one and the student
[23:15.120 --> 23:19.920]  discounts at the time were tremendous. I think it was like close to 50% off. It might've been like
[23:19.920 --> 23:27.280]  40% off. Nice. So I got, I got a Macintosh when I was a freshman in college and it was a big reason.
[23:27.280 --> 23:30.880]  One of the reasons I wanted to go to Drexel is that I, I knew that if I got a computer when I
[23:30.880 --> 23:35.760]  was a freshman, I certainly wanted it to be a Macintosh. Interesting. Oh, that's funny. I mean,
[23:35.760 --> 23:43.280]  my, my parents, uh, uh, tend to be, uh, more on the, uh, frugal side as well. We shall we say,
[23:43.280 --> 23:48.400]  um, and I know it's funny. I, I w I wouldn't not normally think of you as being frugal. Oh,
[23:48.400 --> 23:55.040]  I'm not. Nor, nor of myself. So it's just, it's, it's, we, we, uh, I think had a similar reaction
[23:55.040 --> 24:00.560]  to that. No, my sister is though. My sister's too. Oh, my sister is the same way. She's,
[24:00.560 --> 24:06.640]  she's incredible. That's funny. Yeah. Uh, you know, uh, you know, knows where everything is,
[24:06.640 --> 24:11.280]  you know, actually balances the checkbook, et cetera, et cetera. Knows, which store has,
[24:11.280 --> 24:14.960]  you know, certain items that are cheaper than the other store. Whereas I'm so grateful for,
[24:14.960 --> 24:19.360]  like, I honestly want to switch all my, all my credit card usage to American express, just
[24:19.360 --> 24:23.920]  because they actually, their Apple pay implementation actually shows every single
[24:23.920 --> 24:29.360]  charge. Whereas like I have, I also have like a couple other cards. They only show the charge on
[24:29.360 --> 24:33.840]  your phone when you charge it with your using Apple pay, but American express, every single
[24:33.840 --> 24:38.320]  charge with the card will show on your phone as a notification. Yes. Yeah. Which I think is great
[24:38.320 --> 24:42.320]  because I don't want to, I don't want to be bothered to like, go through my statement every
[24:42.320 --> 24:46.080]  month and make sure there aren't fraudulent charges. So like the fact that it pops up every
[24:46.080 --> 24:53.440]  time is fantastic. Um, it hurts me that only American express does that. Uh, I totally love
[24:53.440 --> 24:58.960]  that now. Is that, that, yes. And I, I, I know exactly what I was, where I was going with this.
[24:58.960 --> 25:06.640]  So that only works though with, um, with Apple pay, even though it, like you said, it, you have
[25:06.640 --> 25:11.920]  to have an Apple pay device. And that means, um, like for the couple of weeks over the last year,
[25:11.920 --> 25:17.200]  where I've switched back to my iPhone five S for testing, like when I first started testing iOS
[25:17.200 --> 25:24.000]  nine, I didn't want to put it on my six. So I put it on the five S and I swear not the size of the
[25:24.000 --> 25:29.920]  screen. It, the biggest thing that I missed was getting those, uh, Amex notifications. I honestly,
[25:29.920 --> 25:34.880]  if there was a day where I had my heart skipped and I thought, wait a minute, is this busted?
[25:34.880 --> 25:38.880]  I'm not getting, I was like, Oh, that's cause it goes through, it doesn't go through the Amex app.
[25:38.880 --> 25:44.160]  It goes through Apple pay and, uh, the, what they call the wallet now, but it used to be called
[25:44.160 --> 25:49.680]  pass book. Well, it's wallet in, is it not still pass book and I will say it, which by the way,
[25:49.680 --> 25:55.600]  um, I, I've never re yeah, it's gotten a, I haven't put it, I haven't installed iOS nine yet. I
[25:55.600 --> 26:00.000]  never installed anything early. You're smart, but I'm so used to iOS nine that I'm talking about it
[26:00.000 --> 26:05.840]  as though it's the present version. It's that, but I mean, pass book has gotten, um, even,
[26:05.840 --> 26:09.920]  even on our state, it's so much better than it used to be. Uh, I've been, I've actually been
[26:09.920 --> 26:15.120]  pretty impressed with it. Dude is iOS nine fixed the, uh, removing flights or hotel stays that
[26:15.120 --> 26:20.720]  you've already done like in the past? No, I don't think so. Ah, that's like the one killer, but like
[26:20.720 --> 26:24.720]  the whole like do them automatically. Yeah. Cause they stay in there. You have to, you have to
[26:24.720 --> 26:28.560]  dismiss each individually, which if you're traveling with your family and you have like four,
[26:29.680 --> 26:32.800]  if you have four tickets on your passport, you have to go through and dismiss each one
[26:32.800 --> 26:36.960]  individually, which is really annoying. But that said, the way, the way it like uses location
[26:37.520 --> 26:42.000]  and time data to like have the thing, they're instantly available. Oh man. I've been very
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.680]  impressed and happy with it. Yeah. I really, really missed it when I went back. Uh, so anyway,
[26:47.680 --> 26:52.480]  that's how I got started with the Mac in 1991, even though I knew it from the eighties, you know,
[26:52.480 --> 26:56.160]  from having used it, it spent some time on it in high school. What about you?
[26:56.160 --> 27:03.200]  Uh, I, I started out with, uh, when I went to school, I built my own PC. Um,
[27:03.840 --> 27:08.320]  and I actually started a little business on the side, putting PCs together for, for people I was
[27:08.320 --> 27:14.160]  like, you know, Michael Dell prodigy or something. Um, but, uh, no, I, so I put together my own PC
[27:14.160 --> 27:18.240]  and upgrade it with different parts and all that. That was that. I did that all the way through
[27:18.240 --> 27:25.520]  school. And then, uh, I didn't get a Mac. I got a Mac when I came to Taiwan in 2003. And I think
[27:25.520 --> 27:30.640]  I had a laptop that I bummed off like an ex-girlfriend or something. I think it was broke
[27:30.640 --> 27:35.360]  and like, if I fix it, can I have it? Um, and, and I did fix it and then she wanted it back and
[27:35.360 --> 27:39.120]  then I had it. And you'll say at some point she gave me my ex-girlfriend. I don't think it was
[27:39.120 --> 27:46.240]  about that. Um, but, uh, but yes, around that time, actually it was when the, uh, the first
[27:46.240 --> 27:53.120]  like flat screen iMac came out. Uh, not the, not the, not the one with the arm, the one where like
[27:53.120 --> 27:58.880]  the screen was the computer. Um, it was all white and like, I just thought that was just awesome.
[27:58.880 --> 28:05.760]  Uh, and I'd used a Mac a bit, um, in, in, in school, but I mean, mainly at the newspaper
[28:05.760 --> 28:11.840]  to do layout, uh, but, uh, but not, not much, but I thought that computer was so cool and I liked it
[28:11.840 --> 28:16.240]  so much that I ended up buying an iBook. I don't know. I don't know what happened in the transition
[28:16.240 --> 28:20.080]  of buying that, but I mean, I was, I didn't have any money then at all. I think it was probably
[28:20.080 --> 28:25.200]  just a matter of that was, that got me in the door. So that was when Tiger, around Tiger,
[28:25.200 --> 28:28.560]  I think actually I think it was Panther. I think Tiger came out like a couple months after that.
[28:29.200 --> 28:35.120]  And, uh, and yeah, I use a Mac pretty much since then I was the, you know, head of like the Mac
[28:35.120 --> 28:39.760]  club at Kellogg, like cause back, um, you know, helping people like actually Kellogg being a
[28:39.760 --> 28:43.920]  business school, you know, they provided, they had windows PCs, but to use a Mac, you know,
[28:43.920 --> 28:48.080]  it was a little, a little more difficult. And so it kind of blew everyone's mind when I left
[28:48.080 --> 28:53.440]  Kellogg to go work at Microsoft because I was kind of known as the, the Mac Apple guy. Um,
[28:54.160 --> 28:59.680]  but, uh, but yeah, Microsoft was good. Windows, Windows, I think, um, it's, this is really
[28:59.680 --> 29:04.240]  interesting actually. Windows isn't that, isn't that bad. There's things I like about it better
[29:04.240 --> 29:07.840]  than, than a Mac. Um, some of the window management stuff I think is really, is actually
[29:07.840 --> 29:13.440]  pretty great. And actually I've installed a couple of utilities on, on the Mac to, to replicate some
[29:13.440 --> 29:16.400]  of it and what it's called better snap tool. It lets you basically move windows around with
[29:16.400 --> 29:22.320]  the keyboard. Um, it's, it's pretty great. Um, there's a free, free endorsement. Uh,
[29:23.120 --> 29:27.760]  the problem with windows, and this is kind of counterintuitive, was the app situation,
[29:27.760 --> 29:34.080]  application situation, like the third party apps just all sucked. Uh, obviously the Microsoft apps
[29:34.080 --> 29:39.280]  were good and much better on windows and they are there on the Mac, but things like, um,
[29:39.280 --> 29:46.560]  OmniFocus or, uh, or like a Twitter app, like just all this like basic stuff. Uh,
[29:46.560 --> 29:51.360]  the Mac was even back in back then, um, was, I guess it wasn't that long ago, but it was so
[29:51.360 --> 29:57.760]  much better than, than the window situation where everything at best you could find something third
[29:57.760 --> 30:02.000]  party, but it'd be super ugly. Um, you know, it just looked like crap and they'd have like
[30:02.000 --> 30:08.080]  the monetization would be weird. Um, that, so actually the biggest problem I had with using
[30:08.080 --> 30:13.120]  windows was not windows. It was not having enough apps, which was, which at the time I told some
[30:13.120 --> 30:16.480]  people that and they like totally didn't believe me. Oh no, that's the big advantage windows has.
[30:16.480 --> 30:21.440]  But even by then for a consumer sort of, I wasn't consumers working in enterprise, obviously, but,
[30:21.440 --> 30:28.000]  but for personal app usage, uh, the situation was, was pretty dire even then. And obviously
[30:28.000 --> 30:32.240]  it's, it's only gotten worse since then. Yeah. Have you ever used a Moom?
[30:32.240 --> 30:37.680]  It's a couple of these utilities, M O O M. I haven't, I don't use it. I don't,
[30:37.680 --> 30:41.520]  but if I were to use a windows management utility, that's probably what I would get.
[30:41.520 --> 30:48.000]  I'll put some links in here. It's just another, uh, utility, you know, I, I kind of agree. I
[30:48.000 --> 30:52.480]  don't, I don't use any third party utilities for that anymore, but, uh, I do kind of agree
[30:52.480 --> 30:57.200]  that managing a bunch of open windows on OS 10 with the stock stuff is kind of
[30:57.200 --> 31:03.280]  convoluted. It's kind of hard. Once you used to use the snapping stuff, it's, it's,
[31:03.280 --> 31:10.640]  it's pretty awesome. I haven't used, I haven't used windows since like, I think I used it for
[31:10.640 --> 31:20.000]  like a few weeks on a contracting job in 2000. I don't know. Yeah, no, which is, which is,
[31:20.000 --> 31:27.200]  I mean, once I left, I mean, I went, I went right back to, I went, I went right back to the max.
[31:27.200 --> 31:31.440]  Do they still, they still have like the C drive, right? Like if you buy,
[31:32.080 --> 31:35.600]  if you buy like a brand new like windows machine, you still have like a C drive, right?
[31:36.480 --> 31:41.600]  They do. I think it might be less exposed. Like I think, you know, your default view
[31:41.600 --> 31:45.440]  in the Explorer is, is more like, you know, your documents and pictures and stuff like that.
[31:45.440 --> 31:49.600]  But that said, there's the aspects of windows, the windows Explorer app, like the actual file
[31:49.600 --> 31:56.640]  management that that are better than the Mac. And like the way you can have, I mean, maybe it's more
[31:56.640 --> 32:00.720]  power user stuff, but you can actually view the tree and like the left and like have the apps on
[32:00.720 --> 32:05.040]  the right, or you can like cut and paste, like, just, I don't know. I think it's one of those
[32:05.040 --> 32:11.520]  things where, where if you're always used to the finder, you can, you can, you can, you know,
[32:11.520 --> 32:17.200]  where if you're always used to the finder, you would think it odd, but if you've used it the
[32:17.200 --> 32:21.920]  other way, I don't know, I definitely, we will never finish in 90 minutes if we get started
[32:21.920 --> 32:25.600]  on the finder, because I'm still not used to, I'm still not used to the OS 10 finder.
[32:26.640 --> 32:31.600]  If you're used to the real finder from the classic Mac OS, then it's all,
[32:31.600 --> 32:34.720]  it's all just ugly and brutal. That's where the action was.
[32:34.720 --> 32:42.400]  Well, I think in general, it is Mac OS users and people who like the old finder and spatial finder
[32:42.400 --> 32:47.840]  or what up, it seems to me tend to be more mouse centric in their usage of the computer.
[32:47.840 --> 32:52.800]  It would, was that a fair characterization? I don't think so. I think for some people that
[32:52.800 --> 32:59.200]  is true, but like I wasn't. And once you learned some of the keyboard shortcuts for the old finder,
[32:59.200 --> 33:05.120]  it was, it was great. You, you know, just a command up would go up a, up a five, you know,
[33:05.120 --> 33:09.600]  up a level command in the list view, which is what everybody, you know, everybody's smart used.
[33:09.600 --> 33:15.360]  You could command left and right to close up, open and close levels of hierarchy and option
[33:15.360 --> 33:22.800]  command left, right to do the whole, you know, subfolders too. And you can type ahead and you
[33:22.800 --> 33:26.720]  could type ahead to select, you still can, a lot of these things still work, but in the old finder,
[33:26.720 --> 33:32.720]  it never screwed you over and it kept stuff open and you could do stuff like, you still can,
[33:32.720 --> 33:36.880]  but like just start typing the first few letters of something and it selects the first thing that
[33:36.880 --> 33:40.720]  matches the first few letters without entering any kind of command or anything. You just type it.
[33:42.240 --> 33:46.880]  I don't know. I learned to use the keyboard very, very quickly with the old finder and it was always
[33:46.880 --> 33:51.760]  very fast and it never felt like I had to wait for anything, but that's a, that's a, that's another
[33:51.760 --> 33:57.360]  show. I'll save that show for when Syracuse is on. Yeah, I was gonna say, I think my, my perspective
[33:57.360 --> 34:04.480]  is, is distorted by having him talk about the find, the spatial finder, kind of, it's kind of
[34:04.480 --> 34:10.000]  kind of been a multi-decade campaign at this point, I think. Yeah. Well, and we didn't even
[34:10.000 --> 34:19.680]  talk about Chromebooks either, which I actually do really like. What else? What do you remember?
[34:19.680 --> 34:24.400]  You were using Windows when the Windows 95 came out. This week was the 25th anniversary of,
[34:24.400 --> 34:28.400]  of Windows 95. No, cause I, I didn't, I didn't have a computer cause I was in high school.
[34:29.280 --> 34:35.360]  So when I got a computer or when I built my computer, I think that Windows 98 had either
[34:35.360 --> 34:41.600]  just come out or was about to come out. So I think, yeah, I think I started with Windows 98.
[34:42.720 --> 34:48.880]  I'd used Windows 95, but no, I wasn't part of the whole line up and do it. I was following,
[34:48.880 --> 34:53.520]  like I was following the news at, by that point, I think I had subscribed to actually,
[34:53.520 --> 34:57.840]  I think I had actually subscribed to some computer magazines when I was still in high school.
[34:57.840 --> 35:01.440]  Like we did those old like fundraising drives, you know, where you sell magazines door to door.
[35:01.440 --> 35:07.520]  Oh yeah. Just in retrospect, just kind of ridiculous. But so I was, I was subscribed
[35:07.520 --> 35:13.040]  to a few of them, so I definitely followed it even from afar, but no, I was not a part of it.
[35:13.040 --> 35:19.920]  But I, I did enjoy your, your, your YouTube linking in response to it.
[35:21.520 --> 35:25.680]  It was something, I thought it was, I still thought it was garbage. It was just better
[35:25.680 --> 35:32.160]  looking garbage than Windows 3.1. It did well. I mean, it did stop your eyes from bleeding,
[35:32.160 --> 35:37.360]  but it did actually manage memory competently. This is more than you could say for the Mac.
[35:37.920 --> 35:42.720]  Well, you know, but the Mac, at least, I don't know. I've favored user interface design over
[35:42.720 --> 35:48.560]  lower level, you know, Mac OS of the era definitely had problems and it was showing its
[35:48.560 --> 35:53.680]  age. But I would say 1995, it wasn't quite even there yet. I would say at that point, there were
[35:53.680 --> 35:58.400]  still advantages to be had by having an operating system that was so low to the ground that,
[36:00.000 --> 36:05.840]  you know, that memory wasn't managed like that. Right. Well, I think it's, it speaks to how good
[36:05.840 --> 36:10.240]  the user interface was that, I mean, I mean, people talk about Apple dying, but the fact that
[36:10.240 --> 36:16.800]  they didn't die speaks to how good it was because the reality is on almost every conceivable metric
[36:16.800 --> 36:22.080]  or feature angle, I mean, the Mac was pretty hopelessly behind. It was way more expensive.
[36:23.520 --> 36:33.200]  Yeah, that was really, I think that it, by 96, 97, it was, the fact that the operating system was so
[36:33.200 --> 36:40.640]  crufty under the hood and that memory was all shared was definitely a problem that they knew.
[36:40.640 --> 36:43.440]  And that's why, you know, that it came to a head and that's why they bought next.
[36:44.800 --> 36:50.000]  But the machines of the time were not unusable. They weren't bad. I mean, you know, you could make
[36:50.000 --> 36:54.480]  them bad though. That was one of the things that people got like, and if you used a stock Mac,
[36:54.480 --> 36:59.680]  this is the thing that people don't remember. If you used a stock Mac and you did not install third
[36:59.680 --> 37:05.120]  party extensions, you would have a stable, a pretty stable experience. The thing that
[37:05.120 --> 37:11.200]  really kind of did that in were web browsers. It was even the good ones at the time had a
[37:11.200 --> 37:16.000]  tendency to really lock up your machine. But the people who would complain and say like,
[37:16.000 --> 37:21.840]  I had a Mac in 1994 and it crashed all the time, they installed all of these system extensions
[37:21.840 --> 37:25.600]  that were all running in the same memory space as everything else. It was more or less like
[37:25.600 --> 37:30.640]  people were making their own operating system. Right. But that's a long story.
[37:31.600 --> 37:34.800]  Yeah, we're doing everything we can to not meet our goal.
[37:37.520 --> 37:45.440]  You mentioned before, let's move on. Let's talk about the Apple Watch and the Taptic Engine.
[37:45.440 --> 37:51.040]  I think that among the top problems with Apple Watch now low these many months in,
[37:51.040 --> 37:55.200]  I think the Taptic Engine is one of the top problems and probably the only hardware problem.
[37:55.200 --> 37:59.200]  Well, no, I guess I have a second hardware problem. I have a list of three top Apple
[37:59.200 --> 38:03.200]  Watch problems and one of them is the Taptic Engine, which I don't think is good enough.
[38:04.560 --> 38:08.640]  Yeah, what's interesting is I think that's arguably the killer feature of the watch.
[38:09.360 --> 38:14.640]  Like that was what I missed the most when I didn't have the watch for three days was
[38:14.640 --> 38:20.960]  back to buzzing in my pocket. Like that was really annoying. And I think the Taptic Engine
[38:20.960 --> 38:28.160]  is great. And so yeah, I think the fact that it's a hardware problem is magnified by the fact that
[38:28.160 --> 38:36.000]  it's so, I think, central to the value that the device does provide. Which to me is all about,
[38:36.000 --> 38:41.040]  you know, is the notifications and some of the complications. I have said for a long time and
[38:41.040 --> 38:45.680]  maintain that it was a mistake to launch with these hybrid apps. I think they just ruin the
[38:45.680 --> 38:50.880]  user experience. But the Taptic Engine is great, except for the fact that, especially in the
[38:50.880 --> 38:59.280]  US, it seems to be failing for a lot of people. Yeah, I think that, do you think that's true?
[38:59.280 --> 39:02.400]  Do you think it's a lot of them in stainless steel? Because that was what my review unit
[39:02.400 --> 39:06.000]  was that had a bad one. That's what, I mean, based on Twitter responses, I mean,
[39:06.000 --> 39:11.440]  when I posted that mine is failing, I got quite a few responses and it seemed to be all stainless
[39:11.440 --> 39:15.920]  steel models that were having problems. And if you remember, I think it was the stainless
[39:15.920 --> 39:20.320]  steel models that were the most delayed too, getting out the door. Remember there was the
[39:20.320 --> 39:27.520]  story about like one supplier of Taptic Engines, you know, they had bad ones. So I don't know,
[39:27.520 --> 39:31.760]  there seems to have been, there seems to be some sort of common thread here involving the
[39:31.760 --> 39:38.400]  stainless steel models and the Taptic Engine and there being a problem. I think, I think that
[39:38.400 --> 39:43.440]  there's too many people who've had them fail. Maybe not so much that it really hurts the
[39:43.440 --> 39:49.040]  platform, but it's obviously a problem. And I think even in the ones that don't fail,
[39:49.040 --> 39:56.400]  it's not good enough. And I could be wrong because it was one afternoon, 11 months ago,
[39:57.200 --> 40:04.480]  only 11 and a half months ago now, when I first got to see the prototype late pre-production
[40:04.480 --> 40:09.520]  Apple watches that they had at the event last year, you know, six months before they actually
[40:09.520 --> 40:14.160]  shipped. But what I recall from the ones that I got to put on my wrist there, the Taptic
[40:14.160 --> 40:22.160]  sensation was better and it wasn't, it was just, it was just more satisfying. It felt more like a
[40:22.160 --> 40:28.480]  tap. Whereas this, and more like something that you couldn't miss. Like they, the ones that they
[40:28.480 --> 40:33.600]  had a year ago just seemed to me like they had like hit this sweet spot between, you're not
[40:33.600 --> 40:41.680]  going to miss this, but this isn't going to startle or annoy you. It was just, it was very
[40:41.680 --> 40:46.960]  humane is the best way that I could put it in the way that if I, if I were standing behind you and
[40:46.960 --> 40:50.640]  you were talking to somebody and I needed to get your attention, I could tap you on the shoulder
[40:50.640 --> 40:56.960]  in an appropriate way, depending on the urgency of the matter. Like, is this seriously an emergency?
[40:56.960 --> 41:02.320]  I could, you know, I would tap you more aggressively if it was just, I do hate to
[41:02.320 --> 41:05.360]  interrupt, but I just want to let you know, I have something for you. I would tap you in a certain
[41:05.360 --> 41:10.480]  way on the shoulder and you could interpret that. The watches I remember from September just sort
[41:10.480 --> 41:15.680]  of had that. And I really thought this, this is a huge aspect of the thing. Whereas the watch I wear
[41:15.680 --> 41:22.960]  now, I just, I do miss taps. I don't think I I'm, in fact, I know that it's not defective. I don't
[41:22.960 --> 41:28.000]  think I, I don't have a watch with the defective taptic engine. It just isn't that great though.
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.880]  And I feel like it needed to be, or it needs to be. And I feel like it's one of those things that
[41:32.880 --> 41:37.600]  the next generations, they're going to figure something out to do it better. Yeah. I think
[41:37.600 --> 41:41.760]  the, it's interesting. I think my new watch actually, I feel it's not as good as my original
[41:41.760 --> 41:45.040]  watch when I first got it. Again, it's hard to measure because you're, you're going based on
[41:45.040 --> 41:50.720]  memory. But the, so the way it failed was it went from feeling like a tap to feeling like a
[41:50.720 --> 41:56.560]  vibration. Like, so it was like it was getting loose or something. And so, and that had less
[41:56.560 --> 42:01.440]  of a sense of the tapping because it's just kind of just this buzzing on your wrist as opposed to
[42:01.440 --> 42:05.840]  being that very distinct tap. And I do think my new one, well, it's tighter than the one that
[42:05.840 --> 42:14.160]  was failing. It still feels more vibratey than like a tap that, that I, that I recall. Again,
[42:14.160 --> 42:19.680]  I recall this from when I first got it or if it was from the event also. But yeah, I think that,
[42:20.800 --> 42:26.960]  yeah. And it's interesting. I was, I'm curious if the smart ones are different or the sport ones
[42:26.960 --> 42:33.280]  are different. But like I said, it's my, it's, it's my favorite feature. So hopefully they do
[42:33.280 --> 42:40.960]  clean it up. All right. I need to sneak in here and thank our next sponsor. And it is
[42:42.160 --> 42:49.440]  our good friends at Hover. Hover is the best way to buy and manage domain names.
[42:50.080 --> 42:55.120]  They're a domain name registrar. That is like the, one of the dirtiest rackets on the internet.
[42:55.120 --> 43:01.360]  Hover is above the board. These guys do it the right way. These guys are like the apple of
[43:01.360 --> 43:06.400]  domain name registrars. And they have a great deal. Remember this, keep this in mind. You get
[43:06.400 --> 43:14.000]  10% off your first purchase at Hover using a special code that I will tell you in one minute.
[43:15.200 --> 43:21.840]  Here's just a couple of points though about Hover. You want to secure a great domain for your idea.
[43:21.840 --> 43:27.760]  They have tools you search like the name of the project or the company or the app or whatever it
[43:27.760 --> 43:32.000]  is you're working on that you want a new domain for you. They give you the tools to help you
[43:32.000 --> 43:37.440]  search for it and find either the closest and best combination of two words that have a.com
[43:38.000 --> 43:44.400]  or it help you find an alternative to.com. That's a top level domain. Whichever way you want to go
[43:44.400 --> 43:52.000]  to find a domain. Hover has amazingly good tools to help you find it. So you want to get a good
[43:52.000 --> 43:56.720]  domain name. Hover has you covered there. You want to take all the hassle and confusion out of the
[43:56.720 --> 44:03.280]  process of registering it. Hover's got you there. You want easy to use tools like a dashboard for
[44:03.280 --> 44:09.920]  managing your domains. They've got it. They've got a great simple interface. Really, really good.
[44:10.480 --> 44:16.880]  In less than five minutes, you can find a domain, pay for it, sign up and get access
[44:18.560 --> 44:21.760]  to everything you need to control it and get it pointed at your website.
[44:21.760 --> 44:26.640]  All from Hover's dashboard. Really, really great stuff. If you have to register a domain and you
[44:26.640 --> 44:33.440]  don't use Hover, you are not hooked up right. If you've ever registered a domain anywhere else,
[44:33.440 --> 44:40.000]  you know that companies make it really unpleasant. Not only do they make it hard to buy what you want,
[44:40.000 --> 44:45.360]  but if you ever want to move it somewhere else, boy, that's really where they make it hard. It is
[44:45.360 --> 44:49.840]  exactly the same sort of process that like when you want to call up your cable company and you
[44:49.840 --> 44:55.600]  want to switch to Fios or something like that and they give you the run around and they won't just
[44:55.600 --> 45:00.480]  disconnect your service. That's exactly what it's like moving domains from some of these
[45:00.480 --> 45:05.200]  domain registrars. Well, guess what? It doesn't have to be that hard when you go to Hover because
[45:05.200 --> 45:12.080]  Hover has an amazing service that they call valet transfer. So if you're a Hover customer,
[45:13.600 --> 45:16.960]  this is all you do. You give them your credentials, your login credentials for the
[45:16.960 --> 45:23.440]  old registrar where your old domains are. And for free, absolutely free, you skip the hassle
[45:23.440 --> 45:26.720]  of moving them over yourself. They know all the tricks that these guys pull. They know exactly
[45:26.720 --> 45:31.120]  how to get there and just get it done and they know how to do it the right way so your DNS
[45:31.120 --> 45:36.240]  is all pointed the right way and nothing gets, you know, there's no hiccups in the transfer.
[45:36.240 --> 45:41.360]  You just give the customer service reps at Hover what they need, the information they need from
[45:41.360 --> 45:46.720]  your old registrar and let them go. And the next thing you do is you give them your login credentials
[45:46.720 --> 45:51.680]  and the next thing you know, all of your old domains are all in your Hover account. One place
[45:51.680 --> 45:57.440]  with all your domains with the same great interface and service. Really, really great.
[45:57.440 --> 46:02.080]  When you do buy new domains, they don't do any of this heavy-handed stuff, no upsells, no charging
[46:02.080 --> 46:06.800]  you for stuff that shouldn't be there. Are they the cheapest? No, they are not the cheapest,
[46:06.800 --> 46:11.840]  but that's exactly what drove this whole domain name registrar business into the ground is this
[46:11.840 --> 46:16.960]  race to the bottom in pricing and then that's where they turn to all these upsells and hidden
[46:16.960 --> 46:23.760]  charges. Hover's prices are great though. They're really competitive and it includes everything you
[46:23.760 --> 46:29.040]  need or want, you know, who is privacy. Everybody should have who is privacy. There's no way that
[46:29.040 --> 46:34.880]  any registrar should be charging for this. Who doesn't want who is privacy on the the name and
[46:34.880 --> 46:38.400]  phone number and stuff like that that's associated with the domain name registration?
[46:38.400 --> 46:44.480]  Well at Hover, that's just built in. So they have great customer support, a great interface,
[46:44.480 --> 46:49.520]  great prices, great service, and a great track record. They've been around forever. They have
[46:49.520 --> 46:54.560]  great history. They've even got online tutorials and email support if you don't want to get on the
[46:54.560 --> 46:58.800]  phone and talk to somebody. So you can either help yourself or follow their instructions to do
[46:58.800 --> 47:04.160]  whatever it is that you want. So here's what you do. When you want to get a new domain name
[47:04.160 --> 47:09.920]  or you want to sign up and switch your old domain names over, go to hover.com, h-o-v-e-r.com,
[47:09.920 --> 47:20.880]  and you'll get 10% off using the code 3starpodcast. That's t-h-r-e-e-s-t-a-r-p-o-d-c-a-s-t. Love
[47:20.880 --> 47:28.400]  these guys. You can tell they listen to the show with the goofy domain names that they pick or not
[47:28.400 --> 47:35.440]  domain names but coupon codes. Although I'll bet 3starpodcast.com. I wonder if that's taken. Maybe
[47:35.440 --> 47:41.040]  I should look into it. My thanks to Hover. And if you need a domain, go check it out.
[47:42.800 --> 47:46.800]  What are your other two problems? Well, actually, I'm going to renumber them. And I'm going to say
[47:46.800 --> 47:50.960]  that Taptic Engine disappointing, I'm going to number that number two. I'm going to say number
[47:50.960 --> 47:57.920]  one is that apps are slow. And whereby apps, I mean, anything that goes between the phone and
[47:57.920 --> 48:04.000]  the watch. Not just third party. I think the third party stuff is really just embarrassing
[48:04.000 --> 48:10.640]  as the months go on. It's unusable. And some days, it just seems worse. But then even the built-in
[48:10.640 --> 48:15.360]  stuff, it can be. Sometimes it's like it just works and you're like, this is the future.
[48:15.360 --> 48:20.160]  And other times, it's like I hit the little temperature thing on my face to open a weather
[48:20.160 --> 48:26.400]  app and it just spins and spins and spins. Weather is too slow. Yeah. And I've got a good connection.
[48:26.400 --> 48:34.640]  I'm at home and Wi-Fi. Everything should work just fine. And something somewhere, it doesn't work.
[48:36.160 --> 48:40.400]  So I have two comments on that. One, I agree about weather being way too slow.
[48:41.200 --> 48:45.760]  And it's frustrating. Two, the other thing that's really irritating is weather doesn't update based
[48:45.760 --> 48:49.920]  on your location. You have to open up the watch app in your phone and change the default city,
[48:49.920 --> 48:56.000]  which to me seems like such a miss. I mean, I'm sure it'll be fixed, but it's like, because I travel
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.480]  a lot, so I have to deal with this relatively regularly. One thing that's great about the Apple
[49:00.480 --> 49:06.400]  Watch is I made a travel face, basically, where I was leaving from Chicago. I had the Chicago time.
[49:06.400 --> 49:10.160]  I had Tokyo time where we were switching planes and I had Taipei time where we're going.
[49:10.160 --> 49:14.320]  And I also had the chronograph to measure how long we'd been flying and the timer to measure how long
[49:14.320 --> 49:20.000]  until we were supposed to land. It was awesome. I usually will fly with the little computer,
[49:20.640 --> 49:26.800]  the flight path in front of me, just mainly to see that all the time. But the watch was actually
[49:26.800 --> 49:32.720]  way better because I could immediately see the time whenever I wanted. So it's almost a great
[49:32.720 --> 49:39.360]  travel thing. I just wish it would update when you get there. Third, I'm going to say, this is one
[49:39.360 --> 49:45.920]  that does not affect me, but it absolutely affects Amy, my wife. Workouts kill the battery.
[49:47.200 --> 49:53.440]  She, and it's one of the, and it's clearly, it's heavily advertised as a reason to buy the watch
[49:53.440 --> 50:03.040]  is as a workout measuring fitness companion. And it just, she goes to the gym and she comes back
[50:03.040 --> 50:09.840]  and she could leave with a hundred percent charge and comes back and her watch is under 50%. And
[50:09.840 --> 50:15.680]  then not with, without enough to get to the end of the day. So I don't know if it's, you know,
[50:16.480 --> 50:20.080]  the exact type of workout she's doing. I don't know if other ones, I think the fact that hers
[50:20.080 --> 50:28.880]  is 38 instead of 42 has a factor in that. But that's a real, like one day of, of battery life.
[50:28.880 --> 50:33.280]  It does seem like that's, you know, it seems crazy compared to what watches were like before
[50:33.280 --> 50:37.040]  Apple watch, where you have to charge your damn watch every night and that can be a problem.
[50:38.560 --> 50:44.160]  But it's it, when it works, it seems like, yeah, that's, I can get used to, I can handle this.
[50:44.160 --> 50:48.240]  This is okay. But if you can't get through the day, it's a deal breaker and doing a workout
[50:48.880 --> 50:52.720]  and having it not get through the day is, is a real, it's a real problem. I think.
[50:52.720 --> 51:00.960]  Yeah. My last item is sort of a sub item of the apps or slow thing. It might be related to why
[51:00.960 --> 51:06.160]  sometimes they get slow. I think that the, there's a, sometimes there's a finicky connection between
[51:06.160 --> 51:11.760]  the watch and phone. And I feel like it has to be ideally, especially for the prices they're
[51:11.760 --> 51:17.280]  charging it, it really ought to be a hundred percent thing. Like when you connect a keyboard
[51:17.280 --> 51:25.040]  to a Mac through USB, it always works, right? Like you, if it doesn't, you know that you just,
[51:25.040 --> 51:30.640]  you've got a bad keyboard, right? USB or Bluetooth? USB. And, and, and, and I think it's blue. I think
[51:30.640 --> 51:35.200]  Bluetooth is the reason that, that this watch, you know, but that's, that's not my problem. Right.
[51:35.200 --> 51:39.120]  You know, if you've spent a thousand dollars on an Apple watch, the fact that Bluetooth is very
[51:39.120 --> 51:44.000]  difficult to program and has all sorts, you know, whatever, not your problem. It should,
[51:44.000 --> 51:49.760]  it should be work as reliably as USB as plug. Let me guess you, you, you wear your watch on
[51:49.760 --> 51:55.040]  your left wrist and put your phone in your right pocket. I do. Yep. That I'm sure that's why,
[51:55.040 --> 52:00.800]  because the human body is a it's like, you know, we're a big, big sack of water. You know what,
[52:00.800 --> 52:06.080]  though? My wife has had more problems than me with this, including recently, and she does,
[52:06.080 --> 52:10.640]  she seldom carries her phone in a pocket. It's usually, you know, in her purse or,
[52:10.640 --> 52:16.480]  or something like that. She doesn't usually keep it in a pocket. And it's, and sometimes it's like,
[52:16.480 --> 52:20.640]  it just says like, they're right next to each other. And not often, not often, but like,
[52:20.640 --> 52:24.720]  it was just like a week or two ago, but her phone and her watch, and she isn't running any beta
[52:24.720 --> 52:30.160]  software on anything. She's not running OS betas. But her, her watch was showing the,
[52:30.160 --> 52:35.040]  I can't see the phone icon, you know, the red, the red, scary red icon, and they're right next
[52:35.040 --> 52:39.680]  to each other and getting them to see each other again. It's the best thing we could figure out to
[52:39.680 --> 52:48.240]  do was to reset her watch, and then restore it, repair it, restore it from the backup that she
[52:48.240 --> 52:53.680]  had on the phone. It just seems like something you should never have to do for for a while.
[52:53.680 --> 52:59.680]  Yeah, that's pretty bad. Yeah. And it was weird. It was like, you know, that the magic repairing,
[52:59.680 --> 53:07.280]  like where you point your camera at the at the cool animated QR code equivalent, but that they
[53:07.280 --> 53:12.320]  made look not ugly. If that wasn't working for like, for, and even though I know that that's
[53:12.320 --> 53:16.880]  because I was there with her when she paired it originally, it and it was, you know, in any kind
[53:16.880 --> 53:20.960]  of lighting, like really good midday lighting with lots of sunshine just wasn't working.
[53:22.960 --> 53:27.520]  She had I had the I couldn't get a parent when I was at the Apple store, get my new one.
[53:28.880 --> 53:34.240]  For some reason, the genius ended up doing it. And I just think that it's got to and I think
[53:34.240 --> 53:38.080]  Apple probably I think that they're aware of this because I think that's how high their aspirations
[53:38.080 --> 53:43.680]  are. But all these little fiddly little problems are fine for something like the pebble that's
[53:43.680 --> 53:48.320]  aimed at a certain like that sort of people who pebble advertises to. And when you charge the
[53:48.320 --> 53:55.200]  sort of prices that pebble advert, you know, charges, people, you know, this sort of finicky,
[53:55.200 --> 53:59.680]  trying to get one piece of technology to talk to another is just what we're used to. And that's
[53:59.680 --> 54:08.320]  acceptable. I think that Apple has raised the bar with so many other things in their ecosystem. And
[54:08.320 --> 54:16.480]  with the pricing that they charge, and the sort of, you know, consumer accessible luxury message
[54:16.480 --> 54:18.880]  that they're putting forth, that's it's just not acceptable.
[54:20.160 --> 54:25.200]  It's interesting you talk about the luxury angle, I will say the beyond the apps, which again, I
[54:25.200 --> 54:32.880]  think I feel like the fact that it shipped these hybrid apps, it was very concerning to me, as what
[54:32.880 --> 54:38.960]  it says about Apple as a whole, like who someone should have said no to that. That aside the luxury
[54:38.960 --> 54:45.040]  angle like the biggest issue I have with the watch, and I've still worn it every day and I
[54:45.040 --> 54:51.840]  missed it when it was gone. But is I do, I'm not like a some watch connoisseur, I only have one
[54:51.840 --> 54:57.840]  Swiss watch that I got for my wedding for my in-laws. But I miss wearing it like I miss going
[54:57.840 --> 55:03.120]  into like, I can go into a nice store and I can be dressed, you know, jeans and a shirt. But, you
[55:03.120 --> 55:08.800]  know, if you're wearing like that nice watch, like it's, there's a certain sense of feeling that
[55:08.800 --> 55:13.600]  comes from from that. And I don't get that from the Apple watch. I have the stainless steel with
[55:13.600 --> 55:18.080]  the stainless steel band, you know, it's, you know, relatively high model, but it definitely
[55:18.080 --> 55:24.880]  it definitely, well, I absolutely think that it looks a lot better than the competing smart
[55:24.880 --> 55:31.200]  watches. And that's fine. I guess people may agree or disagree. It still feels pretty geeky and not
[55:31.920 --> 55:35.920]  not like a luxury item, even if it's the quality is nice, the workmanship is nice.
[55:36.640 --> 55:43.120]  I miss not having that luxury item. And I don't know, I'm wearing it anyway. Parks,
[55:43.120 --> 55:48.160]  I'm a geek in part because like I said that I find the notifications and the net or I'm more
[55:48.160 --> 55:54.480]  fine than not buzzing in my pocket. Really nice. But I get what they're going for with that. I,
[55:54.480 --> 55:57.840]  at least for me, I'm not sure that they delivered on that specific point.
[55:57.840 --> 56:02.960]  Yeah. You're just traveling. How do you how do you find traveling with the Apple watch?
[56:04.000 --> 56:09.680]  No, it's great. Like I said, I find it. I think it's great because the multiple watch faces you
[56:09.680 --> 56:15.600]  can set like I set up like a custom watch face just for just for the trip, which was super,
[56:15.600 --> 56:21.120]  super valuable. And because I'm lazy, I don't have zero battery life issues. Even flying that
[56:21.120 --> 56:28.400]  26 hour trip, you know, no, no problem as far as battery life goes. It is true. If you don't do a
[56:28.400 --> 56:35.440]  workout, it is. It does get outstanding better. I find that it's half great for traveling and half
[56:35.440 --> 56:40.160]  terrible for traveling. And I'm not sure. Interesting. So like, I do think that the
[56:40.160 --> 56:46.560]  directions are pretty great. We just had Oh, see, I never use that because we just had to
[56:46.560 --> 56:52.560]  drive somewhere and we don't have like a dashboard GPS type thing. I find getting the directions on
[56:52.560 --> 56:57.040]  my wrist while I'm driving the car to be just terrific. Absolutely terrific. And I know I'm
[56:57.920 --> 57:03.520]  thinking about it. You know that it's going to tap me when I got a turn coming up and I can glance
[57:03.520 --> 57:08.560]  glance and see it. It's really really like it for that. I like it for little things like as
[57:08.560 --> 57:13.600]  convenient as it is if you've got like a boarding pass on the watch in a way like you said with
[57:13.600 --> 57:19.040]  passbook that it just comes up like knows you're at the airport. And it just comes up because how
[57:19.040 --> 57:24.160]  many especially when you're traveling with kids. A lot of times your arms are full. Or you just
[57:24.160 --> 57:31.120]  don't feel like digging through it's it's pretty cool for stuff like that. Oh, I remember on Amtrak
[57:31.120 --> 57:37.120]  train the one time and that it's I had my boarding pass on the watch. And it's just so great because
[57:37.120 --> 57:41.840]  you're on Amtrak you are you sit down and you wait and they come around and get your tickets.
[57:41.840 --> 57:44.880]  And so instead of having to sit there with your ticket out or fish it out of your pocket or
[57:44.880 --> 57:49.440]  something like that you just show them your wrist and it's already right there. Really great. The
[57:49.440 --> 57:53.520]  thing I don't like about traveling with the Apple Watch is I really don't like having to set up
[57:53.520 --> 58:01.120]  another charger in a hotel. Oh, right. It really like when we were at Disney World last month, it
[58:01.120 --> 58:06.080]  really was it was like, I just gave up on I was like, I'm just gonna wear my old watch every day.
[58:06.080 --> 58:10.560]  I'm just just forget it. I'll put the Apple Watch back on when I go home because it just got to be
[58:10.560 --> 58:15.760]  too much where I just we just had too many. You know, three phones and three Apple Watches was
[58:15.760 --> 58:22.960]  just too much. Yep. Especially if you're if you're staying in an older hotel room that doesn't have
[58:22.960 --> 58:27.920]  many outlets or Yeah, exactly. Well, most hotels even you know, well, it is probably a factor of
[58:27.920 --> 58:34.000]  age. But you know, even it's at some nicer hotels, it's it's hard. The one we were at Disney had the
[58:34.000 --> 58:38.800]  additional problem where it was sort of like a lot of the sockets. They were loose. And so like,
[58:38.800 --> 58:42.560]  sometimes you'd have a charger in there and it wouldn't. But then it's like the three so we just
[58:42.560 --> 58:46.480]  have like a tangle of these white cables, you know, and it's like you just look for a lightning
[58:46.480 --> 58:51.760]  or the thing and you plug it in. And what happened to me the one day is I had I attached it to the
[58:51.760 --> 58:55.040]  thing and I went to bed and I woke up in the morning and it was dead. And I was like, what
[58:55.040 --> 58:58.480]  the heck had that happened? And I like started pulling on the thing and it wasn't plugged into
[58:58.480 --> 59:04.720]  anything. It was right. It was just an unplugged in Apple Watch charger. And I was like, you know
[59:04.720 --> 59:09.200]  what the hell with that. I'm putting this away and I'll wear it when I go home. Yeah, no, that's
[59:09.200 --> 59:13.120]  definitely that's definitely a good point. And I think it's kind of a one that one of those ones
[59:13.120 --> 59:19.120]  that Yeah, we'll never go away. It does give me anxiety. Think about it. It gives me anxiety.
[59:19.120 --> 59:26.560]  Here's the anxiety I get. The anxiety I get is then when I don't wear it, and we're at the
[59:26.560 --> 59:34.320]  theme park and I walk 10 miles, I'm not getting any points. That's like the game of vacation is
[59:34.320 --> 59:42.480]  working against you. Yes, absolutely. Yeah. Which it's funny the the the whole like, I haven't
[59:42.480 --> 59:49.760]  turned any of those notifications off. The the I will tell you the our notification to stand up
[59:49.760 --> 59:54.560]  is really irritating when you're on a plane. But I still but I haven't turned it off. I think
[59:54.560 --> 01:00:00.640]  because out of some misguided notion that this is going to, you know, that it would be bad for
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:08.800]  my health to turn it off, even though like I never listened to it. But I think I've talked about this
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:14.880]  on the show before I think that and again, I say this knowing that famous last words is trying to
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:20.320]  tell some engineer what seems like it should be easy. So I'm not gonna say it should be easy. But
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:26.560]  it seems to me like it should be possible for the watch to make a very educated guess that you are
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:33.680]  on an airplane. Because it it knows when you're at an airport. Right? And it's that's good point.
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:41.600]  Right. And especially if it knows that it has a passbook, or as it's now called an iOS nine wallet
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:50.240]  entry for a flight. And it knows what time the flight is. And if it can somehow then I don't
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:57.040]  know, I guess it doesn't have an alt altimeter. Right. But there ought to be some, it just seems
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:00.800]  to me like there ought to be some kind of way that it can figure out that you're probably on a plane
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:05.440]  and maybe it could even ask you maybe they could even say are you going to be on a plane? Are you
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:10.080]  getting on this flight and then not ask you for that. I have to admit that that is I find that to
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:14.880]  be terribly annoying too. Because especially like in this, you know, second, third, fourth hour of
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:18.400]  a flight when you're really starting to get antsy and you're like, I just wish this goddamn plane
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:23.120]  would get to where it's going. And then your watch is like stand up, move around. And it's like,
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.840]  screw you Apple. You know, I'm so what I laugh at your second, third, fourth hour characterization.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:38.080]  Right. After my 13 hours flight yesterday. Two, the standing indicator like can't figure out
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:42.240]  whether you're actually standing or not either. It just goes at the 10 minutes to the hour,
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.320]  no matter what. Which is kind of annoying when you're walking around, it taps you on the wrist
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:50.960]  to say, hey, you ought to stand up. That's seems, but that's weird though. Sometimes it seems to
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:56.640]  know that you have been standing and it doesn't show it to you. I don't get it every hour at the
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:02.880]  15 minute mark. I get it. Who knows? Maybe, maybe, maybe I don't. But there are some times when I am
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:08.640]  up and I get it. And then it's like, come on. I don't know. Anyway, that's, those are my top
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:15.040]  complaints about the Apple watch. Yeah, no, I think that it's all fair. I, for the record,
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:21.120]  remain, remain pretty bullish on it. Just because I think, you know, the, the arc,
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.320]  the arc of technology. One thing I think is interesting is even when all these apps are
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:28.160]  coming, I'm still a little skeptical about the app situation. I think I'm going to say this on
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:33.680]  the show previously that, you know, kind of what matters on for one area doesn't necessarily matter
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:36.880]  the next one, just because apps matter on the phone. I don't think it's necessarily the case
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:43.440]  they matter for the watch. Where I think the watch remains super compelling is, you know,
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:49.440]  as a way to interact with the world around you, you know, and like when you can start your car
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:54.560]  with it or unlock doors with it or identify yourself with it. Like that's when it's, it's
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:03:00.640]  becomes just a must have and really transformed what you do. In the meantime, Mike, I've been very
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:08.640]  pleased with the notification stuff. And yeah, I just wish that, I just wish that Apple, they just
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:11.920]  shouldn't have shipped the third party apps at all. But I've said that like four times and you
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:17.200]  haven't taken the bait yet. So I'll let it be. I know. I mean, I, I, I even asked Shiller about it
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:21.600]  in the live show, you know, was it, you know, what was the thinking if you knew you were going to
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:28.720]  have this fuller SDK just a few months later, even though, yes, announcing it in June doesn't mean
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:32.720]  it's shipping. It's not going to ship presumably until next month in September. But even so,
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:39.520]  if, if the, if that 1.0 watch kit had never existed right now, people would be, there'd be
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:44.240]  some jackass out there writing articles and having written them all summer that Apple watch is dead
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:49.760]  because it doesn't have any third party software. But in the grand scheme of things, it would have
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:55.360]  only gone five months without. Right. Without. And, and saying something is like, like in,
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:59.040]  in all the reviews would have dinged the Apple watch for it, but I'm like, oh, but of course
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:04.800]  it will be rectified soon. Like that's a very different than like, the watch is slow. Because
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:10.400]  like I, if you don't interact with the apps at all, the watch in my estimation is perfectly
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:16.400]  acceptable. And the new Apple, that's not quite so secretive. The Apple that had, um,
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:27.440]  Jeff Williams at Recodes conference in late May, just say that he could, you know, coily say that,
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:32.000]  uh, and this ties in with what you want to talk about with the, that cars are the ultimate mobile
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:38.800]  device. You know, more or less not saying, yes, we're working on a car, but really towing,
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:45.200]  getting right up to the line. Um, right. I think that that Apple today's Apple could have also
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:50.640]  said at the exact same event, you know, maybe at Recode that, yes, we were working on an SDK for
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:55.440]  Apple watch and we'll have, you know, stay tuned for WWDC next month. Right. You know,
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:59.840]  no, I totally agree. It could have come out, you know, and it even could have come out,
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:04.320]  maybe it could have even come out at the, when they had the event in March where, you know,
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:08.320]  the second event where they, you know, seeded the things and even said, you know, and, you know,
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:13.200]  stay tuned, you know, for WWDC and we'll have, you know, this thing. Well, and not just, not just
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:17.840]  that, but like, this is, that's what Apple does. Like you, I mean, when you're, uh, I'm sure it
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:23.040]  probably irks you that one of your, one of your best articles is not on daring fireball.com. Oh,
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:29.520]  I've said that before. Yeah. Um, the one I've made that mistake once. Yeah. The macro one,
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:35.840]  like this is how Apple rules, like their version ones are supposed to be under, under featured.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:43.280]  Like there's, there's, there's a, there's two like things that a product should be measured on. One
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:47.360]  is the features, but the other one is, is like how done it is, like how complete it is. And by
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:51.680]  complete, I don't mean that it's fully featured. I mean that the features that are there work
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:57.680]  perfectly. And like what Apple's always been good at is yes, we'll, this is a version one.
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:01.360]  It's going to be missing a lot of stuff, but whatever is there is going to work really,
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:06.240]  really well. I remember the iPhone one like that, that is arguably the most stable iPhone of all.
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:10.640]  Right. I mean, that, that thing was, was incredible for what it was, even though it was
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:17.280]  missing all kinds of like basic stuff, you know, copy and paste and all that, all this very stuff
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:23.440]  that we can all name. Um, but what was there worked perfectly better in general, at least
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:29.680]  in Apple's mindset to ship without a feature at all than to ship with a crappy version of the
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:35.040]  feature. Exactly, exactly. And that's what so irks me about the watch or concerns me as an
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:43.360]  Apple observer is to me, the app situation is, is adding it because to check a box and it's adding a
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:49.200]  poor implementation of it, instead of taking the lumps for, you know, in reviews for missing
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:55.440]  something, um, it added something in it and added it poorly. And that's, and they, that's a problem.
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:59.840]  Yeah. It's almost like they took somebody at Apple and who knows, maybe everybody was in agreement
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:04.960]  and there wasn't a fight about it, but it seems to me like something that maybe was an internal
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:10.720]  debate that there were, had to be some people in there who thought the same thing we do. And it
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:18.080]  makes me think that the faction that won out and shipped it, um, took the wrong lesson from the
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:22.080]  iPhone because famously, and we know this in hindsight and famously with the original iPhone,
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:29.600]  um, it didn't ship with a SDK. And I don't think it would have under any circumstances,
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:34.160]  even if the whole company was a unanimous that we need to have apps for this thing,
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:39.040]  just like we do for the Mac in 2007, that still wouldn't happen. Cause the OS was still,
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:43.840]  they didn't, they weren't ready to have public APIs. And that's one thing Apple's always,
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:48.480]  or at least the next slot side of Apple, even actually even the non next side,
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:52.800]  I think it's been pretty good about over the years is that they, you know, once they publish
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:57.120]  APIs, they're pretty, you know, pretty good about supporting them going forward until
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:03.520]  they're deprecated. They don't really change things like that. Um, but famously, you know,
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:09.360]  there were people on Steve jobs was on that side of it that really thought that they didn't need
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:13.680]  apps that this, you know, we, we can do all the apps we need, that it would more or less be like
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:18.080]  what Apple TV has been up till date. We're not that they wouldn't have new apps going forward,
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:21.280]  but they would be things like the YouTube app where they would do them in partnership
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:26.480]  with somebody else. And that if maybe if there was a Netflix app, two years later,
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:32.720]  Apple would write the Netflix app and put it on the phone and with API help from Netflix and stuff
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:37.440]  like that, that they could just do it all themselves and have a dozen, you know, a couple
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:43.120]  of dozen apps and that right, fine. And that the other side was, no, we should, you know, open this
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:47.600]  up and have an app store. And they looked at how this went and how the app store was. So, you know,
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:55.440]  has now become so essential to the success of the iPhone and the iPad and just blindly said,
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:59.280]  well, therefore we need to do this for the watch and we need to have it right away.
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:08:59.780]  Yep.
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:02.020]  I agree.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:07.680]  Yeah, I, yeah, I'm trying to think which apps I use. I use overcast sometimes,
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:10.000]  but that's about it.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:18.400]  I don't, I don't use a single one. I tried the, I tried the SPG wire or keyless entry. But,
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:23.520]  yeah, it was too much hassle. You have to go into the apps and you have to click it.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:27.200]  Like it would work better if they had like a beacon or something. So it came up automatically.
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:30.880]  That would be awesome. And so that's going to be like my whole vision about like having your
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:36.480]  watch do stuff for you. It was great for Apple pay on the watch is great. You know, just double
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:41.280]  click it and do it. It needs to be that easy to have your watch interact with the environment.
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:46.400]  Actually, I have to open up the app screen, find the SPG app, open it. Then you had to
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:50.560]  click to unlock key. Like it was a multi-step process that was totally not worth it.
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:55.680]  On the phone, on the phone, the phone worked great. Because maybe just because the phone's
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:03.120]  faster, you still had to open the app. But yeah, other than that, I haven't really touched an app
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.960]  at all in a long time.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:11.120]  Yeah, I very seldom go back to that app screen. And just for example, like to time this 90
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:15.040]  minute episode of the talk show, I wanted to run the timer on my watch. And the way I run a timer
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:23.120]  is I know that third over from the left is the chronograph watch face. And I can, which I love
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:27.040]  for doing timing, because I just don't have to launch anything. There's a button right there
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:28.960]  on the watch face that starts at stopwatch.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:36.240]  Yep. No, I put timer and I have timer and alarm on my watch face. And those are that's what I
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:40.720]  use by far the most. As far as applications go. And they work well because they're native
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:49.280]  to the watch. Like there's no lag in using them. They work quickly. Yeah, so it will be
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:54.720]  interesting long term though. I mean, I think that we'll see what happens with these version
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:11:01.440]  two apps. I'm, um, I'll be interested to see which ones break through if, if, if any.
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:04.080]  Oh, you know what? I was going to stop. I was going to move to a new topic. But the
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:08.160]  other thing I knew I wanted to say something. I'm so glad you said that is that I'm thinking
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:15.040]  this is my hunch and I can't, I don't have concrete examples, but I, my hunch though,
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:21.920]  is that the third party key isn't the app, like the, the delivery, whether it's technically
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:28.720]  in code that's in a dot app bundle, that doesn't matter, but it's the concept of an app. What
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:34.080]  faces a user and in iOS parlance and app is a thing that is an icon on the home screen and
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:37.840]  you launch it and then it gets the whole screen and then you interact with it until you hit the
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:44.080]  home button and go back to the home screen that is full of apps. And Apple watch has that,
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:47.840]  right? They have this thing full of apps and you launch it and takes over the screen. I think I
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:55.840]  just think it's the wrong metaphor, metaphor. Yeah. Or package. It's to me, what's interesting
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:00.800]  and what works best from third parties right now are the notifications and the ones that are smart
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:06.480]  and that you can tap and get a list of buttons that give you options to do things like with the
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:10.800]  do app that I use for certain reminders. And I have you, have you tried outlook yet from
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:15.360]  Microsoft, the email client? No, they have an excellent Apple watch app actually, for that
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:20.400]  exact reason, you get a notification on email, you scroll down and there's archive, delete,
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:24.800]  delay to later, or like whatever, whatever the actions you want to do on an email. And yeah,
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:29.760]  it's all within a location layer. And so actually that is actually an application that I use,
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:33.440]  even though I never actually launched the application. Right. You're not really using it
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:37.920]  in the app metaphor. You're using it in this notification metaphor and you don't, you know,
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:42.320]  the people who put that together, aren't writing a whole app. They're just saying, okay, after this
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:47.600]  notification, here's a list of the actions we want to present. And then you do these actions and yes,
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:52.880]  they've written an app that has code that when you say archive knows and, you know, it tells the app,
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:57.920]  okay, take that email message and move it to the archive folder. But it's it from the user,
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:03.200]  it doesn't feel like using an app. And the other thing that I think might be a big deal with watch,
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:10.880]  watchOS 2.0 are the third party complications. Yes. Being able to put those complications on
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:17.360]  your watch faces, I think could be a real step up. And within a month or two, everybody is going to
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:21.200]  be like, I can't believe we lived without this because I've got my favorite thing. You know,
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:25.200]  I've got my Yankee scores right here on my watch or whatever your favorite thing is.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:31.200]  Then again, again, that's not really, that's not an app. It's not using it as an app. It's using
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:36.320]  it as this little thing on a face that you can tap and launch the app, but that you don't really
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:45.440]  think of it that way. Yep. I think the key thing here is all of them are, and this is where the
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:51.200]  watch is compelling is the degree to which it integrates with like the external world,
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:56.080]  as opposed to being like all included into an app, like an app on a phone. What makes the phone
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:01.120]  amazing is the phone, anywhere you go, you're connected to the internet and all apps as you
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:10.640]  know, you've written about a ton, like, yeah, the web, you know, HTTP is thriving, even if www is,
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:15.280]  you know, kind of on the decline and mobile. That's what makes the phone remarkable is the
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:20.960]  way it keeps you connected to the internet everywhere. But that implies a different user
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:25.680]  experience where you're inside of an app because you're not actually inside the app, you're inside
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:30.080]  of Facebook, or you're inside of Twitter, or you're inside of whatever, you know, the New York
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:33.840]  Times or whatever, whatever it might be. Whereas the watch, if you think about that complication,
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:41.280]  what it's doing is that complication is putting the information into like your external world,
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:45.920]  or the notification is like interrupting what you're doing now. And the context that you're
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:51.760]  operating in is not contained within the device. It's like your world's context. And I think that
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:57.440]  hints at why I'm still both on the watch and why I think, you know, in the long run, this will be
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:04.640]  not just a luxury but much more of a must-have device is the degree to which it will let you
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:09.760]  like integrate computing with everything around you. The physical world, not just the virtual
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:14.560]  internet world. Well said. Let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor. It's our good
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:21.840]  friends at Warby Parker. Warby Parker believes that prescription eyeglasses simply should not
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:27.520]  cost 300 bucks or more. They bypass the traditional channels. And so higher quality, better
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:34.000]  looking prescription eyeglasses online at a fraction of the usual retail prices,
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:41.520]  starting at just 95 bucks. Their designs are vintage inspired with a contemporary twist.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:47.920]  Every pair is custom fit with anti-reflective anti-glare polycarbonate prescription glasses,
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:54.400]  lenses. Every pair comes with a very nice hard case and a cleaning cloth so you don't need to
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:16:04.080]  buy any overpriced accessories. And they now offer for our older friends, progressive lenses,
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:07.600]  aka bifocals, but you know, they don't call them that anymore because they, I don't know,
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:11.920]  they do some kind of fancy stuff with a computer to make the two lenses sort of blend together.
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:17.760]  Anyway, those are usually very expensive. Warby's progressive lenses started just $295,
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:22.240]  including the frames. They have a distance prescription at the top and a transition to
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:28.480]  a reading lens near the bottom. And their progressives are they call them digital free
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:34.400]  form lenses. That's the most advanced progressive technology, higher precision, and a larger field
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:40.240]  of vision than traditional progressive lenses. Buying glasses online sounds like it would be
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:43.920]  risky, right? Because it's like you go to a glasses store and you know, you start trying
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:48.400]  these things on and right there in the store while you're trying them on, you're going through
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:52.560]  a whole bunch of pairs and you're like this, that, this, that, looking in the mirror. Warby
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:57.920]  has you covered, makes it super easy. You go to their website and you pick out the glasses
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:04.320]  you like up to five pairs and they just send them to your house free of charge and you borrow five
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:11.600]  at a time, take them to your house, try them on at home, at your own pace, see which ones you like.
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:18.080]  And then when you go to buy them, you can use your computer's webcam and they have tools that
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:22.560]  help you do the things that, the things that, you know, it matters like how far apart your pupils
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:28.320]  are, you know, whether it's, you know, 17 millimeters or centimeters or 16 or something like
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:31.120]  that, they have a simple little tool. 17 centimeters, you're going to have a problem.
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:36.880]  Well, whatever, I'm not good at centimeters. You know, how far apart are your eyes? I don't know,
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:41.520]  two, three inches, whatever. 17 centimeters in inches, it would be seven inches.
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:46.560]  Well, I guess if you're a very large person. Yeah, or maybe if you're like walleyed or something.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.840]  Anyway, you just hold up a credit card, which is a standard size, and then the camera knows
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:56.400]  how big the credit card is and then it measures your distance. I've done it. I have these Warby
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:05.440]  Parkers. They're the best glasses that I own. And they're, you know, the distance thing worked great.
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:11.840]  It really feels like a real pair of glasses. So you can try them at home, see which ones you like.
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:17.920]  No obligation to buy. If you get five glasses at home and you don't like any of them, send them all
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:24.080]  back and there's nothing. You're out nothing except putting them back in the box with a
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:28.480]  prepaid label and dropping it off or doing whatever you have to do to get it back in the UPS's hands.
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:36.880]  That's it. They also have sunglasses, prescription, and non-prescription polarized sunglasses.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.680]  Anyway, oh, the last thing they want me to mention, and it is a great thing, is that they believe in
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:51.040]  giving back to the world. And for every pair of glasses Warby Parker sells, they give another pair
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:56.720]  to someone in need through a whole bunch of vision charities. You can check it out on our website
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:00.720]  and they list who they are, but they go all around the world. And it truly is a remarkable thing
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:05.520]  because just imagine what that would be like if you couldn't even see clearly and didn't have
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:11.520]  the money or the resources to get just a simple little $95 pair of eyeglasses that could fix the
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:16.560]  problem. Well, Warby Parker is working on that. So that's really great. They've been doing that
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:25.200]  for years. So here's what you do. Go to warbyparker.com slash the talk show, I believe.
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:33.200]  I'll correct that in a second if I'm wrong. But go there and check it out. And my thanks to Warby
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:34.400]  Parker. Great glasses.
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:42.080]  I will say I quick did the conversion of the centimeters to inches using Spotlight, which I
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:47.840]  used to be, speaking of third party resources, I used to be a huge launch bar user.
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:50.080]  Yeah, I can't get used to the life of that launch bar.
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:57.280]  Well, I was for a very long time. But basically what happened was their copy paste functionality
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:02.880]  had this weird bug for a very long time. Never complained about it. And so I gave up and ended
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:08.640]  up using another clipboard manager, which by the way, I will say that's the number one reason I
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:15.440]  don't use the Chromebook, which I always talk about loving more than I do is because I can't
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:22.240]  live without a clipboard manager. It's always something right. But so I tried out like what
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:28.240]  let me try just using this and using spotlight. I did have to add, I cheated because I'm not using
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:32.800]  pure spotlight, I added something called flashlight. So flashlight adds a bunch of
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:37.520]  additional functionality just to spotlight including the ability to like, like I can search
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:41.520]  directly in different domains or there's, there's all kinds of stuff that adds on to it to make it
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:46.480]  much more launch bar like with like a lot of custom actions that you can do. But I have to
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:50.560]  admit I'm, I've been with it for like six months now. I'm pretty, I'm pretty happy with it.
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:55.040]  I never heard of flashlight. I will put this in the, in the show notes.
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:58.560]  Yeah, I couldn't use straight spotlight. I have to have the stuff that flashlight adds.
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:02.800]  I'm going to put it in the show notes. Here I am. That's me pasting it into the
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:09.520]  show notes. So that gives it, I give it a 50% chance of making it into the actual show notes.
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:14.960]  How are we doing on time? We're running pretty long. We're at an hour and 16 minutes. So we
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:19.760]  have 14 minutes technically to do the rest of the show. I don't know. We might run slightly long,
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:22.560]  but that's not too long. We're not more than a minute longer.
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:25.760]  Oh, I really, I really generally do want to get your thing on this apple car thing.
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:31.680]  So here, here's, here's my, here's my conundrum in a nutshell with the apple car thing is the,
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:35.440]  the issue I have with obviously there's lots of smoke and think there'd be fire.
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:40.800]  There's two possible outcomes here. One is that apple produces like a normal car,
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:44.720]  which I think they could do a good job in electric car and be very competitive.
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:48.240]  Except that I have questions about the long-term trajectory of the car market,
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:51.840]  particularly with the rise of things like Uber and, and car sharing and that sort of thing.
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:22:00.080]  I think in the long run car ownership is likely to decline which seems odd to launch into that.
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:04.240]  The other option is do the self-driving car, which I think is, you know, is certainly the
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:10.160]  long-term trajectory, but then I question apple's competence in, in pulling off a self-driving car,
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:16.320]  which seems to fit much more to, you know, Google's strengths as particularly the,
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:21.600]  the data intensive approach they're taking to it. I, I just, I mean, clearly there's lots of,
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:27.200]  there's lots of smoke here, but it just I don't know. It doesn't seem to quite add up for me.
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:31.760]  I mean, maybe this comes from my, like I said, you've said use Apple Maps for the watch. I don't
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:38.960]  because it's unusable here in Taiwan. I tried it when I first got the watch and it, it told me to
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:46.400]  make two illegal turns, both of which have gotten me killed. So I don't know. So I, I'm, I'm baffled
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:50.480]  about the whole thing to be, to be honest, not baffled. I'm just, I can't figure out what I think.
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:57.280]  Trenton Larkin Just to rehash as of this recording we are recording on Wednesday, August 26 show
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:04.880]  probably be out tomorrow, but some of the smoke that's appeared in the last, over the summer is
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:10.000]  a whole bunch of hirings at apple that we, people have spotted from like LinkedIn profiles changing
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:17.680]  and, and et cetera of car people of various sorts. It doesn't even matter going through them one by
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:22.080]  one. It's a whole bunch of people with experience in the car industry or from Tesla or from BMW or
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:27.920]  what have you. And it doesn't make any sense for Apple to have hired all of them if they're not
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:35.280]  making a car or something car related. And then there was the thing who got that scoop where Apple
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:42.240]  is trying to book the Guardian did the Guardian. Yeah. At a test track that, and I took issue with
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:48.560]  it and just my point was that the Guardian's headline was something about Apple shows that
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:54.240]  Apple is working on an autonomous car. And I didn't see that as being evident that it was an
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:59.120]  autonomous car. Right. It could have been a normal car. Yeah. And what people said to me in response
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:06.320]  was that it's not just a test track. It's like a little fake town. This area called Naval base
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:10.320]  somewhere in San Francisco or something. And that it doesn't make sense for anything other than a
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:14.640]  Naval autonomous car. Because if you want to test a regular car, you can test that anywhere.
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:20.320]  I'm not sure that holds though, because I think Apple definitely wants testing area nearby. So
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:24.480]  the fact that they could get a test track in Detroit or something like that, that doesn't
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:30.960]  help them. And who knows, maybe there are some minor autonomous features, collision detection
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:34.400]  or something like that, that they're working on, but that it's not really a self-driving car.
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:38.720]  Because the thing to me, and maybe I'm wrong, I hope I'm wrong. I think self-driving cars
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:44.240]  sound great. I really hope that they come sooner than later. I hope, it sounds fantastic.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.520]  It just seems to me though, my gut feeling is that it's way off. That's really far off in the
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:58.640]  future. I don't know, 10 years old. It sounds like we're in the same boat here, which is interesting
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:02.480]  because some people, I mean like- It seems like we're far enough out that Apple wouldn't need to
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:07.520]  wait for that if they want to get into the car business and that they can do this iterative and
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:11.840]  get in and start figuring out how are they going to sell them around the country and the world.
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:23.360]  And get in and start doing that before they have the self-driving aspect down. And then come out
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:29.440]  with a self-driving car at the same time that they would have anyway. And on a longer scale,
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:33.360]  like what I was saying before about the app store for the iPhone, that it didn't make sense,
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:38.000]  even if they had been 100% internally committed, which they weren't, but even if they had been
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:44.400]  internally committed to, we should do an app store for the iPhone. It didn't make sense for them to
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:49.840]  wait until 2008 to ship the first one. The one that they shipped in 2007 was totally worth
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:53.840]  shipping when they did. I think it would be totally worth Apple, if they could, shipping a
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:26:01.760]  car in 2020 that is sort of traditional in terms of how you drive it and doing a self-driving car
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:08.080]  in 2025. I like that. That makes sense. And because there's still clearly a significant
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:15.120]  market for a car now. And for all the various reasons, like, I mean, beyond the, you know,
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:20.000]  Johnny Love's cars, but also just from a pure finance perspective, there's a lot to like about
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:26.320]  Apple doing a car. And yes. And the other thing is if they started out with normal cars, they could
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:34.560]  outfit those cars with all the sensors and stuff to start gathering data that would go into a
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:40.320]  self-driving car. Like what's, you know, Google can put a bunch of mapping cars on the road,
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:45.440]  Apple can, could theoretically get a bunch of like actual cars on the road, gathering data,
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:49.440]  improving, you know, their, their data set and their algorithms and that sort of stuff.
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:55.360]  That's having it, thinking of it as being a multi-stage process. That's one of the more
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:58.800]  satisfactory answers I figured. Thank you. This has been productive. I appreciate it.
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:03.840]  I just wrote them down, but I've had them in my head and it's dangerous for me to walk around with
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:07.120]  things like this in my head that aren't written down. So now I've got them written down, but I've
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:13.520]  got three reasons why I think it makes sense for Apple to be working on a car. One is financial.
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:18.960]  Cars are expensive and they are a big business. There are a lot, you know, millions of cars sold
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:25.680]  in the world and they sell for tens of thousands of dollars. So that's a good, and in general,
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:33.760]  that's a good business to be in. Two, the market is ripe for technical disruption. And it is,
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:39.120]  it's already happening with the move to, you know, electric drive trains and stuff like that.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:47.360]  Power sources and the way that drive trains are changing based on that. And self-driving is
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:50.960]  another area, you know, it's, I guess it's unrelated, you know, I guess you could have
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:54.960]  a self-driving car that runs on gasoline and you can certainly have an electric car that isn't
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:59.760]  self-driving, but that's two big areas though, where there's enormous technical disruption.
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:05.200]  And so it's time, you know, the market is obviously going to change. I think the car market
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:10.880]  is going to look a lot different in 20 years than it does now. And that's not necessarily true now
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:16.080]  from where it was 20 years ago, right? The top car makers today are pretty much the same ones.
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:20.560]  The top car makers 20 years ago, and the cars are technically very, very similar.
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:25.200]  I don't think that's going to be true 20 years from now. So it's a good time to get in.
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:34.240]  And like as a 2A sub point on that, when computers come into a new market
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:40.400]  and there's the old standbys and then there's the computer companies,
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:46.320]  it's the computer companies that seem to do better building the new, the old thing
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:52.720]  than the old thing makers are at computerizing their things. Right. So like the RIM example.
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:29:00.640]  Yeah, RIM is a perfect example where RIM built these phones and pagers and all of a sudden it
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:05.440]  got to a point where these things could be real computers. And I know that's sort of an arbitrary
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:09.440]  distinction saying that, you know, today's smartphones are real computers and they're
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:16.960]  RIM models from 10 years ago were not. But I stand by it. And that companies like Apple
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:22.880]  were better at making phones, even if like the, you know, famously, you know, like the first phone,
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:27.440]  you know, dropped calls a lot. And whether that was AT&T's fault or Apple's fault or whatever,
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:33.040]  Apple got better at making phone antennas a lot quicker than RIM got at building computers.
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:36.960]  You know, and I think that the same thing could happen with cars. If computing matters,
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:43.520]  if computing matters, I think Apple's going to be able to make a car easier than even BMW or
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:48.000]  Mercedes companies with good, you know, well-run companies with good histories are going to be at
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.000]  making computers. Well, there's, there's, oh, sorry, go ahead. Well, my third factor is very
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:59.600]  simple. The car market has always been for 100 years and counting a market where design matters.
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:05.120]  Yep. And that's plays into Apple's strengths. Well, not just that. So I would add a couple
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:09.920]  of things. When the rumors first came out, I wrote a very similar article, like saying there's
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:13.840]  actually a lot of things here that make sense. And I would, you nailed most of them. I would just add,
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:24.480]  from the design, design matters perspective, the making electric cars gotten a lot simpler.
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:31.600]  So, or electric cars relative to a mechanical car is a much simpler thing to build. Like electric
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:36.320]  motors are much more well, you're not, you're an actual car, like is a controlled explosion
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:42.480]  happening constantly. And so the level of refinement needed to build like a quality
[01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:47.440]  engine and all that sort of things is much different in a much different skill set than,
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:51.520]  than electric car where, so it's much easier to enter the market now than, than it was.
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:58.160]  And what happens is, you know, and I think you were driving at this because that having engine
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:04.560]  expertise and having knowing how to build a great combustion engine is no longer a price of entry,
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:12.160]  that changes what matters, the priority. So it used to be that you first off making a
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:16.880]  good engine was table stakes, and then you could get to the quote unquote user interface.
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:25.280]  But now that the engine is no longer a price of entry, what matters most has changes because
[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:30.400]  there's, there's no, there's, there's new table stakes. Just look at what BMW's name stands for,
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:36.320]  right? Bavarian Motor Works. Exactly. Exactly. And so this gets to my second point, which is that
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:41.840]  the reason why I think you said that the, the list of top makers will be very different in 20
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:47.760]  years than it is today is it's any time because of this fundamental change from, from mechanical
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:50.560]  to electric. And again, this is not even touching on the self-driving stuff, which I think you
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:56.640]  perfectly articulated is going to be a separate event because you have this shift from mechanical
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:03.360]  to electric. It's everyone's starting from the same spot kind of objectively. And this is like
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:07.840]  going to mobile, right? It wasn't everyone's like, oh, Microsoft missed mobile. Microsoft didn't miss
[01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:12.560]  mobile. They were on mobile earlier than anyone else. The issue was, is that what mattered in
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:18.320]  mobile, it was a brand new paradigm being good at the desktop. Didn't advantage you on mobile.
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:25.360]  In fact, if anything, it made Microsoft worse off because the temptation to, to take the
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:30.640]  desktop paradigm and stick it onto mobile was overwhelming. And that's exactly what they did,
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:34.800]  right? Windows mobile actually had a start button, a start button that you pressed with the stylus
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:42.320]  and it popped up a menu, like a windows 95 menu. And I think it's probably going to be the same
[01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:49.360]  challenge with. With cars, the mechanical, it's not just that the mechanical guys no longer have
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:55.040]  an advantage over the electric guys. It's that they're actually at a disadvantage because they
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:33:02.240]  will be much less capable of truly starting from with a fresh sheet and rethinking what a car means.
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:07.280]  And if electric, if you start with the idea that it's going to be electric car and all that other
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:12.320]  stuff that has to do with mechanical engine goes away, then yeah, you have something like Tesla
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:17.040]  having like a 17 inch screen in their car, right? Cause that's actually much more important. And,
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:22.800]  and I think that's a reason why in these big transitions, the, the big players actually
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:28.000]  end up completely transforming. Yeah. And look at my reasons. Number one,
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:32.720]  they're expensive and it's people spend a lot of money on them too. It's a market ripe for tech
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:39.120]  disruption three, it's a market where design has historically mattered. Those are the same three
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:45.600]  things going on with the watch. People spend a lot of money on the watch. It's ripe for technical
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:52.720]  disruption. And by what I mean by that is that we've reached a point where you can build a Unix
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:58.960]  computer that runs in a watch size device, which is, and that's networked, which is a point of
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:03.360]  disruption to the, you know, whether or not, you know, who knows, maybe the digital watches are
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:07.760]  going to die again. Maybe it'll be a fad like the eighties, but there certainly seems like it's a
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:12.880]  time for disruption because it wasn't possible before. And it is possible now. And three it's a,
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:16.720]  it's a market where design matters. Well, that's absolutely. I mean, I don't know that that's
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:23.200]  more true for any market other than watches. Maybe, you know, the only other thing you can
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:29.680]  compare it to would be women's fashion. You know, in terms of the importance of design
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:34.160]  and the incredible variety of it that's out there. So the exact same reasons I think that
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:38.800]  Apple got into watch market, exactly the reasons they'd get in the car market. And it's exactly the
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:43.520]  same reasons they got into the cell phone market. They're expensive. It's a market that's ripe for
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:51.200]  technical disruption in an area where Apple's expert and design matters. Well, I would add,
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:55.360]  I guess the thing I would phrase about the technical disruption, I would refine it further to
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:59.920]  say, it's not just that there's technical disruption. It's that what used to be a mechanical
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:07.440]  object is becoming a computer and Apple is a computer company. And a car today is a mechanical
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:11.680]  object with all these computers stacked on top of it. Like some models have like nearly a hundred
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:16.480]  microprocessors, but if you think like the reason why there's a hundred different ones that are all
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:21.920]  distinct and why it's hard for your typical mechanic to even service a modern car,
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:28.880]  is because they're all kind of tacked on, right? But if you start with the assumption that an
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:35.600]  electric car is a computer with wheels attached, then it becomes very obvious that a computer
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:41.040]  company is going to have an advantage in the long run. And that's the same with the phone.
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:48.080]  It was no longer a phone with calendar functionality or email functionality.
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:55.200]  It became a computer that could also make calls. And that flipping of the paradigm is what makes
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:36:01.600]  it an attractive market for Apple, for Google, for the big software companies.
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:07.600]  Yeah. And I think you're exactly right. And your example that the entrenched market leaders are
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:13.600]  the ones who have the hardest trouble zooming out far enough to go back and just start over,
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:18.160]  that the phone's best example that I can think of, and I know I've harped on this for years,
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:23.040]  is the fact that the iPhone doesn't have a green make a call button and a red hang up button.
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:27.360]  And I'm sure, in fact, I know I've mentioned it before, and I think people have pointed,
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:32.800]  there are certain phones that came out before that didn't have those things, but very few.
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:38.160]  It is, they're way off in a corner of phone history. Every single mainstream cell phone
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:42.400]  that was ever made before the iPhone had, in fact, the colors almost never changed.
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:45.840]  They had a green button to make a call and a red button to hang up the call.
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:52.800]  So getting rid of those buttons was just like a huge and really just relegating the phone to an
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:57.440]  app status. And I've said this before too, I think in hindsight, I think if there's a mistake that
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:03.840]  Apple's made in the, what's it been, eight years since the phone, I feel, I really wish that they
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:13.200]  would further reduce the magical nature of the phone app. I don't want, I would like to reduce
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:17.760]  an incoming phone call to the same sort of notification I get from anything else.
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:21.440]  Oh, totally. Well, why should it take over my screen and do, yeah.
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:26.240]  Like, sure, let me set a ringtone. So if I have the volume on, it'll play the ringtone,
[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:29.920]  but I don't want it to take over the whole screen. And if I have it on silent,
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:34.640]  I just want it to drop down a little window shade at the top. Phone calls are just not that
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:40.320]  important to me. So if anything, I feel like Apple has fallen behind in reducing the fact that the
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:46.480]  phone should be just an app. It still has a few magical features, like when you get a phone call,
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:51.040]  the way it takes over no matter what you're doing. But for the most part, and I don't think any of
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:56.080]  the existing phone makers would have made that jump. No, that's exactly right.
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:59.200]  They could have, but they didn't. Right. Well, that's always the thing,
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:04.560]  and this is why startups succeed and why incumbents fail. The incumbent usually has
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:10.240]  more experience, they have more capital, they have more money to invest, but all that pales
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:16.000]  in comparison to one, your incentives, and two, your kind of preconceived notions.
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:23.680]  When Microsoft came up, if you want to characterize the OS or computer as like a square,
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:28.560]  like make it a physical object, like they were motivated to make the most perfect square in the
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:34.480]  world that fit this new paradigm of a PC. The problem is when the phone came along,
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:39.280]  what you needed was a triangle and Microsoft was so invested in everything about their
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:41.840]  corporation and everything about their organization and their incentives were
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:49.360]  perfectly aligned to make the best squares in the world, which meant they viewed the triangle
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:56.640]  as an attempt to push the square into it. Whereas if you started from scratch with the triangle,
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:01.920]  it's not just that you are starting from the same place as Microsoft, so you have
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:06.320]  an equal chance to them. You actually have a better chance because you know what you're
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:12.240]  targeting and you don't have all that baggage and cruft. Famously with disruption, it's not
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:16.480]  just that Microsoft, there's a financial aspect where they want to keep the old financial stream,
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:23.440]  but it goes deeper than just finances. It's like the very way people think is conditioned for a
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:29.040]  certain view of the world and it's incredibly difficult to break out of that, particularly
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:34.320]  in a large organization where this stuff is embedded deep in the culture and the way people
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:40.480]  think about things. We've gone over 90 minutes, but I'm just going to call time out here and I'm
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:46.560]  just going to say that the remainder of the show doesn't count. I want to take a moment here during
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:51.200]  this time out and I want to thank our third sponsor and it's our good friends at Casper.
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:57.520]  Casper sells an obsessively engineered mattress at a shockingly fair price. Just the right sink,
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:02.400]  just the right bounce. They take two common technologies from modern mattresses,
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:09.040]  latex foam and memory foam, and they put them together for just the right version. You don't
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:13.680]  have to sit there and choose between four different mattress types. They've figured out
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:18.640]  one that's great and you just pick the size you want and that's it. That's all you have to do.
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:23.680]  It is so easy. That to me is like the best thing about Casper is that you don't have to sit there
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:29.200]  and think, well, do I want this one that has more memory or the one that has more bounce or
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:35.680]  whatever? No, they just figured it out. They figured out the right mix and that's it. Seems
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:40.240]  crazy. Seems even crazier than buying eyeglasses online, but they've got the same type thing.
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:46.560]  Look, you just call up, they send it to you. It's a risk-free trial. I think it's 100 days.
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:51.120]  It's something like that. Yeah, here it is. 100 days. You get 100 days with the thing.
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:58.560]  Buy a Casper mattress. 100 days. If you don't like it, ship it back to them. Their mattresses
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:05.200]  are made in America and their prices are just blow away good. Really just remarkable. If you
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:09.680]  don't believe me, go to a mattress store and try to find high quality mattresses at these prices.
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:18.160]  500 bucks for a twin, 950 for a king, and all the sizes in between are in between 500 and 950.
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:27.680]  It's an outstanding price point for a really good mattress. It still blows me away when I think
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:33.120]  about when they sent me one of these things last year. It comes in a little box. You cannot believe
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:39.440]  that there is a full-size mattress in this little box. It's got instructions. It kind of weighs as
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:43.840]  much as you'd think a mattress would weigh, but it is an incredibly small box because it doesn't
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:48.640]  have springs and stuff like that. That stuff is like ancient technology. It's all just foam,
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:54.000]  and they just somehow vacuum pack it into this thing. You put it in a room where you want the
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.400]  mattress. That's the most important thing. Listen to the box, and then you open the box the right
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:04.480]  way. It makes cool noise that I won't try to replicate as it just sucks in the air. Then,
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:10.800]  all of a sudden, boom, you've got a mattress in your room. It feels like you're living in
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:16.080]  Back to the Future or something like the future of Back to the Future, where you put a little
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:21.360]  pizza in the thing. Ten seconds later, you've got a full pizza, except instead of a pizza,
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:26.880]  it's a mattress. Does that make sense? I hope so. Could not be an easier way. I've got a whole
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:31.200]  bunch of tweets. I've been retweeting them. People are buying these things, and they all say the same
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:35.280]  thing when they tweet. They're like, I thought it was crazy to buy a mattress online, but I've
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:40.960]  been listening to this thing on the talk show, and I did it, and it is. It's a great mattress.
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:45.280]  I think, and I don't have this here in front of me. This might not still be true, but I believe
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:50.640]  it was true for a while. He said, if you live in Manhattan, you can get a Casper mattress delivered
[01:42:50.640 --> 01:43:00.400]  same day by some cat on a bicycle, which is crazy, absolutely crazy. So just dial it up at,
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:07.120]  which is their website. I think it's casper.com, but I do know the code. The code is the talk show,
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:14.560]  and you'll get 50 bucks off by using that code. So go to casper.com. Use the code,
[01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:23.040]  the talk show, and you'll save 50 bucks off. So my thanks to them. Let's wrap it up. We've got
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:31.120]  to wrap this thing up because timeouts can only last so long. I have one last thing that I wanted
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:38.480]  to talk about, and that was this Amazon thing in New York, New York Times. Did you see this?
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:48.080]  I did. I wrote a lot of a lot. I wrote two daily updates in an article. Yeah. So first off,
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:54.400]  I haven't written about it at all. So I'll let you talk. Well, first off, there was an article
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:44:00.960]  just today going on Twitter about someone who used to work for Amazon, who left on maternity leave
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:07.040]  and got cancer at the same time. And I saw that both got cut off from her insurance,
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:12.960]  and which was claimed to be a mistake. And then when it came back, all her direct
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:17.520]  reports were gone, and she was basically marginalized and resigned a few months later.
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:26.800]  And so I think just to be clear, that sort of behavior and all the kind of anecdotal allegations
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:34.560]  of treating someone with a miscarriage poorly, the cancer patient, that's abhorable and deserves to
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:41.440]  be condemned the strongest possible terms. And I will say, I believe that it happened because
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:48.080]  if you're in an environment where they're pushing so hard, if you're running right up to the line,
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:53.760]  you're going to go over it sometimes. So I actually tend to believe that there is some truth
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:45:01.440]  to that stuff. So that aside, just to be super clear, that shouldn't be tolerated. And I hope
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:09.200]  that this will produce changes. Secondly, though, the issue I had with the New York Times article
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:15.520]  specifically was, and this sounds really silly, but was the tone of it. There's all these kind
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:20.960]  of throwaway lines, basically kind of mocking the person who was so excited about getting a
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:25.040]  frozen doll to someone, or like, oh, they're working so hard so you can get scotch tape.
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:33.440]  Like, it was kind of the snark and the disdain and the condescension that I felt it had that
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:40.800]  really rubbed me the wrong way. And the reason it did was, the fact of the matter is, I know
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:44.800]  a lot of people that work at Amazon. I lived in Seattle. I personally chose not to work at Amazon
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:50.560]  because I had a family. And it's not great for that, by all accounts. Everyone knows that.
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:55.520]  But on the flip side, had I been single, I think I would have loved the opportunity. I love the
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:46:01.520]  idea of an environment where you should challenge something. If you think something's wrong, you
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:04.640]  stand up. If somebody has a bad presentation, you tell them it's a bad presentation. That happened
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:11.120]  to me at Apple. I got totally torn apart one time at Apple. And I think I did cry at my desk.
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:15.840]  And you know what? I came back, and it led to me doing some of the best work I've done in my career.
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:22.000]  And not only that, it instilled in me the understanding that you can dig deeper and
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:26.640]  go down a deeper level and get something better. And I think that plays out in what I do today,
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:31.600]  like really wanting to deliver something beyond, and I can trace it back to that happening.
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:38.400]  And I'm pretty hesitant toall these people are paid very well. They all choose to work there.
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:42.480]  They could all get jobs somewhere else. And I'm a little hesitant on my high horse and
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:47.040]  tellsay that I need to take care of them and what they do. If you want to talk to me
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:50.480]  about Amazon's warehouse workers, I'm happy to have the conversation, because they're in a much
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:56.480]  worse position. But the white-collar workers, that kind of aspect irked me about the article.
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:01.440]  You've covered everything I wanted to cover and put your finger on it better than me.
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:10.960]  I hear what you're saying about the condensation. You said that they're busing their asses for 20
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:17.600]  hours a day, answering emails after midnight to send scotch tape to people overnight or to do it
[01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:22.800]  in one day instead of two. And I agree with that. And I feel like that's sort of like saying that
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:29.280]  New York Times writers are busting their asses to send pulped-up dead trees to people every morning,
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:36.480]  365 days a year. You're kind of missing the point. It does make people happy when they have a good
[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:43.600]  experience with Amazon, where some pair of boots breaks and you can get the exact right
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:48.400]  pair of replacement shoelaces and they're there the next day. That's actually really cool.
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:53.920]  Whereas in pre-Amazon, or if Amazon doesn't have what you're looking for, where do you go to get a
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:59.040]  specific kind of shoelaces in the real world? They've made the world a better place. I know
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:02.960]  there's other places where you can buy shoelaces than Amazon, but Amazon's often the place I go to
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:08.560]  first. At the beginning, if you have a great service experience, it actually brightens your
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:13.760]  whole day. That thing you order something at Amazon and it shows up a day early, it's cool.
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:21.600]  It's okay that it's cool. We're humans. Not everything has to be eating our vegetables.
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:26.560]  And the other thing that really got me about it was the way that I thought the article really
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:33.040]  conflated entirely different aspects of it. Exactly what you said. If there are HR problems
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:41.520]  like a lack of tolerance, poor responses after a maternity leave or an illness leave or something
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:47.280]  like that, that's really bad. That's over the line and it's like a red alert going off. That's
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:53.920]  like a siren should be flashing. If it's that you had a crummy idea or poorly thought through idea
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:58.720]  and you were told this is a crummy idea and it's poorly thought through, that's harsh. And I've
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:03.680]  been there. I think everybody has. I've been there. It hurts, but it's the way it works.
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:07.520]  And I don't know how that's different than other companies. How is that different than Pixar,
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:14.960]  which has a famously ruthless, not ruthless meaning mean or personal, but just in terms
[01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:19.920]  of being really, really hard to get a story through and that they always say over and over
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:24.240]  and over again, everything starts with story and they have this story making process that's entirely
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:30.000]  collaborative and you have to keep coming back to the same group of your colleagues and peers
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:33.680]  and presenting your story and they're going to pick it apart and tell you everything that's
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:38.640]  wrong with it and you keep coming back. That's how they make Pixar movies. Like Pixar movies
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:42.640]  don't get made and they don't have the track record that they have of one hit after another
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:47.760]  by having story meetings where they want to make sure that whoever is presenting feels good coming
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:53.440]  out of it. Oh, totally. And Apple too. I mean, there's that anecdote. When I was at Apple,
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:57.920]  here Johnny I've speak and he shared it then, but it was repeated in that New Yorker article
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:05.040]  where I think it was coming out of a meeting and either I was asking Jobs why he was so critical
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:10.880]  or I've confided in Jobs that he was disappointed in the presentation. As I heard it in the story,
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:14.000]  it was I've confided in Jobs that he was disappointed in the presentation.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:20.720]  And Jobs said to him like, that was a very selfish thing to do. And I was like, what?
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:26.160]  I was trying to be nice to the guy. And Jobs is like, no, you were trying to make him like you.
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:30.720]  You were concerned about him not liking you if you were honest about the mistake. He's like,
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:34.400]  and actually you're doing him an incredible disservice and you're doing a company disservice
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:40.800]  and you should be ashamed of yourself. And I was like, he was super pissed at Jobs, he was saying,
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:47.600]  but it totally transformed the way he viewed his job and what he did. If he wasn't honest with what
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:53.760]  was in front of him, he was doing everyone a disservice in the pursuit of wanting people to
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:51:01.360]  like him. And that was just deadly for him and for the company and all that. And I mean, Bezos
[01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:06.240]  says he doesn't want to be like Microsoft, Microsoft being this infighting and all this
[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:11.600]  backbiting stuff. The reality is the old Microsoft, at least legend has it back in the 90s when Gates
[01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:19.920]  was there, vicious and vicious in a like, this sucks. It should have been better. And frankly,
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:26.720]  when I was there, the issue that I had with Microsoft was the reason I didn't get promoted
[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:33.360]  my first year was I was told my what was great, but my how was poor. Basically, I was told I was
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:41.520]  too blunt and people felt uncomfortable with what I said in meetings. And so what happened was,
[01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:45.040]  you do get the backbiting and viciousness because that always exists because we're humans,
[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:52.160]  but that all happens back channels and behind the scenes. Far better it happened in the open
[01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:57.040]  than in these back channels. And where Microsoft, I think, has gone wrong in some respects is all
[01:51:57.040 --> 01:52:02.320]  that viciousness never went away. It just got taken off the top table and being visible to
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:06.720]  everyone. It got stuffed underneath. And then you get this toxic environment that,
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:13.600]  I mean, needless to say, I left it for two years. But I don't know. Sorry. That was a bit of a rant.
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:18.560]  No, that's all right. One thing I remember as a last thought is I took a screenwriting class
[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:25.120]  in college and I enjoyed it greatly. And it was taught by a guy who used to work on ALF and he
[01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:30.160]  worked on a bunch of, you know, everything from PBS shows that were totally serious to like the
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:35.280]  ALF Saturday morning cartoon show. And he said that, you know, we had these crits every week,
[01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:39.920]  everybody would, you'd have to hand in your writing on a certain day. And then there were
[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:44.640]  copies and this is pre-digital and everybody got a copy at the end of the class. And then you'd have
[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:48.640]  to read it for the next class. And then we would each, we'd have a crit and everybody would discuss
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:54.480]  each other's work. And he said, this is how Hollywood works. You criticize the work, not the
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:59.440]  writer. It's not personal. You don't say you should have done this. You talk about like the
[01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:03.440]  character should have said this or the dialogue isn't right. You don't say, you know, like if you
[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:08.400]  and I had both written something and I wouldn't say, Ben, you did a crappy job with the dialogue
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:12.160]  here. You'd just say this line of dialogue doesn't ring true to me. It doesn't sound like
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:15.920]  something that this character would say. It's the work, not the person. That doesn't mean it
[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:20.800]  doesn't hurt when you walk away and you know that you've got a marked up screenplay that's full of
[01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:25.040]  really, really astute criticism, but it's not personal. Especially if you've invested yourself
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:28.640]  in the screenplay and that's where it's tough, right? Because the best work comes
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:35.120]  when you put yourself into it. And so to be able to manage someone criticizing your work,
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:38.960]  and they may be doing it correctly, but you identify so deeply with them that it's hard
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:44.160]  to handle. I get that. And yeah, no, I think we're on the same page. I get also the extra
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:49.680]  hours thing, but again, these are adults making well into the six figures, particularly including
[01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:57.200]  stock compensation. That's for them to decide. And the truth is, I don't know anyone who works
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:03.360]  at a successful tech company, particularly either one that Apple and Amazon kind of,
[01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:08.080]  they compete on the user experience, which requires that much more perfection and attention
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:12.960]  to detail, or the early stage of any company when they're building their competitive advantage.
[01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:22.560]  And maybe this is part of people's reaction. They don't want to admit that there's a choice. I do
[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:30.240]  believe you can't have it all. You can't be an attentive father or an attentive husband and be a
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:34.320]  senior vice president at Amazon. I don't think it's possible, or Apple for that matter.
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:38.160]  And it's something that I don't think we like to talk about because we like to think about
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:41.600]  Apple being this great company or Amazon being this great company. We love their products.
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:48.080]  I think there's an aspect of guilt almost that comes with these articles and is part of why
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:53.520]  people react so strongly to them. Yeah, I agree with that completely. Ben Thompson,
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:55:00.160]  I thank you for your time. People can find more of your writing at stratechery.com.
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:08.320]  And season two of Exponent, the next episode will be coming out next week. So I'm back in the
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:19.360]  podcast chair. That is your podcast co-hosted with James Allworth. You guys talk about basketball.
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:26.080]  No, we talk about basketball to the extent where I make fun of James for having no idea about any
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:32.000]  sort of sport. Did you see that, though, thatwhat's-his-name is back on Twitter, and
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:38.640]  the guy got fired from ESPN. Bill Simmons? Yeah, Bill Simmons. And he called out Steve Ballmer as
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:43.680]  being over his head on the Clippers. Yep, that wasI cannot believe I just blanked
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:46.880]  on Bill Simmons' name. That's what happens when you're 90 minutes into a podcast.
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:52.640]  Anyway, thank you. I will let you go and talk to you soon. I look forward to hearing the next
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:56:04.000]  episode of your show. Sounds good. I'll see you soon. All right.
