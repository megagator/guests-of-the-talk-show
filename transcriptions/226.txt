[00:00.000 --> 00:01.400]  All right, this is unfamiliar.
[00:01.400 --> 00:02.760]  I don't know if I sound right.
[00:02.760 --> 00:04.220]  I'm not using my microphone.
[00:05.280 --> 00:06.400]  I'm not using my headphones,
[00:06.400 --> 00:08.480]  although they are identical to my headphones.
[00:08.480 --> 00:11.200]  And I'm not even using my own computer.
[00:11.200 --> 00:15.400]  I have a review unit, 15-inch Core i9,
[00:15.400 --> 00:19.040]  the most controversial computer in the world in front of me.
[00:20.240 --> 00:21.800]  And I'm not even in my house.
[00:21.800 --> 00:23.840]  I'm here with Marco Arment
[00:23.840 --> 00:27.880]  at his bizarre summer home in New York.
[00:27.880 --> 00:31.520]  And not coincidentally,
[00:31.520 --> 00:33.840]  our guest this week is Marco Arment.
[00:33.840 --> 00:35.440]  Marco, welcome to the show.
[00:35.440 --> 00:36.280]  Thank you very much.
[00:36.280 --> 00:39.040]  I love recording shows with somebody in the room,
[00:39.040 --> 00:41.600]  although I can't, I can see you,
[00:42.680 --> 00:45.720]  but I do feel like the dynamic is always a little better.
[00:45.720 --> 00:48.640]  And I say that knowing that 98% of my shows
[00:48.640 --> 00:50.320]  are entirely over Skype.
[00:51.400 --> 00:52.920]  You're just throwing the rest of your shows under the bus.
[00:52.920 --> 00:54.520]  I am.
[00:54.520 --> 00:56.440]  We're gonna tell you why all the other episodes of this show
[00:56.440 --> 00:58.840]  are less good than this, really.
[00:58.840 --> 01:01.320]  But I have no concerns over audio drift,
[01:01.320 --> 01:03.840]  no concerns over Skype dropouts.
[01:03.840 --> 01:05.640]  So it should be pretty good.
[01:07.960 --> 01:09.520]  So I guess that the biggest story,
[01:09.520 --> 01:11.760]  I haven't done a show in like four weeks,
[01:11.760 --> 01:14.960]  so it's been a long hiatus over the summer.
[01:14.960 --> 01:18.080]  I've been vacationing in various ways.
[01:18.080 --> 01:19.680]  Biggest story clearly to have dropped
[01:19.680 --> 01:22.200]  since last I recorded a show
[01:22.200 --> 01:25.720]  is that Apple has come out with an all-new lineup
[01:25.720 --> 01:29.640]  of touch bar MacBook Pros.
[01:30.760 --> 01:32.920]  Every MacBook Pro with a touch bar has been updated,
[01:32.920 --> 01:35.800]  and the one MacBook, quote, pro,
[01:35.800 --> 01:38.440]  without a touch bar, the...
[01:38.440 --> 01:39.320]  The MacBook escape.
[01:39.320 --> 01:41.520]  The MacBook escape, for lack of a better term,
[01:41.520 --> 01:43.800]  is as yet untouched,
[01:44.720 --> 01:46.240]  and the regular MacBooks are untouched.
[01:46.240 --> 01:51.240]  Presumably updates to those will be coming in the fall.
[01:51.640 --> 01:52.480]  But I don't...
[01:52.480 --> 01:53.320]  Do you think they're finally,
[01:53.320 --> 01:54.440]  like there's been these rumors about like,
[01:54.440 --> 01:57.200]  new MacBook Air replacement or something like that?
[01:57.200 --> 01:58.920]  My theory is that the MacBook Air replacement
[01:58.920 --> 02:01.800]  is just gonna be a new configuration of the MacBook escape.
[02:01.800 --> 02:03.560]  But do you think they're finally gonna
[02:03.560 --> 02:04.840]  give it a different name
[02:04.840 --> 02:07.040]  so we can stop all this nonsense about like,
[02:07.040 --> 02:09.600]  this is the touch bar MacBook Pro versus the touch,
[02:09.600 --> 02:12.000]  versus the MacBook Pro with two Thunderbolt 3 ports,
[02:12.000 --> 02:13.080]  versus like it's...
[02:13.080 --> 02:14.880]  The naming is such a mask.
[02:14.880 --> 02:16.080]  Can we just finally like,
[02:16.080 --> 02:17.600]  hopefully get rid of that this fall?
[02:17.600 --> 02:18.440]  I hope so.
[02:18.440 --> 02:20.520]  I don't know anything about it.
[02:20.520 --> 02:21.360]  I hope so though.
[02:21.360 --> 02:24.480]  I actually, there's, to me,
[02:24.480 --> 02:27.240]  the naming of the entire MacBook line is,
[02:27.240 --> 02:29.000]  it sounds superficial.
[02:29.000 --> 02:31.640]  And like, for example, it is superficial,
[02:31.640 --> 02:35.040]  the whole like, should we call it iPhone X or iPhone X?
[02:35.040 --> 02:36.760]  Should they have even called it that
[02:36.760 --> 02:38.720]  because there wasn't, at least as yet,
[02:38.720 --> 02:40.520]  there is no iPhone 9?
[02:40.520 --> 02:41.360]  Does it make it?
[02:41.360 --> 02:42.200]  That's superficial.
[02:42.200 --> 02:46.960]  It doesn't really sow confusion, in my opinion.
[02:46.960 --> 02:50.760]  I think the MacBook lineup naming sows confusion.
[02:50.760 --> 02:51.720]  I've mentioned this before,
[02:51.720 --> 02:55.320]  but it's madness that they continue to sell the MacBook Air
[02:55.320 --> 02:58.560]  with the name that implies that it is thinner and lighter
[02:58.560 --> 03:01.440]  when it is way thicker and way heavier
[03:01.440 --> 03:02.880]  than the just plain MacBook.
[03:02.880 --> 03:04.680]  It makes absolutely no sense.
[03:04.680 --> 03:08.000]  And I guess that the logic behind it
[03:08.000 --> 03:10.560]  is they want to drop the name Air.
[03:10.560 --> 03:13.000]  And they've successfully done that on the iPads
[03:13.000 --> 03:14.960]  because they iterate faster.
[03:14.960 --> 03:16.360]  So there's no more iPad Air.
[03:16.360 --> 03:18.680]  There's just plain iPad and then there's iPad Pro.
[03:18.680 --> 03:22.760]  So the iPad has a perfectly logical naming structure,
[03:22.760 --> 03:24.000]  in my opinion.
[03:24.000 --> 03:27.800]  Just plain iPad, it's cheaper, has fewer features.
[03:27.800 --> 03:31.640]  iPad Pro, it's more expensive and has more features
[03:31.640 --> 03:34.000]  like support for the pencil and stuff like that.
[03:35.760 --> 03:38.240]  The Air thing and the just plain MacBook thing,
[03:38.240 --> 03:39.800]  I mean, I don't think they're gonna change the name
[03:39.800 --> 03:43.560]  of the just plain MacBook, which still makes me,
[03:43.560 --> 03:44.520]  that's how I always write it.
[03:44.520 --> 03:45.720]  I write just plain MacBook.
[03:45.720 --> 03:48.240]  I know on your show, it's the MacBook One.
[03:48.240 --> 03:49.800]  Well, even then, I don't know if people recognize that,
[03:49.800 --> 03:52.240]  so I'll usually just say the 12-inch MacBook.
[03:52.240 --> 03:54.920]  But even that, that was a weird name
[03:54.920 --> 03:57.280]  to give it the name MacBook without anything else
[03:57.280 --> 04:00.720]  because that suggests that it's the bottom-of-the-line model
[04:00.720 --> 04:02.000]  and while that's true in performance,
[04:02.000 --> 04:03.960]  that's not true in specs otherwise,
[04:03.960 --> 04:07.240]  or in battery, or sorry, in price.
[04:07.240 --> 04:09.840]  It is not, it is far from the cheapest one.
[04:09.840 --> 04:11.240]  The cheapest one is the MacBook Air
[04:11.240 --> 04:13.280]  and that seemed to be for legacy reasons
[04:13.280 --> 04:17.600]  when the 12-inch MacBook was released in 2015.
[04:17.600 --> 04:19.200]  But that's been, it's been a while now
[04:19.200 --> 04:22.160]  that we've still, it's like, it would be one thing
[04:22.160 --> 04:24.600]  if this was like a problem for like one year
[04:24.600 --> 04:26.280]  or six months, like while they're between cycles,
[04:26.280 --> 04:29.520]  but we've had for three years now this confusion
[04:29.520 --> 04:34.080]  of the MacBook is not the lowest end or cheapest MacBook.
[04:34.080 --> 04:38.480]  The MacBook Pro includes some pretty different capabilities
[04:38.480 --> 04:41.920]  between its different models and the MacBook Air
[04:41.920 --> 04:44.280]  is not the thinnest and lightest one,
[04:44.280 --> 04:45.320]  but it is the lowest end.
[04:45.320 --> 04:47.680]  Like, I don't know, I just, please Apple,
[04:47.680 --> 04:50.560]  fix this naming scheme this fall with whatever you're doing.
[04:50.560 --> 04:54.680]  Yeah, so here's, let's see what Germin said back in March.
[04:54.680 --> 04:57.240]  Something about a lower-priced MacBook.
[04:57.240 --> 04:58.640]  I don't think they're gonna call it an Air.
[04:58.640 --> 05:01.280]  I don't think, I'd be very, very surprised
[05:01.280 --> 05:03.280]  if they update the Air as we know it,
[05:03.280 --> 05:05.560]  like in just, you know, the thing that everybody wants,
[05:05.560 --> 05:08.720]  the, oh God, why can't you just put a retina display
[05:08.720 --> 05:10.800]  in the MacBook Air and don't change anything else
[05:10.800 --> 05:12.320]  and I'll just buy that.
[05:12.320 --> 05:13.880]  And I know that there are people who would,
[05:13.880 --> 05:16.720]  that would make happy, or at least they certainly
[05:16.720 --> 05:18.280]  would have within the last two years.
[05:18.280 --> 05:20.060]  I don't know at this point if that still
[05:20.060 --> 05:23.960]  would make people happy, but that's not gonna happen.
[05:23.960 --> 05:25.760]  Like, I would love if they just,
[05:25.760 --> 05:29.000]  if their low-end computer was still basically
[05:29.000 --> 05:30.880]  the MacBook Air looking thing,
[05:30.880 --> 05:33.400]  but with the retina screen and with the Thunderbolt port
[05:33.400 --> 05:36.520]  replaced by a single USB 3 Thunderbolt 3 port.
[05:36.520 --> 05:39.600]  Like, that would be fine, but they're not gonna make it.
[05:39.600 --> 05:41.720]  There's no way they're gonna make it, but it's funny.
[05:41.720 --> 05:45.160]  Like, it is kind of sad that here we are talking about
[05:45.160 --> 05:48.760]  how like, you know, a lot of people would be very happy
[05:48.760 --> 05:51.880]  if they just made this thing, but Apple won't do that.
[05:51.880 --> 05:53.440]  Apple's not gonna do what their customers
[05:53.440 --> 05:55.340]  actually are asking for.
[05:55.340 --> 05:56.440]  And in some cases that works.
[05:56.440 --> 05:58.160]  Like, in some cases, you know, they do something better
[05:58.160 --> 05:59.600]  that we actually like better,
[05:59.600 --> 06:00.920]  and that's usually how it plays out.
[06:00.920 --> 06:03.120]  But in this case, I don't, like,
[06:03.120 --> 06:04.320]  I think what they're actually going to do
[06:04.320 --> 06:09.320]  is just make a de-specced, lower-priced MacBook escape
[06:09.320 --> 06:11.640]  and call that the new MacBook Air or whatever.
[06:11.640 --> 06:12.960]  Like, make that the replacement for it.
[06:12.960 --> 06:16.080]  Just like, take this machine that they positioned
[06:16.080 --> 06:18.200]  when it was released, they positioned it as
[06:18.200 --> 06:20.320]  this is the replacement for the MacBook Air.
[06:20.320 --> 06:23.040]  But then, of course, it was too limited and too expensive.
[06:23.040 --> 06:24.840]  I think they're just gonna try to address that.
[06:24.840 --> 06:26.200]  They're not gonna make it less limited.
[06:26.200 --> 06:27.800]  They're not gonna, like, add ports back to it or anything.
[06:27.800 --> 06:30.400]  But they will try to make a version of it
[06:30.400 --> 06:31.520]  that is less expensive
[06:31.520 --> 06:33.680]  without sacrificing their massive margins.
[06:33.680 --> 06:38.680]  Yeah, I don't know, it's such a popular product.
[06:39.000 --> 06:42.680]  It is clearly, if you have subscribed
[06:42.680 --> 06:44.080]  to any belief whatsoever
[06:44.080 --> 06:46.440]  that Apple really still is serious about
[06:46.440 --> 06:49.760]  and cares about the Macintosh as a whole,
[06:49.760 --> 06:54.560]  the MacBook lineup from lowest to highest end
[06:54.560 --> 06:56.360]  is entirely, it's their bread and butter.
[06:56.360 --> 06:58.440]  And as much, you know, the iMac Pro,
[06:58.440 --> 07:01.160]  which I have yours right in front of me,
[07:01.160 --> 07:02.480]  it's a great computer,
[07:02.480 --> 07:06.880]  shows their dedication to the niche Pro market.
[07:06.880 --> 07:09.480]  You know, they've promised and talked about in advance,
[07:09.480 --> 07:13.000]  which is unprecedented, an all new Mac Pro,
[07:13.000 --> 07:15.240]  which is an even smaller niche,
[07:16.400 --> 07:19.000]  you know, supposedly coming,
[07:19.000 --> 07:21.920]  a 2019 thing, quote, unquote, a 2019 thing.
[07:21.920 --> 07:22.840]  So next December.
[07:22.840 --> 07:24.360]  Right, I don't think so.
[07:24.360 --> 07:25.680]  I think it'll be early next year.
[07:25.680 --> 07:26.520]  I hope so.
[07:29.880 --> 07:31.760]  And they're still popular, right?
[07:31.760 --> 07:35.320]  I mean, they report how many Macs are sold every quarter.
[07:35.320 --> 07:39.520]  It is completely safe.
[07:39.520 --> 07:42.160]  It's guaranteed to assume that most of them
[07:42.160 --> 07:44.200]  have the name MacBook in them somewhere.
[07:46.760 --> 07:50.840]  But the lineup is a mess naming-wise and spec-wise.
[07:50.840 --> 07:52.840]  You know, like the fact that the most popular one
[07:52.840 --> 07:55.120]  by far has to be still the MacBook Air
[07:55.120 --> 07:57.600]  simply because of price and they're selling,
[07:57.600 --> 07:59.440]  I think the last time you were on my show,
[07:59.440 --> 08:00.960]  we were talking about the madness
[08:00.960 --> 08:04.280]  that they're selling a non-retina display,
[08:04.280 --> 08:05.880]  let alone a non-retina display
[08:05.880 --> 08:07.640]  in their most popular product.
[08:07.640 --> 08:10.000]  Makes some degree of sense in the common sense way
[08:10.000 --> 08:11.880]  just that of course the lowest price one
[08:11.880 --> 08:13.640]  is the one least likely to have a retina display
[08:13.640 --> 08:16.480]  because a retina display is more expensive, obviously,
[08:16.480 --> 08:18.000]  than whatever you, you know,
[08:18.000 --> 08:19.800]  the crummy display in the MacBook Air.
[08:19.800 --> 08:21.760]  But it's just preposterous that they're,
[08:21.760 --> 08:26.200]  you know, here we are in 2018 and it's late July
[08:26.200 --> 08:27.720]  and people are, you know,
[08:27.720 --> 08:30.480]  buying the computers for their kids going to college
[08:30.480 --> 08:32.160]  and surely the most popular one
[08:32.160 --> 08:33.280]  they're sending the kids off to
[08:33.280 --> 08:34.880]  if they're getting a brand new computer
[08:34.880 --> 08:38.000]  is a, what, two or three year old MacBook Air?
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.480]  At least, I think three or four at this point.
[08:40.480 --> 08:42.240]  And you know, it actually,
[08:42.240 --> 08:44.200]  it's not that these people are like being,
[08:44.200 --> 08:46.440]  you know, dumb or cheap.
[08:46.440 --> 08:48.480]  The MacBook Air is still actually pretty compelling
[08:48.480 --> 08:49.920]  if you can just overlook that it's,
[08:49.920 --> 08:51.440]  you know, that the guts are a little bit old
[08:51.440 --> 08:52.800]  and that it has a non-retina screen.
[08:52.800 --> 08:54.320]  But if you can overlook those two things,
[08:54.320 --> 08:55.960]  which a lot of people do,
[08:55.960 --> 08:57.760]  it's still a really compelling computer.
[08:57.760 --> 08:59.760]  It's, the MacBook Air is awesome.
[08:59.760 --> 09:01.200]  Like when that generation,
[09:01.200 --> 09:02.680]  this is like the second body style
[09:02.680 --> 09:05.280]  of the MacBook Air came out in 2010,
[09:05.280 --> 09:08.600]  it was, or 2009, it was amazing.
[09:08.600 --> 09:10.080]  Like remember like even back then,
[09:10.080 --> 09:11.960]  it felt like you were getting away with something.
[09:11.960 --> 09:12.800]  Because it was like,
[09:12.800 --> 09:13.880]  you can look at all the other MacBooks
[09:13.880 --> 09:14.720]  in the lineup at the time,
[09:14.720 --> 09:15.560]  all the MacBook Pros and you're like,
[09:15.560 --> 09:16.720]  you know, actually,
[09:16.720 --> 09:19.480]  this MacBook Air gives me like 80% of what I need
[09:19.480 --> 09:22.560]  in a much nicer and more attractive
[09:22.560 --> 09:24.280]  and easier to carry package.
[09:24.280 --> 09:26.160]  And it remained that way from that generation.
[09:26.160 --> 09:27.400]  Like, you know, because SSDs basically
[09:27.400 --> 09:28.760]  gave it the performance it needed.
[09:28.760 --> 09:32.640]  And it remained that way really until like two years ago,
[09:32.640 --> 09:34.360]  where the MacBook Air was pretty much like
[09:34.360 --> 09:37.080]  the one most people should get most of the time.
[09:37.080 --> 09:39.480]  And it happened to also be one of the,
[09:39.480 --> 09:42.280]  if not the least expensive model most of that time.
[09:42.280 --> 09:44.040]  So it did kind of feel like we were getting away
[09:44.040 --> 09:45.280]  with something all this time.
[09:45.280 --> 09:47.400]  And maybe now Apple's like correcting that in some way.
[09:47.400 --> 09:48.360]  But I don't know,
[09:48.360 --> 09:50.920]  it's the low end of the lineup is still such a mess.
[09:52.280 --> 09:54.360]  Here's, I'm gonna read a little bit
[09:54.360 --> 09:56.920]  from Germin's report from March,
[09:56.920 --> 10:00.120]  which came out before that education event in Chicago.
[10:01.520 --> 10:04.680]  A new cheaper, this is quoting Mark Germin at Bloomberg.
[10:04.680 --> 10:08.560]  A new cheaper MacBook lineup laptop is in the works
[10:08.560 --> 10:11.600]  and likely replace the MacBook Air
[10:11.600 --> 10:14.760]  at a price less than $1,000.
[10:14.760 --> 10:17.960]  So probably 999.
[10:17.960 --> 10:18.800]  Yeah, right.
[10:18.800 --> 10:22.280]  But it probably won't be ready in time for next week.
[10:22.280 --> 10:23.760]  The people said.
[10:23.760 --> 10:24.600]  This was in March.
[10:24.600 --> 10:26.400]  Yeah, this was in March.
[10:26.400 --> 10:27.240]  Well, he was right.
[10:27.240 --> 10:28.560]  It probably wasn't.
[10:28.560 --> 10:33.560]  Like, I just love, I love that because,
[10:36.800 --> 10:39.080]  and again, I'm not saying that he's wrong.
[10:39.080 --> 10:43.600]  I'm not saying that his sources were there,
[10:43.600 --> 10:46.320]  like you just said, technically they were right.
[10:46.320 --> 10:48.560]  But I love that his sources were far enough away
[10:48.560 --> 10:49.440]  that they could only say
[10:49.440 --> 10:51.520]  it probably wasn't going to be coming in March
[10:51.520 --> 10:53.320]  and here we are in July and it still hasn't come out.
[10:53.320 --> 10:55.400]  Yeah, my secret sources say that the Mac Pro
[10:55.400 --> 10:57.760]  is probably not coming out next week either.
[10:57.760 --> 11:02.760]  Yeah, as much as iPhone stuff leaks in advance
[11:04.880 --> 11:08.960]  just because of the insane interest in it
[11:08.960 --> 11:13.640]  and the insane scale,
[11:13.640 --> 11:15.880]  how many of these things they have to have
[11:15.880 --> 11:18.280]  ready to go on opening weekend.
[11:19.640 --> 11:24.040]  And the Mac operates at an entire order of magnitude lower,
[11:24.040 --> 11:28.560]  maybe even more, it does seem like Apple
[11:28.560 --> 11:33.560]  is able to keep Mac hardware stuff under wraps from leakers.
[11:33.760 --> 11:36.080]  Oh yeah, remember, so right now,
[11:36.080 --> 11:38.960]  we're right after the release of the 2018 MacBook Pros.
[11:38.960 --> 11:41.440]  They came out, what, about two weeks ago?
[11:41.440 --> 11:43.120]  A few days before they came out,
[11:43.120 --> 11:45.480]  there was this big report from Ming-Chi Kuo
[11:45.480 --> 11:47.120]  about how Apple's going to refresh
[11:47.120 --> 11:48.960]  basically all the Macs this fall.
[11:48.960 --> 11:52.520]  And on that report, he didn't mention this at all,
[11:52.520 --> 11:54.320]  even though it was going to happen literally
[11:54.320 --> 11:57.200]  like three days after this report.
[11:57.200 --> 11:59.460]  And all he said about the touch bar models
[11:59.460 --> 12:02.400]  was that they will be updated this fall.
[12:02.400 --> 12:04.280]  He had no other information about it.
[12:04.280 --> 12:07.000]  So clearly, here this was, this update that was happening
[12:07.000 --> 12:09.920]  right under his nose, right at that time,
[12:09.920 --> 12:10.900]  and he didn't even know.
[12:10.900 --> 12:12.360]  And he's very well sourced
[12:12.360 --> 12:13.520]  and usually knows about such things.
[12:13.520 --> 12:16.920]  So clearly, the secrecy is way more effective
[12:16.920 --> 12:20.040]  on the Mac side than on the iOS side.
[12:20.040 --> 12:23.000]  Yeah, so I think it's reasonable,
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.440]  even though there's near radio silence on any details
[12:26.440 --> 12:29.200]  of what new MacBooks of various price points
[12:29.200 --> 12:31.120]  might be released this fall,
[12:31.120 --> 12:32.960]  I think it's very reasonable for us,
[12:32.960 --> 12:35.640]  as interested people in the market,
[12:35.640 --> 12:40.000]  to be optimistic that in September or October,
[12:40.000 --> 12:41.520]  Apple will have a lot to show us
[12:41.520 --> 12:43.400]  and say about the entire lineup,
[12:43.400 --> 12:47.120]  including some kind of modern update
[12:47.120 --> 12:50.360]  to their entry-level machine.
[12:50.360 --> 12:52.720]  I sure hope so, and I think they will.
[12:52.720 --> 12:53.620]  I think what they're showing us,
[12:53.620 --> 12:54.640]  I've said this on ATP before,
[12:54.640 --> 12:57.320]  it does seem like we're in an upswing for the Mac.
[12:57.320 --> 13:00.880]  We're in a good time where they had,
[13:00.880 --> 13:02.000]  they're talking about the Mac Pro
[13:02.000 --> 13:03.680]  and the Pro Display coming up soon.
[13:03.680 --> 13:06.480]  I hope those are awesome, and they probably will be.
[13:06.480 --> 13:08.920]  The iMac Pro is awesome.
[13:08.920 --> 13:11.440]  The 2018 MacBook Pros,
[13:11.440 --> 13:13.000]  I still have a lot of problems with them
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.120]  because there's still this body generation,
[13:15.120 --> 13:16.720]  the touch bar, all the stuff I don't like,
[13:16.720 --> 13:17.880]  the keyboard, I still don't like,
[13:17.880 --> 13:19.960]  but I give them credit,
[13:19.960 --> 13:23.040]  they do seem to be moving in the right direction
[13:23.040 --> 13:24.200]  in the last couple of years.
[13:24.200 --> 13:27.040]  I think they have course-corrected on the Mac,
[13:27.040 --> 13:28.160]  and the software side, too,
[13:28.160 --> 13:32.000]  is there's tons of motion there with things like Marzipan.
[13:32.000 --> 13:33.240]  Those are major efforts,
[13:33.240 --> 13:34.760]  and those are gonna be majorly
[13:34.760 --> 13:36.240]  pushing the platform forward,
[13:36.240 --> 13:38.880]  and I cannot wait for that kind of stuff.
[13:38.880 --> 13:41.160]  So obviously, you look at,
[13:41.160 --> 13:43.120]  on the hardware side, you look at things like the T2 chip
[13:43.120 --> 13:47.240]  and how this is this pretty advanced controller
[13:47.240 --> 13:48.920]  that they have in there that's doing all sorts of stuff
[13:48.920 --> 13:50.480]  that they didn't need to do that.
[13:50.480 --> 13:53.120]  So I do think they're on the right path now,
[13:53.120 --> 13:54.720]  but we still need to see,
[13:54.720 --> 13:55.960]  what does that mean on the laptops?
[13:55.960 --> 13:57.800]  We still have no idea.
[13:57.800 --> 13:59.120]  And maybe this fall,
[13:59.120 --> 14:02.400]  maybe whatever the new, cheaper one is,
[14:02.400 --> 14:03.960]  maybe I'm totally wrong.
[14:03.960 --> 14:05.440]  My theory that I set a few minutes ago
[14:05.440 --> 14:07.400]  is basically that they're gonna half-ass it,
[14:07.400 --> 14:09.800]  that they're gonna cut out some specs
[14:09.800 --> 14:11.160]  from the MacBook escape as it is now
[14:11.160 --> 14:13.720]  to make a new 999 configuration.
[14:13.720 --> 14:15.840]  Like maybe, I don't know, give it a 128 gig disk
[14:15.840 --> 14:17.400]  or something like,
[14:17.400 --> 14:19.680]  basically skimp out as much as possible on everything
[14:19.680 --> 14:21.400]  to get that price down
[14:21.400 --> 14:24.120]  with still a margin that Apple will accept.
[14:24.120 --> 14:26.800]  But maybe I'm wrong, and maybe what they're gonna do
[14:26.800 --> 14:29.160]  is do what the original MacBook Air did,
[14:29.160 --> 14:31.120]  which is debut a new body style.
[14:31.120 --> 14:33.480]  Like, without coming out and saying so,
[14:33.480 --> 14:36.640]  maybe they're actually doing an original design
[14:36.640 --> 14:38.440]  for this new, cheap laptop,
[14:38.440 --> 14:41.120]  and maybe that design will be a preview
[14:41.120 --> 14:44.000]  of what's to come for the rest of the lineup.
[14:44.000 --> 14:45.800]  Yeah, and I always took it as a hint
[14:45.800 --> 14:48.360]  when they came out with the Just Plain MacBook,
[14:48.360 --> 14:50.480]  and it was just called Just Plain MacBook,
[14:50.480 --> 14:52.400]  and I forget what the starting price was originally,
[14:52.400 --> 14:53.240]  but I think it was like.
[14:53.240 --> 14:54.960]  1600 or something, 15, 14?
[14:54.960 --> 14:57.080]  I think there might have been like a 1400 config,
[14:57.080 --> 14:58.240]  but it was bad.
[14:58.240 --> 15:02.560]  You kind of, you very quickly got over 1500 configuring one.
[15:02.560 --> 15:04.640]  I mean, to be fair, that first generation were all bad.
[15:04.640 --> 15:05.480]  Right.
[15:05.480 --> 15:08.320]  It's just, I think that last year it barely became usable.
[15:08.320 --> 15:13.080]  Right, because that original Atom processor was really.
[15:13.080 --> 15:15.480]  Yeah, and the SSD was slow and everything like that.
[15:15.480 --> 15:18.320]  The 2017 model really improved a lot.
[15:18.320 --> 15:20.140]  But I always thought that the name
[15:20.140 --> 15:22.700]  was a very strong signal that it would become
[15:22.700 --> 15:24.040]  the new entry level model,
[15:24.040 --> 15:26.960]  because it just makes product marketing sense
[15:26.960 --> 15:31.000]  that the one without any modifier, Just Plain MacBook,
[15:31.000 --> 15:32.040]  would be the entry level,
[15:32.040 --> 15:34.260]  but it couldn't be when it debuted,
[15:34.260 --> 15:37.980]  because they made it so crazy thin and light
[15:37.980 --> 15:42.080]  that they had to use expensive components,
[15:42.080 --> 15:44.040]  even though they were slow and et cetera.
[15:44.040 --> 15:46.460]  It's just the only way to make it so insanely thin
[15:46.460 --> 15:48.260]  compared to everything before it.
[15:48.260 --> 15:49.100]  I don't know.
[15:49.100 --> 15:51.800]  That's possible, but I think maybe that was their goal.
[15:51.800 --> 15:52.640]  I don't know, but I don't think
[15:52.640 --> 15:54.760]  that's ever going to really be successful.
[15:54.760 --> 15:57.120]  I don't see that product, the 12 inch with the one port,
[15:57.120 --> 15:59.240]  I don't see that being the one
[15:59.240 --> 16:01.780]  that becomes the new entry level mass market thing,
[16:01.780 --> 16:03.720]  because there are so many trade-offs.
[16:03.720 --> 16:06.280]  Like, when the MacBook Air first came out,
[16:06.280 --> 16:09.840]  it was $1600, I think, or $1700 for its base,
[16:09.840 --> 16:11.840]  and it was very limited in the first one
[16:11.840 --> 16:13.580]  before the nice 2010 revision.
[16:14.840 --> 16:17.400]  And it couldn't be the bottom of the line,
[16:17.400 --> 16:19.360]  because people buying the bottom of the line
[16:19.360 --> 16:20.200]  still have needs.
[16:20.200 --> 16:23.200]  They're buying to hit a price point often,
[16:23.200 --> 16:26.760]  but they still have practicality needs to worry about.
[16:26.760 --> 16:30.200]  So with the MacBook Air originally,
[16:30.200 --> 16:32.140]  that couldn't serve that purpose even if it were cheaper,
[16:32.140 --> 16:34.240]  because it didn't have things like a DVD drive
[16:34.240 --> 16:35.700]  that everyone needed, right?
[16:35.700 --> 16:38.580]  And with the 12 inch MacBook today,
[16:39.680 --> 16:41.600]  you could make an argument that like,
[16:41.600 --> 16:43.120]  well, it gives up all this stuff,
[16:43.120 --> 16:44.360]  it gives up a lot of performance
[16:44.360 --> 16:45.720]  compared to the 15 watt chips
[16:45.720 --> 16:47.780]  that's there in the MacBook Air and the MacBook Escape.
[16:47.780 --> 16:50.120]  It gives up all these ports, you know,
[16:50.120 --> 16:51.760]  even if you set aside things like the keyboard
[16:51.760 --> 16:53.200]  that are controversial.
[16:53.200 --> 16:57.000]  It gives up so much, but I don't see people ever saying,
[16:57.000 --> 16:58.360]  you know what, I only need one port
[16:58.360 --> 16:59.760]  for my entry level laptop.
[16:59.760 --> 17:01.640]  Like, some people who are, you know,
[17:01.640 --> 17:03.680]  some people can choose that and say,
[17:03.680 --> 17:05.040]  you know, for my travel laptop or whatever,
[17:05.040 --> 17:06.320]  I'm fine with that.
[17:06.320 --> 17:08.440]  But people who are buying the entry level model
[17:08.440 --> 17:09.840]  are the mass market.
[17:09.840 --> 17:11.740]  And they, like, one of the reasons
[17:11.740 --> 17:13.400]  the MacBook Air keeps selling so well
[17:13.400 --> 17:15.180]  is that compared to the MacBook,
[17:15.180 --> 17:17.320]  it does have a whole bunch more ports and everything,
[17:17.320 --> 17:18.940]  and it is more versatile and everything.
[17:18.940 --> 17:20.420]  Before that, before the MacBook Air
[17:20.420 --> 17:22.720]  became the role in the lineup,
[17:22.720 --> 17:27.720]  it was that MD101, the 13 inch non-retina MacBook Pro,
[17:27.840 --> 17:29.680]  that still had the DVD drive.
[17:29.680 --> 17:31.080]  Remember, they only stopped selling that like, what,
[17:31.080 --> 17:31.920]  a year or two ago?
[17:31.920 --> 17:34.320]  It was very recent, that like 2012 model
[17:34.320 --> 17:35.160]  or something like that.
[17:35.160 --> 17:36.720]  And you know, before the Air,
[17:36.720 --> 17:39.800]  that was a suspiciously large seller
[17:39.800 --> 17:41.160]  for the exact same reason,
[17:41.160 --> 17:44.500]  that it was very inexpensive,
[17:44.500 --> 17:47.880]  it was also inexpensive to spec up
[17:47.880 --> 17:50.740]  because it had a spinning disk and RAM slots,
[17:50.740 --> 17:52.060]  so you could like buy third party stuff
[17:52.060 --> 17:53.080]  or even the stuff from Apple,
[17:53.080 --> 17:55.060]  you could get a lot of storage for not that much money.
[17:55.060 --> 17:57.560]  And it had the optical drive and had all the ports.
[17:57.560 --> 17:59.200]  And so people who didn't care about retina,
[17:59.200 --> 18:00.740]  who didn't care about newness
[18:00.740 --> 18:02.880]  and who just wanted something very versatile
[18:02.880 --> 18:04.360]  for like a thousand bucks or less,
[18:04.360 --> 18:06.320]  they had that option with the 101.
[18:06.320 --> 18:09.620]  Now, optical drives are out of favor enough
[18:09.620 --> 18:11.000]  that people don't need that anymore,
[18:11.000 --> 18:12.720]  so they went to the MacBook Air.
[18:12.720 --> 18:16.880]  But I don't see like 90% of your ports going away
[18:16.880 --> 18:18.760]  being a thing that's gonna be so easily moved
[18:18.760 --> 18:21.520]  into people's minds for that bottom of the line laptop.
[18:21.520 --> 18:22.340]  Yeah.
[18:24.320 --> 18:26.800]  Yeah, so what do we think Apple should do?
[18:26.800 --> 18:29.560]  Like if you and I had been secretly recruited
[18:29.560 --> 18:33.660]  to Apple's MacBook development team 18 months ago
[18:33.660 --> 18:35.760]  so that we could have a lineup
[18:35.760 --> 18:38.020]  for the fall of 2018 ready to go.
[18:38.920 --> 18:39.760]  I kind of,
[18:39.760 --> 18:41.900]  Bob, come on, man.
[18:43.000 --> 18:43.840]  I kind of,
[18:43.840 --> 18:44.760]  We have a guest in the room.
[18:44.760 --> 18:46.920]  I kind of think we're on a similar page
[18:46.920 --> 18:50.440]  where the default machine should,
[18:50.440 --> 18:52.440]  at a 9.99 or even ideally,
[18:52.440 --> 18:55.040]  if they could get back to 8.99 like they did
[18:55.040 --> 18:59.280]  when they, when they,
[19:00.280 --> 19:01.120]  thank you,
[19:01.120 --> 19:05.760]  when they had the 11-inch Air for 8.99 for a while.
[19:05.760 --> 19:07.900]  And I think the reason they felt like they could do that,
[19:07.900 --> 19:10.340]  because that's a rare thing for any company to do,
[19:10.340 --> 19:13.640]  is to raise the minimum price as significantly.
[19:13.640 --> 19:14.820]  Like it used to be you could walk in
[19:14.820 --> 19:17.000]  and get an 8.99 MacBook, the 11-inch,
[19:17.000 --> 19:18.440]  and then they did away with it,
[19:18.440 --> 19:23.000]  and the cheapest jumped $100 to 9.99.
[19:23.000 --> 19:24.580]  And I feel like the reason they could do that
[19:24.580 --> 19:26.360]  was that the 11-inch MacBook Air,
[19:26.360 --> 19:27.180]  even though it was cheaper,
[19:27.180 --> 19:29.240]  was always sort of a niche product.
[19:29.240 --> 19:30.080]  Like,
[19:30.080 --> 19:30.900]  Yeah, it was so small.
[19:30.900 --> 19:32.480]  It was only for people who really,
[19:32.480 --> 19:34.800]  and I had mine for years and truly loved it
[19:34.800 --> 19:36.960]  because it was always a secondary machine for me.
[19:36.960 --> 19:39.240]  And I truly love the size and portability of it.
[19:39.240 --> 19:41.920]  It's really one of my favorite machines I've ever owned.
[19:41.920 --> 19:43.720]  But I think people who,
[19:43.720 --> 19:47.800]  the typical person who's buying a laptop to be their PC,
[19:47.800 --> 19:48.720]  that's it.
[19:48.720 --> 19:51.720]  This is the thing that's a real computer for them,
[19:51.720 --> 19:54.180]  don't want to sacrifice the screen real estate
[19:54.180 --> 19:56.080]  and have a slightly smaller keyboard, et cetera.
[19:56.080 --> 19:59.000]  Yeah, the 13-inch Air was always like the mass market one.
[19:59.000 --> 20:00.820]  So I feel like the default machine
[20:00.820 --> 20:03.400]  should be bigger than the 12-inch MacBook.
[20:03.400 --> 20:05.560]  Should probably have a 13-inch screen.
[20:05.560 --> 20:07.300]  It should have a few more ports,
[20:07.300 --> 20:10.560]  but they're not gonna include USB-A ports,
[20:10.560 --> 20:12.520]  even though I feel like they should.
[20:12.520 --> 20:14.700]  I mean, we should almost do a whole segment
[20:14.700 --> 20:17.200]  on the failure of the USB-C market.
[20:18.160 --> 20:19.760]  I do one on ATP almost every week.
[20:19.760 --> 20:20.600]  I know.
[20:20.600 --> 20:21.420]  I know.
[20:21.420 --> 20:24.740]  But I think it really shows with people's,
[20:24.740 --> 20:26.060]  as the clamor,
[20:26.060 --> 20:28.300]  we're recording this after the software update
[20:28.300 --> 20:32.940]  that fixed the throttling gate with the Core i9.
[20:32.940 --> 20:33.780]  So the people-
[20:33.780 --> 20:35.340]  Aren't you lucky that you missed that on the show?
[20:35.340 --> 20:36.600]  Like you didn't have like,
[20:36.600 --> 20:38.420]  if you had an episode like last week,
[20:38.420 --> 20:40.540]  you would have had to like do what we did on ATP
[20:40.540 --> 20:42.220]  with like, look at all these YouTube things
[20:42.220 --> 20:44.040]  and Reddit things and try to figure out what's going on
[20:44.040 --> 20:45.300]  and try to speculate.
[20:45.300 --> 20:47.660]  I mean, we were wrong about like half of what we said.
[20:47.660 --> 20:49.420]  Well, I skipped it on During Fireball.
[20:49.420 --> 20:50.260]  I just didn't,
[20:50.260 --> 20:51.740]  I don't even think I linked to it.
[20:51.740 --> 20:54.780]  And I got a lot of people asking,
[20:54.780 --> 20:56.260]  most of the feedback I got was just,
[20:56.260 --> 20:57.500]  what do you think about this?
[20:57.500 --> 21:00.140]  And I answered by email to some people,
[21:01.080 --> 21:02.660]  but I just didn't link to it.
[21:02.660 --> 21:04.400]  And then of course the accusations
[21:04.400 --> 21:05.540]  that I wasn't linking to it,
[21:05.540 --> 21:06.900]  cause I'm in the bag for Apple
[21:06.900 --> 21:11.260]  and I'm covering up this outrageous scandal.
[21:11.260 --> 21:12.400]  My thought was,
[21:14.740 --> 21:17.740]  we're sort of segueing into the specific thing with this,
[21:17.740 --> 21:19.340]  but my thought on that whole thing was,
[21:19.340 --> 21:20.700]  there's just not enough evidence yet.
[21:20.700 --> 21:23.220]  It just sounds to me like it's probably a bug
[21:23.220 --> 21:24.340]  and we'll know soon enough
[21:24.340 --> 21:25.780]  whether it's a bug that can be fixed
[21:25.780 --> 21:28.720]  or a genuine serious engineering flaw.
[21:28.720 --> 21:31.780]  And I'll decline to comment until there's more evidence
[21:31.780 --> 21:36.660]  than one YouTube guy using one app, Premiere Pro,
[21:36.660 --> 21:39.820]  which probably, the nature of which
[21:39.820 --> 21:43.200]  is probably not that optimized for Macs
[21:43.200 --> 21:45.300]  and evidence that's come out since
[21:45.300 --> 21:46.660]  has shown that to be true.
[21:46.660 --> 21:47.760]  I mean, Adobe makes that, right?
[21:47.760 --> 21:48.940]  So it's not optimized for anything.
[21:48.940 --> 21:51.780]  No, but I think, going back to your question a minute ago,
[21:51.780 --> 21:53.820]  I think what would Apple need to do
[21:53.820 --> 21:56.020]  to make the new MacBook Air replacement?
[21:56.020 --> 21:58.780]  I think the MacBook Escape can almost be that.
[21:58.780 --> 21:59.980]  It just needs a few changes.
[21:59.980 --> 22:02.400]  And I know we're never getting USB-A back.
[22:02.400 --> 22:04.500]  I'm not even arguing for USB-A anymore.
[22:04.500 --> 22:06.180]  If you can fit one on the side of a laptop,
[22:06.180 --> 22:07.780]  it is really nice for convenience.
[22:07.780 --> 22:09.460]  But I know that's a lost battle,
[22:09.460 --> 22:12.180]  so I'm not even saying they should do that.
[22:12.180 --> 22:14.300]  I do argue for the SD card
[22:14.300 --> 22:16.500]  to be included in the higher end models.
[22:16.500 --> 22:18.280]  I don't necessarily think it needs to be
[22:18.280 --> 22:19.660]  in a MacBook Air replacement.
[22:19.660 --> 22:22.960]  But I think what it does need, which it almost has,
[22:22.960 --> 22:26.580]  is four ports and a lower price.
[22:26.580 --> 22:27.940]  That's about it.
[22:27.940 --> 22:29.440]  That's all it needs.
[22:29.440 --> 22:31.700]  And I know they're probably not gonna give me
[22:31.700 --> 22:32.540]  the four ports.
[22:32.540 --> 22:34.140]  There's probably some limitation with Thunderbolt lanes
[22:34.140 --> 22:36.440]  that are on the 15-watt, or PCI Express lanes
[22:36.440 --> 22:40.220]  available on the 15-watt CPU line from Intel that it uses.
[22:40.220 --> 22:42.900]  Like, it's probably something like that.
[22:42.900 --> 22:45.140]  I still, there's so many problems with USB-C
[22:45.140 --> 22:46.980]  that this is even a problem.
[22:46.980 --> 22:49.020]  Like, USB-A was never limited by Thunderbolt lanes,
[22:49.020 --> 22:50.220]  or by PCI Express lanes,
[22:50.220 --> 22:51.900]  because they didn't build Thunderbolt into every port,
[22:51.900 --> 22:53.700]  because most people don't need that.
[22:53.700 --> 22:57.420]  So here you are wasting one of your ports on power,
[22:57.420 --> 23:00.060]  and wasting another one on charging your iPhone,
[23:00.060 --> 23:01.180]  and you can't have more ports
[23:01.180 --> 23:02.180]  because they need all the bandwidth
[23:02.180 --> 23:04.860]  for the Thunderbolt 3 lanes that you're not using.
[23:04.860 --> 23:06.700]  So that's a weird engineering trade-off
[23:06.700 --> 23:07.540]  they made to begin with.
[23:07.540 --> 23:09.580]  But I think that's all it really needs.
[23:09.580 --> 23:11.140]  And I think that's plausible.
[23:11.140 --> 23:12.880]  The four-port thing is a risk.
[23:12.880 --> 23:14.880]  But just making a version of the escape
[23:14.880 --> 23:17.520]  that has cheaper pricing somehow,
[23:17.520 --> 23:19.740]  you know, somehow with market segmentation
[23:19.740 --> 23:20.820]  that they can do it, I don't know.
[23:20.820 --> 23:25.380]  But the current laptop line, like the new generation,
[23:25.380 --> 23:26.620]  if you exclude the old models
[23:26.620 --> 23:28.060]  they're still selling, like the Air,
[23:28.060 --> 23:31.560]  the new line is so expensive compared to the old ones.
[23:32.940 --> 23:35.460]  That's a problem for them, I think,
[23:35.460 --> 23:36.580]  in the way their products look,
[23:36.580 --> 23:37.960]  the way they're perceived.
[23:37.960 --> 23:40.140]  I mean, they've always been perceived as being expensive,
[23:40.140 --> 23:43.980]  but I think this is getting to the point of being egregious.
[23:43.980 --> 23:45.860]  And it's getting more and more distant
[23:45.860 --> 23:48.980]  from what people expect to pay for such a thing.
[23:48.980 --> 23:51.500]  And then the low-end kind of rotting out here
[23:51.500 --> 23:54.420]  and being neglected for so long is not helping that at all.
[23:54.420 --> 23:57.560]  So they need to make a good low-end play.
[23:57.560 --> 24:00.140]  And you're gonna have people who make
[24:00.140 --> 24:02.700]  like the $200 iPhone argument a bit like,
[24:02.700 --> 24:03.520]  oh, they don't have to do that,
[24:03.520 --> 24:04.360]  they're just serving the market.
[24:04.360 --> 24:06.880]  But like a huge part of Mac market share
[24:06.880 --> 24:08.980]  is those like $1,000 MacBook Airs.
[24:08.980 --> 24:11.020]  And those are getting really long on the two.
[24:11.020 --> 24:12.500]  They have to replace them with something.
[24:12.500 --> 24:15.220]  And it really should be as soon as possible.
[24:15.220 --> 24:19.820]  Yeah, and I think it comes down to naming again,
[24:19.820 --> 24:21.300]  just to go back to where we started,
[24:21.300 --> 24:26.300]  is the MacBook Escape
[24:26.300 --> 24:29.220]  should not be called a MacBook Pro, in my opinion.
[24:29.220 --> 24:30.900]  And it's not.
[24:30.900 --> 24:33.260]  I mean, it is a cut below.
[24:33.260 --> 24:36.940]  Other than the fact that the aluminum frame
[24:36.940 --> 24:40.380]  is exactly the same as the 13-inch MacBook Pros,
[24:40.380 --> 24:45.380]  touch bar versus actual physical function keys aside,
[24:46.400 --> 24:48.640]  and it has the same display.
[24:48.640 --> 24:52.880]  But internally, it's got a lesser CPU,
[24:52.880 --> 24:55.520]  it has lesser graphics, it costs less.
[24:56.960 --> 24:58.240]  It's not a MacBook Pro.
[24:58.240 --> 24:59.520]  It should be called something else.
[24:59.520 --> 25:02.120]  I guess I see why they called it a MacBook Pro,
[25:02.120 --> 25:03.760]  because it does look the same,
[25:03.760 --> 25:05.880]  and it was introduced alongside them.
[25:05.880 --> 25:07.000]  It's also a great computer.
[25:07.000 --> 25:08.400]  Like, I have one for a little while.
[25:08.400 --> 25:09.760]  I love that Escape.
[25:09.760 --> 25:12.200]  The only things I hated about it were
[25:12.200 --> 25:13.600]  that I did have keyboard problems with it.
[25:13.600 --> 25:15.920]  I had a bunch of stuck keys and weird popping and everything.
[25:15.920 --> 25:17.160]  And so I did have keyboard problems with it,
[25:17.160 --> 25:19.880]  and the two ports were really annoying on trips.
[25:19.880 --> 25:22.580]  Like, when I would travel, I'd wanna do travel podcasting
[25:22.580 --> 25:23.720]  or charge stuff on my laptop,
[25:23.720 --> 25:26.000]  and only having two ports was pretty limiting.
[25:26.000 --> 25:27.840]  But other than that, I loved that computer.
[25:27.840 --> 25:29.680]  It was great, and that's why I ordered a 13-inch
[25:29.680 --> 25:31.800]  of the new one, but I ordered the touch bar one,
[25:31.800 --> 25:32.640]  because I wanted the ports.
[25:32.640 --> 25:35.360]  But I think the reason they called it Pro
[25:35.360 --> 25:40.160]  was I think more because it visually resembled
[25:40.160 --> 25:41.400]  the other 13-inch Pro just fine,
[25:41.400 --> 25:43.440]  and also I think because they wanted
[25:43.440 --> 25:45.520]  to help justify the cost increase,
[25:45.520 --> 25:47.340]  because it really was just a MacBook Air,
[25:47.340 --> 25:49.040]  but they increased the cost so much,
[25:49.040 --> 25:51.400]  I felt like that was my guess of why they did it.
[25:51.400 --> 25:54.320]  But ultimately, if I was in charge of this product line,
[25:54.320 --> 25:55.280]  of naming this product line,
[25:55.280 --> 25:56.320]  I wouldn't want any responsibility,
[25:56.320 --> 25:57.460]  because they would fire me immediately.
[25:57.460 --> 25:59.520]  But if I was in charge of naming this product line,
[25:59.520 --> 26:01.560]  and I guess I'd be fired from that too,
[26:01.560 --> 26:03.440]  but I don't think they would call it
[26:03.440 --> 26:05.380]  the MacBook One or the MacBook Escape.
[26:05.380 --> 26:09.680]  But I think I would say the MacBook Air brand
[26:09.680 --> 26:11.440]  is too strong to throw away
[26:11.440 --> 26:13.400]  when this generation stops being sold.
[26:13.400 --> 26:15.840]  I think something should always be called the MacBook Air,
[26:15.840 --> 26:17.800]  because it's such a good name,
[26:17.800 --> 26:20.040]  and it has such brand equity among consumers.
[26:20.040 --> 26:25.040]  So what I would say is rename the 12-inch MacBook MacBook Air
[26:25.480 --> 26:26.600]  with its next generation, and say,
[26:26.600 --> 26:29.740]  this is the new MacBook Air, it's the 12-inch MacBook.
[26:29.740 --> 26:32.380]  Rename the MacBook Escape to simply MacBook.
[26:32.380 --> 26:34.140]  I could see that.
[26:34.140 --> 26:35.300]  I mean, there is some sense to that,
[26:35.300 --> 26:39.740]  especially if they could get a 12-inch MacBook down to 999,
[26:39.740 --> 26:41.580]  which I kind of think it might be their plan.
[26:41.580 --> 26:42.500]  Well, that isn't even what I'm arguing.
[26:42.500 --> 26:44.560]  I'm saying bring the Escape,
[26:44.560 --> 26:46.980]  bring the 13-inch down to that level.
[26:46.980 --> 26:48.460]  Call it the MacBook.
[26:48.460 --> 26:51.360]  And because right now you have this conflation
[26:51.360 --> 26:53.180]  of the lowest end product
[26:53.180 --> 26:56.140]  is also the smallest, thinnest, and lightest.
[26:56.140 --> 26:57.660]  But that requires such trade-offs
[26:57.660 --> 26:59.820]  that a lot of the low-end buyers aren't willing to make
[26:59.820 --> 27:02.060]  that that shouldn't be the lowest end product.
[27:02.060 --> 27:04.220]  It should be, the low-end product should be
[27:04.220 --> 27:06.900]  to hit a price point, not to hit a size.
[27:06.900 --> 27:09.480]  And so that's why the Escape should be the low-end product.
[27:09.480 --> 27:10.940]  It should be called the MacBook.
[27:10.940 --> 27:13.540]  The MacBook Air should be the little 12-inch,
[27:13.540 --> 27:15.740]  super-thin one, and then the MacBook Pro
[27:15.740 --> 27:17.100]  is the higher-priced, higher-powered one.
[27:17.100 --> 27:19.140]  And the 13-inch MacBook Escape,
[27:19.140 --> 27:22.420]  well, all the 13-inch, my current MacBook Pros are,
[27:22.420 --> 27:25.020]  and Apple themselves emphasized this
[27:25.020 --> 27:26.320]  when they introduced them,
[27:27.320 --> 27:30.920]  only two sheets of paper heavier than a MacBook Air.
[27:30.920 --> 27:35.780]  Like, they are technically an ounce heavier
[27:35.780 --> 27:36.620]  or something like that.
[27:36.620 --> 27:37.580]  But that's, I think it's grams.
[27:37.580 --> 27:39.700]  It's like, it's so, it's so small.
[27:39.700 --> 27:42.020]  Right, like you could probably even it up
[27:42.020 --> 27:45.740]  just by getting some sweat and some crumbs
[27:45.740 --> 27:48.660]  on your MacBook Air, and then they'd be the same.
[27:48.660 --> 27:50.220]  The one over the keyboard would still work with the cups.
[27:50.220 --> 27:52.540]  Yeah, just keep the crumbs away from the new one.
[27:54.380 --> 27:56.620]  Yeah, well, we'll keep going on this.
[27:56.620 --> 27:58.540]  Let me take a break and thank our first sponsor.
[27:58.540 --> 27:59.380]  This is gonna be good.
[27:59.380 --> 28:02.620]  I think the sponsors, it's coincidence, sort of,
[28:02.620 --> 28:04.000]  but it's kind of fun.
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.580]  There's, every single one of them is actually in use today.
[28:08.580 --> 28:11.420]  Our first one is Trace Pontas Coffee.
[28:12.460 --> 28:13.740]  I'm drinking it right now.
[28:13.740 --> 28:14.700]  Marco can vouch for it.
[28:14.700 --> 28:17.120]  Now, this is in the Arment household.
[28:17.120 --> 28:18.660]  There is Trace Pontas Coffee.
[28:19.500 --> 28:20.940]  And I didn't order it because you were coming.
[28:20.940 --> 28:23.780]  I ordered it long before I knew you were gonna be here.
[28:23.780 --> 28:25.300]  I ordered it by my own volition.
[28:25.300 --> 28:26.940]  They aren't the sponsor of my show.
[28:26.940 --> 28:28.980]  I ordered it only because they were a sponsor of this show.
[28:28.980 --> 28:30.820]  And we, you know, I've been here a few days
[28:30.820 --> 28:34.100]  and we have been drinking some of Marco's own,
[28:34.100 --> 28:37.500]  Marco roasted coffee, but it was all gone.
[28:38.500 --> 28:40.980]  And the only other coffee in the house.
[28:40.980 --> 28:42.900]  Turns out the groupers drink a lot of coffee.
[28:42.900 --> 28:47.020]  No, one of the groupers drinks a lot of coffee.
[28:48.340 --> 28:49.660]  I am drinking it right now.
[28:49.660 --> 28:54.660]  It comes from a single family farm in Trace Pontas,
[28:54.940 --> 28:57.260]  in the town of Trace Pontas in Brazil,
[28:57.260 --> 28:59.560]  hence the name Trace Pontas.
[28:59.560 --> 29:01.740]  They only have one variety of beans.
[29:01.740 --> 29:03.240]  And it's very simple.
[29:03.240 --> 29:06.500]  They have four roasts, light, medium, dark,
[29:06.500 --> 29:07.660]  and then French roast.
[29:07.660 --> 29:08.480]  What are we drinking?
[29:08.480 --> 29:09.320]  I don't even know.
[29:09.320 --> 29:10.160]  I'm guessing light.
[29:10.160 --> 29:11.380]  No, I think it's medium.
[29:11.380 --> 29:13.580]  It's either medium or like the slightly dark one.
[29:13.580 --> 29:15.460]  Because usually I like my coffee a little dark,
[29:15.460 --> 29:16.300]  but not too dark.
[29:16.300 --> 29:18.380]  So I would have gotten one of those too.
[29:18.380 --> 29:20.260]  I prefer the medium, I think, at home
[29:20.260 --> 29:21.420]  because they've sent me all of them.
[29:21.420 --> 29:24.700]  And I'm just not a French roast person.
[29:24.700 --> 29:26.440]  I find the French roast to be terrible.
[29:26.440 --> 29:28.500]  But people who like French roasts might like it
[29:28.500 --> 29:29.340]  because it's-
[29:29.340 --> 29:30.740]  Spoiler, every French roast is terrible.
[29:30.740 --> 29:33.460]  That's my opinion as well.
[29:33.460 --> 29:34.740]  I'm pretty sure this is the medium.
[29:34.740 --> 29:35.840]  But it's kind of a neat thing
[29:35.840 --> 29:37.140]  where you don't have to select the beans.
[29:37.140 --> 29:38.520]  You just select the roast style,
[29:38.520 --> 29:40.720]  which in a lot of cases, in my opinion,
[29:40.720 --> 29:41.940]  is really the biggest difference.
[29:41.940 --> 29:43.880]  If you're starting with good beans,
[29:43.880 --> 29:46.340]  which is half the battle,
[29:46.340 --> 29:48.540]  but then just get it roasted the way you like it.
[29:48.540 --> 29:49.380]  That's your choice.
[29:49.380 --> 29:51.540]  People always ask me, where do you get good beans?
[29:51.540 --> 29:53.020]  And what it really comes down to
[29:53.020 --> 29:54.660]  is not what brand name is on them or anything.
[29:54.660 --> 29:57.560]  What it really comes down to is how well is it roasted?
[29:57.560 --> 29:59.220]  And they give you the option for that.
[29:59.220 --> 30:01.700]  And how freshly is it roasted?
[30:01.700 --> 30:03.620]  And they solve that problem as well.
[30:03.620 --> 30:06.080]  Right, their coffee is very fresh.
[30:06.080 --> 30:07.740]  That is their main thing.
[30:07.740 --> 30:10.160]  They ship all the stuff out themselves.
[30:10.160 --> 30:11.220]  Marco can vouch for this.
[30:11.220 --> 30:14.020]  I say it every time Trace Ponta sponsors the show.
[30:14.020 --> 30:16.360]  Coffee is a perishable item.
[30:16.360 --> 30:18.940]  This is why it is good to buy whole beans.
[30:18.940 --> 30:21.740]  This is why it's good to get a nice grinder.
[30:21.740 --> 30:25.780]  And this is why it is great to get something
[30:25.780 --> 30:29.380]  like a coffee subscription, which Trace Pontas offers,
[30:29.380 --> 30:33.380]  to just keep fresh beans coming to you at a regular basis.
[30:33.380 --> 30:36.260]  Now it's not like, I don't know,
[30:36.260 --> 30:37.700]  like an avocado or something like that,
[30:37.700 --> 30:38.880]  where it can quickly go bad.
[30:38.880 --> 30:40.080]  It's not that perishable,
[30:40.080 --> 30:41.780]  but you don't want stuff that's been sitting around
[30:41.780 --> 30:43.780]  on shelves for weeks and weeks or even months
[30:43.780 --> 30:45.780]  like you might get in a supermarket.
[30:45.780 --> 30:47.900]  So here's what you can do to get Trace Pontas.
[30:47.900 --> 30:52.900]  You can go to their website, tracepontas.com,
[30:53.100 --> 30:56.060]  and just order a bag or a couple of bags
[30:56.060 --> 30:58.080]  or something like that to give it a shot.
[30:58.080 --> 31:00.820]  You can also go to Amazon and search for it,
[31:00.820 --> 31:02.820]  and you can get it there if it's more convenient
[31:02.820 --> 31:04.620]  because then you can do the old one-click thing.
[31:04.620 --> 31:06.880]  And when you buy Trace Pontas coffee on Amazon,
[31:06.880 --> 31:08.500]  they're just using Amazon as a storefront.
[31:08.500 --> 31:10.260]  They still fulfill it themselves.
[31:10.260 --> 31:12.500]  It's not coming out of an Amazon warehouse somewhere
[31:12.500 --> 31:13.580]  where it's been sitting on the shelves.
[31:13.580 --> 31:14.900]  Trace Pontas still fulfills it.
[31:14.900 --> 31:18.300]  They just go through Amazon for the convenience of it.
[31:18.300 --> 31:20.060]  And the other thing they have
[31:20.060 --> 31:22.140]  is you can get a coffee subscription
[31:22.140 --> 31:24.020]  and you get freshly roasted beans sent to you
[31:24.020 --> 31:26.580]  every one, two, or four weeks,
[31:26.580 --> 31:29.540]  your choice when you sign up for the subscription,
[31:29.540 --> 31:32.820]  and you save 10% when you get a subscription
[31:32.820 --> 31:35.440]  compared to the regular price of the coffee.
[31:35.440 --> 31:37.980]  But listeners of the talk show get an extra 10% off
[31:37.980 --> 31:41.180]  by using the code thetalkshow at checkout
[31:41.180 --> 31:43.580]  when buying a coffee subscription.
[31:43.580 --> 31:47.460]  So you save a total of 20% off every bag with that code.
[31:48.340 --> 31:49.340]  I hope I used your code.
[31:49.340 --> 31:51.340]  I don't know, enter the code at checkout.
[31:51.340 --> 31:53.100]  That's where you do it if you're looking for it.
[31:53.100 --> 31:57.860]  And again, their website is tracepontas.com,
[31:57.860 --> 32:02.500]  T-R-E-S-P-O-N-T-A-S dot com.
[32:05.060 --> 32:06.180]  Picking up where we dropped off.
[32:06.180 --> 32:08.540]  So I think that Apple has fallen too in love
[32:08.540 --> 32:12.040]  with the name MacBook Pro to obsess on naming.
[32:12.040 --> 32:16.360]  And I think it's exemplified with the iMac Pro.
[32:16.360 --> 32:19.880]  Like, what is the difference between a 5K,
[32:19.880 --> 32:24.880]  27-inch regular iMac and the iMac Pro?
[32:24.920 --> 32:29.800]  Well, there's the cosmetic difference where it's space gray,
[32:29.800 --> 32:32.680]  which also, of course, makes it run a little faster.
[32:32.680 --> 32:35.480]  And you get the, you know, you get the black mouse
[32:35.480 --> 32:37.000]  and the black keyboard.
[32:37.000 --> 32:39.040]  Maybe some racing stripes might make it
[32:39.040 --> 32:40.320]  even like 10% faster.
[32:40.320 --> 32:42.160]  But at a, you know, joking aside,
[32:42.160 --> 32:43.280]  but it is the same display.
[32:43.280 --> 32:46.400]  But the, so the regular iMac has a great display
[32:46.400 --> 32:48.400]  that is great for totally professional use,
[32:48.400 --> 32:49.920]  graphic designers, all sorts of people,
[32:49.920 --> 32:52.040]  or photographers and stuff like that.
[32:52.040 --> 32:53.040]  All the real difference,
[32:53.040 --> 32:55.080]  the reason it's so much more expensive
[32:55.080 --> 32:57.680]  than a regular iMac has to do with technical details
[32:57.680 --> 33:00.120]  that are genuinely professional components.
[33:00.120 --> 33:04.220]  You know, Xeon processors versus whatever the, you know,
[33:04.220 --> 33:06.360]  retail, I don't even know what they're called.
[33:06.360 --> 33:07.480]  I-9s and I-7s.
[33:07.480 --> 33:10.320]  Right, whatever they are, who cares?
[33:10.320 --> 33:12.200]  And even that's, I mean, even that's like,
[33:12.200 --> 33:15.760]  about 40% is just Intel marketing BS.
[33:15.760 --> 33:18.040]  The iMac Pro, I've already forgotten,
[33:18.040 --> 33:20.600]  but I'm pretty sure it uses the different kind of RAM.
[33:20.600 --> 33:21.440]  Yep, ECC.
[33:21.440 --> 33:22.520]  ECC RAM.
[33:22.520 --> 33:23.560]  All sorts of stuff like that,
[33:23.560 --> 33:26.920]  that truly are pro components.
[33:26.920 --> 33:30.120]  And all sorts of other industries
[33:30.120 --> 33:32.720]  have similar type distinctions.
[33:32.720 --> 33:34.460]  Like one I'm vaguely familiar with
[33:34.460 --> 33:38.440]  as a amateur photo enthusiast is,
[33:38.440 --> 33:42.880]  like when you buy, get into the Canon ecosystem of cameras,
[33:42.880 --> 33:45.560]  and they have their L series of lenses.
[33:45.560 --> 33:47.600]  I don't even know what L stands for, do you know?
[33:47.600 --> 33:48.640]  I don't, I have no idea.
[33:48.640 --> 33:50.080]  All I know is that it means expensive,
[33:50.080 --> 33:51.040]  red ring, and good.
[33:51.040 --> 33:55.040]  Right, well, and white, if they're not entirely black,
[33:55.040 --> 33:58.680]  the L series often has like a white part to it.
[33:58.680 --> 33:59.520]  You know, if you know what to look for.
[33:59.520 --> 34:01.040]  Yeah, the telephotos are all white.
[34:01.040 --> 34:01.880]  Right, the telephotos.
[34:01.880 --> 34:03.040]  The big, long telephotos on sticks
[34:03.040 --> 34:04.280]  that you see at sporting games
[34:04.280 --> 34:05.800]  are all very intentionally white
[34:05.800 --> 34:07.360]  with a red ring on the outside.
[34:07.360 --> 34:08.920]  And if you're just looking, you know,
[34:08.920 --> 34:12.560]  a typical punter, as they would say in the UK,
[34:12.560 --> 34:14.480]  you know, just looking for a nice camera
[34:14.480 --> 34:17.480]  and you're willing to spend up to like $2,000
[34:17.480 --> 34:20.360]  on the whole kit, you're not looking at L series lenses.
[34:20.360 --> 34:22.000]  You know, they're for pros.
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.720]  And there's just no ifs, ands, or buts about it.
[34:24.720 --> 34:25.880]  And it isn't just about price.
[34:25.880 --> 34:28.000]  It's about like they add features
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.380]  that a lot of consumers wouldn't care about
[34:30.380 --> 34:31.720]  that pros really need.
[34:31.720 --> 34:35.280]  Right, well, and they also add downsides
[34:35.280 --> 34:37.720]  that amateurs would be annoyed by.
[34:37.720 --> 34:39.760]  Right, they're big and heavy, they're expensive.
[34:39.760 --> 34:41.740]  Everybody always says, so famously,
[34:41.740 --> 34:44.000]  everybody says you wanna get serious about photography
[34:44.000 --> 34:46.280]  and you have an interchangeable lens camera,
[34:46.280 --> 34:48.960]  you gotta get a 50 millimeter or equivalent
[34:48.960 --> 34:50.480]  if you're using different sensors.
[34:50.480 --> 34:53.060]  If you're talking in 35 millimeter sensor size,
[34:53.060 --> 34:54.800]  get a 50 millimeter fixed lens
[34:55.960 --> 34:57.920]  and stick that on your camera for a few months
[34:57.920 --> 34:58.980]  and don't even take it off
[34:58.980 --> 35:01.240]  and just learn to shoot with that one lens.
[35:01.240 --> 35:04.040]  So, and it, you know, the quote unquote nifty 50
[35:04.040 --> 35:07.160]  is like $100.
[35:07.160 --> 35:11.280]  You get, and it's way better lens, you know, optically
[35:11.280 --> 35:13.320]  because a 50 millimeter fixed lens.
[35:13.320 --> 35:18.160]  Anyway, there's also a like three or $400 50 millimeter lens
[35:18.160 --> 35:20.520]  which is just made out, it's less plastic,
[35:20.520 --> 35:23.560]  it's sturdier, it's better, but it's not that heavy.
[35:23.560 --> 35:25.460]  And then there's the L series one,
[35:25.460 --> 35:27.160]  which I bought because I'm an idiot
[35:27.160 --> 35:31.200]  because it goes all the way down to F 1.2.
[35:31.200 --> 35:34.440]  So it's, you know, even better in low light.
[35:34.440 --> 35:37.160]  And it weighs like six times more.
[35:37.160 --> 35:40.060]  It is a very, very heavy piece of glass.
[35:40.860 --> 35:44.840]  You know, it's a pro level 50 millimeter lens,
[35:44.840 --> 35:48.920]  but you pay a price that a typical consumer wouldn't.
[35:48.920 --> 35:51.140]  And a photographer of my abilities,
[35:51.140 --> 35:54.560]  I'm not really capturing better images with that lens
[35:54.560 --> 35:57.960]  than I would be with the $400 50 millimeter lens.
[35:57.960 --> 35:58.800]  That's a lot lighter.
[35:58.800 --> 36:00.280]  I was just an idiot.
[36:00.280 --> 36:04.000]  Yeah, and yeah, we have that 1.2 L as well.
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.840]  Tiff bought it because you bought it, thanks a lot.
[36:06.840 --> 36:09.440]  Well, I got it because of Dr. Wave.
[36:09.440 --> 36:11.480]  We can all blame Dr. Wave, thanks a lot.
[36:12.480 --> 36:15.240]  But yeah, and we also, before that we had the 1.4
[36:15.240 --> 36:17.280]  and the, you know, which is a $300 one,
[36:17.280 --> 36:18.340]  and it was totally fine.
[36:18.340 --> 36:20.600]  And in fact, in some ways the pro one was worse
[36:20.600 --> 36:22.620]  in some, like, because it not only is it bigger, heavier,
[36:22.620 --> 36:24.260]  and like four times the price,
[36:24.260 --> 36:27.020]  but it also, I think, focused a little bit more slowly.
[36:27.020 --> 36:28.080]  Like, it was, because there was, like,
[36:28.080 --> 36:29.280]  so much more glass to move.
[36:29.280 --> 36:30.120]  Like, everything about it.
[36:30.120 --> 36:33.320]  Like, it was worse in some pretty key ways,
[36:33.320 --> 36:35.480]  but the reason why pros would want that
[36:35.480 --> 36:38.640]  is because it was optically noticeably better.
[36:38.640 --> 36:41.320]  It could go down to 1.2 if you actually needed that,
[36:41.320 --> 36:42.760]  although almost nobody does.
[36:42.760 --> 36:45.360]  It was probably at least lightly weather sealed,
[36:45.360 --> 36:46.600]  which is another thing that, like,
[36:46.600 --> 36:49.780]  the consumer lenses don't, they hardly ever are.
[36:49.780 --> 36:51.680]  And, you know, most people don't need that.
[36:51.680 --> 36:54.840]  But if you're, like, you know, shooting a sports game,
[36:54.840 --> 36:56.320]  like, you wouldn't be using a 50 millimeter prime,
[36:56.320 --> 36:57.880]  but if you were, like, you know,
[36:57.880 --> 37:00.400]  a lot of pro contexts need, you know,
[37:00.400 --> 37:02.580]  weather sealing and more rugged abilities,
[37:02.580 --> 37:04.160]  different warranties, stuff like that.
[37:04.160 --> 37:06.200]  The big one on weather sealing for pros
[37:06.200 --> 37:07.600]  are pros who go out in the field
[37:07.600 --> 37:10.080]  where there's dirt, sand, and things like that.
[37:10.080 --> 37:12.440]  And the weather sealing keeps stuff like that out
[37:12.440 --> 37:14.640]  when you cannot, you're on assignment
[37:14.640 --> 37:16.520]  from National Geographic
[37:16.520 --> 37:19.600]  and you're in the middle of a desert in Africa,
[37:19.600 --> 37:23.680]  you can't get your lens fixed until you're gone.
[37:23.680 --> 37:25.280]  And it's, you know, you can't just, like,
[37:25.280 --> 37:27.840]  oh, zip over to the camera shop and get a replacement.
[37:27.840 --> 37:29.520]  You need that reliability.
[37:29.520 --> 37:30.360]  Yeah.
[37:30.360 --> 37:32.720]  All the more reason, that example is a wonderful reason
[37:32.720 --> 37:35.600]  why this MacBook Pro keyboard was so problematic.
[37:35.600 --> 37:39.120]  I shouldn't speak so poorly of that 50 millimeter lens
[37:39.120 --> 37:40.720]  because what I should do is sell it.
[37:40.720 --> 37:42.400]  And here I am telling the people
[37:42.400 --> 37:44.520]  who are most likely to buy it, the listeners of my show,
[37:44.520 --> 37:46.200]  that I kind of think it's a waste of money.
[37:46.200 --> 37:49.040]  Because the other reason I regret it in hindsight
[37:49.040 --> 37:52.360]  is that the sensitivity of,
[37:52.360 --> 37:55.320]  the ISO sensitivity of digital sensors
[37:55.320 --> 38:00.280]  got, continues to get so much better, so much faster,
[38:00.280 --> 38:02.640]  that even if, in just like 18 months
[38:02.640 --> 38:05.280]  after I bought that lens, like five or six years ago,
[38:05.280 --> 38:07.640]  I could get better low light pictures
[38:07.640 --> 38:11.160]  with the lighter weight camera just by getting a new camera.
[38:12.160 --> 38:16.880]  Yeah, like I haven't shot anything below f2.8 in years.
[38:16.880 --> 38:17.720]  Well.
[38:17.720 --> 38:20.600]  But other than that, usually I'm up around like 4, 5.6
[38:20.600 --> 38:24.600]  because I'm much more likely to miss the focus slightly
[38:24.600 --> 38:27.760]  than I am to need the higher speeds.
[38:27.760 --> 38:30.000]  And so for me, it's much more important
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  to set the aperture a little bit narrower
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.320]  to increase the chances that my subject will be in focus.
[38:34.320 --> 38:35.160]  Right.
[38:35.160 --> 38:37.280]  Anyway, to get back to MacBook Pros.
[38:37.280 --> 38:42.280]  MacBook Pros are being used by people in totally,
[38:42.600 --> 38:45.720]  like the iMac of the MacBook lineup
[38:45.720 --> 38:48.680]  are the lower end 13-inch MacBook Pros.
[38:48.680 --> 38:50.600]  Right, they're the standard,
[38:50.600 --> 38:54.000]  just like a really nice retina display,
[38:54.000 --> 38:59.000]  fast MacBook computer, but they're called MacBook Pros.
[38:59.640 --> 39:04.160]  And I kind of feel that's boxed Apple into a corner, like,
[39:04.160 --> 39:07.080]  and to go to this specific machine
[39:07.080 --> 39:07.960]  that I'm touching right now,
[39:07.960 --> 39:11.360]  the Core i9 highest end 15-inch MacBook Pro,
[39:12.720 --> 39:13.800]  there is no real,
[39:13.800 --> 39:17.720]  there's no iMac Pro of the MacBook lineup anymore.
[39:17.720 --> 39:21.320]  There is no big jump like the way,
[39:21.320 --> 39:22.600]  you know, in technical ways,
[39:22.600 --> 39:26.600]  the ways that the iMac Pro is truly remarkable,
[39:26.600 --> 39:31.260]  remarkably capable compared to a high-end regular iMac.
[39:31.260 --> 39:34.020]  There is no jump like that in the MacBook Pro lineup.
[39:34.020 --> 39:35.080]  Well, maybe there kind of is.
[39:35.080 --> 39:38.120]  So it's, there is no real equivalent to the iMac Pro
[39:38.120 --> 39:40.640]  in things like, you know, like the Xeon CPU,
[39:40.640 --> 39:41.480]  like using like, you know,
[39:41.480 --> 39:43.360]  like a workstation grade processor and everything.
[39:43.360 --> 39:44.360]  Yeah, there is none of that,
[39:44.360 --> 39:49.140]  but in some ways you could argue that the 13-inch and 15-inch
[39:49.140 --> 39:52.760]  are much more like the 5K iMac than the iMac Pro
[39:52.760 --> 39:55.000]  in the sense that like they use high-end,
[39:55.000 --> 39:56.320]  but mostly still consumer parts.
[39:56.320 --> 39:59.280]  But I wonder if things, you know, obviously the touch bar,
[39:59.280 --> 40:01.120]  if Apple's keeping it around,
[40:01.120 --> 40:02.280]  honestly, I still hope they don't,
[40:02.280 --> 40:04.040]  but if they are keeping it around,
[40:04.040 --> 40:07.000]  that is probably gonna be maintained as a Pro feature,
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.720]  although I honestly think that makes no sense as one.
[40:09.720 --> 40:11.760]  But what about things like the T2, right?
[40:11.760 --> 40:13.920]  Because the T2, they introduced it in the iMac Pro,
[40:13.920 --> 40:17.700]  now it's in the 13 and 15-inch touch bar with this here.
[40:17.700 --> 40:19.560]  Maybe that doesn't go down the line.
[40:19.560 --> 40:23.800]  Like maybe the T2 is only like, you know,
[40:23.800 --> 40:26.340]  it has that faster disk controller,
[40:26.340 --> 40:28.500]  it has more advanced encryption and security,
[40:28.500 --> 40:31.080]  things like FileVault are like quote free now.
[40:31.080 --> 40:33.860]  So what if the T2 is the segmentation
[40:33.860 --> 40:36.580]  since like the Xeon can't be anymore?
[40:37.640 --> 40:38.920]  But, you know, they still,
[40:38.920 --> 40:40.720]  if you're gonna draw that distinction,
[40:40.720 --> 40:42.520]  I think the place you draw it right now is clear.
[40:42.520 --> 40:43.520]  The place you draw it right now
[40:43.520 --> 40:46.080]  is touch bar and above is Pro,
[40:46.080 --> 40:50.320]  and Escape and MacBook are not,
[40:50.320 --> 40:51.520]  which is just all the more reason
[40:51.520 --> 40:55.120]  why I think renaming the MacBook Escape to MacBook,
[40:55.960 --> 40:58.840]  that makes so much more sense than what they're doing now.
[40:58.840 --> 41:03.120]  Because right now, by having almost all of the laptops
[41:03.120 --> 41:07.380]  that are recent models be named MacBook Pro,
[41:07.380 --> 41:09.080]  it's like, you know, it's like,
[41:09.080 --> 41:12.280]  what would Anger Merlin would be like if all the items
[41:12.280 --> 41:14.120]  in a to-do list were marked high priority?
[41:14.120 --> 41:15.100]  Like that's kinda how it is.
[41:15.100 --> 41:17.440]  It's like, these are all the best MacBooks.
[41:17.440 --> 41:18.680]  Well, no, they're obviously not.
[41:18.680 --> 41:20.000]  Like that's not how that works.
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.040]  You have to draw that line somewhere
[41:22.040 --> 41:23.760]  and just saying that what,
[41:23.760 --> 41:26.520]  like the bottom end one you have, this 12 inch one,
[41:26.520 --> 41:29.920]  just saying that is not Pro makes no sense at all.
[41:29.920 --> 41:34.000]  Right, you know, the thing that,
[41:34.000 --> 41:35.800]  to get into the specifics of this model,
[41:35.800 --> 41:38.040]  the thing that still has people,
[41:38.040 --> 41:40.420]  has, what is it, a Beezener bonnet,
[41:40.420 --> 41:45.420]  is this idea that the Core i9 in this machine is not,
[41:45.600 --> 41:48.480]  even post bug fix, is not running,
[41:48.480 --> 41:52.200]  it's not maintaining its highest base level of performance
[41:52.200 --> 41:55.120]  as long as it theoretically could.
[41:55.120 --> 41:58.400]  And as long as the same processor does
[41:58.400 --> 42:02.720]  in certain PC laptops that are typically described
[42:02.720 --> 42:05.280]  as gaming laptops because they're like five or six pounds
[42:05.280 --> 42:07.680]  and very thick because they have it significantly,
[42:07.680 --> 42:09.480]  just cooling systems.
[42:09.480 --> 42:11.800]  It's all about cooling and to get,
[42:11.800 --> 42:14.480]  to have a cooling system that can let it run
[42:14.480 --> 42:18.000]  at clock speeds that it's capable of,
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.300]  it's just impossible in today's world
[42:20.300 --> 42:21.880]  to do it in this form factor.
[42:21.880 --> 42:25.340]  So in theory, what some people obviously
[42:25.340 --> 42:26.640]  are dying for Apple to do,
[42:26.640 --> 42:27.640]  and I don't think they're going to do,
[42:27.640 --> 42:31.280]  is make a thicker 15 inch or go back to 17 inch
[42:31.280 --> 42:34.240]  or something like that to make a bigger, heavier system
[42:34.240 --> 42:37.120]  that can just, all I want is for it to run
[42:37.120 --> 42:38.120]  as fast as it can.
[42:39.320 --> 42:43.160]  Yeah, and back when this controversy was erupting last week,
[42:43.160 --> 42:46.440]  I was more perturbed than I am now
[42:46.440 --> 42:48.800]  about the fact that it wasn't maintaining the base clock.
[42:48.800 --> 42:50.440]  Now I know more about how this stuff works
[42:50.440 --> 42:53.340]  than I knew last week and now I know things
[42:53.340 --> 42:58.340]  like how modern Intel CPUs in the high end laptop like this
[42:58.500 --> 43:00.320]  almost never can maintain their base clock
[43:00.320 --> 43:01.800]  for long periods of time.
[43:01.800 --> 43:03.920]  Almost all of them, even last year's models,
[43:03.920 --> 43:06.320]  ever since Kaby Lake and now Coffee Lake,
[43:06.320 --> 43:08.920]  these processors are, because of Intel's problems
[43:08.920 --> 43:10.920]  moving away from 14 nanometer,
[43:10.920 --> 43:14.040]  these processors are cramming way more transistors
[43:14.040 --> 43:15.840]  and way higher clock speeds
[43:15.840 --> 43:18.600]  into this old manufacturing technology
[43:18.600 --> 43:19.980]  than what it was ever intended for
[43:19.980 --> 43:21.920]  and what these laptops were intended for.
[43:21.920 --> 43:23.840]  So Intel is really pushing the boundaries
[43:23.840 --> 43:27.440]  to try to get better performing chips out every year
[43:27.440 --> 43:30.600]  when they can't move forward on their process yet
[43:30.600 --> 43:32.840]  that the laptops are having to deal
[43:32.840 --> 43:34.960]  with higher and higher thermals.
[43:34.960 --> 43:39.280]  And so part of my easing on my anger on this
[43:39.280 --> 43:42.320]  was just learning that yeah, this is actually not new,
[43:42.320 --> 43:44.720]  that many of the laptops recently can't maintain
[43:44.720 --> 43:47.720]  max base clock under parallel workloads
[43:47.720 --> 43:50.000]  for more than a half hour or something like that.
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.800]  But also I've learned that the PC world
[43:52.800 --> 43:54.080]  is having the exact same struggles,
[43:54.080 --> 43:57.020]  that it is, and this doesn't necessarily make it okay,
[43:57.020 --> 43:59.700]  but it is nice to know it isn't just Apple messing up here,
[43:59.700 --> 44:04.660]  that other PC laptops that are considered thin lights
[44:04.660 --> 44:05.920]  that have these processors in them
[44:05.920 --> 44:08.160]  are actually in worse shape usually,
[44:08.160 --> 44:10.880]  that usually either they cool it worse
[44:10.880 --> 44:13.280]  or they're cooling these same chips
[44:13.280 --> 44:16.840]  to roughly the same performance level, but with more noise.
[44:16.840 --> 44:19.120]  And so the only thing that Apple
[44:19.120 --> 44:21.040]  is not competing well against here
[44:21.040 --> 44:23.120]  is what you mentioned, basically the gaming laptops,
[44:23.120 --> 44:25.360]  which are really, they look ridiculous.
[44:25.360 --> 44:26.920]  I mean, I've never even seen one in real life,
[44:26.920 --> 44:28.800]  but I've seen the pictures of,
[44:28.800 --> 44:31.140]  they're basically an inch thick on the bottom
[44:31.140 --> 44:33.480]  and they have these giant vents on all the sides
[44:33.480 --> 44:34.920]  and they're apparently very loud,
[44:34.920 --> 44:36.880]  because of course, to fit a big fan of it,
[44:36.880 --> 44:37.720]  they have to be very loud.
[44:37.720 --> 44:39.220]  And so that's something that like-
[44:39.220 --> 44:42.000]  What aspect of that description
[44:42.000 --> 44:44.340]  is the most offensive to Apple?
[44:46.340 --> 44:48.640]  I don't know if Johnny Ive is a noise nut,
[44:48.640 --> 44:50.400]  but he probably is.
[44:50.400 --> 44:52.960]  That's one thing I don't know if I can say about him.
[44:52.960 --> 44:55.900]  We certainly know what his aesthetic tastes are,
[44:55.900 --> 45:00.320]  and thicker, heavier, big grill type vent.
[45:00.320 --> 45:02.120]  Yeah, Apple's been doing very well
[45:02.120 --> 45:05.680]  with, for years, on keeping their stuff quiet.
[45:05.680 --> 45:07.160]  They've been great on fan noise
[45:07.160 --> 45:09.400]  and they've been getting better and better at it.
[45:09.400 --> 45:11.400]  And so that's why one of the reasons I'm so impressed
[45:11.400 --> 45:14.420]  by the iMac Pro is that it is silent
[45:14.420 --> 45:16.100]  with everything I throw at it.
[45:16.100 --> 45:18.080]  I've only heard of people saying if you max out
[45:18.080 --> 45:21.220]  the CPU and the GPU, then you can hear the fan.
[45:21.220 --> 45:22.060]  I've never done that.
[45:22.060 --> 45:24.400]  I just max out the CPU and the GPU sits mostly idle.
[45:24.400 --> 45:26.680]  So you can do whatever you want to the CPU and the iMac Pro
[45:26.680 --> 45:28.100]  and you won't hear it, it's fantastic.
[45:28.100 --> 45:31.360]  And so yeah, those giant gaming laptops,
[45:31.360 --> 45:33.000]  that's not a product Apple's ever gonna make.
[45:33.000 --> 45:34.920]  Even if the market demands it,
[45:34.920 --> 45:37.320]  they will never be able to swallow their Apple-ness
[45:37.320 --> 45:38.200]  and make that.
[45:39.640 --> 45:40.480]  They would not do that.
[45:40.480 --> 45:42.200]  Right, I don't know if Johnny Ive, in particular,
[45:42.200 --> 45:43.460]  is annoyed, and I suspect he is,
[45:43.460 --> 45:46.240]  but I know that Apple, institutionally, is.
[45:46.240 --> 45:49.000]  And that's part of, one of the most fun things I've done
[45:49.000 --> 45:51.520]  in recent years was the behind-the-scenes tour
[45:51.520 --> 45:55.360]  of their audio testing lab, either right before
[45:55.360 --> 45:58.600]  or right after HomePod came out, I think right before.
[45:58.600 --> 46:01.280]  But you guys remember, it was earlier this year,
[46:01.280 --> 46:03.580]  like March, I think, maybe February,
[46:04.760 --> 46:08.000]  where a bunch of us in the media were invited to Apple
[46:08.000 --> 46:10.920]  and they gave us this tour of an entire building
[46:12.420 --> 46:14.600]  right across the street from the old Infinite Loop
[46:14.600 --> 46:18.380]  where all they do is test,
[46:18.380 --> 46:21.320]  I mean, they had all new rooms just for the HomePod,
[46:21.320 --> 46:23.240]  amazing new rooms that they built,
[46:23.240 --> 46:25.560]  specifically and only for HomePod.
[46:25.560 --> 46:29.080]  But the whole room, the whole team started as a place
[46:29.080 --> 46:32.520]  where they took all of their products.
[46:32.520 --> 46:35.680]  They even tested the noise, the ambient noise
[46:35.680 --> 46:39.080]  that an iPod made back when the iPods made noise
[46:39.080 --> 46:40.600]  because they had hard drives,
[46:40.600 --> 46:45.240]  these little tiny microwave-size anechoic chambers
[46:45.240 --> 46:47.960]  where they'd put an iPod and have it play and test
[46:47.960 --> 46:49.000]  to make it quiet.
[46:49.000 --> 46:51.760]  So the idea that they're going to make something
[46:51.760 --> 46:55.920]  that, fan noise aside, it'll run a Core i9
[46:55.920 --> 46:57.720]  as fast as theoretically possible,
[46:57.720 --> 46:59.160]  that's never going to happen.
[46:59.160 --> 47:01.720]  Yeah, basically, I think one of the conclusions
[47:01.720 --> 47:04.080]  I've come to with this whole i9 throttling thing
[47:04.080 --> 47:09.080]  is that laptops, if you want a very high-performance laptop,
[47:09.640 --> 47:12.280]  it's a bigger compromise than it's ever been
[47:12.280 --> 47:16.080]  because you can't, in what people want in laptops,
[47:16.080 --> 47:18.980]  which is they want them to be as portable as possible,
[47:18.980 --> 47:20.480]  they want them to be reasonably lightweight,
[47:20.480 --> 47:21.480]  they don't want them to be super thick
[47:21.480 --> 47:22.800]  and covered in vents unless they're gamers,
[47:22.800 --> 47:25.400]  but that market is well-served elsewhere.
[47:25.400 --> 47:29.000]  So what people want in a laptop is completely at odds
[47:29.000 --> 47:30.960]  with what a high-performance system needs
[47:30.960 --> 47:35.360]  in terms of thermals, battery, power, and noise.
[47:35.360 --> 47:39.560]  And so the path to happiness in a laptop
[47:39.560 --> 47:44.320]  is either to go lower spec, I think,
[47:44.320 --> 47:46.480]  like make it not need to be so powerful
[47:46.480 --> 47:48.240]  and go with something like an eGPU if those are good,
[47:48.240 --> 47:49.940]  although honestly, I can't vouch for that yet
[47:49.940 --> 47:51.100]  because it's too early to know
[47:51.100 --> 47:51.940]  whether those are actually good
[47:51.940 --> 47:54.320]  or whether there's annoyances or big limitations
[47:54.320 --> 47:55.840]  or bugs or whatever else, so who knows.
[47:55.840 --> 47:58.620]  But hopefully that'll pan out well.
[47:58.620 --> 48:03.620]  Or if you need all that power, really consider a desktop
[48:04.760 --> 48:06.880]  because desktops are so good now.
[48:06.880 --> 48:08.560]  And I feel like trying to,
[48:08.560 --> 48:09.980]  like the machine you have in front of you here,
[48:09.980 --> 48:13.020]  there's like maxed out i9 15-inch,
[48:13.020 --> 48:15.640]  has so many crazy compromises and limitations
[48:15.640 --> 48:18.960]  if you actually need to use all the power it has,
[48:18.960 --> 48:20.800]  it's not fun.
[48:20.800 --> 48:23.040]  The only advantage it has is you can take it anywhere
[48:23.040 --> 48:25.520]  and you can just have one computer
[48:25.520 --> 48:26.400]  and you can bring it on a plane
[48:26.400 --> 48:27.760]  and have all that power with you.
[48:27.760 --> 48:28.600]  And a lot of people need that
[48:28.600 --> 48:29.760]  and that's why they buy these things.
[48:29.760 --> 48:31.880]  But to me, the path to happiness in a laptop
[48:31.880 --> 48:34.320]  is closer to the middle of the lineup.
[48:34.320 --> 48:36.120]  Tell your boss you need to upgrade to first class
[48:36.120 --> 48:39.000]  because you need to work on your 15-inch MacBook Pro
[48:39.000 --> 48:40.640]  while you're on the plane.
[48:40.640 --> 48:42.120]  It requires a business requirement.
[48:42.120 --> 48:43.240]  And I hope you have seat power.
[48:43.240 --> 48:44.080]  Right.
[48:44.080 --> 48:48.080]  I don't, yeah, I guess if you need the power, yeah.
[48:48.080 --> 48:50.360]  Oh yeah, I mean, battery life on these,
[48:50.360 --> 48:51.680]  there was that controversy when they came out
[48:51.680 --> 48:52.560]  with consumer reports and everything,
[48:52.560 --> 48:56.400]  but battery life on the modern laptops.
[48:56.400 --> 48:59.800]  What we have, we have laptops getting thinner and lighter
[48:59.800 --> 49:01.200]  and the batteries are shrinking
[49:01.200 --> 49:02.560]  because if you're just sitting around
[49:02.560 --> 49:04.120]  typing email and browsing the web,
[49:04.120 --> 49:05.840]  they're getting more efficient than ever.
[49:05.840 --> 49:07.320]  But if you're actually pushing that power,
[49:07.320 --> 49:08.960]  if you're actually using that processor,
[49:08.960 --> 49:11.600]  using the GPU, if you're pushing it,
[49:11.600 --> 49:13.280]  they have worse battery life than ever
[49:13.280 --> 49:16.720]  because they're designed for this low idle envelope
[49:16.720 --> 49:19.560]  and once you push it, once you're doing something with it,
[49:19.560 --> 49:21.520]  you're really having a problem with that battery
[49:21.520 --> 49:23.760]  if you're on a long flight with no power.
[49:23.760 --> 49:26.000]  Yeah, although I will say in terms of battery life,
[49:26.000 --> 49:27.400]  this machine in front of me,
[49:27.400 --> 49:28.840]  I've been running on battery power
[49:28.840 --> 49:32.160]  ever since we came into Marco's office to record this show
[49:32.160 --> 49:35.160]  and the battery meter still says 100%.
[49:35.160 --> 49:37.640]  Now I'm not pushing the limits of this.
[49:37.640 --> 49:40.560]  The show is being recorded into audio hijack
[49:40.560 --> 49:42.720]  over on Marco's iMac Pro,
[49:42.720 --> 49:46.200]  but I've got my, I've got all my regular apps running,
[49:46.200 --> 49:48.320]  mail, Safari, lots of tabs,
[49:48.320 --> 49:50.480]  and the display is on and fairly bright.
[49:50.480 --> 49:52.760]  And it still says 100%.
[49:52.760 --> 49:54.720]  So it was like what you're doing there is like typical,
[49:54.720 --> 49:57.040]  like, you know, a light productivity workload,
[49:57.040 --> 49:58.720]  web browsing, email, stuff like that,
[49:58.720 --> 50:00.240]  and you're barely interacting with it at all.
[50:00.240 --> 50:01.960]  Like, so that's even lighter.
[50:01.960 --> 50:03.200]  It's like, it's optimized for that.
[50:03.200 --> 50:05.120]  And the chips now are so good at power management
[50:05.120 --> 50:06.880]  when they're being lowly, you know,
[50:06.880 --> 50:08.840]  lowly utilized, I guess, minimally utilized,
[50:08.840 --> 50:10.440]  like, then they're great at that.
[50:10.440 --> 50:12.960]  And it could probably last 15 hours like that.
[50:12.960 --> 50:14.800]  But if you try to like, you know,
[50:14.800 --> 50:16.040]  export something from Final Cut,
[50:16.040 --> 50:17.080]  we'll have a very different story.
[50:17.080 --> 50:18.480]  Yeah, I've, you know, it's funny,
[50:18.480 --> 50:20.800]  we were talking about this off the show earlier,
[50:20.800 --> 50:23.720]  but in the days that I've been testing this machine here
[50:23.720 --> 50:25.240]  and seeing how the battery performs,
[50:25.240 --> 50:27.360]  I've rethought an assumption
[50:27.360 --> 50:29.240]  that I came up with a few years ago.
[50:29.240 --> 50:31.600]  So the last time I personally bought a MacBook
[50:31.600 --> 50:36.600]  was my mid-2014 13-inch MacBook Pro.
[50:36.960 --> 50:39.440]  And I just maxed out everything.
[50:39.440 --> 50:41.200]  I got the most RAM I could get,
[50:41.200 --> 50:43.600]  which was 16 gigabytes, sounds terrible today.
[50:44.640 --> 50:48.040]  I got the fastest processor they sold at the time,
[50:48.040 --> 50:52.160]  and, you know, I think the max SSD, which was one terabyte.
[50:53.160 --> 50:54.240]  And it was all money well spent
[50:54.240 --> 50:56.160]  because here I am four years later still using it,
[50:56.160 --> 50:58.240]  still not really thinking about replacing it.
[50:58.240 --> 51:00.600]  You know, like, that's my style of Mac,
[51:00.600 --> 51:02.020]  you know, I buy a new iPhone every year,
[51:02.020 --> 51:04.220]  but my style of buying a Mac is to get one,
[51:04.220 --> 51:05.920]  only when I really feel like I need it,
[51:05.920 --> 51:09.840]  and then max it out and hopefully use it for many years,
[51:09.840 --> 51:13.440]  because I just hate configuring a new machine just so.
[51:14.360 --> 51:15.780]  And I love having one, like,
[51:15.780 --> 51:18.720]  once I'm past, like, that year 18-month mark
[51:18.720 --> 51:21.880]  where I feel like any kind of lemon component might blow,
[51:21.880 --> 51:25.080]  I feel like it's, this thing is reliable, you know?
[51:25.080 --> 51:28.400]  And my MacBook, my 2014 MacBook Pro I've been raving about
[51:28.400 --> 51:30.600]  has never needed service for anything.
[51:30.600 --> 51:34.220]  Not one case of anything has anything ever gone wrong in it.
[51:34.220 --> 51:35.060]  So I love that.
[51:36.320 --> 51:38.400]  But I was thinking when I bought it,
[51:38.400 --> 51:40.560]  and battery life has been good,
[51:40.560 --> 51:42.460]  it's good enough that I'm still happy with it,
[51:42.460 --> 51:44.640]  but I never really pressed the CPU,
[51:44.640 --> 51:47.720]  and my thought was, I don't know why I maxed out the CPU.
[51:47.720 --> 51:49.960]  I don't do anything CPU-intensive,
[51:49.960 --> 51:54.960]  or else I do it so seldom that it's not worth buying
[51:55.000 --> 51:58.680]  and getting what I presume to be worse battery life
[51:58.680 --> 52:02.240]  because I'm running a faster CPU than I need,
[52:02.240 --> 52:03.780]  whereas the baseline CPU,
[52:03.780 --> 52:06.640]  like, I need the SSD versus the hard drive.
[52:06.640 --> 52:09.560]  I need the extra RAM because I'm such an idiot
[52:09.560 --> 52:13.080]  and keep dozens and dozens of Safari tabs open at all times.
[52:13.080 --> 52:15.440]  But I don't need CPU.
[52:15.440 --> 52:17.080]  But I think you're right looking at this,
[52:17.080 --> 52:20.220]  that even with this Core i9, which in theory,
[52:20.220 --> 52:22.840]  as a CPU could burn battery faster
[52:22.840 --> 52:24.920]  than any other CPU in the lineup
[52:24.920 --> 52:27.960]  just because it's got extra cores,
[52:27.960 --> 52:30.280]  that's the nature of the fastest CPU.
[52:30.280 --> 52:32.640]  But here, when I'm doing my typical workload,
[52:32.640 --> 52:36.920]  here I am literally 55 minutes into running on battery,
[52:36.920 --> 52:38.960]  and the battery meter still says 100%,
[52:38.960 --> 52:41.040]  still hasn't dropped to 99.
[52:41.040 --> 52:42.960]  So I think you're right, you know,
[52:42.960 --> 52:46.200]  that the power management when they don't need it is crazy.
[52:46.200 --> 52:48.880]  Yeah, and I wouldn't worry that you're burning extra power
[52:48.880 --> 52:50.000]  like when you're doing stuff like this
[52:50.000 --> 52:51.480]  as I think the power management is good enough
[52:51.480 --> 52:54.120]  that you don't have to worry that if you buy the high end CPU
[52:54.120 --> 52:56.760]  that your idle power will be much worse
[52:56.760 --> 52:57.600]  because it won't be.
[52:57.600 --> 53:01.120]  But I think what we've seen a lot in the recent generations
[53:01.120 --> 53:03.720]  is we're limited so much by thermals
[53:03.720 --> 53:06.480]  that the difference between whatever comes
[53:06.480 --> 53:09.280]  in the base model of a given size laptop
[53:09.280 --> 53:11.320]  and whatever the highest CPU is
[53:11.320 --> 53:13.280]  is not as big of a performance difference
[53:13.280 --> 53:14.480]  as you might think.
[53:14.480 --> 53:17.920]  Like usually it's within maybe 10, 15%
[53:17.920 --> 53:20.200]  from the base model to the highest end CPU.
[53:20.200 --> 53:22.840]  Even if the advertised clock speed might be big,
[53:22.840 --> 53:26.240]  like it might go from like 2.2 to 2.9,
[53:26.240 --> 53:27.780]  and so you'd think that would be a much bigger
[53:27.780 --> 53:29.720]  than 15% improvement.
[53:29.720 --> 53:31.440]  But in fact, you know, because of turbo boost
[53:31.440 --> 53:33.640]  and everything's so complicated now,
[53:33.640 --> 53:36.480]  ultimately if you're buying a new laptop,
[53:36.480 --> 53:39.500]  if you are concerned about bang for your buck,
[53:39.500 --> 53:42.560]  I would say get the most storage you can first
[53:42.560 --> 53:44.740]  and then RAM is second priority,
[53:44.740 --> 53:48.400]  and only upgrade the CPU if you really are okay
[53:48.400 --> 53:51.040]  losing that money because it matters so little.
[53:51.040 --> 53:53.480]  Most of the laptops I've had for the last decade,
[53:53.480 --> 53:55.960]  I've just had the base model CPU and it's been totally fine.
[53:55.960 --> 53:57.640]  I totally agree with that and one thing
[53:57.640 --> 53:59.040]  that I probably would have said differently
[53:59.040 --> 54:01.080]  five or six years ago is five or six years ago
[54:01.080 --> 54:04.800]  I probably would have said RAM first, storage second.
[54:04.800 --> 54:09.040]  But one of the differences between SSD and spinning disks
[54:09.040 --> 54:12.560]  is that if your machine does need to swap,
[54:12.560 --> 54:16.400]  which is when it starts writing stuff in memory to disk,
[54:16.400 --> 54:18.720]  yeah, I say disk, but you know.
[54:19.920 --> 54:22.680]  With a hard drive, it just was, it was just awful.
[54:22.680 --> 54:26.560]  It was just, as soon as you went to swap,
[54:26.560 --> 54:27.800]  I could tell right away.
[54:27.800 --> 54:30.160]  I would just be like, oh, I need to quit Safari
[54:30.160 --> 54:33.280]  and relaunch it because I could tell it swapped.
[54:33.280 --> 54:37.000]  Whereas with SSD, of course SSD is not as fast as RAM,
[54:37.000 --> 54:42.000]  but it is fast enough that it's, I think you're right.
[54:42.120 --> 54:44.480]  Prioritize SSD storage first, then RAM.
[54:44.480 --> 54:46.440]  And also, I think the calculus changed also
[54:46.440 --> 54:49.760]  because back 10 years ago, if your hard drive was filled up,
[54:49.760 --> 54:52.800]  you could upgrade it for not that much money.
[54:53.840 --> 54:56.480]  And today, you can't upgrade any of these specs anymore.
[54:56.480 --> 55:00.980]  So to me, and because I've occasionally been impatient
[55:00.980 --> 55:04.080]  and just walked to an Apple store and bought the base model
[55:04.080 --> 55:07.680]  then I've often had that 256 gig SSD.
[55:07.680 --> 55:11.880]  And man, it's like that killed the laptop for me.
[55:11.880 --> 55:13.800]  Like over time, what was the limiting factor
[55:13.800 --> 55:15.600]  that made me the most unhappy with it
[55:15.600 --> 55:17.480]  or made me have to jump through the most hoops
[55:17.480 --> 55:20.120]  or have the most limitations was disk space.
[55:20.120 --> 55:22.160]  And you can never upgrade it.
[55:22.160 --> 55:25.360]  So I kind of learned that lesson over two different laptops
[55:25.360 --> 55:27.520]  that I got that way and realized, okay,
[55:27.520 --> 55:30.480]  I'm now getting the 512 at least with whatever I do.
[55:30.480 --> 55:35.000]  So, all right, let's take another break here
[55:35.000 --> 55:36.760]  and thank our next sponsor.
[55:36.760 --> 55:40.040]  And our next sponsor is Mack Weldon.
[55:40.040 --> 55:41.760]  Mack Weldon's mission is simple,
[55:41.760 --> 55:43.540]  to make sure all of your basics and beyond
[55:43.540 --> 55:45.560]  are smartly designed and shopping from them
[55:45.560 --> 55:46.900]  is easy and convenient.
[55:46.900 --> 55:48.760]  What kind of basics are we talking about?
[55:48.760 --> 55:52.440]  We're talking about stuff like underwear, socks, T-shirts.
[55:53.520 --> 55:54.520]  They founded Mack Weldon
[55:54.520 --> 55:56.200]  because they wanted more out of the basics.
[55:56.200 --> 55:59.280]  And they always questioned how something so essential
[55:59.280 --> 56:01.880]  could be such a pain in the ass to buy.
[56:01.880 --> 56:05.160]  The frustration was real and their eureka moment happened
[56:05.160 --> 56:07.460]  in a department store aisle full of brands
[56:07.460 --> 56:09.320]  that dominated their top drawer.
[56:09.320 --> 56:12.220]  You know the big name ones, the ones that advertise on TV.
[56:13.320 --> 56:15.080]  Surrounded by a mind numbing assortment
[56:15.080 --> 56:17.200]  of underwear and socks, they realized
[56:17.200 --> 56:19.600]  that consistent fit and quality
[56:19.600 --> 56:20.920]  were really a game of roulette.
[56:20.920 --> 56:22.960]  You could buy a pack of T-shirts and like one of them,
[56:22.960 --> 56:26.300]  like the collar starts fraying like two times after your ward
[56:26.300 --> 56:28.120]  so they took matters into their own hands
[56:28.120 --> 56:29.880]  and they started from scratch
[56:29.880 --> 56:32.920]  and engineered even their own fabric.
[56:32.920 --> 56:35.120]  Mack Weldon stuff is not like white label stuff
[56:35.120 --> 56:37.680]  that they buy and just stick a Mack label label in,
[56:39.080 --> 56:41.000]  a Mack Weldon label in.
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.920]  They even engineered their own fabric.
[56:43.920 --> 56:46.280]  I've been wearing their stuff for years.
[56:46.280 --> 56:49.040]  I'm actually wearing a pair of Mack Weldon underwear
[56:49.040 --> 56:51.420]  right now literally as I record.
[56:51.420 --> 56:52.260]  Me too.
[56:52.260 --> 56:53.840]  And I have one of their shirts on.
[56:53.840 --> 56:55.120]  I do not have one of their shirts on
[56:55.120 --> 56:57.120]  but I am just wearing a novelty T-shirt.
[56:57.120 --> 57:01.120]  So if I had an undershirt on, it would be one of theirs.
[57:01.120 --> 57:03.680]  And I love, I don't like V-neck T-shirts
[57:03.680 --> 57:05.820]  but I love V-neck undershirts
[57:05.820 --> 57:07.460]  because then you don't see the shirt
[57:07.460 --> 57:09.520]  when you unbutton the top button.
[57:09.520 --> 57:12.400]  So I have an entire drawer full of white
[57:12.400 --> 57:15.320]  Mack Weldon V-neck T-shirts.
[57:15.320 --> 57:18.080]  I bought enough so that I would never have to worry
[57:18.080 --> 57:22.080]  that I don't have one on or don't have one ready to go.
[57:22.960 --> 57:24.280]  Really great stuff.
[57:24.280 --> 57:26.560]  I have a ton of their socks.
[57:26.560 --> 57:28.460]  I don't even know if I could count
[57:28.460 --> 57:30.080]  how many of their socks I have.
[57:30.080 --> 57:32.360]  And I know it sounds stupid.
[57:32.360 --> 57:34.200]  There are just things that I've gone through life
[57:34.200 --> 57:35.440]  and I just never thought about.
[57:35.440 --> 57:39.280]  And I spent decades of my life never thinking about socks.
[57:39.280 --> 57:43.820]  But it's crazy because every single thing about,
[57:43.820 --> 57:45.160]  every single thing I own,
[57:45.160 --> 57:48.300]  I always want something that I think is excellent.
[57:48.300 --> 57:50.000]  Like I like nice watches.
[57:50.000 --> 57:53.200]  I like, I care about what brand hat I wear.
[57:53.200 --> 57:55.120]  I, you know, last time I bought a car,
[57:55.120 --> 57:59.320]  I spent an inordinate amount of time researching it.
[57:59.320 --> 58:01.020]  Well, why did I not think about socks?
[58:01.020 --> 58:05.840]  Having nice socks is so much more comfortable
[58:05.840 --> 58:08.280]  than having ratty old socks that are like worn out
[58:08.280 --> 58:12.640]  and I don't know why I was like 40 something
[58:12.640 --> 58:14.360]  before I began caring about socks.
[58:14.360 --> 58:15.480]  It's one of life's great pleasures
[58:15.480 --> 58:17.720]  to have like really good socks and underwear.
[58:17.720 --> 58:18.840]  It is amazing.
[58:18.840 --> 58:21.920]  And, you know, I spend, you know, large parts of my life
[58:21.920 --> 58:23.400]  typically not even leaving my house
[58:23.400 --> 58:25.360]  and I just walk around wearing socks.
[58:25.360 --> 58:26.940]  It's the thing that's on my foot
[58:26.940 --> 58:28.400]  more than anything else in the world.
[58:28.400 --> 58:29.240]  Why not?
[58:29.240 --> 58:32.700]  It's really great stuff and it really is easy to buy.
[58:34.040 --> 58:35.240]  So I think it's great products.
[58:35.240 --> 58:37.000]  Literally, they're being worn right now.
[58:37.000 --> 58:38.440]  I didn't even know Marco was wearing them.
[58:38.440 --> 58:40.520]  I didn't run this by him before him, but there you go.
[58:40.520 --> 58:41.880]  It's literally, it's all,
[58:41.880 --> 58:44.100]  the underwear is all I wear anymore, period.
[58:44.100 --> 58:47.580]  And the shirts, I'm probably wearing one of their t-shirts
[58:47.580 --> 58:50.200]  in the summertime, nearly 100% of the time,
[58:50.200 --> 58:51.880]  and in the wintertime, maybe half the time.
[58:51.880 --> 58:54.800]  All right, if I could only keep one of their products,
[58:54.800 --> 58:56.200]  because there's a lot of places to buy socks.
[58:56.200 --> 58:57.040]  Even though their socks are nice.
[58:57.040 --> 58:59.440]  But to me, the t-shirts, the undershirts are the best.
[58:59.440 --> 59:00.640]  If I could only keep one,
[59:00.640 --> 59:02.260]  if you said you have to get rid of everything,
[59:02.260 --> 59:04.640]  it would be the V-neck white undershirts,
[59:04.640 --> 59:06.640]  which are so comfortable.
[59:06.640 --> 59:09.000]  And I realize this now as I think about it,
[59:09.000 --> 59:11.560]  I haven't ordered them in quite a while.
[59:11.560 --> 59:13.320]  So the ones I have, and they all look brand new.
[59:13.320 --> 59:14.200]  They hold up, yeah.
[59:14.200 --> 59:16.020]  Yeah, so I'm thinking about that right now.
[59:16.020 --> 59:18.000]  I can't remember the last time I bought new stuff there.
[59:18.000 --> 59:19.160]  I should actually go to their website
[59:19.160 --> 59:20.680]  and see if they have anything new.
[59:20.680 --> 59:23.280]  But the white V-neck undershirts,
[59:23.280 --> 59:24.640]  they hold up tremendously.
[59:24.640 --> 59:25.720]  Mine all look brand new.
[59:25.720 --> 59:28.760]  They hold their shape, really terrific stuff.
[59:28.760 --> 59:30.240]  So that's my very favorite product.
[59:30.240 --> 59:32.300]  Here's what you gotta do.
[59:32.300 --> 59:37.300]  You can get 20% off your next order with the code TALKSHOW.
[59:38.300 --> 59:43.300]  Know the, just TALKSHOW at the macweldon.com website.
[59:45.580 --> 59:47.420]  So there you go, macweldon.com.
[59:47.420 --> 59:50.940]  At checkout, the code is TALKSHOW,
[59:50.940 --> 59:54.100]  and you save 20% off your first order.
[59:54.100 --> 59:54.940]  I would use that code.
[59:54.940 --> 59:56.980]  I would load up if you need T-shirts and socks.
[59:56.980 --> 59:58.740]  Just load up, trust me.
[59:58.740 --> 01:00:01.100]  Get a bunch, save 20% on your first order.
[01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:02.420]  You'll thank me later.
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:04.140]  My thanks to Mac Weldon.
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:08.220]  Let's get into specifics about this machine.
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:09.780]  I can't really do a full review.
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:12.020]  I think I've had a, I forget when I got this.
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:15.260]  I think it's Friday.
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:17.580]  So I've probably, this is probably my seventh day
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:19.220]  of using this machine.
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:21.020]  I did something new with this machine
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:23.940]  that I haven't done before out of what I think
[01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:25.780]  is an irrational fear.
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:30.000]  But for all of my years of testing MacBooks and stuff,
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.160]  I never used migration assistant to move stuff
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.060]  from an old machine.
[01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:36.380]  Nope, because.
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:37.220]  How do you do it?
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:38.300]  Do you set up new every time?
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:41.340]  Yeah, I have like this whole checklist in an Apple.
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:45.860]  So I have an Apple Note with what to do with a new Mac.
[01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:50.020]  And you get the new Mac, and I'd set it up factory refresh,
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:52.420]  and I'd sign in to iCloud.
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:54.500]  And so once I'm signed into iCloud,
[01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:58.580]  and I'd go through the do you want to send developer
[01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:00.220]  information, all the things you got to do.
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:01.780]  And you want to turn on Siri, you
[01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:03.540]  want to set up touch ID, blah, blah, blah.
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:05.380]  OK, and then it spins for a little bit.
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:08.100]  And then boom, you're at a default desktop.
[01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:10.060]  Right away, because you're signed into iCloud,
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:11.420]  your notes start filing in.
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:14.020]  And then I would go to Apple Notes, find that note,
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:16.100]  and start going through the list of things
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:19.580]  to install side by side.
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:22.140]  And I think that's partly explains
[01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:25.380]  why I hate getting a new Mac, because it's a lot of work.
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:27.900]  So this time, I was like, well, this is going to be great.
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:31.580]  I'm going to be using, going to Marco's for a couple of days
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:34.340]  next week, but I don't have a lot of time.
[01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:36.100]  So why don't I try migration assistant?
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:37.800]  If I don't like it, I can wipe it clean.
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.540]  So I tried migration assistant.
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.380]  And I have to say, hey, I'm pretty dumb for not
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:42.340]  having used it before.
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:46.380]  It's kind of amazing how much stuff moved over.
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:47.180]  Not everything.
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:49.100]  One thing that I noticed, or at least for me,
[01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:50.840]  I don't know if this is by design or not,
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.940]  but nothing that's a login item moved over.
[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:54.580]  Like when it was done, it took like,
[01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:56.580]  and I just did it over Wi-Fi at home.
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:59.260]  And it took about four hours with the two machines
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:01.020]  side by side.
[01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:02.940]  And when it was done and I logged in,
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:09.260]  this looks like almost identical to my personal 13-inch MacBook
[01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:11.940]  Pro, just on a 15-inch display.
[01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:16.020]  And almost all of my apps moved over.
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:17.300]  At least one of them when I first
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.660]  did Fantastical for some reason, when it went to launch,
[01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:20.980]  said this app is damaged.
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:22.780]  Move it to the trash and redownload
[01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:24.220]  from the app store, which I did.
[01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:27.420]  And then it worked.
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:28.780]  I don't know what happened there.
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:30.500]  The only thing I noticed was that nothing
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.480]  that was a login item, the things
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.900]  that I have that launch automatically when I log in,
[01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:36.120]  none of them came over.
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.620]  I don't know if that's a security.
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:38.740]  I don't know if that's a bug or if it's
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:40.620]  like a security thing or something.
[01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:43.540]  Could it be like a cruft reducer over time
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:45.300]  that those things get all crazy?
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:48.260]  One of the things that moved over that I'm blown away by
[01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:52.660]  is a bunch of Perl modules that I have installed,
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:56.860]  non-standard Perl modules from the CPAN archive.
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:58.580]  I couldn't believe that they moved over.
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:00.820]  I've got some services that do things automatically,
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:03.180]  and some of them I know rely upon modules
[01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.940]  you have to download.
[01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:06.780]  And I don't do the thing like, Syracuse,
[01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:09.660]  if he's listening to this episode, is going to cringe.
[01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:12.860]  I don't do the thing that people, Perl experts,
[01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:17.700]  recommend, which is leave system Perl as it is,
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:20.420]  and use Homebrew or something to install
[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:23.700]  your own personal version, a second version of Perl,
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.660]  or any other open source scripting language
[01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:26.540]  that you use.
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:28.460]  Install your own and any kind of custom stuff
[01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:31.500]  you want to set up, do it there, and leave system Perl alone.
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.140]  I don't do that.
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:35.180]  I just install CPAN levels in the system.
[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:38.940]  But maybe, I don't even remember,
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:42.900]  maybe when I set up my personal MacBook years ago,
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:47.060]  I did the thing where when I install CPAN modules
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:50.500]  at the terminal, they are still being put somewhere
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:54.060]  in a dot directory in my home folder.
[01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:55.860]  And so that migration assistant, when
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:58.180]  it moved over my whole home folder,
[01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:03.380]  it included all those weird Unix-y dot whatever
[01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:06.460]  in quote unquote invisible directories.
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:07.020]  I don't know.
[01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:08.900]  I mean, I don't think it moves over things
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:10.940]  that are in user local or anything like that.
[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:12.020]  Right.
[01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:15.580]  I will say, I have had really good luck with migration
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:16.620]  assistant before.
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:18.240]  The only thing is, if you try to do it
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:21.020]  over Wi-Fi or over the network, it's usually terrible.
[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:23.580]  But if you can find a way to do it over a cable in some way,
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:27.340]  like if you must wire Ethernet, but even better than that
[01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:29.980]  is Thunderbolt to target disk mode.
[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:33.300]  If you can do that, it's usually pretty reasonable
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:35.700]  and time-wise, it usually finishes without problems.
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.260]  It's pretty good.
[01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:38.860]  I've had very few failures.
[01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:40.980]  It did move over user local bin.
[01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:41.780]  That's interesting.
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:44.260]  Because I have not installed Homebrew on this machine,
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:48.140]  and I just typed which brew, and it says user local bin brew.
[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:49.660]  So it did move over that.
[01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:50.540]  It's amazing.
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:53.980]  So yeah, so maybe it moves over user local, but just not user.
[01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.140]  So that way, maybe that's why you're
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:58.420]  supposed to use your local automatic for stuff like that.
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:04:59.820]  So I don't know if this is a recent thing.
[01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:02.300]  I don't know if I've been missing out on this for years.
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:04.140]  I don't know if there, but whoever
[01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:08.660]  inside Apple is responsible for migration assistant moving
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:12.580]  over so much of this stuff, I thank you sincerely,
[01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:16.540]  because I really spent almost no time whatsoever configuring
[01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:18.740]  this machine before leaving for this trip.
[01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:21.900]  And it's done everything I've needed to.
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:25.580]  I brought my personal MacBook Pro as a backup
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:27.940]  just in case I got here and I needed it for some reason
[01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:29.540]  and I haven't needed it for anything.
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:30.580]  It's really remarkable.
[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:34.500]  So anybody else out there with my same irrational fear
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:37.180]  that migration assistant is going to leave me
[01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:40.220]  with more work to do than doing it all by hand,
[01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:41.260]  give it a try next time.
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:42.740]  I mean, the worst that happens is you just
[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:45.780]  wipe it and start over, but I was blown away.
[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:48.140]  Yeah, I think a lot of that comes from,
[01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:49.980]  because I've used migration assistant for years,
[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:52.740]  and I've only done a very small number
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:55.380]  of clean installs on my Mac ever.
[01:05:55.380 --> 01:06:00.300]  It's probably less than four in the 12 years
[01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:03.220]  or 14 years I've been using Macs full time.
[01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:05.860]  And so it almost always means migration assistant
[01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:07.740]  to move stuff, and it's great.
[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:10.700]  I think a lot of that fear comes from Windows switchers
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:14.100]  like me, because Windows always had upgrade install
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:16.940]  versus clean install, and the upgrades and migrations
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:19.940]  for Windows were, at least back when I was using Windows,
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:22.660]  horrible, incredibly unreliable.
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:24.940]  It was almost always a bad idea to do anything
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.180]  but a clean install.
[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:28.380]  Yeah, but Windows even had, or still has,
[01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:30.140]  I don't even know, but had the reputation
[01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:31.900]  that even if you're not moving to a new machine,
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:36.300]  your existing installation is going to dissolve over time.
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:39.740]  Oh yeah, as just part of a thing that computer geeks
[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:41.660]  had to do, and probably still do,
[01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:45.140]  I had to reformat and start my Windows installation clean
[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:47.020]  I think about every year or so.
[01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:49.060]  Right, so why would you move an installation
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:51.340]  to a new machine when you're going to have to reinstall
[01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:52.620]  on your regular machine anyway?
[01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:54.580]  Exactly, it was like recreation.
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:56.440]  You defrag your disk, and then every once a year
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:58.900]  you reformat and reinstall Windows for fun.
[01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:00.300]  I don't have any experience with Windows.
[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:03.900]  I mean, I've used Windows, seriously,
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:06.340]  well over a decade ago now, so it's ancient,
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:09.620]  but even back then I never was a regular Windows user,
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:11.660]  never owned a Windows machine.
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.800]  I just think, I think it's based on the fact
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:17.100]  that maybe even going back to the classic Mac OS era,
[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:19.740]  the migration assistant didn't work well,
[01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:21.820]  or wasn't good enough for me.
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:26.140]  I don't think it's completely without some experience
[01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:28.420]  trying Apple's, okay, you have a new Mac,
[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:30.220]  let's copy stuff from your old Mac.
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:32.180]  I don't know if they always called it migration assistant,
[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:34.100]  but at some point I tried it,
[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:35.980]  but literally it might be 15, 20 years ago,
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:39.180]  and it might even be back in the classic era,
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:42.580]  and it just was completely unsatisfactory.
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:44.680]  Yeah, I mean, my experience with it has been basically
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:47.100]  like if you want a clean install,
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:48.880]  just like for organizational purposes,
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:51.460]  or to try out new ways of doing things, or whatever,
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:52.780]  go for it, that's fine.
[01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:54.940]  But migration assistant is so good
[01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:56.900]  that you don't need to really ever do that.
[01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:59.460]  It's totally optional, if you don't want a clean install,
[01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:01.220]  you never have to do one.
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:03.260]  Yeah, and you know what, I'm thinking about it.
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:06.060]  Even things like my shell, so like I'm,
[01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:09.700]  I've never really learned a bash in a,
[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:12.420]  I can use it, but I'm not a bash expert,
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:17.420]  I never had, like a super complicated bash RC file.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:22.100]  So I switched to fish at some point in the last year,
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.580]  and I find it to be very fun,
[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:27.020]  and I love that it doesn't have all these
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.200]  50-year-old Unix conventions.
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:33.860]  And that, it's my default shell on this machine.
[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:37.140]  So like without me doing it, when I open terminal,
[01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:39.940]  it still is the same default as the last machine.
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:42.420]  So somewhere within Apple, somebody cares
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:45.180]  about the 1% of Mac users who do things
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:47.420]  like install stuff in user local bin.
[01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:49.700]  Yeah, I bet it's actually well less than 1%.
[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:54.100]  Right, I'll bet it is, but because I'll bet that 1%
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:56.900]  includes the sort of people who are engineers
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:58.980]  on the migration assistant team.
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:08:59.800]  Right, yeah.
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.900]  There's a high likelihood, somehow somebody,
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:04.140]  somebody did the work for that, and I appreciate it.
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.960]  It's also, you know, it's a lot of, you know, pros.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:07.500]  Like a lot of pros are developers.
[01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:08.580]  A lot of developers put their,
[01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:11.060]  especially web developers put even more stuff there,
[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:13.340]  and that's a pretty big market for the MacBook Pro,
[01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:16.940]  so, and Macs in general, so that's actually, you know,
[01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:18.080]  that's something that they should do.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.380]  So yeah, I'm glad they do.
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:22.260]  Other than that, I love the machine.
[01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:25.860]  Right now, it's still, it has dropped below 100%.
[01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:29.580]  We're at 98% battery life.
[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:31.180]  It is thrilling.
[01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:34.180]  It is absolutely cool to the touch,
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:36.900]  even right at the base of the display
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:38.220]  where it gets hot faster.
[01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:41.360]  It runs very cool when you're doing minimal work.
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:43.340]  The display is lovely.
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:47.100]  True Tone works exactly as I expected it to,
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.260]  which is I've already forgotten it's there,
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:52.700]  but then when I look, like my son brought his laptop
[01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:54.340]  on vacation, when I look at his screen
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:55.980]  in certain lighting conditions here,
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:59.060]  I'm like, oh my God, that looks so terrible.
[01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:02.620]  So I'm already ruined by True Tone.
[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:04.120]  That's probably gonna be the single hardest thing
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.380]  about going back to my machine from this,
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:07.620]  and probably the single thing
[01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:09.720]  that might tempt me to update.
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:11.020]  Yeah, I mean, why go back?
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:12.720]  Because now you know Migration Assistant works.
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.380]  Now you're gonna be buying every laptop.
[01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:15.220]  I know, I know.
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:16.620]  Now I might get on like an iPhone
[01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:18.100]  like year over year system.
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:20.420]  You know, with the iPhone, I'm still running.
[01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:23.260]  My iPhone right here in front of me
[01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:27.460]  has been updated ever since the original iPhone
[01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:29.680]  10 years ago, or I guess 11 years ago
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:32.080]  at this point, right, in 2007.
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:34.580]  So like starting with my original iPhone in 2007,
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:37.100]  I've bought a new iPhone for myself every year,
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:41.760]  and every time I have updated from what it was,
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:47.500]  which is kind of amazing in terms of old school experience.
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:49.540]  Even on the Mac side, it just didn't seem like
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:51.840]  that was a good idea to just keep buying new things
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:56.300]  and keeping a system going from 11 years ago.
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:58.460]  Yeah, although I think I kept my first installation
[01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:00.140]  going for like seven or eight years.
[01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:01.320]  It was something crazy.
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.220]  But, and with iPhones, it makes more sense,
[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:04.840]  because with iPhones, you get a lot more
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:06.320]  year over year change.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.260]  And even though that's in some ways,
[01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:09.580]  and like some years that kind of is
[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:11.480]  a little bit slower than others in recent times,
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:13.500]  it's still way more year over year change
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:14.940]  than you get on the Mac side.
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:19.940]  You know, like if you have a 2016 MacBook Pro,
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:23.620]  then the 2018s, it's two more years.
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:26.220]  On the iPhone, that would be a really big, nice jump.
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:31.220]  On the Mac, the 2018s are gonna be 50% better
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:34.160]  at most on certain tasks, and in some ways,
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:36.500]  on most tasks, not nearly that much better.
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.460]  Like it'll be a little bit better, a little bit nicer,
[01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:40.560]  but largely the same experience.
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:45.320]  So single thing I like most is the display,
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:46.560]  because it has true tone.
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:49.920]  The single thing I like least is the keyboard,
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:53.080]  because it just feels weird.
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:56.400]  I can't get used, I can, like I don't hate it.
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.080]  And I remember from when I tested,
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:01.680]  when these MacBook Pros first came out in 2016,
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:06.160]  November 2016, I got Apple, it sent me like three of them.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:10.060]  I got like the Escape, I got a 13 inch with touch bar,
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:11.800]  and then a 15 inch with touch bar,
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:17.240]  which was discombobulating to my simple mind.
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:19.440]  How do I test three laptops at once?
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:20.280]  When they were staggered,
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.080]  like everyone got the Escape first to review.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.600]  Because the touch bar ones weren't ready
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.520]  even for reviewers when they announced it.
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:26.360]  And then the touch bar came out
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:28.360]  like a couple of weeks later, right, for reviewers?
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.260]  But because there were three of them,
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:33.720]  I spent longer than usual using it.
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:37.320]  And I remember then, I was like, this is unfamiliar.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:40.840]  And I don't like the keyboard feel-wise.
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:41.920]  And I kinda got used to it.
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:44.000]  And I think I'm sure I would get used to this.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:44.840]  I'm sure I would.
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:48.660]  But one week in, my fingers still feel
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:51.200]  like they're in a foreign country or something.
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:54.800]  Like I'm driving on the wrong side of the road.
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:55.760]  It doesn't feel right.
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:00.760]  But there are other people here who have similar keyboards.
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:04.360]  And in terms of the volume, this issue with,
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:07.160]  hey, this one's quieter because of the silicone membrane
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:08.000]  that they've added.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.820]  There is no doubt in my mind that it's quieter.
[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:11.800]  It's quieter from my memory
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:14.640]  of using the keyboards in late 2016.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:19.440]  I know Joanna Stern and I did a podcast at some point
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:22.860]  where she really hated the noise that those keyboards made.
[01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:23.700]  I can't wait to talk to her.
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:24.680]  It was really bad.
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:25.520]  It was.
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.440]  It was like tapping on an upside-down bucket.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:30.480]  Like it was so just like cheap and crappy sounding.
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:34.360]  And keep in mind, they did change it in 2017 also.
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:35.200]  Yeah.
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:38.080]  Not anything, but the 2017s were a little bit quieter.
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.680]  I didn't get one of those to test,
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:44.680]  but I did do the typical Apple podcaster thing,
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.720]  which is wander into an Apple store
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:49.200]  and just start typing on one.
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:50.040]  Yeah, we're very good at that.
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.920]  Right, and it's weird because I go in
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:53.520]  and I realize I look like a crazy person
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:55.960]  because I'm not looking at the display.
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:58.480]  I'm like, you know, so that I can concentrate
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:00.680]  on what it sounds and feels like.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:02.600]  I'm just sort of staring into space.
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:03.840]  Like staring straight ahead.
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.360]  Yeah, you know, because it's like,
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.720]  well, I'm just looking at one of the white spaces
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:13.240]  in the Apple store, you know, into the Johnny Eye void
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.760]  where my visual field isn't really,
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:19.060]  I'm just, it's all about the feel and the listening.
[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:20.560]  But it was, that was a subtle change.
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.520]  Whereas this is clearly a new keyboard
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:24.640]  and I think it's better.
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.080]  I definitely do.
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:29.080]  I think it's quieter and I think it even feels better.
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:34.080]  So, you know, one of my questions was with this silicone
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.120]  thing, everybody, of course, you know,
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:38.720]  there's this whole thing about the egress, you know,
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:42.480]  that little pieces of dust would get into your keyboard.
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:44.640]  You know, this is one of the biggest Apple scandals
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:45.920]  of the last year.
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.400]  Little bit of dust gets in your keyboard
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.320]  and all of a sudden one of the keys gets stuck
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:52.400]  and Apple, you know, it's, to me, embarrassing.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.140]  I mean, everybody knows this is embarrassing
[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:57.240]  that Apple even has commissioned, you know,
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:00.720]  a nice Apple style professional illustrators
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:06.720]  to draw a diagram of the exact 43 degree angle
[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:10.140]  you should hold the MacBook with while you spray it
[01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:14.420]  with a can of compressed air, right?
[01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:16.400]  Like the fact that this wasn't just like
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:19.160]  a word of mouth thing, like you go in the Apple store
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.920]  and they tell, you know, like zapping PRAM
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:22.960]  or something like that, all these, you know,
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:26.280]  little bits of tech support advice that float around
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:28.280]  and it's like, oh yeah, just try a can of air or whatever.
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:30.120]  Like Apple had to actually like make it
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:32.840]  like a major illustrated support document.
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:36.480]  The fear that, you know, common sense would say,
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:39.320]  well, what if they added this silicone layer
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:43.960]  specifically to combat this egress thing
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.360]  that was getting these keys stuck
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:49.080]  and was turning into a support and publicity nightmare
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:50.080]  for the company?
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:55.080]  Surely they've spent way more money than they wanted to
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:59.080]  on repairing these keyboards.
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:03.200]  And publicity wise, it's probably even more of an expense.
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:05.480]  It's one of the worst cases of bad publicity
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.120]  that they've had in recent years.
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.340]  Well, what if they added this silicone layer
[01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:12.480]  to keep out the dust and keep the keyboard working,
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:15.480]  but what if it makes the keyboard worse?
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:17.120]  Right, I mean, that was a, you know,
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.800]  and I still haven't spent meaningful time
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.200]  with one yet, because mine's not here yet,
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:25.200]  but like the keyboard is already just like barely
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.720]  good enough feeling for most people.
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:32.020]  Most people either like it or don't care,
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:34.940]  but it's dealing with such tiny tolerances
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:37.560]  of like these keys barely move.
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:40.220]  It barely feels like you're pushing something down.
[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:41.920]  Like if they reduce that,
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:44.120]  there's not a lot of room to reduce that.
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:47.680]  And so certainly a big risk of this is that it's, you know,
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:49.640]  that it makes it feel worse at the expense
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:50.800]  of making it more durable.
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:52.080]  So you're saying you don't think it feels worse?
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:55.040]  No, I think it feels better.
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:58.640]  I think it feels better than the ones without the membrane.
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:16:59.880]  So there's three generations.
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:01.480]  There's the first generation.
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:05.200]  I think that that includes the MacBook One,
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.080]  or maybe they're only talking about MacBook Pro.
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:10.520]  The MacBook One, well, so the 2015 MacBook One
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:12.920]  had a version of this keyboard that basically,
[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:15.600]  like they all have the exact same travel,
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:19.200]  but the very first one had like no kickback on the keys.
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:20.960]  And so it felt even worse than these.
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:22.080]  Yeah, it felt like dead.
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:26.240]  Yeah, the 2016, when they put the MacBook Pro generation
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:28.600]  with this keyboard, it added this big,
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:30.200]  strong kickback feeling,
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:32.600]  which also made that horrible noise.
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:35.560]  But it did make it feel less crappy.
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:37.040]  Well, what I'm saying, what I'm questioning
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:38.880]  is Apple describes this keyboard,
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:42.520]  this one with the silicone layer, as third generation.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:45.920]  But are they only counting MacBook Pro keyboards,
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:48.360]  as in 2016 was first generation?
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:50.240]  When they introduced 2016s,
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:52.560]  they called this the second generation butterfly keyboard.
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.640]  The first generation one, by their naming,
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:56.960]  was the one in the 2015 MacBook.
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:00.040]  Then the second generation is technically 2016
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:02.480]  and 2017 MacBook Pros, even though they're different.
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.400]  And then third generation is the 2018 one.
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:07.520]  Right, so to go to software numbering lingo,
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:12.480]  it would be like the 1.0 was the 2015 MacBook One,
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:15.000]  2.0 was 2016 MacBook Pros,
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.980]  2.1 was the 2017 MacBook Pros,
[01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:19.240]  and this is 3.0.
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:20.080]  Yeah.
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.600]  Yeah, I like this one better.
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.800]  There's no question in my mind, one weekend,
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:25.160]  I like it better.
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:30.160]  And the things that I don't like are endemic to it.
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:34.580]  I don't like the less travel.
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:38.660]  But that might just be that I'm not used to it yet.
[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:41.100]  I'm willing to concede that if given enough time with it
[01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:43.560]  as my main machine, I might grow to appreciate it.
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:46.400]  Because I remember thinking the same thing
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:49.080]  every single time Apple makes their machines thinner,
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:51.120]  every single time they radically change
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:53.620]  their laptop keyboards, I don't like it.
[01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:55.000]  Because there's always less travel,
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.280]  because they're always making them thinner,
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:57.800]  and so they have to reduce the travel
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:01.240]  because you have to reduce the travel on the keyboard
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:02.680]  to make the machine thicker.
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:07.240]  It's just simple three-dimensional spatial reality.
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.880]  In terms of feel, I still like the way
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:15.720]  like a 15-year-old PowerBook feels,
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:17.480]  because it's got some click.
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:20.440]  But I'm realistic.
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:23.200]  I don't expect a Apple-extended keyboard
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:26.000]  to mechanical keyboard on a laptop.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.560]  I realize it's physically impossible,
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:28.720]  so I realize there's less travel.
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:29.560]  And every time they take it.
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:30.640]  You would totally buy it if there was.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:31.640]  Oh, yeah, definitely.
[01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:35.440]  So the travel, the travel is the travel.
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:37.240]  There's nothing they can do about it.
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:40.240]  I find, well, all right.
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:42.360]  Okay, I'll let that go for this.
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:43.780]  Right, well, there's nothing they could do
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:45.440]  other than to make the machines thicker.
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:46.280]  In theory.
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:48.480]  Maybe not.
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:49.600]  Honestly, maybe not.
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:51.080]  Maybe they could just,
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:53.400]  because there are a lot of PC laptops
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:57.840]  that have a similar overall thinness and profile
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:01.440]  where it has more traditional style keyboard.
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:02.680]  Yeah, I guess I shouldn't say that.
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:06.240]  And I also know that there are people who prefer this.
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:08.280]  Oh, yeah, a good amount of them, actually.
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.840]  A good amount of people genuinely prefer it.
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:12.500]  The thing that I find hard to get used to,
[01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:14.280]  and I remember this from 2016, too,
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:17.120]  is that the key caps are physically bigger.
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:22.120]  So the keys are bigger and there's less space between keys.
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.160]  The keyboard itself isn't bigger.
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:26.480]  They've just reduced space between keys
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:29.760]  and used that extra space to make the keys bigger.
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:32.920]  And for some reason, even though it shouldn't,
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:34.480]  because the center of every key
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:36.020]  is still in the same position,
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:40.780]  it feels to me like I have to spread my fingers wider.
[01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:43.600]  And my hands feel weird right now
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:45.800]  because before we started recording the show,
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.960]  I was writing a bunch of emails
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.580]  and posting a few things to Daring Fireball,
[01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:51.920]  so I was typing, and my fingers feel like
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:55.680]  I've spread them out, webbed out my fingers.
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:57.600]  They just feel a little sore like that.
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:58.920]  And that doesn't make any sense
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.120]  because the center of every key
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.720]  is still the same distance apart.
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:05.420]  And I think it's something that I would clearly get used to.
[01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:07.120]  If I used this for a month
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:10.040]  and then went back to my 2014 MacBook Pro,
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:10.880]  I would think, oh my God,
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:13.180]  why are these keys so close to each other?
[01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:16.560]  So I've gone back and forth with this generation of laptops.
[01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:21.840]  That's a euphemistic way of describing your history.
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:23.400]  Understatement, maybe.
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.320]  So when I've spent meaningful time with them,
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:26.920]  I have gotten used to the travel.
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:30.100]  I've never liked it, but I've gotten used to it.
[01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:33.300]  What gets me is the arrow key layout
[01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:36.400]  not having the gaps above the left and right arrow keys.
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:40.280]  So a combination of that and what you just described
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:43.640]  of the margin between the keys being thinner, basically,
[01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:45.920]  that it makes it for me, for my hands,
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:49.640]  it makes it harder for me to orient myself by feel
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:50.480]  on the keyboard.
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:55.400]  It feels closer to just a flat piece of glass.
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.080]  The arrow key thing I'll never get used to.
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:02.040]  And it seems like this was not a temporary blip
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:05.120]  on Apple's design tastes.
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:08.900]  They're all in on full-size left and right arrow keys
[01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:11.320]  and half-size up-down keys.
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:15.600]  But not having that upside-down T shape to orient by feel,
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:16.880]  I don't know that I'll ever get used to it.
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:17.720]  I'm actually-
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:19.060]  Yeah, I make tons of mistakes on that.
[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:21.880]  I am literally thinking, I swear to God,
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:25.140]  I am thinking, even if this were my machine that I owned,
[01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:26.420]  I might do it.
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:29.240]  But I'm seriously thinking about making
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:33.160]  half-height strips of gaff tape
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:35.680]  and putting them on the bottom of the left and right keys.
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:36.520]  I really am.
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:38.240]  That's not a bad idea.
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:39.080]  That's-
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:39.900]  Gaff tape was-
[01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:40.740]  Especially on a review unit.
[01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:42.520]  Gaff tape is how I solved my problem
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:46.960]  with the orientation of the Apple TV remote,
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:49.760]  is I just put a belt of gaff tape
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:54.760]  around the bottom part of the Apple TV remote.
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:57.280]  And then I could run my fingers along the side.
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:58.280]  And when I feel the tape,
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:22:59.880]  I know which way it goes in the dark
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:01.400]  or without looking at it.
[01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:04.040]  And I kind of feel, gaff tape,
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:05.720]  moral of the man introduced me to gaff tape.
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:08.000]  Gaff tape is one of the most amazing things.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.560]  Anybody out there who doesn't have
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:11.560]  a roll of gaff tape in the house,
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.560]  go out, just go to Amazon and buy one right now.
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:14.400]  You'll thank me later.
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:15.320]  It is the most-
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.380]  It's the most amazing tape in the world.
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:21.160]  The name comes, I believe, from the movie industry.
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:24.560]  Gaffers are, I think, the people who adjust the lights
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:27.720]  and stuff like that, like the lighting stands.
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:29.620]  And so they use this black tape.
[01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:31.160]  Once they get the light in the right position,
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:34.640]  they'll tape it down on the set so that it can't move.
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:38.160]  But gaff tape, unlike something like duct tape
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:39.880]  that's supposed to be permanent,
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:43.040]  when you peel, gaff tape is very strong and it holds.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:43.880]  It's cloth-like and feels.
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:45.000]  And it is cloth-like.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.120]  And so you can rip it perfectly straight.
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:47.960]  You can rip it by hand.
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:48.800]  You don't need scissors.
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:49.840]  Right, you don't need scissors.
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:50.920]  You rip it straight.
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:53.920]  It's easy to rip.
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:56.320]  And it holds as much as you want.
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:57.480]  But then when you unpeel it,
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:00.700]  there's almost no residue or no residue.
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:04.120]  So my concern on putting it under the arrow keys
[01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:05.520]  is that you might get some on the screen.
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:07.040]  Right, exactly, I would have.
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:09.440]  But it would be, well, it would kind of be
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:10.760]  in the middle of the screen.
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:12.880]  So there'd be, that's exactly my thought,
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:14.840]  because it would absorb finger oil,
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:17.640]  and then there'd be two little oily spots on the screen.
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.880]  But I clean my screen regularly
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:23.000]  because I'm very sensitive to,
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.320]  I'm actually appalled at how many tiny little smudges
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:28.000]  I've gotten on this machine in the last week.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:28.840]  Have you ever been one of those people
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.640]  who has those microfiber cloths
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.480]  that you put over the keyboard when you close the laptop?
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:34.000]  I used to use one of those.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.600]  I forget when I stopped.
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:40.000]  But it used to be, I forget what generation of,
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.620]  it was probably in the PowerBook era.
[01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:44.240]  But up until a certain point in the PowerBook era,
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.760]  it was inevitable that you would get
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:50.640]  keyboard-shaped marks on the display.
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:51.600]  Well, no, see, that was.
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:52.800]  Just by closing the display.
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:53.920]  It wasn't inevitable.
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:57.480]  Because, I just talked to this on ETP last night.
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:00.680]  So if you put it in a bag
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:02.760]  where there was something on top of it
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:05.400]  where you'd carry it so that it would compress it slightly,
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:08.420]  if there was any pressure applied to that top screen lid,
[01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:10.280]  it would contact the keyboard.
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:15.080]  But if there was no pressure squeezing it closed more,
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:15.920]  it wouldn't touch.
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:18.240]  Because I had a G4 aluminum PowerBook.
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:19.120]  And I heard about this.
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:21.680]  And so I basically constantly arranged my bags
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:24.080]  such that it would never get pressed on.
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:25.640]  And I never had those marks.
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:26.760]  And everyone else I knew had them.
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:27.840]  And mine was perfect.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:28.660]  I didn't know about that.
[01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:30.700]  But back in that era, I didn't worry about it
[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:32.960]  because I just used the microfiber cloth
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:36.080]  that covered the keyboard every time I shut the device.
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:37.720]  I guess I kinda knew that.
[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:40.320]  Because I guess I only used that when I put it in a bag.
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:42.180]  I guess in two, I had never really thought
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:43.020]  about it consciously.
[01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:45.440]  But if I was only closing it to keep it on a desk,
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:46.960]  just closing it for privacy reasons
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:50.660]  or just to shut it down, I wouldn't do it every time.
[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:54.680]  I would only use that go-between-the-keyboard-in-the-screen
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:56.640]  rag, because that's basic.
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:59.240]  We get fancy at all microfiber cloths.
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:00.080]  It was a rag.
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.720]  Yeah, it's a really thin rag.
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:03.800]  It was a nice rag, a very nice rag.
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:05.440]  Probably a very expensive little nice rag.
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:06.400]  Right.
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:07.840]  No, I always want to be one of those people.
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:10.980]  I never actually have the dedication to the idea
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:12.200]  to actually do it.
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:15.320]  But I always kinda envy how good people's computers
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.740]  end up looking when they are those people.
[01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:22.020]  But so I'm curious, so the arrow key thing aside,
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:25.200]  as the keyboard picky individual that you are,
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:29.320]  would you ever, would you be okay with this keyboard
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:32.520]  long-term, like basically where we are now in the lineup,
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:34.240]  it looks like this is, you're kinda stuck
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:35.080]  with this forever now.
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:36.440]  Yeah, I could live with it.
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:37.720]  And there are parts that I like.
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:41.560]  I genuinely admire and appreciate at a mechanical level
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:43.960]  and the way it feels, the way that with these
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:47.680]  butterfly switches, no matter where on the key you press,
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:52.000]  the entire key moves down completely flat, right?
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:57.480]  That's new, and no other laptop keyboard I've ever seen
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:58.320]  does that.
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:00.720]  And when I do use this for a while and go back
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:03.720]  to my previous generation keyboard,
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:07.000]  I still am not used enough to this that I don't appreciate
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.280]  the other one overall, but I'm blown away
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:12.280]  at how wiggly the previous generation keyboard feels.
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:14.160]  It's like I cannot believe how these keys wiggle
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:15.920]  on an Apple laptop.
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:18.660]  See, I can see that and I can feel that,
[01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:19.920]  but to me I just don't care at all.
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:20.880]  Like it's like they solved a problem
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:22.680]  that I would never have cared about.
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:25.640]  But I'm also here, it's like the arrow key thing to me,
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:27.960]  like it's the shape of those arrow keys
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:30.040]  not being full height, like it's unnecessary
[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:30.860]  as far as I can tell.
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:32.240]  Like I don't think there's any structural reason
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:33.600]  why they can't have more metal there
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:35.020]  to make that just the T shape.
[01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:37.320]  It seems like it's purely an aesthetic choice.
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:42.320]  And honestly, that would make me like 50% happier
[01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:44.480]  with this keyboard if they just returned
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:46.000]  the inverted T shape to the arrow keys.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.880]  Absolutely, if there's one thing I could change
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:51.500]  on the keyboard, it would be the upside down T.
[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:53.340]  Even the touch bar, I don't really mind the touch bar
[01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:54.720]  as much as, I don't really like it.
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:57.760]  I can't say I use it a lot, but I've never owned one
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.880]  on my personal machine and really gotten into a workflow
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:03.640]  with it, but I don't use function keys much either.
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:05.300]  Once I remapped escape to caps lock
[01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:06.600]  on all my keyboards everywhere,
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.160]  which took about a week to get used to,
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:09.440]  the touch bar stopped bothering me.
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:13.440]  I still don't want it, but I'm gonna have it now
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:15.360]  and I know that it'll be fine.
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:19.920]  Yeah, I don't know, I guess I could think about that.
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:21.000]  It's really, it's not that bad.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:21.840]  How did you do that?
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:23.200]  Do you do that in a system preferences?
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:25.120]  Yeah, it's in the modifier keys window.
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:27.060]  So you would never know because you use Apple keyboards.
[01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:29.760]  But if you ever wanna use a PC keyboard on a Mac,
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:32.840]  you have to usually swap command and option on one of them
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.720]  because I can use the Windows key.
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:37.720]  When I plug my extended keyboard too into a new machine,
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:40.420]  I don't have to switch anything, but I have to identify it
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:43.420]  in the way that they're like, I don't know what this is.
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:46.520]  Type the key next to the left shift key and Z.
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:48.000]  And they're like, oh, okay, I got it.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:48.920]  All right, I see where I am.
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:49.760]  No, this is different.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:52.120]  Like PC keyboards, basically they use the Windows key
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:54.800]  to be what command is on the key code map.
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:55.800]  So you gotta switch those.
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:57.640]  But in that same window in system preferences,
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:01.920]  keyboard modifier keys, you can set caps lock to be escape.
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:03.420]  See, what I would be tempted to wanna do,
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:04.840]  and I'll bet it doesn't support it,
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:09.560]  as I would be tempted to turn the back tick key to escape
[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:13.880]  and turn caps lock into the back tick tilde key.
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:16.680]  Because I almost never type backs lock or tilde,
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:20.180]  but my instinct to go top left for escape
[01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:21.760]  is impossible to override.
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:23.200]  I think it would take me forever
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:25.500]  to get used to caps lock as escape.
[01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:26.340]  But turning.
[01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:27.160]  Honestly, try it.
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:28.000]  It's super fast.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:28.960]  Because one thing that's great about it
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:31.000]  is that you can hit it with your pinky.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.840]  Like you don't have to move up the home row to hit escape.
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:34.760]  So it's like if you're like quickly dismissing a dialogue
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:35.880]  or something, it's really nice.
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:37.320]  Right, well that's like those people who,
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:39.840]  the people who are used to the old Unix convention
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:42.800]  of where caps lock is, making that the control key.
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:43.920]  Yeah, exactly, same reason.
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:47.960]  And the way that all the, there's a whole slew of navigate,
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:49.760]  you know, move the insertion point or cursor
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:51.720]  or whatever you wanna call it with control, whatever.
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:54.640]  You know, that having it just one little thing away
[01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:56.800]  from the A key for your pinky is super convenient.
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:57.640]  Yeah.
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.480]  Yeah, I can't believe I'm thinking about
[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:03.440]  solving a problem on it.
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:06.400]  This is literally like, what, like a $5,000 laptop?
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:07.240]  Because it does.
[01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:08.740]  I mean, look, if you're gonna try the tape trick,
[01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:10.240]  try it on Apple's laptop, not yours.
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:12.960]  The machine that they sent me is the Core i9
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:16.120]  with the fastest processor, 32 gigs of RAM.
[01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:19.360]  And the only thing that's not tippity top, tip top shape
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:22.480]  is they gave me a measly two gigabyte.
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:23.320]  Two terabyte.
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:26.720]  Two terabyte SSD, not the four terabyte SSD.
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:30.120]  Only the $2,000 one instead of the $4,000 one.
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:33.280]  Right, that's the only thing missing from this.
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:34.200]  Here's my rationale for this.
[01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:36.400]  Number one, Apple won't care.
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:40.520]  Number two, I'm guessing when they get a review unit back,
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:42.760]  they probably treat it the same way it's issued a return,
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:44.720]  which means it's sent for refurbishment.
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:45.560]  No.
[01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:46.380]  No?
[01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:48.480]  No, well, I don't know this.
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:50.800]  I can't verify it because I haven't seen it.
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:55.240]  But I believe for, I don't know if it's tax purposes,
[01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:56.800]  I don't know if it's accounting purposes,
[01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:58.420]  some kind, I don't know if it's really legal,
[01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:00.900]  if it's just policy, but I've been told
[01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:03.000]  that when they get a review back,
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.220]  I don't know, do they trash it?
[01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:07.440]  I just, I've been told that they wipe it
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:11.680]  and then treat it like a prototype.
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:12.640]  I don't know.
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:14.760]  That's interesting because normally,
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:16.460]  if you return one to a store,
[01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:18.320]  they don't go resell that to somebody else.
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:20.680]  They, as far as I know, they send it in for refurbishing.
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:22.360]  And refurbishing, they usually,
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:25.880]  I think they have to replace any component
[01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:28.000]  that people touch on the outside of it.
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.720]  So I think, please write into John if I'm wrong,
[01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:34.040]  I think they actually replace all the casing
[01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:35.360]  and keyboard and everything,
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:36.640]  and I think the only parts they refurbish
[01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:37.960]  are like the internals, right?
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:40.400]  And so if that's true, you can put as much tape
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:41.720]  on this keyboard as you want.
[01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:43.120]  I guess now that I think about it,
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:45.720]  I don't, I shouldn't say that they don't refurbish.
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:48.920]  All I know is they do promise that the first thing they do
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:53.200]  when a review unit gets sent back is wipe it clean.
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:54.440]  And they say this in a way like,
[01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:55.700]  you don't even have to worry about wiping it.
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:56.560]  Trust us, we'll wipe it.
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:59.240]  I still wipe them before I send it back, but.
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:00.920]  Yeah, that would also, if it is refurbishment,
[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:03.000]  that's gotta be a part of the same process, right?
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:03.840]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:06.960]  But I still can't believe that on a $5,000,
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:08.960]  I think this is a $5,000 config.
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:10.200]  Something like that, yeah.
[01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:13.300]  That I'm thinking about solving a problem with gaff tape.
[01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:15.120]  But it really does drive me nuts.
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:18.080]  And I don't look, I mean, who looks?
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:20.080]  You just go, like part of the reason
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:21.940]  the arrow keys are down there in the bottom right
[01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:25.740]  is it's like this super, it's like a Fitts' Law thing.
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:29.400]  By putting it in a corner, you just,
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:30.720]  it's so easy to get your fingers there.
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:32.480]  And all of a sudden I'm like, what key is this?
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:34.760]  And even the way, even the new gap
[01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:36.520]  between the up and down keys
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:39.000]  is harder to feel the difference between.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:39.840]  Okay, that's shallower.
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:43.680]  And even like for me, like where the keyboard ends
[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:44.820]  and the rest of the case begins,
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:47.720]  like the corners and the edges around the keyboard
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:49.240]  where it's kind of sunken in slightly
[01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:51.140]  to accommodate the keyboard depth,
[01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:53.620]  that, because the keyboard depth has changed,
[01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:56.360]  that little sunken in area around the keyboard
[01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:57.680]  is now shallower.
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:59.520]  And so even that is harder to feel,
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:01.320]  like at the corner of the keyboard.
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:03.840]  So when you're reaching for that right arrow key,
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:05.640]  you used to be able to kind of just move your hand
[01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:07.560]  until you could feel that edge of the keyboard.
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:10.040]  But it's not just shallower between the up and down.
[01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:12.760]  There's no longer a strip of aluminum between them either.
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:13.840]  There hasn't been for a while.
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:14.680]  Oh, I thought there was.
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:16.240]  No, they kind of bend down.
[01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:18.640]  They'd form like two little valleys between up and down.
[01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:19.840]  Well, then it's just the shallower.
[01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:20.680]  It's a shallower.
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:22.680]  Even that is harder to feel and it drives me nuts.
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:24.960]  And I'm never going to enjoy that.
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:27.180]  And I really, really wish they would go back
[01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:29.960]  to the upside down T and just accept
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:33.940]  the aesthetic unpleasantness of the half key height
[01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:36.000]  pieces of aluminum that are just naked
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.480]  above the up and down keys.
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:40.420]  Yeah, if I was able to fix either,
[01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:41.960]  like if they would give me my magic wish
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:46.160]  and give me either more travel or inverted T arrows,
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:47.200]  I would pick inverted T arrows.
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:49.080]  All right, what about inverted T arrows
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:53.320]  or a row of function keys instead of the touch bar?
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:55.440]  Same decision, inverted key arrows.
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:56.280]  Yeah, same here.
[01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:01.520]  Touch ID is nice to have,
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:02.940]  but I've been wearing my Apple Watch all week,
[01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:06.120]  so I don't even need it.
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:07.600]  And I can't help but feel,
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.760]  and I suspected it would feel the same way,
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:14.520]  after an entire, almost an entire year now,
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:17.480]  10 months with an iPhone 10 in my pocket,
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:21.400]  I still feel like touch ID on the MacBook Pro
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:24.120]  feels like I'm using ancient technology.
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:26.440]  Like why can't this camera just look at me?
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:29.680]  There's a very nice, it doesn't even need a notch.
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:30.680]  There's a whole strip up here.
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:33.280]  They can put whatever they want up there.
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:35.600]  Why in the world doesn't this have face ID?
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:38.760]  Yeah, the MacBook Pro still has substantial screen bezels.
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:41.840]  Like if you look at that Huawei Matebook X,
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:45.720]  the MacBook rip off, when I saw one in a Microsoft store,
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:47.880]  I was actually very, it kind of struck me
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:51.000]  like how cool it looked, how futuristic it looked,
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.240]  because, and that's the one like you saw,
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:54.680]  everyone saw on The Verge a few months ago,
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:56.640]  that's the one that has the webcam
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:58.720]  is in a pop-up function key,
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:00.820]  where you hit the middle key in the function row,
[01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:03.480]  and it's actually the sort of pop-up webcam that pops up.
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:07.600]  So it's ridiculous on a number of fronts like that, but.
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:10.400]  They did succeed in getting an edge to edge display.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:12.080]  But the display, they basically crammed
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:15.360]  like a roughly 14-inch display into a 13-inch body,
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:16.920]  and it looks incredible.
[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:18.520]  And it's like otherwise, it's like the same dimensions
[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:20.000]  as roughly and same weight roughly
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.760]  as the 13-inch MacBook Pro, and it really does look great.
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:26.240]  And I would love for them to reduce the bezels at all,
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:28.280]  in any way in the MacBook line,
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:30.280]  because what you want, same thing with the phone.
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:32.820]  You want the biggest screen and the smallest laptop, right?
[01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:34.440]  And so any progress towards that
[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:35.520]  would be great for the future.
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:37.020]  Well, and that brings me to one of the things
[01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:40.080]  that I genuinely dislike about this machine,
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:43.240]  and I've disliked it ever since they came out in 2016,
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:45.960]  which is that it now, again,
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:49.140]  says MacBook Pro on the bezel.
[01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:49.980]  Yeah.
[01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:51.680]  When they, and I was just talking,
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:53.520]  I had a Twitter discussion with some people today,
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:54.360]  and some of them are like,
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:56.120]  I've never had one without that.
[01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:57.720]  And that's because you skipped
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:02.200]  the initial Retina MacBook Pros.
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:03.040]  So the.
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:03.880]  2012s.
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:06.840]  Yeah, the 2012s, when the Retina MacBook Pros
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:10.760]  went to Retina, they no longer printed MacBook Pro
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:12.960]  on the bezel, it was just black, just black.
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:15.600]  More like an iPhone, like in a way that
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:19.320]  every other competitor, and it's always been baffling to me
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:21.200]  that Samsung would rip off,
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:24.640]  especially in the iPhone 3G, 3GS era,
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:27.560]  when the whole patent lawsuit came about,
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:29.340]  and they had the phone that was held up in court,
[01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:32.360]  and a Samsung marketing person couldn't tell
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:35.600]  whether it was an iPhone 3G or a Samsung phone.
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:37.600]  They tried to make their phones look so much like an iPhone,
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:40.020]  it was absolutely embarrassing for somebody
[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:42.740]  who's not claiming to make counterfeit products.
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:46.520]  But they always insisted on printing
[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:50.900]  their ugly-ass Samsung logo on the forehead, or the chin,
[01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:51.880]  I don't know where they printed it,
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:53.560]  but somewhere on the front of the phone,
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:55.440]  they'd put a big old Samsung logo,
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:57.540]  and Apple never printed anything,
[01:36:57.540 --> 01:37:00.780]  and of course, never allowed the carriers
[01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:03.920]  to print anything on the actual face of the phone.
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:07.260]  I like that on my personal MacBook Pro so much,
[01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:10.040]  and I find this so distracting,
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:13.080]  and it's not shiny, it's not white, it's gray,
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:15.160]  but my eyes just keep looking at it,
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:17.680]  and I just keep thinking, why, why would,
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:18.820]  once you've got away from it,
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:21.080]  and you just had that nice, perfect black border,
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:22.080]  why would you do that?
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.840]  It's just like with TVs.
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:27.820]  When you see a big screen TV,
[01:37:27.820 --> 01:37:29.560]  and the way that bezels have shrunk on TVs,
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:32.080]  it's similar to the phones now, where they couldn't,
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:33.720]  even Samsung has stopped printing their name,
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:35.760]  because they can't, because they've gotten,
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:37.200]  it doesn't fit, right?
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:38.620]  And TVs have gotten to that point,
[01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:42.320]  but having a distractive manufacturer name
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:44.620]  on the bezel of a TV is incredibly distracting,
[01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:45.800]  and you know Apple wouldn't do it.
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:47.760]  I don't know why they went back to this on the MacBook Pro,
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:52.520]  but my theory is that it coincides with the fact
[01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:54.740]  that the top, the display is so thin now
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:57.640]  that they can't backlight the Apple logo.
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:58.480]  So it's.
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:37:59.600]  Honestly, I kind of miss that still,
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:03.680]  but when I see now, when I see a mixed company,
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:06.440]  laptop party going on, like you see some
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:08.000]  that have the glowy one and some that don't,
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.680]  I do admit the glowy one does look old now,
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:12.760]  just because that's what the old models have,
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:13.960]  but I do kind of miss that.
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:16.280]  I miss it too, but I asked about it,
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:21.280]  and it really wasn't like, it was something
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:26.160]  that people from Apple seldom admit to anything like this,
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:29.600]  but they even said it wasn't really that we didn't want it,
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:32.400]  or preferred not having it, it's just too thin,
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:35.120]  that we couldn't make the top that thin and backlight it.
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:38.880]  It's, you know, you need a light here for this and this.
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:42.320]  Well, and like the extreme thinness of these,
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:45.720]  you know, the display lids on laptops now,
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:47.320]  I think that might cause problems
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:48.880]  for ever having Face ID in these things.
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:49.720]  Yeah, that is possible.
[01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:50.560]  You mentioned Touch ID earlier,
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:53.120]  like, and I kind of have a mixed opinion
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:55.060]  on Touch ID versus Face ID,
[01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:57.480]  like whenever I use Touch ID for something,
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:59.100]  now that I'm also accustomed to Face ID,
[01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:02.200]  like whenever I use Touch ID, I both think,
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:03.680]  oh, how quaint it's the past,
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:05.620]  and also, oh, that was fast and easy.
[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:08.960]  So it's, I'm slightly torn on,
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:11.760]  because like, I do, Face ID is mostly fine,
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:14.820]  but I do like with Touch ID, not only how fast it is,
[01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:19.320]  but how the, like, the permission granting step
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:22.040]  is the same step as the authentication.
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:24.140]  With Face ID, like, it authenticates you,
[01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:25.960]  and then you have to confirm somehow,
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:27.040]  well, you know, double tap the side button
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:27.900]  or whatever else.
[01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:29.580]  With Touch ID, that's one thing.
[01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:31.980]  You put your finger on, and that is both authenticating you
[01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:33.840]  and saying, I approve this transaction.
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:35.880]  Have you used an iPhone with Touch ID recently?
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:37.460]  Did you, like, install beta on it?
[01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:40.400]  Yeah, it's fine, like, it does feel old
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:41.360]  in the iPhone sense,
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:44.920]  but in the sense of authorizing purchases,
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:48.080]  it still feels nicer to me than Face ID.
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:50.160]  The last few years, I have,
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:51.560]  every summer, I've done the same thing,
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:53.400]  which I've taken my,
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:59.040]  before I installed the iOS beta on my main phone,
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:01.200]  which I'm probably on the cusp of doing,
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:03.480]  because I feel like the betas have been really stable
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:04.320]  this year.
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:05.720]  It's fine.
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:07.040]  But in the early betas,
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:09.720]  I would install them on a year-old iPhone
[01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:13.940]  and put my SIM card in that and use that as my daily phone
[01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:14.860]  to see how the thing is.
[01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:15.740]  I tried that this year,
[01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:18.420]  and the lack of Face ID drove me nuts.
[01:40:18.420 --> 01:40:20.680]  And just, I've gotten so addicted to things
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:23.020]  like being able to look, without unlocking it,
[01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:25.560]  just look and have my notifications go
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:28.440]  from not showing the text of the notifications
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:29.600]  to, okay, we see it's you.
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:31.180]  Here's the text of the notifications,
[01:40:31.180 --> 01:40:32.560]  and I can just read them.
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:35.040]  That feature alone, I can't live without.
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:35.880]  So I don't need that.
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:36.700]  I don't need that.
[01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:37.680]  My stuff is not that secure.
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:38.520]  I don't need it.
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:40.240]  Oh, so you have the full text just right there
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:41.080]  when you wake it up?
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:41.920]  I turned off attention detection also
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:44.560]  because it made Face ID more reliable and faster.
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:46.280]  Because, again, it's like, I don't,
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.760]  it's never, the first time somebody holds my phone
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:50.920]  up to my sleeping face and it authorizes,
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:51.840]  then I'll turn it off.
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:52.840]  I should think about that,
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:54.560]  because I still have the problem
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:57.240]  where my favorite sunglasses don't work with that.
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:40:58.220]  I should think about that.
[01:40:58.220 --> 01:40:59.060]  Maybe I'll turn it off.
[01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:00.200]  I don't know if it'll fix that or not,
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:02.880]  but it certainly makes it more forgiving.
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:03.720]  Yeah, I think it would,
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:05.960]  because I think the only thing the sunglasses block
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:07.960]  is the ability to see what you're looking at.
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:10.160]  I think that they get enough other data points
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:13.320]  from your nose and your cheeks and chin and et cetera.
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:15.560]  What I miss, whenever I have to use his phone or something,
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:17.720]  because she has an eight plus and I have the 10,
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:19.580]  and whenever I have to use her phone,
[01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:23.760]  what throws me off the most is not Touch ID,
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:26.320]  but tapping the screen doesn't wake it up.
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:27.160]  Right, right.
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:28.200]  Oh, that drives me nuts.
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:29.040]  I can't use it.
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:31.080]  Yeah, and so I'm addicted to the 10,
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:32.520]  but I want Face ID in this,
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:33.360]  but I think you're right
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:34.680]  that the thinness might be a problem.
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:36.920]  It might take longer than I fear
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:38.400]  for them to get the sensor array
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:39.880]  to be thin enough to fit there.
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:40.840]  Well, and ultimately,
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:42.320]  they might never put Face ID in the MacBook.
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:43.160]  Maybe.
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:44.760]  Like, Touch ID is fine
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:46.920]  for the context of unlocking a MacBook.
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:49.760]  In fact, in some ways, it's actually better,
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:51.840]  and it's also, you know, it's possible
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:54.640]  that they could put the Face ID camera and sensor
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:55.760]  in the Touch bar.
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:57.480]  It doesn't have to be in the screen lid.
[01:41:57.480 --> 01:41:58.320]  Right.
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:41:59.160]  I don't think they would.
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:00.440]  I don't think they want to spend the space,
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:01.280]  and I don't think they want to have
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:02.200]  like a separate sensor area
[01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:03.800]  like above the keyboard row there,
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:06.260]  but, you know, it doesn't necessarily need
[01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:07.320]  to be in the screen lid,
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:09.080]  but if it ever does go in the screen lid,
[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:11.080]  that would be a heck of a feat of miniaturization
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:12.320]  because these things are so,
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:14.040]  like the screen lids are so thin,
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:15.200]  and there's really no reason
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:16.520]  to make them thicker than they need to be
[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:18.320]  just for a Face ID camera.
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:19.440]  I think the original story,
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:20.280]  I could be getting this wrong,
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:21.100]  but I think I'm right
[01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:23.400]  that the original glowing apple
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:27.240]  on the back of a PowerBook
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:29.320]  was sort of a,
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:30.520]  hey, why don't we?
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:33.460]  Because the LCD technology at the time
[01:42:33.460 --> 01:42:34.680]  generated a lot of light,
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:35.640]  and they realized that,
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:39.200]  hey, if we just put like a translucent apple logo there,
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:40.960]  we could just let the light from the display
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:41.800]  shine through the apple,
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:43.120]  and the apple logo will light up.
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:44.600]  I'm pretty sure that was the explanation
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:45.440]  for how it worked.
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:47.680]  And the current displays don't work like that anymore.
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:50.080]  I don't know at what point the technology changed,
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:52.940]  but like the screen only glows in one direction now.
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:55.200]  And so they added,
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:56.440]  but they loved the feature so much
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:58.120]  that they put a separate lighting system in
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:42:59.640]  to keep the apple logos lighting up.
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:00.600]  And that's why.
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:01.440]  I didn't know that.
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:02.260]  Yeah, well, that's why,
[01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:04.760]  because if they could still get the light from the display,
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:06.720]  the thickness wouldn't be a worry.
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:07.960]  They would just, you know,
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:10.360]  they just don't put anything in between the display
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:11.280]  and the apple logo.
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:12.120]  But.
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:14.640]  That would also probably cause like a brightness drop
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:15.800]  in the middle of the screen,
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:17.080]  like as things get more sensitive
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:18.040]  and thinner and everything,
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:20.060]  like I can see why that would be challenging
[01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:20.900]  to do technically.
[01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:23.160]  It is possible that I'll have to do follow up
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:24.040]  on the next episode,
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:25.460]  and somebody will tell me that I'm nuts
[01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:27.020]  that it was always a separate lighting thing.
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:28.600]  But I'd seem to recall that when they first did it,
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:30.320]  like if you made your display,
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:32.300]  that as you dimmed your display,
[01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:33.640]  the apple logo would dim.
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:34.840]  And as you brightened your display,
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:36.220]  the apple logo would brighten.
[01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:38.040]  Yeah, I just, I assumed it was always that way.
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:39.920]  Like I assumed that it was always just leaking light
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:40.920]  from the back lights basically.
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:42.080]  No, if you look at like,
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:43.420]  if you look at like the modern ones,
[01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:45.180]  the apple doesn't change brightness
[01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:46.020]  with the screen.
[01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:47.080]  Oh man, I'll take a look after the show.
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:47.920]  I don't know.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.260]  What else on my personal thoughts on this?
[01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:52.320]  The SSD.
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:54.560]  The SSD is so fast.
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:55.840]  I haven't run any benchmarks
[01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:58.000]  because so many people with these reviews
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.920]  and like the YouTube crowd does such a great job
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:01.080]  with benchmark.
[01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:03.260]  I mean, they like too good of a job.
[01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:04.100]  It's like, oh my God,
[01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:07.000]  just shut up and tell me how fast it is.
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:07.840]  So I'm not running tests.
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:09.800]  Hey guys, make sure to like and subscribe.
[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:11.280]  Here's 15 minutes of preamble
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:12.120]  before I actually tell you
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:13.460]  the one frame you want to see in the video.
[01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:14.420]  But the new ones,
[01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:16.440]  and I think that it's true.
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:17.280]  You might know,
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:18.840]  you memorize stuff like this better than me, Marco.
[01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:22.420]  But I think all of the new MacBook Pros
[01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:24.800]  have this new SSD that's super fast.
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:26.280]  It's not just a 15 inch thing.
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:27.600]  The 13 inch has it too.
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:28.420]  That's correct.
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:29.260]  That comes along with the T2.
[01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:31.400]  So the T2, among the list of things it does,
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:33.200]  it's also the disk controller now.
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:35.000]  Like the T1 that was in the previous generation
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.800]  touch bars wasn't that advanced.
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:38.560]  It started with the iMac Pro
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:40.340]  and Apple is basically,
[01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:41.480]  they've written their own controller
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:43.120]  and it's integrated into the T2
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:45.840]  and it is directly addressing the flash chips.
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:49.400]  And so this gives a number of performance improvements.
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:51.200]  It happens to be a really good
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:52.880]  and really competitive disk controller.
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:54.920]  So if you compare it to,
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:57.800]  if you would have just put a Samsung SSD in your computer,
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:45:01.000]  then there's a Samsung controller on that SSD
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.440]  that controls the flash and everything.
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:05.080]  So that's kind of how this is.
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:08.280]  It's Apple's controller there instead of somebody else's.
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:09.540]  And it's really good.
[01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:11.400]  And on the iMac Pro,
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:15.420]  they were using dual SSD modules in parallel.
[01:45:15.420 --> 01:45:17.560]  Kind of like a RAID 0 but at a lower level.
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:19.080]  So they were using dual modules in parallel
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:21.160]  to get even better performance.
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:23.080]  And on the MacBook Pro,
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:25.680]  it appears that they're hitting those same numbers.
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:27.200]  So I think they're using the same thing
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:28.040]  where they're just like,
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:31.160]  they're running multiple flash modules in parallel
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:33.320]  and which is kind of always the case with SSDs,
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:35.200]  but they're doing it to a larger degree,
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:37.480]  I think, than is typically done.
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:39.280]  And their controller is excellent.
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:40.640]  And as far as, to the best of my knowledge,
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:42.520]  it applies to every configuration
[01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:44.640]  of the new 13 and 15 inch.
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:49.280]  So, but it actually is weird.
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:54.280]  So like, it's so fast that the other day,
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:59.280]  I needed to install a beta version of BB edits.
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.280]  I just measured, I just weighed it.
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:02.320]  It's 39 megabytes.
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:03.940]  So it's, you know, by today's standards,
[01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:05.620]  39 megabyte is not much.
[01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:09.520]  But I had a disk image.
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:10.960]  And so there's definitely a copy.
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:12.540]  This isn't like an APFS thing.
[01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:13.520]  It was like, you know,
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:15.160]  the whole thing where you open the disk image
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:16.280]  and then in the disk image,
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:17.520]  there's a little arrow saying here,
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:20.160]  point it to this, you know,
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:22.420]  SIM link to your applications folder.
[01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:25.520]  I drug it over and let go and nothing happened.
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:29.080]  And I was like, oh, and I blamed it on the track pad,
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:31.240]  which I guess I should get to because the track pad,
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:34.800]  I'm not used to this no physical click track pad.
[01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:36.860]  And it's size.
[01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:39.440]  And the size and the fact that it has force touch.
[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:40.440]  So I've, and I've,
[01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:43.640]  so I've had misclicking things in, you know, earlier
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:45.280]  in the week where there's, you know,
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:46.940]  things that I thought I was dragging,
[01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:49.120]  I've dropped before I was ready and stuff.
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:51.480]  So I figured I misclicked, but it was actually there.
[01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:54.120]  It just happened so fast that the finder didn't even have
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:56.520]  time to show the dialogue box.
[01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:58.480]  And I realized 38 megabytes isn't that big,
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:46:59.760]  but I've never seen that before.
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:02.480]  Like I just, I got no feedback whatsoever
[01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:04.400]  that it actually copied this application
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:06.440]  to my applications folder.
[01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:07.260]  It was so fast.
[01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:09.200]  It is absolutely astounding.
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:12.200]  I think like we're lucky in that in the last few years,
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:13.520]  as Intel is having all these troubles
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:15.200]  moving the CPU's forward,
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:18.240]  there's been not that much progress in CPU performance,
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:20.280]  but computers keep getting faster
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:25.200]  because there's been huge leaps in GPU and SSD performance.
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:26.560]  And increasingly those, you know,
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:29.000]  the GPU is increasingly being used by lots of things
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.360]  and the SSD is used by pretty much everything.
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:33.500]  So almost every workload can be improved
[01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:34.680]  by increasing SSD performance.
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:36.560]  And Apple has been really, really good at that recently.
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:39.200]  I mean, you know, and SSDs have been great even since
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:42.000]  we first made it into consumer technology,
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.760]  even when they, you know, by today's standards,
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:44.600]  they were crude.
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:48.040]  They've always been great and they're so much more reliable
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:49.880]  and they're dead quiet, et cetera.
[01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:52.080]  But it really is like, we're living in the future
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:54.640]  that like 20 years ago, we imagined,
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:56.400]  like where you would make a Ram disc,
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:58.120]  you'd make a disc image in Ram,
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:00.520]  then let, you know, tell Photoshop, use this, you know,
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:03.240]  or some kind of disc intensive application here.
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:07.280]  Here's a quote unquote disc that's really using up
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:11.240]  very valuable Ram, but to have real fast read-write.
[01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:12.640]  And everything just happens instantly
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:13.480]  and there's no waiting.
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:16.080]  Right, like we're living with an SSD performance like this.
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:18.320]  We're living in the future where literally
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:21.280]  persistent storage is like having a Ram disc, it's crazy.
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:22.680]  Yeah, and like a lot of people, you know,
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:25.880]  you're looking at your old laptop from 2012 through 2015,
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:28.440]  maybe, or even earlier, and you're thinking, you know,
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:30.420]  what do the new ones get me?
[01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:33.160]  And the answer is on the processor side, not much.
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:36.040]  But this is the kind of thing where like if you upgrade,
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:37.120]  honestly, I still don't, you know,
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:39.760]  I think if your old laptop still works fine for you,
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:41.320]  I don't think it's that pressing of a need to upgrade,
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:44.400]  but if you upgrade, what you would be getting for that
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:46.840]  is some more CPU performance,
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:49.920]  but a lot more SSD and GPU performance.
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:51.580]  Yeah, it's absolutely nuts.
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:54.040]  All right, let me take another break here
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:55.860]  and thank another sponsor.
[01:48:55.860 --> 01:49:00.000]  That is who is being put to use this week in this house
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.360]  and it's our good friends at Away.
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:07.140]  Away makes luggage.
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:13.300]  And they make fantastic luggage out of some kind of fancy
[01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:16.360]  German polycarbonate plastic, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:20.520]  Just trust me, it's really, really nice stuff.
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:23.440]  And again, one of my favorite things that keeps me,
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:26.140]  I swear, like there's this whole industry of like,
[01:49:26.140 --> 01:49:28.400]  hey, we sell direct to you companies
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:31.540]  and they advertise on podcasts and it's great.
[01:49:31.540 --> 01:49:33.920]  You get these great products, they're high quality,
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:35.560]  and you get them at a low price
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:37.320]  because they cut out middlemen, blah, blah, blah.
[01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:38.440]  But the thing about these companies,
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:39.720]  and Away exemplifies it,
[01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:42.760]  is that you don't get overburdened by choice.
[01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:45.320]  Like, I hate making decisions
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:49.520]  where there's 13 different lines of luggage
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:51.440]  from the same company or something like that.
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:53.860]  Now, you don't, you just pick what size you want,
[01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:55.800]  you pick what color you want, and that's it.
[01:49:55.800 --> 01:50:00.040]  It is fantastic, it is so easy, and they're just
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:02.240]  absolutely great, they have a lifetime guarantee,
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:05.160]  they have a 100-day trial where you can just use it,
[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:08.000]  haul it, get one now for your August vacation,
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.900]  haul it around the world, wherever you're going.
[01:50:09.900 --> 01:50:12.360]  And if you don't like it, just send it back,
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:14.720]  it doesn't matter if it's all banged up,
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:16.360]  send it back to them, they'll give you your money back
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:19.600]  so you can try it, it's really, really great.
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:23.280]  And so they would have over 10 colors, five sizes,
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:25.160]  and the sizes are self-descriptive.
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:27.040]  It's not like Starbucks where you go in there
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:29.280]  and the small one's called Tall, you know,
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:30.360]  nonsense like that.
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:32.520]  Look, they've got the carry-on, the bigger carry-on,
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:33.800]  the medium and the large,
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:36.000]  and then there's also the kids carry-on.
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:39.720]  You know immediately, I've already told you,
[01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:41.300]  you know exactly how big these things are.
[01:50:41.300 --> 01:50:43.760]  I have the carry-on, not the bigger carry-on.
[01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:46.920]  I believe, I think that's the one I have, I don't know.
[01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:47.760]  But whatever I have.
[01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:48.800]  It's the one that used to be the only one.
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:50.440]  Yeah, so I think it's the carry-on.
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:53.420]  It fits in every overhead, I've had it for years now,
[01:50:53.420 --> 01:50:55.200]  it fits in every single overhead bin,
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:57.620]  on every plane I've been on.
[01:50:57.620 --> 01:51:00.900]  The wheels still feel brand new.
[01:51:00.900 --> 01:51:04.560]  Literally today, this week, I've got it upstairs.
[01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:06.140]  I had to drag it through a parking lot
[01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:09.200]  full of little grit and gravel and stuff like that.
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:11.900]  Indestructible wheels, they're the best wheels.
[01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:14.480]  Great handle, the handle moving up and down.
[01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:16.600]  Won't name the brand, but a friend who's here with us
[01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:18.840]  has a piece of luggage,
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:21.280]  handle of which is like the plastic's peeling off
[01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:22.820]  and he's only had it a couple of years.
[01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:24.400]  Mine seems like brand new.
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:26.960]  It is absolutely great stuff.
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:30.880]  They've got, man, people advertise patent pending
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:32.060]  and my eyes start to roll.
[01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:34.460]  They have a patent pending compression system
[01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:36.040]  helpful for overpackers.
[01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:39.880]  Well, I don't know about whether the patent system
[01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:41.360]  should support patents for such things,
[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:42.960]  but I'll tell you, they've got a really nice system
[01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:44.800]  for keeping your stuff in there.
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:46.540]  And I've never owned a suitcase
[01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:49.160]  where I can pack folded shirts
[01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:51.680]  and when I get to a place, open it up
[01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:54.220]  and the shirts are still perfectly folded
[01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:55.920]  like they came out of the drawer.
[01:51:55.920 --> 01:51:57.540]  It's a great system, it's simple.
[01:51:57.540 --> 01:52:00.200]  It's not like, maybe there is a manual.
[01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:02.320]  I didn't read it, I figured it out on my own.
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:04.480]  You just put your shirts on the right side,
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:05.440]  you put the thing over it,
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:07.960]  there's these little buckles that straighten it up.
[01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:10.220]  Now John, what if I have my dirty clothes
[01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:11.720]  when I'm traveling?
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:14.080]  I don't wanna mix those in with my regular clothes.
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:15.880]  Is there anything Awake can do to help me out?
[01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:17.640]  Yeah, they've got like a little bag.
[01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:20.320]  It's some kind of special fabric, I think,
[01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:22.020]  even that's supposed to keep odors out,
[01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:24.740]  but they have a little like dirty laundry bag right there.
[01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:27.480]  Takes up no space before you get there
[01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:28.800]  and once you get there,
[01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:30.560]  you just start stuffing your dirties in there,
[01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:32.760]  keeps them away from all of your clean clothes.
[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:34.900]  And so if you're making a multi-stop trip
[01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:35.840]  or if you've overpacked
[01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:38.060]  and you still have like three clean shirts
[01:52:38.060 --> 01:52:39.560]  as you're coming home,
[01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:41.600]  your clean stuff that you take out of the suitcase,
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:43.100]  you can just put right back in the closet
[01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:45.060]  because it hasn't been rubbing up against
[01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:47.420]  your dirty Mack Weldon underwear.
[01:52:47.420 --> 01:52:52.020]  It's just great luggage, lifetime warranty,
[01:52:52.020 --> 01:52:54.080]  a hundred days, money back guarantee.
[01:52:55.100 --> 01:52:55.940]  I've got one.
[01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:57.980]  We've got a couple of them here in the house actually
[01:52:57.980 --> 01:53:01.300]  for this trip, really, really great stuff.
[01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:04.300]  And oh, the built-in cell phone charger,
[01:53:04.300 --> 01:53:09.020]  built-in little, I don't know how many thousand mega amp
[01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:10.500]  or whatever you measure those things by,
[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:12.020]  but two USB ports.
[01:53:13.020 --> 01:53:15.420]  You can sit there at the airport, any seat in the airport.
[01:53:15.420 --> 01:53:18.220]  Don't look, you no longer hunt for seats at the airport
[01:53:18.220 --> 01:53:20.060]  or no longer fish through your bag
[01:53:20.060 --> 01:53:22.300]  for the pocketable battery pack.
[01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:24.380]  Just find a seat at the airport,
[01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:26.500]  keep your carry on in front of you,
[01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:29.080]  flip the little thing and you can plug your iPhone
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:30.220]  right in right there.
[01:53:30.220 --> 01:53:32.460]  I use that every time I go to the airport now.
[01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:34.140]  I can't remember the last time I haven't used it
[01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:35.900]  and it's such a great feature.
[01:53:35.900 --> 01:53:38.100]  Actual capacity might be less than 10,000 mega amps.
[01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:39.420]  Yeah, well, whatever.
[01:53:40.260 --> 01:53:41.940]  It's enough to charge a bunch of phones.
[01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:43.420]  And the other thing too,
[01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:46.380]  it's enough that you don't have to charge your suitcase
[01:53:46.380 --> 01:53:48.180]  every time you get somewhere or when you go.
[01:53:48.180 --> 01:53:49.700]  I charge mine like once a year
[01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:51.400]  and every time I get to the airport,
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:53.780]  there's still juice in there for me to plug,
[01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:56.540]  or even two of us to plug our iPhones in
[01:53:56.540 --> 01:53:58.540]  for the however long we're waiting
[01:53:58.540 --> 01:54:00.400]  for our flight to be called.
[01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:01.400]  It's really fantastic.
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:03.200]  And you don't, that's the big, I should mention that
[01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:04.700]  because when I first heard about this,
[01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:06.180]  I thought, well, who the hell wants to have to charge
[01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:08.260]  your suitcase everywhere you go?
[01:54:08.260 --> 01:54:09.420]  It's not like that at all.
[01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:10.620]  So it's really great.
[01:54:10.620 --> 01:54:12.020]  Here's their special offer.
[01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:14.700]  You can save 20 bucks off a suitcase
[01:54:14.700 --> 01:54:19.700]  by going to awaytravel.com slash talk show,
[01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:22.420]  awaytravel.com slash talk show,
[01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:27.420]  and use promo talk show, know the during checkout.
[01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:31.380]  So go to awaytravel.com slash talk show.
[01:54:31.380 --> 01:54:33.180]  Remember that promo code talk show
[01:54:33.180 --> 01:54:35.940]  and you will save 20 bucks off your suitcase.
[01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:38.280]  Really, this is another one of those products
[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:39.980]  where even if they weren't a sponsor,
[01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:41.500]  I would tell you to go buy one
[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:43.660]  because it's a great product, it really is.
[01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:45.480]  You know, I see them everywhere now.
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:46.320]  Like when you're traveling,
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:47.980]  I see more and more away suitcases
[01:54:47.980 --> 01:54:49.700]  rolling through airports with people.
[01:54:49.700 --> 01:54:52.780]  Like they're spreading, they're popular for good reason.
[01:54:52.780 --> 01:54:53.680]  Well, they're popular enough.
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:55.860]  So I'll mention this, there's a new,
[01:54:55.860 --> 01:54:58.060]  like certain airlines now have a rule
[01:54:58.060 --> 01:55:03.060]  that if your bag goes into the under,
[01:55:04.340 --> 01:55:07.380]  you know, the check bags,
[01:55:07.380 --> 01:55:11.780]  it can't have a lithium ion battery in it anymore.
[01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:14.100]  So the battery that's built into away suitcases,
[01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:15.580]  this wasn't the policy when they made it,
[01:55:15.580 --> 01:55:17.060]  but they obviously had the foresight.
[01:55:17.060 --> 01:55:18.900]  It's very simple to remove it.
[01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:20.240]  You just unscrew two things
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:21.800]  and there's a little screwdriver
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:23.140]  that you can just keep right there.
[01:55:23.140 --> 01:55:25.160]  They give it to you so you don't have to, you know,
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:27.340]  happen to have a Phillips head screwdriver with you.
[01:55:27.340 --> 01:55:31.140]  So if you were planning to carry your bag on
[01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:32.900]  and they were like, oh, the overheads are full,
[01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:33.780]  you have to check it.
[01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:35.900]  And they see, hey, that's a battery.
[01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:38.460]  You know, now you're in trouble, what's gonna happen?
[01:55:38.460 --> 01:55:40.000]  It'll take you like a minute
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.340]  and you could unscrew this thing.
[01:55:41.340 --> 01:55:43.620]  It would take you longer to open the suitcase
[01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:44.460]  than it would to remove it.
[01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:45.680]  So it is easily removable,
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:47.620]  but the popularity is such that
[01:55:47.620 --> 01:55:50.140]  when you're going through the airport,
[01:55:50.140 --> 01:55:51.300]  TSA people will see it and they'll be like,
[01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:52.520]  hey, is that a battery?
[01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:53.940]  And I'll just say, oh, it's removable.
[01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:55.300]  And they're like, okay.
[01:55:55.300 --> 01:55:57.540]  But they definitely are used to seeing them.
[01:55:57.540 --> 01:55:59.700]  There's definitely a ton of them out there.
[01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:02.680]  So what else?
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:04.180]  A track pad I wanted to talk about.
[01:56:04.180 --> 01:56:06.220]  I'm getting used to it.
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:09.580]  I do miss the clickability.
[01:56:09.580 --> 01:56:11.620]  I feel like my physical,
[01:56:11.620 --> 01:56:13.500]  there's nothing beats a physical click.
[01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:14.320]  Agreed.
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:17.140]  It is uncanny how much this track pad
[01:56:17.140 --> 01:56:19.500]  feels like it's clicking, even though it actually isn't.
[01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:22.140]  It's absolutely uncanny.
[01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:25.620]  And I do turn up, like there's light, medium, and firm.
[01:56:25.620 --> 01:56:27.060]  I think they describe it as,
[01:56:29.060 --> 01:56:31.780]  you know, in terms of how much click do you want to feel
[01:56:31.780 --> 01:56:33.240]  when you're getting these fake clicks?
[01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:34.080]  What do they call it?
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:35.980]  Light, medium, and firm, yep.
[01:56:35.980 --> 01:56:38.500]  I bump it up, you know, medium is of course the default.
[01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:42.460]  I bump it up to firm just because I'm, you know,
[01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:45.820]  retro, like I'm an old person who wants it
[01:56:45.820 --> 01:56:47.580]  to feel the most like the old ones.
[01:56:48.460 --> 01:56:50.260]  Do you think the keyboards will ever have an option
[01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:53.820]  to emit fake keyboard sounds to sound like your keyboard?
[01:56:53.820 --> 01:56:55.140]  No, I don't think so.
[01:56:55.140 --> 01:56:56.820]  Because they make enough sound as is.
[01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:57.980]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:56:57.980 --> 01:56:59.920]  And I don't use it for the sound.
[01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:02.340]  The sound is a byproduct of the feel.
[01:57:02.340 --> 01:57:04.500]  It's the feel that matters.
[01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:06.580]  I found my recipe for happiness
[01:57:06.580 --> 01:57:08.380]  with the ForceTux track pads,
[01:57:08.380 --> 01:57:11.020]  because I too really miss the old ones.
[01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:15.280]  And the new ones I don't think are as good,
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:16.660]  but I have reached the point where I think
[01:57:16.660 --> 01:57:19.300]  that they're good enough that I stopped caring.
[01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:22.200]  And my recipe for happiness is not only to put it
[01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:27.020]  on the firm kickback mode, but also to disable 3D touch.
[01:57:27.020 --> 01:57:28.140]  I'm on the cusp of that.
[01:57:28.140 --> 01:57:31.380]  I'm absolutely on the cusp of disabling 3D touch
[01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:32.980]  because I never seem to want it.
[01:57:32.980 --> 01:57:35.020]  And the only reason I haven't so far
[01:57:35.020 --> 01:57:37.420]  out of a knee-jerk frustration of when it's kicked in
[01:57:37.420 --> 01:57:40.960]  and I didn't want it is just that I don't wanna disable it
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:42.180]  just because I'm not used to it.
[01:57:42.180 --> 01:57:45.580]  I don't wanna be that old man who wants to get rid
[01:57:45.580 --> 01:57:47.140]  of all the new stuff as quickly as I can.
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:48.140]  I wanna give it a shot.
[01:57:48.140 --> 01:57:49.020]  I will be that old man,
[01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:51.180]  because I'm telling you it's so much better.
[01:57:51.180 --> 01:57:54.040]  Because the problem with the 3D touch on the track pad
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:56.500]  is like, so on Macs the way this works,
[01:57:56.500 --> 01:57:58.040]  for anybody who somehow doesn't know
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:57:59.740]  who's been living under a Mac rock,
[01:57:59.740 --> 01:58:03.700]  is that you basically have like two simulated levels
[01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:04.620]  of pressure on the track pad.
[01:58:04.620 --> 01:58:07.380]  So the first pressure level is the regular click.
[01:58:07.380 --> 01:58:08.860]  And then if you kinda click harder,
[01:58:08.860 --> 01:58:10.920]  like if you push further in on your,
[01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:13.180]  in like the virtual depth of it,
[01:58:13.180 --> 01:58:14.620]  you get the secondary function.
[01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:17.340]  And it's not, it doesn't do a right click.
[01:58:17.340 --> 01:58:18.820]  It does some kind of third option
[01:58:18.820 --> 01:58:21.180]  that is supported by not that many things.
[01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:23.100]  And it provides some kind of shortcut.
[01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:25.780]  And ultimately I have found, when I've had it on
[01:58:25.780 --> 01:58:28.860]  and when I've tried using it, I have found it,
[01:58:28.860 --> 01:58:31.560]  I never want the thing that it offers me
[01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:34.100]  on the second level, but I frequently accidentally
[01:58:34.100 --> 01:58:36.140]  invoke it, especially when I'm trying to drag things.
[01:58:36.140 --> 01:58:37.440]  So that's exactly it.
[01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:40.960]  So the one where I almost like in a rage turned it off
[01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:43.600]  was I went to drag something from the finder
[01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:46.140]  and instead got quick look.
[01:58:46.140 --> 01:58:47.460]  Because that's what you get in a finder
[01:58:47.460 --> 01:58:50.780]  when you 3D click on an item in the finder.
[01:58:50.780 --> 01:58:52.020]  You get a quick look of it.
[01:58:52.020 --> 01:58:53.720]  Well, why in the world do I want a quick look
[01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:55.260]  of an application?
[01:58:55.260 --> 01:58:58.240]  Just shows you the application icon, big.
[01:58:58.240 --> 01:58:59.080]  And it's-
[01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:01.180]  Well, like the space bar isn't that hard to hit.
[01:59:01.180 --> 01:59:02.500]  Right, right.
[01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:03.700]  Especially with these new ones,
[01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:05.740]  it's like a millimeter away from the track pad.
[01:59:05.740 --> 01:59:07.700]  Right, it's not far away.
[01:59:07.700 --> 01:59:09.620]  It's not like your hand has to move far,
[01:59:09.620 --> 01:59:11.820]  especially if your hand is already on the keyboard
[01:59:11.820 --> 01:59:14.100]  and you're using your thumb for the drag,
[01:59:14.100 --> 01:59:16.940]  which is very typical for me, but it's also less precise.
[01:59:16.940 --> 01:59:20.580]  Like if I use my index finger, I never do it by accident,
[01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:24.380]  but my thumb is a clumsier digit than my index finger.
[01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:27.220]  And my thumb is often, most often what I'm using
[01:59:27.220 --> 01:59:29.860]  on the track pad, and I'm more likely to trigger it.
[01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:31.980]  I'm also unconv-
[01:59:31.980 --> 01:59:35.180]  I remain unconvinced that the bigger track pad
[01:59:35.180 --> 01:59:37.200]  is in any way an advantage.
[01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:40.180]  There are downsides where you can get touches
[01:59:40.180 --> 01:59:41.780]  you didn't intend more often,
[01:59:41.780 --> 01:59:45.180]  and I don't see what I do
[01:59:45.180 --> 01:59:47.420]  where having the track pad be this much bigger
[01:59:47.420 --> 01:59:48.900]  is actually better.
[01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:50.100]  I'm unconvinced.
[01:59:50.100 --> 01:59:52.700]  I don't get tons of false touches,
[01:59:52.700 --> 01:59:56.460]  and I see that there's all these three fingers
[01:59:56.460 --> 02:00:01.460]  and your thumb in a pinching out thing exposes the desktop.
[02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:04.260]  I can see how some of these gestures are so complicated,
[02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:06.580]  or use so many fingers, I should say,
[02:00:07.660 --> 02:00:09.460]  that having the extra space might be helpful,
[02:00:09.460 --> 02:00:11.540]  but I'm unconvinced that this is actually better.
[02:00:11.540 --> 02:00:13.080]  And I wonder if they did it
[02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:15.340]  because somebody thinks it looks better.
[02:00:15.340 --> 02:00:18.060]  Or I think, keep in mind, when this body style
[02:00:18.060 --> 02:00:22.960]  was released in 2016 with the touch bar,
[02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:26.040]  this was kind of Apple making a statement
[02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:29.300]  that no, the trend of literally everyone else's laptops
[02:00:29.300 --> 02:00:32.100]  going touch screen hybrid, that's wrong.
[02:00:32.100 --> 02:00:33.760]  What you want is the touch surface
[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:35.700]  to be on the same plane as the keyboard.
[02:00:35.700 --> 02:00:36.580]  Like that was Apple,
[02:00:36.580 --> 02:00:38.180]  that was the statement they were making to the world.
[02:00:38.180 --> 02:00:40.320]  So I think it was part of like,
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:43.340]  in making that statement as strongly as they could,
[02:00:43.340 --> 02:00:45.700]  not only do they ship the touch bar on the top,
[02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:47.060]  above the keyboard, but then below the keyboard
[02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:48.660]  they have this massive touch area to say,
[02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:50.460]  look, this whole thing is touchable.
[02:00:50.460 --> 02:00:51.620]  You don't need to touch the screen.
[02:00:51.620 --> 02:00:52.660]  By the way, I think they're wrong on that.
[02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:57.660]  But regardless, I think it's the real world problem
[02:00:57.820 --> 02:00:59.780]  with this is very similar to what I just described
[02:00:59.780 --> 02:01:02.540]  with force touch, or 3D touch on the trackpad,
[02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:06.620]  which is like the occurrence of accidental input
[02:01:06.620 --> 02:01:10.500]  and like an unintended or failed attempts
[02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:13.560]  to do basic things like type without mousing around,
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:17.380]  the accidental input happens more often
[02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:19.140]  than the intended use.
[02:01:19.140 --> 02:01:21.820]  Like if the intended use is to allow a lot of those
[02:01:21.820 --> 02:01:23.860]  big multi, like four finger gestures,
[02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:26.820]  do people really use those much more often
[02:01:26.820 --> 02:01:28.260]  than they accidentally burst the trackpad
[02:01:28.260 --> 02:01:29.100]  while they're trying to type?
[02:01:29.100 --> 02:01:30.440]  Like probably not.
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:32.860]  So this is another example to me.
[02:01:32.860 --> 02:01:35.560]  And I think it's also telling that when I went back,
[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:37.380]  after having one of these for like eight months,
[02:01:37.380 --> 02:01:41.020]  when I went back to my 2015 MacBook Pro,
[02:01:41.020 --> 02:01:42.580]  and therefore I went from a bigger trackpad
[02:01:42.580 --> 02:01:45.720]  to a smaller one, I like didn't notice at all.
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:46.940]  I didn't even notice for a second.
[02:01:46.940 --> 02:01:49.200]  I wasn't missing the extra space,
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:50.980]  even after being used to it pretty well.
[02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:54.140]  Like it was just like, well, that was unnecessary.
[02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:56.220]  Well, I kind of agree.
[02:01:56.220 --> 02:01:57.780]  And the fact that it causes the accidental input,
[02:01:57.780 --> 02:01:59.520]  I think like that to me is the damning thing.
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:02.660]  It's like if it didn't have any major downsides,
[02:02:02.660 --> 02:02:04.260]  fine, make it as big as it can be
[02:02:04.260 --> 02:02:05.820]  without causing major downsides.
[02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:06.780]  But I think they went too far.
[02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:09.140]  They made it too big and it does have major downsides
[02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:10.340]  with accidental input.
[02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:13.380]  And so to me, it's yeah, it's not worth it.
[02:02:13.380 --> 02:02:15.460]  Hasn't been too big of a problem for me in the last week.
[02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:18.900]  I think way less about the trackpad being all new
[02:02:18.900 --> 02:02:20.420]  than I think about the keyboard being new.
[02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:21.660]  The keyboard is something I'm thinking about
[02:02:21.660 --> 02:02:22.500]  every time I type.
[02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:24.420]  And the trackpad, it's like a couple of times a day.
[02:02:24.420 --> 02:02:26.360]  I'm like, ooh, what was that?
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:29.780]  And the force touch thing is more than the size.
[02:02:29.780 --> 02:02:30.620]  Agreed.
[02:02:30.620 --> 02:02:32.780]  I kind of wish, I think I wish that the keyboard
[02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:34.220]  was still the same size as it used to be.
[02:02:34.220 --> 02:02:37.540]  But I know that so far, I don't care for the 3D touch
[02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:38.620]  or force touch, whatever.
[02:02:38.620 --> 02:02:39.460]  Yeah, trackpad.
[02:02:41.100 --> 02:02:41.960]  What else?
[02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:45.780]  I had Jonas play Fortnite on it,
[02:02:45.780 --> 02:02:50.740]  which is a very GPU intensive thing
[02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:53.700]  and is notoriously bad on Macs.
[02:02:55.300 --> 02:02:56.980]  And it was pretty good, he said.
[02:02:56.980 --> 02:02:59.940]  He had to turn the graphics down from the default high
[02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:02.300]  to one click down, but he said it still looked good.
[02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:03.740]  It looked good to my eyes.
[02:03:03.740 --> 02:03:07.340]  And he was getting not quite 60 frames per second,
[02:03:07.340 --> 02:03:11.020]  but it seemed never to drop below 50
[02:03:11.020 --> 02:03:12.920]  and it tended to be in the high 50s.
[02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:15.420]  See, you don't need a gaming PC.
[02:03:15.420 --> 02:03:17.380]  You need a $5,000 MacBook Pro.
[02:03:17.380 --> 02:03:18.820]  Right, exactly.
[02:03:18.820 --> 02:03:19.660]  I thought that was an interesting test.
[02:03:19.660 --> 02:03:21.900]  Almost 360 frames a second.
[02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:24.160]  As a side note on that story, though,
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:25.420]  I thought the weirder thing,
[02:03:25.420 --> 02:03:28.180]  and to me it's a very telling anecdote
[02:03:28.180 --> 02:03:32.720]  about how important Mac gaming is to the gaming industry,
[02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:36.100]  is I installed Fortnite.
[02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:37.660]  Number one, this sucks.
[02:03:37.660 --> 02:03:42.380]  This is really a boohiss thing where to launch it,
[02:03:42.380 --> 02:03:44.340]  you have to get it from Epic.
[02:03:44.340 --> 02:03:45.620]  They don't sell it on the App Store
[02:03:45.620 --> 02:03:46.780]  and they don't have it in Steam
[02:03:46.780 --> 02:03:48.920]  because the whole game goes through in-app purchases
[02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:52.060]  and they don't wanna do a 30% split with anybody.
[02:03:52.060 --> 02:03:53.540]  I don't blame them for that.
[02:03:53.540 --> 02:03:55.620]  But you can't just download Fortnite
[02:03:55.620 --> 02:03:57.360]  and install fortnite.app.
[02:03:57.360 --> 02:03:58.560]  You have to install this thing
[02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:00.780]  called the Epic Games Launcher.
[02:04:00.780 --> 02:04:02.140]  And then every time you wanna play,
[02:04:02.140 --> 02:04:04.200]  you have to start the Epic Games Launcher
[02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:06.100]  and then launch Fortnite from there.
[02:04:07.140 --> 02:04:09.060]  And then once you install it,
[02:04:09.060 --> 02:04:12.220]  the Epic Games Launcher somehow, without asking,
[02:04:12.220 --> 02:04:13.460]  I don't know how they did it.
[02:04:13.460 --> 02:04:15.460]  It's weird, but I haven't quite figured it out.
[02:04:15.460 --> 02:04:19.340]  But they somehow, I think, maybe I'm wrong.
[02:04:19.340 --> 02:04:21.020]  Maybe it's just that I logged out
[02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:23.120]  and had the setting to relaunch everything that was there.
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:25.460]  But when I logged back in, I logged out and logged back in
[02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:28.060]  and the Epic Games Launcher launched again
[02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:29.000]  and wouldn't quit.
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:30.700]  I had to force quit it.
[02:04:30.700 --> 02:04:31.540]  And-
[02:04:31.540 --> 02:04:33.420]  Am I allowed to say epic fail?
[02:04:33.420 --> 02:04:34.240]  You are.
[02:04:35.300 --> 02:04:36.380]  That's awful.
[02:04:36.380 --> 02:04:37.540]  But here's the weird part.
[02:04:37.540 --> 02:04:40.260]  The really weird part was the first time we launched it
[02:04:40.260 --> 02:04:43.580]  and Jonas signed in with his credentials
[02:04:43.580 --> 02:04:47.220]  and got ready to play and everything loaded.
[02:04:47.220 --> 02:04:49.100]  And then it made, it's like finding a match,
[02:04:49.100 --> 02:04:50.900]  finding a hundred people for him to play against.
[02:04:50.900 --> 02:04:53.020]  And then it said, loading, dot, dot, dot.
[02:04:53.020 --> 02:04:54.700]  And a progress bar marched across.
[02:04:54.700 --> 02:04:58.900]  And the progress bar was like 98% of the way there
[02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:00.620]  and then just didn't go any further.
[02:05:00.620 --> 02:05:03.020]  And it wasn't frozen because the dot, dot, dot
[02:05:03.020 --> 02:05:05.660]  next to the word loading continued to animate.
[02:05:05.660 --> 02:05:08.460]  And it just kept waiting and waiting and waiting.
[02:05:08.460 --> 02:05:10.660]  I mean, minutes, literally minutes.
[02:05:10.660 --> 02:05:12.100]  And we were like, ah, what the hell?
[02:05:12.100 --> 02:05:13.340]  And it was like, I don't know what to do.
[02:05:13.340 --> 02:05:15.200]  And you couldn't quit at that time.
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:17.620]  So we had to force quit, did it again.
[02:05:17.620 --> 02:05:19.840]  And it just got that far and waited.
[02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:21.460]  Like easily, definitely minutes.
[02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:22.660]  I was like, give it a couple of minutes.
[02:05:22.660 --> 02:05:25.000]  And minutes and minutes and minutes.
[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:28.260]  And like way more minutes than it could possibly be normal.
[02:05:28.260 --> 02:05:30.260]  And it certainly wasn't waiting on the internet.
[02:05:30.260 --> 02:05:33.380]  The internet speed here is absolutely fantastic.
[02:05:33.380 --> 02:05:38.380]  It's like 150 megabits per second up and down, Marcos.
[02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:44.500]  So Jonas and I started searching the web for solutions.
[02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:46.380]  And I found, there were a couple of these,
[02:05:46.380 --> 02:05:48.700]  like infinite loading and some of them date back years.
[02:05:48.700 --> 02:05:53.120]  But then I found a thread just from June
[02:05:53.120 --> 02:05:56.580]  where somebody said they had this problem.
[02:05:56.580 --> 02:06:00.200]  And then somebody else said, wait about 10 minutes.
[02:06:00.200 --> 02:06:03.540]  It takes about 10 minutes for the first match.
[02:06:03.540 --> 02:06:05.060]  And then you'll be in.
[02:06:05.060 --> 02:06:07.100]  And then after that, subsequent matches
[02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:09.980]  will start up automatically.
[02:06:09.980 --> 02:06:12.240]  Epic has known about this since April.
[02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:14.340]  And he had like a link where he pointed to a thing
[02:06:14.340 --> 02:06:16.860]  where this exact problem was reported to Epic
[02:06:16.860 --> 02:06:18.220]  in like early April.
[02:06:18.220 --> 02:06:19.340]  And it's just on Mac.
[02:06:19.340 --> 02:06:20.660]  Just on Mac.
[02:06:20.660 --> 02:06:22.020]  And I think just some Macs,
[02:06:22.020 --> 02:06:24.420]  it seemed like everybody was saying MacBook Pro.
[02:06:25.540 --> 02:06:29.140]  So I don't know, it may not be every Mac,
[02:06:29.140 --> 02:06:30.420]  but it's certainly enough.
[02:06:31.420 --> 02:06:34.100]  Once you start Googling it, it's wide enough.
[02:06:34.100 --> 02:06:36.740]  Is it too soon to ask if it was throttling?
[02:06:36.740 --> 02:06:38.620]  No, but what a weird bug.
[02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:40.340]  Like the first match you play,
[02:06:40.340 --> 02:06:42.420]  you have to wait 10 minutes and weird enough.
[02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:44.020]  So the way Fortnite works is
[02:06:44.020 --> 02:06:45.620]  you're in a hundred person battle royale.
[02:06:45.620 --> 02:06:48.400]  A hundred people, free for all,
[02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:50.220]  last person standing wins.
[02:06:50.220 --> 02:06:54.080]  And you try to shoot everybody else on a big map.
[02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:55.900]  By the time Jonas got in on the one
[02:06:55.900 --> 02:06:56.860]  where he waited 10 minutes,
[02:06:56.860 --> 02:06:58.740]  there were only 30 people left.
[02:06:58.740 --> 02:07:02.380]  So like the game had, the match had been going on.
[02:07:02.380 --> 02:07:05.420]  And so in a weird way, it was sort of like a cheat
[02:07:05.420 --> 02:07:07.580]  because he got to start playing
[02:07:07.580 --> 02:07:09.820]  after 70 people had already been eliminated.
[02:07:09.820 --> 02:07:13.620]  It's sort of like jumping into a marathon at the 18th mile.
[02:07:13.620 --> 02:07:15.020]  It's like, hey, I'm winning.
[02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:18.940]  And as promised in the thread,
[02:07:18.940 --> 02:07:21.660]  he was eliminated and he said, I'll play again.
[02:07:21.660 --> 02:07:22.900]  And it loaded him.
[02:07:22.900 --> 02:07:24.760]  Everything was normal at that point.
[02:07:24.760 --> 02:07:28.380]  But I think that's so telling that a bug so glaring
[02:07:28.380 --> 02:07:31.220]  has existed in the Mac version of Fortnite since April.
[02:07:31.220 --> 02:07:33.140]  And they've had several updates since,
[02:07:33.140 --> 02:07:34.380]  it's not like they have an update,
[02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:36.500]  they update all the time and they haven't fixed it.
[02:07:36.500 --> 02:07:39.140]  Like clearly if this was an issue on the PlayStation
[02:07:39.140 --> 02:07:44.140]  or Xbox or the PC, it would be a priority one bug to fix.
[02:07:44.980 --> 02:07:48.700]  And the Mac, it's like, yeah.
[02:07:48.700 --> 02:07:50.540]  Yeah, the Mac is like half people in the company are like,
[02:07:50.540 --> 02:07:51.500]  we have a Mac version?
[02:07:51.500 --> 02:07:54.940]  Right, this is why people installed bootcamp
[02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:56.520]  to play games on their Mac.
[02:07:56.520 --> 02:08:00.540]  And that in turn is the biggest, hmm.
[02:08:00.540 --> 02:08:04.820]  I think we collectively might be underestimating
[02:08:04.820 --> 02:08:07.420]  the problems that might happen if and when Apple
[02:08:07.420 --> 02:08:09.620]  switches the Macs to ARM CPUs.
[02:08:09.620 --> 02:08:13.740]  And either bootcamp goes away
[02:08:13.740 --> 02:08:16.260]  or if somehow bootcamp still works
[02:08:16.260 --> 02:08:19.700]  and you can install like the ARM version of Windows,
[02:08:19.700 --> 02:08:22.540]  it certainly isn't gonna work with the Intel-based games.
[02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:26.580]  Well, I think maybe too, Apple has been losing gamers
[02:08:26.580 --> 02:08:28.080]  for a while, I mean, to a lot of degrees
[02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:29.140]  they never really had the gamers.
[02:08:29.140 --> 02:08:31.860]  Well, the Mac is losing gamers, Apple's not losing gamers.
[02:08:31.860 --> 02:08:33.620]  Well, right, yeah, good clarification.
[02:08:33.620 --> 02:08:35.380]  Yeah, iOS is doing great gamers.
[02:08:35.380 --> 02:08:38.780]  But yeah, the Mac has never prioritized gaming really
[02:08:38.780 --> 02:08:41.980]  and it seems to only be getting more and more distant
[02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:45.220]  from it as gaming is getting even more sophisticated.
[02:08:45.220 --> 02:08:48.360]  Like the GPUs for gaming are getting even more powerful
[02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:51.460]  and the difference between a gaming GPU
[02:08:51.460 --> 02:08:54.780]  and what Apple puts in its Macs is just getting,
[02:08:54.780 --> 02:08:56.500]  I think, wider and wider over time.
[02:08:56.500 --> 02:08:59.900]  And so Apple's solution to gamers on the desktop
[02:08:59.900 --> 02:09:04.000]  is buy an iMac Pro or a Mac Pro, that's not gonna work.
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:08.320]  And as VR comes in with gaming too,
[02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:12.180]  that becomes even less doable on Mac GPUs and Mac hardware.
[02:09:12.180 --> 02:09:15.920]  So I'm guessing that problem is just gonna work itself out
[02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:19.940]  that way where Macs will just become so bad
[02:09:19.940 --> 02:09:22.820]  as gaming platforms that gamers will just use gaming PCs
[02:09:22.820 --> 02:09:25.540]  and maybe have a Mac laptop on the side also,
[02:09:25.540 --> 02:09:28.620]  but separate those rules.
[02:09:28.620 --> 02:09:31.220]  So I think what Jonas wants, and it's weird,
[02:09:31.220 --> 02:09:34.760]  it doesn't break my heart, liking Apple stuff
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:39.180]  is not a religion for me, he wants a gaming PC.
[02:09:39.180 --> 02:09:41.140]  I don't think he wants, and we've told him,
[02:09:41.140 --> 02:09:43.620]  let's be serious about it, this is a serious,
[02:09:43.620 --> 02:09:45.020]  this is a lot of money.
[02:09:45.020 --> 02:09:50.020]  But he's still using a 2014 MacBook Pro,
[02:09:51.980 --> 02:09:54.980]  which is nice for an eighth grader, in my opinion.
[02:09:54.980 --> 02:09:56.860]  But it is four years old.
[02:09:56.860 --> 02:09:57.980]  And it's less nice for games.
[02:09:57.980 --> 02:09:59.780]  It is not nice for games at all.
[02:09:59.780 --> 02:10:01.940]  It's really irrelevant to most of the games
[02:10:01.940 --> 02:10:04.740]  he wants to play, but well, he plays so many games.
[02:10:04.740 --> 02:10:06.860]  But there's a game he plays, I don't know what it's called,
[02:10:06.860 --> 02:10:09.980]  but it's sort of like Risk, and you can play it online,
[02:10:09.980 --> 02:10:12.380]  and you can play it with your friends and stuff like that.
[02:10:12.380 --> 02:10:15.100]  But because it's like a map-based God view game,
[02:10:15.100 --> 02:10:17.460]  it's not graphically intensive at all.
[02:10:17.460 --> 02:10:22.460]  And it still makes his fans roar, absolutely roar.
[02:10:22.780 --> 02:10:26.080]  So yeah, but for stuff like, Fortnite even tells you,
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:30.060]  if you have the Intel Iris graphics set, it'll just die.
[02:10:30.060 --> 02:10:31.560]  You know, it just refuses to run.
[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:34.820]  I mean, and that's what a four-year-old MacBook Pro has.
[02:10:34.820 --> 02:10:35.780]  That's what every MacBook Pro has,
[02:10:35.780 --> 02:10:37.140]  if it's smaller than a 15-inch awesome.
[02:10:37.140 --> 02:10:39.340]  Right, right, yeah, so I think even a brand new
[02:10:39.340 --> 02:10:41.540]  13-inch MacBook Pro couldn't run Fortnite.
[02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:43.420]  That's probably right, because it does have Iris graphics.
[02:10:43.420 --> 02:10:46.580]  It might try, but Epic is very explicit
[02:10:46.580 --> 02:10:48.580]  that if you have an Intel Iris graphics set,
[02:10:48.580 --> 02:10:50.980]  you're asking for trouble.
[02:10:50.980 --> 02:10:53.700]  But the 15-inch MacBook Pro, or at least this one,
[02:10:53.700 --> 02:10:56.780]  runs it with, you know, again, you have to turn
[02:10:56.780 --> 02:10:58.860]  graphics down like one click from their default,
[02:10:58.860 --> 02:10:59.740]  but they still look good.
[02:10:59.740 --> 02:11:01.740]  Jonah said he'd be, you know, he was happy to play it.
[02:11:01.740 --> 02:11:03.220]  He thinks it compares very well to what
[02:11:03.220 --> 02:11:04.980]  his PlayStation 4 is capable of.
[02:11:05.860 --> 02:11:08.980]  But it's really hard to tell, because a 1080p TV
[02:11:08.980 --> 02:11:10.980]  is very, that you're sitting a few feet or from
[02:11:10.980 --> 02:11:15.060]  in front of, it's very different than a retina display
[02:11:15.060 --> 02:11:17.700]  that you're sitting a few inches in front of.
[02:11:17.700 --> 02:11:19.380]  But, you know, it runs, and I thought
[02:11:19.380 --> 02:11:20.380]  that was a pretty cool test.
[02:11:20.380 --> 02:11:25.060]  Also, though, it makes the machine egg-cooking hot.
[02:11:25.060 --> 02:11:27.660]  Yeah, that's the wrong tool for the job.
[02:11:27.660 --> 02:11:31.140]  I mean, like, I mean, it really gets hot.
[02:11:31.140 --> 02:11:34.180]  And as I sit here, as I brag about the battery life,
[02:11:34.180 --> 02:11:36.440]  I'm getting here doing nothing just looking at the screen.
[02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:40.180]  Right now, it still says 88%, and we're over two hours,
[02:11:40.180 --> 02:11:42.220]  over two hours of me staring at the screen
[02:11:42.220 --> 02:11:44.220]  at almost top brightness.
[02:11:44.220 --> 02:11:46.500]  Am I, what level am I at here?
[02:11:46.500 --> 02:11:48.100]  About 80% brightness.
[02:11:48.100 --> 02:11:49.520]  I'm at 88%.
[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:53.160]  Jonah's played one round of Fortnite, well, two.
[02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:55.460]  There was the one where he had the 10-minute wait,
[02:11:55.460 --> 02:11:57.720]  and then he played one normal match,
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:00.340]  and the battery dropped 26%.
[02:12:00.340 --> 02:12:02.740]  Yeah, and this, and with these laptops, too,
[02:12:02.740 --> 02:12:04.480]  with very high-powered components,
[02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:07.820]  when you have, like, the top-end GPUs, the top-end CPUs,
[02:12:07.820 --> 02:12:10.000]  it is often the case with modern laptops,
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:13.500]  including Apple's, that if you max them out like crazy,
[02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:15.360]  sometimes they can, even if they're plugged in,
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:17.000]  they can slowly discharge their own battery
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:18.900]  because they're using more power
[02:12:18.900 --> 02:12:21.260]  than the power adapter can supply.
[02:12:21.260 --> 02:12:24.060]  And so you actually have, you have limited amount of time,
[02:12:24.060 --> 02:12:26.180]  like, because they will eventually drain their own battery
[02:12:26.180 --> 02:12:28.140]  while plugged in and need to be shut down.
[02:12:28.140 --> 02:12:30.240]  So, like, this is, like, when I was,
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:32.300]  when I was, like, you know, going through puberty,
[02:12:32.300 --> 02:12:34.340]  and I started getting a mustache,
[02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:35.940]  for the first couple of months,
[02:12:35.940 --> 02:12:38.600]  my mom, like, didn't want to, like, admit to herself
[02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:39.900]  that I was growing up,
[02:12:39.900 --> 02:12:43.220]  and so she made me just occasionally trim it with scissors.
[02:12:43.220 --> 02:12:46.300]  Right, and, like, eventually, and it was ridiculous,
[02:12:46.300 --> 02:12:48.420]  and, like, eventually, after a couple of weeks
[02:12:48.420 --> 02:12:50.660]  or months of that, my uncle was like,
[02:12:50.660 --> 02:12:53.020]  you gotta get this boy a shaver.
[02:12:53.020 --> 02:12:55.300]  I feel like this is the wrong tool for this.
[02:12:55.300 --> 02:12:56.740]  You need to get your Sonic gaming PC.
[02:12:56.740 --> 02:12:58.060]  That's the real answer here.
[02:12:58.060 --> 02:12:59.420]  But he doesn't want a gaming laptop.
[02:12:59.420 --> 02:13:01.300]  He wants a desktop PC.
[02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:02.260]  That's the way to do it.
[02:13:02.260 --> 02:13:04.540]  Right, and, you know, he doesn't need it,
[02:13:04.540 --> 02:13:07.380]  you know, he could just take the Switch with him
[02:13:07.380 --> 02:13:08.420]  when he wants to play his perfectly,
[02:13:08.420 --> 02:13:10.620]  or play, you know, he plays lots of games on his phone,
[02:13:10.620 --> 02:13:12.460]  and I think that's a reasonable trade-off.
[02:13:12.460 --> 02:13:14.180]  I think he's actually making the right decision,
[02:13:14.180 --> 02:13:16.880]  where he's optimizing to have the best experience
[02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:19.300]  most of the time, which is when he's home,
[02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:21.740]  and just forget about PC gaming, period,
[02:13:21.740 --> 02:13:25.100]  when he's on the road, and use something like the Switch,
[02:13:25.100 --> 02:13:27.140]  or just an iPhone, that is actually meant
[02:13:27.140 --> 02:13:29.180]  for mobile gaming, for mobile gaming.
[02:13:29.180 --> 02:13:31.340]  I actually, I think that he's,
[02:13:31.340 --> 02:13:33.300]  I think he's got his priorities in line.
[02:13:33.300 --> 02:13:34.700]  Yeah, and that's, you know, like,
[02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:37.100]  there's been a, there was a series on back to work
[02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:38.500]  over the last, like, six months or so,
[02:13:38.500 --> 02:13:40.940]  where our friend Dan Benjamin built a gaming PC
[02:13:40.940 --> 02:13:43.440]  with his son, for his son, and then more recently,
[02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:45.780]  our friend Mike Hurley built one,
[02:13:45.780 --> 02:13:48.580]  and like, I gotta say, like, it sounds really fun,
[02:13:48.580 --> 02:13:50.620]  like, if I was into PC gaming,
[02:13:50.620 --> 02:13:52.520]  I would have a lot of fun building a gaming PC,
[02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:55.780]  and, because it's so, here's the thing,
[02:13:55.780 --> 02:13:58.100]  you have to, it's like going to McDonald's,
[02:13:58.100 --> 02:14:00.800]  like, everything is so, like, tacky,
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:03.760]  and it's like junk food for PCs,
[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:06.180]  like, everything's covered in colored lights,
[02:14:06.180 --> 02:14:08.060]  and everything, it's like, it's crazy,
[02:14:08.060 --> 02:14:09.860]  but it's all, like, it's all in service
[02:14:09.860 --> 02:14:11.420]  of the, you know, the love of PC gaming,
[02:14:11.420 --> 02:14:13.900]  which can be really awesome, and you just can't do it
[02:14:13.900 --> 02:14:15.580]  on laptops. Were those guys actually,
[02:14:15.580 --> 02:14:17.980]  quote, unquote, building one by ordering components
[02:14:17.980 --> 02:14:19.620]  separately and assembling? Yes, yeah.
[02:14:19.620 --> 02:14:20.860]  But, because even that.
[02:14:20.860 --> 02:14:24.020]  I'm leaning more towards just paying Alienware.
[02:14:24.020 --> 02:14:25.360]  I mean, you can do that, too, but, like,
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:27.780]  but, you know, if you or Jonas have an interest in that,
[02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:30.060]  like, they, like, you know, Mike did it
[02:14:30.060 --> 02:14:31.380]  for, like, a fun project for, like,
[02:14:31.380 --> 02:14:32.980]  you know, himself and his podcast,
[02:14:32.980 --> 02:14:34.260]  and then, and Dan Benjamin did it
[02:14:34.260 --> 02:14:35.780]  as, like, a fun thing for him to do with his son,
[02:14:35.780 --> 02:14:37.300]  and they both said it was, like,
[02:14:37.300 --> 02:14:39.420]  neither, like, Dan hadn't built a PC in years,
[02:14:39.420 --> 02:14:40.900]  and Mike had never built a PC.
[02:14:40.900 --> 02:14:42.060]  They both just followed online guides,
[02:14:42.060 --> 02:14:43.180]  and it was really easy.
[02:14:43.180 --> 02:14:45.020]  Like, it's, you know, it's a fun activity,
[02:14:45.020 --> 02:14:46.060]  but regardless of how you get it,
[02:14:46.060 --> 02:14:47.900]  I do think, like, a desktop gaming PC
[02:14:47.900 --> 02:14:49.740]  is the right move for this, because, like,
[02:14:49.740 --> 02:14:52.140]  you can struggle trying to, you know,
[02:14:52.140 --> 02:14:53.440]  cut this mustache with scissors,
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:55.680]  or you can get the actual right tool for the job,
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:58.500]  and the actual right tool for the job as a gaming PC.
[02:14:58.500 --> 02:15:00.480]  Uh, what else on this machine?
[02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:04.020]  I can't think of anything else on the MacBook Pro.
[02:15:04.020 --> 02:15:05.580]  Have you found, I mean, I know you haven't had it
[02:15:05.580 --> 02:15:06.540]  for that long, but what do you think
[02:15:06.540 --> 02:15:07.940]  about the port situation?
[02:15:07.940 --> 02:15:08.780]  Has that been a problem for you,
[02:15:08.780 --> 02:15:09.700]  or are you mostly okay?
[02:15:09.700 --> 02:15:11.240]  No, the only thing, because I don't,
[02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:13.100]  I haven't had a need for it,
[02:15:13.100 --> 02:15:15.200]  and I don't really use ports anyway.
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:18.580]  I really, I use very little USB stuff,
[02:15:18.580 --> 02:15:20.300]  especially when I'm traveling.
[02:15:20.300 --> 02:15:23.580]  The one thing we did run into was that,
[02:15:23.580 --> 02:15:26.680]  to play Fortnite, Jonas wanted to use his gaming mouse,
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:28.660]  which he did bring along, and the gaming mouse,
[02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:31.700]  of course, has a USB-A plug, and this doesn't have USB-A,
[02:15:31.700 --> 02:15:35.320]  and I thought I had a USB-C to A adapter in my backpack,
[02:15:35.320 --> 02:15:36.820]  and I know I own one somewhere,
[02:15:36.820 --> 02:15:39.260]  and I usually, you know, keep all of those
[02:15:39.260 --> 02:15:41.660]  little fiddly adapters, even when I use them at home
[02:15:41.660 --> 02:15:43.420]  when I'm done, I put them in my backpack,
[02:15:43.420 --> 02:15:46.300]  not like on my desk or shelf, but I didn't have it, and.
[02:15:46.300 --> 02:15:48.040]  Yeah, you need like a dedicated travel set.
[02:15:48.040 --> 02:15:48.880]  Right.
[02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:49.700]  Of all these things.
[02:15:49.700 --> 02:15:53.220]  But there was one in the house, thankfully, shockingly.
[02:15:53.220 --> 02:15:54.060]  No thanks to me.
[02:15:54.060 --> 02:15:55.700]  Right.
[02:15:55.700 --> 02:15:58.340]  But somebody else had one, so problem solved.
[02:15:58.340 --> 02:16:00.380]  That was the only thing that we ran into.
[02:16:00.380 --> 02:16:05.380]  You know, I'm the wrong person to ask about it,
[02:16:05.580 --> 02:16:09.000]  because I just don't need it, and even with like,
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:13.540]  I shoot, I still use a Fuji X100S that shoots on an SD card,
[02:16:13.540 --> 02:16:17.380]  and in theory, you know, someday,
[02:16:17.380 --> 02:16:18.660]  instead of waiting until I get home
[02:16:18.660 --> 02:16:20.460]  and going through the photos on my iMac,
[02:16:20.460 --> 02:16:22.340]  I might want to do it on this, but I have,
[02:16:22.340 --> 02:16:27.220]  I do have the SSD to USB-C adapter with me, I think.
[02:16:27.220 --> 02:16:28.980]  Yeah, that weird like SanDisk, like flat one,
[02:16:28.980 --> 02:16:31.580]  I have one of those, it's kind of weird.
[02:16:31.580 --> 02:16:32.980]  I think I have it with me, I don't know,
[02:16:32.980 --> 02:16:36.300]  I do know I own one, but I don't need it on this trip,
[02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:38.100]  so I'm the wrong person to ask about it.
[02:16:38.100 --> 02:16:41.660]  I guess, ATP covers it, I'm assuming that most people
[02:16:41.660 --> 02:16:43.320]  listening to this also listen to ATP,
[02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:44.620]  but you've talked about it, but I do,
[02:16:44.620 --> 02:16:46.860]  I guess the bigger picture thing about the MacBook line
[02:16:46.860 --> 02:16:50.620]  in general is that USB-C has not worked out
[02:16:50.620 --> 02:16:53.580]  the way Apple envisioned, and they don't have to admit it
[02:16:53.580 --> 02:16:55.540]  for us to know that it's true, there's just,
[02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:59.220]  there can be no doubt that this many years, three years
[02:16:59.220 --> 02:17:04.220]  after the 2015 MacBook appeared with only a USB-C port,
[02:17:04.220 --> 02:17:08.600]  it's, three years is way long enough for it to be clear
[02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:11.100]  that it just has not worked out the way they clearly
[02:17:11.100 --> 02:17:14.060]  thought it would, and almost everything you buy
[02:17:14.060 --> 02:17:17.720]  that's USB-C still is USB-A, and when you buy
[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:19.980]  the USB-C stuff, it's all, it doesn't work,
[02:17:19.980 --> 02:17:22.540]  you know, a lot of it is junk.
[02:17:22.540 --> 02:17:25.440]  It's very flaky, like that to me was the biggest problem
[02:17:25.440 --> 02:17:28.620]  when I was using these full-time that I ran into was
[02:17:28.620 --> 02:17:30.340]  a lot of my stuff just, it was unreliable,
[02:17:30.340 --> 02:17:33.460]  like the dongle would be unreliable, or it would work
[02:17:33.460 --> 02:17:36.500]  in a port on the laptop, but not on one of the ports
[02:17:36.500 --> 02:17:39.460]  in the LG Ultrafine monitor, or something like that,
[02:17:39.460 --> 02:17:41.380]  like there was, all these little exceptions,
[02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:43.620]  like well this USB device, like the keyboard dongle
[02:17:43.620 --> 02:17:46.340]  would work in this adapter, but not that adapter,
[02:17:46.340 --> 02:17:49.380]  and it was just so flaky, and it makes it really difficult,
[02:17:49.380 --> 02:17:52.120]  even if you're willing to go all in on USB-C,
[02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:54.380]  you're saying, okay fine, I'll buy all new cables,
[02:17:54.380 --> 02:17:56.140]  I'll buy hubs, whatever I got, whatever I have to buy,
[02:17:56.140 --> 02:17:58.700]  sure, I'll go all in, but the ecosystem still
[02:17:58.700 --> 02:18:00.620]  makes it pretty difficult to do that reliably.
[02:18:00.620 --> 02:18:02.300]  And it's funny, I didn't have any, I haven't had
[02:18:02.300 --> 02:18:04.460]  any incidents with this machine that I've been using
[02:18:04.460 --> 02:18:09.220]  for a week, but about 10 days ago, somewhere around there,
[02:18:09.220 --> 02:18:11.580]  after I was, I talked to Apple, and they were like,
[02:18:11.580 --> 02:18:13.860]  hey, we'll send you a review unit, and I was waiting
[02:18:13.860 --> 02:18:16.700]  for it, and while I was using my other machine,
[02:18:16.700 --> 02:18:21.300]  I had a prototypical mag-safe thing where I was working
[02:18:21.300 --> 02:18:25.620]  with my personal 13-inch on a table I didn't usually,
[02:18:25.620 --> 02:18:28.300]  I forget where I was even, I must not even have been
[02:18:28.300 --> 02:18:30.700]  at home, I was somewhere, working in a weird,
[02:18:30.700 --> 02:18:33.340]  unfamiliar spot, and I stood up, and me personally,
[02:18:33.340 --> 02:18:35.340]  I can't blame anybody else, just totally kicked
[02:18:35.340 --> 02:18:37.580]  the power cord, because I, oop, forgot it was there,
[02:18:37.580 --> 02:18:41.580]  and just, bloop, little perfect mag-safe just came out.
[02:18:41.580 --> 02:18:44.460]  And I, but because it was on my mind that this machine
[02:18:44.460 --> 02:18:46.660]  was coming and I knew I'd be using it, I was like,
[02:18:46.660 --> 02:18:49.820]  wow, I'm glad that happened with this and not with that.
[02:18:49.820 --> 02:18:51.340]  But yeah.
[02:18:51.340 --> 02:18:54.740]  So that's another one that, you know, to add to the list
[02:18:54.740 --> 02:18:57.060]  of things that they've changed that, I see it,
[02:18:57.060 --> 02:18:59.980]  I understand it to some degree, but boy, we've lost,
[02:18:59.980 --> 02:19:02.820]  it's two steps forward and at least one step back,
[02:19:02.820 --> 02:19:06.340]  if not two steps in one good direction and two entire
[02:19:06.340 --> 02:19:07.740]  steps in a bad direction.
[02:19:07.740 --> 02:19:09.140]  Do you miss the other things that have changed
[02:19:09.140 --> 02:19:12.480]  about the power being like, no longer having the little
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:15.020]  wings and the power brick and not having the light
[02:19:15.020 --> 02:19:16.340]  on the end of it?
[02:19:16.340 --> 02:19:18.300]  I miss both of those things tremendously.
[02:19:18.300 --> 02:19:19.280]  Yeah, me too.
[02:19:19.280 --> 02:19:21.340]  Just because, especially when you travel,
[02:19:22.700 --> 02:19:24.420]  there's unfamiliar ports in the one.
[02:19:24.420 --> 02:19:28.420]  You never know when your, you know, hotel, it's unusual,
[02:19:28.420 --> 02:19:29.980]  but you know, when you travel to somebody's house,
[02:19:29.980 --> 02:19:33.580]  who knows which adapters or plugs in the wall
[02:19:33.580 --> 02:19:35.820]  are hooked up to a light switch or not.
[02:19:35.820 --> 02:19:36.740]  Oh yeah.
[02:19:36.740 --> 02:19:37.580]  Right, it's.
[02:19:37.580 --> 02:19:39.620]  Or like if you accidentally, if it like, if you have like
[02:19:39.620 --> 02:19:41.840]  one of the like old, like loose outlets and your bricks
[02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:44.500]  has slid out from it a little bit, you kind of don't know.
[02:19:44.500 --> 02:19:47.620]  Right, I'm addicted to the confirmation, you know,
[02:19:47.620 --> 02:19:50.340]  like in a way that an iPhone, if you plug it into power
[02:19:50.340 --> 02:19:52.820]  and it is getting power, it'll, the screen will always
[02:19:52.820 --> 02:19:55.540]  come on and just show you a little green lightning,
[02:19:55.540 --> 02:19:57.620]  like okay, I'm getting some juice and then you can
[02:19:57.620 --> 02:19:58.580]  just walk away.
[02:19:58.580 --> 02:20:01.900]  When you have a clamshell closed MacBook and you plug it
[02:20:01.900 --> 02:20:04.700]  into power and you assume that when you come back
[02:20:04.700 --> 02:20:07.300]  from dinner or when you wake up in a more, whatever,
[02:20:07.300 --> 02:20:09.500]  you know, whatever the period is, that this will be
[02:20:09.500 --> 02:20:12.140]  nice and charged, you know, I want to know it.
[02:20:12.140 --> 02:20:13.260]  I want to see that green light.
[02:20:13.260 --> 02:20:14.580]  I miss that terribly.
[02:20:14.580 --> 02:20:16.340]  Because it just, it makes the little sound,
[02:20:16.340 --> 02:20:18.580]  but only if it's not muted.
[02:20:18.580 --> 02:20:20.140]  And also, you might not be able to hear the sound
[02:20:20.140 --> 02:20:21.580]  depending on the environment.
[02:20:21.580 --> 02:20:24.960]  And you also, there's no way to glance at it
[02:20:24.960 --> 02:20:26.620]  from across the room and see, is it charging
[02:20:26.620 --> 02:20:27.540]  or is it charged?
[02:20:27.540 --> 02:20:30.260]  Right, yeah, and the wings on the adapter,
[02:20:30.260 --> 02:20:32.740]  I complained about that in my review in 2016
[02:20:32.740 --> 02:20:36.420]  and it still stands because I, it was a great design
[02:20:36.420 --> 02:20:37.820]  and I use them all the time.
[02:20:37.820 --> 02:20:39.380]  I mean, there might be people who don't know it
[02:20:39.380 --> 02:20:41.000]  because it is a weird little thing, but if you have
[02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:44.420]  an older MacBook power adapter and those two little
[02:20:44.420 --> 02:20:47.180]  plastic, I can't think of anything better to call it
[02:20:47.180 --> 02:20:49.220]  than wings that pull out on the one side,
[02:20:49.220 --> 02:20:51.620]  they're meant for you to wrap the skinny part
[02:20:51.620 --> 02:20:53.100]  of the power adapter around.
[02:20:53.100 --> 02:20:57.260]  And they are absolutely amazing, they do the job
[02:20:57.260 --> 02:20:59.100]  better than anything I could imagine, other than
[02:20:59.100 --> 02:21:01.120]  if it could actually, like, retract.
[02:21:01.120 --> 02:21:01.960]  Yeah, that would be better.
[02:21:01.960 --> 02:21:02.780]  Right.
[02:21:02.780 --> 02:21:04.280]  But I can't see Apple doing that.
[02:21:04.280 --> 02:21:05.940]  Right, because they'd have to make it bigger.
[02:21:05.940 --> 02:21:07.860]  And also, it's kind of like a crappy, it's kind of
[02:21:07.860 --> 02:21:10.620]  like a low class mechanism to have a little
[02:21:10.620 --> 02:21:13.220]  retracty thing, but I actually would kind of like that.
[02:21:13.220 --> 02:21:15.300]  But yeah, the new ones, I feel like when I'm carrying
[02:21:15.300 --> 02:21:18.140]  them around, I have this, like, mess of power cable
[02:21:18.140 --> 02:21:20.120]  in the bag, no matter how nicely I try to wrap it up.
[02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:22.020]  It's just like, it's nothing compared to having
[02:21:22.020 --> 02:21:24.420]  the old brick just where I wrap it around the brick
[02:21:24.420 --> 02:21:26.300]  and have it hold there and have it, you know,
[02:21:26.300 --> 02:21:28.700]  all nice and compact and organized.
[02:21:28.700 --> 02:21:29.940]  All right, let me take one last break here.
[02:21:29.940 --> 02:21:32.860]  I've got a fourth bonus sponsor for this extra long
[02:21:32.860 --> 02:21:35.220]  special edition of the show, and it's our good friends
[02:21:35.220 --> 02:21:36.380]  at Squarespace.
[02:21:37.220 --> 02:21:41.100]  Squarespace is where you go to make your own website.
[02:21:41.100 --> 02:21:42.560]  And this has come up, maybe we'll talk about it
[02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:46.180]  after this break briefly, but there's been people
[02:21:46.180 --> 02:21:50.500]  talking about just the way, like, centralized
[02:21:50.500 --> 02:21:53.740]  podcast hosting and, you know, what should you do,
[02:21:53.740 --> 02:21:55.860]  you know, should all podcasts, should there be like
[02:21:55.860 --> 02:21:58.080]  a YouTube for podcasts, that sort of thing.
[02:21:59.340 --> 02:22:02.500]  I'll tell you what, if you care about your online presence
[02:22:02.500 --> 02:22:05.420]  and whether you're a company, whether you're just
[02:22:05.420 --> 02:22:07.020]  an individual, whether you've got a portfolio
[02:22:07.020 --> 02:22:08.940]  or something like that, of course you have to participate
[02:22:08.940 --> 02:22:10.480]  in certain social networks and some of them
[02:22:10.480 --> 02:22:13.140]  are centralized, but you should own your own
[02:22:13.140 --> 02:22:14.300]  personal website.
[02:22:14.300 --> 02:22:18.620]  Nothing can beat it for permanence and independence.
[02:22:20.220 --> 02:22:23.140]  And you don't have to worry, like if, you know,
[02:22:23.140 --> 02:22:25.540]  you had a big MySpace presence or something like that
[02:22:25.540 --> 02:22:27.360]  and all of a sudden MySpace goes away,
[02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:28.420]  now you got nothing.
[02:22:28.420 --> 02:22:30.100]  Like, nobody can take your website away.
[02:22:30.100 --> 02:22:33.720]  And if you need your own website, there is no easier,
[02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:38.720]  more reliable, just all round, excellent, low friction,
[02:22:38.720 --> 02:22:41.200]  don't worry about it.
[02:22:41.200 --> 02:22:43.400]  Like, if the whole point of, ah, just do everything
[02:22:43.400 --> 02:22:46.080]  on Facebook or whatever, is that you don't wanna do
[02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:48.000]  all the work of creating your own website.
[02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.720]  Squarespace makes it so easy.
[02:22:50.720 --> 02:22:53.440]  It is as easy as configuring your profile
[02:22:53.440 --> 02:22:56.320]  on like a social network type thing to just create
[02:22:56.320 --> 02:23:00.720]  your entire custom own website with your own domain.
[02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:02.520]  Everything you can do through Squarespace,
[02:23:02.520 --> 02:23:05.400]  from registering a domain, to picking the template,
[02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:08.360]  to adjusting the template, to deciding what style
[02:23:08.360 --> 02:23:10.320]  of, you know, what features you want.
[02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:11.400]  Do you need a store?
[02:23:11.400 --> 02:23:12.640]  Do you wanna host a blog?
[02:23:12.640 --> 02:23:14.540]  Do you wanna host a podcast?
[02:23:15.560 --> 02:23:18.300]  All of this, and so you can do all of that on Squarespace.
[02:23:18.300 --> 02:23:20.320]  And you don't need any coding experience.
[02:23:20.320 --> 02:23:22.240]  You don't have to ever look at HTML.
[02:23:22.240 --> 02:23:23.360]  You don't have to look at CSS.
[02:23:23.360 --> 02:23:26.500]  You don't even have to know what JavaScript is.
[02:23:26.500 --> 02:23:27.460]  None of that.
[02:23:27.460 --> 02:23:28.500]  You get everything.
[02:23:28.500 --> 02:23:29.720]  You get analytics.
[02:23:29.720 --> 02:23:32.060]  You can find out who's coming to your website from where,
[02:23:32.060 --> 02:23:35.440]  and it's a really good analytics interface.
[02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:38.360]  Most analytics interfaces are inscrutable.
[02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:40.320]  Squarespace, like almost everything they do,
[02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:45.000]  is obviously designed by talented designers
[02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:46.400]  who know information design.
[02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:48.100]  The analytics thing is worth it alone.
[02:23:48.100 --> 02:23:49.880]  It is so amazing.
[02:23:49.880 --> 02:23:51.880]  You would be shocked if you do view source
[02:23:51.880 --> 02:23:53.520]  on websites you go to every day,
[02:23:53.520 --> 02:23:55.680]  like restaurants, things like that.
[02:23:55.680 --> 02:23:58.300]  How many of the websites you use on a daily basis
[02:23:58.300 --> 02:24:01.560]  are hosted and built on the Squarespace platform?
[02:24:01.560 --> 02:24:03.920]  They're everywhere, and with good reason.
[02:24:03.920 --> 02:24:05.760]  It's truly amazing.
[02:24:05.760 --> 02:24:08.800]  Marco always says it when he talks about Squarespace on ATP,
[02:24:08.800 --> 02:24:10.600]  but the next time you think you need a website
[02:24:10.600 --> 02:24:13.280]  or someone you know needs a website and they come to you,
[02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:17.520]  try it at Squarespace first and just give it a half hour,
[02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:19.360]  give it an hour, and see how far you can go.
[02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:21.300]  And you will think, my God, this is nuts
[02:24:21.300 --> 02:24:22.840]  that I ever did this any other way.
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:25.760]  They have amazing technical support, everything you can want.
[02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:28.420]  I can't think of anything else that you would want.
[02:24:28.420 --> 02:24:31.080]  So go to Squarespace the next time you need a website.
[02:24:31.080 --> 02:24:32.220]  And here's the deal.
[02:24:32.220 --> 02:24:37.220]  You get 30 days free to just use it, it's full featured.
[02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:39.640]  You don't have to pay them anything.
[02:24:39.640 --> 02:24:42.400]  So when you do pay, just remember this,
[02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:44.880]  remember the code talk show.
[02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:47.640]  If you want, you could even use the code ATP.
[02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:51.520]  Either way, you're gonna get 10% off your first purchase,
[02:24:52.780 --> 02:24:55.000]  and they'll know where it came from.
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:56.560]  None of these two great shows.
[02:24:56.560 --> 02:24:59.320]  Squarespace.com slash talk show is where you go,
[02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:01.960]  and that code, which you remember when you start paying,
[02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:02.840]  is talk show.
[02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:05.040]  You could also use ATP if you're here for Marco
[02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:06.160]  and not for me.
[02:25:06.160 --> 02:25:08.000]  Either way, it's a great product.
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.520]  Again, anybody comes to me, whether they sponsor or not,
[02:25:10.520 --> 02:25:12.420]  privately, and says, hey, I need a website.
[02:25:12.420 --> 02:25:14.560]  I send them to Squarespace, I really do.
[02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:17.620]  So my thanks to them for their continuing support
[02:25:17.620 --> 02:25:20.720]  of this show and obviously many other fine podcasts.
[02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:26.040]  Last but not least on this new thing,
[02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:29.800]  Apple gave me the leather sleeve that goes with it.
[02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:32.240]  They've started, this is new to the MacBook Pros.
[02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:35.300]  They've made leather cases for iPhones for years.
[02:25:35.300 --> 02:25:40.300]  They've made leather sleeves for the iPad for a year.
[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:41.240]  Something like that.
[02:25:41.240 --> 02:25:43.760]  Yeah, and now, starting about two weeks ago
[02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:45.080]  when these new MacBook Pros come out,
[02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:47.500]  they have leather sleeves for them.
[02:25:47.500 --> 02:25:48.340]  It's 180.
[02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:52.280]  You can't even get to the price.
[02:25:52.280 --> 02:25:56.020]  It's $180 for the 13-inch model,
[02:25:56.020 --> 02:26:00.400]  and $200 for the 15-inch model.
[02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:03.400]  And it's just a sleeve.
[02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:05.000]  It is leather.
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:05.980]  They sent me the black one.
[02:26:05.980 --> 02:26:06.880]  It is nice.
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:09.340]  I don't know what material it is inside,
[02:26:09.340 --> 02:26:11.920]  but some kind of microfiber type thing, very soft.
[02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:13.680]  Has a very subtle Apple logo on it.
[02:26:15.480 --> 02:26:19.080]  I do use a sleeve type thing with my 13-inch MacBook Pro.
[02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:21.360]  I forget what brand it is,
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:22.800]  but it's sort of like a padded thing
[02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:26.000]  because I use a backpack that doesn't have a padded area
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:30.080]  for a laptop, but it is more than just a sleeve.
[02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:31.680]  It's padded, it has a zipper,
[02:26:31.680 --> 02:26:33.320]  and it has a zipper compartment
[02:26:33.320 --> 02:26:36.840]  where I keep a bunch of certain essential things
[02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:38.560]  that I wanna have with me at all times.
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:41.800]  I personally have no interest in a sleeve
[02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:44.040]  of any sort, leather or not,
[02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:48.340]  that doesn't have a compartment that I can do things in
[02:26:48.340 --> 02:26:51.380]  because if I don't need anything else with me,
[02:26:51.380 --> 02:26:56.380]  I would just take the bare MacBook.
[02:26:56.800 --> 02:26:59.680]  I showed it to my wife, Amy, who knows,
[02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:04.680]  has experience and more opinions on fine leather goods
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:07.720]  like handbags, that sort of thing,
[02:27:07.720 --> 02:27:10.000]  wallets and things like that, than I do,
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.080]  and I showed it to her, and she knew what it was,
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:15.200]  and I just said, how much do you think this costs?
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:19.680]  And she felt it, took a couple seconds looking at it
[02:27:19.680 --> 02:27:22.200]  and just rubbed the leather, and she said,
[02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:24.040]  and I think this was her including
[02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:26.300]  what she perceived to be Apple's premium pricing,
[02:27:26.300 --> 02:27:31.300]  she said, $60, and I said, it's 200,
[02:27:31.440 --> 02:27:36.120]  and we were in the kitchen, and she yelled, no!
[02:27:36.120 --> 02:27:41.120]  So loud that our son Jonas, who's on summer vacation,
[02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:44.840]  he's upstairs, and his bedroom's right above our kitchen,
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:47.360]  he thought, and he's used to it every once in a while,
[02:27:47.360 --> 02:27:49.480]  that she'll discover that, let's say he left
[02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:52.440]  like an empty bag of chips on the table or something,
[02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:54.960]  did some kind of gross violation of family protocol,
[02:27:54.960 --> 02:27:57.520]  she'll yell, Joe!
[02:27:58.880 --> 02:28:01.720]  Or even if she yells, Jonas!
[02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:03.840]  That first syllable is what he hears,
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:07.560]  so she yelled, no, and Jonas goes, I'm coming!
[02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:19.960]  So I would summarize her reaction to it as it being not worth $200.
[02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:21.800]  That seems like a fair summary.
[02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:23.840]  It is possible, I don't know.
[02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:26.800]  It is possible that the reason,
[02:28:26.800 --> 02:28:29.440]  her thought is that this is not high quality leather.
[02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:31.800]  It is possible, though, that she's comparing it
[02:28:31.800 --> 02:28:34.440]  against something like a nice handbag,
[02:28:34.440 --> 02:28:38.760]  which has, maybe this is treated for water resistance
[02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:42.720]  or something that makes it less supple and undesirable
[02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:45.160]  for something like that and more desirable for this.
[02:28:45.160 --> 02:28:46.440]  I don't know.
[02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:49.280]  But the person in our household who has stronger opinions
[02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:53.280]  on leather bags definitely was not impressed
[02:28:53.280 --> 02:28:55.400]  by the $200 price point.
[02:28:55.400 --> 02:29:00.040]  Yeah, I was able to feel one of these as well.
[02:29:00.040 --> 02:29:01.360]  Well, I've got mine here.
[02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:02.760]  Yeah, I wasn't sure if you were allowed
[02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:04.320]  to share your review unit with other people.
[02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:05.160]  I was at your family.
[02:29:05.160 --> 02:29:07.040]  Oh, yes, yeah, there's no embargo on it.
[02:29:07.040 --> 02:29:08.880]  But, yeah, but suffice to say,
[02:29:08.880 --> 02:29:11.840]  I was able to experience one of these products.
[02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:14.200]  Did you type on his keyboard yet?
[02:29:14.200 --> 02:29:15.640]  Ah, briefly, I think.
[02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:16.480]  You wanna play with it?
[02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:17.320]  Let me see.
[02:29:17.320 --> 02:29:18.160]  Let me see.
[02:29:21.520 --> 02:29:23.600]  That's just the end of the Apple Note with the show notes.
[02:29:23.600 --> 02:29:25.240]  So you can type whatever you want.
[02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:28.880]  Yeah, anyway, so I was able, this feels,
[02:29:30.360 --> 02:29:34.040]  it feels slightly stickier than the old one.
[02:29:34.040 --> 02:29:37.160]  Like, it feels like the keys,
[02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:38.320]  it feels like they're like,
[02:29:38.320 --> 02:29:41.400]  they don't pop back like as readily as the other ones,
[02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:42.600]  but not by a huge margin.
[02:29:42.600 --> 02:29:44.920]  It's a small, I'll have to really just use mine for a while
[02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:45.760]  if they really know.
[02:29:45.760 --> 02:29:47.480]  Yeah, the silicone layer definitely adds
[02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:49.840]  a sort of organic feel that's not there
[02:29:49.840 --> 02:29:52.720]  from a purely, I don't know if these words
[02:29:52.720 --> 02:29:55.560]  quite make sense, but without the silicone layer
[02:29:55.560 --> 02:29:57.520]  where it's purely mechanical,
[02:29:57.520 --> 02:30:00.440]  everything involved is either metal or plastic,
[02:30:01.560 --> 02:30:03.160]  there's a mechanicalness to the feel,
[02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:07.400]  and the silicone layer adds an organic feel to it
[02:30:07.400 --> 02:30:09.400]  that I find pleasing, but.
[02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:12.560]  Yeah, I'll have to save time with it, but.
[02:30:12.560 --> 02:30:14.760]  Yeah, so the leather thing, I think,
[02:30:14.760 --> 02:30:18.520]  if you're familiar with their leather cases for iPhones,
[02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:19.520]  it's nothing like that.
[02:30:19.520 --> 02:30:21.200]  If you're familiar with the leather case
[02:30:21.200 --> 02:30:22.880]  they made for iPad that we mentioned earlier,
[02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:24.200]  it's really nothing like that either.
[02:30:24.200 --> 02:30:25.720]  Like, that's what I was kind of expecting.
[02:30:25.720 --> 02:30:27.840]  The iPad case is, it's a much thicker,
[02:30:27.840 --> 02:30:30.120]  more supple, more soft leather.
[02:30:30.120 --> 02:30:34.600]  The MacBook Pro leather case barely feels like leather.
[02:30:34.600 --> 02:30:37.640]  It feels more like a plastic composite kind of thing.
[02:30:37.640 --> 02:30:38.480]  It does.
[02:30:38.480 --> 02:30:40.560]  Because I think, I'm sure, you know,
[02:30:40.560 --> 02:30:41.960]  if they say it's leather, I'm sure it is,
[02:30:41.960 --> 02:30:43.600]  but I think the leather is,
[02:30:43.600 --> 02:30:46.040]  it's probably a very, very thin layer of leather
[02:30:46.040 --> 02:30:48.960]  because any thicker leather layer
[02:30:48.960 --> 02:30:51.600]  would probably be pretty bulky and heavy at that size.
[02:30:51.600 --> 02:30:55.400]  But regardless, the iPad one I think feels pretty good
[02:30:55.400 --> 02:30:56.640]  and provides a nice utility of having
[02:30:56.640 --> 02:30:58.640]  that pencil pocket for the Apple Pencil.
[02:30:58.640 --> 02:31:03.400]  So this does not offer any, neither the good feel
[02:31:03.400 --> 02:31:04.920]  nor the additional utility of a pocket.
[02:31:04.920 --> 02:31:08.320]  Yeah, if you came to me without telling me it was leather
[02:31:08.320 --> 02:31:10.080]  and said, do you think this is leather or not,
[02:31:10.080 --> 02:31:11.760]  I think I might even guess no.
[02:31:11.760 --> 02:31:14.240]  I have, what's that material that Microsoft started using
[02:31:14.240 --> 02:31:15.720]  and they use in the inside of cars?
[02:31:15.720 --> 02:31:16.560]  Acotera?
[02:31:16.560 --> 02:31:17.400]  Acotera.
[02:31:17.400 --> 02:31:19.320]  I might, I would think like,
[02:31:19.320 --> 02:31:21.200]  maybe what's that stuff that Microsoft,
[02:31:21.200 --> 02:31:23.280]  I would say the same thing and you'd say Acotera.
[02:31:23.280 --> 02:31:25.640]  I'll bet this is Acotera or something.
[02:31:25.640 --> 02:31:26.480]  You know?
[02:31:26.480 --> 02:31:27.300]  Yeah, I mean, it's not,
[02:31:27.300 --> 02:31:28.140]  because it doesn't feel cloth-like.
[02:31:28.140 --> 02:31:30.200]  It feels like plastic gear or rubber,
[02:31:30.200 --> 02:31:33.280]  because it just, it feels like a very thin,
[02:31:33.280 --> 02:31:36.080]  like fake leather basically, because it just,
[02:31:36.080 --> 02:31:37.840]  again, whatever the reasons were,
[02:31:37.840 --> 02:31:39.640]  whether it was cost, probably not.
[02:31:39.640 --> 02:31:42.520]  It was probably like thickness and weight at that size.
[02:31:42.520 --> 02:31:43.600]  It just doesn't feel good.
[02:31:43.600 --> 02:31:48.000]  I would, if you are a laptop sleeve person,
[02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:48.840]  which I've never been,
[02:31:48.840 --> 02:31:50.080]  so I don't really know the market that well,
[02:31:50.080 --> 02:31:53.140]  but if you are, I imagine the reason
[02:31:53.140 --> 02:31:55.080]  you would get a laptop sleeve would be what you said,
[02:31:55.080 --> 02:31:56.880]  because like if you're putting it in a bag
[02:31:56.880 --> 02:31:58.240]  that does not have a padded compartment,
[02:31:58.240 --> 02:31:59.360]  you want like some padding
[02:31:59.360 --> 02:32:00.600]  or you want like a dedicated thing,
[02:32:00.600 --> 02:32:02.720]  so other stuff in the same compartment
[02:32:02.720 --> 02:32:05.040]  doesn't scratch it up or something like that,
[02:32:05.040 --> 02:32:08.560]  this can provide some of that,
[02:32:08.560 --> 02:32:10.620]  but pretty much no other value.
[02:32:10.620 --> 02:32:12.520]  It doesn't provide, it doesn't give you a nice feel.
[02:32:12.520 --> 02:32:14.800]  It doesn't, I didn't think it looked very good either,
[02:32:14.800 --> 02:32:18.720]  and it, I just, I don't see why you'd want it to honestly.
[02:32:18.720 --> 02:32:22.240]  Even the Syracuse types who want
[02:32:22.240 --> 02:32:25.720]  to fanatically maintain the exterior
[02:32:25.720 --> 02:32:29.080]  as close to mint condition as they can,
[02:32:29.080 --> 02:32:31.560]  avoiding any and all fine, quote unquote,
[02:32:31.560 --> 02:32:33.160]  micro abrasions, et cetera,
[02:32:33.160 --> 02:32:34.880]  I think the fact that it doesn't zip shut
[02:32:34.880 --> 02:32:36.060]  would be unappealing to them.
[02:32:36.060 --> 02:32:38.160]  Like I can't see, even if Syracuse,
[02:32:38.160 --> 02:32:42.120]  even if, you know, $200, which I can't see him buying,
[02:32:42.120 --> 02:32:45.320]  I cannot see John buying a $200 leather sleeve,
[02:32:46.400 --> 02:32:48.540]  but even if it was free, I don't think he would use it,
[02:32:48.540 --> 02:32:50.600]  because I don't think it would satisfy his,
[02:32:50.600 --> 02:32:53.080]  I need to feel like I can throw this anywhere
[02:32:53.080 --> 02:32:55.960]  and it's never gonna come into contact with anything,
[02:32:55.960 --> 02:32:57.500]  because it's got an open end.
[02:32:57.500 --> 02:32:59.280]  Not to mention, if you're putting stuff in and out of it,
[02:32:59.280 --> 02:33:00.960]  it's gonna get scratched from grit.
[02:33:00.960 --> 02:33:01.800]  Right.
[02:33:01.800 --> 02:33:03.200]  You know, and especially because there's the open end,
[02:33:03.200 --> 02:33:05.480]  then when the laptop is not in it, or even when it is.
[02:33:05.480 --> 02:33:07.320]  And it's a very snug fit, right?
[02:33:07.320 --> 02:33:08.160]  Yeah.
[02:33:08.160 --> 02:33:08.980]  So if any kind of grit got in there,
[02:33:08.980 --> 02:33:11.400]  it's not easy to get in, I mean, not hard either,
[02:33:11.400 --> 02:33:14.360]  but it is sort of like, you know, it's like,
[02:33:15.240 --> 02:33:19.000]  you know, like when you just put a check in an envelope,
[02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.720]  it just, you know, it's nice and easy,
[02:33:21.720 --> 02:33:25.080]  because the envelope is way bigger than the check.
[02:33:25.080 --> 02:33:27.200]  But when you put a greeting card
[02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:29.440]  in the greeting card envelope, it's-
[02:33:29.440 --> 02:33:30.280]  You gotta like shimmy it in.
[02:33:30.280 --> 02:33:31.200]  Yeah, you gotta shimmy it in.
[02:33:31.200 --> 02:33:32.320]  That's exactly what it's like.
[02:33:32.320 --> 02:33:35.360]  This is like, when I put my 13-inch MacBook
[02:33:35.360 --> 02:33:37.040]  in my padded case up there,
[02:33:37.040 --> 02:33:38.540]  it's like putting a check in an envelope.
[02:33:38.540 --> 02:33:39.740]  It just goes in and out.
[02:33:39.740 --> 02:33:41.260]  When I put this in the leather sleeve,
[02:33:41.260 --> 02:33:43.640]  it's like putting a birthday card into the envelope.
[02:33:43.640 --> 02:33:45.680]  And it's like, you've got this envelope
[02:33:45.680 --> 02:33:50.680]  that is exactly 1 16th of an inch bigger than the card.
[02:33:50.680 --> 02:33:54.260]  Yeah, I'm guessing that after this trip
[02:33:54.260 --> 02:33:56.000]  of you having this one here,
[02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:57.620]  I'm guessing I never see another one
[02:33:57.620 --> 02:33:58.960]  of these in the wild again.
[02:34:00.240 --> 02:34:01.080]  Oh, the sleeve?
[02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:02.240]  Yeah, I can't imagine.
[02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:04.380]  Because I can't, I don't, it just doesn't seem
[02:34:04.380 --> 02:34:06.480]  like anything that would appeal to our friends.
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:08.800]  I mean, it might, well, I wonder.
[02:34:08.800 --> 02:34:10.720]  I don't, it just does not seem like an idea
[02:34:10.720 --> 02:34:12.680]  that has legs, you know.
[02:34:12.680 --> 02:34:15.480]  I think it requires different execution
[02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:16.840]  than what they've done here.
[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:19.240]  It requires, if you're gonna have something that size
[02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:21.300]  and that high market, it's gonna need to be better leather.
[02:34:21.300 --> 02:34:22.260]  It's gonna need to feel better.
[02:34:22.260 --> 02:34:23.760]  It's gonna need to be more supple.
[02:34:23.760 --> 02:34:26.160]  It's probably gonna need like an exterior pocket
[02:34:26.160 --> 02:34:28.700]  or something, like just some additional utility
[02:34:28.700 --> 02:34:29.960]  in addition to nicer grade leather.
[02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:34.400]  And it also seems like almost most people, typical people,
[02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:36.440]  don't wanna spend a lot on our case.
[02:34:36.440 --> 02:34:38.600]  And most people, you know, the whole side thing
[02:34:38.600 --> 02:34:41.320]  we can go on about how at least seemingly
[02:34:41.320 --> 02:34:44.720]  98% of iPhone users use a case.
[02:34:44.720 --> 02:34:46.080]  We live in dark times.
[02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:47.960]  But almost nobody, I see almost nobody
[02:34:47.960 --> 02:34:49.840]  in the real world with an Apple case.
[02:34:49.840 --> 02:34:51.200]  It's almost all third party.
[02:34:51.200 --> 02:34:53.200]  And I guess part of that is, you know,
[02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:55.240]  the way that people express their individualism
[02:34:55.240 --> 02:34:57.080]  and you see all sorts of, you know,
[02:34:58.040 --> 02:35:01.200]  just thousands, literally thousands of different designs
[02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:04.520]  in the iPhone cases as you walk around, you know,
[02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:06.160]  like a mall or an airport and you see people
[02:35:06.160 --> 02:35:07.800]  at Disney World and you see all these iPhones
[02:35:07.800 --> 02:35:08.800]  out taking cameras.
[02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:11.920]  You could go all day and never see the same case twice.
[02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:14.560]  But I very seldom see people using Apple cases.
[02:35:14.560 --> 02:35:17.720]  But when we're together, like at WWDC
[02:35:17.720 --> 02:35:19.560]  and our group of friends are together,
[02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:21.520]  among the people who use a case on their phone,
[02:35:21.520 --> 02:35:23.360]  we also see a disproportionate number of people
[02:35:23.360 --> 02:35:24.840]  like me who don't use a case.
[02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:27.200]  But we also see, I also notice clearly
[02:35:27.200 --> 02:35:28.520]  a disproportionate number of people
[02:35:28.520 --> 02:35:30.400]  who use the Apple case.
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:32.760]  And I think part of it, I think the biggest part
[02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:37.720]  is that we're, us, me, you, we're the sort of people
[02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:40.440]  like, you know, Casey List, I think uses
[02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:45.440]  an Apple leather case, willing to spend $59
[02:35:45.440 --> 02:35:47.600]  on a case for the iPhone because we really,
[02:35:47.600 --> 02:35:49.200]  really like the way it feels.
[02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:50.800]  The Apple leather case for the phone is really nice.
[02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:52.960]  I'm using one now because normally I'm case-less,
[02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:54.920]  but during the summertime, it like slides
[02:35:54.920 --> 02:35:56.720]  out of my shorts pockets when I'm sitting down,
[02:35:56.720 --> 02:35:57.560]  like every time I sit down.
[02:35:57.560 --> 02:36:00.080]  So I really like the Apple leather case.
[02:36:00.080 --> 02:36:01.640]  They've always been really nice.
[02:36:01.640 --> 02:36:04.920]  And sweaty, the last few years of iPhone designs
[02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:07.000]  have been very, very poor for sweaty hands
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:08.080]  and humid weather.
[02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:10.120]  And I don't have one on right now,
[02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:12.320]  but I actually packed one in my bag for this trip
[02:36:12.320 --> 02:36:14.920]  out of thinking like, if my phone starts feeling slippery,
[02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:16.280]  I'm gonna put it in that case.
[02:36:16.280 --> 02:36:17.600]  And I like the way the leather feels.
[02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:20.360]  And I love the way that the buttons still feel
[02:36:20.360 --> 02:36:23.020]  like actual buttons and not like I'm pushing
[02:36:23.020 --> 02:36:25.040]  the outline of a button on a case
[02:36:25.040 --> 02:36:26.520]  that is pushing a button on the case.
[02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:28.160]  It feels like I'm still pushing a button.
[02:36:28.160 --> 02:36:29.760]  Yeah, a couple years ago when they,
[02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:31.920]  I think it was the 6S generation,
[02:36:31.920 --> 02:36:33.640]  where they switched the buttons on the case
[02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:35.320]  from just like dimples in the leather
[02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:37.480]  to actual like additional metal buttons
[02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:40.260]  that made a huge difference in how it feels.
[02:36:41.660 --> 02:36:43.720]  So I don't, but I don't see that happening.
[02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:46.080]  So I think Apple does very, very,
[02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:48.000]  I even know the majority of people
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.060]  with iPhone cases don't buy the Apple case.
[02:36:50.060 --> 02:36:51.740]  I still think Apple sells enough of the cases
[02:36:51.740 --> 02:36:53.360]  that it's a very, very successful
[02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:55.320]  little accessory business for them.
[02:36:55.320 --> 02:36:58.720]  I don't anticipate the leather sleeve being one.
[02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:01.400]  Because I feel like some people want a sleeve
[02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:03.840]  and they want a pocket and they wanna carry
[02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:04.680]  other stuff in it.
[02:37:04.680 --> 02:37:06.600]  Other people want a sleeve and they just want
[02:37:06.600 --> 02:37:09.000]  something cheap to protect the laptop.
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.200]  And I don't think anybody who really likes
[02:37:11.200 --> 02:37:12.960]  fine leather goods and is willing to spend
[02:37:12.960 --> 02:37:15.520]  a premium for it is gonna like the feel of this case.
[02:37:15.520 --> 02:37:17.080]  I don't see who the market is.
[02:37:17.080 --> 02:37:19.160]  Yeah, and I think we've probably spent
[02:37:19.160 --> 02:37:21.400]  more time talking about it than anybody else ever will.
[02:37:21.400 --> 02:37:25.800]  This is your go-to podcast for discussion
[02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:29.880]  of Apple's $200 leather sleeve for the MacBook Pro.
[02:37:29.880 --> 02:37:32.320]  Do you think any of the Apple executives
[02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:34.280]  that are on like the leadership page on the site,
[02:37:34.280 --> 02:37:37.200]  so like the SVP level, the C level,
[02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:38.880]  do you think any of them have talked about this
[02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:41.400]  for this long with anybody?
[02:37:41.400 --> 02:37:42.920]  I wonder, I don't think so.
[02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:44.040]  I'm guessing not.
[02:37:45.640 --> 02:37:47.080]  I suspect the one who would have the strong,
[02:37:47.080 --> 02:37:49.000]  the two who would have the strongest opinion
[02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.720]  would be Angela Ahrendts, because she certainly
[02:37:51.720 --> 02:37:56.240]  knows her fine leather goods after having been
[02:37:56.240 --> 02:38:01.240]  CEO of Burberry and her experience in the clothing industry
[02:38:01.960 --> 02:38:04.600]  and fashion, whatever you'd like to describe
[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:06.520]  her pre-Apple career as.
[02:38:06.520 --> 02:38:08.880]  And then maybe Schiller, just because Schiller
[02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:10.040]  cares about everything.
[02:38:10.040 --> 02:38:13.320]  But I can't see Schiller using one.
[02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:17.200]  I just, I don't know.
[02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:19.000]  Well, an Apple person would never be seen
[02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:20.240]  using one of these cases.
[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:22.400]  Like the same reason they always carry their iPhones
[02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:26.360]  without cases, like that famous press Q&A
[02:38:26.360 --> 02:38:29.200]  where Steve, Phil, and Tim were up on stage.
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:30.800]  And I'm the one who asked the question.
[02:38:30.800 --> 02:38:31.640]  Oh, that was you?
[02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:32.460]  Yeah.
[02:38:32.460 --> 02:38:33.300]  Oh, that's great.
[02:38:33.300 --> 02:38:34.120]  You didn't know that?
[02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:34.960]  I think I forgot.
[02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:35.800]  I think I knew it back then, but I forgot.
[02:38:35.800 --> 02:38:36.880]  For those who don't know, when they held
[02:38:36.880 --> 02:38:40.360]  the special press conference in town hall for Antennagate.
[02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:42.480]  And if you'll recall, it was actually
[02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:44.980]  the Apple's first owned cases.
[02:38:44.980 --> 02:38:47.840]  Like for the original 3G and 3GS,
[02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:49.160]  Apple didn't make any cases.
[02:38:49.160 --> 02:38:52.440]  And when the iPhone 4 came out, they still didn't make cases
[02:38:52.440 --> 02:38:55.400]  because I think Apple was still opposed to the idea
[02:38:55.400 --> 02:38:56.920]  of putting phones in cases.
[02:38:56.920 --> 02:38:59.680]  But they made the quote unquote bumper,
[02:38:59.680 --> 02:39:03.560]  which was meant to be, as designed meant to be protection
[02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:04.740]  so that you could put it face down
[02:39:04.740 --> 02:39:07.280]  and the glass wouldn't hit the surface of the table
[02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:10.240]  and it would offer some sort of shock per, you know.
[02:39:10.240 --> 02:39:12.560]  But it was like a case that left the entire back exposed
[02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:13.560]  along with the front.
[02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:17.440]  It was a case designed by people who clearly hated cases.
[02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:22.440]  Yes, and the flat sides of the sort of rectilinear nature
[02:39:23.180 --> 02:39:26.920]  of the iPhone 4 and 4S design made it very amenable
[02:39:26.920 --> 02:39:27.960]  to that sort of thing.
[02:39:27.960 --> 02:39:30.800]  Like I'm not sure that a bumper would work
[02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:35.280]  with the last few generations of round edge.
[02:39:35.280 --> 02:39:36.120]  I don't think so.
[02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:37.160]  I think it needs to be flat.
[02:39:37.160 --> 02:39:40.560]  But anyway, part of their solution to the publicity
[02:39:40.560 --> 02:39:43.080]  around Antennagate and the attenuation
[02:39:43.080 --> 02:39:46.000]  that some people who were holding their phones wrong
[02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:50.520]  experienced in low signal, low cell signal areas
[02:39:50.520 --> 02:39:52.480]  was okay, we'll make the bumpers free.
[02:39:52.480 --> 02:39:54.480]  Everybody who buys an iPhone 4
[02:39:54.480 --> 02:39:57.300]  can get a Apple bumper for free.
[02:39:57.300 --> 02:40:00.320]  And the bumper completely eliminated the problem
[02:40:00.320 --> 02:40:04.880]  because the whole problem was if your skin bridged a gap
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:07.080]  in the external steel antenna frame,
[02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:08.240]  that's what caused the problem
[02:40:08.240 --> 02:40:10.800]  because your skin would allow a signal
[02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:14.080]  to transfer from one antenna piece to another
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:15.280]  that it shouldn't.
[02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:16.700]  And if you had the bumper on,
[02:40:16.700 --> 02:40:19.440]  then your skin couldn't touch that gap.
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:23.600]  And then they did a Q&A and people, which I think.
[02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:24.440]  That was unheard of.
[02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:26.800]  Oh, I still think it's the last time.
[02:40:26.800 --> 02:40:29.600]  It's the last time I was at a press event
[02:40:29.600 --> 02:40:31.880]  where there was a Q&A and I'd never been at one before.
[02:40:31.880 --> 02:40:35.760]  It was very, happened many more years ago, maybe more often,
[02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:37.320]  but this was truly unusual.
[02:40:38.760 --> 02:40:41.800]  And a couple of the initial questions from other people,
[02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:44.600]  other people in the media seemed to be,
[02:40:44.600 --> 02:40:47.160]  I could sort of see a narrative emerging
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:49.820]  that wasn't, I didn't think was what Apple meant,
[02:40:49.820 --> 02:40:51.440]  but I could tell from the other questions
[02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:54.000]  that other members of the media
[02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:55.280]  were starting to form a narrative
[02:40:55.280 --> 02:40:58.520]  where Apple's answer to this antenna issue
[02:40:58.520 --> 02:41:00.880]  is that everybody, they're gonna give everybody a bumper
[02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:02.560]  and everybody should use it.
[02:41:02.560 --> 02:41:03.720]  Like a software patch almost,
[02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:05.480]  like you should install this.
[02:41:05.480 --> 02:41:07.280]  Right, like to properly use this phone
[02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:08.600]  and maintain a cell signal,
[02:41:08.600 --> 02:41:10.520]  you're gonna put this free bumper on.
[02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:15.040]  And so my question was, and it was Schiller,
[02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:17.680]  well, a guy named Steve Jobs.
[02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:20.240]  Was it Tim also?
[02:41:20.240 --> 02:41:21.880]  No, I don't think it was Tim.
[02:41:21.880 --> 02:41:22.800]  Jaws maybe?
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:24.600]  Nope, I think it might've been,
[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:26.320]  Bob Mansfield was up there.
[02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:28.160]  Oh, okay, I think it was only three of them total,
[02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:29.080]  so that must be it.
[02:41:29.080 --> 02:41:31.560]  I think, I don't think Tim Cook was up there.
[02:41:31.560 --> 02:41:35.280]  So it would've been 2010, it would've been July of 2010.
[02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:37.440]  And I think, I know Schiller and Jobs
[02:41:37.440 --> 02:41:40.300]  and big Bob Mansfield were up there.
[02:41:40.300 --> 02:41:41.140]  And I don't think Tim Cook was,
[02:41:41.140 --> 02:41:42.480]  I think it was just the three.
[02:41:42.480 --> 02:41:43.640]  Four would be too many.
[02:41:43.640 --> 02:41:44.980]  Yeah.
[02:41:44.980 --> 02:41:47.120]  And I raised my hand.
[02:41:47.120 --> 02:41:50.620]  I think it was Jobs who called on me, but he just pointed.
[02:41:50.620 --> 02:41:55.540]  And I said, I think there's video of it,
[02:41:55.540 --> 02:41:56.800]  but I think I just asked,
[02:41:56.800 --> 02:42:00.320]  does everybody need to use,
[02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:03.280]  or I just said, I don't know, I formulated it very well.
[02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:04.240]  I'm usually very poor.
[02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:05.720]  I'm doing a very poor job
[02:42:05.720 --> 02:42:07.640]  of re-grading the question right now.
[02:42:07.640 --> 02:42:10.100]  But I think I just asked, do you guys use a bumper
[02:42:10.100 --> 02:42:12.800]  or do you just carry it without one and have no problem?
[02:42:12.800 --> 02:42:14.280]  And instead of answering the question,
[02:42:14.280 --> 02:42:16.800]  all three had this, without even saying anything.
[02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:17.640]  It was ordinary.
[02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:19.000]  It was like the perfect PR move.
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.680]  They all three reached into their right jeans pocket
[02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:24.800]  and pulled out a naked iPhone 4.
[02:42:24.800 --> 02:42:27.320]  And the crowd laughed, and I was like,
[02:42:27.320 --> 02:42:28.560]  oh, that worked out really well.
[02:42:28.560 --> 02:42:30.440]  I'm really glad I got my question asked.
[02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:31.280]  Yeah.
[02:42:31.280 --> 02:42:35.800]  So yeah, I think it does seem like the official position
[02:42:35.800 --> 02:42:37.880]  that Apple tries to express
[02:42:37.880 --> 02:42:39.720]  in their executives' public appearances
[02:42:39.720 --> 02:42:41.520]  is that you don't need a case for their phones.
[02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:44.660]  Right, and you don't need a leather sleeve
[02:42:44.660 --> 02:42:45.720]  for your MacBook Pro.
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.240]  Well, we've been going on long enough.
[02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:50.100]  This is short for us.
[02:42:50.100 --> 02:42:51.360]  Yeah, it is short for us.
[02:42:52.740 --> 02:42:53.780]  I was gonna go on a whole thing
[02:42:53.780 --> 02:42:55.480]  about this whole podcast hosting thing,
[02:42:55.480 --> 02:42:56.800]  but I don't know that we need to.
[02:42:56.800 --> 02:42:57.640]  Yeah.
[02:42:59.640 --> 02:43:00.480]  I don't know.
[02:43:00.480 --> 02:43:01.300]  You might have opinions.
[02:43:01.300 --> 02:43:02.480]  Do you have any opinions on podcasting?
[02:43:02.480 --> 02:43:04.480]  Never.
[02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:11.400]  How's it going with the watch version of Overcast
[02:43:11.400 --> 02:43:14.120]  now that you can actually play audio in the background?
[02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:15.040]  Can you talk about that?
[02:43:15.040 --> 02:43:16.880]  Yeah, I mean, it's in development still,
[02:43:16.880 --> 02:43:18.920]  but the development version's pretty much done.
[02:43:18.920 --> 02:43:21.080]  I hope to be in beta pretty soon.
[02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:22.580]  And yeah, when this fall,
[02:43:22.580 --> 02:43:25.280]  when watchOS 5 and iOS 12 come out this fall,
[02:43:26.320 --> 02:43:28.520]  Overcast has full standalone watch playback,
[02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:29.360]  and it's great.
[02:43:29.360 --> 02:43:31.040]  It's finally doable.
[02:43:31.040 --> 02:43:34.080]  Apple, the OS finally gives app developers
[02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:37.480]  what we needed to make that compelling at all,
[02:43:37.480 --> 02:43:38.920]  to make it even barely functional at all.
[02:43:38.920 --> 02:43:40.860]  And it turns out it's really great.
[02:43:40.860 --> 02:43:42.360]  I use it all the time now,
[02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:44.880]  and I can't wait to ship it.
[02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:46.940]  Yeah, and it's an interesting combination
[02:43:46.940 --> 02:43:49.000]  of a couple of finalies where,
[02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:50.520]  I mean, and I've been doing this for years
[02:43:50.520 --> 02:43:54.640]  in my sporadic jogging habit
[02:43:54.640 --> 02:43:59.320]  of somehow trying to get by with the least amount of kit
[02:43:59.320 --> 02:44:02.000]  while I can still either listen to music or podcasts.
[02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:03.460]  And I did the thing for a while
[02:44:03.460 --> 02:44:07.880]  where I had the little square iPod Nano
[02:44:07.880 --> 02:44:09.560]  on a, what was it called?
[02:44:09.560 --> 02:44:10.840]  The TikTok wristband?
[02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:12.360]  Oh yeah, like Kickstarter wrist strap for it.
[02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:15.240]  It was like one of the first Kickstarter sensation projects.
[02:44:15.240 --> 02:44:20.240]  It was like a watch band for the square iPod Nano
[02:44:20.240 --> 02:44:22.520]  that in hindsight was humongous as a watch,
[02:44:22.520 --> 02:44:24.040]  but allowed you, it was,
[02:44:24.040 --> 02:44:26.540]  but as Tim Cook famously said before the watch,
[02:44:26.540 --> 02:44:28.280]  the wrist is an interesting place.
[02:44:28.280 --> 02:44:29.680]  And it's an interesting place.
[02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:30.840]  It was always an interesting place
[02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:32.080]  to put a little thing like that
[02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:35.560]  for the reason that it, for over a century now,
[02:44:35.560 --> 02:44:38.560]  has been an interesting place to put a carry-on timepiece.
[02:44:39.940 --> 02:44:42.160]  And the biggest problem with it wasn't the wristband.
[02:44:42.160 --> 02:44:44.160]  It was a fine wristband,
[02:44:44.160 --> 02:44:46.560]  and it wasn't looking at it, which was great.
[02:44:46.560 --> 02:44:47.960]  It was a great place to put it,
[02:44:47.960 --> 02:44:48.800]  because you could see it.
[02:44:48.800 --> 02:44:49.840]  Like when you clipped it on your shirt,
[02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:51.240]  you couldn't really see it.
[02:44:52.520 --> 02:44:55.200]  The problem was, for audio,
[02:44:55.200 --> 02:44:57.920]  having a cable go from your wrist to your ears
[02:44:57.920 --> 02:44:59.840]  was often awful.
[02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:01.240]  Yeah, because that was before Bluetooth was really a thing.
[02:45:01.240 --> 02:45:03.120]  Oh, yeah, it was definitely before Bluetooth.
[02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:05.880]  And you'd have this, and it always sort of felt like
[02:45:05.880 --> 02:45:07.480]  you had an IV hooked up to you.
[02:45:07.480 --> 02:45:10.160]  You know, like it's just,
[02:45:10.160 --> 02:45:12.080]  like in a way that it just never feels good
[02:45:12.080 --> 02:45:15.060]  to be tethered to an IV when you're in the hospital
[02:45:15.060 --> 02:45:18.480]  or drawing blood or whatever is going on.
[02:45:18.480 --> 02:45:20.720]  It just never felt good to have a cable
[02:45:20.720 --> 02:45:23.400]  connected to my wrist and my head.
[02:45:23.400 --> 02:45:26.040]  You know, but I feel like we're finally at the point
[02:45:26.040 --> 02:45:27.640]  where we will finally be this fall
[02:45:27.640 --> 02:45:29.720]  when watchOS comes out with this support,
[02:45:29.720 --> 02:45:32.780]  where a combination of AirPods and Apple Watch
[02:45:32.780 --> 02:45:36.040]  with audio support, good audio support,
[02:45:36.040 --> 02:45:38.280]  will actually give us a thing that we've,
[02:45:38.280 --> 02:45:41.220]  I've been looking for for, you know, 15 years.
[02:45:41.220 --> 02:45:43.440]  Yeah, they finally gave it to us.
[02:45:43.440 --> 02:45:46.000]  And again, I have been using it.
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:47.640]  I've been testing with it, doing lots of dog walks
[02:45:47.640 --> 02:45:50.340]  with just my watch and everything, and it's great.
[02:45:50.340 --> 02:45:52.360]  And I think, you know, I ultimately,
[02:45:52.360 --> 02:45:54.500]  I don't think people are gonna use it that much
[02:45:54.500 --> 02:45:55.800]  compared to using their phone,
[02:45:55.800 --> 02:45:58.760]  because your phone is still better if you have it with you.
[02:45:58.760 --> 02:46:00.260]  But if you don't have it with you,
[02:46:00.260 --> 02:46:01.540]  or if you don't wanna have it with you,
[02:46:01.540 --> 02:46:02.680]  this now gives you the option.
[02:46:02.680 --> 02:46:05.160]  Yeah, it really exemplifies, to me,
[02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:06.840]  an unusual pattern for Apple.
[02:46:06.840 --> 02:46:09.400]  Like, in the old days, Microsoft was famous
[02:46:09.400 --> 02:46:14.400]  for this pattern of doing an absolutely dreadful 1.0
[02:46:14.400 --> 02:46:18.860]  that even at a point where they were a successful company,
[02:46:18.860 --> 02:46:21.740]  or maybe the most successful company in all of technology,
[02:46:21.740 --> 02:46:24.340]  whatever they came out with as a 1.0 would be terrible,
[02:46:24.340 --> 02:46:26.860]  and even the might of, marketing might of Microsoft
[02:46:26.860 --> 02:46:31.000]  couldn't make it, it was both bad, technically,
[02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:34.020]  and a failure in the market.
[02:46:34.020 --> 02:46:36.100]  But then, rather than abandon it,
[02:46:36.100 --> 02:46:38.820]  keep their nose to the grindstone and do a 2.0
[02:46:38.820 --> 02:46:43.500]  that still wasn't any good, but was clearly better,
[02:46:43.500 --> 02:46:45.420]  and still not give up on it,
[02:46:45.420 --> 02:46:47.260]  and spend another 18 months at it,
[02:46:47.260 --> 02:46:48.700]  and come out with a 3.0,
[02:46:48.700 --> 02:46:50.700]  and it is best exemplified by Windows, right?
[02:46:50.700 --> 02:46:53.900]  Nobody even, most, there are very few people of any age
[02:46:53.900 --> 02:46:55.380]  who remember any version of Windows
[02:46:55.380 --> 02:46:58.780]  prior to Windows 3.1, really, but that 3.0 look.
[02:46:58.780 --> 02:47:00.800]  When you show people screenshots of Windows 2,
[02:47:00.800 --> 02:47:03.660]  and especially Windows 1, I never saw Windows 2 or 1, never.
[02:47:03.660 --> 02:47:04.500]  You just die.
[02:47:04.500 --> 02:47:05.940]  My first computer had 3.1 on it.
[02:47:05.940 --> 02:47:08.860]  I was a nerd, and I had friends who had PCs,
[02:47:08.860 --> 02:47:11.660]  and I, you know, they never,
[02:47:11.660 --> 02:47:13.500]  I don't even know that we knew Windows existed.
[02:47:13.500 --> 02:47:15.860]  They just never left, didn't ever use anything but DOS,
[02:47:15.860 --> 02:47:17.540]  but, you know, Windows is,
[02:47:17.540 --> 02:47:19.500]  but there are all sorts of Microsoft products like that,
[02:47:19.500 --> 02:47:21.780]  and I don't know that the watch was quite that bad,
[02:47:21.780 --> 02:47:24.580]  but it's a similar, Apple's better known
[02:47:24.580 --> 02:47:26.580]  for coming out with, like, a sensation, you know?
[02:47:26.580 --> 02:47:28.580]  Like, the way that, oh, there were so many problems
[02:47:28.580 --> 02:47:30.300]  with the original iPhone, and it,
[02:47:30.300 --> 02:47:32.660]  edge networking, and it didn't even shoot video,
[02:47:32.660 --> 02:47:34.140]  and the still photos were terrible,
[02:47:34.140 --> 02:47:36.620]  and it was really kind of over, you know,
[02:47:36.620 --> 02:47:38.140]  underpowered, CPU-wise.
[02:47:38.140 --> 02:47:39.100]  Didn't have GPS, either.
[02:47:39.100 --> 02:47:39.940]  Didn't have GPS.
[02:47:39.940 --> 02:47:41.940]  It was missing all sorts of ridiculous things.
[02:47:41.940 --> 02:47:43.940]  Didn't even have an app store, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[02:47:43.940 --> 02:47:45.900]  but it was still, it was just a sensation.
[02:47:45.900 --> 02:47:47.620]  It was absol, and, you know,
[02:47:47.620 --> 02:47:49.980]  and in hindsight, sensation, it's like,
[02:47:49.980 --> 02:47:51.860]  it only sold, like, 11 million in the first year,
[02:47:51.860 --> 02:47:52.700]  or something like that,
[02:47:52.700 --> 02:47:56.220]  but it was way more millions than they promised to sell,
[02:47:56.220 --> 02:47:57.460]  but it was just a great product.
[02:47:57.460 --> 02:47:58.700]  Apple's known for stuff like that.
[02:47:58.700 --> 02:48:00.820]  The watch is almost evolving more
[02:48:00.820 --> 02:48:02.340]  in, like, a Microsoft-like fashion,
[02:48:02.340 --> 02:48:05.500]  where the one, the first one was really, like,
[02:48:05.500 --> 02:48:06.340]  Really rough.
[02:48:06.340 --> 02:48:08.540]  Really rough, and you really didn't see a lot of them
[02:48:08.540 --> 02:48:12.100]  out in the field, even among our friends, you know,
[02:48:12.100 --> 02:48:16.220]  or our crowd, even, and here we are, you know,
[02:48:16.220 --> 02:48:18.300]  what, four years later?
[02:48:18.300 --> 02:48:19.140]  Three, four, yeah.
[02:48:19.140 --> 02:48:22.020]  Yeah, and it is a really compelling,
[02:48:22.020 --> 02:48:23.460]  and I see them all over the place, you know,
[02:48:23.460 --> 02:48:25.820]  here in the beach town.
[02:48:25.820 --> 02:48:27.100]  Everybody, they're all over the place.
[02:48:27.100 --> 02:48:28.820]  Yeah, I see them everywhere now.
[02:48:28.820 --> 02:48:31.100]  Right, and it just really seems,
[02:48:31.100 --> 02:48:34.540]  even all rumors of, you know, a design refresh
[02:48:34.540 --> 02:48:36.780]  possibly coming later this year
[02:48:36.780 --> 02:48:39.620]  that'll make it thinner or whatever,
[02:48:39.620 --> 02:48:41.340]  but finally sort of like a new look
[02:48:41.340 --> 02:48:44.580]  after three generations of sort of
[02:48:44.580 --> 02:48:46.420]  the identical industrial design
[02:48:46.420 --> 02:48:49.620]  actually even getting thicker, actually, year over year,
[02:48:51.340 --> 02:48:53.180]  but just the software side of it
[02:48:53.180 --> 02:48:55.940]  is really seems like there's a couple of finales in there
[02:48:55.940 --> 02:48:58.340]  that it's really becoming a compelling product,
[02:48:59.460 --> 02:49:01.980]  and finally, really, for the first time,
[02:49:01.980 --> 02:49:04.420]  really becoming interesting for third-party apps.
[02:49:04.420 --> 02:49:06.900]  Yeah, that's, you know, the hardware
[02:49:06.900 --> 02:49:09.940]  has been fairly decent on the watch since long,
[02:49:09.940 --> 02:49:11.620]  with the exception of the first one just being super slow,
[02:49:11.620 --> 02:49:15.460]  but the software, it was really, like,
[02:49:15.460 --> 02:49:19.260]  prohibitively limited for third-party apps, especially,
[02:49:19.260 --> 02:49:23.220]  until, really until watchOS 3 and 4 at least,
[02:49:23.220 --> 02:49:27.780]  and watchOS 5 makes a number of seemingly small changes,
[02:49:27.780 --> 02:49:31.020]  but changes that make or break certain uses, like audio.
[02:49:32.180 --> 02:49:34.180]  So anyway, that's good to hear.
[02:49:34.180 --> 02:49:35.340]  It was actually a loaded question,
[02:49:35.340 --> 02:49:37.580]  because I've played with the beta,
[02:49:37.580 --> 02:49:38.780]  running on Marco's watch,
[02:49:38.780 --> 02:49:42.100]  so they're a little behind-the-scenes insight for you.
[02:49:42.100 --> 02:49:44.100]  I actually totally cheated and knew the answer
[02:49:44.100 --> 02:49:46.060]  to that question before I asked.
[02:49:46.060 --> 02:49:47.460]  Yeah, I also knew that away suitcases
[02:49:47.460 --> 02:49:49.780]  have washable laundry bags, but here we are.
[02:49:51.260 --> 02:49:53.380]  Like I said, there are numerous advantages
[02:49:53.380 --> 02:49:55.100]  to recording a podcast in the same room
[02:49:55.100 --> 02:49:57.260]  as opposed to two or three hundred miles apart.
[02:49:57.260 --> 02:49:58.980]  Marco, thank you so much.
[02:49:58.980 --> 02:50:02.060]  I can thank you for tons of things this week,
[02:50:02.060 --> 02:50:05.220]  but taking the time out to do this is truly,
[02:50:05.220 --> 02:50:06.140]  truly tremendous.
[02:50:06.140 --> 02:50:07.380]  Thanks for having me, my pleasure.
[02:50:07.380 --> 02:50:08.340]  It's always a joy.
[02:50:08.340 --> 02:50:10.180]  All right, my thanks to our sponsors.
[02:50:11.780 --> 02:50:14.980]  We had Squarespace, where you can go to build a website.
[02:50:14.980 --> 02:50:18.580]  We had Away, where you can buy excellent luggage.
[02:50:19.660 --> 02:50:22.180]  We had Tres Pontas, who made the coffee
[02:50:22.180 --> 02:50:23.540]  that I finished over an hour ago
[02:50:23.540 --> 02:50:26.900]  and wished I had remembered to bring the pot in here.
[02:50:26.900 --> 02:50:28.220]  I have three more pounds in the kitchen,
[02:50:28.220 --> 02:50:29.820]  so I think we're all right for at least a day.
[02:50:29.820 --> 02:50:31.380]  So that I could go have more,
[02:50:31.380 --> 02:50:34.540]  and last but not least,
[02:50:34.540 --> 02:50:39.100]  Mack Weldon, makers of excellent daily essentials,
[02:50:39.100 --> 02:50:41.780]  things like underwear, T-shirts, socks,
[02:50:41.780 --> 02:50:45.700]  very stylish, long-lasting, and so easy to buy.
[02:50:45.700 --> 02:50:46.980]  My thanks to all of them,
[02:50:46.980 --> 02:50:51.620]  and of course, to Marco Arment for his time.
[02:50:51.620 --> 02:50:53.140]  Thanks.
[02:50:53.140 --> 02:50:54.540]  All right, there we go.
[02:50:54.540 --> 02:50:55.580]  That was good.
[02:50:55.580 --> 02:50:56.420]  Yeah.
[02:50:56.420 --> 02:50:57.380]  Short for us.
[02:50:57.380 --> 02:50:58.500]  Yeah, really?
[02:50:58.500 --> 02:51:01.500]  That's kind of funny, that really was.
