[00:00.000 --> 00:06.340]  you had a baby. Yes. Little Mazie's almost seven months old. So and it just I mean, it's
[00:06.340 --> 00:11.900]  been a complete whirlwind is as I'm sure you know from years ago, but yeah, my my brain
[00:11.900 --> 00:16.580]  is all sort of all over the place. It it looks like the last time you were on the show was
[00:16.580 --> 00:25.460]  April 2017. Is that crazy? Wow. So yeah, two years ago. Yeah, that's a, again, if I condensed
[00:25.460 --> 00:31.240]  the past seven months into like 10 seconds, that seems about right. I am following along
[00:31.240 --> 00:38.520]  with young Maisley on on the Instagram, and she looks delightful. Thank you. Yeah, I think
[00:38.520 --> 00:43.820]  Megan. So Megan and I obviously both run that account, but she does more of the more of
[00:43.820 --> 00:48.560]  the posting, I would say it's always funny. She's she notes sometimes how, how avid of
[00:48.560 --> 00:54.120]  a follower you are, which we appreciate. It's, you know, sometimes I feel like a hypocrite
[00:54.120 --> 01:00.380]  for for being such a vocal Facebook critic and still enjoying Instagram and other times
[01:00.380 --> 01:05.920]  when it's it can be so personal like that. I'm like, you know, I'm willing to I'm willing
[01:05.920 --> 01:10.780]  to eat this hypocrisy for the time being because you know, I feel like I'm getting something
[01:10.780 --> 01:15.220]  out of this. Yeah, I'm right there with you. And I mean, I know you were you were very
[01:15.220 --> 01:19.720]  early I would say on that ahead of that trend right with Facebook. And did you ever even
[01:19.720 --> 01:24.760]  sign up? I know you have Instagram but not Facebook itself never signed up for Facebook.
[01:24.760 --> 01:30.520]  And that looks pretty prescient these days. But yeah, even those of us who are sort of
[01:30.520 --> 01:34.460]  now more vocal critics in the in the later years after everything that's went down the
[01:34.460 --> 01:40.680]  past two years with Facebook, still can't quite wean myself off of it. Mainly for family
[01:40.680 --> 01:44.720]  reasons, like my mom uses it a ton. And so it's a way she follows Maisie and everything
[01:44.720 --> 01:50.300]  but but also, yeah, Instagram still remains just an awesome network. And so it's a it's
[01:50.300 --> 01:53.600]  hard not to have that hypocrisy, I guess.
[01:53.600 --> 01:59.640]  You know, and I yeah, so I hear it loudly admitting that I use Instagram. I'm not sure
[01:59.640 --> 02:06.080]  that Instagram at this point, especially once Kevin Systrom and whoever the other co founder
[02:06.080 --> 02:14.300]  was decided to leave my career. You know, our Instagram's privacy policies and data
[02:14.300 --> 02:18.720]  retention any better than Facebook is really is it really worth thinking of Instagram as
[02:18.720 --> 02:23.600]  an independent entity of Facebook? I think probably not. So I mean, I again, I'm not
[02:23.600 --> 02:29.100]  trying to do like a holier than now or better than now thing. But I think that not having
[02:29.100 --> 02:33.600]  ever signed up for Facebook is a lot easier than quitting. Just because of the things
[02:33.600 --> 02:37.280]  you say like so like my mom, I don't even know if my mom's on Facebook. I don't think
[02:37.280 --> 02:41.240]  she is right. I know I have family, you know, I've got my sister I'm surely is. I think
[02:41.240 --> 02:45.760]  it would be it. Yeah, there is no awkward moment where I've stopped liking her pictures
[02:45.760 --> 02:50.440]  of her kids on Facebook, because I never was in the first place. Right? Yeah, it's that
[02:50.440 --> 02:54.040]  and it's also, you know, all the services throughout the years, there's still a number
[02:54.040 --> 02:58.400]  of ones that I like often through Facebook, where I'll come across, you know, something
[02:58.400 --> 03:02.320]  that I'm trying to log into and I'm like, and I don't have like the password saved in
[03:02.320 --> 03:05.920]  one password or whatever. I'm like, what is what is my password? Then I realized, oh,
[03:05.920 --> 03:10.120]  I often through Facebook. And it's like, I probably have a dozen services like that.
[03:10.120 --> 03:15.640]  I did a bunch like that with Twitter. Just for the I thinking like, well, I know I've
[03:15.640 --> 03:20.160]  got my, my Twitter account secure, quote, unquote, but I really don't know that I think
[03:20.160 --> 03:24.500]  about it because they use the phone number is the second second factor, right? That's
[03:24.500 --> 03:28.840]  really not that great. So in hindsight, but this is like three, four years ago, I felt
[03:28.840 --> 03:35.160]  like my, my Twitter was very safe. And so I'd sign up for accounts in new services using
[03:35.160 --> 03:41.080]  my Twitter ID and have since come to regret that every time. And I'm slowly but when I
[03:41.080 --> 03:45.240]  realized that I like unwind it and see if there's, is there a way that I can magically
[03:45.240 --> 03:49.840]  switch to a regular login for X, Y, or Z service?
[03:49.840 --> 03:53.800]  Yeah. And I'm the same way. And obviously to a greater extent with Facebook, given all
[03:53.800 --> 03:58.840]  we're talking about, but it's just like, you know, when you're signing up for all these
[03:58.840 --> 04:03.440]  new services as you know, as I had to back in the day as a journalist and now as an investor,
[04:03.440 --> 04:08.000]  obviously still signing up for almost as many, if not more. And it's like, am I going to
[04:08.000 --> 04:11.460]  enter my email and come up with a password every single time for something that I may
[04:11.460 --> 04:16.240]  be going to use once? And so it's so enticing to just click the button of sign in with Facebook
[04:16.240 --> 04:22.240]  or Google or Twitter even now. Yeah. Yeah. It's funny that Apple never got into that.
[04:22.240 --> 04:28.020]  There has never been a sign into third party services with your iCloud. Yeah, they would
[04:28.020 --> 04:32.440]  have been a, I mean, especially now these days, you know, they could, they could certainly
[04:32.440 --> 04:37.920]  upsell that as a strong security and privacy component doing something like that with your
[04:37.920 --> 04:41.720]  yeah, iCloud account. I would, I think they should do that. I don't know why they, why
[04:41.720 --> 04:46.000]  they don't. I mean, it's not technically easy, I'm sure, but it seems like a huge thing that
[04:46.000 --> 04:54.000]  they could offer. Yeah. I just, just a thought as we go through all the privacy, the privacy
[04:54.000 --> 05:00.360]  Wars, that's what we'll look back on this era as, so anyway, the whole parent game is
[05:00.360 --> 05:06.120]  treating it well. Yeah. It's every day is, is something new and crazy, but it's, I feel
[05:06.120 --> 05:10.000]  like I have my feet at least a little bit under me until something changes tomorrow.
[05:10.000 --> 05:14.160]  But yeah, it's good at seven months. Let me think about this as she's, she's probably,
[05:14.160 --> 05:19.600]  she's rolling over for sure. Right? Yeah. She rolls around, not crawling yet. She's
[05:19.600 --> 05:23.800]  mainly sleeping through the night, which is awesome. Some nights obviously are different.
[05:23.800 --> 05:29.360]  She's also teething, so that can affect that a little bit. And but yeah, it's, it's, it's,
[05:29.360 --> 05:33.720]  it's pretty awesome. It's a long time for me. My son is 15. It feels like a very long
[05:33.720 --> 05:38.960]  time. And so he's our only kid. But, uh, but the teething thing was interesting because
[05:38.960 --> 05:44.440]  you think about, yeah, but I'm sure that hurts. But then it's like when their gums hurt, it,
[05:44.440 --> 05:48.760]  it is like must be excruciating. It makes sense that it would be like there's a tooth
[05:48.760 --> 05:52.880]  cutting through their gum. But then the other thing is that you kind of feel like, like
[05:52.880 --> 05:58.080]  a genius doctor on TV. You're like, I've got it. It's teething. And it's like, right, right.
[05:58.080 --> 06:02.760]  We had like ice cold pacifier, you know, that's in the freezer. Get that and, and let her
[06:02.760 --> 06:06.600]  suck on this, you know, ice cold thing or, or put a little bit of that, uh, or a gel
[06:06.600 --> 06:11.680]  or whatever it was on there. That's right. It works. And you're like, Holy crap, I solved
[06:11.680 --> 06:15.900]  the problem. Yeah. When, when she was first going through it, of course we were like,
[06:15.900 --> 06:19.600]  what is going on? Why is she crying? Like, uh, she's been fed, she's been changed. I'm
[06:19.600 --> 06:22.920]  going through the checklist and then it's like you just put your finger in her mouth.
[06:22.920 --> 06:28.440]  It's like, Oh yeah, that's why. Yeah. Uh, my other thing too is, is around that age.
[06:28.440 --> 06:34.020]  It's one of my favorite, like to me, like Holy crap. Parenting moments was the beginning
[06:34.020 --> 06:40.200]  to roll over because there's like newborn and newborn. It's like, I don't know that
[06:40.200 --> 06:44.520]  those weeks are a blur and it's like, Oh my God, we've got a baby, we've got a baby. And
[06:44.520 --> 06:49.280]  it's like you just, uh, you know, and then all of a sudden you're like a month in and
[06:49.280 --> 06:55.040]  the kid feels sturdier. You feel more confident, you know, and you get used to being able to
[06:55.040 --> 07:02.440]  put the baby down, walk away and do something and then come back and the baby is right where
[07:02.440 --> 07:06.800]  you left them. It's like you can put a cup of coffee down and then you could go do something
[07:06.800 --> 07:10.880]  and when you come back, the cup of coffee is still there. Once the kid starts rolling
[07:10.880 --> 07:14.960]  over, it is like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, what do we do? What do we do? We can never put this
[07:14.960 --> 07:21.640]  kid down. Yes. So we have this, this product called Nanette, which is like a newfangled
[07:21.640 --> 07:25.840]  baby monitor. So it's a, it's a camera that overlooks the entire crib so you can get a
[07:25.840 --> 07:30.640]  bird's eye view of the whole crib and it runs all night and it's, and it actually, you know,
[07:30.640 --> 07:36.040]  it has iPhone and iPad apps. So we basically have a, an iPad that sits at the, the, uh,
[07:36.040 --> 07:40.180]  the bedside so we can sort of monitor and just when, you know, I'll jolt up at 4am and
[07:40.180 --> 07:43.580]  wonder like, how's Maisie doing? And then I'll just look on the monitor and I can see
[07:43.580 --> 07:47.880]  and, but what's really funny about that is now with her rolling and, and just moving
[07:47.880 --> 07:54.120]  around, I mean she does at least, I would say three full turns a night. Just like it's
[07:54.120 --> 07:58.800]  not even clear how she does it with, you know, given her length and sort of the size of the
[07:58.800 --> 08:03.700]  sides of the crib. But it's like she's, she's like a clock moving around the thing. Curly
[08:03.700 --> 08:09.860]  from the three Stooges down there on the ground. Exactly. Yeah, that's exactly right. Um, yeah.
[08:09.860 --> 08:14.880]  So it's, it's funny to watch the next one coming up and then, and then it, to me it's
[08:14.880 --> 08:19.920]  just the biggest landmark is the first day you come in and she's standing up in the crib.
[08:19.920 --> 08:24.360]  Yeah. Uh, yeah. Cause the thing about it is it's like you think, well, you're going to
[08:24.360 --> 08:27.700]  be blown. You, you, you and your partner are going to be blown away. The parents are going
[08:27.700 --> 08:32.140]  to be like, whoa, you know, the baby's standing up. But the thing with, at least with Jonas
[08:32.140 --> 08:37.280]  was he was like, yeah, look at me. Look at me. I got something now. I've got something.
[08:37.280 --> 08:45.180]  Yeah. He's just given us this look like I've got a super game has changed. Yeah. Oh, I'm
[08:45.180 --> 08:49.460]  very happy for you. Thank you. Thank you very much. I don't know what you want to get started
[08:49.460 --> 08:53.220]  with, but I was going to start with Apple and the original content stuff and I thought
[08:53.220 --> 08:57.540]  you, you've had a lot to say about it. Uh, since their event, you know, I missed that
[08:57.540 --> 09:02.300]  event. Yeah. I was going to ask you, I didn't, I, it seemed like you didn't, that was one.
[09:02.300 --> 09:07.900]  Is that one of the only ones you've ever missed? I've missed since I started getting press
[09:07.900 --> 09:18.300]  invitations around 26, 2006 or so, uh, maybe 2005 like with Mac worlds. Uh, I've missed
[09:18.300 --> 09:24.700]  too. I had, uh, I had eye surgery a couple of years ago, like 2014 and couldn't, was
[09:24.700 --> 09:30.420]  not allowed to fly. Uh, and then this last one I missed cause we had a longstanding vacation
[09:30.420 --> 09:35.060]  for my son's spring break that I didn't want to miss. Got it. Uh, so that's interesting.
[09:35.060 --> 09:39.460]  So like me and I, you know, I haven't been, I haven't been to one in a while. I used to
[09:39.460 --> 09:44.380]  go, so, you know, there's this whole interesting dynamic with, uh, obviously the place I've
[09:44.380 --> 09:48.340]  worked for the past six years now has been GV, which is Google ventures. So Google's
[09:48.340 --> 09:53.620]  our only LP and I think the Google Apple relationship these days is a lot better than it was. But
[09:53.620 --> 09:58.380]  um, uh, there was a time there where I was still working, uh, in the earlier days at
[09:58.380 --> 10:03.540]  GV and I was still going to the Apple events, but those sort of invites, uh, dwindled over
[10:03.540 --> 10:09.180]  the years. Um, and also of course I have a day to day job. And so the, the Monday morning,
[10:09.180 --> 10:14.860]  uh, uh, event is not very conducive to the Monday morning VC partner meeting. Um, but
[10:14.860 --> 10:19.900]  uh, so I haven't been to one in, I don't know, like three or four years in person. I watched
[10:19.900 --> 10:22.820]  them all when they're live stream and I think they're all live stream these days. Right.
[10:22.820 --> 10:26.940]  So, um, I don't watch them some often in real time, but I'll watch the, uh, you know, the
[10:26.940 --> 10:31.620]  after that after play it afterwards. And um, so I've seen them all, but yeah, it's been
[10:31.620 --> 10:35.820]  a long time since I've been in the room. So, uh, interesting that we'll have the same perspective
[10:35.820 --> 10:41.660]  being from afar. Yeah. And I wonder how different that would be, uh, especially for this last,
[10:41.660 --> 10:46.260]  this last event, which I thought was so strange. Yes. Very deliberately. So like, I don't think
[10:46.260 --> 10:51.100]  they messed up and, and it was strange. I think they plotted out a very unusual event.
[10:51.100 --> 10:57.820]  Um, do you watch the game of thrones? Yeah. Oh yes. So I'm a game of thrones watcher and
[10:57.820 --> 11:03.180]  I'm just, uh, I don't want to spoil anything. So anybody out there who's either, he's either
[11:03.180 --> 11:08.020]  got it queued up or hasn't watched yet. It's, I've already said a couple of things online
[11:08.020 --> 11:13.260]  and people are like, you know, I tweeted out a gift and like people are so pissed. You
[11:13.260 --> 11:19.220]  gotta be careful. You know what I mean? Cause you know, but, but the one thing that hit
[11:19.220 --> 11:23.860]  me watching it this week and you know, there, it's for those of you who don't know, and
[11:23.860 --> 11:27.780]  I can't even believe how that is possible. Game of thrones is this incredibly popular
[11:27.780 --> 11:33.780]  show on HBO. It's in the date and final season. I think that there's only six episodes this
[11:33.780 --> 11:38.540]  season. Is that correct? Yeah. Yeah. Six. And that was the th this week's was the third.
[11:38.540 --> 11:43.340]  So right. So we're halfway through. So there's only three episodes left of this incredibly
[11:43.340 --> 11:51.460]  long running epic tale with literally a 50, 60 characters, maybe more. Uh, like somebody
[11:51.460 --> 11:57.580]  who runs like the game of thrones Wiki is like bursting or laughing right now. Right.
[11:57.580 --> 12:03.420]  Main characters. You mean? But the thing that really hit me was the, I think HBO gets it
[12:03.420 --> 12:09.460]  right. HBO still releases the show that good old fashioned way where Sunday at nine o'clock
[12:09.460 --> 12:15.500]  PM, your local time, it hits HBO and if you're streaming it, I don't know if they, how they
[12:15.500 --> 12:19.060]  do that. Like do they just go by your time zone? Like if you're in California and you've
[12:19.060 --> 12:24.860]  got like, you know, so it goes up at east coast, 9pm east coast time. So 6pm on the
[12:24.860 --> 12:27.860]  way you can watch it at six o'clock. All right. I think I remember that from the sopranos.
[12:27.860 --> 12:32.340]  I was, I happened to be in California for some, probably an apple event when the sopranos
[12:32.340 --> 12:37.340]  finale went on and I, now that you mentioned it, I think we did watch it like six. Could
[12:37.340 --> 12:41.100]  you imagine if they didn't do that with social media and everything? Like, yeah, they would
[12:41.100 --> 12:45.980]  be up in arms. I think they have to do that. Yeah. It's like a sporting event. Right. As
[12:45.980 --> 12:51.940]  opposed to Netflix, which has when they, you know, like a new season of stranger things
[12:51.940 --> 12:56.180]  comes out, it is just like, boom, here's 10 episodes of stranger things. If you'd like
[12:56.180 --> 13:01.380]  to watch them all in a row, go ahead. You know, make, make some coffee. I like the HBO
[13:01.380 --> 13:06.660]  way better. So it's interesting. I, I wrote a post about this probably a few years ago
[13:06.660 --> 13:10.180]  at this point already, because I was thinking about the exact same thing. And I was thinking
[13:10.180 --> 13:13.300]  about it actually in the context of stranger things, which is, you know, a Netflix show.
[13:13.300 --> 13:16.740]  Of course, it's, I think coming back for its third season this year. And I think it was
[13:16.740 --> 13:21.660]  after season one, it became, you know, like a phenomenon. And the weird thing about it
[13:21.660 --> 13:25.260]  was the weird thing about all Netflix shows that they dumped them all at once dating back
[13:25.260 --> 13:28.700]  to house of cards, right. When it was very, when it was a completely new approach to do
[13:28.700 --> 13:33.500]  this, but with these sort of these cultural phenomenon, things that take over like stranger
[13:33.500 --> 13:40.540]  things it's fascinating because when they're dumped all at once, the water cooler effect
[13:40.540 --> 13:45.820]  is very different because there is no episode by episode talking about it. I mean, there
[13:45.820 --> 13:50.720]  is, but it's not coordinated or synced because everyone's in a different place, right? Depending
[13:50.720 --> 13:57.600]  on how fast they're watching it. And so it almost, I agree with you for a good portion
[13:57.600 --> 14:01.700]  of shows, again, these ones that are sort of these cultural moments. I think that it
[14:01.700 --> 14:07.780]  sort of is almost behooves them to do the Netflix or sorry, the HBO model where you
[14:07.780 --> 14:13.100]  release them at a regular cadence just to build up anticipation. And again, to be able
[14:13.100 --> 14:18.540]  to talk about them with other people in real time and all be sort of coordinated around
[14:18.540 --> 14:22.960]  the same thing versus trying to talk about, you know, 60 hours of contents in one fell
[14:22.960 --> 14:28.260]  swoop is, is impossible. Right. And house of cards. Well, I would say stranger things
[14:28.260 --> 14:37.380]  too. They're, they're both classic, uh, serial melodrama, you know, where, you know, dating
[14:37.380 --> 14:42.380]  back to the 18 hundreds when, uh, Dickens would be writing his, you know, what we now
[14:42.380 --> 14:47.220]  think of as his novels, they were all published serially chapter by chapter in, I don't know
[14:47.220 --> 14:51.020]  if they were magazines or newspapers, but you know, but you'd, you'd read, you know,
[14:51.020 --> 14:55.580]  the next chapter of a tale of two cities and it would end with some kind of cliffhanger.
[14:55.580 --> 15:00.460]  And then all of a sudden you're there, you know, your fists and anger get me next week's
[15:00.460 --> 15:06.620]  issue. Uh, it, it's no different, you know, than, than, you know, certain famous episodes
[15:06.620 --> 15:10.820]  of house of cards where, where crazy things happen at the very end of the episode, stranger
[15:10.820 --> 15:14.500]  things, certainly, you know, there's, you can see it that you're, you're not meant to
[15:14.500 --> 15:20.440]  start the next episode. You're meant to, you're meant to absorb that ending. I totally agree
[15:20.440 --> 15:23.580]  with you. And right, especially for these cliffhanger endings, it's like, if you can
[15:23.580 --> 15:27.420]  go onto the next one, what is the point of the cliffhanger? Um, either cliffhanger or
[15:27.420 --> 15:33.220]  like big shocking reveal. Yes, totally, totally. And so I wouldn't be, I wouldn't be shocked.
[15:33.220 --> 15:36.120]  And I think there's already been rumors of this. Maybe they've even talked about like
[15:36.120 --> 15:41.000]  some of the upcoming shows may, you know, go back to that model. I mean, I know Netflix
[15:41.000 --> 15:44.280]  in the past has said that they don't want to do that, but sort of like they don't want
[15:44.280 --> 15:48.700]  to release movies in theaters and now they had to do that for Academy award reasons.
[15:48.700 --> 15:54.620]  Right. I feel like I would be surprised if they didn't eventually sort of cave to the
[15:54.620 --> 15:59.460]  creators in this regard and be like, if a creator just really wants to have that type
[15:59.460 --> 16:04.240]  of experience for their audience, like why not allow them to do that? I think that that's
[16:04.240 --> 16:07.160]  a no brainer. And then, you know, once it's out there in the world, then you can stream
[16:07.160 --> 16:10.300]  it and like, so people watch it after the fact and stream them all at once. But if you're
[16:10.300 --> 16:15.060]  watching in real time, just do it at a regular cadence release them. And it really seems
[16:15.060 --> 16:20.140]  to me, I mean, part of it is that I enjoy the anticipation. I like that, you know, it's
[16:20.140 --> 16:25.580]  the same way of like being a sports fan. Like it neat, like when your team gets in the playoffs
[16:25.580 --> 16:30.340]  and you know when the next game is, you know, it's neat to have that looking, it's like
[16:30.340 --> 16:34.120]  something to look forward to all week long. I like the idea that come Sunday, I've got
[16:34.120 --> 16:40.780]  a next episode of game of Thrones and I totally agree. And it also, it, it, it allows those
[16:40.780 --> 16:44.860]  individual episodes to sort of stand on their own more. They're not cheap. And because,
[16:44.860 --> 16:48.780]  you know, you're just like an onslaught and you won't remember everything. There's also
[16:48.780 --> 16:52.720]  like the added benefit of just being able to talk about it for a week, right? Like those,
[16:52.720 --> 16:57.300]  some of the things that I love now are you know, the ringer does their after show for
[16:57.300 --> 17:00.400]  a game of Thrones. They've been doing it for a while. They used to do it on HBO itself
[17:00.400 --> 17:06.000]  and now they do it on Twitter. Actually. I think it's talked to Thrones and right after
[17:06.000 --> 17:10.500]  it ends, they get on, they just go on Periscope or whatever and just, it's a round table discussion
[17:10.500 --> 17:13.520]  and it's like, those things are great and you can not do that when you just dump all
[17:13.520 --> 17:19.760]  the content at once. Right. It is, you know, we're losing collectively our shared experiences,
[17:19.760 --> 17:23.040]  you know, like, you know, I mean, but I'm not, this is not a genius observation. Everybody
[17:23.040 --> 17:26.980]  talks about this, but the fact that, you know, TV used to be entirely, there was no streaming
[17:26.980 --> 17:32.260]  in the old days and there was no TiVo, there were no DVRs. Everybody, everybody watched
[17:32.260 --> 17:39.160]  happy days at eight o'clock, you know, whether you liked it or not. But combine that, you
[17:39.160 --> 17:45.280]  know, like, like the internet is why we've lost a lot of that simultaneous viewing. But
[17:45.280 --> 17:53.360]  when we do, we get to share it together, you know, with Twitter or whatever. Yes. Yeah.
[17:53.360 --> 17:57.740]  And so I feel like, cause a lot of people are talking, you know, given the end of game
[17:57.740 --> 18:02.760]  of Thrones now about this being the last one of these, right. That last sort of show, there
[18:02.760 --> 18:07.120]  will still be sports of course, but the last show that sort of this come together moments
[18:07.120 --> 18:11.440]  for multiple people because so many people are watching it. You know, tens of millions
[18:11.440 --> 18:15.180]  of people every single week are watching it at the same time basically. And that will
[18:15.180 --> 18:19.280]  that ever happen again? And I do think like, I think that's a huge opportunity for something
[18:19.280 --> 18:24.600]  like Twitter, potentially Facebook and some of the other social services because there
[18:24.600 --> 18:30.400]  is this like, you know, it's the best example of sort of the second screen thing where,
[18:30.400 --> 18:33.540]  and sports is another example of it, where these things that are happening in real time
[18:33.540 --> 18:38.160]  and people want to talk about them, it feels like they can be the glue that, that sort
[18:38.160 --> 18:42.100]  of makes that happen. But you can't do that if everyone's not watching it at the same
[18:42.100 --> 18:49.760]  time. Yeah. So here's just a funny example. So the Sixers, I'm kind of falling in love
[18:49.760 --> 18:54.000]  with the Sixers. I've been out of the NBA for a number of years other than as a casual
[18:54.000 --> 18:57.920]  fan, but I'm, I'm, I want to have, you know, this is, that's my home team. I like the Sixers.
[18:57.920 --> 19:02.360]  I like these guys. I like the weird, it's a weird team just in terms of how they're
[19:02.360 --> 19:08.640]  put together. And they're playing last night, up in Toronto, down one game to know, and
[19:08.640 --> 19:13.640]  they're, the Sixers are blowing a lead, not blowing it, but the Toronto hit a couple of
[19:13.640 --> 19:17.920]  three pointers and the Sixers missed a couple of shots and all of a sudden, you know, a
[19:17.920 --> 19:22.880]  comfortable nine point lead was down to three fouled. There's 3.8 seconds left. Sixers only
[19:22.880 --> 19:31.360]  have a three point lead and our power went out. I was just like, what the hell just happened?
[19:31.360 --> 19:34.480]  And we've lived at this place now for two years. Power has never gone out. There was
[19:34.480 --> 19:39.320]  no, there were no storms in the area. It wasn't, it wasn't actually a very nice night. I was
[19:39.320 --> 19:43.960]  like, I guess the power's out. And then I went outside. We have like a townhouse, so
[19:43.960 --> 19:48.280]  we have a whole bunch of neighbors and I go out and every single guy, every single man
[19:48.280 --> 19:52.400]  who lives on our block was out there and everybody's like, what happened to the Sixers? What happened
[19:52.400 --> 19:55.560]  to the Sixers? And then somebody had it on their phone and they're like, Sixers won.
[19:55.560 --> 19:58.440]  They won by four or something like that. And we're like, all right, what the hell's, what
[19:58.440 --> 20:02.360]  the heck's going on with the power? Like the first thing we all asked was what happened
[20:02.360 --> 20:06.120]  with the Sixers. And I thought, you know, this is kind of funny. Like I would be doing this
[20:06.120 --> 20:09.360]  on Twitter, but I wouldn't be doing it with my neighbors, but it's just kind of a nice
[20:09.360 --> 20:14.520]  moment. Have a little neighborly friendship there. And everybody was, I like that a good,
[20:14.520 --> 20:19.380]  a good, bad thing. It's sort of, this also reminds me of something else I've, I've sort
[20:19.380 --> 20:24.160]  of been thinking about and wrote about recently where, so in a world where we're moving away
[20:24.160 --> 20:29.320]  from this. Imagine if there's a way, and so a lot of people, I haven't seen it yet, but
[20:29.320 --> 20:32.400]  a lot of people obviously are talking about the new Avengers movie, right? Obviously it's
[20:32.400 --> 20:37.880]  hard to see movies with babies, but I'm still getting used to that. But so I think we're
[20:37.880 --> 20:41.340]  going to try to go this weekend. But anyway, so I can't spoil anything for anyone, but
[20:41.340 --> 20:45.180]  everyone's talking about the resurrection of the movie theater, right? After years and
[20:45.180 --> 20:50.360]  years of declines. And now it made over 300, 350 million, I think at the US box office,
[20:50.360 --> 20:53.400]  right? Over the weekend and well over a billion dollars worldwide. So it's like the resurrection
[20:53.400 --> 20:58.720]  of the movie theater. And I think this ties into what we're talking about because I had
[20:58.720 --> 21:03.320]  been thinking about what if they did Game of Thrones the last season, they just released
[21:03.320 --> 21:07.960]  it at least to start at least for, you know, maybe on a Thursday night before the Sunday
[21:07.960 --> 21:12.480]  premiere on HBO, if they just released it in theaters nationwide, like how much money
[21:12.480 --> 21:16.760]  could HBO have made, you know, from their perspective, but also what a cool like cultural,
[21:16.760 --> 21:21.160]  you know, experience again, right? You get to go to a movie theater and watch this very
[21:21.160 --> 21:26.200]  cinematic show on a giant screen with hundreds of other people around you and people are
[21:26.200 --> 21:30.300]  cheering and popcorn and all that all the great things about sort of the old school
[21:30.300 --> 21:37.040]  moviegoing experience, you know, can be brought back to life by things that are this this
[21:37.040 --> 21:44.800]  big and this culturally relevant it feels like it would be something one of my favorite
[21:44.800 --> 21:51.520]  stories about that the group cinematic experience is you're a movie fan, I bet you've seen
[21:51.520 --> 21:58.720]  that if you're raging bull. Yeah. So raging bulls Martin Scorsese 1980 boxing movie about
[21:58.720 --> 22:05.280]  what was his name Ray Ray Ray Lamota tragic movie overall tragic tale of a man who's sort
[22:05.280 --> 22:11.240]  of a broken man. A bad man really. But it's a very sad movie. Mostly. First time I ever
[22:11.240 --> 22:17.800]  watched it. I was by myself. In college. I had a job interview in like Virginia. And
[22:17.800 --> 22:22.680]  so the company flew me down and put me up in a hotel and I had an interview the next
[22:22.680 --> 22:28.720]  day. And I had nothing to do. I was like 19 had nothing to do and put on HBO and I looked
[22:28.720 --> 22:32.840]  at it and it said like, raging bull was coming up. I was like, I've never seen that. I'll
[22:32.840 --> 22:40.600]  watch that. And I watched it all by myself lonesome. Very depressing. I was into it.
[22:40.600 --> 22:46.360]  I would say I enjoyed the movie, but I didn't enjoy the experience. I really felt pretty
[22:46.360 --> 22:52.880]  low afterwards. Yeah. Yeah. And then I've watched it a couple of times. After that,
[22:52.880 --> 22:56.800]  in the intervening years in college, you know, it's just as a huge Scorsese fan. But then
[22:56.800 --> 23:00.560]  at one point in the mid 90s, I think it might have still been in college, but maybe later
[23:00.560 --> 23:07.260]  in the 90s. Roger Ebert came to Philadelphia, and was hosting he did he was hosting a screening
[23:07.260 --> 23:12.680]  of raging bull might have been like the 25th anniversary or 15th anniversary or something.
[23:12.680 --> 23:16.600]  And he didn't do the thing that he sometimes did where he would allow people to say stop
[23:16.600 --> 23:19.960]  and then stop the movie and then have a good discussion about what's going on that we just
[23:19.960 --> 23:24.640]  watched it straight through. And then we had a discussion led by Roger Ebert after the
[23:24.640 --> 23:29.640]  movie. And it was packed. It's a really nice theater over at Penn, sort of like a lecture
[23:29.640 --> 23:34.320]  hall style thing was a great picture. Great sound. Here's the thing that blew me away.
[23:34.320 --> 23:42.200]  Raging bull is hilarious. It is there are scenes that are so funny. I mean, just like
[23:42.200 --> 23:46.320]  but never like three, four times. I watched it before that never laughed once because
[23:46.320 --> 23:50.760]  I wasn't in a theater full of people. Right. It was like one of the scenes where she Joe
[23:50.760 --> 23:55.040]  Pat, she's having family, some kind of family meal and his kids screwing around with a spaghetti
[23:55.040 --> 23:58.640]  or something. It's hilarious. But you would never know it if you're not in a room full
[23:58.640 --> 24:04.880]  of people. It's the shared experience is different than the solo experience. Yeah. And I and
[24:04.880 --> 24:09.280]  I totally agree. And you know, these Yeah, you get sort of different social cues just
[24:09.280 --> 24:14.440]  in a vibe, right of being in a being in that type of experience. And I do feel like all
[24:14.440 --> 24:19.440]  the the Hollywood has a bunch of issues and we can talk about them in relation to Apple.
[24:19.440 --> 24:26.800]  But I think that there's a way to sort of to utilize what is great about the theaters
[24:26.800 --> 24:31.480]  in our new fangled era. And I think we're getting close to it, but we're not quite there
[24:31.480 --> 24:36.240]  yet. And maybe the Avengers like the fact that that it's so big, maybe it tips it over
[24:36.240 --> 24:42.480]  into figuring out how to better utilize these shared spaces to do content like this. My
[24:42.480 --> 24:46.940]  Avengers story, I'm going to break your heart here, newborn dad. It's the first Avengers
[24:46.940 --> 24:50.720]  movie that I didn't go see with my son, because he went he wanted to go with his friends.
[24:50.720 --> 24:56.360]  Yes, that will be extremely sad. I mean, I'm, I'm gearing up for all the fun stuff that
[24:56.360 --> 25:00.400]  we're gonna get to do in the next, you know, many years, but all the Disney movies, right,
[25:00.400 --> 25:05.980]  the Pixar movies, Harry Potter, all that kind of fun stuff is, is what I'm greatly looking
[25:05.980 --> 25:11.200]  forward to. And then I know that at one point, it will get to the point you're at,
[25:11.200 --> 25:17.280]  I am telling you the truth, mg, I choked up because he, he, he's such a good kid. And
[25:17.280 --> 25:20.400]  he knew, you know, he knew that it's a thing that we had, and I was already planning on
[25:20.400 --> 25:24.860]  getting tickets for us. And he didn't ask if he could go, what he did is he texted me
[25:24.860 --> 25:29.800]  and just said, Hey, some of my friends are getting tickets to go see the Avengers. Yeah,
[25:29.800 --> 25:34.200]  I immediately just wrote go, you know, exclamation mark. And I went up and said, Hey, you know,
[25:34.200 --> 25:38.280]  you need help ordering, you know, you know, do you want my credit card? What do you need
[25:38.280 --> 25:42.000]  to do? You know, and I was like, just go, you know, I was like, Do not worry about me.
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.800]  But then I went downstairs and had a sob.
[25:44.800 --> 25:50.720]  Oh, yeah. Okay. Well, that's good. That's good for me to remember.
[25:50.720 --> 25:56.320]  Another one. I mean, and Joan, Jonas has always been. He's a gentle kid. He really is. He
[25:56.320 --> 26:00.960]  always was. He was never like a rough and tumble kid. And so we let him watch movies
[26:00.960 --> 26:06.800]  that a lot of other parents wouldn't let watch movies at a pretty young age. And I don't
[26:06.800 --> 26:10.560]  you know, he wasn't like we're pushing him on him. I just think he was fine. I think
[26:10.560 --> 26:15.440]  other parents, you know, other parenting styles, I pass no judgment. But Jonas watched movies
[26:15.440 --> 26:20.680]  like Star Wars and stuff starting at like the age of three or four. So he was in kindergarten,
[26:20.680 --> 26:26.560]  he'd already seen Iron Man. And I went, I told him that he had a dentist appointment
[26:26.560 --> 26:30.320]  in the afternoon. So yeah, I'd be picking them up at lunch. And I went to get them at
[26:30.320 --> 26:34.800]  lunch. And I said, we're not going to the dentist. I got, I got tickets for Iron Man
[26:34.800 --> 26:43.480]  to me like, really? And I was like, Oh, yeah. And we went to see Iron Man, too. And I didn't.
[26:43.480 --> 26:47.360]  I'm not like I was never been a prankster parent. I've never been, you know, and like,
[26:47.360 --> 26:50.800]  I was telling a friend of the show, john molts about this. And he was like, well, that's
[26:50.800 --> 26:55.520]  better than the opposite. The type of parent who says, Hey, we're going to see our root
[26:55.520 --> 27:03.080]  canal. I've never been the jokey parent. I just didn't trust him to have a good poker
[27:03.080 --> 27:06.380]  face with the teacher because I kind of didn't want to be the dad who the teacher knew was
[27:06.380 --> 27:12.880]  taking kids. Yeah. Friday afternoon. That's amazing. I am totally stealing that. Hopefully
[27:12.880 --> 27:18.120]  Maisie's not listening to this in six years or something. And yeah, I'll be able to surprise
[27:18.120 --> 27:19.120]  her.
[27:19.120 --> 27:19.840]  Parenting tips from
[27:19.840 --> 27:26.560]  Alright, let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor. They're back from last
[27:26.560 --> 27:31.480]  week things one of my very favorite apps last week, I told you a lot about their Mac app.
[27:31.480 --> 27:34.720]  This week, I'm gonna tell you a little bit more about their iOS app. But look, things
[27:34.720 --> 27:41.280]  is a long standing, multi time Apple design award winning, basically a to do app, task
[27:41.280 --> 27:46.180]  manager something to organize everything from like a shopping list to bigger projects. beautifully
[27:46.180 --> 27:50.400]  designed has always been beautiful with truly native apps for the Mac, iPhone, iPad, they
[27:50.400 --> 27:55.980]  have a great Apple Watch app, simple to use as lots and lots of power. And this power
[27:55.980 --> 28:01.020]  extends to their iOS apps in a big way. You know that feeling where you want to accomplish
[28:01.020 --> 28:04.000]  something you got something to do, but you think I'll just wait till I get back to my
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.520]  Mac. I do this all the time with a lot of things. We could turn this whole show into
[28:08.520 --> 28:13.940]  that. Well, that's something that things wanted to address. And they really went deep on how
[28:13.940 --> 28:17.640]  they can reduce that friction on iPhone and iPad and make you just do it right be able
[28:17.640 --> 28:21.400]  to do it right there. And so their apps are full of clever solutions to help you achieve
[28:21.400 --> 28:26.760]  this. But they want me to tell you about just to the first is the magic plus button. This
[28:26.760 --> 28:30.440]  is brilliant. I never would have thought of this and it gets super clever. Alright, something
[28:30.440 --> 28:34.320]  you do all the time in list apps of any kind, any kind of app or you make lists, you insert
[28:34.320 --> 28:38.980]  new items, but you want to put them in a certain spot. In most apps, it's really cumbersome,
[28:38.980 --> 28:43.720]  you do the plus button, you enter your you to do item text, and then it's all the way
[28:43.720 --> 28:47.580]  at the top, right, but you want it somewhere else. So then you have to tap an Edit button.
[28:47.580 --> 28:51.160]  And then there's like a little drag handle that shows up and then you can drag it down
[28:51.160 --> 28:57.500]  to where you want it to be. What a pain in things. You can drag the plus button itself
[28:57.500 --> 29:02.040]  to where you want your to do to go. So you just go to the plus button, drag it down into
[29:02.040 --> 29:07.040]  the list and let go when it's at the right spot. Type your to do, boom, you're done.
[29:07.040 --> 29:11.800]  And it's in the right spot. Brilliant. What a great shortcut. Here's the other thing they
[29:11.800 --> 29:16.700]  have full keyboard control on the iPad. So if you use your iPad with an external keyboard,
[29:16.700 --> 29:21.960]  you know that most apps don't have great keyboard support. That's from things a little read
[29:21.960 --> 29:28.040]  for me. I would say that is an understatement. To say the least, things is incredible in
[29:28.040 --> 29:32.240]  this regard. They've got loads of shortcuts for creating to do's setting dates, adding
[29:32.240 --> 29:37.500]  tags, filters, and so on. You can list all the commands. Now this is something system
[29:37.500 --> 29:41.520]  wide on the iPad. You just hold down the command key and you wait a little bit and you get
[29:41.520 --> 29:45.820]  little HUD display that tells you all the available keyboard shortcuts, which is a really
[29:45.820 --> 29:50.840]  great idea is system wide, but it's not that great if you don't have a lot of shortcuts.
[29:50.840 --> 29:55.020]  Well, things does. You can learn them very easily. Just hold down the command key. All
[29:55.020 --> 30:00.040]  of this stuff is accessible from the keyboard and you can use your arrow keys to select
[30:00.040 --> 30:03.520]  items. You shift all the stuff that works on the Mac. It all works on things on the
[30:03.520 --> 30:08.480]  iPad. You shift with the arrow keys to select multiple items. You can move items up and
[30:08.480 --> 30:13.960]  down and list all by the keyboard. It's great. Even their popovers are fully accessible from
[30:13.960 --> 30:18.560]  the keyboard. There's a really cool feature called type travel. You simply start typing
[30:18.560 --> 30:23.920]  where you want to go, like the name of a project or an area or another list and you're automatically
[30:23.920 --> 30:27.880]  just taken there just by typing the name of it. It's amazing how much you can do in things
[30:27.880 --> 30:32.000]  without even lifting your hand off the keyboard, which is a huge deal once you've got your
[30:32.000 --> 30:36.480]  iPad propped up and you've got a hardware keyboard connected. It is seriously a very,
[30:36.480 --> 30:44.240]  very powerful peer to the Mac app on the iPad. I wish more iPad apps would take this sort
[30:44.240 --> 30:48.600]  of keyboard support as seriously as things does. So those are just two examples of how
[30:48.600 --> 30:54.280]  things delivers a powerful experience on iOS and there's so much more head over to things
[30:54.280 --> 31:00.560]  app dot com and you can get things for iOS. Try it for yourself and you can also download
[31:00.560 --> 31:06.600]  a free trial for the Mac at things app dot com. Check it out today. One of my favorite
[31:06.600 --> 31:12.200]  apps. I use it every day. I really do. Alright, so let's go back to Apple in this. What do
[31:12.200 --> 31:14.800]  you think Apple is going to do on this front? And do you think Apple is going to go HBO
[31:14.800 --> 31:17.800]  style and release shows once a week or you think they're going to go Netflix style and
[31:17.800 --> 31:26.560]  dump them? I would guess that they do more HBO style. I don't know why exactly I feel
[31:26.560 --> 31:31.440]  that way other than I think that's what they should do. I think given what we know now
[31:31.440 --> 31:35.200]  or what we think we know what they're trying to do, right, there's obviously a lot still
[31:35.200 --> 31:40.700]  to be determined, including price and and a bunch of other key key things. But it does
[31:40.700 --> 31:45.020]  seem like it's less and people have been saying this, right, that it's less of a Netflix competitor
[31:45.020 --> 31:49.800]  and more of an HBO type play and also more of an Amazon type play, right, where it's
[31:49.800 --> 31:55.200]  like the channel bundling on top of everything. And so given all of that, I do think that
[31:55.200 --> 32:01.640]  the HBO model makes a lot more sense. Do you think so too? I do too. And I know I'm sure
[32:01.640 --> 32:05.880]  that there are some people out there who love the Netflix style. They love the dump and
[32:05.880 --> 32:10.660]  they're going to say, Well, john, if you want to watch it once a week, just pick a time,
[32:10.660 --> 32:14.200]  pick your favorite day of the week and watch one episode of Stranger Things, you know,
[32:14.200 --> 32:19.120]  doled them out yourself one, one episode a week. It doesn't but that's part of the experience
[32:19.120 --> 32:23.320]  isn't just me watching once a week. It's like what we've you and I've been talking about
[32:23.320 --> 32:27.360]  here. It's this collective experience and shared, you know, give it a day or two for
[32:27.360 --> 32:31.320]  people to catch up and you can start reading, you know, stuff on Twitter or the recaps and
[32:31.320 --> 32:36.520]  stuff like that. Yep. See what people think is going on. I also think it gives them a
[32:36.520 --> 32:41.000]  nice leverage point of if they do if they are in fact, it seems like they're doing you
[32:41.000 --> 32:45.600]  know, the upsell of the of the other channels. If you do it this way, you're basically giving
[32:45.600 --> 32:50.680]  people an avenue to come into the app every single week, right to catch up with the show.
[32:50.680 --> 32:54.080]  And then afterwards, they have to watch something else or they're likely going to, you know,
[32:54.080 --> 32:57.680]  some people, of course, won't put the but a lot of people will and because they can't
[32:57.680 --> 33:00.960]  watch that very next episode of what they were just watching. Maybe they'll poke around
[33:00.960 --> 33:05.680]  and be like, Oh, yeah, we should watch what's next on Showtime, right? Or check out one
[33:05.680 --> 33:09.960]  of these other shows on Apple TV or whatever. But yeah, if you could definitely if they
[33:09.960 --> 33:17.680]  if the if they can steer you towards, you know, I forget if CBS is already signed up
[33:17.680 --> 33:20.840]  for the TV app, but you know, maybe check out the Star Trek that you haven't haven't
[33:20.840 --> 33:26.180]  watched yet or something like that. Yeah, I don't know. I just feel to me that the Netflix
[33:26.180 --> 33:32.520]  style is it's almost tragic, you know, that they make these wonderful shows and don't
[33:32.520 --> 33:38.220]  give them the space to breathe. Yeah, I mean, I'm sure you run across it too. It's like
[33:38.220 --> 33:42.800]  Megan and I, like every time we sit down to watch something, if we don't have something
[33:42.800 --> 33:48.480]  in mind, it's just like we're going through the Netflix app. And it's like, I mean, I
[33:48.480 --> 33:51.680]  can't believe that this person's in this thing. Like, I've never even heard of this, like,
[33:51.680 --> 33:55.480]  can't believe this person's in this thing. And I've never heard of this. There's so many,
[33:55.480 --> 33:59.520]  so many things. And it really, I mean, it's like, it's not only the, you know, sort of
[33:59.520 --> 34:06.280]  the abundance of choice problem. It's like that to, to such an extreme that I don't know,
[34:06.280 --> 34:10.500]  I don't even know, like what the end game is of that, right? Like, do they get so good
[34:10.500 --> 34:14.600]  at the algorithms to recommend to you that it doesn't matter? And so like, they have
[34:14.600 --> 34:19.400]  people to watch all of these things. It seems like they, I just feel like that's untenable.
[34:19.400 --> 34:23.680]  Like at some point, we're going to hit a limit of how many shows they can actually have.
[34:23.680 --> 34:29.080]  Yeah. Like I wrote the other day, writing about this, I described Netflix as catalog
[34:29.080 --> 34:34.440]  as effectively infinite. And I didn't expound on that, but I don't think I need to write
[34:34.440 --> 34:42.540]  like, I think even if you were independently wealthy, or retired, and could literally just
[34:42.540 --> 34:48.340]  wake up and start watching Netflix, and then go to bed and wake up and watch Netflix, you'll
[34:48.340 --> 34:53.320]  never catch up. You'll be further behind. Once you you know, by day one, you'll be further
[34:53.320 --> 34:55.160]  behind than you were when you started.
[34:55.160 --> 35:00.360]  Yeah. And I sort of wonder if I guess that. So eventually, all of the players are, you
[35:00.360 --> 35:04.760]  would presume most of them are going to pull their content, right? Like friends, they just
[35:04.760 --> 35:08.880]  resigned, but it was a massive deal. And Disney is pulling all their content, as we know,
[35:08.880 --> 35:13.440]  to do Disney Plus. And so eventually, it's just not going to be tenable to have all of
[35:13.440 --> 35:17.080]  these other bits of content. And it's all going to be Netflix content. And what are
[35:17.080 --> 35:20.960]  they doing right now? They're building up a library of content the world has never seen
[35:20.960 --> 35:26.380]  before, the size of which the world has never seen before. And so it won't matter so much
[35:26.380 --> 35:29.960]  if all these people pull off their content, because you have so much else that you couldn't
[35:29.960 --> 35:30.960]  possibly watch.
[35:30.960 --> 35:40.460]  Yeah, it's in some ways, I really feel like, like anything successful, they you know, HBO,
[35:40.460 --> 35:45.540]  it is sort of like Showtime, but it's different. I mean, it's the same basic idea. It started
[35:45.540 --> 35:50.520]  life as a cable channel that you have to pay extra money to and they have a bunch of real
[35:50.520 --> 35:56.960]  theatrical movies available at any given time. And sometimes they have boxing and, you know,
[35:56.960 --> 36:03.520]  but have, you know, in recent years have really made a name by their original content. And
[36:03.520 --> 36:07.960]  but HBO is HBO, right? They've sort of made their own brand Netflix even more so because
[36:07.960 --> 36:15.980]  they're undefined by any previous tie to, to real, quote unquote, real TV. It's its
[36:15.980 --> 36:20.280]  own thing. Like it's it's not that useful to me. I don't think it'll in the long run
[36:20.280 --> 36:26.120]  to compare Apple TV plus to Netflix or Netflix is just it's just bizarre. But if you're going
[36:26.120 --> 36:30.600]  to compare it to anything, I almost feel like the only thing you can compare it to is YouTube.
[36:30.600 --> 36:36.080]  Because YouTube content is very different than Netflix content. But But the thing that's
[36:36.080 --> 36:42.120]  unique about those two is that they are literally infinite content wells and they promote you
[36:42.120 --> 36:46.920]  know, they try to get you to just keep going, right? You get to the end of the video. But
[36:46.920 --> 36:50.880]  their guesses are pretty good. Usually, you know, the little things on the right on YouTube
[36:50.880 --> 36:55.720]  are usually pretty appealing to me. After I've watched something. Yeah, that's, that's
[36:55.720 --> 37:02.000]  a good way to frame it. I know they are both similar in the infinite content, you almost
[37:02.000 --> 37:07.000]  feel like, do we do we get to a state of equilibrium? Because we I think we all agree that everyone's
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.120]  going to have a subset of these, right? So everyone already has YouTube because it's
[37:11.120 --> 37:14.880]  free. There's obviously the YouTube red stuff. But just say you have YouTube because it's
[37:14.880 --> 37:19.640]  free. Everyone has Netflix, of course, because you basically need to these days. A lot of
[37:19.640 --> 37:24.720]  people probably the majority of people are going to get Disney plus Apple TV plus will
[37:24.720 --> 37:32.480]  probably be a smaller subset, not too dissimilar to how HBO is a smaller subset. But then I
[37:32.480 --> 37:38.060]  wonder like, is there a mechanism between the types of content and or the stars of these
[37:38.060 --> 37:42.200]  things that they move between them sort of fluidly, right? So someone might break their
[37:42.200 --> 37:47.860]  career on YouTube, and then get a Netflix show and or then get and then if their Netflix
[37:47.860 --> 37:53.620]  show works, do they go to the prestige show of HBO and or Apple TV plus type thing? Does
[37:53.620 --> 37:57.240]  it does it sort of play out that way? I think Netflix would not like that. YouTube certainly
[37:57.240 --> 38:01.520]  wouldn't like that. But it's almost feels like that's that's a ladder you can you can
[38:01.520 --> 38:04.760]  sort of see forming. Yeah.
[38:04.760 --> 38:12.120]  I've seen a very frequently asked question for me in the last month is or at least maybe
[38:12.120 --> 38:18.820]  it's weeks because I forget when Disney unveiled Disney plus but post Disney plus announcement.
[38:18.820 --> 38:23.600]  And the first time I got the question, I thought it was so I see the appeal from a consumer
[38:23.600 --> 38:29.380]  perspective. But I it seems so outlandish from Disney's perspective that I can't believe
[38:29.380 --> 38:33.440]  anybody would ask but I've since been asked at least half a dozen times is do I think
[38:33.440 --> 38:38.540]  Disney and Apple work out some kind of deal where you can pay 10 bucks a month and get
[38:38.540 --> 38:46.380]  Apple TV plus and Disney plus? Yeah. And the consumer angle is, is obvious. It's subscription
[38:46.380 --> 38:54.700]  fatigue. And and both both just from the purely rational perspective of wanting to minimize
[38:54.700 --> 39:05.120]  your monthly subscription expenditure, and the more subjective sense of just the sense
[39:05.120 --> 39:10.400]  of feeling like you're getting nickel and dimed. Yep. So I see the appeal of that. But
[39:10.400 --> 39:17.160]  I don't see why Disney would ever go for that. At a sum of money, you know, at at at 699
[39:17.160 --> 39:21.520]  for the regular subscription, they're already being super aggressive. Like, yeah, they're
[39:21.520 --> 39:26.060]  not gonna cut into that with by partnering with Apple. They don't need to. Yeah, I mean,
[39:26.060 --> 39:29.560]  you could argue because Bob Iger is obviously still on the board of Apple. And that was
[39:29.560 --> 39:33.460]  brought up recently as like, is that a conflict? And he still says no. And we'll see if that
[39:33.460 --> 39:38.960]  how that plays out as things move forward. But I think that's what they used to say about
[39:38.960 --> 39:43.800]  Eric Schmidt and Google. All right. And so I have a feeling that will play out maybe
[39:43.800 --> 39:47.120]  in a similar way, though, who knows, because Bob Iger set to retire, right at some point
[39:47.120 --> 39:50.280]  in the next couple of years, if he doesn't extend again, which seems like he's not but
[39:50.280 --> 39:54.920]  anyway, the subscription fatigue thing is interesting. I do think that a bunch of them
[39:54.920 --> 40:00.320]  will end up partnering. So like, we've already seen this in in cross content, polinization
[40:00.320 --> 40:05.880]  with, like Spotify teams up with Hulu, right to do like sort of a package offering. And
[40:05.880 --> 40:10.920]  so would we see that between bundles? Obviously, Disney is going to do their own bundle with
[40:10.920 --> 40:17.440]  Disney Plus, ESPN Plus, and then Hulu. But do they cross pollinate and have different
[40:17.440 --> 40:21.900]  different offerings? I think no. And again, I think from Apple's perspective, they want
[40:21.900 --> 40:27.440]  to try what the Amazon model has been of just upselling the channels, and maybe they sell
[40:27.440 --> 40:33.040]  them at a different rates or a discount. And maybe there's been some whispers, right, that
[40:33.040 --> 40:37.660]  they can figure out a way to bundle some of those together to create their own like newfangled
[40:37.660 --> 40:42.120]  like HBO Plus stars or something like that. Maybe there is something to that. But I don't
[40:42.120 --> 40:48.100]  think Yeah, that that Disney and, and Apple TV Plus, Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus will
[40:48.100 --> 40:52.620]  bundle together unless one of them just isn't working, or both of them are not working,
[40:52.620 --> 40:59.720]  and they need a way to, you know, to sort of change the the sales equation. Yeah. I
[40:59.720 --> 41:04.640]  still think I had Peter Kafka on a couple weeks ago to talk about this stuff. And he
[41:04.640 --> 41:12.380]  he remained not convinced, but his his bet is still on Apple, releasing Apple TV Plus,
[41:12.380 --> 41:17.500]  free that they're not going to charge to that. And I would love Yeah, I know your perspective
[41:17.500 --> 41:21.820]  is different on this. And mine is to I don't think I think there's no way they do it for
[41:21.820 --> 41:28.780]  free. I think that they have some parts of it that might be free. Like one show. But
[41:28.780 --> 41:33.220]  given the whole narrative right now is around services, I think it would, it would just
[41:33.220 --> 41:36.760]  undercut their their argument that they're trying to make to Wall Street and everyone
[41:36.760 --> 41:41.320]  else that they're a services company now if they just released this for free, like, yes,
[41:41.320 --> 41:45.940]  it would be good lead gen to do this this channel selling model, which is maybe the
[41:45.940 --> 41:50.520]  real moneymaker. But I don't I just I don't think that that's what they're going to do.
[41:50.520 --> 41:55.220]  I think that it's going to be definitely a paid offering. And I think that they'll have
[41:55.220 --> 41:58.500]  their own bundle, which they will be, you know, they're sort of one more thing when
[41:58.500 --> 42:02.900]  they talk about it further in the fall that they'll have iCloud mixed with this mix with
[42:02.900 --> 42:04.740]  some other things to be able to bundle together.
[42:04.740 --> 42:14.140]  Right? It's like, it is. It's, I'm not complaining because it is fantastic grist for a podcaster
[42:14.140 --> 42:20.040]  and a commentator on the company that they had this announcement where they brought out
[42:20.040 --> 42:25.100]  all these stars and then never told us if they're going to pay charge for it, or if
[42:25.100 --> 42:33.540]  they are what. So in a sense, I'm not complaining because this is fantastic. I'm going to get
[42:33.540 --> 42:38.740]  hours out of this also. This is great. I can see it either way. And then I kind of feel
[42:38.740 --> 42:42.220]  like like Peter had me convinced like, yeah, they're just going to release this for free
[42:42.220 --> 42:48.800]  to get people in the boat. And it's basic idea isn't that Apple is magnanimously going
[42:48.800 --> 42:54.460]  to make Apple TV plus free of charge. His theory is where they want the only place where
[42:54.460 --> 43:01.100]  they want to make money in TV is selling the other subscriptions with their 15% cut. Right?
[43:01.100 --> 43:07.500]  So right, get you in the Apple TV app by selling you on the Jennifer Aniston morning show.
[43:07.500 --> 43:12.620]  And you find out all your friends are talking about that show. And so you go and watch it.
[43:12.620 --> 43:18.820]  And then you're you're in the app, and you're a button click or two. And you know, if you
[43:18.820 --> 43:26.420]  have an Apple TV, a couple of awkward swipes. You're about that you're a button or two from
[43:26.420 --> 43:34.380]  signing up for other those channels as they call them. And then you're on the hook for
[43:34.380 --> 43:38.740]  recurring revenue because now you're paying through your iTunes account, you're paying
[43:38.740 --> 43:47.280]  10 or 15 or $20 a month to get ESPN and Hulu and whatever other channels you've decided
[43:47.280 --> 43:51.860]  you want to you know, CBS interactive, whatever the CBS thing is called, which right, I keep
[43:51.860 --> 43:54.680]  procrastinating. I want to watch that Star Trek show and I keep procrastinating on it
[43:54.680 --> 43:58.140]  because I'm waiting for this TV app to do it. So I don't have to manage a different
[43:58.140 --> 44:04.580]  account time to I'm 100% with you there too. What if they did something like if you bought
[44:04.580 --> 44:11.260]  the Apple TV for $200 this is baked in for a year. If you're but if you're going to because
[44:11.260 --> 44:16.140]  we already know these this app is going to, you know, exist on Samsung TVs and Roku and
[44:16.140 --> 44:22.460]  a bunch of other Sony Amazon. Yeah, yeah, right. And so what if then it's a paid thing?
[44:22.460 --> 44:25.500]  Because like, how could they do that? I mean, you could say that they could do that for
[44:25.500 --> 44:30.780]  free because it's still trying to do the channels upsell but that seems a lot more murky. I
[44:30.780 --> 44:34.540]  don't think that they're going to do it for free across the board. I could see a world
[44:34.540 --> 44:40.180]  in which they release it in a way that sort of appears to be free because it's baked into
[44:40.180 --> 44:44.780]  if you buy Apple TV hardware, maybe the iPad, maybe they have some sort of deal on it, maybe
[44:44.780 --> 44:48.740]  you get six months free or something like that. But I also just think from the the other
[44:48.740 --> 44:53.220]  perspective, like the creators perspective, I think they think that they're making, you
[44:53.220 --> 44:58.080]  know, very prestigious programming. And I don't think that they want to be tied to sort
[44:58.080 --> 45:03.500]  of a free offering necessarily, knowing that the end game of that is probably not not a
[45:03.500 --> 45:08.900]  good a good outcome. Ultimately, if Apple ever decides they're not going to pay, you
[45:08.900 --> 45:15.300]  know, all the money to them off, just out of their their pockets. Yeah. I don't know,
[45:15.300 --> 45:21.900]  you know, and and surely, there is going to be I say this because but Apple often surprises
[45:21.900 --> 45:26.180]  us these days and doesn't do the obvious thing. Well, one thing I will just say is that Peter
[45:26.180 --> 45:30.700]  had me convinced that maybe they'll just give it away. And then I like, the next morning
[45:30.700 --> 45:35.500]  woke up and I was just like, that can't be for all the reasons. Yeah. And then I thought,
[45:35.500 --> 45:39.420]  what's what's the most obvious Apple thing to do? And I thought, well, the most obvious
[45:39.420 --> 45:45.240]  Apple thing to do would be to charge way more than anybody thinks. Right? Like charge charge
[45:45.240 --> 45:51.020]  enough per month that there will be like gasps in the audience. And it feels premium then
[45:51.020 --> 45:55.220]  and like, you know, there's trickle down effects of this, even if they don't. I mean, even
[45:55.220 --> 45:59.460]  if the model is ultimately what Peter's saying, and I agree with that, that it is like likely
[45:59.460 --> 46:03.780]  to upsell these subscriptions for the channels. And it's the same thing that Amazon does.
[46:03.780 --> 46:08.380]  The difference is Amazon gets away with with it being sort of quote, unquote, free, if
[46:08.380 --> 46:12.500]  you have prime, which everyone does, right. Apple doesn't have the equivalent of that.
[46:12.500 --> 46:16.340]  So the only way to see that working is if they, they baked in, you know, eventually,
[46:16.340 --> 46:19.900]  when they have their Apple prime thing, this is one subset of that. And so it's sort of
[46:19.900 --> 46:24.420]  considered free, even though it's baked into that. Right. Right. Maybe something like that.
[46:24.420 --> 46:29.020]  Yeah, that's what I think is, I think that what Apple needs is their equivalent of prime,
[46:29.020 --> 46:37.580]  where you to, you know, to get everybody paying a greater than $10 a month monthly fee, but
[46:37.580 --> 46:44.220]  less than 10 plus 10 plus 10 to get the news and to get the arcade and to get the TV and
[46:44.220 --> 46:50.980]  of course, to get music, you know, the original Apple media service, right. So you know, if
[46:50.980 --> 46:55.820]  you had music news arcade, they didn't give a price for arcade either. But I'm guessing
[46:55.820 --> 46:59.980]  that might be as if it's the only thing you sign up for, I'm going to guess $10 a month.
[46:59.980 --> 47:03.660]  And if TVs $10 a month, now you're up at 40 bucks a month. And if they sold the whole
[47:03.660 --> 47:08.820]  thing for $25 a month, yeah, great deal. And you got all of them, you got all four of them.
[47:08.820 --> 47:14.180]  All of a sudden, it feels like a good deal, right? That feels like a really good deal.
[47:14.180 --> 47:18.020]  And you can mix and match. I don't know. But you know, if you could just like, if you really
[47:18.020 --> 47:22.920]  don't want the news, or you don't play games, you don't want the arcade, you just want TV
[47:22.920 --> 47:27.200]  and music, if you could get it for less than 20, if you could just pay 15 or something
[47:27.200 --> 47:30.740]  like that, that might be, I don't know, that might be a way around. I could totally see
[47:30.740 --> 47:36.340]  that happening. Right? I'll give one other quick argument on of what Peter's trying to
[47:36.340 --> 47:41.080]  argue for that I could see is okay, so I was actually just reading an interview with with
[47:41.080 --> 47:46.060]  Oprah, I think it was in the Hollywood Reporter today. She talked a little bit about Apple,
[47:46.060 --> 47:49.760]  it's it's mostly other stuff, but a little bit in there. But it was interesting to me
[47:49.760 --> 47:53.780]  because she reiterates what of course, she famously said on stage, the billion pockets
[47:53.780 --> 47:58.620]  y'all, she sort of sort of, you know, talks about that a little bit again. And the way
[47:58.620 --> 48:02.760]  that she talks about it is that basically, why she's so excited to work with Apple is
[48:02.760 --> 48:08.820]  because they open up a an audience that is unparalleled in size because of the device
[48:08.820 --> 48:14.720]  reach, right. And so you could see a world in which Apple is selling to Hollywood, that
[48:14.720 --> 48:18.320]  exact thing, and I'm sure they are right, that that's the main selling point that we
[48:18.320 --> 48:23.180]  have a billion devices out the billion plus devices out there, and you can access all
[48:23.180 --> 48:29.660]  of them. And so if they're trying to say that reach is the most important thing, of course,
[48:29.660 --> 48:34.860]  free would be the most the easiest way to get to that full reach. And so that's really
[48:34.860 --> 48:39.860]  the only argument I could see them making for doing it as a free service if they're
[48:39.860 --> 48:44.700]  saying, Hey, so this thing is going to be free, but we're going to launch it to a billion
[48:44.700 --> 48:50.340]  plus users, or several hundred million users. And you're going to have access like you've
[48:50.340 --> 48:56.220]  never had before to eyeballs. But still, I think that that is a short term gain for sort
[48:56.220 --> 48:59.940]  of long term pain for anyone who's thinking savvy enough about it.
[48:59.940 --> 49:06.980]  Yeah, and my dream and I, I've, I've been so beaten down by the five gigabyte free tier
[49:06.980 --> 49:11.620]  of iTunes that I no longer, I no longer have any vim and vigor when arguing about it. But
[49:11.620 --> 49:16.660]  my dream would be if they slipped iCloud in there to into this prime thing and sign up
[49:16.660 --> 49:21.940]  for this stuff that you think is fun, like listening to unlimited music and watching
[49:21.940 --> 49:28.100]  cool TV shows, and you'll get an upgrade to your storage tier in iTunes, and you'll be
[49:28.100 --> 49:34.300]  able to have all of your photos backed up in the cloud, which is like a good healthy
[49:34.300 --> 49:39.460]  thing that nobody really nobody really feels like it's a fun way to spend 299 a month to
[49:39.460 --> 49:47.700]  get it up. But it's great. And Apple is the unique structure of Apple where they don't
[49:47.700 --> 49:55.800]  have financial silos, you know, where there's nobody who's in charge of iCloud, who's going
[49:55.800 --> 50:00.420]  to be mad because it was his independent, his or her independent fiefdom. In fact, it's
[50:00.420 --> 50:06.500]  the same guy. It's Eddie Q. Right. Eddie, make this happen, right? Yeah, they are uniquely
[50:06.500 --> 50:10.180]  positioned to do that. You're totally right. And you can even see them like harkening back
[50:10.180 --> 50:14.620]  to the, you know, the old school, like I life suites, you know, like where they bundle things
[50:14.620 --> 50:20.540]  together and offer it in like an experience mode, not so much like all these things individually.
[50:20.540 --> 50:25.980]  It's all about Yeah, having fun, like you say. Yeah. So that would be I just feel like
[50:25.980 --> 50:31.940]  it would be a nice, it would make the overall experience of the typical user so much better.
[50:31.940 --> 50:37.620]  And just by having all of their photos in the cloud. And I guess I misspoke a couple
[50:37.620 --> 50:44.420]  episodes ago. And like I, I put forth the hypothetical theory of a person who's buying
[50:44.420 --> 50:48.080]  a new iPhone, and they've got more than five gigabytes, way more than five gigabytes of
[50:48.080 --> 50:52.660]  photos and videos. And I thought, you know, I think I put it in a way that made it sound
[50:52.660 --> 50:57.420]  like they were screwed. They're not if you go to the Apple store, and you don't have
[50:57.420 --> 51:02.100]  a backup that has all of your stuff, they all do it for you right there in the store
[51:02.100 --> 51:05.860]  through, you know, like a Mac or something, and they'll get your all of your stuff off
[51:05.860 --> 51:10.060]  your old phone, no matter how much it is onto your new phone there in the store. But hey,
[51:10.060 --> 51:13.320]  how many people do that? I mean, there must be millions and millions of people who have
[51:13.320 --> 51:19.420]  no idea that they could do that at the Apple store. And B, it doesn't solve the other problems
[51:19.420 --> 51:25.500]  that like that backup solves, like if your phone is lost or stolen or broken, you know,
[51:25.500 --> 51:29.700]  there's nothing you can do. Like your leave your phone in a cab, and you got to go get
[51:29.700 --> 51:32.980]  a new iPhone. If you don't have a backup, you've just lost your photos. Like there's
[51:32.980 --> 51:38.100]  digital tragedies that happen every day that could be solved if everybody just had a wee
[51:38.100 --> 51:45.300]  bit more. Yeah. And, you know, the ultimate extension of this is, of course, then including
[51:45.300 --> 51:51.620]  sort of a rolling iPhone subscription where you write a device every few years, right?
[51:51.620 --> 51:56.540]  Which, you know, they've definitely been working on. But if they could coordinate all of this
[51:56.540 --> 52:04.100]  and just sort of get you in to a very Amazon Prime like, you know, here, just give us this
[52:04.100 --> 52:09.420]  money on a regular basis. And we'll keep throwing TV shows at you. We'll keep throwing new iPhones
[52:09.420 --> 52:14.100]  at you every two years. How awesome would that be if like, they had a service that was
[52:14.100 --> 52:18.500]  so seamless that basically, you know, you check a box, you say, I want a new iPhone
[52:18.500 --> 52:22.880]  every year, or I want one every other year. And when that time comes, and when the launch
[52:22.880 --> 52:27.980]  date hits, you basically get a package in the mail with your new iPhone with all of
[52:27.980 --> 52:33.900]  your data already on it. Because they just did sort of a quick, you know, data transfer
[52:33.900 --> 52:38.460]  for you and told you basically, you know, stop using your iPhone after midnight tonight,
[52:38.460 --> 52:42.300]  and tomorrow morning, you're going to get a brand new one with all of your data sync
[52:42.300 --> 52:45.740]  from your iCloud account. How great of an experience would that be? That would be pretty
[52:45.740 --> 52:49.620]  great. I mean, Amazon does a great job with that. Like when you buy like a new Kindle,
[52:49.620 --> 52:54.860]  Kindle. Yeah, exactly. I just got the latest and gray. I'm on like an every four years
[52:54.860 --> 52:59.120]  Kindle cycle. Yeah. But it's nice because if you wait like four years, you really get
[52:59.120 --> 53:05.580]  like the screens are, you know, the backlighting on the screen is way better. And I'm always
[53:05.580 --> 53:09.220]  impressed by that. But I kind of feel like part of that is scale that they don't, you
[53:09.220 --> 53:12.120]  know, the iPhone comes at such scale, they couldn't do it. But maybe if you had this
[53:12.120 --> 53:15.740]  nice subscription service, they could afford to do it even at their scale. It would be
[53:15.740 --> 53:21.020]  really very, very nice just to open the box and have it already have your stuff on it.
[53:21.020 --> 53:26.020]  Yes, I think you were talking about that in a recent podcast, maybe even your last one
[53:26.020 --> 53:31.260]  where you talked about how good the the backup service has gotten via iCloud versus syncing
[53:31.260 --> 53:36.720]  on a on a computer. And it's funny because I almost feel like the opposite. So I just
[53:36.720 --> 53:41.520]  bought actually Megan a new iPhone basically to get the better the best camera, you know,
[53:41.520 --> 53:47.740]  so I bought her the XS to be able to get the best camera for taking pictures of the little
[53:47.740 --> 53:52.340]  one. And she's so reluctant to install. It's just sitting in a box right now, because she
[53:52.340 --> 53:58.020]  doesn't want to take the time to go through and do the new device sync thing. And I agree,
[53:58.020 --> 54:01.100]  it is a lot better than it used to be. Of course, you can do most of it over iCloud
[54:01.100 --> 54:06.580]  and it is relatively fast. But there are just little things like that they don't transfer
[54:06.580 --> 54:11.420]  every single password. And so there are some services that you have to log into again,
[54:11.420 --> 54:16.140]  and it's just like that inhibiting factor stops, I think people from from doing upgrades
[54:16.140 --> 54:20.400]  for sure. Yeah, there's certain services that obviously, I guess they're not storing their
[54:20.400 --> 54:25.620]  passwords in your keychain. I would hope that they're not really storing your password at
[54:25.620 --> 54:30.320]  all that there's instead of using the keychain, they're using some kind of, you know, localized
[54:30.320 --> 54:35.720]  token that wouldn't be reused. You know, I really hope that the apps that do this are
[54:35.720 --> 54:40.460]  not just stored in a password on their own, like in your preferences files. Right? Although
[54:40.460 --> 54:45.380]  you'd think that would transfer but you know, but or they do, you know, for some reason,
[54:45.380 --> 54:50.420]  some of these apps and services seem to want to create a unique identifier based on you
[54:50.420 --> 54:56.180]  and your device. And so when you go to a new device, you got to re log in and then yeah,
[54:56.180 --> 55:01.900]  you're right. It's as good as it's gotten, it still is a couple of weeks of pain. And
[55:01.900 --> 55:06.260]  then there's always the ones that you forget about, you know, I don't I don't use our nest
[55:06.260 --> 55:10.540]  app very frequently. But then it's like, I'll just, you know, like, after like a month,
[55:10.540 --> 55:14.820]  I have a new iPhone, I go to the nest app, and it's like, I'm back. I don't even remember
[55:14.820 --> 55:18.940]  if nest is one, but there's just those apps that you use, like once a month, and then
[55:18.940 --> 55:23.700]  it's just like, always the worst moment. Yeah, right. You need to minor the credit card apps.
[55:23.700 --> 55:27.140]  It's like, I want to I want to see if this payment went through. And it's like, I log
[55:27.140 --> 55:30.780]  in. It's like, Oh, my God, I forgot. I haven't installed it yet on the phone, like, blah,
[55:30.780 --> 55:35.020]  blah, blah. Yeah. Oh, I know one. Uber. For some reason, Uber doesn't just do it. And
[55:35.020 --> 55:38.660]  of course, the first time you notice, right? The first time you notice is when you're trying
[55:38.660 --> 55:43.900]  to get an Uber. Why else would you ever do open the Uber app? Yes, exactly. Yeah, right.
[55:43.900 --> 55:48.180]  And so it's like, we're, we're seven minutes away from our dinner reservation. And I'm
[55:48.180 --> 55:53.640]  like, and you have seven minutes of typing in a password. Yeah. And it's confirming this
[55:53.640 --> 55:57.920]  and that. It's like, Oh, my God, Jesus, there's probably like Ubers have just driven by my
[55:57.920 --> 56:04.260]  house already. I already missed them. Like, all right, let me take another break here
[56:04.260 --> 56:11.860]  and thank our next sponsor. It's a good time to break. It's Linode. I love this company.
[56:11.860 --> 56:18.340]  Linode lets you instantly deploy and manage SSD servers in the Linode cloud. I used to
[56:18.340 --> 56:21.460]  pronounce it line node because that's what it looks like. But of course, it's pronounced
[56:21.460 --> 56:26.580]  Linode because it's Linode like Linux. So me big dummy who doesn't know how to pronounce
[56:26.580 --> 56:31.220]  things, blew that one the last time they sponsored the show, but it looks like Linode l i n o
[56:31.220 --> 56:38.340]  t e. You can get a server running in seconds with your choice of Linux distribution resources
[56:38.340 --> 56:42.380]  and a choice of 10 node locations around the world. They're very proud to announce their
[56:42.380 --> 56:48.340]  newest data center in beautiful Toronto, Canada. It's built using their most up to date hardware.
[56:48.340 --> 56:53.640]  Their next generation network backbone Linode Toronto allows users to comply with in country
[56:53.640 --> 56:59.620]  data protection requirements while taking advantage of all Linode technology and tools.
[56:59.620 --> 57:03.700]  Very big, but that's a very big thing in today's modern world. Back in the early days, internet
[57:03.700 --> 57:06.780]  didn't matter where your server was, but now we've got all these laws around the world,
[57:06.780 --> 57:11.640]  which is good, but it certainly is. It makes things tricky when you're setting stuff up.
[57:11.640 --> 57:17.220]  If you've got to have your stuff in Canada, now you can do it. Uh, it's a great service.
[57:17.220 --> 57:22.940]  It really is. I'm a paying customer. I wouldn't say that if, if, if it weren't true, it has
[57:22.940 --> 57:26.800]  nothing to do with them sponsoring the show. I think that they are seriously the best hosting
[57:26.800 --> 57:32.160]  company out there today. Uh, here's what you get. You get a $20 credit for all new customers
[57:32.160 --> 57:37.080]  just for coming from the show. You can build it all on Linode, everything from a dedicated
[57:37.080 --> 57:42.340]  CPU, just distributed applications, hosted services, websites, anything you need. You
[57:42.340 --> 57:49.580]  can do it there. Everything uses SSD storage, 40 gigabit network, industry leading processors.
[57:49.580 --> 57:53.540]  And again, you get to pick from 10 worldwide data centers where you want your stuff hosted.
[57:53.540 --> 57:59.580]  Uh, their next one, their 11th is coming in Mumbai, India by the end of this year. So
[57:59.580 --> 58:03.900]  when I say worldwide, I mean it, that is about as far away from East coast us as you can
[58:03.900 --> 58:08.420]  get and you pay for what you use with hourly billing and plans and add on services. You
[58:08.420 --> 58:13.020]  can deploy your infrastructure effectively. If you need to burst, if you're expecting
[58:13.020 --> 58:18.580]  huge traffic, you can, you can budget for that and, and have it burst. Uh, they have
[58:18.580 --> 58:24.180]  a brand new cloud manager with a hugely improved user interface at cloud.lino.com. They have
[58:24.180 --> 58:29.420]  their own API for doing all sorts of nerdy stuff with your server and an officially supported
[58:29.420 --> 58:33.940]  Python command line interface, probably the most popular scripting language that you could
[58:33.940 --> 58:39.500]  do for something like that. And they're hiring, go to lino.com slash careers. If you're a,
[58:39.500 --> 58:44.020]  the type of person who might be interested in working for a world class hosting company,
[58:44.020 --> 58:48.980]  if you're a nerd, uh, you know, sys admin type looking for work, go check out lino.com
[58:48.980 --> 58:54.020]  slash careers. Probably a lot of you listening to this show. So again, you get a $20 credit
[58:54.020 --> 59:02.860]  when you use this promo code talk show 2019 no the just talk show 2019 you get $20 credit.
[59:02.860 --> 59:08.420]  You can start with a $5 a month plan and get a fantastic server. Uh, really, really effective
[59:08.420 --> 59:13.700]  server for five bucks a month with a $20 credit. You get four months free, four months. So
[59:13.700 --> 59:19.820]  my thanks to them. Go to lino.com slash the talk show. So the URL, this is tricky. You
[59:19.820 --> 59:25.380]  gotta be smart. Lino.com slash the talk show as the URL to go to. But then when you check
[59:25.380 --> 59:32.340]  out, you want to get that $20 credit. It's talk show 2019 my thanks to Linode in my opinion,
[59:32.340 --> 59:39.060]  the best hosting company in the world. I mean it. Anything else on the original content
[59:39.060 --> 59:46.460]  front. So the only thing I was gonna, uh, ask you for what you think about this because
[59:46.460 --> 59:51.780]  like I feel like no one's really had a good high level take, at least that I've read about
[59:51.780 --> 59:56.480]  it. But so obviously there's the famous thing I think in Walter Isaacson's book about Steve
[59:56.480 --> 01:00:01.420]  Jobs when he's on, uh, you know, unfortunately of course his deathbed, uh, talking about
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:07.360]  that he finally cracked, uh, cracked it right with regard to Apple television. And it's
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:11.600]  pretty clear I think to anyone who's been watching this long enough that what they're
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:17.760]  launching now is not what they actually intended to launch or what Steve Jobs was sort of referring
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:24.340]  to when he said they cracked it. Um, it seems more likely that that was sort of an interface,
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:29.660]  uh, or, or some sort of software mixed with the ability to, to work with Hollywood to
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:34.580]  create sort of the perfect new package that would ultimately replace cable. And you could
[01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:39.740]  argue that maybe it just wasn't the right time, you know, when, when, when that, uh,
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:44.020]  when you know, when unfortunately he passed away in 2010, right? So nine years ago already
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:50.100]  it was, uh, just not the right time for that to happen. Um, and maybe now is with, uh,
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:55.180]  with our just enough time has passed and obviously cable's under immense pressure, um, and just
[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:59.020]  things are unbundling and so maybe now is the right time. But it still seems like it's
[01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:03.920]  not exactly what Apple would have envisioned to do. And I think you could just see this
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:08.340]  by reading the reports over the years of at EQ meeting with so-and-so and so-and-so and
[01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:12.100]  Hollywood executives and, and they're not agreeing to sign up for this thing. And you
[01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:15.060]  can even see it in the product that it looks like they're releasing. And I know you and
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:19.180]  I had a funny back and forth. I think Kafka got involved too on Twitter where it was basically
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:26.580]  like, uh, can you actually launch any of these, uh, services like the Hulu service right from
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:31.500]  within the TV app? And it seems like, no, instead it kicks you out into it again. Right?
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:36.340]  So it's not seamless at all. No. Uh, all right. Let's, there's a lot to unpack there and this
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:42.980]  is a good topic. All right. I think that the, I cracked it line is, uh, I think there was
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:47.620]  no there there. I don't know what he was thinking. I, he might've had an idea. There might've
[01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:51.660]  been something, but I don't think people have read into it like from its last theorem. You
[01:01:51.660 --> 01:02:00.420]  know what I mean? Like it's just cause it's, we like to think that Steve jobs and maybe
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:04.780]  there are moments, there are moments in Apple and computing, personal computing history
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:12.540]  where he, he probably did have a Eureka moments, right? He's got it, you know, do, do something.
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:18.500]  Uh, I don't know what he was thinking of. It would be fascinating to someday get exactly
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:23.020]  what was it? Was it just something about, you know, for all we know it was the goddamn
[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:26.060]  remote control, you know what I mean? And he was like, we're going to put a touch pad
[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:33.100]  on the remote control and it's going to be bizarrely symmetric. You know, it could've
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:36.900]  been a terrible idea. I don't think, I think everybody read into that and it was the way
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:43.020]  it was written was, I mean, it was just, it was such a throwaway line and jobs of course
[01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:51.100]  was characteristically super confident. I cracked it. I got it. Uh, I don't think there
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:55.860]  was anything there and if he did or, or maybe he had a brilliant idea and they just could
[01:02:55.860 --> 01:03:01.740]  never get the content people on board, you know, so here's what I'll say. I'll just say
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:06.220]  this in the, it was 2011 when he died in the eight years, in the eight years since then,
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:09.800]  I don't think Apple's done anything to crack it. So whatever his idea was, either they
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:15.660]  didn't listen to him or it didn't, didn't work. Okay. So I agree with all of that. And
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:21.140]  I think that that's probably, you know, that is a, that is sort of the Occam's razor thing
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:27.660]  of, uh, that there is, is some, some combination of, he had just seen the latest work that
[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:32.200]  they, you know, that team was working on and it looked like it was in a good position,
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:35.640]  but they weren't able to get sort of the, you know, the Hollywood players on board and
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:39.940]  so they could never launch what they wanted to do. I had also heard way, but this is years
[01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:44.660]  ago, but back in the day I had heard about what they effectively launched as the remote
[01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:48.220]  control that now everyone hates is the touch remote control. I had heard about this years
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:52.700]  ago before it launched. I'd heard about it as a slight, it sounded when it was described
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:57.900]  to me as slightly different, more sort of almost more akin to the magic track pad, just
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:04.240]  a bigger full on track pad type thing. And you know, it ultimately became a smaller thing
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:08.860]  and more remote and with, with a few buttons of course, which presumably Jobs wouldn't
[01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:14.260]  have wanted. But, and so I think it's, I think you're right that it's a combination of all
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:19.740]  of these things that he thought he had some interesting sort of conceptual new way to
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:25.140]  interface with a TV. He thought he had a new UI for the TV and then he thought that once
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:30.020]  the Hollywood executive saw this package that they would have to sort of drop what they
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:34.720]  were doing and agree to it in, in the way that they did with iTunes. Right, right. And,
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:40.000]  but I, I think the bigger picture of where we stand today in 2019 and with this new TV
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:46.500]  app coming up is, is this, are you bouncing back and forth to multiple apps, you know,
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:51.520]  and, and they definitely, I don't think they, I always say this, I don't think Apple ever
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:55.900]  tries to mislead. I think that their marketing product marketing is scrupulously honest.
[01:04:55.900 --> 01:05:02.100]  Now, do they highlight the good and not talk about the bad? Of course, you know, they're
[01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:07.680]  marketers, but they don't lie. And so I think that that day one, there were some pages on
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:14.340]  the webpage, uh, apple.com that made it sound as though, uh, that when you went into this
[01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:19.600]  TV channels product, you wouldn't be bouncing between different apps that if you've got
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:25.860]  these channels and you want to go from the CBS interactive Star Trek to who lose that
[01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:31.340]  the handmaiden's tale, right, you would just skip from the one show to the other, not skip
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:36.260]  from the app between apps there. I forget the exact language. It doesn't matter. And
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:43.140]  within 24 hours it was subtly changed to, to not indicate that. Uh, I think it was a
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:45.860]  miscommunication. I don't think it was an attempt to mislead cause everybody's going
[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:49.980]  to know eventually there's no point in lying. I just think that the original copy was written
[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:54.460]  by someone who was thinking along the lines of us that it was supposed to work this way
[01:05:54.460 --> 01:06:00.940]  because bouncing between apps on apple TV is not great. No. So right then that's sort
[01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:04.460]  of my point. Like I think you're right with all of that a hundred percent. But I also
[01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:09.220]  think that what they wanted in their ideal state to do is what we're talking about.
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:13.520]  Yeah. Um, and even, you know, going, talking to about Kafka again, right. His report before
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:18.580]  this event, the most interesting thing about that report that he had back then was that
[01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:22.700]  apple would actually be hosting a lot of this content, right? From their own servers. And
[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:26.540]  that would imply of course that they were then just going to serve it up in the TV app
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:31.020]  and not make you go into a separate app because why would they host that content for a separate
[01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:33.980]  app? They would do it in their own app. And so they are obviously going to do that. It
[01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:39.420]  seems like for a few different content partners, but they really, for it to be a seamless experience
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:43.100]  and something that's great, they need to do it for all of the content partners and they
[01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:49.700]  clearly just couldn't get there. Yeah. There's just as a, to be a user interface nerd, there
[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:58.380]  is a conceptual complexity to bouncing between apps on apple TV. Uh, like there's just an
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:04.280]  extra cognitive load to that. And you know, in a sense they're competing against Netflix
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:09.780]  where Netflix is its own universe. And once you're in Netflix, you only bounce between
[01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:16.860]  shows. You're not bouncing out between apps. And like, I don't think the problem is that
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:23.180]  there needs to be a better app switching interface. I just think that the natural unit on, on
[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:30.540]  apple TV, if everybody would just agree to it is the show, not the app. Yes. A hundred
[01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:36.540]  a hundred percent. Right. And I think this is, this is sort of why I think I feel like
[01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:41.780]  apple's game plan after a decade of, of sort of failing to convince the Hollywood players
[01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:46.500]  to go along with their vision. I think they tried to do an end run around, which is basically
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:50.640]  like, okay, you guys know apps, you make them for the iPhone, you make them for the iPad.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:54.980]  Now you'll make them for the apple TV. And then they thought that eventually they would
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:59.020]  convince them that this isn't sort of the best way to do it. The best way to do it is
[01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:04.340]  to have a unified sort of a cable guide interface, right? Recreating sort of the cable bundle
[01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:09.260]  via via contents that they could serve up. They can do recommendations all from within
[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:13.900]  this TV app and they still just aren't there yet. And now they have a separate problem,
[01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:18.420]  which not only are all of the Hollywood guys not fully on board with that, they have the
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:21.580]  Netflix problem, which is that Netflix is always going to be a separate app. They will
[01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:27.320]  never agree to be a part of this. Yeah. I don't know. I wonder, I, I would guess that
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:31.900]  they asked, I mean, they obviously talked to Netflix and you know, who knows what the,
[01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:35.300]  you know, who knows what those negotiations were like with where Netflix decided we're
[01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:42.460]  going to stop taking iTunes signups. But like I, I, I say reported, but I've written this
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:49.540]  and I can, I can say it as fact or pretty close to fact that Netflix had a sweetheart
[01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:55.700]  deal where they were only paying 15% instead of 30% for a lot longer than the, than, than
[01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:59.980]  that was when they started talking about it. You started talking about it as a, Hey, you
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:06.100]  pay 30 for the first year and then 15 thereafter. Like I think, and I, this, I think I'm pretty
[01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:11.500]  sure that Netflix's deal was 15 from the start. It was, there was no first year of 30 and
[01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:16.820]  then 15 it was like for a while Netflix had, they just, you know, for iTunes signups, Apple
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:22.980]  only took 15% who knows why they stopped that. I guess they talked to Netflix and just tried
[01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:28.340]  to talk them into getting into the TV app. But I think Apple's smart enough to know that
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:30.180]  there's no way Netflix is going to go for that.
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:35.020]  Well, and I mean, there's a very obvious reason why beyond just the monetary aspect of it
[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:38.620]  and Netflix is entire business is built around data collection too, to be able to serve up
[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:43.340]  recommendations and create shows based on, you know, what people want. And so is Apple
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:47.140]  going to serve up a hundred percent of the same data collection, even if they serve up
[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:50.420]  a lot of it, they're not going to have the same granular level of detail that you would
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:53.700]  get within the Netflix app. So why would Netflix ever agree to that?
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:59.460]  Right. Yeah. And, and just being, and, and giving up the control over being able to get
[01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:04.100]  the data that they want, you know, like, you know, if they want to know how much, how many
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:07.940]  times people pause a show, you know, they could do it because they add, it's their own
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:11.500]  app. The only way to watch it is in their own app. And if that's interesting to them,
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:16.900]  you know, you know, if they want to say, if they want to do an algorithm and say, Hey,
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:21.380]  these comedy specials that people tend not to pause, do better than the ones that people
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:25.160]  pause a couple of times, you know, this guy or this woman, you know, at a comedy special
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:29.300]  that, and people, I don't know if that's useful or not. I'm just saying that if they want
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:32.980]  to study that, totally, but that they've got data nerds looking at that, right. It's exactly
[01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:36.820]  like the whole, the whole money ball aspect of baseball. If you want to figure out if
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:41.860]  a guy who's left handed, you know, tends to hit the ball in between shortstop and third
[01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:46.740]  base, and that's worth an extra, you know, two wins a season, you can do it if you have
[01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:52.020]  the data, right. But you've got to have the data, you just have to have it for sure. And
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:57.260]  this is, you know, it gets into it where it's not just having the control and wanting them
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:01.420]  in your app. So you have the control. You're also fighting Apple's institutional stance
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:09.480]  on privacy where Apple can say, Hey, you should you, you know, Mr. Hulu executive should let
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:13.800]  us have your shows, put your shows right here in the TV app without making people jump out.
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:19.460]  It's great. It's all private for the user. That's not a selling point. It's a selling
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:24.360]  point to the user. It sounds, you know, from Apple's perspective, it seems like a selling
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:29.000]  point that everybody should get on board with. But from the perspective of somebody who is
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:35.340]  at a data hungry company, that is not a selling point. That is totally selling point.
[01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:39.460]  And I mean, that speaks to what I think, you know, what happened with Apple news plus to
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:42.820]  write, like, why is the New York Times and everyone like everyone was was focused on
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:46.600]  this 50% cut, which is obviously ridiculous, but it's also it just, they weren't going
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:50.940]  to share the subscriber data. So like, why on earth would they ever, you know, you you're
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:56.860]  basically giving up the goose if you're doing that for as these these content companies.
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:12:01.340]  So I think they would be foolish to do that. And it's just to a much greater degree with
[01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:06.080]  the with the Netflixes of the worlds because they are so data focused, even though it may
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:08.620]  not seem like that on the surface of it.
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:14.960]  I think the bad news is we're stuck bouncing between apps. Yes, and they can make it as
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:19.980]  try to make it as seamless as possible. But I don't see any way around it.
[01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:24.020]  Yeah, the old and I mean, the only way and this sort of speaks to their their original
[01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:29.300]  content, right? Like, another part of the reason why why you would do it is if you needed
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:35.920]  leverage over, obviously, again, going back to the notion that that EdiQ and whatnot have
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:39.700]  been having these conversations for a better part of a decade at this point, and haven't
[01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:44.160]  really been able to break through with with the Hollywood executives on the on the content
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:48.720]  side of things. And so it's a lot easier to have sort of those types of conversations.
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:54.880]  If you're also a content creator who has must have content, and you have more importantly,
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:59.820]  the user base that these content creators need to access. And so I think Apple's probably
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:05.700]  now holding out hope that there's some combination of, of everything that they're doing the culmination
[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:10.540]  of all these things that launches in the fall. And after it, like sort of a two year span
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:15.420]  of doing this and being successful at it, that they're able to get some degree of leverage
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:20.220]  again over having different types of conversations, but I just don't think Netflix is ever going
[01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:23.940]  to, to be in play for that.
[01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:30.260]  I still think it is fascinating. If you really just pause and think about what does Apple
[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:34.820]  do? What is Apple always done is they sell devices, they sell computers, and that's where
[01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:41.140]  they make money. So they've always made money. And, you know, they've they've had famously
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:46.500]  they made, they made iTunes for Windows, but the only reason they made iTunes for Windows
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:52.580]  was to allow Windows users to use iPods. So they were still selling a device. It was all,
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:57.580]  you know, whatever that are, you know, that's a famous Steve Jobs story that Steve Jobs
[01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:03.660]  was opposed to it. And Phil Schiller and a few others were adamant about it. And he eventually,
[01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:07.340]  I think I think it's an Isaacson story, too. He was like, all right, whatever, just go
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:12.740]  ahead. Don't tell just don't talk to me about it. Right. You know, but it wound up turning
[01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:20.940]  the iPod from a nice little Mac peripheral into a piece of pop culture, you know, something
[01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:25.060]  that everybody knew, you know, literally, I remember at the time, you'd be walking in
[01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:31.060]  the mall, and I'd hear kids say, I want to go to the iPod store. Yep. But it's, you know,
[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:36.340]  still backed by hardware. And, you know, they've got Apple music for Android. I'd love to know
[01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:41.860]  how well that's doing. Yeah, really would. Yeah, you never hear about it. Don't, but
[01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:47.580]  I've got it on my pixel. It looks pretty good. It certainly looks more like an Android app
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:53.700]  than Google's apps look like iOS apps, to be honest. And so it's as opposed to iTunes,
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:57.480]  which never really looked like a native Windows app. That makes sense, right? Because they
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:01.860]  have the deals with the music labels, and they want to be able to compete with Spotify.
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:05.780]  And they you know, there's there by some accounts, I think, ahead in the US, but still pretty
[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:10.260]  far behind worldwide, right? And and Android's obviously key for worldwide distribution and
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:16.340]  all that stuff, right? It doesn't seem like Apple music for Android ever needed, they
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:21.320]  never needed to be concerned that this is going to affect iPhone sales. Yes. Whereas
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:27.260]  with TV, what they're doing now by partnering to get this stuff baked right into these quote
[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:38.340]  unquote smart TVs is definitely deflating the appeal of owning an Apple TV puck. Yeah.
[01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:43.460]  That's fascinating. I agree 100%. And I think we've probably even talked about this before.
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:49.440]  I know, like, I have long talked about this. The Apple TV device is fascinating to me,
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:55.460]  because it feels like the ultimate device in that Apple keeps being just a bit off of
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:16:02.760]  where they should be with it. Where, you know, obviously, the I think it's sold pretty well,
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:06.460]  it's not sort of selling as well as Roku and some of the other cheaper, cheaper sticks
[01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:10.420]  and things like that. But it's been around for a long time now and a bunch of different
[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:13.700]  iterations. And it seems like they've always been just on the cusp of doing something really
[01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:19.460]  interesting with it. Most recent versions of it were more interesting because of the
[01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:24.540]  fact that it's obviously fully running, you know, their own variation of iOS now, and
[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:30.420]  it has the a system chips in it. And so it can be an iOS device and it can run software
[01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:34.780]  just like an iOS device was and in namely, it can run and this speaks to another part
[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:40.100]  of the services package games, but they haven't done games in a way that's at all compelling
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:43.840]  on the Apple TV, even though they have them they have the App Store part and I think the
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:49.420]  biggest inhibiting factor right now, the games Yeah, they're not the hardcore games of, you
[01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:53.140]  know, Xbox or PlayStation. That's not to say that they couldn't be though, necessarily
[01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:57.500]  given the power of these chips these days. But the biggest factor is the controls, right
[01:16:57.500 --> 01:17:00.720]  that they don't have their own control. I know they offer third party ones in stores
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:04.660]  or whatever. Apple needs to make their own controller. And this can I mean, we can go
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:09.100]  off on a tangent on this. I would argue that that's why beyond the obvious the most the
[01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:13.380]  crown jewel of buying the IP of Nintendo, Nintendo makes great controllers to imagine
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:18.040]  buying Nintendo to get access to their their hardware IP around controllers like and launching
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:19.040]  something that way.
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:24.540]  I think that the steel case controller is like 60 bucks to if and is it Have you ever
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:29.980]  used it? Yeah, good. I have one I bought one feels a lot like an Xbox controller, which
[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:37.660]  is my least favorite. And I say this as somebody who retired from active video game playing
[01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:43.780]  a while back. I spent a lot of time playing the Wii when Jonas was younger. So the Wii
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:49.100]  the original Wii was the last video game system that I spent the what I would consider a lot
[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:54.660]  of time playing and I never really loved the Wii controls. I thought they were clever with
[01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:58.060]  the pointing and the waving and stuff like that. But like when I played Mario Kart, I
[01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:03.420]  didn't wave, you know, tilt the thing. Right. But I'd never liked the Xbox controller. It's
[01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:09.300]  it's okay. It feels the Steelcase one for Apple TV feels like a generic controller.
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:14.860]  Like if you were making a controller for a TV show and you in and the lawyers came and
[01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:20.420]  said, Don't show a PlayStation controller don't show Xbox. And they're like, just make
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:25.420]  like just have the ID team make up like just a generic video game controller. That's exactly
[01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:30.020]  what it feels like. It's okay. But it just feels like a kick in the pants that you're
[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:37.660]  buying this box that's so much more expensive than a Roku or a fire thing from Amazon. And
[01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:42.260]  if you want to play games, you've got to spend 60 bucks on a controller. And that's one controller
[01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:45.960]  that your statement reminds me of when I was a kid and I used to go over to a friend's
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:52.760]  house who had the Nintendo 64 and one of the controllers and that that Council, Council
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:57.120]  famously had four control ports. But we for some reason, we always had one that was a
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:01.540]  generic one not paid by do. And whoever had to use that one was sort of, you know, the
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:05.860]  runt of the litter. Right, right. And it's like, Oh, God, fine. I'll use this one. But
[01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:10.460]  yeah, I can see how that that feels like that with the sort of controllers, because Apple
[01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:15.600]  doesn't make them first party and really should. And I think that that's, to me, like the gaming
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:20.340]  service that they announced is very interesting. I think that it's super compelling. I could
[01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:25.380]  see why it's compelling to game creators were in this world of iOS games have been in the
[01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:30.340]  race to the bottom, you know, they have to be 99 cents, or do in app purchase, or they're
[01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:36.060]  basically done for. And so this is a way to sort of battle back against that. But I still
[01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:41.480]  feel like a huge component of this should be at least leveraging that box that you have
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:45.980]  in your living room, which is the Apple TV. And the only way that they do that, I think
[01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:50.620]  is with a really great controller. Yeah, I think it's more powerful as a computer than
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:55.020]  the Wii, not the Wii, the Switch, which we have, I think for sure it is. I don't even
[01:19:55.020 --> 01:20:00.040]  think it's close. I know there's rumors that seem pretty good that that Nintendo is going
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:05.100]  to come out with like a switch to which is like, just new hardware, like not a new platform.
[01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:09.820]  So all the games will work, but it's just going to be like a faster Tegra CPU, because
[01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:14.340]  the one they have in there is a little underpowered. And it's, you know, and way that people love
[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:18.460]  their switch, and that switch games are super fun to play, and they all look great, and
[01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:22.860]  they don't feel slow. And you know, it's, they're definitely in that same boat with
[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:27.400]  the switch. And Nintendo's success with it is showing that you don't have to compete
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:34.040]  with PlayStation and Xbox in that the way that they are really competing against gaming
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:38.060]  PCs, you don't have to get into that whole area. Yep. And so right. So that and that
[01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:44.460]  seems like the avenue that Apple is sort of likely to take, I assume that it's more, not
[01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:52.100]  casual, but just sort of different than than yeah, the hardcore PC games. And I think that
[01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:56.420]  that's a smart approach. We'll see what the price point ends up being. You mentioned $10.
[01:20:56.420 --> 01:21:00.380]  I wouldn't be shocked if they do it a little bit more than that, like 15 or something.
[01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:03.620]  It sort of depends on you know, what what they have in store when they when they launch
[01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:09.420]  with with whatever they're going to launch. Yeah, that's a big one to put the way that
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:13.300]  they're not allowing any in that, you know, anybody who's competing in that in that anybody
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:19.220]  who's got a game in Apple Arcade. Yeah, that's it. You're no game. Yeah, no in app purchase.
[01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:23.300]  I think that's great. I think it's gonna work with Nintendo, right? It was so well, it was
[01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:28.420]  sort of a weird thing that into the Super Mario Run thing was weird in my in my mind,
[01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:31.900]  like, I get what they were trying to do with it, right? You could get it for free, and
[01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:36.300]  then you paid one time fee, and then you unlocked it and there was no more in app. I think they
[01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:40.580]  didn't do as well as they were probably expecting to do with that. And now Nintendo's success
[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:46.180]  stories and mobile have been just in app purchase, right? It's like that the Fire Emblem thing
[01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:50.700]  and Animal Crossing. I always liked the notion of what Apple and Nintendo were trying to
[01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:55.420]  do with that, right? Not trick anyone not not allow kids to, to have to spend an arm
[01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:59.420]  and a leg and just be constantly milked for more and more, more of their milk money out
[01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:06.980]  of it. Right? Yeah, I totally appreciate that. And it's, you know, it's the right thing to
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:10.980]  do, even if they are leaving money on the table. I don't know the slot game. The slot
[01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:17.900]  machine of vacation of video games on mobile is it. Maybe it's beneath the whole privacy
[01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:24.540]  stuff with Facebook. And you know, it's not like the Facebook stuff is like getting Donald
[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:30.860]  Trump and Brexit elections. It's changing the course of 21st century world history.
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:37.340]  The people spending 20 bucks a month on Candy Crush isn't but, you know, so it's low down
[01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:41.700]  on a list of our industry problems, but it is a problem. It's not right. And it also
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:45.820]  sort of started with Facebook as well, right? Right. Farmville and all those things back
[01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:50.580]  in the day. Like that's how people originally that's where the whales came from. And then
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:55.900]  they moved on to mobile. But yeah, this was, this all ties back to Facebook in the end,
[01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:57.420]  unfortunately.
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:00.260]  Did you see that thing a couple months ago where there was a lawsuit about their games
[01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:04.840]  and that they had as part of the discovery they had like chat transcripts from Facebook
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:09.260]  employees who were talking about like, hey, there's a there's a
[01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:11.740]  Oh, the whale. This was about the whale thing, right?
[01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:19.660]  Yeah, somebody's, what's it called when you you blank a charge you're, you're right. What's
[01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:27.420]  the word? dispute? Yeah, there's a there's a dispute of a charge. It's a it's a 15 year
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:33.620]  old girl who racked up $4,000 stuff. And it's like, well, is she really 15 or 14? And it's
[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:37.020]  like, I don't know, she doesn't really look it. So they're even saying like, it doesn't
[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:42.340]  really look like she's 15. It's just that, you know, that's the minimum age had to be.
[01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:46.860]  And you know, and they have all this proof that Facebook knew that kids didn't realize
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:50.740]  they were playing with real money, that they really thought that it was a virtual currency,
[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:54.900]  which of course isn't it actually does is not that hard to believe with all these games
[01:23:54.900 --> 01:24:01.140]  that have for sure. They have coins and yeah, and literally like $4,000. Like, like, not
[01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:06.980]  like, oh, your kid ran up 40 bucks, like $4,000. And they're just like, ah, let it go. No,
[01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:13.340]  no, don't, don't do a chargeback on that one. It's like that you're a bad person. That's,
[01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:19.140]  that's bad. Anyway, and, and yeah, and Apple. I mean, that was a big, that was the subtext.
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:22.500]  I think Benedict Evans wrote about this, too, which I agree with, like the subjects of this
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:28.980]  whole event was not only the services thing, but it's also privacy and, and sort of doing
[01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:32.500]  the right thing with things like this, right, even to the point where that one of the more
[01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:36.420]  surprising things, which I thought was fascinating was that they kept talking up in every single
[01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:41.220]  instance how they were, there was family sharing and all of these services, right? Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:45.740]  So yeah, once and everyone can access it in your family. Yeah. And you know, it wasn't
[01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:50.100]  you don't, you didn't have to even really be paying attention to the event to see that
[01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:54.380]  they were putting up the same slide with the same seven bullet points, you know, family
[01:24:54.380 --> 01:25:01.660]  sharing and private and kid friendly and, you know, whatever the list of seven things
[01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:06.300]  were, it was the same for news, it was the same for games, it was the same for TV, etc,
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:10.380]  I mean, it's, it's obviously something they're hammering home that they believe in, I really
[01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:15.740]  do think they believe in it. And I also think that they think that this is, this is appealing.
[01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:22.540]  Yep. To quickly tie back to your point about, so, Apple TV, the device, because they're
[01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:27.400]  releasing the service on all these other TVs, and they're really undercutting their argument
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:32.640]  for Apple TV, it feels like they obviously have to know that. And so what is their plan
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:37.820]  going forward? Do they do something where it's more like, full fledged, more full fledged
[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:43.660]  gaming service with a controller and something to upsell? Do they do they package Apple TVs
[01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:49.140]  Plus, like we were talking about, to try to sell, you know, sort of the more hardcore
[01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:53.980]  Apple users? Do they do something entirely different? Like, I think, you know, you and
[01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:57.580]  I've talked about in the past, like, they really dropped the ball with the opportunity
[01:25:57.580 --> 01:26:02.900]  to use this device that people had in their homes, either as a precursor to Alexa or as
[01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:08.980]  a Euro type thing, right, where they could have just had this hardware and used it for
[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:13.140]  all these other things that we'd now use hardware for. And they had this thing right there for
[01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:16.780]  the taking and just didn't do anything that interesting with it. So do they do that now
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:23.700]  and make it a more interesting box because they really need to make a key value sell
[01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:27.660]  on buying a $200 box when you don't need it anymore for anything?
[01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:32.780]  Yeah, I totally agree. And I don't know, I think it's a tragedy. I've talked to and in
[01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:37.100]  fact, I don't know anybody privately who even argues otherwise. I mean, somebody at Apple
[01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:43.100]  must think it's a bad idea to be in the router Wi Fi business. But I know so many people,
[01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:47.860]  friends who are former Apple employees, just outside observers, everybody thinks it is
[01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:56.020]  just like a heartbreaking mistake that Apple has abandoned the airport business because
[01:26:56.020 --> 01:27:01.620]  this whole that they're that they've gotten out of the business right as online privacy
[01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:07.380]  has become something you want to talk about a privacy argument. Make that argument. Yes.
[01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:13.920]  It's foremost on their their public statements that Tim Cook talks about privacy every single
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:19.900]  time he's in public, every interview, everything. I mean, he obviously means it, it is obviously
[01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:26.980]  strategically central to Apple right now. And and going forward, it's hard to see how
[01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:32.700]  that's going to change. It's not. And they've, you know, to have this ally, if you are as
[01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:38.680]  a consumer, concerned about your privacy and your online privacy to be able to buy a router
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:44.540]  that you can trust. And that isn't going to, if it does listen to voice commands that you
[01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:51.620]  really do believe that they're not that they don't have like an army of employees who listen.
[01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:55.340]  And when somebody says something funny, they pass it around, which is a story I think the
[01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:59.960]  information or somebody broke about Amazon, you know, that they've got this army of humans
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:03.260]  who are backing up these commands to figure out, you know, when something goes wrong to
[01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:07.260]  listen to it, and then figure out how to correct it. And they're sharing this stuff and that
[01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:13.180]  they have access to your home address and just crazy stuff. Like, if you could, I would
[01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:18.820]  really trust Apple in that regard. And to have them not be making a router of all the
[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:22.820]  products that could really, really affect the privacy of every single device on your
[01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:28.380]  network. That's it's just central to it. And then it's heartbreaking. And yeah, they could
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:32.900]  tie it together and say, just buy this one thing. It's not that big. And you can put
[01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:38.020]  it in your living room. And it also play games and shows showed TV shows and original content
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:42.260]  and stuff. Yep. And has Siri baked in and has all this, you know, all this other stuff
[01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:45.900]  that they could do with it, and they just weren't able to pull it all together for some
[01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:53.700]  reason. To have the foresight to be able to do that. And, but, but I think that that stuff
[01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:57.380]  is still in play, maybe not the router stuff, you know, given what you're talking about.
[01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:01.740]  But some of that other some of those other elements with the sort of, you know, I think
[01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:06.900]  everyone agrees that that HomePod has not been a success. And so, you know, the rumors
[01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:09.540]  are that they're working on a smaller version or something, but like, why not just bake
[01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:14.340]  it into this device, right? Like, and then make make a reason for people to have this
[01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:18.560]  device again, or at least some, some sort of compelling argument when, you know, why
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:23.060]  you would buy this when you are about to launch your service, which is the focal point of
[01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:27.260]  this on all these other devices. Yeah, I don't know what the router thing I just wanted to
[01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:31.020]  know, I want to know, like, what are we supposed to buy? You know, I mean, I have, I mean,
[01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:33.700]  they're not sponsoring this week's show. I have a row. I've had it for years. I like
[01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:40.140]  it. You know, so I you know, that way, if somebody asked me what I should buy, I would
[01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:43.780]  honestly again, they're not sponsoring this week's show, but they have sponsored many
[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:47.660]  times. So take it with a grain of salt, if you wish, or a disclaimer, but my honest advice
[01:29:47.660 --> 01:29:51.340]  to like a family member who said, Hey, I need I want to get a new Wi Fi thing. I would tell
[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:57.260]  them to get a row. But like, what does Tim Cook have at his house? Yeah, right. You know,
[01:29:57.260 --> 01:30:02.780]  what does Phil Schiller have? I mean, do they just pay to have like, professionals and so
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:08.300]  yeah, the enterprise grade stuff? I mean, likely, maybe, maybe not. I mean, do they
[01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:11.980]  have that in what do they have? Yeah, in there? What do they recommend their family members?
[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:17.460]  Right, right. Right. I don't know, it was just it's just a bizarre product to get out.
[01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:23.700]  I see how it might have been a tough business, because it's just like, the problem that TiVo
[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:28.580]  always had, where they're trying to get you to buy this DVR, but the cable company gives
[01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:32.780]  you a DVR. Steve Jobs talked about this at length in the book about the problems getting
[01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:37.660]  into TV is that the problem is they're competing against anything you want to sell people is
[01:30:37.660 --> 01:30:42.340]  competing against a box they get from the cable company for quote, unquote, free. Yep.
[01:30:42.340 --> 01:30:47.180]  You know, I mean, the modern opportunity is that, you know, as opposed to 15 years ago,
[01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:52.000]  the modern opportunity is that there's a growing number of people who don't have the box from
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:56.500]  cable company, they only have internet service. So there's your opportunity. But on the router
[01:30:56.500 --> 01:31:00.520]  front, everybody gets you still have to have internet you can't, you know, that's the cord
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:05.180]  you can't cut. Yes. So that's a good point. And yeah, I totally agree. Like the that's
[01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:08.260]  what when we were talking about the Steve Jobs, I finally cracked the thing, it sort
[01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:13.420]  of seems like this day and age would be a lot easier to sort of start from scratch because
[01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:17.400]  the cable box is not so ingrained, but it took just time for that to happen. Right.
[01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:21.380]  And you're right with the router thing, too. But I feel like just what you were talking
[01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:25.980]  about earlier, the argument now is the privacy argument. And that's a that's a super compelling
[01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:30.660]  argument to a lot of people, right? And you just say, like, Apple got out of that business,
[01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:34.460]  for probably the right reasons from a bottom line perspective, and from their own perspective
[01:31:34.460 --> 01:31:38.500]  and focus and whatnot. But now you can make the argument that that would have been their
[01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:43.580]  their single greatest sort of strength with regard to the privacy and security argument.
[01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:48.140]  And so even if they're not making a ton of money off of these devices, now that we have
[01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:53.300]  services narrative, like what would be better than having some sort of security like Euro
[01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:57.860]  offers like security services right through their box? And so why would Apple not do that?
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:02.140]  They of course would and they probably wish that they could do that now. But they pulled
[01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:05.940]  back. Yeah, who knows what they're going to do now that they're an Amazon subsidiary,
[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:10.900]  but their last year or so their heroes if you know, just listening to what they tell
[01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:18.260]  me to promote on the on the podcast reads their, their add on Euro plus service was
[01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:24.580]  clearly a central the big idea that they had, you know, by I don't know if they were selling
[01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:28.980]  the hardware breakeven or whatever, but the hardware is fair enough price that I wouldn't
[01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:34.340]  be surprised that to make money. It was the service, you know, yep, yep, services services
[01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:35.340]  services.
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:41.060]  So, I don't know what else you you wanted to talk about. But that that sort of I think
[01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:45.300]  is an interesting segue into a question I had for you. Okay, I love questions for me.
[01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:50.940]  So one thing, you know, now that I'm so far removed from my reporting days, you know,
[01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:54.540]  going on, I don't even know how long it's been eight years or something since I've been
[01:32:54.540 --> 01:32:58.740]  a day to day reporter. And obviously, I was covering Apple a lot back in those days. But
[01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:04.220]  I came into Apple in a very different vector than you did, where, you know, you've been
[01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:07.100]  sort of, you know, following the company, obviously, since since you started writing
[01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:11.820]  on the internet, but, you know, before that, as a, as just a fan and the user, and I came
[01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:17.020]  in in a very different sort of position where you speak to the iPod, the iPod was the thing
[01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:20.940]  that hooked me into it when I was still a Windows user, right. And that's how the whole
[01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:25.740]  Halo effect thing and then I started buying Apple products after I bought that initial
[01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:30.500]  iPod. But I was like a hardcore Windows user went to the midnight launch of Windows 95,
[01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:36.100]  you and things like that. And so I came into it much later, but then I felt like the timing
[01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:39.620]  ended up being good from my reporting days of like, figuring out that this is like the
[01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:43.380]  company that's really, you know, was the underdog, but seems like it's going to come
[01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:46.100]  roaring back. And of course, that happened and became the most valuable company in the
[01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:50.500]  world, yada yada. So these days, when I'm looking at the company, again, from afar,
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:55.700]  and I've been out of the day to day for a long time now, but I do see a company that,
[01:33:55.700 --> 01:34:01.020]  you know, is unquestionably slipping at the edges. But I do wonder what your perspective
[01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:05.260]  is, as someone who watches it more closely on a day to day, and I obviously get a sense
[01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:09.900]  of it reading, you know, during Fireball, but what do you think? Do you think that there's
[01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:15.100]  a risk that this sort of slipping at the edges with things like the MacBook keyboard, you
[01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:18.740]  know, on down HomePod, all these other sort of little things that are just sort of slight
[01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:24.100]  misses to pretty big misses? Do you think that it becomes this thing that leads to an
[01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:28.180]  internal sort of rot, for lack of a better word within the company?
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:32.940]  That's a very good question. I worry about that a lot. I think that's that the stability
[01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:38.700]  at the executive level, which is really pretty extraordinary, helps. I mean, Tim Cook's been
[01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:42.740]  there for a while. Phil Schiller has been there the longest of anybody. I think Schiller
[01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:47.940]  was the only one who's I believe, who's still left on the executive page who was there before
[01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:54.060]  the next as I call it the next reunification. Eddie Q, lifer, and Johnny Ive, of course,
[01:34:54.060 --> 01:34:56.860]  and Johnny was, of course there. Yeah, well, I don't know what I'm talking about. There's
[01:34:56.860 --> 01:35:01.900]  a couple, but that actually, but the fact that there are these top people like Eddie
[01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:06.500]  and Phil and Johnny, who've been there since before Steve Jobs came back to the company
[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:13.700]  and are still there helps in some ways at maintaining, you know, Apple is Apple. But
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:23.340]  I do think that I think it's too easy to lose your edge when you're on top. It's being the
[01:35:23.340 --> 01:35:30.300]  scrappy underdog kept them, I think kept the whole company down to the smallest details
[01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:38.460]  on edge because they couldn't afford, you know, I don't want to exaggerate too much.
[01:35:38.460 --> 01:35:45.900]  But I think that if they'd had this keyboard problem, circa 2005, 2006, it would have been
[01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:52.700]  a much bigger problem that they couldn't afford to have unreliable keyboard. Yes, yeah, for
[01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:56.860]  sure. Because people would just go right back to Windows, right? Right. Yeah, you know,
[01:35:56.860 --> 01:36:00.800]  and now they feel like they've got them, I feel and I feel like they might underestimate
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:05.740]  like I don't want to focus too much on the Mac, because your question was about Apple
[01:36:05.740 --> 01:36:13.640]  as a whole. But the Mac is in a precarious place, in my opinion, because I think an awful
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:19.160]  lot of the growth, if not the majority of the growth in Mac users in the last 10 years
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:24.460]  aren't really Mac users, in my sense of the word where they're not deeply entrenched in
[01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:31.980]  the Mac ecosystem. There's just to name one type of user would be like a web developer,
[01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:40.300]  who mostly uses Safari or Chrome, right off in Chrome, and the terminal window. Yep, yep.
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:46.340]  And you know, I forget the name of the text editor, which is a cross platform text editor,
[01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:51.780]  I forget if it's called Sublime Text or whatever, but it's cross platform, it's not deeply integrated
[01:36:51.780 --> 01:36:57.660]  with a Mac in any way, like the way the edit is, or the way Xcode is, if you're that person
[01:36:57.660 --> 01:37:05.020]  can easily switch to another computer. I think there's a lot of casual users who mostly use
[01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:11.760]  stuff in Safari. You know, Safari Mail, I mean, messages is a big one. But if they do
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:15.300]  their messages, if they still have an iPhone, they can switch. I don't know how many people
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:20.060]  who use, you know, iMessage also, you know, count on being able to do it from their Mac.
[01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:24.140]  But there's an awful lot of Mac users who've grown, you know, come into the fold in the
[01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:30.180]  last 10 years, who would have a fairly easy time switching to another anything with the
[01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:35.060]  web browser. And, you know, a couple of these generic things, as opposed to like me, I would
[01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:40.900]  be lost, I would be lost not using the Mac, because I use it in ways that are specific
[01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:45.900]  and only and unique to the Macintosh. So this keyboard thing, I hear it from people, I hear
[01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:50.260]  people who say, Well, I, you know, yeah, I had to suck, I got a second one, it went bad.
[01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:56.900]  So I got rid of it. And I switched to ThinkPad or something. You know, just like that. That's
[01:37:56.900 --> 01:38:01.540]  would be very, very difficult for me. You know, I don't think we're seeing it yet. Mac
[01:38:01.540 --> 01:38:07.820]  sales in their quarterly statements, but really, the reputational harm is there. I do I don't
[01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:13.860]  know, I is it rot? Is it arrogance? I think some of it might be a little arrogant. I mean,
[01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:20.940]  the keyboard thing is pretty exemplary of it. I think it's really I don't, I've written
[01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:25.260]  a fair amount about it, you know, recently, and I've had said some pretty strong things
[01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:30.020]  like it's off quoted that I said, it's the biggest mistake in Apple's history. And I
[01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:36.780]  put an asterisk, an hour or two later to say modern history. Well, I don't think well,
[01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:40.300]  people were it was a fun Twitter discussion. People were tossing stuff like that out. Mobile
[01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:45.140]  Me was not a good launch. Right. But it gave way to iCloud. Yeah, everything that sort
[01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:49.020]  of Well, they fixed it. You know, as soon as it launched, Steve Jobs famously held a
[01:38:49.020 --> 01:38:53.020]  town hall meeting, right? He said, Hey, what somebody tell me what is mobile me supposed
[01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:57.660]  to do? And then somebody some brave soul raised their hand and said, it's supposed to do x,
[01:38:57.660 --> 01:39:04.500]  y and z. And he said, Yes, that's a good description. So why the hell doesn't it do that? Silence,
[01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:09.820]  you know, fix it. Yeah, get it. But the other thing is that mobile me being crummy didn't
[01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:14.080]  do reputational harm to Apple because their reputation was already a company that is not
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:17.980]  good at online service. Yep. Yep. And the same thing with paying and right, like all
[01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:22.340]  of those things. Yeah, totally. And this is this hits at their fundamental like goes back
[01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:27.660]  to the earliest days the company like creating hardware, differentiated hardware mixed with
[01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:33.020]  software and they have messed up the hardware component to the point where Yeah, I mean,
[01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:40.420]  the Wall Street Journal is writing giant stories about it. So I, again, I love the Mac at a
[01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:44.740]  deep level. And I know a lot of people do I think the Mac still has lots of diehard
[01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:50.100]  Mac users who know tricks and really and use lots of third party apps and stuff like that
[01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:56.420]  the traditional Mac user the type of Mac user who back in the day would read Mac user magazine,
[01:39:56.420 --> 01:40:01.700]  get a magazine just to just to read about what's new and stuff like that enthusiasts.
[01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:05.620]  But even for it's not a bad thing. I just think it's dangerous for Apple because the
[01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:10.420]  other type of user the casual user who just uses it at a very thin veneer level, right
[01:40:10.420 --> 01:40:14.260]  and easily switch. And the reason but why did they use a Mac even though Macs are quote
[01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:17.500]  unquote expensive because they had a reputation as being the best even if you didn't really
[01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:22.000]  care about the software that much. You just wanted a web browser. If you really buy laptops
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.340]  based on the hardware, which is different than me. To me, it's the ecosystem. I'd rather
[01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:32.860]  have a bad laptop running Mac OS 10 than a perfect hardware laptop running windows. I
[01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:36.620]  would because that's just that's what I need to do for my work. But I I'm not saying the
[01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:42.840]  other people are crazy. I think you know, they have a point. Yeah, it's Apple's reputation
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:45.700]  was it was the best it was the best laptop you could buy.
[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:49.700]  So that's fascinating because obviously it was the web browser that sort of a lot also
[01:40:49.700 --> 01:40:55.500]  allowed Apple to take off right because all of a sudden it didn't the software didn't
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:59.140]  matter as much as long as you had access to the web browser. And so if that's if that
[01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:03.780]  was both the entry point and now it's also the exit point, of course, potentially for
[01:41:03.780 --> 01:41:06.660]  for these casual users that you're talking about, you know, like anecdotally, you see
[01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:13.300]  a lot more surface tablets out and about right. Because because it seems like a well designed
[01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:18.940]  machine. Yes, it runs Windows, but most people are just using it for the web browser.
[01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:23.740]  No it's very true. I definitely see more surfaces out there. Microsoft is quietly they've kind
[01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:28.180]  of created their own Mac, in a sense, right? Yeah, it's like where the Mac was back in
[01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:32.060]  the day, like, you know, there's not a lot of them, you don't see, you're not going to
[01:41:32.060 --> 01:41:38.500]  see that picture of the college classroom where right with all the illuminated 500 students
[01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:43.380]  have Windows logo on their laptop. But you go into a coffee shop, and you're going to
[01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:48.980]  see a couple of them. So let me ask you an offshoot of that, which is that of what you're
[01:41:48.980 --> 01:41:54.500]  just talking about? Do you think because my sense is, I think one way to easily explain
[01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:58.380]  what is happening is that sort of what you what you're suggesting, where they're at the
[01:41:58.380 --> 01:42:04.280]  point of success now, and it's like, are they focusing on the right stuff? It also feels
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:10.260]  like those, the hardware got to a point where it was so good, that it almost felt like they
[01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:14.860]  started tinkering in a way that was over engineering. And I think that the keyboards are a great
[01:42:14.860 --> 01:42:20.980]  example of that they created an entirely new, you know, the famous butterfly mechanism to
[01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:26.140]  be to be able to create a new style of keyboard that they, they at the time, you know, I remember
[01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:30.600]  there was a there was a johnny i video about it, right about how the push down was more
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:34.740]  evenly distributed across the key, right, right. And so it was many push at the corner
[01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:38.580]  of the key, the whole key was right, the whole key goes down. And so and that, of course,
[01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:43.780]  they did a great job with that with the track pads, right. And so it seems like that they,
[01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:49.220]  they actually over engineered the product, where they thought they were obviously doing
[01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:53.820]  it for reasons to make it more reliable, the exact opposite ended up happening. And I feel
[01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:57.380]  like you can see this in more and more of the products. And I think the touch bar is
[01:42:57.380 --> 01:43:02.780]  an ultimate example of this too, right? Like, that is, it's like a thing that the the the
[01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:06.900]  Jeff Goldblum Jurassic Park quote, right, where it's like, they became so preoccupied
[01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:11.260]  with with whether or not they could they didn't stop to think if they should type situation.
[01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:15.700]  Yeah, and there's a couple of other aspects that tie into that, too, that I find a little
[01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:21.380]  worrisome. So like, I don't think I'm alone here. I feel like there's two types of people
[01:43:21.380 --> 01:43:26.500]  with the arrow key layout. There's the people like me who really miss the upside down t.
[01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:30.180]  And then there's people who maybe don't care. I don't think there's anybody who thinks that
[01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:35.180]  the new layout where the left and right keys are full height keys is a better design for
[01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:41.620]  those arrow keys. Why would they change that? Well, I think it's very obvious. And to me,
[01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:47.780]  it's a little worrisome. I do think that the new layout looks better, because the keyboard
[01:43:47.780 --> 01:43:53.140]  looks better aesthetically without those gaps above just two of the keys. And instead, it's
[01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:59.360]  a perfect rectangle. Yeah, but it doesn't work better. And that's in direct contradiction
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:03.900]  to the famous Steve Jobs quote that design, most people think it's just what it looks
[01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:09.260]  like design is how it works. Well, that the new arrow key layout does not work better.
[01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:14.980]  If you use arrow keys a lot, and I do while text editing, I use them all the time. It's
[01:44:14.980 --> 01:44:18.740]  it's not better. It's worse. It's no doubt it's worse. It just looks better. And I find
[01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:23.680]  that very worrisome that there is a and again, I'm not blaming johnny. I've personally maybe
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:27.720]  he had nothing to do with it. Maybe he did. Maybe he's the one who insisted I don't know.
[01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:33.640]  But somewhere in his group is somebody who felt strongly enough about how the keyboard
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:38.720]  looks with full height left and right keys, and won the argument, you know, and I think
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:43.900]  the other key just go to the other corner of the keyboard. And the lack of a hardware
[01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:50.800]  escape key. Again, I'm sure most users never touch the escape key. But the users who do
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:55.880]  use the escape key, like developers who use code editors that have the escape key caught,
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:45:02.860]  you know, map to code completion or something like that. Use it all the time, and not having
[01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:07.360]  a hardware escape key on the touch bar keyboards is driving those people nuts. It's not better.
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:11.160]  It is definitely not better. It is worse. And would that would the touch bar look a
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:17.860]  little worse with an escape a real escape key up there, and only have it replaced the
[01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:22.600]  f1 through f whatever's it I guess it would look a little less clever, but it would work
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:27.200]  better. That's it's all very worrisome. And that is completely aside from the fact that
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:34.320]  these keyboards have a tendency to break. So that leads to the, I think what is sort
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:38.420]  of the ultimate question right now, at least in my head, and so it's not like a unique
[01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:41.700]  idea to me, of course, but like, I do think that this is something I keep coming back
[01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:45.660]  to when I'm thinking about these, like, sort of higher level discussions. So you mentioned,
[01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:50.120]  and it's perfect in that you mentioned, you know, like, Phil Schiller, Johnny Ive, Eddie
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:55.080]  Q, Tim Cook, all of these people have their roles at Apple, and have had them for 20 years,
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:59.780]  in some case, 25 years, in some cases, right. And even Tim Cook's like, while he's now CEO,
[01:45:59.780 --> 01:46:04.360]  and has been for a long time at this point, he's still an logistics guy and an operations
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:09.980]  guy, right at his at his core. So they don't have, it seems they obviously do have people,
[01:46:09.980 --> 01:46:14.140]  but they don't have the one product person. They have Johnny Ive, who's designed they
[01:46:14.140 --> 01:46:18.240]  have Phil Schiller, who does marketing, and a lot of them and I know he tries to sort
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:23.980]  of bridge into the product decisions in some cases, right. And I think many of them do,
[01:46:23.980 --> 01:46:28.460]  but they don't have that one sort of head of product person that I'm aware of, at least
[01:46:28.460 --> 01:46:34.660]  who sort of makes those ultimate calls, which you think could alleviate it the very least
[01:46:34.660 --> 01:46:39.100]  some of these these questions and have they had that person since Steve Jobs has been
[01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:42.340]  gone? And so is it as simple as that?
[01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:48.460]  Maybe, you know, like, I know that, you know, the entire internet was for three or four
[01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:54.900]  years after his, probably starting from when he first got sick, even right, it wasn't even
[01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:59.580]  when he died, it was when he first had to take like a medical leave. You know, the internet
[01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:03.940]  was full of Apple will never survive without Steve Jobs, Apple, right, you know, doomed
[01:47:03.940 --> 01:47:08.700]  without Steve Jobs are doomed, they're doomed to doom, doom, doom, doom, you know, right
[01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:12.160]  to talk about infinite content, you could start reading those articles from that era
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:17.180]  and never, you'll die before you read. And they were wrong, obviously, Apple sort of
[01:47:17.180 --> 01:47:20.940]  to untold greater heights afterwards.
[01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:23.900]  So that's right. We all agree that that is that is absolutely true. Just look at the
[01:47:23.900 --> 01:47:26.700]  sacrifice, look at the valuation of the company, look at the amount of money they're making
[01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:32.620]  a by all vectors. That's true, right. But you could argue that that was just sort of
[01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:37.620]  this period of when everyone kept doing their jobs, as they were supposed to be doing from
[01:47:37.620 --> 01:47:42.140]  Tim Cook on down now that he had the new job, but still operations on down. And they were
[01:47:42.140 --> 01:47:47.500]  set up in such a way that this would always become not always, but in many cases would
[01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:52.860]  become this ultimate company because they could execute on those ideas. And I know that
[01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:58.600]  this is sort of a cliche, but pointing to the when they ran out of sort of the pipeline,
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:01.580]  would they ever be able to get out of them, you could argue that they've even done that
[01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:05.140]  pretty well. They, they didn't have the Apple Watch correct at first, but then they've been
[01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:09.740]  able to back into it. And the AirPods are a great product, right. But it still sort
[01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:14.500]  of feels like they have all of the talents around the table, but they they're missing
[01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:19.020]  just one piece. It's sort of like I'm reminded of the remember swingers, the movie from the
[01:48:19.020 --> 01:48:23.180]  90s. Yes, at one point there, there are two of the guys are like trying to have a conversation
[01:48:23.180 --> 01:48:26.980]  with the Mikey character of like, you're this bear with these big fucking claws, and you
[01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:30.740]  don't know what to do with these fucking claws. And I feel like that's sort of like Apple
[01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:35.360]  these days, they have all the pieces in place, but they're not quite sure what they should
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:40.820]  do with them. And so they're trying all these different things. But there is no sort of
[01:48:40.820 --> 01:48:44.660]  killer next thing. And maybe there never would have been right, even with Steve, who said
[01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:48.180]  who could say that there would have ever been that thing. But they have this great team
[01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:52.380]  in place. And they're executing on certain parts of it where they need to. They just
[01:48:52.380 --> 01:48:58.140]  don't quite have the thing to tie it all together to make the exact right calls in all of these
[01:48:58.140 --> 01:48:59.140]  circumstances.
[01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:07.580]  Yeah, I've said this before, I forget which episode. I do feel like one of the things
[01:49:07.580 --> 01:49:12.660]  that they're missing with Steve Jobs isn't the creation of big new thing. And watch an
[01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:17.300]  air pods are good examples. They, they could do it without him. I feel like maybe and he
[01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:21.580]  was good at that, of course, he famously good in, you know, world famously good. But the
[01:49:21.580 --> 01:49:27.560]  other thing that he was so good at was putting his finger on what was wrong. And saying this
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:35.640]  is wrong, fix it and holding people responsible. And, you know, again, it is dangerous territory
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:40.020]  for an Apple commentator podcaster to get into this, it wouldn't happen if Steve Jobs
[01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:47.240]  was still around. I would like to think that I have over the last seven, eight years, done
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:52.940]  a very good job of dancing around that, using it, you know, talking about it when it's apt,
[01:49:52.940 --> 01:49:56.320]  not not pretending like it's, you know, like, there is no difference between not having
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:00.080]  a but not overusing it. But I cannot help but think that this keyboard thing would have
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:07.020]  been fixed sooner, that I really feel like he was good at, at some point, you know, again,
[01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:10.400]  I don't think the problem with shipping this, this keyboard in the first place. And I've
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:13.360]  had arguments with Twitter on people, they're like, they should have known this keyboard
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:17.800]  was crap from the beginning. I'm sure that in their development of it, the keys weren't
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:22.040]  getting stuck. I don't know what rate the keys get stuck. But it's a low enough rate
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:26.040]  that I can see how it went through development and came out. And it seems like different
[01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:30.840]  keyboards are better than others. It seems like the people. Anecdotally, it seems like
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:35.080]  people who have the regular MacBook, the one port MacBook don't seem to have the problem
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:38.200]  as much as other people. I don't know why. But that's the one that shipped with it first,
[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:42.400]  I believe, because it needed to be so thin because the device is so crazy that but at
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:48.240]  some point in the three years since they've switched to this keyboard. And again, even
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:53.380]  if the data doesn't back it up, but I pretty sure that it does, that the data shows that
[01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:59.140]  these keyboards are far less reliable than Apple's all of Apple's previous MacBook and
[01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:03.520]  PowerBook keyboards to the dawn of time. Even if the data doesn't back it up, though, even
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:09.720]  if somebody can say, Look, here's our support rate. It's this, you know, it's 3.7%. And
[01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:15.360]  it used to be 3.5%. So it's two tenths of 1% difference, you know, from the previous
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:20.520]  generation, right, even if that's the case, the reputational harm is obviously real, because
[01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:25.200]  people are talking about it. Joanna Stern is mocking them in her Wall Street Journal
[01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:31.580]  column with an actual keyboard that is actually have as keys that don't work. You know, Casey
[01:51:31.580 --> 01:51:42.960]  Johnston has, you know, of all people to buy another. And started having spacebar problems.
[01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:43.960]  You know,
[01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:49.640]  and think about that in the context of, you know, you talked about the mobile me famous.
[01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:53.840]  You know, town hall thing that they did internally and and Steve Jobs was irate. But there was
[01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:58.640]  also that famous story right of when my Walt Mossberg gave the one bad review and like,
[01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:02.800]  you know, it's job said, like, Walt Mossberg is, is, you know, talking shit about this
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:07.340]  thing, right? So why aren't they doing that now? Right? Right. Like, and I can't help
[01:52:07.340 --> 01:52:12.920]  but fear I have reason to believe I don't want to go into it. It's all like third, maybe
[01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:17.720]  fourth hand, it is like so far whispered down the alley that it's not even worth taking
[01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:24.600]  is anything other than hope. But I have heard that there is a new keyboard in the works.
[01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:28.360]  And I don't know if it's I don't know if it is all a butterfly. I don't know what it is.
[01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:32.760]  But I've heard it has a bit more travel. I think they might be going back to the upside
[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:40.640]  down T on the arrows, I think. But I don't know how soon it's going to come out. And
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:46.740]  I think that's part of the problem too, with with today's Apple is that they, if it's not
[01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:51.460]  the iPhone, it's not that they don't care. It's not like they're, you know, and I feel
[01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:57.360]  like they're cautious about becoming over reliant on the overly reliant on the iPhone.
[01:52:57.360 --> 01:53:00.440]  And that's why they're pushing into services. And they realize that then maybe, you know,
[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:07.200]  they've reached peak iPhone years ago. But they just don't seem to be able to muster.
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:12.640]  Yeah, nice effort for anything. They still have to make decisions at the end of the day,
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:16.920]  but still the most important decisions while it's maybe a fading, while it's maybe peak
[01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:20.820]  iPhone, still the most important decisions have to be around the iPhone. So so, you know,
[01:53:20.820 --> 01:53:25.100]  somebody there, they've they've put a new keyboard into I mean, even if there were no
[01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:28.760]  problems with the keyboard, they tend to switch, you know, update keyboards every four or five
[01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:32.840]  years anyway. So I mean, it's not like it, but it just doesn't seem to me, though, that
[01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:39.280]  they treating this keyboard thing with the pants on fire intensity that they should have
[01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:43.880]  and that they're like, well, it's just the MacBook lineup. So we'll get to it. We'll
[01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:48.180]  get a new keyboard into the works. But, you know, this might be a 2020 thing or something
[01:53:48.180 --> 01:53:52.360]  by the time it ships and who knows how long it'll be before it ships across the tire lineup
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:57.900]  because they do things like let the MacBook Air sit unchanged for three or four years
[01:53:57.900 --> 01:54:01.580]  while they wait for Intel to come up with a chip that they like, etc.
[01:54:01.580 --> 01:54:05.560]  And so a large part of this is obviously just Apple operating at a scale that's unheard
[01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:09.380]  of. And certainly for them, you know, like 10 years ago, it was a much smaller scale.
[01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:14.120]  And so they didn't have to worry, let alone 20 years ago and whatnot, as much about just,
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:17.680]  you know, the word matriculating out about problems with things and they just didn't
[01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:21.800]  they weren't doing as much right. And so there wasn't nearly as much ground to cover. But
[01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:26.940]  it also feels like this is all related to, I guess, when I when I listened to you talk
[01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:31.760]  about it, the phrase I think about is like reading the room. And it's in this case, the
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:35.520]  room is sort of the world, right. But they're, they're getting, they seem to be a little
[01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:42.360]  bit worse these days at reading the room with regard to like, doing things like not only
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:46.620]  keyboard, which is an extreme example, but even things on down the line, like, you know,
[01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:51.340]  they obviously screwed up with the with the Mac Pro. And, and, you know, you could argue
[01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:54.480]  there were all sorts of reasons for that. And I'm sure there's lots of valid arguments
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:55:00.000]  for that. But they they're not thinking through sort of the second, the second tier effects
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:04.800]  of these decisions that they're making necessarily. And again, just at a higher level, reading
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:09.840]  the room about like, what, what they should sort of be focused on. And that's easy for
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:15.440]  us to say from afar, of course. But I do feel like we're seeing the degradation of various
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:21.440]  parts and products in some cases, because they're not quite reading the room, right.
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:27.200]  Yeah, maybe HomePod is a good example of that, too. It just in terms of, I like it, I think
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:30.480]  it sounds great. I really love having two of them in our kitchen. I think it sounds
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:37.640]  it, it occasionally just startles me how good it sounds. But it's 350 bucks a pop, right?
[01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:43.660]  29 or 329 a pop now. And just in terms of reading the room and reading, you know, like,
[01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:48.000]  and who knows, you know, they're all Bezos numbers. But, you know, Amazon says is the
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.760]  best selling sound system in the world, you know, and it's the $49 or whatever, you know,
[01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:56.040]  the one that who knows what they're selling, but they're clearly selling in quantity. And
[01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:59.480]  this seems to be the sort of fun purchased, you know, like, I want to be able to talk
[01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:05.880]  to my speaker and tell it to play music that people seem to want to spend like $100 on.
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:10.560]  Yeah. And I mean, I wrote, I wrote exactly about this, this thing before it launched,
[01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:14.560]  thinking, it's basically, I'm sure it'll be a good product. And it is a good product.
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:19.960]  It's just this, it's a mixture of the wrong strategy, sort of mixed with that, that leading
[01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:24.240]  them to create sort of the wrong price point of product, right? Because, and they could
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:28.080]  argue with their history, that they've always created products that are more expensive and
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:32.640]  more focused and or whatnot. And that's fine. And that's fine, until it's not, it's not
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:36.720]  correct anymore. It's not always to say that the same thing that worked in the past is
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:41.000]  going to work in the future. And I think you could, if you were reading the room correctly,
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.320]  as you know, like, some of us could from outside of the company, and, you know, obviously,
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:50.720]  a lot of people have said this, but like, I feel like you can read the room correctly
[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:56.000]  and then get to what the, what the sort of correct combination of things you should be
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:01.840]  focused on is. And I go back to again, sort of a head of product or whatever, whatever
[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:06.760]  sort of person in charge of that, that specific part of the company should be able to sort
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:08.960]  of at least steer the right direction for them.
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:14.920]  Yeah. And interesting. What if scenario that I was talking to somebody who actually works
[01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:21.580]  at Apple, you know, but, you know, but a friend, just as an interesting what if so to make
[01:57:21.580 --> 01:57:28.080]  a new lower tiered, you know, $750 iPhone in the 10 class family, they made the iPhone
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:31.840]  10 R. And I think the 10 R is doing pretty well. I don't think it's the new five C. I
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:36.680]  think it's doing pretty well. Yeah, but it was it's an all new device. They they went
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:42.160]  crazy on the screen. And like for cost purposes, they didn't want to go OLED like the 10 s
[01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:49.720]  and 10 s max. They went with an LCD screen, but to get it to go as close to the edges
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:56.560]  as they did all the way around all four sides was a tremendous effort. It's crazy what they
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:58:03.400]  did. Neelay I believe took a microscope with his XR review to show what they're doing at
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:08.720]  the corners. And then when you look at like a Google Pixel that has fake rounded corners,
[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:17.480]  you see it just how it's like, wow, literally cutting corners. Right. What if though, instead
[01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:23.600]  of spending all that effort on the 10 R they had done it for the lower priced iPads instead
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:26.860]  and you could have gotten you know, with these iPads they just released a couple of weeks
[01:58:26.860 --> 01:58:34.160]  ago like the new mini the new 9.7 model pro Yeah, what if they had gone and done or sorry
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:40.960]  the air it's not Yeah, the air right there. You know, they obviously didn't they obviously
[01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:45.680]  took a very cost efficient thing and said, Well, we'll just take the existing industrial
[01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:51.520]  design and we'll just update some components. And, you know, why didn't they go full 10
[01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:56.680]  R on those devices. And it's because I think institutionally, I think clearly could have
[01:58:56.680 --> 01:59:03.480]  the company has more money than God. It just isn't it. It's not enough to get their interest,
[01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:07.200]  right? Like they're just only the iPhone gets that sort of attention.
[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:12.840]  Yeah, that's an interesting, interesting question. Because I'm in the mind of like, so I was
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:18.560]  I'm a huge iPad mini fan and have been forever. And all I wanted is exactly what they finally
[01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:23.440]  gave us, right? The updated internals to the exact same form factor. And then so I'm super
[01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:24.840]  happy with that.
[01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:28.840]  Wouldn't you be happier though, if it went corner to corner?
[01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:36.120]  I think yes, right. So yes, but with a caveat that I don't. And this is a whole nother,
[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:40.200]  you know, can of worms, but I don't love the new iPad. I'm using it right now. I don't
[01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:48.760]  love the new iPad Pro design. I like the rounded sort of back form factor more of the old iPad
[01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:52.180]  Pro. I love the screen, you know, obviously, it's better not to have the bigger bezels
[01:59:52.180 --> 01:59:59.300]  on the, you know, the front of the screen. But would I trade that for the different back
[01:59:59.300 --> 02:00:04.000]  or the flatter sort of sides? I don't know, maybe. But an offshoot of your your question
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:09.480]  too is like, I think I'm not alone. And a lot of people are saying this and and I think
[02:00:09.480 --> 02:00:12.280]  you're talking about this with Moltz last week, right? Like where a lot of people still
[02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:19.180]  want the SE, right? A version of the SE. What should Apple make the iPhone mini, you know,
[02:00:19.180 --> 02:00:23.340]  some version of the SE again, versus doing a 10R type thing, because another problem
[02:00:23.340 --> 02:00:28.320]  with so I just I mentioned, you know, that I bought for for Megan, the 10S, the you know,
[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:34.240]  the smaller one, not the Max. And I was very sort of torn by that, because right now she
[02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:40.000]  has an iPhone 8. And she likes that size. She didn't want a bigger size. I know the
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:45.520]  10S is fairly close. It's just a bigger screen, obviously, but it's still bigger. And she
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:49.400]  didn't want bigger. And there's a lot of people in that in that camp. And instead, they made
[02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:55.760]  the 10R, which is actually bigger than the 10S. Right. And so another question like,
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:01:00.080]  would that would it have, you know, behooved Apple more to do small, you know, who's who's
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:04.560]  to say exactly. But I do think that these are interesting questions that you hope that
[02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:07.120]  they're debating quite rigorously internally.
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:12.360]  Yeah, when you're the only company that makes iPhones are, is three sizes enough? I mean,
[02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:16.960]  I don't know. And really, the 10R to me isn't really a third size. It's
[02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:19.960]  Yeah, something different.
[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:24.560]  Yeah, it is something different. There really are only two sizes of iPhones, you know, and
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:28.720]  it just if you're the only company and you're selling it to, you know, hundreds of millions
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:33.760]  of people, maybe there should be more, you know, it's, it's almost on you. It's highly
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:39.720]  unusual that that one company with so much at stake only makes two devices, you know,
[02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:42.600]  two, three devices for the entire lineup.
[02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:48.120]  Yeah. Especially given like, look at how many iPads they make how many different versions
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:54.480]  of the iPad they like the mini, the air, the pro, the regular, so they have more skews
[02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:55.680]  of the iPad, right?
[02:01:55.680 --> 02:02:00.820]  Yeah. Yeah, they do. And they're very different sizes, much more variety in the sizes than
[02:02:00.820 --> 02:02:06.840]  there are on the on the phone. Yeah, I don't know. It's, it's, it's unusual. Let me take
[02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:11.040]  a third break here and thank our third and final sponsor before we run way too long.
[02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:15.640]  It's our good friends at Casper, Casper products. They make sleep products, they make mattresses,
[02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:19.360]  they make sheets, they make everything you need for sleeping pillows. Look, you spend
[02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:23.800]  one third of your life sleeping. I spend way more than a third of my life sleeping. MG
[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:27.760]  spends less than a third of his life sleeping because he's got a baby. No matter how long
[02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:32.560]  you can sleep, you should be comfortable when you do make the most of that time. The experts
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:37.360]  at Casper work tirelessly to make a quality sleep surface that cradles your natural geometry
[02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:39.040]  and all the right places.
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:43.800]  The original Casper mattress combines multiple supportive memory foams for a quality sleep
[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:47.840]  surface with the right amount of sink and bounce. It's a great product. We've got one
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:52.000]  from when they first started sponsoring the show here. It's in my son's bedroom as good
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:55.600]  as new. I don't know how many years Casper's been sponsoring the show, but that mattress
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:03:01.040]  we got when they first started and it still is a fantastic mattress, brand new, feels
[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:05.480]  like it. Uh, it's got a breathable design. It helps you sleep cool, regulate your body
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:11.200]  temperature throughout the night. Super well regarded. It's got high, high marks at Casper's
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:17.320]  own website, Amazon and Google. Really it's become America's internet and America's favorite
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:21.320]  internet mattress. They've got two other mattresses now though, the wave and the essential, the
[02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:25.520]  wave features a patent pending premium support system to mirror the natural shape of your
[02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:30.560]  body. It's a high end product. And then the essential has a streamlined design at a price
[02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:35.200]  that won't keep you up at night. It's a lower price, but it's still a fantastic mattress.
[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:39.840]  They also have a wide array of other products, pillows, sheets, all that sort of good stuff.
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:43.160]  We've got a whole bunch of it from Casper. It's all really, really high quality stuff
[02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:48.400]  and it's all designed, developed and assembled right here in the United States. They've got
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:51.840]  affordable prices because they cut out the middleman. They don't have mattress stores.
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:56.360]  They don't sell to some retail type thing and then you got to go in there and uh, pay
[02:03:56.360 --> 02:04:01.520]  a markup. They sell direct to you and it's all delivered. These mattresses come to your
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:05.720]  door and these little tiny boxes. How in the world is that a queen or a king size mattress
[02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:09.680]  in a box like that? You'll find out when you open it up, follow their instructions and
[02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:14.160]  sucks all the air out of the room and just grows into a giant mattress. It's amazing.
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:20.040]  They've got free shipping and returns in the u s and Canada so you can be sure of your
[02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:25.360]  purchase with their hundred night risk free sleep on it. Trial, get it, sleep on it for
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:29.780]  three months and if you really don't like it, they'll take it back. No questions asked.
[02:04:29.780 --> 02:04:34.640]  Give you all your money back. That's how confident they are. Here's their special offer for you.

[02:04:59.940 --> 02:05:07.480]  answer to that about the state of Apple? I think so. I think it's, it's very complicated
[02:05:07.480 --> 02:05:14.180]  for a number of reasons of course, but it is, I, I, I'm curious what feedback we'll
[02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:19.200]  get on this, right? Because it's like, uh, uh, it is the discussion about is Apple doom
[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:23.760]  sort of, but it's also much more nuanced than that. And I feel like it is just, it's a very
[02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:28.600]  long discussion that's going to go on for years and years and years. And it's not like
[02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:35.580]  Apple is, I mean, the, the size and the scope at which Apple now operates, they're going
[02:05:35.580 --> 02:05:40.300]  to be around. If everything went wrong, if the, if the keyboard situation happened on
[02:05:40.300 --> 02:05:44.840]  every product, uh, across the line, they would still be around for another, you know, like
[02:05:44.840 --> 02:05:49.300]  40 years, 50 years, so much capital. They have so much cash in the bank. They just,
[02:05:49.300 --> 02:05:53.240]  it's uh, it's, it's silly to talk about a company being doomed, but it is interesting
[02:05:53.240 --> 02:06:00.640]  to think about which way the giant oil tanker of a, of a vessel is sort of moving, right?
[02:06:00.640 --> 02:06:06.420]  They could turn into the Apple that, that anti Apple critics have always said was Apple,
[02:06:06.420 --> 02:06:10.140]  which is that people just buy it for the Apple logo. People buy their crap products for the
[02:06:10.140 --> 02:06:13.660]  Apple logo. That's it. They just think it's cool. They could turn into that and still
[02:06:13.660 --> 02:06:19.360]  do well. You know, yes, a hundred percent. And I also think that it's interesting discussion
[02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:22.900]  in the context of what we're seeing now with Microsoft, right? Famously, they have turned
[02:06:22.900 --> 02:06:27.480]  the ship around with such a Nadella. They just hit the trillion dollar valuation mark
[02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:31.440]  the other day. So people were celebrating that again, just how much of a different company
[02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:35.860]  it is. Ben Thompson, a few other folks and I were having this long Twitter back and forth
[02:06:35.860 --> 02:06:41.140]  about what that means. Steven Sinofsky got involved. Um, and so, uh, you know, like how
[02:06:41.140 --> 02:06:46.480]  much of it was a full on pivot of the company versus just a change in leadership versus
[02:06:46.480 --> 02:06:51.680]  just time again, passing. Um, and sort of like my argument there that I, that I have
[02:06:51.680 --> 02:06:56.360]  in my head at least, and you know, I don't watch Microsoft nearly as closely, but like
[02:06:56.360 --> 02:07:01.820]  it does seem like that people are shitting on Balmer and, and in some cases rightfully
[02:07:01.820 --> 02:07:08.580]  so, I'm sure, but like he did in a way he helped them by putting the, the company, uh,
[02:07:08.580 --> 02:07:13.260]  getting the company to a point where it could be ready for change, right? Because it was
[02:07:13.260 --> 02:07:17.540]  such an extreme version of what Microsoft was under Bill Gates. And it was just, you
[02:07:17.540 --> 02:07:22.100]  know, sort of milking the profits and, and doing the extreme version of windows everywhere
[02:07:22.100 --> 02:07:28.420]  and all that kind of stuff where the company was then in the position to be ready for the
[02:07:28.420 --> 02:07:31.500]  services movement. And Sinofsky would argue that some of that stuff was put in place years
[02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:36.600]  in advance. And of course it was. Um, but the company was not ready to move at that
[02:07:36.600 --> 02:07:40.420]  point and needed, you know, maybe it's as simple as they needed the manager change right
[02:07:40.420 --> 02:07:44.380]  in order to, to institute some of these changes. And so thinking about that in the context
[02:07:44.380 --> 02:07:49.140]  of Apple, like Tim Cook, I do not want to compare Tim Cook to Steve Balmer, but like
[02:07:49.140 --> 02:07:54.820]  would, you know, is he the guy who's been executing it at an unseen pace and bringing
[02:07:54.820 --> 02:07:59.920]  in insane profits, but is there, you know, Tim Cook will eventually retire of course.
[02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:05.360]  And what happens to the, to the company as that next leader comes in? Is it a full on,
[02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:09.260]  is it a full on pivot? Obviously Tim Cook is trying to institute that sort of in a way
[02:08:09.260 --> 02:08:13.440]  right now with services, not a full on pivot maybe, but, but that being the next big part
[02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:17.760]  of growth. And so does a new leader come in and make that the full company, sort of like
[02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:21.060]  what Microsoft has done? Yeah, it's not, I wouldn't call it a pivot because to me a pivot
[02:08:21.060 --> 02:08:25.980]  means moving from something to something. Right. Whereas this is an expansion of what
[02:08:25.980 --> 02:08:30.080]  Apple does in a meaningful way. I guess I would say it's the pivot in the growth area
[02:08:30.080 --> 02:08:33.500]  of the company, right? Like the growth was the iPhone and it's no longer going to be
[02:08:33.500 --> 02:08:37.820]  iPhone. Now the growth is services. Right. And they don't, you know, well the watch is
[02:08:37.820 --> 02:08:46.420]  a big hit and the AirPods are a hit, but they just don't seem as interested in, well, for
[02:08:46.420 --> 02:08:50.300]  significant growth, you're never going to do it. I guess. No, you can't. It's the iPhone
[02:08:50.300 --> 02:08:54.660]  was the greatest business ever created up until this point, right? You cannot create
[02:08:54.660 --> 02:08:59.500]  another product that will be like that. And so I think they're, they've recognized that.
[02:08:59.500 --> 02:09:04.580]  And so what do you do? You have to create a whole slew of different things to, in order
[02:09:04.580 --> 02:09:10.200]  to create the level of a level of growth that sort of Wall Street appreciates that everyone
[02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:15.580]  else appreciates. When you're at the size of a company that Apple that's continues and
[02:09:15.580 --> 02:09:20.340]  hovers around the trillion dollar mark. Now I'm looking forward to, I feel like this is
[02:09:20.340 --> 02:09:27.900]  a, an important WWDC and I don't want to keep coming back to the Mac, but I feel like we've
[02:09:27.900 --> 02:09:34.300]  got like two contradictory narratives on where Apple's taking the Mac. There's this marzipan
[02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:42.340]  angle where technical aspects of it aside, they're, they're sort of turning it into the,
[02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:47.420]  in some ways at a consumer level, turning the Mac into a simplified iOS like computing
[02:09:47.420 --> 02:09:54.900]  device as opposed to being a computer, right? Right. Where the apps are sandboxed and some,
[02:09:54.900 --> 02:09:59.700]  you know, the, the, the, the apps that they, they're simple apps. The Apple news app doesn't
[02:09:59.700 --> 02:10:05.300]  even open multiple windows. It's just a one window app. And you know, we know that there,
[02:10:05.300 --> 02:10:09.260]  there's more of these marzipan apps coming and it's going to be a third party technology
[02:10:09.260 --> 02:10:13.260]  where developers are going to be able to use this to share more code. And is it all going
[02:10:13.260 --> 02:10:19.820]  to be in the interest of turning the Mac into more of an iOS like device as opposed to being
[02:10:19.820 --> 02:10:25.060]  a computer, a computer as a computer, or is this something they're doing alongside the
[02:10:25.060 --> 02:10:32.380]  Mac still being a powerhouse, the, the, the powerhouse workstation for serious pro level
[02:10:32.380 --> 02:10:35.840]  computing. And the thing I keep coming back to when I get worried as I keep coming back
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:42.780]  to the, the, that really unusual approach that they took to the Mac pro now, what, two
[02:10:42.780 --> 02:10:48.900]  years ago where they called a couple of us in and said, look, you know, we, we, we kind
[02:10:48.900 --> 02:10:53.260]  of screwed up with this trashcan Mac pro back to what did Federighi say? We backed ourselves
[02:10:53.260 --> 02:11:00.860]  into a painted ourselves into a thermal corner and said, we're gonna, you know, we're committed,
[02:11:00.860 --> 02:11:05.140]  you know, we have a pro iMac coming that we think is fantastic for a lot of our pro users
[02:11:05.140 --> 02:11:09.700]  told us about it months before, you know, six, seven months before it came out. It is
[02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:16.020]  a fantastic computer. It is a very serious pro computer. But they said, you know, two
[02:11:16.020 --> 02:11:20.020]  years in advance we're going to, we're still, but we know that some pro users need more
[02:11:20.020 --> 02:11:24.900]  and we're, we're committed to them. So is the company that's committed to this seemingly
[02:11:24.900 --> 02:11:31.100]  super expensive, powerful, and if it's taken them two years to make it ought to be pretty
[02:11:31.100 --> 02:11:35.660]  impressive, right? You know, you know, like I keep saying, like when they did this, there
[02:11:35.660 --> 02:11:39.800]  was so many people, so many nerds who want, you know, developer types who just want them
[02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:44.900]  to just make a big box like you used to just make a Mac pro and a big square box and put
[02:11:44.900 --> 02:11:50.420]  Intel's biggest chip in there and then screw it back together and ship it, you know, like,
[02:11:50.420 --> 02:11:54.540]  so whatever they're doing that that's taken two years, hopefully it's going to be impressive.
[02:11:54.540 --> 02:11:59.720]  Uh, I presume we're going to see it at WWDC. And so what I would really like to see is,
[02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:03.660]  is that they can walk into gum at the same time and that for typical users, they can
[02:12:03.660 --> 02:12:09.240]  turn the Mac, keep improving the Mac and maybe, you know, make it even simpler, make it more,
[02:12:09.240 --> 02:12:14.300]  you know, make some things that are the same as they are on the iPad. And at the same time
[02:12:14.300 --> 02:12:19.540]  for those who want and need it, keep the Mac as a very powerful computer, as a computer
[02:12:19.540 --> 02:12:23.580]  that you have, you, the user have all this, all the magical abilities you have when you
[02:12:23.580 --> 02:12:29.700]  can have your software and your scripts and your, uh, stuff really just have, have at
[02:12:29.700 --> 02:12:36.020]  it on the hardware. So I think that that is maybe the critical question of, yeah, this
[02:12:36.020 --> 02:12:41.260]  year going into 2020, can they thread, how do they even thread that needle and what are
[02:12:41.260 --> 02:12:44.940]  they looking to do threading that needle? Cause the other, the other avenue that's an
[02:12:44.940 --> 02:12:48.820]  offshoot of, of what you're talking about and where I think the Mac Pro and some of
[02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:52.680]  the other decisions they made were such mistakes was they looked at the absolute numbers and
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:59.420]  saw that it's not massive, certainly not compared to iOS. Um, but they didn't recognize perhaps
[02:12:59.420 --> 02:13:04.540]  the trickle down effects and also just the halo effect. Uh, you know, going back to the
[02:13:04.540 --> 02:13:09.860]  iPod days, but like the halo effect of something like the Mac Pro where it's like every single
[02:13:09.860 --> 02:13:16.740]  user in Hollywood was using a powerful Mac to create all of the movies that were all
[02:13:16.740 --> 02:13:21.120]  that we were all watching. Right. And they sort of, because that's like behind the scenes
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:25.620]  and you don't really think about it and, and they don't get love for it necessarily. They
[02:13:25.620 --> 02:13:29.360]  didn't think about like the halo effects and the trickle down effects of, of that part
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:33.540]  of the business where there are real ones and it's starting to get eaten into by other
[02:13:33.540 --> 02:13:38.420]  companies who are just focused more on that. Yeah. I, what you just said times a thousand
[02:13:38.420 --> 02:13:45.380]  a and I had a conversation with a friend recently, long time Mac developer, uh, who made the
[02:13:45.380 --> 02:13:55.100]  analogy to that car companies today don't, are moving away from making cars for enthusiast
[02:13:55.100 --> 02:14:00.980]  drivers. Um, like I'm not a car guy, so I can't think of the best examples. I wish I
[02:14:00.980 --> 02:14:05.780]  was more of one, but I'll just, just to name one, like back when I was younger, Honda used
[02:14:05.780 --> 02:14:10.620]  to have a car called the prelude and it was a perfect name. It was, and one of my friends,
[02:14:10.620 --> 02:14:15.100]  uh, parents had one and I thought it was the coolest car for like your parents to have.
[02:14:15.100 --> 02:14:20.540]  But the Honda prelude, it was such a great name is it would have technology that wasn't
[02:14:20.540 --> 02:14:25.820]  ready for like the accord and civic yet beforehand. And like the V tech engine that Honda has,
[02:14:25.820 --> 02:14:28.980]  I don't even know what the LV tech engine, I don't know what it means. I've got one.
[02:14:28.980 --> 02:14:33.220]  I have an Acura up in my, uh, the garage that has one. I don't know what it means cause
[02:14:33.220 --> 02:14:37.140]  I'm not a car guy. But like in the eighties when they first invented the V tech engine,
[02:14:37.140 --> 02:14:41.780]  it showed up in the prelude first and then, you know, and, and then it would trickle down
[02:14:41.780 --> 02:14:48.560]  to the accord years later. Yep. Uh, and that cars today are, they don't know what to do
[02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:51.420]  with them and that too many cars you buy, they're just, they're, they're heavy, they're
[02:14:51.420 --> 02:14:56.020]  too heavy and they've just got all sorts of crap you don't need in on the doors and stuff
[02:14:56.020 --> 02:15:00.580]  like that. Like the, cause they don't know what to do. And it's that loss of focus on
[02:15:00.580 --> 02:15:05.580]  the enthusiast market, even if it's only going to sell in truly insignificant to the company's
[02:15:05.580 --> 02:15:11.580]  financials numbers or maybe even be a bit of a loss because it, it doesn't, you know,
[02:15:11.580 --> 02:15:17.740]  it sells in such low numbers, but it keeps the company focused on that enthusiast market
[02:15:17.740 --> 02:15:23.520]  and keeps those drivers happy or in Apple's case keeps those Mac users happy who are genuine
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:29.900]  enthusiasts who want their computers to be super fast and super well made. Uh, there's
[02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:34.060]  a trickle, like you said, I'll just borrow your phrase. There's a trickle down effect
[02:15:34.060 --> 02:15:37.220]  that it's hard. I don't know that you can quantify it. I don't think it's, you know,
[02:15:37.220 --> 02:15:44.100]  it's intangibles. You can't measure that, that, that market. I think about the education
[02:15:44.100 --> 02:15:47.880]  market too. They sort of did a mea culpa there as well, right? Because they see the inroads
[02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:54.540]  that Chromebooks have had. Um, whereas they used to dominate the education markets. Um,
[02:15:54.540 --> 02:15:58.500]  and yeah, they just like, you know, they, they, they pulled back from these things because
[02:15:58.500 --> 02:16:04.000]  it's not, uh, the most obvious things, but, uh, for their bottom line perspective and
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:09.620]  or from just the scale perspective. Right. Um, but there are intangibles that I think
[02:16:09.620 --> 02:16:16.940]  that you really have to consider, right? Uh, you know, it's the, maybe it's a bad example,
[02:16:16.940 --> 02:16:25.100]  but like what I would like to see them do is the, to, to keep the edge is at the, at
[02:16:25.100 --> 02:16:32.980]  the nerd level, at the power user level on the Mac to, to keep that, keep that focus
[02:16:32.980 --> 02:16:37.500]  and to just prove, you know, exercise their muscles and keep that going is the same way
[02:16:37.500 --> 02:16:44.180]  that like with the original Apple watch, they came out with a $20,000 gold one, which clearly
[02:16:44.180 --> 02:16:49.540]  what, you know, it's a bad analogy cause it's a totally different type of thing. It's like
[02:16:49.540 --> 02:16:55.820]  the, the, the sensible objectively thinking nerd was the, we're the type of users who
[02:16:55.820 --> 02:17:01.540]  are like, what the, what the F is Apple doing and making $20,000 gold digital watches, but
[02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:08.220]  at the let's make a statement to the watch industry, let's flex our ability to work with
[02:17:08.220 --> 02:17:14.260]  new alloys and, and do stuff. I don't think that it looks, it's, it was a bit of a silly
[02:17:14.260 --> 02:17:18.140]  product, but I don't know that it was a mistake. I don't know that it was a bad idea because
[02:17:18.140 --> 02:17:23.020]  I think it was a way for Apple to sort of flex muscles in that area and send a message
[02:17:23.020 --> 02:17:28.340]  to the watch industry. Yeah. Like, and it really clearly wasn't worth their time financially.
[02:17:28.340 --> 02:17:33.180]  You know, it was not, it was, you know, it was not a popular product and I don't, I don't
[02:17:33.180 --> 02:17:38.180]  think anybody at Apple really ever thought it would be. But at that everything they do
[02:17:38.180 --> 02:17:44.560]  shouldn't necessarily be to make a hit product. I think some of it is just developing muscles
[02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:49.180]  in certain areas. I think that that is a, that is a great point. And I think it's an
[02:17:49.180 --> 02:17:53.940]  important point for a company again, that's, that operates at the scale and size that Apple
[02:17:53.940 --> 02:18:00.040]  does now because they have to recognize that not everything can be, certainly not, nothing
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:04.340]  can be the iPhone scale. And so what do you do, what are you as a company when you can't
[02:18:04.340 --> 02:18:09.900]  replicate that? And the answer is, I mean, there's a few answers that it could be, but
[02:18:09.900 --> 02:18:17.100]  it seems like the answer is doing a bunch of different things without going overboard
[02:18:17.100 --> 02:18:20.540]  and doing too much. They, you know, they're, they're famous things about what they, what
[02:18:20.540 --> 02:18:25.600]  they say no to and, and whatnot, but also they can push the envelope like you're talking
[02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:30.820]  about in ways that no other company can. Because if another company set out to do, you know,
[02:18:30.820 --> 02:18:36.420]  to use your, the gold, the gold Apple watch, but let's say it's a, let's say it's a $10,000
[02:18:36.420 --> 02:18:41.720]  Mac Pro, right? Companies cannot afford, most companies cannot afford to do that. They just
[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:46.740]  don't have the resources to do that, nor could they afford, you know, to that, to not sell
[02:18:46.740 --> 02:18:51.000]  in quantities without them, without it actually affecting the business. Apple can afford to
[02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:56.380]  do that kind of stuff. And they just have to recognize that it's maybe not going to,
[02:18:56.380 --> 02:19:00.240]  to move the needle in terms of growth, in terms of bottom line, but it does have these
[02:19:00.240 --> 02:19:04.660]  halo effects. It does have intangibles. It does have trickle down effects. Maybe that,
[02:19:04.660 --> 02:19:07.540]  you know, like you're talking about, those components eventually make their way into
[02:19:07.540 --> 02:19:13.580]  the next MacBook Pro. And now they have a better sense of what people use that for.
[02:19:13.580 --> 02:19:19.240]  They have a better sense of, of just pushing the envelope. They have a better sense of
[02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:24.400]  staying at the cutting edge, being state of the art. And because the iPhone became such
[02:19:24.400 --> 02:19:29.860]  a mass market phenomenon, whereas no other Apple product was like that previously, besides
[02:19:29.860 --> 02:19:35.040]  I guess the iPod was the first one, but not at that scale. They're just a different company
[02:19:35.040 --> 02:19:38.860]  now and not used to doing things that aren't going to be at mass scale. And why don't they
[02:19:38.860 --> 02:19:42.340]  get back to that? That's sort of their, that was their bread and butter in the earlier
[02:19:42.340 --> 02:19:43.340]  days, right?
[02:19:43.340 --> 02:19:49.580]  Right. Yeah. I'm not asking for 500 no's for every 500 yeses, you know, keep it a thousand
[02:19:49.580 --> 02:19:59.180]  no's to every yes. But maybe, you know, a few more yeses for good ideas that would be
[02:19:59.180 --> 02:20:04.300]  useful. You know, that would be interesting for Apple strategically, even if the result
[02:20:04.300 --> 02:20:06.500]  isn't the bottom line.
[02:20:06.500 --> 02:20:10.740]  And that's that, that's almost like the Amazon mentality when you think about it, that right,
[02:20:10.740 --> 02:20:14.740]  where it's like the Fire Phone total disaster, yet it may, you know, they would argue that
[02:20:14.740 --> 02:20:20.900]  it birthed the Alexa and, you know, subsequent other, I just triggered the, as you say, dingus.
[02:20:20.900 --> 02:20:30.380]  I have actually I have a home, there's Alexa, I have a HomePod, a Google Home and the other
[02:20:30.380 --> 02:20:39.820]  one. So I'm real brisk. But yes, but so like the Amazon mentality of it, basically, there's,
[02:20:39.820 --> 02:20:44.380]  you don't want to say throwing stuff at a wall and see what sticks, but you do. There
[02:20:44.380 --> 02:20:48.740]  we go. I'm muting her. You don't want to throw things at a wall and see what sticks but at
[02:20:48.740 --> 02:20:57.700]  the same time, you do want to push the envelope, right? Even if you don't even, you know, yeah,
[02:20:57.700 --> 02:21:01.700]  even if you don't think it's going to be a smash hit, that's my one of my big concerns
[02:21:01.700 --> 02:21:05.700]  about Apple is if they don't see it as being a big hit, they don't that it doesn't get
[02:21:05.700 --> 02:21:10.640]  their interest and they don't try. You know, and I don't I'm not convinced of it. It's
[02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:11.640]  just a worry.
[02:21:11.640 --> 02:21:17.380]  Yeah, I think I think it's a very relevant worry in this time, especially because they're
[02:21:17.380 --> 02:21:23.540]  trying to, you know, so like the services, services, services, services, everyone knows
[02:21:23.540 --> 02:21:27.980]  car thing is still seems like, you know, it's the big team working on that, that they have
[02:21:27.980 --> 02:21:31.920]  layoffs and then they hire more people. And then of course, the glasses thing is the other
[02:21:31.920 --> 02:21:36.540]  thing that's like the worst kept secret out here that many people on that team, it seems
[02:21:36.540 --> 02:21:40.600]  like are working on some sort of newfangled product. And so they probably feel like from
[02:21:40.600 --> 02:21:45.500]  their perspective, look, we have these these sort of three things services, the car, the
[02:21:45.500 --> 02:21:49.580]  glasses thing that are that are sort of our go forward strategy thing. So we can't sort
[02:21:49.580 --> 02:21:53.300]  of, you know, we were we are pushing the envelope, we don't need to do anything else. And like,
[02:21:53.300 --> 02:21:57.300]  I think our, our sort of summation of what we're talking about here is just like, remember
[02:21:57.300 --> 02:22:03.060]  the stuff that you already have. And don't lose sight of that. And don't, don't think
[02:22:03.060 --> 02:22:09.660]  that you can't, can't sort of revisit some of those things. And at the same time, and
[02:22:09.660 --> 02:22:14.740]  don't cheap out on it. Like, that's my, my, I don't think this is the case. I'm optimistic.
[02:22:14.740 --> 02:22:19.420]  But you know, if the whole if, if WWDC comes and goes, and we see these new marzipan apps
[02:22:19.420 --> 02:22:23.740]  from Apple, and it really just looks like, oh, they're just trying to cheap out and only,
[02:22:23.740 --> 02:22:27.980]  you know, just click a button in Xcode and have the iPad app shipped on the Mac, so they
[02:22:27.980 --> 02:22:36.000]  don't have to have a Mac team doing these apps. That's bad, right? Like, you know, yeah,
[02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:42.060]  you know, I, what is your read on why they're doing the Yeah, I know, we're we're going
[02:22:42.060 --> 02:22:47.100]  pretty long here. But what is your read on why they're doing marzipan? Is it so much
[02:22:47.100 --> 02:22:51.820]  that there's the developer community is so massive for iOS that this opens up a whole
[02:22:51.820 --> 02:22:57.000]  new avenue for them with the Mac? Or is it the flip side, the worst version, which is
[02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:02.320]  that this is sort of the beginning of the graceful fade of the Mac, and it just melts
[02:23:02.320 --> 02:23:05.420]  more into an iOS device?
[02:23:05.420 --> 02:23:10.540]  I don't know, I feel like what we knew what we learned last year wasn't enough to know.
[02:23:10.540 --> 02:23:15.600]  So that's why that's really that, that question. And to me is what I want. And that's the question
[02:23:15.600 --> 02:23:25.580]  I want answers from it WWDC this year. I, I think that part of it is a vague goal to
[02:23:25.580 --> 02:23:33.900]  get more apps that aren't even on the Mac at all, to get these developers to go through
[02:23:33.900 --> 02:23:39.060]  the whatever you have to do to get your iOS app to become a marzipan Mac app, right and
[02:23:39.060 --> 02:23:45.100]  do it. But I kind of feel like Apple might be wrong there that it's going to work. I
[02:23:45.100 --> 02:23:49.440]  don't think I don't think there's I don't think there's anything they can do to make
[02:23:49.440 --> 02:23:55.300]  it so quote unquote, easy to get a Mac version that's going to get them to stop shipping,
[02:23:55.300 --> 02:24:00.480]  you know, like get slack to stop shipping slack for Mac as a giant 300 gigabyte electron
[02:24:00.480 --> 02:24:02.540]  turd.
[02:24:02.540 --> 02:24:10.340]  I think you're right that that's the likely outcome. And that's troublesome, right? Because
[02:24:10.340 --> 02:24:15.780]  it means that they're both distracted by this weird initiative. And if it backfires, it
[02:24:15.780 --> 02:24:20.740]  just looks like they're just like sort of launching this weird amalgamation of software
[02:24:20.740 --> 02:24:25.840]  that people aren't going to use or shouldn't use. And so what, you know, what is the ultimate
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:30.100]  purpose through they did then just backtrack? Like, is it like the, you know, something
[02:24:30.100 --> 02:24:37.180]  that they tried and then they don't do? I do worry that it's they'll obviously say we
[02:24:37.180 --> 02:24:40.900]  already know what they're going to say, because they've said it many times, like, the Mac
[02:24:40.900 --> 02:24:46.340]  and iOS are different, different things, different beasts, different devices, they're always
[02:24:46.340 --> 02:24:50.840]  going to coexist together. And I think we can all agree like that always is certainly
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:54.740]  not true. Like it's not always it's not in 100 years, are we going to have both of them
[02:24:54.740 --> 02:25:02.100]  unlikely. So the question is, when does it? When do we cross the point? And is this a
[02:25:02.100 --> 02:25:08.220]  step in that direction? Even if inadvertently, right, right.
[02:25:08.220 --> 02:25:12.220]  At a certain level, and I'm not gonna turn this into a developer podcast, but basically
[02:25:12.220 --> 02:25:17.220]  Mac apps are written in a framework called AppKit. And AppKit dates all the way back
[02:25:17.220 --> 02:25:25.420]  to like 1989 or 1990. Next, and the frameworks, you know, some of them have continuity all
[02:25:25.420 --> 02:25:35.500]  the way from 1989 to now. UI kit, so the iOS has never had AppKit. iOS replaces AppKit
[02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:41.180]  with something called UI kit. And basically what for stall and his team did in the development
[02:25:41.180 --> 02:25:46.340]  of the original iPhone. And they were all you know, like for stall was an old next hand.
[02:25:46.340 --> 02:25:52.940]  They all knew the team making it new AppKit in and out. It was a sort of okay, it's 2005
[02:25:52.940 --> 02:25:58.020]  2006. What would we do differently in AppKit now knowing now that we didn't know then what
[02:25:58.020 --> 02:26:04.780]  what what can we improve? What can we what's awkward and lengthy and verbal? You know,
[02:26:04.780 --> 02:26:09.880]  if the type a lot of code to do this in AppKit, what could we do in UI kit to make it easier?
[02:26:09.880 --> 02:26:16.060]  And so, you know, there's a lot of developers who think UI kit is easier than AppKit. Right.
[02:26:16.060 --> 02:26:20.980]  And it's a lot easier to go from AppKit to UI kit. So if you were a Mac developer, back
[02:26:20.980 --> 02:26:24.500]  when the iPhone came out, you could go to UI kit and say, Oh, I see this is just like
[02:26:24.500 --> 02:26:28.740]  blank, blank, blank, and stuff was even though stuff was different, it was usually easier.
[02:26:28.740 --> 02:26:33.820]  Whereas the vice versa is harder, seemingly, that UI kit developers, you know, developers
[02:26:33.820 --> 02:26:37.860]  who make iPhone apps, if they go and look at the Mac, they think, Well, this looks like
[02:26:37.860 --> 02:26:42.620]  a lot more work than what I'm used to. I could just do XYZ here, I have to go all the way
[02:26:42.620 --> 02:26:50.540]  from A to Z here. Long story short. So the idea might be if the optimistic sense is that
[02:26:50.540 --> 02:26:56.740]  this is just Apple's strategy for keeping the Mac vibrant for years to come. And here
[02:26:56.740 --> 02:27:05.500]  is a better, more modern way to make truly rich Mac apps that are, you know, as Mac like
[02:27:05.500 --> 02:27:11.780]  as you could hope for, but a better way for new frameworks and a modern set of API's for
[02:27:11.780 --> 02:27:17.460]  developers, like a lot less about, hey, just click this one checkbox in your iPad app turns
[02:27:17.460 --> 02:27:22.540]  into a Mac app and a lot more. Hey, we've got a whole week worth of sessions for you
[02:27:22.540 --> 02:27:26.540]  developers where we cannot wait to tell you and you can dig in and you can make these
[02:27:26.540 --> 02:27:33.060]  rich thorough, as deep as you want powerful as you want Mac apps, using a more modern
[02:27:33.060 --> 02:27:37.420]  set of API's. And if you're an iPhone developer, you're going to find this a lot more comfortable.
[02:27:37.420 --> 02:27:42.980]  So I love that narrative. And I hope that that's the case for sure. Is there something?
[02:27:42.980 --> 02:27:48.380]  Is there an offshoot of that, which also perhaps makes it easier for when they of course, transition
[02:27:48.380 --> 02:27:52.260]  the MacBook to the a series chips? Is there something about that?
[02:27:52.260 --> 02:27:56.420]  I don't think so. Because I don't know. I mean, to me, it would be worrisome if they
[02:27:56.420 --> 02:28:00.440]  go that way. And then they say, and the only Mac apps that make the transition are these
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:07.660]  marzipan apps, right? I think that the way that I don't think there's anything related
[02:28:07.660 --> 02:28:12.400]  to Mac apps as we know them in app kit that would prevent them from cross compiling to
[02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:19.900]  a series ARM chips. And most developers I know, at least ever since the power PC to
[02:28:19.900 --> 02:28:26.420]  Intel switch have been like, if they got caught with code that didn't easily go from power
[02:28:26.420 --> 02:28:31.460]  PC to Intel, they're never going to make that mistake again. Like, I think Adobe will be
[02:28:31.460 --> 02:28:35.940]  ready to go. I think Microsoft Adobe in particular would be the one that's more important because
[02:28:35.940 --> 02:28:44.040]  Adobe's apps are more performance. Right, right. oriented. Yeah. So I don't think so.
[02:28:44.040 --> 02:28:48.460]  But it could be you know, it could be just for not for technical reasons that that developers
[02:28:48.460 --> 02:28:53.820]  couldn't just cross like a new version of Xcode that spits out ARM Mac apps. Most I
[02:28:53.820 --> 02:28:58.660]  think most Mac apps would just be just click a button in the toolbar and Xcode and out
[02:28:58.660 --> 02:29:03.360]  pops an app that runs natively on both. I don't think I don't think they need this switch
[02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:11.500]  for that. But we shall see. Anyway, we've run over our allotted time. I don't know if
[02:29:11.500 --> 02:29:14.920]  there's anything else you wanted to talk about. But I could I could I could say we wrap this
[02:29:14.920 --> 02:29:15.920]  up.
[02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:20.460]  We'll wrap it up and talk again. And earlier than two years earlier than two years.
[02:29:20.460 --> 02:29:26.100]  mg Siegler, thank you very much. You're, you've got your your website now that you do most
[02:29:26.100 --> 02:29:34.340]  your writing is 500 ish.com. Yes. 500 500 ish.com 500 ish words at a time. Do you ever
[02:29:34.340 --> 02:29:36.540]  pay attention to the word count? Do you?
[02:29:36.540 --> 02:29:40.100]  I tried to when I first started doing it a few years, several years ago at this point,
[02:29:40.100 --> 02:29:43.700]  but now I mean, you know, you know, the way it goes, you sit down to write something and
[02:29:43.700 --> 02:29:48.840]  the 500 turns into 1000 in no time. And so yeah, I would I would I guess that on average,
[02:29:48.840 --> 02:29:52.900]  they're like 800 most of the time. Yeah, that's one thing that's funny. I've said this before,
[02:29:52.900 --> 02:29:57.460]  like, I if I grew up in a different era, I'm sure I could do it. And I used to write in
[02:29:57.460 --> 02:30:01.220]  a in a college newspaper, and there were definite space constraints, you know, there was a minimum
[02:30:01.220 --> 02:30:08.660]  and a maximum length to an op ed column. But I've really lost that muscle. Like, I wrote
[02:30:08.660 --> 02:30:13.340]  a back page columns for Mac world occasionally, and they were very tightly constrained. I
[02:30:13.340 --> 02:30:19.420]  mean, there was like, it was a very narrow range of, like 50 words, like, you need, you
[02:30:19.420 --> 02:30:25.940]  know, it was it was hard. And like, I still I admire like the New York Times op ed columnists,
[02:30:25.940 --> 02:30:29.800]  like Paul Krugman, who they're, they have to write a column that's almost the exact
[02:30:29.800 --> 02:30:34.580]  same length, like twice a week, every week. I know, I don't have that muscle anymore at
[02:30:34.580 --> 02:30:38.180]  all. Like, if I want to people talk about, of course, it's much harder to write, you
[02:30:38.180 --> 02:30:43.460]  know, succinctly than it is to blather on. But and I think that that's absolutely true.
[02:30:43.460 --> 02:30:49.140]  I did set it up more to like, it was more to try to force myself to write in the post
[02:30:49.140 --> 02:30:52.820]  sort of reporter days, right to force myself to give myself an easy target, right to write
[02:30:52.820 --> 02:30:58.260]  every day. And it's just so much easier said than done. Because you're like, what do I
[02:30:58.260 --> 02:31:02.500]  cut? I don't know what to cut here. And then do you write a second story about the thing
[02:31:02.500 --> 02:31:07.340]  that you cut and all that stuff? Yeah, yeah. So anyway, that's your website. 500 is words.
[02:31:07.340 --> 02:31:10.700]  I look forward to every one of your columns. I like it. And then on Twitter, people can
[02:31:10.700 --> 02:31:16.980]  follow you, of course, at MG siegler. Yes, just just search for MG siegler. Twitter will
[02:31:16.980 --> 02:31:43.940]  take you right there. Thank you.
