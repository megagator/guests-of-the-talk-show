[00:00.000 --> 00:05.360]  I have in front of me, and there's so much to talk about, but in front of me right now,
[00:05.360 --> 00:10.560]  my hands are on it, is the one product from Apple that everybody wants to hear my thoughts about.
[00:12.000 --> 00:16.320]  You know what it is. It's the cloth. It's the polishing cloth.
[00:18.000 --> 00:21.520]  Sorry, I ruined your reveal. I should have played dumb. I should have played stupid.
[00:22.240 --> 00:28.240]  It's the MacBook Pro. Nope, you know. Nope, I blew it. I blew it with a heavy-handed intro.
[00:28.240 --> 00:35.360]  You telegraphed it too much. What I did is I bought a 14-inch. I keep wanting to say 13-inch.
[00:35.360 --> 00:40.720]  That's going to be a hard habit to break. For some reason, when the 15-inch ones went to 16,
[00:40.720 --> 00:48.160]  I found that easy. Fourteen's new, right? They never had a 14 before. There was a 12-inch MacBook.
[00:48.160 --> 00:56.560]  They never had 16 before either. They used to have 13, 15, 17, which in hindsight was kind of weird,
[00:56.560 --> 01:01.360]  but I've often said this. You know who is a huge fan of the 17-inch PowerBook? My wife.
[01:02.320 --> 01:03.920]  Oh, really? She still misses it.
[01:03.920 --> 01:05.520]  Wow. Because she likes to have
[01:05.520 --> 01:11.120]  the biggest screen possible, but she hasn't had a home office set up in,
[01:11.840 --> 01:18.560]  God, might be decades at this point. She kind of needs to do her MacBooking from the kitchen.
[01:18.560 --> 01:21.600]  We have plenty of room in the kitchen and stuff like that, but an iMac,
[01:21.600 --> 01:28.800]  which would really satisfy her desire for a big, huge screen, would only go into a room
[01:28.800 --> 01:32.240]  all the way on the top floor that she wouldn't want to spend a lot of time in.
[01:33.440 --> 01:39.920]  And it's good she doesn't listen to the show, but I often feel like I could just buy it for her,
[01:39.920 --> 01:43.920]  but honestly, I worry that she would think I'm trying to get rid of her.
[01:43.920 --> 01:53.520]  Like, why don't you go upstairs? But anyway, she loved the 17-inch, the old lunch tray,
[01:53.520 --> 01:59.520]  but 16-inch is a nice medium in between, where it's less of a footprint on your desk,
[02:00.160 --> 02:05.600]  more likely to fit on an airplane tray or whatever. 14-inch is getting hard for me.
[02:05.600 --> 02:12.400]  I'll get used to it, I guess. But anyway, I ordered the 14-inch MacBook Pro with everything
[02:12.400 --> 02:20.480]  stupidly maxed out, which I don't need, but I just want. It is maybe my midlife crisis.
[02:20.480 --> 02:28.880]  Instead of buying a sports car, I've bought a laptop that costs several thousand dollars extra.
[02:29.520 --> 02:33.520]  Well, we used to spend, I mean, I used to spend a lot more. I was looking it up because I was
[02:33.520 --> 02:37.440]  trying to figure out what the most that I had spent was, and I think it was, I can't remember,
[02:37.440 --> 02:43.120]  it was the 400 megahertz, the 1 gigahertz, but one of those two titanium power books was like 2,600
[02:43.120 --> 02:52.320]  bucks. I was doing a little bit of programming back then, so I probably used it a bit for that,
[02:52.320 --> 03:02.320]  but I probably didn't use it to capacity either. I have spent more than that in the past. I don't
[03:02.320 --> 03:07.680]  know that this might be, I don't think it's the most expensive MacBook I've ever bought, but
[03:07.680 --> 03:16.000]  it's more than I need, and I could always justify it before because I need the RAM. I really do use
[03:16.000 --> 03:23.280]  RAM because I sloppily leave hundreds of browser tabs open, and it's nice. It is nice to just keep
[03:23.280 --> 03:27.760]  opening all the apps, every app you use, and just keep them all running and not worry about it.
[03:27.760 --> 03:34.240]  But in the old days, when you ran out of RAM on a Mac, well, in the really old days, of course,
[03:34.240 --> 03:40.080]  you'd buy more. You'd put Ram Doubler in. No, but like in the classic, well, you'd either
[03:40.080 --> 03:44.080]  put Ram Doubler in, or in classic, it would just tell you there's not enough memory to launch an
[03:44.080 --> 03:52.240]  application. Everything would stop. It made sense, and then until it didn't make sense.
[03:53.200 --> 03:56.720]  In the 80s, it made perfect sense. Well, of course, if you don't have enough memory,
[03:56.720 --> 04:02.400]  you can't open any more applications. But in the early days of Mac OS X, when they switched to the
[04:02.400 --> 04:09.920]  Unix philosophies, you never really run out of memory. It just uses disk space as swap,
[04:10.640 --> 04:17.600]  and we'll just swap it out. It used to be so slow because you had spinning hard disks,
[04:17.600 --> 04:24.240]  and even the RAM was slower compared to today. When you actually ran out of real
[04:24.240 --> 04:29.120]  RAM for what you wanted to do, you'd notice it. I mean, you'd actually hear the hard drive going,
[04:29.120 --> 04:33.600]  or you could feel it under your palm or wherever the hard drive was on your laptop.
[04:35.680 --> 04:41.040]  And then that stopped being so much of an issue. And I have to say, testing out last year's
[04:41.040 --> 04:48.320]  13-inch M1 MacBook Pro, I would go look in Activity Monitor and see that I was using
[04:48.320 --> 04:55.040]  way more than the 16 gigabytes of RAM that were in the machine, and that swap was up at 10 gigabytes
[04:55.040 --> 05:02.080]  or something like that. And I didn't notice because it's all so fast. The SSD is fast.
[05:02.080 --> 05:11.200]  But anyway, I bought a stupidly fast M1 Mac's 14-inch MacBook Pro. It is not here yet. I believe
[05:11.200 --> 05:16.720]  it is coming soon. But when I ordered it down at the bottom, when they give you the, hey, do you
[05:16.720 --> 05:24.880]  want to buy some add-on stuff? This is when Apple turns pure retail. Because why not? I'm not even
[05:24.880 --> 05:31.040]  complaining about it. This is what you do if you're selling stuff. You put some mints at the
[05:31.040 --> 05:37.040]  checkout counter. You want to buy some gum? Well, they had that $19 polishing cloth.
[05:39.760 --> 05:43.440]  Well, once you spent that much money, $19 for a polishing cloth doesn't seem like anything.
[05:43.440 --> 05:53.280]  Right. For me, it was the perfect little add-on. And it really is like the John Travolta
[05:53.280 --> 05:59.280]  Uma Thurman scene in Pulp Fiction where they go out to eat to the diner. And she buys,
[05:59.280 --> 06:03.120]  I forget how expensive the milkshake is. Amy and I just watched that movie recently.
[06:03.680 --> 06:10.480]  And it's been so many years that it doesn't even sound like an expensive milkshake. It sounds like
[06:10.480 --> 06:17.520]  what you would order at any restaurant. You just pop into a Red Robin or any chain. This is what
[06:17.520 --> 06:22.000]  milkshakes cost. But he's like, I got to see what a $10 milkshake cost. I don't remember what the
[06:22.000 --> 06:33.760]  cost. I had to see what a $19 Apple polishing cloth was like. It is very nice. It comes in like
[06:33.760 --> 06:43.680]  a sleeve or like a case almost. Well, it's like a paper envelope, but it is a little three
[06:43.680 --> 06:52.240]  dimensional. The envelope, the cardboard box that it comes in is almost exactly the dimensions of a
[06:52.240 --> 07:02.640]  standard personal checkbook. Do you remember writing checks? I still do. I'm 109 years old.
[07:02.640 --> 07:10.640]  We do too, but it's like every time I do, I can still see checks from 2019 are on the same page
[07:10.640 --> 07:17.520]  of the ledger, but it's the size of a checkbook. It is not very heavy. It comes not in a ridiculously
[07:17.520 --> 07:25.360]  sized shipping box, but it is far larger than a checkbook. And of course, it's review season.
[07:25.360 --> 07:30.560]  Apple is sending me products to review. Most of them like with the MacBook all came in one big
[07:30.560 --> 07:36.240]  box. If they're going to give you extra stuff, like I got the MacBook and spoiler for something
[07:36.240 --> 07:42.800]  I want to talk about in a bit with you, the third generation AirPods, were all sent together in one
[07:43.760 --> 07:53.760]  meta box from Apple to me, the reviewer, but I've ordered other stuff. You forget what you ordered
[07:53.760 --> 07:58.880]  and what's coming. I could tell it was an Apple product, but I had this sinking feeling at first
[07:58.880 --> 08:05.680]  when the FedEx guy handed it to me that I'd gotten ripped off, that it was an empty box.
[08:06.880 --> 08:16.800]  Because nothing rattled inside. They use a bit of cellophane to strap the small product box within
[08:16.800 --> 08:27.360]  the larger brown shipping box. So nothing rattled and it sure as shit felt empty. There was also
[08:27.360 --> 08:32.880]  sort of a look on the FedEx guy's face like, hey, this box looks like it's still sealed up.
[08:33.600 --> 08:41.920]  We didn't say anything. It was maybe a second, two seconds before I thought,
[08:41.920 --> 08:47.200]  oh, it's the polishing cloth. I was like, I did buy something stupidly light.
[08:47.200 --> 08:48.960]  I'm surprised those aren't back ordered already though.
[08:50.320 --> 08:52.880]  I heard that they were. I don't know.
[08:52.880 --> 08:55.920]  Okay, so you got it, but you don't have your MacBook yet.
[08:55.920 --> 09:01.040]  No, no. But even when I ordered them together, they had very different shipping dates.
[09:03.760 --> 09:11.280]  The cloth itself is surprisingly thick. I don't know what it's made of. It feels like suede.
[09:11.280 --> 09:16.720]  It's not like a terrycloth type thing. It feels like suede. I'm guessing it's not suede,
[09:16.720 --> 09:25.520]  but it's some sort of artificial material. It's a light gray that is darker than a silver MacBook,
[09:25.520 --> 09:30.720]  but lighter than a space gray MacBook. It has a very nice feel, round corners,
[09:31.440 --> 09:41.360]  an embossed Apple logo in the lower right corner. It wipes the screen about as good as
[09:42.560 --> 09:48.480]  gets grease off the screen and little dots off the screen, exactly as well as every other
[09:48.480 --> 09:55.840]  anti-static cloth I've been using that I've probably bought for $2 on Amazon.
[09:55.840 --> 09:56.400]  It's not $18.
[09:57.840 --> 10:03.760]  My mother-in-law, God bless her, often struggles with—I'm very hard to buy gifts for. You probably
[10:03.760 --> 10:09.680]  are too, because there's not a lot of stuff I like. I'm picky about it. Usually, if there's
[10:09.680 --> 10:14.000]  something I need, I just buy it for myself. That's always a problem.
[10:14.000 --> 10:18.880]  Yes. My mother-in-law always wants to buy me some stuff for Christmas, like stocking stuffer type
[10:18.880 --> 10:27.280]  stuff. One time, somehow, she found out that I like to have a nice cleaning cloth for my stuff.
[10:27.280 --> 10:33.520]  I don't want to—you're not supposed to use paper towels to wipe screens. She got me these ones that
[10:33.520 --> 10:39.760]  I think that they're meant—they seem clearly more meant for washing a car. Because they're so
[10:39.760 --> 10:47.760]  big. They're enormous. It's like a napkin you could easily—even if you have a very large nap,
[10:47.760 --> 10:55.120]  you could cover your lap with it. But they're great. But they're more of like a terrycloth
[10:55.120 --> 11:02.080]  type thing. Do you know what I mean? There's little threads. Super soft, and they work great.
[11:02.080 --> 11:05.600]  But I'm betting you can find the equivalent for a lot less.
[11:05.600 --> 11:11.280]  Right. I'm not quite sure why Apple makes this other than the fact that
[11:11.280 --> 11:14.320]  people like me are just going to click the button.
[11:14.320 --> 11:16.480]  Because they got an additional $18 out of you.
[11:16.480 --> 11:24.160]  Yeah, $19. Now, here's the other interesting thing. Because I believe that this same cloth
[11:24.160 --> 11:34.320]  ships with the Pro Display XDR with the infamously expensive $5,000 6K display that comes—or
[11:34.320 --> 11:40.240]  doesn't come with, but has an optional $1,000 stand. And there's a little card that comes
[11:40.240 --> 11:45.280]  in the box. And it says, it's got it written in four languages, but the English version says,
[11:45.280 --> 11:54.480]  safe for use on all Apple displays and surfaces. For infrequent cleaning of hard to remove smudges
[11:54.480 --> 12:04.480]  on nano-textured glass, a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution may be used. Now, the nano-textured
[12:04.480 --> 12:08.800]  glass, I was like, what the hell products do I have in nano-textured glass? Then I remembered,
[12:08.800 --> 12:13.600]  that's what they call the matte finish XDR display. Right?
[12:13.600 --> 12:16.960]  Okay, so only one kind of XDR display.
[12:16.960 --> 12:21.920]  One kind of XDR display, which I think is actually more expensive. Who knows, though,
[12:21.920 --> 12:27.040]  the way they wrote this, the way that they don't mention the Pro Display XDR specifically,
[12:27.040 --> 12:33.360]  perhaps they have plans in the future to have other nano-textured displays and their forward
[12:34.320 --> 12:43.120]  thinking in their warning. But I actually think—this is my genuine complaint—I actually
[12:43.120 --> 12:49.120]  think that this is insufficient instructions. Because—
[12:49.120 --> 12:54.560]  Oh, yeah. I think so, too. I mean, you have to do research in order to figure out which
[12:54.560 --> 12:56.720]  thing you can use it on. Right. You have to do research
[12:56.720 --> 13:04.560]  to know which one. How am I supposed to use the 70% isopropyl alcohol? Am I supposed to apply
[13:04.560 --> 13:10.240]  a dab of it to this polishing cloth? Well, that's usually what they tell you to do,
[13:10.240 --> 13:13.760]  right? Because you don't want to spray it on the thing because then it could drip down inside the—
[13:13.760 --> 13:17.440]  Right. That's what I would guess. But I think they should tell you that,
[13:17.440 --> 13:22.400]  and maybe have like a little—make it one of the little pamphlets instead of just a single-sided
[13:22.400 --> 13:30.240]  card and show an illustration of it, that you would put just a smidge of the alcohol solution
[13:30.240 --> 13:35.120]  on the polishing cloth and then use that to get off the—how do they describe it?
[13:35.120 --> 13:37.920]  Hard to remove smudges. Right.
[13:40.000 --> 13:47.120]  I think they could—for a $19 polishing cloth that is seemingly mainly intended for use on a
[13:47.120 --> 13:52.400]  $5,000 nanotextured display— And then can you wash that thing?
[13:53.200 --> 13:57.680]  Doesn't say. And I thought that too— That's another thing that's always confused me,
[13:57.680 --> 14:01.520]  because I got years and years ago—I mean, I've had this stuff forever, but it's like
[14:02.240 --> 14:06.880]  I got two sets of some sort of cleaning product that's supposed to be safe to use on laptop
[14:06.880 --> 14:12.080]  screens because it doesn't have alcohol in it. Does it come with—is it an orange cloth thing?
[14:12.080 --> 14:19.040]  No, it's green. But again, I got it, you know, during the Boer War. And
[14:20.960 --> 14:25.360]  I've never run out of it because I use it. I just don't end up using it that much. But when I need
[14:25.360 --> 14:30.720]  it, I definitely need it because someone has put a finger on my screen. And it said to make sure
[14:30.720 --> 14:36.880]  to spray it on the cloth. And I think it says you can just throw the cloths in the washing machine,
[14:36.880 --> 14:42.720]  but because they're not suede. They're definitely fabric. I've never done it because I'm still,
[14:42.720 --> 14:46.080]  for some reason, kind of scared. And I've never needed to, but I feel like it's getting to the
[14:46.080 --> 14:51.040]  point where I've probably washed, cleaned the screen off too many times with them. And now I'm
[14:51.040 --> 14:57.360]  just wetting gunk and putting it back on. So I may have to bite the bullet pretty soon and do that.
[14:57.360 --> 15:04.800]  All right. The product I bought before, and I think I bought it from Apple or else somebody
[15:04.800 --> 15:14.960]  told me that it is the brand that Apple themselves use in retail to clean all of the devices they
[15:14.960 --> 15:25.920]  have on display. It's called whoosh, W-H-O-O-S-H, whoosh.com. And you buy it, it comes with a
[15:25.920 --> 15:34.000]  little spray bottle. You can get like a two-pack where one of them is sort of a bigger size and
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.680]  the other one is more like a lipstick size that you could put in a laptop bag. They come with
[15:39.680 --> 15:45.920]  their own cloths. They're orange cloths. They're very distinctive. And the two sides of the cloth
[15:45.920 --> 15:53.280]  have sort of a different texture. One's a little bit softer and fuzzier and the other side is a
[15:53.280 --> 16:02.080]  little smoother, more like a t-shirt, right? Fuzzy side, t-shirt side. And their instructions
[16:02.080 --> 16:07.360]  are pretty... They're much better than Apple's. And they tell you to spray onto the cloth,
[16:07.360 --> 16:15.760]  not the screen. Use one side to wipe the screen and to... I forget exactly how they tell you to
[16:15.760 --> 16:20.080]  do it, but they either tell you to go in circles or... I have to look it up every time I use it.
[16:20.080 --> 16:24.560]  They either tell you to go in circles or tell you to go straight across, but they tell you
[16:24.560 --> 16:30.720]  which way to go. And then to turn the cloth around after that pass and use the other side
[16:30.720 --> 16:38.400]  of the cloth to sort of take a second pass and dry it off. And that the solution is very safe
[16:38.400 --> 16:43.680]  for all... And they tell you, they list all sorts of things that it is safe for. And it would be
[16:43.680 --> 16:49.600]  anything you would care to use it for, plastic and glass and touch screens and that it won't
[16:49.600 --> 16:55.920]  interfere with the oleophobic coating on a phone and you can use it on aluminum and blah, blah,
[16:55.920 --> 17:03.520]  blah. That's what I expect from Apple. I expect painstaking instructions to tell me exactly how
[17:03.520 --> 17:08.240]  to do it. That's the other thing about the Apple cloth. It feels to... As far as I can tell,
[17:08.240 --> 17:15.280]  it's exactly the same on both sides. So anyway, I probably should have just stuck with whoosh.
[17:17.440 --> 17:21.440]  But I got a podcast segment out of it, so maybe it was worth it.
[17:21.440 --> 17:26.560]  Maybe it was worth it. I want to correct myself from earlier because I said they'd never made a
[17:26.560 --> 17:32.960]  14-inch... The iBook G3 was a 14-inch. I was mostly talking about PowerBooks or Pro machines.
[17:32.960 --> 17:37.280]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The iBooks used to come in 12 and 14 inches.
[17:38.720 --> 17:44.320]  No, I think they... But they were square. Or not square, but the aspect ratio was very different.
[17:44.960 --> 17:49.680]  I don't think they made it... Maybe they did make a 12-inch. Yeah, they did.
[17:49.680 --> 17:54.480]  Yeah, they did. Yeah, because I remember, because I had a 12-inch... This is back when I was...
[17:55.200 --> 18:01.680]  I bought a 12-inch for travel. I had the titanium PowerBook, and then I bought...
[18:01.680 --> 18:08.960]  This was before I had a kid. I remember I really wanted the 12-inch PowerBook,
[18:08.960 --> 18:17.840]  but couldn't afford it. And so I got the 12-inch iBook and was not so pleased with it. I didn't
[18:17.840 --> 18:22.000]  like the keys on that. Oh, yeah, they're pretty squishy.
[18:22.000 --> 18:28.880]  They were squishy, and they kind of yellowed quickly. It was one of those products that
[18:28.880 --> 18:34.400]  looked way better in product photography than it did in real life. And I know that some people,
[18:34.400 --> 18:37.520]  you might think, well, everything looks better in professional product photography,
[18:37.520 --> 18:45.120]  but that's not true. There are aspects of the new MacBook Pro that, to me, look better in real life.
[18:45.120 --> 18:50.080]  Like, with nice lighting, it's like, man, this looks even nicer in real life. You just can't
[18:50.080 --> 18:57.040]  even photograph how nice the etching on the bottom of the name MacBook Pro looks. Photographs don't
[18:57.040 --> 19:04.000]  do it. Those 12-inch iBook clear keyboard keycaps, they looked really bad in real life.
[19:04.000 --> 19:09.520]  Yeah. I was like that generation, though, because you could pop the keyboard up, and then
[19:09.520 --> 19:12.880]  you could have access to the RAM and the airport card, I think.
[19:12.880 --> 19:16.640]  Yeah, that was, because I think you had to pay extra for the airport card.
[19:16.640 --> 19:20.800]  Yeah, at the very beginning, at least. I can't remember if they started it,
[19:20.800 --> 19:23.120]  but you might have had to add it on as an option, yeah.
[19:23.120 --> 19:26.800]  Oh, we're getting old, John. Airport cards.
[19:29.440 --> 19:32.560]  All right, let me take a break. Thank our first sponsor. It's Membrful.

[21:10.080 --> 21:12.080]  what the hell just happened? And Moltz will say, this is-
[21:12.080 --> 21:16.640]  Exactly. Yeah, no, that sounds great for me. Also, I will say that it's really great to use.
[21:18.480 --> 21:22.560]  It's been super easy and we wouldn't use anything else, honestly.
[21:22.560 --> 21:27.120]  Everybody I know who uses it swears by it and they don't even really look back. It's great stuff.
[21:28.320 --> 21:32.080]  What's up next on the review schedule? I got to do a whole separate episode
[21:32.080 --> 21:37.600]  on the MacBook Pro. And so for people who go, if you're going through this thinking,
[21:37.600 --> 21:41.760]  well, Gruber's got to talk about the MacBook Pro because the reviews just came out like two days
[21:41.760 --> 21:46.240]  ago and he wrote a long review and everybody's talking about it. They're very interesting
[21:46.240 --> 21:49.920]  machines. And we could talk about them a little, but I got to do a whole show about that.
[21:49.920 --> 21:51.200]  The other product- And I don't have one.
[21:51.200 --> 21:53.520]  And you don't have one. So what the hell are you going to say?
[21:53.520 --> 21:59.200]  And I'm not getting one. I'll just say that right now. I have an M1 MacBook Air and that is perfect
[21:59.200 --> 22:07.200]  for my needs. You should think about some whoosh though. Not a sponsor. Not a sponsor, but should
[22:07.200 --> 22:12.960]  be. Whoosh. Come to me. I guess I'm not allowed. Can you only buy that cloth as an add-on?
[22:14.400 --> 22:18.960]  You know, I think they do sell it separately. Will they even sell me one is my question.
[22:19.600 --> 22:23.200]  I keep wanting to call it the cleaning cloth, but they call it the polishing cloth.
[22:24.480 --> 22:28.880]  It's a polishing cloth. 19 bucks. I'll try to put a link in the show notes.
[22:28.880 --> 22:33.280]  No, but next up is a product I have had, and I hinted at it a segment ago,
[22:33.920 --> 22:39.120]  and have not written about because I've been too busy writing about the MacBook Pro,
[22:40.320 --> 22:44.720]  but the AirPods third generation. Now you do have these.
[22:44.720 --> 22:49.600]  These I do have. This is the one thing that I bought from last week's announcements.
[22:49.600 --> 22:50.640]  I'm curious what you think.
[22:51.600 --> 22:55.280]  I like them. I had the first generation and the second generation. I've never had the
[22:55.280 --> 23:00.880]  pros before, so this has some of the features of the pros that I'm really kind of enjoying.
[23:00.880 --> 23:06.560]  They are larger in my ears, which is interesting. I wasn't really even expecting that. I knew that
[23:06.560 --> 23:11.120]  they would be shorter, but I didn't know that they were sort of physically larger in the
[23:12.320 --> 23:17.040]  ear area. And so far so good. I was kind of wondering if that would,
[23:17.040 --> 23:22.480]  you know, make my ears ache after a little while, but I wore them for a significant amount of time
[23:22.480 --> 23:28.880]  today and it seemed basically fine. So that was good. And I really like the clicky thing.
[23:28.880 --> 23:35.840]  I mean, that took me a little while to figure out. I think, you know, they always pop up those
[23:35.840 --> 23:40.400]  things that say, do you want to learn more about your device or your new software or
[23:40.400 --> 23:44.160]  whatever it is? And I have a tendency to dismiss them and then I can never find them again.
[23:44.720 --> 23:48.880]  Of course, of course, there is an app, right? I think there's like, there's an app someplace
[23:48.880 --> 23:54.800]  where that shows up and I never, I can never find it. I'm sure that happened and I clicked past it
[23:54.800 --> 23:58.560]  just to get to the point where I could actually start listening to things and then was like,
[23:58.560 --> 24:05.200]  Oh, how do I advance songs and stuff like that? I did. I did eventually circle back and figure
[24:05.200 --> 24:09.680]  that out. I do the same thing where I'm like, well, look, I'm an expert, you know, have you
[24:09.680 --> 24:14.320]  heard of, have you heard of during Fireball? I saw the presentation. I should know how those
[24:14.320 --> 24:20.800]  works, but I forgot. I watched the presentation live with a notebook taking copious notes of
[24:20.800 --> 24:26.000]  everything they said, why in the world would I need to do this? And it turns out that they go
[24:26.000 --> 24:31.760]  pretty fast and you don't remember everything they say, and you end up not knowing how to pause.
[24:31.760 --> 24:44.080]  So I have, I own a pair of the AirPods Pro and I love them and prefer them, preferred them
[24:44.080 --> 24:52.480]  instantly over my regular older AirPods. And is that for functionality or fit?
[24:52.480 --> 24:58.800]  It was every, for me, it was every single thing about them. I enjoyed the fit once I got used to
[24:58.800 --> 25:06.960]  it. And I, to me, the big fundamental difference is, well, at a feature level, it's the noise
[25:06.960 --> 25:11.760]  cancellation that the AirPods Pro have and the regular AirPods don't, but I don't think it's
[25:11.760 --> 25:19.600]  possible to do the noise cancellation without the sealed style of buds. And the seal...
[25:19.600 --> 25:21.600]  Well, unless it's over the ear, yeah.
[25:21.600 --> 25:26.960]  Right, right. But if you're talking about AirPod buds or any kind of bud type
[25:26.960 --> 25:35.120]  size thing, it's either sealed or not sealed. Years ago, I mean, again, to go down memory lane,
[25:35.120 --> 25:40.880]  I got a pair of Shure earbuds with noise cancellation. I may have talked to you about
[25:40.880 --> 25:49.600]  that on this show. It was a gift in the gift bag from Mac World Expo. And it was one of those
[25:49.600 --> 25:55.040]  things, it might've been the first year that I was a speaker at Mac World Expo. I'd always heard
[25:55.040 --> 26:00.640]  that at the Oscars, for example, they give people these gift bags with absurdly expensive gifts in
[26:00.640 --> 26:07.440]  them. I didn't know, I had no idea that Mac World Expo gave me anything. All I thought was, well,
[26:07.440 --> 26:13.520]  I get a free pass and I should... Speaking to the Mac World audience would be good for
[26:13.520 --> 26:20.080]  my professional stature, for lack of a better word. This is something I should do. And I go
[26:20.080 --> 26:24.160]  there and I register for the pass, they give me this bag full of stuff. And I'm like, what the
[26:24.160 --> 26:30.160]  hell? And I start looking through it. And I was ready to ditch it all. And there's like a backpack
[26:30.160 --> 26:35.120]  and it's like, well, I don't even have room to go home with this huge backpack. But I found this
[26:35.120 --> 26:40.480]  Shure headphones and I was like, sure, that's a good brand. And I looked it up and they were like
[26:40.480 --> 26:48.080]  $400 earbuds. I was like, I would never spend $400 on these things. But they were noise canceling
[26:48.080 --> 26:55.440]  and had the seal. And similar to AirPods, when you open it up, there were four different style
[26:55.440 --> 27:00.960]  of rubber tips that you were encouraged to, if you find the default ones uncomfortable,
[27:01.600 --> 27:09.600]  try these larger and smaller and a differently shaped mushroom end that you would squeeze in
[27:09.600 --> 27:16.800]  your ear canal. And I used those for years and years on airplanes because the noise canceling
[27:16.800 --> 27:24.240]  is great on airplanes. And for me, the earbuds that go in your ear are way more comfortable for
[27:24.240 --> 27:30.000]  like a five hour flight than over the ear type things that make my ears sweat.
[27:30.000 --> 27:35.840]  I have the opposite experience personally. I've never had success with those things that go in
[27:35.840 --> 27:41.680]  your ear canal. And I think Paul and other people have suggested getting the foam tips because you
[27:41.680 --> 27:48.640]  can get third party foam tips right for the AirPods. I have not tried that, but I certainly
[27:48.640 --> 27:53.280]  haven't tried it with AirPods Pro because I don't have it. But I don't have AirPods Pro because
[27:53.280 --> 27:58.400]  those things have never really worked for me. That's a friend of the show, a friend of the
[27:58.400 --> 28:03.840]  family, Paul Kvostas of Rogue Amoeba fame. Yeah, there's like a whole cottage industry in
[28:03.840 --> 28:11.040]  the third party foam style tips for AirPods. Like that's one of the nice things about Apple
[28:11.040 --> 28:18.560]  getting popular and having so few products that they only make like three styles of AirPods and
[28:18.560 --> 28:23.200]  only one of them takes tips. I don't know if you heard, they were only repeated it about seven
[28:23.200 --> 28:29.440]  times last week in the keynote. They're the best selling headphones in the world. So it makes sense
[28:29.440 --> 28:36.960]  that there'd be this whole cottage industry of $10, $5, $7 foam tips that you can buy from
[28:36.960 --> 28:43.440]  Amazon. I bought the other day from Amazon. This is a total tangent, but I feel like it's the same
[28:43.440 --> 28:53.440]  way with the foam tips. I am always losing the SIM card popper routers. You know what I mean?
[28:53.440 --> 29:01.840]  Whatever you call it. Even though I get more of them sent to me by Apple than just about anybody
[29:01.840 --> 29:10.320]  because I buy new iPhones every year for me and the wife. I always buy them now with the idea
[29:10.320 --> 29:14.720]  that we're just going to swap the SIM card from our old phones into new phones because that always
[29:14.720 --> 29:20.640]  works better for me. We've had so many problems over the years when you transfer your line over
[29:20.640 --> 29:26.400]  and Verizon system doesn't even know what phone you bought. We just pop the SIM out. When you
[29:26.400 --> 29:32.240]  buy a phone that isn't already on Verizon or AT&T or T-Mobile, they send you an iPhone that comes
[29:32.240 --> 29:39.680]  with an Apple SIM card popper router and they're so tiny and I lose them. But in review season,
[29:39.680 --> 29:46.400]  I'm popping SIMs out of phones all the time. It's like I work at a phone store because I'm like,
[29:46.400 --> 29:54.240]  I should go back to my old phone, my new phone, four review phones, and if I want to test
[29:54.240 --> 30:00.480]  something on the iPhone 13 mini and it's like, well, if I'm going to use it for a day, I should
[30:00.480 --> 30:05.360]  put my SIM in it and I can't find the damn SIM popper routers. So I went and looked on Amazon
[30:05.360 --> 30:10.240]  to see if there was one. I was like, they should make a big one that I wouldn't lose. More like
[30:10.240 --> 30:17.280]  a pen. You know what I mean? With a tip. You can always attach a giant brush to it or something
[30:17.280 --> 30:24.320]  like they do it for the key at a rest stop. I have tried putting them on a ring and I have
[30:24.320 --> 30:30.400]  kept that one, the one I put on like a key ring. But I just popped into my head to look on Amazon
[30:30.400 --> 30:36.240]  and of course there's a gazillion of them and they are insanely cheap. But the one that I picked,
[30:37.200 --> 30:44.480]  I swear to God, it was like four bucks, free Prime shipping, two day, three day, whatever.
[30:44.480 --> 30:52.640]  But it included like 10 other styles of SIM card popper, like two of these ones that look like a
[30:52.640 --> 31:00.320]  little tool, almost like a golf pencil size with a SIM popper on the end. But they also had a bunch
[31:00.320 --> 31:05.520]  of the ones that are more like paperclips, more like the ones Apple includes. But...
[31:06.480 --> 31:11.040]  I mean, isn't the tip the same on all of them? They're just different handles?
[31:11.040 --> 31:12.720]  Yeah, just different handles.
[31:12.720 --> 31:17.360]  Wow. Hold on, hold on. I got it. You got to see it again.
[31:17.360 --> 31:22.240]  I have a little box on my desk and every time I get a new iPhone, I pull that thing out and
[31:22.240 --> 31:28.720]  I put it in the box on my desk. And I'll lose a few over the years, but usually there's at least
[31:28.720 --> 31:34.400]  two in there at any given time. Here we go. I'm sending you a link.
[31:34.400 --> 31:43.280]  Oh my God. Are these repurposed dental tools or something?
[31:44.800 --> 31:52.080]  It is. It is the A-Y-W-F-E-Y. I don't know what if you see...
[31:53.600 --> 32:00.320]  So this is $7 and it's 16 different SIM card poppers. And they're all, you know,
[32:00.320 --> 32:06.720]  the tip's the same on all of them. That's wild. Of the 16 SIM popper routers, four of them
[32:06.720 --> 32:13.760]  basically look like Apples. Two of them are the little golf pencil style ones that I was...
[32:13.760 --> 32:17.120]  the whole reason I bought the damn thing. And I would have bought it just to get... I would have
[32:17.120 --> 32:21.520]  paid seven bucks for like one of them, but you know, why not pay seven bucks to get two of the
[32:21.520 --> 32:27.440]  ones I wanted? But then there's two each of a variety of other styles.
[32:27.440 --> 32:31.520]  Yeah. Some of them look like guitar picks.
[32:31.520 --> 32:37.280]  Yes. Yes. The guitar picks. Well, there's like a solid guitar pick, a hollow guitar pick.
[32:39.760 --> 32:40.800]  I don't know. I mean...
[32:40.800 --> 32:47.120]  Some ellipses, two ellipses, two T-shaped ones that are hollow, hollowed out T's,
[32:47.120 --> 32:51.760]  and then the things that look like the sliders you put it over your laptop camera.
[32:51.760 --> 32:57.280]  Anyway, it's like if you're dissatisfied with your SIM card popper router lifestyle...
[32:57.280 --> 32:58.400]  Or you can't find it.
[32:58.400 --> 33:06.400]  Yeah. You're five or six bucks away from anything you want. And I feel the same way with the foam
[33:06.400 --> 33:12.400]  tips for AirPods. You can find replacements if you like foam instead of rubber. But the big
[33:12.400 --> 33:17.040]  fundamental problem with the whole concept is there are a lot of people who do not like
[33:17.040 --> 33:21.840]  anything sealed in their ear canal, whether it's a physical thing...
[33:21.840 --> 33:26.800]  Well, for me, it's not the comfort of it, per se. It's the fact that they just keep sliding out,
[33:26.800 --> 33:31.440]  and then it doesn't work right anymore, particularly for the noise cancellation.
[33:32.320 --> 33:36.480]  I might be misremembering, but my friend, our friend, everybody's friend, Ben Thompson,
[33:36.480 --> 33:44.000]  who I did the other show with, he just cannot stand it, right? It just is a non-starter for
[33:44.000 --> 33:52.640]  him to have a sealed ear canal. So as a year-long or two years-long, I don't know how long the
[33:52.640 --> 33:58.880]  AirPods Pro came out, probably two years ago. As a long-time AirPods Pro user, using the new
[33:58.880 --> 34:06.400]  third-generation AirPods for a week was very familiar because everything about them works
[34:06.400 --> 34:11.280]  like the AirPods Pro, where you have a little clicky thing on each earbud that you can do
[34:11.280 --> 34:14.880]  things. You know you can go into settings, too, and change it so that left and right do different
[34:14.880 --> 34:22.400]  things. Well, yeah, that I knew from previous AirPods. And ever since I've been using them,
[34:22.400 --> 34:29.840]  the old style of AirPod controls, where you tap your ear, seems so crude and primitive.
[34:29.840 --> 34:36.240]  Yeah, yeah. And it was impossible to go back. And I never liked that. I never really liked it,
[34:36.240 --> 34:40.720]  because it always felt like I was pushing it, you know, like tapping my ear, which for me,
[34:40.720 --> 34:48.480]  which felt like an unnatural thing to do. Right. It was like the AirPods equivalent of
[34:48.480 --> 34:54.880]  shake to undo on the iPhone, where it just felt like if you deleted text, you didn't mean to
[34:54.880 --> 35:00.720]  delete. Shaking your iPhone like you're getting ready to pop open some champagne because you just
[35:00.720 --> 35:08.160]  won a championship, it just felt so stupid. It honestly feels like, not to be crude, a rude hand
[35:08.160 --> 35:18.160]  gesture. Just a gesture you might not make in front of children. Yes. And that's how you undo
[35:18.160 --> 35:22.480]  tapping your ear. It's like, imagine if like, you know, there was a feature where
[35:22.480 --> 35:29.120]  if you banged your head against the trackpad, it's, you know, you entered full screen mode,
[35:29.120 --> 35:33.680]  like everything reboots. Yeah. But if you want to move if you want to enter full screen mode
[35:33.680 --> 35:40.640]  on Mac OS X, just bang your head against the trackpad. You don't have to bang it hard. But
[35:40.640 --> 35:46.320]  it still would feel like, why am I doing this? Why am I banging my AirPods? And the other thing
[35:46.320 --> 35:51.920]  in hindsight, once you never have to tap your AirPods again to do anything, you realize how
[35:51.920 --> 35:57.280]  it always felt to me like you were also risking popping the AirPod out, that you would tap it,
[35:57.280 --> 36:05.840]  and it would like rebound and pop out of your ear. I find spending a week with these AirPod
[36:05.840 --> 36:09.840]  third generation ones, the thing for me is that I'm so used to the
[36:09.840 --> 36:15.040]  sealed ear canal that they constantly felt like they were on the cusp of falling out.
[36:15.040 --> 36:19.760]  No, really. But yeah, I mean, I think that all and a lot of that just depends on people's
[36:19.760 --> 36:24.960]  people have different ears. And I think I have just gotten to the point where I that's the only
[36:24.960 --> 36:32.480]  way I can explain it. And some people like the ear canal ones and other people like the other kind.
[36:32.480 --> 36:40.240]  And my ear, my ears are meant to use the this particular kind. And I've never really had like,
[36:40.240 --> 36:45.520]  if I'm taking a shirt off over my head, yeah, then the AirPods will come out. But other than that,
[36:45.520 --> 36:52.720]  I've run in them, I, you know, one wearing them. And I've never had one just fall out
[36:52.720 --> 36:57.520]  accidentally like that, right? And where I wear them in the winter with a winter hat hat that
[36:57.520 --> 37:01.920]  might, you know, covers my ears, keep my ears warm, they don't, they don't fall out. I've never
[37:01.920 --> 37:06.640]  really had a problem with AirPods falling out. But it was just an uncanny feeling because I had been
[37:06.640 --> 37:11.520]  so used to the sealed thing. But as a product, that's I don't think that's a problem at all.
[37:11.520 --> 37:21.040]  I'm clearly as a person in on team sealed ear canal. And anybody who's not either doesn't own
[37:21.040 --> 37:27.520]  AirPods Pro because they know it or they gave them away or sold them or returned them to Apple
[37:27.520 --> 37:32.720]  or something because they found them unpleasant. Right. So anybody who's already got AirPods Pro
[37:33.280 --> 37:39.120]  is and is happy with them is definitely not in the market for the regular AirPod third generation.
[37:40.640 --> 37:48.240]  Yeah. What else? It's nice. It's nice that they have unified on the MagSafe slash
[37:48.240 --> 37:53.440]  Qi charging cases and that they don't upsell you on those. Yeah. So this is my first that's
[37:53.440 --> 37:57.200]  actually Qi charging because when I got the second generation ones, I just stuck with the
[37:57.200 --> 38:04.720]  lightning charging. And so that's been nice too. And I don't have an extra MagSafe connector
[38:04.720 --> 38:09.280]  lying around anywhere. So I but I do did have I mean, I've got plenty of Qi chargers lying around.
[38:09.280 --> 38:14.000]  So I was able to just put a Qi charger on my nightstand. And so now I go to bed, I just put
[38:14.000 --> 38:18.000]  the case on the Qi charger. It would be cool. I mean, I tried it on the MagSafe one that I put
[38:18.000 --> 38:24.560]  my iPhone on. And that was just hanging there in midair was kind of cool. But I'm not gonna run out
[38:24.560 --> 38:30.640]  and buy another MagSafe charger just to do that probably. I actually find that for charging,
[38:30.640 --> 38:37.040]  it's it's my What do I have that charges by Qi? I have phones and I think that I think that's it.
[38:37.040 --> 38:44.640]  Then the only things I have are my AirPod cases and the the phones. I like it better for AirPods
[38:44.640 --> 38:49.840]  than the phone because I don't really need the AirPods. The problem with AirPods is that they
[38:50.960 --> 38:57.680]  the batteries last so long, especially for the case, that it was easy when I first got them
[38:57.680 --> 39:04.080]  when there was no MagSafe for Qi charging case. It was easy to forget about it for a week. And then
[39:04.080 --> 39:09.920]  you do get the that sad little bloop bloop. And you're like, Oh, oh, I guess this is the batteries
[39:09.920 --> 39:15.760]  finally did run out. Whereas now it is so easy to be completely lazy and just put them on a
[39:15.760 --> 39:21.360]  Qi charger on your bedside or on your desk. And it's it's like the for me, the case never even
[39:21.360 --> 39:28.080]  gets close to 50%. Because I've just I just and then it's also a nice way. It's like having a
[39:28.080 --> 39:32.320]  little box for your keys. So you never lose your keys when you come home because you always put
[39:32.320 --> 39:38.160]  them in the same place. It's like I actually stopped losing my AirPod cases or misplugging
[39:38.160 --> 39:42.160]  it or not losing losing but misplacing where the hell they leave them because I just tend to leave
[39:42.160 --> 39:51.040]  it on like the Qi charger on my desk or on my my my bedside. Yeah. What else? Yeah, I mean, it's
[39:51.040 --> 40:00.160]  always nice to take away those failure points. Have you tried the new find my stuff? No, I have
[40:00.160 --> 40:08.960]  not yet. That's see, that's sort of the the direct consequence of the previous I don't I used to
[40:08.960 --> 40:15.680]  misplace my AirPods more frequently before Qi charging than I do now because I just tend to know
[40:15.680 --> 40:19.200]  the couple of places around the house where I have a charging pad. And that's where my AirPods
[40:19.200 --> 40:26.480]  tend to be. But I tried it out. It's it's pretty cool. It's they don't have what are they called
[40:26.480 --> 40:32.640]  the the location chip? Mm hmm. What's that called? I forget which number it is. Yeah,
[40:32.640 --> 40:40.480]  but whatever that chip is that let's let's find my do remarkably accurate location of of a device.
[40:42.560 --> 40:49.120]  But they it's fine. Like it it it it was like I pretended I left them in my bedroom. You know,
[40:49.840 --> 40:54.800]  I knew they were in my bedroom, but I was testing out the find my and it got me closer took took
[40:54.800 --> 40:59.360]  longer. It was like looking for a signal. This might take a while. Wait, wait, wait. It was
[40:59.360 --> 41:03.920]  certainly better than not having it and it definitely worked. And yeah, the phone got
[41:03.920 --> 41:10.320]  very excited like a like a dog when you come home. It got very excited when it got near the AirPods.
[41:13.360 --> 41:19.280]  It was like I've got it. Yeah, I don't lose mine. I mean, I saw you know, that little coin pocket
[41:19.280 --> 41:24.880]  or whatever it is in jeans. I mean, I'm always wearing jeans and and I actually the even the
[41:24.880 --> 41:30.960]  khakis that I have have the same pocket but in just a different spot. I I stick my AirPods in
[41:30.960 --> 41:35.680]  there. And so the case is always in there during the day. And I know where it is. And and you know,
[41:35.680 --> 41:40.960]  I put the put the AirPods AirPods in and then I put the case back in my pocket. And then at night
[41:40.960 --> 41:44.240]  I take it out of the pocket and put it in the charging stand. Yeah, I don't so I don't lose
[41:44.240 --> 41:49.120]  them often. But it's you know, it's nice to have if you do. Yeah, you know, yeah. Yeah. I mean, Karen
[41:49.120 --> 41:54.960]  loses all the time because you know, women's clothes don't have pockets. She's at an unfair
[41:54.960 --> 42:01.680]  disadvantage. We laugh but it's it is true. It's true. Or they or they have pockets that it just
[42:02.320 --> 42:08.000]  don't even you know, don't even fit in AirPods case and it's you know, not quite sure. Or don't
[42:08.000 --> 42:14.960]  hold things in very well. Right. Right. So yeah, it's it's nice to have. I think aesthetically,
[42:14.960 --> 42:21.200]  I've never I never bought into the people look silly wearing AirPods thing. I was thinking about
[42:21.200 --> 42:25.920]  that before we recorded that. Remember when AirPods were new five years ago, that was like
[42:25.920 --> 42:31.360]  a big thing. Like people look so stupid with AirPods. I never I never quite got that it felt
[42:31.360 --> 42:36.400]  weird to me wearing them. But I didn't think other people looked stupid wearing them because
[42:36.400 --> 42:44.080]  they looked exactly like wired earbuds that people had been using for, you know, at least from Apple
[42:44.080 --> 42:52.400]  for like 20 years, just without the wires. So how if if you look, if you don't look stupid wearing
[42:52.400 --> 43:00.240]  the same size or almost exactly the same size white buds in your ear with a white cable streaming
[43:00.240 --> 43:05.680]  out of both of them. How do you look stupid if you just cut the cables off? I never got it but
[43:05.680 --> 43:12.720]  some people thought people looked weird. Yeah. But I do think the newer look initiated by the
[43:12.720 --> 43:18.880]  pros and now followed by the new third generation regular AirPods where the stem is shorter. I think
[43:18.880 --> 43:23.600]  it does look better. I think it does too. Yeah, I would still like if there was a color option,
[43:23.600 --> 43:28.000]  I'd probably go with a different color than white, but they're fine. I mean, they're better now.
[43:29.760 --> 43:34.000]  The first day the first time I was I know that was exactly the first one of the first few times
[43:34.000 --> 43:39.280]  I wore AirPods outside of the house was he was walking the dog or something and this guy stopped
[43:39.280 --> 43:42.640]  me saying, Oh, you got those AirPods, huh? I was like, Yeah, he's like, How do you like them?
[43:43.280 --> 43:45.520]  I love them. I think they're great. And he's like, they look ridiculous.
[43:48.640 --> 43:55.680]  He said, Okay, but but they're really good. My friend, Dave Whiskas, who I did the Vesper app
[43:55.680 --> 44:00.160]  with, he bought them right away and said, I'm not going to return them. I'm going to use them
[44:00.160 --> 44:06.560]  because I love using them. But I feel like I look stupid with them. And that he'd, you know,
[44:06.560 --> 44:11.760]  he'd be walking down the street and see somebody else with AirPods and think, boy, they look stupid
[44:11.760 --> 44:17.040]  and then realize I've got them in right now. And he said he just constantly felt self conscious
[44:17.040 --> 44:24.880]  about it. But it must be true. I don't really remember. I remember when the Sony Walkman was new
[44:24.880 --> 44:28.960]  and desperately wanted one. And of course, you know, they were very expensive. It was like the
[44:28.960 --> 44:35.440]  the iPod of its day. And it was a while it took a couple just a handful of years for like,
[44:36.400 --> 44:44.080]  Walkman sized, personal cassette players to get down to the price where somebody, you know,
[44:44.080 --> 44:49.360]  my parents would buy them for me as a then whatever 10 11 year old, but I'll bet that
[44:50.080 --> 44:54.800]  I'll bet that there was that sort of reaction to them at that time when people you know,
[44:54.800 --> 45:01.520]  like all of a sudden, yeah, people are on the New York City subway and they've got a Sony Walkman.
[45:01.520 --> 45:05.280]  And it's like, look at that idiot. He's got like two orange Nerf balls on his ears.
[45:07.120 --> 45:10.000]  Right. And yeah, I mean, people are always gonna make, you know,
[45:10.720 --> 45:13.520]  anytime there's something new, there's gonna be a bunch of people that make fun of it.
[45:13.520 --> 45:18.960]  But they're but like Walkman style, the initial Walkman style headphones, the ones you know,
[45:18.960 --> 45:22.480]  you mean when they had Nerf, like Nerf balls? Yeah, on the end, right?
[45:22.480 --> 45:25.760]  Well, yeah, I mean, I don't remember there being other kind of like either
[45:25.760 --> 45:28.800]  all the headphones that I had prior that were over the ear. Yeah.
[45:29.600 --> 45:34.000]  Types and then those were on here. They were way more.
[45:37.600 --> 45:43.840]  Even without making an aesthetic judgment, they were certainly more obvious, right? You know,
[45:43.840 --> 45:49.200]  they're far from subtle. You had like a headband over the top of your head and orange foam,
[45:49.200 --> 45:52.880]  you know, and eventually they made other colors other than orange. But there must
[45:52.880 --> 45:57.760]  have been that type of reaction to that too, by people who are not the early adopter mindset,
[45:57.760 --> 46:01.280]  who is like, I don't know, I'm a little bored right now. And I might be,
[46:01.280 --> 46:04.720]  I might enjoy listening to music, but I'm not going to look stupid with those.
[46:07.600 --> 46:13.040]  I know, we had one and I don't, I don't remember that. But of course, you know,
[46:13.040 --> 46:17.600]  we were kids when we got it. And it was, you know, like, if you were in high school or
[46:17.600 --> 46:23.440]  something like in our junior high school, none of the kids were gonna think that because they
[46:23.440 --> 46:26.160]  were like, Oh, my God, you gotta walk, man. Right. You can listen to music.
[46:30.080 --> 46:33.440]  Walking down the hall. They should have had podcasts back then. You just
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.320]  mail them out. We could have just, just mail them out on cassette tapes.
[46:39.280 --> 46:42.800]  Isn't that what AM radio was? Yeah. And you could just, you know, and you could just,
[46:42.800 --> 46:45.920]  you know, and encourage people, you know, it'd be sort of like the Grateful Dead,
[46:45.920 --> 46:49.040]  where you would encourage people to make copies for your friends, you know.
[46:50.960 --> 46:57.040]  If you've got a copy of episode, you know, whatever of the talk show from 1986, then,
[46:57.040 --> 47:02.000]  you know, make as many copies as you want. It's, you know, hand them out to your local Mac user
[47:02.000 --> 47:08.640]  group. I remember trying to tape songs off the radio by just putting a tape recorder up to the
[47:08.640 --> 47:14.960]  speaker because they had no other way of getting off the radio. Oh, man, that was, Amy and I talk
[47:14.960 --> 47:19.920]  about it all the time. That was a feature of the boomboxes of the era. Those big panels, those
[47:19.920 --> 47:28.800]  Panasonic silver plastic boomboxes where they had both a tape player and a radio. If you hit record
[47:28.800 --> 47:34.000]  while the radio was playing, it would record the radio to the tape directly, you know, without any
[47:34.000 --> 47:38.800]  kind of, and that was easy. So you get the song you want without the first, like, five seconds.
[47:38.800 --> 47:42.720]  You'd get it without the first five seconds. Sometimes they would tell you,
[47:42.720 --> 47:47.760]  like, the disc jockey would say, hey, stick around. We're going to take a break. But when
[47:47.760 --> 47:52.720]  we come back, we've got the new Cyndi Lauper. And you'd be like, ah, that's one of them I've
[47:52.720 --> 47:58.560]  been waiting for. I've been waiting to get a, girls just want to have fun. And so you'd have
[47:58.560 --> 48:04.000]  your finger on it ready to go when he came back. But then it's like, a lot of times they would
[48:04.000 --> 48:09.840]  start the song and the stupid disc jockey would keep talking about the weather or whatever,
[48:09.840 --> 48:14.080]  you know, and telling you, you know, we'll have a traffic break in 20 seconds. Shut up,
[48:14.080 --> 48:22.080]  the song started, you know. But it was a way you could collect music at a, you know,
[48:22.080 --> 48:27.280]  what was then a very high quality, quote unquote, for free. Actually, it never even occurred to me
[48:27.280 --> 48:32.320]  that it might be illegal. I actually didn't even think of that as, I did not at the time,
[48:32.320 --> 48:37.360]  I didn't think of it as piracy. It's, I'm not sure what recording off the radio. Yeah, I mean,
[48:37.360 --> 48:40.880]  I didn't didn't occur to me. Of course, you know, I mean, like, I wasn't, I was what, you know,
[48:40.880 --> 48:44.960]  12. I wasn't looking into it. If I could do it, I would do it.
[48:44.960 --> 48:49.760]  Like, I think everybody knew, like, once mp3s became a thing that if you were downloading
[48:49.760 --> 48:55.280]  songs from, you know, Napster, you knew you were technically breaking the law, like you
[48:55.280 --> 48:59.760]  Well, and I think they had these things, they had these things in certain cities here, too. But when
[48:59.760 --> 49:04.240]  I went to Japan, my junior year in college, they had right next to the university where I was,
[49:04.240 --> 49:11.040]  they had a place where you could rent records. So you'd go in and rent a record and then take
[49:11.040 --> 49:16.640]  it home and tape it and then return the record. Which obviously, you know, I mean, that's what
[49:16.640 --> 49:22.480]  everybody was doing. And I was always sort of surprised by that. Like, like, is this this is
[49:22.480 --> 49:27.600]  okay. I was like, yeah, that's what they what they do here. So yeah, so I did it. I did it as
[49:27.600 --> 49:33.200]  much as I possibly could while I was there. And it would also put it in a way more like binary.
[49:33.200 --> 49:37.840]  Is it portable or not portable? Right? Like no, nobody had a record player in their car.
[49:38.480 --> 49:43.440]  Yeah, I don't think I don't know. I bet I bet there were I bet there were I think I've seen
[49:43.440 --> 49:47.760]  that there was there were some definitely some crazy cars in the 60s. But they had turntables.
[49:47.760 --> 49:52.960]  But can you imagine driving around with a turntable? How slow you would have to drive
[49:52.960 --> 49:58.240]  that work? Yeah. You would have to go so slow to keep it from skipping.
[49:58.240 --> 50:05.840]  You mentioned the colors. I that's an interesting thing that I spending a week with another new set
[50:05.840 --> 50:17.040]  of AirPods and thinking about it. And I'm it is very curious. So they make the AirPods max,
[50:17.040 --> 50:24.800]  the big over the ear ones in a variety of colors. But the regular AirPods they've never
[50:24.800 --> 50:31.120]  made in any color other than white. And that goes back all the way to when they were just AirPods,
[50:31.120 --> 50:38.640]  you know, with wires. Yeah. Why Why do you think that is? I don't know. I mean,
[50:38.640 --> 50:44.800]  it might just be a branding thing in order for but I guess so like with the with the over the
[50:44.800 --> 50:53.920]  ear ones. They're obviously Apple, right? There's a logo on them. Is there? I don't think there is.
[50:53.920 --> 50:58.880]  I think that they count on them being a sort of iconic shape. I don't think there's a logo. Maybe
[50:58.880 --> 51:05.120]  the logos inside the ear cup. It's in the mesh on the inside of the ear cup. Well, and I mean,
[51:05.120 --> 51:11.840]  and I guess like if you know what they the difference between expensive earbuds,
[51:11.840 --> 51:16.000]  you wouldn't, you know, headphones, you would know that those are AirPods max, but I don't think most
[51:16.000 --> 51:22.480]  people would. I so so then that takes away my thesis, which is basically that it was a branding
[51:22.480 --> 51:27.680]  concept because I don't I maybe it still is. I mean, maybe the white still is like they want
[51:27.680 --> 51:31.840]  people they want other people to know that you're using Apple products. I guess. Yeah,
[51:31.840 --> 51:36.160]  I think it's a I think it fundamentally is a branding thing. And that's why I think Apple,
[51:36.160 --> 51:39.600]  you're never going to get them to explain it. But I think it's a branding thing. I mean,
[51:39.600 --> 51:45.200]  Apple, you're never going to get them to explain it. Like if, you know, I could ask Jaws about it
[51:45.200 --> 51:50.480]  in an on stage interview, and he's not going to say I'm not he's not going to get rude and say,
[51:50.480 --> 51:55.840]  Well, if you I'm not going to answer that. But he's going to talk around it. You know, he's he's
[51:55.840 --> 52:01.200]  not going to give a straightforward answer because they don't explain branding decisions externally
[52:01.200 --> 52:08.480]  ever. But I think that the branding explanation would be AirPods max are an iconic shape.
[52:08.480 --> 52:14.720]  And therefore they can make them in any colors they want. And they're just
[52:14.720 --> 52:18.720]  I don't think most I don't think most people know what AirPods max look like, though. Yeah,
[52:18.720 --> 52:24.160]  most people probably don't. But people who might be in the market for them do. Right. Right. Yes.
[52:24.160 --> 52:31.680]  And with the regular AirPods and ear pods going all the way back to the iPod, you know, and they
[52:31.680 --> 52:36.960]  made that they started making iPods in various colors very quickly, right? You know, we're just
[52:36.960 --> 52:43.840]  celebrated the the 20th anniversary of the original iPod last week, it didn't take line,
[52:43.840 --> 52:50.320]  you know, you could have it in a color you wanted if it was white. It didn't take long for them to
[52:50.320 --> 52:58.480]  get to the iPod mini, and then the iPod nano, which always came in a variety of very fun,
[52:59.120 --> 53:04.720]  anodized aluminum colors. But they always shipped you could buy a red one or a blue one or a green
[53:04.720 --> 53:13.280]  one. And it came with white AirPods. And I think that the branding logic of it is we're going to
[53:13.280 --> 53:20.880]  own this one color. It's the it's the one new it's it's the neutral color for distinctive earbuds.
[53:20.880 --> 53:27.280]  Black would be the other option for something neutral, but a wouldn't have gone with the
[53:27.280 --> 53:39.200]  original iPod. And B just isn't appley, right? Like, there's something like Sony stuff would
[53:40.640 --> 53:46.560]  as often been black, right? Like if you think back to any Sony home equipment, you've had
[53:46.560 --> 53:56.480]  PlayStations are black. We had a Sony DVD player or Blu ray player. For years, I had a Sony receiver,
[53:56.480 --> 54:03.040]  they were always black. That was just the Sony look. It's sort of a serious. You know,
[54:03.040 --> 54:07.840]  I don't know, it can it connotes a different feeling than white. I give it'd be weird. Like
[54:07.840 --> 54:15.200]  if you if you were back in, let's say, 2004, and you were buying a Blu ray player DVD player,
[54:15.200 --> 54:20.400]  if Sony made one, and it was the whole thing, it was meant to go underneath your TV, it would be
[54:20.400 --> 54:25.120]  weird if it was white, it just wouldn't feel like a Sony product. Although I guess I guess now they
[54:25.120 --> 54:30.400]  do at the PS five is white. Yeah, you know, I think they've had certain color options for
[54:30.400 --> 54:33.600]  different I mean, certainly in like mobile players and things like that.
[54:34.480 --> 54:38.880]  With Apple, I feel like with the AirPods, black earbuds would have never looked distinctive,
[54:38.880 --> 54:43.280]  because so many earbuds were already black, right? If you just go into the store and say,
[54:43.280 --> 54:47.920]  Hey, I need a pair of your, you know, I'm in the airport, I need headphones, what color are they?
[54:47.920 --> 54:51.120]  They're almost certainly black, the free ones when you were you're on an airplane,
[54:51.120 --> 54:55.760]  and they give you earbuds to use in the entertainment console. I don't even know if
[54:55.760 --> 55:01.680]  they do that anymore. I mean, who needs who needs their stuff for that. But if you do,
[55:01.680 --> 55:06.400]  I guarantee you they're black. So black didn't make sense as the Apple's default color white,
[55:06.400 --> 55:11.360]  therefore it was. And then once they became a popular thing, I mean, they remember they ran
[55:11.360 --> 55:16.240]  those ad campaigns where they were just like silhouettes of people. And all you would see
[55:16.240 --> 55:22.240]  are white earbuds coming out and a cable coming out and they didn't even have to show the the
[55:22.240 --> 55:28.800]  iPod. People just knew that's that's for Apple's iPod. And I just feel like they feel like that's
[55:28.800 --> 55:36.160]  a thing that they own and that, sure, they can't stop other companies like Samsung or whoever else
[55:36.160 --> 55:43.840]  from making white earbuds. And of course, many other companies do now. But they I feel like they
[55:43.840 --> 55:48.640]  I feel like they feel like they know and everybody else knows they're ripping us off.
[55:50.480 --> 55:55.120]  Yeah, I assume I yeah, I haven't looked I mean, I'm looking at the the ones that Microsoft makes
[55:55.120 --> 56:00.000]  and the ones that Google makes. I'm sure there are ones that Samsung makes that look almost
[56:00.000 --> 56:05.760]  exactly like yeah, AirPods. But the the Google ones and the Microsoft ones look different,
[56:05.760 --> 56:10.000]  or at least different right off. And the Google ones are white. But I don't think anyone would
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.000]  miss. Well, I don't know. I mean, somebody might but most people would not mistake them for AirPods.
[56:14.000 --> 56:18.720]  Yeah. So so I feel like they could go with other colors, but they're definitely not.
[56:18.720 --> 56:26.000]  They are moving into a another color phase. Currently, yes. And I think it's possible
[56:26.000 --> 56:32.560]  that they could reconsider that as part of this new phase because they might ship them in
[56:32.560 --> 56:38.080]  iMac style colors, but I suspect not. If you could get them in another color, what color would you
[56:38.080 --> 56:46.880]  want? Maybe that that blue the new iPhone or I mean, I really liked the product red when I had
[56:46.880 --> 56:52.000]  an iPhone SE the you know, the current generation of iPhone SE for a while that red was really nice
[56:52.000 --> 56:56.720]  actually. Yeah, it's like a and like, I don't know if I would get black honestly. The only thing
[56:56.720 --> 57:00.720]  like if the case came in black, I might do that because it always the white always gets really
[57:00.720 --> 57:08.000]  blue. Keep it in my jeans. And I would like my my second generation case looks like crap. My stuff
[57:08.000 --> 57:14.640]  always gets blue to everything I especially AirPod cases because nine months of the year,
[57:15.280 --> 57:19.920]  I'm wearing blue jeans every single day. That was and that was like when I was checking out with
[57:19.920 --> 57:24.240]  these. I wanted to do engraving. I want to just put my initials on it or something like that. And
[57:24.240 --> 57:29.360]  it timed out on the engraving and I was kind of worried like, oh, geez, I don't want to not get
[57:29.360 --> 57:35.440]  these on day one. So I just I skipped the engraving and just went went ahead and bought
[57:35.440 --> 57:40.080]  them and I and later I thought it was like it's going to be fine because like first of all the
[57:40.080 --> 57:43.360]  case size is different than all the you know, Karen's got the older generation so that I'm
[57:43.360 --> 57:46.240]  not going to confuse it that way. But if she ever gets them mine are going to be blue.
[57:48.880 --> 57:54.000]  I guess it's also a logistics issue. You know, I mean, I know they do it with AirPods Max,
[57:54.000 --> 57:58.320]  and they have the colors and they you know, yeah, and they did it with iPods we just said, but
[57:58.320 --> 58:02.880]  you know, at some level, Tim Cook's got to be happier. Tim Cook and Jeff Williams are happier
[58:02.880 --> 58:06.880]  if right if the product marketing people are like, you know what, we're just we're once again,
[58:06.880 --> 58:10.720]  we're sticking with white. Yeah, well, and I know you don't want to talk about the MacBook Pro,
[58:10.720 --> 58:17.440]  but the cable is only one. Yes. Oh, man. Yeah. You know, it's always it's a nice touch. You know,
[58:17.440 --> 58:23.920]  we've got good friends and friend of the show, Jason Snell texted me after our reviews came out
[58:23.920 --> 58:28.000]  and said, Damn it, I wish I'd mentioned the thing about the cable too.
[58:30.640 --> 58:35.360]  And that's it's the it's the best compliment, right? Because I often you know, I'll do the same
[58:35.360 --> 58:41.040]  for him or panzerino or anybody else if when they make a point and I'm like, I even had that in my
[58:41.040 --> 58:47.280]  notes, and I forgot to put it in my review. It irks me because these are the multi thousand dollar
[58:47.280 --> 58:54.000]  multi thousand dollar laptops. And you can and I think space gray is the better color, in my
[58:54.000 --> 59:00.480]  opinion, or at least I like it better. And it comes with a silver magsafe connector and a white
[59:00.480 --> 59:07.120]  cable. And, and the other thing that really is sort of like salt in the wound is they just shipped
[59:07.120 --> 59:16.480]  those colorful IMAX six months ago. Yeah. And they each come with color coordinated power cables
[59:16.480 --> 59:23.440]  and color coordinated lightning cables. Right. With a nice braided this nice braided fabric.
[59:23.440 --> 59:28.560]  So if you get an if you get an orange IMAX, you get an orange lightning cable. So you can
[59:28.560 --> 59:36.800]  definitely do it. And these are more expensive machines than the IMAX. I don't know. Yeah.
[59:37.920 --> 59:43.040]  Yeah, I did. I mean, they they color the color stuff, like most of the color stuff,
[59:43.040 --> 59:50.000]  the bright color stuff is is usually for the non pro devices. So it makes a little bit of
[59:50.000 --> 59:53.440]  sense. But I mean, at least it's slightly consistent. I don't know if it makes sense,
[59:53.440 --> 59:58.080]  but it's, it's consistent. All right, let me take a break. Thank our next sponsors are good friends
[59:58.080 --> 01:00:05.040]  at LinkedIn. Today, many small business owners are busier than ever. Time spent searching for
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:10.240]  and interviewing candidates for jobs can take time away from managing and growing a business.
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:14.880]  Nobody likes to spend their time going through candidates as the worst part of the hiring
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:21.840]  process. That's why LinkedIn jobs has made it easier to get to the candidates who are worth
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:29.360]  interviewing faster. And it's free. You can create a free job post in minutes on LinkedIn jobs to
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:38.800]  reach your network and beyond to the world's largest professional social network of over 770
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:42.720]  million people. That's it's just crazy that LinkedIn has that many users but they do.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.520]  You can focus on candidates with the skills and experience you need. You can use screening
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:52.800]  questions to get your role in front of only the most qualified people and then use the simple

[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:05.440]  That's why small businesses rate LinkedIn jobs number one in delivering quality hires versus
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:10.720]  leading competitors. LinkedIn jobs helps you find the candidates worth interviewing faster.
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:17.760]  Every week, nearly 40 million job seekers visit LinkedIn. This is where people who are looking

[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:39.200]  The one other thing I was gonna mention is that they ship and maybe they did this with the pros
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:45.680]  too but this was the first one for me that they shipped with a USB-C to lightning cable inside
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:50.640]  the box which was nice because that's the kind that I actually need now because I don't have
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:56.560]  many of those. The previous ones were A to lightning. And they've started that with the
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:04.240]  watch too, right? And this has been a very tricky... I wouldn't want to manage it. That's
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:12.240]  not fun. A fun part of maybe designing products at Apple would be the argument over, hey, should
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:19.120]  we make product red AirPods? Should we make bright red earbuds? I don't know. And you can have fun
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:26.640]  mocking them up and doing it like managing the logistics of how do we move a billion users from
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:34.000]  USB-A cables to lightning to USB-C or the same thing with the watch. And like when do we do it?
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.120]  Should we do it now in 2019? Maybe it's too soon. I don't know. But we're not selling any MacBooks
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:44.720]  with USB-A ports anymore and people do charge these things from their ports on their MacBook.
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:49.200]  I don't know. It's like, are they moving too fast? I don't. I mean, I would never charge my
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.000]  AirPods that way, honestly. I don't think I would ever do that. I mean, in a very rare circumstance
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.040]  would I do that. I just need the cable for other stuff, mostly for connecting my iPhone.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.680]  I've run into that situation. This is one of those things now where we're so far into the pandemic
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:09.680]  and having done so little travel, a couple of brief months over the summer where we felt safe
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:20.320]  and we did. But it feels like another era, like black and white TV and listening to FM radio and
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:27.520]  taping cassettes. Remember traveling and going places? I remember just many, many times over
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:34.080]  the years realizing that my laptop bag, backpack or sling bag, whatever I was carrying at the time,
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:40.800]  didn't have enough chargers or something. But it's like, I always have a MacBook or going back
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:46.000]  far enough, a PowerBook or something. Wouldn't forget that charger. And if I had a cable,
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.840]  I could plug it in and charge other devices from the MacBook ports while traveling.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:59.280]  It just seems weird though. We're at the point now where USB-A seems old. And I know it's one
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:07.680]  of those things that, like VGA ports, are never ever going to actually die. Somebody out there
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:16.000]  still is using a projector somewhere with VGA out. USB-A ports are going to be places built
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:22.640]  into chairs at the airport or any of the various places where people have put them. You're going
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:29.920]  to be running into them for a decade, two decades at least. But they seem old, right?
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:38.080]  The watch charger thing is interesting because they advertise that the new Series 7 watches
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:47.280]  charge faster with the new charging puck, but only with that new charging puck that has USB-C
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:53.360]  at the end. But it's confusing because they previously made a charging puck with a USB-C port
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:57.440]  at the end, I guess last year. I don't even remember it. And they're not labeled, of course,
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:02.800]  because they're Apple products. There's nothing labeling it. And they're like, you got to use the
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:08.160]  new one if you want the faster charging. Don't use the old one. But it does charge faster,
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:14.240]  I'll just say. Not to go on an Apple Watch Series 7 side note, but I did a side-by-side. I don't do
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:18.640]  a lot of those sort of, hey, run the battery down and see how long it takes to charge. But
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:24.080]  the watch charge is so small and doesn't take long that it felt worth it. And it's like, yeah,
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:30.720]  it actually does. It charges not like three times as fast. It charges 40% faster for whatever the
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:35.680]  number is. But it's noticeable if you're ready to go in the morning and you just want to make
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:39.840]  some coffee and get something quick to eat. And it's like, you can charge up your Apple Watch
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:45.520]  a lot. Noticeably more if it was run down overnight than you would otherwise.
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:52.480]  Yeah. I never needed to charge it much. Yesterday, I think about midday, I noticed it seemed like it
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:57.200]  was down a little bit too far. And so I stuck it on the charger for 15 minutes or something. And
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:02.880]  it was plenty to make it through the rest of the day. I'd love to know what percentage of AirPod
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:11.840]  purchasers get the engraving. I have mine, the ones I bought engraved. We were laughing before
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:17.840]  about Apple upselling me on a polishing cloth. But they don't charge for the engraving,
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:24.400]  which even like any modest amount, like for five bucks more, you can get them engraved.
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:30.240]  I wouldn't hesitate to do it. I mean, I didn't hesitate to buy a $19 polishing cloth.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:37.520]  So obviously, I'm not good with not spending my money, so I would do it. But I think a lot of
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:44.720]  other people would, oh, I want to get some emoji engraved on my case or whatever. And I think a
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:50.720]  huge reason for it is families with multiple AirPod owners, let's tell them apart. You don't
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:58.000]  want to stick your son's gross AirPods. Or your son definitely doesn't want to stick your... I
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.680]  guess it's that way, right? Your teenage sons and daughters don't want to stick your gross old man
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:12.080]  AirPods into their ears. I don't think I told it on this show. Karen was having trouble. You
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:15.920]  could decide if you want to cut this story or not. But Karen was having trouble with a pair of
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:22.240]  AirPods. And I was looking online to see what could be the problem. One of them, the sound
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:26.960]  wasn't coming out very well. And eventually, little bits of earwax get caught in the grill
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:33.920]  and stuff like that. And so this guy's solution was you get a toothbrush and you scrape it a
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.600]  little bit in a circular motion, try and be gentle so you don't break the grill and stuff like that.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:51.760]  And then you suck on it. I was like, well, it's my wife. So I did it. And it worked. It worked
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:08:01.840]  really, really well. And it was really gross. But I started this whole segment the wrong way,
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:08.160]  because I would do that for my wife as well. I would. And it feels like
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:16.480]  dad business, right? Where the whole world is moving away from gender specific roles. And it's
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:22.720]  all for the better. And it's much better. But this is man business, right? Like, yeah,
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:27.520]  I don't think she was gonna do that. Yeah, I my wife would not do that for mine. And
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:30.880]  but I would do it for her. She certainly she definitely wouldn't do it for mine. I don't
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:37.520]  think she'd do it for her. And one of it's one of the light bulb moments of parenthood is that you
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:44.800]  I don't know why but it's you. As a parent, you're not grossed out by your kids stuff.
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:49.200]  Oh, yeah. Right. You can't afford to be right. You just can't the time you know,
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:55.120]  when when they're little, like the idea that Oh, I gotta go get a paper towel or like,
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:09:00.160]  no, I'm just like, Oh, this is like the kids snotty. I'm just gonna use my sleeve or eating
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:04.080]  food off their plate. Like you seriously you're not gonna need those last few bites. Ah, you know,
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:09.200]  I'll eat off your plate ID. I'll still eat off my son's plate. Whereas I wouldn't eat off my dad's
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:16.960]  plate. Right. I love my dad and my dad. I have always loved my I did not think that I would not
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:23.840]  eat off my dad's plate. It's not come up. If if my dad had a problem with his AirPods, which he
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:31.040]  doesn't even own. But if my dad had a problem with his AirPods, and I suspected that that trick might
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:37.040]  work, I would just go out and buy him a new pair of AirPods and and tell him that I used a cleaning
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:41.440]  trick I got on the internet. Here they are. Also, by the way, I polished the case up a little for
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:50.480]  you. And got it. And got it. Great. Yeah. So that was the thing, though, I need to I because I
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:54.720]  also got hung up on the emoji stuff. Like I was like, Oh, there's all these emoji and I was like,
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:58.000]  Oh, I should maybe I should. And then I was like, I'm taking too long. I'm taking too much time.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  And then it crashed. And so then I was like, I'm not going back into that. I'm just gonna buy them.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.840]  Well, you you buy this. So I think you like if you're if you're planning on buying AirPods on
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:10.000]  day one, and you want to get them engraved, make sure you know what you want on the engraving
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:16.880]  before you get into this will come as absolutely no surprise to you or any anybody who listens to
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:24.880]  the show and who's familiar with my proclivities. I would when I first got AirPod case, an AirPod
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:32.160]  case engraved, I noticed that it's like there's like four different trigger points where the font
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:38.640]  size changes so that it can fit more. Right? Like if you only get like, one, two or three letters,
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:46.160]  like maybe you just want your initials like JG or for you, j m. It's a the biggest font size.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:51.200]  And then you get to like, I forget what the points are. But I of course, obsessively figured out each
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:56.720]  one. It's like you get to four and it shrinks a little you get to like 13. It shrinks a little
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:06.560]  more. And I started playing around and as an old school graphic designer, you know, you can run
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:13.680]  into problems if you do things purely by counting characters because like the lowercase I is the
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:21.360]  narrowest character. Whereas an uppercase M or W is much wider. I forget exactly what they do. But
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.680]  then I got to the point where it's like, well, you know what I like? I like really small fonts.
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:31.120]  You know, I think small fonts look better. I would like my case engraved with a small font.
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:36.320]  But I don't have anything. I don't have a long string of text to engrave. And I really wished
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:42.960]  that they had let me just get my initials but use the smallest possible font size. And I start I was
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:50.800]  like, ah, I got it spaces. No, no. And then I thought, damn. And I was like, ah, but what about
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:57.840]  like option spaces to get like a Unicode thin space? Maybe, maybe they're just looking for
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:03.600]  space characters. No, no, they're doing like a regular expression search for all white space.
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:09.760]  And they don't count it. If it's on the sides. I also thought then I also I wasted a lot of time.
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.200]  Trenton Larkin Your eyesight is terrible. I'm
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:12.800]  surprised you still like small fonts.
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.560]  Michael Jordan You know, my eyesight has
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:19.920]  gone back and forth. It's been a wild roller coaster over five years. But I'm at the point
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:26.480]  now where my eyesight is actually much better for small stuff than it was two or three years ago.
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:31.680]  I'm back to being able to read pretty small, pretty small stuff when I take my take my glasses
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:39.360]  off or use like my progressive lenses. So I'm back to that. But that is a good point. I also,
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:45.360]  of course, spent an inordinate amount of time. It just way more I mean, like a ridiculous amount
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:51.200]  of time like it and couldn't tell my wife because it would be like a don't you have something better
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:13:01.280]  to do. But trying to sneak swear words past their, their filters. Like, like, how smart are they,
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:07.200]  you know, so obviously just matching for a known list of swear words or inappropriate words that
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:14.800]  they will refuse to engrave. That's not going to work. But things like putting a Unicode thin space
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:23.040]  between the F and the U, you know, would that work? Would that get it past? And, and then I
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:29.280]  enlisted friend of the show, Daniel Jowkett in this and he got it to a point where they let him
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:36.000]  put it into the cart with a swear, some kind of inappropriate thing using some kind of trickery
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.680]  like that, you know, Unicode spaces or something, but then it would wouldn't let them check out.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:47.040]  So there's like a subsequent level of checking beyond the engraving tool where there and then,
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:50.800]  and then it would just and it would like take them out of your cart and set you back. It was like,
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:57.360]  like, get getting the worst shoot and shoots and ladders, you know, the one that that would make
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:02.400]  your little siblings cry if they landed on it, because it would send them all the way back to
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:06.400]  the beginning. And it's like all of a sudden, you don't even have AirPods in your cart anymore. And
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:14.160]  you've got to, but that's the way my mind thinks. I get like, have you ever put like your phone
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:18.800]  number on them? I mean, it seems like that's probably, yeah, I, well, I never thought of it,
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:23.760]  but I think Karen had a case that she had him in and that she had her phone number and the person,
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:26.240]  you know, somebody found him in a parking lot and called her and she got him back.
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:28.880]  Yeah, that's pretty, that's not a bad way to do it. And it's, you know,
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:33.040]  Or an email. Yeah. Like you could, you could put a, you know, like a burner email account on there.
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:37.600]  Yeah. Yeah. Cause I wouldn't want to put my real email for some reason.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:43.040]  Yeah, I wouldn't either make up a, make up an iCloud, you know, they'll have to have a
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:47.840]  temporary iCloud one. Yeah, I guess. But then you, then I'd start to wonder though,
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:55.200]  if I, you know, make up a temporary iCloud one, but it's not an easily typable string or somebody,
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:59.520]  you know, are they going to be like, ah, you know, I seven, six, five, four,
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:04.880]  three iCloud.com forget it. Don't like make them jump through hoops to return your earbuds.
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:11.200]  Yeah. I'm not quite sure, but it, you know, I have phone number. I bet that's very common.
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:16.880]  For some reason I never wanted, like, I, I don't know why I've never, I've never done it. And I'm
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:20.720]  always leery of just putting my information on anything. I guess is probably what, what it is.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:27.360]  Yeah. We're two, you and I are two, we're probably overly conservative about stuff like that. Like,
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:33.760]  yeah. You know, it's, it's, I still laugh. We were just, we were just talking the other day about,
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:39.440]  how back when we, Amy and I went to college, both of our schools, both the University of
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:44.800]  Pittsburgh and Drexel used your social security number as your student ID.
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:49.120]  Oh yeah. Your student ID. Yeah. I don't think my, I don't think my school did that,
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:53.680]  but honestly I don't remember so long ago. And that's how you would order that we,
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:59.520]  you used to be able to get Drexel had like a, the way that the food plan worked your freshman year
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:04.720]  is you, you didn't just get meals like, Oh, you can get like three meals a day at the cafeteria.
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:12.160]  You got like $72 a week that you could spend at Drexel's food services. So one of the ways you
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:17.760]  could spend it is go to lunch in the cafeteria and, you know, but you could also from like your
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:23.920]  dorm call up Drexel's pizza, which was the worst pizza in all of Philadelphia. Just the absolute
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:31.120]  worst. Like, you know, like how pizza cheese is supposed to be closer to white or yellow.
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:38.480]  It was orange. It was orange cheese. It was terrible. But, but if you had no real money
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:45.920]  to call a real pizza place and you still had, you know, 13, 14 bucks left on your weekly food
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:50.960]  service allowance, but you would just call up, tell them your dorm room number, and then to pay,
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:56.480]  you would just read, read them your social security number. And then they would be like,
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:00.320]  okay, you've got $7 remaining. And you'd be like, okay, thanks. And they'd, you know,
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:04.160]  they'd know my name. They'd be like, okay, John. You know, cause once they typed it in,
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:09.200]  it all came up. In fact, now that I think about it, you may not have even had to tell them your
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:12.720]  dorm room number. You might've just given them your student ID and they knew your dorm room
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:19.360]  number, which is even worse. Like they had a book full of everybody. The school probably
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:25.680]  printed out a book that did that. So anyway, I'm loathe to even tell anybody my name.
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:29.600]  I wonder how those, you know, they'll get a key and it said, drop in any mailbox.
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:34.720]  Yes. I wonder how that works. Like you should be able to get one of those, you know,
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:38.800]  where it's not even, it doesn't even have any information on there. It's just drop just some
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:43.680]  magic. So I don't know. We should get like a mailman on the show. Anyway, let me take a
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:49.200]  break here and think we have a third and final sponsor returning to the show and they're earnest.

[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:13.920]  Man, that's, yeah. I got a note.

[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:21.040]  Are you a Curb Your Enthusiasm fan?
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:25.840]  No, no. I've seen a little bit, but not that much.
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:32.480]  It's funny. We're big fans. The show has always been on HBO and the new season started last week.
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:37.600]  I guess it's going to last all season. I'm not sure. But the gimmick is that Larry David
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:42.320]  is selling a new sitcom to Netflix, which is interesting. It's just an interesting little
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:51.360]  thing to me. I presume that Netflix, that they okayed it and that the people at HBO
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:56.960]  are okay with the fictional version of Larry David selling a show to Netflix and that they
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:02.480]  got Netflix's permit. It's just a weird meta thing that Amy didn't want to talk to me at all about.
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:13.280]  But he pitches the show to these Netflix officials and they love it. And they're like,
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:17.280]  I think we're going to go ahead. We're going to do it. And he's like, you're going to enjoy
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:20.960]  working with me. I'm easy to work with. Don't worry about what people say. And they're like,
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:24.400]  ah, and everybody's laughing and a meeting is breaking up. And he goes, but no notes.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:27.360]  Don't send me notes. And they laugh. And he goes, no, I mean that.
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:37.760]  With my show, and I think in a real world where you do these shows for big companies like HBO
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:43.600]  and Netflix and any of the movie studios, everybody who follows movies closely knows
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:48.320]  about notes. I don't know where the lingo came from. It seems like an entertainment industry
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:57.680]  thing. You watch something and you say, I have notes. In the computer world, we don't talk about
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:04.640]  notes. If you're making a new app, your boss doesn't say, I have some notes. Maybe they do,
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:12.480]  but it's not so much of a term of art. I got a note about not reading the small print on
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:19.920]  Ernest, but they're good people. Well, yeah, we get stuff like that. Anytime you're on a podcast
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:26.240]  and you have advertisers, every once in a while, they'll listen in and they'll say, could you tweak
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:29.920]  this? Could you do that? And that's what they're paying for.
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:33.520]  That's what they're paying for. And the other thing that I truly appreciate
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:40.640]  is I truly appreciate and understand the fact that it's a very regulated industry and that
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:46.480]  it's not for nothing that they would like me to assert all the specific legal details at the end.
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:49.120]  Yeah. Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:53.840]  I don't have a lot to say about it, but have you upgraded to Mac OS 12 Monterey?
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:23:01.520]  I have. I did that on Monday when it came or not the minute it came out, but that afternoon.
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:02.320]  What are your thoughts?
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:08.880]  Um, I like it so far. I, um, I think the, the widgets I've actually enjoyed because
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:16.000]  now I have a widget for, and I, for some, like, this seems more usable to me than like dashboard
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:22.000]  did. Um, cause I've actually been using it a lot more than I used to use. Well, I don't,
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:28.160]  maybe in the beginning I used dashboard a lot, but, um, I've got three things on here that I,
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:36.640]  that I have on my phone and I check it fairly frequently. So, I mean, the control center is
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:43.120]  still, still seems very weird. The widgets, the widgets thing. That's a good, that's a good,
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:52.880]  that's a good note, John. But I agree with it because, uh, it, it taking an app from iOS
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:59.040]  to Mac and just letting it run, let's say like the home home app or, or some of the first catalyst
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:06.400]  apps, like, uh, the news and the stocks, uh, apps. It just doesn't, it just felt like you
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:12.320]  were running an iOS app in the simulator, you know, and if you've ever kicked, if you're either
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:18.400]  a developer of iPhone apps or iPad apps, or even just kicked around with Xcode playing with it,
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:24.560]  you know what I mean? Where it's cool that you can run your iPhone app on your Mac while you're
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:30.400]  developing it in a simulator, but it always felt like you were running an iPhone app in a
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:37.200]  simulator. Um, it just didn't feel Mac like, and the, the quick and easy, like, like the home app
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:41.920]  still to me, doesn't really look and feel like a Mac app. It feels like an iPad app running on
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:52.000]  the Mac. The widgets are narrowly constrained in a way that they feel just at home across the board.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:56.880]  Right. And that there's not buttons and controls and there's not a lot of interactivity. They're
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:03.600]  just sort of like little, little status panels. And somehow they've, they've squared that circle
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:08.960]  in a very neat way where they feel very much at home. Uh, and I like them. I do too. And I,
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:15.840]  I think dashboard is one of those ideas where they've been like taking several stabs at it
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:22.080]  over the decades now. And I feel like they finally got it. Yeah, I think so too. I mean,
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:28.160]  well, we'll see. I mean, I, cause I, you know, I think I used dashboard for, for a while because
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:33.360]  I used to, what's the, there's that iStat menus thing, right? That is now in the menu. You can
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:38.080]  get it on the menu bar. So you don't like, I had that for a long time and I don't currently use it.
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:42.560]  And so I remember going into, but I think that was back when, you know, back to our point about,
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:49.360]  uh, how max used memory and whatnot. Now, like, I don't feel like I need it anymore, uh, is the
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:55.120]  thing. I don't feel resource constrained anymore. Whereas when I was using, you know, 400 megahertz
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:26:04.160]  power book, I really did, you know, with a, with a physical disk. Right. Uh, my big feature,
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:10.560]  the one that is, uh, I still, my main machine is still running macOS 11 Big Sur. And over the
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:15.760]  years, I've gotten a little bit more conservative about when I upgrade to the latest version of
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:20.960]  macOS 10 on my main machine, but it's prompting me to do it as soon as I have like all of my current
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:28.320]  work done. And I feel like just in case something goes bad, I can blow a day fixing it. I'm upgrading
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:35.280]  is live text because, and I know that's on all platforms and I've been playing with,
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:41.760]  I've been using the iOS betas all summer and there are times I'd use live text, but for me,
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:47.680]  the type of situations where I want to use live text are way more common on a Mac, right? Like,
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:52.320]  I want to, I've got a picture of a thing I want, or, you know, here's this text on a printed thing.
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:57.840]  I don't want to retype it. You know, I'm not, it's, it seems like long work. I don't want to do,
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:01.600]  oh, I'll just take a picture and you take a picture and select it. And it's like, this is amazing.
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:09.520]  Yeah. Yeah. It's absolutely. I had a, I was telling Paul and the Slack, uh, earlier today,
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:14.080]  I had a, I had a recipe that I've had for like 20 years for Vietnamese catfish. And it's,
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:19.120]  it's excellent. I love it. And it's the only recipe that I have that is actually something
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:22.640]  that we ripped out of a magazine a long time ago when we used to get something,
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:28.560]  I don't remember where it was. And so I would always go to the recipe box that we still have
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:32.720]  and pull it out every time I was going to make Vietnamese catfish. And I like earlier back in
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:36.960]  May, I finally like, I should, I'll take a picture of it. Um, and then, and then eventually,
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:42.880]  cause I use paprika for all, uh, uh, my recipes and I was thinking, I'll just type it in. Cause
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:47.760]  I'm tired of like going to find it every single time. And I took the picture of it in May and
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:54.080]  never, never typed it in, but I still had the picture. And so when I was, it suddenly hit me
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:59.360]  once I upgraded to, to Monterey, like, Oh, I don't have to type it anymore. And I opened it
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:04.560]  up and just copy pasted and put it in the paprika and did a little bit of editing. And now I have
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:10.480]  it. And I made it less to be clear. Paprika is a recipe app, not it's, you're not just talking
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:15.120]  about using the spice. No, no, they're actually, there's no paprika in this. I was going to say
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:20.880]  that would be a hell of a coincidence, but yeah. Um, it's, it's a feature that a, once you get
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:25.920]  used to it, you, you almost can't go back to not having it. So it's like making me look at every
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:32.320]  machine I have, that's not updated to the latest and greatest and cast a stink. I add it. But like,
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:36.720]  when I first started, it was like, when they announced it, I was like, that sounds awesome.
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:43.680]  And I know that there have been OCR is a long standing thing and there's, there's a utility
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:49.360]  called tech sniper for the Mac that he'll never believe who, who turned me on to it.
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:57.280]  Paul, I bet I will. I bet I will believe Paul capacity. Oh, you don't say Paul. I wish this
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:02.640]  is just Paul from now on. You should have had Paul. I think, uh, I think that's the, and it's,
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:08.640]  it's really tech sniper is great. I wish I had known about it years ago. Um, and if you,
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:15.120]  for whatever reason, either out of personal hesitancy or specific technical limitations or
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:22.080]  rules, can't upgrade to Mac OS 12 Monterey yet. I, I'll, you should definitely take a look at
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:27.440]  tech sniper in the meantime, but even tech sniper, which is works great, very accurate,
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:31.760]  very pretty convenient to use. It's sort of like taking a screenshot where it's like, you,
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:37.120]  you say, I want to capture some text and you go into a mode and you get like a cursor or
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:42.560]  that, that looks like a plus symbol and you can drag it around the text you want to capture and
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:47.440]  you get it, you know, it works pretty well, but nothing, it can't compete with something built
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:51.440]  into the system where every time that you open an image, there's this little icon that says,
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:56.400]  I've already identified texts here. Just click here and you can copy it. Like, like it's live
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:03.120]  text. It is, it's amazing. And it, to me is, like I said, it's so much something I, I will
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:09.120]  use so much more on the Mac than, than anywhere else, even though I'm glad it's on iOS and iPad
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:16.320]  too, but it's my favorite feature of Monterey. And I would update to Monterey, even if that
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:21.120]  was the only feature, if they were just like, you remember everything else we announced at WWDC?
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:27.600]  Well, that's all postponed, but we do have live text. I would be like four gigabytes download
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:35.120]  right now. Here we go. Yeah. Yeah. The other thing that I think that the second probably
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:39.120]  actually, I mean, this was the first thing that I noticed for sure was simply the return of
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:47.840]  sensible tabs in Safari. Yeah. Yeah. They it's, that's a funny one in terms of how Apple has
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:54.480]  played it publicly. Yeah. Yeah. Like I was looking at the feature list from Monterey and it's,
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:57.840]  you know, it's really, you know, there's a lot of good stuff. It's like, yeah, there's more,
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:04.560]  there's more here than I remember. I have like a, a basic sense that MacOS 12 Monterey is not
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:11.200]  a huge update and it's not that different than MacOS 11 Big Sur in a good way, right? Like in
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:17.200]  a snow leopard, no major new features way. And people, you know, some of those are the
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:24.160]  some of those are the best remembered MacOS versions over the years because they focused
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:30.320]  engineering resources on stability and, and fixing bugs and not adding a lot of, but there's,
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:35.120]  there's a lot of, there's more new stuff than I remembered off the top of my head. But like the
[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:42.320]  Safari list was, is now funny because like the last bullet item is optional compact tab mode
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:51.600]  and saves space. And it's like, I laugh and I'm not trying to make fun. I'm glad that it worked
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:57.280]  out the way it did, you know, that, that they, that they changed their mind collectively and
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:02.560]  reverted to tabs that look like, not just when you're not in compact mode, but that that's
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:08.240]  actually the default tabs too. So that like my parents won't call me up and be like, I don't
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:13.920]  understand. Oh yeah. Yeah. I don't, I don't want to, I didn't get that. My parents did that didn't
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:18.880]  occur to me, but I thought if Karen updated, I would be, yeah, I would be hearing about it.
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:23.840]  So I'm glad they reverted that. I think it was a change that, you know, again, worth trying,
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:30.000]  but never should have made it out of the prototype stage and probably should have been nixed early
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:39.840]  and somehow didn't, but it is, it does, it does make for a funny safari section in the Monterey.
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:52.640]  Tabs still don't suck, right? Sucky tab option added. But, you know, I, but I do, I mean that
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:58.800]  in a very complimentary way. I feel like Big Sur was a 11, macOS 11 Big Sur was a, you know,
[01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:05.760]  a total corner to corner refresh of the UI, not radical, but they redrew all everything. You know,
[01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:13.680]  the menu bar looks different and they added the control center, which like you said, it still is
[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:19.840]  a little weird on the Mac, but yeah, it seems a little out of place. Like it doesn't seem,
[01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:24.000]  it seems very, it seems sort of iOS, but lots of stuff, you know, they made, they made a couple
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:30.560]  of things more iOS-y for whatever reasons, but Monterey isn't like that, but in a good way,
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:35.840]  right? Like it's just sort of polished up stuff and, and I like it. And I've had very good,
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:40.080]  you know, a couple of Macs I've had it on, including the review unit upstairs, which,
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:46.480]  you know, the new MacBook Pro, which of course has to have Monterey because new hardware
[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:52.640]  always runs the latest operating system. Kudos to Apple for, for shipping it. I guess the one buggy
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:57.360]  thing is shortcuts. Do you use the shortcuts? I don't. That's the thing. I don't use shortcuts,
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:01.520]  but yeah, that is, that's definitely whatever. Yeah. And I, you know, I don't want to go into
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:07.440]  it in detail. It is a weird, I think it's a weird saga though, where the long, I think the,
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:13.520]  the very, the lay person's explanation is that there's three ways to make a Mac app,
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:20.160]  but a native one, the app kit, which is the longstanding framework that goes all the way back
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:28.400]  to next, which is what most Mac apps are written with. You can use catalyst, which is sort of
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:35.600]  debuted alongside Swift UI, what three years ago, and is a way to use UI kit, which is the,
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:42.640]  the equivalent of app kit from iOS, but you could use that now on the Mac too. And it's a way,
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:50.400]  you know, the, the idea is that you could share a code base across platforms to save time.
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:55.600]  And also for developers, there's just way more iPhone and iPad developers than there are
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:03.440]  Mac developers. Well, you know, maybe this will get more Mac apps and Swift UI and Swift UI is
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:10.720]  actually, it is also used to make all the widgets and it's Swift UI is great for widgets. Swift UI
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:17.920]  does not seem great yet for apps. And, but the way, you know, there's that term dog fooding,
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:22.720]  right? Like the way that a company needs to dog, they need to eat their own dog food, meaning use
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:28.480]  their own tools, use their own stuff. And, you know, you have to, somebody, somebody has to be
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:35.920]  the first major app inside Apple to use Swift UI as, as the framework to make the whole app.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:42.800]  And it turns out it was shortcuts and it, you know, it, it, it was a Rocky landing
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:52.560]  is a way to put it, uh, you, you know, uh, Federico Faticchi, uh, is, is the biggest shortcuts
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:36:00.640]  fanad fan power user I could imagine. He not only, he writes about them, he shares them to
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:06.800]  Mac stories, users, and some of them do amazing things. It's, and, you know, and he, he'll say,
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:11.040]  he's not a programmer. And it's like, no, you're a programmer. Shortcuts hasn't turned you into
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:15.520]  a programmer. This is like a mental model for programming that, that works for you.
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:21.040]  And you're building these amazing things. And I'm, I read his stuff and it's not just on Mac,
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:25.680]  it's, you know, everywhere. It's like, it's shortcuts. It's like sometimes you enter,
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:32.240]  you know, you, it's like give a 30 step shortcut and every three steps, the apps just stops letting
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:39.520]  you enter text and you have to close it, go back, reopen it. It's, it's Rocky. And it's,
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:44.080]  it's really kind of weird. It's, I'm glad it's there on Mac OS 12 Monterey. And it's,
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:50.240]  I can't wait to see once this, it stabilizes, you know, as a long time automation nerd and
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:56.560]  Apple script user, and I use keyboard maestro, but none of those things go cross platform,
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:02.240]  right? Apple script and keyboard maestro are only on the Mac and shortcuts was only on the iPhone.
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:07.360]  And shortcuts seems to be a path forward where, where this automator was Mac only,
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:19.920]  but where shortcuts, you know, is today is, is not, not, not good. Yeah. Anything else?
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:26.800]  A quick note. I haven't used it yet, but I liked the idea and I expect that I will.
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:34.000]  Well, my thanks to you for being on the show. You, you've, what else? What do you want to promote?
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.560]  We already mentioned the rebound, which is podcast with a membership system.
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:43.920]  That's right. Uh, you can be a rebound prime member, rebound prime member. Love it. We'd
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:48.640]  love it if you would, if you would consider that. Uh, and I do a podcast called Biff with, uh, Dan
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:55.520]  and friend of the show guy, English. She should have Paul on that show.
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:00.880]  I think Paul watches super, does Paul watch superhero shows? I don't know. It doesn't seem
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:04.400]  like his bag. It doesn't seem like Paul would watch superhero, but it would have made,
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:11.760]  it would have made for a funny gag on this show. So yeah. And sometimes I hang out with Paul.
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:19.680]  I will thank our sponsors. We had earnest where you can refinance your student loans,
