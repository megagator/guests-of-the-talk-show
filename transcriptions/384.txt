[00:00.000 --> 00:01.680]  How are you feeling, buddy?
[00:01.680 --> 00:03.840]  I'm OK. I'm a little under the weather.
[00:03.840 --> 00:07.880]  But talking about the Apple Vision Pro and talking to you gets me out of my cave.
[00:09.400 --> 00:10.600]  Covid, how long do you think?
[00:10.600 --> 00:13.240]  I feel like we're probably the rest of our lives.
[00:13.240 --> 00:14.000]  We'll be talking.
[00:14.000 --> 00:17.000]  Ah, son of a bitch. I got Covid again.
[00:17.000 --> 00:18.040]  Yeah, well, you know what?
[00:18.040 --> 00:21.080]  The way I see it is it's like cold or flu, it's just it's here to stay.
[00:21.080 --> 00:21.640]  We'll get it.
[00:21.640 --> 00:24.680]  It'll hopefully be not bad as long as you're vaccinated, boosted
[00:24.680 --> 00:27.880]  and take care of yourself, and it'll just be part of life.
[00:27.880 --> 00:32.920]  Well, it does seem like supposedly, I guess the more the longer time goes on,
[00:32.920 --> 00:36.840]  the more the variants are optimizing themselves for contagiousness
[00:36.840 --> 00:39.960]  and less so for being terrible.
[00:39.960 --> 00:42.840]  But knock on wood for me, here I am knocking on wood.
[00:43.800 --> 00:45.600]  But I haven't had I got it once.
[00:45.600 --> 00:47.840]  I've only had it once ever last July.
[00:47.840 --> 00:49.160]  Terrible sore throat.
[00:49.160 --> 00:50.240]  I mean, just awful.
[00:50.240 --> 00:53.080]  I got a knife in my throat, but not since.
[00:53.080 --> 00:54.680]  How about you? How many times have you had it?
[00:54.680 --> 00:57.360]  So this is my second. I was really trying to avoid it.
[00:57.360 --> 01:00.240]  I will tell you this was it just felt like a cold.
[01:00.240 --> 01:01.600]  I definitely had the sore throat.
[01:01.600 --> 01:02.480]  It felt like stuffy.
[01:02.480 --> 01:03.400]  I'm getting over it now.
[01:03.400 --> 01:04.840]  So you have all that congestion.
[01:04.840 --> 01:08.960]  But I will tell you, this wave is definitely I'm not trying to.
[01:08.960 --> 01:13.080]  Hopefully I won't bring you bad news, but everyone I know is getting it.
[01:13.120 --> 01:15.120]  Emily, like it's burning through.
[01:15.120 --> 01:16.760]  It definitely is on the rise.
[01:16.760 --> 01:19.400]  So be careful out there. Yeah, yeah.
[01:19.400 --> 01:21.440]  Well, I had to laugh, though.
[01:21.440 --> 01:24.240]  I open up my Apple developer news
[01:24.240 --> 01:27.600]  and I see that my dumb brain works.
[01:27.600 --> 01:32.200]  I see you in a photograph at the top.
[01:32.920 --> 01:35.200]  And I think to myself, I can't wait.
[01:35.200 --> 01:36.280]  I got to text Michael.
[01:36.280 --> 01:39.840]  There's a dude on this thing that looked like, oh, no, that is him.
[01:42.400 --> 01:46.440]  I guess from everyone, people on even on when I posted on LinkedIn,
[01:46.440 --> 01:50.320]  people were like, I knew it was you right away or that dude looks like you or whatever.
[01:50.320 --> 01:53.520]  It was just very funny that everyone saw the photo and reacted that way.
[01:53.520 --> 01:58.680]  But for people who don't know, you and I are pals.
[01:58.680 --> 02:01.120]  We text every week, frequently enough.
[02:01.120 --> 02:04.760]  But I did not know that you were going to the developer lab.
[02:04.760 --> 02:08.000]  I don't know if you secretly withheld that from me or just didn't come up.
[02:08.000 --> 02:09.360]  But I did not know.
[02:09.360 --> 02:12.360]  But I really did think for like a full 10 seconds,
[02:12.360 --> 02:15.160]  there's a dude who looks like Michael Simmons.
[02:15.160 --> 02:17.040]  Oh, of course, it is Michael Simmons.
[02:17.040 --> 02:19.560]  So where were you? Were you out? You were out in California.
[02:19.560 --> 02:25.240]  So obviously, in this conversation, there will be big generalizations and it will be.
[02:25.240 --> 02:28.920]  I will tell you as much as I can tell you feeling comfortable about telling you,
[02:28.920 --> 02:31.920]  but I want to tell you lots of really good things.
[02:33.040 --> 02:37.600]  We're going to call let's call it pleading the fifth because you obviously reading the fifth.
[02:37.600 --> 02:39.800]  Yeah. Not that you're incriminating yourself,
[02:39.800 --> 02:45.240]  but you would be incriminating yourself against the non-disclosure agreement that you know.
[02:45.240 --> 02:50.760]  And the truth is this. Obviously, I want to be able to talk about what my experiences were
[02:50.760 --> 02:52.800]  and also be excited about the device.
[02:52.800 --> 02:56.000]  But generally, general questions about what happened,
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.680]  which obviously was an Apple event, should probably stay offline.
[03:00.680 --> 03:03.880]  So any question I ask that you feel like, I don't want to answer that.
[03:03.880 --> 03:05.120]  You just say I plead the fifth.
[03:05.120 --> 03:09.400]  So you don't even want to say where the lab was that you participated and were photographed at?
[03:10.680 --> 03:12.800]  It's OK. I can't probably plead the fifth.
[03:12.800 --> 03:14.680]  The thing is, I feel like it's a benign question.
[03:14.680 --> 03:17.640]  I feel like if I told you wouldn't be a big deal, but not important.
[03:17.640 --> 03:19.400]  Yeah, I think that Apple has been clear.
[03:19.400 --> 03:23.920]  I think they're having them in California, London and maybe somewhere else.
[03:23.920 --> 03:26.080]  How about this? It was California or New York.
[03:26.440 --> 03:32.640]  OK. Can you say how much time you got to use it?
[03:32.640 --> 03:35.480]  I mean, like a day care. All right. How much time?
[03:35.800 --> 03:38.880]  That was quite a bit of time. It was enough time, not only.
[03:39.240 --> 03:44.080]  So my goal when this whole thing was happening was to both be the excited user,
[03:44.080 --> 03:46.360]  like how is this thing as a customer user?
[03:46.640 --> 03:47.680]  I want to know more.
[03:47.680 --> 03:50.240]  I give me all the dirt, give me all the info.
[03:50.240 --> 03:53.680]  But I also wanted it half as a developer, making an app
[03:53.680 --> 03:57.400]  that I really want to take advantage of the technology and the platform.
[03:58.040 --> 03:59.800]  And I think it's worth emphasizing.
[03:59.800 --> 04:05.400]  You've been on the show before and Flexibits software, the flagship product.
[04:05.400 --> 04:08.640]  I think it's fair to describe it as the flagship is Fantastical.
[04:08.960 --> 04:09.640]  I would agree.
[04:09.640 --> 04:15.160]  Cardhop is the sort of sibling of what Fantastical is to calendaring.
[04:15.160 --> 04:20.440]  Cardhop is to contact management to great, to great apps that sort of
[04:21.640 --> 04:24.400]  have been tied together in suites,
[04:24.400 --> 04:29.120]  going back as far as the dawn of indie developing time. Right.
[04:29.120 --> 04:31.440]  I remember the remember now utilities.
[04:31.440 --> 04:35.720]  They had a didn't now have a great calendaring app back in the 90s.
[04:36.120 --> 04:38.600]  I can't believe how old we're getting and how many years go by.
[04:38.600 --> 04:42.600]  But I feel like that somehow led to BusyCal, which is ironic.
[04:42.640 --> 04:44.480]  Yeah, maybe. Yeah.
[04:44.480 --> 04:47.480]  Now and then they split off or something. Yeah. Yeah.
[04:47.480 --> 04:49.320]  My brain is telling me there. Maybe I'm wrong.
[04:49.320 --> 04:50.680]  Yeah. John Chaffee.
[04:50.680 --> 04:53.040]  I forget his colleague and co-founders name.
[04:53.680 --> 04:56.360]  Wriggle Wriggle Wriggle. Yes. Yes, exactly.
[04:56.360 --> 04:58.840]  He had a very nice guy, Dave Wriggle.
[04:58.880 --> 05:03.600]  Yeah, I think that they were the actual engineering and design
[05:03.600 --> 05:08.080]  mojo behind the now calendaring and then parted ways with the company
[05:08.080 --> 05:10.240]  and built their own thing a while back.
[05:10.360 --> 05:11.560]  But anyway, they go together.
[05:11.560 --> 05:12.600]  I love the apps.
[05:12.600 --> 05:15.200]  I'll bet lots of people listening to this show.
[05:15.200 --> 05:16.600]  I mean, if you don't
[05:16.600 --> 05:19.680]  if you haven't tried Fantastical and Cardhop, you're crazy.
[05:19.680 --> 05:21.640]  I mean, I'm not just saying that because Michael's on the show,
[05:21.640 --> 05:25.200]  but I mean, for God's sake, I mean, they're just they exemplify everything
[05:25.880 --> 05:30.000]  that interests me in computers, doing things right, doing things good.
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.640]  But I think that the core.
[05:32.640 --> 05:36.000]  Thing that is interesting in the context of you
[05:36.000 --> 05:42.360]  getting a developer preview from Apple in the lab is that
[05:44.280 --> 05:48.320]  Fantastical and Cardhop are true
[05:48.320 --> 05:52.320]  native apps for the Apple platform ecosystem. Right.
[05:52.320 --> 05:55.240]  The Mac apps are Mac asked Mac apps.
[05:55.560 --> 06:00.520]  The iOS apps are like the more, if anything, even more
[06:01.200 --> 06:05.920]  idiomatically iOS ish than Apple's apps. Right.
[06:05.920 --> 06:08.000]  They just feel so native.
[06:08.000 --> 06:11.960]  And I think that's such a leg up
[06:11.960 --> 06:15.160]  when Apple introduces a new platform
[06:15.560 --> 06:20.160]  because you're already familiar with the way Apple's frameworks work.
[06:20.760 --> 06:26.200]  And if you've been following, I mean, one thing long time Apple developers,
[06:26.200 --> 06:30.440]  third party developers know is you need to read between the lines of Apple's advice
[06:30.440 --> 06:33.880]  because Apple will tell you they won't tell you what they're not
[06:33.880 --> 06:37.480]  haven't announced yet, but they'll give you hints as a developer.
[06:37.480 --> 06:41.560]  And if you follow those hints, you'll be ready for new things
[06:41.800 --> 06:45.760]  before they actually ship like I can give you a perfect example
[06:45.760 --> 06:46.600]  to prove you're right.
[06:46.600 --> 06:51.280]  So you remember at the event Fantastical was mentioned in compatible apps.
[06:51.680 --> 06:54.480]  They had an icon on the screen with a bunch of compatible apps.
[06:54.800 --> 06:58.080]  Well, we came to find out that because our iPad app
[06:58.400 --> 07:02.560]  had been designed properly with auto layout and all of the Apple technologies
[07:02.560 --> 07:05.680]  and dynamic fonts and whatever dynamic type.
[07:05.680 --> 07:09.520]  I'm just saying everything that Apple kind of says, hey, you should be doing this.
[07:09.920 --> 07:13.680]  Our app was ready for Apple Vision Pro as a compatible app.
[07:13.960 --> 07:16.320]  We didn't know that, but we did the right practices.
[07:16.320 --> 07:18.440]  So I just want to validate what you just said.
[07:18.440 --> 07:22.160]  Yeah, that was in the keynote right back in in June. Yeah.
[07:22.640 --> 07:24.760]  And so that was at the Apple Vision Pro event.
[07:24.760 --> 07:26.000]  Yeah, we did not know.
[07:26.000 --> 07:30.440]  Yeah. So it wasn't like they contacted you and said, hey,
[07:30.440 --> 07:33.640]  we would like to use Fantastical to do blank.
[07:34.040 --> 07:37.320]  Can you cut us a special build of whatever?
[07:37.320 --> 07:42.280]  It's the fact that the iPad sized version of the iOS
[07:42.280 --> 07:45.320]  version of Fantastical just runs out of the box.
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.600]  Natively, in a sense, on VisionOS
[07:50.160 --> 07:53.000]  doing the right thing meant you guys got featured
[07:53.400 --> 07:57.360]  in a major Apple keynote just because you did the right thing.
[07:57.360 --> 08:01.320]  Correct. And we were actually told after the keynote they did kind of hint
[08:01.320 --> 08:05.160]  to say, hey, kudos to you guys for doing all the right things
[08:05.160 --> 08:06.960]  and following all the right things.
[08:06.960 --> 08:11.120]  You have basically a perfect iPad app that works on Apple Vision Pro.
[08:11.120 --> 08:13.880]  And that made us feel good because we invested a lot of time, money
[08:13.880 --> 08:16.920]  and effort into making the best iPad app we can. Right.
[08:17.200 --> 08:21.560]  One thing I know and I think that the pull of.
[08:21.560 --> 08:26.600]  Cross platform development and of the famous mantra for decades
[08:26.600 --> 08:29.640]  has always been write once, run anywhere.
[08:30.240 --> 08:35.760]  I mean, the appeal of that superficially is so obvious and it's way more obvious
[08:35.760 --> 08:40.600]  at a superficial level than the benefits of going the opposite route.
[08:40.600 --> 08:44.480]  And instead of writing something, whatever the app or game or whatever
[08:44.480 --> 08:50.680]  you're doing in a cross platform toolkit that can run on Windows
[08:50.680 --> 08:55.600]  and Mac and Linux or wherever else, or for mobile,
[08:55.600 --> 08:59.520]  that's the same code base for Android phones and iPhones.
[08:59.520 --> 09:02.480]  And maybe it's a Web app, too, or something like that.
[09:03.280 --> 09:06.760]  The benefits of cross platform development are so superficially obvious,
[09:06.760 --> 09:10.680]  like, right, if you could really just write it once and run it everywhere,
[09:10.680 --> 09:14.080]  you have a larger audience and it's less work.
[09:15.880 --> 09:19.000]  It doesn't. It doesn't actually work out that way.
[09:19.000 --> 09:23.520]  Usually, I mean, in terms of actually just being able to write once and it's
[09:23.520 --> 09:31.040]  and the more you try to get your app to feel the way people expect it to
[09:31.040 --> 09:35.720]  on the platform it's running, the more special cases you have to add.
[09:35.720 --> 09:39.240]  And depending on how deep you go, all of a sudden you're supposed
[09:39.240 --> 09:42.000]  supposedly using this cross platform toolkit,
[09:42.000 --> 09:45.520]  but you've effectively got two forks or three forks,
[09:45.520 --> 09:47.680]  depending on how many platforms anyway.
[09:47.680 --> 09:53.360]  But the thing that gets lost in that is if you go the native route
[09:53.360 --> 09:55.960]  and you really do depend on the native frameworks,
[09:55.960 --> 10:02.880]  whether it's Android or iOS or the Mac or Windows is the benefits are
[10:03.360 --> 10:06.080]  they're less certainly less obvious to a lay person.
[10:06.240 --> 10:10.880]  But I think it's obvious.
[10:10.880 --> 10:12.320]  I mean, I've been around long enough.
[10:12.320 --> 10:19.520]  It's you end up prepared for the future in ways that you don't otherwise.
[10:20.560 --> 10:23.680]  Agreed. And as a designer, director, producer, whatever I am,
[10:23.680 --> 10:27.400]  like there are things when you're looking at cross platform libraries
[10:27.400 --> 10:30.120]  that you want it to have a certain whether it's an animation
[10:30.120 --> 10:33.360]  or a compatibility thing, whatever your hands are then tied,
[10:33.360 --> 10:36.280]  but you're doing it the wrong way for the sake of that efficiency.
[10:36.480 --> 10:39.280]  I will give you and your listeners a little rumor
[10:39.280 --> 10:41.360]  just to kind of also, again, validate what you said.
[10:41.360 --> 10:44.360]  But we're working on investigating.
[10:44.360 --> 10:48.200]  I should probably use the word so people don't do another platform.
[10:48.200 --> 10:51.840]  And that other platform, we've decided we want it to be native.
[10:51.840 --> 10:55.080]  We want it to be where it feels at home.
[10:55.320 --> 10:57.960]  The way we would make our products
[10:58.320 --> 11:00.880]  for that platform the best in breed they can be.
[11:00.880 --> 11:02.960]  And that investment is money.
[11:03.160 --> 11:05.680]  But we believe that pays off over time.
[11:06.600 --> 11:09.640]  Well, and I can speak as an adviser to them.
[11:09.640 --> 11:13.560]  The Telepath crew that's now making the app Wavelength.
[11:13.800 --> 11:17.680]  Great app, but which is in a space wavelength
[11:17.680 --> 11:20.240]  for those who don't haven't seen me linked to it occasionally.
[11:20.240 --> 11:21.840]  And they actually have a really cool
[11:21.840 --> 11:25.040]  A.I. feature that's actually it might have already shipped this week,
[11:25.040 --> 11:27.960]  but it probably by the time this podcast is out, it will be out
[11:28.280 --> 11:33.360]  where the months ago they added I'm way on a sidetrack here, Michael.
[11:33.360 --> 11:36.800]  But months ago, they added the ability to have A.I.
[11:36.800 --> 11:38.680]  bots in your chat rooms. Right.
[11:38.680 --> 11:44.200]  So Wavelength is like group chat, private group chat, but a cross between
[11:44.840 --> 11:50.560]  group chat in like messages or WhatsApp and something like Discord or Slack.
[11:51.080 --> 11:55.960]  But with true native iOS and a Mac app built on catalyst
[11:55.960 --> 12:00.640]  that is way, way better than just the iPad app running on the Mac.
[12:00.640 --> 12:02.600]  It's a really good catalyst.
[12:02.600 --> 12:05.520]  But anyway, the new feature is we added A.I.
[12:05.520 --> 12:09.400]  bots a while ago, and this week they're flipping a switch to let the A.I.
[12:09.400 --> 12:13.760]  bots access the Internet, which is sounds like, well, of course,
[12:13.760 --> 12:14.960]  they should be able to access the Internet,
[12:14.960 --> 12:17.920]  but almost nobody has that with these A.I. bots.
[12:17.920 --> 12:20.360]  So now if you're in a chat with an A.I. bot,
[12:20.920 --> 12:24.640]  you can ask for sports scores from yesterday.
[12:24.640 --> 12:28.880]  And instead of getting scores from whenever the training set was cut off
[12:28.880 --> 12:31.600]  in twenty twenty one, you get like yesterday's
[12:32.200 --> 12:34.680]  sports scores or news or something like that. It's really cool.
[12:34.680 --> 12:38.160]  But anyway, Wavelength to me, the reason I'm advising them
[12:38.160 --> 12:41.280]  is because I think it's so interesting that their apps are truly native,
[12:41.760 --> 12:45.760]  including and there's and the downside is all of the competing apps
[12:45.760 --> 12:50.680]  in that space run on iOS and Android and Mac and Windows.
[12:50.680 --> 12:53.960]  And Wavelength is only for Mac and only for iOS.
[12:53.960 --> 12:58.360]  But they've hired an engineer who's hard at work on an Android app.
[12:58.360 --> 13:01.600]  And the Android app is going to be just as native to Android
[13:01.600 --> 13:06.680]  as the iOS apps are for for iOS, which to me is the right way to do it.
[13:07.040 --> 13:12.960]  And it is it's an incredibly small team compared to so many other things like.
[13:12.960 --> 13:15.640]  So the idea that, oh, well, if you do separate code
[13:15.640 --> 13:18.360]  bases for everything, it just means you explode your headcount.
[13:18.920 --> 13:22.760]  All of these startups that have like these electron apps that are supposedly
[13:22.760 --> 13:26.480]  right once everywhere have these ridiculous headcounts of hundreds
[13:26.480 --> 13:27.840]  and hundreds of people.
[13:27.840 --> 13:31.080]  And because they need the headcounts to be able to maintain that code
[13:31.080 --> 13:33.920]  to give an resemblance of a native app, which the irony is,
[13:34.120 --> 13:36.600]  if you had really good experts working on the native app,
[13:36.600 --> 13:38.320]  you'd have less people with better apps.
[13:38.320 --> 13:40.840]  Yeah, it's funny you said the advisory thing.
[13:40.840 --> 13:42.240]  You know, I advise a lot of companies.
[13:42.240 --> 13:44.000]  I actually had just gotten a message.
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.280]  They were asking me what I thought of their app on Apple Vision Pro,
[13:47.280 --> 13:49.400]  like since I experienced it, how it would be.
[13:49.400 --> 13:51.360]  And I actually told them, I don't think it would work.
[13:51.360 --> 13:53.160]  And I explained my rationale.
[13:53.160 --> 13:56.480]  One of the things I do well as an advisor, and this probably is why I make good
[13:57.080 --> 14:00.000]  native apps, is not every app should be made.
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.200]  Not every experience is correct.
[14:02.400 --> 14:05.160]  And I think what I do best, it's like the Apple thing, more
[14:05.160 --> 14:07.480]  no's, thousands of no's for every yes.
[14:07.680 --> 14:10.520]  So I want it to be clear as we talk more about the Apple Vision Pro.
[14:10.840 --> 14:13.960]  Not every app should be on the Apple Vision Pro,
[14:14.240 --> 14:16.800]  but it definitely changes the game.
[14:16.800 --> 14:19.840]  So I'm just kind of saying that I love the advisory part of my job
[14:19.840 --> 14:22.320]  when I advise companies and I actually tell them, no,
[14:22.320 --> 14:24.200]  that wouldn't be a good experience or no,
[14:24.200 --> 14:26.920]  that wouldn't be a benefit to the user if you did that.
[14:27.480 --> 14:28.960]  I think we've gone through it.
[14:28.960 --> 14:32.520]  We've gone through that with each new major form factor.
[14:32.520 --> 14:36.360]  I would say the exception is, as always,
[14:36.360 --> 14:38.720]  and I was just writing about it separately this week.
[14:38.720 --> 14:44.760]  The iPad is the weirdest platform because it's the exception to everything.
[14:44.760 --> 14:47.600]  And again, I just had a big, long podcast with Jason Snow
[14:47.600 --> 14:48.400]  where we talked about it.
[14:48.400 --> 14:56.000]  But the fact that for some people, the iPad really just is a big ass iPhone
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.520]  means anything that is a good iPhone app should probably be optimized
[15:00.520 --> 15:01.880]  to run on the iPad, too.
[15:01.880 --> 15:07.120]  I mean, there's very few apps that I can think of that make sense
[15:07.440 --> 15:10.520]  on the iPhone that you would advise.
[15:10.520 --> 15:13.040]  Yeah, but it's not even worth it to do it for the iPad.
[15:13.040 --> 15:15.080]  I mean, I'm sure there's a few.
[15:15.080 --> 15:21.720]  My advice always is don't make an iPhone app into a big iPhone app on the iPad.
[15:21.840 --> 15:23.760]  It's take advantage of the iPad screen.
[15:23.760 --> 15:27.320]  Like when we brought fantastic out to the iPad, we didn't just take it and blow it up.
[15:27.320 --> 15:29.720]  We added the dashboard, which is a few different elements.
[15:29.880 --> 15:33.880]  And I think take advantage of that screen is where people miss the benefit of the iPad.
[15:34.080 --> 15:37.840]  That's screen real estate, which ironically dovetails into the Apple Vision Pro.
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.240]  It's that screen potential that makes your app potential better.
[15:42.240 --> 15:47.600]  Yeah, but iPad aside, when there's a new platform, it is a question like.
[15:47.600 --> 15:50.840]  So when the iPhone first came out and developers
[15:50.840 --> 15:54.320]  and you were already a Mac developer at the time, I think fantastic out was
[15:54.560 --> 15:57.680]  did fantastic. I'll start before the iPhone even existed.
[15:57.920 --> 16:01.840]  When did you know? So we started the usually about 2010.
[16:01.880 --> 16:03.600]  OK, the iPhone already exists.
[16:03.600 --> 16:06.240]  Yeah. Which one? I don't know this.
[16:06.280 --> 16:09.520]  Where where did fantastic launch first Mac or iPhone?
[16:09.560 --> 16:11.160]  It launched on the Mac.
[16:11.160 --> 16:13.600]  And this will blow your mind because sometimes when I look back, I'm like,
[16:13.600 --> 16:17.920]  we did that. We launched as the menu bar only app. That's right.
[16:17.920 --> 16:22.520]  I mean, companion to ICAL and we didn't even have editing or deletion.
[16:22.520 --> 16:23.520]  We didn't have management.
[16:23.520 --> 16:26.760]  It was literally like add and view as a menu bar app.
[16:26.760 --> 16:29.120]  That is all it did. Well.
[16:30.480 --> 16:35.840]  All it did, but the the true the why the natural language, right?
[16:35.840 --> 16:40.160]  The natural language so that I can do, which I literally just did yesterday
[16:40.160 --> 16:44.360]  when we set this up, it's just type in TTS three, eight,
[16:44.360 --> 16:48.280]  four with Michael Simmons tomorrow, two thirty.
[16:48.600 --> 16:54.360]  And boom, there's my event with all everything just parsed out the right way
[16:54.360 --> 16:58.760]  so that there was a killer feature in fantastic. You're right.
[16:58.760 --> 17:01.240]  I remember that now is a menu bar app.
[17:01.240 --> 17:05.360]  And I remember writing about it, about how the that natural language
[17:05.360 --> 17:09.200]  input was words into the field and all that stuff.
[17:09.320 --> 17:10.800]  I mean, we were the O.G. of A.I.
[17:10.800 --> 17:13.160]  and I never really thought of myself that way, but everyone said it.
[17:13.160 --> 17:17.040]  So I guess I am like we were doing A.I. back in 2009, 2010,
[17:17.040 --> 17:20.080]  taking natural language and turning it into an output. Right. Right.
[17:20.080 --> 17:25.680]  And the key is the natural language where it wasn't like the Unix command line
[17:25.920 --> 17:30.760]  where you have to type the command in the exact right syntax
[17:30.760 --> 17:35.160]  in the exact right order or it won't work at all
[17:35.440 --> 17:38.160]  or you'll delete an entire folder of contents or something
[17:38.160 --> 17:40.520]  because of a misplaced asterisk or whatever.
[17:40.520 --> 17:45.480]  It's pretty much you can type the time first or type tomorrow or type Tuesday
[17:45.480 --> 17:51.000]  or July 4th and type 4th or something like that.
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.480]  And it's like, yeah, I understand what you mean.
[17:53.480 --> 17:56.000]  Yeah, we want it to be and we're continuing to work on that.
[17:56.000 --> 17:58.280]  And as you can imagine, there's a lot of stuff on the roadmap,
[17:58.600 --> 18:02.480]  especially the explosion of A.I., which is actually very exciting to all of us.
[18:02.480 --> 18:07.680]  But yeah, the goal of fantastic how will always be that it just works card hop as well.
[18:07.680 --> 18:09.160]  It should just work.
[18:09.160 --> 18:12.840]  But iPhone comes out and Mac developers are excited.
[18:12.840 --> 18:15.360]  Cocoa frameworks. It's familiar.
[18:15.360 --> 18:20.560]  They when they first released the SDK, every developer I know looked at it
[18:20.560 --> 18:25.160]  and they were like, oh, UI kit is like a new version of app kit.
[18:25.160 --> 18:27.360]  It's modernized in some ways.
[18:27.360 --> 18:28.880]  It's limited in some ways.
[18:28.880 --> 18:32.080]  It's missing, especially back in 2008,
[18:32.480 --> 18:38.920]  missing huge swaths of frameworks that app kit had because UI kit was a new
[18:38.920 --> 18:42.200]  and be meant for a three point five inch touch screen.
[18:42.680 --> 18:47.400]  But the bigger picture was, hey, just because you have a great Mac app,
[18:47.920 --> 18:51.040]  it might not make sense to do an iPhone app.
[18:51.320 --> 18:52.480]  Does it make sense?
[18:52.480 --> 18:54.840]  A lot of times it did. Sometimes it didn't.
[18:55.320 --> 18:57.280]  I think we definitely we went through that.
[18:57.880 --> 19:00.960]  I think we're still going through it with Apple Watch. Right.
[19:00.960 --> 19:04.560]  Where I think of all the platforms
[19:04.560 --> 19:09.000]  and I think it's just directly related to the size of the screen
[19:09.000 --> 19:12.240]  and how much interaction you can do with it.
[19:13.200 --> 19:18.400]  I'd say very few apps overall belong as native watch apps.
[19:18.960 --> 19:20.040]  It's I just doesn't.
[19:20.040 --> 19:22.040]  I concur with what I said earlier about Apple Vision Pro.
[19:22.040 --> 19:24.160]  Sometimes it just doesn't make sense to make an app.
[19:24.160 --> 19:26.840]  And you do you look at only Apple Watch apps that came out, John,
[19:26.840 --> 19:28.960]  and then got canceled or they remove them.
[19:28.960 --> 19:30.960]  Remember, there were a whole bunch that like they're like, oh,
[19:30.960 --> 19:33.400]  we're deprecating this app because it just didn't make sense.
[19:33.400 --> 19:36.280]  Hard to maintain, hard to support and no one cares.
[19:36.280 --> 19:39.560]  Yeah, it's the only platform I've ever used and I still use it.
[19:39.560 --> 19:43.600]  I have it on right now, but it's the only platform I've ever used
[19:43.600 --> 19:47.440]  where I've had fewer apps installed over time, not more,
[19:47.960 --> 19:50.040]  because over time they've started disappear.
[19:50.040 --> 19:54.040]  They've started disappearing because some developers
[19:54.040 --> 19:56.960]  that used to have a watch component were like, nobody uses it.
[19:56.960 --> 19:58.120]  This isn't worth it for us.
[19:58.120 --> 20:00.880]  And then they got rid of it and then the watch app just disappears.
[20:00.880 --> 20:05.440]  But anyway, now we're at that point for a brand new platform.
[20:05.920 --> 20:09.160]  Yes, it is.
[20:09.160 --> 20:12.680]  It's just an exciting time and it's like it.
[20:14.040 --> 20:16.760]  That's why I'm so excited to talk to you, because it's like me
[20:17.080 --> 20:23.240]  and a bunch of my media cohort friends who got the 30 minute demo at WWDC
[20:24.080 --> 20:26.520]  got the kibits about it with each other,
[20:26.520 --> 20:29.320]  and then we got to podcast and write about our experiences.
[20:29.320 --> 20:32.760]  But really, here we are at the very end of August.
[20:32.760 --> 20:36.560]  It's, you know, three months later and you're the first person
[20:36.560 --> 20:40.360]  I've been able to talk to since who's had a new experience with the Vision Grow.
[20:41.080 --> 20:43.680]  Well, in your demo, I'm sure was very corralled
[20:43.680 --> 20:46.360]  and steered in a certain direction, limited time.
[20:46.360 --> 20:47.840]  30 minute questions.
[20:47.840 --> 20:49.600]  Yep, there weren't many answers.
[20:49.600 --> 20:52.320]  I'm just saying like it's very contrived, very controlled.
[20:52.320 --> 20:54.200]  Yeah. Did you get a demo like that?
[20:54.200 --> 20:56.800]  Like a sort of look, we just want you to introduce to that,
[20:56.800 --> 21:00.320]  get introduced to the platform and experience some of the just built
[21:00.320 --> 21:05.800]  in features like the watching movies and seeing the dinosaur or something like that.
[21:06.520 --> 21:09.520]  No, the best part was know that they already kind of, I guess,
[21:09.520 --> 21:13.120]  assume that we had read the marketing material and knew all that. Right.
[21:13.360 --> 21:15.440]  So what was nice was I went in.
[21:15.440 --> 21:18.800]  All right. Everyone who knows me knows I get very excited when I'm excited
[21:18.800 --> 21:22.400]  and I'm typically excited because I only get excited about things I'm excited about.
[21:22.400 --> 21:26.080]  But when I don't like something or something's crap, I'm very blunt.
[21:26.080 --> 21:28.720]  Very blunt, very honest. And I just tell you it's crap.
[21:28.720 --> 21:29.760]  I'm not going to mince words.
[21:29.760 --> 21:33.640]  So I had very high expectations for this device on what you wrote.
[21:33.640 --> 21:36.960]  And Jason wrote and everyone wrote. I did. I had very high expectations.
[21:37.160 --> 21:41.440]  Obviously, Apple was really and has really been putting a lot of weight behind it.
[21:41.440 --> 21:43.600]  So my expectations were uber high.
[21:43.600 --> 21:45.440]  And I also want to say one other thing.
[21:45.440 --> 21:48.600]  I went in with my own preconceived notions
[21:48.600 --> 21:51.320]  and ideas of what it would do if I were designing it.
[21:51.480 --> 21:55.800]  So my bar was so high because I'm like, this thing's either the biggest gimmick
[21:55.800 --> 21:58.320]  and it's going to flop or it's going to hit these things
[21:58.320 --> 22:02.080]  that I think it should do that I hope Apple got right.
[22:02.240 --> 22:05.880]  So I'm just letting that out there because I'm going to I'm going to gush
[22:05.880 --> 22:08.640]  and be all excited about this device. And I want everyone to know.
[22:08.880 --> 22:13.000]  I went in with major expectations that it would not do what I expected it to do.
[22:14.000 --> 22:15.240]  I was going to take a break there,
[22:15.240 --> 22:19.240]  but I'm thinking I don't it's too much of a cliffhanger at the hype.
[22:19.240 --> 22:22.560]  You should take the break. You want to keep them tuned in. Let's do it.
[22:22.840 --> 22:24.200]  All right. Let's take a break here.
[22:24.200 --> 22:27.760]  And let me tell you about our exclusive sponsor
[22:27.760 --> 22:32.320]  for this very special episode of the show, our very good friends at Squarespace.
[22:33.160 --> 22:37.000]  Look, Squarespace is the all in one platform
[22:37.120 --> 22:42.440]  where you get to go to build your own presence on the web.
[22:43.200 --> 22:46.480]  Head to Squarespace dot com slash talk show,
[22:46.760 --> 22:50.480]  and you save 10 percent off your first purchase of a website
[22:50.480 --> 22:54.880]  or domain or a website and a domain using that code talk show.
[22:55.320 --> 23:00.480]  It is the best way to drag and drop WYSIWYG.
[23:00.480 --> 23:04.640]  What you see is what you get. Design your own website.
[23:04.640 --> 23:07.560]  They have a new thing they're calling the fluid engine.
[23:07.560 --> 23:11.640]  Squarespace has always the whole reason Squarespace exists
[23:11.640 --> 23:16.240]  is making it easy for people with no web development skills
[23:16.240 --> 23:22.480]  whatsoever to drag and drop build their own website right within the browser itself.
[23:22.880 --> 23:26.360]  They've always been good at it, but their next generation layout engine
[23:26.920 --> 23:28.760]  fluid engine is out.
[23:28.760 --> 23:32.600]  It is new and it is everything Squarespace has ever been good at.
[23:32.600 --> 23:36.720]  But even better, including first class mobile support
[23:36.720 --> 23:40.600]  so that you can do the actual design, the tweaking, editing,
[23:41.000 --> 23:44.040]  everything you can do on the desktop, you could do right on the phone
[23:44.040 --> 23:47.880]  to create your own Squarespace website, edit your Squarespace website.
[23:47.880 --> 23:49.920]  All of that. It is absolutely terrific.
[23:50.560 --> 23:53.640]  What kind of features can you add at Squarespace to a website?
[23:54.040 --> 23:55.160]  What can't you do?
[23:55.160 --> 23:58.320]  Online stores where you can sell products, online stores
[23:58.320 --> 24:02.000]  where you could sell software and stuff like that or digital goods.
[24:02.400 --> 24:06.560]  You could sell your time if you're like a consultant, flexible payments.
[24:06.560 --> 24:08.880]  They have everything you'd want in a payment system.
[24:08.880 --> 24:11.800]  PayPal and Apple Pay support, everything like that.
[24:11.800 --> 24:15.560]  They have flexible templates, so many templates to choose from.
[24:15.560 --> 24:19.720]  Literally award winning, not just making that up, but they've actually won awards
[24:19.720 --> 24:23.240]  for the number of and quality of the templates you get to choose from.
[24:23.560 --> 24:25.360]  Start with a template and tweak it.
[24:25.360 --> 24:26.920]  Start with a blank slate.
[24:26.920 --> 24:28.280]  Design your own website.
[24:28.280 --> 24:30.760]  If you've got the skills and the desire to do it that way.
[24:31.080 --> 24:33.880]  How host your own blog, host your own podcast,
[24:34.600 --> 24:38.320]  analytics built in everything you need to do for a website.
[24:38.320 --> 24:42.720]  For a website and for people who listen to this show, the sort of nerds.
[24:43.080 --> 24:44.280]  It's not just for you.
[24:44.280 --> 24:46.880]  It's for the people in your life who come to you for help.
[24:46.880 --> 24:49.400]  Like, hey, I need a new website for this.
[24:50.080 --> 24:51.320]  Send them to Squarespace.
[24:51.320 --> 24:53.360]  Give them my code if you want to.
[24:53.360 --> 24:54.360]  That'll help me out.
[24:54.360 --> 24:57.400]  Go to Squarespace dot com slash talk show.
[24:57.400 --> 25:00.360]  And again, you get a free trial, 30 days, no limits,
[25:00.360 --> 25:02.960]  no watermark on the site during the 30 day trial.
[25:03.400 --> 25:06.560]  And then at the end of that, you save 10% by going to Squarespace
[25:06.560 --> 25:09.240]  dot com slash talk show and using that code talk show.
[25:09.240 --> 25:13.920]  So my thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this very special
[25:14.600 --> 25:17.440]  vision OS developer lab episode of the talk show.
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.120]  All right. So did it meet your expectations?
[25:21.200 --> 25:23.160]  Well, cliffhanger over
[25:23.160 --> 25:26.800]  cliffhanger, long pause, drag it out, talk about other things,
[25:26.800 --> 25:28.080]  make people wait till the end.
[25:28.080 --> 25:29.800]  All right. I'll stop. I'll stop.
[25:29.800 --> 25:31.640]  So, yes, it did. And it exceeded them.
[25:31.640 --> 25:36.000]  And the truth is and God's honest truth is I really didn't
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.680]  think it would. I heard all the rumors and all the buzz
[25:38.680 --> 25:41.120]  and everything that Apple was doing this thing in AR and VR.
[25:41.120 --> 25:43.240]  And it's been going on forever and they'll release it some day.
[25:43.240 --> 25:46.360]  And then whether the rumors are true or not, oh, the commission,
[25:46.360 --> 25:48.960]  it's got to get shipped and they're rushing it out and it's terrible.
[25:49.080 --> 25:50.000]  And you're all these things.
[25:50.000 --> 25:53.800]  So I went in very much like, OK, this is going to be some complete flopper.
[25:53.800 --> 25:54.880]  It'll I don't know.
[25:54.880 --> 25:58.120]  It hit every check, every box I had in my head that I'm like,
[25:58.120 --> 26:00.960]  if it doesn't do this, I would never buy one.
[26:01.200 --> 26:03.400]  And it actually did more than I expected.
[26:03.400 --> 26:05.920]  All right, for example.
[26:05.920 --> 26:08.600]  So the first one was and I talked with lots of friends about this,
[26:08.600 --> 26:09.960]  you know, the dial, the crown.
[26:09.960 --> 26:11.360]  Yeah, it looks like the crown.
[26:11.360 --> 26:13.240]  I had said in my mind,
[26:13.240 --> 26:17.120]  I would bet they're going to use that to dial in and out of reality.
[26:17.120 --> 26:19.480]  I don't know why I had the idea, but I was correct.
[26:19.480 --> 26:20.760]  And that's how it works.
[26:20.760 --> 26:22.680]  So they showed this in the demos, I believe.
[26:22.680 --> 26:25.920]  So I'm going to be I'm going to try to talk as freely as I can.
[26:26.080 --> 26:28.640]  I don't think anything I'm going to say about my experience
[26:28.640 --> 26:30.440]  hasn't already been shown.
[26:30.440 --> 26:32.960]  So I'm talking about things that have already been shown.
[26:32.960 --> 26:34.400]  And honestly, there wasn't anything.
[26:34.400 --> 26:36.520]  I really think I saw that that wasn't that was new.
[26:36.520 --> 26:38.320]  So anything goes, but just be aware.
[26:38.320 --> 26:40.520]  I'm going to be a little cautious during this conversation,
[26:40.520 --> 26:43.600]  pleading, obviously, pleading, pleading the fifth.
[26:44.880 --> 26:47.600]  But yeah, so before I ever even had seen the device,
[26:47.600 --> 26:50.320]  even before you guys had seen it at the keynote,
[26:50.840 --> 26:53.880]  I just saw that crown and said, why would they have a dial on that?
[26:53.880 --> 26:54.720]  What would you dial?
[26:54.720 --> 26:57.440]  And I went in my mind, oh, my God, in and out of reality.
[26:57.440 --> 26:59.560]  And that's exactly how it works.
[26:59.560 --> 27:05.040]  You can dial in the amount of we'll call it screen versus vision.
[27:05.280 --> 27:08.320]  And what they've done with the optical illusions
[27:08.320 --> 27:11.120]  or whatever magic they have going inside of that thing
[27:11.360 --> 27:15.040]  that lets you see reality in real time without any lag,
[27:15.040 --> 27:17.160]  any jitter, any sort of like.
[27:18.480 --> 27:20.640]  I want to say like like like fakeness,
[27:20.800 --> 27:23.560]  you feel like you're in the real world wearing that thing.
[27:23.560 --> 27:27.880]  Yeah, you know, it's a screen and yeah, it's not exactly real vision,
[27:27.880 --> 27:31.200]  but it's so close, your brain just goes, yes, real.
[27:32.000 --> 27:33.280]  It's like the Arthur C.
[27:33.280 --> 27:38.080]  Clarke quote about what's indistinguishable from sufficiently
[27:38.080 --> 27:42.360]  advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
[27:42.760 --> 27:43.520]  That's correct.
[27:43.520 --> 27:45.880]  And that's what this is, because it's magic, right?
[27:45.880 --> 27:49.440]  It's you know, it's not 100 percent, but it feels 100 percent.
[27:49.680 --> 27:53.840]  And I did some of the meditations and some of those landscapes.
[27:54.160 --> 27:57.320]  And I just I could have sat there for hours. Right.
[27:57.320 --> 28:00.080]  And obviously I like to work. I like to talk. I like to do.
[28:00.080 --> 28:02.920]  I like to be. But it just put me in a mood.
[28:02.920 --> 28:04.040]  It really zen me out.
[28:04.040 --> 28:06.520]  I really believe even mental health purposes.
[28:06.840 --> 28:09.680]  That device is going to be a game changer.
[28:09.720 --> 28:11.880]  I felt it in just minutes.
[28:11.880 --> 28:13.960]  And I'm telling you, I'm predicting
[28:13.960 --> 28:16.320]  it is going to be a game changer for mental health.
[28:16.320 --> 28:17.920]  And that that's it. That's all I need.
[28:17.920 --> 28:19.480]  That alone did it for me.
[28:19.480 --> 28:24.600]  I do. And I even in a for lack of a better way of describing it,
[28:24.600 --> 28:30.280]  a lowercase m, lowercase h, mental health, like not in any sort of
[28:30.520 --> 28:35.000]  officially diagnosed with need of some sort of therapy
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.240]  or treatment or something like that.
[28:37.240 --> 28:40.560]  I kind of agree, you know, because I kind of feel like
[28:41.120 --> 28:45.320]  and again, without any sort of clinical diagnosis
[28:45.320 --> 28:50.720]  of having tension deficit disorder or ADHD or something like that.
[28:50.720 --> 28:56.400]  I think it's just the nature of our world that almost everybody at times
[28:56.400 --> 28:58.120]  has trouble concentrating. Right.
[28:58.120 --> 29:00.720]  Because the world is full of distractions. Right.
[29:00.720 --> 29:06.000]  And notifications are distractions and having multiple devices
[29:06.000 --> 29:10.080]  and your phone is buzzing or your watch is buzzing
[29:10.080 --> 29:12.360]  while you're using your laptop or something like that.
[29:12.360 --> 29:17.680]  I mean, I know that for the most part, your Apple devices do a lot of
[29:17.680 --> 29:21.560]  and I think the Apple does a good job of it, of figuring out, oh,
[29:21.680 --> 29:24.720]  your Mac is being used, we'll send the notifications there.
[29:24.720 --> 29:27.360]  We won't keep buzzing your wrist because you're doing it.
[29:27.360 --> 29:30.800]  But depending on how if you just got up, it's so just easy
[29:30.800 --> 29:34.320]  to get distracted in today's world and more so than ever before.
[29:34.600 --> 29:38.640]  And I do feel that the nature of VisionOS, because it's all encompassing,
[29:38.880 --> 29:42.160]  it's the most helpful concept
[29:42.160 --> 29:45.840]  for personal computing to get into the zone.
[29:45.840 --> 29:51.040]  I think. And I appreciate the lowercase MH assist, because, yes,
[29:51.040 --> 29:52.400]  that's what I was talking about.
[29:52.400 --> 29:55.120]  I'm talking about the fact that you and I, other developers,
[29:55.120 --> 29:59.280]  just everyone who's busy in the world without very serious mental health issues.
[29:59.280 --> 30:02.320]  And maybe it will still have applications there, because I still believe it does.
[30:02.320 --> 30:04.240]  I think it will put you in the environment.
[30:04.240 --> 30:07.920]  But yeah, just what I was saying was the stress of our day to be able to take
[30:07.920 --> 30:12.160]  a 20 minute session and meditate or just zone out into a different environment
[30:12.160 --> 30:14.240]  where your notifications don't come in.
[30:14.240 --> 30:16.000]  I think it's going to be very healthy.
[30:16.000 --> 30:18.400]  And that alone was very inspiring to me.
[30:18.400 --> 30:21.040]  I can't. It almost changed me after doing.
[30:21.040 --> 30:22.720]  I just sat there for a few minutes doing it.
[30:22.720 --> 30:28.080]  And I was like, wow, to take it to the opposite end of the
[30:28.720 --> 30:33.520]  all encompassing spectrum to compare to Apple Watch, which added like
[30:33.840 --> 30:36.320]  I think they call it meditation or whatever they call it.
[30:36.320 --> 30:40.080]  But there's like an app that you can do on your Apple, focus
[30:41.040 --> 30:43.360]  or breathe. Maybe they call it.
[30:43.360 --> 30:46.240]  Maybe it's free. Yeah, I'm sure some people are using it.
[30:46.240 --> 30:48.800]  I don't want to I guess the app's not called Breathe, but
[30:49.520 --> 30:51.600]  well, it changed because they added some more features to it.
[30:51.600 --> 30:52.640]  It used to just be breathing.
[30:52.640 --> 30:54.880]  I think they added some other ones, but I know what you're.
[30:54.880 --> 30:58.160]  But and I think the idea for people who get good use out of it
[30:58.160 --> 31:02.800]  is that you go to a quiet room, sit down, close your eyes
[31:02.800 --> 31:06.080]  or turn out the lights or sit in a room without distractions
[31:06.080 --> 31:10.560]  and then let the vibrations of the watch guide your breathing or something like that.
[31:10.560 --> 31:14.720]  But it's just a little tiny dingus on your wrist.
[31:16.160 --> 31:19.280]  You've got to go somewhere and find the quiet room
[31:19.280 --> 31:22.880]  and you've got to go somewhere and find the space or close your eyes,
[31:22.880 --> 31:26.400]  whereas vision, putting on a vision headset.
[31:26.400 --> 31:30.000]  And obviously the first one's called Vision Pro in future years.
[31:30.000 --> 31:32.800]  It's very obvious, starting with one called Pro, that there will be,
[31:33.360 --> 31:37.280]  I guess, if I had to guess something called a vision air,
[31:37.280 --> 31:41.200]  which would be lower priced and more therefore more accessible
[31:41.200 --> 31:42.480]  at a price point to more people.
[31:43.280 --> 31:47.200]  So just calling them vision headsets, which I think is very obviously
[31:47.200 --> 31:50.240]  going to happen within two or three years from now.
[31:51.200 --> 31:56.160]  It can put you, instead of you putting yourself into a quiet place,
[31:56.160 --> 32:00.800]  it'll put you into a quiet place and you can dial in your favorite setting.
[32:00.800 --> 32:04.320]  I mean, some of the places I got to see in my demo back in June
[32:04.320 --> 32:08.160]  were like the side of a lake. There was a mountain top,
[32:08.160 --> 32:12.320]  like a seriously high mountain top, where it's like you could look down at your feet
[32:12.320 --> 32:14.000]  and it's like you're looking over a cliff,
[32:14.000 --> 32:17.440]  which was realistic enough to make my palm start to sweat.
[32:17.440 --> 32:20.320]  You could be in anywhere. You could be on an airplane.
[32:20.320 --> 32:27.600]  You could be in a noisy train station waiting for your train and just zone out.
[32:27.600 --> 32:30.880]  And you've got a whole hour to wait for your train or something like that.
[32:30.880 --> 32:34.880]  And instead of looking at this hustle and bustle of Penn Station
[32:34.880 --> 32:38.560]  or 30th Street Station here in Philadelphia,
[32:38.560 --> 32:41.920]  you could just be at Lakeside working,
[32:41.920 --> 32:44.000]  even if you're just catching up on email,
[32:44.000 --> 32:47.360]  like it honestly seems almost like the only downside
[32:47.360 --> 32:49.040]  would be risking missing your train.
[32:51.040 --> 32:53.360]  That's the thing is this thing is so encompassing
[32:53.360 --> 32:56.640]  that you will lose time and track of the real world.
[32:56.640 --> 32:58.560]  If anyone from Apple is listening, by the way,
[32:58.560 --> 33:01.760]  it's a dial in and out reality. They need to do something with
[33:01.760 --> 33:04.400]  I don't know if you remember in the 60s, Timothy Leary would say,
[33:04.400 --> 33:05.920]  turn on, tune in and drop out.
[33:06.640 --> 33:09.280]  There's something there with the Apple Vision Pro,
[33:09.280 --> 33:11.840]  except it doesn't require you to take drugs.
[33:11.840 --> 33:15.360]  And it just feels so relaxing.
[33:15.360 --> 33:18.400]  And then you can just dial out and you're back in the real world.
[33:18.400 --> 33:22.240]  Yeah, I do remember, too, the dial definitely is
[33:23.520 --> 33:26.080]  I guess I can't say that I predicted it in advance,
[33:26.080 --> 33:30.640]  but having tried it just briefly, it is like very natural.
[33:30.640 --> 33:34.240]  It is like, oh, I want to completely black out,
[33:35.440 --> 33:38.240]  not black it out because you can choose what it is
[33:38.240 --> 33:42.000]  you're looking at, a mountaintop, a austere room,
[33:42.000 --> 33:44.560]  whatever you want to see, but then just dial it
[33:44.560 --> 33:46.960]  and then you could just switch to, oh, no,
[33:46.960 --> 33:50.960]  I'm actually looking at the actual real world around me,
[33:50.960 --> 33:54.560]  but I've got these windows from apps in front of me
[33:54.560 --> 33:57.120]  that I can move around and resize and do.
[33:57.120 --> 33:58.720]  Yeah, since you and I have experienced it,
[33:58.720 --> 34:00.480]  I think your listeners will totally,
[34:01.760 --> 34:03.760]  they're kind of trying to estimate what we're saying,
[34:03.760 --> 34:08.000]  but you can truly dial in or out the level of reality
[34:08.000 --> 34:09.360]  to the virtual.
[34:09.360 --> 34:12.000]  And you can keep, let's say, your peripheral vision
[34:12.560 --> 34:15.200]  partially showing reality, but only the front of you,
[34:15.200 --> 34:17.360]  or you can do it a little less and have that theater mode.
[34:17.360 --> 34:21.040]  You can literally control the amount of reality to virtual.
[34:21.040 --> 34:23.680]  And I find that that really was what I predicted
[34:23.680 --> 34:25.920]  because I said, there's gotta be a way,
[34:25.920 --> 34:28.240]  Apple keeps talking about VR AR,
[34:28.240 --> 34:30.400]  and how do you marry those technologies?
[34:30.400 --> 34:33.520]  Well, the way you do it is you dial in how much of each one
[34:33.520 --> 34:35.120]  is beneficial at that time.
[34:35.120 --> 34:37.200]  When you're looking at actual,
[34:37.200 --> 34:39.680]  when you were looking at actual reality,
[34:39.680 --> 34:43.600]  the actual real world around you while wearing Vision Pro,
[34:43.600 --> 34:46.800]  did you find that the field of view,
[34:46.800 --> 34:49.840]  like how wide angle, how telephoto
[34:49.840 --> 34:53.680]  exactly matched your natural vision?
[34:53.680 --> 34:56.640]  I probably, I didn't think about it,
[34:56.640 --> 34:58.000]  but now that you bring that up,
[34:58.000 --> 35:01.760]  I'd say maybe some amount of my peripheral, very little,
[35:01.760 --> 35:03.760]  I would say it was probably insignificant enough
[35:03.760 --> 35:05.600]  because I can't say yes for sure.
[35:05.600 --> 35:07.920]  Yes, it probably was clipped a little,
[35:07.920 --> 35:10.960]  but I think on a normal day-to-day basis,
[35:10.960 --> 35:12.160]  something's in your peripheral,
[35:12.160 --> 35:13.760]  but it doesn't really matter, right?
[35:13.760 --> 35:16.480]  Like you could say, yeah, but I actually,
[35:16.480 --> 35:17.280]  it's funny you said that.
[35:17.280 --> 35:18.880]  I didn't think about that until now you said it.
[35:18.880 --> 35:21.440]  I could not with 100% certainty say it's the same.
[35:21.440 --> 35:23.280]  I think I'd almost by memory say
[35:23.280 --> 35:25.680]  it was missing a bit of peripheral vision.
[35:25.680 --> 35:28.080]  I think it probably depends on some person's vision,
[35:28.080 --> 35:29.680]  maybe even depends on the size,
[35:29.680 --> 35:31.760]  the sort of shape of your face.
[35:31.760 --> 35:33.680]  I know that Eli Patel,
[35:33.680 --> 35:35.920]  I think had the same takeaway you did
[35:35.920 --> 35:39.920]  that at the far edges of his peripheral vision,
[35:39.920 --> 35:41.440]  it seemed like it wasn't there.
[35:41.440 --> 35:42.480]  I didn't notice that,
[35:42.480 --> 35:46.000]  but maybe my eyes being a little bit more janked, it's off.
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.160]  But what I did see and what everybody,
[35:48.160 --> 35:50.800]  I know who's tried it has agreed,
[35:50.800 --> 35:56.560]  is what you do see is exactly like your natural vision,
[35:56.560 --> 35:59.760]  like looking through plastic safety goggles.
[35:59.760 --> 36:03.520]  It's not any more wide angle, any more fisheye,
[36:03.520 --> 36:04.880]  any more telephoto.
[36:04.880 --> 36:06.480]  So like if you lift it up
[36:06.480 --> 36:08.800]  and you're looking just unaided through your eyes
[36:08.800 --> 36:10.000]  and then you put it back down,
[36:11.040 --> 36:14.560]  everything is the same size, same place,
[36:14.560 --> 36:18.640]  and there's absolutely no difficulty
[36:18.640 --> 36:22.400]  with fine motor movement of your hands.
[36:22.400 --> 36:24.320]  If you wanted to pick up a pin,
[36:25.360 --> 36:27.280]  a real life pin in front of you,
[36:27.280 --> 36:29.600]  you just look down and your fingers will,
[36:29.600 --> 36:33.280]  you won't be off by half an inch or something like that.
[36:34.000 --> 36:35.920]  It's like looking through safety glasses.
[36:35.920 --> 36:37.680]  You can tell you're looking through something.
[36:37.680 --> 36:39.360]  It's not magically,
[36:39.360 --> 36:39.920]  agreed.
[36:39.920 --> 36:42.000]  But in the same way that when you wear,
[36:42.000 --> 36:45.040]  like in a high school or college chemistry lab
[36:45.040 --> 36:45.840]  or something like that,
[36:45.840 --> 36:48.880]  and you just put safety glasses on top of your eyes,
[36:49.680 --> 36:52.160]  you don't see the frame because they're clear
[36:52.160 --> 36:54.000]  and they're bigger than eyeglasses,
[36:54.000 --> 36:55.920]  but you know you're looking through something.
[36:55.920 --> 36:56.640]  You just can tell.
[36:56.640 --> 36:57.760]  That's just how it is.
[36:57.760 --> 37:02.480]  But the fact that it's just a completely natural field of view
[37:02.480 --> 37:06.720]  is I think totally key because you can,
[37:07.360 --> 37:10.640]  when you're dialed out and you are including reality
[37:10.640 --> 37:13.200]  in what you see, you have no problem with it.
[37:13.200 --> 37:16.080]  I wasn't on stage,
[37:16.080 --> 37:18.080]  but I don't think I'm speaking out of turn,
[37:18.080 --> 37:20.160]  but talking to Mike Rockwell,
[37:20.160 --> 37:22.000]  I think before my show or but whatever,
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.960]  it was off stage at WWDC.
[37:24.960 --> 37:27.520]  He had mentioned that just to test that,
[37:27.520 --> 37:29.760]  to test the latency and the real world
[37:30.320 --> 37:33.520]  that they've played ping pong while wearing it.
[37:33.520 --> 37:35.040]  And so I think that's interesting.
[37:35.040 --> 37:36.000]  And that you totally can.
[37:36.000 --> 37:37.200]  Now I'm sure that like,
[37:37.200 --> 37:40.720]  if you're like a serious ass competitive ping pong player,
[37:40.720 --> 37:41.600]  no, you can't.
[37:41.600 --> 37:45.920]  The actual like whatever 12 milliseconds of latency
[37:45.920 --> 37:49.280]  would kill you playing high end competitive table.
[37:49.280 --> 37:52.640]  But for like casual, normal people fun,
[37:52.640 --> 37:55.920]  you could play table tennis and you're not going to be like,
[37:55.920 --> 37:58.560]  I would have thought even with Apple's headset,
[37:59.200 --> 38:00.800]  no matter how good it is,
[38:00.800 --> 38:03.120]  if you tried playing ping pong or something like that,
[38:03.120 --> 38:05.120]  you'd be swinging and missing at the ball.
[38:05.120 --> 38:07.680]  You'd be a fraction of a second too late.
[38:07.680 --> 38:10.800]  Your hand, your coordination would be a fraction
[38:10.800 --> 38:12.320]  of a degree off.
[38:12.320 --> 38:14.000]  And you'd be, you'd look like an idiot,
[38:14.000 --> 38:18.080]  like a kid playing ping pinata spun around and dizzy.
[38:18.080 --> 38:20.240]  But no, you could just sit there and play ping pong.
[38:20.240 --> 38:22.800]  You can do fine motor skills, like picking up things.
[38:22.800 --> 38:23.840]  It's really uncanny.
[38:24.640 --> 38:25.600]  It really is uncanny.
[38:25.600 --> 38:26.720]  And uncanny is a perfect term
[38:26.720 --> 38:28.240]  because we always talk about uncanny valley.
[38:28.240 --> 38:29.280]  This is uncanny.
[38:29.280 --> 38:29.760]  Yeah.
[38:29.760 --> 38:33.600]  So you, I presume before you went there and again,
[38:33.600 --> 38:34.800]  plead the faith if you need to.
[38:34.800 --> 38:38.400]  But I presume that before you went to the lab,
[38:38.400 --> 38:39.760]  cause you had to apply, right?
[38:39.760 --> 38:41.680]  It wasn't like Apple came to your house
[38:41.680 --> 38:43.840]  and put a bag over your head and you woke up.
[38:43.840 --> 38:44.340]  No, no, no.
[38:44.880 --> 38:45.040]  Yeah.
[38:45.040 --> 38:45.920]  This was a process.
[38:45.920 --> 38:47.840]  This was a process everyone else is doing.
[38:47.840 --> 38:48.560]  That's correct.
[38:48.560 --> 38:51.920]  But you got, you probably showed up with a build
[38:51.920 --> 38:53.600]  because again, this isn't top secret.
[38:53.600 --> 38:56.720]  Now that Apple's announced it at WWDC,
[38:56.720 --> 38:59.040]  developers can just include it with Xcode.
[38:59.040 --> 39:01.680]  You can just download the vision OS SDK
[39:01.680 --> 39:05.760]  and start building and running native vision OS apps
[39:05.760 --> 39:07.920]  and run them in a simulator.
[39:07.920 --> 39:11.280]  And of all the ways that running apps in a simulator
[39:11.280 --> 39:14.160]  is always not the same as running it for real,
[39:14.160 --> 39:18.000]  like running it for a VR headset.
[39:18.000 --> 39:18.720]  Yes, it is.
[39:18.720 --> 39:20.880]  It is an approximation,
[39:20.880 --> 39:24.640]  but I'm assuming you showed up with like a build of software
[39:24.640 --> 39:27.120]  that was already compiling for vision OS.
[39:27.840 --> 39:29.040]  Well, this is where it's awkward.
[39:29.040 --> 39:30.960]  Cause usually as an Apple developer,
[39:30.960 --> 39:32.160]  an Apple developer and everything,
[39:32.160 --> 39:34.480]  like you don't talk about things before you ship.
[39:34.480 --> 39:35.280]  So to say, Oh yeah,
[39:35.280 --> 39:37.520]  we have an app in development for vision OS,
[39:37.520 --> 39:38.560]  but you know, yeah,
[39:38.560 --> 39:40.480]  we have an app in development for vision OS.
[39:40.480 --> 39:41.920]  So the goal was like,
[39:41.920 --> 39:43.600]  okay, we saw the device, the keynote.
[39:43.600 --> 39:43.840]  Okay.
[39:43.840 --> 39:44.480]  We're excited.
[39:44.480 --> 39:44.720]  Okay.
[39:44.720 --> 39:45.680]  They released the tools.
[39:45.680 --> 39:45.920]  Okay.
[39:45.920 --> 39:48.240]  We're going to start sketching.
[39:48.240 --> 39:50.400]  And I had these harebrained ideas as I always do.
[39:50.400 --> 39:51.840]  And then we just start going and going.
[39:51.840 --> 39:52.880]  And then all of a sudden it's like,
[39:52.880 --> 39:53.680]  Oh, all right, great.
[39:53.680 --> 39:54.640]  It works in the simulator.
[39:54.640 --> 39:56.400]  What does it feel like on the device?
[39:56.400 --> 39:58.160]  And by using it on the device,
[39:58.160 --> 40:00.080]  we change things because remember,
[40:00.080 --> 40:01.600]  we were estimating,
[40:01.600 --> 40:02.640]  will it be this fast?
[40:02.640 --> 40:03.760]  Will it actually work?
[40:03.760 --> 40:04.640]  What will you see?
[40:04.640 --> 40:06.240]  How much like we,
[40:06.240 --> 40:08.240]  we tried to develop it for best case scenarios.
[40:08.240 --> 40:09.120]  And what was crazy,
[40:09.120 --> 40:12.000]  John is it was better than we thought it would be.
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.520]  So we were able to then do even crazier things with our designs.
[40:15.520 --> 40:16.000]  Cause we're like,
[40:16.000 --> 40:17.200]  Oh, you can do that.
[40:17.200 --> 40:18.320]  Oh, you can do this.
[40:18.320 --> 40:21.120]  So it really was nice to prove it on the device.
[40:21.120 --> 40:22.720]  That was really the point of this lab.
[40:22.720 --> 40:25.280]  It wasn't obviously to get a free demo of an Apple vision pro,
[40:25.280 --> 40:26.560]  which was a great by-product,
[40:26.560 --> 40:30.160]  but the goal here was to develop, improve,
[40:30.160 --> 40:33.040]  and get a chance to use our app on the device.
[40:33.040 --> 40:33.520]  Yeah.
[40:33.520 --> 40:40.000]  One of the downsides of the demo that I got was because it was this guided tour from Apple,
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.640]  which primarily it wasn't really to show it off.
[40:42.640 --> 40:45.360]  It really was to sort of give people,
[40:45.360 --> 40:49.440]  whether they're writers like me or YouTubers who could then go on and describe it,
[40:49.440 --> 40:50.320]  they couldn't show it.
[40:50.320 --> 40:51.840]  They couldn't film their experience,
[40:51.840 --> 40:53.920]  but then they could go on YouTube and describe it.
[40:53.920 --> 40:57.520]  It's just convey to try to convey to people the experience,
[40:57.520 --> 41:01.040]  which is a primer in a way on what the device was and what it would be.
[41:01.040 --> 41:01.360]  Right.
[41:01.360 --> 41:07.520]  But because I didn't get to like go off on my own and try things like go to the app store
[41:07.520 --> 41:10.720]  and download something a lot of time with this unit,
[41:10.720 --> 41:12.560]  which I you would feel differently if you did.
[41:12.560 --> 41:13.440]  And they showed it.
[41:13.440 --> 41:13.920]  And like you,
[41:13.920 --> 41:18.960]  you mentioned they showed fantastic Cal the iPad version of fantastic Cal running.
[41:18.960 --> 41:26.560]  And that's by default, like if we could all get vision pros tomorrow and have them at home
[41:26.560 --> 41:32.720]  and you have a vision pro headset at home, but the vision pro app store isn't out yet.
[41:32.720 --> 41:38.880]  You could download iPad apps from the app store and they will run the Apple showed this.
[41:38.880 --> 41:40.080]  They showed fantastic out.
[41:40.080 --> 41:48.960]  What's your take on how much nicer it will be and how worth it will be to do a native vision
[41:48.960 --> 41:53.840]  OS app as opposed to just we've already got an iPad app that's good enough for now?
[41:54.560 --> 41:58.560]  Well, that's a great question, because I can tell you we got to use our iPad app
[41:58.560 --> 42:02.640]  natively on the Apple vision pro, and that looked great, worked great.
[42:02.640 --> 42:05.360]  In other words, we could just call it a day and be done.
[42:05.360 --> 42:09.680]  But as you know, we really want the best experiences and the best benefits for our users.
[42:09.680 --> 42:15.840]  So we have ideas due to the spatial development platform that Apple vision pro provides.
[42:15.840 --> 42:18.240]  And no, this is not like stuff I'm quoting from Apple.
[42:18.240 --> 42:20.240]  I really feel like since using it,
[42:20.240 --> 42:25.920]  that term spatial computing was perfect for my Apple to use, because like it said in some of my
[42:25.920 --> 42:30.560]  like I wrote in some of my quotes, like it really makes me think about it differently.
[42:30.560 --> 42:32.240]  There's no more borders on a screen.
[42:32.240 --> 42:35.920]  There's the real world and we want to make a real calendar in the real world.
[42:35.920 --> 42:37.840]  Well, okay, a calendar exists on paper.
[42:37.840 --> 42:40.560]  If you're going to use a paper calendar, why would you want to use a paper calendar
[42:40.560 --> 42:43.120]  on an Apple vision pro that doesn't make any sense.
[42:43.120 --> 42:44.800]  But what are things you could do?
[42:44.800 --> 42:47.920]  How could you envision your week ahead our day ticker?
[42:47.920 --> 42:49.360]  It's a little strip on iPhone.
[42:49.360 --> 42:50.640]  What if it was right in front of you?
[42:50.640 --> 42:53.120]  And as you look around, you can look at your week ahead,
[42:53.120 --> 42:56.400]  you could spatially feel how far away something is.
[42:57.040 --> 42:58.400]  There's even bigger ideas we have.
[42:58.400 --> 43:00.960]  But I want to give you those little ones to just have you realize,
[43:00.960 --> 43:06.320]  I was inspired by the fact that the screens are borderless, and it's a reality mix of
[43:06.320 --> 43:08.720]  your information and data and the real world.
[43:08.720 --> 43:12.320]  And what could you do with real world mixing with your data?
[43:12.320 --> 43:14.480]  There's a real lot of cool possibilities.
[43:14.480 --> 43:15.360]  And we're excited.
[43:15.360 --> 43:18.320]  I mean, really, we're excited, like, genuinely excited.
[43:19.920 --> 43:23.120]  The thing that made me think I was I'd said I saw your picture.
[43:23.840 --> 43:26.240]  When I realized it was you, I was excited.
[43:26.240 --> 43:29.280]  And I started thinking immediately I should get them on the show to talk about it.
[43:29.280 --> 43:32.560]  And then I read your quote were like, I could talk about this for two hours.
[43:32.560 --> 43:35.840]  And I was like, we're not going to go for two hours in the show.
[43:35.840 --> 43:37.120]  But what are we up to?
[43:37.120 --> 43:38.480]  I think we might go the two hours.
[43:40.160 --> 43:44.560]  But the thing that really I'm not surprised because I know you and I think about things
[43:44.560 --> 43:50.320]  alike, but that one of my major takeaways from my 30 minute experience was that takeaway
[43:50.320 --> 43:52.880]  of and I just didn't expect it going in.
[43:52.880 --> 43:59.840]  It just wasn't something that occurred to me was, oh, there's no more edge to the computing
[43:59.840 --> 44:00.720]  device, right?
[44:00.720 --> 44:06.400]  Like everything has always taken place within some sort of rectangle, right?
[44:06.400 --> 44:11.120]  And for most people, and I know you can have we've been able to have multiple display
[44:11.120 --> 44:13.520]  Macs since like the late 80s.
[44:13.520 --> 44:16.640]  You could put in another video card and have a second display.
[44:16.640 --> 44:22.960]  But even when you add a second display to a Mac or you set up your iPad with an external
[44:22.960 --> 44:26.400]  display, and now you've got the built in display and an external display.
[44:26.400 --> 44:31.120]  Now you've just got two rectangles where everything you do is within those rectangles.
[44:31.120 --> 44:35.680]  Like the frame of the display and we don't think about it.
[44:36.320 --> 44:43.600]  The framework of our computing paradigms and paradigm gets tossed around as a highfalutin
[44:43.600 --> 44:47.280]  word, but there's no other word that sometimes you need to say it.
[44:48.720 --> 44:50.800]  It disappears when you get used to it.
[44:50.800 --> 44:58.720]  And the old paradigms always infuse people's conceptions of the new ones, right?
[44:58.720 --> 45:00.080]  And now I'm not that old.
[45:00.080 --> 45:01.360]  You're not that old either.
[45:01.360 --> 45:07.440]  But there used to be a time when computing didn't even have live CRT displays, right?
[45:07.440 --> 45:13.200]  Like your computing was done on an actual paper teletype or punch cards, right?
[45:13.920 --> 45:14.800]  Oh, I know.
[45:14.800 --> 45:15.600]  Yeah, absolutely.
[45:15.600 --> 45:18.320]  It wasn't even a visual component, right?
[45:18.320 --> 45:28.160]  And nerds will remember that while text files are largely cross platform compatible, for
[45:28.160 --> 45:34.480]  bizarre reasons, in the 80s, there became three different standards for line endings.
[45:34.480 --> 45:42.000]  The Mac used a carriage return, which was ASCII, I forget, well, it's backslash R and
[45:42.000 --> 45:43.840]  C at the end of a line.
[45:43.840 --> 45:49.280]  Unix used a new line character, which I think is ASCII 10.
[45:49.280 --> 45:54.160]  One of them is ASCII 10, which is backslash N, and that meant end of a line.
[45:54.160 --> 45:59.280]  And Windows, of course, did the worst of all possible things and used a pair, carriage
[45:59.280 --> 46:01.920]  return and a line feed to end a line.
[46:02.480 --> 46:08.080]  But the reason Windows used carriage return line feed was that in the teletype days, when
[46:08.080 --> 46:13.040]  it was actually like a dot matrix thing going across a piece of paper with the, that was
[46:13.040 --> 46:18.560]  the only output, printing was the only output, it got to the end of the line and the carriage
[46:18.560 --> 46:23.760]  return moved the head back to the left and the new line rolled the paper up a line.
[46:23.760 --> 46:28.720]  So you needed a carriage return to take it from the right edge of the paper to the left
[46:28.720 --> 46:30.560]  and a new line to roll up a line.
[46:31.360 --> 46:38.160]  And when computing shifted from paper input on punch cards and paper output on teletypes
[46:38.160 --> 46:45.040]  to an actual interactive text-only display, it was just sort of replicating that on a
[46:45.040 --> 46:47.040]  screen and it seemed great, right?
[46:47.040 --> 46:52.000]  It was like, oh, now you can like backspace and you can erase stuff and you don't have
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  to waste all this paper and it's faster.
[46:54.560 --> 47:02.000]  But the paradigm of like an old Unix text terminal was just paper on screen scrolling
[47:02.000 --> 47:02.960]  up and down.
[47:02.960 --> 47:09.520]  And it just, the old paradigm infuses it and it just blew my mind with that experience
[47:09.520 --> 47:14.880]  that I've always thought of computing, just, I think about the edges of displays, but it
[47:14.880 --> 47:19.120]  just never occurred to me that we'd get to a platform where there are no edges to the
[47:19.120 --> 47:19.620]  displays.
[47:20.560 --> 47:24.160]  Yeah, one of the things that just hit me right away, and obviously it's because I'm a designer,
[47:24.160 --> 47:28.880]  this is what I do for a living, but I was taken back of the fact that I lost the borders,
[47:28.880 --> 47:30.480]  I lost the restrictions.
[47:30.480 --> 47:34.880]  It was as if I could create with my own hands, something in the real world.
[47:34.880 --> 47:38.480]  And what you said earlier, by the way, about the line space and all this other stuff, like
[47:38.480 --> 47:42.400]  I told you, someone reached out to me, a developer who wanted my input as an advisor about an
[47:42.400 --> 47:43.040]  app they're making.
[47:43.040 --> 47:46.240]  And I said, no, that wouldn't make sense because the thing that already exists in the
[47:46.240 --> 47:47.920]  real world is good enough.
[47:47.920 --> 47:52.000]  I think we have to be very careful when we have new paradigms like borderless screens
[47:52.000 --> 47:58.240]  or real reality elements to not just replicate what we have, not just make a calendar.
[47:58.240 --> 48:00.720]  Oh, look, I can hold up a calendar in the virtual world.
[48:00.720 --> 48:02.640]  Look how cool that doesn't serve a benefit.
[48:02.640 --> 48:03.680]  There are calendars.
[48:03.680 --> 48:08.480]  But when you really look at that canvas that's unlimited without borders, without bezels,
[48:08.480 --> 48:11.120]  like you said, multi monitors, but those still have borders.
[48:11.120 --> 48:13.200]  Those are still screens, discrete screens.
[48:13.200 --> 48:17.360]  And you think about where you can go with your eyes and the reality of the vision.
[48:18.240 --> 48:21.440]  There are lots of potentials on this medium, and I'm excited.
[48:21.440 --> 48:25.120]  I mean, I really do believe when this thing gets going, it'll be like the iPhone in the
[48:25.120 --> 48:25.760]  early days.
[48:25.760 --> 48:30.400]  There'll be some hokey things originally, some experiments, some playing around, whatever.
[48:30.400 --> 48:34.880]  And then I do think after a few years, once things get shaken out, we'll see some ideas
[48:34.880 --> 48:37.600]  that really will make computing into the next generation.
[48:37.600 --> 48:38.800]  I'm not it's not hyperbole.
[48:38.800 --> 48:39.920]  I really believe this.
[48:39.920 --> 48:42.960]  One of the friends I spoke to is somebody who works at Apple.
[48:42.960 --> 48:52.080]  So obviously spoke to me off the record, but someone who's work entailed developed working
[48:52.080 --> 48:58.960]  on some of the software that Apple already showed before WWDC after I never heard a peep
[48:58.960 --> 49:00.800]  from this person about it beforehand.
[49:00.800 --> 49:05.360]  But then once it was out and then they weren't spilling any secrets, they were telling me
[49:05.360 --> 49:11.040]  about their experience using it while they work at Apple and that they had this complaint
[49:11.040 --> 49:16.960]  that they felt like kind of crammed, like trying to do like email and web browsing and
[49:16.960 --> 49:18.880]  something else at the same time.
[49:18.880 --> 49:23.360]  And they just felt like, I don't know, all these windows are overlapping and this isn't
[49:23.360 --> 49:23.680]  great.
[49:23.680 --> 49:27.360]  And then one of their colleagues was like, figured out how they were doing it.
[49:27.360 --> 49:33.600]  And they were like, no, spread it all out, put it, fan it all out, like almost like or
[49:33.600 --> 49:40.720]  even up to 180 degrees around you and Apple's own video showing people using vision pros
[49:40.720 --> 49:42.400]  try to steer people that way.
[49:42.400 --> 49:48.720]  But my friend's idea was because even if you have like a nice big studio display or
[49:48.720 --> 49:54.640]  pro display XDR, you've got like this 30 some inch canvas, a rectangle right in front
[49:54.640 --> 49:56.800]  of you that you put all your windows on.
[49:56.800 --> 50:00.560]  Whereas this with vision pro, you don't have anything like that.
[50:00.560 --> 50:02.320]  You can just spread it all out.
[50:02.320 --> 50:06.240]  And all you do is just turn your head and turn your head to the left, turn it to the
[50:06.240 --> 50:14.240]  right, and you can just make use of an effective canvas that is way bigger than any actual
[50:14.240 --> 50:17.520]  display could feasibly be at any price.
[50:18.480 --> 50:23.440]  Perfectly said, the zoom tool on iPad or iPhone or even Mac, where you see the magnifying
[50:23.440 --> 50:26.960]  glass and you see what's within that magnifying glass zone to zoom.
[50:27.760 --> 50:31.920]  So we look at this whole display and we zoom on a specific thing.
[50:31.920 --> 50:35.120]  If you think of the Apple vision pro, what you just said, you can put things out of your
[50:35.120 --> 50:36.400]  field of view.
[50:36.400 --> 50:40.160]  You see what you have in front of you, but you can put things that are maybe less important
[50:40.160 --> 50:41.040]  off to the left.
[50:41.040 --> 50:44.160]  But then when you need it, you just turn your head to the left and they're there, but
[50:44.160 --> 50:45.600]  they're out of your main view.
[50:45.600 --> 50:46.480]  And it's incredible.
[50:46.480 --> 50:51.280]  Think of it almost like a display that you can just push things off to the side.
[50:51.280 --> 50:53.360]  But that's how the real world works, right?
[50:53.360 --> 50:57.680]  We put things in storage or in a closet or we put our clothes away and things like that.
[50:57.680 --> 51:01.920]  Just the way when the Macintosh made the desktop, a new paradigm of having things on your
[51:01.920 --> 51:05.200]  desktop, now you can have the real top.
[51:05.200 --> 51:05.520]  I don't know.
[51:05.520 --> 51:08.720]  Maybe I just coined a new phrase, but to me, it's like that.
[51:08.720 --> 51:10.240]  It's the reality desktop.
[51:10.240 --> 51:11.200]  It's the real top.
[51:11.200 --> 51:13.360]  It's where you're going with everything.
[51:13.360 --> 51:16.640]  It doesn't have to be in your current straight ahead field of vision.
[51:16.640 --> 51:17.760]  It can be off to the side.
[51:17.760 --> 51:19.920]  And then when you want it, turn your head and then it's there.
[51:19.920 --> 51:21.840]  And then you can even drag it and pull it over.
[51:22.400 --> 51:23.440]  You can manipulate.
[51:23.440 --> 51:24.640]  You can interact.
[51:24.640 --> 51:25.360]  It's really nice.
[51:26.080 --> 51:27.760]  I'm very excited, as you can tell.
[51:27.760 --> 51:32.480]  So one of the things that you seem excited about and it again, plead the fifth if you
[51:32.480 --> 51:32.960]  need to.
[51:32.960 --> 51:40.560]  But and I think it certainly was one of my concerns going in is you can easily everybody
[51:40.560 --> 51:44.560]  can imagine a VR headset used for entertainment purposes, right?
[51:44.560 --> 51:50.480]  Playing games and watching movies seems like, well, at the baseline, it has to be good for
[51:50.480 --> 51:51.680]  things like that.
[51:51.680 --> 51:56.880]  But is it going to be good for doing work, doing stuff like catching up on email?
[51:56.880 --> 52:04.720]  And reading stuff on the Web and whatever a calendar and whatever else I came away convinced.
[52:04.720 --> 52:05.680]  Yes, absolutely.
[52:05.680 --> 52:12.240]  This is it's not just like a gimmick like it, for example, to me, to be honest, if you're
[52:12.240 --> 52:17.680]  like you can get your email on your Apple Watch, but nobody is really looking forward
[52:17.680 --> 52:19.200]  to like first thing in the morning.
[52:19.200 --> 52:22.080]  Well, I got to catch up on all my email from from yesterday.
[52:22.080 --> 52:23.360]  I'm going to do it all on my watch.
[52:23.920 --> 52:24.160]  Right.
[52:24.720 --> 52:25.920]  Said nobody ever.
[52:25.920 --> 52:26.480]  Right.
[52:26.480 --> 52:32.480]  If in a pinch it's good and if you're the sort of person who either by personality or
[52:32.480 --> 52:38.160]  by job requirement needs to respond to emails ASAP, it's great to have it on your watch
[52:38.160 --> 52:39.440]  to get those notifications.
[52:39.440 --> 52:40.560]  But it's certainly nobody.
[52:40.560 --> 52:44.320]  But I honestly think Vision Pro isn't going to be like, yeah, technically, if you've already
[52:44.320 --> 52:47.600]  got it on and you need to do an email, you could do an email.
[52:47.600 --> 52:53.760]  But no, I think like putting one on and using it as like maybe your preferable way to do
[52:53.760 --> 52:57.600]  email would be we can do the typing thing is a question.
[52:57.600 --> 53:00.880]  Is that the onscreen versus a hardware keyboard?
[53:00.880 --> 53:04.800]  But certainly if you did actually have a great idea for that keyboard that I passed along,
[53:04.800 --> 53:06.560]  I don't know if they're really going to listen to me.
[53:06.560 --> 53:08.560]  I file the feedback as well.
[53:08.560 --> 53:13.040]  But I have an idea that I think could make the keyboard truly feel killer.
[53:13.040 --> 53:14.160]  We'll see if they listen to me.
[53:14.160 --> 53:15.600]  But I did submit that I did.
[53:15.600 --> 53:17.440]  I honestly did at the very least.
[53:17.440 --> 53:22.080]  So with a hardware keyboard traveling, I think this will be a great platform for productivity.
[53:22.080 --> 53:22.640]  Do you agree?
[53:22.640 --> 53:24.000]  I do.
[53:24.000 --> 53:27.440]  And one of the nice things I do want to say about Apple is they did point out that you
[53:27.440 --> 53:28.480]  should take breaks.
[53:28.480 --> 53:28.960]  It's in there.
[53:28.960 --> 53:30.160]  It's in their literature.
[53:30.160 --> 53:32.560]  It's not something you want to actually have on eight hours a day.
[53:32.560 --> 53:34.160]  And I think that has to do with the brain, right?
[53:34.160 --> 53:36.640]  You need to be able to there is a motion sensitivity to it.
[53:36.640 --> 53:37.360]  Did I get sick?
[53:37.360 --> 53:41.120]  No, but you did feel a little off, I guess.
[53:41.120 --> 53:44.400]  Is that probably I mean, I don't know how you felt, but you did feel like there was
[53:44.400 --> 53:47.920]  probably a little something going on with I don't want to say equilibrium or balance,
[53:47.920 --> 53:49.040]  but do you know where I'm coming from?
[53:49.040 --> 53:52.560]  I don't know if you could do that for eight hours straight with that on, because it's
[53:52.560 --> 53:54.240]  a little different from the real world.
[53:54.240 --> 53:55.920]  Do you get kind of what I'm saying?
[53:55.920 --> 54:00.320]  Yeah, well, I only got 30 minutes one time, but it was 30 straight minutes.
[54:00.320 --> 54:06.640]  But I kind of I just think I think it's inevitable because our brains didn't evolve
[54:06.640 --> 54:08.560]  to be in that in a world like that.
[54:08.560 --> 54:15.760]  And it might be the sort of thing that the more you use it, the longer you can go without
[54:15.760 --> 54:19.520]  any kind of strain or tedium involved with it.
[54:19.520 --> 54:24.320]  Battery life being the limiting factor if you're not connected to a power source while
[54:24.320 --> 54:25.440]  you're using it.
[54:25.440 --> 54:27.360]  But I'm certain I could have gone eight hours.
[54:27.360 --> 54:30.560]  I'm just saying I felt, you know, they said to take breaks and that it was healthy to
[54:30.560 --> 54:33.280]  take breaks, which I'm saying I appreciated that about them.
[54:33.280 --> 54:34.880]  They didn't say like, don't take breaks.
[54:34.880 --> 54:37.200]  But to answer your question, yes, it absolutely.
[54:37.200 --> 54:40.480]  So here's the reason why I think you could use it all day in a work environment or productivity
[54:40.480 --> 54:41.360]  environment.
[54:41.360 --> 54:46.960]  The thing they do with using it with a MacBook Pro and you stare at it and it spawns off
[54:46.960 --> 54:52.000]  extra displays in the augmented reality world where you can just have like four, we'll
[54:52.000 --> 54:57.600]  call them fake studio displays just on your desktop that are there but aren't really
[54:57.600 --> 54:58.080]  there, right?
[54:58.080 --> 55:01.520]  They're visual interpretations of huge displays.
[55:01.520 --> 55:04.080]  That alone is worth the price tag of the Apple Vision Pro.
[55:04.080 --> 55:10.080]  But that alone, you can continue to use your MacBook Pro with these displays and have all
[55:10.080 --> 55:12.640]  of the other Apple Vision Pro Vision OS goodies.
[55:13.280 --> 55:16.080]  You can work all day long and you're still using your Mac, right?
[55:16.080 --> 55:17.760]  It's your Mac's operating system.
[55:17.760 --> 55:19.760]  It's passing through your Mac, right?
[55:19.760 --> 55:23.280]  So that alone is going to boost productivity beyond anything.
[55:23.280 --> 55:27.200]  I mean, imagine just having four displays now by just opening your Mac and it works.
[55:27.200 --> 55:28.480]  Yeah, that's amazing.
[55:28.480 --> 55:30.080]  That's a killer feature right there.
[55:30.080 --> 55:31.120]  That's it.
[55:31.120 --> 55:32.240]  I think it really will be.
[55:32.240 --> 55:34.720]  And people are very skeptical.
[55:34.720 --> 55:38.720]  And I really do think it's, I hate to say it, but you have to try it.
[55:38.720 --> 55:42.720]  But I really do think there's an awful lot of people who are swearing up and down right
[55:42.720 --> 55:46.000]  now that it's never going to be good for anything other than entertainment who are
[55:46.000 --> 55:50.720]  going to be using one for work within the first year if they can get one.
[55:50.720 --> 55:54.480]  Because I think it's going to be backordered all year based on what I understand about
[55:54.480 --> 55:57.360]  the supply constraints on these displays.
[55:57.360 --> 55:59.040]  And they're going to be like, oh, yeah, I was wrong.
[55:59.840 --> 56:05.040]  You and I 100% can predict here with certainty that until you've used it, you don't understand
[56:05.040 --> 56:05.200]  it.
[56:05.200 --> 56:07.280]  And because if you don't understand it, you're skeptical.
[56:07.280 --> 56:09.040]  I was skeptical until I used it.
[56:09.040 --> 56:10.240]  I thought it would be cool.
[56:10.240 --> 56:11.600]  I'm like, there's got to be something here.
[56:11.600 --> 56:12.480]  It's Apple, right?
[56:12.480 --> 56:17.280]  But after using it, you just go, okay, is it expensive?
[56:17.280 --> 56:18.320]  Absolutely.
[56:18.320 --> 56:20.400]  Is it worth it for all of the things you're getting?
[56:20.400 --> 56:23.840]  Like just the displays alone could cost you $3,000, right?
[56:23.840 --> 56:26.480]  So if you use just that display feature alone, it's a home run.
[56:26.480 --> 56:27.600]  But I get it.
[56:27.600 --> 56:28.480]  It's first gen.
[56:28.480 --> 56:29.520]  It's pro.
[56:29.520 --> 56:31.200]  It's prototype, if you will.
[56:31.200 --> 56:35.520]  But I think the price is very, I will call it reasonable for what it is.
[56:36.240 --> 56:41.840]  One of the things and like I said about previous paradigms infusing our assumptions about
[56:41.840 --> 56:45.920]  the next one was for me after what is it now?
[56:45.920 --> 56:50.000]  15 years of iOS and direct manipulation.
[56:50.560 --> 56:57.120]  My instinct when I first put it on was when I'd see something to reach out with my finger
[56:57.120 --> 57:03.600]  and touch the actual thing, which kind of actually works, but it's not the way you're
[57:03.600 --> 57:04.640]  supposed to use it.
[57:04.640 --> 57:05.360]  I got to jump in.
[57:05.360 --> 57:08.880]  I did the same thing, John, because you expect, well, I could just manipulate it.
[57:08.880 --> 57:12.400]  But what you realize is you just keep your hands down and you move your hands at your
[57:12.400 --> 57:12.640]  side.
[57:12.640 --> 57:14.880]  Like it detects your hands.
[57:14.880 --> 57:16.400]  You don't need to put them in that place.
[57:16.400 --> 57:20.160]  It attracts your eye movement, what you're looking at and your hands.
[57:20.160 --> 57:21.680]  But I agree with you.
[57:21.680 --> 57:25.280]  But I think maybe they're doing that because it feels more natural to just look at it.
[57:25.280 --> 57:27.440]  Yeah, and I don't know the psychology behind that.
[57:27.440 --> 57:30.000]  I just I well, and I think it's a couple of factors.
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.560]  I think one is just we're just coming at it with the wrong assumption based on having
[57:34.560 --> 57:37.840]  used these actual things that you actually touch.
[57:37.840 --> 57:43.600]  And since you can't actually touch these things, you're never going to get when you
[57:43.600 --> 57:49.280]  actually touch a button on your iPhone, you feel your fingertip feels the glass.
[57:49.280 --> 57:54.080]  Putting aside the haptic feedback that you can get now for many things, just right back
[57:54.080 --> 57:58.240]  from the original iPhone with no haptics, your finger feels the glass.
[57:58.240 --> 58:02.480]  You're never going to feel glass when you or anything when you reach out and touch these
[58:02.480 --> 58:03.760]  virtual things.
[58:03.760 --> 58:05.680]  So I kind of think that's a wrong assumption.
[58:05.680 --> 58:12.240]  I think the other thing is that my recollection of what it was like is that one and one of
[58:12.240 --> 58:18.720]  the things I was surprised by was that the natural virtual distance from your eyes that
[58:18.720 --> 58:23.600]  these windows are in front of you is further out than I would have thought.
[58:23.600 --> 58:30.960]  It's I tend to sit in front of at my desk exactly arms reach like at any moment I could
[58:30.960 --> 58:37.840]  just put my arm out and my fingertips would touch my studio display if I ever were so
[58:37.840 --> 58:41.120]  gross as to actually touch my display, which I never do.
[58:41.120 --> 58:44.480]  But that's about how far I sit in front of a display.
[58:44.480 --> 58:47.600]  When I use a laptop, I'm obviously a little bit closer.
[58:47.600 --> 58:48.080]  Same.
[58:48.080 --> 58:52.800]  And when I use my phone or an iPad, my eyes are closer still.
[58:52.800 --> 58:58.880]  Whereas here, the virtual distance to this or the actual distance to the virtual windows
[58:58.880 --> 59:01.600]  is further than any display I've ever used.
[59:02.560 --> 59:05.120]  And it works because they can just make them bigger.
[59:05.120 --> 59:11.280]  So it's like much bigger windows than you would actually have on a display.
[59:11.280 --> 59:15.680]  And therefore, all the text and buttons and elements are bigger than they were.
[59:15.680 --> 59:23.840]  Everything is just bigger, but it's it doesn't feel kitty or Fisher Price style because you're
[59:23.840 --> 59:27.600]  still getting the same information density is like an iPad app.
[59:27.600 --> 59:32.480]  It's just so much bigger, but it's like, I don't know, like two meters in front of you.
[59:33.520 --> 59:34.320]  Yeah, exactly.
[59:34.320 --> 59:36.400]  And I agree with you, there was no hokeyness to it.
[59:36.400 --> 59:38.240]  The other thing that you'll laugh at.
[59:38.240 --> 59:42.240]  So we're working on our icon for our Vision Pro app because obviously we want it to be
[59:42.240 --> 59:43.120]  cool in the icons.
[59:43.120 --> 59:44.400]  As you know, we're three dimensional.
[59:44.400 --> 59:45.040]  They have depth.
[59:45.680 --> 59:48.720]  This thing was so real that at one point, I'm not kidding you.
[59:48.720 --> 59:54.560]  I would take my head and crane it around to see the side of the icon because your listeners
[59:54.560 --> 59:55.360]  may not know this.
[59:55.360 --> 59:56.480]  It's three dimensional.
[59:56.480 --> 01:00:00.880]  In other words, obviously, for it to be an illusion, you have to see three dimensions.
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:01.760]  It can't look flat.
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.960]  It doesn't look like an iPhone screen.
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.240]  It actually has depth.
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:07.760]  So I would literally train everyone in the room must have thought I look crazy, but I'd
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:11.840]  be craning around my head to look at the icon up and down and kind of zoom in and out.
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:14.640]  And we're playing with different attributes because I want it to look cool.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.960]  But I probably looked ridiculous.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:20.480]  But in my head, I was looking at the side of that icon.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:26.080]  I was moving the depth with just by moving around like it was a real icon in reality.
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.360]  And I thought that was pretty cool.
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:34.640]  I think one of the things and it's such a delicate balance and you and I have seen it.
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:38.880]  The balance swing back and forth over the decades.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:48.080]  But between just pure unadulterated making things look as cool as possible, even if it
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:52.880]  is just a calendar app or just a text editor or something like that.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:58.880]  But trying to make apps just like look in Steve Jobs's words, so good you can lick them.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:09.040]  It's part of the fun of being into Apple computers that has fueled my interest.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.800]  It's why I got into this whole racket.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:17.200]  And I remember in translucency, transparency has always been what used to be the Holy Grail.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.000]  Now it's part of it.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:26.560]  But I remember when in the early days of MP3 players, when our friends at Panic had Audion
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.840]  was their rival.
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:28.960]  Yes, right.
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:35.840]  There were two great sound jam MP, exactly sound jam MP and Audion.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.520]  And I'll put a link to in the show notes.
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:42.640]  Let me make a note right now to the Panic story about it where it's epic.
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.520]  It's excellent.
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:43.840]  All right.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:51.600]  But there were two great indie MP3 players for the Mac and Apple decided we should buy
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:52.560]  one of them.
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:53.920]  And they considered both.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:57.600]  It must have been a really hard decision because they were both excellent.
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.800]  Well, they wound up buying sound jam.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:07.040]  Jeff Robin, who was the lead person, is still at Apple today and still in charge of all
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:11.120]  of the same apps like the music and podcast and video apps and stuff like that.
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:14.880]  So lo, these 25 years later, he's still there.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:20.320]  But the Panic guys got a meeting with Steve Jobs where they got to hear the pitch for
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.360]  selling Audion to them.
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:26.480]  But one of the things that was amazing about Audion is Audion had these skins that you
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:30.160]  could develop, but you could have as many third party skins as you could get your hands
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:30.560]  on.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:35.840]  But you could make the windows transparent so you could see behind them, which was something
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:39.600]  that was not a feature in the classic Mac OS at all.
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.200]  And in fact, totally hacked, baked and epic.
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.000]  Right.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.800]  It was Panic co-founder Stephen Frank had to do all the programming at interrupt time,
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.840]  which is like the matrix.
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:58.400]  It's like in between the slices of time that a normal app could expect to have in between
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:03.920]  those slices of time was when Audion did the drawing so that it could figure out what would
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:06.560]  be behind the window if it weren't there.
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:10.880]  So we could draw what was behind the window to make it seem as though it was transparent.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:11.920]  It was amazing.
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.120]  And people were blown away.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.000]  And it was part of the fun.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.400]  I mean, of course, the whole point was to listen to music, but the skins were all about
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:24.720]  making it look as cool as possible for no utility reason at all, except that it made
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:25.520]  people happy.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.020]  Right.
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.240]  It was just cool.
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:28.880]  It was just cool.
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:30.880]  You know, and then we've gone back and forth.
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:35.920]  The first version of Aqua, I think, went overboard with the transparent effects and the pin
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:39.680]  striping and to the point where it made stuff hard to read.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:46.000]  And Apple, as they've experimented with making elements of the various platforms, transparent,
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.920]  translucent, whatever you want to call it over time, they've dialed it up, dialed it
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:50.420]  back.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:55.680]  It's never it seems like the end point of that is VisionOS, right?
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.000]  Like it is so cool looking.
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:04.400]  The interface for all the built in apps like Mail and Notes and Messages and whatever
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:08.880]  else, right colors and just popping and just feeling really feeling fun, right?
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.200]  Right.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.800]  Like, yeah, imaginative.
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:16.320]  And but with no detriment to legibility or readability that I saw, like it's like, oh,
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.560]  yeah, you know, very clear and crisp, right?
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:22.480]  Like the chrome of the window is like this frosted glass.
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:25.280]  And it's like just the again.
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:25.680]  So good.
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:29.120]  You you don't want to lick it because you don't want to put a stain on it, but it's
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.080]  like you want to touch it.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:34.800]  You wish I wish I could feel the frosting because you would feel like the nicest frosted
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:35.600]  glass possible.
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.680]  It would have that amazing texture.
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:42.000]  And back to fantastic how on VisionOS, that's the initial difference.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.400]  When you look at the native app versus the iPad app is we start to get that real chrome,
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:52.560]  that real look of the frostedness of the windows, you start to look more native, right?
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:57.680]  You really start to be able to take advantage of the three dimensional look, the reality
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:58.080]  look.
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:02.720]  So, yeah, I mean, there is a benefit to going, but not every app will benefit from being
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.560]  a reality app, to be honest.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:04.800]  Right.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:10.320]  But I think if it does, I really do think it's almost going to be an irresistible pull
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:14.800]  to go native just to have it look just to have it just to have it look good.
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.080]  Yeah, no, I don't disagree.
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:16.880]  I don't disagree.
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:20.160]  And the iPad apps running, I didn't get that's one.
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:23.680]  I think I said this, but one of the things I wish I'd gotten to try, but they didn't
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:30.320]  really show me like an unchanged iPad app just running.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.280]  I don't think they did.
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.600]  Or if they did, it's part of the demo.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.480]  I forgot.
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:38.720]  But I've seen their footage of it from the keynote and the other videos they have, and
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:40.000]  they don't look bad.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:47.120]  It's not like, for example, back 20 years ago when Mac OS X first came out, classic
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:52.800]  apps kind of looked bad because they didn't have the cool anti-aliasing or the transparency
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:06:00.960]  and as much as I have a great affinity for the Mac OS 9 pixel by pixel aesthetic, it
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:06.640]  just looked out of place in the middle of Aqua with all this anti-aliasing and the jellybean
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.760]  effects of all that.
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:12.480]  I was going to say the genie effects coming out, like the sheet, the file file sheet coming
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:14.640]  out of the little crack or whatever.
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:14.960]  Right.
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:16.720]  It just looked old and janky.
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:28.640]  And you get that, too, if you need to run Windows in a virtual PC or whatever other
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:35.840]  emulators there are now for running a virtual environment to get Windows on your Mac, you
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:40.400]  can kind of see like, oh, here's Windows running in a rectangle over here.
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:43.200]  The iPad apps on Vision OS, they look fine.
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:46.800]  They just don't look cool at all.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.480]  They look totally normal.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:53.440]  And if you need to use there's some app that you really love and depend upon and you get
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:59.280]  a vision pro early next year and you have to use the iPad version, it's fine and it
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:02.960]  doesn't look like outdated, but it doesn't look cool.
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:07.600]  Yeah, the best way of saying it is it just looks like an iPad window floating in front
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:16.640]  of you where the Vision OS windows, the native windows look like objects, Vision OS-y things,
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:16.960]  right?
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:21.440]  Like it just it is native is definitely going to be the way to go on that platform.
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:25.520]  But again, I hope people don't make it too hokey or just gimmicky.
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:25.840]  Yeah.
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:34.000]  Do you think there it's again, we might be towing up against the things you plead the
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:41.360]  fifth on, but do you feel like Apple is so far three months in doing a good job with
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:49.680]  the developer outreach to have the ecosystem as rich as it can be on day one whenever day
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:50.640]  one is next year?
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:54.160]  I mean, I won't plead the fifth because I would say yes.
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:59.520]  Like from my point of view as a developer, they had this event, they featured third party
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:03.520]  apps that were already compatible, which again, we were not involved with this or anything.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:07.360]  We just made great iPad apps as the other developers that were included.
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:11.920]  So that's nice because they're already thinking about apps that work from day one, even without
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:14.560]  work from the developers, which to me is also nice to customers, right?
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:18.880]  Because we buy an Apple Vision Pro, your apps will just work, but they've obviously been
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:23.760]  doing the labs and outreach and they have the simulator and they're updating the Vision
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:24.640]  OS version.
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:29.040]  There's clearly a lot of developer outreach to not have this be a device that comes out.
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:30.240]  We're surprised by it.
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:34.000]  And then we scramble dates, all that other stuff I have no clue.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.280]  Even if I did, I'd plead the fifth.
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:36.400]  But I'll just say, I don't know.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:39.920]  I mean, we have a rough idea of what Apple said publicly, you know, probably next year
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:41.120]  sometime or whatever.
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:46.480]  But we're certainly have enough lead time with everything that's going on with iOS 17
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:48.080]  and watch OS 10 and all that stuff.
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:54.400]  We're already busy enough, but now we also can intermix Apple Vision Pro and have that
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:56.080]  ready for whenever it's ready.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:59.040]  And again, it's very odd to be talking about future development here.
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:00.640]  But, you know, here we are.
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:06.880]  I got Rockwell to say it on stage at my show where I tried to tease out is next year is
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.520]  early next year or just like sometime.
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:09.760]  Right.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:10.320]  I remember.
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:11.840]  And he was like early next year.
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:15.680]  And I was like, OK, that's I was like that was a much better answer than I expected to
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:15.920]  get.
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:17.440]  That was great.
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:20.960]  And I do think with looking at if you read the tea leaves, right, they have these labs.
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.160]  They're really being serious.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.600]  They're pushing out this stuff.
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:26.400]  They're eventually with the development kits and all this other stuff.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:31.040]  You can see they really want to have this thing early next year.
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.080]  I don't know if it will be.
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:34.960]  We don't know about how supply chains and all the other stuff works, but why not?
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:36.080]  Why not early next year?
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:37.120]  That could work, right?
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:42.480]  Did you get to do anything like just entertainment wise, like watching movies, stuff like that?
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:43.200]  Yeah, I did.
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:45.920]  So I went into the movie app and I turned it into theater mode.
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:46.640]  And it's cool.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.760]  You could put where you're sitting in the theater, like where the reflection hits.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:50.720]  Yeah.
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.200]  And the audio is fantastic.
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:56.560]  Like the whole thing's like, I can't wait to get this frigging thing and just use it
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.040]  as a user.
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:57.680]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:00.320]  It's like skirting the line between developer and user.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.520]  And as a user, I'm giddy.
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:03.840]  Well, I'm just thinking about it.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:09.840]  And I know it's important work for some people is editing and creating movies and stuff like
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:10.160]  that.
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:15.280]  And one of the weird things about watching a real motion picture is that when it's in
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:21.600]  a theater, it's a different emotional experience to see a 60 foot screen in front of you and
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:28.320]  a close up that fills the screen with an actor's face when it's 60 feet tall in front of you
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:31.200]  is different than seeing it even on a TV.
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:35.600]  Even if you have the biggest TV that Best Buy sells and you have a nice seat in the
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:40.800]  middle of the couch in front of it, your brain knows that's only four feet tall.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.080]  It's not 60 feet tall.
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:46.400]  Whereas you put Vision Pro on and you can simulate a giant movie screen.
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:53.280]  So if you're a movie editor, you can edit a movie and while you're editing it, watch
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:58.400]  it in cinema size for emotional response.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:05.280]  And I really do think Apple is Apple and it's their culture.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:09.200]  But I really do think in this case, I think one of the knocks against them is that they
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:17.200]  can become insular and there's aspects of Apple where they have a we're the we're Apple
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:20.720]  and so what we're doing is the best and it's really kind of all you need.
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:26.240]  I mean, the fact that all the only watch faces you get on Apple Watch are the Apple designed
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:26.640]  ones.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.440]  And it's it's the mindset of we just want.
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:33.840]  Yes, if we opened it up to third parties, some of them would be cool, but a lot of them
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:34.560]  would be junk.
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:38.640]  We'd rather just make sure every single watch face is Apple designed.
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:42.320]  I think with Vision Pro, I really do get a sense.
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:46.320]  And I think that the way that they're doing these developer labs with people like you
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:49.920]  and David Smith, who's been on my show and everybody else who's going to them who we
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:54.960]  haven't even heard from, I think they are just as committed as we could possibly hope
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:12:02.480]  they would be to doing whatever they can to make the third party ecosystem as great as
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:03.440]  it can be for this thing.
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:06.320]  I agree completely.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:09.680]  I feel like also the other nice thing is that's why I said it's weird to be talking about
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:11.120]  an app that's in development.
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.040]  Normally we're confidential as is Apple.
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:21.200]  I think for once they change their their culture of not free releasing to be great at release.
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:22.880]  And that's very brave.
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:26.480]  I hate using this word, but I feel like it is brave because it kind of goes against the
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:29.920]  whole Apple history of secrecy and control.
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:34.960]  And they're being very communicative because they want this platform to be accepted by
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:37.040]  us developers rather than it come out.
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:41.600]  And we're like, we're not developing an app for a vision headset that just came out today.
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:42.320]  What the heck is that?
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:45.920]  It might be like eight months until we see the light, so to speak.
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:49.200]  So I kind of admire that they know this is a leap of faith.
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:50.800]  It is a big paradigm shift.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:51.920]  It is a big change.
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:55.680]  And they're asking us in a way, hey, you should really be making stuff.
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:56.160]  What do you need?
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.280]  How can we help you?
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.440]  I do feel like they're being very cooperative and helpful.
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:00.160]  And that's very nice.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:00.640]  That's great.
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:02.160]  That's what the ecosystem should be about.
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:06.800]  Tech is so focused on what's now, what's next.
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:10.080]  iPhones coming out in two weeks, but building things to last.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:13.360]  I mean, Jason Snell and I in the previous episode of the show, we're just talking about
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:16.320]  the fact that maybe the Mac is here forever, right?
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:18.080]  It's 40 years.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:22.000]  And next year will be 40 years of the Macintosh.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.640]  And it doesn't the Mac seems as invigorated as ever.
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:28.720]  Some of these platforms are here for lifetimes, right?
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.320]  I'll give you a visionary view on it.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:34.800]  So they're supporting that display with the whole continuity and everything with the Apple
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:35.520]  Vision Pro.
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:39.040]  If the Mac wasn't in the future, why would they spend all that time building displays
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.720]  for your Mac into a brand new device?
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:43.120]  I completely agree with that.
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.920]  We have the Mac around at least another five years.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:48.560]  And I say five years because tech moves quick.
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:50.160]  But five years is a long time.
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.440]  I think way longer than that.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:52.720]  I do as well.
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:53.600]  I think 20 years.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.600]  But I mean, five, I would put my life on it.
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:58.880]  You know, I mean, it's a guarantee they're not going anywhere for five years.
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:04.800]  But well, and then on the flip side is this Vision Pro is the first vision device.
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:12.960]  And if the vision platform has decades ahead of it right now, in the very near future,
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:17.520]  are we going to have regular looking eyeglasses that give you the Vision OS experience?
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:22.640]  No battery life, all of all sorts of technical reasons that that's not happening in the next
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:23.360]  five years.
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:23.860]  No way.
[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:27.620]  Eventually, though, it definitely is going to happen now.
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:28.100]  I don't know.
[01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:29.380]  Will it be contact lenses?
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:34.500]  Well, who knows what technical advances will happen in the next 20 years, but at some point
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:34.980]  that is.
[01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:41.940]  And that to me is to circle this back here as we wrap up to that use of the term welcome
[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:43.140]  to spatial computing.
[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:50.500]  That to me is part of the message, too, is I saw from my 30 minutes with it is, oh, this
[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:58.660]  paradigm looking through this is it has as much legs to future, much more unimaginable
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:03.780]  to me today, advanced ways of getting this experience with just a simple pair of glasses
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:08.980]  that I could wear all day in the same way that the nine inch black and white Macintosh.
[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:17.380]  You can draw a line from that device to today's much infinite, almost infinitely more powerful
[01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:24.420]  computers that still support the basic paradigm of that graphical user interface desktop.
[01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:31.380]  This spatial computing paradigm to me is like the initial frameworks for sketching out how
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:33.380]  these things are going to work for 20 years.
[01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:35.140]  I agree.
[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:36.500]  It's definitely a new platform.
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:37.540]  It's a new paradigm.
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:43.140]  And as I said, my quotes and I've told colleagues and people on my own team, it is spatial computing.
[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:44.500]  It is borderless computing.
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:47.140]  It is reality computing.
[01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:51.220]  And if people want to poo it or whatever, they're not seeing it.
[01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:51.780]  That's fine.
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:53.380]  That's in a way, sadly, they're lost.
[01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:55.860]  But this really is a paradigm change.
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:56.900]  We don't get to say that often.
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:16:02.100]  I feel like as we're getting older, you and I, John, this may be the last biggest change
[01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:03.540]  of our computing career.
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:04.340]  Maybe won't be.
[01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:05.460]  But this is a big change.
[01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:06.260]  I feel it.
[01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:07.220]  I feel it strongly.
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:11.300]  One of my favorite quotes, you never hear from this guy anymore.
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:12.420]  Remember John Dvorak?
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:14.100]  He was always the curmudgeon.
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:14.820]  Absolutely.
[01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:18.500]  He was the curmudgeon whose whole shtick was he was against everything.
[01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:22.660]  But I remember when the Mac first came out, I was only like 11 or something.
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:24.260]  So I didn't read it extemporaneously.
[01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:26.420]  But at some point I reread his column.
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:30.020]  I think he was at the San Francisco Examiner at the time as the tech columnist.
[01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:34.340]  And he said it had no future because you had to use a mouse to use the Macintosh.
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.900]  And there was no way to use it from the keyboard only.
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:42.020]  And every guy, and he definitely said guy, he knew when they worked at their desk, like
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:46.180]  to put their feet up on their desk and the keyboard on their lap and just have a keyboard
[01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:47.540]  and put their feet up on the desk.
[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:53.780]  And if you had to take your feet off the desk to go put your hand on the mouse, it was a
[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:54.660]  no go.
[01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:57.300]  How dare they not allow you to put your feet up on the desk.
[01:16:57.300 --> 01:16:57.540]  Right.
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:01.940]  But guys, at every step of the way, there have been naysayers who say the real computers
[01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:04.980]  are always going to be a command line only, not a GUI.
[01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:08.740]  And then when the iPhone came out, like, oh, it's fun, but it's a gimmick.
[01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:12.900]  Nobody's ever going to do all their computing on a touch screen without a keyboard and a
[01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:14.580]  mouse or something like that.
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:17.220]  It's exactly the same with this with spatial computing.
[01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:18.580]  I agree.
[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:22.820]  The comment whenever anyone says nobody will ever that automatically, maybe that should
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:23.620]  be the name of this episode.
[01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:24.100]  Nobody will ever.
[01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:28.020]  But once someone says nobody will ever, you already know that this person doesn't know
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:29.060]  what they're talking about.
[01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:29.560]  Yeah.
[01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:30.500]  All right.
[01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:32.020]  Well, I'm going to call that a wrap.
[01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:34.180]  I don't think you had to take the fifth too many times.
[01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:36.260]  But to me, you're easy on me.
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:36.900]  That was pretty good.
[01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:37.300]  You know what?
[01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:43.380]  My biggest takeaway is your enthusiasm for it has reinvigorated my own, which hadn't
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:44.500]  exactly waned.
[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:47.300]  It's just that I haven't gotten to play with it in three months.
[01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:49.140]  And now I'm excited all over again.
[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:54.820]  I'm once again more excited for this coming out next year than I am for anything coming
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:58.820]  out in two weeks, even though I am excited about new iPhones and watches and whatever.
[01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:07.620]  But it's kind of hard to concentrate on iPhone 15 when Vision Pro one is on the horizon.
[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:08.500]  I feel the same way.
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:11.300]  I feel like in a way, you know, it's almost like the Osborne effect or whatever.
[01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:13.460]  But I feel like I know stuff up for the next month.
[01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:16.420]  Just get it out and get it over with so you can get to the next year and get.
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:17.300]  Yeah, no, really.
[01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:18.660]  I agree with you, John.
[01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:19.060]  All right.
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:22.500]  I want you to feel better, get some fluids and get some rest.
[01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:23.860]  But you sound great, really.
[01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:27.060]  Honestly, I wish I sounded as good as you do with covid normally.
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:28.260]  Thank you.
[01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:29.860]  I tried my best to fight it.
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:30.500]  Michael Simmons.
[01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:35.300]  Everybody, of course, can find all of your work at Flexibits.com and anything else you
[01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:35.780]  want to promote.
[01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:37.860]  You want to what's your Mastodon or something like that?
[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:42.900]  Ma'am, I've been trying to avoid the social focusing more on, I don't know, whatever,
[01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:48.580]  anything but getting work done, getting getting work, getting the Apple Vision Pro version
[01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:52.100]  of Fantastical, ready to roll and another platform intent.
[01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:53.620]  Excellent.
[01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:54.020]  All right.
[01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:55.220]  Thank you, Michael.
[01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:55.780]  Thank you, John.
[01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:57.220]  A pleasure, as always.
